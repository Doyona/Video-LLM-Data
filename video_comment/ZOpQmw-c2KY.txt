Ya numair hassan se inspired hu gyAaa😅😅😅😅😅😅
Ye konsi new rasmain mtaarif krwai ja rhi hn. Ye to Indian rasmain hn saari.
zara pehel to khubsurat upor se uska dressing is  fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where are andlib parents
How andaleeb forgot her nands name lol she Said Maria and not nimra wtf
Numair is being Hassan day by day but Hassan is being Numair day by day😂😂
آور آس بچارے کی غلطی بھی نہیں ہے
آس ڈرامے میں مویز کے ساتھ نا انصافی ہوئی ہے
Nepal❤
The last scene shows how Numair doesn’t trust Andaleeb. Very disappointed in him. He was there when she cut ties completely with Moiz at the restaurant. I understand he could have a little uncertainty regarding his physical condition but the best would’ve been to discuss it with Andaleeb, his wife!
Muje Lagt hai Numair zara Se pyar Kar ta hai😂
31:18 Dekh raha hai mujhpe he ya nahi 😂😂😂
9 mahiny ho gy pregnancy b sab kuch but abi tk study ni khtm hui Andleeb ki
😂😂😂😂❤❤
I like it drama
Hi
Numair look like hasan😅
9 month passed in 9 second
Sheffield
Hassan wants to do cycology
Mjhy nafrat hy un mrdo se jo apni bv chor k sbka drd smjhty he like numair
India se mazrat hy ye goud bharai ka hmry islaam se koi talluq nh
Namair bhai weight km krle apna walk like 🐘  😆 🤣
Zara jyc maa kash sbki ho how supportive always😢
Dramay k liye kis ka bacha utha kr laty han 😂
Anda leeb😂
Gooe         🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌻🌻🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🌹🌹
Numair is to bad
34:30 what😢direct puchto lo..eisy chupke chupke areh yaarr
Numair to zara k sath acche bat karte hea to andalip k sath kiw nehi
Kiya yaar nomair ek to tum bap nehi bansakte yei bat shadi k pehle nehi bataye..or jab baccha ayya to eisy dukhi kiw hoo?sablok kithna khush hea.khas kar andalip...
Yahape mawa bohoth acchi hea
I was thinking that the situation of Numair is impossible to solve, and the last scene was the final nail in the coffin. He could never talk about his issue with anyone, not Andaleeb, not his mom. As soon as he mentions that he can’t have kids the suspicion falls on Andaleeb and there’s no recovering from that.
1st numair behaviour or last behaviour changes
Who interested numaie and andeelev scenes
Sab se acha.episode 1 hey ki NAHI
Limra api ko maria api bana diya 😂😂
Allahh numair aisa kese kar sakta h andaleeb ke dill pr kya guzri hogy uffff numair phele jitna acha tha ab utna hy bura hogaya h
At this point, numair is giving off creepy vibes just like hassan!
Arey bhaiya numair ...deebu needs uh the most at this time not anybody else 😢 why what happened 😔
Kash meri mamma bhi mujhe itni himmat dete 😭😭😭
میں بلوچستان
G
Thik drama ❤
Achhe log ke sath achha hota nai hee kabhhii😢
Numair ko dekhkar realise hota he ki insan dusro ke mamlo me samjhdar ho skta he lekin apne mamlo me kabhi samjhdar nhi rehta
numair is the best
27:15 Mawra❤🇮🇳
90:10
24:33
Andleeb kah rhi hai maria aapi ke do bache hain,,,jabki uski nand ka naam to nimra hai 😂
If anyone remember how deebu gave badhua to zara?🥲🥺 Well how strong zara is hats of too her and whatta phenomenal performance marwa did bravo!!!!❤️
Mere to ruksati bhi nh hoi ti net per nikah n just after 2 days divorce mere marzi se lkn tb waqai nh pta tha k divorce its not easy just like Zara
Zara act real
Zara ki toh talak ho Gai thi toh uski iddat ka koi seen hi ni hy 🙄🧐
The baby is soo cute♥️😘😘
ANDALEEB'S BEAUTY ❤
3.57 she said Maria Api instead Nimra api😂
He is doctor but he don’t know only a single hair of baby is enough for DNA test 😂
I want season 2
Numad Zara ko like karnay lga hai or Adeel ko ignore kar rha hai
Numair ko zara se sadi karni thi
Ab Numair irritating ho raha hai agar shak hai tou saaf saaf puchlo bhai 🙄☹️
Oops itni jaldi Andaleep ka stomach bhi nazar agaya lol waki drame mai sab mumkin hai😂😂
28:33 the scene is so emotional it's so related bcz when you're in trauma and trying to heal
Kon kon India se hai
Ye kaisi rasme hai
Numed reaction 30:55
Mawra's acting dude🤌🏻😭 she literally nailed it
In this drama the best performance goes to jara.she nailed it outstanding. I loved her powerful character ❤❤❤❤
Maria api kon h
Moiz would have been a better husband for zara , as he use to make her happy always
❤❤
Sbse faltu acting h andaleeb ki rondu overacting 😂😅zara us so mature ❤
Love is the plant ☘️
At 14:09 I remembered the drama burns road kay Romeo Juliet 😅😅😂😂
Nimra not maria! Set pr Kisi ne dhyan nhi dia not even director 😂
Sad to see numair becoming a typical crack husband ... Acha khasa bndy ke puter ki terah chalty chalty U turn le lia
Glad to not find hasan and dado today 🤣
He should get his sperm count test done and not the infant’s DNA. That’s the easy solution at this point. Getting the baby’s DNA tested will cause more problems in his relationship.
Any pakistani here😊😮
10:48  mard chahe kitna bhi kah le pyar ki baaten jatale ager use ahlam hai unski oart ka koi past hai to wo uske damag se na dill se Saq jata hi nai... Like Numair jyese
Baby name
*This Drama isW Saying That ALLAH's Plan isW Better Than Ur Plan!!!!!*
*The Drama Defines theW ReaL DefinatiOn Of LOve.. LOve isW NOt AbOut Dying fOr SOmeOne but ALways Being ALive & Being happy FOr SOmeOne!!!!!*
*A Husband Lyk Dr. Numair & Wife Lyk Dr. Zara.. Suchh A Blessing FrOm ALLAH!!!!!* ❤❤❤
He
Pakistani drama hai ya
Good drama
Who noticed that andaleeb called Maria instead of nimra while talking to her mother😅😅😅😅
Only Indian likes Karo
Her mushkil ma Allah say hi rabta krna chaye is k elawa aur koi nahi.
Starting new useless rasams , “goad bharai” and “ nashta” to brides susral. Rubbish
I think Numair should take psychiatrist's consultation
I finished this serial in 2 days 😂
Me b zaara hon .. or mra ghr b nai bcha... Lekin domestic violence nai tha.. narcassist person he was
16:39 Sharjeena's dad from KMKT
Talaq ek rishta khatm hone ka naam nahin hai talaq ek jindagi khatm hone ka naam hai mister numer
am just counting to watch this show only for andaleep😅
Support me please
Nimraa kaa name change ho k mariya hogyaa is episode mein...😁😁😁
Love❤❤❤
ye jo rasam hui h drama me ye toh indian krty h ye kab se pakistan me hone lag gae hai rasam
Ha
3:57 she said Maria appi k do bachy hain.jb ky nand ka nam nimra  hai aur Maria iski saas ka naam hai
Andalep is imature. Deep down Umair has a feeling for Zara
Numair is wrong ....usy Andleeb ko sach btana chahiye tha
Baby is smiling ❤️😍cute
I love the way they have portrayed Naumair's Character. The character development from a picture perfect unrealistic character to a humane realistic character who has to struggle with his thoughts. I love his character❤
This is the only drama that we didn’t skip any parts
Does anyone else remember when Andaleeb gave badua to zara😭
Hats off to the writer to bring the importance of mental health and that its okay to see a therapist…

31:20 very funny yar
Any muslil gere ??????❤❤
One absolute great thing of this drama is numair offers salah and talks to our rabb instead of going to darga😂😂 Thankfully this drama doesn't promote such stuff👏👏👏
Noumair to aisa lagta apni biwi se jayada zara se pyaar karta hai 😮
😊😊😊😊
❤❤❤❤
What kind of foolishness and nonsense is it with numair,instead of talking with his own wife ,he talks and takes more care of Zara,it seems he has fallen in love with Zara and has started hating Andaleeb Who agree with me?

Numair apna munh kyun khula rakhta hai itna
I did all this, gardening,  reared a pup to be a big dog, got my father's house refurnished, added new things, and started going to a nearby slum to teach children. Slowly I came out of the trauma of being shattered.
Yes from Punjab india
So cute ♥️ baby
Kon kon india se dak raha hai
any Indian here 🤚🇮🇳😂😂
Its so nice to see numair n zara’s conversations…finally a drama where we can see real life problems instead of those stupid saas bahi n mazloom larki dilemmas…em loving dis drama to max ….specially numair is da bestest amongst cast …..he is looking n behaving like a mature sensible emotional doctor
Allah ka shuker ha k hum  Nebi pak k ummeti  hain
Bhot achha lagta he jb numair anadeel ko apni good me leta he❤❤❤❤❤
Andelif❤❤❤
What is Numair’s problem? Miracles happen. He should be happy about his baby. His wife needs his emotional support in this hour.
The secene where Zara remembered her memories of marriage and becaming sad.i really cried 😢
Numair understanding Zara problem and feelings but not understanding his wife ,so unhappy men.numair becoming Hassan day by day 😂😂😂
Ya drama ma baby kaha sa ate ha😮
Yaaaaaaaeeeeeehhhhiii ❤❤❤❤
Numair ko kab pata Chala k wo baap nahi ban sakta😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Numair  should go for counselling  also
India  mein rahkre bhi indian muslim ne kisi gair muslim ki kisi bhi riti riwaj ko apnaya nahi shukr hai Allah ka or ye pakistani permote krte rahte hai faishan k naam pr shirk
Nice 🎉

Pahly nand ka nam nimrah tha ab Mariya ban giya

Numair Andleeb par shaq kar kai bohot galat kar raha hai. I can't believe ki Numair Andleeb par doubt karai gaa i hate Numair. I think everyone agree with me
Ye log dog ke kaise hath laga dete hain
Abe yaar kitne lambe episode banae hue

Yes
I think idr zara aur numair kii shadi hogi
Zara k doctor k kia name hi
Just thora sa frq reh gya hai Hassan & Numair m
All indian is here❤
34:34 Am I the only one who thinks Andaleeb's facial expressions after knowing about the DNA test are not of shock, astonishment, or sadness, but of fear. It seems to me as if she's scared that he is doing a DNA test, as if she's apprehensive that her secret will be out, as if she's anxious what will happen now.
Zara mai hu😢😢
I like zara who never compare her life with any other girl' married life like andleeb she always show to other that she is more happy 😊 but she feels pain 😢she is so strong and calm down person.she never blame to andleeb for she cursed to her before 😢
17:00 jab ye seen dekhi  to yaad aya class 12 english poem chapter  A road side stand...poet ..(robert frost) same wahi seen lag rahi thi...❤❤
Andaleeb apni sister in law ka naam galat leti hai. She is Nimra  n andaleeb calls her Maria aapi
Andaleeb apni sister in law ka naam galat leti hai. She is Nimra  n andaleeb calls her Maria aapi

numair to chumair nikla 😂 Abey Apna Khud ka ilaz karva ke pata kar ki baap ban sakta hai ki nehi😂
نمیر کو پہلی رپورٹ  کو اتنا سریس نہیں لینا تھا  دی این ٹیسٹ سے پہلے اپنے ٹیسٹ کروا لیتا تو یہ اذیت نہ سہمتا۔ ایسے مرد خود کو ان فٹ سمجھتے دنیا کا سامنا کرنے سے ڈرتے ہیں یہ کوئ آنا کا مسئلہ نہیں سپشل ایک ڈاکٹر کو سمجھ۔ ھونی چاہیے تھی کہ خدا پاک کے ہاتھ میں سب کوئ رپورٹ حتمی نہیں ھوتی ۔۔اصل طاقت خدا کو ہے جیسے نواز دے کب نواز دےے   ایسے مردوں کے لیے مسیج ہے کہ آنا کا علاج کا مسئلہ نہ  بنائیں  اپنی بیوی کو اعتماد میں لے کر ٹیسٹ دوبارہ ھو سکتے تھے دونوں ڈی این اے اس طرح کرانا عورت کے کردار کشی ہے
Yar mujhe numair pe sach main bohot ghussa a raha he yeh kar kya raha he tum aik doctor ho 2 mint main dna karwa ke pata ker sakte ho or mene jese hi yeh comment sara likh liya wese hi us ne pyaar se apni beti ko utha liya 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
Numair's character is highly confusing and to be honest, infuriating at this point. It was bad enough that he was hot & cold, and not communicating openly with Andaleeb. Then he didn't tell her about his medical history which was her right to know as his wife and the mother of his child. And now, he's going behind her back, lying to her, and secretly taking their daughter for a DNA test like a creepy kidnapper?   Also the whole doubt thing is sooo disrespectful towards Andaleeb. How can he even think of such a thing? Did he not listen to her during that cafe scene where she refuses Moiz & shows her loyalty towards Numair? Also Numair is a doctor how can he not know that medical miracles are possible, and despite his medical condition there was still a chance he could have a biological child? I mean, why is this so unbelievable for him that he's doubting his wife??? Medical miracles, especially ones around infertility, are not uncommon and any doctor knows that!!  Honestly Andaleeb deserves better. Numair has been so unfair to her. His hot & cold behavior and now this mistrust must be so hurtful for Andaleeb, and we see it too when she cries. Seriously, he puts down his own baby and leaves the hospital room? Who acts like that while holding their child for the very first time?   Numair was supposed to be a "green flag." he's anything but that.  P.S: no he doesn't deserve a medal or appreciation for "not being abusive" thats literally even less than the bare minimum.
He match his baby to himself 😅
What is numair doing 😂
Iam indian
Yes
Numai ka muh 31:07 p 😂😂😂😂😂
The way Zara explained...her  trauma..so real 😢❤
Yeh Numair Bhai ka Muh Hamesha khula q rehta h😅😂
Any Indian here ❤
Mjy ye smjh nh ATI ye dramas KY Liye log itny concerne q hojaty apni advice aysy dety jese wakai numain prh kr ye sb phr apni wife KY 7 acha behave kryga 😂 seriously
DNA k bajaye apna medical dubara bhi to krwaskta tha lkn shak insaan ko kahin ka nahi chorta
Mujhey tu samajh nahi araha ke nomair ko konsi bimari hai
Numair is very boring type person,who should not any plan to be happy
Ary Bhai bachi ky bjaye apna medical test krwaleta itny mahinon sy sub ki musibat krdi
Lgrha h Hasan k baad ek aur psycho enter ho gya drama me those name is numer  😅😅😅😅
Is drama mai sb pagal hen😂
Well said numair  about divorce
Finally, Zara divorced, not like all serie
Nice
No
Numir sab ko good man lga lakin os ka is  ak next part sa sab osy bura kha ray ha asa ni huta ap dakhn os na khd ko itna time kasy planely cover kia hua tha osy andeelb Asi ni lagti lakin os na khd Ka yaqeen ka lia agr DNA krwa liaya to It's not a big issue  Os ba time pa sunty koi react ni kia os na patience kia next time ka
Kl kis kis ki group discussion hai?
Numair is becoming Hasan day by day 😂
Doctor Sahab to منٹو کے افسانے pad raha han 😅
Actually numair is also not wrong wo nhi chahta ki andleeb pe Shaq na kare par situation hi aisi hai wo bhi andar se pareshan hai kisi se baat nahi kar sakta isliye uska behaviour aisa ho gya hai
Hr dramy men beti hue h q bolty hn beta q ni 😅😅😅
Numair solving Zara problems but avoiding his own..!!
Don't understand the behaviour of Numair that is he happy or not?😢
What a rubbish numair being a person who offered her wife to leave him for her boyfriend but now he is not accepting his child what is this... How an educated man b like that
Maria or nimra ??
Yes I am
If anyone is going through any depression or indulge in trauma than person should be invole with nature that relax the mind
He shouldn't rude with her own wife where she wants support of his husband...Numair  nebha rha hai achi dosti
, next
You are write
Drama ni dekha😂😂😂 ... Yh wli ep reels ma Dkhi tu yha sa drama shru krdiya😂

Is pooray dramay ka sb se toxic character hai Numair.... usay pata tha k wo baap nhin ban sakta phr bhi us ne shadi ki aur wo bhi itni kam umar ledki say, literally he has ruined her life, wo tou miracle hogaya jo wo pregnant hogaee.... Numari ki sari achhaee srf uska guilt chhupanay k lye thee aur ab wo Andleeb k character pr shak kr raha hai jo bachi ka paternity test kerwa raha hai.... ghatya admi...  Aur us k baad toxic hain Andleeb k maa baap, jis tarah se zabardsti unhon ne Andleeb ki shadi ki wo islam mein najayiz hai but nobody is talking about it..... bajaye Andleeb ki counselling kernay k unhon ne uski zabardast shadi kerdi aur jitni dafa bhi wo ghar wapis aee usay support kerni k bajaye laat maar kr wapis bhej diya . Wo tou uska husband Numari guilt ka maara insaan tha jo usay apnay faiday k lye wapis rekh leta tha(werna tou bechari ka bura hashar hota) lekin ab waqt aanay pr us ne apni auqaat dikha di...... aisay maa baap ko tou zeher de dena chahiye.  Is pooray dramay ki wahid aur sb se achhi baat zoya ki divorce hai, it is fantastic!!!!!! aur us k baad ki situation ko jitni achhi tarah se portray kia hai , zabarast!!
❤❤😂😂😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think numair hid this secret from his parents too all his life because it was embarrassing for him to share it with anyone. May be the report he got was not his.. the reports got mixed with someone else and numair lead all his life believing that he is infertile. Who knows 🤷🏻‍♀️ we cannot blame numair for his condition and thoughts coming to his mind
Har darmy mai hendon k rasam ghoad baraye hamary mazhab mai kaha hai ju ye daramu walye logu ko naye naye rasmaye sekha rahy hai 😢😢😢😢
Numair is the bangladeshi flag😂😂😂😂 ab green sa red forest oh rha ha

Sari chize is temporary  And numair ka muh khula rehna is permanently 😂😂
Zara and deebu ka natok bohot acchi ha ❤❤
those who are cursing Numair, put yourself on his shoe. He is at least trying to keep his calm and stop suspecting. But he is a human, he can't control all his thoughts and emotion
In whole pregnancy behavior or husband is so imp..he can discuss the matter instead of being upset all the time and making his wife upset too
😊
Kis Kis ko Akhari Nabi ka umati honay per fakhar ha 🤠💚💚💚💚💚💚✅

Ana drama  mein bi to yehi Usman Mukhtar tha, udhr to itna Acha act Kia tha .....idhr boht dfa boht dfa acting aur body language scene k hisab sy weird lgti aur proper ni Hoti......axr scenes mein  uski smile fake lgti.....pehly jb couple apas mein biklul sahi thy tab bi smile fake lgti thi usman ki ..... Aur kafi scenes mein less confident body language  Kis kis NY notice Kia?

Episode 26????
Why numair hid that he can’t be a father,doesn’t it scary and cheating to her wife too ,his flexibility towards moiz and andleeb now showing his weakness because he himself was hiding a big flaw,andleeb mistake was not a mistake but his lie is a big mistake cuz it is the matter of life how girl can spend her life without knowing that her husband can’t be a father
How beautifuly Zara explain her thoughts it's v real no one can understand this condition.. only victim know the pain of separation😢
This is not present in Islam but typical Hindu ceremony
Yas Kashmir  sa

OMG what a violation of trust at the end
زارا کا ہسبنڈ سائیکو دکھایا تھا جبکہ نمیر اس سے بھی بڑا سائیکو ہے۔  dual personality disorder, زارا کے سامنے اور ، عندلیب کے سامنے بالکل مختلف۔
sehar’s expression are as if she has actually done something wrong. and Mawra did amazing job
This drama beautifully portrays the concept of parhi likhi larki and the impact it have on generations Zara's parents let her study accomplish her dreams and supported her throughout her journey is so precious it is also beautiful that they knew the value of their daughter and got her out of the toxic relationship on time
Seriously  Numair ek doctor ho k ye ni Janta k test k lye baby ko hospital Le jana zrori ni h just sample le jae or test krwa le Kon kon agree krta h is baat se
He is right in his place. Andalib is correct instead of Andalib. Such is the situation. How can a man whose medical reports say he has a 1℅ chance of being a father and the rest say 99℅ not be normal?Andalib's past is there From this point of view, his character is still quite good. They don't understand anything until they are children. Yes, I was disturbed in myself. normal
Numai to zara k husband se bhi jyada scary and psycho lg rha h😂
Who came here after watching the Instagram DNA reel?

Dramas like this making women posiotion strong like the way namiar mother accepted andleep and never used bad words for her i hope people will seek something from it
I am so glad that they are showed both situations where therapist is needed. People with mental disorders and the people who are going through hard phase without a mental disorder. Both need therapy.
❤❤😂
34:31 we didn’t expect that 🙂💔
31:40 how boring 😅💔
Bangladesh se kon kon h 🇧🇩
Baby is so cute
Something mysterious is going on , either numair is hidding something or andaleeb is hiding something.

Bht fazool acting hai Numair ke. He acts the same way no matter which drama he is part of.
Some of you criticising Numair like the green flag men like him do really exist..his character is the reality.
𝓘 𝓵𝓸𝓿𝓮 𝓪𝓵𝓵𝓱𝓪 ❤❤
Agar pehley e numair zara se sadi kar leta to.....drama e na banta 🤣🤣

Why didn’t  Zara and numair married ? Both are good friends then why didn’t so confused
👍🏼💐🇮🇳good good so gooddrama drama
DNA nail & hairs b ho jata. He is a doctor. Baby ko hospital ly kr jane ki kiya zrort
Goud bharai is hindu ritual not Muslims
Like this drama Jafaa , YES I like
Lovely style lovely cost  Zabardast drama...  Love 💕 music
EXACTLYYYYYYY
Mawra is doing an excellent job as Zara. Her expressions shows her pain and depressions perfectly. The conversations of Zara about her divorce and the pain she is going through shows the real pain of divorcee women. I am glad that this drama gave the message that it is much needed to take therapy for betterment. Sehar's acting was too good, her expression at the last scene was heartwrenching. The pain is really unbearable for a loyal wife😢😢
Mtlb andaleeb ny kasy jldi ki ????😅😢
Last episode is just coming, those who waiting for the happy ending ❤ . . .. .. Thnx for 1 like 🤕
Ye he sot ziddi c drame me phna hy zara ki mama ne
When Jesus says to us, ( unless you become like little children you will not enter the kingdom of heaven) . He is recalling us to our lost childhood. Giving us the opportunity to be reborn in innocence of character. Lord Jesus says we cannot enter the kingdom unless we receive it like child. Children are more suited to the kingdom they know how to receive gift. No one can enter the kingdom of God who is not open to receive it as a gift. God bless us all. Amen
In the end both the doctors are going to get married.
Jab shak karne ka phase tha tab kabhi Numair ko shak ni hua tha Debu pae aor ab jab ky Moiz ka chapter close hogya hai….isko shak horha apni biwi par. Khud ky dil main chor hai aor relationship apna khrab krha.  He hid his medical condition. Jhota tau khud hai. Aor wese bhi sperm count down hone ka mtlab yeh tau ni ky bikul bhi baap ni ban sakta. That’s in Allah’s hands. He can do miracles.Itni weak faith ni hona chiyae. Very bad !!!
Numair is behaving like psycho more than hassan
Iss dramy mein sbko psychiatrist ki zrurat hai
Mashallah baby is so cute
Numair sabko bhttt mature lgta tha starting me... haqiqat ye hai ke pehle log farishta banne ki koshish karte hain ar baad me wo kuchh nhi bhoolte
Allah is the best planner
Hi
1:35 Zara’s mother is wearing the same  dress she wore in woh ziddi si before she died!!

Dono doctors pagal hei, patients ko kyaa treat karenge, ek husband paagal hei, Anduleep ko bhee paagal banaayenge kyaa 😮
Double faces acting so....😂😅
Everyone in drama is mental patients
14:43
In this drama everybody needs their separate psychiatrist... I think the producer must be a psychiatrist himself or herself
Bkwas hogya hy drama
New rasm fazool meh humaray mulk meh shaamil karnay ke liyhe ah ghee hay..

Boht ACHa massage dia sir apny Zara or mujhy b  Thank you therapist ❤
26:40 to 26:55 really it's is best part of this episode 😊❤
Maybe numair likes Zara😂
Drama is like a therapy
Am so glad ki Zara or Hasan ko sath m na dikha ke move on karte dikha rahe h acha msg de rahe hai ki toxicity jhelna nahi ussey nikalna m behtari h  Or sath Zara'acting is brilliant but today andaleeb stole the show with her expressions  Abhi tak sahi jaa raha h sab hope aage bhi aisa hi ho ❤😊 Love from Bharat
Yes
Yy
Yaar seher ko budhe budhe actor ke Sath kyon role dete hai 😂😂😂 na insafi Hui hai hamari little pari ke sath😢😂😅
Kis kis ko gussa ho raha har numair ka weird behaviour ka upar ???
Itna bakwas q banarhe he yrr ye DNA name ka bhi test hota he kya yrr Dr. Hokar farltu dikha rhe h ye
Numair Zara best friend hai par Numair Andaleeb se zyada Zara ke sath comfortable rehta hai, usko zyada guide krta hai, jitna zara se bat krta hai uske aadha bhi Andaleeb s nahi bat karta
Numair to Hasan banta chala ja rha😢
Yaaa  I'm Indian
Kiya hai yr 😢 jafaa ke har episode lest ate hai kitne wait karte hu next episode dekne ke liye 😊
😢😢😢😢😢
Not defending him, but it's his right to know about the baby.
Muje lgta hai numair zara ko psnd krta tha but zara ko keh nii skha kabhi
Godh bharai ki rasam toh hindus mei hoti hai na muslims mei kabse hone lagi
Kis kis ko lagta h boring hogya h drama
Your abu
seriously numair think’s this child belongs to moiz 😂
We are indian
26 ?
Itne saal baad ek ep upload karte ho jab puri life khatam ho jaye gi us din last episode aaye ga😂😂
No
Biwi ka khayal rakha nahi jaa raha or dost ka itna khayal rkh rha h smjh se bahir h
Yeh kon sii rasam hai Andleeb kii.. Indian Culture sy inspired fully..
I think Numair Iike Zara 😢
What kind of Doctors are these? They themselves need therapy!
29:20 What the name of andaleeb girl.....??
Bhaiyo 26 episode kab ayega
Aap thoda jaldi dala karee episode ham wait karte h aap itane Dino ke baad dalte hai episode 😢
In comment section most of the people call numair as a red flag🚩 but in my opinion numair is still a green flag 🇸🇦 even he know that in 99% case he cant be a father of a child and andaleeb had a past relationship, its normal for him to have a doubt on andaleeb's pregnancy, in anxiety and doubt still he don't behave typically and behave nice to her and take care of her ,she looks happy, .... In anxiety and doubt he don't put his anger on her, drinking 🍻 or smoking but offered namaz and pray to Allah🤲🏻 Sorry for my english 😅 but guys understand my opinion 👍🏻
Zara's parents are the best parents in the world
How can female be so active and fresh after giving birth  The pain we pass through i now understand after giving birth to my first child dramas show fake presentation of active female after childbirth
After seeing zara mjy shadi se khoof aarha hy 😢
Numair ko apni biwi se jada zara ke upar fikar h 😂😂😂😂haad h
Listen people,these counseling sessions zara taking are really very helpful, within few sessions u feel the difference and easily get out of any kind of trauma. Do seek help when u need it . don't be embarrassed in seeking help
Any on bangladesh here🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
16:20 Aaj Zara ne rula diya 😢
Trust nhi to Kuch nhi Chahy Kitna b green flag hojao

I think Numair is interested in Zara and worry about her and day by day he is becoming rude with his wife 😢
Winter+dramas❤
Ok so the story Is twisting Hasan is getting recovered and Numair is being psycho🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
Numair is an Unromantic boy also I don't like him so much but the first one is perfect boy
Bro numair go for a DNA test!
Numair behavior was not well with andleeb
Numair is becoming Bangladesh flag 😢
This drama aslo shows that no body is perfevt... Jo log dr numair jsa jsa nd ki wish kr ri ti mry smed😅
Sharjeena's father is now a therapist 😂🤣
Hats off to the makers..how beautifully they portrayed the trauma, divorce and abuse..and what healing looks like ..hats off to Mawra for taking up such beautiful character and playing it so well❤❤this girl is pure magic 💖
It's totally heart wrenching when numair take his baby for DNA 😢😢
Zara nailed it ❤
❤❤❤
Koi Indian nahi hai
Good acting
How beautifully Zara performed the character....Dr Zara is a real example that how strong women can also going through a lot....and can also be broken🙃hats off I just love her performance excellent 🎉❤lastly every Zara deserve a friend like Dr numair😃
He also needs a therapist.
OMG the last scene  is Heart breaking for all the loyal women..... I am single but still I can feel that pain badly  ufff.....

The timing of his personal trauma is not making sense. If he knew about infertility he should have addressed that before marriage. There is no forgiveness for that.
Kisi ne notice kiya Nimra ko Mariya boli 😂😂😂
26 apisod bhaj le 😊
Any Bangladesh here???😊😅
Yrr Numair mirror mein kaise apne face se baby ki face match krta hai ya nhi dkh raha hai🤣
Is drame ke to saare doctor hi Mareez hain
I think zara ko deebu ki bad dua hi lagi h jo usny APNI shadi k din di thi
jafaa drama is  my favorite
Right now ab sara ki zindagi bilkul meri tarah ho chuki h💯💯💯🥺💔
31:28 😂😂😂😂😂
30:38 pr numair jaise bache ko dekh rha hai bachi bhi same expression se numair ko dekh rhi hai 😂😂😂😂
Numair pura pagal hai 🤣🤣
28:44 zara is not going crazy...she is just in the journey of re- finding herself through nature
25:18  best part
26:27 the baby looks extra small in numair's hands....mtlb uske ek haath se bhi zyada choti hai....cutieeee
16:28 her pain....mawra is killing it!!  I could feel zara's every tear!
14:24 dil pe nahi lete? Are you sure this is what a therapist would say to a freshly divorced individual?!😂
Part 26 kab ayega ..??
I started disliking numair’s character for being friendly, more understanding towards zara but not his own wife not even talking to her or discussing anything. At the end family is more important than a friend, numair is now a red flag as a partner
❤❤❤gafa and love
Sharjeena ke papa ye kaam krte the
Nomair Bai plz ESA na karein Andleep k Sath..wo bohat innocent ha..
Wafa  to ha but jafa nahi ha in ka ishq me😂😂😂
Story line is quite good and simple but directing should l be batter. Script is also not good.  I think this drama could be more better.
Yr ajeeb character Hy, doctor hoty wy bhi itna preshan ho rha hy
It’s been 22 years and still very difficult 😢 no matter how hard it is you have to deal with it and it’s extremely painful 😖 no one will understand unless you dealt with it :(
34:31 Numair is trying to his baby DNA Test.😶
Ya Allah tu hum sabko double minded hone se hifazat karna ! Ameen 😢😢😢😢🤲🤲🤲
Iss bachchi ne toh drama mein twist daal diya hai ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Anyone noticed Andaleeb said Maria Api instead of Nimra api 😂
i dont know why i feel Numer love zara 😂😂😂😂
Dactor zara ka😅😂😢Kia damagh kharb kr diea with 🐕 dog
Koi mjy achy psychologist ka bta de mjy bhe apny husband ka checkup krwana hy same condition hy . Koi bhe ksi bhe city ksi bhe country ka dr ko
9:31 watching this drama
Zara, I can understand what you are saying. You are absolutely right. People don't understand these things.This is not just Zara's dialogue, it is the translation of my heart.
Unacceptable change in the character of Numair. Right from the beginning the director portrayed him to be a mature, decent, un orthodox & educated person. Breaking stero type Husbands but at stage, they ruined his image with this  mentality. He being a doctor advising Zaara for therapy but when it comes to. Him, he didn't even once got himself assessed his fertility. Sudden behaviour change is just not goig with his character. 😅😅😅Seems funny the writer wanted to just stretch the Drama with unnecessary actions.
Numair jesa open apni frnd zara k sath rehta wes biwi k sth ni hta
to bhai why not going for dna test
Bohat he boring drama hogya hy ye ab
yey usman mukhtar ka mouth always thora open kun rehta hay
U need to read the quran and understand  it  al ur probs will easy load
numair is turning into his Hum kahan ky sachy thy character
This is why its so important to be honest and communicate!! Numair should tell Andaleeb his thoughts
24:10 numairs acting expressions on point... The way he expressed the feeling of doubt and anger overlapping because of the doubt and then trying to calm himself and thinking that no it's nothing everything is fine and then again won't be able to think straight... Wooooooh ... Why nobody noticed that...?
By the way the baby girl looks like Numair 😂😂😂
Numair should marry Zara
Numair apni bv sy zyada batein to zara sy kr leta hy
14:11 ❤❤❤❤
Amazing i love zara mother her ma ku apni beti k lie ase he dost bn k rehna chahye❤😊

1:43 "ghar toot'ta hai toh himmat toot jaati hai" This is so real, no matter how strong a person is, no matter how bad of a reason there is for a divorce, but ending a marriage ia never easy!
26.32 ❤❤❤❤❤
Numair ko Zara k husband Hona chaiye tha kyu ki wo us k  zada khayal karta hai apni wife ko muh nahi lagta hai had hai yar kitni cute biwi hai is ki numair

Aree yrr numair ab tum bhi Hassan na bno please dono mil kr misunderstanding clear kr lo but ye sb rona dhona udaasi nhi chahiye.... Fvrt serial ko fvrt hi rhne do please
Numair loves zara 😢
Zara ny kmal ki acting ki jb therapist k pas thi
Zara divorce nai lati chali jati Hassan ka Ghar sa Kuch time jab theak hojata ah jati
I am online quran teacher👩‍🏫
Numair ki acting bohat zabardast hai well done director and producer
No
34:31 he wasted all in just one sec
Andaleeb said Maria aapi instead of Nimra aapi 3:57 😂 Maria tou iss ki sasu ma ka naam hai. 😂
26 episode please
8:00  nabi pak ny frmaya ha k jo dusri قوموں ki مشابہت ikhtiyar kry ga wo uni ma sy ha
Yeh godh bharayi ki rasam is not our culture 🤦‍♀️
Dadi was the real culprit in the case of zara, and Numair such a weak character btw
If numair can understand zara's pain why not andleebs
Any USA viewers hare ❤❤?
Numair as a friend tou buht acha hai aur dialogues bhe hain but as a hubby zero
Ufff this episode was goosebumps
Andaleeb 😢😢
good twist when Andleeb came to know DNA thing
Yes
Masha Allah  kitna piyara baccha he 😍
My love drama
Are ye mustfa ke sasur yahan bhi 😢😢
Bujhlma na andeeleb er pet 2 weeks eto boro kamne🐸
❤❤❤❤
One moment numair is so happy and second moment he is so sceary
Zara look very beautiful in pink dress just looking like a wow❤
Therapist is my favourite
Whi notice sharjeena's dad here
Numair is very nice
Numair biwi pe shak ni kr rha or na krna cahta ha magr ye DNA test uski  satisfaction k liye ha or i think wo ye baat debu ko clear kr lay ga
Lo ji, bohut green flag kar rahe the ho gaya, green flag turning into red flag, congrats!!!
Numair ko lagta hai ki vo baacha kisi aur ka hai isliye vo khush nahi tha aur vo baache ka dna test karane aaya tha aur ye baat andleeb ko bhi pata chal gayi thi ab dekhte hai aage kya hota hai aur zara ke apne ander jo dard bhara huaa tha usko bahar nikal rahi thi
Numair is Bangladesh flag 🇧🇩  A green flag with red spot
Hasan ka Bhoot numair m aa gya ky😮😂
After, Numair's cold attitude, i think andaleeb would require a doctor, he is not supporting her, when she needs him the most, disgusting where he is doubting Andaleeb's child, please take a good tum, want a happy ending
Yes
Andleeb ny akely e jldi kr de kyaaa numair ka koi aml dkhl nh ?? Had ay
I feel very bad to sara
Boht zabrdst
Ye therapist k pas jana ameero k chonchly hoty hy middle or lower class family m esa nh sochta koi b na e lrki ko koi smjta hy na e uska koi hmraz hmdrd bnta hy na usko koi sikhata hy wo khud e ro dho kr thk ho jati hy
Zara speaks practical.people make divorce harder than it's
The worst thing about this drama is “weekly ones” 🤦🏻‍♀️
Any Bangladeshi here
Ab last episode ho jana chahiye
Dadi ma is my fathers era he’s about 80 and I am 58 and that time he told me to leave you don’t want your children to become like him so I rate my parents for that and they’re backed me up all the way. I’m glad they’re showing this now Pakistan should’ve done this long time ago. Make dramas like this.
Alhamdulillah I am proud that I am an Indian
❤❤❤❤❤
finally ❤🎉
Numair also need a psychiatrist 😂
No
Any nepal here?¿😅❤
Who else is watching from Bangladesh🇧🇩
Numair Kuch zyda hi Zara Zara kr rha... I don't like them together... Wife ko ignore friend ko importance...is not good
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
3:56 Numair ki sister ka naam tu nimra hy 😂😂😂 Andaleeb said maria aapi.maria numair ki ammi ka naam hy😂😂😂😂😂
Yeh kuch zyada hi toofan nhi hua ..aek episode main pregnant ...doosrai main delivery
Numair is too pretty with Zara,rathar Andaleeb 😂
Numair ki sister ka naam to Nimra ni Tha?? Andaleeb ne kaha Maria aapi k do bchy thy Zahir h pta hoga Numair ko rasoomat ka😂😂😂
4:03 Maria aapi 😂😂ya Nimra aapi
Ufffff therapist theory ❤ amazing
Ufffff therapist theory ❤ amazing
Ufffff therapist theory ❤ amazing
MashaAllah itni pyari baby, bilkul andaleeb ki tarah lag rahi hai.
numair say chirh ho rahee hay mujhe
JUST GET A DNA TEST!!!!!! 🥵
Dosry larkon k sath affair hoga tu asa he hoga shak...
Lots of love from Nepal❤❤
Lots of love from Nepal❤❤
Pait pe hath rakh k btana zaruri hota hy 😏
Kitna b dr keh ley chances nhi hein.Allah kay leyey kuch mushkil nhi kay kisi ko nwaz de. Kya itna he asaan hai keh socha jayey kay bacha apka nhi. Her husband ko pata hota hai keh uski b v kaisyee hai.kisi or kay nikah mein hotey howey kisi or kay saath bachaa honaa aik bohat he namumkin  si baat hai.aisa krna asaan nhi. Isko aisey show kr rehein hein jaisey araam se ho sakta hai aisa like normal practice hai in our society, which is absurd.  Yahaan baat shak ki nhi hai, Yaqeen ki hai
Why dont he discuss his med cond with his wife..they can clarify it..well its drama and ppl do behave like this.its reality ,no katter how much we get educated .all have flaws
Numair could've just gotten another test done, maybe his initial report was wrong instead of pulling this BS
Mawra was amazing at 16:00
Numair do not want baby
any bangladesh here ? 🇧🇩
Yar doctor  ka bhi shak apni jaga sahee hay kio kay us kp bata  gaya tum  main bacha paida karnay ki 90 percent chance naheen  hay aur larki apni jaga sahee  hay drama interesting  hogaya hay dhalkain again ep main kia hota hay weldone
26 : 39 ❤😊
Boaring
Yes I'm from India ❤
Numair is very interested in zara 🙂
Can't imagine andaleeps and numairs situation ❤️both are broken
Numair's feelings is fair💯can't blame him
DNA test sb thik kr de gaa
😂😂but the baby looks like moiz🤣
I don't know why Zara is behaving like this .... Common she was a good doctor and intelligent..n now she will end up with the same therapist as his ex is going to
How beautiful it is to see that Numair is fighting with his vicious thoughts. He bows to Allah and asks the guidance then again he can't decide things. Actually it is natural human phenomena. Sometimes when someone tries to provoke us against our dear ones we try to reject him and show positivity but later in life things start to disturb us k us bndy ne jsky baary m wrong baat ki thi hm us bndy ki baat ko tally krna start kr dety hn.... Or kuch time k ly zaroori distract hojaty hn. Numair k sath b asa he ho ra hh.. He will soon come to the right path 😊
14:05 sharjeena ke Abba yaha😂
Debu ye nimra appi ka name mariya kab ho gya
Aysi sas humna nahi dekhi
Dr zara father changed??
Ab to Bhai ye drama dheere dheere boring hota jara hai 🙄🥱

Idkwhy i dont like numair caring toomuch for zara but not giving enough attention to his wife
best drama not like typical dramaaas saas baho 😮nand bhabi best understanding peaceful drama😊❤
Yes I
Vote for daily episode jafa QC lo
Hi
Hasan and numair exchanged their personalities😑🤣
You dont need to take the baby in the hospital to make a DNA test
Numair is doing DNA due to his own cancer related risk and transmitting it to her daughter. Its not for paternity
So cute pie
Numair become a bangladesh flag 🇧🇩red spot on green flag.....😂
Kya  by.hooddaa Rasoomaat START kr di hwen hen inhon ne
I just love this drama ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😅😅❤❤❤
Touseeq haider❤
Papa ki princess agaya😊
مجھے تو یہ سمجھ نہیں اتی کہ نمیر جو ایک بہت روشن خیال اور پڑھا لکھا ڈاکٹر دکھایا گیا ہے اور اس کا کردار بھی بہت متوازن ہے اس کے باوجود وہ شخص جس طرح سے رد عمل دے رہا ہے وہ انتہائی احمقانہ ہے پہلے نمبر پہ اگر وہ ایون پریگننسی میں ڈی این اے ٹیسٹ وغیرہ کا کر سکتا تھا اگر اس کو شبہ تھا دین اگر اس کو شبہ نہیں تب بھی جب وہ پیدا ہو گیا ہے اپنے اپ صرف کونسلنگ کرنے کے باوجود وہ جو حرکتیں کر رہا ہے وہ قابل قبول نہیں ہے بالکل بھی۔ یا تو وہ اس شبے سے نکل آے یا اس شبے کو دور کر لے ڈی این اے ٹیسٹ کے تھرو یا پھر اپنے اپ کو مکمل طور پر سمجھانے میں کامیاب ہو جائے اور جو حرکتیں کر رہا ہے وہ سمجھ سے باہر ہے ایک حقیقت پسند پڑھا ایسی حرکتیں نہیں کر سکتا
Husband wife ka zyada Age difference ho to yahi situations aati hai hamesha husbands Ahsas e kamtari mein mubtila rahte hain
Any Bangladesh here
Kash andaleeb ke thra bche Dena asaan hotha 😂
Numair face always serious never smiling
why the hell all night i tried to watch this episode inUk and it was unshown😢
I think numair jaara se muhabbat karte hain
Plz,god Bharai ki rassam ko promote Mut karain .waisy story achi hy.
Baby ka kiya name hai...?
We loved Numair as a perfect husband supporting and trusting his wife and now he thinks the baby is not his how disgusting very disappointed 😡
Seher Khan is very pretty ❤❤❤❤🎉
Today i realized numair is the biggest psychopath here 😂the way he was trying to match his face with the child and those expression killed me😂
Jafaa lovers comment here
The way numair match face with his baby was very funny 😅
Nice drama
Any Pakistani here ??
Buht peara drama likha aur act kia gia hai
Andleep ny jo last seen m green dress phena ha kis shop ka ha???????

Please yah sub na kya kro yah sub to inda ky daramas main hota hai we are muslm or moslmanon waly kam karin kyon logon ko gomra kr rahien hain i feel is very bad😡😡😡😡😡😡
Ab numair par ghussa araha hai dosray insan ki khaslat ki bataien kar raha hai khud ki khaslat kya hai apni wife ko samjh nai raha usk sath attitude hi alag rakha howa hai or sath hi apni friend zara jo kay andaleeb ki czn b hai usk sath completely different hai... 😏😏😒😏😒 Andaleeb jis condition mai hai us time wife ko sab sy zada apne husband ki attention chahye hoti hai but bilkul andaleeb ko neglect kar diya hai i hate numair
Hassan is becoming numair day by day and Numair is turning hassan day by day  Bhaisahab ulti ganga behh rahi 😂😂🤣
Kahin numair zara sy shadi karnay mai interested to nai 😢😮😮😅😅🤣🤣
Sharjeena k baba bhi agye aj to
Then: Numair is the ideal husband... Now: But not for me...😂
😂😂
Sehar ko har drama me achi mother in law n sister in law mil jati h 😂
Sharjeena's baba is psychiatrist then, he should have behaved in more sensible way with bechara Mostafa. 🫤😂
Bachi ka kia name rakha h samjh nhi aai moje
❤
Andaleeb has a suspicious expression! What is going on man?!
Numair is a doctor he can do Dna test of baby just by taking some hairs of baby.😂 There is no need to take the baby outside.
Nice drama
psz next part jaldi🙏🙏😢😢
numair b nafsiyati hi lgta
the best thing in drma numar offer prayer  wo apna waham bs Allah sa khta
Who else is just skipping Zara's scene
Absolute crap to get the DNA test. There is no reason to suspect the wife
Numair is trying to show his good character but is forced by human nature
Arrange marriage is scary what if he hassan and numair (kabhi soca nehi tha esa bhi din ayegi) 🙂
Yes
Dr Zara😢..apko ly k MN bohat sad oon😢😭
Zara ne sach me bataya ke Sadi ke bad life ke disition bhot moskil hute h
🤲👌👨‍👨‍👧‍👧👩‍👩‍👦😆❤❤❤❤❤😭
I learn parents bahaviour can bad effects on mind of child ❤
Lucky are those who watch this drama continuosly 😅
Mijhe numair sai kafi negative vibes arahi hai 💀💀
Mubarak ho jo andelleb ko apni behan manta ha wo khala ban gyi oor numair ko wo phuppo ban gyi 😂😂😂
Numair is igonring andaleeb but before the  baby, numair was a gentle man ! If the ability of become a father  is not present in him than i think he should do the tests not the doubt on  andaleeb ! Bro 💀
Mubarak ho bhi😂😂😂😂😂
Yaar baki sab tu theek lkn iska song alag e level ka hyy❤
@Gblovers98
I think numair liked zara😮
Godh Bharai ki rasam to yd Hy mgr talaq k bd iddat ka Bhool gye sb

Zara ne adhe drame me to 1 hi jeans pehni hai
Yes I am 🙋
this drama sounds very beautiful & different. Zara's character bohot zayada matlb zarrorat se zayada beautiful hai positive word bohot chota hai zara k character k aage
Numair agar moij ka wajah je andaleep par ungli utha raha hain to andaleep bhi zara ke wajah se ungli utha sakta hain
Why andleeb called maria API instead naumair sister name is nimra at 3:57 , 😅 anyone notice this
Zara is people pleaser
not mariya she is nimraa
Why numair is behaving like this 😢
14:24 ye tu sharjena ka bap he
Fazol rasam
😮😮😮😊😊😊😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Metal abuse is as painful as physical Abuse. Dr Numair is mentally y abusing andaleep
Now we know sarjeena k father kya kam karte hai. 😅
She doesn't want to divorce but everyone is saying she should
26:10  i like this song  Love from India
Andaleep's patience level 💯🫠
Numair ki jhaga aa kr socho to Numair galat nai hai aik banda jis k 99 % chances haun k wo father nai ban skta usy pta chly wo father ban gya hai to kia wo itna b react naa kree Numair ne phr b har situation ko bari achi tarah handle kia hai 👌
Numair ko esa ni krna chahiye
Shak ka keeda
26:33❤
Baby is so so cute 😺
Ok
Numair k character ko dekh pta chalta ha k is dunya main sabhi grey hote koi completely black ya white ni hota🩶

Numer Itna Kyon shak kar raha hai apni biwi per aisa kaisa ho sakta hai sochne wali baat hai
Aisa ku lagta ha ha k numair ki wife ki death ho jaye gi. Or doctor say shadi phir
Pait py hath na b rakhy to bacha nikl k bhag nhi jaey ga😂
Numair Hamesha apna munh q khula rakhta hai 😐
Wah Touseeq Sir AP is drama ma b 🎉❤😊
Numair is a doctor he could've easily get himself tested again.... the story is being dragged
Mawraaaa is such a powerhouse her way too naturally moving talk with the therapist is beautiful ❤

1:08
feeling so sad for zara, i can realate to her, how much mental traumas hurts, her acting is to point, her crying scenes and all, she's soo strong atleast she's trying her best to get out of her trauma😭
♥️
Respect and trust between husband and wife is so important and Numair is breaking this bond.
S

If you want to be happy, never marry a man from these four types of families, or you’ll end up hurting yourself.”  First, a family with a bad reputation Second, a family where parents intervene too much in their children’s lives, and the children can’t make their own decisions Third, a family that values material wealth and loves to flaunt for pride Fourth, a family that frequently argues and has conflicts among relatives and siblings Therefore, daughters must understand that parents, having more life experience, often have a deeper understanding of marriage and life.  It’s important to consult with them when choosing a life partner, but you must also be able to discern right from wrong, as the final decision is in your hands, and  your happiness depends on you.
All Pakistani movies life in the 1600 century,where true love does not exist They boy or girl only comprise to live together. Love after arrange marriage is not true love. This called compromise love and a down fall to divorce at the end
Dr sahab ko khud bhe therapy ke zarorat h jo os larki k sath salook kr raha hai aic condition  mai husband's  care means alot😢
7:15 i swear if this takes a bad turn and he starts liking Zara
The fact that I watched this drama just because numair was shown as a green flag
This is called arrange married where no love & no trust. Her parents destroyed both daughter life.  Always Pakistani movies are against love marriage . They made a such a scene to make the boyfriend a bad boy and a jerk.  Producers does believe in true love and love at first sight and love marriage. If you don't have a purpose or meaning to your life, chasing money will certainly be your downfall. This is why a lot of marriage and relationships doesn't work anymore because one or the other is to  busy chasing a career and money instead of being thank for what God has already done
I think, this episode is very boring 😑  Before andleep's baby
Numair you must need a therapist lol
Give me episode 26 plzz
Forget everything. ...that baby is toooooooo cute 😍😍😍
7/40 ye kaun sa fruit hai ? Plum
Numair ki beti ka nam?
❤❤❤❤
Numair ka jacket😂😂😂 9 months pregnancy k bad b garmi ni ayi😂😂😂
Lovely  drama suddenly  Numair change  his expression 😢😢
Whats wrong wtih numair ?
Who is the fan of hazrat Muhammad saw
I'm going through the same situation right now as Zara.
Mawra 🙂
Talaq rishta khtm hone ka nam h zindagi khtm hone ka nhi its nice line❤❤❤❤
Roo
Mun band kar la nai ta makhi war jani a
Sarjeena ke baba toh bank mein kaam karte the 😂
It is too scary! To leave the child with numari when he is still in doubt.
Numair it's too bad 😞
Abi exact is time kon kon dekh rha ha 🎉

Kya bakwas drama ha
Kis ne notice Kiya ke andleen ki maa jab bhi koi cheez Lene jati hai Yan Kisi ko bhulane jati hai tu andleen ke baba unhe rook lete hai
For God's sake what you people are showing us.... literally hr dosray teesray dramay main yehi dikhaya ja Raha hai k larkay ko doubt hai k honay wala bacha uska hai bhi ya nhi mtlb Astagfirullah kia mtlb hai in baton ka....Tum hi hoty ho apni wife k sath or kon kry ga mtlb HDD hai.....I am not criticizing Numair's character he is really a gem jis trhan us ny namaz main ALLAH se Dua ki that was an amazing one...likin baqi dramon ka kia kaam hai is trhan ki chezon ko provoke krny ka???
Slowly i dislike Numair's character in each scene
जय श्रीराम सभी को ❤
Numair is concern for Zara more than his wife!
Incredible contribution in creating awareness about importance of  meantal health and councling .
Yeah I am india
Yes I'm Indian ❤🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Itna jaldi bacha ho gya 😂😂 India mai toh abhi time lagta😂

Everyone need therapist in this drama😢
What even happened to numair? Can someone explain....?
Mujhay dedo baby tumlog apas ma larro
Amazing episode 👏 the way Zara is dealing with her trauma phase is really commendable 👌🤘🙋🏻‍♀️, she is a strong person i know she will definitely come out of this tough situation & by the time every pain will be healed 🙂👍. Numair ney Andaleeb pr shaq kr k achha ni kiya , baby ka DNA test 🙄this was really heart breking 💔 feeling bad for Andaleeb 🥺.
Numair b syco hogya
Numair khud nafsiyati mareez hai
Numair to accha ha lekin writer accha nhi hain ye kya twist hai bhai ache kase drama kharab kar rahe or zara ka happy ending kar na plzz😭
Ye itna shock q ho gyi 😂😂😂
Ye kaya fzool hidon  ki rasam dekha rhy hain kaya sekha rhy hain ap muslamno ko ye hmary deen ka hisa nhi ha good bhrai krna khudra kuch khyal kr liya kryn writers😢😢😢
Only salam is said to each other but no one answers with waalaikum assalam 🤷‍♀️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So nice❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Numair ko dekhkr bohot dar lagrhahe.
I love you jafa tema

Doctor numair de km waikh lo
Aur tablets khae andaleeb ishq me shadi k pehle hi DN. Ishq Ka bhoot sawar tha us waqt isk ser pe, Apne parents ki Izat I b parwa na ki thi. Jab apni ankho SE us larke Ka real face Dekha to ye peche hati thi, otherwise ye numair k sath kbi na rehti...
Nice serial ❤❤❤❤

Numair is now in hassan's side
zara ki maa ziada masoom na banay kbhum asa nahen chahty thay bar bar alag hony ka mashwara day kr masoom bn rahi hain beti ka ghr tabah kr dia...insan ghalti ko sudhar lay to muaaf krvdena chahea mgr had hy
seems like numair ko jitni praisal mili thi utni hi gaaliya padhegi till the end
Zaram's story is enough to make easy to heal our teenagers
Vote for two episodes in a one week ☝️
Now I get to know that Sharjeena's father is a therapist.. 😂😂

Well I think numair also needs a therapy
Numair ko therapist ki need hai, more than zara
BTW ye pehla comment section dekha ha jis ma drama k baary ma hi comments hn 😂😂
Nice 😊
Wow Numair i didn't expected that  From green green flag to red Changing colours like chameleons.
Iss drama main sary hee mentally disturbed characters hain kia. Phly Hasan phir oss ke wife ab dr numair beee
Fazool rasoomat ko promote karnay ke zaroorat kia hai jinka hamaray deen se bhi koi taluq nahi
Andaleeb k last seen k face expression sy to asa hi lg rha ha jesy numair ka shk bilkul sai ha
I am an Indian but it's my favourite series ❤

I feel very bad of Zara appi who is with me 😢
Kurang enk nontonnya semenjak numair gk percaya istrinya...😢😮😢
Mawra just slayed this character!! Her expressions are just🔥🔥🔥

Boring lag raha hain aab ye drama🙂🙂!!  Andelip sare pregnancy mein thoda support nehi payi uski husbnd se... Even numair bacche ko dekhi lekin akbr andelip ko dekha bhi nehi,  kaise hain haal puchna to dur
Bhai AP yeha hum ko Kya delha Raha ha Kya Huma PATA nhi bacha kesa hota ha wtf bro 😂😅
Mujhe lagta he numair jara ko pasand karta he isiliye to apne bibi ke sath khush nehi rehta
Yeh bayhooda rasam kis Muslim household may hoti hay?? Bidaati director!
I am  indian 🥰😍 we love to watch pakistani drama 🥰
Andaleebs last reaction looks like it's moizs child
Dna test karlo beta
Zoned out Numair during goad bharai. So saddening😢 just because of doubt he has about her wife's loyalty. So sad!!😢 shakk kills your happiness.
Hm bhi Indian 🥰🙋💫
Numair the Bangladesh flag😂
Es drama mai sab ko khyn na khyn psycatrist ki zarorat hsi😂
Naumair being a doctor behaves like psycho😊😊
Numair holding Manto's book
I just hate how  numair is changing himself because of baby😢
Numair also needs a therapist
Any Bangladeshi here ?? 🇧🇩
Jab therapist ny kaha na jo bhi hy dil mein zara keh do i smile that time aesa to kabhi es husband ny bhi nahi kaha
Anyone from Kashmir 🍁
Gardening is the best  therapy beta with my experience the doctor is correct
How cute
Any Nepali here 🇳🇵♥️🌷
Pehli bar pakistan drama me kiss liye hain 😅 but Accha laga ❤❤
I don’t understand why Andaleeb start following Numair. They have good relationship, she should just have called Numair and asked him where is he taking the baby rather following him. Bad script.
Shrm aati h mujhe ab numair pe uski nature mujhe psnd nhi aane lagi
❤❤
ي سب  بدا هي  الله اب سب كو هدايتدي
Numair doctor hokr aisa sochta h 😢
3:56 nimrah ya mariya😂
Zara ki acting ❤❤❤
Itna late kuu 😢
Numair kaisa behaviour karne laga h na khayal rakhta hai na hi achhe se bat karta hai
Favorite drama ❤ever iska w8 Krti hu or buhut ❤khushi oti e ❤ can't express my happiness 😊
Numair's character is very bad now, how can he think negatively about his wife? So dumb 👎
Today I came to know the job of Sharjeenas father
Who love  India se he like karke bataiye please ❤
😂😂namair mirror me skl mila rha hy😅😅😅
Sehar, do not accept role which has child bearing. You are too young to do do this role.
Zara is right ..divorce is hard in any case
Zara's therapist session❤ is far better than hasan's
The way zara is handling trauma is very mature
14:24 sharjeena father is a therapist. Kabhi main Kabhi Tum
Numair, u should b thanking Allah for giving u such a wonderful gift instead of having doubts. Andaleeb's an honest n clear headed person. She's like an open book
❤❤❤❤❤❤ India se bahut Achcha drama hai Hasan ka roll bhi bahut Achcha hai uski Dadi bhi bahut acchi hai❤❤❤❤❤❤
Apna sth la javo 😅Mujhe v shadi krni ha yrr gar wala khta ha tum abi chotti ho 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is Andaleeb holding her stomach? In this age, educated girls know the baby will not be delivered before it’s time , therefore no need to hold the tummy
Yes
Itna misunderstanding created na karo 😢😢😢😢
Andleep Mera bad pregnant hoi thi onki baby duniya ma b a gay or Mera 32 weeks howa abhi 😢
Dr.Numair aap paternity test bhi toh kara sakte they Dr ho aur ye bhi nai pata?!🥲
Ma India sa hu lakin my Favorite show❤
Sharjeena k papa yha aa gye ❤
Indian hazir hojaye 🎉🥳🥳🥳❤️
Numair aik doctor hai test doobara karwaskta hai confusion door hojayegi iski
Fun fact when numair is praying his dress is always black😂
cant numair do DNA test
Plz yrr na kro eda andleeb is right  numair da character thoda jeha shi krdiyo agle episode ch oh atleast avdi wife te bhrosa rkhe ❤❤❤
34:00 seen was amazing ❤❤ good team Hard work
Numair's having doubts whereas doesn't he know, miracles do happen. Allah is Greater...
S❤❤❤t❤
بہانے سے بچی کو رکھ رہا ھے اس کا ی این اے کرانے جاۓ گا
Zara jes halat say guzar Rahe ha same Mari ASI halat ha mari
Kisise notice kiya sharjeena na ke father yaha aagaye😅
Anyone from nepal 🇳🇵 ❤
I am 😊Indian 😊
Hayee sharjeena ke abba dikh gaye
Mujhe bahut hairani hoti hoon yeh soch kr k numair or Zara ka nikah kyon nhi hua dono family ek dusre ko jante the ache dost the same hospital tha achi zindgi Gujar jani thi
Numair is so wrong. He is showing so much care to Zara but what about his wife, what he is doing with her unfair totally.
Y use Hindi words when our language is so beautiful
Watching zara expressing her emotions about divorce feels so relatable as I'm going through the same pain rn... Its NEVER easy even if its your choice. But living alone and getting rid of such toxic husband is better than suffering every day. Felt so relieved listening to her convo with the therapist. I am a doctor myself and dealt with the same situation for about 2 years. Whoever reads this comment, please remember me in your prayers.
Ye episode dekhne ke liye mai 7 din ka wait karna padta hai
9 : 18 this is very old fashion to keep hand on belly
Numair is so scarry 30:40 😮😮😢
so natural way of zara expressing her pain she is going through....great actress
Zara's acting mind blowing wonder full and also numair and deebu😊😊
Why doesn't she feel disappointed that instead she was scared😂. Something is fishy??? 😮
Kitna slow move ho raha hai yaar yeh drama
How can a little baby used to experimenting
21:45
Who is from Delhi?
Numair has all the rights to shock her, why is dna test so scary?
Numair 11:47  zara ki sadness dekh skta hai !!??? Andleebb ki ni dekhi jari ???? She is not wrong anywhere!! Agr numair ko problem hai bi toh baat kree na !🙂‍↔️🤷‍♀️
Go do dna
Yea nhi ho ta aap ka bacha aap ka jise ho ga
Any Nepali here??🇳🇵❤
DNA test karlo Numair Bhai🙏🏻
This show is only showing 1 a week why?
Sehar Khan ke fan ho jaye taiyar unka new serial tan man nilo nil aayega ❤❤❤❤❤
Ab ye drama boring lagne laga hai
Numair confused expressions with baby in front of mirror...badhiya tha....
I hate numair🤬
Loving the transformation of Andleeb from a school girl to a caring mother.
Who is here after iqtidar
Sab Indian hi hain itni population Kahan hai pakistan ki jitne view dikh rahe hain is ler
Is this ritual allowed Muslim culture? Absolutely not, Hindu community follows this rule according to their belief, don't why Pakistani dramas promote such things which has no ground for Muslims
😅😅😊😊
Numair phle itna ideal shogar lgta tha but ab he has changed. Pregnant bv se zda zara ki fikr pari hoi hai. Usko care de raha hai andleep ko care muhabbat ki zururt hai uska ehsas ni. Psycho ban raha hai ab hasan ki trh.
Kmeena
Masha'ALLAH cute Baby
India present™
کتنا سوچوں کہ محبت نہیں کرنی میں نے ___ پھر یہ سوچوں ہائے کیا تجھ سے بھی نہیں؟
آپ مجھے اچھے لگے کیوں لگے کیسے لگے اب یہ معاملہ کن فیکون کا لگتا ہے
Ye to hum he jane
Jaraaa ki acting ❤️‍🔥🎀
Is zara Sanam Teri Kasam heroine???
I am in love with mawra eyes
I think what is the history of the pen🤔
Yes
Thank God now numair is happy 🎉❤
Masyallah...the baby is soo adorable❤❤❤❤
its true...an idle mind is the workshop of the devil....the devil always whispers doubt into our minds....
the male psychiatrist is so composed as he was Sharjeenas father11111111
Mistakes,,,zara ki mother ka dupatta doo sides... Camera k nazdeeq se aur camera ke dur se
Any Bangladeshi here?

Godd bharai is a HINDU CUSTOM HINDUISM haai In ISLAM there is nothing such a culture or Customs, INDIAN Serials ke NAKLI zaruri haa kya?

I hope happy ending ho 🥲
Numair ny dhokay sy shadi ki phr dna tk krwa rha. He don't deserve partner
31:37   Baby ko deko kase mirror dekh rhi hai kesi kesi shakalay bna rhi hai sai kaha larkiyaan 😂😂😂
Andleeb mar jaygi baby K liye zara numair ki shadi
Who noticed deebu announced her nand name maria instead of nimra😝
All dramas best on Hum tv 😁😁😁😎😎😎🤯🤯
3:57 maria? 😂😂
The way zara is working towards her healing process is commendable.  Nothing will happen on its own. I hope  she  finds her new journey.
Dibo ka baby bump bht funy lg rha tha😂😂😂
If you think its not yours go for DNA you’re a doctor-you should know that. Stupid drama
Somehow, I feel that Andaleep and Numair  are a mismatch even without any toxicity.
Yaar sab log bagil hain hum bi bagil kerenge 😮😮😮
Any   one is from. Italy??
Numair married with Zara
Hindowana rasmey promote kerna tou hum tv pe farz hei.
I am funny
Week me ek eoisode wo bhe just 35 minutes ki😢 and drama tw aese bhaag rhi jese next last episode hogi😂 baby b hogaya nam bhe rkh diya aesa lg rha beech me sy kuch missing parta hain😮
Shame on writers, ek pakistani muslim muashray men kya ghalazat dikha rahay hain, woh bhi numair jaisay banday say.
Sharjeena ke papa ap yaha kaise?? Wish he was this considerate in mustafa’s case as well. 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Bot acha howa andlerp ko numair ki asal okat pata chali
No
Namair ko pakro 4 thapper raseed karo aur drama khatam karo
26:35
Numair should marry Zara both mature n compliment each other
Nomair doing cheap act  towards Andleeb but Andleebs face expiration showing that something is wrong...
Mawra doing super good work 👏
Yh god bhrai pakistan mn kb ae?
Numair mozze
Outclasss performance by mawra😍👏👌
Isnt Numair's sister's name Nimra?.. bcz today andaleeb called her Maria 😅

There are so many comments justifying numair. No he is not justified at all. At first he didn't tell andaleeb that he can't be a father he just told her he didn't want children. He still didn't tell her when they decided to continue their marriage and then he didn't inform anyone about his doubts and insecurities. He has the time and capacity to seek help instead of giving free therapies to others and just praying and crying in vain, that doesn't help no really i mean it only crying doesn't help you to get out of your mental unstableness. And also the fact that he would've married Zara if he wasn't infertile pisses me off
Kah denay say sab halka hojata hai
Zara n her therapist stole the show today
Debo maria API bolti Hy or bebo ki sass nimra Kia name Hy nand ka
Hi. I m. Zainab
Numair unpar mardo ki trhan q treat krrha hai. Wo ek Dr hai agr usay doubt h to ek bar phr APNA test krwa kr confirm kr Lena chaye... na k wo bv pr shak kray .... Intihai bura lg rha hai numair
Numair is a cheater at first he hid the fact about his infertility and then kept secret that he is mentally unstable. He has the time to take counselling instead of praying and crying. If he wasn't infertile he would've married Zara for sure
❤❤❤
In deebu numair track the writer is very 90s coded while on the other track is very progressive
Numair character is good friend terrible husband
Han bhai Zahra bhhoooooooooot bary toofan Sy takeai hai ....ufff ...wo 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What is godh bharai?  I've never known it to be a pakistani or Islamic tradition?   I used to see it in Indian dramas long time ago...
Numair bhai ye moo khula rakhne wali acting mat karen, open mouth absent minded sa expressions, kya convey krna chah rahay hen, bht betukka lagta he.
نمير غبي لو عمل لئلو تحاليل كان عرف انو هاي بنتو
The moment when she hear about DNA test why is she with that expression,she seems shocked and scared
Last episode kb awe gi faltu hoga hy
Karwa ly dna test
Is this therapist therapy and alll real  Do they listen advice without judging and keeping secret
Nooo please don't ruined numair's personality nd his gentleman behaviour to give him doubts 😢😢
vote for 2 episodes every week
I think it's not a big deal if one of them wants to check he has the reason thats why he doubting his health and deebo he has right but he's scarred of results and he cares so much for deebo he scarred that deebo might get sad or angry, overthink that he's doubting his wife and thats why he's struggling inside of his brain the promo says it all and everyone have nafs so it's normal for humans but he's still keeping his trust on اللہ and continue to smile everyday his mental health Distorted but still he carry himself as normal as much he can agr koi or mard hota to ye talak tk chali jati bat pr is drama ka maqsad hi yehi k how should humans male and female make themselves a better life partner and carry those burdens ups and downs with patience and positive mind if one of them gets hyper than other one should remain be silent it goes for both partners such people like numair and zara is rarely exist in our society
Numair looks little suspicious to me. Sometimes I have a feeling that he likes Zara. Who agree with me?
Sharjeena’s dad came here
Where are andleeb parents  Delivery time.
Deebo pr pregnancy bilkul bh achi nh lg rhi..who agreed
I am from islamabad  Ye drama  Urgnt tina park ma shoot  Aj ki episode ma dna hsptl ma jo gaye Wo medicsi hai islamabad ka hosptl topest
Another western and Indian rusum we Muslims we Pakistanies are following baby shower gawd burr ay are we Pakistani Muslims going to leave any non Muslim russums hum nay hor kithna gorra or hor kithna Indian honna hay
Women has to prove her virginity and purity. Disgusting . He has been sleeping with her hopefully and the liar did not tell his suitors that he cannot have any kids . He just told andaleep that he doesn’t want any kids . What a liar.
Excellent acting by zara
Numair did so wrong he need therapist both zara and deebu feeling sad for them both husbands r mental 😂😂😂 who agree
Numair ko bas zara ka taqlif dikhai deta h andaleeb k uper dhayan hi ni deta h 😡😞
Phir se moeez.. Another red flag
Sharjeena k Abba idr Kya kr rhy hain😂
Doctor hote huwe numair ko ye pta k DNA krwane k liye bachi ko le kr Jana zrori ni tha😂😂 sample bhi le kr ja skta tha..
Pehle itna bharosa kiya or ab utna hi shakki ho gaya numair
Why is numair behaving like psychopath ahsan 😭😭
Zara ko dekh ker afsoos hota hai. Kase aik mental husband aik perhi likhi larki zindagi barbad ker deta hai chahe wo jitni marzi hai perhi likhi ho aur khud ko busy rakhe still insaan yeh sab nahi bhool sekta
This is a very good thing to show in the drama that after divorce or breakup it’s normal to get therapy. Therapy is for healing your mental health. Unfortunately pakistanis dont consider therapy after breakup or divorce and they keep hurting other people in their lives.
😢the transformation of Numair is so scary
Ab numair Hassan aur Hassan numair ban jaye ga😂
20:25 such a shakkeee person. How he could nomair think of such negative about the character of his wofe
Always fvrte drma and fvt numair seher mawra❤
Parai orat say itni humdardi or apni masoom c bachi bv ko ignor kr rahay ho bhai tm ksm say boht boray ho tm ...
Shukar hai Allah ka
As zara portray the depression after divorce, she just nailed it...
26:38❤
Zara seriously nailed it.. i really can't believe Mawra can act as good as she is doing in this drama.
any sri Lankan here? 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
I'm in the exact same position as Zara but instead of physical abuse, I was the victim of psychological/emotional/narcissistic abuse in my marriage, which is in some ways even worse because you don't recognize it initially and the abuser manipulates you to ensnare you in their guilt trap where everything is your fault, and nothing is their fault or responsibility. Everything Zara is saying and feeling, I feel the exact same way, especially because I am also an overachieving doctor who finds failure hard to accept. Divorce was necessary otherwise I would've disappeared into a shadow of the person I was, perhaps stop existing all together, but divorce still feels like you failed, like you did something wrong, like you're being punished for something. You want to bury all the pain in yourself and pretend to be happy, you want to spare everyone the harshness of what has happened to you, but those who love you can see the damage. For anyone suffering through this, please get help with therapy. Not everyone is lucky to have a supportive family. Always remind yourself that NO ONE deserves abuse of any form. May Allah SWT relieve us of the pain and suffering, and reward our patience.
Numair py Hassan ka asar araha haii..😂
Maria api ky 2 bachy hain ?? Her name is nimra
Zara is 💯 right when she said "reasons kitny bhi real Hon koi nhi chahta ke us ka ghr tooty
Numair khud doctor Hai. Apna Chekup Q nae Kara lete k e bacha os ka Hai yai naa
Yr numair... DNA test karle bhai😒...ye tamasha khatam kar🤬
Es dramy k dnu hero pschoo dekhayee hy. Numair aur andaleeb couple ko tu khush khush dekhaty.... V slow nd sad type drama
Maria Api😮 yeh Nimra 25 Epi to Maria kese hogai😂😂
Hindu rasms
دعا کے نیچے آمین کرتے ہوے جاو۔اللہ میرے لیے اسانی مقدر فرماے۔ہر معاملہ میں۔
That's good. Their is nothing wrong in getting the DNA test done. I think he took a wise decision. Making 3 lives suffer isnt good
Very disappointed after watching today's episode. After having the baby went for DNA test. Numair's chance of becoming a father was 1%. But he went a step further, doubting his wife's character and went for a DNA test. If Hasan is a red flag, then Numair is no less.
i cant watch it anymore
Zara ki mother ka dupatta kbhi gale mkabhi god m 😂😂
her khishi ka kismoth may peyer nehi hothi hey..
Did he sign the divorce paper ?
I cried out too when zara cried in front of her physicratist by being mental trauma depression after n divorce...bcz divorce words its too easy to say but it holds very much of baggage of being traumatize in very ugly relationship of husband n wife...
Numair zara  ke baare me bhuth soch rahe he  andalif ke baare me chod kar
Common sense khud doctor hai itna rone ki kya zarorat  again test krwa le doctor hai koi  dhoobi nhe 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
This episode seems so rushed. And with lots of bloopers. But lets appreciate that they are highlighting mental health problems
Farah mawra ki bari Behan LG rhi h maa nh
Im
Comparing his own daughter to himself😮😅 don't know what to say?😢😢 31:28
Ye episode me to ek chiz gour se dekhe jab andleep ke yaha sab mehaman aaye the to budhi log matlb numair ki maa,andleep ki maa, or zara ki maa ka eye 👁️ brow 😛 gajab ka parlour de banwayi 😂😂😅😅bap re bap budhi log ka 😅😅😅
Hypocracy of audience is so visible. If a girl doubts, its ok she has misunderstanding but if a man doubts,  he is a red flag🙄
The director should have shown Zara petting a cat instead of a dog,because dog spit is impure
Ye goad Bharai k rasam Yahan to nahi hoti
Now this drama is getting idiotic with Numair’s weird track…
when will pakistani dramas stop endorsing baseless non-Islamic traditions and cultures
Ye rasmeim Islam ki rasmein nhi hain ye hindu’s ki rasoomat hain to please in rasmon ko mat apnao 🙄 hamary Islam mein to har cheez pardy mein hi rkhny ga hukam hai
All the people saying that nunair is hurting andaleeb and all that ... " He's just confused and unstable becise of his past test reports which says that he can't be father in future so that's why he's getting confused and negative thoughts are gathering him "  Its my point of view 😃🙂‍↔️
Zara is best in expressing psychological handling of trauma
aik inky ye ghar kitnay pyary hai😂
اگر اپ اسی سوچ میں کمنٹ پڑھتے ہو کہ یہاں پہ لڑکیاں ہیں لیکن وہ اپ کو گھاس نہیں ڈالے گی😂
سارے کمنٹ میں نے پڑھ لی ہیں نیچے جانے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے😂😂😂

I don't know why but I think this drama is going to end sooner 😢😂❤
Anadil
Bor kr dia hy drama plz bs kr dain kharab na karo dramy ka charm boht boring thi ye episode
Kitny students ya drama dakh rhy han
Usko kistarah mushwara de raha he tumhe khud bhi is ki zaroorat he
Yes
I admire the fact that this drama is breaking down stigma attached to so many issues like therapy, DNA tests, counseling, male-female friendships, husband not constantly suspecting his wife of cheating/staying in contact with her ex, an ex who’s only goal in life is to break up his gf’s marriage, trying to create differences, etc. Kudos to writers for being progressive about such issues every person faces in our typical conservative society.
Mard ik jese hoty 😂
Kesi behuda rasam hai sharam to bilkul e khtm kardi gai hai dramo me se bap k samne beti ki god bharai horai 😢
Mawra what a beautiful actor bhot achi tarha define kia apne apko..or ayse he log apne apko samjhte ha jb koi Chala jata ha breakup hota h
Mariya appi kai 2 bacche hai 😂😂😂😂😂
Maria Api😂Saas ko api bana dia Deebu ne😂
Numair is a educated n sensible person oer itni aqal nhi k apna test krwale bal k bv pe shak kiyay ja ra hy ulty waswasy pal ra hh
6:50 hindonon key rasmain. Please don't propagate biddaat
Isi lye khty hn k mard  dun k dil s baten ni nklti numair ne is bt ka dabot dedia
Mard Kitna bh acha ho but fitrat ni bdal skti shuk to wo krta hi h chae numair ho Yan koi or
Nuamir also need therapist.. Everyone need therapist in this drama.. Both dad's debu's parents zara and hassan Everyone need therapist... Everyone in this world has need therapist..
Yeh rasam islam mn haram ha aur usko dramas mn promote Kiya ja Raha ha?😢
Numair now🤡
Numair also need therapist
The baby was the best part of this episode❤❤ super cute!
OMG! THE MOMENT WHEN NUMAIR KISSED ANDALEEB'S FOREHEAD.♥️😭🫶🏻
Poor Andaleep
Pakistani darma m ye sb touching or pregnant bana kr pet wet nikal dena ye to nhi tha pehle q ase kr. Rhe
What's wrong with Numair kbhi khul ke nhi haste dekha abhi tk itne sare episodes dekh liye bs ek khisyani si muskurahat aati hai face pr 😠😠
Frst hasan needed psychiatrist now zara is going to a therapist and now Numair should also go to therapist
35:01 yehi hota hai koi mard past affair ko nahi bhoolta hence it is proved
Numair is becoming Hassan day by day😂😢
Zulfein 26:38  bandh dia karein aurat ko bachay k bad apna hosh nahi hota inlogo k bal khule rehte hain
Ab numair ko bhi trophist k jana chaye .zara to chali gai he ..lagta he Hassan apna rang chorgya he sab pe.  hassan ne acha badla lya he in sab se 😊
I think we should eliminate these fazool extra rasmein like “goad barhai” as this is just waste of money and time.We should be happy for the coming baby we can celebrate it by reciting Quran and do prayers for baby and parents instead.
Moiz mamu ko invite nh kiya??😂😂
Numair b to hospital he jata usay maa hospital anay ka he keh rhe thi
Wana husband like numair vali kidher han😂😂😂😂
Andaleeb ne nimra aapi k bajaye mariya aapi kaha😂
Baby ka name kya hai??
Zara acting , superb 🎉
Getting lame without any sense
Yes numair is like hassan bas farak itna hey wo baby chahta tha ye nahi
Why why why godh bhrai ki rsm dikhany ka Kya mqsd hy logun k dmagh phly he asman py hyn kyun new fzool rsm un ki Zindagi ka hissa bnany py Tul gy hyn ap log plz stop promoting nonsense and unnecessary rituals
Numair doing mentally torture andaleb. And mentally torture is dangerous than physical torture. So numair needs also therapist
Matlab ek Hasan ko thik karte karte Zara pagal hogyi. Bechari ko treatment leni par rahi hai. Ab Numair or uska harkate Andaleeb ko vi mentally weak kar denge. Har koi dimagi mariz banke ghum rahi hai yha🤦‍♀️
Numair part is so frustrating.. he is a doctor he should be practical
India wale attendance ❤👍🏻
Aray Maria nahii Nimra hai 😀
Numail ne Andleeb ko dhoka dia hai uss say bat chupa k. Andleeb ne uss say kuch ni chupaya
Oh my God. Itne bore tariqe se numair ka sach samne aya 😮😮
Any Nepali Here? 🇳🇵
At the end of this drama NUMAIR 's become zara"s husband and  Andleep is alone no one is with her  Becaise  Numair cheated on Andleep and she takes divorce from Numair.....
Itna twist hea kio???
Phle to nimra naam tha nand k ab mariya😂
Namasty gyz
First time i witness such thing baby was born in merely in 21 minutes.
Mawra ki movie " Sanam Teri Kasam"kis kis ko pasand hai ...❤
Sare psycho bante ja rahe h. 😅😅🙃🙃
Dont blame Numair. He  is really a gentleman.  He himself  going  through a trauma  of mental condition.  Yet, He is trying all his level best to behave normally.
17:33 please use glycerine to show tears in zara's eyes.she has no tears but she wipes off face😂
apnii biwi ko hamesha zehni mareez bna kr rakhny waly mard bahir ki aurton k liye kitny protective, caring, understanding bn jaty aurr ghrr bethi biwi pagal hoti rehtii day by day
guys plz support kr do
How beautifully this daram is showing so many things. This drama deserves good popularity.
He act like a pious but he does not believe in Almighty Allah's power.
Oh wow never thought murtaza uncle would come
Today is my birthday still no like 😢😢

Numair behavior is weird... Itna bara Dr hai agr shak horha hai to phir se apny test krwa le
Yesss
Baby Kitna cute hai.🥰🥰
Ye zara ki iddat ka process missing kyun hai?
Anyone who wants to do online work??
Lagta hai is drama me Sabko therapist ki jarurat padegi
Ye hai pe Ayesha naam ki ladkiya kon hai jo hai woh comment mai yes likha
What an episode!!! The best one so far in terms of pace and direction!!! 👏🏼Mindblowing acting by Usman!!!
কে কে বাংলাদেশ থেকে দেখছেন?
About story.. it's just bla bla bla... but thee best dialogue in this episode was at 1:40
Total crap! His baseless doubt is ridiculous, being a doctor, its not even practical to think that
I know it's wrong but i like numair and zara as a couple. Both has soothing vibe ❤
Next Friday kaab hein!!!!❤
31:37 The way Numair is trying to match his face with his baby is hilarious 😂
Kia naam rakha hay bachi ka?
If Numair knew that he cant be a father .This is cheating that he married andaleeb without her and her parents knowing of it.
Yh sirf friday ko hi aata h ?
Thank you for bringing in intrusive thiughts and going into therapy for getting out of trauma ❤❤❤.
❤
zara ny iddat nai ki
Numair ke expression like over acting
Numair is Bangladeshi Flag.😂
Nimra api se Maria api kb ho gyi
What am I watching? Kahin Deep Jalay or Jaafaa?😮
Yes iam indian
Understanding each other is very important in a relationship. None can live in peace after being mentally and physically abused
Numair ko zara se sadi krni thi sayd kuki iska muh iske liye hi khulta h
Khamkha drag kr rehy
Sharjeena da bspu therapist aa😂
Ha toh itna saak hai to DNA kyu nehi karwa lete...😏😏
What a lame therapist 😂
U don't need to carry the baby for DNA test..just a strand of hair is enough..they r representing a doctor base drama and missing out these details..how stupid😂
Abhi bohot boar kar raheb ye log😢
Yeh sharjeena ka baap yahan kya krra h 😒
Numair acts like a stranger towards his own wife and acts as if he didnt play any part in getting her pregnant 😂😂😂
Kis kis ko lagta hai ki numair zara ko like karta hai😂😂
Baaki sab chalta rahegi.... Lekin sharjeena baaji k abba ki job iss drama mein pata lagi🤌
Numair  ka walk thoda thoda advani ke bete jaisa lgta hai😅
Every man has syco problem
Nomair is becoming abnormal by not giving time to his wife..
shirjeena's dad 😮
31:36😂😂😂
At  deebu ki rasam m zaraa nh ayi zbrdast 👌
Numair kaise kaise face expression deta hai
Lagta hai ab ye love story triangle shape le rahi hai...😐 phir ye drama goes too much bakwas...!!
Faltu rasam
Number is becoming  Hasan day by day
Nomair needs to go to a therapist himself, instead of asking Zara to do it!  Such a dual personality!
asil kirdar to zara kar rahi h
Numair resorts to prayers --- excellent --- talking through personal experience, prayers help A LOT in every hard situation in life, but he needs therapy as well!  Also, Mawra's outdone herself --- & her good girl conditioning upon people benefitting from her tree-like self's shade... My oh my 🙌💖🥺
Any Indian here??
The drama portrays two types of abuse ; mental and physical, for Zara and andaleeb respectively. Both kill you from within.
Jahilo ne drama interesting banake middle me ganda sa topic daal dete hain...
Ab aye ga toofan
numeir ki fazool acting
Tauseeq Haider is back... Who is from 90's... Morning show host
depo ka kirdar bt  acha h🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Dog is najas
Maria aapi??? Nomair ki behn ka Naam to nimra hai na 🤔
Why do I have a feeling nomair's going to marry zara
How can he even think  ye iska bacha nahi hai very sad
The character of Zara is just very well written and Mawra did it fantastically👏 watch drama only for Zara❤
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
itna confuse ho raha hai, apna checkup dobara krwa ly!😂 no point of worry of numair.
what a story.........
Omg numair ne hassan se ziada bura kia andlib k sath
Zabrdust drama
There are all pakistani here
I don't know but I also thought maybe from today's episode the beginning of Zara and Numair story but if Zara become third wheel then Zara's charcter will lose their appreciation which people are giving to zara and Numair become red flag
sab hi nafsiyati ho gaye hain😂😂🎉
21:13  baby is so adorable 😍
Zara ko debu ki buddua lag gi
Andaleeb is not ignored. Her husband is dealing with his own inner emotions regarding the baby . Talking to his friend Zara was so adorable. Only good and sincere friends share that bond .
3:57 Yeh Maria aapi kon hai? 😂 Nimra hai Numair ki behen ka naam. 5:20 Deebu ki mom uski saas ko Maria keh ke pukar rhe hai.  Inki pehle koi script seedhi kre, jo inko naam pata chale.
Wheres all those people who predicted Anadleeps got cancer
Nobody against this Hinduoana ritual I think actually dramas promoting these nonsense
Medical test is not 100% and temporary. Like blood sugar...it may go up or down. Sometimes fertile, sometimes infertile. It is ALL in ALLAH's hands. My-X was infertile for 11 years. Tests proved by 2-3 docs locally and internationally that he was azoospermia. BUT after our divorce...he fathered 3 kids with his new wife. HOW is that possible?? Can anyone throw light??
❤ I am amazed by Mawra's acting in this. And very well shown Numair character doesn't matter what a man says he will never be okay with his wife relations with any other men, no one is that "GREEN" flag.
There is no way andaleeb will be able to see numair the same way again
How is no one talking about Mawra's acting!? She has honestly outdone herself in this drama!! Perfect expressions and acting!! 👏👏👏👏
I really loved today's episode!  Numair ki andar ki baat bhi reveal ho jaye ga sab kuch clear![btw I'm not  criticizing anyone’s character, just telling the fact]  Specially loved that part Zara is consulting therapist, trying to recover! 28:49 I loved her look, that sunglasses really suit on her
Come on dear numair what's going on in his mind his behavior is changed by momentarily
Any Nepali here??
This drama is going to be end soon ❣️❣️
31:11 reel or reality m bht bda frk h usko Dr ne kaha wo kbhi bap ni ban skta frr bhi wo khamosh h...y reel h... Or reality m ab tk mar pit alg or bina jane bina soche devorce wo alg🥲😅
wtf is this rasam definitely not a part off Pakistani / islamic culture
Dr Numair and his mood swings! He needs therapy like anything 😅.  The way he was holding the baby when Deebu left I was so scared. He looked as if he's going to harm her 😢
34:37 how beautiful the salwar suit isssss❤❤❤❤❤❤
Promot Indian culture goad bharayii
good therapist in drama😅 well-done
Maria aapi nahi nimra api😁😁😁😁
I think numair loves Zara....
Ye sharjeena ke Abba yaha psychiatrist bn gye😅😅 aur ye kaise therapist hai jo chai coffee ke sath treat krte apne patients ko😂😂😂😂 and ye numair... Iske to mood swings hi khtm ni hote😅😅 ab pol khulegi iski😅😅
😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Numair is the best man
3 .56 andleeb ne sahi hi  kaha hai ... usne kaha maria abbi ke 2 bache hai mtlb nimra or nurmair
Ek pagol thik hoite na hoite rekta pagol hoi jacce..ki ek drama
Bohat hi ajeeb bat hay shuru mein itny khuly zehan ka bnda asy kesy ho sakta hay saeki bnda aik hi kafi tha es dramy mein
Hindu rasmon ko na promote karen plz...hamare drame in k.begher b bht ache hn aur society pe asar dalte hn so plz dont promote such things
Ye sab krny sy behtr tha apny test krwa leta
16:17 all eldest daughters can feel this 😀
Ye pen wali knsii new story start ho gi h?
Numair is sure that this child is not mine  Because the doctor said you can't be a dad  Now he will become a villain for his wife.
Hi  guys 😂
Any "Sanam teri kasam" Fan here just for Mawra❤
Are dr sahab , itnaa issus ho rah hai to DNA test karwa lo 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Any Bangladeshi here?
Mustafa se jake kuch sikho tum log(hasan,numair)...wibi ko kaise treat korte hen...acha drama ko barbad lar rehe ho kyun..ye numair apni wibi ko chodke apni friend ko jyada important deta hai
Any Malayali here
Yeah godbharai ki rasm kub se muslims families mein aa ghai....???
mistake nikal aiii andaleeb ne maria api keh dia nimra ko........
At this point of time, this drama is the most sensible and sensitively made...rest is just fillers regardless how expensively made...
Good thing is that mawra parents gave their daughter an excellent education for standing in her own way
Why numair why 😢Maine Kitna tariff Kiya thaa tumhara 🥺plz don't continue it
Are sharjeena ke papa to zahra ko counseling session dene aaye h 😂😂😂
When Numair raise her hand in prayer and start crying 😅... Iss pehli such main meri samaj ki bahar hai🙂
they literally ruined numair's character
Doctor hai aur doubt me bachhe ka d.n.a test kra le kaisa pakistani drama hai 😅😅 gajab haal hai
Meri ami shi bolti h ese chup rhene wale ladke bhut khatrnak hote h
Ye kia bakwas rasam hai not islamic hindu rasam hai band karo ye bakwas
Mene suna tha doctors padh padh k pagal hote .ab dekh b li
Maybe Dr. Zara is his first love😂
From Bangladesh
Dr numair ka muh hamesha q khula hua h0ta hai 😂😂😂😂
Yar koi esy bataye ke pet Se bacha gir nhi jata  Hath he nhi Chor Raha hai pet se
Yes
3:58 scene m Kisi ny Kuch note kiya???
Numair did so wrong as like cheating.. He hiding of his problem not only Andaleeb also his family "Hiding is very wrong"
Mawra, who are you actually crying for?
Yes I m indian🇮🇳
Numair to hasan ka bhai lagraha hai😂
Boring drama
We don't expect Hindu rituals in pak darama
This drama is best for understanding and awareness about pyschological issues..almost every person around us got through some trauma in their life  we ignore their behaviours 27:46  .very few dramas based on such issues.great  work .we should understand such people around us and shouldn't ignore their behavior  feelings and emotion dont take them light .
Numair Zara ko psnd krti hai har wqt Zara ki sath bat krti hai😂😂
Numaire like Hassan
I was impressed by Numair's personality. His character is becoming negative day by day
Uffff  so unfair dna test what andleeb poor girl going through😢
At the end ... just SUBHAN ALLAH
Ye itna chor chor kr Q dikhate hain?? Itne scenes miss hoty , random khi se kush b start
This Omar mom n sister looks same , are they orginal Mom N daughter
What numier is doing is very wrong instead taking child to hospital why dont he take test himself again ufff numair i. Hate bottom
All characters of this drama need therapy
Ktne lecture deta hai numair zara ko, but apni bv ko mentally torture kr rha hai apne attitude se! Andaleeb is portrayed as an innocent girl who can’t really makeup for certain situation
Men are v doubtful
Greetings, Jesus’ denunciation of the public display of the scribes which provides a background of genuine religious behaviour on the part of a widow.  Even though no one else noticed what the widow had done, Jesus saw what she did and praised her for it. It is good to keep in mind that even a small deed of love does not escape Our Lord’s attention. How good are we at recognising what others do and affirm them? Or are we so self absorbed that we do not notice and don’t care. Friends, the widow let go of every shred of security and committed herself wholly to God. She showed absolute trust in God with her total generosity. In the eyes of others the offering of the widow was the least but in the eyes of Christ it was the greatest.  “ … but she from the little she had has put in everything she possessed, all she had to live on.”
yarr keya faltu episode that itna mismatch????? epi dekhkar kuch samah nehi aya so many mistakes so many things are missing ,,un realisticcc yee umeed nehi that
He should  clear his doubts
Idk why everyone is blaming Numair. He is trying his best to avoid all his thoughts but it is nature of human, everyone gets negative thoughts. He is representing nothing but facts only.
Hello I am from india I love this show
Love Jafaa<<💞😌
Sweet❤❤love  nmir
Numair ko har waqt zara ki lagi  rehati h par usae andleeb ka pain feelings aur emotions nai dekhate he is more poisonous than hassan
Being  a doctor  numair is acting like duffer 😢
Ab bhot bakwas kar rahe hai is serial ko😑
Pakistan Mai aur specialy Muslims Mai ya godh barai wali rasmy mat kry Galt trend mat lay k ay  Hamary Islam Mai asi cheezo ki koi jagah ni ha we report this drama for this fazoool things

What kind of a therapist is he.. 😂
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩❤
Sharjeenaaa k papa therapist hain 😂😂
I'm from Bangladesh ❤
😓
Zara is a strong, brave, independent and well educated girl❤ Every girl should be like her❤
Shit drama hogaya hai.
Pagal doctor
Numair ki baby kitni cute hein❤❤
A girl needs her mother the most during her delivery. Andaleebs parents were not there at the hospital.
Dna test karle if numair has doubt
Orat bohat safar krti Hy marad k waja say.....😢
Ghar toota hai tu dil toot jaata hai
Hence proved that by Numair k sare mard aik jese hotay hai .
This drama is getting bored just becoz of numair's strange behavior towards andaleep..😑😶
Yha Pakistani Indian rasmy q Ker rha han😢 musalmano k to god brhai ki koi rasm nahe hote
Bht drag kr rahe hy story ko abb KMTM baad mei shuroo hua story speed mei chali week mei 2 days aata tha and end hogaya timely. Ye kabse shuroo hua wa hy drama and end hi nhi honay ko aarha. Bht drag  ..
no
Maharashtra ke chandrapur se kon kon dekh raha he wo hath uper kare❤
end of episode is soooo trumatic 🥺😢
Andleep bechari ab kesa react kry gi
❤❤
Absolutely irrational and illogical story. For a doctor to harbour such doubts about his wifes fidelity is unbeleivable
numair is becoming hasan day by day😂
Hasan ka kya hoga usko nahe dikhaya ek bar bhi
Actually director ne hum sab ko bhi psycho bana diya.ab him sabko bhi therapy ki jarurat hein 😅😅
kitna wait kiye h log😭.jaldi da de n ❤❤❤❤
baby,s smile❤
Doctor k baal nazar aye phir tie up b hogae in the same scene 😂
Koi btaye ga sehar kis brand k kapray pehan rahi.....shocking colour  Orange colour... Light green colour........very beautiful
This ghood bharai is not part of our Muslim culture  What are we portraying?????
21:21 aw the baby is soooooo cute❤❤
yar khen end m numair zara sA Shadi na kr la
Ab pata chala ki sharjeena itna kyun ro rhi thi...kyu ki uske papa usko chhod ke Zara ko therapy Dene aa gye thhe 😢😢😢...poor sharjeena 😂
Yeh numair ko kia ho gya hai 😢
Garden therapy for divorce
I am hating this zara and numair’s bond now yuckkk
Hi I'm Indian I love Pakistan drama 😊
The new man is sharjeena father ( Kabhi mai kabhi tum )17:29  Ek k bad ek serial
21:18 Sharjeena ke papa  therapist ban gaye. Isliye hamesha Mustafa ko daant te rehte thay 😂😂
Waqai numair ab pagal hogya hai so sad for Andaleeb
Really hate the mirror scene
Those innocent souls even don't know the filth of this world and doubt on their birth is too horrible and crime
3 din m beti hogyi😂
Who think the end is near??
Achcha drama hai kya ye.
Numir ko chahiy apna check up krway dr ho k b pagal bna phir rha ha
This is the threshold. The drama turned ugly here.  Nobody asked numair to be that supoortive to deebu after the marriage. But the decided to be a supportive husband. But when his wife was pregnant and that's such a crucial time in a girls life. He was not supportive and the unhappiness was all over numair and oncr that sense of doubt enters your life. There's nk looking back...
Plz week me 2 episode do
Numair should share his concern/doubt with andleeb ,why is he complicating things
Hope for good❤
Itni bri bachi baby to originally first day ka dikhaty
Is baby shower permissible in Islam?🤔🤔
Husband SA Acha ha kuta pal la banda😅.   Good example 😂
Don't make Farah Sadia as a mother in dramas
Zara k husbnd sy zeada to numair patient lugta hy
Farah Sadia don't look at mother. She should be a sister in a drama
Number standing in front of mirror with his daughter was too scary many men killed their children having doubts about their DNA. He hides his medical condition too it's all wrong with the innocent wife and her emotional needs. Please stop portraying such wrong things on screen
Therapist to ptv m morning show krta tha Wohi h na
Last scene give me goosebumps 😭💀
Typical story. Directionless script
Numair bhi psycho lg raha hai
14:11 Arey yeh toh Sharjeena ke papa hain 😂
Bechari dono behan ki qismat kharb dono ko kharab husband mila
Now numair is acting like psycho. ....
Bakwaz ho gya hai👎🏻
Andaleeb should leave him and move on with a baby
Blunder 😂😂😂
Numair needs therapy the most
Sharjeena Abbu ki side job 😂
If andleeb get to know that numair thinks that this child is not his . and he is doubting on her then she will broke into million pieces.....😢
At 16:00 zara nailed it
Nimra ka naam Maria kab se hogaya 😂😂😂
Any one noticed Andaleep at 3.58 . That Maria Aapi k 2 bacche hai instead of Nimra aapi
Numair is having azopermia means absent of sperm (infertility) want to know how this merical happen
14:30 sharjena ke baba❤❤❤
❤❤❤
pubg lover hazri lagao
Sharjeena's father😆
Bohat wrong howa hasan  or zara k liye zara ose samjhte howe b  nai samaj pai 😢😢😢
Any indian here??😂😂
DNA TEST KRVA LY ITNA DIMAG LGANY KI KYA ZARURAT HAI
Love the bonding of numair’s mom and andaleeb❤
O bhai krva le dna kya musibat he iski
Zara ki maa ab khosh ha beti ka ghar ojar k ye hi chati thi na ab kion kehti hm ye nai chate the beta😡😡😡😡
Feeling sad for zara 😢😢😢
Sarjeena ke abba yaha kase ???? 😅
Mumair ko kya ho gya ?
I think numair is more interested in zara than his own wife. He is so much concerned about zara as a friend but to his wife andaleeb he is not proven himself as good husband, always ignoring her. Numair and Hasan both are same only difference is one do physical torture n one do mental torture.
Right now I am watching this drama only for Mawra's Performance  She is just nailing it ❤
Drama theme ,hiw to be like Hassan 😂
Nect episode ki wait mai too hamm log pagal ho jygai 🥺🥺🥺🥺 muje sare episode ajjj hii dekhne h plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ❤❤
Where is hasan
Sharjeena k aba idher aa gaye 😅😅
Zara and her mom conversation❤
Jafaa much better but kbhi main kbhi tum omg
4:07 maria api??
یہ دنیا ویسے کتنا رُلاتی ہے بس اللہ ہی ہے جو انسان کا ہر حال میں ساتھ دیتا ہے اور لوگوں کی اصلیت سامنے لاتا ہے۔
Dramay purani riwayat zinda rakhi divorce larki gud bharayi main nhi àa sakti q panuti Hoti hay woh same Hindu ki rasam ka khas kheyaal rakha gaya hy 😂😂😂😂 Jaye hind❤❤❤❤
Muji lgta hai dno doctor ke shadi ho jaige
BEST DRAMA SERIAL ❤
Ye ek psychological drama isme kai log apni apni problems ki wajah se psycho ho gai hain.jisme Zara ka husband,Numair,Zara e.t.c.hain
Sab ko mental health ki proper treatment chahiye iss drame mein🙃🙃🙃
Ye bollywood ki actress h kya
Any questions here 😅
More INDIANS are watching PAKISTANI dramas then Pakistanis 😅
Apni mental health khrab ho pr dost ko advice dene se pichhe nhi rahte dosti kuchh esi hi hoti h.. I think everyone needs therapist or they should be therapist for eachother 😅
Idk why the heck they're deliberately extending the show with all these stupid fillers  🫠 cmon just end it good
Numair ye bhai kaisaa flip kr rhaa hai
tooo much stupidity
Km az km musalman country me God Bharai ki rsam nhi dikhani chayye thi
I think End Pay Numair aur Zara ki Shadi karwani hai 😅😅😅 is waja say yah sab Kuch ho Raha hai
Bache ka DNA krwane jaraha he magr ye nhi k apna test dobara krwale
Any Pakistani here?😁😅
DNA test krwalo numair bhai bt andaleeb ko shak maat kro😢
Routing for happy ending 🤐🥰
Am I the only one who thinks that sehar khan’s makeup through out the drama was a bit off, these cool toned lipsticks do not suit her
Everyone needs parents like Zara has ❤😊
10;8 scene was heartbreaking for me 🥲
اگر ڈاکٹر صاحب ڈی این کروانے کی بجائے آپنا ٹیسٹ دوبارا  کروا لیتے
dear zindagi photocopied in that therapist scene
Dramay k sabhe characters ko psychetrist ke zrorat hay😂😂😂😂
Numair kaj ta thik korlo na😢
Oooo thank you hum tv tosief bahi ko dahk k kushi hoey buchpun yad agya love u tosief.bahi❤❤
Maybe numair past love was zara
Its very tough for andaleeb  The way numair is behaving  😏 he could have cleared it out insteading of behaving in such a weird way And numair is more worried about zara then andaleeb😢
Today episode too g00d....ek mard dost k roup mei kitna asan hai.or husband k roup mein kitna mushkil.
Pasandida drama serial
Ami bujina ato Joss dramay view nai
Numair did a  clear mistake by not telling a girl about this problem before marriage ( although he told her , he don't want children before marriage , this marriage happened suddenly,  circumstances were stranged on both sides ..also its difficult to tell this kind of thing to someone especially to stranger , it might be easy to tell your partner if you have good friendship with them ) but numair is not a red flag or like hassan... this is an exaggerated statement... People like hassan directly blame their wives , even beat them and speak badly about them... numair is struggling with himself ,and that's very normal  Here in comment section  everyone behaves like an angel.. while in reality people sometimes doubt their loved ones.. even if they don't want to.... so yes numair is being unfair but he is also trying to make himself understand the situation...and I hope he will come out of it .❤ thankyou for writing a real character not just a goody goody angel !!
Tuseeq haider
Best drama only people
This episode was inspired by Indian Serials that's why Numair's scene they r stretching up, numair can have medical check up, he is Doctor himself, maybe he is in love with Zara n can see zara's problem, wbu andaleeb?? She is ur  wife dude, not believing her, showing cold attitude towards her, what nonsense??? Please make good trun in the drama!!
Gair Muslim ka riwaz akhtiyar kar liya Pakistani ne
ho kia raha hai haii
First bar kise pakistani k shows mai kise actor k pet inkala ho dekha hai
tuseeq Haider  see after many years
Is dramay may to every other character is either psycho or becoming psycho 🤦🏻
31.30 very dangerous scene 😢
This js how shaitan insan kai dil mai waswasai dalta hai, numair as a character is just showing the reality of life...
Are sharjeena k abba😂
صلی اللہ علیہ وآلہ وسلم
32:50 Numair rear mirror se dekhe ga nai apne ghar ki car peeche aa rahi hai 😂😂
Numair ko zara dekhti h gum sum bethi h andaleep nhi dekhti h bechari pregnant itna mood swings hota hai lkn bechari kuch nhi bolti
What nonsense. Debu k husband ko us ki parwa ni aur  Zara k sth lagy Howe
Andaleeb acchi h jaldi se paida kar diya mujhe yaha pure 9 month lag rahe hai
#26.36 min 𝙾𝚗𝚎 𝚍𝚊𝚢, "𝙼𝚎, 𝚈𝚘𝚞 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒 𝚄𝚜"♡❤
Numair you are a freaking doctor!! Get some tests done,do something, like get the f out there and remove your misconception dude!
where are the religion limitations? divorce k baad iddat b hoti? ya sab cheezain islam ki hadood paar kar ri
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
In just 2 episodes delivery bhi hogayi😂😂😂😂
numair ki behen nimra se maria hogai?
Ye rasam Islam me hy ky nahi 🤔🤔
Yeh writers sabko bewkhoof samajte hey kya....doctor hey ..kya DNA test nahi karwa sakte
Numair is becoming Hasan day by day 🫠😢😥😂
Ohh Zara it's me  I am the same like u
Indian Wale like kare ❤
Zara super actress ❤
Why is numair acting so childish? He knows andaleeb very well and should trust her, instead he is not giving her enough time and attention
Numair becomes a bangladesh's flag🇧🇩 red spot on green flag😂😂😂
He is so lucky her father always support her ❤ in any situation
In real... Mother goes in post partum depression but here father is in post partum depression😂😂😂
deebu ka makeup bht thopa hua ha hospital walye scence mein bht honak lagrahi ha bachye ka jhoula room mein bilkul rastye mein rakha hua ha
28:55 - 28:59 Faisal Masjid reminds me funeral scene of @ArshadSharifShaheed and @DrAbdulQadeerKhan
Last episode m Zara numair k sath and andleep Moise k sath hogi  M i right..?
I think numair like zara
26.36. Very nice ❤❤❤😊😊😅
Kia hi acha ho k actual therapist ko hi darama mein involve karein.
is ko khud therapist ki zaroorat hay😂😂😂
Numair ko itni he fikar thi k wo baap nhi bn skta tu shadi he q ke krni thi tu chupya q shadi se phly batata
What happened to numair yaar 😢
Splendid! Mene kabhi kisi drame me itna acha therapist nahin dekha. Amazing! The conversation between Zara and the therapist was Very heart touching.
So confusing drama ,ye log jeya Muslim hai ya hindu,woh jo rasham kiya ,abhi tak jitne bhi Pak drama dekhi yesi rashm nehi dekhi jo ki hindu ki tarh hti hai🙄
Mard kitna hi acha ho pr kahi na kahi shakki hota h ye drama shayad ye bata raha h
Psychopath Hassan has made Zara mentally and emotionally distrub that she had to visit therapist 😢😢
Meri tarah kaun kaun wait kar raha tha ❤❤❤
Yess
Marwah acting off so good
Nafrat hy mujhy in logo se Jo bolty Nahi  I mean BAAT Karo Bhai clear Karo cheezain  Numair is just unclear  Why does he tease her wife for moeez
Any Bangladeshi here?🇧🇩
He has gone for DNA test probably😂😂😂
Mustufa k sasur ko new serial mil gaya
Eee numair srif jara jara kiyu krta he yaar
Why numer behaving like this😢
Har koi psycho hi hai is drame mein... Sb ko therapist chaiye .... Pehle andaleep, hassan phir zara or ab nuamir ko bhi ,
Men are therapists for other women but not for their wives
3:56
Feel very sad for zara❤😊😢😮
Haha hahaha hahhhhhhhhhh hahaha
Aasay Baap banaya k qabeel na tha aur jab bangaya to mardangee jag uthi , ek educated Dr say yah umeed na thee Day 1 say confused lagta hay
Andleeb mr jae gi or numair ki shadi zara se hu jae gi mujy lgta h
Numair should also consult some psychiatrist... numair KO moeiz ki betii lagay ge aur mujhy bhi😅😅
bor kar diya ha both
Doctors can also have psychological issues
Kiya nomair bhi Sysco ho gaya hay😁😁😏😏??
Numair is the green 💚 forest with red trees 🎄😂
any cute bachi is here?
Instead of worrying for zara, he should be more considerate towards his wife! He is pathetic at times!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Me from bd
Next episode bhejo jaldi please
Dr numar Ka dimag kharab ho gia h
Who else want tow episode in week ❤😊
This drama getting bhkwass day by day serial banna hi nhi aata h haddd hai🤣🤣🤣
13:34  'Cute Zara Moment'
Humko gussa a rhi numair pe
Went through comments and many people pointed Numair fair enough but understand that how  difficult it is for a man to confess or accept that fact that he can't be father and celebrate in this function with a doubt that baby who is coming is not his own child
Or jb director ko kuch smjh na aye ki drama kese chalaye to phir yh hota h😅.Agr numair ko confusion h to why didn't he tested again for his disease if it is cure or not?...Being a doctor he's doing that level of stupidity 😢
Pl ghair sharie rasmoo ko promote na krain Orr itny mehany gifts deekha ker bachoyoon ka deemagh khraab na krain
DNA test will clearify the rezult but will create the distance between numair and deeebu😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Dr Numair plz abb tum pagal na bano .DNA kara lo . Itni problem hai tuo.
Kya doctor room mein bhi country flag rakhthe hai? Bhai doctor room mein stuufs related to health education rakhthe hai. Not country flag
Iss drama anko dr. Ki   hi zarurat hai phle hasan  fir. zara aur ab numair v
DNA  krwa lain please 😅drma na khrb kry
This is wonderful thought to this episode k jab God pay choro to sab acha hota hai
Numair hospital ki parking me he khra howa hy bewaqoof bna rhy😂😂😂
Any Kokomo here
Wash Turant Khdi hogyi andleeb😂
یہ پیٹ پھلائی کی رسم مسلمانوں میں تو نہیں ہے😅😅😅😅
Why brave people always have high difficulty levels 😢 Why does life become so hard to them
Since when did this baby shower became a traditional/cultural event in Pakistan and most importantly in Islam. Please stop promoting these baseless events.
I am Bangladeshi
Mawra❤❤❤❤❤
I think I’m only the Filipina who’s waiting this episode every Friday 🤭❤️
Sharjeena father😂
🇧🇩
Insan dusru ka saya daty daty khud murgha gata ha ❤😊😢 sad reality
Jafa lovers.. Lets vote for at least  2 episode's in a week.. 🥺
kn kn pubg lover hai
Numeir ko andaleep per saq nehi karni chahiye kya kisi se vi  intimate kar sakta hain andaleep per aager usko varosa nehi hain tooo sadi kiu continue karni numeir andaleep ko deserve nehi karti but moiz deserve andaleep because andaleep ke sadi ke bad vi moize andaleep ko accept karna chahta tha
Yes I am
3.56
Are Sharjeena ke Abba😅
please upload your episodes in 4K like ARY Digital HD
Boys are always careless kon kon agree hh😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Andleeb , Zara and Numair what a performances today , Andleeb’s expressions when Numair takes Moiz’s name and last DNA thing awesome ❤ Zara and Numair’s psychological problem very well performed ❤
I dont like andleeb's mother character . Very superficial bonding with her daughter . Us say ziada apnaiyat to zara ki mama dikhati hain deebu k liye.
If it turns out the baby is his will he regret treating his wife the way he has? Andaleeb is feeling the distance between them the reason for asking if there was or had been someone else. Instead of assuring Andaleeb he brought up Moiz. Mental abuse is just as bad as physical abuse. What Numair is doing to Andaleeb is not right. He should have just told Andaleeb the reason for his being so distant. They could have gone to a doctor together so he could get a second opinion and not go through the anguish of not knowing. Numair is treating Zara better than his own wife.
start mn jo character itna strong tha ab itna weak kesy ho gia
Baby honey ke just baad koi female itna active kaise reh skti h😅
Phlay hasan kr zrurat thi therapist ki ab zara ku bhi ha😊❤
I am from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Is it worng on Numair's part to not tell them before marriage that he can't father a child 😮
This is a very thing to show in the drama that after divorce or breakup it’s normal to get therapy. Therapy is for healing your mental health. Unfortunately pakistanis dont consider therapy after breakup or divorce and they keep hurting other people in their lives.
It I Jodi Beti hogyi😢😂 dekhne m nhi lgrha tha
Was it necessary to do DNA test. Being a doctor he could simply go to doctor and get himself checked as such had not to wait till the child was born. Such a stupid mistake by writer when the character is well educated himself and in the same profession 😂
Numair Zara ko samja raha hai or khud hasan banta jara hai
Numair Zara ko love krta h
Best drama ❤❤❤🇵🇰🇵🇰
Areee sharjeen k Abba therapist hai aj pta chala 😂😂
MOTA buadda hero 😂
Yar ya log kyu itna suspense create kar deta hai 😅
Zara.  You are sooooo me.  😢😢 Same I used to feel for me 😢😢
Numair and zara should have gotten married
Andaleep will die and then numair will marry zara bc he could not take care of child
Such maii ye series ka song kitna atcha heii yrrrrr 😊💗 Kis kis ko atcha lagta haiii batau ....
Zara acting best best best
Who Happy to see jafaa episode ❤but numair behaviour is bad now with andaleeb 😢🥺we want to see numeeb happy together 😊❤
Zara and numair are doctors or..... 😂😂😂😂
Numair apni beti ko kha ly ky ja rha is m itna shocking kya tha ? Ghumany bhi t ly ja skty
Kasy h sb
Yes dear I am Aditi (Nayantara Das) from Bharat.
Zara how fantastic her acting level... It's superb how deeply she play roles
Numair were reading manto. Wow
They are showing reality. Sometimes partners/spouse can understand and solve friends problems but can’t understand or be there for their own spouse problems
Every Friday i wait for this serial ❤❤❤ lot of love from India
14:12, Sharjeena ke abbaaaa 😭....Sharjeena ki bhi counseling krdete 😂
That family moment and that kiss scene ohhh goddd amazing ❤
Am i the only one who feels bad for Moiz?? itna sab kuch hone ke baad sacrifice toh ushine kiya
zara's condition is same as me.
Mawra's acting is outstanding. She portrays strength n realism
Choto Choto🤡
Murtaza uncle ki khud ki beti sharjeena ka ghar set ho gya to ab ye therapist ban gaye 😂😂😂
Andaleeb ne nimra ko maria kh dia
Ywrr e numair to din ba dinnnn dill me beth rha 🥹❤️
At 3:57 andleeb said maria instead of nimra 😂😂 who else noticed 😂😂
❤🎉🎉
❤🎉🎉
❤🎉🎉
Expressing the real sense of depression with such depth at 16:16 I gotta say Mawra you've OUTDONE these expressions!! You've touched the skies of acting and i gotta say you are getting finer by day!
I think zara numair end game hai
numair needs a psychiatrist too . drama portrays that its very hard to break our own shell even if we know the importance to open up.
God bhara e
Ye Deebu ki maa itni typical kyu he. She is so annoying.
❤🎉🎉
pubg waly sary support karo ,mujy ap sub ki supprt chaheay
My favorite drama ❤❤❤❤❤
Mujhe to lgta h numari ab zara ko pasand krne lgega
I wish they had actually appointed a true therapist for the therapy scenes.
Boring day by day
everyone is writing comments in English  Such literate persons are watching drama serials can't expecting 😂😅
Kaya ap log hindo ki ramsay Kar Tay hay ya to hindo ki rasam hay
How many indians are watching this drama??
I love Zara's mother
Ajeeb insan bn gya numair b
Hud hogai... ab Pakistan mn bhi is qism k dramy banegy... yhi reh gaya tha.. burai hai society mn lkn itna neech pana bhi nhi ...  لاحول ولاقوة الابالله   Ye drama family k saath beth kr dekh skty hn kia??!!
Debu ka pet to bht jaldi barha ho gaya hai 😂
Koi batai ga itna time bat Kyo ATA ha
😂😂baccha tumne kiski sakl pr gayi. 31:46 ye scene bohot hi accha thi
Ok😊
And library n zara both husbands mental
Mawara is acting the best I 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰❤️❤️❤️
Ohh hoo!!!  Sharjeena's Father is a Therapist. 😁😁
From nepal
21:40 In the history of dramas, this is perhaps the first time they have casted actually a new born baby to play the role of new born baby 🤌😹
Green flag husband is a myth I guess. Numair has lost his mind too
Ye drama mjy bohot pasand Tha Lakin is dramy nay nya Rukh lay Lia ha
Numair likes zara... Bus I believe he could never express it...  ab since zara is single he is falling for her once again...
Numair hid the fact about his medical condition which was unacceptable. Atleast he should have told his issues to Andaleeb when they decided to continue their relationship 🤷‍♀️
Vote for 2 episodes in the week
Hello 👋
Dr. Zara is my favourite character of all time. Mene kabhi bhi kisi larki ko itna mazboot nahin dekha( apart from novels) aur kind bhi, meherban bhi aur independent baba ki beti. Dr. Zara ke sath aik journey he hamari ke men feel kar sakti hoon ke wo kitni tuti hui hen. Aik emotional si attachment ho gai he Dr. Zara ke sath. Ps. I really respect her, though it's a fictional character.
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Zara k Dr ki acting  to mujah Chhano ka husband thaa tab say achhchhi lagee , fir Sharjeena ka papa n now Zara ka Dr ,inkay pahelay Kay drammay ka naam bataiyah
Toseeq Haider bohat dair bad dakha
16:56 she like tree because the movie of Sanam Teri Kasam
Tbh zara story is one of the great story and Andleeb one is so immature and illogical this all doesn’t happen in real life like forget your love and starting hating him instantly and then living a happy life and i don’t found any chemistry between two of them here just andleeb is mature who doesn’t see anything
14:09 sarjeena's father
❤❤❤
Yes I am Indian
I feel same like zara  I cry a lot in alone
Mawra acting is marvelous
Ye log eki flat ki different room pr shoot kia hy..windows sy view eki hy
Numair Red flag has green spot 😂
Numair is becoming day by day hassan 😂😂who agree👇thanks for 113 👍
Why on earth is she holding her tummy like that?
15:00 sharjeena ke baba
26:39 the moment best moments in this episode 😊
Numair.. tum khud aek nafsiyati maree ho.
I think numair was love zara.,,I feel like!!
Reality is that numair was never a green flag 😢
Numair and andleep chemistry so cute 🥰
Who doesn't skip Zara and hassan scenes after Zara and Hasan fight ....😅😅😊
Who is Maria 😑 numair's sister name is nimra
Andleeb ki beti is very beautiful
Can anyone suggest me some drama like "kaisi teri khudgarzi "...?
For a moment I forgot that Zara was acting  It literally felt so real
Kabhi kbhi buhadur aur samjhdar hona larkiyo k liye saza ban jata hai ..koi samjhta hi ni keh hum insaan b hain.  I can feel for  zahra.  I have gone through all this.
Boring bakwas drama
Shocking
Jaffa lovers comment meh attendance lagao 😂❤
As an Indian Pakistani dramas are better
saray ek drama dekho us ka name the promise  hy wo dekhay ye bhool jaye ge bye bye everyone
Numair ke behen ka na Maria hain ya Nimra?? Confused 😂
Only Jaffa lovers can feel the happiness of Friday night ❤❤❤
Dr. Zara ko dekh kar waqai men lagta he ke wo bohat bare trauma se ghuzri hen. I mean kitni kamzor lagti hen aur kitna kam makeup use kia he aesa lagta he ke makeup he hi nahin. Kamal ki acting he Mawra Hussain ki 👏
Reality based drama .....
Ye konsi rasm hai 😮
My favorit drama❤❤❤
numair apni bacchi ko ayna mein dekha rahe hain  😂
Next episode upload kijiye please please 🙏🙏  And this drama is very best👍👍 I very very like ❤❤❤

Numair zara k st kitna soft spoken h ...shyd isko isi se pyr horha h...andleeb k st ab hassan bn rha h😂😂
14:08  aj pata chala sharjeena ke baba ek well paid psychologist isliye unki mustafa se nahi banti😂😂
Andhra  Im ICC    Im
In sabko hi therapist ki jarurat hai 😂
31:22  ye scene dekh k baby k liye darr kyun lg rha tha😂 villain wali vibes rrhi thi jaise wo khud apne baby ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa😅. Jokes apart Numair can't harm anyone
I also cried 😢
Numair hamesha serious mood pe reheta hai...
Suru suru acha lagta tha lekin ur achha nhi lagjte
Itni joldi 10 month chola geya
Shrjeena kea father  be hai  😊
Arey ye sharjeena ka abbu  therapist kab se ban gaya😂
Any bangladesh here😇
Love from Nepal ❤️
Numair is more worried about Zara than his wife!
Zara's conservative 😢
How wonderfully This drama is portraying the fact   that  mentally abuse and physically abuse both are equally wrong.  I hope the message this drama is giving,  people can actually catch that...
Thanks for uploading watching this drama because of sehar Khan and osman mukhtar 😊
Agar ye show india ka hota to ek week me 3 episode to jarur upload krwa dete india wale ❤❤❤ 😂😂😂 Lekin pakistan me shayad himmat hi na दर्शकों  ki isliye sirf ek upload hone par hi dekh rahe hai 😂😂😂 please yrr km se km 2 to upload kro one week me.   ...
😢 depresion wale logo ki kahani hai
Mawra experisnz Nd acting fabulous 😍
Bachi ko khatarank tareqa sa daikhra jaisa window sa phenk de ga
Is Numair secretly in love with Zara?  Can't wait for him to find out that his doubts about Andaleeb were unfounded and the baby is his because he believed his doctor more than his wife's innocence😮
numair hasan ka roop dharty howy😂
The way numair picked up the child it was really scary 😰  He is turning so bad these days so creepy 😮
Numair ❤
Nomair  also zehni mareez
Numair apna or baby ka face mirror  myn dykhty hwy😂😂😂😂
Any kashmiri here
Numair is concerned about Zara but not for Andaleeb? I can't tolerate this  I know he's having trust issues but he's mature,he shouldn't have done that , director please stop making Numair character bullshit
Me Saudi se hu bhi
For the first time aj numair say itna darr lag rha hai.
Jitna interest numair zara mai leta hai, agar itna andaleep mai le leta to ye itna unpleasant relationship na hota… We all were wrong, he’s not a green flag, his doubt dont make sense because andaleep clearly showed that she hates moiz, he on force sent her to same college acting all liberal , ab sari ghatiya zeheniyat samne aagayee? Ek to apni fertility issues chupaye or dokha diya, phir dna test kerwaya, character pe shak kiya? He thinks she is the kind of girl who would sleep with someone? secondly, he didn’t even look at her when he came to the hospital room if she’s doing okay, he his a terrible husband to have, i mean I would never want this kind of husband, disgusting man
Andaleeb itta hyper q hori h dna test ka sun kr
Nice drama
Numair ko analeeo se jeyada zara ki fikar rehti hae
Please don't involve jara between numair and andaleed🙃 Numair is concern about jara .bt not about his wife .....  His wife also being gumshuda...
Kitna bouring ho gya h ye drama....upr se hfte m 1 episode.... Aur mann nhi krta dekhne ka
I think numair likes Zara in past😮
Y numair is behaving like this as he is a doctor Very weird
Who else noticed that Andaleeb called her sister in law Maria  instead of Nimra!!! 😂😂 Looks like they just want to get done with dialogues without paying attention to the character details. Actually Maria is the name of Numair's mum. When Andaleeb's mom asked Andaleeb if Numair knows about godh barai rasams, Andaleeb said yes because Maria Aapi has 2 children and her functions were done at home.
Only numair
Budda husband asi hi hay
Numair sounds so drunk😂
Best drama different story
And now I think last episode is coming soon in 3 to 4 weeks 😮
Ye numair toh red flag nikla
Kaun kaun mizoram se hain😂
31:10 how negative emotions can control a person
In the beginning of episodes there used be a positive feel for numair   But these couple of episodes are really irritating
Yes
لو جی پیٹ بھی نکل آیا
Worst drama ever
First time seeing husband participate in Godh bharaiyee.
It's so peaceful too see andaleeb and her mother-in-law's bonding so fresh & pure ❤

What the Fffffffff is wrong with numair
I don't know why but I love the scene of 26.00🙂❤️❤️
Bura drama mein baap beti ki Jodi hi dikhaty hay I watch only For Zara Hassan 😭😭
People saying why numair don't this but think of it you know all those years that you can't be a father but now you wife is pregnant . So isn't it common for you to  suspicious even if it for only one moment of time.
Mard ko har wo larki ki dard dukh dikhta hai uski patni ki ilawa 🥹👌🏼
Ye muslims me bhi go bharai hoti hai kya.?? .Islam me to aisa kuch nhi likha hai
Amazing.....the way zara explained the situation of a mentally disturbed person is just wonderful ❤❤
Trauma not tarama😅
Any Bangladesh here?😊
Getting bore day by day seriously
The way zara control her emotion and pretending to be ok in front of her mom is highly commendable and touching yarr!😢
Wow ye drama ky hai roz ana chaiye iska episode❤❤❤❤
Aur kisi k liye itna intezar nhi Kiya jitna iske liye krti hu 😂
Haye kahen writer andleeb ko maar k numair aur zara ke shadi na krwa den..plz aisa nai krna..
34:30
Instead this modha numair they should focus on Hassan mystery n interesting story 😢
Mujhe to inko khani samaj nahi aa rahi hai ek ki story he chala lo thik se😅
Dekhne main Jara ki ammi ammi nehi lagti, uski behen lagti hain🙂
He cares about his wife's sister but not his wife 😂😂
iss tarha ki rasmain Karke app log konse culture ko promote karahe ho
Andleep is so cute ❤
Ye sharjeena ke father yha aagye ab 😂
Kalash hoone waala hai 😢
No
I literally can't hold my tears to see Zara's emotional desolation and her pain💔😭
If numair has any suspection in mind he could've cleared it out with Andaleep. Yeah he is confused that if he couldn't become the father then from where does the baby come from but secretly taking the infant to DNA test is not cool. Also now after hearing all this from him she'll get broken into million of pieces.
Numair is gone mad
Any chitrali here
Legends people only watch drama no like no subscribe 🤣😂✅
Love this drama ❤
G Allhumdulilh
When Numair cries on the prayer mat, that shows how you can open up to Almighty ALLAH without any restrictions or hesitation.
Who is watching this drama within one hour of uploading 😅
Baby name???
Guys andaleeb ny pillow rahkha 😂😂
Numair has the time and mental capacity to counsell zara and listen to her worries and is yet ignoring andaleebs anxieties giving her a cold shoulder?
Love from Bangladesh ❤🇧🇩
