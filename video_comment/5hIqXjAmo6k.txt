that was WILD !!  but the commentary made it tbh 😭
Oh my god….if I was on that plane I’d be yelling TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fedex flight 80 😂
Its a good thing the pilot didnt over correct 😂
Best commentary ever mate
Gerry normally stuttering not here seems the excitement cleared his glitch 😂😂😂
"Dear passengers,  this is your captain speaking. I hope you weren't scared. My beer bottle just slid against the control stick."
i've had this on replay! lol funnnny!!! but glad it made it's way safely!! <3
Blind people listening😨
😅
Is it bad that I've watched this 7 times in a row?
jeeeeeezus!!! i need a change of underwear from just watching it!!!!
9 OOOOO's
Rudder Hell!
Breathtaking capture! May I feature it in my project with credit? Thank you!
So Ryanair landing
This is a good video to show for those Who do not think it’s important to buckle up and wait for the plane to come to a complete Stop , At the gate .
I can't imagine how it felt like inside as a passenger
The last dirty pr0n I saw had the same audio.
I thought the English were known for their reserve.
That is the only airlines i will ever fly
Those pilots werent even panicking. If they thought it was dangerous then it would be a simple “Go around”
US pilots aren’t used to a slight sidewind🙄
The voiceover of many adult videos now ❤😂
💯💯💯💥💥💥👍👍👍
I don't envy any of the passengers on that plane
Wild. W Pilots!!
I think the pilot stalled it
The problem with heroes, is they get people killed.
😂 STOP THAT!
Skid in his pants was long too
Commentary always incredible 😂
Gosh, weren't kidding with the insane part! :P
Reminds me of the PG TIPS advert in the 80s with the chimps pouring the tea. Can imagine the chimps as pilots landing that 777 😂 Think the PG TIPS tea would be all over the cockpit. 🙈🙉🙊🐵
Captain 1: Whats happening aren't you landing it? Captain 2: No I thought you were, hold on bud, hold me beer.. 😅
I have one word. Terrific!
Easy son:)
i use your this video.please dont give me strike.
Oh but that's not an B777, sorry
Fedex flight 14 ahh landing💀
It would be preferable for one to describe what is happening and refrain from the, "Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh....."
Easy tiger 🐅
Is that 300fpm touch down?
408 Reinger Plain
@0:32 the lady walking in the foreground was not impressed
Hello LONDON
Hello
Hello from TIJUANA MEXICO
Meh. Wasn't that bad. Could've been worse
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Bro came Like 6 times oh oh oh god oh
Llego 5 meses tarde pero este vídeo apareció en las noticias de Chile
That was insane!!
That commentary is going to go viral behind all sorts of dubious videos.
pilot mustve sneezed in the cockpit
I thought he was about to take off again , that was awful landing
man alive!! I was also like OH OH OH!
nice catch!
Commentator sounded horrible
slamming ithat beautiful 777 onto the runway 😢
Oof!
Seems like the pilot wanted to get home asap 😂
Never fly Ametican......personally i would only feel safe in a storm on British Airways, Aer Lingus or Ryanair!
He didn’t GA,because of his training! Hello
Pipe down.
The commentary  is what make this video so good
Typical auto throttle dependent pilot landing in windy conditions 😎
Blud tried to create fed ex flight 80
I wonder how they felt inside that 🤣
P.I.O.
the spoilers get fully deployed although the plane bounces back in the air. was it done manually to avoid another bounce or eventually a go around? great catch Mr Big Jet TV keep up the great work and commentary 😄👍🏻
That nosewheel hitting the runway and bouncing back up many feet into the air. I guess the Pilots launched themselves out of their seats.
Was someone behind you?
Appalling….Had to be either a trainee or a female piloting! 🙄🤡
the ryanair house has found its new host
Not the best commentary, but exciting clip anyway
Amazing!  Dude was determined he was NOT going to go around.
I have a friend that flew for American Airlines for 20 years and then went to work for the FAA for  another 20 years. After the 9-11-01 attacks they had to get special clearance for him to fly to New Orleans and pick-up his boss. He and his family have been to a lot of interesting places.
FedEx flight 80
As you say: every landing you walk away from, is a good landing…
And the woman walking never knew a thing about it🤣.
Wind shear just above the ground ?
Nearly repeated FedEx 90 all over again 💀💀
Wow that was an amazing catch! I was waiting for the vortex then bam! A jiggly 777!
🤣
*bo beep* “WIND SHEAR. WIND SHEAR. WIND SHEAR.”
Do you have to be histarical 😮
The commentary is ...priceless!   I rewatch this regularly as much for the British commentator as for tge extraordinary footage. Someone please tell me who is the commentator. Is his name Jerry?
Well, I know what my new ring tone is going to be ... Ooooo oooo Stop That!
wow
New Ryanair
Oh flippin eck 😂😂😂
great play by play... almost  orgasmic...
I would have puked.  The Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhhhh Ohhhhhhhh didn't help.
Kudos to those pilots… x
american airlines made ryanair look smooth
0:28
That was definitely pilot error.
If you look closely at the video, and pause it just before it sways left, you'll see the left flap go up.  To me, it looks like pilot error.  The plane was already swaying left slightly when the left flap went up.  It's like the pilot compensated in the wrong direction, then scrambled to get it back under control.
Narrator gets excited….
Pilot: "I'm glad my pants are black."
TOGA!!!!!!!
As pilot approaches on his final, observe how he’s in a “slip”. Then straighten at the touchdown. Wow!  Surperb piloting!  Slips are fun but only if you know what’s going on.
Remind me to never fly American
You just gotta love those Brits
Whoa Nelly! Looked like it was too late for a go-around maybe. Pilot was beyond awesome to get that thing down w/out crashing.  Commentary was a hoot (I was glad to be watching it alone b/c otherwise someone might have thought I was watching porn!!).  I'm sure that everyone getting off the plane needed a clean pair of pants!
My guess would be ex military pilot(s). No panic just get the plane on the ground.
That was Unbelievable!
That was the wind making that weird landing or stalling
Wow that was some bouncy landing..good camera work and great commentary..Jxx 💐🇬🇧🌼
Those crosswinds must have been insane.
My favorite video this year😂
I feel you’re lucky to see these kind of landings. And it seems like London and surrounding towns/cities are notorious for windy weather
That bounces Gave me flashbacks of fedex flight 80 😮 but you can tell the pilots are skilled they used a quick thinking crabbing technique and absolutely landed that triple 777 .
Oh Sycamore Johnson,,, that was a closed call oka
Blancolirio coming in hot from Cali.
not funny
That must have been incredibly frightening for the passengers.
It’s tough landing on these carriers.
So Russian plane blew up and dissapeared the glass never broke and the plane jet fell into Yellowstone volcano with King salman earthquake spike inside it 😭
Id love to see a video from inside the plane.
Always carry a spare pair of shreddies or knickers 👍
That lady getting another Polo Mint, oblivious to the drama happening behind her 🤣
WOW! That landing was hairy,  but the commentary was a classic. 😂
Hahaaaha.. Oohooh ohh ohh..stoppitt!! Hilarious, thanks for the laugh.
Good piloting!
Oooooo ooooooo ooooo ooooo 💀💀
On the PA: “Captain Crash would like to welcome you all to London, where fortunately there are plenty of bars in which one can go and calm your nerves. He’s buying the first round for us all”…
pilots just having fun😂...less pressure without screaming passengers and no possiblity  of  a lot of fatalities😂
Oooh oh oooh oooh, I was gripping my chair - scary 😳
Someone took your video and played it on their channel. I don’t think they acknowledged you.
Bro made it to Sky News 💀
That was wildly dangerous. 😮😮
i thought this was at EGLL but were they landing on 09L or 27L? and where was it filmed from?
3rd fedex 80 almost happened
wow
unremarkable without all the oooh oooh ooh
Heard this on BBC Radio 2 during the storms and it made me come looking for the video. Glad I did, have now subscribed. That landing was an exciting one, experienced something similar myself once landing at Perth, AUS. new underpants may be required 😂
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion is not a safe idea in the cockpit.
Juan Browne sent me.
Georgia
Why do they not cancel these flightsatvyhe start?they know what's the weather at the destination. Something need to happen for that?
Dude! You just made it on CNN! They showed this clip and credited you! Bravo! 🙌
Must have been the copilot's landing.
😂 was the cameraman a passenger too?
Bottom dropped out... Maybe Wind Shear?
Fantastic commentary!
Some brown underpants in the cockpit!
Now that was a BOING BOING.
Oh oh stop stop it!
Bad pilots
Whoa! 😮
I thought Jerry was having a fit 😂😂
The commentary .............................. PRICELESS 😁
Ryanair is looking to buy stakes in AA🧐
Wow scary stuff but your commentary was hilarious and gets even funnier every time I watch it.
This is gonna be the emergency landing
Bet that resulted in a visit to M & s for new underwire
Reminds me of  'Alan! Alan! Alan! Alan! Al! Al! Aalllaaann!'
Some seat got sucked up....
OH OOHHHH OOOOHHHH OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH STOP IT  relax bro. 🤣
Givin it all that geezer!! 😂
Love the narration, did he get excited or what. It was an insane landing. Kudos to the pilots.
Does he need a wash cloth now?
PIO maybe
Thank God I wasn't a passenger on this  plane 🙏
Eric Eric Eric
PILOT ERROR...blancolirio is an expert witness if any lawyer needs some ammo in court for injured passenger
Ex military pilots no doubt . Just think airlines are now hiring based on gender and skin color 😳
“Excuse me stewardess, I’m going to need a clean pair of shorts.”
Everyone’s boo-boo hole is puckering up on that landing!
Made on Juan Brownes channel Mr Dyer..well done.
Trop courtes les vidéos ! Et Saint Michel en Brenne ?
New pants please😂
I saw your footage on CNN. I had to come watch this for myself
seriously skilled pilot's,  but big big shout out to that plane's manufacturer Boeing,,,,, what stunning stunning engineering  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A great example of pilot induce occultation (PIO) and overcontroling the aircraft.  He was too slow at that point to go around and either the flying pilot or the Captain (likely the captain) eventually stopped the corrections and eventually brought the jet under control properly.  This can happen sometimes when trying to cross control of over control the rudder on landing in a large transport aircraft.  Hard to say here, but keeping the landing attitude is important and/or an early go around as you mentioned.
I really hope the pilots did say 'oh flippin eck, hold on a minute' 😂
Brilliant 🤩 footage 😂
tower, could you see if someone can bring me a new clean pair of britches before I depart this aircraft?
This is what happens when you're a senior AF and on the top of the seniority list and only fly one trip a month at most, you forget how to fly. In the full many hours long video, video the majority of the planes landed just fine but here looking at the control inputs it's yet another blatant case of P.I.O. It all goes downhill where for some idiotic reason he just slams the ailerons left at 0:25 when it was absolutely unnecessary as they were perfectly stable before that and it all goes to hell from there. As a former check airman I used to see this all the time.
A visual representation of an old aviation saying, “Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing”
this was in the news
Pass the sick bag and nappies please........
you could see the wings waggling right before touchdown 😬
You made it on Juan Brown’s Blancolirio channel.
Juan paid due respect 'ay Jerry. Nice one!
Epic catch, Jerry! 🙌🏾😭
Blind people: holy, those are some strong winds and impressive skills  Deaf people: 💀
When I was passing by I’ve heard you screaming from the street! 😅
Jet Pilots : 20 + people are filming your every landing and if you fk it up millions will see it on youtube.  No pressure 😂
Crazy!!
Just a minor check if everyone had clicking the belts correctly.
“Ooo oo oo oo oo oo ooooooo!!” 😂😂
Pretty wild landing! Thank God they got that occillation stopped and held the nose off after the 1st bounce! I used to feel the wingtip vortices, even thought possibly some of what i thought were wing tip vortices were generated by the air out of the engines when they used to fly in right over the top of me at where i watched them landing near the Columbia river just east of pdx.  Sometimes those vortices would start up really strange looking/acting tornadoes on top of the river even. They were that strong.  And they really feel weird when they drop right down on you so you can feel them when youre in the path. I was aware of them because I sat next to the river just off a boke path, and if a jogger happened to run thru 1 without realizing what was going on, it could be a little confusing to them.  Very strange effect to actually feel. Loved the reaction of Jerry!  Just hopped over from the Blanco Lirio channel who did a video on this that really explanes it well.  He's a FO on a 777.
Blancolirio brought me here to see the footage and what the heck…that Triple 7 did a wee jig as it landed. 🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿NZ
0:29 best reaction make me laugh all the time
Anybody know the registration number of that jet??
Juan Brown sent me. 👍
Pilot induced..watch the left aileron go up.causing the left wing to dip.. that was a screw up...my guess..a copilot that was instructing in a c172 last year.
Hahahahha
Brilliant! The commentary was spot on - we all did not know what to think or say, and by the time we did, the pilot had sorted it out!
Who knew London had bucking bronco 777 aircraft? 😂. Well they walked away and the plane was not damaged… okay just taxi in … phew 🤔
This to me looks more like pilot error than wind shear. The left wing dip looks like a direct result of the flight spoilers going up on the left wing and opposite inboard aileron working to lift the right wing at 0:25. Not sure if it was the computer sending that command or direct pilot controls. You can also notice the same left wing flight spoilers going up on the wing rebound, when the wing goes up too fast as they try to push it back down
Juan sent me.
Man, you should be an airshow commentator.  You'd have the crowd oohing and ahhing when something every time there was a high speed pass.
Pilot did a good job.
Heathrow: 01:02.00 takecoff approval 01:02.03 Landing approval
PIC to SIC: "Log that and one takeoff and three landings."
When a pilot decides that it's now or never, and has the skills in spite of the weather conditions😮, to pull it off.
Hey I'm here from blancolirio Channel, you are awesome just like Juan said too, thank you, subscribed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣👍
Juan Brown sent me over to this, great commentary sir!
Here from blancolirio, thanks mate.
Ladies & Gentlemen we've just landed at 9:01 & 9:02!!! 😄Cheers!!!
Weather channel app used part of this video.
Vengo aqui por los noticieros de bmftv 😂
That could have been fedex flight 80😮
Quit waving bye bye I’m getting sea sick🤮
that was not so much dangerous situation. the pilot did that  with confident .
A bit of over controlling from the copilot there, I think ?
Can you edit the ooh ooh ooh they are so annoying ?
At least everybody on Board was not tired anymore. Phheeww.
I love how he says Los Angeles
So Funny!!  Jerry makes this channel so much fun to watch on windy days
Stunning capture! I wonder how passengers felt inside that plane. Hoping somebody captured an in-flight video that we can watch!
Jerry your landing is on Reuters, your a star!
You weren't loud enough. The lady in the background had no idea this all happened.
Holy .....
Good job!!!
I think the commentator was more dramatic than the landing itself.  Chill dude...
That is crazy it's on the news as well! 😮
brilliant, sport landing
After being airborne for 10-11hrs……there is no such thing as going around. Lol.
Please collect clean underpants on exiting the aircraft 😂 well done pilots 👌
Btw this video made it to polish television! Polsat news.
Honestly it might look like a skill issue but it’s not. The fact he landed that thing is insaneeeeee. Most jets would get a goaraund. He must be very experienced.
Wind shear... From the left or maybe a powerful microbrust....  You just don't lose lift like that out of the blue.... Anyone know the field TAF or Metar for that day?
A little bounce caused by the nose wheels contacting the ground first, but otherwise soft contact with the runway.  On other airports this would be a normal every day landing. (It's currently a 40 km/hr blustery quarterly cross wind across Wellington airport.)
Wind shear at touchdown!!! Great piloting skills!!!  Hope the PAX are OK!!!
calm down, calm down!
I was on a Southwest flight and I swear, the pilot just dropped us out of the sky onto the runway, no easy 3-point landing, and not only did we almost fold up on ourselves when he engaged the brakes, we bounced a couple of times.  A Delta stewardess sitting next to me that was deadheading said “must be a ex-navy pilot”.  I thought of that when I saw this plane land.
😂😍
Completely bonkers landing, but commentary fantastic.
Don't they all land like that?  Maybe I should pay more attention...
those pilots earned their pay with that landing
great video if muted
Stop it!
Bro... you have gone viral here in the States. All the news stations are showing your video
That commentator sounds like he's 12 years old.
Hope that wasn't Juan Browine (YouTube: blancolirio) who flies this route often for American Airlines.
That left wing just dropped out...scary AF for the passengers, but amazing footage. Thanks, Jerry!
Best to watch it with the sound off.
I can’t wait for the @MentourPilot analysis of this landing, saying nothing until then, hopefully he will do one on this!
I was on the flight...needed a diaper change and a heart transplant afterwards, but I am good now!
The alarms went off in American’s flight monitoring department.
Go Around… Flight Path Management Rule #2: Avoid large control movements close to the ground…
Just saw this on nbc4 New York.
Allah hu akbar❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
This is one of the reasons I'll never fly on American Airline
Trying to explain to my wife thst I'm not watching porn
All those 23 year old FOs with just over 1500 hours in a Cessna.
It amazes me he did not collapse the nose wheel he definitely should have done a go around.
Wow, thank goodness for landing gear suspension. How was your flight? Oh it was just a short hop lol
Commentary was epic
I've only been watching regularly a couple of months but this was the craziest landing I've ever seen.  I need to check more of these short videos to see if there are any that are crazier.
Euuu, Euuu, Euuu, stop it!
why did it look so big-
Just saw this on CNN lol.
Ha ha, I just got off a dodgy flight from Glasgow and I saw this trending when I got home.
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh Stop That Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh Ahhh
Glad I was at home and not in that plane. Glad it landed safely
....go around..?
This has gone viral. The commentary makes this video. Well done Jerry
Gonna have to replace all the seats in that plane....💩💩💩
RyanAir: Hmmm...how can we top that?
that was WILD !!  but the commentary made it tbh 😭
Check wipe for those PAX 😂
triple 7 comes with a sphincter check when you least expect it..
I love this air plane commentator
Dying of laughter 😂
Been there! I'll never fly into Heathrow again.
Great filming...congratulations,  saw this clip on Norwegian media too...🇳🇴
Only a captain could do that!
Amazing landing.  Just letting you know this footage made it on the national news here in Australia.
Oh stop it Ron stop it...
How do I get Jerry’s comment as a ringtone,?😁
Very hard on the nose gear.  Frequently breaks it. Expect it was inspected.
Looks like he over corrected.
I hope they changed the seat covers in the cockpit afterwards.
greed has no end for airlines flying in dangerous weather. yes, your life has a dollar sign on it.
Ah, another dose of a man, standing in a field, in the storm, SHOUTING AT PLANES!
Bumpy landing? Too much wind sheer! Saw this with your YouTube coverage .
That was an appalling loss of control by the pilot at the end there. With such a loss of control, he should have gone around and tried again.
That just made me so f'n nervous
Your clip made it to the 6pm news down here in New Zealand
We couldn’t hear the vortex because the cameraman was spazzing out.
PHOTOSHOPPED.
seems easy peasy,  didn't randy quaid and wife squat around in Hollywood???  😂😂😂😂😂
Wow the skill of those highly trained pilots with a superb  commentary, I was on the end of my sofa watching this video, It would have been great respect to shake the hands of those pilots.
only thing crazier than the landing is the absurd over reaction of the narrator.  Good Lord 🙄"Stop that" indeed.
If you listen closely you can hear the passengers screaming.
Maybe the pilot was just distracted by you filming and yelling
Arnold Horshak moved to London?
Pro strats pilot, nice work.
Made the news in the States. CNN has it on its website..
Seeing this live was something else, kudos to the pilots I know that was a rough landing
It looks like speed brakes were deployed before touchdown and caused the left wing to stall a few feet off the ground. Lucky for everyone on board this happened as low as it did.
Probably the only time in the pilot's career he would have to use some obscure training he never thought he would need to use.   It could have turned out worse.    Excellent job.
The news took this and used it. Did you get credit?
The weather is so  depressing
it looks shaky from this angle actually if you watch it from the side is not bad
I wonder what caused that ?? Wake Vortex or Cross Wind Gust ?? Pilot was keeping left wing down and the wind paused for a few seconds??
It's Frank Spencer 😂
Mrs. Patroni: "Well, the first stewardess is at the controls, but she... she's in constant touch with the tower."   Airport 75
Jerry & the 777 made the news here in Australia lol
Apparently this a/c was grounded as it blew a few landing gear hydraulic lines.
On CNN's main page. You're world famous Jerry .. again
Oh man you Brits!    Lol.   You make everything so much more spectacular.  Great job.
This video was shown on Fox News today.
I couldn't hear the vortex hitting you over all the shouting
Those pilots were fighting the Universe with that landing!😲 Oooo my Goodness! I would love to have them be my pilots for any flights I will have in the future. I know they will fight the Gods to land a bird of that size and power. Big respect to them.
Still wondering how this wasn’t a go-around, wild.
@0:28 Arnold Horshack lives!!!
😗😗
Watch the elevators…Pilot induced errors.
If he drives in LA traffic, that landing was a piece of cake!
Well Jerry this went crazy viral all over the world you are now internationally famous.  Congrats!
The pilots AND passengers were like, "Oh, flippin' heck!!"
Where are those anti seatbelt people now?
Ladies and gentleman, they have potholes here to.
Just saw this on the tv news here in L.A.  Can’t imagine being on this flight. Oof.
Today on my plane we touched the ground then went back up in the sky again. It was so windy that when we tried to land the gust of wind would’ve knocked us over, so we had to go back up.
Glad the amazon packages arrrived lol..pilots are the best!!
Love the commentary! Thank you for the smiles!
Do we have footage from inside?
Can you imagine what that would have felt like did they record it ?
Can't believe that wasn't a go around.
Ooh stop it?
Just saw this video on “The Weather channel” here in the US!
0:27 Never mind the crosswind landing , who was it that was indecently assaulting him and why didn’t he stop?
Just saw your video on French TV. That makes me less confident boarding a plane again
😮😮😮😮
See you got a mention on ITV Jerry on this bit of footage
your video was on the news in belgium
Flipping heck!
No doubt some people will say "all in a days work for a pilot" but one of my customers was RAF then flew British airways for nearly 20 years, we were talking about a similar incident a couple of years ago and he told me that every time something like that happens you could crack a walnut between the cheeks of your jacksie!
I felt sick then lol! I remember being on a flight with a similar landing and we all cheered when we felt the wheels safely down 🌹
Seems your clip made it across the pond as they say. In America on local news channel KTLA 5 los angeles to be exact. 👍
A true classic brown underpants landing for all those on-board. Imagine what was going through the minds of the customers, never mind the crew!  CLASSIC show Jerry and Gilly and well done for making world wide news.
How does something this heavy get blown about like paper. Make you think.
Definitely recommend listening on mute.
Bonus for that pilot!!!
This landing was heart in mouth Jerry…amazing! Loved your stream yesterday. Will be subscribing to your channel when I get my iphone sorted as it keeps subscribing my maths account in error. Got a timeout on another channel for saying “oooh oooh oooh moments at Heathrow”… but i was in unison with you most of the time! Never even said your stream name 🤷🏽‍♀️ but I’ll be recommending your channel whenever I’m allowed after that! You did a great day’s coverage 😍😍 the ponies were good too 🐴
Smooth landing.
That was pretty ugly
ARE THAT USER RECORDED WAS SICK OR WHAT?.. ITS HARD TO HEAR IT... 😮😮😮REALLY... HOW OLD ARE YOU GOSH.....
This is why airline pilots earn such a good salary. A perfect example of the skill level needed for the job.
I'm scared to see this aircraft landing and it is bouncing. Almost go around and landed safely.
My guy went into full on horseshak mode OOOO OOOO OOOO
I'd have puked 🤣
this and the air canada 777 bouncy landing. amazing videos, but not sure if i want to be a passenger on those flights!
She's already back in service.
Very similar to an Air Canada 777 landing in Toronto recently.
Never seen a B777 get that jiggy with it! Some real cool moves going on there!🕺Jerry's excitement is the icing on the cake!👍👍🤣
Love the commentary 😂 that was insane
wibble wobble wibble wobble
Give that pilot a huge raise!!
Thought you were gonna say "Oooh Matron!!"  That was the funniest thing I have seen on telly all Xmas!
Talk about a scary landing!!
Windshear 😮
Just seen this on the Guardian website - had to come over and say - nice!
Just like how I do it in FSX
I almost pissed my pants just watching that!!
Massive elevator inputs there, yikes!!!
This clip was just on my local TV station KTLA breakfast news in Los Angeles and they did credit Big Jet TV!!
Omg! That was crazy to see! I can't believe they didn't do a go around! I'm glad that they managed that well!!
that was wild!
You even made it on to bbc news!!! 😊
Omg that was insane😱😱😱
He should have gone around and questions will definitely be asked. This isn’t good at all.
Wow 🤩 that made the world news.  Hopefully the passengers where alright
This footage made the morning news here in Denver, Colorado 😬👍
Wow 😮
Jerry, you have reached celebrity status with this video. There is an article on the Evening Standard with the video. Can't post a link here... Should be easy to find on their website. It goes like this...  Video footage shows the hair-raising moment a Boeing 777 struggled to land at Heathrow Airport due to strong winds from Storm Gerrit.A clip posted online shows the aircraft jolting above the runway in foggy and windy conditions before landing safely.
Jesus Christ! That is absolutely terrifying!
Triggered my anxiety!!
Im so pleased you made the mainstream media,  i wonder if this can be made into a gif? My family gave me a very old fashioned look when they heard me playing this
You’re all over the news!!!
Deepest girlie voice I've ever heard...
I saw this on the live stream on replay. Thanks for showing it again.  Happy subscriber and member 😊!
Looks like the first dip to the left was AFTER they lifted the left flaps but not the right.
That is bad..AA wil be able to analyze the video. Ghosh .. sitting inside an aircraft, you don't know what is going on outside
Hey guys your clip was on One News, the main news channel in new zealand on thursday 28/12/2023
Your on gb news
Blimey, u sounded like my imaginary girlfriend last night
Sounded like an unrequited backscuttle.
0:29 - 0:33
Omg, respect with salute to experience Pilot
Clean up in the cockpit, please!
I don't know how many times they've played this on gbnews this morning, my partner has it playing in the background and every so often I hear Jerry Oh! stop It! It makes me laugh every time. They've just said ' we'd like to point out that isn't the Pilot you can hear" 😅
do you need some tissues ??
Watched it live yesterday .. Chat went mad    at  that landing !
the enthusiasm from jerry is what i love about him.
Wow, saw it too yesterday on live. Bigger aircraft are more pron to get hit by windshear especially during a storm. That should have been a go around but seemed, they had low fuel almost on Bingo code as the pilots decided to not go around or for a divert after the left wing got hit by first by it and went out of the balance quite a few times,  the cockpit was screaming of windshear alert but still well done by the pilots to keep cool as they should stay calm and focused, no matter, what.
What is NFP?
Imagine having to do a go-around and be subjected to another 15-20 mins of sweating and handwringing.  Nightmare!
Thought the commentator was having a moment there! 🤔
The pilot really has done a great job. In aviation landing and taking off are the most difficult parts of the journey. Nice landing and taking off for all travelers this festive season. God bless your journeys. ❤🎉
Go Jerry! This video making GB news this morning. 😅😅
Was it good for you Jerry?
how was that not a go around
The commentary is insane. 🤣😅
AA- 'Your fired' Ryan Air- 'Your hired'
Crosswind really said “you haven’t had an intense landing today let’s make it a little more insane”
I too watched this live and the best bit was the commentary as he shouted instructions at the plane!!!!!
Jerry ….. they are playing this on GB News this morning  ❤❤
Stupid should gone around dangerous
While the telephoto lens does exaggerate aircraft movements, that landing was every bit as wild as it appeared.  There was obviously a crosswind  on the approach, and that looked normal, but the way it suddenly started thrashing around as it neared the ground has me thinking wake turbulence.  Yes, even something as big as a 777 can be upset by wake turbulence, especially from another heavy.  Another possibility, given the crosswind from the left, could be any buildings upwind that might be creating mechanical turbulence (though we can’t see that direction in this video).  One thing is certain:  Any time your 777 touches down nose wheel first, it’s a bad time.
So funny. Just watched this on BBC news and it dawned on me that for the people that don’t know about the channel they might think the audio is from the pilot!
my girlfriend and friends were on that flight.
Almost Another FedEx flight 80 happened 😳
Just watched this on Australian SBS News mainstream television. They kept in the "oh oh oh" only lol..classic stuff
Lord Jesus!!!!
Was watching live - PARP !!
Good save by the pilot.
Wow
Love the added ohh ohhh ohhh sound effects! 😹 But otherwise glad it got down safely , kudos to the aircrew!
Looking forward to this one on 74 Gear & your sizzle reel LOL
Great clip and commentary! Kudos to the pilots.
That or those pilots are real PROS 💪🏼 and people are complaining.
Welcome to LHR where we can confirm we have ARRIVED.
The audio escalated quickly... Without video
i hope @blancoliro wasn't pilot flying lol
Wow! Amazing to see how crazy this landing was! 😮
Blimey!!! Have a word, Jerry 😂😂😂
This was used on BBC breakfast 28th December
100% pilot induced.  Watch the control deflections, every single movement of that aircraft was commanded.  The elevator deflections were INSANE.  Very poor handling on the pilot’s part.
Well that was interesting! Not stable to land. Not stable to go around!....
Always crack me up Jermery !
Any landing you can walk away from is a good one
✈️. Congratulations Jerry and Ginny! Big Jet made America’s ABC Nightly News this Wednesday evening with your video. They gave you credit BRW with your logo upper right corner. 👍
Meanwhile Ryanair pilots be like Hold me Beer
That was CRAZY! 😜
Wow, you made the news in New Zealand!
Oh oh oh stop that OTT commentary reaction. 😂
Hi mate, we laughed this made the six o clock news in New Zealand, and you were going ape with ohh ohhh ohhh stop it, 😅😅😅
PIO?
Totally pilot induced.  If you watch the control surfaces the pilot made all that happen.
Watched this happen live and I was SHOCKED but, at the same time I was laughing at Jerry's "OOOH OOOH OOOH OOOH OOOH STOP IT!"  LOL
That was *dangerously* close to stuffing the nose gear.
I wish people would stop describing stuff as INSANE.
Watched this live. I'm guessing any shop in the vicinity of that gate that sells underwear had a successful morning. 😳
Oh wow that's a wobbly landing. That time, it's wind shear or unstable landing. I have never seen a plane that is landing unstable.
Some guys first flight…  Man this wasn’t that ba ohhhhhh my god!!!!
You was on the news of California Kcal 9/cbs2 news
Ooof. I can imagine the clean-up before the next flight.
God damn 😮😮😮😮😮 that was Insanity landing on the triple seven
Just a few extra minutes to replace the nose gear.
I see these planes everyday
Good thing there were no windows for the pax.
Woohoo! That plane was a bucking Bronco! Fantastic landing! 🤗
This guy is a loony tunes
Coffee went everywhere 😂😅
Was that Juan?
Imagine texting someone and being interrupted by such substandard  piloting. Now really?
Was watching that live when it happened. Have to think that both pilots may have been in need of a few adult beverages after that one, and the passengers all in need of a change of underwear!
Classic case of the PF thinking the mains were on the ground when in fact they were not.  The aircraft was simply doing what it was told and the nose down inputs were all pilot induced.
I don't know what the big deal is as it was a little sloppy, but it didn't hit hard.
As an admirer of pilots I have to say that was a horrible and irresponsible action taken by the Captain. That was a go around if ever there was one. That was a gamble with 200+ lives that turned out fine but could have easily turned out different
Wake turbulence
Would that be recorded as a hard landing by the black box?
Yikes, that looked like some crazy low level wind shear!
Oooo stop it! 😂
Another example of poor manual flying skills. The elevator push down seals the deal
Jerry, ABC News picked up your footage of the AA134 Rollercoaster landing on Wednesday!
It all adds to the excitement of flying. I once landed at LHR in a BA Tristar from Paris in a stonking storm back in the 80's. We used the 3rd runway that crosses the airport because things were so bad - not sure if it's still regarded as a runway. The landing was much like that in this clip. The plane's hold was full of Beaujolais Nouveau so the pilots were under strict instruction not to crash the plane. Must admit quite a few of the passengers were shitting themselves on the approach.
Interview passengers?
"Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Stop it" - Unlikely to have been said in the cockpit! 😂
Sneezed on flare?
Stop it. Ryanair lands like that everyday
Seems like a routine wild condition landing to me. There are 1000s of these on YouTube and 100,000s of these every year. So relax!
BBC news showed this clip earlier!
Hopefully ABC paid you big bucks to use this tonight.
left wing completely lost lift and threw everything out of whack. Wild stuff.
Totally clipping the sound bite and using it on my questionable landings!!
Pilot " is the landing gear ok " Landing gear " 🦗🦗🦗"
organism  ..wonderful
Any  landing you can "walk away" from..
I used to know a bird called Vicky vortex
keep the door closed capt
I'm pretty sure those pilots were 5 inches higher in their sits after that 😂
Can't wait to hear what @blancolirio has to say about this.
OMG
The commentary makes this video 10x better. 😂
Nose wheel first that's gotta hurt.   at least there was no wing tip strike.
Just saw this on my ABC National News here in the states.
Must be the diversity hire from United that bent up the 767 back in August.
Pilot will surely get a rollicking for that.   Awful to keep piling on thru after that drop and left wing dip.
What's insane is that the engine cowling on the 777 is the same diameter as many fuselages such as the DC-8!
O o o o while the plane is doing the macarena 😂😂🤣🤣
The pilots will be sent this video so they can see how insane it was
Big Jet TV made it onto the US National News with this video. That was a scary landing.
look at the controlsurfaces the pilots were doing a massive workout in there
Congrats Jerry and Gilly the  US  national news carried this clip on ABC. 👍🥂
I’ll take “things you can say in the bedroom and while plane spotting” for 400.. 😂😂
Pilot-induced oscillation, you could clearly see at 0:31 they overreacted and pushed full forward for a second but it was way too much and there was no way to compensate the accumulated rotation moment just a split of a second later.
Just saw this on the news after watching it, absolutely insane and must’ve been insanity trying to get it down, just surprised no go around after the left wing dipped that much
THAT WAS INSANE!!!!
Well your video made Nightly News here in the states on ABC.
Saw this on ABC nightly news Wednesday. Big Jet TV with the byline on the screen. Great job Mate!!
Wow! Just straight up, heart up in throat, wow!   Very glad they were able to finally land and nothing went more wrong.  Whooo!  Thank you for your program here.  It's always good hearing explanations and commentary from folks who know the industry. Bless your good heart.    Blessings... "Cap'n" Toni with my Pups Lady Coco and Miss Carly, in Spirit Lady Maya, and All the Animal-Kids of the lil Haus... Pennsylvania, USA....
Made ABC World News Tonight!
Im so glad everybody is ok, but the guy screaming sounds just like Horseshack from Welcome Back Kotter! 😂
@Big jet tv no you wont want to but is that the closest a plane as come to crashing you videoed
What runway were the pilots using and what were the winds?
wow
Horshack
Get someone’s cellphone video footage onboard so all screams can be heard 🤣😂 man what a landing ! pancakes with extra syrup for those AA pilots ! 😂 great job in putting that big bird down ! 🤩 - your video clip got great billing on American TV !!
The woman walking past, completely oblivious, sent me 😂😂😂😂
Great commentary 👍
One of the most crazy landings you have ever recorded absolutely insane .. 😮
😮 wow! Crazy landing
Pilot thinks he's playing MSFS!
Welp, time to launder the underwear.
There's gonna be a lot of laundry done after that one!
Camera guy may need therapy with the passengers 😮
Awesomeness! Well done to those pilots & to Jerry for always being there to get the best capture!!
I bet they were clenched
That poor nose gear.
I’ve just booked return trips from LHR to LAX on AA. Glad they’re a good airline, hopefully the weather will be better in March 😂
Who else has watched that a few times just for Jerry’s reaction 🤣🤣🤣🤣 “oh stop that!” like a carry on movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great job BJTV ❤
“My aircraft”.....😂😂😂😂
It's almost like being at the shows 😮
That was crazy I think my pants would have gone brown 😂 lol
Computer had it all under control....
the lady walking in the background missed the action
Ohh dear!  What a crazy landing - glad I'm on the ground n not on that!  LoL .  Koodo's to the Pilots ;) <3
"I didn't know you could fly a plane." - "Fly? Yes. Land? No!"
That was rather extreme, say what?!!!
Probably a triple vaxxed female at the controls so nothing to worry about.
Was captain asleep (sleep inertia)? TOGA!!
u uu uuuu ooh ooh ooh uuuh uuh oohhh wtf brow
Flipping heck.
That nose wheel took a major pounding.
Completely an own goal. The initial left wing drop is in response to a roll input.
Love this channel, the commentary is outstanding!
My wife would’ve passed out!
😂😂😂😂Jolly Good Show😂...From across the Pond..Bon Champ '24🎉
I heard this from the other room when the live was on earlier, glad I ran back to rewind 🤣
cool
Thought the guy commentating was going to take a heart attack if he was on that plane he would of frightened me as well 😂😂
well, that made me watch it a 2nd time.
it's a bit hard to go-around when you're airspeed is probably through the floor - courtesy of a nice micro burst.
The Britishness of your commentary made me chuckle. If that was Americans they'd be screaming "OH MAAAA GAAAAWD" over and over.
Just saw this on BBC
that lady literally had no idea what was happening behind her
OoOoOoOoO Windshear
Sounds like Jerry was walking on hot coals.....!😂😂Great catch, Jerry. Well done, sir.
You stop it!
Just appeared on BBC news
Classic British commentary
This clip made the main BBC news at 10 tonight, insane landing
55k views wow at 10.15pm same day lol😬🤪✈️
You said it “Oh My Goodness Me”
Blimey!  Shows the skills of the pilots here!!  👍👍👍💗💗
Pure big jet magic ❤❤
That was extremely scary just watching it through the camera. I can only imagine how scary it must have been for you watching it live and i can not even imagine how it must have been for the crew and passengers (if there were any). Edit: slowed it down and it seems to me that the left wing spoilers opened before the ones on the right wing just as the rocking motion started. Seemed like the loss of control was caused by the spoilers deploying asymmetrically
God the people on board that aircraft felt that hard.
This is what happens when an airline goes woke and imposes 50% female pilot in recruitment
Amazing catch! 😮
Holy Toledo
Oh such drama man…………😮!
Was it the pilot being super aggressive with the controls? I see a massive nose down input.. Maybe caught off guard?
Wow!!! Kudos to the pilots for getting on the ground safely!!! Spectacular Airmanship!!!
I guess when you gotta be on time you gotta be on time!
OMG is right! What frightening last few seconds of this flight from LAX must have been for everyone onboard!😮 My heart just about jumped out of my chest watching this. Excellent capture, Jerry 👍
Any landing from which  you can walk away is a good landing.
I'll bet "flippin' 'eck" was NOT what the pilots were saying!!! WOW what a landing!!!
He'll be getting a call from the home office for sure.  Lol.
Great show today
Actually caught this live! By the way, re "shed affect" that was being discussed around that time, you may want to look into Winkle Brown's experimental (intentional) wheels up landing in a Vampire on a suspended rubber runway. He put the somewhat heavy landing down to the final approach being between two hangers.
And they still don’t crash
🙃🤢
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES OMGGGGG
Brave personnel in the cockpit !!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's the most outrageous approach I've ever seen that hasn't resulted in a TOGA. Wind shear and shed effect at their most extreme
Good recovery he ( or she) was determined to land on the 1st attempt.....nice!!!
Maybe the difference between a military trained Pilot and Civilian Trained !!!  😉
That was a full left deflection for some reason that didn't seem related to the winds. luckily the actual touchdown was not super hard.
New trousers for the pilot please!
Matron stop it................................................
I feel 3 Minutes of Aviation coming
After flying all the way from Los Angeles to London, probably 10 hours, the passengers probably thought they'd bought the farm.    Holy cow.
do not watch this with the sound muted ... you need the full "oooh-oh-oooh-ooooh-oohhh-oho-ooohh stop it" .... effect... to go with it .... 😀
OOOOH OOH OOOH OOOH OOOH OOOOOOH OOH OOH OOOOOO OOH OOH OOH
Flipping Heck 🛬🛫🛬
Thanks for time stamping this, rough as guts 🤪
Brilliant work once again
I've just seen the BBC has this clip on the news homepage. More subscribers incoming I guess.
According to Flightradar, this AA134 did two procedure turns north of Heathrow on approach to EGLL before landing on runway 27 , so I'm wondering if fuel was running low, causing the pilot to proceed with the landing instead of breaking away for a go-around once they ran into windshear (or whatever caused the problem). Great newsworthy shot, Jerry.
This is one for the Books 2023 in review
Oh my goodness. I would love to have an interview with the pilot who made that landing..I want to know what happened? Was there a burst of wind..and she /he over corrected…how and why did this happen. I want to her 777 Pilot Juan Brown critique this landing
Great job, pilots of this American Airlines. Pilots in particular captains, are highly trained professionals, they know exactly what they are doing.
Just showed my other half and her response was "planes aren't supposed to twerk, right?" 😂
Wow
Was watching in a cafe and so many stared at me as if I was doing a male version of When Harry Met Sally, thanks Jerry!
Classic capture there Jerry!
My gosh  beautifully caught Jerry and fantastic job Pilot amazing composure on landing
I saw this live with u and seeing it now it's mad. He should have gone round that could have been big accident
That was nuts, true 50/50 do I go around or not? Going by the landing there was no way that crew was going to do a go around.
I watched from Memphis and damned near messed MY pants. Hope everyones back is ok.
Holy crap! I'd rather be lucky then good, sometimes. This was one of those times!!!
My office has a clean view of the runway and seeing this live was insane
The OHOHOHOHOH STOP STOP THAT 😂
Hats off to the Boeing engineers who designed the tough-as-nails nose gear.
credit to the american pilots controlling the plane really well
This made BBC news. GG GP and Jerry! Thanks for the great show as always.
Blancolirio the white courtesy phone please !
Whats the best viewing spot for Heathrow? Might pop over tomorrow if i get a chance.
0:26 sounds like someone entered Jerry and he wasn't too keen about it.
Windshear
Well done, that man...what a landing.
This landing made it onto BBC👌🏽
This also happened to a AC 777-3 a few weeks back at YYZ.  Pretty scary site.
How many seats had to be replaced? The pucker factor is really real!!! Wow
Holy moly. I bet the pilots didn’t open the cockpit door until all the pax had disembarked! 🤣
WATCHING THIS TODAY LIVE WE WERE ALL IN DISBELIEF 😂
That was just heart stopping.  Scary.
That was a rough one😮
You could see the trails in the air before it went pear shaped, it was as if a drunken sailor had his paintbrush out and drew instability in the airflow.
Does anybody know why he gave the left input it looked like he was on track to have a decent landing. Was he trying to touch the left landing gear first as some pilots do?
Jerrys reaction to this is fantastic.!
That Boeing did a real Boing Boing
how did didn't they do a go-around that was insane
Wow! That was ugly 😱🚨🚨
😮 Omg 🤦 omg . Well done pilot 🧑‍✈️ for landing that plane ✈️ well in the end that is.
LOL at the commentary. "Stop it! Stop that".  Like ok, I'll just stop that, whatever that is. haha
yeah lets do VREF+5? what dont add the extra? naah it will be fine
I don’t see the big deal this looks like a normal landing for me in the sim lol
Today was very bad, didn’t even bother putting cones around the plane as they would fly off the stand 🤣🤣
Oh the Joys of Long Haul flights and cross wind landings ✈✈✈✈✈
Are you straight out of the monkey enclosure at chester zoo 😂
Hope that wasn't Juan Brown at the controls!!!!
Classic commentary.
business as usual happy new year all
Just another day in the office for these pilots. They'd have had it all under control in the cockpit I'm sure.
That certainly tested the suspension 110% 😬😬
Blimey watching that made my heart drop to my stomach
Krass,irgendwann krachst ich hoffe aber nicht
The passengers must of felt that one. Crash bang wollop. Great video I caught the last 3 hours of the stream.
That was insane, round of applause to the pilot(s) who landed this American 🇺🇸 the sheer knowledge and skill they have and have acquired is phenomenal, especially in these insane weather conditions and all the cabin crew who kept everyone calm on that flight bravo 👏🏽 what a way to land in London Heathrow.
Jesus Christ! Go around man! They’re free!
buisness is usuly 😉
What's insane about that? Surely the lunatic shouting Oh Oh Oh but the landing looked pretty rational.
Even better on 2x speed😂
What was the flipping ???
Get me the hell off this plane is what id be yelling
No "flippin heck"?? Is everything okay? 😂
Madness how he managed to get that down, Jerrys reaction must be one of the funniest things i have ever heard, Ow , ow , stop that , stop that 🤣🤣
I got ten 'oohs' a couple of 'aaahs' one 'stop it' and a final 'stop that!' Good stuff
Phew. Holy moly. I Hope they checked for any buckling in the fuselage. That nose hit hard.
flipping heck, hold on a minute.....  confirmed
Amazing catch, I would be screaming if I was on this flight 😂
oh my word, I don't know why I thought that was a cargo plane. It's a flippin passenger plane. The chaos in the cabin. Yikes
If i got of that flight i would go straight to the closest airport pub to get some pints to recover from that.
Considering all things, that was a successful landing. Despite what it may look like to non-pilot viewers, sometimes we have to "stick" the landing to bleed off the extra speed (energy) we need to carry for these types of landings. In heavy crosswind landings, extra speed is needed to counteract the negative impact of wind. It looks scary and out of control, however, every pilot is trained to perform these landings. In the event of a low fuel situation, you may have no choice but to land, even in a high crosswind. @hvrijsse is absolutely right! In 36 years, I've never heard a box or package screaming in the back! Earlier in my career @ Delta, that was a different story! Lol (Of course it could have been because I was brand new pilot)
As a darts commentator might say..”I CAN’T SPAKE….I CAN’T SPAKE”
Bloody Hell!!!!,
Low-level wind shear is no joke
" Ooh, ooh , ughhh! " How was it for you ?
You are the best Jerry. I watched that live and was amazed at that landing. Check your shorts boys.
It looks dramatic and scary and it was surely not convinient for the passengers especially after a 10 hour flight but it wasn't dangerous at all. The landing gear of a 77W is constructed for expected rough landings. For me it seems like the wind wasn't responsible for that but a little stall due to the wind that slams against the plane and slows it down a bit.
👏👏👏🙈
This would have been such a great video if it weren't for the inane shouting. Dude, Merry Christmas and all that but please don't ruin your own videos like a third-rate amateur would do. Unless you're an eleven-year-old in which case you're excused.  Why? Because the shouting detracts from the content. It changes the video from an aviation video to a video where kids yell with excitement when cars go through floodwaters and stall. Those floodwater videos are hilarious but I go watch those because they're hilarious,  not because i want to watch something aviation-related. Know what I mean?😂
Time to change into your brown pants
Was watching this live when it happened, crazy!
Incredible!
Scream if you don't want to Go Around!😂
Wake turbulence!
Surprised they didn't go around!
That’s one big mf
Oh wow, that pilot really was superb to sort that out😮
A go around should have occurred
The Pilots and the Company now have a video of their bouncy landing.
This is how AA always lands as I can recall my flights with them. Or has smth changed since 2016?
Gosh Super Darn Scary 😮
OMG
Horrible landing with excessive control inputs. Right seater had his chance.
That's what you call a Code Brown moment
Yikes 😟 😦 😅😢😮🤢
Classic .
Oh Oh Oh..... Definitely an Andrex moment I reckon
YIKES!!!!😳
All this mess was pilot induced. Just look at control surfaces movement. Aircraft respoded to control inpunts and then we had PIO.
This is what happens when a control pumper is flying. That was all pilot-induced. Over controlling with excessive inputs for the conditions. Should’ve been a go-around.
Fantastic show today Jerry
I bet those pilots were clenched!
Watched this on the live 😂
No way that’s the flight I was scheduled to be on but my connection was late. Instead I was on another AA777 that you also recorded earlier
fresh under wear for all passengers
Insane! Great shot and glad it made it down.
Shocking landing 🛬
Guess he had to pay landing fees twice :-). Said that to a pilot after a bouncy landing once, he did smile.
I'd be one of the passengers in the back screaming we're all gonna die!
I'm so glad I saw this live...I've told everyone I know about this insane landing!! I'm so glad you've put the video up, Jerry!
Sounded like he was having a puppy or something.
Wow, just think of the carbon emissions!  Coming from the crew that is. 😊
After the first touch of the main gears the spoilers had deployed  (as designed) which dumped the lift off the wings, after that point, they had to land. Dramatic and not a landing the crew would have liked but all in a days work I’m sure!
Oh to have been a fly on the wall in that flight deck.
Well saved.
Just awesome  well done
The pilot caused this himself..... He activated the alerons on the left side, as you can easily see. It was going to be a smooth landing before that.
And people wonder why US airlines suck
All in a day's work...
🤣🤣🤣👌
No accolades for these guys. They almost killed everyone on board by not going around after a horrible event! The de-rotation and nose gear slamming first after bounce was extremely poor technique.
No idea if they were drunk or talking to each other. This should have been a go around and nothing else. I would fire them if this would be my plane and company.
thats a mother of instability at the last minute well caught jerry, and well done to the pilots for settling it at the end ...my my
Cool
Wow! That was a very insane landing. Hope everyone is ok.
"Mayday Mayday" - and it's only 27th December! 😖🤣
Looking at this several times now, the speed brakes had deployed on the second bounce making a go around impossible, they were committed to land, no choice.  Pretty sure if they hadn't they would have gone around, split second timing with such events, the pilots did a fantastic job despite what others may say, they saved that plane.
Holy molly, It definitely was pilot induced!     There was definitely strong crosswind at that time but hardly any gust and turbulence as far as I can tell!
The pilot has placed his balls on the co pilots lap 😂😂
Cockpit door stayed closed after that one 😂 “Are they all gone yet?”
Need this as a ringtone 😂
Kudos to the pilots for a spectacular landing 0:34
pilots are a dfferent breed, top class
My god…
That was the Bond flight…shaken, not stirred
Looked like a Juan Browne  blacolirio landing.
Wow
Ryanair Landing xD
Not sure what was happening behind the camera...  By the sounds of it, maybe I don't want to know.
It would have been a 200% go around... Flippi´n ballsy move fro the pilots to just drop her
That’s gonna get some views 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Happy landings.
😂😂😂😂😂 Jerry your reaction made me laugh but crikey that got a bit scary that landing
Pure skill by the pilot, keeping it under control,omg.
Wow! 🫣
You need to 18+ on the title.😂
Oh wow, crazy
holy moly , my hearty was in my mouth watching that, flipping heck
Insane landing. Just wonder how many fpm for that touchdown.?
Stop it, stop it! That's exactly what the poor passengers were saying!
😂 absolutely love Gerry’s reactions 👌🏻
Any landing's a good landing  ..but nose gear first 😬
Bet the passengers thought they were playing Buckaroo.  Pilots currently sitting in a bar downing a few to calm the nerves.  N719AN 11 year old 773 just about came a cropper.
Well the return flight should be delayed due to a gear and airframe inspection.  DOH
Hi, as a pilot in the same situation, I would have executive a go around rather than try to save the landing. Excellent job. You were very lucky.
Only Jerry gets this kind of footage
This was great to see live, thanks @BIG JET TV, you always get exclusives
Watch in 2x speed brilliant!
Saw it live! Absolutely incredible catch.
Imagine being a passenger and this is your very first flight.
It wasn't the vortex crashing down on you it was nearly the entire aircraft 😂
I'm gonna need your "Oooh oooh oohhh's" on a tshirt, thanks 😂
That's how you buckle fuselages, and write-off the equipment....yikes.
I can smell that from here
Anyone would think the runway was made of jelly the way that 777 was bouncing on it 😆
Jerry, I saw this on your earlier feed. Incredible recovery, man!!!😮
Brooo
Wow 😱
When you nearly say hello to your backside.😀
I undecided as to whether the landing or the commentry is the most entertaining
missed that  had to go out in the gales and get wet though  but glad you put in on thanks a lot bit like me on my flight simm 2020 ,have a safe new yr ron .gulliver
It's always better live. Subscribe and become a member folks
Jerry met Sally 😂
Well, that was DRAMATIC!!!  All's well that ends well!!!
Apparently the shops at the airport sold out of underwear.
Good the pilots where not that drama than the commentator 😅
Jerry's charisma makes this show.
wonder if there was any swearing in the cockpit taking place 😁things like " o deary me " lol
That was nerve racking and so glad I wasn’t a passenger. Great commentary on another great landing.
Nose gear inspection...
Oh oh stop it 😅😅😅😅 such a British reaction
Saw one similar here at CYYZ about a month or so agfo. If memory serves, it also was a 777! Caught live on a stream. Search Wake Turbulance Aviation. He posted a single of that as well!
I was watching the live Man, my heart was 🔥☠️
Wind shear + pilot induced oscillation. Should’ve gone around IMO.
Those passengers sitting at the back got a pretty much stomach churner
Holeeeeeee Moses!!!
another disaster prevented by skilled pilots
Was a big bounce there... , wonder what it was like inside....
😱😱😱😱😱. Bet there some clean pants needed
That's insane. I'm surprised they didn't do a go-around, especially when it was wobbling before the nose gear was down. Great effort though.
I hope that someone on the flight finds this video and comments on the landing - amazing work from the pilots!
For those wondering, the bird in question N719AN subsequently took off only slightly late on its onward flight to Dallas. Hopefully it was given a proper look over and clean bill of health first!
Wow
OMG!!!! .....you had to see it to believe it. That was nurve racking.   And wired.
OH GOD
If I was a passenger I would've had a mess to clean up in my seat😂😂😂😂😅😅
The triple is a tank, takes a lot more than that to break one.
The commentary always cracks me up on these
OMG😮😮
The elevators were all over the place.
I'm still clutching my Armchair
Crazy landing, great job by the crew 👍👍👍
Americano Rodeo.
Any landing you can walk away from, is a good one !
goodness me!!
Should never let AI land a plane 😂
What the actual
I think the pilot was in a rush for the toilet….not any more😂😂😂
That is insane with a capital I! Don’t think I’ve ever seen a 777 bunny hopping before!! 😮🤢 Amazingly captured as always Jerry! 👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼
It's one of the most craziest landings I've ever seen 😳
What the hell happened there !
You have to wonder the amount of force coming down on that front gear when he did that, hundreds of thousands of pounds on a single gear wow
You can see from the elevator movements that he was on the verge of pulling up again. 😲
Flipping eck 😂😂😂 I ain’t ever going on a ✈️ again 😂😂😂😂😂
I missed that because I went and got a snack when it was live 😭
Wow 😱
I have watched it back about 20 times from the live stream🤣Totally insane😱
why does Heathrow seem to have so many of these?
I took that flight in the past and I would not have enjoyed that landing!!!
OMG , that was scary 😶 I bet the passengers were shaken ! How did he get the nose down?
Every now and again a gust gets you at just the wrong momement !  Break out the free underwear .
As someone who regularly flys AA134 this would have probably put me off for life 😬
Holy crap!
I'm still amazed now that he managed to land and it wasn't a go around. Brilliant show today.
They were eager to get that down, hats off to them pilots 👏👏
the passengers inside must've got traumatized from that.
😂 Jerry makes it.
I hope they all had their safety belts buckled up tight.
Even better in 2x speed!!
Total hero, even the AP will buy the pilot a drink for that one
That was awesome!
Playback at 2x speed and Jerry sounds like he stepped on a hot coal😂😂😂😂
See, now all I can hear in my head is the chorus of "The Funky Gibbon"! If you know, you know 🐒
There will be a few needing a clean change of underwear on that one!!
That’s bananas!!!
The advantage of being a cargo pilot: no screaming in the back.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Sheer madness
Watched it live just assumed it was Ryanair lol
They should've gone arround.
Fantastic Jerry 👏 👍
Crazy landing that felt like a Ryanair landing 2.0
Home, warm, and dry; now, where's that triple seven clip?
Oh my 😮
This is one brave American Airlines Pilot 👨‍✈️
New underpants please 😂
I watched this live and I thought 'go around'  how did they land that'.  Wow.  Great show as usual BJTV
Runway’s a bouncy castle there! Definitely the highlight of the stream.
Wow great pilot skiils.
JERRY IS THE BEST!

HOLY GOODNESS! That was INSANE and the fact that it was not a go around 😮
Wow!😮 👍 ❤
Watched it at the time. Looks even worse now. Wow wow wow!
What on this runway went wrong. My heart was pounding😮😮😮
How the hell did they get that down? 99% of other pilots will have given it the TOGA thrust and go around
I am surprise that is not a go around
Mother Nature almost caught the pilot off guard 😮😬
