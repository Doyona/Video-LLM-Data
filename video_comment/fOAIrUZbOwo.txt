Divine. Not heard l’amour de ma vie before. I was wondering all the way through who’s zooming who. I like that. Kept me guessing until the payoff on the last line.  Can’t get enough of these two.
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Why does congress man Sam Graves of Missouri hates innocent Goth people. 😢
I knew you in another life, you had the same look in your eyes...
nothing better than genuine person
The carpenters of this decade
“Ao fundo da minha própria queda, encontrei um espaço onde ainda era possível respirar. E você me mostrou esse espaço. Não com promessas, mas com aquela forma silenciosa de quem sabe que a vida, às vezes, pede mãos invisíveis.” Eu cheguei quebrado — não só pelo amor que me negaram, mas também pelo mundo que insiste em me dizer “não” em todos os lugares onde tento existir. Você viu minhas rachaduras antes mesmo que eu soubesse nomeá-las. E em vez de fugir, ficou. Fez do meu caos um mapa, fez da minha dor um idioma que aprendi a traduzir. Hoje entendo: não é fraqueza sentir demais, é só a ferida lembrando que está viva. E se eu sigo caminhando, mesmo tropeçando nos meus próprios medos, é porque, de alguma forma, você me ensinou a acreditar que ainda há luz — mesmo para quem já se acostumou a procurar no escuro. Minha gratidão é grande, é densa, é a respiração que ainda não consegui soltar.
Interestibg person Billie with her brother!!!Nice
What a PERFECTION... She is awesome.
Fantastic 👏
Their brother-sister relationship is so beautiful! 🥰They seems twins born in different days, lolol. Make me remember my own brothers. We are very united, fortunately😊
9:29
Woooahhh😮😮😮❤❤❤
La adoro
She’s too good
Yall should have ace Enders on this show, he’s from the early November…excellent singer and songwriter
Nice to see performers who dress as though they respect their audience, rather than making a statement about their "individuality". But then, I'm an old fashioned kinda guy...
I love how Finneas looks at his little sister. What an amazing duo. God bless you all!
Tiny Desk never fails to have me spellbound
this feels very Joe Dirt,....
9:09 omg
Wow very cool. What a legend! ❤❤❤
centrelinks payees
they shoulda given  the guitarist a different guitar or soething that resonates a little more imo and maybe play to a click or try to really nail down timing with the vocalist
This video is gold.
The best version
This is so Beautiful.
not a fan but when you told Elon to end world hunger wow
Can’t describe how fascinating this is. ❤
"So sensuous between them?" 🙃🤔💠🫡
Sweet voice   It’s one dimensional, says c little  Billie sings:  “I love you.”  “I don’t love you”  “You love me”  “You don’t love me”  Insignificance. Repetitiveness.
WOW I AM SO GLAD I HAVE FINALLY HEARD BILLIE EILISH SHE IS SO PROFOUNDLY AND DEEP W A LOT OF LOVE AND PASSION I ENJOI’ YOU GUYS’S MUSIC SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR DUCH CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL MUSIC; LOVE-DIEGO H.❤
her voice is so beautiful
0:07  6:28 11:35 18:10
Excelente... ❤
Dude! I am liking this no bazz no autotune soothing human voice with a mere guitar and the real artist.  Man I am liking it.
Huge respect for Billie and Finneas being one of the few mega stars to do tiny desk without an 20 person entourage.
I love how he created her ... Yet he takes the back seat!...
Ground beef mixed with mashed potatoes vibes!...
definire questi ragazzi superlativi è dire poco...Billie è stata una rivelazione fantastica per chi ama la musica come me
That last song she was a little more relaxed. It sounded great!
the outfit is cool
Great voice
They're like the Carpenters 2.0
I just read that video description and it adds so much context and enhances the experience so much <3
Elegance
Please dont hate me for saying this. But im pretty sure that Billy's brother is her lover. As long as they dont admit it, and they dont have babies, its kind of cute
Como essa menina é boa!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏
Every single sound that comes out of her mouth while singing, gives me chills every single time. SO BEAUTIFUL.
The best part of this concert is the drummer! The way he hits the cymbal at 19:30 is like saying "I love you" over and over again. Every track he plays just the perfect amount and at the perfect place. Flowers to Billie and co, but the hero of this performance is Andrew Marshall
Essa mulher é incrível em qualquer lugar, mas a ideia de usar uma papelaria por mais aleatória que parece acrescenta um tom nostálgico ao que as musicas dela já tem naturalmente.
Respect to her for being able  to actually perform live. I thoroughly enjoyed this performance. Pop music is not really my thing but I do appreciate a decent artist and great performance. Kudos
❤❤❤😊🇧🇷
Not sure how many times I have watched this tiny desk but its my favorite.
🧡🧡🧡
nelen studio kali ya ini manusia
Hermosa voz.
excellent god bless
Can't say I like it
DIVINA!! ERES MÚSICA
Great choice of topic.
I really enjoyed this video.
Very polished video.
LN, for you From 11:10 to about 16:33
I wrote some acoustics songs on my channel. This channel is really cool. Much love!!
I still Love The Elishes😂😂❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
🌞
When they sing "The Greatest" is a big and strange genuine feeling that I don't know how to describe, but is just amazing the talent they have. Their voices combined are majestic and beautiful...
This is the best tiny desk o
Emozionante! Billie e Finneas sono assurdi, persone genuine, educate, ottimi musicisti, geniali! Billie ha una voce stupenda, e a questo format possono partecipare solo grandi artisti che riescono a mettersi a nudo Senza post produzione e artifizi...grazie per averli invitati
The way that finneas looks at her <3
She's not too bright.
no estaba deprimida y me deprimí. de todas formas. bellisima
To bad she is mentally deranged
Yawn
Preciosa voz❤
Every single tiny desk concert I’ve ever seen has been so very good.  I’ve never heard of half of the artists yet it never disappoints.   Thank you npr music ❤
fue el mejor regalo de cumpleaños 🎊🎊🎊
<3 so beautiful
My fav live ❤❤❤❤❤
❤ amazing voice
Impresionante
best voice instrument ever
Awkward much lol
The background music fits so well.
a mi novia le gusta billie eilish.. y a mi me gusta mi novia....
What happened to her lips? they are so strange looking and static...
I love her so much
Magic❤❤❤😊
... a wonderful to see siblings creating such a lovely songs... this should be called "Eilish Duo" in fact... 😊
T1ts
Who came here from Fuji Kaze tiny desk???😊
I love that she isn't wearing any makeup.
11:27 she could narrate a cozy movie
It’s a prayer
Paradise angel
Finneas is underrated
I don’t know but it looks like Billie tried not to cry mid ILY 😭 But then she laughs it off
Hard pass
Birds of a Feather....I just heard this song yesterday, and must have listened to it a hundred time already.  It really resonates.... and makes me think of someone I want to fall in love with.... there's a bit of an age difference, but I feel that she is "my person"
I Discovery now, I love you girl... ❤❤❤
how does the audience at tiny desk resist singing along aaaaaa 😭 i would be SQUIRMING
you favorite
❤🙏
Billie is a serial killer. She's got me several times over now. Like a siren.
Hi Billie

POWERFUL

This is an underrated channel.
Omg I’m so in love
omg the intro to love of my life! we want more jazzy billie! also btw look at those long mics...so crsip!
So beautiful when the concerts have no autotune. And Billie does them all that way. She's very good. And also Tiny Desk as long as i know, they never use autotune.
birds of a feather is a grammy winner not that diddy Beyonce mtfkkrs
Thanks for that beautiful voice and her musicians Billie
21:10 kinda a full circle moment i love you from i love you and i love u from birds of a feather
This was fun to watch.
This is absolutely horrendous. What's the joke all about?
My wife is so gorgeous
E inquietante billie...
Love the song birds of a feather
You always look awesome billie
I have always loved billie and Phineas (sorry if i spell it wrong)
Every time I feel sad i whatch this again
Dear my friends
Hermosa Billie .
Jeez man she's got Frank levels of recording-matching vocals live.
Her voice is so beautiful
Had no clue, She's that good!
máster piece
les vrais artistes passent sur Tiny DESK, si tu es pas capable de passer sur Tiny alors tu n'es pas un artiste , tu es  une IA
Her voice is coming from paradise
Puertorican 🇵🇷 born and raised in NYC Salute to eveyone watching ❤ this was a special treat.
What grows together goes together
❤
Wow, they really all went for that supply teacher look huh
What an absolutely wonderful performance. Let's not overlook Finneas' role in Billie Eilish's success, which is of course founded on a technical precision that was honed to perfection in the family home. There's something magical about sibling musical chemistry, based not only a shared genetic heritage, but the close proximity of multiple talents feeding off each other for years. In the case of the O'Connell household the unique circumstance that gives us this amazing performance wasn't only the usual musical background of guitars and pianos, but the incorporation of the laptop and an abundance of creative musical software. It was the technology that let Billie and her brother work the arrangements and sonic production into a state of lucidity that we've really never heard before. That's not to play down the sheer musicality of the duo (in either of their solo careers) but to go some way to explain why it sounds so sharp. It's been forged and honed and tempered in an intimate studio environment (their own home) that has led to the blossoming of what I would call an unprecedented musical and emotional phenomenon. [Let's see the AI invent anything remotely this good. Not just copy it badly, any old fool can do that. Invent it! No? Thought not.]
The second song.. Guys that was beautiful
In love again ❤❤baby.
creo que escucho este tiny desk todos los días
Every track feels like it belongs in my personal movie. 🎬
5 years ago I listened in on your first tiny desk/mock tiny desk. It made me a fan of you and hit me deeply. Some are destined for more and they share that passion with the rest of us. 👍
We want The Favors here 😊
Me encanta cuando cantan juntos,se escucha precioso
Divina como siempre
so very much beathyful voice angel
i love you has such a strong connection to me; I sang it Infront of my class in high school, and it took me to another space. I felt I was alone with the song, ugh, Billie and Finneas, you guys are truly artists
2025 here
She's great.
The sound quality is great.
wow wow wow
I appreciate the detailed analysis.
Well explained and structured.
You always bring value.
o que essa mulher canta é brincadeira, fenomenal!
all those artists who i made on my own version at everything are okay to download and use it
time goes and things change, i love making robots
9:09 “you made it so ✨hard✨
Not that I necessarily blame them, but young people are so depressed these days it's depressing looking at and listening to them.
👍🏼
The people that say "they don't get her boring whisper singing" listen to Taylor Swift lol ong
나의 빛, 나의 삶, 나의 모든것, 나의 여자, 나의 사랑, 나의 구원자,billie eilish
Wow Billie’s brother is so sweet
свепх заурядная девушка. абсолютно ничего эксклюзивного. Распиаренная на пустом месте. обычный голос, коих миллионы.
Great rhythm and beat!

I’m so thankful for Billie 🥺
very informative.
The production is top-notch.
❤
I love this! <3
I need to be her Baby's Daddy! 🥰
su voz es muy calida y expresiva, no destaca pero si atrae, la diferencia es que conbina una buena voz con la apariencia de un angel, entiendo por que tiene tantos seguidores, tiny desk revivio el unplugged por suerte
The production is top-notch.
Always enjoy your videos.
I never realized how amazing her facial expressions are while she sings a melody.  So expressive.  Makes me giggle a lot, shed a tear sometime, and always smile.
I don't know if she or her voice is more beautiful
Wow i never really heard her before but she sings beautifully and what a lovely smile
Rompió 😮
Well-researched and accurate.
Perfect song for my playlist.

Thanks for sharing this update.
4:6 🙃🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠💕
Had to click to see if she was legit... And I'm pleased to say that yes, she is...  I don't know if she writes anything, but her interpretations in this Tiny Desk seem to telegraph that she absolutely could.   I'll never fully sign on to "chosen artists", but I'm happy that she was chosen for a reason and not created for a purpose.
billie you r the graetest love u for every ever
Billie Eilish performed the following songs: "THE GREATEST" (0:05-5:51) "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE" (6:48-10:01) "i love you" (11:49-16:05) "BIRDS OF A FEATHER" (18:11-21:52)
I was fully not expecting to click on this and cry through the entire performance. So moving.
i'm crying😭 11:37
🤧🤧🤧
31 minutos Rules
Também fiquei com SAUDADES e  já não paro de ouvir
It is talent, Yes, It is luck, Yes, It is being there in right time. It's an alignment, either finds you or you find it. or just a life even ordinary. Billie is Aligned ⭐
"She had Billie eilish style"
I love Billie is very Beaty, sophisticated, glamorous…really she need the next Super Bowl 2027. Is most gorgeous ♥️

6:30 melhor musica 😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love the melody.
Excellent coverage of the topic.
I prefer tiny desk concerts to listening to the actual music
Very insightful reporting.
Brilliant work by the journalist.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I could watch this over and over again forever, such an amazing list of beautiful songs 💖
My biggest dream. Is to meet Billie. Hug her, melt into her, and cry. Then laugh.. her music means so much to me…. It’s a feeling that goes so deep? I just think she’s a beautiful talented women and I admire her… I don’t “fan girl” but when it comes to Billie she’s genuinely just Barr none hands down a raw talent
Very smooth delivery.
Im back again 😢❤
Excellent coverage of the topic.
얼핏보면 문방구같은 공간이 너무 좋으네

This is exactly what I needed.
Just 1 more beat
Will roses bloom?
Uufffffffff
Wow, tiny desk, big feels!  Well done all!
Billie’s voice feels like a cashmere sweater and a cup of hot chocolate on a cold evening ❤
You are not "going girl", you ARE girl. Enough with this madness.
this really shows how her vocals have gotten even better over the last years
The production is top-notch.
Well explained and structured.
Very insightful reporting.
Great rhythm and beat!
She’s adorable when can I marry herrrr
Very insightful reporting.
This song is amazing!
This is a masterpiece.
Having ads play in the middle of songs has got to go. Have some respect for the human spirit.
She sounds a million times better without all the autotune.
Music class studying in another room while we watch the Dead Poet Society literary section

Good journalism!

Great article
This news is well-written.
Никогда особо не смотрел разные песни и певцов, но послушав эту девушку как она поёт однозначно талант от Бога!🕊👍❤
Love you both! Billie & Phinneas! Such a great artist you are! Loved this Tiny desk!
I CANT UNHEAR HER SOBBING IN I LOVE YOU
🖤🖤🖤
This piece is very helpful.
Sounds amaizing❤❤
Thanks for sharing this update.
Clear and concise writing.
6:27❤️
this songs called i lo-" aaand im sobbing
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Am I the only one who thinks every instrument was too loud during "birds of a feather"? You can tell billie was struggling to match the volume of her voice to the band's volume and it all sounded kinda off. Wish they would've mixed it better cause the mixing was perfect for all the songs except for when it came to birds of a feather. Im sad they "ruined" such a beautiful song. Of course it still sounds amazing cause it's Billie but the instruments were way louder than her voice
Everyone talking about the way Finneas looks at Billie but can we talk about the way the pianist looks at her? That man is IN LOVE
Her face when she said "but you were not mine" at the end of L'amour de ma vie and everybody laughing 😂 was so cute and funny ♡
It’s nearly perfect, but they let so many bands use electronic stuff… cut out any DJ related stuff and cut out the autotune vocals please
What a Voice! Girl, can you sing! So Talented!
Heatmaps in YouTube Studio highlight most rewatched parts
I think you know this by now but you’ve got the shine, so go light up the world with minor notes.
Your dedication is inspiring.
for billi elish my reconocement for the beautiful music ,they made😊😊😊😊
Her voice hits hard and soft at the same time
Boring!!
The harmony is wonderful.
pleeease bring us Lola Young now!

I though this song was that Sabrina girl! I’m so happy it’s Billie song!!!!!! 💙
11:37
yo la amoooooo                                                                                                                                                                                               :)
I used to love Billie, I never stopped but I kinda just stopped listening to her music due to the phase of life I was in. The first song brought me to tears 😭 so much emotion behind her voice
Commentaries that balance critique and positivity perform best
loved
in tearsssss
❤ 1:13
She looks so feminine
Why are the most talented people the most simple and easy going ?
the way finneas' voice blends so well with billie's omgmfdffmfgf i loveeee
Just goosbumps❤❤❤❤❤ i love them sooo much
No offence intended but guitar letting things down
This is a joke. Average musicians with high media presence think they’re impressive, and the real problem is that people pay to listen to them, making them rich. Meanwhile, genuinely talented musicians often struggle financially.
Her singing voice is beautiful ❤
love her shes so amazin she save my life love u billie and hers songs are pure magic and all of them break my heart
always visit back <3
Exceptional talent, thank you for all your work
que fenomenal que es!
What kind of microphones are there? Who knows? Vocal.
u are my life
I love gut wrenching hauntingly beautiful music. Billie the woman you are 🖤💋✨
Humor, relatability, and honesty are the commentary trifecta.
Outrage can drive clicks but erodes trust�use sparingly.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
18:00 my favorite ❤
Minimalist thumbnails can stand out in cluttered feeds.
I can't do nothing but clap 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Job extremely well done!
😂 my dad is this Billie Ellish? No it’s Olivia Rodrigo lol
Super 😊😊😊
an ad... ok but IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREATEST OUTRO.... what the heelly
SO TALENTED
Very well put together.
💗💗
So unusual for them to use this kind of microphones
Angel voice love you
So peaceful.
Please invite Ritchie Kotzen for the channel!
are you rersponding some things that i said
J'adore le petit regard du pianiste a 18'34 😊
Saw her in the pit at the oasis concert recently and say how much I enjoyed this preformance. 🤘
Gifted and blessed!

A wonderful creation.
Like her stuff or not, listen to that first song to realize was a talented singer and song writer she and her brother are. Like many (most?) she's made the $ and fame with her pop stuff, but actually has real singing and writing chops too!
What's the name for the firs Song?
I learned the Birds of a feather song when they played it at the little girl funeral Jocelyn Nungaray 12 yrs old - she is the little girl who went to the corner store here in Houston at 11pm at night and snuck out and ran into 2 illegals and you know the rest. But they played several of her songs at the funeral and I never stopped listening to Billie she can really sing and all of her songs are hits.
allelujah?
Reaction mashups showcase community perspectives.
This is going to go down in history as one of the best tiny desk performances, she killed it
This was absolutely Amazing and brought back that certain 70's vibe. How TV 📺 used to be interacting with the Artists. All kinds of Talents. That's where I see BILLIE EILISH now and forward ,Her Career it's just taking off. Love this for Her and FINNEAS Her Brother. Love you guys ..💙
nope. nope. nope.  rock out billie :)
nope
no
nahhh girl.
the best whispering singer
I'm back for another listen
SHE IS NOW THIN AGAIN? When did that happen?
Fantastic 😮‍💨🤧 I love hearing her and her brother together so much. Beautiful ❤
<3
1 minute in and theres a new found respect
Extremely bland and dull.
6:27
Event highlight reels perform best within 24 hours.
Anyone know if they have monitors?
I found your definition of saudade perfect, Billie conveys exactly that, a melancholy, a nostalgia or longing for something loved, but absent...
for you billie🌹
I'm almost 60 years old and find (her) their music magical.   It really is transformational and gives me hope for future generations . . .
just WOW.
Drag lypsinc
I realize this isn't  the  80's any more or even the 2000 's  . Ticket prices have gone  sky high since I was a kid. I wouldn't  pay $300 a ticket to see GREEN DAY  OR  MATALLICA & THOSE. ARE MY FAVORITES. WHO'S I  CHARGE OF SETTING THE TICKET PRICES? DON'T YOU MAKE WAY TO MUCH ALREADY?   THATS RIGHT IF TICKETS WERE $100. CHEAPER THEN YOU WOULD BE MISSING OUT ON   $ 200 K  ON TOP OF THE $400K YOU ALREADY MAKE  FOR A 4 HOUR VENUE. THATS REDICULESS!!!

16:52 that guy’s eyepatch is so COOL
Bendito seja o petróleo, do qual foi extraído o diesel que abasteceu o caminhão que transportou o concreto da construção do hospital que essa mulher nasceu❤❤❤
This performance by Tiny Desk and FujiiKaze is too much of a treasure!
Not a big fan of current artists or the recent past for that matter but this young lady is absolutely brilliant.
te amo Billi
Are his drumsticks Spaghetti?
He cannot sing. He should be quiet while she is harmonic. If messes her voice up when he tries to take some credit
Strong intros with creator presence build trust early
The detail is amazing.
Really a special angelic voice. Touches the soul 🙏
Ouch
Creator �starter packs� help newcomers binge efficiently.
Luckily She Lost All That Weight To Be Able To Fit Behind That "Tiny Desk".  🤫
Love is amazing she’s such a beautiful soul I’d give anything to meet her
And she looking healthy again.
Fineas needs to go an octave higher they sound beautiful though
I appreciate the clarity.
Long-form podcasts are gaining traction due to multitasking habits
Love u brother
Your brother will protect you. It's what we do. !!
I hate that you are WITH.  NPR.
So pure. Your are special!!
please have Peach PRC on 😊
Agora entendo perfeitamente porque tanta gente curte ela. Que voz incrível! ❤

Holy FCK how did she did a contract to "sing" ?!?!?!?
Sound like stray cats.
I didn’t know I liked Billie until I heard this on auto play and didn’t know who it was. 😂❤
I didn't know that Finneas could sing.
Curated playlists act like guided tours through a niche.

Nice drum pattern during the first song.

this song shouldn't be minimized to a lower vocal tone to fit the tiny desk studio.. it's loud and monumental and passionate.. it needs a STAGE.

The best thing about Tiny Desk concerts is that you can experience the musicianship, the artistry and the humanity of the people whose music you enjoy. The best thing about this particular Tiny Desk concert is that you can actually hear Billie Eilish sing, and Phineas sing, and the band play their instruments... all without tens of thousands of people singing and drowning them out. ;-)
I need cardibb tiny desk
Game launch trailers generate intense but short-lived interest spikes.
Real-world events rejuvenate older content topics.
A/B testing thumbnails with community feedback is effective
Excepcional!
Love that in these versions, Phineas is so much more audible, it really adds something!
Red wine Supernova was so f****** good at the end the energy was amazing the whole song was amazing but at the end I was like Goosebumps
💙💙💙
❤❤am Dominican and she is my idol ❤
I feel so bad for the ones who don't get billie.
OMG this is HIGH LEVEl believe me
Great discription text for this video. Everything here is perfection.
Já tomei tanta cerveja ouvindo esse acústico. 😂😅
John Snow and James Mcavoy??😂
.... Um.... Her voice is so good raw and live like this. Greatest brought me to tears 😭
Indeed you are the greatest

Facts.
She's so frickin' talented, and w/her bro....
I paused my music for this and it was worth it.
What do you think they should do next?
Definitivamene en este Tiny Desk, Billie Eilish demuestra que tiene un enorme talento y una voz única!
I wanna hear her over some alchemist production. Dunno why I just think it would be cool
Yesss.
I’m definitely coming back for more.
Loved the energy in this video.
Well done.
Honestly, the music here feels very special and heartfelt
Love this energy.
Bravo!
Legendary.
Needed this.
I’m impressed.
Cute
can we please get  Miranda Lambert or  Hailey whitters or  Alessia cara or ruth b
Well said.
Finneas did a good job too. 😊
im tryyyyying myy besttttt
Pure quality content right here.
So good!
Exactly.
Billie sings with her heart!!! ❤
18:11 is what I come daily to listen 😭❤
You win the internet today.
藤井風のファンです どんなもんかと軽い気持ちで見にきましたが、 かっこいいの一言です。 圧倒されました。 横浜に見に行けばよかった 反省です 次回機会があるといいです🎉
Did anyone else rewind that part?
Bravo!
I’ve never clicked “like” so fast.
На столько круто поёт, просто крышу сносит! Очень талантливая  девушка.
Epic.
Chris brown singing (CRAWL, DONT judge me, with You) in the acoustic IT would be awesome
CHAMA O Chris brown pro tiny desk
Who’s rewatching this already?
Quiet
I came for the thumbnail, stayed for the content.
She's so terrible.
I can’t unhear the “BHEards  Uf a hEAther We Uhlh Tick Toghter”😭😛
This is what YouTube was made for.
so crazy
15:05 😂😂😂😂😂😂 biLliEeeeeee
What do you think they should do next?
You deserve every bit of success coming your way.
I actually learned something new today.
Iconic.
Your editing skills are insane!
Anyone else?
I’m definitely coming back for more.
Well said.
the greatest ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
my ears just came.
I WISH she was my girl <3
She sings to the deep inside of listeners' soul.
Beautiful to see how she camouflages her wisdom in song. By my regard, Billie is Eternal.
I find her music too one-sidedly quiet and she likes to croon her way through all the songs. What she sings she does very accentuated and vocally well. But I don't think she's a super artist.
You deserve every bit of success coming your way.
I can t stop smiling watching this

can someone drop the piano score for that part in the greatest 😅
That vibrato at the end of "i love you" is just a 10/10
4:01 was sooo smooth
Legendary.
Always relevant, emotions, human feelings. I love it!
The Tiny Desk Concerts are one of the reasons I am a sustaining member of my local NPR station. Long live National PUBLIC Radio! RogerC 8/14/26
The sister / brother delivery is beyond outstanding! I cried.
Ellie é você?
This looks better than restaurant food
Aaggh I LOVE HER SOO MUCH ❤
This is beautiful, thank you! I appreciate you sharing breathing practices and focusing on an impactful savasana instead of rushing through the end.
こんな優しいお兄ちゃんが欲しかった
So boring!!!!
Very nice voice
Her voice makes me want to cry, I can’t even explain it. She’s so effortlessly beautiful in so many ways. Singing is just one of them!
Billie's alright ! another great set on Tiny Desk ♥
Nice one.
can't believe it's been 8 monthsss. idkk  i looooooooooooove this performance
🇯🇵日本で待ってます❤
Omg 🥺🥺 Billie has the best vocals
Yo viendo esto mientras 💩💩
5:51
Drop a like if you agree.
you need 'Parcels' to do one of these trust me
Her songs open the door for you, pick you up from your room, put you in between the wilderness and makes you breathe.
Instant classic.
The first time I've watched this performance, I didn't know it would become a routine. Incredible music, chills every time ❤️
Still not over this.
Hermosa!!! Tu talento me hace llorar!!!❤
Most underrated TD concerts. Hear me out. Justin Bieber Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus.
There is no Billie without Fin!_
I would never pay to hear that average, boring voice in concert. It’s not surprising how the greedy promoters can convince the sheeple that this is amazing talent. It’s the complete opposite.
Impeach Trump otherwise sessions like this won't exist.
The Brother one your way Finneas i see.
Perrhaps THE most talented young singer/composer to come along in decades.  I've been listening (and playing to) music for 70 years, and Billie is about the only one of recent who is quite entertaining while fully clothed.  Many others of this era have to take most of their clothes off to try to capture and hold your attention.  This is TALENT!
feelin like billie
I just don't understand (until now) people who says she CAN'T sing like whuutdafuuukk are you DEAF or something???!???
Второй раз? Ну ок(
See you in November!!! Taking my daughter to see you❤
Amazing Billie 👏
When music makes you shed a tear specially coming live from someone as talented as Billie, ufffff what a voice the tiny desk is epic!
What a talent ❤❤❤
Billie & Finneas give me so much hope for the music industry. In an age of talentless photocopy “artists” these two are the real deal. What incredible and beautiful talent they have. Love you both and thank you for the beauty you create together.
I absolutely LOVE you!!!! I use to sit in my basement listening to your music crying when I first found out my husband was cheating!!! 21:53
No matter how many people hurt me I still love them very very much!!! Just from a distance 😔🫶🏻 13:58
Wait… why hasn’t Finneas done a solo Tiny Desk?! I love seeing him with Billie, but he’s such a talented artist on his own too. NPR, we need a Finneas solo session!
talent and creativity ! nice one .
Billie + Finneas = Epic
She arguably has the best voice in the world. Others don't even sound this good with auto tune. Billie is something else 🤍
the best channel ever, i wanna see James Arthur pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
bushy brow sensei
This is scarier than most movies tbh
Voz incomparável e incontornável.
It is Amazing. Both  Billies' voice and the dying NPR. THANKS!
I can imagine how much she struggles to sing, regarding the faces she makes while singing
Beautifully angelic!!
no autotune no justice
This young woman seems to have had her heart touched by an angel. Who could even break her heart. She has lived this as I guess we all must do. Why she has not been recognized as a super star that she is.
SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!
Watched all the tiny desk she has a weak voice. It's good but weak. Don't tell me you didn'y crank volume to hear
!!!!!!!!!! Ты великая
Like eating glass  Helicopter Bluest light  Banquet This modern love
Me being late to billie eilish but now obsessed
Te amo
Super talent.
Is there any questions,
No me agrada nada nada su personalidad, pero su voz es increíble
Dormir ouvindo isso é bom demais
she  looks like a private school girl ...lol so cute
Bilie parle si bien 😊 J'admire ses partages  Et sa voix ❤
Her voice is so beautiful!!! ❤
wow...what a beautifully stunning voice ❤
15:38 the way finneas gave her that proud big brother stare
La voz de Billie es oro… los hermanos son súper talentosos. Da placer escucharlos
Take my soul Billie…
Great music to fall asleep to.
BIllie is simply fabulous.    And Billie and Finneas are fabulous together.      Love them both.

Woao Billi canta super bonito es como chill jeje
Billie ❤… u have the voice for a Jazz album
Criminal putting an add mid chorus
I am 58 years old and a longtime Bowie fan. But this music is so pure and emotional, that I am completely overwelmed
I love her ❤❤❤
Never really listened to any of her music. WOW! What an amazing VOICE 😮❤❤❤ What a gift!
This woman is an ageless supernova
Love it
These two are unreal! GOAT. The band is great too.
Billie is crayz🤍😍🥺
Perfect
Who here was a fan from ocean eyes before she was a superstar?
She's so gifted
This baby deserves the world 😍
"อิสเมีย" 55
yuk. she must have millions of fans because this is what its like to point a camera at nothing...
No me gustó mucho. Siento que es uno de esos casos que el estilo no le sienta al artista.
هزاربار میتونم گوشش بدم🥲❤
زیباترین چیزی که امروز دیدم😭😭😭
Really special
jesus amado, que iss?????????????????????? maravilhosos
She is simply amazing. The soul in her, and her brother, is just oozing out of every note. I believe the best singer/songwriter team since Brooks and Dunn. I'm 67 and have loved all the female vocalist /bands thru out the years from Streisand, J. Joplin to Patti Smith, Deborah Harry and now Billie. She is probably one of the few performers I would pay to see, but it would have to be with less than a 100 people setting.
Такая довольная и красивая, как ни на одном большом стадионе )
6:27 O M G . . .
hearing i love you at the tiny desk was something i didn’t know i needed. i can die peacefully
Sara said that the regular version sounds better because of the really loud guitar part in the original that is infact not loud in this version. Just passing this on, I thought it sounded great. Thanks
Please, excuse me, “real” Billie fans! 🙏🏿 But, since I don’t usually listen to this “genre” of music. I forget that she can REALLY sing!! Like, not just a “great writer”! Or just very “marketable”! She has a REAL VOICE!!! I’ve heard SO MANY girls, singing, that became “popular”, that COULD NOT SING!!! Like, I know a BUNCH of church kids who could TEAR these “stars” APART!!! Anyway! I’m just here to say I’m pleased! She’s not just a pretty face! She has IT!! Congrats to all who know the music and gravitates to it!
I'm so loving this person and fin is great back vocals may I ring you in the future again super person you are..❤❤❤❤
God, she has such exquisite pitch and such wicked breath control. Her music is highly rated but she's a criminally underrated technical singer.
Acho que eu já assisti tanto a esse vídeo que já sei o que rola em cada segundo rsrs
So much sincerity in her voice ❤
Billie eilish is me me is her us 2 worlds collide
6:27 that was actually an insane performance
I was listening to NPR today.  They were talking about AI generated music.  I don’t remember his name, but he gave Billie as an example of music that AI can’t create…   Yet
wow
The truth this first song sings…. I’m overconfident.
Bass player looks like he is in junior high school.
Usual slock of unralented rubbish. No soul power at all.......
I love her beautiful voice. It’s very therapeutic for me…
mamasita
8:06 the best moment 𖹭
Eres N Token tocas el bajo!
I love her voice fr ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
The harmony is insane
I cannot explain how much I LOVE this set list.
Finneas is the glue . The base . . She is because of him .
I love her voice , so relaxing ……
she beautiful asf ->_.
I 😢
Billie 🥺😍😍😍
"I LOVE YOU " OMG😢💔
❤
18:10
A Pop Star who actually has talent. Forget, Taylor,  JLo, Beyonce, Katy frigging Perry who is doing her best Ray Gun the Aussie breakdancing impersonation in her shows. Billie and Fineas at keast write their own songs, sure they flesh her out with Producers, but at least the lyrics are real, not made up.
Tiny desk sound guys have it to beyond  excellent!
Their parents can be proud not only because of their children's success, but also because of the love and respect they show each other.
Esoo ❤
This is beautiful
Who else is here before this blows up
Increíble que no haya ganado el Grammy.
And what microphone did Billie sing into? I can't find any information about this.
Ocean reflection like desert. Sail at night.
I have blue,green,gold eyes. North to before desert. Desert is browngoldblack
Billy: recharche eye color, white skin gets burned fast in sun, blue eyes get blind fast in sun!
Anybody else hearing 'Sarias Song' from Zelda?
Finneas is such an incredible human/ anchor for billie. The little suttle ways he comforts her and grounds her back into herself. Especially when shes feeling nervous/ overwhelmed. ❤
ฉันเอื้อ
Is it just me or finneas was out of tempo on the first song? Or is it really like that on original song?
those harmonies give The Civil Wars vibes
great job NPR supporting the arts!! love you all!
I thought I was in a little room with Billie, then the crowd roared! 🤣.   Love it, Billie’s voice control is perfection. ❤
1st time I listen to her- Man, SHES GOOD!
This is my favourite video on the internet 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I confess that I'm not a big fan of Billie Ellish but at tiny desk she really won my heart! I've already heard it many times and it's wonderful track to think on life! Try it.
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes

how sleepy this music is.. 😴😄
Excellent . The AD timings are not great though.
One of the few who I pray did not get corrupted in any way by Hollyweird. She’s so talented. ❤
She makes me cry
For Billie Eilish to do a tiny desk concert speaks volumes to her love of musical vulnerability, expansion, and expression. Way to go girl!
Her singing style has some tinge of the oldies style.
18:44
❤ Love love love ❤
She was 16 he was 21??????  Sounds pretty sus to me
absolute insanity, phenomenal angel art and voices
i'll be the hero of the time  00:04 - THE GREATEST 06:26 - L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:36 - i love you 18:10 - BIRDS OF A FEATHER
I love that she says she's always wanted to do a tiny desk but I think this is like her third time doing one.
4:13 is so beautifully insane
Voice of an angel, rock on Billie and Finneas!
Billie 💔
🤍
15:07 I always wonder if that laugh Finneas gives out is because Billie was obviously struggling with some mucus in her throat and was about to lose it and pulled it back and upped her vibrato after 😆
BOAF ACOUSTIC IS SO GOOD OMG
"Sorry my voice is so f*cking quiet. I'm nervous!" Person from the crowd: "Good!" xD  *meanwhile Billies voice wonderful as ever*
Hi ... Billie. ❤❤
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My love ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
te amo muchísimo
... very-very well done (all of you) . I really enjoyed that.  🤔🤗
You really get into a song, and then - commercial.
Simply amazing 🔥 🔥 🔥
Know.
Thats so sweet🥹
God is cruel when he randomly blesses voice talent.  Billie is a bad role model and overall pathetic person but her voice talent is off the charts.  Lucky her or she would be a cashier at Wal mart and really know what sadness means
Billie eilish
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Божественно 🎉
creepy guitar player
I actually want my time back.
Yep
I love you tiny desk but 20 ads in the middle of when she’s singing!? Bye
Thank you NPR. Please do Chris Brown.
Dang!!!  22mil??
She is a once in a life talent!
What a heartbreaking voice!
SO much  talent!!
wow
great music quality even in a tiny place
I'm still here <3
Good voice❤
that's so beautiful and touching! sending all my love and good energy ♥
TOO  SHORT FOR THIS BEAUTY!
Why the piano man look familiar? Is he in a band?

Talented woman
This was great. Shout out to the whole backing band. I love watching musicians having a fun time
Loveu
Billie, I can’t speak…..
No hiding behind the desk in this one, fab skills
Anyone here in 2025??
<3
OHH God i can't stoop watching this Videooooo ❤❤ I loveee uuu Billie so Much 🤍🥇
Have you ever moved the speaker to your heart!! So your heart can hear and remember that it matters and you see it! 😢❤❤❤❤❤
Crazy how acoustic versions are almost always better
Is that Billies brother on the guitar? I'm new to her
Billie must please come to south africa this lady is saving lives and we thank you for that
❤❤❤❤❤
bird of mother hhii
❤
Great stuff - congratulations one my favorite #1 song 2025!!!
Putting 'birds of a feather' after 'i love you' is absolute genius.
Magnifique!
How I love u it’s no normal girl…
Just when I thought she couldn't get any better...I guess I forgot about "Tiny Desk" for a mo...  🤷‍♀️
Her falsetto on Birds of a feather is beautiful...
i lovee the all days you sing and i dont know why im love cry i love cry
i wanna a quick perfum
i want will be your someone give-me a chance to aprendice english or spanish
billie you have so much perfect face and simple's beautifull body
your brother have a cute face to make movies and u are so georgeous too
i just smile with you in a picture of my blue monitooor
The way the brother look at her!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ omg, sweetest thing ever
Love Billie
Her voice makes me stop and listen and feel it and I cry all the time listening to her. Even regardless of the words, just her voice makes me cry
That tinkling subtle piano is very beautiful. This whole thing is fantastic! Such impressive musicians.
This intro was so very beautiful. What a intertwining of Souls❤
Billie will go down as one of the greatest live singers of all time. No question..
💞💞💞Thank you💞💞💞
yo😮
18:15
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
That lip makeup is on point
el grupo de los ojos cerrados.
la gente de colombia que escucha a billie estamos bien ok
With 11 million subs maybe you don't need tax payer funding 😮😮😮
Ok, maybe I shouldn't be so judgemental of her....
It must be awfully difficult to sing your best  At 22
I want to be a musician too... I just don't hate America enough
Is it me or is the love of my life prove her lies...❤
Alright...her vocals are already pissing me off. She's a robot right ?... it's the old story, how can someone so young sing the blues ?...
Pero amiga, ¿cómo vas a empezar con The Greatest? 😭😭 Mi corazón de pollo no aguantó 😭
the pianist and percussionist got me
"The fear of falling" in love, Ms. Eilish.
I love you, Billie Eilish ❤❕️
I'd never seen these before just, wow.
Бесподобно ))
I agree with the response about this album not receiving a Grammy - it should have because the craftsmanship/artistry was brilliant. But you know, the music and Billie's vocals are in this 64-year-old's heart, and that is what matters. Tiny Desk REALLY does an excellent job of exposing true artistry. Can't hide behind an over-produced world. Many thanks to Maggie Baird and Patrick O'Connell for raising such gifted, beautiful people. And I applaud the family's work with the unhoused in LA. 💕
it's so perfect
anak ai88ng gu77dang ai888ng e333ta bago999ng
The bond billie and finneas have warms my heart in so many ways. I loveeee her
Finease is a great brother
miss u Warita
Eu fico hipnotizada ❤
She doesn't need backup singers she only needs her brother 🥹♥️
Does anyone know what acoustic guitar finneas is playing in “the greatest”?
Billie Eilish's my favorite singer.
so obsessed with this harmony 4:40 THE VOCALS R CRAZY
3:46 HOLY FINNEAS VOCALS WITH BILLIE OBBSEDSED
I was put off early Billie Eilish by her image but have just discovered her through Birds of a Feather, what a voice ❤
Y'all nailed it
last song was fukin great
她現場演出和錄音一樣完美，真是太有才華了！期待未來更多精彩！
teamobillie🥺
Gosh i can't handle this, so amazing
Es increíble como puede regular su voz de esa manera!
cool
The fact that in "i love you" she sounded like she was gonna cry just shows how much she can still relate to herself from 7 whole years ago <3 ❤
Thee spear
Eu até estava com saudade de você ô louca do Kabuki❤❤❤❤😅😅😅😅
What a bunch of weirdos
So pretty,
man, is she the greatest.
Muchos Aplausos.
Beautiful band b t dubs.

I knew Billie’s voice was amazing, but this pure quality is something else
The amount of control she has over her vocals is something I've always admired about Billie. I aspire to sing as well as her.
how do i enter a tiny desk concert? i'm a musician from bandlab
какая же Билли красивая здесь
все старые жопы, которые говорят , что молодежь ничего не может -привет, оставацтесь в своей попе
какой же я зануда, но тут у меня нет никаких вопросов, девушка поет, на нобелевскую премию
мне кажется, что барабанщик не понимает в чем дело...
я в 55 просто ахудеваю, от способностей этой девушки...
😍🥰🥰😘
So enjoyable!❤
Jeez, I know that Billie has one of the most beautiful voices ever, but I'm stunned again every time. Just imagine her writing a perfect wedding song. I would be crying walking down the isle for sure. So incredibly beautiful!
So talented I’m watching again
Crazy!
Not a Billie fan, but her voice and songwriting is awesome.
Her muaic is perfect for these tiny desks, its so intimate
THE GREATEST!!
so much respect and love and admiration for this performance - sending ilomilo (but not in a weird way haha, I'm in a loving relationship - your music has just meant a lot to me in the darkest moments of my life and it helps to revisit sometimes)
Better than studio
Immediately got chills, so beautiful
The description of this tiny concert resonates with me... That's why, after a long time ignoring this artist, I fell in love with some of her songs, like "Wildflower" or "Birds of a feather". By the way, we named our new cat "Eilish", mostly because our cat have one eye damaged, so instead of Pirate we'd use one of the other names of Billie.
my armhairs are standing pin-straight, Billie's voice is INSANELY goood and her control over it is breathtaking
TRACKLIST:  0:06 - The Greatest 6:27 - L’amour de ma vie  11:36 - I love you  18:10 - Birds of a feather
She’s so talented 3:56 😭😭😭😭
❤
I wonder how tiny Tiny Desk actually is...
the audio is so crisp thank u tiny desk
Such a good album I love the greatest
She is adorable, I love her so much.<3
these vocals are SO insane, she is so insanely talented oh my goodness
The ads are so poorly timed here
Hermosa voz ❤❤❤❤
TRACKLIST:  0:06 - The Greatest 6:27 - L’amour de ma vie  11:36 - I love you  18:11 - Birds of a feather
Love it. Let’s keep NPR going. I hear Trump wants to get rid if it as well as PBS.
what a talent! Billies voice is just so smooth and angelic
i wish i could push the like button more than that.. from past to eternity my girl, so much love to finneas tho
1:07 omg the harmony
Que ep lindo ❤
💙🎵😊

HELLO BROTHER OF BILLIE. YOU SINGLE I SINGLE LET'S COUPLE
I saw Billie on tour a couple of years ago and she was absolutely amazing! I’ve just been to see her brother Finneas and he was fabulous too! He’s such an underrated artist!
Wouaou ouou, une délicatesse au plus profond de nos sensibilités nous submerge d’une douceur de pétales de fleurs aux senteurs dune ivresse somptueuse, j’ai volé, j’ai rêvé, j’ai souri de tant de quiétude
cooolll

That transition on The greatest from 3:55😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Esto sin son tiny desk de verdad.
❤
ım better
If love isn't like this Tiny Desk I don't want it
I keep coming back to this and it is growing on me in ways I didn’t expect. Very impressed with the musical abilities of the eilish siblings…true professionals making catchy pop songs with an old school vibe that consistently reach the top of the charts!
Wowza, they are magical ❤
This one and Harry Styles my favorite
HER VOICE ANGEL 🫵🏻😍
She looks so beautiful!
So gorgeous and even more talented is a true anomaly flowers flowers flowers 🌺
Lol at her being like “I’ve wanted to do this my whole life!” girl did you forget you’ve done this already? 😭😭😭
As someone who's never really intentionally listened to Billie Eilish until now, all I can say is wow, she's good.
This is experiment
✌️😎tune❤❤❤
Now this, is oor willie😊❤❤❤
It's 😎✌️how you intergrate😊❤❤❤
pls remind me to come back to this masterpiece❤❤❤❤
Es sin duda unos de los mejores tiny desk 😢❤
Eres la mejor
Is there a maximum number of times one is allowed to play this? 😍
They're so realized, it's amazing to see them embrace that.
This must be the WORST musician I've ever heard in my life.   I have never heard such a hobble voice.......she should be backups if she's luckY
I know this will disappear into the void of the internet, but my god that voice! She's magic.
L'amour de ma vie, a gorgeous performance, incredible, amazing ❤
she is so beautiful 😊😊😊
I think UFO love Billie too
NPR is sometimes just a way for ultra commercial artists to pretend they are a legitimate act in the eyes of real music fans. Really putting the PR in NPR.
we get to see this for free??!! tiny desk i love you 😭😭
she is not a singer rather a whisperer
her and adrianne lenker should collab
Everything here is amazing,..the playing singing, harmonies, melodies.. the sound,.🫶
Your voice is so pure, I hope you stay that way forever. When I listened to your singing voice, I had an image of us working in the fields together.
it's magnificent
ahahhahaha
omg goosebumps <3
Mein diesjähriger  Sommer Hit. Wooow!   Greets from Germany :)
npr must be hurtin havin some crackhead on here XD
Some of these ad placements should be treated as a war crime
That’s sing , now all the girl singers showing their skin for selling tickets, disgusting especially Taylor she was going for football player.
Billie is something special x
By far one of the best tiny desk I’ve ever seen.
❤❤
I swear she’s an angel reincarnated to make us all happy with that voice
This version of I love you just makes me gleefully dissolved into Atoms🏆🥰
cute
She sings like a disney princess ♡
💜🩵💙💚💛❤️
You make great music so simple
Oh Billy... you're so dang dreamy 🫠. Every song is beautiful and amazing guys 💕
Oh Billy... you're so dang dreamy 🫠. Every song is beautiful and amazing guys 💕
Tiny?
Bestttttt
Billie me volaste la cabeza... Me llegaste directo al corazon❤ con tu voz me hiciste sentir enamorada.❤
That first song sounded like something the Civil Wars would have done!
Full <3
What’s the softest softness. She used to be the most famous girl. And how amazing that now it's like she's even more of a girl. How I love her simple outfit, it seems to pale against the richness of her music and singing. What a delicate tenderness
❤🤱❤
🫶🏻🙌🏻💯/💯🔥
😍😍😍
70`s radio
I want to hear finneas only, like finneas music. bros voice is insane
amazing
Billie is a gem. Please take care.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
thank you so much for this-
¡Que buen concierto!
So perfect!!! ❤
putting ads during the middle of this has got to be a crime.... got me about to cry then an ad comes up and im annoyed, out of the zone now... Billie, you're unreal. so ethereal. thank you for helping save me from the inside out.
why is Marty Friedman on drums?
Noticee meeeeee❤

bravo!
A Universal Gift. ❤
bubble gum
The new Carpenters. Already lengendary.
Wait Billie boymodes too? 🤯
Я снова в ахуе
i really loved the vibe of this Tiny Desk Concert, Billie Eilish always brings such a unique energy. but honestly, i feel like her style has shifted a bit too much lately. i kinda miss the raw, more stripped-down sound from her earlier albums. what do you all think?
Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova????
You have a beautiful voice.,. Your brother amazing as well... I have siblings we sing together and also have children and the blend of  siblings. There's nothing better than that... Amazing and beautiful. Just saying
NW
Hi from France!  A French jazz pianist, André Manoukian, said about Billie that she was the first artist of a jazz that will be that of this 21st century.   It’s sad that many still see her as just another teen pop artist. I’m 67!   I’m also one of the people who rate US artists based on the quality of their unplugged performances, my main criterion being the emotion they convey.
This album is an absolute freaking masterpiece. I still feel beyond lucky to have had the privilege to listen to it for the first time and have my jaw just on the floor.
Can you pleaaaassssse do a Finneas tiny desk  too
Reminds me of a Patty Griffin song. Also, very very relatable in my heartbroken state
🥰🥰
❤
I love you ❤️‍🔥
This two voices together are unbelivable nice
Increíble está mujer y su voz tan angelical!
por siempre billie por siempre
perfeita.
Yesss❤
enamorado
Without a doubt this is my favorite tiny desk! omg her voice, their talent is so devine
Who in 2025 😂
Uh! Gotta love Tiny Desk but these ads mid-song are killing me
Tiny desk it's a must to really see the talent of an artist. 10/10 for Billie and F. This was amazing.
18:10
I have watched this DOZENS of times. Easily my favorite Tiny Desk. Thank you for bringing Billie in!
the greatest acoustically ripped my heart out
15:27 the way finneas looked at her omg.
bit boring tbh
thats how i've re-descovered billie as a musician. such a growth in terms of vocals. just beatiful
I love her <3
na verdade, eu me esforço pra não curtir a billie. porém, confesso que esse vídeo me fez ver o quão boa ela é. vocais afinados, originais. muito talento. curti demais.
I love this like nothing else. I might be addicted to that tiny concert :)
I am dressed like a girl got me rolling 😂 but love for BILLIE❤
Omg how did I not know she did tiny desk🤦🏽‍♀️😱
15:45 the way he looks at her. that’s a proud brother
I really love their two firs singles. But then I didn’t like her new song because I love to hear the whole album, and iI was bored with When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and I didn’t connect whit happier than ever. But the last album is amazing, I really think they understood something about the world. It's like they understand why we're here and put it in their music.
No Chihiro
8:09
The Tiny Desks are becoming the new MTV Unplugged
ist sie häßlich?
♥
this whole presentation make me wanna cry, I rely love listening to you guys!
que delicia escuchar la voz de esta mujer
NPR, and The Music media is not covering the biggest story in music, fake vocals: vocals that are autotuned, pitch corrected, or vocals mimed in concert performances. Tony desk, are any vocals fixed at any stage of tiny desk concerts.  These are often applied in remixes. The technology that allows a person to auto tune and pitch correct a voice, is also the technology that proves when a singer is using it.  Here is a partial list of proven performers, caught with fake vocals:  Eagles, Bee Gees, Freddie Mercury, Simon and Garfunkel,  Taylor Swift, Lenny Kravitz, Celine, Pentatonix, Creed, Whitney Houston, Paul McCartney, Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams,  Mariah Carey,  Charli XCX, Michael Buble, Adam Levine, Ariana Grande, the Wicked film,  Sabrina Carpenter,  Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa, Chicago, Kelly Clarkson Show, The Voice,  Britain's Got Talent, The X Factor, AMA Awards Show, MTV Awards Show, BTS and most K-Pop groups, The First Take Youtube channel, etc.    This is now an industry standard  practice of all three major labels that control 70% of the music industry directly, Warners,  Universal,  and Sony.    This fakery not only cheats fans but is unfair to artists like Cher, Billie Eilish, Adele, Pink, U2, Carrie Underwood, Lainy Wilson, Pearl Jam, Simply Red, Doja Cat, or Roger Daltry, who don't use it. People need to know when there are fake vocals pretending to be real talent.
I love her music!!❤
Keeping it together 👍🎶🎶🎉❣️❣️❣️
Shame she's such a clueless leftard
Finally
❤ such an old soul beautiful
Me encanta que siempre esten juntos🥺
Heavenly song, voice & vibe. Your brother Finias sp? too!  🎉❤ You scrub up very nicely too. Of scrub means Polish in England not TLC scrub.
❤❤ wawo😊
Que maravilha de arranjo 👏👏👏   Lindo!   ❤️
Killed it
Finneas vocals added spice to I love you
🖤
Shes so pretty
Do a tiny desk with Sofia Isella!!!!
What is a song played in the reverse called- spirituality
Birds of a feather will be a song that will live forever the way we still listen to November Rain, let's Stay Together, End of the Road etc etc. Doesn't seem like it now in 2024/2025 cos how frequently music is put out but this song will stand true strong and To the test of time
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m crying 😭
🫀˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗👏👏👏
<3 always
The Tiny Desks are becoming the new MTV Unplugged
You have no idea how refreshing it is to watch someone NOT covered in tattoos.
3:58 I was wondering how they would handle the “heavy” part of the sing and I got chills..
an add in  the midle of i love you is evil
просто разъёб! Этот тандем свёл меня с ума)
L'amour de ma vie is underrated
wo
Im not trying to be "that guy", but I dont think Ferbs brother cleaned his ears that day.....Just sayuing
Awe ❤❤❤
Advert destroys the moment 😂
This is just so beautiful, she and them and all are just too much! <3
No wildflower💔💔
tiny desks are a revelation .Watching and hearing true artists perform .none moreso than [162 ] Jacob Collier x 4 ,you cannot be but overwhelmed to be part of the human race .
yessssssssssssssssssssssss  eeeeeeeeeeee   eeeeeebillieeee
wow
The way finneas looks at billie is so beautiful, truly sibling inconditional love. Their connection is surreal.
THE DETAILS..
I am not a fan of her, but I love that song at the end of her set.
5:37
Very cool music, I enjoy listening to it
Billies voice is so good it makes my ears feel guilty....
Billie just casually making my wedding playlist
8:11 BUM BUM BUM
I'm gonna fall in love with this soo smooth switch at 4:00💋
⚡
Solo is an insane name for a bassist
Ela apresentando o Finneas, como se a gente não conhecesse o querido hahahahahahaha
Putting an ad in the middle of I love you is diabolical 🥴
Prob 100k of the listens like a creep (I swear I’m just a fan obviously) never really knew about them/her like this before but NPR addict. Also solo and Abe make it worth the watch alone lol
BEAU TIFUL
My grilfriend it’s beautiful ❤
Amazing
Laufey vibes, beautiful.
21 million views, that is a statement!
TY B!
Simplemente, una obra de arte. La mejor
Mais raalala what is so flawing 😉
The way he looks at her is a little weird. Honestly.
great job on this Billie Eilish Tiny Desk Concert video! i really loved the intimate vibe and how her voice just draws you in. but honestly, while I get her unique style, sometimes I feel like her music lacks that catchy hook that makes you wanna sing along. it’s thought-provoking but maybe a bit too subdued for some listeners. just my two cents!
Birds of a feather is a masterpiece
11:55  this song always got me 💔💔💔😢
18:10
te amo, billie
So much Nina Simone in her..Thats a compliment.
I like Dead dancing Bear in the background.
The way he looks at her when she says she's nervous, all his love for her shines through
beautiful!!!
Why tiny desk why..... Might as well have Jlo on😂
how's the airport eyelash?
I would describe Billie’s voice as, “devastatingly comforting.”
Talent detected
GOD, she is so pretty ❤❤❤❤
Awsome you paralize my tinks.. so awsome its the only think that i coul say 4
Deam billie u r awsome
i love her discussion of the physical difficulty of achieving the ethereal breathy voice on Birds of a Feather
Billie is so special, and her brother is so cool, and he is a music genius, LOVE THEM!!
What a joy to hear HER sing live and the audience is silent.
I'm still incredibly amazed of how much her vocals have improved, simply amazing
Unfortunately, Billie's brother ruined much of her brilliant performance with his miserable singing.
Get Lana Del Rey! 🙏🏻
Billie is in the running for the best female voice of all time imo!!!
How am I just finding this now
I sing with you 😊😊😊😊😊❤   IN school I watch  your video ❤❤😊😊
No im not crying
Yawn...
what a voice!!!! LOVE HER!!
WOW. JUST WOW.
Proof that the Grammys are irrelevant.
Ate up BIRDS OF A FEATHER!!!!!!!!!!! I like this live version that the studio version fr!
Who i am
❤Billie ❤
Wow
Great mini concert! Sabrina has a very cute personality and is funny and it shows her music - job well done!
someone knows what happened?? :c
I did not know or have to know how good she was. I was wondering why the guy with the guitar and she harmonized so perfectly well. Ok, he's her brother. "I love you" is a perfect gem. Glad I could listen to this intimate concert!
Indah itu Pastiiiiiii❤❤❤
Brother and sister.
James Taylor cannot read sheet music.
As a 60 year old man, I want to apologise to the youth for ever doubting you could make great music. My sincere apologies 😊
ONE OF THE BEST TINY DESK I KEEP ON LISTENING ON REPEAT
🙏🙏🙏
Love it!
No sé quién es esta chica que canta, no lo hace mal... Pero al lado del timidez de bad Bunny esto no tiene color.
Poo
I havent teared up to music in a long time.. gddamn...
I have a new found respect for Billie ... very nice dynamics ... very musical ...
15:04 I love that Billie moment when a giggle escapes her.
Oh such a treat! Thanks for sharing. Can't wait to see her and her brother in Vienna June 2025
That voice....... uuuuuuuugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The sound that comes from a brother/sister combo is unmatchable - just incredible.
Beautiful beyond words.
AMO BILLIE and his music too
I have not really heard a lot of her songs, just a few. A good friend listens to her and advised me to check. They sound a fair bit like the French band "The Do", which is a good thing!
Now I discover why this artist is so very popular.
She is super beautiful and talented.
thx for sharing.
What an artist you are!
Seriously?! no party is over yet? Ohh man 🥲
Love
You cannot fake talent on Tiny Desk!
17:46 SOLOURRRRR NOURRRRR
Can we appreciate the description please, that was stunning writing
👑🫴⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡✡️✝️☯️💜🌙🌞✨
Those fake clapping & laughing sounds are horrible… Billie servers anyway
Yay!!!!! This young lady can definitely sang!!! I love to hear her sing live. This girls voice is so smooth and peaceful!!! She has such a beautiful sound and great vocal control! And she has the most beautiful smile ever!!!❤❤❤
cool
why does she sound better live than in the studio versions omg
thank you
Please I need one from Katy Perry ✨💖
I have to admit I’ve never found Billie very attractive, but she is absolutely gorgeous here. And what pure talent, my goodness.
the brother ruined the last song with his singing
No gimmicks, No BS. Just pure talent time after time. Total respect to the Tiny Desk and all who make it happen... my heart feels glad that something 'real' still exists in the World...
I'm so deeply in love with billie's voice and brain and eyes.
Gracias por el contenido, le chupaba un ojo la amo

❤I loved this
So nice to see songs I wrote performed

18:10
I'm proud to be human in this time of civilization, after enjoying this
thought I wasn’t going to cry until I love you started playing ☹️
you nailed it on the description, im brazilian and "saudade" is like missing someone that have gone, that passed away too, a moment that doesnt get back anymore...
Healing, gifted, completely complete as a duo..beautiful!
Angel's Voice❤
Pure art
Watching this after I’ve seen the concert in Copenhagen. Guess I could nor get over it.😊

Меня зацепило, хороший материал. Жаль мало народу увидело.. слышали о ютифай, пишут быстро выведет в рекомендованное видео. В общем желаю подписчиков и роста)
That was a great or amazing performance, I’m 54 and I listen to her all the time... great artists, the whole band...

7:31
Spectacular performance of "The Greatest".   Although that was a rather unfortunate cut away from Billie to the two curly Q's at 4:05.
She’s so fkin lovely u no
Snooze fest so boring
liking to get away the 666k likes
That was GOOD 🎉
She is so incredibly gorgeous and entrancing. ❤🤤
After the first chorus, a nice muted trumpet or some kind of brass would be so good during the transition to the second verse
Man, they murdered this tiny desk 🔥        Got me all in my feels & shxt 😒 👉🏾👈🏾 ...
Awesome
Q linda.. qual nome dessa canção?
Pretty opener!
The free concert every needs
Fantastic, I love you so much Billie Eilish. This melody is perfect for my head and my hurt.
No hablo ingles pero MAMII TE AMO, tu musica cura almas y repara corazones ❤
🛑Do YOU want to play a Tiny Desk Concert?🛑
TE AMOOO FKLASHFKAKSFSAFASF
She’s so shyyyy
I love how much RAW the vocals are
Someone else commented that NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts are “The new MTV Unplugged.” And whoever it was that made that comparison absolutely hit the nail right on the head.  The entire world and I have been, and will continue to, love and sing right along to these intimate, private performances! Whoever is responsible for coming up with this idea, proposing the idea to NPR, and seeing the vision through flawlessly (time and time again!) deserves all their flowers. Along with suitcases full of money from NPR! 😂😂  It’s truly such a shame that MYV sold out and sold their souls to the devil. And left us without even a shell of itself. MTV (MUSIC Television!!) hasn’t had ANYTHING to do with music in well over a decade at this point and instead turned into a 24/7 running cycle of brain rot, non-stop reality trash. They chose quick, cheap, lazy productions over quality MUSIC ORIENTED (you know…the ENTIRE PURPOSE OF THE CHANNEL!!) television. Truly sad. Thank God we at least have productions such as this that we can still count on.   And with that all said, I HAVE TO leave it at this….MTV, you fumbled hard. You allowed SOMEONE to destroy your legacy. Unfortunately, 50 years from now, no one’s going to look back on MTV with great memories, like 90’s kids will. They ruined it all and threw it away for 30 seasons of different pregnant teens, and Rob Dyrdek. (Don’t get me wrong…we all loved Rob and Big! Even some of Fantasy Factory was great! But, you turned your music based station into a Rob Dyrdek and teen pregnancy channel. So dumb.)
My daughter first played this for me when we lost my father, the most misunderstood man I grew up to love, and I still love it and switch up the lyrics from time to time to relate as therapy. 7:52am cst 4/29/25
mad talent
Who is here in Abril 2025? ❤ they are fantastic ❤
I'm waited the Tiny Desk Bruno Mars , this is my favorite singer
She's a very talented singer
thats mid
Man... what a country USA...explicit language warning. And see what's happening with deportations, with cruel wars supported...with democracy. Unbelievable.
Desde que conozco este Tiny, siempre pero siempre he he pensando lo mismo. Porque no está traducido al español automáticamente 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 al menos me quedo con la vibra y la fuerza de su voz
A favorite 🎉of mine! ❤ Thank you Billie for this ! So Great 😊
de verdad es impresionante la voz y vibra de Billie
I love you my love <3
While I studied in Dallas Texas as a Korean student, it's my only pleasure to listen to NPR Tiny Desk!! It reminds me to think about great moments in my life those time! Billy shows what young but deep, brilliant but😢 serious voice is!
tan hermosa ella.. y sus melodías también
Simplesmente fantástica 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Am❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😃
Que pena me da que en la India a mucha gente incrédula le gusta seguir a estos payasitos de circo, que de maestros y de sabios no tienen nada, esto esto es puro teatro, muy buena presentación falso baba. los maestros reales están ocultos, sin vanidades ni egolatrías  hablando sinceramente con Dios, lejos de estas hipocresías.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
홀로 숲속에서 경건히 노래 하는 사람 같음…
why is Eric Andre in the drums lol
Invite Carla Morrison
She’s so talented
TE AMO HERMOSA
¡Qué chica más maravillosa!
👏🏻🙂
So emotional <3
Does anybody know the brand name of the first black and white guitar?
Sorry, i tot Kenny G was playing drums 😂 besides, Tiny desk really change my mind about billie eilish. This is the first time i listened to her music and really blew my mind.
best production team. Great artist
Even though you didn't win a Grammy for whatever reason, we love you the world over. ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Ależ to jest piękna muzyka a przy okazji piękna dziewczyna po prostu kumulacja piękna 😊 Jerzyk
Gorgeous! ❤
b
I saw her! She’s just amazing! I saw Toro y moi, and Big Sean too! Awesome! I love “Tiny Desk”!
to be loved by billie must be something unique 🫀
The concert highlights her ability to convey complex emotions through her music, making it a captivating experience for fans
love you so much ...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Wonderful!
Definitely superior to her pop renditions.
Couldn't bee anymore Beautiful
the best tiny desk concert ever <3 <3 <3
❤
Nothing makes me respect an artist more than a tiny desk
18:10
This is the 10th time im watching and i still get goosebumps everytime i see this
Palestina livre!
❤
The percussions kicking was like a taste of heaven
Anyone here who wish for an Alicia and Billie Album❤
te amo con mi vida
Just 22 min?! I’m grateful though
Amazing!:)))))
we have a kitten named billie
You guys are awesome all that s*** in the back it's not cool something wrong with it
It's pretty incredible what Tiny Desk has become. Thanks everyone.
The only tiny desk I listened to  twice! ❤
they are absolutely amazing, so talented
❤
How is she the biggest pop star in the world and so humble and young and hasn’t ruined her life with partying and cockiness even though she lives and grew up in LA. It’s good parenting!   I’ve met Finneas. He’s super chill. Just like a normal dude.
é um crime ser tão curto!!!!!
Te descubrí y te amo ❤
Billie sei un angelo, grazie per la tua devozione.
Ads are starting to interrupt songs
Teknik berbisiknya terbaik di dunia. Masih.
I love you
Lets take a moment from this beautiful sound that is Billie's voice and think about  this, can you imagine the pressure under the bass player (Solo was his name?) while playing I Love You? Im not saying is easy, i myself could never play like that, but imagine him distracted or something and missing a note, on that song, the pressure broooo
Lovely for ever and always❤❤💔💔🫦
this is the best thing ever. helped me fall asleep also.  extremely calming
💖🌠
Man I love this. Lets go for more acoustics :) Billie <3
her voice makes me tear up, every time.
she's perfect.........
Thank You NPR. I have been under a rock with much modern music. This was refreshing and impressive. Billie and all her band here painted such lovely pictures.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this is SO RAW, and I absolutely ADORE How Raw billie was with her emotions while singing her songs ( as always) but this was soo perfectly imperfect and thats what made this sooooo BEAUTIFUL, It's like we get to see more of the artists personality a lot more clear
She is (and especially she with him) absolutely legendary. Goodness just pure talent.
Dios mío me muero como Phinneas mira a su hermosa hermana  mientras canta, ambos son increíblemente maravillosos, tienen muchísimo talentoooo 💗
May someone know the first small guitar Finneas hold? Brand and model?
she has no voice
She's definitely one of a kind!
I love it. Love Billie. Glad she did Tiny Desk
Yo no puedo escucharla sin que me genere un sentimiento de llanto instantáneo.. pero de felicidad.. gracias por tu gran talento billie ❤
A bicha canta muito
Ella y su voz es tan hermosa😔♥️
Why are you singing my thoughts to my son？
Finneas them back up vocals be hitying brother😂❤❤❤❤❤
sobbing because she's coming to my city in two weeks, and I don't got them money.
Babyy 😙💖
Her music is soul felt
Your voice is heavenly. Love you Billie
You can see how much she means that lyrics and the vocals.
An angels voice ❤
SHE SO GORGEOUS
She is such a talented singer!
❤‍🩹
sometimes I forget how good she is. god, I love her
Eres maravillosa
If u r reading this. I miss u more than anything, you are the love of my live. I’m trying my best…. Hope to see you again.
Wonderful
Wow.  That was a treat & a half!
Why does she have a tiny desk, I thought this was supose to promote SMALL and NEW upcoming artists???
Billie rocks!
Beautiful voice 🤩🙌
Sound technician/mixer whatever the terminology is, this person needs a raise. Everything sounds so good and warm even in my Airpods.
19mill views here on April 16, 2025!!! Crazy!
❤❤❤
She is so beautiful
Top 5 performance for me
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Su cara en el min 09:59 😍💕
❤ Minuto 4:01 Es dopaminaaaaa! 🤯
🇨🇱😉
I really like her like this....simple, true, talented!
the genuine love between two siblings is hardly more visible than between Billie and Finneas, she takes most of the spot light but he's always there in the background backing his baby sister up
15:00 ❤
So refreshing to hear ,every now and then an artist to redefine music comes along
STAR
Amo con todo mi ser a esta mujer, no puede ser mas increible lo que genera cada ves que la escucho ♥️
Chappell is such a talented singer and performer. It's amazing. I love her so much!!❤❤
Super cute reminds me of my high-school uniform
This is something else. Portishead vibes
My brother was my best friend also. He died and I can't cope, we grew up with music and both loved it.... it's hard to explain but it's not the same way anymore
I always saw Billie as a huge talent but in the hands of super producers in the business that created a couple of numer ones, and than disappereard . I´m glad I was wrong. So much talent here and rooting at the same time
Marhaba marhaba ❤❤all my loves ❤❤all for you ❤❤
what is billie drinking?
I love this! But I thought that the desk were tiny, but not the concert it self!
Caralho ein. Ela é perfeita. Os dois são
best ive heard :)
17:06 cute 🥰
The first song gave The Civil Wars vibes 😍😍🙌🙌
A came cross this by accident I've never really heard of her songs she's a better singer than I thought she was Not really enjoying it much though but much respect 19 million views that's crazy and I don't even really know who she is Her singing is somewhat talented
She is so talented,she sounds even better live .... u can tell how she is feeling everything that she is singing ... amazing.
Cómo es que de esto pasamos a Bad Bunny?  Merecemos mejores artistas  Lastima @nprmusic 😢
🌍🌎🌏🗝️♥️
Ela sabe quem é ❤
Jonathan  ❤❤❤   Storm  B💫❤️

Just think if you meet someone. And they ask you what you do... And you are able to tell them you play the keyboard for Billie Ellish.. or bass ..  or drums. 😮 Amazing..!
Trump is killing possibly tens of thousands of people (or more. Estimates show much worse numbers) by destroying USAID.  We must protest against this genocide immediately, because people are being killed at this moment, as well as demonstrating against war in Ukraine and Gaza.
💘
This has to be one of the most boring tiny desks
Who's listening in 2035?
Gosh, she's beautiful...
You can tell there siblings with those huge foreheads
She so stunningg I love her so much❤️‍🩹❤️
I got an ad immediately before one of the songs resolved. smh
Just beautiful❤
😍😍😍😍
wonderful and perfect...!!!
Escuchar esto me deprimio
I get goosebumps
Wow
Wow The Greatest like this sounds amazing, so does the original of course :D
An Angel
This is the greatest tiny Desk ever. I wanted more please bring Billie for a part 2
WOW 😱
Really that’s Vinneas disguised as Finneas.
Billie just knows how to touch hearts!
So every person in this tiny desk performance got a zoom in except for the black guy on the bass? 🤔 Nice TD… Turned the camera exactly at the point where we could’ve seen him up close & appreciated what he brought to her performance…
Buena acusticas y voces magicas😘
The female Justin Bieber
🎵 Birds of a feather, you're, a fkn N-word and I... 🎶
Flawless.
I've never actually listened to any of her songs but obviously I have heard of her. I certainly can see why she is so well loved. Exceptional talent the both of them.
i really don't normally like this kinda of stuff, im more into jeff Rosenstock but i feel billy and her brother have a connection that reminds me of my and and sister just pure comfort like a blanket that you can just be anything with so i love the music because i think its so connected between a brother and sister  my sister a singer as well shes doing good for herself so i hope we can make something amazing like this together as well.
Masterpiece🥹🥹🥹🥹✨
eres la mejor, Billie, la verdad, temo que cumplas 27 años
The bassist is what I’m always looking for. Simple running bass lines. The groove.  Yeah!
too many ads. can't enjoy.
I can't believe how their songs are already amazing but they get to make'em event better on live.
She is looking kinda Emilia Clarke lateley 😊
Wow - amazing voices. Only "Birds of a Feather" is better on spotify :D
that "pam pam pam" on l'amour was ABCAGDHSHXHSH i wanna bite it
❤❤❤
te amo con mi vida
Que voz tan hermosa, es la primera vez que la escucho y es increíble
THIS IS ARTTT
still can't believe she decided to sing i love you instead of any of the oldies. i love it.
Why is the curt cobain singing like its his song
Phenomenal
I love this!
Pure work of art.❤
THE GREATEST  0:05 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE  6:25 i love you  11:36 BIRDS OF A FEATHER  18:10
Ridiculous. So much talent…
hasnt hit like this since mac
Por qué no se calla finneas? Neta nada más jode las buenas partes, que se resigne a ser el hermano de la estrella, NO LA ESTRELLA.
amazing😍
I guess that almost 10% of I don't like it is because they put their musical preferences before musicality... It's not my favorite genre but this girl sings beautifully...
Beautiful...
Encendió el pupitre Benito!!🇵🇷 Saludos a tu Papi de parte de Ernie de Bajuras!
TRACKLIST:  0:06 - The Greatest 6:27 - L’amour de ma vie  11:36 - I love you  18:11 - Birds of a feather
❤❤❤
I don't care who gets the grammys, if your here you know she's the greatest.
The way he looks at his little sister adoringly after every song has GOT to be the cutest thing I have seen in awhile🥰 I have the same age gap with my big brother  but he is so annoying and not really supportive lol. I love that Finneas has been with his little sis and supported her every step of the way.
I would sit here and listen to her sing acoustic versions of her songs w Finneas for HOURS.
Billie if you are reading this one day and you are reflecting on your amazing work, know that you have saved me from a lot, just as much as Bangtan Sonyeondan has saved me. I'm forever in debt to you and the 7 amazing kings of South Korea BTS
I love how much happier/brighter this version of Birds of a Feather sounds. Like the album version is very sweet but in a soft, almost sad/wistful way. This one sounds like the way the first clear sunbeam in Spring feels
BILLIEEEEEE
A freaking master piece!!!! Are you kidding me!?
Great show 👏👏👏
Gracias Benito❤
La muchacha de rojo con su sonrisa le una luz y una vibra muy bonita al set!🙌🏼🫶🏽 me encanto! 🎉 next stop, P.R!!
wau
El final me dio un sentimiento tan cabron mientras estaba en el trabajo.
Зря встала на последней песне
I am a 70-yr-old retired teacher. I love Billie and Finneas beyond measure and I need you to brighten my every day. Peace, Love, Light and Shadow, too
La cabra !! Viva Puerto Rico ! 🇵🇷
BENITO HIJO DE BENITO LE DECIAN TITO OOOO🥲
LOOOVVVEEEEDDDD!!!
How her brother looks at her... like "I'm so proud and I support you girlll!" Billie, you are amaaaazing!
Who’s listening April 2025v
GOOSEBUMPS.... ❤❤❤
Eddie Vedder please go up and show some deep songs! Bring it back Pearl Jam!
When it's just true talent. Jeebus.
I'm so obsess with billie. >.<
This is call talent.. talent a lot.. talent talent... Gorgeous
The best voice in this world at this moment... Beautiful define... Period
You have the most sweetest voice ever, can listen to for hours.
will be listening to this to sleep.
"I love you " is one of my favorites ❤️
❤❤💕💕
Robbed at the Grammys. She is incredible ❤
Billie you sounds perfect acoustic, that's real talent
Travis Hunter on base? Is there anything he can’t do?
Best I've seen so far!
In the mind of the Divine Feminine. Couldn't be chiller.  Billie is the female Mac Miller.
I haven’t even watched this yet and I’m liking liking it.
Completely random thought, but I'm about 9 minutes in, and I would love to hear you do Pearls songs from Steven universe
I love Billy Ilish 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:17 the greatest  6:30 L’AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:40 i love you  18:14 birds of a feather
Best version of greatest, wish they Had just the cut video of greatest
22 minutes 18 of Billie Eilish, what a dream ❤😍😍
Eu não consigo parar de ver, meu deus
단 10초를 들었는데 이미 전율했습니다
the subtle intricacies of her voice have developed so much in the last couple of years. been here since the soundcloud days. love to see you grow B <3.
oh my goodness this is crazy
I had no idea, because I never gave Her a listen, today Billie Has become My  new Deep dive of Musical Adventure, and has become such lately, leading up to this Video !
What a biiiiiig sin is to place an ad in such beautiful moments when Billie is letting herself gooooo with the song. 😭😭😭 I loove this tiny desk concert so much. ❤❤
wish I was there
remind me every time u see this so I can rewatch it
billie eilish te amo
This is exactly what perfection is.
15:50 HOLY CHILLS
6:48
I love the calm delivery of vocals 👌🏾
She's so amazing 👏 🥲
NPR and this one are perfect for each other.  Defund NPR they are Anti-American and Anti-Freedom
el cielo
Just give us a jazz album Like Ella or Billie; Billie! Its the new 20's! We need it! Get some brass in there!! You got the chops gurl.
True artist... cool, venerable, but effortless!
This is raw talent
Es una caricia al sentido auditivo!
Stunning
Petition to get Lana on here 😭
Crying...
interromper um hino desses com anúncios é quase um crime
Encoure encoure!!! Bravo bravo!!!
SHUT UP BILLIE
Well this was just exquisite
Billie Eilish is amazing good    ❤❤❤    Discover also the music of     Emmy d'Arc    and enjoy listening to her as well .     💙💙🎶💙💙
que lipstick usara Billie?
Andrew drums is so handsome sorry cant stop looking at him lol 😍
te amo billie eilish
great Billie, i love it this song "BIRDS OF A FEATHER"
Esa bandera mexicana me llama aa conocerrte: Jaggy+Kal+Billie= Mystic Mix to-go
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the greatest acoustic at the beginning needs to be a movie end credit holy
Mi sembra di guardare una band sottovalutata 😭💓
Really Really good
Billie is a Breath of Fresh Era
Am i the only one wondering why her and her brother keep looking at each other like that while she sings a song about falling in love for the first time?
6:27 супер
pom pom pom
Great voices with no computerized tweaking, impressive.
Would i be crazy, asking a Lady Sovereign NRP?
Had not been appreciative of her music catalog so far. Actually described it as depro-pop to some friends. Until i heard Birds of a Feather. Beautiful song.
I demand a Grammy for her!
As everyone knows, Billie and Finneas are incredibly talented, and we’re truly lucky to be able to listen to their music.
I justtt loveee tiny desk so much !!! And the soundd sooo crisp.. Never been better ❤❤
Lovely.
la cabrita
Soo good the raw and the real awesome nothing to hide behind thank you
she was honestly robbed at the grammys, its such a scam. also i can’t believe she saying i love you… that song is everything to me.
I love you is by far my favourite song ever sung by a female lead . It was a song that got me through some tuff nights
6:27
Bro this is better than the studio album
She deserves that Grammy man
I'm 59 and never got the attraction for her or the music. But this is nice; I guess such presentation wouldn't register with the demographic.
8:13 ahhhh… 🫨🫨😌😌😌🤍🤍🤍🤍
Wow! Such talent ❤️
shes so great1 omg perfect
whats the catch everyone has tall hair
pewdiepie playing guitar for npr music now huh..
No you're crying.
im obsessed with this tiny desk, I love uuuu billieeeeeeeeeeeee
It is infinitely more accurate
que obra de arte
Che talento!! Bravissimi tutti
¡Mágico! ¡Grande Billie!
i need an acoustic album like i need my lungs to breathe tbh
6:26
Ich glaube, es ist ein minimal talentierter Mann...💋💋💋
So touching
I WANT YOU TO STAY
Who can also listen to birds of a feather an hundred times without getting tored of it
Who feels like everytime you listen to her music its like you connect to her
That key change or whatever you want to call it in the greatest, at the tail end is incredible! from 4 minutes to the drums at 430 and it all wrapped up like that is so good. The count in Billie does from 2:10 to 2:12 for the pianist is super dope too! Such a great offering!
Who thought it would be when the party's over
Her modest dressing is top notch honestly
i luv u billie <3
SHE SANG I LOVE YOU IN THIS AND I DID NOT HEAR ANYBODY SAYING ANYTHING???
The harmonies…
I truly believe we're all witnessing greatness here. True generational talents. One day we'll look back on this and cannot believe we were there to accompany them and their art.
Wow. They are incredible. Even compared to the other great artists that have been on the show. Their style is so unique! 😮
I love what they did with Saria's song <3 11:40
do nada os cara meteu Saudade e o significado na descriçãoslk
🥹 my heart
kann ihren ruhm null verstehen ist kein hate und english ist auch nicht meine muttersprache aber für mich ist da einfach kein klang in der stimme...
Oh mon Dieu, tu ne cesses de t'améliorer, c'est fou, incroyable ! tout mon amour pour vous deux wow !
i love it billie
Billie & Finneas 4vr 🐺🌊❤️‍🔥🫠
arrrf. 🏴‍☠
Bandera de Colombia a la vista 🇨🇴❤
Most applause I've heard from the staff on a Tiny Desk before
ive been listening to billie since I love you, when that song came on i was transported to being 12 listening to the lyric videos on youtube music
Singing without the auditory feedback is more authentic.
No canta bien
Speachless. # Too sensitive and beautiful.
this soothes my period cramps
She has such beautiful eyes
You deserved all the awards of the world with this album girl come back now.
SHES SOOO PRETTY 😊😍
PRINCESS OF SONG
I didn’t know she was beautiful and could sing until I saw it.
admit or not, tiny desk moves the world.
Brilliant
tell angie hey
pam pam pam 😍
Reminds me of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova
🥰
i love you: 11:36
Amazing voice
saya terharu, billie mengharumkan nama NGANJUK di kancah internasional
It's crazy how well a voice and song writing can resonate.  I also admire how close she and her bro are.
Good to see Kevin Kaarl's boot still there
The Grammies are a joke, how can an album like that get 0 wins?💀
8:13 BUM BUM BUM
Love her.
I am boycotting any company that interrupts my billie experience mid song with an ad 😅😂
Genius
fineas cierra el an0
Billie 😍❤️
Dang, was I wrong...
Lord have mercy
The Weeknd on tiny desk concert next ? 🥹 for the one and last time
Very nice 👏👏👏
Look at you just look wow🎉. I am humbled and inspired by your strength your humor your authentic life and the storm is the best advice I can do a giveaway for you today 🌷🩷🧩🩵🎴
I love billie eilish chikos💗😭💗😭
the Richard and Karen Carpenter of our modern day
the mix is a little bit right-biased, is it supposed to be like that?
words cant describe
Неожиданно я в ахе Билли Айлиш и акустика
Hearing grown up Billie sing "i love you" just healed something in me ❤❤
👌🏻
Wow! ❤
Can you please invite The White Buffalo some time? Would be a great Tiny Desk Concert..
you won't see those Korean singers here .....cuz we talking about real talents here.
Angle of voice
Billie I love you so much
She looks extra pretty here
great
"I was the love of your life, but you are not mine." is the most narcissistic statement.
an ad 1:21 seconds into the video is absurd
❤️‍🩹
Oh my God, you just keep getting better it's crazy, amazing! all my love to both of you wow!
Até chorei 🥰
18:05
IM A KENDRICK GUY BUT BIRDS OF A FEATHER WAS A CLOSE SECOND FOR SONG OF.THE YEAR I LOVE THIS SONG. GETS ME IN MY BAG BUT ALSO STILL HAPPY
this solidifies being a fan of billie eilish for me
That version of I Love You hits different. 😢❤
Rip to the last “Ooh” from “i love you” that wasn’t in this performance.
This is way better than i expected
You know , I’ve heard Billie’s music on the radio but never really listened to her until just this video . Beautiful
0:33 - the greatest 6:44 - l'amour de ma vie 11:53 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
everything about Billie and Finneas' talent is absolute outstanding... but can we talk about how literally mesmerizing her eyes are?
If only she was old enough when the twilight series was being filmed. Any song in this would’ve made the soundtrack legendarily
This song just made me cry
8:10 Bom bom bom
I haven't stopped crying
These lyrics are so heartfelt sung so beautiful anyone with experience most likely can relate
BILLIE IS LOWKEY HOT. WONDER WHATS UNDER THOSE BAGGY CLOTHES
¡Ay, qué bonico! ❤
The way this woman gives me full on goosebumps and tears in my eyes when she sings.
11:37
-wut-
soooooo cute
god i love billie eilish
"We'll be okay one day, just maybe not right now."   - Billie Eilish, Tiny Desk (home) Concert, 2020
Bravo!! Que linda tu energía Billie
It sounds incredible, it transfers tranquility. I love Billie's music.
I’m sorry but Billie should have been the Grammy winner instead of Beyoncé and that POS country album!
Can anyone share the model of that microphone?
Repeat, repeat, repeat
it's crazy how in "i love you" it sounds like they could shift into the changes in "the greatest" pretty easily if they wanted to. a couple parts in there where she starts going up the notes and in my head it would roll over into that song in a pretty smooth melody fashion.
ламповый концерт что такое ламповый я не знаю, но другого слова не подобрать
15:07 Has anyone noticed her laughing here? haha I'd like to know
1:06 ohh how I love their harmonies 🥹🎶
<3
faltou minha fav: wildflower
maravilhosos
happy their parents did it raw bc if they hadn't we wouldn't have these absolute bangers
bb was robbed by the grammys. so incredible
Just listen to billie sing when you are drained by the world, it just melt away your stressless from her voice 🫗 this woman is definitely the best musical therapist ever
Voice of an angel. I remember hearing her for the first time and was blown away.
beautiful voice
why Eilish? Doe she really need even more exposure than she has?  Without her producer, musician, family with money... she is just a lucky teenager.
Where is the linggang guli guli!?
Shes absolutely stunning. Her voice is beyond amazing too.
This is another level unlocked 😊😊😊
I miss my big brother. This is a treat that will be replayed from today on.
16:48 so good
I can never listen to “I love you”without crying. Such an amazing song.
🫂❤️
Big mood don't wanna be acting up too fast yeah putting all my eggs into the basket I can't help but it's a habit have it but believe me you persevere me and it ain't easy to be pleasing me so give me a minute to work out how I've been feeling I said I did but I didn't this story's still being written you got no clue this is getting me this is how it's supposed to be confusing don't wanna do me so endlessiv it don't seem so logical to decide that vou're evervthing I need I'm tryna keep my groove but don't you see I got a big mood for you for you for you I don't know what to do about vou about you about you I got a big mood for you for you for you I know what to do about vou about you about you I wonder if you got that big move for me too is it true or am I just acting like a fool cause I do that quite often I'm always falling this heart's been harden but you make me soften but I've got the realization that I'm chasing someone who ain't really Viking  so that's why I'm tryna face it real slow let me take my time on you while I figure out what to do don't seem so logical too decide that you're everything I need I tryna keep my cool but don't you see I got a big mood for you for you for you I don't know what to do about you about you about you 1 got a big mood for you for you for you what to do bout you bout you bout you I know you got a big mood for me too and you got a big mood for me too I got a big mood for you for you..
BillieGoat❤️‍🔥
the last time I listened to I love you was years ago:(
❤
linkin park Tiney desk pls
She looks so grown
Jeez the lyrics be hitting me.
One of the worst tiny desks so far
weasome
That’s weird, the intro where it promotes the company “Better Help” got removed.
i’ve just been staring at my screen for the past 22 minutes with pure admiration and fascination…these are artists.
How many people are in that office? The applause (while appropriate) is thunderous.
😍😍
very cool definitely going to have to take this into consideration
the guy of the guitar what a bad voice. out of tone 100%
<3
I have been a Billie fan...but after I seen this I'm whole air conditioner 😂😂😂 hooked isn't even the word!!! Made me so mad how they did my homegirl at the grammys
The way they touch people souls are undeniable
The piano :O
Güzelim 😙💖
voce tem chance com meu primo leo
portugal mentioned at the description <3 <3 <3
Omg it’s so beautiful!
you have some of the best lyrics i have ever seen and i have seen lyrics thank you for inspiring even your generation @billie
awesome
❤❤❤
Great for get sleep, boring to death.
Me encanta ella canta con el alma se nota 💕 ♥️ 💖
She's amazing
20:50 ya pongan a dormir a ese perro que se escucha que está sufriendo😂
the book in the background brings it to the point: play billie! i am 50. this is my new nirvana unplugged. thx billie for joining earth!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
15:35  the way Funnies is looking at Billie :)
I'm actually moved by this concert. Years after her first Tiny Desk Concert she's back, still with her brother, after all this life experience. What an achievement!  To answer the question Billy asks in the first song: Yes
This is BY FAR my favorite tiny desk. No matter how many times i listen to it i always get goosebumps like the first time i watch it. It makes me feel safe, at home, calm 🦋
Stunning vocals. 🎶
She kind of sounds like Amy Winehouse  ♥♥♥
Watching this after she was ROBBED at the grammys😔😪
Reminds me of Zelda 64 with this instrumentation.
I hope you’ll have Melanie Martinez on Tiny Desk someday 💕
You need Trumpet/Flugel solo
good god. i hope she comes out with acoustic music
i hope one  day she becomes a bigger pop star than taylor swift because she deserves it so much. taylor is amazing but she can’t sing like billie and her music isn’t as good as billies, no one relates to billie more than me and all her fans
i wanna be able to sing like this
the fact she sang i love you and finneas was there and just made she sure she was okay just makes me so happy
If these two hadn’t become artists, it would have been a great loss for the music industry. This is what pure talent looks like! Bravo!!!
WOW Fantastic ❤
i loveeeeeeeeeeeeee
dale billie te pusiste pilla 73 anuncios en un tema banca loca
still my favorite Billie’ performing “best of” so good ‘unplugged’
wow
TE AMO BILLIEEEE
0:48 bro the greatest was got me in tears
this girl is ace
For me Billie and Adele are the best in the work of making background music for working. I'm really in love for how she make me feel singing even in the middle of a library. One day I will be in a Tiny Desk Concert and why not in a Billie Eilish's acoustic concert.
Cannot compare to Amy Lee.
wow
Honestly, I thought that a lot of these would be better. I’m sorry but Chappell Roan blows all these guys away. I went from not knowing who she was to being obsessed with her in literally 2 minutes. She was so good live that I was speechless. So with this one Billie E , it is sooo boring that I can’t force myself to watch anymore then a minute. And Taylor Swift spent half the show blabbing about stuff no one cares about. The hole point of these is to showcase their music how ever they want , not to talk and talk.  I’ve only watched about 5 so fare and I’m big time disappointed except for Chappell , what a talent, but unfortunately she’s not a very nice person in reality but based on talent she’s got bucket loads! 🤷‍♀️💜
Dang
Comes back here every now and then cause npr waited 2025 to invite them 🎉
She sings so beautifully.
I hate saying this. But I hope she takes a small break to live and not get burned out.
For me she is the sweet and feminine version of Jeff Buckley... Wonderful.🥰
Thinking that you're better that someone, hating that you do. Being an empathetic person, it's certainly so conflicting.
Baby Tron next
She has the voice of this century. No one can compare.
This is very very valuable art. Very high quality what comes from them.
Let's all just pay a little more attention to Finneas switching instruments between every single song
One of the best
i  lo ve  you  billy  eillsh
😯🤩😍
I listen this everyday while going to work. Best 22 mins indeed ❤
vcs vao trazer a sza quandooo????
Bro she’s the greatest female artist I’ve ever seen in my life 🐐
De lo poco bueno que hay en esta industria en la actualidad. Te amo Billie y espero hagas música para nosotros hasta que tengas 100 años😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Awesome 🙌
What was the name of that first song
like
its a shame you dont have wizkid here
Billie, darling, please do an acoustic album. This video is my favorite way to listen to these songs because the mix and vocals hit different.. I guess you could say they hit me hard AND soft ;)
17 YEARS...I was only 18. The church told me I was the one to save him,myself and my whole family. SEVENTEEN YEARS-I've only been healing for 10... 1st song hit me hard in the feels. Such talent to be able to stir 17 yrs of heartache when they're barely even 17 years OLD...🥹
Love this! Also 👀 can we get an Ari tiny desk…
Todos os dias por aqui❤
i cried to the song i love you so many times
Finneas shoukd do this for his music ! A mix of both would have been amazing
the way the complement each other is MAGIC!
18:07
So beautiful ❤😮 makes my heart felt heard
is robert pattinson playing the guitar?
Literal chills😍
I use these to tell if the musician is actually talented. You can really tell when you stipe out all the production and effects.
Okay, I'm wrong, shes not fd up
Pretty sure she's fd up lol
Music is Life 🎶
wow
I felt like Billie sang her freaking heart out on this.  I really appreciate it, it was amazing!
Her brother is so talented as well!!! Omg the chills during I love you
11:37 why does it sound a lot like saria’s song from ocarina of time.
Lei oggi 2025...rimane l'unica , la piu' grande ,vice stupenda e musica ❤
18:10
acoustic and simple version are better always
a PRESENT .... THANK YOU
Beautiful singing, beautiful music, beautiful playing
와 !!! 너무 감미롭다.
Y pensar que toco con Ca7riel y Paco amoroso...
Finneas is the best songwriter of our generation
Such an angelic voice ❤
They need better mics!!! It was definitely giving off static/clipping when she wanted to use the more louder octaves.
Los amo
Te amo Finneas.
Gotdayum her voice melts my insides 🥹😭🥰
Iconic wow ❤🎉
Literally in tears. We love yu sm billie ❤❤❤
Love Phineas and Billie ❤
the winner takes it all, and the others??? no thing.
Pretty and the prettiest sings the song of the feather
the pretty band
Gangs back chat 🙏💕
Very classy to introduce the band each 'by name'.  Really love their music.
La Nicki Nicole anglo😁🎵🎶🎼
Hopefully her fans learn from this Tiny Concert, the art of remain silent when this human sings...
Imagine this featuring for a sec… Billy & Damien rice 😮
Billies brother looks at her with such love, the connection they have is absolutely beautiful, these two together are beyond talented, what an amazing concert. I love them so much. Her voice is so easy to fall in love with.
We Need a second Part,and a third,fourth,hundreth. I love this
18:08 Easy replay of Birds of a Feather
I didn't listen to the album because i listened to her the whole time my heart was getting destroyed.. but this is different. It doesn't hurt anymore. So glad to hear these songs for the first time now. Thanks tiny desk
Amazing!
a mina eh braba!
t amo billie
thats why you donate Bitcoin to me bc1qx898lal9hlanhm6pxhn6wv40ww2j3tgpmzhsxm
7:30
She’s so expressive when she sings I love it! Not alot artists do that
No autotune needed or requested. Thank god.
4:44 :((((
Wow....they all sound incredible live!!  This is as good, but really better, than the recording!!
Great job, Ms. Eilash.
Her voice gives me goosebumps it is so beautiful and the sister brother duo is amazing!
Grammy, just ignore this album. They also did the same thing with Kary Perry and Lana Del Rey. R.I.P Grammy, just like clown show now.
Tiny desk concert is growing bigger and bigger keep on going team keep on uploading don’t stop 🫡 🙌🏻
The way I can picture this performance in a sexy, smoky jazz club late at night with a cocktail in hand. The jazz/soul influence is REAL. We would all be so lucky to catch a brilliant live performance like this one in such an intimate setting as Tiny Desk!
4th time watching this this morning
Llegué tarde al tren de Billie ellish pero de aquí ya no me bajo
Incredible.  I love the harmonizing especially and how tenderly the instruments are played on The Greatest.

1시간해줘요
❤❤❤
20:57 😍
I need to work for NPR so I can see these shows in person
Untalented
Its not a tiny desk, its average!
no one's pointing out that she's singing this SITTING DOWN. like Billie I have so much admiration for you.
Blessings From Penzance , Cornwall ❤
Grande Luisito comunica en el piano y el la batería :3
Alguem vendo em Março...? 🥹
AMAZING
EAAAAAATTTTTT
This made me tear up. It was so beautiful.  ❤. They’re such a magical pair
Why no Wildflower? No Chihiro? ;(
That is the most loud ovation I ever heard in the tiny
melhor versão de the greatest, juro, que lindo isso ficou ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
ela é tão preciosa, amo muito 💛
still crying
I'm from Azerbaijan and if I had a voice like yours, the only thing that makes me happy these days is if we could recognize it (my name is
That duet with her brother blew my mind. I love them!
This Tiny Desk Concert is AGAIN the best I've ever heard.................never let it stop!
You're voice is so angelic which is a Stark contrast to ya lyrics LOL love it ❤
You're voice is so angelic which is a Stark contrast to ya lyrics LOL love it ❤
My long time wished is  to play at : The Royal Albert Hall
so soothing
Saudade ❤
Mmmm I'm not really feeling her voice.
18:10 birds of a feather
1 MINUTE IN AND IM HEALED THIS IS THERAPEUTIC
3:59 is heaven
Do you wanna be my girlfriend, Billie?. Mamasita mía!
Can NOT watch this woman without becoming teary eyed
If that's not a vampire couple I don't know what is. Beautiful still.
🤍
You'd think sure... anyone can do this, but these two are so far ahead of their peers and contemporaries. Most musicians try twice as hard and never reach half what they achieved. Amazing. Sophisticated. Already icons in my book. I am looking forward to their future and the legacy they leave.
Amo de mais ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She is a Mermaid Muse incarnated!! With Mermaid voice and piercing eyes! With the name of a pirate! XD
I really loved this session😍😍🥰🤩
I cannot even find the right words for you both! Amazing from aus!!!
u have to feel that, amazing
이것도 좋네
Ggs
I gave it a thumbs down because I think you can do better. The song and music was trendy, already done, gimmicky and repetitive.
crying
Her little giggle, I can'tttt! We're hearing the voice of an angel rn and I can't deal
Absolute tragedy that she won nothing, because she didn't wear black finger nail polish and worship some goat headed god. She poured every last bit of herself into that album and it is truly her best work ever. We see you Billie well done, well done indeed.
Wow..I'm speechless
I come back here frequently
6:27 L'amour
Heaven. Golden droplets of sound trickling over my ear drums.  Beautiful art from the heart xx I'm soothed xx
This beautiful.. wauw. Just wauw.
she makes me wanna cry. <3
It's so amazing how tiny desk can really bring out the true potential of these artists. Brava, tiny desk!! ALSO I LOVE U BILLIE
Amazing artist and band!
Amazing! The vocalist of Gen Z!!!!!!
ES TAN DULCEEEEEEE 😍😍😍
They are so reminiscent of Glen and Marketa in Once.
don't make me SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK her live videos take me the f out for a week
she's like a flute
🙄
i enjoyed that a lot...
She’s greatest ❤
Un concierto más que quedará para la historia :)
Excellent. I’m with Squidders (not literately)…. ❤️
I remember when NPR actually supported art.
“ I Love You “ has to be one of my favourites of the 2010’s. Or at least the late 2010’s. Gorgeous track.
This is the sort of Billie concert I want to pay to go to <3 Or just in their house, where it all started. Sitting along side their mom realizing what she heard from the other side of those walls. Realizing the talent that was just waiting to be discovered. Man, that would be SO FRIKKEN COOL. Love you Billie & Finneas <3
i love this, billie puts so much emotion into her performances
I'm so in love with her is not even funny.
the whole performance is great but I lost my mind at 'L'amour de ma vie' 🤯
18:00
Her voice is so beautiful and unique. I'm so glad I discovered her music 💖💖💖
excellent music Billie
WOW!!!!!!!!!
I feel this with you billie
johnny cash?
já perceberam que a Billie parece estar namorando  o tecladista?
It's so beautiful ,It's godlike.
When is Passenger coming through, I can't wait..
💙✨
i'm happy she chose i love you because it is my favorite too!
Best voice i've ever heard my entire life. That raw voice. Even the little cracks sounds pleasing ❤ i knew it the moment i heard her for the first time, that was the "bad guy" playing as an ad. I loved her since then and thought, this voice is going to be so powerful and im not wrong. Look at her now. Her and finneas' pure talent brought her to the top. No other extras, just pure talent. All my applauses and admiration for this siblings ❤
fix your ad placements please😭🙏🏼
I can't believe this is a child's voice! Absolutely amazing! 👏🎶
The restraint and effortless precision in every performer on display here is mind blowing.
finneas ruined omgg
What is the electric guitarist name
00:00 "THE GREATEST"    6:24 "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE"  11:20 "I love U"   18:09 "BIRDS OF A FEATHER"
ya no quiero a manito-sopresa very scarry I love you syster I love you brother lets says hello thi ♥
papas poligámicos permutan libro sagrado por generación paso generación
How do find your lyrics
oh this gal's glowin
Billie is a national treasure. I came to her music via my daughters, and thank god for that. So genuine, so expressive and vulnerable and tasteful. Finneas also deserves heaps of credit as a songwriter and producer. SO many songs I wish I could see performed in this format. But the biggest heartbreaker is Chihiro. From a musician’s perspective, it makes no sense at all that HIT ME HARD AND SOFT didn’t win album of the year. Not only a supreme achievement in musical craftsmanship, but ALSO managing to be incredibly accessible, relatable, and popular. Very rare indeed.
sooo profoundly melancholic, this music   ...only want to drown myself after listening to it
best voice in show business
18:12
Are NPR Tiny Desks available via streaming services like Amazon Music? I cannot find.
Billie Eilish and PewdiePie. The collab we never expected to happen in Tiny Desk. This is a dream!!!!
This is my first time listening to Billie Eilish, I don't know what I was expecting but this was not it. Her music, lyricism and voice makes me feel like writing poetry
Beautiful. A stunning concert❤ her vocal control..off of the chain, the band is on…her brother…perfect!  love  the  whole  thing
The set sequence, for me, is so perfectly put together. First starting with these heartbroken, sad and depressive songs only to end in birds of a feather. The harmful cycle of a toxic relationship and being unable to leave it due to the sheer amount of emotions that are being triggered. Bravo
I adore Tiny Desk , Billie and Band are absolutely perfect for this setting . I would love to be in that room ! Her voice ! They harmonize so beautifully !
she's so preeeetttyyyy
All you had to do was dim the lights set a mood it’s just to bright for the songs
I think it is time to invite Einar Selvik in for a song or two.
I'm s😢try but what's the name of song?
Maybe I haven't watched very many concerts but i dont think there are that many singers who sound that great singing live, but  She....SHE is ... MEZMORIZING & ENCHANTING. Last time I felt anywhere near this was when I heard Lana Del Ray for the 1st time❤
Que linda voz que linda persona que linda música todo hermoso gracias🎉
I was the love of your life but you were not mine💜
This is beautiful 🎉
show!
aqui también te pienso
How can people hate on this angel
This is the kind of sound I’ve been inspired by in my own work. Huge respect!
One of the best tiny desk I have ever wathched. But please NPR, force me to watch 4,5,6  adds at the beginning if neccesary but, for the love of god, DO NOT INTERRUPT THE VIDEO WITH ADS!!!
That was very nice. Thank you for sharing and rocking out as always. Stay awesome and live well
She is super pretty and very talented but she also seems very shy and vulnerable and you want to hug her and tell her not to worry, that everything will be okay, that she is safe with you...
Her singing voice is so beautiful.
the first song is so melancholic it is a cure to my depression...
I'm old, but I like her and her brother's music because besides it being good, it's real.  No auto-tune, no overproduction, not the same beats that are in far too many other songs these days, etc.
Ahora se que no me dice nada Billie; no sabía si era hombre o mujer. 🥱
Wow I don't think I've ever stopped to read the description of a tiny desk concert but I did this time around and I'm glad I did. Well written.   Amazing song choices and performances. Much love.
Shame the instruments, particularly the acoustic guitar, were getting clipped.
She is brilliant.
Beautiful Billie
goatesque
That was so beautiful Billie!💙💙
I’m late to the Billie train but she’s definitely top ten artist I’ve ever heard.
I thinks the industry doesn’t want to put Billie over Taylor Swift but she’s definitely got it.
there is no way shes LAUGHING whilst im here crying
Billie's impeccable, every single note is so precise. ❤
❤
Whoah.  So many layers and hearing her voice like this..... whoah.  Anyone else hear Emmy-Lou Harris quality to her voice at times?
I love you guys
I get goosebumps with every song, I LOVE IT!! <3
she out of key, shaky, and why not do the belt at the end of 'birds of a feather'. I don't want to see yall ever call her a vocalist.
Cette version acoustique de Bird of Feather !! Unolugged lui donne une autre dimension
In think im in love bro shes f beautiful
11:55 god i wanna cry. This performance is just beautiful, a matter of fact the entire thing was just breathtaking. I felt overwhelmed of how beautiful this was😭😭🤍
What a treat and feast for the ears! Billie, you and your voice are beautiful and I love the harmony.  You two have the perfect tones to harmonize!  I didn't know he is your brother! It's no wonder that you have this musical chemistry and you have such comfort when you sing! OMG, I love this!
Eilish is an ill-liberal liberal, much like NPR.
Seriously man.....I'm a fully grown 41 year old man and I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes. Billie and Finneas, you're both truly truly gifted. Your voices, lyrics, arrangements....everything. Just so touching and enchanting. Thank you for the experience 💙
Those harmonies ❤❤❤
hoping for a frank ocean tiny desk some day
Only Billie could sing about rotting in a casket and make it sound beautiful and romantic. xD
So good!
guitar, drum and piano wat a perfection
the whole band and vocal is the art
Ima need Lana Del Rey to do one of these !!! Tiny desk ASK HER
Billie I carry a guilt that I have trapped you, an angel, an electron, a planned eternal uncertainty, an unlimited shape, to be an angel, an election, a planned eternal uncertainty, and an unlimited shape inside a fancy pictorial ...
Canta demais
Everyone talking about grammy. I’m so happy she didn’t get any. That means she didn’t make music they want. She made the music she and the people want. I hope she doesn’t get any grammy. Keep her expression hers. Such beautiful artistry.
freaking talented people!!
It works both, to clear the mind and make everything lighter <3
I love you has to be the best song ever ❤
so amazing¡¡ their voice their music is so beauty¡¡¡
I know I seen @booqooo
12:53 WHAT IN THE WOOOOORLD
I Cried for the first time since I was 8 years old
soooo beautiful 🫀
I just get lost in her voice, it's just an ethereal trip to a land of peace that just scratches that spot in my brain in the best way possible! She is absolutely gorgeous and beautiful inside and out I truly love her ❣️
qué maravilla....
Que coisa linda!
😘😘😘
Zoned out, in my feelings, when suddenly... MERGE 2 LEVEL 1 HULK MELONS!!!
💃🏻🙏🏼🪶
her singing in the right key right after finneas gives it to her and her hitting it spot on is impressive asf
Hey npr, betterhelp has hipaa problems
Piel de gallina un porotooooooo 😍😍😍 te amo billieeeee
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What an angelic voice.
6:44  song 2  11:54 song 3 18:25 song 4
SMASH
ugh im sick and tired of seeing u everywhere but right by my side, u hurt me so bad gimme a little lovin
For real, if you grew up during the 90s, this HITS. I always loved Billie Eilish and i have immense respect for her brother. But gosh, this hits home, i remember when i first watched Alice in Chains unplugged and Portishead Live at Roseland on my tv back in the day, that was immense and ever since then we lost that contact that gladly NPR Music team keeps going.
SUPER NICE::::WOULD LOVE BILLIE TO DO THIS WITH SNARKY PUPPY
I'm hooked
I've definitely re-watched this more than 100 times. Doechii is incredible
Great performance 👏  it's a shame that the last song made #1 because it was arguably the worst song of the whole set - and that says less about Eilish and more about our culture.
Só falta Twenty One Pilots no NPR!
Not the mid-roll ad 😂
如听仙乐耳暂明
Not the NPC in the corner lol
You don't get offered a Bond Movie Title Track if are not truly talented...
Lovely, lovely
Nunca voy a perdonar a la academia de los grmmays que no le dieron el album del año , con tan hermosa musica que nos dios billie ❤
Жаба без голоса
Yo le dedique este tema a mi novio y ni se acuerda me odia y ahora está jugando a un juego hentai like y me mato 'i love You"
אגדההה🔥🔥
😺💚🌱✅✌🌬💋
É indescritível o quanto Birds of a feather eleva minha autoestima na primeira batida ❤.
okay but billie adapting the song for the environment is just MMM like YESSS
Love It ❤
Their harmonies hit different. An album, please!
I'd like to shout out the writer of this video's caption. Truly heartfelt and thought-provoking words there! (Hope it wasn't AI, lol.)

Wow what a beautiful set of voices to listen to while creating and designing websites. beautiful billy.
What I like about these more intimate performances is that faintly constipated look on Billie’s face as she shuts her eyes and feels what she sings. The brother/sister dynamic is great too, created by them, no pushing parents, spent their youth together homeschooled, very heartwarming. Finneas has a great renaissance man vibe going.
That's so kewl. Her brother is with her always. I'm sure that comforts her while in tour
birds of a feather 18:16
Never understood the hype around Billie , but after hearing wildflower , the algorithm led me to this , she’s certified now 💯.. I like Billie too❤️
I love everything about this woman
meh
❤ l’amour de ma vie
4:10 she sings as if she's about to yawn 😂😂😂
Tiny Desk is perfect for Billie ♥
I need her and Damien Rice to do a song together
She deserved a grammy
i sobbed with i love you came on wasn’t expecting that
Billie is more precious than any Grammy FR ❤
since when Kevin de Bruyne start playing guitar?
I literally turned this on as a joke because I always stop Billie eilish had no talent. Admittedly I never actually looked into her. I'm absolutely blown away by how talented she is. Absolutely blown away
Dios!!! Placer a los oídos escucharla ❤
Listening to wildfire like this gives me goose bumps, e v e r y t i m e 😭😭😭😭😭🫠🫠🫠🫠
IM CRYING!!!!!!!!
One of the best recording. So soft and simple, but not simple
rends l'argent

billie eilish+stephen sanchez needs to be a thing..
+1 for the supported
Didn't knew a lot of songs of her, but while I was listen to it for the First time the first song hit me like a meteorite burning my lungs that was out of air, echoing in wild thoughts.. and It bring me back to my reality making me realize what I really don't know to me at the moment, so thanks for this moment ..
Her voice does not seem real!! Even after watching tiny desk I'm in awe of her voice! It's like butter so smooth so unique - UGH, amazing!!
THANK YOU NPR TINY DESK for showing us artists in their true form. This is literally the first time I see her "unplugged" and I love it so much 😍 I might just be a fan now
0:40 imagine making Billie look at you like that
와… 에코 전혀없는데… 라이브 장난없디
beyonces the devil
I'm not crying, you are. 🥺
I got in this hole of amazing Billie proformances. Sofa king awesome!
Sorry, but "saudade" is much deeper, intense and more than this. Beautiful concert, though.
She is amazing
❤❤❤
Myyyy girl
Love❤🇲🇽
why is the band dressed so awkwardly, they look like 14 year olds going to church, i don't understand
What a voice.
And this happened on my birthday. Thank you for the wonderful gift.
Love it!!! Thank you.
18:12 births os the feather ❤
8:28  BUM BUM BUMM
I think shes got a hairstyle type
When is Eilish going to do something worth listening to?  It's all been trash so far.
The 6 of wands 🔥
and shes is "just a teenager with auto-tune". Riiiiiiiight.
Jazz, pop, and rock all in one
Billie, u are the best!!!! i love youuuuuu
I knew the first time I heard "I Love You", and someone told me this girl was only 16 or 17 at the time, that she was a true artist. She is brilliant and I'm sure we have yet to see the height of her creativity and beauty.
17:21 haha real
I love it, I so love how she keeps her brother by her side. Keep up the good work my lady❤
This channel's Anamaria Sayre's description of this Tiny Desk experience with Billie Eilish was apt. Billie Eilish, as per usual, provided us with a fantastic performance. 💙✨️
La voz del guitarrista desmerece mucho la interpretación de Billy en birds of a feather. Me gastaría escuchar solo su voz, sin la de el.
I was supposed to do my homework while listening the tiny desk in the background, I ended up with my eyes glued to the screen and filled with tears of the emotions
do you think her brother hates her ? I feel bad he is not getting as much attention. :(
Nostálgico
Tiny Desck Concerts are the only ones I can afford to see, but I'm saving for the real thing.
Melted in the concert 😭😭😭
Beautiful....❤
Bravo The O'Connells
She needs white bandmates.
This is my first time listening to a live performance of hers and I love it. I’ve been listening since 2018 and it’s been cool to see her evolve. I listened through the new album only once and it didn’t do much for me but this performance makes me want to revisit it.
She Just Gotta Have Her Brother Right There All These Depressing Songs😂🤦🏽‍♀️
love her sooo much
4 Different songs, all generally about the same thing. Sadly not many writers who write about stuff that acutally matters today like Bob Dylan. Nice ear candy though.
Peaceful
Slow ride take it easy beat
11:52 - I love you ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
So beautiful!! Thank you Tiny Desk.
🥹❤️
<3
She touched my heart. Her live performances are the best after florence welch.
what is the name of the first song?
Beautiful voice 😍
Her tiny desk performance was just perfection!
8:29 🔥🎶
15:58 That note change, ugh 😩
Hey, Tiny Desk. Long time no see, I was missing these concerts...
Now, Lola Young: Tiny Desk, please.
i love the Token in the bass. Randy got a new mask.
billie, you are light.
She is my queen
She is the best Artist out there. Fax.
wow
Her song “I love you” makes me cry every time I hear it!
I LOVE Billie Ellish!
Breathtaking.  In every single way.  Tiny Desk is single handedly rescuing true musicality. Thank you.
I am upstairs alone in my creative room and simply blown away listing to this intimate concert. I want to thank your parents for blessing the world with   the two most gifted, true pure hearted souls Billie and Finneas. Love the guys in the band, everyone is awesome!
Vsfd Tiny Desk bom do caramba, no repeat a semana toda
she so broken , heal the girl
The great performance!
Beautiful 🎵🎼🎵🎼🎼🎵❤❤❤
Absolutely  un fu♤€•k•ING believable..love it..
❤
they are spectacular
Just seeing a big brother back up his little sister is so pure.   It also helps that he's very talented in his own right. ❤
WOW
finneas's backing vocals makes the songs prettier and more soothing to listen
Wow, Rock guy here, her voice is amazing. Well controlled to express exactly her feelings, sincere.
pure talent
i love this person just all around she’s truly rare in every way
Billie just melts me. She just gets better and better. What a gift of Phineas & Billie. ❤❤❤
Last one was not so good ))
Dear people. You already had people that are the actual voice of saudade. This is something else. But not saudade.   A Portuguese.
Beautiful ❤
♥
18:27 ❤❤❤❤❤
I liked this so much I tried to double tap the screen
When two geniuses spawn in the same household
My good God Billie makes me cry every time....this is so beautiful ❤ thank you for all of your amazing and beautiful storytelling in song.  Seriously the most amazing artist and person....prayers to you and yours Billie, we all struggle and you're amazing at holding yourself together and I hope and pray you're doing good and your family is well and you heal from anything that ever troubled you❤
Anyone else catching the guitar line from ‘Everybody’s Talking At Me’ in ‘Birds of a Feather’?  Beautiful set, mind. What a talent. 😊
12:37 They don’t know how every time that I heard them, my heart melts so much. They with me in all my phases, love you guys.💗
She was so ROBBED at the Grammy.  Beyonce doing country beat THIS? we need a recount.  She is an absolute ANGEL.
Guitar is amazing, they're perfection together. Siblings make the best artist's
Please bring Shakira to it!
Better help?? While I’m listening to Billie??
D’ingueriiiiiiiiiiiiiii ❤❤❤
why is she so off timing for "i love you." she drags out words where they shouldnt be and throws the whole thing off
I think billie eilish is half asian, because the way she choose her outfit in every perform so polite and beutifull.
All the hype around her. I get that now. Definitely one of the biggest talent in this era. She’ll go down as one of the biggest artists of all time.
And now the Monster Trump and Fascist Musk are coming for NPR!
Why does ehe sctually have a similar voice to me?!!!
She has such a pretty and unique  voice ❤❤❤😢😢
Can someone help me understand what is supposed to be so great about BE music? It all sounds the same. Where are the dynamism, the surprises, the variation in instruments, tones, and feelings, the change in mood (always dark and moody)?
I love her so much❤
I try. But I can’t listen to her very long.
😭👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 absolutely beautiful.
Amazing!!
Magical! ✨❤️
❤🫵🏽🥰
nice she not that good live dam
billie & finneas 🥹
i love her....I didnt know shes this amazing
Billie & Finneas were ripped off at the Grammys 😭 such a shame
A beleza dessa mulher é sem condições, fora a voz neh, um espetáculo de se assistir
So true these NPR shows have introduced me to so many artist I had never heard and I’m thankful for that. Speaking of unplugged Nirvanas unplugged is my favorite of all time holla
True talent keeps is simple
billie and the band are incredible!!!!
auto-generated caption failed to understand the words!
Ok without a doubt this was the most TALENTED album of the year!!! Sorry you didn't get a gram, hope you don't care as much as I do Billie! I love you!!!
I love you Billie Eilish
NPR is just for the smart people -- like you want to market to the intellectuals, do a Tiny Desk cause we keep it all in our Big Heads.
i love Tiny Desk but BetterHelp... that's problematic.
Im sorry I didn’t listen 🎧 to your new album Billie… I just couldn’t keep up with you in your sad state/ I’m not happy with myself & listening to sad music 🎶 isn’t good for my mental health 🖤🖤🖤
Try listening to this when you’re going to sleep—I swear it’s the closest experience to heaven you’ll ever get.
so bad
18:27 birds of feather ❤
what kind of guitar is playing Finneas at the 6:01? is a kind of telecaster but the model?
❤❤
Imagine having a sibling like Finneas. The genius behind your success but only ever accents your talent as subtly as possible and could not be happier to see you shine. True love ❤
🍯
Jesus Christ.
so yummy!!!
Tiny desk concerts always make me appreciate artists even more. I love you is so beautiful
Came here cause I love Tiny Desk, really only 'knew of' Billie through a gf.  I'm a 44 year old man and listen mostly to Radiohead, LCD Soundsystem etc... but now I'm effing crying after "I Love You", wow what a pair of talented siblings, just beautiful
Sister & Brother, Dynamic Duo😊♀️😇🛡️🫶🎥🧈🍿🌐🫶🌎🏆🥞🏠🎸⭐💫✨🌟
Billie 🥰🥰🥰
i love you
The paramore influence is strong.
Doing what's right without a reward
She’s SOOOO pretty!!
excellent artist with a beautiful voice ❤
Now I wanna know what the inside joke is with the “oooh” from i love you
Billie Eilish is a great example of someone who I can really like their style, music, personality and yet not agree with their political positions, and I THINK thats a pretty underrated way of being.
i cried during i love you lol
Que cambiada está nicky nicole
😊🙃
Day 62 of exclusively listening to this
How refreshing to see an artist be truly talented without vocal / sound assistance. I'm on the B. Eilish Train now.
She is such an underrated artist, it is unbelievable...imagine one day she might win top single at BBC Radio 1.
Coming back to this tiny desk for about the twelfth time, especially after Billie didn't take home any Grammys for this EXCELLENCE.
her live performances always hit
Holy Glory Alleluia Amen Gõttlichkiet Heiligkeit Divinity Allways! ❤️
Billie's voice is so pure like a natural water from its source
i'm still upset about her album not getting any single award !!%#^@*@* HIT ME HARD AND SOFT DESERVED 😤
Natural talent!
I love this sibling so much! <3 <3 <3 <3
you are such a lovely
Such a lovely voice
Biebers bassist
Greatest
This was amazingggggg!!!! Billie is just so talented, beautiful, and stunning, and i love her and brother's bond, so beautiful
I love Billie so much and this version of the greatest is beautiful ❤️
She deserves all the Grammys! She’s so dang talented!!!
11/10
🤡🤡🤡🤡😷😷😷😷🤮🤮🤮🤮
Her vocal control ( especially on I Love You ) is outstanding.
U rock
perfeccion en ella
First song hurts more when you thing in your mom and not in a man
the greatest!!!
15:32 the way she says dying just hits perfect fr.
billie eilish and aurora are my best faves 🤍
@ameliavilona
what chords were used for the first part of the song? and which strings were being plucked?
Words can't convey how truly great these two are - can't get enough
please do Charlotte Cardin!!
she has vocals but for sure her parents money got her where she is
This is a stolen idea.
Stunning. Gorgeous. Love this ❤
KEYBOARD PLAYER LOOKS LIKE A FANNY
she's a god!
Love the brightness and light emanating out of her strings! Amazing. ❤
WOW... She`s amazing...I`m in love... And the fact they`re brothers and write together in a tiny bedroom since the beginning...Wow...Amazing! Congrats both of them!
Yo Billie slayed (dhat). She and her band make amazing music.
0:33 - the greatest 6:44 - l'amour de ma vie 11:53 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Billieのtiny deskのパフォーマンスめちゃめちゃ大好き
First time really sitting down and listening to Billie, oh boy do i have some listening to do.
Sooooo    beautiful
Stunning stunning stunning adore her
I Love her voice so much. The songs are so Beautiful, Heartbreaking. Sometimes it’s the quietest songs say more than the loud voices that stretch to back row.❤❤❤
Music is my therapy.. Thank you all :.)
love uuu billsssssss
I absolutely love the Tiny Desk series. Absolutely brilliant. That said, please get a different sponsor. NPR is awesome. This sponsor tarnishes you, badly.
sempre me emociono ouvindo ela, incrível demais, no words needed!!!!!!!
why does a legacy nepo baby get a crown but the best music assembler of our generation is by himself.?
You’re sad excuse for human being like he used people for everything that they🎉😢
# Billie Eilish why do you try to make people sad for no reason like I don’t get that about you? Why are you trying to make people miserable
i absolutely love this sibling duo, finneas is always there for his amazing sister
She’s too famous to be on NPR tiny desk anymore
8:29 Sent me straight to Heaven!!! What a Drop!!!
The best band😻
Hate commercials in the middle of a song.  Kills my vibe lol
3:20 I’ve never heard something so pure and beautiful in my life.
me causas paz con tu hermosa voz ☼
Omg i cant take that much talent 😢❤ amazing
She was robbed from best album Grammy 😢😢
grammys is rigged Jay z for real payed /:
Ugh my heart , I feel every word 🥺 Godbless her and her brother for giving us beautiful songs with such beautiful voices
i’ve cried the whole way through
This is how I like finding out if I’ll like an artist or not. In this occasion I fell in love w Billie
no grammy is crazy
My 72 year old mom said “Am I a Billie fan?!?” and then told me the names of her band members
Do your best interest Bangladesh show me more blink!
ex-police chief escaped from this country is their father's harmony when they know he has been hooked by the Police intelligence in Australia for his corruption 2022 in Au wonder how did they let him go? Through Bangladeshi Police channel. What do they want is the question. They are phenomena by DODGE media! Dodging innocence
6:21 Wow 😍
So gifted and beautiful. ❤️
Marty friedman on drums! 😅
'pleaseeee have Lana Del Rey on here :')
Love you Billie 💓💓💓
I feel sick that hmhas didn’t get a single Grammy😭 I hope they continue with making things that they enjoy! If all us fans could’ve voted they’d of won the lot ❤
영혼이 맑은사람이네요..치유가 됩니다. 빌리의 어쿠스틱 음반을 간절히 기다려봅니다💌
oh god, this is music
very good !!! <3
I was a Music Prof for 11 years and this is Saudade AF 💖
15:48 Finneas making sure Billies alright is always my favourite part whenever they perform i love you.
La voz de esta morra Es irreal!!! ❤❤❤
She deserved that album of the year award
que hermosa esta piba. es una locura, esto esta muy bien.
for me personally? not being very hip to billie. She has earned a new fan due to her beautiful voice. I had no clue.
This girl should have won every Grammy 😭
Man she sucks
The most boring thing ive tried to get through.
15:19 why they laugh?
18:26 Birds Of A Feather
Sorry this is my first Tiny Desk, is this show like the BBC Radio? Or is so diferent the concept? Thank please dont hate 🩷🫶🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 Help!!!!!!
Also an ad in the middle of I love you is crazy
Perfection ❤
beautiful
This tiny desk is so good I was supposed to pause it so I could go get me something to eat ended up finishing the video 🤣🤣🤣 yess Billie sing girl🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm here for Kai Cenat
She’s brilliant
Great 👏💯
❤
wow. just wow.
Amerikaliklar bunchalik iste'dodli va ijodkor bo'lishmasa a, shunchaki qoyil! xa aytgancha, bu yerdagi javonga O'zbekiston bayrog'i ham juda yarashgan bo'lar edi, rahmat!
There is something both intangible and ethereal to the music of Billie and Finneas, and yes I'm in my seventies! ♥♥
Okay Billie gives me goosebumps. Also, someone PLEASE tell me what formula she uses for her hair colour because this is the colour I have been wanting for years
Not a Billie Eilish fan at all. Until now.
her singing I love you was the hardest thing I had to watch all year
I wish my sister's would make music with me. Oh, well — at least my son will! 😁
Она точно певица?
Great brother she's got there.
There is no way this wasnt the grammy album of the year
Mine brother
What guitar is Finn playing?
Overrated artist 🥱
Wonderful Billie , can't wait to see u live in April in Denmark
Is it weird that I think that Abe looks like an Abe, Andrew looks like an Andrew, Solo looks like a Solo, Finneas looks like a Finneas, and of course, Billie is very Billie.
She was robbed from winning a Grammy 😫
OMG! Billie and Finneas are the greatest musical duo today. The arrangements of the songs here are so fine, the piano sounds just perfect and sweet. Finneas sensibility is superb and shows in each composition. While Billie’s voice is the sweet and soulful, perfect ❤
Her first Tiny Desk was during Covid and she had the Tiny Desk bookshelf photographed and recreated behind her. So finally she made it to the right place!
Billie is animated and gorgeous 🤣😍😍😍
This took me on a journey. Such an incredible tiny desk. Billie understood what tiny desk was about when she showed up for this and I got very emotional lol
Me recordó a Alanis Morrisette en sus inicios 😍❤. Muchos éxitos le esperan a esta pequeña👏🏻👍🏻💪🏻🙏🏻
Bille deserved to win ….!
Her voice is so beautiful
A young Hillary Cliton
She is amazing ✨
didn't get the hype until now...mad respect.
Stunning. We miss you in Spain. We love you. That was a special version and we felt it. Sleeeeeeeeep. You deserve it. Hugs to your bro. Xx
More than happy to see her dressed as a decent human being
BUM BUM BUM!!!!!!
Billie is great. There's no denying. But Finneas deserves credit too.
Watching this again and figuring out why this album never received a single Grammy
The love of my life 🥺❤️
❤ maravillos@
She is so fu*king talented.....
Does anyone know what guitar finneas is playing on?
Great even if youtube has to learn to stop placing ads in the middle of a song
When music hits for me, I get goosebumps. Her voice does that for me
Plot twist , Billie didn’t win because she’s the greatest singer of all time and they need her to do the thang. If they give her a Grammy now she won’t purse the greatest song of all time. Maybe they think she has something in her that isn’t ready to be rewarded. She hasn’t done it yet , she will make one of the greatest songs of all time , I believe it. She’ll come back harder
This concert brought me to tears so good. The music just flowed out of her like water
wow
There is no way, i got an ad in the middle of a tiny desk ._.
I Looooooove Billie
❤
so beautiful
its imposible this isnt the album of the year
👏👏👏👏great
HER VOICEEEE 😩💗
It's a shame they didn't win a Grammy. Should have been AOY.
I just don't like how she whispers
Her voice ugh it just instantly brings tears to my eyes you can just feel every word
Superbe!
That’s why I don’t giveth my surrender or submissions.
I really like her voice but wish she would project more. Difficult to hear her over instruments even on the radio
"THE LOVE OF MY LIFE" -  the answer to DON'T THINK TWICE IT'S ALRIGHT, it finally was revealed after all these decades or in her next reincarnation...
My favourite Billie Eilish song is the one where she does that sad-whisper-singing thing.
hear me out, doesn't she look like a real life hyuga clan member?
Bilie Eilish doesn't really fit in with the tiny DEesk Concert. Even in its most organic version it sounds very commercial
this is sooo beautiful i love her live
Another fantastic TDC! Fabulous set, and great musicianship from everyone.  🤩
The primitive and nihilistic praise of lies, another example of the death of today's culture.
This is the first time I've heard some of these songs, and don't know whether it's chord progression or what but 'I love you' sounds so similar to 'Hallelujah', or is it just me?!
Tiny desk is the best that could happen to music lovers, hands down!❤
Come on, why put ads in the middle of a song?
Ads in the middle of a song is freaking diabolical 😭
Of the 14 million views, I think 2 million are mine
She is so beautiful ❤
I cried during the grammys!
I can’t believe this is NPR doing this lol idk why I’ve jus always thought of them as old folks talk radio bc my gpa
This will be me when it delivers to my house
Shes only 23
The fact birds of a feather didn't win song of the year is a crime.
She sings like a literal angel. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a more beautiful voice.
I’d love to see Gable Price and Friends on Tiny Desk!
questo tuo cercare di evitare un contatto visivo ti rende ancora più attraente 😘  splendida
I love this version of you…
18:08
they kinda ripped off the leona lewis famous hit, apart from that cool concert and cool artists
Cleanrx pstodoirxteeteat9
That second song hit home for me 😢.
I know it call Tiny Desk Concert but that's one of biggest desk I've seen with so many great artists  behind it, lol.
I want you to stay 'Til I'm in the grave 'Til I rot away, dead and buried 'Til I'm in the casket you carry  If you go, I'm going too, uh 'Cause it was always you, alright And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me Nothing left to lose without my baby  Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone Can't change the weather, might not be forever But if it's forever, it's even better And I don't know what I'm crying for I don't think I could love you more It might not be long, but baby, I  I'll love you 'til the day that I die 'Til the day that I die 'Til the light leaves my eyes 'Til the day that I die
Just wow... I've been following you for 5 years and it's been such a treat seeing you grow. Keep being your amazing you!
My 2025 Grammy winner ❤
She should’ve sung wildflower 😭💜
Elhamdulilah ❤
Great role model and music… but an artist should never speak on politics with a biased opinion I’m out
I love how lovely her lyrics are, but she's so awkward when she talks 😅
Just hear to cry heal my heart cause the grammys did her dirty
❤
Bring Birdy, pleasee
Billie and Finneas you have my heart forever
Dang I feel ashamed... I only listened to LUNCH and kind of "forgot" to listen to the rest of the album... I see I've been missing out
I really wonder if Billy ever cries when she writes her music, sometimes it hits me so hard I can''t help but cry. I love her music so much
Yesss Billie!!! YOU ATE❤
How didn't this when 1 Grammy? Lol
lah cewe gua
As Portuguese, I loved the description of the video!!! It perfectly captures the feeling that many songs give us! Great Billie! <3
이거몰래카메라죠..?
she deserves a fking grammy
UFFFFFFFFFF!
The voice of the brother on the last song does not compliment Billie's voice. Can she please get a female vocalist to back her up!!😭😭 Please!
Billlieeeee taps into my inner white galllll and im samoan 😭😭😭😭🫶🫶🫶🫶
Real music, real talent. Minimal, if any, production. Absolutely brilliant.
These two!
I'm 5mây
She just moans sometimes
so beautiful <3
I don’t get it at all. 😴  Makes no sense.
2:29 voice of an angel😮
sza NEXT please
Her voice is out of this world
This is the BEST tiny desk concert of all times
Wow
This isn't just music. It's pure art ♡
How unfair it was that my baby didn't win a Grammy, she sings with so much feeling
La voz del tipo nada que ver…
the greatest make me cryyyyy huhuuu
I love you Billie
here after the traumatic grammy abomination. billie deserved album of the year; every song hits perfectly.
The best band🎉😮❤
❤
Coming back to this knowing that it should have absolutely swept the Grammys
Un vrai concert à emporter sur NPR!
The birds of a feather arrangement here is fs the best one so far
Jeez. This is amazing
Like if you also think she was robbed at this year’s Grammys
here again since  she didnt get her award at the grammy's
Proud Ngawi Girl!!!
I want ALL OF THAT on VYNIL please! Billie sounds like VYNIL
such a sweet voice 💞 love u, billie
she shouldve won a grammy
Loved the portuguese mention at the start of the description. It truly describes what her songs feel like. Love to Billie and NPR from Brazil
She’s so old school acoustic is the way to hear her
Aff como eu amo
Não sei dizer qual é mais Linda😊❤
she"s a gem; she was robbed y'day
traumatized that this album didn’t get a SINGLE grammy
Brilliant 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 😅😅❤
That sweet siren has the perfect band for her in this setting.
18:29 the best song of year!!!!
her wig
This was amazing
nice
I love Billie Eilish!! This made my entire night! ❤️❤❤❤💯
I wonder what Chrisy Hyde (Don't get Me wrong) things of Birds Of A Feather? But Billie and the band were fantastic!
love you and ur ocean eyes sm bae 🩵🍬
Wow. Her dreams came true. She wanted to be TinyDesk and it happened.
🔥🔥🔥
15,000 comment
I can't tell you how many times I have listened to this video over and over again she is so amazing and I love her ❤
she is a princess <3
I was cleaning the house listening to this on headphones, and only realised it was live when people started cheering all of a sudden  unreal
I think this is the second time I'm watching this video. Thank you so much for making this video, NPR Music. And Thank you to Billie and Finneas Eilish as well! I learned so much from watching the both of you! My favorite song is Birds of Feather. I wish I can learn the guitar tune and lucky enough I got a guitar now. His name is Bobby, short for Bob Dylan.
NPR!!!! Super lame: ADS!!! What? I PAY to have no ads. This is YouTube! Scummy, and especially on Billie's Tiny Desk. Geez! Gross. 😢
Beautiful 🎉🎉🎉 thank you Billie
This girl's voice is a gift. Wow.....chills
Maybe Fineas should just hum.
💜💜💜💜💜
got me crying in a laundromat 12:11
9:54   This is just Pure heaven
This presentation was one of the best of all time, bordering on perfection, instruments and vocals all in perfect harmony, in this day and age I never imagined seeing something so wonderful, Congratulations ❤️
Better help said I needed to much help so I didn't qualify (sad face)
I cried to Chihiro
The first act dem😂🙌🏿
Ethereal voice
So sad, so so boring
Wow 🎉🎉, I just discovered Billie, I see why ❤❤❤❤
Bom demais
I’ll be in your heart kurt
Still❤
Like your parents heard from far off her mom telling me her good love  Respect ❤and love
Hey fin if I could get in your good graces been there I can marry your sister❤
Billy you’re maybe don’t but do me
Finneas please shut up.
Having "US" Billie😉..sounds like the audience has gotten bigger in there ..uou all Sounds amazing
It reminds me of AMEL BENT but in English
She’s medieval
Shout out to the engineers, these TDC are sounding so good in recent years.  They should be available for purchase.
I don't know why, but her voice sounds like a velvet would feel. Smooth
22:34 Birds of a Feather sounded so different.
18:30 Birds of a Feather ❤
I love tiny desk, but these ada landing in the middle of a song SUCKS
I love you Billie, i love you Billie, i looooooooooooooove YOU BILLIE, I LOVE YOU, MY LITTLE ANGEL 😭
Her voice is so Haunting.  Touches your soul. ❤
can billie eilish songs be the new burlesque ?
how can anyone not fall in love with her?
Beautiful Bellie, why your songs are so depressive...
Basic singing ability at best...have yall watched this channel B4?  This aint tiny desk level talent.
I love Billie´s style of singing very, very much❤ Thank you💓
so beautiful, so natural, so talented, so humble.
🖤
hey guuys, does anyone know what kinda pickup finneas is using on his acoustic guitar?? hope everyone‘s having a good day☺️
fr crying
i love billie and finneas ❤
Love Billie👍
Gave me goosebumps
Listening to birds of a feather here makes me realise how heavily produced this album/song is. Dosent sound anything like the studio version, almost a different person signing it.
NPR is wonderful. Please no publicity in the middle of the songs !
She looks soo pretty❤❤❤
I love how her brother was looking at her while she sang the last song...they really love each other. Beautiful.
THE FUTURE QUEEN
6:44
This recording of them sounds something between a bit like Feist + Kings of Convenience and The Civil Wars and I'm loving it! 🫶
I'll never get over this.
Alright im officially a Billie Eilish fan.
Meh
22 minutos de pura felicidad ,gracias Billie por todo este año sin dudas formaste gran parte de mi vida y saludos desde Argentina ❤🇦🇷
Whoever didn't put the add breaks between songs is disrespectful.
❤
Time code :   0:22 - The Greatest 6:43 - L'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:26 - Birds of a feather
Why does she say shes been wanting to do this her whole life when she's already been on here?
Billie Eilish has got one of the crazziest pianos I've seen a singer do. Also so cute to see siblings sing together (so well)
The  concert was really nice and my grandson on the bass is really good.
I dont listen to them on spotifiy but I truly believe that they are one of the few that actually have talent
🤟🏽
Weird to know I grew up just a year younger than Billie. Someone who'll be remembered long into the future... I hope I can leave my mark too!
the way Finneas made the whole song 100 times better by the backup vocals. just wow.
So very beautiful 🎵🎸🎶
I come here everyday
Billie is the greatest WOW
I absolutely love to not just listen but to see you play and sing. It’s so clean. I am floored every time
It's called "Fear of Flying" and don't worry... One day you'll fall in love with God then you'll REALLY be in trouble!!! LOL... LOVE YOU BILLIE!!! yr So awesome.  Love to your brother too... NEVER STOP!
Anyone else wanna see Billie Eilish make up a song on the spot?! I wanna be the fly on that wall😅🤭
0:31 The greatest 6:46 l’amour de ma vie 11:55 i love you 18:30 birds of a feather
10/10
Finneas is beasting
I loved Finneas' solo Refrain at the end of Birds Of A Feather. 😭🤍
i hate how every time billie sings i gotta put it on max volume just to hear or understand half of what she says
"I love you" at Tiny Desk - just amazing!
her voice is so angelic and i love that shes so authentic.
Loved this performance ❤
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
♥
15:52 the way she said "I love you"...
I used to say she's overrated......NOW I'M A FAN!
Songs
Subhanallah
Freaking tears peeps. Lots of tears. Amazing session ❤
A melhor, the best 🤍
I just imagined the first song from the perspective of an abandoned dog and now I'm sobbing
Thats the longest ive heard them clap for an artist after the first song
Yey, it's time for Billie
This is one of the greatest singers of the new generation...
She's amazing. ❤
she's so pretty and her voice is <3 <3 😍
Удивительно, как просто можно заработать, следуя вашим советам.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Think about it, civil wars 💯
Does it not remind you of civil wars 😮
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather ❤❤❤❤❤
Spotify we need this ASAP on a playlist
one of the most controlled vocalists of our time.
Perfect 😍

My husband sent me a clip on insta.  But I didn't listen to it,  I just looked it up on here immediately and was blessed to get this treasure to keep in my head/ heart. 'I love you ' blew me away.  X
Thank you❤

Always love her music🎶 Love for India❤ Manifesting to perform at Tiny Desk Concert soon🎉
18:19
18:28
❤
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
The kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it
Why didn’t nobody tell me she can sang, I thought she was a singer or did pop or something. Child can sang sang breath control on point
💜💜
Fantastici! La bellezza della musica dal vivo!
i cried at the greatest 🥹 truly love her voice and the music is excellent. love them
The sound of her voice is levitating
I'd surely love to listen an acustic album by Billie Eilish
Why are people still pushing Better Help, when the world already knows how evil they are?
simply lovely
billie eilish kapan kowe konser meng indonesia kabar2 ya mampir mengumahku juga ngko tak kei sun sing suwe temenan
Bro I can die peacefully now thank god for tiny desk
Wow.... she's just so glorious it's actually hard to believe it's real. Just incredible.
Does anyone know any good small channels similar to this, I'm trying to beat the algorithm
Why it's too shot! Tiny desk, bring them back again.
There is literally something demonic about this girl. Look at her eyes (for whatever moments they are open). It’s crazy, she has issues.
May the person reading this be kept alive, thriving, safe, healthy & financially stable from everlasting to everlasting in the name of Mother Earth! Thank you in advance!
Amazing! Never heard her so near and natural. So good, love all of it and the band is faboulus!
I would love for Lana Del Rey to join you guys on tiny desk!!!😍
0:21 The greatest 6:45 L'amour de ma vie 11:53 i love you 18:27 Birds of a feather
She (and her brother too!) is sooo amazing, love her more now after watching this Tiny Desk concert!
This girl is truly amazing. And the band is dope
Just casually listening to this while working :3
Hear me out. NPR needs to release these masterpieces on Spotify!!  They're too good to stay just on Youtube!
We need Billie, may her and Finneas make music forever, because this is so beautiful.
Oh, Billie.
Can really hear the Beatles influence on the second track, absolutely outstanding
11:52 i love you
Why did I get 6 ads I just wanna hear her angelic voice
Her voice is amazing!!!!
i <3 her she makes me cry
Get MGK and Jelly Roll to Tiny Desk brothas
If you hate/don't like BE, i suggest you watching this tiny desk live. Amazing performance, amazing music, dedicated and talented. I don't care about anything but music.
11:53
this is art
It’s giving The Civil Wars in the BEST way
staaaaaaaph 😭😭😭 her voice is just so beautiful! This is quite literally the first Tiny Desk I've watched in its entirety only because its Billie💖
I agree on the description this really feels like saudades. As a brazilian i know what that word means and this tiny desk concert feels just like saudades. Y'all should call her again
How did I get here so late 🤦🏾‍♀️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love billie❤❤❤
Genial
I 💙 Billie
I love tiny desk .. and I LOVE billie eilish. Amazing.
Linda voz muy melodiosa
que mujer por dioss
THAT FACE CARD THOOOO
Can they just become Billie and Finneas already? They are clearly a team
6:24 18:25
18:21 ❤❤❤
Talent off the scales my gawddd
poco a poco va perdiendo sus rasgos adolescentes...
Billie.. la mujer que eres <3
님아ㅠ..ㅠ
BILLIE sounds the same live as the studio version. Incredible. she's so cool and talented
the glazers at 17:15 😭
I used to be unable to name a top musical artist. There are just so many good musicians out there, and each is talented in their own way. But Billie is just tops.
Grande Billie!! 🤩
Thank you "Tiny Desk"!
She is really good. So is her bro.Thanks Tiny Desk for introducing her to many of us. Heard of her in the news but didn’t know the how great a vocalist she is nor how beautiful. These Tiny Desks bring us some of the best musicians and vocalists and writers in a setting where their talent is just so mesmerizing at times, a viewer can focus on the art and beauty of what they do.
Can someone tell me the time signature at 4:20 ? Sounds so weird but i’m counting 4/4??
Adele, please
Better help sponsorship didn't age well :/
Sublime
Ugh. I wish this were 4 hours long.
pure beauty tender melodies
Insane
For adults by adults. the Betterhelp intro is a beautiful touch.
I have adored Billie from the very beginning. She is one of the most exceptional singers and perfomers of our era, and she remains so endearingly and adorably humble and gracious. And like the finest of wines, she seems to just keep getting better and better over time. I get so lost in her voice, her smile, and her breathtaking eyes. You are such a treasure, Billie. Keep being amazing you. ❤️👍❤️
We need a russ tiny desk !!
bill lee lee la :)
i find this music relaxing , loved it
8:25
"I'm also dressed like a girl it's so weird" no it's totally ok you are dressed like a professional chef and that is always gender agnostic  But I'm a fan of her usual ensemble which I think of as "kevin smith modern"  weirdly NONE of this is a dig
I love you keegan
Nada mejor que tener a tu hermano al lado cantando y mirándote❤
Such tender beauty and soulfulness but argh ... ads ... !!! you cant do that when a song is 30 seconds in!!!!!
I’m sorry dude but her brother just creeps me out. And I think my opinion will age well unfortunately. Something seems off with him
Billie mi ❤️‍🩹
So good
I love you Billie,i love your voice, beautiful songs and dancings ❤️❤️👏🏾🫶🏾😍
Oliver Dragojevic >D
beautiful
her whole life? Tiny desk has been out for how long?
15:25 😂
18:28 birds of a feather
It's incredible that in the middle of a beautiful song, YouTube puts on a commercial.
Their songs are just so beautiful.
Que voz fantástica!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Dunno about you guys but for me she's a wife material and a keeper
I’m BEGGING YOU PLZ have Bruno Mars on!
One of my faves
omfg that was visceral
I miss the old sound 😢
i need this on spotify
Hermoso ♡
18:29 the voice changing between the "common" and the beggining of the song is... just... Gosh!! Amazing!
18:30 birds of a feather
Love Billie ❤
i love this, its so good reccommend i love you 11:59
Never been a fan of this artist- still feel the same. Respectfully.
She’s the best
Jesus Christ the sound is inmaculated and crispy we need all the tiny desk concerts on Spotify
omg this is amazing
They are incredible together. Beautiful
Thank you very much 🙏❤️
Billie's voice😩😩😩
Amaizing! You best!
She should be a singer omg! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
billie how DARE you laugh while singing i love you i am sobbing over here 😭
Please, bring Elton John 🙏🏻
Anyone else get goosebumps during I love you? I admire her talent so much.
God, I just love this girl so much - so much much talent, emotional intelligence and swagger. I hope she keeps doing what she’s doing.
I used to love her until I realized she is a judgmental hypocrite
Billie your so awesome and beautiful  🤍
Ola! Did you heard Syyfeld & Ali? (Spotfy)🙏❤️
i would go crazy for melanie martinez  mini desk concert
Underrated song. Deserves to be played on repeat.
just brilliant
She's so blessed for her brother ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not a fan of hers, but this is very good. Great sound
you'd still know this was special... and wanna hear it...
this  Unplugged is amazing, whit the perfect time to pout other instrument,
Goodness gracious I had no idea
Te amo @Billie ellish y es a la única artista que quiero conocer después de escuchar birds of the feather quien no 😢 , increible performance ❤🎉
she has the most amazing vocals ive ever heard
Not sure about the children's guitar
0:21 The Greatest 6:43 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 I Love You 18:26 birds of a feather
She’s actually got one of the most beautiful voices I’ve ever heard in my life. Unbelievable

6:44 ❤
always coming back
insane unreal speechless..
I don’t know how they keep their composure. If I was performing with my brother, I’d take one glance at him and start laughing.
I see why this girl is such a big deal. I'm late on the train but I'm here now.
Her voice is heavenly😭 it’s so beautiful❤️‍🔥
Her voice is so airy and ethereal.
i love you
i love you had me floored wow
@ARRahman sir can we have your performance at Tiny Desk. @NPR Music hope you can afford him
it's fitting that the worst song by far is the one that's #1....
So proud of this young lady. Truly gifted! Sings effortless! This is a Whitney Houston in voice! Beautiful VOICE.
A Bichinha é SINISTRA! top demais.
❤️
She sings sharp
I was here before people started referring to Tiny Desk as the new MTV Unplugged. And as someone who's experienced both. yes it is. 💯
Enchanting.
wow she was really feeling these songs i hope she's doing well
Congratulations Billie and Finneas... This Álbum is a Freakin Masterpiece !
I am already on my last reason youtube. Not today.
15:30 I am crying
The crowd or audience in the background aren't usually this loud for any other artists, my feelings would be hurt lol
Please invite Damien RIce.
Gosh she is brilliant. Lucky to have her talented brother by her side as well.
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
She is a far left democrat.  No thanks.

Too short!!!!
Quelle gueule de tox qu'elle a......
She is once in a generation

Billie
I almost forgot to watch this today
She sounds amazing ❤ 👏
I mean npr is poison
Fantastic as always! <3
não consigo não amar ela ksksks
Best female voice around
I swear, only family can sound this good.  The melodies are so sophisticated, yet playful.
She sings so well live
Billie, the sound of your voice is wwooonderrrfull !!!! S2
The reality of this channel is odd.
she had to sneeze 😭 14:53
HAHA olhem o começo da descrição: " Saudade" Salveeee BR
Shame on NPR for accepting a sponsorship from such a reprehensible company. Better Help takes advantage of people in need of mental health support, and has been caught selling their private medical info to advertisers. Please don't advertise for them. It hurts your viewers.
She is definitely overrated… 😎 I love “birds of a feather”! They should’ve gave that song to someone else.
Didn't really appreciate her voice until this tiny desk.  So angelic.
tiny desk is simply amazing  but i would like to see the audience as well  - just for a moment, really corious
There's no way I see a Billie Eilish tiny desk session and not click
Billie is just plain ASTOUNDING!
Birds of a feather is so good❤
I’ve always thought her brother is in love with her 😂
i love her so much
so good
❤
6:46 love it when these babies know their musical appreciation and history and truly appreciate the honor it is to be featured on this show. ❤❤❤❤
I just love how considerate the band is, playing low enough to not overpower her voice it sounds so perfect
I only knew the Barbie song by Billie...wow I was in for a surprise here, she can really sing!
never realized how much i needed billie eilish on acoustic mode. this is everything.
6:45
Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas deserve all accolades. They are timeless. I am also almost 70, been a musician all my life and creatively no one can really beat her or her brother in this time period.
5 fantastic musicians, you guys!
theyyy gotttsss to get brunooooo  on here 😩
WOW, most heartfelt new music I have heard, thank you!
Totally enjoyable . Not disappointed
Wonderful! Please stop getting money from Betterhelp! Predatory Service!
If life had the consciousness of a God, Billie Eilish would deserve as a reward for this song, Birds of a feather, the most beautiful love story. 💜

La amoooo.... 😍😍😍
6:43
I love tiny desk concerts ♥️✨️😚
This is so angelical
WOW！太棒了！
Cool!!!
My favourite song from 2024. So good, love the harmonies, guitar riff, bass, etc
8:28 OMG THE “immediately….BUM BUM BUM” SHE SOUNDS SO PERFECT
"When we all" etc. is not your debut album....there is a red tranparent piece of vinyl on my 1976 Technics to prove it 😂. And we need a Billie and Finneas Unplugged album as nr. 5, preferably recorded at Sound City. How you dropped like casual into "Birds" was remarkable.
"When we all" etc. is not your debut album....there is a red tranparent piece of vinyl on my 1976 Technics to prove it 😂.
Billie es perfecta pero me encanta la voz de su hermano también ❤
this really put me on to her music. I normally don't dig this stuff but its all there. lyrics, harmonies, timing.... its all there. Perfect
❤
Do you realise how much emotion Billy is investing in these performances, and I bet she means every word and emotion in each and every verse.This is the real thing no fakery here.
I stumbled on this and, wow, this version is pure genius and vocal prowess.
Fenomenal, tremenda , magistral presentación de mejor , BILLIE, Graciss
Her voice is stunning.
This easy best sound production i heard on youtube aside new Dre. Snoop album :D
Nerves always ruin everything. You all slayed
Oh Dear Billie. Thank you❤
She was a little bit nervous and i love how she can be so human its beautiful , she is my favorite artist , love Finneas support ❤❤❤
I like the concept ,so georges
Forever love her voice ❤
beautiful
Love of my life song is killer! <3
she rendered me speechless i love her
This Tiny desk is one of my favorites. Amazing Billy and band <3
Best tiny desk performance ever. Think about it, it’s true
I want to know what mic that is on the acoustic guitar. I'm pretty sure it's a Neumann MCM 114? It sounds absolutely fantastic.
What kind of microphones are being used by Billie and Finneas in this npr tiny desk concert?  Thank you.
❤❤❤
OMG! We Need lana Del Rey on Tiny desk !!!!
this is ight
Pregunta random: cuantos dolares creen que gana el batero?
21:27 21:38 21:41
Both of them are extraordinary artists in their own right.  Together they are simply magical.
(Roughly)  00:33 The Greatest  6:45 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:57 I love you 18:00 Bird of a feather
who gets to sit there and watch besides rich white libs.
Muito lindo mesmo
สวยและดูดีมากคะ
Great vocals not been a fan since after the Wwafaswdwg album era but defo respect her vocal talent in this
I'm so in love  🫠
pro tip: do not watch this while putting on your makeup, you WILL cry it off
목소리가 너무 좋다.. 처음엔 빌리아일리쉬라는 가수에 대해서 시답지 않게 생각했었는데..
Stop interrupting songs with ads that’s scummy
My girl ❤❤❤
Crazy how peopke just forgot what better help did
Gaze upon a mitzvah from God. Shalom, from Jacova eleven Gevurah born March 11th in Bethlehem.  A lot of people hate. It's okay, Im 53 years old and counting. My nick name is Hey you.
I love the twist at the end of Birds of A Feather 🥹♥️
How has no-one mentioned the harmonies? They are fire!!!
she’s amazing!!❤
Timeless.
"I Love You" has been my morning alarm for a long time now. I love waking up to it.
Even at tiny desk I can't stand her. I absolutely believe she stole her whole style from the group 'men I trust'.
❤❤❤❤
I don't know why, but the way her brother stares at her creeps me out 😬
wonderful
This is art, plain and simple.
Ngl this is better than some of the Billie Eillish concerts I’ve watched on YouTube bc I can actually hear her rather than the crowd
HOW MANY HIT THE LIKE BUTTON BEFORE THEY  EVEN WATCHED ..  GREAT GREAT JOB  TINY GIANT 👏 👍 DESK...I ALSO HEARD THAT ODE TO KANSAS  RIFF I LOVE YOU..  # DUST IN THE WIND ...
Simply heavenly
How’d I miss this. Absolute perfection.
😴😴😴😴🥱🥱🥱
Carambolas! Isso ficou muito bom, e claro que iria ficar, que galerinha braba!!!
22:10 Whole performance and not 1 advert😢 beautiful
I LOVE Billie and would give up life to sing with her <3
Ella ❤
Such a talented young lady ❤❤❤
Do you know if this is on vinyl available? It's just superb... :)
She trusts him
The brother is the key. Love it all. The voice and the writing!🎉🎉🎉
I hope they make music together 4EVER! ❤😊 Simply AMAZING 🎉
Tiny desk concerts are my favorite way to experience a musician because it’s the most authentic experience ever and I really appreciate the authenticity of the whole experience and the dynamics and the editor don’t use fancy clips or visuals it’s just raw and beautiful and authentic and my goodness that’s real Beauty in action ❤️ thank youuu and thank youuuu
Suka bgd lgu lgu ny billie
"I'm gonna dress like a girl today"  This right there summarizes everything that's wrong with her generation
Ich verstehe den Hype um Bilie Eilish nicht. Ihr Gesang ist schnell ermüdend, der Klang ihrer Stimme unspektakulär
Billie Eilish is perfect wow
she looks like Scarlett Johansson
First of all Billy is awesome. Second of all if Phineas ever makes music on his own I'm going to be an instant fan.... Also Billy can come back him up too that would be rad.
8:20
Wow... "this is my brother" yeah we know that bc He writes all the music and songs. Idk why she keeps saying" we ". She never would have had anything without him; she's not pretty and if all you can do is sing mediocre one dimensional notes then you have to sell your soul to the music industry and take all your clothes off in front of everyone. Get abused by ppl like Diddy. She's walked the easy street to success bc he actually has an incredible amount of talent. Any way great job Fin. 🎉❤
I can't name or quote a single Eilish song but this popped up on autoplay and I knew I wasn't gonna be skipping. Her voice is so good.
6:27 👀
Phineas gazing at Billie with all the love as she sings is so so so sweet.
Phineas gazing at Billie with all the love as she sings is so so so sweet.
Is fineneas playing an orangewood ?
her voice is angelic. Ive been emotional all day and unable to release and hearing her beautiful voice broke me but also makes me feel so comforted, im now crying
Reminder that Better Help is an Israeli company that offers free services to the children killing army
hace tiempo algo no me daba escalofrios de lo bueno y emocionante. Precioso trabajo.
Ok so… she’s an incredible artist? One of the best sets I’ve heard on tiny desk
Respect
l love you so much Billie ♥️
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Picked the most boring songs in the world to open this.
Excellent
Why does the band look like they are dressed for prom?
Anyone else like 😬 during Birds of a Feather?
Somebody knows what marvellous guitar is FINNEAS playing?
Lol, girl, did they make you wear a skirt? That's a shame. I stumbled upon this on YouTube because of Billy, but I love the show! Next time, wear what we used to see you in, girl!
1Love
Words can't express how damaging and infuriating these ads are.
Great acting. 🤙💯
Who started listening to Tiny Desk concerts because of that interview the sound engineer? :D
I never listened to Billie E.; I just didn't. But as I respect tiny desk (best sound production ever) I decided to give it a try, she has a wonderful pure voice, so does guitarist. First song made me stay longer and listen on and on... Really magic.
❤❤❤
je t'aime
omg i'm boring
The Greatest was magical.. Beautifully done 👏🏻
This has been on repeat all week!! So good!
Officially a massive Billy Eilish fan after this performance 😊PLEASE DO A TRIO with you , finneas and Ren!
0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Love them. She is so young, i hope hollyweird doesnt eff this up
Those pipes!  She's so incredible. People love Tiny Desk because it's what music used to be before all the fakeness. Before autotune, before filters, before fillers. <3
Not to be THAT old lady but she looks gorgeous with all black hair. Love her so much, she never wavers. Such a good role model IMHO.
I can't watch this without tearing up, it's so top tier!
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Perfection
This tiny desk concert was so amazing she is so beautiful Oh my gosh I just wanna meet her so bad😘😘😍😍😁
I have not been able to stop listening to this set since it came out
Razón tenía Violeta Parra, porque cuando se escucha a Billie se ve el fondo de sus ojos claros, calmos después de tanto
That piano during the first song is ethereal
Wait a second
i just adore the way billie and finneas look at each other throughout the songs. truly such a caring and connected sibling duo 😭 both so amazingly talented, they’re one in a million fr
Well I didn't expect to start crying... during the first song...hit me in the feels. I never heard this song before either. Wow.
The Greatest and I Love You just made me cry and I'm not even on my period 😭🥲
❤
I would love to marry Billie and play music when we’re old
devoro
This is just incredible, thank you Tiny Desk for giving us our favorite artists in their finest form.
I've watched Greatest about 10 times now. I'll make it to the second song eventually. This is a phenomenal performance
This version of "i love you" is gold
beautiful! Also, great hair all around!
The WASP/Jews are really the best humans on earth since 2000 years... Amazing Western culture. I m asian i can tell you changed the humanity forever.
The brother can’t sing
QUE VOZ PERFEITAA!
Undeniably sensational.
I never really listened to her until I heard the Oscars song. I balled my eyes off. She has a sultry voice
Really hoped that she'd belted man am I the greatest, that gives me the chiiillsssss, would have been so great live
Wow the broods  need to do a tiny desk!!!❤
How much brighter is the world w/ these 2 in it❓️
Cade os brasileiros pra deixar a sua marca
Piano partttttt 🥹🥹🥹😭😭❤️❤️💕💕💕
Good
✨BILLIE EILLISH!!💚💙❤️______________________________________________________________________________________________
she hit evevery note the entire video. ill never unstarnd the hate. shes one of best of our generation
Pqp
her voice ugh 😤
Saudade, será que quem escreveu é Brasileiro ou português? Bela voz! Muito bom
18:30 ❤
❤
SHE IS SO PRETTY
Интересное видео, но странно, что просмотров еще так мало.. пробовали развить через ютифай?
Maybe its just the song choices but their tiny desk concert during Covid was way better.
elle a du talent il faut la signer cette petite...elle va percer c'est sûr jai le nez pour ça
8:29 Billie the woman that you areeee
I didn't know how much I appreciate her, until this channel made it happen. I've broadened my musical horizons multiple dozens of times, thanks to NPR Tiny Desk. She is a treasure.
Really envious of people that have music careers I had one but I had to give it up because it wasn't for me, it was one of the hardest things I had to do but I have faith in that fact that sacrifice has its own reward 🤲 it's funny how we pushed and pulled by forces greater than us  ❤
Lunch  L’ Amour De Ma Vie  Bittersuite
Unlike Sabrina, she can actually sing
what a great artist -  melody, lyrics, emotions, etc. First time i heard Billie was "i love you and now I'm a big fan since.
Anyone else crying? 😭
We love you Billie.. all our respect ❤
Love Billie's music, and I'm a 49 year old man.  She's got undeniable talent and a style all her own.  You never know who's going to have longevity in the music world, but I sure hope we get hear more from her at time goes on.
Her music would make anyone so vulnerable
SET LIST ~ 0:22 - "THE GREATEST" 6:43 - "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE" 11:52 - "i love you" 18:27 - "BIRDS OF A FEATHER"
Billie Eilish is making me a lesbian.
streaming while I'm drivin.. keep up TDC..
Pls don't promote better help, they are so problematic
Starting to sound like Fiona apple :):)
Вы поддерживаете американский милитаризм и вмешательство в другие страны?
awesome lol ehhh watta kinda best singer yes of coz beavis...
❤
amazing
wow.
What's the title of the first song ? 😭
Happy i live in the same space as her voice
Chills. Absolutely beautiful sound. Thank you for this.
te amo billie <3
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
what a fire band, imagine the nerves pumping and they killed it. y'all amazing. special props to Solo, what a slick player
BAM BAM BUHMMM AHHHH
What a F*! She is so beautiful. Thanks ❤
I like Billie yeah
Her vibrato while singing so softly is pretty amazing.
Please do Ariana grande !!!
Billie and her brother/band are so incredibly talented!!!
Hey Billie don't get shafted by the powers that be in the music industry, your music is precious,to us  remember what Prince told us. The wonderful Justin is looking out for you, take care Billie. Keep Safe. From Swansea our ocean eyes are looking out just for you. Come pay us a fleeting visit at Rhosilli some time.
Touched my heart that did, tks Billie tks.
I LOVE THESE SO F*CKIN MUCH
Love her so so much ❤
👏😻
Yes Finneas ❤
👏👏👏
wouldn't have thought of it, Billy, but you did it. I take my hat off to you, your BROTHER AND YOUR BAND
the way finneas looks at billie <3 <3
Billie like pixar studio character. Those huge eyes and smile of a Cheshire cat.
One of the best! Love them so much. This acoustic setting just improves on what was already amazing.  Is there a playlist for this?
The faces she makes at 8:06  scratches a part of my brain!
Premium concert.
Wauuuuw 😊 that hits me! Thank you for sharing this peace of art from the soul ❣️
❤️
Okay now I really want her and Finneas to do an acoustic album.
THIS IS THE EPITOME OF POP VOCALS!
watch a billion averts. video starts. another advert. and you wonder why we pirate music
real talent. way better than sabrina
She was struggling with those upbeat vocals a bit. I guess it’s out of her wheelhouse.
I don't listen to Billie Eilish but I guess she and her brother are not as awful as the haters would lead me to believe.
im grateful to be alive. for all the pain and sorrow, there are songs like these , that hurt, but connect.
Pity their contests are committed to NOT picking based off merit. There’s actually a lot of good white artists out there…
a voice from the heavens
Goodness…
Fab!🎉❤
My godddd is this talent
Her voice is surfing on the guitar 🎸 I love u Billie ❤
Love her
This is the best way to listen to Billie and Finneas. No screaming crowds. No backing tracks. Just the basics to let their talent carry the song. They don't need all that because they're that good.
Her persona is so cool. Love her
Okay but can someone just pass my number to the guy on keys 🎹
abe and finneas were locked IN on that birds of a feather outro
8:23 "Then you moved on immediately... BUM BUM BUM ‼️"
wish it was only billie singing, i love finneas songs but he was very bad in this video:/ lowkey ruined this experience for me
Whoever came up with tiny desk concept at NPR needs a raise stat!
É lindo ver um talento assim…
Le faltó cantar La Guadalupana
Billie Eilish’s voice is truly beautiful. Conan Gray tiny desk though???
I am still trying to understand but, I found her songs boring and nothing special. Its not bad its just nothing special in the way she sings.
in love with them!!❤
I have been listening to tiny desk since 2000. And it just keeps getting better. The coverage of artists is phenomenal. And the voices and the instruments blend into something magnificent in that tiny place.
M3T4
safe place omg billie's voices the best
the piano ... in birds of a feather .. wow
wow
Great performance and presentation. Remember folks, these artists do not have in-ear or floor monitors. They rely on their talents to use the room's acoustics to produce their art and hence, the magic and beauty of Tiny Desk. Cheers.
sooo goood
18:28
lovely! ❤
singing i love you after L’AMOUR DE MA VIE was diabolical. i love how her mind works
I fasho have a HUGE crush on her 💯💯💯
Idk as a fellow singer or what but you can tell her voice is not 100% right now, so proud and thankful she did this and worked her way around it anyway ❤
When an annoying advert starts halfway through a song it's a crime against art, humanity, etc.
great
I wish those acoustic versions were on Spotify 🥹 but please stop putting the ads in the middle of the songsssss 😭
Omg ‘all my love and pAatience’ HOW??
OPPA FINNEAS
I was wondering what is that mark on Billie's arm?
MUCH LOVE DEAR BILLIE .
The tiny desk was lovely
8:29 does something to my brain🤌🏼🤌🏼🙌
4:16
When they sang I love you it’s like you could see Finneas thinking of sweet Billie at 16 🥹
god her voice is so powerful even in a mellow song like i love you
Billie 4:13 Maan im the greatest - best vocals
i love billie irish
You guys should put chapters in the videos for the song breaks.
@BillieEilish ❤
She’s literally unreal.
They all have beautiful eyes, great band.
Billie <33 i loveee youuuuu
That voice. 🥰
I soooo wish Rosalia comes up this year! And Stormzy!
This made me fall in love with Billie
SIA PLEASE
I love that little girl. My favorite artist. I am not young and I don't think you have to be to enjoy Billie. ❤
I just want to forget about that tiny desk just to hear it for the first time again
Bro Billie is so pretty
She’s the Radiohead of the modern pop world, and I’m here for every second.
❤❤❤
I'm in tears........... So beautiful
Ima bad guy
Amazing perfonmance, but that black acoustic guitar sounds awful, almost like a toy guitar, what a shame
Obsessed with her vocals! Just stunning!!! ❤
I would love to hear Billie cover Karen Carpenter. They have the same soul. 😇
I love this vibe thanks so much tiny desk this is my fav album and ngl the drummer looks like he is using pasta 😂 good job Billie and her team thanks so much tiny desk these videos bring me joy!
Wow, fan from now on Billy
I Love you billie eilish
Anyone in 2025? 😭😍❤️‍🔥😭
Que delícia!
She is só cute
clicked 'like' first :)
Obrigado Billie álbum que eu mas escutei ano passado e pretendo continuar ouvindo em 2025
Something about her voice gives me goosebumps. Her personality is usually pretty silly, but her songs are so mournful. She's a real phenomenon - it's a pleasure live during her career.
Wow. Shivers ❤
I was not expecting this one, but i am all for it, Billie❤❤❤❤❤! Thank you, Tiny Desks❤❤❤😊😊😊
Bro that piano man is the goat,its like he was talking with the piano,specially in lamour de ma vie
I LOVE I LOVE YOU AHHHH YES
that "you waited" ughhhh
Какое владение голосом, мааать, я просто в афиге с нее 🤘
Warm like a blanket, but still gives you goosebumps ❤❤❤❤
11:53 😭😭😭
I wish she had singed wildflower
6:46 amo eso improvisado
Billie Eilish Tiny Desk made me so happy today!
Reminds ne of Glen Hansard songs
Famous people are so bad at introducing the band. She did it at least, but Christ use their full names
As someone who is over 40, I pretty much stayed away from her music as I found it to not be for me. Shes not a good singer TO ME. I find her to be a cute acapela type of singer. She can't hit the high notes and goes for the subtle soft note. The youth loves her and I can't understand why. It's true what they say I guess, music through the generations are just completely different. Ya enjoy it, I'll continue to live my life without caring for her and her music 🤷🏽‍♂️. Everyone will live a peaceful life 😆. She's pretty much the same at that Carpenter girl who enjoys shaking like she got ates in her pants lol. They both sound the same to me
Just so crisp ❤
Sitting here watching.. quiet and still… just transcending into the sublime and striking performance. Soothing and soft.. 😊
Wow😮
❤❤❤❤❤
Insane how Billie is so good my least favorite performance is her current number one song in the world.
11:52 - Eilish: I Love You.... or Arturo Sandoval: A Mis Abuelos.
this is so good my god!
she's so fascinating to watch sing, I can honestly say she's the only one that is fasinatingto watch HOW she gets those vocals. pure emotion. musics best friend. she def. is one of the most PURELY SELF MADE TALENT one can ever find. that's my opinion anyway. There's so much talent in the music world it can be hard to spot those unique once in a lifetime s shining there like she does. Glad she's recognized for her INSANE TECHNICAL TECHNIQUE TO HER VOICE. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤New respect after watching this..
Truly Amazing❤❤❤
Bueno aún no lo veo completo, Pero suena muy lindo, suenan muy bien y hermoso todos!! Suenas muy hermoso aún es acústico Billie Eilish, siempre has cantado, Maravillosa y Hermosamente!! 🌸✨🩵🎶🤍🧡🌱🎶⚡🌬️🍃
her mic WAS ONNNN. i absolutely love this and adore her and her voice.
wow she is so so good wow
she and her music are growing up. Its awesome to witness the growth of an artist
diosss q vozzz

lana del rey is missing here
falta lana del rey aqui?
Lana del rey ¿?
lana del rey ¿?
guys, I just realized that the hat that Mac Miller wore in his tiny desk performance is on the shelf behind Billie. 😢
Zzzz :(
My 3 month old baby falls asleep to this video without fail ❤️
Piano player is hot 😅
Hermoso 💚
I just love her so much ❤
She's tired 😢
Fire 🔥
Wow her singing I Love You after all this time is chilling. What a treat to listen to.
Billie, I admire you a lot, you give me a good vibe, your voice doesn't lie. It's impressive what you do. Never stop, your rite barely touches the cosmos, the gods will deliver it to you.
Te amo!
love u
🥰
If you turned the sound off...and just watched... you'd still know this was special... and wanna hear it... the music comes from inside...you can tell...   ❤️🐻
thank u for the great performance!!
Charlie out here doing concert.
the audio
18:29 song ❤
Раньше никогда её не слушала, а то что слышала случайно не цепляло. А сейчас прям удивительное открытие сделала) это было прекрасно
I love tiny desk, but that better help commercial voice at the start is such a jarring way to start a music experience, really makes me not listen to tiny desks on repeat any longer
BILLLLIEEE UGH
Love them so much:: stay real
Gifted
Я без тебя никак не могу. Я больше всех тебя люблю.
Осталось только покорить самую главную вершину и получить приз
i love you i love you ahhh, voice like an angel fr
Amazing and raw vocals! Thanks for this :)
Why is Megan Fox starting a new career??
8:39 super sharp oof
and those lip fillers make you look horrible.
Yeah I don't like Lisbon it's nasty 😂oh well 😂
Yes yes yes she is the greatest, and her brother too! Ty both of you.for sharing your talent to everyone. Much love
AAAAH! THIS IS JUST ANOTHER UNHEARD-OF BEATNEACK BAND ! ENJOY WHILE YOU CAN PRX ERS🎉🎉🎉
Love you billie😍🤍🤍
If you can make me well-up from a tiny-desk, you're doing it well.  And yes, 'saudade' kinda is all the people I loved who are not here anymore.
I want to marry her. I wish I could meet her in 2025. We were meant to be together.
Hearing the greatest live sounds like a lullaby. Like a mother singing a baby to sleep. Intentional? Given the meaning of the song? Interesting if so 😊
Abe on keys is respectfully and fully killing it. S/o to Billie and Finneas man!
wow.
18:31 birds of feather
Gracias Maria Paula por hacerme sufrir todas estas canciones jajajaja 👍🏻
such pure vocals.... amazing
have you thought about bringing evanescence to tiny desk concerts? it would be nice, please :3
16:10 no words for how beautiful this part is
Pak Josh & Pak Niel kalian keren
She's amazing
最近、ビリーアイリッシュとっても大好きになり、よく聴いております🎉滲みますよね❣️
Okay but i wish there was a song of these instruments and her just doing the hmmms and oos for background music for studying ❤
cried to this
Her voice is hauntingly beautiful 🖤
Oh Billie how I love you
As long as I live, I will never understand what people see in "Birds of a Feather" and why that one was put forward for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the upcoming Grammys. For me, it's a classic example of a song that starts out sounding interesting but then rapidly outstays its welcome. As a single, "Lunch" was SO much better! And of all the songs on the album, "The Greatest" is the true standout. It's next-level superb!
Fantastic!!
Que bonito es escuchar estas voces llenan el.alma ❤
This is amazing but the ads in the middle of the songs are terribly annoying!
I love how Billie almost always closes her eyes and moves her hands and fingers very intimately, just as the music happens through her body. It makes me understand how she IS the music and I don't wanna assume or suggest anything, but as someone in the spectrum who does this type of things with music and other little passions, I feel so related to the feeling. <3
Her voice is so heartbreakingly beautiful I will never have my breath around her I stg
Thank god this woman chose to do music and not something else
TEANMO
que hermoso canta...y sus melodías traspasan el alma
It's quite a big desk
I love Billie so much...she is the greatest! So much talent in her little bittie fingers and Finneas is a genius.
its a note of a real artiest when they mention everyone by name excepted yourself
I LOVE YOU SO SMUCH BILLIE KEEP GOING❤❤❤❤
These tiny desk concerts are amazing! Thank you NPR! I SAW Taylor Swifts a few months ago! Bravo 👏🏆👍Lydia 🎉
as a portuguese speaker, i really felt what the description means.
Became a fan of hers this year I’m 10 years older. But wow !! She’s a powerhouse love Billie
❤❤❤
I'm a 46 year old singer/song writer. This is like a sound from heaven.
ate
You don’t need makeup
if only these versions of the songs were on spotify...
너무 좋다....
3:26 is wife worthy id be willing to get a family going.
Billie's Vocal in these environment makes me listen more than concert and on spotify...well, just in my opinion. 😅
Pas amateur du tout !!
He's  bad news
I'm 70 and like others of my generation, we all believed that music of our era was the best. And then along comes Billie Eilish.  I can't believe she's only 23 and has accomplished so much quality music already!  We are all lucky to have an artist like Billie come around in our lifetime.  She's simply fabulous!
So beautiful  ..
Impecable
You know what? Let's this one be the first video I see this 2025.
Awesome Band 😊 Singing And Music 🎼 ❤
Very Beautiful ❤ Awesome 😎 Thank You 🙏 😊
Absolutely beautiful. Very well done for being so nervous. It was splendid!
I just skimmed through the comments and somebody was shitting on Billie for being garbage and said NewJeans makes the best music🤣 yo you people should be comedians
The greatest and I love you sounds like they could be Coldplay songs and I love that so much 🥹😮‍💨😭
ive always love i love you what an amazing performance of it <3
“ I didn’t mean to make you cry” girl I’ve been bawling my eyes  out before you started to sing it 😂
She was having bad anxiety poor Billie 😌
so much talent behind that desk lol
Billie Eilish is mesmerizing. I find myself holding my breath listening to her sing because I don't want to miss a single note. Just lovely - a once in a lifetime artist.
I loved her latest album so it was a delight to see this on my feed!
All I can say is Billie Eilish ⭐🤩🤟
Que talento tan grande tiene billie! A mi gusto el hermano con su coro arruina la canción más hermosa donde ella brilla sola
i just dont words in this moment
Her voice give me chills and tears, so beautiful.
Birds of a feather is fab. These talented cats seem delightful. Also, I saw how piano was looking at Billie ooooh.
One of the most moving TDConcerts ever. 🥲
Omg incredible.
She sounds a lot like Feist here
I am so in love with her ❤
Love how people support a racist like her saying the C word with no remorse
I<3Billie
this brown is nice for her, better than the black or that blonde.
yesss girl give us nothing!!!
i wasnt expecting to cry....
Наконец-то я понял тебя. Ты хорошая девчонка! И прекрасная певица!
Why and how does she have the most perfect and beautiful voice, and the two of them make the perfect duo. How? So gorgeous, great for work listening!
Goatty
i love you is one of my favorite songs so it’s sweet to see them perform this still ❤
The emotions that come through are so beautiful
She sings while she sleeps or other way round , gorgeous voice, all the calmness sweetness magic she creates, bro with a guitar band and tiny desk create good vibes!
Tvoj brat je kráľ. 🎸🎸🎸😀😀😀 Škoda, že nemáte môj klavír. Je to unikát. A tým ako hrá by z neho dostal všetko....
She was not going to dress like a an auntie stud in front of actual black people😂😂
Wow this is so beautiful
8:29 gave me chills
18:00 my favourite
She is such a pure soul, it’s refreshing
✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️
WOW ❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
Okay, if anyone is still doubting her talent after this, they're out of their minds.
Why does this feel like if billie was an indie artist all of the sudden, i love it
That ‘ Bum Bum Bum ’ has done something to me 😭🙏🙏
Her voice is incredible!
Billi is a vibe...2nd best tiny desk behind mac!!!!!
Billie is one of the few female artists that seems completely unaffected by the Taylor Swift phenomenon. Not even trying to compete. Just being herself. Being unique.
She’s a blonde right? She should fly that flag proud. I love everything about her
A friend  of mine put me on to her, and i never listened to this style  of music, but  Billie Eillish is someone special.  When i listen  to her sing, she puts me into such a chill state of mind. 🔥
18:10 ❤
This version of THE GREATEST is so much sadder but so beautiful
19:49 favorite
Listening over and over❤🥰☺️
this kid is on glee
Something different. Could it be Christ?
00:20 The Greatest 06:43 L’Amour De Ma Vie 11:52 I Love You 18:26 Birds Of A Feather
She is so cute ♥ Thanks NPR ☺
Rock On Billie ❤

Hermosas voces que empastan genial, me encantan, piel de gallina de escucharlos increibles!!!
Wildflower😭😭😭😭
BILLIEEEEEE <3
😍❤‍🩹Its  a band aid for  the  soul  and heart...
Maravilhosa!
Bro.  Just play play the guitar.
i loved every second of this omg
Que linda se ve Billie Eilish con su uniforme de colegiala. Estos Tiny Desk Concert de NPR Music evocan un aire a los Deaconectados de MTV. Like si vistes la bandera de Colombia
A primeira musica é muito bonita.
My precious beautiful angel 🧸🤍
Some of the blandest music ever to geace this studio.
God u can really hear the difference from the old I love u to now. It’s crazy
absolutely gorgeous. i just think it's hilarious that she laughed in the middle of 'I Love You'
Thanks god for this tiny desk i fckn love you billie & finneas❤❤
I hope billie and finneas see these comments and realize how amazing an acoustic album would be(as if they dont already know)
I hope billie and finneas see these comments and realize how amazing an acoustic album would be(as if they dont already know)
Imagine her not having Finneas … It would most likely be Billie Eilish Who ?
3:45 I can't she's so so good
❤❤❤
15:15 Respect to the sand bag player
Why was she neevous?
This is the most beautiful thing ive ever heard. ❤
What’s the name of the first song ?❤️
this is the first time i've liked Billie, Birds of the feather - magical voice. Finally a good pop song :)
Catriel y paco les ganan :3
The way she say " i love you" at the end of her third song its the most beautyfull way i ve never heard
The beginning verse of first song spoke to me as a mum to child that hasn’t slept in two years lol
🤍
👍
I forgot how incredible her voice is, and their bond is sweet to see. Their parents were so good with the way they raised them and look what we get from that.
her voice & music style is just on a whole different level ❤
Now Finneas needs his own tiny desk concert!!  He did a great paste studio one yrs ago, but I would love to hear some of his newer songs live/stripped back (or other versions) on this platform
mid
I feel like billy and x would be best friends I can see x in this
you know what's crazy she's literally a normal person just like us.
Tiny desk is raw and hits a part of the soul! I love it.
This is the serotonin I needed
🥴time tells all I guess
I'm mesmerized...
i love you billie, and PLEASE INVITE JUNGLE
God her voice is literally stunning words can't describe how soothing it feels to listen
Didn't want this to end... so so good my godd😮‍💨😩 we need an acoustic album from Billie asap!!🎤🎸
🤩🤩🤩
Que voz, ta dodo....
This girl is 🔥
i want to see billie and finneas split now and see how they change music wise
😍😍✨
Thanks for the memories of the experiences one might find out about life and what you love to do stay safe take care have a great life
Tan linda
Her voice... she sounds so mature.
NPR its actually billie eilish and finneas...dafaq, Ya'll really underappreciate Finneas
Just perfect ❣
💞💞💞💞💞
OMG SHE DID I LOVE YOU!!! That was my favorite song for sooooo long
Talent

FRISSONS
TIMESTAMPS 0:00 the greatest 5:56 talking 6:42 l'amour de ma vie 10:16 talking 11:52 i love you 16:49 talking + intro to band 18:25 birds of a feather
In my life, I have never seen so much feeling in a person while singing 🖤
literally sobbed the entire time. I actually delayed watching this because I knew I couldn't take it. THE GREATEST was heart wrenching. touches my soul everytime. I could just imagine the billie a few years ago, dealing with so much, and seeing her now. she has grown into something beautiful. she deserves the world and more. i love her sm. can't describe.
What a voice!!! What a presence, and her songs carry soooo much pain and growth, I simply love it, feel every word she is singing to my core
I'm starting to need longer concerts of Tiny Desk, 1-hour long maybe? 🥺
TINY DESK!!!!!!
20 ads in 20 minutes on good music is actually nasty work
15:14 I start crying. Finnea and Billie are two beautiful spirits. Thank you universe.
Was way overdue
Mid
she has a beautiful voice 😮‍💨
Why is her brother always there?? What kind of a relationship do they have 😅
honestly the loml and my spouse agrees
The thing about Billie I admire is I’ve never not seen her give it her all. Her voice may be soft but she’s always giving so much strength.
Canta mejor
18:25 la canción dedicada mi gato. Descanse en paz.🤍
BUM BUM BUM
please do gracie abrams
I love Billie so much, she sings from the heart
She simply sings my current favorite and then my favorite ever!
I can't stop watching and listening to this one.
Please invite Bruno Mars, it would be amazing ❤
say no to betterhelp NPR
Hey main stream Music seems so fake. This sound is the most beautiful, soulful vulnerable voice that I I just live for! Your an angel Girl ❤❤
Wow 😮❤
I'm speechless.... phenomenal ❤
Beautiful
im proud of you from nganjuk❤❤❤
Absolute talent, if your eyes were open it would be even better. Jmo
One of my Fave artist
The most angelic voice in the universe ❤
Never heard of this Billie Eilish band, but they are really something else! Bravo Billie Eilish, bravo!!! <3
This guitar is ou of tune. Billie wonderful!!
Love that she played "I love you" one of my all time faves <3
So good. Thanks Billie and Finneas for your music.
I adore Billie and Finneas with my whole heart. This was absolutely beautiful!! Birds of a feather is my favourite song in the world 💜
increibleee
this was pretty boring.
mew mew mew mew, mew mew mew mew mew
So fresh :D
man 3 minitues in and i am crying like a baby , The feeling is so real. We love you both ♥
6:44 I absolutely love this version of this song sooooo much this timestamp is mostly for me hahahah
Am i going crazy or was this reuploaded? I remember the mixing to be different, her voice was all muffled, but everything is so crisp now thank you tiny desk
Sooooo gooood!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Magnificent!
eu só vejo as ANAVITORIA fazendo isso, chamem agoraaaaa!! ❤
This might be the only NPR I’ve seen where you don’t hear all the percussion. Wondering if this was a choice or to do with how quiet everything is.
POV: Billie Eilish sang on your birthday celebration in your room:
Not a hater but her voice is average / decent , nothing special
Incredible
I absolutely Love this …..her voice is so calming to listen to
All thanks to Bill Nye. His shoutout in Kai Cenats stream. That's my reason for loving this song even more than I already did.
Wow 🥹❤️
Man she's so insanely good. Deserves all the love and praise she's getting.
06:44
bily ben ami ciudad te pago
I'm 50, the more I hear of Billie (& Finneas) the more I like them!  There's just a grounded realness mixed with a musical-theatre essence to their work. I always find myself asking how is this young artist so different, so good?
Second song accurately depicts nature of women’s hearts
very lovely...too bad she hitched her wagon to the progtards
sorry but she's boring. just can't get into the music
Hmmmm
7
I thought we all understood better help is problematic and so is taking money from them for ad space. NPR should really be more than aware by now. Sort of disappointing.
Angelic 🕊️
8:19
Dios que hermoso, cuantas ganas tengo de escucharla en vivo con el mismo microfono de condensador que usa aca
PLS BILLIE DESERVES ALBUM OF THE YEAR😭😭😭
I LOVE BILLI EILISH FOR OVER HER
i see you, person that wrote the heartfull video description, i see you.  that was touching.
im over here a 23 year old guy first time hearing these songs and honestly this just brought me to tears
Amazing
This is so f*cking good it makes me cry. It's a different level to other artists.
Love NPR love tiny desk but they gotta drop better health.
Top respect 🎙🔊✨️🎶🔥🔥🔥🔝👍🏼
Billie Eilish is actually reincarnated Kurt Cobain in a female version.
one for Finneas alone, pleeeeeease!!!!!!!
High level concert.
I think she really got a beautiful voice i feel calm after listening to her sing 🧘🏽‍♂️
יצאה מבני ברק
Wow she’s actually looking normal these days!
Love her
Sorry too made up for me. Sorry AND sorry. This was too made up.
Porque el video dura solo 3 segundos
This kinda Makes me cry 😢 a lot.
tiny desk
And shout out to everyone else working in this performance. The other members of the band and the sound engineers and folks behind the scenes to set this up. AMAZING.
boring af yo
dont end taylor midswift like this billie
oh man, Tiny desk scores yet another hit and Billie Eilish has become a fine young woman with talent that abounds. Good on her. I hope the kid stays real all her life. This is class, it really is.
thank you to the person who wrote the description, it's beautiful
Can they not clap so loud between songs
erorr again mental meh
Te amo Billie 🩵 tu música me salvo este año!!! Este disco me acompaño mucho ..senti que te habías metido en mis pensamientos 😢
Anglic voice ❤so special talent 😊
billie in long straight hair again lkgjhgojfoiwawhowfjowh

❤❤❤❤❤❤
“The Greatest!”  Combination ❤
18:13 11:50
crazy they did i love you, that riff is haunting
please get clairo on here !!
I need this version on my playlist! Her voice sound like I swim in the clouds. So, freaking talent.
te amo
Merry Christmas to all of you out there!  I've never been a fan until recently. As Billie has matured, so has her music. Hearing this more softer side with no auto tune or editing really let's her talent shine. She's really grown into a beautiful young woman. It resonates with me as my own daughter has grown and matured. I look forward to watching this journey.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
It is so evident in this how she has continued to grow better and better as a vocalist, such great control 😮‍💨
남자목소리좀 없애주실분
Birds of a feather, and I love you always make me bawl like a baby they’re so good
Billie's soft vibrato soothes like pepto
Her voice is beautiful
The man behind tiny desk is a sound engineer genius
Okay, so there's a lot of hype around Billie Eilish these days. This live performance by her and her band explains it all.
She 🔥
im in love with her
Holy s*** you guys don't edit this before you release it this is not supposed to be released this is garbage
I mean so far the first 3 minutes this tiny desk is trash you are putting me to sleep 100
This was insanely good.
How lucky is that crowd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone from 2024 here????

Thank you for your clear voice 🥹💘
Finneas voice is soo beautiful, compliments billie's perfectly
Great stuff!  Such a nice job by all involved.  Brother Finneas is so good.  I hope he gets more recognition than "the other guy in Wham."
Dr drew is a dousche nozzle
Simply the best
she's so pretty and he's so charming
Never really bothered to really listen to Billie, from what i had seen of her it was apparent she was a pretty cool  person, im impressed
Wow
Love me some Billie!!!  Her music is so serene!!!
16:05 the delicate runs :’)
the most beautiful voice LOVE YOU BILLIE!!! 🤍🤍🤍

Beautiful set!! Always impressed with how well the artist's raw talent and vocals shine during a Tiny Desk Concert. Can't wait for Wallows to have a tiny concert too!
Billie's voice sound better than ever !
Ahhh Billie…. You’re so unique  ❤
So obsessed with these tiny desk videos huhu ngl ngl

The peaceful sound of an angel
Hey she’s not dressed like a caricature of a black man and acting like what she thinks they do in this one, that’s different!
birds of a feather❤ love so mush! it is amazing
To whoever is listening to this song now, wherever you are.... Sending you love, peace, healing and all good wishes. May your life be good❤
I've come back so many times to this tiny desk. I love Billie sm she never disappoints! I specially love this ´the greatest´ rendition. I wish she did wildflower too and I wish I had this concert on stream to listen all the time. Loving how so many people are finally waking up to her voice and talent, wbk since 2019 when I first listened to when the party's over for the first time.
Cant wait for her to start an onlyfans

Finneas lookin' like the son of Sting!
True artists! ... and Tiny Desk is a big dusting job!
There are no words...Billie has the voice of an angel

It's such a blessing and a curse that my country got no ads on YT
She sounds better live then recoded 😅❤

You made tiny huge...
Absolute Dominance
She's toooooooo prettyyyyyy
She's amazing. Her voice brings me to tears ❤️
Thumbs up for sound engineering.  😊  they are the best!
Can the annoying baby boomers who say there's no good music anymore listen to this
Omg i just love her, both are so talented. Love it, the best Tiny Desk ever
The last song I'm 73 This song made me Cry And i'm not ashamed Her voice The melodie My GOD crying😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤

Brother and sister are so talented
Yea Tiny Desk is where the line between Good and Great is drawn.
Thank you. It was beautiful.❤🙏
why is this video 80 hours long?
You're so pretty Billie🥰
Omg no way
Woah….just pure and deep Billie. Perfect listening for Christmas Eve. Tiny Desk is the perfect place! ❤
Never heard of her until now.
Billie is just so so so so talented. I love when she does acoustic version of her songs. Crazy good!
A commercial in the middle of birds of a feather is crazy
Betterhelp as a sponsor, really?
Billie that wasn’t your debut album— I’ve been here since bellyache
Wow she is soo good naturally. Now I know for sure she doesn’t use any autotune
great , i loved ❤🧡
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
No se si soy yo pero los paneos de este Tiy estan raros, guitarra super paneada a la derecha la voz no esta al centro de hecho muy a la izquiera. Ta sharoooooooooo
Talent speaks for itself, bravissima!
❤❤❤❤  best vibe
I'm in my mid 30s and this girl brings me to tears every time I hear her sing. She truly came here with a purpose ❤
Her voice is -always- so consuming in the best way possible. Otherworldy.
But im still a big fan
Y is dressing like a girl weird aren't you a girl
Who hurt this woman!? 😡
tiny desk. enormous artists.
he just looks so proud of her i absolutely love it
I just want you all to know that @betterhelp is unaffordable. They won’t help you! It’s a scam!
6:40 here’s what you looking for
Hey Billie😍✨️🤛😂🫶🫶🫶🫶
she looks like michael jackson
From guests such as David Russell to Jason Vieaux, we finally arrive at this... sad times.
Looveee itt ❤
Billie has an incredible voice, it never fails to amaze me!
SZA NEXT PLSSSS
Her voice is something special, the control, tone, soul, she’s really in her own lane
Did she do a tiny desk before? When she had green hair? Love her voice
Que mi dios me la bendiga, canta muy bonito
I see Aurora in her now ❤
I got into the Billie rabbit hole this year the moment I decided to listen to Hit Me Hard And Soft. As someone whose talent test is a Tiny Desk performance, I'm so glad they did this! So in awe!! I'm not sure if I'm ready to listen to her older releases yet because IDK if I can handle it...
Hitting the groove right all the while melodic harmony with lite intonations of stretching the rhymes while keeping the rhythm yes you do
listening to billie is like listening to a dying cat
Billie's voice is so amazing.
Is there her first time on Tiny Desk?  I always thought she had been on before.
Sounds exactly like her album. Absolutely stunning
inject this into my veins please
las extraño :/
🖤🖤
malísimo, para esto pago u tub?
Her control and use of her instrument is truly mesmerizing.
4:14 I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE SO DREAMY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 NOW IM SLEEPING
The way Finneas looks at Billie 🥹
it’s too short 😢
He doesn’t sing like that but when she starts to “feel” he joins in to keep her balanced. 🍀
He’s her coping mechanism in life. Comfortability. 🍀
the band killed it- love the ties
It's amazing that they both so young
I love billie but, why is tiny desk collaborating with better help? Known for terrible business practices and therapy?
And thats it? This is the HYPE? OK!
No me transmite nada , no se
EL HERMANO SE LLEVO TODO EL TALENTO Y LA BELLEZA, LA OTRA SOLO ES GUAPA Y PEDORRA
🖤🖤🖤🖤
TINY DESK NEEDS GALDIVE TO SHOW
Marvellous, just marvellous
The zoom in and see the collar running the whole outfit adding the perfect contrast with her eyes. I could cry. 🍀
They better cut them a check 😭500k likes is crazy
♥
Nobody else notice the way Finneas looks at her? SIBLING GOALS, he looks so proud.
Im just here for finneas
9:30
8:30 pfff… that ‘bum bum bum’ hits hard!
Madeline. I love you so much and i will forever love you. This reminds me of you. and will always remind me of you. I love you so much and i can't wait to see you again my beautiful queen. Your lover. Hamza.
The person who wrote the video description❤
😢😢
birds of a feather is the song that gives me light. thank you billie for sharing this to the world!! ⋆｡˚ ☁︎ ˚｡⋆｡˚ ☀︎⋆.ೃ࿔*:･ ˚｡⋆
she makes it look effortless which makes it so fascinating. she's brilliant.
quiero que dure 2hs
Que increible que sos por diossssssssssssssssssssssssss, nunca dejes de cantar mujer.
her eyebrows explain many things
she cant really sing but give her 6 for effort
One of the best parts about Billie is she can make her live settings like this sound like the original with no autotune , which is rare and deserves to be acknowledged for her and all others who can do it !
This set made me think of The Civil Wars. This is the type of music that really sinks deep <3
the way she genuinely does not need even an ounce of auto tune or ANYTHING. Her vocals have always been one of the most impressive things ever, its actually insane- pureeeee talent
It went number one cause it has a good beat and you weren’t whispering the whole time. You have a beautiful voice but for me I can’t listen to whispering. 😔
❤
Can we start boycotting artists? I'm tired of people caring more about famous people than politics.
billie is the only artist that can make me cry every time
great job capturing and mixing finneas voice in.
i love you just hits different
Love her and as a Brazilian this description of the video just got me Oh gosh ...especially at this time of the year, saudade is a constant feeling now.
Billie eilish is one of the few singers that doesn’t need auto tune to be good at singing.
this is therapeutic
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation And school comes along just to end it So the annual problem for our generation Is finding a good way to spend it Like maybe Building a rocket or fighting a mummy Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey!) Or giving a monkey a shower Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!) Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)
Billie always reaches into the depths of my spirit and finds the unhealed parts of me and forces me to face them. That said, it's 9:30 am and I'm weeping in my bed once again..  because I thought I could ignore my problems but I can't. Thank you Billie. No one can break me like this 💔
Does this confirm that Billie as a feat on KSI’s Dirty. Her outfit is pretty similar to the “girl’s” in the visualizer
I died, my wife has an angelic voice!!
Balik kerja dengerin ini sambil rebahan, syurga sekaliiiiw
サムネPDRさんの部屋かと思った
Wouahhhhh❤👏👏👏👏👏
Can someone pls tell what guitar was Finneas using during the first song
Such beautiful restraint on such heavy material.
So incredible   the greatest everr
Why when she tries to sing any type of slow song you can barely understand what she is saying it's like she is trying to be super quiet and whisper
I’m depressed… AND EVERY TIME BILLIE TALKS ABOUT BEING NERVOUS, WAKING UP AT 1pm AND APOLOGIZING FOR HER VOICE/ANYTHING ELSE…… I RELATE SO MUCH!!! She’s been on tour, took time out of her schedule to do this (probably because she had to. 😢) and came to Tony desk and gave us a beautiful performance!!! I cried so much! I hate when I have to show up and be there. SO THE FACT THAT SHE DID THE VIDEO IS BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING AND LOVELY! I can RELATE with her so much and I’m crying. I LOVE YOU BILLIE!!!! THANK YOU FOR THIS GORGEOUS ALBUM YOU MADE! IT’S HELPED ME SO MUCH!!!! HIT ME HARD AND SOFT SO ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF YOURS!!!! 😭😭😭😭💙🩵💙🩵💙🩵💙🩵🥺😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😭😭😭🥺😭😭🌈🥰🥰🥰💙💙💙
just impossible say if she is more beautiful or talented...
อย่างไรก็ได้จ้ะ
Beautiful to see, beautiful to listen to, but the thing is, it is very beautiful to feel. Billie Eilish is absolutely the greatest.
18:28 First time hearing 'Birds of a feather' 🔥❤️
aww but why'd they smiled so randomly together at 15:22
I love this woman.
Billie would sound so beautiful singing Christian music & praising the Lord 😍💕🙇‍♀️🤍
can't she sing without Finneas?
OMG she's SOOOOOOOOO freaking amazinggggg!!! I love her so much
❤❤so Amazing ❤️ Billie you are sooo Amazing ❤️ Love you 💕 your Voice🫶❤️
ไพเราะมากๆ ขอบคุณมากๆค่ะ
Kudos to Tiny Desk concerts. Been a fan forever, and introduced to so much music I never would have ever heard.  Remember,  they are funded by  little public funds and a lot of donations .  If you're feeling flush, maybe consider donating.
We need Lana Del Rey in here next pleaseeee 😭😭😩😩😩😩
I like her a lot more now.
she is truly an artist of such unmatched talent. thank you for this amazing performance. i loved to see songs that tend to be less popular or less played live. gave a spotlight to some of my favourites from hers.
Just perfect.
Merinding
He control is amazing! Almost sounds effortless. This duo of finneas and Billie… breathtaking!!!
I love billie ❤
Is the real music!!! Original
randoms get tiny desk but lana will never
Portugal mentioned SIUUUUUU
She sounds exactly the same, stunning voice!
God her voice is  sossososososooaoaoaoao mesmerizing
Blessed my ears ❤❤
We love you Tiny Desk Concert.
The power of her music is in the control she has over her voice. Flawless and effortless.
🥰
I like her black hair ....
Ozempic really works huh?
Perfection 💚
When she get so skinny did I miss something ? lol I mean she still looks great
Billie your voice is so pure and natural keep it booming
The Greatest sounds so vibey at 2X speed
5:31 😮🥹😭😭
This is magical.
Still taking better help sponsorships 😬
I really cried, Billie's voice is so beautiful that it touches my soul. 💗
hmm. i guess production is pretty important.
Fado
Best part 8:29
The brown queen and the yellow king?  Chess  About dream Billie, it was m
These are all so incredible! Please get blossoms on, they would be amazing ❤
The keys sound so freaking good here.
I'm a fan of Billie and love their songs including the new ones but I found her performance a bit poor on this one which is ok, you don't have to be perfect all the time as a performer.
Dig this song.
Better help..
why would she play i love you here but not on tour it’s one of my favs 😭😭😭😭😭
Dear stranger.... You have a great taste in music..... See you again after 20 yrs.
That was very good!
Every time I don’t like am artist I watch them at a tiny desk and then I change my mind, realising that what I don’t like is their rubbish ultra processed arrangements.
Crying actual tears
❤❤👏👏👏👏👏 the Best
I will never get over how perfect her voice is.
Her voice is so amazing, I loveeee!
The name of this is work of art.
STOP WITH THE AD’s IN THE MIDDLE OF SONGS
Well done for ruining it with ads tiny desk 👍
All my respect for bil and finneas, they capture every song so beautifully
l love u juninho play
Girl you were already on Tiny Desk 4 years ago. I remember it clearly
She is so beautiful and talented ❤
I love the way Finneas looks at her 🥰🖤
Finneas, da próxima fica de boca fechada fazendo o favor
Love it when 'Binneas' harmonize together, it fills my cup 🍵
Anyone else think that the description should say Finneas: guitar/vocals
4:00
When she started to count down a song like Gretchen parlato setting the tempo and vibe, I knew Billie’s a musical beauty apart from physical
Who’s here in Dec 2024?
but she can actually sing
I'll come back here often as my daily ears blessing.
mac miller vibes when shes just chatting to the people
Muy talentoso los dos
Que linda voz 😍
a billie não emprega um calvo na banda
🤪😍
Love it ❤
I see the show 'The office' inspired set up
Ya had me at the Greatest❤
Oh my!
Magic ✨
This was her best performance of i love you. I cry everytime i listen to it.
I love you sounds like "Hallelujah"
I really want YUNA to get on this so bad!
This music is so healing. Grateful to have this on a day of recovery and reflection.
I recently gave up drugs and smoking and music is just way better.
Enough to even make a grown man cry
Billie Eilish is one of the very few artists I've ever heard in my life who gives me chills with their voice. We are so lucky to have her artistry
Never thought she's so good... And now I'm a fan
'I love you' is best one
Nothing makes me cringe more than BetterHelp
this healed me
Kok ga ada wildflower😢
Why do I still think about you? F❤
Chills
You guys can't do that without me, that's unfair 😥
chihiro ??? :(((((((((((((((((((((
AMOOOOO ❤
@Orangewoodguitars getting a huge advertisement here!
omg billie’s raw vocals are no jokes❤️‍🔥
I wish Twenty One Pilots turn will come.
She just makes me happy ♥️♥️
This is audibly the LOUDEST tiny desk applause I’ve ever heard. Phenomenal.
Tiny desk what are you doing to us !! I'm dying, it's so freaking good
@billieellish,thank you! You're beautiful!
You might not want to work with betterhelp though … quite shady.
Thanks Tiny Desk — again — for showcasing sUch F I N E 👌🏼 talent that we can hear eVery single detail   Thanks Billie & Finneas for Being Real & for coLLaborating with sUch eXceptional musicians   It takes aLot of taLent to pare back such expressions & it still retain its eqwiziteness  🤩🌟🤩
18:30
She looks beautiful here!
>9M in 9 days is crazyyyyyyy
This is my 4th time watching  Not my last! good grief 😅

what a great artist!
Forever a billie stan 💜
She sounds so good
what was i made for > her album
Just lovely ❤❤
This is one of tiny desk’s bests for sure. Few vocal performances are truly awe-inspiring, but this one gave me chills again and again. What an incredible duo!
oh... queen of vocals
진짜 음색 개미쳤네
Chato pra crl
Those well dressed curly haired dudes are killing it too
2 Broke Girls concert.  lol.
Lia Kali
TIMESTAMPS 0:00 the greatest 5:56 talking 6:42 l'amour de ma vie 10:16 talking 11:52 i love you 16:49 talking + intro to band 18:25 birds of a feather
❤
3 minutes in and im sobbing i just love her so much
I'm not sure I've ever clicked on a thing so fast.
Nothing more rude than  interupting a musical performance with an ad.
Wow she really does have a beautiful voice. Reminds me of old timey singers of the 40s. Her brother compliments her exquisite ly.
Having to be just like heyy 🧍‍♂️ after preforming the greatest!! I would die
OMG HER VOICE IS FREAKING BEAUTIFUL
Are you Illuminati devil worshipper. You was named
Not one of my songs sung, ok.
I wish she did the barbie song too!
❤❤❤❤ this! Gave me goosebumps!
Non of musics played i know
The amount of talent oozing out of this young girl is insane.
Never ran so quick to click on a video in my life.... well maybe  only the billie Vogue video before this one 😂😂
Tenía 1 bala solamente si no me pegaba 2 tiros en los huevos. Q porquería hermano
this girl knows that we needed the i love you version
bring finneas back with for crying out loudddddd
Freaking perfection
lana del rey no tiny desk
That bassist! He doesn't use a pick to play! I love the sound of bass played with fingers!
This should be a hour long, marvelous!
Travis scott??
I love that her album music sounds just like her live music. It’s crazy how some artists have so much unnecessary autotune to their voice then when they sound live they sound so much better. I’m glad we get that even for us to can’t often she her sing live. There is just something about live sound and music.❤️
My favourite song from Billie 11:53 to 16:48. The melody is so beautiful
12:07
Beautiful Old School Style ❤❤❤❤❤
18:10
someone explain to me why lana never made a tyne desk??????
DO NADA KAKAKAKA
The note change in "I love you" hurts and heals my soul at the same time 🥲
It sounds exactly how she does on the recording 🤯🤯
I’m a semi-retired (who am I kidding, I only take work that allows me to be close to home, which is rare) musician that builds things now. I usually take my time to listen to supposed prodigy musicians. I will wait a few albums. Well, today, I finally listened to Billie Eilish. JUST WOW!!🤯☺️❤️ This is generational talent quite honestly.
The studio techs do a fabulous job of mixing all this---nobody ever mentions them but they make the whole thing WORK!  She is so so special.
Billie and Jason Mraz collaboration will be awesome
How can someone be so beautiful and angelic 🥺 What a special girl 🤍
❤❤❤
You're amazing Billie, so gorgeous and special.. such a cool looking personality and heart-warming voice.. This show was amazing girl, I wish I could hug you *
Bro! I love her. She shines in acoustic more.
Love Billie, but at this point she shouldn't be talking in singular. It's been a beautiful siblings story ❤️
the fisrt song is a cpy of i give you blue for alan stone sorry madame
That was astonishing. Really love the casual band vibe. Like a local band from anyone’s hometown.
Its like a sister singing for a brother!
please bring radio companyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I love Billy's Eyelash ♥️
Such a huge talent.
PURE talent . . . this doesn't happen very often and to this degree :-). Thank you SO much NPR Music for brining the firmament so CLOSE to us ! ! !
Billie’s voice is the dream seriously  love this smmm❤❤❤
Whenever I hear a great song, I typically close my eyes to truly feel the music. But BE's eyes and facial expressions are such a gift unto themselves. I can't; I don't want to miss a thing.
How come she ain’t pull up in 2000’s monkey costume?? Were there alr too many in the room?? I only see the one
Wow
I love youuuuu Billie and Finneas
diciembre brilla mas despues de esto igual que sus ojos, espero que haya tenido un bello cumpleaños y comido mucho pastel . 4ever<3
i get so emotional, i love them sm!!!
Overrated garbage. She cannot sing.
Fitnneas is an incredible writer. Writes his own and her music. Content for days. Incledible duo
I wish this was longerrr. Loved every moment of this performance. Her great control of her voice, the harmonies with Finneas, the instrument players, especially that piano guy.
Love this artist. But the musicians are so woke that is shocking to see
❤❤❤❤
Just great
I just love them endlessly and her voice is just insane. She has the most beautiful voice to me. 🥹🤍
Hey youtube, do the artists a favor and dont delete every single negative comment about them. You do nothing but make them believe they are special and do nothing wrong. Please allow free speech again.
wait isn't there is some issue ? like they were together she was 16 and him 21 ?
Thank you ❤
I loved watching tiny desk, Billie's vocals were so good and the emotions her voice hold was so pure phinneas is great guy and the band did so great job really thankyou for making my day ❤
whoever is writing tiny desk synopsis in the bio has a stunning love for words because that was beautiful to read.
Her voice is not something I would really listen too as much. Honestly, I feel like anybody can sing like that. I am wondering to myself: How was she able to get signed to a record label? Probably because the songs are written really well by her and her brother; but she is not delivering the songs vocally to the best of her ability as a singer.
Both sing with their eyes closed❤
tiny desk concerts always remind me how much i love music
watching this high is an unearthly experience
when se sings her nosestrills open up so wide that I can see everything happening in her nose and its annoys me
Billie Eilish with that girl outfit she says is stunning.
Finneas is so underappreciated it's insane, just an excellent vocalist, musician and song writer.
Omg thank you for this
Lip surgery...too bad
no way they got the same guy on piano and drums
sounding exactly the same on live and album is so diabolic but it's such a billie and finneas kinda thing so i'm not so surprised😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
f
Crazy how beautiful the lyrics of every song has been! Literally read it to yourself like two times! Infecting
Imagine Billie and Finneas mom not realizing she birth not one but two musical prodigies? Crazy 🤯🤪
respecto for everyone who’s done tiny desk
I love when you can hear Finneas' harmonies, their voices sound heavenly together
🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🌈🌼🌸💮🏵🌺🌻🌼🌷❤🧡💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
Wow❤❤
singing in billie’s register is sooo incredibly hard. especially with the version of the greatest they did. you can tell billie was happy when it was over bc it was as she said very nerve racking for her! ❤ she is so amazing
~ bam bam bammm~ repeat 10000 times 😂
Can't stop listening to it😭  No need to turn on four audios when I can listen to Billie live in quality sound.
I sent this to her hope she watched this💫
I sense an insider at 15:23
She needs backing vocal
I like how she dress now, not cringe, but casual and girly
I'm not a big billie eilish fan, but this performance is out of this world
this 2 guys are fckn incredible... not just her that is obvious,  both are fantastic as a duo  <3
Yall are fake you know dam well she does not sound good with out reverb and auto tunes she can’t sing to save her life she even knows it she was so nervous
Bird of a feather!!!❤❤❤
Beautiful voice🫶🏻
Beautiful voice🫶🏻
I forgot what a “once in a generation” talent this brother and sister combo is. Love it
Excellent
honestly have no idea why Finneas is there. He's fr holding her back. Like can he just start his solo carreer and stop leaching fr.  Also, I'm sure people like Mariah's watching and thinking to themselves, wow, this is what they give grammys to these days? No ways
Her voice is sooo beautiful  I love you billie
I can’t look at anything other than her face she’s so beautiful
I love to see the artists' behaviour in Tiny desk! Its completely different than what we see on stage and it's awesome!
NPR can we have Taylor Swift back plz!🥲
finneas clapping for billie after every song is so big brother. you can see how much he loves and supports her
Legend 🔥
I love you is that songggg!!!
Taylor Gang! 🎸🫡👍🏼✌🏼
Thought that was Russ on the piano at first! lol 😁😁😁
I love youuuu Billie! Since 2016 🥰🥰
She really sounds sooooo good live 😍😍
Кайф
loves it
She's amazing, Finneas. You're amazing, Billie. ❤❤😢😅 Sorry I'm missing your concerts this tour.
ALBUM OF THE YEAR
Me wrapping my kids presents *billie at a tiny desk concert* me watching & rewatching and 2 hours go by. I have wrapped 1 present. Thanks so much😅
This is ok but Sabrina's is better...😔
birds of a feather was not as good as it should have been. Y'all heard it too.
She makes it sound so easy people dont even realize
Singing softly is so much HARDER she is crazy talented
This is absolutely astounding and truly unparalleled   However if you are loving her soft, emotional singing and control over her breathwork, and you haven’t seen it before, I highly recommend looking up the video of her singing When the Party’s Over on Howard Stern. Absolutely magical

I Haven't heard such a beautiful performance in years ...was not her fan lately but she really is one of the best singer that ever walked on this planet ...She looks amazing on top of it ... I am afraid i fell in love 😊❤😂😂😂😊
Betterhelp is a scam
How much is it to get in there? I bet tickets are like $1,000,000 haha 😂
thank you for existing Billie
15:21 HELP them both noticing her holding her hands out during the "oooo", laughing, then locking back in was too funny
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
❤❤❤ still amazing voices ❤❤❤
Big calm energy behind a tiny desk. ❤🙏
Why her voice when she sings birds of a feather so different with her album voice, too many autotune
That was really enjoyable - Thanks.
Now im a New Billie Fan 😮
A melancholy acoustic album needs to be done by Billie. She has the vocals for it!!!
🥲💎💚💜
How can heaven created such beautiful human 🥲 wish I could see her in my lifetime... I love her 💖
HERE FOR U BILLIEEEEEE
Such a delicately beautiful video caption/description, reflective of this performance. Mesmerizing.
She looks like a school girl who just stopped in after school to sing her heart out.
Di sini cantik kau bili
Who else comes to see this amazing performance at least 10 times everyday?
La neta ni canta tan chido
Every time someone likes this comment, I'll watch it again.
Why didn’t she do wildflower??
最高です！
meu deus obrigada
Where was the sound man on this tiny desk. Phineas’s guitar playing was overbearing to the point of so annoying I could not watch past halfway thru the second song omg.. FAIL. 🤦🏼‍♀️🙃☹️
She ateee the notes are tight !! 🔥
i wish that there was at least one woman in the band tho
❤️
Chills chills chills ❤
Whoever has been booking these artists in the past year needs to be promoted ❤
beautiful ❤
Aaaaakhhhh I love you Billie!
🫶 🥰🤩😘💯🌟 🫶
Reminds me of Dolly Parton 🥰
The worst singer of this generation meets the worst whatever the heck NPR is of this generation.
L'AMOUR THE MA VIE❤
very cool
Highland Park represent. We used to live on Avenue 50 just up from Fair Market. Good to see the local kids go big. It was a dangerous place when I lived there.
Don't know if someone is reading this, but if you are: it doesn't matter where you are right now on this planet, I wish you a wonderful day and a happy, peaceful life where all your dreams come true. You are amazing and beautiful! I believe in you!
Please do better, NPR, and stop promoting BetterHelp
ughhhh the i love you high note got me GAGGED
Is the box description person a portuguese speaker? 👀
I love the sibling bond they have.  Very talented family.
i love you unexpected appearance 10/10
slim pickins deserves full version to sing
Such beautiful singing, i love this tiny desk concept 🙏💜
Amazing, i can't stop watching ❤
i love you so much
call twenty one pilots please!!!!
"Birds of a feather" is my song for 2024-25
Amazing, perfect, phenomenal.
good times i was there. RIP LIAM
12:22 STAWP THE WAS FINNEAS IS LOOKING AT BILLY HAS ME CRYING ❤
greatest of our generation
amazing!!! I am a newly converted fan
Such a pure energy <3
Very good guys! I only say this because I think the Andrew the drummer can actually apply it…  Don’t be afraid to adjust the Tom muting  with your different implements it was so good tho! Perfect fit and intensity I felt your dynamics even within the required tessitura of the vibe
This was sooo enjoyable!!!
I am so in love with Billie. She is so lovely. ❤
te amo Billie, lo que tiene de preciosa lo tiene de talentosaaa
I love you has me in tears, she sang amazing
I could listen to her all day. Her voice is mesmerizing. And she sounds exactly the same live as on her album.
By any chance, is there a Finneas' Tiny Desks? It would be incredible to have one of them both, and I think he deserve it too (loving Billie's talent, as always ❤)
Havent heard her in a while.... she's soo good! Best of her generation by far! She can sing any song and she'll make the song her own just by singing it.
she has the most beautiful voice i have ever heard
insaneeeeeee 😭🩵
Her voice is literally perfect
can only imagine how thrilled their parents must be to watch them collab and care for each other so well ❤
Tiny Desk has and will always be MVP
Die Intimität des Formats wunderbar genutzt.
What kind of guitar was used on the first song? It sounds like a ukelele but has a fuller sound.
billie almost forgetting she is a human
ok but the pianist is hottt
Incrível, impressionante como ela consegue passar tanta emoção! E com o Finneas junto fica ainda melhor!!
6:46
im not even a billie fan anymore but i love you made me tear up bruh
Billie = 21 century Beatles
No chihiro so i cant like sorry !
😍😍😍
curious how their both sing with eyes closed such a family thing
Enchanting!
Betterhelp isn't a sponsor I'd ever expect to see on NPR. You need to do better than that.
wow, just wow..
Need a Finneas Tiny Desk
so soulful its almost RnB - airy/raspy but her little trills at the end of her phrases make it sound so soulful.
Melhor backing vocal desde o Mateus de Jorge e Mateus…
She melts metal. Chega a manteiga derrete…
You are sibling goals. <3
I wish you the best (TikTok sound) is at 6:49  your welcome! (Lamour de something 😂)
15:59 the note change 🥹
True.
what a talented people... what a joy :) ... as always, thank you tiny desk
Its meh honestly, Billie music withnout the production is not it, ofc thats my oppinion, most here would consider a hot take but i never was one who appriciated the vocal capebility that much, for me voice should be just another instrument
she doesn't sound that good, even off i'd say
Wow, music with feeling and emotiion.
I love tiny desk ❤
their voices make me cryyyy that’s how powerful and talented they both are Finneas and Billie you don’t know how much I love you.. love you guys so much!!! :(((
she's also got a head cold if u cant tell... which is incredible. so talented!!!
It went by so quickly! When I saw it it was already at the end
Just seen Sabrina carpenters tiny desk video on my fyp and was like. Yeah imma watch billies again
18:17 for the Birds of a Feather!
whos need a really chill?
Hauntingly beautiful.
Awesome, serene ❤🫶🏽❤️🫶🏽
My fave thing about Tiny Desk is seeing performers as humans
Ay bilita, tas bien bonita
This is my super bowl
Ahora traigan a los Beatles
Her smooth voice hits so hard in my nerves❤🥲🤌🏽
T H A N K.     Y O U
11:55  The way Finneas looks to Billie, a very passionate brother, you can see he loves his little sister very much and is very proud.
beautiful musicianship and her voice is so ethereal. Tiny Desk is the best. You can't hide behind production. It's just raw talent on display and I love that.
Now I need the finneas tiny desk pls
Ela canta com a alma e a gente ao ouvir, a nossa alma vibra junto. Surreal!
the way finneas is checking on her during I love you 😢 and her messing with her hands😭
How can someone sing this perfectly, it‘s insane
I really with these were uploaded in 4k for the higher audio quality.
THE GREATEST
Love you billie
My queen slay
I’m worried about how much weight shes lost I hope she’s okay 😢❤
Billie = Nicki Nicole
I love this I’ve watched sooo many times
Billie doesnt have a voice, everything about her is an experience.
never heard something better than billie singing acoustic versions of her songs.. i'm deeply in love <3
Voice is just so smooth and angel like 😇 love it.
idk its just me or something, i enjoying  billie music here, but idk every see her brother, its lil creepy lol S O R R Y. ;P
apenas empezó a cantar ya me emocioné, que hermoso tiny dek ♥
Angelina who?
It is just amazing to watch this artist, so natural  , relaxed in a non formal place.I love that You can appreciate the other members of the band.Thank You NPR Tiny Desk
Her and her brothers relationship is beautiful to watch
I always love to see how much Finneas and Billie love each other
I love when an artist is feeling their music so much that they close their eyes.
what a joy it is to watch sabrina perform ❤ and everyone did such an amazing job
Lovely! Pun not intended
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tiny desk shows if an artist is actually talented.
I Love her😍🥹
my giiiiirrrrrrlll my goodness, she absolutely killed this 🥲
why she didnt dress like a black person on here ?
Impresionante que con solo una guitarra y su voz logre tremenda interpretación. 🎆
Thank you!!!
Muito bom billieeeee
Ok,I accept her music now,thank you tiny desk and miss BILLIE!
She legit sings like an angel
😴😴
i love you. That freaking song will make me cry
Era necessário pelo menos 30 min de Billie cantando 🥺🤍
hi so this changed my life
my favorite at now
Woooow I always cry with her song I Love You 🥺
BILLIE ♥️🔥
is there a way to see the whole performance instead of just 4 songs?
I came to this video ready to be grumpy about it - we've all been so, so, so exposed to the "brand" of Billie Eilish that (for me, at least) it had overshadowed the music that she and her brother make.  I really like this, and I wonder if I'd be more receptive to the art she makes if it weren't buried underneath layers and layers of publicly-projected persona.  I know that's just how it goes.  Anyway, the music's great.
she sounds so beautiful
Just WOW 😮❤
Magnificent 😊
será que ela dá aula de canto?
This is a lovely concert... but did you know that BetterHelp is infamous for locking you into a subscription and making it as hard as possible to cancel while continuing to bill you? There's even reports of them trafficking sensitive health data. If anyone from NPR is reading this, please reconsider having them as a sponsor all the time. The constant mentions are making all of my friends question your trustworthiness.
great!!! 👌
''ive wanted to do this like my whole life'' ..... bruv u did it 4 years ago watchu mean
This tiny desk and the first take my favourites videos on YouTube for acoustic music. ❤
hermosa es un placer verla y oírla
Pristine👏👏👏👏
FINALMENTE!!!!! PERFEITA, IMPECÁVEL ❤
Not in the Billie fan club . But this performance gives a lie to all those who shout she has zero talent. That she can't sing . Just  whispers and mumbles etc. Bravo Billy !
The first song is insanely beautiful
12:00
She had wanted to do this her whole life… And here I am realising that some literal adults now were born AFTER THE CREATION OF YOUTUBE.  My mind is blown.
I would like to make a suggestion to Tiny Desk to make subtitles available in Brazilian Portuguese for Brazilian users. Unfortunately, I do not understand English fluently and I miss this availability to understand the songs and dialogues.
This is my first way of listening to her music. I never knew she could sing like this 🤯
So so good this is actually music
Her brother produces her music. What an amazing brother?
Appreciate the art and beautiful music, but also really appreciate the person who has to dust and clean that studio. Praise to them.
Nowhere to hide here. Note perfect. Exceptional 👌🏼
Les pubs qui coupent les morceaux … 😢 Respectez les artistes svp  Sinon merci pour vos Tiny et bigup pour cette session 🔥🔥🔥
Anyone in 2024? 😂
Did Justin beiber do one yet
Simplesmente perfeito 🥹
OMG…she is so surreal…the voice of an angel!! 😇
Las risas de fondo eran reales? Billie porfa casate conmigo.
eu amo a Billie e amo mais ainda ver como o Finneas olha admirado e orgulhoso pra ela.
She is just amazing. She has chops you have to be super human to cover her songs.
these last few months have i’ve been using a lot of music therapy since losing my dog, before he passed i would sing and dance with him any time birds of a feather or pink pony club (i first heard that song on npr) came on tiny desk concerts have helped me have a nice little full circle moment 🩵🩵
🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️🙇🏿‍♂️
Ty Billie ❤
Finneas’s harmonies are absolutely beautiful, they really need to make an acoustic album , i would listen to it on repeat!
I love Billie
Holy moly😩🤧❤️
their music saved my life multiple times... i'll forever be grateful
❤
Finneas deserves a break
mr meaty s singing.
Te amo billie
Finneas saying "you look cute" is everything to me
That’s so incredibly beautiful voice 💖
Thought she would sing meow meow meow meow 😂😂
If tiny desk has audience can I join👀🫣
this is dressed like a girl?!?! i cant believe anything she says ! to the 4k + people out there that dislike this video you're not alone :  i feel sorry for artists that have to lie to themselves everyday .. "ive wanted to do this for a long time" .... yeah you did it before. also fin is the genius she's just the face of the band. its sad to watch in real life. as a comment i could do without her and see what fin can do alone. tiny desk goes pop  ... yuck
Wow. All of it, but that first song is particularly out of this world. The way she delivers it, using every bit of her vocal ability to bring it together so sensitively. Wow 🙏
It's reeaaaally cool! Thanks for this album, thanks for this tiny desk it's the best Xmas gift ❤️
That was amazing, I just wanted to hear her sing all her songs lol.. I wanted to keep listening forever. Beautiful 🥰
Como essa menina é linda 😘❤️☝🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻
I can't stop listening. Been on repeat over and over again. Something so raw about her voice and lyrics I can't get enough of.
I love that this lady still gets nervous...insanely pleasing music.  Just amazing!  TDC comes through again.
brilliant
Renee Rapp tiny desk when she releases her new album PLEASE 😭
Lovely voice 🌹 nice to see the young people making it big!!! On their OWN
Wow.....The control is masterful...Combining the soft edges with such precision is EPIC.
What a treat. What a duo and what a voice.
Angelic voice. 💜
cara eu te amo
Absolutely beautiful, my favorite songs from that amazing álbum, Billie’s voice gives me chills ever i listen to 🤩
I'll be there one day
Been waiting for her to come back since covid. Back when they were at home with the cardboard cut outs.
Billie tiny desk gave me life... It was everything to me ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🥹💖🥹💖
An INCREDIBLE TALENT. I love Billie’s vocal ability
callate fineassss omggg... so annoyin :c
Muito bom. Parabéns!
sublime ❤❤❤
The way I ascended at 4:13 when all background paused for a moment and then fell back together with her, oof 🫶🏽
That was the best!! OMG😊
shoutouts to orangewood for that beautiful sounding guitar played by a brilliant songwriter and musician @finneas
shes so beautiful,  not only to look at but as a person and vocally.
Que regalo a la vida sos Billie
😴
Me gusta mucho Billie, pero esperaba la parte "alta" al final par que luciera su voz :(
SO OVERRATED...
WOW! That's talent.
Blondie Josh Klinghoffer
PLEASE BRING CAMILA CABELLO TO THIS SHOW IM BEGGING 😭
Wow!
Aw Billie has a most beautiful voice! I could listen to this on repeat all night.
Billie really that girl, I believe and soul whole heartedly will say this forever she top tier next to whit don’t @ me ! 😢
the way billie and finneas were in sync at 3:49 just makes so much sense
Tiny desk is so healing
Billie is perfect, isn't? L'AMOUR DE MA VIE it's my fav 🔝❤‍🔥
4:22 HEAVENLY
Love me some tiny desk and have for years ❤
I wish I could like this twice
whos this
She can't sing
love this
Her brother looks at her mad weird.
2-3 db less on finneas’ vocal
Their parents made a great job. So mature, so well educated with others, respect and after fame and money , they are so down to earth!!! Congratulations!!!
She's so cute & anxious (we usually never imagine folks like this to have anxiety.)  Can't wait to see her look back at this when she's 40!!
Exactly what I needed to end 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE this! No huge arena, big sound & lights. Only talent. Nice & intimate
So wonderful ❤
hermosa!!
Tiny Desk has this incredible ability of getting me to listen to artists I never would have guessed I'd be interested in listening to
Che meraviglia, grazie 🖤
I love you tiny desk!! ❤❤❤❤
I had goosebumps and chills for the whole of 'I love you'. I can't express how much I love that song- forever grateful they decided to do it for tiny desk.
Wow such talented this angel has.
Promoted partnerships now? With (not so)Betterhelp? What are we coming to?
Am I the only one who noticed the ride cymbal on pianist?  4:22
Perfection, even the dude in the back is shaking a Korok 🌿
I love Billie and Finneas❤
she is fit hot sexy beautiful gorgeous dam
when is the album out
You can even hear, how she clears her throat here 13:29. Clearly singing (almost whispering) this song would make your throat/vocal chords really itchy!
isso tá muito perfeito
So cool 😎 Love it ❤
dont sound like profecional singer only where there is instrument can sound good plastic rockstart
Eu sou feliz por viver na mesma época que a Billie. Obrigada pelas músicas que tocam minha alma, me emocionam ❤
Dudes, can someone check in on FINNEAS I'm concerned he might be the next Kurt cobain.
is this from now or is this old? So good
She got them he’s a tho
Muito talentosa. Não sabia que cantava tanto. Sensacional❤
"i love you" is also one of my favorites. This performance made my heart ache.
HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY BILLIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🎁🎁🎊🎊🎆🎆🎇🎇🎉🎉💯💯🍻🍻🎈🎈🎁🎁❤❤
Great , I really enjoy it
16:17 ily
ishuuu
A1. Music=Life
UGH HER VOICE IS AS SOFT AND DELICATE AS HER HAIR.
Hearing people say Billie is not a good live vocalist drives me insane. She has an AMAZING voice.
SHE SANG J LOVE YOU TF
@CECIDOVER
❤❤❤
I know Billie since she was a young girl singing melancholic songs and till this day, the way she puts her soul in every word she sing gives me chills, and Finneas know how to sing with her so perfectly... Just pure talent 🌹
Very good but hard to go from the amazing display of Chappell Roan and then get real excited about this one.
the voice control is insane
This was kinda bad…
Honestly this was excruciatingly slow and sleepy but everyone else in the comments enjoyed it so that cool for you  🤣
This is the best sounding Tiny Desk Episode, they nailed it. Billie's voice, the band, the mixing, its all perfect.
GREAT one, Billie! :)
THE TALENT this two have transcends boundaries, you just feel them.
no good singer. Why she is that famous?
They are incredible! Also, can you please invite MCR?
Auuuuu thanks for that
I love her she's amazing i can listen to her everyday all day 😄 she did the tiny desk but 4 years ago and it was Covid season so no audience 😉
not betterhelp!! common NPR you can do so much better, what is this?
yo ya como atomo marca lobos
This too good I unliked it
the eilish brothers
put Ari next!!!!!
RICAAAAA
I need SZA on tiny desk for her new deluxe!!
Cried the moment iloveyou started playing….
I love it when a concert is actually about the music
LOVE from Italy❤
absolutely gorgeous and absolutely ethereal. just wow. speechless and tearing up.
These songs are the musical embodiment of my heartbreak ❤‍🩹
Anybody knows what the guitar that Finneas is using in the first song?
you can see how much effort they put into the performance. great respect to Billie, Phineas and the team infront and behind the scene who make this happen.
Finneas looks at her like a proud dad its so cute lol
Jak zwykel w punkt.
10/10
In fact it's not her singing but it's Milli Vanilli behind the bookshelf.
Yeah, she definitely has a gift
Nobody has listened to “I love you” more than me omgggg.
She's so pretty😩
Next, an autistic album 🙏
Better than original
Oh come on NPR. Do your research before taking on a scummy sponsor like Betterhelp.
mal asesorada, super fome su Tiny desk, queda en evidencia que no tiene mala voz pero sin producción no brilla
can we have one with demi lovato next 🤍
I Love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤ я тебя люблю серьёзно я  Behzod из Узбекистан
Lo malo de los Tiny Desk es que terminan.
Guys Better help is a scam
Incredibly beautiful, so full of soul!  Big hats off from Bangladesh!
Que acústico maravilhoso! Escutando aqui e sinto uma leveza!
To the guy who wrote the caption for this video, thank you. What a beautiful way to describe my feelings.
Xoxo!❤
love when Billie "goes girl" - you go girl!
That wonderful version of the greatest reminds me the beautiful melodics and rhythm of Jason Mraz; and it just hug my heart 🫂🫀
I cried
Love you Billie and Finneas. Thanks for everything 🩷
This is soo good
This is absolutely moving! 😢
<3 hemosoooooooooo
19:27 i know yall waiting for that hitter
Lovely performance! Like it!!
i love billie eilish
is this a fadu?
She sound a little bit like The Dö in the 1st song.1
👏🏻🔥 Billie&Co
I don’t even listen to her and this set was amazing
How do I like twicee😭
She sang beautifully until Birds of Feather... Boy, she messed up there! Great song though.
When she said ‘I wanted to do this my whole life’ but forgot she did a Tiny Desk just 4 years ago 👀
OK...is it really the best thing since sliced bread ? ;-)
>>>>>>>>>>>18:25<<<<<<<<<<<<
now all i need is each performance to be turned into an EP so i can shuffle songs on a playlist :D
Sweetheart Billie😍😍😍😍
* i am not crying. you are
Billie forgetting she’s already done tiny desk before 😂
Tracklist: 00:20 The Greatest 06:43 L’Amour De Ma Vie 11:52 I Love You 18:26 Birds Of A Feather
All colloquial comments aside, I wonder how Billie, Jesca Hoop, Finneas, and Sam Beam would sound collaboratively 🤔🥹 *just a thought. I’m so glad this here Tiny Desk exists though. Such subtleties can be so easily missed. 🫠🖤🌹
brother you ruined it
This chick is coldddd stilll
Reminds of this one special someone, who isn't special anymore but the love is still there
Her vocals are fricken incredible 😭
ilove you billie!!!! thank you for your music!!!
❤
Finneas is Bon Iver part 2
this girl just gets better and better , amazing set x
not singing wildflower is crazy 😭😭😭😭😭
I would remind everyone that npr and tiny desk is almost entirely sponsored by individual donations, they cannot keep us from our art and everything if we keep it going.
Amazing ❤❤
pls invite rosé here to perform her new songs from her rosie album 🥺
Love Billie 🤍 idk where to leave the requests for who should be on tiny desk next but I think Lana Del Rey should be on 🤍🤍🤍
Neil Tevault the best Audio Engineer in the universe!!!!
My daughter ❤
This was perfect. Please concider SZA next
Using only vibrato without any reverb is absolutely amazing!
8 million views in a week
Finneas with the constant glances made me uncomfortable but, badass set.
Sounds like liquid gold.
Whenever I hear someone my age long for the way music was made in the 60s and 70s, the rebuttal begins with Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell.
11:50 I love you   18:10 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
TINY DESK IS AMAZING, im sorry not sorry but her voice is not special or worth this kind of stardom. There are SO many women that outperform her with smaller followings.
Happy birthday 🎈
You'a neKst 008

Wow
The sound engineer for Tiny Desk is the real MVP here.
When will we have a tiny desk with bruno mars? I hope so much one day it will become a reality
Gracias por este regalo de navidad pequeño escritorio 🐟🌈
i love you is just always gonna be my fav. i love her omg omg
🔥
Sorry, but I fail to see the brilliance...  And it's just my opinion, ok? It's not the end of the world. We're aloud to have opinions in the XXI century, right?
I'm currently crying rn bcs she sang "I love you" again <3
she looks like such a beautiful angel
I love you healed me
life is fcking awesome in the end of the year, luv u bills
what mic are they using?
Billie Eilish on Tiny Desk!
Going in the Spotify playlist
Creo que mis oídos fueron bendecidos.
minute 11:53 is why i fell in love with this girl - HAPPY BIRTHDAY BILLIE!!! 🎈 i 💚 you
Madre miaaa!!! Esque no tengo palabras!!!! Tu voz es poesía!❤
I love hows shes always doing things with her brother
seeing finneas and billies bond here really warmed my heart, makes me miss my older brother a lot. you can see how much he loves his baby sister and how proud of her he is.
im in love
her voice is so smooth
Trash
Aburrido
You are beautiful and alive
YESSSS OMMMMMMGGGG
6:28 did she forget she did a tiny desk 4 years ago? Lol
¡BRAVA!
Putting ads in the middle of the songs is just foul.
so beautiful <3
love ya all...
can you guys add this in Spotify its a NEED
I'd like everytime I listen to this. top 10 TDC easy
awesome Billie 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Omgggg
That’s a genius.
Billie's therapy's even more efficient when you see/hear this magic happen live. moved me so much to witness something so genuine, so skillful and yet humble, simple, straightforward... This is the healing and comforting voice and sound of many more than her "generation". thanks a lot to have made this possible.
Que babação de ovo
It’s giving Civil Wars but better
the nfirst time i watched a tiny desk concert was for hobo johnson now billies here I cant believe it
Se ve la humildad de los músicos y eso es muy valioso
i love they focused everyone except for the guy in the right  JAJAJAJAJAJAJ
I love my Sagittarius sister real bad. So talented 🫶🏽
Wanted to hear Wildflower though 😩
Top
Jeff Buckley would have been so proud, I feel, to have inspired Billie Eilish ❤ And I hope Jennifer Charles feels the appreciation, too. 💓Pretty obvious influences, both of these wonderful artists 😊🥰
Happy 23th Birthday To You, Billie Eilish! 🥳🎈🎂🎉🎊🎁🤗🫂🍺🍻🥂🍸🍾🎤👩‍🎤🇺🇸❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎❣️💕💞💓💗💖💘💝💟💌🫶  December 18, 2001 – December 18, 2024  And Finally, Billie Eilish 🤝 Tiny Desk Concert
i'm ngl, ads during a tiny desk performance should be illegal,  pls somehow play them all at the beginning or something, total vibe killer
She's so wonderful.
This reminds me of singing with my best friend. (: You can really tell when someone’s been singing together since childhood
Haven't seen a beautiful sibling synergy like this since Richard and Linda Carpenter.
Why they all dressed like MCR “Im Not Okay” era
Billie’s voice has matured so much. She already had a beautiful, soothing voice but it’s like now, she’s getting to a point where she plays with her range. I love to see it, forever a fan!
NPR!!!!! DO A DARKIE NPR, AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!!!!!!!!
I can't get over... how appreciated she..finally is..
SO GOOD 🤟
Thank you Heidi ❤️
effortless
Wow. Just incredible.
😲
i need to see shawn mendes on tiny desk asap
Love how Billie introduces Finneas as her brother. Anytime Finneas plays for Billie, he always claps for her - so loving! One of the BEST Tiny Desk Concerts EVER!
This went so fast what the FLIP
"I love you" just the best song of Billie Eilish
Tiny Desk makes us happy again!
‏‪20:57‬‏ I like this part very much
‏‪15:57‬‏ This part gives me goosebumps
love you billie 💙✨
Billie Eilish AND FINNEAS
Whether the style of music is my preference or not, I totally respect artists who compose and perform original music.  The passion and perfection separates these two from 80% or more of the other people performing out there today.
sayanggg sayaaaaa
Birds Of A Feather crazy
00:16 “THE GREATEST" 06:41 “L’AMOUR DE MA VIE" 11:04 “i love you" 17:10 BIRDS OF A FEATHER"  I choose to not skip any of the commentary and introductions with these timestamps to the songs.
le faltó punch a su voz o era el micro? :(

come to besiktas
Come on people, do your research. BetterHelp is a scam!
didnt like
she closes her eyes a lot. I guess that's her safe space where she really enters that pain that she sings to hauntingly with <3
Birds of a feather flock together.
Cuando te veo, te veo pasarl
Most beautiful girl in the world. 🫠
literally thee BEST duo EVERRRR ! thank God for Billie Eilish & Finneas😭❤️❤️❤️
Shout out to the post-production team for such a perfect mix. Billie is so fire, and the arrangement/composition is on a level so phenomenal. Just wow....  I want to see more of such dedication to this marvelous art called music. What a beautiful piece of the human experience.  Just WOW!
Just watched Billie on VF eighth year♥️
Happy Birthday, Miss Billie
Her breathwork is CRAZY incredible
You are very special to me.
Stop putting the f***** ads DURING the songs!!!!
Simplesmente a melhor 🌟
I went to college with the pianist. Genuinely one of the most talented musicians I’ve met.
Please Tiny desk producers, bring Dillom from Argentina to your set, he's very talented, and his last album ''Por Cesarea'' would make a great mix with your musicians
All the songs🔥🔥….'I love you' and 'Greatest'💌
phenomenal, the best since soul glo and it might top it
Mds q mulher incrível ❤!!
i love this <3 where is sabrina claudio
The fact that she sounds the exact same live as she does on the track is insane. So talented
Прекрасно 🌹
This is the "Easy Listening" singer-songer writer music of the 70's, 80s and 90's but for now. Yes, I'm in my 40s and enjoying some Billie.
OMG,LOVE GIRLS
Wow
Amazing to be able to do this live. I guess she has perfect pitch and just hears it. Brilliant.
Okay I love NPR but please don’t promote better help. They are a scam
I have fallen so in love with her as a performer from this. The soul that are in these vocals and the sheer effortlessness she exudes in this performance has blown me away. She's phenomenal and this is in top 5 of favourite Tiny Desk episodes. ♥
Ever since Hobo Johnston I've been in love with Tiny Desk. Keep doing what you are doing. 100% net positive to the world.
I was in the top 0.01% of Billie listeners :')
This is truly something.  Quite possibly the best one yet.  Great job Tiny Desk!
This was breathtaking! Now I need a Finneas solo tiny desk as well
Yes, you are the greatest <3
She is an absolutely ghoulish looking woman
Better Help is a zionist organization.
Just realized it's not JUST Billy eillish tiny desk. Her EXTREMELY talented brother Finneas is also playing acoustic guitar so really it's Billy and finneas tiny desk concert which is even better. And anyone that hasn't looked up his music what are you doing with your life. His song "the kids are all dying" just goes to prove he's equally as talented. And many people don't realize Billy learned a lot from her brother and he's a big part of what propelled her to sucess and made her so talented. My family was a similar way where my parents were musicians, and I had a brother 5 years older that really was like a mentor for me and taught me a lot. Wonderful dynamic and we have a lifelong and closer connection because of it that's just different in the best of ways.
Really one of the softest voices of sweet nectar. Way better live and in formats like this.
Pleaseee call Taylor Swift again, I want betty live at tiny desk concert
Happy birthday BILLIE EILISH ❤
I went to her LA show and became an even bigger fan!! Go Billie! Thank you tiny desk!
She’s soooo adorable 😢 I shed a tear or two ❤
Beautiful raw authentic voice. She’s such a talented artist.   In my opinion PERFECTION
Billie Poland love you❤❤❤❤❤
can we see Tiny Desk Concert of Alec Benjamin
Finneas Look like Jack Grealish with this haircut
so much stuff in this room
12:09 so anyway I started crying (no joke)
I listen Birds of a Feather at least 10 times a day. 18:28
PLEASE DONT TAKE SPONSORSHIPS FROM BETTER HELP. They are not an ethical mental heath organization nor do they have qualified individuals. I'm disappointed in you Tiny Desk.
She is the best thing happened to music since Damien Rice
The Girl became a Woman
The Alton’s next
please upload them to spotify!
WE NEED THE ACOUSTIC VERSIONS OF THESE SONGS ASAPPP
❤❤❤
😭♥🎀
Who's that guy? 😐
Amo a Billie, y esto fue hermoso!!  pero hemos pedido otro tiny de Aurora por a;os. Ayuda
Her voice is just so magical
QUEEEN, FALTOU CHIHIRO
I'm 1000% completely obsessed. Happy Birthday Billie! Phenomenal work and completely unparalleled <3
The only problem is that it ends
11:15 she introducing her brother, btw 🥹
that seems to me like a fairly large desk
Thankfully Billie is still Holding space for real music❤
mi Billie ♥ siempre supe que eras una geniazaaaaaaaaaa
is there a spotify for this ?
I love you always hits hard...
She is PHENOMENAL!!!!! Her voice way beyond her years. And the way her brother looks at her, you can see the love and adoration he has for her. GREATEST Tiny Desk Concert!! ❤️❤️
god I love her
Finneas looks so stinkin' proud of his sister. <3
Loveee it❤️❤️❤️
Yo
Pls take rosè also ❤
Depressive.
I’ve watch this so much in these past 5 days…
good stuff
Zzzzz, zzzzz, zzzzz
PEACE 🍁🍂  🌎✌🏾🐸
I would love to see Cole or Kendrick do Tiny Desk. Billie killed this 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
perfect, perfect, perfect
Finally I get to hear her sing on tiny desk ❤️🫡🙌👑
Miau miau miau miau
Birds of a feather is such an incredible track, she absolutely nails it here
So, No "Meow meow meow!!!"😿😿😿
it's nice she let hobbits join the band
Nice song
she's so beautifulll, hpbd billie <33
Where is Wildflower ? 😭😭
How come tiny desk always sounds so good? We need some BTS!
the laughter, sister and brother together at 15.24 👫 beautiful
Perfection ❤
Amazing 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Simply stunning.
WE NEED ROSALIA AT TINY DESK
💖💖💖
Figured NPR would be better than Betterhelp but guess not
It's impressive how well the whole thing is mixed behind the “tiny desk”. Sounds very good.
My baby got so many bruisses hope shes okay
"Saudade is a Portuguese word that can be roughly defined as a feeling of melancholy, nostalgia or yearning for something that is beloved but not present. There's no perfect translation, but one of the closest English expressions of the word I've ever seen is Billie Eilish's Tiny Desk performance." - as a fellow portuguese here, you are absolutely correct!!!!!
Surreal!!
auto tune left the chat
Tiny Desk <3
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
no one understands how big of a deal it is to me that she played i love you this is my superbowl fr
perfect!
One od the songs sounds like its going to Hallalujah
Gah dam sis ain’t aging well
Angels
This is beautiful. Everyone did amazing  ❤❤

Her voice is not good
Good voice and good sound.
Man y’all gotta get Chris Brown on here it’s Long Overdue.
🖤🫶
he is too loud. let her sing
Que rara está Nicki Nicole...
Another Big Artist on The Tiny Desk!! Sound Amazing!
Ruin my life Billie
👏👏👏unique voice unique sounds salute🫡🇵🇭love to sing love you
Breathy singing is difficult because it takes so much more control.   She has mastered that.  Great story tellers.  Great musicians .    Love Tiny Desk
this is 🔥
Te amo
Harmonies as hauntingly angelic as those of John Paul White and Joy Williams when they performed as The Civil Wars
so good
this was so stripped down and all songs are most raw and created , her sound is so beautiful
She deserves all this praise ❤🥹
Soo talented!
❤🎉😊
The plant is back!
Wasn't Betterhelp selling their patients infos tho?
OMG. Real talent here ladies and gentleman. ❤
Crying isn’t like youuuuuuuuuu
Los amo :3
Wasn't she going to leave US? 😅
Love this tiny desk but imagine her collabing with Mac miller’s tiny desk concert… in an alternate reality
I love you Billie, thanks for everything 😭🤍
I love you  My fav
How many times have I played this? Yes.
These two are the new "Carpenters"...👍
l'amour de ma vie 🎉 my fav ❤❤
Incredible harmonies
These are the most painful ad breaks in the history of yt.
William Eyelash
It’s great to hear her perform without a bunch of fans singing along
That’s the guy from glee!!!
Ooh yeah, tear it up, Billie n Finny!
I love you gives me chills every time!
I never appreciated until this sensitive performance the difficulty of working in that acoustic environment so full of dampening items such as  books and carpet. Not exactly a resonant space. Kudos to the technicians.
Please Muse!
It was so nice to get to just listen to her and the band and not also 1,000 screaming ppl 😂
She truly stays the GOAT
Invite Ariana Grande please❤
パーフェクト！！
Love you billie💗🇲🇨
God I love this woman! I seen her in concert recently and it’s exactly the same 🥺
Wow, I had forgotten that Billie and her brother are really great musicians. Greetings to the band, really nice goosebumps.
I'm in a loss for words. What a great Tiny Desk Concert! I just need to say that I really liked that Finneas did backing vocal. That elevated everything. I would love that on the studio albums as well. Where ever that would fit.
🥰
Is it crazy I’m a fan of finneas too I wanna see more of him lol
poo poo stinky!
18:25 😭
Anyone else catching Civil War vibes?
Anamaria Sayre, your description of Billy's music is so spot on and beautiful. I was wondering why I was feeling emotional while listening, then I read what you wrote, and it made sense. Thank you for your incredible words.
Don’t wanna say goodbye 20:57
What's the name of the first song. That was epic, but my first time hearing it.
Billie's most genuine performance I've EVER seen ♡ made me shed a tear with "BIRDS OF A FEATHER"
I love Ireland 🇮🇪😊
“I love you” is one of my favorites songs ever. The way it rips my soul everytime i hear it…
imagine knowing youre the one who broke biliies heart at 16, poor thing lol, where are you now my guy? :3
what a voice!
It's so great to see artists live! I love the character and imperfections!! She is lovely❤❤❤
Wow ❤
So much better than TS!
DISSAPOINTING SONG CHOICES

🎉🎉🎉😂😂❤
billie
Eu amei demais! A Billie brilha muito! 💫
Just a wonderful talent.
You're absolutely from another planet , so special and beautiful .... goosebumps ❤
This is exquisite.
She's sooooo Beautiful!!!!
só 22 minutosssssssssssssssssssssss?????????????????????????????????? tenha que ser pelo ao menos uns 40 minutos, né????? Te amo Billinhaaaa e banda perfeita!!!
she gon move me to tears every time. her voice is so melancholy, it has lived beyond her years. she deserves every ounce of her meteoric success.
I wonder how billie feels about the band HIM and Ville Valo's voice in particular
Billie is a cutie!  Beautiful eyes.
This is my actual favorite Tiny Desk because BIRDS OF FEATHER just get better and better in this acoustic version <3 <3
I put my lunch down so my own chewing could stop interrupting this masterpiece. what a talent, wow.
How could such an emotional and perfect voice be real???
Tremendous platform for great artists. Maluma has been the worst.
With so many different sources trying to tell you what's hot and what's not..... Tiny Desk is a stand-out reliable stream of recommendations. When a new drop comes out, I'm listening! Some great new stuff and strong reminders to revisit other artists and bands you may have forgotten - they all still got it! Great performance
O'Connell brothers are pure genius. Greetings from Buenos Aires.
Bom demais ❤!
TE AMO MUITO
They did I love you 🥹🥹🥹🥹

18:28
so crazy good. production to execution
My favourite tiny tiny part 4:47
The Queen... Her Magesty Billie Ellish...
She is not even a good singer .
Merci pour ces textes et cette émotion... ♥
Real talented, young people. I missed this ❤
it might be the most beautiful thing I§ve seen and hear this year
Yes.
aww my billie
Every Tiny Desk Concert is a masterpiece! Regardless if the featuring artist is my cup of tea or not.
Love the set list!
BETTER HELP... REALLY? sad
La bandera de Mexico atras de Finneas ;)
I have to say I love you
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I wish Billie and Finneas would make a song together. I mean they always make music together but you know what I mean
She has a beautiful voice. My daughter and I are big fans of hers.
I love 💕 you..." xuxú"
Wow, this was beautiful 💜 A jam session with Billie and Finneas would be my absolute dream.  Inspiring how they’re both equally gifted and their skills complement each other perfectly 🥹 X x
Bom demais!
As a brazillian, it's actually really cool to see my language being widespread, and see a mention to a very important word in our vocabullary: "Saudade". If you miss someone, you say that in here. "Estou com saudades". And it means a lot, really. "I miss you" it's not very precise when you translate it literally.   I'm really happy to see this.   Billie can be translated to "Saudades"
These stripped down versions feel like what she and Finneas came up with on the floor of her bedroom those many years ago. A whole album like this would be great.
Wild that they got two Kenny G's to play the drums and keys
This is nothing short of fantastic
Nothing is going to stop me from loving billie😢❤😊
Why did a commercial just appear in the middle of the first song?!?
Im not a hater. She Is mediocre.
Billie should do a worship album.
The Greatest 😍
This was AMAZING!! I hear her in a completely different light here.
I would like to have a brother that looks at me the way Finneas looks Billie
i like "i love you"
LOVE FINNEAS
Another Tiny Desk with a golden performance! I must say those musicians are spot on! The clothes really suit her. Artists who can genuinly sing live are so underrated. Oh man there's so much things good and positive to say about this video...
Those subtle throat movements are speaking directly to my lizard brain.
Oh my goodness that was goooooooooooooddddd.
Her voice really is quite weak and unspectacular.
Beautiful
Asif she didn’t sing the song ‘dirty’.  Kai’s new tune with her on it
ILY😍 21:04
she literally transformed music for me, thanks Billie
I neeeeeed a second Billie Tiny Desk, so many good songs missing hereeeee wowowowowow
2:37 minutes in and this is already so good. wow.
Anyone else remember when Tiny Desk Concerts were reserved for up and coming artists? Now, it's just people who are already extremely wealthy/famous/have made it.   I love Billie don't get me wrong, but would love to see smaller artists get a chance.
sorry but i prefer autotune, bad lyris and extravangant artist that doesn't deserve fame !
omg!!! this is amazing!!!
JesuGuejo !
Amazing concert!.. THANK YOU for putting these together!! In complete support of NPR getting financial support from commercials, just wondering if there is a way to have them play inbetween songs instead of right in the middle of each one.
Nailed it! Killed it!
I hope their parents are crying from immense love and pride for their kids each time Billie sings and Fineas writes music
Their songs are so wonderful..like...its enough to have just billies voice and guitar and each song still would be fantastic and mesmerising! Oh ppl of U.S. you are so lucky to have Billie and Fineas! Pls protect and cherish them at all costs!!
her voice is magical
Perfection! You can see how Billie sings from her soul... She can feel every word she's saying. It's so beautiful to see
Live records often capture a raw energy and authenticity that studio versions can’t fully replicate
Justice for Chihiro
Her facial features will always be absolutely exquisite.
Wow, you're creative billie💗💗💗
The way Finneas just looks at Billie... I can't cope
This was an incredible performance by the whole band. Thank you!
Billie, why do all of your songs make me cry 😭 they be hitting so deep 😭 thank you ❤
Did she forget that she was at tiny desk before?
Anyone else watching and crying while they should be getting to work?
how does she do that with me??? <3 <3 <3
She sounded a bit out of breath on birds of a feather
Really disappointed in NPR  taking betterhelp money
Friendly reminder that betterhelp is a scam
This is so far the best tiny desk concert ❤
Did she forget she's done Tiny Desk before? Lol
Her smile in the thumbnail..💙💙
Lots of great hair
Who hurt you
YES YES YES IVE NEEDED THIS FOR YEARS THANK U ILY TINY DESKKK
(S)he (can't know for sure in holllywood) knew about the paedophile in the scene and stull chose to work for/with them.  Disgusting.
Best Tiny Desk ever!
The drummer is a clock <3
NPR doing better help scams too? Pretty sad.
Billie eu te amoooooooooooooo
no había escuchado la música de Billie Eilish, qué bonito 🥰
maaan with guitar stop singing jeeez  ruined song
16:56 "I'm not that old!" "Can I stand?" "Sure you can"
Crying throwing up, the most amazing!!!❤❤❤
Her and Phineas work together really well. His harmonisation is great.
love the way she does it
2 Oscars 5 Grammy's and many more and she will soon be 23. Amazing!
bilie foi cirurgica quando escreveu L'AMOUR DE MA VIE
I love NPR but they should really look into Betterhelp's many scandals and consider never taking another one of their sponsorships again.
where is Chichiro? :(
Stunning!
My god they’re just so incredibly talented. It’s so refreshing to listen to them in the midst of today’s noise.
This perform of the first song "The Greatest" made me shiver
Billy - make a song bout diddy
1OF1
ENTREVISTA DE 10
Absolutely captivating!
Disappointedly she don't play her full album 😭
We want Kodak Black Next
I love youuuu❤
so... i will be needing this on spotify somehow because her songs with finneas vocals louder are always so good
Simply stunning... my deep respects to the artists, the production team and everyone else involved to bring this beauty to my screen. Finneas is the king of harmonizing really; it gives such depth to all the Billie's songs <3
The Ads really ruin the songs. I mean if you have such an emotional songs and in between comes an Ad….😢😢😢😢😢😢
appreciete Billie for coming back in The Tiny Tesk no matter how big she is now
Still mesmerized by the voice(s), so luvely, like to sing along! Cheers M8!
The Colombian flag above her seems so kul
brazil 🇧🇷
Im 42 so seen a lot of artists over the year but Billie is up there among the best female artists. Would have loved to have seen her duet with Amy Whinehouse.
This girl has an angel's voice.
Sunset rollercoster please ❤
Goshhhhh Billie is an absolut angel 😍
18:25
Мне 52 года, и это так замечательно слышать это исполнентие! Спасибо Billie и всей команде!!! ❤✊🇱🇹
I was expecting for this tiny desk.. i love it!!!! Love you Billie<3 much love from argentina!! So much xx
Im Big fan. thanks
Shes great but Aurora is better
Me thinking all the time: Gosh Billie is absolutely stunningly beautiful ❤
She's so authentic, and her music is coming right from her soul❤
What Mics are those?
Good job Billie
Finneas is great at many things, like totally great except harmonizing ig.
She looks so happy 🥹
Lovely performance but that last one Birds of a Feather is NOT suitable for her voice at all.. how that became number 1 i have no idea.
Can we have a FINNEAS tiny desk soon pls
woooww   bird of feather  she sing here its like a whole new songs
One headphone to two headphone slide down soon as I heard the duo harmony
biasa aja suaranya dah. lagi masuk angin ga enak badan kali ya
I wonder what it takes to clean the dust from all the surfaces with all that stuff on the shelves, or do they just reassemble the whole background before every gig?
How many people in the audience? Sounds like a lot!!!
*YUK !* That people like creepy sap like this shows just how weird and sick people  are now. This stuff SHOULD make  anyones skin crawl.
She gets lost inside herself. Remarkable.
Beautiul Billie Loveyou!
ohno, betterhelp got to tiny desk 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This could heal my father.
cool
I've never watched a tiny desk session I didnt like till now. I thought this was terrible music and vocals
Adds pop up in the middle of songs, destroying the flow. I tried to watch it two times and wasn't able
NOT DOING WILDFLOWER IS CRIMINALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
🥹
well... that was interesting ig
WOW! I’m cooked af rn listening to art ✨
Finneas's harmonies are somehow better live ❣
Billie and her brother are a TOP DUO!
0:21 The Greatest 6:45 L'amour De Ma Vie 11:07 I Love You 17:14 Talk: Band Introductions 18:20 Birds Of A Feather
Not me crying when she sang I love you 🥹🩷
“Easy, guys.. I put my pants on just like the rest of you -- one leg at a time. Except, once my pants are on, I make gold records.”  - Bruce Dickinson
Yay! My girl crush... 🔥🔥👏👏😍🫶🫶
These were the fastest 20 Minutes of my life. Wow. I love you Billie Eilish :3
No one loves ILY like I do😭
2:45
just found me clapping on my own at the end
This feels more like the Thanksgiving Day parade than Tiny Desk... I am disappointed. Very processed with a few moments of brillance, the mix lacks the tiny desk magic, especially the crowd sound, which comes off soooooo fake.
I love how piano man is enjoying the music and looking at the others
I love her so much
🩶🍵EST 🫰🏽
The finesse demonstrated by the band here is pure joy to watch - so tactful and complementary to the duo's flawless vocals.
I love you is deepest song I've heard , its touch your soul❤
First time I thought of paying for no adds…not a regular Eilish fan,  but this, stunning.
I'm becoming a Billie Ellish fan in 2024
The way Finneas looks at her with such admiration is beautiful. Their bond is beautiful ❤
that I love you at 21:10 was so heavenly 😮
She has such a delicate voice. I dislike her newer, really pop-ish music. I’d love to see her do some indie and more acoustic stuff, I think it would really complement her vocal style.
It’s actually wild that Billie is 22?!?!   Like why did I think she was the same age as Halsey?????  Ugh I’m so jealous.  She has such a natural talent, yet has audibly grown as a vocalist since she first came out… amazing 😻
These two are such amazing artists. And Billie’s eyes are just so mesmerizing 🥺❤
she is literally so radiant in the thumbnail, she seems truly happy here and i hope she is🥹🫶
the second song gives me huge Laufey vibes <333 they would make a beautiful song together fs!
0:21 - THE GREATEST 6:43 - L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 - i love you 18:26 - BIRDS OF A FEATHER
her voice is so hauntingly beautiful. I’m absolutely mesmerized when she sings. everything in the world disappears when I listen to her
OMGGGGG HER VOICE IS BEYOND ASCENSION 🤍
Por qué no cantaron Wildflower?! 😭
WOW her voice has gotten better with lessons! The runs are such a beautiful touch. I wish this was longer 😭😭
I knew I would love this before it even started!!! 🥰
Finness reminds me of Sanji from One Piece 😂 love their singing so muchhhhhhh
She is simply fantastic. Finneas is great as well.
Get rod wave for tmy desk concert
She is sexy in the most lovable way
2:27 BRO MISSED 💀💀💀
Instant goosebumps! 😍🥰💜 so talented
This made my heart ache. In all the best ways. The breath control and restraint is astonding. And his harmonies . It's pure.
We love you...dont throw things,or I will find you...❤
again?
Congratulations on #1 true talent ❤
Wow 🔥🔥✨
no canto el miau miau miau miau
Hermoso
Being in a uni band, I can tell y'all those songs are HARD to sing well, she really slays
Finneas is a great producer but even a greater sound engineer. I consider myself to be a talented sound engineer and I recognize just how talented he is to get her sound to be NEXT LEVEL
You’re just showing off now, Tiny Desk. 🤜🏽🤛🏽
My toxic trait is thinking I sound like her when I sing..
11:53
is that a dude or a chick???
Beautiful 👏🏾
Greatest giving serious Civil Wars vibes (the band)
fantastic, truly
Ela cantou Love You....................... 🤧🤧🤧🤧
im TRYING to give Billie a chance but i just cant, im really trying, 3 minutes in and im falling asleep already,  i just cant.
la piba canta! es mainstream pero canta! bravo!
wow
MINHA PRINCESAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 🥰
So happy she got to sing i love you 🥺🥺 one of my fave songs
Needed a break from work and watching her feel herself and the band is everything worth taking it all in and stopping paperwork!!!! Love her!!!!
Chama o Gusttavo Lima
I LOVE HER SO MUCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Talking about "Saudade" in the video description is a Brazilian proud 🇧🇷
I love how precise and gentle her voice is. every small inflection is chefs kiss.
Her tone is so wonderfully conversational, I always feel like she's telling me a story and not just making pretty noises at me. It's so gripping.
Beautiful!
Thank you Tiny Desk- thank you Billie Eilish!- enjoyed it immensely!
Microsoft Sam voice: Presenting from Tiny Desk Corporation... The Tiny Desk Concert! A totally new and original idea that we never took any inspiration for or violated any copyright laws to make only money for ourselves off of somebody else's original idea that we stole!
Amo su voz y este álbum 💙
Billie and Finneas ate this ALL the way up!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love how Finneas looked on Billie every time ❤
I think spelled that correct. Eat me ai
Unreal talent
Why isn't everyone else in the world better,?
I was apparently not giving this young lady nearly enough credit for how fantastic of an artist she is.
Sufro de diarrea crónica. Hace varios años. Cuando me río, no puedo evitar cagarme encima. Por esto, hace ya un tiempo largo, me he convertido en un hombre silencioso y triste.... Necesitaba contárselo a alguien, aunque sea por este medio...
nahh, it's defo her in ksi's song😂
amazing
I wish Billie didn't feel so obligated to work with her brother. There are so many far more talented, exciting producers she could team up with but she continues to squander her immense potential with boring, redundant production. Her loyalty is admirable but this is nepotism at its most egregious, let's be real.
😍😍😍😍
Someone at youtube should be fired. I just only now discovered this channel and format. Well it's 2am and i gotta get up at 9.. wish me luck
She shoulda performed dirty
The audience impact is too much wish it was more chill, but the audio is crisp!! Billie is always amazing love it!!
Niun brillo
If I could hear Bored acoustic or unplugged I would probably melt away
billie eilish is life
Hay billie hay like
Billie is insanely talented. She’s such an old soul.
I love you hit diff
Was never a big fan of Billie, but this is a fantastic set, and she has a beautiful voice, I'm happy i was wrong 💜
Billie, you really are marvelous.
1080p in 2024 lol
I'm pretty sure the consensus from empathetic youtubers is that betterhelp is a bad company and there are better similar services available. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure several channels have dropped them. Maybe don't pick up the trash.
I really don’t get this girl. Every song she sings sounds the same.
Lovly song billie
Wow beautiful sweetheart
Every time someone subscribes, a unicorn gets its horn!
5 years and that song still hits the same. Thank you, Billie, for being part of my childhood and growing with me as I go through life.
I had to watch a 1 minute and 30 seconds ad about menopause just to watch the concert. That was abusive >:(
When vocals ruled
I always loved your music, but now I'm a huge fan!  Also, you look AMAZING.
I NEED A LOLA YOUNG TINY DESK PLEEAASSEE
no i love you😔
se puso bonita denuevo la bili antes parecia una vieja kl
feeling healed
Billie on tiny desk woww
Really need this to complete my 2024 experience. ❤
Billie you mean so much to me, thank you for this magical moment
i'm gonna cry
J’aime tellement regarder la belle Billie chanter.
Please give a like a to this comment so I always come back to this treasure, thank you!
Tiny Desk always makes me fall in love at first sight with artists I’ve never listened to or had an interest in before. Beautiful!
Catriel LA ROMPE !!!!
15:58 holy sht, bless my soul! 😭✨
Her voice is surreal
CELTIC     ROCKER.   MATTERS.   LUV U BABY.   25❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
when I went into this video I said billie please don't make me cry and 0:52 hit me 😭
che bella ragazza che e' diventata,me la ricordo a Milano prima del covid,aveva 16,17 anni ed era gia' bravissima.Per me con Adele e Amy Winehouse e' la miglior artista degli ultimi 20 anni
Crazy talent from Billie and Finneas
i don't think i could love u more
la verdad que billie eilish tiene una voz ÚNICA, es una artista totalmente poderosa y su música es increíble. gracias billie por este show es de lo mejor que he visto en años
LOVED IT but why only men for your band Billie ?🙈
11:55 I LOVE YOU TIMESTAMP
Great session, congratulations to Billie and her band.
Who is Here in 2026 ..?
I love her
John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life".
This is my first time hearing Billie Eilish sing. I like her voice!
she's literally unreal
Love how there is not any auto tune involved.
Whe need  the full desk not the tiny , this is magic To my  ears  thank you from  🇵🇹
i cant believe how good this sounds
6:40 what a smooth transition from clapping her hands and wiping off the sweat to the beat of the drummer
💚💚
I seem to be the 12, 000 comment...
props to Billie for willing to perform her hit(s)
HER VOICE IS ANGELIC. WHAT COLOR ARE BILLIE EILISH' S EYES ? I DID A PORTRAIT OF HER & I COLORED HER EYES PALE - BLUE.
She is gorgeous.
THIS is what music is all about!
She's a light. I wish she was in my life.
I cried.
Yr borther wishes he was you
This is amazing. And, we need a Finneas tiny desk too please!
Love you Billie and Finneas
Canta muito! 🎉
Lindaa! ❤😍
We don’t deserve you Billie this is so good 🥹🤍
Billie you are the most beautiful thing in this world. 🌸
This gave me chills!!!!
Angels Voice
Better then ever, the feeling and that its not studio perfect. This is how it should sound. 💙
+
Finneas go that Chad Michael Murray Christmas look goin
So amazing! We need moreeeeeee!! And Billie didn't leave something on the desk!!  😢
Nothing wrong with just being right. Tiny Desk and Billie Eilish top it all just like that...100000% respect to both.
😍😍😍
Magical
The best🎉🇺🇦❤️‍🔥
The link between Billie and Phineas is actually insane, they just sound better together 🔥😭
needed this rn, her voice is literally so healing
I already cry when i hear "I love you" but hearing it acoustic? thanks...i needed to buy new tissues anyway.
Gorgeous - music too 🙂 TTD is the benchmark...
She’s so hot
Caiu um cisco no meu olho! QUE LINDAA DIVA DEMAIS
By looking at presidents of the US - I don't believe men should really explain something
Her voice is the greatest thing happened to my ears recently
The Greatest what a song!
Imagine being young and this talented. I used to not understand the hype about her but this last album got me hooked.
They're are so talented, inspires me everyday of my life
she is an all right singer but a fake Tourette
I hate saying I like Billie Eilish, because actually I like Billie and Finneas
She’s strikingly beautiful!
🔥 ❤
Maturing like a cosmic flower
🔥 ❤
Like si solo entraste por el miau miau miau miau >.<
Real
The first song I learned on Uke was when the party’s over 😄 it was worth it
Incredibly talented duo.
Love that they finally did tiny desk after a home made one during lockdown - phenomenal artists both of them ❤
❤
Lana del Rey pls!!!!
Simple in set up, but complex in sound. This is a great acoustic set.
Just Brilliant - ❤
I have earned a newfound respect for Billie after this acoustic and raw version session🔥💗
shes actually so talented its unreal
SHE PLAYED I LOVE YOU MY LIFE IS COMPLETEEEEE COMPLETE.
thanks Tiny Desk
Why did you took down the Dominican Republic flag from the background? :C
Does anybody know the guitar model that Finneas uses on the first song? pleaase
What happens when you parent well … kids become who they truly are and how lucky are we that they decided to share with us!❤
😴
❤
Wow Better Help is awful
She’s very talented ! Wow! Amazing !
aggressive ad use :(
With difference, the best voice of her generation.
that gives me chills man thats totally awesome
Starting this video now, know I'm gonna cry like a baby... wish me luck.
An ad on every song is criminal....  WOW HER VOICE IS BEAUTIFULLLLL AND SO IS SHE!
Overrated Satanic garbage
If Billie and Willow every Collab it would def make History
god I love them so much they’re so refreshing
El hermano de Billie no puede ser mas colgado dios lo odio.
TE AMOOOO BILLIE TE AMOOOOOOO
Amazing
This young lady... wow!  I have listened to her a little but in this format, her star shines bright!
drummer been falling in love so hard 😭
I need a duet with Billie Eilish and Elmiene!
i cant stand whisper singing.
❤
This girl knows how to sing.
beautiful human, beautiful voice, beautiful voice
How can she feel shaky when she always slays with her beautiful stunning voice😊 she doesn’t know that people stay in awe listening to her music. never heard her make any mistakes xD she has a beautiful energy ❤❤❤ love her
The only thinks don’t like it for  this format is to short
She is evil.
All the Billie haters gasping and punching air right now.
I wasn’t expecting to hear I love you but I am so thankful
17:12 I saw a clip of her singing birds of a feather and it sounded baddddddd I could tell she was nervous, her voice was shaky and out of pitch
Finneas gets such a great sound out of his guitar. And his parts are just right.
Once in a lifetime an artist comes along and sets your heart on fire for music. Billie is that voice for me and I am loving the new spark in my life. Stay safe and creative so you bless more and more people xx😊
Je t'aime Billie❤
No Chihiro, no like
I was already a fan, but this made me love her even more! Great job Billie! 🫶🏾
who said the girl can´t sing?  😁
Wow, what a performance, so beautiful, tender and honest, thank you!! ♥
Как же она хороша до мурашек
no meow meow song? sad
This is up this up there with one of the best Tiny Desks. Never topping Mac Miller of course.
She’s bomb 😮
She sings like an Angel! and makes me cry so much because her songs are so much beautiful
how many times have i watched this?  yes
"But your'e so full of SHALALA"
Her voice is Amazing 🌟
Simply AMAZING!!!!
You could convince me this is a Civil Wars set.
I’ve been introduced to some of the greatest voices from Tiny Desk
incredible that you can be so popular with whispering to the mic...every average and below average can sing this
L’amour has such a warm, cheeky, Amy Winehouse vibe to it. Beautiful performances all around.
whoever wrote the description for this video about the saudade part has definitely listened to Tei Shi's music. TS explained "saudade" the same exact way
She is so incredible
que depressão... deu até uma certa angustia...  nao gostei
this is truely Brilhant. Billie & Phinneas always doing their best!
Perfecto 💛
I love you is like kokiri forest met with hallellujah
Billie have the most harmonic voice, she so magical and great, simply lovely.
Só quem e do Brasil 🇧🇷💗
No fue de los mejores performances vocales de Billie...se quedo muy corta en birds of feather (que fue la única que vine a ver)
I'm only here because of the "she knows not to dress like biggie smalls around those people" tweet
Beautiful🥰
why does she always make me wanna cry in the best way
Can we get this for like 10 hours straight ?
shes insane
Love tiny desk and Billie
Lindo demais mds, quero um show desses 😢
But how beautiful she is, God  🧸💗
i need this on spotify now!!!!!!!
Great to hear 12:10 i love you with her matured voice
🥰❤
I wish this was longer. 😩❤
I love you is one of my favorite songs.  Cool to hear it this way. Such a hauntingly beautiful song.
currently sobbing to "i love you"
quisiera que durara horas este concierto. Se me pasó de volada 😭
god is so good
MA COME CAZZO SUONA? CHI è CHE CURA IL SUONo? mio dio perfetteo.
Tan hermooosa
i haven't listened to i love you in ages and when the first few notes started playing i felt completely overwhelmed with feelings. tears running down my face before she even started singing.
can we not have the frickin adds in the middle of her singing, totally ruined by wanting to monitize this
i love u, your music 🥰💓
19:26 literally
all honesty i never really got into billie but this type of set just gave me a new type of appreciation ❤‍🔥
Billie’s voice is mesmerizing 🥰
I just came to hear: "MEAW MEAW MEAW MEAWWWW" ... but she didn't :(
L'AMOUR DE MA VIE WAS UNREALLLLLLLL
definitely very lucky to be alive to witness someone like this
14:25 drummer is doing something but its not making any noise?
Tan mágico y magnífico todo✨ pelos de punta desde el inicio
The best TINY DESK eveerrr 😍
this piano is insane
man i lover her so much, i cannot wait to finally meet her irlll
Is this the farewell show before she  moves out of the USA? BECAUSE MAGA IS BACK!!! BOOYA!
the most expected tiny desk♥
the greatest being first shes sick
Hermosa, la amo
46 year old Dad jamming out to this mini set list. You all are so incredibly talented. Jaw dropping.
te amo billie
Canta como los ángeles
Its so beautiful how Billie goes from singing and being in the moment, to smiling and laughing right after the song ends... gives us a glimpse into her pain, and into her coping mechanisms.
amazing
man, these are better than the recordings on the album!
Shoot my bad I was writing a post about Charles Bradley…sorry
I usually listen in bed laying on my side, but this is so good I had to lay on my back to hear with both ears! 😂
I just read somewhere.  He should do an acoustic album.  Unfortunately he has crossed over past on due to cancer.  The crazy thing about Charles is he was a factory worker and didn’t go full time into his music career until he was 62 years of age.  Fun facts..:)
this sucks
bestest tiny desk ever, love you billie
Wow, every time I think I have nothing left for this young lady, I hear her from a differnt angle and I'm blown away. I'm a huge Radiohead fan and her emotions within her performance remind me of what Thom can do for a song. Obviously, not close sonically, but lyrically and performatively, its similar.
mathura se hu bahut acha laga
Why am i so emotional
eu precisava demais desse tiny desk <3333
Not been following Billie's career so not super familiar with her music. However, this was extremely heart-felt and genuine. Each song was beautiful and beautifully produced. She and her brother make an awesome team. Will definitely be keeping an eye and ear on her stuff from now on. Rock on Billie, this was fire!
I cant listen to this video, as the guitarsound is 100% isolated on my right ear, completely ruining the entire video
Los Argentinos les pasmos el trapo a los ingleses, musicalmente y al futbol.
I feel transported to an other dimension in the transition of min 4:14, her voice the piano everything complements perfect and sounds amazing !
So excited to listen to this
"Wanted to do this my whole life" - Someone whose done it before
Awesome
Billie Eilish is the greatest singer in the world.😍😍😍😍😍😍
we are glad to see our superstar again
GREAT parallel!
Man I love Billie Eilish ❤
Noah Kahan in 2025 PLEASE
Open your eyes Billie. Don’t hide those emotions from us, cause they are beautiful ❤❤❤❤
You re cute billie but your band looks depressed
Lana rhoades tiny desk
como los amo gracias por tremendo espectáculo lleno mi corazón de muchas emociones que simplemente es indescriptible
🥲
Pretty bland and uninspired with way too much dragged out crooning of every other note.
Who is this?
🇱🇸🥹🙏🏽
18:30
I like the song "birds of a feather" :)) 18:29  Great video!
❤❤❤
0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Bigllie tanked
God Lord they are all astonishing, they have such deep ingrained musicality. Awesome job on the mix and sound, much chills. such perfect
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Eu jurava que finalmente teria um acústico de Wildflower no tiny desk :/
How touching is this? ❤
Goosebumps! Billie is the best thing that happened to Pop Music since Michael Jackson. 😊
This is the first time I've seen her look normal in ages. It's like she purposely creates a style for herself that makes herself look as unattractive as possible and then when you see her like this you realize how beautiful she actually is.
These raw vocals are insane. I don't think people realize how good this is. She is next level and her breath control cannot be compared to anyone ever. This is wild.
Hope she wears more this kind of outfit
I need this on Spotify STAT
Bring in Alestorm or Rammstein
Te amo billie❤
Just like in the albums.
Nelly Furtado and SWV brought me to Tiny Desk and here I am simping over Billie 😅
It just kept getting better and better. Thank you.
Beautiful.
Creo que la casa disquera hacer comercial a billie pero su estilo real es más romántico estilo carla morrison pero en calidad mejor carla
Can you sing a song in Hindi language Please try it then you are easily famous 😊
faa
EPIC
bro betterhelp has been known to be a HUGE SCAM why continue supporting this?
Ugh I'm fine with ads in general but WHY DO THEY COME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG. Anyway, even with ads this is such a cool vibe and I'm into it
OH MY
I wish you welll, in everything that you do in your life billie. You’re with me in my worse, im with you in my best
Maravilhosa!
gracie abrams in tiny desk pleaseeeeee
Billie please come to brazil
pure of the purest, love you billie.
I’m a grumpy old musician who thinks most modern pop music is trash and I am 100% on team Billie. This proves what an undeniable talent she is, and to see this flawlessly subtle performance from this wonderful band, showcasing these complex songs and her mesmerizing vocal performance. Billie and Co are the real deal. This was such a joy.
That dude at the piano is so in love with her :D
Her voice is so soothing and beautiful but also sad. If this makes sense
How tiny desk handle copyright for the artist and label?
Billie Eilish is a national treasure 🥲❤
Billie and Finneas 🥹❤️
not the betterhelp ad
is it me or do these tiny desks concerts better than anything , better then original versions, love these concerts
She reminds me of Rebecca Sugar in this
빌리야..너를우짜냐.................최고다
Jack Grealish really knows how to back up..
COME 👏🏼ON 👏🏼 BILLIE 👏🏼
she reminds  me to this laufey-girl from iceland. just with a band and a good backup-singer. ... well, and not singing exactly that good. its good music for coming from the charts i have to say. didnt expect this girl to be responsible for something you can listen to, without feeling pain like it is if i listen to coldplay or stuff.
Actually, this desk is quite big :D Love the performance!
llegas en el momento adecuado =...(
@AnamariaSayre you found such profound words to set us up for Billie's incredible performance, your voice sounds just as beautiful as hers
The drums so well played! Small symbols touches, great detail. Bravo.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What was I made for would have been a perfect add-on to this set list.
Mesmerising
Heck Billie i need you to tour again some day with Finneas so I can hear "I love you" live. Please I beg lol
Birds of A Feather in acoustic is pure gold ❤
"Saudade is a Portuguese word that can be roughly defined as a feeling of melancholy, nostalgia or yearning for something that is beloved but not present. There's no perfect translation, but one of the closest English expressions of the word I've ever seen is Billie Eilish's Tiny Desk performance."  As a Portuguese person, ever so full of saudade, I approve this message. ✔ ❤
Beautiful ❤️✨
I need birds of a feather on spotify
No I'm not in tears..
Her voice is like a warm hug
Everytime I watch Tiny Desk, I always keep looking at Mac's cap.
Oh my... anyone can be a "singer" these days...
is this what it feels like to be part of a key moment of pop culture?
This performance healed something in me
no disrespect for her usual work, but this is the first time I actually REALLY enjoy it - I guess its a matter of style.  so: full-on respect has now been acchieved and I'm a fan now :)
Don't know much of her music but dam .. that voice  is special.
😜
calm voice - good voice
Hauntingly beautiful and captivating.
I'm speechless incredible
NPR is my soundtrack. I can never donate enough.  This is the most serene....jeebus everyone there is amazing
why the guitar`s audio feels like a bit heavier to the right side? feels quite uneven tho ngl
This is just absolutely fantastic. The audio production is brilliant and their performance is amazing.
6:44 you’re welcome, enjoy
Gen Z Carpenters?
❤❤❤
This need to be my wife.. OMG! 🎉❤
18:26
This is absolutely beautiful. Her voice is soul is.
Das ist keine Live Musik oder? also Bild und Ton sind nicht eines oder? Wunderschön natürlich in jedem Fall <3
Abe ripped it on the piano.
When i realized it ended i went NOOOOOOOO!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ty Billie and band & MTD
how beautiful and pure to have a partner w music in their hands
Cann we get SZA tiny desk ?
LOVE THIS SO MUCH
First song... OMG what a beauty <3
I really thought Jesse eisenburg was playing the pillow in the background for a sec
0:32  "THE GREATEST" 6:40 "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE" 11:53 "i love you" 18:27 "BIRDS OF A FEATHER"
PAYMENT
Quelle claque, j'adore oui un album unplugged, please! Merci pour les frissons
She has a creepy brother
Lots of love for Billie ❤❤and Finneas ❤❤
ADELE
I love the way Finneas looks at her while she’s singing ❤️
oml 14:35 through 14:40 sent me to paradise they sound so indescribably comfortable with each other that it makes me feel idek what😭
Her and her brother seem like they sleep in the same bed
the RUN at 3:54 i mean that is FLAWLESS GUYS
You have nothing to fear when you have a vampire as a pianist
I don't understand how their singing is so great but so effortless. It looks like anyone could do it but when you try to do it, you fail miserably.
how the f does she do that flutter thing with her voice it seems impossible ex @9:56
The MILKERS pictorial and interview got my attention, so I came to here to hear the music.  She has a great voice and unique talent, especially with phrasing.  Anybody who is solely focused on the cans is really missing out on the music. The boyfriend does a nice job on guitar and harmonies, as well. I'm a new fan.
I love Billie. 🫶
14:37
❤❤❤❤ absolutely love this
18:32 Birds of a Feather
NPR, you guys have made some of my favorite music. From Caroline Polacheck, to Hobo Johnson, to Regina Spektor. I can't believe that you haven't had Lawrence on yet. They are in New York and are primed for your tiny desk. Their only problem is that their acusitc-ish songs are already better than any tiny desk performance could ever be. I'd still like to see what they do with it though. You've given a chance to Half Alive, Jessie Rayez, and Rye. Give me Lawrence!!!
Thats Music from the soul and from the heart. For me the best billie eilish concert. Thank you so much.
11:53 siempre regresare ahi 😿
Magnifique
She looks so good in this outfit
Is “Hallelujah” officially credited for I Love You? There’s a few lines that are almost identical.
Necesitaba esto, muchas gracias 😍
Billie has to come again❤❤❤ I haven't had enough 😢❤❤
I love u had me sobbing 😭😭
She sucks live
She sings so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
she's ridiculously talented. whoever says that pop music is dead is wrong
galing naman...super
<3
Wow, did not know how much i would enjoy this.
ICON
Wow
Billie needs to do the score for my next film
She was NOT nice to Nardwuar tho!!
💙
How is that microphone picking up all her vocals with her constantly looking away? I really want to know. I have so many mics but none work like that
DO KALI UCHIS I BEGGG
Heavenly 💕🥰
Really good
Muito bom!!!
Boring mainstream for the gullible shills.
I have a new respect for your artistry Billie. Absolutely beautiful voice, and you can tell it comes from your soul.
cringe.  disappointing that she only did her most safe "low IQ" songs.
When she sang the word“Patience❤” it was so calm!
She said my name😂❤”patience”
2 more days till her birthday ❤big 23🎉❤
How tf Youtube gonna give me an ad right in the middle of L'AMOUR DE MA VIE
Billie's voice is so beautiful.
Tqm TD para cuando Rosalía? ❤
Anyone here old enough to remember YouTube before the atrocious commercial interruptions?  Ruins the vibe on every video.
fraca...
Better Help?! Cmon NPR!
22 minutos de pura felicidad ,gracias Billie por todo este año sin dudas formaste gran parte de mi vida y saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷
Wow ❤😍🔥🫧✨⭐️
Billie brings the heavies
Billie again~ welcome~
Solo Billie podia superar el mejor tiny desk, que casualmente era de ella también ❤
love
💝💖💞
Nobody cares.. move on
Eminem...picking on such a gentle kind creature Luke bully eyelish
She's only 22 🤯. Can't wait to see her grow over the next decade.
Anyone know what kind of guitar Finneas is playing here?
the best
Is this the first repeat??
Skinny billie
Im the person living under a rock that doesnt know any of this music. A bit of a Jolie Holland vibe on the first one. Dig it.
only a fan by daughter proxy, but oh my goodness that voice.
my girlfriend loves her and this tinydesk
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Didn’t expect this
Wow! Who knew?
No talent here
Hi other Noah
This year I became a big fan of Billie, her new songs are very good and unique
THIS WAS WAY TOO SHORT I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT!!!!
Very nice. Very nice indeed.
Wow it was so wonderfull
The talent to be able to accommodate a ballad to an intimate setting and with the improvised harmonies. She's incredible!
Whats the name? 7:06
Great song list, but bass is entirely too loud.  😢
She's so incredible that even the faceless man (GoT) plays the drums for her.
Whenever shes sings the "chorus"? In "i love you" It absolutely melts me!! ❤️  And i am a guy,😮 its so amazing, its a feeling that is undescribable
Brilliant 👏👏👏🏼👏🏼🥰
she is radiating beauty in this
the voice of an angel.  I love you billie
wow this was so low key almost depressing
can we make this 2 hours instead of 22 minutes?
💚
You been selling me record when I was subscribed to premium all alone! You got me good one! Now gimme my money yer!!!! Gimme my money yer!!!! Gimme my money 😒
Thank uuu Billie and Finneas
The great thing about ignorance is you get to “discover” something like this…I’ve heard heard her name hundreds of times but never actually heard her. This was amazing
Felt like it was over before it started. A good year to go through heartbreak, thanks to Billie.
I LOVE BILLIE FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART
❤
She's trite and underwhelming. Sorry.
back here at 4am to cry on i love you
Yo! Good job!
shesagwShe is so incredible.
I LOVE it when girls’ ears stick out of their hair. And Billie can sing like that? 💓
I don’t get why she doesn’t share billing with her brother.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
'I love you' is a personal favorite, I never hear it played on the waves. Not for nothing but glad they did this rendition.
e canta né
Growing up nicely. Or a different spirit has settled in.
Talented, beautiful, period.
Tired of fiineus
Dude, Billie looking real good. That classic dark hair contrasting the healthy pale skin!
Is this not the second time Billie did tiny desk.
Brother and Sister❤ Making  wonderous beautiful music together. I miss my sister and brother so much.
The way her brother looks at her 🥰
Very good singer but music getting boring now
so simple, so beautiful
esse finneas estraga as musicas com essa voz chata😊
🥺🥺🩷🩷🩷🩷
I've never really been into Billie Eilish, but this is beyond insanely good. Straight up nasty
I need Finneas to have his own tiny desk too!!!!
such clarity is pure and just utter perfection.
6M views in 3 days. Crazy
Beautiful ❤
Devoraste reyna 💋
Tiny Desk and The Front Porch need to link up fr. 🔥
So intimate. Beautiful.
i llove u billieeeeee
love phinneas but she needs an alto backup singer for harmonies esp that last song
Does anyone else find it hard to do anything else while listening to Billie? If she comes on when I’m driving, I have to pull over and listen. I can’t even do a jigsaw puzzle and play her at the same time. It’s just sit and listen. ❤️‍🔥
Great song and music.
❤❤❤❤❤I love this so does my daughter she love it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤♥️♥️♥️♥️🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😊😊😊😊😊😊
Is anyone able to watch this without sobbing?
Que bonito canta Billie
Billy is a phenomenal singer but I can’t get behind her in supporting Kamala.
Please, bring Opeth for a Tiny Concert someday. That'd be a remarkable experience! Edit: they look so adorable, like they've just graduated from college and they are celebrating something special
Casi no me gusta la música de ella con tanto adorno electrónico pero ésta versión mas acústica me gustó y me hizo apreciar mejor su música. Definitivamente tienen que hacer un álbum acústico.
QUE GANAS DE ACOMODAR TODO EL CHIQUERO DE ATRAS DEL TINY DESK
Pura arte
begging for her to sing BLUE live 🥹
Intimacy level1000000.❤️❤️❤️ These two voices together is a spiritual experience. And the band is amazing, too: only the biggest musicians are able to play on an instrument so gently, expressively and dynamically. They recreate the moment.❤️
buttons
heavenly
The songs are beautiful, but they make me think of someone I shouldn't be thinking about.
thank you to the sound engineer who mixed the audio for giving probably the crispest vocals from Finneas all around but ESPECIALLY during Birds of a Feather
What a beautiful symphony!
I was never a billi eilish fan but this is amazing wow the emotions shes able to convey beautiful ❤️
Ads in the middle of the songs is just disrespectful… I miss it when you waited for the artists to finish
Where's the meow meow song? 😂
We need tiny desk streaming!
w
This was amazing! Next time more songs 🔥🔥🔥
Never date a girl who’s best friend is her brother
Gosh!  So beautiful!  Thank you!
SHE SUNG I LOVE YOU AHHHHHH
Love it, really wished she did “everything I wanted”
its amazing how united are Billie and Phineas. i love how Phineas look at her with admiration
I love her music!!! What a gift she and her brother are.
Her brother is an absolute star!
ok its billie on ksi's track
I must admit my knowledge of Billie’s music up to now has been very limited but this is simply beautiful. Stunning vocals, great band. This should be released on vinyl.
Beautiful
What guitar is fin playin in 1st song?🙋‍♂️
sweet 😍
I love that she said "our debut album" bc Finneas really does the MOST when it comes to producing and cowriting with Billie
Oh my God this voice... I love u!!!
I love how she said “I’m dressed like a girl” she honestly looks so pretty and her new music is amazing 💕🤌
Billie is hypnotizing
peep the caption the top bit is so real
She looks just like Claudia here
que lindeza gente
🕊️✨🙏🏼💖🤗
The run of the patience *chefs kiss*
The real deal folks. This is amazing. Real voices, real musicians, real eyebrows, keeping it real.
That was so intimate! Thank you!
I'm old, but this young woman, Billie Eilish has beautiful music. I like her. Jam On Billie.
best singer (duo) out there hands down.
❤❤
Йо а Русские Есть?
Ese sujeto wero que hace los coros deberia callarse... no canta bjen y arruino un poco lo bien que se escuchaba billie eilish
Very nice, a bit melancholic and so I wish such young people would be a bit happier.  I know that is naiv. Great music is often born in pain. But sometimes I miss that funky funkness😅 I wonder how unsecure Billie Eilish seems to be, but it makes her sympathetic and real.
chorando de tão lindo
Saudade from Portugal
15:19 Eles rindo enquanto cantam uma das músicas mais tristes que os dois já escreveram KAKAAKAKKAKA Amo os dois juntos
The caption of this video is gold. Billie and Finneas were incredible as usual!!!
What an incredible performance.
you guys don't know how much I acc love this
all the finny haters PLZ STOP!!! like if y'all know one thing about Billie she loves him, and calls him her bff.... sooo it's obvi she WANTS him there y'all so embarrassing
The desk isn't even that tiny
I really do not get it. The music is so boring
tkm Billie Eilish
@NPR invite Liniker again, please. her newest album CAJU would sounds incredible on Tiny Desk!🇧🇷
that piano is gorgeous
Diva que fala né🤌🏽❤️
(:
Please, next: AIRBAG (from argentina)
meh not even in the top 15
The Tiny Desk saca lo mejor de los artistas ❤
11:50 heard it sooooo many times, and yet, it only takes the first chord to bring tears to my eyes. I can't say it often enough, Tiny Desk is just surreal.
Thank you Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton for creating this series so many years ago. What a gift to hear these artists in such intimate settings
Nothing makes me respect an artist more than a tiny desk
heard of her of course, but never listened. that was not what I expected. very good. especially that second song
her voice is the most soulful/amazing/greatest IMO. I love the song I Love You it's one of my faves
I LOVE U 😭😭😭
I love you so much pls billie eilish look my shoort ❤❤
I love how they make all of Their songs sound just as amazing acoustic
my queen
we are SO BACK
Some artist seem to channel their craft... Billie seems to do that, astonishing
this and then tge vanity fair thing too????? are u kidding me?????
She dressing normal cause she knows who shes around. This woman can never be herself 😂
early (not)
literally love these smmmmmm
we HEREEEEEEEEEEEE
Wow 🤯
let's GOOOOOOOOOOOO
🤍
looking for Niana's comment 🧐
ohmygod
yoooooooooo
Sobbing during I love you. It’s indescribable how unbelievably beautiful this version of the song is. It goes right to the heart
What a pretty song bird
The magic from Tiny Desk concerts is unbeatable. It is a true opportunity for artist to express themselves in a unique, genuine way... Thank you !! 🤗🤗
I love you Phinneas
I still cry every time she sings I love you
Too slow. Better at 1.25
She is already GOATED as a singer
Love this girly pop
They blessed my ears
That first song broke me.
This is the Billie I vibe with💜
A @liniker deveria ter um tiny desk tbm
Maravillosa!!!❤❤❤
Siempre me haces llorar Billie te amo 😭
Shout out to the audio engineer, wonderful.
Really good but my god the guitar playing on The Greatest, horrific
💙👁
Nah the betterhelp sponsorship, fr?
I love Tiny Desk. In my opinion if you made it to TD then it's actually better than receiving a Grammy. TD is so comforting and real, and down to earth. I'd love to be on Tiny Desk. They have the most underrated artist that are endearing.
Wow, someone's coming of age ...glorious songwriting from that duo!!
Her voice is amazing
Her voice is angelic! I hope someday I could rap or sing with her!
Honestly I still hate modern music and all of the pop stars that propergate generic music, but I appreciate when artists do these smaller "acoustic" sessions, because it shows that they usually do have some musical talent. Shame they rarely put out acoustic albums
I just became a fan of Billie Eilish because of this concert video, I am very impressed and delighted to listen to her.
I can’t claim to know her music intimately but this is pretty special, I’ll pay more attention from now on. And the sound is great, really great, that snare sound! 👌🏼
bro Billie and Finneas has always been the absolute best during their acoustic performances. even since her debut album. smashed it
Muero por algún día escucharte en vivo Billie 🥹✨
And just like that I need to change my top ten again for Tiny desk concerts
😍😍😍
I had never heard this girl, and now I am so in love with her music. She has something special in her voice and her look, it how if she had a pain in her soul and she wanted to heal it through her music, simply beautiful and charming. Love from México  💞🔥⭐
🩵😄
😭😭😭
the note change in i love you had me SOBBING.
ive ever been so in love with someone ive never had a conversation with 😪
Her voice is so beautiful
Lynch me, but it's boring af
Can't wait to see Billie live next year - will be the second time I've seen her - I can't wait to hear her belt out the greatest and birds of a feather
А я не знал, что Поперечный за гитарой будет.
THE FACT SHE PERFORMED "I LOVE YOU" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Estoy tan enamorada de Finneas y él sin saberlo 😅😂❤😊
Please record an album with this vibe! Yeeeeeeeep! ❤❤❤
I think she was incredibly nervous for sure because she hardly spoke whereas many other artists engage with/speak to the audience quite a bit.  Funny that she said she dressed as a girl that day when there was nothing girlie or even girl like about her outfit other than that she was wearing a skirt!!!
listening to them is like miracle to my ears! when they sing acoustic the are the best! love billie and finneas!!!!!!!1
Ivan cornjeo
Love it
Ariana Grande next, please!
Anyone identify the black guitar Finness plays?
🎶🥰✨
Shame on you for working with BetterHelp. Their shady exploitative practices have been publicly known for many years now--selling their users' private health data to advertisers, not vetting their therapists' credentials, and more. Look into the FTC ruling against them and please reconsider accepting their money. They are exploitative grifters exploiting particularly vulnerable people. I expected better from NPR, of all outlets. Billie sounds great, but this sponsorship soured the whole video.
This version of the greatest is so freaking beautiful
El video dura 24hrs ❤❤❤😂😂😂
this is when i lerned i like billie's music
I like this girl
Sing doch mal was Heilsames .
She’s just better when she belts out a tune instead of whispering.
Literal chills the entire 22 minutes, HOW does someone’s voice do that?!
Billie. Is a dude.
billie always sounds so beautiful ❤️
She looks great.  Finneas using the dedicated rubber bridge guitar, prettyy coool
i love you was one of our favorite songs with my best friend. lost him in the past year and listening to this concert i never thought she’d sing this. i listened the new album alone and never listened the old songs since that accident cause it was so hard. now hearing i love you was so painful yet so heartwarming. it was like he was here with me reminding me all the times we listened it together. and making fun of me for crying to a song. i miss you canimk🤍  and i love you forever and always
6:45 that guitar part is sounding a little Mayer-esque and I love it
Can y’all get Dominic file on a tiny desk please
I'm completely addicted
This stuff makes me cry
I want them to give a tour of the shelf. The amount of legends it must carry :0
After Ca7rel y Paco Amoroso, everything is so bored
I am crying so much listening to this one, the emotional energy she gives me is unmatched. Wow, love it!
ty for this. made my day
i've waited for this session for a long time.
Raw jam sessions where we can hear the artist’s voice as if we were in the room are the best
Simply amazing. I am without words for how talented they both are. Such a lovely listen.
whew, ‘i love you’ always hits.. that first verse where she says “it’s not true, tell me i’ve been lied to. crying isn’t like you” it takes me back to the morning my dad had seen i was awake, and told me my only brother had passed. I seen him crying and thought to myself, man my dad never cries.. what’s going on. and was hoping he’d tell me my brother was in the hospital or something, anything but what had actually happened. hard to believe it’s been 5 years.. 143 brother 💚
Im waiting to you bring twenty one pilots
Shout out to SOLO🗣🥰!!!
sans défaut!
My ex is going to Love this tiny desk. I wish I could watch it with her.... If you're watching this Mary, I love and miss you. Love always, Nate.
I just love how naturally beautiful she is. Her voice, her look, her personality, her aura and her relationship with Finneas.
Enjoyed this so much
one of the coolest girls alive
Not me crying in the 0 second of I Love You
❤❤
wasn't better help a well known scam?
Keep it up guys...these sessions also works while studying long hours
4:15 😭😭😭
Are we in heaven? Because this is so pure and beautiful
I’ve never heard the first song before and I started crying within 2 seconds of her singing. POWERFUL
Excelente todo, pero no era que se hacia en usa sola toma???? Como en el minuto 12:00 hubo un corte
She’s not that great in acoustic tbh, yall just glazin her in the comments
Love Tiny Desks! This one was special, such beautiful voices. How he reaches out to his Sister to comfort her is so sweet.... Blessings to these Sibs...
Better help is being sued for selling their patients information to Facebook pls stop advertisement for them! Also also I love this tiny desk smmmmm billie is everything
this version of BOAF feels so refreshing
Not even a good voice   Birds of a feather is #1??? How? Why? Where?
Chick has some serious dead ends
lol @ 15:20. Those silly moments between these two always make me chuckle and appreciate the fact they don’t take themselves too seriously all the time
I can’t believe we’re getting her Tiny Desk in 2024! Feels kinda late tbh but I’m stoked
❤❤❤❤
Never really got the hype around Billie until watching this thanks Tiny Desk
Billie is a gift from heaven.
crazy phazes of the human state🤔
this drummer is my favorite guy he's so into it
to start off with The Greatest is criminal (sobbing)
all i have to say is DEAR GODDD
Definitivamente Billie Eilish es la artista con la que más me identifico ❤ te amo mucho billie.
solo queria escuchar el miau miau miau miau y no lo hizo : )
love them sm i cant   this is so beautiful. Wonderful pure talent and connection with making music
WHOW!!!
I'm an old man just turned 69 and let me tell you this is wonderful music it moves me. You all keep being you and I'll keep listening❤ looking forward to everything you do😊
I love how finenas is always with her it’s so cute. Love their relationship
Wildflower???
who else was waiting for WILDFLOWER 😢
A voz da Billie é a melhor coisa de ouvir, minha nossa.
that is good, but the greatest ''The Greatest'' song is yet Cat Power's one.
this is perfect. NPR, please consider 4K streaming.
She's looking great.
Wow
Never identified as a Billie fan but this has changed that SO FAST
WHY IS THIS VIDEO 49 HOURS LONG??????
THAT MIC WAS ONNNN
listening to her music and watching her on any platform after seeing her in person feels so different I wanna cry every time now 😣❤️
Beautiful good job Billie 4:33
We need a sticky fingers tiny desk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤pleaseeeeww
~~ 11:52
linda maravilhosa minha deusa
proud to be a top 0.5% fan in 2024 😜
It really must be Saudade, as I'm coming back every day. Or maybe it's just because I'm Portuguese.
Doesn't it sound like a mix of Norah Jones and Adele somehow?
Beautiful ❤
Num entendi nada mas o show do caralho.SHOWZASSO.
Come and follow me
Boring.
How did everyone not fall asleep? 😂
My attention span just increased enormeously.
HOW ABOUT  FULL ALBUM OMG :((( SO SAD
\\big radiohead influence
im obsessed with her 😭
I can not get enough of this wow
They are both so FINEEEE
Finneas the man you are
If we have to have adverts surely not in the middle of a song!
officially boycotting doordash for interrupting l’amour de ma vie
the advertisement killed me -.-
hoooo billie ❣🥺
i really love you billie
Over 5 Mil views in 3 days!  WOW
one of the worst Tiny Desk ever. They didn't prepare anything. The band seems bored. They don't offer anything new.
I LOVE YOOUUU🤭
lamore de ma vie sounds laufey influenced almost
so when is phineas gonna do a solo album
Beautiful opening song🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💞
That first tune was magical. Thank you for touching my soul. Music is life. Stay blessed, Billie. You are a beautiful gift for us all.
Her live voice is so soft and beautiful
Birds of the feather is me and my wife fav song 🌹 Thanks to bille for creating that masterpiece. It brought us together when we were facing one our hardest moments this year . I can hear that song on repeat 🔁
voice from heaven
I'm 50 years and absolutely love this beautiful Songbird. Continue to use the blessings that God has bestowed upon you.  Beautiful music transcends over space and time.
"I love you" is a gem 💎🥹
What a shame and huge mistake having such a scummy and diabolical company as Better Help sponsor an megastar with the pull like Billie Eilish.   Please do your research NPR. it’s no secret that better help literally employs non mental health professionals and that they ask their “customers” to do their research before using their service.  Stay safe out there folks and if you struggle with mental health, there is better help then “better help”

Not my type of music. But … I listened to the whole performance with great admiration.  Real live music. Real instruments. No female singer in much revealing clothes resembling bathing suits. No “auto tuned” vocals. No miming. No pitch correction afterwards, no ... I am glad that real music is still being made by musicians who could be my grandchildren - no, not in terms of talent, in terms of age ...
its imposibble not to fall in love with billie 🤍🤍
Love this version of her..
MAN I LOVE BILLIE AND FINEAS
She's mid
This song with her and her brother gives me 2024 carpenters
❤❤❤❤❤
respect gained
we need a wicked tiny desk concert with both arianna and cynthia
imagine having “i love you” written about you
Does the brother gaze at her in some sort of creepy weird way...or is that just me...hmm
This was sweet.
0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Russian mic do this sound 🤌
Thank you tiny desk...❤
This is music… not APT…
She sounds terrible without a computer to "fix" her voice.
Amazing gift to us- the fans ❤
So cool
The first song is magical, i dont know the tittle is , im not a fan , insane.
Tiny Desk might just be one of the greatest performances settings (much like the old Austin City Limits shows). It looks like Billie Eilish has finally made it big
At least put the ads between the songs don’t interrupt it with an ad 🤬
Crazy how people think she's just an artist for tasteless 14 year old girls. So talented.
I needed this! Thank you NPR Music😭
That sad sap is smiling?who woulda thought
Carpenters  pt.3
she's amazing
billie's voice 😢💖
I didn't noticed how great is the greatest before this tiny desk concert , listened to your album after it and I love it 💙
What an amazing voice you have there dear sweetheart Billy <3
What a lovely moment ❤
so vintage- so modern!! SO DREAMY!!!
Thank you @tinydesk for this Christmas gift
💙
como que 16
❤❤❤❤
That is Thom Yorke in Billie's skin.
So special
i hate you for making me cry this morning billie 😭 i love you is hitting different with my current situation i have going on.
i hate you for making me cry this morning billie 😭 i love you is hitting different with my current situation i have going on.
Magic.  Balm for the brain.
Love me some Billie 🥰🥰
God has blessed these 2 siblings with a great connection!
That was awesome!
Her voice is so magical
So beautiful as usual
I thought the desk would be tinier
Billie acoustic  just perfect  love you
what a amazing performance,love this sm🫶🏼
She’s so bland
wow, bringing out KSI as a special guest was a real surprise - great job everyone
Yikes
Love them ❤
İ love there old songs😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
She is so beautiful here❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A Billie Tiny Desk 🥹🥹🥹🥹
omg she sang i love u!
I hope she performs the entire lamous de ma vie song. It’s my favorite of hers.
Huge artists are doing tiny desks..
BILLIE TE AMOOO😭❤️❤️
Mi niña hermosa, la sentí ella misma y en toda la gira no la veía así de tranquila disfrutando el momento
5.555 Million 😊 2 Days😮
This is so beautiful 🥹
FU BETTER HELP
From an old man perspective. That was very entertaining, and they are all truly special musicians.
PLEASE DO BAEBADOOBEE
<3
There is a harmony that only siblings can achieve and it always gives me goosebumps.
no wildflower???????????????
As a musician, it must be so stressful to have played this one. Although, rather easy to play these tracks. The smallest wrong doing becomes flagrantly noticed. Yet, the beauty of mastering simplicity becomes magnificent.  Love all i hear from the 2 fronts. Then this voice!
So perfect 🥺
🙇‍♂️
I love it ❤❤❤❤
The video we all attend for
🥰
Wasn’t expecting to be crying at 8 am this morning but here we are. What a beautiful human with such a beautiful voice
fk ad
Punish me please
That was incredibly moving.
Billie seems so uncomfortable with what shes wearing. She keeps tugging and smoothing her clothes. I hope her clothing was her choice and not someone elses to get her to appeal to the masses.
👏🏽👏🏽❤️💔
I feel L'amour De Ma Vie could be a song by The Strokes. It actually reminds me a lot of a song by Little Joy (th band Fab Moretti started with Rodrigo Amarante) called Shoulder to Shoulder.
Billy and finneas  following doechii be like rolling stones following james brown that one time.. xD
Deus abençoe
She's a genius with an angel voice
Amazing!!!
THATS THAT BLOOD HARMONY
I wish she and Radiohead could play together. I would 100% be at that concert
The changing of guitars inbetween songs, Finneas is so talented 🥺 . Billy sounds like an angel , I can’t get over this performance. Thank you Tiny desk ❤️
Lovely ❤ and lucky b4st4rds that were there live hahaha ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rich the kid on Tiny Desk please🙏🏽🙏🏽
I love you must be one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Can't get enough of it every time I listen to it. Beautiful and heartbreaking equally ❤
Okay, I guess I need to give Billie a try.
She is the best singer ever… so difficult songs… absolutely perfect execution
my ears are blessed
BRUNO MARS PLSSSSS LEGGOOOO HOOLIGANS IN ACOUSTIC!!!!
The amount of freshness she brings trough her music is unmatched
fantastic voice, such a pleasure to hear her songs. thank u the tiny desks!
No fancy clothes or accessories just pure talent. Billie and Finneas are truly gift for this music industry ❤
am i still a man if her voice makes me cry?
Tiny Desk Concert is the only way I could hear these type of artists 😅.
She's a treasure in this world.
when will a duet or trio with bill frisell come?
빌리보러 온 한국인들 모여볼까요?
❤Cool!
She’s looking swell and they played beautifully ❤
simply amazing
love you. Thank you for existing 🥰. You have an amazing voice. Keep doing good. Blessings and success from the bottom of my heart ❤
I like how the band are dressed up for a day at the office ,,   These two are something special 🔥
The harmonies of these two oh man. This music is a remedy for everything one human being may be going through..
Is the bassist player are the same one who played guitar for Mac Miller?
I don’t understand the appeal of todays music. I find it all absolutely atrocious.
Hold up that the same fit the girl in the visualizer for KSIs song, Dirty was wearing. It was definitely Billy
what kind of mic is that?
This is real quality. Wonderful concert.
She’s incredible
Feeling blessed 😊 Thank you to everyone who made this exprience happen 💛
the part where she says "like dying" just scratches my brain
What amazes me is how the big brother looks up to his little sister. The trust and bond they share are truly mesmerizing to witness.
I do not have any words of praise because this is so heavenly that I don't think any words would suffice.  What a beautiful time!  💙🧡💙🧡
If you’re here, you have a beautiful soul. Don’t stop believing in yourself. You are kind, you are smart, you are important.
This should be illegal. You shouldn't be allowed to have that face and that voice at the same time. It's so unfair for us mortals
the way finneas looks at here during Ily
I hope it's on Spotify soon for L'amour de ma vie
You make me listen to music the way I used to. Not to block out something, but just to enjoy listening to melodies and harmonies and get lost in them in a way that achieves what the former is supposed to in a healthier, more desirable way.  I love your music so much.  💚💙💚💙
Ive heard about her for years, never listened,  its just kids making fuss of another new act. The old man put some headphones on and listened.   Thats a ridiculous talent to have a voice sit like that through every melody, timing and bring emotion.
I about freaked out when I saw Billie finally on Tiny Desk!!! Thank you 🙏🏽!!!
I can't afford to attend concerts. This is the next best thing, if not, the BEST thing to ever exist. Thank you!!
❤❤❤
I’m getting twilight feels
Honey, you're the greatest.  God, thank you for embracing music, and putting out an album that makes me hold my breath.  🖤🤍🖤🤍
Stunning, her voice just amazing!!!
MAN I REALLY LOVE THIS BILLIE OUTFIT
❤love you  Ojai
beautiful voice😊
She seems very anxious
please bring beabadoobee here againnn!!
I am so glad I found this channel! When I was young, I studied journalism in Washington, D.C., and NPR became part of my daily routine—a gateway to understanding the depth and art of great radio. Back in the early 2000s, I regularly listened to *All Songs Considered* and *World Cafe* . These programs introduced me to new music and offered intimate, authentic glimpses into artists' stories and performances. Little did I know that these elements would evolve into what we now cherish as the Tiny Desk Concerts.  Now, years later, I’ve embarked on a new journey—learning to sing. I came to this channel looking for a unique recording of Billie Eilish, hoping to find something raw and natural to sing along with in my own process of learning a cappella. What I found was far more than just a performance—it was a gateway to understanding music and voices on a deeper level. The Tiny Desk has become an essential hub for me as a singer-in-training, allowing me to connect with each artist’s voice in a way I haven’t experienced anywhere else.  Hearing Billie Eilish’s Tiny Desk performance, produced with such care and precision by Josh Rogosin, felt like stepping into the music itself. It’s not just a recording—it’s an intimate experience where every voice, every sound, and every nuance feels alive and personal. This artistry makes Tiny Desk performances so unique, and it’s why I keep coming back.  Tiny Desk isn’t just a platform for music; it’s a masterclass in capturing authenticity and storytelling through sound. Listening to these performances helps me feel more connected to the artists I admire, and it inspires me to push myself further in my own singing journey. This channel has rekindled the same joy and appreciation I felt when I first fell in love with NPR all those years ago.  Thank you, NPR Music and the Tiny Desk team, for creating something truly timeless. And thank you, Billie Eilish and Josh, for bringing such incredible art to life. Tiny Desk continues to be a space where music, sound, and emotion come together in the most beautiful way.  With immense gratitude,   Christopher
Saudade😌Billie Irish's live always moves my heart💓🥺Ahh💓Thank-you😌💓Tiny Desk's live is sooooo good!👍✨
Her voice has gotten so much better and I’m so glad she performed I love you one of my faves from When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go
This is the best balance of their voices I've heard. Normally Finneas is mixed super low, and you miss how beautiful the harmonies are and how well their voices blend.
La wea fome, que desperdicio de canciones cantadas de esa forma 🇨🇱
Love seeing Billie grow as an artist from When we all fall asleep to now it’s truly amazing seeing his dad she’s grown
I need all fo this on spotify pleaseeee
pls put tiny desk concert on Spotify!! I love it all!
Imagine Mac n Billy making a song/Album?..... Jesus
I have been waiting for it. Thanks
Woke up this beautiful sunday morning in Durban, South Africa and boom I see this posted 2 days ago, I GO CRAAAAZY !!!!  Rolled up, got out to the veranda with a sip, sparked up and played❤❤❤ i love how they both laughed mid song with bro (inside joke) but still resumed singing
Not gonna lie...you get excited seeing a name like this pop up on the Tiny Desk uploads.  POV: You're familiar with some of the work and immediately intrigued by the setting in which this particular stage presents the sound and vocal talent of such an artist.  With much respect to the sound engineers, with no small task of getting it right, yet again it's a grand slam at the bottom of the ninth.  Outstanding performance from all.
FINALLY!!! I remember the Tiny Desk they did during COVID and now they’re actually at the venue!!
She likes that chair.
Fell asleep, good cradling stuff
Humilde o irmão dela por não colocar seu nome em destaque, embora ele tenha grande participação no começo de todo projeto 🙋🏻‍♂️😅
I love youuuuuuu <3
Nooo wayyyy:] this is gonna be great
🎉
All songs are mesmerizing works of art. Billie's unique, whispery vocals create an intimate atmosphere. She is absolutely amazing! Congratulations to all the musicians!
13:54 you can see the pain in her eyes :/
damien rice vibe of the gloomy day
one day i’ll be doing a tiny desk concert 🤞🏽
It’s aiight
와 빌리 라이브 너무 좋아 역시 믿고 듣는 빌리❤ 이렇게 라이브 할때마다 애드립 해주는거 극락이다 사랑해 빌리❤
살 ㅈㄴ 뺏네
Is it me or Finneas guitar doesn't match the audio during the beginning of L'AMOUR DE MA VIE?
when are these coming to streaming platforms
Disappointing Trump is going to dismantle NPR, this could be the last.of it 😢
That guitar riff really pulls 'birds of a feather' in a lovely Kris Kristofferson-ish feel.  The song feels like sunshine through rain.
never clicked so fast!
I thought she left USA? Wasn't she one of the lot that said if Trump is voted in she's leaving USA for good along with degenerats
Can not wait to see you next year in Berlin <3
This is a must watch❤❤
🤯🤯🤯
Her songs are straight terrible awful & this concerts sucks 😂😂😂
Why people keep putting fake claps and laughs…
Escuché la primera canción, ahora sigo ,pero es como Gardel,cada día canta mejor!😅
Cámara, luego ensayan.
Nice voice but soooo boring
this is why she’s so famous
I guess I'm in love with Billy Eilish now. What a beautiful set.
i would give up my house to get this recording on vynle rnnn
shes so pretty and she lloks so healthy! i love this natural color of hair on her
Billie and Finnes i love u guys both sm litteraly am cryng i love u guys sm❤❤❤❤
Sobrevalorada. Solo tiene una canción buena.
You guys have no idea how the chills felt when she started singing.. or maybe you do.
who thought the drummer and pianist were brothers?
She is awful.  Just god awful.
That was incredible! Bravo
I love everything these two do, but that was the worst vocals I’ve heard from either of them to date. Intonation and breath control not on point. That must be a rough tour. Still love you guys, but I’m sure you don’t love your vocals on this one.
❤
zzzzzzzzzzzz
Thank you for keeping me company while I struggle to study for my math final <3
Bbg what happened to your arm
I love her and her brother truly and see her true talent but she is just one those times I just don't feel it with an artist I am told I should like. I feel it everywhere else with her except for the music. She is so funny and clever, witty, one of those people you know you can trust. I enjoy watching her on talk shows, the little nice things she does for people, her instagram when covid first hit was amazing comfort when it was so weird. I want to love her music but it never hits me, except for maybe bad guy.
I clapped at them like I was there. The acoustic versions are FANTASIC.
台灣那些最紅、最Top的年輕歌手，有哪個可以唱到這樣？有哪個有這般才華？沒有！一個都沒有！
I‘m not a fan of every song they write, but when somebody else tries to cover their songs it is usually not as good and I get and appreciate them even more. This here is a treat ❤ Thank you!
i LOVE IT😭🫶🏻 AA BILLIEEE🖤
hot taske...shes good but your local girl who can sing can do the same thing. theres a reason why all she keeps her voice so low.. but she does have great control
Phineas and Billie Eilish O' conner   And the band 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤
I know she is famous,  both are good (brother and her) , but there are infinite artists (not famous ) with more artistry. She also should recognize her brother more, the song arrangements are key is her music. Anyways,  it's all good, we got to be ready to be at the right place at the right time too. ✌️
love you billie ♥
<3
Are we being punk’d with sibling attraction at this point? Geez 😅
"i love u" es y sera siempre mi cancion favorita de Billie. Es dificil de explicar todo lo que me hace sentir.
Es lo más hermoso que he escuchado dios mio que voz que percusiones música de verdad
Wanted to listen on my way to work started sobbing on the first song. You  got a way with people. Goes without saying I prefer the live acoustic version.
Came for Doechii’s tiny desk but now stuck here. She’s impressive live but still blown by Doechii’s performance 😍
Definitely not for me. God, this was so boring. I'll never get it.
18:30 todo por ese minuto 😅😢
finally❤
I literally started crying on ily .
Your voice hypnotizes me
I need away from the concrete my feet are split
Billllllliiiiiieeeeee ❤❤❤❤❤❤ I’m gonna cuddle with you and look at the stars by a waterfall
Finneas’ mic was OWWWWWNNNNNNNNN
This is a pure PR project
좋다 알럽
betterhelp? seriously?
Good?

haayssxzz😢😢😢 ILY!!!!!!!!
The absolute frisson from all of this 🥹
this is so magical. ♡
Te amo mucho billie
Spectacular!!!! You and Finneas are incredible!!! 💙
Awesome ❤
first song was fire
Lola young would be amazing
The two most talented people in the music industry! I could listen to Billie and Finneas all the time, especially intimate settings like this❤️
Tão lindo o Finneas admirando ela!  😍
I love Billie and Finneas!! 🎉❤❤❤
Ual 😮...
I love Billie and Finneas!! 🎉❤❤❤
Niki was there, also.
Music in its pure state
❤❤
Billie’s voice has matured soooo much. She has absolutely come into her own. Her skill is getting more and more impressive everyday!!!
WOW
❤amo
It honestly warms my heart a little when Billie loses her nerve. As someone who has loved to sing more than anything her entire life, but had terrible stage freight, I relate so hard. I'm 41 but I'm not giving up! I want to share my gift because it makes my heart so full. Thanks for the inspiration 🫶
umm...beautiful. that's all I have to say.
D de
God, her voice penetrates my soul.
🎧🎶🎧🎶🎧
I’d love her more if she didn’t dis normal looking men. She ain’ all dat huself. 🙄
💙💙💙💙
Mitski
💖
le falta gore
billy needs to replace mariah carey with a new christmas album
I can't stand democrats.
Holy F@)$ my heart 😮
flawless 😍
I'm so envious of the people who got to hear her in that setting.
having us**
You guys have got to stop supporting BetterHelp. They sell people info.
I was listening this in a parked car, as rain was falling, watching the rain drops on the windshield reflecting and sparkling blue from the interior lights. I had a spiritual experience yall.
Enchanting ❤
Mid af
I HAVE NO WORDS ❤🙏🏾😍🙆🏾‍♀🥹
So much talent it’s hard to comprehend
god her vocal technique is enough to leave u speechless. nevermind the SOUL and feel she has for music :) thanks npr!
HURTS SO GOOD.
The way he looks at his sister......creepy.
I need Young Miko on Tiny Desk in 2025 plsss

GONNA CRY I HAVE BEEN DREAMING AND LONG AWAITING THIS DAY. T.T BILLIE AND FINNEAS ARE MY WHOLE WORLD
Why are a lot of yours sessions blocked for Venezuela ??
Amazing ♥️🇵🇪
t amo billie
She sings like she’s 30
Ngl this sounded kinda lame compared to normal shows
The sound engineer need a rise. Always perfect
This is pretty killer.
Billie looks slim here, she's so pretty.
Commercials in the middle of a song make me not buy their products! Guess I’m never going to own a Cadillac
I LOVE YOU ALWAYS HITS 😭
No wrong with you dressing like a girl, We Love you just the way you are❤❤❤❤❤
Guys I love you is at 12:20
18:29 She´s so Beautiful...
she needs to bring back the clasics like when the party is over and the green hair
william was incredible as always -- separately .... the amount of ad breaks youtube puts into a 20 minute video is appalling
Wonderful performances of boring songs.
Your music is my safe place...🍃🫰🏾🩷
i’m gonna go girl today is so real coming from an androgynous human myself
i love you.
The Tiny Desks are becoming the new MTV Unplugged
Too short, I didn't feel the time flowing with this TDC. Really beautiful. And she is incredible!
Crying 😢
Bello como todo lo que hace!💖✨
increíble!
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹

South Koreans toppled a dictatorship and now we hear billie again
Could there be a voice more perfect?
She is so adorable
Her voice is so soothing. It definitely won’t be my first time here😂❤️
Jesus Christ billie you ate that up!!
One of the few things America did great in the past 30 years in music.
forever obsessed
18:10 Birds of a feather
Diva querida 💙
On core ?
she looks and sounds absolutely angelic per usual wow
The Greatest 0:22  L’Amour De Ma Vie 6:44 I love you 11:53 Birds of a Feather 18:28
What a beautiful voice ❤
has she ever spoken on it being emotionally difficult to sing the greatest or i love you? the songs are so impactful i cant imagine them being enjoyable to perform...
This video boosted my mood so much. Thank you Billie and Finnneas. I needed your soothing music very badly haha.
the three other guys have the same hair at varying levels of curl
her voice ... *melted
MY BROTHER LIKED VERY MUCH🤗🤗🤗
COOL!!!😍😍🤩🥳⭐️💗💘🐐
i would love if the drummer was shaking an eggplant at 15:15... but not as much as i love this.
I needed this. What a heart. Thank you ❤
tears
I could listen to her in this setting with this sound all day ❤
the piano usage in these versions is absolutely phenomenal.
She’s mad because Kamala lost
THIS is how an audience is supposed to act. Take notes everyone.
Ayooo Billies tiny desk is here
alanis, is that you?
❤❤❤❤
This may be my favorite behind the Mac Miller tiny desk
❤❤❤
robbed of album of the year. what a beautiful performance.
all she does is moan when she sings
bbk ya fnanah
Aesthetically, less is always more with this beautiful artist.
BOOOOOOO Betterhelp doesn’t help people.   Bad sponsor!   Reconsider your sponsorship deal with them.
dios billie disfruto tanto de tu musica te amo
very glad I listened to hit me hard and soft this year. I never have usually listened to her music but I very much enjoyed the album and I will continue to go back to it. thanks billie eilish
Now I’m crying at work . I didn’t expect to hear “I love you”
Birds of a feather was off or im tripping . Sounded so weird . Maybe the nerves
Just crying at how beautiful this sounds 🎶🥹✨
I wish rosē perform here
Her voice just gets better and better doesn’t it. Billie keeps growing as an artist and it’s amazing to watch. I love you was such a great surprise. To hear how the delivery has changed is really incredible
Pure amazing
Some of the ads are in the middle of songs. Could you move them so they are in between songs instead? Thanks
Knocked loose next?
My lord!  She is so talented!
Turns out the world is made up of a lot of people who just want to be seen
i cant wait to watch this..but im saving itt
absolutely beautiful
Que espetáculo 🥹🥹🥹
Ta amo❤
Every body have a love of the life?🤔
Duh 8:30 the most incredible 🔥
Love it thanks bunches
NPR please somehow try to make a Billie x Florence and the Machine collab happen or anyone that reads this that knows how that could be a possibility
FOR FREE???
the first song goes into a wild time signature for a minute
SOOO GOOOOOOOOD
Tqm Billy amo tu música ❤
Her voice is so perfect it’s like it’s not even real ❤
te amo
Dang we got what we didn't know we.needed!
absolute perfection 🥺✨
que gran cantante es Billie Eilish aunque sus canciones son muy dramáticas
the title should be billie eillish & Finneas.
I LOVE U SO MUCH BILLIE YOU MADE ME CRY I TRULY LOVE YOU TILL THE DAY THAT I D1E <'3
@11:22 ❤, @18:20
La manera en la que Finneas mira a Billie, es tan dulce 😭
this is one of the best performances of them both I'm in love
most boring  music performance i´ve seen in my life
Billie and her brother remind me of The Carpenters🥹
Kamala lost......Jesus is Lord
Im crying I love them so much
BILLIE !!!!!!!! : )
I love Billie so freakin much.  If she DOES do an acoustic album, she has got to keep the strings pleeease, because only having the keys wasn’t flowing as great
Although I have been hearing Billie Eilish's name more and more recently, this is the first time I have had occasion to watch and listen. This 70 years young music fan thanks the Morning Brew for sharing the link that changed that! Delightful!
YT algorithm has to be better. How’d it take me 2 days to see this
billie's voice is so therapeutic
Love Billie but i want to hear her voice not that guy
Very Nice 👏🏽👏🏽
Love this series! I‘d be dying to see Hozier again at Tiny Desk Concert! 🥹
😍🖤
💙💙💙💙
Unreal
I had the honor of seeing Billie for the first time at outsidelands. I had no idea who she was. But I still remember the talent and voice she demonstrated. Took me by total surprise because I don’t listen to this sort of music. I’m a hard rock, generally rock guy. Haven’t heard her since and once again, I’m really digging it.
Sono esterrefatto, ma non avevo dubbi. Billie e Finneas siete una certezza. Grazie per questi momenti di vera musica.
I love you billie❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Babbyyy at this point, TINY DESK IS EPIC‼️🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾Love this🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
12:00
My oh my, wow. 65 years' old and blown away.
Pls show her where need to sing, i dont hear nothing
tiny desk has been killing it
💕🌸
❤❤❤
12:00
6:30
The sound is soooo good THANK👏 YOU 👏
Better help isn’t hippa compliant and sells your data NPR TINY DESK  you shouldn’t be promoting that
ok angel
Realmente se fosse pensar em uma palavra em português para definir Billie Eilish, "saudade", acho que faz sentido.
Just got a commercial for beast Games. YIKES NO THANKS.  LOVE YOU BILLIE
Wow!
Sweet, Sweet, Sweet!
I wonder newcomers like Dea Matrona or Mary Spender might get on in this format.
yoo much ads
Birds of a Feather should be a much slower, quieter song. Look up Frank Watkinson's version... Sooooo much better.
This girl is incredible.
13:05 hallelujah
we need Miley Cyrus here!!!!!!!!!!!! billie rocks! she is on fire
There's a meme here of "I want someone to look at me the way Billy Eilish's brother looks at her".
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. Only because I don't have the words to put it any other way.
the pianist is in love with her and so am i
Muy cambiada la Nicky Nicole.
💔
Best one of my kids are right. I do love them
Just beautiful.  <3
KEEEE WATAFAK
OMG love her voice and LOVE this tiny desk setup
Her adlibs are 👩‍🍳💋
This is how you end the year tiny desk!
Ad mid song 🙄
Te amo billie eilishpor ti le echo gana ala vida
What's the craic with all the band having shirt and tie? Brother aside
Natalie Merchant, Alicia Keys, Dua Lipa, and Dolores O'Riordan, there is a new Queen of Tiny Desk - Billie Eilish!
I want to find out the name of this first song... It's great !
Thank you!!!  I listened to her live three days ago in San Jose, CA Speechless ❤
Her vocals are crazy. She is talented but she makes the type of music that people cut themselves to or when they sacrifice themselves in self-immolation.
I am so moved of her songs. A life picture of emotions we both maybe be experienced for past 21:18  decades and decades. Thanks Tiny Table brings Billie and Finneas here.
i will always love billie
Acá el ejemplo de un buen tiny desk, no como la porquería esa de maluma.
If this doesn't build a bridge between "music isn't what it used to be"-people and today's music, I don't know what ever could.
0:21 * The greatest.  6:42 * l'amour de ma vie. 11:51 * I love you.  18:26 * Birds of a feather.
Why does her band look like the school of rock kids
wonderful!! Anyone able to pick up what vocal mic she's using?
💙
La que puede, puede.
Tiny desk 👍
bacı sen naptın
She is fantastic
What a star❤
this is beautiful
Aquí demuestra que es una más que sin Auto-Tune no es nada
Very good indeed!
We need bahamas on tiny desk.
ever to even 😞
Tiny Desk Billie hits different. 👌🏽💙☕️
I really really wanna see Lana Del Rey
Crying because I was 12 when i love you came out and now im 17
How are they going to put adds on a tiny desk 🙄
Billy, people that are raised without a loving spirit dont know the language of love. if you invest pure love little by little  they will get to know the difference. setting healthy boundaries for yourself will teach them to this for themselves...no this hurts, no this doesnt feel good...never forget..youre not alone...how many ladies have their lives all together? ....looging for rolemodels (other couples) help....
Lovely times we live in for music
Billie and Finneas singing like: 😞🥺🥹😭😢  Her band like: 🤩😙🥳😁😀
I just cannot believe the voice that comes out of Billie, it's so inspiring to see someone so talented!! Can we get Billie and Hozier together??!?
She lost the “thang” this ain’t it
Voice. Wow.
She’s been famous for so long and yet is still humbled by the tiny desk experience. What a talented, modest human.
I hate the fact I like listening to Billie Eilish. I’m a 49 year old man, for f$ck sakes. It’s hard when the other people who like the music you like are 15. Hey you…stop looking at me. I’m strictly here as a desk aficionado.
Holy f✨️ck this is good! 🔥🥰
She’s come so far as a performer. This set RULES. 🔥❤️🤘
Imagine if a real singer like Chappell sang these songs.
WhyWhtsssss
Billie and Finneas are a true gift to music
Obsessed with this softer version of The Greatest!
So good!
She is not Christina, but at least is not fake. Like it
This is gonna break the internet man .
When I stare out at the world with Arcane eyes, Remember to play Billie Eilish in the background for me 🥷
Beautiful voice as usual!!!🔥🙌🏾
Betterhelp is a plague that needs to end.
Skipped through the entire video... couldn't tell the difference from each  song 😂...all them breathy tracks sound.the same
i love her voice, no autotune needed whatsoever
amazing, charming and calming!! million thanks to the team and the performers ♥ xoxo
a New Generations Frank Sinatra.  gotta recognize
this woman is so talented.
Wow!!! So so beautiful ❤❤
There's really no better vocal sound than sibling harmonies.
<3 <3 amazing as usual, I love you Billie & Finneas
THERE GIVING ME MS RACHEL AND HER HUSBAND VIBES.
esto me da años de vida 🥹❤️‍🩹
A wonderful thing happens when artists are nervous and a little vulnerable. Just look at her hands in the beginning. After all the fame, mega concerts, and tours, it's beautiful to hear such a pure performance. This is art. Thank you Billie Eilish and Tiny Desk!
Hi, do you know which guitar model is used in the first song?
Dude betterhelp and ag1 is everywhere. I have a bad feeling about this.
I thought the thumbnail was Charlie
⏳😘
🥰
AGUANTE CATRIEL Y PACO AMOROSO
Billie can sing, I never knew.
I wish she picked better songs……
I wish she had did wildflower on here
Loved it
Phineas deserved better soundcheck+reverb on his mic whut
She’s incredibly talented
I like the way Billie carries herself.  Her voice is everything to👀😭💃🔥 her brother Finneas a good sing writer to!
okay so cool but it would be so much better with BILLIE EILISH singing lol
😁❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
El chavo de Rebelde tocando el piano le da un toque muy chido a este Tiny.
Why do they look so much older than what they are? Like she’s really 22?
Tiny Desk killing it on the recording as always. Respect
❤
FINALLY
WE NEED CLAIRO
Had to rewatch the last song like 20 times I’d pay $250,000 to have u play this at my wedding
This sucks
WHATAAAAAAAAAAAA? BILLIE?
New Charlie skin just dropped
❤
That was amazing!! Billie Eilish you are a beautiful force!
Sabrina carpenter next pls!!!😊
finally!!!
Sza please bring this❤
It’s sweet how excited the NPR staff is
🫶🏻
Better help sponsored 😞
Listening to angels
0:37 I read someone say to listen to this as a POV OF child to parent and I can’t UNSEE IT!!!!!
this was so good 😭😭😭💗
i need 10 new albums right now.... pls start off with jazz 🙏🙏🙏
Surreal
Beautiful voice. Can someone tell me the name of the first song, Please.

Billie your music is so magical!
AAA I love thissss amazing jobbb
Stunning performance all around
Noah Kahan next
The amount of ads in this one video jeeez🫠
Doechii’s amazing tiny desk and now Billie!
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I mean it wasn't bad but come on..
i just took off my headphones and now i see this... damm i have to listen to this with its full quality, gimme back my headphones😭❤
The fact that, of all channels, NPR is putting ads right in the middle of songs is absolutely infuriating.
Brilliant. Need more performances like this. A great connection between Artists and Audiences.
The ads are so annoying 😑
I wish Amy Winehouse was still alive and she covered any of Billie Eilish songs. They would sound so awesome * 🔥
Yeah finally Billie❤🎉
I want this version of BIRDS OF A FEATHER on the soundtrack of the movie of my life.
Adoravelll!!!
tiny desk pls do not do wat boilroom doing
GOAT
The greatest is the best song for a tiny desk, the felling of this songs are a mood  💙 What a talent !
Tiny Desk always brings the best work out of every musician.
Oh ew, Betterhelp. Do better, NPR.
Wow
The Love Of My Life is phenomenal. Is like a full mature version of her. The outfit is nice but I wish to see her in much nicer clothes.
What happened to her arm😢
Noooo tiny desk! Why betterhelp! Please do your due dilligence!
não existe!! essa voz atravessa qualquer um!!
TE AMO BILLIE, POR TI VIVO!!!!!!!!! You’re the best singer in the world!!!!!!
Is Billie being Manipulate ?
Te amo Billie
One of these artists I don´t really listen the studio/ producer stuff of.  But I could listen to the acoustic sessions all day long :) Some artists are just better pure and simple.
I absolutely balled my eyes out with the greatest. 🥺
My favorite artist on tiny desk, sun shining, life good.
She’s rlly just a girl
I LLOVEE YOU Billie Eilish <3
❤❤❤❤
way he looks
This made my day <3 0:30 THE GREATEST 6:42 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 i love you 18:27 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
It was all going so well until finneas tried to harmonise on birds of feather 😳
She is perfect
First song remind me of Jeff Buckley 🥲🥹👏👏👏
Completely unexpected
Billie you have my heart
Her singing The Greatest with Finneas brought me joy 🥹🫶🏾!!!!!!!
What a way to start. I love you tiny desk!
face card NEVER declines.
she is so stunning it's unreal.
I wish Billie would "rebrand" to reflect Finneas as her band-mate! (They could "hire" their fav musicians!)  BECOME a Rock & Roll band! (That way, Billie could gain some peace?)  ...do the OPPOSITE of OTHER artists/bands (for EXAMPLE,   Gwen Steffani/NoDoubt Linda Ronstadt/The Eagles Ann & Nancy/Heart (<well, tbh/fair THESE sisters won the struggle and kept the name/accolades!) Dolores O'Riordan, Björk
La Mano arriba todo el mundo que llegó Paquito.....
Ok so that’s not a “tiny” desk…just sayin.
11th time listening to this
I love you
Beautiful performance! She has a perfect voice ong
Y A VOS TE GUSTA EL NUEVO FLAMENCO Q ESTAMOS INVENTANDO D SCRAKK4 (EY) H D r8Y0s VES QUE SOMOS KABABY Y NO OCULTO 5R8M COMO VOS Y TUS PALLS PORFA ABURRI DE ESCRIBIR + CON TUS PALLS NO ME OFENDAS OCULTANDO EL ALFABETO IN DESING OF ALL PEOPLE
🎉❤🎉
Simply amazing!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
BETTER SHAPES OF LITERATURE FOR FUY ME
Her emotion is so raw. You can tell she means every word she sings.
Otro que le queda chico a c tangana
The first 5 minutes 100% made me cry. lol
Gonna need the whole discography on tiny desk billie ♡
Las manos arriba todo el mundo que llego paquito.
This song is beautiful! The band is tight and Billie and her brother’s harmony and chemistry is tight! Wonderful! Such a simple song but it comes together so well! Classic! ❤❤
That fear never goes away 11:52 🧡☀
There’s some great performances. Pass on this one. She’s really bad without auto tune
Just started listening 🎶 to this amazing artist/ band recently . After 63 years, it still baffles my mind that 5 people and a bunch of wood/ strings could sound so beautiful  .
❤❤❤
CARACA Q FODAAAAA ❤
Paramore next pls!
why'd i start crying at like 4:35
the fact that she still gets nervous after all these years of preforming is crazy and makes her even more admirable
Por que só o rapaz preto ficou em pé? Se tem dois tocando instrumentos de corda?
I’m a simple gal. I see billie eilish. I click
Her soul and gentle jazzy voice I love this 💕😭 I hope she gets to rest and get lots of sunshine and time to herself to recover
Billie’s got sore knees….
I love this. But I still think these highly talented siblings should be considered a duo, and not just as Billie Eilish solo. Because Finneas writes a large portion of what you hear, plays the instruments, and produces/mixes/masters the final product. The Billie writes lyrics and provides vocals. So why aren’t they considered a duo? They could go as their shared last name, O’Connel.
Gosh… I melted with “L’amour de ma Vie” 🙌🏽🫶🏽❤️☺️
I think this is a unique artist.
The way I GASPED and automaticaly cried when "i love you" started playing
Billie, please give us a Christmas album 🎄 ♥️😓
this would be sponsored by better help
12:06 🖤 🖤 😢
Finneas ❤
Please Tiny Desk, could you invite Steve Lacy? 🙏
Why am i crying 😭 I love you Billie
Her voice is so soothing it’s unreal
shes more and more beautiful
ABSOLUTE CHILLSS
Oh Billie
The world's gone mad! Now Billy Idol is a 22 year old woman from California. Sounds quite good, though. I like their new dirrection
the way he admires billie when she’s singing is so sweet 🥲🥲
i love billie bad but .. leave tiny desk for the brown ones lol clock it.
Secos
Meh, wasn’t Mac Miller or Anderson .Paak level of art, but a solid 7.8/10. Bravo William Eyelash.
We NEED THE SETIONS ON SPOTIFY
I love Billie Eilish but she does not need a Tiny Desk Concert. This used to be a great place to discover new artists, not to hear semi-acoustic perfomances by some of the biggest names in music.
Amei ❤️
It finished before it started 😅. Amazing I enjoyed every bit of it ❤
when she said this my brother i was like yea we know thats FINNEAS😆
didnt sing wildflower ☹
Ne-Yo tiny desk concert still being the best one, so far, followed by Justin Timberlake.
😍😍
Nicki Nicole que linda se te ve
Oof. Listening to the first song right after breakup of a similar circumstance... cathartic. And so emotional.
Lol.  Where did her accent go?  Eminem still has his.  Lol.
I justo say a one sentence: SHE'S SO AMAZING
Shes stunning
Wow, her voice has always been great but her rifts and runs have become even more soulful than before. Also, harmonies with Phineas are amazing. 😍
i love tiny desk, tiny desk gives me life
This was spectacular
My love for Billie is getting stronger and stronger in each and every day. Watching her grow while growing along her songs since 2019, I could never be more thankful that I discovered her. I'm truly proud of her. ❤
incredible
Man, this is beautiful.
OMG, I've been waiting for this so long
Maravilhosa.
She didn’t sing Ocean Eyes?
another one iktr 🥹
So happy to see a mainstream artist create music that has layers, meaning, & shares all of the real concepts of great music. love u billie!
It’s been such a beautiful journey to watch Billie gracefully develop from ocean eyes to hit me hard and soft. Billie has always had this special ability to portray my every feeling and will forever have such a big place in my heart. I’m so beyond proud of her and the persons she’s become.
Hearing her pronounce her R's is good. happy about it
Old Hollywood vibrato. Billie is a Julie Garland meeting Billy Holiday I hear Etta as well. Beautiiful . Those peeperss tell a story the lyrics may miss, the eyes don't lie.
Amazing! I wish this was 5x longer
Good song, songer and musicians it's rights authenticity. Merci
billie's voice melts my heart and it's a stone
So captivating. I love everything about this!!!!! 🥰
wait what was this giggle for? Lol 15:24
Jesus christ! I had no idea 😮
She's getting better and better!! Like I swear, her live vocals always been good but these days it reached the point to where it's just intensively delivered. I mean the control over her voice was insane ❤
Nmchs Billie xq no cantaste Chihiro :/
It’s hard to believe that she’s only 22. Her voice sounds like a lifetime of living.
Audio engineer clutching that Christmas bonus
We got to listen an acoustic version of 'The Greatest' here. Her soft vocals during the supposed screaming part was so good ❤
10:00 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦approve ✅
19:29 LOVE U BILLIE 💙💙
Why was I not able to get the old Billie ocean eyes vibe. I want more. I looove her music all of it but this one seemed to short I want to really hear her sing
Great hearts .. beautiful
As someone who is not thast familiar with William Eyelash that much....they are actually really easy on the ears and insanely talented.
!
uf el mejor tino desk de 2024.  <3<3 te amoooooo billieeeee
I need this on vinyl plzzz
a morir :c
bring feng suave pleasee
and here i was struggling to live, then i seen this... thanks for giving me a little bit of peace today.
Mbaaaa Billie i love you
The best voice
Listening to The Greatest really feels like a heartfelt tribute to myself, from myself
i am begging you for a tiny desk concert with twenty one pilots
YYEESS, she finally looks happy 😢
She's so beatifull 🥹🩷
Josh Newell killed it on this one... my ears are in awe of the crispness and clarity
This was recorded a while back, as Doechii’s video has Billie’s hat in it which concludes that they did Billie’s video first probably around the time of her (Billie’s) album release.
The way fine as watches her the hole time she sings is so beautiful, if you have siblings you just know. Her music also just makes you feel seen. They’re all so good together
Que maravilla, todo!
Literally the best singer of this generation🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼 her vocals are unbeatable!!!
those lips and those eyes are the only thing I care about here
Jesse gold and billie eilish collab would be insane
I watched this concert with a friend yesterday evening. It was my first time experiencing Billie Eilish, as I'm from an older generation and hadn't had the chance to check her out before. I must say I wasn't disappointed, even though I usually gravitate towards 'harder' music. She truly strikes a chord within.
Clicked with the quickness for my girl!!🤩
She is perfect 😍
Remind me of a Damien Rice album 🔥💯
tiny desk in their bag this year
🎨🎉🎼👋🌸🐞💮🍭🎡👍🫡
🔥🔥🔥
Please open your beautiful eyes 😢
Idk who is the man that’s next to her but she needs to let her sing alone. Their voices don’t blend together
bass guy is so cool
like the way she expresses the feeling.
sublime. wow wow wow
Does anyone know his guitar model (in the first song)?
I'm so happy, that I met her so long ago, and she's come so far.I love all this, my god
the better help ad really junpscared me ngl
Absolute. Vocal. Perfection.
siblings by nature, lovers by choice
So much of today’s music involves autotune. Then there’s this.
Billie is that you in Dirty with KSI?
Let's listen to this on repeat such a lovely girl with a one in a lifetime voice and talent ❤❤❤
no meow meow meow meoooow 😿
bro i need bitersuite live.
Finally! A venue where the attendees can actually hear Billie whisper sing her songs.
Nice surprise this Tiny desk. Superb music.
молодец. и даже извинилась, когда поправили микрофон. учитесь быть звездами.
Loveeee
🗑️
I just saw her live a few days ago. Her voice is incredible. She's so talented and beautiful ❤
What's up with the shelves filled with clutter? Who's the hoarder at NPR?? Ugh, distracting!
Those harmonies OMG And her voice is angelish.
I lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve u Billie we loooooooooves u
She's pretty mid for singing tbh. Sorry fanboys, just not that great.
Por qué nunca canta sus mejores temas
This is so good
The audience is so sweet, she really deserves this after what was going on on her tour recently.
que lindo, meu deus
Mid performance ESPECIALLY after Doechi
*Billie & Fin are amazing artists!* : Tiny Desk Concerts provided an artist a space to perform stripped down & right in your face (on your screen).  You can hear every, single note. Only the Best of the Best can perform a TDC because there's no fluff.
Bought premium before I press play because this will be a MASTERPIECE. ❤
nice
Beautiful as ever
Thank you 🍀🤗. This sounds wonderful to my ears and to my soul.
i love “i love you” it just is yes
My Billie My Eilish ❤
This was beautiful
Billie, você acalma minha alma
Guendouzi on the drums
No estoy llorando, solo estoy escuchando "i love you"...
The way Phinneas always looks at Billie is trully heartwarming
18:27
Perfeito ❤
Dont waste your time, she don't sing meawmeaw
what i love about Billie is that she doesn't sing for us, but for HERSELF. and this is BEAUTIFUL. She doesn't sing for the approval of others, but for her own expression and enjoyment.
She so cold bro. A gift fr ❤
E O BRUNO MARSSSSSSS??????????
E O BRUNO MARSSSSSS??????
I love Billie So Baddddd
Consistently in the last several years, Artists are coming on Tinydesk with arrangements and production that beat the "studio" recordings by a long, long way. Makes me think that by limiting what you can do by what can be physically achieved by a few musicians in a corner of a room, artists, producers and engineers are forced into real focus on what a song truly is, and what's needed to best communicate that - rather than fall back on habit, feeling tied to genre convention, or "filling in the gaps" to make up for incomplete arrangements or less compelling songwriting and/or  performances. I've been producing for about 15 years and have always preferred to build up music layer by layer, but this show is increasingly exposing to me what I may be losing with this approach.
🖤🖤🖤
✨
Finneas and that unnecessarily loud microphone. Save singing that loud for your solo career, my dude.
Billie Eilish is worth a thousand Taylor Swifts, and I'm not even a Billie Eilish stan
Me he enamorado ❤️
5:24 always puts a PHAT lump in my throat.
Te amo Billie ❤❤❤
I love that they played I love you, always has been one of my faves aswell
OMG!!! Beautiful!
Best tiny desk so far, crazy good!
I love that they support small artists
Did you see her smile while singing I love you just for hiding her pain and trying to not cry 🥺
4.4 million views in a couple of days is insane!
its time to call geordie greep to a tiny desk concert
The best of our generation, they getting better and better
in the clerb, we all cryin
Espectacular!
Te amo billi eilish ❤
That DEI bassist tho
Wow.. never really listened to this girl before..  Beautiful sounds! THANK U!
That piano player has charisma- who are they? Is this like that tiny desk where i found out anderson paak’s bassist is simply Thundercat?
Beautiful girl, beautiful voice; smart talented young lady, a lot in one package.
came here for everything i wanted left with loving everything else ❤
Finneas bro im sorry but u guys need real musicians in that band. playing the chords youve writen is not enough for this type of show. play with some professionals and let them add some different flavour pls. and buy an arp for the keyboard player :D
Beautiful,  loved it 😊 ❤
I just love how finneas always claps, when she finished one of their songs.
Why does Billie Eilish look like an angel when singing "Birds of a Feather"? 😭😭
Es impresionante, esto es muy impresionante. Hermosa Billie ❤
INCREÍBLE TE AMO BILLIE
She has such great control of how she projects her voice. Mic control is a skill not all musicians understand. I have made respect for this lady.
Y'all peep my freestyles
I LIKE TO BILLIE EILISH ❤
We need Allie X please!
Why all this howling and whining? Take some singing lessons!
I actually can’t stand her voice here.
It was beautiful thank you!
I’m in love with this woman
just marvelous!
this is art
Whenever Billie said the song I love you I covered my mouth and started singing and crying immediately ❤
Absolutely a generational talent.
GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The drummer that doesn't play drums lol.
ahhhh Billie & Finneas on tiny desk ✨️✨️✨️ to hear the harmonies so clearly ❤
Saudade é uma das palavras mais bonitas da Língua Portuguesa. Obrigada, Billie Eilish e Fineas por trazer o Romantismo de volta ao Pop (romantismo no sentido da literatura mesmo, não dessas coisas bobas que as pessoas espalham nas redes sociais), as músicas de vocês são poesias, é literatura musical. ❤
betterhelp is the sponsor of this npr video. Enough said.
Finneas loves her so much i love their relationship so much ❤
Eu claramente vejo que Billie Eilish não é um artista solo, e sim uma dupla. Eles deveriam se apresentar como dupla. A Billie vive dizendo "nosso álbum", "nossa música"; porque Billie Eilish sempre foi um projeto dos dois. Usar o artista solo é apenas porque, historicamente, artistas pop solo sempre se destacaram mais.
Magic Girl
<3
Quality,ut awful too
Sunkist third eye smize
I was waiting for this 🩵✨
I’ve heard a lot of bad things about betterhelp. Billy is amazing, just so real.
Katy perry next.
I love it!  Only thing she could have done better is to say the full names of the band members. Not necessarily of her brother- he has already a famous name. But the others.
Luv this, needed other álbum full acoustic please 🙏🏼
Omgggg 4.5 million in 1 day??? That’s completely insane !!!
New Billie Eilish is not good man
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
commericials are killing me
Finneas should’ve sat this one out vocally. Coming in and out off key is not the vibe.
Awesome
Are there any better musical siblings? 🤩
AN AD IN THE MIDDLE IS CRIMINALLLLLLL
taylor swift after watching this : Pure anxiety!!!!
Every artist should be judged by what they can present at the NPRTD. Like many, Billy is not my lane based purely on her releases... but this is very, very good.
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
❤❤
Im curious how a full song without comped vocals would sound, her one takes sound so angelic naturally.
La mejor
I normally have tiny desk on in the background but this time I couldn’t keep my eyes off the screen
SONG ''birds of a feather'' OF B. EILISH is MUSIC MADE BY  Zlatan Stipišić ON THE ''u ljubav vjere nemam'' from OLIVER DRAGOJEVIC  RECORDED IN 1994 CROATIA RECORDS !!!
I honestly did not want this tiny desk to end I could have listened to them all day!
this performance of The Greatest both broke my heart and mended my soul. such amazing beauty.
the HAIRS competition 😆😆🤪🤪
I can not play this …
Lovely that Tiny Desk is giving a chance to small time music artists.
No meowmeowmeowmeow, 8/10
She is incredible. A generational talent
Tiny desk aint messing around! trying their best <3
I just can’t even begin to describe how incredibly talented these twin stars are. Absolutely dynamic 👏🏻
WOW 💐
coe Billie Eilish brota no rj fazer um show na penha
she always get me enchanted
Umm, kinda…perfect. Definitely. Perfect.
Billie sucks tho
Please reconsider being associated with betterhelp, its not trustworthy and a scam
not me crying for half of this video
Timestamps?!
Finneas's voice, which accompanies Billie's, is truly warm and full of compassion.
Que mulher linda mds, casaria ❤
living legend
Her soft voice is perfect for Tiny Desk. Thank you for this lovely performance.
Incredible.
THIS CHANNEL MUST BE in 4K. Also, would be great if rock bands attended Tiny Desk as well. Like the good old MTV Unpluged days.
We need more😭
Beautiful.
She is amazingly talented. Her deep passion and dedication is inspiring.  It’s easy to see why her fans love her.
It’s unbelievable how talented Billie and finneas are! like they never miss! 🔥❤️
I’m marrying her soon DAWGOWNSHAME 4🐶🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺🐾🦴 PRESIDENT!🎉(4PHLAT)
21st century, meet _chamber music_ chamber music, _the internet_ there... all properly introduced.... I'll leave you guys to get acquainted.
Beautiful
i had no hesitation to click
This performance alone proved that she deserves all her success in the industry. Her voice and talent are just 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻 perfect
What’s going on with tiny desk this year! This is amazing!
I have always loved them, but it strucks me so hard here how much they were born for this, and I am so grateful they continue to choose this path.
I wish this was an hour longer
OMG BILLIE IS ON TINY DESK BESTIE WAKE UPPPPPP
Dope ❤
My gosh, the narrative they crafted with these three songs, incredible. What an amazing set. It feels so complete with only three songs. That’s a real feat!
first time the piano starts with a few high notes just hits so nice.
We musiclovers worldwide are so lucky to have Billie !
The band seems totally into it
I thought she was drinking Mountain Dew 😂
Billie👏
💙💙💙💙💙
The intro to "The greatest" gives off an immense Ichiko Aoba vibe. Does anyone know if she is a direct influence on Billie's music, or is it just a coincidence?
Amo eles! 💙💙💙
Putting a portuguese word to describe this was so poetic. _thanks in Brazilian_
Transcendental 👏🥺💙
ITS CHRISTMAS 🥲
Catriel y Paco Amoroso dejaron la vara muy alta
The ads placed in the MIDDLE of songs are killing me. Here's two things to do: 1.) the second time you play the song the ads don't interrupt; 2.) boycott the product,big you buy the product it only encourages them.
IMMA EAT EVERY SINGLE PERFORMANCE OF BIRDS OF A FEATHER UP FR!!! 😭❤
i just imagine what if billie eilish featuring with nadin amizah
아.  귀여워….ㅜ
Brainwashed liberal
Put headphones on.  Lie down on bed.  Cover myself with blanket.  Listening to Billie Eilish.   Bliss.
I loveeeeeeeee Billie’s music so much 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Good job billie and finneas. You both have made it. Bless you ❤️
I just cannot explain how deeply i love this girl !!!!!!!
I’ve never been a huge fan of Billie. Not my style, I never thought she was bad but just not my taste.    This performance changed that for me. Absolutely beautiful talent.
you"re so fcking hot asf billie and also the lovely voice
Wow. Ive never resonated with someone’s voice and musicality so much. She and Finneas are so incredibly talented! This wasn’t long enough!
Nothing like a sibling harmony 🙌 also praise to the mixing engineer on this one. The sound is so clean 😮‍💨
MA GOAT🫵👑🐐
When was this recorded?
Now this is music
Te amo Billie
Waiting for a jazz album
This was so quick... The world needs more acoustic Billie.
Boring
Wow. Ive never resonated with someone’s voice and musicality so much. She and Finneas are so incredibly talented!
I want her and Tash Palmer to do a song together , can we get tash on here?
La elegancia!!! El alma al aire!!!!!
What a Christmas gift 🎁 Thank you Tiny Desk
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
it amazes me how much her voice has changed... her technique is absolutely amazing! i am a fan since 2017 and sometimes can't even believe that this is the same person. love her sm! and finneas is the GOAT.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
the amount of bot comments is insane lol
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
PLEASE MAKE VINYL PRESSINGS OF THESE.
Whoever says that great music can’t be found in today’s popular music scene is not watching the Tiny Desk series.  The first time I ever heard Billie Eilish was when she was the artist on an espisode of SNL circa 2019.  The first song she played was “I Love You”…that became an instant favorite of mine and remains so to this day.   I love this series, thank you NPR!
how much i love her is simply bizarre...
love this but can companies stop promoting betterhelp
my entire roman empire
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Amazing content as always!
Thank you for the great content!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Thank you NPR
I love how you used Saudade in the description. Portuguese girl here ❤️
You explained this so well, thank you!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
She is so cute!
These guys will go down in history for sure. Such beautiful music - sung so beautifully. Thankyou
Loved the content, keep it coming!
how could one not love her?! 🙂 she’s adorable!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Her voice is unreal
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Does anyone think Billie is wearing a binder? To make her clothes fit the esthetic she’s going for?
Great job, this video was very useful!

18:27 omg 😫🤍
All her songs sound the same.
Hi, please don't support Better help
Billie this is the NEW SET LIST are you kidding me
I wish billie was touring near me because i would do literally anything to see her in concert except spend more than $400 total
I think she's talented, but her voice just isn't for me.
Obrigada pelo presente de Natal, NPR!
Why is this so short 😢
BEST!!!
I Love!!!! BILLIE ❤
BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT EVER!!!! LOVE YOU BILLIE !!!!!!
6:42
'And many more believed because of his own word; And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.   (John 4:41-42) 'Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.   (1 Peter 1:2) 'By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.   (Hebrews 11:8) 'And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.   (Mark 1:15) 'Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.   (Romans 6:11) 'Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.   (Galatians 6:7) 'For as a snare shall it come on all that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.   (Luke 21:35-36)
The way she sings perfect in acoustic is literal art and talent
Amo a Billie❤
I have no words for this woman...
bored
je t'aime Billie
You're the greatest Billie
That's a big desk. Fake news
What an exquisite performance. Billy makes me proud be a fellow Los Angeleno. She's amazing!
❤❤❤❤❤
Love you billie!!!
what about a lana del rey tiny desk?
I wish she would do a lullaby album.  Such a beautiful voice!
She's special
Beyonce Tiny Desk PLEASE!
Ok, im crying like a baby
I’m an old man and a really untalented long time musician but in my humble opinion these two are up there in the stratosphere of talent. And uh yeah I wish I was younger and could meet Billie for coffee.
she might be a sexist bully but she's very very talented
I heard her only at the beginning of her career, when her hits were everywhere, but hearing this... Just wow... the first thing that came to mind.. just wow. Sounds so nice
They live, feel and are music.  It is a great present they are giving to all peoples. I hope I have enough time to see more of their way
So glad they both took the time to do this performance, having such busy lives with being icons in all Thank you, NPR Music for booking the show. The waiting list must have been crazy, haha!
That voice, man. She is made for acoustic sets. For a long time I was unable to connect with her music, but I love her more and more. What a talent.
Does she not like the other songs on the album? She only does the same songs for every live performance 😭
Fantastic. Artists should just record albums there.
maravilhosa!
She has to do another one! Her Barbie song rocks
I try for the  last 5 minutes to see this video, but ads run it over. Thank you!
the people want BENEE
eatin ain't cheatin.
I love so much the sibling connection they have, like the way Finneas just looks at her in such a loving way
wow Billie and Finneas together, pure gold <3 a Childhood dream hhh
11:52 <3
this chick sucks bad 👎
PER FECT
Cantora de verdade, em suma, com técnica musical e vocal. Artista: pensa na obra, na melhor forma de compor, apresentar e é uma intérprete, sua alma de desnuda. Na geração do auto tune, dos produtos pop ela é um Oásis.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
beautiful!
❤❤❤
Te amo billie haceme un pibe
cried all throughout the greatest. chills throughout all of birds of a feather. i’ve been listening since the beginning of her career and im just so happy she’s still making music and it just keeps getting better and better. i adore these acoustic versions
Billie had little to no reverb on this, no auto tune! She surely is one of the best singers in the world! Period! SUPERB Concert Billie and Finneas! also the rest of the band smashed it!
the goosebumps I got during this
very sweet singing you bring the emotion . bravo
Wow. I like.
No wildflower 😭
♥️
Why is no one talking about their terrible sponsor? Usually videos sponsored by betterhelp get a ton of backlash, and rightfully so!!
I wish i could give a superlike in this video
Billie has a very soulful touching voice beautiful wishing you a Happy 23rd Birthday 🎂
SHES SO CUTE 😭😭😭😭
This is so beautiful
Mother legend
I love you
love her❤
Masterpiece
isnt betterhelp in a really bad shape to be sponsored by it still?  or are they really doing better now.  like them getting unprofessional, unlicensed psychiatrist is kinda not cool
I’ve never heard her music before this was a great introduction! Great work
Wow
4m views in 1 day, fell off fr
She is WOW💜
i love that woman
How is that slim long field mic picking up her voice even while her mouth is facing a completely different direction ?
Love u Billie and Finneas
Wow
Falto blue 😢
This is such a masterpiece! What an incredible talent!❤
TE AMO
No autotune needed🥺❣️ Your voice is magical.
If Billie Eilish sang as much as she looks like she's singing she really would be singing.
Love this. I love tiny desk ❤
dang
Wonderful
The most overated singer in the industry by far!!! Her range is small and hides it by whispering!!!
essa garota emociona demais! pure heart singer
AVRIL LAVIGNE, PLS ❤️‍🔥
I Jump on the vid THAT’S CRAZY
This is the best Christmas gift I could have ever received! Thank you
ahhh i love billie so much. My son and I both!
In complete awe 🫠
I hear a little Chris Martin in Finneas
No ocean eyes
I was going to share this, but I *will not* promote BetterHelp in any way, shape or form. It saddens me that you have to.
For being nervous, Billie sure nails it! So good. Watching a stadium packing artist presented like they're a local band at a coffee house is the beauty of Tiny Desk. Thank you, NPR crew for bringing an intimate setting with beautiful sound on a consistent basis.
Billie probably has her finger more on the pulse of what is happening now than Taylor .
No meow meow meow no like
Seguramente veas este video, espero estés bien:)
I listened to "The Greatest" so much this year that in my YouTube retrospective, it became the soundtrack of my life, or something like that. I love this song so much.
This is absolutely brilliant
I think tiny desk is just the new wave tbh
Shoutout Ksi for putting her on!
Reminds me of fumar castañas
Imagine dusting those shelves behind them
Beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who stood on the cat
좋은 노래, 좋은 연주 고마워요~ 👍👍
I’m a bit late to this party, I’ve heard some songs from them but I just watched this in complete awe. Absolutely fantastic performance and truly beautiful songs. Brilliant band and it sounded amazing. Wonderful artists ❤️🤩😎
Billie forever 😢❤
Why am I crying?!
好好聽。
ILY MY LOVE!!
Obrigado!
I had tears on my eyes the whole time. Billie and Finneas are unreal in this ❤
Loved that song that souds like Saria's Song
The improvisation is great, she's not doing too much.
Elle m’apaise
thank you ❤
good
i was here
Tiny desk great audience
For sleep it's perfect
man, i cried...
I’m blown away!!! This is so great!
17:28 Did anyone notice that she tryna fix his wig?
Still one of the strongest voices in modern day pop culture
alotta hair in this one lol
Hit's! Just hit's!!😢
❤
Has it always been this short??? I want more❤❤
I love you guitar part kinda sounds like lost woods zelda song
¿Hay algo que está mujer no haga bien? 🛐
I just love Billie 🤷🏾‍♂️🔥
ELA É SIMPLESMENTE UMA CANTORA ESPETACULAR
SOUL II SOUL 👍 luv! seria uma boa!
FINNEAS tiny desk concert when?
sorry my tears js dropped
actual goosebumps and chills on birds of a feather it might be the most romantic song ever
Loved this! Can the ads go at the end of songs before speaking parts……….. not in the middle of songs…..?
❤❤❤
Nice. 👍
you guys. please put these on spotify like the colours versions pls we're begging
I wish she performed Blue :(
Thank you Billie, for existing
The voice blends smoothly..siblings vocal romance❤
Starting a petition for Tiny Desk Concerts to be on Spotify, cmon people
love it
Marvellous! Hot band.😊 Thankyou.
these tiny desk concerts are going so hard lately
Yes
This is criminally short
The great value version of The Civil Wars
💛wow
❤❤❤❤
It’s always Billie and her brother singing and playing the guitar🥺.
Wow, they sound so nice, I love this band! Hats off to everyone involved in gifting this music to us.
the best band) the best guys)))
So when are you guys releasing tiny desk's vinyls special like the mtv og ones ? Cause I really want that in my life please !
Beautiful person, beautiful voice. ❤
Dang, Andrew brought it on "birds of a feather"!
Sza when?
there’s a tenderness in her sadness, a velvet ache that wraps around your own little tragedies. her music doesn’t fix you, it doesn’t promise anything it can’t give. it just whispers, “Me too.” and suddenly the room isn’t so empty.
❤❤❤ beautiful voice!
The first song is very Bonnie Prince Billy vibes 🙂
his brother looks like from yellowstone
Ugh why is her hair always messed up so ungrateful.  Apl these songs except for birds of a feather are garbage and boring and depressing and birds of a feather has been played out But i did like her vocal enhancements on birds of a feather here she was giving extra:) Finias shut up except for that add lip of the chorus while she was singing  Nice looking band
what a bunch of beautiful musicans... and Billie!🧡
This is the best highschool band ever.
She is such a heavenly angel from above 🤍
no one talking about the orangewood guitar god
she brings out the inner 12 year old me out, her music paints the last moments of my life while transitioning to teenagehood into a beautiful picture
UM THE DESCRIPTION?!!!???? that’s soul crushing omg yes
Billie, we want an acoustic album!!!
​​Ultra MAGA
Como mejoró Niki
Broke up recently. Was bawling by the last song.
This is the first time I've heard Billie Eilish - staggeringly talented and charmingly open and humble. What a delightful human - and those sibling harmonies are utterly gorgeous.
Love her so much ❤ the ads are so irritating though ruin the whole vibe
so i need to be able to download these versions RIGHT NEOW like rn all of em why do they get better and better
You know what, I don't care about you at all anymore, I don't want to have you in my heart anymore, but from now on I have X in my heart and... say goodbye, so you can say goodbye to me too, okay? 👍👍👍 Goodbye 👍👍👍
This was soooooo beautiful, can we get a Sia one please???
Sorry, Meh.
Can you give a call to Jon Bellion ? 👀
Tiny desk of Billie Eilish always the best ever. Love how she and his brother enjoy to perform.. honestly it would be completely if Billie sing "Happier Than Ever"
This is beautiful, its a shame YouTube feels the need to push ads every 5 minutes and completely disrupts the vibe of watching this.
Umm anything but this new album. Please please please
Her including I love you in this made my whole week
Billie's the GOAT 🐐❤
All I can hear is the skype call sound in the opening song
Thank you for healing us Billie with your voice. I feel like this world is filled with hate right now. Your so calming, unless you make a scary music video. 😂
Billie Eilish is just as good, if not, better in an acoustic setting. Her vocal talent and her musical ability should never be undermined. She’s not a “pop star” to me, she’s a “really captivating young artist”.
In my opinion, this acoustic way of presenting her music really demonstrates her pure talent. She should definitely create an album of acoustic renditions of her beautifully meaningful songs. Absolutely fantastic.
🔥🎶❣️
Yall better get Malcolm Todd on this
she got billie Eilish Eyes
I pause, I see belly eyelash, I dislike, I close out. 🖕🏽🖕🏽
i have been blessed
Billie eilish looks so fresssssshhhhh 🥺❤️
The best LGBT artist of our times, she sings with soul, like Billie Holiday (i'm a brazilian black guy, she compose "Bird Of Feather' here in São Paulo)
No idea why people like her
Loving the band ❤️
Now do Finneas solo Tiny desk
The girl that jacks fashion from old hip hop is back
I used to rlly like Billie when she came out, but I stopped listening when she became superstar status. It wasn’t because of her popularity but mainly cause everything felt so overproduced. “The Greatest” and “i love you” reminded me of why i liked her so much back then. She’s so talented and tasteful on how she sings and accents notes and tracks like those that feel much more raw not only show her technical skill so much better but also her creativeness and individuality❤
Finneas ❤
I’m sorry, I’m super ignorant to her music but you can’t tell me that that one song around the 10mins mark isn’t just a Zelda song but slowed down.  😭😭😭 I think it’s amazing but it def is.
Loved watching her performances on tiny desk she has such an amazing voice
this girl is way toooooo good
Jeff Buckley would be proud
What a gorgeous young woman she is ❤ with a voice that touches your soul...and so humble with it. She definitely has the X-factor. And Finneas right there by her side ❤ That was a treat to watch. Thank you @BillieEilish for being you 😊
omgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
Amazing singer, great vocal control, excellent music
My favorite tiny desk so far!
Billie ist wirklich ein süßes, sehr talentiertes Mädchen. Wünsche ihr, dass sie nie die Bodenhaftung verlieren wird. Ein guter Charakter ist wichtiger als vieles andere. Billie really is a sweet, very talented girl. Wish her that she will never lose her footing. Good character is more important than much else.
If she's going to play I love you in Amsterdam, I wont be able survive that concert omg
This has the vibe of like if Jason Mraz and Glen Hansard and Ikita Marglova all had a baby
So proud of Billie
my heart came 08:29 .....
Why is the best Tiny Desk episode so Tiny short duration ?
🎉admired Billie from Birds of a Feather, not an OG fan but definitely one now.
OMG! This has to be an album! 💟💟💟
i love thisssss
Producer and postproduction carry.
Billie has the best voice in the world.
That was so good ! Thank you Billie, Finneas and the band this vibe is so beautiful. ❤
Billie so vulnerable and nervous like someone doing their first open mic - then casually "this song just went number one, which is exciting." Love this human and artist so much. ❤️
🫂🤍
No ocean eyes, no show
i love billie so muuuuch  ps. bring taylor back, her new album would fit tiny desk so much!
Billie for superbowl 2026 please
the greatest album ever in history
never thought much about Billie Eilish. i thought, well, another pop musician, not for me. after this video, i will try to be less ignorant...
She can't sing for real. Just whispers all the time.
This is glorious
Get John Mayer on the show!
That's so beautiful that I'll buy YouTube Premium, so I can listen to it all without ads, like 2000 times. Billie Eilish is out of this world.  Absolutely in Love!
なんか痩せた？可愛くなったね💕
kings of convenience vibes😍
Ahh yes my favorit hobbit billie bombertn
ughhhhh i’m so happy she did the note change in i love you 😫😫
"also, I dressed like a girl, it's so weiirrddd"
I think i'm very lucky to watch this for free, how you feel guys?
zayn next please
Sleep Token doing one of these would break the Internet
❤❤❤❤
Thank you Billie and band, for your role in keeping the art alive.
15:48 the way finneas looks at her :')
Is she singing in a binder? Impressive to still have that breath control.
Just insane
billie style going from teenage boy in 2001 to a receptionist
NPR and Tiny Desk are irreplaceable treasures
She fine
Billie 💛
Одна из величайших певиц в истории! А какой красавицей стала! Какие глаза!
Merry and pippin
Masterful. 👏
solid thing
4:01 am simply magnificent. Yoy bring peace to my soul.
❤❤❤
Ok on the left
❤
what an absolutely amazing talent you all are!!!
At the end of the show seems like Bach likes this 🎹performance very much ～
finneas move girl
Dont put ads in middle of music 😢
I wonder how much dust is on those shelves back there
This is unbelievable.
Setlist The Greatest - 0:22 L'amour De Ma Vie - 6:43  I Love Lou - 11:52  Birds of a Feather - 18:27
This chick still relevant?
i love you - is still. besst
(  .    )(    .  )
adds r criminal for real!!!
Thank you for existing <3
Wahnsinn
I am not a fan of Billie as an artist BUT as a woman, the more she grows and matures the more she grows in me with her music as well. Definitely talented and  deeply sensitive. I would love to cook for her and her band/family! Vegan ofc.
I'm Brazilian and Saudade can easily be translated as I miss you
billie is NERVOUS af
Immersed within the first song, another top notch performance at Tiny Desk
She's amazing
They are like the 21st century Carpenters brother sister duo！
Billie I love youuuuuuuu 🫶🏾 the mf goat
Happiest day of my life
00:23 THE GREATEST 06:44 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 I LOVE U 18:27 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
She is an adult now. She looks cute like her mum.
ASIK.
always loved Bilie.... I have to say the Drummer has the best job ever🤣🤣🤣
OVERRATED GLAMOR QUEEN
Billie’s range my God! 🔥🔥🔥
Their parents did so incredibly well to raise two amazing musicians AND siblings. I’ve always found it almost unbelievable how good they sound together and over they time they seem to get only better, this being an example of that. I’m curious what they will produce together in the future. :-)
Omg! Why did I not know she was up next on tiny desk 😭😭😭
Billie is so beautiful 😍 and she looks so tiny here 😅😊 huge perfect voice as ever
No lovely no party
in tears the whole time.. thank you for blessing the world with your art, billie ❤
AINT NO WAY SHE PLAY I LOVE YOU😭 this song brings back so many memories of when I was younger. Just a feeling i can’t get from any other artist (besides Melanie martinez)
Why did it end I could listen to it forever
The facts that it made 3.8 views in 24hr🫶🏽🫶🏽
YES
Billie and Finneas’ parents create the most talented humans on the planet 🌎
🥺🫶
She’s so gd talented. They both are. Just wow. Great band too ❤
Omf billie eilishhhhhhh 😭😭😭 I love her smmmmm such an amazingly talented person I swear. I’d literally love to meet her irl she’s so funny. Also this almost felt like smooth jazz or a quartet playing at a fancy restaurant just more elite yah know?¿
12:54
She’s a great musician and songwriter if she could keep her mouth closed when discussing politics then she would be great
I need a Finneas tiny desk
AHHHHH HOW MUCH I WOULD GIVE TO GO TO A BILLIE CONCERT 😩❤️❤️
i really do like her..
i love her sm 😢
just absolute perfection.
YES been waiting on thisss. Tiny desk always slaps. great job Billie 🥰🥰
and she sang I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AY
WOW
Dang it Billie u made me laugh in the middle of ILY
4:12
I'm so glad she exists, nothing could quite replicate
te odio antonia :(
Nice aesthetics there. Like the suits and ties
I love her ❤ her voice is so real and pure !
i love you with all my life billie🫶🏼
anyone else watch all their videos at .25 playback speed?
the best voice and artist of the decade period :)
i adore herr
god really did
Omg WHATTT
Acoustic tour 2030?
Mediocre, if some random person put this out nobody would listen to it
She's finally here guys
throwing up she is AMAZING !!!!
I wish we could have got a Eillish/Winehouse duet
Aww I can listen and listen ❤
billie, you're the greatest ❤
Her voice is like an angel comes from above ❤
Sorry, let me scoop myself up after melting. ❤
Well this is divine.
God. Make it stop.
She sang the whole session with her eyes closed what a shame she has beautiful blue eyes!
Rip, Finneas doesn't get mentioned again.
Billie and Finneas need to be protected at all costs ♥️
My goodness what an angelic voice, seemingly effortless. Haven’t played piano since both my grandpas died last year, & one of my grandmas just passed Wednesday. For some reason, hearing her sing urged me to play. Doesn’t hurt like it did last year. Anyways, here’s that one way too deep comment connecting the dots in a way that makes no sense, move along now.
Soooo beautiful ❤
This is awesome 😍
❤❤
This is so Awesome.  Has left me Flabbergasted  BILLIE , you are Absolutely so Beautiful and that Voice ,so Angelic 💓 Thx u For The MUSIC 🎶.
I love you was a blessing
The amount of letting your ego go it takes to be the supportive big brother Finneas is. His career as a singer/musician didnt quite take off but years later hes done his absolute best to make sure his sister can peak at everything she's capable of.
I love birds of a feather so much. "knew you in another life" REAL
My god she is brilliant
a melhor tem nome sobrenome
i love youuuuu
That's not a concert that is a background for your activities like cooking or what else. You turn on the flight mode and the only thing you do while watching - you enjoy. This concert makes your day.
*Why do you need 2 guys to remove one chair? I'd love to get paid to remove a chair!*
so good!
billie is so beautiful and talented.
I need more 💔
her singing i love you is just.... whew
I wish this performance could become a bootleg or ended up on Spotify to listen on my car or walking to work. ♥️
The band sounds AMAZING especially the last song. Shout out to everybody behind the scenes. Great sound.
At end of day, Billie is a singer non-pareil. Oh, and Finneas is straight up 🔥
The most overrated artist of the decade! Her weird brother does most of the work.
I wish these were longer !
how beautiful is she😫🥹❤️
Amazing
Ayo! Amazing 🤘
can someone timestamp when the meow meow song starts?
I love billie, her voice is so unique, but as she sang It reminded me a bit of radiohead with I love You, I know she has her own sound, but just something it reminded me of :)
Any fellow grown men here appreciating this set 😭or it just me ?
estuvo culeron no? jseijdsijid
The first Is a cover from diamen rice song?
If there could’ve been an MTV unplugged 🔌❤
Hermosooo, mi rola favorita "I love you", gracias Billie 🖤
Hey voice is really unbelievable
I appreciate the drummer in particular as he brought in various adjustments and variations to the drumset and sticks to play quiet and keep to the very gentle accompaniment here in the tiny desk concert. Kudos to all the musicians, incl Billie, Finneas, and the folks who set up this acoustic space
She ateee
Finneas: guitar and backing vocals.
Hmhas aoty
Te amooo billie
Bass player looks so dang cool. And that bass line in every song is so good😩
hey Billie, i think you’re really pretty!! Wanna be  friendsvv
bro them vocals OML goosbumps
14:16 this song makes a whirlpool in my heart….
Dont care for many modern pop stars but jeez that was so freakin' good
Wow Powder(Jinx) sing so awesome ❤
I wish I had a brother or sister like them to jam with :))))
미친 거 아니야?

Love this. Wish it lasted longer.

Tiny Desk is RAW music
Billie always makes me goosebumps ❤
😇
Wow.
Queen of Pop Industry... Billie Ellish  The Number 1
I became a fan today ❤
Gross. She can’t sing any better than I can and I sound like a yak.
I don't recall Billie Eillish sounding like this. Very nice! 👏
i actually need this in my bloodstream...asap
Those knees are telling a story.

Shes awesome
She has one of the most beautiful voices in the industry. Live vocals wow. ❤❤❤

Billie is the most perfect person in the universe

Their voices are so pretty together. You can hear that they have been singing together their whole lives. And dang they both have the most gorgeous eyes.
piano player.👏
Finally!
Billie, you are the reason I decided to invest in my music. I have your vinyl in my wall :). Absolutely LOVED this album.
Gracias por esta alegría para el alma ❤
i needed to hear  “ i love you” on here , thank you
Wow. What an artist
wow you really cant SING... not that im surprised.
18:27 좋다 20:20 특히 이 부분
i’m absolutely living for the bridge of the greatest, i am FLOATING 💙🤸‍♂️
I just stumbled upon these Tiny Desk performances. They are fantastic! Keep them coming!
istg when she started singing i love you i automatically got tears in my eyes... this song hurts deep down my SOUL (ilove you billie!)
Either she's been signing too much, and her voice is going out. Or she may need a voice  coach.
I can't imagine how difficult that first is to sing that song. It is such an intricate composition.
Love tiny desk but why the short ads in the middle of songs?   That's new and annoying
wow i hope she makes it big one day. good on npr for exposing us to up and coming artists <3
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
15:56 the NOTE CHANGE🥲
Absolutely flawless 🥹💖
I can’t believe that she actually has Rowlf playing piano for her.
1:45, 1:48, 15:30, 15:40, 13:02, 1:55, 3:42, 3:55, 8:29, 9:09, 9:22, 9:24, 9:29, 14:08, 15:40, 15:59 (i cried), 16:35, 16:45
Went back in time with "i love you" and absolutely crumbled...
Sonic excellence! Thank you as always 😎👍 … all of you!
oh my godddddd
I hope someday we find out that Billie and her brother have been bangin this whole time and we find out when she's pregnant.
God that voice is just an absolute weapon. And especially for quiet stuff, she's the final boss of Tiny Desk.
What a powerfull performance. Found myself crying right now!!
You know your music career is garbo when you're performing on NPR. LOL
😍😍😍
That’s insane! How come the beautiful voice
Saw her in Portland, OR last Sunday and she was incredible. She sounded amazing live!! Love hearing them together in this 💕
I ♥️ this! Billie and Finneas are simply amazing!
I think its so important that someone like Billie is famous for who she is.  She has raw talent and a raw appeal.  She won't ever be anything ingenuine to get our attention and there is no faking her voice
That sound is soooo good!  😊
😭
Te amo billie
She’s the definition of perfection!!!
I love you ❤, please make an acoustic album 💿 😢😢😢😢
Her voice really shone through here. Billie's voice is like an angel's!
Part 2 please. This was way too short.
There's no such thing as the best,I'm big fan❤❤❤
2:36 gomen amanai
Neil Tevault WITH THE WIN
I am glad she dressed in plain woman clothes. She is beautiful and should dress more like this. I know she does not like it.   I think at time she hides behind the baggy clothes. You can tell naturally she is sly and does not want the attention. I feel she is slowly growing up to become a confident woman.
Unpopular opinion...Billie has a beautiful voice, but she is incredibly one dimensional.  If you've heard one song, you've heard them all.  I would love nothing more for her to branch out and experiment with some different (fuller) sounds.  The constant whisper singing just get old after awhile.  Even on her upbeat songs, you can still barely hear what she's saying.  What she does, she does better than anyone, but that's all she does.  Her songs are not distinguishable from each other.  Let's hear some range Billie!
18:18
I cried in I love you and got mad at her scars
Es un placer escuchar este arte ✨️💫🤩🙏❣️
John 14:6 --> Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" Jesus loves us all and is coming soon. Let's use this time to get to know Him. Stay blessed yall 🫶🏾
I HAVE NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THISSSS 😭💕
made my day
One of the Greatest musicians and artist for this generation
I guess it's an age thing but I never got the big fuss over her. Sound more like skinning a cat.
i love you made me literally cry so hard 12:46
Can we all step back and appreciate how she memorized all the lyrics and sang thru her soul. What an angel.
What’s crazy is the range of emotions that she sings about yet so peaceful. It’s a testimony of how important peace is in any situation. Colossians 3:15.
Wow I never wanted this to end
nicely done
Beautiful Billie, beter and better voice
❤❤❤
Baby❤
I want 20 more years of her. And then another 20 years. Please.
Nobody... NOBODY can sing like Ms.Billie.
tesla
13:03 Gets me in, everytime.
It's like hearing angels sing from heaven
Long hair prerequisite to be in the band 😂
I don't want her to hurt, but I love the music that comes from it.  She's got such a pure voice and she's kinda got an Amish vibe here I'm diggin.
Loving the faster beat on birds of a feather, but sounds like Billie needed to catch her breathe!
Hay mi niña 😍
Wow, her singing made me cry. She's an amazing and talented singer!
I really wish Billie’s mic was a little louder but it is still beautiful
okkkk dis ate
Aguante Catriel y Paco!!!
Ela é incrível 😻
some of these trolls in these comments are unbearable.. losers
People watch and listen to this with ads!?
angel voice
Beautiful! And Finneas deserve a Tiny Desk too. The last album its awesome.
My gosh this is so magical.
It just got better.. and better..          and better..
They are the new Carpenters
What’s with the perm bros in the back?
L
So wonderful. Wholesome beautiful  talents.
Such an incredible talent OMG I LOVE HER SO MUCH
jehu christopher, absolute artistry. beautiful energy. P.S. dear ombudsman,  please send an invitation to SLAYER.
please bring ariana grande into this
The drummer is so chill and unfazed. I love it 😂
one of the few pop artists whose voice is identical to their recorded songs sound-wise, so talented.
bravo🎉
I got an ad in the middle of EVERY SONG!! do better YouTube!!
I have a crush on Andrew.
so moving and beautiful to see Billie blossom into full womanhood and artistry; also the bond between these two is healing to watch
9:43 her voice control is INSANE
I have no words
I would always want to live in a billie eilish world
Saw her in 2018 at a small venue in Boston for $25 before she had released her first album. Crazy to see how much her voice has evolved and how far she’s come.
Wow this was f'n amazing!
Over rated...sorry
havent forgetten about the narduar interview
Acoustic Mtv - BiLLIE eILISH
This tiny concert make everybody so close with the singer who wore like a students uniform but her voices make me like "IN" into her song❤❤❤❤
Weird Unsocialized Homeschoolers for the win.  Honestly, her vocal quality is so fluid and satisfying and lovely, it's just a joy to listen to. Couple that with the songwriting and arranging, and performances, and I am so happy to be able to see and hear this wonderfulness!  Thank you Billie, Finneas, and everyone!  What a treat!
just cancelled my sub
❤
why she has so many cuts and bruises? 😢
No. way.
cakep bgt mba billie pake baju gini
i didn’t work because of my wifi?
I'm just divorced. her family didn't like me and they pushed it. i needed her to fight back, but she didn't, so they took her away. the worst part is realizing that she actually didn't love me as much as i did. so many happy moments are left behind like it's nothing. i'm still trying to ease the regrets and the shame of being lied to all this time, oh yes, she's childish and she's a huge liar. no hate, just facts
11:56
15:54 the way fin is staring at her 🥺🤍 making sure she doesn’t cry
Las risas son tan sitcom fkdkkd asi se reiran los gringos??
Wouw we can enjoy this music indeed even they presented with a simple way but still the package make me so happy ❤❤❤❤
so beautiful.
Accidentally found this while looking for the TDE Christmas concert. A very welcome surprise lol  The COVID one was really good too
The drummer was facing so much adversity, sheesh! Curls all on the cymbals is just a lot
I love that she looks so much like the middle Lawrence brother
Her voice is so unreal, like I can't describe it
it's regardless to the concert but she looks so fine here
Temazo i love you hasta el fin de los tiempos
As a drummer his rod sticks stuck out, complimented the volume of the band perfectly. Brother sister duo reaching new heights. Insanely impressive. Their discipline to maintain feel while controlling volume is so good. Props to the piano player
Pov: cant sing with eyes open lol
I’m living for the minimalistic approach 🔥💙💙🤷🏽‍♂️
Qué locura!
Es que se ve preciosaaaaaa
TRUE talent, vocals, musicians, writing - thank you! 💙✨️🥂
Apakah benar jika Billie Eilish berasal dari Kota Nganjuk?
te amo billie💟
Es una locura tan bonita ❤️‍🩹😭✨
que bello sentir el que tiene Billie, y que manera de transmitirlo <3
eu morri com i love you
amazing,  we dont deserve this woman
this made me a fan.  Love the rawness
La amo tanto 😍😢
Now i need Clairo
Please do Clyde and Gracie from Lawrence next!!!
In heaven with this calming my brain.
hermoso tiny desk <3 los amo Billie y Finneas
woowowooww obsessed.
He is playing a 200$ orangewood acoustic. That is killer ❤
She knocks it out of the park every time I see her anywhere
The first time that I've seen a tiny desk concert posted recently im usually late to watch these 🥴
QUE PERFEIÇÃO, MEU DEUSSSSSSS! COME TO BRAZIL, COME TO RECIFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE <3
The Carpenters of this generation. ❤
Need a jazz album
TMDWU BILLIE UHLIEGE
My favorite vampire 🥰
18:52 the piano players face has me cracking up I love it 😂😂 I LOVE YOU BILLIE 🤎🤎🤎
Surprised this doesnt have more views
"The greatest" OMGGG
Finneas lowkey annoying, bro wants to be included in everything Billie does.  We wanna hear Billie, not u butting in trying to get some spotlight
Danggg Finneas you're sooo hotttttttt. and Billie she sounds even better than the recording. IMMM DYINGGGG I LOVE THEMMMM SMMM
You are an incredible woman, I love you Bibi❤
I so long for more rock band acoustic
The engineer(s) that made this sound so good WITH drums right in the middle is my hero.
So bad why get her on
Meh I'm not a fan of the soft stuff. I prefer the upbeat tempo from the songs on her debut album.
King of convenience <3
Apologize to Trump or your career is over. Go Woke go broke.
Her brother looks like Brian Adams when he was young. <3
Ooh a new tiny desk concert it must be Christmas!
The way Finneas gave her the entire room while being her rock through the nerves with just his look was magical. What a pair of talents.
I’m gonna watch this 50 times, I just know it.
Se cancela escuchar cualquier otra cosa que no sea este Tiny🫀🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
I love you in her mature voice ✨️chills
Interesting type of job. Different than the people who work on cars for a living but just as important.
i love herrrrr
Tiny desk is one of the best places to figure out if this is or is not for you
FINNEAS+Billie= Artistic duo we never knew we needed that we’d appreciated
Tatuaje en el cuello?
She has such a beautiful voice
Hoping this is the last Tiny Desk of the year - cause God knows the miss you have had
omg finally
“& we don’t have to fight  When it’s not worth fighting for” Had me shooooooook  I just broke up 3 days ago It hurts but I’ve never been happier? 😮‍💨
❤❤
Beautiful job!❤
This is an insult
Absolutely love Tiny Desk from Nepal 🇳🇵
i hope one day you guys will invite AGNEZ MO
Very Billie to be so nervous shes shaking and then proceed to give us the best Tiny Desk of all time
why is she so out of tune?
Tiny desk work OVERTIME THIS YEAR 🎉🎉❤
This is one of my favorite tiny desks
Ive always been a fan but i never fully tapped in.  I would just hear her radio stuff and always thought she was cool.  This blew me away right here.  Her voice is amazing and ahe definitely takes her craft serious.
She rally sucks live lol
14:19 theyre always in sync
😍😍😍
this would be so much better if Finneas wasn't singing. I wish it was pure billies vocal
i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Zzzzzz
This is AMAZING ❤
CANT BELIEVE SHE SANG I LOVE YOU?!?! JUST RELISTENED TO IT YESTERDAY OMFG QWEEN
Are these versions on Spotify?
Betterhelp is such a gross sponsor. C'mon npr, do better.
this format was so perfect to showcase billie's talent and delicate vocals! absolutely loved it
the way she says “LuhIFE” in lamour de la vie tickles my brain
I’ll be congratulating them when they can get REN (independent artist) on there…Good luck with that.
🩵
I love Billie and Finneas
Serious talent here. Also, she has PERFECT LIPS 😻
muchooooo mejor que paco amoroso!!!! qué calidad, qué humaidad!
Te amo Billie
WOW!!
Nothing short of brilliant
Billie is thee most humble and genuine artist ever ❤
Languid perfomance
The cute face when she sing❤
Billie is a dream that as a from underprivileged household every kid wanted to live.. Thank u billie for showing that it is possible❤ love u so much
❤❤
🩵
the way finneas looks at billie durng i love you just shows how proud of her he is
Omggg.. 🥺❤️‍🔥
maravilhosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
FINNEAS is such a great role model to her, he is so proud, they read each other so well. Just look how he stares at her
Melody  Gardot please ❤️
Bellísimo a más no poder. Pero sin peros ¿podría alguien decirme por qué me hubiera encantado que cante junto con la Negra Sosa? ¿No hubiese sido el mejor dúo de nunca jamás?
Todo bien pero el Tiny de Ca7riel y Paco estuvo mejor ampliamente 🇦🇷💪🏻
si hubiesen sido todos los temas como el ultimo, hubiese estado bueno
15:20 got me dead 💀 lol
Goosebumps always
NPR i have watched The Marías  unplugged and now Billie my fav singer... Thank u
Her music is so slow and depressing. She also looks like she's not even trying or maybe trying to whisper into the mic lol I am so confused by her as an artist. No negativity, just saying.
Billie is so amazing! Love the softer jazzier versions too! But anything she does is great 🥰
Lovely! 🙏🏽
Wildflower should’ve been on here 😢😢😢
first time ?
ya I clicked instantly.. obviously
kok bentar bangetttt huhuhuu nangiissss😭
Does the acoustic guitar he plays on the first song has a rubber bridge or something?
Now in can  sleep. Thanks! <3
I loved every song!!! ..Beautiful!
Por finnnnnnn❤❤❤❤❤
I want to say this tiny desk concert was good but not better than chappel roan
BILLIE AND IVANNNN WOULD BE HEATTTTTT❤❤❤❤
eu te amo
birds of a feather didnt go #1
ZZZZZZZZZZ
Her make up is perfect here. This color of her hair suits her ❤
Epic❤
basura
That was too short :(
Since Copycat album i know this girl will be a super artist 🫶🏻
imagine dragons when?
tiny desks are just a tv channel now, ewgh. unsuscribing
Crying this is so beautiful. I’m 28 and I love Billie her voice is perfection .  my daughter is 9  and she loves Billie as well ❤
It really is beautiful to see the way finneas looks at Billie while she sings, he has so much love and admiration in his eyes. He knows the absolute raw talent that Billie has and is always ready to life her up and support her. I’m obsessed that they share this together. 😭💕
Magical 😢❤
She can’t sing
Come to Brazil!!
Watching her go from Ocean Eyes to this has been an absolute privilege and journey.
Canta hermoso, talentosisimaaaa, pero la única canción que me gusta billie es birds of feather 😫💔🔥
They opened this with my favorite song of Hit Me Hard And Soft?!!!! I’m crying already
PLEASE INVITE JAMES ARTHUR HERE😭
Pure genius.  Thank you and Namaste.
she really s  the  greatest
Cringe... 🤢🤢🤢
THIS IS SO COOL!  I'M CRYING!!!😭😭😭
Gonna nickname this series “NPR unplugged” as an homage to old school mtv unplugged (still remember the alanis morrisette unplugged like it was yesterday”)   luv this tiny desk format—it’s so approachable and inspiring. thank u NPR for keeping us inspired with new and established artists. Plz release these on vinyl and downloadable.
Am I the only who is hearing 'Wasting your time' by Booka600 During The Greatest
her voice is so flexible it sounds so effortless
this might be the best thing i have ever witnessed
My God. I never realized....!
Can I like this a million times?
Underwhelmed, tbh. I had high hopes.
Billy Sings
love seein billie use more and more of her voice instead of just whisper. dont get me wrong the whisper tones and texture igreat, but her voice is showing more and more and im all heer for it !
So good…..submerged me in emotion😊😊😊
Beautiful.....except the YouTube commercials in the middle of songs just killed the brilliance of the music
Ending with “Birds of a Feather” right after the very sad “I Love You” was such a GREAT choice
we love billie 💙
i've never cried so much in such a short video
This is great.  Her brother really deserves a successful solo career as well so the fact there is no jealousy and envy is refreshing to see
Never thought i will fall in love again... With... Life... Music... U name it!!!
MIAUUUU MIAUUUUU MIAUUUU MIAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
te amo billie dios casate conmigo
Not performing “Wildflower” is criminal
I listened to this and felt so happy to be alive, what an incredible voice she has 😢
Im not a massive billie Eilish fan and havent heard some of these songs before. Looking them up these versions are better than the originals.
She’s just so pretty 😭
I almost broke my thumb clicking this 😂😂😂
i need these versions on spotify omg
Sexiest voice alive
20min have never passed so fast, I need a 3h version of this
I LOVE YOU?? 😭
Aww her voice is so beautiful
I'm convinced she's a CIA plant after this one. Unbelievably mid compared to her popularity
I think they could have squeezed a couple more people back there
The third song when  you said old one , I already knew that it would be ❤ . Thank you guys very much for what you’re doing here on my phone )) .  I listening you so much , that my favourite songs is always one of the last songs. You’re really great part of my life . ❤
Being so dead fr, I think that song (Birds Of A Feather) just went number 1 cause of me cause I just recently was on it heavy 😭🤭
Broo this fire the real fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
Insane
what happened to leaving the country and never coming back?
Tiny Desk sound engineers never miss. Not once. Not ever.
This made me so very happy.
like porque es billie eilish
listening to THE GREATEST: Acoustic while reading this beautiful youtube description made me sigh and crinkle, "hopeful regret" is perfect to say it
Clearly, she has a lot of talent, but I think this is the first time I am a Billie Eilish fan. Wish she would do more simplistic things and have her voice as the main.
I would love to go to a tiny desk concert to see billie eilish 😢😭😭😭
I’m luvin her brother‘s new music also 💫💙✨
don't b afraid 2 put out the deluxe billie 🫧
"I love you" is amazing as an acoustic performance!
Finally!
The duration is short
❤❤❤❤blilie elilish ❤
not even playing chihiro massive L
I'm cryiiinggg😭 I just love herrrr💗
que mujer por favorrrrrRr teamo Billieeeeeeeeeeee
Please bring Anitta ❤
¿Tatuaje en el cuello?
I cry EVERY TIME she sings I Love You. Every. F*cking. Time.  Imma.mess 😭😭😭
SOOO GOOOODDDDDD, I LOVEEEE HERRRR
I think a tear 😢 came out 😘😘Bravo Bravo
I mean how incredible is her voice
Can you imagine if billie Eilish and Kat Dennings had a kid🥺
Why billie knees always beat up?😂.
Curti antes de ver pq sim
SAUDADE
i’m so in love bruh
❤ i listen to the interview of this tiny desk on npr news radio at work and i have never heard Billie just speak. That’s  a great interview to listen to how they are doing in the audio industry and touring without each other.
TE AMO BILLIE X TI RESPIRO
Not good.
Está aburrido 👎🏾
18:53 every one thinks of me with this song. 🤙
Some people are just born talented. Goosebumps after that first song
i love you girl, omg
DAY 1 KENDRICK LAMAR TINY DESK! LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN
21st Century Joni Mitchell
🫶🫶
DIRTY
Jaja justo le IVA a mandar eso jajaja
Billieeeeeeeeeeeee ❤❤❤❤❤
love this but wildflower definitely should be on here 😭😭
she sings with her eyes closed the whole time except when she talks
the best video in whole social media!!!!!!
please guys call shawn mendes to tiny desk
I forgot about i love you, good song
So amazing. Incredible voice!
Omg
Que lindo hubiera sido escuchar a Amy Winehouse en este formato..😢
Y'all, please go read the video description, it is GORGEOUS.
Criminal having midroll ads on this video
Billie > Taylor Swift, dont get the Taylor hype, Billies vocals are so raw and good its crazy
I heard her mentioning how taking voice lessons has helped her and as a fan from day one i concur. She's amazing. I love her and Finneas both.
the audio engineers were amazing on this! thank you ❤
Literalmente un ángel cantando
Goosebumps. Beautiful ❤
Never was a big fan. After that I'm a fan 🔥
Outfit confirms KSI feature
<3
Lovelovelove
Orangewood!
YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
So good.
How do people not get bored of her singing? It's a snooze fest here. 😂
everytime she plays I love you I feel like i’ve been put in a trance. wish she played it on tour for my city
Can you please play the ads between the songs?  Pretty please! 😊
She's an absolute powerhouse, a generational, worldly talent.
Her fans are wild.  I dont think she makes bad music... but she's not a great singer... sorry if that hurts your feelings... but listen to pretty much any other vocalist on tiny desk lol
Xoxo
11:26 the reference to their previous tiny desk concerttt omg:)
O finneas olhando ela 🫶🏼
Finneas and Billie's vocals sound so good together in an acoustic setting. Amazing guests as usual Tiny Desk team, keep it up.
billie is a vocalist through and through and she just keeps getting better. shes a living legend
Billie and Finneas you made the best song ❤
Wonderful singer to listen to. In a relaxed manner. I think Bob James and his band has been in Thiny Desk. Also nice to listen to.Greetings from Norway.
Estos i son TD
Tiny desk needs to make the shows into auto like colors for streaming.
am i the only one who found this boring...
The worst tiny desk I ever seen
❤❤❤
Woooow Billie has an angelic voice, every time hear she music it it's so relaxing.......
perdón pero me re dormí, un aburrimiento..
Cómo te amo Billie <33
love their outfits 👌🏻
They sounds like The Civil Wars here
Estoy tan orgullosa de mi niña 😊❤
4:54 me and who but like in a romantic way and not like a brother and sister way
Vabbè, altri pianeti
The way Fineas, look Billie is ... like brother love and admiration . TY for this Unplugged
헐..❤
And that’s it?? It should be a 7 hour concert 😢
I don't get it she's so boring and the music is so soulless and try hard 😂 Never saw the appeal of this broad there are 1000 girls online just as good or better no originality
JUST 4 SONGS??? ARE YOU CRAZY😢😢😢
dios, la amo tanto😭❤
One of the only things that could distract me from the state of things right now.
birds of a feather
I could listen to Billie sing all day 💫
Think I might be alone here but I don't think she is all that talented as a musician. Perhaps this video isn't reflective enough of her albums. I feel like the vocals were forced to be all moody and full of inflections that didn't make much sense.
CÓMO NO VA A CANTAR CHIHIRO 😢
the best.
I’d give an arm to get a ticket to one of these things
Estos son 2 chorros
Gorgeous!
I got 3x tickets for tonight show. Can't make the trip tonight anyone ready for the grab
Just realised that Billie is the female version of Jeff Buckley!
Wow! This format really suits her voice. I think I'm a new fan!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💪🏽
She’s glowing. Love you Billie ❤️
The thing I love about Billie is she can actually sing. So many singers do not sound good live. She’s the one of the greats!! 💜
She did I love you 😍 ( I did it on the voice France) check my performance ❤️ love u
I thought Brids of a Feather could not make me cry harder but i was wroooong
Billllliiiiee❤❤❤❤❤
this is unbelievably mid, she has a incredibly beautiful voice but i’m not a fan of her songwriting
I dont get why people say Billie cant sing,this is probably the most i ever seen her live and honestly shes really good.
Not a cut out this time xD
L’Amour makes me wonder if Billie went through my 2011 divorce? 🤪🤪🤪 My favorite on her album!
The way finneas looks at her like wow thats literally my sister ☹️🩷🩷 love them both !!💕
I love Billie and I am still a little concerned she might beat Mac's
That piano is too nice🥶
Hermosisisimo es un paraíso escuchar a Billie ❤❤❤❤❤
Her voice is Beautyfull and she too
Chills as soon as she opened her mouth! Omg 🤩
My favorite person ever. Billie ❤
20:08 😊
I don’t listen to Billie but that first song hits different
That was the fastest 22 mins ever!
She looks pretty
These minimalistic versions are the best! Imagine what her concerts could be like, without everyone screaming.
Her voice sounds better with no autotune no ofence  ❤ love you billie cant belive your turning 23 in five days
These ad placements are criminal
♥
This is up there with the Mac Miller one.
I feel so honored to breath the same air as her thank you Billie and Finneas
<3 <3 <3
Omgggg❤
Wow her voice is just so beautiful
This is it. This is the point where we get artists that may have grown up watching these NPR concerts. it means more to them because the name has been a big part of the live music scene. I love seeing young artists go out and give their all in these, its in my opinion better than their actual records. (I love her records by the way)
Billy should tell more stories about what the illuminutti had her do for Fame and Fortune
Esquire Eilish Bravo!!!
Insanely talented
NPR needs to get a tiny desk LP out with the great songs sang by the greatest artists including Billie, Harry, Taylor and Dua just to name a few. Would bring so much donation money not even funny! 😮
Not many things would have me smiling for 20 minutes straight but this full thing I was cheesing
I love this. The Tiny Desk At Home she did during lockdown was what convinced me to listen to her. She's brilliant.
Love tiny desk... But man... Billie Eilish CANNOT SING... very flat and lifeless to me. Notes just devoid of feeling. Seems like a great girl, but not a strong artist by any stretch.
the vocal harmonies are incredible
I would love to hear her cover hallelujah
I didn't know Billie Eilish from Billy Ocean two days ago.  It's extremely rare I find anything recent that doesn't make me question values but she isn't the usual talentless eye candy or trap beat garbage.  This is quite pleasant.
man get Eric Andre off the drums
Hey NPR, lets start shooting Tiny Desk Concerts in 4K. Okay thanks bye
Yessss I love her always wondered how her raw vocals are and it's as good as I imagined 😭 thank you NPR
The last time I heard “I love you” Billy was in a tiny venue no more than 40 people completely silent such a pure an unforgettable moment. Just breathtaking 😊
Finneas has a crush on Billy
como pode alguém ser assim pqp
Overrated garbage
LOL. She sure has a lot of fans. Geez. Listen to that applause.
why you laugh a lot? she don´t said nothing funny, people.
She's so amazing!! And Fin. . Yes! Chefs kiss
Such a talented young lady!
❤
Billie after Doechii is crazy NPR 😂 please get off our necks!!!
Amazing, now we need Finneas Tiny!!!
Where's the moew moew moew moew? 😭
انا بحبك يا نجمة
As a native Portuguese speaker, I appreciated your effort to explain what 'Saudade' means. Yes, Eilish's performance in this Tiny Desk is full of Saudade in her voice.
PLEASE STOP YOUR BETTER HELP/HEALTH SPONSPRSHIP!! THEY ARE VERY BAD NEWS!!! At least look into them??! Very uncool.

Sevdah on the American Way. Perfect! Love you from Sarajevo!
Billie... you cant keep taking my body away...
I watched this an embarrassing amount of times
Enjoy it now because anti-American leftist lunatic media like NPR will be shut down in the near future with necessary budget cuts. Tiny desk is a great series but way too much anti-American leftist propaganda on NPR. It’s deplorable truly deplorable. 👀🙏⚖️🗽🇺🇸
This is in fact the best new medium. Also, Billie and Phineas are kind of brilliant.
Absolutely beautiful!!❤❤❤
This version of the greatest is so much better than the album version omg
whoever on twitter said that finneas looks like a turtle, I do not want to admit that you were right
I had no idea she was this talented.  Thanks Tiny Desk for adding a new fan.
I needed this to be 3 hours long
I wasn't certain before, but now I am. She's as average as it gets.
Im waiting for meowcmeow
Hilarious ❤💚
II
Sublime
Superb sound engineering
Artista demais
Why does she always sound like that?  Amazing I mean.
I would check everyday to see when billie would pop up... the day has come. thank you tiny desk.
Colombian flag in the background 🥹🇨🇴❤️
Define perfection this is it 🩵🩵🩵
HER VOICE DURING L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 😭😭😭
i love you 11:53
Get this diddy party witch off my feed.
omg i love billie so much IM CRYING
starting with the greatest, then l'amour, then I LOVE YOU?? then birds of a feather the saddest happy song which is actually about abandonment issues??!!! oh shes taking me thru the stages of heartbreak today
The voice of our generation👏 You will be my love forever❤️‍🔥
❤❤❤
billie pick me up
Bravo!
She didn't dress like a girl, she went minimalist and should make that her brand, she looks amazing!
Tatuaje en el cuello?
💚💚💚💚
Finally I get to hear her…..love the tiny desk!
Incredible audio recording and mix. Well done Tiny Desk.
I started sobbing when she starting singing I love you 😭😭😭 I love her so much ❤️
i dont want it to end i dont want it to end i dont want it to end i want it to end
Love the description - Saudade - i finally have a word to put to this.
What a great singer Finneas is, supports her so well!  Kudos to having a brother with the talent to allow his sister to blossom.
I love her.
Why billie changed her whole hip hop outfit style only for this performance?? Btw incredible talent
They are so talented
I feel like only real artist do a tiny desk concert because they are confident enough to show their skills
Please let be Lana del rey next 🙏
I've always loved this Queen. But her first song brought tears to my eyes. Omg I love her voice. 😍 She's so authentic and raw!!! I'm pretty certain that's why I feel the way I do about her. ❤❤
I love billie ❤
She has the most hauntingly beautiful voice. Absolutely wonderful performance!
i've always loved you but this year you really did something to my soul. THANK YOU<3
billie <33 I love you so much.
Sobbing
She’s so talented and pretty 💅🏼🤍
素敵な歌声をありがとう
The way Finneas looks at her with so much admiration 😭
I really like the acoustic arrangement of Birds of a Feather, really catchy also how she sings it
Great job!  Love that you guys were exposed to, and continue to be influenced by great artists that all generations should continue to listen to.  Congrats on the Tiny Desk.  Quote below from a related interview on NPR.  EILISH: It - for sure. It's definitely reminiscent of jazz standards and the kind of world of music that I - Finneas and I really did grow up a lot on and really admire. And I've just always been such a fan of all things, you know, jazz. And, you know, Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee and Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan and - you know, the list goes on. But, like, those are my singing inspirations and lyric inspirations and melody. I mean, all of those chords and the melodies are just so, like, astounding and unpredictable, and I really look for that in music. And with this song, I really wanted it to feel like the unpredictable kind of melodic turns that those jazz standards kind of give.
REEEEINAAAAAAAA!!!!!
La belleza de la sencillez ❤
I love you billie Eilish
18:20 what you came for
Goosebumps ahhh
Why is that guy singing??
OMGGGGG Love it. They did a Tiny Desk Home Concert but I am glad they finally came to the deskkkk
🦋🧵🎞️❤️‍🔥⚡️🎟️✌🏼🎟️⚡️❤️‍🔥🎞️🧵🦋
perfect songs for me right now. billie is my emotional support through this rough time im going through.
My only complaint is that this isn’t long enough :(
Made w fan outta me.  ❤
I love the way she still can annunciate while in her falsetto. She sings “the greatest” so clearly
Saudade... We all feel it. ❤
She’s so talented and beautiful I love her so much 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Incredibleee
❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
Wow❤
Pensé que era Nicki Nicole❤
Incredible performance. She is an angel singing
SHE PLAYED I LOVE U 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 gets me everytimeeee
I never realized how hard Birds of a feather is to sing live. Dang. They're so lovely these two. So talented. 🥰 I feel like my ears just got some warm honey.
Idk man, the yodeling song would have been fire
The man on the piano is unconsciously paying tribute to Rowlf.
the way i sobbed at i love you
Extreme talented definitely underrated Ballads. She was just in San Jose and hella peoples was camping iut cuz it was GA.. but she lookn different Ozempic, surgery or clone?😂
Thank you tiny desk for that magnicifant
Have never really liked Billie Eilish but thought i'd give the tiny desk concert a chance, and boy was i blown away! The instruments here are great, the guitar mixing with the piano and of course the drums and bass. Finneas' voice is amazing and of course so is hers. 10/10
MAGA 2024
Totally unrelated, but Tyler Childers would be an awesome guest to have ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The way Finneas look at her sister... Admiration and pride. What a great duo. Thanks to mom and dad.
Q bendición
Finally a real tiny desk from her hahhaa
I’m so giddy about this, this is so exciting and incredible to watch 😭 I love how she always calls us beautiful it’s so sweet
Wow🥺
She's not just good, she's excellent. Her lyrics are incredible and her vocals are astonishing! I already liked her, but her latest album made me a fan.
💛🔥
Let’s be honest she doesn’t sing very well
Those blue ocean eyes...
bring Matuê to tiny desk pls
great drumming on the last song!
não sabia que o @cogumelando tocava com a billie 🤩🥰
Finneas is the GREATEST musician and producer of our time.
I swear her vocals are the best 😭😭😭😭😭
the cutest band ever!!
✨✨
What no blaccent today?
Más de lo mismo nada nuevo, en esta joven y creativa Joven.
6:43
Whata voice to pair with those strings.
wildflower 😭😭😭😭😭
them playing i love you hit me like a million bricks. i’m the same age as billie so this song meant a lot to me as a teenager
To depressiva que esse video tem fim
Billie's and Finneas' voices compliment eachother so well
Gotta let the homies know I fw this.
My boyfriend told me he played along to this last night. I could hear so much space they leave for other musicians in the beginning... So pretty. Thank you Billie and Finnie and apologies I don't know the other musicians names. ♥️
She is just an angel 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙❤❤❤I love this sm this is amazing
we need sza
I think Chappell Roan's Tiny Desk ruined me because it's so energetic and theatrical that this one (and most others I've watched since) seem so...boring? Underwhelming? No doubt Billie and her bro are very talented musicians, but doing a Tiny Desk like this requires just a little bit of pizzaz as well, and it's sorely lacking here. Maybe because she had to get up so early?
Billie e Finneas sempre arrasam, é indiscutivel que eles são perfeitos juntos
Hands up if you had an audible reaction at 6:46 LOVE IT
Esta piba no tiene sentido, que lo solicite
😨 Oh My Gosh
She is such a legend
Дуже гарно!
trash
I need this set pressed to vinyl.
GIVE HER ALL THE GRAMMYSSSSSSSS
What mics are those pencils? Rode NTG1? Thanks!
This is pretty boring
For me it’s the brother sister relationship they’ve got going on always together it’s so beautiful 🤧🤧
Thank you ☀️
I don’t care she supported Kamala Harris, I love her
Wat do you mean it’s her first tiny desk
This version of The Greatest is pure fire. Needs to be a single.
The Greatest = Give You Blue by Allen Stone
Then amount of ads on this is insane.
Why do they sound like a Devendra Banhart cover session 🤯
Can we do Slipknot next?
Why I’m crying??? Soo GOOOOD! Love it!!!
She’s sooo good 💯
Billie is truly an anomaly. Exceptional. Rare artist of the new millennium. Unconventional. Raw. Talent. FULL STOP ✋️.  Her artistry helps me to write.💞
章鱼巴在柱子上
15:20 you're welcome
Pqp! Nao estava preparada para essa versao de “I love you” 😫
A truly authentic gen Z artist🇺🇸
make it with Tyla!!!
this dude actually ruins the backvocal in birds of feather
Já tô chorando... uma voz profunda, que emociona, que encanta!
El mejor Tiny Desk, Billie siempre logra hacer nuevas sus canciones y regalarnos un momento mágico 🫶🏻
the note change in I love you has me sobbing
She’s so talented such a beautiful voice
This is beautiful, along with all other Tiny Desk episodes🤝🏽🔥
Thanks tiny desk! Great job Billie, Finny, and bandmates. The authenticity and vulnerability is impeccable.
Those vocal mics are trash
i love her so much // goosebumps . crying . admiring . listening to her lyrics and how she tells a story through her voice .. incredible x10 i love tdc
Name of first song?
I like the talk singing on birds of a feather x
she so angelical
This generation’s Richard and Karen Carpenter
I'd love to see Billie and Phineas  tackle some of the greatest jazz vocals.  She has some much "feeling" in her voice.
Billie you are the best, I actually love that you did this after the cardboard covid one I listened to a thousand times!
so much love
hearing the greatest with out the background production is wild! what a vocally challenging song
❤
If I wasn’t a fan im a fan now! I didn’t know she could actually sang!
such a pretty voice
i dont know if billie or finneas see these commets or anything but birds of a feather is my favourite song just sounds like your leaving a depression and ive found that person that i love till the day that i die
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I prefer this version of the greatest ❤ so soft
‏‪15:14‬‏ she definitely has stressed
FINALLYYYY!!!! I’ve been waiting for the GOATs to come on tiny desk
Te amo, Billie 🇨🇱
IT is so interesting to me that their parents only let them stay up late if they were using it for talents especially music. Shows that if you let kids express and practice their talents and give them space they will make something incredible. I admit as an adult I am pretty addicted to screens but giving kids the tools and letting them express themselves even with devices a lot of the time something amazing will come.
please consider a different sponsor. betterhelp is really not good for people with mental health issues
She giving Mac Miller vibes love them both
which microphones are used for voice?
Loved it! My only complaint is that it was too short
Sad to see the better help ads they’re a predatory company and you shouldn’t support them
I was hoping for wild flower
Love it but she is subdued.
I think this is the loudest I’ve ever heard the crowd in one of these
The BEST 🩷✨
i love billie
I really really really love their intimate acoustic sets
Finding a drummer who will use a variety of cool-roddy soft sticks is an achievement in itself.
She is SO good, literally so many emotions come to me when listening to her 😢❤
Beautiful work ❤
“This is my brother by the way” 😂 they don’t seem to know their fame level it’s cute
19:44 Can't this man be quiet? He ruins the song.
Certified GOAT. Top 5 female singer all time prove me wrong
This concert is so amazing, her have a angelical voice.
So sad it lasts only 22 minutes...
It’s a beautiful!!!
What is your favorite song of this tiny desk ?
Não dá pra entender como essa mulher alcança tanto ibope...é bom, mas não achei grandes coisas...
i love you foi pra mim!!!!!!
errou no termo saudade ligado a essa apresentação hein
That " I Love You" was superb!
BetterHelp? Eww
Oh my god this is awesome, great Billie and Phineas 👏🏻❤️
Where is the bass?????
Im so happy!!! Finally! Billie is so talented
o melhor até hoje.
🧡anyone here In 2025
Man her voice is amazing
gosh it was brilliant!! i had goosebumps all over my body!
omg marry me
Mesmerizing talent.
I was waiting for What was I made for
Não deve ter graça para os músicos que a acompanham.  Quase não podem tocar seus instrumentos
Her brother creeps me out.  Hope it is not a Carpenters situation.
Bring Daniel Caesar again…and Frank
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. @NPRMusic is a GIFT to this world. And so is B. E. !!!
Unreal vocals.
A M O!
I LOVE U MENTIONED
DO MKGEE!!!!!!PLEASE!!!!!!
3 out of 4 songs from HMHAS? c'mon
Kinda disappointed she isn’t dressed like Biggie Smalls.
Very cool of her to go on here
This is where I discovered Aurora ages ago. Now seeing Billie here is a lovely full circle as Aurora inspired her in part to launch her solo career.
Beautiful. Thank you.
Incredible honestly. I'm short for words
Finneas’ finger picking is sooo clean. Great tone.
Вау ти така красатулька!!, батькам привітання!
if any male artist hated women as much as billy hates men, they wouldnt be invited to do a tiny desk 🤡🤡
Angelic voice and face ❤
8:27 omfgggggg
i knew the 2nd half of L'AMOUR DE MA VIE wasnt gonna happen but still sad it didnt
My heart dropped when I heard her say I love you then I started crying while she was singing 😭❤
Bravooooo baby girl ✨✨✨✨✨
Please look into better help and stop giving them such a huge platform time after time..
this isn't what I expected from billie but it wasn't bad just meh, some very pretty moments though
Does anyone knows if there's an app, a Tiny Desk App, where i can download this amazing stuff? Thanx.
hermoso😪
I love when she sings the Ariana Grande song ❤
I Love You is literally one of my favorite songs in this world.  thank you🤍
NPR UNPLUGGED ;-)
Kind of stopped caring when she made those Kamala shill endorsements. Sickening.
it should be criminal to put ads in the middle of something like this
Please make a vinyl like the Mac miller concert 🙏
her singing i love you... i am unwell...
Los Tiny desk de Billie Elish , dan sensación de vació de que falto algo, como que falta ruido , pero no en el buen sentido
Excepcional!
Brought me tears. First song
Unreal… beautiful music … thanks guys 🙏🏻
Why Finneaa have to be there?
What a treat this is!🎼👍
te amo bebita
jajajaja ahora entiendo porque fue mi artista del año en spotify, la amo es lo máximo Billie que voz que tiene.
“meow meow meow” is awesome! Who is here in 2024 after listening to "meow meow meow"?
sweet❤
ya’ll have no idea how much the note change in i love you affects me.
We need a @kimbramusic Tiny Desk
Bro, I was waiting for this for years :( Finally. ❤
Finneas is an under rated musician
The way her brother looks up at her during this song, i love you., to support her silently while she’s expressing emotion is just gut wrenching and heartwarming at the same time.
Love Joy Peace 🌺🍃🌸🍃🌺🌱🌹✨✨✨✨✨✨💫
Studio version same as tiny desk version. Too good
I love music so much, after loosing my father i would sit in my living room couch ..lights off no tv or music and just drink till inknocked out.. I now see that my world had crumbled. Took me 5 years to recover. But as i sit here and watch this, i can now enjoy it. I wasnt a fan or knew much of her but thanks to you guys shes got a new fan.
Tears were shed 🥺
FINALLY
Danm she can sing
i felt so good was watching this little concert :) thanks guys
This was amazing. Shout out to @thesuavesolo
the sound quality is SO GOOD my god
bring Rosalia
Thank you better help Thank you NPr Music Thank you Billie Eilish
Pure gold
excited for her grammy
My all time favorite song from the album. So relatable , so painful. So raw how she can just speak from her experience & the way it aligns with me… and so many other fans. Incredible.
Im so glad she got a second opportunity for a tiny desk concert! She deserves it!
keys player is so tasteful! and as always, the mix is insanely good!
GIYAT DIYEM BROK!

Amo su voz 🙌🏽
JORDYN ARE YOU IN THIS COMMENTS ??

The love of my life, Billie

Her playing i love you is like omg. You dont get it. She is my everything
miau miau miau miaaaau
I am unwell
MARAVILHOSA TE AMO  MINHA RAINHA  MUSA DO VERÃO
I love all things Tiny Desk.  I know a few Billie Eilish songs but watching this will have me adding a few more to my play list.
YESSSSSSSSS
Billie always makes me fall in love with music more❤
All "pop" music should pass through the tiny desk test...show your raw talent, or fade away! I need a coffee shop tiny desk playlist!
ı cant over them
She didn’t dress like a boy, sick.
i love u so much Billie!!!
Fascinante 💙
Thanks for this, she is supreme, her energy is so cute and soft. Simply amazing, it was time for a real tiny desk ✨🔥❤️
why is this so brief
Oh my god the HARMONIES
this is bananas
billie’s outfit really match with her voice💙
Sooooo cuteeeee 😍😍😍😍😍 "im nervous" sooooo Pretty baby
Te he amado desde el primer día que te encontré en 2017, gracias por todo Billie
She's an enchantment. <3
Te he amado desde el primer día que te encontré en 2017, gracias por todo Billie
Te he amado desde el primer día que te encontré en 2017, gracias por todo Billie
she tooks me far.. great !
It's crazy how so many people think she can't sing, or that she overuses autotune to cover up how she can't sing, she's always had an amazing voice.
parece que vc canta pra mim né. aí Billie vamo num parque ficar se balançando enquanto o sol se põe, tô cansado de tudo.
Qué deleite poder escuchar a Billie 😌🎧❤
No she didn’t!!!! Gah, Billie you’re so cool
❤❤❤❤❤
Ugh as soon as I love you started playing my eyes welled up
Stop collaborating with betterhelp
8:28 this part of the song reminded me of Amy Winehouse.
😍😍😍😍😍
Those runs, I am healed
I think she needs to do a colab with Sia...
pa cuando la de finneas
0:31 THE GREATEST  6:46 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:54 I LOVE YOU 18:27 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
21:17 ALTERNATE LYRICS LETS GOOO
I love you Billie, your album Hit Me Hard And Soft save my life ❤
The sheer amount of raw talent this woman possesses 🤯. She deserves every Grammy she was nominated for and more ❤❤❤ wish this was 3 hours
acoustic bridge in The Greatest is my new roman empire, my stomach dropped
all the musicians are so in sync brooo
A voz de Billie é de arrepiar!
What microphone Billie and her brother are using to record their voice?
her voice is so expressive and gentle and sad and powerful and sarcastic all at the same time, such versatility 😩👏
her vocal agility is SOO GOOOOD 16:21
Finley,  a lot of happy teenagers
God billie is just so incredibly gorgeous 🤍
This was just enchanting and breathtaking. Thank you :')
she is so talent !
Meu sonho é limpar e organizar o tiny desk. Não aguento ver o artista cantando nessa BAGUNÇA
Who knew Charlie could sing so good with his white tee.
Their voices pair SO WELL it’s insane. Beautiful.
Where did the piano guy come from? The house of griffindor?
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥹🥹🥹🥹
❤
What a performance! It's incredible the hole vibe they created.  Billie, Finneas, amazing... other musicians... amazing.  I'm a musician studying the career and I can see the level of this production, it's simply amazing.  Congratulations. Btw, really good tinys this year, loved rita, paco and catriel and of course this one. Amazing 🔥
😍😍😍
GO LIONS
This is for me Billie´s best album. I´m so grateful for this tiny desk, thank you so muuuch!!
Muito bom!!!
This is art.
Que bonito canta está jeva
Can'y wait for Lola Young at Tiny Desk Concert.
This is my fiancée’s and my album of the year! Thank you Billie and Finneas, I hope I live to see 50 more years of magic from you both ❤
❤❤
her voice just gets more and more beautiful as time goes on
She sang "L' Amour De Ma Vie" totally in 50s Edith Piaf style.
this album changed my life this is everything
WOW
Tiny Desk is the new MTV Unplugged!
You can see the clearer part on her hair where the red used to be. She is so preetty!
Billie always makes me cry, she always fills us with pride 🥺💕
She’s got such a lovely jazzy/bluesy voice ♥️
It kind of upsets me that she has to introduce FINNEAS. Like, people should know who he is all on his own! Cmon people! He deserves to be just as famous as her. Love them both so much!!!!
Billie on acoustic is so sweet!!!
I really liked it better when tiny desk was a way to discover new artists.
amazing!
her harmoniesss ahhhhhhhh
Does she remember that she has done a tiny desk before?
Billie's such a beatiful human, thank you girl for being here and be who you are ❤
I LOVE YOU ON TINY DESK YOU ARE JOKINGGGGGGG
FINNEAS looks like the old oneeee
It amazes me how birds of a feather became so popular. From the very first time I listened to the album I skipped it, don’t like that song at all
Te amo billie, eu te amo tanto que só posso morrer depois de você.
Oh, so everyone gets to sit down but....... just kidding, great tiny desk, great band.
Getting hit Hard and Soft from this performance ❤‍🩹
I am so glad they performed I Love You and that Billie mentioned it is one of their favorites. I genuinely think that it is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. When I first heard it, I was so impressed with how someone so young could so perfectly capture exactly how beautifully terrifying it is to give your heart to someone. So well written and composed.
la mano arriba todo el mundo que llego paqui... ah no.
i've been looking forward to this since the release of HIT ME HARD AND SOFT!
Just amazing ❤
CRYING
El look que esta usando Billie en este tiny desk hace un contraste hermoso con la temática minimalista de sus melodías y el romanticismo de sus letras, i love it. Sometimes i get overwhelmed by seeing artists trying so hard to match the jewelry when it doesn't make sense sometimes. Se ven tan femenina y comoda.
🎧🛌🏾
🇦🇷 is waiting for you billie we love you❤
The way Finneas looks at Billie with such admiration. ❤
Her voice......ahhhh!
This is a masterpiece
15:54 im shedding tearsssss
i guess the backsound too loud 3:15
That was WAY too short! I need more!
brazil mentioned = my like given
Never clicked anything faster
Beautiful
back to back with doechii’s is wild the world is healing
amo af
Deja tu huella❤️‍🩹
La bandera de Colombia arriba 😭💗🇨🇴
love this !!
She looks so pretty 😍🥰
BIRDS OF A FEATHER 🪶❤
So are we running out of people to give NPR concerts to? 🤔
she and Finneas work so well together 🥹 I can confirm that there’s no one you can harmonize and make music with easier than your siblings
Finneas plays his guitar so effortlessly
ad reel in the middle of a song is crazy 💀
This guy can really sing
I love you
not the better help sponsorship 😭😭😭
i just fell in love for the first time ig
We need the weeknd next 😎
this is too good
Mi mujerrrrst 😍
Que genialidad la voz de esta mujer ❤ amoooo
I'm so tired of coming up with comments about how incredible and talented these two are. Can't they perform badly just one time to make it easier to write something fresh about them?
ahh so beautiful
She just keeps getting better and better... I took my daughter to see her right before the pandemic... It was one of the best concerts I've ever been to and I'm 66 years old!! Her voice is what heaven must be like and Finneas is a GENIUS!!
This makes me wonder why she does so much vocal comping? sounds so much better raw and authentic. Also love how much of a good role model she is, modest, humble, no auto tune, no fancy clothes, no makeup. pure beauty
BETTER THAN THE ORIGINALS AHHGHEHEL
BUM BUM BUMM!!!!!!
a legenda <3 saudade
Billie you’re absolutely the best !
I’m here for ocean eyes
My favourite corner of the Internet did it again! Thank you 🤗
Repeat mode all day long. 😉🫶
Malou
great great!! I love you Billie!!
She very vocie and so beutifullll🔥🔥💟💙❤❤❤💋💋👁👄
Here comes Finneas and Ferbie.
Today after hearing this I became a Billie Eilish fan ❤
Wasn't a fan before - but THIS iis DOPE - no computers - just 4 humans making joyful noise - BRILLIANT
Please find a better sponsor than Betterhelp.
😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 i lovy it
they way finneas looks at billie during i love you 🥹🥹 love them sm
Hold on the tears into the bus!
MI ESPOSAAATODA HERMOSAAAA💗💗😭🙏
Feels like I had a hug this morning. This was so needed. Thank you NPR ❤‍🩹
So Sublime❤
The pianist! :OOOOO
Does anyone know what guitar is Finneas playing? He usually uses Taylor but that looks kinda like a Gibson, I'm confused...i need a guitar nerd 😭
They are the greatest!
Miua miua miua miuaaaau
Magnificent performance!
Adverts in these songs really ruin the mood. Otherwise, simply beautiful, delicate and perfect…
this was unbelievably beautiful and pure, feels past due but like perfect timing at the same time. I love this thank you to everyone 💞
are these on spotify cus I love these live versions🥹🥹🥹
Love how she can be silly and then so emotional
Faltó wildflower 😢
This video made youtube premium worth it.
I live for Billie's eyebrows and her facial  expressions.
Was really hoping we were gonna get a cool acoustic version of the ending of L'amour de ma vie
FINALLY
What’s the first song called ?
the way she ATE THAT UPPPPPPPPP
SHE CHANGED THE LYRICS TO LAMOUR
😊❤😅😢😮😊 Alles dabei, leichter Depri - Hang - Vorsicht... Aber trotzdem Überragende Künstlerische Leistung von allen - Einige "WoW" & "Woo - Ha" Effekte mit allen Drum und dran, wie Gänsehaut. So hast du sie noch nicht gehört! ❤❤❤😊😊😊 Danke!
That last song sounds like a rip of bleeding love by Leona lewis.
This version of I love you is killing me 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺  I love it so so so so so much
Better help ignored my application
she really can sing, great rhythym feeling
00:55 already got me emotional, shes not from this planet
Omg, I'm so happy she's back
LAAA AMOO, BYEE 😭😭💗
Does anyone know what the vocal mics are? Looks like they might be a Sennheiser, just based on how long the unreadable name appears to be :)
primeira de um bilhao de vezes que vou ver isso.
she looks like she has a beautiful soul
please please press this on vinyl, like the Mac one. This is beautiful.
Singing I Love You has healed me 🥺 I listened to that song in my lowest❤
I don’t like how she sings through her nose. She’s talented but it’s a matter of taste. Not knocking the skill just the style.
im so geis
What a snooze fest.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Yes! Thanks @NPRMusic @TinyDesk ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Son el dio dinamico 👏👏👏 parece que estan cantando en un chino 😊
LAUFEY feels
We should be able to sue for mid-song ads
I haven't heard 'I love you' in so long (it used to be my favorite song) and she sings it so extremely gently here i died
Love love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ in Brasil 👂👂👂👂👂❤❤❤❤❤
next will be Ariana Grande
You couldn't find a better singer?
i love you so much
Perfeição ❤
Her band as a whole is serving Princess Diaries vibes and I’m here for it. 👏🏻
Billie hermosa❤❤❤... que hermoso Tiny Dask... La producción se lució.... Y como siempre Billie y Phineas mostrando su talento ❤
Não é à toa que é minha artista número 1❤
She’s beauty and she’s grace
te amo mujer
pppfff qué bestia suena en acústico cheee
This was too short 😭
They are so incredibly talented
she got the confidence back whn finenas staterd to snig
Great little set.   I'm impressed that she and Finneas can sing that way with no in-ear monitors and that the band can play *down* to her level of quiet.    The bass provides such a beautiful foundation.
doechii then billie eilish??? am in heaven?
goosebumps
a la pura llore y llore, i love you es mi cancion favorita, salio como mi top 1 en spotify
F'n AMAZING! Go Billie!!!🔥💪🏼
Tiny Desk >>>> Anything else.
Oh wow! The way the word "Saudade" is perfect for describing these songs!!!  Love it so much, Billie and Finneas are amazing as always.
We need a Billie acoustic album!!
eyelash and finnyus is so good wow luv them x
Billie and Finneas’ chemistry is everything
Com vocês o melhor NPR QUE EXISTIU 🗣🗣🥰😍❤️🥹💙💚💛🧡❤️💜🖤🤍🤎💞💘❣️❤️‍🩹💖💝💗💓
She's a complete music genius, I'm so glad to be alive at the time Billie Eilish is. Love her music, her voice is pure gold!
Nice!
How is it possible to sound even better live! So talented ❤
I think she’s an angel
Thank you, Billie, you are great !!!
Amazing 😍
Did she forget she was on here before? 6:25
Her vocals are like work or art
What is with the ad placements?? 💀💀
This is too sacred to have ads pop up in every song 😭
Wow! I just watched something very Special!
Por qué este Tiny Desk no está disponible en Venezuela? Fue imposible encontrarlo desde el buscador sin usar un VPN
I was just watching their At Home Concert and I was hoping they’d come back for an In Person!!! My heart is full! 😊
Te extraño tanto :(
así me reciben en el paraíso
Congratulations Billie & Finneas this is so beautiful!
no son Ca7riel y paco amoroso pero estuvo bueno
I haven’t heard one of these with the audience clapping after each song. The artist usually just sings straight through. I wish they would have taken that out.
oasis is objectively better
I’m listening to this version of “I love you” while rain is pouring outside. What a great moment to be alive 😮‍💨
Yiiiiiiiih Billiiie
te amo phineas !
te amo billieee
slay porran
I love them❤
Ahhhh I could listen to Billie's voice 4eva ❤🖤💚
Gawd…. I can’t possibly love her more than I already do & Finneas to boot❤️🫶🌻🤓you two beautiful souls make my heart so happy❤❤❤
wow ....
0:21 - THE GREATEST 6:43 - L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:52 - i love you 18:26 - BIRDS OF A FEATHER
Simplemente fantástica ! ❤
Seen her at Glastonbury a few years ago ❤.    Roll on London July 2025!!   Merry Christmas Billie
listening to this at 12.35am midnight is a totally different vibe
Where are the chapters?
This broadcast was brought to you by Vitamin D! Get More!!
MIAU MIAU MIAU MIAU MIAU MIAU MIAUMIAU
Mejor me voy al Tiny de paquito y catriel... zzz...
What mic is on voices?
zzzzzzzz
Liked the video before she started singing
Superb
We need Mustafa the poet next!!!!
For god's sake, when will you put this on Spotify? Put all the tiny desk concerts, jesus mary magdalene.
Billie Greatish
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
My fav idol for Ever🥹💕✨
9 mins in and wondering why and who and how and thank you
There’s not a single acoustic performance of Billie and Finneas where I haven’t cried in front of my phone, they sound so angelic ffr
I LOVE YOU NOTE CHANGE!!!!
So boring, tedious
It’s nice to see she isn’t dressed like 03 Eminem
billie is so angelic
What’s crazy to me is she still has so much potential, and every album has given her grammys
Girl can flat out sing!
Listening to This is what heaven feels like I imagine
Oh no, not you guys falling in the Better Help trap, too.
✴🤍🖤.   Melodic
Flawless. Her voice is from another world
Miss Bad Guy… 🥲 Nevertheless, I’m a Fan ! 👍👏😘
TE AMOOOOO
Is Finneas playing the beginning of Liar by Serj Tankian on guitar at 11:53 ?
Can we do a better job timing the ads…very frustrating
❤
What a voice! amazing how can she can control her breathing, her instrument is air! amazing Billie! ❤great band too ❤
💙
*omg! i can't believe she's a grown woman now. i remmember listening to her song ocean eyes and belly ache before; young, unstable and broke and still am now that im a man nothing has change for the past years. i've been listening to billie for 8 years, i've watched all her interviews in variety, etc. she really made an impact in my life, she's one of the reason why i'm still alive today. i'd be a forever fan of her. i'm bawling my eyes out when she sang “i love u” that's my favorite song of her, i hope she sing wildflower also. aahhh, i yapped too much. anyway, i love u sm billie. you are my life, really. i really hope i can make it til 2025.*
no big deal just crying. you pull every single one of my heart strings billie. i LOVE YOU we love you.
How a superstar must do a NPR Tiny desk as showed by Billie 👌 So stripdown and raw. ( Still wanting to see her perform with MARO)
tiny desk with aurora... please. xd
i love it so much more than any studio version!
This is the concert experience I wish I could have... the purity of her voice is so tranquil and entrancing. Having people sing over her is a total different experience. Thank you for doing this!
I wish this was 3 hours long ❤
Big venue...
Te ammmmmmmmooooo❤❤❤❤
💓🌸💓PERFECTLY DONE...ALL💓🌸💓
gata dms
Billie😮😮😮
Josh Newell. Audio techncial engineer. Great work!
I don't normally listen to Billie, but that third song had me crying. She's got an amazing voice that expresses a ton of emotion as she's singing
Wow.
Боже! Это прекрасно! 🤍
Wow! The support between Billie and Finneas is truly amazing!
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
tiny desks up now
Boycot Better help. It sells customer data and had "therapists" working there without any degrees
amazing. besos.
Never really listened to Billie (and Finneas) Eilish before. May have to change my ways now. The songs. The musicianship.
The greatest is so sad to me
Love their music! They’re amazing
18:30 love the fact that she stole beats from one and only Oliver Dragojević.
so overdue
<3
💩 💩!!!!!! Not this trash can 🗑️ NPR do better !
15:21 the way they both telepathically locked in for this moment is everything
Perfect artist with a perfect voice. Could listen to her for years.
Perfect 🤩
SABRINA CARPENTER WHEN????????
you are so freaking talented billie 🥰
wow ♥ i couldn't find the "fire" emoji, so this will have to do. bravo!
This is beautiful
I love her so much
Every day you check Tiny Desk ..... Waiting for a day..... A day like today ..... Then one day today is now, this is that time. ❤️
I was not ready for i love you. It hit me like a train.
Man...🥲
Beautiful.
Never clicked so fast... Tiny Desk is bringing in legends
Starts with 20 seconds of someone talking. Great idea. Very replayable
Canetou.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
imagine Billy singing Bossa Nova!.....
Virginie Buckley here :) I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BILLIE & MARO ON TINY DESK SINGING TOGETHER  ! LETS MAKE THIS HAPPEN Guys! ❤
a great way to exemplify the word "Saudade" <3
nice to take a nap
Gotta watch Billie on YouTube because her tickets are 500+ for nosebleeds .. I will not support corrupt greed.
Incredible voice
Wow! Love this so so much!! 🥹
I have no one to talk about 21:18 😭😭😭
❤❤❤
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Te amo demasiado
Thank you I cried !
You explained this so well, thank you!
love melody of 'birds of feather'.. feeling weird (good way)
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Unpopular opinion:  Every song sounds the same.  Not sure why all the hype about her ASMR-style whisper singing.
End? Why would you do that?
the second she said "i love you" i started crying
eu amo como ela só abre a boca e balança a cabeça e sai o melhor som que eu ja ouvi em todo  a minha vida
2.3 mil in 22 hrs. That is wild!
EU TE AMO VEY
Wonderful
such a chill presentation , love it
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Made me cry, the whole thing. Wasn’t expecting that.
I started my day with a good cup of coffee and this beautiful performance ❤
you can see the emotion in her face for every song. its like each song takes her back to that time and the emotions she had when they wrote them. I like when that happens, instead of the artist just reciting the song. it's a whole experience.
It's amazingggg.. please come again.. 🥺💗
Uma obra de arte, Billie Eilish. Eu espero por esse dia desde 2021, e finalmente ele chegou. O Set perfeito pra você brilhar e mostrar a perfeição que são os seus vocais, suas letras, e sua interpretação. Que orgulho ser uma das suas maiores fãs, aos meus 39 anos.
Get some sun ocean eyes 🙂
Get some sunshine sunshine smile girl 😊
Bird of a feather reminds me a lot of one of paramore newer songs
She sounds South African when she speaks 🇿🇦 and I ❤ it😊
There was something on vh1 or mtv years ago called Unplugged this feels like that
Close enough. Welcome back, The Civil Wars!
Never really listened to her music before but I’m really blown away
Is her pianist the one that made Willows songs?? big feelings and  symptom of life?
Billie eillish on tiny desk before gta 6
❤❤❤❤🥰❤❤❤❤🥰
My GIRL…. She is amazing! ❤❤❤
Zzz see it in x2
🔥
DOES THIS SOUND LIKE WHISPERING TO YOU HELLO?? HATERS???YEAH I THOUGHT SO! 8:37
Esto por qué no existia
❤❤❤❤
excellent
I love them so much and how Finneas pays attention to Billie during I love you is precious 🥹
new Lana Del Rey, even sader
<3
Billie is that girl.
Bravo!👏
Never been the biggest Billie Eilish fan but every time I see these concerts they always change my mind
Love them 💛💛
hat-trick para a mocinha!
Such an amazing voice and the lyrics and melody to every song! ❤👌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

Só eu acho que o irmão dela quer aparecer demais ?
AMAZING!
Magníficos, geniales, toda mi admiración
Wow, chills ♥️
te amo billie!!
8:28 🔥🔥😍
shes so taletend!
the vocals on this album are insane. I feel like she's taking singing lessons and it really shows omg. She used to struggle hitting some of these live notes live, and now she's killing it !!
La belleza de lo simple y honesto . Abrazo grande
She is save me.... I only want to say tysm Billie😌💋
I love u billie ❤
🤩
Omg!!! Billie!!❤️
BILLIE YOUR VOICE IS INCREDIBLY WONDERFULL❤❤
That opening, "I'm trying me best . . ." broke down 😍
best singer in history period
I love her with my whole heart there is no way to explain how much i love this woman!
Me realizing the applauses upset my stomach because IIIIII want to be there so bad😩😍😍 I'm so happy for the people who got the opportunity!! She's the greatest!
Woow🥰🥰 foreve Billie Eilish
Loveee
The World`s Greatest & Sweetest Artist -----Big Greetz From Germany----Germany Loves You Billie, You Know That...!!!
❤❤❤
She is a goddess 🫶🏻
Omg i clicked SO fast  edit: ugh i love her shes seriously the most charming person ever. i love how shes always real and was vulnerable about being nervous and just beat from tour <3 she killed this and i would love to see her do another tiny desk concert!
My god l'amour de ma vie is really one of the best songs ever written
sobbing the whole time
🥲 it's all so beautiful
Para, para, para... Tatuaje en cuello? 😅
Amazing all
You were the love of my life
Love her fresh new look !!
Que mina maravillosa
Yes yes yes ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yall tried it. I almost paid for ad free. Love Billie!
Ok but this was IN-SANE. This songs are definitely not easy to perform and they absolutely killed it with the right instrumentation and vocalization. Also her face expressions... nah this is ridiculous. So freaking good.
NPR Music doing it again!
je l'attendais avec impatience❤
okay hear me out - a billie + phineas jazzy christmas album would be out of this world 😍😍🎄🎄
if you mute, billie looks like she's trying to push out the hardest dookie
Por dios te amooo
💙
This is my Tiny Desk fav. Incredibly good on every aspect.
I’m sobbing
nothing could’ve made me happier than seeing this was just uploaded
Anyone else hit the thumbs up before the concert even start? I knew this was going to be amazing, and I was not wrong.
She is so beautiful ❤❤❤❤
Love You Billie ❤🇦🇷
this will always be my safe place 🤍
how come she didn't dress like Chingy for this
Wow
where’s her fitted cap, timbs and grill at?
🥱
I dunno why watching this made me so emotional but I love me some Billie
Cryinggggg ☹️☹️
More ads please :/
NPR is absolutely KILLING IT RN
She sounds so good and she looks so pretty. I wish her nothing but success over the years.
I love u billie
Not her shading Tiny Desk for waking up early 😂 😭
She is an angel
hermosa te amo casate conmigo
A Joy ❤❤❤
BETTERHELP IS A SCAM THAT HURT MANY PEOPLE
SO GOOD
EXCELLENT 💯 💯 💯 THANKS ❤️
You have this old time voice like you are from a time so before your time ! ! ! I Love Love 💜 Your heartfelt voice and your personality is just beautiful!
Bam bam bam!
Guys her outfit looks like in the animation from a song called dirty-ksi
Man their family must be so proud. Not just because of their talent and success but also how close they have always been and stayed together
Sounds like hayley williams 😅
"Go as a girl today" Well thats what you are.
THE WAY YOU CAN SEE THE RED ROOTS
The annunciation of words is key. Need more of that... Beautiful.
Acoustic album please!!
Get lana del rey
She is just amazing!! Billie the artist that you are!!
she played i love you 😭😭
Buscai ao Senhor enquanto se pode achar invocai-o enquanto está perto 🍂 Isaías 55.6🍂
SOOO GOOD
Nothing like an ad right in the middle of a song.
The voices, the sound, the feeling… music is everything 💜
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First song. The Greatest. Doing a softer version for this acoustic set. I cannot express how much I love Billie and Finneas.
te amo reina🥺💗
Como esta de Hermosa Billie.
Te amo Billie el mejor regalo de cumpleaños 12/12 ❤
I love you is such a great song but that chorus always reminded me of hallelujah, it bothers me a bit ngl, I wish they played wildflower instead. Btw, this is definitely one of my favorite tiny desks ever, Billie is the best pop artist out there, no doubt 👏👏👏
Pq é tão curto?? 😢 Preciso de pelo menos 1h disso... ❤
Why'd she say that she was dreaming to be on tiny desk all her life if she was there already 4 years ago? :O
Literally crying 🥹👌 so beautiful
Listening on repeat
It's beautiful music. Thanks Billie 😊
I need Finneas tiny desk.
Just beautiful.  They are both before their time. Amazing! ❤❤❤
Billie looks amazing! 🎄
Ooooh what a great time to be alive 🙌🏼💕✨ Thank god for the Tiny Desks
I literally did a double take when I saw this pop up in my feed!
We need Sabrina carpenter!!!
La mejor voz del planeta tierra
Acoustic Billie Eilish better than Acoustic iShowspeed🎉
THE BESTTTT *.*
良い❗️
Divinity. The perfect distance from perfect, so human and so beautiful
Why is Billie dressed like a substitute teacher😂😂♥
i love you being on the set list 😭😭
Que nítido!! Tiny desk es la mejor prueba para saber quién es un buen cantante y quién no. Esos micrófonos!!! Diooomio!!
te amo 💙
She looks more and more like Claudia
Me when they started singing I love you: 🥲🥲🥲🥲😭😭😭😭😭
beautiful voice
She sounds infinitely better live like this, she has SO much in her voice that's lost the album recordings. With her kind of music, its the emotion and vulnerability in her voice that takes it to another level.
This was magic omg
surreal
idk why fineas starring at billie like that but to me it looks like admiration to me, i love the way he watches her
Id rather be blind than deaf b/c i wouldnt want to miss an angel singing
i can never listen to I love you without crying
Igor te amo
La voz de Billie Eilish es simplemente hermosa y sanadora 🤎
She played i love you 🥲
She is amazing her voice is sooooo 😍
I could listen to this forever
there is so much love in her brother's eyes
How is it 22 mins already
Mediocre at best. She's all studio production. This exposes that.
Not so tiny lip-filler. Creepy.
She is the most beautiful person I have ever seen in my life 🥹👑🇧🇷
Everytime she hypnotize me
Cringe
Ganz großes Kompliment, NPR🎉..thanks😊
I absolutely love Billie!!! She has one of the best voices everrr ❤❤❤
very pretty but her singing aint all that
Es una LOCURA su voz dios
Thank you so much, Billie and Finneas!!! I love hearing you sing live - you are so flawless! Love the outfit, too❤
Wow Billie has got a great voice. I knew she was that singer and this confirms her greatness for me.
Wauw.
OMG THE HARMONIES... PERFECTION
I love it when the intro starts, and the song kicks in.
I LOVE YOU😢
This is toooooo great! Billie, her voice, this album... Perfection. ❤
best 22 minutes of my life
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Finally thank you Tiny Desk..... You made my day😊🥰
OMG crying at the first chord of I Love You 😭💞😻
Uff this is Butter for my soul ❤
Love you Billie
jazzy❤
❤❤ I am YouTuber❤❤ ❤❤ Ma YouTuber ho❤❤ ❤👉 Mero Tech channel xa🎉 ❤ Mero channel Bata hajur haru help hunxa🎉  🎉❤NICE VIDEO❤❤🎉
Pianist feelin them vibes 🥰🥰 Soo soo beautiful. As always.
Try Brian Mendoza , his cover’s are insane, he’s on YouTube, his Spotify only has original’s, his Billie is out of this world ❤❤❤❤
味わうように歌うって、素敵😮 ポンポンポーン、大好き❤
SHE IS FEEDING USSSS THIS MONTHHH
Quien lo iba a pensar que Billie elish tiene influencias de Carla Morrison
I love Billie, thank you for healing my heart with those melodies of your song 🤩
So... if Solo is on the bass... when Solo makes a solo is the Solo's bass solo?
This is literally a brain massage
They should bring John Mayer in. He would probably do great in this format.
Wdym that there’s a glovo add in the middle of the greatest?
Loveee when Billie and Fineas harmonise together! Such a beautiful video all together
Billie is so beautiful ❤ her voice is stunning. I love Finneas, too!! Please always be together! Like Karen carpenter ❤❤❤❤
Great performance!!!
es un angel
Both so talented it's a pleasure to listen to Billie and Finneas
My mother gave me life but Billie's songs give me the desire to live it. ❤❣😻😻
It's unfair to compare, but it feels like she's this generation's KD Lang
Billie is the best, I love her from day 1.
This concerts should've last one hour MINIMUM
Hermoso herrrrrrrrmoso ❤
bro that version of BOAF legit makes me want billie to release a finneas version of the song with his adlibs and bg vocals
Birds of a feather is giving Maggie Rogers!!!!
La voz mas tranquilizante, por alguna razon me produce melancolia.
Loving this tiny desk ❤
My babyyyyyyy billieeee❤
Her voice is so special
lol Abe looks like Nick O'Malley i cant
Nice setlist 🥺
Odio que YOUTUBE TENGA TANTA PUBLICIDAD.... NO PUEDE SER QUE UNA PLAYAFORMA DE MUSIXA TE CORTE UN CONCIERTO POR PUBLICIDAD 🤨🤨🤨
Literally brought to tears again. Thank you Tiny Desk and Billie for sharing your most vulnerable with us all. I feel like I’m in the studio with you and Finneas just experiencing your sheer raw talent. It’s such a privilege that we don’t deserve ❤
Finneas tiny desk next!
My 2,5yr old asks all the time with her tiny dutch voice if we can listen to Billie Eilish. With the little to none screen time she get's, we have showed her a few tiny desk concerts to realise music is something people make in stead of only knowing the spotify icon on our phones.  So thank you all, i will definitly show this to her and i think she will be in awe.
LOVE IT! But video and sound is not in sync, right?
Wow she's reduced weight 😮
Quem sabe faz ao vivoooo!  Musa💙
Excellent 👌 ❤
ame!!!
The way he looks at her with utter pride 😭❤️
These versions of her songs are toned down compared to the originals, but boy do I still get chills
You always shine girl I love you till the day that I die❤❤❤
Omgggggggg
the versatility of the "new" generations of musicians is superb, from rappers that do amazing soul and r'n'b shows, to the out of this world billies it's just amazing... tiny concerts only in length cause they are MIGHTY!!! to those that say music is dead... open our ears ;-)
Watching this in 20 hours ago after uploaded is crazyy
One of the most humble and pure Tiny Desk's ever!
💗💗💗
This is amazingggg
where is meow meow ?
W O W
Enamorado de ella al 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000%
Te amo, de verdad que si :)
Billie is a Beast!!!
Absurdaaaaaaaa
this is so emotional, thank you🙏
QUE MULHER INCRÍVEL, EU A AMO TANTO 💙
😍
omgggg billieeeeee 💗💗💗
loml
Unreal
Been waiting for her to come on here 😍
Are you aware of the Iranian woman singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , who held a 'virtual' live concert on YouTube without an audience, and her band was arrested the next day? Please watch her video and support her.let's amplify courage
Min  12 mi parte favorita
Probably the best tiny desk yet ❤
조아아악!!❤
Her becoming more and more mature in her voice and artistry is the development I love. Here for it.
Her perfume is at Burlington and Macy's.
next lana del ray
Io la amo
<3
Gak heran mbak Billie kocak, dari kecil suka nonton ludruk 😂
Gak heran mbak Billie kocak, dari kecil suka nonton ludruk 😂
I love this
Billie Eilish and FINNEAS : Tiny Desk Concert
I love how they have mac's hat in the background 💜
OBRIGADOOOOO
Cna we start a petition for these concerts to be put up on streaming services, I want these versions on my Spotify playlists so bad 😭
💛💛💛
If you are into young girl love songs, they're the best. Luckily almost everybody grews up. Funny how she introduce herself and her brother as if she wasn't aware of their super mega fame.
Bass player is cool
Como no va a cantar wildflower??????😭😭😭😭😭
I love you
her live vocals never fail to impress!! literally an angels voice
This isn’t long enough
Te amo demasiado Billie
I didn't know how much I needed this version ❤️‍🩹
I love you so much Billie ❤
She’s so pretty
I accidentally listened to the first song on 1.25x speed, and it's just as good (or even better) - That's what I call talent.
I swear Tiny Desk be bringing us modern day MTV Unplugged
Love the unique acoustic experience that tiny desks bring along❤
Billie♥
Wildflower not being in the set list is  A CRIME!!!!!!!!
Doechii last week and now Billie… We eating good
so pretty
God. The talent emanating from these people. Glad she’s a superstar but there are too many talentless modern artists who get more props. Seems unfair.
She sang i love you my favorite song😭❤
Billie on Tiny Desk finallyyyyy!!!
вау просто!
Whoever’s idea it was to create NPR Tiny Desk deserves a raise
"I'm also dressed like a girl, it's so weird "😂😂
The sexiest most emotive, modern vocalist is Billie Eilish
18:27
Los amo 🫶🏼
Ayyyyy ❤ justo llendo a mi universidad escuchado esta melodía 😢
Those harmonies on THE GREATEST immediately made me think of The Civil Wars. Killer!
i could listen to this all day
I need the greatest piano sheets NEOWWW
FONALLYYYYYY UGHHHHHHTBTBTB
Billie being my number one artist on Spotify and Finneas being my number 8 is my roman empire ❤
Just put your headphone on close your eyes and then heaven appears.
Hola, aquí los fans latinos❤ estábamos esperando este tiny desk...🎉
Can you guys please bring Kwesi Arthur,  he's popular and he has the numbers too, please 🙏

Thank god for this
It’s better live than ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The worst parts of this video were the parts she took those short breaks😭...like girl don't stopppp😭❤❤
Still not a fan
I love you…. That song..
This altered my brain chemistry
She’s unbelievable
She and her brother are really artists, the whole word and meaning.
foi saudade mesmo
The greatest sounded so perfect
The way her brother looks at her …. Is absolute REASSURANCE and LOVE …. May we all find someone that looks at us how finneas looks at Billie <3
igualito a paco amoroso
Billie is my new Regina Spektor, sorry Regi ❤
we need a whole acoustic album NOW!
Her vocals sounds so refreshing 😫😭❤❤
What happened to her fake latina accent? 😢
The worst tiny desk ever… come on!
Amazing beille, tiny desk We need Joe Thomas, CB sessions too

Bro on guitar!
It’s taking me 20 mins to get past the first song, can’t stop rewinding.
6:53 ❤
She is just such an amazing person❤
Those 22:35 minutes flew by like a mintue and a half. I'm in awe
Esta mujer en acústico suena espectacular!
This is the best tiny desk episode ever done
Im sobbing
THE BESTT TINY DESKKK ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Definitely won't be listening to this a second time
TOP.
very great way to finish the year
Imagine watching this and knowing these two are your kids. WHAT!!?   when they harmonised I literally got goosebumps at all times. Can they have a duo album PLEASE
She's so 🔥
Mahnnn. BILLIE EILISH can sing💫
Love you Billie🤍
I love this reinterpretation specifically for tiny desk! Finneas on harmonies & school-uniform adjacent suits.
I’m soo glad finneas was there ….. made it the greatest ! All pun intended
Amazing! ❤❤❤❤
Heavenly 🥹
We love you Billie 🥹💓
My goodness
❤beautiful voice
🫠💕💕💕
As an older guy (and musician myself) who doesn't know much about this singer, I'd like to say... she is very good. Reminds me of Mazzy Star. The performance really expressed emotion, and the singer was technically on point with no use of pitch correction. Band was good too! Great stuff!
Someone get Bruno mars on this
I love her with all my heart - her way of expressing and connecting with music!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAAAAN
Wow.
❤❤❤
uff!!! cuanto talento y belleza, desbordan ambas cualidades en este angel!
The audio engineering always blows my mind!
🤮complete cringe
I love you mi ha distrutto.
The way finneas looks at her
Te amooo billiee
This is public broadcasting :)
🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪🇻🇪❤️❤️❤️❤️
💙

Finneas harmony 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was beautiful. So well done.
❤❤❤❤
Por qué no hizo la nota alta en birds of a feather 😢😢
ai can't recreate this   absolutely beautiful
Should’ve sung Wildflower 😭
❤
18:21 that's what you are looking for😅
She's actually a great singer 😮 unlike Taylor who gave a strikingly plain performance on TDC 😈
Is having great hair mandatory to play with Billie or a consequence of it? I loved the concert!!
Billie and Finneas are so gifted. I enjoy the energy between them. They are so grounded. And Billie has a natural beauty.❤ thank you tiny desk!
this is the most beautiful thing i’ve ever listened to
la buena música es atemporal, este tiny le gusta a mi hija de 14 años y a mi de 47. maravillosa voz.
She needs to collab with Maro asap
Hands down, the best Tiny Desk concert ever recorded. Billie and Finneas are a true force of nature!
I WAS NOT READY FOR I LOVE YOU I WAS NOT READY OH MY GOD I WAS NOT READY OH MY GOD
sera se ela tava passadno mal ?
Cuando a Billie se le olvida que es humana!!!❤❤❤❤ Es queee la amoooo!!!!
There is no doubt she is the one of best singers
Show
I died when she said she's gonna sing i love you omgggggg im sobbing
this beats studio versions of these songs by a mile
Billie is the greatest.
Vocals, and the musicians, did not come to play - perfection ❤
She's so fkn cool
she’s so darling
The song i love you is so Destiel coded omg!
please youtube, stop spoiling beautifull moment like those putting pub at the middle of every songs😢
the only bad thing about tiny desks is that they're like only 4 songs. please give me 35 more.
the little noises in the background of i love you make it sound exactly like the real recording in the song 🥹
What a beautiful and lovely set.  Extremely talented brother and sister!
birds of a feather after i love you is CRIMINAL
I just love, love, LOVE how he keeps looking at her with such calmness and love in his eyes towards her its just beautiful im crying my freaking eyes out😂❤❤
Obrigado por escolher a palavra "SAUDADE", ela define bem o que estávamos sentindo. 🥰
💕💕🔥
Out of tune cat
this is so beautiful!
So awesome Tiny Desk give artists like Billie a chance to reach a bigger audience
❤❤❤
미쳤다 너무좋다❤
Ao vivo fica ainda melhor 😮👏
Not a good group of musicians.
I’m not only gonna mention how I started crying halfway through ”I love you” but I also adore that the note change in it has become a regular thing❤
worldwide areana tours but they can’t afford a chair for that bassist?
💯
Brother looks creepy
Thanks tiny desk
That was so cool so pure! Good job❤❤❤
Out kast quando ?
SO CLASSY SO NICE SO FUN
Her voice when sing live very bad,  just like regular people
Fujii Kaze for tiny desk Japan, now Billie Eilish, this is definitely my best gifts of this year
Qué puta mierda las propagandas a la mitad de la música . Respeten al menos un tole las experiencias y el arte.
nobody tell about how finneas is a good singer
Se parece un montón a una achica que conozco   😮
Senti falta das melhores músicas 🥲
Love your Songs ❤❤
meu deus finalmente no tiny desk de verdade aaaaaaaaaaa
The last good thing NPR will ever do -
Hype
People: how many times have you seen this? Me: yes
kommie kunt
Please watch/listen to this with headphones.  You’re welcome.
estou arrepiada
I've never hated youtube adds more
Christ this girl is dull
Loved it.
Sooooo good!! ❤❤❤
11:59 yay the Zelda song!
Only Amazing !
god is a woman
LOVING her voice and the groove of her band
😍
I didn't even realize how much I needed this..pure therapeutic music..Billie we love you so much <3, thank you for being THE GREATEST.
So boring..
Thank you for this 🥹🤍
Diosssss the best ❤
W❤W
That last song is maybe as old as Billie Eilish and it is from Croatian composer. How on earth did it end up here?
5:45 oh man, that made me cry
Tao linda e perfeita
they just gave vocal coaches new stuff to react to
FINALLY! Couldn't have picked a better Billie & Finneas era for this, though.
0:44 THE GREATEST 6:44  L’AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 I LOVE YOU 18:20 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
I hope they bring ariana grande next
This is heaven❤❤❤
mi abuelo siempre decía, tiny desk de la billie 18:24
This is beautiful
iam already with saudade of this tiny desk. </3
finneas is an artist, billie is just a singer
I wait Lana to be here!
LOVED this❣️ I was a teen in the eighties... I thought 80’s music was the best until I heard artists like Billie and Finneas.  This last album was truly a masterpiece! Thank you NPR.
very beautiful, thank you...
Wpw
La humanidad necesitaba esto 🛐🛐
her fit is sooo cuteeeeeses
Ed maverick pls
one of my favorite performance
Stumbling upon this randomly was SOO unexpected yet amazing😫
Please invite Twenty one pilots here
Why does she have so many bruises?
está impecável 🥹
She sounds so good live.
im not crying you’re crying
Her voice is like silk.
Incredible
If they don't run commercials in between the performance then how will they pay up your next super star to perform😏
🤍🤍🤍🤍
Simplemente hermoso! ❤
👇🏻Under a day gang
빌리야 개쩐다🥹🥹🥹
Tengo una hermana melliza... Para cuando un Tiny con los dos hermanos, guitarra y voz...... Personalmente creo que no hacía falta nada más.
I love YOU BILLIE
One song in… welcome back The Civil Wars.
holy sht she can sing i thought she was just another pop singer, NPR should put this on spotify
chills!! this is so good
inspirational
Beautiful, Music in its Natraul Beauty 💙
I love you change of note came to stay❤
Chato demais, meu Deus, que depre
ILY BILLIE✨🦋
❤ Billie 😢
"Sponsored by Better Health" and then just putting mid role ads in the MIDDLE of songs is just dumb.... maybe no one checked where the adds were but thats definitly a mess up
❤ incredible ❤
Birds of a feather was so fcking good
Finneas is so sweet to her! She did amazing.
This is my Roman empire❤
I demand all tiny desks be put on Spotify immediately
Dear Santa, James Blake? Please...☺
Simplemente hermosa ❤
Feel sorry for the Korok being shook by the percussion guy
fraco demais
Tiene muy mal sonido
Marilia adamaki took legal action,stop on purpose 12 dec cause her album this day,u stole all hers every word hers for every word,sentence,she action legal,law stops u
next time zayn❤❤❤
The Tiny desk Concert were MADE just for Billie. How lovely is to hear her "unplugged". So nice to hear, I could hear her unpluggeds over and over again, her voice is just right for this.
Law force u to stop stealing marilia adamaki,12 dec her album u on purpose,greatest,lifes a thriller lamour l vie life,all copyrighted her titles and all hers,u stole all hers for all releases for both finneas stole for every sentence,for every word he stole blended all marilia songs,albums
had me at saudade
NPR i beg you turn off the ADs, there's nothing worse than listening to a beautiful song and getting touched and all of a sudden there's a brainrot ad popping up for 30 seconds absolutely ruining it all. You're already making money off other stuff, please do us a favour.
Bassist in the back like looks like he just escaped high school
I opened yt to watch inguinal canal anatomy then saw this. Screamed a little while pressing watch……totally forgot that i need to study
THE GREATEST!!!!! 🥰
❤
I feel like i just went to heaven. I feel like i want to cry and happy at the same time. Thank you❤
No way. Been waiting for this since before Billie was known. Saudade conveyed.
I need this on spotify.
Impecáveis!! ❤
straight into my heart 💘❤️❤️❤️
Muak
🫀🫀🫀
So effortless. Amazing.
Really? Betterhelp???
finneas did not need to jump in on the vocals someone edit him out
It’s always an instant click for the tiny desk. Thanks for the videos!
Saudade define. 🥲
Wait NPR is taking sponsorships from betterhelp now..? YIKES.
❤
❤❤❤
the way that Finneas watches her during the last part of 'I love you' makes me cry, reminds me of when she cried during that one concert.
No way y'all got the Canadian Canary on Tiny Desk ! I Was looking forward to Chihiro FONK remix but the songs she chose were good too.
Billie the woman you are
❤️🅱️💙🎖️👑🎖️💙🅱️❤️
15:44 thought she was going to sing HALLELUJAH in the middle of the song
SAUDADE❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹🥲
Beautiful voice🥹🥹❤ I love you
she could sing the alphabet and i’d be on my knees, begging for more. this wasn’t a concert; it was a life-altering event. i would literally sell my soul to her
We love you B
Around of applause for Anamaria Sayre, beautiful introduction, love from Taiwan.
Tiny desk is such a good place to actually listen to singers. I love these versions, and Billie in this format shines. Love everything about this. Major props to the team and especially the audio engineer.
Makes me cry just how much this hits. Thousands of years of humanity and I’m alive to watch billie and fin.
E extremamente masculina
where is the DR flag? :(
❤ my life😢😂❤
Her voice is really really good, glad to hear it ❤️❤️
Her diction while singing is excellent. Such clarity and detail in both aspects of the sound. In an era of talk-whisper singing etc mumbling this is very refreshing.
Boring
OH I LOVE HER
Finneas just seems like the perfect older brother. He shows his flaws in this performance, but it doesn't matter since it's clear all he cares about is his little sister. What an absolutely beautiful soul.
tiny desk, HUGE audience 👏🏾
Tiny desk is simple the best
Shes amazing.....they are no words...except maybe round three anyone????
YES YES YES !
0:33 - the greatest 6:45 - la'mour de ma vie 11:53 - i love you 18:28 - birds of a feather
She has a beautiful smile and voice
Birds of a feather was weird she sounded like she couldn’t keep up
ビリーアイリッシュ最高‼︎今日は、風邪で寝込んでいたので癒されてました♡大好き♡
'I love you' is also my favorite, thank you for this live performance 💜
The ads are so annoying
Acoustic birds of a feather sounds rlly nice 🙏🙏
muhteşem muhteşeeemmmm
========= SET LIST ========= 🎶 "THE GREATEST" at 0:23 🎶 "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE" at 6:42 🎶 "i love you" at 11:50 🎶 "BIRDS OF A FEATHER" at 18:26
I was hoping she'd do the high note in Birds of a feather, but she didnt🥲
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THIS TINY DESK?😂 6:19
Can we talk about the drummers Stank Face?
NPR is doing great job !!! Love this !!
I live for these. 🐥🤍
Faltou um pouco mais de ensaio e talvez um trompete, mas pra uma primeira experiência acústica achei bem legal , espero que continuem ! Deve ter sido uma experiência incrível pra eles
God, she’s just incredibly talented.
Incredible <3
Can we talk about the way Finneas looks at Billie when she sings
Plangent and plaintive.
what i envy most, they are both siblings, i never get along with my siblings, my brother always causes trouble, he has been in prison four times. he has destroyed the family TT
Have Tiny Desk already been nominated for a Grammy for Sound Engineering? If not, its about time!
The audio is so crispy 🤯 love it 😍
Yeah
she looks so pretty, her voice fits acoustic so well and its pretty soothing
Is there a reason npr don't upload anything to spotify?
If I could like this a gazillion times I would! 🎉
What a beautiful show!! Absolutely love watching and listening to Billie, Finneas, and the band. AMAZING 🤩 Might have shed a few tears but very worth it 🥹 It was a joy to watch and see her at the NPR Tiny Desk studio this time ☺️ THE VOCALS, THE SETTING, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WAS PERFECT 🥰🤩⭐️✨💫
this comes at a perfect time. ❤️‍🩹 i just lost my dad to cancer last week so this feels like a hug. 🫂 birds of a feather is that song for me. 🕊️🤍
Wait did they not remember they already had a tiny desk a couple years ago
This has made my day
Doing What's Right ❤
These two are profoundly talented, to write a song like "I love you" aged 16 and 21 is absolutely mind blowing. How blessed we are to live in a world where Billie & Finneas are creating music. Thank you Tiny Desk - this is up there with the greats.
🥰🥰🥰
i love her angelic voice
I want Finneas to get the credit that he deserves so bad!
Can’t believe this has 2milly views in 17 hours😮! 🙌! -mark (ps I’m an artist/comedian from 🇦🇺 who lost his kidneys at 5years old pls gimme a chance). I may even do a tiny desk gig in future. ✌️🩵🦾
Why isn't that guy named Andrums 😭
WOW!
OMG
Proving that music without aoutotune or lip synch is so mucht better.
❤🔥🫶🏽
I've heard of Billie ,but until now I never heard her music.  Incredible 😍
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
FINALLYYYYY
It's fantastic. I think Bilie/Finneas is one of the best things which happened in modern showbiz.
calls ROSÉ too 😭
Too short😭
I know they both work on the albums, but we need one album where they both provide the vocals - because they sound ETHEREAL together!!!
finally got a better quality version of the i love you note change 😭
THE SECRET VERSE IS SENDING MEEEE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN!!!!!”
Omg this literally made me cry, amazing
SHE'S SO TALENTED OMGGOMG
She said its one of our favorites, ans I knew INSTANTLY that it would be "i love you"
Tiny Desk, y'all need to add chapter previews for convenient replay purposes!
omggggg
요즘 NPR 폼 미쳤네...
Its my dream come true with i love you in this video. My favourite song for ever.
I love u Billie 💙
can something be more perfect than this?
This will def get the most views not even a day already 2m 😮
Amazing! The fact that she's still only a kid but sings and writes songs like she's lived a WHOLE life! So talented!
this version should be on spotify...
Rhythm section just destroyed everything, pure mayhem.
I love you billlie❤❤❤❤❤
The Best In Our Generation 🙏
How can I get this performance tattooed into my eyes?
Hermoso color de voz de Billie Eilish 😘👌
wow billie. Nice work. if it wasn't for my daughter I wouldn't have heard yor wonderous voice. go! make it real. sing to it.
Who else Like 👍🏼 before watching it 🫶🏼💚🫶🏼✨ 🥰😍
That first album is a modern masterpiece.
Sweetie Billie Eilish ❤❤❤❤
Excellent performance!

Tbh Tiny Desk is incomparable.👌 no auto tune just pure talent 👏
Amazing!!!!
I love you Billie Eilish don’t act so surprised

Somehow exactly what I've needed today. Thank you so much for carrying such an amazing feeling of music!
So this became one of my favorites tiny desk concerts EVER! ❤❤❤
the absolute voice of an angel (or two).
Jezz she's good. Almost as warm and special as Nina Persson.
Billie always reminds me of my ex, she really loved listening to her. I hope she sees this comment, I really miss her. Balik kana pls AHHAWHAWHAWHHAWHAW
I just adore when she sings live and changes up the songs a bit and hit different runs 😩 UGH SHES SO TALENTED
От её унылого скулежа сдохнуть хочется... Так и должно быть?
I love billie so much.  I hate ads SO MUCH.
Amazing
The definition of ear orgasms OMFG
Please upload the sessions on spotify or applemusic im dying
Why is the set list so short!?
I didn't know this would be so healing ♥
boring
better help shouldn't sponsor this!
Muhteşem bir sessin.  Farkli bir karakter olarak hayatımıza renk ve güzellik kattın.
love to see andrew still on the drums
If Simon saw this he would keep on sabotaging her because she's with eyes shut and passing by one of the most incredible musicians.
HIT ME HARD AND SOFT NEEDS AN ACOUSTIC VERSION. 😂😂😂
The production on this song is top-notch. The layers of instrumentation create such a rich sound that you can get lost in.
Finneas shouldve been mentioned i feel
Looking foward  to see Lauren Hills on Tinny Desk
Thank god!
gotta get Finneas on there next
She's the best ever..
Spent the whole time trying to find Mac Millers 'Don't Trip' hat in the background... Couldn't find it ☹....UPDATE: found it, shelf above Finneas' head 😍🥰🤩
piano guy's really into it
❤
Amazing ♥️♥️♥️ tnx Tiny Desk 🙏
Hermosamente triste ❤
Waouh le mec derrière a la batterie c'est Pierre-François Martin-Laval dans Rrrr abusé.
sweet home alabama
What a beautiful soul! Completely in love with this woman, her energy,  her sweetness, her spirit. Keep rocking on Billie and company.
I can't believe she touched the microphone. Tiny desks got this. 😂
Oh, Billie and Finneas, you both look amazing!
I need THIS version on Spotify😭🥹
“You’re good” 17:29
Which guitar did he used on the first song please?
Bruh got love tiny desk feel like artist put best foot forward dey snapped lol stay safe RIP Phil Lesh Quincy Jones pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze
finneas looks at her with so much love :(
Exquisite ❤
please don't advertise betterhelp.
I'm gonna be honest, Billie has one of those once in a generation voices, but this just seemed boring to me.  It could've been crazy epic but it seems flat for me. I'll get hate but that's my opinion ( who asked you!?!?) I know.
You want to make a man cry 😢 😂 ❤❤ take your 💐💐💐
Someone please tell her how to use a mic and how to stop mumbling.
This is truly heart opening - they are so dedicated and immersed, floating in their little clouds. This is how music should be.
MTvs unplugged. Tiny desk. Tiny Plug
8:29
love
Without pomp and naturally. Instant gold in all hearts.
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
The camera person loves Abe lol
I love you is one of my fave Billie songs. Her voice is so angelic I can't even believe it.
So how does one become an audience member to these things 🙈
So beautiful ! ❤

This was garbage
No había llorado tanto con un tiny desk neveeeer 😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Ad breaks mid song??? Rough spot
Absolutely breathtaking! ❤
She's so pretty :')
Why are you putting ads during the songs you absolute wallopers.
not betterhelp :(
If there will ever be a Twilight remake i would hope that Billie and Finneas would make the soundtrack
Finneas and Billie harmonies hit somewhere deep in the soul... 😵
amazing voice
i can't wait for the edits
Are you kidding me? Partnering with BetterHelp, really?
Hail billie
Will be listening to this contantly, just aquired new background music
The greatest
WHY Betterhelp?
What kind of guitar Finneas has?
That's a big f'ing tiny desk.

Until Trump administration pulls plug on funding. Then they'll sink or become commercial.
Finneas and Billie make dope music

The ads are really annoying in this one
Woah 😮
She is so hot omg
Omg please tell me you did one with Finneas and his own music as well
Oh wow an acoustic / orchestra album only of Billie and Finneas. I would never let my ears hear something different 🥺
Billie eyelash
First song is giving me _Crossroads_ vibes, an oldie by Don McClean.

SCREAMING THIS SOINDS AMAZINGGGG😍😍😍
this is too good, we need an unplugged version for these songs!
3:43 oh GOD she gave me goosebumps
te amo
no, i love you Billie
"I Love You" by Billie is a song that will always bring me to tears. I lost a very important person to cancer, slowly watching them deteriorate, but I had to hide my sadness and fear. I was probably around 13 or 14 years old at the time. I wish that when I was first told, it had been a joke and that he was never diagnosed with cancer. It was so hard not to break down in front of him and pretend everything was okay. The line “The smile that you gave me even when you felt like dying”fits so well because he always tried to smile and cheer me up, as if he could see right through me and understand how scared I was.   His hospital room faced Central Park, and during my first visit, I couldn't help but look out the window and cry. I had been told not to let him see me sad, but that day, I just couldn’t hold it back. Seeing him in that state, when he had always been so strong, was heartbreaking—it was as if half of the man he was had disappeared. I spent every night, before and after his passing, crying alone because I didn’t know how to share the grief or the pain I felt. But this song allowed me to express it. “I love you”from him felt like a final goodbye. :’( 12:27
❤❤❤❤❤❤ la amooooo
This video even gave chills to my cat 😂
Love Billie! This is very enjoyable to watch. Hi Billie and Finneas! Thanks for sharing this NPR, very nice performance by both! 👍😊
christmas came early, thank you TD team xx
no because my heart fell to the floor when she said the next song was i love you.
its so calming like what!?
its so calming like what!?
when is finneas getting another one please i beg😫
just good music
Blind point is trust
Woooo❤😗
greatest of all time!
WE LOVE YOU
so beautiful ❤
I am sick today, and I was litterally falling asleep with her voice. I cant express how much i love this person.
i loveee youu npr!!!
Im sorry but Finneas really needs to have his mic lowered. Thats not harmonizing.. thats shouting over her.. and its not even in tune.
I’m actually obsessed she’s so perfect to me
Upnext tiny desk concert : Nirvana Tribute
I love you too...❤😁
She lost weight ! Dang girl u cute
this version of L'amour de ma vie, is... wooooow. I want a acoustic album too.
In the actual Tiny Desk now and not just the print out of the set! I waited too long for this.
Dropping this 6 days after doechiis tiny desk is insane. Tiny desk is amazing. Thank you npr
Te amo meu cristal 😊❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤❤❤❤
Love this!!! finally some proper music in the charts.
i love her so bad, shes so cute🥹
I'm here for Finneas' talent
We’ve been waiting for so long for this!❤
Billie one of the best singer of this generation
Wow. Just wow
musiałam wyłączyć, nie moge znieść tego fałszu
Wooooooo
💙💙💙💙
love itttttttttttttttt
I thought I’d waited too long for this and now I’m realizing I would’ve waiting another lifetime and a half if that’s what it had taken. Her vocal vibrato is like no other. Billie & Finnie 5ever
Tiny Desk Concert is the reason I pay for YouTube premium.
"I love you" still feels like the first time  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Her singing technique clearly leaves her out of breath after like every sentence so its always impressive when I see her sing in smaller more intimate settings where she has to focus a lot more to sound consistent. Beautiful performance! ❤
i will never get over how angelic Finneas and her sound together
So smooth, voice like honey
This kinda set up is always suit her voice cozy and calm
bad guy in 50% my love, ocean eyes in 80% and in tiny desk concert in all my love you billie eilish.
Woooo
I love this
Wow i love you recognition we win
Thank you tiny desk for this amazing show😞🙏❤️
She is neat.
can she do an annually tiny desk like fr i need all of her songs with this touch
tiny desk doing it bigg
They somehow told the story of my past year with this playlist <3 incredibly beautiful <3
The fact that this performance wasn’t 40 minutes is the only disappointing element.
So intense, I stop breathing when I listen to Billie 😊
Esto es increíble.. ❤
Thank you for the little Tiny Desk @ pandemic. This is the revanch of that one but that one at the pandemic was so precious
She is like mac Miller, such beautiful and chill voice, i love you Billie from Moçambique🇲🇿❤️✊
replay the “i looove youuuuuuu” part like 20,000 times 🥺🤍
10/10
So GOOOD!
I live thisss but sorry this version of greatest just doesn’t hit.
ad placements in the middle of a song is beyond criminal
Isnt betterhelp still being underprepared?
L'Amor stripped back like this shows it in a different (and more appealing) light. Always love seeing Tiny Desks for artists ever since hearing Adele's performance
she lives in every song
Was expecting more there was pretty boring
did finneas retake guitar in a 1st verse song?
I LOVE YOUUUUUU 15:58
Skinny Eilish put on just as incredible of a show as Thickie Eilish. Billie always slays. 🤩
빌리사랑해❤❤❤❤
My God!!! So good. Like honey. Thanks for that. 💚
Discovered Tiny Desk (fulltime) from my ex, he and I both loved Billie and seeing this reminds me of him and the good times we did have together.. it's been 5 months and it still hurts.
Im melting away... no one save me cause this might be Heaven.
This year has been great for tiny desk, Chappell, Doechi, and Billie? Let's go ladies!!!
This made me cry smile and cry again 🙂‍↕️
absolutely captivating
❤
Vinyl please.
Everybody going crazy over I Love You, while the whole time Birds Of A Feather is the one
I’m so happy she performed L’amour De Ma Vie🤍🤍
can't believe I CAN watch this show this year. Thank you Billie~
BILLIE X TINY DESK! I REPEAT BILLIE MF EILISH X TINY DESK!!! EVERYONE STAY CALM!
Im melted 😌😌
Puede alguien poner el track list así me ahorro 20 seg de mi vida. Gracias
Was waiting for wildflower 😢😢😢😢
QUÉ CLASE DE AGUINALDO NAVIDEÑO!!!  🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🔥🔥🔥💗😍🥰
Omg she did i love you i got chills
Mucho blanco por la zona
She is a STAR and The Tiny Desks is universe of music
THE GREATESEEEESSSTTTT
i’m literally crying
if billie eilish made acoustic jazz music like this and released it she'd be my number 1 most listened artist
putting an ad while Billie's introducing her band was diabolical
I just can't ❤❤❤❤❤
she is so amazing
The Greatest is killing me in the best way
🎶💯♥️🙏🏼
Billieee 🥺🥺🥺 Finneas 🥺🥺🥺
“i’m dressed like a girl” baby it’s just a white shirt… we all wore that for school uniform 😭🤣
girl!!!!!!!!!! stop making me cry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Billie Eilish's vocal performance is truly unique. Her pitch accuracy, exceptional expressiveness, and sensitivity are remarkable. As always, the sound recording is incredible. Kudos to the musicians who accompany this unique artist with such talent ❤
Their vocals sound SOOO good together wow
New wave's talented girl🎉 My daughter loves her till die❤
Wow
so boring
tiny desks need to be published on spotify
She did note change in I love you again. 15:55 beautiful.
mad respect to everyone involved ❤️
Why does listening to Billie Eilish songs remind me of the game Tha Last Of Us?
Wow how wonderful.  I love everything about this set; that Billie was nervous but still shone like a star, how obvious it is how much brother and sister care for each other (and what a marvellous song-writing pair they are!) and the pure vulnerability in each song shared.  I felt like I was floating as I  listened.  Thank you so much.  ❣
I’m so obsessed w/ her and Finneas’s dynamic. He’s such a good brother, I feel like he’s always checking up on her
Oh my God... Crying from first minute 😭😭😭😭
Was hoping she would have the same girls who did the backing vocals in her live videos 🥲
この空気感こそTiny deskの真髄だよね。Billieの声エグすぎる。
The random ads in the middle of songs like cmon 😭
Another level!
love this format
Billie❤ the voice of an angel
The greatest? Ateeee❤😊😊
Te amo te amo te aml
omg billie you so beautiful...
Wow
My Glorious Queen
I LOVE YOU BILLIE.
My brother as if we don't know.❤❤❤
“tiny desks are becoming the new mtv shows” no, these are the new AOL sessions!
I was hoping for when the party’s over acoustic but lord yah know what this is wonderful lol
7:30 WOWWWW HE’S BEAUTIFUL OMG
letsgoooo
everyone finally realizing the amount of control billie has over her voice, thank you. she’s spoken a lot this year about jazz/soul music being her main vocal inspiration, and taking vocal lessons for the last few years to improve her range and breath placement. her AMEX interview about birds of a feather also showcases her clear she is about her CHOICES to include softer, breathier vocals sometimes, because she’s conveying emotion rather than trying to “prove” she can “sing”.
Packing enough adds in? Could probably get a few more in.
Astounding!!!!!!!!🐢☮️🪐🚀🎈🌍🪐🚀🪐☮️
Her voice is wonderfulllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllli
zayn malik tiny desk concert plss
Beautiful
wish they couldve toned down finneas’ mic just a teeny bit more
Chills!!! Acoustic takes it to a different intamatesy ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THE WAY SHE SANG WHILE SWINGING ON THAT CHAIR...CHEFS KISS!
the last song has that lokey "keep bleedin love"-leona lewis vibe
sitting here smiling
I didn’t realise she could actually sing, my hat goes off to her. Normally these Pop groups are just hype but she has a great voice and this is actually real music being played.
dua, doechii and billie back to back!!! y’all need to get FLO on here next 😭💙
the sound of live instruments and the voice of the beautiful Billie luv luv luv🥰
noooo NPR how could you take a sponsorship from better help 😢
"Only a million views? Must have just dropped."
Hey beautiful
IMAGINE how out of this world it's gonna be whenever billie does superbowl halftime.
4:13 Oh man, that transition 😍
Billie and finneas are so good at singing it’s insane xx
Love you😘😘😘
not even close to touching mac millers npr spot
I'm crying because I'm so happy 🥹❤
no, because chappell's wig on the shelf gagged me too
Well this was underwhelming
Liked before I watched
Her voice is like candy to my ears. ❤
I’m hoping she is ok do yall she what is on like her elbow
thanks billie i did need the reminder that i love you is one of your best and needs to be on. rotation immediately
шикардос
The video description is soooo good.
te quiero con locura
might end up as tiny desks most watched
Billie mereces todos los putos Grammy 🎉
LITERALLY GONNE LISTEN TO THIS WHILE SLEEPING
I do not know any of these songs but I thoroughly enjoyed this performance. She's brilliant. Thank you NPR
they did so phenomenally well, i’m so proud of them ❤️‍🔥🌋 i only cried 3x we all good
I need a christmas albummmm
New fav the greatest performance just dropped
TI AMO
The pianist gives Ryan Gosling vibes...
Beautiful - what talents - loved every moment. Proof that the girls are blowing it away (Billy, Aurora, Dodie y Pacifica excellent at the moment).
be quiet, excellence is happening
14 HOURS AGO????
Godddddddddddd
can her brother stay home for once
Nepo baby.
😮
Nah, great voice but boring performance. 😴😴😴
😍😍😍
I love listening to Billie Eilish sing.
EVERYTHING IS MORE THAN FLAWLESS! And I absolutely LOVE how she dressed here!
ugh I can’t wait to watch this every day for the rest of my life 💜💜💜
tiny desk loves its audience, expansive and always listening. each new one is a free gift. if i get real money someday, i’ll support NPR and PBS
Simplemente Wow
Wow❤! Whomever is bringing these artists deserves a raise!!!
Upload in 4K
im trying to fall asleep to this but the applause keeps waking me up
Thanks
This is one of my dreams
Gosh I’ve never seen her so nervous!!!!
Are you kidding me i get live Charli xcx and now Billie Eilish 1 day after the other after ordering my 2 wine bottles? Wow
Omg Such incredible Talents!🥹🥹i wish Billie and finneas could do concerts in Africa too sometimes I definitely wouldn’t miss😂much love from Ug🇺🇬❤
Finneas and Billie You both are angels. Love you both! I Always feel all the love that your parents put inside of you! Thank you Timy Desk for this video.
Absolutely beautiful
didn’t even finish l’amour before booking a tattoo appointment and getting it on my body
BOYCOTT Billie for Palestine ✌️🙏
Best acoustic version ❤
💙💙💙
thankyou billie!!💙🫂
I didn't realize til now but "l'amoure..." is suuuuch a Sinatra throwback. Tongue and cheek but poetic.
Who would’ve thought the little girl I found singing ocean eyes would become one of our generations greatest artists 😭
I love how Billie always refers to the albums as ‘our albums’ and includes FINNEAS in everything. Love. ❤
I am admittedly one of those who didn’t know how good she really is before this. Her voice is heavenly. Im glad I tuned in!
always the BEST !
to all those people that made me doubt she could sing: 🖕
BEST OF THE BESTEST. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
FINALLY
Reminded me of Chappell and Olivia's performance. Very good performance.
Malaysia fans🙋‍♀️
These commercials milking it for all they can
i cried
She’ll be remembered even a hundred years from now. Incredible. ❤
每個表情，每次吸氣，都是豐富複雜的表達。
The fact that she sang The Greatest first tells me she loves me cuz that's my fave 🥹
glad that npr brought billie back to the channel and this time, in front of a live studio audience 🥹 i’m soooo proud of billie’s progress
I love how simple her beauty is in this
Quel talent! C'est fou! Comment bien commencer la journée ? En écoutant ça 👌
Amazing performance! ❤️‍🔥
two of the best artists of our generation
❤
NAAAAAH ME MATAS CON I LOVE YOU 12:12
Hopefully she and Finneas will ever be a team
I got headphones on and the quality is qualitying 🎧
She makes me cry ❤ 🥹
billie on tiny desk!!! it’s about time
🇧🇷!
Watching billie in white is so clean, bless my eyes, she's goddessssssssssssssh
Fell in love with Billie again. : (
What about Chihiro? 😢
absolutely no one does it like billie
get charlie xcx to tiny desk!
Billie love you❤
🥲 I said u~ woowoo,,
역시 빌리 라이브 최고야 들을때마다 행복해진다❤ 최고의 가수 아름다운 목소리 빌리❤ 늘 응원해 고마워
betterhelp? in 2024? yall. what are you doing? you know they are terrible.
I will be hated. Yes, they are so gifted and talented and they worked hard, her voice is angel alike BUT these songs are sooooo boring!
3:43 you kinda feel this part under the skin
Sos tan dulce Billie te amo!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
The way her brother was looking at Billie was so lovelyyyy🥰
I love how Finneas is looking at Billie as she’s singing, especially during I love you.  Looks like he’s maybe trying to calm her nerves and keep her grounded
She’s so amazing I can’t take it
I love you❤
Que voz tiene BIllie la puta madreeeee!!!
额滴神呐这就是天籁
ily!!!!
Wow! NICE!!!! You're in my top 3 faves so far. Meg Myers being my all time fave Tiny Desk due to it being Meg F'n Myers! :)
We need a tiny desk of Finneas 🥺🙏
OMG!!!
If no one has said this yet, if you love this please consider donating to your local public radio station. Billie is a national treasure but NPR is what made this possible
Billie and Finneas are amazing!!!
❤
Can we talk about that vibratos!,!! 🤯❤️
This is about to do numbers
Now Ms Billie, you didn't have to leave me sobbing😢❤❤
As a Memphian seeing that Tiny Bomb from Wiseacre Brewing is pretty based. Like I swear I’ve never noticed it before😌
I always appreciate when an artist does the same runs that are in the studio version. A lot of them simplify or completely skip over them. I love the intricate runs that are sprinkled throughout this album and props to Billie for performing them live!!
Not many artist touches such deep emotions in my soul, but Billie and Phineas burnes it down to soft coal, watering my tears with an extra touch of salt, brings this moment to an halt, smooth brings in my day, start my routine, but wont stay long away.....love! ❤
I'm at Minute 5 and crying. So moving
Just wow!! 👏👏❤️
Simply Billie eilish ❤
Ok YouTube, here I am, you won
shoulda kept her political opinions to herself don't ya think
The quality of this all together is😱
This is giving me same feeling as watching MTV Unplugged
Their parents must be so proud of them
Magical
gracias gracias gracias gracias infinitas 💓
Maybe we need more of Finneas 👀
I LOVED IT THEIR VOICES MATCH PERFECTLY
My girl
This version of ‘I Love You’ is quite literally killing me. 💙
I love you was so devastatingly beautiful.
YO!!!BILLIE ITS A. I WILL SEE YOU WITH ALL HOPE WILLING. IN LESS THAN 24 . Rest well. This is a point in my life. I've been so happy looking forward to seeing you,  hearing you. 😅😂😂🎉❤😊
i love the way finn looks at billie during the performance
The voice is amazing ❤
No Skips She’s too good!
So boring. i was actually crying on the first some seconds and then still should i cry or what. And then im gona choose Tyla and dance. Sadness too much. Yeah but i still love this girl ❤❤❤❤
Wow. What a treat. Thank you tiny desk! Thank you billie and finneas!
"I love you" is my favorite song, thank you Billie Eilish
I can’t escape the way I love you
I love Billie Eillish but she would be the death of me that's why I am avoiding her at all costs
Super love happy nervous proud billie!
I could listen to her sing all day
I can’t stop listening to the how she sings the ending of Lamour at 9:54. Her voice is so beautiful 🫠
You should invite Cristian Castro.
much love, Billie!
you had me until you were singing about birds
Hey there’s an awesome person watching this rn you know who u r
I love you in this, its like heaven bruh
This is my brother by the way""
Every song from her sounds exactly the same.
She is so good!! This was so great
How perfect voiceeee im craying  😭😭
This is my favorite performance :3
i love their sibling dynamic
her little giggles during iloveu im crying
being named solo as a musician is crazy coincidental and cool
0:23 THE GREATEST  6:44 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 I LOVE YOU 18:28 BIRDS OF A FEATHER
Sad that someone with such raw talent has to dumb it down and overproduce her music to get famous
i have listened to this over 4 times and have cried every time.. what do you expect from me?!
Any Billie Fans?
It's Billie Eilish
She’s is such an amazing performer! I got to see her tour yesterday and it was just amazing! She’s a one of a kind performer and that voice! I so happy she controlled ticket cost on Ticketmaster for her fans!
Pure magic
did I cry? yes. are we surprised? absolutely not.
L'Amour De Ma Vie is literally my favorite
I love this.
oh they did lamour for ME
The emotion in her voice … I can’t!! It’s what makes her music so good
CAN WE STOP TAKING AD REVENUE FROM BETERHELP ITS A COMPLETE SCAM
Blown away... Billie and Finneas have both grown so much as musicians and performers
that harmonization on the greatest 🤌🏻
Putting an ad in the middle of aSong is deranged
She played I love you🥺 ah I love her sm and her voice. Billie and Finneas has made it so far
Я очарован!!! Она прекрасна!!!
She sounds amazing on her albums but somehow sounds even better here? 👏👏 so good
Omfg she did I LOVE YOU?!
What do you mean you have wanted to be here for your whole life? Isn’t this your third (second onsite) time?
Last song tho 😂
not me crying 30 seconds in
Can we pleaseeeeeeee get the tiny desk versions of all the artist that have perfomed here!!!! They are pure music magic!!!!
I can't believe I spent years not being a fan. Her voice is gorgeous
I waiting for this ❤
Actually started crashing out when she said the words “I love you”
Who else wished for wildflower?
You know what I’m not a musical analyst or anything but somehow “i love you” is similar to “hallelujah” does anybody else hear/feel it????
But better help? I appreciate the concern for mental wellness, but not through them. It’s established on smaller channels that they are not the right sponsor choice
4:12 🐚🍃🍃🍃
love u billie! hoping to see you soon pls do asia tour 😢
Was way too short... This live feels way shorter than all the others ❤❤❤
ok. i am dead
Literally my favorite tiny desk in around  a decade
I was so excited to watch this. You are THE GREATEST billie!
seems like shes on vocal rest.
It must be crazy to be the musicians backing Billie.  Trying to focus on your own performance while she is doing her thing must take real effort.  I am pretty sure I would get lost in its beauty and miss my cues on every song!
Unbelievable!  Great sounding
this has made my year fr
I’m personally at 100 views! 💙🤍💙🤍
Yang Maha Memberkati
15:58 ✨i looOve you✨
Clairo next plllleeeeeeasase
Guyssss, she's taking it 📯
Nirvana - Smells Like Teen?
love your music my love
It’s before 1:00pm not past 1:00pm, Billy.
SHE DID I LOVE YOU OMFG
She sounds so much better with real instruments.
there was no need to put the commercials between the songs, NO NEED
Love ❤❤❤
❤💙🤍💙❤
I wish all the best to everyone.
❄️
Te amo Billie❤
Her voice is just so beautiful like how could you not love to hear her sing especially live
Enakk bangett 😭
Wow.  Score.  Love her.
i was thereee it wass cool !!
Amazing
I love you Billie my new favorite live performance ❤
Wow. Incredible
SINGING i love you is such a crime but I am thankful at the same time
Doechii now Billie Eilish  These performances are amazing
YOOOOO THE BROWN ROOTS!!!!
Thanks Billie  😢❤🎉
First song perfect at 1.15x speed
I LOVE U
te amo billie sos lo mejor que me pudo haber pasado desde los 13 hasta acá
was i the only one to cry during "I love you" ?
They are the best in the world ❤🎉
Someone in the TinyDesk Team is definetely cooking.
the tear during i love you
Love you Billie ❤❤❤❤
Like para parte dos😩👌🏽
8:07
Te amo billie ❤
Since getting great headphones, I enjoy and find more value in Tiny Desk than actual concerts. This was awesome.
My wife online
7:22
TE AMO PRECIOSOTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
so beautiful
Her and Finneas are so talented
I know my ex situationship is the type of Billie Eilish fan to keep coming back to this video so I just wanna say:  You're such an immature person and don't deserve to be a fan of such a talented human being 🤍
ELA CANTANDO I LOVE YOU MDSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Love you Billie!!❤❤❤
love billie but sad to see that tiny desk is no longer tiny these days
A true angel superstar 👼🏻❤️⭐️
I love you
kamu sangat gokil 😍🥺
why is there a rag on the drum?
L’amour getting its time to shine
The snare drum sound of my dreams
!!! How did i not know that Billie Eilish has such an incredible voice until now?  I've heard all of her most popular songs just because they are everywhere ... but hearing her perform acoustically and live, I'm so blown away to discover how smooth, textured, nuanced, colorful, soft, sharp, gentle, and mature-beyond-her-years she sounds.  That vocal control and style is something else.
NAILED IT
😤😤😤💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Magnificent
Then you move done
I’m a 53 year old man, and this speaks to my inner tween heart.
omfg now I want even more the jazz/christmas album OH PLS😣😩🙏💕
The way Billie and Finneas look at each other is so beautiful. You can tell they genuinely love and admire one another. 🩷
Chihiroooooooooo😢
did I break your heart¿?
What a gift on these dates... my respects
Love❤
This was nice. Band synced perfectly to Billie’s singing.
Idol💜💙💜💙
O love that
I WISH YOU THE BEST
wowza
She said she's been wanting to do this her whole life like she wasn't there just four years ago 😂
😊💫💫💫👍
they are both such incredible singers and complement each so well! thank you for the beautiful performance! ❤
Please give Brakence a tiny desk spot. PLEASE
billie❤❤
i cant unhear billie crying in i love you
Great episode. She is adorable and a wonderful singer.
2:14  wow, just wow
2:14  wow, just wow
Hate how I can't like this a thousand times already😭😭❤
کاش یک ساعت بود آدم از بیلی و فینیس خسته نمیشه❤😢
Still obsessed with this 🥰
Just imagine in a couple of years we will come back to this and be like ahh man I wish she could’ve played this song if it was out yet
te amo mi reina, que voz tan hermosa.
hits DIFFERENT when ur billie timeline starts at  Don't Smile at Me days
Te amo mi reina, que voz tan hermosa!
I’m crying 😭
Done so beautifully ONCE AGAIN ❤️❤️❤️
I feel good 💚🎶
no offense to Billie but this was the most mid tiny desk ever. Her songs are carried by the production, and that's fine. But this wasn't it
This is one of the best besides Chappell 😭😭
Thank you for every single TD. This is the new unplugged. Incredible.
ahh i wish it was longer ):
Cómo puede ser tan linda esta chikita carambas!!! T amo BilliElliot  =) =) =)
Get mk.gee
What mic is that, she’s using? Please/thank you 🎙️🎧
She is the most naturally beautiful person I’ve ever seen.
Her vocals are so clear and perfect
Sayang Billie 🤍
The first time I fell in love with her was Tiny Desk!!
21:11 I love how’s she’s honest about her never being able to belt that same note she did for the studio version.
NEW FAN HERE !!!
Billie ❤
i'm shaking to see you here!!! You've made it Billie and Finneas!!! What a gift!!
The Greatest as the first song completely wrecked me thank you so much
El Tiny de Paco y Catriel ha sido el más viral de los últimos años del canal de Tiny Desk desde el de Justin Timberlake. Seguro que este también será parte de los Tiny Desk de más de 15 millones
There's so much out there about artists who synthesize and auto-tune everything. What a treat to hear real, genuine, heartfelt talent.
The best always 🫶🏼🫶🏼
Just two minutes in and it is already so beautiful <3 So full of emotions.
Tiny desk, big music.
Literally played all my fav songs, made me cry and smile so much, thank you Billie ☺️🥹🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The BEST early Christmas gift ever
I already love her music. But this simpler intimate setting sounds so crisp and amazing! Thank you! So nice to see them sing together!
i love you sayangkuuuuuu
Far out Billie. Your in my relevance of my music's to listen too. Thanks 😊
Why do I use Internet ? Because of this one! ❤❤
I LOVE YOU BILLIEEEEE & FINNEAS
this is like the new MTV Unplugged and i love it
Only thing left is to get Kanye West on Tiny Desk
so good.  didn't want it to end.
NUNCA q eu esperava ily
her voice is soo rich, she sounds like a harmony. don't know if I make sense
how come no one talks about her being a complete disrespect to humanity
9:08 she sounds just like her old self here <3
something about having her sing I love you in a studio setting allll these years after its release has me in literal tears 😭 😭
They are so gorgeous
Te amo mor!❤
What a gorgeous sound! ❤
We need an acoustic album asap
Impresionante lo que está mujer provoca con su voz
❤❤❤
❤
omg
This isn’t that good…
22 min was not enough we need more
22 minutes and 35 seconds of goosebumps ❤
now sabrina carpenter pleaseeee
Dude...the bridge of the greatest. I think I prefer this version to the original...I love the original as well but it has 2 different vibes. The rock version feels angry and passionate, and this jazzy and acoustic b version sounds sad and knowing the situation sucks and it feels almost like you're accepting it. I'm not sure how to describe it but it feels so different and I prefer this version, plus the "oohs" in between phrases really sounds cool. Her head voice also sounds less breathy and I love this sound so much.
all the songs she do!  0:22 - 5:46 : THE GREATEST 6:43 - 10:18 : L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:23 - 16:49 : i love you 18:27 - 21:57 : BIRDS OF A FEATHER
bro is playing drums with spaghetti
BAGUS BANGETTTTTTTTTT WOY. You guys are GOATs
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As músicas deles são de machucar o coração
AAAAAAAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Meow meow meow meow. Where is it??????!!!!
Her voice control is insane just wow
I love you bills❤
Shout out to finneas for always being there, i love your music bro❤
It's so adorable to see a brother so supportive of her sister
Ads in the middle of a song is infuriating.
🙌 so good
Much of her music is so hauntingly beautiful.  She gives vibes of great songstresses from the past.
Its pop up on my screen. Omg im excited!!!!❤❤❤
she makes it seem so easy
It’s a beautiful day 🤩 love to see it❤
Can we have Evanescence on Tiny Desk?
Thank you all for dressing up visiting my hometown :)
The fans who love a Billie note change are being FED today
Been waiting for this....
❤❤❤ album of the year, song of the year. I don’t think I could love her more.
Npr no longer highlighting artist that people should listen to
4:14 MAN AM I THE GREATEST 😭😭😭😭
She sounds soooooo good 😭😭
Why she bring her whole band? I like the tiny desks that are solo
Impecable en absolutamente todo, te adoro billie
the way finneas complements her voice beautifully is fascinating, even more so in i love you
Absolutely beautiful, now everyone go check out fred again's tiny desk
Someone get this audio team over to SNL immediately
i'm always so impressed by Tiny Desk audio quality ❤
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
maldito tiny desk increible
🖤
billlllieeeeeee i love youuuuu
Vem pro Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🫶
The modern day version of the Carpenters. They harmonize effortlessly.
A maior
❤❤❤
I was waiting for wildflower 😢
i love you being sung here?? i'm crying....
Oh my goodness I can’t believe she did “i love you”!!! That’s one of my favourites!
Wow
So captivating.
Birds of a feather. 💙 🇲🇽
😮
omg ive been wishing for this for years
utterly jawdropping
It’s crazy and a love hate relationship with billies old album because it carried me through a very tough point in my life , but still listening now I can finally appreciate those dark times and smile at my growth now . ❤ both such a great song writer
the greatest indeed ❤❤❤❤
I was Here
This gives me the same feeling as the first time I heard their music... I think this the closest thing to magic we have
Wow.
Lo mucho que te amo Billie
Te amo billie ❤
billie ure so fawking amazing.. i love you so much, bil.
billie and finneas are both amazing individually. but together, its a no... idk
The bum bum bum actually had me in a chokehold
Very good! I needed this!
i love you and the greatest. gosh I love it
Absolutely amazing.  👏👏👏
billie’s acoustic versions are always special to me 🥹🫶
obsessed with the vocals🫶🏼
I'm officially a Billie Eillish fan🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love her like innocently from the bottom of my heart
Sublime
Boring Eilish 😴😴
Billie is absolutely out of this world talented
this is incredible wow
People don’t understand the vocal range and difficulty it is to sing her style the way she does. She makes it look effortless but, it. is. soooo. HARD. her and fin are living a dream doing what they love together. Tiny desk stays being top freakin tier with how they produce these. Keep it up.
Awesome
Muita coisa!!!!!!!!!!!!
queenie vibes
i’m so happy she sang i love you. one of my all time favs ❤
She’s the best singer of the century to me. No doubt
love the description for ''saudade''
Dios la amo tanto
Love love love
Can we all give a moment for Finneas' hair? It looks GORGEOUSSSS
Billie's voice is heartbreaking. Thank you so much for this incredible set. Such a warm and beautiful stripped down sound from the band.
Her voice is so well-controlled.. sounds beautiful🙏🏽
La amoooo❤❤❤❤
Billie Elish tiny desk sesion + new Kevin Karl’s song what a day for a music 🙏🏻
Release a jazz album already! ❤
Wow!  Special stuff right there.
She is so unique.  To me she is a one of a kind, like Billy Holiday was.  Finneas is also unreal.
Tiny Desk sometimes takes already famous pop stars and reveals them to be generationally talented artists of the highest order. And so it is with Billie (and Finneas!). Just stunning.
ily is easily in her top 10
Mas que merecidas las mas de mil millones 🎉🎉 2026 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
9:27 that "so hard" did in fact hit hard
Cryin' a lot with this one. Such a beautiful and perfect session of tiny desk.
It's sad that most of the world can't digest good music and real talent in its pure state as presented here on Tiny Desk, they need the music industry to turn it into over engineered junk food for mass consumption. Every artist I've seen on Tiny Desk sounds infinitely better than what gets laid down in the studio and put on the radio.
sooooooo prettyyy im obsesssssssssssssed
ZzzzzZ
Nah ff this z1onist artis.
Billie: Make it simple
What—she didn't break in to say that she stands with all the fans who were hurt by the results of the 2024 election, that men should be able to be members (no pun intended) of women's sports teams, just follow your heart . . . ?
My Spotify wrapped was right
did she leave something behind?🥺
she has a way of captivating your heart
Was she shy?
This hits..
i need her
No chihiro? 😢
the greatest It was so disappointing 😢 but i love you billie
Stunning ❤
Out of breath
Billie ahhhh
I love how she doesn’t gaf. The music speaks for itself.
nobody should be taking sponsorships from betterhelp anymore, we all know they're a suspicious company
❤wow
This is gonna be Tiny Desk’s #1 most watched
dying❤
i will never get tired of her voice, she sounds like heaven
I love you Billie!
Awe Billie’s voices sounds all scratched in birds of a feather 😢 she’s been singing for so long
Tiny desk clapped so much for this performance, and it was so so justified.
This is insane
cried the entire time
Yall be dropping these like its nothing ❤‍🔥
Billie forgetting they’ve done tiny desk before 😂 6:24
yeah this made my NIGHT. i love these two so much and i have for years. this is such a great example of what artists can be when they have more control over and stability in their lives and careers. their bond makes this all the more special🥹!
Te amo Billie ❤️‍🩹
It seems like Christmas comes earlier and earlier every year
Playing 15 ads throughout this video should be a crime.
This and the Marias on the same bill.  Knockout.
How did she never have a tiny desk until now I am appalled and grateful
Blessed be today as I woke up to The Witcher 4 trailer and now Billie's concert at the very beloved Tiny Desk
I think its definitely clear from this performance that the peak of Billie's artistic talent continues to rise! It's so amazing to see her collaborate with her brother to bring some of the defining music of this generation
One of the best tiny desks these two eyes have ever seen.
I love you is my favorite song😭❤️
am I just high or is this so satisfying to watch?
Fell asleep
😍😍😍
Giving chills honestly... She's so much clean vocally.. excellent breath control.. her next album gonna surpass HMHAS..
So Amazing
billie x finneas forever bringing tears to my eyes
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Vinyl? 😍
Go Abe!!!
How do people find out about these tiny shows? I wanna go!!!
La voz de Billie Eilish es tan hermosa.
woooow!!
Long awaited tiny desk concert!!! Love her!!!
I cried during I love you.
❤❤❤❤❤
Their energy together is unmatched! I’m feeling it through the screen ♥️
can someone tell me what number 1 she meant?  where? Hot 100 this week (as of this video was released) is the queen of xmas as usual? Did i miss something?
I usually tune in for one song from an artist but for Billie eilish ... GIRLlll say less ! its on repeat ❤❤❤
her voice & those emotions <3
Anyone watching in Polska?!
Tiny desk please have Jewel and Regina Specktor
This has been a loooooong time coming!!!! 🩵
Just started, here's to hoping birds of a feather is on here 🤞🏾
The way Finneas always watches her when she sings 'I love you' 🥺
Gosh been waiting for this. Billie and Finneas you are pure magic, I dream to see you live ❤
WOW. Her vocals are insane.
im not okay
didnt play most of her good songs =(
Billie Eilish has the voice of an angel.  She's absolutely captivating.
finally my fav songs!!!   11:52 i love you 18:27 birds of a feather
Like always, Billie sounds like heaven personified. 💙  I took my 8 year old daughter to see Billie's concert in Nashville, TN and she did not disappoint. My daughter LOVES Billie and it's easy to see why. What a sweet soul. I also love Finneas, so talented.
Billie’s vocals???????????? Next level talent
The end of i love you has such a chokehold on me istg
Looking for the time stamp comments
TE AMO BILLIE
DEMON
It used to be PBS back in the day. You saw some amazing music on there. Now it’s Tiny Desk. Please don’t stop. Make music something that needs to be preformed with the true intent of music. ❤
She seems like a different person here. The gimmicky stuff doesn’t suit her. She’s natural, not dressed outrageous. This will make more people listen to her.
Billie is not my top artist but she definitely has incredible talent. 🔥💯 “I love you” is by far my favorite song.
Ughhh this is what we needed
Love it. Please have Rosie <3
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nothing beats the energy and the vibe when finneas is there
Listening to her always heals my soul ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Billie if you see this, you are amazing, so talented and just the greatest of all time. We love you too girly 🐐 11:52
She is gorgeous
amazing❤
These two are the greatest songwriters of our generation, hands down. Absolutely incredible musicians. ♥️
My daughter is a fan. And so am I. And Finneas is ok too 🤍
18:52
you finally got your real tiny desk billie, i know that covid tiny desk made u so sad 🥺🫶🏻
This is the New VH1 unplugged...awesomeness
❤❤❤
Before I watch, I just want to say I hope this becomes my new #1 TDC
I LOVE YOU AHHHHH😢😢😢😢😢
Anyone else wish the background was blurred?
FREAKING SO GOOD  WOWOWOWOWOWOW
SHE DOES I LOVE YOU NO WAYYYYY😍
Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso is addicting
Wow
Is this a good time to say I haven’t heard I love u  👉👈
💘💘
3:29 the piano my god ❤❤❤❤❤
Billie, this was so soothing, I was depressed.💯🎶😌 I can't afford a concert, so thanks for this.🫶❤ Big love from DC. PS, you and your bro voices harmonize so well.✨
I'm in disbelief that she hasn't done a tiny desk sooner!
Piano GOAT
so good
Great Tiny Desk, but please - do your research on BetterHelp. They have a laundry list of disgusting problems that should be addressed.
The way finneas looks at Billie ❤️❤️ sibling lovee 💕💕
Glad they had an upbeat song to end. It was getting depressing. Her new stuff seems to sound the same.
FINALLY
Sweet baby jesus
Please put this set on all music platforms.  This was sooo good!
I love this
Starting with The Greatest gave me chills, then she executed it like her own Silent Library version lol I looooove it
About time ❤️
and wildflower??😭💗
Bring Rose Blackpink
i wish it was longerrrr
Do you know Djavan, from Brazil? he is incredible!
10 hours… 10 million views… Yep
Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
I love Billie and Finneas for years and Im impressed that they are just getting better and better, just when you wonder what else can they do? and they just come and amaze everyone with this new album
Maybe Billie Eilish and Finneas would be a better title.
so 3 musicas ??????????????????? A NAO
The best ❤ seeing Finneas And Billie together is just everything ❤
why she hates chihiro?
I should’ve known birds of a feather was going to play 😭 now I’m crying, love that song
New fan, she is awesome ❤
♥♥♥♥♥♥
원래도 팬이지만 이번 공연이야말로 빌리아일리쉬의 매력이 제대로 드러난듯
That note Billy sings at 12:26😵‍💫
I love you ❤
get ariana grande PLEASE
One of the greatest voices of our time.
This will become one of the epic series of all time in Tiny Desk no doubt!
a cada dia essa mulher supera
YEAH I JUST SCREAMED SO LOUD WHEN I SAW THIS
Chills
❤
❤️‍🩹
moro aqui nesse tiny desk a partir de hoje
Finneas has 2 solo albums, multiple awards and is more than just her brother 🙌🏽
I’ve been waiting for this omg. I knew it is good before I even clicked it
This is excellent.
My love
te voy a amar toda mi vida billie
THANK YOU TINY DESK!!!
Feel so immensely grateful to have been able to see her live, but I would absolutely love love  loveeeee to see her in a smaller/intimate/unplugged setting like this.
Me crying 12 seconds in even tho I’ve heard this song 100x.. acoustic is insane
It's impossible not to get emotional. It's the soundtrack of my life. 💙💙
This was amazing ❤
This is amazing. I just know this is gonna be on repeat for the next month at least
Los amo Billie y Finneas ❤
She’s so beautiful omg I just love how much she’s grown
very soothing
❤
WOW SE ME SALE EL CORAZÓN ♥ ♥
Probably greatest tiny desk performance since Mac Millers.
omg
i didn't know that i really need this Tiny Desk
tão delicada 🥹💗
Billie te amo, siempre lo voy a hacer
My wife
It felt like watching her live! ❤ Thank you Tiny Desk🎉
tiny desks are truly gems of the music industry, where else can we watch raw, tiny, intimate shows huh  god i love billie so much, what a loving human <3
Yessir
I LOVE U BILLIEEEEEEEEE
OMG! I would pay big bucks to see her perform an acoustic concert! This Tiny Desk concert was just AWESOME!!!! I am 65 years old, but who cares? Billy is extremely talented!!!!!
-Tatuaje en el cuello? -¡Sí!
WOWWW❤❤❤❤
2024 anyone?
uma aula de voz
🖤💚
She knows not to dress like biggie around black people lol
Thumbnail looks sooo  Avril Lavigne. Can't unsee
I'm sorry, a feel boried, I tried to stay.
This is like an advanced Christmas gift. Thank you, Billie
Both of their voices just sound so.. ethereal! Their harmonies are so good and flow so well together. Great tiny desk!
This should have been an hour-long, at least :')
Pure talent not only from Billie, but also from her brother and band. They all sound great
I JUST THREW MY PHONE WHEN SHE SAID "THIS SONG IS CALLED I LOVE YOU" I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH, Y'ALL COULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN 🥺
ASMR music 🥰
i love uuuuu
EARGASM!!!!
You can’t tell me she’s not an angel from heaven
Mother is looking well
Wow !
Billie & Finneas’ voices mixing >>>
não consigo acreditar que eu estava lá no lançamento do primeiro álbum, me apaixonei por "i love you" e depos de tantos anos, mesmo ja tendo participado do tiny desk uma vez, eles tocaram ela nesse ano. significa o mundo pra mim. ❤
❣️❣️❣️❣️
Been waiting for this for tooo long but it came at the perfect time 🙂‍↕️
hazme 3 hijos bili
god the billie x finneas harmonizing is so cool here
WE NEED A JAZZ ALBUM PLEASEEEEEEE
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So so good
in 24 hour this got 10 millon remember that
❤❤❤❤
Amazing vocals ❤
Tiny Desk is the best thing ever
Came here for the greatest and thats what played first❤❤❤❤
boom. period.
OMG YES FINALLYYYYYY YAYAYAYAY I WAS JUST AT HER CONCERT FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER BEING HER FAN FOR 8 YRS I LOVE BILLIE SMMMM <333  (and finneas ofc!!!)
PERIODDDDD
Relax
Amazing "I Love you"
I miss youtube premium, I miss being an essential worker, I miss not being unemployed, I miss the love we used to share, I miss our child, I miss not being on egg shells, I miss not being angry and depressed, I miss not having to turn to 🌽 and s3x over self deleting.   I miss wanting wedding bells. I miss not wanting to be in a coffin. To myself, I keep laughing. Make sure my face shows no tales. Let's have a wedding in Wales. Time's always fleeting, next moment guessing. Learning to know nothing. Embracing the silence. Misguided by science. I will forever stand in defiance. ✋👁️🤚
eu te amo tanto
I Didn’t Know How Bad I Needed This 🥹❤
I’d heard her songs before and enjoyed them, but this acoustic set officially made me fan.
Oh my god “i love you” was one of the first songs i latched onto off of wwafawdwg in 2019😭 the memories of listening to that in the car off of my iphone 6s sheeeesh
Hear me out she should make a jazz album
i fear you’ve absolutely smashed it my dear 👏🏼
What talent!❤
Who can resist billie, literally none.❤️💘
Just as it sounds in her recordings, Super talented = New Fan :D
her voice is truly angelic, so beautiful! >>and I also really need to know the name of her lipstick cause this is another level, does anyone have a guess??
Why did this feel like 3 minutes?
She is AMAZING
The better help sponsorship RUINSS the credibility of npr. Better help is awful
Why was I not notified about this
12:17 my brother never looking at me like that.
Absolutely LOVE getting to hear FINNEAS’ voice next to Billie’s. Usually it’s intentionally buried a bit more in production but this is 🤌🏻
I could listen to 3 hours of this
Not the betterhelp eeew
we love you billie
Her voice is so beautiful….Their musicianship flawless - It’s crazy❤. This is my 2nd favorite Tiny Desk to be honest next to Chaka
Omgggggg this is the first time I’ve seen Billie perform I love you I love that song smmm makes me so happy!!!
Unbelievable talent
12/12 booca boocaa booooocaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 💙💛💙
this is the best thing on YouTube
She sounds tired😢
Billie y Finneas son músicos de verdad. Billie canta precioso, parece una veterana con años de carrera. Las canciones son elegantes, sofisticadas, de muy buen gusto, y lucen especialmente en estas versiones minimalistas. Va camino a transformarse en un clásico.
They're just AMAZING!!!!! YES YES YESSSSS LETS GOOOO!!!!
Doechii to Eilish this is EPIC
industry 🪴
I need this on spotify, RIGHT NOW
Cannot get over how amazing she sounds & how much she's improved vocally on an already beautiful voice! She's stunning all the way around guys!!❤❤
Instant Classic. That Sennheiser 418 really brought us in the room with her.  They perform with such intention and restraint to make some art. I wonder how many family members and friends happened to be at work that day.
She's beautiful with a beautiful voice. I'm a fan. Hope she doesn't let the music industry change her.
extremamente apaixonada
I don't fall in love i don't like fallen
i love it gimme 14 of them right now
Was doing great until ily
🔥🔥🔥
She is mesmerizing
can you make Finneas' guitar sound play on both ears pls, it's plays on right ear only and it's a bit unpleasant :( Another than that LOVE THIS SESSION
Bueno día vene mano
Jesse Eisenberg on the drums, nice!
Hat’s down…  Billie is one of my biggest inspiration, we are the same age… and my dream is to meet Billie and give her a hug for what she’s doing for all of us… Love you Billie
You sound.. it's amazing
This version of The Greatest straight chills and so heart felt !!
OMG the description of this videoooo! That's soooo true! Love love loooove from Brazil!!
She is the best Singer of our time. She is an musician. The songs and music are around of her.
YESSS MY QUEEN
Even the slide of the bottle made a beautiful sound, the power she has
Did Bob Boilen just leave all his stuff behind when he retired?
Her songs are so hard to sing live. She doesn't miss
WHO'S CRYIN?????!!!!! MEEE
LA AMO TANTOOO❤ ORGULLOSA ESTOY, BILLIE ES LA MEJOR😭💛
When she finally opens her eyes...wow
Art.
As much as I've loved Billie I honestly didn't think she could get any better but WOW this was AMAZING! Billie this was 🔥 I think Anne Marie would b the only 1 to compete.. GOTTA have Anne Marie on guys!
Mi madre me dio vida pero tiny desk me dio la ganas de vivirla
How is this dressed like a girl. What's dressed like a boy. Still love ya girly
I love you Billie you are my inspiration to sing and you are my singer favorite
beautiful ♡
Here under 1.2 mil views!!!
she’s so powerful and talented, we made the right person famous.
I MUSNT BE INTERRUPTED WHILE LISTENING TO BILLIE
I LOVE YOU BILLIE !!
This was epic
This is what relaxes my ears. Ilysm billie
te amo
She never disappointed us💫
She can’t sing
She's AMAZING!!!! ❤❤❤
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
she’s so powerful and talented, we made the right person famous.
Masterpiece
she’s so powerful and talented, we made the right person famous.
Billie is grown into a beautiful woman
Una joya🤌🏻🤌🏻👏👏👏👏 6:28
THIS IS HEAVEN 😭♥️✨
The amount of ads on this video is crazy and in the middle of songs🙄
1000 times better than the heavily produced music nowadays. Stripped down versions always steal the show. ❤
One of the most talented duo in history it’s crazy to me how they both write and produce the music it’s one thing to sing and have a powerful voice but to write the lyrics and him produce without lots of writers/producers is CRAZY that’s talent wow both so young too!! I love them both so much I hope Billie wins big at the Grammys ❤❤
OMGGGGGGGGGGG IM CRYING
Beautiful performance and fantastic technical work with the audio production.  It sounds fantastic.
plain music as her tshirt.. i gave it a shot tiny desk but it seems this one was all hype
Ayyyy billieeeeeeeeeeeee ❤ tan perfecta 😍
They’ll never write anything prettier than ‘feather’ again
The way I catched myself smiling to the computer. I FREAKING LOVE YOU BILLIEE (and phineas asw)
I NEED THIS ON SPOTIFY RIGHT NOW
Increíble.
Qué bonito canta Verónica Castro 😍🥰
Gra ias por darnos más Billie ♡ es la mejor
Esto Sii ❤❤❤ y no los de la Carol g
i liked before she started singing
aw i was anticipating wildflower but either way this was great gave me chills
😍👏🏻
guys i love love love billie and her music with all of my heart but i dunno if the music she releases truly do her insane raw talent justice.
these sessions needs to become available in spotify
SZA next pleeeeaaasseeee
Greatest artist of our time people, enjoy
Hey Finneas your POS Orangewood guitar sounds like a POS !  Why not just get an Esteban?  Same $hity results.  Really it sounds like a tinny toy guitar.  Very disappointed.  👎👎
The greatest Billie!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA TE AMO BILLIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹😭😭😭😭😭
Oh my
WHAT A VOICE
Lil sis coming through just when i need her 😩💕
Te amo billie, amo lo que hacen. Se me desborda el cuerpo de sentimiento y te agradezco por eso te amo!!!!! Vení a Argentina (No lo va a ver) (soy una boluda)
This performance was amazing! giving me chills from the first note ❤
This performance was amazing! giving me chills from the first note ❤
steady dak bili
oh i love you era coming back
Why was this so short!!!!! She is so incredibly talented
liking the private school uniform aesthetic 👔
SOOO wish I could've been there in person! 🥰🥰 I Iove Billie & Finneas. They're amazing together & individually. ❤❤
The nod of approval at 9:21 by Finn for how she sang that line is so sweet
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Telling her fans to vote for kamala was wack though.
sometimes i feel like she wrote 'the greatest' personally for me i mean i was never able to relate to a song this much!!!
Next DOJA CAT PLS 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Te amo mucho 🖤🥰
Still  no JoJo @TinyDesk
Took long enough.
Thank you for the beautiful performance and thank you for not dressing like Jadakiss in the 2000s
Amazing per usual 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
She’s so cute 😭😭
she’s literally amazing omg
THIS IS AMAZING!!!! BIRDS OF A FEATHER SOUNDS SO DIFFERENT!
I listen to birds of a feather every day. every day. love this song!
Wish u can invite too Nadin Amizah from Indonesia as well
Cute
didnt think i could like The Greatest more but here we are. Full live orchestra NEXT!!!
billie 🤌
i love you billie
We need a Billie x Sufjan Stevens collab
billie in her catholic era
te amo con todo mi corazón billie gracias x existir
Feel like watching this tiny desk on repeat over and over!!
The way Finneas looks at her when she's singing, you can tell he's so proudddd.... UGHHHHH💗
Billie mi patrona 🛐🛐🛐
not singing wildflower should be a crime tbh
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TE AMOMTEMAOMTOEMATMOAETMAOEMOTMTEOMATOMTOAWEETMTOEAMTOEMT TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOO BILLIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YTE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This was literally perfect and felt too short. I wasn't ready for it to end... ever
This will be my new overnight music ❤ thank you bill ❤
Just saw Billie post on her story about this! Had to run over and listen to it, amazing as always.
THE RIFFS
😍😍😍💕💕💕
nunca supe que necesitaría tanto un Tiny Desk de Billie
the i love you note change bro. oh my god
Birds of a feather, cantada en Tiny Desk me hace sentir como si estuviera en el mejor momento de mi vida, donde me alejo de mis problemas y escapo a un lugar mágico. Iloveyou so much Billie
Bro what mic does tiny desk use? The stick looking mic don't look particularly expensive, but they make the artist voice and instruments sound incredible, i wonder if there's any post production tinkering to make everything sound extra sharp..
wow
É impossível descrever exatamente o que é saudade, mas a descrição desse video tentou muito bem.  It's impossible to describe exactly what "saudade" mean, but that video description did a very good job. Congrats, Anamaria Sayre
Should’ve been an hourrr 🥹🫠
not betterhelp……
Skipped through this with the quickness. I tried to find a moment that stood out to me, but it was just subpar. Maybe this just isn't my jam.
I"m not even a Billie fan and I'm gobsmacked. At times she hits a Thom Yorke vibe, but other times it's Jeff Buckley and it's absolutely soul-crushing. If she did an album in this style, I'd buy it on vinyl in a heartbeat.
I hit that like even before i watched it 🤣
So little time for someone that bigger of an artist
Better than Alicia Keyes live on concert finneas is a beast god too
Man I waited so much for this day
Beautiful sound and vocal
Billie’s singing is what I imagine angels sing like
Literally her voice emotes such melancholy, but in the most beautiful way. I tear up every time to her acoustic sets😢
“Hallelujahhhhh”
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Every song sounds the same. 😢
Her eyes, mesmerize ❤
ACOUSTIC ALBUM WEN
tiny desks have become one of my favorite things in 2024
✨🖤✨🖤🥺🥺
Always admire Billie and Finneas relationship.  Finneas is such an important part to Billie’s music and he’s very talented yet never steals the spotlight from her when it comes to her music.
YES
Te amo
Her vocals improved so much wow
Billie is something special. ❤ This absolutely made my day!
❤❤❤
yyyeesss!!! Billie!
Cómo no idolatrarlos?
His voice is like someone running their hands through your hair
Tiny desks often make me enjoy artists I didn't
❤❤❤❤
god i love her
dónde fue la misa?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Idk if I am right or wrong, But, imo, there is no billie without finneas and there's no Fiennes without billie
😻😻😻
Aguante Catriel y Paco !
Thank you for this ❤😍😍😍
What a dream couple praying for full chromosomes
She's the goat of our generation!!!!! xD
We need GAGA, plzzz bring GAGA to Tiny Desk
Her voice and sound is SO incredible. I haven’t been this moved by an artist in a long time.  But why is “birds of a feather” such a hit?? It’s not my fave compared to so many of her other amazing songs.
AD not even halfway through the greatest was WILD
She’s just too good to be that famous, know what I mean?
Sounds so so pretty
Such a superstar. That voice is truly captivating. What a gift.
eu estive aqui.
She has a beautiful voice and I love what was l made for, but a lot her songs seem sad.
tatuaje en el cueio?
been a fan since 2018 and my admiration continues to grow. They are so talented & keep getting better. #1 for a reasonnnn. this was lovely 🥰
Billie feels like this moment when the pill works and you are not in pain anymore
How beautiful it is
The best video description I've ever seen. Greetings from Brazil.
Love her
BILLIE= MIC DROP
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
2nd favorite tiny desk after Mac miller
I love Billie
thats insane, i love her
Has tiny desk on spotify????
Finneas is the busy on tour too in this show 😏
Is it possible to turn off mid roll ads? Seriously infuriating.
I wish my sibling was as supportive of me as Finneas is.
The gasp I gusped when I saw this come up today
Goated
OMFGGGGGGGG
TE AMOOOOOO.😭
l'amour de ma vie is giving Norah Jones
this was very much needed.
I would love to buy this on a cd..
Finneas always looks so proud of Billie when they perform together I love when they perform together
LOVE IT
i need part 2
Meh
Omg omg omg 😭😭😭😭
I gotta give it a dislike for the better help sponsor, sorry guys.
It's been a long time coming Billie
The first and only time I’ve watch Tiny desk was Mac and now Billie.  I’m so grateful to be in this lifetimes with such phenomenal artists like these two.
ok the performances were amazing but i thoroughly expected to see wildflower 😭😭
She sang I Love You omggggggggg
Brilliant. Seriously tragic YouTube Ad butchery, though. Come on, Google, do better.
18:26 Birds Of A Feather
🥹
I LOVE YOUUUUU BILLIR EILISHHHHH !!!!!!!!!
I was waiting for this ❤❤❤❤
That uuh...😂❤❤
Billie deserves album of the year hands down. Pure, raw talent and insane vocal control.   Also does anyone know the lipstick color she could be wearing? I’m obsessed 😍
They never miss!!
best tiny ever.
Baaaaby!!!!! Billie’s mic was ON!!! 😭😭😭
I wish she did chihiro ❤😢
잘하네......
...никакая
quiero y exijo un acústico completo.!!! 22 minutos no son para nada suficiente. se siente tan bien escucharlos🥹🥹🥹💚💚
She's talented but something is off here. She was out of key for the whole of birds of a feather?
"BIRDS OF A FEATHER" is that girl..and this version is beautiful!!!
I love you??? I love you???? We won 😢❤😭 i did not expect that in the setlist
T AMOOOO BILLIEE💚💚
esperaba ansiosamente este vídeo💚💚
goosebumps
1 of paulo londraaaa
It’s just bad. Idk what happened to this chick but it isn’t ideal. Everyone up there looks like they 100% smell like cold wet garbage water.  Strong heroine dry skin greasy hair vibes. She’s 22 ffs she looks like a run down 39 yr old. Take a decade off maybe some back later
She's glowing
Hey you inspired me to do a re-write or mix of BIRDS OF A FEATHER. Verse 1  I want You to stay,  In my life, Yahweh.  Love You every day, love we carry.  You deserve the praise—let's be merry. If you fall, I’m falling too,  But my Lord carries You.  Through the narrow gate,  He’ll guide your way, Sets us free from chains, I pray baby,  Chorus  Birds of a feather,  We can stick together, I know.  You said it better— We can find the treasure at home,  Can change the weather; all is done together, in His  Name forever— It’s even better.  Verse 2  And I know what I’ve been crying for,  Never knew love was so true, Amore.  Was so so wrong, now I’ve seen light, Don’t want to live in blight, Found the love of my life,  And till the day that I fly,  To your arms in the sky, I fly,  Bridge  Baby, let’s go see,  No more daydreaming.  Only life we live, so let’s capture  The moment of the now—this our chapter. Though we’re full of fear,  Loving feels so near.  I can see the truth— Our hearts clean now.  We won’t quit this life,  Won’t be foolish,  Outro  And I know now what I’ve cried so much for.  Love’s love and forgiving, mi amore.  I can’t tell you how much I adore….  ABRUPT FIN.  The rest is up to you  P.s. - His light leads the way,  Every night when I pray to Jesus Christ,  It’s for implicit sanctification and salvation—OK? I knew You too, in another life - reciprocated,  I recognise that same spark in Your eyes, I rate it,  I love You too… So, surprise, we made it…! Heaven’s knocking at the door :)
DI O SAS MARA VI LLO SAS🌟
Is the drummer holding a pack of spaghetti?
🥺💙🙌🏿
Great job my friends!
Mixing masterclass from the team as usual
Exactly what I opened the YouTube app for. First video to show up on my feed🙏🏻
Thank You Billie, for the early Christmas gift!!
billie elish never fails to not only give me full body chills, but make tears stream down my face
I love you Billie 🩵💚
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏽
Ohhh myyyy Billie has such beautifullllll vocalsss her vibrato and pronunciation is on pointtttt and finneas does an amazing jobbb AND THE BAND gotta give them credit!!! She’s incredible!😊
Tiny desk is the good part of listening to music in the 2020's
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Love it 😍❤️‍🩹
these brothers are everything that's good in music
They are the cutest
I never heard Billie Eilish before, but I guess this is a great start tho! 🤭
LOVE YOU
I get goosebumps. She's so good, Finneas, the band, the songs.. Everything is just right. You guys could come back to Argentina 😉
GOAT
I love her so much OMG your voice is so GOODDDDD
this means so much to me.
shes hotttttttttttttttttt
Having mainstream artists on tiny desk is so worth it. Now we can see the artists vocal skills clearly and not behind the luxury productions used. Billie Eillish delivered she surpassed my expectations 😮❤ I love her recent album hit me hard and soft and I’ve streamed it a lot on Spotify hopefully she wins a Grammy for it, it’s well deserved. And I hope more current mainstream artists appear like Kendrick Lamar, Sabrina Carpenter, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd etc
Dios bendice este día con este bello regalo
doechii, the marias and billie all within 2 months?? this is insane
Perfecta ❤
songs by the time:  0:22 - the greatest  6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:57 - I love you  18:27 - birds of a feather   I love her 💐💙
:)
whoever put the ads in the middle of the songs deserves prison
try to watch this without crying challenge
🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
I didn't know I needed this tiny desk until billie and finnieas came up
Thanks for this show. Billie is not from my generation but I like so much her songs and her beautiful voice. All songs has a bunch of fellings and the way she sings is amazing.
Whaattt
always happy when I hear this voice
alguien sabe en que parte esta la bota del Kevin?
YES Billieeeee <3 AMAZING performance.
Am so glad to watch these two together performing!
i need this on apple music
Literally chills 16:01
Team ferb
Bravo!!!!!
SEM WILDFLOWER? 😢😢😢
Do, do you hear this?
Another great show ⭐ very nice  *🌛  A Beautiful 🧸 😴 💤  mello set... ❤
just perfect
💚🕷
perfect
love this for us
must be 10+ years of tiny desk concerts for me, and they're still my favorite uploads on YouTube. NPR doing the lords work
She’s a genius. I can’t get enough of her
I love this woman, soooooo talented, she makes me happy
que hermosooo!!
Its amazing how this place changes when a mainstream artist performs. Ominous.  Leaving that aside, I for one am so pleased to have finally experienced some of her artistry.  Being counterculture I've avoided her. But she gave us some very special gifts here ☮🐉👁
I love you Billie.
woke
This will go down as one of the greatest Tiny Desk performances of all-time.
The way Billie & Finneas harmonize is heavenly.
I was waiting for this tiny desk <3
Edith Piaf wistfulness
qq custa voltar pro brasil
The way Finneas adoringly watches his sister while she sings is so lovely. They are such a special duo, so in sync.
"been wanting to do this my whole life" when she did the same back in 2020. 😃😃
wonderful!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Enough with the singing lets see some dinner plates
nice music moist critical
Finally😭
Better Help??? How much do they pay people to sponsor them?? Must be a big pay check considering they scam lots of people in need.. more like NO help.. so annoying.. can we actually sponsor a good company?
PERFECTION
Did Billie like Portland? 🥺 she just performed there on Sunday but hasn’t posted anything. Should we have done better?
❤wow I love it
Please stop endorsing Betterhelp, I don’t want to stop watching Tiny Desk concerts. NPR, this is not certified therapy nor are their “therapists” professional. The platform doesn’t take responsability for the services they provide
Very good! <3
💙💙💙 album of the year
Finally
Please stop endorsing Betterhelp, I don’t want to stop watching Tiny Desk concerts. NPR, this is not certified therapy nor are their “therapists” professional. The platform doesn’t take responsability for the services they provide
Can we bring amine back also
Can we bring back Larry June ? This was nice though
Talent runs in their family.  Both have beautiful voices, they tell stories in the songs they write.  Beautiful.
Love what you guys do. Thank you for putting great music ❤
This made my day
I don't think there is any artist that I connect with more, Billie is the most talented person I have ever seen, her voice is able to calm me in my worst moments and I loved this concert with all my soul.
STOP PUTTING ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF SONGS!!!!!!
i love you.
It's not that she has a bad voice but maybe actually try to sing so we can hear it? Just a thought..
Thank you!!!! 😊
This is so beautiful omg
And this is why Billie is my favourite female Artist!
Billie ❤
It must be really hard to clean those shelves.
Billie looks like she just got off work at Applebees, with that chef coat on
O finneas estragando the greatest
Need this to release on vinyl
diossssss 💖
The greatest y I love you siempre me hacen llorar
Quien 2022?
Please stop taking BetterHelp money. They are a company who misuses client's personal health information on top of scamming people with often unlicensed providers who have no ethical concern for their clients. I can't tell you how many horror stories I have heard.
Sobrevalorada zzzzzzzzz
Essa é minha artista ❤
This should have 8 hours
She reminds me of Ellie (TLOU)
❤❤❤
Agora sei a referência da Luiza Sonza! Top!! Parabéns!! Brasil 🇧🇷
It’s like a mantra! 🕉️ 🧘🏽‍♂️✨
Besides him being the production head, he shouldn't be part of her music.
Jeeez❤
Omg i love youu😭😻
Not a fan of this super-duo’s music, but there’s no denying their absolutely monumental, world-class talent. Holy smokes.
I LOVE YOU will always hit different I swear 🥺
The amount of vocal control to do what she does is absolutely insane. Billie has a unique way of expressing emotion through her music and THAT inspires me. She will know me soon. I'm an Indian kid who raps very well.
I am grateful that Billie is so young, started so young, has such great support and such a great family, and we'll get to watch and hear her grow and evolve and create for many many more years. What a priveledge.
Billie Eilish is so beautiful and talented. I watched her perform live at Coachella in April 2022. She’s wonderful. 🎤🎶💕
Yikes better help
Thank you for creating such beautiful music. I hope those scratches are healed already.
This sounds phenomenal
The I love you part had me in tears
The greatest brings me to tears. Billie and Finneas are geniuses
I love you is so beautiful. So raw. Tears.
Why the advertisements for private companies at the beginning of your videos lately? I thought this was from National Public Radio.
half of these views are from me
I could watch this for ever
She apologized to the technician who adjusted her mic because she didn't want to be an inconvenience. World's biggest superstar and still humble. This girl is just amazing
No puedo escuchar este tiny con las hormonas como las tengo, no paro de llorar
This was truly so special, so pure and so healing. I have no words to describe how Billie makes me feel, I hold her and Finneas close to my heart.
listening to this while clearing my phone storage.  The events and people that have run their course, maybe next time.
I crying, Billie are so perfect and she never dissapoint, you are amazing Billie! and thank you Tiny Desks for having brought her 🩵
1m in 8 hours crazy!
Billie is so beautiful
Man she's gained some weight
Pleaseee bring back Liniker again with her new album Caju. It's just perfecft!
im so happy she performed l'amour de ma vie!!
She is so beautiful and has such an amazing voice!!!!
Si sigue creciendo musicalmente va a dominar el mundo mi ciela
Te amo billie
Voy entrando y ya llore
I love this tiny desk session, but WILDFLOWER was missing. 🥲
Finneas in bird of a feather thooooo he ate that up
Cómo vas a cantar así por dios 🔥
Hermoso❤❤❤❤❤
I could listen to them whole day…Those voices are heavenly ❤
Billie is genuinely one of the most talented artists to have risen up in the last few years, the composition on the songs are insane. Finneas is also an amazing musician
Eu sou o único que estava esperando ela cantar WILDFLOWER ?????  Minha música favorita do novo álbum, que raiva. (Billie com uma qualidade vocal surreal como sempre)
THIS WAS SO BASIC MY GOD.
I was not trying to appreciate “Birds of a feather” when the song came out,Lately I can’t stop listening to the melody and songwriting.😫
Ela é mt linda
Wait what?
Pqp! Bom demaissss
15:43 fineneas making sure Billie is okay😭
Que chimba ver una bandera de Colombia en ese set. Billie you’re an absolute legend.
eyy
THANK YOU SANTA
Whats with suddenly putting the ads in the middle of the songs?
I’m on the bandwagon now. She’s good!
❤
Will be winning Album of The Year.
peak of music
soft, delicate, sweeet <3
Birds of a feather is so satisfying❤
9:26 holy f that was beautiful (But so was everything else also lawl)
What lovely way to sing this song 🎵
I'd watch 10 hours straight of this masterpiece
No puedo verlo, a alguien más le pasa?
i love the way finneas looks at billie when she sings. he's always been there for billie to love and support her through everything. it makes me overjoyed.
BUM BUM BUMMMM
MI AMOR TE MAO TE AMO TE AMO TE AMO TE AMO ET AMO TE AMO
Great performance, this will be one of the great and most viewed NPR Tiny Desks I can feel it!
Wow really only one POC in her band AND they play the bass 🙄🙄
Wow what a voice 🫡 👏
Gosh I hope they release this and Chappell's sets on vinyl. Magical stripped back live versions, wow
God. What a lovely.
This is why she was my top listened to artist and album this year. Just pure raw beautiful talent between the both of them. Their songs are just so peaceful sometimes haunting and even heartbreaking but you cant stop listening to that voice and those melodies. They fit together so perfectly thank you to their parents for making them!
I love Billie so much omg!!❤
a Billie arrasa até na fase de irmã da igreja
been waiting for this one! <3
Just meh - not inspiring
I had no idea she was this good!
♥
She's so perfect. Her voice is clear, light and pure. Everytime when i listen your songs, i get goosebumps
The greatest é minha preferida!
Precioso!!!
💜 that is all.
I love u til the day there i die Billie
The Greatest.
La voz de ella me transmite tanta paz, i lov her 🥲
I just experienced Billie Eilish in her Atlanta concert, it was absolutely amazing. One of the best concerts I have ever been to.
So good to hear the purest music form of such talent…dare I compare the harmonies to The Civil Wars of years ago …oh how I miss them !
the rawest tiny desk ive seen. no funky clothing, no coolio attitude, nothing unnecessary. just pure music going straight into your heart. wow
Oooohh I really like how much fuller Birds Of A Feather is here!
MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED 👏👏👏❤❤
That’s the loudest I’ve ever heard the crowd cheer on Tiny Desk for an artist. 👏👏👏
i actually needed this to be 15 hours long, 22 minutes too short
Ariana Grande needs to be here!
I adore how Finneas looks at her when she sings - he respects and loves her so much, it’s obvious. And Billie does the same. It is a joy to witness the creativity and talent of these two. ❤
LINDA❤❤❤❤
Well, I guess Taylor is calling her agent
Que voz tan hermosa, te amo Billie❤
I'm 53 and worked all day with geriatric patients. This was the first thing on my page! Who knew Billieeilish could help fix parts of me just by the sharing of musical emotion?
Valeu NPR, to aqui pensando quanto eu pagaria para assistir isso e vocês dispobilizando de graça ❤
It's really lovely to hear Billie and Finneas in their natural state, stripped down and without the meticulous production and frills
wasn't better help exposed as a scam? lol
This was mid
im so glad my mother texted me this 😭🙏
I love Billie Eilish 🙌🏼
This sounds is magic, just beautiful! Literally move you to another place. Thanks Tiny Desk, and thanks Billie Eilish for your great music 👌🏻❤️
Mortaaaaaaa Perfeitaaaaaaa ❤❤❤
YESSSSS❤❤❤❤
Ok, WHOT? Really needed it
Her voice gives me goosebumps this is such a fabulous tiny desk!
Thank you for this gift ❤
BILLIEEEEE
You are amazing❤so young and talented🤩🎵 it’s so good to listen performing far from the crowds🥰  ❤️tinydesk concerts
OMG😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤
zzzzzzzzzz
‘i love you’ billie you are the ‘lamour de ma vie’ and truly ‘the greatest’ and i hope we can be ‘birds of a feather’ forever!
love u :)
i don't care about Billie, but i can recognize her importance in music. but after i realized that fans can't attend tiny desks it all lost 80% of the magical element to me...
She’s so beautiful, her voice is so beautiful, and she had me crying while eating McDonald’s. I love her so much and she never deserves any hate ever.
THE ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF SONGS IS NUTSO!!! I have commented this a few times.... This is a stripped-down, music program. Cutting off songs for ads is literally insane.
almost instant tears, her voice, her words, they take over me like a wave of realization
Billie.. you ready to throw on a luchador mask and go do underground music with Ren and/or Chinchilla?
This epic performance made me remember why i started  following  Billie and Finneas all those years ago.  😔❤️
Finneas and Billie togheter are great! Perfect match!
Big love and thanks to tiny desk concert🫶 I can feel closeness to the artists everytime more than any other big concert! ビリー、可愛い🥰You also have an amazing quality of voice and a ability to express emotions… I love her relaxed atmosphere. Thanks message from Japan x
Me dormi
which guitar does finneas use for "i love you"?
Just in love with this version of The Greatest
the way finneas looks at her with such love and admiration ♥️♥️ their sibling relationship is so beautiful
me faltó el  mew mew mew mew 🎵😽
AHAHAHAHHAHA SHES SO HOT
oh my gosh
It's been a long time coming! Go, Billie and Finneas!
I may be late to the party, but I never knew Billie Eilish had such a lovely singing voice...❤
Nice concert, but I wish she screamed during The Greatest and Birds of a Feather 😢
Man, she is The Greatest ❤‍🔥
👍
The most perfect tiny desk ever!!! This is the bar now!
HUHHHH???? WHAAAAT???? KHEEEEEE!?!??!?!
Absolutely gorgeous
Vine tan rápido como pude 🥹
WHAT A GIFT!
La amo ❤
She looks like Korean
OMGGGG YESSSSSSSSS❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
I HAVE BEEN WAITINGGGGG
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Raw talent
So talented <3
timestamps 0:22 - the greatest 6:43 - l'amour de ma vie 11:52 - I love you 18:27 - birds of a feather
Putting an ad right in the middle of I love you is CRIMINAL
i was watching doechiis tiny desk and i was thinking ab Billie in here...wow
My Christmas present came early!!!❤❤❤❤
mature songs - thanks👏

the way that Finneas stares at her 🥺🥺
"but you were not mine" 🤭
a risadinha no verso quem sabe sabe ❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹
Funny this is All of these songs sounded the same!  Like tweaked covers of songs from Amy Winehouse “Frank”.  Very Unoriginal!  Typical whiny caucus indie sad girl pop.
GOATS
como tiene esa voz
she’s so beautiful and talented..not to mention finneas who can sing and play. he deserves more credit
OMGGG!! I’m lovin’ it with every layer of my skin 😍😍😍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 YOU SAVED ME THIS YEAR ❤️‍🩹
OMG.
Crazy that I’ve got to see talented Billie last week in Vancouver, watching this feels even more special now
One of the best voices/talents of not only this generation, but many others. Finneas is the real deal too.
Can’t even articulate how talented she is!
"I knew you in another life You had that same look in your eyes I love you, don't act so surprised"  Reciprocated for real IJN
Billie playing i love you, my literal favorite song of hers mkes me SO HAPPY
If flowers could sing❤❤❤❤❤
she is so surreal 🤍
Se va al recontra síguiripeehhhh
Genia billie ❤
PERFECTION OMG
❤❤❤❤❤
I’m so early thank goodness 😭😭
she was too scared to dress the way she usually does in front of her bassist
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TODAY, THANK YOU OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUUUUUCH AAAAAAAA
Watching after seeing her in San Jose on 12/11/24. Still on a high from the show and now blessed with this🥹💜
please please please put this on steaming !!
I love tiny desk and I love billie😭, never been happier in my life❤
classic example of a great singer held back by broad pop music.
In the clurb we all cry
I'm simple I see Billie I click
❤❤❤❤❤❤
i love you is also one of my favorite Billie songs of all time. so so so happy to hear it played here where ppl will actually be irreverent and let the song breathe the way it deserves!! that person saynig "wow" right at the end is me lol the tears started right along with "didn't mean to make you cry" and never stopped. that HIGH note, goosebumps.
That was so beautiful
One of the most beautiful tiny desks I’ve ever seen. Hearing I love You in 2024 made me tear up ngl. Billie’s voice was so good too, and the songs she chose were great❤️
No tiny desk is better than ca7riel y Paco amoroso  ! They are insane ❤🔥🔥🔥
This is talent lol
billie is so pretty and talented
fireeee
I WENT TO ALL UR CONCERTS!
obsessed with the caption of this video. it’s so sweet.
The way that she starts L’Amour de ma vie is so smooth, so exquisite for my ears🤩. The arrangements were magnificent and all the musicians were amazing. Billie and Finneas 💯💯💯
Not the better help ad… I thought you were better tiny desk.
for when CHIHIRO live?
Only song I knew of Billie’s was ocean eyes. Thanks Tiny Desk. She’s pretty good.
Hitting me with I Love You was unsolicited violence… and I loved it 😭😭
Exactly whose desk is that?
the way i started sobbing when i recognized the guitar from "i love you"
What a big treat! Thank you Blilie, Finneas, and NPR
THIS is the Best birthday with your vídeo❤️
Please bring Adele again, please
Her voice is angelic
yet again another perfect performance.
THE NOTE CHANGE IN 'I LOVE YOU' FROM TOUR IS HEREEEEE
I know nothing about Billie Eillish, I dont have one single song of hers in my playlists but I love her. Once every blue moon she pops up on my feed and I always listen. Amazing artist.
I’m so happy she’s back on and on the set this time :)))))))
4:58 sounds like Laufey!
God came down and said:
Just so beautiful ❤ the singing and the person
I had to pause to process the first song. Unbelievable talent and spirit.
Wow ❤
Wow 🙏🏻
THANKS TINY DESK FOR OFFICIAL CHORDS
she went from so exciting to so boring in just 3 albums
15:57 😥
I wish she put more into this recording of the greatest
Me: *listening to the sweet, sultry sounds of Billie Eilish and crew* YT: HEY HOW ABOUT A LOUD AF AD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The world just stopped js for me to watch this show no matter what I had to do- it can wait
I LOVE YOU BILLIE MONA😍😘
🤭🤭
This is good but it's kind of impossible to follow Doechii.
❤❤ what a lovely performance
love u billie❤
I want the belts, I NEED the beltssss
here before it hits 1mil views
A piece of art😮‍💨👌🏼
Fing YouTube inserts an ad in the middle  the first song.
Amazing!!😍
Meu Deus!!! Era disso que eu precisava pra fechar 2024 com chave de ouro hahahha ✨😭💙
I have never heard such a loud applause  sounds like a lot of people squeezed  in there. ❤
Second most boring desk around, mine's first.
It's insane how an artist (I mean Billie and finneas both) who is so insanely famous, popular and commercially successful for many years now manages to deliver such a real and raw tiny desk. This is legit! It reminds me of the tiny desks from like 10 years ago
🥳👏😍
LOST FOR WORDS!!!!
Their eyes while they do what they love are so deep and beautiful ❤ I love these two, best siblings
Embrace tradition, meaning volvamos a la guitarrita y paremos un poquito con los soniditos digitales que ya me tienen hasta las pelotas.
bullie and finneas singing together 🥹
Te amo Billie,  gracias por el album ❤
❤❤❤
What is MTV?
Gurl I needed more
I LOVE YOU IS HER BEST SONG
YASSS!!! she finally made it to tiny desk!!
Oh wow, what an Intro! Bestie. . . ;) love ya and some of your hate vibe, that I love so much!!! Peace
betterhelp is a joke.
whtas crazy is.... there is more pressure for the band to perform rn than Bilie
I've seen Billie live twice, but this is the setting I crave for
voice of an angel
PORAAAAAAAAAAA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ explodindo
I haven’t even watched this and I know it’s gonna be SICK.
OMG her voice is so f amazing  We are lucky to have her in our times🥹🩵
I want an album with both their voices NOW
She sang it so heavenly
next NRP with the weeknd
Christmas came early! Thank you Tiny Desk for making so many peoiple happy.
Grossartig!
Billie is iNSANEEE

😭❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 gracias vida
Meow meows meow meows
Donating plasma and just experiencing chills/ hiding tears lol
the most beautiful voice❤ Billie love you
YOU NEED CONAN GRAY NOW 🙏🙏🙏
SHE FINALLY GOT IT TO DO IT IN THE ACTUAL PLACE 😭💔 Billie makes me be in mental places i love so ty Tiny Desk for this
Such a singer
Hi. I would love to see Ariana on this!
QUE MUJERRRR QUE SOS BILLIE LPM
I love her
I need one from Humbe RN ❤️❤️
11:51😢
She new not to put on that durag
Tão Linda e talentosa! Te amo Bills!
Why is she performing with Julian Assange?
Not a fan but she really has voice of an angel. What a talent
Oh doechii eats this flop
❤❤❤❤❤i just can say wow
faltaron 🎻
hermosaaaaaaaaa
Billie, I love you! ♥
I looooove billie down and I listen to this album daily but I honestly just miss having "commercially" successful singers that their vocals match the studio version as the live version just like Beyonce...doesn't mean billie is not talented she's really good but I guess artists like Beyonce will never exist anymore
🎉🎉🎉
Before she said she was going to sing “i love you” I said “please sing it please sing it please sing it” 😭😭😭
She has an amazing voice
el outfit más tranqui de Billie:
My ears are blessed
Call the patrol she's gone blue
So blessed to watch this the day it came out.
Great! I love It ❤❤❤❤
Omgggggggg how did my algorithm just show me this?
wow
She’s too good 😭😭
Anyone else love the deeply somber expression on that guy's face in the background at 12:38 ?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ magic.
So good.
I WANT MORE! I LOVE BILLIE AND FINNEAS SO MUCH AND THEY DID SO GOOD! AND THEY SANG I LOVE YOU?!❤️❤
need this version of the greatest on all streaming platforms stat… so beautiful
Why did you chose these microphones
Love her voice so much! Fragile precise and wonderful texture!!! Amo Billie!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
fiya
Apart from the impressive singing she looks so gorgeous here. She doesn't resemble the teenager I grew up listening anymore. She has more adult features now
i love this woman.
THE WORLD IS ✨ HEALING ✨
I feel like doing this is the equivalent of dancing in front of people so ong I bet they’re shitting themselves lol. I would be 😅
❤❤❤
Love a tiny desk!
😍❤️🥰
i don't listen to a lot of Billie Eilish more so because I believe it gets played A LOT on the radio which isn't a bad thing but with so many songs, I can only listen to them a few times before I crave something different...but this...I could listen to for hours on end
00:00 - THE GREATEST 6:42 - L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:52 - i love you 18:26 - BIRDS OF A FEATHER
YIPPEEEEE
Spotify please
She is the most gorgeous singer.
I love how fineas kept looking at her, especially during I love you. He knows it was a hard song for her. I love fineas for that.❤
splash
I wish KPOP had stuff like this, all of kpops shows like this are all auto tuned/pitch corrected, never any real vocals.
SHE'S FINALLY ON TINY DESK!!!!!😩😩❤️
just what we needed
Chills every time
Finally, a proper Billie and Finneas tiny desk. None of that covid shhhhhh
It was l'amour de ma vie for me❤
16:08 BILLIE?
Yuss Jessica slay
Ahh não tava esperando por isso! BILLIE!!!! ARRASA MY BABY ❤
Hm, Billie Eilish is the best guy 🤤
Tiny desk just doesn’t miss at all, good stuff!
Exquisite ❤❤❤❤❤
Immediate chills dude!
Billie eilish era mi crush en mi adolencensia tercermundista 🥹😓🦊Alguien digale que me Siga esperando Que Un dia Nos Conoceremos ///Billie Eilish was my crush in my third world adolescence 🥹😓🦊Someone tell her to keep waiting for me that one day we will meet ( FUERA DE JODA QUE HERMOSA SU VOZ SU MUSICA, SU ÁRTE Y TODO SU SER💙🦋.   A octubre del 2025, veo que mi emocion fue demasiada y por eso exagere en mi sentimiento, discrepo ahora en la forma que lo dije pero sí, lo demas es absolutamente correcto un día conocere a Billie y a muchisimos artistas más que admiro tanto ❤❤❤ att: BEN.
She kinda got that Nora Jones vibe.
I went to her concert on the 8th of December. It was amazing. I LOVE YOU BILLIE!
And just like that my day is made ❤
I love how she looks dressed for a piano recital it's so baby 🥺
Phineas and Ferb are impressive artists !
Ufff gross
I hope your sponsor paid you a trillion dollars for ruining the re-playability of this video TDC usually get played millions of time because you can put them in playlists and listen. The intro ruins it. Big yikes.
Absolutely stunning. Thank you.
Better help ads. Come on.
OMG, it is Christmas! I got my Billie Converse shoes today and now this! This is sooo good, only Billie can make you feel so emotional even if you are happy and vice versa! Love her and Finneas!
I picked up her isolated vocals album on RSD, It's amazing to hear just her voice with hardly any music.
linda
Why do the tiny desk shows always make me so emotional lol
She sounds great.
This was utterly divine. So wonderful to hear her voice in this simple live setting. It's so pure and heavenly. She doesn't fit any genre, but sometimes makes me think of some of the older torch singers. And finneas of course is brilliant as ever also
0:22 The Greatest 6:43 L'Amour De Ma Vie 11:50 I love you 18:25 Birds Of A Feather
Her voice is perfection.
Que hermosa
22 minutos de pura felicidad ,gracias Billie por todo este año sin dudas formaste gran parte de mi vida y saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷
YESSSS
Her voice is velvet ❤ how could anyone not be entranced by her singing!?
Chorando
te amo billie
Song name?
Her voice is incredible 😊
A modern Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova minus the romantic relationship
Awesome. Loved it! 12/12/24
in tears
Anyone else hear shades of Billie Holiday, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell and many others in her delivery?  The kid can sing.  Old enough to be her grandfather and I find her music fascinating.  Great show.
Tbh don’t think I was mentally prepared for I love you
Billie Eilish canta como una Angel princess más guapa del mundo así o más gorgeous y much beautiful con Smile esos eyes esa cara y mirada quien no la va querer yo si I Love so much you Biliie. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
11:52 i love you dni :(
doing NPR performance amidst touring? oh she's MOTHER for that
Beautyful, could enjoy this longer
Thank you NPR Music!
why do I like this version of the greatest more than the og? Like- don't get me wrong, the original is great too, but I really like this one.
Can't really put into words what exactly it is about the stuff her and her bro make but it is beautiful!
Billie’s and Finneas’  vocals match so well together
Christmas came early!!!
She brings I love you back, made my heart scream out
I’m listening and I can feel the emotions of the songs. So intense yet so gentle.
This is so breathtakingly beautiful <3
Billie Eilish: this is nerve-racking for me. Also Billie Eilish: *sings Billie Eilish*
I know it gets praised for each tiny desk, but the sound design on this is incredible. Finneas as well man
⭐
I was here
THE NOTE CHANGE THE NOTE CHANGE THE NOTE CHANGE THE NOTE CHANGE THE NOTE CHANGE
Te amo wna
did I start crying in the library because of this, yes yes I did
THE CROWD IN THIS ONE SAYS EVERYTHING ❤❤❤❤
💕
YES BABY
Woah shes so stunning and billie your music is sooo gooooood 🥹🥰
We really made the right person famous , she really is a the GREATEST! I’ve been a fan since ocean eyes! And I Will never get tired of hearing her angelic voice! We are SUPER LUCKY to have her!✨  ‘I love you’ really hit me hard , that song will always make shed a tear!
Thank you for dropping this on my birthday 😭🙏🙏💓
This person is not real. She is otherworldly! One of the most amazing vocalists maybe ever. 🩷
the CHILLS i got when she played i love you
OMG SHE GOT A TINY DEST CONCERT YAYYYY
Definitely the "pop" singer i respect the most, and the sibling duo is super cool. Such raw talent and emotionality in their work.
im living for billie's tiny desk performances
This genuinely might be top 3 Tiny Desk's of all time. Billie Eilish and Finneas are generational talents.
12:05 esa no 😭
YESSSS FINALLY!!!!
She sang  I love you 😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you for blessing my ears Billie ❤
We need to see twenty one pilots in this setting!!
❤🤧😭🥹I LOVE YOU BILLY EILISH SOU BEATIFUL!! 18/18
The thing i love about her is her music seems so underground when you listen to it because of how special the feelings they capture are, you totally forget how her music isnt only to you and the whole entire globe has this special connection with her through her music.
Spoil it for me. Does she sing Ocean Eyes?
Thanks❤
Let’s go Billie!!❤
I was expecting that phone on the desk to ring.
her vocal control is INSANE
i loveeeee
What a load of BS. One of the worst ooooooioiioiooooooooo.
Tiny Desk Unplugged 🔌
😻😻😻😻
Billie owns 2024
TATUAJE EN EL CUEIIOOOO????
Billie Eilish is one of the few artists that is always offering something new and evolving all the time. Never get bored listening her.  Thank you Tiny Desk!
It's like her voice floats. ❤
es como estar en el cielo, se los jurooo
There was no bald man :c
somzera, muito bom.
la voz de billie es angelical
when we fall asleep will forever be my favorite ❤️‍🩹
빌리아이리시또나왔네
She's so beautiful inside and out. Watched for 10 seconds and cried <3
Man why would anyone pay money to go watch a show that makes you depressed. The whole thing is sad and depressed. I need meds now
TATUAJE EN EL CUEIOOOO?!?!?!!
that "wow" after i love you is so real
My ears are blessed
She’s amazing live and normally her live performances sound exactly like the studio recordings but birds of a feather is the first time where you can tell it was too hard to do live. Very different from the studio vocals.
Of course she didn’t wear that biggie clothes around black people
Amor eterno para Billie <3
no auto-tune, non of that BS, just pure raw talent
beautiful omg queen
My favorites songs ever 😢
I love billie eilish I am the first person in the world to listen to her He is seriously an idol that I have looked up to since my childhood. and someone who makes me feel like he is with me every moment of my life, thank you 🥲❤️‍🩹✨️
Is this real life?
My cat fell asleep while she sang “I love you”.. crying in the club

Android I don’t appriciate youre AI AD in the middle of Billie singing her  heart out 😫🫠
When I love you came in I uncontrollably started crying, it’s like my Super Bowl. 💗
I love uuuu
Just so incredible.
6:42      L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:52    i love you 18:20    BIRDS OF A FEATHER
YES YES YES
no wildflower is CRAZY
we’ve been waiting for this
I love i love you😢😩
I think she is the only artist that I would pay an arm just to hear her sing in person, no mic, no nothing, just hear her have fun and sing. People don't know how lucky they are to have that experience. Amazing as always both of them and the band
The way Finneas  looks at her😭
Wow❤❤
OMH
9:36 🕊️😇🫠
We need a wildflower redemption
Billie and Finneas are pure musical genius. ❤
TIMESTAMPS  0:00 the greatest  6:44 l’amour de ma vie  11:53 i love you  17:49 (introducing the band :D) 18:28 birds of a feather
OMG ILY BILLIE
Cadê os fãs brasileiros?🇧🇷 Que lindaa amei ela e  o Finneas cantando juntos❤
Obsessed
... but you were not miiine
BILLIEEE! Did you delete Drakes number yet?
Those last Tiny Desk videos are gut wrenchingly beautiful...  💖😭🇭🇹
OMG needed this
Her music is truly beautiful, her voice, the lyrics. All of it . Really good feelings listening to her perform , always! Inspiring for sure
not the betterhelp sponsorship
Great tiny desk. However, i feel like Im yet to see a truly good performance of Birds of a Feather
This was so beautiful. 🎸💕
Her voice is always so soft and beautiful
ughhh the live vocalsssssss
i love how finneas admires billie; the way he looks at her like shes the most beautiful girl hes seen {not in a weird way}
Tiny Desk realized money is better than giving small artists exposure
her vocals are still unreal to me. major props to finneas as well.
she played i love you oh my lord no one talk to me
Ughhhhhhhh I needed this today fr
get in boys we’re heading to big sad
need to see tate mcrae on here she does incredible acoustic versions of her songs
Love the music. BetterHelp sponsorship at the start of the video sucks. It’s well documented that BetterHelp sells sensitive user data.
que grande billie y macaulay juntos feliz navidad
The God I hate it line always got me
WE ARE FEDDDD
This is the closest I'll get to a Billie Eilish concert 😢😢😢
Thank God this exist
This is freaking amazing. Biggest inspiration to my own music. I see you Billie ❤
NPR is garbage and so is betterhelp.
❤ I absolutely adore this young lady. Her voice is beautiful.
a veces me olvido q billie era tan chikita cuando todo empezo, la kiero muxo
nadie me mueve de aquí
I LOVE TINY DESKKKKK❤❤
her voice is so healing
Obsessed!!!!!❤
this is amazingly beautiful
They are so amazing
7:09 my brain went "wait is that laufey?" lol
❤❤❤
she’s so amazing
❤
When she said 'an old one' I thought Ocean Eyes or something... time is something
Can we please get this the greatest as a release? My fave Billie performance yet!! 🥲
Tiny Desk brings us closer to the way the song was originally conceived, without excessive production or  "noise".
“Dressed like a girl” I had zoomed in to see the detail on her shirt. 😂
WHY NO WILDFLOWER
Cinta banget sama Billie😢❤❤
Beautiful. There are no words.
WHO DAT IN THE FRONTTTTT 😍😍😍😍
so grateful to NPR Music and the musicians for giving us a unique version to songs we already know & love <3
AHHH I LOVE TINY DESK AND BILLIE, THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVERRR🗣️🗣️🗣️
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
her and finneas’s talent is seriously so underrated. she sounds just like the recording. love her.
i didnt knew i needed this until i watched
So...this version of The Greatest on Spotify when?
Bravo. The sound is excellent and the talent is undeniable
I absolutely loved this and love Billie but I could see how nervous she was and just wanted to hug her the whole time!🥺
So beautiful 🥹😊
Que muggger 🙌✨
NPR please not betterhelp - they are seriously shady
❤❤❤❤
This healed me:)❤
Anyone else notice the hot Cheeto fingers ❤
Whack! Her voice isn’t that good
Shout out to the sound engineer
Please allow longer sets and make it available for streaming (maybe even physical copies). This could be the new MTV Unplugged!
man am i the greatesssss...t *goosebumps
miel para mis oidos <3
I'm SO happy that they performed I love you, it's my favorite song from Billie, it was beautiful
Why her voice was so low here ? 😭😭😭😭 Maybe she its tired of the tour ❤
Everyone shilling for the better help charlatans these days.
Did you just stab me?
❤
Whos here in 2025
SHE ATE THAT UPPPP
Did they choose the musicians for their luscious hair
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
sign to listen to billie???
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Smart idea of not wearing that god awful hat backwards 😂
Oh my word! ❤❤❤❤
Billie and Finneas are beautiful and so talented and it's so lovely to see them come so far together. Finneas deserves his own, his solo music is amazing!
I was hoping Finneas would be in this tiny desk too, as much as I love Billie I really love Finneas's solo music and I hope he can also have his tiny desk concert sometime in 2025. Very refreshing to hear Billie's new music in this medium and listening to her sound transform with every release <3
Gorgeous. ♡
ti amo
I'm only halfway through the first song and can already tell this will be right up there with Mac Miller's Tiny Desk performance.  Edit: I was right. That was 22 minutes well spent.
haceme tuya billie eilish
Honestly the best decision she’s ever made it’s to bring more people for example her friends for the acoustic rendition of Wildflower and now here with the band and Finneas. Honestly I’m excited for the future of music with these two.
Loved it! 😍so soft and so beautiful.
Lovely melodies . Ooooooo ✨✨✨✨✨✨❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"L'AMOUR DE MA VIE"💙
this deserves to be released as its own live ep because OH MY god is every single song so beautiful
Oh hey before 1 million
her voice is so beautiful and raw
I feel one Of the greatest challenges that we first timers face in the ma rket is that we end up losing all we have, we find it difficult to find ourselves back to our feet. Big thanks to Jasmine Querida. I now make huge profits  through her services while still learning to stand on my own
tiny desks are the new mtv unplugged
Tiny desk, giant feelings.
I miss old tiny desk with No commercial artists
Yay 🎉
i love everything about her couldn’t be more proud of anyone else
Mo paz <3
Aura de bonheur, beauté, avec une vibrante voix sincere et hypnotique ! Soutenue par un band impeccable ! Merci et bravo !  Québec
❤
Did Amberlynn Reid manifest this
the person saying "wow" at 16:50, girl me too
jacob collier fake oyster ID top shelf to the right next to Finneas
how could you not like her?
te qUIero mucho Billie
Did BOAF go number 1 or is she lying?
My God….this voice is out of this world ❤
need this on streaming right now
I just like her so much as a person! On top of her fantastic voice. 😊
First song is like a whole new genre for her that I’m not obsessed with
Sorry lunch. This is my BREAKFAST, LUNCH & DINNER
1 billion go
All that whining is unbearable. And, THE ENTIRE song with eyes closed?
I can’t believe this was 20 min because it felt way too short 😭
15:47 the way Finneas whatches her during this part 😭😭 the whole performance had me in tears
❤
Her brother's guitar sound is so good.Thire voice  is so good. I always feel tiny desk version music is better than any other version .I think tinydesk sound engneer is good at this.
YESSSSSS. I've been waiting for this one!!!
She’s done the tiny desk before I thought??
SHE IS NOT REAL ❤
So amazing
😭😭😭😭😭❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
I know it’s old but I wish she did ocean eyes. 😊
I’m so sad when I get ads in the middle of this, can’t we just put all of them at the beginning? I don’t want the vibe interrupted mid-song lol   But other than that, one of my new favorite episodes! So goood
Better help stealing your info
Sobbing
🤌🏼💥
Didnt sing any of the good songs ugh
Didn't know Ellie's scar-removing surgeon was soo good!
Joyful 🫶🍷🎧
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY BILLIE UR SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO MANY INCLUDING ME :))💗💗

lo mejor de lo mejor !!!!
JUST PERFECT!!!!!! 🖤🖤
5:29
Here before 1M! Billie and Finneas are friggin savants. What a treat to see them on NPR Tiny Desk ❤
I feel like I’m right there and we’re just chilling. this is so special and relaxing
entrar a Youtube y que este está joya 🙏🙏🙏 gracias diosito
UGHH I JUST LOVE HEARING FINNEAS SMM MY BABBY 🖤
billie genia mundial
she and Laufey would do good on a duet.
She would not be much without him.
i’m about to start crying in my study hall time at school right now. the greatest is so meaningful.
Que isso mulher, isso está um espetáculo 🥹 O Brasil te ama ❤🇧🇷
I was 15 /16 when i first listened to Billie and I was going through alot ,her music got me through it and everything that came after. Im 22 now and still cry when listening to her voice  its not  because im sad but I realised I truly healed and survived ❤.
Please don't have ads on Tiny Desk videos! That's abominable!
Im so happy they did I love you, genuinely my favorite song
Billie entregando más de lo mismo
i cry every time i hear her voice
Thanks a lot! It was amazing! 🙏
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!!!
MRÜ!
raw, next question. also i don't know what it is but billie looks supremely irish in this video and im obsessed
Birds of a 🪶
POR FIIIIN
Minha Esposa voltou novamente no NPR. 🫰🖤
Hope she finds the help she needs!🙏
Que bueno, un buen artista no necesita más que eso, muy dulce
I love you Billie
A real Star is a real star because its shining
so beautiful, truly.
So cool~!
MY BABYYY
LOVE ME SOME BILLIE 😊 this was awesome !
13:06 her vocals have matured over time, she sounds so amazing singing i love you 🥹
Congrats on apex level mediocrity.
iconic
Man... I love her voice so much! ♥
NOW, DO PARAMOREEEEEEEE
The Pianist has my heart fr
Who knew that beating drums with spaghetti would sound so good
she's out of this world
yeeeeeees !!! : )
The greatest is one of those songs that got overlooked. I really think The greatest deserves to be top song of her latest album Hit me hard and soft.
Maybe a weird question but I didn't understand the part around 10:49 when she said " I have been not sleeping very much and I haven't woken up past 1 pm except for today for this when I woke up at 9.30" I am not a native speaker so I didn't understand the laughing point there. Can someone explain?
It feels like it's difficult for Billy to perform the last song. Not her performance style/song style. Great respect to her for the fact that despite this she was not afraid to perform the song live! Peace and love!
i hope she puts out a christmas album
god she is so bad at singing
ive been waiting for this one
lesgoooo
15:59
YES she did “i love you” ugh this was an amazing set. Thank you ALLLLLLL
Of course she gonna slay
miau miau miau miau 🎶🎶
11:15
The way i immediately smiled when i saw this in my recommended 😁
Incredibleeeee
im so glad she got another chance to do tiny desk concert 🥲🫶🏽
OHMYGODD
no canto niuna wea buena como una cumbia o alho asi
OMGGGG BEST THING SINCE I SAW THE CHAPPEL ROAN TINY DESK!!!! YESSSSSSSSS
i have nobody to talk to about this
Yessss FINALLLLYYY!!!!
MARVELOUS!!!
The pathetic OooOooOooo in the end of I love you was hilarious
This freaking suits billie , would love to see her tour an unplugged version
She’s so freakin pretty 😍 ❤
We need to see renee rap next!!
Buset billie eillish mendadak kurus amat
Demasiado hermoso ❤
The way finneas looks at Billie in admiration as she’s singing is so beautiful, love this duo so bad😣😣😣😣😣💕
NPR is the most deceiving, insidious 'news' group out there. They sounds so incredibly pleasant as they lie and push their insane agenda on the public....  Tiny Desk concerts are the only thing they do that's good.
the greatest 🥲
Kinda remids me of the jacob collier set
Too short
we've been blessed today, everyone
making the greatest jazzy was the best thing that happened this year
te amooo te amo
billie for bad days
WHAAAAATTTT
SHE PLAYED I LOVE YOU OH MY GOD MY LIFE IS OVER
WDYM SHE DID I LOVE YOU 😭😭😭😭 Obsessed
I love her so that it hurts
Billie & Finneas harmonizing together was just perfect
so I actually just busted everywhere thanks NPR 😛
Boo better help. Please don't accept more sponsorship from them.
Nice to see William Eyelash paying respects to the little folk
did not expect to cry over this
She’s ok
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH OMG😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Who’s still watching this in 3024!? Timeless!
this is fkn amazing
Obrigado Billie por criar arte, criar música, criar sentimentos e emoções.
I could listen to Billie all day for the rest of my life I can’t believe I won’t get to see her in concert for this album 😭 my Spotify top5 this year were all from the album
lm going through a bad time and this great show makes me feel so much better. I say it again thank u for saving my life
20 minutos? tava com pressa filha pqp em.
Love her. Grateful to grow with her and excited for the next sick beats
te amo billie eilish
Please do an episode with Lana Del Rey ✨
I never clicked so fast
Placing ads in the middle of the songs is devilish work
this young lady has matured so very very well. what a great future she has ahead of her.
Tiny Desk a citar português para fazer sobre a Billie Eilish era uma coisa que não estava à espera, lindo
Production on this is fantastical!!!
Amazing!
god she’s amazing
OMG THEY BRING BACK I LOVE YOU 😭😭
11:57 when she sang I love u 😢she needs to start playing this song at her concerts
too shooooooortttttttttttt
Beautiful.  Wow.
Her voice is so beautiful and shes so kind hearted i love billiee
WHYYYY I MISS IT
yup, still don't understand the appeal.  The whisper singing is just so weird to me, Like, you're not performing in a Library
Beautiful
Loved it, melted, so beautiful❤ what a lucky crowd.
billie has been looking as ethereal as her voice sounds. Truly mesmerising 💗💗
therapeutic
Billie eilish is my everything <3 <3 <3
Thank you 🙏🏽🫶🏽
Please,  watch it in 1.5x playback speed......
So lovely to see her again
halimaw ka billie! ❤

14:07 youre welcome
la cabrita
Saudade <3
So lovely!
I LOVE YOU BILLIE EILISH 🥹❤️✨
Tbh this kind of sucks, surprisingly mediocre performance from her.
Sometimes the tiny things are the truly great ones. Always loved the Tiny Desk Concerts for being intimate, direct and pure
omg the common mistakes make remember that she is human and make me want to cry even more from happiness, that gives her the magic touch
ROSÉ IN TINY DESK PLEASE ❤️
THE WAY I STARTED BALLING WHEN SHE SAID THEYRE PLAYING I LOVE YOU
The Greatest 💙🥹
This video is so perfect
The fact that Billie and Finneas can create such a raw, emotional connection through their live performances is unreal. 'I Love You' hit differently in this Tiny Desk. Absolute chills. Can we just take a moment to applaud their artistry AND the sound engineer for making this masterpiece happen? 🙌✨
Sheeesh
Ugh it’s just so🤌✨ she’s so amazing 🥰
been waiting for this
she looks so beautiful naturally😮
this is the perfect thing to come home to after a long day 🙌
I got home to put my beats on and listen to this masterpiece. Oh, my heart. 🥹💕
how not to be in love with her music ?
it’s like seeing god watching her perform.
So many good chills on this video, it's not surprising her and her band are on top of the world currently. Finneas is so cool as well, I'm a fan.
The Greatest is so perfect...❤ I have no other words
20:59  😭😭🫶🏻🫶🏻
love this set by her and the band sm
Her singing on the greatest sounds so much like Billie Marten now. It's pretty.
i missed this.
It’s crazy how Billie Eilish doesn’t look like E-40 in this performance for once! What’s this era gonna be called?!
COMO ESPERE ESTE MOMENTOOOO
oh god the ads are already horrible, but BETTER HELP?? GOOD LORD Tiny Desk!
Her voice❤❤❤
MDS DO CÉU EU AMO ESSA MULHER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i swear everytime i hear her sing, it’s like im in a whole new universe 😩 ate and left no crumbs 🤌🏽😍
Thank you for bringing me this treasure
Billie's voice is angelical
I'm still crying with I love you
❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
❤❤❤❤❤
miau miau miau miau º3
How does one get better and more angelic
5 hours ago is flirty af 💅🏼
Wow! Tiny Desk is a becoming a necessary stop for the biggest artists.
Vieron como no pronunciaba completamente el "i love you" en el coro
Laufey does slow melancholy way better
she sings so effortlessly
Finally !!!!
🎶Miau miau miau miau 🎶🎶😻
When she said “I’m gonna go girl today” I felt that 😂
BILLIEEEE
B e a u t I f u l 🦚
19:00 why is that guy singing? It sounds so bad. Attention seeking behavior
Shout out to the band for wearing ties.  😀
fua wacho paco y catriel hicieron que hasta la billie quiera cantar
JUST SUSCRIBE FOR THE BEST TINY DESK

IT WAS WORTH WAITING FOR
Billie is The Greatest

WE NEED SABRINA CLAUDIO PLEASE
I dropped what I was doing when I saw this on my YT feed.  As a 70yo guy (whose younger self looks like Abe the piano player) seeing someone with this talent is still special.
1 minute in already crying, wow billie💙
No se puede expresar con palabras lo que hace sentir escuchar a billie 😍😍😍
when she started talking about the song from wwafawdwg I knew it was I love you and nearly cried
😭😭😭😭
Soooo cool. ❤
Didn't realize how much an acoustic version of The Greatest would destroy me, but it was worth it. Thank you Tiny Desk and Billie 💙
100K Likes and over half a million views in less than 6 hours... Billie is an icon beyond belief. Love her always.
wow i was not expecting her to sing I love you but hearing her sing one of my favs after so long hit😭 why'd i get teary eyed
Stripped back and awesome
Never really listened to Billie before. No reason other than I’m old and it’s hard to keep up but what a beautiful voice she has!
she sings so effortlessly, like her voice is made for singing
Finally!
Qué regalo tan bonito. GRACIAS
te amo
el mejor hasta el momento
She has the perfect face for radio.
Not doing bad guy should be a crime
Shes so special to me
love her
Ugh the greatest was so fckn amazing

One of the better Tiny Desk Concerts I've seen. Man is she incredible.
Cómo que no canto todo el álbum?????
Total once in a generation superstar!
Not a fan of the setlist but still watching it anyway
The fact that we only got four songs is so bittersuite.

They have to release acoustic versions. This is easily my favorite version of her music I’ve heard.
The Lennon-McCartney of our age :)
Omg, this is REVVING.
❤ from 🇹🇹
Her skills of portraying her stories through facial expressions and gestures when singing are so admirable. I'm in awe.
Can’t wait for the Tiny Desk Unplugged album 😊
her humming is so majestic istg… and the fact that her birthday is in less than a week makes this feel so special

this performance of i love you was so emotional im so glad she played this. so beautiful
i was gushing tears during i love you, that song is such a sentimental song to me
Tiny desk sounding great as always, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD can you just put the ads literally anywhere else but in the middle of the song????  On the other hand, The Greatest sounded amazinnnnnggg🥰
Incredible, I had never heard any of those tracks and I instantly love all of them. Amazing!
THEY'RE SO GOOD MAKES ME WANNARHQUGWBFIUKWUFH
Stop supporting better help. PLEASE! Its just sad.

Just....amazing. What talent (both of them). Billie makes me feel it all. I'm obsessed with her voice :)
My ears were blessed with these performances, I loved them, but 'The Grestest?' was so beautiful, I cried because how gorgeous and wonderful the Finneas and Billie's performance was 😭
Billie is not for a good weather, or to party. Billie is a whole winter season, the best winter of the world.
T amo billielis
I LOGGED INTO YOUTUBE AT THE PERFECT TIME AHHHHH LETS GOOOOOOO
This is my first time checking her music. I know she's a star I just haven't paid attention to top 40 for a long time. This is nice!
i love this so much. the talent is insane. and ahh i would love to hear her sing your power for the last time 😩
Need a part two NEOWWWWW
Wish she had a back up harmony and Billie gives me chills
the way she says "man am i the greatest / god I hate it" at the end of THE GREATEST is THE GREATEST
Got here before 1 million views!
Hello from Greece!  Such an overwhelming performance! Finneas and Billie we reaĺly love you!  I am a Morrissey, The Cure and Depeche Mode fan and now i am yours! Love you, long live and be well! ❤❤❤

Man... was watching my favorite series when saw this came up today, stoped everything,turned volume up and had the best 20 mins in a while... pure talent ❤ god bless her.
just realised billie looks like ellie from tlou 2
THE PIANIST IS FINE AF 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
Love love love Billie. Like she’s one of few that sounds like the album and Hit Me Hard and Soft was one record this year where I didn’t skip and just listened to the whole thing with my Tik Tok attention span. So much love to her and Finneas ❤
Really about the only that could follow Doechii...nice job @Tiny desk!
I'm only a minute in and this is already hitting me in the chest. This was by far my favorite album this year. I hope she grabs that AOTY award. 💙💙💙
we want this on the spotify man
SZA TINY DESK PLEASEEEEE
BRO
YIPPIIEEE
That moment when goosebumps start to rise... 16:00
Tiny Desk is on fire this year 🔥
I’m 28 years old, and I’m obsessed with Billie like a teenager putting up posters in their room. 😂
it gave me goosebumps
I think I will never get over how beautiful both her voice and her face are when she's singing. ❤
godd her voice is so clean i think thats what makes us addicted
So glad they got Billy and Finneas on the tiny desk!
BILLIE ON TINY DESK YESS oh my god yes!!!!!   but, BOO BETTERHELP

Even though I know that Billie is brilliant, she just blows my mind every time I listen to her ❤❤❤❤❤
Her voice is so perfect for Christmas. Billie it's a must for you to release a Christmas album.
Their vocal harmonies and tonal chemistry is unmatched. You can see through their collaborations that they truly began their musical journeys together and have been hand in hand from the start.
This video will be legendary.
Doechii then billie 🎉🎉
God I’m so excited to see her in a few days. I literally cannot contain myself 😭
17:23 me, a nb masc, whenever I paint my nails, have long hair or don't use a binder outisde lol
Wow, that thumbnail. She looked exactly the way she did before fame. 🥹
She certainly is a great performer with excellent way of delivering a message to the people.
those vocal runs on Birds of a feather were already incredible and somehow she made them 20x better here , she did not come to play bro
15:27 I want to know what happen there 😭
So lovely.
SHE DIDN’T SING WILDFLOWER 😢😢😢😢
Need every artist ever to do a tiny desk
Please come to Morocco 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
ALL THE CHRISTMAS BONUSES GETTING PAID FROM THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO.....10MIL VIEWS BY 12/31.....BET IT🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑💰💰💰🥁🥁🥁
Can YouTube PLEASE stop playing ads MIDWAY through songs 😭 So freaking annoying. I don’t mind the ads in general, just wish they were timed better
я люблю тебя Айлиш!
Tems , Chappell roan, doechii , Dua lipa now Billie who we getting next ?? Ariana grande Sabrina Beyonce doja cat Kendrick cardi b ?? Ooh lord I'm excited
Perfect intonation. She definitely swallowed an Autotune when she was a child
Dang we gettin old ..
this just got me through finals
The NPR music channel is one of the best in the world ❤  Here I have discovered a lot of talented artists I didn’t know existed, also how to deal with my emotions. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful opportunity!!
que mulher linda da peste!!!! que talento mds  melhor tiny desk
Lista de canciones, de nada vvs 1. THE GREATEST 00:20  2. L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 06:44 3. I love you 11:53 4. BIRDS OF A FEATHER 18:25 ❤
can't believe you guys would promote Better Help after the scandal with them scamming the mentally ill and litteraly being the "uber for Therapy" and just letting anyone sell "therapy" on their site.
el mejor que han hecho 💕
howeverythimg comes together, first the focus on her and finneas vocals, then the other instruments, its not just a vibe it's the ocean to get lost in
wow her vocals are amazing in birds of a feather.
meow
cade a coisa brasileira q falaram
My God, this goddess is here
BILLLIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is my mtv
ela é tão linda mds
this audio sounds delicious
I absolutely love Billie but why can't I stop calling her eyelash, darn comedy brain 🧠🤷🏽😂
❤
Tiny desk has becime the new MTV ..only actually better and talented 😂 no shade
Why didn't I get out of this?
she sounds the EXACT same, if not better, compared to the recorded versions of the tracks.
I love when Tiny Desk supports small rising artists. Definitely will check this Billy girl out later!
OMGGGG
There’s moments that her and finneas sing together reminds me of the group XX from back in the day
i never thought we’ll ever see the day that we will have a billie eilish tiny concert desk
Reporting all the ads as illegal 😤
I absolutely hate YouTube for bringing up a Gemini ad at the moment she was gonna sing the high part of the greatest
crying in the club (my bedroom)
claim your here before "2 mil views ticket here" guys!!!!  vv
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
It’s really distracting how the guitar is louder in the right headphone.
Me gusta todo lo que hace! Amamos a billie❤
She seems like the nicest chillest person ever to meet in person
Looks they picked up their band outside of juilliard
The best Super Bowl performance so far 🏆
Es hermoso! Pero termine llorando.😢
Where is wildflower😮😢😢
These three men back of her are brothers?
Necesitaba tanto esto TINY DESK gracias!
That 8:29 bum bum buuuum...
no tiene explicacion lo talentoso que son estos hermanos!! billie con ese vozarron y Finneas con el acompañamiento que hace por dios, ni hablar de la banda detrás!
00:21 THE GREATEST 06:43 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 i love you 18:27 BIRDS OF A FEATHER

I LOV U BILLIE EILISH 💖💖💖
i love her to death! she is the only person in the world that understand me completely! if it weren't her i wouldn't be here, i thank her so much!
What
Whenever I hear I love you I am suddenly 13 again, crying in my bedroom.
Awesome!!🎉❤
Please get Linkin park
I love you for playing I love you 🥹
Awesome. Big fan of Tiny Desk and Billie. Shame that NPR has reeled in an advertiser that is widely known to be a massive fraud and danger to vulnerable people. Do you really need it with these amounts of views?
Por qué no cantó Wildflower? 😢
Wonderful
She doesn’t need this. Give me some indie artists instead!
Mi artista favorita ❤
SHE SANG I LOVE YOU OH MY GOD
Mr drums just chillin in the back until it's his time to come in😂❤️
This is so calming and beautiful ❤
greatest of her generation.
Those two are the real deal. That’s what I told a co-worker when she told me how surprised she was after taking her daughter to a Billie Eilish concert last week. So many great songs ahead from those two.
YALL DID YA GOOD SINGING TODAY!!
🎉🎉
Omg 11:46  I love you 😢💞😘💞😘 I'm crying rn my favorite song
That vocal control oh my word
Putting an ad in the middle of I love you is diabolical
this was great
she's everything to me.
Love the siblings internal joke on Ooh-oooh at 15:24
drop better help PLEASE
I love how finneas looks at Billie and how she looks at him. Their bond is so strong and unique 😌🫶🏽
Can we appreciate the artistry here. Not just a great vocalist but compelete musicians from song writting , phasing , arrangement and melody. One of my favourite albums of 2024 if not my favourite .
Joy Williams long lost sister. Very good
I just know this is going to be very, very good.
This one will deff get 1000000000000000 views
This is beautiful🥺❤️❤️💙💙💙
Yayyyy I knew she’d be here soon! Gotta love Billie
I love Billie and Finneas😭😭😭
hermosa Billie volvio a hacer brillar la Tiny
Chirimoya me paso la voz
Todos esperando el miau miau, miau miau 😔
The way Finneas stares at her during I love you is so wholesome. We’ve seen her perform I love you multiple times and he still looks at her the same way during that song. 🥺
the mastering on the post production of these acoustics have been done by god’s ear. the levels, the crispiness, and the quality… wow.   oh yeah and billie too 🤣 i guess she helped too
GIVE ME FINNEAS'S TINY DESK NOW
literally better than I could have imagined 🥹🤌🏽
i just gasped out loud
Wasn’t expecting “I love you” and I’m sitting by the pool in Mexico crying. Billie you are a gift to this world and I appreciate your art so much ❤️
Ads in the middle of the songs 🤨
can somebody help me out on finness’s sweet lil guitar in the beginning ? thing sounds so good
She literally sang one line and I started tearing up. Her voice is like an angel.
Album pf the year IMO
This is why I pay for YouTube premium
È talmente talentuosa che, anche una donna di 68 anni è riuscita ad amarla mi piace!!!!
❤Beautiful
i love her.
best haired band ever
Finneas!!!!!!! Los amo
wow i can't believe she performed i love you just for me
Yo Billie is so ill 🔥
I loooove seeing billie as the young girl she actually is so real so human she always wears so much toughness in her aura (which I also love)  but she's cute and insecure and lovely and everything and I love them so much I only cried 4 times
Great!
It genuinely makes me so happy to see her happy. Love you Billie 🫶🏻
I’m sitting here crying and laughing because I’m in shock 😂and happy at the same time ❤
no one is doing it like her
They let anyone do a tiny desk now, what a shame.
why is she singing, as if she´s in constant physical pain ?
Really tiny desk? A sponsorship with Better Help. What a joke. Taking money from a company who actively harms the people they claim to help. This is well known information but you either don’t care or didn’t research them before taking their money. Hope the pay check was worth it!
La classe ! Tiny desk fait le choix du haut de gamme !
The Greatest is pure art.
flawless..
betterhelp 💀💀💀
I love boaf but I NEED A LIVE PERFORMANCE OF BITTERSUITE PLEASEEEEE
I love you
This is the closest I’ll get to seeing her on tour
her hair looks so healthy 🥹
She was so adorable here 😅 sounded beautiful like usual too
❤❤❤❤
Greatness
bro i cried during i love u it’s such a special song like ughhhhhhh I LOVE U BILLIE AND ALWAYS WILL
i missed finneas's harmonies so much omg i love themmm
❤❤❤❤❤

It’s not about perfection, it’s about magnetism
zzz
Love her, she’s so underrated as a singer
So thankful I’ve got to hear all these live!!
What a way to end my 2024. Thanks, Billie 🥹❤️
NO ONE WILL EVER UNDERSTAND HIW MUCH I LIVE BILLIE SHE SANG MY FAVORITE SONG I LOVE YOU BAWLING
This should've been at least one hour🥺 thank you tiny desk for this experience tho

¡¡¡Diosa absoluta!!!
NO WAAAYYYY
How many people there, no longer tiny.
Is the vinyl out yet? please?
Desk Vibessssss, nice office outfit
This Channel reminds me of the MTV old days 🎵❤️
Need a version of the entire album with just these instruments.
Of course she is good but also a bit overrated
She started singing - I love you- and I started crying then Billie shut me up with “crying isn’t like u” oh ok
I swear to God, "i love you" get more & more beautiful every time I hear them perform it live😂
Lovely🌹❤
I needed wildflower 🥺
nadie superara el tiny de ca7riel
"saudade"
Beautiful!!
I love you and the greatest on the same acoustic and wonderful vocals. I'm in awe
oh billie i love u
I love this moment in history
Timeless❤
I love Billie!!! Got to go see her in KC. It was AMAZING! I'm a bit older than I think her usual fans are but I love music for her artistic abilities and she for sure has a lot of that on top of a great outlook on life.
Que lloré de lo hermosa de su voz, los amo tanto a los dos ❤❤
Doble gozo , FINNEAS too
Here are no words to explain how much I love Billie eilish,  I’ve been admiring her since I was a kid, I love everything about her, her music, her voice, her personality, her looks, everything, I love Billie eilish more than myself and all I wanna hear my hole life is her.
when a black man is playing the  bass you know it's gonna be bomb
la voz de Billie es irreal
❤❤❤❤❤❤ to everyone!!!!
7:15 AAAAAAAA
this the same chick that tweeted out to her hundreds of millions of young followers "there's a war on women" after Kamala Harris lost the election? absolutely disgusting if you ask me.
I wish I could be there for the live performance. Too beautiful
SHE IS AMAZING ARTIST!
MY EARS HAVE BEEN BLESSES ONCE AGAIN
Amazing
Cuando sacará el dúo con Aurora sería maravilloso.
❤❤❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
FINALLY
Unspeakably exquisite!
Yep, I love this. ❤
Drum and Bass sound terrible on this. They rushed the sound for sure.
Why she’s do pretty
Her voice is a cool stream you could rest yourself on if you're tired.
Thank you so much, i needed this.
who is on the keys, he is killing me with those looks?👀👀😭😭❤
Can we get Yebba?!
One Billie checked off the list. Billy Strings next?!!!

Yup we were gonna get the most views in Tiny Desk in 2-3  years later
I love you so much O'Connell brothers 💞🇦🇷 @billieeilish ➕ @finneas
15:45 I’m being sent to heaven . The end note has me floatingg
TE AMO BILLIE
OH MY FUCKIJG GOSHHHH
Why is no one talking about  how she changed that one note in “I love you “ as she did in that one concert ?? I LOVE IT 15:58
Her lipstick shade is perfect does anybody know what it is 😅
Cómo puedes tener esa voz 🥹🤍🤍🤍🤍✨
Finneas casually switching guitars every song 🔥
i feel like she started this with the greatest and l'amour de ma vie specifically for me hahaha those are my favourites from the new album
GOAT
Dioooossss Billie! 🫶✨ terribleeeee! gracias y gracias el tiny siempre!
The vocal intro to l'amour was everything
The audio mix is absolutely incredible, I'm so obsessed 🥹
this is one of the most important things to me i’m freaking out guys. vanity fair and this? i’m gonna faint.
I've never heard any Billie songs except for one that one of my guitar students asked me to teach her. Her and her brother are very good songwriters and performers.
I just died
The fact she is able to sing like this live is breathtaking
Oow❤
i love billie sm 😭❤️💖
can‘t stop smiling ❤️😊
Love youu billieee
THAT BAM BAM BAM WAS SO CUTE
my jaw dropped when i saw this on my fyp
OMG
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you reminds me of the chords in Halleluja.
we need this on spotify PLEASE
'I love you' has always been a favorite of mine, you knocked that out of the park omg it was perfect
Well, who else's Roman Empire now? ;D
Love your art P + B. Thank you so much for creating and sharing with us. 🌍 🫶🏽
The breath work she’s done has really paid off. So so so good
Chills all over listening to you live Billie! Im in tears…I love you & your music is amazing! You are an amazing person & artist! My daughter & I have bonded over your music!❤️
her voice is so angelic😍😍😍
i think i just died
LETS FREAKING GO
🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
finneas is so underrated
12:00 I’m confused cause when she did the song live she said it was for xxxtentacion and cried on stage but now she’s saying she wrote it at 16.
Make this vinyl and blu-ray asap
i love 'i love you' but i wasnt expecting to cry as soon as i woke up. But i do love hearing how much her voice has matured
🙌🏻
Is it me or is the greatest very radiohead 🤔 very very good regardless
Incredible performance! ❤
Billie es irreal, la amo
muito incrivel a sensação de ter acompanhado ela desde o inicio e notar o quanto ela cresceu e amadureceu, love u billie
I love you sounds a little similar to Leonard Bernstein's Hallelujah
i felt like it was just yesterday that it was 2016 and i was trying to get my friends to listen to this new song i was obsessed with. i’m so glad she’s such a big artist now and gets so much love. she deserves it all and more.
Crying
I fear this has changed who I am as a person
OH. MY. GOD
WOW!!!! Tremendaaaa!!!! 🔥
I’m gonna cry
always impressive to see how she’s grown and what she’s capable of. what a lovely bond you guys have 💗 sending happiness💗💗
There is a scratch on her arm. I wonder how that happened 🤔
AHHH SHE PLAYED I LOVE YOU IM ACTUALLY SOBBING
This is just…wow
The bottle slide was so smoothhhhh
finneas doing the backing vocals is the best
Ahhhhhhh, so excited! Finneas gets my nomination for best big brother (celebrity edition). They're amazing. Merry Christmas to all of us!
can't describe in words how this part 4:49 makes me feel so ecstatic, just grateful to be alive and hear this beautiful song, omg it's like a new calming day, a new beginning
The bottle slide was so smoothhhhh
❤
Why is there commercials between this!! 😭
Solo!! 🎉👏🏾👏🏾🦾
Billie and her brother are literally the best,,,,,,,,,i really love their songs❤,,,,and just how angelic Billie's voice is
can we get FINNEAS a tiny desk concert for his new album too??
billie eilish AND finneas: tiny desk concert
queen
❤❤
TE AMO
the musicians need to drop their curly hair care routine!
worst placement of ads
they really need to have their folklore era now. her voice and finneas' like this sound like the civil wars and they can make haunting indie folk pop for an entire album. imagine them and hozier together. also bon iver, sufjan stevens, iron & wine, the lumineers... i mean... IMAGINE
yayyy!! claudia finally got finneas's hair out of the "karen" phase . . . kind of
15:58 til the end of the song has me 😭😭😭😭🩷
Oh look its Billie and normal desk concert
How about wildflower?
Great sound billie
Love you Billie, love from the tron in New Zealand ❤❤❤❤
SHES SO PERFECT
DIOSMIO
Now we need a Finneas tiny desk and Billie doing the chorus
Marry me please!
on another note: thank u tiny desk for cooperating with better help… mental health matters!
Captivating and wholesome :)
This is a masterpiece
<3
She has a hauntingly beautiful voice wow
started off with my favorite song in this album 🗣️🗣️
The thing I love the most about Billie and Finneas is that seem like decent, well-raised people.
Wow. BetterHelp? Really? Just the biggest letdown right there....
Amy´d love dat

I’m singing together “ I don’t think I CAN LOVE YOU MORE!!❤
Como la amo es mi idolaaaaaaaaaaaa
can't believe she sang I LOVE YOU!!!! OMG I LOVE THIS SONG
😊❤🥰🥰😍😻😻😼😼😼👌👌👌👌
Love u 😘😘😘
I’m 52..Managed to completely miss out on this talent. Until ‘Hit me Hard and Soft’, has won me and my generation over and it’s just gaining strength. I also loved ‘What was I made For’. I love the whole family. ❤
Tbis performance gives me power.
Amazing sound engineers as always. Seem to bring out great performances here! What a great venue.
In Bird of a feather you can confirm that she needed a longer sleep 😅
Her vocal control is unparalleled. Way beyond her years. Looking forward to seeing her perform at the LA Forum next week!
Beautiful  Billie eilish
0:21 the greatest 6:44 l'amour de vie 11:53 i love you
I was like how can they top Doechii?…. Now how can they top Billie?? They need Beyoncé on the next one 😂
Holy rack-a-molie!
It hurts to believe that you can't scream live. 🥲
Billie is absolutely gorgeous‼️Even when she sings live its amazing she always hits those notes I love her and Finneas soo mucn❤
lit
Nice to see Finneas and Billie together ! 😀
Прямо скажем, еë вокал не поражает. Всë ещë удивлена масштабом еë успеха

BILLIE EILISH THE GOAT
The birds of a feather were clearly flightless.

Preciosa como siempre
SHE GOT ANOTHER ONEEEEEEE
I love the way Finneas looks at her when she sings those high notes, pure admiration and love

"Saudade is a Portuguese word that can be roughly defined as a feeling of melancholy, nostalgia or yearning for something that is beloved but not present. There's no perfect translation, but one of the closest English expressions of the word I've ever seen is Billie Eilish's Tiny Desk performance." from video info, nailed it.
As a parent, they have the relationship that you hope your children would have.
❤❤❤❤

Now we have billie we need to get Sabrina carpenter here too!
Literally love her but was bird of a feather off or was I hearing it wrong
PSA: Betterhelp is selling your information to advertisers who can use this information exploit your mental health issues. Sad to see that big channels like this are still advertising companies that are actively profiting from and exploiting people with mental health issues. It gives legitimacy to a horrible amoral company.
Best Christmas gift! Thank you so much!
So Chill
I soooo wanted her to sing wildflower❤❤❤❤
Clairo next!!
❤❤❤❤
i hatee the commercialll 😢😢
We all love Billie here, obviously, but we should not stand for this concert having Better Help as a sponsor. They are an EXCEEDINGLY dodgy company and people should not be taking on contracts with them!
drummer looks like Gale Boetticher from Breaking Bad
⭐
Best female vocalist 😊🫶🔥
Her voice is as beautiful as she
W to Billie I love you
OMG!!! this one and the Paco Amoroso & Ca7riel are my favorites <3 thank u, thank u, thank u

Her voice , her aura , her style ✨✨

8:28 "bu bu bu* 😩
Maravilhosa como sempre amo as suas músicas e sua voz 🎹🇧🇷🙏🏿🎧
Nothing special about any of these nepo baby stars the industry pushes. Band did a great job though!
NPR and Tiny Desk, thank you for bringing us Billie! Billie's voice is just magical! The Greatest still makes me cry even though I've listened to it countless times. Billie and Finneas are one of a kind and I hope they know that.
I WAS HERE
Does CA7REIL El poco win last month????????????
Absolutely incredible.
Thank you
WHAT A MASTERPIECE
her reaction at the end of l'amour de ma vie is exactly how i felt the first time i heard it yep yep
Whoever put the add in the middle of The Greatest should be fired
SHE PLAYED I LOVE YOU SHE PLAYED I LOVE YOU SHE PLAYED I LOVE YOU!!!! AAAAAA THIS IS THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER!!! IT IS MY BIRTHDAY TODAY IEEEE.

Billie Eilish’s voice 🤝 Tiny Desk’s audio engineer
8:24
I don't know what i'm crying for (lit) 🥹
Lots of vocal control , subtle , heartfelt and precise .Just a wonderful performance !
Finneas >>>>>>>>>>>
This is GOLD I wish they would drop acoustic versions
348083
I swear I started levitating 🥹 they are both  so talented !!
As a new Billie Eilish fan, I've been waiting for a stripped back performance like this. I know Billie is incredibly talented, but I have NEEDED these pure vocals. Her voice is gorgeous. And Finneas is an amazing producer. The new album is incredible.
✨️🥂🩵👏🏽🩵🥂✨️
IVEE BEEN WAITING 🥹
Tiny Desk unknowingly giving us the best December gift.
okay 3 hours is still early this ate and im happy she finally was able to do it in person
we need a FINNEAS Tiny desk please!!!
I absolutely ADORED Billie's concert in Toronto. I want to see FINNEAS someday too i love them so much.
How is she real 😭
didn't see this one coming, and it's awesome  !
She's a megastar that somehow makes it still feel so real and so personal. It's an incredible gift. it doesn't feel fake or overproduced. Truly astounding.
OMG 👉❤️✨! Aí meu coração!
I loved ❤
DYING CUS WHAT THE
I'm betting Billie took this as her chance to wear The Office's aesthetic for herself and the whole crew LOL
Love from Ukraine
POST THESE ON SPOTIFY ASAP
Saudades NPR
I love how her brother looks at her and seems to look so proud of his little sister! They both have amazing voices!
Own up - who styled the band?
Thank you ❤
The way ads violently interrupt this concert... horrible.
Who knew broom and drum goes together 😂
I LOVE YOU BILLIE OMG
I usually listen heavy metal, but man I love her voice so much
every hatters need seee thiss
Só comforting
I really wanted her to sing wildflower 😢
The note change at 16:00 is everything and more
I love you
I've been listening to Billie since 2018 😢 it's so amazing to see how much shes grown. Love you Billie ❤
Tiny
This is incredible. Her voice is a gem and these harmonies just make it that much better
i love her so much
I Love You will always be my favorite
Now all you guys have to do is bring Daniel Caesar back too🙏🏽
Known her since she was 15, so glad i am able to watch her grow
This video made my 50$ speakers sound like 5000$
It was so wonderful that I can't say anything🌚❤️‍🔥
wonderful show. the dance between different parts of the band was beautiful had some really special moments.
I’m in love
Exquisite, intimate performance from our remarkable Billie. No lasers. No smoke. No goofy traps doors. Just Billie and her band, stripped bare for all to witness - and wasn’t she just brilliant. Bravo! 👏
I think billie will be my fav artist in every lifetime.
She is a gorgeous and very talented young lady, those eyes.  Love that she plays and sings with her super talented brother. Great harmony!
Tiny Desks should never be interrupted by ads. Front load the ads and let the music play!
I love you  was about her falling in love for the first time??? What? With who? If it is the one in my head....
Can we talk about that better help sponsoring please?
The way she sings I Love You is very reminiscent of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah
i love you is one song i can never get over
billie looking like she came straight from private school still in uniform here 😭
I'm literally crying this Tiny Desk is f**ing amazing :') love you so much Billie
its hard to do thissss . but she perfectly do it
tiny desk and vanity fair? thank youu billieeee!
Wow💫
Where is chihiro pleaaaaase😭😭😭😭
soo magic
I need this on vinyl and Apple Music🙏
Oh Billie… we love you so much 🥲❤️‍🔥 what a force you are
HERMOSO❤
Wooooow!! I love this girl so much ❤❤❤
Expect the unexpected
vocalist of our generation let's be serious
Billie Eilish is one of the fallen angels/ demons that got kick out from heaven for their rebellion. A lot of them are in this generation ( celebrities, politicians, scientists) Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon🙏🏼❤️🕊Repent, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again
Anamaria Sayre i love your writing
❤❤❤ Sending love
Magic
She sings soo good 💙❤️‍🔥
All I want is to go to a tiny desk one time in my life.
The "wow" from an audience member after she finished i love you was so real
Although I disagree with her politically, the actual art displayed in this video is beyond belief. What a phenomenal and beautiful performance.
historic moment
Name a better sibling working duo? I’ll wait. They have so much respect for each other and work together and separately well.
whyd I decide to watch this at work. I love you came on and now im sobbing
I didn't expect I love you 😭
Just imagine their mom
That voice..... 🥰😃
Crying in the break room at work during lunch 😭
I screamed out of frustration when a commercial came in between
ita crazyyy very very live . live on live
Love all the concerts on this channel.. ❤I can’t wait for Finneas  tiny desk concert too!!
Billie is genuinely a legend ❤  Edit: is it just me or does she kind of look like she’s “suffering” while performing THE GREATEST??? Like I’m not sure because I haven’t seen her perform it before😅
What's so special  about her voice? She basically whispers a little bit louder 😂😂😂
I'm obsessed ❤
Manifesting me doing Billie’s hair in 2025
SCREAMING CRYING THROWING UP 😭
FEED US MOTHER
Christmas came early
beautiful
I love you billie I love you!
Gosh she is just the best
beautiful performance. beautiful audio engineering.
We want Lana!!!
Que voz Billie la ptmr ❤
I'm in love ❤
En q minuto esta chihiro?
i love you will always be in my top 5 billie songs
Billie Eilish is and always will be one of my favorite voices, no matter how popular she becomes. Love her!
angel voiceeeeeee🥺🥺🥺
I would really love to see her doing tiny desk again in the future! cause this was really good
THE NOTE CHANGE ON I LOVE YOU HAD ME SCREAMING!!!!!!
It's like her voice is made by angels and they've been handing her brother sheet music ❤ beautiful concert 🐱
so relaxing
Last song is based on an upbeat version of bleeding love by leona Lewis is it not?
Doechii and now Billie? NPR is really spoiling us 😭
literally crying
my babyyyyyyyyyy
Blood harmonies are always the best.....these kids are ridiculously talented....... kudos to the band 👏🏼
YEEEEEAHHHH
Been waiting for this for soooooooo long, the first time was not fair to her, during the pandemic, but man was it worth the wait. her voice had done leaps and bounds. and her brother man we can't say enough for what he does for her music and her live performances, they are both something out this word. true musicians and artist!
Genios
te amo Billie gracias 🫂
Huge massive virtual love and hugs to you all. Especially you Billie. You're eyes bring the natural sunlight to even the sunniest of days. Xx
About time!! This was overdue!!
No CHIHIRO? No SKINNY?
love me some billie
la cabra
betterhelp??? this late in the year???
imaginate ser los papas de billie y finneas... que emoción ver a tus hijos hacer música juntos
Bro Tuesday needs to HURRY UP
We were all just witnessing a moment in musical history… ❤
Ok but Finneas you look at her with soooo much love! Best brother ever for sure 🤍
Her knees are damaged, she must have been praying for a long time.
Antes del millón y ya está rompiendo mi ❤️
l’amour de ma vie 💙
♥
Disappointed with the betterhelp sponsor
Baby is nervous especially on Birds of a Feather. 🥺💙🤍🙌🏽
In this version I can understands the words on the last song  🙃
Best Tiny Desk I’ve seen by far and I’ve almost watched them all
Yeah, I'm gonna need them to come back and do the whole new album please. Thank you
Having her & Finn back together again warms my heart sm🥹
15:19  omg she’s so funny😂
24k in the premiere and 300k after 3 hours. insane for a tiny desk. so glad she could finally do one in person
We need a Tiny Desk with Jamiroquai 😭
My girlll💗💗💗

<3
She's incredible

🤩😍
Billie y Finneas los amo con mi vida entera
You can tell it’s an audience audience there listening and watching 😂❤ this is so beautiful like this is my early Christmas gift 🎁
Unsubscribed
the way I SCREAMED when I realized she was about to sing i love you
this is true art. once in a lifetime show. deep heart felted gratitute to Billie, Finneas and their Great musicians
Violão horroroso, ae Billy contrata um violão brasileiro pra você vê o bicho não pega !?
WOW... I love a solid and pretty vocal performance. She delivers just that and then the lyrics.  🤯👏🏾👌🏾🫶🏾
I FLIPPING ADORE BILLIE SO MUCH ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY
Her voice is so gorgeous. I love the intimacy of Tiny Desk and how much more isolated the voices of the artists are. It really helps you appreciate their vocals a lot more and it is fun to watch everyone playing!!!!
Make Knocked Loose Tiny Desk happen.   I dare you. Double dog dare yall.
15:59 😢
oh surely I am sat
so nonchalent
She struggled with "I love you" (based on her little coughs and clearing her throat) so Finneas jumped in singing a bit more/louder with her :) He continuously checks up on her as well
they were made to make music together. truly.
OH MY GOD
Finneas should do a Tiny Desk next ❤
So beautiful, so so beautiful!
4:17 insanity Ms Eilish 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🌟🥹🌟🥹🌟🥹🌟
Seeing her in Glendale tomorrow 🤗🤩🥹
Amazing!🙌🏽❤️🙌🏽
🔥🔥🔥
UN BODRIO! donde quedaron catriel y paco??
I love you got me cryinggg
Thank God for their parents giving them the space to express themselves as kids. A true inspiration.
Ads in the MIDDLE OF A SONG??? Come on NPR, you’re better than that.
i was like omg i  didnt know she had one !!!! uploaded yesterday!!! i love it
Mega talent!!!
Lorddddddddddddd
Kinda sad she didn’t do wildflower but she crushed it as always. Glad some of the other songs from the album got their moment
God her voice is so flawless
Takes me back to those early videos of her, she's still got it. Really fun and enjoyable performance
i like
I love it sm❤ Now we need a Finneas Tiny Desk Concert
shes so tiny and cute i love her
David Luiz playing drums now?
Aaaaaa🎉🎉🎉 billliiiee
Escuchar este Tiny después de Doechii me da pena
Billie is whatever she thinks she is ❤
everytime i think i can't be more amazed by Billie and Finneas they prove me wrong...
I was not into Billie so much. I mean, I've ALWAYS known she has actual talent but even so I wasn't a big fan, until now!! Wow, her voice and Finnea's blend harmoniously since track 1 I couldn't stop. I opened the video just for curiosity and now it's the 3rd time I've watched it WHOLE.
during watching this i watched the views go up nearly 50k. beautiful billie <3
Saudade 🇧🇷
Amo la música de Billie y es lo mejor que he escuchado.❤
the note change at “i love you” hits different
6:41 the way they all looked at him, he is getting fired😭🙏
she is feeding us with contentttttt
22 nd 35 minutes of billie and finneas !!!!!
Jesus. I just love her. I’m so proud of her 🥹🥹🥹
Billie eilish I lvoe you
SO GOOD😭😭😭😭😭
her voice has grown so much, her control over it is insane
❤❤❤
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG <3
Billie looks beautiful ❤️
💙💙💙
✨✨✨ LOVE LOVE ♥️
incredible. breath taking.
It was too short ❤❤❤❤❤❤
beautiful
Her new album is such a masterpiece.
bird of feather,melody totally stolen(piano)
my guy at the piano had a cymbal at his neck the whole time!! lol had to play precariously...
I’m on my lunch break sobbing to this 😿🙏🏼
billie is truly  the greatest
I love billie sm since I was 13!! I’m almost 20 now😭
I remember growing up watching MTV Unplugged and enjoying seeing the stripped-down version of artists and their songs. NPR is definitely bringing that same experience to the forefront
I love them so much omg
Oh my gosh I’ve been waiting for this
this is beautiful ,thank you Billie and Finneas
BILLIE THE WOMAN THAT YOU ARE!!!!!!❤❤
suuuuch a beautiful voice man, I love them bothhhhhhh
her vocals always bring me to tears, the emotion OMG
Shoutout to whoever wrote the description. That was very nicely written
Billie have been to a party from puff daddy?😏🥵
Avocados Assemble! 🥑🥑🥑🥑
NEEDED THIS
She's so pretty!
thank you tiny desk for this one 🫡
Que delícia ouvir Billie no acústico ❤❤
This is what I’ve waited my whole life, I’m obsessed
HMHAS album came out a couple days after my best friends passed away and boaf really hits because of her so I cant listen to it without crying
"I love you" will always be the saddest and most beautiful song of all time.
That bass is so foundational
sucks this is sponsored by better help
Primeiro comentário brasileiro???
I can listen to these guys for hours and hours on end . The more Intimate the better.
We need King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard on NPR please,
i was literally watching Billie’s live performances yesterday and now i see this
I’m crying, she did the I love you note change
la amo
Of course they started with The Greatest…..😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
Ooohhh finally! I was just thinking about when this was gonna happen!!! Greattt, go BIILIE
SOSOSO GLAD THEY DECIDED TO DO I LOVE YOU, imo still their best lyrics and one of their best songs to this day
her singing I LOVE YOU with the NOTE CHANGE  is my Roman Empire
this is like an early christmas present!!
I love how I discover new songs through NPR. I mean, I've known Billie since Ocean Eyes but I'm not one to listen to her entire discography. NPR concerts are like "these are the best songs in my opinion, as the artist who owns them, I love these 4 songs the most at the moment."
I just saw her perform last night in San Jose. She’s incredible!!
Preparándome para ver algo impresionante
Easily one of the best artists of recent years. Full of emotion in her voice, manners and beautiful gaze. Credit also to Phineas who doesn't have the main focus on himself but perfectly complements his sister. Compliments to the rest of the band and obviously to those who produce these small, great shows whose duration becomes short due to their quality. As I've read and agree, the true successors of MTV's Unplugged from the 90s.
we say saudade when we miss something or someone actually
My cheeks hurt from smiling for the whole 23 minutes
We need a tiny desk best of for 2024!!
Such a good performance 💖💖
Oh this just made my day
Billie during I Love You😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I'm trying my best to listen to other things wether than just Billie, but she's making it impossible!
The ad placements are SOOO disrespectful. smh
I am SO in love with her.
Que presente, to muito feliz <3
This is my curly band
I needed this
beautiful. Happy to live in the same timeline as her🥹❤️
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Never clicked faster on a video
alan davies killing it on the drums
The only flaw of this video is that it's too short 😭😭
Te amo
OMG i don't wait this tiny desk i loved😮🎉
Is there a button bigger than like cause I LOVE this?!?!? ❤❤
the guy needs to shut up jesus chris
This is easily at Mac Miller or C. Tangana's TD tier
Finneas and Billie perfect perfect 😭🫶
This is way too short This is a crime 😭😭😭
Where’s wildflower 😭 it’s a crime
I am a thirty-year-old man from Belarus and I adore Billie Eilish! It is very cool, thank u tiny desk💕💕
fak
THE NOTE CHANGE.
:,) beautiful <3
so excited, all these new people will be discovering NPR and its awesomenesssss... bless Tiny Desk curators, 2024 was outstanding
goosebumps
Can we get a clairo tiny desk thoooo
Okay, NPR, you brought up a reference to the Portuguese language, now it's time to do a Portuguese language month, like what happened with El Tiny and we didn't see any Brazilians.
lovely stuff!
en que han transformado paquito?  :(
This gig was important to them. They turned their band of two into a quintet. They had their sidemen show up wearing ties. The sidemen btw were as tasteful as it gets. It was a very big crowd watching them at their tiny desk.
4:47 ugh yesss
Who's the awesome men in the back ?
THIS IS EVERYTHING!!!
Simple perfect.
0:20 - THE GREATEST 6:40 - L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:50 - i love you 18:25 - BIRDS OF A FEATHER
before i even hear this, i KNOW our girl ATE. this is her ZONE
Finally….Finally….Finally…..❤
Why is this not longer???
I'm sorry but I didn't like it 😮 fell asleep in the middle of it.
I love Billie so much
This made my day!
I love you is a masterpiece
Them❤ that's it.
素晴らしい歌声姉ちゃん。
This is how I fell in love with her, way back when it was just her and Finneas on acoustic, doing Copycat in those mahogany sessions (still my favorite performance). There's something truly magical about them, wish I had a family like theirs.
i can't believe they sang i love you i'm so happy
Please upload this on spotify 🙏🙏 i need it
Is it only the npr staff that gets to be the audience?
BILLIE MY FAV GIRLY POP
IS THIS REAL?!?!?!?!?
♥♥♥♥♥
ooooooo shes looking extraaaa gorgeous
her singing i love you brings so many memories 😭💔
was hoping she’d do the note change on i love you🥹🥹it sounded so beautiful
TE AMO. BILLIE
finneas complements her so well they’re such an iconic duo 💖
live love laugh Billie eilish
I’m a big big fan, but honestly this wasn’t their best show. But whatever, I love her
finneas complements her so well they’re such an iconic duo 💖
Kinda wish “what was I made for” was in this set, but wow, what a performance.
billie sos lo mejor q me pasó realmente
wait it’s so sweet she and finneas are able to be there in person this time
yes Yes YES YESSSS!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Love the song choices so far ♥️ beautiful people! amazing gifts for us to hear
Try looking for Torin Frost and Lauren Santi you'll like them too😉 Signs of the Devine from their Imaginal Disc Pt.I: Metamorphosis of the Caterpillar is my favorite!
Feels like an early christmas gift ❤❤❤❤
lo único malo de la sesión es que se me hizo corta
here before this hit 10m
amazing. but where is the miau miau miau miauuuu?
well Orangewood are about to sell a few more Juniper's
the description😢
Simply amazing.
This music is so boring and premeditated. It just lacks the energy or vibrancy of spontaneity.
Pasan los años y sigo llorando con i love you
I'm sorry but the Tiny Desk engineers doing the world a service and properly recording these amazing artists and letting them shine in all their raw musicality.... Can't thank you enough!
Thank you, thank you yoohhhh
NPR & YouTube knows how many views this is going to get because the ads every 5 seconds are CRAZYYYYY
Been waitin for this one 🙏🏼🙏🏼
❤❤❤
I know it smelled like sardines in there.
so little music and so much music, thats incedible !
I SCREAMED when I saw this omgggg
cuando ella baila, baila, se le ve, se le ve la minifalda ♪♫  oh no sorry, wrong tiny desk
A phenomenal quality that Billie ha is the fact that whenever she sings, she makes you feel the emotions she is singing about. That's a very rare thing and she is beyond talented.
Man I really don't understand how these tiny desks sound this good! 🔥
Billie is perfect 🩵I hope to see her live one day
LOVED IT
Billie and the guitarist behind Finneas were looking at each other a lot 👀
15:57 SHE DID THE NOTE CHANGE OMG. MY HEART STOPPED.

Her voice is always so beautiful❤️😭
This seems like your everyday elite school band
Billie looks so much like her mom as she gets older ❤
Thank you for waking up at 9:30
11:50 Wow, normally there are no cuts (at least, no noticeable ones) but this one was violent
oh my god get this rendition of birds of a feather on spotify RIGHT THIS MINUTE!!! the harmonies!!!
Best Version of "I love you" 😍
i need that high vocal on “birds of feather”😭 why she doesn’t sing like original one
CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY😛😛
From one Billie to another....... oh what a gift you have.  ❤
Billie heals the soul.

este fue mi regalo de navidad 🎄❤️
Meu deus que Tiny Desk maravilhoso! 🇧🇷
Se me pone la piel chinita
first doechii and now a billie tiny desk concert in the same week??? spectacular
“i’m dressed like a girl today” is such a vibe
I genuinely hate 99 percent of popular music but she’s so talented
Please do not receive sponsorships from Betterhelp, their platform is not suited for mental health care. There are many videos on youtube about this.
Bro tiny desk has been on an insane run everytime I'm scrolling through youtube i gotta take a second look like wait they got who?!
So goooood!!
omg her singing i love youuuu are u kidding me
I just love the calmness in her voice
I ❤ her voice and i love the duet with her brother ❤
Billie is such a good vocalist. Ah. Thanks.
your voice sounds amazing. just a touch stronger, with all the same beautiful tones as before
Saudade, Billie <3
too short, MORE
this was a treat
Ok next time can we make it 3 hours?
I love you Billie 🥹😍
This is so lovely to listen too while I work at my desk.
She needs to do an acoustic album. She and Finneas are GOATs. Their voices gave me chills!
the way finneas watches her sing has me in tears, sobbing, unable to breath
So pretty and emotional🏳‍🌈
Brilliant, simply what a great tiny.   I need to say than i was waiting the "high notes" in Birds.   Anyway, amazing. Love from Colombia.
Her singing I love you I’m crying
I screamed when I saw this video
i love her so much bro
Guitar in my right ear and vocals in the left, did they plan that
“I’ve always wanted to do this” yet you did it 4 years ago 🤷‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Please consider coming to SA next year Billie… therapeutic music ❤
The BEST Christmas gift ❤
They are, have been, continue to be .. en fuego!!
MY GOAT
First was Laufey, now Billie. Big applause to Tiny Desk! You are making me a big fan

PERFECTION❤️🥹!!!

never think i saw a calm version of the greatest
Good lord, the first note has my heart in pieces. This is going to be spectacular
WE LOVE BILLIE
Clairo styled her 😻
Really people are still doing "Better Help" sponsorships? It's common knowledge that their "therapists" do more harm then good
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGG <3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My life is whole now.
Tiny Desk needs to grab Gracie Abrams when she swings through the Northeast.
wow. beautifully done, they all fit so perfectly together.
I love billie so so much.
Chocada com a voz dela
Não acredito que a Billie foi🎉
💕💕💕💕
I love all of Billie eilish music and great she plays in that cosy place with that band. thanks for sharing. I am enjoing it fulle.greetings from Berlin
Where is the chilean flag??!
wow finneas rocking an orangewood, nice
❤
Everything's so well done, even the video description is beautifully written (as a Portuguese-speaking person that's a pretty accurate description of their performance 😄)
love the innate juxtaposition of billie’s voice w/ her general vibe <3
Billie!!! 😮😮😮
Love this gurrrrllk
my ears have been blessed.
we are so lucky to be alive at the same time as billie and finneas💙
Her music has gotten so stale and boring tbh...
COME THROUGH BILLE thanks for the concert of a lifetime this year
BOMBOCLAAAAAT
I love Billie Eilish & Finneas 🥺
i love you😢
im literally sobbing on the floor ily billie
POR QUE FUE TAN CORTOOOOO!!!!??
I love how Billie always proudly introduces Finneas as if the world doesn’t know they’re related ❤
actually first this time
i love you😢❤
Watching this I had a wet dream...imagin Billy, Aurora Nd Pomme singing life ...pfff. Anyways this is of course brilliant. Billy and Fineas it's always paradise for the senses!
WE NEED A CONCERT FROM ANGÈLE, LAURYN HILLS, CLAIRO THESE GREAT ARTISTS HAVE INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL FOR A CONCERT HERE, WAITING FOR THEM THROUGHOUT 2025 😊⚡️☺️
Dua Lipa has a better tiny desk than Billie 😅
No the ozempic got her
I love HER so much
The GREATEST artist of the new generation!
cant stop staring at chappells wig
Gosh! They sound amazing! Those voices blend like butter on hot bread
Listen to me we need Rosé's Tiny Desk pleeeease
Billie is the mahomes of pop music

Tiny Desk has become the MTV Unplugged of the 20s
shame they don’t last an hour! Congrats Tiny Desk
Queen Billie 👑
Beautiful!!
this is beyond beautiful.
For my sister Denise ❤
I can’t believe we got Billie and Chappell on tiny desk in the same year
i love you is one of my favorite songs ever what a beautiful performance
what a singer!!!!!!!
OMG OMG
watching here in the Philippines at 3 AM in the morning in the dark and nothing feels more perfect!
Is there a person getting a raise for this one?
La voz de Dios.
Brilliant. 🙂
One of my favorites😩… I mean it’s Billie and Finneas❤🔥
Omg! The greatest was insane!
this is amazing 💜
Very nice Billie and the band, thank you.
I could feel the nerves settle in for her at the beginning of birds of a feather, she goes back to her soft spoken-ness cuz the whole set has been that way when birds of a feather isn’t as soft as the rest. She settled nicely after the chorus, but id love to hear her belt that tune and get some more textured instrumentation for a proper live/acoustic version of this.
My God the way she sings……… live!
i looooooove you
Love her to death
billiieeeee finneassss 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
😭♥️
Garbage, can’t wait for them to pull funding.
Major respect for every artist who introduces the whole band 💌
Her voice is so gentle bro
Right where she belongs - how lucky are we to watch her artistry blossom in real time. See you in London 2025
CREEPY CREEPS MAKE MY SKIN CRAWL RIGHT OFF MY BODY
Eu só consigo pensar no trabalho que deve ser limpar essas pratileiras.
Finally!
lovely
beautiful Billie 🐰😻😻🥺
I don't get the hype. She has the weakest vocals out there. All she does is whisper every song. No strength or volume. This is why she is slowly fading. The era of whisper singing is gone. Thank God! Her brother should have been the star. He writes all of her songs and is 1000x better.
I can only think the trouble it is to clean up these shelves
literally got so many chills.
Chihiro or we (I) riot
Why am i crying?! 🥹
Amazing! if only she would sing Blue at least one time live, it will break the internet.
oh my god i love you.
loved this one! she reminds me so much of dakota johnson in this
Cryinggg, love this ❤❤
I’ll be here at least once a week to listen again, until something else inspiring shakes my core, or until I die, whichever comes first, thank you for this 🙏🏾
Once again thank you NPR and all Artsits!
Devo disser que me senti muito representado ao ler a descrição. Muito obrigado ao descrever esse palavra tão única do nosso Português de maneira tão criativa 😍
BILLIE ❤❤🎉
OMG SHE
spectacular
She's awesome!
The most beatiful voice that I ever heard! She's complete singer! Congrats
BEAUTIFUL
I run as far I can when I REALICE that ❤
Bobby Carter and ALL the Tiny Desk team for production team of the year, any genre, any art form 🌹
I’m cryingggg! 🥺😭 it’s sooo good!
how can two siblings be so GORGEOUS
❤
FREAKING OUT
This is huge
Where did tiny desk come from?  It reminds me of MTV Unplugged back in the day. How do you get to go to one of these?! How awesome!
yeah this ones going in the top 5, im calling it
Chad Michael Murray on guitar
te amo billie eilish
21:14 sooo gooddd 🫶🏼✨✨
Insane. Her talent is incomprehensible.
She deserves every grammy my god
💛💐
15:32 🇲🇽💙
Birds of a feather was a little off???
This was so soothing. ❤️❤️
Thank you for being this beautiful person. You give me hope and joy. My 17 yr old granddaughter saw you in concert a couple weeks ago. The best night of her life. You have helped her a lot. Her list for Christmas gifts from me ALL were from your merchant shop. She is even perfectly fine that they won't arrive until Feb 2025. I was able to get her the perfume from Amazon but all the clothes came from your shop. She is so excited as she knows I will get her items from you. She doesn't know what exactly but was very excited to know they will come directly from you..... Thank you for inspiring both her and my daughter, she is 22 but developmentally more like 10, she also loves you. I already received her items as she let me know early enough, like daily for months lol. Have a blessed life young lady you deserve all beautiful things life has to offer. You have been there for so may. Brother very talented as are your other instrumentalists.
She did the note change😭😭😭
Omg, her voice 😍 it’s my favorite tiny desk from now on
Billie vuelve a México por favor😭
Here before the million
It’s like suddenly everything is rigth and peaceful when Billie is singing
Omggggg respect to the pianisttt!!!!
chills the whole video omg
11:27 I love the way Finneas looks at Billie. As she’s telling her story, he doesn’t say a word. You can tell what a great big brother he is; he never wants to take away from her moment in any way. He’s just watching her with the pride of a big brother 🥲.
Oh, she is perfect.
My girl 🩷
I’m foaming from the mouth
te amo mamá
Clicked for Billie. Stayed for Finneas. 💛 (Both insanely talented)
Why is this fool “playing” guitar and we hear a loop??
her voice oh my god
Absolutely clicked faster than I have ever clicked b 4 ... inn myyy liffeee... needed this today.. TY NPR I truly appreciate you......
MY FAVORITE SIBLINGS

20:58 Me in my Car every Morning.
YES

Impossible to not fall in love with her, as a person, an artist, as everything. Billie is he most amazing artist that I’ve know. I’m so glad that I am alive at the same time as she is ❤️
Tiny desk when doechii  ☄️💥🔥 Tiny desk when billie  ❄️🌟🌈
guys you need to bring Aurora back pleaseee
I 'm so happy that this is finally out
i love you so much
the way finneas vocals add so much to it
Remember that dark era in Tiny Desk history when all they booked was Mumford & Sons look alike bands?
They did one during the pandemic but it was a cardboard backdrop of Tiny Desk. So glad they came back for another go. ❤
15:35 so beautifull
You are pure Joy Billie! Thank you for this beautiful performance ❤
K BELLOOOOOO
Oh my god
she's a pure angel
❤️‍🩹

Crying at work rn
OMG YASSSSSSSSSSSSS

Dl13a
Could you give a non industry plant like jpegmafia his own tinydesk
OMGGGG SHE'S PERFECT!!!!!!!!
Insane!!!!!!!
Gosh these commercials are killing my ears, trying to enjoy her quiet voice then BOOM💥
There's something so raw about her voice it literally draws every emotion out of you
Im speechless, billie's voice is so powerful 😭
OMGGGGG
15:25 they use to cry, but now they're laughing
someone can do a version without the applauses, so i can use this to sleep hehe
Is anyone else loooking for the little kitty that Chappel picked up?
OH MY GOD BILLIEEEEE❤❤❤❤

There are SO many amazing tiny desk concerts, This is easily in the top 5 best ever :) billie's raw vocals are ethereal. Her raw talent, range, and technical ability on her runs are just unmatched.
Es imposible escuchar a bilie y no llorar. De verdad que toca todas las fibras
There is no Way she is real
So pretty ❤️
She s art.
Te amo Billie 🩷🩷🩷
Gänsehaut pur   👍👍👍👍👍 Grüße aus Heisingen (Germany)
Sou a pessoa mais feliz do mundo por viver na mesma época que a maior artista da década vive ❤

Her soft and vulnerable voice is so powerful
So talented
That first note chills you know it's going te be a classic
A voz dela nos eleva a outra dimensão! Muito lindo esse canto!
This is beautiful music - gonna be coming back to this one for a long time, I think. Love how authentic Billie, Finneas and her band are & the genuine pride they have for each other  ❤
YO
So amazing
No cus Billie is the voice of our generation
Want more songs like " birds of a feather "
Teamo
BEERLY EYELASH
I HATE you Youtube ads!!!!!!!
El uniforme de la secu 🤍💙
this is my first time listening to billie eilish (voluntarily). she is really good.
WAW with the description of Tiny desk! I was thinking exactly the same, such a master piece... thank you so much!
Catriel y Paco > Billie
I’m bawling.
not the better help sponsorship 😭 they are quite possibly the last company to trust with such sensitive aspects of yourself as your mental health
Always masterful. I am enjoying watching this young talent grow . Who knows where she’ll be in 10 years?
Can we get this bird of a feather version on Spotify ❤❤
she sounds and looks so nervous but she gave the performance of a lifetime! billie the woman that you are
Amazing
I clicked on this video immediately. What a nice surprise to see a Billie Eilish Tiny Desk concert
Truly, Finneas needs no introduction, but I love how Billie always makes sure to formally introduce him.
Queen, you’re the greatest. Listening to you is like floating on a cloud ❤
I don’t understand what she’s saying a lot of times
Siempre he dudado de si esta mujer canta realmente
no bc you don’t understand how hard it is to keep your voice so controlled and quiet/soft!!!
Omg 🥹 Finally! 😍
É ELAAA ❤🇧🇷
THE GREATEST: 0:22 L'AMOUR DE MA VIE: 6:44 i love you: 11:52 BIRDS OF A FEATHER: 18:26
Great performance!
Chorando quando ela cantou i love you, ela sabe como mexer com a gente
MIS RESPETOS SRTA
Her vocal growth is astounding 😅
billie you are so beautiful i love you<333
Absolute perfection
I love her soooooooooo much ❤❤❤❤
🥹🩷
this healed me
That "the greatest" chill version is amazing 😥❤️
Am I the only one who doesn’t see the hype with Billie? Her songs are so slow and boring
YAYAYAYA OMG IVE BEEN WAITING FKR THIS AHHHH
Are we okay ?
Surprising that after all her megatours and success that she still is nervous before a performance such as this.
Billie (along with Finneas) is always fantastic, but I really want to shout out Solo Smith for his on-point bass playing which is a masterclass in restraint - building tension by not playing at the right times.  Love it.
I must admit I didn’t know much about billie elish maybe my age has something to do with it but she is really impressive! Thanks for allowing old me a little guilty pleasure 😂🎉 No offence intended
TRUMP FOREVER
Te amo Billie adoro tus canciones tu voz y toda tu 💚💚💚
como vas a cantar i love u DIOOOOOOOOS
Is anyone else absolutely freaking out right now ?
Those mics were MADE for Billies Voice ugh 😭🫠
She is quite literally one of the greatest artists of this generation, AND IS 23 YEARS OLD!!!
NOT just gon drop Billie Ellish on us.... OUT OF NOWHERE like this 😂😂😂❤❤❤ TINY DESK 🔥 🔥 🔥 ❤ yall man
felt like i was on a very soft cloud during the whole tiny, and for that thank u Billie
I was here
Whoa 🤯
COME TO BRASIL <3
Y'all had no business dropping Doechii and Billie's 🔥 sets just days apart 🤧🥵
Love the combination of Billie singing and Finneas doing the harmonies. These two really know how to harmonize. Always sounds best when the two are together. And I love the other musicians playing the song so lightly and breezy. Really nice.
she's so gorgeous I can't, also such a great performance🥺
Best that could have some, after Fujii Kaze
❤❤❤❤😢
And you and Finn did a Tiny Desk during covid. It was at home with a cardboard tiny desk backdrop.
her voice makes me feel shivers, this is absolutely amazing!
I didn’t want the video to ever end
Absolutely perfect!
We need Kali Uchis
billie singing lamour and ily was something special unexpected for me (i am deeply grateful for this surprise)
Love it!❤😊
Everytime i start listening to a tiny desk concert i can’t hold myself to listen to the concert from Mac Miller
She actually is the greatest 😭😭
Thank you Tiny Desk and Billie!!!
This is going to be one of the new Tiny Desk classics, something that truly hits you in the heart.
Beautiful Billie❤ you’re amazing
not singing wildflower is crazy but other than that,,, what the heck did i just watch omggggggg
I needed this so bad 🥹💙 this might be my favorite tiny desk performance ever
God i freaking love this experimental phase sm. I feel like I'm getting to know a whole new side of everyone's personalities and musicianship-- they had sm to bring. Not to mention just how much Billie and the gang exercise control in concerts b/c just listen to all the runs and riffs everyone's doing. It's a totally different kind of fun and play and it so nice to see all different sides of it.
I feel bad for the people who think Billie is just some sadgirl pop plant because they’re gonna miss out on this masterpiece (i don’t really feel bad)
Smart choice how she changed the beltings on the greatest. I guess in a small room it would sound so loud
billi te amo sos la mejor cantante, llenas mi corazon de esa magia tuya sos una genio, te amooooo
😭😭😭😭
doechii THEN her?????? were so blessed rn
Good music ;b
Que voz tan linda y que interpretación tan delicadamente sensacional! Admiro mucho a Billie por su talento fenomenal! Disfruté este Tiny Desk demasiado. Thank you Billie, thank you Tiny Desk! ;)
Out of time
this made my entire year
200k views in an hour 😭 I’m balling my eyes out at work, I will forever love you Billie ❤️
Billie is the singer people in 100 years will still talk about!
I haven't been a huge fan, but now I am!
Not gonna lie, I’ve never been a fan of Billie Eilish before. I’ve only been familiar with her more pop songs on mainstream media.   I somewhat feel ashamed that I’ve never heard songs like these from her till now. This is the type of music I can get behind ❤
Yaaaay!!!!! Thank you all involved!
So pretty!
She changed the note on I love you the way she changed it in one of her concerts 😭 she knew everyone loved it and changed it here 😭
I'm healed 🙏🤎
I wasn't prepared to hear "I love you"...
I was waiting for Chihiro but never mind I love you Billieeeeerrerrreeee
Better help on NPR!? 👎
We needed this so bad! ❤
This is absolutely beautiful 😭🫶🏼
A thousand thumbs down
te amo billie
Demasiadas emociones juntas, lloré y canté todas las canciones. Simplemente perfecto ❤
This is incredible 🔥💯
Gen-X guitarist/instructor/recording engineer setting the record straight. There's nothing worse about todays music than the wonderful music I grew up with that wasn't created by Capitalism and the Greed/Corruption it encourages. I don't like the production on most music today, it squeezes the life out the performances. As an engineer my duty is to capture the best performance & fix glaring mistakes, nothing more. Let the performers speak their truth.
"Advisory: This video contains explicit language" Got to love Billie being Billie 💙🖤
She is beauty
The goosebumps are crazy
Wooow!! Thank you 💜🎶
LOVE LOVE LOVE BILLIE
I love her voice then her brother and them together is like ❤❤❤ her in concert 💗 omg she was amazing!!!!! ❤
I saw Billie for the first time 2 years ago in Montreal at Osheaga and let me tell you she is one of the best performers I've ever seen! what an artist! Amazing performance from Billie, Finneas, and the Band!
Josh Newell, you have THE coolest job! 👏
I love you sound even better !!!!, ❤️‍🩹 I didn’t know how much I needed this master piece 🫶🏼
okay i’m not okay I LOVE YOU?
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
22:34. Majical

Such a super sweet super talented super authentic couple of siblings giving a stunning & moving performance! Thank you tiny desk!
Billie Eilish opened from a very unexpected side, and it was great. I've listened this gig with pleasure. Respect
te amo billieeeeeeeeee
What kind of dress code is that! Just like church people in 19th century, I really really like it.
great voice.. she has got talent. im fan of her.
HONEY WAKE UP NEW BILLIE TINY DESK JUST DROPPED
hard to separate the artist from the politics, especially when they call us names... too bad kinda liked Eilish
Perfeitaaaaa❤

I really love her spirit and aura on here. She seems so genuine and happy! A precious soul!!
I wanted them to play smth from don't smile at me😭😭😭😭💔
I feel like people forget that Billie is a 2x oscar winner
theres something so nostalgic about hearing billie and finneas' voices. the beginning of l'amour de ma vie reminds me of listening to billie back in middle school.
Ughhh Perfection 🤩🤩

Imagine a stripped live version of this album.
🥹🥹 noo lo puedo parar 🥲
Ok!! Get em Billie!!
❤❤❤ billie
I was bawling through the whole thing.
I’m with the first song and I’m already crying
I hope she gets albums of the year …more more awards please… I listened to the album from end to end for the first time this week driving to hospital monthly appointment and I could not help crying … I was completely overwhelmed by the tone of the album from start to finish and how one song built off one another… it makes total sense to hear it as one complete song.
This is lieve❤
marvelous!!
Hauntingly Beautiful! Incredible. I am shooketh! ❤  PS. The caption aptly describes Billie and this performance
esto es simplemente la mejor actuacion en vivo que vi en mucho tiempo
Ya'll can sleep on Billie if you want but her & her brother Phineas are sincere vocalists... her music has brought me to tears bc she's truly underrated💃💃💃
not bad ... for be the best I heard for a wile... super cheers
Here before this hit a 100 million views
Third time is the charm.
Come on gurlll!!!!!!! YESSSSS YESSSS im at work swaying and singing you ate this up mama!!!
meow meow meow meow
We waiting years for that Tiny Desks with Billie  Eilish ❤
TE AMO❤
She says she's not been sleeping well, but she looks fantastic💀
Finneas harmonizing😭😭
She’s the best! Her and Finn both. She killed it in San Jose
her voice sounds really different at some parts but always beautiful.
Tiny Desk is dead. Every show with some big name is a missed opportunity for independent musicians and up-and-comers. Billie Eilish doesn't need the platform and there's nothing special about the platform that provides a special opportunity to the viewer. She could make this happen at the Grammys, the Met Gala, Red Rocks, the Coliseum, the middle of the ocean on a floating stage.  Tiny Desk used to be something unique and wonderful. Besides that, practically essential to the Internet music scene. No longer. Just another stop on the PR circuit for the biggest musicians in the world... you almost couldn't get less bland and uninteresting.
Waited for this moment 😁
What a treat, showing us they are truly the real deal!
Loved it, but wildflower??????
Sua voz esta tao perfeita
Now I gotta go learn “ i love you” lyrics.   BRB
let’s gooo i was waiting for this one ❤❤
I LOVE YOU 😭
Finally lol
I RANNNNNNNNNN
te amo ❤
Billie, can you drop that Jazz album already please? 🥰
QUÉ
Wait who’s in the Audience? Is it the crew?
We are being robbed why is this so short, it ended while I was still enjoying 😢💔
Jonathan Creek on percussion 🖤
The way Finneas is looking at Billie while playing 🥹
I started tearing up 3 notes into the first song! WHEN I LOVE YOU CAME ON I SOBBED! I cannot believe she played I love you! 😭🫶🏼
She's the most beautiful singer I've ever heard, and both siblings make a team that's just... The greatest! ♥️
I LOVE U WAS A SHOCK I LOVE THAT SONG SM
Esto va a estallar 🔥 Billie es de lo mejor que tenemos actualmente ❤
love u Billie, pls come to Chile :c
just glad to be part of this generation
name a better artist. you can't. its impossible.
Not the ads playing in the middle of songs 💀
She was struggling a little with birds of a feather . I hope she’s doing okay .
IM BLESSEDDD
living proof that billie can actually sing
Kevin De Bruyne so good too
doechii and billie in the same week music girlies were are WINNING!!
No thanks lol. She chooses to use her influence to create division. Be better
This is so good
So much talent in one room!
The way Finneas looks at Billie at the "Im in your arms at central park" part is so cute.
i love you guitar remembered me the Corridors of Time from Chrono Trigger
The tiny desk is getting massive 🤯
She has scars right???
i hope she knows how many lives she has saved with her music.
El mejor del año sin duda, y eso que no soy fan 🥹👏
Thanks 🥹
I've been living under a rock for the past years and I  had never heard any songs from her but I am really enjoying it.
the note change in i love you UGH
Nice to see her dress like a grown up
i’ll never get tired of these tiny desk concerts
This is so nice ❤
their voices together are so comforting.
Nunca fui triste
I can't believe it omg❤
Yeeii!!! Here within the first hour!!
Que guria bem chata.
UM YES
❤love Billie till the day I die🤍🚀❤️‍🩹
I like her a lot
she’s so perfect
For sure my favorite Tiny Desk so far! I love her music and her voice ❤

Please, please, please bring MAJID JORDAN
❤Woah
all of these (now) 191,511 views are mine, i cant describe how much i love this.
NPR Tiny Desk sessions = (truly missed) MTV Unplugged
The mid performance ads are shameless.
INCREÍBLE NPR!!!!🎉❤ CONGRATS BILLIEEEEEEEE
ive been waiting for this
<3 stunning.
<3
Amazing performance. But the way the ads are placed in this video! Can’t even get thru an entire song without an ad
Spectacular gimme 14 of em rn

I CAN’T BELIEVE SHE SANG I LOVE YOUUUUUU I ALMOST CRIEDDDD😭😭😭♥️♥️ she hasn’t sang this song in a while🥺♥️
just the best tiny desk of the year! completly astonishing
I think Billie is yet no fully aware of how good "Birds of a Feather" is. It will definitely become one of those classic hits of music history. We witnessed the birth of an unicorn 🦄
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
That was too short.
Mi esposa
One of the best tiny desks! Up there with Mac Miller!
So cute Billie ♥ Finneas oh Finneas ♥♥ that sibling connection ♥♥♥
that was the most beautiful and authentic version of i love you i’ve ever heard
I love there relationship so much x
FINALLYYYYY
Te amooooooooooooo❤
Hey Billie, you probably won’t see this but be careful clearing your throat like you are. I know it feels good somehow temporarily but it actually slams your vocal cords against each other causing friction that can lead to losing your voice temporarily or just a scratchy feeling. I studied opera in college for a few years and this was one of the habits my coach had me stop and taught me about. Hope you’re drinking hella tea girl! You’re voice is so beautiful ✨✨✨
so happy to see this :’)
She was phenomenal on tour! We love you both! ❤❤ Billie and Finneas are soooo amazingly talented.
TinyDesk concerts give me so much joy.
Her vocal ability has gotten better and better over the years. So impressive to see her work on her craft to this extent.
FREE LUIGI
earlier i was watching her tiny desk concert from 2020 for the first time and today they released a new one? what a timing
MI CHINA BELLA

Billie and Finnies, thank you for your songs! ❤❤❤

I love how much you can hear Finneas!!

❤❤❤❤❤❤
Her brother wants to steal the show plus he gives abuser vibes just saying hahah
The description with the portuguese word "Saudade" fits perfectly! Amazing performance, Tiny Desks are truly the best! :)
Please Tyler The Creator 💯🙏💯🙏💯🙏💯
21:18 is heavenly
I guess Billie is tired [she doesn't blurt out the TILL THE DAY THAT I DIEEEE

Sin desmerecer a la gran artista que es Billie Eilish pero bastante malo y aburrido su tiny desk, creo que podría haber agregado mas de su energía musical y onda para que quedara mejor!!! no me gusto para nada. Vengan de a uno ;)
ON MY BIRTHDAY?!?!?
Finneas voice compliments hers so well
15:59 omg she did the note change again
💙
Im not hating but Finneas has to chill on the "Harmonies," its really doing a disservice to the performance
This couldn't be more perfect. Just a lovely tiny concert!!!! Such a blessing!  Thanks for this masterpiece. ❤❤❤❤
Her voice is absolute heaven
she really is the greatest
You left me at the Tiny Desk wanting more 👑❤️🎵🎼🎶
Fantastic, well done 🎉
My birthday is coming soon, I was born on the same day as her, December 18, we are so similar!!
Screamingggg seeing this on my YouTube

Aww I’m so lucky to get to see this so early !❤️
This is going to break the internet
So... crying while I'm having breakfast it'll be

Just saw her in concert a week ago and then this dropped! I’m fed with live performances rn
GURL WHERES WILDFLOWER?????
why billies band all dudes, super disappointing
Who is this girl, and why is she sitting in Paco Amoroso's chair?
Great vocalist and great songs. She surely has a great future ahead of her. I love how NPR helps bring these new young musicians to the big audiences. ❤
loviu Billieeee
Love you guys ❤
tiny desk has been cooking recently
THANK YOU FOR THIS 🖤
she's so beautiful
There's something about the way she pours her soul into every big note, her facial expressions are pure magic! And those little heartfelt comments between songs? They make her even more lovable and so incredibly genuine.
This just cured my depression
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😌✨️✨️
This is the performance she was talking about in the new interview!
So Beautiful 💆‍♂️
Simply amazing.
I love this version more than the studio and tour one cause we can see both of them singing together and clearly hear their voices as there is no  background sound of fans shouting✨🤧❣️ I know this video is gonna be a hit ❣️
I love the fact that as a 55 year old man I can still find beautiful new music to enjoy ❤
She’s so cute.
When they sing together is everything
I hope one day I can meet her and thank her for what she's done for my life❤❤
Love this ❤
this version of boaf is amazing.

Perfección ✨️ absoluta ❤
Billie I just found this video posted one hour after release.  Sounds good looks good. Thanks
She' seems so lovely, humble, and is wickedly talented. Absolute life slayer.
No wayyy
Love it. Good set list, I was initially hoping for Wildflower (my fav from the new Album) but without the backup singers that one is hard.
^©^
meteram saudade no meio pra q?.....
I love you Billie!
Imagine when she picked up that water at the beginning, it was sparkling water and nobody told her.
Her voice keeps getting better. But still has held that hauntingly beautiful quality. ❤
Tiny Desk RULES! So many cool gigs over the years, known, unknown, simply said you guys rock!!  Thank you!
I needed this today.

Maybe the best live vocal I’ve heard.

William Eyelash in the flesh. It's not my cup of tea, but enjoy :)

She was made for TD.  One of the best......for sure.  Only criticism of TD is too short, would love an hour.

Pra fechar o ano bem, esperei muito por isso!
Ughhh this is tiny desk just healed me
Broke the net with this one
Soooo jazzy..i might not be over it
omggg a week ago i thought: billie should do a new tiny desk mann 🥹🥹🥹🥹 and here they are . i love how intimate tiny desk is, it suits this performance and billie (&finneas) her voice so well 🤍
*slaps*
Gorgeous! Thank you for the fabulous performance!
Clicked soooo fast when I saw this!
minha linda, que orgulho deles todos ❤
This is going to rule my life now thank you tiny desk
I’m so happy whattt 😭😭😭😭

mds como eu amo ela
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Thank you TDC! Thanks Billie!
I’m so obsessed with how well their voices compliment each other. Plus how much they admire each other🥹😭
Entre más la escucho más me obsesiono con ella 😅
I LOVE YOU ?????????? oh no, no no no no i am not ??? going to be ok
she’s actually angelic
I would've hoped for a more upbeat setlist 😴😴
Soooo beautiful
The soft voice is so powerful!!!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Here before 1M views I LOVE YOU BILLIE N FINNEAS
I love it when they spotlight one of these new up and comers......
THIS IS AMAZING 😭
I have never clicked on a video so fastt😭😭
BILLIE + FINNEAS = DYNAMIC DUO
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL…
She’s so good
They're like the modern day Carpenters! It's so cool.
When I tell you I was so shook that she did THE GREATEST, ANDDDD I LOVE YOU? We’ve been fed greatly this year
This is The Greatest Tiny Desk
She sounds great. Tiny desk separates the real from the fake pop stars IMHO. Bizarre seeing her in business casual attire, like she is going to do data entry at the tiny desk when she is done with the show.
THANK YOU  never clicked on a video so quickly
She singing birds of a feather after i love you like that fear of loving she had is rotten away dead and buried 😭😭😭😭
😱😱🫀
Did not expect to become a fan of Billie Eilish one day. Well, so much for expectations.
please get Mustafa!
every time billie and finneas performs, it’s always so so special. they’ve just got that spark that a lot of artists these days don’t have. i love them and their music so much, and i’m so happy they got to perform together on tiny desk 🥹💗💗
Thank you tiny desk this was a great performance!!
The “I love you” NOTE CHANGEEEEE YESS
The second song toched my soul men oh god

Viewer 144,385 ❤
Beautiful and mesmerising. I love that there doesn't seem to be much post production, just leaving Billie's and Finneas's voices to capture the songs in a raw and moving way.
Masterclass in dynamics!👏👏👏
Angelll
I love you Billie ❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
the most beautiful voice ever
des larmes et des larmes et des larmes et des….
❤👸🏼💎🌌🦚🦋🌻

Incredible
Aye YO the Amy vibes on "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE" are immaculate
turned up the volume and still couldn't hear anything.
💚
meus maiores amores, e os melhores
Thank you NPR and Billie 😊 It's already 3am here and still can't sleep so I'll just watch this instead 😂
AGUANTE BOCAAAA
Speechless ❤
Her voice makes me cry
Absolutely BEAUTIFUL. I’m so grateful for their existence and them doing another Tiny Desk👏🏾👏🏾
oh my god her hair is so long 😭😭
Omg so amazing! Billie is the greatest ❤️
I LOVEEEEE ITTT
They did a tiny desk a few years ago? Why she say she's always wanted to do it?
She’s awesome, Finneas too!
I'm really moved. Sat here in silence, enjoying <3 Finneas and Billy are beautiful together! And their band is great too. Yes, I know it's Billie Eilish, but this suits better in my opinion.
Absolute chills!!! I loved this so much!! I love them together!
Love me some Billie
PRECIOSO MOMENTO GRANDES MÚSICOS  BILLIE ESPECIAL COMO SIEMPRE  (y me encanta su camisa)  ❤❤❤❤❤ Love you Billie
You are The GREATEST!  what an amazing performance, FULL of emotions and feelings. Just perfect harmony between Billie & Finneas and the acoustic band just completed. Thank you NPR.
Ugh I’m so obsessed with her voice & her herself🤍 i love my girl
I YELLED SO LOUD ITS 2AM OH MY GOD
İkimizin şarkısıydı 8 sene önce ilk birlikte dinlemiştik..🌹Sen şimdi sessiz dinle çocukların uyanır..:(
Horrible 😤 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤑🤮🤑🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤑🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤕
i think i just witnessed my favorite video of this year
WE NEED TATE MCRAE ON HERE 🗣️🗣️🗣️
I don't think people understand what they're watching.... her singing is so difficult to replicate!!
Thank you billie and finneas. Merry Christmas 🫶🏻🎅🏻
Shes a real artist who doesnt buy her awards and force her success to others and not obssessed to be on the center of attraction and attention and dates famous celebs to be talked about and write songs about them to play the vicitm
💙
Doechii and billie at the same week is crazy actually
Necesitaba esto para terminar bien el año, ella es mágica 12/12 Gracias!
This made me cry in the first 2 minutes
COMO QUE ELA CONSEGUE MELHORAR ALGO QUE JÁ É PERFEITO????
"i look like a girl today" 😭😭

YA PÓNGANLO EN SPOTIFY
CANTA TAN HERMOSO COMO SIEMPRE.
I luv Taylor swift
Her VOICE!!!!!!

Is it normal if I cried after she sang I love you? 😭😭
She's here too...
✨💖✨🌊🌀🎶✌🏼🫶🏼🙏🏼🦋❄️
This is beautiful😍😍
God I arrived an hour late but it's so good to see Billie doing well, she sings so well ❤️❤️
Nice guitara playing

This is really beatifull ❤❤
when she sang i love you i was crying and like after that i literally started to dance 😭😭

THE ABSOLUTE CHILLS THAT PERFORMANCE OF “THE GREATEST” AND “I LOVE YOU” GAVE ME-
OMG! That was the best tiny desk concert yet!
here before a million
Clean
GIRL, giiiiirrŕrrlllll, girl.gurl
Yes!!!!!!
😍
Love this billie x pewdiepie collab
Hearing billie singing i love you is not for the weak
Im impressed how the tiny desks have grown, it might be the essence of bringing artists to small venues to show their music in a more intimare way
Juro que la amo demasiado.
under 24 hours
Profundo, delicado, sem palavras, te amo Billie!
I love Billie she will always be in my heart, thank you for this little Christmas gift ❤️❤️
16:00 THE NOTE THE NOTE ahh

her voice is so angelic, i love it
❤❤❤
dude i literally love her sm
Why the band have the same hair lol
I was hoping she’d sing chihiro 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
i love that she's also so excited
Es un ángel.

I cried when she sang I love you ❤️ she is the best voice of your generation ❤
Tems first Then Doechii Now Billie🥺🥺😢✨
Please, come to Brasil
I love how they compliment each other, they’re so talented❤️
So insanely proud of you Billie.
canta lindo y todo pero es tan fome
Here!
YOOOO I did not realize just how much I NEEDED a Billie Tiny Desk Concert today
feels like the theme of npr's bg is inspired by the idea of - MORE is LESS!
THIS GIRL PULLED THE ILY CARD IM UNWELL
Billie’s keeps reminding me of Corrine Bailey Rae. They do similar things with their voice. Love both of them! 😍
I love Billie Eilish.
I need to fix something. It’s clearly not working out .
FINNEAS IS MY FAVOURITE! Also FINNEAS: "Tiny Desk Concert" WAITING
Ameeeeeei o final diferente ❤❤
no wildflower is criminal
This is stunningly gorgeous, jazzy, soulful, and tugs at my heartstrings❤❤❤
❤❤
2024 was an amazing year for Tiny Desk, but this one is in the running to be the BEST one of the year.
Remember all them clowns saying she needs autotune? They went into hiding😂
I need this tiny desk visual framed on my wall
Finally 🫶🏽
i love her but they sound so messy ☠️ maybe it's bc she really was nervous but still even the band sounds off
o controle vocal da billie é insano, que consciência do instrumento que ela tem! maravilhosa
The new MTV Umplugged ❤️
qgenia
YOOOOOOOO
She ate this
11:52 OMG I WAS NOT READY 😢❤
aquí antes del millón
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
NON WAY!!! she is too hot to be the Billy Eillish!!   must be some dance group girl with the same name! lol
This happened today ❤🎉
It feels like she’s sitting here in my room with me and singing 🥺🫶🏼✨
Bless the i love note change
oh billie
I love her so muchh
Doechii raised the bar so high that they had to bring in Billie Eilish
Here we are at a tiny desk. Thank you and bless you all 🫂
❤
🔥🤞🏼
Such an amazing performance. The best tiny desk concert!
Matter of fact play this whole thing at my funeral pls and thank you
"Every breath is so full of indulgent melancholy, hopeful regret, at 22 years old she's become a captivating fixture of what it means, or rather what it feels, to love and lose simultaneously." This is it
Best lunch break I’ve ever spent
She said all black people leave but you!
como pode ser a maior
No creo que exista algo mas perfecto que ella
This is lovely of course, but I really wish YouTube would stop showing me ads in the middle of songs...
im shaking guyssssss😭😭🥺🥺
absolutely need these versions on spotify
This just made me crave for her jazzy songs 🤤
She’s so beautiful
qué cosa TAN ABURRIDA, caray
Billie te amo mas que mi vieja
This will be the most viewed Tiny Desk mark my words
😭😭😭😭😭😭
such talent, first time listening live… wow!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Feel like they missed something wild🤔
Ads in the middle of this masterpiece should be a CRIMEEE
13:51 😭😭😭

the most anticipated singer 😊
YES I LOVE YOU
Since no one would: 00:20 The Greatest 06:43 L’Amour De Ma Vie 11:52 I Love You 18:26 Birds Of A Feather
Goosebumps and just one minute in!
Its like a reward
If you don't make this into a vinyl record istg. I NEED THIS.
stopped everything to bring out my bose headphones instead of my earbuds during finals week in the library jst to listen to this, honestly finals week tweaking rn but this makes this week a bit better
i cantttttt her voice is just AHHHHHHH
I’m always surprised by how far she sings from her mic ! Does someone know if their is a specific reason ? Anyway, this was amazing
I love her so bad ❤️
please please please do next with Sabrina carpenter!
I adore the facial expressions both Billie and Finneas have when they sing. What a fantastic performers.
Billie: the best of all today and for a long time
She should have started w Birds of the Feather lets be honest
SAUDADE ❤️🇧🇷
I've waited my whole life for this. 22 minutes is not enough
each song brought me chills and tears with the unreal instrumentation and vocals. I love you so much billie
I was supposed to be working rn… but when I saw this pop up I knew I was just gonna be behind, her voice is especially insane to hear when it’s acoustic 😭💗
4:21 oof chills, I love music
why cant these be longer!?
YAY
pq y'a Epektaze au piano ?
🤩🤩🤩
As crazy as our World is..we still have amazingly beautiful experiences like this…thank you.❤
Much love from India!
Amazing but these ads are interrupting the best parts of the song.
I love the way this tracklist was put together
Hearing I love you is quite the treat
This is THE GREATEST tiny desk performance in history! ❤❤❤ it will go down in the history books! ❤❤❤ Billie eilish is the best singer in this entire universe and here is proof ❤❤❤❤

2024 Tiny Desk has to be their best lineups
I LOVE YOU??????????????????????????? FERAL
Como me haces llorar hdp te amo
I done sat here and listened to it more than once 🔥❤
Tiny Desk brings out the best in everyone who comes on. Im not typically a fan but I love the stripped down sound and you get to hear the talent and skill of the musicians.
That girl can SANG
Very awesome! 👏🏻
Love billie so much her music helped me so much throughout life. The good and bad times she's so memorable and created so many memories for me. Followed her since 2019 in rehab and she's blossoming now rightfully so. Love you Billie
Cuzzin B does not miss!
oh and now i’m crying
Você é incrível
Get DOECHII views up on tiny desk
unintentionally early but so glad i was early for this one
all this without in ears, shows you how connected and in sync they are
Maybe 2024 wasnt so bad
ONE (1) album without this man please just one 😭
I love the way finneas looks at Billie when she sings❤
Girl, don't feel sorry for your soft voice. You are not quiet, and this is one of the things your fans fell in love with—both you and your art. Forever and ever. This Tiny Desk session was amazing.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER 18:28
These guys are getting better and better
Catriel y Paco > Billie
I will not allow myself to die until I hear her sing Chirohiro live.
😭😭😭 I’ve been watching from the morning
this is pure art <3
I love you, marry me !!!
That was pretty great, I took my headphones off at one point so I missed a couple songs but everything I heard was wonderful 5 stars would Billie ellishes again
I ❤ their HARMONIES! I’d love to hear an album with more Finn, like this. It could be a slide side-in project that is maybe under a different name to separate the dynamics  (think: Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds/Grinderman or PJ HARVEY/PJ HARVEY & JOHN PARISH). Also, someday PLEASE DO A FULL ORCHESTRATION/BIG BAND Swing Era/Ballads (New & some old)…I KNOW WHEN IT’s time, you can fill ANOTHER GREAT BILLIE’s shoes. I SEE YOU. You too Fin…orchestra stick?  Wish I still huffed cases for the local Seattle/Tacoma Arena shows, it would have been a delight to help CREW your show! aGenX request & a 🪭 of your 🪄🎁🎼🎸🎤🎹📖🎶〰️🎵🎶❣️ Thank you for sharing your CREATIVE AUTHENTICITY, BEAUTY, PLAY, & JOY! We NEED MORE of THAT EVERYDAY 24:55 . It’s beautiful & rough times.  Blessings & safe travel. May you both get to take a breath in nature in between- even if it is a Dusk to Dawn lifestyle ;-) -élan Miashon
I loved every second of this!!
Like this if you’re here from 2030
No WILDFLOWER? 🤯🤯
It's been a privilege to watch her grow up and mature since Ocean Eyes. Her career has taken her from being a great young singer to a fantastic singer, songwriter, and performer. We are so lucky to witness this and I can't wait to see and hear more from her.
I don't tend to listen to one song on many multiple repeats but this is one of those very few couple of times (almost all triggered by tiny desk)..
👍
that was one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had.
que hermoso show !!
LOVE!
Love you so so so much billie🩷🩷🩷
cant believe im living in the same universe with THE billie eilish
I'M HERE
i LOVED THIS SO MUCH
BEST way to end the year we got this and finally a new vanity fair on her BDAYYY like omg
Очень круто🆒 нежно, приятно и искренне! Tiny Desk - ❤
Billie's vocal is like a warm breeze that flows through the whole area. Its delicate but full and free.
She sang I LOVE YOUUUUUU
The best npr ive ever listened
in awe of billie, in all ways
Fck, la más agradecida del condado. ⚘️
Melhor canal de música
she keeps getting better
Finneas deserves an episode
I honestly dont know how this girl is famous. She is absolutely the most overrated artist I've ever listened to. I don't get it. I understood Brittney, she was atleast hot even though she couldn't sing a lick. And I understood Adele she could sing even though she wasn't nothing to look at. This girl is neither.
slay
What an amazing description Tiny Desk gave us. I do speak Portuguese and I'm from Brazil. The word "saudade" is indeed what many songs bring us. It is the most beautiful meaning in Portuguese, yet no word has ever been this close in English. But this video comes close. This is a message to all the non-portuguese-speakers there: saudade is exaclty what Billie pictured here. Hope you all have a great day and a greater 2025.
I love yall so much billie and finneas❤
Am I hallucinating or is she drinking sparkling water?😂
I’m eating this
16:01 that note change will always for it for me😮‍💨❤️
Doesn’t matter if you think she has nepotism, that she wins too many awards, nothing matters because her talent along with finneas is real no matter how they got it. They deserve it so angelic
so insanely talented, so nice to hear her sing i love you again definitely heals something inside me even though it’s such a soul crushing song lol. one of my favorite songs as well love you so much billie! thank you for what you do and sharing you’re beautiful self with us. 🤍
She played I love you, my life is complete
Absolutamente apaixonado por essa mulher
FINALLY❤❤❤
El mejor regalo de cumple 😞❤️‍🩹💐
Holy vocals
Finalmente Deus ouviu minhas preces 🙌
Nice one ❤
Obsessed
I LOVE YOU, BILLIE!
Some great musicians in this band, and some FANTASTIC hair
It’s giving 1,000,000,000 aura no cap! Also not me clicking for Finneas
Billiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie <3
i dont know why but i cried this touched me deeply. i love billie and finneas and their art so much it hurts
I LOVE YOU. Ur joking
🐐
Her brother is ALWAYS in brother mode. You can see it in all of his facials. ❤❤❤

truly a once in a lifetime duo, these two create absolute magic.
melting
Su voz ❤
These ads have the worst timing. At least play in between songs.
she is so cute and has such a special voice. we could have used her in the coffee shops of the early 2000's lol
Billie's vocals will always be my favourite
ily billie <3
Ô MULHER TLENTOSA JESUS AMADO, UNICO DEFEITO É NAO VIR PRO BRASIL

Posted 58 minutes ago the way I clicked SOOOO FASST
I just love Billie Eilish sooooo much, Im so happy about this video<3
Which one is the "meow meow meow" song?
Man she's too good, I listen to her casually since 2019 and I can tell how much she's evolved as an artist as a vocalist.. proud of her, hope she wins a lot of grammys this year!!
musical geniuses
TE AMOOOO
la voz más hermosa del planeta
Beautiful 🤩💕
I could and would listen to her forever
I'm sad this video had to end :(
She’s so pretty I’m crying 😭😭😭

This is absolutely gorgeous 🫶🏻🥺
I need every version of these songs on Apple Music by yesterday, thank you
I can’t believe we get to experience this 😭
beautiful voice wow
FINALLLLLYYYY
Hi Billie, this is Nani. Me and all the other old guys were talking: would be cool to see a Casablancas collab sometime. Just a thought.
Beautiful performance, thoroughly enjoyed this one and doechi’s
Keep singing little bird...Like you were created to do
this is the closest I will get to an actual billie concert
shes so soft i hope she’s alright
Finn is so underrated, that man is a genius!
The people at MTV should be ashamed. NPR is eating their lunch
YES. Last time I saw them on this channel they were using a cardboard that imitated the actual background, because of the pandemic, remember?
BILLIE FEEDS US FOR CHRISTMASSSSSSSS
TE AMO BILLIE
wow i’m so early
FINNEAS my religion 💜
oh my god billie you have the voice of an angel
Im so happy for this❤
the note holdddddd on ily oh myy
OMG!!!!
it’s crazy she’s made it so far
This would have been more enjoyable if there weren't youtube ads in the middle of it multiple times...
que hermoso es ser fan de esta mujer❤
When was this tiny desk concert recorded?
How does one get into the audience for these? -she asks a little too late
0:33 - THE GREATEST 6:45 - L'AMOUR DE MA VIE 11:53 - i love you (THE BEST PERFORMANCE...HANDS DOWWWNNNNNN) 18:26 - BIRDS OF A FEATHER  Y'all are welcome 😁😁😁😁
t amo bili ailish
Wow! Wow omg that was wow!
Russel Wilson is Mr unlimited

Better help sponsor come on guys 🤦🏻‍♂️
The greatest note change bro🥹

Lo-fi Hit Me Hard and Soft would go so hard 😩
IF I EVEN WAS?????
I like the high-school band aesthetic.
divou
A Christmas miracle🥹❤️
NEEDED THIS
FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING
Not to be picky,  but it should have been billed as Billie Eilish and Finneas. She's not the only major headliner, singer and songwriter here.
The only time I’ve ever listened to her is on NPR… now I’m a fan, Thank you Billie, thank you Bob.
Ahhhhhhh so good
17:18 bOyfrIENd im NerVous
Te amo Billie Eilish 🎇
OH MY GOD YESSSSS THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER

4 of my absolute favorite songs by Billie and Finneas, I'm so happy they picked these ones!
I LOVE YOU IS MY FSVORITE BILLIE’S SONGS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
❤
Billie & Finneas + Tiny Desk = Medicine.   Nothing better than a Billie & Finneas acoustic performance. Their talent & originality are ageless. Her voice continues to grow and I love watching this development.
I love how it sounds like the tiny desk has a huge audience in that tiny room. Like where do they keep them??
The dynamic duo!!!!!!❤
I can’t handle the way she went from I love you to boaf 😭😭
Well I had plans at work today.
Yesss😍😍
Ily
how rude of YT to put ads while i was enjoying this😔😭
I feel it in my soul 🥹
Level 99

OMG
Her music is going to inspire my RnB project,

Am I the only one that did not want finneas singing in this? no hate (I love and listen to his own songs)  just was looking forward to raw billie vocals and the best parts seem to have him harmonizing

incredible artist. The best of her generation
I was never particularly curious to listen to it, but as it is from TDC, I gave it a chance. They always do a good job.

Thank you Tiny Desk for this brilliant experience to hear one of my favourite artist on your little stage 😍 Hope for Avril Lavigne in the Future ❤

Brasil in the House 🇧🇷🇧🇷
How long til this gets to 10 million views?
can't believe youtube hid this from me for 41 minutes
i just love that im getting my daily billie eilish content
She uses her voice as an instrument, what a true musician!
the arrangement on the greatest is the most beautiful thing i’ve ever heard omg
2024 has been all about Hit Me Hard and Soft for me.  My number 1 album.  Also, NPR... Madonna literally has a song titled 'Saudade' that was released in 2019.
Billie + Tiny desk = Perfection ❤❤❤
I LOVE YOU BILLIE, YOU SAVED MY LIFE💗
Didnt she make one of these before??
Nah....
Muñeca linda
I LOVE YOU?are u serious 😭😭
It looks funny how Billie stands in front of these colorful and chaotic shelves in her simple outfit. <3
ARTISTA
What an emotive and dynamic performance. This is why they make the big bucks.
6:25 The bottle shift! Indeed so cool!
npr you have once again saved my life😔
absolutely obsessed with how finneas' vocals compliment billie's so beautifully
How is this so beautiful🥺🤍
I just got my tooth pulled but I'm  singing through the pain 😭😭
My favorites 🫠🩷
That change she she said if I even was instead of if I ever was is sooooo good
Finneas. So good❤
My only complaint is that it isn’t longer lol

I LOVE U BILLIE SOO MCUH
I still don’t know how she is even real, what an amazing voice/ overall person 🥹
This felt like discovering a new artist
Sad that trumps people want to end NPR entirely they think it’s woke propaganda
this year has been insane for her
This version of “the greatest” sounds gorgeous, i love it
NO WAYYYYY
give the audio engineers for these recordings all the accolades.  such clarity, richness and emotion always captured in these videos.  KUDOS!
Starting this masterpiece performance with a better help ad is crazy.
I need the uncompressed version of this plsss ._.
ew
perfection
we get both billie and finneas? We're all winners.
Tiny Desk should be renamed to Grand Desk ❤️🎶🎼🎵

Not even a week since Doechii's tiny desk and now we have Billie?!?! This is too much give me a break
The big brother energy of Finneas in the room is so present, you can tell she looks at him and stay as close as she can to him for safety, and Finneas looks at her to say ; don't worry you are doing amazing, i'm with you little sis it's so cute. He's so protective over her , it is so obvious
❤Beautiful my queen I love you so much;3
this is the best christmas gift ever
billie is the sun for finneas
oh my god i was so not ready for her tiny desk
Billie and the Long-Haired Men™
Music that puts me into sleeping
THE GREATEST in just her head voice was unbelievable 😱👏🏾
I am so happy that this happend at the end of the year, I just want to thank billie for her music!
like my comment and manifest for a better day
😍😍😍
Finally. That’s all I have to say.
Drummer taking the best 💩 of his life 4:24

The greatest was so beautiful
well yeah

Billie and finneas i really love your art!
Her voice is beauty.
L’AMOUR DE MA VIE is peak
Thank you for bringing the best Talent on Tiny Desk.
The I love you vocal shift change gets me every time 🥰
tiny desk concert my hero
Again! Tiny Desk’s audio engineer bringing the perfect clarity to every aspect of the music 👏🙌
Her talent is unmatched. People who say she "whisper sings" have zero knowledge of vocals. It is SO hard to sing this way. It takes much more control compared to belting out your vocals.
The drummer at 4:24 taking the greatest poop 💩 of his life.
Man I Love her!!! 😍😍😍  She was singing the first sentence and I had goose flashes immediately!
why are they dress up like a church band?
I LOVE YOU?!?!
So so good! S2

Morrendo sério.
28 MIN AGOOO
Tiny Desk confirms who has talent and who doesn't.  Billie Eilish has talent.
A gorgeous album, so stripped bear. Billie looks younger, more vulnerable and real  now than ever, it's as though we're getting our first sights of the True Billie. Beautiful ❤
Me: getting emotional because she sings “I love you” 🥹 Billie: 15:21 oUUouuuhhh *chuckles* 😂
Tiny desk Billie is EVERYTHING🥹
19:24 i’m dressed like a girl 19:27😂😂😂😂
so short! :(
😢😢😢😢
We're ending the year on a high note with these beautiful Tiny Desk Concerts.
She is quite simply a beautiful voice of her generation.  The collaborations with her and her brother, Finneas, are extraordinary.  They write songs way beyond their years.  I can't wait to see what the future holds.
As melhores versões da Billie são as acusticas❤
She is so nervous ! So cute🥹❤️
This was everything. (And i did in fact cry:)
とってもナチュラルでとっても素敵でした✨✨✨ 衣装もかわいい！🫶 素敵な時間をありがとう😌🙏✨
insannneee😍😍😍
I pray she releases a vinyl version of this like mac did.
she left us a hint when making the note change in MSG omg
One of the best Tiny Desk performances of the year, if not THE best! Fantastic job.
best artist of the 2020's
I like
I've been waiting for this for a long time 💗❤️‍🩹

And wildflower ?

Expected Better Health ads to start scrolling across the bottom. Song selections were all downers until the obligatory current hit. Her voice is unparalleled but this set and performance was meh for me.

“i’m gonna go girl today” is so real 😭😭😭😭😭

BEST TINY DESK (It's not out yet)
It's cool to see them actually at the office this time. I was really impressed by how realistic the first tiny desk was, even though I believe everything was just a print of what the background looked like.  Super excited. Get more returning artists, Megg the Stallion has my vote. Honor Mac with more hip hop for sure 💚
I fear she’s preparing us for a new release 🧍🏽‍♀️
