MU is the laughing-stock
Semenyooo 0:07
Evanilson . Is the one that INJURED HALAAND WITH A MASSIVE rough challenge.. for a stupid throw in.. He played very rough all first half .  SO HE CAME at speed 🚄.. how in HELL WAS HE GOING TO STOP
so he gets it rescinded becuase he slipped.... when clearly john duran slipped in the newcastle game and they wouldnt rescind it. load of bollocks
Come on Cherries great team with great players .There is still hope to play European competition. Love to see the players on the pitch and EVANILSON red card to be reverse if we manage to a point against arsenal and Manchester city surely we will be able to boost European hopes. Up the Cherries, great fan from the Gambia. arsenal 1-3 AFC Bournemouth. the only problem Bournemouth is facing is VAR decisions that cost us dropping valuable points great manager "Andoni Iraola"
That red card decision was gross incompetence
Ruben is the right man ❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who cares if he slipped, a two footed tackle is a two footed tackle regardless. It's like saying if the keeper slipped outside the box with ball in his hand is that a penalty?? Of course it will be!
Kinda vibing with this one. #**g o l d 8 8 8!**
You can defend Evanilson for the red card, fine, since it was a slip. But plenty of players had been sent off for slipping as well (Bruno against Spurs, Dorgu against Ipswich). Also, Tyler Adams was lucky to be on the pitch early in the first half. Game would have been much different.
Ez
Manchester must find a great goalkeeper
VAR contrversy and you don't show Tyler Adams... tint tinpot club
If it wasn't for that redcard Bournemouth would have scored 2 or 3 goals. Feel sorry for Evanildon, slipped and made a dangerous tackle.
Looks like an accident rather than a red card offence REFEREE IS AN IDIOT !
Ismét 10 ember (mint a Lyon) ellen örülni kellene a döntetlennek???  ...amit az utolsó utáni percben lőtt a MU. SZÉGYEN! Menjenek dolgozni a sóbányába!!! Ez itt nem manager kérdés. A játékosok szándékosan nem fociznak.
if that foul had been made by, keane or scholes it wouldn't have been debated, straight red, if rice tapping the ball away, a ball that was kicked at him is a red then that tackle ????
Onana is very poor on keeping the ball, why Amori don't know what he's doing,can you change formation if it's not working for you...... Next season we be worse than dis one u like bring the whole of Barca team to Man united under Amori them we still can't win two  stringh games....... That's her poor Amori is
Kinda 🎲 vibing with this one. #**g o l d 8 8 8**
Забарному на фронтт
Glory glory glory Man united
Mu bapul
andai saja dr dulu ada VAR tidak mungkin MU punya trophy sebanyak itu.
Yeah not only that the two rugby tackles on Maguire in the box, that somehow were not given as penalties, neither one of them 🤯
The only thing controversial is u should been down to 9 not 10
as a red I`m tellin` you - it was a red :))
I love how red dog Man U kids come crying in other team channel
controversy? lol
Seriously? Check VAR? 100% red card
The Tarkovski tackle was way worse and no red
metade do gol foi do Evanilson 🇧🇷🇭🇺
Red card first half then manchester united scored at 96th minute which means if the game stopped at normal 90minutes these stuggies of humans could have gone home beaten by 9 men . And you claim to have a club of football !! it's a shock fans of united open your eyes and your dead brains this club will never make you happy any day soon . Stop wasting your money to go watch a club with no future .
Bruno Fernandez 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😡😡
Red card saved
We almost had a controversy where Dorgu got the ball, got kicked by the Bournemouth player who was late on the tackle, picked up a yellow despite the fact that he was the one fouled, and Outtara almost scored the freekick....
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Semenyo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally he scored a tapping
Onana was clueless
O.6XG vs 2.7XG, all these massively over performing team will get spanked nexr season.
Var controversy really?? Should be ashamed of a team that mouthbreather coach of yours has made, get a grip ffs.
Kungfu vs Manchester united
Nah Bournemouth, come on. You are a lot of person's 2nd or 3rd team. Don't disappoint us with this "controversial" rubbish. Everybody saw it was red. Tyler was orange, so we won't argue on that one. We have a paper thin squad and those were awful tackles.
Controversial your ass, see Bruno tackles on Maddison, bruno didnt mean it and slipped, but still red card, how this controversial? Clear a RED! And that Adams to Garnacho too need RED, fcking referee
As a Man U fan  The first tackle was a red  The second was a yellow ,he slipped surely var should show the ref there’s nothing he could do about it  Give him a yellow and tell him the only reason I didn’t give you a red was because it was beyond your control
Grassmus celebrating so shameless get him out of my club
That GK gotta go 😂... Red card it's not just his left foot it's also his right foot and that's not a slip thats basic science when go in like that natural forces of your left leg hitting the ground its always going  move forward if his leg is further back more then likely doing the same thing  backwards and if his leg never moved probably would have broken it.. Danny Murphy so funny bless him
What controversy? It was a red card all day. And the United player was lucky his foot was off the ground when the studs connected, else it would have been much worse
Gloryyyy
So... we all saw the guy slipped on a replay. Fair enough if he sends him off and there is no var.. mistake by the ref... but when you have replays and still make the mistake.. just get rid of VAR.. we are sick of it.. I'm sick of it
Unfortunately Evanilsons slip ended up in a bad tackle that had to be booked with red. I wish that would have never happened, cause 11 vs 11, Man Utd had no chance to gain a point out of this game
Neither of those are red cards - United fans moaning again
How’s that a red card when when the Brentford two footed scissor tackle on Martinelli was a yellow.  Best league in the world with the worst referees?
What's Hodjlund celebrating??? Cos I don't get!! Celebrating equalizing against a 10men Bournemouth and Manchester United still rooted at 14th position? What a joke 😅
Refs and VAR officials are bought and paid for, we all know that.
Oopps Semenyo ❤
Please when will hojland score a normal goal
Controversy ? Come on buddy. Have some shame.
lol Mu need help by ref to take a draw imagen...how hard their fans look this, meaning bournemoth have high level than MU.
ManU sucked
Controversy my feet! you deserved 2 red cards!.
Evalison 3 match ban for slipping over? Is that football or officials making it how they want every year you know deep down bournemouth have had the most discesions against them this season and this is more truths
Slipped, not red
Onana dived OVER the ball...😮😮
Evanelson clearly slipped
"Evanilson is the second player from Fortaleza, the capital of the remote state of Ceará in northern Brazil, to play in the Premier League — a region that rarely exports players abroad."
United is so lucky again
Wow!! I wouldn't be surprised if manchester united finished 17th or 16th place this season.🤣
Great highlights. Is there any reason it only shows Bournemouth  chances and not for example Garnachos chances.
Rubbish team Manchester United
It wasnt controversal, he didnt even try to tuck his studs in even if he slipped.
Semenyo 🇬🇭
No one is even talking about semenyo
Whatever, we didn't keep the winso down we go in the depths of the bottom 10. Effort wasted.
The thing is you can slip when you are engrossed on the ball but that player lifted both his feet while slipping to intentionally tackle Mazraoui's ankle. Nothing "controversy" or controversial about the red card decision when that player is trying to intentionally hurt someone while slipping. Let's be real, Bournemouth played very aggressive this game and there should have been 2 red cards.
I saw two red cards,the ref is a joke absolutely a joke.
w the hell is this controversial llol
Flat foot defense and toothless attack from Manchester United
🇬🇭🌍
Shocking var decision for the red.... Typical scum result. Deserved fck all
My relationship with your mom is controversial.
Didnt show the first red card huh, bums
There was another tackle that deserved red...
Controversy😭💔💔
Never a red card in a million years, refs and var still showing they are getting worse week in week out. Yet again Man Utd seem to steal point/s they don't deserve.
Højlund trash lol celebrating a point
Should have been 2 reds the admin can sod off
OK onana needs to be sold asap
Whoever that's saying that wasn't a red card is not human. You wanted him to first break his leg and then say yes, it was a red card.
You really didnt have to make the "H" on the thumbnail that wide lol
That shouldn't have been a red, these officials lack  common sense
Kepa saves Bournemouth
Only thing controversial was that Tyler Adams wasn't sent off for that crazy challenge earlier on Garnacho.
👍
Harsh red card
That free kick nearly give Onana a concussion from that post.😅😅😅😅
that was a yellow card
Lacking creativity . Why not play Brooks?  One shot on goal????!!!   Not good enough.
Man utd is in a very poor form but teams are always considering playing with them being challenge and this is the reason why. They will always surprise 😂😂
I hope you lot are relegated next season. Absolute god awful camera angle.
HA! That’s what you get for the 0-3! We just denied you European football! 😂  Also embarrassing that you parked the bus against us and you let our worst ever striker score against you at your OWN GROUND!
Bournemouth's camera angle is appalling. Can't y'all build a tower and get the wide camera up there?   What a terrible camera angle!
Bournemouth Is So Underrated Football Club In England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Excellent Save From Kepa Arrizabalaga + Goal From Antonie Semenyo + Red Card From Evanilson.   AFC Bournemouth Shared Points (Draw) Againts Manchester United In The Vitality Stadium  Score By 1-1.
