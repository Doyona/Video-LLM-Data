i used to not like science till grade 6th last year and i wld score bad also it was boring for me but this year in grade 7th , i got a teacher who teaches so well , is really kind , understands me , helps me , motivates me and now science is my favourite subject , my answers have improved and i finally understand science and i dont know if she will teach me ever again but she is that teacher who i can gladly call " the best teacher in the entire world " for me....i wish that every child who faces similiar issues is taught by her or another teacher who can give them the same love and guidance which this teacher is giving to me.... and i feel so fortunate to be amongs those people in the world who got a chance to be taught by her.......  Thanks Ma'am for your guidance , support and help, You don't know this but without all this I was nothing ...... You are the best teacher i ever got and will get in all my lives , and im grateful to you , words or anything is tooooo less to tell how much i owe to you , The chance i am taught by you next session is not known but even if u don't teach me again still i wldn't owe someone anything more than i owe to you, if i grow up and earn a name then the credit will go to u "  I hope someday you see this message and maybe find out who I am
Hi my name is chhavi to..❤
Ty for this video UwU
I’m a furry UwU
Just loved the way she called the student to check if he knows the solution. Otherwise our teachers straight away cut marks.
I had one such wonderful teacher when I was in middle school. It had been just 2 years since I met her and she left my school. I really wish she taught me more and I could spend more classrs with her
i hv one teacher like this, my maths mam no matter how much we asked doubts even very stupid ones she still answered patiently and wasnt too strict
I wish we all deserved teachers like her<3😽✨💖
Vese mai apni tarif to nhi krna cahti😂😂, bt I'm glad to know ki Mai same Aisi hi teacher hu❤❤
P = pass
Imaginary
Unpopular opinion, while most students seem happy going to the ground, I would have hated it. I always preferred staying in class and hated subjects where I had to move my butt to a different class or lab and definitely hated Physical Education.
Being Kind is not wrong
please part 2  vote for part 2
Our english teacher were like this in 10th
Maam I am weak in science, need tuition.
Saadhika Syal is a splendid actress.She looks perfect in whatever role she does
Hello
This video really touched my heart ❤
I wish every student could find a teacher like her ❤
2:15 By seeing this moment, I am missing my favourite teacher too much 🥰 Class 6th mein unhone bhi mere marks bdhaye the...😊
We have this kind of teacher in school
If we have teachers like this then toh full on mastiii!!!!
I wish I had that kinda guide in my life
0:33 lekin maths Mein To Sirf 14 chapter hai hai
❤❤❤❤
I had a teacher like her in my previous school, but I miss her now because my father changed my school😢
I also want teacher like you❤😊
but the sad thing is that those teachers face students failure because the student take the teacher lightly
This types of teachers don't actually exist in our educational institutions
Teacher in Parallel word
In really the teacher we all get is just opposite 😅. Mere school me to bs top 10 students ko appriciate kiya jaata ek baar ek exam me mera rank 12 aa gya tha top 10 ke list se bahar. Teacher ne bahut sunaya.aur jab bhi mai class me kuch baat krta tha to jab teacher mere ko dekh lete the to bolte the ki next exam me tumhare rank niche jyega aur baat karo😅 jina muskil kr diya tha mera😅
I can proudly say that we literally have 2 teachers like her , we are glad ❤
Aisa teacher agar hota na toh ham sab students ke L nahi lage hote
nyc
I have that teacher 😊😊😊
That Harsh guy is a damn amazing actor, he should be playing a lead role with filter copy.
in dreams it can be, in reality 😂 😂
My class teacher is like that ❤
I am a teacher and I am of  this type
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best teacher ❤
WE NEED this teachers
We have such a teachee in our college   she is my favorite teacher 😊
Koi inko meri teacher banodo pls pls pls ,i swear meri regular attendance rahegi yaar❤❤✌️✌️🤡🤡
The fact that she is a maths teacher
My Mam ❤️
Aisi teacher mil jaati to life sorted nhi ho jaati😅
1:21 teacher is looking like Madhuri Dixit ❤
Seriously we need teachers like this who can understand students...wish I also had these kind of teachers...
Kon kon 1 may 2025 3:50 pm ko dekh raha hai
Do if class monitor could hear ur thoughts
Dream 😂😂😂
The one who is playing the role of the teacher is really a very good actor and performing every scene so gracefully tbh and Harsh acting is also good .
Yar hmare bhi teacher ase hote
Maths mein learn nahi karte
But slowly students starting disrespecting these kind of teachers
Nice teacher
I also want teacher like this
I wish I had a teacher like her 😢
0:34 hi nahi hai
All other things are fine but I don't support revealing chapter wise weightage for exams to such extent. A little amount of stress is necessary for overall development at such a ripe age. Only then they'll be confident while facing hurdles in future.
There was a teacher in my school  sharma teach nothing useful
The teacher i need - Jeetu bhaiya❤😊
Deserving Teachers are Only for Deserving Students 👍🤗🤓
We all need these type of teachers especially me!!!!!
The teacher is looking like madhuri dixit😂😂😂😂😅
I am a teacher. I wanted to be like this. But this education system make me mad. Ye sub mark ke peeche chal the he
Instead of nurturing the innocence inside the kid , education system destroys it just bcoz of ego and some stupid inhumane rules. This video really shows what’s needed to be done. Appreciate it ❤
I like it this video
Man ki bat
ek second maths me kya learn krna hota h 🤔🤔
Aise teachers only found on filter copy videos
School me bun bana kar kaun jata hai bhaiii...😅
I wish my tenth grade teachers were like her 😢 she is amazing
madhur in mathura  je kuch bhi chod ke aane kaa mann naa kare  ,   madhur in mathura je kuch bhi chod ke aane kaa mann naa kare  ,   aisi teacher mil jaaye toh kabhi school chod ke aane kaa mann naa kare............ ❤❤❤
The teacher we deserve ❌️ Teacher in parallel universe ✔️
we want such a teacher
ha bhai aesi hi ma'am chahiye .
I have one my English teacher . I have been studying to him scence I was in 4th grade and now I am gonna pass out 12 th grade soon ❤❤

Teachers in parallel universe 😂

True but hard to find in this generation 🙏

Teachers in parallel universe 💀
2:18 I’m sorry but since when was there a “P” as a grade???? 💀💀😭😭
This literally reminded me of my sst teacher
Mere madam to kud chup ke ka lete hai 😂😂
That's my zoology and botany teachers to me. One is the homeland and the other is the godfather. ❤
No one can take the place of virat kohli
I'm very happy that I have also have the same teacher ❤
Such teachers are not supported by the school administration. Sadly aisa teacher hamesha nikala jata hai school se😢
Many came here after Seeing Reel of Quadratic Equation😂😂Harsh
The teachers we wish we would have pov in India your dream won't come true
IN MY FORTH GRADE I HAVE A MAM I HAVE MOST RESPECT AND ADMIRED WHERE ON THOSE DAYS I WILL NOT SPEND MY TIME MUCH WITH FRIENDS AND I WILL STUDY LIKE A GHOST THEN THIS MAM WHO SUPPORTED ME IN EVERY MATTERS FROM SMALL MATTER TO BIG MATTER ONE DAY MY MAM WHERE GOING TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL DUE TO PERSONEL ISSUE AND I MOVE TOWARDS MAM AND MAM TOLD THAT "YOU SHOULD SPEND AND ENJOY YOU LIFE EACH AND EVERY MOMENT AND MAKE OTHERS HAPPY" LIKEWISE MAM TOLD I HAD TEARS IN MY EYES AND SEND OFF MY MAM NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT MAM IS BUT IF I GET A CHANCE TO MEET MY MAM I WILL TELL EACH AND EVERY MOMENT I HAVE ENJOYED AND THE IMPACT THAT CREATED IN MY LIFE .

unknowingly stundents falls in love with these kind of teachers❤❤
Goosebumps occured while watching the last clip of the video
Your videos are very short try to make it with little bit more duration
Mai bhi esi teacher deserve karti hu 😢
Most of the teachers want to be like this .... but then students start to take them for granted.... thats why they become strict in variuos cases.... being a science teacher I too started like this but then I have to change myself to survive in classrooms and get some better results.
I like this teacher as playing the role of the teacher
I was lucky that I got a teacher like her in 10th🥲🥲but then I changed my school and now I am living in absolute hell😔
I'm glad I had a teacher like that. Now when I saw this scene 1:41, I still remember her giving me a chance to write an answer for one question in Biology and today I'm a Biotechnologist 🌟💫  I still remember her. And her name is Shindhe ma'am. ❤️
I am so pleased to tell you that I have this type of teachers in our school ☺️☺️☺️
This type of teachers are very rare to find but by the grace of god the class teacher of my class is soo good. Like he so strict but also frank type of but when it comes to study you can ask any  doubt you have.Also I am introvert so I cant ask doubts he is helping me to ask doubts
Im so happy because there are teachers like me as in this video.😊.treat kids with kindness and love... Use negative reinforcement as punishment.thats my way f tchng.
I am so lucky that i have really a teacher like this my most favorite teacher she is more good then teacher in video my role model my hero queen of biology Poonam ma'am
Teacher da real name ki aa??
SMALL BUT AFFECTING INCIDENT WE ALL CAN RELATE TO ---      I don't know why , whenever a student fall sleep in class either they punish them or send them out of the class. Feeling sleepy is not in our control even if we try so hard not to. Feeling sleepy tells us that our body need some rest. I don't know why they don't understand. Giving them punishment make them feel  embarrassed in front of like 40 -45 student .😢  I WISH I HAVE A UNDERSTANDING TEACHER IN MY SCHOOL ❤
1:11 TRIANGLES IS SKIPPED? SO LUCKY GUYS
1:07 tf is important about Arithmetic Progressions 💀
0:56  that book only has 14 chapters tho
Me after seeing my teacher's toxic behavior
3:30 need this type of teacher who supports sports also and see true potential
i feel students also must be sincere to deserve such teachers
She is good teacher but my math school teacher is also good but not like her
Good actor acted well❤
She is not the teacher we deserve ... This is how the behaviour of a true teacher would be ....
I hv the exact teacher 😊
I wish that type of education system exists here
This is something we all wish to have but it is not possible such teachers are one in 10 eternitys
Finding those teachers is like finding a diamond in the rune of stones  And.. If you ever want to be a teacher be like her
can I have this teacher PLSSSSS PLSSSS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I do have this kind of teacher ( Divya mam). So lucky to have her in my life..❤
Probably many of us had this kind of teacher but class ki shor aur sharaaratein itni thi ke teacher tolerate karke thak jaate hai😢😢
Asi teacher to hm b deserve krte h😢
Chp 6 is toooooooooo imppppppppppppppp😂😂😂😂😂 in real
As teacher mila to samjhe jo ki bhagwan mil gaya
underrated , part 100 v aya to dekhunga
We wouldn't get this type of teacher's 😢
Next virat is shubman
Reminds me of my maths teacher miss kanwal 6 standard to 9 standard she was always with me I still miss her
She has a Madhuri ki smile❤❤
I am lucky that i had a teacher like her in my school, her name is shital kale mam.❤
Teachers areeee justttt greattttt🤌🤌😭😭🤧  In our school we have a teacher just likee herrr 🤧❤️
Aise teachers India me to nhi milenge baaki desh pradesh ka pta nhi😂😂
Us bacche ke hath par tatoo kaise  1 57
I have a teacher like this
Apart from last scene, it was all stupid and nonsense. You mean Teacher who allows eating during class, passes student even on failure, does not give punishment  and homework at all is teacher what we want. Very Good! You want teacher who pampers you. It is true that today's education system sucks but don't ruin the value and morals of teacher.
I had a teacher like her ❤
😀😀😀
Getting blank in exams was for me alsso during my class 10th
: )
My math teacher is like this. Very happy.❤❤😊😊
I have this type of teacher
Tammanah's smile on her face . so cute !!!!!!
She has taken mathematics and said to learn it
But students halke me lene lgte hn unse accha se behave kro to I am a research scholar, i am very lean nd thin, meri exam me duty thi bed k maine har students ko sab kuch explain kiya unse polity baat kiya n all and mere sath ek aur invigilator the he was also a research scholar aur wo sbko ekdm dannt daant k bol rhe the bina reason k v  Suddenly one of the girl asked me to solve mcq i told her that this is not allowed then she said aap teacher nhi lgti hn, aap hi hn kya , mai to as a friend aapko solve krne bol rhi thi , par sir se to bolne ka himmat nhi h and i was shocked..
Why I'm crying 😭😭😭❤
The teachers we never had
Hamare Yaha to teacher bss : "KATORA LE KAR BHIK MAGOGE".
bhai meri mam bhi aisi hai
Madhuri Dixit😂❤
Laura... Bache kitne mc hote hai malum nahi comment section ko.. ache teachers bhi ro dete hai akele mai. They feel humiliated due to students disrespect
That Dad has one of the finest haircuts man!
I have this... 😊
Our math teacher is just like this.. She is so nice to everyone. My respect and love for her cannot be explained.. Hope everyone gets this kind of teachers... and students, in returns, must reciprocate their teachers' kindness.
Meanwhile Boarding school: Sab log Be like=  Mera teacher to har din test kara ke Fail hua to hamare pair ki jutyi nikalke pair me Lakdi se peetta hai 😢😢

I got 97 in maths because I missed 3 mark question and when I requested my ma'am to give benefit of doubt then she denied.
aisi teacher mujhe kabhi kyu   nai mili ya uss sirf hamare he time per aise teachers ki manufacturing nai hoti thi 🙂🙂🥲🥲🥲🙃
Teacher in parallel universe 😂😂
I have this type of teacher
This is what I like about being a teacher.  There is so much good we can do for kuds😊
I have got a teacher like this.. and she is the dam sweet teacher.. who supports me like this.. thank you Shanmuga priya mam🥰
If I would be a teacher I would definitely be like her
The tiltle should be "Teacher in Parralel Universe"
🙏
We don’t deserve this kind of teacher 😂😂😂😂😅
Reminded me of my class 9 Class teacher who happened to be a Maths teacher as well….obviously she wasn’t this perfect but still this reminded me of her ….bhot jaldi school khatam hogaya bhai😢
Saadhika Di looks like Madhuri dixit
Asa teachers ise planet per tho milna muskil h khaas kar India mai tho bilkul naah 😂
She is not a teacher, she is Goddess 😭❤
The last part 😊👏❤️‍🩹🔥
I have like teacher
Yes those type of teachers we deserve but didn't get😢
Ary pta h school m toh ase teacher usually ate nhi aur jo ate h unko ye school bale nikl dete h
The dream of all the students 🙌
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I also want a teacher like this
Yar ke kitne auesome hai😂😂😂😂
Aisi teacher ke liye mein apni dono kidniya bechne ko tayyar hun, milti kaha hein yeh bata do 😭😭😭
Wow🥹❤❤
I’ve had this kind of teacher, I loved her, she was so sweet, best teacher of my life
My 7th grade teacher was just like this she made us mark all of the important questions she left the school this year we all miss her
Ever since physical punishment has become a thing of the past, students lost decorum. There are several cases of students flipping off a teacher in class. Inappropriately talking in online courses. Students like them dont deserve anything lol
Teacher ho to Aisa 😂😂
It's  my 6th class class teacher  She is like an angel she never scolded/beats us she always give us pen on teacher's day children's day and the last day of semister on the last day we all pranked our teacher with an empty box then we give her a mug and a sketch of her then the whole class made a group hug and i cried now she left the school  The name of that angel is :- Mrs. Pooja Mamajan ❤❤❤❤❤ We al loves ,misses her very much
esi teacher me mujhe meri Ma dikhai deti he.  is duniya ke har guru ke charano me naman
Nothing is possible in school 😢
I used to have a teacher just like this ❤❤ but sadly she shifted away❤❤ All good teachers shift and bad teacher stay💔💔❤️‍🩹
the teacher we never got
I had good teachers, except for my Science and Maths teacher. But some teachers are special.
The teacher we all deserve but can never have😂😂
1:48  I swear this is necessary and I'm not talking about her increasing his marks. I'm talking about the her way of calling the student and making sure that he is not struggling.
I'm a lecturer and my student sent me this saying ''It's you ma'am"!🥹❤️
Damn we have a teacher who's exactly the same she's so good I can't explain ma'am help us with everything just so like this vdo
aisa sirf sapno me hi ho sakta hai
kash esa hota mere sath mere teacher to mujhe hate kerte hai
Kisi Ko pyar Karta hai❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ram Na kisi Ko pyar Karta
ASI TEACHER HAMA KYU NAHI LAGI
Class 10th ka ncert maths book
I have the same teacher
Ok yessss! That parent teacher meeting scene is like MY DREAM! Please get us all teachers like that because if my teachers understood me, life would’ve been so much easier bro
According to me....we do not deserve such amazing teachers(any teacher in that matter)but in the true reality...the teacher's don't deserve us😔😔
But the textbook which you are holding has 15 chapters, then from where did the other 3 chapters come??…😅😅
Waw ❤❤😢
but who learn math
1.32 ...so happy khushi😊
True  This represents the outstanding property of a teacher. Teacher is not the one who only give lectures but teacher is the one who recognises actual potential of students and encourages them. I also had my Math teacher like this she was filled with motivation and knowledge, and I always thank her for my math because whatever I know today in math is just because of her.😢
I have taught nursery, primary, secondary, and now university students I have all the qualities except asking for lunch but students always share with me their lunch also ask me too
aase teacher sabko mila 🥰
Too good to be true 😢
Plus part 2
Class 10th maths book my favorite
2:05 the teacher we all need ❤
i have
We have a teacher like her☺️☺️
My name is also Khushi 😊
I have a teacher in my school . She didnt taught me but she was my brother  Class incharge . From there i got to know her .. over the time we became like friends . She is such a nice teacher i have ever imagined.  I wish she could have taught me . She is very frank with children.
Its actually like my economics teacher he helped us by taking good real life examples also he's more like  elder brother to me as he help me alot in economics since i am weak in the subject....
amazing I saw reflection of some my teachers 😇🥰
The title should be 'The teacher we all want' 😃
I had a class teacher like this when I was in 8th. I have recently passed the class and miss her soo much. I mean that class was the most special class, we have the most beautiful memories of that class. I miss that teacher soo much❤❤
Like I'm still in school and we have a teacher just like her in our school.... She teaches mass communication and you won't believe me when I say that all the students of my class are ready to write a note to the principal to you know make her our teacher in the upcoming year..... The child who barely passes other subjects has scored the highest in hers..... I myself messaged her one night before the exams and she didn't even hesitate a bit to help us out.... And fun fact almost all students follow her of other social medias and she sends us relatable memes lol... I  am a person who doesn't care about others life but I have found myself wishing for the well being for her...... She is really nice!! I wish she gets the best in life🤧
I GOT THEM IN REAL❤
My Italian teacher is like her !
At 0:33 she says the students to learn 18 chapters but the text book consists only 14 chapters
I am glad that I had this type of teacher in my life
We can't find this type of teacher in Nepal they are literally cheap,not understanding us they just know how to make us feel low🔪
We can't find this type of teacher in Nepal they are literally cheap,not understanding us they just know how to make us feel low🔪
I have teacher like this of maths
I have found these qualities in different teachera
Teachers are worthless 💀
truee
I’m in 8th class and sadly don’t have a teacher like her.
I love she teacher❤
Heart touching
This is a myth.
These type of teachers are there in fiction only. Not in real life
uk we had this kind of teacher and moreover she was also our maths teacher....gonna miss her sooo sooo sooo much🥰🥰🥰🥰
I wish every teacher was like her some days ago I went to my school for taking my registration copy and my class teacher was behaving so rudely with me in fact every teacher of my school behaves rudely with the students this world needs more teachers like her
All this characters are fictional  And none of them apply in real world
Actually we have a teacher like her and she is our maths teacher and also science sir
Wow
It's really our science teacher  .😅😅😅😅
You are giving Swades movie's gita vibes <3
FC main Emotional ho gya 😭😭😘😘.
Yes we can
I miss soumyodipta ma'am so much after watching this... she's now out of the country...but definitely was exactly this teacher. And blessed were we to have such a teacher ❤ who made our perception for teachers completely change...love you ma'am...also miss you a lot❤❤
Ma'am I also have one teacher like you and I really feel blessed to have her 😊
Chancey? Daughter of Blissey?
Teacher in parallel universe 🤣🤣🤣
Parallel world
Ma'am to hamare Class teacher jaise hai bhai
PART 2
trust me you don't want teachers like that with students like me, I would fall for them at the first interaction #notkidding.
Aise teachers bilkul nahi hone chahiye. Aane waali generations sathiya gayi hai and bina unko bajaye seekhenge nahi. Strict hona hi padhega. Students aise teachers ko granted lene lagte hai. In the end, jo strict hote hai, they only nurture your discipline, and they are the ones we remember in the long run.
In our school it's Heema teacher.. We just love her
Seriously guys belive me my biology teacher is like her ...her name is akansha ❤❤❤
Hamare school mai teacher agar student-pro hote hai , to unhe nikaal dete hai school se. Principal ko bhi nikal diya aur keh diya"personal reasons"
Thank you teacher…..Anuradha madam and Sarada Madam…..🎉🎉🎉😊
Never in this generation 😢
She is the best.l want her as my teacher
well, I had a teacher like that! she used to teach us literature, the most amazing teacher that I ever had in my life. She had been the one with whom I was able to skill up myself in the best version!!
Our teacher is like that
i actually loved the ptm scene so much, like my heart melted
My Principal who teaches us English is more or less like this. This was like a blend of all the best qualities of my teachers. I feel so privileged to be studying under them. Love my teachers ❤ And will definitely cherish this relationship with them for lifetime 😊
id recognize that math textbook anywhere
Thank god we find really really good teacher in pakistan
I can proudly say that I have teachers like her, and I'm blessed! Thank you for everything, teachers.
We literally have the same teacher she is really sweet, friendly,cute and everything I just love her💗
I feel very proud to say that I have one such teacher....and I respect her a lot.... Thanks mam
Teacher we deserve- Ms sadhika syal Teacher we got- Babli ji😂😂
FRIENDS IT MY REAL LIFE INCIDENT ----> WHEN I WAS IN MY P3 KVS SCHOOL MY MARKS WAS AROUND 69% BUT WHEN I CAME TO MY SURAJPUR KVS SCHOOL MY MARK INCREASED BY 86% JUST BECAUSE OF MY NEW SCHOOL TEACHER  MY PT-3 EXAM MARKS WAS(Surajpur Kvs) MATH-36 SST-38 SCIENCE -39 HINDI-35 ENGLISH-30 Pt-1 marks(P3 Kvs) English -30 Math-29 Hindi-34 Science -29 Sst 25  Love my new school they are best ❤
The male students in my class don't deserve this type of teacher
but we have our maths teacher Sourav sir, who gives us us a second chance to score well in the exam! 😄
The reactions of everybody, if a topper scores just 5 percet less in her boards. Over hopes on her, pressure, goals. Why can't studies be a fun? Why can't we enjoy it?😢  School wants only good results but not to give good education 😞
ek aisi teacher to me bhi desrve karta hu 🙃🙃
did she really say to ommit triangles chapter in maths she is the best teacher
She's not teacher she's angel 😇
https://youtube.com/@lovelydreams.2.0?si=pRcmH9itM_1uwhe3
Maths teacher woh bhi itni acchi hamari maths teacher toh kisi Manjulika se Kam nhi 😂
I have a chill mam 🤣 just like that
The title should be "teachers in parallel universe"😂😂
I hope we will see teachers like them in our future if we can! edit:and some people should be like that instead of being like a angry bird.who agrees?
The tittle should be teachers in the parallel world.   the saddest truth of life or school life is that your capability is just based on what percentage , what grade or what marks he or she gets  one  can see the efforts
i hve got the best teacher like seriously she is now my best friend and i share everything with her and even we hang out ❤ BLESSED TO HAVE HER 💎💕 she means everything to me and after my class 12 still we share the same bond 🥹💕
In parallel world 😢😢😢😢
I want to be teacher  like her in future to support them and encourage them  Hope so I will achieve my dream ❤❤🧿🧿
This is soo relatable, Missing my School Teacher.
i can see my both chem and cs mam in the last openday wala scene,even tho they shout at us in the cls they r vv caring i realized it after my scl got over i love my chemistry mam !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
teacher looks like madhuri dixit
Not all of us deserve
4:07 not for permanent but at least for this part i wish i had her as my teacher
Except the exam parts, she is just like my geography teacher.
Btw there is only 14 chapters in maths textbook of class 10 lol
Aisi teacher ho to education and discipline ka bedagarg ho jaaye
Who thinks that the teacher is helpful
I have already deserved this teacher in my life
The teacher in parallel world.🥺
...but didn't have! 🙂
Ironically my math teacher is just like her, but he isn't our class teacher. Also, I can totally relate to the point of going to ground rather than study in a arrangement period (even if exams are over our heads).
She's like our math teacher:)))
This is sooooo damn accurate bcuz in my 11th and 12 th my maths teacher was the same and this is exactly how he treated us more than our class teacher we would be cheering for him if he had won any award ❤❤
How naturally she act♥️♥️
Okay! So shayad tumhe jalan ho 😏 meri Hindi wali mam bohot achi hai humse hasi mazak bhi karti hai aur free period bhi deti hai! PTM mei complaint bhi nhi krti.. English wali mam Hume saare questions bata deti hai important and usi mei se aata hai question paper banke.. maths wli mam lunch karne deti hai class mei 😂 sabse supportive Geo/Eco wali mam hai..
My surname is also Bakshi.
My class teacher was exactly the same, but unfortunately we only got one year with him the other students are so lucky to have him for more time also most of the teachers in my school were like this
But in reality we end up with a teacher you calls you character less just because you made a ponytail coz your second rubber band was with the girl who lost her rubber band 👍🏻
The Teacher We Have : 😮
Don't say we want this teacher say we will become the best teacher
As a harsh I can say, MUJHE Kyu Toda, I never failed in school 😕
Most of my teachers were good but some were having to irritative personality The best teacher my 8 std class teacher she used to say i have good voice she saw great skill in me which i didn't notice untill she said ... That was first time someone's complimented for my skills at that year i was main singer of the choir for awareness song 😊 that was such an amazing memories in introvert school life 😢
I'll start my career with teaching! I love the way students love their teachers. I'm a student of grade 8 & the love i provide to my teachers is unconditional. And in return i gt more n more by them. I just love all of my teachers❤. They are Gems!. In conclusion, i would be a great tchr for my students,will be a mentor & therapist for them. In last i'll love them infinity❤
So grateful to actually have a teacher like this 😭🫶🏻
Already in love with this Teacher character of Saadhika Sayal..
Impossible to have such a teacher in real life .
teacher in parallel universe 🤣🤣
guys give a pause @1:37 and we have our filter copy madhuri dixit,what say
Its really hard to find such a teacher like that.But we all want a teacher like that❤
also the students a teacher deserves , this is also required , bcoz respect of teacher is degrading
aisi maam milna sapna hi reha gaya par dekh ke samj aagya why we deserve maam and sir like this
Really wish the teaching profession were good paid 🥲 if it was people who dreamt of being a good teacher wont get into IT or some other sectors for good packages , wish this profession got recognition it deserves
Parallel universe me hota hoga aisa
She is our teacher❌ She is our 2nd parent✅
my chem teacher is pretty much like this he's the hod ss he deleted a chapter from our syllabus last year, not this year tho cause 12 boards portion is set by cbse but our cyclic test portions were decided by us lol, my math teacher too..but she's a little more strict
Maths ki aisi teacher impossible

Aise teachers kaha hote hai ☹️
Your 4minutes of video always enlightens our day...🌟🙂🤩
My English teacher is like: Me: Ma’am wait I just missed one word. Teacher: Look Dhruvi’s! Dhruvi: Khud guess kar! Me: Are you kidding? Teacher: Shivansh can you please keep your mouth shut!? Me: But you just asked for me to ask her. Teacher: Go to principal ma’am’s room now!! Principal ma’am: What do we have here? Teacher: He was talking and back answered me. You can handle him now. Me: Ma’am I am an innocent she literally said to ask to look at Dhruvi’s notebook because I just missed 1 word and she said stop talking! Principal ma’am: Drink water and chill out! She is suspended for 1 month. My girl best friend: I came here to see at you. What happened? Me: Wait how you came here? Anyways, Principal ma’am said that she is suspending English ma’am for 1 month! *Then we held our hands and ran away from there and shouted that You are suspended for 1 month to English ma’am!!*
I'm lucky that I got atleast one teacher like that in this year. 11th is wayyy tougher compared to 9th 😢
My class teacher is also just the same
I Could Relate To Each & Every Incidents ❤
Our class teacher is just like that and we feel blessed...live long❤
Love from USA 💕😂
Best video I've ever got to watch❤❤❤
I have a teacher like this Nishtha 1
I have a teacher like this.
Teachers in schools really need to be paid well. Trust me..
Sapna dikhata hai madarjaat😢
Content ka keeda also here.. ohh!!
I wish my class teacher would see this...she's literally the most meanest teacher ever...she made my friends distanced from me...and literally humiliated me in class almost every time. She was the reason of my bad mental health for almost half of 2023...
Thi 4:23 min video is the best 😊 part 2 please 🥺🥹💓
Such teachers are possible only in filter copy videos 😅
Ram Sir aur Naina Mam jaise teachers sirf picture me hote hn😢 Asli me school faculty ki inse jalti h
Kash aasi hii teacher mere class mai bhi hoti... Please bring part 2 of this please 🙏
I have same teacher like her
Seriously we all deserve this type of teachers but this is far from reality we didn't get but our future will definitely get this ❤
This made me feel happy and smile❤️❤️
I had this type of teacher
My class teacher eat chocolates with us  The first moment have happened to us
i have a teacher like her and i love her. my chem teacher is just like this
Ergo a fantasy sketch. Warm and fuzzy to watch.
Chhavi bhi mera name hai me apne mummy ka phone use karti hu istleye Poonam is written but at the last when she said next Chhavi I was like why is she calling me I felt for a moment plz plz plz I want a next part
It's quite rare to have such teachers. Growing up, most of the teachers I saw were more like tyrants and dictators who handled the class with an Iron fist. This might sound like an exaggeration, but this is the reality for most of us. This made school life even more depressing and difficult for those who were average or weren't the best in academics. In Parent Teacher meetings or Results day, the teachers barely spoke about a student's forte and only mentioned the negatives of each students. What's more messed up is that some parents tell embarrassing things about their kid to the teachers and the teacher then embarasses the student in front of the class. I really hope our generation will fix this and be better teachers...ones we never had
The most wholesome vdo I saw all day
The title best captivates the video. Sachmein teachers should be like vikas sir, my history sir, and my one mam
This just melts my heart. 3 of my school teachers literally tortured me mentally so much that I even thought to suicide. I was so depressed that time. Day by day one of my friend supported me and made me good. If I ever get any responsibility to groom kids or support kids I'll literally try none of them feel neglected alone and humiliated.
Ohk so I have the same Teacher nd i feel so lucky
https://youtube.com/shorts/oeS590pOlcw?si=FvJiT_mzIKge7IMU
we all deserve a teacher like this:)
Smile with wet eyes
I had these teachers during my 12th boards ❤
Ideal things doesn't exist
Well my class teacher is exactly like her but my class don't deserve her  She cried for us yesterday really feeling guilty for our behavior and she took all the responsibility now she have to quit this job ! 😭🥺
ME WHO KNOW CHAPTER 5 IS AP (ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION)😂😂
Really cool kash hamare teachers bi ese hote

Aisi teacher bas videos ya movies mei hi hoti hai 😂
I wish we had these teachers

Teacher in parallel universe 😂😂😂 who agree with me ???
Not all people get to experience this type of love and understanding ❤️‍🩹..... But those who have this, should always cherish and save the teacher ♥️🤧
We have 3 teacher like her❤😊
Areh yeh to main hu 😂😂😂
There was a teacher like her in my 10th std
Agreed ❤❤
I have one teacher not same but similar to her only and I love her she is not my teacher only she my friend
Yarr this mam has a good pronunciation and have beautiful speaking tone  I hope she would continue these videos
Agr asie teachers ho to life set ho jayegyi😊😊❤
Seriously I feel I am unlucky in school days
When I was punished and asked to stand outside by the teacher, I used to count it as an acheivement and used to giggle with my friends outside class . ❤❤❤
The sports part got me broo I wish our school had these type of teachers like no one encourages me/us to play football 😭
hamare class me 50 hote the  yahape only 10 !!!😅
Best video everrr!!
Guys let's make youtube comment's section into instagram comment section💀
Teachers in parallel universe. 🗿
Trying to be that teacher. IN SHA ALLAH
I have this type of teaher in my university... Miss hina
Only few days left for my school, but I am glad I had few of this kind of teachers...they were like flames in winter, so warm that unhe chor kar abhi is "cold" hearted world se kaise deal karna hay pata hi nhi, unlike others I have rarely felt ki school se behtar college hay , kabhi kabhi kuch teachers ki waja se dukh hua hay pr I knew ki other teachers are there.....really going to miss school life, one of the longest relationship of almost 15 year is about to end and I feel like I am falling apart.....aj last time class dekha fir sidha exam halls and practical....I am just extremely emotional today 😭
In my school there is a sir like her ans he's adorable and great just admire him a true gem loved this video❤️❤️
Chane ey illa, it's like u were in a day dream
none of my teachers were relevant .I was so scared from my teachers.
I was eating biscuits during class and my teacher caught me and said akelay Akela kha rhy
I"m so lucky that my school encourages these types of teaching methods.    Love from Bangladesh❤
Class 10 chapter 6 maths carries 10 marks how can you skip it ?
After scoring low in 12th they will blame teacher 😅
I had my teacher in X grade named as Surendra Sir who taught me very well and because of him I scored 94 in board exams Computers 🖥.   Guess what Im fond of Computer programming , he would conduct extra classes that would really engross us in subject .  Plus he was a CS graduate of 1990s which is not a small feat , having a wealth of knowledge and experience.    If Principal of my school could be like him then it will be wonderful for sure even if it may require Archana Maam to go away .
I'm  so lucky i've had a teacher like this..she made me love the subject though i was not scoring very well and i ended up scoring much better..
Hypothetical Teacher😅
Students look older than miss😅
I had one in class 8 see was my geography teacher and English teacher as well as class teacher
But math textbook mei toh sirf 14 chapters hai Moye moye
delulu
I have one like her, she is my chemistry teacher
I know 1 good teacher in my school hema mam
Guys.... Make videos for dog lovers 😍
I have never seen such type of teacher in my life💔
Don't Compare Harsh with KinG KohLi 😂
part 2 plzzzzzzzzzzz
Omg! I had tears in my eyes!! Wish we had such lovely teachers back in high school then maybe we Indians would have rocked in every field.
good video
Jai lashqdwep 🙏🙏
dream
Madam mathematics ka chapter yaad raka rahi thi aur bol rahi thi — you must learn all the chapters When mam is from Arts stream but video ma Maths teacher.
it reminds of that one teacher who was just like her❤
Nice Drama Funny Series
How to share this video to my teacher without actually sharing it?
Hamare school me esa hota hai❤❤❤
And then harsh becomes Rinku Singh
I have a teacher like her even he is our best friend 😊
❤
Next Virat kohli😂😂😂😂
Good teachers in Indian is rare because of shitty policies like reservation
Teacher acting level is so outstanding
Man in my entire student life, I did not see a Math teacher who is so chilled out 🛠️
No one els can play like virat kohli.
who all r in 10th and knw tht only 14 chs r der in maths  drop a like👇
Too good to be true !
Yepp its the reality vs the expectation 😂😂 But in reality some teachers do exist like thiss..❤

I Aspire to Become THIS Someday 🧿😇..
Very nyc teacher❤😍 n video
And why do you Deserve them?

Yeah we deserve a lot
agar aise teacher mila hota aaj mai ek cricketer hotha :)
That made me cry...
Many of a young teachers are like her.
The last part 🥹
Extra classes😂😂😂😂
❤
In dreams.. Kabhi possible nhi hoga yee
Hamari to thiiii😊  11th 12th me❤ aur abhi bhi hain 😎......
its very rare to find a teacher like that i wish this come in real life ❤
She was like the teacher(aamir khan) in Taare Zanmin Par
very relatable
I wish I had that type of teachers
Ohhh my god that's totally me 😅😅totally relatable ❤❤
A lot of people complaining about the teachers here but that wasn't my experience. In my school most teachers were good.
My Class Teacher this year is exactly like her! She is actually so sweet. She teaches English! I was so happy and lucky to get her as my C.T❤ she helps a lot in each situation... She is just like a mother to me. Whatever the problem is just go to her and tell her she'll solve❤
I really miss my teacher.. she is exactly like her... If I get rewind watch or any super power to go back for school days then I will...
Bro F  to P??
!!  I wanna this type of teacher!!
the script was very good until ye next virat kohli banega vo toh ek hi hain tha aur rhega  poori duniya mein
I have a teacher sweeter than she was...and the reason I am studying with determination without being lackadaisical is her. I want to be like her.
Mathematics learn karna hota hai..................??????? Iss video ko dekh ke pata chala,.....
Such teacher comes from rare species.....
Why this teacher looks me like somewhat 'Madhuri Dixit '😅😅
Every student wants understanding teacher like her....I love her way of speaking and handling situation...👍👍👍
i miss my primary class teacher🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 relatable
When I was in 6th grade my history teacher was like this only She used to help all the students not only in history but other subjects too During exam time she used to give us previous year notes of toppers so that we can have a reference on how to write a particular answer to get full marks  I am in 12th now  She's retired, i still go and meet her at her house
Not just teachers, students also should reciprocate. Nowadays if there are few teachers who care, there are fewer students who care about the teachers. When we were in school, we always had a healthy relationship between the teachers and students.
Who wants part 2❤
Want a pt 2
❤😊
The best teacher we could possibly find in a whole era
Having these types of teacher is such a blessing who can understand you. It's very hard to find these types of teacher in India especially.

You really think you all deserve this type of teachers,after all you have done in your school and college

Indian teachers in parallel world:
Is video me dikhai gayi ghatnaon ka vastavik jeevan se koi sambandh nahiye
To all who says such teachers are Rare to find. Let me tell you my story and blessings of my teachers...I graduated in 2005 in Pharmacy and have worked India and overseas in Research and development. I come from poverty ridden family and studied in Marathi (regional langague) school. I still talk to my school teachers.. i used to visit them every year without fail on Guru Poornima. Now cell phone and whats app has given better connectivity. I visit my science teacher who told me in 9th class, she is sure I will make it big.. i visit her once in while to get her blessings.... I speak to my school arts teacher who taught me many positive things in life. Now retired he works for upliftment of tribals.. my English Teacher who told me.. langauge can be learnt and I must be proud my hertiage and langauge.. I visit him in school and he blesses me still. My Pharmacy professor speaks to me weekly to push me to do better in life... I am turning 40 this month and every time I am lost I connect to my teachers. Even if I have thriving Corporate career, global confernece speaker and blah and blah I feel what my teachers saw in me that time and trusted and nurtured is what I am today... remember everyday they seee multiple classess and multiple studient. They can teach go home and forget and every yr there is new class.. yet these are people who geneuinely want you to succeed. Kudos Teachers who build numerous futures!
meri english teacher aisi hi h
but india mein to thik iska ulta hi hai
I can never believe that a Math teacher like this can actually exist, even I'll not be this lineant
This video reminds me of my school days❤
aise mushtande bacche kaunse school mein milte hai ?
i had teacher like this in my 10th  as my class teacher
Our class teacher is just like that. Class 12 .... so she is just like a friend although she is above 50 but still she is so cool and she is very fashionable
Heyyy... Can u make a video on" When u choose basic maths in 10th"   Plss plss I really love u content pls
if i had a teacher like this i would ace the subject she teaching
I remember my school days, we have one teacher who does same for us. I really miss those days and our favourite teacher.
The guy with history textbook when teacher was telling maths lesson to skip 🤡
We too deserve this kind of maths teacher 🥲😭
The utopian teacher🥲
When i was in 7th i was very weak in maths and hate it then i joined a tution sir he's from our schl but he never get our cls so i didn't know about him so much but after he is so good like mam in this video and very funny friendly also ❤ now i toped in maths ❤
really awesome work really I loved it 👏👏👏👏
Yr kash aise teacher school me mili hoti aaj mai tho apne school ka Virat kohil Hota.
Teachers in parallel world kyuki all we got and will get is     Is this a fish market, I want pin drop silence
I could tell by the book itself that it was the 10th standard. You cannot overlook it at this point.
I hav studied fr the book she hold its maths book of 10 th cbse board 😂😂😂
Teachers in parallel universe 😢😅
I have a teacher like her❤ and it feels like I am so lucky to have a teacher like her. 😊
Teachers are under so much pressure these days to produce results and are paid less compared to engineers or any other profession. This needs to change.
I wish we all had these types of teachers in our life. Studies would be so much easier then! But the distorted education system of ours, it makes education only a matter of depression and mental distress. Some teachers won't even teach properly in the class cause then they won't be able to run their coaching centers. We need good and friendly teachers folks!!
This is rly good fr!!
The character is just like our previous class teacher .. our lovely bhanu mam.. i Miss her so badly 💗
Ye sab bas in dreams. Appreciate it though
Thank you so much for this video 🎉🎉I'm glad you enjoyed the video and that it brought back positive memories of your teacher.
But some students are not deserving...
but 10th ka ch5 to arithmetic progression hai wo to sabse kam weightage ka hai
It's amazing when this video is sent to me by my ex student. ❤
Aisi PTM toh sab deserve krte hai
10m stopped❤😢
meanwhile, my teacher whooping my ass with a whip
For me, it was my maths teacher. He always protects us from our parents and let us eat in class while writting ♥️
@FilterCopy part 2 please
i had a teacher like that
I have that teacher
Yes!!These kind of teachers exist!! We have our class teacher like this!! He is a gem!! Never scolds us for the fun we have in his class....we are very lucky have him as the class teacher🎉

haath mein maths ki book bachhe underline kar rhe hai science ki book mein]
Teacher in parallel universe 🤡
there aren't 18 chapters in class 10 maths ncert?
Itna jawaan baap ! Cast toh thik se chun lete 😀
This video made me feel that a good teacher can change or destroy the trajectory of future.
This is what Youtube should recommend everyone
who exactly is writing with a highlighter?
Teachers in parallel universe 😂😂
Damn feeling lucky cuz I have such teachers
0:29 is that 10th maths ncert the reason of all headache 🤧
here for KHUSHI DA QUEENNNN
It's my luck or what I don't know but I have 3-4 teachers who are just like her I'm so happy to have them
Anyone notice class 10 mathematics book
Maam's got maths book in her hands... But why the students marking in diff diff book-?
W  teacher ❤️👏
Bit ch 6 of maths class 10 is way very imp that is triangles
I had one teacher like her.. in school time… the more you grow in life,the respect for her also grows with you…!!
We want part 2 for this
i am very lucky that i have this kind of teacher in my life
Bhai itna such nahi bolna tha 😢
After reading some comments I think I'm lucky that in our school we have one teacher like the 😅
I AM SO MUCH LUCKY THATI HAVE SO MANY SIRS AND TEACHERS LIKE THIS TEACHER ❤❤
Why we didn’t have such teachers in our time 🫡 well it’s just a scene real things ig doesn’t exist
Its a math book of class 10 which has only 15 chapters😂
parallel universe cant believe maths teachers can also be like this lol
i had such teachers in my school
Yrr aise teacher hamari life ma ho to ham to bhi kabhi bhi school bank na mara or tope kara bo alag 😅 bas Jo man ma aay bo bol diya kyu ke baat karna ko to aay koy ha he nii na koy friends ha na 😞bhut kuch bol diya sorry 😔
Iss video me dikhai gayi sabhi baate kalpanik hai  Iska vastavikta se koi sambandh nhi hai 😅😅
Being a teacher myself, I could see myself in her. I wish all children could be treated with kindness.
Teacher in parallel universe 😂
DO YOU ALL MAKE VIDEOS SIMILAR TO PARALLEL UNIVERSE
fact: we deserve that teachers. but that teachers don't exist in this education system. specially in government school.
Filtercopy it's been 5 years watching your content and this video i was longing to see and today you fulfilled my wish🎉 Thank you filtercopy for always making such a great content❤ LOVE FROM GUJARAT HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎊 MAY THIS YEAR YOU MAY UPLOAD UNBELIEVABLE CONTENT😊
Ideal teachers ideal society
Teachers in parallel universe ❤
They exist guys we already had such teachers❤😊 they just showed my school life😢
The best teacher
0:44 This reminded me of a SYBA public administration teacher who used to discuss all the important questions and topics before the exam. Those topics used to come in the exam and we used to score good marks in the subject!
Extra class... Kya samjhe
Ye teacher mil gayi bas.. Aur kuch nhi chahiye 😅
Agar aisa teacher merko milti toh mein pakka unko purpose kar deta 😂❤👍
This generation will never see a teacher like her. The education sytem has become so corrupted that finding kindness and care is rare. if you do feel blessed😇
Great teacher 👍...
Now look, the thing is most teachers start teaching with this is mind, but Indian schools don't allow teachers behaving like a human:(
Ye to humara maths book h
We want part 2 as well
dhet teri ki teacher se jhagra karne ka jo maza hai wo anmol hai
Math ki ncert book me total 14 chapters he aur mam 18 bol rahi h 😅 aur 6 chapter to 📐 triangle he use keshe skip kar sakte h 😊
@filtercopy Please make a video on the current education system vs ideal education system where we all learn something by interest not just for name sake
Our school is filled with these memorable teachers now, when I was in 6th Grade, 50% teachers are not even teaching properly, but new teachers came in 8th Grade which were nice and caring and I am preparing for Boards thanks to the teachers, I can understand the topic whenever taught in the class.
The possibility of getting such a teacher is 0.0000000000000000000000001%
Meri teacher naoseen man he's so beautiful
Aisi teacher mere class me bhi thi or unka naam madhvi tha
Wohoo💃
Sorryy.... I can't relate 🥲

While watching this only 1 teacher came in my mind our geography teacher ❤
Trust me when I say this it's not the teacher sometimes who should be blamed it's the school management. I'm speaking this from my experience teachers are forced to follow certain rules to sustain '"discipline"
The problem with this is that all teachers want to be like this. I have experienced it first hand, snd seen the difference between a teacher who was like this and a strict teacher. Eventually the students end up misusing the privliges given by the kind teacher and that teacher has no choice but to become more strict... It is we who are at fault.
0:33 IMPOSSIBLE HOW CAN THERE BE 18 CHAPTERS IN 10th NCERT???!!!!
First getting this type of teacher is like a fairy tale and more important sports doesn’t means only that shit cricket so pls. Stop hyping that shit cricket in the name of sports total nonsense
if there were no responsibilities id certainly become a teacher. passed out school 11 months back. video got me teary.   - 5/11/24 23:31
Is episode mei dikhaye gaye sabhi patra aur ghatnaye kalpanik hai..inka vastavikta se koi sambandh nahi hai..
to be honest  cringe.
My physics teacher is exactly this way....😎🥹
My teachers are like her❤
we had Same Maths teacher , he was just so supportive of us .God somehow we all lost contact with him 😢
#47ontrending in just 11h
Why Batter always when it comes to cricket??   Why can't he be the next Jasprit Bumrah or next Mohammed Shami ???  2023 WC ke baad bhi sudhaar nahi aaya... Bowlers ki izzat hee nahi hein
We all need this kind of teacher . It's feel like it's imaginary cause it's hardly to get such kind of teacher 😢😢
Filtercopy finally stopped farming old content. 🎉
Funfact : chapter 3&4 of maths don't have any formulas😂(std10)
Fortunately we do have such a type of teacher. She's the best!
We have   our  maths sir like this..❤😅
lucky to have a teacher like this<3
Our chemistry mam is sweetest teacher. She really cares about her students.
YEH VIDEO KAALPANIC HAI ISKA WAASTAVIKTAA SE KOI LENA DENA NHI HAI !!! 😥😥😥

After balh 3 filtercopy

I an glad to have teachers like this 😊😇
She is giving 18 chapters to learn while holding maths 10th Ncert which has 14 chapters
Esa laga mai koi sapna dekha Raha hu . I love it 😊
Alhamdulillah I have the exact same teacher, apart from letting us eat lunch during lecture, after all its for our betterment to understand the concept properly, shes a Gen Z and truly understands us
Esii teacher humare gareeb school Wale kyu nhi lete aur woh maths bhaiiiii😂😂
I have this kind teacher
After , leaving school life , preparing for college entrance exams  Students be like **dead
As a matter of fact, My class teacher is like this.  Love you Ma'am❤❤
Madam toh maal h
Glad I found some teachers like them 🥰
Broo this is exactly like my class teacher in 11th but now she left the school
1:09 triangles skip kar diya💀
I am lucky that I have the best teacher for my accounts H V Arora sir
she suggested skipping triangles and give attention to real numbers lmao
She's a dream teacher everybody wants to have ❤
I was having that type of teacher in my school days but not that perfect as like in this video....But she is a great teacher
Fact: This type of teacher didn't exist in my schooling days
I really had this type of teacher even though she isn't teaching us anymore me and our all class will never forget her and we really miss her, she always used to save us from other teachers and was really cool I really miss her
think about  our world if did this over choosing the excellence
FunFact: On NCERT Maths TB Only 14 Chapters Are There(Ch-11/Construction is Removed Also)
She is not just a teacher we deserve, she is our dream teacher too 🥺🥺
She looks like Madhuri Dixit
No I was the same teacher when I teach
I think the title should be teacher in parallel world😆
AHM.. AHM... GUYS LUCKILY WE GOT A TEACHER JUST LIKE HER AND WE ALL LOVE HER VERY MUCH SHE IS ALSO OUR MATHS TEACHER
My old schol teacher of ss science maths were all like these   I miss them so much after coming in 11
These teachers are only found in fairy tales, i guess
If you are a Teacher hit ❤
These kind of teacher just makes the study easier for usss i am glad that i had these types of teachers but some students misuse these and be lazy. That's where our parents don't like the teachers to be that soft.. Love for teachers to giving us this beautiful knowledge gift....❤❤
It would be like a dream come true if students get to have teachers like this, but students too should do their part of work. These days students are not as well mannered as we believe they are, which makes teachers to take strict actions.
Too much unreality
I had a teacher like her but that teacher left I am very lucky to be that teacher's student
She soo beautiful yarr
I'm lucky that I have teachers like her ❤❤
I had my teachers like her ! They were amazing 🎉 I think at the tender age we don't really understand what lesson are our teachers trying to imbibe in us but when we realise it's little late.
Teacher wo bhi Maths ki??? Bhai kis planet ke ho aaplog?
Every Students deserve Sweet teachers  😊😊😊😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aise teachers to bas Sapno me hi exist krte hai fr🙂
India ki Naya Kohli 😅
Le me , taking my ncert maths text  and looking up whaterver she said  LOL
Harsh naam ke character me sirf shashwat acha lagta h❤

Let's vote if your bestie could hear your thoughts
The thing is that even when we teachers are doing the best to be good for students, the sheer lack of support from the right places is what pulls us down. The lack of respect, support and the required discipline is something that is very common in the students of this era… and people are quick to judge us teachers, lecturers and professors where as this is inadequacy is never one sided.
this kind of teacher can not exist..
Utopia😢
Beautiful episode
Miss you Nisigandha mam what a great teacher she was
Ah, I can proudly say that I am 85% similar to this teacher,
10th me 18 chapters kabse aa gye😂😂😂😂😂.
❤❤❤❤
Yes, i was so lucky that i got 2-3 such teachers in my primary and highschool🥰
One video," Filter Copy " shouldn't have made 😐,
Nice 👍🙂 aise teachers hum ko nahi mile
Aisa koi teacher nahi hota #utopia #Perfect Teacher
chapter 6 has a weightage of 9 marks dahell dont skip it

Virat kohli : kuch jyada nehi hogya 😂
We want this type of teacher but it can't happens 🤣😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yea all boys deserves such a cute teacher 😂😊
She is not a teacher she is every student's dream❤🥹 but unfortunately she stays in our imagination more than in real life 🥺
Teacher in PARRAREL UNIVERSE 🥹
congrats for 10 millions. This is such an amazing video loe your content<3
Teachers in parallel universe🗿
I don't wanna brag but I am teacher just like her....if this is what is called good teacher..thn I am so proud of myself...😚
Too False to be True
This is good, but I miss the old filtercopy cast more. The chemistry among all of them was amazing.
We honestly had a teacher like her she was so kind and was like a friend to us  who share lunch with us .She never forced us for exams and even in periodic test she allowed us some limits of discussion. Her teaching skills were great and she was kind to us and nature too.But we lost our diamond after covid.God was so unfair with that.😢
Class 10th ki maths ki ncert me 18 chapter hi nhi hain ?
Abb extra classes me asli profit hoga 😂😂😂
my older brother was truly gifted in music and was probably the next kailash kher but my parents weren't as supportive as this wonderful teacher and now he works a minimum wage 9-5 with depression and my parents call him a failure because he refuses to get married. I wish adults were more understanding
#VPMam   Cuddalore PSBBians like 👇👇👇👇👇👇
1:02 tr maths pada rahi hai Students kuch or sub padh raha hai  Heyy prabhuuu😂😂
My school teacher later became an advocate. After 15 years my classmate n best friend approached her to get rid of her casanova fiancee. She, instead of helping her had an extra marital affair with her fiancee. Imagine, she was our class teacher in 5th grade n she having an affair with her student's fiancee. Women r desperate. Aur hum mardo  ko faltu mein badnaam kiya hua hai.
Fantastic !! Way to go !
A humble request!...please make: Every Virat Kohli fan ever It'll be fun to watch ❤
Filter copy never fails to teach us a good lesson….. ❤
teacher esa hona chahiye ki.... 1. Do chate lagata dono ke pehele. Kyuki tiffin me sirf sandwitch tha. Fir tiffin cheen leta, aur maal khake khaali tiffin lotata. 2. jo bhi skip karne kaha, aur important nhi hai bataya...usi me se poora paper set karta. 3. Chalo andar ki jagah, tapti jalti dhoop me murga banata. homework nahi complete karne pe. 4. Fail hone pe roj class ke baad rok kar, 3 ghanta extra class leta fissaddiyo ki. Saturday sunday ko bhi. Tapti jalti ghamori wali garmi me. Fir chhe pankha kyu na band karna padta. 5. Double period me, saare equations first period me poora karke, agle period me ground me lejake, tapti jalti ghamori karne wali dhoop me bethake, equation ke extra questions practice karwata. 6. Parents teacher meeting me bolta...is fisaddi ki to me extra class lunga tapji jalti ghaori waali dhoop me. Aur sports bhi karwata. har galat jawaab ke liye, shotput wali ball uthake ground ka 3 chakkar lagwata wo bhi tapti jalti ghamori wali dhoop me. Bina paani ke. Ek taang pe.   just kidding!!
She looks like a mix of Daya bhen and Madhuri Dixit
Lunch Box eating during class and ma'am say "that" thing.. actually happened in my class 😅 by my own class teacher
Yrr ek aisi maths teacher toh mai bhi deserve karti hu ❤😊
1:37 yo Madhuri Dixit
Shes telling the chapter from maths book and they are marking in science book lmao but nice video filter copy
I really Miss my School Teachers 🙃
I'm cooler than this
I am an Indian student studying in focus high school in Hyderabad and I am very proud to say I have 5 teachers like that in my school . Very lucky to find such gems 💎
Aisi teacher milna aur Pakistan ko Kashmir milna are Impossible.
Everyone will say we don't have such good and understanding teachers. But do you know even not all the teachers have such good students who listens to them and respect them. So the change should come from both sides not form only teachers.
❤❤❤
She is dream teacher of all students but very very rare to find teacher like her
0:32 but class 10 mein toh 14 chapters hai bss😂😂
😮I have a teacher like her but he leaves the school
I am a teacher, students are my friends. But Some students are very toxic to deal. But after 5-6 years the naughty students again come to meet me and speaks how much they are missing school days and me.
teachers exist in parallel world
Teachers in parallel universe❤
They exsits only in parallel universe ...😄
Make one more video on this.... Asal jindagi me nahi , kam se kam internet pe aise teacher dekhke padhne ka man karta hai ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
whyyyyy jale pe naamak chidak rahe ho literally had a teacher like this and she left recently and by that i mean 2 days ago but she is still in touch with everyone
She is Kirti from bade achhe lagteee hh❤❤❤
@filtercopy I don't why she loog so good in teacher btw she is so cute and adorable ❤️☺️ she is very perfect in techer role ❤️
My teacher is the OPPOSITE.. once I had gotten very good scores in every subject but barely passed in maths… my teacher was so cruel she did not discuss on any other subject but maths.. I hate her but I am happy that my mother was by my side and told the teacher that if maths is not my cup of tea then it’s ok and that I am very good in dance and all…❤
I did have a teacher like her
she is my DREAM teacher but sadly most of my teachers are rude ,,..
han bhai real number padhte hai Traingles skip kar dege aisi teacher hame bhi ho
My name is also Khushi ❤
Seeing a teacher like that  Makes me feel even more relaxed  That's really beautiful to just watch this  It really is hopeful  I was really happy to watch this  Nice one @filtercopy😉
such a cute teacher
Ye video dekh je ek hi शब्द याद आता है काश😊😊😊
❤
We actually have a teacher like that  in our college
I had a teacher exactly like her and she was one the best things to have ever happened to me. She was the nicest, sweetest person. She helped me soo much in both school and personal life. I still keep in touch with her pr I really miss those school days and physics classes with her
..............In dream onlyyyyy😂
I also want this type of teacher❤ And I love your videos ❤❤
Where do we find such sort of teacher? Not even in dreams😂
I think that the title is so true. Even I had a teacher like her and fortunately still do!! ♥♥
It's weird how filtercopy is still stuck in 2015 in terms of the content it's creating.
1:!4 Triangles kaun skip karta hai💀
1:36 i have this teacher
Luckily  i also have teacher like her 😊
I was fortunate to have many many teachers like this in school❤😊
I already have one 😅😊❤
I had a smile on my face the whole time!
Missing devashi and old team😢
⚠️ This is purely dillusional and far from reality 😂
I can proudly say that I have this type of teacher even in all subjects❤😊
Part 2 please 🥺❤️
Madam Rashmi Bindra 😍
It's very rare to find these GREAT TYPES OF TEACHERS ! I was fortunate enough to get one in btech degree 1 year in my whole life
The suitable title : Teachers in parallel universe
Ese ache teachers zyada tik nahin pate schools mein q k kuch chugalkhor students ma'am ko shikayat laga dete hein unke baare mein bura bolte hein phir uske baad teachers kabhi wapis se rude ho jate hein ya kabhi unko nikal diya jata hein school se😮😢
My class teacher is exactly like her
Glad to say that our class teacher is 80% like her only 😊😊
Iss school mein toh teacher student ki umar ki h😂
If we got teachers like her, we would pass school but fail life.
Yeh video mujhe mere 4th class ki teacher ki yaad dela diya  woh next year school chhoda de 😭 unhe chhode hue 6 sal se jada ho gaya par still woh jaa bhi yaad hai achee Agar life me aapko sahi time pe sahi person mil jeye rasta dekha ne ke liye toh aap kabhi nhi batak paaogi woh mam bilkul waise thi Miss you pareenata mam 😢
I already have this kind of teacher ..... and i really love her 🙈💕💞💗
This was our milu mam
Ek din mera be comment Viral hoga 😢
This Video missed a key element   The Key Element : for freshly brewed content like this keep watching filter copy!!🎉
Very nice intelligent teacher
It's very difficult to find such a teacher in present generations but we can see in the next following generations...❤❤
Teacher in parallel universe😂😂😂.
All videos are so much inspiring that they always bring a natural smile on my face   Thank you for such amazing content,we will keep supporting filtercopy♥️♥️
Kitni sundar hain mam❤❤❤❤
Can you all make one on the monitor we all deserve
I teach English to the class 12th soon we formed a bond and now they are like " Mam aap to samjho aapke alawa humara hai kaun "😂 . When am on leave I miss those faces 😅
Dreamy teacher❤
My teacher made me quite  sport in parents meeting :(
being a 10th grader..noticed how ma'am's got math tb and everyone has sum else lmao...anyway sending love from dubai hahah
My maths teacher gives the difficult questions as homework and in class she solves the easy ones 😂
School days ki memories refresh hogyi bro🥺
Proud to be like her .. Always cooperative , approachable and understanding attitude for my lovely children ✨
Video  to thik hai par  wo  thodi si kali wali student usually face   reza and pooja khan   youtuber ka  pooja ka jaisa  nahi lgta kya😂😂
My old student sent me this & said this is you ❤ I love the compliment as I love being among students & handling their day to day problem happily 🎉
Alternate title: The teacher we never got or get in future 😅
When you realize its not real ☠️ :)
She is always good for teacher role
Speaking honest school teachers are far more better than college teachers
She is like our Psychology miss..she is the best!!💖💖
10th standard students can easily relate 😂😂
I had a mam like her i was too blessed to have as her a teacher ❤
I am missing old FC😊
0:59  bhai hd hai mam maths padha Rahi hai or bachhe science ke book khool ke bethe hain 😂😂😂😂😂
u cant skip triangles maam1:25 chptr 6
Bro 10th me maths me 15 chapters he hai 18 chapters kidhar aa gaye? 😂😂
I had a science/class teacher just like her. She helped me improve my science marks from 75% to 93%. She was an amazing teacher and saw true potential in every one of her students.♥♥ However, due to the politics inside the school, she was forced to leave and had to join another school. I feel bad that such politics happens only to awesome and understanding teachers.
we want this type of teacher
You showed me something impossible 😂😅
Yesssss we all want her
I have a teacher also like her....but in few days he will leave the clg for further studies.....l never saw a teacher like him.He is so caring & so understanding.I also mention his name that is "Jatendar Lalwani".His name is also unique like him.
my inner child is healing by this video🥲
Yrr mai ro dunga 🥺
I wish I had a teacher like her atleast she would have helped me  pursue my basketball championship 🙂but i had the exactly opposite teacher who ruined everything 😞
Wow❤
Haaa yrr aisi teacher to mai bhi deserve krta hu......waise aisi teacher to thi school me mere bhi but parents meeting me sab me DOGLAPAN pata nhi kaha se aajata tha😅💔
Aaj ke zamaane mein asy teacher milna bahut mushkil hai due to this bull shit education system of India 🤬
Welcome to Dreamland and No Real... Just Dululu cause it's the only solulu
Kya faida esa teacher ho k v?? Students toh mante hai nai, taken for granted ho jata hai tab... Actual emotions pyaar care woh log samajhte hai... Na hi respect dete hai
kya bakchod video h, come to Kendriya Vidhalaya you will see real teacherhood (i.e torcher, mental harassment, physical also)
Thankfully i have similar trait maths sir❤❤❤
Agar meri teacher aisi hoti to mai apni problems khulkar unse kah pata. Mere teacher to ulta mera mazak banate the. Mai kabhi apne doubts unse nhi pooch paya. mai thoda introvert type ka hu. Kisi se bhi apni man ki baat nhi kah pata. Agar mere teachers aise hote to aaj shayad mai kuch or hota.
I remember when I was in class 6th There was a good teacher like her.
Reminded me of my math teacher :))
Welcome to imaginatory world
But thats the same story in USA except the part where grading .
Good teachers and mangers are so rare that diya 🪔 jala kr dhundna padta hai
When I was growing up (2002 born) i was surrounded by such teachers, and they played a big big part in shaping me as a person...i feel bad today to see that schools are barely playing any role in shaping children and neither are such teachers found much these days, everything has become so commercialized😢
Wòw
Big fan of filtercopies every vedieos.. from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇮🇳
Made me so emotional 🥹  - I remember some teachers being so helpful and motivating.  May Allah bless them and keep them in good health   Aameen
had found one but she went to canada
My CHEMISTRY sir
Fictitious exception
Agar aisi teacher Ho to student kya student ka Baap bhi Roj School aayega 😊
Look like a dream but never founded every one deserves this teacher
My aim is to be a teacher like her❤😊😅
I liked Saadhika Syal's acting so much❤
Hamare teachers aise kyu nhi hote 😭 Ptm me mummy papa ko itni complain karte hai aur aisi cheeze bhi bol dete hai jo actually me hamne ki bhi nhi thi aur un cheezo me koi aur hi involved tha.  BTW loved the video and hats off to filtercopy❤
she is so cool
Congratulations guys for 10million🎉❤
I think I am that teacher.....
i  wish our teachers were like this .....
i had this teacher in 7 n 8 -mrs preeti madnani maam allenhouse lko
We had a few teachers like this though out our school and college. We also cooperated with them wholeheartedly.... -Like unke subject ka monthly paper proper likhna baki bus blank sheets 🤣 -syallbus kuch rhh gya to bhi faculty ko bol dete the complete hai😂 -and much morw🤣
In which universe this type of teachers are😢
😊
I amount of bad experiences I have about teacher that I completely lost hope from getting a good teacher. And this video shows what I want.
I also had a teacher like her and she was my favorite teacher......  I have always scored full marks in her subject by the way she was a maths teacher😅.... But somehow we lost touch now... 😢
sending this video to my math teacher 🙂
I would say that we have such a teacher. He is just awesome! Just the perfect amount of coolness and tact 😌❤️
Aise teachers bhi hote hain kya?? Hamare yahan toh students hi itne harami the ki teachers ke efforts ka bhi koi fayda nahi hai 😢
Par ncert me to 14 ch hai
Utho utho sapna tut gaya 😂😂🤣🤣. These teachers can be arranged by dharma productions only 😂🤣.
Last few days of my school life left...and I really really think we need to have teachers like that , half of highschool 'despression' can be cured by just having nice teachers
We also got a teacher just like her but she left the school 😢😢
Awww....I want this teacher
There’s one such teacher in every school. And boy are we thankful to her.
Ladko ko acche female teachers se attachment jyada hi hota h kuch, feels sort of a soft corner.
Kash aisi teacher hamare school me bhi hoti😭😭
Fun fact - Teachers like this doesn't exist 😅😅
Maths teacher itni acchi, Impossible 😢😂
It's true example of good teacher
Agar aise teachers ho na tou koi unki disrespect na kare
Arey Madam ke sath Harsh papa ki shadi kon karaye ga🤭🤭🤭.
I am in 12th currently, after watching this vedio i miss one of my teacher so badly he is legendry his name dhaval sir😞😞i will always miss those days, he use to understand us very well. I am so sooooooooooooo lucky to have a teacher like this
i wish i had a teacher like this when i was in school
Why these type of teachers are available only in dreams ...😑😑😑😑😓😓
Fc Writers Tumne to Toh Dil jeet liya Bhai/Behen❤❤😊

She is like poonam Mishra Ma'am
Ese maths to rarely hi milte hai
Humaari teacher janaaniyaaa hoti thi
i am so gratefull and lucky that i have a teacher like her ❤
Yaah !!! There was a teacher like her in my life too  He used to encourage me to improve my skills in poetry writing I'm still in contact with my sir  Thank u 🙏 🙏🙏🙏
Sadly we find such teachers only in filtercopy videos 😂😂
Luckily i had very good teachers in my last years school life i truly miss them....❤
The strawberry dunia
Aise teachers ki complain jaldi hoti hai. Thanks to everyone
Seriously I wish I would have got 1 teacher like this😔
I am extremely grateful to have a teacher as good as her. It's been 2 years now that she's my teacher. She's so frank and understanding. She helps me whenever I fall into any trouble and motivates me when I'm sad. I share each and everything with her. Well, she's maths guru💫maths wasn't a subject that i liked but these 2 years changed everything. I've gotten way better in maths and all thanks to this wonderful person✨
Itni sundar teacher ❤❤❤
This is as much of a fantasy as Hogwarts 😂
Truee but it hurts the most when they leave the school 😭
lmao me planning to do b ed to become a teacher like this
my maths teacher is like that
❤
A teacher like her is my inspiration✨️💐❣️
Kaash aesi koi teacher hamaari bhi hoti
Luv U Mam. Inko inke saare students like karte honge. Ye sabki favourite hongi.
आपको असलियत में नहीं मिलेगी 😢madam की तरह
Thats book on teachers hand its 10th standard maths book 😅😅😅
The Only Truth of this Sketch is that it is a Fantasy
By god's grace I am studying in IHM kolkata...where every single faculty member is very good ❤...but yes one teacher is there..who is exactly like this...understanding other's problems...and like making sure..that she solves it❤❤❤
If like these teachers would be there the student will get a good knowledge and then would be freely to talk about anything to their teachers. We all need such teachers in our school. Some teachers are only coming to insult and troll the weaknesses of the students
Kitna accha sapna tha

I will definitely become like her .
I had a lot of teachers like this in my school. Anuradha ma'am and Pushpa ma'am made my life beautiful ❤
At least my children deserve the teacher like this
dude they are wearing sneakersss in schoool @!! wow.. i know bina matlb mei crab kar rah hu .. but maza arahhai!!!
I had a crush on my Social Science teacher so huge that I always scored full marks in her paper 💯
My science teacher is just like her

STARTING ke 30 sec mei jo kiya hai na tum logon nei matlb mam ki bite dekh kr mera toh man hi khtm gar diya tumne..  guys be real!!
I remembered my class teacher for 10th grade watching this video. The best teacher we had, she never used to scold us during her lesson because we used to have fun, talking while studying Biology. Her voice was also really soft, though at the end of the year it had increased because of our class 😂😂
I also had so many friendly teachers in school as well as in tuition life, and now in college life also 💯💯📚📚🥳🥳
I wish such teachers were in my school as well. Respect for such teachers
❤
disclaimer : this video may contain imaginary ideas 😪
Indian school and colleges have 100 students class, one teacher teach the class of atleast 60 this is just a fairy tale
lol ch 6 is triangles
Wow this Mam is just an absolute diamond, she is just so kind and helpful wish I had a teacher like this
We can see such type of teachers in upcoming generations ☺️
Just a wonderfully dream which is not gonna happen 😂
Par iske thik opposite wali hi milti hai😂
I'm so lucky to have a teacher like that❤😊
“The teacher we all deserve”  *“MOM” the best teacher.*
asi mam to meri school me bhi he aak🥰 , par 3-4 aur hote to me 3 din se apsent nahi mar raha hota ,like this those who are apsent today😜
No doubt she always rock, no words to define the role she play always naturalistic no other comments
One can never imagine having a Mathematics teacher like her 😂....  Plain stupidity 😅   P.S. - Comment only for fun no negative thoughts here.
My tuition teacher was just like her....❤....
Phir aise bacche food vlogger bante hain meri tarah 😂
I wish I have these kind of teachers in my school❤
esa koi teacher nhi hota kyu ch*tiya bana rhe ho
Same like my chemistry sir
If teachers r there lyk this ..all students can shine in their lyf i suppose 😂
❤
FRRRR, ISTG IF I HAD A TEACHER LIKE THIS I WOULD BEH SO HAPPI

Most of the teachers behave exactly like this after taking tuition from them.😅
Nice I wish also i got like this teacher
Aisa sirf filtercopy mai ho sakta hai
The students are lucky to have a teacher like her.😊❤ She is the pillar of the institution everyone should respect Teachers and Professors they are the true guide of society.
I am so lucky i had a teacher like this... And i miss her alot

Filtercopy, your videos are amazing as always but in the thumbnail, people are saluting wrongly which is highly disrespectful to our soldiers.....Please change it if you can !!  I am actually a big fan of your videos too but this is one small wrong thing
Bhai fr is this maths ki teacher
Aasa teacher to subko Milne chahiye
le hamare teachers;PT ka period le le,kya hi karoge khel kud kar,lunch mai kya kiya tha?,accha tumhe washroom jaana hai?lunch mai kya kiya tha?🥲
I'm lucky that I have a teacher like her ❤
Ha. Dream
Thia reminded me of my favourite teacher our principal mam, she is a very good teacher but unfortunately last month her husband died. When we went to meet her at her house, between all her sorrow what she asked us was if we told our parents that we were there or not. At that moment she instantly gained all my respect. I really wish she doesn't leave our school next year, it's my tenth and my school life will be very sad if she leaves our school but everyone is sayingn that her kids will make her go with them.
I didn't took a second to like this video. this video touched my heart. G00D J0B after all I am also a school  student.
Part 4 of the backbencher falls in love with the topper please
53RD COMMENT !!
In here in Bangladesh we got this kind of teacher but not in maths 😅. I hope these types of teachers become available everywhere in the future...😢
that leniency could act as a double edged sword as well as much as this seems nice and all certain amounts of strictness is necessary
I think the title should be the teacher in our dreams than the teacher we all deserve...just kidding😂😂
Yeh teacher mujhe dedi
First of all it's rare to find a lady maths teacher. Aur upr se math teacher itne ache ho hi nhi skte INDIA me😂😂
A good vibe video, thank you filter copy... 😊
