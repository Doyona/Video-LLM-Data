Whos the moron now?
How about that Jamie Carragher impression LMAO!!🤣
i suggest you change his profile picture. man it really hits
DeGea single handedly kept Man Utd in contention for years!!! Just like Pickford keeping Everton in the Prem, only difference is one is appreciated and one is not!!!
Onana isn't the issue. I didn't hear any united fans complaining about his signing after winning two trophies with Inter and making the champions league final? Not to mention his achievements with Ajax.  The real issue is that Manchester United ruins footballers. Is it a mentality thing? Who knows....You can count on one hand the successful signings over the last decade. You're not telling me that all the failed signings are all terrible players? No, they're all affected by a terrible club mentality. It's like an infectious disease.  Just look at the steady decline of the team's latest signings...Martinez, Casemiro, Onana, Rasmus, now even Mazraoui's form is dipping after an impressive start. The club is the issue, not the players.
INEOS OUT!
They played as good as brighton let them play , brighton took there foot of the gas last 15 minutes
The manager needs help. I mean any of the past managers, if they had staff for training, recruitment etc they could focus solely on the squad and matchday.
The formation that he use won’t work for Man united as Man united struggle in defence. He should try using to strike us out front for Help the other side.
Manchester United are completely rubbish. This is the worst I’ve ever seen them how you expect them to win with the players that we have, they’re not good enough to win anything
Manchester United are completely rubbish. This is the worst I’ve ever seen them how you expect them to win with the players that we have, they’re not good enough to win anything
UNITED ARE BACK
We never should have let Ten hag buy players for the Dutch league he should have gone after the final
I really like you but this coach is S H I T I know you think Ameron is t light but he is not , MU is not able to play his football ! You should have sticked with Ruud for this season. You will get net new players and he will be fired. And you have again wasted millions. The club is sick . You need like AjAx did with Johan Cruijff build up with old players ..In the lead in the staff …Start from scratch..But no Portuguese will save MU it’s a total miss match , sorry.
Why abandon formation? Cause this formation might get the team relegated. Just agenda's by all these youtubers. We have seen it before where a team sets up for a certain time until all the transfers are made
Casemiro, Rashford, Antony... who the hell is going to be dumb enough to pay a transfer fee and/or those wages for any of those guys?
to be up in table we need new rich  owners and 5 years
i dont think true fans will call for a new manager because we know man u have screwed him
Ten Hag did change his philosophy see what happened. Pep will not change his.
Absolutely every single British supporter wanted ineos because they would "actually care for the club unlike the saudis" Imagine an owner whonwould have cleared all debt and spent 150 M by now
When is the panic button hitting?? Relegation is on the rise now….
hate that UNITED decided to show up to both games at Anfield both last season and this one. Otherwise, they’d have gotten sorted out good n propa
RVN was doing ok in his 5/6 game stint …why change?
Paddy McCrerand 😁
Ashworth saw this coming. Big Jim wanted someone more decisive and allowed Berrarda to take full control of hiring Amorim, because he liked the cut of his jib, even though Berrarda has zero qualifications to do so. Ashworth, the man literally hired because of his track record, was ignored and sacked. No good hiring the right people if you dont let them do their job 😂
Rotten to the core..stop going supporting this rubbish 😢
Amorim turns down Liverpool for this?🤫
For me, only Amad, Mainoo, Mazraoui, Martinez, and Ugarte can stay for sure. Yoro, Garnacho and Hojlund, maybe, because they're still young. Dalot yes if he never plays left back ever again. Bruno, fine he stays because he's our current top player (which is sad if you think about it). ALL the rest need to pack and move. Again, just imo
Did Glazer instantly take 3/4 of the billion they paid for the club straight out? 17:57
What Squad is worse: Mourinio’s 2nd Amrim’s now?  After a billion spent 10:48 10:48
Same excuse it’s the owners, just face it the club is finished at top level
We will be playing in the championship next season,Millwall,Bristol City and Oxford United will be coming to OT next season!
It's not the worstteam🫣 I sat through sexton as manager in lk 5:08  stand seats Red Army👍
😁😁😁😁🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😆😆😁😁😁😁😁😁🤡🤡🤡😁😁😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
These morons are an insult to the memory of The Lawman and you should bow your heads in shame
Keep the faith. We are being had by powers that be. We will overcome sooner than we think.
Everyone talking about Hojlund not getting chances defending him. I understand that, they don’t create enough for any striker but my problem with him is he can’t even do the basics. His hold up play is diabolical, the ball just comes straight back. He’s more interested in wrestling with defenders than controlling the ball. Ridiculous!
Amar etoos Sahaj Korba Amar YouTube Naam Lohani Ahmed ek din ek subscriber one day okay Tumhe likhe love
🤣🤣 Brighton mid table team, united have been a mid table team for the past 10 years 🎉
Goldbridge Manchester United are GARBBAGE 10 Managers while Pep has been at SUPER MANCHESTER CITY
UTD never deserved Amorim. They’ve had more than enough chances to put things right and instead just keep shafting decent managers and their reputations.
Stop moaning , You had a great win midweek , relegation battle 💪💪
I miss the good old days when Goldbridge had his bum out and was twerking for Sir Jim!  😂😂😂
Go Liverpool
Funny now the shoes on the other foot,Up the Mags.
I think Amorim will be out before the summer. And return to Portugal tp take over Benfica or Sporting
conclusion, glazers out
GLAZERS OUT!!!
Poor old Ragnick clearly stated the problem when he was in charge. He talked about the club needing "open heart surgery". He also said that it would only take 2-3 transfer windows. If the club got its finger out, counting the current window as the first of these three windows, by January 2026 the surgery could be complete! But we are nearing the end of this window and nobody has been moved out and nobody has come in! What's going on? If it's cash, the combined wages of Rashford, Casemiro, Shaw and Mount must be over £3 million a month. Wouldn't it make sense to give them all free transfers and get the wage bill down?
Amorim also like eth.. rashford play good but don't want give he play.. this is karma for Amorim.. worst manager
Morning, is Amorin the only world class assest utd have?
Should have got Amorim in later for the summer but getting him halfway thru this season, you have created Interim instead who might be thrown under the bus.
Mark saying that team has got no leaders and no talent yet he named at least six of them who are a part of our future. Nice one, Mark 👍
Mark INEOS priorities are totally different. They are business men, they are looking for cheap in summer to compete in Championship. And to greater extent it pleases me that the light is being shed more on players than the manager. The problem has always been the players. Not the managers. This group and toxic environment culture has is really ruining good managers coming here.
You need to let 10/15 players go before even thinking of bringing new players
The players don't seem to be able to concentrate . Onana switches off and fucking smiles!  Show some desire boys
If I’m honest, I really don’t think Amorim is the right manager there is one glaring fact I can’t overlook and that is his experience. I know he wants to bring in his own players, but just ponder on this fact., let’s take the last team he managed and put them in the premiership, top six? I don’t think so.
Good tv good tv bro I should be able to play 2026 mark goldbridge I own the field markkkkkk
Every time one of our wingbacks gets the ball in the attack, I know the attacks over.
The players are the problem. I genuinely don’t understand how anyone can play for Manchester United and not be able to give 100% every week no matter who you’re playing. The lack of effort they put in is an insult to all the great teams and players that came before them. No one should be surprised they are the worst Manchester United team ever.
How do you solve a problem like united. Get deadwood out even if it means sacking them brake financial fair play rules, take the point's deduction, and buy every player amorim wants now
I don't see a world-class team 😢
We have so many world class players Rashford, Bruno, Casemiro, De Ligt, Mount, Antony
Sir Jim's ineos business is to get businesses for cheap stripes them out and turns a profit he is going to take over the club and run it as a business why are we letting this happen 😢
Amorim at United is Ancelloti at Everton.
Your problem is you buy crap players and give them to much wages so that they’re basically unsellable. Nothing will change until that’s sorted.
Zirkzee was good though, a striker doesn't compulsoryly need to score if he can create chances for others
And I thought Burnley had problems, you guys have a big problem and it’s not on the pitch.
Say it with me, RE LE GA TION
Sale sale sale and buy talents fro championship
The system is crap...aint working
Reckon the now or never for Amorim was because they knew if it went to summer that he was going to city?
Well Mark, I remember you saying, when Amorim arrived early, that it was a brilliant move by the owners, because it was like a long pre-season for him. He got the oppertunity to watch all the players, decide whom to keep and whom to sell and to introduce his system of playing, before the 2025/26 season.
ETH in 😂😂😂
Why upset the apple cart when the owners see 70k crowd ! Basically club owners don’t really care …
ETH out!
At least City sent Mr Law off in style yesterday....
We're not rating what they could or couldn't have done, right? We rate what they did. So Amorim getting a 5 means it's quite average for Manchester United to get out-played by Brighton? Our average performances (back when we had real standards) used to get us over the line more often than not, at the very least. What a sorry state we are in to have the ideal manager but be lumbered with a bunch over-rated, over-paid, pathetic catalogue spice boys!
You sat here shamelessly defending Ten Hag and now all of his signings are crap. Find shame, you lost all credibility with your unwavering support of Eric Ten Hag and now you need to reap what you sowed. Hold dat.
Reminds me of Mike Ashley's reign at Newcastle. Except Man Utd spent a billion on players. So it's even worse.
At home to Brentford? 🤦
Wait, I thought we’d fly up the table if we sacked Ten Hag because he was the ONLY problem with the club and our squad. That’s what the experts said, right? You know he is sitting at home sipping a brew with the biggest smile on his face having a quiet laugh at all of them. 😂
Mark is the only sane person wearing Manchester United‘s colours.
Could we have whole numbers for the ratings please. If a player doesn't deserve a 6 it should just be a 5. The players don't deserve the luxury of decimilisation; particularly when we are getting decimated ourselves.
Ten Hag got rid of DeGea, bought Mount, Antony. His decisions have set us back 5 years
I blame Amorim because Bruno and Maino need to swap positions and Onana should be dropped.
2 draws against Liverpool, Arsenal (let’s face it pens don’t count) and a win against Southampton. Everyone got too excited 1:00
United seemed to buy good players in the past ,now we get one in 4 transfers right
Maybe we should practice against the Man U woman's team... just a suggestion :D
😂😂😭🍿🍿🍿🍿 Bants club
I’m so damn sick of Onana. Not that it would’ve mattered anyway because we’re sh*t regardless, but man am I sick of seeing those mistakes.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
they're hoping that eventually a coach will come in and make all of their rubbish signings work. because to them, that's more likely than being able to sell those rubbish signings without losing 100's of millions.
Man u need to change the goalkeeper.   Put Bayindir for the remaining games. Onana is a leaking faucet.
United are the new Spurs
Ratcliffe putting the mediocre back in Manchester!!
It's hard to create when he's playing 7 at the back
Problem with United is from the top but it's not what you think. United are missing having a culture and it's the board's fault for listening to fans. It's not the players, coach, manager or board, it's a combination. If you want and example, look at Liverpool and City, both were drifting until the manager and board decided to go in one direction. Liverpool have picked a successor, not a changer, and they are reaping the rewards.
I think there’s no way United get relegated- but finishing 16th is a real possibility.
Onana gotta go man
Yeah Amorin is great 😂😂 had so much luck in before matches
This is a complete fuc...up team.embarassing to watch.loosing everytime on old trafford.get rid of some players.theyre not up for the premiership.what a mock
Bloody GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Going down going down going down
AMORIM great manager .he will bring us back to top💯
Will need to start putting backs to the wall and parking the bus to grind out the points. Let him expirment over the Summer in the UNLIKELY event that he is still there.
Southgate in, out, shake it all about.
"Go back to a back four!" Yes because it worked so well before 🤔😒 These prats are clueless about football
Just wait until Sir Jim cancels Easter.
Even the bus won't go anywhere near this lot, so it cannot be parked. Last seen leaving England heading to Holland.
They should have let the Qataris buy the club not INEOS led by Sir Jim Ratcliff in the first place.
So if Ineos forced Amorim to take it now or leave it and Amorim was so desperate for the job the he fell prey 😮😮😮
Horrible team
Tank the company. Delist the stock at rock bottom prices. ???? Profit!
Even with the Refs help they were CRAP !!!!!!!
Yes Amorim has a lot of excuses, but are you telling me that a new manager who doesn't remotely fixes any of the previous issues, ans fails to give a style of football and also gets worse results, isn't at fault at all? Lol
One thing utd fans still can't grasp, the club doesn't have much budget left for transfer, this is why they are considering selling rashford and garnacho
The penchant for playing young, inexperienced players is the reason why Manutd cannot be competitive in the EPL
The club should have been sold to the Qatari 'All the problem would have been solve
How can we create chances when the ball isn't moved forward quick keep passing back in our own half
It's crazy how bad Man Utd are and what's happened to these guys
The goalie and midfield are awful. The defense is weak. Desperate for a left back. These owners are incompetent , greedy and could care less.This team is in big trouble
Mainoo garnacho ugarte anthony deligt rasford casemiro dalot mcguire hojlund zirkzee onana. All scrap look like old players.heavy weight for the club.
Wheres sir jim ratcliffe ?
Onana out 😢😢😢
Onana out
I could feel the mood from the stadium over the television, no belief.
definately midfield is too weak scrappy goals but OVERALL i dont think thw defence is bad apart from needing a left back
onana should be ashamed!
Amorim ain’t premier league quality
Keep fighting among yourselves United fans. F'yall...
We start with 7 defensive players and play with 4 attacking players   We ain't going to improve while starting 7 defensive crap players
RATCLIFFE OUT
It could be worse, you could have Postecoglou.
What manunited need is to bring a bunch of players with no big names and no big price tags...   Two seasons of doing that in repeat will produce at least 5 players that you can build a team around....   Now start getting high profile names
This guy always has excuses after a loss. Last time it was "tsunami," then "this club needs a shock," and now it's "our team is the worst in history." What a great way to build team morale and confidence, right? Good job, Amorim!  Ten Hag only said one player wasn't good enough, and the whole world bashed him for it. But Amorim? He's the best—he just straight-up tells the world the entire squad isn't good enough. Brilliant!  Stop supporting the Portuguese Southgate
Bloody hell onana😂😂
You know why mu keep loosing games..one of the reason..onana always make stupid blunder😂😂😂
Season is lost with these jokers. Time for Amorim to tap into Academy players and stick with his formation. He might find jewels down there.
Worst 400m team ever love it...........
It's a horrible squad
Onana can't be scapegoat this time. Mid field and defense was totally invisible. GK will make misyake if he is on his own for 90 mins
كوس فورش
they are asset stripping the club so they can profit from it, get them relegated and profit again.  watch it happen.
Casemiro, Rashford , and Antony didnt  play  we  played  probably  our  best  eleven
I said it at the time, the Ineos takeover smelt like a government BS agenda type takeover. Seems to operate in exactly the same way tbh
به پدر لعنت تو به ناموس
Good he should focus on manchester united and forget about man city
Oh my goodness…Man United fans are the most hilariously savage people in the world when you guys are mad at your club! 🤣
Manchester need to get Diego Costa from Porto
Amorim aged 10 years 😢😢😢
Sack your boss 😂😂😂
Lucky amorin is on a short contract, go somewhere that deserved u, Man Utd don't deserved u
Boring Boring
Amorim’s Sporting thrashed Man City after going behind and sent them on a tailspin in form and have only just recovered from it. If I were him I’d quit.
How the f@ck did you get a point off us? Liverpool should have destroyed this Utd side. We really sh1t the bed in that game. Amorim is lost, he can't make a pie out of a cowpat.
I do better then that
Casmeiro isn't too bad Mark
That formation dont fucking work against every team that counters fast
I don’t get this whole thing about united need better players, you spend 100 and 100s of millions and you get good players they just don’t perform at united. It’s the coaches fault not the manager but the coaches who actually train them, that’s the issue
If we relegation con. Then I'm manager out .
I'm player's put fc
Loooooool
Need to accept we're mid table team at best will be long time before united are anywhere near challenging
MU were bad. But Brighton were very good. Grit and determination wins the day.
Soft Lad please advise your pond subscribers who you are going to buy and sell in JAN ????
Soft lad you don’t have a right back never mind not having a left back 😂 keep playing Slab Head at the back ! 😂
30 years..love from liverpool.❤
I don't know any football manager who would want to manage MU! Ruud might be available soon or Graham Potter?
Whatever manager or system used with these players wouldn’t work. Shocking group of players
Who TF is paddy McCrerand?!
I am a Chelsea supporter, i was gonna come on here and take the piss, but we are playing Wolves later today i really do not fancy our chance, your board and our board are a bunch off arseholes.
I can't with this guy! He said the ref was the most creative player for Man U in this game for awarding the penalty😂😂😂
Amorim is to blame for Manu losing so many matches because the system he wants to play doesn't work! Simple as that, why is everyone beating around the bush about that! And I believe his system will not work in the Premier League! Because the pace is so high in the league that there are always too many people behind the ball when in possession in this system. This means that you cannot quickly move the ball forward, which gives the opponent time to take up position in the defense again. Because the opponent is rapidly switching from attack to defense.
Ten Hag had the same players and was blamed when ever the team lost. This manager is getting worse results but has the backing of some of these football experts. What a joke
OLE in
Imagine being a food critique, and you're only allowed to visit the sewers. That's the position Mark is in at the moment 😬
Intelligently speaking then, man Utd needs to evaluate each current player, on how many places in the premier league there contributing, hey uh?
Funny how Goldbridge says Rashford, Casemiro and Antony are still here and are problem when none of them are playing or hardly even play anymore. Sorry Mark, I don’t think that’s the problem.
Next win is Spurs away.  However, if it doesn't we could be 17th come end of Feb.  Then relegation looms.
We create moments not chances, nothing we do is sustainable, consistent or calculated. It’s all just hurried, panicked and scatter gun
Its extremely frustrating. I ended up switching off mid way through second half. Watching the interviews afterwards its like Groundhog Day. Urgent changes are needed if they can't perform at Old Trafford on a day where we remember Denis Law.
Terrible today and zero pride.for law. Captain Bruno do me a favour couldn't captain a fish finger😂
Lets change the formation to 443, oh forget that formation is the reason Amorim is here. The formation isn’t the problem
Do you still think we are going to win the europa league? But you call some fans are delusional 🤔🤣
better off watching the women  Man City 2-4 Man United | WSL
Our most creative player was the referee... quality 😂😂😂
Ineos out board out and parasite glazers out
onana cudnt catch covid 😂 those players cudnt get up with viagra 😂😂😂
Ineos and the Glazers are the problem you can’t become a football club when there’s a billion pounds debt  The squad are millionaires they aren’t arsed
Comes to something at Utd, when Amorim says this is one of the worse teams in Utd history 🤦‍♂️
Arsenal and Mu are the same, the club's lack of ambition destroys the legacy of the two biggest clubs in England.
You need a better manger too
IT'S THE PLAYERS NOT THE MANAGER. GET RID OF ANY PLAYER STILL THERE SINCE OLLIE
Win the league 26 have faith
Ok so you criticised those who suggested to play with 4 defenders at the back but you're thinking we should get a left back. Left back in a 3 defenders system??
Get rid of DeGea and bring in Onana hes such a great goalkeeper, such a f**king mess 😡😡😡😡😡
Player that have left Manchester United have become better players
What do except. Amorim is shite.this manager can't win against Sunday league team.plz ineos give him life tym contract 😅😅😅😅😅
Amorim out!!! Time to gice Mourinho the keys
we continually hear how the g;lazers have  totally fucked up the club but the club have been badly run for decades - i remember the team were always underachievers when i first supported them - it was 25 years before they won the league after winning in 1967-   they had an outrageous slice of luck  that they ended up being managed by  the great alex ferguson- i wonder how long the wait for the league would have been without him
MAN U ARE BACK😅😅😅😅😅😅
Amorim out😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Mount was damaged goods his last season at Chelsea.
I do wonder who in this team should actually stay?  De ligt Yoro Mazroui Ugarte Mainoo Garnacho Amad Collyer possibly  And that’s about it? A case could be made for the likes of Martinez, dalot, Hojlund… but really as equal case can be made for them to go. It’s shocking.
The Glazers have spent way past a billion dollars over the past 12 years.  Horrible recruitment.
You wanted INEOS in Mark - yet they’re the problem …
Agree with not having a left back but.. why not just play one our academy players in that position? Also, we aren't able to hold the ball possession for 10sec in any part of the game? Try teaching the players that & maybe, we could have a decent team!
Amorim must stop playing Bruno and Onana because they are not playing football
Yes it's like they piss on Denis law grave sickening
Fans leaving the stadium early is not good. I watched at home and was only half interested so washed up some dishes instead. I know other people too who are fed up of watching crap performances. Utd will soon be losing fans.
The manager is playing players out of position. If he isnt getting the players he wants then He either changes the system or he tells the board f@ck you - get me the players or watch the club lose. Will be interesting to see how this ends.
'Our most creative player was the referee' hahahahaha 😂🤣😂🤣
If we have to buy players to win matches what kinda players were we buying over the years 😢
to be fair what club in their right mind would take antony or casemiro in their current form???
What choice does Amorim have, just stop whinging and let him get on with the job.
Mark you can't spend your way out of this due to PSR which ironically was brought in to stop city and chelsea.  Chickens have come home to roost
This coach doesn’t have the character and ruthlessness to succeed here, and any manager that will turn things around will start by benching Bruno Fernandes.
Ugarte isn’t good enough he’s a glorified shin kicker 😂
Tired of the board doing nothing to improve the situation. They just sit in attendance looking sour and downcast. Pathetic.
The arrogance of Amorim to think he could leave Sporting mid season to damage United furthur is  poetic justice.  I imagine he loses another two games and he gets sacked
You are sooooooooooooooooo smart, Be the Manager Mark. Once you fail.... Your life is over
Onana kept us in the game last week.
Ajax United is struggling in premier league 😂😂😂😂
get a capitalist in expect him to strip your club to the bare bones.
it's Ten Hag who ruined the club. Back Amorim
Just look at the brighton squad.. Look at how they have recruited and the players they have. United is a big club but it isnt run like it. They have multiple good players in multiple positions. Say what we like but the reality is we are a mid table team, Our players are on par if not worse than majority of the other teams in the prem. Team needs a COMPLETE over haul and amorim is quite clearly the coach we need when we are doing it.
Mid-table United 😂
You live on this Mark. If Man utd won every game your family would be broke
Amorim's system needs a complete overhaul. Use same players in a different system😢😢😢😢
BACK 4!! BACK 4!! BACK 4!! Garry?
Mark you can´t act like such a know it all when you´ve glorified Ten Hag for so long.
Stop pretending a different squad is gonna change anything. This has been going on for 10 years now. Every player coming to United fails.
When do the protests start. They will only listen when the pain for the club becomes great enough and inflicted by the fans.
For u to give Bruno  5 u are so fucking bias ,Bruno was the only complete footballer on the pitch
Why stubbornness can’t be criticised ? Amorim stubbornness on Rashford costed this team a few wins because he left out the player that can finish chances
Yes they have to go but who want a lot buy them that’s the question 😢
Man utd is loosing games after games in old Traffiord and all Mark is saying its only the players fault, both players and the coach should held responsible not only players i dont understand what Mark is smoking, other dont talk this way and same Mark said we should keep Ten Hasg after an appalling season. Coaches should never be given this kind of leverage the way utd fans and Mark is giving to Amorim, its like Amorim doesnt need to do anything and should only wait for all the players to be changed for him to get results. If a manager is getting outplayed by Southampton with 6 points and led in old Trafford for majority of the game, wont that kind of managers performance be reviewed or we just have to give him all free ride? This is being stupid
U will win again nxt wk and u will all start believing again!!!!! 😴
At 2:19.. who's Brightford?? lol
You're comments are absolutely spot on. Ineos are driving this club into the ground. I just hope the fans keep faith with RA. Ineos and Glazers need to go
Disgraceful
We are doomed with Onana in-between our sticks
Just sell all players. Start again.
Can’t argue with you .
I’m so tired of seeing him say we should have not let go of David dea every time he makes a mistake. It’s over in the past accept it. And acts like he doesn’t make amazing saves this season as well. Truth is we might need someone better but talking about how we should have never sold dea is just stupid. Let’s move to the future.
Lets be honest:  Bruno ✅️ Amad ✅️ Ugarte ✅️ Yoro 🤔 De Ligt 🤔 Maguire 🤔 Collier 🤔 Mainoo 🤔 Mazzraoui 🤔 Altay 🤔 Hojlund ❌️ Zirkzee ❌️ Ericsen ❌️ Rashford ❌️ Dalot ❌️ Malacia ❌️ Onana ❌️ Garnacho ❌️   Go United 💪🏻🔴
Our board is crap
Amorim doesn’t do himself any favours
Is there any other players in the UK who have won more Champions Leagues than Casemiro?
I want ten hag back 😢
Is there any other team in the UK with an £81m midfielder?
Denis would have been appalled by that performance - RIP Denis Law
Skipping past his boy Rasmus in the player ratings because he knows he didn't offer any answer.
Is there any other club in Europe with a £50m goalkeeper?
The only creative player we've had at the club for the past 6 years is Bruno and we've run him to the ground, asked him to do more than he should, asked him to play safer, asked him to do box to box and 10 at the same time.  Our wingers for the past 10 years have been inside forwards, creating chances for themselves but not for others. Our backs have been inept forever, defensively minded and/or scared of going forward because our "wingers" refuse to track back and defend.
What's wrong with mighty Manchester United ?
WE NEED HUNGRY YOUTHFUL SQUAD. NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK 🤦‍♂️
Is Amorim the answer though? Big build up for him but he’s never had to deal with anything as bad as this. I hope he doesn’t become the victim in a long list of failed managers. Hope he can pull this around although it’s beginning to look doubtful
BRUNO, MAINOO, UGARTE ARE NOT CREATIVE FUQING PLAYERS !!!!!!
Imagine ruining one of the best managers in the world. I feel bad for Amorim 😢😢😢
man utd no longer want to be in premier league, reminds me of when lingaard was there, they just appear on the pitch for 90 mins
You've been saying this since Fergie left.   Just hold your hands up you're not the team you were and you are not going to compete for years to come. You're to far behind lfc and city
@the United Stand why i cant see my replies to other persons?
I’d much rather field alot of the under 21s than some of these players, atleast they would be eager to prove something
Firesale? Selling a team in the Championship is ambitious work.
Mazraoui got rinsed by Mitoma on 2 goals, it can’t be a 5 for him
It was sad to see the lack of spirit in the team.  Midfield was once again outplayed. Colyer deserves to start. Zirks a lot better than Hoilund.
Liverpool brought in a new manager but made no signings. Their squad was quality,  United brought in a new manager but made no signings their squad was the problem, what did you expect
Onana is not worth that shirt he is the worsg goalkeeper in the pl and if the manager selects him always what should the fans say
Full backs not sending in crosses who is responsible for that  It’s the manager  This manager is also a prat man  He talks well but tactically is is not good enough as well. If u come to a club and not even a single player is improving then it shows you have a problem and honestly if he was improving the players with his idea then we could have more spirit as well   He puts two in midfield and expects to control the game so who is to be blamed for that mark  Short off and look at the manager too  Be sure he makes Bruno runs everywhere as well  I thought he could stabilise Bruno but he has not  Change that shitty formation honestly it’s boring
Spot on Mark: “What is he supposed to do?”  I want Amorim to stay but, I also would get it if he held his hands up and left.
I think you knew the Seagulls were going to win today. In fairness you were better at the Amex. you guys need to take control of your club, its not the United that everybody knows, mayor changes are required and people need to be humble and actually support the club.
United were playing Brighton, not Brentford, but who cares tbh.
Amorim _did_ say there would be further suffering. I guess the same old discussions will continue doing the rounds every time Man Utd lose.
Unfortunately I think Ineos brought Amorim in under the agreement to develop and improve what we have.
You were all happy when they played liverpool.. now look at ya lmao 😂
Welfare players, nothing touches the., nothing moves them, they all need to go, the whole lot of them. I would say more but it's a waste of time.
100% spot on mark he is bein thrown to the wolves ITS THE PLAYERS ITS THE PLAYERS ITS THE PLAYERS THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CRAP AND OUR OWNERS ARE JUST DISGUSTING
What was the Welsh impression on 4 mins in aid of?
Buy, buy, buy ….  Brighton played very well and is a good team. United? United isn’t.  Ten Hag clearly did a fearly good job ….
What happened to all the optimism after the draw at Anfield and the shitshow result against Southampton?
It’s all City’s fault for signing Haaland on a 10 yr deal. FOOTBALL IS DONE, ITS A DISGRACE ….Goldbridge🤣🤣🤣
Everyone just talks about bringing in players… do we really think that will change things?  Lol…
If this co-ownership is not willing to bring in new players that suit Amorim's formation and tactics, then what was the point of hiring him in the first place?
The formation ain't going work in every game. Individual errors are they main problem though, and Onana is absolutely awful.
Yes we obviously need new players..but to push us higher than last season’s finish, not to keep us safe from relegation..How bad does this have to get before we start questioning why we’re doing so much worse with the same group of players with much fewer injuries than ETH had to deal with?
Ruben Amorim - "We are the worst Manchester United team in history!".
Really tired of 'no left back ' comments!! It's only one of the many problems! Shaws 4 goals and 17 assists in 12 years isn't the miracle solution!!!
The fans fired Ole, and have been worse of since! Ole was the best coach since Sir Alex. And now Ole signed for Besiktas to do the same as he did with ManU.
This team is the worst of all time. Relegation is the way forward. This club is fucked from top to bottom. This club is a disgrace, players and all.
Give Amorim a proper window so he can bring balance to a very unbalanced squad, and hopefully get a proper keeper. Squad needs a complete overhaul...then we judge Amorim.
I was hoping for the memory pf Denis Law we would have made him proud today  Oh well
One word “ shite”
The fans booed the tribute, sickening
Pogbas the problem  Ronaldos then problem  Fred is the problem Maguires the problem  Sanchos rhe problem Rashfords the problem  Ten hags the problem   What is the fuxking PROBELM????
We need to get knocked out of Europe so that Amorim can get more training time with the players
Have all the raining sessions you need Amorim, you wont fix this current squad.
Get Rashford back in
Only Mourinho and Ole Gunnar  are called manager after Sir Alex Ferguson left Today's player are all not good enough to play for manuted
Onana its not THE PROBLEM but doesnt help
I'm almost glad when we get turned over now. Enough is enough!  Big Jim and his Glazer mates can all fk off right now!!! Where's the green and gold shirts and scarves? Where's the Glazers Out movement gone? Are the Revolutionaries eating prawn sandwiches?
Give the youth a chance get rid off the rest keep Ruben let him build his vision
Does anyone think we should have hired Nuno Espírito Santo instead of ETH at the time? Nuno was free agent at the time, and now he is in 2nd place with fucking Nottingham Forest! Why do we keep hiring managers with zero Premier League experience, man!
'We' are Manchester United. 🥱
It was all Ten Hag’s fault 😂😂😂
Onana single handedly got us out from champion league 2023/2023 he is shat, always stand like a statue who can’t save a shot
We need to sign players man. Classic mid table mentality from these players. Go and play well against the big team just because they are big then go tits up against mid table teams
Disgraceful so inconsistent and Onana shouldn't be our number one too many mistakes now Denis Law looking down in shame at these players.
Onana needs to go. Lost us too much, destroying our managers careers
Amorim is a thorough gentleman. He is worthy of a decent club and a proper administration. He is only damaging his reputation by coaching Manchester United. If he doesn't get any backing in June/July, he should just walk and let them sort it out.
Feel sorry for Amarim. Should have stayed at sporting!! If I was him I’d walk now !! Save yr career mate !! This club this team is done !! Until we’re relegated. Only then will we see the full sale off the club !! And can start again. And onana omg !!! Get on the plane bk to where ever you came from mate !! Yr done . Got to be one if not the worst goalie we’ve ever had EVER!!!!!
13th🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's shame to u for not saying that this Coach has No plan B hopeless coach period
Dont get it how mark can give anyone a 5
Our great club died the day Qatar lost the bid to buy the club.
Onana is done !! He’s made so so many mistakes. Got to be taken out off the side . We ain’t getting better as a team . We will be fighting a relagation next season for sure at this rate . Ineos won’t buy anyone this month either !!
A while back we said onana..box office!yes definitely that😂
Mazroui was SHOCKING, Onana too, Dalot is so poor defensively
Mark, you really need to stop exaggerating and rantings just to make your show. Man U had a bad game! Yes we know that but so have other clubs. Newcastle lost by a big margin but it’s doesn’t mean the end! It’s just a work in progress. Trust the process and stop your knee jerk reactions. It’s getting a little too much these days!!!
The passion in that Carragher impression, love it
Kick Onana out,PLEASE
Cant believe people are still blaming the manager for the shower of shite we have playing
For all i know  Goldbridge ...you a load of bull bro.  This was a good set of players signed ..from the last transfer window  But your manager cant get the best of them
Onana is done !! He’s made so so many mistakes. Got to be taken out off the side . We ain’t getting better as a team . We will be fighting a relagation next season for sure at this rate . Ineos won’t buy anyone this month either !!
Oh the Carra impersonation. 😂❤
agree with all you say here
Every player is the problem , I'm just tired 😢
Ive said it for the last few years, you could bring Pep in and he would win eff all with this team.
£55m for Onana 😂
People acting like Onana was the reason they lost 😂
Kellaher from Limerick for 30 million 10 times a better keeper..☘️☘️
Bring back Ten hag 😂
Football is a business and not a sport anymore.
Its still rashford who yall gonna blame now
Mark pred utd to win 2nil..you set yourself up for a fall buddy😂
Free amass and malacia
This Onana image has to be removed its annoying looking at his smiling face
So Ten Hag was the problem?
Dont cry now city wanted him lol
Man Utds summer transfer window should start in January and finish in the summer. Buy 6 players now and another 6 in the summer.
Amorim is the man to take us forward .
Not sure I'm supporting united if this bollix continues from Ineos.
Yoro looks like he gonna be 💩
Legends at Man Utd get statues made of them around the ground. Onana has fastracked this process and decided to become one himself
Losing isn’t the problem ….it’s how we lose, how we perform, the lack of everything required to play for this club! It’s absolute madness
Im sure i read somewhere when ineos first got involved in all this about there being reserves of natural resources under the trafford area. If thats the case (and id need to do some digging to make sure i didnt dream it) then everything makes sense
Hi mark, They haven’t kicked on from the good performance with Liverpool.
Amorín out !!!
AMORIM OUT
Everton should have 20pts deducted for ETHs decision to sign Onana and Antony.
Stop crying. Support leeds United
How long before the ‘We are Manchester United’ caveat doesn’t hold any weight
🔴🔴🔴⚪️⚪️⚫️ GGMU ⚫️⚪️⚪️🔴🔴🔴
They were terrible today. But I will say ref is giving us no 50/50 calls at moment. And we get yellow cards for fun
Just realizing the  mistake?..I remember " oh ohnanh the best gk in series a"it was disgusting another aajax player
So basically nothing to play for until August (next season) apart from FA Cup and Europa.. how exciting..
I hear Sean Dyche is available 😂🤣
Manure the clowns 🤡 club!
INEOS OUT
Just to be clear: INEOS doesn't know what they're doing, and they showed it at Nice. The Glazers know EXACTLY what they're doing tho. Draining the club for their own profit.
How the fck can you win anything with a crud keeper.
This bloke hasn't a clue about football,!
All of you were talking like Utd showed a masterclass at Anfield and the Emirates. Now their coach is giving pressers saying they r the worst team in the club’s history
lmaoo you red devils never learn from your issues
The biggest problem Mark is that Amorim should change system, all visiting teams put 4-5 midfielders against our two midfielders. You cant create chances with two midfielders. Put creative midfielders in the middle
Next up Glasgow Rangers
Brighton are much better than .man utd
Dude your gonna give yourself an aneurysm! It's ok,....it's ok
Big Maguire still chugging about at the back 😂 and hes not even the worst one 😂😂
Ralf ragnick was right…..
O na na na nah🤣butter fingers🤣
On the plus side, the tickets in the Championship are cheaper 😂
Sign a petition to bring back eth or somthin'. Atleast you'll finish 8th 😂😂😂
Change formation or amorim not lasting the season😂😂
I wish they gave this man united coaching Job to Owen hagreaves. Since he knows how to run his mouth..
Sick of this constantly passing the blame
Dalot has played 30 games this season and only has 2 assists how is this guy still getting game time
Well going by your argument Amorim should quit if INEOS won’t give him what he wants.  A better proposition would be if he is unwilling to leave and INEOS isn’t going to help bring in new players why not change formation? I’m sure he wasn’t taught only 3-5-2 in coaching school.  As a short term measure try something else. You can revert to your system in the summer when you have new players.
Ineos+Glazers= Relegation team
Mainoo been as been found out done nothing this season to slow for the premier league
The less successful we are, the more it hits our owners in the pocket, and the sooner they'll be gone. I can't believe that I'm thinking like this, but is this the only way to eventually get back to the top table?
The manager keeps playing a goalkeeper that is at fault to an average of two goals conceded per game.
Glad I fell asleep before it fell apart
Mark dont be a hypocrite. Your one of the youtubers who supported eth and his sht signings. Now your complaining? Come on.
Just play Amad and Amass at wing back, how much worse can it get?
I thought we were on a small little victory run. I was very wrong 😢 Onana out. Why does he need to always try and do the most as well as making so many stupid mistakes which cost us games as well. The issue is in midfield and the full backs. We need runners, players that know how to play the new system. Most of these players aren't good enough.
The worest MU team i have seen. None of the players are good enough for MU. Remove all of them
People need to understand that regular people have lost their jobs over this, and for what? What has changed?, we've got players on hundreds of thousands of pounds a WEEK that are only dragging us down, and owners who couldn't care less how far we fall, it's time we take a stand and get them all out, enough is enough, we can no longer go on like this.
Man U are a brand first, a football club second.  Also there's a reason Rashford, Casemiro and Anthony are still at the club
Reuben Amorim should be sacked, useless coach that's clueless!!!!
Only way to judge who's good enough is ask yourself which of these players could get in a liverpool team. Amad only & he'll be possibly on the bench because what they've already got in that position
I have seen our fans support mediocrity time after time. Onana performa well he become the main guy, because they dont watch him properly. Now they want maguire to stay then start crying next season when he starts putting in og!!  Rashford performs well they said renew his contract now they are crying. Most of our fans dont actually know football and just go with the flow.
Paddy McCrerand? Seriously??????? There are mistakes, and there are MISTAKES!
idc if were going to be sitting at mid table for the next three seasons, i stand behind amorim, the problems arent the managers, but the clubs and players.
Yoro the new saliba 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
José In!
ETH lost his job playing a back 4 with these players....we could play a back 10 and still find a way to lose
Like spurs you have took a manager from a weak league and expected them to perform in the best league in the world never gonna happen
This has BRIGHTON up my day
Reality returns!! Forget the hype !! The players are not good enough !!
PSR exists, cant spend your way out of it.  Truly great managers transform teams like Emery at Villa, looked shocking under Gerrard, transformed overnight when he arrived. Not seeing much transformation under your new manager.
Rubin amorim probably waiting for the sack to get his contract paid up  Cant blame him
Our most creative player was the ref 😂😂
We are now back to our regularly scheduled programming, "Days Of Our Red Devils".
Them players were an absolute disgrace today.
Is there any chance we sell garnacho and buy mitoma
INEOS/GLAZERS   OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT, OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ragnik was prophetic
They got slated at the time, but maybe the fans who would’ve kicked off the most are the ones who left when the Glazers turned up. United died the day the Glazers took over. You know that Mark, sad as it is to say!
Garna is another player to hyped
Is it
7 first team players with no PL experience
We never get "Manchester United in crisis"
I don't even like football, but I when I hear that Man Utd lose, I'm on here like a flash.
Feel sorry for Amorim, hardest part about this team, is you end up loving the players regardless of the fact they are not good enough to be a top 4 side team, Onana, Maguire, Dalot midfield needs someone better, attack is just toothless, but I like all the players, and see potential in the team, but the results just don’t lie. They are not good enough, and the young guys need people to look up to, clearly can’t be the starters, despite their talent
Getting rid of Mctominay and Fred doomed this club
9:10 yes, abandon it to get temporary results. Or would you rather be relegated. Terrible take
Elanga was brilliant for forest again today ,£15 million and antony on the other hand ?
This is Football Heritage!
Mainoo should never play as 6 mate he is not defensive minded enough
Wake up already the glazers own de club ineos are just a glorified ceo
The fact that Amorim  left Sporting  during one of the best season start  is unbelievable, it make me think the guy isn't that smart.  He could  have probably challenged even for the  Champions League title
I think players need rest and more rotation . Probleme bot enough good player to rotate . So the good one are over worked
You guys kicked out Donny Van de beek and now you all see how useful he wouldve been now playing for United
Brilliant accents Mark  from scouser to brummie in one sentence. Top Lad😂
Man's been saying hes comming to the end of his tether with utd for the last 5 years. Long tether.
Just cross the ball into the box instead of always dribling inside and shooting.
TEN HAG MUST HAVE ENGAGED IN DIRTY DEALS ON ONANA AND ANTHONY
Enough is enough now with Onana
Amorim has made Utd worse
Hopefully short term pain, long term gain. We couldn’t carry on as we have been.
If Amorim goes, I would take a break from United..he was offered a job and forced to take it mid season, inherited a squad of players who have no football IQ or heart...and all of this on top of united knowing he has a system that he will not be moved on..and expect him to find a way to get them to play it without any time on training pitch...Fergie underperformed at first but he knew a culture shift was needed..Ruben knows this as well
Also it core always be the players cus we habe failed n been a load of spunk for years Mourinho was our best since fergie n all he did was park bus up at the depo its being run for cash the club is a cash cow for dem greedy yanks
Basically Onana is rubbish.
Amorin out! Sack him. :)
Take a look at Redcafe. Amorin out has already started for many smart asses  😂 Oh and they want Rashford back as a CF
UTD IN THE MUD 😁😁😁😁😁
When you look at the games Utd have in April/May, they are in trouble.
The club should has been sold to Qatar
GLAZERS OUT 🫵🏽🤬
I am devastated at Man U losses. The whole team needs to be overhauled and the team owners have to set up higher standards for all the players.
Ineos Just give Mark Goldbrigde a consultancy role, with infinite power......2yrs only
Clubs rotten top to bottom. We are a disgrace to our history
Tbf mark i day think we was dat bad erros cost us onana has mistake written all over him everytime hes out ther butter fingers
Onana is the worst gk ever
Are Man United going to buy anyone
Player rating is useless. The team ties or loses everyone gets low score and when the team wins everyone gets a high score.
Hugely entertaining!
Dalot hate kinda getting forced now
Poor old Amorim -  his reputation in tatters , trying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. Truly awful. Denis Law would be ashamed
Heading for relegation
I am sorry to say this, but the only way to reset thia football club, is to completely fall from grace and get relegated. If we struggle in the championship, this might force the Glazers and INEOS to jump ship. God i hope so.
Ineos are IDIOTS!!
Amorim out
absolutely stupid. Ineos are smart to not sign anything this winter. Better to get rid of deadweight, play the season to the end (maybe some youth players can surprise) and then buy cheap players in summer that actually work in Amorim's system. We can't get back into the mindset of "Let's buy every player that's too old for Real Madrid"
Comedy gold. 😊
Maybe today at least leads to us getting something done until end of January
I was at the game we was shocking , Just pas the ball out to the right and give Amed a touch.
😂Rats infestation is not the problem 15:19
Ole In
Bad decision-making  is a key in Manchester United
Onana has always been rubbish!
Should have kept Ruud
its scary how Ineos are not even making a move, 2wks into the January transfer window, like even having a bid rejected! thats worrying,  Sir Jim bought this club wanting it to go back to the "glory days", he surely had a plan, right? If not, just GET OUT!!!!!,   Lets trust the process with Amorim tho,
Ratcliffe is a bacon looking fool
We need to change the system to 5-5-3 to avoid relegation
We were surprised when Ineos got Amorim. We all thought we would stick with Ruud until the summer. But then we see that Ineos will likely not sign anyone in January. So, what was the plan from the beginning? Same old story. We will keep dropping points. There's still a long way to go.
Buy players in the summer lol we'll see
Some players are over ipe  in Manchester United, and Manchester United is giving contracts to players that are not good enough for that contract
😊😊
Onana was brought in by ETH. He also let the last one go for free
Mark's opinion on ugarte is ridiculous. He is bang average in possession
Jamie carager 😂😂😂
Nobody wants those players you've listed off as not part of plans
START THE PROTESTS AGAIN INEOS GLAZERS OUT
We're absolutely fucked,we're going to loose sponsors  causing the value of the club  to go down and into more debt,which means selling more of our best players so we can survive.
ManU once again never disappoints 😂😂😂 Never change!
Just need 4 more wins to survive. We can do it.
Hojlund, mount, onana & antony cost 250m thats a joke, if he sold them all now we'd be lucky to get back 80m in total
After the Liverpool and Arsenal games ,  fans were saying 'Man U' are back. Mark mentions a lot of valid points, there needs to be a complete overhaul-starting from the top!
Our regular keeper is struggling. Another keeper did very well against Arsenal and he's immediately dropped! What's going on? It's very disappointing, I thought we had turned a corner.
Did you see Yoro fronting up Marsh at the end? Clear as daylight this young talent regrets joining us and how can you blame him
INEOS need to ACT or LEAVE.
THE MAIN PROBLEM ARE THE MATCH GOING FANS PERIOD. JUST DONT GO TO THE GAMES AND THE GLAZERS WILL LEAVE. SIMPLE.
Ineos it is not a cycling team, but a football club, IT'S not the same 😞
Sky Sports always does 12 hour of Man United Propaganda every day but surprisingly, you'll Never heard about not having Left Back, Glazers and even INEOS. They will show you load of charts and graphs of Man United spending on transfers but they WON'T do a Show on Glazers and INEOS. ABSOLUTELY FUXCKING HYPOCRITE MEDIA
I wish I can join David degea in his laughing room 🤣🤣, onana is ridiculously a joke. 😂😂
Onana's picture in the ratings column. 😂
That Liverpool game was United’s Cup Final 💀
Imagion we listened to Jose ... and backed him ... or even listened to Ragnick and bought the players he put out there  .... but like Mark said ... same crap starts from up top .... it will not change while we have the Glazers in this club End Of
Maguire  slow     onano  awful worse  team ever
Mark, you wanted Onana.
Bull sheet scode, imagine dalot from suspension to begin
What are you talking about left back? 3 5 2  makes sense with no left back. You don't need left back stop talking left back; think you should be left back.
Good way send Mr Law off ... RIP ..  This team is a Joke !!
Player ratings 5 and 6 never in a million years more like 2s and 3s
Enough! How can a team go from finishing 3rd,going well in a European comp,FA Cup finalists and League Cup winners in 1season to now looking over their shoulders???? How long can they stay in this position with the back end of this season looming? They have got to make some adjustments very soon,a couple of tweaks here and there surely.P.D.W
A joke of a football club. Serves them right. Instead of honouring the loss of an all-time great in Law, they quibble about signings and overpaid hype jobs. A joke of a club.
Moyes was the problem.  Van Gaal was the problem.  Mourinho was the problem.  Solskjaer was the problem.  Rangnick was the problem.  Ten Hag was the problem.  Amorim is the problem.  Repeat.
But no one will buy these terrible players that’s why Utd are struggling with the January transfer
Relagation...the only decent performance was against Liverpool...lucky in the other wins.
United has to learn how to perches  only gossip look PSG they need a player they go and sign with no lots of gossip or screaming
Reality is no one wants our crap player. They are crap and on huge wages.
If I was amorim id leave
As a City supporter I'm loving it!
Oh look who,s just crept into 4 th place??? Ya never know, ya never know!!!!!🩵🩵🩵🩵
Mainoo aint ready yet, need a world class no 8 to play next Ugarte, new LB, keeper and experienced striker and maybe left side no 10
Ineos and the Glazers have to go out!
United are not relevant to the modern game.  Brighton are.  Brighton are run like a modern team, buy like a modern team, managed like a modern team and play like a modern team.
‘Sir’ Jim is a tax dodger and libertarian. He was never the answer
What’s really ineos plan when they brought Amorim ? It’s rally hard to think united will win a game
Sack the coach he’s not good enough 😂😂😂😂😂
Id say get rid of shaw and mount asap too but who wd want them
Amorims’s comments after the match …. 🔥 I back this manager 100%
Hahahahahaha it was all the fault of the bald Dutchman!!!!!!
We need ineos and the glazers out and that will only happen if we get relegated the club will lose value their super league dreams will be gone no businessmen will attempt to buy us and proper owners will come in and the club will heal and that is probably what qatar are waiting for
These managers nowadays
What happened to the most inform club in Europe?😂
It has nothing to do with who’s the manager
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Elanga sancho mct all punted doing well now
Sorry to say Mark we will be saying the same thing 5 years from NOW !!!!!!
Buy players ? Apart from like ine or two the rest are all shite,1 billion needs to be spent
Mark, there is nothing that you or any supporter can do. Nothing.
MU suporters its time to do something 💪💪💪 Im not in England but ask to all the real MU suporters, to send a strong message to the owners 🧐 we are MU not the owners 💪💪💪💪💪
Onana goalkeeping imposter....
Meanwhile mct is scoring and going for title
Without amad they wd be beside ruud
I have a theory, Ratcliff and Co. were there for the game against Southampton purely for PR. Bottom of the league side, united would surely win so let's go to OT psychologically attaching the feel good factor from fans to us when people see our faces on the screens. But today, on tribute game to Denise Law they are no where to be seen. Cause they knew we'd probably get battered and the cameras would be on them.
I told you guys the win at Southampton was a fluke you guys didn’t believe me. That match was a draw or a loss. Amorim was a scam, nothing different from Ten Hag. We are not creative or organized, kick and follow.
So guys who are the deadwood now? Most aren’t first team plus we gave Bruno and Maguire new contracts
Play the kids
RIP DENIS LAW. Long live tĥe king. Gone but never will be forgotten
Ten Hag won 2 cups with these players!
Ratty is glazer patsy
Look dalot how slow he was
MANCHESTER U-SHYTE-D
There are not MU players, dont feel the shirt and just dont care. In the start of the game, not even one player go to Sir Alex Ferguson and he look 😵‍💫😐 its nothing but... No respect and still, they are the best of all times 🧐 😵‍💫 congrats 🧐😵‍💫
And. Speaking about not playing a back 4 and parking the bus, you're playing a back 5 under Amorim and scoring on the break!! Joker.
😂😂😂
You should have an embargo on your show to not say the word Rashford for 24 hours'.....
Ask any manager if it is possible to take over a new team and implement a completely new system mid-season in the hardest league in the world. I bet you most if not all will say it is impossible. This is what glineos wanted Amorim to do and guess what, it dosent work.
The day the GLAZER'S bought our club was the day we died
they panicked to get Amorim cos “city will get him” .. this time next year we will be the same spot cos they won’t fix everything in the summer .. then they sack him to save themselves
Bayindir should become first choice goalkeeper 💯💪💯
If rashford played today the result would have been different. One dimensional attack, he would’ve added something different. Facts 🤷🏼‍♂️
How much more can we as fans take. Im sick to the bottom of my stomach
I’m so fed up with the decision being made at the top of this club it’s ridiculous and I can’t see a future for this club until we have been completely bought out by someone who knows how to run this club and not as a business
Manchester United HAVE TO PLAY FOUR ACROSS THE BACK!!!!! Rocket science be fucked!
Remember the days when the best players in the prem got snapped up by united,  now we just buy young talent with no experience and keep them
This will not happen in reality but now Amorim has an idea about this squad, it will be better to send him back to sporting until summer and for the time period appoint Sean Dyche , keep Rashford and Casemiro for the time being and lets gets some points and then have Amorim back and have a clear out in the summer.  We are not going to win games playing positional football with this squad.
United’s player policy is buy high sell cheap.
Ruben "it's not my fault" Amorim? Get a grip! Good managers make their squad work short term and improve as time and budget allow... .
We had all five signings of this season playing. So, do we remove all players on the field? Can't blame the one's not playing
as soon u take martinez out nobody defends with attitude.. this is not how u defend in high competition in any sport ! its not complicated "the system " its the same system southampton plays.. everybody play the "system" except this idiots !! i've never seen a team this bad individualy dueling ! its insane , permanent distracted ? is that it ? zero evolution ! they still dont understand they have to cover the players ? specially two ,the one with the ball back passing it and the ones receiving it ! how is it possible ? they dont run AT ALL .. u tAKE the one more active , the one that should really be the captain MARTINEZ , is the only one trying to do what is asked... pay attention , cover your man at all moments of the game and be competitive ... they get one day off , any of them , immediately reset to this.. walking around the field as if isn't them playing .. take the captain thing out of fernandes QUICKLY
Bring Back Marcus Rashford......this formation don't work in English's Super lige
The choices before United are crystal clear. Continue with Amorim’s style of play with the current set of players and suffer endlessly; or back him in the transfer market with his type of players. Otherwise, do nothing and hope to escape relegation.
Remember Nark, before Radcliff took over he met the Glazers and said, they are good people!
Ten hag is statically better he came when it was a shambles just like ashworth , morinio , ragnik
Why don’t you blame Ten Hag for buying these bad players
9:45 thats the best analogy i have ever heard in my entire life
Ruben at the wheel at the wheel. Ruben's at the wheel
Hojlund qnd garnacho fc saying he doesn't do player fc😂😂😂 🤡🤡
To be fair. It worked better under Ten Hag. Not much better, but better
One trick pony with his formation, he can’t adapt. If he currently doesn’t have the players to suit his formation then maybe change it up to make things work for now until you do have the players that you want, that’s what you get paid the big bucks for to make it work with what you’ve got. No point just lying down for teams and waiting for the summer admitting defeat along the way. Also can’t just expect to just spunk 300m when the clubs in debt.
With that squad we are going nowhere
Going down
Mark you are a legend. Make a business model of your own misery 😂
If onana isn’t shipped out this summer, we know that decisions are being forced on Amorim.
Spot on Mark, GLAZERS ineos, lets put it how it is
So basically you finally ran out of luck and you’re still absolutely dogshit and going nowhere.   Stay humble.
How can mark say the players are playing too much football.. look at the youngsters at clubs like Barca. They Play almost every game for club and country. They’re also the best players for both.
When they got rid of ashworth I knew it was a shambles
Amorim to resign and take the Man City job
6:30  But I remember Mark saying that Amorim inherited the best sqaud compared to any other manager after Fergie!
You saw Robo's face when the camera went on him
Casemiro, Rashford , and Antony earn more in a week that Denis Law earned in his entire career.
The Moyes is back in town and he's hunting you's down COYB 😂😂
When onana first came he kept leaving his line and kept getting chipped and he changed what he was meant to be. He’s the only entertaining player we have so that’s one thing he’s got
Stop buying merchandise and tickets that's the only way to get ri of these owners
Onana is not a premier league goalkeeper. A show pony. This team is clueless and spineless. Can’t score, don’t want to defend
Fortunately for United the bottom three lost, and other results went our way allowing United to maintain a solid grip on 13th place...could have been worse.
United are now a mid table team, ❤
These so called fans are losing the plot. Wheres Glazers out? Wheres INEOS out? Man Utd fans are ball-less cowards
but  but but you beat arsenal on penalties
Amad is here!!!! Best player in EPL😂😂😂
I’m loving it❤❤❤❤
We didnt create chances on the ball under Ole. We didnt create chances on the ball under Erik. And we arent creating chances on the ball under Amorim . And we wont be creating chances on the ball whoever the next manager will be. These fans need to sit down and be humble
Ineos useless.
Ratcliffe is another Glazer, what ever sport he touches he destroys. Just look at Nice and the Sky cycling team. It’s all about running the club as a business and not a football club. I agree with other comments, our only salvation was Qatar buying us but Ratcliffe stopped that from happening
Slot couldnt even fix this
Get the second choice keeper in immediately. He was fantastic in the cup game. Drop Onana. Let's be honest, he's been rubbish apart from some good reflex saves buf otherwise he's a disaster. After that cup game the other keeper should have started
Another prat 😂
Ticket prices are progressing
Was so bad he thought they were playing Brentford 🤣🤣
Mark Goldbridge, summer we get players 👍 Are you think we get many players in january. Nope we don't get
Didn't  take long. "Wer'e Manchester United ". Alway's the same with United fan's,as if your something special,above every other club.Let's not pretend they have always been a powerhouse of english football.Most of their success came from a legendary manager.Before Fergie Everton had more title's."Wer'e Manchester United ". Pathetic.
This football club is a fucking joke! I don't blame Amorim, I believe in his ability but these players are not good enough. Almost everybody needs to go, Ineos see whtat's going on but does nothing. It hurts my soul, we are getting battered by everybody. And btw, Onana, my dead granny could collect that easy ball. Get out!
Stop giving a 5 to everyone you chicken
Two class goals from Brighton and one gift from the disaster artist Onana.
I will totally write off the actual season! This is actually the end result of a wonderful team a most winning team in the past destroyed by  people who bought it purely for their own benefit without having any knowledge about football! Glazers please sell the club in full and move your funds somewhere else!
You can’t force fullbacks to be wingers and wingers to be defenders. Wait for new players & then try the new formation.
In germany we say Konstant unkonstant. 😂😂
Onana must go
The whole team is shite all of them bar amad is garbage . Just accept it .
You can’t changed a system when the team is poor. The problem with the three man defense system is that lack of communication amongst the back three and midfield which may creates situations of out of positions in which opponents could exploit and it is happening. The team is poor and does not master the system and that is why teams exploits.
I wasn't getting drawn into the hype after the Arsenal win
Thought the Southampton game was lucky Southampton was the better side apart from the finishing
Glazers > Sir Jim (control freak)
Why didn't United buy Rutter from Leeds? Best player on the pitch today.
Reality check:   Liverpool were rubbish and so were Arsenal.
Guys are ugarte and mainoo good players ??
Ten's signings got united here.
Wonder how many points Onana has cost us this season
Sticking rigidly to plans/system can lead to chaos when circumstances change. Leaders (coach/manager) must recognize when to adapt their strategies to maintain effectiveness. Awareness of the current situation and avoiding impossible commands prevent team paralysis and create opportunities for growth and success. Adaptability is a strategic advantage that can turn the tide in your favor. "Sun Tzu's Art of War"
Ineos shud sell t club to the qatarian
Hahaha, great "manc" SCOUSE accent Mark 4:00....Sad, Nottinlgham glory hunter cant even do the clubs genuine fans accent😂
This. Is. Football. Heritage.
Only one man that can create chances in United, and he is benched and will soon leave. Eriksen has been the best and most stabil player this season. I know Bruno and Amad has some peaks, but player of the year is ERIKSEN imo. And Amorim do no use him.
Mark doesn’t want a fire sale, but wants better players. We need a fire sale you prat!!
The cash has dried up!
Amorim is a crap coach. He is very dislikable.
They should all be ashamed of themselves absolute shower of shite the lot of em.. play the under 21s or under 18s even they will show more passion than these muppets I'm actually embarrassed   to support em at the minute worst team in utds history fact
Any person that is blaming Amorim does not know anything about football! He is the right man to turn United around but it is going to take time and patience!
I could play De Ligt's game, pass to the left, pass to my right and pass back to the goalkeeper. Sorted!
Enough with the player ratings....give them all a big fat 0 !...how many games are we going to lose at this rate?  Sick and tired of this team and the way this club has been run for the last 10 years.
Great show mark.   When will we wake up that the only solution to restoring this club is GLAZERS OUT ! INEOS OUT!    Latest legend farewell match they ruin with the way they’ve destroyed this club. 😢
They should have just sold the club to Saudi I think we would have been better off, the  Glazers and Ineos should just sell the club the literaraly don't care about the club and the fans all they care about is there pockets
No clue
Players with no clue
For united and Amorim to service  they have to sign at least six players just to servive to wil the trophy all played has to go away and Amorim has to sign his own players
All you muppets who thought Bruno was back and we were making progress.  We are rotten and have no mentality.
Forget manager ,players are bad 👎
Turned more corners than Pac-Man
forget our bad attackers,spend weeks working on defence
I used to be a left back….in the changies I was shite at footy,worse than the fat kid with the asthma.
please spend weeks and weeks working on defence
Sack the manager! We were better with Ten Hag
So do you think we get january even one player 😏
This loss was a long time coming
blew your load against Arsenal in FA cup
Let me say this Ineos will want to leave after the new stadium is built and man Utd would be in decades long lease to a subsidiary of Glazier+ Ineos. It was always the plan…for those who say it can’t happened remember Glazier bought us with our own debt and city funds itself with their subsidies. Lots can happen in big corporations and this is an easy work around.
Shameful and shameless players. We’ve seen in all before a cycle of failures. I feel bad for Amorim.
Let’s stop sitting around moaning and start demonstrating.  If we do nothing, nothing will change.
the glazers and ineos burnt this club they just need to leave
This job won't affect Amorims career. Anyone who is anyone in world football can see the rubbish he's having to work with.
I think that Amorim is the way to go but you need to get rid of the losers in the team. It's sad to see your club crawl in the mud.
Done with these clowns, can't watch it anymore. Current ownership will take us down to the Championship. See you all next season.
LETS GET OUT OF THE MISERY AND GO DOWN TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP.
The big problem is the Glazers are so removed from Manchester.
Guys can we cut the crap.  We are playing a flat back 5 with 2 midfielders 2, 10s and one forward.  We are being overrun every week in midfield and we have zero width.  If I were told before he came that we would be playing a flat back 5 and only 2 midfielders in this league I would have said no thank you
I said ten years ago the fans have to stop going to matches and buying the£3 Chinese made football shirts for £50. Do this and we get rid of the glazers and the other leech Jimmy.
No it’s the glazers fault again 😂😂😂
Manchester United reminds me of the UK & Western Europe, like the frog sitting in warm water, you need to get loud and vote for change.
I think Amorim got a 2.5 year contract so if he can’t pull a rabbit out of the hat then they can sack and it will be cheaper and it will deflect from the ownership being useless again and if he does well then win win.
Kick out Onana buy martinez
United always get bummed by Brighton.
United are Back. Congratulations on winning the We drew at Anfield Trophy. 😂😂😂
No excuses for sloppy defending and just one shot on target, which was a penalty.  Amorim is a shambles!
gRIM!
Great tribute to Dennis Law.Thank God he didnt play with this shower of shite.We fluked it against Southampton after they played us off the park but  not today .Cant get my head round the cost of this squad and how terrible we are .Dark days and more to come no doubt.
The players don’t know who Denis Law is. They don’t care. They are imports who are cashing in on the club’s name. Same as the owners
The amount of Tottenham and man united fans giving it online about arsenal’s draw last night😂
The fact Antony has lasted so long speaks volumes, Man Us decline embodied in one player.
its not that fielding Altay would take us further down
Hey Red Devils ….enjoy the losses .you will be relegated for sure
You can’t play 6 defensive players and beg for creativity. I like Amorim, but he’s incapable of adjusting his formation speaks more of him as a manager
United need someone like Navas, like what was Onana doing, playing red light green light?😭😭😭
Let’s stop sitting around moaning and start demonstrating.  If we do nothing nothing will change.
First thing that has to change is scrap Onana. He's the worst keeper I've seen at United in 40 years of supporting them. That's saying something when we had the likes of Taibi and Barthez. But Onana has cost us so many goals and points from stupid individual errors that any keeper would be better right now. And the errors are consistent across both seasons we've had him, so it's not just dips in form. Until we stop goals going in there's no point looking to blame forwards for where we are.
Disgracing Denis Law’s legacy with yet another shite performance like that. Should be ashamed of themselves
United are so much better with Rashford than without!! Rashford doesn’t kick a ball for United for a month and the poor results are all his fault. This channel has turned into The Agenda Stand
Onana sucks!!
Shud have held off with the amorim signing until summer, ineos endless blunders 😂
💯💯 correct
At this point start utilizing the academy players. Force the players out. This club needs an open heart surgery.
Sell Onana for  £2.50 😂😂😂
Im Sporting supporter. Give time to him. Is one of the bests coach. Send most of that lazy players go out
Time for onana to go he's terrible
Onana. Bloody hell 😂. Dude would have survived the great flu. He couldn't catch it
Onana is nowhere the keeper he was at inter, is admourin over his head with this ? What is the problem exactly? Is it the dressing room? Is it the manager? Back room staff? Or is it the board? Where exactly does the problem lie? Will they win anything this season? I think not
I am clueless as to where Man United is heading...
Andre Onana. Another stain left by the bald Dutch fraud.
Amorin shouldn't have taken the job. He hasn't been paying attention clearly. It's a poisoned chalice at the moment.
I really feel sad for Zirkzee he worked his ass off and got no service. I don't understand why we have players that can't even do the basics. Its just pathetic how this club is run. I really think we should hit the owners pocked.Just watch few matches from home everyone we need to get rid of these owners.
Let's say no one comes in this month. Are we really selling half the squad and buying 10 in the summer?
Maguire is a liability. He is not a United caliber player. The longer he stays the more United will lose!!!Simple as that!
Man City drop to 6th then January comes they spend 200m to fix an already insane squad we will fade further and further away if we don’t get billionaire owner immediately
Onana is a disease!
You say you know and consume united yet you keep speculating about January transfer market we're not going to do anything
the glazers and ineos need to leave
Onana has to go
25 years following United I need a new team to support now
Glazers out. The club was failing before ineos and amorim.
Joshua Clumzee. Glazers and Inious out the club is in tatters.
The seagulls have definitely BRIGHTON my mood this weekend.
He was brought in November to work with this 'awful' squad
Mark you’re such a hypocrite. You hounded Scott McT out. Some of the things you said on your live streams about him was a disgrace 😡 But you slate other fans for going after players? 🤔 And i’m sorry, I really like Amorim but if the system isn’t working then you need to change! Ange gets hammered for only having a plan A
You were right mark Brighton do have a better Squad and a better bench. I was worried with the sad passing of Denis Law I thought the team would raise their game all be it temporary.
The manager has to be sacked.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Amorim OUT. 343 does not work.  How many games will INEOS tolerate. This is hurting the club financially, look at the no European football clause with Adidas. Itll be the same with all the other big partnerships. Then theres the lack of TV revenue and matchday revenue.
Onana is a fucking joke!
over achieved today being honest after fluking a win against bottom side southampton. youre never gonna get relegated so best use this season to get practicing for next season
This Utd team is nothing short of a disgrace. Why can they only turn up for games against the big teams? Look at the performances since the draw against Liverpool. They beat Southampton but they were woeful for 75 mins of the game. Southampton were clearly the better team and now spanked at home to another crap team.
FOR GOD SAKE GET RID OF THAT JOKE ONANA ! 👿
Maybe amorims system is perfect for Portugal but not in the most competitive league in the world. And you are asking for trouble if you think you can change the system in the middle of the season. But that’s what we are doing.
Football is a funny old business. In any other industry, if the business owners treated their customer base the way Man Utd do, they would stop purchasing their goods and services. Utd somehow manage to do the opposite. It's the genius of the madness. My business would be lucky to have customers like Man Utd's because I'd know you'd be willing to pay higher prices for a lower level of quality. Read between the lines and make of that what you will.
We need players. We can't rotate or make subs because no one on the bench is able to step in and do a damn thing.   Also, Onana, I'm officially done supporting him. He costs us TOO many games since his arrival.
Back to factory settings
To me this is a season of experiment for Amorim. He’s rotating enough to show case who stays and goes. Who has a good attitude and who doesn’t. I’ve written off the season. No expectations on losses or wins. Only focusing on Amorim’s plan.
Ten hag was doing miracles getting silverware.
The players should be ashamed for not delivering. Man utd players are just over rated
Goldbridge saying Brighton are a mid table team, have you seen the table? United arent even a mid table team, embarrassing. United fans need to get off there high horse & recognise you are bang average, only 2 or 3 of your players would get anywhere near the top half teams & that is just getting into the squad they wouldn't even start for them. The sooner United fans realise they are not a top 6 club anymore the better.
United buys  jokers after jokers 😂😂
You’re not putting us in the relegation zone but you don’t know where the next Win is coming from, hmmm!!
I was one of the few who said NO ONANA!!
They never played that bad. Brighton are a good team. Keeper had a howler tho
Keeper needs to be dropped firstly.
I agree with it not making sense to change the formation, but hard to take from the same guy who constantly rails against other managers refusing to play pragmatically instead of getting their teams to play out of the back...
ipswich bournemouth forest southampton brighton outplayed united, fcking embarassing, sack amorim, sell onana
goldbridge is right, rashford again ruining the club refusing to leave means no signings, onana is a fraud, and mainoo should be sold not garna
Paddy McCrerrand 😭
Man United are trash😂😂😂😂
I feel nothing. Just watching to see how bad it can get at this stage. But in terms of hope and optimism, it's long gone.
Could do with a good sporting director to help in the transfer window, someone like……Dan Ashworth! oh hang on we fucking sacked him. INEOS have never run a successful sports team, trashed team sky and Nice are bang average in a farmers league
One shot on target. As soon as Antony came on we looked dangerous. Whether we like it or not we need Rashford pace upfront. This Zirkzee hold up wont work with bruno running forward. Terrible formation
You all wanted the club to back ETH. We did. We gave him £650m to spend on dross. Now we're maxed out on PSR. Now we need to sell to buy. In fact we need to sell all the players ETH bought. You all wanted this. Now, you all need to put on your big boy pants and accept reality. Buckle up because things are likely to get worse before they get better.
unless this club is sold we are going nowhere I wonder why we are not protesting ???????am worried for amorim he will be gone soon ,sir jim just wanted man united in his portfolio
Amorim is totally clueless. We need to fire him now
Amorim will do well at Arsenal 😊
Onana must go out.😂😂😂😂
We only seem good in a low block and hitting it long. We simply don't have the ability to play out . We don't have an effective forward line .
It starts with having an insight of being a midtable team and Utd is no more big team. Their salary too be comparable with midtable team players.
I m loving it 😂😂😂
I thought Carra was in the room with us
I don't even care anymore mark. I haven't for a while they've knocked all the passion for this club out of me along time ago. Scrubs
Should have kept mctominay. At least the lad played with his heart for the badge. No passion no aggression no pride in wearing that shirt from some of those players. Onana needs to go. Too many errors from him since last season.
What are you on about? This is the best squad we have. You don't want to sell anyone in this team. So who are you pulling out. To put someone new in.
Pride will be Amorims downfall. What do we gain from benching Rashford. That formation clearly doesn't work on certain teams. Every time he brings on Antony our attack comes back to life.
Looking down your nose at Brighton sums Utd up. Thinking they deserve to be at the top but in reality Utd do nothing to actually be towards the top of the league. Need to stop talking about what Utd used to be and realise they are now competing with clubs like Everton and Wolves etc
We have turned so many corners i am dizzy ..
Hard to credit the players today.  Our attack and midfield is crap. Creates nothing. No runs for each other. No surprises and creativity in this squad. Play the Youth and develop. How Can Harry Amass not Play?
blud this is so sad
your a mid table team mark 😂😂
Mainoo is absolutely crap and so overrated
Ineos your a joke sir jim!!!!!
The players have had no time to recover since their heroics last Sunday. They are still knackered from playing more than an hour with 10 men, including half an hour extra time plus penalties . . .
Ineos out!!!!!!!!
Bruno, Dalot and Onana might turn into Amorim's downfall. I would hate to see that happening to Amorim. He must reconsider his stance on them three. While Rashford out (righteously though), them three are the worst performers in the team. Reshaping a failing team usually starts from the Captain.
Amorim out !
People who say amorim out,Your gonna say that about a guy who just came,and got a shite club of players,people like you shouldnt speak because you dont know what you are talking about lol,you can see something with amorim,the way he is talks the way the team plays,what do you expect? That we go on a win streak and clap everyone in our path,our fanbase is truly delusional
Onana is just 😂 Pure comedy. I like Amorim but I don’t see him lasting the season. INEOS are useless and just look completely clueless. This club is just done as a top club.
Really bad decision to not let Amorim stay at Sporting for the rest of the season and let an interim see out the season. Truly short sighted.
Ineos out they’ll get us relegated before they get us a premier league trophy
How can these owners just sit and watch this its slowly got worse and worse over the years they need to go
Glazers Ineos out
DUMBEST CLUB IN THE WORLD with the most delusional supporters....WE love seeing you quilifying for the ChampionnnnnnnnnnSHIP
But you won by drawing against Liverpool and beating the poorest team in the EPL?!
Your goalkeeper Banana has very slippy hands😂
Law rolling in his grave haha
Amad is the only player who’s good enough. Wouldn’t be bothered if the rest were sold. Utter garbage.
Onana out!!!
Actually going to the cinema to watch Nosferatu tonight … now Mark convinced me that Onana will be  the monster 😅😅😅😅
Hahahahaha Manchester United are shite
United are BACK!
When you realize that Amorim is a fraud you'll be in the Championship
Ten hag paid 600 million for bad players and we are now here because of him
Thought they were back after last week's bore fest 😂
Rip denis law
Honestly who are better players for Manchester United in this world
am not going to lie but i hate a back five ,  so now what have achieved by sacking eth , nothing , again wrong timing for  decision like no improvement
Sir Jim = Traitor from within  WORSE than the Glazers
Pathetic performance
Ineos out
Below Palace, going well is it
Onana gets zero tonight
The clowns never fail to entertain..
Ineos out
Fans hold some blame. Ugarte and Mainoo have one good game together and everyone thinks they’re a good partnership. They never have been. Bruno isn’t a 10 or an 8 in this team but again he has one good game and fans say he just needs to be consistent now.
… makes you wonder what path would we be on if Qatar did a full takeover and got rid of the debt and Glazers…
Onana out
Ten Hag has signed Onana and Antony !!!! That’s more than enough to get the sack !!!!
Where are the prats from yesterday attacking Mark for saying there is no service to Hojlund? Did you see Zirkzzi today?  El Moranos = Morons, in Spanish :)
Humbled , again ! Manchester United are the only club that can get humbled this many times , while also having fans that have no sense of what being humble actually is. United fans spent the entirety of the 2022 World Cup complaining about everything in it bcz of who hosted it , and they then begged those exact same hosts to buy their club !
INEOS OUT!
Surely if LFC  fans want to wind up Utd fans they would say Amorim should stay !!!
Is Amoriim actually better than ETH?
This team is overflowing with talentless players....
Onana was like a statue and Ineos out
The Portuguese Trio keeps on failing when playing in the Premier League.
