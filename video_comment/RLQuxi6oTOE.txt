BRJ 😮‍💨I won't ever live this down
Bengals brought their semi pro defense, again.
11:04 will you play the next game whoever guarding you ask him what's your favorite color and say how do you want to change
Super Bowl 2026 preview
If someone told you that by the end of the year one of these teams would be contending for a Super Bowl and one would be just out of the playoffs, you’d think “the commanders really had to exceed expectations to have a chance at the playoffs”
Well i did told my Dad Frank Roberson Social Security For Global Elders

Introducing … the Commanders!!
That 3rd touchdown play was a beautiful throw
5:00 Brian Robinson jr. doing squabble up had me cracking up 😂
We should check out Nick chubb 🤔
What a game
HTTC
I wasn't feeling Daniels until this game... I don't watch alot of College
.
Viscous Demantlling
can’t wait for football szn
This was the game that got the season going for the Commanders. I can’t wait to see how we are going to play this year😉😉
Commanders are gonna be scary next year, this is a fresh new team that made it to the nfc championship game
10:47 was pi
@NFL PLEASE upload this full game
JD5 wanted to beat Joe B. in this match up. 👍🏾
That brief moment when Trent Scott was our receiving TDs leader was awesome lol
Man what a game and win by the Commanders!! The game that defined Jayden Daniels rookie season, Jayden absolutely played the best, phenomenal performance. He’s going to be a massive star for the NFL. 👏👏👏👏👏👏⭐️
The game we started to stand out 🔥
Checking in from 2025 NFC conference game.  Skins fan, WE GOT US ONE.
I watched this game fully, then got brutally sick because of lack of sleep (and yes I was only sleeping like 1 hour every night for 2 weeks before).... Totally worth it 😂😂
HTTR/c!!!!!!!
I told you i would come back!! LETS GO!!!!!  HTTR!!!   One More Game!! OUR TIME!!!!
Who’s here after a game wining drive against the lions at the divisional round
Came here after Tampa Game.   Ill be back after Detroit.
this was a slaughter
I wonder what brown whispered to him it look like it stuck with Daniels
I think this is when we first turned into the commanders!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Those 2 teams will be in the super bowl
I dont think a lot of ppl realize how well burrow played today even though jaden player just as good if not better
McLaurin gives me flashbacks of Gary Clark with those over the shoulder catches.
Bengals become joe burrow. We chase young. But know we have jayden 🥰🥰🥰
Jayden Daniels is a once in a lifetime QB. Book it.
I’m back cause this where it all started
Excellent performance by both the defense and the offense of the Commanders.
They are the best ones and also Jayden Daniels is to that hail Mary he threw Noah brown caught it also he is the goat
Terry is like that and Austin Ekleer Brian Robinson Jermey
Commanders
Jayden Daniel’s is like that he’ll never leave the commanser
This was when the legend started
This was the signature win that really got the Commanders rolling....
This is the game that will live in Washington football history.
What can I do to make video better.
now that I'm looking at this game I can see the Bengals wasn't prepared for Jayden Daniels. You can tell they didn't really know his skill set. To many times I seen defensive players out of position and thats because they didn't know he can make these plays. We will see what happens when there becomes more tape on him and Commanders scheme.
8:28 sorry but that wasn't a touchdown...
Camera man face at 11:57 😳
Commanders need to tear up his contract and sign this man to a big extension
Miller Thomas Lewis Ronald Rodriguez Christopher
Commander are da best team ever
And they say Joe burrow was the best to come from LSU
As a QB how tf do you even see that throw ? Like what I wouldve threw the ball way tf off 😭😭 11:26
Taylor Sandra Harris Thomas Martinez Michael
THAT DEFENSE better get it looking like a D Q defense
Not in a million years would I thought the Washington team would actually get 2.3 million views and 3,7.K comments.😂
That's what the Lions did last year against the Cowboys but it didn't count. Did Trent Scott let the Ref know before the play that he was Eligible? Who keeps the Ball? It was Trent Scott's first touchdown and Jaydem Daniel's first touchdown.
Washington finally got their QB the future looks bright for that organization
Jayden is poised, young, and has room to learn. Great pick.
Thompson Shirley Robinson Melissa Thomas Shirley
Unpopular opinion…. Joe Buck is wayyyy better calling games now.

Commanders gonna be a problen this year
Willy Port
Finally excited as a Washington fan about our future. Not jumping the gun but new ownership means no more Synder. I miss RG3 though we ruined his career that 2012 is my favorite as a Washington fan ever.
11:55 best part the cameraman behind the catches reaction

Lets not over look that black by the rb on the terry td
Most impressive part was how smooth and quickly Daniel’s went through his progressions
6:00
stay focused yall might have to go ss1 against az sunday #hail
120 Murphy Place
Daniels good, but Bengals d even better at being horrible. Couldn't stop either rb and gave Daniels crazy time to throw.
Bengals cant do anything.
I love how Burrow wasn’t afraid to block on that one play this was honestly a great game absolute nail biter great drives from both sides hope our Bengals can pick up a win next game WHO DEY!
The Football Team looks pretty good.
Allison Common
2 LSU heismen winners going at it. love our LSU talent
Wow - awesome Game 😍 🎉 from both teams
Texans fan here . Always liked the commanders for some reason though . They got a good QB reminds me of Stroud .. good luck to y'all's team .
I know our defensive line isnt helping much but our corners are getting burnt. Switch dj turner and dax
Anyone else think CTB would be a great safety?
With all the hype on Caleb but i had a feeling that Jaden would come out to be the best QB of this class and this game shows it
It's great to see another young talented QB doing his thing, Daniels was outstanding Washington's future looks bright.
I truly believe that if Jayden Daniels can beat Burrow and the bengals so can the panthers and Dalton 🤞
Jayden Daniels balling out like he did at LSU, love to see a Heisman winner playing this well in his rookie year!
Bryce Young a bust
Joe Burrow is 0-3 as lesbian version Eminem
This is  the year of comeback quarterbacks, some that doubt them and written them off. Some just got better with a good coaching fit on different teams.Some give them time, but others' learning and development.
Augustine Gardens
Stay healthy, stay driven, Jayden Daniels, and you might become a star; you're already beginning to look like it.
JD5, don't have a cannon for a arm, he has a d@mn laser for one ( HTTR, HTTC'S)
Sorry that wasn’t a td by the te
Daniel had a breakout game with this one a 91% completion rate is crazy and that last pass was crazy 😲🔥
If I had a nickel for every time I've seen the Bengals lose an offensive shootout at home to a team with a rookie QB, I'd have two nickels. Weird that it's happened twice.
Y'know, after last year I got pretty used to seeing Robinson find that extra gear, that thinnest gap to squeeze through and tank out a couple extra yards. Nice to see with Ekler in town we have multiple guys that can do it now.
Washington finally got themselves a QB1
Great game, some great throws and finishes from both teams.  Fun offensive game.
No turnovers & no punts!?! That is absolutely amazing! What a clean & gutsy game played by both teams especially tha young Daniels
49er Faithful (and won't play either team this season).  Heard so much about Jayden Daniels' game, had to come watch this.  Yeah - terrific.  Congratulations, Commanders.  Your team looks solid.  And heard that Burrows was sucking this season.  Not true!  He also looked great.  Glad to see that, too.  Great game.  Ekeler also very impressive.
Dewayne Locks
So this is called football......?
Ertz and Mccafrey really showed up for this win! Great team effort😊
They got good weapons too
Nice win for the Commanders.
53 players on each team and not a single defender in either squad... Amazing
Doug williams would be proud of jayden daniels .💯👍
Daniels can run like lamar but might be a better passer?? 🤔.  Its not like washington has a great receivers except scary terry but daniels passes are great and he can run.  Even that spin-move run to get a first down is like lamar
WHAT A GAME
Look at all that LSU out there
I miss the Redskins
F'n Bengals "CHOCKED" to the Redskins! 🤬
Bengals being 0-3 and Washington being 2-1 is not what I expected.
Cowboys could have gotten him or anyone else but no we spent 300 mill on Prescott
“Stay healthy brudda” yea … that Louisiana rubbed off on him
Represent Cajon high school let's goooo
Martinez Charles Thompson Shirley Clark Carol
but did u see that block by Jeremy Mcnichols on that T Mclaurin catch??!! 11:26
Bengals going on a down hill
Watching the tape and analyzing The Bangles offense is pretty good they don't keep Joe in bad situations he gets the ball out quick and they catch everything underneath and become an athlete and move up the field their defense on the other hand give up too much plays the Bengals just have to figure out a way to finish they can't the commanders did great Daniels protected the ball receivers called passes that he threw to him they ran the ball well and their defense prevented the Bengals from finishing off in the red zone
They had eleven not ten guys on the field Troy.
Jayden Daniels playing like an Upgraded Lamar jackson. Has a beautiful arm
Human growth hormones supplements testosterone for Men estrogen for women get them at GNC pharmacy phone computer it's what sports players use get your son a foot Ball it will be the teach him to fight lesson in life
As I look back Austin was the unsung hero of the game. His kick return, his TD run and his consistent play making kept us going
Jayden Daniels > Lamar Jackson
Lee Amy Clark Matthew Thomas Mark
Bengals back in their usual form
Chills.
Daniels should have had five TDs too , he had three completions that were inches short of goal line lol
Finally my team something to believe in, born in 88’ and we won two bowls by the time I was 3 and since then it’s been hell. Still redskins always though
No touchdown animation for Trent Scott? 😔 what A shame
Martinez Dorothy Gonzalez Jason Thomas Donald
Commanders O line was eating 🔥🔥🔥
The announcers could’ve done a lot better especially for the exciting moments
Best game Ive seen the "skins" play in years!
대니얼스 거르고 윌리엄스 풉ㅋ
❤
You can do everything with a good line offence or defence
I got lots of respect for Jayden Daniels. 🫡
Typical Bengals script🤣 They lose the first few weeks then lock in the rest of the season... No need to panick
Theyre gonna be good this yr, but next yr, look out! Sure up that defense and get JD another weapon to throw to and they'll be ridiculous!
I like watching highlights of every game. I wish I could understand the game but I love the intensity of the game
Raider Nation rn 😢
Crazy stat 😂
mans was literally TACKLING TERRY on that last touchdown throw lmfaooo. man Amazing by Terry and Jaylen and the whole offense.
Worst defensive called game I've ever seen ...zero deception..you could tell when they were blitzing and same when playing coverage ...Daniels is decent but cmon dude had enough time to eat a hot pocket back there .. bengals litterally have the worst defense in the league ..Daniels won't have another game like this all year..
20507 Schaefer Square
Taylor Matthew Thomas Christopher Lopez Anna
the team looking great they need keep the same performance as long they keep doing it gonna have good season. I’m Viking fan just showing love
I live in Philly im a Eagles fan and because im also a  76ers fan i New when the owners bought the Washington Commanders i new they were going to trun things around and already you can see this team is better Washington is now the second best team in the division so congratulations LoL just beat Dallas  All jokes aside there coming thr future of are division just got interesting and that much stronger this team is going to be contender again its not just my Eagles 🦅 and the Cowboys 🗑️ the Commanders are coming faster than I thought no Diddy LOL I'm happy for yall tho finally going to be legit contenders for second place in the Division Fly 🦅 Eagles Fly 🤏
I hate YouTube. 8 adds for a 14 min video. Gfys
Ello
Great to see Jayden looking down the field at all options. Could be a very special player. I press my thumbs !
Absolute 🔥 game, and easily game of the year as of now at least.. good job Washington, looks like you guys will have to be watched the next years to come.. also one of the 5 youngest teams as well I’ve heard !?
6:14 whT the hell was the kicker doing?? Number 2??? Like cmon man
That last TD thrown by that young man was filthy 🤢 Blitz unblocked took a shot dot 🎯
Yo everybody this truly was a team effort of pure execution. Lead by our Franchise quarterback 👏. Coaching and all 3 phases performed better than our fans even expected, but was hoping 4. 🙏 Amen?
Stop showing who won in the thumbnail
Redskins forever
That #AMP Dance was 🔥.. Tylil
The Dead skins are hungry.
Don't forget McCaffery was couple inches from his first NFL TD.
I am here not to view this for the first time but for the 3rd time.
Daniela Common
I'm grateful for these highlights, but please don't encourage the touchdown celebrations by including them.
5 had all kinda pressure in his face and dropped Dat pass on the dime!
Commander fans we got us one Jayden Daniels was a beast out there
special game...Jayden Daniels legendary performance
Joe wit da block tho
As a skins fan I like this but let me not get to happy
What a night, Jayden Daniels had, he went, 21/23Comp/Att, Plus Washington was perfect in the red-zone, not to mention Jayden didn't make any mistakes in this game that's what you need to win as a young Quarterback in the NFL night in and night out.🏈
No one has cared about Jayden Daniels til this game, Caleb Williams has been all the talk, It’s dumb how much the media changes bc someone gets noticed once after they’ve been doing good every game
Loser Bengals always find a way to lose to the Washington Losers, Jayden Daniels outplayed Loser QB Joe Burrow.
Jayden Daniels is better than advertised. That juke he put on Ossai was nasty, sheeesh!
13:00 well that looks familiar?
Feels good to be a commanders fan 🙌
This just pissed me off patriots where is Drake May..?!?!? 🤬🤬
Lets be honest the refs gave the game to the commanders!
He'll of a game!!!
Rooting for Washington to win the division!!
The LSU Heisman game did not disappoint my god. shoutout to Jamar Chase, Terry Mclaurin and the OC’s for both teams great game
Happy for Commander fans. Terrible ownership, name change, obscurity in their division, it's awesome to watch this team/franchise finally find a generational talent. Have they ever had a big name talent at QB? I guess RG3 and Kirk briefly but those guys never panned out they way they'd hoped.
I love jayden daniels game bro was amazing
11-6 Redskins   This team is LEGIT  Ekeler???  Bobby Wagner   When did they get these guys  This is a solid team
Derrick Pines
Rg3 vibes without the injury he Daniels is doing a great job running and protecting him self good job squad HTTR/ HTTC 💯🤛🏾
No one knows how to tackle anymore.
Washington redskins.
This defense was showing issues in 23 seems to be a much bigger problem now in 24
What a game!!!
💯
Daniels has superstar written all over him
nobody talking about how terry cooked
It’s always the Second Qb drafted that always goes crazy 🥶🥶🔥
Those blaming Joe Burrow for the woes of the Bengals don't know football. He's doing his job leading the team. I mean the stats don't lie. Minus the Patriots game. But this game and the Chiefs should of been victories for them but the defense failed him. Joe played great both games but the defense surrendering all them points is what hurt them.  I mean how you let the Commanders drop 38 points on you? Teams could have better defenses and offenses if they could spread the money out more. Instead, you have to pay 2 or 3 guys a quadrillion dollars to play for you and get average people to fill out the rest of your team. Money is ruining sports.
As an LSU fan, I was rooting for a tie game. LOL. Both of LSU's heismen winners and Jamar Chase played great.
Why does the commanders center always look seconds becore a snap that to me seems like a easy way to let defense know
TRENT SCOTT LEGEND
The missed field goal is technically a turnover on downs.... no?
아쉽다. 벵갈스..  개인적으로 마이애미에서 이적해온 geseki.. 어감이.. ㅋㅋㅋ. 응원합니다!!!
We are still gonna win the super bowl we are the best team in the sport #BENGALSFAN4LIFE
Cowboys all y’all had to do was move Dan Quinn to head coach
W Edit I watched the highlights to this game it was crazy
I've come back to watch this four times now. 😂
Most emotion I've heard from Buck ever
Heisman
The new quarterback is amazing!  I am very impressed with his performance!
JD GOT CRAZY AURA
Wow, the QBs weren’t messing about in this. Congratulations Commanders, that’s one decent QB you got.
Why does the graphic of first cut says "Commanders Commanders vs Cincinnati Bengals"?
People didn't want this kid because he had weird elbows.
Didn’t burrow and Daniel’s play Together at lsu?
I said he's the next Lamar
This game was played in arcade mode
Tyreek Hill has one TD reception this season which is as many as a Commanders offensive lineman and a Chiefs offensive lineman!!! I guess he's been "handcuffed" this season!!! 😂
This game it looks like a Super bowl game, it was amazing especially on a Monday Night and none of the teams having no turnovers or punts awesome👍
They should have payed Joe and it sgows
GOD I LOVE MI REDSKINS / COMMANDERS
jayden daniels is him…
Like pat McAfee show says who are we the commanders! Lmao still mskes ne laugh
I didn't know bobby Wagner was still in NFL he's a OG
Jayden Daniels Pops is PROUD 5:08 " That's my kid ! "
Cincinnati’s gonna make a run don’t count them out in the AFC! The Commanders beat a-good team tonight Cincinnati’s gonna beat the bills in the AFC championship!
Bengals couldn't score a touchdown in the first part of the g as me. That's why they lost. Way to go Bungles.
I’m a Dallas Cowboys fan but I think the Washington Redskins/commanders are the best team in our division! They are the most complete team and only will get better starting next week! look how their defense is flying around the ball! And they got some hitters! And we’re not even talking about their offense yet and their A1 quarterback! Their offense is just waiting to happen and boy when it does happen they’re gonna be bad as hell and hard to stop!
47 year old Redskins fan, that's what we do, HTTR!!!!!
THAT KID 🐐 GEAUX TIGERS 🐅
Lamar gives the bengals fits Jayden comes to the nfl looking like baby Lamar gives bengals fits 🤣😂😂 bengals so poverty 😂😂
Love the no passing interference call on Tee Higgins
Washington thank the Eagles for y'all getting Brian Johnson who has y'all offense looking unstoppable
As a Cowboys fan all I can say is great lol
11:30 That blitz pick up from that RB 💪🏽
Good thing you put up the Jacksonville Buffalo score too. Now I don't have to watch that game 💩
11:26.... WHAT A THROW
Two LSU Goats
Jayden Daniels is winning the OROTY! Blessings to his football career 🔥
Uh oh. 2nd year in a row the 2nd up is gonna be that guy huh.
Jayden Daniels is what Caleb was supposed to be.
https://youtu.be/Y_Mnkirx7Gg?si=35q8edm8oIbCd5WF
Jayden just reminds me of rookie rg3
Bengals should trade Higgins for a Rb
NFL please stop spoiling these videos by showing the winners in the thumbnails!!!
Bears fan here…Jayden Daniels will be one of the greats!
Lol that last dpi same as the non call on chiefs
Nah the QBs are showing out this year, that throw was sum else 😭🔥🔥
From the College level I just knew Jayden is gonna be something special, there is more to come
Is Washington going to be that team nobody saw coming? That QB they got is pretty good.
Commanders have proven skill position players on offense and the young qb is looking good too. Sneaky good team to make playoffs
daniels reminds me of mariota with his build snd release, but is alot more aggressive with his throws
Bro, what HAPPENED?! I thought the Bengals were supposed to be good 😅
Crazy how fast the nfl changes.
both defenses were so bad tonight
I'm Cautiously optimistic. We simply out scored a winless team. Yes he had 3 4th down conversions with 2 incompletions. But not everyteam is builtike the former shell of the Bengals
Two broken plays and a missed fg end of story
The command is not going anywhere
The bengals defense didn't step up.
He look like 2019 MVP Lamar. It’s scary
GO REDSKINS
no turnovers and no punts...amazing.
The TD pass to the Big Lineman was a Heck of a Play!
Drafting Terry and Daniels on Fantasy starting to pay off
DC got a great team again
Chicago Bears wondering if they got Bryced not picking the second guy, oh no!
Speechless
2:28 what did I miss? Or is this just the camera messing with my eye?
Trent Scott set it out didnt he? Lol (I cant use the w but shoutout to the bruhz!)
Same thing happened to Pitts Sunday night and the chiefs didn't get that call smh
The bengals defense is ROUGH man. They’re not winning many games with that defense
Redskins won.
That bengals defense is not good man. Idk what they’re doing but I feel like their coaches forgot they went to the Super Bowl like 3 years ago and are still living off that
Juice Washington commandos ❤️
That's how I dance angle 🧡🧡💯
The Return of the Bungles
Commanders are going to be good af
Joey Bayou, JD5 & JC1! 🐅⚜
I liked that "stay healthy brother" there at the end!
The redskins looked good
The Bengals are 0-3 lol
I been a Bungals fan since a kid they office been stale since I can have memories 😔
The way Buck screamed TD reminds me of T.H on the TD pass against the Giants on MNF 11:24 to 11:33
Burrow with the block is CRAZY
Huge win for the Redskins
I think the bengals found their legs, I bet they don’t lose another game here on out. My opinion
Imagine Washington's defense if they had cornerbacks that would.... TURN TF AROUND!!!!!!
Impressive!!!! Mr jayden
Hey Commanders fans..are yall getting that RG3 vibe from 2012 again? yall should be.
Pass interference with the back of the helmet ?
I'm a fan of Daniels now
We had 2 plays with 10 players on the field on that drive..
I would have challenged that against crossing the plane 8:48.
Only true fans call the team Redskins regardless
Daniels QBR had to be perfect...wasn't it?
Checked out on dc after many years of heartache. Not jumping in after 3 games but Daniels may restore the faith of the fan base
U commander fans have a bright future up ahead with Jayden Daniels. A fantastic QB. I’m a Seahawks fan but can easily agree that the commanders are gonna do great, and even make the playoffs
Bengals: Back to Back AFC Championship Games to Unless a Miracle Happens, Back to Back No Playoffs.
Daniels was awesome except he better start sliding
Quinn said f-it on 4th all game 😂
Are Washington play off bound?
I respect Dan Quinn’s playcalling here. He had faith in his rookie QB and it paid off. Thank you for providing one of the greatest games I’ve seen in a while. I’m also glad the refs didn’t get in the way of this game like they usually do in prime time games.
JAYDEN WILL HAVE A BETTER CAREER THAN CALEB!! Mark my words with a permanent marker
This my redskins?
As a fan of the commanders I think we got away with this game that pass interference should have been called so I am not happy until our defense gets better commanders defense was getting dogged all night so it's a L for me .
Those guys did LSU proud....
I'm so proud of Jayden he didn't allow bright lights or playing on the road shake him up. This kid is something special and we're seeing it each game. 0 punts again, Jayden's first touchdown, he finally connects with Terry and he looked like he couldn't get enough oh this team is on it's way up.
I HOPE my Eagles are watching this. We've got a REAL Threat!
Caleb Williams wishes he could make those plays at the NFL level. Williams isnt even a good person either. Daniels is
Daniels & the Redskins Looked GREAT tonight !!!!
This is going to go down as THE BEST QUARTERBACK DRAFT CLASS EVER!!!!!!
This was so impressive As a lifelong Washington fan I am so freaking excited FINALLY
Daniels is a baller  STAMPED. Also Cincy is buns in September
Money Mac aka "Pretty Boy" running away instead of trying to tackle that returner was hilarious!
Ever since the recent NFL Draft, I had a feeling Jayden Daniel's was gonna top Caleb Williams. Something about him just screams out greatness to me.
Washington's QB might be the best they've had in years. And the Bengals might have the worst corners in the league?
Salute the COMMANDERS !!!!!!!  (shout out James in Virginia)  Everyone saying McLaurin was washed LOOKING SILLY TODAY!          HTTR BABYYYYYYY - we got us a QB! And this team is playing HARD for Quinn - LFG!!!
What a game from Jayden Daniels! He'll have a nice career if he continues to play like this. Nice work Commanders!
Looks like a fun season this year!
All I gotta say is HTTR!
As good as the Commanders played the Bengals, missed a field goal, and missed a 2-point conversion, end up losing by five, #SMH 😅
5:08 proud pops🤘🏽
Two champion LSU quarterbacks showing the rest of the league how it's done.
No one to blame but Joes hair
Cinci is awful 😂 they are just awful
2:38 Teach Tape   Forced incompletion & softened them ribs up.   That TE will think twice next time he tries to high point a ball.
We now know why the NFL riggs these games for offenses. After every score here comes commercial$.
The Bengals 🗑 🚮 🗑 🚮 😂😂😂😂
Man if they change the name back and he gets to wear a Redskins helmet I would be stoked!!!!
CALEB WILLIAMS WHO?
Nice 2 see Washington doing good but wtf is happening to Cincinnati looks like the super bowl loss hurt more than any one though
something that concerns me is the washing defence. Besides that this was a awesome game by them and people can call this "the breakthrough game" of jayden daniels, jumpstarting his career
I hate that Burrow is getting blamed for the loss when he gets the bengals points literally every single drive besides when Evan missed the FG.
Why isn't Ben Sinnott getting much playing time.  He can sub in for Ertz. But they just put in Bates.
This game had no turnovers or punts for all 4 quarters!! First time since the 1940s. Extremely impressive!!
Washington's 1st win in Cincy since 1991
THEY'RE EATING THE DAWGS, THEYRE EATING THE CATS OF OHIO
🔥 jd5
Im a Bengels fan but they get to to over confident. And that's why the lead Bengels lead but you have to keep leading.  They need more focus  and celebrate after the game if they win but hey didn't.
good game
Monday Night Football 2:42
We haven’t punted since week 1….I know it’s early but I think I speak for all washington fans when I say we haven’t felt this kind of magic in our football team in a LONG time. HAIL TO THE COMMANDERS
could JD the second coming of RGIII for the Commandoes!?
Hopefully the commanders keep this up and bring some actual competition for the eagles this year..  Joey B is a fugging BEAST!  THAT 40+ YARD DIME AT 11:37 IN THE 1ST quarter was BEAUTIFUL.   Love to see the boy play. He definitely brought CINCI Back from Purgatory since his first season.   I Hope he gets a few Rings! he is one of the hardest working, natryally talented QB's, with a wicked arm of this young QB ERA. Top 5 QB for sho!
Commentators hating on Commanders!
Daniel's is the man!
@6:25 The fact that he did NOT run makes me think he could be really good
Watch us raiders lose to bengals 🤦🏽‍♂
Future looks bright still lots of work to build this team into a contender but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I think JD #5 is our guy HTTRS!!!
It's so much talk about burrow, they played great, it was honestly a good game!
Both LSU Heisman winning quarterbacks playing great tonight jayden Daniels looks really good 👍
Some great throws from both QBs 💪
Terry is such a beast. That last catch the CB got there early and was draped all over him. Should've been an interference call.
Jamarr Chase would be a great fit for the seahawks. Geno Smith has an arm. Chase has the hands. And Metcalf is there. Let the Bengals fumble him.
JB elite QB, huh?! LOL
Washington were far better when they were called the Washing Redskins. Such a shame what's happened to that team.
Bro im finna cry we finally look good 😭
Ads on YouTube are crazy. 2 ads every 10 seconds. Can’t even watch the highlights
Football is better
Bengals defense is awful, even Brissett went 12/12 to start a game against them.
Joe the Bum Burrows
I'm gobsmacked that Cincy is 0-3
Won't Daniels' performance turn out to be just a disgusting Bengals defensive play? We'll find out in the next match.
Gunna raise a JD to JD....cheers!
That Bengals defense is going to make the Red rocket this Sunday look like an MVP candidate 🤣🤣🤣
Imagine the dudes at Arizona st rn…. Punching the air
Commanders d has backslide
Imagine being a Bengals fan 😂
Daniels was throwing bombs last night, none more impressive than his second TD pass. He’s impressed me a lot. Didn’t think much of him as a passer coming out—thought he was slow with his reads and was bailed out by two elite receivers a lot in college, although I did rate him as a deep ball thrower (I thought Daniels and Penix were the best in class at throwing deep). Anyway, he’s doing very well through three games. Happy for him and Dan Quinn.
what the sigma is going on in our division
Please don't put the picture of the winning team in the thumbnail. It's a spoiler for those who haven't watched the game. Thank you.
Daniel’s arm is so accurate and the ball looks so pretty no diddy lol
what happened to the bengals defence ...
$275 Million for 5 years????
A new NFL ⭐️ was born last night. Maybe not this season, but the Commanders will definitely be Superbowl contenders in the near future. Daniels is impressive.
JD on point...
If I'm another NFC East team I'm putting a bounty on Daniels.
The Washing Commanders have been dominating. Hope it lasts.
So happy for the Commanders! Just like the Jets, they needed a little break on the QB situation and it looks like they got what they needed. #kudos
Thanks for restoring hope for the Washington Faithful! Let's go team‼️‼️‼️💪🏾🙌🏾
Jaden McDaniels will be a RG111 that never got hurt God forbid 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Throwing more touchdowns than incompletions is insane 😂 🔥
What a game
As a chiefs can I can confirm that’s the refs were the only thing that made the commanders win
Washington redskins 🧑🏻‍🎤👩🏾‍🦰
Losing to the Redskins is crazy work!
10:05 pause
Commanders have better coaches than the Bengals
Brilliant throws by both QBs.  This was fun to watch.
We may be looking at the ROY and one of the worst tackling defenses ever. Glad we got to see another Thick Six tho 😂
whats wrong with bengals defense.....
The Bengals have a great offense and QB but the defense is on vacation so they can't win.
Jayden Daniels...LSU by way of ASU...
Hail the redskins.good win We need to beat those  cowboys in both games🎉
as a Bengals fan we're cooked we ain't ever winning a super bowl
Burrow needs to concentrate on playing football, and stop trying to look and acting cool, end being the fool.
Gotta love a big guy TD
As a Falcon fan first I want to say good game Washington.. y'all look good.. second that pass interference in the end zone looks like the same exact one that happened to Kyle Pitts.. is there any difference? Thanks curious fan
The Commanders O-line balled out this game
Game of the year candidate
That pass at 11:33 from Daniels is something to teach to the young QBs out there
If i am being honest, the Bengals are still the Super Bowl contenders they were in previous years, and while they didn't win, i could still see the skill and finesse. I believe that with some different approaches, they would be back to winning. I think it is a coaching issue.
Nothing to really do with the game specifically but has anyone noticed how much more enthusiastic joe buck has been these last 2 years? He used to have the excitement of a tomato.  Somehow becoming one of my favorites now.
the NFC East just got really interesting
So thats a pass interference (which it was) but the KC one against Pitts was not ... gotcha NFL. At least try to make it look less obvious.
No way to cut it. Cincy's D lost them the game. Joe B looking like his old self. 0-3 is not ideal, but I'm still not sleeping on the Bengals. They seem to like back themselves into a corner.
I’m just glad to see the Bengals at 0-3😂
Gino Haven
Commanders have some nice offense
Bryce Young should learn from Daniels on how to throw the ball with accuracy
I refuse to watch the commanders our who ever they are now change name back to red skins and I'll be number one fan
'This one is launched for McClauren.....He's got it'.....long pregnant pause..'touch-down'(fantastic commentary)
Is Ekeler ok>?
Washington did a great job managing the clock in the 4th
Wtflip are the commanders? Phuking cave ins.
Finally a real franchise qb commanders/redskins fan till death💪🏾💀
Man we better not lose to the Bengals this Sunday after that humiliating performance they had against a mediocre Washington team. Even though we just came off of an unexpected win against Vegas, I still don’t want to get my hopes up because it’s the Panthers and obviously the Bengals are way more talented despite being 0-3.
The offense and JD won this game, the defense was terrible. Their defense is really starting to scare me.
This was the best I've seen the Commanders look in a long time, let alone...I think this was the highest scoring game for them in a long time as well
WTF Jayden Daniel’s is the truth!!!
HTTR !!!!!!!!!!!
So glad to see this. After all the years of #$?#🤬 owner and management, the fans and the team deserve some hope.
Great to see Washington coming back, I remember the team of the 80s, Joe thiesmann,, Wilbur Jackson Art monk etc……
Jayden Daniels for OROY!!!
Jayden daniels steals the show
jayden daniels is the real deal
pain. pure searing pain. burrow back but still not on top and moss isnt even close to mixon. also i think the chem burrow boyd was better. the only really impressive play my team showed was the block from burrow ^^
Dont forget, it was white people that hated the Redskins name
0 picks through 4 weeks btw
"Everybody knows the Bengals are the team to beat in the AFC"...yep...everyone beats them...
Panic in time in Cincy, 😢
1:32 🚬😮‍💨🥷😷 blackball? 1.5 mil views good game lads.
That loss has to be on the coaching. Why are you settling for FGs when it’s clear your defense can’t stop them?
people don’t have their own brains the algorithm proves that I noticed since I started watching football and nirvana the shits exploded nfl went from 7 mil subs to 19 mil in a matter of a year similar case with nirvana so I guess they just take what free thinkers are watching and be like here guys someone has their own brain so follow what they are watching 😂😂
this was a terrible defensive game....but good on daniels for taking advantage. he looks like a stud
bro jamaar why did u have a good game i would of won my fantasty but he had to drop 2 tds and 130 yards receiving
REDSKINS
Daniels isn't just gifted with all of the physical necessary tangibles but he also plays very very smart football! They're tough to beat when he's on his game!!!!
In a redraft, at this point who goes number 1?
Any highlight reel of a bengals game that they lose in isn’t complete without a shot of the fans going down the esca-loser at the end of the game.
Bengals looking washed. They did this last year early on so we will see
The NFC is often times more dominant and Washington Represented very nicely!!! Daniels QB is a Super Stud!!!
WAS has not PUNTED since week 1. Let that sink in
Based on the high level from which Daniels plays at I think it's obvious that he views himself as good as any young QB in the NFL
All commanders need is to improve their defense.
just realized theyre both heisman winners from LSU. what a matchup!! Also Burrow with a block!!
We all got to be honest to ourselves: we thought this game would be boring. Turns out to be possibly the best mnf game of the year.
Skins defense needs to get it together! The front line should definitely should be playing better than this aa they are experienced! The secondary needs some serious help! Good DB's still out there needing a team!
Dancing in end zone like girls! They need to go to side lines and be cheerleaders
Bengals getting clapped at home by a rookie on primetime in a historic game against a team named the Commanders is the best thing I couldve seen thus far
As a 49ers fan who was born and raised in the DMV, it's a breath of fresh air when Washington is good.
Daniel can play!
CHICAGO FRONT OFFICE AND BEARS NATION PUNCHING AIR RN 😂😂😂 LMFAAAOOO HAHAHA
Bengals defense making opossite qb`s look like MVP`s...
Joe Burrow got turned away from Nebraska and McCaffrey couldn't get the ball at Nebraska
Cincy is the best 0-3 team in NFL history... :_
what a game, excited for Burrow and daniels for what they gonna this season!
Luke McCaffery active tonight, and I’m here for it.
are they booing tee higgin?
It's jus like last year the number 2 pick at Qb looks alot better than the number 1 pick😂 jayden daniels looks like the number 1 pick over that nail polishing dress wearing freak in chicago
Daniel’s it’s actually him 😮
Dallas should have fired Mike McCarthy and made Dan Quinn the head coach.
Chase said they are the team to beat in the AFC. It’s not too late to change your mind lol 😂🎉
Scary Terry def top 5 WR imo
Bring back the Redskins!
Old Redskins fan here, I haven't been this excited for football in DC since the early 1990s or when little dan snyder sold the team. Ovevhkins held the torch for DC for 2 decades, I hope and pray J a yden Daniel's can pick up where Ovie leaves off. Go Caps GO! GO Redskin/Commandos GO!  GO! GO!
washington qb is good. nice pick by washington
QBU is in Baton Rouge
The "team to beat im the afc" goes 0-3. What a poverty franchise 😂
As a bengals fan, and a diehard lsu fan this game was literally everything, seeing joe burrow and Jayden Daniels face for the first time was amazing, even tho the bengals lost I still loved this game after all it is just a game!
4:42 and the last TD throw were unbelievable throws by Jayden. He's gonna be great.
Most excited I’ve heard Joe buck on the last TD pass from Daniels
Finally....a REAL running game for Washington.  I'm here for Ekler.
Bengals defend the pass like a high school team.
we in fact did not have 10 people on the field on the scary td
Cowboys lose they blame Prescott or Jerry Jones. When Lamar lose they always blame Lamar.🤷🏿‍♂️
Longtime Washington fan I gotta say, last night felt fantastic. Daniels was on fire and you can tell the coaching is much better than in recent years! Keep it going!
11:25 Certified Dawg!!
Don’t look now but here come the Commanders
This another quarterback that will spank my Giants.. Washington’s offense looked like a smooth running Honda civic engine
All glory to God ‘ - Jayden Daniel’s . Great young man. Prayers to this brother.
KEEP IT GOING WASHINGTON!!!!
Daniels picked apart those bengals CB’s
Jayden Daniels has an arm, holy heck. I think this makes the Commanders the favorites to win the NFC East.
Dances are stupid.
Who was tha QB between Burrow & JD at LSU?😂feel like I forgot all about bro or was he just playin when JD got hurt
The Bengals looked pretty good until Washington got the ball.
If you told me the Bengals scored 33 I would have said "easy Win"
11:27 That that McLaurin Td was clearly pass interference but yall know the refs do for the home team 12:50 gone call it on Washington tho
What a fun game!  It's been a long time since I've felt real hope as a Washington fan; it's been building and we still have a long way to go, but I'm beyond excited!  #RaiseHail
7:08 that's for all the dawgs troy😂
Daniels might be him
"4th and 4, and you're winning? What, are they insane?"  *gets the first down* "They are geniuses!"
Exciting game. Daniels looks amazing! Great QB!!
Congrats commanders you finally have  team
Daniels gonna be the CJ of this draft
i think the real winner of this game was LSU
That's how you do it, Caleb
No turnovers or punts the entire game. That's crazy.
“ he’s only good for short passes , good college offense for him  “ daniels showed him otherwise 😂😂😂😂😂
TIGER UPPERCUT!
Seriously Urlacher?!  WTF is wrong with you?
“That’s my kid “ is a flex form Jayden’s dad!!!! ❤❤
Vernon davis ,pierre garcon times are gone but this jd qb bringing good times
Never once did I see Brady or Manning do a little girl dance in the end zone. The NFL is ghetto and feminine. Pink accessories are coming up in October! Wait for it!
Bengals defense needs to get better. Also, they need to score in the red zone.
Congratulations Washington you got yourself a franchise QB.
I went to this game and i loved how everyone whould yell teeeeee when tee higgens caught a ball and the refs sucked the commanders are not the chiefs
This means its curtains for the Cowgirls
Surprised Bengals fans aint on here crying about refs
What seems to work is when the OC simplifies the playbook.
The best we looked in a while. About time.
jayden daniels is gonna be star
how many punts or turnovers have the Commanders had this season? I don't know how much the Commanders could improve over the season. How much better could you be than tonight? Just keep playing like they did tonight.
them boys was balling out last night, what a game
Jayden Daniels is better than Burrow and he’s a Rookie I don’t want nobody to say that Joe Burrow is better than Mahomes stop it!!
"We're the team to beat in the AFC" Goes 0-3 🤣🤣🤣
The Bengals are the best 0-3 team of all time
What a big guy...
Great Monday Night game
I'm a Cowboy fan but Jayden Daniels is on 🔥
My boys won dat game fym 💪🏽👹 W FOR THE W’s
JD is unbelievable. ROTY by farrrrr
Washington can do some damage this year. Thay got a young Doug Williams .What a throw.
51 got single legged at 11:28 hahahahaha
Best game of the season thus far
Just watching they have to fix their defense  asp
Glad to see the mandies revelanty and winnin
Whole game without Turnover…Witnessed pure American Fotball, plus JD5 played like Prime Tom Brady for some reason 😅😅
Daniels will lead them into the future. Commanders' front office just has to work on that defense
Loved seeing my LSU dawgs ball out
The best either team's defense did in this game was to limit the other team to a field goal attempt. That has never happened since 1940, according to what I read. No punts, no TOs, no turnover on downs. One missed FG, but that's it.
Who Dey indeed 😂
Daniels reminds me of Lamar last year ! Sheesh
STOP POSTING WHO WINS IN THE THUMBNAIL
0-4 every year  Why we do this
The only thing Bills Mafia is bummed about is not being able to watch JD drop bombs all over the Bungles.
if commanders can just tweak their defense a little they can be an actual threat the way daniels has been playing.
This Daniels is what Commanders needed.
Great game!  Congrats to the Commanders.  Keep this up and take your division!
Somebody please explain why the Bengals boo’ing Higgins?
Looks like some teams fumbled on the draft board. Bet a couple months ago nobody would of said Daniel’s is better than Caleb
Is he better than Caleb??? He might be
Humiliation😢
2:59 look how slow Hubbard is off the ball 😢
Redskins!
We need Bill Belichick to be made an offer to be Washingtons defensive coordinator. This Coordinator aint doin it
11:27 is one of the best throws I’ve ever seen
Hail to the commanders for playing a fabulous game😊😊😊
Omg Washington has a real football team 😮 My giants will be at the bottom for years to come
JD IS A BEAST. GOOD FOR WASHINGTON.
Bengals must feel snake bit …..
IF THE SKINS KEEP PLAYING LIKE THAT THEY MIGHT WIN THE NFC EAST!!!
Does bengals have the best o line 😮😮😮
Red skins o line is very good
Bring back the Redskins
Commanders have many lions players and coaches . It’s paying off for them .
Man I don't care who you are that was a game. you wouldn't ask more from either team real talk that was exciting asf💙💙💙
I ain't seen a seen a Washington quarterback look this good since Doug Williams in 88' against John Elway. Jayden Daniels is our GUY!
How about that pass interference Atl, the NFL is getting on my nerve. They choose who wins and lose.
Our defense was not in that game🤷🏾‍♂️😟but it’s still time to win more games
My favorite thing other than the WIN IS JD5 SLIDING
GOOD GAME
11:28 ladies and gents your kyrie of the nfl, Jayden Daniel’s😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
he played the PERFECT game in his 3rd career game... that was wild..
As a Chicago Bears fan I find this deeply disturbing.
My commanders are actually gong to the playoffs Jayden Daniel is going to be this face of our franchise.
What an awesome game by Daniels. He's clearly so far better than Caleb Williams. It's not even close. Bears will regret not picking this dude!
Washington looks on point this year.  Best team ive seen in 2 decades.....If they play like this all season they will be more then enough for any team in the NFC East.
Young blood looks like Lamar Jackson....
Look at those Commies getting Ws
Now this is a football game! Jealous of those attending, wish I was there.
First td pass was to a lineman. As if you couldn't get any sweeter. Wow.
I wanted to see the advanced stats, Jayden Daniel’s completed 21 of 23 pass attempts with 254 total and 2 Td’s while averaging 11 yards per completion!!!!
This might be the start of making people in the Washington DC area more happy, one thing this city did love is the Redskins ! Been a lot of pain and suffering here, some just think it was a myth that people in this city were happy once.
Bucs fan, knew from the game in week 1 there was something special with JD. Hope he can keep it up.
Jd was great tonight ,Joe burrow is surgical, if you don't double chase he'll go for 300
Big man TDs are the best! 🤣🤣🤣 6:37
LFG 🥂 finally running stunts on the online and getting terry involved. We need more pressure from the dline to ease the pressure on our vet LBs and young DBs. Future is bright. 🔥🔥
Love the confidence of the QB.
🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Go Redskins!
Hail to the REDSKINS
Go SKINS ! Lol
Are they going back to The Redskins? Do anyone know
as a long time washington fan this brought so much joy seeing my team play like this. HTTR
Jayden Daniel’s showed that he can go in the big leagues🐐
JD5
i started cj stroud instead of daniel’s this week and i feel like a fool
Giants paid the wrong Daniel
Redskins
What we learned from week 3 is the Commanders are a thing with jayden
I’m glad Washington doing good I would say the only thing they need to work on is tackling and maybe a few plays on defense
Are you not entertained
7:33 Jamarr needs to be benched with that little effort of blocking..
Bengals only had one team on the field
Can't hide the fact that the game was on hype all 4 qtrs.  Def wasn't quiet like the Denver game.
11:26 That was a hell of a throw!
Sideyes Caleb Williams
LSU QB shootout!  Now that was entertaining!  Best QB duel I’ve seen since Brady and Mahommes about 5 years back.
Always happy for my black QBs esp handing America’s sweetheart this L .
Everyone laughed at Dan Orlovsky when he said he would draft Daniels first overall instead of Williams. Look who's laughing now.
The Snyder Curse has been lifted!
Bengals no! Obviusly the fault is the kansas 😂
That TD by moss won me my fantasy game by 1pt…I was down 5 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
As a lifelong Washington fan, that was a beautiful game. Jayden and the Commanders are a real threat in both conferences.
I Guess the Bungles are back ???
Everyone in the comments talking about the TD but Jayden's 56 yarder to TM was unsurpassed 04:40. It looked like something out of the movies! The height,  speed / spin and descent of the ball was phenomenal, in terms of being visually pleasing it might be the play of the game. Great route and catch by the receiver also !
the NFL
Eagles and cowboys are on alert now in the nfc east
Wow. Looks like Washington finally has their franchise QB.
I remember when everyone was saying LSU was stupid for getting jayden Daniels, eat those words and be wrong.
Please stop the fake crowd noise
Trent Scott MVP
Oh ya Daniel's gonna be a problem
who dey ?? 0 and 3  the bungles are back baby  !
Daniels had all day back there could have pulled a chair out
Daniels cold as hell yo 😎🥶
Gooo Jayden!!!
Did Jayden Daniels make even a single mistake the whole night??
Ik the Bears sick
Happy for Wildflower!
Change the name back to Washington Redskins!!
Eckert was always great, bad for chargers to give him up, great for Wa.
As a Chiefs fan, way to go Commanders. JD is a beast, I hope he does well for himself.....except against my Chiefs of course.
No turnovers or punts since 1940, pretty impressive
Should've paid bates
I just needed Burrow to throw it to Higgins one more time, and 3 of my parlays would have hit😂 nothing but pain last night.
Dallas should be worried .
Feel bad for Burrow. He’s on a team with the worst defense ever. Gonna be a long year for him.
How many Bengal fans are going to say that this game was rigged??!!  ALL refereeing crews are against the Bengals!!!
Hey Ques!
Why are so many helmets flying off this year? Is anyone else noticing this?
commanders are fun to watch now after all these years ! Lets go east coast
Just here to rewatch my glorious king JD5🎉🎉🎉
way to go bears pick the wrong guy again
Great game. Commanders look like they have themselves a quarterback.
No punts and No turnovers. 1st time since the 40's...Just wow. All offense.
Amazing team performance 👏
Big Man TD
Meanwhile In Chicago…..
CJ Stroud: *Has single greatest rookie season of all time!*  Jayden Daniels: Hold my jock straps.
Everyone should be calming down. It’s 1 game. And patriots beat bengals too. Burrow is likely overhyped like Herbert. While he made the SB let’s see if he can get close anytime soon.  Commanders need to evaluate after game 12
EX-LSU university QB Derby!!!
It's always good seeing the more turbulent franchises in the NFL start to figure it out and see some success. The Lions, the Texans, and now it's Washington's turn.
Big Bruhs Catching TD Passes
WE HAVE A QB 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bengals are cooked
And this the guy you'lls people think is going to take down Patrick.... It's about time to get the next white hope ready... 😅😅😢
I wish the thumbnail didn't spoil the result
Ill never watch a Redskin game till they change their name back!
As a diehard bengals fan, were cooked
Watching Jayden beg his coaches while they’re ahead by multiple scores to stay on the field on 4th and 4…and then  watch him convert, and then a beautiful TD? Ice in his veins. Have yourself a day Daniels.
1st Bengal td demonstrated the NFL rule that black players  must perform stupid jiggy little dances.
Jayden Daniels … sir I am a FAN! What a game young man
#HTTR!!!! So excited for you JD!! So excited for you team!! Stay healthy!! Stay strong!! Finish!!
Hi
Id say im surprised except burrow barely wins 50% of his starts anyway.
NFL = arena league now.  No defense, no punting, weird kickoffs. Pinball football.  80s 90s nfl was real football
Bengals are back to Bangels
Happy for Washington and the new ownership. Nice to see they are a functional franchise again. Red zone issues cost the Bengals tonight.
JD clearly the best QB of this draft
I wish my colts had a QB that could complete easy passes 😢
Let's hear how Cinc. was robbed.  You losers always have an excuse.
As a diehard cards fan your seeing it wasn't Kingsbury. It was a lack of a QB who can make plays happen!
We played as well offensively as possible, and still went down to the wire.  Two very poor teams.  Will be lucky to win 8 games.
As a 30 year fan of the Washington Redskins/Commanders, I feel that if they can build around JD5, and give him better O line play and better defense, we have a legitimate Franchise QB. I am truly happy.
Crazy how that was a pass interference in the end zone but it wasn’t when the chiefs did it 💀💀
Great game
LSU made good QBS
JAYDEN DANIELS IS THE TRUTH
The Bungles are back! So happy to see them with this big comeback!
The hype is real, let's go Jayden 🔥🔥
man..who really saw the Bengals being 0-3? I sure didnt...2-1 at worst was my prediction...0-3 isnt an impossible hole to climb out of..but if they slip t0-4, they might as well start taking trade request for Higgins and start planning for the 2025 draft
Washington doesn’t have a president. But at least we have a QB!
The MVP of the game should go to the offensive coordinator. His play calling was so unpredictable that the Bengals defense didn't know who to focus on. Andy Reid would be proud.
I didn't see this coming from the Commanders.
Keep telling yall these teams only get hype and serious when they play Pat Mahomes.
If Washington ruins Daniels like they did RG3 😤😤😤
Oh Cincinnati you are 0-3
Possibly the greatest game ever played by a QB. Wow!
Bengals should sit Burrow the rest of the season as it is over for them.
SHOUTOUT THE QUES!
Best mnf of the year so far 😅😅😅 and so fun to watch the commanders seemed to be havin fun out there you can hear em laughing and all love it
I bet the bengals wish they had paid their two former Safteys. Daniels had a completion percentage of plus 90… that’s nuts!
called a DPI on the same very play the chiefs did not get called on coincidence I THINK NOT
Two mentions. Loved the Trent Scott TD. reminded me of the Bears heyday when they let Refrigerator Perry take one in. Also, great to see another young star QB  in JD. I do not understand teams signing old geezers (the Jets) when there is so much talent out there.
Look, I’m a cowboys fan, but even I was happy to see JD ball out like that
only 3 games in its way too soon to declare Jayden "elite" or say he is better than Caleb Williams in Chicago - but Redskin fans will do so anyway
Snyder can’t mess this one up at least
LSU fans tried to tell y’all Jayden was the truth lol
JD might be what analyst thought Caleb was supposed to be
What the hell happened to Cincinnati? I was rooting for them this year..is joe burrow hair color i think 😂😂
All respect to the commander, but bengals defensive front line had no pressure. They are awful
Daniels > Williams
I will always love that ASU let Jayden Daniels go lol (UA Wildcats fan here). And then he became the Heisman winner and looks to be better than Caleb Williams
Finally someone to throw Terry Mclarin some TD’s😂💯
Genuinely happy for the commanders, JD is legit, you either got it or you don’t , wish the Miami dolphins could figure that out 😢
Two bad defenses…no punts, no turnovers, no pass rush, ouch!
Bengals, team to beat in the AFC, proving it through 3 games 😁
I remember watching Colin Cowherd earlier in the day say how the Bengals were going to win this game easily.  I think I could have suited up and played better defense than they did. Daniels was great but it looked like he was going against backups in a preseason game.
perhaps Joe should focus more on playing better than his appearance, dying his hair blond for the cameras
Ordinarily not a "Washington" fan but I have to say that Daniels is looking impressive!  At least "someone" appears to be in command in DC!!
Stephanie Overpass
Bruhh took me a few seconds to remember the darn team name after typing in redskins at first 😂
it’s one thing to have a bad nfl offense, it’s concerning to have a high sho defense playing in the nfl
Look at this dudes oline man. Putting in work like they’re 20 million dollar men. Bengals on paper have the better oline and they can’t stop a fly from landing on joe burrow 90% of the time.
The Blonde Burrow's Bengals Show...3 Games 0 Wins🤬
Howe Lodge
Jayden Daniel’s > Caleb Williams
What a shitty defense Cincinnati has. Im hoping, they will still pull it through... but i doubt it, with this defensive line.. :/
Very proud of my Skins, but they need to do better at tackling the rest of the season.
no turnovers & no punts in the game, first time thats happened since 1940
Dude! 8 man blitz? Toss an amazing ball to your best playmaker to seal it? JD is real
The battle of LSU quarterbacks was nice. Glad daniels got the win
We all thought it was another slow start, but upset week 2.0 has made us one of the winless teams in the league. If it continues WHO DEY NATION WHOS READY FOR THE FIRST PICK AGAIN
Let me guess it’s the refs fault again Cincinnati 😂😂😂
Its last two years the second pick qb is better than the 1st cj stroud better than young lol Daniel’s look better than caleb😂
11:33  Obviously the play of the night but shout out to Joe Buck for such a great call.  He gets a lot of flak but he’s one of the best commentators in football.
I told skin fan's on draft day...yall got yall quarterback
Looks like the Bengals "contender window" has closed
No turnovers or punts.  Defense needs to do more.
The Chiefs broke the Bengals and Joey Burrow
Jayden>Caleb
It’s the redskins btw, wtf is a commander
JAMAR CHASE 1 ST TUDDY FALLLING DREAMING TALKIN AINT NO SLEEPLING
Jayden Daniels is truly elite wow what a game
I love that the Bungholes were upset at home & drop to 0-3 on natl tv. Redskins get the W
Ja’Marr Chase said the Bengals are the team to beat in the AFC before they played the Chiefs. Now they’re 0-3 😂😂
Watching the bills game in the corner. Everytime I look over buffalo has put up more points on the jags
wash won the QB lottery
Love how the Bengals seemed to have nothing but respect and admiration for young Jayden after the game. That’s saying a lot after they’re now 0-3… pure anger and frustration would be my go-to.
Those TD throws couldn’t get any better. Dimes
Daniels is on his way to being HIM
This game looked wild.
who day!  go bangles
Excellent game by the skins but their defense has got to stop giving up 30+ points a game!
Impressive!  Overall insane game by Daniels.  Best rookie showing so far, by a mile.
It’s embarrassing
The commanders won this game on 4th downs
Bengals are so bad
The Bears GM should update his resume.
As an LSU fan, I've been conflicted about this game for the last week! I love both of our Heisman winners and I want them both to succeed. But...I admit I was pulling for Jayden just a lil' bit more. Congrats Jayden, and congrats Redskins!
まさかベンガルズが開幕3連敗するとはな。今年もNFLは予想外のことが起きておもしろい。
The Steelers & Ravens fans are definitely smiling today 😊. Thank you Commanders!!!
Bengals always seem to get going late. They have potential though.
No one is talking about Austin Ekeler, he looks like he’s gotten much faster later in his career.
Bengals 0-3? Biggest surprise
Awesome game
I hope the Commanders build a team around him, he will bring them a ring like Doug Williams if so.
So is the Bengals defense that bad or are the commanders good this year?
I guess I am old school and like the era where the quarterback didn't do a dance in the endzone and the entire teams don't run all together to the end zone when they intercept the ball and are down.  I get it that most people are now about to write a reply saying, "let them play and have fun."  Imagine if an entire baseball team ran the bases with a guy that just hit a homerun or the entire hockey team did laps around the ice on every score.  I just think it is too WWE and cheesy.  Just an old guy former athlete and lifelong sports fanatics opinion.
looks like the team to beat is getting beat lol
It's easy to forget but teams like Jags, Bengals are snakebit. In 100 years with different personell they will still have the same narrative.
Lsu kid making big kid moves!!!
The experts had the bengals in the top 5 this year I use to scratch my head saying why. Funny now they are in the bottom 5
They need to call those pass interference calls on Kansas City
Burrow looks scared and jumpy. I wonder if he has lost his edge?
Let’s gooooooo ik my team is gonna win this game cause I believe in them
CHIEF 10 WINS..SAYS.."10 WINS"   BABY ! We will be at least 4/2 in the div ..maybe 5/1..
Is this what it feels like to have a franchise QB?? tears of happiness..
His father saying thats my son was golden
Way to go bungles. Cheap out in the offseason when you have a window of opportunity to win when you have burrow and chase and tee, etc. Taylor is a terrible head coach and play caller. If two DT’s missing causes your defense to be this bad you are done!
As a Bengals hater THANK YOU COMMANDERS!! told all them lame Bengals fan don't talk football to me no more they're not qualified. They called my Patriots and The Commanders "easy" wins. Now look at em 0-3😂😂😂
Who are Commanders?  Is there no more Redskins?
Rg3 2.0
What a difference it makes to a rookie QB, if they have a good OL blocking the run and pass game for them!
We know who the real LSU QB is now 😮
Burrow is overrated
Good to see washington back in business again ❤️💛
Chase makes playing wide receiver look effortless. #beast
Let’s go 0-17 bengals
Commanders this is an impressive win! Keep it up!
LSU!!!!
The only team Cincinnati gets up for is when they play KC.
There is this weird feeling in my heart and mind.  Something i've not felt in many years as a Redskins/Football Team/Commanders fan....Hope.  Do I dare to let that hope grow...
The last touch down is the first time I’ve ever heard Joe Buck sound excited for a play, great job Commanders!
i’m so happy for my commanders i just want everyone that was taking crazy on us keep that same energy 🔥
Best game of the season so far
Jayden Daniels has potential to be what RG3 was supposed to have been, if it wasn't for injuries.  Praying for longevity and success his way 🙏🏾
pretty sure a little league defense is better than what the commanders got
Did Scott keep the ball
As a commanders fan since 2012 all the way from brazil, i am really happy we have a qb
The angle of the clip after the first TD went hard especially with the whole stadium
Daniels threw them numbers up last night let’s GOOOOOOOO  Washington 🔥🔥🔥🔥
JD out here looking like Lamar
What a game
Daniels had Madden stats
Please stop spoiling the game in the thumbnail. Some of us are watching because we missed the live game
Heismen thoughts and outside routine. Look at this catch 53:30:16
I’m an Eagles fan but if I’d have to have a soft spot for one team in the division it’s always been Washington. I’m happy to see them. Find their man behind Center. He played lights out and should  get offensive player of week for his performance!!!
Given there were no punts, the final score is surprisingly low.
He's basically Lamar with a higher ceiling..... And i am saying this as a fan of Lamar.
Time to fire the coach Cinci
Ima big fan of Jayden but I hate the commanders so bad that I hope he don’t accomplish anything with that stupid team
14 minutes of highlights requires 6 commercial breaks!?!? WTF NFL?!?! UNSUBSCRIBE!!
If Washington keeps doing this well, then very soon commanders may win their first Super Bowl
Wunsch Trail
Jayden  proven why he’s the #2 pick in the draft
Lmao  “Bagel Egg not Burrow”
Love watchin the redskins.
Typical Bengals,  play tough against my Chiefs and get lose against another team.
12:49 they called a p.i but in the falcons vs chiefs game same situation but no flags 😂😂 refs kingdom dominating again
LOL at the pathetic Bengals kicker #2 literally did his best to avoid tackling the Commanders player on the kickoff return.
🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡❤️‍🔥💟🎱
He’ll do great like Heineke and then we will trade him for big money
Troy Aikman really loves his job 😂
"Commanders"... This team lost all credibility with that change.  The big W along with the rest of the uniform design looks like a college team design.  Creativity was out for lunch for those discussions.
Time to break out my Who Dey paper bag.
And people really thought Cincinnati would be better than Pittsburgh this season?!?! 😅😅😅😅
Hey every blind squarral finds a nut so im not impressed with the best checkdown quuaterback in the nfl daniels isnt good so stop already
While everyone was paying attention to Caleb.. jayden was quietly learning his job. ...I know it's early but does anyone else get a good laugh when looking at the nfc east standings n seeing Dan quinns commanders on top of the cowboys😂
Ayyyye with the thumbnail
Tua and Skyler are watching that O-line and just sobbing
Daniels did well tonite but I'm still not a fan and he's a check down qtr back at best
Jayden Daniels future ROTY
Win is what matter.
11:50 no touch-down
We not going to bring up how Washington’s o-line was holding the entire game and never got called for it?
What did Washington have to trade to get literally all of the chargers offense in one trade?
I like the victory but WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP THAT DEFENSE.
Hell of a game by Daniels!!!
So interesting how far off all of these "professionals" are sometimes. Haven't heard two words about the potential of Daniels out the gate, but Caleb Williams was going to put the bears straight into the playoffs
bengals this is getting upsetting ur losing 0-3 again
Stay HEALTHY Jayden, the league needs playmakers like you at QB!!!!
All the laughingstock teams from the early 2000s on the come up now 🥹🥹 so happy
I’ve been saying Daniel’s is better than Caleb, it was pretty obvious he was. Washington got a good one.
Never thought the Bengals would be 0-3 at the start of the season
This was a well played game by both teams. It was just Daniels’ night.
Commanders fan here I’ll be buying my Daniels jersey tomorrow
I knew jayden was Goin to do hood in the nfl! He's goin to get rookie of the year
What are the Bengals going to blame it on this week? 🤔
Jayden Daniels looks good, but the Bengals Defense is awful, they will go nowhere with defense like that, idc who they got on Offense.
people forget this was a LSU vs LSU QB battle. I had a feeling Jayden had a chip on his shoulder.
It appears that in 2024 Cincy can't beat teams with black quarterbacks lol
Jayden Mfn Daniel’s !! ROTY
Tell you what, Trent Scot is going to be a very interesting trivia answer someday!
As a Steelers fan this gave me a good ol fashioned chuckle.
Play calls & execution  favored  Washington.
Love to see an O Line get a TD catch
Bengals aren’t even bad. They just got out played
Today we learned the patriots are definitely not good.
I just hate that both teams played great if they had played most other teams then they would have won
As a Washington fan,the progression and development over 3 games for JD5 is amazing.First and first half of the second game,he would run all over the place,not take his time in the pocket,and run head first into big hits.Now,he trusts his recievers and throws way more,Including finally throwing some deep balls.The future is bright.HTTC baby
Looks like the Bears should have drafted Daniels.
This would be a great time to change it back to REDSKINS
NFL thumbnails always gives away which team has won. Very poor.
At least the bengals look good when they lose
What a game! Some of the best NFL runs, passes and catches I’ve seen all year! And I’m from KC. Move over Patrick! Congrats to Daniels and company, they showed up big time.
Daniels is Art.
I wanna get on the wagon.
Daniel’s really impressed
the best washington game in some time.
Are the bengals finished?
Are Defense needs to step up especially the secondary
They definitely took that OL play from the lions vs cowboys game 🤣
I agree with the comments I believe the Bengals personnel is too high on themselves and greedy for money since Bengals establish. This is the worst start for the football team with high price players that do very little money will make them talk and make him feel better, but it doesn’t make him perform better.
Hahaha I have to start re-thinking my parlays now. A lot of surprise teams are starting to show up at the party.
I wish they'd stop revealing the results in the thumbnails.
The REDSKINS won?
So sad to loose another game man:/ we been tryin so hard
Bengals are bad.
Daniels young  Bull 💪
Good ol Bungles
Very good game
Congrats to Commanders nation, I hope you got your QB!!! This was a helluva game!!!
Did not expect the Redskins of all teams to be at the top of the division heading into week 4.
As a commies fan THIS IS AMAZING
The Bengals starting the season 0-3 warms my heart.
explain how one team of officials called the same play pass interference on washington  and almost the exact play not called on Kc today  the nfl is so fixed
Love watching the Bills vs Jags score slowly get out of hand 😂
the head coach for the Bengals need to be fired them mfs to soft hey that conservative  bs play calling not gone. Get it anymore
Too little too late again for Bengals.
Let's go
I see Luke finding him place to Goodshit Washington
Good for commanders fans
Is too early to say Jayden is for real?
Could you hide that "Live on ESPN" floating score from another game... Here in Europe we have to be hiding from the scores lol.
The way the black people celebrate in the end.Can't say this in the air.Or I can't put it in front but in my mind , I know what they are
Why does ESPN insist on broadcasting the scores other games while watching a game? I like to record the other games then watch them later but can't do that because they give away the scores ahead of time. It's like giving away the ending of the movie.
I wasn't going to watch because I don't care about these teams but I'm glad I did. Good game!
I had to look at this again to make sure I wasn't dreaming 😂😂😂
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Great win
same play cheifs did.. and atl did not get the pi. nfl is rigged
Good Job love it
Anyone see the "COMMANDERS COMMANDERS" at 0:00¿
Looking forward to watching Jayden against the Cardinals next week 😊
RG4 spirit was runnin thru Jalen cuz WTFFFF
Go Commanders 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
Bengals season over time to tank
Them LSU Boys can ball 🏈
As a Giants fan this makes me feel good. Washington couldnt score a single touchdown on us.
Remember people Bengals are "team to beat" 😂😂😂
Who dey? Dey 0 - 3! 😂😂😂 Ravens take down the Cowboys. In return, the Commanders take down the Bungles. Nice working with you fellas. 🤝🏽
Daniels legend began tonight. Phew boy
Not a commanders fan but a big time LSU Tigers fan and seeing both our Heisman QB’s play was nice. Bengals and Commanders are teams I really want to succeed
I stopped following Washington after '21 but this is exciting to watch, new owner whole new team, just need some defensive play makers & some more help in running the ball
5:07  please tell me that’s JDs father like 🤗 “that’s my kid, that’s my kid” in the middle of a bunch of angry Bengals fans
Daniels wasnt even running, which was his only strengh accoring to this draft card lol
Nobody celebrates their individual acheivements........while taking an L like a bengals player. An easy team to hate.
Washington finally has a quarterback
As a chiefs fan this is heartwarming
Bengals’s defense is nonexistent.
Hate when the refs effect the game the no call on the 2 point conversion was pitiful
Cincinnati  0-3  it’s getting serious even it’s a slow team start
At 6'4, with his elusiveness and deep ball accuracy, ball placement, there was a generational talent in the draft this year. It wasn't Caleb Williams it was Jaden Daniels!!!!
Wash skins gonna beat the sheagles at least once ..
#firezactaylor
Who Dey going to beat them bengals 😂
Daniels is fun to watch
Commies got a team this year!
To the average football guy, this was a great game…if you are a Bengal, this one hurts and if you are a Commander, you GOT to feel good!
Its wild how Elker was scoring 2 tuds a game for years and now he's a backup to another RB and a QB 3rd option Bro scores at will and hes the 3rd fn option
Jayden Daniels>Caleb Williams
I wonder what Joe did with his hair this week
Now can we finally flush Joe n da Bengals down the TOILET!?!?!?  PLEASE! No more of Cincinnati being this Top AFC team. Finally....go AWAY!!!! TY.
Just a shame Joe "pass issssssssssssss" Buck called the game. Please, retire already!
Good game
Time to face it. Bengals just aren't an elite team.
Bengals secondary are weak tacklers and teams are exposing that
The boos when Tee Higgins caught the ball is so funny
The Commies socializing the Bengals!
Bengals fan tears are the best kind of tears 😂😂😂😂
Jayden with the Himmy award Bro is Him
Any  players on defense show up for either tonight?
The thumbnail is peak cinema.  HTTC
Looks like Washington has a quarterback
The proud dad moment was amazing 5:04
Daniels is gonna be a problem omg that boy good..
Burrowhead isn't in KC, heck it's not even in Cincy now. Always a lot of yacking from them, esp Chase and Britt, with little to show. Chase refuses to say Mahomes name, classless and juvenile compared to the professionalism of PM. They need to shut their pie holes and win some games, and esp some SBs before they start that up again. Good luck w/that
Next week probably Andy Dalton and the Carolina Panthers might get a piece.of. Bengals meat too😁
The offensive line for Washington is elite
Bengals defense without Jessie Bates lmao
Go redskins!!!!!!!!!!!
Loooooong time Washington fan here, I was concerned that the coaching staff had seen stuff that was making them keep JD on a leash during the first couple of games.  What a breath of fresh air this games was, hats off to JD and to the coaches.  There were some fantastic passes in here, the 2 to Scary Terry, one deep down field in the 2nd quarter and the TD pass in the 4th, were things of beauty. Have a spring in my step today, hopefully he can do something similar against the Cards in week 4.
This was a Heisman mini Super Bowl game. Well played on both sides but congrats #JD5 #GeauxTigers...
In taking the panthers over the bengals next week😂😂😂😂
Coaching won this game, plus excellent QB play...they went for the victory, played aggressive!!
That last touchdown pass by Daniels is actually insane for a rookie, 30+ yards to a perfect spot in the back corner of the end zone while taking a absolutely huge hit so he had to rush the throw as well, absolutely beautiful!
Daniels > Prescott
JD is the real deal
Daniels is the commanders savior
HTTR
As a football fan, they will always be The Washington Redskins. Not this Commanders BS!.
The Redskins looked good tonight.
No turnovers or punts. Also, no defense 😂
Bengals look to good to be 0-3
Aight so can we end the bengals glazing now
The redskins played great
As a life long Skins/Commanders fan, all I can say is we finally have a QB.
JD5 HAS ARRIVED 😂🔥🔥🔥💪🏿
What happened to the Bengal's defense? I've never seen it get rocked this bad from a below average team since Burrow got to the Bengals.
Bet them boys at ASU still jealous of Jayden Daniel’s talent lol
Redskins are looking like a team this year, well done Redskins
Oh No Chicago fans our GM drafted the wrong quarterback AGAIN!
Jaydennn !!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
white boys are mad, lmaooo!!!!!!
Jayden Daniels is like a Lamar Jackson but more of a Natural passer with the ball 🎯😮‍💨
Jaydennnnn Danielsssss
Typical wjite man, get tid of the Indian an keep the rest!!!!!!
Bengals play calling is absolutely pathetic!
Is this a Scorigami??
I like how they can call dpi in the last minute of the game against every team but the chiefs
Jayden Daniels is very impressive. What a great game! I am a Chiefs fan but I gotta root for him, always great to see a young player doing so well!
Daniels is who all of yall thought Williams was. And it shouldnt be surprising. He was better than him in college also.
Jayden Daniels a million times better than Caleb Williams
HTTC.
As a Packers fan, I would once again like to personally thank Chicago for choosing the wrong draft pick.
Nfl as someone who wakes up for a 5 am shift can you guys just put the 2 teams as the main picture it's annoying going to bed then wanting to watch these games but then seeing the winners as the picture for the video
My LSU boys going head to head, couldn't ask for a better game.
I still feel the Bengals will turn it around ...they are the best 0-3 team in the league...
Daniel's looked like a franchise quarterback in that game. Commanders can run the ball too behind a strong OL. Impressive.
God I'm so far behind I've just found out they aren't the redskins anymore😂
Great game by daniels!! Surprising to see that P.I call late, I could swear I saw something like that happen yesterday and it wasn’t called as such🧐
When the true redskin fans that been suffering for years we here baby !
Niw this was a game of football, brilliant match 👏
And that’s why I wanted the Patriots to get Jaden Daniel’s
JD stood in the pocket and delivered the game sealing TD . Took a big hit Noone mentioned too
His 1st td to a tackle
This was truly an LSU game tonight. LETS GO COMMANDERS
best rookie performance ever? that was legendary
Kliffs offense finally in groove. This is what the air raid looks like when you have a dedicated, talented, passionate, qb that’s willing to put in work.  Did y’all see how giddy Daniels was on the sidelines?  Dude loves this game.
Washington DC lets go...
Jayden Daniels looks sharp out there. Accurate and no turnovers. He’s gonna be great.
Interesting DPI call at the end. I wonder at what game this week I saw something similar? Maybe even this Sunday... Hmmm
what a performance by daniels and the washington team. brilliant gameplan, executed well above expectation. outstanding result , upset of the week . Go Skins.
The 4th quarter PI called on the Commanders wasnt even that bad... Look at the Falcons non called PI Vs the Chiefs X10 worse not called
A bit surprised by the Redskins, granted it’s not amazing but still surprised
Change back the name………REDSKINS…….
The commanders are finally OK?  WOW!  They'll get knocked out in the playoffs, if they make it that far, but still.
I'm just here to see da Bruhz SSSO!! 🟣🟡🐶
lets go skins
Well mcclourin u finially got u a QB my guy cause only thing he needed was a  QB and now he has one bro been a low-key 1'000 plus yard receiver since he been in the league
Well, that outcome was a surprise. If the commandeers can maintain that level of offense and shore up the defense a bit, the playoffs will be winking at them in a few weeks.
Someone won 117 thousand dollars off that Jamar chase first touchdown scorer WOW 🤑🔥🤑🔥🤑
Quinn might be onto something, man. That o-line gon give teams hell and Jayden Daniels just put the league on notice 💪🏾
Im a bengals fan. Commanders got a good team , could surprise alot this year.  Future looks bright
They looking real dangerous those commanders
they should be called the redsines
Bengals are cooked
Washington’s quarterback reminds me of Randall Cunningham. His tall, slender, athletic build and smooth, flexible running style.
I’m a lions fan( been my whole life , yes that includes 0-16 when nobody liked us) but I like this commanders team! Daniel’s Sainristil and McCaffrey and gonna be good!!!  Ofc I like Sainristil GO BLUE 💙
HTTR
Commanders ain't playin
Defense still has a HUGE amount of eork to do. Way too much yards after catch, but Daniels is coming into his own with leading this offense!
Now that was a game! Great win for the commanders!
First NFL Game to go full 4 quarters with NO PUNTS nor turnovers since 1940 ? That is absolutely ridiculous  And uncharted territory for Cincinnati, their first 0-3 start in the Joe Burrow Era
My 90s Bengals are back!!!!
Love how Chase went to his alum
Are we ever going to win a game? 😒
now thats a game!!!💪
Commanders Nation
Daniels looks really good.
Ugh... the hell Bengals?
As the fantasy coach for the 3-0 team Saquon-a Man.... I'd like to thank Jayden Daniels for living upto all the hype. He stepped in and made my squad a juggernaut. Only complaint,  maybe rush a little more next time.😂     All jokes aside. As a Lions fan,  Dude is the real deal. Washington has themselves a 🌟
I feel sorry for that offensive lineman. He'll probably never get another TD catch, but couldn't get the ball because it's Jayden's first of his career.
I think I found my fave qb of this draft. It’s just how he looked, not so much the stats
Jayden Daniel’s, OMFG…
😂😂😂 Joe better get a new hair cup bum
Jayden Daniels if he stays healthy and keeps playing like he did tonight will be a nightmare the more comfortable he gets. You can tell he's calming down the past two games.
Please can the thumbnails stop spoiling the game.
Can you guys put both teams in the thumbnail so we don’t know who wins
How many gd commercials can they squeeze in 8 minutes.  I'm just gonna google the score and save 20 minutes of bs
Scary Terry was awesome tonight
They need to add this to the LSU qb recruitment pitch
This was the best game we’ve played in years
No turnovers or punts in a game since 1940; that's a good omen.
Man. I wish i could hear Joe's words to Jayden.
He’s already better than “Mr. Generational”, AKA Trevor Lawerence.
Joe Burrow we need some serious talks about him. Jayden Daniel’s is legit.
Shocked thats all i can say
Hail To The Redskins!!!
Wow. This game was insane. I did not expect this. The Redskins has not  been good for so many years literally ever since the Sean Taylor and Clinton Portis days. I would love to see them get back to that level of football for sure. This bengals win was definitely an impressive win and a good start for them to get back to how they once were. We’ll see how they hold up the rest of this season. I think they’re going to do well. 👍
If this o line can hold up and Jayden is balling out this team could be scary on offense secondary needs help..
Washington has great momentum. Fresh ownership, a young talented roster and a new stadium will be next. Good to see for a strong fanbase.
HTTR
Just so all you long time Skins fans are aware, our success generally occurs in blocks of 10 years.  This could be the start of something great.  But, the last time I really cheered for the Redskins was after Joe Gibbs retirement, the 1st time.  I'm a Redskin fan from a completely different era.  HTTR!!!
What happened with benglas defense?
I’m no commanders fan or bengals for that matter but dang Jayden Daniel’s is a franchise qb
Fake
Skins look great on offense..can't even hate on that performance
So that PI got called in the end zone but not Kyle pitts??
I think we should go back to a balanced game ima younging and some of these incomplete passes are just egregious
48 yard attempt and the guy missed it my a mile! Coach: you're fired! NO excuse!
Thats how you handle the bengals.. Good job commanders..
Females refn and calln games now
13:02 Cheifs did the same thing, but no penalty against them.
Both teams got No defense.
Jaden Daniels out there looking like Doug Williams with his style of passing and that mustache. This Washington team just might be a sleeper team in the NFC
Redskins have terrible defense!
Wow. What a great game by JD. He was incredible tonight. I pray his O line can protect him bc he's a special player
5 A PROBLEM
Commentary's top notch
KC scored on TACKLE Eligible, commanders must of seen thatga.e when Chiefs  beaten again !!
I don’t think Joe Burrow and Ja’marr Chase like one another.
Daniels outperformed Burrows
Jayden Daniels is a better RGIII, still cannot slide, but a better runner,  passer and decision maker
What did I just watch
Bengals Defense … yikes
0-3 bengals. Never thought I’d see that
The commanders played to win in this game
0-3 start for the Bengals. WOW! I'm shocked
kingsbury called an excellent offense for the commanders but that defense was horrendous.
What has happened to the Bangles. That was a disgraceful performance.
Forever they will always be the Redskins to me. Race never had anything to do with it.
Stayed up till 5am to watch this game,can't believe that we Redskins fans have hope...
WHO ARE THESE COMMANDERS!!!?  LFG!!!!
Philadelphia Eagles, y'all better watch out. There's a new sheriff in town and his name is Jayden Daniels!!
This Bengals team is an embarassement and a disgrace.
Just curious why in most nfl highlights yall need to make a point what kinda fan you are, just make your point. I don't see this in mlb mls nba or even nhl....."as a dodgers fan.....as a sounders fan....etc"
With the disgusting tax-payer funded "deal" the team has with the city, the fan base deserves to be miserable. But watching a peroxide-blonde Joe Burrow be al mopey and sad at a microphone is worth every broken tv and tear-streaming face.
Stop spoiling with thumnail!
Martinez Brenda Moore Jeffrey Martinez Linda
11:26 perfect throw and catch combined, props to Wash - great game
Washingtons defense is terrible
Jayden Daniel’s is the real deal wow…. Didn’t expect commanders to crush the bengals but here we are. Joe played out of his mind too but came just short due to his defense being torn up. They’re 0-3 bengals but they still look scary good. Props to the squad
What is up with bengals?
So much for any defence in this game!
Jayden Daniels vs Joe burrow was a good matchup I actually liked it
We haven’t had a qb this talented since rg3 and I hope we can keep him heathy….Jayden looks truly franchise changing so far
This was an excellent recap of the game.  Not a favor of showing players mugging for the cameras, but it was balanced by good play analysis.  Exceptionally well done, fellas.
Wtf was the kicker doing on ekelers return, just completely avoided tackling him. Was so obvious too didn’t even hide it
punters are the real winners tonight
and dallas fans was tryna say dan quinn was the problem smh
Washington redskins.
Commanders offense is improving but the defense is absolutely terrible
Jayden Daniels 🔥🔥
This looked closer than it was. Commanders in full control after being up by 15.
BRO I LOVE DANIELS SINCE LSU DAYS!!! Bro is a straight beast man!!! He reminds me of Winston a little bit just how he runs and stand in the pocket 😂😂😂
Daniel’s gonna be a problem n I’m a 🦅 s fan
O-3 for the bengals🤭🥃🃏
Why they wasting Jermain Burton
The redskins lead the division?!! Is this 1983?!😮
12:48, oh! So that IS pass interference...just not when the chiefs do it
Lions fan checking in, Looks like Washington found their Coach (Who needs a Bent Johnson anyway ?) and more importantly their QB. So far,  Daniels is the best rookie QB I have ever seen, no offense to Stroud. Seriously, Washington looks like the Team to beat in the NFC East. From what I can tell you guys should make short work of the Cardinals. They are beatable if you force Kyler to throw the ball, he puts a ton of air under his passes and their Oline is pretty beat up. Hard to sack Kyler but easier to intercept. Good luck on the rest of your season and if Daniels keeps playing like that enjoy your run at the Superbowl.
And just like that  the Bengals are 0 and 3 but it's a long season.
LSU alumni game lol
Why don't you wait and see if you win before you celebrate?  It makes you look childish.  They've taken "professional" out of sports.
It says Commanders Commanders instead of Washington Commanders lol
I just replay 4 times that 50 yards rainbow from Daniels
am i hallucinating or is the speed of this video slightly sped up (my playback speed is normal)
That was a "Doug Williams in the SuperBowl"-level performance by Jayden Daniels.
It’s games like this that make me want to have madden moments back.
Sometimes all we wanna see is a good game...Like THAT!
And my rookie qb is leading the league in sacks 😭
This is unbelievable! Onside Kick is impossible to do. In all these years no one has figured out how to change the rules?
Scary Terry: “Rumors of my demise were greatly exaggerated.”
Female referee's are a f'king joke.  Females have NO business in the NFL.  smh
Everyone progressing and evolving meanwhile Miami still running last century plays 😢
Whenever dumpsternatti loses, everybody wins!
Congrats to the Commanders defense for being absolutely carried, and apologies to the Bengals offense for that weight they call a defense being too heavy.
Having the score of the other game is so annoying
I'm glad the Redskins are doing good .
Jayden daniels is him
Why are the thumbnails different.. if you want to change it, at least keep them the same
Happy for the Redskins. I hope Daniels turns into an amazing QB.
One good thing about this for the bengals is that Burrow looked like Burrow again. 0-3 is tough.
Wow what a game, looks like the Bengals need to work on their defense.
HAIL!
Commanders defence was hitting
Daniels might be a ROY candidate.  He is already Da Man in DC.
Jayden's a real one
Chase is not him he can’t play with ourt Higgins first game he broke out in a losing effort nothing like Jefferson
Bengals defense failed to show up to the game..
Jayden really showed something tonight. The NFC East is on notice. Washington always plays my Eagles tough, very impressive.
Jayden Daniels is a gift from the heavens for the Commanders.  We are winning the Super Bowl within the next 5 seasons.
5:03 proud dad w
I am an English Man who loves to watch this game, however i do not like watching grown supposed tough guys dancing around with moves which would make the Village People say "bit limp".
Wow Jayden Daniels already better than burrow
Benny the Ball Hawk was all over the field tonight and they never said his name once.
Better than daniel penny jones
Why are the Bengals all dancing when they score, they are down and are 0-2. Need to be humble either way.
He is the truth and I’m eagles fan 😂😂
Should’ve kept mixon. He would’ve opened up the pass game. When they broke the team up they broke the chemistry. If a team makes it to the Super Bowl keep ‘em. Sometimes when you change one thing you change everything
Washington will win this division. Called it before the year. They by far have the best coach and QB in it
2022 Bengals offense with 2019 Bengals Defense=a long season. If they can't be Carolina,  then id try and trade Tee and Hendrickson to get draft Capitol for next year. Embarrassing.
Love it. And shoutout to all the Experts that put the Steelers last in the North. 😂
I couldn't watch this week because I work the night shift at a dog kennel doing baths and nail trims that typa stuff.  I was so hype when I saw the notification pop up with the final score because I was unsure we could beat the Bengals!  Hail to the Commanders.  I'm finally watching the game now.  WHO DEY WHO DEY WHO DEY SAY GONE BEAT THEM BENGALS?!  WE DID!  WE DID!  It was the two year anniversary of my third album drop 'Year 22: The World Trade Show' so the DMV was celebrating a lot today.  It's sold 5.38M copies now and I'm still broke!  Woohoo at least my team is good.  Fifth Album drops in October.  HAIL TO THE COMMANDERS!
Thanks for the Jaguars x Bills spoiler.
The „team to beat in the AFC“ is 0-3. love to see it
Welp, it’s clear who the best QB in the draft was.
The Bengals got nothing on Chiefs Kingdom!
at 13:52: that look of humble respect of Daniels for Burrow may teach something to Caleb Williams.
uhmmm
As an ASU fan this makes me happy.
How was this game penalty whise?
Are the Commanders sneaky good? 😲
They're playing a washed up Bengals team.  Come on guys😂
If I was Daniel’s father I would’ve pointed down at my nuts and said “that’s me, that’s me” 😂
“It was all a fluke I used to read bengals magazines, joe burrow and jemarr up in the limousine”
Such a shame Washington had to change their name as the Red skins was such a cool name
Jayden Daniels you’re my hero
Trent !! RQQ
Officially back to the same ol bengals i grew up w... always losing close games. I knew their superbowl run 3 years ago was just a fluke
As a eagle.fan this makes me nervous😳
Skins finally got a QB copped D best QB in the the 2024 NFL Draft! Not 🐻‼️
HTTC!!!
Chase at the start what a touchdown 👍
The Bengals are always good for a disappointment.
Why do the Bengals only show up when it’s time to play the Chiefs
As an LSU fan, I was proud of both quarterbacks. Two ultra-cool customers. Cincy knows what they have. Washington found out tonight.
A star in born, this dude is the "Real-Deal"
Both defenses could have not taken the field, and I think the score would have been lower.😂😂😂
Had mayweather jr fought Paqiau in 2012 when paqiau was still elite, Pacqiau would have DESTROYED mayweather jr.
How could the chargers let go of eckler?
HTTR
Bengals season is over
Dan Quinn defense is gonna be reason they don’t make the playoffs😂😂
Give Washington back his real name. Washington Redskins🔥
It's gotta be the Refs 😅 NFL is rigged😂😂😂   Daniels what a game son🎉
Hell yea let’s go Jayden Daniel’s putting San Bernardino on map🫡💯
Great win for Commanders. Defense needs work tho.
"Bruh, Bengals are down 0-2, they are at home, they gonna show up and blow out the Commmanders, easy cover ..."
Man everyone sleeping on Jayden Daniels lol beat Joe Borrow when Josh Allen couldn’t lol
REDSKINS
Still the Redskins to me
Jayden daniels > 2024 Draft class
Daniels played totally better from last week to this week. Played like a well oiled machine
What’s up with the bengals 🤔
ekeler has been a beast this year lol
It looks like the Bengals will end up 8-8 or 7-9 at best.
man this hurt as i love seeing joey b and jamar lose but i also love seeing daniel’s win
Good job by the punters, should give them a raise.
Ngl man this just shows how that the Bengals have to pay both Chase and Higgins somehow, both of them help Burrow a ton. Either that or have Burton fill out for Higgins spot since they’ll most likely sign Chase if he’s the only one they can get.
we clearly know whos the real and better heisman.
Cincinnati still 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
Imagine being obsessed with the Chiefs but you failed to win your games. A shout out to the Commanders for Showing up! JD had a great game.
I love seeing teams being aggressive on 4th it’s a big reason why they won
Look out Cardinals.  Trouble coming 😮😮😮😮.  Good luck Washington 👍
nfl highlights 2024 all file
Always enjoyable to see the Bangles lose.
Good to see the Redskins get the W! Yes, I said REDSKINS!
Didnt realize what weapons Washington has on offensive. Zach Ertz, Terry McLaurin, Austin Ekeler. If everyone stays healthy and Daniels keep’s performing, they’ll have relatively quietly put together a rather impressive offense.
Daniels doing for $10mil per year what Dak Prescott can't do for $60mil per year.
I guess that's it for the Bengals.  I swear, I wouldn't be paying my quarterbacks like this.  Just get someone that's functional.  I guarantee this defense is gonna be ranked bottom 3 in most categories by the end.
6:13 dude Ekeler is slow as hell😂😂😂😂😂😂
11:56 funniest cameraman reaction 😂
Electric
Great game! Well played. Tough loss for The Bengals.
Daniels looked like a vet in that game.
Bengals fan gonna say the ref help the commanders to win 🤣🤣, as a chiefs fans cheers 🍻 to 0-3 bengals 🤪
let's gooo Washington Commanders
Zac Taylor should have been fired years ago clown show disaster of a head coach 💯
Sirianni would’ve never tried to score that last TD. He would’ve tried to run clock and lost
Great game, 0-3 for the bengals is rough, washington leading the nfc east is surprising, love the poise their qb played with in this game. He dropped some straight dimes 2
Bengals are jus a slow pace football team it’s not working nomore
What has happened to Cincys defense?
Jayden Daniels is unreal
Jayden Daniels played a heck of a game. Must be in rare company who's 1st career TD pass is to an O-Lineman!!
joe burrow so awkward
Script writers had a ball with this one
ROTY!!!
Could have been the Giants QB. 😒
Trent’s dance lol a linemen’s dream to catch a TD. I never touched the Bball ever lol 🥲 I was nice tho don’t sleep on me
first great game this season ; the quality of play this year has been abismal
Cincinnati defense is terrible
That's the type of QB the boys need like either one of them but someone like Daniels
That last pass to Mclaurin was majestic af
Skins looked very impressive tonight. Great game!!!
hi friends! I'm Brazilian, I would like to know if you Commanders fans still use the name Redskins in your country? I'm from Brazil, a fan of the commanders, I have old shirts with the old logo, would there be any problem wearing the shirt? A simple curious question. I thank.
That catch from Terry is insane
My brother passed in march. He was such a loyal Washington fan. I wish he could see his team doing good❤ makes my heart happy and sad at the same time
Superb game best of year so far well done both teams but can we have redskins back please
90's Bengals 😂
Looking more poised than the overhyped Caleb Williams IMO
Joe burrow is an average QB who happens to have elite wrs
As a Steeler fan, I’m happy as hell for Washington and its fan base. Your future is bright with Daniel’s and Quinn on command. This was genuinely a game for the ages.
If the Bengals go  0-4 to start this Season Of,then I say No playoffs.Just my Opinion! 🤔
I give the credit to the Commanders OL they stood on business
@NFL: European fan here - i'd kindly like to ask, please consider removing/covering the game score of the parallel game. I rely on watching highlights the following day & I would like to take it one clip at a time without spoilers...
Daniels just won OROTY in one outing.  Dag boi!
If that was pass interference then I dunno why the other call in the Kansas game was not?
Daniel son is a great quarterback 💪
Is this the birth of Daniels???
So the proper term would be "no interceptions or punts". Or just say no punts. That's already bananas enough lol
Commanders offense was great. Defense was awful. The secondary is a disaster area: the coverage and tackling is just not good enough.
OLine man Trent getting a TD was dope.6:40
That last Wash TD was no good he didnt get both feet down
Daniel’s has a great deep ball
The Redskins looked great tonight
wait wtf is mccaffrey doing in washington????
Surprise to see W...get the W..!!!   Awesome!
Kliff offense is legit in college pat couldn’t make some of those play and Kyler wasn’t on point in AZ  he finally has a QB that can see over the Oline and don’t play COD all day  Washington is in good hands
Does Scary Terry finally have the QB he’s deserved his whole career?
Stop making thumbnails that give away the ending.
HAIL TO THE PALESKINS
dang, I've never seen DC this polished
So apparently Trent Scott is a Q-Dog. Luv it!!!
Jayden Daniels is looking good for a rookie!
This game felt exactly like madden 25 game against Washington with my Bengals franchise
wow jay d
That last TD was a dagger to the heart of bengal fans.... Well played rookie👍👍
The Bungles escapades continue. Gonna be a long season.
Really impressive from Daniels. No way that Bengals lineup should be 0-3. Crazy.
I will be watching this at least 7 times this upcoming week
Could we finally be able to start washing the stink off the Daniel Snyder era?  This gives me hope!
Im really happy for the commanders and all the fans. Daniels looks stunning!
Bengals being 0-3 was not on my bingo card this year.
Wow! 0 and 3 bengals
THE COMMIES AIN'T GOIN NOWHERE won;t even make playoffs the game was scripted for Bengals to take the L  obviously Rigged  because Wash needs to build that fanbase up again you idiots don't understand business in the NFL they cany afford another bad season but  they  will still end 6 and 10 so yall fools need to chill lol next week they will be crying Last week  Giants had more fans in Washington  than the Commies  embarrassing
Scary Terry is back!
Redskins looking good.
first game since 1940 without a punt or a turnover is INSANE though
I've got just into NFL. Tell me in Hockey words what happened in this game and why it was such a good game for Commanders? I had a bet on Commanders win and it pulled through. Nice!
Man Joe burrow throws a nice ball. Just aesthetically perfect throws, constantly
Go Commanders aka Redskins
so the bengels are the worst team in the league this season
Redskins baby
Amazing last TD
Jayden Daniels was the best waiver pick up for my fantasy team I've ever made
The Bengals all bark no bite
🏈🏈🏈
We’ll take that W a long way to go and real fans know we can’t get ahead of ourselves just yet😂
Seeing Bengals being at 0-3,feels like Christmas came earlier.
STOP giving away the result in the thumbnail NFL
Dem Bayou boys. We make em DIFFERENT DOWN HERE. NFLSU!! GEAUX JOE AND JAYDEN, GEAUX TIGERS 🐅
Long-suffering Bengals fan here. I love my team and yeah, they start slow under Taylor/Burrow, but let's remember while we're trying to "stay positive," after finishing last in the AFC North in 2023, Cincinnati faces the fourth-easiest schedule in 2024.
Zach Ertz catches on a clutch 3rd and 10 for the second time in the game..am I watching an Eagles game?
Just like the last season, Bengals has started their season with a defeat and three consecutive defeat. Now it’s really hard for them to clinch any playoff spot at the end of the season.
Daniels was great, and Bengals... 0-3 😮
Relax everyone it's week 3 - Ever hear of Robert Griffin III ? NFL Rookie of the year in 2012 and Heisman Trophy winner
Daniels was great, and Bengals... 0-3 😮
Daniels had a game for the ages! Wow!
Bengals are 0-3. Ravens are 1-2. So are the browns who just lost to the giants. Life is good
Bengals bungling as usual
Well our season ain’t looking so hot this year, very disappointing. Our defense is horrendous.
@NFL can you please stop making the cover photo of your videos so obvious that it tells you who won the game. Some of us live in other countries and can’t catch a lot of these games live and I’d rather not find out who won until the end of the video, not before I even click on it. Do what the NBA does and just have 2 pictures of the top performers of that night from each team. Or just have a photo of the offense and defense on the field.
Bengals done already
Let’s go 🎉Commanders
Two former LSU quarter backs goin at it is a legendary game
As a cowboys fan we are so cooked
Media talking heads still have the Bengals in the top 10 power rankings ... probably.
😂 Burrowhead😂 More like Lhead. Or Nothinghead. Alwayshurthead. 0-3Head.
Daniel’s looked like a 10 year veteran out there, on the road against a good team that badly needed a win and he plays like that? More total touchdowns than incomplete passes? WOW
Congrats Washington Redskins !!!
stop putting the winner in the thumbnail it spoils every game
Bengals better beat the Panthers next week because in 2 weeks they host the Ravens.
Is it too early to say that the bears are salty?
Jayden Daniels my glorious fantasy king
Great game Commanders 🔥
Washington Offense Looking Nice Might’ve Just Found My  new madden team😭💯
I guess Cinci is just a bad team this year
He was supposed to be the raiders qb
Tried telling everyone Daniel’s was the best QB coming out of the draft. First 3 games in the NFL & he has one of the best deep balls.
NFL power rankings gonna be like. Ravens >>Bengals, 49ers, Dallas, > Seahawks xD
Going for two? Take the point!
Austin Ekler so tuff💯💯💯
Chicago is cursed
Thanks for spoiling the Jags-Bills result for me  🤬
WE GOT OUR GUYYYYYYYYYYY
ALL HAIL THE REDSKINS
Zero turnovers and Zero punts for the first time since 1940. Simply incredible. Awesome game. The Bengals are still elite, the defense and run game must step up to make the playoffs. Washington are well on their way. Good o-line, solid run game, young Qb and WR, good tight ends and an optimistic defense equals future success oh and smart play calling. BlessUp NFL. #JETSNATION4LIFE
Tress Way with the best job in the NFL the last two weeks.  Just holding for FGs and XPs.
The  Bengals cornerback called Washington's offense "Simple".. an yet they got burned by a OL touchdown pass, 50 yrd bombs and a walk in JD TD..... simple huh. 😂
Joe Burrow is one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and their offence is good. This Bengals team needs to start looking at adding key pieces to their defence, as they shouldn't be 0 - 3. No way, as they are way too good for that.
Bengals defence is worthy of high school calibre.
Thank you, Washington.
Washington has ZERO Pass Rush. Not a Super Bowl caliber team. LOL
Let's gooooooo Feels so good to be a Commanders fan!!!!
We got kliff, Austin, Jayden Daniels and no more Daniel Snyder.. 🔥 let's go.. it's been a long time coming
As a fan of football, it’s like a breath of fresh air to see the Commanders winning and relevant. It’s good for the league. Washington finally has a QB, and competent coaches who actually no how to coach. Daniel’s is only going to keep getting better💪🏾💯
Burrow hasn't won a game since he went super saiyan
Good stuff Washington
Can't wait to see the eagles defense destroy Daniel's they will be eatin good the sacks are coming
Jayden Daniels looking elite out here. Can't wait to see what he does in this league.
See what happens when you get rid of shitty ownership? I am impressed with this team's competitive attitude
Daniels in first place for OROY.
Thanks for putting the Bills vs Jags score up throughout the whole video spoiling it for me to watch next 👍🏼
0-3 🤦‍♂️
PI called on everyone this week except the chiefs lol who else is not surprised
There called redskins not commanders.
Hopefully the lawsuit against Washington and the NFL by the family of the man whose face was used as the redskins logo wins and forces Washington to go back to the Redskins. So racist of them to change their name to commanders. Dont know why Washington hates american indians
I’m glad Jayden finally figured out he has Terry on his team
Bengals man WTF
If I was commander’s fan this is tone setter for the rest of the season congrats on y’all’s QB man he’s gonna be great as a Steelers fan I really wanted him in the draft but knew it was impossible lmao but I like Justin so far but Jayden is breaking out already love his style of QB play!
Thats my qb… I could cry!
Daniels//Harris/Walz
Man Daniel’s reminds me of Rglll in his rookie season! Lots of people forget Rg3 had one of the best rookie seasons as a quarterback all time ! Daniel’s has it all !
Thank you, good job 👍
Kliff Kinsbury offense looks legit
That bengals defense is atrocious
I'm very impressed with the Washington Commanders.  They are playing better every week.
LSU HAS BEEN PUTTING STRAIGHT GAS IN THE NFL!
The browns and Bengals are the same shaking my head
Joe Burrow isn’t all that he’s pumped up to be, his receivers are always better than good and pretty big! Since college it’s been this way, but when you’re the next great white hope people will purposely blind themselves.
Im sorry... Did you say only 2 incompletions?
Well lookie at that! Bengals offense looking pretty good the 3rd game in. Are they trying to prove Pre-Season games are necessary? Maybe they need to start showing up to them.
Washington commanders....I sure miss old days....nowadays one just looks for a reason to be offended! As packers fan they will always be the Redskins to me!
Saran Untuk penyelenggara NFL sertakan nama atau susunan pemain di awal video agar kami lebih mengenal para pemain NFL, salam dari 🇮🇩🇺🇲🏈
Booo
As a redskins fan, I am simply thrilled to finally have a QB since RGIII, just hope we keep JD5 fully healthy.
The Bengals were highly tough as super bowl bound...now it doesn't seem like they'll make it to the play off
Chase going to leave Cincinnati next year he just putting on audition tape for his year he already said he's not discussing his contract during the season they had all off season to give this man what's he worth
Ok is it just me or does ekeler look the quickest he's ever been??? Light years quicker than last season for sure
That catch to seal it was ELITE! Great Job 17.  Commanders looked solid. SKOL4LIFE
The Washington O line is Nuts period. That was the difference maker
Daniels did more completions, in one game, than any QB of the last 10 years for the commanders... Finally they have a QB😂😅
As a Bengal, fully deserved by the commanders. We couldnt really stop you, everything you did seemed to come off. The experienced/veteran players on the team put in some work. Play like that most weeks and you are gonna go far
another game another blown call by the ref's
This Washington team is a sleeper, they have vets all over it, and a pretty good young QB so far. Ekler was a really good pick up
As a Steelers fan it’s great to be at the top of the AFC and seeing the rest of our division struggle 😂🖤💛
thank you for winning my fantasy game terry
Bears fans watching Daniel’s ball out: 👀😨🤬🤦
Are the Commanders this season’s Lions or Jets? Daniels is some QB. That final TD toss was highest quality stuff.
Cincinnati put no pressure on Daniels, and he tore them apart.
I feel bad for EL BURRO 😂😂😂😂 MR BURRO no bueno
So they call PI on that when the defender clearly turns his head but never called PI against Chiefs 😂 refs need to be consistent. Also Daniel’s absolutely ballin out.. can’t wait to hear Nick wright try and tell us Caleb is playing better
WOW Cinci is on the bike going downhill 😢😢😢😢😢
Scary terry gotta qb
Man tha rookie balled out. Wishing him nothing but success. I’ll be rooting for ya, and I’m a Steelers fan
I was trying to watch this game but I had to watch the jaguars since I’m in Florida 😢
I’ve seen enough give Daniels ROTY
who is QB #5 wow the guy is cool freezing defense smooth is like he is playing like he is watching the game  with me
Great game, great outcome. Ekeler is a baller and Chase is too good for the 🐯.
Neither of these teams have a defense... this was JV football at best.
What about the no-call pass interference on the 2pt conversion
Man tha rookie balled out. Wishing him nothing but success. I’ll be rooting for ya, and I’m a Steelers fan
Played like a bucket!
Lol I can't wait for the redskins and jayden Daniel's to play philly. And I don't even care where it is. He's gonna get the air let out of his very big head. Kid thinks he's a SUPERSTAR already.  Nope.
Sometimes, it just so happens that stars announce themselves on a national stage ! I feel like that’s what I saw tonight! This feels like the “I’ve Arrived” NFL game for Daniels! Ain’t calling him GOAT, ain’t overhyping what he can be etc…… it just simply looked like he AT LEAST belongs on an NFL FIELD ! Good for him! Wishing him all the best ! Congrats Washington fans… looks like you got your guy!
Vote red instead.
Burrow is hands down the best QB without a win.
Another humiliating season for cowboys fans 😢
We finally have a quarterback I could cry
3rd week in for JD, already throwing 91%! THAT BOI COLD 🌬️❄️🥶
McDaniels is the REAL DEAL WOW
Love me some college offense. Kliff gonna run the wishbone on Zona next week.
Gotta watch DC this yr 😅
2 LSU STUDS💪 GOIN' @IT🏈🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I KNEW JAYDEN WAS THE BEST QB COMING OUT OF THE DRAFT💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
People saying caleb williams is better than jayden daniels are looking pretty stupid rn.
The Redskins are cooking
that daniels to terry throw was awesome , wow
C'mon Washington Fans! It's okay to celebrate! Your Team Won! 🤟🏻💀
Easily the best rook qb this year!!
Ekeler's a pretty darn good #2 RB to have.
Daniels needs to put on some weight or quit running. When  I see him take off like that I see RG III.
Jags and bengals both 0-3 👀
11:45 Why isn't this pass interference? He's not looking at the ball and he's tackling the receiver before the ball gets there. To top it off, the announcers totally ignore the foul even during the replays.
Crazy what happens when you actually throw to Terry McLaurin
Hail to the Redskins!
I hope the Bengal didn't trade their backup Quarter back !
Wow. The Bengals were so bad, they made the Commanders look good.
THEY about to sabotege this kid, something always happen
At the beginning of the season you were told that the steelers and bengals would either be winless or undefeated through 3 games. Which would you have picked? Im guessing not the way the standings are now.
Did Washington have even a single sack? The defensive line gets no pressure on the quarterback, receivers were running wide open across the middle all night and nobody on the defense knows how to deliver a big hit or even wrap up. Offense might win some games but defense wins championships. Washington had better fix the defense, and fast.
Bro Daniels is the truth shout to San Bernardino!
It's great that the racist billionaire Daniel Snyder was forced to get rid of the blatantly racist former name of the Washington NFL franchise. Notice all the comments still whining and moaning about the fact that our U.S. culture has had to put aside some of its racist symbols. For most of us, it's a long-overdue step forward. For the ignorant reactionaries, it's a loss of "our" "culture", an attack on "our way of life", an extremist nightmare of "political correctness".  The old culture was as if a German soccer team would be named the Berlin K*kes, for example, or as if an Alabama NFL team were named the Alabama N-words.
Touchdown Washington Redskins
11:25 did anyone see that RB block?
Washing got a Quarterback? Wow.
Hey @nfl, how is it possible that your referees don't call pass interference when a defender hits a receiver's chest early, and about 24 hours later they call pass interference on a very similar play?!?
I was thinking the Commanders will win 6,7 games. But I didn't know JD would get better every week! Also the OL was above average!😮😅😊
This was the first NFL game to go all 4 quarters without a single punt or turnover since 1940!!!!  Insane
Don't show other game's score. Spoil.
Joe Burrow and Trevor Lawrence getting paid an absolute sack of money to both go 0-3 😭 should’ve known Joe was gonna be a washout when he came back to the league with that hair. Guy needs to focus on his game and spend less time trying to look like an LGBTQ ally
In 3 games Daniels as the same amount of wins as bryce young😂
Bengals fall to 0-3 for first time since 2019!
Bengals "D" is horrendous.......
Will the Washington Commanders do a better Job protecting Daniels than the Washington Redskins did protecting Griffin III....   Daniels has shown great potential tonight, but he has to be protected for the Commanders to succeed as the years go by....
The old commander's would have lost this game 33-31!😮 Even though the defense was terrible.
Pride of San Bernardino baby!!! Show em how it’s done JD5
The start to the nfl season is so drunk
As an lsu fan this game just warmed my heart so much
"Cover 2 is too op"  Mel kiper
Cincy fan here. Very happy for Jayden Daniels, very depressed for my team.
BRING BACK THE LOGO!!!
As a cowboys fan   *big gulp* 😟😳
Lucky game to Daniel's and this commanders team. They won't have a game like this again this season. Every dog has Its day and the Bengals defense has been bad for awhile now. Nothing impressive considering Bengals were 0-2 going into this game.
Joe borrow overrated
NO TURNOVER:: NO PUNTS. !! Long beautiful passes reminds me of the 1970s style football
No turnovers or punts by both teams in a game since 1940!! In-freakin-sain!
Now the Bears wondering why they didn't pick JD and let the Redskins took him...
Jayden Daniels, take a bow young man.
Bring Back the Redskins Mascot!!! ✊
@13:00 The ref lol. "Pass Interference. Defense. No. 1. The b...the foul occurred in the endzone. By rule, the ball is placed at the---ahh whatever, y'all get it---first down." 😆
This is football
When is the last time Washington played this good?.. 1985?
11:33 rare footage of Joe Buck getting excited
WTF bengals!!!!!!
"4th and 4, and you're winning? What, are they insane?"  **gets the first down** "They are geniuses!"
They will always be the Redskins to me!!
Please bring back REDSKINS. bears down 😅😅😅😅cheeehooo ❤
Bengals defense is the worst in the league this is embarassing
that last min PI looked like the one ATL should've got against Chiefs
I see a mix of lj and k1 in jayden
Wow look at the refs actually calling defensive pass interference in the end zone...
That deep TD pass by Daniels in the face of an all out blitz was spectacular
On that Daniel's rush TD he coulda did that on the play that went to Brian for the TD I knew they were gonna come back to that
Redskins win.
Life long Commanders and LSU fan.. Jeaux Burreaux and Chase had a great game but I’m more proud of JD5 and the Commanders for pulling out the win!..♥️💛💜💛
Bengals defence is joke.
Joe Burrow settled for FGs in the first half and got out done by a dual threat sensation. Pocket passer will not cut it anymore.
Great play calling DQ
Hernandez Sharon Davis Ronald Harris Jose
GO, REDSKINS !!!
Can we please get rid of the "Commanders" name already? Same with the Cleveland "Guardians". What happened to creative sports team names?
Bengals season is OVER 😹😹
You know Washington got them a good QB when Ja'Marr Chase was trying to get Jayden's number at the end of the game. (Listen to the last few seconds). Pretty soon every receivers gonna want to play with him. 😂 Jayden's that DAWG!! 👊
As a Wash fan, we haven’t seen this Offense high powered since a decade ago 😢
Good game
I am so sorry to say it, but the duo Burrow-Chase deserves better team. It hurts.
Washington offensive line did fantastic tonight. Gave the rookie a real shot to get the ball to the receivers.
The way thay drive went you'd think washington was in for a long night...football funny sometimes
very impressive QB plays!  First since RG3?
Jayden Daniels had a flashback to his playing days at LSU. Young man played lights out.
The QB play in this game can't get much better than this, congratulations to the Commanders on their new franchise QB. Best QB in the draft.
Home team looking good!!! Skins4life
Bro out there looking like Randle Cunningham
i knew washingtons defense was horrible but so were the Bengal's.
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! 🏈🔥
Best nfl game this season
Who'd thought the Bengals would start the season 0-3?
I’m an eagles fan but a football fan first JD is for real my eagles better be ready this season and seasons to come 😳
Time to hit the panic button, 0-3 is just not something you want especially in that division
L
Those throws by Burrows is amazing to see
Bengals lookin like the Bengals of old.
They gone beat the S... Out the cowboys 😂😂
Hail! Let’s go, Cs. ☝🏻
Way to go Redskins!!
Uh oh my hopes are getting up for DC
11:25 beyond impressive to stare down a blitz and deliver a straight dot.
Commanders defensive coordinator needs to be dropped asap.
Jaden daniels is him better than Caleb
JD5 IS HIM!!!
I know how the Texans felt last year feels good to find a QB after so long 🥹
Bengals complained about the Reg last week. What about this week???
Washington Commanders doesn't ring a bell.
Are Commies good or it’s just Cinci’s bad defence?
ah yes, the commanders commanders vs the cincinnati bengals.
Wow great blocking too.
Wait isn’t a missed fg considered a turnover
Brothaaaaaa
Tylil dance to hawwd😂😂
Slow start huh?
Ever sìnce 'Burrowhead':  -Burrow knocked out for 2023 season -Bengals finish last in the AFC North -Chase Hold-In -0-3 start
I AM SOO PROUD of them they did they thang on that field😂
Dang if the bengals didn’t miss that one field goal they could of gone for the 2 in the end to tie the game for OT
Jayden Daniel’s is everything people thought Caleb Williams would be and then some. What a stud!
says alot on Chases 2 touchdown only another receiver would celebrate with him. Also saw him not block for Higgins
This game was evenly matched for the most part .  No defense allowed. Washington really has found themselves a good young rookie  quarterback and a heck of a running back.
First game in 2 years the stars aligned and I was able to watch the game with my dad like old times, and what a game it was! I told him 3 plays before the Mclaurin TD “I could see us hitting Terry on a a one and one for a touchdown” he disagreed saying we were just gonna focus on running out the clock, then 10 minutes later Daniels hits him on a bomb and we hi fived  knowing Terry makes those contested plays! Great memory and an even greater game!
Daniel’s is legit played amazing
idk if i should say commanders have a future qb or say where was the defenses? did they stay home? seems like both offenses was doing as they wanted!
did anyone catch that block by the RB at 11:27? Good lord
Cowboys native. Not a fan rn. Would never root for a rival in the division but they look good
Burrow is not elite
Eagles fan here idk I think Washington is going to be our biggest threat
If cincy can’t beat Washington at home with both of their WRs… it’s gonna be a long season
Great job Nick Allegretti!! WE will always LOVE and appreciate you ❤️💛❤️💛
Good game guys I am not a fan of these team's great for football  taken  my nap  and watching this game  at 1:15 am
Oh boy 0-3 for the bengals is a nice thing to see.
BENGALS FAN THAT BOY DANIELS HELLA NICE 🔥😤 MAD RESPECT
0-3 Bengals  Unexpected
Washington went from one of the Best uniforms and helmets to the worst in the NFL
Crazy bengals got that dpi but falcons didn’t get it Monday should tell u there chiefs don’t get flags ever
JD at this point is showing that he should've been the overall #1 pick in the draft, not Caleb Williaiams
We finally got our guy! Let's go!
DC will burn down if Washington wins the Super Bowl!
Our run game hasn’t been this good since Clinton Portis
LSU alumnus this was a hella of a game
Bears fans: this could have been your QB😂
NFL.... How long are you going to subject to the audio and mental torture of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman calling games? 65 year Mexican and Iberian commentators make a boring sport like futbol or soccer sound like Ali x Frasier ever single match but somehow we're stuck with monotone Joe and Troy who are about as exciting as drying paint. Please please change this.
Redskins played well.
It's a rough week as a Bengals fan man. I just want use to win
GOOD WORK COMMANDERS!!!!
LSU BABY
the NFL is in a great place ,,,these young QB's are Ballin Ballin
Bengals fan here, and I swear we're not as bad as we look lol. Great game 'Skins, you earned it. You are a powerhouse in the making.
Looks like he should’ve been the number 1 pick
9/8 Bengals - We're the team to beat.  9/30 Bengals - We're looking for a team to beat.
Nice college offense
Daniels got an arm on him
when they start ww3 we offer zac taylor as tribute… whole city hates that mf…
I just want to give a huge shout out to all the Washington fans out there from Chiefs Kingdom. Looks like you might have found your franchise QB! Daniels has been looking awesome!
Last Year 1st Pick Bryce Young (Bust?) 2nd Pick CJ Stroud (Franchise QB)  This Year 1st Pick Caleb Williams (Bust?) 2nd Pick Jayden Daniels (Franchise QB?)
How was that his first career passing TD when he’s thrown like 5 lol
Weird I dont see Bengals fans on this throwing a fit about "We only lost this because the refs and their terrible calls"
Commanders instead of Redskins and Joe Buck calling the game.  Makes you wanna drink some plain water and eat rice cakes.
Washington's defense has a lot of work to do
The pass interference by Washington in the end zone looked EXACTLY like the one the Chiefs did on Atlanta- arms around the body, back to the ball.
Commanders fan, WHAT A GAME!!! GG’s Cincy.
Let's go commanders! I hope austin ekeler is good tho
Good to see that both former Falcons Head Coaches are having much success with Young, Mobile Quarterback play.....
Write all the games like this please.
finally!
11:54 if he didnt catch this people would be yelling "PASS INTERFERENCE, HES CLEARLY THERE BEFORE THE BALL" Its football.....just stop
2 LSU QB's... I'm proud and happy for them!
That's a wrap for Cincy.
Very happy to see my boys finally play a solid offensive game. Defense still needs more work tho. JD is the first rookie in QB history with a 91% completion rating, this is the first game since 1940 to go with no punts or turnovers, and the LSU fans got to see 2 of their former Heisman winners go head to head. Definitely one for the books 💪🏽
Cam taylor-Britt needs to shut the hell up and stop putting bulletin board comments out there. Cause Daniels absolute dotted them up. Burnt him for the 56 yard bomb too after he said he doesn’t throw deep ☠️
11:25 this a crazy block for a back 🤯🤯
Redskins offense was on fire all night!
Bengals let them win
Burrow and the Bengals are an embarrassment. 0 and 3 on their way to 0 and 4.
Iosivas' unnecessary little leap for that td grab cracked me up
If we (Washington) develop any semblance of a pass rush, we'll be dangerous this season.
The first game in 84 years without a punt or turnover. Wow.
Cincinnati defense is  a joke. The atack too
Steelers gonna win the super bowl
So basically teams should start tanking for the second pick and not the first
Two years in a row, the second draft pick QB looks like the best QB.
Chase should come to MN.
They gotta consider a coaching change
Ok, so the MVP question today is: Darnold or Daniels.... crazy😂
Trent Scott : Game Ball : Dance Practice Tuesdays 11-1pm K Street Studio😊
7:26 not even an attempt to block his man, smh chase
Haha 0-3
Redskins played great football tonight!
Bengal's defense is shocking
LSU qbs balling strong in this one!
Bengals=🤕
Beat by a "college offense." Hmm... Imagine that😂
Its LSU greatness all over that field.. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow, LSU Quarterback,  Cincinnati Wide Receiver JaMarr Chase, and Washington Commanders Quarterback Jaden Daniels.. i dont really like LSU but shout out to them for producing NFL superstars
Washington is the team to beat in the NFC East!
I know Jack Kent Cooke is like….FINALLYYYYY!!
2:18 False start
What stadium were they playing in? I couldn’t tell who the crowd was for? It was equal cheering for both sides
Screw the bengals
The Redskins played great 👍
Bengals have no defense
59 trying to knock that man block off 😂😂😂😂😂
Jaysus the redeemer!!! And on the third game he rose
As a Washington fan I hope Cincinnati fans keep their heads up. Y’alls offense is special, definitely don’t deserve to be 0-3. Plenty of time to bounce back especially with Baltimore sitting at 1-2. #HTTC
Lot of missed field goals this year
This season is shaping up to be the year of tears. So many teams that were anticipated to storm out of the gates are tanking. Glad I'm not into gambling, pretty much every team I want to win loses and every team I want to lose wins. But as we know injuries happen so things can turn around on a dime.
Daniels was playing ELITE ball tonight. Props to the Commanders, nice to see them doing well.
That last pass interference is similar to the chief and falcon pass interference
Jayden Daniels showed out tonight showing Bengals and fans that he's dangerous and he did all touchdowns no punts and no turnovers BELIEVE IN JD5   P.S. Cam Taylor-Britt, HOW BOUT THAT COLLEGE OFFENSE?! 😂😂😂😂😂
Redskins have found their Franchise Quarterback for the present and future
Bruh how do my cardinals have a better record than the bengals
Austin eckler is so underrated man 🔥💯
That catch by TMac😮
Daniels is playing like Chris Smoove tonight!
Wow the Redskins came to play!
Saw this game with some of my buddies @ our team bar. What a performance by Jayden with only TWO incompletions. Completing 21 total with 2 TD’s passing and another rushing TD. Of course, got Terry involved like he and Kliff Kingsbury said they would. Of course, in the end, Terry does what he does. The defense bent, but didn’t break. So, SO happy we got the win.
Terry is as good as chase n jefferson
Do Bengals players ever block for each other?
I see 2 more losses for Dallas !
Where are the noisy Bengals fans? I guess they was robbed again😂😂😂😂😂
Are the Chiefs or Kelce or refs responsible for this loss, too?  This is the type of game & team should be discussed.
Dallas cowboys watch out
Shout out to the editor for keeping in the big mans celebration, such a cool moment to see , especially against a rival team😂  #herewego
Dude that pass Jayden threw to McLaurin at 4:42 was nuts
Can’t believe I bet on the bengals
Surprise, daniels is the best rookie qb...oh wait, its not a surprise
Bengals don't go 0-4 to the Panthers
I think the Redskins found a QB finally.
The only thing Washington needs to do is bring back their name!
Jayden Daniels is a promising quarterback, he can win some beautiful games for Commanders, like this one. I’m too happy for him and the Commanders.
Remember when chase said they were the team to beat..... wa happen 🤷‍♂️
Trent Scott scoring was priceless
I hates these thumbnails that give away what team won
Congrats Washington for the W and (even more importantly) finally finding a great young QB!  But man, Cincy looks done already. That defense is a laughing stock.
I been saying it since before the season started, Redskins going to the playoffs and the Cowboys gona miss the playoffs this year. Bet it
Thanks NFL for putting the winner in the thumbnail!
Looks good for Daniels, now let's see if he can keep it up
wow I'm a niner fan,,,what a good game these 2 teams gave
So nobody told me Ekeler was new  “Beast Mode”. Like wtf. Bro runs like he’s light as a feather but is wide as a bus. 💀
This is the best game of the week without any doubt, the scores were so close. Both teams had so many touchdowns, but Bengals had much better receptions and also one more receiving touchdown. Joe Burrow had 3 touchdown passes.
Y’all better chill with ROY on JD. It too early, I haven’t seen him play against a good defense. Wait til the game film rolls out.
a good win for The RedSkins
As a Redskins fan we have not had a great QB since Sonny Jurgenson. I am hoping that JD5 will be a great QB for a long time in DC.
Can’t blame number 1 he saw the chiefs do it last night 😂😭
BOTH defenses were stinky. WASHINGTON made more plays, and came out on top. If they can concentrate against Cardinals next weekend,  they can get to 3-1.
I hear people saying ROY for Jayden Daniels but I’m saying MVP!
that was the conclusion to this weekend of upsets!
If Jayden Daniels plays like this all year, someone will be hiring Kliff Kingsbury as their HC next season.
I’m just here for all the draft experts who told me how superior Williams was to Daniels.
What the heck is Mark Rypien playing, am I in 1991 lol!
Man, yall got to stop with these spoiler thumbnails
4:40 The way Jayden can uncork these MASSIVE bombs and drop it on a dime while keeping his form so tight is seriously underated. He had a clean pocket here but being able to launch these from a collapsing pocket is so rare. This game showcases his talents really well
Redskins looked good
Couldn’t ask for a better drive on the Terry TD. Ate so much clock and sealed the W.
Wow, that was crazy! What a shootout; shout out Commanders 🏈 🏈 🏈
Bengals will still be top 10 in power rankings
Daniels definitely should have been the number one draft pick
Yall must not have known about JD. Dude was a beast in college
As a 30+ yearlong redskin/commanders fan, I feel cautiously optimistic about our future.
Caleb Williams who?
Burrow will be flipping hamburgers in a few years.
Jayden Daniel’s the real deal
Skins are looking good
MNF Washington Commanders
A penalty on “Defense, #1.” You never would’ve heard that in an NFL game before 2020.
Too great defenses!!
We have no secondary and Bengals still lost lmao😂
Good Game
Burrow,  could be like Marino, super bowl appearance rookie year, never come back, i used to respect Burrow, but he went woke, so I hope you lose every game
Did the bears mess this up again
Burrow: 50 millions for 0-3 😂😂
Let’s go redskins
Daniels is to Caleb Williams what Stroud was to Bryce Young.  The Bears detonated their franchise by going for the chalk pick and choosing the wrong guy.  Meanwhile the Redskins for the first time in decades have a true franchise QB.  Well played, Washington.
Jayden Daniel’s is a dawg he’s got a bright future in the NFL
How do you expect to win when you give up 38
Let Jayden Daniels cook watch his high school and college highlights once he gets his rhythm hes stuff in it
Heck of a come back
13:49 That's an insane stat. Punters got the night off.
LSU’s greatest QB and Jayden Daniels
Don't say they going to win
Daniels clearly looks like the best rookie QB so far this year. Kid is going to be great if he continues on this path.
Zac Taylor is Satan.
Bears should have hired cliff as soon as we knew we’d draft Caleb. Just stupid 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Redskins
Chase missed the flea flicker at 7:30 😢
bengals fell off
Just like the last season Bengals started their season 0-3, I hope they clinch a playoff spot this season.
They kick but 😊
We need a Young quarterback like that a person that don't turn over the ball 🤔 great game young man
Bengals seem like they have the saints old o/c rarely choosing to pass down the field.
New kick returns are awful 😂
PLEASE stay healthy, Jayden D......
Bengals 0-3 lol 😅
Being a Washington Fan since i was a baby, i am so proud to say that we are soooo back ❤❤ Go Commanders💛🤎🖤 Hail To The Commanders and Redskins!!❤❤❤❤
OOPS, BUNGHOLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WTF happened to the Bengals. They are 0-3 now😂😂😂😂
haven't seen my hometown team play this good since RGIII
WE GOT THE JOB DONE 💯💯💯💯 positive rebuild 🙏🏿💪🏿💯
I miss the Redskins.
LSU played well in this game.
Did the refs help the commanders? Cincinnati fans?
Great win, something to build on. Defense still needs work. Actually watched the whole game with excitement.
Bengals just embarrassing team 😂💀
anyone dumb enough to ever have defended frat boy Gal coach it's time to realize he is a total loser.   This franchise is a disgrace.  The Browns need to sell it to someone who has a clue.
Daniels is a stud, and as a Commanders fan, I predict he gets hurt either next week or the game after that.
Scary Terry
Bengals and Jaguars 0-3 yikes 😬😬
So the redskins are good now?
Lets go man #HTTR
I've been a Redskin/Commander fan since 1966. Jayden Daniels, for a rookie, played a perfect football game. If Washington had a defense, they would be a playoff team. Also, Ekeler is a running back!
Bengals, if you can't defend you can't win. Washington scored a TD on every drive except one. Fire the Head Coach and the Defensive Coordinator or just be satisfied with being pathetic. I believe they will just remain pathetic. Go watch some more film like that will do you dummies any good. You just don't have the athletes or brains.
King of King Queen 👑 👸 see over view of game my love 💓
Wow what a performance by Daniel
Jayden Daniels is what us Carolina Panthers fans wanted Bryce Young to be.
I don’t like the commanders but if Jayden can develop as a passer early in his career he’ll be a 100 times better than Lamar Jackson
Way to go Redskins
Does *anyone* look 'Good' in Week 3? I feel like truncated training camp & pre-season are really hurting team cohesiveness.
Is it just me or has Joe Buck vastly improved as a commentator the past couple of years
😳so Washington is no longer a punching bag? 😳
Austin Ekeler has so much Aura
Congrats, Commanders! The Bengals needed to lose so we can finally fire Zac Taylor
It sure looked like dude did not get both feet down on that last TD by Washington.
After almost of decade of misery, we have finally found our guy in JD5
Hail to The *Redskins.!* Now... if they could only learn to play defense... & please, go back to the Old Uniform. They look like they raided some Dicks' Sporting Goods.
RG3 was the best thing since myspace, then he wasn’t. Jayden is even my fantasy qb, so don’t get me wrong, I really like the kid.. but calm tf down for a season or two yeah 🤨
Eagles fan here. It is not inplausible to believe that McDaniels will be the best qb in his draft. HE whips it, seems to have great vision, made huge plays down teh strtch and work the pocket terrifically. He will have young qb hiccups, but look at Hurts and his draft class? A lot of great qb's but any given year he may the best of them. There was 4 qb's int eh frist 10 icks in his year, there was 4 in the 1st round in Hurts 2020 years. And all of the 2024 qb draft class were worthy of there spot. He put together a good 4 quarters of tape here. Eagles vs. Redskins twice a year, that'll be good. Worthy qb opponets for potentially years to come.
Anyone else find this guy utterly insufferable? They say his first words were, "mama, pass is caught". I either watch his games with the volume turned off, or don't watch them at all 🤮🤮🤮
Need to play better! We allowed Cincinatti to have a major comeback. Pick up the defense Washington!
Funny my son's name is chase brown lol
Bengals, best 0-3 team. Needs to D up!!!
wait the commanders are good now?
Bengals start the season 0-3. Who saw that coming? Crazy season and it’s only just begun.
Burrows to Chase for a TD Jayden Daniel: hold my 55 yard bomb, and i'll just skip into the endzone 😂 LSU vs LSU
JD the man! *cries in Raider😔🏴‍☠️
Commanders got no defense.  That's a problem for them,  they got to get that straight if they going to win games more because you can't always rely on offensive.
what is even happening in the nfl rn
scaryTerry
Change the name back to redskins !!
There was so many things I saw the Redskins do tonight that I havent seen in so long. Is there actually hope?
I’ve been saying this all along… just give JD some time to adapt to the speed of the NFL, and then he will be one of the top quarterbacks in this league!
Daniels 💪💪💪
Jayden Daniels 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
What happened to the bengals hyped defense😂
Dan Quin that dude Cowboys look like 💩 now that he gone
- After just 1 game, Jayden Daniels is already a better quarterback than Dak Prescott.
Commanders playing some high level football there fellas
It seems anyone can play QB in the NFL these days. Crazy how much they watered it down.
Jayden Daniels is him and i love how he gave praise to God this young man deserves nothing but good things well done mom and dad.
Washington in a convincing win  on a Monday Night.  Truly a very rare thing indeed.
It's there ego trip that blinds them
REDSKINS!!!
All my rowdy friens r here fo mon nite😊❤
But that Falcons pass interference was not called against the Cheifs. A joke
This would’ve never happened under the Rule of Dan Snyder. Looks like we can finally compete. Still early I know.
Cincy 0-3?  Is this real?
So happy terry got a qb 😢
No it's not everyone has a special talent people don't recognize until it's to late
Wash Oline really stepped up and Cosmi again showing why he he got paid
Great performance from both quarterbacks
Bengals 0-3 ... didn't think it would start like this.  Playoffs are going to be a difficult thing to achieve now.
Jayden Daniel’s is THAT GUY, he’s BEEN that guy, ROY easily , ring in the first 5 years🙏🤝🤞trust , also great game for two LSU qb’s
Redskins win baby!!! FY!
Daniel’s is everything we were expecting Caleb Williams to be lmfao
Knew it was only a matter of time before Daniels and McClaurin connected. Love to see JD5 grow I got his jersey before the season even started 😅
I slept on the Commanders... showed tonight they're a force to treat carefully on
Both defenses look like they will be bottom dwellers in the NFL.  Weak pass rushes.  Not enough to get either team far in the playoffs, although Commanders may have a somewhat successful season on the back of Jayden Daniels.
Naahhhhh Washington looking difffferent
I'm glad the Redskins won the game!
How did commanders pull this off
Commanders you guys got your franchise qb
That VR training aint no joke!
Love to see it blessings
That was a bomb! 4:43
When Moss reversed his field it was reminiscent of the things James Brooks would do to a team in the 80’s. Both he & Brown are quick & elusive. Defense really stank to high heaven
Thank you Commanders, from a Steelers fan
As bengals fan im surprised there was no turn over both teams played well but i will bot count us out yet this game felt special
Bengals, you are a huge embarrassment.
Two Heisman Trophy winning QBs from the same Alma Mater (LSU) square off. Has that ever happened before?
Good Job WHODEAY.. amazing way to start off the year lmaooo ,its a race between the ravens and Bengal's to see who can get back on track and im taking the Ravens.. once we get to the back end of the season and the north starts playing each other every week/ every other that will shape the division
It’s wild that Burrow was only the 3rd best QB tonight out of 4 with a passer rating of nearly 130, 3TD, no picks, and over 300 yards passing.
Wow great game.  Commanders WIN!!
jayden daniels is the truth.
The Redskins are looking good.
This was an all LSU battle 😂
What about that’s bills score in the corner 😊
A certain segment hates seeing our guys excell. Explains why they tried to hold us back from yhe position ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Good game, with two good QBs duking it out. . . . it could have gone either way.
Looks like he should of went #1 😂 Bears QB😂😂 Mel always get it wrong for now anyway🙏
Lowkey Austin Ekeler got some Speed 🏉
Am I the ONLY Bengals fan bitching about this group of fairies lack of tackling in all three games? That's why we lost tonight. Not taking anything away from the Commanders, but if the Bengals handle the tackling, we win.
11:15  HUGE play. I'm glad it paid off!
Party in Washington D.C.
All these high paying QB 's.
Preceding NFL game brought to you by the Bengal Tigers of LSU.
Commanders oline did a really good job. Felt like Daniel's had plenty of time to throw. Though props to him as well for throwing through tight windows.
Daniel's reminds me of when RG3 first started his first few games only thing I can tell Jayden is that he needs too slide more and not take big hits other than that he looks good so far.
Im not surprised with jayden daniel performance he did this at lsu he def a successful talent in Washington
Bungles gonna Bungle.
Easily the best duel of QB’s I’ve seen this season. It’s been 84 years since a game like this happened, no turnovers and punts!
Although Cincinnati did good offensively I’m just gonna say it. They are really missing both Mixon and Boyd.
Bengals will finish the season with a winning record mark my words. Theirs still 15 or 16 games in the seaosn I think 😅😂😂. I lost count cause every year they add a game cause the NFL apparently doesnt have enough money.
Was there . Was the best rookie performance I’ve literally ever seen live
Bengals always make great QB in their history starting from Brett Favre .. to Lamar .. they just are great luck for new QB. I knew they will be defeated. Daniel will be going back to Daniel first two games.
YOSHI! THE WOM LEGEND
Jayden Daniel’s is HIM! He is the real deal. He makes it look easy. He embarrassed the Bengals. Those announcers were stunned. So stunned they didn’t want to give him credit for an amazing game.
As a cowboys fan, I really look forward to the Redskins running the NFC East this year!
Ya’ll in here putting all the broadcast gems as comments LMAO.
El corredor de comanders es muy bueno
bengals are cooked
Bengals starting to fade like Dallas..😢
Bengals D is terrible man
so happy to see Ekeler with positive contributions
The kid looked great , not just lucky, and didn't get happy feet like so many rookies do. You never know, we Chiefs fans knew rookie 15 was good, but few were prepared for the Mercuric rise that followed. Now, Redskins fans get to hear Bengals' nation cry about the officiating all week.
Its too bad Jayden Daniels is going to end up going the way of Robert Griffin III....He is a talented dude but he isn't built like Cam Newton...His willingness to just run is going to get him hurt....he doesn't have the frame to take that punishment on this level....I hope he stays healthy because he is fun to watch...this game is a prime example...hopefully with success, he doesn't get an ego and take plays into his own hands to often
Who DEY.......change it to everybody.
...ha, HA! You lost! At home. Cameraman should show more fans faces during the game! 🎉 0 - 3 🎉
Everyone JD5 steps onto the field:  *That's my quarterback* 🥲
6:47 I loved seeing the Commanders' O-line celebrating Scott's tuddy with him.
and to think, my team took Williams over this Dude.
As a Washington fan I almost cried, absolutely beautiful
Unbelievable 0-3 start by the Bengals. 🤦‍♂
Bengals are straight cheeks
College offense says the corner getting cooked and burnt to 0-3 😂.
if kicker kicks the ball in the air instead of on the ground can the kicking team move? i thought ball had to hit the ground first on an on side kick attempt  amateurish special teams play when if you dont recover the game basically ends? that dont look good for bengals chances of a winning division or decent season when you have five guys bungle a special teams play
W
Jayden cool,calm,and poised 21-23 257yds 2 TD's set record for completion percentage 91.3% He's a rookie folks!!! So proud of our QB and team tonight. Great game!!!🏈🏈🏈
2 LSU Heisman winning QBs
I knew Daniel's was the best QB in the draft. Can't believe people thought dude in Chicago was better.😅
Wow! Jayden Daniels rlly went 21/23 252yrd 3tot TDs. What a performance. And also thats the highest completion % by a rookie in a single game.
New thumbnails are 🔥🔥🔥
Crazy how Jayden Daniel’s come from SAN BERNARDINO CA. Nd CJ stroud outta Rancho Cucamonga? And trading the league up !💯💯
burrow putting up mvp numbers just for his defense to sell him
We are so worried about Kansas City and not focused on other teams and getting bbq smoked at home by teams we have no business losing to. Smh
Commander fans, remember how happy you guys were after RG3 debut? Clam down a tad 😮‍💨🤫,
So happy for Kliff ❤
Finally got one in JD5🔥
Patriots should have lost more games then we’d have gotten Jayden.
And not a single down of defense was played the whole night.  I spent months hoping the Pats would trade up to get Daniels, but I'm happy he's not in line to get shredded behind our matador offensive line. It looked easy for him in college, it looks easy for him now. Bright future.
Man it was exciting watching two former LSU QBs go at it!
Great game Commanders.. Congratulations Jaden and my favorite receiver Terry for finally connecting.   Things are looking brighter for the Commanders.
Coms D looks really good..
Orland Extension
I know it’s early but Jayden Daniels is the real deal!
Funny i remember betting that Jayden Daniels at the end of the year would have a much better season then Williams even though williams supposedly went to the best situation any number one overall pick QB has gone too.. so far Daniels def looks far better then Williams
91% completion percentage (rookie record)
Chase bringing bad karma to Cincy
Washington Redskins are tie for first in NFC East, I would've called you crazy if you told me this 3 weeks ago
The offensive line has Clearly improved this year here in Washington as well. Watching the highlights and seeing Real improvements
Media still going say bengals have a chance just cause what they did in 2020😂😭
Thank you jayden than you redskins /Commanders thank you coach for a game worth watching ,we old diehards with our hearts tied to the burgundy and gold waited OH so long for this night it felt like won the freaking superbowl ,thank you God bless you made an old fan happy.
Joe burrow played lights out. Get this man a defense
Jayden has the composure of someone that's already been in the league for years.  Geaux Tigers
Only 2 incompletions by Daniel’s is crazy.
When Chiefs DB was hogging Kyle Pitts, it wasn’t even no PI. NFL love the Chiefs bailed them out every games. Every other teams DBs 100% of the times, it’s PI
Hell of a game ! Two LSU stud QB's, ballin' out ... 💪
Jayden was picked second overall....  which makes him the STEAL of this draft class.  The man has it.
Burrow is overrated AF
There’s finally a QB in DC. 💯
its funny to watch Skins fans think this was about your QB.  it was not. its was about youre Oline.  learn foobtall
Our defense lost us this game
Did the Bungles not get the memo that the season started?
Great game ✊ both QBs played great. Jayden Daniels broke a record also! Httr
Glad Bengals lost after that girly scream from Chase. Prolly dresses as a woman in the off hours
MY COMMANDERS ARE LIKE THAT
Bengals defense reminded me of the college defenses JD smoked with LSU  Taylor Britt keep 🤫
6:26 Hendrickson got bullied 😭
Man burrow is washed... One thing to lose to a bad team randomly on any given Sunday. It's another thing to lose to that same bad team one year in desperation mode trying to avoid an 0-3 start
Bungals choke, I´m fine with that. Since Burrow looks like a bad copy of Eminem, they loose.
The Bengals defense was bad tonight
my first ever nfl game
Great Game  Team😊😊😊
0-17 Bengals first round pick
As a Washington fan, I'm speechless 😮
Burrow and derrick henry and amari cooper carrying my fantasy this week
the commanders are better in road games, good start let's see what's gonna happen, young team they need more games to get some experience I hope this season will be less injuries, that's enemy number 1 of wash ,good luck Daniels
SOOoooo Happy Bengals Lost. Wash look good
What Jayden Daniels did tonight is unreal and almost unheard of for a rookie quarterback and as for the bengals they have lots of questions over the next week and they may even lose to the panthers.
Jayden Daniels’ face looks like a beautiful woman wearing a fake beard
Another NFL disaster with their rigged nonsense  when commentators tell you before the game , and during the game what will happen and it does YOU KNOW it is all scripted and when one team is allowed penalties unseen and the other everything is seen that also speaks volumes SO FAR in every NFL game this season we see the exact same thing happening And what happened to the Bengals in this game will happen to the Commanders in another wait and see. Same with the Bills, Jacksonville game another scripted nonsense  the KC thieves, Throw the game Falcon's  was so obvious it was laughable and on and on every game goes
Ok, Jayden Daniel's and Commanders looking good. Good win.👀🗣
I typed redskins vs and this popped up 😂
Not sure if the Redskins are actually good or if the Bengals over hype is finally coming to light.
washington to the super bowl
Star in the making #JD5
Here i was watching the bills game instead thinking this one wouldn't be any good...good thing i dont make bets cause im wrong alot
Aye yay yay! 0 TO and  0 punts either team & my Washington Commanders win! They have been ATROCIOUS on prime-time games. I was very nervous watching this game & Cincy scoring easily on 1st drive was like uh oh…here we go again. Defense broke & bent but offense scoring TDs solves everything. Last week's 7 scoring possessions was awesome & coach Quinn addressed that. GREAT JOB COMMANDERS  👍🏽 👌🏽 🙌🏽
You gotta give that game ball to the big man. That might be his only one. That's the first of many for Daniels!
Great job jayden by far the worst defense ever old bobby wagner is our best defense player who looks like he needs to retire please get this defense together a rookie cannot carry the team.
In only the third minute of this highlight reel the bills were already beating the jaguars 34 to 3. 😂
Both of these qbs played amazing, but Jayden Daniels really just proved that he's the best rookie qb there is. He could be one of the best in the next few years. Anyways GO HAWKS 💚💙
Enough of the childlike end zone celebration...
Interesting that PI was called in the end zone but in the chiefs vs falcons game it was ignored.
Zac Taylor gotta go.  Wasting Burrow's prime with this inept coach.  #BringInBelichick
Should have blurred the scoring of the other game…
HAIL TO THE REDSKINS
My ❤️ was with Daniel's.Our defense stinks
If you took the best defensive players from both teams, you'd still have a shitty defense.
reminds me of how we all felt during RG3's rookie year. Let's hope they keep him safe, and get a bit of luck. All that running is risky.
Jayden Daniel is very very good
Daniels & the Commies was a BEAST tonight with that performance… the Commanders’ future is looking bright!  As for Burrow & the Bungles… they’ve hit the dreaded 0-3…  Yeah, they’re making the Super Bowl this season.
Lou Anarumo needs to be fired 😂
Dallas is in Trouble.
Jayden Daniels runs fast, but he does not rely on his speed.  He is polished like veteran QBs.
For the first time in my life as a 31 year old commander fan I am actually confident in our future quarterback play
Daniel’s for ROTY & that mccaffrey connection going to be good for the future
Burrow played well but the bengals defense was awful. Give it up to Jayden  he’s clearly the best rookie qb so far this season
That last touchdown by Daniels was a pretty throw
Jaden woke up tonight, future looks good for Washington at this pace. Good game on both ends
So the commander's get called for interference in the end zone, and the chiefs did the same, but no interference called, and they won the game. Tell me the refs aren't helping the chiefs win games.
The bears did it again . Had the first pick , and just like in 2017 , picked the wrong quarterback . Jalen may be a rookie but he has 5 years experience of being a quarterback and won the 2023 Heisman . He has good pocket presence and a strong arm .
Everyone had either the Bengals or the Ravens winning the AFC North. NOT HAPPENING! My Steelers are rolling, baby! #HEREWEGO
Talk about torn between two loves. I'm a LSU faithful.🤔
Scarence Terrence making us PROUD.
Not sure if the Redskins offense is that good or the Bungles defense is that bad.  Either way, Cincy is in trouble.
The refs helped the commanders 😂😂😂😂😂
What really scary is JD5 is still learning 👀 every game he learns more and more. Boy oh boy it’s good to be a Washington fan!!!
Commanders did good tonight. Even though they are in a rebuild stage. Need a couple of players on the offensive side. And several on the defensive side. At least they solved the QB problem they have had for over 30 years. They just need a few more pieces, and they will be contenders every year.
As an LSU fan this was a treat to watch
Didn't watch the game (for obvious reasons), but really happy for Jayden Daniels and his revitalized team! Maybe the Commanders can take the division this season!
I appreciate the spoiler free thumbnails
Bengals need to fire all their coaches and most of the defensive players
ROOKIE OF THE YEAR! Jayden Daniels is crushing it and he's only going to get better. Great win by the Commanders!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That dive-bomb TD to Scary Terry in a clutch moment to seal the game was magnificent!👏🏾
lmao, imagine taking caleb williams instead of jayden daniels plus two extra 1sts plus other picks/players.  only a franchise as bad as the bears could make such a terrible decision.  would be even funnier if fields ends up being a good QB too, and williams is a bust.  would be the most bears thing ever
HTTR
I said before the start Daniel's is like a Lamar Jackson.
shoutout to the bears. thanks for jayden
Great Game! Daniels Performed Excellent!! Terry  McLoren is an INCREDIBLE receiver!!
HTTR
Funny how the chiefs can demoralize teams!!
Daniels is going to be special man
Daniel’s is lucky to have Kingsbury! He could’ve been drafted by the bears 😂
Daniels lead the Young Commando to 2-1,seeing off the Bengals whom are 0-3,of Wk3,game highlights....😊
Cincinnati definitely has the talent and they are healthy. Maybe the league has just figured them out. 0-3 in the AFC will be hard to come back from.
Bengals-we the team to beat! Bengals- we also 0-3!
This offense with the defense from two years ago 💪🏽
Bengals r cooked
Next year, cornerback, edge and we will win 9 or 10 games. Maybe more with another o-line guy.
Jayden is in chocolate city too the DC hoes finna be hounding him 😂
If I had owned the Washington "Red Skins" and that whole fake indignation came at me about Native American cultural Appropriation Bla Bla Bla. I would have changed the team logo to a Potato and kept the name Washington "Red Skins"  That would have been my double barreled middle finger to the Woke Crowd and then year after year I would change the Logo a little bit at a time until it was a Potato that looked remarkably like the old Logo. .... That's just me. Unlike the Woke Ice Holes that made them change, ... I'm a Football Fan.
The bengals need to scrap there offensive line and there entire defensive staff/players.  How burrow deserves better.  On that note though MAN JAYDEN DANIEL’S IS going to be a star. I hope he just continues to take care of himself along with that offensive line who held it down for him.
Daniel’s has all the time in the world with that oline.
The best QB in his draft class
Zack Taylor has to go always runs on first down in red zone for no gain ,Then D knows pass next to and then we kick a fg ,And the defense is a joke ,Red Rocket will pass for anther 300 yds
This was a fun game to watch, up and down the field, and the #5 Daniels is the best rookie QB I've seen thus far.
It's amusing watching these highlights and seeing the score from the other game in real time. 34-3 at the half? 😮
as a young fan of commanders we finally back bro LETS GO
Dan quiin and the redskins will be a problem for the cowboys in and of itself
COMMANDERS WILL HAVE DALLAS FOR BREAKFAST THIS YEAR
Now where the  "we should of drafted Maye or Bo Nix" talk tonight? 🤔  😆😆😆  GIVE JD5 PROPS!   Only 2 incomplete passes and he beat a playoff team in a hostile environment on the road on prime time when no one in media picked us to win.
Awesome game.  Both QB1s fr ea Teams did great.
Cincinnati is just embarrassing. Zach Taylor should be fired. He’s an idiot
Too bad they can only go so far with Rivera as their HC
So much for the next Brady
My Redskins just put the league on notice. Goodnight Cincinnati.
Distracted watching the Bills score go up every time another highlight play starts
should’ve been the first pick of the draft
If you told me the Jags and Bengals would start 0-3 I would think you are crazy
Stephen A Smith tomorrow: I mean that brotha is special!
Hey number 1 and 5 bengals, little less endzone celebrations until you win the game
Sorry Cincy
Joe cool is playing good but at 0-3 there almost toast. Bad because there the only team that could beat the chiefs.
JD5 His time is now🚦💫💯 #RaiseHail
These players are great players. Not such great dancers. Why are the celebrations part of the highlights?
Jayden daniels is a star
Taylor-Britt isn't saying a word, now
Wish the Bears had traded that first pick and drafted Daniels.
Best feeling as a redskins fan since 2012 with rg3. Please Daniel's continue learning how to slide before a hit!
Ur the best team in the league act and play like it 😂 jamarr chase,..ya jabronis lmao
Jayden Daniel is a veteran Already button >>>
The Bengals are so bad. They can't win a game
Let’s work on that secondary Washington and we might be decent 👊🏾
😂Boy the refs are against Cincinnati
1st game since 1944 with no turnovers or punts????? 😏🤷🏼‍♂️
As a lifetime Bengals fan, I once again have free time on Sundays.
Jayden $4 millon a year Burrow $52 million year 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
THIS ... I COMMAND!! -Serpentor (unofficial battle cry) LOL
Both teams O did great. Good game. #RavensFlock
Just saw Dan Quinn’s post game, looks like Lex Luthor, evil genius.
Dude better than Caleb... and im a BEARS fan
Jayden Daniels was the missing piece of the Commanders 💯
Amazing what a (much needed) change of ownership can do. So refreshing to have ownership that isn’t toxic.
No turnovers & no punts 😮
"Hail to the -Redskins- Commanders, fight for old DC."
Cincinnati 0-3 but we’ve been putting up some bangers
Not everyday u see rookies like JD playing like this bro is balling🔥
At the very least, Joe, Ja’marr, and Tee looked like the best qb receiver combination in the league. So whatever possessed the Cincinnati defense tonight was the only real problem we’ll have to fix for next week, in case Andy Dalton has a legacy revenge game
Ghetto thugs being ghetto thugs. Let's dance.
rbo my boys at the bengals this year are selling hard whats going onn
No punts no turnover
Caleb who? Lol
LSU was definitely in the house tonight representing on both sides!
Just give JD the rookie of the year already. He's doing more with less. Insanely good game where the defense collapsed in the 2nd half
Commanders offense won this game
after 14 years of being a commanders fan i cant believe we have jayden HTTR
That last TD THROW and catch was CRAZY
purdy on top
Dallas Cowboys fans are 💩 in their 🥾! There is a new sheriff in the division! 😂😂
As a bengals fan it was honestly embarrassing the way our defense played today. The offense played lights out but can only do so much when the defense cannot stop practically anything. This one’s on the defense.
As a Steelers fan I wanna congratulate the Washington Football Team
jayden daniels roty
The redskins are doing it
Some hope for Washington finally. Been at least 11 years since a qb like this
but but we were told bengals are the team to beat in afc !
0-3 .. Bungels still have a pulse
Thanks to you Commanders - You are the only thing likeable out of D.C. !!!
0:02 Commanders Commanders 😂
Bengals: 0-3 Failed.......
Jayden Daniels can throw!!!
The Bengals defense is 🚮
СПАСИБО КОМАНДИРАМ!
Jayden Daniels is so ahead of Caleb Williams when it come to development it is not even funny, it is hard to believe he is a rookie. All it takes is a decent offensive line and a head coach who knows what he is doing.
The Commanders are going to win the NFC East.
Jayden better than RG3
That's my quarterback😭
Chiefs fan here. Bengals are a clown show. The Bengals and their fans should never say the word Chiefs again. They no longer have the privilege to speak that name. Bengals lifetime losers.
Fire Zac and Lou our defense sold
Well I guess the .. can’t pass in the middle of the field, can’t read defenses, arm isn’t strong enough, and won’t throw on the while scrambling rhetoric is out the window. 3 games
As a bears fan all i can say is fml!
Is this video sped up?
Bengals defense the worst in the league
People called me stupid for saying Daniel’s should be the number one pick! Now look at
The Bungholes are 🗑️
Joe burrow is washed 👇
Watch out everybody they going to wake up tomorrow and say the Bengals can go 0-3 and still win the Super Bowl and he better than Patrick Mahomes , THEY MAY HAVE LOST TO COMMANDERS BUT THEY DKNE BEAT THE CHIEFS SO...... we about to hear it yall!!!!😂😂😂😂😂 watch see what say! Ahahaaaaaaaa😂😂😂😂 Chiefs may not win Superbowl but aint starting 0-2, i mean 0-3 now! BUT ITS OKAY REMEMBER THAT!😂😂😂😂😂
These announcers are awful it's only second quarter and they've said "their climbing back into it"  referring to Cincinnati or"  they're playing from behind"  they're only down 11 points
Good game by Washington, that late 4th qtr PI was similar to Kyle pitts non PI call
We have a QB , defense going to get better. Joe know there is plenty not work to do.
It appears Joe Burrow's "Super Bowl window" is indeed NOT always open every year. That would be Patrick Mahomes. Enjoy being 0-3 you bum poverty franchise.
Not that I'm a fan.... but... Make Washington the REDSKINS again!!!!
This was a shootout. And Washington  had the bigger gun in this game. Eckler was a BEAST! The Commanders O-line was like a juggernaut. Jayden Daniels was putting the ball anywhere he wanted to. Burrow and Chase had a good game, but the Bengals were playing catch up ball all night. One of the BEST week 3 games.
The Washington Commanders are 2-1🔴⚪️🟡🏹🏛️  Week 4 at Cardinals
Jayden played his heart out today. Great game for him, can’t wait to watch him go this season.
Not black on black crime Dave Chappelle when they play each other it's lsu on LSU crime bucknasty lmao
Bengals defense is horrible. Commanders looked unstoppable. Let’s get a top 5 pick and fire the head coach. Who Dey!
The Bengals are 0-3
I think my favorite thing about this game was how much fun Daniel’s was having 🥰
Time will tell things about Jayden Daniels we should know about. Time will tell my friend
What an interesting fact! Tonight's game being the 1st in League history to have no punts or turnovers.
I want to watch both games. why do you need to wreck it with the score of other game on screen the whole time
Which team 0-3 team makes the playoffs, Bengals or Jaguars?
The Bengals could go 0-8 and talking heads like Scott Van Pelt would still be saying "I still think the Bengals are good" 😂
I was very conflicted during this game 🧍🏽‍♂️
37 year old commanders fan checking in so happy we won this.
Bengals gonna BUNGLE!! 0-3…
Game of the week!
Someone cant count... 10 on the field?
Daniel’s is overrated smh
Hail to the Redskins, Hail victory.
Redskins look good this year
Get Bobby Wagner out of there
I'm gonna start calling Joe Burrow, Joe Borrow. He's borrowing the title of quarterback 😂
Patriots stupid for not drafting him or pendix jr
Lifelong Washington fan, couldn’t be more proud of JD tonight. 21/23 on the road in primetime with one of the nicest TD throws I’ve ever seen a Washington QB make. This was a statement game for the rookie and were a serious team! NFC needs to watch out for years to come because we’re coming! HTTC
What a brilliant game, This was a Monday Night Football classic
*Jayden >* rg3
The Bengal Defense line is as BAD as I suspected.
Jayden MF Daniels is a beast!!!!!! Big future ahead of the kid.
It might be time to admit that the bengals are not the same team they used to be. Losing at home to the Commanders ain’t the same as losing to the Chiefs in the playoffs
They just scored on a Cheifs play. I knew he came up with that play in KC.
A LSU reunion ❤
0 punts and 0 turnovers by the commanders is crazy. that happen since 1940.
I didn’t think Jaden Daniel’s was this good. Dudes a LEGIT QB! He’s got every weapon in the arsenal
Bears fans must be really crying to see Justin Fields being better in Pittsburg and a rookie with a worse lineup doing far better than Williams
Jayden Daniels had more touchdowns than INCOMPLETIONS, lol. 21/23 is CRAZY work
Lol, I can't wait to hear the excuses for Golden Boy Burrow. I want the same energy the media had for Baltimore and Lamar!!!
Defender draped all over Terry like a Bengal fur coat and 17 still grabs it.
What is wrong with the Bengals
Lol title screen commanders commanders...0:00
Electric bro
Daniels looked so chill the entire game, as if he's been doing it for a minute. Hope he will fare better than RG3.
0 - 3  ohh so good
Jayden Daniels those are some stats you do when u play madden. Lets command!!!
As a commanders fan I did not recognize my own team 😂😂😂. Defense? 🚮. Look completely lost
bills fans were watching this game
Why ain’t anyone saying the refs are making sure the bengals lose??? Oh guess yall only wanna b*tch bc chiefs out here beating teams down
Jd just got in the flow state thats all wont happen for another 6 weeks
For a team that's supposed to be "the best" in the AFC, they sure look like they want to miss the playoffs entirely. 0-3 is never a good spot to be in
Guarantee they make an excuse for Joe Burrow
Good game
wonder how the Bungholes can blame the refs for this one huh lolllllll
Most overrated team since the Mahomes era
Zac Taylor is the Bengals no.1 cheerleader who should be a coordinator or a QB coach. Can't send that man to lead a pack of dogs he's not a dog!😢 4 years o-line still has not come together and he's lost the locker room! Defense ain't nasty because he's soft flat out. He has no presence no identity! And Mac ain't money no more!
I hope Jayden changes his mind and gives that first touchdown game ball to his lineman Trent Scott who actually scored the TD.  Jayden will have many others, but that's going to be the highlight of Scott's career.  It would show a lot of class on Jayden's part and will go along way with his O line.
LETS GOOO JAYDEN!!!! They over looked you cause of Caleb! Let em know just cause you aint better then caleb you not no bum neither though!!💯💯👏👏👏
Daniel’s is everything Lamar is not.  A QB
Jayden!!!
Who Dey!? Kitty Cats!
The Commanders actually won this game on Monday Night Football. Jayden Daniels really played well tonight as he went for 21-23 for 254 yards and 2 touchdowns and completed 91% of his passes. Actually, the two teams did manage to do something no NFL teams have done in a game in 84 years. The network confirmed that Monday night's game was the first NFL game with no turnovers and no punts. Wow!!!
The bengals being 0-3 wasn’t on my list
As a Bengals fan: Respect to the Commies and Daniels, they lit us up! Good to see that team hit their stride. I think our offense still looked really good!
Looks like Washington got the better of the top 2 picks. Chicago may look back on this one and cry....
*The bungals season ended the moment burrow bleached his hair !👨🏼‍🦳*
Time for us to get NEW COACH
Why are the commanders good😭💀
Jayden daniels played a lights out game he had a 91% completion rate and 3 total tds and no turnovers lol he proved the moment wasn’t too big for him
LSU Heisman QB vs LSU Heisman QB
I said coming into this game that I couldn't lose as an LSU fan, all 3 of my players balled out tonight. JD5 for OROY!
Great win by the WASHINGTON REDSKINS!
It’s time to put that Joe burrow talk to bed. That defense carried them to the superbowl and it’s been downhill since. Not saying he’s not a good player but he’s highly overrated
Bengals need to bounce back
Seeing the Bengals going 0-3 so far has really caught me off guard. 😲
I fw the Bengals but where the defense that took yal to the superbowl its looking like a rebuild year so far
As a ravens fan , what has happened to the Bengals ?!?
Beautiful deep throw how the hell was he that open? Nothing cheap nothing deep. But that's a coverage call so that's on Anarumo.
Digging yourself a 0-3 hole that you’ll spend the rest of the season trying to overcome is exhausting work.
We are so cooked.
Second time I’ve seen the Skins not punt the ball (and not turn the ball over) and win the game! HTTR!
Miscommunication between Burrow and Iosivas
JAYDEN DANIELS IS HIM!!!
Jayden Daniels is him!
Where are the defenses in this game ??
Jayden is basically another Stroud, but he a better scrambler
That last TD was the loudest I have ever heard Joe Buck scream at the top of his lungs TOUCHDOWN!!! The loudest I’ve heard from him since the Minneapolis Miracle. Don’t know how Joe kept it together after that voice screaming excitement. Looked like he got very overexcited in that moment.
Bengals loser
Moss giving my fantasy team a 0.3pt win with that final touchdown 🎉💪
Bengals look horrible. 0-3 and Daniels outdueled his LSU counterpart Joe Burrow.
Trent Scott with the best TD dance ever
Washington Commanders winning? What is this?
Bengals D not 1 stop the whole game, 430 yards 30 first downs and a loss.  Unreal.
cali produces the best talent in all sports
Bengals thought wrong 😂
Washington has an offensive line Bears fans can only dream of.
Redskins got lucky Bengals Defensive Play calling tonight needs to be studied offense played great
What a game!! What a great week for football
Washington might have *FINALLY* found their first true franchise QB since Joe Theismann
This was the first NFL game to go all 4 quarters without a single punt or turnover since 1940!!!!  Insane
If Austin Ekeler is looking like Barry Sanders I'd say you have an issue on run defense.
During the 24 years that Dan Snyder owned the Redskins. The Redskins always had a math problem. They changed coaches, general managers, quarterbacks, and players but still lost. The least common denominator was Dan Snyder!!
Jayden Daniels won the Heisman trophy for a reason! Great bomb at the end! Something special
As a bengals fan we are done
ROTY fs
Scary Terry finally getting some yards? Maybe he can finally move off the bench in my fantasy
3:05 could have been easily called a penalty on the LT for holding Hendrickson. I've seen that type of play go both ways.
Joe Burrow is a man of character and a great quarterback, and I'm a Chiefs fan!
The Future is Bright in Washington. Happy for JD. Lions fan here sending ya'll love!
As an impartial viewer, I thought the refs won the game
Jayden Daniels is HIM, another great upcoming Dual Threat in this league 💪🏾👏🏾
LSU LSU LSU
JD is WAY BETTER than Caleb. He can read a defense, make progressions, throw the deep ball and is ACCURATE. Bears made a mistake. Bears should of took Dan O’s word🥶
As a Bengals fan, good job JD. You played amazing. But my thoughts on Cincy: our defense can stop the rush but can’t make a play downfield. Didn’t even force a single stop against the COMMANDERS. And Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase are the only things keeping our team alive. But GGs, let’s eat this and go to the next game
An amazing W tonight. Our secondary still suspect
How tf can something possibly get 16k views in 8 mins
What's the Bungles magic number for postseason elimination? 1? 2?
A true treat to watch as an LSU fan. No turnovers by either Jayden or Joe, both of them looked great especially Jayden, and just an all-around good game.
This was awesome to watch for any LSU fan! (Including myself) Jayden Daniels doing what he's been doing in college, and Joe Burreaux and Jamar Chase hooking up for 2 deep touchdowns was awesome! It's also very cool that JD5 is silencing the haters who were saying he would be a bust, so far he is the most reliable rookie QB in the class, just like how he was playing in LSU.
Who else thinks Daniel’s is gonna be an absolute unit!!
I’d let my wife sleep with Joe burrow if I could
Kicker misses a FG. You get nothing on a drive.
No need to watch the bills game OFMG😭
I suspected that Ekeler wasn't as washed as everyone seemed to think
LSU on LSU crime lmfao
Jayden Daniels was the missing piece for Washington. It’s nice to see McLaurin finally have a decent qb throwing to him!!
I was down 1 point in fantasy, that mclaurin TD literally won it for me 3-0 baby
As a Commanders fan, i don't know how to feel. Could this finally be the first franchise QB I've ever seen?  But also, that defense is aweful
Go back to Redskins.
Washington definitely has something is Jayden Daniels. He balled out tonight. As for the Bengals, at 0-3, you can't help but wonder if Zach Taylor's seat is starting to warm up. They're way too talented to be this bad looking.
Cinn gotta cry they got cheated cause they lost . Keep worrying  about the chiefs the rest of the league  ain't.  Cry cry cry !
That contract cursed Burrows. He needs to play like the rent is due or he is broke.
Everybody expected the Commanders to start with a better record than the 49ers, Ravens and Cowboys after 3 games. 😅
0-3 Bengals 🥴
Went for it on 4th and 2 and got a huge gain. That's on defensive personnel.
Redskins redemption HTTR
Once a bungle always a bungle! Again a rookie QB beats the bungles, absolute PATHETIC!
2 LSU quarterbacks playing against each other 🐅
I don't wanna call it yet, and I may be SLIGHTLY biased as a Commanders fan lol, but dare I say JD5 has a great rookie season like the last #2 pick in the draft before him? (CJ Stroud)
THATS MY QB🥹🥹🥹
The Commanders have got their franchise QB folks!!!!
Three weeks in and the panthers and giants have a better record than the bengals, just as everyone predicted 😂😂
Hail Yea! COMMANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jayden Daniels might get Rookie of the Year award
Welcome to the NFL Jayden Daniels!!!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Crazy work!!!!
0-3 Bungholes 🤣🤣🤣
If Ekeler is gashing you like that it's because you don't really have great athletes or stoppers on defense. At all.
I really dont want another RG3 situation. Please let this be different 😭
Joe Burrow. Theresa Lawerence. Dak Prescott. Allot huge contracts. All thieves.
Can you’ll feel the tables turning ! Washington is going to be a POWERHOUSE!!!!!
I've seen enough. Jayden Daniels is the GOAT 🐐
I think the ROY race just had a favorite emerge
I love JD5
I didn't like Daniels for nothing 😌
Redskins get the W
Watching this game I can really see the improvement (offensively) from Week 1 to 2 to 3, HTTC
REFS HELPED THE COMMANDERS !!!!!!!!!
Dope how the roty race is between Jayden and malik
Bengals defense against : Cheifs 🗿 Commanders 🤡
*The bungals will end up getting swept by the Steelers !🤣*
happiest I have been in years as a wsh fan. HTTR
Jayden Daniels is the best LSU QB, just above Jamarcus Russel.
As a Dallas Cowboys fan, I will say this, that rookie quarterback is better than DAK.
JD5 had more touchdowns than incompletions in this game. Holy Shxt!!!
Joe cant win a game without 10 superstars on the team
The DMV seeing the Commanders handle business on a prime time game is a glorious sight…JD lookin like a problem.
Fire Zac Taylor and take his staff with him and fire Duke Tobin for Burrows horrible contract and watching our entire team leave in free agency
How bout my redskins. Prime time football with a win. JD5 is HIM
HTTC!!!
Dont give me hope Washington.. 😭
Let's hear it for those Cincinnati Bungles!!!  😁🤣😂🤪😜😄😃👍
Scary Terry now has a QB😱😱😱
LSU breeding WRs and QBs apparently!
Stop these freaking commercials YouTube
Let’s GOOO COMMANDERS
Daniels is gonna be the next Stroud, calling it now
As a Redskins fan, so happy to see this finally. Great job Daniels!
Things looking up in Washington! #DMV
Jayden Daniels already better than Lamar
Only 6 teams in nfl history have gone to the playoffs after starting 0-3. And only one team in the last 24yrs have done that
joe burrow & his bungles 0-3, love it! Nice job Redskins
I picked Caleb Williams as the guy to win OROY before the season began   Is it too late to change my pick to Jayden Daniels?
Jayden Daniels put on a show. He made some big plays including that insane TD to Terry to seal the game.
If Jayden Daniels was a real quarterback, he'd be Lamar Jackson
I might be a little drunk since I consumed a whole thing of Budweiser,but As a fair,unbiased,and realistic Commanders fan, I think we are winning the suber bowl.
bengals downfall is so beautiful
NFL script is going crazy this week
this was the most random game of the year contender ever 😂😂
Daniels ballin out on MNF ⚡
Imagine giving up 38 points to a college offense.
The Commanders have a better record then the Bengals,Ravens,49ers and the Cowboys. And they still lead the NFC East. The NFL is so unpredictable and that is why we all love it.
After 20 years we got a QB let’s go
Terry Mclaurin TD hit my last leg on the parlay lol
what is this? me excited to see washington play for once? lol
🤨 These Redskins could be trouble for the NFC East.
Jayden Daniels is COLD BLOODED! 🥶
Should've been the first pick...
What a horrific night for the bengals defense

JD ROTY
daniels took it personal tonight wit this performance. hung 38 on the bengals while runnin a college offense
I was about to have a heart attack on that 3rd and 7 play, but Terry Mcluarin kept my heart intact
Jaden Daniel’s looked unstoppable!! He’s what rglll was but better! Hopefully this young man continues to shine and do amazing things HAIL TO THE SKINS!!
Crybaby Bengals lose again!!
Commanders: West Ham United! Bengals: Burnley!
Here is some info for you: This is the first game since 1940 to have no turnovers or punts.  Jayden  is the first rookie qb ever to have a 91% completion rate or better in a game, setting the record, all time, which means he had more tds than incomplete passes this game. Jayden now has the most 1st down runs of any qb so far this year.  He has just 28 less rushing yards less than RG3 through the first 3 games (Who holds the record among rookies) but he seems to be a more accurate passer so far compared to RG3 early on. He was constantly compared to Burrow at LSU being the first starter after him, so you know he wanted this real bad. Jaydens first td pass was to a linemen. The td drive that put the Bengals out of reach included a sack, 2 false starts, a fumble, a 2nd and 21, a 4th and 4, and a 3rd and 7 only to have him drop a perfect 30 yard td pass to Terry after a double move.
JAYDEN ONLY RUNS WHO??????
Jayden Daniels played awesome!!
I know it's early in the season but the race for the NFC East is becoming very interesting!
Washington got a Franchise QB? 🤔
Jayden is astounding fr. Also they should've had 45 if jayden and mclaurin were on the same page earlier. He reminds me so much of rg3 and as a commanders fan it makes me shed a tear
Like this if you like football season
we're so back
🎉
The second pick in the draft is the new number one 😭
Jayden Daniels ROY! This guy is playing lights out!!!
THATS MY QB!!!!
Wildflower is pleased
Jayden Daniels had more touchdowns than incomplete passes. Dude played like a 10 year veteran tonight.
JD5 4 OROY
on 3rd and 7 💀
i got messaged by alot of people to react to this one so something crazy definetly happened
Bengals defense is one of the worst I've seen, no stops to the Commanders on any of their drives
JD5 rookie of the year.
Thank you Washington for not throwing this one. - Steelers fan
Both punters could’ve taken the day off tonight and no one would’ve noticed
If Lamar Jackson was a real quarterback, he’d be Jayden Daniels
Jayden is him. Enough said.
JD5 rookie of the year.
A good quality win for the Commanders and their ‘nice college offense’
Glad to see the Commanders finally find their QB.
Hey bills mafia
Since when were the Bengals this bad?
Jayson Daniels is him
JAYDEN DANIELS KINDA NICE WITH IT
Let's be honest, Daniels has a great future with the commanders. He was unstoppable tonight.
Nice victory!
Your first career passing touchdown going to an offensive lineman is a crazy stat   Repent and praise the Lord for He is holy and He is true 🙌
