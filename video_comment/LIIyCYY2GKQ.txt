2:46 that joke is not sitting well. cause Arch sucks
Texas would've beem better off with Quinn coming back for another year. Manning is so overrated! 😂
Now Texas wishes Quinn Ewers was back. 😂😂😂
3:18 aged like a fine wine.
Texas spent more on their  teamed than ohio state
Texas and Georgia are beat up but Tennessee is flat hilariously disarrayed!
I always thought that you needed a team in the game to win the game?  If the SEC keeps losing in the Semi-Finals, wait for the what will become a full unhinged mockery video.
Yeah the last thing I need is the Chelsea of college football providing motivation.
That was hilarious..Go Bucks !!
1:30 GO BUCKEYES
NIL
Texas didn't get blown out.
Things are a little bit brighter for the S.E.C. with Florida winning the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2007!
1:06 Hello Fellow Monarchs
Ouch.  The Nico thing is funnier now.
NICO is mid!!! LOL😂
Why is Georgia afraid of Ohio State??🤣🤣🤣  We've beaten them in the playoffs every time we played them🤣🤣🤣
tOSU with a southern accent? hmm
I'm a Buckeye fan and even when theyre making fun of us and the B1G Ten it's funny.   I do wonder though why everyone keeps ignoring that two or three teams spent more NIL money than Ohio State.
1:06 the hello kills me
anyone coming back for the Beck had his Lambo stolen comments?
Go Bucks
HaHa how many of those 433K views are OSU fans😆
"Hi, I am THE Ohio STate University!" Everyone (including the director) dives under a table. That was absolutely priceless! The "My leg is supposed to be evelated" was the cherry on top!
I’m hoping for a Texas / Ohio State skit with them playing the first week this upcoming season.
Mid huh, just like this episode. SEC shorts keeps recycling the same gags, they need fresh ideas.
Yep, Ohio State - the place with an athletic department that’s $38M in debit, after buying their championship with a $20M+ roster.  Now both coordinators are gone to better jobs.  Let’s see how Ohio State handles that, maybe Saban can give them some advice…..
😁 never thought The Ohio State would be the motivational speaker 😁
Big 10>SEC. GO Bucks! 😎
Ohio state won
and why does Herbstreet closeout SEC Shorts - can't get Peyton Manning?
SEC Shorts quit sucking up to Herbstreet... or else go do B1G10 shorts.
BIG rules
Oh! and Mike Bobo sucks. UGA has already fired him once. WHY did we re-hire him?
Never ask A woman: her weight A man: his salary SEC Shorts: who beat Georgia in the playoffs
I'm not getting dunked on by Neland North LoL 😂😂😂😂
Neland North 😂😂😂😂😂
LoL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:29 working with a college football team, that is 100% accurate. We felt our best playing right away at noon rather than sit around for 7 hours just waiting
I loved this. Go, Buckeyes! OH!
"HELLOOOOO!"
Missouri was the only SEC Team to not lose to a B1G team in the bowl games.
Alabama saying there might be some "naysayers" out here is wild 🤣🤦‍♂️
Tennessee spent 16 mil on one qb lmao and Texas spent 22.5 mil missing the 20 mil Ohio state spent spend smarter losers❤️😂
My team just joined the sec this year and it was a pitiful year them. OU had multiple reasons that it did not meet the sec standard. I do believe the sec is year in year  out the best conference I look forward to getting better recruits just because of the conference. But a great video. Love the sarcasm and humor.
BIG 10!!!
The Ohio State University is your college national champion
lol they keep talking about the NIL funding to cope. This is hilarious coming from the most bankrolled conference of the last 15 years at least. Not to mention OSU used their NIL to bring back and keep veteran talent. Not to poach and acquire as much new talent as possible. And they aren’t even top 3 In all time NIL. Looking at you TX and OR. It’s always OSU against the world because of the ignorant sec coping arguments. Big babies if it’s not the BCS being able to make it so you get softballs in the original 4 team playoffs. Hoping and praying for a guard change. Gonna be harder to hide from tough competition In a 12 team playoff now.
Michigan would have been the more appropriate motivational speaker.  Ohio State can't even win their own conference or beat their rival.  Michigan would have beaten all y'all if they didn't get shafted by Harbaugh at the QB position and coaching staff.  He didn't recruit very well at QB other than JJ and he took so long to leave and take coaches with him that sherone had no way of getting anything from the portal at QB.  They still had a defense by the end of the season that nobody could score on
🤣
Funny!😄
The bama part killed me😂😂
Go Buckeyes!!
Go Buckeyes 😂😂😂
That speaker is a nation champ now
When we going to get a big ten shorts or the lost department don’t by stingy sec shorts you owe use 3 more vids
Outstanding.
we need a cfb season finale short of the B1G Show, poking fun of the midwest and northern aggression
The NIL is here. You're over. You can't compete with BiG10 money. You just can't.
The fact that ohio state won the national championship makes this even funnier.
So Ohio State won the Natty.... Does that mean we're getting B1G shorts again?
Lol, let's pretend these SEC schools didn't spend a bunch of money themselves on NIL money!
true LOL at tOSU!!
Here after OSU won the title.  Go Bucks!
'B1G          Shorts'           has its revenge ...         🤌🚫💩🚫💩🚫🤌
Nice job loved it
Here after, ohio states victory
Too many women in these now. Y'all are getting less funny by the episode.
How the sec misses Saban 😂😂😂😂
Texas spent more than Ohio State…
The Mississippi State comment was just mean and uncool.
Funniest thing this was also a down year of the big ten
Love the new girl and her southern accent 😅
“Maybe this conference deserved to get clowned by Brett Bielma in the bowl game”  Haha yeah they did. South Carolina fans were some of the sorest losers I’ve ever seen. The SC players didn’t even know they were playing Illinois, they thought they were playing Syracuse 😂
Why is georgia hiding, didnt they beat them in 2022
I think Ohio St should have at least a black eye while he’s talking to the sec
ND
Always bet on buckeyes.
Texas- Book of Manning 🗿
Let’s go Irish
I thought nussimier would come in because the rest of the SECs best QBS have gone into the draft
Hahaha !!!!
Love it!
This is what parity feels like.
We keep beating ourselves up in conference play.
Ohio State is hardly a bastion of success. Take away NIL and…well…same old same old.
I actually got scared when he said Quinn ewers was coming back
It’s called The Ohio State University!
SEC it just means more
Go Irish!!!!
Lol
at least y'all know how to laugh at yourself. the Suckeyes still "need to learn how to lose". and yeah, sucks for y'all that now everyone can pay players.
Ohio State and Notre Dame deserved to be in final as they both ran the gauntlet. The SEC must have pissed off a lot of non SEC fans because of SEC dominance in the past. From my perspective college football seems to go in cycles SEC, Big 10, Eastern schools, Big 8, all conferences have good and bad eras. I've been around a long time and remember several eras of different conferences dominating at different times.
So basically now that everyone is allowed to pay players the rest of cfb has caught up. It's almost as if the sec has been illegally been paying players for decades.
GEORGIA PAID MORE THAN OHIO ST AND TENNESSEE AND TEXAS AND OREGON 😂
Go Bucks!
That’s funny 😂😂😂
😁  SEC y'all funny great motivation speaker 😁
Go Buckeyes
Ohio State knocked two of them out.
Money has officially and finally ruined college football. Great job NCAA.
LMFAO 😂😂😂
Hail State!
As always, Lil Vandy was a bad team this year, but they did alright in the SEC. Nick Saban quitting out of the blue like he did, just destroyed the SEC's chances at winning a National Championship this year. Alabama will never have a good team ever again!
Need to keep the neyland North thing going so that tenn has a place to go to learn what some good ball
That naysayers comment was COMPLETELY unhinged. That was WILD
Now ALL The SEC says, well thank God for Basketball season, not just UK fans
Actually THE HIGHEST NIL school, is sitting there in burnt orange and white, the one with the neck brace. Btw... Ain't nothin long bout dem horns. Bahaha 😆
These vids are almost great. Their one problem?... Herbstreit at the end. BLAH 😝🤐
As a Michigan fan thats rebuilding yea....it's been a rough 2 years for the SEC.  And the NIL isn't going to make it better for you..... B1G.
She is so adorable with her southern accent
This was funny.   Like the time I wore an OSU Buckeyes t-shirt to Orange Beach Alabama in 2022.
4 Quarters of F🍀ck You Football  Go Irish
As a Texas fan:   At least we can say we had a pretty good run our first year in the SEC  Idk if you could really call it a “down year” for us. Trust me, Texas fans have seen worse seasons.   However, as far as blunders in a big game, that Ohio state game was about as bad as it gets, if not the worst Texas blunder I’ve seen. It’s worse than the time we lost to Texas Tech off an easy end zone corner pass :(
Poverty conference
The best part was when they dragged Bobo!  Keep that energy.
Excellent
Midwest rising!
B's like that sumtimes.
I guess this is comedy?
The worst thing that happened to the SEC is the NIL.
He should have said bless your hearts after that Quinn Ewers dig
sec only won like umptimes in a row , really sec is going nowhere
Just throw more money it ,taxpayers Don't mind. 😮😊Generate so many millions no student even has to pay tuition and have ncaa approved tutor for each class. Hehe 😮😊
Go Big Ten
SEC have a bake sale to raise money
Ewers is GONE
I was expecting Ole Miss to be somewhere in here and in serious denial.
Excuse me, THE Ohio State.  We did beat you.  With a team that was decimated after we lost almost everyone to the NFL.   Let’s Go Blue!
Ohio state whooped on 2 of them.
*O-H*
I see Josh laughing back there behind the table
Vanderpimp was sorely missed here.
"...Thanks for the tune-up game.  It's not often you get your third string freshman quarterback some reps in a playoff game."  "Happy to be of service."  LMFAO
"Ouch. Maybe this one should've gone to the transfer portal."  Love when SEC Shorts digs on itself.  😂
Ohio state!  😂
Actually it should bb king the thrill is gone!  😂😂😂
And the Academy Award goes to....... SEC SHORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As a Michigan fan I was perplexed all year why Manning was not starting for Texas. He was clearly the better player. In fact if Arch had started against us in Ann Arbor that game would have been 63-10 or so. Confused at the loyalty some coaches have to upperclassmen in an era where players can and do transfer at will. Play the guy that gives you the best chance to win!
Cute. So who does Ohio State bring in as a motivational speaker on how to beat Michigan? Even if they beat a depleted ND team and win the natty they still have a Michigan problem. 😏
Funny and True!😆😆
To all you Big 10 fans that say you are the best and the SEC is dead, win a national championship 8 years in a row, and then be a part of one for another 8 years afterwards. Then you can talk. There is a reason you don't hear anyone chanting BIG 10.
Sec was still the strongest overall conference from top to bottom. The big ten overall is maybe a level below the SEC, because the bottom of the conference is so bad. But the top of the conference in the big 10 might be a little better right now...
In his defense, he was up against the number one red zone defense in the country
Wish Texas would have went independent. Woulda shown how flawed it is to have independents, now they’re just another SEC team praying to scheduling gods.
Can't take a crack at tOSU's NIL when Texas is right there with an even higher payroll
Still better than the ACC... 🤷🏻
The part with Alabama at the windows was amazing. LMAO
What did GA fans expect after Ole Miss kicked them up and down the field?
It is not like Ohio State has done anything recently either. One good season of note out of how many? Poor choice on the motivational speaker thing. The last time they even sniffed a National Championship other than this season was 2014 ... a DECADE ago.   **To qualify for Sniffing a National Championship game one has to actually be IN the Championship game and lose it**
Listen, All Naysayers Knew.
I did expect Vandypimp to be their motivational speaker! Hey, they beat ranked opponents (Texas hadn’t), won their bowl game, and still feel elated about their winning season! And then there’s that Vandy player from a few years ago that could be quoted, “You come to our house! We’ll show you how to play SEC football!” (A paraphrase, but you get the gist).  But seriously, WELL DONE, SEC SHORTS. Another stellar season of videos that deserve repeating in the off season.
Ok im a BUCKEYE, and I just subscribed. This is hilarious.  Yes we have won a lot but haven't won anything. Lost to our rival 4 years in a row. But have won the most games since 2000. But it's about natty's and your rival.
Funny how we all get to pay players and the field is suddenly even…the timing is just uncanny
Alabama better be happy they're getting to look in the window. They're done.
Please believe in Jesus while there is time. When calamities strike turn to Jesus and count on him.  Repent and baptized for the forgiveness of sins. Jesus is the only way. Have faith believe.
Aww, ya'll picking on poor State.
Beck was not all that. Let Miami have him.
… lose to Missouri. Then you get a shot at the title next year.
could have got Herbie to represent tOSU
The bacon of eggsellence
Nice cap off.   Although I hope you do yearly grade episode.   It won’t have the Pirate tear jerker ending, but it’s still always good.
I don't really think Georgia fans are upset about Beck going to Miami.
ahhhh man, transfer portal? Dats cold from your sponsor. But funny AF. Go Notre Dame and TD Jesus.
As an Ohio State fan, this is beyond hilarious.
This season gave us VANDY PIMP, therefore, excellence!   XD
No Indy slander here
Unbelievable 2024 that's all I can say. Crazy times.
I was waiting for Vandepimp's music when they talked about a guest speaker.
How to start a winning tradition at The Ohio State University: hire an alumni who weaseled out of a coaching job at Florida by claiming a medical issue as your coach.
How do I know I’m cooked? The rage level spike way too high when OSU was mentioned.
Good that people are finally seeing that the sec is the most overrated and overhyped division in all of sports
As an Ohio State fan I loved every minuet of this
Nick Saban wasn't available due to scheduling conflicts.
The naysayer joke was a deep cut lol
Will absolutely say... Our "best" quarterback going to Miami... Beck is not the best in the SEC! :D
Saban the king is dead. The SEC is no more!
Sideline interference king lol
Honestly, TN performed as per tradition.
Hey, you still have women's basketball.
MIZ-ZOU
Beck is in no way at all the best QB in the SEC lmfao
As an Ohio state fan, this is absolutely hilarious
Lmfao i love these 😅
The audacity to make an NIL joke to Ohio State with Texas sitting right there...
Having THE Ohio State University is the most troll move you can do
Hilarious!  At least my LSU Tigahs took care of business so they weren't featured...  Scott/BPG
my school being revealed as the motivational speaker made me way too happy lmao
Alabama is actually only outside cuz Ohio state has feared for its life and refused to be in the same building since letting mac jones drop 50 on em
Neyland North and king of sideline interference had me rolling 🤣🤣
When do they give out grades
While this is funny, and it very funny, let us keep in mind since 1996, Alabama has played for eight titles and won six, Auburn played for two and won one, Tennessee has a title, Georgia played for three and won two, LSU and Florida played for four each and won three each. Bad year? Sure. It won't last.
The best part of this episode might be the accents 😂
The motivational speaker hadn't won a natty since I was in high school.
Best QB going to Miami? DJ Lagway is staying at Florida.
Ngl Carson Back leaving UGA might be a blessing in disguise (knock on wood)
Hahaha love it.
Best short series on YouTube.  Top notch writers and comedic actors. Love every single one. Keep it up guys.
Ty Simpson's going to Miami? News to me...
Uhhh, Mizzou won their bowl game,,,,
Cant believe you dissed Vandy by not acknowledging their win over Tech
That's sick! ILL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
SEC Shorts is the highlight of my Youtube!  Its amazing what happens when the other conferences start paying players like the SEC has done forever!!  Cant wait till next year!
Every squirrel gets a nut some times
"THE Ohio State University..." 😆
How about Mizzou being the ONLY SEC team to beat the B1G in a bowl game this year! They also had no problem with Ohio St. in the Cotton Bowl last year, but let's not forget, "they don't belong in the mighty SEC."
Should have ended one of two ways:  Michigan and Northern Illinois congratulating each other on beating a team that made the finals.  or   Vanderpimp celebrating that his team was one of the highlights of the 2024 season.
Saying carson beck is the best qb is just a bad references
Nico was a FRESHMAN.
I think there are more people who think Nico is good than mid. He did have to shoulder most of the offense against OSU, we had multiple drives that continued just because he put the team on his back. Definitely had some early career struggles, but i'll call him mid if next season we get more of the same
Someone make Lane Kiffin watch this, please.
it would have been more embarrassing if Notre Dame was part of the motivational speaker presentation
For the record, TEXAS spent more NIL money on their roster.
Why no mention or appearance of the Irish?
RMFT
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the naysayer comment was wild 💀💀
You can't spell second without S-E-C.
Petition for Vanderpimp to be the motivational speaker
Texas did not get beat down
Best one yet!!!
1:41 talk about irony. Georgia spent $18M on their roster and Texas spent $22M. I love the $20M narrative tho as if OSU is in a league of their own with NIL
Big Ten spanked dat azz. FYI Michigan beat Bama twice in 2024 😂😂😂
The hair on Tennessee. - LOL!  That said, I wouldn't call what happened to Texas a beat down. The game literally came down to one yard.  Now, what happened to Tennessee... that was a beat down. Turns out they probably should have been more focused on how to win the game rather than on how to plant a flag or throw the goal posts in a river.
The SEC is a basketball conference. 😂
Dark? You think this season is dark for y'all?! Try being an ACC fan. Y'all spoiled rotten. Things can always be worse; way worse.
Sark abandoning the run on the final drive is the reason we have this gem😂🎉🎉
Mississippi State caught some strays
I'm not understanding why Tennessee has a thick southern accent and the other two dont. And moreover the head of the SEC does too.
Just like the performances in the CFP & Bowl Games, this was SEC SHORTS worst of the year 👎🏽
Step 1: win a championship with your current head coach before talking to Georgia about championships.
I was really hoping for Matt Foley to appear
This is top 3 SEC Shorts. Knocked it out of the park and Bama at the end was the cherry on top!
As a buckeye, texas had some absolute dimes in the stands… 😮‍💨 might have to open a regional office there
As an OSU fan great to see my team in one of these shorts!
Secretary Booty Juice 😂😂😂
Ohio state talking about toughness good one 13-10
It naysaya's no hard "R"...careful...lol
Since we’re not good at football anymore can we get SEC shorts for basketball?
Naysayers..HA, the beginning of a terrible year and a half.
Mizzou won our bowl game tho :’)
Love her accent! 😄
Good episode.  This would have been a good time to feature the Vanderbilt “pimp” again since Vandy won the bowl game.
Should've gotten Tim Tebow to motivate. Have a little Urban Meyer action.
Ohio State would never do this. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.
Bring on Vanderpimp!!!!
Is that crybaby Kirk?
Nico is mid
The Yankees keep on winning
BIG TEN 💪 💪 if u wanted a real motivational speaker, you should have hired Michigan!! After giving ohio another beating we gave them the motivation to take it out on the sec and Oregon!
I think that "naysayers" joke went over a lot of heads lol
The audacity to bring Ohio State to talk to the SEC when they're like 4-14 against SEC teams.
Lol did she say the SEC’s best QB is going to Miami? 😂 No wonder they suck so bad this year 🤣🤣
Lamborghini not Ferrari
Step 1: Only schedule 1 or 2 good teams for your entire season.
Where was Hope?  Missed opp to have Hope talk about UF, Bama, Ole Miss, etc
UT made the final 4. The others should be embarrassed.... They all lost to two teams playing in the finals.
As an Ohio State fan, this is peak.
Great season SEC shorts
"I'm not getting dunked on by Neyland North and Sideline Interference King..." As a Vols fan - this was great! 😂
Just needed the Toy Chickens and an Illinois taunting gesture!
OH MY GOD YES! THE Ohio State making it in an SEC shorts video 🙏
I love SEC Shorts but tbh this new college playoff setup and transfer portals has me not really feeling college ball anymore. I am not even old but I feel old saying this, "the Saban era was the best college football time there ever was and it will never be that good again."
Ironic that a former Big 10 QB is the spokesperson for the SEC Shorts!  Just sayiN, on the field doesn’t seem to be the only place where... well, you get it.
The only thing worse than the SEC this season is her fake southern accent. Cringe. 🥴
Meh, our girls are still hotter. See: this video.
😂😂😂!!!!
My life is complete with Illinois "lovingly" referenced in an SEC Short.  Thank you guys!
All Texas did was dominate OSU for the last 3 quarters of the game.  Y’all can GTFO with that “beat down” mess.    Texas lost an absolute fluke of a game,  otherwise they’re repping the conference in the CFB final while yall chant SEC.
They should make the Vandy pimp walk mandatory every show.
Ohio State just got lucky. Texas will be back next year!
Only missing Michigan waiting in the hallway to jump Ohio.
Did she our best QBs going to Miami. Lol😂😂😂
Who said Carson beck was our best qb in the sec. That guy is a joke and it’s gonna show next year.
hope OSU wins so we get another episode of the B1G Show, it was the best skit by far last season
OH...IO!
hey at least Vanderbilt won their bowl game.  Vanderbilt was lowkey the best SEC team this season.
The nineties bills?   That was out of nowhere and……I laughed so hard
My sincere thanks to Renasant Bank for their continued support of this program.
It's funny and sad at the same time. Good job as usual  !
As a Texas Longhorn fan, all I can say is "Too Soon."  😥 I'll watch it again in July.
You're right, you didn't ask them to hire Ohio State. What you got was THE Ohio State.   Get used to your Big 10/14/18 masters.
Where is Hope? Miss her.
As an FSU fan, seeing the entire SEC fall and not win a national championship game for the 2nd year in a row is heartwarming. (Although I was hoping Texas would've won)
The SEC Shorts Crew always explains exactly what’s going on in SEC football in less than 5 mins than all the famous media pundits combined.
Rooting for ND glad classless texas took the L also hope BLOWHIO ST losses as well another fanbase wirh no class
O-H
Tennessee fan here... Nico is mid (hope to see huge improvement going into 2025)
Listen Vandy winning a bowl game tops the fact that none of the SEC teams were good this year and most likely won’t be good enough for a while.😂
We need Regina and Vandypimp in the loss claims dept!! 😂😂
Good, but not great.  Great would have been Vandy and Florida being the motivational speakers.
Naysayers has to be one of my favorite college football references lmao
Hello! 💀💀💀
Best one yet
Go Bucks, bring home the Natty,  Big 10 two years in A row
Should've had Missouri and Vanderbilt as your speakers, since they won their bowl games.
As a Aggie that strip, scoop and score was fantastic! It made my night seeing all those tu fans in the stands in shock!
A.Manning 1st start will be in  Columbus
As an Illinois fan, I’m just glad we got to be part of a single punchline lmao
You know Mizzou should have been the motivational speaker, you since we're the only ones who can apperently beat the B1G.
2:32 It’s funny because OSU only plays for one trophy, the Illibuck, and not every year.
90s buffalo bills would have been my expectation as well
Notre Dame beat the SEC Champs and no mention of them
Gotta get the end of year report cards!
😂😂😂
Lets go Buckeyes😂💯
Good googly Mook. Like momma used  to say, ya'll need take a deep breath and count to 10. Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn ever now and then.  Tomorrow is another  day, and as God is our witness, the SEC will rise again.
The funniest part about texas rn is that their next game is at ohio state
Ahhh yes the school that every team below the mason dixon line loves to dunk as the motivational speaker 🤣🤣 I love it!
The future is the BIG 10. Just not that nimrod.
The problem is the south is spoiled with talent. That talent is spoiled with nil now. Theyre not getting up for these games bc half of them are thinking about leaving. They all see greener grass. And the big 10 has a horrible record against the sec as of the last 20. Ohio state especially.
In DJ Lagway we trust
The naysayers are coming from in the room!!  (Always has been)
Ur going to live in a van down by the river
Hahahaha well at least we can joke about it
As an Indianapolis resident Im honored we were mentioned in such a derisive way!  Probably a 1st on this channel. That said, Indy is the HQ of the NCAA and more importantly, the "Crossroads of America" as Highway 1 goes/went through the heart of the city.  Indy is nicely centered in the middle of Big10 country. (Well, pre-PAC teams joining)
😂 didnt mizzou beat ohio st last year?
Lay off of Texas all I'm gonna say❤
Its the dark ages for the conference
That fake southern accent though
Amen on the screen pass. Bobo aka Bozo
At least LSU won their bowl game
THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
Hahahah!!!  BRUTAL!!!!
I Love SEC shorts!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Mizzou, with the biggest Midwestern accent: "Hey, we at least beat our Big 10 Opponent."
Carson Beck definitely wasn’t the best qb in the SEC.
Who does anybody else play? UNRANKED TEAMS.
Where was Hope?????
SEC is in trouble if the NCAA doesn’t step in and put a cap on the NIL deals and the transfer portal. Outside of Texas the SEC just doesn’t have the NIL money to compete with the deep pockets of the BIG.
The SEC needs a reminder they aren’t all that great
As a Ga. fan, I'm still not gonna watch basketball. I'll just watch replays from those games 2-3 years ago.
I don't need the sec to win I just need Oregon to lose.
End of season report cards, please!!!
Love it as always😅😅! Thanks for actually making college football fun to watch again!  Would have been nice having michigan walk in after bama wearing the pimp outfit!!
SEC Shorts is the only thing elite about the SEC these days.
THIS WASN'T JUST BAD IT WAS TERRIBLE, NOT FUNNY AND VERY STUPID!  Hopefully, they'll be doing better next year...  I mean when did SEC Shorts only worry about Football, Tennessee fans should be not even worried about Football, and Florida and Kentucky should be coming in saying why are you people still here?  Tennessee you can stay if you can keep the game under 30 this time!
The irony is that Georgia has more national championships in the last 10 years than all the other teams combined in that room 😭😭😭
Notre Dame should have been in this video.  Ohio State didn't even beat Georgia the very best SEC team.  Notre Dame did and they're going to beat ohio state.
not sure why UT girl has thick southern accent while the GA guy sounds like he's from out west.
0:33 Jones mentioned in a SEC short 🎉
Mississippi State taking the jabs Mizzou used to take, I'm so proud of the Tigers
Why would Georgia be afraid of Ohio State.  I'm telling you right now NOTRE DAME going to beat down Ohio State.  So while you're ready to give them the trophy understand they still have to go through TOUCHDOWN JESUS!!!
Indianapolis is now big-time.  Mentioned on SEC shorts!!!  You all are welcome to visit any time to experience the hospitality. Proud day for Hoosiers everywhere.  Keen points of interest for you all:  Bill Monroe bluegrass festival in Bean Blossom and the Ball jar Museum in Munich.  C'mon by any time.  LOL
I think we can all agree, Texas didn't get a Natty so the year isn't a complete waste.
Texas paid more for their roster than Ohio State.
As an diehard canes fan, I approve this SEC Short. Thank you Georgia.
I mean outside of the CFP, the SEC had a winning record in their bowl games, but of course this also just shows how much people don’t care about bowl games anymore in the CFP era. None of the SEC teams that won their bowl games were mentioned on a channel that makes comedy videos about the SEC.
Thanks for the Buckeye appearance. Is there any way to get some SEC Shorts during the off season? You guys are hilarious.
COACHING CUTE WILL ALWAYS GET YOU BEAT....RUNNING THE BALL IS HOW YOU WIN
Would have loved to see a Tony Robbin’s cameo on this one. Thanks for the great videos this season
Seeing Ohio state in anything sec still makes me throw up in my mouth, smh. Great season yall.  Gotta say the vandy-pimp is best character ever!!
Indianapolis slander will not be tolerated
Honestly, this is every SEC program right now...except Vandy.  We put forward a terrible effort this year. Truth hurts.
Ohhhhhh!   H!!!
Why is UGA hiding from Ohio St.? 😂
as a tennessee fan im just happy to be here 😂😂
SEC may be in a "down year", but things aren't so bad that we need inspiration from someone who hasn't beaten their biggest rival in <checks calendar> 1,870 days.
Y’all stabbed me in the heart with OSU, then brought laughter tears to my eyes and a heart filled with happiness with bama looking for Hope😂😂
ILLINOIS MENTIONED ON SEC SHORTS
5…it was 5!
The SEC did not need Texas. Texas needed the SEC to stay relevant.
Her accent is atrocious.
Saddest part is knowing there'll be no more shorts😢 please expand into March Madness/ College World Series stuff.
2:19 as someone who was at the citrus bowl (rooting for illinois ofc) watching that hillbilly idiot shane beamer lose his mind over a simple (and awesome) taunt was hilarious😂
😂 my favorite part was when ohio st talked about being tough
Motivational speaker that came frightfully close to getting beat by Nebraska at home?! Lol, please! 😂
Quinn Ewers announcing he’s hitting the portal and returning to Ohio State.  What about that? Either that or Notre Dame.  He will be more coveted at those places than the NFL at this time.
Harsh. The SEC loves to kid.
Would have been better to have HOPE than Ohio State
Well Well Well Ohio State with 2/3 of the eliminations…by the way does the report card thing come soon
You had to make fun of the Buffalo Bills from the 90s I hate the the SEC but you guys are hilarious however the bills actually made it 4 years in a row to a to the Super Bowl
Looks like Tennessee, Georgia and Texas are going to be living in a van down by the river
As an Ohio State fan, we would like Vanderpimp to make an appearance during the title game  The only good thing theSEC has produced all year
SEC is so great that a Big12 team (Texas) won the SEC in its first year.
Sec is so overrated
Where’s “The Big 10 show”? Maybe with a guest appearance of Vanderpimp (and the return of the poptart mascot?)
Oooph the out of nowhere Indianapolis dig
When Alabama was talking about there might be some nay sayers out here, you know he didn't mean "nay sayers." ha
Wow 3 Weeks without an SEC Shorts was horrible
Love how Alabama has been so quickly tossed aside from the elites.😂
3:14 😂Bama got humbled
Grades of SEC Colleges when?
I’m born and raised in the Deep South and hear accents all day. But this lady is trying way too hard with it. Sorry. I’m not trying to be a jerk, it’s just hard to listen to. I miss Hope
#7 on trending is crazy
Comical, as usual.  But one year of OSU dominance doesn't negate the SEC's run of excellence, nor does 2 years of Big10 prominence equate to a sustainable switch in power conferences.  Fact still remains: top to bottom, SEC is the better conference.  And the parity in the SEC this past year came about simply because of the AL dominance - everyone else had to up their game.  This past year in the Big, you had what: OSU, OR, and Penn St.????  Look at the top teams in the SEC.  OSU won't be able to make a run like AL.  And they will be trying to do it against what few teams can challenge, but of course, Mich qill always get included in that list, even if they face OSU with a 0-11 record (PSYCH!).  And Penn State will be the GA of the 90's - always the bridesmaid, least as long as Franklin gets to hang around.
HAHAHA! I think there might be some NAYSAYERS out here! That is GOLDEN!!!!!! hahahaha Roll Tide!
Went dark when saban left
To be fair, Texas wasn’t beat down … the game down to a fourth quarter goaline situation …
Nice to see Michigan's children branching out into the job market!
"He only had five tries in a row."  The refs did everything they could to help the tea-sips win.
I’m a longhorn fan and it’s sEwers fault!!!!
Garbage just like the SEC, playing field is even as Colin said Bama, Auburn etc who been paying players Can't pay players like them schools up north.
The Bacon or Beacon?
Where's was pimp vandy?
3:24 Pat McAfee: I see what you did there.
I miss SEC CFB
Tennessee looking rough. 😬
Lmao. YouTube glitched and was running Fredoontv in the background. I didn't even question it because it matched the first frame. 😂
SEC SHORTS are 🔥
Screen passes! It's the Mike Bobo way! Seriously I want Bobo gone. I can't deal with more awful playcalling. Like how are you so bad when you have TODD MONKEN'S PLAYBOOK?!?!?! And it doesn't help that our receivers couldn't catch a 5-yard hitch if their lives depended on it and our o-line folded
Commissioner Lauren: "I've asked our marketing firm to send us a motivational speaker..."  Me: "Pease be Hope, please be Hope, please be Hope..." "Ohio State Eric: "Hello!"  Me again: "EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!!" 😆
I really think they should do a funny parody on how the SEC is so dominant in basketball this year and is becoming a basketball conference. Have all of the football people against the basketball people. That’d be great 😆
Tennessee won the baseball World Series, has the number 1 men’s basketball team, and we made the CFP, we’ll be fine.
Don't worry. The mizzou empire got this.
It's c🤕ld... I can't feel my legs.
Michigan 13, SEC Motivational Speaker 10
They only thing that would have hit harder than OSU addressing the SEC would be ND, but they made the right call. Never let it be said they aren't equal opportunity offenders.
Paying college athletes/NIL was the worst thing that ever happened to college football. You don't have to recruit, coach or mentor. You just have to pay the most.
Maybe learn engrish and yall can learn how to play football🏈
Bama has nothing to say since losing to Michigan
Why do Miss State like that? It's true, but still mean...
Beck was not the best QB At UGA ...our best lost the sugar bowl..
Go home horrible cliche southern accent, you're drunk. It's like "Con-Air" bad.
We Gators know how to handle Ohio State.
What does little Kirk Herbstreet know about beating any SEC schools ever? 0-2 lifetime. No wonder he is such a bitter homer.
"Naysayers," you say?
Now that everyone can pay players it might be a bit tougher for SEC teams to dominate year after year.  (cough cough Alabama)
You have to grade the year on a curve.  There are no real A+ teams in the country.  This was arguably one of the worst Georgia teams of the Kirby Smart era at Georgia, certainly ahead of the 2016 team, but about even with the 2020 team.  A C+ Kirby Smart team, which got a gold star for effort. Because they only played a 1st quarter twice this year, and they still won the SEC. Weak sauce. But hey they did get to welcome to the SEC twice, so maybe a C+ with a gold stars AND one semi-smiley face?
For the cost of just a cup of coffee a day, you can help save an SEC team.
did someone say rebuild....OU Sooners have entered the chats
Gold
Why the heck is Indianapolis out here catching strays.... we dont deserve that.
Needed advice from N Champs not Budeyes. From team that beat Georgia and TA&M.
Step 1: Have your biggest game of the week kickoff at noon.
My Gators looking good in their bowl game.
Don't dunk on State. Lol they can't really help it! They're too busy trying to keep the flies away from their homecoming queen. They got bigger fish to fry!
The refs should come save them.
suck it SEC shorts.  Hail State!
Thank you for the Mike Bobo jab… as a Georgia fan, we have wanted him fired for a LONG time.
Five attempts in a row, yes, that one stings.
Miami thanks you 😂
"I think there might be some naysayers out here..." Oh boy.... 😝😂
FACT The last TWO YEARS the SEC has not been all that good. TONS OF HYPE but not showing up Do not give me this one year stuff
The SEC when they figure out that Texas spent more on a roster than Ohio State:
Got 4241 reasons why I dont care about Ohio State :P
The best qb in the sec is not going to Miami.
That was funny they did Alabama dirty😂
SEC Shorts, have YOU considered  entering the transfer portal?
Nico is mid  -🍊fan
You kept me laughing all season but you seriously need to get a Marty or McGee to make the closing comment because seeing Herbstreet at the end of each episode is nauseating. Ohio State ESPN game commentator is not what SEC fans want to hear or see. I don’t care if he does live in Nashville now. OSU NIL budget comment was spot on.
I'm going to work some overtime and donate $25 million to Alabama.... Roll Tide
I am shocked just SHOCKED that you guys didn't do one more Vandypimp episode for the road since they won their bowl game    Please DO MORE EPISODES FOR BASKETBALL SEASON!
At least texas won a couple games, tennessee and georgia, got bounced in their first game.
Thanks for the year of videos you created, SEC shorts crew.  I followed teams I never have  before, just so I could get the jokes and subtleties. Looked forward to the video drop each week.  It would have been nice for Vandypimp  to have one more appearance this year, but it was a trip getting to see him the times we did! The squirrel... not so much.
As the SEC realizes the expanded playoffs are showing them as an average conference, SEC Shorts has been improving all season.  We'll see you next year, unless you plan to do a 'watch party' video. 😁
GO BUCKS!!!!  A few more seasons like this and we can quickly fix our all-time record vs the SEC...   We also get to break in young Arch first game out the gate in The Shoe..
We need one more video featuring HOPE!
texas is still best of the worse
its going to be a long off season
Should have said ...HELLOOOO-H! Well with 7 teams in top 15 of top 25 polls in basketball, I think you guys are officially a basketball conference.
STFU Kirk Herbstreit. Two solid years of demanding SEC teams get in over better teams, only to see every one of them lose.
Beck was not one of the SEC’s best QBs! GA had to come from behind 7 times this year. A leading QB wouldn’t have had to deal with a deficit that often.
The SEC is dead. Long live the SEC.
As a graduate of THE Ohio State University, I can confirm that they never stfu about tradition and excellence even when their most famous coach was fired for punching another team's player on national TV.  *facepalm*
Time for the big five to fire the NCAA, then deal with NIL in a reasonable manner.
Someone whiffed on the opportunity to channel the ghost of Chris Farley as THE motivational speaker........
Gunner Stockon is going to be fantastic.  Hopefully Mike Bobo will get traded.
Y’all rock!!this is great!
Love SEC shorts they are brutally honest about the SEC
Don't forget completely overrated! Ohio State is perfect for that!
Step 2: Steal a coach away from a SEC team by promising him a better salary after he says he must rest cause the “game is too stressful”, thus rendering him a TRAITOR!!!!  Looking at you Urban Meyer!
So because the last 2 years a SEC team hasn’t won a natty even though 14 times out of the last 20 years it’s stayed in the SEC it’s spirally really
God I love the way she talks!
When Ohio State showed up that was easily the funniest moment I've seen on this channel
Don’t be throwing strays at MSU, at least we have a reason we suck  All I’m saying is, when we’re bad, the SEC is bad. Therefore you should send us all your recruits and money. For the good of the conference.
The SEC this year is actually worse than the early 90s Bills. At least they made it to the Super Bowl (championship game).
Nah, this wasn’t it.
Happy to hear Mike Bobo got made fun of.
Amazing Saban retires, and the whole SEC fell apart.
There is something truly wonderful listening to SEC honks whining away like spoiled little children.  They just barely broke 500 in their bowl games this year. As Nelson would say on the Simpson, HA HA 🤣
Saban needs to be on here
OSU accepted a measly $15.8 million from China and $7.7 million from Saudi Arabian sources.
The SEC was so weak this year
So basically if Carson never got injured Georgia wins their 3rd natty in 4 years.
texas university  accepted $380.5 million in foreign funds since 2013, including $25.3 million from China and $19.7 million from Saudi Arabia.
The Ohio State has lost to Michigan four (4) years in a row and counting.   Four years!!
"You couldn't score from the one yard line." I thought penn State was going to wake up in a coffin screaming.
*Texas has a higher NIL evaluation than OSU does.*
lol Carson beck is not the sec best qb 😂 not even remotely close
Those who favored NIL are now witnessing the consequences. Universities with billions In endowments and big donors will have an advantage in the long run if they have a top to bottom commitment to athletics. It’s a shame that Texas didn’t fare better in the semis. It’s even a bigger shame that no other SEC teams were there…or even supported the Longhorns. That’s a measure of how poorly this conference pulls together for member universities. Instead, you get teams whining about strength of schedule— which isn’t determined by the individual teams. Go complain to the NCAA and the SEC commissioner. As for new SEC teams being SEC ready: That’s just another way of saying we welcome your money, but we’re never going to root for your success. Bama and Bulldogs would rather see the SEC teams fail in the playoffs it they aren’t UGA or Alabama.
As a Miss. State fan, that stray in the opener was unnecessary. We will be back! RIP to the pirate 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
It just means more... losses 😂😂
As a Bama fan it’s been tough but thank goodness Milroe is leaving and we can get a QB that can read defense and actually throw the ball.
As an Ohio State fan, this may be my favorite SEC shorts episode of all time. Great job as always, guys!
It's a post Nick Saban world!
Love these. Except for Kirk at the end. Why is Mr. Big10 giving us the outro?
Can we get our report cards please go gators
I was expecting Matt Foley to say if the SEC doesn’t win next season they’d live in a van down by the river.
Really?  Using "... early 90's Buffalo Bills" as the symbol of excellence??????  You might want to rethink that one LOL
dang! they really did State dirty!
Thought Hope was coming out as the motivational speaker.
😂😂 Great stuff.
Awesome! 😂 Everyone does a great job! I always look forward to watching this! It’s so funny! 😂
Ummmm....the best quarterback is at LSU.
Tennessee had me screaming!
This new girl ain't it
Hey, hey, HEY!  The "$5 Bits of Broken Chair" trophy is serious business.
ROLL TIDE...We need to spend some money
Arkansas won a meaningless bowl game but now suddenly with the rest of the conference's performance seems a bit bigger than it was
“I thought there might be some naysayers in there” 😂😂 LANK!
SEC is now a basketball conference.
I was hoping the motivational speakers would be Michigan and NIU to "show them how it's done"
Love your videos! Have shared many of these with my fellow Buckeye & BIG fans. Can't waith till next years videos, GO BUCKS!!!
Tennessee's hair is on point
Didn't lie this is a dark year for the league 🤔
With the NIL in place I believe that other schools have a better advantage outside the SEC. The SEC just can't compete monetarily when it comes to attracting top tier, blue chip athletes.
Please make on for Vanderbilt winning the bowl game! ⚓️⬇️🖤💛
I'm assuming this will be the last one of these of the year which that seems strange to say but I will miss these on Monday's
Needed an appearance from Lane Kiffin stuntin' for beating  Duke and talking about how great the SEC is.
Tennessee's hair.   😆🤣
🤣
You looks at what Bowers and Lad are doing in the NFL and you realize the talent you lost on offense last year cant easily be replaced.  Those guys were incredible and made Bobo and Beck look better than they actually are.
We need college basketball SEC shorts just based on how that’s been going for the SEC lately.
The skit was great, but my entire focus was who poorly wired that Logitech Conference Room camera.  Rookie QB mistakes right there.
Go BUCKS
Eh. No worries. Everything will be fine.
2:46 scared tf outta me 😢
Miss State gut punch *tears*
meh
Can we have a hump day  Wednesday, surprise? Regina has to give out grades!
This is funny but people do know that Texas spent more on NIL than Ohio St, right?
Has Hope been replaced by Acceptance?  I say No!
Your best qb is a red shirt sophomore with legacy ties.
Herbstreit really like the OSU part.
when did yall hire the Hawk Tuah girl? 😂
I assume the season grades will still be coming out but this was a great season!! (For SEC shorts ofc, not my team go cats!)
I was hoping the motivational speaker was going to be Vanderbilt 😂
Florida hasn't just beaten Ohio State in a national championship football game they beat them in a NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL GAME TOO!  FLORIDA 41 ohio state 14, FLORIDA 84 ohio state 75
Not one other sec fanbase wanted Texas to win that game.
They should had Florida walk in and Ohio State start having PSD!  Because I think everyone knows next season Florida is going to be the best in the SEC and probably the best team in the nation!
Sewers coming back...PRICELESS!!😂😂😂😂
Maybe wishful gossip, but Bobo may be on the way out at Georgia.
SEC Shorts never disappoints but as a TexasExes, let's look on the bright side of the coin...we beat Michigan at their house after they won the Natty and now we'll have the chance to beat OH HIGH HOE at their place next season after they win it all this year (and yes, they will beat ND). Go Archie 🤣
I year is not a streak.
These are big 10 actors
the little brown jug isn't werid, its because we don't trust other teams to not poison us.
Michigan fans punching air rn
How many times has Ohio choked on the supposed way to the top? Most conferences have one or at the most two competitive games i  a conference season!
Not since Sherman burned Atlanta down has the South seen such dismal times.😏
ok so I hope they do one more when Notre dame clowns  the Ohio State
Actually the SEC might have been down as far as the very top but as a whole, no conference was close.
Was thinking 90s bills or sum😂😂might be a naysayer out here!
You will show respect to the B1G's rivalry trophies!  If you don't, the next time one of your coaches picks a fight with Bielema, we'll let Bret eat him.
As an Ohio State fan, I've been waiting for this to drop all week. Lol😂  As an Ohio State fan, I appreciate the fact that Xichigan wasn't in the video... 🙁
What's the deal with the forced Southern accents?
Best one yet. 😂
Not your best work. Carson Beck the best QB in the conference??? Hopefully the finale is better than this.
This is tragic
Man, I hate Kirk Herbstreit!
Niko is not mid!! 😢
I take it all back. good on you guys convincing someone to spend money on a second skit in a row dunking on the SEC. It's all love. See you next year!
As a buckeye fan I loved this video and the pimp vandy beating bama. Sec is still a powerhouse conference
Best qb? I think Lagway is still at Florida
Step 2: play 2 top 20 teams per season. 😂
Y’all did deserve to get clowned by Bret Bielema 😂
As an ACC fan, I approve this message. Misery loves company. Welcome.
Maybe they need to have Alabama Jones come on and talk about integrity
😆 🤣 😂 Go Bucks!!!
I assure you, most of us Tennessee fans will agree Nico is in fact, very mid. Especially considering his price tag.
Next year, the Mississippi Squirrel Revival
Looking forward to the post-season bowl results recap special!
You lost me at our best QB is going to Miami.
Pay 20 million like Ohio State!
Can’t wait for the end of season grades!
I thought the comment about state was below the belt. The unfortunate loss of our beloved coach has had a profound effect on our football team as of late but to insinuate we shouldn’t be in the SEC was crass. I’m sure it’s funny to Ole Miss fans maybe that’s what y’all are.
Go IRISH ☘️
All I'm gonna say is this...ESPN got the Natty game they wanted.  😐
Thankfully LANK is gone.  Roll Tide!!
Texas NIL was more than OSUs 🥱
They should've hired Vanderbilt as the motivational speaker... or maybe Georgia St would've been better.
Could we please get rid of the horrible fake accent the blonde tries to use in every other video!?
Texas going eww at State when they needed 4 quarters to put them away lol
Come on nothing on us beating Georgia.
Roll Tide
The motivational speaker should have been Matt Foley!!!  It was a no brainer.....
Mississippi state catching strays
It's a lesson for all sec teams. Don't mess with the big 10, especially the Buckeyes 🤣
Should have brought in Michigan to scare Ohio
I am sure THE Ohio State Kirk Herbstreit is the happiest guy here!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ohio State as a motivational speaker. Sure......
B1G > SEC
Your motivational speaker is from OSU? They haven't won a title since 2014 and that appearance was allegedly bought and paid for by Medium 10 commissioner Jim Delaney. Here's to that drought continues and the Luckeyes lose next week.
What happened out there??😂😂
Alabama fan scared of “naysayers”? Oh man yall cooked
Best year best shows yet great job 👏
SEC is a basketball conference.
best QB is Jalen Jaxson and LeNorris
So if OSU would go 6-6 in the SEC, and they just beat up 2 of their best teams, what does that say about the conference as a whole? Also, hearing SEC fans complaining about players being paid is hilarious 😂.
I fell on the floor when the Ohio State guy showed up! Hilarious!!! 😂
Thank God Georgia didn’t play Ohio State. OSU would never shut up for the next 50 years about beating 3 SEC schools in the playoffs. Let’s go Notre Dame.
man, really bad video to end the year on :( was there a single actual joke in there at all?
Brian Kelly's version of LSU is still the best 8-4 team in the SEC. Kelly is 7-25 against top 25 teams lifetime. 😮
Damnit Nico🤣🤣
[The experience of being a Mississippi State fan] *exists* *catches strays left and right*
Getting a motivational speech from a team that lost to it's rival 4 years in a row?  🤔
Obviously we need more Hope next year!
I caught that naysayer double entendre.
Booo the Indy disrespect. Great spot for those games
shut up Herbstreit, OSU homer.
Ohio St giving advice..."just spend $20 million on your roster every year!" Man, why didnt we think of that???
All I know is, Big XII better have 2 bids next season.
The SEC is in free fall... the conference needs a new leader. It's in a very precarious situation now because Sankey and company are sitting still. If the Big 10 raids the ACC for the top schools it is OVER.
Nico *IS* mid.
So funny! Go Bucks!
We gonna be back next year SEC. Just had a few unlucky breaks this year
O-H
Also, ASU could have easily beaten your BIG 12 champion transplant who won your regular season title. SEC SUCKS!
Go Buckeyes!!!!
This episode is very similar to the motivational speech THE University  of Michigan gave to a battered down, bullied, soft bodied ohio state man..and look at him now, carrying on that Michigan winning tradition
Beck has a Lamborghini, not a Ferrari, but I bet Miami will still have plenty of mechanics that can work on it 🤔
Great job by SEC Shorts in a down year for conference. Maybe should add basketball🏀
I hope Kentucky can bounce back to a bowl game again. We are working on the offensive line and qb position in the transfer portal and I hope we hit at both and have a good offense line and qb. If we do have that I think our run game will be deadly with Wilcox and we will get a bowl win and maybe 2 upsets so let’s bounce back cats from this fluke year I believe in mark stoops a after all he got us 2 10 win seasons and before that we had 0 in 41 years
Ouch!
I’ve been saying for years that the SEC circle jerk is only ever comparing themselves to themselves and are in for a rude awakening.  Love seeing this.
Died at the screen pass comment!!
it’s basketball season guys what r we doing
Speaking of trophies for every game us Kentucky fans and Tennessee fans had a rivalry with a beer barrel trophy I think but they stopped doing it and I don’t know why because Kentucky is known for making beer and whiskey so what’s the harm in the trophy. At least give us another trophy even though we lose to Tennessee a ton we are getting closer. This season we almost took the lead to have a chance at upsetting Tennessee but Brock got hurt and last season with Devin and ray Davis we lost by 7 points which isn’t too bad so hopefully this next year we win
Uh, he's only going there because of his girlfriend and so he can have more service options for his Ferrarri.    😂😂😂
Can we please do SEC Shorts for basketball this season? The conference is on fire
I think Texas and OU has brought the SEC down. Thanks SEC Shorts!
"SEC! SEC! SEC!"
Hilarious.....great job guys.
It’s the first bad year lol if it happens again and again then I’ll stress lol
That was hysterical. When OSU popped up and they all fell down. I was rolling. Perfect ending to a forgettable season.
I thought Swaggerbilt was going the be the motivational speaker.
I’m a Kentucky fan but maybe this was expected because we only had 1 sec win and Georgia beat us by 1 point and Tennessee was about to lose the lead on a great Kentucky drive before Brock got hurt so even though we were the worst sec team this year the best teams got pretty close to Kentucky in almost losing sometimes which might have been foreshadowing
At least Saban saw it coming and got out at the right time to preserve his legacy. CFB will never be the same after "pay for play".
SEC Shorts, y'all rock! ❤😂 Peace 🤘 🍻 💨
Hey! Gunner Stockton is awesome!
At least we made it to the playoffs!
The SEC is absolutely the bacon of college football
Loved the early 90’s buffalo bills 😂😂😂😂.  Maybe this year ? We hope. And Alabama at the window looking in. Awesome
MIZ!!!
Saban took the SEC's mojo with him. 😂😂
As a longtime suffering Illini fan, I never thought I would see or hear a reference to our program in the SEC Shorts.  The comment about Bret Bielema in this short makes us somewhat relevant again.  I was also glad Illinois never appeared in any of the shorts featuring D1 teams that lived in the "worst programs" basement with such programs as UMass, Kansas, Ohio, Vandy, etc.
New petition to have them do ALL conference shorts. Because these are gold, would love to see how they handle the others
Democrats all need motivation 😂😂😂😂
Great season!  The vids were great.  Ready for next year.
Never forget Texas came in and not only played for your championship, but outlasted the other 2 SEC schools in the playoff…in year one!  As I said all season long, we’re not in this conference with you, you’re in this with us! 🤘🏼🤨🤘🏼
Is this the last skit for the season? I would've liked one to celebrate the wins. Florida and Vanderbilt beating former SEC schools Tulane and GA Tech deserves some fun trash talk.
Sec meme sec meme.  Haha
ENOUGH ‼️ 🤣
The Texas NIL is bigger than OSU's this year but who's counting.
Ohio State? Oh my that hurts. 😢
The playoff SEC teams should change their name to Michigan if they play Ohio St. Guaranteed win there 😂😂😂😂😂
I hope SEC Shorts does another year-end report card.  This year's would be brutal.  UK's may need to be at a KY biurbon distillery.
Lmao @ I think there might be some Naysayers out here.
Whichever team wins the title thensec fans will rin their mouth saying "Well, they won ot in a down year for the sec"
1:50 *Lamborghini
Can we please get rid of Kirk doing the close outs on these videos. The irony is palpable
1:06 Tbf, I'm also scared of Ohio State fans
Don't watch while eating...😅..n
Really needed to hear from Vanderbilt, because if I remember correctly, he WON his bowl game!
The mighty SEC must pay players more than when they had to do it under the table lol….NIL is leveling the playing field!!
0:19 - ‘the bacon of college football excellence’
I love how everyone dunks on Ohio State for their NIL roster, completely forgetting that in 2024 Texas is first in NIL, having spent 2 million more than Ohio State, and Georgia is third in NIL spending, only 2 million behind second place OSU.
They should do a video for only the SEC teams that WON a bowl game.
This "new" woman on SEC Shorts is pretty lame.  No offense, but Hannah Kuykendall (the one who plays "Hope" on SEC Shorts) is much, much better and these videos haven't been as good the past few weeks without her.
Unnecessary shade at my poor MSU bulldogs... at least we are true to the location aspect of the South Eastern Conference
Oh and I have the SNEAKING suspicion that the downfall of the SEC is going to be going on for the next few years! Only time will tell! But I have to say also this was the BEST SEASON for SEC Shorts in the 5 years I have subbed to the channel! I do have to ask why not do something for basketball?
"He's only going bc of his girlfriend" 😂😂😂
SEC game, down right now.   SEC Shorts game, never been higher!  Kirk Herbstreit is still a crying, bum, sycophant.
Elephants have long memories, just remember that.
As a buckeye, I enjoyed this.
Alabama at the end!🤣🤣🤣
LOL
I'm a Dawg....but this was funny!! Well done gang!!! 😂
Hahaha
0:35 An entire fanbase's frustration channeled into a single word.
Not the beacon of college football last year either. Michigan and Washington for godsakes. 😂
Having weird trophies for every rivalry is underrated awesome.  Also, y'all let Alabama off easy.
The motivational speaker should have been Michigan because they actually won a National Championship like… last year.  Plus “I’m not getting dunked on by a Neyland North and Sideline Interference.” 😂
I wish you would have gotten Coach Saban to come in and holler at everyone.  😂
"Screen passes...The latest breakthrough from the Mike Bobo school of offensive innovation" I'm 💀
LMMFAO WE TOOK IT ON THE CHIN THIS YEAR SEC, AND KUDOS TO BECK GOING TO THE U, if that boy dont PRACTICE SELFDISIPLINE, hes cooked in that place
Thank you guys for the time that yall put into these shorts for everyone to watch on Mondays. Let’s do it again next season 🏈🏈🏈
I’m honestly surprise there was a dig at 90’s Buffalo Bills but no dig at 90’s Nebraska?
Oregon's roster was $23 million. Texas was $22.2 million. Georgia's was $18.3. Somehow Ohio State gets to carry the NIL flag alone, but two of the three teams they bounced outspent them.
We'll just have to grit our teeth on this crow and get ready for next year🐊
Nope, did not come here for THE most hated, obnoxious school in the country. Hoping for better content next time.
I was expecting NDSU to show up once aOSU described the qualities that the SEC had asked for and attempted to replace them
Oh my gosh, that Helloooooooo! Got me good lol. The acting is always superb but the Ohio State University exuded that childlike excitement and proudness perfectly hahahaha.   I almost lost it at the “oKayyy” mockery hahahahaha. So freaking funny
Was hoping for a reboot of The Big Ten Show.
Hm. Well this is kind of annoying. If I went through the list of everything this episode got wrong, I'd probably just end up coming across as "triggered."  Oh well. I guess a disappointing end to the SEC's season deserves a disappointing end to SEC Shorts' season
1:41 “Step one: assemble a roster with an NIL fund the size of the GDP of a small country.” The IRONY is palpable.
Carson Beck was not one of the best QBs in the SEC….
SEC is just taking a break and giving the little guy conferences a chance while we focus on the basketball side quest
Get used to it folks. SEC era is over.   The portal and NIL have taken away the SEC's advantages like oversigning and bag men that the Bamas, LSUs, Auburns, UGAs, etc all thrived on for years. Now everyone can go buy a Cam Newton and add depth equally.
No Vanderpimp? Sad 😢
As a non sec fan, i really hope we all keep it up. I feel like the SEC might be on a revenge tour next year.
Just for the record, that NIL money was more for the players that had already been at OSU. Only 3 notable players transferred in and only 1 was extremely important to the success.
Anyone else notice the camera focus was constantly blurring in/out?
too soon
Well you guys got basketball this year
Should have had Michigan show up at the end to jumpscare Ohio State.
the naysayers at the end almost sent me to the ER LOOOL
I love these shorts, but at the same time, I don’t think there’s any more tiresome than the conversation of “what conference is better?” This is talk radio father at its finest.
State catching strays for no reason :(
MIZ
Mississippi State catching strays!
Love SEC shorts  Go Bucks!
As an OU fan, I think it's our fault actually. Everyone told us we better step it up if we're going to succeed in the SEC. We took a different approach. We're working to bring the SEC down to the level we're used to.
As a proud Florida Gators, I’m terrified of next season. I have no idea how it’s gonna go
Love it ❤
Texas... tough... Roadkill has thicker skin.
LETS GO IRISH!!!
It's funny the OSU character references Big10 trophy games and OSU doesn't have any meaningful trophy games
Mizzou is still a member. Eww
Loved the reaction when the OSU guy came in. And the games were great this year, but the real highlight was....VandyPimp!
Hopefully the do basketball
I'm a Buckeye girl, but I have been watching SEC shorts for years. Ya'll just get funnier & more creative every season. I absolutely LOVED Pimp Vandy!! I hope he makes an appearance next year.
SEC basketball is so good this year this channel should switch over to doing some basketball videos!
General Sherman President of LSU and Ohio native is happy
HOOKEM
90s Bills reference and an Ohio State appearance. My heart…
I'm good with hiring Ohio State. They have a rich history of losing to Clemson.
Watch them not win a Natty next season either
“step 1: assemble a roster with NIL money the size of a GDP from a small country” PLEAZE IM WHEEZING
Texas didn’t get beat down
Been enjoying this year's shorts regularly, tho I'm a Buckeyes fan. This just made for the most wondeful payoff. :) (Altho I would have loved it if Pimp Vandy could have snuck in somehow to poke at Georgia's struggles with Georgia Tech...)
I guess we are a basketball and baseball conference now
SEC gonna continue to struggle in the NIL era.  Just can't keep up with the pockets of Penn State, Ohio State, ND, Oregon, etc.  i think the entry criteria for the new BIG 10 schools was show us your NIL fund balance.
“Neyland North” was the worst thing Volunteer fans could have possibly come up with. O-H.
OSU as a motivational speaker had so many options for more jokes they didn't take advantage of.. still great season of shorts.
“Mississippi State is still a vested conference member “….OUCH LOL!
Don't worry NIL will solve all the SEC's problems 😉
I thought i got breaking news about Ewers for a moment there!
The best part is even SDS can see Bobo's play calling is terrible.
The fake southern accent is too much, nobody talks like "thayat"
This is great!!! But the play off skit from NORAD was the best.. I really thought Brutus was going to walk in at some point!! O-H.     sec sec sec, LOLZ
Even got the black goatee for OSU, didn’t need a prop either
Looking forward to baseball starting on Feb 14
Catch you next year guys...almost makes me want to see the SEC do well...almost
Why would Georgia be afraid of OSU? They've never beaten Georgia.
Have SO enjoyed the SEC Shorts. Especially their depiction of Vandy when they defeated Alabama.  I hope Willie Geist of Vandy got to see that.
No joke about OSU being the SEC's playoff whipping boy for 15 years?
Texas NIL....  22 Million.  So, yeah.
Notre Dame doesn't even get MENTIONED? man cmon
This may be your best season ever. Well done!  My only question is if many Vol fans believe their QB is mid-first round.
The old NIL and portal are catching up. It's going to be hard for any schools to have continuity now. You can't stockpile players anymore. BUT, the same rule applies to OSU, ND, and all those teams who are in it this year. They will also have a hard time keeping players. Depth is going to be difficult to keep for anyone. If you don't play you'll go where you willz
they did Alabama so dirty LMAO
I loved it --- SEC teams -- it'll be ok -- we all will rise again !!!
This one actually hurt to watch . Sad that the highlight of our year was the Vandy pimp .
🍀 ☘️  🍀
SOUTH BEND! New South!!!!!!!
The SEC is cooked
ND!
What happened ??????  Nick Saban retired.  In all fairness the SEC is still a LOT deeper than anyone else.
☘️
KING ARCHIBALD II
If only Michigan would have entered the room and osu squealed like a girl and ran out of the room to avoid ANOTHER beatdown.... That would have been the cherry on Top
Lamborghini not ferrari
Was Tennessee's hair just super rat-nested, or was that turf tangled up in it? Either way, as a fan of THE Ohio State University, I appreciate the visual thoroughness to the beat-down that was administered what seems like a year ago,
M I Z
The appearance of Alabama from the other side of the window was hilarious. Thanks SEC shorts for lots of laughs. The SEC may or may not improve next year, but I will still look forward to another great season of SEC shorts.
Wish Hope made an appearance
Osu has never beat UGA 🤣
"Sideline interference King" that's the first time I've been able to laugh since the Sugar Bowl. But hey - Go Dawgs!!!
As always SEC shorts comes through!!! As a vol fan it hurt but was absolutely hilarious to watch!!! 😂
“The bacon of college football eggcellence?”
When GA won back to back Ohio State was crying and blaming refs, these aren't sec players most of these actors are big10
Wish they did basketball content also.
and your best quarterbacks will win nattys in miami, too.
I figured step one was being born on 3rd base.
You should have chased away the motivational speaker by having somebody from Michigan show up.
LANK isn't gonna hit the same anymore!
Step 1 NIL money.. wasnt Texas NIL larger...? god i love these as a Buckeye
A fine line between laughing at oneself and hitting a nerve.
These videos always bring such happiness, and then Kirk shows up at the end and the depression returns.
I’m confused. UGA has a better recent track record than osu who still can’t win their rivalry game.
A team that lost 4 straight to a team they are too afraid to say the name of doesnt have any right to tell people to toughen up 😂 Its like a furry telling someone they are too weird
Ohio State being the motivational speaker after destroying Tennessee and then soundly beating Texas is wild
Was really hoping the motivational speaker was mizzou after beating Ohio state last year and another big 10 team in postseason this year… something something “here’s how to beat Ohio state”. Still great humor here though
The biggest winners in the SEC was the SEC Shorts crew. Thank you for helping us laugh all while learning to eat that humble pie when our team didn’t play like we hoped. As always, we cannot wait for next season.
I want Kirk's tag at the end to just become more and more unhinged and unrelated to the video it follows, as if he's trapped in a Sponsor Tag Read factory.
"The bacon of college football excellence"
Why do I hear about tOSU's $20M roster, but not Texas' $22M roster?
Absolutely brilliant! And hilarious.
'HELLOOOOOOO!' 'AHHHHHHHHH!'  GENIUS!
Great vid. Sad season. Now, I feel bad. Thanks.
Really, OSU can’t beat Michiiiiiigan for the last four years.   Also, F Mike Bobo!
Indiana lost on the road to the champion game participants....... And only them  Ergo, Indiana would have won the SEC
Ohio St. needs a motivational speaker that will help them beat Michigan.   "ay buddy, youse a buckeye"......what clowns
🗣️ B I G B I G B I G 🗣️
The last line, was a chefs kiss.
As always, best part of YouTube every week in the fall, and early winter of course.
It was a great year for the SEC .....   Shorts!
PLEASE clown on that clown we have as OC. Maybe Bobo the Clown will be fired.
There's always SEC basketball.
Funny that Texas ragged on GA for screen passes when that is the play that lost them the game to OSU.
Tennesse: "Happy to be of service" 😂
GO BUCKS! O-H!
I am an Ohio State Fan (and alumnus) and I approve of this message.
Brutal, funny and the bickering back and forth really makes them sound like the big screwed up family they are. Nice job
Silver Lining: Florida broke their losing season streak.
Hilarious as always!!
NIL narrative for Ohio State is a little played out at this point.  The estimated "20 million" wasn't to bring in new recruits, most went to seniors on the team, and it wasn't even the biggest number out there this season.  Gotta have excuses somewhere I guess.
This one hurt a bit, but still completely hilarious! Keep up the good work folks!
Tennessee's hair had me dying
SOME NAYSAYERS was hilarious
Why do I expect to see Pimp Vandy at the end of each episode now?
The only thing that improves this is if notre dame beats ohio state 😂
How tough was it to keep Josh out of the 90s Tennessee puffy Starter coat for this skit? XD
Your best season yet SEC shorts! As a Buckeyes fan, I have no doubt the SEC will back strong (but it has been fun watching people from the other conferences make fun of the SEC this year).
This is wrong. Georgia won the National Championship in 2023. So how could the SEC NOT have made it to the National Championship in 2 Years if Georgia was National Champion last season
More time for ‘The Big 10 Show’ or ‘Notre Dame Suck Club’..lol. Appreciated the season.
Thank you SEC SHORTS for closing out the season. Been looking for y'all to respond for the last two or three weeks to the "Final Destinations" of Texas, GA, & TN.
We got a great transfer quarterback in John Mateer at Okie
Bobo and clown were words spoken in under 10 seconds
How the heck can you do this clip without involving the team that DID beat THE TOUGH OSU (4 times in a row) and Bama (twice in one year) ???
No Mizzou punchline. Man the writing is falling off the tracks.
SEC is starting to not mean anything now that the Big10 is THE Super Power
Great job
it just means more in lower case letters this year. (in your country slang draw)
As a Bama fan, the Naysayers joke was on point.
great content as always... love it..
was 'sortof' rooting for Texas to see how the 'schools' would accept if Texas was a real SEC school or not
Except Texas had MORE NIL money spent.  $22.2M  and Oregon had $23M spent.  And who beat them both?  HAHAHAHAHAHHA
Don't know which one was better, Ohio State appearing as the motivational speaker or the transfer portal jab at the end. Great work guys, such a shame that hope didn't make an appearance though.
LOL these are awesome. As an OSU grad that got tired of the "can't beat the SEC memes" (although we beat the great Saban in the past before winning it all) I really enjoy these.
Hey! Mississippi State is great at baseball! That matters right?
NIL and transfer portal have raped SEC dominance. Se la viv
I was thinking the motivational speaker would be Hope, but seeing the OSU shirt was even better
missed opportunity to have Michigan randomly show up and scare Ohio State.
Imagine pining for Nick Saban to be the new NCAA commissioner after listening to him plea during the playoff selection show without explicitly saying it, that the playoffs need more SEC teams, then watching the SEC reps this season get absolutely steamrolled.
Thanks for weekly Collegiate Jocularity everyone!  The season provided for some really hilarious moments.  Is Ewers really coming back?
As a OU fan, We want to thank the SEC for sucking this year. Just makes OU look even worse. lol
Painfully unfunny as always
The naysayers Alabama reference might only be for a few people
Beck was not the best qb in the sec stop it you lose all credibility saying such nonsense
Heh, heh Herbie should have given a wry little smile and say under his breath "The Ohio State."   (and no, I didn't go there)   Good stuff,  SEC able to laugh at themselves.
Quick and often ignored fact: Texas had a larger NIL budget.
Cant wait for SEC baseball season!  Basketball is doing well
Considering we know what naysayer was a placeholder for I'm torn about that joke 😭😂
SEC! SEC!! SEC!!  Loved watching the SEC get destroyed. That said, having this sense of humor about it is amazing. Well done all season.  Go Bucks!
Yes yes yes !!!!!
Brutal. Did that come out of the Rosemont (IL) office?
Miami can have Carson Beck, no love lost there. Take him. We have had enough of him. The dude looks like Timmy from South Park. The only difference is that Timmy from South Park brings some energy with him wherever he goes.
2:36 "Five! It was Five!" Is a great line, but missed opportunity to come back with "How many Overtimes did you need to 'beat' Georgia Tech again?"
I was really hoping for matt Foley to be that motivational speaker.
Can’t wait for next week, whether it is the Big Ten Show or a notre dame sketch
An all-Yankee National Championship in the South! Wow! General Lee is rolling over in the grave. Go Bucks.👍😎
Did she say, "..the bacon of football eggcellence" ?
"THE"
Alabama on the outside lookin in. How the tides haves changed
Maybe just maybe, had Vanderbilt pimpling a little, they won their bowl game.
Did Ohio state forgot about 2020 already? 😂
The jump scare of bringing in THE Ohio State 😂
"Our best quarterback is going to miami" Is Carson Beck even in that conversation? I'm sincerely asking.
This saddens me, makes me mad but funny at the same time. Just a range of emotions going on here.😂😡☹️🤣🤬😟😳
The civil war ended in 1865, relax, its a game played by children.
You better start winning these playoff games or else you're going to be living IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!
I have been waiting for SEC shorts video on the playoff results.  lol
Vanderpimp deserves at least one more appearance for winning their bowl game.
"Sideline Interference King!" - Great one!
"I think there might be some naysayers out here" is a joke I would not have guessed would make it into a video.  Wow.
Where is Bama?
This is Lane Kiffin's fault. Ole Miss had the highest potential of any SEC team this season, and it was squandered
Looking at the last 24 years performance I think we're doing fine. We'll let the cow farmers who kick off at 11am every Saturday have one now and then. Bless their hearts.
No Vandy?
This was a bad year for the SEC. The B1G has constantly been dissed by them and they took it personally.
Who's the girl in the suit? She's been one of the best parts of the SEC Shorts this season
Ho hum......you've made better efforts but overall it's been your best year.  Look forward to next year.
Yeah, a team that hasn't won in 10 years lecturing us. 😏  Also, not down on Gunnar Stockton. I wanna see how he does when receivers can actually catch the ball. Holy cow, can we not drop a pass, guys? Seriously? Led the nation in drops. Get it together.
The SEC's domination is over. Y'all illegally paid your players via fake charities for decades and now with NIL, you're not going to be much better than the ACC. The B1G will dominate you forever.
Anyone know who that actress, not Tennessee, is?  She's not on the website.
as an OSU grad i approve of the SEC downfall
I thought bringing Ohio state to be the motivational speaker 😂😂😂this one was too good! Go SEC shorts! WPS!!
Just like that, the CFP became SEC Free.
OSU still cant beat Michigan, just like Bama. GO BLUE!!!!
"But at least we have SEC shorts and Matt Mitchell" is the new battle cry of the SEC
Great season guys!
I have thoroughly enjoyed all of  the SEC shorts this year. Pimp Vandy, the sprinkling of out of conference teams, all the unexpected hospital visits from anticipated cupcakes... absolutely great work! I'm not a huge fan of the NIL overall, but it has evened the playing field by a lot. The 12 team playoff also made it so you still have to have a deep roster to handle the late season injuries too. I wonder how the players are feeling with all these changes (besides rich). Lastly - I certainly hope they don't change the number of years eligibility...
How many tries did you have from the 1 yard line? Ouch 🤣
I'm here for the $EC's pain. Was hoping for an appearance from pimp Vandy.
Looks like SEC Shorts is going into the Transfer Portal...
Tennessee 😂😂
Great episode!
I love the shot at Bobo 😂
Tennessee, Beat downs? I freaking died😭🤣☠️
The last time the SEC didn't make it to the natty game two years in a row resulted in Florida dominating. I'm here for it.
O-H
Still love SEC Shorts but College football is now worse than the NFL. NIL and the Portal SUCK! There's no more coaching, only herding a bunch of temps around.
😂😂Amazing!! One of your best
0:50  What was the "dig" at Mississippi State about?  "... is still a vested member."
UGA fan here. Gunner Stockton seems like he is legitimately a great quarterback. I think he doesn't have the practice with being under pressure and the O-line just miserably failing is the real issue. If he was given just one more second on most of these plays we would've done a lot better.
Miss st catching strays 😂
SEC Shorts. Thank you for anothet great year. From vandy and The Win Column Lady getting together. From Hope making appearances again. To Pimp Vandy. And Alabama getting snubbed by the Playoffs and that dang Lane Kiffen. Thanks for another good year and cant wait for next year. Love from the Big Ten Fight On Trojans the Real USC 😂
I could not understand what they were saying about Nico and had to turn on close caption.  He is "mid".  I guess I am not in touch with modern lingo anymore lol.
Not as great a season as hoped for on the field, but definitely a great season for SEC Shorts !!! Thanks yall for a wonderful year of laughs !  RTR
OMG!!!  I almost died!!!
The new girl is terrible
SEC, we deserved every bit of this. The worst part is no more SEC shorts until next season.  Geaux Tigers 😂
Texas at the goal line. 😂
The irony wasn't lost on me, seeing Ohio St being played by an African American, 😅 talking to Colleges from the SEC, being played by White people. 😅😂😅😂😅
I am a Vols fan but I laughed really hard when Ohio State showed up as motivational speaker and they all hid.
Kirk should have clowned them again and said "Tough break, you'll get em next......never mind"
We’re a basketball conference now.
Turns out Indiana had a harder schedule than yall thought.
Maybe you guys can shift to basketball season now. As the SEC is a basketball conference now. (And please dunk on Cal, a lot)
Still don't know why Sark called a pitch
😂😂 RTR!
Cannot wait for report cards
I’m starting to think that all those Alabama players transferred not because Saban retired but, because they knew Jalen Milroe was still gonna be the starting QB next year.
Come on, we need Vandy love
Wish the teams that won got some representation!
😂😂😂
As a Tennessee fan, this was absolutely hysterical 🤣🤣 I knew that motivational speaker was gonna be in an OSU shirt the second I saw the title of the video.
That's a gooden! Go Dawgs!!
Thank You for Mentioning MICHIGAN indirectly. The Big 10 sends their Regards. The Cast was funny as well.
Nice job!
The SEC was highly overrated....
Michigan owns Ohio State who smoked two of these teams.  Plus Michigan beat Bama twice in a calendar year.
As a UGA fan, this was great! Funny as ever! I look forward to each and every one.
SEC had a lot of Good Teams but no elite teams this year.. The Alabama Ending had some legit Truth to it.. Always enjoy the new girl. She was a Feature today and did well.
I was half expecting Matt Foley, motivational speaker  🤣   in a van down by the river....
Should rename this channel to SEC Sucks.  Accurate description of the channel.
0:20 I thought she said "the bacon of college football eggsellence" and was like weird metaphor but let em cook
Love it. Great Closing skit SEC shorts!
0:59 my very first thought was "who? Ohio state?" Lmao
The Mike Bobo school of screen passes! LMAO! That was brutal but true!
Poor Mississippi State
On the bright side, we have 9 teams in the top 25 in men’s basketball. We’re a basketball conference and a baseball conference.
While this season wasn’t the SEC’s strongest, I think there’s no doubt that the squad at SEC Shorts had its best season possible. So many incredible videos this year alone!
Biggest thing in this that upset me is having a stupid Ohio St guy at the end
I wanted vandy pimp to cheer them all up
Jesus I swear they need to delete the WR Screen passes from the playbook
Lost it at the Mike Bobo school of offensive innovation
Oh I wish a jab at how Ewers is the only OSU recruit to ever beat Michigan during the last 4yrs was thrown out there. Its been my goto when their fans started to attack, lol. Hook 'EM!
Thanks, SEC SHORTS, for another great season.
As a ga fan the Bobo joke was on point.
It just means more
“Quinn Ewers announces he’s coming back to Texas for another year!” Killed me
😂
Always love the content yall! Please dont stop
The long, cold off-season will be where the SEC enters its Aaron Rodgers phase of darkness.
Fixed just like 2013.
How to be a champion for OSU……Try beating Michigan post Covid
“Best” QB to Miami…!? that is hilarious.
Been waiting for this masterpiece!! It delivered
Bills really catching a stray here 😭😭😅
3rd comment!! Love y'all at SEC Shorts!!
Big 10 shorts cowards lol!
We got Nico, Arch and Gunner next year!!!
this conference has lost all credibility until further notice. and don’t bring up basketball and baseball, i know. the national audience and media does not care about basketball until March and never bring up baseball. football pays the bills
ITS ABOUT TIME!!!!! I WAS WAITING FOR THIS  Edit: after watching.... hey glad we could be of some help.. bless yalls heart! ❤️
HORNS DOWN BABY
first
