A metronome?
کیوان Kivan نام کهکشانی توست❤
Legend
You answered a question that was never asked🖖
ive been following u for those 8 years
a piston engine produced uneven power - did this guy think he re invented the (fly)wheel?
Amazing, great job,.sir
Well he discoved very efficient bike drivetrain
Governor ❤
...the problem is you want to be a machine... your crazy laughter in the beginning shows the direction into you are drifting...
Why you wanna sound like another robot 🤖 we have auto tune and drum machines already
Wundervoll ^^
Escapement mechanisms used in clocks have been around since the 1300s...
J Dilla is spinning in his grave; bravo, sir
it's a very old technologie from coal age... :-)
it has been a long time you maniac, but you finally did it
Looks dangerous af in the end.
this machine will employ millions of cats
Idk if they said so but those people working seems very focused on work. I hope they pay them well.
Bro made a mechanical capacitor
thats awesome!!!
Its nice to see that you're still improving your project. Its neat when you see a video about something interesting and then think 'man, I wonder how that project went' and then you find more recent videos where everything is improved. There was 1 Youtuber who was building a flying machine years ago with 2-stroke engines and having trouble. Years later I see that he finally build a flying machine.
Seems like you have rediscovered what steam engineers found out 150 years ago
you are the guy who first inspired me to make music as a younglin
Are you sure that’s a human?
sooo how many decades till its done
Never heard him speak before, he low-key sounds like the fish from American Dad
Determination!🎉  We all wants to hear the new perfect marble machine to play music ❤❤❤
That smile says it all... the sweet taste of finally seeing the fruit out of his long trail and error.
Dayum marble machine man is back
as soon as i saw the giant machine the song went in my head
It’s not constant power. It’s constant speed. If the resistance torque changes would the speed change?
When you have a great idea like 10 years ago BUT THEN YOU NEVER STOP PERFECTING IT
Governer and  flywheel are used in cars to to stabilise engine output
It’s a krugelflank or whatever
i mean.. the pause is just as important as the notes, you get a more natural flow when humans play which is what you'd want... but i understand where you're going with this as well.
Hasn't this issue been solved for many decades, if not centuries, with mechanisms? Like even beyond a pendulum, I'm pretty sure there were mechanisms for temporally evening out power or RPM
0:01 That legit mad scientist laugh!
How can it power a boat
tell me you have autism without telling me you have autism
Dude just use the manifold from a player piano. This issue was solved 130 years ago.
I've been following you since 2015. At the time, I was actively promoting my Ugears mechanical plywood model project. That's why your inventions resonate with me. Solving the problem of uniform motion is an eternal challenge.
Clock？
Looks like Igor fron Frankenstein 😅😅
This is what happens when you spend your RPG character skill points into Engineering and Music :D
ТММ в помощь))
could have told ya before..8 years? or u mean 8 days?
oldschool internet bros REUNITE
My brother loves your machine! He watch all your videos again and again last year😊
Your mom wanted you to be a musician and your dad wanted you to be an engineer..Here we have Martin Molin
But there's magic in imperfection too...
Sudocrem
Impressive!
so happy of this success <3
We gonna get GTA6 before MMX2
Next time, ask to me.
Scientists: it's not music theory it's easy Musician: it's not rocket science it's easy  Meanwhile this guy:
Great job! This is an invention that unfortunately 680 000  palestinians (of whom 380 000 children under 5) will never see because they were genocided by Israel
Du bist ein Genie. Respekt.👍😎
I wish I had 1/10 of your intellect and creativeness you have in your little toe.
You would appreciate old giant engines
That laugh in the beginning 😂 so diabolic
Best! You are not alone bro, Im working now on similar issue
Bro all this was invented 2000 years ago just about
CONGRATSSS!
But but but, what I liked was the connection to variation due to imperfection... but i do love your ingenuity and indomitable spirit!!!
*maniacal mad scientist laughter intensifies*
I used to watch you when i was younger, the marble music machine was my number one addiction.
The definition of a unless endeavor
Can it generate a rhythmic pattern like samba or pagode (Brazilian music) or even flamenco?
That laugh at the beginning, I thought he had created some dark, evil, wizardry sh*t
Congrats
Imo you have just taken the fun of the human element out
I had almost forgotten about this guy
Just put a capacitor, duh
Chatgpt avec un bonnet
There's nothing more Swedish than spending thousands of hours trying to solve a problem no one has.
Really cool
저거 언제까지 우려먹는거예요
"Hahahaha! Yes!" The delightful mad scientist character of this moment.
у него нос то че как у петровича
отвязался от эгрегора или торчинский
Please keep the hand crank, though. Fix it how you need to, but the visual of you cranking the machine is just so pleasing to watch
why waste so much time and efford why not rather then using your self why not use something that is a even output power that runs it ad a constand rpm problem solved xD with out alot of the rest like small elektro engine spining the wheel could done this in seconds :P
meanwhile clocks exist
That laugh and "yes"... I know that exact feeling... Every time I test the next update/prototype/iteration of my amplifiers and it works how I want it to, I do the same (laugh may be a bit more maniacal and the "yessss" a bit more Calrkson-esque, but that feeling of sweet victory is the same)
Idk why but I was waiting for the crab rave to play
"What do you do for a living?" "I'm a mechanichal musician!"
pretending it isnt for a sex machine
He is a real genius, wow this is perfection
I can't unhear the music, such a lovely music
From watching your videos about the sequel machines to your first one, I'm expecting that by now, you've already discarded this "perfect" solution for a perfecter one.
i’m so glad you decided to use a centrifugal governor. they’re one of my favourite little tricks in mechanisms that we don’t often get to see
Now just make it electric, massive, efficient, and cheap and you solved an issue with the electrical grid!
I think it's gonna take eight more years. Nuclear fusion, flying cars, jetpacks for all, world peace. Eight more years.
Wintergatan my beloved
from 18 century tech to 19 century tech creating music, very interesting
gotta say i lean towards the human feel. as long as the mechanical parts follow your hand-made tempo in unison, you can push & pull against the tempo for emotion and groove!
Inertia surely helps to smooth motion. Lower impulses lead to smoother travel. I like it 👍
I love flywheels so much
The thing is  The human tempo is what gives it its soul. I remember watching this it awe
He's probably already scrapped it by now in place of something else.
Remind me of an elongated Version of my r6
Congratulations, you just removed the human factor off an instrument. Now you got an analog synth 😅
there is no way youtube revenue pays for such a project
this seems like a  CTV(continuous variable transition) which are VERY COOL.
I might add that you would see better results if you adjust the inverse combobulator 31.3 degrees towards true north  You're welcome
Ya but the human element is what makes it fun 💁‍♀️
The "human" timing being all over the place only tells me one thing. You are not now or ever was a successful musician, and most certainly never a percussionist. Next time, try getting a professional before declaring all humans incompetent.
It's impressive, he discovered the bicycle with a nail in one wheel, wonderful.
wow this guy is still building a marble machine
You looked like a happy cat, making biscuits in the intro 😂 Glad your back.  Genius level music making
Why does that sound like the drum intro to Dance Dance by Fall Out Boy
So no talent needed,,, idiot proof like a beat counter
I think your dedication to your vision and dream is second to none. The world needs more like you.  Congratulations on your outstanding accomplishments! Dream on!
Cool, we're getting old together 😂😅
Brother youre alive and still on this! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The victory laugh human companion over centuries of invention!!! We bow in awe 😊
:D
So this is like kalman filter but with gears
Awesome! Congratulations! =)
Dear Martin, I am so glad of your progress, solving that with gravity is just the genious we all want to see more. Your work into the marble machine is so precious for me, you focus on solutions, fight every Problem step by step and the marble machine 2 was already top tear engineering, just look at its nearly flawless mechanics.  I am sure, the next version will be the masterwork everyone will appreciate the way it is in real. Im on fire to see some songs on that master mechanic art
8 years? Cmon man
When you have too much time on your hands
That’s just like my grandmother’s sewing machine from when I was a child. She would press the floor pedal and it would spin according to how fast she kept pressing her foot.
Oh holy hell its the GUY and hes BACK hot damn
But that change from humans not being perfect is what makes the music amazing, the prefect tempo just makes it like if it was a machine or even a computer...
I’m so happy you are still working on this. I’ve enjoyed your videos since the first marble machine i saw, I’m excited to see where your journey takes you!
Ah yes, the doohickey is working perfectly.
The power/unstable core grind is so atrocious that me having got a full time job recently completely disables my ability to play any new Destiny. I can still play old dungeons and such, but they give me nothing useful anymore, and trying to power grind with just an hour each day feels pointless
Never thought victory tastes so tight
Pretty badass
Oh right i remember this, old
That looks insanely complex so that’s definitely a huge accomplishment
What is this? I remember seeing that old wood video years ago
musician becomes an engineer to discover how to turn AC into DC so he doesn't lose his marbles
Like a cat making biscuits!😂
I think car engines work in the same way. The combustion isn’t very consistent either
I'm surprised you didn't use a couple centrifugal clutches and flywheels for a lot less stages. A CVT setup with pulleys tuned to maintain an approximate RPM's based on the weights on both. One for going too high and one for going to low from an approximate "exact" RPM, but then this thing works for sure!
You can’t play Chopin with that… perfection is like the Many Faced God
Love the Citroën gears and the Watt governer.  Some of my favourite engineers' work here, I hope there are build videos for this, going to have to find them now.
I love this for you and everyone who will get to hear
Taking computer science, trying to understand this. It's basically just a mechanical capacitor? Either way, it's super cool
I have no idea what you have done here
Proud of you man! 😊
8 years from now...  I Finally Did It! After 16 years I found the PERFECT GEAR
Looks like we can be the Flintstones
but the human element was the best part....
some ppl say that computers killed music because is too perfect and the human error give it life bla bla bla... and you literally went against all that purist bs and i like it so much
but i like the human error.
Not quite my tempo
YOU! YOU ARE THE MARBLE MUSIC MACHINE GUY!!
Heck yeah! Let's go!
Every few years I come back to this channel and think "HE'S STILL DESIGNING THE NEXT ONE?!?!?" but at this point its just a ritual to check on a man with the drive and vision to achieve his mechanical musical dream. Hope to see you again next year!
Neutrogena taping 😊😊
The amazing thing is the dedication you have shown to this project.  8 years is not an insignificant amount of time.
Pshhhh
Thought it was a google box
Congratulations you magical mech musician 🎉 I watch your original machine video to this very day 🥳 Thank you for not giving up 🫂
Communism just needs constant "pre"-methodical rhythm
Im too high for this...
No, your original machine and song is one of the greatest songs ever.
Oh, you mean a capacitor 😊
Might I just say that you have a beautiful mind. 💫🙌
Now, in the USA we shall put prisoners with life sentences to convert cheap food into electricity by being put to work on a bicycle to exercise.
bro made quantization from the 1500s
I mean, that's super cool. but part of the charm was that there was still a human element of the marble machine. If you're looking for absolute perfection, you might as well just let a computer control everything.
This has been years man where’d you go
this is amazing
yes thank you
if you haven’t already try attaching it to a wind turbine
congrats
Pianolas solved this for music roles over a century ago?
Bruh
Hell yeah dude
Rightttttt
He made a googlebox
I like his mad scientist laugh😂
I can’t imagine having this much free time.
This is borderline unhinged and I love everything about it
Cool brain, bro 😊
Some parent is very confused by the slapping sound coming out of his son's room
You telling me. Since I first heard your amazing first contraption. You have just now. Designed a new better.... PEAK. I love this culmination of effort and discipline for you.
Great.. you made acoustic music sound digitally created..... 🙄
"Smooths" out the torque.
........what?
Isto seria semelhante ao mecanismo dos relogios de pendulo?
Honestly, I have to say I don't mind the uneven tempo. That adds personality lol
It sounds like you taped a card on a fan or somthing
Bout damn time! Im sorry. Im in a bad mood right now and I have quite the short tempo. Hopefully i will beat this, but it just feels like I'm trapped in some sort of snare. Metronome.
Wintergatan X Aurora
Woah. Congrats. Amazing
Bro made the ultimate power generator thingamajiggy
You did it before you lost your marbles. lol. So glad to hear and can't wait for assembly videos.
Flywheel and GOV😂
A little bit of herb with rick and morty solves everything
The governor is probably necessary at some point in the system but I hope it's controlling a variable transmission and not resisting your eratic input,  that would be wasteful.
It's good to have a healthy level of skepticism. 😊
Wuuuuu!
So long proces, literal wase of life AND for what!? 🤦🏻🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♂️.
A man refers to himself as “the human”
No idea what I just watched. Are you...ok in the head?
As an average guy, I find this truly remarkable. Grateful for people with this level of intelligence and commitment.
Use a bike; it's even, smooth and easy
Man I can't wait for it to finally be completed 💝
All the best to you man, still holding on to this project.
-this is why we have robotics now brociff Stalin
A solution would be the human input charges a spring of sorts and That powers the mechanism which is powered but kept in time like a watch
I feel like robotic tightness takes the art and humanity out of it.
He's a mad man! A mad man!!! 🙀
I saw this guy deep in the forest about 10 years ago, zooted out of my mind.
I absolutely love that you do what you do. Thanks ❤
Mechanical autotune
Excellent!
Blue human tempo is what makes music unique, emotional, and human. I'll never understand how people prefer the soulless machine tempo over human
Pops up in my feed: It's the demon from Insidious in its human disguise...well played - getting out of the Further and all.
Or you just don't have good rhythm feel, but none the less overcoming that with engineering is arguably more impressive! You smart af
Dude I remember watching the first video of yours that I found when I was in Middle school.  You are so badass for staying on the path and in the zone.
It actually reminds me of a trebuchet design from a pumpkin chucking competition I saw over a decade ago. The trebuchet was bizarrely short, and had a pair of horizontal platforms that rolled over each other to build up the momentum.  Your hand pumps brought it to mind. Nice machine!
The kackle of victory driven by madness born of obsession.  I feel the guilt of enjoying this moment without paying my dues of attention.  Congratulations Wintergarten, it lives.
It's called feeling.
Any interest in production of electricity with that? You seem to have a great mind for energy efficiency.
and at end u can make Penutbutter right?
Nice 3d prints
He didn't invent a mechanical anything.     He took previously invented devices,  and arranged them in a novel way.   Saying he invented this is like saying Henry Ford invented the axle.  And on top of that most things in his design have an analog in a stationery steam engine.   The weight driven drive is the only piece that isn't in a stationery steam engine( reciprocating motion to rotary motion, flywheel, and ball governor) Only took him 8 years to "reinvent "(copy) a mid 1800's device.     I also think he will find that a flyball governor will run at a set speed for a specific load.  Change the load, and the speed changes too.   The governor will reduce the effect of the load on the speed, but it can not keep exactly the same speed on 2 different loads.  Muting and unmuting sections of his machine will have the effect of changing the tempo.  How much ,depends on how he specifically designs the machine.  It may not be noticeable,  but it will be there   I give him credit for sticking with his dream, and I did at one time follow his work regularly.   Just got tired of getting excited when he "Finally figured it out! " so many times.
i was sometimes wondering what this guy was up to. now i know. And he figuered out this part so more crazy things to come soon. love it
Someone crowd source this man a drum machine!.😂
MECHANICAL FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER!!!
6 months after vid
Nice
Brilliant....
Congratulations on re-inventing the governor, which was first invented like 400 years ago? "Centrifugal governors were invented by Christiaan Huygens and used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills in the 17th century."  ... and it "only" took eight years to reinvent it. Wow.
You’ve got an extraordinary engineering mindset. No problem is going to get away from you without you putting massive amounts of time and consideration into a feasible solution. 🎉
So it’s literally like physical real-time quantization? That’s insane
mORE pOWER!
This is genius level stuff. Wow
Black people can't do this.
Wonderful. Love your work.
They have a thing called AI know soooo much easier instead of wasting your time with 1930s technology.
Martin now: "After 8 years i found the perfect gears!" Martin in 20 years: " After 28 years i found the perfect gears!"
He did it… the crazy SOB actually did it!
At Long Last! We Shall Have Marble Machine X 😆❤🎉
Needs to be operated by cats.
In "The problem is that the human power output is very uneven" part of the video you remind me of the child catcher in "Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang".
What a beautiful machine! Congrats!
Congratulations!🎉🎊🍾🎈
Oooo! This kind of thing would have a lot of applications! Old fashioned peddal lathes, mills, hell you could even improve Leonardo Da Vinci's original power hammer plans for a blacksmith! This is an extremely important invention you just made. Well done!!
You sir are an absolute genius. I've been watching you work on this for about a decade and CANNOT WAIT to see the end result. It will be EPIC
"the human"
Your face when you’re getting it to work 😂😂
Can't you just do it like a music box where you wind it up and just have it consume the wind through the fly wheel? But instead of fixing the spring to a stationary object, you fix it to the winding handle?
That’s awesome!
Isn't that an escape mechanism from some old clocks?
I love you! 😍💖
The satisfactory laugh 😆 well done
Even flow
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💪🏽🎉🎊
That is amazing in sync is at 117, as a hermetic teacher myself I can C how that number makes sense. That number is also a learning curve of 54 n 63 it is the resonance of thy heart without human error or discord like the 0440 mhz which Iam sure u are aware of.
Does this mean that marble machine 2 is happening?
Vile valo
I thought we left bro back in 2018
Holy crap I remember this video from back when viral videos were a thing!
Well from a person that doesn't know anything about this. The look and grin you did is weird
Oh, hi. You’re back.
Ues it wid take only a flywheel to make even pwr delivery
Can we use this to drive fuel-less cars? 😢
wow...that's a REAL analog compressor
Never, ever quit!🤔🤗🤗🤗
It’s really amazing that you’ve iterated on this for so long… but I gotta be honest, I think a big draw to the OG marble machine is just how it’s like a janky dr Seuss contraption.
Whenever this guy posts a video showing this in use for music, I reckon mechanical engineering and sound engineering professors are going to play it for every lecture they teach. I love seeing handmade contraptions!!!
After 8 years…a metronome! Yay!
Totally unqualified but: could you use something like mechanical watches use (O think it's called tourbillion?) but you keep winding it up at the speed that it runs?
So kinda like a player piano
Martin, you've been working on this project so long, I'm very glad you're getting the results you've been after. Without going totally crazy!
Don's teacher was right
Every single piece this guy makes is just sooooo insanely complex and beautiful!  This man is the literal definition of a creative genius
Amazing
And here we are...we have digital "perfection" but Man wants analog "perfection" so he engineers a machine to achieve this, thus completing the dead loop of technological progression to regression back to progression. LOL!
You went from wood to 3D printing. You're a genius, anyway.😎
Skam den som ger sig :D
Man its been forever since I saw this guy, glad he showed up again on my page several years later, in fact im gonna watch his mable machine again 🎉
when physics met his wife, music..
1:20:45 jajajaja que buena
i always be your fan. from the moment you viral with marble machine. i dont know its been 8years. im watching u😂
Idk what you do but I subscribed
Analog quantization! In a decade, it will feel too sterile, and you'll be trying to figure out how to add some swing to it 😂
Interesting
I liked the uneven input machine.
You look like a kitten making biscuits in the beginning🤣🖤
ninguna de mis primas pudo lograrlo ...
Osiem lat żeby zastosować regulator odśrodkowy Watta ? Geniusz... 😅
this would also be a cool upgraded design for a paddle boat.
It took you 8 years to figure out a clutch and a flywheel? They solved this problem hundreds of years ago....
This is so cool, so glad to see you still working!
holy cow he made a mechanical full bridge rectifier just woah
Can i make electricity out of this??
My personal opinion: it kind of removes the human-ness of the music. Sometimes "not so perfect" is what separates us from the machines
Look like a cat making biscuits. This is neither a compliment nor an insult, just an observation.
Now I can turn my cat's bread making into power
The machine that goes Ping
Hey man, I showed your Marble Music Machine video to my engineering students at the end of the semester and they were mesmerized. Can't wait to see what you'll come up with next!
but can it do 3:4 polirythm?
THE MARBLE MAN
This is Analog equivalent of an ADC
Nice
Is not a problem the uneven human rhythm in music.
Me encantaría que tú hubieras una canal en español
Heck yeah man.  This is sick!
Why don't you use a bag of air as a buffer, sort of like how bagpipes function?
this reminds me of the automatic piano pedals
Theo Greyjoy seems to have found time for hobbies with his missing balls 😂
👏👏👏
Congratulations!  Still those human imperfections made music real 😊
Are you rushing or dragging?
Aah! That's likely the mechanical brilliance of a time keeping machine. Maybe?
That laughter is infectious, couldnt stop myself from laughing too.
that laugh… creepy AF! lol
I feel like the semi randomness of cranking it yourself adds charm. The marble machine was so great partially because it was kinda janky, I really hope you don't engineer it to the point that there's no quirkiness anymore.
My cat can power it
YEAH BUT WE LIKE HUMAN MUSIC
I thought main case is to do it with your body, so we can name you "musician" 😂
That laughter in the beginning is just DIABOLICAL… 😂
Congratulations but the uneven tempo, it being powered by an imperfect human without smoothing was one of the things that made the original machine unique. One day I want to make a music machine similar to the Viola Organista, it’d be pedal-powered and I’d keep the smoothing to just a flywheel mechanism for that reason.
R&m car battery vibes.
Some of the stupid disks that aren’t pottery bases or pottery templates or spinning wheels for yarn could be from that type of object.
Bro I remember watching that video forever ago. Amazing phenomenal work sir and incredible persistence.
Nice years in the making been watching for a while
Cat making biscuits but make it engineering
Awesome!
Dudes gonna finish create something akin to "true level" from Rick and Morty and will forever hear music out of tempo
Don't is a metronome, is a monotone 😂😂😂😂
This guy is making those Dr Seuss machines
Buy a music box 😅
I can't believe it's been 9 years since I first saw the marble machine. 😀🇦🇺
artwork in motion with everything he does i swear
data filter
Did you use a threaded rod on the governor as a slip joint? Clever
That villainous cackle
casually created the mechanical equivalent of a full bridge rectifier
Dude made a control system for "not quite my tempo"
Tick tick tick tick tick  FLASH... AAAHHHHH
Martin, this isn't a science experiment. You are going to have to settle. As an engineer I say I get paid to be close enough.
Lmao he built a human rectifier
Now you just need to build a small universe inside a endless void and wait to inteligent life to form, then you introdução this inteligent life to the wonders of eletricity usina your devuce. After that you syphon 80% of this eletricity.  Now you have a reliable battery for your car
Well done that's some amazing work. But didn't they have a way of doing this in the 19th century with player pianos?
Peace among worlds, Rick.
J'adore
THIS DAMM INSANE GUY MADE IT.
This governor is where the term "balls the walls come from" old windmills
Did you invent a massive metronome?
Well if this is something that hasn't been done on a national level I applaud you but what I would definitely see as another use is for human power generators that's always been a big deal is that the inconsistency of a pedaling person can never power you know a generator properly and this could give you that you know real time generator where we're all looking Well if this is something that hasn't been done on a national level I applaud you but what I would definitely see as another use is for human power generators that's always been a big deal is that the inconsistency of a pedaling person can never power you know a generator properly and this could give you that you know real time generator where we're all looking for
I found you After loving that one video, I found you
in  a few months its 10 years ago he uploaded that one video. it was march the 2nd
Solved a problem that he created
Are the small extra Windows perhaps there for sensors, rather than people?
I can see applications on sailboats.
It's been such a satisfying process to watch!
I'm proud of you
bro...what makes music wonderful is the emotional input of humans. which is a form of imperfection.  but I guess you're part of the crowd who forgot how singers without pefect pitch smooth voices or grand ochestras, used to make people cry.  music is becoming more perfect which makes it suck.
This guy is a mad man 😂
Im so glad we have an update
Bro reinvented the phonograph
He is giving black 🐈‍⬛ cat vibes
Made AC to DC
Just why? Input? 100W. Output after all? 20W?
... looks like slavery with extra steps.
Isn’t that taking the music out of the equation?
B-But the human error adds SOUL and is there even a LIVE RECORDING with added noise just so I can REALLY feel it? ...god I wish more people could just simply accept perfection instead of sticking to their boomer musicians who couldn't hold a note if they wanted to. I can't wait for AI to take over the music industry.
wow i think i saw your vids making this music instrument before pandemic, now you're still on this
Isn't a pendulum like in a clock the simple solution?
The more he takes himself out of the loop like the the closer he gets to where he might as well use a digital sequencer
Its good engineering. Its going to make artificial, mechanical sounding music.  Music being just a little less precise and accurate makes for better music.
Men, when left alone, will build cool shit for the fun of it.
Mecanicle capaciter
Holy shit man, I remember seeing this when I was younger. Genuinely it's impressive seeing you still working on this amazing idea
I wonder if it is more efficient ...
congrats...I have been watching your channel, from long time ago...I am so happy for your innovation.
So I am not the only one who thinks that it's functionality is same to a working capacitor.  Anyways, IS THAT A FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER???
Ting ting ting ting ting, ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting, ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting, ting ting ting ting ting
I liked the old machine it made it sound unique
Hey man, just from seeing the little video on the side I remembered the tone of your video on the marble machine. Great work
Bro made quantization in Real Life
He looks like he's making biscuits
The marble machine song is my mom’s ringtone
YES I FOUND WINTERGATAN AGAIN AFTER LIKE 3 YEARS
That laugh, almost at crazy scientist level.  Needs more work
Pure sign wave
Dr Stone!
I believe they had to solve this same problem with the old pianos that played off of a roll of paper with holes in it ... and pedals.  Fascinating. Love the anolog engineering.
You absolute maniac! I love it!
hahahahahaha :)
cvt
Even tho the end goal of the machine is to do music at the perfect tempo, as only a human, I think that removing all those little things makes the end music less human, and more mechanical. And what I liked about the marble machine songs is that the sound is human.
Needs a cat
That evil genius laugh in the beginning XD
For the first few seconds, I thought that you'd you into hard techno.
It’s the machine from Rick and Morty that the people on Rick’s planet had to step on to make power 🤣🤣
You make me hate me Swedish accent.
The genius is back. Yesssss let him cook.
I've been wanting to do this with air plane instead. Found out that already happened.
It's funny that you can tell by sight alone that this guy is Scandinavian
I love a well deserved evil scientist laugh. 😂
🤦
How does this dude buy food
There is already 7 years that he is solving problems. Where is the final machine?
Just use full bridge rectifier xd
He looks like a cat kneading at the start
Legend !!
But the irregularities are what make the music pleasurable
Bro’s autism intellect is unmatched
no one: rick in a tini-verse:
Yo no le hago mal a nadie...
May be dumb but couldnt you also just turn it electric and then use a voltage regulator and then connect to a motor
dude they solved this in the eighteen hundreds
this is artist, amazing channel bro
I think the off tempo is what makes it special to remind me a human is cranking it and it's not arranged on a computer as much. feels more real. I would leave it be as cool as this is
Dude your voice is so soothing that this short alone almost put me to sleep!
Is that 3d printed? What's the brand/material? I like the color.
You are a legend
Oh no he has managed to remove the humanity from the machine... Now excuse me while I go listen to some of the YT videos of your brother's one man band.
Remove the audio tracks in your channel settings!!!
at what point do you get to a solution where digital electronics are what you're actually looking for?
This guy got the best flavor
Wow, that's impressive!  Martin developed super fast the last years. I really like how he doesn't just do whatever comes in his mind, but rethinks it over and over again until he has a perfect solution.
My friend made a system to generate electricity for music
I need the design docs for a pedal lathe
Bro your inventing thing that can and probably be utilized for other things. You could get elrich in the process.. Blackwell you already are rich in spirit and purpouse
This would've gone so hard in the 1700s
Whoovile mf
Not quite my tempo 😤🤬
You mean like when you peddle a bike and let the wheel spin,
mechanical torque filtering 😮
You just made a mechanical AC to DC converter
Bro, how did you get funded for this? I have amazing ideas, but zero investors. Where are they?
I have loosely followed this project for a long time, I am so happy to see how much progress you've made!!!!!
the best part about projects like this is the amount of experience/knowledge/intuition acquired on the way to the goal. The cherry on top is the end result
Uh. I get the problem. But let's not pretend like a human can't keep a beat 😂😂
Awesome. Now you need to implement my magnet motor. 100% FREE energy. Maybe adding it to your device will help it develop mainstream attention. It's insanely simple to make. Has minimal moving parts and produces usable torque and RPM.  Feel free to contact me for further information.
Keep going
Terrence Fletcher gonna meet his match on this one
Taste victory? Nga are you the emperor of mankind?
Happy for you man great work
Doohickey
bro just  casually laugh like gojo satoru
Love your use of a drumstick as a pointer!
Just use a centrifugal speed governor
dude is making analogic ableton
Suena como una máquina, fría, "perfecta" gran logro de la ingeniería, es una cajita musical muy compleja.
Marble Machine 3 is powered by making biscuits
I think that the human tempo gives the marble machine the best tempo variation or groove, if you take it away and flatten the tempo it will lose its natural feeling. So maybe you want to flatten the tempo to synchronize it with a computer, anyway, congratulations for your achievements!!
Yes but i prefer the human swing. But impressive and cool.
I'll be honest. Originally when the marble music machine popped into my Rec feed on release I wasn't too interested and would've rather had watch animusic. But I started to see some things from your shorts. And then my daughter saw the video Rec on my feed and so we listened to it. I should've years ago it was great and I'm loving seeing this evolution as well. I'm sorry it took me so long to watch this all
When you laugh, I got scared.
You sir are a genius.  Your endless pursuit of excellence amazes (and exhausts) me. I don't know where you find the energy and determination and never give up philosophy
This is already an invention
Ursa: "I've decided to play without an extra settler"  Me: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?  Ursa: **gets turned into crisps 50 turns in**  Me: Yeah, that's to be expected.
Ahh I was wondering where you gone off to? Im glad your still on your music projects 👍
Why didnt you just use an escapement
This is wonderfully maniacle!
you know the wonderful thing about the original is human error, i get the obsession and the desire to build a solve and smooth it out but musically, i wonder if the impressive feat will make for something more boring musically, its you’re reinventing midi quantising just mechanically.
I don't say or do this much specifically for people like this man here. Very creative and knowledgeable exactly like a teacher   Subscribed!
Bro is recreating mankind's transition from physical labor to automated machinery... as a hobby.   Let's go.
lo unico que entendi es q gneran un sonido agradable y que las maquinas se adaptan a un armonico a un sonido en particular agradable y que con el tiempo se mantiene a una minimo movimiento por las crestas de la onda del sonido
8 years. Already ? It's been great to follow you. Nice mad scientist laugh.
Love that you solved this crazy problem that may seem nothing to others but was important to you. It probably does have some real world solution we just haven’t found it yet.
I cannot believe you are still working on this, I remember when you were working on the previous machine and finally gave up for awhile since it was just not working, I thought that was the end, but you never did give up, did you? You went back to the drawing board and made it happen. I am so happy for you!
Sound engineers also usually demand a voltage stabilizer for the sound system like DAC, speaker/headsets, etc. often to the hyperbolic extent too. (Or maybe my ears havent been trained for expensive audiophile stuffs) Wouldn't have thought that this could be done mecanically.
This whole series is just Wintergatan speedrunning his own personal industrial revolution.
God’s creation is awesome!
constant speed drive 😄
You are a fuckin genius!!!
I don't get why it has to be perfect timings, when error is what makes us humans
Increible
I think this man will take us to Mars sooner than Elon Musk. XD
But why? Isn't the human variation the fun part about live music? How it's not take 529 in the studio, or a synth, but actually performed with human skill? I get that this is really interesting from an engineering standpoint, but IMO it kinda takes the soul out of the music. If you achieve what you seem to be working towards, every performance of every song is going to be absolutely identical, and at that point, why not just play an audio recording, or even better: make the whole thing with a sequencer.
look, i get it, but also half the appeal of the og was the cranking, clanking human part of it, and the fact you could change tempo/it slows down on wind down
What a great milestone. V3 is off to a great start!
I told NASA about the Moon and they made Moonfall ; )  Its not too late, need to make a Universe room and reverse Tesla ball atmosphere models, also just spray desalination ocean water, not aluminum and carbon which cause refractory radiation and is cooking the atmosphere and causing refractory radiation on the surface making it intense, also you might be able to change an orbit  It is imperative that we stop spraying aluminum and CO2 into a magnetoshere and start spraying desalinatated ocean water instead, were causing refractory radiation and it's making the heat much more intense and heating the planet and causing melting of ice caps and evaporation of ocean water which then makes fresh clouds; we need to just spray salt free ocean water. The more we try to cool the planet were actually making it hotter and energizing a magnetoshere which could cause more solar flares and fry us. We're cooking the planet and causing solar evaporation of the ocean for clouds formation instead of just misting H20 out of 747's, got a whole plan  Hello my Friends  ANUBIS IS THE BEST DOG  What if Pharoah was trying to build a weather machine to attract lightening to nuclear electro magnetic earth ground to cause more rainfall and thus more food.   Clouds of higher solar charged particles jump to clouds of lower static change, known as heat lightening, as nature seeks a balance.   When there's enough solar charge in a cloud electricity as lightening crosses the air insulator and connects to earth, as it does it creates a vortex where hydrogen and oxygen particles connect and bring down water droplets and fall due to nuclear electromagnetic gravitational earth gravity.   Electrons go around an atom like the moon around the earth and the planets around the sun.    The Egyptians saw that lightening was attracted to metal, and the higher the better.   If Pharoah had a copper cap on the pyramids with electrodes running through the air chambers down into the spring underneath, Benjamin Franklin might have been wearing an Eye of Horus Watch and driving a Bently.  Is the grounds turned dry, like a leather glove, no matter how much you tried to arc welds, it wouldn't work. Tree roots go searching for water in the winter when there is no rain, as solar photoelectric synthesis move through an organism seeking earth ground.  Also lightening is more likely to hit the lone farmhouse than the neighborhood, as electricity in houses flow through a black or hot wire, and take a neutral [white wire] path back to the electrical panel, where the Neutral Bar is bonded to the Ground Bar and goes into the earth via an eight foot copper electrode to dissipate returning unused current into the ground. So neighborhoods are energizing water tables instead of storing that electricity in batteries.  Anyways, I'm thinking a cargo helicopter, a brand new Copper Cap for each pyramid, and copper electrode wires running down to earth ground via the spring water table, and electrodes can be drilled into the earth below the springs for better contact, and we can complete Pharoah's Weather Experiment as lightening is attracted to metal high up from the ground ; )  Could you imagine the attraction of this new event to honor the Pharoahs and those that built the Pyramids!  And maybe bring more rain to the earth, and keep it most, and electrically conductive and inductive to storm clouds for more crop rain.   If you want to in vent some cool stuff im at 224x833x2094 usa  Also, should we celebrate ancient ruins or rebuild them to honor ?  Also oil rigs should be underwater and not above and you wouldn't have oil spills   China builds underwater structures, you could be just 20 feet underwater, you can run vertices flexible stormproof snorkles and a flexible to surface entrance/exit   And,   Grow more opium most the world's doesn't even want to be here and people can move other places, it grows in attics that are 140 degrees, skylights would need insulated glass in the attic shafts and you could use mirrors in the gable ends, just don't be in the attic in the day, if there's ever a shortage  Also oil rigs should be underwater and not above and you wouldn't have oil spills. China builds underwater structures, you could be just 20 feet underwater, you can run vertices flexible stormproof snorkles and a flexible to surface entrance/exit   Sharks could be GPS chipped at a bait source and an alert could go to cell phones and beach alert systems if sharks are within 300 M  Aluminum spayed in the atmosphere might f you magnetically with solar flares  Use aluminum for other things, spraying carbon and aluminum heats up the planet and causes refractory radiation on the surface, the carbon in the clouds traps in the heart and in the ocean causes dead spots. You need solar distilled ocean water misted or of 747's instead, the sun will burst up H2O into H, O1's, making 02, O3 ozone, and you're actually adding more fresh water clouds up there, not depending on surface evaporation by causing more heat in order to make more clouds, you need to cool it  8.4 billion acres of grass=4 billion cows in the world shipped frozen fresh lawn mower clippings somewhere cool like Alaska and each cow gets a bowl of ice cream at each feeding session  You need a leaf sucker truck with a refrigeration unit, grass is mowed for tax refunds, 20 Million jobs paying 60k from May to October in air conditioned, sealed window, tinted window, XFM lawn mower cabs with triple level suspension seats, mini leaf suckers pick up small piles and dump them by the street, big leaf sucker truck picks them up and freezes the frozen grass and then it goes to rail cars then somewhere cool to be 1100 lbs with a boney jacket. The people that kiss cows and sing songs for them take care of them and she gets a bowl of ice cream at the end of each feeding season. You'd have 10x more cows, over 1 Trillion in goods. In the US you'd have to double your grocery stores just for the milk, cheese, cheese cream, sour cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, milk, butter, ice cream, etc...  When she doesn't want to be a cow anymore she gets a bowl of ice cream with some fennies   I have a lot of invention ideas in energy, defense, security, food infrastructure etc...  Would like to meet up with some people and talk to them about making some cool stuff  Missing solar film wrap on high rises and fields shouldn't have solar panels but should be solar panel green houses growing every crop everywhere, humid and tropical warm all year growing facilities
That’s some Dr.Seuss sh!t right there.
Such a waste of time and resources
yes! 😆
What a complete psychopath.   In a good way.
AC to dv
Yo man, I've been following Wintergatan since the beginning (still your song pops out in my playlists) and I always appreciated the effort you put put in realizing your own instruments and particular music! It's really awesome that you never abandoned the project and still rock on the tube!
And I thought I was a perfectionist....
Hahahaha the sheep took multiple bio weapon in the arm 🐑🐏💉🧬💀
Mechanical quantization 😂
I remember when this first came out i would listen to all the songs made with it
oh damn mechanical load balancer. i wonder what the threshold for the preload before it becomes in sync
Mayne a rise a pd . Then i conyrol.the outlet by a equlaising vakvw ie the pressuee hwlps open close the valve bkdy to ita seats
You done it!
I liked the human input during Wintergaten. It made it sound like man and machine were dependent on each each other for proper output, just like in any hand played instrument.  When you started spooling it up after the break with the xylophone, it sounded frigging awesome.   Congrats on your achievement, however. It is nothing short of fantastic.
Bravo!! Now humanize it 😊
"ARE YOU RUSHING, OR ARE YOU DRAGGING?"
Amazing accomplishment
Thats what you would call a rectifier in my field! bravo! my whole job is basically doing what you do except with electricity!
How much energy do you lose to stabilize?...
i'll be sad when the work is done
Lamento decirte que ese mecanismo ya existe, solamente que no lo habías usado😂😅
🫱🏼🫲🏼
But... is music actually better without fluctuations in tempo?? I think most musicians will disagree.. fluctuations in tempo can be used to create emotion.. so.. can you influence the tempo .? Then you are done
This bro haa written beautiful music and now I'm just discover he is a ingineer. What a brilliant guy
Ooga ooooG, what dis doohickey??? Gruguh not understand!
I think you need some sleep
Thats amazing.  But what is all this. Gears?
Amazing problem solving, but it is clear the machine will never finish. The first one that was "eh good enough " at least delivered.  I think it is totally ok thought because  one enjoys the collection of problem solving videos. Already those are great
😂👍👍👍
if this mechanism gets finalised i can finally realise my dream of having a bunch of hamsters running on a treadmill for power
created a metronome.
Human invents making biscuits
only 5 more years before it's finished! :)
BROOOO I REMEMBER THIS GUYYYY AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Martin... I LOVE your want for knowledge and accuracy. Problem is . Art and music aren't always perfect, they're about feelings and emotions and those inaccuracies are what can make it beautiful. Please stop being so hard on yourself, ok?
He made a massive metronome
Bro made a manual full wave rectifier  Sick
Mechanical integrator with target speed regulator and power storage
OUR MAN’S STILL AT IT!
The notes being out of sync by just a fraction is what makes human music so special.  Computer music will sound too perfect and weird I can assure you. That imperfection is perfect in its own way
im sure it can be done much easier
I'm very happy to see you solving a problem. But I'm also a bit worried that removing the human imperfection will just make it sound dull boring machine music. Also, playing with the tempo real time can be very interesting effect.   Anyway, keep following your dreams! I'll check your work out every now and than :)
Why you launch like Gojo
Congratulations, Martin! You must feel so proud & satisfied to see all your hard work pay off! Bravo 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This is PID
Physical capacitor
Wow, that’s super cool man! So creative so many different parts.. props 👏
Make a plumbus next time
This a cat input bro
Looks like something that would be made in a cartoon with all the gears and cogs and things
when i first saw your video i thought the way to do this is to charge a battery manually and have it send a constant energy🗿
It was nice a decade ago but now??? It is Boeing you are obsssed
Thats cool man but dont take away from the original marble machine music.  Its legendary
Making the best instrument even being just a big, unpractical digital synth xD
How about use a nuclear reactor.  Haha just a joke have a great day😂😂😂😂
Congrats you just remade steam engine tech...
Mechanical FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER @ElectroBOOM
I never thought id see an instrument with a ball governor, thats pretty hilarious
Fly wheel and free wheel
He's still doing this?!
Honestly, i kind of really like the somewhat off-tempo feeling of the original crank system. It makes the music feel much more natural.
Your still alive 😂
It took you almost twenty years to figure out how to put a governor on the machine?  Buddy. I'd have given up long ago. Props to you, my man.
I get why you like it but I'll miss the hand spun feel
Yeh, makes sense that he does that.
I wonder how the old movie cameras that were cranked did it.
That laugh had a mixture of intensity and evil genius
I remember seeing the first machine years ago and that song still plays in my head.
So does it work via inertia (in essence it’s a fly wheel) so that your irregularity doesn’t significantly impact the rotational velocity?
I went from being 8 and my music teacher showing us you and your marble machine during some lesson on musical history and stuff. And now your onto this. Super impressive
So you made a metronome?
I will call this the "thingamajig"
Windmills been using this for ages
HOLY SHIT I ALWAYS CAME BACK TO WINTERGATAN, ONE OF THE VIDEOS I HAVE TO REWATCH ONCE AND THEN
Doohickey
Holy crap, you're still alive?
Think something is lost when you normalised the human torque into a fixed value - no better than just running an electric motor at that point. Its the varience, that gives character, the variance that produces different music between performances. Otherwise i'd just listen to a MIDI.
i’m seeing a lack of rick and morty references😔
A pendulum's frequency only depends on the length of the string. Could have saved you some work.
Damn, still not done with this machine😅
did you use ideas from old player pianos? I saw a video one day talking about those fixing the same problem.
Wait i remember you
bros sus
PID?
Doohickey
1 good job 2 i thought this was obvious and you were already using a rotation governor
Dude, making something this neat, functional, and compact for the application this is what I aspire too. Fr this is impressive
This guy is fucking brilliant.  You don't see this mechanical work anymore.
Bro just made an engine that doesnt need gas
Seeing this evolving over the years has been amazing 😍 fantastic job❤
Not gonna lie i forget you and this project exist for like a year at a time. Then, out of nowhere, you pop up with some new piece of this project. Keep it going. I cant wait to see it completed in 2073.
Why not use a dynamo and some kind of a full bridge rectifier?
Finally....flooblebox technology in our era!
Don't you think that by removing all imperfections in your machine you will also  remove its soul ? If you want something perfect just use a piano !
Good for solving a problem :) But. Just a thought. When digital media came along we noticed that a lot of stuff sounded worse than analog tapes. Why? Because analog may have "deformed" the audio recorded, but also made it better that way. So while digital is super precise and all, it also can take away the beautifulness of analog deformity. Sometimes being precise, is not better. Sometimes it is.
Mehdi would be proud of this FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER
WERE YOU RUSHING OR DRAGGING?!
I remember seeing the original video almost 10 years ago. It blew my tiny mind, cant wait to see the next iteration.❤
That's just slavery with extra steps
Spins the shaft lmaooo
How is he gonna play tightly with the moving keys he has shown recently? I would think the position of the key would affect the timing of the marble hitting it.
The unevenly movement is what give life to tye music
Un genio!!! 🎉
That is AWESOME!
well done!
I still love the video with the old wood machine.  watched it last night actually.
Okay, so the fact that this is a 100% pure mechanical solution, and not electronic is absolutely amazing. However, it's also important to set it up to allow for tempo changes, otherwise you won't be able to play things like the original marble machine song. Um... Does that song have an official title?
Can u do a song about Gaza
Cant you just use the same mechanism as a manual watch?
Congratulation!!!
That looks like the same method they used to prevent windmills from going to fast with centifical force
Tbh I liked the inconsistencies in his original machine
The flyball governor really brings it together visually.
I remember watching the video, like 5/7 years ago, hello there
Quantizing via flywheel, gear ratios, chain drives... truly mad scientist shit, I love it.
I thought Governers are meant to be vertical?
While I do love and appreciate the machine doing what you’re wanting I think that the small imperfections in the music gives it a lovely human quality and breaths life and personality into it
life has been quantized
just make your music using a computer at this point, if you gonna go so far to take all the human out of your music
Fricking YouTube unsubscribing me...
"Kiełba już gotowa" :) Like/Sub xD
Yes!!
❤😊
You mean an ac to dc converter?
I can't read the text in video because of youtubes new comment over video feature.
You look like a cat making biscuits.
It's like a FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER 😅
Is that a gooble box ?
He Sounds like a supervillian in the beginning
The Gooble Box!
I just watch that video yesterday. Was showing it to my kids
*So 8 years wasted to replace a cheap motor?!?*
Dont go so far that it loses it soul !
построй что то типа педальногоу стройства что бы на лодке без топлива можно было передвигаться крутя педали..катамаран не панацея слишком малая скорость. а тут есть потенциал
👍👌👏
Mad professor laugh and look!
Dude you look tired
Hype!!
I appreciate the "human" nature of imperfection, including in live music, but I also appreciate your drive to set your own standards ever-higher, never settle for less than you know you can achieve.  You keep finding new problems to solve, and you keep doing it.  I'm so proud of and inspired by you. Thanks for sharing your journey, please keep going as long as you can. The world is a more beautiful place with curious and innovative minds shining brightly, as you do! <3
You are a madman 😂
cant wait for the new realese
Reallllly excited to see this one ima subscribe because I think your awesome
Lmao, this is why I love PEOPLE. We just do shit!! Thanks for the inspiration man
The laughter of a crazy genius trapped inside a humid castle making dark techno
Dude wtf were the videos on this one😂
I don't even understand the problem, let alone the solution. Good work, I think!
I like that you went with a fly-ball governor.
That's a complicated metronome
"They said I could never teach a lama how to to drive a car! They were wrong!"
Some would argue that the human element of playing an instrument is what gives it life. In fact, they have special plugins that try to make machine music more human like so that its not as perfect.
....wow.... 8yrs. 🎉😊
He’s letting perfection get in the way of good. Miss the music he made with the first machine.
The uman
Wtf
Is this even done yet?
Can we get a blueprint
i am astounded and i  totally appreciate what you have done.  it is really revolutionary, but i am a little drunk, so I cannot specifically say how this will help us, but i know it will, because i have given much sober thought to just such a problem. You are a savior of mankind's effort.
I've never watched the super bowl, but I'm always down for the hyperbole. Now shut up and make your machine, it's been a decade. I've had six kids in that time. You were 20, now you're 80. Get on with it, crank the handle monkey!
Congratz!!!
Not quite my tempo.
I think the answer to your problem is a GEAR REDUCER. We use them in industrial electrical applications. They control electric motors so they will keep a constant rpm even if the electric current fluctuates. I think if you study gear reducers, you will probably figure out how to apply that knowledge to your machine.
U should go to got talent so u become famous now just youtube but u can be world musicians
Niki lauda
Nice!
This is a mechanical engineer's wet dream hehe
I feel like half the reason we enjoy humans playing music is BECAUSE the tempo is not exact. As we have never had perfect timing until computers.
this man has been building a doohickey for like 10+ years and ive never escaped the small snippets of the journey
Sometimes the groove/vibe needs a human touch but this is so cool
Use a cat
Dude is looking like a madman after all those years! lol
Vad häftigt!
I re found this guy bro this is a forgotten memory unlocked
I saw that marble machine video like 10 or 20 years ago, then never again since. How did I recognize this guy within the first second of the video
Wow, a James Bond villain laugh!
Who knew that a governor, of which was designed over 200 years ago would be the solution to steady rpm.....  Guy out here trying to reinvent the wheel, but just making the same wheels we already had and calling them new
basically made a full bridge rectifier but for mechanical inputs 😅
OK, but now get on with it, no more delays...please!
I think we'll get GTA6 before the new marble machine.
Damit, first they made Funnybot and now this. Germans always trying to replace us. Also we already had one of these. It's called a drum machine
now make a hamsterwheel to run it.
I'm proud of you broksi
Bro has a face like a dropped pie
We do the same thing in electrical, you'd be surprised how "dirty power" can screw things up.....sounds like a sales gimmick huh?
average tech-priest in 40k explaining to you why you're undergoing an augementation
that laugh is so great.  An excited giddy release.
I was just thinking i needed something like this about  2 days ago lol
You ate mustard 😋
Already been done.  A bicycle with an elliptical chainring is what you’re describing.
hasn’t this been around since they invented self playing pianos?
Thought it was jerking the wooden stick
Hit it Joe!
Is he insane?
its been too long bro
imagine someone using the second one to power something evenly
It won’t make interesting music if a human doesn’t dictate the rhythm
Bro said naw I don’t like electricity let’s do the same concepts but with mechanical power instead
Qh my gawd, that man is still going !! How insane 🎉🎉🎉
My body is ready!
A transmission?
Looks like something from a Dr.Seuss book
I guess a coil spring driving shaft Like a victrola was too easy?
Does this guy have another job or he only does this machine his whole life?
Clocks have good rhythm.
bring back the jank
What if there could be a street legal vehicle that operated by a human cycling or stepping?
evil laugh!😂 Genius
Holy shit, if you turn this into a double bass lol
This new system is tight. I did also like the slow uneven startup in the original machine. It gave the music a bit of human struggle kind of like when you need to get a bike moving again but its hard because you have no speed. Anyways too long didint read manicken är väldigt nice 👍
you didn't instantly think "clock" when you were having this problem?  The genius of a clock is the pendulum, power source, and escapement.  Master those things and you will get constant time.
Victory?  What game is this??
Väldigt imponerande. Snyggt jobbat!
Ah, so that’s how goobleboxes are made
So you copied the governor mechanism out of an old wind-up gramophone?
Yes, what I want from a techno-folk band is inhuman precision. :P
I Cannot wait, Awesome Job!
Bro is pro. 💯🙏🏼
Don't all automatic watches already do this?
Steampunk autotune
That was the most villainous laugh I’ve ever heard after revealing his master invention
Make some sweet music for us. We need some new material from u. My kids grew up on you stuff :)
This is like a Wild West circus contraption and I love it.
That unevenness gives it a more human,  interesting feel.    If you want clockwork, just get ableton or something dude.  Save yourself 8 years of headache.
I knew who this was just by the picture!  ❤️
Bravo!
*laughs in El Estepario Siberiano*
Miss when the Marble Machine was about the mistakes
He essentially made a Constant Speed Drive (CSD). Takes a varying rate of speed and outputs a single "constant" speed (Common in aircraft generators)
look at that evil laugh.. he is at one compas of turn into a villain.
The psychopathic stare and laugh got my attention, 😂, your dope machine kept it. Great work man.
This is called a gobble box...not a flywheel/huygens weight/governor/flywheel thingamabob.
I LOVE THIS SONG, it's been years!!
"Balls to the walls" or "ball out" regulator mechanisms have been used on many devises. Steam engines, hit and miss engines, phonographs,  to name a few.
I was all ready for the gizmo and doohickey competition and then they said this mf was my opponent 😭
This is no longer an instrument atp
I haven’t seen your video in years but I’m glad I saw this man your machines are inspiring. Thank your for the amazing art!!
Your Gooble Crank is out of date
Can you put a cat in bread-making mode as the motor for that machine?
Idk, I am interested to hear the music that comes from this, but I feel like part of the marble machine magic is the direct performance between the human crankshaft input and it's effect on the tempo.
The young Wintergatan: "Dad, I want to be a musician" Dad: "Nope, you're going to be an engineer, like your father, your grandfather and your grand-grandfather!" Wintergatan: "Well dad, what if I become a musician AND an engineer?"
I swear this already exists in old pianos that allowed it to play recordings at a set rate
Awesome.
wouldn't a capacitor pack just solve the problem?
Davinci would do this if he still alive today
HES STILL GOING???
Y
I ate a bag of chips today and failed a few runs of balatro. What did you do?
Geez I'd hate to be your bandmate. I'd always be wondering if you think that I not playing the guitar tight enough..
Kind of like an AC/DC converter.
DUUDE I USED TO WATCH YOU MARBLE MUSIC VIDEO
The autism is autisming 😂
You mean like a bagpipe or a clock?  8 years?
Electrical engineers: hrmmm
Wait until this guy finds out about ai generated music.
Didn't one of the Dr. Stone episodes show a simple ("simple") way to get a consistent speed out of human powered machines.
The Machine: Not quite my tempo
But what makes music so special is the human element. We all have different cadences, rhythm and feel. All this gets put into our music so even if two people play the same thing it gives different flavors. I don’t see the need to remove that. I think his turning of the wheel was best because things changed as his excitement peaked or as he got more tired or picked up tempo.
Is he still working on the marble machine? I thought that thing was amazing already.
is this kind of work mechatronics would do?
Ah but how will you tackle a variable tempo
Great and I do t just mean your face
I love watching these but I see so many opportunities to get dragged in and hurt.  Curse you, SAFETY MEETINGS!
TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT
this looks like slavery with extra steps. xD
I love the smell of a fill bridge rectifier in the morning! Smells like...victory!
Analog quantizer.
Awesome
i think an automatic watch does the same thing, you just went too complex brother
Oh wow, it's been so many years since first marble machine. Crazy this is still being perfected.
Dont trust him!. He is going to make this output sustainable energy and enforce everyone all over the world to use it and little do we know,  he will steal a small output from each machine and transfers it to another dimension to power his damn brake lights on his car WAKE UP!
Strange machinery, evil European laugh at the beginning of the video “hahaha yes!”. Think we got ourselves a Frankenstein boys.
a mechanical cat biscuit maker
Rhythm regulator
the unevenness is what makes it nice
ive only bin screaming this at you for 8 years lol
Congratulations🎉
Genio
I love your dedication to tightness in the beat, but honestly I wonder if it’s too tight right now? It’s good to have a completely steady tempo, but I think the ideal drum track is one where the drummer listens to a metronome while playing so they never stray from the beat, but also the hits aren’t always landing absolutely perfectly on the beat. Gives it a more organic feel that way. A good example of this is beats by J Dilla if you need a reference
That's brilliant engineering! Congratulations on your progress!
Personally I liked that the machines had variable speeds depending on who was turning the wheel
It already exists, it's called CSD constant speed drive, you can find it into aircraft engines
Idk, the slightly imperfect one is more enjoyable to me
You've transitioned to an inventor who happens to like music!😂
Finally, infinite energy if you own a cat
Impressive,i’ve seen something similar in a self playing piano but it used air and bellows instead.
I think if it was almost entirely automatic, only requiring human power but absolutely no input, it would lose the coolness affect of the concept. It doesn't become an instrument anymore, just a machine. Maybe im entirely wrong and this is just for power
so the human aspect of it is removed?
Just like the miniverse in the battery to rick from rick and morty
Why on earth would you want a constant RPM. This wrecks why it sounded great.
At this point he is just a mad scientist  By the way unevennes makes music alive
I haven’t seen this guy in a while
Doesn't get more analogue
Bro really don't like to use fl studio
Look less creepy maybe...
Hehehe
🎉👏👏👏👏👏
Hyper intéressant, je me suis abonnée ya quelques mois, vous êtes super original et intéressant dans votre façon d'aborder la musique de façon mécaniques et harmonique
Maniacal laughter is the only answer after completing a laundry list of a world problems and finally getting to the outcome you seek.
We in the aviation job call this a CSD... Constant Speed Drive.... Been around for a while!
Do you really want it to sit at a fixed bpm though, the human element of slightly varying tempo is a pleasant thing to hear.
Ah yes now I can get consistent power output from all my cat's little biscuit factories
Finally, mechanical capacitor
Bonkers!👍
But it's the uneven timing of a Human that makes the music have feel..🤔
Omg I was in highschool when I first saw the marble machine
👏 nice.
I'm still trying to identify the problem, but it's a cool contraption for sure
Part of the beauty of music is it's imperfections as well
Howndo you musically change the bpm then
It's the year 2065, the marble machine XXV is almost completed. It just needs the last touches of the quantum computer to govern the timing installed.
It took 8 years to do what could be done with a motor some gears and a switch for varying speed?  Talk about over engineering.
Et c'est pour quand la machine fini... ?
This would be good for the power grid
Did this man make mechanical energy capacitors?
Bro made a Fullwave rectifier with a filter circuit included
i see some of your videos in Iran TV😅
When physics meets music 🤌🏽❤️
Very cool this

Naw, that's a Gooble Box... Next up, the Flooble Crank
Somebody get this guy on a drafting table for The Foundation
Man your laugh in the beginning is the BEST!
In 8 more years, we'll finally have a working prototype 😂
I don’t understand what I just saw.
dost a spring   watch already do it ?
I need this for my 3d pri ted xamera slider and gear based printable gimble...u could help this so much
How much energy could you generate if you hooked it up with a turbine?
the sound of the machine beat is fiiire.
I thought that the crank ver. Gave it a unique sound as it built speed back up.
This is how you remove the soul from music.
Thank god your human subject wasn't Lars Ulrich
You are a genius
So you're that legend.
This is genius
Gooble box  ☑️😌
Please, don’t be fooled. This Guy is a Genius.
I recgonized his face instantly and then he laughed like a maniac. Love it
This is talent 🤯
Absolutely unbelievable this guy is amazing always a pleasure to watch thank you so much❤
Excelente...!

I'm getting old
Coming back, that double chin and wart is new😅
Prototype of The Gooble Box.
USING VERY OLD TECH. STEAM POWERED TECHNOLOGY... anyway you are happy and oit sounds like you invented these old tech but to put that aside. im happy for you, been watching for a long time, never commented before. the future is bright! long live analogue tech!
You could add a clutch for when you want to consciously slow down, and maybe a cvt to change thr final speed
This guy's got balls.
Well I'll give you points for the creativity the engineering and all of that but you're the exact problem with music music is not meant to be sanitized there's meant to be f*** ups there's meant to be offbeats there's meant to be all these things that's what makes it a living entity that's what allows them to reach out and touch somebody's soul
What you did was awesome! Although, you suck as a musician!
Congratulations!! You’re a model of perseverance. Well done.
Step two: putting the hand pedals a bit further away from the big exposed flywheel while a wearing long sleeve shirt, thanks.
Is this guy still milking this project?
This is an example of the best case scenario of what YouTube can do. It can facilitate otherwise infeasible ingenuity so that a truly focused, purpose-driven genius can actualize their vision for the benefit (even mere entertainment of this nature benefits us) of humanity.
FUULLL BRIDGE RECTIFIER
Crazy man!)))
Serial killer vibes 😂
That laugh was contagious😂 I just finished watching the movie called Hugo. It made me think of you.😊❤
Hyperbolic? They make a time chamber for that
Sounds like slavery with extra steps...
“Please give me a second I, I need to get my story straight”
A cat would love this thing
This is just an inverter and rectifier, right?
Haha.. Those first seconds are basically identical to how my cat looks at me while she's baking bread out of the cozy lamb fur rug.
I feel like something in this was inspired by a watch or that this could inspire watch design. Like taking uneven power input and converting it to even power seems great for keeping time, no?
U are not human 😂 this is insane
I understand the technical appeal, BUT: It is a really important part of what I enjoy about your music that there is a human imput that is NOT perfect, and it is in a dialog with the mechanical parts.   You might be able to compare it to gothic cathedrals versus neo-gothic cathedrals: The latter churches look less interesting than the older ones, and the reason is, that they are more even and have less human error and small differences in every piece carved.
Bro is building a foundation for a steampunk world.
Why aren't people talking about how sinister it felt in the first scene
This guys still going with this machine. Honestly crazy to think how long he’s been going for now??
Your evil villain discovery laugh is on point…
That’s really excellent. Well done.
i think theres another really good way to do something similar that has been around for yearsss in mechanical watches. They are spring loaded and produce a very very stable rythm and can take uneven signals (from the movement of your hand for example in automatic watches) and they are extremely small too.
Legend
This dude is making an organic synthesizer
8 years!!!
Greatest thing
Human biscuts needed to power it
This guy is a genius on a level most can not understand. Wish i could hang out with this guy for a while. Such a talented person
Great you can now Power Ricks Ufocar.
i can only imagine that a massive flywheel given by some speeding loaded push pedals might have a natural resonance which the human naturally taps into
Ah, I see where you’ve gone wrong. No dancing monkey wearing a little waistcoat & a fez! Schoolboy error! 😂
The coolest and dorkiest thing I've seen on YouTube today. Well done!
"My name is Wintergatan, but my friends call me....gatan"
martin JUST FUCKEN STOP ALREADY  stop trying to made midi machine like please seek help the yt train is drain you i know ive first hand from people  please your starting to reach lolcow levels your not a tech your machinistes stop making a machine perfect a computer is perfect  please get some damn help
That's a big metronome
Salute to you fam 👍💪
I'm kind of confused. Wasn't the restarting of the machine making because it was complicated?
Made a physical capacitor?
Is dude from sweden?
Youre back!!!!!
Well it is good, but the unevenness was something unique in this music. It's like listening to a song on a live event after hearing it 1000 times in the same recorded version - it's like a completely different experience, even though it's still the same song.
i always thought it needed a flying monkey to to turn the crank.
Use a better fly wheel
might as well build a computer and install DAW
the manual train carts in cartoons have the same thing
Idk at what point the human error makes it art instead of print.
j use capacitor brah
Yahoooooooooooooooo🎉😊❤
The flywheel is just a mechanical inductor.
My washing machine does this already
Very nice solution to the human timing issue. Well done ❤I love your raw talent and physics
I’ve been paying attention to this since I was in elementary school. Amazing work!
This mechanism takes cat biscuits and turns them into beats.
Every time I make a new YouTube I look up homie I’ve been here too long to leave now
I bet his wife thinks this is kinda neat
Lets gooooooo!!!! 🖤🖤🖤
It's awesome !
Good work 👏
Hey a Gooble Box!  What do you do with the dangerous bi-product energy?
Homie couldn’t be bothered to be in time
Bro just built my washing machine without the washing
Dude looks crazy when he stares at the camera.
Rick and Morty step power generator
Now hook it up to your infinitely infamous music machine
Next project, I code a DAW.
hahahhaha! Oh Hi Mark!
Balls to the wall
I have been watching this guys videos for a long time and his machine is awesome
I wouldve just done what they call "giving your lil brother the off controller"
Genius
This is a peak doohickey
Cat 🐱
It's technically amazing, but it's just analog quantizing.
We are all fascinated with how your mind works.
Are you the man of the music machine ???
Steve?
reminds me of a player piano
Well done
so you invented what a computer can easily do? 😂
Awesome! Very impressive work!
So, from AC to DC music.
It’s a centrifugal governor
Guy drops the most viral music video every then goes back to the lab for 8 years to make the loop air tight... Legendary!
They work for each other
dear god i havent seen this man in a WHILE
Literally a mechanical rectifier
I am of two minds on this. On the one hand, I am happy you've solved this challenge. On the other hand, I really liked the organic-ness of the sound when it was "human powered". I feel the same about any music produced. The organic component is important to me.
oh my gosh i remember watching you in elementary school. my teacher used to be amazed by your human piano thing
What part of this doesn't scream crazy?
That's just slavery with extra steps
I am so incredibly happy to see you still working on this project.  The Marble Machine X is going to be a truly unique work of musical and mechanical art when it is finished.
thats how i laugh when i think of my ex
Kinda funny that when I make music on a computer, I'm constantly thinking of ways to add more human elements / randomness, and get away from the mechanical precision, and he's hear doing the opposite.
Doesn't the heavy flywheel do most of the timing for you realistically 😅
man just invented a mechanical capacitor
After 8 years we finally meet again.
Even his laugh is of a mad scientist 😂
PhysicsDuck needs to know about this
Couldn’t you just add a flywheel?
This is basically what a watch escapement does right? You tighten the spring and the escapement converts it into even ticks.
But... the point of music isn't to be tight. It really isn't.
No exaggeration at all, that machine is epic! Well done.
I miss watching the live streams. Will there be anymore?
I love how basically you are reliving the industrial revolution.  Next, you will be plotting heat flow and deriving Carnot's equations.
Pov: what u be up to instead of studying for the test lol
I'll give him another 8 years before he just builds a full musical car.
Moreeeeeee!!!!
Mechanical autotune 😁😏cool
Man I got a shaft I’ll spin at a constant rpm
Please write more music
the human catifier
Noice!
I think you implemented it
EIGHT years? 😮 Respect!
Musical genius 😂❤
That’s How i learn programming 😂
You just mare a synchroscope lol
I remember seeing something about this many years ago
I kind of understand that you want it to be perfect, but then again, should you just use a computer if it's gonna sound like one? I loved the first machine, no matter how imperfect it was.
The doohickey final boss
So u built a gooble box from rick and morty
Bro people loved the track you've made for the first one, the "crazy machine" was just a cherry on top.
rpm regulator?
your making this lesss and less interesting
Flooblecrank
Don't mechanical watches have a mechanism specifically for this purpose? But I suppose that they are only good for small amounts of force.  It would probably be too large and difficult to make one that could deal with a lot of force.  Regardless, my intuition makes me think that using air pressure would work well for this, like a bellows, but I suppose a flyball governer makes good sense too.
That just looks like slavery with extra steps
This looks like the device from Rick and Morty with extra steps.
*So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. -Psalm 90:12*   *And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. -John 8:32*   *For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. -1 Corinthians 10:26*   *Jesus is The Way, Truth & The Life!*
Brilliant engineering & quality machining
Sewing machine solved it long ago
I can't wait for you to really build the MMX and play it
The fly wheel to his left is freaking me out...
Seems like slavery with extra steps
Bro built an AC to DC rhythm converter!!
any new songs?
Trump would say it: "This is the best thing ever made, maybe in all of history, at least in my time!"
Hilarious that psychotic mad scientist laugh! Well done, bravo! 🎩📴
you don't need perfect time the human element makes it cool
AC DC
Flywheel...
Mans playing Minecraft create mod irl
Bro I loved your marble machine I saw it when I was a kid and when I’m stressedi go back and watch it❤
You should definitely payment this because it's excellent
meanwhile producers looking for ways to avoid mechanical even tempo and add randomness to their beats to replicate human tempo 😂
That is so much more impressive than most people probably realize.
Still waiting for the album.
There's a piano add-on that does the same thing. Pump the vacuum-pulling pedals, and it plays a scored sheet of music, on tempo, and automatically.
Brother turned sine halfwave wave power input into sine/constant power input.
Why would you want to cut the human element out of an instrument? Hey I hear quartz crystals keep time pretty well!
How many children did you kidnap so far?
Now I know why the teacher in Whiplash was so mad. ...not my tempo
fixed output rate? nothing to solve? you can produce that in 1000000 different ways. if you change the tempo does your human input drift the sync?
AC to DC
The human element is what makes music worth listening to.
This reminds me of the time I slammed the refrigerator door on my junk over and over again.....because it was there and there was nothing else to do.
Next thing will see will be him scrapping everything and starting building v5 because the rhythm was too tight and sounded like a machine.
Isnt it like first velocity regulator invented in steam era?
Although: once the sound becomes perfect, will it lose its character?
Bruh.. we had could do that since the cotte.gin and steam engine with that spinning all thing..
King engine from opm
after 8 years
Patent it
Huge work around to not look up
I havent seen anything on this for an entire year jesus
I'm so happy for you!! You've been working on this for 8 years!! Way to stay at it!!  P.s. my kids, who are now 9, 7, and 5, still request "the Marble Machine song" as well as "the MegaMan Modulin song"! 🤗🤗🤗  Thank you for being a part of our lives and enriching us with beautiful music, ingenuity, and persistence!! 🤗♥️💪
That marble music machine was the first YouTube video I ever watched
Shit’s weird bro. You German?
Im confused how when makijg a self playing instrument it took him 8 years to look up what mechanism a self playing piano uses.
so a mechanical capacitor
Medic tf2
This concept actually applies to life and death as well.  When we are young our body takes all the various input and creates a steady output. But as we age our bodies are no longer able to stabilize the output as well and it progressively gets worse; aka, age-related decline.  Great to see someone reversing the concept, even if it's in a completely different discipline.
Bro just invented the gooble box
Leave it to a German to over engineer music...
What does it mean to be personaly hyperbolic
Is that a Gooble Box or a Flooble Crank?
I was hoping you were going to say perpetual motion, damn
Man consistent power is what the automated piano's did hundreds of years ago. Gear system with a vacuum and foot pedal pumps
All I see a Gooble Box from Rick and Morty 🤓
It makes me happy to see your progres time to time
Genius
juman
This guy rediscovered a manual turning machine, sowing machine etc.
Is this guy swiss? I feel like he is very swiss.
Dude that's insane... My brain sucks lol 😂
You've always been a mad scientist but this takes it to another level lmao
My son is super into gears and ratios!!! But I have been trying to figure out the CREATIVE applications for such interest. And BAM🎉 THERE YOU ARE🎉❤❤❤❤
That mad scientist laugh 😂
YOURE SO CLOSE!!!
I forgot about this person/channel until i just stumbled upon this. Impressive!
can you just finish the machine please?
Latest wintergaten music machine inspired this cycle.
Would a remontoire work for this purpose?
Why not just use a liquid vortex?
Man I wish you’d asked for help from the community I would have suggested treadle power a long time ago. I’ve made a few treadle wood lathes… also, you could have used the crank from a John Barnes Metal Lathe velocipede pedal system… also, there is a pretty solid mechanism in an old John Barnes machine called the Combination machine that uses a flywheel for constant consistent motion and a ratchet and pawl to crank… it free spins like a rear bicycle wheel until you pump it again… I bet if you put a centripetal governor on the flywheel like they used on old steam engines you could get consistent, smooth rotation. The treadle using a pitman link and LONG wooden arm allows you to take linear motion and turn it into rotary power… bevel gears are also your best friend.   Edit: I just saw that you used the exact kind of governor I was talking about 😂. Should have watched the whole short.
I absolutely love that you got your solution from James Watt
Sehr gut
lol at the Hofner bass
Please don't use those auto-translated ai voice audio tracks, they're horrible.
Bro has been complaining about uneven output for avout ten years now. Good work man
I feel like I'm inside Rick's car battery
I actually saw some of these mechanisms on display at the Boston Science museum. They were listed as being used to ensure the steady flow of fuel from a source, but they function here too.
LETSGOOOOO
How much longer untill someone realises this was a complete waste of time and effort?
👏👏👏👍
Its a "Gooble box" powered instrument.
Dude it's been 10 years...
you could also use a cam or a ratchet arrangement like in pendulum clocks to control your periods effectively
in summary...what he's doing is adding more weights away from shaft (flywheel) for creating high moment of inertia so that the kinetic energy changes is not reflected much in the varying speeds..
Congratulations dude!  :-)
Thats a flooblebox
If you're looking for a way to sterilize music, this is a good start.
If you just researched escapement system you would have solved this a lot earlier. An escapement is used in a watch and can be smoothed out using band belts.
Bro looks like my cat making muffins in the bed
I think the unevenness is what makes it music.
I think the unevenness is what makes it music.
REINCARNATED. IM A STARGAZER.
You are crazy! I love it! 😁👍
What about an escapement transmission?
You are amazing
Congratulations!!!!! Yet, the uneven nature of machine playing music is kinda s state of art itself! So please, make it... optional :D Всего Наилучшего, из РФии! <3
🎊 🎉
Yeah
Heavier larger flywheel can store a lot more energy then transfer to shaft even energy from human input.
Barely understanding what's really going on mechanically, I still love this so much ❤
Bro I cant fckin believe this. I think I still have your VDO saved on my playlist 🎉
Bruh, the flavor is in the syncopation 😂😂😂
I can already visualize this on your next machine. The pedals on the floor, you marching in place to provide the power, BOTH hands free to manipulate the switches and levers instead of one arm locked to turning the power crank.
that's dedicatiom
Reinventing the clock, not the computer.
Youman
WINTERGATAN. YOUR VIDEOS HAVE FOUND ME AGAIN!
Honestly, you could’ve just built a really big contraption with gears and pulleys and governors and I would’ve found it fascinating. I just like things that are mechanical, even if they don’t serve any real purpose.
Mechanical phase lock loop?
The older i get, the more i learn that engineers are truly the magicians of our world.
Wow, that’s a really complicated machine. Have you looked at how mechanical watches do this? The spring in a watch has the same basic issue, they use a single gear and flywheel (in a grandfather clock it’s a pendulum). It only counts out seconds, but adjusting the timing should be reasonably trivial.
Pure art! Congrats
This how guys look playing create mod
This already exists.
A mechanical rectifier... fascinating
Incredible
I love him being a crazy musical scientist
As an electronics tech, I would call this a mechanical, analog BRIDGE RECTIFIER.
the machine sounds like the King engine
That is so genius ... Absolutely flat. Without the use of a computer.
you solved the problem for millions of drummers to come!
Just use your powers for good, brother.
This is so unnecessary and SO cool!
I like the uneven sound of the original, just adds to the aesthetic
Bro made a full bridge rectifier
To be fair, I prefer the small tempo changes in "human music" that I think gave the original machine a human quality
How long until Martin realizes he wants the human factor in his music? 😂
Martin has unlocked the digital analog 😂
You made an over complicated crappy sounding drum machine. They’re super cheap on eBay and sound a lot better.
It’s just how automatic mechanical watches work 😂
I saw you about ten years ago with that music machine, I'll check in again in another ten
Mechanical wrist watches have done this for centuries
Hats 🎩 off ! You did it !!!
Automatic pianos have had something like this since the 1800s. Users would pump the pedals to make it play but the tempo remained consistent thanks to a built in regulator. I'm surprised no one in the last 8 told him about them.
dude built a cat biscuits power source
Marble machine 2 before gta 6
🔅🔆 No idea what you're doing,  but I like seeing smooth machines work.
My grandfather worked at a steam museum. Those governors are very familiar!
that's cool but the fluctuations in human tempo are actually expressive and important to music imho
The man basically created a metronome
The reason why music from before is better then now ....its because it shows feeling and not computerized shit like these days...
Awesome. So simple, but you have put all the hard-working to make it real. This is the subconscious coming into reality in a physical design. You just got to quit trying to break the fourth wall. That was creepy😂
The fly wheel spinning openly next to the pedals with corners still on gives me stress
This is so cool!
Don't make it too consistant.
A rectifier, so cool
I just realized that you sound a bit like Viktor From LoL arcane
Followed your journey. Very happy for you!
Bro looks like he hasnt slept in years. But it looks like it was worth it bud! Keep up the maddness its awsome
"TIGHTT TIGHHTT TIGHTTTT!. Yeah man bring those bings bops and thumps"
Obviously your interests are in engineering not music,  timing is feeling
steampunk vibes
Get a kitten on it
Physics does not matter to this plane 😂
use a spring
YOOO...rick and North car battery episode, dudes got the stepping peices the aliens were using to produce electricity
He's made a Gooblebox 😅
But this is the invention that makes Led Zeppelin sound boring, isn't it?
That laugh in the beginning told me everything
Dudes making biscuits
I’m glad you explained all this, because two seconds into the video I was convinced you were a mad scientist who has lost all touch with reality. Congrats on this creation.
Well done, you have replicated the output of a steam engine.
MEchanical Capacitor!
Isn't this ultimately a set of bike pedals?
And still, after all these years, I have no idea what this genius is doing.   Solution: This thing Problem: ?
Dude you made that amazing mqchine but took 8 years to come up with a flywheel?
I think drums sound better if they are not exactly in time… I remember reading this online someplace a quick google did not get me a good source
I still don't understand what I'm seeing here, but still very cool. Congratulations
I’m kind of impressed. But I stopped watching a while ago (the algo brought me this) and I fear that he’ll find another flaw with this too and then starts something else entirely.
Ah yes, my favorite: casually inventing a mechanical full bridge rectifier while attempting to make music.
man i also hate it when i accidentally reverse engineer a CVT
When did I unsubscribe?  YOUTUBE!!!
yes!
Congrats man!
Self paying pianos 100 years ago be like
Never thought I'd see a mechanical version of *FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER*
The laughter is in tempo, maybe a bit loose, but we're just going to call it syncopation 😂
Flugelcrank!
Wait he's the guy 7 years ago with the marble music, thats his First vid I watched and this is his second
One mystery solved.
8 years to do something that can be done in 2 weeks. Nice
But. I like the organic feel of the human inprecision..
Definition of "useless"
Congratulations!!!!
LETS GOOOOOOO
The intro reminds me of my cat making cookies while glaring at me for not giving him real cookies
I'm pretty sure you could have saved on the complexity by using a flat coil spring so it'd be able to keep a steady BPM rate like a watch or a toy monkey with the cymbals
So... this is almost like the old pianos with their playing sheets right?
Mechanical PID
Dude essentially reinvented a Prop Speed Governor
Player piano designers 100 years ago: you could achieve the same thing by just pump air in or out of bellows.
I made a lego racecar once,it was like fifty pieces, maybe more
Now add swing.
On behalf of everyone, I just want to thank whoever has been funding this dude to do whatever he wants for the last 10 years=D Much appreciated!!
Can't wait for it to be deemed terrible and thrown out.
Imagine a bicycle with a mechanism like this ❤
The sound of the machine seems sus
Now, shrink that down, make it lighter, and install it in some sort of bike or trike and see what kind of speed it achieves 🤔.
My guy made a mechanical *FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIEEER*
We solved that problem 21 years ago. Try to get in Triple 9 Society. You'll like what you find.
Much rather listen to the human version of the but I respect the mechanical work!
Now play freedom dive on it
Seek refuge in Allah, there is evil in your face
Damm not only my young version has been amazed by you but the old one now
Human = wants to build human powered musical instrument Also Human = Uses computers to accurately time human powered musical instrument. other human = Ask wtf didn't you just use a computer? other other human = "It's all about ART bleh bleh bleh" other human = Well some humans want to use a spoon to move a mountain for a railway....Guess which one I'M NOT!
Isn't that the Gooble Box from Rick and Morty
Why don’t you just call it swing and be done with it?
This is the same tech as in pianosI don't need a person to play
I think Alan Watts made this invention in the 1800ds, atleast used it . That contracting and expanding thing (Proportional valve control ) anyways good stuff
That insane dark haired bearded drummer dude doesn't have this problem
I think this guy has lost his marbles                 You get it lost his marbles😂😂
guy made the gooblebox from the battery episode of rick and morty
The stomp box with a wind up like a toy is what i imagine but this is awesome engeinering go you man sound off!
Mechanical rectifier
I remember showing my parents the marble machine video when i was like 8 and here you are still at it!! keep up the great work!
you looked so much like a cat making cookies operating that pedal ahhaha
Evil laughter 😂
What is that filament?
Bro just make a mechanical full bridge rectifier
This man is actually going insane, he will never stop, he will never be done, he will never be satisfied, he is going to die building this machine
Bro fr hooked us up with the thingamajig
Better than any anime arc
As an EE taking notes.
I still believe!
😱
Who gonna say it
That's a lot of internal torque on tiny bearings! Average leg power is 50W
How do you adjust the bpm?
he never work in factory when he made machines that make sound of machines
Speak out against Elon Musk because you've been quoting and fawning over him for years. Either align yourself against him or your cowardice and complacency is what shows through.
Bro made a mechanical Graetz bridge 😅
Still the marble machine is superb 😂
This guy is gonna inadvertently make HEX from the discworld at some point and it's gonna be great.
最近日本語字幕ついてて嬉しい
Congratulations tiniverse, now you can make your macroverse.
Sorry I cant listen to the automatic translation. pls turn it off! I can not change to the original soundtrack in shorts
THE MARBLE GUY
This is incredibly cool but it got me thinking of how far one would actually want to smooth out the rough parts of your machine. The inconsistencies and small variations are what makes your music yours and why a lot of people prefer actual instruments over digital samples. The more you "optimize" the music making process the more you cut out the characteristics of the instruments and the people playing. At the end of the day it's all personal preference of course and as said, still an amazing accomplishment, but was just a thought I had
Congrats and all, but who really cares about that machine anymore? You should have done other great things, you're clearly very capable!
Isn't that like what a player piano uses?
Amazing work 👏
Make sure you get sleep too. You look tired.
"not quite my tempo"
Yes
I think a more compact device could be a magnetic coupler (the Eddy current disk one)
Doesn't a player piano already do this?
It's funny that Martin started MMX project hoping to finish it in like 1 or 2 years or so, but he's basically studying engineering with a very specific emphasis in marble machines, and sharing it with us, so he can actually have the perfect machine at the end. This is amazing. I followed the progress for a long time but stopped for external reasons, I'll start watching the episodes again from where I stopped. At least I still remember the whole progress haha
One of the best videos on yt!
Congrats for re-inventing something invented 137 years ago
congratulations, you made a remontoire clock mechanism.  Seriously, look it up, pretty cool.
YOUUR HIIM!!❤
bro reinvinted constant speed drives
That sounds wrong, like something or someone is beating sonething and let’s just say that something…
You should just use the vaccum bellows from a player piano or somthing to that effect, no matter how fast you pedal them they keep the same tempo
Looks like the speed governor for a steam engine.
Nah bro thats shit from Ostatni Stroiciel Oktawonu 💀💀💀
Varför trodde jag att det var Joel från ijwtbc först😭 du gör bra videos sluta inte🙏
Eh, Not quite my tempo. Were you Rushing or Dragging?
Hmmm I remembered hearing that player pianos used vacuum bellows to solve this problem, once you get vacuum it's just vacuum, you can't drift significantly lower and air pressure is generally pretty consistent at a particular altitude, you could therefore drive a vacuum pressure based drive, sort of like a piston engine but with power on the pull stroke.
You solved a problem humanity solved 100 years ago. Now you sound like a mashine congrats but people invented soundblaster in the 90s. But you do you i supose.
Is this still about that marble macine? It has been years since the last time i wacthed them
Damn, I love that you still make videos, love it! Watch you from that famous vid! And start re watching from a year ago!
It's nice that it is even, but now it won't have funk
A word of warning: a part of the GREAT thing with your music is that the un-evenness of your music, while really tight and good, being still inconsistant enough to hear, so it is ORGANIC, while being Mechanic. If you make it too perfect, it will loose the soul that is Vintergatan! Hugs and love from one of your fans!
I’m glad someone finally found a “modern” use for flywheels!
Youre gonna go crazy building the same thing over and over again...
isnt that what a torque converter does?
That's some Gooble Box technology! 🖕🏼 "Peace among worlds!" 🖕🏼
Is this like one of those fake energy videos or what???
Dj igor drop the bass
Give this to a cat when it’s in the middle of making biscuits too
…… so now he’s cheating.
The final boss of messing around with gizmos and doodads
You're still here after all these years. Keep going man.
Jeez, It's been 8 years?....Stap...STAAAP
didnt old autoplay piandos use a suction transmission to regullate the imput to a set speed for the sheet music?
Instead of gears why not use the viscosity of a fluid to transfer torque? I think cars use it if I don't remember incorrectly to control the spin of wheels from different sides for turning (left vs right sides)
seeing this after the air powered auto key player for pianos
Best example of never let them know utmr next move😂
You're that guy in Zelda OoT with his music box
If Eric Forman were an engineer
so when i want mentronome when my pc-mouse is broken to enable one i just to have big stone circle in house xd
??so you created a metronome
I think that human element isn't a problem and what's makes music better and not robotic
ahhh yes, finally an instrument I can play
So you just made a mechanical quantizer
:( These videos makes me so damn sad. I remember getting excited for the MMX literally 10 years ago. I remember the first time he made a video about the tempo not being "tight" enough and disassembling months of work. I remember his worry that the machine needs to work without flaw for an entire show, even though realistically you could pickup marbles or rearrange them between songs.  This man has gone down a very dumb rabbit hole, so far away from the music. The next marble machine will never get made because he will still be over-engineering the support legs or something.
Drummer here.  You just can’t keep strict time.
For percussion this works well enough, using a centrifugal clutch to control speed like a 1700's Dutch windmill. For brass or wind instruments you could use an air chamber with a pressure relief valve into a baffle.
Oh wow, i remember watching your original video when it first went viral. Cool to see that you're still at it n_n keep going, friend
This guy is literally min maxing. Amazing!!!
bro took a full bridge rectifier and made it mechanical
Every time you say govenor I hear britney spears.
It's an AC to DC inverter with a weight capacitor and an analog feedback governor. No switching needed cause there is no semistate nor loss.
🫡
Victory ... it tastes as sweet as lingonberry jam!
Im not so sure that removing the human touch is a good thing. Your original video was so good because it was organic.
So cool dude!
I’m a little skeptical about this, I’ve noticed that when whoever makes music tries and makes a song as perfect as possible it ends up sounding off and a little boring
Who's fappin in the background.
going from a flat face to the fake laugh at the beginning of the video is hilarious
Make something to generate electricity and then connect it to a motor with a capacitor, and then crank the generator thing you made
Look all I ask is that the new marble machine performs the song the original one did.
this is not a hate comment!  do you ever do research before inventing a whole thing from scratch? i feel like most of your problems are already solved, i can understand if you just NEED to do it yourself, i have the same mind, but sometimes you need to stand on the shoulders of giants
Excited to see what next 😂❤❤
Dudes working to become the Governor, of music
Engineer: This Historian: Metronome
The bellows on self-playing pianos function in a similar way, regulating the pedals to supply a constant and consistent stream of air to play the keys
Để làm gì😂 có ích gì cho con người😂
player pianos back in the day did this with a pneumatic pressure regulator but I guess that's not steampunk enough for these things
"That just sounds like slavery with extra steps."
This is why the Internet and YouTube exist.
That laugh was devious 😅
love that hes still doing this
woo-hoo! you invented hot water. that thing exists for decades. talk to some tailors.
If Martin didn't try to reinvent everything and instead combined existing solutions from the start into the machine he wanted, the marble machine world tour would be through right now...
I've said this before and I will say this again.  "Just let the aspies aspie!"
First of all a fantastic amount of effort and understanding of engineering principles.  However ask the question do humans enjoy the difference or do they prefer consistency?
The way it looks, it reminds me of old pump organs that play themselves. Very interesting of use of mechanics
Looks like a cat making biscuits. Love it!!
The mad scientist is back! Yeay
Is it made for cats?
Keep it up!
But the real question is why would you want to build this? The best part of music is the small imperfections that make it human.
Humanism sounds best though.
crazy - talmudic is a scam
ITS THE GUY FROM THE VIDEO THEY SHOWED EVERYONE IN YEAR 3!!!!
Pulse width modulation.
i love this madman
The first couple seconds of the video he looks like a cat kneading bread
They used governer mechanisms similar to this in early spring driven gramophones
Cat massage instrument
still not the painter of the mona lisa
Is this what you call a "Music Engineer" ?
is this an analog full bridge rectifier
That's the technology of a self playing piano from the 1800s.
Oh wow is that steam punk musician😮
Wow. This dude is still at it.
awesome, you can make it sound like an iphone app
I heard the rhythm, saw the machine, saw the face, read the channel name, happiness.
GIVE ME A SECOND I, I NEED TO GET MY STORY STRAIGHT, MY FRIENDS ARE IN THE BATHROOM GETTING, HIGHER THAN THE EMPIRE STATE
the laugh of mad scientist
uneven or not you made amazing music I think about all the time
Mad scientist laugh. 🎉 ❤  very exciting , cool work, long in the making!!!
Now remix It. 😅
you're kind of like Davinci
Is this guy Devin Townsend’s brother?
Bro just reinvented the player piano gear train, lol
How did he do that without ones and zeros?
The satisfaction that shot through his head when he laughed 😂 yes bro ❤✓ Dopeeee
When are we gonna get another concert from you in the USA?
It’s a flooblecrank
Wow... that governor was quite literally balls out! (That's where the phrase comes from since they used to have these on old machinery).
Enhorabuena por haber conseguido tu objetivo. Pero la imperfeccion humana a la hora de interpretar de llama talento. Y la perfección mecanica a la hora de interpretar se llama pianola. De todas maneras construyes unos artilugios admirables. Felicidades
Player pianos ha this solved a hundred years ago
You show what humans can be capable of. 👍
What is this nonsense
The mad scientist is back! 😂🤩🤍
The maniacal laugh... how Bond villain-ny.
It’s good to have a passion. You fucking did it boyyy nice
I mean.. You know those automatic piano playing bellows? They had a *very* similar gearbox system for even speed no matter the amount of pressure in the system input. I think the earliest "Player Piano" was from the late 1800s :)
So you borrowed from wind turbines or they need to borrow from you
I have no idea why this is so awesome, but I know it is.
Keep going man, innovate
great mad scientist laugh ;D
You can "hear" victory
Why didn't you just use pneumatic regulator like they used for the timing in those old self-playing pianos?
Love your creative ingenuity. But don't forget that those tiny imperfections that humans make are what adds soul into music. It's the difference between the warmth of jazz and the sterile precision of synthesizers.
You don’t understand. The mistakes is what make Metal sound good.
THE KING IS BACK, THE KING IS BAAAAAAAAACK
That crazy @$$ laugh 😂😂😂
So just another 10 years for Marble Machine X2? 😂
👏👏👏
master baiter machines
8 years pass, sir u old 😅
FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER!
It’s cool as hell….. but dude your just reinventing a computer 😂
congrats you just made a giant watch
And you get to power it like a cat making biscuits!
You should make more shorts. I watch shorts a lot and I fully watched this one enjoying it, thinking I know this guy from somewhere. Then I remembered the marble machine video and had a thought about all of the engineering that went into it. Truly fascinating, Id really enjoy more videos like this. Also perfectly cut, very informative and just generally awesome to see you build this.
Next: How I developed a machine that solved my UMAN problems
Why do you look like that junkie from Breaking Bad? The guy Walter confronted about buying the wrong stuff to make meth?
I love your music machine! Especially noticed the way that you touch it. It's really quite beautiful.  ❤🎉
Dam nice
This problem was solved over 100 years ago inside the player piano, which was powered by foot operated bellows, but then plays evenly and on tempo.
No one think that uneven may be the machine music soul ?
so its going from an instrument to a machine
Good to see you again
This world needs more mad scientists like this...
Good to see you again.
OH MY GOSH I REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR AWESOME MUSIC MACHINE
Creepy looking guy
Who else has only seen the original video and now this? Well I guess I know what I’m going ti spend my next couple days with, just filling the gap
Creep
If you want even power, why don't you just use a motor and get rid of human inaccuracy that way? A mechanical musical instrument gets its soul from the inaccuracy of the human or driving mechanism that operates it, at least in my opinion. For me, the first Marble Machine got its charm that way, and with what you're trying now, you might as well use a MIDI-controlled system, which could play even tighter music—but that would also make it lose its soul
It’s crazy I literally just rewatched that video yesterday it always blew my mind really cool to see it again
There’s a similar system found on old pedal powered paper roll piano machines
ah yes the first automatic transmission instrument
Мужик создал колесо, которое равномерно стучит и радуется :|
Can't you just buy a metronome?
his motion is what my cat does half the day, he seems happy too.
There was a beauty to an of sync beat made by human, but there also beauty to mechanical automation, just a different type of beauty 😂
Peek Overengineering xD
Rick would be proud!
get someone to make a patent out of it. Wind turbines could really use that
so he built a goobleboxe?
Eres un prodigio ❤
That's amazing. To rediscover the knowledge by yourself.
Why don't you try using your knowledge in a project obviously related to what you're doing: creating a hybrid electric-human powered vehicle. And even instead of storing energy in batteries, it would be possible to store pedal energy in a pressurized air tank that would run a compressed air engine to propel the vehicle.
I drum like a metronome so not sure why you say humans are uneven. Maybe its just you...
Early steam engines had similar problems and handled it in similar ways.
I've been told that my shaft moves fast , it makes a similar sound too.
Thankyou 🇵🇭💚
I never trust those gouvernors. Even Sir Arnold Schwarzenegger was a gouvernor. Why do technical machines got those stupid names? Yanks are weird.
Mechanical Quantization is cool as heck.
Basically, you want a torque converter used to link two engines to one output shaft.  Hydraulics
It's funny, B. Dylan Hollis just did a video on a c.100yo player piano that also solved this issue quite ingeniously  (I might have the age of the piano wrong)
thats why you can tell a synth from an actual band
Is this just a crappy drum machine or am I missing the beat
Yeah lost interest after you scrapped the new marble machine cool that you’re still active though
Dude I found you! After so many years
Bro made a gooble box
Is this basically a filtering circuit?
Simply use human strength to raise a weight, like a clock weight and that sets the tempo. Also, like a bagpipe.
what i see. someone find a time machine
ARE YOU LEADING OR ARE YOUR TRAILING
anyone remember when he made music...?
you can use this to produce lots of power and i think this will help in the electrical department
And now I want to see and hear  how you use this victory 🎉. what are you're up too! I can't wait to hear more !
I’ve been following you since the first video and I LOVE this project! I also LOVE the dedication you have!
Why ❓🤪
There's also the automatic piano player from decades ago that uses a foot pedal vacuum to suck air at a steady rate through holes. Regulator keeps foot pedals constant
🎉🎉🎉 He did it!!!! Such a breakthrough!!!!🎉🎉🎉
yay! more vids please!
Bro’s making biscuits
My knowledge of Torque is limited, but I believe more teeth smooths it out ( unless anyone wants to correct me )
behold, the human cat biscuit maker-anator
Yeah it's called the player piano it's been done
My man's idea is just a gooble box. xD
This guy is pretty creative and good with his hands. Would like to see him have access to all kinds of cool tools. He'd be an awesome addition to the blue man group. Get patents!!!!
Making Sweden proud🇸🇪
In x2 marbles where the problem, and not the tempo. It is hard to jump in to it when you're changing everything every few years and nothing gets finished. Only finished projects matter. There are Plenty of genius engineers not finishing the projects, including me :), and so far You are one of them (except X1 :))  Regards.  I hope this time world tour will happen (I do not mind hick ups) everything is a part of experience. Regards Again
AWESOME! 😳💖🙌😺
Quantization is creeping in the corner
I find the imperfections of music makes it human.  This is pretty dope mechanically speaking
To be honest, a mad musical genius powering the machine front and center was at least three quarters of the MM's charm
The king engine
A true analog synthesizer
Looks like something a who would play
Nice to power a pedal bike, smooth rider!  Using a Governor is brilliant! It used to to maintain steam engines running at a steady pace and not overspeed.  Brilliant
Very happy for you 💛🎉🐳🐳🐳🐳
the mechanical machine is also uneven.
Assume
How much useable kinetic energy is lost to all of these intervening contraptions?
What happened to you?
You just need a heavy flywheel!
T this this point I ithink that it's not about building the machine but to drain your supporters wallets as long as they believe in this shit for as long as you can, because if it goes like this the imagined "perfect" machine ain't gonna exist in the next 20 years.
Tbh I liked the irregularities that made it feel like music to me. But I think the story of the machine was part of its charm, and all your years of work into the new one will be part of its charm.
Where do the bike chains go?
This dude is smarter than me, but these are my thoughts. The goal of a controlled energy release immediately made me think of a mechanical watch. The main spring stores the energy and the escapement mechanism releases the energy slowly and evenly to keep time.   So as long as there is enough energy input, regular or not, the energy output can be stabilized.
I would use air pneumatics, but that would defeat the point of a mechanical drive train.
Dude made a flooble box
This is brilliant! 😂❤
Dude, this system was perfected over a 100 years ago!! Haven't you ever seen a wind up record player from Brunswick? They have a very small spring power unit that is charged by winding. The governor is small, precise and beautiful,  and can be regulated for speed/pitch when playing records.
All you need is a heavy fly wheel.  All that other crap is pointless.
OMG he’s back!!
Impressive lol
I would like to know how did you make the gears? The material, and how, they're double helical! Why not single helical as of the shaft?
he did it
I lost a finger just watching this
Steve BuschRPMi
You have several bodyparts to dig perfectly to different types of music. Enjoy!
There are so many useful implications outside of Wintergaten
This guy is a Mad Musical scientist GENIUS!!!
As an electrician my first thought was a motor, a generator and a capacitor
The human powered sounds better, even though its off tempo, the machine keeps everything in time.
Watching Martin knead those pedals like a content cat is something else XD
This is amazing
You also get those earbuds in to?
Uneven is good tho and you and change on the fly
So I made a universe, Morty, and now it powers my car. And inside that universe, they have a society, and inside that society, there’s a scientist who invents a little thing called ‘electricity’
Have you checked into old ragtime piano mechanisms ? I think they have a built-in mechanical regulator to play the song at cobstant rate even with a variable human power input ;)
I love an engineering solution to an artistic problem.  Also the sound at the start sounds like the King Engine from one punch man.
The CCP would like to buy your invention
Your Are Mad!  so Wha... EVERY GENIUS WAS LABELLED AS MAD AT SOME POINT!!! :salute:
that was 8  years ago?
this is so cool
A channel about how a dude turned from a musician into an engineer
We should really keep fighting the drug problems in our countries 😜
Can we be friends?  You accomplished one of my life goals already.  I want to copy your homework to proceed with my ideas.
I'm so very very impressed you keep working on that thing!
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't they solve this issue already in the vacuum powered automatic pianos, there was a mechanism that turned the paper that kept it at a steady rate no matter the rhythm that the operator pumped the pedals.
Blind people listening this video at the start💀
I hope this man finish this machine during one lifetime. At least my lifetime. I'm 32
and this here is my doohickeyinator
ну с таким маховиком как у тебя, помоему не только ритм выровнять, но и вечный двигатель можно получить ненароком... :-)))
I encountered a similar problem when I needed to synchronize my friends' previously recorded hand-drumming with my own drum machine playing in a sound editor. then the soundtrack of my friends' uneven playing did not coincide with the drum machine for more than 2..3 beats in a row, and it lost simultaneity, was out of phase with the drummer's moment, then I took a sample of manual drumming, loaded it into an editor called Cool Edit, and in it, selecting sections of 2 beats with the mouse, stretched them to the missing length corresponding to a deliberately slightly slower rhythm, Cool Edit is a wave file editor that allows you to easily select sections of the recording with the mouse, stretch them in time without changing the tonality, naturally this effect involves digital transposition to compensate for the changed duration of the digitization, so some artifacts are expected, familiar to everyone when playing YouTube at a speed twice as changed, for example, but with a small change made separately for short clusters of the sound track, they are not noticeable, this type of distortion is quite pleasant for the ear, reminiscent of reverb... even fashionable today in electronic music, "Shulman - NN3" for example
It was the Eureka laugh for me
I know its a bit of a hindsight comment but surely could have looked at how watch/clock mechanisms achieve this, and effectively just made a large version of a mainspring which with a correctly adjusted escapement creates perfectly timed rhythmic mechanical movement no matter how fast or slow the mainspring is wound, its dependant on the escapement
Full bridge rectifier
I just want my shaft spun at a constant rpm
Man i want this guy to design me a bicycle
SO THIS IS WHAT YOUVE BIN DOING?! you're more mechanic then musician at this point 😂😂😂
Have you solved the problem? Go look at old self playing pianos, the problem has already been solved, note all mechanics u are using have already been done genius
Get a job
What is this?
How does it work?
So the original video was fake then? Or, "edited" as suspected?
Its crazy because I didnt even realize Ive been following this invention for 8 years lol. TY for inspiring me to make unique instruments <3
Mad scientist
Creepy dude
Thats beautiful
And in another 8 years he will create a marble AI xD
I was sure he'd be done by now. Jesus Christ
Someone needs to go back through all the videos and count up all the "I finally figured it out" titles.
After 12 years, you’re still here I’m surprised keep going.
Free energy on a pedal pump nice
Use a pendulum and an escapement mechanism. A big watch.
reminds me of mechanical watch
Step on⁶he needs to step on it like Rick and morty
I love detektivbyran and wintergatan
Congratulations my dude!!!!!
But why?
this is incredible!
My cat used to do the same thing with the hands.
holy crap you’re still working on that thing⁉️ I remember watching a video of you playing it 24/7 when I was 4 😭 I’m 13 now
a full power rectifier! ask ElectroBOOM!
That's sick!❤
ow boy another eurovision wierdo.
since whe ndo vminecraft villigers laugh
It's funny how this pops up for me not too long after a short featuring a hundred year old machine using this technique to make an automatic piano sheet player.
A "good" (enjoyable) drummer smoothens his energy output by practice. The remaining faults of his performance make his beats human and engaging to listen to. A "perfect" (mathematical) beat feels unnatural and boring to the human ear. This isn't news though. Sorry to tell you, but you should have just practiced handling that crank. (If you're a musician and knew all along I'm sorry. No smartassing intended.)
Just use your electric motor and connect it's shaft with the wheel and also to a transformer 😂 problem solved
Félicitations
But the thing is the uneven are the ones what make music unique unlike soulless machine sound
I remember watching this thing in primary school. Our music teacher showed us this. Now I'm at the University and this guy continues working on it... For so many years... That's what dedication looks like
The efitoincy is abslut trash
Mechanical quantiser, all the recording studios had them in the 1800s'
Cool
Amazing. Imagine the world that we live in when 8 year work should be represented in a minute video to get the widest recognition possible!
Can we get the government workers to repeatedly walk on this to get a constant 50/60hz
Okay. At first ... i liked the marble machine things and so on ... But really. PLEASE put off this annoying bad ugly auto-translation-thing from youtube. Its absolute horrifying and i can't disable it on shorts ... Its so pain in my ears ...
he looks evil
I don't even know wtf I'm looking at
You kinda look like a Rick and Morty character keep it up
Wait ‘til he hears about MIDI…
I dint get it. What is the point of going backwards in technology... You are u condensing what modern day software does...
I don't know what the hell you're saying, but I'm enjoying every second.
It’s difficult to explain but isn’t someone playing not perfect but unique like someone pretty cool
Ozzy
Is this a full bridge rectifier?😃
Good to see this guy again, awesome
Hand crank car is now possible?
I still dont know where it is.
This guy looks like he could engineer anything
I was a kid, when I saw the first video.
not an Evil Genius AT ALL i'm sure
You’re weird
Ever thought of just loading a washer machine incorrectly? Much easier I think
You are my hero
Anytime I see that old machine I can no longer hear the original song. It's just tachyon now.
I thought it was for producing energy😅😅
Youre brilliant
Bro made a diode bridge for humans
This is the device from inside ricks car battery
He resembles a cat massaging the bed.
He built a Flooble crank for his miniverse
Oh my god! This is the craziest update in 2025
Watchmakers solved this centuries ago no? Much less complex. Simplicity is everything
Firt though i think you're making kendrick's beat
Fianlly i can remember someone name from history book who invented something new😅
So you're going to all this effort to make a music machine but you want it to run like a quantized daw? I saw the point of making a human powered organic machine but when you take all the variability out of it... Computer that you wind.. I don't get it?
He want to make a marble machine but transformed into a mechanical engineer.
TOSS YOUR DIRTY SHOES🗣️🗣️
This is so very epic! I feel like such a nerd now holy crap 😂
The goal is to make a single song ipod the size of a portapotty and weighs in at 200lbs using minimal human input  AND with almost no electricity
Bro make some more cool shit.
Keep upgrading eventually you'll get a computer lol
The king engine?
You've gotta consult real engineers. I hear you have a dozen "idea guys" but very few people who actually know what they're doing
Idek what hyperbolic means bro
You're the only musician Im aware of that is also a hardcore mechanical engineer. Cool stuff.
Yep mechanical governor is key here keeping that flywheel at a constant RPM, today we use electronic governors.
Is this thing still going on
I would use the human to charge the battery that powers the motor😊
cant a computer do this?
Like a capacitor with electricity
I cant believe Wintergatan is still at it, Ifirst saw that marble machine video 7 years ago and it was legendary
When the bard multi classes into artificer
"Let's listen to the machine playing" Mr. Sandmaaaaan
I'm so happy for you.
Amazing that you keep on working in this. great job!
Spin the shaft 😍🥴🤤
Impressive
I had fogrot about you
Smooth it out with fluid torque convertors and clutch slippage.
I teach middle school science and he’s been around with this machine since I started teaching. I always show it to my students every year. I love the engineering and creative passion for this project doesn’t leave him.
Hey, please stop creating more masterpieces, we can't afford enough appreciation for all your creations.
Oh snap he's back! Haven't seen this guy in a long time. Glad he stuck around
Long time not see you brother, glad you okay
You look like a cat making biscuits XD
That's called crypto trading
Doubtful
Waiting for the music to happen.
my goodness. magnifique
you mean ... same as a watch. ...nothing new
This was around since the 1890s sorry my dude but pianos have been doing this for longer than a century.😂😂😂
Don’t try to act smart . Your music barely carries a beat . Leave it there.   You’re special because mom said so.
I’m sorry did someone make a flint stone powered car engine?
Wow 😲.. that's insane.. & awesome 😎👍
I love tihs so much! I also loved the human touch to Marble machine! BUT I LOVE THIS SO MUCH TO!!!!!! KEEP GOING!!!
this is absolutely amazing your problem solving is absolutely amazing.
he made a gooble box
This is awesome, great work dude
Hey to help fund your music enterprise you should design a bike. I'm serious
Cant wait for the next marble song
This is incredible 🙌🙌 shout out 117 master chief 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Congratulations you invented a sowing machine
I believe some of the first auto playing pianos still needed human to use a foot pedal and had a mechanism to makes sure a drum spun at same speed no matter input speed
Wait, I remember seeing that marble machine years ago
What does victory taste like?
I remember seeing it the first time and it great to see you still working on it hope to see it finished while I am still in school
Lars Ulrich: WHAT IS THIS
The algorithm knew. The other day I was thinking about this guy and the contraption he built. Glad to see it
I have rewatched that first video so much, what I like about it is that it had that human element that made it sort of imperfect. I look forward to what you accomplish with this new work
Now we shall wait for the sequel of that video (it was great)
Music engineer Musician and engineer
Balls out
I downloaded the free vst3 and it's so shit
Doesn’t the pianola have one
first song was still amazing, even with uneven input
too big to be practical, needs streamlining
As someone who dabbled in making things I can only imagine how much work that took. Always countless problems pop up you never could have even imagined
Be careful. Some of us are remote viewers. We look for "stugff"
REINCARNATED  I'M A STAR GAZER 10 TOES IN I NEED ALL MY BABIES
But isn't it the human element that made the marble machine song so unique?
Rube Goldberg for musicians lol.
the doohickey is operating at max efficiency
This is Nuts Dude
America getting the jets ready 🛫  US: Oh it’s for music… right.
still one of the coolest yt channels ever. keep going bro<3
It looks like a cat making muffins
you should collab with the Human Powered Flight guys
Love it
I fucking love you martin I'm so so glad you have never abandoned this project
Nerd.  Cool stuff!
I can't believe you're still doing this
Flyball governor is brilliant,  elegant,  and cool to see, the perfect accompanying device for your machine.
You can taste victory when you look into history and see that clock escapements do the same thing…
Laughing like a true mad scientist
as an electrical engineer student, I would convert the pedal motion to electrical signal, feed into an operational amplifier comparator with hysteresis with a monostable multivibrator to convert the uneven hand motion into an even electrical signal. I would then feed the output to a stepper motor which would drive the handle.
117...master chief is everywhere
Hes using knipex tools. Thats how you hes the real deal.
Martin: *playing a beat* Also Martin: "The human..."
You need like a stairmaster/stepper where you stand on it and put a constant weight on the paddles.
The most consistent man I know
Now make sure this can be passed along,  oh did youtube cus genenetics werent looking to good? Perfect! Using tech gets a +2 on your saving throw! 😁
Its like a 100yr old player piano
I get the achievement but on the other hand **glances at metronome.** nevermind.
This is brilliant engineering music.
Good for you. We need it to be more soulless.
Schlaganfall content
This dude still tinkering with his marble machine. Amazing he's stuck it through and keeps going
When I see you in the beginning of this video, all I see is a cat kneading a blanket. The eyes are the same.
bro if your power is uneven doesnt mean its a problem for humans in general :D like saying all are dumb just cus u are dumb
"Youman"? What's a YOUMAN?
When your music instructor says “Not quite my tempo”
Reminds me a little of the Seiko spring drive.
Bro
I thought it was a scary video until he laughed 😂😂😂😂
that larger machine I am always so worried about how spindly the legs are
I used to watch the marble video on loop on my school Chromebook
adapted a flyball governor to it eh? that's different.
Omg man you're back! Keep it going this is my favorite music machine🎉
This was solved by player pianos of the 1800's without all of these components.
No way!!!! Brother I loved the first machine!!! I cant wait for the next one!
Player pianos have regulated music speed for more than 100 years....
partty!!!
That's cool! ❤
Amazing. Respect for the passion and goals achieved!!!
Can’t wait to see the finished thing
like an automobile transmission?
I remember when i listened your music all the time
I cant believe this dude is still workig on this thing
Please make music again real soon.
Oh, okay.
Maybe the human imperfection drving it is what make the sound oh that machine so special.
Bro used time.DeltaTime irl
you could have also solved the problem with a pair of bellows and adjusting the output so it is constant ;) would be a bit simpler and was already done in pianos long ago :D
An Automatic watch also works in the way that it gives the Energy evenly. Couldnt that be a solution too?
Where am i
if this continues, hes going to create an artificial wooden musician lifeform, before finishing this instument.
I liked the way it was
İt shouldent be that hard actualy. Buts still your mechanism is prety good. Very simmalar and problebly cheap. 1: One Way gear 2: Spring Thing (Start) 3:""(End) 4:Repeatable 5:Cluch 6:Break
in other age you woulkd be nazi scientis
Old piano...
wtf did I just watch lol I liked it tho
Hahaha man you are using modern tech to solve archaic problems. Invent and create my friend, you are there.
The R&D on their way to weaponize this for fun:
He did it!!!!! We've all been waiting anxiously for this day to finally arrive🎉🎉🎉🎉
good work
If you take humanity out of music it is no longer music. Pitch correction is a prime example.
Ah shit time to binge wintergatan again
Dude made a flywheel out of flywheels
Why not an energy storing spring or weight and an escapement mechanism like a mechanical watch ?
Dude! I watched your videos in middle school band! Holy shit this is cool!
Tbh the flywheel was an genious idea, congrats for the contraption!
Wooo
Omg I remember this guy from ages ago 😭
Spanking machine
Nice bit of gabber there Wintergarden!
When you say human you really just mean you lmfao do you think musicians can't hold a rhythm
Player painos work this way exactly lol
aaah the gearwheels even the input power out! :D
Few seconds in: 😠😠😠😀😀😀
I honestly thought he gave up on this.
After 8 long years you finally did it
Why so complicated? You just need to store and release energy. Basically what a common capacitor does. Not so difficult to do that mechanically.
Wouldnt it be simpler if you just spun something to charge a battery, and then it spun a motor off of that? Maybe thats missing some nuance
one day this dude will learn about electricity, it will blow his mind
Next, he invents the wheel.
Are you German?
Omg you are such a legend keep it going 🎉❤🙌🏽
there was a technology  over 100 years ago   its the self playing piano   dosnt matter how hard you  pedal down to get the sucktion   it was having a way to get   the same speed evrytime dosnt matter how fast you was pedaling
It's called a bike
and its all fucking mechanical thats crazy not a single arduino in sight
Bro made a mechanical rectifier. This is ridiculously impressive
I was just watching a video about one of those automatic piano players (that use the long sheets of paper with holes and works on compressed air), and those have something similar, you have to work the bellows for the air by hand but they have a mechanism that keeps the timing of the playing consistent regardless of how fast you’re going.
That's a great "mad scientist" laugh.
bro built a mechanical capacitor
Mom: He will be a musician Dad: No! He will be an Engineer Son:
В обычном патефоне подобная система.
It's been years since I listened to your marble machine song during the afternoons I really thought you would never do anything like that again what a pleasure to see you again, I'm attentive to your content. See u later 🎉
HES BACK
Holy shit its JoJo McDodd
Finally lol, been watching off and on for the past few years
Stay awesome sir 😀
Wintergatan marble machine was beautiful though because of its flaws.
but isnt it a bit more pleasing to human ears to have just a little bit of deviation in music? like how it feels more natural and pleasant to listen to a song played by humans rather than a song thats just continuously perfect inputs?
I still say techno jeep beats this
A) I love tempo-fluid music, and the original marblemachine performances are amazing B) still a great mech innovation, velocity smoothing.
cat biscuit machine simulator?
8 years flew by so quick.
AC to DC converter
i thought you were making a pedal powered helicopter 😂
i remember seeing one of those automatic piano things and it had a similar thing to coverting un even power to even power so yeah
Every great inventor "now to get rid of the human power input"
Wouldn't a pressurized mechanism have been much easier, smaller and with less moving parts, meaning less energy wasted? Use the human power to fill a pressurized container, the air releasing from the container at a steady rate no matter how unevenly you are filling it, would allow you to control the timings.  This is the principal of those ancient western saloon automatic pianos.
Congratulations you invented an accumulator
I thought it was stroking the drum stick and it said go faster and slow down 😂😂😂
Damn this is deep
No way is this like a full bridge rectifier
So useless
I now understand why this is the theme on the darkhorse podcast
Your maniacal laughter tells me everything I need to know. You have done an extraordinary job, and are deservedly proud of your creation, you should be, it lives Beautifully.
Kind of reminds me of those old pianos with the bellow actuators. There was some kind of system that the person could pedal at variaous speeds but the music would play with correct timing.
...  a human rectifier?
I love you wintergagtan
Seriously quit wasting your time and buy a goddamn drum machine
If you want mechanical perfection, just open up a daw at this point.
You are a true Leonardo Da Vinci! I love your marble instrument/machine.
What about just making the actuator hydraulic? Each press would send equal pressure to both wheels without all the additional gears.
i hope  ur ok
I swear they use this in a like automatic piano thing
Bagpipe
I wonder how long it will take for Martin to realize that plywood is not good enough and ditch it entirely...
Wasn't Singer doing this years ago? All he had to do was just buy an old, foot -powered sewing machine and repurpose the mechanicals 🙂  Jokes aside, this dude is still a bonafide genius.
Dude I was a kid when you started working on this and it’s just getting more high tech and more impressive
what was a good idea turned into a endless scam for views.  trying to take the music out of music the analog way. too bad he will NEVER finish this and just keep taking $
You heard him, fire your drummers boys.
Sounds like an AC DC conversion issue but harder.
I thought he was bill Gates for some reason 😭
Yess
Dude where does this thing go…. Your garage? Where do people keep these contraptions 😂
wintergrips 2
No way, congratulations! I hope new songs be ready soon! :O
“I can just taste victory, right here.” 😅 the way he said it was funny
Cool man wake me up when it’s done.
Flywheel. It's not complicated.
You can just attach a small motor that will give or take power depending on your small changes in rithem
I had always thought that the variance in tempo was part of the charm ... allowing more expressive movement while playing.
I watched your videos when I was on school, seeing this now grown makes me feel so happy for you!
This man is a genius in my eyes
Jesus loves you. Believe on Him, and you will be saved.
Man hes still at it amazing
So, an overly complicated metronome?
Bro this is rad. Good job
Can you play pasodoble?
Fell in love with the marble machine and can't wait to see this new one
Ahh.. the gooble box!
perfection finaly:-)
So is it like a cvv transmission?
Tbh, I really liked the variations in your music machine... it was very... human. 😊
Way to go dr. Doofinschmirtz! The tri-state area doesn't stand a chance against your even-output-inator!
A cat would love this machine, making biscuits all day
Mechanical watches, take human power input and release said power in near perfect time. You should look into watch making for this one.
Taste?…. LSD?
He basically made a musical gooble box
Why did I feel like taking off my clothes when you were looking at me in the beginning? I’m a straight, married 45yo dude and that was the seductive thing I’ve seen in YEARS. Also, awesome machine!
They had someone similar with self playing pianos.
This is ultimate level of autism, too much free time and money
It’s so annoying that YT will give me all sorts of crap in my feed but none of the channels I subscribe to. Every time I see a new video from this channel I feel like it’s a leap frog advancement the next one will be in space I swear. Haha Love the content
My guy still going strong with his creation. It's so satisfying to watch 😎
Bro, you’re still working on this???
Congratulations. You just invented the drum machine.
Holy shit you're still working on the thingamajig? It's been like 14 years or smthing man that's impressive
This is the type of sh*t my cat is thinking about when making biscuits
Un pequeño paso apa el hombre un gran paso aora al hormiga 😂😂😂
I think air pump system would have worked fairly easy and effective as well. Maybe implement some bit of that as a part of your powering unit?
Almost looks like a great start to a human powered car
as a musician i made the expirience that little flaws like not perfect beats makes the music sounnd much more alive. Perfect music, with perfect sync, perfect volume and perfectly hitting notes sounds way to artificial.
"NOT QUITE MY TEMPO🤬🤬🤬"....
Aye bro it's been years and he still on it, the dedication ☠️
tape the drmstick to the wheel
Like the vacuum piano (player piano)
Wait- is this for cars or drums?
wheres my mike portnoy fans
Your eyes are starting to look like Hugh Laurie's eyes on Season 6 of House.
Looks like something that belongs in a microverse battery.
That creepy German look. You damn terrific German engineers.
Mr Sandman...
I tried to do something like this years back but I just didn't have the money to make it. I was thinking maybe making something like that that can be used in vehicles so cars can do that instead of having to use gas.
Though it has been uneven, I have appreciated everything that you have produced.  Imperfections are what make an experience uniquely human, perfection is unnatural.
That flint stone flywheel is terrifyingly close to your hands.
It's called an escapement and it's been around for nearly 800 years. They got good in timekeeping devices in the 1700's. Neat device, but nothing new.
Mate you can use this to get electricity:O  Sure it might need some adaptations but I think this can actually make electricity at some point 😮
Dumb
"Flat" isn't always a good thing though lol. Especially for velocity changes and feel.
mechanical capacitor
Hey yoooo, I found your channel again after years. nice!
Good work🎉
I wonder if this is how they engineered watches back in the day. This looks like an oversized Rolex internals.
Ive regained my attention span and was able to leave youtube with your longer video thank you!
Giving Rick and Morty vibes 😂
This reminds me of the rick and morty episode where rick powers his car from tiny people in a battery
Ahh man.  Those human fluctuations put the soul in the music.
Forget music, let’s make POWER.
Manual metronome!
A toast to tasting victory ✌️
omg he created a electric circuit but with physical parts. amazing 🤝
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 ❤
Can you imagine how much trouble we'd be in if this guy wasn't so into music 😂😂😂
Bro made the GoobleBox from Rick and Morty!
Boi is slowly reinventing a player piano...👍
Old measuring devices, which had a hand-operated generator inside, had a similar design.  Clutch that smoothed the speed.  People either look at existing solutions or come up with it themselves ;)
So this is what my cat does on my bed.. Never thought that he was emulating an Engineer.
HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!! Man, I was watching this guy when I was still in JUNIOR school. -sincerely Uel
This guy still working this machine? Bruh 💀👏👏
Has anyone ever told you that you looked like one of the Weasley Twins.
It's awesome and I would like to see how you did it, but that said. Once this is achieved one wonders why you need a human source of power at all. Now the human is not doing anything more than providing energy, you can achieve the same with a motor that you activate just pressing a button.
Spring
The contraption
"Now it isss time to pet za monkey!"  Sorry, first thing to pop into my head.
Ur autism is showing but amazing stuff!!
Nice work
Bro built a FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER out of gears.
The mad laugh really sells how hard you've been working on that.
Practical artist is diabolical smart or diabolical notorious. This is awesome.
This has all been a cover for a particle accelerator and Anti-Matter weapon, hasn't it?
Amazing engineering feat but honestly organic tempo changes are a rare treat in this grid-centric age.
This is how you end up powering a car battery for Rick.
reminds me of rick's stomping2x thing to produce energy
To be honest though, the human version sounds better. Has more "soul" and warmth. Anything a machine creates is cold and lifeless.
Pretty sure: this is a major invention
Bro you made my childhood. I loved watching metal balls making music.
Bro just created a non electrical ac-dc rectification
I remember our teacher showing a video of your machine like 10 years ago, amazing
Copy the mechanism from an old vacuum actuated player piano. Those are like 150 years old.
...was a torsion spring too difficult? There seem to be a lot of extra points pieces here, and Im not sure why.
wow. i listened to your music a decade ago. its incredible seeing you still working on these stuff. amazing
Holy 🎉
There was an automated piano player that used this exact system even down to the pedals in the 1800's
I'd like to see that charge a battery!
Player pianos did this over 100 years ago lmao
I think wind/solar power generation faces the same problem. The grid requires a constant even frequency but power generation are really uneven.
To są rozwiązania z przed lat. Fajna zabawka ale nie ty to wymyslileś. Zastosowałes.
BEAUTIFUL! I'm loving watching this evolve. What a life's work!
Crazy improvements ❤
So an escapement?
He has invented a kinetic motor. Place it in the water with waves pushing for energy 😅
Congrats you made a metronome
Walter Whites competition, the meth head came a long way from buying all the ingredients from one location to producing music.
No clue what it does but it's cool
Smoothing capacitor for humans!
Nostalgia
i remember this dudes videos were one of my firat experiences i had as a kid with youtube! im a fullgrown adult who is getting married next year and this mf is still going! respect❤
Bro you literally worked on this for 10+ years daaam
What? This guy is still alive??
GOJO?
And 10 years later, he will start adding glitches to the mechanism to get back, you know, that 'old feeling.' :D Congrats, tho - impressive!
U man
He's lookin' at me like the kid that painted the picture of Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers.
This is so sick ! 😊
Bro has created the human equivalent of a CVT.
You could’ve just used the design that already exists in a smaller platform, but this is, OK
And the operator looks like a cat making biscuits... truly a triumph 🎉
I still do not understand why this machine needs to have rocket-grade precision!
Ever heared of quantization
Now learn how burial produced
Mechanical diode bridge
The guy hasn't discovered midi quantisation yet. Can be done with a click of a mouse.
okay.  awesome.   well done.  i have a question though!!!!   why?   you thinking about getting some slaves or what?
Wait you still alive
flywheel and clutch. but there is another problem. how did you do it?
All I could think of was the intro to Time by Pink Floyd
Congratulations now you can play some of the easiest el stepario covers😅
You made the mechanical equivalent of a dc power supply. It take the oscillating signal, rectifies, filter and produces a steady dc output.
flooblebox technology or whatever its called from rick and morty XD
Autism²
This mad bastard is still at it?
i remember seeing that like 8-10 years ago.  Amazing that hes still working  Lets be honest: I would have taken the money from the first viral video and ran lol
The sound is familliar ehheheheheheheh
Isn’t that what a torque converter is for, I could be completely wrong so don’t roast me
I thought he was building those strange walking mechanical things at first
I love your machines!
set up a gear ratio that is kinda hard to turn, then reuse your old idea with the spin crank, but attatch rubberbands from the crank to the gears with a rod, so the bands twist on the rod. that way it builds pressure, but it wont exceed the speed that the gears set :)
Dude has a synchroscope made of cardboard, marker, and a drumstick just to play music more accurately
Mans figured out how to create Organic BeatMatch®️, no CDJ🤯
Now can you add a clutch and make a bike out of it 😅
What is the mechanism that he made and is using with his hands?  Interested in that style of kinetics 😁
The uneven human sound was what made it so great!
But what will you use it for..?
Amazing
Well finally
Boy if you keep this up you're going to build a wooden synthesizer pad.... How many years are you planning on doing this? It was cool at first but what's the end goal?
im pretty sure if this guy had enough time he could make a pedal wheel with flywheel powered mech suit
Dope.
Nice Gooble box. It is left with powering our homes and businesses, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano in my house. 😁
Man is just reinventing the computer
we all will be grandpas and grandmas before this guy finish the project.
incredible
bro made the metronome 2
I’m seriously so glad this guy is still here—
Yea robotic music isn’t good, that why people love human music or live music better. No thanks
These already existed though?
We have lost the plot….
Not quite my temp *throws chair at machine
....I can spin my shaft at a constant rpm. It's not hard, oh wait, yes it is!  ; )
Man i love all your stuff, keep it up buddy ✌️
This guy's eye can put everything in the universe 😂
I love the belt strapped flywheel haha
Bro made an analog quantizer lol
Give me a second eye
Human full bridge rectifier
Awesome. I can't wait to see what he makes with these advancements
a genius. But you should also try acting.
Have you finally abandoned this stupid Musk guy as your mentor? Are you back to craft and art? That would be great. I stopped watching you after your video where you wanted to do what musk said. I always hoped you get over it
so cool! interesting idea which had not crossed my mind
I was lost from you for 6 year and now I’m home
Really was a tragedy when you threw a lot of hard work away out of this obsession over tightness. Though, your solution is beautiful. Maybe now you can move on
For constant RPM you can use a clock escapement  mechanism.
The first one was amazing all those years back BECAUSE of the uneven difficulty feature 😢
Mi wristwatch does that too!
So this is what IT is doing in his free time.
A mechanical capacitor 😮
The French peasant physiognomy. I am happy it still exists. Good skills as well. Nic3.
why
Minecraft create has somehow made me under stand some of this hsit
But what he doesn't know is I'm stealing a small part of that energy to power my brake lights 😂😂😂
I think that this us already solved, look at constant speed airplane propellers.
As a Swedish person, I wish Swedish people knew how to pronounce "human".
Good job homie
The way that physics and music are so related blows my mind 💫💫
☝️    When you're a genius but have absolutely NO desire to help with the advancement of humanity in any way.
gooble box
Save to playlist > watch later
It's really inspiring to see you still working on this. I got worried during the development of the x version, but you seem to be making a lot of progress!
Dude. Imperfections are what robots wish they had. Its what we all go to concerts for.  Your trying to make digital media through analagoue means.  Its crazy
Wow! I remember seeing that first video of you playing this ungodly complicated machine and making incredible music with it. I haven't followed closely, but I did know you were going to make improvements. I can't wait to hear what you come up with next!
Very cool. This looks like it was inspired by the governor system in a player piano.
I loved the original video ❤❤❤
full bridge rectifier!
fun facts humans are not machines.
This is what happens when Germans loosen up
Not going to lie. I liked the variation in tempo on the original. Can’t wait to see how this comes out
The Sprockets are missing a band member.
You don’t like my $6 million idea I have four more. I don’t understand why you’re not messaging me believe me I’m not gonna be a member of YouTube.
Mad scientist I love it
This is really really stupid.  Again, feature creep.  If you want a constant output, just use an electric motor.
Like a giant clock right?
This looks like the Turbo encabulator
Зато игра на первой машине была действительно ИГРОЙ, буквально как на музыкальном инструменте... А тут просто механический автомат с точностью метронома🤷‍♂️
It's crazy you're still working on making new and improved... whatever musical gizmo that it is. I already know I'm going to be in awe to see the final product
my guy just made a mechanic capacitor
From the moment I understood the uneven rhythm of my flesh, it disgusted me.
A flywheel is essentially a mechanical battery and does this perfectly
I remember you because you use a 24 clock
meh, you took the human out of your human-machine merge. I liked the human influence.
Okay, I see what you're doing now!
Phil Rudd did this without machines. Dude was a human metronome.
oh so this is what cats are practising for
All I can see is “cat making biscuits” haha love it!
Rectifier… mechanically rectified rotational force, wild!
Watching the evolution of this machine over the years has been absolutely incredible
why are you house without facial hair
Reminds me one of those old self-playing pianos. iirc you actuate some foot pedal bellows and the machine always plays at a fixed speed.
Mechanical capacitor
As an electrical engineer, I can't help but see a power supply AC-DC converted into something mechanical. That is amazing.
Funny enough right after watching this Short I got a video explaining a player piano mechanism, which has a "suction-powered transmission which regulates the speed regardless of how fast you pump"  These have to fit inside an upright piano, so I wonder if they might shed some light on how to make it even more efficient!  Either way this is awesome, well done!
Estou a 8 anos esperando isso...
"Give me a second eye "
I'm surprised he still works on it.
Geppeto ahh
“My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard And they're like, it's better than yours”
Excellent, my friend.
Dude is the Dwemmer from Skyrim. Combining music and texhnology.
the problem was solved long ago with self playing pianos that had to be pumped by someone. no natter how fast you pump they play at the same speed
Bro literally solve vibrations in gear boxes 😭😭
Uhm... yeah, it's called spring drive, like motion picture cameras from the early 1900's through to the mid 1930's. Then hand held 8mm cameras through to the 1960's.  Yeah. Re-Inventing.
Bro, lezz goo !!
Self-playing pianos (pianolas) did something like this. A person would sit down and operate the piano by pressing on foot pedals, but the piano played music at a consistent tempo.
I have to say there is something to a machine making music sounding a little too mechanical, a little too good. There’s been many orchestras I’ve listen to who I heard mess ups and screw ups amongst the multitude of musicians going on,(except for Japanese orchestras, those mofos got it tight) anyway, the human factor of the music gives it a little bit of character sometimes that’s why one orchestra can play identical piece completely or partially different from a different orchestra they’re both enjoyable yet slightly different.
The sad thing is that for music you are tending in the wrong direction. It is the slight variations that gave the music character. Since the 2000's, a lot of music is produced via computer generation sampling. All beats are the same, perfect, but now lacking.
I swear, robots are trying to be more human and humans are trying to be more robots 😂
this reminds me of an episode of rick and morty, he created a miniverse where the people there use pedals like this to make energy for rick's car battery😂
In short, it's gotta work like a self-winding watch.   I takes chaotic energy inputs, winds it into some kind of spring, and that spring can deliver an even energy release.
The legend returns! It’s been so long brother, bless our ears with your experience outside the box!
juman
You developed the Gooble Box from rick and Morty
I was not expecting to see an update on the marble machine
Good for you marble man
what a madman, I remember that original video from forever ago
Delightful
Pardon my unintelligent question, but wouldn't that be a good bike pedal?
No no bc the wind up and wind down are the best part ❤🥵🥵🥵🥵
I'm familiar with the piece the clip comes from, and personally I love that off beat tempo, when it slows down and as he gets it back to speed, it makes the piece sound organic and human. A real breath of fresh air in a world of digitally produced and remastered tracks.  In fact there's an intro to a song that talks about, "the kids try to replicate their heroes, struggle, turn it up, and that's when the feedback starts" and what they're describing was the birth of a new genre... Imperfection makes for perfection
Man oh man, that was an entire life and 2 wives ago.
At first i though you where firing an AA gun
That mechanism used to be in really old elevators, i think they're called speed governors. Theres a little exhibit in the San Jacinto monument in texas about the construction of the obelisk, and they have the original governor from thr original elevator. They work by increasing torque to slow down the speed of a spinning shaft, and they do this by having weights on springed arms that will rotate outwards at high speeds. They're a very genius invention considering how old they are and how they work passively.
This is kinda how player pianos work
No quite my tempo😂
I used to watch that video on repeat when I was younger.
By this point I feel nothing was wrong with the original machine "if it ain't broke don't fix it"
Mech Engineers please explain, is that a fly-wheel?
I remember discovering your first machine in a physics class taught by a mechanical engineer back in highschool. I thought it was the coolest contraption ever built and blew my mind. Great to see you are still innovating to this day.
the manic laugh at the start is all i needed
Isn't that similar to the transmissions old foot pedal vacuum pump player pianos used to even out the playing speed regardless of how quickly the the user was pumping?
I cannot wait for the next marble music machine
That's actually some good things to consider when applying to development of a magnetic turbine. Small mechanical errors can buildup and off center rotation speeds causing fluctuations. Very good work here
Cool  I think i can also be done with an escape ment  or gass or fluid
You'll never get away with this!
Looks like a Gooble Box, or perhaps a Flooble Crank
OmG I can't believe it's been 8 years since I last saw your content.
Omg its been so long. Ur awsome my man.
I’m still confused as to what problem you even solved
What in the wind turbine gearbox is this shit😂
That is the kind of machine designed for a cat. Put a blanket over the pedals and a cat would be kneading that flywheel perfectly.
everyone else: human music machine me: haha. cat kneading go brr
Man i still have your original marble machine video saved on my old pc, im glad yo see you're still going at it
Bro causally made a geogauser for mechanics
Next use it for cs2
at first i thought you were just some guy trying to copy the success of the marble machine video, and then i realized that you were the man himself
Don't let ed miliband see this he will have us all using flooblecranks using this design
Great job, dude! The stuff you learn on Youtube.
When I forst saw/heard the marble machine, I thought "wow, OK, that's cool" and my inner engineer was impressed.   But, even as an amateur machinist, this is starting to drag a ittle
So you need a capacitor to clean up the power lol 😅
Patent it.
It is fun to think about the electrical analog to intagrate electical  components to transrom  a cyclic wave  function to be flat.
Ok so your insane i was 10 and i was shown the video by my music teacher and you’re still doing this
In the first few seconds you looked like a cat kneading, with the same serious face without looking at what you're doing and everything.
The Thingymabob
this is fucking beautiful, man
I’m proud of you dude! That’s some really great engineering there.
ot was impressive before and now it's above impressive
Look into player pianos, they have a baffle system that takes any speed of input and slows it down and only plays at a specific speed
use a bellow system from a player piano
Hehe Bro just invented human power!
Tbh I like that you control the tempo by your emotion
Those self playing pianos use air pressure and a valve to rotate the music cylinder at a constant speed when you press the pedals down.   Interesting to see a purely mechanical approach.
Man I remember when they were still building the first one.
Bro you could have just bought an little electric motor. You could have just used a fucking drill.
The Heston Blumenthal of musical engineering.
This was solved over a hundred years ago with the old self playing pianos that were controlled similarly.
they did this like 100 years ago lol
It's crazy i remember seeing the 1st machine in high-school it's great to see u made it perfect congrats brother
talented but over thinker
so  the next step is to just use a speaker and  computer
"let's listen to the machine play"   And then it sounds like a very humid Filming studio iyk what I mean..
Very Impressive, but since when has music become about perfection? If you wanted to be perfectly on time, the best way would be to use a motor and ditch the human.
This is very old tech, like that piano that play it self.
I followed you years ago on a whim just cus i thought that huge contraption looked super wicked. To see your innovation throughout the years is fantastic! Keep it up!
the last time I checked in with you was like 4 years ago lol. I am extremely happy to know that people work on projects for a long time
You didn't solve the problem, mechanical logicians did it 200 years ago.
So it's like a quantizer!
this video just helped me to figure out how i can make my custom treadle flat lap so thank you for the inspiration <3
FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER.
Uh-oh he did something again
Rick has entered the chat. This is just slavery with extra steps
It's neat, but the human element is what gives music soul. Taking out that little inconsistency in your machine might affect the sound in unexpected ways.
Thanks for producing this one of a kind peice dude
Damn i remember this .
Can make same with simple weight. Like in old clocks
the sound you hear at 1.00 am when u have young couples as neighbours
dr stone
I thought this was AtoZy
Oddly I just saw another short that had a player piano which featured something that also did this, running off of air pressure or vacuum. It would take the erratic pumping from the human and turn it into a constant, even beat to play the song in time on the piano. Kind of weird to see those 2 clips so close to one another.
Musician ❌ Engineer ✅
Jumen?
Sounds like my 🥎s  hitting ass
I don't think you understand what you've accomplished here. You are taking steady / random sinusoidal input and converting them to a constant rate of rotation.  I need to have this as a schematic.
Perfect BPM for "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard, and theyre like 'it's better than yours'"
Use a fluid transmission with disk plates like a water turbine it will ramp up speed and level out and changing fluid ratios and types can affect speed and pitch exc
Is that a transmission?
Bro ain't even playin the instrament anymore💀
Man.. been watching since the beginning and im so happy that you still are perfecting this.   Keep cooking brother! We are all rooting for you!
Flyball Governor - nice addition!!!
We've done it boys, we've solved music
I just knew a flywheel was going to be the solution. I'm merely a journeyman/amateur engineer, but I was so happy to come to the same solution
He’s just re-engineered the self playing piano from over 100 years ago to play multiple instruments and not be based on air pressure generated from billows. Pretty incredible that’s he’s managed to increase the complexity of the instrument to that extent and still find a way to make it work smoothly. Bravo.
For some videos, 1 like doesn't feel enough,  you know?
Well done, love to see people just DO!
Oh my god… all this time…. It’s really been that long?
You lost your way buddy, this is so much unnecessary engineering. Honestly breaks my heart to see you try so hard and fail multiple times because you dont know where to put your effort and energy. You need someone above you telling you how to work this project because right now you are spiraling and have been for a long time
Hahaha it's like an alternator on a car, very nice work you are 300 IQ bro!!!
Yeah, I've been seeing you work on this for some time. I used to think the jankyness of the first marble machine's tempo added character.   Great build. Excited to see what your future brings.
pov: mechanical ac to dc
Bro made the gooble box
Player pianos solved this years ago pretty neat machine nice work.
They already used machines to remove the human soul from music.  The result is called techno or EDM, which stands from Entropic Death Machine
Wow, nice job
I'm pretty sure just made a quantum computer, it's just only programmed to play your music at the moment
The human element is what makes it great
I listen to Marble Machine so often. It's just bloody well done.
I forgot about this guy, glad he’s still out here making this amazing stuff
You really tied your existence to this machine. It is very impressive, but after all these years I start worrying about you.
at awkward silent stare at the beginning 😮 😂
Or just get Neil peart to keep time
Yea this tech was already around with the automated or self playing piano. Uses vacum
Fellow Swede, very proud of you. My girlfriends always liked your music and I liked your jävlaranamma engineering 💪🥂🎉🍾
The human element was the beauty of your original machine. Why are you trying to engineer it out?
What my cats doing at 3am:
First video of yours I've ever seen and I'm so confused😂
For a second i thought you made propeller powered by pedal
I haven't seen this guy in years
I instinctively knew that such a machine would have to include something like that Watt's Regulator, which is one of the most genius devices of the last two centuries.
Shall we EDM producers tell him the flaw or shall we stay silent about this?
mmmmm metronome, mmhmm
Ever heard of a flywheel?
The mad scientist cackle at last!
yhea i cant, your eyes really bother me, please seek some help
"reincarnated, I'm stargazer, life goes on I need all my babies" 😂
This guy is playing real life factorio
I can imagine this stuffs can take advantage of exercise machines to generate electricity...
Why did I think the machine at the start was going to play Stacy’s Mom hahah
How did the old automatic piano players that used bellows and air keep time?
mechanical capacitor
this is a really cool doohickey man
Bro's an music engineer
Heeeees Baaaaaack
in 2040, the Marble Machine XVII will have no human input whatsoever (and thus no room for error) and will book its own flights and tour autonomously playing music around the globe
very nice design...good job man , bautiful
Wow
I have been waiting 8 years to hear this man laugh triumphantly. Thank you for not giving up on your dream.
Gooble box right there
Swing is important too.
Love your music 🤙
congratulations, this is a great achievement
Analogue quantizing
Gooble Box 🫵
I feel like we're way past that but I want to reiterate that what made the first one *great* wasn't exactly... mechanical perfection. Still, excited for when this one is done.
That is quality content seeing this guy finaly improved hes creation
Nah you just don't practice with a metronome like a real musician.
Congrats!  You solved something player pianos solved ages ago!
Isnt this a filter circuit
Fuckin love this project, ive been watching it since year 1
Literally old tech, took him 8 years to watch a video on differential
I cant wait to see this on the Marble Machine III!
A cat can operate this machine.
I think the variation may have been part of the charm of the original
This dude turned mechanical AC to mechanical DC
Can someone explain me in french please
Very cool 🎉
This was invented ages ago... it is used in almost all pneumatic automatic pianos.
Now get those gears cut from brass/steel so they dont wear out in ten hours.
This guy is a great artist and an amazing engineer too.
Does taking so much of the human element out take away from the art? Where is that line?
He did it Omg he did it!!!
Holy smokes he's still working on the marble machine
So in essence turn ac into dc 😂
Player pianos did this with vacuum power
I don't want to take anything away from your accomplishment but maybe sometimes that the human input is what makes it cool
This is cool and all, but didn't this technology basically exist already in old player pianos?
the governor (shown 3rd in this assembly) was first used for this same purpose (even speed) on the first steam engines several hundred years ago.
So… you re-engineered the device that fits into a piano to make it play by itself? I forget what it’s called  Idk how to explain how the machine works, but I do know the machine has a mechanism that takes human input and evens it out to play a consistent tune, exactly like the mechanism you just made for your instruments. No matter how fast or hard you pump the billows on that piano, the song will always come out at the same pace  What you did is amazing full-stop, most people couldn’t do that kind of engineering work at all. But I’m absolutely positive that what you just made already exists
The next form of marble machine. Making biscuits
When the machine is finally done, it better be in the Book of World Records for the most intricate music machine built by one person.
The player piano has this function
The line between art and engineering is further blurred...
I’m a drummer that trains internal time daily. I’m exactly like that machine. One consistent tempo. Never wavering. Solid as a rock. I’m available for hire btw
FULL BRIDGE…..human-ifier?
Cool! Self-playing paino's have a mechanism to ensure the music is played in time regardless of how fast the "player" pumps the pedals.
My cat making biscuits
This is kind of like a bagpipe; you fill the bladder with air however fast you can but squeeze at an even rate with your arm to push the air into the pipes
The old player piano machines had a very similar system so that no matter how fast you pushed the bellows it played at the same speed.
Hi
Gg
This guy a genius
How well does it work underload
Its so interesting seeing someone solve a problem thats been solved by humanity years before but through only their individual means, its like rediscovery but for the individual lol
Yeah, a black guy could have never created this. Stop preaching equality, it will be the death of us Whites.
Could have looked into those old auto pianos that had the peddles to press with you feet. They did what you are doing
"oh my god hes still doing it" i had completely forgotten about you but this is amazing
DUDE OMG YOURE THAT GUY FORM SO MANY YEARS AGO
DID THIS MF JUST UPGRADE THE MARBLE MACHINE????
It's so awesome to see you're still on this machine!
Five years later still no marble machine. 😢
The way the governor spreads out and contracts is similar to how steam tractors keep a steady pace
This man needs to be protected at all costs, he's doing a lot for experimental music.
Passion can't be stopped :D
The player piano solved this problem more than 100 years ago
You need an escapement!
a motor will do
Rick Sanchez would like to know your location.
That laugh is both satisfying and unsettling
I have a bonkers idea, if this marble machine is finished you could program the song of the first marble machine on this one and then compare side by side
At least you’re not building weapons of mass destruction. Rock on bro!
as you know, some cases perfect tempo is great, but sometimes it's nice to have variances for "feel"
When Hurdy Gurdy meets Rube Goldberg.
There is lots of research on this topic, search for "microtiming deviations in music"
Fascinating. The demonic laugh, the inhuman obsession, the desire to exclude our fallibility, everything a cartoon demon needs, yet in a musician. What is REALLY happening here?
Music without human flaws is like a sanitized version of nature. It might look and sound real... but it never really feels real. If you want to give ppl chills, do not aim for perfection. -Jimi Hendrix should be all the proof you need.
Oh man, it’s been years. I remember watching that marble music machine thing on repeat and then following for a bit after. But I fell off somewhere. Glad to see you back on my feed
Yes! Fantasic work. Your stuff is so satisfying to watch.
You've tasted "victory" so often in the last decade that youre no longer capable of recognizing the taste of anything else.  Do you even know where you're going with this anymore?  You've basically wandered in through the back door of AI music.  That has no human imperfections in it, either.
That's a machine purpose built to extract energy from a happy cat's biscuits.
Im convinced we should use athletes and musicians to create electricity 😂😂
Victorian era Victory!
This is crazy impressive
I will literally never understand what the point of this creation is. I mean, sure, the guy is definitely enjoying the process. But before it feelt like sn instrument. And every improvement just takes some of the human soul out. Without imperfections you sre just making a mechanical, stupidly expensive midi player arent you?
Boi outbhere doing everything possible to not use a computer. Ai who?
Ok I’m just going to give you this do you understand you paired with the grab light guys can make clean energy for homes you lift the weight with exercising and then use it as a battery
rick sanches microverse battery had this
I used to keep tabs on Marble Machine X, and then after about 3 or 4 years I gave up. Somewhere along the way it seems perfection became the focus, rather than the instrument itself.  This is for sure a clever system, and it works. It must have taken a great deal of time and energy to develop and produce. But why? Is the inconsistency in a human's tempo really that bad for the music? All of the best music ever made - in-fact until fairly recently, all music ever made, was filled with imperfections and flaws - the human touch.  I hope the focus becomes music again, and not mechanical perfection, but I've given up waiting.
Dude installed a governor. How cool is that?!
Mechanical bridge rectifier
congratulations.
I was like wtf is this.  Then they showed the machine and i was like damn dudes still at it.
So, mechanical quantization. Funny cause you had a machine that sounded somewhat human and now you just took the human element out and now it’s lifeless and robotic again. lol.
I didn't see the name, I thought this before the vid cut to the instrument. But my literal first thought was, "Perfect gears? This would be perfect for the marble machine!"
My man your dedication is admirable. I've been watching you tweak that marble machine for atleast over a decade
wtf I watched?😅
This man and his videos give huge autistic vibe
Can't wait to see your new machine, but the first machine is still awesome
I have an old hand-wound record player from the 1900's (decade). I've taken it apart, and it has a similar mechanism inside to regulate the tempo at which the record spins. It's really cool!
Look into watchmaking. Those mechanisms are what you’re looking for
Awesome to see you again!
Bro that video is ancient bro is STILL perfecting the craft let's go
I wasn't paying attention at first so when you insinuated alternating motion to direct emotion I thought of a diode and then I realize it was a mechanical thing but I think it made it easier for me to understand what was going on once I saw all the moving parts
LETS GO NEW MARBLE MACHINE UPDATE
i always thought this wintergatan machine was kinda incredible but sounded mid af
What about the mechanism in the player piano, that evens out the input speed so that no matter how fast someone is pumping the machine it plays at the correct speed?
Love that you haven't given up on this! I watched with awe the original machine and admired you genius at the whole thing, i know there has been other versions since but i still watch that original machine with awe and all you have done since!
Es la manivela flubel... Será como esclavitud con pasos extra o trabajarán y se pagarán entre ellos 🤔😂, Excelente trabajo 👍🏻
You have become a giant mechanical watch maker 😅
Gooble box, and a fluble crank COMBINED!
I still remember seeing the marble machine when it came out and it was actually like THE viral video at the time
Isn't all the mechanics you need basically the same as a weight clock(coo coo clock)?
This guy is a genius.
Loved the first marbke machine.. but 10 years later i think its getting a little too much engineer and too little music
i was just watching something about an old player piano that did this on its own I wonder how they did it?
For some reason…I’m seeing a cat when it does its front paw stretch by clawing the carpet or your skin, at the end of the video
The first marble machine song is constantly in my head lol That bassline was awesome!
You built a mechanical capacitor.
You look like a tipikal genius crazy scientist 😮😅
What is the spinny balls thing (the governor) doing for the setup? I understand all the others - flywheels serve as inertia that smooths speed/torque variations, the weight serves as speed independent energy storage (Whereas a flywheel does change speed with input variation, just slower), but the governor...?!
This is what YouTube should be. Mad genius!
So AC to DC?
sebulbas podracer
this guy is musician...with some extra steps
This is what it was for many scientists: madly in love with science
none of you know how exited i was when i realized who this dude was after feeling like something was familiar
Well now a cat can play your instrument
How about the human operates a water pump into an upstream reservoir which feeds a downstream turbine. As long as the turbine has a minimum head, it will always spin at a standard rate. The reservoir will absorb excesses of head and compensate for shortages.
Now I know I subscribe to this channel years ago. I don't appreciate YouTube unsubscribing me from you.
a generator, a electric motor and a capacitor should do the trick very.
A mechanical rectifier 😮
They solved this problem 100 years ago with player pianos.
Bro is taking so long because he can't think of a song as catchy as the first one
Couldn’t you also feed the torque input into a spring with a fine ratcheting mechanism, then output through a gear reduction to get a fixed speed?
I absolutely love the work you are putting into optimizing your machine, I still absolutely love listening to it, and I CANNOT wait to listen to your final product
Its the new Rick And Morthy Car battery generator
Industrialisation
So you made a player piano with extra steps very cool
Its good to see you again!!!
well congradulations now you make music sound less human XD
We are witnessing a man pour his whole soul into the creation of a machine.
Wintergatan has finally done it! He's finally gone mad lmao ☠☠
Man that is smooth
The governor was derived from James Watt's designs.
Use a capacitor. Done. Easy peasy.
Me at the beginning of the video “😮 i guess it works? Hes happy…”  Me at the end “oh he’s a genius and it works perfectly” 😂
wow he just copied a player piano mechanics
I thought he corrected wintergaten's mechanism. ... . . He is fkn wintergaten😂😂
Bro made a mechanical transformer
ok but could you do this on a smaller scale? say, small enough to fit in your hand and be powered by one finger?  you could make a music box that is never out of time
Nice engineering man
THE MARBLE GUY IS BACK
Jesus, has it been 10 years now? You still on it? A for consistency
Someone please tell him to not wear loose clothing with that thing and those gears around. 😢😮
Governors are usually connected to something that provides negative feedback, responding to a change in RPM - the pitch of a propeller blade, the spark ignition mechanism in a gasoline engine, a throttle valve. Quite curious about what it's doing here.. some sort of brake, perhaps?
I saw the black thing looking like it was stroking the wood and I thought this was a totally different machine
This is mechanical art ... Marvelous
🫠
You are from the future
Please make music again with the other members..
That laugh was... mildly sinister. Should we worry about this guy becoming the next Heinz Doofenschmirtz? He's already in the habit of making -inators after all...
FULL BHUMAN RECTIFIIAAAAA
Genuine live among of us ❤
I heard the beat rythm, heard a semi-german sounding laugh....immediately thought he made some sort of AA turret...specially something from 1941.
Now train your cat to use it.  Instead of making biscuits, they'll make sweet music.
perfect tempo sounds like ass, its never sounded good
Not hyperbolic at all 😂😂
Cats while making biscuits 🐈 🐈‍⬛ 🎉
What is the power output compared to input energy? compared to lose to even out the power output?
Any electrician could’ve told you you needed a rectifier…
Nerd
Now lets build this up with all beautiful manually machined brass parts
man's a true master
0:00 So it's playable by cats?
I think the constant tempo takes a little bit of soul out of the music.
That feeling when the problem you've been working on is finally solved! One of the best parts of engineering.
It's been a few years since I last saw the progress, I'm so happy to see the project is still in full swing!
I have no idea of what's going on but I love it... 😅😂 Weird
What if you just changed your gear ratio to actually be 1/8th notes as you pedal
Jokes on you, the software can quantize itself lmao
Mechanical capacitor
Well looks like another artist that influenced my childhood lost track of what made their thing cool in the first place
Hyped for the Wintergatan DX ultra
Congratulations, you've achived an equivalent of converting AC to DC!
Designing and re designing and redesigning and making and redesigning and remaking and redesigning.  I was once making a 3d printer and it was taking so long because I kept trying ti improve my original design. I realized that I really wanted to print and not build so I abandoned it. But I do like to watch the analytical process of improvement but I'd also like to see it make music.
Bro's building a gooble box to power his car
What a truly great person you are man.
now give this to a microuniverse civilization and harness fraction of energy produced from each being to power your brake lights
We have charming Europeans with the kind of autism that's like this but for green technology right?  Cause if not we're fuct, but also have this machine:
Yes
So a reverse CVT
What is the built in bass for ?
I've been keeping up with this channel for a very long time. 4+ years at least! I love the music man gj with the latest break through!
what's a juman/euman?
Lol, the forever machine
I mean most people just use a . metronome but ok
Just put a variable speed electric motor on it already
Dude! These shorts are pretty dope.
You are a mad scientist
Rick sanchez vibes
Dude's going to take all humanity from the music. It'll be worse for it. So many "problems", that did not need solving.
As a Dutch, i like this tempo
I mean cool invention but little mistakes and adjustments are what make music have flavor and sound human and not mechanical.  It's why autotune sounds like warmed up poop because nature doesn't sound mechanical.
Why not jusint just a motor?
So a human powered motor?
We already invented this long ago. A spring for mechanical energy. Human can wind it as it's playing in a music box, yet it maintains the same tempo until it runs out of energy. Just that but bigger.   Though I'm not quite in my mechanics year yet, and if this is better, I'd love to learn how.
There’s no way. He’s still at it. Trying to eliminate imperfection. As if working around imperfections isn’t what makes art great. Bro is unwilling to express himself through a flawed medium 😂 bro forgot the universe itself is flawed 🤣
For all females wanting to know thems there is the crazy eyes
I think this was a problem developed due individual skill level at a certain task as opposed to a general deficiency that applies across the entire population.
Sounds weird when it’s exact
Make it play jazz
Ohh my god i haven't seen this guy in years....real life animusic
yeah and youre gonna scrap the marble machine again. i recon if you got a mechanical engineering degree, you wouldve finished it by now
Этот парень - гениальный механик и инженер!
Didn't the player piano figure this out, but simpler? Still cool though. Very cool. Wish I could build something like that.
Um... Yeah. You basically rediscovered what engineers figured out a few hundred years ago, requiring the introduction of the flying weight governor and fly wheel weights. You still see it most commonly in small gas engines.   That all said, it is good to see you putting it to use outside of it's normal application AND explaining the impact.
But isn't the slight inconsistencies what gives it character?
"Do your pets prefer electric light? Do they lay awake at night, contemplating Thomas Edison."
A Human Rectifier.
I swear I thought I blocked this channel.
blud created a mechanical capacitor
Bro make a fullwave rectifier but for physical movement 😅
Unless your an engineer this guy really makes you feel dumb 😂
Pushing the pedals with that look in his eyes  ....i thought he was mimicking a cat. The sudden laugh confirmed it 😂
SO GLAD THE DRAGON THAT IS MARBLE MACHINE (S) HASNT CONCORDED OUR MARTIN. I REMEMBER KEEPING UP WITH THE MMX RELIGIOUSLY UNTIL I UNFORTUNATELY FELL OUT OF IN the cdc and cad era ( around the time perfectionist martin lost the plot) BUT WOULD REGULARLY REVISIT.  it was so satisfying to watch a group of dedicated engineers make the marble machine play the marble machine song the OG played. But im excited for the stage to come to life next   Lets go WINTERGATEN   SENDING LOVE FROM ILLINOIS US
We got the googble box before gta6.
Isn't that how a player piano works? I see nothing new here👀
Human AC/DC!
This reminds me of those pump pianos with the paper roller
Create mod
When peoole make things they dont know what and why, but looking back, to go forward.
Jonathan Moffett is falling of his chair laughing.
This is why I buy German cars
Cool.. mechanism version of what a capacitor does in a circuit
Why not use bellows it what’s they use for the piano playing machines, much easier than this
You don't have to call yourself the human xD we can see that.
Why?
Congratulations, they just invented a geared cvt. Should be incredibly smooth and tunable to any tempo between 0 and infinite. Though, energy input varies and given the wooden nature I think heat build up, especially with something as flexible as wood will need to be kept at a minimum to maintain pitch and punch.
Yeah well, you need power of L - the induction element
Now all you need in a mini universe with sufficient sentient life to power your spaceship car.
Since the shaft spins at a constant RPM, how do you intend to adjust the tempo? Will you have something to adjust the output speed based on your needs?
I'd be curious to see if the mechanism could be hooked up to a dc motor to measure its power output...
The problem with music these days is that quantizing has made music sound mechanical.  A machine sounding like a machine that is manually cranked to sound like a computer that has quantized analog input into mechanical sounds.  Music becomes very limited when it becomes mechanical.  Blast beats do not sound good when produced as mechanical.  Now creating a machine to articulate specific styles that are not mechanical (such as blast beats) that replicate a human feel, well then you've got the full spectrum of control.
Not to underplay your clever work around, but have did you consider using air pressure regulated by water? Hydraulic organs were invented centuries ago for the very same purpose of regulating inconsistent human input into a constant
Ah yes. The Gooble Boxes technology.
If you remove all of the human factors from your music, are you really making music anymore?  Also, how many lifetimes are you going to spend, designing and re-designing and over-engineering the joy and wonder out of what you did perfectly, the first time?!  😢
Heja Sverige ❤❤❤
Does hyperbolic in this sense mean one to take shortcuts?
Watched a video last night about the same ossue for automatic piano player working on a foot pump, with air regulation and thr mechanism it uses to maintain constant pace regardless of pump speed. This was actually solved sooooo long ago this device is over 100 years old
Manual foot pump with bellows for regulation
fantastic work
Sad to see Martin got so lost down the rabbit hole and still confuses relentless conviction his new idea will be perfect with just a new way to fail. A flywheel is fine, but he had that from the start. A governor ? Kiss expression goodbye. And his relentless obsession with tightness is something else anyway, thats the relative sync of the different channels & keeping that invariant with tempo requires the channels all have the same *latency*.   Theboriginal machine had such soul, 8 years work he is further away than ever,So sad
yah...clock exists
My comments are AI
That reminds me of those old self-playing pianos that have a similar mechanism that regulates the speed of the piano no matter how fast you pump it.
BRO WAS MY CHULDHOOD
in the words of probably someone "the human goal is to automate everything so 'I' dont have to do anything."
i like how he used the same mechanism that pneumatic player pianos use
3d printing changed your whole world
I wonder who funds this guy because he looks like the poster child for USAID
He’s back! 🎉
I would sit and do that with my feet the entire time I play games. I would be a power generator.
🛐
It took you 8 years to figure this out?! 😂 I figured it out in a few minutes by just watching this video.
Hooville ahh music
So we're reinventing the vacuum operated self playing piano?
Cut the video after the first laugh and give no explanation-  and it’s total chaotic madman energy.
Its been a while since the last time i viewed this machine
good lord he's still workin on that old thing? dude that's sick, keep it goin man. love this shit.
Why?
The original video still remains some of my favorite content to ever exist on YouTube. Fantastisch <3
This idea is so intriguing and provoking. It’s like if DaVinci was trying to make a VST or DAW. For me - the whole project really redefines what composing and automation is. Not so much in the concept of either, just what typically pops into mind when they are brought  up in discussions.
this is so cool! I love that you're still working on this with such intensity and dedication and yielding such satisfying results.
old pianos that played from punch cards powered by wind  bellows used something like this to keep tempo from human input
As electro boom would say”FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER”
A flooble crank
I believe there is a piano thing that does this.
Wait... you are still making it?😮
Glad to see you're still posting 😃
Obviously it's not about the music or the machine anymore, there will never be a "world tour" you're a YouTuber now and your content is just you endlessly tinkering. Which is fine, but that's the reality. You'll always find a way to overcomplicate things because if you actually complete the machine your channel would cease to exist.
So basically is a spintronic/mecankc rectifier + filter
Created a mechanical clock that plays drums instead of telling time. Awesome!
Feel that why no machine drummer unlike piano
Bro made a gooble box
they already have that.... its called a wind up watch.
I mean ragtime pianos had this ability, didn't matter how fast or hard you pumped, they would always play at the same rate
old sewing machine on steroids
Bro invented the Gooble Box….
Intro scene: You appear more than a teeny-bit insane. The laugh doesn’t particularly help…
I thougt those self playing pianos that operated by similar pedals already solved this problem ages ago
This is outstanding Sir! Creating a machine that can take inconsistent input and put out constant motion is fkn crazy! You basically made a mechanical capacitor, my friend! bravo! got yourself another follower.
Dude created a thingamagigger
Finally
Didn't old school clocks that operated on falling weights have something that did this? Forgot the name of the particular... gear.
I would say my mechanical watch does the same thing. Just in a very different way
Wouldn't it kind of lose the magic of it were perfect
I remember when the 1st marble machine song video was made, it was revolutionary now i wait years for you to make the second marble machine to do songs on, and i wait for so long I've lost intrest and now i see now you have started something different, finished the 2nd marble machine and no new songs were created as far as i could tell from what i have found.  I regret watching all the videos of you building the 2nd marble machine.
this sounds like old rice mills we used to have
I was devastated to hear what happened to the first machine! Cant wait for the latest!
@venjent VENJENT
Holy shit, he's still out here doing this. This man made my 12 year old mind wonder and enjoy the music his machine made.   Thanks for the memories. Can't wait to see what else you come up with
Not much for being ‘hyperbolic’  Lol nice
Doesn’t an auto playing piano already have a mechanism for this?
Fun fact: those governors are where the term "balls out" comes from
Damn,  i need you catch up on what is going on with this project.
Where is the music... Loved the first one.. it is my ringtone. Waiting for the next one.
It would be perfect if theres a cat pushing down the pedals
Man, this guy is still milking this?
Rube Goldberg would be proud!😂😂
Good to see you still working on these amazing machines. I remember back in the day your marble machine was one of the first YT videos i saw
They have a device inside self playing pianos that takes the uneven peddling of the operator and converts it into constant air pressure for the instrument
OK, that started off weird, but I'll admit that is definitely worth giggling over.
Make it also have a gravity based energy storage that lifts a heavy sand bag with excess energy input so that you can take a break as it falls powering the machine and keeping in stnc
make analog techno with it
So the future of captchas???
I just saw an old timey piano that auto played using a vacuum, it seemed it solved this problem, but maybe with air it's easier?
Isnt that set-up kinda like what the automatic pianos used to smooth out the use of the foot pedals? I saw the gay baking dude putting his piano together and he mentioned a piece that did this. It looked like a smaller version
your making biscuits
So a vaccum pump player piano. They figured that out in the 1800s.
Oh god this is still going? Haven’t seen a marble video in years. I had assumed he was done with the machine but it looks like he is still milking the views.
Heck ya still at it!!
This seems like a lot of over engineering when you could have just studied the inner mechanism of a player piano. Seems kind of the obvious choice considering....this is pretty much exactly what you are building, just with various instruments.
I'd just like to say that this is scary similar to how a phonograph works, did you take any inspiration?  Because that's awesome!!
My man is inventing the floogle box from that one episode of rick and morty
This asshole and Nilered could together make a fusion reactor.
I'm 10 seconds in to the video, gonna call it now, he rediscovers the flywheel from over 300 years ago.
I don't remember how they do it but there was a way that they used vacuum on Old player pianos where you use your feet to actually build a vacuum for the machine and then it had a self Governor inside of it to do much the same thing
Didnt player pianos already solve this?
Congrats you solved in 8 years the same problem solved by the 19th century later piano!
Yes yes yes!!! 🚀
Oh wow, this is new! Glad to see this project come back!
But didn't they solve this problem in the 1800s for self-playing pianos?
I always thought a single flywheel is enough
nice
This dude must’ve  really liked the Dr.Seuss instruments
People already hate when everything is snapped to a grid, this is the worst thing ever.
Human imperfections sound better
Few things are as satisfying as having a problem and solving it yourself. Sure learning from other will teach you faster and likely be a better result, but the amount of accomplishment you get solving your own with your less then perfect, but perfectly good enough solution just hits the spot.
Amazing
Dude is still one upping himself, insane
Excellent work, sir!
the kitten that has been taken away too soon from it's mother be like:
That problem was solved centuries ago for player pianos. No matter how fast or slow you pumped (slow to a degree) the mechanism maintained the proper speed and vacuum for the piano to operate. Re-solving a problem that was figured out well over a hundred years ago is kinda mid
quite an impressive way to build a fk machine
Like one of those piano machines that plays through vacuum
It's very impressive but isn't that why live music sounds so much better than a recording? The inconsistency, the feel of the moment, the band reacting to each other or even how the individual might feel a note should've been sang or played? Still though brilliant work! I loved your work for years now and it's still so impressive to me. Thank you🙏🏾
I'm looking for videos where I can hear it playing, but all I get is you talking😐
What about a machine that amplifies imprecise power inputs so it can show that even electric motors aren't perfect?
Man it's been a while since I've seen your video, i always loved it
This whole setup reminds me of the old phonograph motors found in crank phonographs
This reminds me of a reel i saw recently of an antique self playing piano, powered by a very similar petal mechanism.
congrats!
The Man just made a musical gooblebox
It will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine. *MUHAHAHAHAHA*
This is the one guy who actually did something with a music engineering degree
I love the ingenuity, but I do wonder if removing the variability of human input could remove some magic... though it could make it much better! I hope to see an update soon
i feel like the first one had personality and fit with the music
they do the same thing for old pianos that play themselves
How many more years will this project take.
nice job! Gratulation! 🎉 I was hoping to hear the song "improved" too. You can't have everything... All the best to you anyway! Hang in there! 👍🤞
steve buscemi mad smart
So basically you made a mechanical PID Controller. Good job.
I have been on this journey so long
Why do I get steam engine vibes?
Major upgrade. Very cool!
dude, you were my childhood, so happy to see that you're still on this awesome idea year's later
This mechansim is used in pneumatic organs
You're really smart! Keep it up homie, this blunt goes out to you! <3
How many years have I been watching this? Still love it
Human tempo is better, its about the nature of the sound that makes it special
Automatic pianos back in the day used very similar mechanicals to make sure it played on tempo. They worked with suction and actuators that you "fueled" by stepping on some bellows. That's basically exactly what you are doing with your hands and that rotating wheels is where you'd put the melody sheet.
I would guess a mechanical watch like you give it power but it consistent
117's all across the line!
You figured out a 200 year old if not molder tech it’s analog dude
I remember you from my childhood, one of my brothers showed me your music machine vid!
organs and older non electric player pianos also had the same problem as the machines needed to be pumped by feet and the air flow had to be constant.
World's largest metronome
Same concept that they used on the old player pianos.
put a comfy cat on that bad boy.
Ah I remember this video
Google Springdrive
tight!... very tight!
It’s the same video just 5 years later. Let me make a device that plays tight music, ponder on it for a couple of months then abandon it to make another tight machine. This is not a marble machine channel, this is a mental masturbation channel.
I personally enjoy the slight variation of human performance Gives the music that personal flair
Mad scientist vibes
First few seconds is my cat on my belly when I'm trying to sleep
Hell yeah man
so he made a mechanical capacitor ??
He made a computer but it’s not a computer lol
"I can just taste victory right here"  Him in the video: *lick*
Player pianos solved this problem a LONG time ago. You should get a hold of an old player piano insert and take apart the governor on that to get a full breakdown on how to do that.
I swear the algorithm knows what I'm learning. -Yesterday I see a short about antique auto-pianos, they have a pressure system that creates a regulated tempo from irregular pumping. -Then this video shows up of someone making the gismo I was curious about. I suppose if you're looking for inspiration that might be a neat place to look, sound like people figured this out a long time ago!
Nice. With enough gears u dont need capacitors
Henry Ford wins again
Sweet. I was wondering if i was the only one who thought the marble machine song was off time or maybe i was insane. Regardless it was amazing creation, amazing idea. And amazing song.
Hyped
Now all you need is a camshaft for the pedals you are pressing. All you have to do is crank the camshaft
Not bad.
Now lets apply the same priciple to lightweight car shells and flinstone our way to clean air 😂
Yes
Bro.  Your dedication, invention, and genius to this machine is DaVinci levels.  Amazing.
didnt expect him to still be doing this
Didn't even know that there was something like this in the world
1.9tdi
The next Jacob&Co 😆
You built a clock
I want you tube to actually implement the “do not recommend channel” button so that I don’t have to keep seeing this annoying piece of shit on my feed
This looks like it could be used to create energy
Am i the only non innocent one?
Like a less compact player piano.
You know... servos and steppers exist ja?
Congrats!
Just saw a video on a very old piano that plays by itself using suction. It uses feet to power it and does the same as this cool!
But can it play Doom?
This is what I think those hardcore redstoners would be like if they applied themselves to something physical
Leonardo da Vinci of music 👍💪🫡
Well done you have made a gooblebox
Lol the joy of a complicated machine to simply produce evenly spaced sounds... It really is the small things in life 😂
❤
You are the big G
nice
He gets old and the machine still doesn't produce music.
I wonder your mechanical energy losses are compared to AC to DC conversion? Hmmmmm interesting machine  🧐
The rick and morty battery
Brooooo i found this again how awesome
My god, you've made the Gooble Box from Rick and Morty
Congratulations bro made a complicated timing belt lol
This was solved with the player piano. No matter how fast you pump your feet the player stays consistent
this makes me so happy that you're still tinkering away at this passion <3
Every time you come up, I'm more and more amazed by you! My God! The synthesis of art and engineering is exceptional! 👏👏👏👏👏
This is what madness looks like ladies and gentlemen
Bro made a flooglecrank
i think that drift is part of what makes music human.
mechanical pianos did this 100 years ago.
the Days of the Grinder are over :D
I mean, that laugh at the start sums it up. It feels JUST right.
Uman
I just watched a video about a player piano that did this with actuated switches like 100 years ago.
Bro made a mechanical bridge rectifier
I just hope he can still slow down and speed up tempo to keep some "human element"
You're about 20 steps away from a car.
Que maravilla!
Self playing pianos have done this where you use your feet and they control the rpm
Great! Now create a mechanical way to slightly randomize the beat to humanize it!
I adore the fact that there are people out there that can feel so powerfully about nothing and build unimaginably beautiful things because they didn't matter at all.
Just get one happy cat to make biscuits on the pedal, then you are good to go!
I enjoyed it more when it was art over it being a purely engineering thing. At this point just use an electric motor.
The most sophisticated bicycle.😂😂😂😂😂😂  Can you turn it into a car
That’s not quite my tempo
This technology already existed in automated pianos.
Its funny, music players as far back as the Edison cylinder drives use a flyball centrifugal governor like that one to keep perfect time regardless of variances of input energy!
Wild west pianos that played with air had a transmission similar to this
Wintergatan, there is truly a mad scientist lost in you.
It's going to end up building a whole mechanical computer
It's a mechanical capacitor, huh
All you gotta do is look at the old automatic pianos, they have a similar system.
You look like a cat padding
i am sry... but if you go on and on within this universe you just rebuild a computer....
I quite liked the unevenness of the old one ngl
Mechanical representation of AC to DC power
I've not recovered from the marble machine X fiasco.
That Maniacal laugh, Thanks God he's on to music, and not World Domination or stuff.
full bridge rectifier: music edition
Now make them foot pedals!
Wow
holy shit he's still at it. haven't listened to wintergatan in a decade
You look like a cat massaging something with those pedals
Is this the same technology used in old-timey piano rolls?
Ich habe deine ersten Videos gesehen vor langer Zeit....Endlichkeit ist relativ...du bleibst dran..Gruß Stefan
Great job
Im real curious how the governer regulates it
How do you make money to where you can just work on this for 8 years?
Just wondering..could this be aplied to some sort of tiles on a sidewalk and produce steady stream of electricity? For street lights or something🤷‍♂️
You did not solve a problem. That has not been a problem since the Player Piano.
The Doohicky
I mean we'll done.  That's a fantastic bit of kit. Your obviously my kind of genius. What are you going to do with it though? Or just do that? Because can.
there is something to be said for the human quality though
One of the greatest, if not the greatest, geniuses on YouTube.
Dude I can’t believe how much mechanical engineering this project requires
Amazing❤
dman a mechanical capacitor
I was here since Marble machine but sadly lost my internet access around when you move to France and started to building frames of new machines. And now I come back and see you still active, that makes me happy so much.
Well done!
...have a look at player-pianos and their governor system: no matter how fast you pump them, they run to tempo. Same problem, mechanical solution.
this dude is the enbodiment of the optimized ocd
Love the music, love the process!
His music and machine are great
Don’t player pianos have a mechanism that does this so the paper spool doesn’t go too fast or too slow?
Him looking into camera in begin pumping the machine looks like cats making biscuits
I like that the tempo wasn’t tight. I really think when u finish the world tour you should remake the first design. There was a charm in the way the beat isn’t perfect. Like real music played by a real person. It’s not hard to stay on beat with something a bit off beat. Tho im sure on a big stage its super hard to stay on beat with someone across the stage because of physics and its echoy and big and sounds arrive at weird times because of it.  Idk. Keep doing you. U always make good decisions in the end.
i remember a really old automatic organ, that had something similar although i remember it begin much simple, although it was powered by air. two enormous bellows below the floor (this was in a church before it was renovated to have electric motors to provide the air)
Dude more shorts
Probably a chineese company have copied your solution and is already selling a product based on it. LOL
Man I remember when the first marble machine video came out and I was obseeeessed, so cool to see the progress on this new machine. Can't wait to see the finished product!! I just know the music will be bangin
I feel like you could use this for exercise, and energy...
Isn't part of what gives music it's soul the slight imperfections of the human involvement?  Don't get me wrong, I love this and I think it's an incredible marvel of engineering.  I'm here for this project 100%, but I fear the pursuit of perfection might lose some of the magic.
I would argue the slightly imperfect input of humans is what give music its beautiful nature the slight flaws are a signature of even the most skilled artists some would even call them flare or the soul of a musical composition. I’d love to hear your thoughts
So the fella spent 8 years on an overengineered metronome???
Bro made autotune for drummers 💀
Isn't this what an escapement in a watch is for? No matter how slow or fast the system goes, the pallet keeps it ticking at the right rate
we're 2 or 3 prototypes from steam guys xD
Me and my family i love this guys music 😂🎉
Love this guy's innovation, but he hardly ever actually plays his marble music machine - More concerts please!
Congratulations, you're over 100 years late inventing the player piano
OMG, it's a fucking mechanical PID How?
Since when did Jukka from the Dudesons start making science shorts
When your optimally autistic
Dude is slowly going into steampunk😂
has this guy met the strandbeest guy... i think they could give birth to actual solar punk together
But doesn't the human side actually give the song some life as it's just sequencing and you might as well just be doing this on a computer
Primary gooblebox. Now expand and develop your own Microverse battery.
I know this is amazing, I'm just not sure I understand why...
Bro you laugh like a mad genius
Please remove auto dub on your videos i realy love all what you du but auto dub realy break everything.
This is not the best thing you've ever made. The best thing was the first marble machine, because it actually made good music.
Congratulations! You invented the wound clock 😁
This probably is the hardest thing youve made. As fitting together tons of little iterative solutions that are just time consuming is onky a test of patience and ability to keep having new ideas. This is more like straight up engineering
So he made a Full Bridge Rectifier
I don't know I thought the beauty lied and a small errors and make as a human. But I'm sure you will still make great music just more accurately
I'm happy for you to have been able to solve a problem you were on for such a long time.  But on the other hand, I found beauty in the random tempo you operating the machine manually was making. Every song was unique in that sense, even tho it was the same patern
Reminds me of the automatic ragtime piano that turns the human pedal input into a continuous output. Neat that you came up with something invented ages ago
Bros making a gooble box
Bro invented a mechanical capacitor holy crap lol
I want human music, with all its flaws and inconsistencies....this is digital music that could be more simply made on a computer. The "human tempo" is what makes music beautiful
8 years already.  I love your music and engineering talent.  Thank you for the gift.
Now miniaturize this and build a bicycle that uses this technology. A bicycle like that would use this - including a gear box - would probably win every bicycle race.
Cant wait to see what this looks like when yoh finish this. This is one of the coolest things ive ver seen a Human build
I thought bro created a banger and dipped. But he been cooking for years now
You go dude!  Can't wait to see the machine powered by this madness 🤪
Yes but, that's exactly what makes music emotional, the imperfections... Enjoy the techno you'll produce, I wont
sir, the cadence of your output of your arm is priceless and gives your music a character. smoothing it out will ruin it..
What’s funny is in the first few seconds looking at the guy I thought, “is this the guy who did the marble machine” and was surprised when I was right, even though I haven’t seen it in years
We got mechanical AC/DC full wave rectification before GTA6
Crazy Martin!
sad, its has lost the art and charm of a being an inherently lossy and expressive way of music, just use a speaker at some point.
Now a spring for power. Or a chain with buckets pulling the axle. The expended balls drop in the baskets, making the chain pull downwards. You just need to put it in motion. Bad side, you cant recycle the balls upwards.
Look up old self playing piano from the 1800s. They use air vacuum and an actuator that regulated the speed of the music so no matter how fast or slow you are on the vacuum pedal it turned at the same speed
Finally, .y restless foot syndrome will be productive
The first machine i think with all its so called "flaws" is such a fascinating sounding instrument... I think the search for perfect might destroy that.
I'm impressed you're still doing this
super nice
Props to you for sticking to this I remember seeing that old video years ago
As a mechanical engineering student: Idk why you did it idk how you did it. All i know is that it is awesome and I have to avoid that rabbit hole
I am starting to believe that MMX will never be finished.
This guy looks like he murders people in his spare time.
“the design is very inhuman”
Dude, you will never finish this machine if you continue to hunt for perfection.
You are a mad genius! The player piano, which uses paper with holes to allow air in which activates actuators that plays the piano, it has a brain that does exactly what you’re doing here. That might be an interesting thing to look at as well!
Wow
I totally forgot he's making wintergarten 2
This guy is linear. He solved an nonexisting problem. Its like building an underwater bridge. Useless.
I think the human speed control is cool.  That way, you can speed up or slow down for effect.
I think I would lean towards using the pedals to  wind a spring at any input rate and then use the spring to drive the machine at a regulated speed like a watch.
The tool you're looking for is a computer :)
"Smoothens"?
THIS IS HUGE!
Bruh it’s been like a decade
Surely an escapement would work
full bridge rectifier?
As a mechanical engineer I can think of many ways to solve this problem but to see someone working with their hands and tinker with things until it does what they want is just as incredible. Bravo sir
This was figured out back in the 1800’s with self playing pianos.
I assume it's a similar system that's used in vintage self playing pianos that work, with the person alternating the pedals while sitting on the bench? They have it running through a governor/gear setup that makes it to it doesn't matter if you're running a marathon or (kind of) casually alternating the pedals, the drum still rotates the correct tempo.
Well done! Go for it
If he put a cat there, then he'll have infonite energy
Blacks can't comprehend this.
My guy air powered pianos had this tech in the 1800s
Basically a mechanical watch
Its a rectifier, but instead of rectifying AC waves to a flat DC line, its rectifying the uneven force oscilations to a constant slope of force. I think I expressed that right... but not sure. Regardless, that's some really nice work my dude.
I never thought I'd see you again, it's been so many years...
A flooblegrank! Unlimited power for those suckers living in my car engine but more importantly, unlimited power for my car engine 😎
Why is this underrated?
I'll be checking in for the next machine to come out no matter how long it takes, that first one was so memorable I can hear it in my head as well as any song from my youth.
I can't express how happy this makes me. I listen to the original video quite often. That music machine changed the way I view music and creativity. Thank you for sharing your wonderful art and I'm looking forward to hearing more. But I would be happy listening to the first one forever too
This tech already exists much smaller in a player piano
didn't they solve this problem with the player piano 100 years ago already?
Fantastic news Martin. Congratulations.
I love the dedication, *BUT* at what point are you no longer building a machine to solve a problem, but rather creating problems to build a machine?
He looks like a cat making biscuits
Holy shit I watch your channel occasionally since probably more than a decade at this point and it’s insane to see how far you came.  Like the first time I watched I was impressed but now look at this thing it’s so much more elaborate. Love it.
Elon Musk’s illegitimate brother
Watching this at the office was a bad idea
Nice knipex
I think you should find a way to combine both. The human tempo being uneven provides a level of captivation and if your machine has no variance in tempo it won't have that magical sound. You should definitely do what you think is best but if everything is in perfect sync it may sound too machine and less organic.
Keep chasing your perfect machine. I am enjoying the ride immensely.
Damn thought we would never get another one turns out bros been cookin this whole time
So a constant force mechanism? Remontoire
Your laugh
I feel like the variation in tempo was part of what made it magical and unique. This is super cool as well.
Robbaz cousin
player piano did this over 100 years ago. way to copy someone else's homework.
Maybe your grandkids will finish the machine!
WTF
Is this also how a player piano works?
Awesome
Haven't seen this guy on the internet since I was 8 years old. Then he just pops up!
Basically like a mechanical watch movement? Load energy into a spring (or springs) which will release energy at a controlled rate using some form of escapement.
That just sounds like slavery with extra steps
dude, that is so awesome
I feel like you're going to end up accidentally reinventing that one wacky contraption piano that they used to use for movies. Hit it Joe!
The World's First Analog-Multithreaded Machine
where is Adam Savage?
This is so cool! Ur building a AAW not a DAW 😂
I still regularly listen to the first marble machine, cant be more excited for this new one. I will patiently await for it
This is beautiful, it reminds me of the old player pianos ❤❤❤
Redesigning the machine again eh? You're so obsessed with perfection you might as well just get on stage and start a MIDI sequence then sit down. Live music is all about the human element, it's not supposed to be perfect, it's supposed to be art.
The solution to this was solved centuries ago though... player organs solved this problem 150+ years ago, for example
du är jävligt duktig!
This is incredible.
A mechanical vfd... thats awesome
you sir are a genious.
This is absolutely astounding man! Keep up the good work!
So cool
isnt that slavery with extra steps?
Aww but i liked the "human quality" to the machine
Way to go, Martin! Congratulations! ❤🎉😊
man vs machine, dont forget that humans put the details in their imperfections
Dude you are way too smart for this. I believe in you I can’t imagine what you could do with a $$$ flow
He probably teaches calculus 20 at a university in his spare time.
Bro made an analog capacitor
CAn I use this design and try to make a working flying machine with it? Or you think its just too heavy already
Yay, wintergatan is doing shorts now
the universe is drifting... just go with the flow. no grids.
Bro is literally getting an engineer degree live on yt. I got bored after 6 years and 3rd abandoned machine.
Bro made a doohickey
Mister, You bring a serious ingeneering into the music.... Epic!! 😮😊
I always thought your original machine needed a bigger hand-crank. Obviously that would have altered the tempo, but watching you struggle with it was a bit painful . . .
Pice of crap
You should put those gears on a bike
So you copied an old time piano that plays music automatically and does this identical task of converting uneven input into even output 100 years ago?
Good to see you posting again!
Dont forget, perfect music isn't tight as a machine. The human part makes it perfekt.
Nice dude!  I look forward to the steel ball test!
From: "Look guys marbles make music!" To: industrial revolution
Holy crap!!!! Congrats.
It's true!  Only it was powered by air 'suction', no joke!  Google 100+ year old, suction powered, player piano.😊
every time someone says the word hyperbolic i get really confused because like, you are not a hyperbola!
I been watching hing this guy for years, been doing NOTHING except get BETTER AND BETTER!!!
be honest, how rich are your parents? you should explain to young people more that's how these things usually work
When he is done he has a MIDI sequencer made from wood… and then restarts again to reinsert soul into the music…
It's so sad how far you've fallen into engineering for engineering's sake. You used to be an artist, now you make overengineered metronomes
Save rhis guy❤
pushing pedals makes it look like a cat kneading biscuits
im going to live to see this so this is nice.
I cannot wait for marble machine 2.0
Player pianos figured this out centuries ago
Şu aleti yaparken yaşlandın be
Please wear a white lab suit and bad hair
Oh cool! I saw the marble machine video years ago cross posted to another platform and now I naturally found the OG Artist!
Would probably be handy for a wave electric generators
Yeah you've essentially done what an engine does. Good job, you discovered how to do what has been done for a couple hundred years
I'd like a more detailed breakdown of the mechanism
why even have a human at that point just do it electric do it digital just have a program that plays music on your pc
The slight drag and rush of tempo from human input is what makes music so captivating! It's a cool solution for the drifting, but I think you might find that you prefer making music that isn't _perfect_ tempo
big fan, love the engineering, but I always felt the inconsistency of the machine added a lot of charm to the music being played.
are we actually get a marble machine song 2? or is this slowly becoming an never ending cycle of improving?
This guy is the most useless person i have ever seen, noone cares about your stupid machine
This man is fascinating
Walmart will hire you homeless
The whole reason the first was so intriguing was BECAUSE of the imperfections. If you want perfectly timed music then just do it on a computer
Delayed gratification at its peak!
This will dehumanize when playing that's terrible
@AaronPaulsen
Try PC
It's been a long journey, and I've enjoyed all of it
Didn't old pneumatic player pianos have a system that made sure the music roll was pulled through in an even tempo?
No me quiero morir sin verlos en vivo en México 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Excellent!   I think you just caught up with the steam engine ca. 1760....  with a governer.   Sorry..  I could'nt resist.
I’m not sure “tight” is the best word here. In a musical context, “tight” usually refers to how well musicians play in sync with each other, rather than the steadiness of the tempo itself. While tight musicians often have a strong sense of timing, the term doesn’t directly describe tempo stability. In the case of your machine, the different instrument and rhythm parts are always perfectly in sync relative to each other, even if the overall tempo fluctuates. I wouldn’t normally point this out, but since you emphasize the word quite a bit in the longer version of the video, I thought it was worth mentioning—just an observation. (Maybe I am just missing the fact that you are repurposing the word to describe how your machine’s tempo works.)
But the unevenness is like the human element of music? I wouldn’t want all music to be made by machines.
😍🥰🥳🛸   Nice 🤗
That uneven input power aided in the sound of the machine though
Then 10 years later everything is electric powered and the marbles are replaced with lcd screen cause gravity and human power just doesn't make the cut
I do wonder if there is actually any music! The first machine was brilliant. Flaws and all!!!
This time use a Presonus R32 Digital mixer as your capture device.  It will allow you to use a single CAT6 cable to transmit all your channels without a snake using AVB Networking.  Each performer can also connect with their iPhone to the R32 and dial in their own IEM mix.  That way you can keep all your mic runs super short, and kill the snake forever...  It also will allow you to use one USB cable to connect the R32 to a DAW for further processing.  You may also consider adding MIDI triggers to capture as well, so those could also be sent to QLC+ to DMX lighting universe. 32 Channel Audio + MIDI + DMX for lighting automation.  You could also make your programming wheel have extra channels to control lights, if you wanted to change lights via the programming wheel.  The digital mixer virtualized and automates the mixer console, making it perfect for road shows.
Rather than scissor pedals, wouldn’t bike pedals be easier to use while operating the machine? Would use fewer, simpler parts too
Those pedals are safer than the last big one made of wood lol
I really like that video, I have it saved in a playlist, I should even save it on a pendrive because it would be sad to lose it forever. It really is something that can only be done by someone with a lot of talent and dedication.
Years from now some engineer will end up needing this for some critical piece of technology.
Just buy a motor, come on now.
I bet his wife left him

For all the armchair designers; creating a unique machine is difficult, critizing is easy, go build something,
The most highly researched "tick" ever! More man-hours than the atomic clock!!!
But a simple snail spring wouldn't do that ?
😎
Obsessed with perfection, when humans aren't perfect... but I guess it's a machine after all, and it's kinda the point
It’s the best thing you ever made because it’s one of the few you ever finished!
I worry that you’re going to end up off balance if you plan to stand on the pedals while trying to play. It would be like trying to play while going up stairs for 3-5 minutes straight
You might want a bit a variability in your music, though
I so hope this will work with the variable power consumption of his machine in the real world.
No elbows were harmed in the making of this video
Martin, while I absolutely love the passion and devotion. At some point you gotta cook another prototype that is fully functional and finished. A machine you can upgrade every year until you can't. And you build a new one with the new specs. Like building a PC, or designing a car. There is charm in imperfection.  The difference between a perfect inverted rollercoaster with perfect turns and a croaking shaking wooden coaster. Guess which one is going to trigger the fantasy for most men, wondering if they could do/build it as well.  Build and finish model 3. And never stop fantasizing about project 4. Treat it like your official 1.0 marble machine release. And build DLC until you need a sequel.
Congratulations you just removed human emotion from the machine.
Ironin i att försöka göra levande musik och i processen försöka ta bort allt liv.
OMG, our music teacher used to show this guy's videos when we were kids, that was like 8 or 9 years ago in 4th grade, now I'm studying at the university...
maybe this is what you want but the more human you take out of your machine the more i cant help but question "why not just do everything digitally?"
This build regulate speed. But as with Electricity, you cannot have perfect voltage for every given current. So you achieved perfect speed with constant torque load.  This is an input for another stage that can withstand torque variation. Luckly, mecanicaly this a doable with gear ratios (unlike electricity).
At what point are you just gonna invent the transistor and build a synthesizer lol Amazing work!
What an exciting breakthrough!
That mad scientist laugh says it all
The beauty of your first machine was the fact that it just worked. Now you are trying to make something that I think even you don't know what it is. Are you trying to make a music playing machine or just wasting time with experimentations on perfecting specific parts of a machine that will never be ready because of this constant and eternal upgrading???
Make it out of wood . . . be happy . . . Make an instrument to make music and go on tour.
For a couple seconds he be looking like a pleased cat making biscuits 😂
Im glad to say ive been here since the first marble machine, and i cant wait to see how the next might be! Im so glad to see such an amazing idea get refined again and again to make a masterpiece!
I have loved watching your videos and learning from you over the years.  Thank you for letting us to take this journey with you and where it all goes next.
The marble machine went from an instrument to a funny looking physical midi program and i don’t like it.
You look like a cat pawing at its pillow. XD
***********   ***  best ever   ***

Vilket geni du är 🤹🌌🙌🏼
The dial looks so cute lol
fast forward another 8 years,,still working on another version
I am too busy taking care of other people but this looks like something my bloodline would enjoy doing.  I am so happy you experience it and react because my reaction would be just as joyous 😊🪶 I hope you invent good things with applications for veterans or animals and maybe even the Amish ☘️ I appreciate you for you.

Now I want victory flavoured chips
Bra jobbat!
seeing you back on my screen years after i got invested in the MMX videos, with a solution to the tight playing... I feel proud for someone ive never met LOL
This is so awesome
toot ta toot!
