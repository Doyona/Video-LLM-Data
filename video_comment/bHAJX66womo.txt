Love Trump!! ❤❤❤
Was he in the army , or did he chicken out allready back then ?
I am sorry to say but it’s not a proper solute trump should join the army
Draft Dodger salutes without wearing the uniform. Pathetic. Ronald Reagan started this tradition and even President Eisenhower, formerly General Eisenhower did NOT SALUTE anyone when he wasn't in uniform.  Reagan did this because HE NEVER SERVED in the regular Army. He was in the National Guard during WW2, and made training films.   HE started saluting the marines at the steps of the presidential helicopter and it made for great photo-ops.  Fat Donald the coward is not man enough to actually serve in anything but a prison chow line.
Im not a fan of someone spinning the star spangle banner. Just sing it with  enthusiasm and power.
MAGA !!
Surprised that Trump was not booed, I am glad that he was not booed at all
America is already back, now Western Civilization is gonna be fixed
trump never got the attention he was wanting so he just left mid game
Bro I just overheard someone say IN REAL LIFE, not online, Fox News altered the audio and put in cheers when they actually booed him and just came to this video to check if it was true💀 these ppl r crazy with TDS I swear. I wonder if bro is on Reddit or something idk where he got that info. I want to show him the video of this but I literally just overheard him and maybe it’d be weird
Never served a day in his life. Called soldiers who died in battle suckers and losers. Have you all forgotten that?
America has awoken from the woke nightmare of un-American ess
As a former Democrat, it makes me cry tears of joy to see for the first time in a long time a President who loves this country and everything we stand for with all of his heart. 0:14
The commander-and-chief salutes the flag. Why is this headline like it's a wrong thing to do?
Captain America
Trump is so disrespectful
So how many tax dollars is this costing maybe musk and DOGE can cut those costs
Just another way of wasting the government and tax payers money while claiming to be saving it.
😴  Boring 😴
Send this artical to Musk. He will buy 🇨🇦 with his pocket change.
Funny thing is that people absolutely don’t care what Hollywood thinks anymore.
🤡
Thats how you show love and respect to your flag as an American. Not to other countries flag waved in your soil or other unknown flags.
the Commander in Chief is not a member of the military. The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief, but is a civilian who is elected by the people.
He never served 😮 bone spurs. You can’t salute
It’s free speech you tube that’s the law
❤Trump🇺🇸
America is happy with their decision 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The feldgrau uniforms of the soldiers are very suitable for this occasion. Especially when supreme leader drumpf is present.
I love Trump I don’t care what anybody else thinks it’s my choicen
I love how all the NFL boycotters have something to say about this game.
He had to salute because he doesn't have a heart to place his hand over!!
They Cut the Audio of him getting Booed, those cheers are 110% false
"Through the perilous fight" is when Trump shows up, absolutely perfect
Typical left wing media coping and crying
10's of millions of dollars it has tax payers so 'Donald delusional thinks everyone likes me Trump' could attend the super bowl. What a waste money that could have been used for bettering the people. Well done dumb Donny voters !!
Seems like older veterans will remember his dad paying his way out. America is separate. Now more then most years. I really wish America comes out on top. But not the top Luffy from the straw hats is fighting.
This sounds fake.. anyone there that can tell what it actually sounded like.. depending on where in the arena you were obviously
Trump and his family looked so ridiculous at the superb owl, so ridiculous!  They were booed like dogs that they are.  People hate hate those people.
Why do they continue to put these awful national anthem performers? Such a beautiful song when sung the right way. That wasn’t the right way.
Captain Bone Spurs has NO right to salute. The pathetic traitor is not only too cowardly to realize this but too narcissistic and ignorant to as well!!!!
Weirdest human on earth. He should be in a care facility.
So Trump never attended Super Bowls, even during his last presidency. What changed this time?
Speakers Pumping cheers into the crowd is wild. You can totally tell. You would’ve heard the boos more if it wasn’t for that. 😂
The crowd roaring for the president brought a tear to my eye.
Americans = “TrUmP gOt aLL thE CheErs!!” Well done, the world doesn’t give af loll
CiC salutes he doesn't put hand over heart. It is not rocket science.
Yeeeah Trumpy baby 😂😂😂
This was one of the worst renditions of the anthem I have ever heard
Is jon batiste wearing shriner pins, 32 degree mason
As supreme commander he is allowed to do that
Not okay with a criminal saluting. Especially not with fake cheering.
Actions of a school yard bully. He is a military wannabe. He would love to be able to strut a general's uniform...instead he will settle for stolen valour.
Hes not in the military
But he is a draft dodger
As a vetren of the U S Army I don't think a draft dodger that made fun of a Vietnam prisoner of war should have the honor of even being the president, but we have what we have and this country is hiring already
0:20 Hail Hydra
That’s a bad solute and you only solute when your wearing your cover.  But, he’s the commander and cheif so I guess he can do whatever he wants
Where is Chris stapleton when you need him the most? That was terribly sung!
So, he’s saluting the armed service and our flag? The same people he called suckers and losers? What a rotten, hypocritical pos!
“We are very proud for Jalen Hurts, Nick Sirianni, and this entire team.  They have persevered greatly, answered their critics amazingly, and proved themselves to be undoubtedly the best team this season.  The character and swagger of this Eagles team was something truly special to behold. “
🇺🇸TRUMP THANK YOU 🎉
Belic Clown
He is supposed to put his hand over his heart. He looks so ridiculous that someone who has bone spurs doesn't  have respect for the military at all.  What a joke 😂😢😮😅😊😊😊😅😮😢😂
Trumpppppppppppp  Fredoonnnnnnn 🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Bone spur Donny saluting? What a slap in the face.
Absolute Garbage! There is only one way to sign it and that BS is not the way. FO
It cost taxpayers $15 million for this fake to attend this game.  Not an official duty. He needs to pay for this.
I do believe that is the worst national anthem singer ever
Trump your all fake
TRUMP VERSUS THE PEOPLE GOVERNMENT
😂😂
Too bad Beyonce was not at the super bowl, so she could get booed too!!!!!!
What a great country ❤ respect from Taiwan !
A draft dodger salutes the flag. How disgraceful.
Trump cheered Swift booed  All is right in tthe world
he know what he do 👍
Fox should be busted for playing canned audio cheers over the national anthem performance.  My friends in Sweden and Finland that were watching the live stream said they heard some boos…..NO CHEERING AT ALL!! The give away is it comes on too strong and fades out with the perfectly timing the video clip.  FAKE!!!
This gives me goosebumps. Amazing to see him there
Hate that version. Why not sing it the way it was written. Must they bastardize it.
That what a Commander in Chief does lead by example
Its crazy how manybl people are claiming those were boos
Trump did right he's the president
The song should have sang d proper way
And the crowd goes wild!!!!!!
First, what rendition is that? Second, people saying that the Commander in Chief should not salute if he didn't serve? I would like to point out that Obama did the same thing.
The cheers were canned to cover the boos
Hot garbage you still owe restitution from Otta Banga NY Post we all see you too.
WHY CAN I NOT FIND A VIDEO OF THE APPLAUSE. Quit silencing reality!
Ive gotta be honest this is a weak salute but you know not everyone who leads served
You edited the audio when Trump was shown. It is clearly fake. Why would you do that? The acoustics aren't even close to the same. I'm curious of how bad the actual boos were; you should post the actual audio.
Eww
Love trump man! We’re so back!
LOVE YOU TRUMP!!!!!!!! Great man.
0:18 the best presidente of USA
the criminal and his personnal barbie
But Reddit told me every single person they know that voted for Trump hates him and instantly regrets it 3 weeks into office..? Even though he’s doing everything he said he would?? Can someone explain?
The woke are losing the culture war
Someone please teach him how to do it right.
OK you people who think Trump is hated by most of America. Here he is cheered at the Super Bowl. Yeah, almost 77 million people voted for someone they hate.
His arm position is about 45 degrees off.
This, Taylor Swift got booed and Chiefs lost. It was a great night🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
POS don’t have a ❤
Change is real!!
Trump didn't pay for his Super Bowl trip. We, the taxpayers did. Keep your freaking hands off our money you dipstick!!
Should draft dodgers be saluting?
HAPPY BLACK HISTORY MONTH! 😊 Black history IS AMERICAN history! 🇺🇸  Some don’t have to accept being “poorly educated!” Let each one….TEACH one!  STAY WOKE, FOLKS! 🙏🏼🙌🏼  GOOOOOOOOOO 🦅 🦅🦅🦅 BLACK EXCELLENCE on display against the backdrop of 🍊 MEDIOCRITY!
I see our new and improved future SS military cadets are gearing up for Trump's Amerika. yikes!
❤
So are the rest of us going to get our races represented like this? No of course Native Americans wouldn't get this treatment. Or Asians or Latinos. Just the loudest cry babies get the special treatment.
Felon
Trump should not salute.  He never wore a uniform!  It’s an insult to our military!
Was Tommy Tuberville there to watch his former player, Patrick Mahomes?
Trump is a shame for such a glorious sports event and for this once great country. A lying old facist with cheap orange make-up. At least Lamar ate Trump alive on stage and stood up. Land of the free & home of the brave. These words don´t mean much anymore these days with a clown as president.
He didn't even salute correctly
That has to be the worst national anthem performance ever 😂😂😂
Only here for TRUMP!!! Hahaha Taylor swift got booed. Hahahah
❤🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
Trump don't need to the super bowl
Trump's a freak
I love my country!
you do realize the crowd was mostly rich people in the top tax bracket? The same groups he is offering tax breaks to? Last i checked the average american in the 60% lower wealth bracket cant afford 5000 dollars for a single nose bleed section ticket. The superbowl is a pageant these days for the wealthy. No wonder why he was cheers. Us non rich have to watch from home and his tax breaks have done nothing for us. But you all are here cheering i love how he called Kendrick a DEI the grammy award winning Pulitxer price winning been around for 2 decades kendrick. I am sorry calling a black man who is bery successful on his own a DEI is saying if you are black and rich you are definitely a DEI no other way to even absorb that. That is racist what he posted.
At least he's not sniffing children
Dude, last year I got some crazy gains: 50x on Kas, 15x on INJ, and 20x on Pepe (I got out way too early). Folks, forget about Dyno Coin. Do your own research (DYOR) and invest in new projects. My next bet is Trumnix. Time will tell if I was right—just like how we KNEW the Eagles would win this year!
Switched camera angles quick lol
Touchdown in my portfolio! I've just bought 100,000 TRUM tokens (Trumnix project). It's going to make me a millionaire in a year!! Eagles won, now it’s time for Trumnix to fly high!
My top pick for bull run: XRP, SOL, TRUM (Trumnix)… just like my Eagles were the top pick for Super Bowl LIX!
That’s what a president does! 🇺🇸
This is like a comic show.
He may want to sit down with those bone spurs!!
The only Chief worth watching that night was the Commander.
I never once even heard about this singer till last night Super Bowl
Look the lost daughter appeared to be with her convicted felon daddy 😂😂
Who is he saluting?
Notice when Trump appeared on-screen the whole stadium cheered him!
Sure, the draft dodger and the person so well known for his disdain of our armed forces salutes. What a joke.
Did you hear the roar from the crowd for Trump? Enough said. The first president to attend a Super Bowl. And was standing and saluting. For the people by the people.
I thought etiquette was to only salute if you're in uniform?
Trump is a chinese puppet
A man of the people
Where did captain bone spurs learn how to salute?!
The draft dodger saluting.
libtards are actually saying that he got booed. 😂
He salutes because he has no heart😿
Which salute did Elon during this?
Why would you overlay a crowd cheering over trump?
Chris Stapleton. 'nuff said
Sounds like an overwhelming cheer to me. Where there people booing? I dont doubt it, but they were drown out by cheers.
How is an African American Anthem not racist?
Worst national Anthem i've ever heard.
That's my president!!
He dodged the draft FIVE TIMES and called our military SUCKERS AND LOSERS!
They edited the booing against loooooool 😂
👏👏👏🇺🇸USA 🇺🇸USA 🇺🇸USA
He can’t find his heart…
NO KNEES HERE!
They booed Taylor swift once again fake news 😂
This national is so basic and boring..🤮
MY 3 YEAR OLD NEPHEW DOES IT BETTER!
Whst does Trump know about saluting having been dedicated to avoiding military service he is a parody predident it makes a mockery of the office.
He showed up for propaganda cant not even salute correctly
Memo to Muskrat: while everyone else is distracted by discussing the appropriateness of the salute,  how much wasteful spending was incurred by the convicted felon/liar in chief and his family to attend the Super Bowl, inclusive of preplanning Secret service travel expenses? Provide a report to the news media for release by 5pm today. Thanks.
He don’t care about troops his salute is fake
Now play the raw audio 😂😂😂
As a native to the UK, I don't want to leave, but America is looking very, very attractive right now!!
You chickenshit b**** saluted through the national anthem you never served a day in your life neither is under your p**** sons are you just proved to yourself that you're a f****** idiot
crowd went crazy when they showed trump on the screen, it's true. I was there
That’s our President and CIC!
The president is commander in chief. President's historically salute. To not, and to not put your heart over your heart says you are not american. Yes it's actually a thing. Glad I got what I voted for. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
He shouldn't be saluting because he never served in the army
He’ll salute at the superbowl, but won’t put his hand on the Bible when being sworn in…. Scumbag fraud
When the cheers went up for Trump, the camera was quickly switched.  LOL!
He commands the strongest Military in the world. He can salute! Ooooorah
Meat head was at the Spuerbowl???🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
At least he put the proper hand up.
Notice how the crowd Cheered from Trump and Boo Tayler swift? Yeah the super bowl doesn't lie unlike CNN
What salute was Elon doing?
Best president we have had in our generation
The man just loves his country and respects the people who fight for it. Unlike some people and the one's criticizing him for doing it
He is THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. 🇺🇲🦅
BOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!
I actually didn’t mind the New Orleans style jazz rendition of the national anthem. It was pretty cool and made sense.
Wooooow I like this version… it sounds so jazzy, warming etc..❤❤❤
Felon in chief Trump..America weeps.
Sound guy said “cue the applause!!” 😂
Our National Amthem is not a love song
Draft Dodger 🤮
As a veteran and not a bone spur draft dodger I know a salute is something you do to your hat.  It is hand over heart with no hat.
Trump got massive cheers and Taylor swift got booed 🥲🫠
Thats why the Chiefs did NOT win. Hey birds😅
❤ MAGA❤
I know why trump doesn’t put his hand over his Heart is because  He doesn’t have One!
Why not throw his heart out?!! I mean if thats really what Musk meant!!! Lol. Hes a troll, not. President.
Salute THIS! 🤮🤡🤮🤡🤮🤡🤮
Trump booed, bigly
Trump, America’s biggest nightmare ever
Stop saluting you draft dodging coward. How dare you disrespect ACTUAL service memebers by that bs salute. You never served anything but yourself. Those shin splints must've really been rough. 🐈🐈🐈
LETS GO TRUMP
The President was shown on the jumbotron and the crowd roared! Not a Fu or a boo to be heard.
Oh look everyone its the draft dodger.
Trump has always been drawn to wealth and power, so it’s no surprise he fawns over the Saudi royals. They’ve been buying up sports teams to distract from their human rights abuses, and since they love attending games, Trump must think that’s part of the whole “wannabe king” routine. Plus, he has major FOMO—like someone desperate to get their picture in the paper.    So, of course, he showed up at the game, only to take a petty swipe at Taylor Swift, who was just there to support her boyfriend. Eagles fans probably booed her, but Trump? He definitely heard the real “boos”—and they came with middle fingers.
Trump shook that hand, and they lost bigly.
That camera cut so quickly when they heard the cheers! Liberal Media
Flips-the Coin from blue 2  Almighty Red The-White House The-Senate The-House The-Supreme Court The- Popular vote It’s all about Attitude problem oriented from personality disorder  Last 4 years:  * 2024: $1.83 trillion  * 2023: $1.7 trillion  * 2022: $1.376 trillion  * 2021: $2.772 trillion Tariffs  (Must)  When Jon Kennedy exposed the USAID money laundering scheme it is unbelievable how much dollars  this criminal organization spends and all of them behind this programs are the crooked criminals & Thieves & the conman who cheats or tricks someone by gaining their trust and persuading them to believe something that is not true the  Bernie Sanders always complaining about OLIGARCHS what they did for the last 4 years  "We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.

Him getting cheered at the CTE bowl actually quite fitting💀
What a terrible singer for the national anthem
No one cares about this orange piece of garbage.
Captain Bone Spurs
TOTAL FAKE AND A TOTAL FRAUD!!
Didn't he leave at the half because the scary black men made fun of him?
More like North Korea every day  !
Wow Trump got loudest cheers of entire night and Swift was booed out of the building; literally  😂😂😂😂
Sleepy joe would’ve slept through the entire event
I like the anthem. And Trump saluted the army.
NO MORE KNEES DOWN !!
Bone spurs commando 🫡
Saluting the military isn't offensive at all! He is showing his appreciation and respect.
Will anybody ever over perform Whitney at a Super Bowl ? I don’t think so
What a poser trumpo the clown is.
LEGEND!!
What a clown, and a Clown rag of a paper, the New York Joke.
The Gong Show continues.
Who is the woman left?
I’ve seen so many leftists say he was booed? Is the boo in the room with us or is the left creating lies again?
The American people just love Trump because they finally have someone fighting for them instead of worrying about what foreigners think or anti-Americans who have taken the country for granted.
First POTUS to attend the superbowl and first to salute old glory in front of the world.
Como pueden aplaudir a ese tarado?
Did it even show Taylor? Did she take a knee? She couldn't put her hand over her heart because she doesn't have one. 😂
and this is news because?
Suggest he read the Constitution rather than show up for photo ops.
Haters will always be haters.  Just ignore their stupidity.  They are all hypocrites!
The Fall of Roman Empire as it finest
They screamed for Ivanka
Sang soulfully
Why does this Loser salute? He didn’t do the military.
I pray to my Lord and Savior Jesus  that he will not inspire another January 6 Riot  and that he upholds his  Oath of Office.
Im surprised the Coward Draft Dodger knows how
Think Reddit will post this?? 😂😂
The amount of delusions in this comment section
not a great rendition of the anthem
He was BOOED walking to his seat!!! So funny y'all twisted the story!! He was BOIED & CALLED A TRAITOR!!!
All the football players , regardless of race , should have knelt . Bunkerbitch doesn't deserve using a military salute . Hes a bone spurs draft dodging 😼
West Point Cadets uniforms look like Starship Troopers or Star Wars Imperial Officer uniforms lol
Nothing to be proud of
The national anthem butchered thanks to DEI.
That was scripted u so her hand!
Thank you sr !
Head of the biggest terrorist organization
🇺🇲 👍✨️
THATS MY PRESIDENT 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
He did a fine job on the national anthem. Too bad we couldn't have a musical artist for halftime, but ghetto boys will have to suffice
Proud! is all I can say.. America is back to normality.
What happened to MAGA puppets boycotting the "woke" NFL and never going back? 😂 🤡
Bone spur Donny, America's most famous draft dodger and phony patriot, pulling a military salute during the national anthem. Shameless.
AMERICA IS BACK!!!!!!!
🤡🤡🤡
Ah, there is nothing like the star mangled banner.
Bone spurs.
The ENTIRE THING WAS DISCUSSING & PLANET EMBARRASSMENT
Why is hd saluting anyway???? Superbowl is not a military event.........yet.
What an embarrassment for your country......Trump the dictator!!!!!!
It's so refreshing to see America coming back together.
Thats the only poll you need. Sounded like over 72% approval right there
Well done President Trump you bring back Patriotism back to the nation !!
Can’t they get a better female singer.? Seriously 😳
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The revolution is about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy...
Can't anyone sing the National Anthem normally?
❤❤❤❤❤ trump
Yes Sir President Trump. Y Que  From Raider Nation.  RN4L
Why would anyone care?
A real commander in chief
Trump 2024!
My President! 💪
the usa is back and better than ever
David Draiman from band  Disturbed, would do the anthem with more power and charisma
Our President!
America is back and Swift got what she deserves.
Trump is a disgrace to my America and his gullible supporters have no place in it either.
America 🇺🇸 first
Beautiful rendition
The only ones saying he shouldn't is the swamp machine. You do you. Trump will do Trump.
crowd favorite
Love it!!!🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏
Why do the Americans have the tendency to butcher their anthem, why not just a simple military band with a powerful score
I live 2 mins from West Point academy. TRUMP 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Why was the national anthem changed?  Way too much creative lease given, sounded terrible.
He did not serve, ever. Shame on him.
Didn't Trump dodge the draft how many times, and he has the gall to military salute
One of the worst National Anthem sung, wish they just get someone who sings like normal.
booooooooo
THEY CHEERED HIM AND THEY BOO TAYLOR
LETS GO TRUMP!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Respect!
Where is the salute emote YT?
We need a new anthem and a new president
Some boos but definitely more cheers
CONMAN
Make America Great Again Uncle Trump👍
Land of the Free what a joke
He thinks people who serve in the military are suckers and losers. So, I'm not impressed.
The most American president in the history of America
Lol you just hear lots of noise. There's cheers and booes mixed for Trump. And the same goes for Taylor she is booed also because she was an Eagles fan and now she supports her boyfriend's Chiefs. Not everything is politics...Fake news...
Clown felon 😂
The great orange dictator
I reckon Ivanka would a Great President one day, she's beautiful and super smart
I don’t like your racism!
MAGA!!!!! 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷
Yes folk the president saluting during the National Anthem is news now
President Trump showing support for New Orleans and the tragic event that took place. Crowd went nuts when he was shown on big screen. Kendrick Lamar gave a perfect performance as well. Samuel L Jackson in the Stars & Stripes..! What a wonderful thing
B- eutiful
Why is dude crying.. No wonder chiefs lost.... They were not men enough from the onset
America’s back!🎉
Eu sou do Brasil e Trump é uma pessoa incrível, parabéns aos americanos que votaram nele vocês tem o melhor presidente do mundo , aqui no Brasil o presidente é um ladrão e bebado.
I thought he was saluting the guy who took down the "End Racism!" placards in the End Zones... ?  🤣
Just came to see Trump, there was no booing
I hope the eagles don't go to the white house
😢😂 Orange Jinx 🤮🤮😢
Am I tripping or do the cadets look like A.I
The cheer was more poignant than the salute
When will the media accept the people love Trump?
I love how there's such a stark difference between social media and reality. On social media, dems and libs are trying EVERYTHING to make it seem like no one likes Trump.   But in reality, everyone is cheering lol.
Apparently Trump did nothing wrong and neither did his family members who crossed their hearts.  "Whether you salute during the Star-Spangled Banner depends on your status:  Members of the armed forces: Salute when you hear the first note of the anthem.  Veterans: Salute if you prefer.  Civilians: Stand at attention and place your right hand over your heart."
Bone spurs saluted
He just wasted about half a million dollars of taxpayers money needlessly traveling to the Super Bowl instead of staying home and watching it on TV while claiming he is trying to reduce government wastefulness. What a load of BS. He has a lifelong history of very wasteful spending.
Trump is a worm
I thought conservatives swore off the NFL years ago? 🤔
What’s up with that cutting waist full spending. Fueling Air Force One costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour. In addition to fuel, the cost of operating Air Force One includes flight consumables, maintenance, and aircraft overhaul. Wages for secret service military and fuel for vehicles extravagant meals. His Super Bowl trip cost tax payers every bit of 2 million dollars.
He couldn't even stay for the whole game.  What a waste of money and man power  for a photo op.
we won...
Finally a president that cares about his country
a president should salute
That was strange...
Where’s Melania?
If you want to hear the loud cheers President Trump got at the Super Bowl when the camera was on him, while John Batiste played the Star Spangled Banner, you're better off looking at the New York Post video of it on YouTube.
0:19 were those nazis?
Trump a Real president
Notice how he wasn't checking his watch or nodding off..
President Trump is making America great again! 🫡 🇺🇸
A draft dodger salute?
trump is a national disgrace. Destroying America.
I mean, a regular civilian who never served a day in the military can salute the flag. Its called freedom of speech, you know, the first amendment that you swore to protect and defend 🤷‍♂️
Draft dodger in chief
Decrepit , old conman
And he got booed 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah!
Mafia president
People cheering American demise is incredible, Trump is using the same playbook in failed authoritarian regimes and the states have been exposed, the President can be above the law. No other president in the past has weilded thus much power especially focused on targeting internal opposition like a gang. Democrats need to grow and fight back.
What a fool, he was NEVER a soldier and he certainly isn't a leader.
Well at least he didn't zieg hiel this time. Probably keeping that indoors for now. Elon got a little too excited.
We only watched the game to see Presidente Trump.
Trump is nothing but another Zionist like Biden  another puppet and  the sheep will understand this  better later this year
Biggest pop of the night by far lol
Trump got a massive cheer! ❤️🫶🫶🫶
Während der Halbzeit abbauen. Super 🙄
Still got booed, wandered around on the field like he was lost, and left like halfway through the game
He saluted because he has no heart.
So inconsiderate that they had DEI performers at half time when the President was attending but he took it with grace as always.
Best president EVER
Sad to see such a uneducated, evil, racist man.  He deserves what's coming. Watergate 2 ,here we come!!!!!!🎉
they had to pan away from President Trump quick before the roar of victory drowned out the vanquished.
Where is Trump's wife?!
For the sake of "diversity," a discriminated and underrepresented person should have sung the national anthem -- specifically a heterosexual, Christian, white male.
Was Shane Gillis with the Westpoint recruits?
I smell DEI in this game. Shut it down.
America 🇺🇸 is back! We’re healing from these loonie liberals 😂
Pride in being an American! That’s what Trump stands for!
Beautiful deliverence. It reminds me of The Great Whitney Houston.
Wtaf is he doing lol
I heard Trump was dancing during the halftime show. lol😂
Commander and Chief of The US Military - Absolutely Allowed To Salute
WTH he saluting ,Mr trump you never served in military
The dumb Donny got booed at the game and was delusional when walking onto the field and then also got booed at numerous pubs around the country when he appeared on screen 🤣
New York Post are letting all the b o t s out of Left field in the comments for this one.
Go trump love from Canada 🇨🇦
Helluva lot better than the worst president in history Biden!!!!
Awful compared to last year.
How dare he salute our military? He’s a disgrace to this this nation.
Horrible anthem rendition, lets just be honest!! Geezman, who allows this stuff??
Gross people.  No excuses for voting for this chud. He desecrates our flag and sold out American families
Ivanka class knows how to dress. Swift looks like a middle age school kid tacky 😢
Captan America
This is such a great clip.  Thank you 🇺🇸
He's the CiC, he gets to salute. Move on.
He is so cute. Look at me I'm Trump 😂HIRRY UP FOUR YEARS 😂😂😂
The media keeps pretending like Americans don’t love him.
Hes not military he doesn't salute.idiot
Not a veteran Trump did not even get 50% of the popular vote. More than Harris, but less than half.
Go Trump!
Horrible rendition of the national anthem.
😂😂😂
Viva Trump
1. Palm showing 2. Arm is not vertical with the floor 3. Not even in the right position. If you’re gonna salute at least do it right 😔
🇺🇸
Trump's a traitor
Me wondering why everybody in the comments are saying the crowd was cheering Trump when they very clearly were bullying him and then I noticed that this video was posted by the New York Post, also known as Donald Trump News.
How ironic, a draft dodger saluting🙄
An OVERWHELMING Boo…Trump got roasted harder than Drake at this SuperBowl.
Cheers for Trump....not sure that rendition was appropriate for a high testosterone Super Bowl😂.
Oh Yeah Go 🦅
Idiot
I heard massive cheers when they showed Trump ❤
Trump is what the US and the world needed. The American taxpayer is resting easier knowing they aren’t being stolen from anymore. The over spending and laundering has been exposed as fact. Millions of people around the world are screaming, “we told you so!” The Americans should be furious with the Democratic Party. Embarrassing America. Selling out on America. They have been exposed. The money saved will go to America and humanity organizations around the world who are open book transparent.
MAGA🙏🇺🇸
U.S cadets have had sick drip for over 160 years !
Private Bone Spurs suddenly feels patriotic
Who is singing?
Here's our salute...
Trump cheered and Taylor booed. The crowd would have cheered longer but they cut the camera what a joke. Pathetic. The Dems are probably crying he got cheered.
Trump brought Ivanka instead of his wife! 😂😂😂😂
Lol maga really depends on crowd reaction.  I would too if a guy I supported was a fraud criminal😂😂😂
Didn’t he just have Jon Batiste fired from the board at the Kennedy Center? And has done nothing but take aim at minorities since stepping into office. He doesn’t care about America.
Where was the wifey ms TRUMP 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
All I hear are BOOS
That's My President 🔥🔥🔥
Cheers ❤
He’s the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces it’s appropriate to salute 🫡.
I can’t believe that Draft  Dodger is saluting!  What a phoney !!
Trump didn't give a proper salute. What a fraud.
What a hypocrite POS. Him saluting is a slap in the face to all people in the service.
America is back
Im proud that DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT!!!❤❤❤ WHO CARES ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT AND WHAT SHE THINKS!!!!!
Horrible annoying singing! NO respect to the National Anthem!
1/2 the crowd booed hard, but, the camera quickly panned out
I jeard a sudden onset of boos and then a playback of cheers  lol
Trump getting cheers gave me goosebumps after all he's been through this year. The two assassination attempts, the phony court hearings, the media witchhunt. Overcoming it all and his incredible start to his second term. Seeing him salute the flag with the whole crowd roaring with cheers. It feels like a scene out of Independence Day.
America!!!
Trump needs to learn a proper salute. I knew Drill Instructors that would grab your hand and put a hurtin on you showing the proper way. But, Trumps a draft dodger, so go figure!!!!
I hope we still keep our democracy 😢
Reàl man
Kamala doesn't watch foot ball.
Where's Melania ???😂
Im surprised 🍊 didnt poke himself in the eye.......😂😂😂
TRUMP!!!!!!
Title should say   (President Trump cheered during super bowl national anthem.)   Also Taylor Swift got booing into oblivion when they put her on the megatron 😂
Draft dodger Cadet Bone Spurs salutes the flag after walking all over the US Constitution for the last three weeks.
Nice prediction trump, wrong about that too.
ETTD
Trump loves KC!
Probably the worst National Anthem sung
Pensé que la era de la nazis había terminado
That was one of  the worst rendering of the  National Anthem   JMO
Captain bonespurs.😊
When you Love America; you put your hand on your HEART; not saluting in a military stance. This man didn’t even want to hug a disabled veteran.💙💙💙
So proud of be an American.
MAGA all the way at the Super Bowl!
Who....some random guy
Trump is trash I'm gladly they didn't let his presence ruin the game
Where was President Elon Musk? Why did they send Vice President Trump?
A draft dodger saluting 🫡.  What a joke
Donny diapers. Just looking for attention.
MAGAt’s on here delusional asl like always! 😩😆😆😆
Next time get a WHITE person who can ding it correctly.
33 seconds? Hmm
MAGNIFICENT ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🫡🫡🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
feels great to be on the right side of history
Quiet during the anthem then roaring cheers when Trump is cheered but I keep on reading he was booed by liberals.
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TRUMP
Another loss for Trump. He’s skilled at failure. More bankruptcies than any sitting politician.
Must’ve been ambient noise crowd cheers blasted from the speakers
Trump is disrespecting the military saluting when he was a coward dodging the draft disrespectful
TRUMP used his power to get out of serving so Maybe as President he is allowed to salute, I find it sad and offensive considering his lack of character and patriotism
I'll bet he made it all the way up there without falling down the stairs too!
MAGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is Trump going to tariff the Eagles now ?
Trump couldn't get a date so he had to bring his daughter. I think he once said, If he wasn't married he would be dating her.
The salute is a sign of respect for the troops, and isn’t uncommon. Take 2 seconds and google before you post. It’s free to use
Trump bag of salt for the Kansas City Chiefs jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja
What a coward traitor this man and his lowlife cult are
Lol, that dude is the goofiest JESTER EVER!!!!!
Stop trying to make Trump a nice person
LOLOL. That fake canned applause that Fox piped in. What a disgrace Murdoch is.
That's the reason why the Chiefs lost
Trump and his entire Family are disgusting Pigs!!!!
Yeah this a deep fake
If two Trumpers get divorced, do they still remain cousins?
Trump doing a great job 🫡
Love this !❤
The vocalist is a disgrace
Honestly, the fact that KC had such an epic loss and T Swift must be disappointed to say the least…Makes this so much better ‼️😎the romance will end soon and she will have a new song 😅
❤❤🇺🇸
Why is he 🫡? When he dismantling it?
The best president ever, there’s never been anyone like him. Such a great guy, a beautiful person   No one has done better
That grosses me out.
Typical of the mainstream media the president was not  recognized nor was his presence and reactions  displayed during the game.😮 In fact loser Swift and simp kelce were seen more than our president! We all know why. Because the uproar of President Trump's suppporters would have caused a delay of game!😅
Leftist = Communist who hate America.
Look at all the fake people. Everybody ready to stab each other in the back. Lol
So are dems going to stop watching the nfl?  It seems like they hate anyone or anything who agrees with him.
Boooooooo trump
WokeLiberals be screeching "Noooo, we need to hate our country, culture, people and everything associated with us and only celebrate outside cultures"
As he should,  being the Commander in Chief!
I heard he got booed.
▀▀█▀▀ .█▀▀█ .█─.█ .█▀▄▀█ .█▀▀█ ─░█── .█▄▄▀ .█─.█ .█░█░█ .█▄▄█ ─░█── .█─░█ .▀▄▀ ..█──░█ .█─❤🤍💙
They left out Taylor Swift getting booed
People are already rumoring that he got booed 😂
For all the wokesters denying trump being cheered. CBS just released poll numbers with trump having 53% popularity nationally. That’s not just nfl fans
Didn’t his daddy buy out the doctors so he can dodge the draft in the 70s??
But he’s  doing it wrong, his buddy Elon would tell him to do it with a more extended arm at a 130 degree angle
Did he salute during the colored national anthem??
And this is news because?
Trump was BOOED! 😂😂😂
That salute was spot on
Does he think he is a member of the military? Four years under his belt and he doesn't even fkg know the proper way for a CIVILIAN to address the flag during the national anthem?! I'll bet a crapload of illegal aliens even know that! What a senile old COOT!
TRUMP 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
Horrible rendition. 🫤🤮
Did he salute before or after they booed him?
Why do media say he got boos?. He got big cheers.
Lol now they all wanne be all emotional over your national anthem....lol
FDT what an embarrassment.
The crowd went nuts for trump and booed taylor. I love it
This person’s rendition is not to my liking. I appreciate President Trump and others respecting The National Anthem!!!
Thr highlight of the game was seeing Trump and our military . Half time entertainment was a disappointing performance.
THE CROWD WENT WILD 😅😊😅
Is that phony Ivanka? What a horrible person.
I dont know what was worse the Chiefs or the halftime show
He wasted millions of taxpayer dollars and left at half time, DOGE should shut the White House down
BOOOOOOOOOO
Trump is still and always has been a D-Bag
Who is he saluting? I've seen him do this before. To no one. He really is a dotard.
Oh no. A DEI sang the anthem. 😶
As an audio engineer those cheers where scripted just like wwe when they want to get someone over like Roman rains in 2018 you can easily Edit out boos in a life tv appearance. The actual game was more like a 50-50 of Cheering  and booing. But most keept silently out of respect
Down with DEI 👎. Don't like it, too bad. This is our country 🇺🇸.
Salute to President Trump ❤❤
Hand over your heart dumba**!!.
I’m not a fan of trumps antics but you can’t deny the crowd showed him love
At least was sung by trash who surfaced with no criminal record.. opps. Another trailer park trash Jo
Our President making America Patriotic Again ❤
Love it
The best president of the USA
I live for liberal tears. I been doing a lot of living.
THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT!! ❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤🇺🇲❤
Trump and Eagles a winner.
Democrats on suicide watch.
Americans are sick of the condescending celebrities, the media propaganda, and the political elite telling them how to live while they jet around the world and live in luxury. Taylor Swift has been shoved in our faces non-stop, propped up by the media and the political machine. Meanwhile, Trump represents a rebellion against that system, patriotism, freedom, and putting America first.  This wasn’t about misogyny or "intimidation by a powerful woman" , like the media is trying to portray it, it was about Americans saying "we are done putting up with the bs".
Nice!
Its trump fault KC lost 😂😂😂
Lots of liberal crying in these comments. Cry me a river.
I still have not stopped smiling since the election.
He looks like he's asleep to me.
Trump was cheered of course. Swift was booed of course. Trump keeps winning.
Trump 2025 ❤
America is back baby!
Biden would have given the Bozo salute.
A president for the American PEOPLE!! ❤️🙌
Trump is an American hero.
😂
Defeat DEI and wokeism!
A salute from a convicted felon - just saying...
Bonespurs left early because he was booed and started his  sundowning. Poor Ivanka now has to take extra care of her old man 😢
I thought he hated the nfl...all political bs
All Americans love this tremendous Brave Man!
Trump is big with the CTE crowd.
WHAT AN IMBECILE!!! WHo salutes during the national anthem, CLEAELY Cadet Bone Spurs was NEVER in the military!!!
DEPORT DEPORT DEPORT
America is back !!
He brought bad mojo to KC…it’s an omen of things to come.  He might not want invite the eagles to the WH so now they’ll miss out on delicious Mcdonalds
LIKE A BOSS🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸FEAR NOTHING! A TRUE AMERICAN HERO
Just look at the democratic party logo😅
Trump was cheered of course. Swift was booed of course. Trump keeps winning.
Sounds like they had a lot of Trump trash in the Superdome.
TRUMP is an ABSOLUTE TRUE PATRIOT 🇺🇲 Puts it on the line everyday for America ❤️💯 Thank YOU President Trump 🇺🇲
Trump is saving America one day at a time.
Taylor boooooo😅
Trump saluting is a joke.  He had his chance to salute when he was drafted but the coward bone spurred himself out instead.
Shame on them for not announcing the President of the United States was in attendance! No matter what president it was - that should have been done. But NFL has TDS, so they only gave a split second camera shot!
The crowd and the piano was louder than the singer; was kind of dull.
My president! MAGA / MAHA !!!
Come on man, that's a wimp version of  the United States National Anthem.  TRUMP 🇺🇸
and no one booed him   says alot usa....
This version of national anthem was almost as bad as Rosanne Barr's version.
Lol, Taylor Swift got booed while Trump got the cheers 😂😂😂
Uncle Trump looks great and America we look Beterrrrr!!!! KDot voice
0:18
Most Corrupt Politician ever Would you buy a used car from DJT
President Cheeto Jesus draft Dodger saluting with the money he stole from his Children's Cancer charity on his shoes
Democrats in shambles.
Trump was cheered of course. Swift was booed of course. Trump keeps winning.
That's my President!!
Only dnc cultists hate Trump.
Trump 🏆
The gayest version ever
🤮🤮🤮
Look at all the idiot Democrats in these comments. Trump is Commander in Chief of the military .. of course he can salute. Idiots!
Hey look. No one cared Trump was there. He was dissed. Totally dissed.
Trump is a hero!
Trump is going to work every week like he did his first two weeks for all 208 weeks of his Presidency. Take that Dems/Libs!
He couldve saluted when he dodged the draft those 20 times.
His non military. Wrong thing to do
Trump in 2028
They tried to strike him down and made him more powerful than you can possibly imagine....lol
I’m so happy to see this country turning a new leaf. I believe people of every race and orientation have come to the same conclusion.
Worst anthen, probably ever.
We’re SO WINNING!!!
Trump can do no wrong.
FDT, POS! THE SOONER HIS 4YRS IS UP, THE BETTER.
🫡
Nice to see Swifties take a Big L.
Funny how Trump did not make an entrance to the super bowl yet. The camera showed him saluting the flag during the national anthem and I don't know who this artist was from Louisiana or New Orleans. Honestly, he meant nothing to me. It was a lousy rendition of the national anthem to be quite Frank, but all the sudden you saw when they posted the camera on Trump saluting the flag that showed you everything you need to know about what people many people in this country think about the president.
Taylor Swift is a woke mess.
Taylor Swift got booed😂
WE ARE IN THE GOLDEN AGE!!
LOOKING FORWARD TO TRUMP'S THIRD TERM AFTER THIS ONE!!!
How is he even saluting and this  dried up MELON FELON never even served in the Armed Forces?!  Bone spurs BIOTCH!!
Louisiana loves President Trump.
Some military guy or girl should sing the national anthem at all super bowls. Tired of these artists putting their own spin on the national anthem.
I love this man from day 1! Greetings from Germany
Biden has blood on his hands from Afghanistan withdrawal.
The military did not respect Biden. The military is honored to have Trump as Commander in Chief.
Sickening.
How are his bone spurs?
This national anthem was traitorous.
The crowd disgusts Taylor Swift and goes nuts for DJT America is so back. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Democrats on suicide watch.
Democrats are in shambles.
I think Trump scared The Chiefs & the Swifties 😂 they played like their minds where not here🎉
🇺🇸♥️🤍💙
I bet if Beyonce was dropping like it's hot ..they would have kept cameras on her
Trump is a hero .. Democrats are a zero.
What a joke. This is a man who disparages veterans and real war heroes. You rubes are so easily manipulated with meaningless gestures and symbols.
Where is the entire anthem?
Get rid of the Dept of Education. Trump is saving America.
Just sing the song smh
TRUMP BABY ❤
Philly fans cheering Trump?  Get out of town lol  I highly doubt the Eagles will accept an invitation to the White House, but they should just because
don't forget they boo Trump
Philly fans boo Santa claus
Trump Ruined the superbowl and brings back luck
Beautiful, Mr. Batiste!
Why is that draft dodger saluting?!
Draft dodging p o c saluting;  revolting.
Private bone spurs saluting is just hilarious
What a weak effort at the national anthem
Worst half-time show EVER!
President Trump needed a little break from all that winning.
So proud of our president 😊
The saluting draft dodger weird
I wonder how many parents will be rooting for Trump when the Dept of Education is dismantled and they can pay for their kids private education at about 20K a year
Ivanka looking great as always.
Salutes the flag and anthem of the country he has repeatedly bragged about evading paying taxes to and whose many laws he’s broken- wow; some “patriot”.
I like this rendition of the anthem. the regular is objectively boring melody
😂😂😂what a clown
This Marine saluting President Trump , America and its People 🇺🇸
The music for this SB was atrocious, worst I can remember for a SB
That was much better with Chris Stapleton.
How those egg prices doing? Oh wait, who cares right? This is way more important.
Will trump is attending the big game Elan is ripping off the treasury Social Security an American data biggest heist in the century
Hey : where's Mel ? 😂😂😂😂
Cheers for Trump .. Jeers for Swift!
to all you dipsh!ts....  they were cheering the flag  they were booing your wannabe dictator  and even if youre right  youre still unemployable losers 💀💀💀
America is back
Mixed reactions lol
How dare a draft-dodger salute, Im not a democrat but its dishonoring us all as warriors
Mr general trump
Our Great President!
Notice how the crowd roared lefty’s?
You realize all of this comes from tax dollars right? Can’t he just watch on TV? Or better yet work on lowering grocery prices?
TRAITOR IN CHIEF
sky is blue
Not like us was a perfect song for Trump. Luckily for him, his favorite eye candy is next to him.
here we go witth the news stations lowering the cheers in the audio
Trump is a man of the people!
Let's see what he destroys this week. He is a disgrace.😢
❤❤❤
Jesus protect our President. Thank You for not leaving us. Please help California. You know our voice has been stolen. The very small Hollywood has stolen our voice. Don’t leave us in Jesus’ name we pray.
Our Constitutional government has been sold out to Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 ideologues and complicit Elon Musk bank rolled Republican lawmakers. Donald Trump is too bereft to have a policy agenda of his own that would benefit America rather than destroying it.
Look at that draft dodger sucker👺🥊🇳🇱🇻🇳47 Kim needs a love letter you traitor. Impeachment before red wave👑💩
Terrible game.  A game like this never would have occurred if Biden was still in office.
Respect for our President.  🙏🏼🙌🏼❤️🇺🇸
Todos admiran a Trump excepto los comunistas parasitos, falsos y asquerosos
He's such an idiot.
Everyone loves Trump. Dont listen to anything the corrupt, communist, traiterous left wing media says
This doesnt bring my grocery or gas proces down. Thanks trump.
❤😊
The Star of the game 🎯  my president DONALD TRUMP 🎉❤
He's a joke nobody wants to see his face.
🤮
Who is this singer??  Ugh. 😑
According to the New York Post everyone “cheered” for him. lol   Vladimir is happy.
Eminence Front,  It’s a put on.
Best president ever
he should do elon salute instead
I noticed the grand high exalted mystic twice impeached twice elected felon/wannabe rulers presence wasn't announced. I wonder why.
Trump got a Stone Cold crowd pop they tried to bury it. 😂
As Owen Meany would have said, made for television.
Does this lower egg prices?
Lol of course he does.
Anybody cheering for Trump then were silent for the army cadets are apart of the problem.
You gotta love this man
THE CROWD LOVES TRUMP AND THE CROWD HATES TAYLOR...... PERIOD
That’s my President! F the libs!
Where Melania?
No more kneeling during the national anthem...🤣😅😂😂
I loved this version of the national anthem he did great
HE IS A FELON !!! CONVICTED FELON
Trump, Trump, its Trump!!!
🇺🇸 🇺🇸 AMERICA FIRST 🇺🇲 TRUMP/VANCE 🇺🇸  ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I am a Mexican-American taxpayer citizen, my whole family,  friends... literally everyone, we are America First 🇺🇸 🇺🇸   Democrats are straight up liars, hypocrites,  HATEFUL,  RACISTS and DIVISIVE AF.
🤮
Thank you Trump for saving our country ❤❤❤❤❤
The media and Dems tried so hard to demonize him, but the people love him.  The people's president, despised by the corrupt centers of power, loved by the people!
beautiful job, Jon Batiste ❤️
And the chiefs like most Indians packed it up and ran when times got tough, Mahomes will never win when Brady is in the house!!!!
❤❤TRUMP LOVES AMERICANS
This shows what Americans wants
THAT'S ARE President!! We the people!  🇺🇸🇺🇸💯
singer sux
Dude this guy dodged the draft and disrespected soldiers on television, he does not care about veterans
Anyone else that gets that “pop” they keep cameras on for much longer. 😂
No cover....hand over heart....what a clueless loser
Fans Love Trump 💪
😂 what an idiot
Jon Batiste for president.  The other guy is soft.
Trump was an absolute JINX for the Chiefs!!! 🤬🤬🤬
No one cares what First Lady Trump does
With tax payers on the hook
Horrible music!  Worse than last year!
This man truly loves this country, it nearly brings tears to my eyes" 🫡
Boo. Hope he doesn't accidentally slip or anything. That would be amazing....I mean terrible.
Can’t wait to see how the view spins this.
Crowd erupts in cheers seeing our president ♥️
What an imbecile
Best President ever!! 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Trump 💪🏻
Love Trump
What an awful rendition...
People when Biden checks watch during the funeral of the 13 americas he left behind to die: WHAT A GREAT PRESIDENT!!  People when Trump salutes during the nation anthem: WHAT A RACIST HOMOPHOBE!!
Trump is a disgusting pig
Awesome the American people love Trump!
CULT OF PERSONALITY!!!!
POTUS ❤🫡🇺🇸
Trump got cheers! Taylor got jeers!  Eagles win! Lol!
ICE should be at the game! Checking citizenships and making arrests!
It feels kinda weird hearing the American National Anthem sang differently every time. In our country even the tune and speed must be precise, no one can sing it in their "style"
Doesn’t change the fact that he’s destroying this country. He’s the biggest hypocrite who DOES NOT care about this country. He does things like this all for show.
A salute. I’ve got a salute for him.
What a filthy pigeon this mutt is.. I bet Ivanka game daddy a handy the whole game....
Like he really wanted to.
As Highly as we hold the President, he is a servant of the people. Saluting to the flag - the symbol of the people - is so powerful.
That’s my President 🇺🇸
PR stunt
Love the full on cheer for Trump!!!!
DEI hire for national anthem
Boooobooobooo
A President who loves our Country.  How nice
You can't deny that the people, majority of the people, are happy that Trump is back. You stay thinking negative, your mind will never be at peace. Meanwhile, the Lord is working through Donald J Trump.
Yeah, the idiot showed him for what one point five seconds.With this show, taylor swift and everyone else for longer and multiple times
What a leader 💯
Bunch of swamp folks
As a veteran, to those saying he shouldn't salute, I feel it's absolutely appropriate for him to do so. He is the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces.
Trump fired the board members of the Kennedy Center  yesterday.  Jon Batiste was a board member.
Crass orange buffoon. What an insult to US military by saluting. Captain bone spurs has no right.
Most hated and pathetically president. Despicable old man.
THE LEADER 🇺🇸MAGA
Shouldn't he be in Jail?
F#$% trumpy the traitor.
Okay so why is there only so many putting there hands over there hearts or saluting or why the players not putting there hands on their hearts. I'm 44 and I have noticed that people have forgotten about what that represents.  We the people right?
President Trump shouldn’t have graced the NFL with his presence.
That's my Commander and Chief! Make America great again!
Noticed how Trump stayed awake?
When Trump came on screen the CHEERS WERE LOUD AND AMAZING but camera had to move on … sad
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Not the salute i thought hed do
The crowd cheered for our President Donald Trump and booed Taylor Swift.  How appropriate.
I’m surprised it wasn’t a different salute
CHIEFS DOOMED TO FAIL!!! TRUMP picks Chiefs to WIN !
Despicable excuse for a human being
Hermoso
People cheering for fascism and authoritarianism.  Wow.  America sure is no longer the country it once was.
Trump greatest president 👏 🙌🏾
Presidents aren’t supposed to salute during the national anthem. Ask Dwight Eisenhower!
Still working, that kind of  💩?
The people just love him!!
Wheres the Mrs must not be on the list
As he stood  there saluting,  he realized  trying to get away from DEI is impossible even for  the most powerful man in the world . Ahh if only this was a UFC event . Secret Service GET me out of here .
We’re back and now the world knows we are back…never been prouder! Now let’s clean the house.
Bone spurs saluted..lol funny guy..
Piece of dung.
Funny Fox didn’t air the national anthem!?!?!
Man that singer was terrible
The Felon in Chief!
Draft dodger doesn't know the meaning of a salute.
Thats what real patriots do. I stopped watching nfl when players took knees during anthem and the woke push agenda
This guy , whoever he is, ruined the National Anthem.  Why can't people just sing it as it was meant to be?
The crowd cheer for our president! You can’t hide that as Americans we feel proud ❤ 🇺🇸
This clip was way more entertaining than the lousy half time show.
He’s an insult to our country.
As Commander in Chief he has EVERY right to salute the flag! Thank you Mister President, you're doing a GREAT job!
it is not a salute... what a dishonor and disgrace'... military salute is a privilege for those who have served in the armed forces' ... civilians are not expected to salute the American flag during the national anthem. Instead, they should stand at attention and place their right hand over their heart. '
I thought you weren't supposed to salute??
Why would liberals be mad when we can laugh at him everyday? 😂
USA! USA! Legal Latinos for Trump.. 🇺🇲😎💪🏻
Chills
Somewhere Biden is watching this from a recliner in an old folks home.
Idiot doesn’t know you pledge allegiance to the flag and salute the soldier!
~🦾🪙🪙💡⚡️⚡️🪙💡💰🦾
Libtards will say he was booed
A British prime minister has saluted his country’s national anthem since Winston Churchill, our last patriotic leader,since then the country’s political leaders have been bending and begging to be allowed into the European
First convicted felon president attends Super Bowl! First insurrectionist-in-chief to attend! What a disgrace.
Just sing it as intended.  Beautiful voice, but just sing the Anthem.
That national anthem was a disgrace.
TURN HIS TV OFF! TURN HIS TV OFF 📺🍊
The land of the free . Right
What a nose
Will Ivanka be sitting on his lap as she normally does?
Anybody who says the SB is rigged for KC to win, what can you say now?
What an embarrassment
The crowd went wild and the producer said move
Yesssss!!! mf Amerika!!!
Sorry Taylor you’re not the star of the show today!
He is gonna destroy the world we all know it
Yay, President Trump!
Phony President!
Its amazing that no main stream media will admit Trump got a great applause except Fox news. That should tell you the corruption of the media. No wonder they dont want Elon looking at the books!
You're supposed to put your hand over your heart. Only those who served in the military are supposed to salute.
THE CONVICTED FELON TRUMP! Yes, that is exactly what he is, lol!
Commander in Chief!!! Respect for our country on display
True Leader 🙏🏼
Did melania not attend?
Wow wow 🇺🇸🙏🏻🇺🇸🙏🏻🇺🇸🙏🏻
That's our commander and chief
Amazing performer and of course President Trump as a true Commander in Chief. 👏🏾👏🏼👏🏽🇺🇸
A traitor  and a draft dodger saluting ? What a joke!😂😂😂😂😂
Oh look he's with his wife Ivanka
Here we go ...Trump show up for photo op hah hah
If the clown Biden were there he’d have an ice cream cone in one hand and the Chinese dictator on the phone in his other hand , asking for more money for favors
❤ !!!!!!  ❤
JEEZ, Don! Thats NO way to earn The Lefts vote!!!
Ivanka still looking fine even after all these years and kids 😍
LOVE YOU DADDY TRUMP ❤️
Nothing to see here folks Plus Trump needs to give black people their 40 acres and a mule
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
FDT, totalitarian traitor.
TrumpMAGA❣️🇺🇲🦅💋  🏈Go Birds🦅🏈
WHAT AN *SSH*LE.  The president doesn't salute the flag.  Hand goes over the heart.  If he had one .
WOW I GUESS DONALD TRUMP REALLY LOVES HIS COUNTRY ❤❤
They didn't show the audio on Fox News I wonder why because a lot of people will probably booing him wow
Why is this idiot waring a suit to a football hame??
Who's that butchering our National Anthem? 🤮
Disgusting old man
Only reason I watched the super bowl
I hope someone doesn't sheeet him
You can't hide the fact that the crowd cheered for Trump.
I’ve never been a fan of people who haven’t served, using a hand salute.  You’d think somebody in his staff would have taught him a proper salute.
Get down w DJT!!!
This is MAGA country.
Trump is disgusting
MY PRESIDENT!!!!!
That anthem was horrible. Whitney Houston has nothing to worry about. Her version is still tops by miles.
Trump shouldn't be saluting at all. The president is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, but not a MEMBER of the armed forces.  Saluting is a privilege reserved to members of the military, and in the case of the national anthem at least, veterans.  Trump is neither, as has been the case with most presidents in recent years.  As a veteran, I've always found the practice of presidents saluting, particularly those who have never worn the uniform, to be quite disturbing.
Cool. The draft dodger saluting during the anthem...
How dare him!!!
I just know he was jamming when Kdot came out!
America is coming back from the woke dei apocalypse feeling proud again! Thank you President Trump.
All hail the criminal
Cameras will edit something wrong with his presence at superbowl I’m sure 😂
Nobody kneeled on that field today. I wonder why :3
Idiot
He dodged the draft. Stuff your fake salute.
They super blacking the super bowl now. I personally liked Stapleton's rendition years ago. Amazing.
I wonder how it must feel to have gotten a doctor to diagnose you for bone spurs to dodge the draft during the Vietnam War and then find yourself giving a military salute when you’re 78?
Worst halftime show I've ever seen..AWFUL
So nice to see a strong Alpha male president. Unlike the limp wristed cadaver of the last regime
AMERICA 🇺🇸
People he came to enjoy a football game so just stop complaining about his way of saluting
This is the best part of the superbowel.
Sing the anthem right!
President trump! ❤️🇺🇸🦅❤️🇺🇸🦅❤️🇺🇸🦅  BEAUTIFULLY SANG! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The Comander and Chief 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Dementia Donald always trying to get in the news.
Wasn’t that a woke version of the anthem???
Trump!!
It’s so nice to have a real President again
piped in fake crowd noise for trump
Liberal Media headlines will be, "He didn't know how to salute." 😂
Before anyone complains the U.S president (Trump or no Trump) is allowed to salute without prior military service since they now hold the position of commander and chief of the military.
FDT
Winning!
I bet Trump doesn’t even know the words for the National Anthem
10000000 Aura Gained
Trump ✊🏼🇺🇸
A traitor to this country. A convicted felon. Elected to the highest office of the United States. Saluting our flag.  What a disgrace!
Melania is happy to have another day without the obese combover liar!
The crowd roars for Trump but those head woke NFL big shots are still letting trans or freaks perform the anthem
I guess it can be hard sticking to the tune when you have a tarantula on your head to worry about whether he's going to bite you or not
This idiot is going to put tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum.
Hand over heart...unless your military.
Funny how trump stooges soil themselves over alleged 60 minutes editing Kamala's interview but lap up this edited video where the boos for Trump were replaced with cheers. 🤣
Nice to see our president!!!!
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Halftime spectacle, PLEASE lets get back to basics, some real music that people can sing along with!!!!!!!!!!
I’m no prognosticator, but watching the halftime show I’m pretty sure we know who’s going to win country album of the year in 26!!!
<3
Trump ie the Man
Draft dodging coward knows how too salute, great job Benedict.
I thought he said the NFL is over.
Patriots on a roll, swiftly winning this one! 😊 😅 😊
The cheers for Trump was wild. ❤
A non-soldier garbage bag full of lies, corruption, cowardice, treason, global embarrassment, and cringe. What a creep.   Hugs, from 🇨🇦
Love it!!
Scuffed rendition wow
Doing what the commander and chief is supposed to do!
Acting like a king because he can’t govern like a president.
Who is he saluting he never served. 🤡
He’s the real MVP in my opinion  Edit: of course in my definition, it would mean most valuable president not to mention he’s the goat as well
The idiot president drumph salutes that's a laugh
We are so back.
Gee what an accomplishment
Trump is the greatest leader in the history of this nation.
Look at this disgusting Dictator! His right goes over his heart as a civilian. He was never a soldier, he coward out!
They thought he would be booed 😂😂😂
Who came here to see TRUMP?
Idiot
🫏
Its a football game full of american men and i dont even like or watch football but come on did u really think he would be booed here or at ufc lol so satisfying to hear him cheered because the left is so loud about their distain
So sick of them ruining the anthem sing it normally and that’s it!!!!!
The past 3 weeks have been incredible. Thank you Sir!
Delusional leftists were planning on having an impact by boycotting watching the Super Bowl this year 😂
They were cheering the Cadets.
Wait  didn’t maga folks had quit nfl
The Chiefs are losing because of Tom Brady's play calling.
Daddy Trump❤❤❤❤❤

Turned off halftime show..you call that trash music ?????????
Real commander in chief
Who cares ………
Trump: Eating ice cream   Everybody: Trump caught eating ice cream in the beach
He looks like an idiot….oh wait he is an idiot
Terrible rendition. The NFL is such a joke
Canada 51st state
Now that’s a leader. Biden would have been wandering around looking for ice cream calling out to every black guy he saw “ hey, cornpop, it’s me, chicken Joe Biden!”
I actually got emotional when I saw this especially when the crowd cheered. My heart swelled. America is back baby. I can’t describe the feeling of having an actual leader.
Aaaand the crowd goes nuts!!!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That's a POTUS, ladies and gentlemen.   THAT is how it’s done!
Wow, trump, stop funds programs for kids around the world, but we have to pay for his trip to the Super Bowl
Hail the Commander in Chief!
Hope Kelce loses!
The amount of support that President Trump has in unbelievable. He’s got far more support than the 51% of the country that the media portrays.
❤️🦅🇺🇸❤️🦅🇺🇸
He is the Commander in Chief❤
Wow the crowd really cheered for president Trump
Convicted felon
Absolutely the greatest president this country has ever had in its entire history.   I predict he will undoubtedly win the Nobel peace prize.  🇺🇸
Excellent singing!❤🇺🇸
Maga's going to find out how expensive ignorance is
But Elon is the president
STRENGTH. President Donald J Trump.
Too bad the woke producers only stayed on him for 1 second.
Wheres the first lady muskrat
Boo to trump 📣🔊🗣️
America is back ❤.
GOAT!
I’m so glad that we have a president again.
Wow a lot cheers when they show president trump ❤❤❤❤ Yeah 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 That’s my president
Trump predicts the Chiefs will win.  ROTFLMAO  "When a quarterback wins as much as Mahomes has, I have to go with Kansas City.''
Please tell me they booed him or at least said "FDT"
Same guy who wanted everyone to boycott the NFL so many years ago.😂
That's our president!
I didn’t see president elect Elon musk?
Military Trump.
True American. Unlike the Un American Traitor Dermocraps.
Beautiful ☝️ ❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Can’t believe the nursing home is letting trump out for a day!!
Trump turning the USA into a white supremacist nation MAGA 🇺🇸 and it's working perfectly 👍🏻
A true American
Thank you, president! It’s time for a big audit
Someone please teach this man how to salute!!! I get it he wants to salute. Fine. As a 25 year military veteran I HATE to see a sloppy salute like that from the Commander in Chief!!!
Try matching his charisma.
Eagle 🦅 fans thank Trump for jinxing the game for the chiefs
America is back bro DJT🇺🇸🥲💪🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
There goes President Cheeto being considerate of our tax dollars and being the first President to show up at a Super Bowl.  Love the focus on the wasteful spending and doing his part.
Live there were no boooos !!! Shame on NYP
And yet, the players were kneeling during the playing of the National Anthem!
Another butchering of the National Anthem.   Sung like a love song.  SMH.
He saluted?! What a POS!!
Trump wastes taxpayer money to be there.  Make him pay for his own security.  This adds to the debt of New Orleans. Extra police. He should be sent the bill.
What a draft dodging poser saluting like he was a soldier. Bone spurs aren't effecting him now.😂😂😂😂
❤
Not agreeing with all who say the National Anthem was great. It was horrible, imo.
👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
He should not be saluting. He was never in the military!
WHO EVER SANG THIS DISERVSE A GRAMMY
Draft dodger
Love president DJ Trump🙏🏻🇺🇸❤️👏🏻🥰
Finally a real commander and chief
Oh please . Draft dodger and convicted felon. Whole world 🌎 is laughing and so they should 😅😅
ppl cheering Trump
The Commander in Chief may render the hand salute either  covered or uncovered.
Bring back Chris Stapleton
What a horrible rendition
Wow! all the cheering! nice!
FDJ6T
Total awesome
That's my President!!!!!!!
Just put your hand over your heart. That’s salute is horrid.
Donald Trump is so disgusting
Best. President. Ever.
🇺🇸🥳 wish y'all the best
Song was almost unrecognizable.
I AM THAT I AM! I AM  ME MYSELF N I DO NOT IDENTIFY AS A COLOR👈 MY SKIN IS 7 LAYERS N HOUSES MY MY HEART, WISOM N INTELLIGENCE HONOR N  RESPECT TO OWN MY PERSONALITY  ATTITUDE TRAITS N SELF RESPECT! WE BLEED RED ALL OF MANKIND! I AM AN AMERICAN FIRST BORN BELOVED FOREVER!❤🖤🤎🤍👍🏿👌🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
I love how he got an ovation from the crowd when they showed him.  I love President Trump!
No melania at 2025 Superbowl with donald.  Most likely donald refused her price to attend.  What's love got to do with it.
That's my President!!
Notice how people booed Dumpster Trump. 😂😂😂
The dems are melting
This Orange buffoon should use the salute of Russia since that’s who he works for!  THE most incompetent and corrupt president in history!
LET’S GO! HOOAH!
Trump is awesome
Trump is so Boss Level.
Who is the wokester singing. What a fruitcake. They should have gotten someone based.
We love Trump❤
Roaring applause for our commander and chief! MURICA IS BACK !!
Trump's the Greatest
The Felon has arrived and the cult is excited. He’s doing a great job of crashing our economy so far.
Nothing but Trump dickriders in this comment section
His so fake
Hail trump 😂
Edited it he was booed
MAGA reigns supreme 🇺🇲
A president that isn't sleeping or trying to shake hands with the air.
The boss
I love you trump
this is great for our country and the players, shows a stronger America to our enemies and gives the sport more viewership
The Greatest President of my lifetime!,Donald J Trump!🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸 with a respectful nod to Ronald Regan
Happy Gulf of America day everyone 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Salute these nuts, Trump.
Yes everyone cheering. Thank you president Trump. Jesus Christ please protect Donald Trump and his family and team.
"Zesty" ah salute
One of the worst national anthem performances.
Saddest song he has ever sung.
I heard trump was a draft dodger just sayin.
So nice to see President Trump is back!
He looks so old!
did they do the BS black anthem too?
Notice nobody took a knee?
Food, EGGS! Gas Prices higher then last year. NO EXCUSES Trump reportedly got booed hard by the crowd at Caesars Superdome on Sunday night. "Trump just got booed big time. And I'm loving it," one fan reported from the stadium. "The whole bar just booed Trump when he came on screen," one fan added. "A lot of people booed trump when he showed up at the game…" one fan added. It sounds like other watch parties are booing Trump's arrival, too. "Just booed Trump at the sports bar," one fan added.
National Anthem was spectacular!  Beautifully done! ❤. Also loved fans reaction to see President Trump & Military during national anthem, American pride and patriotism is back baby!!
LFG!!!!!!!
Trump is an American hero. I am forever grateful.
Everyone should take hats off and salute 🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏💚
45/47🇺🇸
❤Doje clean House.  Yaay USA
First president to waste an obsene amount of money to attend.  Can you say scumbaaaaaaag?
❤‼️🫂🇺🇸✌️
NEW YORKS HOMETOWN BOY.....TRUMP
GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER MAGA
I dont do Football but I will watch because of President Trump! 🎉
Trump went to see Taylors face after philly wins
The Commander in Chief is who they roared for. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Beautiful music and President
THANKS TRRRRUMP ! 💯💯💯👍‼️🇺🇲LET'S GOOOOO !
Don’t you see my Lol emoji, I was being facetious. Supered he knew…lol😂😂😅
Booed everytime they show his hateful weird mishappened @55. The entire world and the majority of this country hates you illiterate fake tough guy weirdos
PATHETIC SINGER
That blew!!
Sing the song RIGhT! It’s not a nightclub talent show! People have died for what that song represents you heartless idiot!
SB got a different vibe this year. MAGA 2025
The fact Trump will be at the same game as someone as thoughtful as Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is playing in, is a remarkable contradiction. This week, Hurts spoke about the evolution of the Black quarterback, and how he doesn't take this moment lightly, where two Black quarterbacks are again playing in the Super Bowl. It's the kind of thoughtfulness we've come to expect from him; that kind of depth Trump doesn't possess. Trump is believed to be the first sitting president to possibly attend the Super Bowl. There's a reason sitting presidents don't normally go. It's potentially a security nightmare. But also, to me, they want the game to be the center of attention, not them. Trump wants to go to get attention but also to show dominance over a league that once rejected him. He holds grudges the way Tom Brady holds Super Bowl records. It doesn't matter that Trump is a huge sports fan or has attended Super Bowls before. Who cares. What matters is now. Now, Trump stands for the opposite of everything we love about the Super Bowl.
He probably paid those people to cheer him.
What a hypocrite, he NEVER served in the Military, and talks trash about service members all the time!!!
Two thumbs down on the singer.  Was there some tragedy or something and the singer they had scheduled got sick or kidnapped?
If you’re a traitor, draft dodger, you do not have the right to salute.
Our President❤❤❤
There is only one National Anthem for all the people of the United States PERIOD !!!!!!!!!!!
He got a better ovation than the singer. Rightfully so. Sing it like it was wrotten
Oh yeah cnn his approval rating is low
No one is kneeling. The USA is healing.
Make America proud again 💯
The Boss is back :15 ❤
Lovely voice.
The new sheriff is cleaning up the mess
The Only reason to watch this dumb game!
Ray Charles was better
Where's Melania
That ain't no anthem
CAN SOMEONE STOP THIS CLOWN SINGING 🤡 🙄 😒
Loud cheer !!!
America the beautiful... President Trump & family.  😍🥰😘
I thought it was well done and respectful
He is correct to salute since that Presidential lapel pin is his uniform and he is the Commander in Chief. No different than saluting his Marines when he boards aircraft.
Private Bone Spurs…kinda got that Gomer Pyle vibe going on
I LOVE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP!!!
hahahahaha Who voted for him, just sayin.
And why on earth, New York Post, dould we not see a whole clip!
I will never forget 2019-2024. It’s been action park level of a rollercoaster these past several years. From Covid and toilet paper shortages, to riots and looting. From trans rights and racism=bad, to the alphabet mafia and being racist to the white man
YA ALL CLOWNS
Bone Spurs saluting Putin
Crowd cheering for a REAL LEADER...President Trump! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
House Democrats and the family of Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer killed in the Jan. 6 riots, hold a press conference............... They were protecting died protecting our country... Now we have a felon as a president..............
( So many patriots cant even tell you why a prez didn’t even swear an oath and rocks the wartime flag in his office?)
I would have expected louder cheers from the whole stadium. How odd.
Thats our PRESIDENT salute 🫡
Joyless Reid Will be melting down 😆😆
We have a real president again, not a deep state puppet!
Nice America is back LFG
GO EAGLES
Ol ‘ Bone Spurs draft Dodger coward
I don't care what that idiot does.
I like singers who don't feel the need to put their personal "style" on the Anthem.
That's hilarious to see the Zionist pos saluting. What a joker.
Notice Trump isn't checking his watch to see what time it is?
I love Jon Batiste, and he did not disappoint! Fabulous! He seems like such a nice person!
What a fan POTUS!
F trump , he’s the opposite of what the USA stand for
🇺🇸🫡
This might be the greatest Gulf of America Day ever!
So many evil people in this comment section. Sad to see that this is the new norm.
A joke 😭😭😭
Definitely not a campaign add clip for the Democrat party . Just wish Maxine could have made it on the jumbo-tron for a reaction.
He’s never been a veteran. Why does he salute.
Think Rosanne  and Tom Arnold  did a better  nation anthem.😮😮😢
Thank you America for electing president Trump; your votes are resulting in commonsense change all over the world, even downunder in my country
A crowd cheering for their president, what a breath of fresh air. AMERICA IS BACK!
I loved  the cheering. Finally a president that is respected!!
🇺🇸♥️🙏🏾
They act shocked that he's patriotic.
Channeling his Inner Marvin Gaye
Stop winning Mr president it's starting to get boring 🤣😉
Crowd cheers when the saw Trump Thought everyone on the internet said he would get booed haha yep yall were wrong
Liberals: "All that attended the superbowl LIX in New Orleans are racist".... LOL
Trump will do anything for a photo op. He only came to the super bowl to get is attention that he craves.
Man he gave the anthem some soul
Luigi where are you ??
Commander in Chief...
Shame
Why the gaye pianist? 🤦🏾
So diselegant and unpatriotic of NYP to interrupt the anthem in the middle.
Why did Trump go to the anti-American superbowl. Guess I am one of the few that has not watched a game since 2016.
Trump the Zionist
horrible version of our national anthem
Trump 👍
Liberals despise the country that raised them
❤❤❤
Trump is a traitor!
It was an awful rendition of the National Anthem. And there is only one national anthem. Pretending there are two anthems is intentionally divisive
Not happy I’m paying for Felon 47 to watch a Super Bowl game.  Just saying.  How about paying attention to bringing down grocery prices and end war in Ukraine before Monday rolls around.
Her loyalty is to Isreal sorry not buying that arm over heart BS...
🫡
🍊🤡🎪
We all love Trump!
thank you in advance for your service, cadets.  Those are the real badasses right there. 🇺🇸
I  heard cheers ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Crowd goes wild❤
Notice the cheers when he was shown.
Your taxes $ hard at work ..
I see he paid attention (or somebody did) the last time a bunch of us pointed out that civilians are expected to stand at attention and place our hands over our hearts in honor of our flag.
And he got cheered. That's not gonna get talked about lol
THAT'S MY PRESIDENT !!!!!!
That’s a double
Beautiful from President Trump to the song.
He has no clue where he is at 😂
Hail to the Chief, long live MAGA.
One of the very few people that was. P.     H.    U.   C.    The.    N.      F.      L
And there's the proof! The loud cheering when camera showed President Trump
While a real president is at the super bowl Joe Biden having a diaper change at Carl's jr
Did Trump not know he doesn’t salute? 😂😂😂😂
So sick of this clown
Do presidents usually salute during the national anthem?
A hole
Only people in uniform should be saluting
Great to feel the power of America is back!!!!  MAGA 🇺🇸
❤crowd goes wild for the GOAT TRUMP, smack in the middle of the National Anthem 😂
Boos Yay! Take that dictator YOU ARE HATED!
Non military person saluting is very odd, but then a lot of things about that man are very odd.
Thank Allah Hamas supporters aren’t invited screaming Free Palestine at the Super Bowl…
Who was cheering? It sounded loud and got quiet real quick
Notice the lack of FJB chants. 😁😁😁 So glad to be BACK to a real President!!!
Yall remember they tried making a black national anthem 😂😂😂
USA USA
Well, he IS Commander in Chief 🤷 That was one of the worst renditions I've ever heard! President Trump was probably wishing it was Carrie Underwood or something
I heard loud cheers from the crowd when they showed Trump… just saying!
Veterans are suckers and losers according to Don the Con.
Reality: saluting technocrats
You only salute if  you are  or have been part of the military. Civilians hold hand over heart.
Eww that singer. Who is that
The hate from the left in the media and comment sections is hilarious....they have nothing better to do than continue feigning fake outrage over everything.....oh well.
Commander in Chief.  Not trying to send every penny to foreign wars. Defending US Territory. Biden / Harris / Pelosi fading already into a bad dream.
Very nice.   🇺🇲
Love TRUMP, LOVE ALL AMERICANS,   LOVE AMERICA!!!  TRUMP BRINGING US BACK TOGETHER
He has got some nerve saluting our flag.
Oh boy the lefties will have a hay day with this
Boss!
