Are snake bite kits work in USA with Rattlesnake
Graham,love your work,!!
What brand and model is the gimble that the Action 5 camera is mounted on?
Tandanus catfish might be the little natives you were catching i think
6 minutes in and I'm hooked. The bats! Haha.
Old loves too big for pants like that
Graham is ❤
I love Liz and Tommy
Secrets to freshwater fishing 🤔🤔🤔? First....the bait is best when it looks, smells, tastes, and moves like what's normally on it's menu. Second if you can see them they can see you. Third don't use soap 🧼 when you wash your hands, weird smells sticking to the bait repels the fish. Lastly never let shawn watch your lines or your beer. 😆🍻✌️
They just shaving a bit off the top of the hill to make the contracted grade by the numbers given to the workers I reckon .
Can't get enough of Off-grid series. Keep it up! Sending love from Canada 🇨🇦
It is an eel tailed catfish.
I served beer from a tap when I was about 7 years old
Awesome video as always Graham, Tommy and Liv. And the rest of the 4WD 24/7 crew. Off Grid is the absolute best show on YouTube. Thanks for letting us ride along with y’all on y’all’s adventures.
The best 4x4 drive by far it's not about egoes but seeing the country by everyday Aussies or non Aussies . 100% love this show do not change the contents please  and a very big thnak you😊
Who destroys perfectly good eggs by adding pickles to them, 👎... 👍👍 for the show though.
those are eel tailed catfish, the best way to catch yellowbelly is live freshwater shrimp or yabbies on a paternoster rig.
It's so frustrating you watch one episode and then have to search for the next episode. Why can't they just be in order
Australian lung fish.
Nah mate! 2 dudes with Handtools did that 6:48 in 3 years?
When fishing in the river like that, you need a bobber that way your line is not sitting on the bottom for the catfish❤
Put a deposit down on Maverick Caravans... circumstance changed could no longer finance the rest and they will not refund the deposit made. DOG OF A COMPANY
by cutting through rock, they can create a more level road with less steep grades, while also utilizing the excavated rock as fill material for other parts of the road construction, minimizing the need to transport additional materials from elsewhere.
So where’s Part2?? 🤪🤦‍♂️🤷
Cant wait to see new co host in bikini 😂and old mate with mullet looks like a stooge 😂love it they are going to make this channel worth it graham is a has been ....😅
How come you didn't give the cameraman a beer?
oh some grated sharp chedder on those eggs ! oooooo love it
It's a Rendahl's catfish (porochilus rendahli) also called an eel-tailed catfish
Billy hunt! Haven't heard that one in yonkers lol
We all think graham been doing it all to easily lately. It's time to go back to the  beginning of his roots time to bring out shorty and do a tour again how he started from the beginning. On how it all started without the luxury of caravans
Tom and Liv are great! Can’t wait to see more of them on 4wd 24/7…. I mean Off Grid 😂🤣👍🏻 😁😁😁.
They were Eel tail catfish
M glod ya all mike eat along da y 😂😂
Haven't watched one of these videos in a while into the fact that the channel is still just above 1 million subscribers is crazy to me, should be way higher
Probably not the best idea to do that water crossing at coonarr beach. Better off coming onto the beach at coonarr, not Woodgate.
Where's ya yabby net Knackers
Where is that Highway
Love seeing that Y62 & F250 together. When it comes to pulling campers and off-roading. Those are the right ones for this show. I like the new cast as well, they bring a lot of personality.
That gorge looks like Iceland touching Australia
Nitto Trail Grappler MT 35x12.50r18 are rated at 890mm or many 295/65r20 and some 285/75r18 for OEM wheels.
Please get the old gang back together soon. It’s just not the same
Tom and liv are an awesome asset to the show. Down to earth humble people.
Pro tip dont boil eggs covered in water. Steam them. have about 1cm of water in the bottom of the pot and thats it.
Love your work… you keep it real and things like this happen Well handled re Toyota, as it certainly was a warranty issue  Looking forward to your Tassie content
You went to Carnarvon Gorge and didn't go in, was it because you couldn't drive up to everything and get out to take a photo?
Whens the 2nd half of this airing?
Eel tail catfish graham. Bout as worthless as carp
Ahhhh so this is the video that the clip was from!
I LOVE your series.......... sooo look forward to each vid.  THANK YOU mate for taking us along with you....
Best on youtube atm
Amazing meals at stonehenge  pub
😮 If this was real life id love to be able to just pull up anywhere to camp like that.
Quite a draught thru the tunnel.
Big f truck and no uhf??? Cmon guys lol Great watch
They cut through the hills to create flash flood controls. The flash foods were common so the ideas was to protect livestock and invest in reservoirs therefore the water flow needed to be changed. They look like roads now but not 150 years ago.
I like the cooking segments. Utterly useless but very charming.
How about treating the young lady before blabbing about the first aid set up. You're not American 😅
Hi there I’m a 28 year old male who has had the worst 1.5 years of my life. Broken spine which ruined my dream of being a. Carpenter, hit with ridiculous lawyers fees, car was written off by someone else as I could not afford full insurance and now recently lost the love of my life. Any help would be much appreciated  Thankyou
If you wanna catch a big freshwater cod use cheese
@4WD247 Would love to see the literary of the trip ??
NO! NO! NO GARLIC OR SPRING ONIONS WITH EGGS EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW NO!!! 😂 🤣🎉🇳🇿
I like the couple better😢
I live the fact you got the chick from trailer park boys on your channel
If you find yourself back out near bundy. Should also check cania gorge and kroombit tops
Fun to see you in my backyard i live in mt Perry, also never seen that many buts in that tunnel
Good to see Kinkuna getting some recognition! Bundy local is very happy right now. 🎉
Glade Graham got new off siders first offgrid i have watched in a long time carnt stand the other tagalongs
Liv and Tommy be careful.  S😂ems graham has the ability to create a +1 for the team traveling with him.
Please come to malaysia… the was alot adventure trail here.. you got to option.. Borneo or peninsular
Why do they buy that American shit
I've been to Australia twice and the weather is polar opposite November to February is our cold season in Alabama anyway.  I love it down under
Bloody awesome, that’s adventure!! Don’t think I’d be relying on a F-truck over an Isuzu truck out there though - as beautiful and luxurious as they are!
Awesome video team 👏
Mate I reckon next time you go to kinkuna try pine Creek again some spot are scary deep mud
Awesome as usual mate...keep it up 🤙🏼
We need more "Off Grid". The rest of 4wd 24-7 I dont go near.
So Graham how much smaller is the Y62 compared to the "big" American trucks?
I love my ford Ranger although 2L Bi-Turbo i still Love it
If bats are in hibernation (not saying these ones were), disturbing them can kill them because waking up accelerates their metabolism. If they don’t have enough fuel left to burn, they’ll perish
Graham could you please do a cost breakdown on those trips?  Like fuel, camping and such! Im planing a 60 day trip bringing my own ride, renting a truck for the trip so would love a cost breakdown  :)
Great show!
The fish you were catching are eel tailed catfish or what we call in central Qld freshwater jewfish (Jewy’s) or butterjew
Always enjoy your channel Graham.  Back when I was a lot younger we would catch Yellow Belly on pieces of meat from Road kill. I'm a retired 4wd Tour guide and enjoy watching the places you go, I've been to Carnarvon Gorge many times but not where you went, I miss the Gorge. Big Red is not hard to get up slow and steady Low range first gear is all you need, but we will se how you go next episode.
Fresh catfish is called catfish
Living in bundy I would love to know the route you took,  I know the tunnel and gorge
The cameraman’s nearly redundant?  Make an episode from their point of view.  How they get up the tracks before you hit them, what gear they use while they use them and who drives the camera rig.  They’ve brought us the footage for years.🇦🇺👍
The y62 is back Graham uare the man I like your car
just a great show
Excellent series Graham.... Awesome scenery....
Wish people would stop with dinosaurs & the "250,000,000 years ago bullsh!t!
I enjoy watching, but a vehicle worth about 250K and they use a handheld UHF. ;(
Just the best show on the tube. Graham one of the guys that is so natural at what he does, the time flies by when you are watching and it leaves wanting more.
We have a tunnel like that in Kentucky. It's called Nada Tunnel. I wonder, if it's Nada tunnel, what is it. 😂 dad joke
37:43 that is either a fork-tailed or eel tailed cat fish =D
so as an American, I'm curious: if you call a camper, a van, then what do you call a van?
Can you guys please start a 100 Series Build and bring it on the tracks!
Love Liv and Tommy. Hope to see them much more.
Love the 250 ❤
Just Loving it.....well done Graham
I love bearing British place names, completely out of context regarding it's meaning!
Cooper Creek catfish is an eel-tailed freshwater catfish
Great to see Liv and Tom join the Off Grid crew, I hope Steph and Harley make a come back and maybe have a 3 vehicle crew. As to the cutting I think like many others that what was cut out was probably used as fill elsewhere, or maybe if it was taken out in blocks, maybe used for buildings in a nearby town
I am not expert but if I had to guess why they cut through that hill would of been to get it closer to rock so less trees grew on the track, look forward to being corrected or affirmed
Eel tailed cat fish. Not bad chewing if caught in granite country where the water is cleaner... have to skin them with pliers though... tough buggers.
If this was a tryout for Tommy and Liv being your travel partners I vote yes
Mate if you ever want a travel partner I’ve got the next 5yrs free to travel Aus started the trip already @offbeatfamilyadventures
Didn’t throw a yabbie pot in,why?
Nice eating!
1:42 massive you say?
# Graham mate you gotta use cheese,just square bits of cheese the yellow's love em.
It's a eel tailed catfish or sometimes called a butter catfish,good eating nothing like their fork tailed mates,use a float in the fresh,get the bait up out of the mud.
best cooking segment yet!
Ahhh yes big red the desert I named my 2005 Hyundai Terracan 4x4 mod on
Wrapped to see the new couple, hopefully keep them around
Definitely have to agree OFF GRID makes this Channel !!!
Are you guys looking for a couple to tour with you!? We are ready to leave the house lol
It's an eel tailed catfish or a dewfish. Be careful. Their spines are very painful. Good to eat but.
Build a Dakar vehicle for next year please.
28 minutes Chinaman cut,  its only you're height Graham, it looks like a rut to me Pal! My guess is that it was then used to fill in low spots, so it makes sense to cut into the high sandstone deposits along route.
Off grid,enjoyable,if only Shaun was in there..
This episode has a very relaxing, calm and honest feeling about it. Best one yet!
Off-Grid is the best series on YouTube.
WOW WOW WOW love this adventure - more please
The catties look like some kind of eeltail catfish.
My name is/was there. Ben T Davenport Downs.
Hi Graham I think the catfish is called a Acurama Catfish. Great show once again. Love ya work. 😊
I think am gonna love this one though I was used to the previous couple
Sick
Best episode so far beautiful one day ill do  a Canadian on grid
Top ep well done
So good,Graham……so good. I love when a new Off Grid pops up in the feed. Cheers from Enumclaw Washington, USA.
Bat shit 💩 is like paint stripper 😅
My Dad used to tell the nacho cheese joke over 40 years ago
Hello this is Howard from the United States Washington specifically and I've seen many tunnels like this here that don't have tracks anymore but the sit on the ceiling of that tunnel reminds me of a steam train tunnel and would be the same thing if they had to cut into the gradient of a hill so the train could go across it without being derailed g'day mate love your guys's show keep up the good work
43:10 those smoked eggs look so yum! glad you enjoyed our smoked salt too! 🥰🙏 -Raz
Pretty sure that's a Eel tailed cat fish
My father passed last Thursday. I drove my momma, niece and nephew to my aunt's longhorn ranch Tuesday. Today driving home I took them to many Texas historical markers on the way back, including Camp Hearne. My niece is 22, and my nephew is 24 but neither were taught that there were German pow camps in the United States.  Our schools are shit now.
Awesome little museum.
28:05 Im not in construction, but maybe they needed gravel for the road base further up, and there was no quarry around so they just cut into the hill and made the road at the same time and got the gravel they needed.
Have done a lot of drilling in the artesian basin it's an interesting body of water some points it's are a lot further underground then 800m some points it's a couple km underground
GET AWAY FROM THE BATS! We're not playing that game again.  Lol.
Straight to the super duty. Let's see if you like the American trucks. Great touring choice.
Just love your OffGrid episodes. Top of my bucket list is having a beer in the Birdsville pub, had a lemonade when I was a 7 year old kid, but want to upgrade to that beer. 🍻 Was so cool to meet you and Shaun and Melbourne 4x4 show a few months back Graham, keep my motivation going for my 4x4 👍
Legends, Tom, liv and Graeme. Need more of this. DJI action cams are better then gopro every day of the week. The adventure kit is best with 3 batteries and charger case and all the gadgets. 🍻🤙
Great vid lads - what an epic route.   Any chance of getting the nav directions from start to finish ??
Yeah u boys and girl are brave going all the way out there without a Toyota! 😉
38:21 what camping chair is that?
I’ve built a fair amount of permanent and temporary access roads, railway lines and pipelines in some fascinating and remote places around the world over the years including in Aus, PNG and Europe in the last 25 years and I am guessing the reason is not much different for Highway 1 as it is now. It’s basically ‘cut n fill’. You use the material you excavate in one place to fill out a dip o change in gradient elsewhere. If you are planning it well you will also identify good fill material that you can excavate in one place that you can utilise to fill in another place and given that they have cut through rock I am guessing that’s the reason here too. Buy excavating ‘good’ fill from one place it means you level off the overall route but more importantly you don’t have to go importing any fill from other random locations.
Hey dude. We looked for that deal for the camera on the site and couldn't find it. Any tips
Touring (and storytelling) over smashing hard tracks everyday 👌
Off Grid is the best part of this channel. It could stand alone for sure❤
Fresh water fishing in southern Louisiana.  You would be better off using cut up hot dogs for bait and use a cork. (About 1- 1.5 meters from the cork to the bait) and you also would want to"jerk" the line every so often to give the illusion of the bait moving.
Amazing content as always!
Steph and Harley are missed.
Cold smoked eggs are phenomenal!!
Love to see it, thank you
That cp4 in the 6.7 is blowing up just thinking of making that trip.
Next time you fish in fresh water  Try steak strip's or chicken.  Thank me later
I know why Shorty was parked up, but it’d be great to see the ol girl come back. Maybe bring it out for a nature special where Graham goes full David Attenborough.
Eeltail catfish U can put them in your fish tank they keep it clean
as regards the road crews and the sandstone, i expect its the same the world over, the overseer was taking a cut of each labourers wages and didnt want to get things done the quickest way and his bumper wages dried up, sceptical but probably true 🤣. brilliant film again and thankyou for the amazing insights for all of us too far away to see for ourselves.
Eal tailed catfish
Spectacular and that looked like a channel cat here in America. Stay safe out there and love this series!
Bundaberg is my home town
കേരളത്തിലെപ്പോലെ പച്ചപ്പ് ❤❤❤❤
Awesome start to 2025........ Great to see Liv out in the sticks again.  Thanks for the share  🇿🇦🤙👍
Wat a beast, beautiful draught master. And the leeky jerry first hey. Trains. Gold mines flat land. Its why its flatened.
Was funny to see the camera man hand pop up for the smoked eggs lol. Made it feel a bit real and less tv show production and just a good group of friends getting together to make memories. It’s a nice comparison because the production quality is amazing! Keep it up!!!
Love the DJI action cameras I always take mine out everytime I jump on the motorbike 👌🏼
That F250 is a beast 💯
El túnel no se cae aunque no tenga vigas. La forma en U (arco) es lo que le permite soportar el peso.
Love the show, careful guys batshit transmits many diseases.
I'm a fan ❤😂
I love your episodes Graham!! You make me laugh, You make me learn and you make me want to go do it myself 🙂
Definitely the best Off Grid so far, surprised we didn’t see Graham in his Batman suit in the tunnel 😂😂..
I am so jelly. How I wish we could caravanning Australia with Graham 😊😁. Funny enough, we drove past Carnarvon Gorge a few days ago because we only had 1 day and we decided to explore Blackdown Tableland instead. This is our first time road trip this part of qld, we have never been here before and limited time so we cannot pack in much. Thank you Graham for showing us all these attractions and hidden gems. It's on my list to explore next time. Simpson Desert is on our bucket list too.
Bloody brilliant. Love it when I get to see sights I will never visit. Thanks for the trip guys. Looking forward to the next part. ATB regards from the UK
….and people break their necks to go overseas…..🤦🏻‍♂️ I don’t get it! There is so much to see and do in our Australia 🇦🇺 oi..oi…oi!
awesome episode Graham, some epic locations with a lot of history
Hey Graham. I love your program and I love to follow All you guys/girls throug All your fantastic adventures. I notice that you are wearing a new smartwatch on your wrist. What is the manifacture of your New smartwatch? I'm asking course i Can't find a smartwatch with a steel brace here in Denmark, Scandinavia. Keep up the good work❤.  Cincerely Claus from Denmark
I just came home today from being away for 2 weeks and all of our fridges got turned off and man if u were in there u would almost feel like you would die
Love these off grid episodes Thanks graham For the camera tips.👍
Ell Tailed Catfish very good eating if you know how to prepare
That is pretty blue and swollen.
When is that cool old short wheelbase Nissan 4x4 coming back on the channel?
For the cutting through rock road question, asked an ol fella at the pub why this may have been a thing. Apparently it meant less road maintenance if you cut into rock because nothing would grow back there. Also we came to the conclusion depending on the area may have been for prospection reasons while on the way to another place.
What's a rowt?
LIV’S BACK 🎉
Is Stef pregnant?
I've got the osmo action 4 and I love it.
Jalapeños...... pronounced Halapenos. Straya m8 👍
I love watching you guys
I'd  be very, very happy to Graham, love the bush peace and quiet.😊
Was wondering how long before they jumped on the yank tank bandwagon.  Tracks getting closed down?  What how could they do this to us.........
Tried knowing how to fish before you went fishing would help😂😂
What a great start to the New Year.  Awesome episode guys, fantastic to see  Tommy and Liv with you.  I love the off grid series, Graham.
Keep some turtle food in your freezer for those remote spots
Hey Graham, are all of those roads public gazetted roads, or did you travel through private property. I would definitely love to do this particular trip. It looks like a completely awesome journey.
can some body pass on the gps location of this  time stamp please  27:41
Bring back Stef and Harleigh 😢
Bloody good vid guys! Luv the offgrid series. Happy New Year from the Rocky Mountains of Alberta Canada 🇨🇦
I had something similar in my aquarium as a kid and they were called a eel tail catfish at the pet store here but not sure if it’s the same thing 👌🏻
Great episode Graham and 4WD24/7. Fantastic to see Tommy & Liv ŵith you. Hope you get Harley & Steph to join you again as they have grown on me, loverly people. At least Tommy can catch fish for you in Shaun's absence.
Grahame to catch yellow belly and cod in forest water best to fish just before sun down and use medium to large yabby tails aways worked well for me oh and if it works for you you owe me then 🤙
You guys are 3 hours behind in the west Graham 😂 your Mountains will be imitating ours
31:26 Australia was built on the sheep's back.
DJI Action are the ritz Gray.  I had nothing but bugs with the GoPro's, now Ive moved to the DJI I can count on my footage will be good.
Ford in America, especially the F series trucks are the #1 selling trucks with RAM #2 and General Motors #3. I love my F-250 4x4.
Great to see Liv back, along with Tom
I miss shawno, but loved the show anyway. Graham cracks me up at times
always good viewing
its a eel tailed catfish
I absolutely love this show
Covid in a cave 😂 you can always use a booster seat to drive those bigger cars Graham 😂😂😂
Those fish you caught look like  fresh water jew fish. If you caught a bigger one they are good eating for a fresh water fish.
Potentially the earthworks have done what is called a cut & fill. Where they cut / excavate material and reuse it in generally a lower lying area. Therefore could adjust the grade of the hill..
Hooray for Liv and her comedian companion :-) the "watched videos, jar of garlic" piece was gold.
Awesome episode graham love the new kids on the block Liv and Tom. 💯%✅🍻👍
Eel-Tail Catfish
Stonehedge pub said "topless bar staff" beside the front door, you could have had a crack Graham...cough cough...
Is it just me or does Steph and Harley look different this time
Leave it to Graham to out do Shauno on the cooker,, COLD SMOKED EGGS!!! Legend!
You’s were so close to my home town!   “Gayndah” oldest town in QLD hope to see you’s the day you’s come through next
“Too flash for us”
Happy to see Bundy and my favourite beach mentioned in a video finally 🤣🤣🤣
Hot butt alert ALERT Graham.... drive FASTER..!!! Like a Russian in Kusrk....
The wife and I Love it , thanks Graham
Chains not crossed on the Patrol trailer.....  Petrol in Jerrys on the back ... All illegal in Vic at least.....
Another great episode of off grid, Can't wait for the next one 😀. Couple of new faces
Great adventure. I love it!!!.
Ah man, I miss Steph and Harley!
Do you know where the Rock Art is in Birdsville?
I would love to spend a weekend with Graham! he is such a great bloke.
I have an idea they are eel tailed dew. And use a cork to Bob and keep the bait off the bottom. Love Blackall, fantastic outback town. Cheers Peeps.
What a beautiful way to welcome the new year !!!
nice salt water creek crossing straight uo
Much love from KENYA 🇰🇪 EAST AFRICA.
The big ftruck is looking good 👍
I'm not in roadworks, but common sense would say they needed the rock elsewhere, and it's bringing down the gradient. My 93 landcruiser doesn't love hills. Imagine a 1905 truck having a crack.
It's a native Australian fish called Tandanus/eel-tailed catfish
Graham you have the best job. A good thing to try when fresh water fishing is put cheese on your hook instead of worms
Nothing wrong with a good eel tail catfish (also known as freshwater jewfish), get one at a decent size not a bad chew 👌👌
fishing for callop/yellow belly/Golden perch, put 3 or 4 worms on that hook, even better catch some shrimp or yabbies in the river large shrimp or small yabbie is the best bait... maybe a small sinker to get the line out a little bit
Excited for the new episode but where's Steph and Harley?
Awesome show guys. Like this so much more than the “just send it “! Attitude 🫤 . Plus lovely couple to travel with Graham 😇🍺🍺🍺🍺
The defence road is one of my shortcuts! Now I'm going to be stuck behind caravans looking at bridges...  Either way, QLD rules, and respect for reppin' the Tobermorey merch as always.
Fantastic episode
Guano... excellent stuff... except to nostrils.
Kiwi but been here 20 years. Have seen fair bit of the east. Inland never yet. So great to watch  cheers
So the ocean was inland 450 kms at one point but they expect us to beleive that petrol cars and cows farts are boiling the ocean 😂
Millions of years lol...... such an indoctrinated fallacy based on bunk science..... cool yes, but the true cyclic nature of this realm isn't nearly as extended as they have you beLIEve... ARCHAIX for some truer timelines backed up with calculable data might have you questioning a little deeper on what is and has been. Sweet area to explore though, magic country
Brilliant.
nice to see Live again!
I’m jealous of these amazing trips, but it’s motivating me to do some of my own to give my kids some of these same great experiences.
i'm liking where 2025 is going with the content. first 2 rocked
Graham to help you with fishing simply watch the opening scene of Crocodile Dundee two 😁
Finally lol
❤❤❤
Crazy
I think I saw u in Bundy
Graham, we need to see more of your Y62!
Shouldn't be breathing in the tunnel with all the bat's it has a high level of gases
Shawn is not there, so who is carrying grahams beer.....
Been here from the very start love these videos and awsome crews keep up great work guys thanks for sharing
looks awsome
I've been watching you since you guy have started
Wowsers
epic as always 🔥💪🫡
❤ love your videos guys keep it up
1st
