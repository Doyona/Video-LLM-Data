Triple H talking to him like is he’s not CM Punk
The ads are CRAZY on this video!!!! It's nonstop!
#1 Dude repeating Chicago, Chicago,  Chicago knew his assignment. #2 Love the WWE Superstars fan girlling out over the return of their hero. #3 Thank you Stu for saving Punk from Corey Graves reunion. Awkward!
Current World Heavyweight champion btw
Take it seth was took backstage another way 😂
Feels like a different wwe 2 years ago before tko 😢
6:22 The Legend Stuu
If Vince was in charge, would CM Punk be back in WWE?
This needs more ads
Still one of my fav moments
Micheal PS Hayes   PS stands for Pimp Supreme
Then rollins comes through the curtain getting held back by two security guards as hes dragged away: "I WANT YOU, I WANT HIM, I WANT CM PUNK!!!"
2:56 To this day, feels unreal and goosebumps every fkn time 😭❤
Give this man a long title run like he deserves
we need Aj lee's BTS too
Best return of all time
I want to see Tony Khans live reaction when he first saw this knowing he just let Jack Perry hand WWE millions of dollars.
Every single one of those handshakes was full of respect.
Coming back to this after Bayley and Punk said they were going to try to get AJ Lee back and they kept up the promise to each other.
2 years have past and still can't get over how loud the pop was when Cult Of Personality hit!! I remember watching it and seriously my TV set was vibrating thr crowd was that loud......Chicago always brings the volume!
That smile as soon as his music hits. Chills
🥂🥂🥂
just noticed just before he go out , Becky is there and asking him are you exciting
CM Punk took all the chants to him from Cody Randy Seth Sami and Jey USO
Where is Seth Rollins reaction lol?
Bruce Prichard is the epitome of "gluttony"
Imagine an entire arena chanting your name.....
Yeah hunter we get it. Grab those vibrators off your arse.
Him standing in front of the WWE logo in gorilla and hearing Michael Cole's voice must have been a moment for him.
HHH thanks you🎉🎉🎉
5:33 I figured they cut Seth Rollins entering the Gorilla Position
Just appreciating William Regal standing there like the Don Corleone 😂😂
I love Randy's reaction
uno de los mejores Regresos en la Historia de la WWE CM PUNK.
It time start to play the game ❤
The pop was crazy
Randy and punk hugging made my day ❤❤❤❤
who is here after AJ returned after Bailey said "bring her in"?
Holy commercials
It cant be true that none of the wwe wrestlers  knew c.m. Punk was making his appearance that night, b.s.😢
1:03 😢
Recontra over en chicago
4:30  This was my favorite part.  Seeing Charles Robinson!
epic
dom is such a cutie
wheres rollins flipping him off?
You know what’s crazy if you check at 2:44 cm punk asked Becky was she excited and she seemed overjoyed even though we know Seth and Punk had their differences.
Crazy they showed everyone coming through the curtain except Seth lol
Can we please get behind the scenes of AJ Lee's return now?
i love seeing behind the scenes stuff
CM punk is one of my all time favourites and in my gut I just knew he was gonna return , so I stayed awake until 4AM in West London England just to hear his entrance music and the crowd erupted as I was listening to a YouTuber watch along.
they need to release the footage of Aj's return as well now
Especially Seth Rollins was excited about CM Punk's return :)
Becky was ready from the start. She saw the way Seth reacted.
Corey graves and punk meeting was pretty cool
Kinda cool seeing him speak to Becky before he went out
We need the behind the scenes of AJ Lee's return
7:22 Exactly the moment Punk returned 🔥
2:55 The Moment 🎸🔥🗿
5 mins into the video and you already put 10 commercials . Cmon
I used to heard his theme song on gta san andreas
Shut up it was 2023!!!! Feels like yesterday!
Only Seth Rollins wasn't happy about CM PUNK returning to the WWE.
Punk returns  and now AJ is back too...
still give me goosebumps 🔥
Cm punk speaking With becky lynch in backstage
NOW WE WANT BEBIND THE SCENES OF AJ LEE RETURN
Never Say Never… EVER
Bayley said "Bring her in" to Punk? She's talking about AJ Lee right? And he says I'll do what I can. I guess he did.
Can't wait for bts of aj lee and lesnar return ❤
Big middle finger to Tony Khan 😅
'BUT THIS MAN ASSAULTED PEOPLE IN AEW!'  The more you see of Punk back in WWE, the more you come to accept that the problem was not Punk.
11 advertisements in the first 5 minutes of this video. This is the prison world we live in. Only interruption I want, is Stew.
Bro could've said the best there is on that microphone in that ring even at commentary nobody can touch him, but blud decided to stick with chicago
4:55 well CM Punk did it, it took time but it was possible. I can´t wait to watch the Behind the scenes of AJ Lee´s comeback at SmackDown 👀👀👀
randy so funny
Im addicted to rewatching this
Bring Punk back was definitely best for business, he still puts on great matches to this day
I miss the Kayfabe from the old days ; 2000 - 2010..!!
Upload AJ Lee backstage story as well.
You can tell Punk was ready to cry
We all want AJ LEE's return backstage story from wwe.
Little did Becky Lynch know that AJ Lee would make her return as well for her messing with Punk
J'y aurais été, j'en aurais pleuré !
2023 - CM Punk returns 2025 - AJ Lee returns  The world is healing 😌♥️🙏🏻
I will never belive this... It's impossible for me
Who is here after AJ Lee return
6:54 the best part of this video😂😂
Aj lee returns BTS  asap plz 🙏 ❤
I’d love to see a behind the scenes look at AJ Lee’s return now that she and CM Punk are both back in WWE
4:57   Well Bayley, your wish just came true.
8:38 what did he say?
no Punk and Rollins hug moment?
Bayley is telling CM Punk to bring in AJ Lee❤
❤️
ممممممممخخخ خخخخخخخخ خخخخخخ  خمممخخم كممممم كممممم ممممممم مممممم ككمممممم حممممممم مممممممم مممممم ممممممم  مممخمممم  ممممممم
Wish this would’ve happened over seas in Paris or one of those rllyyyt electric crowds the pop would’ve been insaneeeeee
1:08 I wonder if that was Punk apologizing for his beef with Regal?
As i always say Punk is the last legitimate Superstar behind Cena that WWE has organically produced. This was one if not the loudest pop in the modern era. I wasn't even in attendance and sound is defining
The hell was entirely FROZEN 🥶
drew and seth are both pissed because was a bigger than both of them when he left and now he is back punk is still bigger than both of them and yes that includes logan paul
The crowd went total Nuts
You can tell by the way, punk was smiling @2:20 that he was so happy to be back and really that's where he always wanted to be.... He went to aew because he was trying to prove a point....
Any list that doesn't have this as the #1 pop for a WWE return is a fraud list. Love him or hate him, only one return in wrestling was as loud as this... Punk debut in AEW
Hunter and Punk know how to tell a gotdam story...
yeah were still watching this
The amount of respect Punk, Randy and kofi have for each other 🔥
Randy and Punk basically like Shrek and Donkey. "Can I please enjoy my return for 10 minutes!!!"
I don’t think I EVER heard a more primal pop that that in my life !  The roar was intense !!
This makes me so happy.
I love that behind the scenes with triple h and punk want to do a picture of me and you and blow up the internet 😂😂 there rivalry was real and now they have grown and work together its amazing what time can do
That's how hunter cooks
That would NEVER had happened if McMahon was there. Vince’s ego got in his way a lot. Not to mention he’s a total slimeball
Paul Heyman talked hunter and Stephanie Nick Kahn Bruce Pritchard into bringing punk back probably
All time great return wwe
LEGENDARY RETURN!!!
Enjoy him while hes here. CM punk is to sports entertainment what  Bret Hart is to pro wrestling. Best to ever do it
Wonder how Seth really felt about punks return
Weird no seth at the end after randy. An why was triple h peeping
One of best feelings I ever got watching wrestling.
wooow
Wheres rollins tho lmao
4:58 was bailey referring to aj lee?
링 밖에서는 저렇게 웃으면서 인사하니까 너무 좋다
I was thinking today the reason one could have an issue with Punk is if they are the same as punk thus u get the visionary the revolutionary which is similar to the cult of personality.
Goosebumps 😮‍💨♥️📈
Hey Bruce Pritchard... loose a chunk of weight will ya... HOLY FUC you could barely get up those stairs you beached whale?!!!
It's more than 1000 times ❤ Best in the World Punkanomics
why like he?
It was the loudest pop I've ever seen.
Cody was not happy to see him nor was William Regal 😂😂
i absolutely hated how they didn't have him show up during the show, or at least wait till the rumble. it was the biggest return ever, and they had him come out at the end of a show. awful booking
Wow
Michael PS Hayes looking like a retired brother love 😂
Was dope seeing punk and dom reunite after over a decade !
Randy’s reaction was amazing 😂❤️
After watching this again and watching him lose the World Heavyweight Championship Last Night Let’s Us Know He’s Gonna Go Down As One Of the greatest world champions of ALL TIME
BEST IN THE WORLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Awesome
The day hell froze over!
Who tf this that at 3:21?
Dude people interest in wwe waiting for you...that...THAT....is your aura
Dirty Dom outta character 😂
I still get goosebumps watching this
Idk man being a edge fan I still think is rumble return was better
There will be bigger pop than this when you hear  "Lets light it up"
I remember getting peacock just to watch this PPV on the rumor he would appear.   I was absolutely stoked when he finally came out because I thought he wasn’t appearing.
Bailey is the best ❤8 Commerials in 9:30 minutes is not. Stupid worthless pathetic idiots.
We have to see that Seth Interaction at some point in the future because he HAD to have come through there too😭   That being said, can we all thank the real glass in the room with us?
3:35 Triple H was like yeah man I cooked something here for ya 😁
Thank you triple h and Stéphanie McMahon
Punk and Cody with the "Good seeing you here" LMAO
You could tell Punk was also enjoying it so much
They taking to long to put some gold on my boy. Chitown run it
Thank you cm punk now I can sleep well
Great video but had 9 ads before the 5 min mark which hurt
Te queiro dar las gracias cm punk, por haberme regalado tantos momentos tan inolvidables Sin duda alguna eres The Best In The World
The amount of times I saw an ad of seth rollins hitting a frog splash on jey uso 😂😂😂
Cody and punk 😍❤
“How many times have you watched this?” Me: Yes.
This is so heartbeating
Turns out the idiot son in law and doofus daughter did good
Is he nervous?, I am too
What would’ve made this moment go from 100 to 1000 would’ve been in Triple H went out there and shook his hand like Vince did with Eric Bischoff.
Love to see Stephanie embracing him.. the amount of respect he earned from his peers and the younger generation.. welcome home champ
❤
Hope that dude got his phone back at the end lol
Kofi and Punk hugging got me  😢
Is it me or has Amy one else noticed how he as aged in the small time of return
Where's roman reigns summerslam return bts!!!? 😢
Revisiting
The day hell froze over.
I know it’s late but I just can’t explain it any other way but as someone who loves CM punk and has idolised him since I was a child it’s so good to see him in a happy place
EL HIJO ILUSTRE DE CHICAGO! CM PUNK
He’s so juiced up!!! There’s no drug on earth that can match this high
I have never in my life seen so many ads in one video I am getting bombarded by ads
Mad to see him look nervous
Who would've ever thought you would see C.M. Punk working with Vince McMahon's "doofus son-in-law" & "idiotic daughter", again?...
Wait so him and H are cool now? Seems like triple H has blessed him that was triple H right? Before he came out?
😢😢😢
Mmmm no love from seth 😂
I've finally gotten around to watching this. Love how they don't show Rollins interacting with Punk. Good editing ;)
Guys do like my comment, so that i can rewatch everytime u like
Te quiero mucho, CM Punk
TK made a huge mistake of letting Punk leave, and now WWE is on the mission to dismantle the "other company" for good.
2:43  I just realized PUNK is talking to Becky Lynch there .
“You wanna put out a picture of me and you and blow up the internet?” That’s just absolutely hilarious to me for some reason. 😂😂😂
How could anyone dislike this dude
3:13 when ur walking into heaven
Standing infront of Steph talkin to HHH after all those low blows lol
Feels impossible to find a greater return of all time than this!
Isiah lister cm punk return @ survivor series 2023 wwe universe on their feet
Dude Looks like , Paul Walker in some angle..😃
So Stephanie just sits in Gorilla and takes up space.
That’s what MEN are… no matter what… putting those differences aside no matter how bad…. And being MEN
8:12 the croud voice ♥️♥️
If Punk did not leave, then the WWE management will not realize the error of their ways and vice versa. CM Punks journey made him realize the error of his ways. Both Triple H and Punk are older and wiser
I’m getting the pointing picture 😂😂😂
7:12
Cool seeing Real behind the scenes
6:55 Randy Orton is the BEST
Because of kayfabe/likely some real life tension, it's gonna be a long time before we see the Punk/Seth backstage reunion but man...I'd kill for that footage
Triple H telling Punk “whatever you want to do” for the picture. He just cares about the talent
And I thought, not a single person from WWE knew about his return.
the eyes of dominik, turn on light
Seth was such a little brat having a meltdown in the middle of the ring like that.. hell they all stepped being in a feud and started chatting about this happening 😅😅😅😅
Who wanna see 2012 lesnar return behind scene
I never noticed he was talking to Becky Lynch right there
If CM punk age 60 I think he still strongest
Why he have to watch every match he is the ceo
Regal looks so focused
im not crying, are you?
Cm punk fired front AEW 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂 aew invented behind the scenes...  now wwe doing what they do best...  coping other wrestling production 😂😂😂  bitters 😂😂😂  dx was only an nWo wannabe
Greatest moment in professional wrestling history
Thank you jungle boy for making this moment possible
Honestly, it was spoiled because of WWE booking Survivor Series in Chicago, they should've had this happen at the Royal Rumble, have him come out between 15 and 30, IMAGINE THE POP!
That "Chigaco" guy had a top ten moment of his life that night.
Orion’s reaction 😂❤️ it’s amazing who he used to be, and what he has become.
Where's Seth?😂
people don't understand how good cm punk has been over this year. He's had bangers after bangers. Name one thats a bad match for him. And i'll tell you, not even a single one. He even came out in a towel to save priest man. Damn... who does that. Probably should be in the goat conversation. Even being absent for like, 7 years... he still made it look like he was the best in the world. Dude is a gem. Please treat him. lovingly.
Off tv Randy is the best no joke
Where was Seth Rollins in this video or did they intentionally edit him out 😂
Watching this after punk main eventing Mania , still feels like a dream ✨
just dont make him fight kane thas all he will stay 😁
Only Seth was mad 😂 from this moment to now 😂
4:36 Becky Lynch didnt greet Punk or maintaining kayfabe because of Seth? 😂
Leave the game or the game will leave you
To date I still watch this and smile 🥹❤️
3:17 who's she??
Man he got that road warrior pop . Hasn’t happened in years
That hug between Punk and Kofi was wholesome 💯💪
sera que poderiamos ter aj de volta ? gostaria muito de vela no ring novamente
Randy Orton really nice guy..
I mean this has to be the greatest return/biggest pop in history?
5:40 Seeing Dominik and Punk meet flashing me back to the happy birthday song with punk in the SES. I wonder what was going through Dom's mind.
How old were you when knew wwe it's not real
Chills. Every. Single. Time
Man punk and Kofi are like brothers
wwe like faimly happy to see that
They all are a big family behind the scenes
6:55 what did Randy Orton say to CM Punk ? Hey you ***** 😂😂😂😂
5:03 Phil ! Yeah ! You wanna go take a picture me and you blow up the internet ? Love it !
The biggest crowd roar in WWE history
Pueden venir 1000 retornos más, pero este se me paran los pelos cada vez que lo veo, de hecho hasta me emociona, cuantas años esperamos este momento y que no hubiera Spoiler fue lo mejor.
Seeing Punk and Cody back together in WWE after they reunited in AEW is so wholesome
CM Punk to Kofi Kingston "You're my favourite!" ❤😢
Se ve poco feeling, poca quimica con William Regal en verdad 😅😅
This looks less chaotic then what punk described in the interview with ice cubes kid lol
its annoying seeing Bayley here after knowing how becky screwed her out of wrestlemania 41.
These are my favorite videos. BTS of the pops. The returns. The raw emotions before it. I’d watch a full show of just this LOL
Greatest return of all time❤❤❤❤❤
And in 2025, CM Punk fulfilled his wish to main event Wrestlemania
You damn well know Cody and Punk couldnt have returned like this in WWE if Vince was there Papa Paul🙏❤️
This was great. I wish they did more behind the scenes of them behind the curtain before memorable entrances
Goosebumps. Unforgottable
4:51 i know where that hands been 😂😂😂
Cm Punk Cm Punk Cm Punk Cm Punk
Moments like these is why I’ve been a fan of all wrestling since I was a kid in the eighties.
The Randy Morton part is the best 😂😂😂  Bailey too
That's how you do it.
Cm punk best ❤👊⚡
As an actor who's been in theatre been very inconsistent, partly because of my own issues, all of this seems so relatable. Its almost as if I've lived this exact moment in my life.
This was so good and I’m happy that we can all see now it’s worked and was the correct decision and now triple h and cm punk are actually getting on great .  I loved the reaction of the fans , as soon as his music hit stroke h and Bruce Pritchard regal and co must of been like oh yes this works 😂 one thing I loved tho was the reaction of a lot of the wrestlers, that hug with kofi was a genuine hug between two good friends. I wasn’t a punk fan originally I have to be honest but much like Cody his performances have won me over , they both out in such wonderful matches that are really passionate
5:57 Phil and Kofi friendship and warm hug 🥺🥺🤍
I'm smiling like a doofus watching this. No pun intended 😅
Seeing Randy & Punk is so wholesome ❤
Right before mania his pops are still huge, what a great decision by trips and punk to just set everything aside for… “what’s best for business.”
The tension between Phil and Regal after Phil called him a stooge 😂
CM Punk just randomly hugging someone from the audience is hilarious😂😂
Man, Punk is in my top 3 of all time and i'm glad he's back where he belongs in WWE. All the BS that has been said or written about him over the years has only made him more popular
Randy's reaction was great 🤣
6:20  Does someone here say “Coles gay!”?
Great video. Well done, HHH
CM PUNK 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 WWE champ 2025!!!!!
It was Nick Khan that approached Triple H about reaching out to Punk. What a great business move!
I don’t know how many times but punk u beauty ❤❤❤❤ and HHH u mastermind 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
CM Punk in WWE just feel right tbh
Aha, they didn't show Seth Rollins in the back... some walls you don't wanna break. ;)
Por cierto Team Bron Breakker,Cm Punk,John cena, The Rock y stone cold steve austin ❤
Traer de vuelta la emoción y las buenas promos ,claro ,triple cine trallendo a cm punk y nuevos talentos ❤🎥💪👏🏻🧉
Dude meeting Randy is on my bucket list
Man I fkn love Bayley🤣
Damn bro watching this made me cry wtf
Damn this man looked genuinely happy for this
Let's go son
Happy to see HHH and punk being friends again And finally they recognize  cm punk is special.
“Oh, you gonna point at me?” I love that! 😂
Rollinns went and hid under Becky Lynchs skirt 😂😂😂😂
Seeing stephanie give a little smirk of approval of Punk being back was the icing to the moment I didn't know I needed to see. 0:38
Did punk smack that guys phone into the crowd
I notice they didn't show Seth going backstage hmmmmm
Only one person gets mad  during CM Punk return he was Seth Rollins🤣🤣🤣
This will go down as THE greatest wrestling return of all time. It was unexpected. The timing was perfect. Had us feeling like the show was over. Thought this would never happen, and it did. Having one of his best runs of his career too. Always loved CM Punk. So happy he’s home
Best Return ever, watch that again and again since it happened ❤❤❤❤Thank you HHH
Stu!
This feels like when Adam Cole showed up on AEW....then right after Bryan Danielson lol
Company Man Punk.
I want a demon balor vs cm punk feud
Love seeing this they are really a big family
WHOS HERE IN 2025
4:51 Stephanie was about to give him a hug
7:09 “I’m all sweaty, I’m all sweaty” “I don’t care, I don’t care brother” omg 😭
3:18
Not the headset with custom cowboy hat compatibility 😂😂😂
Super heartwarming especially the bond now with Orton, HHH, Punk and Steph
Where's Seth? lol. There's becky
Great moment
I love seeing this BTS footage. Love it.
Bayley hugging Punk was the happies moment❤
P.S. Hayes the real "Styling and profiling"
The twins, Usos why didn’t the other one replace his brother I was just asking💕💕
Randy's reaction 😅
God damn man still gives me goosebumps
Randy Orton never ever looks not like a stud
I love “Wanna put up a picture of you and me and blow up the Internet?”
5:27 two of AEW’s biggest stars      Tony Khan must be fuming 😂😂😂😂
Where is Bayleys bear hug???? We want to see it
Love how you can see Becky behind Bayley looking uncomfortable as she realized "Oh fook seths gonna never shut up about this" 😂
Seeing regal here makes me very happy
The og is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
6:55
Randy 😂😂😂
"You're my favorite." - Punk to Kofi
Man i need a documentary on this 😭❤
0:36 if Steph’s looks can speak. She’s just as happy and excited to have him back and bury the hatchet.
Who’s the black guy in the video?
This was so cool to see backstage.. But you didn’t see becky or Rollins come up and hug or do anything with him.. hopefully they will get a long
Imagine!!!! After cm punk walks out 45 seconds later, triple h walks out to his own intro. They have a 15 second state down. Than have a smile and dab it than the fans go wild. And walk out. Next Monday night raw triple h cm Punk walks out together and triple h announces he am punks manager and they go on for a good streak good story line in their some where tha. It comes down to some back stab and they fight it out one last time handshake hands after that match the end!
Top 3 pop ups ever
Man i felt so nervous in myself for punk brfore he went out! Imagine how he felt 😂😊
Randy's playful "what the hell man" moment in the back...😊
Triple H's the ish
CM punk ❤❤❤❤❤
And now he's in the main event of wrestelmania
3:18
Gives me goosebumps every time I see this video
Ok, now add the pop he got when he showed up in Chcago on AEW Dynamite. 2 returns, 2 of the loudest pops ever, Same Guy
How cool is everyone here. What a positive place.
Just look at those reactions of people seeing him. What a cancer this guy is!!!
What a moment.
This is the absolutely best thing that AEW ever did.
The best thing that ever happened to this company was Vince McMahon selling it to TKO. The changes that have happened have all been for the best! Seeing CM Punk again is awesome!!
thanks HHH
The day I started watching WWE again. Thanks HHH.
The girl in 0:00 😮
Still can’t believe CM Punk came back to WWE. We would never thought he would come back
What a moment to be alive
Great video with cm punk returning I a huge fan of the wwe
This is the difference between a company who can put business first, us the fans first  instead of their egos.  Thank you so so much from all of us as wrestling fans, truly.
2:00 mark no screaming no yelling. HHH just guiding the right ideas to help is crew. Pure leader
Vince McMahon's doofus son-in-law totally delivered. 🔥
Still giving me chills...love this return 🔥🔥
No return or reaction will ever get close thank u tony 😂
5:45: Jamie Noble?
W❤
“CAN I NOT GET 10 MINUTES” 😂😂
The fact that they got 2 huge pops in one match is crazy
You  really see both the excitement fear and adrenaline of coming back at 2:16 that’s awesome
You heard him talk about how nervous he was and all the emotions he was feeling. I honestly thought it was mostly fluff and he was exaggerating but you can see it all in his face
Que increible, muchas veces me imagine el regreso de Punk, pero ya a estas alturas nunca pensé que fuera a suceder. Increíble. CM PUNK LEYENDA. Brincaba de un lugar a otro como si tuviera 13 años de nuevo. NO me canso de verlo
not that important, but imagine just being a every day person backstage and then you see punk walk past you after all that time.  ya be like wait is that punk, what the heck
I like how Triple H gets his picture taken with all the wrestlers. To me it feels like he hasn't forgotten what it's like to be a fan
Beautiful in so many ways. ❤
I love him so much! 😭
I love the interaction with Orton and Punk lol
GOAT
0:46 Anyone else remember Regal making punk tap back in his day? Some moment this was
Man I just love CM Punk.
Crying now in 25 March 2025 in South Africa 9:31 AM watching this
Dude that's CM punk
When that CM punk music hits, the nolstagia
I got goosebumps on my arms watching this i can only imagine how punk felt
CM PUNK IS MY FK CHILDHOOD
The only thing that could have  made this moment better is HHH going out and  rasing punks  hand
Why am now just hearing someone say “Cole’s gay 6:20
Stu the cameraman has been spotted 😮😮😮
Too bad Hornswoggle McMahon wasn’t there with him 😂
Dom being all shy and polite is weirdly wholesome
Randy 😂😂😂😂😂
2023? Wow seems like it was just yesterday
i come again and again and still gets shocked
5:20 I'm surprised Seth Rollins didn't come in with everyone
I was shocked cm punk returns
Man that looks AWESOME being CM Punk at that moment, wow
The Rock Star Of Pro Wrestling
BEST IN THE WORLD*
Still Goosebumps 😮
Randy was hilarious 😂
Gotta be one of the top 5 pops ever. It's amazing how he kept it together emotionally and not tear up from the reaction and all the love from the crowd.
Hunter proved that night that no bridge is ever truly burned
HHH has been great as head of creative. What makes him good is that he's open minded and knows what the fans really wants. He brought Punk back and isn't afraid to bring TNA guys to WWE programming (like Joe Hendry for exemple). And turning Cena heel. That would never happened under Vince.  I'm from the attitude era and gave up on WWE during the super Cena days because it was super vanilla and extremely predictable. But i can say that now i'm back as a full time fan since HHH took over. It''s been MUCH better. Thank you Paul !!!
HHH !! My god what a damn legend!! Understands wrestling at it's core!!
Respect for them keeping out the interactions that would’ve put a stain on punks biggest fueds since being back
Idk why every time i see him hug steph it makes  me happpy
I waited for 10 long years for his return - Guess we all did
really hope he gets his wrestlemania moment next month! can't wait to find out what the favor is
Still can’t believe my GOAT returned
2:59
thank you tony, jack perry for this.
When you are the Best, you are the Best ❤️
I wanna see the younger guys reaction like austin theroy because he grew up in the ruthless/pg era
❤🎉
One of my favourites ❤CMPUNK
When Randy said “Can I get 10 mins…..!!” 😂😂😂
Now we just need Seths reaction after walking backstage😂😂😂.
*HOW DOES THIS ONLY HAVE 2.1 MILLION VIEWS!*
As the old timers would say, that's a Road Warrior Pop!!
william regal wow. thats a face i havent seen in a min
Cm punk is home where he belongs
Always great to see BBL Bayley make an appearance
5:05 "you want to put out a picture with me and you blow up the internet?" damn, HHH really knows how to play the Game
That Sami Punk hello was so awkward
Imagine coming back after Vince is finally gone....only to have Bruce Prichard show up to escort you to gorilla lmao
Triple H peeking out of the curtain constantly is hilarious
I know Stephanie told triple  h to shake his hand😊
Ngl it’s so good to see these superstars not act and show who they truly are
Punk and Dom made me cheese hella hard 😂
Triple H apenas fazendo o serviço de um diretor ali, puta que pariu, que loucura, que incrível
That smirk on 3:00 like he knows he still the boss
Love this
still missing AJ
I'm so jaded I don't smile at much but I smiled the whole time for this one. What a vindication.
5:48 - nobody talking about Doms face . He’s getting flashbacks of straight edge society days
6:55 randy is amazing
Chicago Chicago Chicago
I have not heard a louder pop in a long time. That crowd was primed for this moment.
😎
Seth Rollins was punching the air watching this dude is so jealous bc he knows he will never get this reaction
Like the Bruce Wayne returns in the dark knight rises
Where would WWE be without HHH? Gawd d9mn
His name was chanted for more than 10 years, in this absence, and then THAT pop??!!!! Put this guy in the WWE HOF right nooooow!!!
This… is… amazing
Love him or hate him...that pop was massive! Not sure I've ever seen Orton smile like that before lol.
Hell really froze over here
Punk n regal god what an underrated feud….
He’s home where HE BELONGED!!
I love how they act like they haven't been sneak dissing each other for years😂
I don’t know if i ever heard a louder crowd reaction than this return. Even edge wasn’t that loud…and it blew the roof also
The ads are horrible
I Love You CM Punk
Randy is hilarious
It is mind-blowing watching this again right after listening to the CM Punk shoot interview with Colt Cabana recently
10 years ago this man once says. "Doofus son in law."
The Girl at the start in the back couldnt believe her eyes ^^
CM Punk standing beside William Regal? That's all I need to see...
CM PUNK   THE MAN RETURNS .
0:03 the face of the girl jajajajaja
This is one of those returns where I can watch this over and over again and never get sick of it. It puts a genuine smile on my face to see Punk happy and everyone welcoming him back with open arms. I feel like WWE has been better all around since he came back. Like everyone there is operating on an elevated level now. Not saying its all him, but his return put a spark in that locker room.
I do wish he would have kept this haircut.
Worst return ever could be the best in history 😔
Was that Michael Hayes in the white suit? If it was thank you for bringing us the hardyz man.. 🙏🏼
So interesting they didn’t show Seth. I am sure he came back the same as everyone else. Would’ve loved to have seen that, but I understand why.
This is spectacular. On the fly, in the moment stuff.
This is why in the wrestling business you never say never
Hhh peaking like a little kid
HHH is a straight Dog!!! We were lucky to have the worlds greatest heel when we did
No one is as professional as HHH. Bro overlooked everything from the past and decided to rehire Cm Punk.
Wwe is in good hands
8:30 🔥🔥🔥
Punk is best 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Randy is not upset because Triple H told him that Punk would be coming back. At least he was given the heads up.
Everyone’s family when they step foot into the WWE.
the dude at the 9:00 mark screaming chicago over and over is the best
CM SUCKS
Seeing them not in character laughing with him is kinda weird lol
What did Punk call Stephanie and Hunter during his infamous but legendary pipe bomb?  Idiotic Daughter and Doofus Son-In-Law?   12 years later....
I wanted Rollings to come through the curtains
Randy’s reaction was absolutely golden 😂😂😂😂
I hope Punk wins at the Elimination Chamber that’s all I want for my birthday 😭🙌🏼🔥
Bienvenido a casa..
The greatest return of all time!
That little moment when he and Cody shook hands and their eyes met and they both just...knew. Wow.
want the fantastic wwe24 docu's bck. wwe backsage stuff is my favorite stuff over all over the last years and the only thing i like to watch meanwhile
This was beautiful to see.
6:56 RANDY ORTON IS A GEM😂😂😂
I know it's kinda late but man seeing William Regal back in WWE, is just awesome!
COLDEST RETURN of all time Goosebumps to this day
Im from Chicago and almost met CM Punk around 2008/2009. My uncle is a CPD officer and around thanksgiving time, he was supposed to come to my uncles station for a tour and a ride along in a squad car. My uncle said "do you know a mr cm punk?" I said "YES". He goes: "Hes coming to my station tomorrow for a tour." I was excited..Then they said he cancelled his plan the day before and i never got to meet him. I did meet Will Ferrell though in 2006 😅
What a moment he feels
He looks nervous at the start, we need a 2 hour documentary
Damian Prist And Rhea Ripley & Undertaker
anyone felt that? when punk hugged kofi?
Watching before he wins rumble
Hearing Bailey say "bring her in" didn't take them long to start asking him to get AJ back lol
3:18 Damn
Where is Seth’s reaction is the real question???
Didn’t realise he was interacting with Becky just before he went out.  Anyone know what he said to her just as his music hit?
Idk if anyone else clocked but Samantha saying to William Regal "Thank you Mr Regal" during Punk and Kofi's hug was so pure, professional and respectful. She's certainly missed in WWE.
He had a little interaction with Becky! That's gotta hurt Seth hahaha
Shield break up Seth cash in mania End of streak Debut of sting Return of punk  Unforgettable moments
As soon as Cult of Personality hits.. you can see this man lock tf in
Great return
Ortons' reaction might be my favourite like mf can't I have ten minutes?
5:20 “good seeing you HERE” hmmm
3:37 when I hear my neighbors arguing outside
The day hell froze over lol thank god Vince wasn’t in control or this moment would not have happened!
Randy's reaction makes me smile everytime 😊
💟
I tear up when he hugs kofi
They didn't show his interaction with Seth
Call me crazy, but I can't wait for punk to be GM of Raw
3:45 imagine if HHH walked up right behind him during the return 😂
6:20 STUUU?
The soil they needed to bury AEW for good 😂
I wanted to see more of that Randy Orton & CM Punk interaction!!!!!
Little old Phill 😂 welcome back Mr Second City Saint.
My HERO My Idol
Please make a full documentary of his Return after he wins Royal Rumble 2025
do it more behind the scene video like this
Best thing that to come out of 2023/24 I was so overjoyed when I seen CM bunk come back
Stephanie looked so happy
Randy Orton & Punk’s reunion could cure depression.
Can you imagine how absolutely insane it’ll be if AJ came back? That place would lose its mind HARDDDDD!
Step aside Roman, the real deal is back
2:00 vince mcmahon is very lucky to have triple h to be his son-in-law.
Did anybody notice the security lady in 0:06 going like this: 😮
The hug between Punk and Kofi man
Punk And Kofi Hugging Made Me A Little Teary Eyed 😢Glad Punk Is Back Man
I love randy and punk  they need to teamup
The only thing missing from this picture perfect return…      Micheal Cole tweaking the hell out
CM Punk is back baby
This was the best day ever glad I got to experience this in person
So cool that wwe lets us see this.
Loved seeing all the people in the back supporting him and congratulating him even after their matches. Especially ortons reaxtion
La que veo ahi molesta en Beky Linch
These behind the scene moments are very interesting
This was one of the best moments of the year
I love seeing these backstage segments
They were both a part of survivor series 2006, now they’re both still here 18 years later
2:42 it was becky😭😭😭😭
Really want punk to win the rumble ... and the title at wrestlemania main event dont care what night just GIVE HIM THE MAIN EVENT HE DESERVES AND WIN IT ALL...
look at the lady in the hallways mouth fall open when she see's punk right at the start of the video lol
Cm punk
The way hhh looking out there making sure it’s the reaction right 😂😂😂😂
Chills wow
2:56  goosebumps  ... eternally ... i literally jumped off my couch so fast i knocked off and smashed my coffee mug i was drinking   hell froze over.... long may he reign ............B I T W !
By far the most unexpected and best return in WWE history.
Cm punk vs códy rhodes
how many times has Punk 'returned' LUL.. this has to be the 15th time?
Greatest return in the history of WWE !! The GOAT 🐐 CM PUNK 🐐
Randy at the end tho LMAO
It's all Bayleys fault.
Chicago will never have another Cm punk , what a aura this guy have
The Kofi embrace still warms my heart. THAT is his favorite Kingston in professional wrestling.
What a entry CM punk 💥💥💥💥💥💥
🥱
I’m still waiting to see wwe 24 documentary from cm punk
I am one of those guys that have been waiting for your return...m happy you are back.
I don't even think the rock could have electrified a pop like that!  Truly the best on the stick and in the ring! Tell me when I'm telling lies!
Haha take that AEW fanboys
Can't believe the pipebomb was almost 15yrs ago
Randy and him was great
Memories ❤️
Paul is trying to save the WWE from Vince's screw ups.
Just beautiful
Wait I’m gonna point back at him … just CM Punk things ❤😂
4:04 the screem in the background😭😭
Haha Randy
Everyone knows it’s Entertainment. Glad that they let us see the behind the scenes these days.
Punk could do a match or a feud with anyone who walked through that curtain, and it would be gold.
this was the best night of my life
After watching the podcast episode of O’Shea Jackson with cm punk, punk legit describe how it was  and it is 100% right and that’s I respect bout punk bro is always honest with the fans no Bs thrown out
This is art man.
Every time I watch this, the reaction Orton gives breaks me up
Stephanie Hugging CM Punk. Hell Has Froze Over.
I bet when Tony Khan watched this happen his butt hairs curled up
❤❤❤
I wish I could give more than 1 heart, this makes me so happy. I watch it again and again. Love the emotion from everyone involved.
That moment watching Trips look out there, man I can feel the eagerness and want to go back out there. Think about a feud between the two. If only he could
@9:00 I wonder if there in Chicago... just a guess...
He will forever be loyal to HHH for being able to come home.
I love to see how superstars act off-camera, that they are friends and talk to each other hahaha
I'm big fan of the rock but the return of cm punk is the best return of all time ❤❤
HHH at 3:42 - Hot damn did I just cook here!
CM Punk
I would also watch a doc on this return I hope they recorded everything
that static is really up there w the glass shattering to produce the most pop
look at lady`s face at 0.03 mark. That there says it all.
"Well I'll be damned ,I thought i was in Texas, Hell i'm not in Texas....I'm in AFGHANISTAN!!!"-Vince McMahon
Ty hhh for bringing punk back
LIKE MUSSOLINI 🔥🔥🔥
Him returning is the best thing ever wwe history
Man i love real glass
Cory graves and Randy give a genuine hello. All the Misfits.
Rhea and Kofi are the only genuine greetings. 😂😂😂
Goosebumps
Dom N nick didnt give him a hand 🤣🤣🤣
just noticed the security guys mouth drop at the very beginning lol
"You going to point at me"  That was a total shot at Tony Khan for always pointing at people he's getting a photo taken with lol 👉🏼👈🏼
CM Punk is real money.. Any video of him on youtube crosses million views now a days... I am sure Triple H didn't anticpate that when he onboarded him... This has been probably the best return in pro wrestling history
3:41 - Triple H : That should help put another nail in AEWs coffin
"PERFECT"
Enough to make a man cry yooooo
why not book Stu vs cena WM41
I still can’t believe Cody and Punk are in WWE now.
Michael Hayes looks as ridiculous as ever, I love it.
Rhea was starstruck when she saw Phil.
The welcome home pat on the back from Bruce was awesome. What a moment.
2:56
Literally everyone stoped what they were doing backstage trying to get a peek lol
Seeing this brought a tear to my eye because Pink always knew where home was and he's back home now. Bring AJ back now please
Punk is so happy to be back
bro the only person we didn’t see is seth how funny
Dom looked a tad starstruck when Punk spoke to him.
Orton is the man no questions asked
Comparing the return/debut of CM Punk in WWE and AEW behind the scenes is day and night
who would have thought of the sight seeing both stephanie and paul hugging him after they constantly buried him on tv
Is this the biggest pop in history?
Love watching these behind the scenes.
I still think it's crazy that the "internet buzz" was what led to CM Punk's return to WWE.  The fans wanted this so bad that they all saw "easter eggs" that were not actually meant to be that.  The fans wanted it which led to both WWE and Punk wanting it but they still hadn't talked(mostly due to WWE thinking there had to be some kind of no compete clause).  But the momentum continued to build until both sides had NO CHOICE.  It had to happen at that moment in time.
HHH being in charge of WWE is the greatest thing to ever happen to the company.
Feed us more
We want more CM Punk Behind the scenes
"I don't care brother" - CM Punk
Haha him and Steph hugged
Everyone was happy to see Punk. Or well...most people. Yet who didn't we see come through the curtain to greet Punk? Seth Rollins🤣. Anyways, this was amazing to see. Love Punk! And Randy's reaction was amazing🤣. "Can't I enjoy 10 minutes of my own fu*#$ng return?!" 🤣🤣
Love how authoritative HHH is when telling Punk to 'GO TO THE FRONT OF THE CAGES!'.
I PRAYED FOR THIS AND IT HAPPENED!!!!
"Wanna go blow up the internet with me?" Paul is a legend.
my inner child is just LOVING this behind the scenes stuff theyre giving us nowadays. Ever since i found out it was sccripted i always wanted to know how things were when they werent acting
please make a video like this as well for John Cena on his last debut next year.
Getting Trips to hug and say Congratulations Bro.... man... imagine them back in 2013-14
The best part of it is Punk giving his opinion but still confirming with Hunter about what exactly to do. Perfect for the business. 1:58
It's clever how they keep seth apart and distant to him
I'm a 49 year old grown man, this shouldn't make me as happy as it did, does.
GOAT of WWE CM Punk
Bailey is such a waifu material man
It's been a year and I still can't believe it
The moment with Randy after the match is heart warming and comedy at the same time
Even as I have grown older and learnt that the business is scripted and the internet has killed alot of returns and Kayfabe, hearing yhe static hit I jumped out of my seat and screamed like I was 10 years old again.   Welcome back CM Punk
The fact that his is only 9 minutes is criminal
Triple H should have went out there and pointing at Punk and said, Look what I did.
Triple H was looking and waiting for Punk from curtain was wholesome moment for me
Thank you, Jack Perry
Hes Home!!!
What if CM Punk didn't have Coffee or Tea on that day and he was grumpy lol
Punk only returned for the hugs
Wwe just casually breaking the internet.
Survivor 2024 was such a massive disappointment. It will never top 2023.
@3:18🍑
The moment he went back after his return, I kept wondering where did Seth Rollins go when everyone welcomed him back. BUT MAN OH MAN WAS IT GREAT SEEING HIM RETURN! I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD. And the backstage moments he had with HHH and Stephanie were nice, seemed like a closure moment for all of them.
3:41 That look on Triple H's face speaks volumes
Who else watched this with a big smile?
Next ALBERTOOOO DEEEEELLLL RIIIIIIOOOOOO
one of the best wwe moments for sure punk came home
Punk got rescued from the AEW prison.
3:46 Triple H smiling because he knows he has money lol
Where's that crying AEW fan at?
The face of the woman right at the beginning is brilliant. Also, seeing him reunited with all the people he knows and likes is really wholesome
Imagine WWE had used the decibel meter on his return.. I get it was his home crowd but still, that was crazy loud...
Whether you love or hate CM Punk, you can't deny this was one of the best moments in WWE for many years.  I've always been a fan of Punk's and seeing how well everyone interacted is just awesome to witness.  That might've been the loudest pop for a WWE event in a decade.  Thank you WWE and CM Punk for giving us that epic moment.
Like how Rhodes said "here" when saying it was good to see Punk
hey mr REGAL
Insane crowd roar reacted like knee reflex
HHH being the first to greet him and ask "how'd that feel?"  Man things have changed, Punk looks so fkn happy!
Just give us a full documentary about thisss ❤
Choking Jack Perry was the cannon event that led to this.
2 seconds in the security girl jaw dropped
I was there that night, I've been to tons of WWE events in and out of state. I brought my brother with seeing as he hadn't been to a WWE event as an adult. Let's just say nothing will top what he and myself experienced that night. Biggest and loudest pop, the arena was damn near shaking.
Michael Hayes still dressing like a dork
🥹🥹🥹 Me seeing triple H and CM Punk interact
Otc
This is incredible, loudest wrestling pop I’ve ever heard 😮
Orton's reaction 😂😂😂
They Explain him about 2 Shark Cages 4 Times already it's Like Lost Kid Trying to get HOME and some Good Strangers Telling Him to which way to go :D
Punk for me to the WWE... is almost what Wolverine is to the X-Men!!! Hell, they even look close ⚟
Punk made plain white T-shirt cool again
Has a Chicagoan so proud! Seriously makes me cry well deserved pop!
Imagine the pop AJ would bring dude! We NEED this power couple in WWE
2:27 and this video just got glorious
We really need Seth backstage response🙏🏻😩
The night that began the descent of Knight... the top of the ladder got a few rungs higher.
Make the return of ryback, alberto delreo, dean ambrose, kane, stone cold, goldberg,big show, john cena, edge, rvd, kurt angel, triple h, undertaker make next wrestlemania legends wrestlemania 🙏🏻
Triple h has brought them all back!! Bruno warrior and now punk!!!
This was a great watch!!
Randy’s great lmao
The one comeback no one thought would ever happen... i'm so happy i was able to witness his whole journey so far ❤ what a rollercoaster of emotions  Can't wait to see more of him in WWE!
Triple H was a proud man
Gee, I thought Hunter was gonna do a run-in and attack Punk 😂😂😂😂😂😂
BEST IN THE WORLD
I'm not much into the modern scene, having grown up watching the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, but Punk is one of my last favorite guys before I walked away. It's good to see that he came back.  Randy's reaction was great. Talk about a guy who's come a long way.
It still feels surreal even after watching it hundreds of time....... As WWE guy (will always be till my last breath) since attitude Era I can say that this moment of making return is one of the all time greatest moments there can be....... We can definitely count this with THE CURATAIN CALL and THE END OF AN ERA MOMENT and STREAK ENDING MOMENT
My dawg dom remember that segment all this years ago with cm punk and Rey
el aura de randy orton es unico
Cm Punk ❤️🥹🙌 WWE
I can bet my bottom dollar Mr Regal makes this go through and changes minds on what people thought about Punk
Seth had some serious issues with punk... His interaction was totally ignored in this video..
6:36 is that Marq Quen (one half of AEW tag team Private Party) ?  Looks just like him. 👀
Where's Rollins 😂
Lmao I just watch an interview he really didn't know what to do
Everyone: "hey man welcome back, nice to see you!"  Randy: "AYYYY YOU F**king #&@!%#$#"
I would have been so nervous lol….and there’s only a couple people in the world who can say “wanna take a picture together and blow up the internet” and it’s gonna happen and Triple H is one of them
رجعت اشاهد مصارعة عشانه
The most explosive and most anticipated return in WWE history for real
I smiled so hard when he was hugging Kofi that my face hurts now.
Mr.Randy 0%ego
Watched this live a year ago at 4 am. local time!!!  Asked myself a few times, am i sleeping????  Awesome moment!
Maaaaaan watching him shake hands with everyone and have the little banters with old friends and new faces... It's just heartwarming
I remember I said after the match I said, " I guess it was a rumor after all." Then Cult of Personality plays and It was pandemonium at the Horizon(All State arena)
Still cant believe it after watching it for the 100 th time.If you had a time machine went back to 09 and daid that in 2023 CM PUNK would be back in the WWE ...... .
Welcome to the wwe  The best in the world  Cmpunk
So glad CM punk has come back, However They shouldn't have done it the same night that Randy Orton come back
loving Punk this run
Where was Seth? 😁😂😂
You can just tell that everyone has grown up and are now better people because of one guys absence. I love it. Triple H especially feels like a complete 180. I believe in my heart of hearts that he is exactly where he is supposed to be. Great great, great video, guys.
We need a full documentary on this. I want to hear how he felt when he went out there. Those chills must have been THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!
It's nice to see Steph still working with Paul backstage.
During his interview with Ariel Helwani, Punk mentioned a moment where he had just gotten to the venue and boarded a freight elevator with a group of other talent. I would've loved to be a fly on the wall for that moment when they realized Punk was behind them.
Honestly, I LOVE those video so much. Behind the scene, out of character, „faces“ and „heels“ together, calling CM Punk „Phil“ etc. Pure enjoyment.
Paul said WELCOME BACK
Randy Orton is a top dude man 😂
…… so was that actually Kofi? Kind of weird you didn’t see his face
6:55 Randy & Punk.
Punk should've said "can i wear your blazer?" after he came back to gorilla
Is ot me or did Bruce Pritchard not look too happy Punk was there? I bet he was like "If Vince were here, he wouldnt like this!" Lol😂
Esse retorno foi EXTRAORDINÁRIO!
If A&E ever does another season of WWE Biographies, I'd love to see an episode on CM Punk as well as ones on AJ Styles, Bryan Danielson and Sting.
Punk and Orton reuniting is awesome!
Dom was a teen the last time he and Punk interacted was when he feuded with Rey in ‘09 so I bet it was crazy reuniting.
C m punk ❤❤❤
The best in the world is back
Steph's hug looked so genuine
4:55 "I f*king knew it"
bro flipped off CM PUNK and hugged him come on rhea
Man he looks nervous as hell
The greatest return
Bayley is so happy to see cm punk back ❤
Is the documentary coming out in January when they go to Netflix?
Triple H ..he loves this company
living legend❤
I wanted to see how Seth reacted, where did they take Seth, that would have been interesting to see how Seth reacted
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🥹🥹👏🏾👏🏾
I really wanted him to Return at Royal rumble 😢❤and  when nobody is expecting him 2 return & he could've gotten the Greatest Pop & comeback in the historg of wwe
Cm punk my favorite wrestler everybody miss him. I’m so proud of him a man he become sometimes sometimes at least something and come back to a different attitude, but he did great things in WWE. He changed the game so that’s what WWE needs a game changer. That’s all it is now the ball is changing now let’s see if we can do more. I cannot wait for the matches to Singapore is going to be and I cannot wait. Let’s go. let’s get it in let
Such a dream career for an avg guy
2023 entry, 2024 exit. Who is the writer here?
Seath Rollins 😅😅😅
Watching this i hate to say it but maybe the problem with wwe was and always will be vince mcmahon
The storytelling and tv we have got from the bucks has been mesmerising, thank you Matthew and Nicholas
3:35 - Triple H hearing all that dollar sign doing its " kaching " sound.
Bayley is such a good friend. I know a lot of people were excited to see him, but it seems like she made the most effort to BE THERE.
"Real glass go cry me a river"  7 words the led to a chain reaction towards this. Thank you Jack Perry lol
His moment with Randy, and their vibe re watching their mania match. Awesome.   Randy's arc is so wild. From one of the biggest dickheads in the business to one of the nicest guys.
Happy Thanksgiving to Adam Page, TYB, Jack Perry, and Tony Khan for this moment! 🦃
how he said sorry to Regal
Is that Road Dogg standing there at start just as they go up steps?
The gang's all here
He return on my birthday 2:58
Bayley zoomin
where is Drew lol
cm punk explained this in a podcast long ago hahahaha happened exactly like he said
🙏🏿💯☝🏿💪🏿🥂
Damn Vinnie Mac retired on us 😂😂😂😆 the atmosphere looks comfortable
How com seth is not backstage
Hhh did impossible that's why he is the game
2:55 I will never forget this moment, the feelings, emotions what i felt that night as soon as i heard that music...
This was one of the best things WWE did in a decade.
I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to watch the second city saint
so finally where is the chicago fans phone????
Michael Hayes looks like old school Uncle Howdy
This is one of the best WWE videos I’ve seen
It was loud as f—- in the arena and round the world that night TONY WAS Scared to Death by the whole world because of this moment holy cow I knew it would happen and I KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT UNTIL HE CAME OUT SO TRUE FOR THIS MOMENT AND I WAS HAPPY AND STOP THE DOUBTERS ON ME BECAUSE OF THIS
Damn, gorilla is fancy af these days
I swear Im watching Dom become 12 years old again 😅
Oh wow... Crazy Phill was beating up everybody backstage! JEEZ
The moment AEW lost
I was waiting to hear something about Randy Orton's thoughts on CM Punk coming back the same PLE that Randy Orton came back. Gotta love Randy Orton
Only 1.5 million views? This deserves a billion!
P.S. Hayes, William Regal, Triple H, and Punk in one room. So cool!
"I'll do what I can, you do your job and I'll do mine."  GET READY TO LEARN THE LYRICS TO LET'S LIGHT IT UP BUDDIES
Prolly the greatest return ever no cap
Thanks for the forecast! Could you help me with something unrelated: I have a SafePal wallet with USDT, and I have the seed phrase. (alarm fetch churn bridge exercise tape speak race clerk couch crater letter). Could you explain how to move them to Binance?
a complete and utter waste of time.
"I double dog dare ya!" Bruce is the best.
Well the story of this told by CM Punk was a bit more dramatic than it turned out it actually was but I'll cut him some slack since his adrenaline was probably running so hard. 😂
Biggest return of all time❤❤
Every wrestler seems a little off
2:57 his face when he heard the pop
7:45 I was screaming in my room. I stopped watching wrestling back in 2016 and only started at WrestleMania 39. Seeing my favorite wrestler return to WWE was surreal and im happy it coincided with me getting back into wrestling.
To see this was a beautiful moment!!! From punk to hhh to all the boys and girls staying back to see him or congratulate him for being big enough to return!!! Randy is my favorite but i wasn’t even mad about this spot!!!!
5:53 That smile, that damned smile.
This was the moment WWE put a stake through AEW heart and they have never recovered
BEST IN GALACTIK!!!
I know “Vince” is a bad word in wrestling now, but one of the best things he taught HHH was business over feelings. Give the fans what they want. I commend HHH for that, because without that, we wouldn’t have Punk return. Props to both of them for maturing and putting their past behind them.
0:49 isn't that Brother Love?
Nice to see Bobby Roode in the back wth a headset on. At least his talents are being utilized somehow and hes not just left at home forgotten.
I can watch this documentary of Punk's return like 10x and still not be okay.
The Chicago guy is everywhere man
It’s so nice to see a guy like Punk bring a man like me 41 years old he brought me back to wrestling in 2004 and if you see how happy he is after the AEW bs is over!! I can’t put it into words I watched this and I teared up because my guy is happy for the first time in years if you have a heart and someone bring a fan like me back three different times over the last 20 years I am happy Punk is happy!! I mean I am a fan of Stone Cold, The Rock, Ric Flair HBK Punk is just different for me. It’s a great picture to see a legend always put his principles ahead of his career and then come back and still gets a pop like a legend I have seen in my 37 years of being a professional wrestling fan thank you Punk for bringing me back to what I loved as a kid but got so ridiculous after Wcw closed up shop.
Thanks to wwe for opening up this side of the business to us. Pro wrestling is real… i love how the company is going
So nicee ❤😂😊
Best return of all time
I got like 50 ads from this almost 10 minute video
You didn't see the hug with Seth
We got CM Punk back in WWE before GTA6
It’s my personal belief that HHH never had serious heat with CMpunk.    That WM match that Punk didn’t want with hhh, Vince didn’t have a match for punk and hhh tried to get him on the card. In hindsight, neither were wrong.    HHH was playing his cards and couldn’t tell CMPunk that he was trying to get a head seat with the company.    Punk leaves and Vince goes down hill so now HHH can get back to 10 years ago.   Hhh was never against cm punk.  He just had to stand by with his father in law to get where he is today.
Where's Seth Cussing 😂😂😂
Thank You AEW....Punk is Home 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
In this short video you can see so many little things that matter.   - CM Punk is having obvious lamp fever - HHH is a real pro without any anger in him towards punk (you can see it tbh) - Regal is super reserved towards Punk (the rumor is saying that they dont like each other) - HHH is a mark like we all are - Punk is without any hatred and reservation. he really is happy to be back  I love every second of it. We need more Backstage stuff!
Gracias Triple Milagros por hacer esto posible :)
2:55 6:55
CM PUNK
3:23 who's this chick?
That Bayley is so hot right now.
Can I not enjoy 10 minutes of my F***** return (Randy Orton Nov 2023)
Uff⚡⚡⚡
El punketo rompio el internet de forma q nunca nadie lo habia hecho
This chokes me up. So f'n happy he came back.
Cm Punk, Sir is my Best WWE Super Star. 👌👌👍
I swear I cried with emotion as if I were a little 15-year-old fan again in 2014 when this damn sob music came on.
The Best un the world ¡CM PUNK!
Y’all, I tried this WWE guessing game called Brainbuster, and it’s tougher than a steel cage match. 😂 Learned so much along the way! Just Google ‘WWE Brainbuster Game’ and see if you can do better!
Why is this injury prone CM flop being shown on our screens no one asked to see this no one asked for this too appear at all & no one asked for him to come back too wwe
Got a goosebump everytime watching CM Punk's return video...... :<
This is what wrestling is best at time shock moments and returns of people u thought you might not ever of seen it was truly amazing and I like punk now more than b4 cheers
This is what happens when you put business over personal issues in the right way, one of the greatest moments of all time in WWE
Its nice to see that Regal Recovered after Max smashed him in the neck.😂
Only him can give this vibe 😮
The last Megastar of  pro wrestling ❤❤
I'm all sweaty  I don't care brother ❤❤
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Regal had his game face on the whole time
CM Punk and Dom have history back to The Straight Edge Society 😂
Poor Corey Graves 😂
Cm punk is the reason I'm restart watching WWE
The EST is a joke of a gimmick
They should definitely make a documentary about this return
Did anyone notice? Everyone from the ring greet & congratulated him except one man, Seth Freaking Rollins. They can't stand each other IRL. Just thinking about how electrifying their match is gonna be at wrestlemania gives me goosebumps🔥
Look at Kratos
Cm cuck
The best in the world 🤘🏼😎
What no welcome back hug from his "good freind" Seth Rollins ?!? Lol😂.
Man I was looking for Seth 😂😂 to come through and hug him him and Drew. y'all know they were backstage waiting on him to laugh and talk they had stay in character.
I called that one on Ango two weeks or a week before that just like that only thing he didn't do was sit pipe bomb style but rather than that 99% right.👍🏿💯
Bro Cody and punk say Good seeing you to each other 😂
It's funny how Cm looks nervous.
You can see the security guard's expression at the start with her face in shock when she realizes it's Punk.
Punk looks so genuinely happy to be back and it's amazing to see
Legitimately one of the coolest things ever. This video is everything!!!
Dom’s probably the nicest person ever, don’t let him fool you
this is the game i love
I'mnot crying you are😢😢
the amount of love and respect they all show each other shows wwe is a healthy workplace and im proud of triple H for making it that way :)
This whole video is goosebump inducing.
Man what a blessing it would be to be a part of there bond and family!
So good to see cm punk back in WWE 🔥🔥yessir.
Lol i saw the video about CM Punk talking about this days before this. It was funny.
alr now aj coming or wha…
Funny seth hates cm punk and his wife becky was in backstage
No triple H= No Punk The company is better without the devil
I’m sorry but who tf cut his hair 😭😭😭 they did him dirty
I think this pop is even bigger than Stone Cold return. Possibly the greatest of all time. What a moment
Cm punk ❤ is love
It’s crazy how bad AEW fumbled their only star
Biggest Pop in WWE History? You can here the surprise and "WTF" in it, fcking love it
YOU COULD TELL PUNK WAS NERVOUS AND EXCITED HE REALLY HAS TWO OF THE BIGGEST RETURNS TOP 5-10 ALL TIME
lmao they didnt show when cry baby Rollins walked in
Happy Thanksgiving C M punk
Thank you Hunter finally that moment was true cm punk finally returns to wwe a decade hiatus vince is still in wwe ounk never ever coming Hunter best for business ever ❤️❤️❤️
Randy orton is legend not ego he and punk long time friends
Cm punk
Cm punk n Seth Rollins that would  great
Triple h best in business ❤
I never cried and screamed so loud before at this moment .. my fiancé Will and I were so excited. Such a great memory with my love .. unfortunately Will passed away dec 27th 2023 but this is a great memory of us both being excited
So I saw Becky Linch on backstage seemed happy for his return. I'm still confused about if was a real beef between Punk and Rollins or it was just part of the kayfabe?
1 año desde que volví a creer en la vida
Thank you, TK, for making this moment happen!! 😂😂😂
The random Jamie Noble 🫡
Best return ever in next  25 years
You'd think they would put this on the Vault channel
Ooh, they're cooking, they're cooking hard. Orton/Cm Punk returns, best rib in the world.
They trimmed the Seth Rollins part 😂😂 !! Hipe we get what happened between two someday later
The timing of the moment when the show was officially over is incredible, the crowd went crazy. We want more of this backstage moment.
10 años pero regreso a casa ❤
When you go from working with kids in AEW, to professional adults in WWE, it makes a huge difference.
Where was Seth Rollins
CM Punk is number one in WWE
Behind the scenes, we're all family~~~
Thanks  and FY  jack Perry!!!
6:56 will forever be the best thing from this
0:46 CM Punk wins the IC title from him back in 2008
Even in behind the scenes, they didn’t show Seth or Drew
Thank you Hunter ❤
still got me goosebumps
WWE is a close as it will ever get to the Attitude Era right now...
Triple H probably said to Stephanie and his kids okay I’m going to work Randy Orton  and CM Punk are coming back ! Stephanie most likely said I’m coming also call the babysitter .
What is Doc wearing? 😭😭😭
Greatest return in WWE history biggest pop EVER!
Show the backstage moment with Seth Rollins 😂😂😂😂
Him asking Becky if she's excited and her asking if they're going to play his music with a big grin got me, miss Becky
THANK YOU JACK PERRY
Notice that they are not showing any interaction between Punk, Becky, nor Seth.
The moment when it has fully sunk in that he is about to make his WWE return 2:19.
And he only went on to have the feud of the year!! 😂😂😂
I’m all sweaty…. I don’t care brother!!!
this is why i love wrestling. It might take 7 years, but at the end of the day every one of these guys are brothers and it shows. What an awesome moment
I like seeing him and triple h putting the past behind.
Lol randys reaction
6:56 😂😂😂😂😂
🐐
AEW will never recover
I want Randy Orton returns backstage behind the scenes........❤❤❤❤💎💎💎
The best part about this video is we do not see Seth Rollins.
3:16 BAYLEY 🤣🤣🤣 language!
4:57 we all know who's bayley wants at this moment. I just hope she back at least on royal rumble 😅😅
Only see wwe for CM PUNK BEST IN THE WORLD 👊🏼❌️
Its so cool to see how the wwe operates behind closed doors. Thank you for uploading this wwe. I love how wwe is giving us more premium content here on YouTube.
the interaction between punk and Cody its like hey nice to see you again knowing they were in aew just 2 years prior
That dofus son in law line hits way harder now
I forgot he came back during the Survivor series last year it was from Chicago
Punk had INSTANT respect. They all know what he did for the industry!!
Orton out of kayfabe is goat jajaja
Why no Seth reaction 🤣
Bayley totally marking out is relatable! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗
I'm not gonna lie, every time i see cm punk's return i got emotional, it was fkin amazing!
4:48 Bayley told CM Punk "Bring her in" referring to Aj Lee🥺♥️
This is the moment when Tony Khan knew he drop the ball.
The best thing that has ever happened to Vince 2023
I love that you can hear Trip say "Go" immediately followed by "I'm not kidding you" to the production team
5:59 new tag team champions when Kofi and Woods break up
BEST SINCE DAY ONE!!!!
Cm punk Cm punk Cm punk
Paul is saving WWE as we know it PUNKS BACK NEVER HAPPENED WITH VINCE
Notice they didn't show Seth 😂
Randy s Reaction 😂😂😂
@2:55 What did he say to Lynch?
Like him or hate him CM Punk is one of the biggest draws in wrestling today
JAMES GIBSON CAMEO
Wait I thought Punk talked bad to Regal when he was in AEW. Guess that was more Meltzer bs reporting lmao.
Wife stealer
the loudest pop I have ever seen 😮❤
He looked so nervous when he was first brought through into gorilla
Regal wasn’t happy 😂
You don’t know how much you changed my life by coming back. I was in such a low place but this brightened up my future. Thank you
I love the interaction with dom calling dom SIR bc the last time cm punk was in WWE dom was still in highschool
Now i want to see the backstage moments of Seth and Drew
This moment was the definition of "never say never"
The day the wrestling world froze
thanks to jungle boy and tony for sending him back to where he belongs
So good! Punk is our hero and WWE is pro wrestling. Nothing else even comes close.
THEY CUT OUT SETH. I WANT TO SEE SETH.
Kofi & Punk 🥲
You can see how far CM Punk aka Phil Brooks had to humble himself before the machine that is WWE.  Phil went to the other side and seen the grass isn't greener, it's rotten and seen he only had one way to save what was left of his legacy.
Stood no chance at UFC.
❤
CM Punk. The reason I returned to watching wrestling after a near 10 year break.
Ironic Video After The Pipe Bomb
Can they not have this video chock full of adds its only 9 minutes why does it have to have legit 10 ads. Don't you have enough money? There's more ads than WWE content on their videos it's insane Lmao
Best thing about that video was when Randy came up to CM Punk at the end😂
Best return of all time, will never be topped.
7 ads in a 9 minute video. wtf @youtube
C m punk❤❤❤
Damn I got goosebumps and I wasn't even there!
Kofi and cm punk bros fr
Seeing Punk and Stephanie share a hug gave me chills
6:57 Randy is hilarious 😭😭
I smile the whole 10pm of this vid.  This will always the biggest return EVER completed surprise
CM punk rockzzzz wwe champion soon
I have been patiently waiting for this ❤
And how soon did commentary know???
Did Hunter tell Cole to say “electric to say the least”??
Best WWE return ever
Look at that. It’s Punk, McMahon, Pritchard, Levesque, Hayes, Regal. Whole gang.
This is top notch content 🤌🏻
been waiting a year for this video 🙌🙌
AEW > CM PUNK  THEN NOW AND FOREVER 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
goosebumps every single time!
Not pictured, someone fearing for their life.
Best moment in wrestling history!
Gotta hand it to Punk for finding peace and solace in this. I hope it lasts. By comparison, look at Bret. If Bret has taught us anything, it would be to not hold onto bitterness.
Let’s blow  the internet
Is Brother Love Pritchard still in the WWE ??
It's very nice to see people age like fine qine and be mature now to put the past behind, 10 years was a long time indeed! Triple H, Punk, Orton, Cody, Sami. It's been a year and no reports of any backstage shenanigans of Punk. Best decision to be back in WWE, the long wait was worth it!
Why didn't you show Seth Rollins' wrath?
Please roman return sumerslam video back stag
Well Punk is right WWE is where the big boys play!
The cake on Bayley🥵🥵
I’ve watched this like 10 times now
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
This is sooo amazing... though this made me wonder, why now apart for WARGAMES?
This moment is awesome I was shocked when I heard the music to punk
A lot of people saw him backstage, but no spoilers came out until his music hit. That is just amazing.
One of those hell froze over moments in WWE history
pure magic
Imagine that feeling when he’s walking out all those people hearing his music. That would be unbelievable
I need to see BTS footage of Roman's return now
🥱  I'm so bored of punk debuting every 30 seconds.  I'm more interested in the new day feud. It's new & fresh.
I love Randy and Punk's interactions.
Best entry in the world ❤❤❤❤❤
we want aslo see behind the scence when dean ambrose returns
Randy Orton is absolute mood
this had ronda rousey and Stephanie written all over it, its a pity he didnt go and shake the guys hands
I imagine just Regal telling him .. "I understand what you been through" :P
Thank you so much for showing us these behind the scenes moments.  Please don't stop!
I don’t get why it takes a year for WWE to release this footage?
MasterChef level cooking
No Seth Rollins? This feud finna feed families come Wrestlemania season
CM Punk is like the Deadpool of Wrestling. Lol he’s wrestling Jesus 😂😂💯.
I love it how they show us this backstage stuff and seeing how these wrestlers are feeling backstage and seeing what they are seeing . Something that we don’t see everyday. What path that they take from backstage to the ring.
This Is What He's The Best🔥 In The Wold🌎...
GOAT cm punk ❤
Randy Orton was funny here lol.
We want roman Reigns summer slam 2024 behind scene please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank you WWE for later releasing this 1 year later.  It's fantastic to see.  Punk looked nervous.  As if they wouldn't blow the roof off the place.  Believing in that it and it actually happening it appears are 2 different things.
Haters always gonna hate , Punk’s always gonna be a goat 🐐
I love that Dominick doesn't even give him a hug.   Also seeing Regal there is amazing considering he was in AEW at the start of the year.
Doesn't matter how many times I watch this, I always get goosebumps😅
I swear i could watch hrs of just cameras following Punk around. He's a magnet of interest
I love backstage footage. I need more. Of everything
Lmao, I'd like to imagine Punk's train of thought when he walked out of that curtain. 🤣   "Okay, two rings, he wants me to walk to the middl- wait, Seth is mad AF right there, should I still come there? 🤣"
Watching that pop still gives me goosebumps. Being there and a part of that was completely different than what you heard on tv. It sounded like a swarm of unhinged wrestling fans and it was unworldly!
Talk about fumbling the bag. AEW has never been the same since Punk left.
You can see in his eyes. He was home FR! ❤
Love love love backstage Gorilla Position videos like this! Goosebumps watching it last year. Even more goosebumps re-watching this POV!
Taker returned at Survivor Series 2005, Sting made his debut at Survivor Series 2014, CM Punk returned at Survivor Series 2023. Who will come  back home this Survivor Series 2024? I am thinking Becky Lynch, Trish Stratus, Goldberg, Charlotte Flair or possibly Brock Lesnar.
I kinda hope we get a 24 CM puck documentary
I think the interactions with Punk and HHH were really interesting. It was a look into the unique world of professional wrestling. At it's heart, it's a business, and the real professionals are willing to put any personal issues aside when they have a chance to make money together "Let's break the internet."  That one cracked me up.
This was a true goose bump inducing moment. One of the greatest returns in WWF/WWE history. When the crowd goes from loud to bat-bleep crazy in an instant, something special is happening.
El mejor del mundo
The day AEW got burn to the ground
Hunter calling shots from gorilla in a major PPV is super cool to see also.
If you have heard/watch how CM Punk described the return and then watched this, it was absolutely word to word. Insane POP 🎉
WELCOME HOME CM PUNK! ❤️🙏
Very clever not showing Seth Rollins here
The look on Punk’s face when he realized Michael Hayes is still dressing like that.
6:39 the "Hell Froze Over" moment
9 minutes is just not enough haha new WWE docs need to start happening on netflix PLEASEEEEEE
This behind-the-scenes video seems like a sneak peek at a documentary on CM Punk's return and how it all came together.
CMPunk rules!!! 🔥
Steve Austin himself said it was the loudest pop he ever heard!
0:36 the only one McMahon i'm happy to see,,   Stephanie
This is still unreal.
Where is Seth Rollins 😢
I just want to see footage of him interacting with everyone when he first came back
0:54 I had the same look after seeing that suit
That dude that yells CHICAGO when punk walks out is a vibe deadass cause that’s exactly how I felt and I’m from LA
No Seth 💀
Something funny about seeing Cody, Regal and Punk backstage and knowing the neckbearded incels are getting so salty
He's Back!!
Where is seth ?
Disaster avoided when Punk asks Hunter exactly where he's supposed to stand
Triple has that smug look on his face, like it’s over for Tony now lmaoo
I'm honestly surprised he hasn't gotten in William Regal's face and called him a stooge yet.  I guess that happens when you are a spite hire.  Short leash.  I honestly can't believe they even let him sniff around backstage in NXT after that bikini girl video resurfaced.
imagine if stephanie marry undertaker instead of HHH
one of the best return of all time
Thank you Tony Kahn and Jack Perry for being the biggest idiots of wrestling and making this return possible. AEW continues to go down since this return happened  Literally the greatest return of all time
I wanted to see Seth Rollins walk back!
I've been smiling for 9:30 minutes straight, this made my day
The thunder at 2:58 is unreal, i jump with excitment everytime i see that part
Roman raings ka bhi SummerSlam ka return wala videos lao TV  Bhai
He was so respectful was paying attention to every little thing it’s beautiful to see that
cm punk❤
1 year later still getting goosebumps 🔥 We definitely need a full doc…H
Traditionalists hate this kayfabe breaking stuff but it makes me love and appreciate WWE that much more.
I guess all the peeps who called Punk a liar after his interview with Ari, when he said it was all hugs, can enjoy their feet in their mouths.
BEST return of CM Punk Survivor Series 2023 in CM Punk HOMETOWN🔥🔥🔥🔥
The energy in the building and backstage really was something else that night
0:45 Punk meeting the Triple H stooge lmao
damn i wanted this to answer if rollins was kayfabing or genuinely pissed off.. they showed everyone but him lol
What a moment man.
I really, really believed that he’s going to come back one day. And he did. I’m so glad I witnessed it.
Wwe has doing the wonderful plan to bring back the C.M Punk. Really this is making me as a goose bumps. It is resembles vintage Superstars Rock & Undertaker Epic entrance.
This is amazing guys, truly spectacular and so emotional 🦋🦋🦋
Hey WWE why don't we chill tf out on the ads. 4 in a 9 minute video is fkin ridiculous dude
Even CM PUNKs pet Larry is now a DRAW in WWE & in merchandise section than TIN-POT AEW 😂
Plz upload the behind the scenes of roman reigns return in summerslam 2024
GOSSHHHHH THE BIGGEST MOMENT WITH HIS RETURN WAS HIS EPIC LONG RIVALRY WITH DREW MCINYTRE 😭🔥 2024 BELONGS TO DREW AND CM PUNK
Notice they left out Seth heading to the back post-Punk's return...
This is the best wrestling content of any kind that I've seen in a long time. More please.
the night tony khan truly feared for this life
Randy orton so funny 😂😂
BuuuuuSh@#$$ La Punky is so selfish
Cm Punk, Michael Hayes and Brother Love in one shot!
From this moment I came back to watch WWE every single week  I’ve been away from watching wrestling since 2016
Still cant believe I had floor seats by the ramp for this show. My first time attending a Survivor Series event. 🔥🔥🔥 & had my kids with me  I'll never forget it.
Que joyaaaa
I think there was a video in between my ads
I will love H for ever for doing this❤
Dom and Punk is Chilling Backstage🤣 not in the ring duh
Can I enjoy 10 minutes of my return?! hahahha
we can see all these Backstage scene is insane!
One of the Legend!
HHH DIDN'T TELL ANYONE THE PUNK WAS COMING. I'm Pretty Sure Alot Of Superstars Was Not Happy About That.  We All Know SETH Wasn't.  Seth Reaction Wasn't Scripted At All.
Only Seth didn't go backstage to greet him 😂😂
Anyone notice the poor dude’s iPhone get whipped across the Allstate Arena at 9:06 when Punk decided to break free from the hug? 🤣
What did Rollins do show us that too 😂
This was cool, you can feel the anticipation and the pop was crazy!!  Also CMP’s return here to me is like the comeback for WWE and we haven’t fully seen everything yet 😎😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩👏👏👏👏👏👏
Finally seen Stu
Regal and Punk talking while Cody’s music plays is just telling.
A good strategy for Triple H to finish a premium live event and then make CM Punk's return  from cm punk so that later both on the Internet and on TV channels they returned to the program SIMPLY EPIC
Who is the black producer?
Of course you edited out everything about Seth reaction to this...
Am I the only one who has watched this over a millions times already 😂
It’s cool seeing Punk and Dom. I remember when Dom was a kid and was involved with his dad’s program with Punk
You can tell Bruce and punk do not like eachother 😂
Brilliant 👏
The crowd going wild.. best reaction ever in WWE history
Can WWE make more CM Punk Stuff (do a doc of CM PUNK VS Seth)
Punk standing with regale was so nice to see
William Regal was not really happy but I guess CM Punk don’t care
William Regal is an absolute legend.
Randy's reaction is so sweet
Its now been a freaking year and we still watching
He’s Home… love to see the backstage relationships you see how genuine they are to each other.
"I'm not here to make friends, i'm here watching CM Punk outlandish return to WWE."
1:56
its does'nt feel long even i replayed many moments of it
Remember to thank Tony Khan everyone, because if it wasn’t for him being a terrible boss, not knowing how to run a company, and being too scared to say anything to his employees, this moment would’ve never been possible
MORE OF THIS.
6:56 😂
I swear that eruption made steel beams shake loose
Imagine if Trips uploaded photo of him and Punk 5 seconds before Punks music hits
bayley hug him twice
I love these little peeks behind the scenes
ive watched wwe all my life, gone and watched the older stuff like the attitude era. ive never heard a pop as loud as when punks music hit.
🎞️🎥🚬
The horrible experience in AEW changed him made him appreciate WWE resulting in this amazing return.
Just a big bunch of friends.
Which entrance did Seth Rollins use lol
Sounds odd but these sort of videos remind me when I used to do theater a lot as a kid and teenager. Same sort of vibes lol
I wanted to see Seth 😂😂
Aura
Yes CM Punk is toxic and Mercedes Money is a megastar
Y did seth didn't meet in backstage
The biggest mark for CM Punk is Phil Brooks 😂
That crowd pop man 😂😂😂😂😂  hhh is the man who made wwe cool again lets go 👌👌👌👌👌👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Brock Lesnar back wwe 😍
Best return ever
You can see Dominic turn into a fan right as about he's about to greet cm punk
I’m only 7:14 in and I already got 4 ads what is this
9 minutes, 20 adverts .. That's normal seriously ???
I remember this day like very well. I remember the teases every week on Raw, all the think pieces on Punk’s potential return on twitter. I remember Meltzer stating that “it would never happen” and Punk got a “resounding no” from WWE.   I remember the genuine excitement at the idea. Safe to say, I was ready for heartbreak. I’ll never forget the sound of the static and  my goat walking out to a massive pop.  And Who can forget the subsequent meltdown on the internet??? I lived on twitter the whole of November 25-26😅😅😅  Still feels sweet.
Regal not looking best pleased by the whole thing. Really closed body language throughout and kinda awkward anyone know what the story is there?
SETH ROLLINS:😡🤬😡🤬😡😡🤬😡🤬😡
2009 randy would've punted Punk for ruining his return
still get goosebumps to this day watching this!!
Thank you Jungle Boy Jack Perry. ❤
Wow this was great!!!!
“it's gonna get taken over by his idiotic daughter and his doofus son-in-law”  How times have changed
THE BEST RETURN EVER❤❤❤
Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre didn't say hi, their loss.
Triple h go to the front off the 2 cages
i looooove behind the scenes footage...i will always watch things like this. really enjoyed how passionate Paul Lavesque is about placement for the best lighting purposes. he's producing like a champion
His debut at AEW was much louder
thank you Jack!
Punk nervous? Never, well, he was when he came home
The lady with the 😮 face in the beginning. She absolutely marked out haha
Let's do one for Roman Reigns at SummerSlam
That's not 2014 cm punk
The single greatest return in wrestling history and it’s not even close, it will probably never be beaten either.
Great video. Loved the part when CM Punk hugged Kofi Kingston so warmly and said "you're my favourite" 🥹🥹
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love Punk and all, but just find it sad how he judt sort of pussied out. Hes happy to scream and shout and criticize everyone but then folds over when the money is right. All those years hammering Steph/HHH/Vince/WWE in general, then this. I guess it comes with age, and I'd rather be a wealthy chilled guy, then a not as wealthy angry guy, as a 20+ yr fan, its hard not to see him as a bit of a hypocrite. Didn’t need to see that Steph hug/handshake though 🤢 Hope he stays healthy now, though, most of all.
CM punk is the goat
You can see the pressure of asseptance in is eyes
Insane moment for everybody, even Punk himself.
Behind the scenes of Randy Orton
I wish we could of seen how Seth came back thru the curtain lmao
Drew? Seth?
Wish I could go back and relive that again 😂🔥
"I get the Triple H pointing picture?" that popped me
One of the biggest, if not THE BIGGEST pop in WWE history!
One of the best return
Did they cut out the interaction with seth rollins as he was coming in ?
😊😊😊
Best return for Cm Punk
Punk should have kept this hairstyle. Looks fresh af on him
I'm sure you all wanted to see him and Seth, but I was waiting for him and Corey.   They had a crazy falling out, and to know (from their words) that they patched it up compared to how... prickly... that handshake was... good to see them able to air out the laundry.
The most caught off guard return I've ever witnessed ❤
I love how at first you can see Punk is nervous, the adrenaline kicking in as he waits to go out from Gorilla. But he’s smiling, doing what he can to ease his nerves - then as soon as Bruce Pritchard says ‘here we go!’, he just turns it on and he’s ready to go. It was also heartwarming to see the handshakes and hugs from everyone, especially Triple H, Stephanie, Kofi and Randy.
Everything Punk touches turns into Gold. Let me rephrase: "Punk is money"
The little interaction with dom was wholesome
Hell has Frozen over. Hell is still Frozen after he joined the O.G Bloodline
Wee need shield plzz
Is it already a year since the return of the Best In The World?
Randy had me dying bro, 10 minutes and then Punk shows up lmao
While drew wasnt there due to minor injury. We alllllp know whos the one person not so happy and probably took other way to backstage and not be in gorilla
Ok I confess something  1 I have watched WWE since 2016 and never watched full raw live but only watch reviews and ple live  When cm punk return to raw for the first time in years then I tune raw live for whole damn 3 hrs and till then to now I watch every episode of raw live  I'm a  Roman fan but I like cm punk also and now he's team with otc  Holy hell  It's the best time to be a wrestling fan
He just keeps changing the game. And I just know AEW fan boys are crying having to watch this again a year on while they stuff their faces with cheetos. CM PUNK IS BACK YA BASTARDS!
Does punk not like michael hayes? Their interaction seems weird
that was really amazing i can't believe it thank you hunter
Oh so cool to watch WWE again Because of CM Punk.
❤❤❤
Wwe looks like a very happy environment under hhh. Everyone is family. I’m so fcking happy Vince is gone. Wwe is so hot right now
I thought R Truth is the most favorite superstar back stage....maybe he is..CM Punk comes second.
The crowd worship cm punk look at the reaction
All tym fav 💥 love from India
Amazing the behind the scenes😮
I'm waiting for Dean Ambrose's Return 🍿❤️‍🔥
First i hrard this story now i have seen it
Thank you for making this ad free
I felt that anxiety of "THERE'S TWO CAGES". I'm so glad Punk clarified. "So get in the ring cages??" "NO NO. TWO SHARK CAGES. THE LIGHTING'S BETTER". There's so much on the go production that leads to the butterflies in chaos.
To quote mr. cole "I f*cking love pro wrestling".
Even cm punk was nervous of his return 😂😂
6:40 HELL FROZE OVER!
Heartwarming to see Punk, Stephanie, and HHH with all smiles and genuinely happy with each other's presence.
This moment will forever hold a place in my heart.  Took my son to Survivor Series for his first live show.  He specifically loves the moments when wrestlers make a return.  So, to get Randy and then Punk to close was just perfect.  Also, in the span of a few minutes, he went from a Punk hater to him being one of his faves. (He's a Cena fan and he holds a grudge...until he experiences a moment like this.)
The 😂 real backstage footage we been waiting for
Every time I see this, I think to myself AEW and the people who run it are IDIOTS!!
They never showed Seth Freakin Rollins hugging cm punk
CM PUNK TÚ APARICIÓN ME TRAJO RECUERDOS MUY LINDOS. TE 😊❤
The look on regal's face.. jeez! He ain't happy 😅
Great 👍💯💯
Regal's body language is insane in this video. He *does not* like him at all lol
This ladies and gentlemen is C and punk backstage footage that is actually worth watching versus what the other company tried to pull, when he wasn’t even there! Also, I would like to thank Mr. Tony Conn, for providing us with one of the best moments in the history of, your competition! For being stupid enough to let punk go, and now not being able to get more than 2000 people in a 20,000 seat building because you were dumb enough to let your Cash cow go, and provide us with one of the best years that we’ve had in pro wrestling since Steve Austin. Thank you Tony, for doing more for your competition than you ever did for your own promotion.
Randy so fing awesome lol
One of the biggest and best things HHH ever did after what this dude said on that podcast 😂
This is like seeing your family after many years at the family reunion...but it went well.
GTS🎉🎉🎉🎉
Randy being randy 😂😂😂
Bayley telling him to ‘bring her in’ - I know it’s the hug but his response makes me think it’s about AJ. 😭💕
What a moment🔥🔥
Bad boy personality
Please...Dean Ambrose return back again
Cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cm punk 4ever ❤🔥😘😘😘😘😘
Best. In the world... Is back
CM Punk best in the world documentary please?? 🙏🙏
cannot add more of adds? fokin idiots
Stephanie McMahon is existed in WWE❤
Best backstage moment❤
The best comeback is the comeback of Jimmy Uso ❤
Legendary moment..
Tony Khan feared for his life watching this video.
Punk Returning is Best For Business 😈😈😈😈😈
I would love nothing more to see what was seth and drew reactions when they came back and see him there in the back
Everyone that read behind the scenes.  Was hoping for Seth Rollins reaction behind the curtain
That was emotional 😭
In the Top10 greatest and loudest pops in wrestling history, 9 of those Top10 were made by CM Punk in Chicago in 2011, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 😅😅😅
why dom was aloof 😢
“ There was nowhere else to go.. so I came home! “ omg you can see how genuinely punk loves this place
Why the hell did i feel nervous watching the moments before his walkout when I already knew it happened?
Orton, Punk  19yrs ❤
If CM Punk can return to WWE the New York Knicks can win another NBA Championship.
Honestly, when the next Wrestlemania comes, Cena’s last match should be with CM Punk and Randy Orton. Three of them against whomever.
bro i thought we was gonna see at least something about seth 🤦‍♂️
Seth: 👀  Punk: 👁️👄👁️
Amateur Excrement Wrestling had Cody and Punk and sheet the bed in favour of the Adam Dud, Orange Clown and The Young Kucks
Damn, I still can feel the chills. I never thought that this gonna happen, but there he is! Good job WWE, good job Paul!
CM Punk being a excited for this was the joy I never knew I needed
At 0:04, the kid in the background's face is priceless
Still gives me goosebumps watching this after 1 year ❤
If you want to point to THE MOMENT where HHH truly moved the needle and redefined WWE for all time....THIS WAS THE MOMENT... JUST look at the backstage culture. Easily his Bischoff Hogan moment where The biggest free agent of the industry came BACK where truly The game took over 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾.
What😮😮 CM punk returned to WWE was in 2023.. Damn I'm getting extremely old too..👴🏿👴🏿👴🏿
Hitting the anniversary 🎉
3:30 Papa H 😂😂
Doot  doot Doot
Gold bureg an cm return iss greatest of all time
This doesn’t beat edge’s return though 😁
0:42 that's come a long way since "I know where that hand's been".
His popped in AEW was WAY LOUDER👌👌
A man of the people! What an amazing return!!!
05:56 CM Punk reaction comes from heart❤
It truly was meant to be ❤
0:03 the security guard in the back 😂😂😂. That was all of us
i need this kind of documentary when AJ is returning at the rumble or Wrestlemania ❤
7:25 that Chicago pop gives me goosebumps every time!
Wwe/youtube. Please add subtitles/close captions since I’m deaf and I’m sure deaf community would love to have subtitles on this video and more videos.
7:48 Cm punk return after while in her home town see the fans sound the real goosebumps auraa🥵💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
It makes me happy to see Punk so happy to come back to WWE. He always wanted to go to WWE when he was on the indies and he didn't want to leave, but he had to for his mental and physical health.
Where was seth
even a year later, still more relevant than the company he came from, hilarious
Triple H knows very well, what is best for business😂😂😂😂😂
Stephanie was there~~~~
Another Backstage footage with cm Punk😁😁
This is surreal man
what aew didnt do with punk vs omega. yriple h thought the cm punk vs seth rollins rivalry will out do that. we are patiently waiting hunter❤
Randy is on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else notice Punk chatting to Becky Lynch? It's a bit dark but it's definitely her, so interesting considering the beef between him and Rollins
Man! wish we could see Seth's reaction
The best part about the clip for me was Sami and Corey graves welcoming him back even though they had issues with Punk. Both talked it out with him and are cool now. The professionalism to keep personal problems aside is impeccable. Most of that locker room did it. Roman Seth Drew are great examples too. Punk also matured with all his bust ups over the years and made peace with a lot of people. Great for wrestling fans.
Im nervous just watching this.
0:44 Stephanie McMahon looks ❤
Did they sneak Seth out that back door ?😂😂
What about Seth Rollins
Me Smiling the whole video lmao  I love this
Wholesome.
stu face revealed
I m addicted to watch this
Still can’t believe he’s been back a year,so cool and hope we can see a future title run😳👀
2:50
I’m just a chill guy watching backstage footage of cm punks return
Just Remember CM always Punks Out!!!!
greatest return of all time
Amazing. Thank you Perry and Tony Khan. Have fun with the Costco guys! 🤣💀
Same Scenario In Survivor Series 2024 Men's War Game Match End And Music Hits Beast Incarnet Brock Lesner 👿 Return Canada Crowd bursting 🤩 Pray For This 🛐🔜
I was waiting to see a shot of Drew and Seth pissed off at him! 😭
He's HOME!
0:42 Now I know where the hands has been 😮
thankyou AEW :))
GOOD VIDEO
I didn't even know that Survivor Series was held at Chicago, Illinois.
Love to see rollins getting mad😂😂
Greatrest moment in Wrestling History
One of the best bts video!!!!!!!!
Thank you for uploaded it. Forever, Together🤝
post Roman Reigns return summerslam
Weird seeing Punk abit nervous
That's why we love Wrestling. Everything is possible ! Every dream can be true !
best in the world for a reason baby
We want See Brock lesbar
What exactly does Michael Hayes actually contribute 😅😅😅
i still get goosebumps everytime i still cant belive it happend
Thank You Jack Perry
The best thing ever happened in pro wrestling ❤
Doot doot doot.
CM is going to kill the New Bloodline at Survivor Series 🔥🔥🔥
I wanna see Seth reaction in the back 😂
I been waiting for this....took this long for them to upload...it's worth it though
Impressive. Very nice.  Let's see Seth Rollins' reaction
Hell yeah dude, Punk and Kofi was all I needed. His road wife as he called him back in the day. I would love at least one more tag team match!
Why didn’t they show when Rollins came backstage?? Smh
And this is the guy they say is toxic and a bad presence in the locker room? ok Tony buddy
6:20 did somebody say “Cole’s gay” 😭😭😭
Bailey so fine
There is my 2023 best moment the messiah of straight edge society ❤❤❤
I still can’t believe that he’s back
How do you get a job like this?  Triple H call the shots! 💯🔥
Wwe hide this fotage from us for 1 year😢
Wwe shoing aew backstage work
Looking back, this could’ve been even more amazing if trips had gone out with him or a few seconds after
Looking for SETH ....😊😊😊😊
It's still incredible that after simply one promo over 13 years ago, CM Punk became a literal god in the business. His Hall of Fame induction is gonna be something special
I think cm Punk is best in the world 🌎 😮
All love
CM would be good choice for wolverine
2:25 Bobby!
This is just the best thing ever
AEW drops backstage footage of punk throwing punches, WWE drops backstage footage of punk hugging everyone in the company
The Best Moment In My Life 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I wish they could have brought back This Fire Burns one more time. That Money in the Bank 2011 entrance is still my favorite entrance of Punk's and that song by Killswitch Engage is killer. Cant complain with Living Color's Cult of Personality.
Where is roman reigns summer slam 2024
Was the whole thing with Seth Rollins real? I heard he hates punk
One of the coolest moments in the history of the industry and for so many reasons
3:17 Bayley fangirling 💯💯💯
If you told me in 2011 or 14 that CM Punk would be taking creative instructions from Triple H, I would have been like, "No way." Well here we are. What a moment for the wrestling business.
Orton is the GOAT man…..the way he handled the situation…..he is truly the GOAT
Ufc, Phil, Ufc
Seeing Corey Graves and Punk interact was my highlight <3
i got nothing but respect more to the wwe creation making cm punk returns to wwe
i felt the same thing what randy said to punk. let randy enjoy some quality time after his return. but WWE has more surprises for us. man.
where is seth
Best since day one
That pop of this return was crazy 🔥🔥
This really made me appreciate Bayley even more than i already did which was a ton. National treasures. Punks my all time fave. Sticks to his morals, stands up for himself, and he keeps it real. He is the best at blending fiction and reality
This guy is getting wwe record-breaking views, and his only wrestled 5 matches true aura
When punk met their old fellows Triple H,Randy,Regal and Kofi ❤❤
Awkward no eye contact handshake with Regal there. Haha
❤
We need a 24 documentary surrounding his return
4:05   this is a crime to see CM Punk and Triple H hugging and smiling with each other..
Cm punk is in the building ❤
So much healing happened here
Damn🤍
This is the day hell froze over! WOW!
I wonder if Becky was upset that baley said The best about cm punk right next to her if anyone noticed..maybe It's nothing tho
They should run a couple more ads during this 9 minute video…

I love these backstage videos man
Thank you Jungle boy 🙏
they should do this the same with the wyatt sicks debut
02:42 Big time Becks
I wanted to see the interaction with Seth Rollins.😅
6:23 Stu, like THE cameraman Stu?! If it's him, it's the first time I'm seeing him off-camera 😁
No Seth Rollins coming through that curtain? I guess he really does hate him, and it's not just wrestling Twitter talk.
Aww that Kofi & CM Punk hug 🥹
All these ads
He looks so happy to be back home.
Seth is ooc mad at punk
This needs a subtitle. i want to hear what cm punk asked triple H.  Also, where is Seth? So his outrage was real?
5:43 Jamie Noble !!!!!! YEET
idgaf how great wrestling was in the 90s/00s... what Triple H has done so far is FAR beyond anything I expected to be possible and wrestling really feels like it's the best it has been in decades. This kind of content is something I could watch NONSTOP, keep the train rollin!
1 year and a day ago. Last time i cried so loud. CM PUNK!
This is the love he deserves. From everyone regardless. Punk is Punk. Was great seeing this side of things on the return
Hello, Humans One laugh a day keeps the bs away.  TERRANCE OUT
Rhea is delighted he's here. ❤
😮
One of the biggest pops in a long long time for someone 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼.
Fire the barber
a great video! just one thing wrong with it...  A Nine Minute, Thirty Second Video, documenting a blockbuster moment and return in WWE History, almost RUINED by five, yes, FIVE advert breaks, getting to see the interactions backstage Punk hugging friends not seen for a while, posing for the pics, good stuff - have an advert by all means, about half way through. Twice in this time period  - maybe a little over the top, but FIVE??? Going to certain extremes, and that's putting things very politely, SORT IT OUT WWE/Youtube
Thank you HHH 🙏
To see them all hugging and welc9ming him back was humble
Ive been watching Cm Punk since i was a kid lot of memories
Only thing missing was Seth's reaction and getting him to calm down in the back lmao
Randy and Punks interaction was 10/10, two veterans busting each others chops
Where is Seth Rollins? :)
Dream come true❤
bro came back had a banger feud over the year and left without saying anything
As good as the bloodline story has been this is still peak WWE the last 3 yrs.
That’s amazing they have released this footage
We got CM Punk return to WWE before GTA 6
I need another 2 hours of him just meeting and reuniting with people backstage
Paul with the best line of the whole thing. "Phil - wanna put out a picture of me and you and blow up the internet?"
Wish we could see seths reaction, followed with hugs
Seth Rollins going to turn heel. CM Punk and Roman Reigns are the two people he hates most together, teaming up and in the same match. He will get involved and turn heel. I’m calling it
Damn what a moment... really special❤
I wish  punk came back when Kurt Angle was running Raw
Goosebumps from head to toe.
Punk should keep the shorter hair, it looks a lot better than his old man look he's sporting now
still get  goosebumps
CM PUNK Always Moves The Needle  The Best In The World
so the Seth & Punk beef is real
🔥cm punk🔥
was that bobby roode @2:26
My Favorite Wrestler Reason I still watch Wrestling till this day CM Punk The Best in the World Thank You for answering my prayers and returning
Love this
Oww thought they were going to lift the curtain and show Drew and Seth hugging it out. Guess you gotta keep kayfabe alive a bit still huh
This proves that what Punk said about his return to WWE was in fact REAL and FACTUAL. I really really hope that people stop giving him as much slap around for past occurences and lets punk be able to enjoy himself with the rest of his career and the rest of his time in wrestling as a whole. He is happy to be back and working with everyone that he has been as it makes money but he also makes box office validations regarding storylines and matches. Yes he has had a rocky road but enjoy the ride, as this is going to be peak punk time.
Bro, I still get goosebumps even a year later from this.
It is still Unreal
this moment still gives me chills and goosebumps!! THE RETURN OF CM PUNK is one of the best moments of Survivor Series, 2023 and DECADE!!
Best comeback in wrestling history ❤
did seth nor drew pass through gorilla?
This is awesome
CM Punk kind of looks like T-Bag from Prison Break especially when he smiles
Randy and Punk.
Notice how in this video there is no seth rollins, His reaction when he heard punks music was legit
No behind the scenes with Seth Rollins? You guys really want to paint their beef with a shroud of mystery huh? lol
This was super cool real talk
It’s so good. I love getting to see these real moments and emotions
I love Bayley. And totally forgot Randy returned off the top of my head😹
Please Bring back Deam Ambrose❤
Serh Rollins was nowhere to be swen in the backstage lmao.
Epic!
Just beautiful ❤️
This is what class looks like!!!   AEW , watch and learn.
Greatest return in WWE History. 🍿
Was that William Regal in gorilla??
and just think tony khan let this mega star go dumbest mistake he ever made
Beaming from ear to ear 😊
The fact they didn’t show any sort of backstage interaction between Punk and Rollins is funny. There’s no way they didn’t at least run into each other with the rest of that survivor series team
I don't know why but no matter how many times I watch that Survivor Series moment I cry. It's like I'm dreaming, as if I was back in 2014 when all I could do was hope that Punk would return then this happened, for real!
It’s crazy how all this lined up Vince getting kicked out triple H taking over bringing CM punk back to WWE in his home town and cooking with a lot of storylines.
Please WWE more videos like this! Love seeing backstage reactions eccetra
This is the wholesome content I am here for
Left the WWE in a way no one should be able to or want to come back, came back with probably the biggest pops imaginable, had one of the best rivalries in modern WWE and had one of the best hell in a cell matches in WWE history. God damn CM Punk is something else.
It’s about time this came out!!
Love the behind the scenes stuff. Makes you feel part of the company, somehow.
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
Love punk abd kofi embrace
Drew doesn’t actually hate Punk.   Seth at least did, I don’t know if he still does.
Rollins is so turing heel and taking out punk in war games this year
Dakota kai Sighting 😍
we need a girl that looks us the way Bayley watch CM punk
what if for 2024 after the women's war games match we hear light it up
Good seeing you HERE!
I got to see CM PUNK two months before at wembley and i went mainly to go see him, that was as close to mania ill ever get... then CM PUNK COME HOME! I WAS SO HYPED SAT IN MY ROOM! 10 YEARS I WAITED FOR THAT! Seeing him for first time ever at wembley was the best but seeing that return... man that's wrestling <3
Where's Seth ?
lol I wanted that Seth backstage interaction so bad
Thank you triple H
CHICAGO!!!! CHICAGO!!!! CHICAGO!!!!
Grand Entrance! 🎉
John Cena's Stew everyone 6:23
Were Seth Rollins got angry.
6:55 when you meet your old friend after a long time.
1:27 that headset over the the hat tho... 😂😂
CM Punk Is Truly A Legendary Icon Of The World!!⚡️⚡️🌎🌎🙏🙏💎💎❤️❤️🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Big Respect for CM Punk 🔥💎💯 👏👏👏
Cm Punk is great! As long as he never enters an octagon again...
I love when wwe lunch backstage video to public
Based on the hell in a cell match he had... this was the correct choice.
The day that turned Rollins salty forever lol
Thank you, Nick Khan!
I was literally smiling ear to ear this whole segment the kid in me came out frfr Cm Punk is legendary and this segment proves it and I'm happy he's back and he's happy 🫶🏼💯💯
NICE BEHIND THE SCENES OF CM PUNK'S WWE RETURN ATE SURVIVOR SERIES 2023 LAST YEAR !!!!
You had doubts hunter? There was no chance it wont gonna get crazy
Purposely cut Seth Rollins to make us believe they didn't hug it out backstage huh?
This video is a piece of art
Who was waiting for seth rollins? 😂
where's Seth 😂
It's been a year but it still gives me chills everytime I watch it
The one interaction i really want to see is not in this clip... Is it bcos there is no interaction cos they areange it so both of them won't meet at the gorilla or is there any other reason.. i will never know straight form their own statement..
Seth Rollins not come to meet cm punk
🩵🩵🩵
Punk and Edge have the biggest return pops ever!
Hola a él Señor Triple H a la esposa y a todos los que comandan la WWE Gracias por regalarnos a nosotros los fanáticos de la wwe por permitirnos ver todas las luchas y las exclusividades del show feliz noche
4:45 😅😅 Punk telling HHH " We will TALK= lots and lots of 💰 💰💰💰 for CM! 😅😅😅
Big slap to those AEW kids who couldn’t be professional and put their personal feelings aside.  WWE and CM Punk are growing and moving forward, while they’re just moving backwards and becoming worse and worse.
CM punk is such a loser,  WWE thinks this will make us cheer for him?? LOL    NO.   The harder you push,  the more he will be treated like Roman pre heel turn.
saludos desde argentina

Punk didnt look too pleased seeing Micheal Hayes! 😅😅😅😅🥴😳🤭
gvb gvbhnj
Regal none too pleased
Randy Orton ❤❤❤❤❤
2:56 if you dont feel that ROAR in your heart idk if its beating then, HOLY $h!T
As a totally blind fan, WWE needs to be more inclusive and put audio description tracks on stuff like this because all I’m getting is Michael Cole and Corey Graves, which I’ve already heard because this was my favorite return maybe of all time in history and I lived through Steve Austin.
Where are Seth Rollins and drew McIntyre 🤔🤔🤔
Gotta be the loudest pop in WWE
You just had to be there in person. This was surreal!
As an 08 WWE kid seeing kofi and cm punk reunite was really awesome
Disappointing Bayley hug.
I actually love all this bts stuff, I feel like I’m in a cool club or something😂 my inner child is just so happy to see a little bit of the inside of the business I grew up loving so much😭 Edit: the Randy Orton part, these guys are just dudes fr bro😂
Wasn't he a cancer? I thought we was a problem for any company
Lokey ik it’s long term story telling but I feel they cut Seth’s part out of them hugging
Punks a joke
Cool to see behind the scenes, a look behind the curtain!
Seeing this moment after a year, yup. This has been TRENDING in the Philippines. Filipino Wrestling fans simply loves CM PUNK!
There are few things in wrestling that go off quite like Cm Punk coming out to a Chicago crowd. AEW. WWE. Doesn't matter. That's just a thing.
This is the stuff I love from WWE.  The stuff behind the curtain and so much more.  I really love the wrestling business.  Congrats to everyone from the bottom to the top, you guys really knocked it out of the park and continue to do so as of writing this comment.
I know Seth Rollins didn't go backstage
Man I still got goosebumps when his music hit.
Now show the part you cut of Punk shaking hands with Drew and Rollins.
i never realized how chaotic the backstage is. And they do this 2 a week in different locations in a year.
series😂
That was the last thing I watched with my dad 1 year ago today with my dad was CM Coming back to wwe every time I see CM Punk now I think of my dad
I also want to see roman reign and cody rhodes return like this
“Looks like Hell froze over.” I remember yelling for my brother to come down because he didn’t believe that he was back. Hell really did freeze over.
Them including the return at the end is the best thing too 🐐
bruce pichard =vince mcmahons  renfield. he knows ALL the secrets about vince, like the  homosexual pedophile=pat patterson did. pat was a high mason and so is bruce  get lost fragile phil. stay away. too toxic for aew. too broken down for wwe
6:56 I've got so many laughs on Randy's reaction. He's the best.
Thank you Tony Khan😂😂😂😂 in ten years time the most important AEW match will have been Punk vs Perry 😂😂😂😂
this was beautiful
We all can't thank jack perry enough 😂
El mejor video que he visto en mi vida
Randy :- i m all sweat buddy Punk :- i don't care buddy 😂
4:06 hunter really hugged him after that "mine went straight to DVD just like yours" 😂
There have been a lot of bad main events on raw. Hopefully better on Netflix or I won't watch.
They were like parents on Christmas Eve setting up the best present for the WWE Universe
Seeing Punk and Dom Dom man  I still remember the Happy Birthday song
I wouldn't trust cm punk. He's like a cobra snake he'll turn on you quick  be careful " roman" punk and wiseman out to get you bro.
Not a huge fan of behind the curtain stuff, but things like this are freaking awesome. Still gives me goosebumps when the 2nd City Saint returned home
You can see the genuine heat between Punk and Michael Hayes
Randy is an a-hole...and I love him so much for that!😂😂😂
Beautiful
He did namaste to whom ? 00:37
2 HOUR VERSION PLEASE 🙏🏾
it's good to see stefanie again, even if it is backstage.... can't believe it's been a year since punk's return. seems a lot shorter than that. probably becaue he's been fighting just drew for half the year.
Randy Orton 😂😂
Happy Punk = Healthy Punk = Younger looking Punk = $$$
❤☕
00.03 thats security girls shock when see cm punk
Launch button 🚀 from triple H 😉 2:53
This will be... Hands down, The Greatest WWE return ever made. Nothing can top this.
1:09 This is a nice view. Two elite veterans who left WWE, then came back in 2023.
What I noticed most is how they treated Punk backstage, particularly Steph and HHH.   Everyone has grown and matured.  This video is awesome.   Time heals.   Vince being gone doesn't hurt
We gather here today to thank Tony Khan for being a Horrible Businessman and who made this possible
i want randy orton 2023 survivor series return backstage clips!
Still gives you goosebumps. ❤ X
worst part of the show..and to much time devoted to clips on him on RAW
cm punk! cm punk!
They should ban cell phones, if fans wanna be hype let’s go old school where fans back then didn’t have cell phones on them.
All fuking fake…
Who's smiling watching this?
Thank you Tony Klown for giving us the best return of the decade.
Hhh 🔥 CM punk 😈
Bayley Cake 3:16
Love that CM Punk is back home where he belongs. It’s surreal to see him back. Ty HHH
When will WWE treat CM the way he deserves it's been a year already, atleast give him a good rivalry after Drew😭😭
You can tell there was no need for the "hairdryer pop" when Cult of Personality came on. That was au naturel.
Punk is like Linkin Park, he's not the biggest name in the industry still got a strong and loyal fanbase! 💪🏻😎
Anyone else noticed that interaction with Cory graves how punks face went from really happy to just flat after Cory walk off
If AEW Is known for 3 things It'll be   1 Creating a change in wrestling not seen since the 90s  2 it forces WWE to change their booking style  And 3 It was a catalyst for Bringing Punk Back
This was lovely!
"Wanna put a picture of me and you and blow up the Internet?" Crazy to think how Punk and HHH getting this chummy was unthinkable only a year ago, lol.
Saint lucia always look at u guys Caribbean people
Thank You Triple H !
Hahaha Michael Hayes looks like a Kentucky Fried Pimp😂😂😂😂
7:23
CHICAGO, CHICAGO, CHICAGO, CHICAGO,-😂😂😂
Anyone else notice becky in the background clearly not happy about this
the only one that didn’t talk to him in the back was Seth Rollins
No seth lmao
He must have been nervous as hell.
Nameste 0:36
Strange how WWE keeps perpetuating these preposterous storylines and then shows the reality of everyone actually being friends with behind the scenes.
"I'm just a dude disguised as a dude playing another dude." - CM Punk 2024ish
The best PPV last 2023 with a pop!!!!
No one is talking about how Punk is clearly nervous 😅
Punk look happy😂😂😂
Biggest comeback ever🔥🔥
Cm punk is such an average looking human but he is so goddamn special
our girl Shotzi, admiring the moments.
I felt like a 10-year-old boy again when I saw this, it is a beautiful moment and something unforgettable for some it is just the return of Punk, but for me I relive my childhood🤧
Please release backstage video of Roman Reings SummerSlam Return please ☝
I’m still emotional over this a year later. I love this man 😭
It still doesn’t feel real
Bro 6 ads in a 9 minute video is absolutely crazy lol
Backstage people are hiding something I felt😮
When Dom shook Cm Punk hand you could see the young face of dom and rey when they were a tag team.
0:30 Amazing how he's right there in a "room" with all those big executive names that had beef with him lmao
Like plan b Triple h attack behind 😂😂
the cut out the parts where Seth and Drew come backstage and welcome him back by shaking his hand
Stephanie McMahon slap to cm punk 😂😂
I can feel cm punk feels😢
CM Punk, CM Punk, CM Punk
Bruce looks super happy lol.
Cm punk is the best rapper of all time.
My man still out there doing his thing
JURO QUE LO AMO LO AMO LO AMO ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ CM UFFFF PERO AMO MAS A MI HHH KING OF KINGS FOREVER ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wasnt cm punk Injured
For someone so hated. He got a pretty warm welcome home.
Because that song adds so much to the punk atmosphere and this particular occasion, someone should give Living Colour their flowers.
That dude yelling chicago XD
El Mejor regreso del 2023,sin dudas el Triple Jentai se la ha rifado con todo lo que nos ha dado ❤🎉
YESSSS
Becky lynch ignore 😂
Is that Ashante Thee Adonis working backstage?
This was awesome.
AEW died this day...
Orton :I almost sweaty Punk: I don't care brother ❤
The funny thing is that becky lynch is very excited and happy to see cm punk unlike her husband seth rollins 😆
still goosebumps
Every CM Punk video always gets over 1mil views within days.. This is what a superstar is ladies & gentleman. Let’s not forget which company dropped the ball
Regal and Punk wanted to laugh so hard since they know they left that clown show
This is awesome!
2:17 😏
I love this mannnnn
2:26 GLORIOUSSS! I WONT GIVE I WONT GIVE IN, TILL IM VICTORIOUS
"And then, I told CM Punk to come back to WWE and appear at Survivor Series after the last match" -Rock
BEST DAY IN THE WORLD BABAY
In all seriousness, CM Punk needs to go back to this faded hair style. It fits him amazingly well!!!!
All hail that doofus son in law🙌🙌
Not meet Seth?
Chicago Legend ✔️
This is best seen happen in wwe
I F'ING love these behind the scenes vids!
He’s not called the second saint for no reason! We got a second chance at PUNK!
Really appreciate WWE posting these backstage clips
Literally nobody cared for Randy returning from career ending injury . Thus is heartbreaking .😢 Wwe should be ashamed of themselves
Freaking amazing!
Papa H i love u man! So glad they made this❤
No matter how big this company gets, there's so many things here in the back that are the same no matter what wrestling show you work, and I love it.
The ending there Randy made me laugh 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not gonna show Seth? lol
Triple H actually does what is good for business. This was incredible 🎉
Chicago Chicago Chicago 😂
This BTS is fearing my life.
Punk and Kofi still besties
Freaking Awesome!
9 and a half minute video and I gave up when it went fir it's 6th advert break! That's just pure greed...
Crazy to believe regal and cm punk was working for the other company a year ago
its true punk said this is how it went word for word in a interview he did
CM Punk coming back is like Jamie Tartt returning to AFC Richmond.
They cut the scene on Seth coming backstage damn ....
Prime example of “you never burn bridges with certain people in life”
Triple H is the man!!!
Truly in the HOF of Wrestling returns
Punk saying, "Hey, good seeing you!" to Cody is just fantastic. Thanks, Tony!
better backstage footage than the one from the other company
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM, PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK..ALL NIGHT LONG
That hug with Kofi was special. You felt the energy. You could tell there’s a lot of love between Kofi and Punk. I’m so glad they posted this behind the scenes!
0:00 yep the lady's reaction summed it up
CM Punk seeing Dominick all grown up... Awkward 😅
Worth watching
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was beautiful
Imagine how the fans felt being there live especially where punk came out by the entrance ramp.
CM PUNK :There is nowhere else to go HHH: hahahah
Am I The Only One Who Can't Stand CM Punk?
They had to wait a full year to upload this, to make sure he was still with the company. If he'd quit/was fired in weeks (as many "prophesized") this would have been embarrassing, and all over the internet, like all those photos/videos of him hugging Tony Khan and with his arm around Jack Perry...
Seth didn't welcome him in backstage 😆
Is that Cedric Alexander?
Ashante Adonis working backstage?
Best part was the long term story telling of having Drew storm off and Seth be besides himself.
So THAT'S Stu~
Cody & Punk hey good seeing you here 😂 both of them back in WWE
Then there’s Seth and Drew absolutely fuming by ringside at his return
I would like to thank you Tony Clown and Jungle Boy for making this happen.
Ver juntos a CM Punk y William Regal, me trae buenos recuerdos del hermoso año 2008. 🥲👍
They're only discussing where Punk should be a minute before he goes out. Haha. So awesome~
This is awesome
You can tell punk is truly happy and humbled to be back. What a return!
this is the moment that brought me back to wrestling  i was a huge cm punk/wwe fan back in 2013. was watching weekly back then and went to Wrestlemania 31 & 32. Also went to Royal Rumble 2015 and tons of other events like the black and gold era NXT TakeOver Dallas & TakeOver Brooklyn.  i stopped watching weekly around 2017, then completely stopped around 2019 and even stopped tuning into the manias. product was so trash it was just unbearable it left a bad taste in my mouth. legit didn't watch wrestlemania 39 or some of the others before i had almost kind of forgot i was such a huge fan.  last year i heard CM punk came back to WWE so decided to check out the return on youtube and completely marked out for the first time in 5+ years. [i ignored his AEW run]  been watching weekly ever since.  caught up on the bloodline and kinda salty i missed out seeing that playout live.  now i am going to Rumble 2024. Also checked out CM Punk at the garden & been to Smackdowns/Raws & going to Saturday night's main event.  all this to say - CM punk is def a draw. stoked to be a mark again
My biggest problem with CM Punks return was that it totally hijacked Randys return... But seeing Randys reaction behind the scenes, I'm ok with it all now.
Vince would have never let this happen
i’m gonna get the pointing picture? PUNK ACKNOWLEDGES THE HUNTER POINT
Bto when that music hit I fell on to my knees and covered my nose and mouth in shock
Mix Match challenge... Punk & Bayley
I wanna see the Mania one, where Punk met up back with Rock, Cena and Taker
If I could bottle up my reaction to him returning a year ago, I would never be capable of sadness again. I was so so so so very happy! I truly felt like I was floating. CM Punk is my guy - always will be. So glad he's back because wrestling just isn't wrestling without him <3
It's my question...where is seth  😂😂😂
Kofi Kingston long time friend to C.M Punk ❤️❤️❤️ The emotions.
Greatest return in WWE ever. Hands down
Later, we need to see Seth's reaction once he comes back. We need to see the keyfabe interaction.
Talk about Goosebumps 👏🏼
what a year for cm punk ❤
So awesome to see the behind the scenes come to life on screen once they come out thru the curtains/ gorilla
Awesome
one of the GOAT and one of the greatest returns ever!!!
Dom with the flashbacks
One year after we are having Punk inside war games!👹🔥
Dont forget to thank AEW for letting Punk do a rehearse and warmup before he officially return in WWE 😂
And this past year, punk has helped make WWE so enjoyable with his grudge with McIntire. Great year
Cm punk! ❤
I'M 38 YEARS OLD AND THIS WAS MAKING ME TEAR UP LIKE A BABY CHILD 😂😂
6:58  The G.O.A.T.S
the goat is back!!!!!
Tony Khan: 🙃
Looking like a movie acene
I shed a tear
This is amazing footage
lmao "Are you gonna point at me?" 😂😂😂
i know it was all in good fun but.... i want to see a Randy/Punk storyline where he actually does get mad about this
5:26 I’m pretty sure that word “good seeing you” have a little AEW reference in that😂 It kinda have an exclamation point the way they said it😂
Don’t know if this moment will ever be topped. Amazing❤
No no no, that's simply not ENOUGH, WWE. WE NEED TO SEE MORE. FROM THE TIME HE WOKE UP THAT DAY TO THE TIME HE WENT TO BED!
I wonder where Seth Rollins was cause I didn’t see him lol
6:55 you can tell that Randy and Punk are great friends because instead of congratulating him and welcoming him back, the first words Randy says to him are, “Hey, ya motherf**ker” (I’m assuming that’s what he said) and then proceeds to jokingly get upset over Punk interrupting HIS return
For the first time since 2014, CM Punk makes his surprise return to WWE at the 37th Annual Survivor Series in Chicago, Ill. for months after Spain conquered the world in Australia & New Zealand at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup - 11/25/2023
Couldn’t hear the music for the screams in there. What a moment.
OK, I have to admit after seeing this one more time it’s still brings tears to my eyes
The cold shoulder to Michael hays
Tony Khan to Jack Perry: This is all your fault!!!!
trips knew whats best for business
I get goosebumps everytime I see his return..
This is too much of a peak behind the curtain lol
Thank you Jack Perry. Thank you Tony Khan. Thank you All Elite Wrestling.
Regal and Punk are on the outs huh?
Smart of them to cut out Seth Rollins welcoming him back to keep kayfabe going
Tyson vs Paul. Fake. Drew vs CM Bunny. Fake.
Addicted!!!!!!!!! This was definitely the biggest returns of all time.
Love these backstage segments
bro him and regal had barely any interaction 😂
Third time since survivor series last year injury prone youre story lines suck😮
Honestly I remember all the hype and speculations of CM Punk coming back. Past me never thought it would happen. I remember freaking out in excitement when I heard the theme! I was already excited when Randy came back and having CM Punk return too was a great surprise! He got me personally invested  in WWE and wrestling as a whole. I already liked watching it with my family and friends but when you came around I suddenly had a favorite wrestler!
Hunter: you want to do a internet thing? Punk: you going to point at me?
6:55 Randy & Punk moment its so hilarious🤣
There best pipebomb trash talker in wwe cm punk
I wish you could add YouTube video's to favorites without playlists
BEST POP EVER !!!!!
He should've came out of a box. Because anyone who comes out of a box is f***ing over... Motherf***er!
4:40 War Pigs 🤘
Not showing Seth's reaction backstage confirms main event WM41
It wasn't Punk and Hunter. It was Phil and Paul right there. Damn dude. That was a great watch..
THE CROWD GOES WILD WHEN CM PUNK RETURNS AT SURVIVOR SERIES (FREAKIN AWESOME)
Why does Michael Hayes dress like a barbershop quartet had a bake sale
Everyone but seth ahahaha
5:47 the face of Dom we rarely get to see.
Regal at Gorilla!
2:55
Ok where should i begin? I remember that Royal Rumble Kane Elimination, i remember hearing rumours of him walking out, i saw that chris van interview the "never ever ever" still googled his name every week for 3 years in hopes it all proves to be a work. It wasn't. As years went on the google search became less hopeful and less frequent. Until one day, all fell into place, as he was about to make his All indi wrestling debut, and I watched it live on my screen, sitting thousands of miles away in Pakistan with a big smile, knowing the actual forbidden door is back open again, and that this return is now only going to pave the way for his return "back home" eventually. I didn't hope this time, i knew it will happen. The last contract he had there was rumoured to be 4 years, i was willing to wait for 4. Thank you Tony lol. CM Punk CM Punk CM Punk!
unexpected return and we enjoyed it very much
I just love seeing wrestlers whether there heels or faces showing their gratitude towards one another
Compared to what he said in a previous interview about what the situation was here before this video came out, it's exactly SPOT ON. Makes this video that much better (and wonder how much more believable his side of All Out is bc of this now)
El mejor regreso de todos los tiempos.
Now hes in biggest storyline in wrestling thats not the title
It's not complete without Punk in Chicago.
Hunter looking through the curtains reminded me of McMahon looking back at Bischoff just before he went backstage when Bischoff debuted on RAW.
That night was amazing, I literally couldn't sleep after this. It was like I was being transported back to when I was 14. I remember the whole night thinking he would come back to the Wargames match, but then it didn't happen so I accepted he would not come back that night, until the match ended. Holy sh*t I was so pumped. I agree when Punk said that it was the peak moment of his career. It was 10 years in the making. Nothing surpassed my excitement for this, not even WM40 ending, even though that was insane too. It just brought back so many memories. 2012 was the first year I was able to watch WWE live on a regular basis and Punk was always there. To me this will always be my favorite moment in wrestling history, cause I've lived through all of this. I've lived these 10 years of waiting for CM Punk to make amends with wrestling and then with the WWE itself. I've seen all his journey post WWE, I got some comics from his time working with Marvel, I've seen him get beaten down in UFC, even though I dont like MMA, I enjoyed a little bit of his time in AEW, but it never felt right. What I wanted all along was him on WWE. I knew it would happen someday, but It happened a lot earlier than expected.
This is how you showcase your stars. When Punk came back a lot of people were hating and doubting him. But its so clear from this footage and other footage WWE shows, that a lot of people in the buissness really like him. And WWE really showcases this with videos like that. It's obvious they don't want people to believe that he is an angry hateful man.
Just goes to show vince was dead wrong about a lot of things within the past 10 years
I could tell they could interact when they did the ring segment when they were on strike
Randy orton: you ruined my moment!!  Cm punk: i had to do it  😂😂
i was there in Chicago
ICONIC
There're 3 men I want to thank for their work during the last 10 years: Gedo for making New Japan an awesome alternative wrestling product, Tony Khan for creating a second major North American promotion to make things interesting again, and Triple H for giving us The Renaissance of WWE.
I'm sorry. But if Bayley loves you. You're a good person and Bayley loves Punk. They are great friends. The elite are the problem. Not punk.
This is the stuff we love to see! We all know it’s a show… it’s the behind the scenes stuff (the humans) we care about. Would love to see more of this type of content!
Aww, they didn't show Seth giving him a big hug!
LA Knight!!!!!!!!!!  Yeah!
And people we're saying "Punk is toxic. Nobody wants him back in the locker room. He's trouble." I don't know looks different to me😆
Someone give Living Colour their flowers b/c that song adds SO MUCH to Punk’s aura & this moment in particular.
I STILL get goosebumps watching his return. I watched it last night with everyone's reactions. What a moment and I'm not even a big Punk fan either.
Punk tried to kiss me omg
I bet the atmosphere of this return will never be beaten for Punk and I also bet you would never feel this level of atmosphere anywhere in another production
Where did Seth go?
Just fantastic, growing up watching so many of these guys destroy their bodies for our entertainment I'm just glad that Punk and HHH and HBK and so many others are doing well and mending bridges. Just making WWE as good as it can possibly be.
7:25 the most historic return in history
Thank you Jack Perry, Tony Khan, Hangman, Young Bucks, and AEW for making this happen. Most importantly thank you real glass, couldn't have happened without it!
1yr later, Punk is in War Games! in Vancouver!!! can't wait to see it Live!
See all of that just acting not real
I’m so glad CM Punk is back in WWE! I hope we get a new CM Punk documentary
The best in the world 🌍❤️
This healed me
They always come crawling back don’t they?😊 From Bret to double j to cm punk… Cm punk u corporate ahss kisser u..😂 Papa H sonned u and put his armed around u like a chest pawn. U had no allies so u had to go beg for u job back and play nice little boy. Look at u all nervous . “ will they accept me?” Wwe always wins i love it 😂
WHERE'S SETH ROLLINS
I am here for Orton's reaction and it was the best.
i could watch this over and over again one of the best returns/comeback in the last 20 years or maybe more hes a living legend PIPEBOMB!!!
best in the world 💙💙💙💙
These behind-the-scenes videos capture something special: the raw, authentic emotions of everyone involved.
The ultimate Never Say Never.
I can watch this all day. The day hell froze over.
Just awesome. Randy’s reaction was the best
I got the impression that Stephanie wasn't so happy about it.
lets go F AEW
This is soooo wholesome to see 💯❤
Who else watched this hoping to see Rollins reaction as he came through the curtain
the woman's face in the doorway in the opening seconds said it all
Survivor Series 2023 was the first time watching WWE in over 15 year, I've been hooked ever since that night.
I think WWE just set the world record for the most youtube ads in a 9 and a half minute video.  10 separate commercial breaks unbelievable!
Biggest crowd pop in the history of WWE.
ONlY RANDY'S PART😂
The pop when cm punk returned. I can’t wait for Jon Moxley to returned
Crazy how this was one year ago
Didn’t punk refuse to shake Regals hand in AEW as he was “WWE stooge”  lol 😂
Maturity is a helluva thing. Softens all the hard edges of resentment.
THEYRE GONNA DO THIS WHEN BROCK COMES BACK THIS SATURDAY
The idiotic daughter and the dufus Son in law 😂
I remember screaming my head off when I heard the static , to me this is the greatest return of ALL time in WWE. It was pure Magic!!! CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
I noticed they didn't show Seth backstage. 🤔🤔🤔
Punk handshaking Bálor/Devitt was surreal to see. 🤩
Michael Hayes still dressing like that
We never thought we'd see Punk & Steph hugging each other....Furthermore, the goosebumps when Paul & Punk hugged...
This is how you capitalized off of social media,these behind the scenes are so awesome
Damn, this video gave me chills and goosebumps all over again tears and all, what a wonderful year it has been for CM Punk despite the set backs and what a stellar year for WWE in a whole.  This was the moment aedoodoo got Knocked-Out forever.
Awesome thank for uploading this 🎉
Sorry I’m not a fan of punk!  He left 10 or more foe Aew and now he wants everyone to welcome him in!  I don’t!
Everybody thinks Seth’s reaction was story I don’t buy it
Can’t believe it’s been a year already
Genuinely happy for CM PUNK.. that man gave us golden matches at his peak. He deserves all the love ❤
Steph there?
So great to see Punk and Corey Graves put their differences aside and ultimately make peace.  Also:  Bayley: "Bring HER in"  She knew the assignment.
Seeing this with my dad is something ill never forget
This is honestly the best thing ever ! I still can’t believe my hero is back!!  Also would of loved to have seen Seth’s back stage reaction hahaha
"Good seeing you here" from one former AEW guy to another was cool to see
And Seth…. 🙂🙂
as long hes happy and not causing trouble or they dont cause him trouble im all for him back in wwe
cm punk finally shook stephanie's right hand 😂
Cm punk best in the world
Where's the part where Seth greets him lolllll
Such a great behind the scenes video! That was Awesome! As a fan of Wrestling and of Punk this video made me smile from ear to ear! He actually looked nervous before he went out.
As a fan from the of era brings tears to my eyes the interactions with the OGs like kofi and randy
What about Seth? Did he knows abouts punk return? Or he just was piss
They didnt show seth rolling 😂
Great moment 🔥🔥🔥🔥
this was so cool to watch man, i was so shocked when cm punk returned, i screamed i could not believe it.
WWE is just too lit 🔥💯
Cameraman knew the assignment when filming Bayley.
Remember sitting in my bedroom my wife heard me marking out when Cm Punk music popped!!!!
0:33 I love the fact that William Regal didn't wanna miss a thing
Seth not being seen greeting Punk here adds more fuel to the notion that he was genuinely pissed
This was awesome
CM Punk returns!? I'm all in!
Shotzi is so dope lol
I love that Bailey was essentially her old star struck gimmick
Let's talk about that outfit Michael Hayes has on. Pimping since pimping since pimping
time to watch this 100+ times now
Modern Randy Orton seems like the coolest vet to work with
I’m “Crying A River” watching this …
I want to see the footage of Seth in Gorilla!   (Did yall peep that smile drop after he hugged Corey Graves?)
🥹❤️
Punk wouldn’t talk to regal when the were both in Aew because he was a stooge for hhh(punks words) how things have changed.
Good to see these two bury the hatchet.
HHH Era Rules
Love seeing the behind the scenes stuff. Hey WWE, ever think of producing a show of just behind the scenes for Raw, SD and Premium Live Events. 30 to 60 min show weekly or monthly, all access. Everything to meetings with the bookers to run throughs, everything. I bet a lot of fans would love a show like this.
I think this might be the greatest return of all time
Best return ever, one of the best moments in WWE
Waiting to handshake with Seth 😅
El gran si em ponk
I was there my third wwe event and it was my favorite. really great seats behind commentary there was one guy that flipped the crowd of every time a cm punk chant would start and then at the end here he was at the end of the night best night of my life so far. I'm only 23
5:24 everyone greeting punk after their match, well almost everyone… 😂 suck it seth & drew 🤡
He looks great
Great video wwe. But a commercial every 60 seconds, come on YouTube.
6:49 Literally my profile picture 😆👌
We need Dustin Rhodes back in Survivor series. Return. Just like punk. Did return at survivor series. And NOW was gonna be Golddust Dustin Rhodes back return what if triple H and Stephanie McMahon will approve for Dusty Rhodes Royal rumble. Austin, Texas.  And opponents for dusty Rhodes Royal rumble match with  Cody Rhodes and Golddust, Dustin Rhodes and Randall Orton in Hunter, Triple H, the sledgehammer  the new statue would be  American nightmare Dusty Rhodes   That is a great idea for the national holiday. Dusty Rhodes day.  In American nightmare day.   And the best idea for undisputed WWE world heavyweight tag team championship titles would be Cody Rhodes in with Dustin go dust RHODES  team American nightmare  What is Cody and Dustin Rhodes would be at Georgia Bulldogs game at Athens, Georgia  an extra Georgia Bulldogs undisputed title  what if Cody Rhodes sings Georgia Bulldogs fight song and take a vote Georgia Bulldogs will be number one vote for both of you, Cody Rhodes, and Dustin Rhodes and bring the RHODES family at Athens, Georgia, Georgia game all the votes from the Rhodes family stay with Georgia Bulldogs, all votes and next week next April 19 and 20th would be at Athens, Georgia  for the opening ceremony for a new wrestlemania 42 XXXL four 2025  And national anthem of the United States of America. Make sure get approved by Donald J Trump. And JD Vince and  Mike Johnson  who is the president of Athens, Georgia Kelly Gertz   Andre Dickens the president of Atlanta, Georgia   And the companies of WWE is triple H Stephanie McMahon family. Of the board.    To pass the torch. Of national anthem  to light on USA flag. On fire. For national anthem for Pinch black
Based on the cuts and the screen in the back showing the show they definitely edited out Drew and Seth when they got to the back. Keeping Kayfabe. To explain cuz I was there live, you see a 2nd camera right before a random like 2 minute cut, after the match Drew walked back to gorilla and  a camera followed him back there so he ran into Punk no matter what. Also after the show was over, Cole and Seth walked to the back together so they cut Seth running into Punk as well which was obvious as Becky was right there waiting for him.
The Best in the world CM Punk
Thing that sucks for me with this return is my friend called me and ruined it cause I was like 30 minutes behind since I got home after it started 😐. My friend doesn’t know how to keep his mouth shut from ruining surprises.
Seth crashed out
MODERN DAY CURTAIN CALL
How long till he's hurt again?
Chills till this day! I really never thought this would happen! One of the wwe’s goat moments.
This was absolutely fantastic.  That pop… my god 😮 Back where he belongs!
This just shows anyone could return if they make peace with their demons
Wwe really need ads on YouTube come on
Stephanie is still smoking hot
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Crazy how I was a fan of punk until i realize he’s a hypocrite and money hungry at his age and y’all support this is crazy to me everything this guy said about them in 2011 or whatever it was is true til this day and for him to go back on his word and come back like he said for money is trash help these young cats really grow and people like miz etc deserve way much more but they settle and they are humble.
Sooo, were just gonna skip over Seth's reaction completely??
Aqui tenemos una clase MAGISTRAL ... De como "SE ROMPE INTERNET".  Nada que decir , un momento que va a quedar plasmado en los ojos de los fanaticos por toda la vida.
0:42 Guess he doesn't care about where he hand has been anymore 😂😂😂
Stephanie acting like she wasnt talking a lot of smack ever since he left😹😹😹
Definitely one of the goats bruh 💯
And to some people. They’ll think this is real lol
The fact that they didn't show Seth and Punk moments backstage is quite disappointing but good at the same time
Omg randy 😭❤
Have I watched this 15 times on repeat in one day? Yes. Do I care? No. Do I judge you for doing the same. No... I do not.
Thanks Jack Perry, we had CM Punk here  👋🏾🎉
Hell froze over
Everyone is asking what happened between him and seth But nobody is talking about this 6:55 moment, randy was pissed off LMAO
This behind the scenes made Tony Con feared for his life
Assalamu Alaikum Semi zain 🖤
How can you not watch this with the BIGGEST smile on your face?? 😊 one of the best moments in sports. Ever.
You notice from previous backstage footage that Vince is in there's an undercurrent of nerves and tension. With Hunter it's nerves, but it's the exciting kind of nerves, and the backstage atmosphere is lighthearted and happy. SO glad Vinnie Mac is finally gone!
Can someone tell me where is Seth when everyone else give congratulations to Punk?
cm punk crazy return!
WWE is the best
Cool. 7 ad breaks in a 9 minute video.  SMH.
6:57 😳😳😳😳
Never realized Finn Balor was that much bigger than CM punk.
I’d forgotten how loud that pop was!!
These little peeks behind the scenes are amazing
This is the Punk footage we actually wanted!
This is awesome 🥰🥰🥰
wish punk was still rocking this look... much prefer this fresh cut hair look and trimmed beard.  what a time to be alive living this moment.
I can’t get over how giddy Stephanie is.
I hate that they stole Randy’s moment. This literally could’ve waited until Raw.
The security in the beginning lol , jaw instantly dropped
One of the best nights in wwe ever
Redefined wrestling all over again😱😱. CM Punk=🐐
This video sums up so beautifully why I love pro wrestling. There’s no place else you can feel these things. It’s special.
4:12 is that johnny wrestling peaking from behind the curtain? lol.
"STOP BREAKING KAYFABE, WWE!" ~the smarks  Punk really didn't lie. It was warm hugs all around for his return to WWE. I love to see it.
Had goosebumps while watching this.
HMMM... no seth???... he was probably crying in the back while wearing becky's shoes...
Great watch!!❤️🤍🖤🩶
Under Vince this probably would've never happened. Under HHH everything is possible. This was an amazing night.
I love how they do this now..
Good job cutting the seth rollins interaction backstage, im sure it went along the lines of “we are about to make so much ******* money”
Did anyone else notice the woman gasp when she saw CM Punk lol
Welcome home cm punk, so glad to see you happy again
Where’s Seth Rollins real reaction?😅
This is a horror movie to tony Khan
Thank you Jungle Boy and Tony Khan for making this possible !! 😂
I am grinning ear to ear...What a great segment.
This moment is still surreal to me... I can't believe he is actually back still
Tony khan cried watching this
His theme song blasting and he's like nothing happened lmao
I love this
These future documentaries going be crazy 💯
a year later and it STILL gives chills!
Cm punk is boring, unathletic and out of shape.
Still kinda blows my mind that we got to see even this.
So cool you have to watch it twice type of stuff!
God damn this gives me goosebumps 🤌🏽
CM Punk one of the best!!! WWE Raw should stay on television network USA & not Netflix in 2025 😢😢 I'm not going to be able to see WWE Raw again Mr. Triple H pls think about the fans
Its good to see behind the scene 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
They certainly cut off the moment where Seth comes and hugs Punk.
Greatest return of all times❤ 0:21
How many times as Tony khan watched this 😅😂
Greatest return of all time
MY GOOSEBUMPS HAD GOOSEBUMPS....ALL THE TIME!!!!
Jeez in less than 7 hours and this video already has a half a million views
i couldn't stop smiling from the moment i pressed play
he seems so happy to be home ,it's good to see him and triple hhh getting along
Everytime I see his return I get goose bumps.  And that's because of 2 things: first being he is without a shadow of a doubt the most polarizing figure in the business today (because love him or hate him, he is must-see) and the second being that I think most people thought he had completely burned the bridge with WWE to the point of no return.
Yo, I gotta admit, when Punk came back to WWE, I was skeptical as hell, and was 100% a doubter. But I can also admit when I'm wrong.  Way to kill the game and be a leader, Punk!
The thing that made me mad about this is that I watched the WHOLe thing just for this and I exited as fast as I could once I seen the rights, then I went on ig and saw I was like damn I really just stopped watching when it got good.
the best return to wwe EVER
THAT POP WAS CRAZYYY!!!
BOBBY ROOOOOODE!! GLORIOUS
Unbelievable moment
ICONIC   so excited for the Aj Lee return 😌😌
Watching his return still makes me tear up a year later dude.
Damn WWE chill with the ads
How about Seth Rollins !
How about Seth Rollins
A year later and this still gives me chills!!!
Amazing. Brought back so many feelings and I was truly never a fan of Punk till now. 🔥
I appreciate this video so much
Thank you Triple H for bringing back CM Punk
Bayley bit her lip watching that return lol
Thank you Jack Perry
One of the greatest returns of all time
In Tony Khans famous words “Thanks guys”
Freaking awesome
Cm punks cut looked fresh
Honestly i was searching for this video for a year. finally they gave us this beautiful BTS
Loudest pops in the history of WWE  1. Stone Cold 2. Rock 3. CM Punk
Wonder if that quick interaction with punk/regal was awkward since Punk supposedly called out Regal in AEW saying he didn’t trust him and was a stooge for HHH when regal first debuted
Orton is the man.
It's great that Rollins isn't seen.
I'm calling it now. Seth Rollins is going to cost OG Bloodline the match at Wargames by attacking Punk and turning heel.
Did anyone else get 17 ads during this 10 min clip?
we all have HHH to thank for all this
i can tell how much CM Punk and Triple H have matured.. Once enemies, Now friends.
Man... ive been watching weekly since before i could remember. Born in 1993, watching with my mother and continuing the tradition-  and loving shawn and hunter all my life. Then CM Punk along with many other names that i love, this was incredible and made me emotional seeing trips and punk hug after all these years. Then all the others he greeted at gorilla.  I love professional wrestling.
Did anyone notice Steph went to Punk for a hug and he straight up ignored her 😬
we want a documentary on this return alone
who says wwe dont get you emotional anymore   Man …. This is …. Cant describe
I want See Seth Reaktion Backstage 😅
That was another amazing interaction between the goat Randy Orton and cm punk.
No matter what, I always get chills watching his return
Best return in the WORLDDDDDD
This is what I've been waiting for since history happened.
Him and Orton is GOLD. Where… WHERE is that tag team!? 😂😂😂
I was legitimately was going to turn the show off at the time when it ended, but as soon as I heard the static and Cult of Personality, I lost my voice.
Bro I was there!I couldn’t believe it!Like my favorite wrestler is back in WWE!
I really don't like C. M. PUNK
No doubt he and Seth talk backstage they just hiding it lol
🔥🔥🔥
i did not expect to cry
Best Night And Best ⚡️Return EVER 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This made me so nervous just to watch even though I know whats happening
Was that william regal at 2:43
I remember turning it off because I thought yeah na he’s not coming back then he did then I had go back thanks instergram
I love the reaction from Randy Orton, just like seeing an old friend..   That and also the hug between Kofi and Punk, wholesome moment
Orton's reaction is pure gold 😂😂😂
It was amazing
Hell of a return! Class!
I swear those CM punk chants haunted vince for years
Bailey brought the cake I noticed
I was waiting for the Rollins interaction haha
When that static hits and the crowd goes wild man it gets me every time I’ll never get tired of watching this
I want to see the footage of Drew and Seth coming back in and congratulating Punk too, but that would ruin the storylines. 😉
Who else's face is locked in the biggest smile?
Triple H smells big success
chicago, chicago chicago 😂😂😂😂😂
Still can't believe, feels so surreal
Glad Vince is gone cuz he would never
When are we gonna get cm punk the movie
9:04 🫂CHICAGO CHICAGO CHICAGOOOOOOOOOOO
AEWist are you feeling okay?
So glad that CM Punk came home, and super glad they film this so we can enjoy it later. Awesome job all around
They shouldn't have had them both come back on the same night. It took away from both of their returns...
What a time to be alive
I see Seth didn’t come to the back and greet CM Punk 😂! 3:19 thank me later! Bayley 🍑
When I tell you me and my sister's jaws were on the floor!!! I was genuinely shocked, what a great surprise!
Punk was so happy he was getting pointed at 😂😂😂. Also seeing everyone so siked to see him is beautiful.
Que cosa más brutal y emocionante 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏻
CM Pun
The Rock and his team of writers gonna have this taken down and then re-uploaded with interviews of him saying it was all his idea.
I know a lot of the old school fans are not fond of these "breaking kayfabe" behind the scenes vids but the sport has evolved and times are changing and as long as they dont show it right away(like the WM 40 behind the scenes) where they show it months after it happened, Im totally cool with it and I hope everyone else is too.
The shock on the guy's face standing near the curtain at 00:03
Damnn I wanted to see Seth come through the curtain
AEW should have appreciated treasured and leveraged CM Punk. Instead it preferred to be   uninterested uncaring to him, leading him to departing and returning to WWE where his name and popularity is unrelenting.
Best in world❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊
We got BTS footage of CM Punk’s WWE return before GTA 6
I still get such chills and goosebumps a year later watching this return, you can feel that electricity through your screen. Truly the day Hell froze over
Woww 🔥
best return ever of modern history
Rhea posting up by cm punk while judgement walk by was cool asf lol
I hate how after all these years, im starting to like CM Punk 😂
Didn’t see him with Seth backstage I guess Seth really don’t like punk
Not showing Rollins' backstage interaction just to keep a bit of magic 🤣 I'm not even mad, it's perfect in context
I was in jail during this😭 I ain’t going outside until Survivor Series 😂
The Randy bit was great
I think CM Punk could have returned at the Royal Rumble. Almost every body had predicted that Punk would return in Survivor Series. It should have been actually Randy's spotlight. Since Triple H keeps surprises therefore Punk returning at the Royal Rumble would have been emotional since most legends return at the Royal Rumble. And the Survivor Series should have been Randy's since he was returning after a year and half from an almost career threatening injury.
Nice to see that after 13 years, Punk can now feel comfortable shaking Stephanie's hand.
Damn Bailey
Guess we weren't supposed to see Becky there to congratulate him.
1:18 Your way of thinking speaks volumes
Man he was nervous 😅
Randy 😂
Is that Becky lynch at 2:45? I can’t tell
is damien a possible feud too? they skipped him he was first in gorrilla but they cut it to rhea
I would like the opinion of someone who was at the event. From the video it is really noisy, but when CM Punk enters the arena and they frame him it seems that the audio is lowered. Real level of pop compared to other pops (including his return to AEW)?
Ngl if I was punk I would be nervous asf to do that 😂
michael hayes is such a clown
So it's like Stephanie only there for PLEs.
Where is Seth Rollins kid?
Chills
I find it funny they didn’t show any interaction with Rollins if there was one 😂
Thank you, Young Bucks.   Thank you, Hangman Adam Page.   Thank you, Kenny Omega.   Thank you, Jack Perry.   Thank you, Real Glass.  Thank you, Tony Khan, for turning the impossible into reality.  Y'all's sacrifice won't be forgotten. 🫡
When Vince McMahon started laughing at the end of the hell in the cell match between the fiend and Seth Rollins, that solidified that he never cared
Being there live. There were some of us there who truly believed. During this moment I was recording, because I felt this same energy his music was about to hit. @2:20 Sheesh what an adrenaline rush for the greatest surprise return of all time. Greatest wrestling experience I’ve ever had. Legendary moment
This is all you need to do to make him be fine with you respect him and actually work with him by hearing him, Tony Khan didn't do that, because like I said a billion times Tony Khan is tge boss but only on paper, but we all know who the real bosses are.
This was the greatest wrestling moment of my life. It’s enough to make a grown man cry
The biggest return in the sports history 🙌
Best in the world ❤
Orton’s return should’ve been the biggest part of the show last year. Ruined by the spotlight stealing grandpa.
I couldnt stop smiling....
I lost my mind when this happened, and I was like 99% certain I knew it was coming. Still got me.
The Greatest return of all time ❤
The moment that brought me back to wrestling
Merci beaucoup JUGGALO BOI.
Forever goosebumps
First cody,literally a EVP of AEW  And then punk of all people.  I’m calling it,some day,1-5 years maybe,if he’s in better condition and it doesn’t force him to retire and he keeps going,I’m gonna call it  Kenny omega may someday sign with WWE
Bayley has them cakes 🍑
Everyone there just knew wrestling history was being made in that moment. This will be one of those things that’s talked about 50 years from now in the business 🤌🏼
❤️
With the Hardy Boys at Wrestlemania 33 this the greatest return of all time.
CHICAGO CHICAGO CHICAGO
👀 @ 3:18 That DONK.
Look how positive the vibe is.  Remember how the haters were trying to claim that most were upset with Punk coming back?  These backstage clips give the only perspective needed.
Bayley freaking out running to the gorila is the most bayley things ever
Thank You ❤
I'm sure as hell everyone was waiting for Seth to come down into the gorilla and greet Punk
Did we just capture a glimpse of Stu, Stu from John Cena’s shoutout? 🤯😅😎👊
كانت اجواء الجنونيه😢😂
Omg it was what a great video, i enjoyed a lot, please more of these
No seth rollins reaction?
Awesome
how can you not love Randy Orton bro 😭😭😭😭
the Best surprise ever
Randy Orton's aura is on another level!
Stil have goosebumps
Yet Netflix claims WWE isn't FAKE 😅  We all know. It's scripted.
Randy & Kofi had the best reactions
where was seth😂😂😂
Download it otherwise they re gonna dlt it
Looks like he really needed that hug from Kofi 🥲
Roman Reigns return behind the scene summer slam
Faut doser avec les pubs
Now that's how to be become a future hall of famer 🤞🤞💯🔥🔥👏👏👏👏
Punk and noble...Roh fans know....
Not even trying to sell the product at this point, just sucking all the magic and mystery out if it.
We can finally see that heated cage argument Punk and Triple H had LMAO  He was really confused on where to go 😭
Shows how a real company works
The greatest return in the 2020s honestly
Thank You Jungle Boy, Thank You Bucks, Thank You Kenny and Thank You TK 🤡.  GOATED MOMENT.
Becky was not pleased to see him at all
Randy is happy to see his former opponent ❤️❤️🥹this is my fav wwe event coz my two goats returned on same night
That was one of the best moments I ever had as a wwe fan.
Thank you jungle boy
Damn seth really wasnt happy to see punk🤣🤣
Randy interaction was great "Can I have 10 minutes?"
Imagine Jack Perry in 2014 thinking when CM punk left WWE, he would be the reason punk would go back. How nuts if jack got to know back then in 2014.
I like how despite this being a behind the scenes, they still didn’t show Seth or Drew.
Cm punk is back where he belongs
SOMEWHERE.... they have Seth coming back stage....
Chills a year later
My 🐐🐐🐐 cm punk and Randall
Everyone in that match greeted him, EXCEPT Seth Rollins. Still not sure if that was strategic, or he genuinely didn't talk to him. Seemed like he really was mad and didn't want to talk to him. PErhaps they just edited it out to set up a feud? That said, so happy Punk is back. I feel like Rollins is gonna turn heel at SSWG.
We need more of these "behind the scenes". It's nice to see performers engaging with one another after they did their job. Wishing to see the making of "drew vs punk" feud
They showed the backstage meetup with all except the two of them one is Seth and another was McIntyre
Bayley instantly changed back into a hugger.
Oh you gonna point at me? 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤cm
The best birthday present I ever got
Wholesome moment 💯
Thanks to Triple H 🔥
Newest
So many ads for a short video
thank you, tony, for choosing the "scapegoat" over the BITW.
Legends back stage also, Former NXT General Manager Steven Regal, Free bird Michael PS Hayes, Stephanie McMahon, HHH and Brother Love aka Bruce Prichard.
5:56 to think we haven’t gotten Finn v Punk is insane!
Like Travis Scott Said Get Those Goosebumps Every Time 🥶🥶After Tens Years The Best Cm👊🏽Punk Returned Home ❌❌❌👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
hell froze over Man this return is special we'll for me it is
No Seth at all 😂
Did the clip get cut before Punk finished saying, "You are my favorite… Kingston"? 6:09
I would pay to see Seth's backstage reaction to CM Punk return.🎉🎉🎉
Not sure which was the loudest pop. His AEW debut or his WWE return.
One of the greatest WWE returns of all time!
BAYLEY'S CAKE UNBLEAVIBLE
Hope this time there's no pipe bomb Promo.
Ohh jungle boy, you’ve just created the biggest butterfly effect in the pro wrestling industry. Now go cry us the ocean….
Nice to see Regal as a producer.
God Stephanie is looking exactly like Vince when she hug punk wow time flies
7:07 the GOAT and the  Best in the World 🐍🥹✨
This and edge best returns of all time
All along i thought that CM PUNK would never come back to WWE.
This guy changed my life. I hated him in 2007-2009 and then i fell in love with him when I realized he wasnt doing a gimmick and he was just being himself. in 2011 after the infamous pipebomb promo, I instantly knew that this is my fugging hero. And Ive followed him ever since, no matter where he's been , Ufc or aew, Espn, or a bunch of side roles in movies, I supported him and always wanted to catch a glimpse on him on tv. Last year in on December 25th, I was in the hospital fighting for my life due an entangled hernia , a ruptured appendix and 2.5ft of infected intestines. I fought through a 4 hour surgery, and when I woke up I was in pain, I couldnt feel my legs , I had this discomfort . That night I got my phone and wanted to contact a few of my friends, and tell them I was okay, and I saw a Video of Cm punks return like 5 minutes ago and screamed like a 10 year old, and all the doctors, patients , janitors and nurses panicked and rushed to check on me, marking out to cm punk returning. I was so happy to see him back , and I forgot all the pain and I started tweeting and watched the full show to see him. It gave me hope, and will power , and then 2 days later I walked out of the hospital feeling as fresh as i could. I dont know if Phil will ever get to see this comment, but If he ever does, I want to Thank You for being my hero. Im 31 but Ill always cheer you on like a child.
Becky Lynch was in gorilla position when Punk returned aha knew before Rollins did
Good lawd Bayley 3:18 🍑
AURA
This is so surreal. I love Punk so much!
First never and I mean NEVER forget to thank....Jack, the dumb Perry for this.....second watching HHH peeking to see thought the curtain is so wholesome, Punk hugging Steph also.....You can see Regal and Punk when he said to Punk "look at us here" with a hand gesture, Bayley rushing into the run along with all the girls to get punk when he goes back also awesome, Randy and Punk exchange had me in the floor laughing XD, so awesome to see them mad respect, and man that pop I had my headphones put and have to pull them off that was laud when Punk goes to the curtain XD.
Where was Rollins 😂🎉
लाउडेस्ट पॉप इन wwe
Wow, even Stephanie embraced him. This is such a bizarro foorage to see.
The guy screaming CHICAGO, should’ve said “cry me a river Tony”
I'm still crying 😭😭😭
What the hell is PS wearing?
This is awesome to watch
almost didn't recognize dom without the stash
Such a wholesome thing man, so happy im alive to watch this
Such a great night.
thank you AEW
the greatest moment of our generation 👌🏽
Insane
Was that bobby roode i saw at 2:26  ?
Get ready to hear light it up this Saturday. 😏
Truly an OMG moment!
randy orton 🤝 cm punk .
Everybody say thank you Jack one more time 🎉
Randy is so great that he did not let Punk feel as if he stole his moment. You earned our respect Randy.
The minutes are few...
I will never thank Perry the bucks page or Tony khan F all of them forever I hope they go out of business forever
The cult of personality
As someone who loves being in production with a triple H role.. I TRULY appreciate all the behind the scenes clips WWE. Makes people realize all the real work that’s been done for the fans to enjoy.
GIVE us a full DOC on this return ⚡️
Bruce didn't look that happy
I would personally like to thank The Elite, Jack Perry, and especially Tony Khan for this beautiful moment. They really changed the game FOREVER.
THE BEST IN THE WORLDDDDDDDDD CM PUNK IS BACK
Was that Michael ps Hayes there in that white hat?
"Best for business".
Ive got to say it wwe network 2014/15-2025 may you “rest in peace” as the undertaker would say😢
Man one year has passed since CM Punk made his monumental epic return in WWE. Never in a million years would I have ever expected this. Time flies by fast. It’s still unreal that Punk is back home in WWE after all this time.
Best return ever❤
Cm punk still sucks period who really cares about CM punk he is a Nimrod.
Seth Rollin and Drew Mcintyre reaction 😤😡😠 Jungle Boy reaction 🤬👿
It’s about damn time this came out!
6:56 Randy Orton ❤ CM Punk 🫶
Randy: Can I not enjoy 10 min of my F return Punk: Cry me a river
His return still makes me cry every time I watch it 🥹 It feels damn good to be a wrestling fan 💯
0:25 That's Ashante? 👀
I THOUGHT CM PUNK WAS A LOCKER ROOM CANCER?????? Thank you Jungle Girl 🎉
This was so cool to see!
I miss the orginal theme they used for him, this remix or remake whatever it is aint legendary like the prior version
It’s insane how this was the ultimate nail in the coffin, everyone said he was washed that he was done and dude has just performed better and better and better !
I can’t believe this was a year ago today. I night I will NEVER forget. If I’m 96 (if I make it there) and I’m on my deathbed with Alzheimers and dementia, I’ll still never forget that night.
Only Seth Rollins can't tolerate C M Punk's returning 🙄
I get the point picture!!😂😂😂
Se me eriza la piel
This is awesome 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩❤️❤️❤️
The biggest hypocrite in the history of the business
A year ago I dreaded this after all of the drama at AEW and seeing how slow and sloppy his matches there were. It took a year, a couple of decent funds, one incredible feud and a 5 star hell in the cell and I'm pumped about Punk again.
6:55 Book it Paul… Turn Randy heel, turn Punk heel, doesn’t matter. Punk rained* on Orion’s return, there’s a story there  *I just want to clarify, I’m speaking in terms of kayfabe. I know us wrestling fans get a bit upset with misunderstandings. I don’t think there’s actually hurt feelings lol
Someone feared for his life that night 😂
I've been waiting for this 1 year. Deserve it!
I remember seeing this on Peacock and losing my mind.  Such an epic return and we're just getting started.  Also loved how Triple H kept looking through the curtain.  This is something that likely wouldn't have happened were Vince at the helm, best of all is it seems like Punk's behaving this time around almost like he wants to be there and stay there.
Wish i could see Seth going back backstage
every penny i spent this day to see it was worth it
Is it me or does William Regal doesn't look to pleased. Did they ever have beef?
I love behind the curtain stuff
Triple H is the real "Peacemaker"...he brings everyone together
LMFAO "I'm going to get the pointing picture" @5:18
Where was Seth 😅
5:14 When he realizes he’s getting the point lmao
Who is was waiting for Seth to meet punk backstage😂
Bro returned on my birthday 🎉
I have waited a whole year for this footage…
Thanks Jungle Boy 🙏🏽
Now give this man his wrestlemania main event moment at mania 41 this year
When Bruce says ‘I double dog dare ya’ you probably shouldn’t do what he’s saying lmao
Triple H is like Kakashi watching Sasuke make his return home.
Randy  😂😂
Stephanie hugs like Vince 😂
0:41 Punk finally shakes THAT hand.  Long. Term. Storytelling.
I'd like to thank "real glass" for all it's done for wrestling 😂 😂
Heyman just fed millions of families after reuniting with punk and this moment still feels surreal 🥹🥹
The eyeroll at Michael PS Hayes' outfit. Chefs kiss!
I love seeing these behind the scenes videos. The production, the real interaction is amazing to see unfold.
The AEW return was great, but this felt like another level
Legendary
Man when Randy Orton met CM Punk backstage i can tell that Randy was pissed off in the inside but he tried to play it off on the outside i just knew Randy felt like he was over shadowed by Punk
Love how they kept Seth off the video 😂 Makes it look like my dawg is still ringside cheesed that punks back
This was better than behind the scene of wrestle mania 😂😂😂
Man you can cut the tension with a knife in Gorilla
Thanks Jack perry button ^
This was unreal....😍🫡
My buddy made a joke about CM Punk coming back at SS last year and I’m glad it was real.
This behind the scene video > AEW whole career!
One of the best returns in recent history still get goosebumps watching
This is so wholesome....
punk vs balor need that
Sold out the entire locker room and all the people doing things the right way but HEY it made HHH and all the CORPORATE @$$holes a huge paycheck and that is ALL they care about. ITs a money making business not a entertainment business
But Tony Feared for his life though
Inject this into my veins
Im still getting chills a year later
Why didn't Seth Rollins come to greet him? I think it's disrespectful not to be part of this historic moment.
And then he proceeds to have one of the greatest feuds of the year  And now in the main event of survivor series war games 2024
Clever is not showing Punk and Rollins interact backstage because there's still an entire feud to be had.
Absolute Goosebumps
I’ve been waiting one year for this video what a legendary moment
One of the greatest nights ever in WWE
THAT POP
Cm punk is for whimps
Always heartwarming to see William Regal still in the game. What a legend.
So badass
How many ads do you need for a 10 minute video, good grief, let me watch my BTS in peace, damn
What a great return
Legendary 🔥
Would’ve loved to see Seth and Drew’s reactions backstage. But apparently Drew was so upset that he left the building
WWE will always be THE number 1 Wrestling company in the world….The WWE is in good hands
I vividly remember being left in genuine shock when that static hit. My favorite WWE moment of all time ❤️
3 sec in and the lady in the back had me in tears with her reaction
Wanted to see Seth and punk
No backstage interactions between punk and seth! Lol
4:56 poor stephanie went for a hug but he didnt see her😂😂😂😂
Damn that place must have been loud af, that a Beatles-esque pop 😂
Literal Chills all over again
6:56 I Love Randy 😂🖤
Damn I wish we could of seen when drew and Seth waked backstage and saw him
Dirty Dom looked just a tad star struck there haha.
Oh wow the algorithm is wild because I just watched an interview of him saying that we’ll probably see this eventually 😅
Bro this is so crazy!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Dude I totally get Punks confusion now when he talked about this. "Go to the cages!" He was already confused going in there. This makes more more sense now.
Appreciate this a lot! , you can tell Punk was nervous I know a lot was going through his head at that moment
No seth rollins on the edit? Dang that beef really has some guts to it
This is dope would’ve been cool to see the Seth drama also play out (:
The fact that they didn't show seth and Drew's interaction with CM punk shows how badly they want this rivalry to go on
9:00 The fan that hugged him ... And chant Chicago... Lost his iPhone right?😅
Greatest return in WWE history
"My friend and I are having a competition to get the most likes. He’s at 7k and ahead of me. Like this comment to help me catch up!"
Honestly never felt goosebumps like his return as much as i love bray wyatt punk drew the entire crowd in, so grateful that i go to be front and centre for punks last aew match haha
Randy's reaction is the best lol!!!!
I love in depth behind the scenes returns like this.
Greatest return imo
So cool
Whos here after his interview With Cube
The only people who didn’t shake hands with Punk were Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch (Seth’s wife). Either there’s still amount of kayfabe that wrestlers play or the punk and Seth stuff is actually real 😊
Notice they must have taken Seth backstage through a different route.
4:56 "bring her in" "I'll do what I can, you do your job and I'll do mine" AJ?
It‘s kinda funny how they cutted out the sequence where Seth and Drew saw him backstage, I‘m sure they also gave each other a hug
Punk your going point at me let's go lol
I'm so glad, I put up the channel on the last moments, in the hopes of his returns, one of the best moments out there
Who is that black dude with the headsets ?
Who notices jj security 😊😂
What a pop🎉
3:17 Bayley I love you so much man😭
he truly is the best in the world, much love for our favourite punker 🖤
TRIPLE H like a little kid peeking out the curtains 😂 this was awesome! Still gives me goosebumps.
Love CM Punk ❤
Triple H & Stephanie: You could not live with your own failure & where did that bring you? Back to us.
Nice Video I Like Behind Scenes 😊
i think this is hard to top this year
Randy Orton though 😅
-_________- Wat a waist of everyone's time! Anyone else would have been better than cm sucks
Randy is built like a tank bro
It’s nice to know wwe cared about randy orton returning after he thought his career was over . So very freaking nice
😍
We got CM Punk back in WWE before GTA 6
I thousand damn ads just to see this
Honestly, I'm sad I missed this Survivor Series in person. I was at Punk's return in Chicago for Rampage I could not hear myself scream. I can only imagine how a surprise return could only have been better.
My eyes tears
This return was the best and emotional for me 😊
What a moment 🔥🤍
This was great ❤
and Seth wanted to basically get his hands on punk quick as possible but they would not let him
The era of triple H leading wwe is looking good so far
CM Punk signed his contract 5 minutes before his return to wwe.
I don't know why i smile so much after seeing this  Genuine happiness ❤
Randy coming through was so wholesome ❤
6:08 “i didn’t know you were gonna be here, you’re a favorite” 🥹
One of the best returns ever!
The Chicago guy, greatest moment of his wrestling life
Chills !!
The crowd is louder than the actual music itself
YouTube 'I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to show you an Ad every 3 minutes'
BEST IN THE WORLD🙌🏼❤️ CM PUNK💀
Probably the best ending to any WWE PLE EVER
That was a iconic moment when cm punk return i didn’t know William was there including Stephanie everyone was in shock to see punk back
Just like the first dance I still get chills watching this over and over!!
Hahaha, I LOVE Randy calling him out on dampening his own return! XD
This makes me so happy. What a moment.
Miss this haircut
One of the best moments of my life watching this man return!
Special Thanks to tony khan and jack perry for this legendary moment 🔥😂
09:00 that day a legend was born: Chicago man
Look in my butt what do you see a whole bunch of poopie
The best in the world after god
That pop was insane
Seeing Regal in gorilla just makes me so f***ing happy
After nearly a whole decade Punk returns home in the best way he could in his home state. Amazing how this was a year ago and Punk so far since his return gave us one of the best feuds of 2024 between him and Drew McIntyre and now reinvolving himself with helping an old friend in Paul Heyman in War Games. In a sense it all comes full circle, Punk returned at Survivor Series last year after the War Games match and this year he's in the War Games match.
Thank you, Tony Khan Thank you, Matty and Nicky Thank you, Kenny Olivier  Thank you, Hangma'am Page Thank you, Jungle Douche  Thank you for being incompetent babies and making the one bridge that felt burnt forever be rebuilt
i love how they didn't show seth coming back stage 😂😂
I want more like this on every return
Sooo wholesome. BEEN WAITING FOREVER for this vid.
Foe 💀 Randy’s reaction
Damn Punk was just talking about this. Happened just like he said.
Did I really need 3 ads in this 9 minute video WWE?
LOL 😂😂😂 the photo was HHH blowing up the Internet
Becky lynch was there backstage
One year anniversary...Can't believe it happened one year ago, I remembered it like it was yesterday. What an iconic moment, one of the most loudest and emotional pop of all time for a historical return, I will never forget the feelings and the emotions I had when Cult of Personality hit, so nostalgic to me already... Thank you WWE, what an era❤
What a night, R Truth returned!!!
Tony Khan needs to know who to keep around and who to let go 😂
That smile!!!
4:06 "you're paying my paycheck of course I am going to kiss your a$$ now" 😂😂😂
HAVE ONE YEAR
Thank you CM PUNK
F to spoilers
What a moment 😌
Quante volte ho detto che amo CMPUNK??? ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Can't I enjoy 10 minutes of my  f*cking return" - Randy Orton 😂😂😂
this makes me so happy man 1 year later and its feels unreal Thank you for coming back,Punk.
It still make me emotional, we waiting for 10 yesrs CM PUNK IS FINNALY BACKKKK!!!!!!,
Seeing Triple H in Vince’s spot will never get old
The days are long, but the years are short.. cant believe its been a year, this seemed like it happened the other day
I thought he was still in aew? Haven’t been keeping up with wrestling lately
I noticed they never showed Seth.  Did he go past punk without acknowledging him.  We know drew stormed out the building.   Cm punk cm punk cm punk cm punk .  🤍🖤❤️💙
HHH and Punk hugging it out. So refreshing.
Man this was beautiful
Bro this was the best thing WWE could have ever done but I still respect the OGs and Vince for keeping Kayfabe as long as they could
Best thing that happened in 2023
Life's emotional
Cannot wait for this sunday
1 of my favorite comeback in history 🔥🔥
This still gives me goosebumps 1 year later..HOLY FRIGGIN🤫
lol this is it? 9 min of nothing we didnt already know
“I double dog dare ya” -Bruce while HHH looks through the curtain got me 💀😂
I hope he gets his WrestleMania main event in 2025 I waited so long now for his moment.❤
The greatest return of Pro Wrestling PREIOD, POINT PLANK,  💯
Randy is hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
one of the best return of the history
Top 5 greatest wwe moments of all time 🔥
I actually fell asleep and woke up when they were celebrating in the ring i never awakened so fast when his music started !!!
Seth didn't met him 😂😂
Unforgettable moment. Triple H really out did himself with this return
We want to see seths reaction
I would pay to see his interaction with Seth, lol
It's real class, cry me a river
This is exactly what he said happened. The dude doesn't lie. Doesn't have a reason to.   CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
😍finally
Chicago, Chicago, ChicagoOoOoOOoooo
This is so cool to watch
Never turn Bayley heel again. She’s too damn precious to hate
THE BEST IN THE WORLD
4:57 Bayley: “bring her in” 😁
Becky such a good wife that’s the craziest thing she knows Seth wasn’t feeling this at all so she kinda just was fence sitting in this situation
Man he looked NERVOUS.
I love how Orton has "evolved" into who he is now
❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹
I know what seth Rollins is cooking
Not to be the internet conspiracy mark or anything, but are Punk and Regal cool?    Seemed like a bit of tension
Mejor en el .mundo Cm punk
Thos behind the scenes foortages are the best I could watch hours of them and not get bored
Le plus grand retour ! 🔥
when cm punk came out huge huge pop
Prob the most epic return of all time will never forget how loud it was unreal 😨
I see Seth wasn’t trying to talk to him in gorilla 😂😂😂
Will never not be weirded out seeing Punk and HHH being cordial 😅
i love these behind the scenes videos
One of the most wholesome vidoes I've ever seen. Couldn't help but smile through most of it. This is still absolutely insane!
god this was literally the best thing that ever happened 😩 chills every single time
More BTS
This is amazing  Love this!!
Never understood how AEW could loose a guy like CM Punk. You could utilise his name in so much just by his association to your organization.
He is so fineeeeee 😍 he gets better with age!
That boi was glowing that day
Roman reings summer slam
Best return ever.
They need to do more behind the scene stuff I'm smiling so hard it hurts.
Punk would have made a great Wolverine variant......he has the look
Thank you Tony, see this is the main reason your company going downfall, you kept that irrelevant kid and you fired Punk, best decision of your life 😂😂🤣🤣
The feeling he must have had in front of that sellout crowd chanting his name, after coming from AEW’s half empty arenas must have been epic
Thank you sooooooo much HHH for bringing back my childhood hero❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just to think if it wasn’t for Jack Perry being an insensitive little boy and Tony Khan’s complete lack of responsibility, we wouldn’t have had Punk back in WWE and had that amazing feud with McIntyre.
It's so beautiful to see how happy Punk was and how happy everybodyelse was to have him back😃😃
CM Punk leaving aEw is the MOST WISE decision he ever made in his life ... Period.
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
Cm punk sucks
Ik there was alot of people unhappy with his return but I was so happy to see him back in the wwe and tbh I shed a tear.
THANK YOU TRIPLE H !! ♥️ you know what fans want 💯
Is there any doubt this is the greatest return ever?
Thank you aew for for firing and giving us back what all we waited for all those years
This is the most beautiful thing I have seen. So glad that I got to see it last year.
I was a fan of c punk back when he was in ecw and everyone disliked him after his feud with J.hardy
I can watch this video all day❤
Danke für diese Aufzeichnung ❤ einfach wundervoll zu sehen wie sich mehr oder weniger alle gefreut haben ❤❤❤❤ Danke WWE für all diese tollen Momente und dafür das man einfach bisschen aus dieser verkorksten Welt ausbrechen kann ❤❤❤❤
More behind the scenes pleaseeeee
I was waiting for Seth Rollins back stage reaction lol
50 Ads for a 10 minute video
Thanks to the Elite and TK for mending one of the most badly burned bridges in WWE history 😅
Cm punk 🎉❤
Where’s Seth in the video….
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
1976 Crash 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
thank you wwe , triple h❤
God bless Randy 😂❤
This made me so happy, last year I remember I just came from my local wrestling show and watched Survivor Series. The second the Living colour came on I freaked
the night wwe killed aew
il cocodrillo come fa
Lol where's the footage of Seth when he came through the curtain?
Look how happy Randy is 😭❤
I was there. The roof blew off the Allstate Arena. This guy next to me was crying.
You can say what you want about Punk, personally i love his honesty. I love the communication between him and Hunter, it was smooth and cordial.
Its really true. NEVER SAY "NEVER" IN WRESTLING. Ive seen some things i never thought i would think happen. Punk returing being one of them
I’m always a huge fan of CM Punk, I grew up watching him during my childhood days, for me He is the Greatest of all time wrestler always Best in the world, Love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳
still gives me goosebumps.   I thought we would see him and Rollins hugging
This is so damn dope, man.
So awesomeness WWE is the best ❤❤❤
28 is that Cedric Alexander ?😅
Id be nervous as hell in punks shoes here bro, it just looks like a wild environment especially for your first night return in 10 years
biggest shock yet as a wrestling fan!!!
One year apart and I still think this is the best return with the biggest pop of all time
The best comeback ever.
Best return of all time 😢❤
5:15 wait i get the pointy picture
The Best in The World
7:00 Randy and Phil just being boys i love
Thank you "REAL GLASS" for this , you are the best among all the hardcore objects 🥰
LIKE MUSSOLINI AND KENNEDY.
Seriously not enough too short few details
Glad he’s home
Crazy pop
This is the way "behind the scenes" should be filmed ...
Goated
کێ کوردە بالایکی کۆ مێن تەکە بکا
Seth???😂😂😂
The Moment Hell froze oder! One of the epic moments in Wrestling History!
They kept this from us for a whole year!
When are they gonna release the 45 minute long documentary about Truth returning at Survivor Series last year?
I wanna see more reactions 😭 this is wholesome, give me every backstage reactions and meeting  make this  an hour long video
CM Punk⚡ Win The Royal Rumble 🤼🏻‍♂️ and Headline WrestleMania 👑 You Deserve It 👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
Cm punk vs real glass.. That's your wrestle mania main event
I swear people in these comments are dumb af lol
I want see Seth arrive backstage  😭
I was fearful for my life watching this.
Naver say naver.
7:05 CMPUNK : "ON PURPOSE" 😂
Thank you wwe for this moment I appreciate it ❤️🤟
Chicago Chicago Chicago
OMG I have rewatched this moment a million times and it still gives me goosebumps!! Without a doubt one of if not the greatest moment in WWE history!! Punk didnt really return to wrestling until he came home to WWE where he belongs!! Thank you HHH, thank you Nick, thank you Punk!! Much love to the best in the world!! <3🥰
now lets see seth's reaction 😂
"someone" feared for his life watching this
Behind the scenes of randy orton return?
I’m mean, it’s just all golden isn’t it? Every second it gets better
This is sick
I have been waiting for this for a damn year!
Thankyou WWE for this clip
Knowing of their brotherhood it was great to see Kofi and Punk reunite. Punk was fighting back tears.
2011 I'm big Cena fan now 2024 I'm crying to see this man
Gonna see him tonight I hope Glendale
Thank you Jungle Boy!
What a moment ❤
Triple H > Vince.  If you don’t agree… THEN YOU CAN’T BE A REAL FAN!!
This will forever be one of the greatest returns in wwe history
Can someone please remind me the name of the guy in white and red costume with hat ?
Much like a good piece of art, WWE needed Punk back, not the company, the people.
Thank you for uploading this backstage video wow....this clip is box office gold....
randy crashing out at gorilla is pure cinema
randy crashing out at gorilla is pure cinema
I waited a year to see this😅
Wwe shocked the hell out of me not even I knew cm punk was coming AND U WANNA KNOW WHAT TODAY IS ITS MONDAY NIGHHHHHHHTTTT RAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
If somebody asks what moment you want to forget and relive that again, it's this one,  it was fine Sunday morning in India, 10 years of wait, no hope and this happens, was jumping up and down the whole room, damn
I could DIE happy now!!!
6:57 randy really Felt This kkkkkkkkkkkkk 2 GOATS Of The Show 🐐🐐
Randy Orton is so good 😁👍
One of the most controversial and overrated Superstars ever. Loved his return never thought he'd come back but let's be honest it's a joke what is CM punk done since he's come back the answer is nothing. Such a shame wrestling used to be good a very long time ago.
The best part about this is being able to see everyone's reaction and remembering the journey that got us here. ☝️
How many adds can you get in 9mins 30 seconds!?
2:37 hearth moves😅
Not only the fact that this is Punk coming back to the place that “got him sick” but, it was literally a last minute deal. He signed a contract THE DAY OF Survivor Series. The chances of this happening were actually so incredibly low, it’s insane. The AEW return was amazing, but you can’t discredit this one, it’s one of if not the best return the company has ever had
Goosebumps watching this
“Im not crying … your crying”😭 besttttt return of all time ❤️
I love that they have video of this
Human garbage.
Randy and kofi interaction was so wholesome 🥺🥺🥺
One of the best moments in the history of wrestling
I loved every second of this video now they should do the same thing with Randy before his return
HHH is shrinking. Punk is taller than him now lol
CHICAGO 🗣 CHICAGO 🗣CHICAGO 🗣CHICAGO 🗣
No interaction with Seth Rollins
Thanks for 700 Subscribers ❤❤
WWE can be lucky that CM Punk asks where to go seconds before. Otherwise he would have wiped out the whole ring 💥 🔥
Feeling like WWE will pull something similar this year SVR and it will be Brock return ....kinda having the same feeling
I can only hope to have the fashion sense of Michael Hayes when I am his age.
The only right thing Jungle Boy did in his career
He did say this footage will be released one day and look at this it finally happened
subtitles plss
✌🏼🇵🇾
I love everything about this!!!
Good that they kept the video of Seth hugging him off the internet- kayfabe
Cm punk nice entrance you should bring back your old music
Damn CM punk fired up that crowd like 4th of July. Wow... love it.  Also have to give the camera man, and the editors.. Good video... Good work ...
🙌🏻
Ugh, finally lol, this is the best
Top 3 return ever.   Also I like how they never showed Seth coming back thru the curtain 😂
Gave me goosebumps. What a moment to watch. Everyone backstage .. one family. I wish one day i see and meet all you guys. Man ....
Why dom looks frightened 😂
This still hits so hard. God DAMN, I'm glad he's back!
Love that reaction from Randy Orton. Haha literally waited a year to see all this build up. So worth the wait!!!!!!
Man how does a 9 minute video have 6 ad breaks wtf
Moment 🎉🎉🎉❤
0:22 didn’t realize regal was backstage. That’s crazy
All things aside JD is still there toooo😂
Es war das größte Comeback was es seit langem gab
How long will it be before they screw this up and try to turn him heel?
Welcome home Punk! ❤
This is/was one of the greatest moments in the history of the pro wrestling industry. Punk got me back into wrestling way back when he cut his pipebomb promo. Ever since then, I've  been a huge fan of his and everywhere he goes I follow. The guy is must watch TV. Would be an honor to at least shake his hand and thank him for being part of making wrestling great again. He's the Best in The World for a reason.
I will never forget Survivor Series 2023, i stopped watching wwe late 2014 due to the shield breaking up and the hype of punk returning the fall of ‘23 is what made me watch the PLE just in case and Thank God because it actually happened 😭🙏🏽
3:45 you can tell triple h puts his all in planning and running this carnival. and even on his best days like punk's return, he humbles himself, doubts himself. the saviour of professional wrestling.  well done triple H. take a bow.
Would have loved to see what happened when Seth came backstage
ok, that was pretty sweet !
punk❤
6:55
punk❤
I like how everyone’s a little awkward seeing him at first because they dk what expect but then they kinda lean in
Everyone is so damn happy! It put a smile on my face 😊
el mejor en el mundo
Stephanie finally got the handshake she never got back at SummerSlam 2011
Where was Seth during the meeting after the show was over?
Randy hahahaha
One thing I take away from this was Seth was legit pissed no work there lol. This was a great behind the scene video though.
Chicago Chicago Chicago
We want the same thing with brocks return 🙌
Pongan subtitulos en español 🙏
Wrestling is the best
ONE YEAR AGO TODAY  RANDY ORTON AND CM PUNK  RETURNED TO THE WWE AT SURVIVOR SERIES IN THE SAME NIGHT
5:13 Punk: "You're going to point at me?!" HHH: "Whatever you wanna do!" Punk: "Can I wear your blazer?" HHH: "You can even wear my blazer!"
One of the greatest moments in WWE history.
Damn, seeing Stephanie McMahon hug Punk was pretty big to see too.
Anyone else disappointed dom didn't stay in character?
I gald cm punk come back in 2023 sorry aew ya drop the ball with cm punk aew dying like no tomorrow 😂
R-Truth's other childhood hero
Thank you Trips and WWE ❤
that night i was there and right after saw him i went to sleep
Why didn't they show Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre's reactions?? 😂😅😂😅
Brother this was not only one of the greatest nights in WWE history but it kicked off the greatest period in WWE history in my opinion ❤ Nothing felt better than finally having Punk back home.
This is the goosebumps return of the decade ❤❤❤
Man, I live for stuff like this. Legitimately in my top 3 wrestling moments ever, all I remember is taking in a huge gasp and almost squeezing my girlfriend's kneecap off. I was in the middle of slapping her thigh and giving her a disappointed "it's okay" when we saw the logo drop and no Punk appearance lmao.
Where is Seth 😂
Please release the uncut, unedited version.
We The People, NEED to see Seth Rollins coming back to the room
CM punk is the GOAT mehn 😭😭🥺🥺
im crying🥲🥲🥲🥲🥹🥹
What did i just witnessed here    🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹   Hhh punk randy cody    Man this is awesome    🥹🥹🥹🥹
Please Bring back Brock Lesner !!  He can literally handle the copy cat bloodline all by himself..... and "restore legitimacy back in the WWE" as he once said to John Laurinaitis
I thought Punk wanted nothing to do with wwe when he left. Why the change of heart? Was it mostly Vince?
Who will return this year? Dean?
This was the night WWE got me back to watching weekly TV and not just PLEs here and there. You got my all time favorite back and revived my love for wrestling as a whole
Upload the tribal chief☝️ backstage footages of his return at summer slam , Awknowledge him 🙏
thank you WWE. thank you WWE. thank you WWE.
Wasn't Stephanie sitting at ringside during the show? Did she go to the back specifically to greet Punk?
Hunter is the greatest of all time
No drew or Seth
Best in the world Cm Punk
Why did they edit out Seth Rollins having a conniption?
The fact that Rhea and Dom salute him XD after what we saw in other footages xd
much needed backstage footage ❤❤
WWE best surprise return best in the world CM punk
They cut out Seth 😂
Was waiting for them to upload this🔥🔥
Five ad breaks on a nine minute video is nasty
Electrifying man in WWE ...my all time favourite CM Punk ❤🔥
This was the first time ever that iv seen stew the camera guy
Been waiting for this for a year!!
I need Seth’s backstage reaction damn it
the chants
WHAT A POP! Now that's a rock star.
Return Of The Decade 👏 WWE is the best at creating Magic 👍
The Randy/Punk feud is going to be fire when it happens. Randy won't forget he got his moment stolen.
Insane to think about what it took to bring Punk back to WWE.
Love the banter between Punk and Orton
They cut out seth coming back from the ring so i bet they shook hands but they cant show it😂
❤❤❤❤
This is beautiful.
CM Punk The Best In Word 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 , Thank You Hunter 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
6:25 - So THAT'S what Stu looks like!
Crazy it's been a year already. Where are all the stories of Punk being a cancer in the WWE Locker room?
I remember when this happened 😢😢😢 I was alone in my home watching the show and I never lost the hope. And finally I listened “Ssss-sss” cult of personality 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 was AWESOME GUYS😅
I will always love and support jack perry for what hes done best wrestler alive
Core Memory 4L
Becky was right there too when Punk came. But they didn't greet each other. Hmmm.
This was a BANGER last year cm punk return and now this year hes in WAR GAMES with the OG BLOODLINE cant wait for this saturday!
Thank you Jack perry and  Tony Khan for this beautiful return
4:17 didn’t hear about this lol!
Apparently, John Cena was there too but you can't see him....
CM punk is just a chill dude
To think this all started cause someone said "Cry me a river" 😭
But where is Seth Rollins?😂
Randy is the best :D
Best return ever in WWE HISTORY 🔥🔥
HHH peeking through the curtains like he’s a kid seeing if his parents are home, that’s great
Being there live a year ago seeing this still feels surreal.
Best PPV
Best❤
1 year later and it still feels surreal as ever seeing him back in WWE. I've loved every single second of having him back in the company and it's genuinely so heartwarming to see him enjoying it. Long Live Punk!!
I know I can't be the only one that was grinning and smiling while watching the whole video...
Seth nowhere to be found 😂😂😂
Esa es una gran familia
Wrestling fans in 2014 will never believe the journey they go on 6-10 years after the 2014 Royal Rumble. What is this timeline where CM Punk is brought back by HHH and he's hugging Steph before his return??? 🤯🤯🤯
Watched millions time this but still don't believe that best in the world in Wwe ...thnks Wwe HHH❤
I swear protect TRIPLE H at all cost! Guy got me back into wrestling
The backstage environment is soo warm heated and that's the coolest part of wwe
I was hoping to see angry Seth coming to the back 😂😂
I think once he came out and got back to the back, he knew this was the only place for him.
Marvellous! Best return ever since edge's return.
This was really hell froze over ⚡🔥❄️
I NEED MORE FOOTAGE 😭😭
Just imagine if his wife AJ Lee returns what would happens. 🥺🥺
I love how they purposely cut out Seth 😂
you can see how nervous yet so excited he is in the first clip
its just so nice to see interactions backstage man and to see my favorite wrestler have this huge moment and seeing his peers loving it brings me joy
2024 is best year for wwe in while srsly 🎉❤
Man this is so cool
It's was perfect. Perfect. Everything down to the last minute details
Best in the world 💪🏻
Hi WWE. Please can you read the new educational book called 'The Replacement People of the Bible', and see what the rabbis and priests have been hiding for thousands of years about Prophet Muhammad being prophesied in the Old Testament. Also, how the Muslims got the West out of the Dark Ages, which the Western educational institutions are hiding from people.
really wanted to see seth and drew's reactions
Micheal Hayes will always be Doc Hendrix to me. Thats how i first saw him as a kid and thats how i still see him as a 45 year old man
Imagine that the theme song was of brock lesnar
Goosebumps moment in survivor series🥵❤️
I hope dom admires punk for slapping his dad at Aaliyah's birthday party
I still get goosebumps and all misty-eyed when I hear that crowd pop for CM Punk's return.  Absolutely unreal.  The world may be messed up, but we'll always have this moment.  Thank you, WWE and thank you, CM Punk.  XXX
A year later and Punk is still WWE strong !! Best in the world !!
pfff... jungle boy cry me a river 🤣
Okay! HHH is the best thing happened to WWE!!
The Game was awesome
FINALLY
Its crazy seeing this camaraderie cuz Paul and Phil real life did not like each other. Wouldn’t had been surprised Paul supported Phil’s firing
2:49 i love hearing Triple H say “I’m serious” when he told the truck to play punks music🤣
A Year Gone Already It’s Feels Like It’s Was Yesterday Since Punks Returned Still On This Day It’s Doesn’t Feel Real That’s CM Punk Returned Home 🤩
Notice Seth didn't go up to him. Real beef??
Randy was looking JACKED AF that night! 😮
Punk was more excited to have Triple H point at him than he was to wear Hunter’s blazer.
Chicago! Chicago! Chicago!
Shoutout to my boi shouting "Chicago" while hugging cm punk, absolute legend  i imagine he still shouts it to this day
Been waiting for this footage since he mentioned it on Ariel.
The fact H knew the photo of him and punk would blow up the internet 🔥😂
6:59
who else was waiting for seth to come through the curtain
One of the best moment of the world 🌍
Now let’s see Seth Rollins’s reaction 💀
One of the Best Moments in My life 4 Ever
The only men that not met him is Seth seems reasonable
You can literally see the girl in the very first shot of the video by the curtain have her jaw drop when she saw him! And I love that you never see punk and Rollins interact in this at all to keep the small bit a kayfabe alive
When CM Punk left in 2014, I never thought he’d return home. Fast forward to 2024, we can surely say he’s back and he’s here to stay!!!
I lost MY MIND 🤗
Triple H sure buried a lot of people during his wrestling days. Paul Levesque sure knows how to right these wrongs. Respect to both for maturing.
Where is a moment between Seth and Punk!
Crazy how its been one year already since CM PUNKS return man time goes by so fast
AEW was the problem not CM punk
What song is playing behind in the start.
Legendary return of the guy! THE GUY!
@4:57 “Bring her in…” Bayley speaks for the people!
🔥🔥🔥
RKO🤝GTS bond
We want Randy Orton also, please share it, why always you sideline Randy why????
Whilst im a little old school and hate seeing behind the curtain I loved all of this. I also love the fact they didnt show any interaction between Punk and Rollins meaning this is very much still open to them having a feud and by god I cannot wait!
Bayley 🍊
Find yourself someone who looks at you the way Steph looks at Punk
Triple H has attention to the details. Everything from the match to where to walk out to, to where to stand. He knows.
LMFAO Randy 😂😂😂
Where is Rollins¡? That night was GREAT !!
Still more things will come to be happening........
5:57 two goats just warms my heart seeing Kofi  and PUNK TOGETHER ❤🐐 🐐
This is why I survived till now .
I'm not the biggest punk fan, but he's definitely brought something back this go round. So thank you AEW for blowing it, as usual.
Dominik almost seemed like a kid meeting gis biggest crush
That gorilla position is hella weird.
i hope batista watch this
That dude holding Punk yelling “Chicago” will live on forever 😂
Where’s Ryback 😂
This really shows how “Punk” he is. Complete bootlicker
Triple h making sure nothing happen lol
What an entrance
Seth is not meet punk 😢
Randy and cm punk are literally my rock and Austin from my childhood So surreal to know they are back in the same company together
I love watching the behind the scenes ❤
Hunter: you want to blow up the internet? Punk: you gana point at me 😃!?
My Dawg Bruce
I love the fact they cut seth from that for the storytelling
I can’t believe this video is 56 hours long
THANK YOU, HHH !!!!! THANK YOU WWE!!!! THIS IS THE BEST FOR BUSINESSS !!!!
Regal be like:  "Look where we stand now, boy"
I love these behind the scenes videos keep them coming
HHH said just go 2 feet in front of the cages, probably so the talent in the cage doesn't kill him LOL
Can you believe cm punk did this 3 times (this, wwe backstage, aew)
We want big dog roman reigns please hhh Sir iam a kid
Dude, I can’t get enough of Randy Orton and CM Punk together 🤣🤣💪🏾💪🏾💜💜💜
I Will Never Ever Forget This Goosebump Moment Of My Hero CM Punk ❤🫀🔥😘
Wow, look how hated that “cancer” is…
Man what a moment  With all the context of his story and the he left it seems like it will never happen  Yet here we are i love professional wrestling
Thank you junglebitch❤
Really enjoying these behind the scenes glimpses we keep getting
I just know seth went back and they hugged but it was cut for the sake of the story
My childhood hero
I love that even the heel judgment day team members were happy. So happy to have him back home
Cm punk best in the world biggest return 🥺🥺🥺💔💔💔💔😘😘😘💞💞💞😋
Reaction of the Girl at the beginning is Gold 👌🏻
My favorite video from now on ❤️⚡️🥹
They tried to matk him as the bad guy....
Love this!!!
I would love to see Kofi and Cm Punk team up again someday.
🐐
9:30 minutes is just too short need a documentary on this masterpiece
2:43 He's talking to Becky aka his opps wife 😂
Seeing HHH and Punk being friendly with each other makes me so happy, man...
The best in the world
Only person missing for greeting CM Punk was Seth. I think there some tension between the two what do you think ppl.
Absolute chills and goosebumps watching this video. Never thought I could see CM PUNK back in WWE. These are the kind of moments we love to see ❤ beautiful scenes! Thank you HHH and thank you WWE
3:55 triple h be like I want to go but I can't go man so sad
He was right about the whole being confused about the cages lmao
Shoulda showed Drew storming out
Then after years they will show Punk and Seth's interaction in this haha
We need more of this.. Cody winning the belt. Jades debut. Stuff like that
Damn you can see it all really set in for Punk when he sees Kofi that was emotional
Took them long enough to post this
Show the part with him and Seth 😬😬🤣
Rollins completely cut out of this of course. Hmm.
That was dope.  Wish they'd included more footage but i'm not complaining.  This was just so cool I wish there was more.
It is nice seeing HHH and punk getting along.
If you didn’t know any better you wouldn’t think that Punk viscerally hated this company and half the people in gorilla for nearly 10 years given how content Punk and everyone else looked before he went out
Best return in the world 🥰🥰👋
Where's Seth Rollins 😅😅😅.  Must have got Freaked out 😅😅😅
More behind the scenes stuff please . Thank you HHH Stephanie and Nick Khan. Id love to see behind the scenes of how you put a match together
Clear the hallway!!! 😅
CM Punk's return is the Greatest of this ERA ❤💯
I love you WWE Universe 🤩❤ Thanks for sharing this❤
rip for all of those who could not make it to 2024 and see Punk's return to wwe
Cm cuck
Rumor has it that Tony Khan has hit the dislike button on this video due to fearing for his life
Remember this happened because jack perry couldn't get past himself.
5:01 "Phil, you wanna go take a picture and blow up the internet?" LOVE IT
World needed Jack Perry more than they want to admit
Bayley rushing to gorilla makes me so happy
Still can’t believe it’s really happened❤ Thank you Triple H, Hunter❤
Damn. You see people running around, the Paul comes in, his shoulders are still massive!
Jim Cornette: "LIKE MUSSOLINI!!!"
Triple h last year surviour series one of the best moment in wwe ....pls this year surviour series end of the show bring back brocklesnar....that we want .....
Best in the world 🎉🎉
3:18
The Chicago dude 😂!!!
The pop as Punk's music hits is nuclear. It actually drowns out the music for a while. Simply sensational.
Triple H 🐐
Randy should have RKO’d Punk right there for spoiling his 10mins return 😂😂😂 and have fightful pick it up as punk having backstage fight on his 1st Day back😂
I think cm punk should be wwe champion now hope to defeat Cody❤
Cm Punks return was good
Why is this video 2 hours long?
Was a good event last year for all the returns. Randy's reaction in this says it all. 😅 Reactions and unexpected moments like this are what makes wrestling so good.
Had the opportunity to tell the world and he chose “CHICAGO CHICAGO CHICAGO”😂
Man i cant wait to see the real footage from Seth
CM Punk Is Looking Like Hugh Jackman Sometimes
Anybody catch what Bayley said at 3:18?
Triple H, Michael Hayes, you're the GOATS.
Michael Hayes attire is somehow the highlight of this masterpiece.  And CM Punk told everyone what happened that night to the letter and he  didn't tell ONE lie.
This is way triple h is 90000 trillion times better than Vince
Last year war games was crazy that cm punk returns and give me goosebumps i was cheering so hard i lost my voice
We would have liked to see Seth Rollins' reaction backstage.
Roman reigns return behind the scenes
These are the videos I live for as a wrestling fan ; the stuff you don’t get to see off camera .. incredible
I can't believe it's been a year already ❤
I don't hate Jungle Boy. I'm grateful that he's given us this.
I like how Michael Hayes dresses up like he'll be on TV even though he knows he won't 😂
That interaction between RANDY ORTON and CM PUNK was priceless
A historic moment in the history of wwe
Can you imagine how this must have felt for him? Like wow 😮
Cm punk best in the world
Hayes looks dapper in that white/red suit, damn!
Jack Perry is WWE's 2024 MVP
I like how they conveniently cut out any potential interaction with Punk and Seth back stage. That woud've been box office based on Seth's broken kayfabe reaction in the ring.
Where is seth's backstage reaction?
Thank you Jungle Boy
Thank you Tony Khan, you did something impossible, get CM Punk back to WWE, no one in the wrestling business could have done that
Can’t wait for these type of arenas in wwe2k
At 2:14 he was transforming right there.
This was incredible.. But now I think we need to Light It Up... 😘
Seth most likely went backstage through the crowd that night!😂😭
Beautiful
Where is seth reaction??❤
Randy is so godam funny
Yeah a pretty cool moment. I like how accommodating Trips and Stephanie were, considering some of the past issues, they were very cool here.
Forever thankful to Jack Perry.
Amazing video. I really wished to have subtitles
Seeing CM Punk hug and hold Kofi after seeing him again brought a few tears to my eyes. You can tell they are real friends, brothers and it’s like a family reunion again
One question tho. Where was Rollins?
Lol he exaggerated the events
I was mind blowing when I saw CM Punk back in WWE
Thought this video was 1 year old and that I've missed this relic for all this time but then noticed it was posted today. Damn, just watched this after another legendary Paul Heyman return + CM Punk.
Triple Surprises: Despite of everything, you came back Cm Punk: Yeah, you know what happened on that wrestling promotion, at least there is real authority, who wants a hug All of the wrestlers and employees: Me!! Seth: It should have been me!!!
When you see Punk and Kofi hug it out... 😥😢😭
Wait but where was Triple H yanking his headphones off tho 😭
I didn’t know that this guy will ever come back to wwe
Anybody kept looking in the back looking for Drew and Seth 😂
Do a full documentary please
Cause that's what's best for business
wow😊
Whaat a Moment ❤
Still gives me goosebumps a year later!
2:46  my hearts still beating anticipating this 😂 As if i was. There n not seen it
He’s modern Stonecold/Bret Hart
Heart warming maskes me smile. Thank yous to hangman page, jungle boy, Kenny Omega, the young bucks, and a special shout to Tony "I'm afraid for my life" Khan.
That was the best part about that show CM punk coming home
7:06 THE REACTION OF RANDY ORTON WOW
i love you punk
I'm curious to know from which way Drew went backstage? It wasn't from the gorilla I guess?! 💀
Genuinely cried at this.
0:46 good to see steph
If only ryback was with him
I need roman loss his title backstage
6:55  Randy Reaction 💀💀💀💀
6:55 is so funny
Number 1 moment of 2024. Period
Brock Lesnar 😢
But i thought they all hated eachother in real life? lmao love this
Paul is a genius. Man is the GOAT when it comes to storytelling and giving fans the best product ever.
Ive never seen Randy so animated!
Hell Froze Over Moment
1 year later and I remember this return like yesterday.
Dam I was hoping you see Seth come back after...
Just seeing people like Stephanie and everybody from that match(well almost everybody😅) embracing punk I smiled from start to finish
You could see the moment hitting Punk on his face. Great footage.
Wait for Seth comes in and slap cm punk😂
Best In The World
My hometown was Lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They cut out the Seth Rollins interaction backstage....feud incoming??
Stone Colds *glass break* The Rocks “if you smell” Undertakers *gong*  CM Punks *Static*  Mount Rushmore of POPs
he's too smug and arrogant for a guy that's average in every dept, UFC proved how he is below average athleticism
G.O.A.T Return Of All Time 😢
Notice colby's wife wanted NOTHING to do with him? No, how are u, how've u been? Looks like knox-lopez won't like Bailey too much.
This is so awesome  one of the best part is there is no seth and punk meeting each other
Awesome stuff
The fact that Bruce didn't blow his knees in first ten seconds of this video is unbelievable.
The best in the world
doing it for 20 years and still takes his breath away
Now that’s what you call a POP
SUCH A GREAT RETURN
Undeniably The Best!!!
Honestly wanted to see what happened with Punk and Seth backstage
Cm punk best in the world.❤❤❤
What no Seth welcoming him back ? lol
cm punk getting randy back for unforgiven 08
Him and regal really don’t like each other 😂
No randy and seth ma
Damn! We need a full documentary of before and after this day, pleeeeeeeease!!   Hunter definitely knows what the business needs!
Now this video will break the internet. 😂
Bailey tho lol a fan first love it
Orton- Punk interaction was cute 😭
I still get excited when i see this
This video destroy kayfabe
Randy is so great that he did not let Punk feel as if he stole his moment. You earned our respect Randy.
Yeah him and Seth got real life beef fr
So, Seth Rollins  knew it or what? This is real? He hates him or not? Even this video they didn't show Seth Rollins by the way they want their feud I think.
One of the most iconic returns in WWE history!! CM Punk back home 🙌
I really like this behind the scenes things so much
Thank you Tony Khan
Why this video is 1 hour long?
Moment the best
CM punks ❤
Rumours of Drew being upset was a setup to their future rivalry. Wow WWE.
I’m getting anxiety watching this lol
CM punk dapped everyone up after the return but Seth.  Real heat lol
Waiting for this Iconic Footage for the Year... 💥❤️
Not gonna lie, it still feels surreal that CM Punk is back in WWE i'm happy he is you can just see how genuinely happy he is to be home where he truly belongs.
Wow what a time to be alive. All were welcoming and happy.
And break the internet they did! lol
I've never had so many unskippable ads in an under 10 minute video.
🔥🔥🔥
Biggest Return in the history of every goddamn wrestling promotion
5:25 Imagine showing people this back in September 2021. No one would believed you.
6:55 what a fking moment❤
they didnt drew the curtain back enought to see the drew and seth one :D
Greatest. Return.  Ever.
Give us the same behind the scenes or backstage reaction when OTC returned on SummerSlam 2024 !!! Plz plz plz 🥺
Might be the best video I've ever seen WWE release
Mannnn, this put a smile on my face. Greatest return.
Punk's interaction with Becky?
whan an amazing moment it was.
No Seth Rollins footage ?
The great day last year
Welcome back home
One of the greatest moments in the history of WWE and seeing it from the other side of the curtain even a little has made my day. I am so happy for everyone involved, most of all me, because this last year, while not ideal with the injury, has been everything I've been waiting for and hoped for. I am just glad to see time healed the wounds and everyone is out making $$$. Just bought the CM Punk Belt. 🤘
He made comments not too long ago about how he was supposed to go closer to the cage, but it was too loud, so he didn't hear the instructions clearly. It did seem super loud, and the adrenaline in the soul made that seem true watching this. Still, it was perfection.
The exact moment I started to watch wwe again..
"Bring her in." That's right Bayley!! 👏🏾👏🏾
I waited patiently a year for this footage
The greatest return of all time. Still feels like a dream 😍🤩👏🏻. You just can't guess papa H
Thank you for this moment Jungle Boy!
I was hoping to see the a clip of when Bailey came up behind him and hugged him, and was like “I knew it” i remember dying of laughter when he talked about that
The roar of that crowd the second his music hits... just amazing.
My favourite wrestler ❤
Proof WWE reads the comments, they always give the people what they want!!
The moment that broke the internet. Truly marvelous. I can happily say this to my future generations that I witnessed this when happened.
I guess it really is just show biz seeing Punk and Triple H work together after they’re personal issues with each other and I’m surprised they’re not giving us a CM Punk vs Randy Orton match when Punk’s return really overshadowed Orton’s return
2:58 this was the moment as that the evening got ruined. As I react negatively to his return.
Legend was back
Rko and cm punk Convo was another level relief.
I feel awful but it’s moments like these that makes it worth living. Thank you WWE ❤️
This was completely awesome man 🔥
A day that I thought that would NEVER happen after what happened 10 years ago.  Jack Perry created the best domino effect in wrestling history.
The whole internet broke on that day! I still remember cm punk return topic was #3 top searches on YouTube for a week!that shows how crazy this return was thank you hhh❤
No hug and handshake from Seth lol
Such a legendary moment made even more familiar. It's awesome that everybody was able to patch their differences and make this beautiful moment happen! This really was what was best for business, still is!
This gives so much more context to the iconic double pointing picture. I thought they were alone in Gorilla before the show 😂
This is gift
I can’t even describe how much i missed this man in wwe for 10 years 😭 hearing cm punk chants even when he wasn’t in wwe, used to bring smile on my face ❤
2:54  GOOSEBUMPS
Seth probably went through another  exit😅
All we can say is THANK YOU JACK PERRY
Love Bayley and rhea, the warmest people and Dom getting the instant respect ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
OTC
They didn’t show Seth walking through the back lol
Stephanie and Vince hug and smile the same exact way
everyone forget that they didn’t show seth and cm punk meetup nice nice 😂
They are totally different person behind the curtains ❤😅
HHH 🤝 Punk ❤
All this because someone wanted some "real glass"...😂
CM Punk Cm Punk CM Punk!!! 🙏🏻🙌🏻
On this glorious day I’d like to thank Drew McIntyre for putting him on the shelf for half of the last year 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⚔️
Yeah, the first 40 seconds of this video is exactly why I never believed the Punk/Regal heat a while back.  What a damn joke the dirt sheets are.
Static CM PUNK + Cult Of Personality = AURA
0:03 Security Girl's reaction
Legendary moment ! Hello from Russia 🇷🇺
Still Unbelievable Cm punk Returned To WWE ❤
I was witeng this video year ago😍😍😍😍😍
I died with Iaughter at Randy Orton's feigned anger. 😅
Put Randy ORTON & cm Punk in 2025 hall of fame
Cm punk look like Tony stark
Backstage pass prices are gonna go through the roof keeping this type of content up
I loved Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Bayley's reactions to CM Punk's return.
1 year ago
WWE Survivor series WAR GAMES cm Punk 2023 😂😂😂 Seth Rollins 🖕🏻
Is this world peace?
Next is lunatic fringe DEAN AMBROSE  BREAK ALL RECORDS OF WWE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Triple H pulling his blazer closed like yeah I just did that shih
THIS IS EVERYTHING
128498th view ❤❤❤❤
I don’t mind 2 hour documentary about this on Netflix 😮
5:08 and that picture actually blew the internet 😂🔥❤
I REALLY GOT 3 ADS IN A 9 MINUTE VIDEO
This makes me happy bruh. I remember being a heartbroken kid when he first left 🥲
Love to see how Phil and Paul seemed to be interacting and working with each other here
Finally we got this video
“ARE YOU GONNA POINT AT ME?!?! I’m gonna get the pointing picture?!?!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Feel bad for Randy, he gets slighted a lot sometimes lol he’s definitely matured a lot though
Seth Rollins really hates him or what? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
the best in the world❤️
CHICAGO! CHICAGO! CHICAGO!
They didn’t even show Seth in this that’s how you know his reaction was real😂😂😂
The PLE was already so well done, punk returning was just the cherry on top of the best hot fudge Sunday you've ever had
No Drew or Rollins 👀
this is the pop he got in the wwe knowing he already return in wrestling in aew......now imagine if he return straight to wwe.........add the pop he got in aew and this .......for me he derves to main event mania wat i mean is not night 1....the real main event give it to him he deserve it
Cut damians part mann 😂 i saw him then it cut
I WAS THERE!!!! ROOF BLEW OFF THE PLACE 🤯🔥🔥🔥ANOTHER HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE BEST WRESTLING CITY 👏🏾
If WWE did  not have Paul(Triple H) as CCC  it would NOT be as incredible, as hyped, and just storytelling.
Possibly the Best Ever Return in WWE!! 🔥
So funny when he sees Dom lmao dude was prob like 10 when he last saw him
I wanted to see Seth’s reaction so bad lol
Randy's reaction lmao 😂
you want some video to your ads?
❤😢
He's obviously happy not to be working around children anymore.
Y pensar que el contrato se firmó solo horas antes del evento
♥️🔥
The day f'n HELL FROZE OVER!
It’s just still is crazy to see, and seeing Trips and Punk hugging is so awesome, considering how they left each other a decade ago, seeing everyone so happy to see him man it’s awesome
2:57 loudest pop ever in pro wrestling history 🗣️❤
i cant be the only one saying WHERE WAS SETH?
Still thanking jack Perry and Tony Khan for this.
2:56 🎉🎉
So he shook Stephanie's hands knowing where her hands would have been
why did they uploaded the video after 1 year
Great job cameraman 3:19
Why does Michael Hayes dress like a pimp from the '70s?
CM Punk looked better with this haircut.
Was wondering if they were going to show Seth Rollins in the back welcoming him. Think that would ruin the rivalry that’s to come in 2025.
Randy’s reaction 😂😂😂
Where’s Seth?
I love that Triple H said "Hey, let's break the internet with a picture."
I loved this video. But I really wanted to see a interaction between Punk and Becky, cuz they are my faves and she was right there 🥲
I'm cryinggggg 😩🥹🥹
I remember absolutely hating this lol! But... I gotta say, It's been a great year with him back.
Bully Ray vs the miz
JUST LIKE CM PUNK DID !!
Triple H has made WWE great again, now everyone wants to come back, next big return, Sasha Banks
They cut out the Punk and Seth embrace😂
So, Seth ran the other way to avoid Punk at gorilla.
Still gives me chills
❤🎉❤🎉😮😮😮
Cm punk
Take notes, Tony Khan. THIS.. is what professionalism looks like. THIS is how you treat people within a business.
Your Jamaicin me crazy!
The greatest thing Jack Perry has ever done
One of my best thing happend and still can’t believe he came back🔥
So no Rollins Punk interaction? Keeping that lil bit of kayfabe alive damn.
6:12 One of the greatest commentary duos ever
*Bro, I waS drinking my tea and when the muSic hit, I Spilled the tea all over on my bed 😂😂😂*
Thanks for 72 Subscribers 😊👍🏻
*GOOSEBUMPS* 😭❤
Give me the documentary
It's been a year, huh?!!
CM PUNK IS TRP 🔥
Where is seth,,, he was hided  from backstage,,,
Don’t ever anyone tell me wrestling is fake.
I didn't see Triple H throw his headset...
2:56  the moment you've been waiting for
Gee, wonder how Seth was feeling about the return? 😅😂
HHH peeping in the curtain trying to get the feel of the arena is mad love fore the business
من اجمل العودات ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The night that broke AEW fanboys Mentally and Spiritually! 😂
WWE one big company can also make a mistake it's 2024 survivor series।।
9:31
No handshake for seth or drew backstage...editors you did your job well
HAHAHA Randy is the best!! No one can hate him
I'm so glad he stood in front of the shark cages 😅
5:55 no Seth embrace 😬
9:00 “CHICAGO CHICAGO CHICAGO “😂 🔥
Can’t believe it’s already been a year! The greatest return in WWE history imo 🔥
Them cutting out the part where him, Seth and Becky hug eachother is classic 😂
Bro everyone was soo happy to see Punk. This return still gives me chills to this day 🥶
Thanks for sharing this with us WWE. Truely shows how things have matured for everyone. Shows how time away can really change people. This is a business, and both sides know they can cash in this opportunity. Glad to have Punk back home.
Iyo was right about Bayley 😂 “I need a f’n beer hard”
The greatest return in the professional wrestling history 🥹❤🎉
💪🏾🔥🔥
The crowd reaction to 7:25 ❤
I laughed so bad 😂 at the interaction between CM Punk 🤘 and Randy Orton , their reaction was hilarious 😆!
We al wait 1 year for this backstage video finally it came ❤
🙋🙏🙏🙏🙏👌👍😘
The static of cult of personality always gives me goosebumps
Seeing cm punk back in wwe still feels so unreal 😭❤
I wonder what Seth’s reaction was when walking past Punk in gorilla 👀
Was there. No words for how electric it was.
The Night Hell Froze Over This Is Still Sereal To Me Man His Interaction With Both Triple H And Stephenie Are Really  Showing Me How Things Have  Changed Since He Left In 2014
I was there that night, not many people actually believed he would return
Still can’t believe I was there.   BEST IN THE WORLD!!!
Any Students 😅
Now what would make this return even bigger.. if he came out with the world championship with the X.
Kofi and Punk 😭
About time
I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF THIS! ❤❤❤
It was worth waiting almost 10 years for this moment. A year ago I was finally happy again, a year ago hell froze over
Le monde  entier  a du voir  cette  étranger
Show Becky welcoming him back but not Seth? THATS ALL WE CARE ABOUT
Did y’all put enough ad breaks in this video?!
Never thought I'd see the day cm punk would walk out of a Wwe curtain again..but life is a funny and mysterious thing
2:56 Chills! welcome back Punk
Thank You To the Empty Headed Dumb Fvck's Adam Page and Jungle Boy 😉
It’s so odd how unreal the feeling is of him coming back to WWE. To think it’s been a year already just goes to show all the great things that have come.
I believe they cut where he sees Seth backstage 🤓
tony khan "i feared for my life"
6:57 RANDY'S REACTION "CAN I NOT ENJOY 10 MINS OF MY RETURN"
man .. i luv seeing the OGs behind the scenes doing their thang... and triple H  is LOCKED THE EFFF IN ...
Wow was he nervy or what haha
That was awesome
The Best In The World Makes Best Return In WWE Ever
this is the best return ever to wwe
4:29 VETERAN OFFICIAL CHARLES ROBINSON
Can we just have a second to talk about what the hell Michael "ps" Hayes was wearing! Wtf man lol
Still seems awkward with Regal😂
1 year later, hasn’t punched anybody he wasn’t supposed to or choked anybody, he’s finally in the type of promotion he wanted to be in a decade ago. Despite a major injury he’s had feud of the year. No dramas whatsoever….. funny that. Almost like he’s not the problem. Good to see him at the top where he belongs.
I was there live in the arena. The pop for CM PUNK was just something else. Never forgetting that night!✌🏼
cm punk cm punk thank u triple h
needs aj
I felt goosebumps watching the best in the world come back. This is the happiest thing that has ever happened to me while I'm alive. I can die in peace now.❤🙏☺
It was phenomenal
he did not meet and hug seth rollins.....was interesting
CM PUNK AND JEFF HARDY 😂🤔
I'm not crying you're crying
Insane reaction.
This is sooooo amazing 🔥 would have loved to see Seth and Drew but they can’t do that. Gotta keep Kayfabe alive at least a bit. Great footage of an amazing moment.
damn it’s been a year already ?
They had to cut the bit where Seth is throwing up in absolute rage u_u
Cm punk  et le meilleur
Thank you wwe for bringing back my fav wrestler 🔥  Been watching him ever since he was in the the indies ROH style 💯
Finally the moment I was waiting for.
Guys,We wanted to see in ring instant reaction of those guys when the music hits.
All The Best Cm Punk WWE 💪💪💯💯
"CHICAGO CHICAGO CHICAGO" that dude was hillarious xD
this is so sweet omfg im so glad he returned 😭😭
I was there in Chicago that night...my buddy and I were making our way up the stairs to leave & then his music hit...when I tell you our ears almost went deaf when the crowd exploded...good god it was a moment in time 😭😭
Thank you Bryan Danilson
Seeing this is giving me all the excitement again along with the warm and fuzzies. Thank you, Tony!! 😃
5:46 is that one of the guys from J&J security?? Wow lol
Why didn’t Seth come
C'est  le meilleur  au monde
0:32 Okay, punk over-exaggerated that when he told the story. The way he told it, I was expecting a full-fledged argument.
1 year later, I am watching this at 01:42 and I see Punk's stress and now I am stressed even though I know the outcome
It’s a crime that this isn’t an hour long video showing punk hiding backstage and then sneaking to gorilla
CARELESS 061 - ALKA SELTZER ❤
The best for business!
If u had goosebumps then hit a like
This two goats return on same night and it's been year now man how time flys by 😢
i feel like the moment cody and cm punk nodded and said " oh fancy seeing you here" "you too" tells a vastly deeper story then we know
This Is The Unbelievable Return Ever Happened In WWE 🔥🔥💯
Steph was there! Cool!
Makes me want to see a full show but just showing Gorilla Position, behind the scenes of all the little things that make a show happen.
Triple H peaking out the curtain like a proud brother to see the moment was just the icing on the cake.
Had Punk and Corey Graves made up at this point or did they make amends after Survivor Series?!  Presumably Seth blew straight past him when he got to the Gorilla position as well like McIntyre apparently did!!
i'll never firget this moment my whole life
You could tell Becky couldn't care less backstage because well her husband lol!😅
Seth didn't returned to gorilla until the backstage was cleared? Or he took the other way out?
I love these behind the scenes clips
7:06 the reaction of Randy wow
wwe literally hired the guy who choked another employee at another company, but no one cares.
2:16 pure excitement pure joy on his face is undeniable.  Kid in a candy store. Glad his back home where he belongs.
Listen closely but you can hear the moment during that return is when AEW began to die.
I just love when they show the backstage area before they come out too the arena then they get in full character mode after or that just me!?
If you really think the grass is so much greener on the other side that be my guest main event night four on a buy one get one free extravaganza
I haven’t been this shocked in decades watching a WWE show.  So thankful I got to see this as it was happening.
I was in the building that night and everytime i here his song it brings me back.
This also proves that these dudes will always choose money over beef. They were all happy to see him for the most part.   Also cool seeing dudes like Michael PS Hayes still in the business.
Really wanted to see the clip of Bayley bearhugging Punk from behind that he talked about 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Triple h has taken wwe back to almost untouchable imo 🎉
He’s a different man now, being back in the WWE has rejuvenated him.
Triple nose 👃 sucks
Please bring back dean Ambrose 😢
7:30 this one if them NBA moments when they say, i get it now! This looked planned into everything came back at war games but , back for pay back for Paul and signify his legacy as a Paul heymam man as well for a win one last time ??
Still gives me goosebumps. BEST IN THE WORLD!!!
LMAO Randy’s reactions 😂😂
IF BROCK LESNAR RETURN IN SURVIVOR SERIES 2024 IS THE BEST RETURN OF ALL TIME
5:54 men the look of  rhea
Thank you HHH ❤️❤️
This is a career defining moment for CM Punk. A man synonymous by the chants fans would give, even when the man was nowhere to be seen in any arena at any show, gets one of the biggest pops of 2023 after 10 years of being away from WWE. This truly proves without a shadow of a doubt that ANYTHING is possible within this new era of WWE and professional wrestling as a whole. A year later and I still get goosebumps. My throat still sore and my body still restless. What a night it was and what a time it is to be a wrestling fan.
Seth was very angry in that moment  7:25 😂😂😂😂
4:08 "There was nowhere else to go." Well, he'd have looked good with the Bullet Club in NJPW.
Anyone else not turn off their tv yet just cus they had that strange gut feeling your eyes just couldn’t stop
"We'll Talk" Grown men putting their differences and old drama aside to make money and entertain the millions...and millions.
CM Punk's return tops Edge's in 2020
I’m so happy they finally released the footage of Punk’s return backstage. You can see Punk’s emotions while he was saying hi and waiting to go out. Plus since WWE is showing us now after a year since his return means one thing in my opinion. Punk is going to win the Rumble and finally main event WrestleMania
I loved it. One of the greatest & most unexpected returns in modern pro wrestling history. SPEECHLESS! ♥♥♥
This is absolutely beautiful 😢
wish it could be longer It's happy to see him back to where he belong💪🏻
Seeing how Punk being excited and nervous for his return to WWE while have words of encouragement by HHH and Steph. No one thought this say would come. The fact the company and Punk managed to buried the hatchet to the point Punk loves working with WWE shows how much HHH changed the company
I was there. The ground was shaking. I’ve never heard an arena get that loud
I want full night videos atleast 1hour video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best in the world😎💥
Punk knew what was the right thing to do
Love seeing my hero Regal in gorilla.
I was beaming like a child watching this footage so wholesome!
❤
Love seeing this!
Everyone is there except that freak.... The one who is not man in his own house
this fire Burns best than cult of personality
I just wanted to see Kofi & Randy’s reactions Bayley’s was a plus
Randy being Randy for few seconds 😂
6:55 "this is why look like randy's reaction for the first time" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you, HHH for this moment!
"Where tf do I go?" -Punk
i have been waiting for this video for so long and it is really worth it 😍😍 i enjoyed every second of it ❤️❤️❤️
Oh come on.....no Rollins footage??? 😂
Mahn, it still feels surreal ... These behind the scene footages are 🔥 ngl.. !!
Was a die hard punk fan growing up and when he left in 2014, I quit watching wrestling all together.. 10 years later he’s back and wrestling is great again. I don’t care what anyone says, to me he truly is the Best in the world
One year later, same feeling!
They really need to upload Seth Rollins pissed off when Punk return
There is no one like him. He is a once in a life time talent.
The Man, The Myth, The Legend...CM Punk...
Nice to see WWE bringing backstagestuff
show us Seth’s reaction backstage😂
Were him and regal a bit spicy? Didn’t even say hi haha
Punk: We get to point at each other? LOL
Ofcourse this is fantastic to see CM Punks perspective on this incredible moment, But Honestly seeing William Regal back in WWE management alongside his best work colleague is fantastic 🙌🔥
Randy orton returned  Cm punk returned R truth returned at survivor Series 2023
Lo unico bueno de ese evento zzz De hecho fue lo unico que vi
Fun fact, Jamie Noble beat CM Punk for the ROH Title back in 2005, so it was pretty cool seeing them interact backstage during Punk’s return.
I was hoping we would get more Seth reaction content
6:55 BEST MOMENT XDDD Gotta LOVE Randy
I must have missed Seth Rollins back there congratulating and welcoming him back.
Anytime in his absence punk could do tht
Arguably the best night in professional wrestling
No welcome back from Seth? lol
Still a crybaby know-it-all hypocrite who starts arguments he never wins & leaves
Im crying me a river of JOY that punk is in wwe and their doing good. But crying me a river of pain that aew is not the same! 😅😂
I still get goosebumps
❤ we love cm Punk
I wanted to see Seth’s backstage interaction too 🥲
Wow this fast as hell i remember hearing punk describe this situation that he was just in the guerrilla position for mins before being pushed out and even Bruce and them saying walk out straight😂😂, I'd be nervous reck damn
7:00 seeing these two hug after watching their feud and nexus so long ago is almost surreal love to see this tho man 2 pillars of my childhood 💯
This all comes full circle to him returning at survivor series war games to being in it the following year its crazy how the world works.
Triple H will forever give me trust issues, when it comes to the copyright logo at the end of a show. It's not been done a lot, but enough to leave a lasting impression.
Still gets the goosebumps whenever i rewatch that return
Last moments were so emotional how time flies 😢😢
He said  hey to everyone  except  seth rollins 😂😂
They really uploaded this????!!!! Lets gooooooo!!!!!!!! Man we really missing Vince, If he was in WWE this couldn't happen!!!
Was waiting for Seth Punk face to face 😂
Look at that.  No petty jealousy, all smiles and congrats to Punk. This is the difference between a group of professionals and a group of amateurs.
i know im not the only one going back and watching him return still
Punk & Paul Heyman together🤨🤨🤨, Heel Turn incoming
Can’t believe it’s been a year already
The one hug they left out was with Seth! 🤣🤣🤣 gotta keep that feud looking real. Lol
The fact one year has gone by is insane. He went from a "never back to WWE" guy to having MOTY at HIAC. Phenomenal career. Can't wait for Wargames this year 🔥
EPIC, BEST RETURN EVER, 2023 WILL NEVER BE THE SAME ! CM PUNK WRESTLER IN THE WORLD !
Greatest return ever 🙌
Epic. Goosebumps every time.
When the crowd is louder then the music you know you have done something right...
After seeing this I’m convinced that Seth Rollins crashing out was real asf because I saw everyone else in the back except for Seth 😂😂 he really hates CM Punk fr
This is so nice... To have this all recorded. It makes me happy.
I will watch it everyday, thanks for posting this❤
What a vid!!! So glad vince is not here anymore
CM Goat
Dioooooos❤
Who else saw that girls face in the very beginning of the video? Lol
Cm punk is back thats enough to me ❤❤
Probably the GREATEST Return ever
The best thing about time is it freezes for a moment
For me, the most emotional reunions for Punk were with Kofi and Corey. Knowing the story of what happened with Corey and Punk to actually see them reunite and now being friends again is amazing. Also, with Kofi. Kofi said in an interview that even if they dont speak no more, Punk is always going to be his brother.   Man, what a moment?
1 YeaR already 🤯🤯🤯
Need a reality show of everyone being buddies backstage.
Cody and Punk a Little AEW Good to see you😌
The biggest butterfly effect in wrestling starts here, if this didn't happen, Cody wouldn't have finished his story, we would have had a The Rock vs Roman
I think all we need now is a Seth and drew POV
CM punk❤❤❤
What a moment 🔥 🔥
Him and Kofi was a good moment
Your company reshling fake or real I never mind but I need brock the beast love for India
You see things like this and wonder: how can you not like that atmosphere backstage? Looks so cozy. Really hope to see more of these things
3:17 my favourite moment
On this day last year
Imagine that, CM Punk backstage footage that can actually be uploaded on YouTube.
Note the absence of Seth and Drew when they all welcomed him back backstage - obviously could have been edited out, but I choose to believe they in fact did not welcome him back :D
This is AMAZING to see. Im not a CM Punk fan at all but this was him loving life and being very scared. WWE is doing great things. This is now pro wrestling 2.0 🎉
The greatest moment ever
I hope Dom was still in character 5:56 lol
This never happened with vince
The goosebumps I just got from watching this again!!!
Love they are keeping some kayfabe withSeth
They didnt show what we really wanted to see... Drew and Seth backstage afterwards.
I don't care what anyone says this is the best return ever John Cena Royale Rumble has lost its spot
He arrived Not even 5 minutes before he came out
Notice no superstar was hurt backstage during filming
I couldn’t stop smiling during the entire video!
Over hyped 😊
Damn, was hoping we’d get angry Drew McIntyre and Seth Rollins reactions 😅
Best RETURN of all time cause he's "THE BEST IN THE WORLD"❤💪🙌😎🥶
Now i know early 2010 was the best era of wrestling imo
Everyone was glad at Punk's return........................................... EXCEPT Seth "Freakin" Rollins, HE WAS MAD AS HELL
Definitely the BEST WWE moment 2023 !!
One year has passed but Punk's return still gives me goosebumps...that was awesome!P.S.The loudest  and most emotional "It's clobbering time"EVER.
this was perfect ❤😭
stuff like this shows how this business is so special man, I’m so grateful we live in a timeline where wrestling is at its best!
Imagine if Seth Rollins would've entered back from there and the Staredown lol
The only person not shown in any of this… Seth Rollins, I wonder if they did have a moment backstage and will one day release it to us
Watching the return live was insane! Was denying it up and down for weeks and then he comes down the aisle i still couldn't believe it
CM Punk fans 👇🏻
CM Punk is an amazing fighter.
“Good seeing you here.”
He didn't shake Bobby roode's hand lol
Seeing everyone show love to Punk backstage makes his return 100x sweeter.
7:24 something we waiting 9 years to hear again. Still getting goosebumps. CM Punk. The Best in the World back in WWE. A fever dream right ?
Notice they avoided to show Rollins reaction backstage
Welcome back Home Punk
I can't believe it's been a year already.  Time flies by so fast.
Ohh man what a moment ! 😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
Free palestine. !🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
THE moment I became a fan of pro wrestling.💪
The GREATEST return of the Decade Yeah?!!
Next week need John Cena and CM Punk backstage at Mania 40
Punk and Orton talking again backstage must have felt good, seeing them hug is awesome to see.
I’d like to believe there was an interaction between Seth and Punk during that time and it was just cut for future storyline purposes
I would have liked to see Seth's reaction backstage.
i called it when that press release was put out and i was about ready to admit i was wrong when the static hit.  and a year later it is still so awesome had had indeed froze over.
Time flies so fast man because, we had got 3 returns in one night Rtruth Randy Orton and CM Punk crazy that this was all one year ago
You had to be there when it happened whether in crowd or tv. One of the most must watch moments in professional wrestling history
This was cinema  we was waiting for  cm punk  to return to the wwe  he came back one year later  he in wargames  to fight
There is a reason we didn't see Rollins but one day we will see that 😅
If u want something said, ask a man; if u want something done, ask a woman..
WELCOME BACK CM PUNK!!!!
What a moment! Still gives me goosebumps.  Punk❤
I could watch a 2 hour documentary on this return alone. Him seeing everyone, the pre/during/after.... I hope this gets to 20 million views, so that they do it.
behind the scenes of Roman Reigns's wwe return at SummerSlam 2024
Punk and Ortons interaction had me dying, lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love CM punk🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man, how awesome it is to see The Best In The World back home 💙♥
I wanted him to meet seth
I can’t be the only one 🥹
Chicago, Chicago, Chicago.  CM Punk is Chicago's own and a proud son of the city.  I love this man!
❤
I can’t wait for a cm punk documentary all the  bts are gonna be fire
@2.58 what does Punk say to Becky?
The crazy thing about this moment is that I dozed off through half the match and woke up for last 5 mins I’m finna gents and that got damn static hit I lost my mind I’m ngl the greatest return ever we really thought we need see this happen
I can't express enough how glad I am that Punk came back. Watching that return and the love he gets from his peers gives me the chills every time.   My daughter and I got to meet Punk at Fanfest NYC, and he was one of the biggest guests of the whole event.   @Wwe, please give me a heads up next time Punk will be in Austin, TX for Raw or Smackdown. 😉
kofi and punk hugging brings me joy
The ads are strong in this one
Happy one year Anniversary CM PUNK❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊
Randyyy orton
Randy Orton lol😂
❤⚡💛⚡
The funniest is that they were red hot before his return and then it became more flames after like what a moment seeing it
Then look further than WWE
I am still smiling 😊.., may be this is an ordinary return for some people.. but for me personally this the biggest return of my favorite wrestler...which i was manifesting from many years when this person left this company.., i still remember my childhood.. how i'm searching on the internet news about cm punk returns.. but i always be sad and thinking why he  is not coming for us, but finally never say never becomes true, he listened to his fans and HHH make it possible... , these are one of the memories which i will take to rest of life ❤😊 thank you CM PUNK you are the real Best in the World❤
Thank you Tony Khan
The best return ever❤
I had to wait way too long for this!
They didn’t have Rollins reaction   Maybe there was real heat  Would be nice to see
The night we Seth crashed out 😭💀
If you want to watch garbage wrestling
I have a crush on her Liv Morgan & Bayley she is my girlfriend Liv Morgan Bat Girl Kimberly Pink Ranger & crush I have a crush on her Liv Morgan
No a single interaction with Seth Rollins... You know what that means folks... 😎
People can say what they want about Cm Punk, but his returns to AEW & WWE changed the business.
Thank you Our Tribal Chief Jungle Boy Jack Perry 🫸🫷
This is called QUALITY CONTENT 💯🔥🔥
Cm punk Best in the world 🌍😮❤
You simply can't dispute the fact CM punk is up there with some of the biggest and greatest wrestlers of all time. That roar of the crowd from Gorilla was insane!
So I guess Seth was actually angry on his return, even behind the scenes he never came back to gorilla. I don't think they get along well how are they gonna work together?
Aaron John Cena Randy Orton Shawn Michaels Seth Rollins Cody Rhodes Cmpunk Alodfo Torres Kaylee Mena Aj Lee Savannah Gomes Becky Lynch Liv Morgan Bayley Alexa Bliss Tiffany Stratton Alicia Renteria Michelle Rivera Agata Nechtcheret
I like how even in this we dont see Seth at all backstage when everyone else was coming back from the match
The greatest behind the scenes video ever!!!!!!
Still feels unreal! Randy had the best reaction! 😅
Didn't punk say that it "was so loud he couldn't hear where to go so he was gonna walk to the main cage"... Clearly that's 🧢
The best thing about time is it changes ❤
5:07 you wanna post picture and broke the internet 😂triple h said it so easily
Still cannot believe I was there to witness his return to WWE after 10 years! My voice was so shot that night lol. Took my wife, my brother and his girlfriend for the 2-day package and we had the time of our lives!
Why didn't Seth walk in through the curtain with Cody and company 🤔
This is The Mona Lisa of WWE returns.
One year ago I was proven wrong when I thought bringing him back was a horrible idea , left hand up my bad
Before This Day Over Behind The Scenes CM PUNK 2023 Survivor Series Return Will Have Over 1 Million People Watch! ❤
*Real* *Glass* .  And the rest is history.
Not showing any interaction with him and Seth is criminal! LOL
This video shows how fake WWE is
One word. Iconic.
My brother had an eye operation doctor advised not to watch television or mobile for 2 days but when he hear his music he just can’t stop himself .
This video deserve millioner wievs
6:20 Rare Stu sighting!
I didn’t see Seth and punk backstage lol 🤷🏽‍♂️ I still think he was really pissed
I can bet that Dominik at 5:51 still hasn't forgotten what Punk did to him and his family
That was incredible
They turn the cameras off when rollins came back through that curtain 😂
next one please of brock lesnar backstage at summerslam
Best behind the scane video thank-you wwe 🔥
Waited for this video a year
WWE is trash
Only thing that would have made this better, is if Paul would have let him wear his Blazer…
Cody saying "good seeing you here" 😭😭
The best video I’ve ever seen.
CM punk you're a piece of garbage so you belong in WWE
The greatest  retuen of aal time
one of the greatest nights ever in the wwe and truly an unforgettable moment
+
The way WWE cut off Seth from this video 😂😂😂
No greeting from Seth? Also, Cody looked, rightfully, disturbed.
The fact that Punk was literally talking to Becky Lynch when his music hit is glorious lmao. Don't show this footage to Seth.
LFG
Feels like yesterday. one of the best survivor series moment. CM Punk is an emotion.
The DON Tony Khan fired CM Punk😂😂😂 AEW is destroying WWE!!!!
I'm came here for making money
Punk and finn 2 pro shaking hands thr
1:05   That man is making WWE great again!!!!
cinema ✨
The greatest return of all time the best in the world CM PUNK 🔥
Seth Rolling 😂 man of character 🔥
Come on Punk, why did you shake Stephanie's hand? You know where it's been lolol.  All seriousness tho. I'm happy the guys back, and had a good trilogy of matches so far... after seeing this you can tell he isn't as much of a "cancer" as some people make him out to be.  Heck, people said Graves and Punk had beef....and they shake hands and hug after seeing each other backstage haha
افا ليش ماسلمت على بيكي
Ortan 😂😂😂😂
Thank you Jack Perry
Happy One Year Anniversary To The Best In The World,The Real OTC Of WWE, The Real Tribal Chief Of WWE ,Chicago Illinois Finest And Greatest Ever To Do It In Professional Wrestling And One Of The Greatest Wrestlers On The Planet Mr. CM Punk!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The khan family owns a NFL TEAM  and they always fumbles the ball ...   STILL GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS ONE YEAR LATER WHAT A RETURN   PREDICTION HEYMAN AND PUNK WILL DESTRUCT THE ORIGINAL BLOODLINE..   NOT A PREDICTION   ITS A SPOILER
I provide wrestling updates on my channel ❤
Thank you triple h for making this happen 🙏
Full circle this is crazyyyyy
Been waiting to see this for a year and it's so good to see Best return of all time also love the fact that picture was triple h idea
Best move WWE ever made! So happy CM Punk is back home where he belongs
I hope wwe back again brock Lesnar return because we want Brock Lesnar return in wwe, this is best for the business @tripleH❤
That little interaction with cody "hey good seeing you here" really the best move both of them made coming back
Proves that all the reactions that were recorded from peoples phones were works. 🤣🤣
Chicago Was Nuts Last Year Return Hometown Favorite CM PUNK & This Saturday Will Be CM PUNK 1st Ever WARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR GAMESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MATCH! ❤
I remember I was about to change channel at the end of the event and out of nowhere Cm Punk music starts, my girlfriend was next to me and I was almost crying of how excited I was, that return stop the world of a couple minutes, we all wanted to comeback but deep inside of us we knew it wouldn’t happen and Triple H shocked the world with this surprise, one of the best moments in WWE history… will be watching this Saturday ✊🏻❤️❤️  Btw, that moment between Kofi & Punk 🥹👌🏻
I can't believe I live long enough to see CM Punk hugs with Stephanie Mcmahon and shake hands with Triple H!🔝🥹🔥
Stephanie repeatedly touching Punk with "the hand" (if you know you know) has me 😂😂😂😂. She finally got her payback! 😂😂😂
One of my favorite returns ever
What an amazing birthday present last year!!! And I can’t believe it’s been a year already.
Top 5 return in return in the history of professional wrestling
We were all waiting for Seth coming back in Gorilla reaction weren't we?😂
Johnson
CM Punk over the years   2021 - returned to Professional Wrestling   2022 - got injured and out of action for nearly one year   2023 - returned to AEW Collision   2023 - got fired from AEW   2023 - Return to WWE
Being in the building for that was an incredible experience and one I’ll always be thankful for
So AEW was the problem, CM Punk there was the definition of the word problem, now in WWE he is completely changed and has matured quite a bit.
One of the times I wished I stayed home from the bar with friends to witness this epic return on tv instead of my phone. Held my beer with my mouth open the whole time with my friends not understanding what was going on 😂
Surreal... WWE is best at creating the moments .  Punk fan for life❤
Where is Seth😭😭
Can’t believe it’s already been a year since this super crazy moment happened. Time really flies by so quickly.
I never thought that Punk would be back in a wrestling ring again. But him returning to the WWE is something that I've never imagined, especially the manner of how he left WWE in the first place. I'm sure that many people have said this but once again, Thank you, Jack Perry 😂
3:13 Diddy in the back screaming
LOVE From Bangladesh
It is always amazing to watch Behind The Scenes videos, God bless you WWE ❤
Where are drew mcyntire and seth's backstage reaction 😂
this is awesome ❤cm punk return in wwe ❤
Bro is tobey maguire
Do people really care about this bloodline stuff? They should just have their own show or something, it eats too much time out of smackdown. That's why I stopped watching.
I am waiting for Seth Rollins vs Cm Punk at wrestlemania 41,it is gonnabe goosebumps for me🔥🔥
This literally broke the internet, I a going to watch it again, then I am going to watch the one on SD live with the Bloodline
I wish they would’ve showed his interaction with Seth
No hug from Seth ? Ahahahah
Paul levesque deserves his flowers
❤
It's insane how this lines up with how CM punk describes this moment on the No-Contest Wrestling Podcast
Still a surreal moment. Also, I hope him and Corey buried the hatchet fr.
Seth was pissed when he came back
Creds to Tony Khan for building the bridge that was destroyed 😂
This was awesome to see! Much appreciated wwe
Nice to see Triple H doing a good work
The day hell froze over
CM Punk returning in a plain white shirt lol
Another backstage story that Punk told the truth about, almost word for word. That's pretty elite
CM punk is getting stomped this Saturday huh!! They are really leaving too many easter eggs in this video..😂😂😂 one sweet curb stomped to cm punk  at survivor series.. 9:01 shout-out to Chicago guy !!!
The greatest WWE return ever
Waited a year for this lol. Slow.
Randy 😂😂😂😂
Finally I've been waiting for nearly a year for this
😍😍😍
If CM Punk's return was impossible and that dream was achieved, I also hope that when AJ Lee returns to WWE they record his return behind the cameras ❤❤❤
another day of thanking Tony Khan 🎉
why wwe keep showing this ? well i know to build feud to seth at wrestlemania 41
He certainly went back to work after his return. Just had one of the best feuds with Drew and now him being in the bloodline story because he's a Heyman guy..
where is seth and punk hug 😂😂😂😂
I got goosebumps watching this. This is what wrestling truly is.
Hell Frozen
Pure joy, thank you so much WWE
Most crazy moments in wwe history ❤
Paul really said do you want to blow up the interent punk said ohhh you will point at me damn i love paul❤
❤❤
Just THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!
Cm punk Randy Orton having the greatest reunion conversation hands down, you hear nothing when after his music hits insane pop
💩💩💩💩💩💩
Only drew and seth avoided him hahaha
Cody and Punk just saying "good seeing you here" after finally being out of AEW
For us who grew up in the 2000s and I was in HS during the Summer of Punk. this was surreal to watch. Soured by how he's behaved and some of his actions, but still a surreal moment nonetheless.
Randy is so wholesome! 😅
MADE US WAIT A WHOLE YEAR BUT LETSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (434)
For someone who supposedly ruffled a lot of feathers, there was a ton of genuine love for CM Punk being back in WWE. He got so many hugs, handshakes. Vince always used to say he did things that were best for business. I think it’s truly HHH that does things that’s best for business. Developing a friendship with the Ultimate Warrior and bringing him back before his passing, meeting with Jesse Ventura and healing that relationship, working with CM Punk, respecting the legends, building the woman’s division, HHH is just fixing all of Vince’s past mistakes. It’s so refreshing to see!
CM Punk & Randy Orton are truly Bros🤣🤣
0:19 punk was breaking the ICE saying “ Where tf do I go?”
Probably THE biggest return in wrestling history 🔥
Seth acted a fool in the ring and they didn’t show him coming to the back lol. LOVE IT!!
Gosh I love these backstage moments
Needless to say, this was a "moment" in time; the audience was so loud that they drowned out his music. Kudos to WWE for capturing this footage for posterity.
Was looking forward to seeing Seth's reaction behind the scenes. Also Punk is the fifth man for Roman's team at wargames this year. Punk just ruined Seth's survivor series wargames for the second time in a row😂
its funny that seth isnt there to meet him lmao
THE BEST RETURN IN THE HISTORY
Maybe the greatest return in the modern era of wrestling. That pop was a sonic boom. An emotion. A feeling. CM Punk, welcome home. 😊❤
3:26 Bayley 😍😍
I'm a sucker for behind the scenes video and I've been waiting to see  this for a year ❤
5:07 “wanna take a picture with me and blow up the internet?” Trips knows exactly what he’s doing😭😭
Thanks WWE for showing us this side of things ! Good to see
No, you’re not the only one addicted to re-watching this.
Already at first second you can see in the background the shock on the workers face as Punk walkes by.❤
3:36 he’s looking at him like he is his kid.
Triple wanted him to just stand before the arena but the crowd pumped him so much ....he got emotional....n the guy chanting Chicago was best part ❤
I love that they edited out the part where Seth came backstage
Freaking Orton man 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best thing I have ever Witnessed. Omg
Still remember it like yesterday!
Still feels surreal after a year! Hell really did froze over 😭🥶
Very cool ... the cuts when everybody came back backstage was because of Seth and Drew who shouldnt be seen with him at this point.
i started watching wrestling again after this return, i tuned in every week ever since. I AM NOT HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS, I'M HERE TO WATCH WHAT'S PAPA H WILL BE COOKING
"hey Phil u wanna take picture and blow out the internet"😂😂😂😂😂😂 Man seeing punk ,  triple h went from being top leader to one of the guys again........ This shows that WWE is fully behind punk and they might have put rocket behind his back to make him one of the top top guys if not the guy...... Survivor Series will lead to something big.......
No one is eye rolling telling him to hurry up or at least are smart not to film that part
Did Seth not walk back from Gorilla? Would love to see the stare
This shows that you can always mend things if , ONLY IF YOU YOURSELF want it. And now look at CM Punk, Triple H, William Regal, And Corey Graves. All have mend the fences. Not just from a business perspective but also on a personal level. Even Rollins and Punk are working together now. Roman and Punk. Look at it. How mature talks can change the course of the entire industry.
6:46 "Let's blow up the internet" They sure did 😂
The "I was dumb enough to think we'd get to see him and Seth and expected Seth to know the cameras were there and keep kayfabe" button
2011- CM Punk and Triple are enemies.  2024 - CM Punk and Triple H are friends.
Cm🫡🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Get ready for the beast  return
lol i was hoping to see more seth reaction
Wwe what means???
Tuve la suerte de verlo en vivo por TV, ojalá pueda verlo en un show en vivo.
"Just when they think they've got the answers, i change the culture."
CM Punk is home ❤
This feeling can never be replicated
This was the worst return besides Roman reigns period
The bond in wwe ❤❤❤
6:56 Randy’s interaction with Punk is the freaking best 😂😂😂
Damn he even hugs steph ❤❤
Absolutely wholesome.
AAAAAH 1 year later and still getting goosebumps!!!!! Thank you HHH 🫶🏻
How comfusing is it to know where to stand? CM Dunce lol.
I literally dreamt of this moment, CM Punk's return last year was legendary. This was some truly awesome Behind the scenes footage. More of this Please!
Becky in backstage next too cm punk
I love everyone reactions backstage this is easily one of the greatest wwe returns of all time and easily in my top 3 wwe personal favorite returns of all time. I remember thinking damn it’s about to end and there’s no Cm Punk return then all of suddenly hearing his music and just going crazy while also becoming emotional. Like you don’t understand Cm punk is one of my favorite wrestlers of all time he’s easily in my top 5.
My channelllllll 🎉
I was shaking watching him standing and waiting in the gorilla 😂 Best return ever!
Waited 10 years for this moment as a fan.…I’ve gotten married, had kids, and bought a house all between Punk leaving and returning. And in all that time, I waited for this moment. To get this behind the scenes look at it, makes it all the more special! I love when wrestling can give you these moments, even still as an adult.
I never thought I would ever be able to see Punk live, back when I started watching his stuff from the past once he quit WWE in 2014. I never thought, that I would see him go back into wrestling in 2021, and all the controversy, that followed ever since. I never thought, that I would have another opportunity to see him after he injured himself at the Royal Rumble. And yet back in August 2024, at Bash in Berlin I absolutely demolished my throat, singing Cult of Personality at the top of my voice with 15k other wrestling fans. One in a lifetime thing (because WWE is gauging us with prices so high, I'm not planning to attend any event in the next 5 years :V) to experience. Thank you Punk.
Who dat in da white suit
Waited all year long for this….
Punk: It happened so fast! Delusional me: Expecting 1H 19M BTS 😅
This return was so unexpected and awesome at the same TIME. I WAS SCREAMING LIKE A MANIAC WHEN PUNK APPEARED!   THANK YOU TRIPLE H, GRANDE SEÑOR TRIPLE REGRESOS 👏🏻
Funny how we didn't get Drew or Seth coming through the curtain  Keeping kayfabe alive!
The Best Moment In 2023,Welcome Back BITW 🔥
Seth is a crybaby Lol
Thnk god
Man prior to this very moment I just did not think this man would actually return to WWE. But im happy he’s back and is finally ending his career home.
The best brain of WWE
Becky Lynch was in the gorilla room, she had to be a little uncomfortable that Seth wasn’t in the know of this
Ok vote in the comments, Cm Punk vs Edge return
Amazing. This is why i love Professional wrestling
The heels all broke character lol and I was legit waiting for Seth to come in
That Randy-Punk moment man. My inner child is so happy.
Randy Orton in the end is priceless. The day he retires will be one of the saddest days in wrestling.
Sure Seth is firat guy disliked this video 😂😂😂
One of the TOP moments in WWE
He looks so happy. This is really great to see.
I loved how everything was played out, waited until the very last moments for Punk to come out, the logo at the end of show was on the tv screen and all the sudden Punks iconic theme plays and the crowd goes nuts
Its irony how this backstage Documentary vids have more views compare AEW match video this week
Why Seth Rollins hate cm punk? Give me reason
I love professional wrestling
I’m here for Bayley
One of the best returns in wwe History by a mile 1000%
Awesome stuff
Wasn't Seth Rollins shook hands with CM punk backstage?
Punk should have said the next night: "I'm not here to make friends, everyone loves me already" 😅
C.m punk has always stood out as a lone wolf i love that about him he stands on business and this moment  right here will always be a big deal ❤❤❤❤
Just think WWE recorded this 1 year back and now they are using that footage. So think WWE is recording many other things which they use later for storytelling or behind-the-scenes.
Behind the scenes this is awesome!!! 🎉❤🔥
Cm punk happy I am happy❤
so cool for WWE to show this. its awesome and wholesome to see.
need a Behind the scenes of randy orton return suvivior series 2023
Jesus I’m nervous as hell watching this I can only imagine how punk felt
This was awesome.
That smirk on his face 2:59 😏
This could never happen under Vince thank God trips took over it and gave us a gift
2023 - made an epic return to WWE at Survivor Series 🔥🔥🔥🔥 2024 - join forces with OG Bloodline and going to face new Bloodline at Survivor Series 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful
Best kept secret
The best thing that has ever happened to vince McMahon, is having paul Levesque as his son-in-law...
The best 9 minutes of my life
He did say this footage will be out soon enough 🎉🎉🎉
I can’t believe it’s been a year since cm punk made a shocking return to wwe at the end of survivor series Wargames. This year, he’ll be part of team OG bloodline
1:58 lmao this was the part when HHH and the rest were freaking out whether Punk understood the instructions😂
This feels right ❤️💯🥲
Banger
Literally everyone in the match congratulated Punk on his epic return….   Except Drew and Seth 😂😂😂
Sheesh BAYLEY 😍
This moment feels like it happened yesterday
Randy Orton has me cryin 🤣🤣🤣
Wonder what he said to Becky lynch , you can see they had a moment 😮
For all the money he's got, TK couldn't pay this many people to show up and give a reaction like this. Absolute magic.
Thank you Sir HHH and All WWE Group 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Greatest moment ever cmpunk is just that guy
Notice Drew nor Seth showed up to say hi
Se dieron cuenta que Seth Rollins y Drew Mcytire no lo saludaron?
HHH is catgorically assiduous in every move of CM punk where he stands
The best thing that ever happened to WWE, was Vince McMahon letting his son in law in charge.
now he almost has more returns than terry funk
I'm so glad Regal was there.
2:16 That is a look of a man that is just genuinely happy to be home.
Best entry forever❤
THIS IS AWESOME! ONE OF THE GREATEST RETURNS IN WRESTLING HISTORY!
where is Seth's reaction lol😂
When I saw this, I started sweating, my heartbeat increased, and I shook. I don't know why, but it's a strange thing great video
What a return 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 but Royal rumble return could’ve been perfecto 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Best in the world ❤❤
this video debunks all the dirt sheets 😭😭😭
This took me through such an emotional roller coaster. Such a special moment that I and many fans will never forget. Thank you WWE and thank you CM Punk.
Its still not a bigger pop than Edge at Royal Rumble but i guess im over being bitter that he's back after seeing this... Yes WWE im a CM punk fan again...
🐐🔥
Cm punk return wwe best gift to wwe fans who miss cm punk 10y
CHICAGO CHICAGO CHICAGO
When hell froze over. What a moment. Welcome back, CM Punk.
Randy look happy 😂😂😂
Finally!! we get to see how it all unfolds
This was absolutely wholesome ❤❤ Punk having a time of his life meeting everyone  The last Randy and punk interaction was epic😂
I was waiting for these footages since punk mentioned them during the rich eisen episode
becky knows this will hurt seth hehe but theyre pros after all, i think seth walked out in different place not in backstage. didnt see him.
CM Punk, in an interview, said some day WWE will release a video or a footage of the bts return. and boy oh boy did he and WWE deliver that promise!
Greatest return in WWE history!
Clear message by @wwe Seth Rollins will cost CM Punk and OG Bloodline the War Games. There's not a single footage of Seth with Punk.
the rest after this happened, history
Biggest fan childhood dream to watch wwe live in stadium I hope someday it will come true
tbh they ruined it . for randy cus of punk
😮everybody said hello to Punk except seth
Bayley running to Gorilla to greet CM Punk 🥲
1:00 look at the goosebumps coursing through Punk, he knows he’s about to make history. Oh and they really weren’t lying at all when they said that this was last minute 😭
Tears in my eyes to this day
Would have loved to have seen Seth walking back through those curtains. Really wonder what the interaction was like
Man Seth must really have issues with him, we never see them together backstage after the show. Not even a handshake.
Nice ❤❤
This was a wonderful treat for Survivor Series week.  This moment will always stand out as one of the greatest moments in WWE history.
Chant ❤ cm punk all tym 🎉
Cm punk return was fire I lost my stuff hhh cook
That smile at 2:19. He knew right then and there that he’d made the right decision.
2:44 Becky waiting for Seth ♥
BEST MOMENT FOR WWE
The Reason WWE will always succeed better because Triple H knows the business and entertainment POV, THE WRESTLER POV THE EXECUTIVE POV AND A FAN POV  and a family man he's been all these things.. Which makes the company a better work place because he understands the passion of each Pov.. I didn't even know he created most of our favorite angles. BRAY LANTERN FINN BALOR CRAWL and more..  He's goat
the best in the world ❤❤❤
video about to have one-trillion views.
the moment we all been waiting for for 10+ years
PUNK!!
And he's wrestled like 4 times since. All the hype for a washed up man
Did anyone noticed that Triple H feared for his life the whole time!! Lol
I love that we get BTS footage of this.  Everyone going crazy for it is so cool
Wanted to see Seths reaction but he ducked lol
5:50 Dom reminds all the flashback meeting with CM Punk
I havve to say something. Under Vince Mcmahon I got bored with WWE. You jknew what was going to happen weeks before it happned. Under HHH it is no longer boring. I mean they even use fan footage now to ser up fueds. I mean the who CM Punk Seth Rollind fued dtarted with fan footage
It’s all about the game & how you play it. Imagine this time 10 years saying that Triple H & HBK would take over WWE & bring back CM Punk
Randy's Reaction to Punk bring tears to my eyes, these men made my childhood Awesome!
I wanted to see him hug Seth Rollins :(
You can post otc return at summer slam
I’m just so happy for Punk
3:24 Bayley and CM Punk always show love to each other 🥲
Haha Randy.
I was there it was the hugest and greatest pop I ever heard !  The greatest thing that has ever happened in wrestling !!!!
He was nervous af
Se ve tan guapo jajaja y no soy gay jajajajajja CM punk CM punk CM punk
Becky  welcomes CM Punk on the other side. At the same moment, Seth wants to fight him 😂😂😂😂
so glad I bought tickets last minute
He's so nervous
now give us Brock PAUL GIVE US BROCK!!!!!
It’s nice seeing backstage relationships.  Randy is funny
I love this version of WWE, showing behind the scenes of some of the most crucial moments in WWE history
4:56 Punk: “I’ll do what I can, you do your job and I’ll do mine.” Bayley: “I will!” That’s AJ Lee they’re talking about. 😊 Come back soon, Queen!  Edit: WELL, HERE WE ARE! 🤩❤️
A certain company has never been the same again since Punk came back home...
Let's break the internet  Best in the world ❤
3:47 i think triple H was sh*ting in his pants thinking of Seth Rollins reaction
Becky Lynch was not thrilled with Punk's return. And we know why.
After CM Punk's return, nothing is impossible in WWE
Love CM PUNK from India
I got chills at that pop, only thing I ever heard that was louder is when quezzie burnt rolled in 97 in The Swamp.
Thought WWE would cover this on a separate Documentary, Glad they shared it here🔥
Notice there’s no interaction between Seth and Punk👀
the video we been waiting for
At this moment backstage when cm punk is getting ready to go out is like kid on Christmas morning getting ready to see the Christmas presents under the tree
HISTORICAL RETURN🔥🌟
Is there an ad break every 30 seconds or what?
Would have loved to see Drew and Seth’s reactions 😂
While I’m watching this I’m getting hype even though it happened a 1 year ago
Best return in WWE history.
1 year later, same chills
I was waiting for this footage, from last year
no moment with Seth lol hahaha!
Im so grateful my tv remote ran out of battery I almost missed this magical moment
Wow time so flies that Pepsi Phil returned last year. Glad he’s at peace right now with the company. Welcome back to the big leagues.
Where is Seth backstage?
I have to see him meeting Seth for the first time since his return
now do Randy Orton 👀
Welcome back home!🙏
3:19 thank me later
I like how they purposely cut off Seth coming back to gorilla to keep that kayfabe
Beautiful.
this was cool to see
been waiting for this footage for a long time...welcome home CM Punk!
Still doesn't feel real. But good god, I love it!
I remember jumping out my God damn bed at like, what, 5am UK time or God knows whatever? This moment re-re-reignited my love in wrestling to another level. My GOAT, my fave, my hero. And to think I got to meet him and tell him how much me and my sister love him, and he said "appreciate you guys!"   Man, I love pro wrestling.
Just the greatest comeback in the History!!!
05:12 "Oh you gonna point at me?" - Hahahahahaha
thank you jack perry
Hii @wwe @tripleh sir We also need a behind the scene of Roman Reines, that too of SummerSlam 2024
Cm punk return confirmed.
rip aew
One of the most epic nights we have ever seen in professional wrestling, his return after almost 10 years and what a way to reflect it  Regardless of what happened in the other pond, there is no denying that the impact of the Best in the World is considerable.
This.. is The Place to Be. Professional. This... show... Everything that other company doesn't had.
I like how they made sure not to show any footage of Seth or Drew meeting punk backstage. I’m sure there is footage but atleast some people keep kayfabe alive
6:54 Randy to Punk: Can I not enjoy 10 mins of my return?!😂😂
You can see how happy punk is to be back in wwe with everyone more comfortable with triple h
Cm punk Chicagos Goat
5:13 "Are you gonna point at me... Im gonna get the pointing picture!" 😂
I still get goosebumps after re-watch ❤
No seth there 😂
Love to see him back ❤😊
this is so special. i was waiting for them to show seth’s reaction.
You can tell Willam Regal has an issue with CM Punk here
That’s why we all say Today “THE BEST IN THE WORLD”🙏🏻🇮🇳❤️
6:55 Punk and Randy's interaction 😅
The greatest return ever
Man. I still remember this. It was just a few months after AEW All In and after he got let go/quit. What a moment
Rollins the only one who didn't congratulate Punk for his return lol
I really wanted to see Seth's reaction backstage 😂
Very Good so Lovey🥰
One of the greatest moments of ALL TIME! 🙌🏼
I love that girl at the back right at the beginning when CM Punk walks by her. Her expression is like "WTF?" 😂
Te quiero mucho CM Punk ❤
Clearly we didn't get Seth's reaction when he came back to the gorilla position. Which means they're keeping everything at bay to make this rivalry well alive for Wrestlemania next year. I love it!
it was cool to see Dominik's reaction
This still feels unreal….
Cinema
What did punk say to becky before he went out?
Grinning from ear to ear watching this entire video!! ❤
The best in the world ❤
The best return in WWE history,no debate
No Seth footage? 😂
He look so nervous
6:57 Randy was NOT HAVING IT🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seeing Addonis with a headset is cool
AEW SUCKS  ❌️❌️⚡️⚡️ The BEST IN THE WORLD is back home where he belongs. 💯
Best moment🔥
06:55 This is perfect 🤣 Gotta love this!  Let's hope we get the Orton X Punk official reunion in the ring someday!
Legit didn’t this coming especially after everything that was said & done just after Punk left in 2014 but it’s so good having him back
5:08 TRIPLE H WITH THE W AGAIN
I can't believe it's been a year since CM Punk returned to the WWE. Still doesn't feel real man.....
Randy so happy for punk ❤❤❤
I've waited for this footage for a whole year. Welcome back GOAT.
No Seth 👀
So glad this happened, what a moment, thank you Cm Punk & Triple H
It's felt like Punk just returned yesterday. How is it 1 year ago that Punk returned? Time flies!
Just Like Yesterday WWE Survivor Series playing On My TV 😮
The best returns are the unexpected.  🔥🔥🔥
🎉Qué momento más épico🎉 CM Punk 🇨🇷.
No CM Punk Seth Rollins interaction 😂
Seth Rollins not being backstage truly speaks volume
How many time can you watch this 200 times ? More 300 times ? More 500 times ? Probably 🤠
Cm punk fans  👇
You can literally feel the atmosphere backstage as some mishap gonna happen. Hell froze over. 🥶
Cm punk ❤ the best in the world💥
6:55 Randy Orton’s reaction is everything🤣🤣🤣
Dominik's looks when he saw CM Punk 😁
Seeing CM Punk so happy to be back in the WWE and seeing him with his old friends while meeting new faces just brings joy to my heart. So happy to see him back!! ❤❤😀
But he’s a bad man he beats everyone up and make them fear for their lives get the hell outa here such a wholesome video
"Oh, are you going to point at me?" lol he's so naturally funny 😂
That moment at 5:20 is one for the ages. The looks that say it all
One of the best returns ever. Goosebump moment.
Aw he looks so nervous
Cm punk greeting randy orton so good
I hope Punk thanked Cole for holding Seth back lol
No sign of Seth Rollins…   But absolutely surreal night, trademark logo fooled me once again in THE BEST way!
Surreal.
"there's 2 shark cages get in the middle of them" "gotya" *instantly forgets*
Love this love everything about it. Love his interaction backstage with everyone. Would have been interesting to see what Seth and Drew did but can't have everything i guess but this is great to see Stephanie too. Seeing him with Kofi was great and same with Randy
all hail the best of the world
Triple H: 👈
Everyone present there is really happy to have Cm Punk back. That day was so special as a Punk fan.
I was there, there aren’t words to truly encapsulate just how I felt when the static hit, for whatever reason I decided to stop recording after the match when they were mulling around, and I missed the moment, but I managed to record just before he walked out, it was an out of body experience, one of the best nights of my life
seeing punk & kofi man 😢
That dude yelling Chicago with his arm around Punk is forever GOATed
Best return of all time 🔥
1:19 Punk near that WWE logo must have been surreal
CM punk is back 💪💪💪💪
I’m guessing Seth didn’t come to the back until he was told Punk was gone from the area 😂😂😂
Jey Uso behind the Scenes next please
I think Dominic still have PTSD with CM Punk when they meet after long time😂
They literally destroyed dominiks character within few seconds….he looked star struck 😂
6:55 😂
you can see how nervous and exited he was, can't believe it's been a year
I'm loving these behind the scenes stuffs, WWE! 🙌
I'm just happy Punk had the chance to patch things up with his friends, and now they all are working together again. Not everyone has that opportunity.
0:53 Punk's look is like "WTF is Hayes wearing" lol
Randy's reaction was the best! Cracked me up.
greatest return ever
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is biggest reaction for a return I have heard in a very long time
Really wanted to see Seth be like “ahh welcome back brother” 😂
I'm remembering all the emotions and feelings I went through last year. Pessimism, Denial, Shock, Hyperventilation, Realization, and best of all, PURE JOY. I'm still feeling the joy a year later.
The exact moment Pro Wrestling regain its peak
All time great CM punk return 🎉❤
Can’t believe it’s already been a year. I’m glad he’s back for good.
Do they just pay Prichard to walk people to gorilla??
This is why “E” is number 1.
History
Wow how could y'all keep this locked for a whole year this is insane footage
Love this! GOAT
This is so heartwarming to see all of the stars and crew welcoming him back. Love these BTS videos from WWE
CM PUNK CM PUNK CM PUNK
You know you got a good thing goin on when the scream is louder than the entrance music. Wow goosebumps!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Waiting for Dean Ambrose return like this
I wonder where is seth when they all got backstage
WWE forever ❤
Cm punk was actually nervous at the beginning I guess he was wondering how everyone would react or just the jitters.
I been waiting for this since they talked about this moment on ice cube son’s podcast
yehh we need more of this bts stuff its the best
Punk, looked nervous excited whatever else he was feeling ❤ This is cool thanx for showing us  Appreciate it 🙏💞
Best thing to happen in this decade
Cm punk the guy who for 10 years has spit on the wwe met who doesn't say no to a big contract. now that he is in wwe he criticizes AEW. the guy is the biggest hypocrite in wrestling
WWE is the best
Amazing footage. We were supposed to see this earlier this year but then he got injured. Better late than never.
My jaw dropped like hell when this happened.
Im convinced Punk slayed Bayley. 🤣
This will always be INCREDIBLE!!
Who is the guy in the suit explaining everything to punk ?
look only seth rollins didn't come to meet him
Best Return Ever in survivors series
Only thing that would’ve made it better is HHH’s music hitting…. Him coming out and shaking Punk’s hand live on PPV. You think Seth was pissed before??? 😂😂😂😂
I wondered when we'd see the backstage footage. The pop when the static hit really blew ALL the roofing off
6:55 LMAO
No Seth damn
Cm Punk: I'm just a wrestler  Me: Thanks for changing my life.
Thank you for keeping Seth’s reaction away until a real documentary about this comes out
Steph finally washed her hands to shake Punk's hand after all those years lol
Drew and Seth wasn’t really happy at all seeing CM Punk returning to WWE. 😬
The security guard in the beginning was the best part 😂 she was all of us before even we knew
I mean not all behind the scenes were shown with Seth but it can be shown once the feud is over.
Where was Seth?????? 😅
Notice that no seth or McIntyre
I wanted to see what happened when Seth walked back through the curtain.
I’m sure it must haven been a bit awkward for Seth to walk back there and see Punk. Too bad we couldn’t see that lol
Drew Mcintyre left the ring after match, wonder what happened when he spotted CM Punk
The best part is that we didn't see Seth hug Punk. Keep kayfabe alive, bay bay!
7:00 Randy Orton is amazing 😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:44 j and j security. I thought they left happy to see them😢
6:55 This was a funny part
I love Randy coming back and messing around with him   "Can I not enjoy ten minutes!?!"
I will never forget the day I was in that arena heard the music and since then get goosebumps everytime I hear Cult of Personality
❤❤❤🇧🇩
Randy's reaction had me dying 😂😂😂😂 @6:55
I wonder what Seth did when he got back there😂😂
I noticed that seth and drew weren't there to meet him . These guys do have beef😂😂😂
6:24 So THAT'S Stu the cameraman who John Cena talks to everytime in his entrances! 😲
wholesome moment
I'm a man of great discipline,"I don't drink, i don't smoke, i don't do drugs... my addiction is watch all CM Punk's videos"
GREATEST RETURN OF ALL TIME
one of the greatest returns
They deliberately didn't show Punk Rollins hug guys 😂😂
where is seth rollins😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Cody finishing the story was incredible but this is the greatest moment of the HHH era.
Seth Rollins missing 😂😂😂😂😂
The camera work in the Triple H era has been amazing
One of the greatest moments in WWE history 🔥🔥
I love this backstage moments hope wwe upload more this type segments ❤
It is such a treat to be able to see this helluva experience from backstage, I literally just re lived and it was amazing! 😊👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I Love Pro Wrestling. I Love WWE
finally
Fantástico regreso
Shown everyone meeting CM Punk backstage but not Seth Rollins thats a clever way of storytelling
Best version of CM Punk 2011
Randy pretending to be mad😂😂😂😂
FML. whos cutting onions?
It's great to see him thriving and WWE Backstage being proud of his accomplishments. 🥹❤ CM PUNK CM PUNK
15 year old me would’ve never thought he would come back. I felt a shock through my whole body when I hear the static.
He is my childhood favorite wrestler and seeing him back in wwe and that too what a phenomenal run he is having just make him wwe champ soon
We need more bts in wwe
🫶🏻
I watched CM Punk walk out of WWE when I was 10. I was in college when I seen dude come back. Unreal.
6:56 LMAOOO😭💀💀
I love how this gives context to Punk's story of being totally confused on where to go and nearly botching the spot by going ringside.
I had adverts for this, that felt longer than the video 😢
2:16 that smile. Awesome 😁
The moment between Punk and Orton, pure gold😂😂😂😂❤
Randy's reaction is hilarious
LOL 6:55 when Randy complained about not even being able to enjoy his return for 10 minutes before being upstaged. I do wonder if they'll eventually do a angle with those two.
Seth didn’t even say hi to him 😭
Didn't know Rush was this hyped by Punk's return.
✨Clear the halls ✨
5:44 Note:- Seth Rollins and drew McIntyre are the only persons who haven't hug with cm punk!
Wwe best return I ever seen
That Pop 💥
although this stuff is great, a part of me doesn;t want to see all the hugging backstage. There's still a real backstage reputation that CM Punk has, and its better to leave it a mystery as to whether CM Punk is welcomed back stage imo
I like that they kept out Seth's interaction backstage just to keep kayfabe xD
Cm
Damn Steph was present also during his return😮😮
Nice bro
I love the fact that they didn't show any footage of Seth Rollins when both teams went backstage.. I don't know if he went right after anyway or not, but let's keep the kayfabe alive, LET'S DO IT AT MANIA
Both him and Randy Orton return was incredible. Thank u, Papa Triple H. For this moment, what a hell of an event can't wait for this war game
This is the greatest piece of video ever YouTubed.
That pop... Never Gets Old! Welcome home CM Punk!
remembering this day. i was not able to watch the PLE Live. i was about to come home riding my motorcycle. when this moment by posted by WWE across their social media i’ve got goosebumps ! and mindfuck while im driving. thankyou is not enough Triple H !
One of the greatest if not the greatest return in the history of wwe
Epic moment!  I was the one saying no way in hell he EVER comes back to WWE. I was wrong and it was glorious!
0:44 I’m surprised Stephanie was here backstage that night I thought she quit WWE her job on January 2023 but she’s Triple H’s wife so she can come if she wants.
Paul "The Goat" Levesque
WWE held onto this footage for a year and it'll probably do bigger view count than the original return. HHH is taking us to the promise land, boys.
Everyone exept Seth hugged him when they came backstage, hmmm "I Wonder Why" 🤔 🤣🤣🤣
Watching  Dom being himself is really cool while his character is the most hated
The Seth Rollins comments 💀
Who else remembers Seth’s reaction? 😂
The greatest return in WWE history along side Edge’s
Lmfao i love that moment between Orton and Punk.
Im still can’t believe
What a moment, I stopped watching wrestling in 2014 because he left and started again in 23 because he returned, never thought I'd ever see him make up with triple h and stephanie
I still get goosebumps from this WOW
This video just brought smile on my face
I love this, incredible behind the scenes look!
I saw him win his first title in wwe , winning his first mitb his cashin on edge , him vs Cena in mitb 2011 him vs taker at mania 29 him leaving the company and coming back what a ride it has been ❤
Have a feeling Seth Rollins will be getting into the cage to take out either CM Punk or Bronson Reed for the Bloodlines Wargames 2024
It is actually a thanksgiving gift even for indians
Bayley always curses like a sailor when she doesn't know she's on camera.
Thank you (hhh)    I stopped watching WWE since WrestleMania 29. Now I'm back to watching wrestling and especially the goat cm punk 🔥🐐
Good to see Steph beside triple h. Awesome couple❤
CM PUNK NEED TO WIN THE 2025 ROYAL RUMBLE AND MAIN EVENT WRESTLEMANIA 41
The best birthday present ever I’m happy he’s home
2:55 The best moment of all time
now show Rollins’ POV
Why this video only 9 mints?!
Every thing this man do is a cinema going down to history
I wish they showed Seth's reaction backstage after CM Punk's return
The thing that was NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, happened. One of the greatest wrestling moments in history
I love seeing the behind the scenes stuff like this!
Orton😂😂 love that guy
Thanks Tony khan 🎉
I like how they didn't show Drew McIntyre or Seth coming through  👀 It's always the small details
Best Return in The World ⚡✊🏻
I remember losing my voice in 2023 when punk returned o well it was worth it
Finally THE video. ❤
No sight of Seth…
FASCINATING to see just how legitimately "LAST MINUTE" this all came together!  NO REHEARSALS and they are literally giving him direction just minutes before he walks out!   I'm happy for Punk that he's now somewhere he's APPRECIATED and not dealing with Middle-School-Elite-Drama.  Good to be with Leaders that matter.
I want Seth and punk footage
I don‘t know why but I like every interaction between Cm Punk and Stephanie McMahon
Watching it live was spectacular, can’t believe it’s been a year
And I got to tell you It's perfect   perfect.Everything to the last minute details 😍😍❤️❤️
Bayley is an absolute mood here lmfaooooo I NEED TO HEAR THIS
Where was Seth when everyone was coming back from the ring saying hi? 😂
This made me so happy, though we need extended footage at some point, The buildup and aftermath. Awesome seeing Punk back where he belongs and more importantly happy, he deserves it.
always love these bts clips, best in the world is back
Randy is the best! LMAO!
All the goddamn ads in this video, I’m sure YouTube is cutting them some nice checks every month. Like 7 10 second ads for a 10 minute video, Jesus Christ!
There are only a handful things in the world that are surreal on both- at the stage and behind the curtain.  This is one one of them☝️
7:00 "CAN I NOT ENJOY 10 MINUTES OF MY RETURN" 😭
Interesting
Best return of all time… CM Punk is the goat 🐐
This is amazing, it’s great to see more of one of the best returns of the modern era. I remember that night and I couldn’t believe it. Can’t believe it’s been a year already
Real Glass Cry Me A River
Got goosebumps again just watching this
BEST IN THE WORLD!!!!!
Time to clobber
5:25 Punk: “Hey! Good seeing you” Cody: “Good seeing you HERE” 😂😂😂
So glad both CM Punk and Triple H put their past issues behind them and are working together again on better terms. 4:06
Someone gonna talk about how former rivalries & foes punk and hhh are showing so much love to each other and seem to be getting along
This was so cool to watch, he was so nervous backstage but man its great to let it all out & be accepted back home after a period of time at "daycare." Ready for Wargames!!
So glad cm punk is back home, WWE is the only promotion he needs to ever be in, other places don’t deserve him
HHH is just a different type of leader. Vince and Tony for different reasons could never.. just looking how involved he is. From the NXT days to now just working on a different level
Still one of the most shocking returns in recent memory! Wwe is his home
3:19
Watched this whole thing with a big grin on my face that hasn’t gone away
3:17 Gyatt Damn <3
Thank you for uploading this!  Punk is my modern Stone Cold, my GOAT
I love seeing the behind the scenes stuff like this!
I will forever have the honor of saying I was there live for it🥲🥲🥲🥲 please take me back
I think the best part iss randy literally saying "BRO YOU CUCK MY POP! " 😂
Very heart warming to see CM Punk backstage I’m glad they released the footage one year later
Cannot believe this was a year ago. When WWE itself changed.  Life was fkn crazy when this happened broooooo
Bruch Pritchard is definitely giving Oswald Cobblepot
6:59 Randy cussing at Punk 😂
Really awesome. Keep doing this.
I hope this shatters some credibility of those wrestling accounts where they said HHH cleared out the room lol
Finally WWE released it when We Need the Most Anyways cant believe people lost their mind just exactly 1 year ago
The night AEW fell off
punk and randy is so wholesome
Where's seth Rollins 🤣🤣🤣
Is that Bobby Roode?
Thank you Jack Perry 😂
Randy busting his balls but still being professional had to be my favorite part
Wholesome content. You can see Punk was really nervous. Awesome moment.
I wish they would’ve showed Seth coming down into gorilla
Nothing is topping these return ever
my favorite night in wwe🔥🔥
Great to see Punk, Hunter and Steph have buried the hatched, they are all older and wise now lol. Punk has looked so much happier since coming back too, hoping everything goes well for him and everyone.  Randy's reaction was perfect lol
Moments 🥰
CM Punk returning to WWE was best for business looks like hell froze over 🥶
❤❤
This feels so unreal
Triple H call up CM Punk going WWE
Gosh 😭....I didn't know Stephanie McMahon was there too ...who would her appear in SummerSlam 2024 ...this is crazy 😭 ,, but absolutely great
CM Punk & Cody Rhodes saved WWE
As much as i loved edge's iconic return at the rumble back in 2020 this one right here just hit straight in the feels man as soon as that iconic static sound hits me and my fam were literally jumping & crying out of excitement 🥹this is why i love pro wrestling i live for moments like this man 💯
Noticed seth wasn't shown 😂
Finally they released this, been dying to see it since Punk talked about it in his interview with O'Shea Jackson Jr.
CM Punk’s return to WWE after a decade is the definition of NEVER SAY NEVER. What a legendary moment 🐐
This is what we’ve been waiting for
The sound of "Look in my eyes" is actually the sound of AEW dying!
It's nice to see how much it meant to him. He was all emotional behind the scenes.
3:18
Punk made it sound so dramatic in that interview lmfaoooo love him
Dude my heart was thumping just seeing CM Punk in gorilla, one of the greatest returns in WWE history, period
This is so funny after the cm punk no contest wrestling episode 😂😂😂
The fact that it's already been a year is insane.
Time flies, huh...
im grinning from cheek to cheek like a mad man
Thank god he came back, him wasting away the final part of his career in some insignificant farmer's league would have been such a sad ending
0:03 that guard was all of us 10 minutes later
To me, this is the greatest return of all time
Lol where's Seth? Amazing stuff😊
Greatest comeback ever  ❤
You love to see it
Wow this why we cried because we love this business god save triple h
Hell froze over
Nice cm punk My idol wwe.
Imagine drew come and hug pynk💀
Thanks for putting this up! And happy 1 year return to the Best in the World!
CM Punk was certainly not lying in that interview when he explained how chaotic it was before he went out to the crowd lol 😅
Man was running minds 😅😅😅
Punk shaking Steph's hand, that's long term storytelling right there after what he said about her hand before, tremendous
Thank you Vince for leaving WWE so we can have this moment.
5:53 SO IRISH
such an surreal timeline in which Cm Punk and the Mcmahons get along. Had anyone told us that like the day Punk left AEW i wouldn't have thought this would be possible.
Pls release a full match of seth  vs cody wm38
Just having regal, steph and h in gorilla is the best thing ive seen
Safe to say year one of the return has gone pretty well, even with him being out of action for a large portion of it.
can’t believe it’s already been a year since his return & Randy’s return 🔥
4:49-4:53 best Moment for me❤❤❤
Absolute cinema. 🙌🏻
Finally I've been waiting for this video for so long
BEST IN THE WORLD!
Cant believe it's already been a year....
can’t believe it’s already been a year🔥🔥
This was supposed to start off the Seth vs Punk feud but got injured at the Rumble and was out until like August
Happy first anniversary to the GOAT's return
It's been a year and this is just as crazy to think about. They teased and teased and I could never believe it fr.
5:48 we got Dom getting a warm welcome before GTA 6
❤🤯😘
Man I love CM Punk It was freaking awesome to witness it live, Chick Magnet forever ❤❤
2:17 That smile says everything of how excited he was to be back home after decade.
Who else is sad at the same time that AEW lost one of their best wrestler of all time
One of the best wrestling moments ever when that music hits and he walks out . Goosebumps
I wish they had shown Seth coming backstage and seeing Punk
In person it felt unreal SO LOUD I LOVE IT
I didnt expect CM to be the fifth member ngl🎉😮
What a time to be alive. What a moment. I couldn't believe it. This will live rent free in my mind forever. Punk will always be goated. 🐐
Don't lie this is the greatest return in WWE history 🔥
Ohh Myyy, I'm soo ready to watch this video 🔥
Still feels extremely surreal. One of the very things we thought it was impossible in modern wrestling.
Randy Orton, CM Punk and R-Truth all making their returns at Survivor Series 2023 was epic.
Who love Roman Rings ❤
We all have been waiting for this to drop!
Brock Lesnar vs CM Punk vs Roman Reigns For Paul Heyman
CM Punk is home.  Such a great return.
The best return in wwe history thanks triple h and cm punk 👍🏻
😅copying AEW.  They did it better as well
Best return in 2023
