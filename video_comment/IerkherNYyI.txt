Preston black ice is not what you depicted to be black ice thin clear layer of ice on roads. It does not come in big chunks like you do in your 100 layers. So please stop giving the use of today misleading information because when they grow up and start to drive and someone says there's black ice on the road they won't be looking for huge chunks of ice. An FYI the definition of black ice is. A thin clear layer of ice also known as a glazed of ice on roads. The reason why black ice is so dangerous it's because of how clear it is on the road where drivers don't see it banking lose control

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. Below is the full text typically read during the test:   ---  "The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but it gets faster each minute after you hear this signal: bloop. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound: ding. Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word 'start.' On your mark, get ready, start."   ---  The test starts slow and gradually increases in pace, requiring participants to keep up with the audio cues for as long as possible. Each level lasts about a minute, and participants need to reach the end line before the beep to stay in the test.

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

No scot only chace  The FitnessGram Pacer Test, also known as the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER), is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test designed to measure a student's aerobic capacity and endurance. It involves running back and forth across a 20-meter distance at increasing speeds as instructed by audio cues. The pace starts slowly but increases gradually with each level, making it progressively more challenging. The test continues until the participant can no longer keep up with the pace.  The PACER test is part of the FitnessGram assessment, which evaluates various aspects of physical fitness in school-aged children, including cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, flexibility, and body composition. The primary goal is to promote lifelong habits of physical activity and fitness.

The fitnessgram PACER Test, or Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run, is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that measures a student's endurance, performance, and fitness. The test involves running back and forth across a 20-meter line as many times as possible while keeping up with a pace that increases each minute. The start and end of each lap are signaled by a beep, and voice artists call out the levels. The test continues until the student reaches their maximum lap score.

The fitnessgram PACER Test, or Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run, is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that measures a student's endurance, performance, and fitness. The test involves running back and forth across a 20-meter line as many times as possible while keeping up with a pace that increases each minute. The start and end of each lap are signaled by a beep, and voice artists call out the levels. The test continues until the student reaches their maximum lap score.

The FitnessGram Pacer Test, also known as the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER), is a multistage aerobic capacity test that measures a participant's endurance, fitness, and performance. The test involves running back and forth across a 20-meter track while keeping pace with beeps. The pace increases every minute, and participants must run faster to keep up. The goal is to run as long as possible while completing a single lap each time a beep sounds. Participants receive a point for each 20-meter distance covered, and the number of shuttles completed is their score. If a participant fails to reach a marker in time, they receive a caution, and a second caution ends the test.

FOR CHASE. The fitnessgram PACER Test, or Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run, is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that measures a student's endurance, performance, and fitness. The test involves running back and forth across a 20-meter line as many times as possible while keeping up with a pace that increases each minute. The start and end of each lap are signaled by a beep, and voice artists call out the levels. The test continues until the student reaches their maximum lap score.
Chase is dumber so he's funnier :)

Why don’t you just try 100 Layers of bubblegum
Yeah, but I think I’m a tiebreaker that’s why you should definitely have like Scott and Keely and then you and Chase I’m gonna another team but if you’re gonna be on a team, then you have to do 100 layers of different cartoon characters and it would be impossible Because you would have to use my characters like Robocar poly or like polly pocket plus most of the other layers would totally be cool, including the layers because it would definitely all of the super villains as well, so it would be like really thick ice wall that would almost be impossible to break maybe but you never know with my kind of questions and also I still just like leaving cool comments especially on this video plus you definitely have to search for those Easter eggs for the video game and maybe this will even help you with part two of that indigo park game that you played plus I know life hacks too because you’d have to go through. Where have you been like in chapter 1 already? And go back through like the train ride. Because then there’s more secrets. That has something to do with like. The video game with the amazing digital circus and if you don’t know what I’m talking about then it’s another horror game where you have to like. Hide from  came  but it’s totally hard.

The FitnessGram PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.  The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the FitnessGram assessment. Students run back and forth as many times as they can, each lap signaled by a beep sound. The test get progressively faster as it continues until the student reaches their max lap score.  The PACER Test score is combined in the FitnessGram software with scores for muscular strength, endurance, flexibility and body composition to determine whether a student is in the Healthy Fitness Zone™ or the Needs Improvement Zone™.

hey Preston the best person to do 100 layers with is Scott because he does it better than chase does and Scott does not try to distract you like chase does when you do 100 layers vs 100 layers
Scott better

Chase is the best ❤

The FitnessGram PACER Test, or Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run, is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that measures a student's endurance, performance, and fitness. The test involves running back and forth across a 20-meter line as many times as possible while keeping up with a pace that increases each minute. The start and end of each lap are signaled by a beep, and voice artists call out the levels. The test continues until the student reaches their maximum lap score.
This is one of the most entertaining video from preston from my preference

use a sledge hammer for the ice
Reminder, black ice is very dangerous on roads, since it’s so smooth and compact, it isn’t easily broken, and wheels on cars slide easily. So during car roads during the winter, be mindful of black ice.
Chase is better in the 100 layers challenge videos.

Hi i like ur video preston
Fun Fact I love your videos and I will love To see you in person
The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that increases in difficulty as it continues. The test involves running back and forth across a marked 20-meter track while keeping time with beeps. The running speed starts slowly but increases each minute after a beep, and participants must complete a lap each time they hear a ding. If a participant doesn't reach the next marker in time, they are cautioned, and a second caution ends the test. The number of shuttles completed is the participant's score.
