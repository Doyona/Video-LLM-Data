Quiero subtítulos en español 😢😢😢😢😢
I enjoyed this show. But I thought that it should have been more dating parts to it. I didn't like the whole coffee truck outings. Then guys were leaving the show, then returning. I thought that was odd. I wanted to see more of Taeheon. He was my favorite. Dai and Shun were the only two that I potentially saw as a couple from the show. Hopefully, more couples will come out of the next season.
彼らが彼らに反応するのを見るのはとてもかわいいです
みんな好き❤❤❤
めっちゃ面白いwwwみんなが自分たちの動画を振り返って見て笑ってんの幸せすぎる！！！
6:30  when you know someone is in love 😍. Love the tears 😭
Oh my Dai and Shun are really doing well. I wish y'all the best

げんせいがちかわ笑笑
Who was pausing and playing every 5 seconds because we were blushing so..hard and shy despite watching all the episodes of the show
全員可愛すぎて、私は死にます🥹❤️！
Seeing Dai cry made .e think they broke up. I wonder how they are now
Daishun❤❤❤❤❤❤
Coloca uma legenda em português aí Netflix e da próxima vez faz o favor de capitar a reação dos participantes mais detalhadamente são muitos pra pouco conteúdo
I watched it and It was beautiful emotional reality TV and good it was translated to English.  This is a real love story of friendship, love, acceptance and openness.
DaiShun ❤❤🎉🎉
❤ Can't wait for season 2
6:33 Wooooo Dai, you made me cry too and laugh loud after 😂😢😂
Oh My God 😂😂 what a embarassing moment for all of them... 😢 C'est juste drole à regarder mais honnêtement j'aurai pas aimé être à leur place sauf si je suis Dai et que j'ai rencontré mon Shun  ;)
部分じゃなくてフルでみんなの反応見たい。
素敵な仲間たちに囲まれてずっとずっとしあわせいてね〜✨💓✨💓✨
OMG, Dai is sooooo Charming.
It waslike a series with DaiShun as main lead.
4:00 💘
Kazuto is so hottttt
Когда же выйдет 2 сезон? Обещали снять и молчат 😞
6:24 the touch moment and the tear of happiness  of Dai made me crying so much how they are finally together. TT
no black man? thats very unlike Japan media when it comes to "romance"
🇺🇸 DaiShun!!
Allan is really good in terms of giving opinions,,he can be a good host 😊
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Oh good ive got captions 😂👌🎉💕
Oh man why couldn't someone dubb this 🙃 😂
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
The boys are already precious to us! i kinda miss them!
This reality show is not about your gender in generally speaking. More as I've seen is the connection between, the responsibility, the moments, the ups and downs of each other's, respect. It's a good thing that they developed the emotions with their own personal feelings. It's a challenges but inspiring to know more of them 💞🤗😎💝
しゅんちゃんいつの間に移動したの🥹
Thank you all so much for participating in this series.  It opened up another world for me and I appreciate the love that just poured into my heart for anyone who is gay.  This was life changing for me and I’m sure, for so many others.  Words are so inadequate for what you have done for the rest of the world.  You showed us how to love and live.
3:12 it's funny
残りのエピソードのワッチパーティーも見たいなー。
I loved this show sooo much!! I cant wait for the 2nd season to come out!
I wish this was much longer!! 🙏
イクオいらない。😫
Did anyone know that kazuto did a porn video 😢 and I just rendomly watched it 😅
イクオいらない
ダイとおんなじタイミングで泣いてしまった😭😭😭😭
Well Shun and Dai are still together. They made a Xmas post on Dai's instagram. So still in love!
鶏胸肉事件大好き😂 www
Ugh dai crying 😩❤️
i thought they would post full reactions to the episodes and not just cuts ahhhh haha
The Boyfriend was well made. Such so at the beginning one could fall for them all just for their handsome looks but as the series progressed I felt immersed like I was there and got to know them better. In the end there was only one I would have chosen, Ryota. That's just me though. Well played team.
リョウタくんのコメントがとてもよかったです🎉
6:24 Dai foi o melhor participante. Ele é tão precioso. Torço muito por ele
みんな可愛いくて胸が痛いよー😭 こんなに大好きな番組久しぶりだった🥲🩵みんな大好き🤍
Ohh Dai 😢😔
I congratulate Alan for his final words in this video and I agree with him that it does not matter if they are men or women, nor what age they are or what social class they belong to, they are human beings letting their feelings flow freely, transmitting them so sincerely that I could feel them as mine, as if I were falling in love... and I am a heterosexual woman who could be the mother of any of you. Thank you all  for being so spontaneous and for giving us precious moments, and thanks Netflix for guide this group.
Ikuo got minimal screentime in the show and in this reunion 😢
everyone is so cute
0:39 Gensei is so cute
Shun looks happier
イクオとリョウタが無理。
Awww Dai crying i ca- my heart 😭
Dai llorando❤❤❤❤los amo😊😊😊
including this was there an after party?   did they watch all series  on here while at reunion  ? or only sections  of the series   was this party  after the first meet  with judges tae is like a big brother , hes  sweet -     im gladif he does not have a romance  he has friends  from group
Ryota was literally no brainer! the cutest, ALAN HIS ENERY IS SOOOOOO CAPTIVATING! IN LOVEEE anddd kazuto is looking 😭🤌💋
Alan, você é perfeito. Entenda ❤
Love DaiShun couple. Wish Alan & Ikuo would link together, they seem more like a match. And I root for Usak & Kazuto
I wish Taeheon and Gensei would shave! Their typical Asian facial hair doesn’t look great…it’s not fully connected goatee and mustache. Taeheon has such a hot body. He’s also not bad looking at all if he can shave and get a better hairstyle.
Really wish Usak & Kazuto as a couple. They’re both introverted and low key type. Usak & Taeheon would be good together too.  Ryota & Gensei look more like as a couple. Ryota need to be in sync with reality and not cling onto what doesn’t fit him. That’s the problem with the gay society and why most are single and lonely.
3:41 ❤❤❤❤owww 3:42
The oscar worthy acting that DaiShun did there 😂
みんなが素敵すぎて全員大好き🫶🏻
I saw all the episodes. All the men are so nice and friendly to each other. They are so respectfull. Greetings from Germany!
OH I REALLY WANT TO SEE THEIR REACTION ON LATER EPISODES NOT JUST 3 😂
6:23 aww he’s crying 🥺🥹
アランが最後にコメントしてましたが、私も友達におすすめした時に同じ様な事を言ってました😊 性別関係なく、ドキドキするって！
12分じゃ足りない！ノーカットで皆んなの反応見てたい笑
タイプではないけど、アランは終始めちゃくちゃ良いこと言ってる。本当に出来た人間だと思う。
ゲンセイさん、動画見返して恥ずかしがってるの可愛かったです😊 あとダイさんが動画を見て泣いてのが、こっちまで泣きそうになりました😊
You guys are amazing 😍 Love you from South Africa
Thank God there is subtitles ❤
Japan won my heart with this show 💯❤️❤️🥰🥰. Every single one of the cast was amazing in their own way🫶🏻❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
みんなそれぞれのいい所がありすぎて最高です
アランの最後の言葉素敵✨
なんか男女の恋愛リアリティショーとはまた違ってとても綺麗ですよね！友情と恋愛が上手く共存している
Essa lágrimas de gratidão do Dai éu nunca vou superar foi fantástico meu amor você é merece todo amor e felicidade com o Shun, meus denguinhos 🇧🇷 ❤️
Quero este vídeo com legendas em português 😢
シュンくんがダイくんのことをダイって呼び捨てで呼んでたから2人は今も一緒にいるのかもーって予想してしまった🤭💓
Thank you !!
Kazuto is somehow even hotter than when he’s in the show. How did he do that? 🫠
DaiShun 👬
I want to hug dai so much ❤❤❤
This made me get to know gay men more and realize there are true connections there outside of sex, Thank you for being able to educate myself on this. It was humanizing.
Aqui no Brasil dar tapa nas costas quando abraça é sinal de indiferença com o abraço, por isso o rapaz brasileiro tem um abraço tão gostoso, abracem de verdade as pessoas até que elas sintam seu carinho.
MY DIASHUN HEART ❤
I love all of them
Dai loooooves shun soooooo much, look at those tears🎀😭❤️❤️
Obviously Kazuto gained weight lol
メンバー変えて第二期とかやってほしい！！！🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️💕
シュンのいろんな表情が見れてるのってほんとダイのおかげなんだろうな〜ってしみじみ感じた😢✨✨
ゲンセイの勘違いみんなで笑って見れんのほんと仲良くて安心したＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷ
Love Alan energy
あーまた見たい！シーズン2あるのかなぁ！？ 今年1番印象に残ってる作品！
This was the best reality dating show I’ve ever seen. These guys are so intelligent and genuine.
Season2やってほしい。
Thank you the Boyfriend cast. I enjoyed all of you
まじで全員好きだ、、リアリティーショーでこんなことある？？
なんかもう胸がいっぱい。まじでアンタたちこれからも笑顔で過ごしてよね
テホンさん最初怖い人かと思ってたけどほんとに優しくて周り見ててすごく素敵な人だった
全話のウォッチパーティは無いの😭?
出演したみんなの他人に対する優しさや思いやりがとても伝わってくるそんな心が優しくなれるドラマでした🙂‍↕️🩷みんなの良いところをどんどん見つけたくなるくらい、みんなが好きになりました✨どうか今、みんなが幸せで居ますように。
Is their episode 2
カズトが眩しすぎる〜🥹🥹🥹
Shun became a bright person after Dai❤
Omg poor gensei, kawaiiii. I love himmmmmmm
どんな髪型もどんな髪色もどんな服もどんなメガネも似合っちゃうアランすげえ
I want a Japanese gay boyfriend(i'm not a gay man
PLEASE GIVE US THEIR REACTION FOR EP4 -10 I REALLY WANT THAT ❤🥹
Completely release all of their scenes, seeing their reaction in the Pufavor house.

LOVE HAS NO GENDER

Por favor hagan este video traducido  al español, gracias
人間関係を築くお手本だと思いました。感動して泣いてしまった還暦の私です。素晴らしい👏
❤🧿❤️DaiShun
ダイ、シュン出会ってくれてありがとう♡ ずっと幸せでいてね
Did Dai and Shun ended up together for real?.They are so cute together..❤
カット無しで全部見せてくれえええ たった12分じゃたりん！！！！
本編と同じ順番で登場してる💖
❤miss them boys 🥰 hope they live well and strong ✨
鶏肉事件ほんとにおもろすぎるwwwwwwww
7:59 honestly, I have the same exact thing. Honestly it’s probably a trauma thing, but same, I think I love somebody but I can’t really tell so it takes me a while to like- truly know if I’m into somebody? It’s hard to tell if I’m into somebody or if I just like the thought of somebody treating me with genuine decency
Thanks for the subtitles Love this show
I love that piano scene. I'm pretty sure that's when Dai really fell for Shun, him shedding tears when watching it solidified it for me.
daishun in the boyfriend vs the now in a relationship daishun are two different set of people. their growth is crazy if you keep up with them in real life
最後のシメがアランの言葉なのほんとわかる
X favor como ago para berlo sub español
Popa Teahon
みんなほんと好き。みんなのそれぞれの先を応援してます~📣
Shun was abusive the entire show. He had no regard for Dai's feelings and treated him badly for no reason. If you are angry or upset with someone, you talk to them. You don't play games to make them feel bad. No one has to know what makes you unhappy with, so you have to say it, nicely. What he did was not cool, it was not romantic. Don't romanticize toxic and abusive relationships.
So cool to hear their real voices!
The fact that Kazuto used to be an AV star, simply blew my mind🤯
もうみんな大好きぃぃぃ ゲンセイさんの勘違いも ユーサクさんの鶏肉も大好きすぎる
Assistir novamente dar uma alegria ver todos os meus namorados ❤️ foi um prazer te assistido os 10 episódios e fora do show tá sendo maravilhoso cada um de vocês merecem ser muito feliz encontrar um verdadeiro amor, como "Dai e Shun ser encontrarão lá e é tão apaixonante vê-los juntinhos e felizes assim sera na vida de cada um dos 7 meus amores 🫶🇧🇷🇧🇷 sempre vou assistir este vídeo pois ele me da muita alegria de vê-lo pois torcer muito para ver o Dai e Shun juntinhos e felizes
日本発祥で同性恋愛ショー見れたのは本当に、自国民として嬉しかったし、元々偏見は無かったけど色眼鏡で見ちゃうとこはあったのかなと。 でもこうやって見てると単純に同じように楽しんだり苦しんで恋愛や友情してるんだって思えていい作品でした。制作側も皆を傷つけずメンタル維持させる為にケアに走りながら仕上げてる意識の高さにベストクオリティ！凄い！まじ！ 泣けてくるわァ
アランは毎回そうだなってことを言う…ゲイとか関係なく。。男と女の気持ちを言葉にしてくれてありがとうすぎる。。
I'm so happy Shun got it together cause I think Dai is so perfect and didn't deserve that roller coaster but so happy they're together in the end. I need another season please!
視聴会全部みたい😭笑
かずとくんがもう、朝倉海そっくりなんよ！笑
Wow they watching after is so fun and nice #THeBoyfriend👏👏
ダイシュンほんとに好きすぎる、シュンの表情が柔らかくなってるのも泣いちゃう
なんかもうほんとにみんな大好き。みんな可愛い息子すぎる。この子達の笑顔を守りたい。みんな可愛くて仕方ない。
もうみんな可愛すぎて、カッコよすぎて100話くらい見たいんですけど😢❤
I loveeee it❤❤
🥰 O Brasil ama esses meninos🥰🇧🇷😘
Muitas emoções , meus bebês lindos e apaixonante 🥰 amo demais 🇧🇷❤️
アランのおかげでハグ文化になったの本当に素敵だった
シュンとダイのピアノのシーン、大好きで本編見た時は"素敵〜🥺"って単純な気持ちで好きになったけどこのアフターウォッチパーティーでダイが涙しながら観てた事、そしてダイがシュンも自分に寄り添ってくれていたことに気が付けて感謝と言っていた事が重なって私も涙😭 まじでこんなに心がキュンとなるリアリティーショー初めて。ありがとうボーイズ達！🧡
beautiful love
他人だからこそ寄り添うのってて大事なんだなって思えた
Wait did Taehoun come out to his parents??
同姓愛者の方と接する機会がなかったけど、アランさんが言うようにほんとに男も女も関係ない、みんな同じなんだって共感しかなかったです！！ そして皆さんが人一倍優しいのはきっとそれぞれ抱えてきたものがあってお互いにそこを理解しているからなのだろうなぁと。
ノーカット版欲しい、、、
シュンさん明らかに表情明るくなっててよかった
I want to see more ...full video
Alan is such a sunshine
登場人物一人残らずみんな素晴らしい
i hope there would be another reunion video for the rest of the episodes... waiting
恋愛に臆病だったり、積極的にアピールしたり、恋愛を進めるスピードなど様々で、 男女関係ないんだなぁって思った！ 何よりみんな優しくて思いやりがあっていい子達で感動した！
Sempre que eu entrar pra ver este vídeo as emoções vai vim pois Shun e Dai  foram que deu vontade de assistir por causa da perseverança e o medo "  ver  está lágrimas de  Dai me faz chorar 🇧🇷🫰 graça a Deus que estão juntinhos e felizes te amo muito
The tears rolling down Dai’s face.😢 He is such an emotional and sensitive guy. His heart is so soft. Shun needs to really cherish this man’s love. 💕
The reunion is not on the episodes, where can I get get?
💖💖💖
ダイシュンのピアノのシーンでダイくんが涙ながしてるの見て貰い泣きした😭
10:56この作品を見終わったあと、この気持ちでいっぱいだった
we need full reaction!!!!
げんせいさんかわいすぎwwwwwww
They are so special people and each one of them so precious. I needed to watch The boyfriend. Thanks.
シュンくん角がとれてさらにかっこよくなってる😆
ちいかわゲンセイ愛おしすぎる
Where is the watching of the later episodes?! I must see this as well!!
Just turn on captions…
まだダイとシュンって付き合ってるんですか？！
I love thisss
ゲンセイ赤ちゃんwwwかわいすぎしんどwwww
アランの気遣い素晴らしい
Season 2 is needed ❤
みんなに幸あれ❤❤❤
I just love them sooo much
しゅんが沢山笑ってて嬉しい
안녕하세요 다이는 이쿠오와 잠시 데이트를 하고 헤어졌습니다. 그 후 SHUN이 ❤️을 시작했습니다. 이런 소식을 몇 페이지에 걸쳐 공유했는데, 사실인지 궁금합니다.
最高でした！第2弾待ってます( *´꒳`* )
ボーイフレンドってこれで終わるんじゃなくてもっと色んな人に変わって〜編ってできてほしいんだけど。、。
Ga suka Shun. Botty problematik.
Not Dai crying on the first ep and Shun having like 7 out of 10 cliff hangers 🤣🤣
Raise hands🙋‍♀️ who wants to watch the whole video with their reaction ,please Netflix Japan🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
言いたい事たくさんあるけど、とにかく本当に良い作品だった‼︎ 日本でこれが実現できた事を誇りに思います。 勇気を出して出演してくれたボーイズの皆さんに感謝します。
アランみたいな感性を持てる人間になりたーい
ゲンセイほんとかわいい　だいすき😍
Such a good group of people. Good show.👍
How I wish there is a english subtitle because I can't understand everything they are saying. But I super like this reality show.
i love the whole group dynamic, they are so close now and i hope they make another season !! 💓
だいちゃんが泣いてて私まで泣いちゃったーＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷＷ
Dai crying ❤❤❤❤
Ok but I got sooo sick of hearing the Dazed and Confused song though
Just got some of their skin1004 products., let me see if my skin ( that is fuckin sensitive) work. I am using some Korean products that my  former coworker brought  bk from Korea for me.  And I love it… now those same products are selling thru Costco from a 3rd party.
ダイシュンはマジで出会うべくして出会ったよな
みんなより出遅れてみ初めて今日半日で見終わったんだけどほんまやばい、見てよかった
wait y'all doesnt have subtittles?
Se @Netflix  postasse o vídeo inteiro das reações deles eu iria assistir com gosto 😌🇧🇷
i need the uncut version 😭
USAK AND KAZUTO 🫶🏼
i'm falling loved with this guys, they are so romantic and warming, that's word about love! Hugs from brazil <3
Legenda brasileira 😢🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
和人さんにとって、これは最も辛いことだったと思います。なぜなら、彼を愛してくれる多くの人を断らなければならなかったからです。多くの人を傷つけるのは辛かったに違いありません。
Omg seeing dai crying during the piano scene is so overwhelming. He is so moved out and in love 🥹
シュンとダイ2人揃って眉アートしたのかな🥰
Any full version will be shared?
Netflix ,we all watched this on Netflix, it could have been better if you translated for us that isn't from Japan, their fans are not only from japan .
Netflix ,we all watched this on Netflix, it could have been better if you translated for us that isn't from Japan, their fans are not only from japan .
1人1人個性ゆたかで、終始次の展開が気になる😂待ちきれないって見てたらｲｯｷ見してましたwそれぞれ異なる環境にいたﾒﾝﾊﾞｰが出会い、全員がｱﾝﾃﾅをはりめぐらせ周りを知って探っていく感もﾘｱﾙでよかった。恋愛て誰しもぶつかるのが、思い通りにいかない歯がゆさだったり想像つかない傷つきだったり。簡単じゃないぶん意中の相手と気持ちが繋がったときの幸せて何倍にも感じるし、視聴者もこのﾒﾝﾊﾞｰの誰かに恋してみてた人もいるはずwとりあえずSHUNの自由さは見ててｲﾗもあればw羨ましさもあり、周りに左右されず、自分ﾍﾟｰｽで恋愛してる姿は印象的でした。あと、ほんとｶｽﾞﾄよ〜←入ってきた瞬間すぐわかるｺｲﾂ全部もっていくだろな感wしかもﾓﾃまくりでもﾃﾝｸﾞ👺にならないのが素敵。こりゃﾓﾃるの納得...最後に誰かをすきになることて男女性別関係なくみんな一緒だよね。知りたいも探るも傷つくも喜びも恋愛するて平等。見終わった後、なにかしらｺｺﾛになにかあるはずなんで。いいものをみれました✨️ありがとー
they watch till ep 3 why they didint uoload the full vedio
最後のアランさんの言葉すごく素敵で本当にそうだなって思いました。
Dai crying at the closing song is me every show. I cried at the start, end and middle of every show 😢.  I also leaned their subbed voices are not quite spot on for most of them.
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER EPISODE IM BEGGING😭😭😭😭😭😭
Cc is available
もうね、みんな素敵過ぎて大好き！
I love ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Will you show us the rest of the reactions? 😊
Hi, just want to say, you can turn on the caption on this video so you see what they were saying in the subtitles. I noticed a few comments stating they couldn’t understand. I am watching from Cambodia and greetings to everyone!
このパーティのフルってどこで見れるか分かりますか？😢
rewatching this while i wait for the reunion insta live on 25th.
rewatching this watchparty.. I just miss their interaction outside the Green Room. 🥰🥰
Poderia ser legendado em português
6:20 まてまてまて ここまでみんな可愛いなと思って見てたのに号泣した
2:21 ここの大くん嫉妬気味なの可愛い
なんか泣く
I love this but I feel a bit bad that Ikuo wasn't in any of the episodes they watched together. Must have felt lonely to him.
Thoroughly enjoyed this program
This show was like watching 12 year old girls try and date.
Where can we watch its full version ?? On Netflix ??
All these men have no balls
Loved this show!!! Season 2 maybe?? 🥰🥰
Guys just activate the subtitels and you will understand everything :) happy to see them all together again :)
Donde se podrá ver con subtítulos en español? 😭😭😭
❤
Dai is toxic and Gensei is immature
リョウタがんばれ！！！！って気持ちで見てました❤✨みんな素敵😊なんだか人生楽しもう🎉って気持ちになりました！
ダイの涙に釣られる🥲
Love this group together, great casting!! ❤
Is there a part 2 and part 3?
Dai crying made me cry.
アランの回しがさすがすぎるんよwww
同性の恋愛って凄く心惹かれるものがあるし、切なくなったり、感動したりする。何でだろう？って考えた時に、完全に私見だけど、「純粋な愛」があるからこそだと思う。 （不快にさせたらごめんなさい）異性間の恋愛って生物学的にも自然な事だから、当たり前って思ってしまうんだけど、同性の恋愛って偏見とかではなく不自然だから、純粋さと真実の愛があってこそ成り立ってるように感じる。だからこそ、心惹かれるし、切なくなるし、感動してしまうんだと思う。
daishun❤
3:10
What alan said in the end YES they were so open and honest about their feelings that everyone can learn something from or relate to one of their situations. Thank you guys and wish you all the best! ❤
みんな可愛いだいすき幸あれ
Are there no part 2 on this?
Ikuo’s entrance was so awkward 😀
That piano moment, Dai has it in his cellphone, he film it that night. I wonder how many times he watched it while he was in the Green Room.  Why no one hug Ikuo?, OMG, it was ackward...
Dai teared while rewatching Shun played the piano for him. It made me cry too. I guess Dai loves Shun.❤
This group of wonderful man have made the show  They are special each in there own way
So cute, all of them ❤
It's like so good to watch them all together with true beams an good bonds, they seems so happy an I wish that would last long with togetherness, I'm so happy that Shun realizing about Dai love an sincere all the time and wish this bring all of them much closer like before ❤
人選神すぎるのよʅ（◞‿◟）ʃ
カズト更にイケメンになってるし、体もごつくなってて良すぎるわあ
ネトフリで全部みてきました！！もうほんっとうに良かったです😭みんな大好きみんな尊い😭友達でも恋人でもいいから最初から打ち明けていいんだって仲間に出会える場を作ってくれたこの企画最高です😭無理やり恋人をつくる終わりじゃないのも最高でした！永遠に続いてほしい😭
ピアノシーンなける
みんな幸せでいて😭
Dai nangis😢😅
Necesito los subtítulos en español me encantó el reality
I would have liked to be on the program
皆すてき！
În sfârșit, avem traducerea! Mi-a plăcut foarte mult emisiunea și dinamica dintre participanți 🥰 Rămâne în inimile noastre evoluția relației dintre @daishun ❤️  Mă bucur că se iubesc și sper să fie fericiți mulți ani împreună! 🌈 Vă pup din Romania 🇷🇴
The best reality show I have ever watched. It is so heart warming to see their friendships grew. DaiShu  is my favorite. ❤
泣かすなああああああ
Aww the cast is so cute ... damn. We need a lot of followup content yalll
希望有中文字幕🥺🥺🥺
Plz plz PLZ film them watching the next 3 episodes too… I’m so invested in all of them and how they are doing!! ✨💛✨
I wish i could like this video a million time
I really love Usak so so much, that man is amazing! I'm sure him and Kazuto would've gotten close if he didn't leave so early... I was so saddd
One of the best shows ever. I hope we get a second season
GIVE US THE FULL VERSION
Los amo, quiero otras 10 temporadas
イクオ推し！人間性がだいすき！
J'ai adoré les revoir ❤❤❤❤❤
at this point, it’s a DaiShun series and everyone else are just extras 😂😂😂
なんかさ、オシャレなんよ。 かっこいいし、かわいいし、キュンキュンするし、バケーション感、非日常感、映画みたいで。 出演者のカリスマ性もだけど、この人たちを選んだスタッフのセンス、とにかく音楽から何から何までセンスが爆発してて良い！！ この夏に見れて本当に良かった。
ピュアなみんなが大好きです。いつもそのままありのままで幸せになって欲しいです。
♡♡♡
Can we get another watch party please for each episode? ❤
Sincerely I enjoyed too much the boyfriend drama, because of the had differents situations that were well worked, besides here was taught sensible problems in the community LGTBI wiith mature thinkings, my favorite couple since the begining was Dai-Shue. Congratulations all of you
全話みんなで見てほしい！！！！笑笑お願い！！😂😂
Segunda temporada por favor.....😢
Happy to see them together again.....
Shun become more cheerful....love effects 😁😘
6:14  本編でもここのシーン、うっとりしてしまう程、儚くて美しくて愛おしい時間で素敵だなって思ってたけど、このシーンを見て泣いてるダイくんの姿見て、本当にシュンくんのこと大好きなんだなって、ふたりにとって大切な時間だったんだろうなってこちらまで泣けてきた😭😭
人間としてみんな良すぎて。最高すぎる。彼らと知り合えてたらどんなに良かったんだろうなと心から思いました。
What the hell why only English subtitles????? You have fans all over the world 😢😢😢😢😢 Que droga  por que só  legendas em inglês?????   Vocês  tem fãs  no mundo todo 😢😢😢😢😢
my second hand embrassment to gensei 😭
6:21  ここダイにピント合ってるけどシュンの笑顔が可愛すぎるーーーーーー！！！ 幸せになれー！！！
Btw guys,  Anyone knows who wrote to Gensei on the first day.  There were only six people (D,T,R,G,S,K) on the first day and there were six letters (Dai 3, Gensei 1, Shun 1, Kazuto 1). Shun said he didn't write to anyone, right?  Then how was there 6 letters, it should be only 5 letters, right?  Otherwise someone had to write two letters to two persons 😂
Oh my God, Dai cried when they were showing the keyboard scene 6.22. He is so expressive and Shun is so lucky to have him.
マジでw'm'm.'wmtat みんな可愛くてw.m'mtmmwm.a 感情がmwdtmt😁😊🤣😊😚🙂
6:30 OMG DAI IS CRYING I CANT TAKE THIS
DaiShun😍😍😍
Dai and shun🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️👉🏻💗👈🏻
I loved this series so much! Kazuto was my favourite. What a sweetheart! Alan brought the boy. Dai and Shun brought the drama, but I love them as well. Such a great watch. Hope there’s another season.
I love how genuine Alan is. The way he smiles and hugs them is pure joy. He seems like the sweetest thing 🥹
ゲンセイの勘違いは、厨二の時に書いた日記を、大人になってから親が部屋を整理して出て来たからと大事に取っといていて、彼女を家に招いた時に子供の頃の写真と一緒に提出された時に匹敵する。
This has to be the best gay dating reality show that’s been made. So enjoyable to watch. Please make another season. 🙏
Onde vejo dublado  português
イクオ福士蒼汰みたいになってんじゃん👏
I love u “ The boyfriend “ 🥰🙏🏻🇭🇳🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸 I love u “Dai” & “Shun” 🥰🏳️‍🌈
I would love to meet Usak. I think he is handsome and attractive. ❤
dai cried of happiness cause of the piano scene so cute
Shun is my spirit animal
アランとカズトの吉報まってる。
Cadê as legendas em português???
Ga ada yg sub indo kek😭
Dai's crying was so sweet. I wasn't really sure about him. He seemed like a party boy durning the show. But he really isn't . He's very sweet and kind.
i was getting secondhand embarrassment for them HAHAHAHAHA  omg daishun 😭
テホンさんだいすきよーーー😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Despite the polish and bright of this show...Being gay is hard. Especially when you're not "traditionally" attractive like how gay men are presented in popular media. However, I'm so happy i got to see this show! Love Japanese culture and Men, too! It has made me feel things I haven't felt in a while...I've realized how sentimental I am! : want the ups and downs, cherished moments and even the misunderstandings!. I hope that one day I will be able to share that with someone special.  Watching Dai cry while watching back the moment at the piano with Shun was soooo touching!!
気づいたらシュンがダイの隣に来てるの可愛すぎる🤍
You were all super cute and wholesome. I hope you all find love. After watching this show, all other dating shows look like porn.
06:08 you're welcome
KAZUTO BECAME EVEN MORE HANDSOME OH MY GOSH
Why is no one noticing the ring on Shun’s finger🤩🤩🤩 Is that couple’s ringh❤️❤️🫢🫢
ほんとにアランいいこと言う。 アランの言葉が大好き
７月後半にNetflix３日で2周みて 1周目見た時に、見終わるのもみんなに会えなくなるのも本当に寂しくてまたすぐ2周目見たけど こうやってYoutubeで全員集合して、また姿見れるのがほんとうに嬉しい シェアハウスで個々が色んな感情持つ中で、自分の意見も相手の気持ちや意見も、大事に尊重して接したり、言葉を選んで発言したり、そういう繊細な思いやりの気持ちが目に見えてわかるしすごく伝わってきた 全員が全員いいところがあって人としてすきになれて、人との関わり方やコミュニケーションの図り方など、自分が今後誰かと関わる上で、勉強になって学べるシーンがおおかった。ほんとうに人として尊敬できる人しかいなかった。 メンバーがかけがえのない時間だったと話すように、見ている視聴者も学びや気づきを得る場面はたくさんあったと思う この番組本当に大好きです　こんな愛に包まれた番組他にないと思う　応援し続けたいし、これから他の場面での活躍も応援してます 素敵な番組にであえてよかった！
ボーイフレンドロスすぎて辛い😭 4話〜のウォッチパーティーは無いのかなぁ😭😭 未公開シーンももっと公開してほしいです、、、お願いしますNetflix様😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
全員集結してくださって本当にありがとうございます😭🙏
こっちがオーマイゴット！！！！だよ(ありがとう)
I still wonder what would've happened between Kazuto and Usak if he would've stayed 🥺
やっぱりアランの人間性が好き
ノーカットバージョンも見たい‼︎😭
Onegaishimasu Engilsh!!! Arrigato!!
Alan final speech love it and I love all of them,stay friends forever please.
❤❤❤
Netflix pls release the full reaction 🥹🥹
I loved how they connected so much and how happy they are to reunite, will always be one of my top fav reality series <3
ゲンセイすべてがかわいすぎてもーだめ
Aawww I loved the show❤
Please like this comment so every time I can come back and remember this series ❤
とにかくみんなに幸せでいて欲しい
Por qué no hay subtitulos en español?
Thank you so much Netflix Japan for this video and for the English subtitles! I had so much fun watching this❤ miss them all already
Captions made us all watch it together ❤
1人1人が愛おしすぎる🥹　とても素敵な番組で観ていてとても幸せになりました。ありがとうございます☺️
Eu amei essa série!❤❤❤👏👏👏
I was really disappointed because Dai and Shun seemed like strangers there. It made me so upset! Only during the next meeting did it make my days better :D thank you for this awesome masterpiece!
みんなの感情も言葉も美しくて終始綺麗なものを見せてくれてありがとうの気持ち😮‍💨みんなそれぞれ幸せでいてくれたら嬉しい🥹
اين اجدة مترجم؟
恋愛リアリティーショーでこんなに心を動かされたり、泣いたの初めて𐔌՞⁔т · т⁔՞𐦯💧皆にずっとずっと幸せでいて欲しいって思うし、まだまだ皆の絡みを見てたい🥹終わってから楽しみが無くなっちゃった感じで寂しい〜！！😿皆の元気そうな顔が見れてとっても嬉しかったです😻ありがとうございます💖
now i want watch all the episodes again 🥰though  my 10th ep is pending now, i know i going to cry
I am so touched about what you two said at the end. I am so moved to hear you have so many expectation about the future. Thank you Shun and Dai for sharing your precocious moment with us which really comfort my heart after a long day work....
I av already watched boyfriend 6 times I love it so much
アラン様の黒髪も最高🖤
No matter what anyone says about Shun..The members love and adore him a lot..Usak came first to Shun to hug him..
how to delete something from my brain so i can watch it again for the first time
Season 2 Please
There will never be a group of  guys like Season One❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ryota my heart was with you to find love
Alan you are a nice person but just take a step back. You were alittle overwhelming ❤
I'm 72yrs old lady who LOVED the show. Dai n Shun n Kautzo n Taehon were my favorites.
Idk why Im here I havent finished watching it 😭
has Kazuto been working out? he looks more toned here
Legendas em português por favor
ほんとにほんとにすてき🌏💙🤝✨
真面目に人と向き合って、自分の気持ちにも正直に向き合おうと思える作品でした😭この作品に出演してくださって本当にありがとう！！！😢 ただの恋愛リアリティショーではなくて、人との繋がり方を知れる作品でした✨
みんなの愛のあるあったかいコメントにもウルウルくる🥹
Zest fest 24 japanese version
I really liked this show. Each of the guys brought something special and i hope in time they each find their own someone special just like Dia and Shun❤💚💚
とっても美しい物語を見た気分だったな〜！素敵な作品！
アランめちゃくちゃいい奴すぎて…付き合ったら絶対自己肯定感爆上がりしそう
Please upload full video
Totally loved the show❤ and my fav DaiShum❤love you sooo much❤please be happy together ❤️
2:13 I just noticed now how awkward they were with Ikuo
I’m so happy for shun. Dai’s love can give peace and happiness for Shun. Please always love and happy together for a thousand year.❤🎉
This is hilarious!😂 Aww, Dai crying during the piano scene🥹
❤😂
みんな愛おしい！！！
Usuk is more than a lovely man he is great with a big hart ♥️
ダイは、あの年齢の若さで、目尻の笑い皺入ってることが、本当に彼の人間としての深さを物語ってると思う
テホンとリョータのスピンオフがみたい
これ振り返られるの結構恥ずかしいよな😂
だいしゅん🥺🥺🥺❤️
ゲンセイの勘違いがみんなにバレるの見れてめっちゃ嬉しい😂😂😂😂みんなの反応見たかったから😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Une émission tellement touchante.
この番組，ネガティヴなところがとても少なくてよかったと思う！ わたしにはそれでも十分リアルに見えたし、せっかく出てくれた出演者たちが批判に晒される可能性の上がる編集じゃなくてよかったなぁと
Really want to see them watch all the episodes together
I WANT A REALITY SHOW WITH THEM AGAIN : (
Where can I see full episode
本当に出会えてよかった
6:20 ダイくんがここで泣いてるの、本当に感情豊かで心が綺麗な子なんだなって思った… こっちまで心臓がジーンってなるよ😭
I love Alan reaction whenever he saw everyone there ❤❤
I mean I agree with Allan, Shun is getting cuter.
Meu inglês é uma porcaria, mas consegui entender quase tudo o que eles falaram com o pouco que eu sei. Jamais que eu iria perder um vídeo tão icônico deles, vou guardar eles em um potinho 😢💗
best reality show ever on Netflix! Keep going
I loved this show soooooo much they're all such wonderful people 😭
As a Japanese Hawaiian I absolutely loved it and I really hope there is something like this or even a season two!
Hepsini ayrı ayrı çok sevdm,son derece kibar naif ve saygılı ınsanlar hepsi.Umarım aradıkları aşkı bulurlar ve bu zor dünyada hiç zarar görmeden sevgiyle yaşarlar💗
突然見てみたくなってほぼ1日で完走した。もどかしくてなんで！となることも多かったけど、ダイの一途さをこの動画でまた見れて良かった。アランの素敵な言葉が大好きでそんな人になりたいな（ ;  ; ）♡
Every gay man deserves their Dai. This is so beautiful to see.
Shun looking happy
鶏肉事件まじで草
1日で全話みて見終わった頃にはこのメンバーが尊かった😣😣🫶みんなに幸あれ！！！！
Yo vine por el chisme 😅
かずとがプクプクしてるの良すぎ
Are we not getting next episodes of their reaction ?
ゲンセイかわいい😂❤
Are we not gonna get any more reaction videos?? 😔
ダイで泣いた
L'émotion de Dai est tellement belle! Quel joli couple!
They’re not close with IKUO 😅😅😢
i need part 2 of this🥹
i need part 2 of this🥹
is there gonna be a part 2 of this reaction?
ゲンセイさん本当に好きすぎる最高
シュンくんの笑ってる笑顔がたくさん見れて、こっちまで幸せな気持ちになれたなぁ❤️このメンバー一人一人が最高すぎる！
リョウタはこの髪型で美貌を発揮できるからすごい
I want the whole reaction video 😭💗
4〜10話のウォッチパーティー本当にお願いします！！ この9人だからこその仲の良さ、絆があって最高❤絶対忘れられない思い出になるだろうな。これからも9人全員幸せでいてほしい✨ あと、もしboyfriendにシーズン2とかあれば、今回とは違ったドラマが生まれて面白いと思う。
When they get to the episodes when like EVERYONE likes Kazuto I’m going to die
鶏肉事件ww
げんせいに手紙書いた人は誰だったんだろう？
大人になってから素敵な仲間に出会えるのっていいなぁ。子供の頃からの繋がっている友達がいないから今さら友達の作り方がわからなくて残念。 　出演者の皆さんは人間的にも素敵な方ばかりで、こういう仲間が欲しかった。
I'm from the U.S and loved watching this show very much. Gensei was so gorgeous, intellectual, sweet and empathic and very much my type.  This show really helped me in my current situation about projecting what I want.  Now I understand that if you have to work too hard without mutual progress, then its probably not going to work.  I can't wait for season 2 !
Segunda temporada já 🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Please upload the whole reaction videos🙏, we want to see it🙏🙏🙏
I just noticed , Dai is always the first one to arrive , LOL
Loved this and the show itself, so cute! Would have liked a little life/status update though, like are Dai & Shun still dating, did Kazuto & Alan continue their budding relationship, do any of the others currently have boyfriends, etc
My DaiShun heart <3
The most watched part is their reaction at the kiss😂
ゆうさくだけ一生鶏胸肉の話題なの面白すぎる
Absolutely loved this show.. They are all such kind and heartwarming guys... So sincere towards each other... If we all could live this way.. The world would without a doubt be a better place... Thank you netflix and Japan ❤️🙏
It’s exactly as Alan said: “We all human are the same”. I think I can embrace me now even more thanks to Shun. I believe if only I could understand be better, I’d still be happily together with my ex. I just felt all the time unsure about him and I broke up, because I didn’t want him to feel that.  I love dating shows. Much more helpful than the stories from friends…)
アランほんと魅力的な人だと思う
ウォッチパーティー、全部見させてくれやーーーー！！🥹🥹
ダイの涙よ……泣くよ……
Whatever they're saying, I'm just here to look at Dai and Shun 🤭 I wish they added English subtitles
다이님 눈물의 의미가 뭘까요...?  영어자막 고맙습니다👍
Shun and Dai❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
これって編集必要なくない?全然ライブみたいな感じで全部見るよ!
Believe it or not, this series gave me the encouragement to always express my feelings and know my emotions were valid.
They are my everything ❤😢
シュンがピアノ弾いてるシーンで、 ダイが泣いてる姿見て泣いた(;_;
ダイくんの涙が美しい🥹しゅんくんやわらかな表情なってて素敵🥹みんなみんなそれぞれさらにステキになってて泣いてしまった
This was fun, I noticed though Gensei looked uncomfortable! I hope they were able to comfort him.   Having your life broadcast everywhere can feel very vulnerable, it’s not easy. Sending lots of love from Canada ❤️.
💖💖💖
This series is absolutely refreshing compared to other dating shows! I would love to see them speaking in English and be blown away by how many more audiences they’ll be able to reach. The other Asian and western countries need to pay attention! This show is groundbreaking on every level!!!!
Legendem pra português por favor
本編見終わってこの動画を見て、 コメント欄に来てみたら海外の方々からたくさんの愛と注目を貰っていて出演者や関係者でもないのに誇らしい気持ちになった笑笑 ボーイズ達は勇気を出して出演してくれて、製作者はお洒落な雰囲気やボーイズ達の粋なところを惹き出してくれて、この番組が好きな皆んなにこの夏最大限の感謝と賞賛を贈りたいです！ ありがとう〜！！！笑笑
リアリテイショーだから美形用意してるだけかもだけど、ノンケより美意識高いからゲイ達の方が女性にモテそう😂
こんなにも爽やかで楽しい番組初めて！ シーズン２あるなら早くみたいです！
Eu queria tanto que fosse traduzido em português
Awwww dai crying
ほんと素敵なの
お部屋に入ってきた順番が番組に登場したときの通りなのもエモい🥹🩷
Y’all don’t have button with CC for subtitles or smth?    DaiShun <3
リョウタまじかわいいずっと推し🥹🥹🥹🥹
みんなぎゅうぎゅうになって座ってるの可愛すぎる！ガチャガチャにして！
Pourquoi cet épisode et celui du bilan avec les animateurs ne sont pas disponibles sur Netflix France ?
i like them so much
Where is the 90 minute version of this?!!?????????
6:30 eu ri demais kkkkkkkkk ah não DAI
I need them to watch all episodes  together!
Ciao 🩵💚💛🧡❤️🩷💜💙
Everyone; Talking about feelings, experiences and other guys etc Usak; so the chicken breast....
Aw my poor Gensei! 😆💜 And Dai crying 😭 Love them all and hope they all find love eventually (if that's what they want 🥰)
Alan is so clever. I like him very much.
What's daishun's channel name?
カズト太ってこれ？！？！いけすぎてる‥😭むしろ太ってこの世に増えてくれてありがとう？
久々にネトフリで大ヒットだった❤️ みんな可愛い！！
全話ウォッチパーティー希望！！
I'am  the only one who is still waiting for their reaction for remaining episodes??😭😭
やべー、みんな好きなんやが！ 記憶消してもっかい見たい
Queria legenda em português 😢
4-10話のウォッチパーティもして下さい😭😭😭😭お願いします！！！！！
Sorry but Shun's behaviour on the show was so toxic. I doubt that they stay together for long or have a healthy relationship.
Kazuto 😍😍😍
are you going to be posting the watch party for remaining episodes or is this the only video we get (T_T) ???
Thank you so much, guys! どうもありがとう！❤
この番組が世界中に祝福されていて、とても嬉しい
I usually don't like reality shows, but this one was great! Everyone was so lovely, kind and polite, I was happy to see their friendship and relationships grow
アラン伝わってるよ〜〜〜！！！！泣
7:08
someone please explain to me  Dai's tear...I hope that was a emotion tear or a happy tear....cause that tear made me so sad...
最高の9人 みんな魅力的で素敵だし、人生でかけがえのないも経験、仲間、パートナーを見つけられたと思う。是非シーズン2やって欲しい！
Absolutely loved the show! Thanks a lot for all those emotions, feelings and experience that I got!
ダンスの時あんなにセクシーでカッコいいユーサクがちょっと内気で大人しいギャップ可愛すぎだし 勘違いしてたこと恥ずかしがるゲンセイ可愛すぎる
Gostei muito como foi feito, e como eles todos se colocaram diante de suas realidades👏👏👏👏👏👏❤🇧🇷
テホンさんに夢中ここにきて
Alan!  YES a beautiful point of connection for us all.  ❤️‍🩹🌏💖👏🏽👏🏼👏🏾👏🏻.  🫂&💋x7
YES WE, the world, ARE WATCHING and WE LOVE IT!!!  USAK don’t worry about stepping on toes about the chicken.  They knew you needed it.  You were so fortunate to have such a great group of men mature enough to see a situation and discuss it.  No mistakes just growth experiences. You did great and they hated to see you leave.  So did we.  🥰x8
ほんとサイコーですね このメンツだからこんなに素晴らしい企画になった🎉
言葉選びが素敵すぎるのよ見習いたい
げんちゃんかわいいいぃ
WHO WROTE THE LETTER TO GENSEI?!
amei demais, pois a espera do beijo da noite do sexo do amor vem depois que nos traz a tona os sentimentos_ me vi neste reality por estes motivos e me fez gritar quando shun finalmente beija Dai em fim estou apaixonado pro vc e o outro iden
when Dai cried 🥺🥺🥺
Thank you for bringing this kind of show to us. The genuine emotions of the casts are channeled to the viewers and seeing those emotions what made this special. I truly hope you will have another season, if not excelling the previous season, but at least to not loose this genuity. Props to the cameraman and all those behind the scenes. You're like an artist that painted this wonderful show much better. Very cinematic and I am in awe even if it was just few episodes. Please keep it up, hope to see more of The Boyfriend❤ Can't wait to see more of this
dai such a babygirl
dai aglamaaaaaaa ya kiyamam ayrildilsr mi acaba
We need more reaction videos on later episodes!!
Мы ждем продолжения их реакциии !!!😍😍🤭
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I'm just gonna say it or i'll repeat it if it's already been said but Dai and Shun got on my damn last nerves ya'll. Anyone else or just me?! 😂
あら、やばい！みんなで見るのやばいわ！俺なぜか俺を代入して見てたら、ｐもうやば！！！！！！！！！！！お
勘違いゲンセイ1番可愛い〜〜！！😂笑
最後のみんなのインタビューの言葉一つ一つが美しくてまっすぐで感動しました。なんかひとつ日本から扉を開いた感じがある。素敵な感情をありがとう♥️みんなまとめて大好きです〃♡.♡〃 大好きなmc陣の言葉も入ってるし好き😂❤
Dai and Shun took me on such a rollercoaster
I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE SERIES!!! ❤❤❤ I am very interested to see what happens after the show is over and who has stayed together???
圧倒的にテホン推し
No supero la escena de Dai y Shun en su momento del piano
Do a where are they now video! I want to know what happened to all of them after the show. :-)
Meu Deus lindos
アランのいい加減にして〜おもろいw
良すぎて…また泣くやん…
dai was actually crying when shun was playing piano for him 🥹😊Dai and shun was soo shocked after watching their first kissing scene 😂😂😂 my favourite couple ❤❤❤😊😊😊
Schade keine deutsch Untertitel gibt
鶏肉ほんましぬてwwwwww
🥹❤️
I'm so confused, Shun said this watch party was in October and on video it says 7 month reunion. So in October had it been 7 months since they wrapped up.
I feel bad for Ikuo, you can see he didn’t got closed with anyone
English subtitle please
Hoping for English subtitles pls
で、ゲンセイのポストに手紙入れたのは誰なんだい！😂
I'm here watching this as i really can't fight the strong feeling of MISSING ALL OF YOU!!!!❤❤❤ from 🇵🇭 heree!!!!
Usakk damn. So handsome ❤❤❤ i wil die for him
なんか入ってくる順番に既視感あると思ったらグリーンルームに最初に入ってきた順だからか！
I loved watching this so much 😭😭😭❤❤❤
Those tears of Dai really shoutouts from the screen. I can really feel those tears huhuhuhu. Big hugs for you Dai
I need the complete reaction please !!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍😍😍😍  And I need the reaction for the rest of the episodes please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
みんな愛おしいラブだよー
I still cant get over this reality show. <3
All r looking better than before ❤❤❤
where is full video?
They should've shown the episodes 1, 5 and 6. That way, everyone is shown on screen. I feel so bad for Ikuo.
I hate that Ikuo just feels so left out
pôr favor coloca a legenda em português Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
I really loved this show! All that guys were so cute
Where’s the full reaction 😢😢
Usak is so handsome!
Season 2.  I need as soon as possible!!!!
Los amo mucho 🥰 gracias por un show tan bonito!
where is part 2????
Oh this was so 🅝🅘🅒🅔!! It's the fact that a solid genuine relationship and many friendships came out of it.  These Green Room boys are amazing and sexy and their maturity is next level.  It was a breath a fresh air to watch a really grown up show ❤
ギャルテホン圧倒的に足りない！！！！ギャルテホン未公開シリーズたくさん出して欲しい！
till this day idk who wrote to Gensei😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I wished they put a reaction when Daishun first kissed!!!
So cute✌️😍
great show
Is Shun Japanese, or Korean?
みんなかわいいWWWWWWWWWW
Thanks for Eng Sub
USAKKKK 😭😭😭😭
A reason that make me wanna learn Japanese is this reality.
Netflixのドドン！って音だけで盛り上がってるの男の子って感じでえぇな😂
The English subs captured like 90% of it so I was really happy to see this reunion. Although I wish we got to see them watching all the episodes, especially all the way to the end.
Keep growing guys love you all❤❤❤
ゲンセイって喋り方も仕草もちょーかわいいから癒されてたよー！
When will the global version be released? / グローバル版はいつリリースされますか？
Taeheon is such a sweetheart too, he deserves the world!
Binged it all in one night and I miss em already. Definitely the best reality dating show out there, very tender and honest, I loved and deeply appreciated the platonic love too. The hosts were also funny and great! for once i actually enjoyed commentary when usually i cant stand it. Such a beautiful show
I loved to see that cultural difference. The polite, and respectful way they treated eachother and interacted is refreshingly different than I have experienced in my dating years in Hungary.
ゲンセイさんの勘違い絶対ふれてほしかったから嬉しい〜可愛すぎる〜😭💓
Yes
Are we going to have the longer version of their reunion anytime?
Now that they announced that they officially together, i want #daishun (and the entire cast) to react to rest of the eps. They probably told them not to be very obvious that they are still together here since they are yet to announce their status🥰
But are the two couples still together??
ゆーさくさん鶏肉気にしてて😂 もう、みんな可愛い😭💓💓💓💓
Are they releasing a full reaction video or not??
I wanted to see their reactions for other episodes too =.= T.T
HEY USAK AND KAZUTO WEARING A SAME BRACELET !!!
Yes Alan, well said. Your comment at the end said it all and that is why we Watched and Loved the show. ❤
Are they going to watch the other episodes ?
We need mooorrrreeeeee!!!
やばいみんなのこと大好きだ〜
なんか集まっただけで泣きそう 嬉しい〜
Love them ❤
お願いだから全話ウォッチパーティーフルで見せて😭😭🩷🩷本当に見たいお願いガチで
I want to watch the full version😢
Waiting for season 2
this was literally the best dating reality show i’ve ever watched. I LOVED IT. It was also shot so beautifully sometimes like woah. PLEASE PLEAS PLEASE DO MORE SEASONS. It’s new shows like this that actually spark conversation and make people feel things!!!! I think there could also be a “The girlfriend” too!!!! so much opportunity here. i hope all these sweet boys are living happily rn 😭
Why did Dai cry? Hmmmm  Please teach me japanese huhu
we want the whole reaction pls pls pls
Everyone's reactions to the KISS and the things they didn't know about while doing the show SENT me. Also Dai crying at the piano scene 😭 I love them all so much
Can I see more of this 🤧
Idk what they put on this show but what a breath of fresh air!!!! I’m crying and reading subtitles like I have done the entire series they are really a special group individuals!
ダイの涙がもう、、🥹❤
みんな大好き
더보이프렌드가 일본에서 제작되었기에 전해지는 그 풋풋하고 아련한 감성이 너무 좋아요

유사쿠가 떠나기전까지는 정말 재미있게 집중해서 보고있었는데.. 😢 유사쿠가 떠나고 나서 6화부터인가는 더 보이프렌드 안봤어요
When will the reunion be on Netflix USA?
This show was so great...could they give us another series of it. To show how their lifes are❤
Dai will *ALWAYS* be my most favorite.
テオンさんが誰にも選ばれなかったのが残念だった。心からはユーサクさんと結ばれることを願ったんだけど

i would like the reunion video to be longer
Dai❤Shun
ダイちゃんの涙にもらっちまった🥲 こんなにハマった恋愛バラエティー初めてだわ！
Coloca em português

Happy here
I hope Dai and Shun are still together.
GENSEIが愛らしすぎる！
ウォッチパーティー、使えない話してるとこはカットしてもらって良いからそれ以外全部見せて欲しい ていうか私も同じタイミングで見たい視聴パーティーしたい
ダイとアランが最後までしたって聞いた時の皆の反応が気になる
Oh noooo DAI 🥹❤

o alan exala energia brasileira né? o mais carismatico de todos
Maravilhoso socesos ❤❤❤❤
みんなが揃ってるところがまた見れて幸せ😊ボーイフレンド大好き🫶
No one really got up to hug Ikuo... And he even made it more awkward
入ってきた時のしゅんが別人かと思うくらい柔らかい雰囲気で驚いた！ 愛されるって偉大な力なんだね〜
MORE PLS
i'm confident i've watched this for like a thousand times already. can we ask for the whole video of this please? 🥺🥺
『タラちゃんです』やめて笑笑
いい加減にして！最高すぎるんだけど！！！
DaiShun ❤
ゲンセイ最高やん笑　おもろ
I don't know how to speak English so well, Netflix Japan, could you put subtitles in Portuguese?😢
誹謗中傷とかもあると思うけどめちゃくちゃおもろかったし夢中で見たし火曜日楽しみだったし何にも負けず誇ってほしいです、ほんと楽しかったコンテンツ
This is legitimate the best reality show I have came across in awhile. Everyone was really genuine and inspiring , like I am pretty sure all of us viewers could really relate to their stories and everything. 💟
Alan este perfect in rol de prezentator........Shun este perfect in rol de actor...... de fapt este frumos ca un actor 😊......sa se gândească televiziunea la acest lucru! Voi ce părere aveți? Sunt frumoși si minunați toți băieții......ce m a bucurat până la lacrimi, a fost momentul, cand au anunțat că sunt un Cuplu 🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳 Am revăzut scena sărutului lor, de zeci de ori 😊si de fiecare dată m a emoționat.....am văzut două suflete frumoase,care s au regăsit 😊se simțea si se vedea, ca există ceva minunat intre ei .....si anume Iubire 😊
Aw that was great! I wanna watch a full reaction!
Mi ar placea, sa ni se dezvăluie, ca Alan si Kazuto sunt împreună 😊 Sunt un cuplu foarte frumos! Ii iubesc pe toți băieții care sunt aici......si sunt bucuroasă, de fapt am 😭 de bucurie, cand am văzut ca Dai si Shun, formează un cuplu. Se vede iubirea in ochii lor😊 sunt luminoși și fericiți împreună ❤❤❤❤❤
✨🤸⭐⭐⭐
Finaly subtitles
По факту только одна пара образовалась на проекте! Жаль, столько усилий и... ничего у всех( кроме Дая и Шуна) не получилось.
ボーイフレンドロスだよ😭😭😭 だいすきだった〜〜泣みんなずっと幸せでありますように！！
Ako lang ba ang kinikilig kahit hindi ko naintindihan hahahahahaha
Hello, I hope there will be a 2nd season of "Boy Friend". I loved this reality TV! Like other Japanese reality TV, "Love Village" for example. Thank you.  こんにちは、「ボーイフレンド」の2期があることを願っています。このリアリティショーが大好きでした！他の日本のリアリティ番組と同様に、たとえば「Love Village」。ありがとう。
j'ai vu cette émission sur Netflix et j'ai adore hâte de voir la saison 2, pour ma part je les ai tous aime 😉
how come they didn't add episode 1?  when they where at the club and they were playing rock, paper and scissors. when Dai handed his phone with Shun's name on it I was squealing.
まだまだもっと見たい！！！！
YouTubeで公開されているスピンオフ含め、読後感(?)が良くて本当に最高です。こんなにあったかい気持ちになるリアリティショーがあったんだなぁ… Boys、製作陣のみなさん、本当にありがとう🙏
What a treat ❤ I really missed the show and I was so happy to find this video on my feed today 😍 watching Dai tear up made me tear up again, I love Dai and Shun's love story. It was amazing to see how happy they were watching the show. And what a wholesome show it was! Netflix Japan please make another season of Boyfriend ❤ This is the type of reality tv we all need 😊sending love from Poland to all cast of Boyfriend ❤️🇵🇱🇯🇵
最高まじ満たされる リョウタがシュン気になってるって言った時のダイの反応好き www
First dating/reality show and god i cried a river 😂
Give us the full reaction! 🤍
Tiếc quá khi nó đã kết thúc
Please is there a full video of the reunion?
アランってほんと良い人だなぁって改めて思った🥺言葉のチョイスがとっても上手だし、だれも傷つけない伝え方とか周りをまとめる力ってみんなに備わってるわけじゃないから本当に尊敬する😢みんなに共感して、でも自分の意見もしっかり伝えられるほんとに素晴らしい人！素敵な人！大好き！💗
Alan's emotional intelligence shining through again at the end there, so lovely to see!
Love it❤
That one tear rolling down Dai's face when they were watching the piano scene broke me in the best way 😭😭😭❤
ピアノ弾いてるシーンでダイくん泣いてるの何回見ても泣ける
I loved this show!!!! I hope there is a Season 2!!!
Please show their reaction to episodes 4-10 as well 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼  Tbh I never expected I will love this show so much. Everyone is likable and I learned a lot from each of them. Shun and Dai story is my favorite but I like all of them as well. Thank you Netflix for this wonderful show. I hope for a Season 2.
Pls release the full reaction 🙏🙏
NETFLIX JAPÃO PELO AMOR DE DEUS CADÊ A LEGENDA PARA OS PAÍSES LATINOS???????? NECESSITAMOS PARA ONTEM MINHA FILHA!??!!!!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🇧🇷🆘🆘🆘
アラン先生本日も勉強になりました❤
Dai always in love with shun ❤
I need more drama! Reality show without drama a little bit boring 😅
フル尺で流してほしい😂
視聴が始まったら、シュンとダイが隣同士で見てて 1人で沸いた💕
Will netflix release the rest of the episode reactions?
Will netflix release the rest of the episode reactions?
May I know where are all reaction videos
Why didnt yall tell me ENG Subs were up?! Hahaha
Does anyone know if they are gonna put their reactions to every episode out?  I really want to see that
Subtitulos en español por fa
I loved the simplicity of this series... It was such a breath od fresh air from the chaotic american reality shows where almost everyone is usually loud and so disrespectful... Nerflix should do more of these, maintaining the simplicity of it
Shun is really really really beautiful. Such a pretty face. 😍
I think dai and shun no longer dating. I saw their IG account and they’re not following each other. 😢 i’m curious! Are they really no longer dating??
ONEGAISHIMAS! Please let them watch together until the end of the episode and share it with us please! We already miss them soooo much!
I feel like Alan gives the best genuine hugs
What are they saying ?????
im glad that netflix made dai met shun kun 😭😭😭😭❤
シュンくん変わってる〜！！！ 笑顔が柔らかくなってる🥹 ダイくんが愛してくれてるんだろうね😢❤
Los amo son tan lindos, cuando vienen la próxima temporada ❤😊
X que no en español merecemos que se acuerdes de nosotros todos no hablamos ingles
恋愛リアリティーとか見るの耐えれなと思ってたけど全然面白くて最後まで見れた 是非ともシーズン2をやって欲しい
They should've played the kissing scene of DaiShun
ところで、ゲイorバイの男性に聞きたい。  みんなイケメンで中身も素敵なのはわかるけれど、 当方女性で、テホンさんとゲンセイさんが超絶タイプで、カズトさんもイケメンで料理できて素敵なのはわかるけれど、ここまで一極集中なのは、ゲイが好む何かをカズトさんが持ってるのかな？？
EU GOSTEI DA SÉRIE DA NETFLIX "NAMORADOS". ESPERO Q TENHAMOS OUTRA SÉRIE NO MESMO ESTILO DESSA.❤
now with the power of subtitles..i totaly understand!!yeahhh..yokata!!!
Shun is a pain in the ass. Sorry, but I can't swallow him at all, he acts like a spoiled kid even though he's already an adult. Come on. GROW UP and stop trying to get all spotlights on you like a DRAMA QUEEN. Dai is the MOST patient and caring person ever, I couldn't handle Shun throwing tantrum everyday.
en español por favorrr
Why's Dai crying?
Ini kapan videonya keluar ?
Subtitles in Portuguese please
there must be the watch party 4-10. can't wait ! please make it as long as you can and show the detail.
ME ENCANTÓ VERLOS A TODOS REUNIDOS NUEVAMENTE, SON ALEGRES, SENSIBLES, ESPONTÁNEOS Y PRINCIPALMENTE  EDUCADOS, SI HAY ALGO QUE ADMIRO DE LOS ASIÁTICOS ES ESO, SUS MODALES Y EL RESPETO QUE TIENEN HACIA LOS DEMÁS. FELICITACIONES POR LA SERIE, AUNQUE LLORÉ BASTANTE , FUE LINDO CONOCER LA HISTORIA DE CADA UNO❤
idk why people are watching without subs when there is a button for subtitles/closed captions
1:27 Usak es demasiado cute para ese cuerpote. Ay cosita, yo lloré cuando él se despidió. Lindo mensaje el de Alan al final.
AGHHH so happy to see them all again! You're one of my fav group of people, one of the best cast like His Man S2. I love you guys!  At Netflix, please release all their reactions 🙏🏾  Are DaiShun wearing couple rings? When Dai cried, my heart hurt. 😢 Did KazutoAlan continue to date? Did Taeheon come out to his family? Can the cast members share their relationship statuses with us please? Dating or single?  I really loved this deep and moving show, it was not just about dating but also about friendship and coexistence. And the relationships and interactions were all meaningful, I personally prefer these types of connections compared to some dating shows which seem to focus on lust and sex. Well done to the makers of the show, thank you for not taking advantage of the cast members' traumas and difficulties.   Highly recommend watching The Boyfriend; you don't have to be LGBTQ to relate to it either.  Arigatou gozaimaseu!  Love from the U.K (also Nigeria & Egypt too)! ❤  Edited: My questions were answered watching the interview with the cast. 🥰🥲👏🏾🎉 https://www.youtube.com/live/m-vRG7M7Arg?si=ekZGXO6gAXqCDDbu
gosh i love them.... i giggled every episode.. Gonna miss watching this.. 10 epi not enough :(
美しいダイはいつも自分の気持ちを表現した 6:28

ゲンセイとアランとリョウタとユウサク可愛い…尊い！！❤ でも箱推しなんやけどな！！
うわあーーーー めちゃくちゃ良い…！！！ みんな大好き！！！みんなほんとに優しくて最高のメンバーでした！！！😭
鶏胸肉ほんとにめちゃくちゃ笑ったwwwww
ずっと思ってたけど、シュンってPENTAGONのホンソクに似てるよね…？
Nearly halfway through, had to stop after Dai's interview! OMGG why do they have to watch this together🥲😂😭😫
だーれが12分で足りるって言った？？？ もうほんといい加減にしてぇ🫶🥲
The tears coming down Dai’s face say everything about this wonderful show. The kindness and sincerity of those 9 human beings are so special. First time ever in a reality show. Thank you production team and most of all thank you to the wonderful protagonists. ❤
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
だいの涙😭
❤❤❤
DaiShun ❤
また新しいのやってんなーくらいしか思ってたけど、ボーイフレンドってそういうこと！？観ます
พวกเขาน่ารักมาก ทำให้ฉันเขิน 🇹🇭🩷🇯🇵
未公開と4話以降のwatching partyもお願いしたいです🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️
Please uploaded full episode
this beautiful misunderstanding 🤭
Thank you for the English captions!!! ❤❤❤
Subtitles portugueses??? 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
ネトフリさん!! 最高すぎる動画をありがとう!!!
Kyut
ガッツリ1時間番組で見れるのかとおもってネトフリ内で探してたらなくて検索かけたらYouTubeだった！足りない！！もっとみたい！
Eu amo ser bilíngue 🇧🇷

alan remind me of choi siwon very much DHHSSHA
ほんとに最高🔥みんな大好き😭🩷みてて、学ぶことも沢山あったし優しい気持ちになれるしとにかく最高👏
Necesitamos otra temporada ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dai crying=me crying
ゲンセイかわいすぎる😍
So cute
Seeing Dai crying here makes me somewhat emotional. He always wears his heart on his sleeve and is always so sincere in his feelings for Shun. ❤☺️
もっと❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️見せてください❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
シュンも言ってたけど、私も見た目で偏見を持ってた。それを変えてくれたのがダイとアランだよ。ダイはマジで人間性が素晴らしいよ。忍耐力えぐい。どこまでも深い愛を持ってる。皆で見てる時に流した涙、綺麗でもらい泣きした。アラン、アランは来てすぐにムードメイカーになって、皆から愛される存在になったね。アランの笑顔と言葉は皆を正しい方へ導いてくれる。アランの笑顔を見ると自信と勇気が出て来る。
テホンの事、もっともっと見たかった。テホンは優しすぎるからもっと自分を大事に、どんどん幸せになってね。テホンが居てくれた事で皆救われた。
Mga yawa mo
ゲンセイの周りの人を和やかにする温かさと素直さと相手を一番に思いやる心素敵だった
皆、いつまでも幸せにね
全員が違うキャラで全員がそれぞれの輝き放ってたよ✨
素敵な物語と共感と感動と楽しみをありがとう出演者の皆！✨💗🌈🌻🫶🏻テホン、皆、私達も仲間にして🫶🏻🌻🌈✨✨てか勝手にそうさせてもらうからっ！
Please give us the full version !
これぜひ2やってほしいけどここまでいいメンバー集まるのかなあ
ほんと嫌な人が1人もいないの。みんな違ってるのにみんな愛おしい。ヒール役、憎まれ役がいない。なのに飽きないしどんどん引き込まれる、すごく面白い。こんなに心地よく最後までみんなを好きになれるリアリティーショーがあるんだって初めて思えました。 Netflixのスタッフさんの優しく細やかな演出の賜物だと思う。
will we see them watch the other episodes ?
みんなで見るの超楽しい😂😂😂❤
Oh my god i can't believe Daishun are 23 years old. They look matured and I'm just 20 years old never tried dating, i only watch drama and forgot i need to experienced love.😭 I had crushes but i do avoid them cuz I'm lazy to flirt i kinda regret it now I'm so single and jealous of them.😂💀
Watching  this now make me realize  that ryoto was all over the place from dai to shun to kazuto to gensei that was wild.
I really wanna marry alan but I'm a girl 😂
Any idea if we will get a full version of this video?
Dai's tear. What beautiful human emotion!
Please add watch party of 4-10!
カズトかわいすぎるっっ！！
I hope Netflix will release the whole episode of the reaction videos ❤
When will this be available on Netflix
I miss you all!!!😍 love from Philippines 🇵🇭
I want to watch their full reaction video 😢
NETFLIX. WE NEED THE FULL VERSION OF THIS!!!!!
My favourite dai and shun ❤❤❤❤❤
😍😍😍👏👏👏
Love it, plz post more video about this show
I want see in the last episode reaction thati iko expressed his feelings to dai... I want shun reaction 😅😅😅
Hope to have season 2
I want full version of this Netflix 😭.
Daishun may babies and the rest💕💕💕💕💕💕 we love u all.... No matter ur gender is... As long as ur happy.... We respect that🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗🤗🤗.... The boyfriend is the best... DAISHUN is best couple 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼💑💑💑💑💑🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
かずと1番好き、かっこいい🥺
We want another season please 🫰
Netflix please add on other countries Netflix and please in english  Hi
DaiShun were sincerely happy 🥹
Me encantó el video! gracias por compartirlo. Espero que puedan seguir promocionando éstos programas que nos hacen reír, llorar, sufrir y emocionarnos mucho.
Daishunnn daiร้องไห้ ฮื่อออ❤🥹
I thought this is taboo in Japan. Good to see they finally embracing the world of LGBTQ+
Can we expect the full version of this preview? Or is this just the short video?
？
Why is nobody talking about how big kazuto looks?
3回目見てます！ もうハマりすぎて寝不足です。 こんな心の綺麗な人たちが集まるなんて奇跡です。 スタッフの方幸せをありがとうございます。
Netflix can you upload the reaction video but full version. We will wait for another video reaction. We so excited for that
3:12 女性が見てもシュンのキスが1番ドキドキ💓した。てか持って行き方がお上手💋
グリーンボーイズのみんなが幸せならもう何でもいい！と思える最高の物語でした👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
美しいビデオだ！ 残念なことに12分と短すぎる。もっと長い時間、残りのエピソードでもリアクションビデオを公開してほしい！ 時には、彼らが自分の演技に反応するのを見る方が、より興味深く、リアルなのだ。 そうすることで、ショーや彼らの考え方や経験に深みが増す。
my heart underastand it all without any subtitle.. 😍 im gonna miss them specially my daishun heart❤
Thank you so much for English subtitles ❤️❤️❤️
Gracias Netflix LatinoAmerica ! Excelente Serie !! Dai/Shun
Aww I love Shun so muchhh, he’s cute with this hair TvT!!! I love the way he smiles too bc it’s shine like the sun frrrrr!!! im so obsessed with himmm TvT aaaa
Thank you! I looked all over the Internet for this and finally found it here.
Please upload the full vedio, it's too short😣
I think Dai cried in piano scene because after watching it, he realised that Shun was also interested/loved him in the start and was trying to calm him or show his love through small things like this.
本当にいい番組でした。 シュン君の表情が豊かになってて安心しました。海外ではこういう男性だけの恋愛リアリティーショーはあってめっちゃ好きで、いつか日本でやってくれないかな？でもこういう世の中やし難しいかなって思ってたら、やってくれてほんとに毎回キュンキュンしたり号泣したりとても良い時間でした。 これを見て少しでも勇気をだして好きな人に好きと言える人が増えたら良いなって思いました。 残りのウォッチパーティーも配信して欲しいです☻
Rewatching this after watching the MC and the boys live cast. 🙂🙂😊😊
シュンがダイの家族と幸せに過ごしてること聞いてから見ると家族がいない事を話した夜を見てダイが涙を流す理由もわかるしダイの愛が深すぎて尊い
アランが太陽すぎて幸せお裾分けあざす
Dai tulus banget ke Shun 🩷🩵
Alguém por favor traduz isso para o português nos brasileiros merecemos isso Netinhaaaaaaa....😢😢😢😢
Omg I loved it I'm not I want more
THE BOYFRIEND ❤❤❤❤❤
다이 눈물의 의미는 무엇인가요? 울지마 😢
Knowing Dai×shun are together.... I finally can relax now 😊
Oh, he dresses a lot cooler 😎 off the show, too! Plus wears his hairstyle in a much more modern manner as well. Luv, Grey 🤗 😇
Is it me or do U get the distinct impression that Shun was doing some major acting 🎬 on that reality show?   I say this 'cause he' a totally different person off the show than he was on the show!  On the show, he was weird, aloof, strange, moody, cold 🥶 anti-social, introverted, etc.   Off the show... he' outgoing, warm, friendly, sociable, extroverted, NOT weird or strange, etc.   Hmmm... 🤔😒 Luv, Grey 🤗😇
D♭  Fₘ  B♭ₘ  G♭
このボーイズフレンズの挿入曲なんて曲なんだろう。めっちゃ好き
다이 우는거 왜이리 맘이 아프지 ㅠㅠ 둘이 잘어울려~😊❤
Can we PLEASE get uncut footage of them watching the episodes? I need more of these men in my life
😢😢😢😢 coloca legenda em português, por favor 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Traduccion al español! 😢
Are they going to release videos of watch party every Thursday in YT? Like they were only watch ep 1 to 3 so next week is ep 4 to 6?
Dai’s tear 😢 ❤️
Traduz isso pra português tbm poxaaaa
weho sang that song from The Boyfriend?
this show gave me a lot of ups and down emotions! and still makes me happy! i hope they put up a special episode that the couples do some outside dating or activity. it would be fun!
i am happy that now they have put an english sub title! =)
Daishun is very cute couple , I wish Daishun is also together for love❤🎉😊
Daishun ❤
We need the boyfriend 2 same cast except those who coupled hehehehe 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
I love it
DaiShun is the cutest 😭😭😭😭😭
Does anyone know if they’ll be doing more of these? 🥹
Please make a reaction until final episode:)
おばさんの私がキュンキュンして皆んなを応援したくなっちゃうぐらい、皆んな魅力的。恋っていいね。
I loved them all, I resonated with them and I'm sooo happy my best friend suggested this reality show
アランのいい加減にして！大好き笑笑
Finally there's eng sup, thank i enjoyed it my DaiShun couple confirmed
I just want to ask if this has  only 11 minutes long or it has more videos that we have to wait????
#DaiShun hereeee 🔐💜🥹
Totally here for DaiShun .....i can see the body language lol. I'm so happy for them 🎉❤❤
Not them clowning Gensei for misunderstanding 😂😂 He's cute tho
Waoo subtitle is available now
Thank you for the english sub ❤❤❤❤
OMG, this is the most amazing reality show I have ever seen in my life. No, it's the best thing I ever watched in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone in the Green Room is soooooo amazing and cute and loving and kind and awesome... Why do I want to watch 100 more episodes ?
5:03 Dai reaction like bomb exploded on him 😂😅
Thank You so much for The subtitles❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Watching again❤
Plsss full video
Dai is inlove with shun even shun treats him like nothing he always pick shun hehe his a keeper 😊 even he was with the other and having fun but his mind always shun hehe
Want to see more, these guys are healing material ❤ hope we still get a few more clips 🙏
6:23 Seeing Dai tear up - I assume he was feeling the same as I was, probably more intensely, when I watched his sincere feelings toward Shun in that moment. 9:04 "Dai had such sincere feelings for me. I'm glad I got to see that." - Shun 9:20 "Looking back, I realized that I was trying so hard to be there for Shun. But Shun was also so sincere to me too. I realized that again, so thank you." - Dai  Getting to see their reactions to what will be shown to the world adds to the whole experience.  Thanks to Netflix for this beautiful moment.
so when was the actual show filmed if this watch party was 7 month reunion? Was this watch party pretty recent then?
🌹
Yusak❤Kazuto forever.
Subtitles yahoo! Gonna watch this again. Love their friendship and how able to talk about their feelings they are. Great guys.
Thanks for subtitles😊😊😊
シュンくんは 三浦春馬くんに似てるな。 シュンくん俳優になるの？ ボーイフレンドのシーズン2が ありますように
I almost started crying when dai started crying
Dai is too pure for this world
couldn't they prepare a bigger couch?? it looks so uncomfortable :(
Are they going to release the whole video???? 😢
I’m happy for dai and shun❤❤❤, but the only thing I didn’t like about dai and shun is that they are making fun of other members feelings, ik dai is clingy but shun is matire but still he’s also making fun of his frnds feelings, for me thats very sad to see🥲🥲🥲
The way Gensei speaks korean was so cute😂
Queria muito que tivesse em Português, eu Amei assistir Eles 😢❤

戴的眼淚好真實，那一幕俊彈著鋼琴待在旁邊陪伴，兩人真誠對話，被觸動內心，主題曲好好聽鋪陳情節，我也好想哭😢。可以看得出來此刻戴真的很愛俊
全話観てからこの動画を観ました！ ダイくんの涙で「本当にダイくんには幸せになってほしいなっ」…と、強く思い涙しました！😭❤
Muchas  muchas gracias por este hermoso reality!
I love how Netflix Japan highlighted Alan's POV in the end. We can all see how wide Alan's perspective. Thank you Alan for all your advices. Not only the boys in Green Room learned from you, also the viewers learned from all of you guys 💚
6:27 I can't see it, I'm also happy for dai and shun, my heart is moved to see dai crying happily because he managed to get the man he likes since episode 1, I'm happy for both of you, don't break up! and stay together, for shun to reduce the child's ego a little -your child 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really want to see dai and shun reaction to their bond and also kiss😉

I hope they're all doing fine and are happy in life. ❤ And I really hope and pray that ShunDai are still together.❤😥

Anyone else struggling with en captions? I need to watch this
Awww I want English subs :(
こっちも暴かれる時感情移入して小っ恥ずかしくなったwww 鶏むねで泣けるとは思わなかったし 予想外すぎる展開がありすぎて最高だった、余韻
Where can we watch the full episode of this?
見てるとこフルでみたい笑
So they watched just three ep??
My dai and shun ❤

THANKYOU FOR THE ENGLISH SUBTITLE, ILY NETFLIX JAPAAAANNN !!!
本当に尊すぎる これ3話以降の鑑賞会はないのかな？ダイがアランと××してたの知ったときのシュンちゃんのリアクション観たすぎるんだけど
I'm here for the possibility of yusak and kazuto but I'm screaming and crying
DaiShun❤❤❤❤❤❤
This show was amazing so good ❤ made me cry and laugh! They did a gay dating show the correct way love it!
make longer version of Season 2 please ..
Alan and his positive vibes i really Adore him 🥹🖤 and Shun with his pure heart my bias 🥹💞 and Dai with his masculine side and his maturity. i love them sm ❤ miss you guys!!! 😭
全話みせてほしい😭😭😭
テホンさん、かっこい〜😊❤
ダイは集団生活って事分かれよと思う だったら最後までいないで二人で途中でもいいから出ていけばいいのに しかも謝んないし
Oh my 700k views in one day!!!! The power of the boys and daishun hahah
めちゃくちゃよかったー❤ みんな大好き❤
Thanks for English subtitles ❤
That's all? I thought it could be longer, 11 minutes is not enough! I thought now we'll find out who's with whom! For example Kasuto with Usak, Dai and Shun and maybe others that developed after the show! This reunion is really, way too short! 😪😪😪
Thank you Netflix Japan for the English subtitles ❤
外国のファンの方むっちゃいるよな。すげーよ
Taeheon looks so soft and the way he greeted Dai melted me ❤❤
re-watching here 😅❤ Love DaiShun😍 Inlove with Kazuto❤️❤️❤️
しゅんくんが沢山笑うようになっててなんか暖かい気持ちになった‼︎みんなに幸あれ‼︎🌷🌷
おやや！　どうやら番組初公開日に集まってたんですなあ～～　出来栄え見たのもこれが初めてだったんやねぇ～
Rewatching again because now we eng subtitles
シュンくんが一番変わったね。　表情が豊かになったし、明るくなった！
Waiting for the next watch party❤
Liberam a legenda em português 😢😢😢
Thank you for the sub 😊😊😊 Netflix Japan 🥰🥰☺️
I just wanna say that Dai is the purest soul
still looking forward to usak and Kazuto
They way Alan expressed himself in those final words was perfect. He is always so articulate and he expresses himself so well.
Thank you for the Eng subs!! ❤
Usak chicken smoothies parts was so fun!!
Thank you for listening the fans concerns and adding English subtitles ❤❤
ゲンセイが可愛すぎる❤ゲンセイ限定❤
I love watching Dai! Pls let them watch all the episodes together 🙏 Alan and Kazuto are both glowing… are they together? Also, DaiShun pls let them be happy together❤
Seeing them show their good relationship is very precious to me. Sometimes it's friendship, sometimes it's love, but no matter what happens, it's all very BREWtiful~!  I feel so touched along with Dai when I saw the moments he weaved the wonderful memories together with Shun. Everything you guys have been through has inspired me to want to create such a beautiful relationship like this with someone.  I hope you guys will keep in touch and be happy like this forever~!  P.S. Alan with dark hair looks very sexy, I have to say!
Now that l think: Taehoon, Ryota, Gensei, Alan.. they like Shun a lot, Alan even called him sweetheart. Then of course, there is Dai, who has fallen in love with him. This mk me questions the editing. In korea we hv M/B-C tht famous with their evil editing to create some drama. Drama attracts viewers you know? n l feel like Shun had been viewed unfairly by the editing. Can Netflix please release more positive clips of Shun? Cuz..  If he is half as "toxic" as it is portrayed, why do we see the boys loving him? showing him attentions, joking with him n even... having crush on him? Shun's besties are literally the ones with purest hearts, Gensei n Ryota. Don't y'all think these two won't compatible with him if he's tht hard to hang out with? Taehoon the most mature one, also chose Shun to work with him for the last time, eventhou he has no crush on Shun. Shun get so many hates in his IG tht it makes me ache for him. Ppl called him red flag. Do they know what red flag actually means?! He is never using his traumas as excuse to act the way he is, he explained WHY is he the way himself TO DAI: rmb,there were only two of them. We saw how the others share their family problems openly in the green room. Shun is an introvert who used to stand for himself, because he has nobody who would protect him if things go wrong! yet he knew n he still humbly called himself as troublesome. He is aware of his antics. But he can't afford to get hurt again, as his soul full of scars already... And ppl scold him heartlessly to go to psychiatrist instead of dating show? it's like calling ppl with cancer to stay at the hospital instead of attending a party because some @ssh*les can't bear their "troublesome" existence 🙃
しゅんほんと明るくなったなぁ
So who wrote the note to Gensei?
please release the full reaction video. i can watch them for hours😊
Back here again after the having English Subtitles ❤ Thank you
Teahoon is the purest of all'em ❤I like himmm
Thanks for the subtitles ❤
So any couple still dating after the show got over???? Can anyone tell me if you guys know anything.... I'm curious.....
This show was beautiful in so many different ways. It moved my heart. A big thank you to all the cast and crew and to Netflix. ❤
MOREEE PLEASE, I can't live without dai-shun.......
They’ve finally added subtitles 😩😩😩

Tae is not appear in many scene .. i felt bad for them because they will feel embarassing by exposing them ...
Daishun finally able to see their feelings for each other.. i know i didn't have any rights to go inbetween others personal .. but one point i have to say 'dai is so rare person.. please don't leave him shun' and 'dai i know you give your full effects , don't lose that ..
Alan point is right ... They build a good friendship there..
ALAAAAAAAAANNNNN I'M OBSESSED WITH YOU!!!!!!!!
カズト相変わらず可愛くて優しい！本編ではモテすぎたせいか働きすぎてたせいか途中から笑顔が減ってる気がしたので、久々メンバーたちとリラックスしてニコニコしてる姿が見れてよかったです❤本日のボーイフレンドナイトも待機してますー！
They're amazing and truth their feeling comes out also hopefully next about 'The Girlfriend' 😏
Alongside Dai, Alan also cried during the piano scene which is shown in the last few secs.....everybody was so emotional knowing about shun's past ☹️😭😭
Thank you for the english sub, i got to enjoy watching this even more

Thanks for the English subtitles.  I am thrilled that Shun and Dai realised after watching how SINCERE both were to each other and this will surely strengthen their relationship further after the first 3 episodes and even more later.  I can't wait for them to see till the end like how we felt when we watched them.  When will they get to view till the end?
アランの登場でしゅん拗ねそう

Shun's smile is priceless ❤
Thank you so much for the English subtitles ❤
Dai is so precious Omg 😭❤️
I have spent days trying to figure out where the red flag thing came from regarding Shun.  Behold, a panel member.   Netflix, do better. Words have meaning.  If there are incorrect translations, it can lead to unwarranted responses.   Thank you.
Thank you so much for the English translation ❤
Finallyyyyy English sub!!!🎉🎉

Okay, 3 things: 1. can we please have an update on DaiShun after the show ended. With English subtitels, please. Maybe as a special episode????? 2: how are the participants coping with the whole world knowing them and following their story? Especially the 2 very private people Shun and Mr gogo boy? And finally, how can somebody who looks like Shun - absolutely gorgeous - have so little self confidence and trust in life???? Seriously???
みんな幸せな日々を送っててほしいな
ダイとシュンお揃いのリングしてる🥹

Sometimes having lived in Japan for 12 years and studied Japanese to a point where I understood this all feels like a strange choice to go in life, but honestly, watching this tells me it was worth it. Lol. テホンさんもっと見たいな、足りなかった！（笑）
I am in love with this show. It made me smile, laugh and cry a lot. I had so much joy. I must say I love ALL of the boys especially Dai.

ボーイフレンドロスのみんな！！多分わたし的にこの企画のインスパイア元になったと思われる、韓国版ボーイフレンド(というか元祖？)の「ボクらの恋愛シェアハウス」ってやつ見た方がええで！！ シーズン1のが圧倒的にいいんだけど、あれも人間ドラマがあって、とてもキュンキュンだらけなのでボーイフレンドロスはしばらく埋まると思います😌😌(もちろんボーイフレンドも大好き)
I want it in eng sub yr ...

自分もゲイで周りにはカムアしてるけど、、そもそもカムアする必要のない、同性同士でも、異性同士でもなにも変わらない、世の中になったら嬉しいです。 しかも、このリアリティーショーが日本で生まれた事が重要で、そこにお金を出すNetflixが先進的で素晴らしい企業だと思いました。日本の地上波では生まれなかった。

最後のアランくんのコメント素敵だし、とても共感する！  私たちは何かとカテゴライズしたり線引きしがちだけど、みんな同じ人間、仲間なんだって思う気持ちを共有できる人たちが1人でも増えたら、今より色んな人が生きやすくもっと温かい社会になるんだろうな。
過去一番の恋愛リアリティーショー❤️もっと世の中に男性同士の恋愛だったり友情だったり広まるといいな。35になって久々キュンキュンしました💙💖🧡男性同士の恋愛でこんなに嬉しい気持ちになってキュンキュンするのは初めて💓みなさん素敵だからなんだろうなあ🩵またやってほしいなあ🩷
International fans need subtitles please🥰🥰🥰
Why are y'all posting without subtitles, please be considerate to those foreign viewer's who love daishun 🥺
このドラマ、キャストのバランスが最高に良くて、みんな大好き。俳優さんとかじゃなくて、こんな最高なドラマになるの奇跡😊生きててよかった
SVP sous titre en francais ou netflix france  svp
自分たちの出てたレアリティーショーをウォチパしている様子をまた見れる、楽しいー！ありがとう御座います！
Kok gua nangis yak liat pertemuan usak sm kazuto
I don't understand anything but just seeing them all together is already enough for me ❤😊  And dang Kazuto is buff buff I love it 😮 I can't help but think of Usak and him together 😂 He might just be charmed by Usak's chicken breast shake Lol
Me who doesn’t understand a single word of Japanese other than ‘Konnichiwa’ and ‘arigato ’ watching this like I’m gonna get any of the things they’re saying. I just wanna watch them, especially DaiShun. I miss them and I miss Usak.
とにかく全員好き、最高。　恋愛リアリティ史上最高だと思う。
DaiShun Forever.
I wish there would be a full version with eng sub of this reaction video <3
Having so many international fans and not having English subs should a crime. But I love how we collectively stayed despite the language barrier.
Translation pls😭
Me trying to understand what they were saying from jp language comments 🥹
We need the English subtitles
Someone better do subtitles real quick.
I need to learn Japanese for DAISHUN. 🥲
Graag in Nederlandse 😊😮
Somebody needs to sub this plssssss

I didn't understand a thing they said but still I can't stop smiling 😅
netflix japan pleasee include the english subtitles 😭
Hope this is subbed soon 🙏🏽 Ive been watching bits with google translate lens but I just want to watch and read it with ease 🤣
ゲンセイ可愛い♡
I tear up when I see Usak coming in. Really a beautiful soul. Taeheon looks really hot and how come he didn't get more screening time?
Hopefully we get subtitles soon 😭😭
Kazuto is so buff??????
みんなの関係が素敵すぎる
Make Shun smile more, his smile is very beautiful❤
English sub please ❤
5:04 this reaction was so good i was like that too bcz i excepted ryota to say gensei

ダイ、シュンの涙にもらい泣きしちゃう😢
Here is some translations for international fans... I translate with google translate from post watch scene.  During that time, did you ever think, "I wonder if this girl likes this girl?" Like an arrow? From Kazuto's point of view, "I wonder if Dai likes Jun." I thought Dai liked me, not Shun. (Alan) What about Shun? I thought Dai was Kazuto. So things had progressed that much. I had no idea. Didn't Shun say something like, "I'm not interested in anyone yet?" Like, "There's no one I'm interested in." Really? But sometimes, there are so many ups and downs I think it's kind of "nice." It calms me down, but it's impossible. I feel like my feelings are being tossed around. The more time passes, the more certain it becomes. Didn't you say something like, "I like Dai when we're together?" When we're all together, (Dai) tries to cover it up. And it's your misunderstanding that bothers me the most. Right! It's really funny  (Alan) I think I like him the most  (Kazuto) "Because we'll end up in mutual love"  Really funny  Interview Ryota I think people in the world have different views on cars, good and bad, but the time we spent in that place was irreplaceable I know that may sound like an exaggeration, but it was really important and I want to cherish it  Shun I'm glad I got to see that he was so devoted to me  Dai When I looked at it objectively, I realized I was trying my best to be close to Shun I thought it was amazing that he was so close to me, but I was reminded that he was really there for me, so I said "thank you."  Ikuo Even though he wasn't saying anything, I think he was thinking a lot, so I thought a lot of emotions were stirred up and a lot happened in these three episodes.  Gensei I think the thing that surprised me the most was that Ryota was interested in Shun. I didn't expect that, or rather, I thought they were just good friends, so I was a bit surprised by that.  Taehon Green I'm happy that the days I spent with the boys in the Room have turned into something so good, and I'm excited and thrilled to think that people all over the world will be watching it.  Usk When I first bought chicken breast, I was a bit shocked, like, "I knew it was like this at this point." I was stepping on the electric current quite a bit at this point.  Kazuto I think I would probably feel anxious if I was alone, so I was relieved to be able to watch it with everyone.  Alan It's a reality show for men, but it doesn't matter if you're male, female, age, or gender, and it's really valuable to have more people who think, "We have something in common," or "I understand how you feel," or "We're the same kind of people," or "I'm gay," or "I'd love to be one of those people who like men," or "I've had these feelings, and I understand how you feel," or "I hope I can convey that properly.
Pls translate in English
All i need to know is are they together or nothing till date?

This show is a lingering feeling to me thats why without subtitles i am still laughing.. crying and feeling emotional too...🤗☺
お願いだから全話分のこの感じ見たい！！！！！！！！！！ 12分は短すぎるので1時間にしてくださいお願いします！！！！！
I reckon Dai cried because on the screen it was the same evening Shun opened up about his childhood which emotionally got them closer..perhaps it brought back the sadness he felt on the same evening for Shun, about his childhood
アランの誰も傷つけない言い回しホントに好き。みんな言ってるけど私も友達になりたい！！

Eng subtitles 😢
I'm so sorry you didn't activate the CC button for subtitles. We are many international fans who have seen this Japanese reality show, maybe you will think of us too. I watched for 12 minutes without understanding anything...but I intuited a little something (vaguely) making a correlation with the chronological sequence of events in the Green Room.
Daishun fan from Philippines ❤❤❤
全部の反応みたい！ウォッチパーティ後半もお願いします！
俺の楽しみが終わっちまった マジでみんな幸せになってくれ
I want to understand what they're saying😢

私は異性愛なので、こう言った番組で彼らが何に悩むとかが少しでも理解できてよかったし、恋愛や友情、人間関係、人間性はみんな一緒ってことを再認識できてよかった☺️ これからの世界を生きていく人には絶対必要。最高の番組だと思う。
I'm smiling the whole time even if I don't understand😅
ぜひフルバージョンを！！ ボーイズがみんな本当にそれぞれ魅力的で大好きな番組です♡

Okay international fans including Daishun shippers, heres rough translation  Dai:Teaheon-San! Teaheon: Dai-Chan! Dai: it’s been a while! Teaheon: How have you been? Dai: Ive been doing great  Dai: Here he comes! Ryota: Long time no see Dai: Ryota~ Model-san It’s been a long time since we met last time Ryota: I’m so nervous  Dai: since we haven't met after shooting  Gensei: Hello Nice to meet you 	I move in this house from today Dai: You seem you are doing great Taeheon: It has been a while Gensei:Heyyy You are so stylish (He is saying he is skinny to Ryota but it’s probably a compliment in Japanese culture)  Dai: He is coming        Heyyyy Dai: You are so greedy hahaha  All; wow ?:It’s been long time Gensei: You so tanned  Dai:so tanned more than last time we met Kazuto: Ryota how have you been? Ryota: I have been doing great  Usak:Helloo All:It has been a while Usak;Hey Shunn Kazuto:SHUN!?!? Shun:You so buff   Kazuto: You haven’t changed that much in a good way Gensei:You’ve changed so much Kazuto: I probably have the most I gained weight a lort haha  Alan: Whats going on? Hahaha Excuse me?? LOL Do you wanna hug like the time we did?? AHHHHHH  Ikuo:Heyyy Dai; Hellooo Gensei; Here he comes!!!!  We all together  Alan:Yeah we are all here Alan: You so cute(kawaii) Shun: Thank you! Alam: We need time to check each of us haha bcuz we are too excited now haha  TeaHeon:You guys see each other for the first time Ikuo and Usak?? Alan:Yeah they do! Ryota: Usake went and Ikuo came at that time Usak: We didn’t see each other in the house Shun: Did you know Usak? Ikuo:Yeah I know him (ofc Usak is famous dancer…) Dai; This is Tara-chan (Usak is good at mimicking the voice of the character in Japan Tara-chan from the anime called Sazae-san)  Ryota: Idk until when is for ep 3 Dai?:I know right? I am so curious until when is for ep 3 too  [Today is for watchparty for ep1-3 with all boys]  Alan; I feel so happy to live now dont you think so?  Netflix sound  AHHHHHHH  Alan:OMG you guys looks enjoying a lott  Alan: OH MY GOD ALL:EHHHHHHHH  Kazuto: Oh wow guys….  All:FOOOOOO  “There is only one option for me.. Its Shun”  Alan: You liked Shun from the beginning!!!  “Id tell him how I feel for him first although I can’t write my name on the letter and he can’t tell it is from me”  Shun:Oh no I’m gonna cry  “I feel like handwriting will be the key to know who is who”  “The letter is from Ryota, I guess?? He has feelings to me??”  Kazuto: Kawaii (so cute) Alan: You misunderstood??  “I wriote a letter to Dai”  “I can’t say that in front of him..”  Kazuro: Did you like him?? Alan: EXCUSE ME?? LOL omg it’s shun???   ~After gensei talking in the show~  Gensei:I am so embarassed Alan: You thought the letter was from Ryota too right? Gensei: I did haha  ~after the scene Dai and Shun playing the piano~ Alan: Thats so cute  ~After ep3 ended~ Dai: OMG  Alan:Excuse meeee???? Shun:Oh my.. Dai;I am also curious about the story after this   Alan: Did you guys know who likes who at that time?? Dai:Like relationship chart? Alan; for example, from Kazuto’s point of view. Dai probably likes him Kazuto: Actually, I thought Dai likes me not Shun  All:AHAHAHAHAHA Alan; How about Shun? Shun: I thought Dai liked Kazuto too  Usak: I didn’t know that you guys moving that much Didn’t you say “I have nothing” around that time Shun? Like “I don’t have any feelings to anyone here Shun:No I didn’t Usal: Was that true? Shun: But sometimes like going up and down I mean.. Sometimes I felt Dai is a green flag bcuz I am comfortable with him, but I felt nah he is not my man  Alan:Being taken by a ride by Dai will be conviction which shun likes Dai as time passes right? Kazuto:You didn’t say you liked Dai being with me Shun? Shun:Yeah I did Dai tend to patch things up for the moment when we all together  Alan:Then we need to move on to your misunderstanding which is the most  interesting  Gensei:YEAH!  Dai:Thats so funny for real Alan: I think its the best part  Kazuto: “We might love each other…(mimicking gensei)” Dai: “I can do nothing bcuz we might love each other soon” Alan:THAT is so funny  Interview part  Ryota I think some people think it is good, others think it is bad, but the fact we spend time together there is the most important thing for us, I might be a bit extra tho but still I wanna cherish this memory  Shun Dai devoted me  I was glad to see that  Dai I realized that I thought I tried to be with him mentally so hard, he also does to me with an objective eye. So I reconformed it and i wanna say thank you to him  Ikuo I think Everyone has many thoughts while they are not actually saying. There were so many emotional movement in ep 3  Gensei I was so surprised that Ryota had feelings for Shun I didnt even think about it I thought they were just close friends so surprised  Teaheon I was so happy that the time I spent with boys in Green room became such a good show and I am so excited a bit nervous that many people in the word watch this.  Usak I was so shocked when i bought chicken breast for the first time, Dai was kinda mad about it  I was like ah I already irritated Dai at this point  Kazuto I was so relieved since we can watch it together   i would be so nervous when I watch it by myself   Alan While it is a reality show done by all male members, male, female age and gender don’ t matter that much actually. It would be precious audiences think “we relate this!” or “Ive had thins feelings too”. So I would be happy if I can tell the audiences that we are all the same bcuz we are human beings not only for gays.
I dont know what is more hurtful  watching dai tearing up or watching this without subtitles 😢
No subs but still watching😂
Sub Thai plz
何十回と見返した❤ みんな 魅力的で素敵💓

Shun is pictured as the most dramatic person in this show, but he’s also the most adorable one. We can see that he can be fun, dramatic, queen bee, competitive, sensitive, genuine, and loving

SUBTITLES PLEASE
俺男で恋愛リアリティショー大っ嫌いだったけど試しに見てみたら面白くて全部見てしまった。恋愛どうこう以前に人間として学ぶところがたくさんあったし、男同士の恋愛ってこんなにピュアなんだって思った。ゲイのこと嫌がる人はいるけどそういう性的マイノリティーの人がこんな感じに生き生きできる社会になったらすごい素敵だよな。ちなみに俺はテホン推しだぜ。
Y los subtítulos para los que no hablamos japonés por lo menos pongan subtítulos en inglés porfis para las fans de latinoamérica y otras áreas del mundo
O abraço do Alan tão caloroso nos meninos, ele é um querido mesmo.❤
🥺😍
オールスター嬉しすぎます❤
Daiiii 🥺
最初にダイ、次にテホンさん部屋に入れるのスタッフわかってるよね〜 season2はもっと長期でやってほしいなぁ
Sub español,  please!
ピアノのくだり、ダイの泣き顔が少し寂しそうなのが気になる……ふたり良い関係で続いててほしい…！！！

お互いにどう矢印が向いてると思ってたかの話のときの、カズトの「ダイが俺のこと好きだと勘違いしてた」は、ゲンセイへの優しさにも感じる。カズト好き！！
Where is the subtitles?????

登場順が本編の登場順で既に感動！ 皆が元気そうで嬉しかったです！ 改めて自分たちの作品を鑑賞するのどんな気持ちだったんだろう🥹 こっちは何度も泣かせて頂き、同時に成長させてもらいました。 この作品に出逢えたのが私の中での宝物です。 こんなにも何度も見返して楽しめる作品は今までにありませんでした。 この動画もそうだし、一晩でこんなにも再生数があって、絶対需要があるので、もっと未公開や皆での会話シーン見てみたいです。
みんなでぱって出てくるのもいいけどみんなの登場順に出てきたり、ゲンセイさんのコメントがりょうたくんでシュンくんのコメントがダイくんだったり大満足、、
English subtitles plsss 😢😢😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

Tengo una duda shun y dai si se volvieron pareja o son solo amigos ? Es curiosidad
Damn I love them all
Las reacciones de Dai son las mejores 😂... Pero bebé no llores 😢 No entendí nada, pero estoy feliz de verlos a todos
Some thoughts:  1) Dai and Shun are clearly together and very happily so ❤ Love them and the whole cast so much! 2) I would actually pay good money to see their unedited reactions to all episodes. This is so short 😢 3) Cannot wait for the live on Sat... 4) ...and a new season asap 🙏 5) We need subtitles to everything related to this masterpiece of a series
Por favor en español, aún sin entender me encantó este programa 🥰
うん。Netflixごめんこれだけ言わせて？？？ テホンくんにスポットライトを当てなかったのなんで？！？！ お茶目テホン可愛かったからちょっと許すけど…。 あとイクオくんへのダイからの謝罪シーンあるなら出しなｯｯｯｯﾂ‼︎‼︎ 構成上、人間ドラマにしたいのは分かる。YouTube上でいいから出してくれ。私の心が報われない。
Necesito los subtitulos en español por favor❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
So i dont understand, so please just tell me, DaiShun are still together or not? They confirmed?
みんな可愛すぎるしかっこよすぎ！ YouTubeやってほしーーー たりなーーーーーい
どんな政治家の言葉や 学校の教科書よりも ボーイフレンド見せた方が LGBTへの理解が深まると 思います❤
この人たち、全員と友達になりたい❤
ダイくんの笑顔がなによりも私の癒し✨

Netflix Japan... subtitle please 🙏☺️
SUBTITULOS ESPAÑOL
English captions please!!!! 😅
PLEASE ADD SUBS
Libera a tradução 🇧🇷😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 11:53
We need English subs !!!❤❤❤
This is frustrating..Let them declare more whether they are together or not..at least they owe it to their fans..MMS or NetflixJapan are obliged to announce it because it is about the reality show The boyfriend..It is not a K drama or a BL drama and they're not actors so let's hide..They participated in a reality show to find a boyfriend..so I guess we need to know if the reality show  got an official couple at the end
Subtitulos por favor!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
I want to understand every bit of their conversation but no subtitles. Smiling giggling and Watching without understanding a thing...
Can you please put a English subtitle?
OMGGGGG
Why is so short???
afinal, shun e dai estão juntos?
Please please, add subtitles for inter fans, I'm gonna watch the video anyway even if I don't understand but I would love to rewatch and laugh with them
Debieron poner sus en español
Onde está a tradução para o inglês, por exemplo. 🤔
Siguen juntos la pareja principal
アランの言葉ってほんとありがたい。 同性が好きが先行するんじゃなくて、好きになったのが同性だったってだけで、好きって感情は人類共通で、かけがえのないものなんだなって思わせてくれる。 ありがとう～アラン！ ありがとう～グリーンルーム！ ありがとう～鳥胸肉。ユーサクさん良すぎ。

I was smiling throughout ( I didn't understand a word of what they said) I'll never be able to move on from this show, tbh I never want to. All my love to DaiShun and the whole cast💗💗😭😭
Dai I love you ❤ DAI DAI DAI DAI = The best boy 🫂👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
"Dai, don't cry. You are the best for Shun, and I don't think anyone can love Shun like you do. If Shun has any other relationships, they won't be as pure as your relationship with Shun. If anything bad happens in the future, don't cry, Dai. I am sure you are an understanding and kind partner. I believe you are the best person, and I pray to God that both of you have a bright future and a long-lasting relationship. I believe the whole world wants Daishun together always."
I didn't understand a single word, But i can feel there emotions 😭🫂
😍😍😍
can someone please translate this in their channel?? i don't understand a thing😭😭
Netflixさん、これ副音声で加えてください！！
I don t have a clue what they are saying but just happy to see there faces and friendship.
irmao tendi nada mas to vendo
WE NEED ENGLISH SUBTITLES 😢
More than 300k views in less than 7hrs!! The world loves the show!!! Upload the English captions, please!!
*このシリーズが大好きで、すべてのエピソードを見ました、ビッグキス!*
No entendí lo que dijeron... pero que lindo 🥺❤️  Dai te amo ✨💗
もっと長く見たい！！！！
Gente que lindo amei velos todos juntos que deus abençoe essas pessoas maravilhosas espero vê mas sopre eles ❤❤❤❤❤
Watching like a pro without eng sub coz why not😊i loved the show.. Adored daishun n wish all love
😢 Here is more useless than TikTok... somebody put subtitles please aaargh
Netflix better give us subtitles. We international fans missed them equally too ugh 😔
English subtitles pls!!!!
To everyone saying they may not be in a relationship and may be are only on good terms as friends, what about the tiktok videos of them together which they saved? Friends do that? Call each other each other's sun and moon? What about Dai's mom's comment on Shun's photoshoot picture? Yeah, just friends right? What about them wearing each other's clothes? Dai wearing shun's jacket in one his insta post? The picture of them together at a freinds party? Them using the same gym? Now to those saying they aren't acting couply. You know they were part of a dating show right? These shows ask them to keep their current status hidden. They will want probably the 9th 10th episode reaction to reveal everything because that will profit Netflix more. They know people like us are waiting to know whats up with Dai and Shun. Also it must be benefiting Dai and Shun too. The hype they are getting they know to increase it even more they need to keep the relationship a secret for as long as the content related to show are yet to come. Also, about their actions towards each other in this video arent enough for you to come up with assumptions. Do you want them to make out in front of everyone? And it is only 12 mins of the whole thing. They met, watched 3 episodes and then shared their views and talked about life in the green house. Do you think Netflix will give us content that will make it clear that they are in a relationship when 4 such videos are yet to come? They want us to be curious about them. And both Dai and Shun unfollowed everyone, it is also a move to make us curious. So be patient and wait for other reaction videos. And stop with your assumptions about their break up. I am having a good day, dont make it a bad one.
Y los subtitulos para los que no sabemos japonés?
Please upload captions. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
love all the international fans here watching not knowing a damn thing they're saying LMAO
My question I hope someone confirms that they are boyfriend and girlfriend or they are no longer shun and dai❤
英語の字幕を追加してください 🙏 私はボーイフレンドが大好きなので、未公開のクリップや追加素材をすべて視聴できるようにしたいです 🥺💗 / スウェーデンからのファン
If Netflix Japan needs someone to translate this to English I’d do it for free in an hourrrrrr

7 months after leaving Green room. Boys gathered again to watch first three episodes before official releasing.  Dai is crying when he realized how Shun was supportive and his side. Shun is also about to cry when he found out Dai had feeling for Shun from the very beginning.
😭😭😭 seeing them together again  😅😅😅i didn't understand what they were talking
Is it the full special episode?
مو فاهمه ولا كلمة لكن كفاية ضحكاتهم🥹🥹طول المقطع والابتسامة شاقة وجهي خصوصا نظرات ولمسات daishun❤️❤️

6:28  we did not see this face in Dai in all 10 episodes, and he had reason to be sad in this 10 episodes but he never show it (because he had little hope)
Dai’s Casio watch is as consistent as his love for shun 😅❤❤

LOS AMO CHICOS❤
Quiero subtítulos por lo menos en inglés por favor😢
Please Netflix JP give us subtitles PLEASE I BEG U 😭
What I can understand using google (thanks!) is that today they only watch episode 1 to 3. The first impression they have for each other,  Shun was touched by Dai's words about him during the "letter time", he undersand a little bit more Dai's feelings at the beginning of the show. Dai is thanksful to Shun being by his side (piano time). So basically not much information about their actual relationship but... 🤞🏻 Keep hoping ShunDai - DaiShun lovers 😉
Sub pleaseeeeeeeeeee🙏❤
Eng sub pls .
No entiendo nada pero estoy aqui para ver al Daishun
アランの性格の良さが飛び抜けてた✨ ここでもイクオの席が無くて、真っ先に自分が床に座ったり、自然と周り見れてて人間性が凄いので見習いたい。 テホンの言葉も響いたし、カズトの優しさも、ユーサクの面白さも大好きだった！
Please add English subs😭    Anyhow Im watching it!❤

Eng sub plz

please tell me that they will release the full reunion ep and not just this little bit
Please translate
Just happy watching the boys smile ❤
Dai crying is too much ❤
RYOTA❤❤❤❤❤
DaiShun are the reason for me watching this with no English subs! I love them with all my heart! I am so happy to see them still a couple and still being so close and cute when they are together. Their chemistry is insane and their love story moves me to tears every single time. I don't think I have been this invested in a real couple ever in my life. They need to get married and have kids and Netflix should have a documentary or live series for their relationship growth and even their wedding day. Everyone will watch it. So many people love their love!
🤮
6:25 Dai kun I just can’t 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 It feels like they are not together anymore the way he cried. As long as u both are happy can’t ask more than this Take care 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Subtituloooss porfaa
Tradúzcanlo al español por favor, necesito entender todo 🥲
良い作品😮
It would be so interesting to watch them to reflect and discuss more in depth the whole show, how are the stories shown to us and so on. Because they lived there and I can only presume much more was going on, f.e. we didn't see Shun or Taehon (or even some others) in much more interactions than those that serve the main picked stories, but they are all interesting and the others also say so.... Also seeing themselves like this must be very strange, uncovering hidden moments, it might tackle some difficult emotions.
DaiShun ♡
Noooo y los subtítulos en español 😢
Duh !! I'm back again 😭 ( was hoping for a eng sub 😢) Netflix Jpn กรุณาเพิ่มคำบรรยายภาษาอังกฤษ 5โมงกว่าแล้ว😢🙏🏻🙏🏻

English Subtitle Please! 🥺🥺🥺
え？これって4話目以降もあるのかな？ 絶対あってほしい！
Could you please add English subtitles to this video? I would greatly appreciate it, and I believe others who don't understand Japanese would also benefit from knowing what's happening in the video. It would be really helpful! Thank you so much! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😁

Saudades de todosss  Amooo muitooo❤❤❤ Pena que não tem tradução 😢
Amei, perfeito.
Dai啊 去看看ins上Gensei的野生眉教程吧
I think we saw so many sides of Shun and the walls that he has put up within himself that it was painful at times to watch. Dai little by little was and hopefully is still breaking those walls down.
Couple ring :>
Where to watch their whole reaction??? Full video
Dear Netflix Japan, please consider putting Engsub for international fans as well cause we would like to know what they were saying too
After watching this, dai fell in love with shun all over again ❤
Already miss this boys  May they find happiness in their life  Truly it was wonderful show with wonderful people and also with wonderful host  Looking forward for more
Didn't understand a single word but i smiled with them throughout the video 😭
You are all talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before ❤
Dai my boy u r sooo in love. U r soo cute 🥰🥰🥰 I hope u and shun will be forever ♾️ together. I love u both ❤️
libera a legenda Netflix
English subtitles pls
これ、ネットフリックスの本編にも流してほしい。ずっと思ってたけど、バチェラーのアフタートークみたいなのってすごい重要で、本編では編集上、意地悪だったり自分勝手に見えてしまう参加者が「意外と可愛らしい人じゃん！」って視聴者に理解させる重要な場だと思う。  本人の良い面が見えたり、弁明が出来る動画を（YouTubeやショートではなく）本編にあげて、執拗なアンチを避けるべき。
Por qué Netflix no facilita la traducción a otros idiomas? Es un reality que ha tenido un éxito impresionante y mucho impacto. Y estos 12 minutos son muy emocionantes también para el espectador de cualquier lugar. Será que incorpora Netflix la traducción'
We need eng sub
eng sub please 🥲
I came here cuz I saw a clip and thought it was a reunion
Please add English subtitles 🥺

I M in love with Dai
i need the english subtitles 😢
So. It was recorded before the series published?
Guy I have a few things I want to say about usak and kazuto. When I did a little digging, both of them apparently posted pictures at the same place approximately. like the same like date too like it wasn't very off like for example it was on July 16 and the other one posted on July 20, July 23 basically. And the thing is they started wearing the bracelet about like the same time as well and then now I look at it and I'm looking at Alan. And like he doesn't have any bracelet and I'm just confused because they walked out the house together, right? It's only them who has like the matching bracelet aside from dai and shun since there are a couple.
Look at DaiShun guys. They are glowing
Cadê a legenda??? @netflixbrasil faz alguma coisa
english subs please
Já quero esse vídeo dublado
I am laughing like hell without  understanding a single Japanese

I NEED CAPTIONS😭😭
Bien sûr je n ai pas tout compris,  vu qu il n y a pas de traduction en français,  mais leur bonheur de se retrouver dépasse tous les mots.  Je suis heureuse de voir que Dai et Shun sont toujours amoureux et heureux ensemble, voir Shun être détendu, rire et sourire me rend tellement heureuse,  ce petit a fait du chemin et c est le signe qu il se sent bien avec Dai... je leur souhaite toute une vie de bonheur, ce petit couple m a énormément touchée et émue. Et les larmes de Dai veulent tout dire.🥹 Cette émission est une pépite,  de fraternité,  de tolérance,  de bienveillance,  d amitié et d amour.  J espère que tous ces jeunes gens resteront amis toute leur vie. Je leur souhaite que le meilleur et que chacun trouve l amour 💖🥰
Por favor permitan las traducciones, desde Latam
Нічого не зрозуміла, але посміхалась ціле відео. ДайШун ❤

Where are the subtitles please?? 😢
Was watching hoping I could get the cc for it but enjoyed it. Hope DaiShun are still together, initially didn’t think I’d like the show with the side commentary from the panel but surprisingly it gave it a good twist almost felt we all where in the room watching them together. Having them say what you had in mind. Loved the glow on Dai and Shun, honestly Dai is a complete romantic. ❤❤❤
Please make season 2 with longer episodes
After The Boyfriend ended, I am having separation anxiety from all the casts 🥺 I want to watch them more, or even hug them and give them my hopes & wishes for all 9 of them. Feels like I wanna see them everyday happy with their oives 🫶
Who's watching the video and read Japanese comments section with translation? 🙋🏽‍♀️

Tabang way english ani? HAHAHAHAHAHA
I just don't understand, it's official Netflix Japan which release this reaction video. and we all know, Netflix is an expert with subs/audio option and what not... IS THAT HARDDDD to give multiple subs for this beautiful-important reunion video for us fans. Is it has any matters with copyrights issue if this was subbed???
I love u Dai 💕
Beside Shun and Dai, I hope Kazuto and Alan still together in real life
🥺🥺🥺🔪...so ciu
Im sorry but i felt like the reason why Dai cried when there is a flashback video of him with Shun while playing the piano is that Dai misses it and maybe something happened after the show. I hope im wrong huhu. My DaiShun heart 🥺😭
Why is there no translation?! 🥺You make me jealous of anyone who knows Japanese 🙂‍↔️
ゲンセイの「細いね」が「顔色悪いからメークしていい」くらい笑った
Shun and Dai aren't sitting next to each other

Taeheon is so hot I cannot.
No subtitles....
Where to watch in english subtitles?
Even though theres no subtitle on it, i kinda get... Im so glad that shunxdai was the end game--but its making me sad because its done. THE BOYFRIEND SEASON 1 IS SIGNING OFF. I JUST HOPE THAT THEY WILL LAUNCH NEW SEASON. and The boyfriend will do a live.
I didn't understand anything, but just hearing Dai's laugh and seeing that he is still the same boy with that beautiful energy was enough to make me happy today. It hurt me a lot to see him cry, Dai is a huge green forest and I don't want anyone to hurt him, he deserves everything beautiful in this world. I'm going to miss him so much, but I know that through his networks I will be able to know that he is really well. Dai did not teach many things and therefore will always have a special place in our hearts, many thanks to Netflix for allowing us to meet such a wonderful being as Dai ❤
3:11 😭😭 that cute reaction
テホンさん両親に伝えられたのかな テホンさんかわいかった大好きです

I am not understanding anything as there is no subtitles but Dai please don't cry. You deserve the whole world. Be happy with someone who makes you happy. It doesn't matter the person is Shun or someone else. Just be happy. Because in this world a soul like you is very hard to find . Dai be happy always. We will always be there for you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Rough translation for the video about their getting together after 7 months of leaving the Green Room:  Taehon coming in Dai: Taehon-san! Taehon: Daichan, Long time no see! Are you doing well? Dai: I’m great   Ryota coming in Dai: Here he is!  Taehon: Mr. Model! Ryota: So nervous! Long time no see  Gensei coming in Gensei: Nice to meet you (acting as if he was the first he meets everyone :))) ) Dai: Nice to meet you???  Gensei: I’m joining the house from today! Hugging Ryota and said: “Such slim body!”   Shun coming in Dai: Here he is! Dai looked at Shun hugging Gensei + Ryota and said: Such a greedy hug!   Kazuto coming in Everybody yells: You are so burnt! (Dark skin)  Yusak coming in Yusak: Long time no see Shun! Shun: You are huge! Everybody: Long time no see  Kazuto: Taehon-san does not change at all Gensei: Kazuto, you are the one that has changed the most :) Kazuto: I gained some weight :))   Alan coming in Alan: Ohhhh! What's the meaning of this?? This is just tooo much!! Let's hug like the first time?? Everyone greets him and lots of huggies.  Ikuo coming  Gensei yells: Here he comes Everyone greets and hugs   ——————————————— Someone(S): all of the members are here!!  Alan: Shun, you look so cute! I need much more time to really have a good view at everyone’s face.  Taehon: I think Ikuo and Yusak first meet each other. Ryota: Yeah they switched with each other Ikuo: But I kinda know his name! Yusak: You can call me Tarachan(since there was en episode of him mimicking a character in Sazae-san anime series) Ryota: I’m not sure where the third episode ends Everyone: Yeah, yeah. Until when is the third episode!  SUBTITLE: Today, everybody will only watch episode 1 to 3  Alan: It’s so good to be alive!! Everyone: screaming~~~ Alan: Everyone in this scene is just having so much fun!!! Alan: Oh my god~~~   Lots of clapping and screaming!!  The series's opening BGM is played.  Then we can see again the flashback of episode 1 when Dai confessed he had feeling for Shun at the very first sight. Shun: Oh.. mine…. I may cry  Then is the scene of Ryota and Gensei’s first coffee truck shift in which Gensei mistook that Ryota was the one who had written the letter for him.  Kazuto: Oh so cute! Alan: So it meant you misunderstood?  Next, Ryota confessed in the episode that he had someone in mind and it was actually Shun.  Everyone panicked and got shocked since they know this for the first time. Alan: Are you kidding me!!! Shun?? For real? Gensei commented “Oh I am so embarrassed” after seeing his scene saying that the letter is for him and Ryota may have feeling for him :)  Then, the scene in which Dai said that Yusak should consider the budget used for the whole house was shown.  After that, the scene in which Shun and Dai shared a special moment was also shown.  This scene makes Dai feel really emotional and tears swell up in his eyes. He cried for a good 30 seconds of this clip^^  After that we were brought back to the scene in which Shun said his emotions for Dai faded away after their first date to the aquarium. Then as you all remember, this ended the episode 3! So everyone begs to see more especially Dai.  —————————————  Alan: While living together, do you guys happen to guess if this guy has feeling for that guy? Dai: Like, who like whom? Alan: Yeah yeah. By the way, Kazuto, how’s about you? Like, did you have a feeling that Dai liked Shun at some point? Kazuto: Actually.. I thought Dai was the one who liked me! Everyone burst into laughters  Alan: Shun, how’s about you? Shun: I thought Dai liked Kazuto at one point!  Yusak: Shun, you said that you actually did not have feeling for anyone right. Shun: Yeah at first. Then, sometimes my feeling for Dai grew a bit stronger but it also faded away quickly. My feeling is like a roller coaster.   Alan: So it’s like you are controlled by your own feeling~ Kazuto: Didn't you say that you liked Dai better when you 2 guys are only together? Shun: yeah yeah, when he is with everyone, he is just too much.  Taehon: But the most surprising thing is Gensei’s misunderstanding about Ryota! Gensei: So! Dai: It’s so amusing! Kazuto: Gensei’s thinking “Oh mine, we might end up liking each other” is just so cute Alan: I think I like it the best!  Gensei repeated his phrase in the series: "No no it’s not the time now for us to fall for each other" and then got more embarrassed :)   —————————————  Ryota: Everyone has their own views so they will have many different thoughts about this series. But for me the moments spent with them are like treasures. It’s so important to me  Shun: I was so touched when he thought only about me this whole time. I am happy to see those moments of Dai  Dai: I am so surprised that Shun actually also grew his feelings towards me. I thought I was the only one chasing after him. Thanks so much for letting me those moments about him.  Ikuo: There are a lot of things going on in one’s mind even though we cannot say them out loud. So there must have been a lot of emotions as well. That’s why I think episodes 1-3 are such great content.  Gensei: Ryota’s having feelings for Shun was the most surprising thing to know for me. I was totally taken aback. I just thought they were good friends…  Teahon: It was so happy to see those moments we spend together in the Green room was potrayed in such a wonderful way so I cannot wait for the world to see it.  Yusak: The first time I bought the chicken meat over the budget was like stepping into the landmine! Now I know..  Kazuto: If I was to see it by myself, it must be very terrifying but seeing it with everyone is just a relief.  Alan: When this series is released to the world, I think everyone can share some common experiences, no matter their sexuality, age, or race. “Yeah, I have this kind of feeling too!” is what I think many people will feel after watching this series.
順番に入ってくるのいいな😊

Translated audio during viewing. Separated by scene. They are watching episodes 1-3. Most of the time they are laughing.  Alan Oh My God! (looking at Daishun's kiss) Kazuto, hey..!  Alan That was it! (Seeing Dai talking about Shun) Shun, I'm gonna cry.  Kazuto, you're so cute! (Seeing Gensei's misunderstanding) Alan, you mean he's mistaken?  Shun, what? (Knowing that Ryota liked Shun) Kazuto, was that so? Alan, that's enough! 😂It was Shun! Gensei I'm embarrassed! (Seeing Gensei talking about Ryota while misunderstanding) Alan, you thought the letter was from Ryota too, didn't you? Gensei I thought the letter was too.  Alan, that's cute (seeing Shun playing the piano).  Dai Eh! Lies! (Hearing that Shun has become disillusioned with Dai) Shun, oh no... 😂 Dai I'm curious too! (Seeing that the presenter wants to watch episode 4)  After Talk. Alan Did you have any thoughts in that one that you thought, "She must have liked this girl"? Dye Like an arrow of love? Alan Yes, yes, yes! As an example, from Kazuto's point of view, something like 'Dai must like Shun'. Kazuto I thought Dai liked me, not Shun. Everyone laughs. Alan On the contrary, what about Shun? Shun I thought Dai was Kazuto. Yusaku I didn't realise it had progressed that far, I had no idea. Shun-kun and that time (in episodes 1-3)... Didn't he say, "I haven't done anything yet..."? Something like, "There's no one I'm interested in." Shun Yes, there wasn't. Yusaku Really? Shun But sometimes I think it's a bit nice because of my emotional ups and downs. (Pointing at Dai.) And it calms me down. But it becomes impossible. Alan Even though Shun's feelings seem to be swept away, the more time goes by, the more convinced he becomes. Kazuto Didn't he say, "I like Dai when we're alone"? Shun Yes, that's right. When he's with everyone else, he's always trying to fix things up. Alan And the most interesting thing is Gensei's misunderstanding 😂. Dai It's really interesting. Alan I think I like this scene the best. Kazuto You said 'because they end up liking each other'. Alan It's really funny.  Any final words? Ryota: I know the world will look at us in many different ways, good and bad, but what we spent at that time and in that place is irreplaceable, and it would be an exaggeration to say so, but it's an incredibly important thing, and I want to treasure it.  Shun (Dai) was single-mindedly devoted to me. I'm glad I could see that.  Dai I realised from an objective point of view that I had been doing my best to be close to Shun, but I reconfirmed that Shun was also very close to me, and that's why I said "thank you".  Ikuo: I think there are a lot of things that people are thinking about even if they don't speak, so I felt that a lot of emotions were moved in these three episodes.  Gensei I was most surprised that Ryota was interested in Shun. I didn't expect it. I thought they were just good friends, so I was surprised.  Tehon I'm happy that the days I spent with the Boyz in the Green room have become so wonderful, and I'm excited and thrilled that everyone around the world will be watching it.  Yusaku When I first bought the chicken breast, it was a bit of a shock to see that I was like this at this point 😂 like I was pretty pissed off at this point.  Kazuto I think I would have been worried if I was alone, so it was a relief to watch it with everyone else.  Alan It's a reality show between men, but it doesn't matter if you're a man, woman, age or gender, just a little bit more people saying 'we have something in common' or 'I understand this feeling' is very valuable. So I hope I can convey the message that we are the same people, not that we are gay, but that we like each other as men, and that it would be good if we could become a connection, that "I have these feelings too, and I know how you feel".  I used a translator, so there will be unnatural or incorrect parts, but you can assume that this is roughly what I am talking about.
Thank you so much Dai for choosing him ❤ I really really like this dating show. Becuz They met each other 😍 DaiShun
Please i can remember everything from the show, every single thing they said and the way all they showed here were their embarrassing moments of misunderstandings 😭😭😭😂😂.

ゲンセイさんかわいい🥺❣️尺足りないよ〜
Nggak ngerti ngomong ap but😊
DAI SO HANDSOME
鑑賞会でもキレイな涙のシーンを見せてくれるダイってやっぱすごい。
Though this was not the right moment for them to say whether they are a couple or not ( as some people are worried why Dai suddenly started to cry) But there were not even subtle hints from them of dating and they were kinda talking in the past tense a little bit too much. Idk whats going on honestly😂Im not saying they gotta make it announce publicly its their wish but ofc as a fan it wouldnt hurt to get a little update you know.
Minimal durasiiiii, ampun kemusuhannnnn bgt sama durasi
切実にフル尺お願いします。
Aku bahagia 🥰
Who jst watched without understanding anything but was smiling jst seeing them.i hope am not the only one screaming seeing shun n Dai sitting together n looking happy..

We need english subtitle 😢
한국어로 누가 번역 좀 해줘요… 알아 듣고싶다 제발…ㅋㅋ
The work around a I did to understand y’all. I watched on another device and used a translate app to translate the text on screen and another app to translate what they were saying. Took a bit but I get the gist now.   ABOUT SHUN AND DAI ONLY:  Shun basically is saying he thought Dai was into Kazuto. He also basically said it was nice to see that Dai was into him from the beginning. Dai basically said that when he watched objectively, that he he thought it was amazing that he was doing his best to be true to his heart and get close to Shun. He realized Shun was trying to be close to him too (at the viewing maybe?) He thanked the show for reaffirming this. Or he was thanking Shun for being close to him during the viewing. I’m not sure about that part.   It’s not quite clear from their words that they’re (Dai and Shun) still together, but it really does seem like they are and that the viewing helped reaffirm their feelings for each other. They sat next to each other and Dai moved up after the viewing, like maybe they weren’t supposed to reveal until a specific date in their contract whether they are together still or not. That would explain the seating before, during, and after viewing 1-3.   During the solo interview, Gensei basically said he was surprised that Ryota was interested in Shun because he thought they were just friends.   Someone who speaks Japanese can correct me if I’m wrong.  The surprise on everyone’s faces (especially Dai and Shun) when they saw their private kiss moment was in the trailer…
結局ゲンセイに手紙書いたの誰なんだい？

I am happy to see them all again. It's ok if Dai and Shun are not together. They gave us a happy ending in the show. I hope fans don't just follow them on Instagram just for them to be together. Guys love them if you like them individually. All of them have amazing personality. Arigato guys for introducing yourself to us. ❤
I was here smiling af but I understood nada😂😂😂
មើលសិន😢❤🇰🇭
O Daí chorando  Ele é muito romântico ♥️🇧🇷
本当にみんなみんな大好き 一生幸せでいて
Even though some municipalities recognize partnerships, Japan has not gotten to the point where same-sex marriage is as legal as in other counties.😢
I need more😭this is not enough😢
They are watching episodes 1 through 3 together. Usak said, "Oh, I was shocked to realize that the chicken problem started from when I first bought the chicken. I just stepped on a landmine." Lol
もうまじで一番好きなリアリティ😂😂
English subtitles please😅
If they laugh we laugh
結構配信観るまで知らないこととかあったと思うけど、9人みんながすごい楽しそうに笑いながらみてるのがいいなぁって思う 9人にとっては、ぜんぶ最高の想い出なんだよね…
Please eng sub
こういうの求めてた！！！！神やん
鑑賞始まった時、ダイシュンが驚いてるのはキスシーンかな😂💛💛💛
全部みんなの前でめくれちゃうのねwww
I need CC in English 😢😢😢 I wanna know what they're saying. International fan struggling.
I missed you all
Please could you put in active english translation for foreign fans. Thank you .🙏🙏💌
subtitle pleass for intern fans😢😢😢
全話フルで配信してほしいです😭余韻に浸れて最高です😭ウォッチパーティやってたのもみんなそれぞれ気持ちを知れるだろうから嬉しい😭
ゲイの高校生で、結構恋愛に消極的になっていた自分がいたんですが、ボーイフレンドに出会ってからもうずーーーーっとキュンキュンしてました笑 ことある事に一旦動画止めて騒いで、時に泣いて、心が温まって… 今まで恋愛リアリティーショーを見ようと思ったことなかったんですが、同じゲイだからっていう理由で見て、なんかもうそういうゲイとか関係なく人としての温かさみたいな所に凄く心を揺さぶられて本当に出会えて良かった作品です🫶🏻 本当に皆さんお幸せに！！！ありがとうございます！！
自分だったらぜっっったい自分の映像見れない。恥ずかしすぎて死ぬ！！！！！
2:21  Alan saying shun haircut is kawaii 😆and Dai literally jealous staring haha ( not gensei side eyeing Dai)
Gak ngerti anjayy, tapi tetap kutonton
ダイシュンらぶらぶでかわいすぎる😭😭

Loved that shun changed his seating position to come near to Dai. I Don't know but if they had broken up, they couldn’t be so comfortable with each other. While watching their kissing scene in bed, Dai almost fell upon Shun. I hope they are still together 😘😘

무슨뜻인지 모르지만 일단 봤습니다 해외연예인을 좋아하는 분들의 심정 알것같은..
同性同士の恋愛となるとロールモデルとなる存在が本当に少なく、当事者として、同性同士の恋愛は今まで異性愛と何か違うものではないかとつい不安に感じてしまうこともありましたが、番組を通して、恋や愛は性別関係なく素敵で普遍的なものであると改めて実感することができました。この番組が絶対に誰かの支えになったと思います。 波乱万丈ありましたが、笑ったり泣いたりとても楽しませていただきました。本当に面白かったです。 この番組の企画制作に携わってくださった方々に感謝申し上げます。本当にありがとうございました。
Meu pais Shundai
So  this reality show is not like they will be in future together
I miss you all ❤❤❤❤🇵🇭

Netflix JP is getting on my nerves. Please leave the cc on so at least there’s the auto translate if you’re not going to add English subtitles. Every video you post about them we kept asking for english sub. But there’s no progress on your end. At least, make it a little easy for us.
International fans deserve english subtitles.
