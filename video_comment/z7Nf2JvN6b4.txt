Its Mackacev who won the match yet he is talking about Dustin. What an ass 😢
I stopped on 2:54… I want to see highlights, not empty blabla! Mainstream media trashy
He lost motherfu*ker
I'm denying that Poirier is a respectful fighter, but they way he exaggerated is like he is the winner. Com'n guys, islam is the next Khabib
I’m just tryna see the fuckin finish
Dustin should have fought mcgregor , what was he thinking😂
Traing isn't the only factor.... lifestyle seems to be THE THING.
Great fight 🔥🔥
Mike will chew Connor up and spit him out!!!!
Edwards would school islam
Just another terrorist in the fighting industry.
Good job on ruining it for those that haven’t watched and also showing no footage, dislike
How did BC not make a completely stupid inappropriate sexual joke in a 9 minute interview? I rarely listen to him longer than 2 minutes before turning him off. Well done BC
Yes ❤❤❤ keep going Islam don’t be afraid to anyone
There is no history of a Muslim losing a fight! 💪😎🤲
Is this wrestling?
I see nothing but copium from the commentators. "Dustin inches close to victory" lol! In your dreams. Cope
Very close fight.
Don’t show me this channel
Spoiling the result in the title. Why
habib never bleeds blood
Still ran from Nate
He could easily hold on to the 155 title until he retires!
These muslim fighter are impossible
At 170 Mahchick is going to get demolished. 😂
Free Palestine🇵🇸
No one gives a fuck about your opinions. Just show the dang highlights
Khabib to Islam at training be like: "if you want to fight Dustin, you must won the fight against me"
Oh please, that fight wasn’t even close, these guys are talking like it was two and two going into the fifth
Kambing
Everyone should embrace Islam at this point. He is arguably the most complete and most skilled fighter in MMA history, and I have watched the last 3 decades of MMA amongst combat sports much longer overall.
This guy sounds dumb
Don’t make me ankle pick you
You don’t need to hold the belt to be a champion. Two champs in the ring fighting it out last night
Both of them , great fighter ❤
Circle khabib no counter cuyy😂🔥
To raise awareness of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) persecution of Falun Gong, Falun Gong practitioners arranged a screening of a film at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque in April 2023. Many audience members were struck by the CCP’s inhuman methods used against practitioners, brutally persecuted just for upholding their faith.   After the film screening, a practitioner told the audience about a new bill that was passed unanimously by the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill condemns organ harvesting in China, and imposes sanctions on those involved in the crime.   Amos, a retired engineer from Tel Aviv said, “This isn’t the first time I heard about Falun Gong. What is happening [in China] is really horrifying – harvesting organs from people!”    Amos, a retired engineer from Tel Aviv, said the film deepened his understanding of the extent of human rights violations in China.   “China is entirely networked with cameras. A person cannot take one step without being filmed. It is a dictatorship, just as in Orwell’s book ‘1984’,” he said. “I hope I can sleep tonight after watching this film. Because it’s one thing to learn about organ harvesting, and the persecution of millions, and another to see a film about a specific case. The movie illustrates the horror perpetrated by the CCP regime.”  Tehila, a retired senior employee in public health services, said, “I had heard about Falun Gong before, and the film gave a great sense of concreteness on the subject. The subject isn’t new, but the film intensifies the horrors. It is a very difficult film to watch, and it conveys the message of the atrocities of the Chinese communist regime and the oppression. The film conveys the unfathomable evil and cruelty.”
Im so ready to move past this phase of dagestani sombo wrestler bullshit. Theres never been a blander belt holder in the UFC id rather listen to Tito Ortiz' dumbass than spend another second watching or listening to the full blown fever dream vibe that comes with Islam andor khabib doing press or faceoffs. His fanbase is even more dispicible considering theres only TWO reasons someone claims "fan" for these dudes. And the massive and more common first reason is the classic "just pick whoever the best fighter is and act gay for them" or the other is his association with khabib period. Otherwise he offers absolutely no incentive to be a fan or even like him in fact its the opposite. He has no personality outside of just sharing mannerisms with khabib, no sense of humor, hes awkward, hes overconfident in himself and it entirely stems from WRESTLING skills. I mean all you gotta say is he is a wrestler... Enough said.. successful wrestlers are the biggest dipshit goofies in combat sports BY A MILE you are either a wrestler and are in a completely delusional state of mind or you are not a wrestler and recognize how gay it is. I dont care if he wrestles his way into triple champ it means nothing to me wheres your hands at. Its disgusting to watch and absoluteky seasoned veteran like dustin who has gone into full blown life and death striking exchanges who has said "fuck shooting, im about to SLEEP this motherfucker" the man has been 5 rounds deep covered in blood and pushed out picture perfect 15 piece combinations and landed every shot he is a true fighter it is disgusting to watch him fall short to this sombo bullshit and we all gotta pretend like islam is the better fighter when we ALL know and respect that he doesnt even hold a match to who and what Dustin is. I dont care if he wrestles and submits him 10 for 10, Islam is a pawn standing next to dustin. Islam has deadass never even put more than 2 consecutive strikes on an opponent through his entire run in the UFC. Same shit as khabib throws out a 1 and MAYBE a 2 with some wild ass form and then shoots for the ground VISIBLY desperate too lmfao. These goat fckers cant so much as spell combination let alone land so much as a straight and a jab. Just a bunch of swing once and hug the legs circus clown shit
Man yall are a b**ch showing the winner before the highlights hopefully yall go to hell.
russian too strong for us..🤦🤦🤦
Alhamdulillah
Islam is the pound 4 pound # 1 fighter in the world 🗺,  Jon Bones hides and doesn't want to fight & Dana holding on to Bones because thats his bread n butter. The Dagestanis been taking over. Thats facts** Islam beat all top fighters. Enough already
Could Islam look more retarded? Shit breeding holy fuck! Hahahaha don’t say shit about Alabama with all these chuds coming out of the same place as Islam looking even more retarded
Dustin so smart he was experiencing by khabib and he know khabib and islam is two similar stylesistic fight..Of course dustin learn a lot from khabib before and he levelise islam at same times..everybody know how and super good khabib is..he far from the best of LW fighter .. kudos to Dustin but he is the one whom experience the kind of finish by islam..they respect each other😊😊😊
Islam is not a fighter
man they are looking like best best frinds
Inshallah!!❤❤
Both are winners but that finishing moves are something else👍
I think his daughters reaction has a lot to do with him not fighting any longer
Only way Islam could of ever beat Dustin. He figured out he couldn't get the win on his feet. He knew how he had to win.
Wtf was the point of this video fuck cbs
Why nkt rematch it portier did enough
MASHALLAH I LOVE ISLAM FROM AFGHANISTAN 🇦🇫
First time I see Islam face got injured and blood. Dustin does give a good fight. Now left Khabib only who never injured on his face until he retired.
It wasnt close lol
Dustin had his moments but this fight was not close. I had Islam winning every round. I think the celebrations at the end were from a team that understood the difficult camp Islam had as it is believed Islam had a staph infection
Let him fight with khamzat
Let him fight with chamzat
No highlights???
Brian cambel is a breeze at mainstream platform..real facts here😊
2:23 bro they are not stoic, they are always emotional when any of their brother wins ❤🎉
Stfu and show some highlights
Poirer's ear at the end of the fight doesn't even look real
This guy will make you think Dustin was winning the whole fight. 1st Islam was out striking Dustin and obviously took Dustin down multiple times before putting Dustin to sleep. Don’t worry we all watched the fight and saw what happened. Now it’s the haters time to cope. Alhamdulilah Islam king👑🇵🇸
Diamond is the lightweight DC. The people’s champ.
The Muslim king Islam
DONT BE TRYING HARD TO BE CHAMPION POIRIER
Jones is overrated, he lost against Reyes, and draw against Gustaffsoon. Islam is the best P4P #1, only gay doubt t
gay gloves
Pussy ass submissions
It wasn't close. Islam won every round.
BC is TOO SKEWED for Dustin.. 😂

Poirier pernah juga terkena kuncian d'arce choke pas melawan Korean zombie
As soon as Poirier started coming out, you could tell his head wasn't in the game. I understand that guys love to amp themselves up with their music, but the look on his face and the things he was doing with the music just didn't seem right. Then the match started and you quickly saw how unprepared he was. He had heavy feet, never looked very balanced, and wasn't prepared enough to counter Islam's constant grappling. The man was floored multiple times and you could see how out-of-shape he was compared to Islam just by the sweat comparison alone... As if all of that isn't enough, there was once when Poirier was up against the wall talking to Joe Rogan and the others sitting by him.   Islam came to fight. Poirier came to show off.  I think Poirier's just over all of it. His head isn't in it anymore. Islam still had some hunger. Poirier wants to get out and settle down with his family. Can't blame him at all. Those guys live rough lives.
Russia wins bitch
Lol wtf? They they replaced the Russian flag with a UFC logo? 🤣🤣🤣
Allahuakbar brother may Allah protect you!! good job islam we all are proud of you ☝🏽
Islam , why u dont meet conor? I think u scare vs your team too
I don’t know how to true this is but I heard Islam had staph infection if he had staph he’d have to been taking antibiotics to combat that and Dustin last opponent had staph and said he felt slow what if Islam was on those antibiotics
Bunch of monkeys can’t fight. Just hold onto you like bear fuckers.
When Poirier came into apologize to islam, Poirier looked clearly on meth. I wonder what was going on.
Who Conor mg gregor
Why can't these announcers learn how to say the name of some of the most popular people in the sport? Shameful.
Why don't these guys in Khabibs camp ever really fight other guys that are wrestlers and grapplers? They always fight stand up boxers and those type of guys right? I feel like Matt Hughes and GSP etc the old school wrestling ground and pound guys would wreck them.  Chael Sonnen would whoop their ass right?
Nobody wants the terrorists to win
Islam is to big for that class !!  Ufc should weight people on fight night!!   Everyone knows the weight Islam cuts.  Congrats he beat a out of pride dustin
You don't show any highlights and just talk ...what a horrible channel trying to cover UFC
Very well said! Dustin is one of the the great no doubt
Ufc doesn't allow highlights is trash
Dustin is a class act
Islam.is the best
I honestly thought poirer was in a win and he went to round 5 and Islam looks beat up. Man poirer deserves that belt
Poirier is no baby. All who thought that don't know the sport...
Fighters don’t like this guy at all.
I picked Porier to win though I knew in my heart Islam would win. 😢
Islam got saved 😂😂 what a puss
Poirier is a WARRIOR
Americans are such racist bigoted POS... Islam soundly beat Dustin & all they had is praise for Dustin, as if he is the hero. Dumb f*cks
Not a bad showing but Islam didn't look at his best, he had trouble taking Dustin down, the striking was pretty much just boxing exchanges and it wasn't really dominant from either fighter, Islam's success were from his knees and elbows.  Since he's won the belt though I've not really seen him defend the belt dominantly yet. It's hard to see him beating Leon considering his size and striking advantage.   Maybe that's just the way Islam fights in general but I don't think he's unbeatable like khabib is, he's just very tough. But again, volk stole his aura in that first fight and I've not seen him dominate since.
i told y’all islam love humping  😂
Conner trash
Islam show everybody how good his striking and dustin punch is nothing 😂😂😂😂😂
Dustin Really said "I'll make you bleed"
If Islam was as smart as Khabib, Dustin would have finished round two
3 submissions, the rest decisions im sorry but this was a bad event. I'm getting tired of not seeing anything good, yes ground game is important but when nothing happens on the feet it just looks like BJJ fight and i would rather watch slap fighting over wrestling sorry not sorry.
Allahuakbar.. Islam.. Indonesian love u🎉❤👍
Poirier is a true ambassador to the UFC sport .... nothing compared to Connor  who disgraced the UFC sport with vile acts of violence outside the ring...
Thumbs down cause no video of any highlights
Islam ❤❤❤❤
Its all about Porier? Islam won. He's almost flawless. Yeah it was a tough fight. Dustin is no scrub. But the fact that he won again, says everything. This guy is incredible. Taking nothing from Dustin. But the Dagastan crew is unstoppable. I should've put money on Islam. Smh.
Congrats Champs Islam🔥🎉🏆, Free Palestine🇵🇸
Islam's best reply to his never ending Haters ❤
BROOO, I Fell asleep😢😢😢
Boooo Booooo
ITS FACT DC NEVER WANTS ANOTHER BLACK MAN TO PROSPER. HE DOESNT EVEN LOOK OUT FOR HIS PEOPLE IN HIS OWN TOWN. NEVER ONCE DID DC INVITE DUSTIN TO AKA. THE WRESTLING WOULD OF HELPED HIM BUT DC NEVER WANTS SOMEBODY FROM HIS OWN SKIN COLOR, LET ALONE SOMEBODY FROM HIS OWN CITY TO OUT SHINE HIM.
Before the fight I saw comments saying that dustin will get an easy KO on Islam. After the fight I see people complaining on how islam wasn't dominant enough.
Money in the bank 😂😂😂😂, I knew it was gonna be a submission
that is how Russian beat United state..
Why nobody showing us the submission part 😂
Thanks for spoiling it
Pertarungan ini menjelazkan bahwa level makacev jauh dibawah habib
Rematch
Everything is so easy and off talking when you sitting youtube broadcast  when time khabib said ufc player is not normal people i feel islam dustin go back to your home and never play in the ufc play football or pasketball
AND still P4p Champion islam ❤❤❤
Who give this man black belt? We have to check this brother
That ankle twist was insane. Dustin was so good in defending those holds but man how do you see something like that coming in R5?
Wow what a fight Islam 🎉 congratulations bro ☝️
Islam 🙏
Khabib and his team are always extra happy for islams wins
its was a hell of performance by both.they went toe to toe but that show you how much khabib was advanced..
That has to be the best Ankle Pick I’ve ever seen
Dustin let them know Russian dudes human
System just came up short
