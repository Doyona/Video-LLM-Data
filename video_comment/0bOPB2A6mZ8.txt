My dad would love to be there but he was so excited to join my eldest getting a signed Bristol city hat on the pitch a few years ago for her book epilepsy book for kids which raises money for epilepsy charities and fundraising for young carers charity too.
0:01   What is the no one what’s to date her AYO?
I remember when I saw you raced tolu koula at 100m u came 2nd
You live off others - you offer nothing yourself
From Wembley to strictly
16:58 its so cute how they came to watch and was so excited for him 😢
13:54 This was so crazy manifestation or something. Congratulations George.💯
12:25 This was so lovely, George dedicating a segment knowing the importance of this moment and how wholesome it was.
Joey Barton mention 😂😂
I'm pretty sure you can thank Jeremy Clarkson for the "an" vocabulary 😄
Why does George have the best clip edit for Josh’s goal I’ve seen anywhere?
I've got one question for the men of the UK- why don't any of you have hair on the sides of your head? Why does every hair style for  British men include shaved sides? So many handsome guys on the pitch with absolutely boot nasty haircuts.
George needs to be in the next Bridgerton .... just saying
Elite song choices from you man.
I haven't seen your sports content before only the reaction stuff, but I was SO surprised when you came on the pitch and you were that atheltic. I don't know how to phrase this without making it seem like an insult, but you were SO much better than I thought you'd be haha. Incredible mate. Congrats.
Of course George uses the an/a joke like Jeremy Clarkson.
Hockey lad tries a Wembley
Haven't heard the wembley cup song in years
can we take a moment to just appreciate the pure masterpiece of  a soundtrack this video has? pure cinema!!!!!!
That goal is so fucking funny i cant omg😭😭😭😭😭
🐐
I know it's unlikely you'll see this, but you do deserve to be in the charity match, you belong there just as much as everyone else and after watching this I feel really proud of you!  - Louise x
honestly with ur vibe and energy not alone with the music in the sorts of the middle with it, id do some drugs to ur videos LOLOL
you know, i need a fire video with you and simon asap.
A goals a goal. Haaland and jude would hit 3 celebrations
I think you're my favourite sidemen guest. I'd like to see you and Lannan interact more
Waiting for him to hint who won inside
You are one of the real ones all the love bro keep shining
So proud of you! also great dj snake reference 🫡
fiiiyyaaa 🔥🔥💚
5:36  No way we’ve got George Clarke aura farming before GTA 6 😭🙏
You deserve every opportunity humble king! Try not be surprised next time, youre awesome <3
Aggressive industry plant is nuts!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
you are honestly the handsome funniest guy 😂❤ love you
i admit my eyes leaked at the end😪
So proud of you Georgie ❤
You kept saying you don’t belong there George but you do. Your so good at what you do and you very modest x well done for the shit goal 😂
I love you George Clarkey
Real question I'm new to youre chanel are you and Chris MD brothers ?
The most wholesome video ever❤ u deserve this moment clarke
Bro you also stopped his goal with handball, there no giving.
george well done you played so well and if only u could know how proud i was of you for scoring bless you you are the cutest
Anyone notice in the dressing room it said on the back of a shirt freezy 71
Nah the DJ Snake edit hit hard 😭
Jason seems like a sweet lad
What is common between Halaand and George? They both score tap ins
You kept saying in the video you don’t know how you’re the one getting this amazing opportunity, well it’s because your deserve every inch of love and support you’re getting out there, just one of those absolutely genuine people. You did amazing💗
Not even the magic school bus could have taken you to the places you’ve gone.
Um Name Dropping, U Glazin Right now buddy.and U did what @ Wembley?
i promised to build a new world... for us two.....
An Jeremy clarkson
This legit couldn’t have happened to a better person. He’s one of us
Please do a video of you,Bach,Arthur hill and Arthur tv reacting to edits of eachother 🙏🙏
George isnt an imposter he was always there love u mate
i wish you knew how much you actually do deserve every bit of this 🫶🏻
the tearing up and getting emotional at the end ohhh i’m not strong enough for this 🥹 so insanely proud of you george, you’re an amazing person 🤍
INSIDE SEASON 2 WITH GEORGE?????!!!!
this is so beautiful
George you clearly didn’t hear the roar when you got subbed on, you don’t understand how much people love you!  Can’t wait to see you on inside
I remember commenting on one of his tiktok live streams ‘you should do a collab with Jack Joseph’ - to which he said I don’t see that happening any time soon. Look at him now. Got my lonely ass smiling through the whole vid. Well done squire , an true achievement (understatement of the year)
14:23 Clarkey you're actually a Gem of a man 🤩 how you do all your jokes, the personality you carry,it's so amazing.. Everybody loves you.. I saw you in  faith's video, ..i saw you on the sidemen, chris's videos .. I'm genuinely saying that you're a bit of a fresh air in the youtube scene.. you're my top 2nd after stephin tries (Don't take it person 😅) .. All the very best clarkey boy for the future Events 🫂♥
FLUME❤❤❤
honestly ur very relatable like the last few mins of the video rlly struck home for me keep up the good work mate
ive heard kiss from a rose a weird amount recently
great vid amazing editing. keep it going 👍
why am I SOBBING. george u deserve every good thing coming ur way, inside is gonna be YOURS
Honestly I wanted the training kit more than the actual kit. It looked slick af. Maybe because its on a model xoxo
ooooooooooo
sucha old school youtube vibe to this one :)
It’s really beautiful that in the midst of the coolest event, you were able to take the time 6:14 to roast Arthur
so proud of you
George, a genuine person like you deserves it all and more. Congratulation's
yeahhh
' middle' being the song you put over your goal is genuinely cinematic
Still shocked that you met THE JME
First sidemen AI industry plant gains consciousness of his life
3:59 are george and jason going to be on inside s2
George, ginge and Simon came to my school AND I MISSED IT?
Well done George!!
does anyone have reactions of both teams from the penalty shootout? i have seem a couple of small clips from certain youtubers but not much. that's what i want to see!!!
so deserved
Maybe the best edit sequence @12:15
Legend
loveliest guy, deserves every ounce of this ❤
The “an” vocal stim could very much be from top gear. Jeremy Clarkson used to say it a lot and I realised I’ve accidentally picked up on it too lol.
proud of u king
craziest prison break reference i’ve seen recently 2:42
Congrats 🙏
i want to be in a charity match so bad man it looks so surreal, give me a year and maybe i’ll be known 😂
Such an authentic guy and video. Well deserved Clarkey! 🎉
seeing how happy and excited bach and arthur were for you at the end shows they're true friends man
You honestly give me the same comfort as watching Jenna Marbles idk why
So proud of you king, we all knew you could do it🩷🩷
You’re so deserving of this George!!!
15:04 As long as don't have to listen to anymore fucking Coldplay then I'm all good
Clarkey has to go on goat wellers podcast wafflin as bach and arthur already have. He can talk about his generational dap ups with theo baker.
15:15 ChrisMD was so proud of him
Why am I crying?
you deserved every minute of it!!!
This was actually quite a humble video.   Loved it.
George, you should know better than to wear jeans while eating pasta. Everybody knows that you wear stretchy pants.
20:20 YOU GUYS????? GEORGE IS IMMEDIATELY MY FAVE AAAAAA
WHAT???? GEORGE ON INSIDE S2????? YEEEEEEAAAH!!!!
randy cameo is insane
"not entirely deserved"... mate you were the most deserving of anyone to play in that game, maybe Sketch and the Fellas managing were the only ones just as deserving. just a shame Bach and Arthur couldnt make it when Randolph and Callux did...
So happy for you man
those are some GREAT friends you hv there Clarkey 16:57
playing middle for your goal was so funny icl😂
THIS IS TOO CRINGE. JUST ENJOY IT
🙃 'I meant the drink'  hahah🤣
You belong.
How can someone be this good looking?
I’ve got a feeling you and Jason are gonna be funny on inside 😂😂
Yippee
Cant tell you my joy upon seeing Arthur and Bach in the crowd. YOU DESERVE EVERY SUCCESS GEORGE!!!!!
Deserve to be there more than Speed lol
Pretty insane dude. You’re officially a “personality”
Bagwell vibes, quality reference 😂😂😂 2:42  Happy for you George, living the dream!
This video confirms Clarkey's aura level allowed the goal to be scored
This was editing perfection
Pretty privilege going insane with this one (he is sound though)
‘An’ whole pasta was a clarkson thing on top gear i believe
Imagine being the funniest person in almost every collab you do and still having imposter syndrome, wake up Georgie boy you're a youtuber
nonchalant goal scorer final boss
That training montage goes hard, you know the one we're you defiantly score *every goal
17:11 didn’t fancy quoting Joey Barton there then😂😂
What an achievement! Bless ya❤
I wanted to see more of max in this video. George don’t forget your very large gay support as you get more famous
The ending message is so sweet. It's truly lovely seeing all the people involved in the charity match, so grateful and having such fun. Your increase in subscribers recently is impressive (mind you, I only subscribed at the start of the year), I'm excited to see how well you do once Inside comes out. Doubt, you'll actually see all of the comments, but regardless. The very best to you,  keep on keeping on n thriving ✨️  your humour and genuine appreciation for your opportunities is wonderful to see. 👍🏼
I love how humble you are despite everything. You really shot in to this world so quickly but you deserve it all x
From one George to another, big D energy.
It was a great match!!!+ Absolutely lovely seeing everyone so happy n proud to be there. The celebrations were brilliant, especially seeing everyone supporting their friends. Bravo to you all 👏🏼✨️
We made the right person YouTube famous <3
From first time seeing him on the chrismd channel , being totally relatable on the self depricating humor and being totally unrelatable on good looks (How does it feel to be the most handsome man in a 90000+ wembly ground).Proud of you man.Big ups🎉
proper poachers goal - the only one on the move, instincts that
Oh my god!!!!! George for inside season 2!!!
The moment when Clarkey’s name came up on that big screen announcing to 90k people he was the one that scored, all I can say is…. WOW the noise that erupted ❤
20:21 ok love this 😂
Was 8:18 filmed by chrismd
No George you absolutely did deserve playing and scoring at wembley! You did amazing! Very happy for you🤭
Didn’t think I was gonna cry at the end🥺🥺oh georgeyyyy you deserve the best can’t wait to see you in InSide❤❤❤
U deserve it all man, imo ur one of the goats
Instant tears when I saw your mums shirt 😭 She so cute and obviously so proud 💕
2:42 the prison break reference lmao
Swear this guy used to be funny
this was incredible so proud !!!
It was a tap in from about a yard out... Calm down George 😂😂😂
You are adorable! I love watching the behind-the-scenes, vlog style videos! Your narration and music is top notch! Love ya!!!
so happy for you bro. feels like you deserve everything coming your way right now. quickly becoming a legend
4:49 this is so real 😂❤
Seeing George so happy actually makes me so happy (kinda cringe Ik)
i was at the game. the noise everyone, including me and my friends, made when george came on and more importantly scored, was actually immense. it was such a phenomenal experience and full of incredible moments. josh, speed AND george scoring, the pen shootout, the yellow card situation, everything. one of the most memorable, fun days of my life.
12:14 Omggg he looks like Mr beast kinda
it's deserved man, well bloody done
You're a chill and funny guy and that's enough reason for us to support you and for you to deserve all this! Looking forward to a whole year of CLARKEEEEY!
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!!
thanks Will for getting that beautiful angle🥰
7:48 🤣🤣🤣
Top Job Chap 🤘
Recently started watching you and your friends. Just be like that don't change. You all are just perfect.
13:57 You manifested it😭😭❤️
I’m glad someone mention the kia clip and Arthur and Bach were too cute!!
ive been watching georges content since when he was doing the garage beep series and im so proud of all of these opportunities that he’s having, like playing at wembley?!?!! and i can’t wait to watch him on netflix in 3 days 😭
14:23 Clarkey you're actually a Gem of a man 🤩 how you do all your jokes, the personality you carry,it's so amazing.. Everybody loves you.. I saw you in  faith's video, ..i saw you on the sidemen, chris's videos .. I'm genuinely saying that you're a bit of a fresh air in the youtube scene.. you're my top 2nd after stephin tries (Don't take it person 😅) .. All the very best clarkey boy for the future Events 🫂♥️
shut up! you deserved to be on that field and i will always stand by that 😊
i had the recheck what i’m watching because the sudden edit???
Actually happy you scored.. next year from open play outside the box.. 17:49
That yank Jason is legit funny though 😂
i stood up and applauded
4:47 Like Clarkson, like Clarkey.
the ending of this vid is exactly why you deserve what’s happening and more :)
I think the beep in the garage needs a shoutout too 😂
shit goal or not, our George Clarkey scored at f*cking Wembley! you deserved that huge pop when you first came on and I'm very glad you got a goal. all of you are such good examples of why the UK YouTube scene thrives the way it does
Clarke to 10 mil
I bet seeing 90k people sitting in a stadium really puts it into perspective just how much that is. When we look at numbers of views, some people will be like 90k ain't a lot, but then you see it in this light and it stuns you. Cheers to you George!
gotta love the joey barton shout out
Congrats so much george. It will maybe be like 6 months and actually realise wtf i did that!
You are such a amazing human being! Keep doing what you are doing man, really appreciate you!
We love a grateful king.
Looking forward to the Jason stream 😉
I’m so excited to see you in season 2 of Inside! Being on Netflix is actually crazy
A video with you and the tism girl would bang... find taylor and film a video
insane editing and music taste unmatched as always...
im fully crying over how much i love this man
Femball
Why is this video actually so cute
“I meant the drink”
You deserve to be there clarkey.. you added so much spice to that event .. good luck for more charity matches in the future.
Sound track went crazy
I woke up at 6am just to watch you play! It was so worth it to see you get a goal! You have been making everyone so proud ❤
Class video
The mcu esque ending 🤣🤣
Loved the fail montage, cracked me up! On another note, you need to give yourself more credit, you deserve all of this! Theres a reason everyone wants you around and I feel like this will be your biggest year yet 🤍
we definitely made the right person famous 🥹
What a genuinely amazing video. So well put together. Best coverage of the match. Love to you george
Unreal song choices throughout the video.
George Clarke is the best guy. I wish he was my friend.
The part about Bach Arthur and Arthur not playing was so funny
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
ahhh omg you are the best and you totally deserve this and all of your achievements!! thank you for making us all laugh and be so happy while watching your videos ❤❤
Proud of you, man,
SPENCER FC FOR THE WEMBLEY CUP
I've said this on a few of these reaction videos from you guys....The genuine appreciation all of you showed for being part of this has been so refreshing and a joy to watch.  You are right.  You are just a bunch of silly boys doing silly stuff and all of that resulted in an event like this, where even if a cent wasn't raised it was just wholesome and fun and uniting.  To add 5 million dollars to charity on top of it..... Congrats..... keep being humble keep being appreciative and keep enjoying the ride!
Funny guy!
You belong there, man!
I KNEW that song was coming
You deserved it so much 🩶
I have teared up watching this, both at the josh pen and when  you scored the Puskas and Martha award nominee. Fucking legend, fucking sexy legend should I say. Love you George, keep up the great work!
"Or in the crowd..." cut to ArthurTV and Bach, that was so funny
the josh goal is the most emotional editing ive ever seen for the goal
genuinely feel such an unusually strong sense of pride for a man I don’t know lol. crazy how far you’ve come so fast. got so emotional at the end of this video. well done george ❤
The music, The edits, This video is so wholesome!!!!
W JASON ❤
Georgeous Clarkey
When im in an imposter syndrome competition and my opponent is George 😂😂
i dont think ur meant be in goal
Yo, why does George have the best edit of the Zerkaa's goal? That was beautiful. Congrats on everything, and more to come, esp with you being in Inside 2. You're a netflix star. Wild.
Cant wait for insdie jason and George carry this show for me plzz
beautiful
The Josh scoring edit is actually so 🔥🔥🔥
king you deserve ALL of this and more, keep slaying
smile the whole video, so joyful and wholesome
Be honest: did you shed a few tears at some point during all this?
WITH YOUU IN THE MIDDLE
The celebration with Chris and George was the best celebration
made the right person famous
This transition was smooth asf 16:04
seeing you score in person was so special, forever proud of you George. I know you don’t believe this but you do truly deserve every single bit of this crazy life that you are experiencing at the moment ❤
I have never been more atracted to another man( i am a man and George confuses me)
george well done you played so well and if only u could know how proud i was of you for scoring bless you you are the cutest
Nah using the Wembley Cup song from Spencer is a class move George
15:04 defenders touch with a forwards positioning
Ginge got speed his first goal lol. You just delayed it....
From the beep in the garage and yellow reduced stickers, to playing AND scoring in front of a sold out Wembley. Couldn’t be prouder of you George🥲💜
Very proud of all you’ve done George will in mate
im a recent subscriber and have only JUST started watching ur vids since the sidemen match BUT i can already tell ur funny as fuck and whatever u dont think u deserve, u do. also may i say youre very very handsome and charming (5'4 23 year old british woman btw) LOL ok jokes aside, if u believe the impostor syndrome will go, it'll go :)
We made the rest the right guy famous ladies and gentlemen
You made me remember how much of a banger Kiss from a rose is tbh
16:57 was so wholesome bless them
Using DJ Snake is absolutely iconic LETS GO!
What do you mean you don't deserve it? Did you hear the crowd mate ❤❤
Iconic and well deserved 👏👏
I thought Stephen was kidding about the fanbase, but i just saw the comments 😂
it's so so so deserved george!!!!!!! <3
Oh how i love you george clarkey proud of youu❤
seeing jason banter with all the brits MAKES ME SO HAPPY
so lucky to be a small speck in the background🥰🥰 (you best believe we went crazy when you scored😼)
6:10 , your not the only one mourning the absence of Arthur, bach and Arthur
Everytime i hear that goddamn song omg
George I’m literally crying 😭😭 we are all so proud of you!!!!
0:54 holy shit I’m so glad you put this chant in. Every time I hear “we’re going all the way” that’s all I sing back to myself 😂😂
so proud of you george we all love ya 💓💓
16491st
0:15 i honestly thought he was gonna say “or simply just being bald” and pan to Theo 🤣🤣
Imposter syndrome or not, you're a chill guy who people like to be around which is why (as you put it) people like the Sidemen have you in their videos so much. Just keep being yourself bud and you'll never be an imposter.
Licensed music ?! Our boy is slaying
BEST VIDEO ITW. ily
nah this is too wholesome
I know you said you feel like you don’t deserve it. But I think you’re one of the most genuine people on YouTube. You have helped so many people with your videos. We’re all so proud of you!!🫶🏻🩷
INSIDE SEASON 2!??!?!?😮😮
the edit for your goal was perfect 🙏🙏
you do deserve to be on that pitch, i don’t why you think you don’t :/   it wasn’t a tappy little hit, it wasn’t anybody else’s goal, it was yours 🥹<3
genuinely was in tears watching this, it’s been so awesome to watch you go from just some silly guy taking a shot a minute in his room to an equally silly guy taking shots at wembley. proud of u man 🙌🩷
Assuming Chris hasn’t stopped talking about the win ?
The crowd reaction for your sub was insane 👌
17:49 your mum with the shirt of your surnames on the back and picture of you both on the front 💯 cute little moment there clarkey💯👌🏾❤️👏🏾
So happy for you George! The charity match was amazing!
Yes Clarkey you legend
hearing you say you dont feel like you deserve to be there is insane. so, so proud of you, you’re such a funny and amazing person george, do not forget that!! so happy you enjoyed your day, you DID deserve it! 💓💓
I’m to scared to be this early
oh george, i'm so very happy for you!! this whole video has got me crying tears of joy and of pride, and i really wish i could've been there to watch, but i'm so proud of you, you absolutely deserve this, even if you don't realise that <3
SO SO PROUD
scored at Wembley and now ur on to be a netflix star what da hell
George you should be so proud of yourself! You deserve all of this! ❤❤
FIFA 18 background music goes hard
You’re a good guy George and that’s why people like you and root for your success! You earned it!
the middle edit might have been one of the coolest things i’ve ever watched
You killed it m8 when I realised it was you playing I was genuinely happy for you Deserved!
one of the best edited ones ive seen
breaks my heart how u dont think u deserve this. you're there for a reason and were all so proud of u :)
The way I tried not to cry in front of my sister at the end of the video 😭
we made the right guy famous!
The fact that they are playing at Wembley and looking like professionals while we in Italy had Partita del Cuore with singers playing against politicians, random musical moments, and even more random testimonials mid-match is honestly hilarious
prison break reference! best crossover x
Your videos never fail to make me laugh 😊
Most self deprecating full legend
Had my headphones whilst getting something from the fridge at 15:42 and genuinely thought that was a woman lmao
'Life's getting crazy soon'   Why is that George Clarky, what else is happening soon? I need to know because I spend all my time INSIDE.
we love you George! we are all proud
imposter syndrome final boss, SO deserved!!
Such an incredibly humble man. You really don’t know the impact you have on people. You do deserve everything you have, and thank you for all you do
Giving speed goal is more big moment than your goal 🤣
Well done George 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 You on chrismd's and the sidemen vídeos is allawys a great adition🤞🏻
Imagine being on a pitch with 21 other men and being the most handsome of them all
yo
So happy for you George 🥳
see u on inside!
ughh he’s so fine 😭
So proud of u 🔥🔥🔥
Love this for you!♥️
One of the few influencers who deserves experiences like this! God bless you even more🫶🏽🫶🏽
Jason and George is the new best duo of the year
haven't watched inside season 1 and I'm getting excited for season 2 just because of George 😂
So happy for you George! This vlog just oozes joy, hopefully you get many more of these moments because you seem the most kind, genuine guy ❤
So proud ❤️
Honestly most deserving person for all of this to happen to! We love you George❤
So happy for you George, you deserve it so much! ❤

I don’t think I’ve been prouder of anyone ever xxx
I promise to build a new world for us two, With you in the middle!!!!
🎶 I PROMISE TO BUILD A NEW WORLD 🎶 P.s you more than deserve it George congrats ❤
You deserve being on that pitch as kuch as the others do 😊😊
George is such a diva bro
GEORGE!! so deserved, you were great. CONGRATS!
6:23 Arthur hill rage would have been hilarious
well i've just spent 20 minutes sobbing, so proud of you clarkey! x
I will always love your humour in videos ❤ just saying i was here  before you become world superfamous
great now i'm crying, again. It was insane seeing your goal, so proud of how far you've come x.
So so proud of you!!!
I PROMISE TO BUILD A NEW WORLDDDDD
Don't sell yourself short, you absolutely did deserve your place on that field!🙌
Never been prouder of anyone 🫶🏻
cant wait for inside
Perfect song choice for the goal 😮‍💨 14:04
one of the most deserving people 🫶🏼
I hadn’t noticed before Freezy mentioned it but you have developed a number of odd verbal tics. 😂 Also, very well done. This is all very much deserved - you wouldn’t have gotten this far if the people who believed in you (Chris, the Sidemen etc) didn’t know your worth. You have been the best addition to UK YouTube in many years. Also you got one of the biggest cheers when you came on out of anyone. That’s how loved you are. And the fact that players from both teams were gassed for you scoring as well.
Well done George!!!
V wholesome
Ahaha what a title! An iconic video for an iconic match!
chris md was absolutely gorgeous the whole game 🙏🙏
16:57 , this moment was so cute, i love arthur and bach so much
Soooo proud ❤
Can’t believe I’m in a George Clarkey video! (Top level, behind the screen, invisible to the naked eye)
joe and George I duo I never knew I needed 😂 absolutely love
George On Inside Season 2, Let’s Fookin Go!!! ❤️‍🔥👑🐐

The top off to the goal was George absolutely throwing himself at the net 😂
i love u georgie
yayaya
I remember watching george’s TikTok’s after covid then seeing where he is now honestly is so well deserved, we love you George!! ❤❤ ❤
Hi George
From looking for a beep to playing at wembley in front 90k people irl and 2.7m online. We're so proud of you Clarke!!
it's so wholesome watching you achieve your literal childhood dreams, so so proud!!
so proud you played absolutely amazing 🫶🏻
thought i cud say first comment, daamn george is gone
Yeah you did
the title implies that you scoring in front of 90,000 people at wembley stadium comes second to your unsatisfactory defensive performance
Can’t lie I only watched the game for u and Chris and I’m so glad I did well done bro
<3
george clarkey upload day is my favourite kind of day !
