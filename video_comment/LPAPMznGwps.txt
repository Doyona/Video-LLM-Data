Time to build out the MB Mike, I want to see that beating up the Block
it also could be the oil cooler....
I love these fn cars!!!!!!!❤
That tow truck driver is rough as 🤦‍♂️ glad that's not my car, I would be going mental.
Buy Josh Laurent motor for the amg gt
A high compression and high revving NA LS with equal length headers would be gangster in that
Guess mercedes never really got rid of the biodegradable, delicious to rodents wiring harnesses and plastics. lol.
Supercool Ride ⚡️
Marc is doing better every episode.  Sean has really grown on me.. I see myself in him...I'm a quite person.
Put a full new asphalt
DDE needs more German cars
To be honest, give that Mercedes some symphony. Give it a V12. There's plenty around and make sure the pipes  are Ti.
Note to self, never buy a exotic, supercar or luxury/classic without a storage lift
Who's Maddie?
m5 competition engine and u good
Soap and water would have gone a long way getting it off the flatbed
Wow that tow truck driver does NOT know what he’s doing. You need to come to Vermont or fly me out there to show you how a real tow truck operator does it. And the only thing that touches the floor or the Ben of the truck are its tires
a W16 will look good in that engine bay😁😇
When all else fails LS swap it and slap twin turbos on it lol
Sounded like Trump Jr lol
26:23 stfu mark your dumb and your not Mike
B58 AMG GTS
Fuck man an SMX
I watched this channel only when Mike on just him and tim!!! Dave and Damon are a turn off been 🤷‍♂️
Ls swap the car
I would put a Coyote with dual turbo's and a 6 speed.
s54 would go hard
Put an LSX in it. Big. Cheap. Power.
Couldn’t you guys take the engine apart and build it?
As a professional tow truck flatbed operator I can say what he doing with the shake method he is not doing correct he should have skates under rear tires cuz he has potential to ruin the rear end and axles
You think it´s Cheap... until you know the Price of the Engine. It´s about 60K Euros or 65K Dollar just the Basic without anything on it
Hope they build a badass Merc
Tell the towtruck driver to use soap and water to let the car slide off easier 🤦‍♂️
I’m voting for a few DDE GOLF CARTS For the premises 😮😅😂
Little bit of dish soap would have made this off load a million times easier and less cringe worthy
That flatbed driver gave no fucks about that AMG😂😂😂
Now that’s a car 😉
0M606!
Please do a build series on this GT, I’m sure the views and ads would pay for its repairs and then some 🤙🏼
Press the ! Button on that pack to put it in a temporary override jumpstart mode
Just put a 20b
Too be quite honest.  You should throw a b58 in it and build it.  Yall would gain a ton of followers and love and hate reviews, that's just what comes with custom builds.
LT 4 super charged swap
The look in Mikes eye when Sean questions the n54 fitment
16:42 Did you look that all up on Engine Patrol?
I’m sorry but I’m done with you guys every video is the same and they are very boring now, this is not the DDE when I first watched it’s just click baits and ppl talking about a engine or somthing so boring 😂
Title: I BOUGHT AN AMG GT FOR $2300 and over paid!!!!
Aston v12 engine would be nice in that Mercedes
I just refurbished 4 of these turned one into a black edition tribute, key goes in the center console lol
Probably should of used skates when shaking that thing off
M120  v12 swap with  pajak_carbonerre body kit 👌
You need a parts car for the parts car. Literally.
You can insert the key in the centre console
I think a twin turbo LS would look great in that car.
Put a c63 engine in there cheaper
Buy Mike a Super Car, no click bait
You guys are spoiling us with content. I wasn´t a full follower before but I am know!
How old is the fuel in it?
Built N63tu swap 😂
Where did the new camera guy go?
Mike pls u have no idea we would love to see u build the Mercedes it would be sick
Key fob manual crank is in the center console
One of those offices is going to be Mike's new apartment... 🤣
If he had done it before he would have been smart enough to WD40 the bed before he started and it would have slid right off 😂😂
Yeah do a build on this one for mike, i think all involved in DDE should be driving super cars. The rally vids would be awesome with all the crew too
Please put a 6.2 v8 in it and a gt3 bodykit so u have a road legal 6.2 amg gt gt3 !!! That would be mental
PLIS, IS THERE ANY CHANCES TO GET A V8 FROM THE M3 E46 GTR???, THE V8 4.0 RACE ENGINE???? OOOOOF🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🤯🤯🤯
If anything store it at DDE = get to it when you can = put a vett motor in it = the car itself is fine
Built M57
Writing this mid video but whatever MB dealer saw this charged $1300 and didn’t put a new battery in the with almost 100 electronic modules are flat out stupid (MB tech myself)
Did someone say ford 7.3ci?
I hate cars 🤢🤮 good morning
How many mistakes you make from beginning that is not truth... 😮😮😮😮 Mike are you ok??
Yes you do Mike grab that thing and put an LS in it
LS swap race car. 😂😂. Willing to buy it if DDE passes on it.
all them spitting ideas off each other for this car gets me excited of what this car can really be 🤣🤣🤣
Viper V10 swap! Something different and it should fit in the bay.
Call Alex of Legit street cars....he is a Mercedes Tech
You need Legit street cars to diagnose the merc
Put a proper v8 in it..LS swap!!!!!
I hope you fix it not like the old s55 and ran over it with the hummer🇦🇺👍
Putt 2JZ GTE in Mercedes and make 1000hp with that motor.
That guys is a hack.  Hate to know how they got it on there
stopped watching years ago as the videos were dropping quality unfortunatly, was hoping to come back to see familar faces atleast, video quality hasnt gone up but no familiar faces which was a shame. maybe next time xD
Mike   Check Out Pacific Motors.  They Have Virtually A Brand New 4.0L Long Block Out Of A 21/22’ S580. - $15K  It Would Be A Perfect Starting Point.  You Could Probably Work Some Advertising Discount/Freebie Deal..??  It’s Worth A Look/Effort.  Good Luck!
Block car budddddddddd
Hey all, I'd like to retract my "Hellcat swap it" statement. As I was building Hondas all night I had time to custom build this Mercedes in my head. You may like it, you may not. It's what I would do if it was my car and I had a big budget.  Body -Meguiars marine oxidation remover on all the lenses, should almost look new with a high speed buffer -wrap the entire car in flat black carbon fibre -flat black DDE graphics (ghosted) -exposed high gloss carbon fibre wide body kit and GT wing -deep dish 12" wide rear rims ( 5 spoke) - deep dish 10" wide front rims( 5 spoke Both in gold chrome but definitely do not stance the car! -Bc coil overs -make it a targa top #becauseracecar #becausecalifornia  Drive train This will definitely either be a love it or hate it  -mustang 5.0L voodoo flat plane crank v8 N/A motor. Here's why... -forged crank, micro polished - Lazer line hone the block - stud and girdle the bottom end -hone all 8 cylinders till they are identical bores -acid dip and xray the block for stress cracks after machining -matched set of forged pistons and rings -titanium H-beam connecting rods -balance the rotating assembly -titanium head studs -ported heads -custom ground high rpm cams  -full titanium valvetrain Here's where I got really creative!! -180 degree equal length long tube titanium headers 8 to 1 -4" titanium straight pipe I'm 100% certain that engine will stay together well above 10,000 rpm -dynotune for max performance, no flame tube, no popcorn fart tune, no burble tune. Just tuned to get every last hp available. It may not make huge amounts of power, but I guarantee it's the only AMG turning over 10k on the 405! Especially with that 1 off 180 degree header setup. Very unique sound -6 speed sequential gearbox  Thoughts?
last time my coolant ball was empty i cracked the head in my mk4 gli
That doesn't make it go fast 🤣🤣 Good advice sometimes you have to be laugh at your problems. Car may be better than new after Mike touches. Put in a Ferrari engine. Don't go backwards. Do it do it.
Dude hell yeah. Stick a GT3 kit on that too
It’s almost like you have to break in an engine before going to a track and going full throttle.
Looks like the dealer was right.
It’s almost like the Mercedes Techs at the dealer are specifically trained to work on these cars and know how to diagnose these cars. Who would of known.
Put a 6 Rotor in it sound insane
LS swap it, bro
ironic number plate
F12 companion ? Strip it and build it like the f12
This guy needs to be firedddddddd!!!!! Bro shop Dollie’s skates carboard n bottle something under the tires to get it of the bed safe n undamaged disgusting operation of a flatbed
What a dip sh!t, thow truck driver sucks
6:24  As one of the techs helping diagnose this car initially at the dealer, it sucks how little information gets transferred from us to the customer on the invoice, so much more was done and storied out however little was given to the customer, but we did so much extensive testing, we were told everything we put would be on the invoice…
Awh, keep the Benz V8, they sound pretty decent with an exhaust. Not as good as the 156 engine tho…
It may not need a motor. It maybe the oil cooler gasket.
Think you should stay all mercedes on that amg and do a colab with Alex from Legit Street Car!! He’s a big mercedes geek! Should do a supercharge c63 swap!!
If you guys care, theres a spot to physically put the key in the ignition. It's inside the center console storage compartment, like under the armrest.
Hellcat swap it!
lsx  swap it
Put hemi in it
Less talking and more work, too much talk
guy with the benz needs driving lessons
Dde rebuild car
The AMG gt uses a Ferrari transmission. You might be able to put  a Ferrari motor in there
kswap
Just from one shop/tech guy to another.  You guys have all that space now. 10 years from now when Mike, Tim, Shaun & Mark all have two projects going at the same time, you’ll find ways to use that space.  You guys are goldfish in a giant pond, you have so much space to grow.
Crap cars, i've known of these completely shutting down for a brake light switch!!
I’d love to see a build on that GTS
Yoooo. Dde is on trending... LETS GOO
Hey guys help get Mike to see this we possibly have a amg gtr motor for sale car just got totaled
thats actually so fire
Love to see a AMG build in the channel
Damon and Ken blocks daughter gonna have to line up a few cars against the honacorn
Same engine as in the Bentley right ?? S54 swap is the best idea I heard 👌
As a tow truck driver I can unfortunately say that rocking cars off the flatbed is very common and does not hurt the vehicle however that front bumper may need some attention
Mike should have this car as a starter build.
should put m5 f90 engine in it hahah
Getting the gt off the tow bed was hard to watch, just seen effspots video too of them doing that to the crashed 458😖
M57 diesel in-line 6
put a Aussie BARRA 4.0L straight six turbo in it with 6 speed manual.....1000hp easy
You can insert the key on centre armrests they hide it right there
Sent it to Mat Armstrong
Mike u should LS swap it
Still waiting for the "supercar".
LS Swap inbound 😅
LS swap it! Put a new Z06 engine in it.
Time to get a deal with ctek to supply a couple of good chargers and a trickle charger for each car
Putta skyline engine in it
Steve Morris builds some pretty impressive motors lol im not sure about Mercedes but I know he does billet Lamborghini blocks and others
Could be lifted headbolts and bad head gaskets. Not really common but could be your case
Strip the interior and engine and build a crazy full electric single speed torque monster time attack car or just get it fully converted to the GT3X race car but hoonigan style big exposed twin turbos
You can still save it, right?
Toyota had their slant motor  The 3sgte
You guys should buy a tow truck like that
Sr20Det swap or a madmike swap and do a 4 rotary Amg! Would love to see a rotary build for “The Block”
Get off my truck
He should Barra swap it
Just swap that 4.0 liter v8 there back and that engines can make also 1000 horse power easily
You guys gotta convince Damon and Dave to get it and put an s54 or s55 in it…that build would be mental
Good looking car i got to say
If am i wrong mike give someone car to repair and give him back
Again another dumb acting video. Anyone that thinks this was someone’s car that wanted to fix it then it ends up in your hands. So with everything needed done suddenly you’re taking on repair projects. Smh. Next thing I see is you will have something happen and you’ll have to move. All the pleas to buy merch I sense problems. Looking back there is no chance that kid was an electrician. The only thing that’s changed there is that painting. Prove me wrong.
we wanna see a v12 in the mercedes
What in the fuck is that tow guy doing
Hey where is the newbee from this channel ?
put a rb or an sr motor in the amg
Call Rob Dahm and ask him to build you a 3 or 4 rotor engine
There are some sick kits for this car man! Buy it Mike! They’re are some sick gtr/dtm style kits for this car
Barra swap it 😄
Put a ford Barra turbo make 1000hp built motor!!!!
Damn I thought that truck driver was damaging the car until I heard what the owner did to it. LOL...and man the number of recalls on that thing...fuck thatttt. what a pos
I will pass the merc to Matt Armstrong…he knows what to do with minimum cost
You guys have to make it a gt race car😅
1200hp Barra i6 turbo engine!
My work van’s diff locked and a tow truck had to jimmy it off like that in the street at 11pm 😅 neighbours weren’t a fan
I would of told the Tow truck driver to chill the F Out.
Sean definitely hates European cars😭
LS swap and twin turbo that Benz. New drift missile
Get an r35 engine
The one plus Min add are going to kill this channel
2JZ SWAP!
What in the world is that truck driver doing.  Just pop the hood and give it power with a power pack and put it into neautr.  For gods sake. And typical mercedes dealership.  Mecedwa enginw diagnostics Check and tourque the wheel nuts A shit still bo crank no starts Aahm yeah you need new engine What The Fuck
Do a dang 2jz in something like the 2jz lambo with fat turbo in middle who else agrees
Put an s55 in it
So they called the guy to tell them the car is fucked the guy said to put another motor In it they told him it would be too much then they want to keep the car and do what the other guy wanted to do with it??? lol wtf
Just repair it, free supercar, there is a guy in poland that makes a wild bodykit for this thing. This should replace Mike's Cayman.
The channel needs this car!!
But Damon and Dave love what what you do for dde
We love you Mike keep up the good job at DDE. you're the boss and keep everything going 😊😊😊😊😊😊
If You Noticed the AMG Cover Have The Apple Tree Logo " Affelterbach " That means That AMG Build In A Headquarters is Found in Germany. That AMG is 💯 Unique 👑 I believe That AMG Needs Some TunapS And electronic check work. Can't wait to See The update maybe Modified If It's Not.
Here's probably a "revolutionary" idea ... I quite enjoyed listening to the guys talking about the problems of the car, the dealer's feedback, etc, etc ... I'd definitely watch a series of a car like this being investigated and fixed ... seeing how they go through the thought process of what it could be, taking stuff off, checking, etc, etc ...
DDE should build Shawn’s runner into a beast off-roader
M156 w204 would go crazy
Om606 and roll coal all over SoCal 😂
You guys definitely need some electric scooter to get around your new HQ, lol
Crazy thing is Josh Laurent is hellcat swapping his amg gt. Hopefully he can make it work
put a barra in it
Seriously though, maybe the LSX is an interesting idea.  Dave's Bentley is plush inside, crazy outside (to be).  This can be crazy inside, then murdered out yet tasteful outside.  Even get an exhaust valve system to go from civilized to psycho.  I wouldn't trust the wiring at all anyway, so it's gone.  Or...a blower out of the hood?....
Head studs corroded and head gasket failed
Before I even finish this video I’m 60 seconds in and I’m a Mercedes driver PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING AN AMG BUILD TO THE CHANNEL MIKE
Would not mind seeing one with a body kit and tune on the channel
Just Ls swap it an call it a day😂😂😂😂
JZ sucks
Uhh, I have to assume that the trans is already fucked? Cause ya know, put it in neutral and PUSH it off? If it was in park that whole time and the flatbed driver knew that, then he needs to pay damages if there are any.
#26 on trending rn. can we just get some more normal candid content like this. no fake hype and crazy stuff. we just wanna see you guys being you
Any rollback operator should have a bottle of Dawn dish soap.  So much easier to shake off a load even with a textured bed.  Could have deadmanned it too.  Could have skated it.  He gave no fcks.
Id say offer him 20 grand maybe he takes it . And swap the engine out for a ls honestly would be cheapest way to get it running and swap it for a manuel. Or just shop around if you could find a cheap amg engine  deffinitly a cool super car excites to see mike have somthing special on the channel. Who knows dde could probably take it out of daves salary help mike out. He is key to the builds on this channel
What I want to know is how does one destroy a GT at 22k miles 🤯
Don't ever let them tow your cars again. That's rediculous
Mike should engine swap with a GM LT4 6.2L Supercharged V8. 650 HP (6th Gen ZL1, C7 Z06, 3rd Gen CTS-V detuned to make 640HP). Very reliable pushrod engine.
Put an AMG V12 from a sl! Put that s$&@ on the main channel and bring Mike out for the next rally!!! 🎉
Mike should actually buy this car and build it.
Old mate must have pockets full of cash to just leave this car for multiple years.
DailydrivenExotics Stories Great Video I think it's awesome that Mike is going to be fixing up his friends absolutely incredible Mercedes AMG GT S and I'm sorry to hear that he crashed at Turn 9 of Willow Springs Raceway then left sitting for 2-3 years and I think it should be Hemi Swapped or LS Swapped and I can't wait to see the Tear down being
Ls1
usually with German cars the oil cooler will be with the water pump .if thay is broke or leaking it sjll mix oil with the coolant .very common on vw /audi
well u ever thought of dropping a cummings turbo in it
wonder where all that water in the h1 starter came from lol
dam he took the te37 off the type r😢
rotary swapped Benz sounds like a pretty stupid good idea to me haha 😂
Imagine the free publicity for towman and his ability to burp your car...
Should’ve changed the oil before starting it
Put a 4.0L straight 6 Australian Barra Motor in it lol
Your car is so beautiful, I'll call the police :)
Put a cummins in it
9:57 Definitely a 4 Rotor. Mercedes way back in the day dabble with Wankel's engines.
So, Mike, Who is “JASON SHAREK”? 😂
Put a cummins in it
Mike should just buy it an rebuild it
Mikes opinion on n54’s??? 😆😆 I wanna see him build one !
yeah ive watched tow truck drivers drag brand new full time 4x4 vehicles off at my work before. even went out and told him theirs a neutral cables to pull. hes said it all good theres no point now. tow truck drivers dont care nor do allot of them even have the knowledge to know better. the car drove fine after but but it horrible standing there with the customer nearby in horror watching the tow truck driver drag this guys suv off the flat bed
Well guys, All he had to do was read the Owners Manual and would have found the  towing release for the Transmission... Hmmm
I think a LS12 would go good in the merc
The mercs what u do when u want to put that manual fob in, the cap of the start button take that off and you can start the car with the manual fob 😊
I say put a s65 in there Mike
Put a v12 in it
i want to see more of mikes build for his car and i want to see tim finish his car!
Ls swap that things
Get a Australian Ford barra xr6 turbo motor for the Mercedes 😮 king 😊
Get it for 10k
Keep the car make something  crazy  go bananas   is a bad ass car 🙏
Such a cool car hope the repairs are cheap and affordable
Flip it
ThT tow truck driver sucks no w9nder the transmission is fukt on it . I can't believe Mike sat there and watched that ass hat do that
I wish they would of explained what the plan was for the car at the beginning. Kind of felt like they were setting it up to just be repaired for his buddy lol kinda confusing
It like Tim’s idea. 4 rotor
I love this... car guys talking car stuff... sonfun. Thanks. To me this is better than watching they guys do burnouts and donuts.  It's like a live action podcast
Nice sports car mike.
LS SWAP
Where did you find that tow truck driver?
Mike is gonna be the new scotto at dde
The entrance to the HQ should be named scumbag alley and it turn into the block
LSA or hellcat it mike !!
Day #3 of asking Dave and Damon to get my Mike a Gt3rs
Hey i work at a mbenz so if yall got any questions hmu
That plate is very ironic
Damon should totally buy you this car… with Dave’s salary ofc lol
What about a hellcat motar
Take out the AMG engine and put a 2JZ or one, four or five cylinder turbo engine out of the Audi RS 3 would be overkill
The new 5.5L C8 ZO6 motor 27:02 😮‍💨😮‍💨
@PFS🙃💯💯💯💯
yall could have used soap on the tow truck bed to get the car to slide
Time to hit up  Alex at Legit Street Cars!
did they check the pyro fuse if its been in a crash that seems to go first when an airbag goes off
Tim has the great idea 4 rotor! 1000HP 4 rotor. It would compare to the Lambo V12 but sound better ;) Please dont LS swap this Merc. Michael Essa needs a badass Porsche project car!!!
Colan with Rob dahm
Open center console key insert is in there
BUY IT !!!!
How to fry an AMG 101 never use jumper cable you can fry a lot of equipement
AWD 12 ROTER!!!!!!!!
Mike I love your thinking, an S54, S65, or S85 would be sick
S54 swap!!
Jz are so over rated there are so ment better motors out ther
Mike's version of the f12  dope car!
Truck driver could tell it was POS
The key button (the ignition button) comes off and there’s a spot to put the key into if the key battery is too low etc.
scammed
Im soooooo down for the Corvette guts swap...Listen to me please!!!!!!  It will be so easy, trash existing wiring, start fresh!!!
the AMG would be a dope car to turn into a drift car to go along with the f12
Y'all cute 😂 gotta give errr  strokes 🎉 also liberty walk the amg. And then you will have room for the turbo if you cut something up or out 👍
Put a hellcat engine inside
I Say RB26
1000hp s2000 swap it
Electric scooter with a trailer for Tim 😂 !!!!
It's me again, yall looking like yall really could use a new great hard working guy I am automobile inclined gre up working on cars I unfortunately got layed off recently as a oil technician.anyways I would love to just come kick it with yall been watching yall since yall started think it was t by e second video the camera view was horrible started throwing up from all the movement hahahaeither way keep it up you guys I'll still be watching
I think dde should buy this and put chassi mounted wing and under door exhaust wide body
You guys should get some "Segways" for getting around the shop...😉👍
You guys need to learn how to get a car off a tow truck without killing it lol
He's an ex Mercedes tech
Aye bruh I want a car LMFAO
What happened to Yuvy
Mike drop a cumins down in that Mercedes lol
N54 on it
can I buy it?
The look on Tims face needs to go on a t-shirt!!!
Why didn’t y’all put the go jacks on it to take it off the tow truck??
“Rip bmr” kinda ironic eh
The owner of that Mercedes is the type of person you want to make friends with, sounds like an absolute legend 🤣
K-SWAP it for the haters 😂
Turn it into a self driving Uber with a nice livery.
AMG GT3 / Drift project in the near future???  🙉🙈🙊
Probably got bad gas in that Merc
4 rotor rotary would be totally crazy in that
do it mike. make that thing DDE
Love to see AMG on the channel!
Mike! You should pull that AMG motor and swap in a M engine from BMW in it!!
I'd drop a Ford GT500 motor in there.
You guys are killing it
PUT A BMW V12 in it and tune it run like the Maclaren F1....
Coyote swap it.
S58 swap that joint please 😘
if you want a reliable Mercedes you go W124 - - - that's as good engineering as you can get.
I actually own a 2017 gts and it has a great motor I'm running methanol and its pushing a over 700 hp.
#23 on trending, we are doing great guys
I would love to see a GT build on the channel.
“ Cough” more Tim’s car!
lol maybe Dave should make an offer on the Mercedes. do another build?
If you're not aware. This video right now is #23 on trending.
I saw that video couple days ago
The key goes under the armrest.
Oh he'll yeah I've been waiting for an amg gt my dream car
As someone who towed exotics and other high end cars, this guy has no idea what hes doing. Could have easily put soft straps on the rear to hold and and just used the dollys they had in shop to roll down instead of shaking it off like its a drop off to copart.
Put an LS in it and it will be fine.
Cool build on dde
omfg... dish soap... its that easy, and that car woulda slid right off the truck
My boy Sean messed up the daily whip for our entertainment lol I think dde should help him out
I like tim idea 4 rotor 😮😮
Put a S55 motor in it please! I’m an F80 M3 owner though so I might be biased 😂
That car needs that Mercedes engine in there. It’s a monster and sounds incredible. It would be cool to see an engine rebuild.
so freaking happy to see a amg on here
Trending! good amount of views as well ! keep er going boys 🤙
M113k swap!
Always hold the key on the centre of steering wheel Mercedes BMW
This would be next good project for Tyler
BMW v10, Aston Martin manual swap, LS might be a bit crude. Or a viper motor?
Not sure if this has been thought about what about a track day have fans pay a certain amount of money to get to ride with Mike on a track day
Throw a 12 valve diesel, in there one of the best engines ever made
Amg gt is one of my all time favorite cars
super charge the 4runner
Everyone is surprised how he was getting the car off of the tow truck wait until you see what he did to get it on that was the easy part getting it off
Sean is comedy 😂
Wait, dealership to track, 90mph off, hit radiator, no water, thrown rod, 10inch kerb, rats....
I say put an LS in it and your GOLDEN!
Junk it it's a pos even with it running it's not dde at all nah sorry
Im watching and eating as per usual DDE time, and as per usual wife is pretending not to watch, but TODAY she makes a comment for the first time: "Whaat are they DOING to that Mercedes??!" with a look on her face lol  I had to crack up.
RB 26
WTF unloading job is that?  He might as well just got in the tow truck and floored it to dump that GT on the ground
Sounds funny, but next time have some plastic trays like you get food on at fast food places to put under the tires. Putting them under the back tires and he could have easily slid the truck out from underneath it.
DDE Style demands you do something unique and crazy with it Mike!
i love those GT R's
hellcat swap it!!!!!! I mean it is a Daimler Product.😂😂😂
2JZ swap the Mercedes and make the turbo run 20 psi
Mite as well Ls swap that dude cheap horsepower and easy to fix
nice to be able to afford a $70,000 brick
Is there a fuel shut off switch in it? If he hit a curb, couldn’t that have been tripped?
Put a Mercedes v12
How about the boys convince Damon to buy it
@17:03 Shawns face says it all.
Whoever is editing Sean's language on the stories channel is a superhero.
It would be nice for Mike to also have a super car. It would fit the DDE branding 🤩
You should do a amg gt black series engine in there
W TEAM AMG  REAL CONTENT
If i was Mike i would put a m120 Mercedes-Benz engine in it you can easy get 1500Hp out of it and you can get a insane f1 sound out of it
LS swap.  I bet that ethanol is solid in those fuel lines.
Had the trans lock up on my C63 when on a roll back, we just hooked up a battery pack and unlocked the trans……👍.  The other thing you could have done is jack it up on the truck fit the trolleys and roll it off without shocking the trans 🤷🏼
Mike seriously get that Benz, that would be sick! Engine swapped would be so crazy.   What would be hilarious and really piss off everyone would be to coyote swap it lolol
Amg gt3 kit
I can totally see Mike making a drift build out of this 🤌🏽
V10 E60
PUT THE V10 bmw engine out the e60 in there
I’m pumped for this Amg build
Make a GT3 car out of it.
Ls swap it!
Put a honda F20C in it
Mike, I have a terrible idea for an engine swap for the amg. What if you put a Judd 4GV v10 formula 1 engine in the amg, I can already see it now fully stripped interior, roll cage, bucket seats & harnesses, race sequential transmission, gt3 style defuser, spoiler, splitter, center lock race wheels, basically all the bad Ideas are rolling through my head about what you could do with this thing
I thought you guys were playing bingo nameing off those motors lol.
I’ve been towing for over 20 years and all I can say is wow. 😂
There is something about those kind of builds that attracts me more than the Senna for instance. Hypercars are cool but I love when you guys dont have to care too much about a car and just have fun with it
Needs a twin turbo ls swap.
That tow truck driver dumping the GT like some dirt off of a dump truck sheesh 😂
LS swap and make a fun drift car out of it. the cost can just come out of Dave's salary.
Built K20A would be a sick swap in this.
Put a viper moter in it
It needs a v12 or an bmw v10 straight piped
D&D Need this as Mikes project.
A little liquid dish detergent under the tires would have helped a lot.
Love these kind of videos👍👍
Put a 1000 HP BMW S58 in that AMG GT
What about a z4 tranny? Also, what would be cool is if you guys rebuilt it and gifted it to one of your young aspiring mechanics. That would be cool to see.
It's going to be mean when Mike's done with it.
Tow truck operator should’ve put skates under it but I’ve been in a pinch with cars stuck in park and done the same shit. He did what he had to🤷🏼
LS swap. V8 twin turbo. Air Recall is almost every manufacturer from those years. No solution to date
The delivery driver wanted that thing OFF his goddamn trailer lol 😂
A build like Dave’s Bentley with this AMG!
I’ll buy it and send a transport
This isn’t mike’s car 😂 its a car from a customer like he said.. we have to wait and see if he buy’s it 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Was this mondi's amg?
Billet K24 turbo that thing. Angry purists everywhere lol
Have you Two ever thought to make beanies to match the hoodies?
RIP BMR on the plate😂😂
DDE SHOP CAR
TAKE IT OUT OF DAMON’S CHECK
@dailydrivenexotixs Why click bait your audience with Mike gets his first super car 🤔 what a slap in his face, to be honest Mike is well over due for his first super car the dude has don't so much for Daliy Driven Exotics and he well deserves his first super car. Get him a Porsche already.
COULD U FIX THE TAILLIGHTS WITH A TORCH ????
I hope Damon and Dave actually get Mike his own Porsche supercar, he deserves it so much.
Let’s see what Dave thinks of the car. It’s his style. Lol
Potential Idea: Michael Essa new drift build of the Mercedes-AMG GT "BLOCK" Series with an M159 GT3 or S68, carbon fiber drive shaft, plasma-cut wheel louvers, hydro-hand brake, gutted but finished interior like the 550, and a Gintani tune and exhaust.
I watch Legit Street Cars LSC, and the first thing he does is remove all the rat nests and checks the wiring to see if anything got chewed through. I think you guys skipped a few steps.
Definitely engine, transmission, and rear axle swap!
Ferrari engine swap into this AMG
As the customer he should be able to request the dtc list. They should have printed a copy and given a good explanation. It also could be because of rodent damage that they don’t want to diagnose it. A lot of dealer techs are babies like that. Not all though
day 12 of offering DDE 3d printing services
Coyote or LS swap
Same Engine as Daves Bentley, just rob his
What up DDE family....I look forward to seeing every new video daily!! I absolutely love how the DDE family loves and supports every member of DDE ....!! Great things spawn Great things!! Hat's off to DDE for producing Great family friendly content!! I hope that all the members and followers of DDE prosper in health, life, and love ✌️
47 recalls.   MB is soooooo over rated.
Tim was correct.  4 Rotor beast!
I drove a truck like that for 12 years he did that all wrong there is a way easier way to do that without breaking the Transmission or rear end
Bro no BMW motor. Swap it to a JZ!!
T4R representing.  I have an 05 v8 as my daily.
You can go with a v10 from the m5 😂😂😂 it would be mad
Considering the mouse nest stuff near the fire wall I doubt the dealer looked at anything under the hood., they just want to sell the guy a new engine
Larry @ammonyc reach out to these boys do a california collab
as a german i have to say this in honor of german cars (all brands)... they only got bad in the last 20 years... and I mean "really bad", not "a bit bad"
LS swap it, put on the racecar body kit, keep the nice interior, and show Dave how it's done on a more realistic budget. And then race each other and take them to cars and coffee to see which one people like more.
S54 turbo swap sounds like the right ideaaaaa!
Pull the push to start button out and put key in
Put a 12 valve cummins in the AMG. Full send lol
I kind of like Tim's idea of 4 turbine. Though the 1000 HP BMW motor would be badass.
That Engine on that merc is a work of art. The potential. Its a Dave car
Throw some pipes out the hood and get this thing spitting flames
all these germans hard to work on,they r so compacted.bumpers radiators and all have to come out to do basic services
Tow truck driver needs soap and water with a spray bottle for these types of situations. 🤦🏻‍♂️
That would be cool side project!
Y'all called the wrong tow truck driver to deliver 😂 I've been doing it professionally for years now and go jacks would of been a good choice along with two skates would of came sliding off with ease
That’s definitely not how u unload a supper car off a tilt and load  so hard to watch
You guys should do a cheaper car and do a give away a porche 😂😂😂
😮throw in a 500hp supercharged gt500 engine. Those engines here in texas run $3k
18:10 sounds like Dave. 😂
tear down to chassis and body work, stare at it for a few weeks whilst ideas get bounced around, then build the sickest viper V10 running gear AMG sleeper
A diesel OM606 would be an interesting swap to do
That’s a Mercedes GTR right? Or is it SLR? Just guessing based on the blacked out thumbnail
Take out the spark plugs poor some of tht  MARVEL MYSTERY OIL in her she would be fine lol  Should be under warranty with the Mercedes warranty must suck
Throw a v8 in it
A single jingle 😊
Mike buy this car and built it drift it break the internet ❤❤❤❤❤
Finally a Mercedes on the channel !!!
Surly have to have rat traps now !!! 😂😂
Sorry more I think about it that tow truck driver needs a new job
Kinda sad mike getting a car of his own isnt main channel content
LS swap it
Where the hell are his skids BMW and Mercedes are bad to get into neutral that's why there's plastic skids even a mc Donald's tray would work and if we're talking bad tesla the worst thing in the world 😅
I absolutely love that Mike wants to put an S54 into the merc! YES MAN!!!
Come on first ls swap for the channel
Look how much room there is for a JZ 🤣
It probably needs a new battery since it’s been sitting for a long time I got a Range Rover sport 2015 and that was sitting for like 5 years and it needed a new battery
The beginning was one of my favorite parts about the new Hq . The dude literally drove a whole tow truck inside . Makes dropping cars off so much easier
get the Mercedes and start a new project and engine swap, 1000 hp
DDE Scooters are a much needed thing now
Put s85 in it!😊
@JoshLaurentt 👀
You should really buy a Noco jump pack
New Project car/build series! This would be dope be a great addition to the current inventory.  Build it and go crazy!
Josh laurent just took his motor out of his buy his motor @joshlaurent
Get a Datson transmission way better than the Corvette transmissions
Duramax swap it Allison Transmission
Diesel swap??😂
had good idea we should roof delete ferrari 599 here the muffler real good
Hey Shawn you still got them jugs of coolant? Mike might need a few 😂
Your tow guy is a moron
Turn it into a 24 hours of lemons race car
I was saying like 4 months ago to team Dde to get a Mercedes and put some bolts on in… then tune it to 950hp….with all the stability and technology this would rip. Not to mention this is my favourite chassis from Mercedes, actually any coupe Mercedes is so nice… motors solid with stock internals… transmissions the weak point… 1000hp Mercedes with the luxury…. It’s perfect
Don’t blame Micheal marling it was the other owners fault.
2 words! HELLCAT SWAP! It’s a Mercedes put a Dodge in it and a stand alone Holly, dominator ECU
put a twin turbo ls in it
With your jump pack. Here’s a quick tip.  I’m a heavy equipment tech for John Deere.  Do you hear how it’s clicking.  That’s bc it’s still in safety override. To truly override it to where it gives full power you have to trick it. Put the ground on and turn it on. Then hit the ! Button to override the safety for the battery cross protection. Then hook up the positive. It tricks the smart part of the charger and gives it all the power for jumping the machine. I use the gb70s and jump 6 liter diesel and the 155 I jump 13.5L diesels
If  it had a manual transmission that would be a problem. 😂
Marc please stop talking. Stay behind the camera, shutup & do your job (you quite literally ruin the element) 😅 Also is anyone else wondering what happened to fourth wall?
this is great.. cant wait to see this Merc get modified
Hopefully the guy can get a nice check for mechanical failure cause the engine  to blow up. Mikes probly thinking what can I get this salvage value 😎 it's hard to find honest people  to fix your vehicle these days get sound advise than to take your 🤑. Dde fam ❤
I mean Tim said a 4 rotor…I don’t hate this idea 😬
See if you can put a S63 or a CLS63 OR maybe try to go nuts and put a GLE OR GLC AMG in there I think you'd have a better chance fitting a GLC 63 motor in there I think the GLE is a bigger motor
I see a dde version of the top secret supra v12 jz 🔥
B18 swap let's goooo
Head gasket at most 😂
lol gotta get the junk off the truck somehow
Jesus Christ
If you didnt put a twin turbo S85 engine in there with a GT3 bodykit on it, that would be a massive shame...
I love that Mark is actually a genuine car guy too
a 383 stroker in that thing would be dope
Put a Bentley W12 engine in it
Fuck it put a viper v10 in it with a big big turbo 😮‍💨
Love the gt. Finally it is on the channel
Aston Martin vantage makes a 6 speed manual which is based on this cars chassis. With the same engine. So that would be the best starting point if you want to do a manual
I wonder if mike likes drifting or racing more idk why but i just think about it here and there
A build that would piss off a lot of people, lamborghini v12 in a ferrari
Yes tim!!!! Dorito the world!!!!!
I'm with tim!!! 4 rotor that baby!
No jz Mike german engineer
Poor AMG. its been Neglected so much...
It popped a head gasket and bent a rod is my guess with the coolant missing and the way it's skipping when turning over.
mark doesnt even know what hes talking about funny seeong the guys correct him  lol
Put a hellcat motor in it
Put a v12 in it
“Michael marling you fucked up” hahahahaha. Savage
OMG an AMG. Nice!!
New Shop Car?
LSx 454, 108mm turbo, 6 speed 🤤
Needs a pagani v12 😈
About time we see a AMG
Finally an amg gts on DDE. Can’t wait to see a supercharged SLS as well
I'm with timmy, needs a turbo 4 rotor
Bro buy a v10 E60 engine an put it on the amg😂😂😂
Would like to see a Mike Vs Dave Gt3 Projects..Luxury on the inside and because Racecar on the outside 😅
I would never hire that tow truck service company ever again. Dude is a lazy half ass pos. All that stress and pressure and weight he was slamming into that rear end and trans and everything drivetrain wise was insane just to rock it off his flat bed? Lol wtf 🤬
Big huge mouse nest visible but we aint going to check the airboxes and just crank it
Put a compound 12 valve in it
You guys need electric mini scooters 😂
Get rid of that garbage engine, and Swap That car With a Cammed Ls7😎. Fuck Mercedes expensive shit
Hey ik it might be irrelevent by now for yall but the key slot insert is in the arm rest console an if im not mistaken the tow hitch when screwed in releases the park on the transmission, i hope one day i can come down an assist with the build of cars an ideas for the channel,cheers🎉
Schake shake ! Oje :) AMG , !:) 7400ccm V12 a option  Call AMG , could help ya . Gut das nicht ... auf der Plackette stehe ;)
No get the fu**ing H1 Duramax Brother take you videmims and say your prayers Brothers😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😂😂😂Lololooolol
Put a rotary in it
Did anyone else notice all the white substance on the hoses? Typical of phosphorus from coolant. I bet it overheated!
Do not jz swap any Mercedes…. That car needs oem engine I doubt it even needs to be replaced….
Buy that cheap for mike 🤔
mike shud start hes own youtube showing the stuff hes does when not working on dde cars but helping hes friends / hes own build that would be cool
Mike Essa buy that AMG! That's interesting content.
Hey DDE. I have the Noco GB40 1000A jump box and it works awesome on dead batteries. If it’s not completely dead the box should jump the car normally but if the battery is really low or completely dead you have to hold the ! Button until the light next to the 12V lights up solid. It’ll then give the battery a super jump with all the power in the pack at once. Sometimes can take more than one try but adjust the clamps. Hold the button til light comes on solid and try again. Mine hasn’t failed me yet. I’ve seen you have trouble in many videos but you never try this so I figured I’d mention it. Hope it  helps for the future!!
Dude must have money to blow. 80k car totaled at 22k miles. Thing was barely broken in
Put a hellcact engine swap
Get a 599 for spare parts for when dave puts one through the fence on the block, and put the 599 motor in the gt! Manual ofcourse!
water combain with oil
That tow truck driver has had to tow a few dead Teslas at some point.
I can see shop bikes on the future or segways
Sean needs to get out of 2004 and realise there’s better engines out there. The AMG 4.0 Biturbo is an amazing engine. New rods and pistons and turbos can take them easily over 1000hp.
That guy doesn't give a fuck about cars
So Bob Bishop Built the Bentley and Mike Marlin Made the Mercedes? DDE all about alliteration lol
Flush the oil and water and change the head gasket
Mike should have used carvertical lol
I like Tim's idea of a 4 rotor. Better talk to Rob Dahm
A 2000-2007 nascar engine with a dog box transmission would be hilarious awesome and scream out of the Mercedes
Bad heat exchanger?
That car definitely blew a head gasket then over heated and then shot coolant all over the engine bay
Guess that tow truck driver never heard of skates... Yikes, so careless... But nice outfit homie
Twin turbo LS swap with side exit pipes
Hope Mike gets it and make this AMG GT a great DDE second channel project!
Lol see yall need ones of these bad boys.m to turn into a street gt3 car.
I think you guys need  To help Tim put a naturally aspirated 4 rotor in  his super car. Not only would it sound amazing it  would be fast as hell.
idk if its possible but u guys should put the v10 motor from e60 in the Mercedes
Cummins Mercedes
Josh laraunt putting in a hellcat mother in his amg gt
Mercedes is well known for electrical issues. 😂
Finally a Mercedes
Can't wait to see the bills everything is talking about love it
I wanna see what the BMW motor in that thing. Abby, a cool thing to watch. I wanna see you at bill with a body kit and everything. I don't know, play you guys wanna do but I know it's gonna come out crazy.
AMG needs a Hellcat motor
I want to see this get worked on this channel 👀
If you have Mercedes……..your best friend better be MIKE😊LOL
put a Barra in it 😂
1 word...... CUMMINS
That tow truck driver should be fired! YSOB!
I see an LS Swap in the future !
What happened to the camera guy for the stories channel?
Mike, I vote LS swap🔥🔥🔥
These engines have a tendency to drop a head off a valve and mulch everything….
Tim has the right idea: F O U R R O T O R
LS7 Swapped, manual transmission; angle kit; Drift missile!!!!
Mercedes drift car
Isn't that the same V8 twin turbo that's in Dave's Bentley!????
Ayeeeeee I see y’all found a good candidate for the s65 engine swap… let’s make it happen 🫡😅
I need Shawn’s @ 😂😂😂 asking for a friend 😂😂😂
2JZ
As soon as you find the devils milkshake its insurance fraud time
Keep it and do your thing 🤫
That merc has dde all over, amg drift machine. The owner of that car is cool. Mike needs a merc drift car V10 Lamborghini engine will fit
Yall got an extra 599 motor 🤷🏾‍♂️
Get it Mike! Love the g63
6:00 # Genius
Please try to save it and gift it to wify
Race car build will be awesome on that
Take the manuel from the newer aston marting vantage for the trans
I just went through the same thing with Antelope Valley Nissan. My transmission was slipping so I took it in to get looked at. They kept it overnight, charged me $200.00 and told me I need a new $5,000.00 transmission. I've been driving it for 2 years now without the problem reoccurring. I took it to an AAMCO dealer and instead of trying to stick it to me he said just drive it until it quits since I don't have any warning lights.
LS swap
Cadillac 4.6 North Star swap it
Please please please Barra swap one of the cars at some point 😊
Brutal.
The Mercedes AMG GT has a key hole in the center console there is an ignition key inlet for the key to go in and start the car manually
You guys should get a quad or golf cart with a rack on it to get around the shop and carry tools and whatever.
Tow truck driver has no idea what he's doing!!😅😅😅😅
I'm sure Damon is up for the challenge with that car.. mike just needs to buy it from his friend.. and take the engine out.. and go from there.. if Damon and Dave bought Tim a whole car.. they can help the boss with some parts or whatever he wants to do with it haha.. that'd be a cool block ripper and a cool drift car..
Should change this channel like DDE shop or something along those lines
Get it Mike!  Would love to see it on the channel
LT4 SWAP .
Get it and put a M5's v10 in it ! a v10 Mercedes Gt would be pretty cool and just to piss off the Mercedes people you got a BMW engine in there lol but it may be to pricy i don't know the prices of those engines but would still be cool 😆
Would be a nice drift car….
Is it possible to swap with 5.0 coyote engine on it
WHy not hook the winch up to it and put some dolly's under it..
If this GT gets parted out or sold for scrap…….I’d like to buy the piano black surround  around the shifter. Keep my contact……thanks…..Lou
I’m f***ing excited for Mikes side missions to become part of the dde tube!! More new car content HELLLLL YEAH 🤘🏻🤘🏻BMW vs Toyota arguments 😂
Blah Blah Blah won't be working on the F12 anytime soon.  It's OK though the Mercedes is too hard to work on, so it'll sit in the DDE junk yard with the others.  Then he'll go back to the car that he's never worked on, that car being the F12, but it's easier than a Mercedes. The V12 in the Ferrari is just like a BMW so not an issue, so you say, total Bull Shit.  Has nothing to do with your dreams - it's about BS verbiage.  Mike's proven himself as a driver, no issues there, he's been impressive on the track. It's not about what you did yesterday, it's about "what have you done lately," it is that simple.  SO, except nothing except more Blah Blah Blah
This car is perfect for a remake of Ratatouille goes to Formula 1
Ok why these cringey thumbnails tho
Damon needs to help Mike build up his 718 once money is steady again... At least a hand brake, exhaust, diff and some AL13's ...maybe a wrap
I'm looking forward to these videos on the restoration process to get back on the road
Ls swap the Mercedes
I owned an F10 the german engineering reliability proved to be non existent.
The key slot is in the arm rest
Sun damage vs salt damage 😅arguably equally destructive
This was one of my favorite  episodes! I love you guys bringing in more technical side of things also! Having mike there full time and being able to do what he did at his shop is content gold! Yall will never run out of content opportunities! Brilliant!
Ironically enough, Michael Merling was known for reliable engines at AMG. LOL! Guess this one bit the dust a little early.
Engine swap the AMG with twin-turbo LSX
Looks like a future Hoonicedes!! 4Rotor Dorito Plant!
Mike's own DDE stories channel project car??????
best content so far thanks .
"Corvette" swap it and use it as a DDE crew drift car / a car for Mark 😆
Yes buy it
buy some crashed gt
id love to see the progression of this thing!! Mike is such a cool ass dude!
Manual swap it 2 599 and and Amg tandum would be sick
Dawn dish soap would of made the offload alot easier... lol
Next stop Copart.
Just built the Motor make it 1500 hp beat Damon’s senna 😂😂
I know a guy building an AMG GT drift car with a 2JZ for the European Championship, guess this would be a fun project car if you get it for the right price
Note to self: Do NOT use that tow company.
$1300 and all they had to do is pull the dipstick out.
I think doing a colab with matt Armstrong on this would be awesome
Get it as a project I’d love to watch that get rebuilt and upgraded
Drop in a real 6.2 V8 AMG engine😏😏
LS or coyote SWAP!
I’ve seen Jeremy Clarkson drift the piss out of that car, perfect car for Mike. They are wicked cars
Coyote swap!
Trade an SL55 for that 👀👀👀
They make skid sticks that go under the tires that make that a breeze. And reduce the chance of damage.
I'm with Tim throw a brap brap 26B in that thang!
New DDE PROJECT!!!
Put a Cummins in it 😂
Put a OM606 in it
Put a hemi in it
Water to air charge cooler ? Drew water in ?
If it would fit, an LS would be awesome in that merc
@daveDDE @DamonDDE Mike need to buy the AMG and build it back to true DDE and driftchampsEssa must luxury aggressive look so he could join on the next big even like gum ball with you guys
It move if put ls twin spin on it it should bus Bugatti asses
Ls swap it
I like where Tim’s mind is…4rotor tho
Throw a HELLCAT REDEYE IN IT
v12 v10 v8 it
2JZ swap!!!!!!!!!
I've got a running S54 if you need it.
NA 4 Rotor would be insane!!! Plus no risk of bending any connecting rods
K24 turbo if space is an issue
U guys should have just poured engine oil on d tyre track it woukd have slide down instead of d dumb idea that coukd have damaged the transmission.. Or use dully
When you get a new engine. Strip the old one to see what went wrong
Sounds like to me itd be a perfect car to take apart and make a race car! Just an idea maybe a diff v8 idk
Boys need some warehouse push carts (aka mouse carts) for the new HQ cause it’s so HUUUGE!
If you 2JZ swap it please try and keep the original transmission
You can tell the car had a coolant leak. Look at the residue on the pipes
Sounds like a blown headgasket.
i love that merc!
Finally a Benz ✅✅✅
If  Michael Kubler built the motor it wouldn't have any issues
DODGE DART SLANT-6
Under the centre consol there should be lever/switch/tab to put the merc in neutral.
This is what was in the corner next to the F12 in the last video
What causes camshaft to break in 2?
You should get connected with legitstreetcars from Chicago. I'm sure hill get that car fixed
Mike....Buy it for nothing and just part it out!  Put that money into Tim's car!
Cars w/o air bags
Idk if Cadillac had any recalls like that
Marks lack of knowledge of cars is really starting to get at me if you don’t know that’s fine but stop making stupid comments
Back in 2017, someone had a brand-new Mercedes-AMG C63 suck up some water on the highway and the engine was hydrolocked. The bill for just an engine replacement was $75k so the insurance company totalled the car. That car was purchased from the insurance company and someone LS swapped it.   Long story short, the AMG GT and the AMG C63 share the same motor. Mike, you should keep this car and do an LS swap! At least the exhaust note will sound pretty close to the 4.0 that's in there now, and those cars do sound good!
New project for dde. I think you can fit even a v12 in there. Imagine an s600 engine in this, with the proper exhaust it will sound like a pagani...
@MatArmstrongbmx might be intrested ininterested in it ! Give him a shout !
LS it Mike.
Left bank running lean?
How can you tell if a cars in neutral if the truck didnt stop
Where is the super car ?
Dont laugh Shawn Toyota had the same deadly airbag shrapnel recall😂
That Benz would be a sick 4 -rotor.
cant believe Damon and Dave allowed this on company time
2j all the way ooooor ! R35 drive train with a few upgrades yum 😋
It's too bad u can't just buy a basic car without all the bells & whistles & things not needed at an affordable price without paying $1300 to look at it or in my case $1800 to replace roof issue in my suv
V12 engine swap
Good to see some german
Dude please put a twin turbo LS in this beast with a stand alone motec !!!!
Tow truck driver: “Let me just destroy the parking pin real quick and it’ll come right off”! 😂
Mark can be so cringe when it comes to car talk.... You have a typeR and you don't do reverse donuts in a lsd fwd on pavement.. Should modify it would kill a corvette any day with Bolt-ons... Love the videos... Check out my one off bmw with costom one off no other car will have this wrap more rare than your Senna wrap!
Every new car since 1994 or before
swap in a built german 2j the mercedes m104. boosted
So basically this Mercedes-Benz 2dr = what VGG would find out in the field?
Dude said it’s ready for a jz when u can put a easy tune to drift
They fired the new guy who was doing the stories filming? Good idea to keep costs low but sad too!🫡🫡🫡🫡
Mike, I have the same jump box you tried to use 1st. There is a bypass programmed into it the opens the circuit to allow open charging. Bypass is as follows: press power button to power on. Press both the power button and light/usb button and the same time for about 10 seconds. You'll hear and click and see the green power light flash.
Putting oil to the surface of the flatbed wud of done the job in the slippery buisness..😂
Josh Laurent has a motor and Damon and Dave know him
.... GOD DAMN :-D that BENZ drove one 8 years ago !! they are sooo cool. And doing a custom one !! that would be 100% as cool as Daves Bentley build.
do like the youtuber josh lerant has a motor he is doing a hemi swap inn his
Mike bmw v10 in it and a gt3 kit
If it had been me in that shop, the truck would place front wheels on those ROLLERS & then drag off unfortunately maybe with forklift.
Blown 427 AMG GT
Nah..  The S85B50 V10
Put a diesel in it
There has to be a way to put that car in neutral manually🤦🏼‍♂️
Could you buy this? Engine swap it with a rotary
As a mercedes owner I completely understand they are the most annoying car to fix  My v6 (not a sports car yet lol gonna make it abit more sporty) has a slight miss that we can't seem to locate where it's coming from 5k later and we still can't find it  and gosh finding part for it here in New Zealand is even harder lol
That tow truck guy never heard about dish soap on the bed and plastic skis 😂
Put a hellcat crater motor in it
Viper engine
Must be a slow day on the editing floor you guys could have spent this up a little bit
The AMG has so many problems with it that it makes me wonder if the guy that designed it even has a job anymore because WOW
Whipple lsx swap for the win!!!
Tell demon to put a gt3 kit on that merc because race car 🤯
😂😂😂 love it.. Mike vs Shaun 2jz vs n54 build battle.. letsgooo
LS swap that car
“RIP BMR” How pathetic 😭🤣🤣 6:53
Mike deserves a better car than this Damon...it's Mike not Sean dawwwggg
def see if damon and dave want to it fix and prolly sell? lil investment??
Mike you should definitely take that car off his hands.
turn key is in the center console on GT's of that era
AMG with BMW motor that will be funny 🤣
Twin turbo LSX swap
Yall need to invest in one of those electric Power Pushers or Car Caddies or something to help you push all these broken cars around. I work at a dealership/Repair Shop for Chevrolet and we use them ALL the time. They're SUPER crucial. Highly Recommend.
Idk about you guys bout I’m the dude to ask the tow truck driver if he needs me to show him how to do his job. 🤦🏼‍♂️like bruh
That car would be a detailing dream will the right detailing it will be like brand new..
Basically your friend has trashed the car  If you can get it at a decent price I think it would make a decent project car for the channel  Go for it if you can get it a price, would make great content for the channel  Awesome piece of kit if you guys would go for it Really would be interested in watching this one
That car would rip tires though for sure
well damon is building the Ferrari v12 engine just make that fit XD lots of power and just say it´s a bonus :)  v12 ferrari merzedes would be sick or a v12 lambo engine O.o   screaming mercedes
id say use this car in place of one of the barriers to protect the fence, or as a prop in the store.  sounds like a huge waste of money to make it "new" again.
To be fair my mercedes dropped all its coolant into the gearbox so this was expected with it
I think Mike should buy it and just find a crashed one and put the engine in it and use it as a daily
Concince Damon to buy the Mercedes and convert it into his drift car. It's a really sexy looking car, and with some TLC and modifications, it will Rip!!!!
I’m sorry to comment this but please do that v8 swap as much as shaun hates ls platform you can make a craaaaaaaaazy car from that
These videos are cool hell yah👍🏽
The owner of the Mercedes sounds like a cool dude.
Daniel Correia, a portuguese driver in DriftMasters, drives a e92 with a 1000hp Merc engine, maybe you do the opposite and druve a merc with bmw engine ahah
1000% buy it, replace & rebuild the engine, hybrid turbos. Send it to the moon.
If only they knew the key insert is in the center console when you lift it up
18:19 quick tip: The starter doesn't have enough torque to bend a piston rod. The more you know 🌈
Dde needs that
Would love for Mike to get his first super car!!
All that stuff in there and no jumper box 😂😂
Love how the license plate reads "rip bmr" (3:06), yet it's the benz that ain't going places #rekt
Yo Mike, Toyota were leaning engines back in the 80’s, when did BMW start?  (Check Tim’s car’s 3S-GTE). 😊
if it has a EGR cooler, if it breaks it will mix and fill the motor
Why not put a M156 engine in there. Would be tasteful as it remains an AMG and takes the NA 6.2l V8. Would be sikkkk
put a lambo v10 in it...
Insane car ... I'd love one. The interior is sick af  😙👌🏼  Awesome car.
Mike needs it and d16 Honda motors are junk and can’t make any power send it off to boostedboiz and let them k swap it 😂
This is a good opportunity for DDE to build a drift or gymkhana car with an engine swap.  Mike the key port is in the armrest in the AMG GT's
Mike go with BMW V10 engine they’re going $8000 . With Two year warranty. Then Rear Twin Turbos to it.
Mike should keep the Mercedes gts as his project car and fix the car with new engine and put a manual transmission
Please hear Tim out😭🙏
yall need a real booster pack!!!
Cummins!!
Spark plug
Give it to mat armstrong to fix, i think he would enjoy that one.
ask Alex from @legitstreetcars :)
Put a 1500 hp diesel motor. Roll some coal
This smells fishy...Maybe another one of Daves skits?
So because it needs a new engine how about a built C63 AMG block and if your already building it get a custom transmission to get it hybrid for some insane torque
I used to do that for work move those cars everywhere
Mike keep that car.
Bob Bishop built a Bentley and Michael Merling made a Mercedes
Lol those plates on that AMG are so contradicting.
If he wants to get vehicles off the truck like that, CARRY FVCKING SOAP AND SORAY IT IN FRONT IF THE TIRES!!!! Come on man wtf
Buy it for 50k and build a block car.
Rebuilt my Benz motor. Had a cracked piston.  Benz wanted 13k to repair. I did it myself for about 1200. Learn to turn a wrench. It will save you a ton of money
In the center console there is a slot for the  key
Hmm hellcat motor in the AMG Mercedes hmmm 🤔
thats got to be one of the worst tow truck drivers ever
Main channel plssss
ask dave, he wants a drift Merc.... with cherry interior
they should have put water infront of the tires it would have slid off easier just on the bed of the wrecker those beds are ice when wet
i’ll take it for 23k  real offer !!!  Don’t ruin it please.. just disassembly engine and change head-gasket and a rod if it’s bent.. it’s german engine , it can handle that
mike is so cool hes my hero
Put some powerful AMG motor there.
Engine swap to the the m156/m159 v8 add an angle kit and hydro
im part of the mercedes community i wouldnt care what engine goes in there i would put a M4 engine in my car if i could and piss off everyone
Sick of hearing “JZ”…there is nothing exotic or super car about any thing Toyota…this isn’t a “fast and furious” channel 🤦‍♂️
OR you get the m159 NA engine for it. should work with the same transmission? gt3 body kit. could also just replace the engine and tune it for like 800-900.
Definitely overheated see all the coolant splatter
That is one beat up gtc
Swap thebmw v8 in
I personally will help fund this project if mike buys it
RB IT 😂😂😂
Put a hellcattttttt engine in ittttt
4 rotor 🎉
should do a 5cyl turbo rs3 engine for the amg gt
Wtf is that tow truck operator doing ? Yea garentie he's done that before
Get @legitstreetcars on this one
Pyro fuse lol? That would been first thing I looked at
Or u can rebuild it cam it out
FIX ITTTTTT
Call up legit street car. He's the Mercedes Guru.
LOL JUST PUT A BADASS 4 CYLINDER IN THE MERCEDES FOR FUN
2jz it.... willow springs lack of safety is a joke.... specially with all the money in Cali.... they shoul've sorted out the runoff decades ago
How you didn't know that all automatics can be put in neutral manually, there should be a hidden lever in it.
Please guys don't let Tim walk to many miles.....buy some of these electric scooters .....i recon you will modify them for a drift in the new HQ
Put a hellcat motor in it
Mike needs this car so he can go on rallies and events with the Guys.
25:04 YESS! #BMW 💯🔥🙌🏽
It hurts my soul to see Mike hooking those jumper cable negatives directly to the Mercedes negative post. Shouldn’t do that, it could explode the battery…
Shawn you need to broaden your horizons and learn the DDE way and start to appreciate things and engineering outside you “box”
CANADIAN SUPERMAN APPROVES
The car that lasted one day! 😁 A great story to be featured and be part of the channel.
Barra ?
You may have to put mic on everyone.  Audio is pretty poor.  Can hardly hear sometimes
buy the car and b58 turbo that thing and use the stock b58 cover😂
Josh Laurent is putting a hellcat engine in his amg
Mike needs this car,  chop the top, roll cage and ls swap this thing or if anything the same engine he has in his drift car .. need this sliding sometime soon.
Should have put  dish soap under all four tires on the flatbed. The car would have come off a whole lot easier.
Quality towing Not really
COYOTI MOTOR OR FORD V8
Tim knows what's up, a 26B swap would make that Merc pretty cool.
WA ABOUTA A BARRA SWAP KINDA A 2J
I guess the tow truck driver doesn’t know the trick to get vehicles like that off quickly…it’s called brake fluid…a little in front of the tires and it would have come off by the 3rd bump. Rookie…
JZ SWAP
Hell yes! im buying this car in the spring. so happy you guys got one!
Put a new c63 engine in it. It’s worth it the potential tune u can do with those engines are insane. I think you should make it a drag car or a GT race car
That type r tho 😮‍💨🔥
Put it all on Dave salary and make it a DDE car
K24
you should mod a DDE golf cart for the shop.
We have a 2015 gt with a DME tune. I love it. It’s one of the best cars to come out in a long time. And it’s very underrated.
You guys need a car wash/detailing bay. You’ve got the room for it.
Damon buy Mike this car is the perfect project for him
If anyone can get this car back to normal working order it's these guys. They should also watch for escaping vermon- you don't want them running into the building- you'll have another problem enriely.
Oooo my god that tow truck driver just messed that car up he don't even no
I thought these were closed deck design?
Mike you better buy that
Would love to see a 2jz in it !
put sand down on the bed and the car will slide off
14:20 Lool Legend 😂😂
Gotta love the way Mike walks like a badass
Possibly engine harness damage, run codes
Audit the audit is great on explaining the situation DDE
Tesla swap
You definitely need to make sure there's no more rats in that Mercedes before leaving it in the garage with all the supercars
Sean offering 5k for the broken Mercedes, but his 20$ hood struts are blown haha
No way I literally just bought an AMG GTR today, get home and sit down to watch DDE and you got one too. Mines in better condition than yours though 😅 Try and fix it up the AMG engine it’s an absolute tyre shredder stock and can easily get 1000+ BHP out of them 👍
That would be a dope gymkhana car haha
pull the engine out dismantle it and you will see if you can rebuild it or if you really need a new engine.
Ls turbo it
Quick question, I work near an airport so I hear military jets and private jets all the time at work and that's normally when I watch your videos is on my lunch break. Are you guys closer to an airport in the newer HQ or am I hearing Jets overhead here the last few videos I hear a jet every once in a while when you're at the garage and I look around where I'm at and I don't see a single plane in the sky. Am I going crazy or are you guys closer to an airport
Why don't you guys speak to Alex at https://www.youtube.com/@LegitStreetCars. He's s pro who worked for Mercedes for a while. Not questioning your skill or abilities... but likes to 'tinker' with these cars...
The tow driver’s technique was flawless, idc what anyone says.
Get alex from lsc out!
DDE should buy the Merc off Mikes Friend and let the boys JZ swap it!!!! Whats the worst that could happen lol!! Its buggered anyways!!! Lol 😂
It would be awesome to see Mike and Sean put a 2J in this and whip it around the block
Y’all need to get all those cars out of there now !!! Or Tavarish is gonna have all kinds of flooded cars to rebuild !!!! It’s going to flood !!!!!
Through it away and get a Porsche. I wouldn't mess with it.
Jesus how to destroy a transmission, .........! Great towing comp[any,i guess he is paying for a new trans,NOT! And it almost sounds like the dealership was to lazy to do a real mechanik check that they only did a OBD read out.  I see a new driftcar project with great opportunities!!!!!.
Wait I know a guy that does this as a job....... MATT ARMSTRONG?????
there must be a nuetral switch somewhere and i bet its something that can be fixed on the cheap.
Interesting build!! BTW Josh Laurent Having someone Hellcat swap his AMG GT. cant wait to seethe direction of the build on this one tho..
Funny episode 🤣 😂  "it doesn't make it go faster "
Considering how many of the DDE cars have amazing sounding engines and exhausts. If Mike wants to stand out amongst them a screaming 3 or 4 rotor would do the trick. 😉
These engines are knows for hydrolocking when water comes inside. So yea just put a S65 engine in it. 6.0 v12 biturbo from Mercedes thats or just a regular 4.0 v8 from Mercedes could be a C63 engine or what ever
Put a Vette drive train in it and watch the Mercedes folks have a meltdown 🤣
S58 swap it🤣🤣🤣
twin turbo scat pack engine 6.4 v8 would be insane
Hahahaha mike is the best BMW boy!!
Ls swap it 6.2 corvette engine
1:06 "It's got Mercedes issues."  Whatever happened to the German engineering everyone's always raving about?
Rat looking for water. Head gasket
Vote for rotary engin 🔥
i see why josh laurant took his engine out now lol
LS swap
A little soapy water on that truck bed would have made that Merc slide right off.
Just drag it off with the forklift, wtf is that driver doing?
Mike needs this car and give it the F12 treatment!!!!
Put LS1 and procharger
100 grand to fix it? they literally cost less then 100k used , wtf😂
Day 7 of asking the boys to bring back the JDM Space
Do what Dahm does.....4 rotor!
Im surprised you don't have some sort of dde podcast...
The list of recalls is peak German engineering right there.
Get that car big Mike. Put a lambo v10 inside
So THAT'S what was under the red car cover!😮
Would need to make it manual to be worth my time fucking with that thing..
car need a M45
just leave the car at the block, no need to tell your wife dude
Mike needs the new gt3rs
Only swap the amg community will respect is a ls with turbos..
LOVE THIS! Grats Mike  Love these amg's. Amg 16' flat grey with solar beam wheels. . . ooooowweeeee
You guys need golf carts to get around the shop!
Would love to see this car as a side Project on the Stories channel. There could be some wicked stuff to do with that thing
This car is amazing!
Plate said RIP BMR 😂😂😂
Just LS swap it
The key goes in the middle console compartment
LS swap simple easy cheap!
Mike! 🙏pro tip. If you see a rat's nest under the hood. Check air boxes before attempting to crank engine.  I have seen some things. Fyi. Rats love wires. Be well and keep up the quality building and thank you for sharing your love and talents with everyone brother 🙏👍🤙🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Sehr schönes Auto ❤
I’d love to see a 6cyl 2 step beast from that thing.
Dude definitely put antifreeze in his oil fill. It happens all the time on these AMG GTs
Put a vr in it
lol put a Cummins in it don’t be a pussy
Put a rotary in that thing!!
V12 Gang!
M120 Mercedes v12 engine and make it sound like a pagani!!!!!
Throw in the v8 from the 4runner but meaning get a 1uz and add twin turbos
May I suggest you guys repave the block? 2:32
13B
K swap it
Dealership will not go in details
That car will be a black hole.
Throw your favorite engine in it put a sequential gearbox in it, and a handbrake and send it
Do a coyote platform swap on it! The high revving voodoo engine with a pair of turbos!
Holy crap doesn't the trans have a manual unlock like every other car!?
They deserve a raise
K series amg would be crazy
Put an ls in it
I second putting an LS motor in there! 😅
That mercedes does seem to need a whole new drivetrain, haha chuck an old corvette motor in it
Cummins swap!
Definitely put an LS TT in that Merc 👌
That guy treated that poor car like crap.
Hey, those single cam Hondas can now make 1000hp! Maybe try one?  But how about a BMW V8 with enough hop-up and an exhaust that makes it scream like the M3 GTR...thats tasty as well
I feel bad for the owner of that Mercedes.  I have a feeling he is about to get lowballed buy his good "friend" LOL.
Put a 632 Chevy motor in it 😂😂😂
Tow truck driver destroyed the transmission
So I figured out what the License plate means RIP BRN. It means Rest In Peace and Burn
Think DDE Needs A Couple Golf Carts, Or The Tool Carts
DDE first 4rotors?
Hey, you guys need to do some YouTube Live events, and put a couple of cameras in  the shop and livestream... Hell, I would do a monthly subscription to be able to tune in and watch what's going on! Great video, but when it ended, I was like "What? That's it!" lol
Tow guy has zero idea what he was doing....
new block car
The sf90 does look just like a vette
k24 swap :D that would be funny af
There's a good engine right infront of that car😂😊
That Gt got properly DDE'd and owner didn't give a fuck  😂😂😂😂  What a savage
Jz with all the nitrous
The tail and front lights, you can briefly run a torch over and theyll look new. For matter you can do it to all the plastic.
LS swap
LS it the Benz…
Sorry about them comments but i just had a major life change ...LFA LFA LFA
Build a toyo motor .... Damon you always talk avout an LFA....BUILD ONE!!!
You guys can either park it in the block to do drift tricks around or build your spare F12 motor de tune it, so it can’t be blown by somebody playing around in it, and you guys have another skidder with a big beautiful motor
You can turn the key in the mid compartment (the “armrest box” when you open it inside you should have the key slot)
Illicit piss off the Mercedes world
The JZ always works
I think a Hennessy Hellephant or Mammoth motor is just the ticket for this beast. Ooooohlala
Sorry lots of comments but i only know toyo and the 4.7 minus the the belt 😅
Buy it for 10g and rebuild it!! Lots of potential
Love to see a Benz coming to the channel, or to mike in this case
And how many recalls on the 4.7 aka jz
"How to ruin a $100k Mercedes w/o even putting 20k miles on it"
A gtr doesn’t cost 70k they range up to 170k. So you got a steal if you bought it for 70k
I was Mike I would just tear it down and pull the motor and trans see what’s happening and fixed the right way. Replace the tail lights and wrap it with some bad a** rims and sell it
hellcat engine swap ?
Hold the pedal to the floor it shuts off the injectors then load it up with starter fluid
There is almost the same car in Grand rapids.mi.for sale on marketplace for 60k..
The 4.7 needs a belt water tensioner
NASCAR V8 swap the Benz!!!
Comment just to comment
That man literally shouldve just gave me the car instead of letting it die. I wouldve taken excellent care of it. Kept up in maintenance, done some mods, kept it in the garage, whole 9
That tow truck driver needs to learn the soap trick the car would have slid right off w/out putting so much stress on the trans… Yes ik it’s stuck in park and already needs a motor but it’s better than causing more damage
Snatch out the motor Throw in the 06 mercedes v8 with the super charger
Build the motor for sure and keep it, considering the thing cranks I don't think the mice got to the wires too much, those AMG motors r meant for rebuilds lmao
Was that 3rd gen
All jokes aside that Mercedes can be fixed
And Sean has the v8 duh
Dealer mechanics are getting dumber by the hour
Would highly recommend using Off bug spray on the break lights will definitely look brand new
That vintage turd used the same security system as Chrysler those shitty odd keyboard you pop into a hole on the dash. There is a red ir light that looks into the soul of thr remote key. The tip of that remote thing has to be STUPID clean
When i was about to go off, i went outside to the softer dirt because of the videos.....
Why did the plastic panels stop? I had one friend say they are necessary for air flow and sound! I think its all a gimmick 😊
@legitstreetcars the boys need advice
I love DDE. I haven’t been excited to get up to watch an episode of ANYTHING in a long time. I remember as kid waking up early on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons. With DDE it’s Saturday morning everyday for me!
tims face when the driver started rocking the amg, priceless
Maybe pur a build motor that can hold 1000 hurs purrr
Amg gtr body kit lets go mike!!!
That Benz was coming off that tow by any means 😂
1000whp k series with a corvette transaxle would have the benz boys freaking out 😂
Yes just yes Mercedes is sweeet
Dude never hear of using dishsoap to get the car to slide off apparently.
theres a guy in vancouver with a 70 or 71 Datsun 240z with a 2jz in it. pisses all the og nissan guys off so hard. probably cuz its faster then all theirs!
Legit Street Cars channel would be able to fix this thing! He's a Mercedes expert! You should collab with him!
The key emergency ignition is in the center console like the SLR just in case
That wrecker driver needs to keep Dawn dish soap in the wrecker. It helps slide cars of the rollback when they are like this.
Must be a rookie tow truck driver or he was out of soap for the deck…
Seems like that engine is used in a lot of AMG products.  There must be wrecked sedans that would supply a fresh engine.  If the rest of the drive train is good, it might be salvageable.  I'd be concerned about the wiring being the headache that never ends.
LS da shit
RIP transmission
So I've gotta watch this in 720p if I want to watch in 1080p I have to pay £15 a month( no where near worth it)......Microsoft are litterly killing YouTube 😡😡😡😡
Mike needs a GT3 or GT3RS👀👀
love the number plate 🤣
Aye first stories video that doesn't include a lunch break lol.
And I did the transmission is not connected to the motor itself like the Corvette
You know you’ve got money when you can leave something like that sitting outside not giving a f*** about it getting ruined lol
Thats my dream car mike 😍 hope you take it on
The AMG seats are about 4k on ebay.
I want to see the build of the Mercedes
Put a Mercedes V12 in it like the ones that come in the  pagani huayra that would be sick The sound will be ridiculous and I don't think anybody's ever done it might cost some money
I like tim's idea throw in a rotary in that Mercedes.
a little skid plate under the tires? splash of soap? Mickey then it didn't start or didn't start then Mickey? NO unwanted guests chewed wire test!
Mike should definitely try to get this car if it's salvageable, it'll make for a crazy variety of cars.. not to mention how sexy a widebody AMG GT looks 🙈
Mike taking over the compound to work on other peoples' cars
That car will be "the slut" it'll have a piece of all the big boys.
Mercedes keys point is the start button if you pull the cap of the start stop button it will show the whole for the key put the key and fire it up happy days
Put a lsx in the Mercedes
The tow truck drivers first day! He could've least put some type of lubricant on the bed to help it SLIDE OFF 🤦‍♂️
I have the same exact car hopefully y'all see this the button to put it on neutral is literally by the shift nob it's a little square where you push with a flat head or anything long
big turbo 4g63 swap
the way he unloaded the car was so ghetto lmao
How about a S85😮
I love sean he's such the jdm fan this channel was  missing
As much as I like the crew, I REALLY REALLY feel like they are not doing what you Hired them for. Completely taking advantage of their positions. It doesn't take four of them to do EVERY task. I. E.  Unloading a car.
@legitstreetcars is your guy for Mercedes cars.
Why don’t you get electric scooters so you can move around the shop
I'm currently in the process of gutting my 01 C320 to turn into a drift car and I can vouche for the fact that mercedes engineers are both absolutely genius with a lot of stuff, but still leave me questioning what the fuck was going through someone's head with some stuff. Like the wiring, thank God I'm ripping 80%of it out 🤣
Please send me this car, I will fix it 😢
no no no no no no no no noooo
If u build this on this channel we will surly watch
2jz swap
Could be the spark plugs and starter
Drop a bmw diesel motor in that thing👀👀
Yeah just put a JZ or an unreliable rotary 😂😂
Man.  All Sean’s cars have power steering issues lmao.
Speak to Matt Armstrong sure he had a car with the very same issue
Ayooo Mike Essa if you put a v10 twin turbo in that Mercedes it will be legendary, Mercedes fan boys will go crazy 😂😂😂
The engine bay has been Borged.
Twin turbo Lamborghini v10 engine swap
Love having Sean in the crew need to get this man a car
Found out what car I will never buy
Poor Mercedes 😂
Twin turbo LS that thing Mike....
Sean is my Spirit animal lol Real Dude / get a channel for your cars - you keep breaking lol. I like that IS - I got an RC myself #Economy haha
A bmw motor swapped AMG GT will be insane 😅
Hey if it doesn't run Josh Laurent just motor swapped his to a hellcat so he has that motor the amg one probably still
Next time you have a dead use cardboard to help the wheels slide.
Don't mess with eu engineering.
Michelle merging built the amg ❌️bob bishop build the bentley  ✅️
Mike should take on this project
Put a diesel engine in it
please BMW swap it, it'll be so funny seeing the people reaction when you pop the hood after you gap them. and then add a dde touch
You gotta K swap it. That ought to piss people off lmaoo
W mike and the boys for helping a friend out and taking the time to fix someone else’s car
WE NEED THIS AMG GT PROJECT CAR!!!
Bro.. just double check the oil coolers side,water might entering from it..cheers
BUGATTI ENGINE IN the AMG🤣🤣
chop it, LS, drift missile
i once encounter a car like that the car went to 3 different shops including the dealer and no 1 would take it or wanted to charge more then the car was worth then they took it to my job and no body wanted to take it on exept me i found 3 rats nest the abs wiring was eaten and the ecu  and the air suspension line front driver side it was a 2009 jagular don’t remember the model i fix the wiring with a old harness out of a ford and swap the air line car ran like new still had a bad smell
im sure Daves bentley motor will fit LOL
Sean is my type of vibe. DROP A JZ IN THAT MERC!!!
Mike's first supercar is Porsche rival
Ls swop it
Mike that is my dream car. I am currently working on myself so one day I get to own one of those and wide body it. Lucky you to get one. Congratulations 🎊👏💐🥳
lets go DDE!!!! get that CAR for MAD mike!!!!!!!! He deserves and needs a supercar!!!!!........ DDE!!!! DDE!!!! DDE!!!!!!
It will be good dde series a fully build amg engine and race kit Mercedes will be something new
Swop it out for a Mercedes M120 engine, same engine used in the Pagani Zonda
Mad Mike and Rob dahm colab anyone
Mike buy that car and make something crazy 🦾🦾🇺🇸🇺🇸
this car with the gt3 body kit to give Dave a run for his money.....
That was so funny. Sean has some serious whit. Take the engine out of Dave’s Bentley 🤣🤣🤣, or failing that 427 stroker small block with a pro-charger. Love these guys. 🤣🤣🤣😎😎😎👍👍👍
Finally an AMG to the channel!!! So much potential in those cars. Cant wait to see what Mike does with it! ❤
Stick an rb in it
"Cameramen and the camera never dies" Proved!
Mike let it go, your to busy. But could be another DDE BAD IDEA LETS GO!!!!!!
You have to put a thousand horsepower k24 in that thing
Perfect, a DDE project car!
It's great to finally see an Amg GT on the channel, you should make a project on that car for the main channel. You should check out the Pajak Carbonerre body kit, it's insane !As an owner of one, I would like to see the maximum amount of madness that could be achieved with this engine.
Tow truck without remote.   Yeah… 2024
rope in dave and damon lol content
Awsome car I have to have it shooting flames like Alex
You should get some advice from YouTuber Alex at Legit Street Cars. He has extensive knowledge of Mercedes, as he was a Mercedes Tech.
U guys need a golf cart to get around
Guys should wall mount a winch on that back wall for this type of event.
Because it has a long engine bay I would put a twin turbo 4 rotor in it mike please it will make the channel abit of a change
LSx and a six speed
some one tell that roll back driver to use dish soap
Ngl, swapping an s600 engine in the car would be crazy!
Go for rotary
1UZ swap would be the right and sort of equivalent engine right
Take notes Dave check engine lights need to be checked
If Mike does purchase that from his friend.. I would definitely make sure you fully inspect that vehicle and know what you’re getting yourself into before you offer any type of offer, because that doesn’t look cheap… so much damage.
That tow truck drive had no clue what he was doing. A little dish soap on the deck and the car would’ve slid right off.
2nd gen Cummins swap
The plate😂😂😂
I mean imagine if you v10 swap it
This would be a cool project car for Mike. I do love AMG’s but this looks to be a lot of work. Hope he can find the time to bring this beast back to life!!
Finally !!! A Merc on the Channel
merci its all about the compression
Great car! Do a manual transmission swap on it!
Some dawn dish soap would of worked wonders if that damn tow truck driver would've had some handy 😂🤡
You guys need a cat or dog in The block named Block 😊😊
I'm sure Damon and Dave are gonna help out with costs on this build Mike. They love you and if the comments want the car they'll help you out so the car can become a driver sooner than later.
I feel like you could name off 100 cars and Sean would still be saying, "Yeah it's ready for a 2j". lol
But a rb26 in it
Don't don't don't!!! This car is only sick because of the powertrain...rest is printed sheet metal and faulty electronics
The old 6.2 AMG engine in this would be unreal with a supercharger maybe
its like the tow truck was mating with the merc😮
If Mike needs a transaxle, don't they still have the F12 one. When they are going after crazy.
put a twinturbo s600 v12 engine?
Do not put a JZ in that car
S85 v10 swap ???
The chassis straight 😂 but I fucked that up too lmao dude is a savage 😂😂😂 I hit a curb losing it in a turn doing 90 😂 it was born on the track and it died on the track !!! You know that guys rich !!!!! I love him already lets meet this client Mike! He sounds like DDEs type of guy lmao 😂 You fucking physcopaths
Argh, this was under the red cover in the corner next to the F12…
BMW M5 V10 MIKE
put a stroked s85 with a blower on it stopppp lieng to those people s85 the world!!!!
That's exactly what I was thinking, a 2jz
Put a hellcat motor in it
4 Rotor swap
Man guy beat the crap out of that car, he's a DDE at heart.
I would just sell the amg for what it do instead of putting money and time into it
Mercedes Benz. Supposed to be the best right now No way  BUT its possible to fix🤔 and i can see Michael essa turning the Mercedes  into a drift car🤔😂
I agree with Mike.  2jz's are way over rated.
That’s sickening to watch that Mercedes being unloaded
DDE FOREVER❤❤❤
That car looks like a nightmare to get back up and running.
That’s Mercedes techs hate fixing anything old lol they told me to buy a new car and all my car needed was gasket seals 🤦🏽‍♂️
mike you should build it with gt3 kit
Rip the Mercedes
Need to have Damon pick each member up a car, all salvage and rebuild them all to one’s liking with dde on the door like the others l, would be good content I’d like to see.
I would love to see an AMG on the channel ripping up the streets. Green Hell Magno is my favorite OEM paint ever that would be awesome.
You guys should hit up the guy that runs the YouTube channel legit street cars, he is a Mercedes genius
A 454 Big Block!! Imagine that Mercedes camed out, just choppin away lol
Was a bad pcv on my Audi
You guys need to put a inline 5 Sportquattro engine into something, that sound is just amazing!
Here you go guys have a free death trap on me & try not to kill yourself in the process 😂😮😊😅
the number plate is so ironic
Sounds like it Needs a GT3 kit and a JUDD and have  a DDE Bentley/Merc off
I am getting ready to get a Mercedes Gt R.  Great cars.
Look around I found the engine for one of those cars for $4,500
check the ignition wire the mouse probably chewed through it.
A four rotor turbo would be sick in that Mercedes and do a custom wiring harness to avoid any Mercedes electrical issues 🤙🏻 Dorito power🤠🛞💨
Just put 458 motor and manual swap it with hydro.... That would be insane 😂
Seems like there's more than enough work already - while this made for an interesting video, not sure if it's worth the time/effort/$$$ to rebuild.  Any update on the SVJ transmission issues?
Marc should buy that merc of that guy an fit in an LT4 motor 😍
Mike those back light look good tinted black lol
LS swap that thing
All a good clean sand the taillight all good
4 Rotor
What’s the dealio martilio boy Josh Laurent is putting a hellcat engine in his.
Strip that GT and throw in something simple!! The body lines alone on that car are sexy asf ... It's a beautiful looking car, but all of those electrical issues and 47 recalls don't sound very good.. the new GTRs are sooooo sick..  But way too much for what they are ..
dde is click bait number 1.lol been noticing it loads recently
That tow truck driver is an idiot always have skis on you and one of the best things for locked up cars is a bottle of dish soap on the tires and tow truck bed. How do i know this i used to drive tow truck
well I guess Jerry doesn't seem did funny now, does he?
I keep yelling at Mike to check the oil before he tries to start it. To see if there is oil in it or coolant in it mixed.
Would be crazy if Michael Merling was watching now!
It WAS 100K until the tow guy got ahold of it.
gotta love being so rich you get a 200k car and youre "not a car guy" and just let the dash lights rip....and let it sit.... sheeeeesh
LS swap it it's what 99.9% of the population would do.... Lol I think it would be hilarious with the beemer motor smoking the tires off of it sliding around but you got to keep that plate...
A jz would he sweet
Just put an LS in
You guys need to get mikes go-carts or some golf carts to get anywhere in your shop 😂
Mike needs to buy this for 10k and make a new Daily over his Porche. Im with Tim quad Rotor that BIATCH!
Watching from Sydney Australia
Put the M5 V8 in the benz😂❤🔥
AMG with 22K miles, seems like the original owner should have had a warranty, no?
I guessed sls from the thumbnail silhouette.  I am a sad lol xx
cant beat bmw join them 😂 mercedes with bmw engine would be insane
M120 V-12 CORVETTE TRANSAXLE. ITS AMG ITS PAGANI. V12 DDE....   PERFECTION
I don't like JZ's it's like hellcats these kids now a days think hellcats are the best car in the world. Also majority of the kids that buy a hellcat they crash them. I actually enjoy watching 1 hellcat totaled at a time. I just hope the person's in the car survived. We had a guy that drove his hellcat 130mpg and hit a power pole. The engine flew out of the car 40 yards from where the car was sitting. For the ones that do t believe that look up charger crash on central ave Albany NY and check it out for yourself. The guy survived because he was so drunk
Take that Merc and drop in a JUDD Motor !! @Mike lets go !!
Never check the intake line to make sure there is not mice junk in it. Sucks all of it in the motor and in end does need a new motor
This gotta be a build on the main channel aswell
Yooo Mike is in love with bad ideas haha let's just swap the damn engine. RWD manual LS swap LETS GOOO
Trans fluid in the SVJ might needs to be checked. Hopefully the clutches are fine. Cause it’s kinda acting like a domestic vehicle when the trans gets to temp it doesn’t pull but with the Lamborghini it won’t go into gear. I hope the SVJ makes a speedy recovery. Keep up the great job Fellas I’m faithfully tuned in
Make it a drift car with a pneumatic sequential connected to the stock paddles
Probably poped a head gasket
I drive willow springs on gt7 does that could lol
You guys should get electric scooters or something to get through the new home 😂
I was wondering what was hiding under the tarp near the F12 in some of the other videos this week.... I think I can stop wondering now 🤣
Put a hellcat motor in 😊
Looks like DDE has their first CRAZY CUSTOMER BUILD!!!! Super wide body, big wing, big power and FLAMES!!!
Just a thought,  bring over Alex from Legitstreetcars for an Amg collaboration.  Hes an ex amg tech and would probably love to rip on the block.
I hope Mike keeps it
I’m calling it now.. HYDRO LOOKED ENGINE……😢😢😢
That mercs crying out for a V10 Judd engine 👌🏼
You could for sure get a GT3 body kit for that beauty
Just call the dealer ask what was wrong they will have history and technician notes
This car should be a project for the boys Mark, Mike, Tim and Sean’s car
I think this Merc needs a 1500 HP Japanese  turbo diesel
Could be a money pit Mike…but it does have potential.
Walk away from that . Sooo many builds on your plate.  You know Damon has 3 he hasn't even mentioned yet. Lol
Wow, I’m excited for this one. This is my dream car
Audi v8 twin turbo all wheel drive mercedes coupe
A supercharged  corvette motor it needs  🥹
Buy it 6.3 new engine sorted😊
I watched this old timer take repell bug spray put it on the lights wait then wipe off and looked cleaner then new try the taillights what would it hurt?
Lt4
Sean just loves killing power steering pumps😂
Let’s go mike
Your jump packs probably would work. Most packs in default mode, will try to sense a voltage on the battery.  If the battery is dead and does not have the required voltage, it won't work.  Most packs have a key sequence to override the check and jump the car.
Swap a UHAUL engine into it...........Add some Eagles to that EuroWreck
Damon should buy it for Mike so he can fix it and go for drives with the guys
GREAT CONTENT. AMG GT ON THE CHANNEL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯🤯🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😍😍😍😍👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
This where Josh Laurent comes in he has the engine for that car if I'm not mistaken 💯💪
Tesla plaid swap it like Kyle on the boosted Boys channel. Definitely should tesla swap the caravan GT ultimate sleeper!
Love even just episodes like this
Gut the car, build it next to the F12....keep the interior but add roll cage....angle kit, v8/12, all new wiring, trans...exhaust...gift to Mark or Sean......
Hey Mike I think you need to put a Steve Morris SMX motor hi Reven  👍😁  Charlie Western PA
those supposedly have a transmission bypass switch . ( To put it into neutral)!
Contact Legit Street Cars for a collaboration, he’s a certified Mercedes tech
Put a coyote in it
Oh I hope and pray that this was all part of a planned Gumball 3000 style rally build for Mike Essa. If they can keep the interior stock and swap the engine for a 1000hp beast and a widebody kit, Mike can roll with Damon and Dave. The Senna, the Bentley and the AMG GT all in DDE liveries would be amazing.
"my friend isnt to car savvy, warning light comes on he's like...meh"....thats Dave isnt it?? lol
Just toss an ls7 in it and a supercharger, make an easy 700whp
DDE should get a lightly crashed C8 then put a Lamborghini engine in it you see everyone putting Ls engines in a Lamborghini why not do a C8 swopped V10 or V12 be sick to show up with a C8 sounds like a Lamborghini lol
LET DAMON COME UP WITH A BUILD IDEA FOR THIS CAR.  THIS IS ONE OF MY FAV CARS...add tht sweet sounding Ferrari v8 or v12....🙏🏿 what a fund build. Something different.  You got nothing but time.
Stories channel is turning into 2JZ swap channel 😊
Thinking if it has an air to water intercooler, if it’s failed internally would cause that mixture and possible hydro lock
Really piss off the Germans it’s time to LS swap it with a blower!
Stealerships will get you every time service is their main bread and butter!
Please teach Mark to build cars using this AMG!!!!! V8 or v12 Ferrari engine...
It needs a Rotary
Sounds like a great  new car too add too fleet
Damon buy this thing for mike.  Would make a sick drift car and a sick dde livery.  Probably be one of the cheaper builds vs content
Pretty sure the air bag is a takata air bag? Because the air bag problem was one that effected many manufacturers, from hyundai to mercedez.
ADD THIS TO THE DDE FAMILY.  WE TAKE ALL EXOTICS THT NEED HELP 😂😂😂
Mike Essa reminds me a lot of Ken Block. From wearing hats to the drifting to the similar appearance.
LS all day. Make your life easy and beat the hell out of everything else on the road for a fraction of the price.
Damon and Dave should sponsor the build for Mike ! Pull the motor rebuild it to 800-1000 hp and clean the exterior up and maybe do some body kit ( dare I say the gt3 kit ) ?
This Benz has the worst transmissions  they always break.  Swap it out
Hope the owner pays mike a pretty penny to work what seems like a miracle to get it back working😊
Get a BMW M57 diesel in it, you can make power and get a lot of people freaking out 😂😂😂
Twin turbo Texas speed 427 with a c7 trans axle, a.k.a. leroy the savage from cleetus mcfarland
Id like to see this converted into an sls style body with the silver body, wing on the back, and some nice wheels. Would be dope imo
Put some Polyurethane on the tail and headlights😊
Mike needs that merc s54 swap would be wild but what would be even better is a Barra swap 6-700hp un opened but with a forged motor built heads bigger turbo injectors higher flow fuel pump ect.. can get 12-1300hp super reliably only down side to Barras are they are heavy got cast iron blocks aluminium heads big engines 4l straight 6 but man they sound good Adam lz has a Barra in his mustang and he loves it putting a barra in that merc would trigger so many people cuz they wouldn’t have any idea what it is and get gapped by a ford powered Mercedes
is that the same engine as in the Bentley?
13:20 lool tim is funny
Mikeeeee get the car🤌🏽
if you give that gtc/gts some love it wil slide and drift like a mad machine and be hella quickkk and it sound like heaven <3 . <3
Where is Mikes first supercar?????  He said a client asked him to look at this Mercedes for him.  And thats not a super car anyway.  I really hate how this channel always trys to click bait people.   Hope Dave the swindler isn't up to his old tricks again.
Holy crap easily would have slid off with some dish soap😂 hopefully transmission isn't hurt now
Yes Mike your wife eventually will be on board building the AMG. It may take a few years just remember diamonds are a girl’s best friend 😂
I think the gearbox have left the chat pulling it down off the trailer like that 😢
OMG that hurts!!!!!!!
Imagine just having the money just to have that sitting outside for 3 years and not really care
you should put a boeing in the car instead and have it be a drag car
Corvette swap
26:42❤🎉 Go for a big block 672 with the blower. Sticking out the hood with big meats underneath the back. I know that's not the way the channel is normally goes but could you imagine😂
Forget the engine 4:03 now Tranny!!!!!         Could Be a Fun Tire Slayer Thoooo Sean Says Ready for A JZ!!!!!!!
Ls swap big turbo
🇵🇭
Get that piece of junk off DDE'S property. You still need to finish your wife's Vette.Time is money.F12,Damon's 599, you have a lot on your plate!
Towing fella could’ve put the car on rollers and winch it off slowly but chose chaos instead 🤦‍♂️ 😅
why does marc say anything he dont know anything about cars at all...... tell him to keep to the videos nothing more
May you guys rebuild it 😢
Mike neededs a full build after the f12 and Bentley is done
1000hp+ vr6
Turbo diesel that amg&roal coal in CA
The car is meh. Its the vermin that has chewed everything and by looking at the dash, do you really want to do all that when you have your Porsche to finish.  Can't wait for all the lifts n stuff to be installed so we can witness greatness at DDE.
New drift car build
ADD THIS TO THE DDE FAMILY.  PLEASEEEEEE!!!!!! GIVE IT TO MARK
Those that didn't know now? Always known/seen him before...Mike was always underrated and a legend in the car community 🙌 ❤!
V12 FERRARI OR LAMBO ENGINE.  OR V8 FERRARI. Make it a manual.
Dam that would be a awsome project car
DDE should try to buy this beast and build it up!!!  Sorry, but that is a neglect by a bad owner.
Just pull the engine and trans and swap it out with LS
Dde must buy it or else  Mike  For sureeeeee  It must be on the channel
See if any of the working parts can go on Tim’s car. 😂
BUY THE CAR OFF HIM DAMON.  NEW ENGINE.  GIVE TO MARK OR SEAN.   DRIFT IT.
I bet them mice chewed through the wires, which is causing a no start
Need some dishsoap to get that car off the flat bed.
Would honestly be hilarious with a b or a k in it I hate to say it I wouldn't even be mad if a ls ended up in it
it would be sick if Mike could buy it and LS swap it, that would cost way less and still be a V8
Mike you should Americanize the soul in the AMG yes yes 👍 👍👍
Liquid soap under the tires and it will slide right off the rollback.
rotary swap it is
Damn ,that shop's legit FAAAKENN YUUUGEEE!! 29:08
Why did you buy this heap of junk? Absolutely garbage
I’ve been asking for a while on doing a AMG GT build on the channel
I know Mike is a drift guy, but going full drag race mode with this would be sick! Throw a big block or a HEMI in it with a 671 blower 😁💨💨
It’s sick lol 5k, fun new drift car
Send us the tail lights 😇😇👌@mt_custom_lights
TX Speed LSX swap it and twin turbos!
Oh we need to see this with strait pipes and flames..
Who tf buys a car n just leave it for a year😂
Wake up and DDE is uploaded - coffee and the boys 🎉🎉
At least the dealer's diagnostic of "needs new engine" wasn't a lie 😅 But charging 1300 dollars for that is crazy.
Boy Guys , Y'all have ALOT OF PROJECTS!! And , only 1 ESSA! LOL WHATS UP ESSAY
Like Shawn said use a k20 head k24 block with the s2000 trans kit you can make it rwd and that will really piss of the Mercedes enthusiast or just use a built k24 so you don’t have to deal with looking for k20 head
I’m with Sean, drop a 2J in the Merc
Hey Mike, ever thought about a 928 manual? They are boats but would sounds sick straight piped.
Ls swap it
Mike, Aston Martin has fitted a manual gearbox to this engine in the Vantage. So get a new engine and the manual gearbox. Could theoretically be the first AMG GT with a manual gearbox. The engine has a lot of potential for tuning. Then add the AMG GTR body kit and you have a crazy car
That thing looks like it was flooded
You should buy it Mike and put a McLaren engine in it and it would be a modern SLS AMG💯
Lmfao "That doesn't make it go any faster?" Had me dead
There should be a manual release for the transmission to get it out of park
Bring back the Essay logo its sooooooo rat
I like this. It will be interesting to see if it *actually* needs a new engine, or if they just wanted to get more work and let others cover the cost.
Comical watching bmw guys banging on a MB and talking about reliability. 😂😂😂 Let’s swap it to bmw problems
Gm ☄️
New engine and now gearbox needed then 😳
I would love to have Mike make a crazy build on that mercedes! put a darn lambo engine in 😂
keep the mercedes v8 and do built engine!
Generally rats or mice will chew wires and hoses up.  With so many of them in the car it could have gotten to any number of them.  The phone made it sound like Dave owns the car.
Ive raced at Laguna Seca a couple times times just not in cars. Motocross and mountain bikes.
As a tow truck driver I just want to say that tow guy did his job not really much you can do with a locked up car on the bed but shake it off .. I would’ve used some soapy water on the back tires thou to make it smoother
I have this almost same spec AMG GTS. Its a beautiful driving and looking car.
Note to self. When a car doesn't start, check the fuel first. You'll save a lot of pain that way
@5:58 bro I’m all for swapping something cool into this car or any car that needs a cool motor in it BUT this car already has an amazing motor in it. I think if it needs a new one just swap same back into it. These are great cars with great motors that sound amazing. So no swaps let’s just fix it and make it crazy.
As Soon as I seen that car I hit the like, my favorite car by a long shot. Sls Ams Gt🙌 black edition
It’s okay Sean, my hood struts are blown out on my 4.7 too 😂
It has ate through the water to air intercooler and they have the takata airbag the will kill you if it goes off and they have fix it by law
Time for them Bugatti scooters. Need quicker /easier way to get around the block.
Thanks for giving mike a new supercar. 🎉 Make it a drift in the block in the next video. 😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Put a hellcat or ls swap it or put a demon 170 hellcat create motor plus you can get a wiring harness for it
Before swapping engine see it can be fixed and add more power and a flame tune it would be Mike's DDE car
Bug spray the merc taillights❤️
Mike deserves every bit of it
LS Swap it and call it a day😂
DDE💪💪💪💯💯💯💯💯
V10 huracan motor is the only choose…..
Lol this thumbnail is making me feel all types of emotions
Just buy a flare plane crank v8 and pro charge it to throw it in there, still get the “exotic” sound and a pro charger with a good blow off valve would sound amazing
man I hope that dealership slip was from a while back.  Otherwise $1,300 to tell your ish is broke and not even vacuum out the rat nest right on top.. criminal
Texas speed LS
Nah, LS swap it lol
Kswap the world! K20 Turbo 😂
Damn, Mike and his knowledge of engines! I don't know anymore better for a diabolical project like this throwing in an S54 from an M3 that pushes 1000HP! Well deserved! It's time you got a new "to you" tire slayer to roll with the DDE crew! 😎🤙🏼 Since you're gonna modify it, I suggest reaching out to Carbonerre and use that DDE magic to collab with them and promote their "GT3 Widebody" Kit. It'll change the look of the lines for sure. Reach out to Adrian at AL13 for some dope rims and have PFS wrap it in the Mercedes F1 Safety Car livery but DDE style and put on an amber light bar on the roof like Eric's E46 M3 wagon! 👀
Engine swap to M156 or M159...
Mercedez Zonda v12 swap
Put a BMW S85 5.0 v10 too it mike!!!
Looks like a Job for Mat Armstrong 😅😅😅😅😅
Black Series kit will go straight on aswell 😂
So, why this engine cannot be rebuit, like you change everything in it, on it and repolish it inside and tadaam.
Thats not from a leak... thats a hole in the cilinder and or block.. that engine is toast
Yes Mike, please bring MERCEDES to DDE. Especially this one.
B16 in a AMG GT 🤣🤣🤣 Someone Needs To Slap Shaun 😐😅
Sooo, that's what you have under the red car cover🤣😂🤣😂
Damon, Dave.. get a hold of Wilderdog and gent a collar and leash set for you guys. Proceeds go to no kill shelters. It's exactly who you guys are and they would be vapor as soon as they launched
You need this mike, its your dde car
August has a Blue Ely LP640 Murci GATED manual for a million dollars.  BTW.
Throw a Ferrari engine in that thang!!! 😂😅
Lol, if Mike takes it, he should build it back to new... the only thing with swapping engines is you will have to rewire the car and lose everything that makes it a cool car... and it would be more than the price of a new one. You should see if you can get a good donor car with a side impact.... and make a good car!
I know an English man and his dad who's good at this kinda thing
Yo that car needs a 2j swap for sure.
if you are saying the pison rods is bend then you wont get the engine to turn over just stip it down
That is a beautiful car
This car needs to become Mike's rally car
Mercedes does that a lot even if it doesn't an engine. My mom had to get an oil change so she went to the dealer and they told her she needed a whole new engine. Those asshole told her her engine was cracked and won't run because it's ruined. Good thing my mom called my sister and my sister raised hell at the dealer and turns out my mom's engine wasn't cracked  and they were lying. My mom did get a free oil change though....
Strip out the engine and anything else which is weight and attach a skirt to the underneath and make it into a hovercraft.  Drifting on Blockness.
You def. Need another headache
D16 AMG GTS 😂😂😂
Pumped for what mikes going to do to the Merc. I’m sure Damien and Dave can help out 😂🤣
bruh i wish alex from legitstreets cars would do a collab yall would get along great fr i can see mike and alex bonding over cars alot
Spray some WD40 on the ground and pull it off with the H1 lol
Lol i guess the clickbait fooled everyone. Nobody realizes MIKE DIDNT BUY THIS. HES LOOKING AT FIXING IT FOR HIS FRIEND. People just don't pay attention
One project at a time fellas.
Texas speed in that mercadies. Ls swap
Sean is quickly becoming my favorite on the channel. He keeps pushing the 2JZ idea lmao. All us is300 owners are on the same wavelength 😂 And his reaction to the recalls at 16:56 is priceless
do c63 v8 swap
I wonder how well that Mercedes would drift since it’s smaller looks like the engine could be pushed behind the front wheels and its rwd. Would sound awesome. I’m never gonna be in the market for anything like that but those amg v8s sound nasty🫶  Blame it on brain damage thanks taliban  Also fml  Also also of course there ain’t no engine behind the rear wheels look at that sexy little ass
I hope that wrecker company has good liability insurance.... Y'all should have put the dollies under the rear wheels on the flatbed.
Builds on builds
bruddddahhhhhhssss, get a jack and put it under the diff with some one inside on the brakes next time dont shimmy that badboi off hahhahjaha
LS swap it! Make all those Mercedes problems go away! 😂
Hellcat motor
Toyota GZ V12 Swap would be sick!!!
Its an exotic Afterall so main channel 😄🤞
LS swap the car...  Cheaper fun and a lot of scope for tuning
Tow truck driver doesn't have a bottle of oil to squirt under the tires to slide it? Not a good tow truck driver!
Get it out of the building
Mike is a fcking mad scientist 😂 please drop a s55 M motor in there
just buy a rear damage or rear burnt dono car and swap all out 😂 be a cool car for mike he needs and upgrade to hes car
What sort of transporter is he id be sending him a bill for tge box
Cheese n rice that tow truck driver didn't give a fuhhhh. Holy shit
Rb26 swapped amg gt?????? Yes please
How much money does one have to just leave an AMG GT in your driveway after you move?
LS swap it!!!
bmw powered drift MONSTR Give the tire slayer some comp!!!!!!
VR38DETT  Swap it
Perfect project car for the new DDEHQ
This car needs 1jz v12 FE
Lot of work to rebuild it. Might as well just buy another used AMG.
Tow truck drivers don’t give a f*<k
2jz swap it. Lol.
Always loved the way this Mercedes looked, specially in person, congrats Mike!
U should put a 24 valve Cummins in it
Wow, I can’t believe somebody would treat a GT-R like that.  Peasants like me can’t understand the things rich people do
Damn rich people just leave a 100k car sitting and rotting. This car if clean is still a 75-80k car. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I would like to see mike fix this car back right and keep it
There is an emergency neutral release, WTF!!
Wow, if that’s how he got the car off in front of you, imagine how he got it on the truck… Why would you not stop him. That box and diff will be pretty fucked up!
hope you washed your hands after touching that engine bay, rats be having mad diseases.
Mark needs that car
That gt  would be a great drift car 😂
Ain't got no gas in it 😂😂😂😂 I'm the only one that caught the slingblade reference
Mike? A drift Mercedes?
13:11 I thought they were at an airport for a sec 🤣
it'll be interesting to see mikes choice of engine swap if he decided to do it
RB
Hey Mike's milkshake brings all the boys to the block LOL😂
Poor Mike has a bad habit, lol. What's one more project?
That’s some skill with that trailer
Get some electric transportation for inside the shop could be helpful
Make them want toy
I’m assuming it’s the same guy that got Mike to build that crazy C63 when Mike was showing his shop? Dudes a die hard AMG guy respect
Does that 4runner have a powersteering problem also?! Lol damn sean
Looks like what's going on with Josh's AMG too...😩
I'm usually  not talking but I'll give it to dde ... make them want you!!! Whomever they are
Looks like many have been clickbaited😂
Lmaoo " ain't got nooo gas ⛽ in it" I about died 😂💀
Just say sorry Damon and put the twin turbos f12 motor in it
It grabs my attention how Damon and Dave figured out that !!!! I love the concept and content but they learned it's the personality.....f the content it's transition to life it's always been about the sellabity
Finally a merc on the channel!!!!
Where is UV?
Could be a cracked head or bad oil cooler
tim Said it! 4 rotor gods have spoken
How brutal, you guys just have to sit and watch the driver slamming levers to get the car off
YES A MERCEDES!!!
1 or 2jz it. Or wanna do something crazy k swap it. 🤔
You guys should get them electric Bugatti scooters to get around the shop
this car need a carbonerre kit with the wing !! insane mike
Buy it mike and put in a built twin turbo ford Monde 2004 v6 or the bmw inline 6  or hear me a Subaru ez30r flat 6 with twjn turbos basically a co Porsche designed motor with a Corvette trans axle would be sick and would piss of so many people
That car is so nice
another new car... repeated content smh again smh
By the thumbnail, it looks like an AMG GT
Check the oil cooler
Malaysia 🇲🇾✅
They didn't use those stupid bio degradable wiring harnesses in those, did they? I know merc did that at a point, and they had to swap harnesses on warranty.
Essa....tireslayer cocky and still is but gives respect for who came before
This Mercedes with a manual swap would be WILD
Keep the 4.0l. No silly JDM stuff.
Before attempting to fix it, you guys should pressure wash it as vacuum clean the interior. Let's hope the new compound doesn't get a Ratatouille infestation.
Shouts to dde especially for parenting and taking on parent
Audit the audit needs a shout from you!
Tim was on to something  4rotor amg gt 🔥
fuck yes Mike. been waiting for some quality benz content 🎉🎉🎉
Get a couple shop golf carts or small UTVs to move and pull stuff around.
Thing didn’t have oil it had milk in it
It boosts your popularity but it does it because it show your honesty in wanting to learn....most ppl say they want to and most never follow through
Gotta see Mike on a gumball or something in that gt 👌🏼
You have to stick the key in
As a former tow truck driver,that is NOT the way to get that Benz off the bed 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ I guarantee that he also drug the shit out of it up the bed and didn’t use skates . Smh on this dude for sure
Marks been at DDE for how many years and still doesn't know squat about cars..... when that Merc is running, it makes a sweet sweet sound. The only thing underwhelming is Marks comments.
@superbikemike
Mark you an inspiration always keep asking questions
I hope u guys build such a powerful engine for this AMG such that it needs a headlight intake ☠☠☠☠☠☠
Lets Go . AMG Build
💎👌👌👌💎💪🔥💯 pre sure DDE has become a worldwide brand these days 💪💪 killin it 👌🔥
The only sad thing about how that car arrived is how you guys unloaded it, totally insane how “certified” people treat these cars😂😂😭
We had a tree come through the shop and destroy a amg gtr pro this morning
Ls swap or a hellcat
It's 10PM in Malaysia 🇲🇾🇲🇾 and the best timing to watch a DDE updates. Looking forward for a lot more build now that Mike The Drift Champion Essa is moving in with more awesome tools.
Legit Street Cars is your guy to speak to he has YouTube channel he know Mercedes very well.🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇺🇲👌
I loved those AMG GTs, I am 6'6 but could drive them no problem. I had my hands on the GTC, GTS, GTR, GTR Pro and Black Series. Love them all as long is it wasnt a convertible.
Those v8 tt known to hydro lock stuck injector
I love those AMG’s
Damn this joke I sucks if you to put some kind of oil on the bed it would just
Nice dde
Mercedes, sat outside in the weather for years, doesn't run , transmission locked up. Still better than the Senna
The AMG needs a GT body kit
My suggestion with the Shop. Get like 20 race simulators and have a Tournament twice a month.
This car ready for a matt Armstrong
Mike teach me how to drift lol
Congratulations mike you deserve it
Let me guess he bought a Porsche
3:25 very interesting way to get the car off the tow truck lol I am now curios to how they loaded it up
Damn that towie needs to be sacked. There are skids towies bash under thetyres so the car will slide without damaging anything
100% rat damage to the engine harness!!! You got this mike!! When u fix it do you get to keep it???
People do understand this isn’t Mikes car, right?  He’s looking into what it needs to run again for a customer of his.
Im with Tim! collab to Rob Dahm and get a rotary in here
Let me widebody it
What video is next?  The river of rain video………
Hey guys, a bit off topic but I wanted to bring to your attention that “Audit the audit” made a video on the incident you guys had with officer Torres from Costa Mesa in the Murcielago traffic stop. He goes over the law and it gives you a better understanding of the laws, treaty (treaty supersedes state rights), rights you guys had that the officer had violated. Since you guys were asking questions on the legality of the exhausts and such. Essentially summing up that you guys would have won in the courts eyes if you fought it. Anyways much love and excited to see todays daily video ❤🔥
Put some soap on that bed, damn.
I’m so happy for mike
Dave's salary is now in the negatives
congratulations mike ❤
Get that man a GT3 kit for his new car!
Good morning beautiful people
Mike get a v10 m6 or m5, you know how to work on these 😁 and maybe TT it or swap it in the bmw i8🤔 * just a suggestion*
Damnnn Mike getting paid those big bucks
Awesome car Mike, hope the repairs are cheap. This is one of my favourite cars 🔥🔥🔥
The 3 stooges are going to kill it in 2024!!
Why is Mark so dumb? Mike literally just said "so I'm going to take a look at it and see what's wrong with it" seconds later Mark asks "do you know what's wrong with it right now?".......
I GOTTA STUDY FOR MY TEST TMR
Damn moving from Commiefornia to New York? Not very bright 😂
Coffee and DDE  bast part of the morning SORRY BUT IT'S NOT STARBUCKS
