Xbox slogan is "WHOMP" 🤣
They did not make a good decision since OG XBOX
Playstation guy is funny, good skit.
Xbox slogan is now "This is an Xbox". Xbox slogan was "Jump in".
Xbox shrugging his shoulders is truth! 😂
Every company needs a CEO like Mark. Enough with this polite and professional stuff.
i haven't seen bro's anime house 6 man leland been eating good lol
Make for new steam machine
Microsoft having no confidence in the Xbox brand anymore is too accurate
Orochimaru Leland is goated lol
Nintendo faking them numbers like a democrat election
Sony slogan is the definition of toxic against Microsoft 😂😂 because Xbox really don’t have a slogan
Play Stay Shaawn. Impressive.
They mad lol
Bens face 😂😂😂😂
pretty sure lots of people would buy a PSP ish kind of console if PS "allow" people to do what they want
Next Time!!!
and they are in fact re releasing Halo CE xDD
They really gave nintendo money for a skit... shame.
They gon need a new video after Shiggy just dropped 10 mil in 4 months
Adelle lol
Acting is hard
Why is PlayStation the crazy one tho?
I love you guys Keep on making shit
Halo going to PlayStation 😂😂😂
“Man these Xbox 🥷 soft asf yall gotta get some heart”
1:40  Playstation: Re-release Halo? X-box: It's going to be on your console too.
Idt it's done much since... it beat the Super NES?
Dope
The Nintendo ninjas scary af, Etika taught me that
Need a video on switch buyers remorse
bruh 😭😭
Aye GTFO Xbox back for we slide 😂😂
REALLY funny. My goodness...
😂that’s funny
😂😂😂😂
"Xbox"😭
Who they think they is Adele lol 😂
Nintendo came before PlayStation and Xbox.
That’s a switch 3 😂😂😂
Steam Deck 💪💪
The key cards did the killing for you 😂.
How didn't you see them underworld dudes, N's right THERE 😂🤣😭💀
"Playstatïøœn" 🤌
And after that, no sold a single one lol
who they think they is Adele? LMFAO
If you're gonna spend that kind of money on a switch, you might as well become a pc gamer with a handheld. You'll make your money back in a few months. There is a steam sale every few months, with constant rotating sales in between. You can get most games for 15-20 dollars, and AAA for 35-40 within the year most of the time.  Realistically, unless you're only buying the newest games, you can get at least 4 games to every game you can buy from Nintendo   I support games I like with all the extra money I have now so all the price slashes do is make the market more competitive towards better games
1:50 I predict Desmond is Nintendo😂😂😂
I should have seen that switch twist coming, but those dudes looked underworld as hell so I trusted them 😭😭
Nintendo are child games ...budget is very less...but they sell the same price as PlayStation
bro 😂😂
How is playstation gonna talk about rereleasing games? They remaking 2yo games lol at least xbox waited 20 years.
Leland should've done the Xbox sound😭
That's how black people do buisness for real that's why we need white cops
Thye look like demons! LMAO
Barely 3 months ago an switch 2 sales are way down 😂😂 they should have a follow up skit 😂😂
Why Ben stranding like that? 😂

PLAYYTAAYCHON GOT ME😂   Edit:SWITCHES GOT ME
Xbox really hasn’t made a good decision since 360
Yall Niggas Better Get Some Heart 😂 😂 😂 😂
2:08 😂😂😂😂😂
1:27 they had 1 chance for an extremely unique game that could have been the best console seller ever. I am still extremely salty about them canceling scalebound
I'm proudly Xbox all day...and yeah! I'd gladly side with Playstation over this...Nintendo...anyway! Nintendo hasn't made a good decision since the 64. The cube was alright, but anything after that? Pure garbage. They went from having games like Turok on the 64, to having child games. It's a disgrace
WHO THEY THINK ? ADELE!?
That’s a switch 3 🤣🤣
1:38 the way he looks into the camera when he said that 😂😂😂😂😂
Well...Nintendo already killing itself sooooo, problem solved?
nah the halo and saved saves Xbox no cap

Pley - sta  - shon. he hit the right octave on that, then went off key with Ex -BOX
The ps5 was sold out literally everywhere for 3-4yrs straight even the pre-orders were sold out at tht time 😂😂😂.....I think u mean Xbox never did numbers like tht smh the Nintendo really isnt a threat to Playstation but Xbox is a different story lol
When Desmond said “I got my switch on me right now” he really did have a switch on him😂
0:21 😂😂😂😂😂
When they gonna mention my boy steam deck

“What you gonna do” head side to side “re release gear of wars”

xbox aint got no slogan lmao
Hilarious!
Playstashaan😂
Nintendo has ninjas everywhere!
Handheld devices is where it’s at Nintendo has been on handheld devices since I was a kid.. Games on the go whenever in my opinion beats gaming at home.. ever since handheld consoles first came out years ago has shown that
microsoft don't even do consoles no more. Its all game pass. They don't even do games no more either, every company they buy just goes under like MS got no game bro.
Idk what this is but i liked it
“What’s yall slogan? 🤷🏾‍♂️” 😂😂😂
IT'S AMAZING PLAY - STA - SHUN!😂🤣 These guys are wayy too creative
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
fucking great
Fastest... Lol 😂
The black stereotypes are cringe.
You ain't made a good decision since xbox 360... 😂😂😂 Truth
Xbox mannerisms made me die of laughter 😹😹
Cheaper than an Iphone
Who’s here after Sony’s announcement of raising PS5 prices
Grinding for years how many PlayStation 5 games did they made when ps5 released?
Love that this came back up in my recommended cause somehow I missed it. "We been grinding for years n****! Play stay on."
I got my switch on me right now!!! 🤣😂🤣😂
Thats the switch 3! Looool
The switch 3 was actually a bar
You see the world is so gay that sometimes I just want to hide behind my girlfriend when I'm in public and cuddle up I'm going to let you know how that feels
Idk why people buy that garbage system.
“EXBAWKS” 😂😂😂😂
I don’t understand why everyone likes nintendo
Lmfao what is Xbox slogan though?!
😂
OH SHIT.
Funniest thing about this is that Microsoft and Sony are now linking up for real.
Mark looking good for a 76 year old
we are not in a recession, that was with BIDEN
“You ain’t made a good decision since 360” I fkin heard that!
I see cris tucker.  Who shares my view
They actin skills crazy 😂
Switch 2 needs to fail. Nintendo became hellla greedy as hell. They are bricking switch 2 left and right.
PlayStation they cops 😂
After gamescom this hit different.
ANIIIIIIMEEEEEEEEEEE HOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUSSSSEEEE I BEEN WAITING FOR THT MF TO DROP KEEP THE SAME PLOT PLEASE... And if the Rimiru I seen
The plot twist surprised me.
Once PS6 comes out and it is actually a valid upgrade, Switch 2 sales will be stomped.   Switch 2 had good day one sales but will drop because of their shenanigans. PS6 will continue to sell.
0:55
I feel like Mark acts too hard sometimes, like chill, feel the role out. He might be a better director than an actual actor
“This is an Xbox” while pointing to everything but an Xbox is their new slogan I believe. And I do not know 24 ppl either.😅
Xbox slogan shrug killed me. 🤣
"PLAYSTAYSHAWN" 😂
Leland got chunky
Back door deals
Nintendo was out way before PlayStation and Xbox but still funny skit though
I mean I would agree but Nintendo was out there making board games and puzzles before the NES. They like the Pegasus of video games PlayStation more like Kaiba
yessssss...new anime cominggggggg
Havent made a good decision since 360 I FELT THAT
I can say with confidence its the parents ppl stuggling with groceries coming into the store and selling out the console every time we get any stock in no waiting and its always parents yeah alot of older nerds but an overwhelming amount of angry parents I know cant afford it based on they weekly spending on groceries shit is so funny these kids are getting everything and parents be confused when they cant go outside
Got set up. Nintendo  running  everything.
“Re release halo” as PlayStation rereleased last of us 15 times
leland look like ben 10
my man said that’s the switch 3
The guy on the left looks like a young Bernie Mac!!
Why ya'll still funny after all these years!!!
I DNT CARE HOW OLD YALL GET KEEP MAKING ANIME HOUSE 😈WE LOVE IT ND APPRECIATE IT ND WE NEED MORE HAHAHAHAAAA
The best of this video is the Anime House announcement 🎉 the rest was hilarious though
This video is a gold mine for phrases. They were cooking with this skit.
"I shoulda trusted my FIRST INSTINCT!" 😂
LMFAOOO I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THEM -- THEY LOOK LIKE DEMONS LMFAOOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅 @1:55
Orochimaru and Brother Muzone are obvious, but who's Mark supposed to be? Is Sailor Mercury coming to Anime House?
Valve is the quiet kid in the back
Microsoft is actually setting themselves up for more success. They don't care about the Xbox anymore, they're buying up whole ass game companies and have their own version of Netflix for video games bringing in more money than before.  If Activision or Bethesda release a new game on multiple consoles they get a huge cut of that instead of sticking to just xbox game sales.
*X BAWX*
😂😂😂😂😂
You aint made a good decision since 360 😂.
Juice the gaming  war edition?
😂
I'm not supposed to say this about someone 20 years younger than me but y'all rocking those wigs at the end there
Should've had valve sitting in the background like just chilling counting money.
Gaming been trash for over a decade..I'll save my money
"This shit corny bro" had me weak lol
Know why? Because it’s only $20 for a year membership to play online for Nintendo. THATS WHY.
This whole vid has me cacklin fr
😂😂😂😂
Ben is the most smirkiest nii bruh I can’t nii got me cryn😭😭🤣 2:08
Ben’s posture at the end💀💀
Good Shit - Superman
I fell when he said “PlayStation” with the accent 😂
The way yall mfs posted up on the couch is funny asf😂
For real though, Nintendo is really overpriced and full of paywalls. Idk why people are burning their money for Nintendo, they sell older games at day one retail price (sometimes add $5-$10 more). Switch 2 is literally almost the same console and it's not even fully backwards compatible with switch 1 games so if you want to play those digital ported switch games they sell you it at a discounted price. If people keep on spending PS and Microsoft are going to start doing the same soon
From the first playstation to the PS5 I've never known Xbox slogan 😂
Marc “Play-Stay-Seannn”
😂😂😂 They from underworld😂😂
I think the reason for the switch 2 being so popular is due to nobody expecting there to be a sequel to the switch
"I don't even know 24 niggas"
Great skit !
They can't miss
the demons hopped on animal crossing at the end
Bro, this video is excellent😂😂😂😂. Thank you guys😂😂😂😂
Adele 😂😂😂
I like how they all pulled out Nintendo Switch’s😂
Playstation always reppin good sales or not. Microbox gotta speak up for them Goldys tho. Still aint as bad as them expensive ass nintendo switch shit tho
"I don't even know 24 ngas!"
What's your slogan? What you going to do rerelease Gears Of War!  Yea we announced that already. Halo, yea we did that already! 😆
Hood Olympics 4 5 6 please
Fye
Now Switch 2 sold 6+ million units in 7 weeks. 😂

it’s nice to be able to buy a console that’s not sold out 9 months of the year
LOOOOOOL
Xbox intro Sound : ZOONNMG 😂😂😂😂
Thats 2360 dollars in that last scene if none of them bought the Switch 2 bundle
"xbohhhx" 😂😂😂
But u set records playstation
Ippi so fine 😍
Saw that plot twist a mile away😂
Comment
“XBOox”😂😂😂😂😂😂
When Mark tried coming up with the Xbox slogan - 💀💀💀
"Triple Platinum in a week?" "Who da fk these nggs think they is" "Adele?"" hahahahha. lmfao🤣🤣🤣
I too am suspicious that Nintendo actually sold these units. Likely at least half of them are to scalpers anyway. Fake sales. Many of those consoles will never be played.
This is pure GOLD, y’all awesome😂😂😂 “That’s Switch 3”
ANIME HOUSE GON BE LIVE
“Yeah you heard that shit before! That’s us!” 😂😂😂😂
PlayStation really got it right with Mark’s reaction😂😂
PlayStation literally a Yn 😂
Naaah the switch up was crazyyyyy but I aint gon lie XBOX ALL DAY IDC IM LOYAL
This has got to be the funniest crew in the world. I bet it's NEVER a dull moment with these guys. 😂😂😂
How do they not break character lol
Nahhhhhh the dialogue on this one was FIREEE 🔥🔥 Lmaooo
Dude literally said he had his Switch on im.
1:14 Jump In.
“That’s a Switch 3 Nigga!” 😭😭😭😂😂
That "sound effect noise" is Xbox slogan
Tbh I feel like the switch 2 didn't sell that many I just don't find it possible people were willing to pay 500$ for TWO new games with one not even being out on release
Y'all killing me with the villain squad in the couch😂
wow the new anime house looks awesome.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do rdc stand for real dope CREATORS
Aye dat “ain’t made a smart decision since 360” line so real 😭
Xbox catching strays 😂 Microsoft get them off ya playa

Playstatioooooooon

There's Nothing Greater than the Power of X.
Past 7am here and this comes up and makes my day hahahaha these boys are forever legends! 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
LOL "we in a recession bitch, look around!" hahaha
"PLUS, playstation ain't never did numbers like that" I see what he did there.
🤣🤣
He hit em' with the Impossible Patties at the end 😂
He a cop 😅
What is the slogaaaan ?
the hell? xbox gave us gamepass, they share their best games, and they makin a console that's essentially an optimized PC for those who can't afford one.
*I don't even know 24 Niggaas*   lmao fucking done
Who tf these ngas think they is? Adele nga!?😂😂
This shit too perfect. Leland built just like Phil Spencer 😂
can yall say that a little bit closer 😂😂😂
1:53 Even in these skits, Meland can't help but skate out on Mark when a situation gets serious 😂 Mark had to stop him from running away 😂
1:15 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 nobody knows, they don't even know themselves
😂😂😂😂😂😂🙂‍↕️
I cant believe that dumb shit sold so well all these console are so clown shoes now, just get a pc.

I bought one and claimed refund 2 days later :D their moto should be "providing PSP 2004 graphics and 90s mechanics since 2017 with zero improvement and still making 'em bucks"  nah, I'm not gonna support this lazy ass-games makers
ANIME HOUSE NEEDS SUKUNA AND GOJO

"Playstay-Shaun!"
xbox finna break nintendos record with their next release, everyone & they mama finna buy the next one
ANIME HOUSE!!!!!
No, Nintendo did *NOT* sale over 3M units to customers, they only sold that many in their initial set of batches to the retailers. And now the retailers are stuck hold the bag because they can't sell the units they bought from Nintendo. And to make matters worse, Nintendo is threatening them with *LEGAL ACTION* for trying to sell below MSRP. That's why the Switch 2 console has been completely nixed from Amazon. Nintendo has become the most hated game company not only by gamers but by the retail businesses that support them.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 triple platinum in a week, what they Adele?
“Playstationn” mark got it😂😂
I don’t know anyone with a Nintendo switch, but somehow it be a top seller ALL THE TIME 🤣

It sold that quantity cause of the hype, not for the functionality, like when we got PS4/5, every console does it To that, add people is stupid and would pay anything for an expensive bullshit just to say "hey, i bought it before X person"
Anime house!!!!

Nintendo always outsold PlayStation & Xbox tho
ANIME HOUSE 7 FINALLYYY

"That's the switch 3." Lmao

Leland: "You know that's not my slogan." Mark: "Y'all got a slogan? What is it?  He doesn't even know. 😅
ANIME HOUSE IS BACKKKKKK
Amazingggg
The "EhX Boohx" got me crying 😭😭
Why nobody is taking about the new anime house announcement  ?
Desmond literally looking around after Mark's, "We in a recession, b**ch. Look around!" is an effective touch🤣
Mark be like : F the big three ,is just big me
"You ain't made a good decision since 360!" - OUCH! 😆😆
Good skit, but the anime house announcement was the highlight here. Cant wait🎉🎉🎉
Apparently X box's slogan is "power your dreams" I aint never heard that in my life 😂😂😂
could've sworn Xbox slogan is "X - Box" 🥀
Are you guys ever gonna make another video game house?

Loool 😂😂😂
0:50 I don’t even know that many… 😂
"You ain't made a good decision since the 360:😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:33 Playstation can't even talk smack because they keep re-releasing The Last of Us, and you bet your entire savings they're re-releasing it for PS6 next year or so 😭
Xbox ain’t got a slogan 😂😂😂😂😂
"...Ain't made a good decision since 360!!.." Savage!! 🤣
The Wii U actually sold out at launch...without racial slurs.
That's because PlayStation especially and Xbox is too darn expensive.  As a mother with a son i biy him a new game system Everytime a new comes out he wants that PlayStation 5 was damn near $1000 that was 2-3 years ago. I will never again my daughters has had 2/3 switches of different colors two oculus's and games multiple times and tablets. That should tell you something. You can buy computer or laptop for waaaay cheaper. What is inside the PlayStation especially since you're playing online and still paying for those games. Is it gold inside?  I really don't get it 😂
2:52 😂😂
THAT'S A SWITCH 3 😭
The last joke when they showed a lot of them playing the Switch 2.. That's a reference to people saying they wasn't getting the console but ended up buying it anyways..
WHY LEAVE ME WITH SUCH A TEASER!!! been waiting on this anime house 7
Playstatshawn lmao 🤣
Strategic marketing after an epidemic.
“Playstationn” 🤣🤣🤣

You gotta watch out. Nintendo has its ninjas everywhere.

2:53 Why is ben standing like my 5 y/o nephew
NEW ANIME HOUSE!
That "Playstation" sent me back through all my life lol
Anime house is back baby
Nintendo came out like DMX in 98
Nintendo is for people who actually like having fun when they play games.  Xbox is for stoner gooners. Playstation is for people who gave up.  Playstation is for people who wanna buy games out the ikea catalog.  Playstation is for people who wanna flex that they own a system that don't have time to play.  Playstation is for people who dont trust their Lil cousin. Playstation is for people who are trying to remember what fun is, but just cant.  Playstation is for people who wanna play like they're young professionals, but they're $12,000 in debt. Playstation is for people who sell the system they bought while its still in the box.  Playstation is for people who never wanna move the left stick right and the right stick left at the same time. I mean seriously, who put two sticks right next to each other? What is this, thumb wrestling?
3:25 y’all wild 😂
If we bring Pokémon, we better be bringing Beyblade
When the prices of new video games go up to around $90 I'm going to blame it on the Nintendo fan-boys
“ I got that switch on me right now !  “ 😂😂😂😂
Oooo this gone be fire
xbox not even knowing its own slogan is accurate LOL
His boys in the back "looking like demons". 😭
2:25 “you said closer?”
The moment he said he got his switch on him I just knew🤣🤣
ANIME HOUSEE🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why mark hair always so crisp😂😂
Yeah well Nintendo has exclusives PlayStation and Xbox’s games mostly can be played on pc. Of course Nintendo is going to outsell them in consoles.
Why woukd anyone buy a switch 2
Saying xbox name in the playstation slogan 💀
Lowkey Xbox about to come up. Nobody seeing their moves.
This is tight!!!😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
lol
Someone tell Ip since his real dad, Dennis Robin, and he needs to focus on rebounds and Defense. He'll do better for ya.Mark your jumper just broke. But you are good at other stuff.
PlA-Stay- Shon..  Hahahahhaa  It do exactly that too
Put. Mark. On. Screen.
I. Love. Yall.
Triple plat in a week ain’t no joke!
The anime house preview at the end!!!!!!!!!  Ninjas done stepped up the special effects
“That’s a Switch 3 nikka” 😂😂😂😂😂
2:56 Bro look at this man Ben San😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anime house coming back yesss now can we get video game house back
It’s the shirt saying “Nintendo Rehabilitation Clinic”😂😭😭😭🔥

I won't lie,i..a need more than 1 episode of anime house..I probably need each episode split into 2 just to make it last lol
Ash can’t die man whoever is fighting him is cooked
" Play-Stay- Shuun"😂😂😂😂😂

1:01 Xboxx
Man let my girl work on y’all wigs man please. Good god them shits look wild 😂

Hold on. Y'all not just gonna drop a Charizard in Anime House and act like it's nothing.
The sound you hear when you turn on the Xbox is their slogan 😂😂😂
Do a Texas chainsaw
2:44 I should’ve trusted my first instinct 😂😂
✌🏽💗😂 my baby used to always play Gears of War and Yay🎉Anime House
“You aint made a good decision since 360” 😂💯
Bro, if mountainhead was about ps, xbox and nintendo, that movie would be so much better 😂
Microsoft can buy both of them, along with Steam if they really wanted to.
The switch does have true console exclusive though, majority of it. You don't see new pokemon or mario games on PC. Playstation most sold game of 2025 - Marvel's Spiderman 2 and Black Myth Wukong, both have PC ports Same thing X-box most sold games also have PC ports. Nintendo switch games have IPs that are true exclusives so people have no choice.
"I don't even know 24 niggas" 😂😂😂
Mark doing that Playstation sign on had me dying. And Leland a trip. I am hyped up for the new anime house
Nice anime house is awesome. Thanks mark
What moron is out there buying the switch 2?
“Idevenk 24 niggas” lmaooo!
When we getting hood avatar 5?
The hood needs that switch 3
Goes to show people Want to buy high and sell low
Why they always got Desmond screamin!? 😭😭
Anime House 7 🤩
Hilarious, love you guys.
lmao they def aint sold all that
Considering there were plenty of switch 2. PS and Xbox tried that nonsense with limited supply to drive up the demand so popo on them.
"I don't even know 24 n*ggas" I lost it LOL my friend group is definitely not 24 big ahah 💀
3:25 Where the hell did they get a real charizard!
“PLAYSTAYITON”
Yall need to make a new video with the power plays Xbox is making all over play station rn
We gon have to wait another 2-3 years for anime house 7 to drop💀💀
When you release enough systems at launch people will buy the system
Ypu just hate Nintendo fans.. 😂😂😂
This was gold
Why he sound like Bishop from juice 😂😂😂😂
Bro I can’t wait for the next AH
God Bless! Love yall comedy! Can't wait for anime house! Let's Go!! 🎉 1 John 5:4-5 KJV ❤ For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
Gears of war is my favorite game ever
Nintendo ninjas are from the underworld
ANIME HOUSE
G I'm done watching ya while smoking done made me lose a lung soon as as that 3min mark hit😂😂😂😂😂😂
What they failed to realize is that Nintendo was in this game before Both of them. For YEARS.
These guys are going places 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not going to lie those are crazy numbers for me to only come across 1 niqqa with it
Funniest shit I seen in a long time
Mark Phillips Ain’t having it!!🤣🤣🤣 not the 360.

“We in a recession b*tch, look around” 😩. 0:41
“X Box” 🤖  petty  1:03 😂😂
3:24 tha Dylan pose was funny ik he got sum to say 😂😂
3:24 tha Dylan pose was funny ik he got sum to say 😂😂
As soon as he said my niggas got switches. I said, “WHAT KINDA SWITCHES!!!!!”😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh this too good 😂😂😂
Anime house?!? I need a date!
gaming is like makeup in a recession, people seek out small comforts
Lol 😂
Talkin to xbox about re-releasing with 10 different versions of last of us is crazy 😂 this skit was mad funny
So 3,5 Million people are stupid as fuck for that actually
Nintendo is trying to kill indie games! Boycott Nintendo!!!!! TEAM PALWORLD!!!!
Leland at the end for Anime House had me cracking up😂😂😂   He really look like somebody Momma😂😂😂
Some sus af shit at the end 🌈
This is what people watch ????LEL
This was good. I loved this. I miss consoles. Since 2013, I've been pc. Steam, GOG, Epic Games, etc.
Man Ippi LOOK like he wit ALL the dumbshxt, 4real! Tappin into his inner Knuckles, I guess! Lol
I always forget Xbox still exists beyond the 360 and I got the newer consoles! 😂
Had the opportunity to say you've been around the block but aint made a good decision since 360.
I love y’all 💯
😂 He killT me with "Pleee Stashuuun"
0:40 "We in a recession bitch, look around, that bitch cost 500usd" 😂😂😂. 1:00 "That's not my slogan" 🤣🤣🤣. 1:30 "You ain't made a good decision since 360" 😂😂. 2:13 "They from the underworld" 🤣🤣🤣. Pure gold. If this decade doesn't end us all we're gonna go in laughter.
I just thank mark Dylan Ben aff John Desmond and Lee for this amazing show they truly has there heart and soul this show thank you rdc you got me through tough times and can’t wait for anime house❤️
Xbox ain’t been shit since after the first one. PlayStation been on bullshit with games that’s the only reason why. PS remaster alllllll the old classics they make billions
Mark ain't 💩 🤣😂😅
And then gears of war is on PlayStation
this wasnt funny at all. u all must just have a strong fanbase to get this many videos for something this un funny
Always love to see an Rdc video
“So what is it”? 🤷‍♂️
This are so bangers my boys......
"Whats your Slogan?" Xbox: -shrugs-
🌎🌎🌎🌎
Aye that Hitman code switch was CRAZY 😂😂😂😂
2:08 Jonathan been putting that work at the gym 💪🏿 😂
This was a hard watch. 👎🏾
PC gaming is so much more convienient and useful than console gaming, I don't understand why anyone still buys playstation and xbox. Switch is understandable because its a portable way to have fun with your friends or family, even in the car.
I could have sworn that was going to be Steam that was being hired to take out Nintendo.
Aint no1 notice that charizard 👀 we about to get another anime house banger 🔥
Nintendo the oldest in the game. Haters gonna hate. 🤣🤣🤣
HOLY SHIT ANIME HOUSE
“I ain’t even see dem “  👁️👄👁️

Line about not even knowing 24 dudes killed me.    I had same reaction when I heard about the new Mario Kart.  That’s a class reunion not a race

Lowkey flexing they all got switch 2s
But does the switch have quick resume.......
switch 2 in its scalp stage. But comparing to ps5 launch, it's far worse. The scalped units are barely selling
2:12 LMFAOOOOOOO
●The Truth is the Bible. I Believe in the REAL Chr1st Yashaya(Christ said Believe on me as the scriptures Have said) Real Christ = kjv revelation 1:14-15 & Daniel 10:6 & 5 , not the false idol j3sus which is Cesare Borgia the picture & the name = hey-zues, zues aka s@ tan. 💠 Christianity is a false doctrine. That Rel1gion dosent follow the bible at all. The synagogue of S@ tan just uses christ & the bible to reel ppl into their cult. Synagogue of S@ tan Christ exposes( kjv revelation 2:9 & rev. 3:9 J 3w-- 1sh ppl✡️)  Example as well.

"you havent made a good decision since the 360" the perfect response to that is "concord"....playstations decisions have also gone down the drain😂
As much as I think Nintendo consoles are overpriced, they are the only consoles I feel like I would like having quality-wise
"you aint made a good decision since 360" is real as fuck
0:02 "yeah yeah that's all there, that's Microsoft money!" Exactly how XBOX stays relevant.
🐐
😂😂😂😂
I bought a refurb xbox1x day after switch 2 release...saved money and can still play all the releases that matter.
Will there ever be more hood avatar
hahahaha
Supersized PSP 😂😂😂😂 That is what the Nintendo Switch looks like
Looking forward to more Anime House! :)
Leland getting swole

Top of the line gents ❤❤
I love how Xbox low key doesn’t really care, and how PlayStation is so passionately driven 😂 I also can’t believe that there was a time in my life that I actually cared about console wars.

Tough
Boy do you know how long I been waiting for this here.
😭😭
“ XBOX “😂😂😂
The way he said "hes an actor" got me 😂
Nah wtf. Y'all got Charizard?!? How much y'all pay for that 😂
Shouldn't have given up all your exclusive content to PC Sony & Microsoft. Is there a reason to own either one of those consoles?
This ain’t even funny…tech minstrelry.
Super saiyan god thor 3:00 3:00 3:00

"We in a recession bish look around!" 🤣🤣
I don't know who the hell buy that shit for that price.
When all of them started taking out their switches, I lost it!😂
Lmmfao.  When they pulled out the switch..
The video was good. Mark should have listened to his instincts and its hilarious Leland didnt know what the XBOX slogan was. Definitely a Leland thing to do. But that anime house trailer got some heat.
who here after dey said anime house sneak peak😂
Jesus Christ said repent.
You gotta switch nahhhh 🥷🏾we got a switch 2
😂😂
Fuckin love these guys😂
It's good that they have subtitles because Mark's always mumbling like crazy lol.
Y’all gotta be the longest content house standing with the views y’all got. Cause NOBODY stays in a content house after they lease is up.
Xbox and PlayStation have NO CHANCE of seeking close to this much because they were ALL sold out before they even came out and didn’t restock for months.
360 was crazy 😂🤣🤣🤣
Oh nahhhhhh Charizard vs Madara bouta be crazy
They paid all that money just to rent Nintendo 😩😭
I need anime house right now!!!!!!!!

playstation so dogshit they overheat at fighting game tournaments. constantly. and wrong xbox greatest decision was to do xbox game pass.
2:09 Dyl asking to get out the car everytime 😭😭
Funny funny. 360 really eslly was badazzz, too bad they not creative anymore and just greedy,  putting everything online and one Xbox per person common.
And Xbox slogan is the button swish

17 mill is crazy in 4 days for 1 game 😂🤷🏾
YEOO WHAT WAS THAT AT THE END

Jokes aside, Nintendo selling that many Switch 2 is actually fucking crazy, i dont think PS5 sold that many
Yo this whole skit is brilliant af! 😂 “whatchu gone do re-release halo!?” Subscribed. 🤙🏾
Oh I ain’t even see them 😂🤣😂🤣yo this nigha and desi must team up for the world to laugh in tears

PLEASE MORE ANIME HOUSE
This video feels sponsored asf even tho it probably isn’t 🤣 hyped for the new anime house
Damn they ALL got switchs hahaha. And NEW ANIME HOUSE WITH MAHITO AND POKEMON!!
I heard Xbox is out of the game now...
What good are these sales when the gaming experience on Switch 2 is trash though? Nintendo never uses that money to make a good console. Their netcode is trash, the Switch 2 screen is 33.3ms which is now confirmed to be the slowest LCD screen in the last 10 years, the specs are basically base PS4 level, it has no games besides old games that all the other consoles played years ago, Mario Kart World is a joke where all you do is collect stickers.  Nintendo fans are a special breed of dumb.
Funniest part for me is Playstation talking about "we been grinding for years" like Nintendo hasn't been making electronic games since the 70's lol.
Yuhhh
What super hero would you least like to see come after you if you were a bad guy.
youre an ID-10-T for lumping msft into this video..msft is and will always be a software company at its core...so the more hardware other people make the more software money they make....they will make money off ps and nintendo, and pc players...and will be the same level as tencent and embracer in the end
1:20 Xbox 😅😅
Xbox got that whoom sound 😂😂😂
ahhhh shyt 3:01
LOL 1:06
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🎉🎉🎉😂 How ya let that Nin word gang up on ya so quick &🤫 like that, with Dem"Switches"🤣😜🤣🎉🎉
Anime house if Yusuke Mark doesn't transform into the Mazoku demon I'm done
the way they start smiling and pulling out dey switches is KILLING ME
Shills and fanboys of any kind are a blight on humanity

Patiently waiting for anime house 😂😂

Muzan at the end 😂
They had to cut When he asked what’s their slogan 🪦🪦
XBOX!!?
If you died right now are you a 100% sure you’d go to Heaven?  all people have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. What is sin? Sin is essentially any bad thing we've ever done. Because of sin the punishment is a burning hell. “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭21‬:‭8‬ ‭KJV‬‬ Do u know why you have to be saved? Do u know the story of Jesus? (If yes skip next step) if not do next step. God came down to earth as a man. Lived for 33 and a half years. He never sinned his whole life. Eventually some people got jealous of him and got him convicted of phony charges. He got crucified on the cross. Died. Was buried for 3 days then he was resurrected by his own power.  Do you know why Jesus went through all this bloody mess for us? It’s because remember your sin is the problem why you can’t go to Heaven right? The only thing that can wash away your sin is the blood of Jesus Christ  6For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 7For one will hardly die for a righteous person; [d]though perhaps for the good person someone would even dare to die. 8But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. God did all that to save us from hell. So think about that. would you ever die for somebody? a decent person? maybe. A good person, perhaps a few would die for him.  "Much more than, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭5‬:‭9‬ ‭KJV‬‬ Ephesians 2:8-9 “We’re saved by Grace through faith which is not of ourselves it is the gift of God not by works for fear any man should boast” Salvation is not by good works like “water baptism, attending church, any good thing you do” “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” ‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭7‬:‭10‬ ‭KJV‬‬ Feeling godly sorrow leads to salvation To be saved you have to feel guilty for being a sinner do you feel guilty for being a sinner? “that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭9‬ ‭KJV‬‬ If you agree with all that. All you have to do be saved is this. You have to mean it. Dear God I repent as a sinner I believe Jesus is God who died buried and resurrected so his blood can wash away my sins. So I only trust in the blood alone to save me. Not my good works. save me from hell in Jesus name. I pray amen Just saying it wont save you you have to mean it
0:53 😂😂😂

"You ain't made a good decision since 360" is probably the most accurate statement I've seen on the internet in a long time.
“PlayyStaShawnnnn, Yeah you heard that shi before thats US NIKKAH” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:03 XBOX “we have the games”
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“PLAY -STA-SHON yea you heard that shxt before huh? “😅
😂😂😂 PlayStation to XBox…  “You ain’t made a good decision sense 360” 🤣🤣🤣
S2 is actually $450. It's only $500 if you're sane and don't wanna pay $80 to $90 for Mario Kart World. Which is WILD.
"XBOX!!!"  im Dead!😂

The xbox slogan “SHEEURRMMM”
Anime house 7 otw!!
I remember a couple days before the release I was reading hater comments that were like "no one's gonna buy it. Not one person is going to spend $500 on a switch pro, and if anyone does they're gonna return it when they see the games are $90."
2:55 Ben's stance 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Let's be real. Over 50% of those sales were from scalpers. Nintendo did it slick and made it look like sales were going to be limited at launch. They tricked scalpers into overbuying their product.
He said I don't even know 24 kniggas lol
They bought their own consoles
Sony killing Nintendo is basically a civil war....
PlayStation 😂
They probably are lying I knew ppl that had the ps5 when it dropped Nintendo openly hated and over charging rn. Nobody I know is buying the switch 2
“PlayStation” 🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
This Nigga an actor. This Niggas an actor. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Playstayshun" 😂😂😂😂
Nintendo Ninja everywhere i guess
🤣🤣
JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Christ Jesus paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. What is it that you lose in spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”.......nothing. He offers you the gift of eternal life through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Christ Jesus is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re a sinner, lost without Him and destined for destruction, REPENT, REPENT, REPENT, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Christ Jesus. Have a blessed day!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol😂
😂0:53 That "Playstation" line had me in tears 😭😭😭😭😭 Bruh got it

Stellar Content!!

Sure 3.5 million sales, but the scalping scenes are very bad, so yaay
Bro with the green jacket gained mad weight
"I shoulda trusted my first instinct" 🤣
"you know we got a slogan" 😂
Playstation should use Mark’s voice on their commercials from now on Playstatiooonn
Switch? Title is wrong, it's missing the 2. Otherwise it would be 8 years ago haha. Also missed the joke to say Gears is coming to Playstation, which is crazy.
LETS GOOOOOO ANIME HOUSEEEEEEE

triple platinum lolllllllll playstation is not having it bruh!!!! x box be soft asf
Pauses the video at 3:26 "Oh wow..."
Xbox slogan the truth. Lol
ANIME HOUSE
Release Anime House!!!!
It's funny because Microsoft is out there saying console gaming is dead and there's no audience for it anymore and the business model is untenable.  Meanwhile back on Earth, the PS5 is on pace to the best selling PS since the PS2 and the Switch 2 just had the best launch in the history of gaming, dating back to the 1970s.
this is accurate Xbox dont want to hurt nobody .. but Sony... shit they will take you out..
The funniest thing is not even in the video, the funniest thing is that at some point. These two dudes was in the mirror combing out them wigs whilst discussing what they were going to say.
Anime house let’s goooo! I was rewatching the whole series yesterday no cap. Perfect timing 😊
We in a recession b**ch look around. Bro brought the hood out 😂😂
Holy shit that was like 4 switches, this is thier most expensive skit yet
LMFAO not the 'playstaycionnn' 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aye much love and support yall🩵
“XBOX!” Lmfaoooo, had me thinking “Damb, how Do they start up?” 😂
Switch 2 got people shook haha
Gamers are such reliable lil pay pigs. $80 Nintendo games?! Buy! 🐷  $500 console? BUY! 🐖 Nintendo suing Artist? BUY!🐽 Nintendo sueing Palworld for making a better game than them with better mechanics? buy buy BUY! 🐷🐖🐽
This was hella funny😂
I thought desmond was playing (representing) steam until he said "say it closer" 😂😂
I'm disgusted yall all have a switch 2.......
Play-stay-shaun 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

1:30 LET XBOX KNOW !!!!!
TRIPLE PLAT IN A WEEK IS MADNESS FR
Fuck Xbox. I stand on that. Online play was *free* on my PS3. Them dumb fools paying Xbox360 for online play screwed us all. I already pay for internet why tf am I paying you to use what I already pay for?!
Damn Dylan about to take Lee job the way he put that shit on as Muzan.
“I don’t even know 24 🥷” 😂😂😂 Neither do I
RDC hittin their formal wear a dress moment? Honestly not even mad about it. The kids done made it
didn't nintendo get robbed of $1.4M worth of nintendo switch 2's?
YOU AINT MADE A GOOD DECISION SINCE 360
A funny and light hearted video, but if you dive deeper it reveals a very serious problem in society. When you get big, there will be competition. They will talk about you, know what you’re up to, know everything you do just to make sure. Even if the person or thing isn’t directly harming the competitors, the fact that they are successful gives the competitor a warrant to be threatened. Power struggles.
Why did he say xbox like that 😂😂😂
✊🏽👍🏽 great work lol
Been waiting on Anime House!
Anime house lets go
zailachde elii psdawde hha
I thought got for sure he was gonna hit us with the Xbox startup sound😂😂

“Man these Xbox niggas soft as fuck 🤬 “ 😂😂
Switch them ninjas down. That’s a switch 3 was a bar. 🔥🔥🔥
They from the Underworld lmao
Adele ninja
This shit was PERFECT!
The Xbox slogan killed me 😂
Nintendo proves that consumers and gamers are stupid.
PC coming in clutch with the "I can beat them with piracy"
"I dont even know 24 n*ggas" 😂
360 had hd-dvds ps3 had bluray
xbox not havin a slogan is the funniest sh!t
This shit was absolute 🔥  Too many great moments
Xbox being so mid is accurate af
Playstation has made more than Xbox and Nintendo combined this console generation. They've made more during the PS5 generation than all their previous gens combined 😅
Nah yal rlly gotta keep all the houses going they forever content i swear 💯
New anime house?👀
The reason is simple. Playstation/xbox games care about graphics and realism. But people wanna have FUN. Plus they reeled in more of the kids 😂
"Play-stashawn!" 🤣🤣
Idk who needs to do it but somebody need to cut these guys a huge check too hilarious
You know we got a slogan but then says idk

ANIME HOUSE 7 FUNNA BE CRAZYY
I don’t know what’s funnier: Mark’s “PlayStation” accent or Mark’s “Le’Bron” accent from that Olympics skit last year.
** PlayStation **
At 2:40 when Nintendo exposes his shirt, I looked down to see the same shirt. That I bought in 2005. Bit surreal.
1:19 1:21 1:23
No one knows the Xbox slogan
YO y'all cooking more anime house? with 3d effects? bro take all the time you need I know it'll be worth it!!!!
Bruh don't miss😂

They used all them Microsoft racks on a Charizard lol
Play stationnnyaaaaannnn
Damn, that teaser is looking nuts for real
Nintendo switch is selling in Asia 🤡nobody in the western world has one 🤡it's Nintendo 😂and it's the exact same hand held😂nothing is different. But what can you expect from losers who think LeBron is someone to admirer 😂😂
I don’t know anyone that has a Switch 2 lol.
"You ain't made a good decision since 360!" bro that part killed me, couldn't stop laughing... still buying games on Steam and Xbox, the Play Anywhere option with cross sav between PC and Xbox Series is really good.
After all the leaks I'm disappointed that we let Nintendo get away with the shit they pulled
Lol yooooooo
Can y’all do an nba finals video? Especiallyy since tj McConnell carried the pacers?
Lmao 😂😂😂😂  “They from the underworld”
Isn't Xbox's slogan recently just, "this is an Xbox," while showing random ass shit like a toaster or a smart fridge or whatever?
😹😹😂😂😂
Should had SEGA in the Corner screaming "DON'T BELIEVE THEM!!!"
Yeah but the switch too is getting a lot of hatred
Damn I didn't even them 😂😂
Muzan mahito and the Goat!!! And that charizard look damn near like the Detective pikachu one.. it’s LITTT

Man this xbox n***a soft af 😂 had me rollin

not gonna lie, the thought did cross my mind to get the Switch just for Mario Kart World
"Ya know we gotta slogan right"  "Well what's ya slogan" Xbox 🤷 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
Every 20 years Nintendo drop a bomb on the gaming industry then disappear again.
Ben with this stance though 😂
Nin-do fanboys do be like  Prime Rick and Morty fans ..or pokémon fans, on god
Jojos bizzare adventure need more watch time in anime house fr (I love jjba)
"X Box you ain't made a Good decision since the 360° " Where the lie though?😂😂😂
Heard the verbal agreement and knew them niggas was Nintendo 😭😭
Man gone animate all yall shi...Every series yall got shi would be like yall the new cartoon Network & shi...shi already funny asl, but imagine that shi with the exaggerated like cartoons...shi mix cartoons style of yall favorite cartoons coming up & 💥...Not to yall anime connect too...Yall would have animation screen loc too.

Why does this feel sped up?

This is fuckin good man
Triple platinum in a week 😂😂😂😂
MY 🥷 POKEMON
Wait!  Yet PS5 is 5 new games and the rest Remasters from the previous Generations
"Playstaion" NAH NUAR YOU WILD
There are other ways to have fun without being locked in on a screen for hours at a time, which is what the enemy Satan wants you to do. Satan is the prince of the power of the air and the scriptures say in > > > ... +  (Ephesians 6:12 > For  we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.) + I wasted way too much of my life playing video games, especially the Elder Scrolls series. And I would advise people to do the same as me and hang up the controllers, and by a King James Bible. It has the most epic stories in it, from the creation of heaven, earth, and God's prize creation the human race, starting with Adam, then Eve being created from the rib of Adam. + The reason Adam was God's crowning creation is because he was created in the image of God, with a body, soul, and spirit, where the angels only have body and spirit. + The storyline is incredible, with more than 40 holy men, over 4,000 years, chosen by God, to pen what God inspires them to write / record. And yet all books of the KJV bible never contradict each other at any time. + It gives you the history of God's chosen people, their epic battles, their ups and downs, and their defiance of the God that not only created them, but tolerated their sin against Him and their following of the enemy of God, one of His angels who chose to rebel, "a fallen angel", better know as lucifer or Satan. + And eventually a Saviour is born, who comes into the world to save not only a fallen, chosen few, but to save the entire world, or at least those who would believe on Him and what He has done for them, and what He is going to do for them, eternal life! + Ending with a crescendo of epic proportions. God created us, protected us, and eventually dies for us, in order that we may have eternal life, with Him in an entirely new heaven and a new earth, and new everlasting bodies. + But the final episode is yet to play out. God gave us His final Revelation, as to what "will" happen in the end of days, the battles are fierce, the lives lost is in the billions, the earth will be scorched and land will be displaced as never has been seen since the creation. + What I have given here is just a snapshot of the greatest Book that has ever been written, The King James Bible. Do you check it out, or do you just keep playing in Satan's playground and wasting your life away, the choice is yours, choose wisely! + All glory be to the Lord our God, in Jesus' name. Amen!
Everybody with a switch 😂😂😂😂
This shi got me 😭😂😂 rolling
Let me explain something, With those three point five million units probably belonging to kids, And the current Pricing of switch two games   Nintendo, You need to be worried about the kids attention spans And how much money the parents are willing to spend.
my guy got bernie mac eyes
"Playstashon" 😂😂
Switch 3 😂😂😂
Sony made Nintendo and actually it was supposed to to be Nintendo PlayStation before Nintendo said no and that’s how PlayStation came about 1994
Nintendo lying frfr
It will take years to catch Sony and by that time a new system will be out and the 5 flagship games Nintendo has will be overdone like always.
Most of those are up for resale, look how many players are actually online
BOUT TIME FOR ANIME HOUSE TO BE BACK
1:14  it’s the “ wooong” sound
Pastor Mike Todd is talented 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
xbox slogan is "JUMP IN." i do so believe.
That cgi in the anime house teaser tho!!
They not gone last long they might have high sales for the first 3 weeks but after that the sales will dry out fast
1:40 ps pressing xbox for not needed rereleases is crazy since last of us has gotten what 5? in the last 10 years
Microsoft needs to retaliate and make a “Xbox” 😂
Yall kill it everytime
Legends right here ❤
😭
0:15 yall n***** Gottw get some Heart!!!!🤣🤣🤣
playstation hasnt anything crazy till the 2 just by games alone or disregarding psp (which on its own beats playstation 3 and on...)... and games like that nintendo and xbox/microsoft lead since (including working together and bringing things which sony can only beg itself to work with to get to some place at least...).... bluray was the only thing 3 really had apart from attempting a network that pails incomparison to the xbox live network that 360 brought about improving on what made xbox from the original since day 1...  the fact people have to mention 360 shows how successful its been... the network has been worked through all iterations all the way through to the pc and works with microsoft services and even ea, epic games, and now others... including nintendo...  sony isnt in this... they tried making knock off wiimotes for a harry potter game and failed...  yet xbox went along and improved that idea as well, making the kinect, AND it works through multiple systems... NO controller necessary... AND they made polished games for it... INCLUDING big titles...  ever since then the only thing sony has is a number. they are on 5, and now what? 5 pro?  but people without thought relatively in irony go to bark at xbox.  the xbox one still has a inclusion in the overall market for xbox systems... nintendo only has the switch, and playstation has mostly 4 and 5...  and people been upset with the 5 for many reasons... just to get it and brag about something they dont really like... just to have it... its dumb... but you want a 6 already?... just to have a 6...? but you want it yet complain that isnt like a switch 2? but the switch is just a.... second switch... which is a finished wii u... which is a second wii... which is actually advanced gamecube...  but if you werent complaining, youd be worried and following a ps6.... and that it isnt a 5 pro... but the people with 5 pros never had a concern anyway if they got 5 pros... and why would you buy and play ps6 after going through 3,4,5,pro and 6 just because other people had 5 and pros...   now post series x/s and gamepass is a thing...  gamepass has prevailed and crapped on anything ps had since the ps2 apart from psp...  it goes across not just xbox, just one xbox, not just pc, not just browsers, not just mobile...  it goes through every system since one, including games since xbox original, gets deals and has full access content games, has regular and arcade games... goes with ea and epic games and probably other... works with pc, mobile systems, browsers, and has cloud storage... and it has deals and decent prices where you can choose between seperate system plans... you want just this or that system, or it all????  sony wont ever come up with something like that. even psnow is nothing...  all you have is movie rights laundering... talking about releasing games...  meanwhile all sony is about is ea games, cod, and gta... oh and guess what and who runs that now?...   and yet you also want gta6 to go with ps6... what a buncha crock...
"We in a recession, bitch! Look around!" 🤣🤣
Where y'all been bruh?!
I’m freaking SCREAMING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lmao
"Xbooox"  Bruh, that's not my slogan  I fuckin died 😂😂

Bro took Charizard right put detective Pikachu 😂🔥
LET'S EFFING GOOOO!!!!!! NEW ANIME HOUSE HELL YEA!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ben looking like the perfect Nintendo gamer 😂 👌
Xbox's slogan is "power your dreams."
I don't see the big deal on launch sales. Total sales will be what really matter.
damn people still brought the switch 2 even though i don't see any really good reviews on it lol but i would only get a switch with a new pokerman game
“You know we got a slogan” “What is it?” *shrugs* Lmaoo 😂
Anime house is BAAAAACCCCKKKK
Yoooo Anime house is back!!!!
Ey bro, thank you for all y'all do and your friends too 😎🤙 Anytime I see one of y'all in a short or video I ain't seen yet, best believe I'm watchin it👊
This is lame
we got ash in a battle???? BRO THIS SKIT WAS HARD BUT THAT TEASE WAS SOME CRAZY WORK. you mfers on demon time rn!
Xbox aint worried about nintendo. The steam collab kills everything
Would love to mention how niggas were getting hype and shit about the price tags saying “this is crazy” 😂
shout out to Nintendo
Steam Deck master race right here lol
The switch 2 hatin psyop did not go as planned lol
Nah but Nintendo was going to do PlayStation foul in 90s ifykyk
Bruh idk if i should be lauging or offended. Im a xbox player but they did xbox dirty in this one 😂😂
Y’all did green jacket dirty in the thumbnail
Paid in full quote and a announcement in one vid is crazy work
Brodie in the durag killed those allegations immediately 😂
Let’s gooo !!
Wasn't xbox's slogan "jump in"?
PlayStation rippin on Xbox for re releasing Gears of War is funny as fuck given both The Last of Us games been remastered revised revitalized re re re like 3 times apiece lmao
Why bother robbing folks, when you can join Nintendo
Why Playstation stop psp production i the first place
I also don’t even know 24 niggas to get ont he game with
Nintentards really just made the industry worse for all gamers
All the haters propaganda didn't work 😅
Part of their high sales low key was from fortnite supposedly if you bought it you can get an exclusive emote 😂
“Playstashun” had me weak af 😂😂
That Charizard killed me.
yo. people are actually buying the switch 2?? Doesn't that thing brick if you try modding it?
Gears of War 2 was the greatest game ever made.
Playstation really the only one behind right now with the switch 2 and xbox taking theyre exclusives they really dont have anything right now
“That’s just me using my deduction skills!” 😂😂😂
Even Xbox don't know they own slogans. I'm sleep 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kd to the rockets vid?
😭😭😭
X     Box 😂😂😂
These guys are great!!
Honestly idk what recession they are talking about.  I made it to where i can but it just to have it. Because I'm a game
"aint made a good decision since 360 🥷! What you gone do?"  When he know xbox got that ROG Xbox Ally in his pocket
Leiland is too funny for no reason😭😂
Mark reactions are always on point😭😂 How is he not an actor???😂
To be fair Xbox has the best accessibility behind Steam
🤣😂🤣
2:00
Ayye not to much on Xbox the cloud gaming is dope lol
Yooooo, that Charizard was amazing!!!
Absolute Cinema! Magnificent! GENIUS!

Leeland eating good.
Everyone talking about the "play-sta-tionn" but nobody talking about the xbox slogan "xbooox!" Bro im fcking crying
PlayStation talking about or releasing gears of war and halo again. Ya can’t wait for the last of us remastered for the fifth time.
I seen this upload and thought I was hallucinating
Why does RDC look like Bernie Mac😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Release more skits
ANIME HOUSE FTW!!!!
Hiding Anime House announcement in a random video is lowkey genius.
Nintendo been grinding longer than PlayStation
How tf y’all give a grown man chills after seeing that anime house is coming back and with that style 💀💀💀 it’s about to be crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y'all even snuck in an "Xbox sign off" reference 2:33 😂
0:54
You guys are so amazing that this +50-yr-old BW who knows nothing about gaming, fully understands the  console wars. 😂 Like, I've got a Wii from 2010 that I've yet to use. 🤣
The fact that the switch 2 sold at all is embarrassing
Nintendo simps are the worst
I can’t wait for that new anime house
Close to a million views in 1 day...over a gaming console.... pure genius what yall doing
Switch 2 Is literally a downgrade too thats why its funny
Leland got swole
Now I want a video of Nintendo telling Playstation to get some exclusives.
Playstation actin' kendrick when he said, "I hope they came with three switches" 😂
I felt that "Playstation." Lol love these type of videos
Yo was that my boy fucking Charizard😮
🤣
🔪  switch 3
you'll play Mario Kart for a week and be done with it. DK looks fun but the same thing will happen with it most likely. idk anyone who bought the Switch 2 so far, just internet ppl. lol I might consider it if a new 3d Zelda comes out but that's it fr. Prices will never drop and it just doesn't look that impressive, it's more like a Switch Pro with no new games.
Lolz
BRING BACK THE PSP
2:53 Ben hittin the most Nintendo posture of all time💯
Xbox off
Nah I’m done with Nintendo, shit too expensive just for they mid games. I could drop that much for the Xbox handheld since it got steam an everything. But 800 bucks to play Mario cart? 😂
Anime house 7 finally happening
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The world is lucky I don’t know how to create game consoles. I would be such a menace.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
People said they wouldnt support a 500 dollar handheld that doesn't come close to steam deck, yet here we are. I hate gaming.
yeaaaaaaaaaaa
Xbox that sound effect 😂
We do know that PS5 would’ve sold more if they had enough in stock I couldn’t pre order and once it came out it took a month to finally get one I’m not including scalpers really hope Sony learns from there mistakes on there next console
yall not seeing the fucking end omg 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was too funny
I don’t know if yall got old ass Ben running the account right now but change the playlist back where we can watch video game house 1-5 and anime house 1-5
Sony!!
😳🤭😂🤣😭
Love, the Game.
"Platatiosean"😂😂😂
Kill is expensive lmao
PlayStation going in hard on Xbox. Lol.   All you need was a PC guy to walk by at the end.  Lol
I feel like consoles been dead since 2019. Since I went PC never went back. And that's a broke me with no upgraded PC. my shit isnt even that good
Its funny hearing PlayStation say that Nintendo is lying about their sales numbers when Sony literally lied about them magically finding a couple million PS2 sales (decades after the console stopped being sold) the minute the Switch sold more than it. 😂
2:39 oh my gosh 😂😂😂😂
a new anime house before gta 6 is crazy work
Sad part, this is straight true. I've decided I'm never buying an Xbox or PlayStation console again, but I'll buy Nintendo until I'm in the grave
I cant wait!
1:05 😂😂😂😂
WHATUP WHATUP!!
hey funny as hell skit RDC but uhhh, y’all forgot Charizard’s tail-flame, just a heads up!! 🔥

Between french lebron and dominican PlayStation.. Mark outta control lol
“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world.
10/10
“Play-Stay-Shon” 😂 Ngl, this the first laugh I ever got from any of these RDC videos
Bro said ❎- BOCKS 🥀 😭😭😭   Edit : CHARIZARD COMING TO ANIME HOUSE !!!!!!! 🏡

RE RELEASE HALOO 😂😂😂😂
Mark too good with it. 😭
1:26
Jump in
Btw Xbox's tag line is. "JUMP IN" ogs know this. Look up the original Xbox commercials
Shid Xbox turns more profit than both of them😂😂
See kids real gangster  dont ask for verbal confirmation  😂
Xbox fight  back or stand down and  let game cube come back 😂
Xbox still use the jump in slogan
Nintedo switch  finally a rival to xbox and Playstation 😱 this console war about to go wild 😂
3.5 mil is unbelievable because the Switch 2 has nothing new to offer. It has to be because scalpers over bought and because Nintendo was sneaky as fuck; if you play Mario Kart there is no way in hell that game is worth more than $50 but Nintendo told everyone “when you play Mario kart you’ll see why it’s $90”…  then there’s always the simps who will bend over and buy it because they can’t let go of all the IPs. That’s what my research says.
"Xbox got his head down like he in DETENTION and ISS at da same time🤣
posting everything but anime house 🥀🥀🥀  3:00 MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN 😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I'm still that E to the T
You know we got a slogan... What is it.... ..🤷‍♂️
Man I had to rewind that Playstashon about 10 times 😂😂😂
PS5 was the biggest disappointment of all time
I love that xbox is more of a supporting role in the transaction because xbox knows it's the worst of the three
😂😂😂😂
Gah damn these folks funny
That Nintendo reveal was crazy!!! 😂😂😂
No way anime house coming back
It's crazy when you think about Mark, Lee, & Des all being cousins. Funny really does run in their family 😂😂
Yes new Anima House
Ben holding that switch killed me 😂
Did the PS5 even make 3.5 million units (that the scalpers didn't snatch up)? 🤔
😭😭😭😭😭😭 Man dat “Playstayshunn” got me HOWLING
Honestly yes Xbox and ps5 put Nintendo in this position and loyal customers showed up. Crazy how that works even though switch two is an L Shows people will take the minimum when everything else is bppty
Rerelease gears of war 😂
Did Xbox dirty 😂 stop playing with us😂
I still love my Playstation  over Xbox  n switch
@ahmadofficial255
Yo!!! Anime house!?!? I thought it was done! That Charzaid looked sick.
PlayStation getting heated over Nintendos reported numbers is so funny (looking at you, updating PS2 sale numbers)
YEAAAAAAA  ANIME HOUSEEEE!!!!
Play sta-shuuuun😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Xbox” lmao 🤣 the
What's the Xbox slogan?
That’s Microsoft money😂😂😂😂
big ups to anime house
You ain’t made a good decision since 360 🤣 yo
"i don't even KNOW 24 🥷!"
For real does Xbox even have a slogan?
If Nintendo got VR it would be over. Imagine switch bowling, Mario cart, or Smash bros in VR
"gun em down thats the switch 3" 😂😂😂😂
New anime house let's goooooo
New Anime House?? Was that Mahito and Cha-ri-ZARD nigga??? 🎉
The Nintendo crew suddenly looking goofy as hell as they pull up the Switch 😂
Correction there are no 90 dollar games in the us and the console is only 500 with mario kart world included
ANIME HOOOOUSE!!!
Yo mark face at 1:40 got me cryinnn😂😭
Yooo a new anime house 🔥🔥🔥
Yoooooo 😂😂😂
1:38 bro the shots and cuts really feel like reality tv 🤣🤣
Fun fact: Nintendo has sold over 140 million units of the original switch (since mid 2024). I read an article that stated Nintendo sales were starting to drop, not because of lack of interest.  Simply put; almost  everyone in their target audience bought one!!
Lmao they messed me up when they pulled out the switches 😂
Yes
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THANKS GOD ANIME HOSUE IS COMING BACK
Lol Xbox has a slogan but not even Xbox knows what it is 😂
😂😂😂
Funny as hell, but goddamn! the filmmaking!  the lighting, the shot selection, the framing of the lean-ins… The craft shows!
"You know we got a slogan!" "What is it?" "......"
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLY GHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
"So... y'all want me to kill Nintendo cause y'all hating"; "We got switches on us right now", that was fire foreshadowing.
“Ion even know 24 🥷🏾” 😂😂😂
The sneak peek was crazy!
triple platinum in a week is crazyyyy😂😂😂😂
Playstation would have won if their console was actually affordable and easy to get.  Xbox is atleast an Option
switch 3 is diabolical LMAOOOOO
Nah if you bought a switch 2 ur the biggest low iq tool. You literally pay more money to not own your games.
LOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!
"Playstashawn" 🤣🤣
People forget to realize the PS5 had a bad launch. It was extremely limited cuz of materials and all.

HOOOLY  F*CKIN' SH*T!!!!!!!  THE ENDING!!!!!
Former Member of House of Representatives: Justice Will Prevail  Hirosato Nakatugawa, former member of the House of Representatives  For many years, the issue of forced organ harvesting in China was unknown in Japan. Former member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Hirosato Nakatsugawa has been working on this issue for 20 years and was the first person to take action in the Japanese Parliament. He worked with David Kilgour, former Canadian MP, and human rights lawyer David Matas to continue the investigations and information dissemination.  Due to Japan’s economic relationship with China, it’s very difficult to discuss the issue of forced organ harvesting publicly, and the media seldom reports on it. However, in recent years, Japan’s Sankei Shimbun newspaper and certain TV programs began paying attention to this issue, so the public is becoming increasingly aware of the situation.  Mr. Nakatsugawa called on the people of Shibuya and Yokohama to pay attention to the seriousness of the issue of forced organ harvesting. He warned that children’s organs may also be harvested in China, and this problem may become more serious in the future.  Mr. Nakatsugawa appealed to the Japanese government, calling for the adoption of a resolution criticizing China, and the enactment of a law to protect Falun Gong practitioners. He firmly believes that justice will prevail and said he will continue to work hard to solve the problem of forced organ harvesting.
I know muzan didn’t just sit down and look the other way, Dylan that was too clean.
Nintendo sales are children an adults that are not really game risks that only play games from 25 years ago in offline mode you can only play Zelda Pokemon and Mario so much oh don't forget like Sonic or whatever
Who else paused the video to count the cash ….😂
Sony should've already been the goat of handheld gaming. THEY HAD PSP, but what did they do to Vista ? NOTHING
Never seen an item get carried as hard by nostalgias as the switch
“We in a recession b***” 😂😂

Nintendo lost a step, but people buy it anyway. Sky high prices, no innovation, infested w/DRM they'll brick your device over, super old games for new prices, still using friction joysticks so they will break, janky streaming, fake physical cartridges. Nintendo corny AF now.

ANIME HOUSEEEEE
Give your life to the Lord. Amen! + Trust in Jesus Christ, not antichrist. + I hope and pray that folks change their view and invite the Lord Jesus Christ into their life to rule and reign.  Satan is referred to as the prince of the power of the air for good reason, he owns the airwaves on planet earth and is the god (little g) of this world. It is my hope and prayer that you choose the God (Big G) of heaven who controls the destiny of your eternal soul.  (Matthew 10:28 > And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.  (2 Corinthians 4:3-4 > [3]-But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: [4]-In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.)  (Romans 10:9-10 > [9]-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. [10]-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.)  (Romans 10:13 > For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.)  (Ephesians 2:8-9 > [8]-For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9]-Not of works, lest any man should boast.) + (Revelation 3:20 > Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.)  Is Jesus knocking at the door of your heart? Is this your opportunity for eternal salvation? If it is, I hope and pray that you open the door and invite Him, (Jesus), into your heart and life, in Jesus' name. Amen!  All praise and glory be to God. Amen and Amen, Jesus is our God..
*Surprised Ninitendo is still staying alive.*

Apparently Xbox's slogan as of 2020 for the Series X/S is "Power Your Dreams". I had no idea. And Nintendo has a new slogan yet again. It's "All Together, Anytime, Anywhere". "Play has no limits" is apparently for PlayStation 5

Congratulations to Switch 2 sales, early, really congrats, fastest selling console. (When Switch 2s finds outs  XBOX IS XBOX+PC NOW... O.o... congrats it sold more than Xbox consoles, their direct hardware, but they are on MIcrosoft Windows now, they are in cloud 9 now, they are in the cloud... they are 1/2 a BILLI platform USERS strong... > 80-100 mill nintendo active monthly base. (jus sayin).  But CONGRATULATIONS to all NINTENDO fans for the fastest console, sales, i also am a Nintendo fanboy :D
The African  next to mark going at least 39lbs 😂
I love y'all RDC!!!😁😁😁😁😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤

Why this sounding like a GTA mission?
😂
.. XBOX!!🗣️🗣️😭
Hardest post credit scene in a long time!!!!! AH babbbbbbbbbyy!
2:22 The messed up dap was the give away😂
Thank you guys this HILARIOUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣

" XBox: It's Good to Play together".
Ben be looking like a kid once he pulled up the switch 😂
Ben can barely move in that tight ass jacket😭
I like it, but could have spent more time storyboarding.
0:54 The way he said PlayStation had me rolling. Had to rewind like 4 times. 😂
Yall silly man😭
Thats a switch 3 neguz 😂😂😂
Nintendo is older than Microsoft and Sony combined.
This skit after they been playing Mario Kart World is crazy 💀
Between Desmond looking around at the "we in a recession look around!" and Mark doing the console slogans i started CRYING 😂😂😂😂😂
😳😅😂LOL DAM‼️🤣😂🤣
Anime house finna be toxic 😂😂😂😂😂
W announcement can’t wait
Nah the fact that PlayStation is the rachet one lol makes this so true
X box is owned by Microsoft who also is responsible for iPhones so put some respect on Xbox name
Lee and dyl sitting down at the end! Lol I'm hyped. needs to become a whole ass show at this point 🔥💯
RDC killed this one and the anime house bit at the end...nice!
😂😂😂
Why that one dude look like chris tucker and kevin harts kid😂😂
Undercover dude should’ve been SEGA. Nintendo carrying them at this point so it would’ve made sense 😂
😂😂😂😂
Why Xbox and Playstation are giving money to Steam?...
Mario Kart cost 90 dollars, i dont even know 24 niggas, lol ha
I dont know Xbox slogan either
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This mark variety is definitely sinister mark 💀💀💀
Nawl yall ain’t slick putting in that anime house teaser I need dat and video game house asap
You ain’t made a good release since 360😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They sold a lot but everybody know it’s trash right now. It’s more “newer” than “brand new” and has 1 game which turns out is empty apart from the races
“Oh they might be on something” 😂🤣
Nintendo fans are the worst gamers 💀 they bend over for Nintendo.
If BING is the browser of XBox he woukd be acting like Playstation
Bruh they need to make 1:03 their slogan fr.
I love the energy and banter here, I would watch these three in a series.
Dang they put on a dress 😢😢 they got him
lets gooo anime house
4 switches in one household is crazy
Like for the anime house 😤
0:48 Bro you ain’t gotta be that deep! 😂

Missed opertunity: "ayo is that a ninja back there. These biggas hard for real"   Turn out it a nintendo ninja
Let’s be real you buying something that you can’t even own I’m good
Isn’t the Xbox slogan the sound effect?
Ben, Dyl, and ippi lookin tough ngl😂
Love the vid😌
Y’all know we got a slogan lmao what is it ?? Lmao
"Triple platinume in a week" lmaooo
ima be wild honest ive yet seen a switch 2 at somesones crib or a little kid with one lmfao
Mark is right because PlayStation 2 is still the highest selling console of all time for the brand and they haven't reached those heights since 2000/2001 but Nintendo did it in 4 days so Nintendo is doing something right that Sony PlayStation is failing to do
He said they had them switches tho yall not listening lmfaoooo😭🔥
😂Xbox don't even know they Slogan 😂😂
Nahh lee out here looking like Ben 10 😂❤
I don’t understand. Switch just have Mario kart 🤷🏾‍♂️

What is XBOX slogan I never heard that shit and I had 4 in my whole life
« PlayStayCHUN »

😂😂😂
Des look like a thug foreal 😂 with the polyester bomber with the hoodie attached on some 2012 Chicago or Detroit shit
Sega "Saaayyy-Gaaa!" Wonder what Sega have to say about this !?! Sega got beef with everybody lol Top Opp!
Dam fam they wearing dresses they took that Hollywood money
People was like no way in hell i buy this well well
No way PlayStation was flaming Xbox for re-releasing games. ☠️
3:09 is this 🥷🏽 rimaru from reincarnated as a slime?😭
That “killum” in Des’ ear is severely underrated. That’s that old school, taking something basic and making it funny
"that's the switch 3!" LOLOL 😆
Straight heat I'm so hype for AH6
PLEASE RELEASE ANIME HOUSE!!! 😭😭😭
Bro I’m crying 😂
Most sales definitely from Scalpers that are fkd themselves over by buying to many switch 2 😭
lmaoooooo "switch 3"
Facts
Goodness this skit is absolutely hilarious 😂 l know l'm gonna rewatch it multiple times!!
Xbox is fire
I honestly cannot get enough of RDC hahaha
“You been making bad decisions since 360”😭😭 no bap
1:36 “re-release gears of wars” 😂😂😂 Istg a new halo or gears of war keep coming out like those games were good for what they were. remaster left 4 dead and bring back avatar games
I’m not gonna lie. That part where PlayStation is asking XBox what his slogan was made me laugh so hard I drooled. I’m admitting that as a woman. 😂❤
😂❤
I know PlayStation isn’t talking shit about re-release at Xbox when their STILL remastering shit that’s hardly 5 years old
😂😂😂
"PlayStayShawn" could be a gaming channel name😂😂😂
😂😂
Oh
I was just about to comment “real funny where’s anime house” 🤣🤣🤣 w clutch up
Bro, we at least need a 10 second preview next time on the new anime house wtf

When the ps6 come out in 2 years its sales will be even crazier the ps5 would have had insane sales but it was just a shortage because of covid and why many people think it was a let down most people didn’t get they ps5 till like a 1-3 years ago the ps5 was literally impossible to get for like 2 years I’ve never seen a console have so much hype in my life

The amount of memes that are gonna come from this video bro. It's already a classic😭😭
Playstation been beefing with Nintendo from the very beginning 😂😂😂
Main thing with Switch 2 sales was supply. They made enough in advance to sell those numbers. If Sony made more PS5s at launch, they would have similar numbers. You can only sell the supply you send out.
not eliminating a competitor thru literally process of elimination 😭
ANIME HOUSE IS BACKKKK
IF YALL DONT MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT LOUDER!!!!
literally incredible. Love you all and your work. Keep grinding and keep up the excellence!!!!

This shi is brazy, ppl who love Nintendo must be rich because I know damn well you ain’t paying all that for basically the same game but a bigger system
Smh Nintendo the mothafucking GODFATHER!!! Don’t forget what they did to Atari, SEGA, CDI, etc.  Y’all don’t want that smoke 💨
AYYYYY ANIME HOUSE COMING BACK, WE GOING BRAZY
*Meanwhile in the World of PC:* "Look at them down there... fighting amongst each other over something so... miniscule." "I know. How uncivilized."
0:54 Mark why you do that?   Damn near made me die during lunch lmfaoooo   Can’t even front that hoe iconic like a mf   PLAYSTATION 🗣️
CGI in anime house!?
'they from the underworld, yeah they from the underworld!'😂😂😂😂😂
"Hadn't made a good decision since 360 nga" 😂😂😂 Facts
Nintendo selling this much makes me want to give up on the gaming community fr 😂
LMFAOOOOOOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂
Where is the hood avatar
I GOT THAT SWITCH ON ME... AND MY GOONS BOUT TO SMASH
3.5 million..fellas thats just Japan
Adele 😂. Mark killed this. So many one liners 🔥🔥🔥
Even the PS5 wasn’t this controversial during release. Even the PS5 pro. All I heard were people bitching about the Switch 2 being a ripoff since you don’t actually own it
2:09 Nah them boys were ready to go!!! Joycon Boyz 😭😭😭
Na Lee ass is acting 😂😂😂😂😂 that shoulder shrug was so deep 😂
Maybe Playstation could sell more consoles if they would stop releasing peripherals that costs as much as the system. And stopped raising the price of PS plus.
Why do i feel like ben is really smug in the background with that "playstation" 😂
Wooh, new Anime House!
Jin woo in anime house finna be hilarious he about to arua farm while the whole team get beat den pull up last min 😂😂😂😂😂

I lost it on the Xbox slogan part when Leland shrugged
I thought Leland was gonna do the Xbox turn on noise
Did Nintendo Switch 2 actually sell well?
Waiting for the moment for Xbox to turn around after speaking to PS to shake hands with PC/Steam
Xbooxxxx that's their new slogan for real now 😂😂😂😂
Bruh 😭
No good decision since 360 AGH😂😂
😂😂😂
mahito a demonnn
NEW ANIME HOUSEEEE FINALLYYYYYYYYY
I know this is a joke but the switch 2 didnt have to go through the same hardships as playstation and xbox during its launch. Playstation and xbox both had chip shortages and they released during covid. Im pretty sure we all remember playstation 5 and xbox series x being sold out even months after release so , its not really fair to compare sales when there just wasnt enough produced playstations
PLAY STAY ĆIONN🗣️😂
1:20  💀💀
What’s PlayStation gonna do re-release the last of us
"Ion even know 24 n's" "You said you gotta a switch" 😂😂😂
2:39 "Nintendo Rehabilitation Clinic" shirt???

They made this for the tax right off on those switches 😭
Brooooo Lee shrugged 😂😂😂😂😂
1:43 I fully expect Microsoft to do it again but for PS5 and Switch 2, same with Gears.
This is my favorite skit cause I love my Switch, and honestly PlayStation and Xbox would be that petty 😂😂😂
PlayStation in the LeBron French accent had me dying 😂  Also I don’t care if you all are 80 years old shooting Anime house. It’s too good!

“I don’t even know 24 niggas like that” 💀
Damn, someone's aging.
Hell ya anime house let’s GOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥
PlayStation 2 the most sold console on the planet
rerelease gears of war😂😂
PEAK
They bought 4 Switch 2’s for this video, crazy.

Ps2 DID do numbers like that
Leland is looking rough!
1:15 should of said "power to the players"  PS: "🥷🏾 thats gamestop!"
Mark funny af
Irl all 3 consoles are doing bad with their sales. Most people turned on to pc as it makes no sense to own a console in 2025. All frame is capped at 30 when the pc games of those consoles are at al flawless 60. They look better, run better and looks smoother. I still dont get why anyone would get a new bricked switch, a greedy mid ps5 or xbox
Everyone forgets why Playstation's mad because Nintendo cheated on them with Phillips in the 90s and the reason why they're in the console wars to begin with
rdc always on point 🙌🏿
1:28 man that's so true it hurts
Low key im making hecka money to buy the switch 2, hopefully multiple, BUT WOW DID NOT THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO THE SWITCH 2 0:19
Fire video 🔥🔥 ANIME HOOOOOOOOOOOOUSE🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

Announcement at the end was sick
I ain't even see them. They look like that came from the underworld.   Too many quotable moments here.
SWITCH 3
gaming is cooked
ANIME HOUSE 😃🎉
2:54: Ben always look unserious asf 😂
The Switch 2 is TRAAAASH. The only reason it sold so well on release is because they had a TON in stock early everywhere.  You can walk into retailer that carries them and get one. If PS and Xbox had that much inventory on release as well, it would be a different story. Dont buy into the hype. It's hot garbage.
3:22 “What channel?” -Android 16
Knew the guy had sum to do with Nintendo after seeing the red shirt through the hoodie😭😂
You ain't made a good decision since 360 😂
1:09 XBOX!😂😂😂

Mark kills me with the accents 😂
Was power to the players xbox or was that also Playstation lol
I Appreciate y’all putting in the work for another episode of anime house 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Them prices are outrageous
Why did take out his Switch like THAT!!!???🤣🤣🤣
"I don’t even know 24 niqqas" 😂
Them yns be playing switch that’s why they got the switch on them😭
Xbox Slogan: "Everything is an Xbox". 😂😂
Let's face it after that new Donkey Kong game trailer Nintendo's going to be making money for the next 10 years off of that alone because all those features and everything in it looks like it would last 3 pandemics!
we been seeing yall streams cutting it up in mario kart 😭🙏🏼
That nigga Dylan in the Muzan fit was tuff
I love these niggas man they unstoppable
Bruh literally had me look up the Xbox slogan 🤣
Zar look nooooiiiccccccce
That blue blue asf
all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, by ether lying, stealing, looking with lust, taking Gods name in vain, and more. we broke God‘s moral law by doing so, but Jesus paid the fine on the cross. He died the death that we should’ve died so that we can spend eternity with him. We deserve Hell but Jesus took that punishment for us. He loves us so much.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16 KJV  Jesus died for your sins and he loves you, turn from your sin and repent. To give your life to Christ confess to him your sins and confess and believe in your heart that he died for your sins and came back to life.
😭😭😭😭😭
The ending 😂😂
They from the under world 😂😂
Anime house!!!!
Dylan as muzan is fire😂😂
I doubt that the switch will sell well over time. Naturally most new anticipated products have a massive wave of purchases at the start. Deltarune and Mario kart helped validate the initial wave. They're gonna attempt to keep justifying the system with the new dk game next. But it's just way too tough of a sell that I can't see them outselling the switch. Whether or not they'll sell good enough though still remains to be seen.
What’s yall solgan  I don’t know😂😂😂
This nigga dez turned up immediately😂😂😂😂
U ain’t made a good decision since 360 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
finally shit
😂😂
Man I’m at work I didn’t need to laugh this hard

“I don’t even know 24 ninja’s 😂😂😂”

Yo is that last second a new video coming?! Oh my gosh
MARK IS HILARIOUS
Verbal agreement 😂
Japan really hijacking the market they up price  and basic Toyota/Lexus vehicles and they doing the same with their game consoles the Japanese market really taking advantage of suckas
Nintendo is backed by Mega Corporation, so this is the only way they can compete…
Leland got violated in the thumbnail bro wtf 💀💀💀 made him look like his criminal doppelganger
re-release what ...gears of war😂😂😂😂😂gears of War goated chill
That’s the switch 3!!!! The trailer thoooooooooo!!!!!!
Playstation - Play has no limits Xbox - Power your dreams  Nintendo - **too big to have one I guess
U ain't made a good decision since 360
Anime House 7 let’s goooo
1:20“And even if they ain’t lying, switch them ngs down, nyyyooouut!!…that’s the switch 3 nga!” PlayStation WHAAAT?
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermons!
Lmfao 😂😂😂
Sega: 😎🍷
0:48 "I don't even know 24 🥷🏿's."  Me neither man.
0:55 “PLAY STATIOUN”😂😂
“I don’t even know 24 niggas” is a legit ass gripe 😂😮‍💨
.....For those unaware (like the normies in this skit), Nintendo shorted supply chains on purposed to artificially boost their sales numbers.  This was *WIDELY* publicized (along with all the numerous Nintendo and Switch 2 controversies) and is being talked about by gamers all over the Internet.
I am from Saudi Arabia, I have been a fan since 2017.  Anime house, let's gooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ‏‪ ‏
Mark is a creative genius no cap bro
3:22 Dylan clean asf

Xbox got the “WOOM” from 360

They have even pulled the mask off and TOLD people they'll brick your system, but people are still buying?  WHAT!?!?!?!?!  Nintendo might actually be on demon time with real demons.  I'm not trying to start shit, I'm just sayin.
ANIME HOUSE??

ANIME HOUSE!
WHY NO ONE TALKIN ABOUT ANIME HOUSE COMING BACK??
This ish toooo funny!!!
I thought the hitman was gonna be Steam 💀
PLAYSTATION 2 SOLD 160 MILLION UNITS 😅
Anime house 7🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Even though Nintendo raised the price of their console overall they're still the most affordable way to game right now
Dylan is clean with the muzan fit I'm ngl
Xbox being super chill and not giving a shit is too accurate
That’s the switch 3 LOL
PlaySta…shon!!! 😂😂😂

Plauystation, What is it,  you ain't made good decisions since 360!!😂😂

Charizard!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
ANIME HOOHUUSSEEE😭😭😭😭💔💔
These guys must be sponsored sad to see Edit ALSO MOST OF RDC JUST MAD PS IS GONNA BE IN THE WAVE WHILE XBOX PASSES
bad decisions after 360 - diabolical.
Anime house finna go crazy
Is that my boy Ash Ketchum.
They some Demons 😂😂😂
Sony takes forever to release a game, PS5 Pro is a waste of money. Gamepass is legit, but Xbox first party stuff isn't good.   Nintendo makes quality stuff, doesn't need massive day 1 patches, art style over graphics, solid innovative gameplay..........yeah, they're cleaning up
That just lets me know that all the console haters on YouTube are stupid. Because the way they were talking, I was sure the switch 2 was gonna be a flop. Then again, when has Nintendo actually missed…besides the Virtual Boy…we don’t talk about that one
Yeaa these niggas just found another series 😂😂
I know playstation aint talking about re releasing games when thats all they been doing for past 5 years
Shofu gave RDC the pokemon hookup? Lol
That Xbox jacket CLEANN
Mannnnnn I would be the perfect wildcard in the group
I feel like y'all took this one really personally and were VERY emotionally invested. 🤣
lol, what IS xbox's slogan?  don't get me wrong, I love PC gamepass, best deal in gaming..........but I didn't know they have a slogan
That's a switch 3. lmao
Still waiting for the OLED version 💀
was that charizard!!!?, in 3D
2:56 Ben got it bro😂
No one knowing the way mark said “PlayStation” was from benchwarmers 😭😭

Can’t believe the Nintendo mains really payed $$$ for a mid ass console, overpriced game, and having ZERO rights to the games that you pay for. I’m sick.

This exactly why Nintendo didn't change the price m despite tge outcry in their stream. They knew their fanboys would buy it anyways.

“Whatchu gonna do, rerelease gears of war?” As if PlayStation ain’t been rereleasing the last of us 10 times lol
That’s a switch 3!
No way that teaser just got me soooo hyped! Love y’all’s content ❤

Nintendo said astrobot my ass we got donkey Kong not everything has to be Mario I hate astrobot winning a game award game of the year that it should have been wukong
PlayStation got to bring back Uncharted now
😂😂
Ain't no way they got a Live Action Pokemon battle in the Anime House.  MCU start sweating, RDC coming for y'all real soon.
Best cliffhanger 🤣
Xbox what’s your slogan? 😂😂😂
I know Nintendo lying, them switches still sitting at my 3almary and Gamestop😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
Mark nailed that, Playstation 😂
New anime how looking hard
Xbox really hasn’t made a good decision since Xbox 360 though. That’s the last Xbox I owned. They fell off so hard after that 😭
Damn, that Switch 3 line was hard!
X box ain’t got no slogan lol
Nintendo making those numbers means we lost. It’s only a matter of time till playstation raises their prices too…hopefully gta 6 will bring balance, i already know people will drop 2k, cod, fifa and all that slop when gta 6 comes out.
3:24 What does this mean for video game house?
Funniest "Switch"-up at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mahito finna be in anime house 7 🔥

Nintendo really sold an over expensive hand held with only 1 available game.......and broke tons of sales records 😂 Thats wild.

Playstatyionn
That’s that switch 3 🤣

Nintendo have a mindless sheeps as a "fan base" that will pay any amount of money for sake of nostalgia, and don't understand the concept of boycotting, that's the reality we live in.  Sometimes I think they have a masochist feitsh or something 💀

Yes
It's hurts as a playstation and xbox player to hear nintendo succeed over them after all these years.
ASHH?????
Ali Siddiq

I asked God, “How much do you love us” and God replied,  “This much”, and  stretched His arms on the cross  and died for me.  When you carry a Bible, the devil  gets a headache. When you open it, he collapses.  When he sees you reading it , he faints.  When he sees you living it, he flees.  And just when you’re about to copy and paste this,  he will try to discourage you.  I AM A FOLLOWER OF GOD I have made  the commitment,  I am saved through Him.  CHRIST IS KING 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 JESUS LOVES YOU ♥♥
WE NEED A VIDEO GAME HOUSE PLEASE
They started off showing a portion of what Nintendo paid them for this ad 😂🤦🏾‍♂️ STILL NOT BUYING THAT $HIT! Nintendo be asking for bags like they kidnapped Chelsea Clinton 😂😭

After checking google Xbox’s slogan is “Power your dreams” but nobody would’ve knew that without google 🤣
3:02 Anime house 7 bout to go crazy 🔥🤌🏿
Microsoft bought out Activison/blizzard for 68 billion
Y'all can NEVER be done with anime house!! The world needs it!!🤣🤣🤣
Honestly the lack of exclusives is what is killing both consoles. Especially with Steam getting games from both consoles.
Even xbox doesn't know what its slogan is man that shit sent me onto an mental adventure trying to remember what their slogan is lmao
Like almost half this video is just roasting Xbox😂😂
Ben in the bubble coat fit the exact description 😂😂😂
The slogan is "Thinking out of the xbox" in case anyone was wondering.

PLAYSTASHON 🗣️🗣️🗣️
The way he said PlayStation
Why was Ben holding the switch like that lol
Nintendo always watching 😂😂
The nintendo switch 2 was the first console I wanted on day one since the Xbox 360. Xbox one i waited 2 years for sale and same with series x cuz the trailers and announcements made them look like high-tech dvd players.. Glad I got the series x at $300 cuz it definitely isn't worth $500. Shoulda jumped ship to Sony. Atleast their products retain some value after buying. Trade in a ps5 game to gamestop you get $15, trade in the same game for Xbox series x, u get $2
“Play…stay…Sean” lol
That announcement!!
1. This shi was mad funny 2. I’ve been WATING for a new anime house, I knew it could not be over
Oh th new anime house boutta go wild
I KNEW that was a Nintendo Ninja. This is why we don't mess with Nintendo, they've got ninjas all over the place😂

"You ain't made a good decision since 360" ooo so true though.
Xbox is hesitating because they've been wanting to buy Nintendo for YEARS.   Nintendo even laughed them out of the room when they proposed that.
The reason why PlayStation was so pressed and XBox was so chill is cause Xbox got the microsoft money that not worried but Sony going through it
"They from the underworld" 😂

OmGGGGG!!! Fam!! 😭❤
Funny thatXbox is now the chill platform that's sharing their games with everyone. Also Playstation can't talk about re releasing stuff like they don't keep doing that with Last of US and giving remasters to PS4 games
Anime house is my fav of your series
PLAYSTASHONN 😉

HUSTLE FIR THE HUUUUZ!!!
Should've seen this coming of course he was Nintendo😂😂
Mark is comedy gold man😂he be delivering some simple ish in style I swear!
If this ain't proof that ALL y'all is fake as fuck... I don't want to ever hear none of y'all ever say or complain again about these games or consoles are too expensive and these companies are too greedy... Cus all y'all gonna do is be performative online and then buy the shit... FOH
Orochimaru, Mahito, and Muzan?  Vililan house is doing to much.
0:40 We definitely are, and like how in TF!?
To be realistic, nintendo only got these sales because this is the first time any company has actually had enough stock for the early adopters. That and 1/3 of ALL sales are the Japanese only consoles. Remember how hard it was to find a ps5 or switch 1 early in its life, now you can literally walk into your local Walmart and cop a switch 2 no hassle
That shrug 😂😂
"Yeah, I do got a switch, I got a switch right here" "Oooh Whaaat??" 😂😂
Mark was so in character he really hate Nintendo 😂😂
“I do got a switch I got a switch right here” 😂😂 everyone saw this coming

🎵 XBOX 🎶🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
funny enough, Nintendo recently said that they don't consider playstation a competitor except in Japan because most consumers buy both consoles anyways and they see their markets as separate
I already knew what it was when I heard that verbal agreement shit! 😂😂
Adele 😂😂😂😂😂
"PlayStashunn"

If you look at what sony did with the cd this on brand

I thought Nintendo was about to ennnd them😭
At 1:26 missed opportunity to say "xbox turn off"
I felt not knowing 24 people.
I think its cuz they probably made more units then the ps5 and xbox cuz they were sold out instantly as well and took forever to restock
This the switch 3 😂 whoever buying the switch GOOFY
That Charizard at the end look pretty nice
Switch 3 is crazy
no good decision since 360 got me weak
Xbox slogan is: Jump in
Them Nintendo ninjas are insane! They work, like they the FBI. I knew  PlayStation and Xbox were alone together for way to long.
3:04 nah dont piss me off i wasnt ready for the walk in 😭
1:24 that’s a switch 3 🥷🏾!
0:00 Leland already dropping his gems per usual “yeahhh that’s Microsoft money 😈💸”

3:04 nah dont piss me off i wasnt ready for the walk in
Its not that hard it's a Japanse company and the Japanese love Nintendo
The way mfs was tripping over the price just to still get the switch 2 needs to be studied. Y'all know who you are. You screwed all of us. Now everybody is talking their games being worth $80 😂.

"Switch them niggas down" 😂😂
:)
Anime house is about to be a phucking movie! Literally!
😂😂😂😂😂
I own all 3 consoles and a gaming pc  They only broke the record because they mass produced the switch 2 using most of the pieces and stuff from the og switch, and used old but more expensive to replace tech
“Ain’t nobody hatin that’s just me using my deduction skills…we in a recession b**** look around” 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

New Anime House YES!!!

Ain’t no Way we got Charizard in ANIME HOUSE before gta 6…💀🔥
😅😅😅😭
...Talk about switching up on peeps lmao 💀
WE GETTING DANDADAN IN ANIME HOUSE
Despite being team Xbox. Xbox is soft 🤧
Maaaaan Nintendo is making a killing, and they are already bricking people's switches😂😂😂
I still think it was mainly scalper sales
For all the hate Xbox gets, I would think by now they would have stepped up their game content
"That's a Switch 3 n*gga" got bars 🔥🔥
Anime house holy
1:15 Xbox slogan is just a sound lol... and Iconic one none the less though😂
Xboooox
Mahito cosplay!!! Lord Muzan cosplay!! Damn I don't recognize the one on the left, I'm guessing Getou Suguru!
when that Video Game house coming out
1:20 “Switch them down! That’s the Switch 3!!” That caught me off guard 😂😂
That Ending🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
😂😂😂😂😂
nintendo 3rd part games sales are mediocre af
The worst part about it is JOYCON DRIFT IS BACK.
Letssssss gooooooooo!!!!
ANIME HOUSE LETS GOOOO
this 🥷🏿leland look like Ben 10
3:12 Nga tf  leland wearing💔
"That's the switch 3...." I am weak
Dyl got that drip.
thats not my slogan bro 😭😭😭😭
Can I have a release date please?
Gotta feel bad for the mfs that clicked off as soon as the skit ended. RDC got Charizard in their backyard.
1:04 😂😂
Whats ur slogan 😂
The whole world over men are pretending to be women and women are pretending to be men. I think that says a lot about the current state of mind people are in😂😂
This the best switch 2 commercial I've seen so far 😂
I saw this on tiktok 😂
Why is no one talking about the new Anime House teaser at the end 😭🔥
Xbox definitely doesn't have any slogan I can remember.
🤣😂🤣💪🏾
My joy when I saw the red shirt underneath the coat was immeasurable.
Bring back hood avatar mark 😂
Switch em down that’s a switch 3😂😂😂😂
nintendo can have my $500 next year
PlayStation " mark got it😂😂
Pulling out 4 switch twos is diabolical 😭
Mark doing the "playstation" voice got me on the floor🤣🤣
Thats cuz in japan it's priced at 300 dollars equivalent of American money. Much cheaper. And Mario Kart World does not meet expectations. It's not an impressive upgrade nor the game. Do not buy and support the Switch 2.
2:55 why ben playing like that
Anime house around the corner is gonna be legendary 😂
The Orochimaru chuckle at the end 😅 Lee in character
Ben not being PlayStation. Tragic lore.
Anime house look crazy already 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mahito and MUZAN!
Crazy how Nintendo still able to put up numbers with the tariffs, game prices, and the public backlash of the console price.

“Ohh myyy gahh - Ay dis shii corny bro! 😫🙆🏾‍♂️”  😭😭😭

Nintendo building their empire off nostalgia
The way they Ipi, Ben, & Dylan were CHEESING' at the end of the skit wit' their Switches in HAND!!! 😆😅😂🤣💐👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
new xbox handheld coming soon and they got steam 😭 playstation needa set both them up now
3.5 million sold in only 4 days at $500 a clip is pure madness. 🤯👍🏿
Play station rereleasing the last of us over a hundred times 😂😂😂😂
Leland representing Xbox is peak Leland😂
This might be y'all's funniest skit 😁😁😁
Xbox got the 360, but PlayStation the one trying to spin 🔄

Switch been selling so good PlayStation said “Aye we forgot about these 10 million PS2s we must’ve lost count somewhere”
😂😂😂😂
Here to comment
Lmao xbox is a company that has a rhythym instead of a slogan. Like home depot or doordash
Des is soo old 😭
"We got a slogan" "What is it?" 🤷🏾‍♂️
Yoooo 3D animation is insane did des do that? And Ash is gonna destroy everyone there omg
They from the underworld 😂😂
“We in a Recession B*tch”😭 that shii so factual 😭💯
Man I can’t wait to see the new anime house in 2029
they pulled out the switch lolololol
"switch them niggas down thats a switch 3"
PLAY-STAY-TION 😂
0:41 "We In A Recession Bitch!" 😂
Ain’t made a good decision since the 360 is wild😂😂
"U know we got a slogan!" "what is it then?" 🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
“Triple platinum in a week? Who tf these 🥷’s think they Adele? 🤨” underrated ass joke 😂
“They from the underworld”😭
As a Halo fan, not a single lie about X-box was said 😓
Yeah if niggas buying a $500 console with a $80 kart game we’re cooked from here on out. I gotta find a hobby lol
Playstation for Life.  Nintendo got bootlicker Fans.  Xbox aint even for the culture, they only exist coz they got billions to basically sell games for free otherwise they Fall off.
Nintendo are pimps😂
silksong finna save xbox
Ya'll ever thought about using crash dummies for skits?  Feel like it could take RDC comedy to the next level.
And just wait until that DK Bananza drops, looking like an even more fire game. Switch 2's boutta start flying lmao
as a new Xbox user, I find this very offensive. 😢
Oh that teaser looked fireeee I’m ready for it🔥
No but who rlly paying those prices
😂 we ain’t finna kill nobody
"PlayStashioon" lmaoo
Im not shocked about xbox but nintendo passing up playstation? Wow😭😭
PlayStation: Black Air Forces X-Box: White Air Forces
“Yeah we got a slogan” 😭

“I don’t even know 24 🥷’s” 😂😂
Nahhhh yall was really up at 7am working!! Appreciate yalll for the streams and videos yall really help me get through life💯
“I thought you had a switch I do” 🤣🤣
🗣️“PLAY STAY SHAUN” was on point😂
That’s that switch 3
PS didnt sell that fast because of the shortage😭 a switch should never be the same price as a ps5 in my opinion, and $90 for a base game???
PlayStation 5 stands for the only 5 exclusive games you can play on it. Xbox Series is a variety of trash can 😂
They all got a switch 😂
That's the switch 3😂
Anime HOUSE 88888888
not the SWITCH... im dead
XBOX
“THAT’S A SWITCH 3” 🥷🔫
"Just follow them." 😂😂
"Playstation" took me out bro
"That's the fastest way to handle the situation." 😂😂😂😂
“So yall want me to kill Nintendo cause yall hating” 😂
😂😂 Playstation a fkn G. “Triple platinum in a week?! Who these mfs think they is, Adele?!” 😭😭😭😭
Triple platinum in a week is insane😭😭
Leland with that Ben 10 ahh jacket is killing me😂

Nintendo is AHH! The games is weak asl😂😂
“Triple platinum in a week” 😂
