Elon also just tweeted saying, "Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area. Nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month."
Well, now that 8 has failed in a similar manor we have to ask just how many time do they need to get it right?  The number of failures is growing and when compared to the old days when NASA was doing things they'd take the time to get the hardware right before launch and then address whatever shows up as a problem.  They did not have many failures after the early 60's, by Gemini the failure were minimum and by Apollo they were successful in every launch attempted, Apollo 13 only failed after the TLI burn that occurs after reaching LEO.  I'm beginning to think that maybe the move fast and break things approach isn't really compatible with spaceflight!
I’m waiting for Trump to blame the Democrats - or perhaps it was DEI.
What happened to this channel? You just disappeared.
Elon Musk pressed the wrong button on his remaote.
I would say it has a long way before I feel safe putting people on it
Hudson Institute Director Shea: I Don’t Believe the CCP Regime  Nina Shea, Director of Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank, speaks at a press conference on September 4, 2024.  Nina Shea, Director of Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said during the press conference, “I salute Mr. Cheng for his courage. He is the only survivor [of live organ harvesting] to publicly stand up against this horrific atrocity, and we need to hear his voice.”  Shea said that when she met Mr. Cheng last week, she saw the scars left by the operation on his body up close, checked the scans, and read the doctor’s and expert reports. Shea said, “I believe him, I believe he is a survivor of the CCP’s live organ harvesting. I don’t believe the Chinese government, I don’t believe the CCP, because the CCP has always lied, confused the public, spread false information, and covered up the facts.”  Shea said that [live organ harvesting] is still happening, and she doesn’t believe it will stop unless there is an international independent investigation team to investigate.   Former Congressman Frank Wolf addressed the press conference.  Frank Wolf, who served as a U.S. congressman for 34 years, expressed anger at some mainstream media in the United States for avoiding the issue of organ harvesting from living people in China. He asked at the press conference, “Where is The Washington Post?”  He thanked Mr. Cheng and said, “It takes great courage. If a person has experienced all this, they would want to forget it completely.”  Wolf said that the CCP’s organ harvesting from living people has been known for many years, and people have learned about it at rallies and other events, and it’s already known to everyone. He said, “Our government has failed the Chinese people on this issue.”  Like Congressman Wolf, Hudson Institute Director Shea is concerned about this. “Our outstanding medical schools and universities have become accomplices, providing research and training programs to China.” The records of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) show that American universities have trained 344 (Chinese) transplant doctors.  Shea said that the medical schools heard about this crime against humanity, but they have not even raised questions, nor have they asked China where the organs came from, or asked them to confirm the source of the organs.  Wolf proposed to bring legal action against doctors, institutions, hospitals, training centers, etc. in the United States and other Western countries that participated in the CCP’s organ harvesting to stop this behavior.
Just a minor setback
The only unfortunate part of the incident was that Musk was not aboard.
I wish some Americans would realise that when speaking at speed it is difficult for others to understand what you are saying.
so - do u want to go inside of this? i dont
Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly > translation; It blew to freaking pieces ! :) lol Musk is so awesome though :) He probably shrugged about as much as I used to, when a 20 cent bottle rocket was a dud :) lol ....oh wait, bottle rockets are supposed to explode ?
Is this the second time they use this booster or was it a new one?
君の名は
BOO HOO HOO I AM SO SAD FOR LITTLE LEON AND HIS JUNK SPY SATELITES WE DON T NEED MORE WE NEED LESS INTRUSION SPACE BELONGS TO NO ONE ESPECIALLY NOT THE AMERICANS AND LITTLE LEON
So pretty
Nothing like a flowery technical description of crash and burn!🔥
great video
Build by Clappers and Scammers  What can go wrong
rapid unscheduled EXPLODED!
Aphobis and his little friends MovieGreenland! Cant be debris because this falling down⬇️
And does anybody know how much damage to the environment this has done?
Abandoned this program .
No need to watch the video, it was shoddy rushed engineering and unrealistic promises by Musk that lead to the failure.  Cheers!
Who cares it’s wasting 100’s of $ billions of our taxpayers money, why.  Who cares what’s on Mars?  This is all a Con job by these effing billionaires, STOP WASTING OUR MONEY!
From the "genius" that brought us the cybetruck...😂😂😂
Looks like a tesla in a tunnel on autopilot. Hope you don't expect to get paid for that elon. The American people want results, they do not want to pay for your closeness to the fool president you paid to elect.
US space programms do not work without german war criminals
Why do they keep calling it a "Starship?"  "It's just a rocket!"   Same old rocket tech from the gemini & apollo space missions!
And this is what is suppose to go back to the moon when we cant even get off our own planet over 50 years later? And who is going to build the landing pad up there? If ever there was proof it was all lie, finally we know for sure.
blue origin vindicated to be honest, mission first, cool tricks later
When he starts trying to steal our money and then I quickly lose any support for this at all.  This guy is ruining everything that was awesome and amazing about space exploration.
That was awesome see that booster get caught. I really hope the FAA stays out of this and let's SpaceX get right back to launching. I'm really hoping bc trump is back that there will be great change at FAA and they stop going after musk it's crazy how much they stop innovation. And they let Spacex launch two ships a month. That will really let Spacex get to Mars quick
"A rapid unscheduled disassembly"  What a word salad.  You mean it exploded, or blew up.  Lol
Another Elon failure. They are mounting in everything he touches.
Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly...😂😂😂😂😂
Unscheduled dissassembly 😂 I can hear these guys in the bedroom.  Houston, we just experienced an unscheduled fluid discharge, ready the back-up tool...
Guess those H1B geniuses aren’t doing so well.
"rapid unscheduled disassembly"?
How does the booster know how to get back to the chop sticks ?
SpaceX is going to need to coordinate better with the FAA when they launch.  It became a big deal quickly for flights all around the Caribbean. Aluminum planes don’t hold up well to space buckshot traveling supersonic.
The commentary done awesome, cool, calm and collective, very entertaining indeed..
Exactly? It BLEW UP !!! lol
being a Tesla product, probably the rope and wood block holding things in place failed
Here's me thinking we should have been to Mars already .. according tibmusk himself!  Meanwhile they can't even get the ship into orbit never mind stay in orbit never mind get to Mars... the man is so full of shit
That had to be expensive 😮
This should keep Elon busy and out of politic for a long time😂
This reminds me of the submarine that imploded. A space Karen in charge of all this with billions of dollars,  who talks complete and utter bull£&#@. The sub had issues and corners were cut and SpaceX's wasting of money is disgusting. They are no further forward really than the shuttle was over 10 years ago. He's got what he wanted as Trump is now in charge and he'll get even more funding to stroke his enormous ego and bull&£#@ America even more. He IS clever, but only at talking Sh1t, giving false statements and leading America on.
A rapid disassembly, yea I guess that would be a good and scientific way of saying it blew to pieces lol.
Raining down debris over inhabited areas is really unacceptable after this many test flights of Starship upper stages. Move fast and break thing is all fine and good until the thing you are breaking weighs 100+t and is located above someone's head.
Shouldn’t we be on Mars already according to Musk?
And his buddy from Epstein Island only pays 750 of them dollars for taxes. I feel better.
Encore un joli feux d artifice qui n'est pas donné...
Meanwhile NASA isn't doing jack-squat.
Space X said the rocket experienced a Rapid unscheduled disassembly.,instead of saying it exploded.
There’s always set backs when pushing technology. NASA has had many.
got plenty of fools looking at the pretty fireworks. thats millions of dollars. could have been better used for something tangible. not one hard working u.s. citizen will ever reap any benefit from this total waste of money and time. not to mention, this junk has to come down somewhere do people have to be killed by someone elses frivolous toys? how about that beautiful plume, reminds me of Christmas wrapping paper burning. i bet it is just as polluting. look at the pretty sky but dont breath.
When spacex goes public it will attract the biggest group of suckers let alone prove it isn't about the space it's about dollars
How informative.
Musk is contributing to global warming with his rocket hobby and littering space with Starlink blight, yet denying the CA wildfires were related to anything man-made. He's gone so far right that it's all about his money and toys now.
❤❤❤ELON YOU ARE SO STUPID Man ❤
So what if it blew up? The starship is just a tool for advertisement. spacex isn't working on anything else that necessitates a super heavy launching; not even with starlink. It's sole purpose is to dazzle more investor to keep spacex afloat & sustain the image that spacex is the only go to company for space launching.  B.O. did also say that, "So, what? It's not my money".
Nada, el que se cree un dios es un pobre hombre, me alegro que esplotara,
Blablablablablablabla
Don’t be fooled. That’s not what debris from a rocket looks like. This is something entering our atmosphere. Debris comes straight down. Come on people use your common  sense. Look at the video. They are all lying. They know exactly what it is.
As they used to say on early  SCTV, “It Blowed Up Good!”
It failed.  Say it.
Why do I live?....
I need more than 79% to live.
it will blow up.
humans up there, maybe.
Thy landing, 100%.
next month.
Not good enough for me.
45nseconds.
Do you want?
Emm bull shit.  Who is this?
Who is this?
Who is this?
A test?  Then say it.
Root cause.
It failed.
THE STARSHIP LAUNCHED!!! GET YOUR INFORMATION CORRECT!!! IT MALFUNCTION “AFTER” IT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED!!!!  GET IT!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Not even God can destroy this rocket.
Money is no object for Elon...as long as it taxpayer money.   I'm willing to bet this so-called "Heavy" is overbuilt and overly complicated  with 33 engines/16 million lbs thrust.  NASA's largest SLS, also  designed for moon missions is half as powerful, as was the Saturn 5 that got us to the moon safely, multiple times. Elon's giant rocket is an ego trip.
Worst starship performance since "We built this city".
Oh well...Musk is learning fast what it means to too closely align with the drama/trauma  Rumpass.
Everyone's life is precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: Though we are sinners and do bad things, breaking God's law, He loves us too much and so He sent Himself in human form (Jesus) as a perfect sacrifice to die the death penalty that we deserve. If we trust in Jesus' sacrifice and turn from our sins out of love, we can be "bailed" out of our punishment of spiritual death. The Bible says "the wages of sin is death". Please consider Jesus!! ❤️
Thank you
Screw Musk. I won't care about one of these until Elon goes into space and never comes back. He can take Orange Hitler, Bezos, Zuckerperm and Fox News with him too.
"rapid unscheduled disassembly", a lot like a negative healthcare outcome...
And now the FAA has grounded Starship!!
I bet thundercuck is devistated he didn't stream this one
Thankfully, this time it wasn't "a rapid unscheduled disassembly" of 50 people traveling inside it.
It hit the firmament
Rapid unscheduled disassembly 😂😂😂😂 Written just like a Whitehouse press release.  Conversion to the dark magalomaniac side complete.
there goes another twitter
What’s the black bit flapping about on the nose cone at 3:28???
The transparency, absolutely fantastic.
Looks like a catastrophic fail to me.
Flames in 0ro air? Ok come on. FLAMES IN ZERO AIR. Wood + OXYGEN + Anything on fire including lit cigarete = FIRE. WOOD + NO OXYGEN = NO FIRE.
more junk from president musk.
Love this style of video
It's a really good thing rockets never blow up whenever people are on-board.
He blew that up
Melon Husk’s belated New Year’s very expensive fireworks.
The sad thing is there is a lot of sick evil people in the world and I wouldn't doubt that there is a mole in space x purposely sabotaging the rocket so Elon will fail that's how miserable democrats and fcc and his haters r pathetic
looks like a sick way to start WW3!
😭😭😭
Exactly?....Blowed Up Sir!
Just imagine how many Americans health will suffer or will even die, just so this 'Rich kid' can play with rockets that usually blowup. Well at least those Americans Hillbillys who voted for Trump and Elon get the greatest fireworks display. 👍👍
good news is was a ttest flight no crew on board
All fake guys assholes earth is flat with a dome above
Its all cgi guys itsfake space dont exist the earth is flat nasa is fake hollywood wake the fuck up people 😅😅😅😅😅
💯🤍💪🏻🧠⚡❤️🔥
Афера. Самая дорогая игрушка в истории человечества - гимн гордыне И. Маска. Никто никогда на этой ракете ни на какой Марс не полетит.
Hit the firmament .
Lots of information in this concise video. Thankyou for the update.
~😂£€§¥€£§😂~AVeAve~
Probably engineered by the same top engineers that did the Cybertruck😂😂
Very monotone and talking too quick, no explaining RUD until the tweet showed the acronym. Needs work!
"rapid unscheduled disassembly" lmao
"Very… EVENTFUL"…? Gawd, just say it: it was another FAILURE.
I'd like to see the reaction in the control room when the RUD was experienced! 😉
Thats what happens when you trying to steal jeff bezo lunch
What happened to SpaceX? Ha, Ha, Ha.
Mu concern is where the debris landed and who was affected by that.
Sign me up for Mars 👽
thanks for spoiling the 7th launch attempt with your click bait icon /s
No whining. I LIKE IT.
Bro are you a rocket propulsion scientist or astrophysist. Your explanation is point 👉 to point ☝️.Even the spaceX team also watched this
“We are obviously bummed out about our ship…..”   Sooooooo yeah 👍🏾 lotta space trash
Whatever happened, it couldn´t have happened to a more evil pos. His life is going to explode when the truth about his many dealings with hostile foreign nations and far right Nazi groups is exposed. Not to mention him spending a quarter billion dollars to help trump cheat in the election. #MuskForPrison #TrumpIsATraitor #TrumpIsARussianOperative
7th flight and still explodes ? Not good.
Too bad Elon and his lover trump were not in it.
First thing the Dept Of Govt Efficiency should cut funding for, until it works right. Stop pissing my tax $$ away.
One expensive fireworks show.  When you have engineers and workers that are average, what you need is tests and more tests and more tests.  These failures should have been tested and calculated before to avoid this in the first place.  Anyone want a ride to Mars?
From an astronauts view( were I in the program), this is becoming fairly alarming  as this is at least the 10th time that Elon's Starship has failed to reach orbit. For context the Saturn 5 Apollo rocket system never failed to put a mission into orbit. Not once.
Was it using Tesla batteries?
The starship in reality in many years away from reaching mars, maybe a decade...musk is being conservative with the truth.
Was it really a RUD? It basically announced itself and slowly progressed so a SUD would fit. (Slow Unsceduled Disassembly)
It experienced a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” lol why not just say that it blew up…
when launching a shet load of fuel into the sky something interesting will happen 😊
7th flight  😂 Failed it until you make it  😂
For educational purposes I would of liked to have seen the onboard breakup of Starship. However I can understand if there was anything classified in the footage.
Woo-hoo!  Another successful stupid party trick! If that doesn't keep the fan boys calling this massive failure of a program a 'success' nothing will.
That sure was a cool explosion, but it’s a shame about the Ship. After they nailed the catch I was all excited about what we were going to see from the Ship, with all its upgrades. But hey, Space is hard. And you know what? If you took the Starship booster and New Glenn’s upper stage you could have a whole functioning launch vehicle!
Back in 1959 I was on the SAC ICBM guidance crew at Vandenberg AFB in California. Some have asked me if I would like to go into space. Are they kidding? You are sitting on one of the largest bombs made by man. It only takes one gasket failure or a bolt not torqued enough and it all comes apart.
One of the most beautiful RUD reentries ever.
Me thinks, In the words of Porky Pig " That's All Folks", we really need to defend SpaceX. They're doing nothing but sucking tax dollars faster than Melania sucks many rods.
Wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars while the CEO is high on ketamine playing videogames and tweeting racist BS at 2 in the morning every night... 🤷‍♂️
Not a rocket that will be making it to the moon with people in it. It's cool a booster can come back. But a Starship getting to the moon then landing and taking off again is a very long way off. N.A.S.A date to getting humans back to the moon is not going to happen with a Starship for a very long time.
well on the bright side it was a beautiful light show.lol.... what spacex has been able to do and make routine is astounding.
Yesterday’s incident will severely curtail Space X from launching over the Gulf of Mexico in the future. Pilots and Passengers from multiple Airlines have been uploading videos to the internet, showing how dangerous such an incident would be across aviation corridors in the Gulf even when SpaceX is heavily  regulated. I would expect SpaceX will be grounded for the foreseeable future with relocation to South America now on the cards.
Rather cumbersome way of saying that it exploded. But that is the American way. The idea that the more multi-sylable words you use the more knowledgeable you are.
Contaminación para todos y todas
Why have safety regulations  , who needs them. Not spacex
Красиво
Спасибо
I subscribed. You got to the point and spoke in the speed I need😂😂😂😂
this entire carbuncle of a program is completely doomed and will probably never launch a single human into space let alone get anyone to Mars.. but the program will not be cancelled before billions, possibly trillions more dollars are pumped into this fraud and government cronies milk it for everything its worth in the mean time
" An unscheduled disassembly "........In layman's terms,   it blew up!
ELON TRUMP
Shit happens
You were supposed to be on mars already…
MECO is NOT Most Engines Cut Off. it is MAIN ENGINE CUT OFF.
I hate Elon musk
Jesus, drag the video for longer why don't you, GFY
Everything muskRAT makes is a ticking timebomb.
The front fell off.
New subscriber - straight to the point
Musk has 400 billion. Let him fund these failures. Musk is a Nazi. Musk has never had an original thought. Musk bully-buys other's creativity and claims it as his own. Musk hates our Constitution. Musk hates our Land. Musk hates our People and We the People need to shut down his dildo factory in Texas. Musk is not to be trusted. Musk killed Ukrainians on a deal with Putin. All government contracts with anything Musk is involved in should be canceled ASAP. Musk is a traitor. Musk should be deported.
It wasnt pointy enough !
fElon
"rapid unscheduled disassembly"... that's one way to put it. 🙂
Why can’t they say the rocket blew up instead of Rud?
Rapid unshceduled Disassembly ! IE.   ,An Explosion :
Great journalism.  One suggestion, would be to use less "insider jargon /abbreviations".
The arrogance of the boys playing with these toys is what is amazing to me.
Boom! Could not have happened to a bigger jerk!
Where did ALL THAT FALL? It just doesn't evaporate!
Such a "can do" attitude in SpaceX.  That's America!
Subbed.  "Just the facts, ma'am."  No face shots of some dude, no crazy headbanging (or worse) music.  Good job!
Fake company, losers!!!
It went Bang ! Simply as that !
Wow, even their failures are more spectacular than most.
Damn aliens interfering again😊😊😊
They call the tower Chopsticks what is it made in China or something? ...they need to change that name 🤦‍♂️
I prefer rockets that don’t explode during testing.
So many Raptor engines appears to be its saving grace. Even with one not lit the booster found the tower and landed perfectly. These boosters are the Goldilocks of space advancement.
How does fire work in space or a vacuum
Starships are ment to fly  Hands up and touch the sky  Let's do this one more time.
Unfortunately we're not getting anywhere to have people on Mars we can't even get to the moon we can't even get in a low earth orbit things are blowing up people are stranded at the space station let's get real here I've been in astronomy since the seventies but looking around today I'm just being realistic guys it's not happening with all of our technology it's not even happening
Maybe Elon can get some blueprints from NASA from the 60’s.  NASA was able to send spacecraft to the moon and back.  In the 80’s we had 4 spacecrafts go into space and returned to earth and land at an airport. Then they could be reused.  The government should have not privatized the space program.  Elon is getting rich off of government programs.  Elon’s space program is taking us back to the 50’s.   Progress?
Great video complete with a useful narrative.
Two rocket launches and two partial successes. Blue Origin achieved orbit but were unable to land the booster. SpaceX caught its booster (super cool watching that) but lost its upper stage. I have no doubt both organizations are hard at work analyzing telemetry data to figure out what went wrong. Looking forward to IFT8 in a month(?). Guess we'll see how quickly BO can get the next NG stack ready to fly. Is there a pool? My guess is around/after Halloween.
World's most expensive bottle rocket!
Out of control, US rocket dangerously falling out of the sky which could have endangered people below. FAA should investigate this reckless act.
8 minutes after launch there was a rapid unscheduled disassembling. The US is T-minus 4 days until the entire country experiences what the dynamic duo of narcissism has cooked up for We the People. Hope Space X doesn't become the next Boeing in the News Cycle.
Now if all YouTubers could do the same. I hate videos over 20 minutes with only a few minutes of actual news or data.
Rapid unscheduled disassembly ?
What Exactly Happened On SpaceX's Seventh Starship Launch Attempt?  It went bang, that's exactly what happened,
Space Craft, I thought it was a Cyber truck!
1:33 MECO Is Main Engine Cut Off not Most Engine Cut Off............Small detail i know but you know what the comment section can be like
3:59 kind of wild that we literally have a fire in the vacuum of space...
I like how, rather than just saying it came apart, it's condensed into a neat acronym, which makes it sound less catastrophic. "Rapid unscheduled disassembly" is pretty funny. 50 year aviation technician, here.
They going to kill people, close call
I liked Elon better before he became our President. 👺
Thank you for this EXCELLENT CONCISE COVERAGE! SUBSCRIBED!  All the best, Rob in Switzerland
Listen all a yall Its S A B O T A G E
I'm sorry but it's so pretty
Skillful work in capturing the booster, which YOU successfully did 100%.🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂
the German V2 failed as well. it is the name. at least that name was familiar: V2
Were those pictures showing starship pieces entering the atmosphere real or fake?
Trump evil bad luck will create failure. 😂
He said whatever, tax money pays for it 😂
NASA made it to the moon, space x is a waste of money.
Hell, they were driving cars on the moon 56 years ago. WTF. Great report, better than anything else.
WAS MUSK ON BOARD...FINGERS CROSSED.
No-nonsense reporting. Good job.
Fire suppression?? Rapid reassembly sounds more adventurous. And cost-conscious too!!
Anyone else notice, during the live video of the initial launch, the duct tape coming loose ?!?!
Anyone know what the payload was?
Ai video!
At 6:43 min, why this high altitude the Earth looks like flat?
moonlanding is faked if i see this
In 2017 Musk promised to send 120 humans to mars... . So far he just has send a banana to LEO and sunk it in the Pacific Ocean.
At 2:10 min, we are at 55 miles of attitude and the Earth looks like flat. There is a problem.
The same fate that the narcissistic psychopath will have! 🤣😂💥
Anyone died?
Where is The 2nd stage video...
This is really unbiased. Great work!
Weren’t they supposed to be on Mars by now?!
Unscheduled disassembly 🤣
Boeing sends astronauts to the ISS with some serious issues but successfully returns the ship on the 3RD FLIGHT (only 2 tests) and everyone is critical of their record ... SpaceX looses its ship on the 7th TEST and people still love it. Yes yes its bigger, but SpaceX approach to fail until you succeed is too wastful and indicates that they are not entirelly sure why they were successful, its dumb luck, it only gets trustful after a few successful cargo flights.
Haste makes waste!!!!! This is Gods way of saying don’t be thinking too much of yourself!!!!
Bummer...
Looks like a dragons breath shotgun blast.
Chemitrails enthusiasts, are you herę? We need you expert commentary!
*"rapid unscheduled disassembly"*
Very good reporting, thank you 😊
Great stuff Elon, even better than new year fire works.
Lets make america great again 😂
Excellent early analysis! More insight today as telemetry of structure and fuel system are further investigated!
I am not a Bezos Boy by any stretch, but this coming after all of the whiny stuff about the delaying issues with New Glenn is fitting. Turns out that this is not routine at all - that things happen - and that even Space X is bound to "drop one" now and then.
Starship go Boom! (As expected)
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Load of bollox
The Government should Sue the crap out of Elon Musk for rocket scattering litter around and disrupting air service……he can afford it.
7:36 - Epic transition edit.
seeing what the sky looks like when a starship RUD reenters the planet. imagine what the ISS would look like when its time comes if they would retire it with all modules attached
Yesterday Elon Masks rocket ended in.... Russian version, - Starship explodes in ‘meteor shower’ of debris. USA & their Allies, version - the rocket suffered a “rapid unscheduled disassembly”. All others version - "the rocket went kaput".
should have showed a picture of it for those who dont know what the upper stage is, when you start talking about its failure , because im thinking ur talking about the booster part that landed all throughout the end until you showed the debris from space. and try to breath.
no intro, no music, getting to the point instantly ?   no endless talking without saying anything ???      you got yourself a new subscriber!
Just stop wasting money you're a conman
ain't no breaking thru the firmament. Christ Jesus is in control. 33 is done
Megatron incomeing
Launch pad recapture looks amazing
This is how you get people to mars with SpaceX. They go up and then... They will reincarnate on mars :D
nice 😂😂😂😂😂
The name Starship for a reason ☄️☄️
I noted every second of this supposed flight and anything travelling 90,000M in 3.41 seconds is impossible doing sub 6000 miles per hour The max speed shown was 4400 kms an hour for a very brief time.
Wait for Trump to blame the Democrats
Practice crediting people from whom you got your footages. That's so unprofessional; you're literally stealing content.
🚀 spaceship hits the firmament
This is what cause your climate change!😅😅😅
Disassembly this is b*******. We have a failure. Just admit it. This is word salad to obfuscate a failure. Elon grow up
sure loses a load of speed between 70K alt and 80K alt, why is that?
Would have been great to see. Of course there will be set backs, my problem is the ridiculous idea that this thing is going to be the lunar lander, if we want to actually get back to the moon, NASA needs to contract for a real lunar lander, similar to the one we previously had
Explosion.  The term is explosion not RUD
Guess this sucker is not ready for prime time yet
Thanks Space X the dinner at Turks and Caicos became more special. lol
maybe too many changes.   but  as long as every bit of info you can get then its far easier to make good changes. Why would test  always go well.   every failure makes knowledge grow.
"Space Junk" from Devo
*Imagine China had a debris field like this*
There is no progress without failure.
Excellent! I didn't notice the flames were coming out in realtime and when they cut away from cameras and engines started shutting down I knew something was up. Thanks for the analysis!
so yesterday we had one proper launch, as one managed to go to orbit and the other recovered the first stage.
Some people don't have food to eat . Stop doing this thing and help people that will be more good in our short living time
What a joke this whole space race thing is, what do they ever think they are going to achieve, populate Mars! Ha Ha Ha by taking a handful of people at a time to Mars that takes years to get there.
Ominous omen for that Musk guy on what to expect in the next few years. "It may be dangerous to be Trump's (America's) enemy, but to be Trump's (America's) friend is fatal."
New subscriber here. May I COMPLIMENT you on your truly EXCELLENT commentary.  Clear, concise, factual speech, without hysterical & incorrect use of "we", as if to imply that the commentator was embedded with the rocket company!!!  I also watch Everyday Astronaut, WAI, Scott Manley, Marcus House, Nasa Spaceflight, Lab Padre.. those first two are COMPLETE idiots, whilst the rest all have one or more defficiencies... I will now consult YOUR channel FIRST, when getting my space news.  Well done! 😊
Can he send his mate up Don the Con on the next rocket.
So you can catch a Booster!! BIG DEAL! Let's see this flying stack of overpowered coffee cans put something meaningful INTO EARTH ORBIT!
How does a metal grate steer that thing? I bet its anti gravity 😮
"Rapid unscheduled disassembly"? That's one way to say "It blew uo."
New Glenn reached orbit on first attempt, Starshit failed on the seventh - It must be hard to be a SpaceX fanboy now 😢
And bro wants us to trust starship uber to go visit other planet's.
Elon needs more Indians on H1B visas to help build that rocket.  😂
You call em chopsticks, I call the labia
Why is there always this childish celebration? Shouldn't every scientist assume that it's normal for it to work? Or do people in the USA also cheer when the postman successfully delivers the mail? This is completely normal as his work is functioning well.
My my, if I hadn't seeen the WHOLE video, I would never have understood that this was a FAIL. Odd how BEFORE the launch, this was an amazing upgrade that would result in improved performance, & after, it was "Just a TEST." How careful everyone was not to say that the Starship blew up. I guess the Evil Genius wouldn't like that. Hope things go better when they launch off merrily to rescue those astronuats stranded on the Space Station. I have no faith that they'll ever return home.
Excellent report - immediately got a Subscribe.
Sabotage comes to mind.....
Gee SpaceX... just say it blew up... Rapid Unscheduled disassembly...!
Any film of Starship being blown up?
Someone else will say this God answer to ELON
Funny to hear SpaceX talk about 'rapid _unscheduled_ disassembly', as if there is such a thing as a 'scheduled' disassembly.
FlopShip.
Just glad there were no souls on the ship... The view reminded me of the shuttle break-up😢
Make sure to turn off your lights to save the planet guys! /s
Unscheduled disassembly lol
Well they dont show the Ship blowing up, too bad :!
Rapid dissassembly😅 blew up...like all the money Musk was given. Blown away
Excellent presentation.
"Unscheduled disassembled"  they say, instead "we fk-up, the ship exploded".... 🤣🤣🤣 delusional muppets, in real world, all media have big titles like Reuters here:  "SpaceX's Starship explodes in flight test,"
I don't know if every video feed was the same, but when I saw the lift off, there was a clear hole in the upper stage that shouldn't have been there. I don't know if it had anything to do with it breaking up, but as soon as I saw it, I thought there's gonna be a problem, and then there was one🤔
Just found another way to improve it.
All the astronaut's families will be reassured that at least they caught the booster.
its like a scene from your name
Ruddy impressive !!
Thanks for a well editted and concise summary of the flight. I'll note this channel in the future.
@1:22 we all saw the 'flappy' tearing away on the left hand of the screen.
*REMEMBER ITS A FLIGHT TEST*     OH I thought you were supposed to be landing people on the Moon this year - NASA paid you $4 Billion to land people on the MOON in 2025  Why are you still testing rockets Elon Ponzi when you have spent the US tax payers $4 billion...???
Putin sabotage! 😅
One day they will bring a banana into LEO! 🥸
Déjà Vu 🎉
A nice balanced reports, thanks for this. It's certainly a different way to test deployment of Starlink. Just strip the ship away from the test articles.
When Elon starts selling tickets to the public, I recommend booking a seat on the booster rather than the second stage.  Just sayin'.
no useful info. just stating what happened.
"8 astronauts were killed today, but we got our booster back!"
Mars, 2050.
Space pollution. Someone please go out and pick up the pieces.
It's all very primitive. Still not able to do a 100% lauch each time. We are still in the stone age erra....
It was very generous of Elon Musk to host the world's most expensive firework display to celebrate Trump's inauguration.  And as for this infatuation with travelling to live on a lifeless planet with little hope for any future - why doesn't he just return to LA - or any other American city run by a democrat administration.
SpaceXplode
Etkö pannut merkille Tähtilaivan metaanin (CH4) nopeaa vähenemistä?
I find the term Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly almost Orwellian for "Done Blew Up".
13k mph.... LOL....
Its never going to get to mars.
Cool Cgi bro
So no new information then😡
Definitely an explosion worth a 100million usd.
A potem będziecie płakać że są tornada ,pożary, powodzie zniszczycie świata
Sylwester2025, zniszczycie Ziemię
Im concerned about people in the company intentionally sabotageing the spaceship because they don't like Elon. You may think this is crazy but honestly this is where we are at now.
So, timing of views of the breakup show it didn't occur at engine shutdown or loss of signal, but rather a couple of minutes later. Scott Manley suggests this means the breakup was an activation of the flight termination system rather than a RUD. He also says that may need a review, as it actually increased the size and complexity of the debris field, and safety review might suggest it would be better in some stages for a stricken vessel to descend intact.
That was one expensive firework!
Technologically Starship still amazes me and is surely a Modern Wonder, baby steps.
There’s today a strange cult believing in private business and that the market will fix everything. The problem is that private business is profit motivated. And how to make profit from such a costly business like space travel? Well, you must save money. Everywhere, including security issues. Space X is one proof that market ideology doesn’t work. Boeing crashes is another, private railway systems in Europe shows the same problem. Deregulation and cutting costs on security gives very unsecure transports. Time to re-regulate everything that is of importance for society. Right wing cultists will cry, but just let them.
No dumb music over voice, visuals matched to the narrative, excellent informative content, concise.  Thank you. You are one of a handful of good creators on this subject.
Justin Trudeau is being brought in to investigate and make suggestions for future rockets.
Rapid Disassembly! I love it. I'm going to work that into my vocab.
Not losing faith. Mr.Musk has done more in the first few years of SpaceX then N.A.S.A has in their long existence. Well the shuttle was really bitchen,can't deny that.
قال الرب الواحد سبحانه وتعالى/ سنريهم آياتنا في الآفاق وفي أنفسهم حتى يتبين لهم أنه الحق أولم يكف بربك أنه على كل  شيء شهيد صدق الله العظيم وأوفى بوعده لليهود والنصارى
Will SpaceX still be celebrating failure when there are crew/passengers on board, just sayin.
The        Whole                    Thing                               *IS FAKE*
shooting star
SpaceX is going to get a slap in the neck. The flight termination system didn't blow the rocket up. It just broke up in the atmosphere fawk'n beautifully 🤩. Also it looked like with the engines going out one by one, it caused the ship to spin. You can see the rate of the spin increase by the speed indicator as each engine flames out.
Stop polluting our atmosphere that contribute climate change. Debris are so dangerous.
Teams will continue to review data  ? I thought Elon did this stuff all by himself. He gets help other than monetary help from the tax payer ? Well blow me down.
Brilliant summary of test flight 7. Thank you!
"A rapid unscheduled disassembly".  Only a saffer could murder the English language like that.
I really hope Starship will keep failing. What a horrible company.
This time the fireworks display was the most spectacular!
Killer content man. Such a great recap!
booster catch not make my D**k hard. it allready landed many time acurate on cross. even moving boat. its easy to grab it when it hover. i waiting mars unmanned 2024... wait not even moon
No new info here. Next!
at least they got the booster back!
Lawsuits incomingggg.! Airlines & passengers. It was funny watching air traffic scatter on Flight Radar.
To quote top gear: “how are you going to re-use that!?” Anyhow, amazing launch, catch and test. Looking forward to that sweet spot of best configuration.  Love the video. As mentioned by someone else. Good signal-to-noise ratio! ❤
Remember the same junky Starship blew up on the launch pad last summer ...
musks firework factory  continues unabated. I trust that all this environmental pollution is to some purpose?
Bad start to 2025 + LA fires. Daam
Expensive fireworks!
Looks the same as Saturday, February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere over Texas and Louisiana
Rookie mistake, next time do double check for leaks
Not a good result for Elon the fascist, rapist and fraudster lover. SO much for the bs about "...blah blah multiplanetary".😂😂😂
With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability."  What a joke.  Improving reliability by exploding another rocket.  And who can fail at any task given that as one's credo?  Failure is success!    And sounds like almost everything about it is new.  Why not get it right first?  Why hasn't V1 met the spec?  Why is a V2 needed to fulfil the spec?  If V1 had been up to snuff there wouldn't need be a V2, let alone V3.  Musk has the nerve to sell all this as success.
Lots of techie BS. Nice...
I feel sorry for the trained camera chimp who burned up in the re-entry.
What excatly happened was that Elon Musk braodcast his fraud and incompetence, yet again. $USD3Billion later and this clown can't even get a rocket into orbit, less a human. He promised that humans would have a colony on Mars by 2022. Where  is it? Where are my tesla solar roof panels? They don't exist. They never did.  MUSK IS A FRAUD. Gaol him now.
I seen a tile flopping around on takeoff ! But the crash of starship was a bullet dodged luckily it didn’t land on people or homes ! Even more so no astronauts aboard! The booster catching of the booster !! 🫡
Looks like someone shot it out of the sky
You didn't cover isro docking mission???
Rapid disassembly? Sounds like a crash to me!
What if people was on board  Going to mars or moon ?
SO SPACE IS A CARTOON
Is nobody concerned about the amount of space junk that #spacex is leaving out there?
Where did the debris land geographically?
I wait for an unscheduled decommission of Elon.
At right around 8 minutes, the CH4 level starts dropping really fast. Is that an indicator that the tank was somehow damaged at that point?
Best fireworks ever!
nobody even cares about the pollution
One way or the other, SpaceX puts on a great show.
......................BUT didn't the yanks land a bunch of men with dune buggies, golf sticks, video cameras, air conditioning, etc, etc. on the moon, and then return them safely, in the Apollo missions. That was 60+ years ago. What happened? :D
“C’mon guys, so much oodles and doodles of data, and our engineers warned us to not launch”, SpaceX after 7 failed launches
Artemis is scheduled for a Sept 2026 Lunar landing.  This is the platform for the landing system?  they still have not been able to successfully orbit the Earth.  Maybe someone should evaluate the efficiency of the Starship program's government funding.
Imagine being in a boat and all of a sudden a rocket enging drops on your boat 😮😅
I'd love to know how much Blue Origin has cost, vs how much SpaceX has cost, and how much govt funding both have received. I'm not entirely sure the 'move fast and break things' philosophy works for rockets and the recent success of the New Glen rocket kinda proves the point. Fortunately, Musk has the presidents ear, so he's safe for now.
Hey fellow US TAXpayers  lets give eloy another $ 3 BIL even though LA is burning DOWN.
Unscheduled disassembly. I need to add that term to my vocabulary.
*YET another FAILURE*
kimi no namae wa????
FAA will probably want to ground the ship for a bit truth is only SLS is mature enough to get American back to the moon to meet its own timeline at this point
The Starship only blew up because Elon is pushing the limits! .....and this proves it! Keep On Rocketing!
I guess it was planned in order to collect data. Right?
lies and propaganda. this is either an explosion on the dome or spiritual warfare.
Looks like Elon's business model is blowing up.
The most expensive firework display ever.
Gonna drop some thoughts. 1.) Starship seems overdesigned. More engines = more potential bombs, more parts = more potential failures. I like Elon in a lot of ways, but his ego seems to play heavily into this design philosophy. I don't think this is optimal, and I'm concerned for the future when people's lives will be lost. 2.) SpaceX using the phrase "Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly" belies the seriousness of these events. These rockets are designed to soon carry people. Joking around about this disaster makes me lose confidence in their entire company. 3.) Given the toxic, partisan political climate we live in, and with Elon now aligning with one side, it makes me wonder if hard-left people in his organization might actually be sabotaging. They would.
“Unscheduled dissassembly” The use of language elements is astonishing, almost as important as the related events.
wow expensive fireworks show thanks Elon,
Best RUD so far
No bananas were hurt in this test….
Space equivalent of cybertruck? Best wishes for successful next launch.
Those two engines cut too early, sent the ship into a tumble, where it eventually broke up.
Good post.
During launch you can see on the top left of the nose that starship started to lose insulation tiles
Schadenfreude
When I saw this, I thought it was another space shuttle Columbia video.
At least it's a test mission. It wasn't a manned mission to try out systems. They will figure it out. These are the missions you want to see the problems appearing.
Why has he called it V2? Symbolism is important to humans. Musk knows fell well what the V2 is..... scary.
Direct and to the point. Great job!  Sincerely, a new subscriber!
Thanks for a great no nonsence vidieo - Facts and straight to the point - Appreciate that man!! Great Video!!
The ISS will look something like this in a few years, think its worth it to watch
No government funding to this space garbage.
Ship experienced energetic disassembly! 😢
Was this the one carrying  the moon mission i saw somewhere  space x was sending something  to the moon
The chopstick landing is cool. But what problem dose that solve? We already landed rockets in the ocean. Worked fine. Weren't these supposed to be rapid reusable? Well? So far it months between launches or should I say fire works display.
It looks like we took a step backwards in terms of design and technology, sorry not sorry Elon. At least design it to look better and not a giant soup can with wings.
When I see the space X achievements, I feel man kind is moving forward now.
"A hundred mistakes can lead achievement"  Same as Falcon Same as Falcon Heavy Same as Dragon Capsule  Behind success was the will to continue after making a hundred failures!
3 billion tax payer dollars and Space X hasn't even got a pay load to orbit yet. NASA put a rover and helicopter on Mars of 2.5 billion.
A rud.  What
If NASA had this many failures people would be dragged in front of congress and loss their jobs. Elon dose it and he is the co-president.
I saw that hole live.. I was thinking “what is that hole? Is that supposed to be like that?”  Crazy..
Calling a catastrophic failure of the vehicle a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" will never not be funny to me. SpaceX are doing some amazing stuff, but their PR department is being run by absolute lemons.
Very good information. Utterly free from padding or hyperbole. The AI voice fitted this dry and factual delivery perfectly.
Elon Musk's way of celebrating Guy   Fawkes!
Why at 5:53, i can see certain lights/fragments flying in the opposite direction of everything else, and they are maneuvering extremely quickly... like UAP's.... Perhaps its a lens reflection or something?  I think it might be that... as there are a group of them moving identically...
The constant commercial interruption  of this video prevents me from subscribing. I might as well be watching a PGA golf tournament...
Starship needs some tweaks but wow another catch like clockwork my admiration for everyone who made it happen I thank you
Good commentary.
Whoever doesn't want Elon near government is the threat lol
I'm gonna need this in high resolution for my background. Just amazing.
This is really bad. SpaceX needs an overhaul and change to its FIFI culture and processes. Blowing up boosters,  launch pads, etc is one thing. Orbitals over people and countries is another. Not as “expendable”.
I knew the malfunction was a fuel leak a few minutes after it had happened by looking at how the engines were shut down.
Nice fireworks Musk...bravo!!!
This is really bad. SpaceX needs an overhaul and change to its FIFI culture and processes. Blowing up boosters,  launch pads, etc is one thing. Orbitals over people and countries is another.
I feel like people are downplaying the severity of the Starships breakup. If that was happening on year 3 of Chinese rockets people would be having a very different opinion. It is dangerous no matter how you look at it and honestly shouldn’t be acceptable. It’s an environmental cost and cold be a life factor cost as well  if it went into an airline, people on the ground or in water. You can’t warn everyone down range of a disaster like this.
What a joke 7 launches 6 vehicles and still hasn't made it to orbit ,Nasa launched 1 rocket made it to orbit but lost the booster, he wantS to refuel in space there saying it could take up to 12 rockets to get to the moon for refueling just doesn't make sense.
What was the piece of metal hanging from the rocket, you could see it on the left of the camera 🤔
Excellent detail and assembly of pertinent videos and data. Well done. Thanks.
Waaaaayyy cooler than fireworks.
Maybe Elon should stop playing video games, or pretending too, and focus on what’s important
Turks and Caicos: "Uh, we found your Starship"
This is called Karma … Karma is a B**ch … Elon used to make fun of boeing! 😂
how is having not a single starship come back to the earth whole a "step in the right direction"? Why did he blow up all the ones that splashed done instead of recovering them and seeing if they could be used again like they would be or at least should be..  There are a lot of questions that need to be asked about the viability of his "program" when it seems to waist so much needlessly or is the waist just to cover up the money he is stealing????
That ring is gnarly.
I was bothered by the acceleration of the Starship compared to the rate of fuel consumed.  I don’t know what the planned final velocity was, but it looked like the fuel load was nowhere near enough to reach orbital speed.  Huge leak ongoing in the spacecraft?
We are in the Wright brothers stage before we move into The Expanse.
"rapid unscheduled disassembly"? who are you kidding Space-X!  IT EXPLODED!!
Subbed man! Awesome vid!
That's an expensive way to burst firecracker in the sky
It's not the angle,  Or the dangle, Nor the sag of the bag, But the throb, Of the knob, That does the Job.
Why is this program so different than getting humans to the space station?
What a great show.. expensive fireworks
That's a beautiful albeit very expensive meteor shower...
A hollow tube with 50 engines.  Seems pre-historic.  Would you actually envision flying on anything close to that?
The debris footage is GORGEOUS ❤
Failures will always happen. This is why we test, test, test and test again. Space flight will become commonplace but we will still have losses and losses of life. You cannot make safety zero.
Ground Control to Major Tom, sending prototype stainless steel cans & failing orbit testing failure rate seems to have been made an acceptable risk now due to the culture.  Failure usually is a top driven issue in organizations, project managers over-ruling engineers is my guess. Just sayin, a shake up is needed.
Looks like a Hollywood FX.
That RUD was beautiful!!
The only thing that is going to be traveling through space is robots and machines. Human beings aren't going anywhere...
SpaceX puts on a much better show than blue origin.
Another Space-X "success!"  By now, anyone who still believes that this thing is ever going to the MOON (LOL!) or MARS (LOLOLOLOL!) is delusional.  The only thing this Musk vanity project (and colossal waste of American taxpayer funds) does reliably is BLOW UP or fail in some other unique way.  This thing is highly unlikely to ever get beyond Earth orbit (which it has yet to achieve) and is NEVER, I repeat, NEVER going to Mars.  Catching the booster is a neat trick, but it is a variation of an achievement first accomplished about 20 years ago, and is hardly worth the BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars which have been LITERALLY BURNED UP by Musk, our new "expert" on how to trim government waste!  Welcome to our ongoing American DYSTOPIA/OLIGARCHY!
At the turks right now and I will tell you that was some light show
crazy that recovering a booster that big is becoming the expected outcome.  a year ago, nobody thought catching it would even be possible.
Nobody burns tax dollars faster than Elon.
So, is it safe to assume that one there was a LOS it self destructed, or was it a true propulsion induced explosi9n?
As Elon Musk said, ' No innovation without failures..
We have an old "rule" in Drag Racing that we go by (well, most of us anyway).... and that is.. "Make Only One change at a time.. if it doesn't improve anything, put it back to what it originally was, then try the next change... keep Only the changes, that improve performance... One at a Time".    Moral of the story is... if you make too many changes at once, and it "goes south" on you.... then you waste precious time and money trying figure out which change or changes, caused the downgrading of performance.... or, as in this case..."a complete Disassembly"    Are you Listening... Elon?
If this were the upper stage of China's CZ-5B rocket, even though it's only 20 tons—less than 1/50th of Starship—everyone would surely find it extremely dangerous, right?
There was a metal piece flapping outward from starship during the ascend. It clearly see that on one of the side cam. That could be the main culprit of the problem
Sudden unscheduled disassembly...indeed.
When will people realise that starship is not practical and will always just be good as a spectacle? Its good to dream but its better to understand physics too. Am not sure why Elon cant see it or maybe its a grift, only time will tell
Not Turks & Caicos 🇹🇨 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
even when its out the pressure area where its basically zero psi the plume is still never effected by rotation even tho theres a massive transition from a pressured system rotating 1000mph to nothingness...18km high and the plume is plum straight down 😂. 60km and completely out the atmosphere with zero % of earths spin torque passed to the rocket yet its stationary in relation to cloud system below that should be rotating +1000mph ..
This is a sign of whats to come for America with President Must and Vice president Trump isolating America, destroying our alliances around the world and complementing our adversaries..madness but music to the ears of our enimies!
Beautiful yet very expensive firework.
I hope some flat earthers watched those images!!!
Si se me hizo raro verla hecha pedazos, ya que supuestamente esta diseñada para soportar el calor de la reentrada aun sin partes del escudo térmico, y pues parece que fue una explosión la que la fragmento
Ок . Напоминает  самый первый сход с орбиты , станции , которая  была хорошая . Можно говорить всё что угодно . Никогда амерам не быть на луне  и марсе  . Утрите слёзы и и идите спать . 😊
A rapid unexpected disassembling of the upper section  ? In normal language that means it blew the fuck up  !  Just another day in the life of Elon  🇺🇲
It blew up, just like the U.S. is.
"Rapid unscheduled disassembly". 🤣 Dangit. But that was explanation was funny.
Exactly the answer I was looking for.
Just more junk .
Is it supposed to do that? 😂🎉
There's hope.
Where did it splashdown?
Fire in space?
Rapid unscheduled disassembly = it blew up!
Very nice informative update. Well done! Thank you for sharing.
Whenever a Starship launch doesn’t go as planned and it explodes, an angel gets his wings.👍
yeah, you wont ever catch me on one of these
Really well done vid. Subbed
Elon sure knows how to have great fire works shows
the booster is looking good. this system is going to be solid and have just as much reliability as falcon.
The destroyed starship looked like an "end of the world" type senario
Sandra Bullock Survived And Gave Us an Amazing Story.
We've only had liquid fuel rockets since the 40s.  They'll get it. Eventually.
At least that lgihtshow was beautiful haha
What happened was we wasted massive amounts of tax dollars on a fraudster who built a rocket that can never be man rated. He was supposed to be testing a working moon lander this year. They did it with slide rules in the 60s, but Musk cant get into orbit with all  his resources. Ditch musk and start over.
Spacebucket lookin pail😮
LOL, the front fell off.  Try again Musky Boy. Remember when he said they'd be on Mars by 2022.  Guy's a complete dill.
Detailed Data is The most valueable part of any flight testing.   SpaceX will always bounce back stronger.
Some one sabotage
Yo if this were NASA or BLUE ORIGIN  It would be YEARS at least  Before we saw a next launch and test  Meanwhile ELON is like hmm... Interesting  On to the next one
why does it matter we'll be gone in 80yrs ..is that why they're eager to train up Indians who aren't going extinct 😂🤷‍♂️ ..
A stunt can conceal & who needs advertising when you can provide the greatest show over earth
The new term for BLEWUP!
That was a battery. Nowadays it is not a surprise if battery is just a half way battery.
Russians sent 100s of rockets WITH people to space over 70 years ago and Musk and his gang still blowing up ships on "testing".   This is not very different than Stockton Rush clown, just on a larger scale.
hay elon. and gwen,you might want to double,triple check production security,just sayin.
200 tons of extra fuel.... A lot more strain on the engines and pressure tanks
Thanks for providing such a concise summary of the launch and what followed
good work here i was wondering how it went thx 🎉
"rapid unscheduled disassembly". LMAO. It effing blew up!. just say it as it is.
More like CRUD.  “Catastrophic” is an important adjective.  This is not the way to do engineering    SpaceX was contracted to be on the moon by now, and they can’t even reach orbit.  Starship, as a concept, has failed. It was not designed well, and it has not been constructed well.  It needs to die so Falcon might at least live.
Excellent presentation. Please keep up the great work.
Neglected the CH4 leaking in the bar graph bottom right of screen.
with respect, but the falling & burning debris looks exactly same from meteor shower in Andor
Yep, every RUD is a valuable learning experience -- but only while not losing valuable payloads or, in future, crew (if and when Starship ever gets man-rated). I can't see NASA's Artemis III lunar landing  happening any time soon, since it went with the SpaceX Starship HLS as the one and only 'lowest bidder' option. The original 'tentative' goal of Artemis III landing using Starship HLS was for 2026. Last Dec NASA deferred this target to mid-2027 (largely due to mismatch between required HLS milestones and actual progress to date), and this RUD will most likely see Artemis III either deferred further into the future, or maybe a backup HLS provider contract sought (but funding isn't available), or maybe the whole Artemis project scrapped (Trump and Elon are more interested in a fantasy trip to Mars asap, than any realistic but 'been there, done that' lunar landing project that will be seen as just a redo of Apollo half a century after the original). On a positive note, the lunar gateway may end up being ready before Starship HLS starts testing things like in-orbit refuelling...
No banana split for you tonight!  But seriously; yeah fElon, just keep throwing crap in the air and calling it cute names like "rapid unintended disassembly."  You probably aren't old enough to remember when space flight wasn't treated as a football game.  We watched in awe while serious people realized they were taking serious risks!  Someday you aren't going to be so lucky and a lot of people could be hurt.  That's why real rocket scientists put launch facilities at Cape Canaveral, Vandenberg and Guiana.  But hey, you can run SpaceX, Tesla, the Boring Co., and DOGE, all at once right?  What did you say about the "Hyperloop" once?  "It's like an air hockey table in a [vacuum] tube.  It's really not that hard!"  I would say that you might want to reconsider that statement in general, a lot of things are harder than you thought they were.
Spacex makes the best fireworks
That debris was filmed over land. Very much reminiscent of the Columbia tragedy. Hopefully none of the pieces actually came down over land, although they certainly could have since Starship was completely out of control. There was obviously a hole in the side of the Starship vehicle clearly visible right after launch. Hopefully there will be a very long and thorough investigation after this catastrophic failure. Lives on the ground could have easily been lost.
Horrible AI voice. Had to slow it down. These flights are all experimental, so it's not that strange that something fails once in a while. This is clearly not a finished project!
The lower-stage landing doesn't mean anything if the rocket blows up, again. How many failures is this now?
It looks to me like a repair patch failed. You can see the corner of a narrow steel plate flutter in the air or fluttering from air or gas exiting from inside the rocket. The video I saw didn't show the explosion but shut off moments before the breakup occurred.
7 out of 7 failed flights from Musks Starship! ........pathetic! if this was Apollo project their 6th flight landed on the moon it was called Apollo 11.🤣
Just remember, the furthest Space X has flown is only 870 miles away from Earth. The moon is 238,855 miles away from Earth. I encourage everyone to fact check this. Musk can't even get to the moon much less Mars.
So Space X hid the footage of it BLOWING UP.....  cover up...
it looks like andor
Looks like the Aldani Eye from Andor
Elon it's time to dial it in. Quit making so many changes. It's hard i know.  Just stick with what works. Great flight.
Progress is so slow.
That debris reentering was way cooler than yet another splashdown, tbqh.
STARSHIP V2 An easter egg harkens to a more violent time
The original marketing claim was to so much cheaper than the shuttle, but of course Spacex compared their estimated operational costs versus the total development costs of the shuttle.  Doesn't look too hopeful for their math to work out for 'rapidly reusable' when 100% have failed to return in anything remotely salvageable.
No Black box to find on THIS one...🙂
At least a human didn't suffer a "rapid unscheduled disassembly"!
Piece of junk blows up what a surprise
Musk wanna be oligarch just lost billions and a lot of credibility with trump who doesn't want losers on his team!
Risk/ Reward.  These things are going to happen.
Jebediah Kerman will be remembered
Rapid unscheduled disassembly, lol
Very honest of Mr Musk and Space X officials. However, not very enviromentally friendly! I guess thats the price we oay for spreading our hate, greed, intolance, and wars, to another planet! How about fixing this one FIRST, Elon!🙏🙏
Damn thing blew up. Next one have elon muskrat onboard.
Wasn't Spectrum Much busy at the time debating a content creator about just how mightily mighty he is at playing make believe about his video game prowess?? I dare you Elmo Tusk, pilot the next mission.
Well explained. I think you covered everything down to the tee. I'd agree and say to many bells and whistles were added to ship. I think maybe indirect pressure from N.A.S.A and the competition contributed to Space X doing to much on this one. The schedule and dates that  NASA has put out to the public and media is turning up the heat on everyone they have contracts with. Smh. Looking like 2030 moon. And maybe 2050 or something for Mars.
Doesn’t matter if it’s designed for sending immigrants to Mars.
Great video. My first time here and I just subscribed..
The re-entry of Starship was a lot like in Star Trek 3 when the Enterprise re-entered the atmosphere over the planet Genesis... I can even hear the music in my head it was an incredibly similar appearance.
Maybe in the future they will get that booster to come straight down before the catch instead of looking like its searching for the tower
WAY TO MANY ADS IN YOUR VIDEO
How could this have happened and how are we going to blame the woke libs?
Bro got this out so fast and so well put together I'm starting to suspect he was in it 🤔🤔🤣
This is what certain world war 2 country did in a submarine by flushing out oil and debris out a torpedo tube to fool the destroyer on the surface…..
What was the payload that they were planning on deploying with Starship?
Now THAT was one expensive fireworks show...
Question: wasn't there a valuable payload on the ship? Lunar lander, satellites, etc?
If only governments would monitor analyse and correct the policies and laws they put into place in this way. Plenty of them are cluster fcuks like this but no corrective action is taken
An amazing recovery! Hopefully China doesn’t steal it…
Root cause: it is a trial-and-error rocket development program.
There shouldn't be leaks like this occurring on the 7th flight. This is a terrible outcome.
Starship decided to shoot some stars, 🌝
It blew up you losers. Wake up.
Normal people: another Starship failure Musk Cult: Wow that was so cool!!!!
chop sticks what are they thinking
A RUD? Nah, it exploded lol.
Jeff who😂
“Major improvements” all failed. This never happened in the space race. We reached the moon with Zero explosions like this. The catch of the booster is a distraction. This pissing away of our money is why Elon said before the election, “If Trump isn’t elected. “I’m fucked.”
Maybe they should go back in time and build Apollo  rockets . They don't seem to build anything better   that will work. . May God bless everyone 🙏 ❤
An altimeter won’t work in Space. Wrap your head around that.
I guess for SpaceX seven was not a lucky number.
Aside from the gimmick of recovering the first (least expensive) stage, this is 1960s technology so I’m a little surprised with the failures.   At least Elon was able to tweet what his engineers told him to say.
What a proud bunch of imbeciles us Americans have become. Of course, im much worse than the imbeciles i speak of, I'm sure
Rapid unscheduled disassembly?? How many millions were pulverised per pop so far??? Yeah, Space X is quite ready for that Mars trip (in its alternate Universe.), eh???  Let's to put Elon on the next flight!  😛
Another Success!
So, the bullshit term for an explosion is a thing now? How about calling things what they are?
Why can’t SpaceX do what NASA did 62 years ago? Blue origin’s recent launch didn’t explode. They didn’t recover their booster, but people wouldn’t be in the booster. People should realize that SpaceX hasn’t even accomplished what the Nazis did in WWII.
The Cybertruck of SpaceX.
Maybe someone forgot to add a couple anti vibration clamps on that new plumbing..
Excellent recap.
Trump will make sure the FAA investigation never happens
This is turley a succsseor to the N1
are we sure there wasn't just a cybertruck parked nearby?
that debris passing through the atmosphere is beautiful
Good summary... no beating around the bush,  just precise info matched with visuals.  Well done. 😎🇦🇺
llololololololololololololololololol. total upgrade
Unscheduled disassembly=🚀💥
The Starship get its brain scrambled by Twitter ahem X? Seems to be a pattern.
look honey there goes a waste of tax dollars!
First rule of drag racing. only change one thing at a time.
Really solid video. Well done
Amazing how quickly you've managed to make such a well produced and informative video. Well done.
Thank you that was well explained
Great job, SpaceХ
What if??? It’s still up there, but it just jettisoned something to look like it crashed back to earth. It could be up there on a secret mission. Hint, hint 😅
Starship is already a failure but SpaceX wants to make us believe that nice 4K footage is a better reward than mission success. But now there's SLS and New Glenn. It becomes increasingly hard to sell mission failures as success while others go orbital.
The fires of starship
Not being afraid to appear to fail is admirable.  Great work space x
i guess it shared components with the cyber truck?
Luckily we have all of the teslas to offset the emissions from these rocket launches.
That RUD created all kinds of mess for Miami Air Traffic Control Center and caused a bunch of reroutes and diversions of airliners and other aircraft flying over the Caribbean. Although cool looking, those break ups over busy airspace can be dangerous.
There goes mars-a-lago.
Very fine reporting!! Thanks.🚀🚀
5:30 so... This is what all those sci fi ship battles in low earth orbit I read about would ACTUALLY look like. Terrifying... Imagine full fleets duking it out at those speeds, all different orbital trajectories.....ordinance....    Wow.
Explosive gas rocketry is barbaric and there are many better options. I think it's clear everything from Elon Musk is an elaborate breeding scheme of some sort. I was flying reusable rockets in the 90s and I had satellite internet in the 2000s. I would not get in this guy's spaceship.   I would panic if you haven't gone to Mars in 300 years. But rushing with explosive gas is foolish.
Huge amount of taxpayers' money being burnt in these fancy fireworks by Elon.
RUD = R U Delusional  as God will send a great Delusion for the Delusional in the climate change last days.
When it is successful at once, it wants bigger than retest, again and again, like a loop. The end seems like moving a new step, infact never move a step to start any project in the space. Chinese/china's mindset is the other way round, used whatever has successed and start building base at the space. Quantity wins
Obviously not all of those “improvements” were improvements!
Built like a tesla.
Thank you for GETTING TO THE POINT QUICKLY.  Much appreciate the high signal-to-noise ratio of this video!
Yet again this Ponzi scheme saves the dumb booster but the bit that's supposed to carry humans can't even get a banana to orbit and is destroyed (again) Saturn V, designed using slide rules put men on the moon on its 6th launch in 1969. Let that sink in
What will they call it when they lose a crew ?!  R.U.R.T.C.B.M. !  RAPID UNSCHEDULED RETURN TO CARBON-BASED MATTER !
Remember last Summer when Donald Trump had an unscheduled ballistic projectile encounter?
*Elon:* "My toy is BETTER than yours, *Jeff."*
Spaceship has blown up a lot of engines trying to be reusable. Wouldn't it be cheaper to not to try to land them and just use them to launch satellites? They must have blown up at least 200 engines by now.
Without question... Starship 7's reentry was a beautiful event
Y is it all I'm thinking about is the heat tiles flying back not burning up... hope it was water bound..
"Major improvements in reliability and performance." Lol. Sure.
Unfortunately it reminds my wife of the Columbia Shuttle disaster which we observed live while walking in SoCal in 2003.😂
The ship was hit by one of them there alien plasmatic orbs we keep seeing over Jersey 🛸👽🛸👽🛸👽🛸👽🪩🪩🪩
Maybe too many changes as it might make diagnosis more difficult?  Easy for me to say *now* of course...
Mr Musk is Genius Rocket Man!!!,,,he will correct rocket engineering no doubt!!! ;))
When they lost the last sea level engines they lost gimbal control. The one vacuum engine still firing would have caused the craft to spin. The vehicle then probably automatically activated the flight termination system as the vehicle was too far outside the expected flight path.
“It blowed up, sir!”
Good thing Elon is the President…SpaceX should cruise through the upcoming investigations at light speed.
Still can't even reach orbit after 7 flights and 3 billion dollars!!!   And no payload except a banana!   What a success!!!
Fact is Bezos dont have the Rockets, Mr Musk has got,,,Bezos is BS!!!,,,never know space at all!!! ;))
I hope they find the black box. 😂
Rocket launch DOGE style.
BOOM! Happened.
Here's a curious question.. Is it physically possible to say "Max Q" (the moment of peak mechanical stress on the rocket) without explaining what it means in the same sentence? I'm not sure science has ever witnessed such a monumental event.
Beautiful Fireworks!
Imagine if any other company was to dump 220,000lb of trash into the Caribbean. I hope they get fined for the environmental impact. But then again I understand that pollution by large globalist corporations is not the problem. Only cows farting and people trying to keep warm in winter is the problem.
Any way to find out if it was sabotage from at outside source? New Glen lost communication too, just strange.
Mr Musk is Genius Rocket Man!!!,,,he will correct rocket engineering no doubt!!! ;))
I'm a huge fan, but what an absolute embarrassment to lose that ship.
50/50!  Caught the booster, lost the ship. Last time lost the booster, landed the ship.  When they have both, it’s Go Time!
Yep the part of the ship that was to be a CREW ship - disintegrated.
And people worry about global warming.   DA!
Another sign of a failed Biden administration.  Next flight will won't be licensed by a woke FAA. [satire]
This guy Besos tell me , is he  a clown??? ;))
Best coverage yet! Great details on the two stages and the problems!
With this kind of success, we'll be on the Moon in no time.
The idea is to discover all of the flaws in the vehicle during the test stage. So, a flaw was detected and no doubt it will corrected before the next flight. Great job SpaceX!
Besos as not as tech as SpaceX,,,SpaceX daring!!!,,something Besos dont have nothing to show!!! ;))
It exploded like a Tesla!
Leadership is distracted ruining the country. 🤷‍♂️
And that is why NASA freezes a design at some point. And once the design is frozen and certified, any modifications to the booster or vehicle needs to be recertified. There is no way to be certain what unintended consequences might ensue  when you change stuff in a space vehicle.
Great review!
What a waste of resources.
Saturn V was developed in the 1960s and had 13 launches in total with no failures; the 3d launch was already crewed. Starship had 7 'test' launches; none even made it to orbit or had any meaningful cargo.
World-class expensive fireworks display!  Another huge step closer to going to Mars!
Oh, there's your problem - upper stage debris.  Where is SpaceX vs the actual flight schedule that is in the contract with NASA (i.e. the American taxpayers)?
wonder if the RUD debris  landed near any boats in the water..
SpaceX sucks!!! F the muskrat!!!
Geez. YouTube has suddenly increased the number of ads in your short video to truly annoying levels. Looking at the Starship debris entering the atmosphere over the ocean reminds me of the Shuttle disaster. Once again it reminds me how Elon and SpaceX had better create another version of Starship specifically for crew, without payload. The payload could be replaced by the equipment to make crew ejection or nose cone ejection possible with recovery systems as well, so you could recover the humans at all stages of the flight. There is no way they should strap a crew into seats directly over the Second Stage Fuel Tank bulkhead no matter how many successful flights they have. The Space Shuttle only had a RUD every 100 flights or so. And no one calls that acceptable.
Look at the fuel gauges... Ship had a methane leak. Basically farted it self to death.
Great recap, factual and concise.  Thank you.
Nice fail safes and redundancy for the v2. Good grief.
Well, it was a lose part of fuselage on the launch, very obvio something was going to be wrong on re-entry, it didn’t even make it.
SpaceX continues to learn that safety cant be cut.  How many ships have been lost or severly damaged?  Them rediscovering the need for a water deluge system.  Doesnt have the fuel to achieve LEO with a payload.
60 years ago, the rocket technologie in the USA, was much safer and better, due to the paperclip project ?
I guess they missed the reliability part.
Just putting junk in the atmosphere
Now I’m thinking about flight 8 :) well it might take a while
The Musk haters have new ammo.
Good summary. New subscriber.
Please put me on the next one
RUD of the Centuries
The most distressing thing about the explosion is that Musk wasn't on board.
🚀 💥 🤯
Let's all hope that New Glenn has a better return.
Totally expected. Felon Musk is a fraud at EVERYTHING,  even video games, and there's no shortcut he isn't willing to take.
“… a rapid unscheduled disassembly…” I hope Elon directs the SpaceX leaders to use plain English rather than governmental buzz-speak!  Suggested replacement ”the darmned thing, she went Boom!”
Looks like Thunderfoot is right 😂
IFT8 same booster new ship 0 problems. I’m betting $1000
Couple more of these and Elon Musk will be titled as "Formerly .................... the richest man in the world."
Why? Glad it's his money. 😂
How about moving out of Maralago and get to SpaceX and fix your rockets
upgrades made a step backwards, didn't even make it! prev versions had landed in the ocean. Terrible
Thanks For The Great Coverage
Why do they jettison the ring
based on what engines were lost in the data we have already, It probably would have entered a spin from a skewed thrust so that may have something to do with it all.
RUD needs to be retired. Your ship blew up. Own it.
Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly...... a nice way to say it Blew Up!!
Rest in pieces!
The FFA is going to have a field day with this
This was a complete disassembly of the rocket as they said based on the video of the numerous pieces seen burning across the heavens.  That would have been a spectacular sight had it happened at night.
i was watching live from Australia and saw the first engine flame out then the flame in the hinge joint of the main flap then fuel level were dropping. I know it wasn't going to be long... i was just wondering if the flight path was over me in Australia lol
Flight 7 and no loads no orbitals , ...scam
Oh so it did just explode
Haha elon 🤣
Starship top blows up looks like shooting stars.
"FOUR"!
What was this carrying? WHOSE  cargo/money was just wasted??
thank you
Helldivers
"rapid unscheduled disassembly"
Starship Block Twoops
it got shot down
Great video
As SpaceX was wondering, what happened to their ship, I was going to X and seeing recently posted videos of what actually did happen to their ship.
MAN'S LOVE OF FLIGHT PAST & NOW ** Man has dreamed of flying high Since birds first avoided his spear. Not until nineteen-o-three Was it done despite his fear.  With gasoline and engine, Propellers and wings for lift The Wright brothers flew their plane And gave mankind their gift.  Many countries built their planes As our world became insane. Planes were used in two world wars With bombs and bullets to rain.  Now we fly in outer space In search of life's creation. Though most succeed, some will die Pioneers of aviation.  Nothing else man can conceive Is more luring but God's sky. To be as one with the stars Is the wish of all who fly.  By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web!
When in the flight did the upper stage explode
Elon, the 4th of July is still a few months away!
"RUD" is a euphemism for catastrophic explosion?
Just a reminder that Starship was supposed to be making regular landings on Mars by now, according to the timeline Musk sold to NASA. And SpaceX has since blown the entire budget.
Would have been great if everything had worked perfectly, but still a very impressive launch and flight. The recovery of the booster into the cradle will never get old to watch.  Look forward to hearing the details of what happened to the ship when they become available.  Great video report as usual, really enjoying the work being done by TheSpaceBucket channel in covering these events!
Thank you for that quick update. Helped to answer some of the questions in my head.
I can't help but feel like this *could* be SpaceX's own Colombia considering the breakup and the risk to at least 6 nearby aircraft. (By pure coincidence, they even share the same launch date) I would not be surprised if they had a 6 month grounding, bare minimum 3 months.
Would be nice if the haters had something else to put down besides their fat mouthes.
Another truly epic launch and recovery, too bad about Starship but they'll figure it out. Thanks for the update. 👍👍
When catching a skyscraper with giant chopsticks is the *easy* part...  Also, that's one heck of a shotgun.
Cancel musks gov't contracts today
Not much progress since flight 5.  Bezos already in orbit.  Ha!
Booster still had plenty of fuel left,,they are only going to get better at that,,
Looks like the U. S. S. Enterprise entering the Genesis planet’s atmosphere…
ShOcK & AWE  If you aren't hyperventilating watching this (even repeatedly) please call 911  It's possible you may be dead   It's all so fricking fantastic... Just saying    TSP, thank you for bringing this un-hyped information to us. It's true what people are saying; You do RoCk!
Catching the booster means nothing if the ship explodes. How many more years until this happens?
Starship does not work. It needs to be cancelled ASASP before one more penny of taxpayer money is spent, and God forbid, any human lives are lost.
It’s going to delay SpaceX for months I reckon
looks like he forgot autostruts lol
As with any other failure of human organizational efforts; Someone there knows what happened because they said it would happen, but did what they were told anyway. And right now they’re tired of being right 😂
Elon also just tweeted saying, "Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area. Nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month."
I mean the explosion did look cool tho
