Goes to show you, without a QB you are in big trouble.  NFC championship game, 49ers no QB lost, with a QB won. Purdy is better than the media admits.
This is why I dont respect Jalen Hurts playoff run!
Absolutely dominated both Philly and Dallas last year!!!! Best wins of the season. 49ers run the NFC
I just came back to this but trusting Dak MORE than Purdy is WILDDDDD
So glad the 49ers lost the Super Bowl. All this means nothing
Purdy was playing through a concussion without trent williams and deebo.. That's why he was a bit off for those 3 games.
Eagles aren't even the best team in their division.  Overrated.
Have to point out that NOBODY saw this coming. Not a single commentator predicted a blowout against Philly. Shock and Awe all around. San Francisco is scary when they healthy.
CJ Shroud is the MVP i hate that they give it to players because of what team they on
Shannon stutstutstuter's too much.... Steve A talks too much.
49ers are for real good play calling
Molly please b quiet. Brock had 3 horrible games in a row last month. Did u forget. Stop being a lil cheerleader for brock purdy
Niners need to get help on the O Line. Trent needs helps  and needs to stay healthy
I do like Shannon, but this show has literally devolved into people yelling at each other. It’s borderline unwatchable because it isn’t a debate show anymore, it’s become a show all about each individual personality trying to flex their intelligence and “prowess” rather than having worthwhile conversations. I used to love FT, but this is not the product that I have loved for many years now. I’m disappointed in all of them.
Offensively eagles should’ve executed in the red zone but this really falls on the defense. 40+ points is crazy
They didnt beat the same Eagles team from last year, though. What are the whiners going to say if they fail to make it to the Super Bowl this season WITH Purdy healthy?
dan also have good flexibility and speed..💪
Great win for the 49ers. That is no doubt. No way that an NFC championship game from last year has anything to do with this regular season game. This is so dumb. We took those QBs out of the game. They didn’t trip coming into the stadium.
Such an asinine take you should be ashamed for even entertaining. 2 new coordinators, 5 different defensive starters. A pass defense ranked 1st in 2022 versus 29th in 2023. These aren't the same teams.
To answer Stephen A ? About 4 qbs gone down....yes ..Carolina panthers in 06 or 07
Stephen A. Smith 💯🔥🔥
Last year was Philly's year, they blew it. They should have won that super bowl game. This year is a different, they have holes in the defense. Not as a good.
These guys are so inconsistent first, tyreek mvp over Tua now, Purdy
I hate how ppl actin like purdy is carryin the niners... mvp?? hes not even top 5 on his own team GTFOH
Eagles need to do some tackling drils
Can highlights stop being shown on a tilted screen? Who thought that was a good idea?
Philadelphia used up all their luck, strength, and stamina against the 4 previous opponents to just barely beat them using all 60 minutes to do so and 60+ minutes the prior week. San Francisco had 3 bad weeks in a row, then went on a bye and came back and began playing like they did in the first 5 games. 49ers ramping back up while the Eagles fell to the bottom of the hill means that the SNF game was perfect timing for San Fran to give Philly the Dallas treatment on national television. I'd like to see SF win it all!
And the browns beat them when healthy so
Yes! I've been saying it. Lots of Niner fans thought the same... Had Brock not been hurt, we'd whooped them bird boys. Philly fans saying cry about it but it's absolutely true! We just proved it SAME TEAM this time with a healthy QB. I firmly believe that we would've whooped the chiefs as well. We were the most elite team since Brock started playing!
Easiest bet of my life but nfl so hard I wanted to put my house on it but usually take 6/8 games only took 2 SF Miami & counted my money before game started…Dans correct you can see Philly kinda tailing off end of the game..Shay correct nfl has no patience the fans want to make every qb elite goat conversations etc after two yrs do TB12 try catching him it won’t happen cuz brady was willing to give up money and stay healthy for so long…Who will stay healthy between the dolphins (if they play at home or decent weather) or the 49ers purdy & all them staying healthy I think if purdy goes down sf can’t win if tua goes down they may be able to win so idk & both injury prone
beat em like they was theyre DADDY...bang bang ninergang ...stephen a preach bruh bruh preach schooly school them idgits lol....great football speaks LOUD
My Mr irrelevant qb is the mvp 🔥🤯🫡
Carolina panther lol
How does the 49ers lose every game in October 3 straight games and all of a sudden they are the best team in the NFL?
Umm yeah thqey were beat by thqe browns with a back up, yeah they're the best hahah 😂😅 i love unc but stephan a got to him saying all that stupid $hit
Nick on First Things First put Jake Browning atop Mahomes mountain today....so......also, I'd trust Purdy more than Dak in a 2 minute drill because we all know how McCarthy would handle the clock.
3rd and Juan is an unsung hero.  That guy is clutch on 3rd down
Shanons laugh at the echo part is hilarious 😂
Not only had the Niners lost Trent and Deebo, they lost the two soldiers who lead the 49ers each week onto the field, a United team, who lost two great players for weeks. Yet when healthy the Niners have won every single game so far this year. How did they fair vs the Cowboys, Jaguars, Seahawks, and Eagles, absolute destruction. Niners look to me to be in a class of their own. Unreal and dominating. But their unity as a franchise, along with great coaching, even after losing three coaches in a row who are now head coaches in the NFL. A great team, with players who play as one!  So proud of them.
God forbid but if deeboo is injured.then the season will be over .we seen it earlier this season .they struggle and straight up lose without Deeboo” samuals
The NFL season is a marathon. No discredit to how talented the 49ers are but I believe they are sprinting a little too early. I believe they are peaking a little too early. I’ll be impressed if they get home-field advantage and at least make it past the second round. As of now at the end of the day, it’s still only the regular season. Same goes for the Cowboys.
Niners are looking Purdy good
Demolition job 😂😂😂 Shannon is naturally funny 😂
When the blew out happens, everybody seen it coming, but for some odd reason all their picks were 49ers by between 3pts and 7pts gtfoh with the bs
How is Brock Purdy ahead of CMC in the MVP race? It makes no sense. It’s literally ridiculous
Plucked Dem Feathers 🏈❤️😤😤💛 Niner Gang Forever
They gotta change up the Lions schedule next year again. Love all the prime time games we are given. But we gotta go against the heavy hitters in other divisions. We not getting no respect.
If the 49ers were that talented they would've won the NFC Championship in spite of loss of Purdy. Purdy doesn't play defense, Purdy doesn't run the ball and Purdy doesn't catch the ball. He is one man. They cherry pick too. SF isn't the same team as last year, and neither is Philly. New defense, new coordinators on both sides of the ball
Wait til Christmas fuxk dem 9ers😂BMORE💜🖤
does anyone really think cowboys have a chance to be in the playoff these team beaten easy teams these year next week we gonna see if cowboys even worth talking about ..
SAS is a silly "dough boy", with a loud mouth, of course we all can see the 40 whine'rs, are head & shoulders over everybody, when healthy, but they still gotta play the game, it's not a given they automatically win the SB last year if Purdy doesn't get hurt, or crown them already this year,.....GTFOH!!  "Any given Sunday"🤙💪🤠
Why Did the 49ers Lose  to the Browns Bengals & Vikings ? That’s why the Eagles lost to Them the same Answer !! Main Players w￼as Hurt!!!
Why is Dan so stupid in this clip lol. Guy needs to let Stephen A make his point lol Jesus
Debo samuel is the biggest x factor to ever exist. Put him on the eagles for that game and the score would be perfectly reversed.
Shannon Sharpe is a Purdy hater. Will never give Purdy his credit. Yes, late to the bandwagon.
What’s even scarier is that Brock still has 2 more years on his rookie contract. the 49ers also have the most cap space in the nfl to get even MORE talent. When the 49ers are fully healthy, the NFL is screwed….
MVP is a qb award and DPOTY is a Pass rusher award. That being said Tyreke Hill is my MVP
6x straight TD’s. Talk about shoving the foot up ya axx. Philly still trying to get the tags off the bus that ran them over.
The Eagles got away with too much-this digging ourselves out of close games rather than definitely winning like SF just did. Ik the beef between players and coaches are there but SF good win yall good hella scary team hope we can give you the better version of our team next time
Wasn’t Shannon saying a handful of weeks ago that Brock wasn’t all that?🤔
Mahomeboiii
How is Brock purdy in the mvp race his skill position players do ALLLLLLLL the work 😐
I guess it doesn't matter that the Eagles lost a starting safety and 2 starting linebackers who played last year and were going with a roster of linebackers who were all cut by the Eagles at some point and resigned. It also matters that we lost our offensive and defensive coordinators from last year. Last year is done and over with.
I could listen to Dan and Shann all day
"Are you concern about injuries" what a stupid question to ask. 10:26
Brock Purdy is not no mvp player can he do that with a average team I don’t believe so lol 😂
That’s not the same eagles 🦅 team as last year don’t even have miles sanders and more last year players
When the bullies get bullied😂😂😂😂lol
eagles cant tackle
Let’s not try to change history, Shannon. Dan was never seen as elite quarterback in the NFL lol
Shannon got to stop this backtracking. It's nasty work 😂
The best team with 3 losses and the other team has 2 losses and is number 1 in the same conference
San Francisco had 10 days rest. Dallas will have 10 days rest too! Eagles losing back-to-back.
I ain't buying no unrested team BS. Man, they at home, and look, if they elite, then they didn't have to let the average BIlls take em into overtime with sus calls going in their favor to squeak out another lucky win. Not having a QB??? That's an actual excuse, and we had that BS shoved in our face for a full year, with their trash fandom saying they were gonna break Purdy's arm again. Well, you know what??? These Niners broke the doors off their house, and made a team with a supposed "elite" QB who is somehow in the MVP conversation, look like they didn't have a QB. They might as well have had Josh Johnson in there like we did, because Hurts ain't that guy and he ain't tush-pushin' his way into that guy. Ain't don't think his padded stats in garbage time is fooling anyone, because that lame 85 QBR could've been much worse.
They talk about purdy not being able to win when down score.. to me the NINERS only lost 2 games cause he put the team in position to win that browns game but lost cause kicker missed game winner..

This segment was going fine until Stephen A inserted his ridiculous hot take.  I’m a die hard Niner fan and I can honestly say the Eagles would have won the NFC Championship in a closer game. The Eagles O Line DOMINATED our front 7.  Go back and watch the game.   I think the frustration with the Niner players and fans like myself after the game last January was the fact they didn’t get to compete.  The Eagles knocked our QB out of the game. It happens.🤷🏾‍♂️
GLOCK PURDY
Hey orvlashkhky close your mouth on live TV u look stupid
I called it on the radio show told em niners live this blow out
On Christmas #8&#0 is coming to town!!
Brock Purdy is not an MVP. He throws to open receivers that lead in yac as a team. 😂😂😂
Why does Dan say "Yes, sir" to Stephen A. Smith?    Is it part of his contract to kiss his azz?   disgraceful.  Just say "Yes." and that should be enough, Mr. brown-noser.
Philadelphia secondary is leaky like an old faucet
I stlll believe Dallas has the best roster top to bottom.
Purdy was behind in those three games for a reason. Missing key players makes it hard to "come back".
I love how the Eagles injuries never get brought up in these comparisons. Missing our starting MLB, Nickel CB and Top 5 TE while both Lane & Fletcher playing hobbled after 3 games in 13 days. Sure 49ers whooped us good but please lets not completely ignore context.
I can see Shannon is keeping Stephen on his toes with speed of thought, speed of delivery, substance, statistics, punchlines (incredibly memorable ones)...
Figged!!
Injuries are part of the game… yea but we have all seen what losing your QB can do. Colts were in the Super Bowl and 2 years later they were drafting 1st overall because they lost their franchise QB. Niners lost ALL their QBs and had to play in the NFCCG lol
Eagles on top
But we blow out the cowboys to its A 1 man mvp
That game was a revenge game and Coach Shamahan allowed violence to reign. That's not football, that's a huge cage match. If the Eagles played poorly, fine. But the ignorant over violent behavior does not represent fair play in sports. The NFL just LOVED making money off if this game.
The 9ers have 1 remaining bad matchup on their schedule. The Ravens are not a good matchup for them. If Ravens are healthy 9ers have something on their hands.
I'm a ravens fan They are O.D. 😂 49ers are good but the best team in football 😂 they setting them up to get their feeling hurt Brock is only as good as the talent around him 😂 MVP wouldn't do him well cause if his help goes everybody will be like he's horrible I'm saying it now remember
I love all these people jumping on the 49ers bandwagon. Brock Purdy has been the best QB all year.
These analysts have a 50/50 chance of picking the right team. When they’re wrong you hear nothing, but when they’re right you hear them say they were right again and again and again! Especially Skippy B… the newest old white black man in sports!
The mvp is tyreek hill. And its not a debate.
Love what Brock is doing. But I think Deebo is MVP. 3 losses by Niners coincide with Deebo being out with injury. He gives Brock and Kyle 2 Queen pieces (go anywhere, do anything) on the board. You can stop one. But you do not have a prayer of stopping two.
As a Detroit fan , this is what I noticed ..  Philly has no tight end , been without Goddert for last month and went 3-1 playing Dallas , KC, bills and San Fran.  Philly also played Miami basically in that same span .. so In 6 weeks Philly went 5-1 winning 5 straight including 4 playoff teams with 3 of 4 being Superbowl teams and losing to potential Superbowl team..  Now , when San Fran lost their #3 (deebo) , they went 0-3 , losing to browns , Minnesota and then at home to Cincinnati by 14.. none playoff teams. And niners only quality opponent was week 5 vs Dallas and you could say Dallas wasn't even going yet at that time , which score reflected.. niners playing Dallas now could be a totally different outcome as Dallas found their rhythm it appears .   Also Philly played KC , buffalo and San Francisco in 14 day span , while San Francisco had 10 days off prior to playing Philly..   With all that , this was not a bad loss at all for Philly whatsoever , niners exposed nothing but a tired Philly team without a #3 that just ran the toughest 6 week gauntlet in maybe NFL history..   San Francisco better hope they stay healthy the last 6 weeks because they are gonna need to be .. because my lions are coming for them!! Then we are going after Philly !!   As a neutral fan, eagles are the best team.. with 2 new coordinators, no #3 , a 6 week gauntlet they went 5-1 beating 4 playoff teams including 3 Superbowl teams??!! Shutting Miami down to 17 points 6 weeks ago..    With Dallas Goddert back , eagles will be scary .. real easy for San Francisco to shut down a tired Philly offense when they can stuff the run and keep Jalen from running.. no #3 been eagles issue the last month , but they somehow went 3-1 , amazing .. San Francisco was 0-3 with our their #3..   So who had the hardest schedule so far and who is really the better team?? Well I wouldn't want my lions to have to play Philly come playoff time !!   That 0-3 stretch San Fran went on without deebo , offense wasn't crap putting defense on field In bad situations, that's why cousins put up 400 on em and looked like Joe Montana for a week!! If I were San Francisco I'd smarten up and realize this win meant absolutely nothing!!   Go lions !!  Goff for MVP , getting it done with buncha above average talent and 0 superstars on either side really with exception of Hutchinson..   Purdy ?? MVP?? Got best defense in NFL. Best running back /receiving back maybe ever ? Deebo , kittle and aiyuk..  LMAO .. I could be MVP with those guys and im old as dirt..   Goff should be mentioned !!
Dumb sports world act like 49ers won the Super Bowl 😂 this a regular season game Jalen ain’t going out like that
SAS' need to be excruciatingly cringe is why I haven't subscribed. Don't the Eagles have a slightly different roster as well as coordinator change? Isn't this a more experienced Purdy than the one that played in the NFC championship game? It's honestly been embarrassing seeing all the simping going on for my 49ers.
This may be the most rediculous take I think I've ever seen by a professional sports journalist or commentator. The 2022 Eagles were better than the 2022 49ers. The reason we know this is because the game was decided on the field. The ongoing commentary about how "if Brock Purdy hadn't been injured the 49ers would have won", Is one of the most assinine, unsportsmanlike ideas flouted on sports "media" outlets and from the mouths of disgruntled fans. The 49ers in 2022 had an issue protecting the QB. Trey Lance got hurt on a QB draw and Jimmy Garapolo was injured on a sack against Miami, both season ending injuries. Enter Brock Purdy; a third string rookie. Purdy plays suprisingly well enough to reach the NFC Championship game. Here's the problem with the "if Purdy" argument. Purdy wasn't injured falling in the shower or in a freak car accident, slicing his hand cutting a Bagel, or even in practice! He was injured the same way Lance and Garaoplolo were injured! The inability of the 2022 49ers to protect the QB. The Eagles had a dominant defensive in 2022 which almost broke the NFL record for sacks in a season! So, if a number 1 record breaking pass rush is matched up against a team that can't protect the QB, the inevitable result will be the QB may be injured! Which is exactly what happened in the 2022 NFC Championship game. Not only to Purdy, but also with Josh Johnson being knocked out of the game with a concussion! This argument is embarassing to "professionals" who have years of experience covering sports and claim to be "experts" and a disservice to not only the fans but also to the players who put it on the line to play the game! In 1990 the 49ers faced the Giants in the NFC Championship game featuring an all-time great hall of fame offense featuring Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Roger Craig. The Ny Giants had an all time great Hall of Fame defense featuring Lawrence Taylor, Pepper Johson, Leonard Marshall. In the 4th quarter of the 1990 NFC Championship game, Montana is flushed from the pocket by Lawrence Taylor and hit from the back by Leonard Marshall, knocking him out of the game. This would be the last game Joe Montana ever played for the 49ers. A team that "seemed" destined to win another Superbowl. It could be argued that "if" Montana had not been injured, the 49ers would have went on to beat the Giants in the NFCCG and ultimately the Buffalo Bills in the Superbowl. Does this Deligitamize the 1990 Giants, who in the following year failed to make the playoffs? No! Nor does a regular season defeat of the 2023 Eagles by the 2023 49ers, deligitamize the 2022 NFC Championship by the Eagles. Sports media please do better!
Told y’all!! 😂 now y’all gone switch sides & hop on the Niner Train. New haters every week. Keep Sleepin on Us
I’m an eagles fan and I feel like this whooping we got was needed in order to hopefully make much needed changes
whether stephen commentary is non-sense or not, his delivery is compelling to watch.
@11:04 that man has the whistle of an angel
They won't cover that chargers game
Why is no one talking about the first quarter which was dominated by the Eagles, then boom, complete opposite….
What about the 2 different coordinators? That’s a huge part of how a team operates.
Philadelphia doesn’t have the same defense as last year cut it out they had no chance of beating the eagles last year defensively Philly was outstanding their defense took a step back this year
Shannon almost called Stephen A Skip again
D/O & Unc the best
Why does everyone compare last year defense to this year’s. The Eagles had a better defense last year and they were top in defense this is a whole different defense with new players and coaches.  So you can’t compare the two. 49ers came in and lost to that top defense last year.
lmao, fans n media are overreacting to this eagles loss. They were injured n gassed, they just got Shaq Leonard, Cunningham n goedart coming back from injuries. This team can still make the SB n they can beat the niners at their best but Niners rn is the best team tbh. Give them respect for blowing out 3 top teams in the league. My SB pick rn is niners over ravens 31-17.
Eagles are a different team this year. Another dumb take from this idiot.   The whiners got their win and are the better team this year. The coordinators are an issue for Philly.
Everyone forgets the Eagles are minus 6 starters from the defense at the end of last season. Both safeties, both LB's, slot corner and Hargrave. All of those positions are inferior this year.
Brock Purdy throwing 300 yards and 250 comes off screens and 5 yard routes where the receivers do all the work 😂😂😂 that guy isn’t the MVP he’s just the product of that system. He has the pieces around him. If you can’t see that you’re bias and blind
Purdy is Americas new sweet heart  BANG BANG
MVP, what about CMC?
These philly fans are delusional. just like that stupid Bradley Cooper movie
How can Purdy be an MVP when he is not the best player or the MVP on his own Team????? CMac and Deebo are 1 and 2 , Trent is 3 then him 4 but he is an MVP front runner HOW???
Eagles o line played well Hurts had a lot of time but 9ers coverage in the secondary was just outstanding.
Honestly just waiting for the Lions to end up as the top seed in the NFC hahaha
Prescotts interception number will regress to the mean. Purdy will not. I’m taking purdy in crunch time 10 times out of 10
Go Cowboys this Sunday!
Why can't McCaffrey be MVP?
MVP can't go to a team. Purdy is what he is because of his team. Dak is carrying his team right now. The yards after catch (which is a receiver stat) is insane for the 49ers. Their receivers are putting in work. There is a reason Purdy looked awful during that stretch when Deebo/Atkins were out. Right now, I have to give the MVP to Dak.
The Niners are the best unless they suffer another unfortunate injury, which they are prone to do.
The Niners scored six consecutive TD's. The Eagles did not stop them once after the first quarter.
This tone will change in a few weeks 49ers eagles cowboys ravens we dont know until the playoffs
This show is so ghetto, trash, no class. Worst show ever!
If tyreek gets 2k, the MVP should be his
Well I do remember my Minnesota Vikings beat the 49ers. If only Kirk Cousins wasn’t hurt what type of season we would have. Born and raised in Minneapolis by the way 😉 💯
so im sayin this now, and its a hot take. dallas will do the same thing to philly in dallas, it was a 5 point game in philly for dallas, you want the truth, jalen has been mediocre all year, since the bye, dak has been cooking, cover aj brown, cover devonta, and the game isnt close. 9ers just showed everyone how to beat the eagles, dak torched philly in philly. defense will simply play better come sunday, it's gonna be an imitation of this game. and i will say, NOBODY wants to play the 9ers. they're the best and it's not even close. but thank you 9ers for the win, appreciate it from a cowboy fan!
It's a two-person race for the MVP and they're both on the 49ers and that's Christian McCaffrey and Brock Purdy. It's not Dak Prescott they've only beaten one team with a winning record all year
Dan just mad cuz his team lost lol
You look good Molly Q 😍🥰
I love that somehow it the Eagles fault that 49ers came to play an NFC championship game with 1 qb. Then they ran a play where a backup TE was supposed to block an all pro pass rusher and their QB got hurt on a clean play. Im so tired of hearing niners fans cry about this. They won and are still crying about that game last year.
Stephen A just need to make sure he stay where he at once its all said and done.
They don’t care about who the mvp is now that dak is up top lol. Now all the sudden it’s a stupid award
Okay it was the same 49ers team. But it’s not the same eagles team. You can clearly see the difference. Much credit to Niners
if tyreek hill gets 2,000 receiving yards and does not win MVP then there should be a riot.
49ers and their fans aren't the least bit surprised by this outcome.
😂 we'll be fine it's only 2 lost games.
I can't believe the Eagles got THAT blown away. Could've been closer.
If Purdy wouldn't have gotten hurt we would have seen a rematch with kc vs sf ,niners going all da way there da best over everyone else hands down there stacked on both sides of da ball Purdy is mvp
Shanahan will do what he always does in a championship game. He will blow it and so will the 49ers they’ve done it for the last two years  good in regular season terrible playoffs.
Eagles lost both coordinators since last year, the niners have the same team, not the eagles
Dak Prescott 29/44	374	8.5	3	0	5-41	67.8	115.2  Brock Purdy 19/27	314	11.6	4	0	2-4	82.1	148.8  VS Philly - Dan hates on Dak every chance he gets. The man will not say Dak & Brock are mvp front-runners 😅
The way unc switched up is crazy really said brock isnt elite he a system QB and now you calling him a MVP comin unc stick to yo word
Way to much phony drama guys! The only thing that should be being talked about after that game is what is the NFL going to do to make up for wrongful ejecting a player for making a legal tackle inbounds and defending himself from someone who shouldn’t be anywhere near the field! I understand that the Eagles wanted to hide behind mommy during that beating but that doesn’t explain the wrongful and possibly career affecting ejection! The NFL owes Greenlaw and the 49ers an immediate apology and the players Union should be demanding one!!!!
Purdy is not an MVP!  A 2 yard pass yard DeBo for a 70 yard touchdown,  STOP
a month ago SAS called BP the problem for SF
The Eagles offensive coordinator is just loss, he has no creativity or ability to adjust to defenses affectively.
Shannon throw Shade at Dak no matter what.
Tyreek Hill deserves MVP....... Not any of these QB's this year
Last year's Eagles were better than this year's Eagles so slight disagreement with Stephen A. However, he is right about not being able to compete without a QB in the game.
It’s funny how injuries mattered for SF last year but they don’t for the Eagles this year. What a joke. The Eagles are a different team they were from last season, so to compare this years SF team to that of last years Eagles team is asinine. SF won. We’ll see the again in the NFC Championship game.
Purdy getting MVP nods over Jalen is crazy. Jalen has been balling and consistent all season with only his team’s 2nd loss just happening.  Jalen has been clutch while Purdy shines only with a healthy Deebo.
All of this is irrelevant unless you win the SB
Could have, Would have, Should have...that NFC Championship game is the past.   Niners just need to handle business. Take one game at a time. This was the sentiment after starting 5-0.   Still got a few more tough games. Just dont let the foot off the gas pedal.
He Scored 6 Straight TDs ... I don't think he cares if he up or behind... Imagine if the Defense never let Philly in the Red Zone...
As a brock Purdy fan, I agree with Shannon. He’s good, not elite.
Philly was the second half comeback team…  whoops!
🔥🏈😔🏈🔥
Unc finally saw the light and realized the truth 😏
Jet jj back in this
How is purdy elite if he needs all his weapons to be healthy to win games if Dak was just decent to good to the same people because they said he needed all his weapons 😂
So when the playoffs come and when it comes down to it. I want to say this Philly dismantle the teams these media heads put on deck each week
Last year was last year who cares
Molly please be quiet
Shannon Sharpe still hating on Brock not wanting to give props so he had to put in his tweet saying he doesn't care which QB was better.
BP did his thing too Shannon Sharpe!!! Give BP his props, with 4 TD's and Charvarius  Ward is becoming a Beast of a Cornerback, I see YOU, mad props my brother!!!✊ Great game and a sweet revenge!!!!!😁 49ers4life baby!!!!!😎
So 3 extra days justifies a 42-19 beating? 🤔 49ers 💪
These dudes are funny asf 49ers beat philly wit the same exact score they beat cowboys but cowboys are no good but philly get every excuse.
Stephen A forgot that KC boat raced SF last year..IN SF
Steven A is right, beyond right, so much more than Nick Wrong.  On top of all this convo...if you take out  a running QB like Mahomes, Vick, Tebow, Hurts and more...you understand the game and a QB that plays QB is the game.
CJ Stroud still the MVP...
Shannon thinks Dak is elite. 😂😅😂😂😂😂😂
Lmao says the guys who wanted to say pateick mahomes was the best qb to evee live after his 5th game
I don't have a problem with Philly being happy that they won the NFCCG last year and went to the SB. I DO have a problem with them completely ignoring the fact that the Niners played almost the entire game without a QB. They talk like they knocked off the '72 Dolphins. They SHOULD have said, "we know we didn't get their best shot so we look forward to seeing them again next year" and showed a little class.  They remind of these guys who pretend to be girls so they can 'win' women's sports.
You guys have been very disrespectful towards Brook!! He can’t do this he can’t do that bro remember when Tom Brady took over from Drew Bledso we coming you’ll just be ready!!
SAS full of it. Dak has won with backups on the line lol. Honestly some of the starters may not be next year depending on the off-season
Shanon sharpe - “Go debate in a cave with your echo”   Legendary
And im with my team. If we win or lose...all my life. .. that's y i love this so much. I have never been anything but a niners fan. I remember when we was a 4 win team at best. I love Jeff Garcia. Lol. Only 9ers player that i ever don't like is. t.o.
Hilarious. Wasn't these dude shitting on san fran a couple weeks ago?
One of the few times I totally agree with Stephen!
Dont forget that eagels are 1 OF 3 favorite teams for Stephen a smith
Im so glad to be a ninners fan..
Philly was tired and their dc and oc have limited  creativity schemes  to bamboozle opponents.
Greenlaw body slammed smith like he was the last man in the royal rumble.Bang Bang
Are we removing Tyreek from the MVP discussion? Imo if he can get 2000 yards this season, he deserves to win
Orlovsky is so jealous of Jalen, he can’t even hide it lol
what bout theam cowboys. eagles lost so they safe this week. ha
Stephen A is a hater of the Eagles. He must have gotten ignored by the Eagles when he wrote for the inquirer. He sounds so angry and puts up such an act. It gets old. He should thank Philly for his success.
The 49ers Infinity Gaunlet... If Kyle Shannon is wearing this "glove" -its a wrap for ANYONE facing this team. Mind stone: Purdy Power stone: Trent Soul stone: Deebo Space stone: Aiyuk Time stone: Kittle Reality stone: CMC
Very lame point saying that lost delegitimizes the championship game. Injuries happen. The Bengals wouldn’t have even made the playoffs 2 years ago if Lamar didn’t get hurt. Are they not legitimate?
I told yall so someone started clowning me saying the eagles would run away with the game but the truth hurts the 49ers are a better team
stephen A. Had a good point
Stephen A iffing again.  If is a waste of time.  The last super bowl is done no matter all of the iffing SAS does.  Save the air time, drop the if.
Bout X for people to start Respecting Kyle Shanahan! I said when the 9ers hired him that they would run the NFC for the foreseeable future , he's already been to a SB with Garapallo as QB, & he's on his way to a 2nd & 1st SB Win 💯
Ive been saying the 9ers are the best Team since last yr ! ,💯
That's right! 49ers THE best roster in the entire NFL! It's fact! Shakespeare wrote poems about this team. LFG!
Purdy beat Dak
molly interrupts to make a non point
Molly be doing too much
Shannon mumbels to much.
Bang ummm bang
There is no team as good as San Fran!
That 49ers team ain’t to be messed with ….. if healthy ain’t nothing going to stop them
You guys already have stroud as an elite QB, and he’s a rookie. Now you’re saying Purdy has to play more to see if he’s elite. How do you live with the mental gymnastics. Just admit Purdy is elite.
crazy how everyone thought the AFC was the better division & was so stacked. but here we are & the NFC looks like they have the best 3 teams in the league
Purdy shook that hit off helmet straight to elbow
You do not take Jalen Hurts outnof the MVP race. Yall are a joke!!!
This year's game has notto donwith last year! Philly beat San Fran fair and Square. Lets be real. San Fran beat us fair and square. Stop the talk of last year.
Cj Stroud Mvp
its a disgrace Hill isn’t the front runner for mvp
“Can we stop talking about what if Brock Purdy is in a deficit”…. THIS MAN USED THE SAME ARGUMENT AGAINST DAK!
Dak Prescott lost to the cardinals so no 🤷🏾‍♂️
Lmao… 49ers wins a game that they had to win and now they are 10 times better lol.. that’s jokes. I will see how the season rolls out.
How do y’all praise Brock for “dinking and dunking” when y’all ripped dak and he was throwing it way further than Brock. Like shay said “Debo is taking 5 yards and hitting his head on the goal post”
Molly is awesome until she opens her mouth
We shall see if the 49er hype is real on Christmas Day. BIG TRUSS and them  coming to San Fran on XMAS day.
I’m glad shay mentioned Debo is taking 5 yards to the end zone because that should take away from Brock cuz shay is the one who coined the term “dinking and daking “. Why is Purdy praised for dinking and dunking ?
Shut up about the clothes Jesus Christ
Smith is saying the Eagles got lucky last year. It's possible that last year was their best chance to win a SB.
If that loss delegitimizes the NFC Championship win, does our win against the Chiefs, in KC, delegitimize their Superbowl win? Does that make us Superbowl champs now?
49ers mopped the floor wid the eagles They got bullied ngl
Purdy MVP?????? Huh??? He’s got like 8 future hall of famers playing with him. The play calling is elite and so is the execution by ALL, not just Purdy. He throws a 5 yard pass and Debo turns it into a 50 yard TD. come on now. He’s a solid, level-headed and talented systems QB surrounded by multiple elite play makers.
AHHHH MOLLY BE QUIET!!!! Lol
hey aholes,the eagles lost 7 starters to free agency since that  championship game and both coordinators,its not the same team.
It be funny how these analysts make up beef between teams
The 49ers will not be in the Super Bowl! They said the same thing after the Dallas game and they lost 3 in a row! The Eagles knocked SF QB’s out of the NFC championship game! They didn’t get injured, BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!
That d was all over the field yesterday too. Swarmed the ball its the best ive seen from there D all season!!!
As a 49ers fan, Brock AND HURTS are SO MUCH BETTER THAN DAK!!!! THAT CONVERSATION IS A JOOOOOKE AND I CAN’T WAIT TIL IT’S OVER WITH!! Dak IS NOT ON THEIR LEVEL!! He is a punk who beats up on BAD TEAMS and then GETS SMACKED AGAINST BETTER COMPETITION!!!!
ON CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY BETTER PICK THE 49ers TO WIN DONT SWITCH UP
Wilkes=DCOY!!!!
At the end it's always What if this , What if that....   Give Brock his credit for god's sake...
Yes I trust Brock Purdy more than Dak Prescott.
Thats exactly what would have happened last year in the NFC championship if Brock didnt get hurt....
This is not the same Eagles team as last season……they forgot the Eagles lost 8 starters
Last time niners won a superbowl 1994 I was 14 my bday is Feb 14 this year 2024 30 years what a bday gift it would be on Feb 11
Stephen A., who never played any competitive sport, especially professionally, tries so hard to downplay Brock Purdy's skill and temperament as an MVP-quality NFL QB.  It only makes him look like an envious and resentful black man who just cannot stand to see a young white boy's meteoric rise from Mr. Irrelevant to Mr. Crucial for SF 49ers.  I doubt Stephen A. would act like that if Purdy was black because he has shown frequently how he is so racially biased in favor of black athletes and against white or non-black athletes.
He’s a douche!
I think Purdy could put up 70 tds and 10000 yards and we’d say it’s his supporting cast 😂
It’s a different team… it’s not the same team last year
Let’s go 49ers we win the chip just watch 💯
I am a huge Niners fan, and am amazed by what Purdy is doing. However, I’m totally with Shannon regarding the “recency bias” or “victim of the moment” issues today. Everything is the “greatest ever” now.   It took Brady years to get genuine respect, till Tampa it could be argued. It took Montana years to get the same, and his coach wanted to replace him every season regardless. The Dan Marino’s are rare.  Purdy has to earn it over time, that’s fine. What Shannon is doing by pumping the brakes a bit is a far cry from say a Steven Ruiz who has Purdy ranked behind the Daniel Jones and Mac Jones of the league, dismissing him as nothing more than a beneficiary of Kyle and his teammates, no matter what he does on the field. That’s clickbait crap.
As an eagles fan. We will be just fine
CJ Stroud is MPV
Philly won 2 extremely challenging games prior to the 49ers. Philly was burnt out. This loss means nothing
Stephen A is as obnoxious as Cowboy fans. That whole argument about last year is BS
Man i wish they would have me on the show love it !!!
Brock Purdy is a legit QB1 with barely a sesons worth of starting NFL QB play. This kid is getting BETTER every week. And for those of you who say he lost 3 games this year. One, no, He lost One of those games. The defense lost the other two. And the one that He lost, turns out, kid had a concussion.   Now, I get that crowning him prematurely isn't solid analytics. But my God. All he has done is, almost to perfection, play the QB position like a Gdamn Veteran QB. And enough with this BS that it's all Shanahan's system. Shanahan has been with SF for ... 7 seasons. None of his other QB's worked out. Including a seasoned Vet, Jimmy G, nor a 1st round draft pick, Trey Lance. Noteabley, Jimmy G went to a Super Bowl. But Purdy is just plainly and obviously several tiers better than Jimmy and it's not even comparable. The scariest part for all the other clubs is that Purdy's just getting started and this team will be together for the next 2-4 years 😬
Molly shut up.
Trent William  is an "A" grade player but the offensive  line got a "B" grade which tells you how good the rest of the offensive  linemen  are. Imagine without an "A"  that "B" average grade will move down to a "C "or even a "D".
People act like san fran didnt lose 3 in a row not to long ago
Why are you talking about Dallas so much all I'm going to say is that you can't see into the future let'them just play the game your opinion is just that an opinion nothing more even though it's scripted it's just entertainment and entertainment only nothing more nothing less
How much credibility can a mediocre qb  like orlovski have?
It’s very simple if purdy has all his avengers on the field he can be average, if his missing 1 or 2 players starts falling behind in the game he’s a very trash qb.
What a great game! Looking forward to the Ravens game! Great job 49ers ❤️💛❤️ it's quiet today. 🤭
Great debate. Dan is excellent, he is great on a panel format.
Shannon's such a good addition to the show. Got me back watching First Take again.
I’m tired of y’all giving them an excuse. We took the QBs out they were healthy before the game. They got the dub give them they credit but guess what it’s 1-1 sorry
imagine calling a team the best in the nfl by winning a regular season game to make them 9-3 with 4 other teams and could be 5 with the same record. quit celebrating regular season wins like they the won the playoffs. and what if they loose the next three again shannon. what excuse will it be this time.
CMC is the real mvp of the 49ers
SAS can't help but insult Dan whenever possible.
Idk why they compare last year to this year, Eagles lost both coordinators and two 3 valuable players on defense Hargrave, Cj Gardner and Maddox.
Sharpe the flip floppyiest woffler ever.
Didn’t the Eagles play 1 Monday & 2 Sundays? How is that “no rest” compared to any other team that plays Sunday & Mondays?
Dotn no one but cowboys fans care about MVP
smh why do they keep talking last year? last year the Eagles had a top D line and secondary. they could hurt you with both. it's not the same this year. all those qbs got knocked out by the Eagles. they are still legit 2022-2023 NFC champs
49ers and Ravens... SuperBowl
The point that all of the national media is missing about Purdy is his O-line is ranked 25th in pass protection with Williams. So when was Trent Williams was out for 2 games, his O-line ranked bottom of the league and he STILL played good for 6 quarters out of 8. He threw those picks in the 4th quarter and thats all the media remembers. In Purdy's defense, the whole team wasn't playing to their standards in those games they lost thats why they lost. Purdy plays with deadly anticipation and accuracy, so if his recievers are not in lock step with him, Interceptions can be had.
Aiyuk is ungaurdable
As a Cowboys fan I 100% agree they’re the best team. Not just because they smoked us, but that they have done that to a lot of good teams. They’ve got the best talent, and arguably they’re the best coached. Cowboys would be really lucky or something would have had to go really wrong if they win the NFC over 49ers, and I’m not saying that would be true for everyone else but I would be surprised if they don’t win unless something falls apart (they have been shown to be able to be inconsistent when they don’t have all their pieces). AFC wise, I’d love to see the Dolphins or Kansas City rise up and give them  a good game, but they’ve both got things they really have to figure out in order to have a chance. Imo, the 49ers are kind of scarily in a league of their own. When they’re at their best I just don’t know who could be a them. I understand if Purdy didn’t get MVP just because it’s his second year, but as much as Dak has done for us I’d vote Purdy (or Hill potentially).
what a bunch of actors.. you all belong on broadway.  This whole discussion is ridiculous.
SAS sucks !
Not worried about the eagles!!
I wish they would cut Molly's mic! She irritates me
I havent heard a FULLY realistic take on this game and these two teams all day. Do fans and analysts even understand football anymore? Its like people get that the 49ers are a much better team right now correct but everything else that is coming out of their mouths is just ridiculous. I feel like its been that way all year this year with every talking point. Did someone spike the koolaid?
Its not a wake up call for the Eagles... I see this all over.... You have 3 linebackers that were all cut and are starting for the Eagles... Eagles do not value linebackers... They always let them go.... The Eagles Linebacker situation will NOT improve....It is what it is and very good offensive teams will expose it... There is No wake up....
Y’all thought I was cappin now you’re going to see
They never show Dan’s career highlights 😂😂😂😂
Not bruh getting cocky after that tie comment 😂😂
WHO IS STEPHEN A. =  THE BAD CIA WORKERS =  162 + 81  Sad that you so called people of Color support “Stephen A.” He, Stephen A. thought he was protected by the CIA, the answer is no he is not. It’s time for Stephen A. to get judgment according ABBA Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. Send him to places worse than Guantanamo Bay in the Name of Jesus Christ, Amen! Cut all ties to Stephen A.
What I know Molly is gonna do..is hate on SF.. smh 😂
You heard of mossed well the eagles got deboed
Purdy best Qb in the league
If eagles won Shannon wouldn’t say niners is the best team in the NFL 🤦‍♀️
https://youtu.be/Kcz4SXDO2do?si=mtT0etFQTO7HZ3VA I am in disbelief at how well my dog sings!!! 😊
Trash take by Stephen A. The eagles aren’t the same team from last year. They have two different oc and dc players are gone and injuries. This has NOTHING to do with last year. The eagles were a better team last year period.
The NFC has brought back the vitriol hate from the 80s and 90s.  Buckle up because the next 4-5 years is about to be a nasty ride. Philly, Dallas, and SF is going to be a war.
Brock Purdy the MVP favorite with the least throwing attempts! #32 in attempted throws in the NFL! The most least asked to throw and be a QB! Still Mr. Irrelevant FOR MVP! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eagles showed their weaknesses yesterday, even if they are tired like the excuse makers claim, this was NOT a team that i can see winning the SB. Also ya saw yesterday Chiefs lose and that to me is leaving this thing wide open for a team like the 49ers to win it. I dont think any other team in the NFL has a complete team like the 49ers. If injuries dont get in the way, i see them winning it all. Im shocked because before yesterday i saw the Eagles as favorites and they still maybe... but 49ers have something going on
Screw the niners, winning a division doesn’t give you a ring 😅😂
Eagles aren’t winning/making any Super Bowl with a defense that bad (29th pass defense🤣). It’s not like this was a microcosm, their defense has sucked all season and it will continue to. Niners are just the superior team because they’re not just offense, their defense is dominating as well.
Molly 🤫
Can we stop making excuses for the Eagles on why they lost? Oh they were tired if the roles have been reversed then the media would’ve had a field day, saying how the Niners weren’t ready for the eagles
Purdy is so much better than dak. Purdy deserves mvp right now.
Look it one game  still the top seed just have to work towards  a better  game  let go birds
This take was too good 😂
Where all the smack talk excuses from the eagles fans now? The Niners and niners faithful have been telling them since last year...yall got EXTREMELY lucky. Well now there's on one word left....DEFINITIVE.
How about all the holding calls that were not called especially on three 49ers scoring plays and one when AJ Brown was held in the end zone. 49ers were clearly favorited by the referees
Dan can’t stand being wrong about Brock and it killed him to say he’d take Dak over him late in a game when you need a score!😂
Despite the Ravens record, the Ravens is the most dominant team in the NFL. Offense 27 touchdowns,  Defense only gave up 9 touchdowns is insane.
"not the dak prescott righ tnow"  -- always recency bias with these guys.... You have years of film on the man, the stats and film don't lie..
3 Games in Essentially 2 whole weeks . That’s rough dude
These "92 snaps" is such a dumb excuse.  Your defense wouldn't have to play all those snaps if they were any good and can get off the field -_-
Dan is waiting for them to say,  Kiss BCB C! Lmao
"it's the big one" lol these people were just praising the Eagles last week!
Purdy and McCaffery are in two horse race for MVP...
Over reaction Stephen A Smith...they gave us a beat down...that's it...regular season game...what ifs and all don't exist in football...we played well enough to win the superbowl...we deserved to be there too...
(Nick wrong) is one of those analist (If you can call him that) that goes against the obvious to make waves. Bringing attention to himself.
Brock is NOT an MVP! He’s not even the MVP on his team! His teammates inflate his stats! He throws a 10 yard pass that Deebo takes 50 yards! Doesn’t anyone notice this? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills!!  Dak throws for 300 yards and maybe 20 of those are YAC whereas Purdy throws for 300 yards and 200 are from YAC! He’s good but not an MVP!
Stop talking about last year Stephen A. They are both different teams. San Fran didn’t have chase young or Hargrave.
Dan is a broken clock 😂
The eagles couldnt execute in the red zone cuz they were playing the niners D. Its not like the niners stepped off the field once they got in the redzone. Still trying to take things away as they're saying "Cant take anything away from em"
They're arguing like they're sitting around the table on Thanksgiving 😂😂😂😂😂😂
ravens defense cough cough haha
Eagles will HOST the NFC Championship AGAIN this year . And WiN .  Write it down..
Man..Nothing like watching sports talk when your team wins lol
When Dan said I don’t trust Dak right now over Purdy and Stephen said “Oh My God” that told me a lot because he’s a top cowboy troll lol
This is to Dan talking bout they  can play a little bad cause of no deebo or Trent williams.  They had  ayuik McCaffrey and kittle and went 0-3
Dan hit the gillie whistle 🤦🏻‍♂️ lol
Why you gotta yell though? Dang loud mouth.
Couldn't have made it any more clear Stephen A Smith
Can Molly shut up
Put some respect on the San Francisco 49ers
Purdy is the qb version of 2016 jay ajayi
Eagles are different personnel this year. Can’t compare it to last year.
I mean Deebo wasn’t lying if Purdy doesn’t get injured in the NFC championship game last season SF wins that game
It’s still the same Niners but not the same Eagles team so this makes no sense.. Eagles were banged up no Goedert and more.. 3 games in 13 days.. You’ll get to watch the Eagles again in the Super Bowl
49rs is a complete team
Tell them Stephen A…. GO NINERS
Typical Stephen a bringing up other formerly fired coaches. Call out the main problem - Brian Johnson SUCKS
To add insult to injury. They scored 42 points without the assistance of turnovers from the Defense.  The defense gave up 19 points without getting any turnovers.  Your guys against our guys. We are just better, hands down!
Your are looking at The Champion (49rs)💪
Purdy had an awful beginning of the game and just shook it off but they juat move the marker for him. Now it's he needs to come back by a million and come back
and hufunga is out in this game and they beat them.
Shannon tried to slip in that Dan was an elite QB, like we wouldn’t notice. Nah Unc 😂
No HUFANGA SMH
THAT LAST TD WAS WITH 5 MIN LEFT SO REALLY 10 PTS
IF THATS THE CASE CMC FOR MVP ,,,LOOK WHAT HE HAS DONE ,,IF WE DONT HAVE HIM
The Eagles have been barely surviving all year. That kind of play isn't sustainable. The linebacker and DB situation will be the death of them
Let’s just yell at each other
We were down double digits with the rams and won by a touch down
What Stephen A. Smith said can't really be argued against. This 49er team could have won last year's NFC Championship if Brock Purdy didn't get injured.
Niner fans been believed in purdy after he and the niners beat Tom Brady in the 650 rogue the torch was passed that game he should of got rookie of the year last year
The eagles and their fans acted like they beat SF last year with Montana as the QB. Completely disregarded reality
WE LOVE TO BLOCK AND B PHYSICAL,,,,,,,,,,,WOOOOOOOOO
The rest thing is meaningless, the 49ers are just a much better team. The Eagles have been scraping by all season. It's hard to do, so props to them, getting all those close wins in games where they didn't play great.   Can't blame Purdy for leading his team to big leads early in games. It was the same "Steph isn't clutch" argument for years, because he led his team to blow out wins.  The problem with Purdy playing from behind isn't even Purdy, it's Kyle. Kyle changes his play calling when there's a big lead, when he's down a lot or up a lot. Yesterday he didn't, and they kept their foot on the gas. If they fall behind and he just keeps calling the game like it's 0-0, they'll win those games too.
MVP?  It's not going to be Prescott or Purdy, it's going to be CMC.
Shannon walking back harder than the Italian army on BCB! 😂
I hate the media !! It’s one bad week!! Eagles are still 10-2 we will worry when we are out the playoffs
Eagles should have lost to the Bills last week. This week the refs let them fall on their face. 😢
Im a Dallas fan. Have been for 40 years. But thats not the same Eagles team from last year. Truth be told, they're not as good because they lost players and coaches. This is from an old school perspective, from the 85 bears or any other team from the 70s or 80s. The focus of the defense was to literally knockout the QB. And knock him outta the gane. Thats the reason the QB is so protected now. So the best team didn't always win . What happened to the Niners last year was exactly what i want my Cowboys to do to Purdy, knock his azz out. Just like Dallas when they tried to kill Steve Young in the 90s. So the Eagles succeeded in that last year. They were the better tem and the rest is history. Believe me, when Dallas plays the Eagles next eeek, ill be watching Hurts blind side and praying they smash him into the ground. Just like the Eagles and Buddy Ryan used to do to Troy.
Purdy is the MVP right now by the definition of the award. This is a QB award and he has had the best season among all QBs this season. If Stroud and the Texans could have closed out some of those close games to have a better record, he would be leading the race but he didn’t start the season as strong, which is expected by a rookie, and they don’t have the record to back his case.  Purdy has it all right now. Nobody is going to dispute the fact that he’s the 5th or the 6th best player on that offense but among QBs, nobody has a better case.  Efficiency is there, numbers are there. 4th in TDs. Him, Dak, Herbert and Stroud are the only people to have 20 or more TDs with 0.5 interceptions or less per game. QBR and passer rating, he’s first. Only 6 QBs have more yards per game than him among QBs who have played the whole year. And he has these numbers only 332 pass attempts, that’s 23rd in the league. That is partly on the yards after catch but when we look at his competition, Dak has 411, CJ is at 418, Hurts has 403, Tua 401. He is so efficient.  So he has the numbers but Dak and CJ have just as good numbers, why don’t they lead the race. CJ isn’t winning his division and is barely in the playoffs right now. The team success isn’t helping him. And Dak doesn’t have that signature win right now. Now the Seattle win was impressive but he still hasn’t beaten a top tier team yet. Purdy has that. He has big wins in games he played big. Jaguars game after a 3 game losing streak, throws for nearly 300 yards and has 3 TDs. This week he beat the Super Bowl favorites with 314 yards and 4 TDs. Cowboys game, 250 yards and 4 TDs. The only big game he didn’t perform well in was the Bengals game. 1 TD and 2 interceptions with 365 yards btw.   There is no argument against him right now.
I absolutely LOVE Purdy, and I would love for him to win MVP but if anyone from the 49ers deserves MVP it’s CMC
Shannon sharpe smoking crack… espn got him saying bullsh
The eagles dominated the first quarter. Keeping the 49ers to -6 Total yards But the eagles couldn't capitalize on it only putting up 6 points then the second quarter Starts and The 49ers go on 6 Straight possessions for Touchdowns No excuses for the eagles Couldn't capitalize in the first quarter At least put up 10 And then the defense was a no show After the first quarter
Its wild that NOBODY was callin Purdy a MVP favorite just 2 weeks ago when they was in 3 game skid and he was playin horrible. Now after 2 games hes the front runner. I swear for lord yall are the biggest prisoners of the moment of all times
49ers went and play Cleveland, they had a bye-week.  Play Minnesota, Vikings had a bye-week. Then, play Cincinnati, they had a bye-week as well. Play Jaqs, they had a bye-week.  That's 4 straight gmaes against opponents with a 14- days rest each of them. Stop making excuses why Eagles lost the game.
I hate the 49ers. They suck.
Dan Orlovsky says the Packers are "dangerous this year". Say what? I am the biggest Packer fan, BUT I am also a realist. The Packers are 6-6 in 12 games. The only 2 good teams they have played are Detroit and  K.C. That's it! And they have still managed to lose 6 times. Lafleur and Jordan Love have done a very good job of  running the offense in the last 2 weeks and controlling the clock.GBP have had arguably the WEAKEST schedule in the entire NFL SO Dan Orlovsky and every other delusional Packer fan....Curb your enthusiasm! They are a 2nd or 3rd Tier NFL team this year. Maybe next year or the next year after that, BUT NOT THIS YEAR!
Swift got that bell rung!!! BOOOOOOM!!!!
It's not san Francisco fault they played 3 games in 13 games Dan.  Also it's not they fault they played 83 plays against Buffalo they should have gotten off the field.
The 9ers Look good but yawl riding the wheel too much cause any team can be beating
This convo about him trailing is so stupid cause he literally lead them to a game winning drive and his kicker missed
Molly can’t give no man a compliment except SAS
PURDY.    Not a 9er fan, but errbody know, if they had Purdy last year in the NFC championship game...they would have been in the Superbowl...with a bada-- rookie QB!
Are scalping Eagles illegal😂😂
Still have way more faith in Jalen Hurts than I do in Purdy
they've been a top rated defense for three years now...wilks didn't start the culture!! nice try giving yo brother props Stephen A.  Kellerman still more black then you
Eagles' defense has been garbage all season, everyone just overlooked it because the eagles got some fortunate breaks and Hurts was clutch enough to win every game by one possession. Wouldn't be surprised at all if Dallas, now at home, beats them by multiple scores next weekend. And I don't think philly is good enough defensively (especially in the secondary) to win the Super Bowl this year
They both suck lol
These shows, all they prove is, it's any given Sunday, every week they change their stance on teams, they're all for a team until they get beat, then they talk about the team that won, then that team will lose and they'll talk about the winner of that game 🤣🤣🤣🤣 people trash skip but at least you know he's gonna be delusional and always root fir the cowboys 🤣🤣
Still putting Dak's name on MVP is hilarious
I hate that Molly always interrupting
Don't worry Shannon. You're only the first one to eat your words on Purdy. At least you did it with class.
Still whining about the NFC championship lol you gon hold another L this post season. #LetsFly
The real question espn, is how do I get rid of all these Pat McAfee videos in my feed.  He is seriously intolerable and should not be associated with your network.
Keep this same energy in January lol saving this video
Dang I totally agree with Shannon 🎉
The most unexpected take I've ever heard from Stephen A about the Eagles being "Delegitimate NFC Champions" and as bias as I am Stephen A isn't wrong and has a point !!!
I been saying this for months. Eagles are fraudulent. They had the easiest playoff schedule going against the giants and a 9ers team with no QB.   With that being said, I won so much money betting on the Chiefs to win the SB 😂
I disagree the 49ers didn't benefit from rest early in the season they was catching their opponent off a bye or on rest no excuses for the eagles just look at our schedule
SAS needs to chill how the eagles losing something from last year lol the eagles defense was better too cmon now
The 49ers are the best team in the league right now and I'm a Ravens fan.  They're a complete team on both sides of the ball.  Gotta give props where props are due.
Purdy is playing well but CMC is the most important piece to that offense imo, therefore I do consider Brock to be an MVP candidate.
Molly 🤫
“Arguing in a cave with your echo” is definitely a line I’m stealing. Where Shannon be getting this stuff from? 😂
Mr. Sharpe 💯
This shouldn’t be a qb mvp dis year. Nobody hasn’t played like a mvp consistently
It take dis long to realize San Fran the best team inna league ima cowboy fan btw
What about tyreek hill for mvp? Hes having a better season then any qb right now why are we always trying to give it to the qb even when they dont deserve it
I think everyone knew that.  To be Elite Brock has to play more than 1 year.  What I feel and see is he is on his way to becoming a Elite quarterback.  Lets just say they did this year by year would brock be considered Elite for this year? Now we just saw the 49ers go into Philly and make them look silly.
305 will be better. Will beat the NFc
I trust Mahomes over all the active qbs right now.
Stephen A drinking the cool aide. Forgot that the Eagle team was much better last year than this.Niners added Hargrave and Washington’s best defensive lineman. Again. Deebo showed up yesterday. He’s prone to injuries.  And of course, WHOSE fault was it last year that you allowed your QB to get hurt and not have a quality back up? Please. Stop the whining SF! You won fair and square yesterday. That was yesterday. Just remember. Fly🦅Fly.  PS….#23 is the Niners MVP
Purdy isn't Elite, but he's Legit. Eagles must show more heart on their defense is Sus against a talented offense. Hurt will have to play elite to beat niners in playoffs.
As a Cowboys fan, I DO have to say that the Niners are scary, now. And I said the same, exact thing that Stephen A. said as soon as the Eagles GOT LUCKY and went to the Super Bowl. In fact, I am sure he got this opinion FROM ME. Of course, Eagles fans, from the garbage city of Philadelphia,  can always say that their garbage team TOOK Purdy out of the game. I think they just got lucky, though.
Brock Purdy is not that dude. He’s the best game manager for that team, but it’s easy to “look” great when you are guaranteed to have someone open every time you drop back because you got Deebo, Aiyuk, and Kittle who know how to get open and if by some stroke of luck you have them covered, just hit McCaffery in the flat. Not a single other team in the game has that luxury
I tried to tell people, the Niners are the most complete team in the league. Deebo told y'all, if Purdy was healthy they would've won the NFC Championship and well he was probably right. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Ah yes, let's use a two game sample size of Brock Purdy, when he didn't have his WR1 or key O-lineman, and say he is unable to come from behind. Stop comparing stats with other QBs that have their entire WR core and O-line when they're behind with Brock's stats. I agree we need to see more games, but it's so unfair to judge him that way.
Molly, please stop talking.
Dan should join this show I like him he’s aight
Dan going be so hurt when the 49ers come out flat next week or they lose the playoffs because Purdy threw 3 picks and a great d coordinator had the knowledge and team to shut it down. They are over rated sorry 9er fans it’s the truth
K.C just lost to green bay kc is not all that. The 49ers put up big point on Dallas and Eagles. 42 point on both those teams.
Jesus 10-2 and now the eagles are frauds.
This is not the same 49ers team as last year.  Chase young Christian Mc Brandon Ayuik emerges   They got more stars now than they did last year
That tie stare was comedy 🤣🤣🤣
I get SAS point.  But to not say Eagles are not legit is like saying Purdy is not a a Legit QB.  Coming from a niners fan, I wish last year's superbowl played out differently.  I would of loved to see how far Brock could of taken the niners then.  But that was not the case and the Eagles deserved to win as they put themselves in the position to win.  Niners (as freaky as it is to lose all your QBs in a game) was not prepared for what happened and therefore lost.  This game is just like any other game, the best prepared team won.
it's just one game ... their still in the drivers seat ... taking advice from all of these 'nitwits' in sports talk means nothing ... they don't play in the games ... so other that their opinions ... none of them bring anything to the table but whinging and babbling ...
This was a terrible take by Steven A. Philly lost a lot of the key pieces to that defense last year. It’s not close to the same team it was last year
i’m definitely a dak hater automatically cause i’m an eagles fan but i also have to give him and purdy their props this season respectfully. as much as i’d love hurts to get mvp after last season he just hasn’t been as good as last year. IMO however i’d actually want to see a non QB win mvp for some change. i personally think tyreek should be in heavy consideration (especially if he breaks megatron’s record).
How is Nick Wright going to spin the reality that without Brock the Eagles whipped the Niners and with Brock the Niners embarrassed the Eagles on their home field. I'm sure he's going to talk about all the playmakers around Purdy. Well, those same playmakers were around Josh Johnson 10 months ago. Purdy = MVP.
I new the 49ers could win by more than 10 point.  Rest had nothing to do with why the 49ers won with a big deficit.  The Eagles had to come from behind to catch up and watching the few games of the eagles new if the 9ers could stop the receivers and put pressure on them Hurts would fold. He did that . I said hurt was going to play hurt. The 49ers are the best 👍 team
As a Niners fan, I don’t think it delegitimizes the Eagles NFC Championship last year. It takes a remarkable effort to even get to that stage in the playoffs and that should be commended. However, what this game did was make it clear to the Philly players and fans that where saying Brock’s injury didn’t matter and the result would be the same, is there should be a giant asterisk over their NFC Championship win, because even though injuries are a part of the game, many people felt that the Niners were the best team with the emergence of Brock Purdy. I hope we see this matchup again when the Eagles don’t play 3 games in less than 2 weeks because it should be a good one with all the history now.
I don't hate Purdy, but he shouldn't be a top candidate for league mvp. He's not even the most valuable player on his team. Purdy should not be ahead of Tyreek Hill! The most valuable players on his team. That would be Deebo and CMC. Purdy had 314 yards vs. the Eagles yesterday, 214, were yards after catch. Thats 68%. With that being said the 49ers right now are best and most complete team
I like how they make the excuse that they need Trent Williams, but when Tyron goes out they just say "the next person needs to step up."
Dak or Purdy mvp smh Jalen mvp😊
The 2023 Eagles are the 2022 Vikings. Cry Eagles cry! 🤣
These guys are talking about a banged up Eagles O-line and yet Jalen had like 4+ seconds to throw on almost every single drop back.
Hold Up!!! As an Eagles fan we lost but you can't compare last yr to this yr as alot of things have changed. Not making excuses but we lost two great coaches where it mattered. SF handled business but not evely stacked thats for sure (different team from last yr).
MVP race is really CMC & Purdy
Decent show but next week is the game to see the Ravens vs Rams, 2 hott teams. If the Rams beat the Ravens then the Rams are questionably ready for a shot. I believe the Rams can beat the Niners in the NFC. Stafford and the Rams are playing high as the sky. Let's not forget that the Niners will eventually have to go through the Eagles, Cowboys, JAX or the Lions.
Lol 😂 we'll see during the play offs which team is the better team.....
So now Jaylen hurts not in mvp yall crazy jaylen hurts carry , how Jaylen hurts fall off with a winning record an 30 something touch down all his turnovers so now if we beat cowboys an cost threw the rest of our schedule then Jaylen now mvp
49ers are definitely the better team this year. But I think saying it “delegitimized” something that happened last year is going too far, we have to wait till the Playoffs, anything can happen there. I think the game probably goes differently if Purdy wasn’t injured but we can never know for sure, I mean that pass rush had 70 sacks last year.
Dan had to play years to be considered elite? Dan was never elite. Not even for one game
Nah, they're legitimate NFC champs, Stephen A. You can only play what's in front of you and who's available. That being said, we can say they became champs by several strokes of luck.
CRY EAGLES CRY
If u ask me eagles got beat down way worse by the niners than cowboys did
There’s plenty of things to talk about currently instead of arguing about the 49ers losing all their qb’s last year. Stick to this year.
Bro does molly ever stfu, Jesus Christ
Mahomes I think can beat anyone. He’s the best player in the league that’s coming from an Eagles fan. It’s football it’s a game. This week the 49ers are a better team. Doensnt mean they are a overall better squad
I'm waiting to hear what excuses Nick Wright and Shady McCoy come up with lol
What?? Saying the eagles know they are better is so stupid.
As expected the national media jumps on the opportunity to bash the eagles. This game clearly meant more to one team. No team is coming out of a stretch of dallas, kc, bills, 9ers, dallas, and seattle without a blemish or two.
The what if they scored 7 on those 2 red zone. Well, They came across a dominant D and couldn’t. Simple!
When 9ers lost 3 in a row it wasn't just cos Trent and Deebo were out. The Kicker cost them the game against The Browns. And Brock Purdy had a concussion in the other 2. Yes it's true we haven't seen Purdy make a comeback against anyone, but I think we have to question the HC more as Shannahan has never  won a NFL game when he's losing by more than a td in the 4th quarter, crazy stat!
No way Purdy should be MVP. The Niners are a very good team all around. Without Purdy they may not be as good but still a very good team. For the Eagles with out Hurtz they are a 500 team. Hurtz is much more important to the Eagles than Purdy is for the Niners
Shannon sharp go to sleep
Every talking about how this game would’ve been different last year but we hage the 30th pass defense this year last year we were 1 or 2 our dline got way more pressure and we had better coordinators we got to get our act together respect to the Niners they are a great team
Ohh ISH!!  LaShannon said wuutt!?
yeah don't give San Fran all that credit because at the end of the day the Eagles coaches failed to put all of that talent in position to win
dan is a moron lmao....and mr stehpen a, talk about lack of rest? Dallas had 3 games in 12 days and won them all.
Who are offensive coordinators from the Shanahan tree?
ive been saying all year the eagles are suspect and not what their record appears. hurts has been mediocre at best and constantly puts his team behind and crawls out last second
lol funny everyone clowning the eagles. Bruh our defense held them to negative yards the first 3 drives. OUR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR couldn’t scheme our great receivers open with Jalen having an ETERNITY against that “great” d line of the niners to get 2 touchdowns on our red zone drives to put them down 14 or 21 in the first quarter. Brian Johnson is the problem, and this is an eagles fan saying this. Slow starts ALL SEASON long and bad situational football
Stephen A never misses an opportunity to bring up race. San Francisco has been knocking on the door for the last 3-4 years. There is just so much that takes from game to game. What does Stephen A have against Brock Purdy?
9ers going to lose NFC again. I bet you. Fragile team.
We will see them again in the playoffs
It was long overdue for Philly to get knocked down a peg. In their last two games, they've had over 75 points dropped on them at home on their own field. Philly's dominance comes from it's coaching/scheme, Sirianni has a great system over there, constantly experimenting with stuff...  and besides that, Jalen Hurtz ability to extend plays while getting away from pressure. Longer he can extend plays, the more chance there is that coverages break down and guys get open.   But this has been the case for Philly all season long. Whether you're a philly fan or not, you have to acknowledge that while they have the best record in football, they've had a lot of 50/50 bounces go their way this season. I don't wanna call it "luck" but it is what it is. They are NOT the best team in the league, their defense is wholly mediocre and they can't defend the middle of the field or stop the run. They have great individual defenders like Slay, but as a collective, that secondary is consistently getting torched for big yards. With the Chiefs game, if they don't drop 2 passes... it's a loss. With the Cowboys game, if Dak doesn't step out of bounds, it's a loss. With the Bills game, if they don't hit a 60 yarder in the pouring rain, it's a loss. The way they've won their games hasn't been convincing at all to me all season. To me, the 49ers have looked like the better team all season, and frankly, as much as I hate them, the Cowboys look better than the Eagles too.
Dan is shocked why ? Stephen A spouting nothing but the truth !😭 eagles fans just mad cause it’s true
Shannon Sharpe saying Purdy was not very good 5 weeks ago, now he is MVP 😅😅😅
Total domination by my Niners yesterday! Bang bang niner gang!!!
I and my fellow Eagles fans can honestly say we saw this coming. Let’s be real , we been on the edge of our seats for WEEKS, watching them play. Prayerfully this will be a humbling experience. Fly Eagles Fly
Crazy how you throw away someone's chances after 1 game 😂
Shannon is born again on Brock...nice
If Purdy does not go down last year they win the superbowl
These dudes are the biggest bandwagon rider on TV, they change teams more than nba players do..
9:00 OK Shannon - Purdy is not an elite QB, but he is quarterbacking at an elite level right now. Anybody disagrees?
The real question is, is Mr. Smith going to root for Dallas this Sunday? It gives the Niners the edge 😅
Steven A arguing QB playability with an actual QB when NEVER put pads on is insulting and lacks any credibility. He wasn't even that good of a basketball player.
Ravens / 49ers is now the game of the year.
OH GOD SOMEONE TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON SHANNON AND STEPHEN A'S MICS. ALL OF THE SCREAMING IS MAKING MY HEAD EXPLODE.
Everyone said it last year. Eagles had the easiest road to the super in decades. The played the 9-8 giants and then the QBless 49ners. The week before 49ners had played a far better team in the cowboys. Eagles played good in the superbowl but the lost. 49ers probably wouod have won the superbowl over the chiefs.
Shanon said they did a demolition job 😂😂😂
Oh how the tide has turned in the Brock talk. Those of us who actually watch this team. Knows what Brock brings that Jimmy and others couldn’t since Garcia. He’s ballin and this game showed it. They didn’t have him last year with the same team! Says all we need to say for Brock
Why are y'all acting shocked? 49ers when healthy are the best team by far in the league. Eagles been barely pulling out wins and they have a weak defense.
I think Dan is a good edition to the show.
Eagle needed that defeat to reset.
The 49ers whooped the Eagles tail no question but it’s one game it’s the NFL who knows what’s to come yeah SF looked great and Philly looked awful but they’re 10-2 and to push the whole they weren’t legitimate last year is  BS first of all stop with the SF didn’t have a quarter back garbage in championship game when they hit the field they had two healthy QBs but the “genius “ of a coach decided he didn’t need to block Reddick as a result they were hurt on the field of play not before the game if anything there schematic errors cost them the game. Always flip flopping if Philly wins next week watch Hurts be favorite again smh
Injuries are less of a concern for a team that can put a game away midway through the 3rd and put in their bench
Eagles had a more dominant team last year compared to this year. Brock Purdy was also a rookie and has more experience this year. I still expect Eagles to beat 49ers last year. No guarantee but still should have been the favorites last year.
However I can defeninerly see a Baltimore San Fran rematch at the superbowl
Why isn’t CMAC an MVP candidate?
Love Niners from Texas. If Dallas had brock Purdy for quarterback they would win some superbowls, but not with dak the guy who cant perform in big games against good teams.
I don’t see how dak is a mvp contender ! The beginning of the season he was carried by his defense! Now saying this woulda coulda shoulda shot about last is is just ridiculous!
Eagles loat to the jets lol and got lucky against the bills and chiefs thanks to the refs … Sheagles ain’t winning anything just like the cowboys
i want someone to give me reason(s) why the 49ers are far better than the ravens. i don't see it. to say they are far better than the ravens is crazy.
I used to like SAS, but he mostly talks about non-technical football stuff, trash-talk...etc  nowadays.  I like Dan and Shannon's takes a lot more. Dan is not the best TV personality, but he is a great analyst and his football knowledge is very welcomed.
Love Purdy but still not mvp on his team
I love my boy Stephen A. But he really Dan biggest hater
Statement wins are made when a contender absolutely trounces a contender, and the only teams to do that this year are the Ravens and the 49ers.  We are lucky they are playing each other soon, as that will likely determine the Super Bowl favorite.  The Ravens played Detroit, 38-6.  Against Seattle, 37-3.  Those are impressive wins.  San Francisco, however, has statement wins against the Seahawks as well; 31-13, the Cowboys; 42-10, the Jaguars; 34-3, the Steelers; 30-7, and of course, this Philadelphia story.  The big deal here is Baltimore was playing in Baltimore, while the 49ers were playing on the road for all those blowouts except for once.  Ever since Trent Williams and Deebo Samuel came back, the Niners offense has been back to its juggernaut form.  Also, the acquisition of Chase Young on defense has allowed them to suffocate the opposition.  If San Francisco stays healthy, the only team that seems to have even a remote chance of beating them is the Dolphins.  Their coach knows Shanahan well, and if he can read his schemes and use the speed of his offense correctly, there may be a moonshot chance of knocking off San Franny.  Of course, they need to stay healthy as well, and Tyreek Hill needs to amass about 300 yards and 3 TDs for any chance.  As for the Ravens, the Bengals would have won in Baltimore had Burrow not been injured.  Cincinnati is ride or die on Burrow's back.  Their best players only play their best when Burrow is leading, on all sides of the ball.  The Bengals could have beaten the Silicon Valley Forty Whiners in the Super Bowl, as they had a statement win of their own on the road.
Was this Purdy first come from behind win?
I knew it would be some dumb takes today but eagles not being legit champs because of this game. Two different teams
SIX STRAIGHT TOUCHDOWWWNNNSSS
Every year they claim the same fame that the Niners have the number one defense well in my book if you have the number one defense, you should win the Super Bowl they lost to the Ravens they lost to the Chiefs and they lost to the Rams in the NFC Championship game and I believe they had the number one defense so yesterday game doesn’t mean anything if your team goes to the Super Bowl you have to win it if you’re the best team in the NFL The Niners haven’t won a Super Bowl since 1994 that’s a long long long time🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Brock Purdy is not an MVP.  Hes throwing 5 yard passes for TDs dude.  You put Brock on another team nope.  Kittle, Samuel and CMC are the best in the game. SF isnt even gonna win the 1 seed because of Purdy
As 9er fan how is Purdy MVP
The whole world knew The eagles should NEVER have been in the superbowl last year,  If Purdy didnt get injured the  niners would have blown the eagles out like yesterday.
stephen a's point is so obvious and mushy brain
I think the two leading candidates for MVP need to be Brock Purdy and Deebo Samuels. And that's coming from a Cowboys fan.
I’m not a 49ers fan but it’s very interesting to see the narrative change lol
The 49ers winning it all this time
Nobody wants to take in consideration how tired the eagles were from this schedule
@espn please tell molly to moderate or leave. Jeez. I want to like this show now for unk but she killing the vibe as a Mod
The rest of the December schedule will not be easy for the 49ers , but if healthy it could be a big ol’ but whooping
Great debate from all corners. Molly great question at the end.
So what the niners had 3 extra days to rest. You need to show up at each game. So if the eagles loose next week to the cowboys what's the excuse going to be?
Yeah, take away Lane Johnson and AJ Brown and see how good Hurts looks. You take away the most dangerous receiver and your blind side all world tackle and you're gonna look worse
NINER EMPIRE‼️😤💪🏿
Credit to DAN!! He tried to tell everyone WEEKS AGO!! 👏🏽👏🏽
Stephen A. Was trying his best to make this conversation controversial by finding something to explode about.
I still can’t believe Shannon Sharpe joined First Take. Skip lost in a way that cannot be redeemed.
So glad they gave purdy a good script
If they was being real, and they weren't pushing a agenda. Tyson Hill should be MVP.. btw im a Cowboys fan.
Steve A you doing to much
Go Stephen A, my favorite sports analyst!! ❤
This defense they faced is not anywhere near what our defense was last year. Purdy was going to have a long day either way. This defense can’t cover anybody. Last year we were at the top of the league in defense. Offense had a competent coordinator.
I agree they are scary
The absence of Swift Goedert mattered even though Frisco would have still won. Phillys linebackers have been harbage since last season Frisco is just superior in all facets.
In the AFC the 2 mvp front runners are Ty Hill & CJ
So now we use the rest as an excuse 😂 but GOD forbid they use that excuse in Dallas 😂 Dallas played 4 games in 18 days but let overlook that LMAOF 😂
the bird gang needs some rest . we will se the Niners again . they are very good indeed.
Jalen hurts fell off the MVP race because he lost against the Niners? Lmao. So if he beats Dak (again) what’s the deal then? This shits comedy
Idk what's better, the 49ers destroying the Cowgirls or those Phrauds
This loss means that 49ers can beat anybody I still don't trust them  to win the nfc championship game here's why they had a 10 point lead in the 2021 nfc championship game with 10 minutes left they have a coach that knows how to have the big game in control and still manage to lose
The Eagles have poor linebacker play all year. I knew it was going to catch up to them. Also Swift and Goedert out was a huge blow.
winning a championship take luck- but the eagles beat daniel jones and christian mccaffrey at qb to win the super bowl
What happened to form tackles
THE EAGLES PLAYED THE TOUGHEST STRETCH OF FOOTBALL THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND THE 49ERS HAVE NOT AND THAT SHOWED IN THIS GAME
Tape speaks for itself. Rpos aside.speaking about Hurts. Purdy is an elite processor, checks out at a high rate. Finding a different target.Always finds the right option. He's just the better qb. Bias aside watch the film.
Eagles still winning the super bowl  so 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Stephen A. Smith called it. He’s right. This game delegitimizes Eagles’ SB run
Great win lastnight but fam we lost our coordinators, these two guys have been shaky all year. We are not the same team. Lost CJ at safety, hargrave is on sanfran and we didn’t just play 3 games in 13 days. We played legit Super Bowl teams. Dallas, chiefs, bills and 49ers! No other team has done what we did
They should give the Eagles more credit. They have won 10 games in spite of having one of the worst defenses in football.
No lies told
(HUH....)  "It's FUNNY How 'SO-CALLED SPORTS ANALYSTS' Just LIKE To 'CHANGE OPINIONS & CRITIQUES', Like 'CHANGING TEAM JERSEYS' On 'ANY GIVEN SUNDAY'....(Or, In THIS Case....) The "MONDAY AFTER", Ya'll!!!!!!!! Smh, Lol....😄 Gotta Luv It, Though.... #FromMRIRRELEVANTTo.... #MRVERYRELEVANTLYPURDYGR8 #NINERS,BABY!!!!!! #GOLDIS4EVERTHESTANDARD!!!!!! 🙌🙌👍✌️
I love how Stephen A cut Molly off lol. Did you see that look she gave lol
So, Brock is no good because he always has a lead🤪
Purdy was down 2 scoring drives, and routed PHI in 3 Qs
Halftime: This is their Super Bowl,  like Dallas, Bills, KC, -- they're well rested and jacked up. Let's play rope a dope.  We see their playbook, don't show them ours.
I hate the excuse "injuries are part of the game."   What happened to the 49ers during the nfc championship goes well beyond "are part of the game"
The deal is. My 49ers did this in 2 1/2 qtrs. It was cat and mouse in the first qtr and half way through the second. 49ers just gave them hope then snatched it
The 49"ers are the complete team. The best hands down when fully healthy.
Purdy throwing 5 yard passes. MVP on that team is probably CMC, but if not than it would be Deebo.
Idk why they keep saying SF had no QB IN THE NFC CHIP GAME ITS NOT EAGLES FAULT THEY RUSHED THE QB and he became injured.
Anyone who says Brock Purdy is the mvp is so wrong, he’s not even the 10th best guy on his own team! Respect to him for coming in and dominating the stat sheet and playing above average in a league that is highly competitive, but I mean cmon his receivers are open by about 5 to 10 yards on seemingly every play because of Kyle Shanahan’s great play design not to mention their running game is the best in the league by a mile. Which as most people know extremely helps a young quarterback, give the man his props for playing well, there is no chance he’s the mvp.
Let’s pump the breaks on best team in football 😂 they still lost 3 in a row. You don’t just forget that 3 game losing streak 😂
Let get this straight: So now the Eagles losing means they don’t deserve to be called NFC champions? What kind of stupid s*** is that? We beat the Niners. Injuries are part of the game. I respect the Niners as an Eagles fan but Stephen A is a whole clown for doing that. That was last year. We won. Cool. Now the Niners have a chance to make it this year. Move on already.
The fact that the 49rs blew out both the Cowboys and Eagles makes a strong case for them winning the SB. Eagles are just not good enough especially defensively this year which is a huge letdown. Since the draft, I thought the defense would be fantastic, but it's been horrible. Offense is not creative at all, defense is sad, they haven't won a single game comfortably... Let's see what happens in the playoffs.
Not yesterday game got unc shannon walking back is system qb takes on Brock Purdy. Naw unc! Stand on it! But it's still MVPurdy 🔥🔥
Dumbest discussion of all time
The way Dan made eye contact with Stephen after nice tie lmao
When they lose in the playoffs say the same thing bout the Eagles
Shut up
Two different teams played in the Championship game last year. Eagles lost All 9 starters and Hargave was on the Eagles last year but now a their team.
Nobody talking about the schedule the eagles had back to back try hards , and when our best tight end was out stop it
The Eagles were a better team last year. They didnt loose the Super Bowl, they just run out of time.  Defensively, 49ers couldn't stop the Eagles last year in the Champions game and they got beat. I think they would have got beat with Purdy.   Ultimately, it comes down to who's heathy in January. It looks like they will meet again. We will see what will happen then.   I'm not a fan of either team.
Molly please be quiet while the guys are debating smh.
For what it is worth, the 49ers played 3 teams coming off their bye, not including Seattle coming off ten days rest for next week.
Spanked em at home
I respect Shannon for facing the facts and adjusting his judgement of Purdy. Guaranteed that Nick Wright is going to twist himself into a knot of denial, probably focus on Purdy getting sacked, then compare the first quarter of both teams and whine about Greenlaw.
So sick of the 49ers whining about last year. You got beat its over get over it
molly has a bad habit of interrupting 🤦🏽‍♂️
I hate listening to Dan talking about sports
Fly eagles flyyyy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Niners fans calling for Wilks' HEAD after that Bengals loss. FIRE STEVE WILKS. Look at em now.  It took some time but now he knows which levers to pull. #1 defense once again.
Scariest part was that Chase Young wasn't on the field much and still dominate the Eagles.
49ers are clearly best team in football when healthy. Not even close. Lynch has put together a monster.
How is the qb automatically the mvp candidate when the rb/wr hybrid is the key to the offense? How was Purdy w/o Deebo? All positions should be considered for the MVP award.
You guys are funny and saying 49 >thebest team youu guys are Riders cause when they lost them games traight in a row you guys was saying the Eagles was the best team.......😂😂😂.......next week you guys are gonna say the Cowboys are the best team when we beat up on the eagles watch.....and can't wait to meet the 49 in the playoffs cause we gonna beat up on the nines mark my word
Can't ignire who the eagles beat in the divisional round either guys.. the giants. Big deal really. The giants suck.
Ya! The 9ers had 10 days rest, but during their losing streak the played 3 teams coming off their bye!! So that argument is moot!
Wish my Bengals had a coach like the 49’ers lol. Zac doesn’t know how to use our talent to the maximum.
49ers not quite the same as last year.  We now have McCaffrey, defensive line and Purdy is better.  But still we should have beaten them last year.
Brock smoked Dak and Dallas, how could you say Dak is in MVP convo with Brock
Purdy is not even the 49ers MVP; Deebo is.
Any analysis of the Eagles' offensive woes must consider the role that their offensive coordinator, Brian Johnson, has in such struggles. His play-calling and predictability haven't exploited the talent and skill of his QB, RBs, and receivers. I don't buy into the belief that the Niners are more talented as I do that the potential of the Eagles' offensive players hasn't been realized on the field this season. 12 games into this season, and Johnson comes across as not having learned any lessons or is slow in doing so.  The persistent inability of him to get the offense to perform better than it has is what I attribute to why the Eagles' defense looked frustrated in the second quarter, and frustrated and/or tired in the second half. If the offense was able to rest the defense by putting together long drives that resulted in more TDs than FGs, I don't believe our defense looked as dejected and exhausted as it did at times. This doesn't explain why the defensive coordinator hasn't called for my blitzes or the poor tackling by defensive backs (particularly in the secondary), but I have far more concerns about our offense than defense.  The loss to the Niners has been a long time coming. A defense can only be called on so many times to give the offense more chances to get points before they say "F this", which is what I suspect some such Eagles players were saying to themselves. I'm not saying that the defense gave up on the field or that they lost the game on purpose (I genuinely believe they were trying to win even halfway through the 3rd quarter), but they've been called upon too much over the past five games to bail out the offense on such a consistent basis.  If Sirianni and the Eagles' ownership and management have any aspirations of a deep playoff run, they would be wise to fire Johnson ASAP. They must send a message to their players that they're out to perform as title contenders and live up to their potential. They can't have players on either side of the ball questioning their confidence and belief to win a Super Bowl, certainly not due to offensive play calling.
The eagles defense didn't disappear. It was never there. They get lit up by everyone.
It’s a regular season game… any given Sunday. We’ll see what happens on the playoffs this year. This is just a fun talking point doesn’t mean nothing!
Eagles soft they don’t wanna tackle
I am so sick of SAS and Molly.  Their hypocrisy ruins analysis for me.  I'm only here for Dan and Shannon.
We love Tyreek, but the NFL is fining this man every week. They’re doing everything they can to water down his creativity and put out his fire. AND he’s a receiver….. it’d be very cool for him to win MVP, but I wouldn’t bet on it
Anytime Molly compliments Dan Stephen a gets mad jealous
Adding Chase Young put their pass rush over the top. Him and Bosa are destroying O lines right now
MVPurdy! 🐓⛏️🏈🏆
Nah, eagles aren’t losing that game regardless. Brock purdy doesn’t play defense, neither does deebo, so who is stopping the eagles from putting up 31? They couldn’t protect the QB, end of story.
Promptly!!😮😂😂😂
Knew Swift would eventually go back to the Real Deandre Swift 😂 yall hyped him. Thats who he is reason why Lions moved on from him 🤷🏾‍♂️
Stephen A Smith and 49ers fans around the world are really stupid. He talked about SF having the same team as last year and all that ignorance. You know who doesn’t have the same team as last year? The Eagles. Lost several defensive  players and both coordinators. Also, who was hurt on SF defense in the NFC title game? Why didn’t they stop Phillies offense? They would’ve lost regardless of whether Purdue got hurt or not. Philly’s pass D was #1 in the league last year and now they are god awful. So let’s quit pretending that the same two teams just played each other. Ignorant MFs.
What would Jalen Hurts be like if he didn't have AJ Brown? Hurts hasn't be elite with him must less without him.
Dak 4 MVP!
That women is unbearable 😂
I dont get why u comparing last years playoff game to this years reg szn game. 49ers did groppollo dirty and lost all 4 qbs  cuz they didnt do right by him . Trey lance was the answer last year right? Brock purdy the answer tgis year the comparison dont make sensez
Eagles work best when they’re doubted js
Historically, the Eagles can be one of those against the wall teams that can surprise you. Based on that, these past two seasons can be seen as overachieving with the exception of their SuperBowl win in 2017. They were slight miscues away from winning last season. I don't think they can be written off entirely so come playoffs, the teams facing them better come ready to put heads on some mantles. If their opposition doesn't bring it, Philly will wreak havoc. My Niners best be ready to annihilate them again #NuffSaid
This eagles team as a whole team is not even on the same level as last year's team what is Stephen A saying? They had a far better defense, better offensive play calling The 49ers now are almost as good as last year's eagles, only difference is QB
This what I don’t understand 😂 When 49ers lost 3 straight it was “Oh we don’t have LT Trent Williams” .. when Eagles won 3 straight without Goedert and starting linebackers it was “Oh Eagles still gotta prove more” the narrative is so hilarious 😂. Then what’s also funny no way y’all talking like this like there’s not many games left, let’s see who have the better record at the end and who will do what in playoffs. Yea we got smacked , but that don’t make me feel any different that Eagles are still the best NFL team
Nah Shannon, it's the stupid take that the MvP has to be a QB that says they're the frontrunners! It's easy to see who the MvP is in the league, Tyreek Hill, no one is as important to their team as Hill!
Gotta get ready for that Eagles-9ers rematch in the playoffs. Eagles gonna get there’s back GO BIRDS
Shannon sharpe is hard to listen to at this point. He’s a walking contradiction.
I look forward to see what I think is the preview to the SB in a few weeks, my Ravens v Niners!
Wasn't surprised at all with the blowout. Their defense is str8 🗑️. We blew them out like we did Cryboys
Ravens will beat them on Christmas and the Eagles will beat them in San Francisco in the NFC Championship
they did some good math at the end there.  i like how they flipped it     we still got to see purdy from behind - pause
Lol y’all sleeping on the Eagles… wait till playoffs
Stephen drinking hatorade. 49ers are legit it’s their to lose or win.
Sf coach sucks, their qb and team, are better.
Huge 9ers fans but I don’t think Purdy is MVP material. He’s really good and solid leader but what Kyle has him doing any decent QB could do. He just needs to get the ball to CMC, Deebo, Kittle, or BA  and they’ll do the rest.
Orlovsky, and sharpe, the dumbest blow yards on a screen! Mac jones!!! Lol lol eat schitt, orlovsky, purdy is mvp.
Eagles had a way better defense last year, the 49ers wouldn’t have killed the Eagles in the NFC chip. It would’ve been close, but it’s not fair to say if the  49ers had Purdy they would’ve won easily. This is not the same Eagles team.
The Niners played two games in for days before this game 🤷
Why is Molly talking?
I am hoping that Dallas can beat the Eagles next weekend.  But I am more confident that Dak will throw a bunch of interceptions.
Brock ia a system QB like Trent Dilfer.  I can't believe Shannon is suddenly hopping on Brock's bandwagon right now.
Never watching this clown Stephen A after that terrible take.
Shannon: You had to do it for years before you were considered elite!  Dan: Fair.
Hasn’t Purdy played from behind before ?
Molly is nasty for bringing up injuries
The only way Philly scored touchdowns was because of the refs
Now Brock has to be down double digits in order for him to prove himself lol unbelievable
I fully expected 49'ers to dispense a beat down, because other than 2 wins, the eagles had no impressive wins all season. Don't be surprised if they suffer more than one more loss.
Love Purdy, he’s our guy. So I guess MVP is exclusively for QB’s, like CMC ain’t tearing up the league right now. This dude is a Swiss Army knife AND has over 1000 yds rushing with 17 TDs #49ers #49erfans #espn
Love the narrative being pushed 😂 gets rid of they bandwagon fans 🦅 they still finna have to come back to the Linc for the NFC crown if they escape wildcard weekend 🤷🏾‍♂️
So dak is in the mvp race when the cowboys lost to the eagles and the cardinals and Jalen fell off because he lost to what y’all are saying is the beat team in the nfl!?? Makes no sense.. Brock purdy mvp y’all serious!??
49ers killed the birds
Why is there no love towards the Lions when talk about the Big Three from the NFC (PHI/SF/DAL)?  They're doing damage.  It's totally disrespectful and I'm in the SF area saying this.
Purdy isn’t even the most valuable on his team as we saw in their 3 game losing streak lol no way is he the mvp of the league.
Eagles offense is good no concerns.  That defense is atrocious!  The front 4 is ok but them linebackers and secondary is garbage.
Every week it’s best team in nfl or mvp dam are they tired of contradicting themselves
Y'all, we need to start a go fund me to send Shannon a jacket that fits.
Difference is 49ers treated this like a super bowl and the eagles treated it like a regular season game that they could afford to lose. If you think the Eagles weren't pulling punches then you didn''t watch the game. Hurts was the leading rusher with 7 carries. The eagles are not showing their full hand cuz they know they're going to play them again in 6 weeks.
Get excited 49ers fans!… Because this was your Super Bowl this season. Eagles whooped the Dolphins this season too. None of this matters come the playoffs. As long as you get in, just like the 9-7 Giants, anything can happen. We got these talking heads calling the 49ers the “best team in football” when they lost 3 straight and then SA trying to “delegitimize” the Eagles Super Bowl berth? Stop. Just stupid. This is like saying if the Celtics beat the Heat, it delegitimizes the Heat being in the NBA finals last year. This is such a dumb take. I don’t care if the Celtics sweep the season series vs the Heat, it doesn’t at all affect history.
I don't care how many snaps the eagles played the other day. Multiple teams played 3 games in 11 days and found ways to win. If it was Dallas, no excuses would've been accpted.
Ctfu they just hate the eagles so bad it’s sad
They beat by 23, change that 6 to 14, it’s still at 16 point game! No change. You think they wouldn’t run the ball and call the same game in the 2nd quarter? Cmon. Niners were -6 yards in a whole quarter! They played from behind and they DOMINATED!!! Dominated for 3 quarters
Mike McCarthy and dak players and dan Quinn and players on defense chess with different looks plays keep teams guessing hidden gems 💎 🤔
Brock had 3 bad games and he’s leading the mvp votes, stop it
Why does molly always interrupt every 5 seconds my goodness just annoying
Tyreek Hill is the MVP of this league. Not even close if we are going to be honest, no one is doing what he is doing in any position right now. Just straight dominance.
😂😂😂 these mfs is crazy just wait until the playoffs Eagles will win the super bowl
When u monochrome give some bright swirling patterns on the necktie 3 colors max
Straight up 49ers hater right there
stephen A was wrong  when it comes to saying  the eagles didn't deserves to  be in the super bowl  because  49ers did have a QB  he just got knock out the game  then came back lol
Stephen, don't you live on the East Coast or at least, in the East??   If so, why are you all a flutter over the Forty Whiners?!
Stephen A. is right on!
Philly coordinators need to go
Preach Stephen A!
Eagles really miss Shawn Hochuli.
You know what you been through with both
It's all about Dallas doing everything so together on offense defense making sure they are keeping gems 💎 hidden getting it things done together Excuting not satisfied keeping teams guessing
Yall mvp take are terrible
Russell Wilson 5' 11" and Drew Brees,  6'.0'' and Brock Purdy 6' 1"  Shorter quarterbacks are an enigma. Super Bowl winners.
As an NFL fan.. This was a awesome.. I was tired of seeing the bullseye on the eagles backs... Now the niners have put the bullseye on their back... If the NFC knows they are the team to beat now.. The rest of their season is all super bowl games then.. 😂😂😂😂
Let's be clear here....49ers were down 0-6 when they started to make a run.  So, Brock Purdy did play from behind...not sure why Stephen A. Smith brought that up about him playing from behind.  He did play from behind...stop reaching for the straw.
Shannon is a flip flopper
I don't know if they know this, but they are football teams. The QB's are not playing each other
Deebo and CMC have missed nore than their share of games over the last few years.
So the 49ers team pulled a Larry Bird?  Talking trash and doing what he said he would. LOL...
PHILLY FANS DONT PANIC WE LOST 2 GAMES STILL BEST RECORD IN THE LEAGUE lastnight counted as 1 game not two so if we lose by 25 or win by 3 a win is a win
Brock is MVP candidate cuz he got a good team. Tua isnt cuz he has Tyreek
It was a surprise that they beat them this hard. Love how everyone is, well, this is what we expected. Hindsight is 20/20.
Bunch of what ifs..🤦🏽‍♂️
WHEN IN THE WORLD WAS DAN ORLOSKYY EVER BE CONSIDERED ELITE !?!?  I respect Unc’s kindness but lying on national television to a former “QB” who never won more than 3 NFL games in a 12 YEAR career is SICK revisionist history I refuse to see broadcasted. Unc should apologize to the NFL and ESPN immediately. Dan woulda made Mac Jones look like vintage Tom let’s stop it Shannon 🤣🤣
Ugh the previous SF QBs DIDNT HAVE CMC lol. Its not a coincidence when Purdy lost even just ONE of his FOUR elite weapons he struggled some.   They LEAD THE LEAGUE in yards after catch per completion.... by half a yard at 6.6 lol. Meanwhile 2nd & 3rd are seperated by 0.1 of a yard at 6.1 and 6.0 .   Jimmy G didnt even have CMC yet how did he look there? Now hes not even starting on his new team he JUST signed with.   U could put so many QBs on this team and they would look amazing..... CMC is the MVP of that team.
Shout out to Wilks who knows how to defend mobile QBs
Dak Prescott is doing it WITHOUT a running game. Purdy is gettable without CMC. CMC had his three lowest, rushing, outrut games on the year.......all in a row. Guess what? The Niners LOST all three of those games.
Dan need to stop it they have a super team over there in the O-line and receiver and rb position, Trent and Deebo should not be the difference between Purdue being elite and way below avg lmao word to Lamar Jackson that’s an elite qb
And talking about the Eagles lack of rest as an excuse? Please! They didn’t have to travel for their games. The Niners did. Get out of here with the excuses!
Philly started off hot and marched right down field twice. Yeh it was only 6 pts, but 9ers were also at a momentum deficit on the road.
Dallas hasn't forget what has happened to them over the years they have to stay focused on the mission the assignment getting everything down pack each component sharpening will equip the component the chess piece is moving properly Dallas must know how to orchestrate everything together as a group
Dan is a big phony. He was a LOUSY quarterback that thinks he knows everything and it is obvious that he didn't know while he was playing in the NFL! NOW PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT 🚬
Purdy and Niners for MVP right now
Y’all crazy. Tyreke should be the favorite.
Brock purdy should be mvp favorite. He’s sat multiple 4th quarters because we’ve been blowing people out
I am pretty sure, last season Brock Purdy came from a 10-point deficit against Las Vegas.
Eagles bad habits caught up with them!  Opens door for the Cowboys
Ravens defense absolutely have the ability to stop the niners. dec 24th
The 49ers proved that with Christian Mccaffrey healthy they are the best team within the NFC
The 49ers proved there point against  the Eagles. Just like Tyreek Hill is proving his point that the Chiefs should have kept him. It's just facts
Leave it to Uncle Shay to take an opportunity to shade Dak with his tweet when talking about 2 other teams “I don’t care what qb is playing the best” cmon unk!!!!
Niners!!!
I called the game 42-17. Eagles scored 2 too many points.
These shills keep saying that injuries are part of the game. How about extending the season as part of the problem. Greed is watering down the game. The winners at the end of the season are whoever is lucky enough to not have a lot of injuries not the best team. How about doing something to minimize injuries?
shannon was trying his absolute hardest to not give purdy any credit😂😂
The
One week this teams the best next week that teams the best 🤣🤣 btw the super bowl is gonna be a rematch
You can’t play shoulda coulda woulda lol. Injuries happen. It’s a new year
Cry Eagles, Cry! But lets not forget 49ers lost to the Browns, Bengals, and Vikings. Best coach? Not at all. They can't win games when trailing. Of course they had to mention Dallas in this segment :)
Brock Purdy is elite
Why do they dismiss the fact that Dallas was missing some top players on defense when we played as well as O line players, also Dallas has figured out their offense since then! Dallas is not the same team they beat earlier in the season!
Dan trying to get aggressive with Shannon over Purdy is hilarious to me, I can't wait to see Dans face when the 9er in lose in the playoffs and it'll be because of Purdy
Dan getting down on his knees for QBs never fails🤣
It’s week 13 brooo. Anything can happen between now and the superbowl.
eag;es offense is trash and their defense is overrated
what’s crazy is Dallas got blown out in San Fran, Eagles got blown out AT HOME 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
DO get off purdy D
Elite has never been attached to Dan's name 😂
Dan will say anything crazy to keep his name around
Can we talk about this not even the same eagles defense from last year?
as a cowboys fan we told you so😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Brock Purdy DID NOT dominate Jalen Hurts. I'm tired of people thinking these games are QB vs. QB. The Eagles defense is a fraud. The whole Philly TEAM is a fraud. They're a bounce, A wrong route, a dropped pass and a call/non call away from being 6-5. Since when do GOOD teams need to "find a way to win" against the likes of the Patriots, Vikings, Rams, Commanders (twice) and a .500 Bills team? Add is sus wins against Dallas and KC and what are we talking about here?
whats the excuse when san fran lose again come playoffs.
shannon back pedaling…😂
CMC over Purdy for MVP tbh
This show sucks Stephanie A smith is annoying!!!
I think Baltimore has something to say about San Fran & we’ll see Christmas’s night who the best team REALLY is
Patrick maholmes got beat down in the super bowl and they claim he didn't have his tackles.  Cmon people
Wait, so one bad game and Jalen is no longer in the MVP conversation? After beating the Dolphins, Cowboys, Chiefs, Bills, consecutively? Purdy lost 3 straight games, but I guess that doesn’t matter…
Yesterday doesn't delegitimize that NFC Championship at all. Our defense was miles better last year and to act like it wasn't is revisionist history
Everyone knows the 49ers would have beaten the Eagles in last year's NFC Championship game if all their QBs weren't hurt.  Most Eagles fans know that too.
As a Seahawks fan cant stand the Niners. How've Unc is right. Niners are the best team in the NFL and it isn't even close; and Purdy is the truth and should be in the MVP conversation. Gotta give props where its due...
Facts ,,Facts,,Facts Steven A is spittin’‼️‼️‼️‼️
Eagles played a contender and got exposed. Cowboys were robbed game 1. A similar beatdown will take place this Sunday night 😜
*who's GOOD ENOUGH to put us in a 14-0 hole for BP to "prove himself"? 🤔. Everyone wants to see Purdy "overcome huge deficits" but with a #2 offense & #1 defense (only team with top 5 on both in the league), someone show me the squad who can put us in that hole?*
49ers won't win anything
Eagles defense was much better last year. Their linbacker's and safety's are trash. The DC and OC are worse this year too.
69ers 43 wuzzie Stephanie A... 17
Ahhh yes. The monthly Dak is amazing, until he shits the bed against a non tomato can team.
I just love when SA stays quiet..then when he does speak he says"heres the deal" and then repeats himself😅😅😅😅😅
Everything they said in this video is complete opposite of what they’ve been saying all year 😂😂😂😂
On any given sunday.
my question to the eagles is what happened? the defense started well
how is nobody talking about CMC being a contender for the MVP
5:20 - oh he!! no!  Does SAS realize this year's eagles defense ain't the same as last year's? Does he not understand that they lost 5 starters on D and they lost their coordinator?? 🙄 He sounds ridiculous. The niners d didnt even try to show up last playoff game either. Smh
The only one that can tackle in our secondary is reed Blankenship
I’m an eagles fan… we didn’t belong on the same field as them our play calling, hurts holding too long with the ball, our defense has only 4 good players and they’re on the d line… top to bottom the 49ers are better #truthhurts #angrybird
Lol..Dan sitting up here talking bout refe and Kansas reciever getting tackled b4 ball there on no pass interference n bad flags...plz..that's every cowboy game..eagles tackled Ferguson on 1 inch goal line b4 catch he said nothing about cowboys n bad flags...same old thing with espn biased anylyst...if cowboys lose team is horrible if eagles giants Kansas city bengals patriots anyone it was not enough at wide reciever bad refs all that bs...so sick of the bs on espn..
What's crazy is Packers offense is turning into a bit of Shannon style offense.  Defense still has issues and team is really young. But it's interesting to see how they grow.
Shannon said Mac Jones could do what Purdy is doing. I'll never forget that blasphemy
49
2 things can be true. 1: The Niners would’ve had a better shot to win that NFC Championship game last year had Purdy not gotten hurt. 2: At the same time, that Eagles team last year is not the same as this year. Watching the start of that game, it’s not insane to say that Philly likely would’ve won that title game anyway. This Eagles team is 23rd defensively with UDFA and younger, worse players playing in the middle. Last season they almost broke the ‘85 Bears sack record and were ranked 2nd defensively creating turnovers galore. The Eagles also lost their OC and DC this past offseason. Be objective. San Fran probably would’ve been sent home regardless, just by a closer margin.
Eagles have been beating teams when they weren’t at their best. This to me shows the 49ers are just coached so well that it feels like every play is gonna be a positive play. Even with all that talent, the 49ers players and coaches know their role to a T and it shows with how in sync they are. If Philly can get to their best like last year, they are pretty close and could beat San Fran
We gonna forget that Brock Purdy had a concussion when he played bad?
Stephen A claims the best ability is availability. Then makes a statement about how the eagles wouldnt have won the nfc title last year if brock was AVAILABLE the whole game. Smh.
The whole "Brock Purdy is only good when playing with a lead" narrative is baffling.  It's like saying "a team is only good when it has more points than the other team".  Well, of course.  Brock plays with a lead often cause he... makes those leads.  Get the job done early and you've got momentum the rest of the game.
Final 5 seconds of the video:  As a 49ers fan: Do I trust Purdy more than Dak Prescott [to make a game winning last minute drive]?  100000000000%. Dak has a track record of choking in HIGH STAKES (not just regular season) last minute drives. Purdy? We don't know for certain but he did put San Fran in game-winning position week 6. Gotta recognize.
I can see if Purdy got injured before the game, but he got injured in the game, the 9ers went through 4 qbs which shows their oline wasn’t good, the eagles D was way better last year, I don’t think the 9ers win that game.
Lol Stephan A like a baby. Just had to get his point across. He stayed silent n then repeated himself 😂
Darin Bland for MVP
Shannon laughing 😂😂😂
Philly better hope they win out, because I expect SF to win out.
Sometimes, it's better to be lucky than to be talented. We put Philly in their place.
All aboard the Purdy Bandwagon!  Stephen A. is a little late....lol
someone please tell me why people watch Stephen A????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
While all successful QBs benefit from a system tailored to their strengths. It’s more obvious with Purdy. I don’t see him having that much success without Kyle,that loaded roster and that system.
Im a philly fan and i knew we would lose cuz we arent perfoming too well.. I'm not a fan of our new coordinators. We were way better last year compared to this season
I feel SA and Dan argue like that a lot lol hopefully they actually like each other off the set 😅
"When San Francisco *IS HEALTHY* , they are the best" -- have they been injured all season or something?? Because I know the eagles have had key injuries all season long and yet they still pulled out more wins than anyone and against top teams, too. 🤔 Someone please help me understand this. Thank you!!   I wonder how many wins the eagles would have if they were at full strength!! 🙄
This narrative "what is Brock without Deebo and Trent" like what were the Niners without Brock in NFC championship game. Every top player is key including ... BROCK PURDY!!
Give the mvp to hill if he get 2k nobody playing better then him at any position
Purdy is only an MVP if it has to go to a QB. CMC has a better case. Tyreek has a better case. Garrett has a better case. Watt has a better case. To say "Purdy and Dak are the MVP forerunners" is basically to say, "MVP can only go to the QB, even if the QB isn't the best or most valuable player on his own team."
I see Stephen A's point...
The Niners got the job but let’s not act like the Eagles were at full strength.
The MVP award always goes to a quarterback now days. It’s truly a two man race between Brock Purdy and Dak Prescott.
BP didn’t play awful in the Minnesota and Cincy game, the defense let them down in those games.
The love for the 49ers and Cowboys is too funny. They both are still not number one seed. Can’t wait till they don’t get number 1 seed and don’t make the superbowl
KC is definitely not the same as they were last season
“What is he without Trent Williams and Deebo?!” Okay? Who is Tom Brady without Gronk, Moss, Branch, Welker, J.E, Mike Evan’s? Who is Manning without Clark, Harrison, Wayne? Could make this list all day. Every great QB to ever make an all time list has had two things. People getting open and people catching the ball, without that you get Bryce Young. Purdy still has to prove himself over time, but to knock him as he is actively doing so is ridiculous.
The 49ers are simply built to beat teams that are more physical then the eagles and cowboys division. The NFC West as a whole plays a style of football that is more smash mouth then the other eagles division. The Eagles don't do well running the ball they rely on them Jalen hurts is 7 overall this season in terms of deep passes alone. That right there tells you exactly how they built their team that won't stand up against a defense that uses complicated coverages and defensive line rotations. The Eagles aren't built tongo head to head with a physical team like the 49ers. If both teams are completely healthy the 49ers are just simply Better
Baltimore will have something to say soon but we know the media don’t give credit until we win it all again, just like the 2012/13 season
The ravens defense will tear purdy up
Don’t bring up that injury BS for Philly not trynna hear it
Christian McCaffrey gets no luv for MVP
It's kool it only matters in the playoffs 💪🏾🏈🦅🦅 we will get our lick back ✋🏾💥🤦🏾
Nah nah nah Shannon don’t praise Purdy now. You been calling him lucky and a system qb everyday for the last 60 days don’t stop now. Keep telling us he’s trash like you and Nick Wright been doing.
Imagine living in a world where a defending conference champion would beat cowboys Bills Chiefs Dolphins but loss one in that stretch 4-1! Lmao Pump the dam breaks ravens would smack this team facts over feelings. Philly would beat them if meet again.
Once again Stephen A finds a way to give a black guy the credit. Finds the 49ers defensive coordinator to give credit to. No chance if he was white would he have went out of his way to praise the 49ers defensive coordinator of all people.
Brock Purdy put up 40 Burgers on both Dak and Jalen. He already the MVP.
I agree they are rhe best team but why when philly wins a team game is it all jalen hurts but 9ers do it he goes out his way to state purdy not the mvp lmao. Im a cowboys fan not a 9ers fan.
If if was a 5th…#bangbang
Shannon is losing me. Bruh act like he made a hot take? He try too hard to be condescending. Dude hops on every team bandwagon thats winning lol. Eagles/chiefs/49ers/ bengals fan😅
Read my name
Lmao yall was just saying Brock was trash, now he the MVP..
As an Eagles fan we got beat down yesterday but last year we had a different team better Defense and better offense so to say San Fran would’ve won last year…idk about that
here we go smh Brock Purdy CANT BE AN MVP CANDIDATE because He had 3 games to prove that he was the most valuable player when his best weapons was out and he looked pedestrian and they went 0-3. enough.
My favorite stat: Niners 84 - Cowboys & Eagles 29. Nuff said!
Jalen not elite he played one good year but y'all call him elite if Jalen elite Brock is elite simple , and Dak is elite from what we seeing this year
This dude dan says "what if the chiefs didnt drop passes" after that game vs the eagles but now hes saying there aint no "what ifs" THIS DUDE IS A HYPROCRIT
You could see this coming.  Philly was overdue to get thumped, especially by a team with a huge chip on their shoulder. I'd be more concerned about losing to Dallas. This is where Philly needs to ask themselves how bad they really want this. They're still in the driver's seat, but late season losses can change everything.
Jalen had lots of time yesterday
You get paid millions of dollars. Give me a break with that they were tired crap
BANG BANG NINER GANG
Eagles are fraudulent
Feeble fans better pray to God 49ers don’t get the #1 seed. It will be 56-0.
🤣🤣 don't listen to these guys if the next team beat the 49ers they say the same thing about the next thing that's what they do week to week😅😅
If eagles when in the playoffs, they will forget all about this show today and flop right to the winning team.
Watch when they play the ravens lolol everything will change
CMC is in that MVP race.....
Of course the NFC Championship is different if the 49ers have their QB, idk if they win but I know they have a much better chance to. It would’ve been competitive. That being said, the 49ers are arguably better than last year and specifically Purdy is playing better. It’s no more a fair saying the 49ers would’ve lost even with their QB as it is saying this game means they would’ve won. Beyond that tho, the idea it was disrespectful to believe there’s a different outcome if your QB isn’t hurt is moronic, even thinking you win if your QB isn’t hurt, that’s what you’re supposed to believe. Saying it played no part in the game is what could be deemed disrespectful or at least high on your own supply delusional. Furthermore imagine having no QB, nobody is putting money on a team without a QB. The worst QB in the league is a step up from not having a QB. There’s a reason nobody runs the option/wildcat in the NFL other than for a play or two
Lotta fair weather philithy fans, the stadium was red in the fourth quarter lmao
Nah lets not act like they didnt just add chase young meanwhile we got MF on IR on both sides of the ball. Its not the same team... Lets see if they keep that same energy next time around.
The cowboys is the best team in the NFL, period ,purduy didn't do anything yesterday ,debo kettle, and the rest of the guys did it, look at the game
Another thing I love how they just keep moving the bar back when Brock proves them wrong. They didn't need to see Jalen hurts over a period of time before they called him Elite they didn't need to see Patrick Mahomes over a period of time before they called him Elite, same thing with Justin same thing with Justin Herbert and same thing with a bunch of other quarterbacks. But when the last pic of the draft proves them wrong they keep moving the bar backwards because they just don't want to admit that they were wrong
Stephen a is right. Eagles are frauds. If Purdy wasn't injured in the NFC Championship last year, it would have been 49ers/chiefs. The 49ers embarrassed the eagkes last night. The 49ers are the best team right now. Cowboys/eagles are playing for the 2nd/3rd place best team next week
5:00 that’s exactly what I was thinking! Man hurts got a Super Bowl appearance handed to him. Dak played San Fran fully healthy in playoffs and was in it
Injuries are a part of football you gotta play through it
Ravens gonna whoop them bad. Cant wait
No Christian McCaffrey for MVP?
I don’t think it’s absolute that the Niners would have won last year because the Eagles were a better team last year. Everyone knows this… so this last game doesn’t delegitimize the Eagles NFC Championship from last year. I’m a Cowboys fan and I know that take is wrong.
i had to stop halfway thru.
Ravens are literally the purple 49ers
Ravens… want all that SMOKE
So the 9ers would've been the superbowl champion 😂
lol I can’t wait til the Ravens beat the 49ers
BROCK PURDY FOR MVP
Eagles still better. Idgaf
From Mr. Irrelevant, to even be in an MVP discussion, Purdy is the man!
Didnt the Chiefs beat the niners in the superbowl? What was the excuse than?
Let’s go back to Philly and whoop them in the playoffs 50-10 😂.
I'm going to be the weakest link on the Philadelphia Eagles is the defense. You could literally see what their coverage is we're going to be prior to the snap. The thing is Philadelphia's defense is very vanilla. They haven't had to use any complex coverages or hide anything because most of the teams they play against don't run a complicated offense. The Eagles whether they're in man coverage or zone coverage they're not built to stop the 49 the 49ers simply have more talented players on offense and scheme-wise they are just way too complicated of an offence to be stopped by vanilla coverages that even a child could see
Can we stop blaming our defense for losing 3 in a row? If y’all even look at the stats you’d see how good our defense was.
To everyone now on the Niner bandwagon - don't forget their coach blew 2 super bowls
Man why the Niners wanna do this to their fanbase again?? Always a great team but never win it all
Thanks niners for returning the favor!!!!!!!  COWBOYS FAN!!!!!!
The 49ers lost 3 games in a row.   The NFL is average. There are no “best” teams anymore.
00:15 GET'M DAN lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So nice seeing the overexposed Kelce brothers both eat it in back-to-back games yesterday!
C-Mac is the MVP
I disagree, the Eagles had better LB’s last year. The result would’ve been the same in last year’s NFC championship game because the 49ers couldn’t stop the Eagles.
If Purdy gets it, probably gonna be the first and only time a "Mr Irrelevant" wins an MVP...period!!!
Christian McCaffrey should be the MVP frontrunner
You don’t win titles from people calling you the “best team”. This whole proclamation is nothing more than tv fodder.
WHO CARES about MVP? means nothing!
CMC for MVP too
Yall been praising philly all year and you could tell they werent as good as their record.
Eagles are not the team as the last yr team…and our coordinators aren’t the same caliber as last. Good game though
Blah blah blah all this JAZZ.. let’s see if my team doesn’t take this hype and have some championship medal and stay humble and keep their grind to the wheel and play ball and act like they didn’t win the SB beating the eagle like they did Dallas
Oh now we change the way we Speak about My Niner's!! Try to tell y'all last year. Our QB was injured. The Game would have not been close.
Best point on Purdy. He drove the ball down the field against a tough Browns defense and set them up to win.
When you are soooo good that you dominate from the start, you don't NEED to play from behind or prove anything.
My boy Dan standin on bizzz
Love Listening to this!!you can see the testosterone flying between these guys! Love the healthy debates yet it seems like they are saying the same thing. Niners are AWESOME!!!
Tyreek?? How about Lamar goofy
Dan needs to stop with the over acting. Act like an adult, you don’t need to cover your face or turn around for attention after every point.
"Hate" is a strong word, Dan! Ha,ha!
so when does purdy become elite? how many big games must he win? how many great performances must he put up for you to believe he’s great?
5:00 FACTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I SAID IT ALLLLLLL LAST SEASON!!!!!!
Eagles got smacked 😂😂😂. AT HOME too.
Brock is the best qb in the league right now. Even in the losses, he wasn't horrible. If anything, the defense and special teams were the reason for those losses.
They talking like it's the super bowl lmao smh. Eagles just needed a wake up call. Still will win superbowl
Shannon being hypocritical again
CMC needs to be in the MVP convo as well
What Dan O said about Trent, Deebo and McCaffrey's health being paramount is why Purdy is not elite and why he maybe should not be MVP.
Molly told Dan nice tie and SAS immediately started dirty macking 😭
Both these teams will choke when it counts. Boring game by trash teams.
Eagles offensive line was still dominant in pass protection yesterday. Coverage sacks did happen yesterday.   - 49ers Fan
DAN O IS FULL OF 🧢🧢🧢🧢 NO ONE EXPECTED THE EAGLES TO GET BLOWN OUT AT HOME BEING 23-3 AT HOME IN THE LAST TWO SEASONS
Where were the arguments this year since the Niners play FOUR TEAMS off the bye week. Lots of excuses for the eagles right now.
Na last year it wasn’t the same. Different teams. We moved the ball with no problems against that defense. Obviously if Purdy never got hurt it would have been closer. But stop the cap
Both eagles, coordinators need to be fired immediately.
I shocked Shannon said that Dak and prudy Dan got to be on 🔥 about that statement
DAM.  You guys act like it world wAR 3.😂😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣😊😊😊😊😊😭😭😭😭
starting from 3:48 why does stephen talk like can’t nobody tell him nothin he can’t even be wrong in the slightest way i would’ve been dude who tf are u talkin to like that
Nick Wright on suicide watch if Purdy wins MVP 😂
Stephen A needs to go watch this game again. He refuses to give credit to Brock Purdy and Niners. I watched him talk on First take and on Pat McAfee show, same old speech.
This game has nothing to do with last year. Last year the eagles d was way better. Sas reaching now for narratives lol
Ravens > 49ers
Until they play the Ravens 😈
This comparison to last year is ridiculous. The eagles have two new coordinators. The offensive one is a massive downgrade from last season to now. We also had the league leader in tackles at LB last season in TJ edwards who we don’t have anymore and not to mention Hargrove who was one of our best interior lineman last season now plays for the Niners! Then you factor in no CJ Gardner Johnson this season either and it’s not the same teams. Far from it. This year the Niners clearly look better there’s no denying that
https://youtu.be/fcL_TPqITj4?si=Wf1KrPSA7HDiB-Dr  ESPN’s coverage of Dana White vs Von Miller
Every week finds a new way to call a new team the best lol he just said jags were the best last week lol he wants to be clipped so bad everyday
Svck it Eagles fans 😂
The Eagles have NO chance against the Cowboys this week. Dallas will dominate and CRUSH Philly next week.
Man give Tyreek Hill should be top 2 or 3 for MVP
How did they miss a tackle on Purdy, that was the game in a microcosm.
Dan is clown
purdy can do it but his team so good they can beat when healthy
So, Purdy throws a few dump off passes that his WR take to the house, and he’s the MVP? Again, these ppl don’t know how to isolate the player’s individual talent from the TEAM’S success. Literally any other no-name, MID QB (Jimmy G) would be doing what he’s doing. Shanahan has a great scheme. Idk how tho. It’s been years and nobody can figure it out? Give me a break.
I was a little nervous after that scuffle and stupid ejection of Greenlaw. I said to myself, oh here it is, the check the refs got from Philly finally cleared as they always get calls their way. The answer from the Niners was a thing of beauty. It put a silence in the Link and humbled that arrogant Eagles team. They got manhandled, something I did not think I would see. If Dallas beats Philly, I still think Philly will get the number 1 seed with their cupcake schedule in the final 3 games, 2 of which against my hapless Giants.
This isn’t the same Eagles team. The players lost in the offseason. The Coordinators lost in the offseason. We have a whole new LB corps, who are both hurt. So no. They beat them last year. But lost last night.
Ngl I sat through the whole video and didn’t disagree 🫡
Philly's o-line actually played well I thought. Jaylen just held the ball way too long.
The problem with Stephen A.'s argument is that the Eagles are weaker on defense this year than they were last year. Even with their starting QB, the Niner's would have lost last year because it was the EAGLES who took Purdy out of the championship game anyway. Injuries are part of the game. Would San Francisco be crying today if Purdy got crushed by Jalen Carter or Graham and was out of the game? The Eagles took the Nine's apart LAST year. This year is obviously a different story.
Brock Prudy or Dak Prescott....ill take either one
Dan contradicted TF outta himself, by saying there's a lot of QBs that would perform LESSER without 1 of the best LTs in 🏈 and without 1 of the best playmakers in 🏈 ( and the best rb)....but disregarded how many QBs would perform better with those same players than Brock😂 🤦🏾‍♂️.....The man is a 🤡 that's famous for running out of the end zone for a safety on 🦃 day😂😂😂😂
The Ravens are the best team in the NFL. I stand by this statement.
Just give them the superbowl now
McCaffrey is above Dak in the MVP race.
If your Eagles fan the lost doesn’t surprise you. We know it was coming
We put up 42 points against Dallas and Philadelphia. Don't want to hear Purdy is fools gold again
Niners do have the best team in the league, but lets not forget that the games are played on the field. Overconfidence can be a killer. Shanahan should take care of that.
Of course it proves they were suppose to be their last year. Eagles are utter trash that got lucky injuring Purdy
Just last week yall was on my boi hurts. The defense has a bad game n yall take away that LAST week of yall saying he has the mvp race locked? Boi I tell u, about u sports analysts. We r 10-2. With a cake walk for the rest of the season. 😏 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Aww, we all know that the 49ers are just lucky, the Eagles and Cowboys just had a bad game against them, and Brock Purdy really hasn’t proven himself against a really good team in a come from behind situation.  After all, nobody wanted him until 262 choices were made.  He even threw a pick 6 last week.   Terrible but lucky to have good players around him.   Pundits should be wary about his winning ways and apply to work at CNN fake news as a sports analyst.
SALUTE FIRST TAKE ! ❤
Purdy lead them on a game winning drive against Cleveland. Kicker lost it.
The 49ers are the best team. Keep everyone healthy they will win the superbowl. 😊
Where was all this testosterone about SF doing that 3 gm lost??? LOL!!!! These pundits blow with the wind every weekend LOL!!!
Don’t the Eagles need a new GM, a new coach, a new OC and DC? The Eagles need to do this to be able to undergo the rebuild needed to compete at a championship level
Jalen Hurts was knocked out of the MVP race yesterday. He doesn’t have a chance of being considered in 2023, maybe never in the future as well. Now we can see Hurts has been way overrated.
I agree that the 49ers are the best team in the NFL but it doesn’t guarantee them the Super Bowl. The playoffs is where it count the most. I am a Cowboys fan but I am speaking for all playoff bound teams
For the season MVP..Stroud has to be heavily and at least in the top 3 at this point
So it means nothing the eagles just played 5 straight games of monsters having to give it all every week
I can’t wait till the playoffs and we bounce back
Deebo is a bully like in  the movie
Why is it private?
Might be the unpopular take for MVP but Christian McCaffrey being a candidate cannot go understated
The Eagles are done. The 49ers hit them hard enough to knock them out - KO. End of season, possibly end of many seasons ahead for Eagles.  Howie Roseman is way overrated. Maybe the Eagles have to move on and clear house in Philly, including the GM
49ers played against 3rd & 4th string defensive players. 😂😂😂. The same thing happen to 49ers last yr. Thats what they were complaining about yet taking a victory lap for doing the same. 😂😂😂 all you ppl are silly
at 0:25 shannon was about ready to say "SKIP SKIPP SKIPPP SKIPPPP!!"
Preach Stephen A. Preach!
49ers would have won the Superbowl last season
Goofies
I get Stephen A point but it wasn’t the same Eagle team last year.  Safety and linebackers are totally different.  Coordinators aren’t the same and the offense this year has taken a step back. San Francisco has proven they the favorites this year though.
If Lamar and the ravens beat the 49ers, I want to hear Shannon Sharpe D ride Lamar like he’s doing Brock Purdy if he doesn’t is a clear indication that that man don’t like the skin his in I’m sorry
#victory #monday #49ers
NEW OC  NEW DC  HALF OF THE DEFENSE LOST  NOT THE SAME TEAM.
"Health concern..." come on, EVERY team has a health concern. If KC loses their QB, season over. Ravens lose their QB, over. Miami loses the cheetah, more than likely is over. Health is very important, IMO.
SAS didn’t mention eagles Oline. If you gave that oline to Purdy. He’ll do better than Hurt. 4-5sec avg vs 2max… sometime it feels like he was there for 10sec and dude still can’t make a play with 2 number 1 WR? Embarrassing
Joke:  How good the Niners be if they had an "Elite" QB?  LMFAO.
Only First Take can make it sound like an argument when everyone agrees.
Don't discount the 49ers depth... If McCaffrey goes down, Elijah Mitchell is really good... If Bosa or Young goes down we got Randy Gregory to fill in.
Dee bo is obviously the mvp of this team
Wait till they see the Ravens Defense the Real birds Gon Handle business
Why are we acting like Brock Purdy last year would perform like Brock Purdy this year. And why are we acting like the Eagles aren’t the reason they were down QB after QB? Eagles defense (who lost multiple players this year) blew that offense TF UP. We all watched Philly straight dominate that championship game from the on set. That’s why the QB’s went down.
You can’t say that Stephen A.… they are not the same team. Stop it 🛑
I don't get how someone can get an MVP of the league award while not even being the most valuable player on their team🤔
I’m glad Shannon did a complete 360 on the Niners. Stephen A’s too quiet to say anything. Well Dan you deserve the W bruh welcome back, these dudes don’t even watch the game with a sober eye without being biased against Purdy. Smh
FlyeaglesFly we still got the best record in the league
Our Niners style of play is dominant, but it does tend to increase injury rates... Hopefully we CAN stay healthy to show we're built to be Champs!!! #ForeverFaithful #BangBangNinerGang
Am an eagles fan we got bullied yesterday but let’s not act like eagles wasn’t missing their TE and their 2 best LB but no excuses hope we meet that team in the playoffs
Eagle fans deserve this
Im neither fan of either team but it doesn't matter in the regular season its the playoff that matters
Mahomes played 15 games and was called elite so why not Purdy?
Horrible take, this year's eagles is not last years eagles and this year's 49ers is not last year's 49ers.....we lost all our linebackers all our safeties our slot corner and we gave them one of our best defensive tackles....these are not excuses but they are just not the same teams
Unc gotta apologize. He called that man a game manager and replaceable. He is the currently the front runner for MVP
Now pay attention. Has anybody looked at the Super Bowl logo color yet? It is the color of san francisco and the color of baltimore Raven. Every year They have 2 colors in their Super Bowl logo, and so far It has been 99.9% accurate on who going to the superbowl. Makes me wonder if it's fixed or if someone knows the future.😮
Lol if the Eagles beat the cowboys it will be a new two horse race for mvp purdy and hurts lol. It’s fluid! Lmao
Jalen Hurts fell off with the best record in NFL? are you all dumb. May i remind you 49ers also lost to Vikings and Browns and the Cowboys lost to cardinals and Jalen's Eagles & Brocks 49ers too. So Dak is NOT in the convo
You could argue Stephen A just delegitimized himself bringing this bullsh*t up about last year's NFC champ game. Knocking the QB out of the game is a good thing..? He didn't injure himself? Wow.
Said it all year if Philly keep playing how they was playing we would win. People kept saying they playing superbowl football. True but you can’t go the whole season winning by a touchdown or less. At some point you’re going to lose
All the pressure is on the 49ers for the rest of the year. If they don't get to the SB, don't make any excuses. Life if different when the bright lights are on you and you get every team's best punch.
SAS is a blow hard trying to cook up insights into the game that his NFL playing compatriots have real experience and knowledge.
What’s mahomes without a seasoned wide receiver? We just saw that against the packers and against the eagles. Stop with “if Brock Purdy didn’t have” argument. No qb can win on their own without weapons and a good O-Line
3 games in 13 days can we relax
UNC YOU WAS DRINKING TOO MUCH HENNY LAST NIGHT! RAVENS THE BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE!
NfC is better than the AFC.
49ers will choke in the playoffs or SB.
Patrick Mahomes was considered elite after two seasons. So why can’t Purdy? Cause he is white?
Bro Shannon is lying on national tv. This dude definitely said Brock was a system qb, replacement level Qb and he was not all that. Now it’s “we’ve seen Qbs in that system and they weren’t Brock Purdy” ok Shannon I thought you were call it like you see it? CAP
I still don’t believe that 49ers would beat the eagles last year if purdy was healthy I think that we were a way better team last year then this year we just need the coordinators just need to do better
To take away what the eagles did last year is complete bs it’s not the same team on our side we lost the players on our defense that made our defense on the backend
Also can we stop with the what if Brock Purdy was in Houston or Cleveland?
Stephen A is mad mad .. HAHAHAHA!!
It's time for WHEEL-OF-EXCUSES (Philly Edition) 1)	49ers had 3 more days of rest 2)	The 49ers got to play with a QB this time (not fair) 3)	The field was wet (on our side only) 4)	Referees 5)	But but but the 49ers lost 3 games in a row 6)	Trumpsters 7)	Aliens!
You can't say the niners belonged in the super bowl last year and not the Eagles because Jalen hurts bawled out and had one of the best performances by a quarterback in a super bowl, Yes we lost but don't act like we didn't belong there
eaglirls were screaming Cowboys suck after every game instead of worrying about the team in front of them. Now look at them.
Best roster & best coaches but they were down two men & lost 3 straight .. that makes no sense.
Media was waiting for this one. Hungry dogs run faster. Go birds
Give the Brock credit! The 49ers were trailing 6-0 early in the first quarter. We didn't come out with guns blazing. It was a slower-than-ideal start, but once Brock found his groove, it was game over. Down 6 points is still playing from behind, especially with how AJ Brown was torching the middle of the field in the first quarter.
How do you watch that game and have Brock as the MVP? Deebo and Trent Williams were the best players on the field lol
WHO IS THE JERKY WHITE GUY??
The difference btw my eagles and 49ers is jalen can play without his good player we won without our te vs bills plus lane johonson didn’t play either but the question is can prudy do good without debo ? I accept the lost we gottta be better no excuses #playoff #mode
Hurts was concussed this game and still foolishly tried to play.  Dallas will knock him out next week and philly fans will cry foul for going after their qb.  Eagles will be lucky to get a wildcard spot.
I love stephen A
It’s up to the Ravens to knock the hype out a little we still got two weeks of business to take care first
49ers deserve a chip this year , they got robbed last year by injuries
As a Niner fan, hearing Stephen A confirm what literally every fan and team member has said all year, that the Super Bowl last year should have been 49ers v Chiefs, is so euphoric
the eagles didn’t play to the standard. two trips to the redzone and cashed 6 points in total. this wasn’t the game to have redzone woes, especially seeing the way the defense was playing to start. but that’s why the game got out of hand, 6 points is not going to beat the niners
People relate the 3 loses to the health of williams and debo as the only issue.  1.  Clev game, referre called a bogus call with 4 minutes left that should have been game over for cleveland but the refs handed them that game, so Purdy drives the team down the field for a field goal shot in UNDER 2 minutes - PURDY DID HIS JOB.  The Kicker missed the winning FG, but the Ref gave it away to begin with.  2.  Minn - Purdy played great for 3 quarters, without Williams, without Deebo - Purdy cannot play defense too, the Defense had no answer for Minn.  Deebo and Williams do not play defense.  THEN Purdy got a concussion and should have came out of the game sooner.  3.  Bengals - Purdy came off concussion protocol WITHOUT even 7 days rest, there is no way he was ready with that concussion.  Those three loses are NOT Williams and Deebo issues, INJURY issue, YES, Purdy had a concussion that wasn't fully healed.
I agree that if the 49ers can stay healthy, I don’t see any team beating them in the playoffs or Super Bowl. SF49ers have put a beat down on Philadelphia and Dallas this year😮
Lenoir hit on Swift was outrageous and it should be a fumble... 😃
Brock is trash when his back is against the wall! He blessed to have a superstar filled team.
Still always find away to hate on my team what if this or that happens what if there down last time I checked we was done and couldn’t move the ball an inch in the first quarter but did that bother brock nope they need to stop with the bs niner gang
The “If we were healthy argument” is finally proven to the birds fans 🔴🟤
Sorry but i never hype up a regular season game its pointless cause watch when playoffs come eagles will beat them again
49ers: 11 days rest Eagles: 3-1verses title contenders....
If Hurts ends the year with the best record in the league playing with a defense that's played terrible, how is he not MVP? I get it, the Niners smacked the Eagles, but don't rob this man Hurts again.
Why is Shannon and Steven so critical of Purdy?
Brock Purdy MVP?? are you kidding me?
They seen the truth that's all
😂
Ward and Greenlaw are the difference on defense.
nobody talks about rest when the 9ers lost 3 games 2 of which were teams coming off a bye, no excuses then! 9ers knew who the Eagles were and showed them
Brock party is legit. People say he's not good when he doesn't have his all-pro left tackle Trent Williams and Deeboo. Trent is going to the hall of fame, he's that good. Ninners offense of line is ranked in the bottom 11 in the NFL. If Trent is done and Deebo is gone who is also a great blocker as a Wide receiver. What to you think the offensive line is without those two????? Brock is LEGIT!!!!!
The sky isn’t falling the Eagles will be ok
8:55 never forget Dan said baker would do almost the same thing as purdy in this system 😂 the moxy to call out Shannon is so ignorant
I cannot wait to watch speak today to  see what shady and Joy has to say about this!!! Lol
I am also tired of hearing about the Eagles having 3 games in 13 days.  The three games that the Niners played prior were 3 games in 11 days...  Guess what the one all three and then had a few extra days and demolished the Eagles.
Did Brock not start at a Deficit last night?  Minus yards at the end of the 1st Q.
Tyreek hill is the mvp
Stephen A. Smith.. BRAVO!!!!!!!
Right..I’m a Niners fan and I hate Hasan Reddick. I pray the worst for that slimey mofo. Injured our qb. Niners would have killed them in nfc championship. They won cause they took out our qb. Sadly we don’t got depth there but man Purdy plays nothing can stop us. Purdy. Trent. Deebo. Those 3 are the life blood of the team. This is a very talented team. Can’t wait for Super Bowl
Playing 3 games in 13 days is crazy vs having a team having a 10 day rest..js
I’m not surprised by the loss #eagles the line was solid secondary was present but the LBs were getting gashed all game by a lot of underneath routes bubble screens n McCaffery got to the second level every touch #ijs they have to address the poor LB play if they want a chip
Didn't give the Niners excuses when they lost their 3 games but here comes everything for the eagles smh haters everywhere
Dak Prescott isnt the MVP if he loses to Philly next week.
Shannon Sharpe is irritating... any which way the flag blows is where he goes.... GEEZ pick a side... stay consistent.
The Eagles talent on offense is what has been keeping them in games. The OC is hot garbage with his playcalling. The defense outside of the defensive front has been trash all season and Sean Desai' schemes don't help.
Tell me you're wrong, without telling me you're wrong....  Shannon:  Blah blah blah.
The problem with the no qb argument last year is the Eagles knocked the qb out they didn't come in without him!!TlThe 49ers couldn't block the pass rush!!!
It's time to rename MVP to MVQ since it's impossible for non-QB's to win the award.
If ravens play there best football nobody beats them bro
Everyone says Purdy can't play from behind YET everyone forgets ( except Dan) that Purdy brought the 49ers back against the Cleveland  Browns in the last two minutes of the game BUT Jake Moody missed the game winning FG with time running out.    PURDY is only getting better.
Brock would've only lost 2 games. If his kicker would've made that field goal. He put them in a position to win and his kicker let him down.
S.a.s. why didn't they have a QB in that NFC championship game though? Obviously means that the O-line stunk and is better now and the Eagles lost both OC/DC; 1 team improved and the other regressed
all this hype & the 49ers still not gone be in the superbowl.. 🥴
Unsung heroes of this game are the Niners Dbacks. Granted that both Eagles wr had over 100 yards but Jalen had plenty of time to throw the ball and couldn't convert 3rd downs when it mattered.
Preach sir Steven
First time in NFL History: CO MVP's from the same team = Purdy / McCaffrey    Heard it here first...
lol Kittles attitude will cost them.Trent Williams before week 17 for the rest of playoffs book it
What what was sickening to me was to see the way football fans (49ers) were treated by philly fans going into the stadium and outside was disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves
Great segment 👍
Has a Cowboys fan Deebo Samuels is another Shannon Sharpe
Ravens ... all they do is dominate dam near every body
Brock Purdy over Tyreek Hill for MVP???? Are you serious
San fran fans out here like they won the superbowl. Last i checked yall are still 2nd in the nfc.
The disrespect pointed towards Purdy is so insane. They're all clowns.
PURDY IS NOT MVP ! He’s only playing like this because of the players around him . If you put Tua or Kirk in his position they would still play the same .
Molly.........Nice outfit
They gave 49ers and giving the cowboys both 10 days to get ready for the eagles
49ers lost those three games because of their defense, not Brock Purdy. Purdy actually played great in the Viking game until he was concussed, and played equally as well in the Bengal game.
Purdy is a game manager at best!  If he's on any other team in the league he's not good!  Giving him his props he's an amazing game manager and accurate passer!
Why is the 92 snaps to 10 days even need to be said? It’s a Sunday to Sunday game. You can say the same about having to play Thursday after playing a Sunday the week prior. No excuses. Period. Dot.
these analysts be so bias, shannon was just hating on purdy two weeks ago 😭
The Eagles have been over-rated by the trend-following ESPN talking-heads all season.  The Eagles are the equivalent of the 1980s Dan Fouts Chargers.  A one-dimensional team that can't play defense as they are #29 in the NFL in defensive points-per-drive surrendered -- only the Commanders, Broncos and Cardinals are worse.  The 49ers are the class of the NFL, second best are the Cowboys.   Both those teams did some stumbling, but over-all they're better as they both have Top-5 offenses AND Top-5 defenses.
Molly shhhhhhhhhhhhhhj
It’s the niners year it’s not even close
Molly at 7:17 “he’s trying to say they might not have gotten there” SAS is completely right, sure injuries are part of the game but 4 QBs?? Not 1 QB could play that championship game to advance to Super Bowl, with how Niners defense looked last year with DeMeco Ryans they certainly could’ve made issues for Patrick who was dealing with ankle/foot issues. Deebo went to first take n stood on the eagles weren’t that much better than them, his team was just handicapped. Their defense was still keeping the Niners in the game but with nothing else to do but run the ball what else was gonna happen. I’m glad they showed out cuz they definitely woulda won vs Philly last year…Deebo talked n back up his words too 💪🏽
The MVP race changes every Sunday. Last week Hurts is the clear favorite and now it’s Dak and Purdy(who wasn’t even considered) lol I get it’s entertainment but man they flip flop like fish out of water
People keep saying that the Eagles secondary has injuries... Hello the 49ers have lost both or their starting safeties but no one mentions that.
I'm with Stephen A
Well, let’s put it like this since they was crying so much that they’re QB was hurt and if he would’ve been good, they would’ve went to the Super Bowl. Supposedly I bet you if we had are defense  fully healthy last night game would’ve been one of the ages because 4 key players on are defense are out
Mollys  voice issssssssss?
McCafferey should be high on MVP list
When Brock, CMC, Trent and Deebo play an entire game, 49ers are undefeated. That’s crazy 😳
As a eagles fan it’s infuriating that we have a good run game yet we don’t use it until it’s needed we are a run first offense why are we passing so much
That's a different defense
Cj stroud in the mvp race too.  I'm a niner fan and I'm not going to hate on greatness in cj.
All this talk of put the Niners in a deficit, make Purdy beat you, is all well and good. But you still need to actually go out there and do it, you need to slow down that offense and put up points on that defense. Good luck
Stephen A deserves 🖕🖕 for saying this takes away frm Philly's NFC title last yr. How does it?? This is the same 49ers team frm last with with added depth on the line. This is NOT the same Philly team frm last yr. New OC and DC, lost both LBs, RB, S. Went frm a top 3 defense to arguably a bottom 5 defense that can't cover a paralyzed person with a blanket or tackle. Deebo had 116 yds....115 were AFTER THE CATCH according to Next Gen stats. Played frm behind week after week and out gained by 100+ week after week. It caught up to them Sunday. This is their wake up call.
#phillybias is real...
The 49ers had the Eagles fans booing their 10-1 team going into half time. By the 4th quarter, most of the stands was a sea of red. Fly Deebo Fly #BirdGauntlet 2-0
this game the refs were great; they let them play; not calling the chinsey pass interferences; Phily has a great offensive line; no one could get to Hurt; he had all day; thanks refs for letting them play;
Shut up Molly - peter Griffin voice
Shannon literally said the exact opposite last week. Way to flip.
SF is the clear cut #1 and it's not really even close.   Philly has been overrated for weeks, lots of lucking into wins.   And Hurts has been stat padding TD's with the tush push....Mariota picked up a first down with the play too.
Calm down. Brock Purdue is garbage if Deebo is out of the line up. If Deebo gets hurt, they’re done.
That's a terrible take from SAS. Yes, Niners are the same team, but Eagles are not. That defense has not looked ferocious like last year, the offense isn't explosive at all.. SAS has been waiting for the Eagles to have a bad game like this.
Thanks unc Shay for finally admitting nobody in the nfl can match up with us niner gang we the best
Philly losing is what happens when the organization does not invest in good young talented linebackers that are durable and not on IR every month. RBs and TEs just run through the defense. Just getting by at this position isn't good enough anymore. At least get one LB that's good and durable for heavens sake.
Philadelphia was playing angry. You can't do anything right out of anger. I would say Deebo won this game for the 9ers with what he said during the week.
What if Dak Prescott get into a deficit what's the difference Purdy has a better team around him purdy is not better than dak in my opinion. Debo and McCaffrey away from him he would just be average
Get Molly outta here she interrupts just to hear her own voice
Shannon is a clown he hate on the eagles every chance he get. He only said something good when we forced him to based on results
4 TDs and 300+ yards on the #1 team in the league and they still disrespecting Purdy.  People just can't get over that they were wrong about him.
The Nfc has a 3 man race for MVP actually: Purdy, Prescott, Christian McCaffrey
Purdy and Dak mvp and Lamar isn't in the convo? FOH we'll see them on Christmas
Purdy is trash 🗑️ he got an weak arm , 49er ain’t no good team, look at the eagles record  10 -2 lol ,chiefs lost too ,this only they 2nd lost  relax, sf has easy schedule then the eagles 🦅 purdy couldnt win , without stars player hurts ,so he not an good QB ,if you’re can’t lead your team too wins , without your weapons, then you’re not an great QB , pat won an chip without hill , 49er need an dream team just for purdy to win
If Brock purdy hadn’t got injured in that championship game last season it would’ve have been a chiefs vs eagles SB
Those goes Shannon an his hypothetically  thinking..😂😂😂
Wilks got that RESPECT!!!
49ers had -6 yards of offense after the 1st quarter! Down 0-6, so dont tell me Brock cant play from behind!   Several players wore black because we came for the Eagles funeral and we buried those birds! The Juan Jennings TD was the last rites of the game!   Hurts was running like he stole something and he had the #1 OL  Stop bringing Dak into this MVP discussion as Brock beat the brakes off him H2H when the 49ers beat the Cowboys! BP leads DP in QBR, passer rtg, yards/att, TDs, INTs, air yards. Dak has yards vs losing teams. Brock has yards against winning teams.   Another metric that is never brought up in the mvp. Dak Prescott is getting paid $30-40 million behind a top 5 offensive line, Brock is paid $870,000 and is playing behind a bottom 10 OL. Now look at the salary, look at the protection and look at the stats, bear in mind the records are the same! Brock is more valuable than Dak based on salary alone, that increases when you consider the protection he gets and increases further you look at the QB metrics   This isnt even a discussion, they are siding with Dak because he is the Cowboys QB and they are Americas team and they need the ratings!!!  I have no faith in SAS or Unc for objectivity!!!   Shame
We all seen this coming. EAGLES fans included. Bt we'll see them back in the Linc for a grudge match
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Still hating on Brock smh but y’all give QBs like Justin Herbert hella praise 😒
😮‍💨 Shannon had me worried after that 🐎 take
I think the eagles have been sus all year they handled business when they needed but they have had a bunch of good breaks going their way
#MVPurdy
NBA PICKS TODAY 12/4/23 FREE PICKS
49ers vs Cowboys, must have!!! Dan Quinn must come up with a hellafied game plan!!!! Tackling is a must!!!
49ers are STACKED.  They have the Best RB, DE, LT, MLB in the NFL.  Top tier QB, WR, and TE.
Deebo said they woulda blown them out if Purdy never got hurt. And I’ll be damned he wasn’t lying 😂
How is Purdy the Favorite after  losing 3 straight without deebo if anything CMC or Deep is MVP
If Moody kicks a 41 yard field goal, nobody would be talking about the ability to come back.
How should the NFL handle teams who have a water boy or a security guard pick a fight with a player from the opposing team so they both get ejected?
Eagles just beat the chiefs and the Bills 😂 you expect them the beat the niners too or else we are bad huh? It's crazy how quickly people jump bandwagons Eagles will be back 💯🦅
Niners have the best Talent on offense and defense! Blownout 4 Teams with Great records so they are the BEST TEAM
Recency bias Dak MVP ahead of Hurts because Eagles lost? 49ers and Eagles beat Cowboys too
Lenoir took the soul right outta swift and sent that boy to the shadow realm lmao😂😂😂😂😂
Where were the Refs to bail these Egirls out again?
During the 49ers losing streak, Sharpe didn't believe in Purdy saying, "I told you so." Now he's saying Purdy is leading the MVP race. Orlovsky is contradictory. He says Purdy is all-world and criticizes Smith and Sharpe for saying Purdy needs a lead to perform. Yet, he says Dak is leading the MVP race. These guys are fools.
stop hatin steve haha
They praised Hurts last week. This week he fell off and no longer in mvp conversation
Shannon Sharpe should host a TEDTalk about avoiding the issue. Stephen A. has the gall to talk about consistency. 🤣  MVPurdy. 🏆
Dan is actually wrong both teams. Both teams are equally as talented. 49ers and Eagles match up well on TALENT, the issue is coaching. Last year the coaching was still almost even but I'd give a nod to 49ers cause Kyle's staff has been there longer. This year it isn't the same. 49ers lost Demeco Ryans and didn't skip a beat, Eagles lost Jonathon Gannon, and Shane, and have fallen apart.
First of all  Eagles were the better team last year hands down stop making excuses
Oh they was tired riiight riiight
I resent the comments about last year - this eagles defense cannot stand up to last years team... stop the comparison
Now they get to say last year was luck smfh
49secs in & Dan got me rolling 😂
I feel like Stephen A has racial bias in how he treats other analysts
Go 49ers
I'm so tired of people not giving Purdy the credit he Justly Deserves...  All the talent on the 49's is 100% true... however, who is the guy, getting the ball to the players so they have a chance to be the best they can be?  Who's that guy?  Purdy! Sooner or later, (probably after superbowl) people will be like, ya he's a great quarterback...  Wake up and smell the coffee, the 49's are a "team" focused players...
That was the Super Bowl for the 49ers. They will meet again before the season is over
Eagles had a chance in the 1st half to put up atleast 3 touchdowns, the 49ers start was terrible but eagles did not  get the job done ,49ers climbed out the whole FROM BEHIND, down 6 and dominated
But yall cant just keep saying can he come from behind, the games he couldn’t come from behind were trent and deebo was out, two huge key players even maybe the best on the offense, that browns game purdy cant kick the ball for the kicker
Love the camaraderie, especially in the right dosage. This is why we watch the show🥰
Dan needs to go
The Eagles just seemed to give up on life in that game.
the field goal kicker lost one of those games for Purdy.  Yesterday, Purdy could have folded after the first quarter when the team had -16 yards and zero completions.  Instead, he took the team on 6 straight touchdown drives.
1 of the 49ers draft picks they traded for Lance was Micah Parsons, imagine Parsons on the 49ers? And now Lance is on Dallas, how ironic 😅
I love how the Purdy negative is "when his left tackle, defensive linemen and best weapons are out he struggles"  Yes just like every other elite qb.
Steve Wilks should send David Tepper a great Christmas present. He didn't need that headache, and he'd already be looking for a job.
SF was down in that game, SA.
Stop saying that the Niners would've beat the Eagles last year if Purdy was healthy...just stop. As an eagles fan, this year's philly team is not nearly as good as last years...we lost BOTH our coordinators and a number of defensive players from last year (CJGJ, Epps, Suh, etc.). No excuse for the beatdown we took from the niners but these issues have been persisting all year...last year we werent having these issues...case closed. stop playing with these "what ifs". the niners beat THIS YEAR's eagles team. not last years. period.
Stephen A. Is talking out his a** like seriously straight tripping saying garbage like that bout last year what a idiot
Eagles has the easiest path to the Super Bowl in nfl history last year. FACT!! 🤷🏾‍♂️
Everyone with an unbiased brain knows San Fran wins last year if they had a QB, and that they would have won the Super Bowl Bowl as well.
As a Seahawk fan no matter how much hate I have for 9ers I knew  they was the best team in the league I can at least say if they win Super Bowl our division won💀😂
You guys make a e me 😂😂😂😂
Y’all still sleeping on Lamar Jackson he gon make everyone a believer this season
No tyreek hill for mvp, what about Cmac
The NFC champ game is a nauseating point. It’s two completely separate teams and it’s Kyle’s stupid self that got Purdy injured. Cry you didn’t have a QB, it’s your HC fault. It also didn’t take out your defense that got rushed all over.
Slow yall role my ravens see them in three weeks let’s talk then 😮
My squad sees the the 49ers I. 2 weeks and we are gonna beat them watch……#Ravensnation!!!!
Molly just needs to shut the fk up she’s unbearable to listen to
3 games in 14 days
Best record in nfl right now and everyone is saying they need to do better. Ok, how much better? #1, do you want them to be #0????   Maybe someone gets a better record first and then we have this conversation
Wait until the cowboys play the eagles then we’ll see if Dak is in the mvp race
Dan calling out Shannon I love it 😂😂
Every week it’s somebody new that’s the best team in football lol
Orlovsky trust Prescott more than Purdy
Much respect for the niners.  I said they would demolish the eagles and they did. Phillys defense isn't as good as people think. Niners defense shut down aj brown, have to give love ❤️  for that. Go niners😂
eagles got EXPOSED😂😂
The Eagles can be at full health 10 weeks of rest, and everyone said their prayers the night before..  If the 49ers are healthy, no one is beating them..   Browns loss ( No CMC Kicker missed) Vikings (concussion, no Deebo, no Trent) Bengals (concussion No Deebo, No Trent) Yet Brock still played well.
I said it last year but people wanna make it seem like this a new thing now. The Eagles had one of the easiest routes to a Super Bowl ever. They faced a Giants team that honestly overachieved and we see where they are now. Then faced a 49ers team that were going to expose them but their starting  QB gets injured on the first play and they lose their backup QB in the next half. A healthy 49ers team is way better than the Eagles. Also stop with the Lamar hate, I’ll give you Purdy but Dak is not in front of him for MVP.
Stephen A gets AF over Molly
hes not mvp Race rn its still between hurts and lamar and maybe cheetah
Why can’t a defensive player win MVP?
They were criticizing Brock earlier in the season when they were losing 😆.
Leave it to Shannon to mention the Cowboys unprompted. Rent free
I never hear anything about Jalenz Hrtz turnovers.  He has arguably the best O line, studs at receiver, and a top 5 defense.  These clowns are always trashing Josh Allen because of his lack of melanin
San Fran is the best team in The NFL hands down 🫡🫶🏾🐐👏🏾🥶☝🏾💯
I feel like you have to be elite to be the MVP, I like Tyreek for MVP this season
The 49ers went so hard because this was their super bowl 😂 Nobody took this game serious but them. Let’s have this conversation in the Playoffs when it really counts
49ers are the most talented team in the NFL. When they are on point, they can beat any team by double digits
Exactly what we been saying for a year.
Dan keeps bringing up the Cleveland game missed FG. Never says they got in FG range with 2 PI's
Shannon changing his mind on Purdy 🤦‍♂️
Welcome to reality First Take!!!! Philly are a TOUGH team, to beat them by 3 TDs was a major achievement but its only one game! We may well meet again the playoffs! Now its a rivalry!
All these days... i dont see how no one has gone off on Molly for bluntly interruping them day in and day out smdh
I want to hear what Haason Reddick have to say BOOHOOHOOoo 😂🤣😂
Dak Prescott versus Brock Purdy: Week 6, San Francisco Dink-and-Dak:  14/24. 153 yards, 1 TD 3 INTs. QB Rating:  51.6 Brock Purdy:  17/24. 252 yards 4 TDs 0 INTs. QB Rating: 144.4 Same season record.  Same season stats, except for this one matchup.......Who's the MVP again?
How can Purdy all of sudden be MVP when you said that he’s no one without the talent around him Shannon?
Ill never forget the day UNC said Dak and Purdy are the 2 favorites for MVP right now! Ill remember this forever! 💯
SF 3 games in 14 days  PHI 3 games in 13 days   Most hyped game coming into the year. 49ers talking for 10 months. You’re at home. There’s 0 valid excuses. 49ers are better.
They had 2 QBs at the start of the NFC Championship game. It’s such a tired narrative that they had no QB. Should’ve blocked better.   Eagles had injuries yesterday too. Doesn’t matter. Should’ve played better. On to Dallas.
Stephen A is getting hard to watch
No one talking about the weekly disasterclass Brian Johnson conducts?
I think if these teams meet in the NFC championship it will be a much different game. Philly wasn’t looking at this game the same way San Fran was. They wanted retribution, and Philly was just playing a football game.
Bang bang niner gang
As a Dallas cowboy fan, I picked us to split with the Eagles regular season. but come playoffs, I want nothing to do with San Francisco, they are the most complete and dangerous team in the NFL, and they are bullies with a lot of swagger
Eagles & chiefs COULD LOSE OUT!!! And still meet w/Taylor swift & usher in the staged rigged Vegas heavyweight fight rematch+marriage proposal
Shannon and Stephen A. need to shut up about Purdy. Molly needs to shut up about Dak. She clearly wants to bang him. I would take Purdy over Dak starting the game with a 14 pt deficit. Same team, same players just Dak vs Purdy.
So, the 49ers can't complain about playing without a quarterback, but the Eagles can complain about having to play a team on 10 days rest? 😂
San fran should of been there and they proved that yesterday.Great points Stevie smith 👍👍👍
https://youtu.be/fcL_TPqITj4?si=woL2UQAElJQ6Qy06
The niners are thoroughly loaded
https://youtu.be/fcL_TPqITj4?si=woL2UQAElJQ6Qy06
I would've actually liked to see Shannon n Max debate😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'll at least give Shannon credit for laying aside his ego. Later today I guarantee we're going to see Nick Wright still miserable in denial.
Foot ball is a TEAM sport.
Chris Collinsworth for President
Purdy is MVP
Amazing how these guys ride bandwagons weekly.
My BALTIMORE RAVENS will defeat the 49ers on Christmas and Super Bowl!!
Swift got smashed worse than Taylor Swift on a Kansas City saturday night
If Brock Purdy played on the Bills and the Chiefs both teams would be 0-12. As long as Allen and Mahomes are playing in this league nobody will ever come close to being as valuable to their respective teams as they. Change the name of the award because it certainly doesn’t stand for most valuable player if we’re talking about Purdy and Dak Prescott.
Tyreek Hill is the MVP
I'm so glad they kept Dan lol.
y is she cutting himoff
They should’ve kept their OC and DC from last year. That’s what’s wrong with this team. They aren’t bad they’re still a great team they just aren’t in sync like they were last year.
Molly decided to be annoying again?
I think everyone was surprised they dominated Shannon I knew there Defense was nothing But i didn't think they would get smashed even though buffalo exposed there defense first.N Smith u made some good point about the Defensive coordinator.
Remember this when they play in playoffs 😂😂and I’m ravens fan everybody jump ship every week
💯
So we just go ignore CHRISTIAN MC CAFFERY & TYREEK HILL for MVP hun🤷🏿
Molly would you shut up
The Eagles team last year is better than our team this year. And we just got done playing these f****** insane games. They won, but that's not trying to take away. What happened last year? What our defense actually did to their team.
Stephen A   kills it and humiliates Orlovsky
Offense played bad for probably the first time this season now we not legit
Healthy, they win the nfc title easily.. eagles defense is not good against a great oline and it showed.. and eagles offense looked like nothing without the refs helping them or being able to tush push to get a first down every drive
THANK YOU SAS!!!!! for bringing this up!!!!
Eagles are frauds
Dak Prescott isn't in the MVP race because Purdy dominated Prescott, head-to-head They have the same stats, btu Purdy did it against better competition. The Cowboys have played among the easiest schedules in the NFL. The schedule now gets tougher for Dak.  Can he still put up big numbers?  Can he lead the Cowboys to a division title?  Show me against the Eagles, next week.
You guy's continue to believe these guys. Every week they're kissing another teams azz. First it was Philly, and now it's San Francisco.
Idk why Dan’s so shocked by this. Stephen A is right
Layne"False Start"Johnson for MVP
Stephan A a clown for trying to de-legitimize last season. It's over dude. Eagles were a much better team last season. Getting beat now has zero to do with the NFC championship.
Brock trailed all the first quarter 🤷🏾‍♂️
As a Niner fan, i just wana shout out to Lamar for MVP. Since hes already got one i think everyone is dismissing him. But, obviously, im fine with Brock winning it.
I hate to admit it but its #1 49rs  #2-A Eagles/#2-B Dallas #3 Lions  Who cares about the rest of em 😴 😅
This is who we are I’m not a delusional eagles fan I don’t see anything changing this late in the season I don’t see the eagles going far in the playoffs. We can’t run the ball like last year and our defense is atrocious
When the 9ers lost those three games everybody jumped off the wagon now everyone back on the wagon
How can u win MVP and had a 3 game losing streak. Yall are week 2 week with who yall root 4 n pick
DAN ORLOVSKY IS THE WORST Terrible qb and a worst analysis.....
The Eagles are missing Shane Steichen right now
Brock Purdy is the MVP
Go debate in a cave with your echo 😂
That was the worst defensive performance I’ve ever seen from this eagles team. They don’t deserve to go to the playoffs with that embarrassment in front of a national audience.
let's go NINERS !
thank you for the timestamps i can now skip orlovsky speaking with ease
The only thing with that was we were just better last year
This is Dan Moment lol
When in doubt, dan will pick the white qb
The Pigeons and their fan base who I like to call “The Birdbrains” got a heavy dose of reality of what a fluke their championship win was last season. Ah hahahaha!
The fact that Dak is in the same conversation as Brock is absolutely ridiculous!! Lets not forget the 49ers put 40+ on the cownoys and pulled their starters in the 3rd quarter...
Finished your sentences Mr Sharpe. Excuse me Brock Purdy what? I'll give it to CMc best Back in the game.
I agree with that take from X. Brock Purdy isn’t great. They just have the best TEAM in football. Purdy is just a part of the machine. Eagles are going to lose against the Cowboys. Cowboys are essentially coming off a bye. Eagles are best up and Cowboys play well against the Eagles especially at home
How is Dak MVP we watched their back up win 5 games last year! He has lost against good teams and he isn’t on the best team 😂😂😂The way the media glazes the Cowboys is sad.
Deebo is the actual MVP
Deebo was right‼️ Bang Bang Niner Gang‼️
Bro… that whole thing about the eagles not being rested….bro… the 49ers have played 3 games in 14 days…and the eagles have played 3 in 13…stop with the cap
3 games in 13 days...hardest schedule in the NFC for sure. Not making excuses, we got spanked at home. 10 wins and 2 losses...Eagles fans aren't worried about the Eagles 😂the narrative changes every week. Remember it's fluid 😴
Eagles will be ok.. it’s still 5 weeks left in the season. That’s a lot of football. 49ers got a great win. Hopefully we see these two teams play again at full strength in the playoffs. Eagles were missing a few players and played 3 games in 13 days while 49ers had 10 days rest. Which is a big deal in the NFL.  They play the cowboys on Sunday who has 10 days rest as well. I’m a Dolphins fan so I have no dog in this fight lol just stating the obvious 😅
Shannon had screamed Brock Purdy isn’t elite for weeks and weeks. Now he’s putting him as 1 of 2 players to win MVP this season… Sounds elite to me Unc
https://youtu.be/fcL_TPqITj4?si=cMeEL78LBZX43I05
Start focusing on how he gets the team the lead and then keeps the lead. Having to come from behind is something that does not happen every game.
Can we pump the brakes, PLEASE!!! Based on their schedule, they were due for a loss. If you keep playing good teams back to back....week to week, this was bound to happen. Jesus Christ!
I really like the chemistry of these 3.
Trent Williams should get MVP
Why they acting like the eagles is the same team last year, if this was the same team, the 49ers would had lost again,
Don’t forget the whole niners teams wore all black
Eagles will beat them next time they play 💯
None of brock purdy's passes was amazing, everything was yak.. so what is he doing thats so amazing he dumping 7 8 yard passes that the recievers are taking it the rest of the way. He isnt shaking off sacks scrammbling throwing dots.. he is literally throwing screens that go the distance hiw is that mvp level play san frans execution is mvp
Not the same eagles team- 5 new starters- two new coordinators… what a poor take
Cuz the birds lost, now Dallas is good because Niners beat them too. Smh is Dallas good or not..dumb takes.
Stephen A is so wrong. Eagles will be the one seed again and win the NFC. It’s the Niners fault they weren’t prepared
Of course Orlovsky is making excuses about philly being tired. Dallas play three games in twelve games as well. If philly gets beat down next week, the Talking Heads will say, “Dallas had ten days rest.”  And they wonder why ESPN’s rating continues to fall…
As an Eagles fan, this beat down is a wake up call moving forward for the team. Props to the 49ers. Eagles need to get their act together especially on defense. Don’t be surprised if they see each other again.
Shannon is riding the wagon now after all that sh....he was saying about my niners...
To Dans closing point i would like to add some nutrition , just a name and example being , Pat Maholmes . With Tyreek and good receivers he wins Sbs . Without , they lose to the Packers and Broncos . Stop the narrative . BROCK FOR MVP
Purdy had 314 yards 4 tds  He had 83 air yards and 231 yards after the catch.   On his 4 tds  he had 9 total air yards and 94 yards after the catch...
These takes are ridiculous, the Eagles have played 12 games and just lost their second game.  A couple of weeks ago these clowns were saying that maybe the 49ers should think about major changes to their roster and coaching staff.
They were down 6 nothing sounds like a deficit to me
Purdy is an average QB. Put any average QB on that 49'ers team they would be doing the same thing. Carr, Jordan love, Dobbs, fields, Mac Jones, etc. they would all be doing the same.
Poor Eagles Fans 😂😂😂FOCUS ON DALLAS THIS WEEK!!! or are you too fatigued from the competition yall been playing?? 😂😂👋🏾
It’s the Offensive Coordinator in Philly that’s the biggest problem. Doesn’t know how to call a run play on 1st down so everything is covered when teams rush 3 and guess pass. Brian Johnson has been the issue every game this season for the Eagles. He’s just an unqualified idiot
Look thier season was dallas and eagles this is the same team that dropped 3 games in a row.. thier offense was hurt not thier defense..
purdy is not exactly better than dak... but his skillset and poise fits so well with the 49ers, you could probably swap dak into the 49ers and they wont be as efficient as they are right now with purdy
If u actually watch football the eagles should of been lost there defense got exposed n with aj on offense they are nothin 💯🤷🏽‍♂️
Lol this narrative wasn't the same for the Eagles when they beat the Chiefs this season though.
Shannon jus reacting to win like most media people. Real late to the bandwagon. Try to Call it before it happens. Based on how Eagles been barely winning don't wait till they get smacked. This not even a take or any good analysis. They smack Eagle's so now they the best... I BET BY END OF PLAYOFFS  this will change. Use analysis not observationist
Molly’s voice is annoying, please fire her
Bang Bang Niners Gang let's go
Most than most of these weeks I looked at Philly and I always thought there was something off or wrong with them. Their defence is def a problem. But when the 49ers are healthy they’re the best team
Deebo was right!  The entire Team was right.  Stephen A is right.  The Eagles were de-legitimized by the NFC Champ last year cuz Brock Purdy got injured.  We know what happened when they played.
Cry eagles cry Thank god eagles, sirianni and those fans were humbled
That massive Lenoir hit on Swift towards the end of the game was the ultimate capper
Wow so now Shannon wants to give Brock Purdy his probs! Shameful the things he said about Brock Purdy the other week. "a product of his environment and not as talented as Jalen hurts"  Shannon Sharpe is a clown that knows nothing about football. He's n X pro idiot. He's old dead news compared to Brock Purdy
I love how molly interjects for no reason 😂😂
I thinking of putting a huge amount of money on the 49ers to win the Nfc championship title and the SUPERBOWL  this will stop them.
Good to have them all in person
Purdy is no MVP. Id rather give it to Deebo than Purdy. Purdy is making 5 yard passes and Deebo and Kittle are running for miles
The eagles have beat better teams only loss to 49ers and jets.
Man if eagles score in the redzone itll be a different game.. and u cant de ligitamize anything we got the banner and thier defense stunk it up.. and yall. Didnt uqve no qb cuz yall couldnt block our dline
Debo this my chain
I think Jordan Love can snag mvp if he keeps playing how hes playin hella underrated
Crazy that Eagles still have the best record in the league. Eagles are playing probably hardest schedule in the league . But no one ever gives the Eagles the benefit of the doubt. Jalen carter is still a rookie, Jordan Davis is still a 2nd yr player . But lets have this same energy in January. Eagles still have not played their best football .Same enerfy in January ..Please . This was their SB , Eagles will be in the real one.
The 49ers Have been the Best Team all year!! Keep the same energy yall had when we lost 3 in a row. NO weaknesses, CANT WAIT for the Playoffs 💪🏾💪🏾
Brock has the elite numbers that say he is MVP, he is on the best team in the NFL that helps his MVP argument and he has the narrative of being the ultimate underdog story of being picked as the last pick of the draft and overcoming that to put up insane numbers while winning against elite competition he is the league MVP!
Dan needs to stop he was talking mess about the niners and uplifting the eagles more. The nerve of him to say what if Brock floats into a deficit let’s not act like Dan hasn’t been doing that either
Stephen A is absolutely correct 💯
49ers and ravens gonna be a slug fest when they play
That stiffarm by jennings to get that td was the business
we’ll see how good they are christmas, nfc is dogwater this year, tell me im wrong
2 man race with purdy and Prescott but hurts has a better record then both 😂yea ok 👍
The 49ers are by far the best team in football. Against some of the best teams (Cowboys, Eagles, and Jags) they have brought their best performances showing a gap in both talent and coaching.
I’m shocked Hurts is considered for an MVP. The dude turns the ball over and over again, and he has a top 3 offensive line.
Eagles luck ran out. Should easily be 8-4 right now. Bailed by refs. And hurts is trash when he can’t tush push as shown yesterday.
LIONS AND NINERS NFC CHAMPIONSHIP, ITS A COLLISION COURSE AND NEITHER ONE IS FLINCHING! 😮💢❗️
VON MILLER vs DANA WHITE, WHO HIT THE HARDEST
Shannon he is not wrong 😂😂😂
If San Fran play the rest of their games the way they played yesterday, no one's stopping them.
49ers: Godzilla Eagles: Japan
We gonna see how “good” the niners are after my ravens beat them in there house !!!
Bang Bang !
The 49ers showed up in all black for the Eagles funeral pregame  Then stood on business for 4 quarters and routed the eagles at home
Just shown all eagles wins are refs when they dint cheat for them they lose
49ers going to the Superbowl.
When refs don’t cheat for eagles they lose
Just look at how Eagles players and coaches lose a game and point fingers directly at themselves, while crediting the opponent for playing a better game.  No, whining, and calling anyone out.
I don’t know why Eagles fans were surprised compared to the NFC championship. Niners literally ran out of QBs, of course this game would look way different
Fly eagles 🦅 fly has just been diverted
It’s about time the Eagles cakewalk of a path last year to the SuperBowl L is acknowledged! Daniel Jones and CMac at QB 😱 what competition! Hurts had 150yds both games and less than 25 patt, it was a joke, but In the end they were had 😊
of course, he aint wrong tho
Eagles luck ran out
