You explained this so well, thank you!
I would like all tasks to remain open for the duration of the Derby.  Have a habit of nodding off when playing late at night and so frustrating to wake up and be timed out.  Would also be nice to have a free farm pass offered as a bonus prize for hitting  milestones to reward loyalty
yes
A mí no me sale un QR para mí colección 😢
According to this video, if you place an item from your shop onto your farm, it will stay exactly where you place it, even if it is in the red zone. This is not happening . I have tried multiple times to place an item in the red zone on my farm and in the sanctuary space for it to produce the following error: "Not enough space." The item then goes back into storage.  This was a wonderful feature, please fix the bug so that it may be used.
Здравствуйте подскажите как получить подарок по кюаркоду?
Cómo se escanea el QR..:
Update the town n fishing it will be more fun
I haven't received the new Production building  ,please help
Night mood and different hours of the sun. Different clients as well would be cute, like the grass changing and the trees. Each season comes with different challenges
2:46 QR Code
3:17  What does "fallback reward" mean? How can it be a "reward" that you do NOT get puzzle pieces?   My wife has all the animals, so what happens to the "gray puzzle pieces"??   Will she get them later when new animals arrive?  Do they disappear?
To be able to search your townies! So for example searching ‘cinema’ will show everyone waiting instead of having to scroll through them all
Please more cows and chickens. And i would be great if we can also ask for help reducing the preparing time with everything
Gasoline in the valley is very insufficient
Hola tengo problemas con mis titulos de ampliación he recibido muchos y no me aparecen se desaparecen. Gracias por si pueden ayudarme.

Dear developers!👩🏻‍🌾Please add gooseberry bushes. In the bakery I would like to see various buns, for example: cinnamon rolls or croissants🥐 I would also like to see new recipes from Aissata, such as shepherd’s pie and mushroom pie👩🏽‍🍳 The zoo is already full of a variety of animals, but the main king of animals is there is no lion. Please add it!🦁I will be very glad and grateful to see in the game!🥰
Why multiple truck orders has stopped????

In the city I would like to see the expansion of the beach section, the piece opposite the zoo, please enlarge it.🏖️ Regarding the dairy plant, add more cells, a lot of products with milk. On your Supercell ID account, make the number of friends visible. I will be very happy and grateful to see this in the game!😍🔥

Hay day can you make it so u can sell decorations plss
No me salio la recompensa 😢
Hello I find some of the things on the farms are too expensive and to get one diamond it's very hard you have to work so hard to get a diamond I find you people should give people sores and acts to cut down the line when they are now playing the game as a start I love the game I'll make it easy for those who change phones can go back and get back the game that they will play before instead of you have to create a new game and go through a whole process
الله يطيح حظكم ع مود 10 ماسات تردوني اصرف 55 ماسة
Hay day, como faço pra desativar o modo fotografia. Instalei sem querer

The ability to buy and sell decorations would be a nice option.
How do you earn the ghost pig decoration? What is a community inbox milestone event? I wish there was a tutorial video in the collection book explaining where to find special decorations, if they are not in the diamond/ coin shop or gift catalog.
Why don’t I have the inbox on my game anymore
😍😍😍😍
🎉
They need to cut the time to like 20 minutes on all the appliance it takes to long when it’s 2 hours then you lose rewards because it takes too long for the stuff to cook or be made please fix it I love playing this game I play it every day
I agree we need night time play also please

Il primo non è venuto perché la con la vinilica non ha mai funzionato per fare lo slime, te lo dice una che è stata tre anni a farlo durante la sua era delle medie e avevo un armadio pieno di barattolini solo di quello. E li vendevo anche HAHAGAHAHA
Thank you for your service of the game. I've been playing Hay Day for more than several years. Please add section setting mode so players can move section while decorating their farm. It is a little frustrating when I have to move the whole small decorates or buildings only a tile.
Introduce the night mode😭😭😭😭
How do I scan the barcode to get the decoration?
Buen día una pregunta donde se consigue el código del creador para apoyar gracias

Scanned the code five times. Says I got it, but I didn't.
I randomly came here to check on hay day after I deleted a few years ago cause I missed it and I’m so glad I did🤗 these new video updates won me back I’m addicted
The badger of my farm was wiped away as the morning came
I don’t know if I am the only one but every time is the farmers market that they will buy decorations I get so excited because I have a bunch of decorations that i don’t even use and I have never get an offer for anything at this point I don’t even believe they do buy any decorations

Trading post or ability to barter with other players where they we can make offers to trade decorations or sell them for gold. ❤

We need night mode please 😢😢😢😢
Having issues with completing tasks for other farms. Clicking on it to fill the order is not successful ☹️
Greg, please. Help us many hay day farmers, with the decorations, like the creepy organist (pianist) and the mausoleum, the decorations we want to have them!!! but please keep in mind that for the north american countries and others that pay in dollars is much easier to acquire them paying in dollars....  but in south american countries like us in as colombia where we are many (all my family group we have there day) we are not given the opportunity to buy them with real money, it is not easy for the economy for the country to pay for the decoration unless it is with diamonds or game currency, the idea is that we all have the opportunity to have those nice decorations, give us the opportunity to have the spooky organist (pianist) please or place them in the 🎁 gift chests that you put in your greg farm (in the greg calendar). .PLEASE I AM THE VOICE OF MANY FARMERS.
I would love to be able to sell decorations as I have multiple and will not use them and I would like to be able to remove something that is set up to make if you accidentally add too many
Takes me ages to get puzzles for my jungle
Happy Halloween 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃👻👻👻🎃

Belle decorazioni, ma non so come inviare screening schot
How do I get the free Pig Ghost?👻
نفس اللي دايم حاولوا تجددون في الافكار 😃
Hi, I have an improvement that I would really like to see in the game. I think we should be able to sell decorations just like we can sell and buy products from other players in the newspaper. I have so many decorations in stock that I don’t want and I don’t like putting decorations because they take up space in the farm and they are useless (they don’t do anything). So I wish we could sell decorations to other players, so we can get rid of the decorations we don’t want and get coins. That would be really appreciated in a future update. Thank you.
How do you clame the deco with the qr code?
We would like to Be able to actually go inside the gold mine and pick where we want to dig. That would be a cool addition.
Night mode would be amazing!
We need more space in the town, please!
Can you please say Where i can found gregs calendar becose there was  spooky decoration item but i actually don’t understand think about greg calender
Halloween content is the best content
remove daily limit for expansion & upgrade  materials
Make puzzle pieces easier to obtain
Love, love, love the game. You do a great job. I do have one question, tho. Why does Tom need to run off after you tell him what you want. Couldn’t we tell him what we want AND how many at the same time? Seems like it would be more efficient. Just a suggestion. 😀🩷
❤❤
Necesito traductor 😢
O Halloween ficou muito top ficou muito incrível A Fazenda❤❤😊😊
Il gioco e' bellissimo purtroppo non si ha la possibilità di espansioni i terreni sono troppi e c e' carenza di carte, purtroppo non si può spendere sempre 14,00 euro troppo caro sono delusa
It would be great if we dont get the same prizes we already have. These diamonds needed to get things . That’s for your money not us. I bought 3x diamonds for getting from store i got the same things
Que raro no hay árbol de aguacate

Ya estoy harta de los adornos... algo nuevo de granja!!!!

I’d love for them to update the material limit so I can upgrade my barn and silo more regularly because it’s getting annoying only being able to buy 80 items every 24 hours at least lower the time limit I beg you guys.
The sanctuary needs more space!
The game is glitching after this last update, pls fix it asap

1. Night mode. 2. Different weather mode ( to be set up by players with multiple choices over multiple areas). 3. Tom's hiring time to be put on pause/ sleep mode by players ( you know in between playing sessions we do  sleep, work, study,  sometimes even do take vacations). 4. Decorations & tools available for sale. 5. Cancel button on all actions (maybe with time limit) with items returning to players' inventory. 6. Expansion items/ decorations upgrade items available to be bought within game shops not store (they're ridiculously expensive). 7. Selection of special events to be chosen by players to be set up on their farms where players would chose the tickets for other players ( in game money or items as price for participation) and the winning prize from their inventory. 8. Daily, weekly, monthly gifts to be sent to other players (items from inventory including decorations). 9. Special prizes for players based on their time spent playing game.
Es wär schön ,wenn man mal einen Nachtmodus in Hay Day hätte ....zumindestens jetzt in der Winterzeit ,wenn alles leutet im Dunkeln sieht bestimmt super aus ....👍🏻👍🏻🤗
MAKE A DOUBLE TAP ON THE DIAMONDS!!!

After this last update, the game is showing instability and bugs and the device is overheating. What is happening?
I don't have enough resources for Halloween🎃👻🍬 decorations... And i haven't buy any royal paas. Feeling bad 😢
Çok güzel bir oyun
I think u must add night theme in halloween event .
I hate it when updates put stupid hats/clothes on farm animals.  First thing I do is click in animals and remove them.  I also wish we could just sell decorations we don’t want instead of waiting for it to be a special feature when serving fam visitors. I use some decorations on my farms but have loads that I am never going to use.
It says scan the qr code to claim the deco but how to scan it?
How to claim the deco from qr code?
Pls create a night mode
Hi love the game. However your catalog needs more décorations also the pass is way to short. I have completed all quest and have 22 days to wait to play more. I need a way to get more chicken tickets. It's rather annoying to have animals you want to get but can't because of these chicken tickets. Please extend the length of the farm pass chicken quest. I'm done and have to wait way to long to play it again.

Lütfen oyun içinde ödül olarak kazandığımız güçlendirici kartları elmasla depolama olayını iyileştirin kaldırın. Çok can sıkıcı.!! Neden kazandığımız kartları bir başka kartla değiştirerek veya silerek atmak zorunda bırakılıyoruz hiç anlamıyorum.!! Hayday da daha düzeltilmesi gereken çok şey var..
incomprensibile. Improve your english please.
PLEASE HELP!!?!   I downloaded the update a day or 2 ago and There isn't the usual Hay Day Halloween Greeting when logging in on opening screen! No is there the usual fog on my farm nor the jack o lanterns on my pumpkin crops or my animals dressed in costumes!!?!!! What was the update for?  Do we update again?  Usually when we update Hay Day offers us some diamond rewards! Tho, they don't need to reward me for me to update, but that does usually tell me that it has worked!! When Does the Real Halloween Update happen!?  I'm so Confused!! Please help anyone who knows the Answers!?!! THANK YOU!  Blessings!

It won’t let me get qr code
I'd like it easier to buy items needed, like axes. I need at least 100 to cut down white nectar bushes.

please prepare a situation to get the missed decoration. i had exams and i didn't play for monthes and i missed olympic decoration. i really wants to have the but can't. second the decoration of building,shop and car that we buy for the first time it should be free if we want to use it later. although i have 75% off but it's not enough
Where is the Halloween treat maker?
very good but we need two more updades. first the night mood. it's really essential. i play at night in the dark room and the light of the game bothers me a lot. second select the booster to use while i have extra booster that i should trash or switch them.
having a refund option from the things you buy would be a great idea, you receive your money/ gems back depending on how long you’ve had the thing
Halloween treat maker where oh where can I find that ???
Я так чекала на чорні троянди, і що((((  1 троянди через 14 днів((((😠😠😠 Ви знущаєтеся?!

Gostei mais queria que ficasse mais fácil conseguir os animais e os terrenos(ex macacos seria interessante)
I hope to add night mode to the game as an option for players
My halloween event catalog  task has disappeared with the new update, really. So I can't play to collect my hats.
Wow❤❤❤❤❤ love it
Does anybody from Hay Day actually play this game daily where you don’t buy anything? What’s the use of giving us pieces of fences where we can’t use anywhere because we only have one or two poles.
I still haven't seen the lab with the bats flying around it come to the game this month yet. Did I miss it?
Why do we need blue swaters to make sekelton candy that doesn’t make sense!!!!!!!!!
I do not want to play my game at night in a night mode game where I can’t see anything.
❤
Thank you .Obrigada
Amei
Halloween is demonic. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that everyone who is playing this game during halloween Will not be influenced. God open the eyes of the gamemakers. Lord that they Will glorify you trough this game and not satan. In Jesus name I pray. Amen
Tropa dos Brasileiros ❤

Omg thank you for improving the decoration brush, the shop shifting back cost me so much time of my life

Mode night pliss
Fell asleep and forgot to buy the Halloween decorations is there any way to get the ones I’m missing now? The fence and the gravestone and something else 😩😢
Si ce sont des belus, on est mal barrés. Vu les questions sur votre site, où je ne vais plus parce que je 😭 avec des questions dé bi. .es, il y en a un paquet
Where is the Halloween machine maker?  Do only certain players receive one?  Just asking.

Please update movement animation of animal more realistic, thank you
Since the new update the lobster pool as soon some bugs. I can’t put two lobsters in it anymore
Seria possível, acrescentar ao conjunto de flores a tulipa e a rosa? E nas frutíferas o mamieito, o abacateiro e o caquiseiro? E que no laticínio produza o dobro de cada produto? Gostaria que acrescentasse tbm o picole de abacaxi 😁!
How do I get the reward from this video if I only play on my phone?
I’m confused, the potion area was not available in the catalog the first week for me
Allowing us to rotate while in the red zone would be a HUGGGE help!!!❤ I’m so excited for all the new decos!!
Depois do update de hoje não consigo mais abrir o jogo
Wood chipper instead of saws and axes. An item to buy at level 100. Buy it with coins! I’ve been wanting this for YEARS 👩🏻‍🌾
I love the update when it comes to decorating!!!! When you lay out a new decoration, it won’t send you back to the top of your decor list!!! Thank you all!
I don't  see any of the new decorations after the update
Thanks ❤❤❤❤
How to get decoration through the barcode
Pls give us like a lasso tool for edit mode so we can lasso areas and then move the entire decoration setup inside at once so you dont need to move every single item when you just want it in a different place
ممكن تسريع الزرع بعمليه هطول امطار
Please fix the issue asap in india😵😵
Why can't i open my farm !!! This update sucks..
Would be amazing to be able to send gifs for our friends, either a daily random item or decorations we have stored
X favor esta no es mi granja pues yo voy en el nivel 149 como hago para recuperar la? Gracias😢
No spooky Halloween music this year?? 😢
Separate storage for building supplies. Please and thank you.
Fences- when we get a new fence piece it’s usually just one piece!  Why can’t you open it up in the store , once we get that one piece, so we can buy more pieces with our coins -not diamonds- so we can add onto our new fence?   And we can’t connect different one fence pieces, that wouldn’t look nice even if that feature worked.   I have so many just one piece, same with path pieces, just one.
Nooo just missed out on the Halloween event why can’t you run it over Halloween 😢😢😢
Truck not working 😢
Did any of you see and get on the catalog  the first decoration they showed in the video for the week 1 ? I did not find it yet
更新了，但是卡车也不能同时送两单啊😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I love the sanctuary...why not add polar bears for the ice berg area!?
Where's the QR code !!!!!!!!!
That was a very weak update, now my friend helps aren’t working properly and it’s much more difficult to switch accounts.   My last helper tab is still not working properly.   Net net loss with the update.
a good update would be to be able to use the wood from the trees that are cut!
Ameiii❤😊
Siempre que hay una nueva actualización cuesta mucho entrar a las granjas.
We are now well into October and I just updated the game this morning. When will the birds turn into bats and the glowing pumpkins appear in the trees on the farm? It was so much more enjoyable when these items were here for the full month instead of just a couple of weeks at the end of the month. There are those of us who enjoy decorating for the holidays and the pumpkins and bats just added to the fun. 🎃🦇🎃
Tolong aku bagaimana cara mengubah umur😭
Quiero denunciar que hace mucho tiempo que no me sale la entrada de cine, reclamé muchas veces y me arreglan el problema,no juego en las mismas condiciones que los demás, estoy muy enfadada
Huyy
Berbat.
We need nightmood ❤❤
Why are there no more movies to watch on my hayday? I also can't watch videos to speed up my production machine? Even though I have updated it😢😢😢
Супер 👍 👍 👍 👍 ❤
Pretty boring update imo. We don't need anymore sanctuary animals. It would be nice if Hay day would release an update full of some things that the players have been asking for for years. It seems like they never listen to the people that actually play their game and spend money.
Hindi language please game me
I finished my game I got my decoration Then I found out my book is not complete why hayday
My dream night mode 😍
I participated in the spider task and the tasks I got did not provide enough points to complete up to 12500 and after I added tasks I still did not get past 11000. I would like if they add more tasks to the daily task total. Aan they must make sure that your farm will be able to complete the task. Can't have a cupcake task but you do not have a cupcake machine.  I also think they mast add more options for land expansion as a reward as it takes forever to unlock land.   More weather conditions will be nice. And a dark mode will be very fitting for Halloween and adding some ghost s will also be fun.
NIGHT MODEEEEE
Why didn't my Halloween candy bar arrive even though the game was updated?
Hayday is so greedy now . Always asking for real money for the decor 😡
我喜歡農場更希望看到佷多隻狐狸在農埸內…謝々
😡😡😡😡😡😡
The update didnt work🩷
Hayday ekibi birde mevcut olan evin yerinide ve  yoluda istediğimiz gibi koysak guzel olurdu evimizi 8stedigjmiz yere koyalım bunu bnce yapın çok güzel olur
Cadılar  bayramı etkinliğinde tabloda birinci sıraya iki kere ciktim ama oyun bna sadece 25 sıradaki ödülleri verdi üstelik tamamladım halde.bu haksızlık.

How can I scan the barcode to get the tree 😢
Mancano 22 ore per poter ritirare i premi dell'evento ma non è possibile fare altri incarichi perché l'evento risulta terminato.....non ha senso
Aamooooozzinggggg 😍😍😍😍😍😍
2:46 for decoration qr code
Can you let us sell our decorations at the Roadside Shop?
Eu acho que essas tarefas de produção de produtos pra ganhar recompensas que podem ser trocados por produtos do catálogo é muito injusta. Terminei todas as tarefas e não quando fui ver, fiquei mais de mil pontos atrás do primeiro colocado. É injusto algumas fazendas ganharem tarefas que pagam mais e outras menos pontos! Não perdi nenhuma tarefa, fiz todas. Vocês podem me explicar por quê acontece isso?!?🙄😒 É simplesmente frustrante!
PLEASE GIVE AN EXTENSION ON EVENT 😊😊😊😢😢😢😢
Why doesn’t the QR code work
What’s going on with the Halloween event? Today is the last day, the game is not letting me finish the event.  The game shortened me with task to finish.  This is sucks!  This is the second time it happened. Why? You wasted my time.
Ok😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
O evento precisa de mais horas.
Quando vai liberar a atualização pra comprar itens de Halloween?
Günlük ücretsiz hediyelerde reklam filmleri aşırı uzun ayrıca izlerken bağlantı sürekli kesiliyor ki modemin yanındayım bu normal değil.
Decoration QR code at 2:45
Who has all the sanctuary animal puzzle pieces?? That’s impressive 😅
I wanted to buy more snails with gold shield. But now their gone - is this all just a scam? Thing we could buy before are now unable to get! 🤯🤦🏼‍♂️
Its the first dairy news i ever saw... and the first i thought is that lavinia sounds like agnes from the minecraft live events xD
LET US SELL DECORATIONS...please?❤
தமிழ் தெரிந்தவர்கள் உள்ளீர்களா
You are doing something mean! You are selling beautiful jewelry for cash! 👎👎👎
The decoration quality has gone down a ton.

ЗДРАСТВУЙТЕ Я СКАЖУ ВАМ  МНЕ ЗАДАНАТИЛИ НА ФАРМ ПАСС АНО НЕ КУПИЛОСЬ ЭТО БАГ?
It would be nice of the skins update wasn't so expensive if you already have them. Why so expensive to change, I could understand if it was a new skin you are trying to purchase for the truck, stall, or house!!
Sheep and goats sounds are inverted, it' so annoying to hear goats while I am near to sheep and viceversa.  And actual sheep have teeth only on the lower jaw. I know it's a game but farmers are farmers even in a game 😂
Why do we new crop types when we level up with no soil to plant them in?! Please give us more soil Hayday!
Yo solo quiero un buscador en el periódico 😢
Still waiting on llamas 🦙 🙏😉
Please i need the basement
Please make the reward program like 1 day longer lime this if u agree
It will be great, playing with the hay day pass we pay for, to be able to have a share of diamonds!  Especially when you are alone in the neighborhood. In the state it’s so frustrating ! it would be interesting to have boosts for all machines and not just some of them.
I am not getting the hats from making products to receive them. I am only receiving them by getting to the reward bar. Therefore I cannot get items from the book. Please help!
اريد ترجعون الثغره
Wäre toll wenn man auch was von seinen Dekosachen verkaufen könnte. Ist fast alles doppelt so viel braucht kein Mensch bitte.
Please get night mode!!!!! It would be so nice when playing on the evening. I don’t even understand how it’s not already in the game?????? And why can’t we get time limited decorations for different seasons like halloween and Christmas that we can buy at the shop with hayday money or dimonds?? It sucks that we only get like one fence from the catalog and can’t buy more?? Like how are we going to use one fence?????? I don’t understand.
We NEED a night mode. 😭😭
I want a million diamonds and a 100 thousands coins please

Dev, pls fix your task event. I always got task that i dont have such as sanctuary or animal sanctuary. I dont want to spend my money to something that i dont have yet. I like doing task event but it comes with impossible task. Pls use AI generator for task event. Thanks.
Night mode please 🌌
I wish we could design our own profile avatar pics or use our own personal pictures. The selection is very limited.
QR Code cannot scan
Can you make 3D simulator to view our Garden design?
We demand the introduction of night mode with lights that can be turned on and off.❤❤
Thanks have been playing since day 1
Having certain things that light up only and make it twilight dark . House, lamps truck boat lighthouse, or be completely dark (test your night skills. Cool ideas👍♥️
And have an option to purchase additional fencing that you only give us 1 or 2 or so we can actually use them. I have ONE piece of multicolor/rainbow fence that is absolutely useless
Adding a dark mode option with moonlight or different noise background. I have my noise turned off but would like to have another option so it’s not silence while I play.
Buenicimo , !!
I wish I could exchange Secret Coffin for Baby chicks pool and Spider Web path for Autumn Leaf path. Could be really nice option exchange decorations which I don't like for decorations which I likes a lot. (Maybe exchange could be reward for watching advertising?)
Was man wirklich braucht ist eine zweite Molkerei!!!!!!!

Donde está el KR para el Árbol? No engañéis por favor
Hats point wasn't calculated after task completed, pls check . There is bug
En este juego es casi imposible jugar ante un montón de enfermos que están a cargo de esta mierda y más encima ladrones, hacen actualizaciones inventan un cantidad de mierda para jugar con nosotros y nos dan tareas que duran horas y que no se alcanzan hacer y más en la misma máquina y para que den unos malditos puntos que jamás se podrá lograr todo sus famosos premios y digan que no es verdad y juegan con nuestro tiempo y creen que uno no tiene vida que tiene que estar metida en esto hay gente que trabajamos, que tenemos familia, otros hijos y obvio vida como para que piensen que nos pasaremos días enteros acá y muchos parte de la noche... Que ridículos!!!
Je tadore mon jeu formidable❤❤❤❤hay day😊
i just wanna know where is the QR i should scan
منو قوي في اللعبه محتاج مساعده ارجوكم😢
Hey hayday, i love the exciting new updates genuinely sooo excited for fall… but is there a way we could get a way to cancel products in cue if placed by accident so i wouldn’t have to waste farm resources 😭 just a suggestion 😅love the game btw keep up the good work🩷
How can I claim this decoration?
My suggestions: 1. decoration trading with neighborhood. 2. When a neighbor needs help with the “!” Symbol maybe it should change to the symbol is needs help with like a truck symbol, boat, tree,bush, town etc. easier to find and 3. A Night mode would be so cool. ❤

Reduce all machine produce time and make all slots are running same time its help for production make in less time.
Please stop asking for night mode. That sucks when it is tied to your time. I play mostly at night.
Hey, why do I only get a few profit points? Even though I have completed all the tasks, it is not comparable to the points I get!!!!
So bad👎👎👎
For the love of the sanctuary animals: get us another feed maker and for the environment: a useful machine for the harvested wood.
Changing weather mode
Please add Night mode
A quand la création d’une nouvelle machine??  Je tourne en rond dans HAY DAY avec toutes les machines..  ça fait 7/8 ans que je suis sur ce jeux et j’ai l’impression de tourner en rond lorsqu’il n’y a pas de nouvelles machines ou récoltes????
QR kodu nerede???
Sigo insistiendo con los permisos de ampliación.. on demasiado escasos y siempre salen al final de los eventos y no es justo que no  se puedan obtener por que piden productos de las máquinas que no tenemos..😢
Thank you 🫶🏻
HAYDAY NIGHT MODEE PULEASEEE 😫🙏🏼

I would like to stop getting town upgrade stuff once you have already upgraded everything

Je ne trouve pas le QR code d'halloween !!!
I can’t figure out how to scan the QR Code. It says at the end of dairy news, but it’s not showing me where the QR code is and I can’t scan it for the tree so I can get my 10 diamonds. Also, make Earnest work faster in the dairy.

Why isn’t the potion stand with the bats flying around it not on the first week of the catalog? You said “in the first week of the catalog will feature classic Halloween decorations that we may have missed”  while showing that decor. So I was thinking it would of been there this week

I can still not get the Trick Tree that you advertise that I can get with scanning a QR code.  As I stated previously I do not know how to do that.  If it is free please send it to me.  Thank you for the free witches hat.  Thank you.

Было бы лучше если снимите лимит на строй материал или делай так , чтоб на амбар , башню, земли отдельно существовал лимит из-за лимита очень тупо идет расширение

There should be NIGHT MODE.. To make it more realistic... Really! Love it if it's happen... 🙏👍
Gostaria que fosse possível entrar nas máquinas de produção e coletar só o inten que fosse desejado, quando fazemos muitas produção.
I feel nowadays that hay day had become overwhelming actually  😵‍💫 but i guess who gets bored easily will like it more
Alles schön und gut aber wie oder wo bekommt man diese Hexenhüte ?? Wäre mal schön wenn man hier auch mal eine Antwort bekommt. Immer wird gesagt schreibt es mir in die Kommentare, aber antworten gibt's dann keine. Aber immer betteln das man doch linken, klicken, und abonnieren soll.
Night mode update please
Give us pandas in the sanctuary 🫶🏽

I would like to trade decorations with neighbors.
This would be a great update, but I would like to add a cool new feature to it that would make the gameplay easier and stand out from the rest of the time-wasters. The feature would be a small shop next to the side shop that would sell coupons or home decor, trucks, and shops. 👨‍🌾🏬
I don’t understand how the clock runs on the hat collecting, but you can not earn more. I thought the machine was supposed to be out the second day? Very disappointing.
AMO ESTE JUEGO, DEBERÍAN FACILITAR MÁS  LA OBTENCIÓN DE TOM SON MUCHOS DIAMANTES
Night Mode and Lanterns would be cool

Potreste dare la possibilità dì leggere in italiano
Please add a town visitor request board to the main farm of people we visit! Don’t like having to wait for their town to load only to find out I can’t fill their help request anyway…
When giving soil materials, you should also give permission, that is what is really needed.
I can't see my list friends when I enter the game, my game crashes, I close and open it, it takes a long time, what should I do? thanks
كيف نقون بمسح QR
Were can we find the qr code to complete our collection?
Perfeito,a atualização está incrível!! ❤❤❤
Bana güncelleme gelmedi ve geçici makina da gelmedi. Nedenini  bilen var mı?
How about let decide the player where to put the puzzle piece when they get it?  It is do frustrating to have animals missing just 1 or 2 and have a bunch of others just started.  Also let's do something with the voucher. Can we trade them in for actual useful goods? I've at least more than 1000 green ones and don't really know what to do with them. They are such a waste
I want to give away or sell the decorations I don’t use
I don't see QR code when i watch video
Who else has noticed that when you are almost to building up your barn or silo and you only need like say a plank but you don't get it and go to your farm the next day and get that last plank so you go to build your barn up and lo and behold somehow you're now missing 3 planks ? How about when you're almost done with a special catalog task? Only need one loaf of bread out of 8 and it's almost finished, when it's done you collect it yet your count remains at 7? I'm having these issues and I'm sure others have too. Yet you go to let them know and they want screenshots for proof? How many farmers here are taking a screenshot of every single thing they do on their farm? I'm only trying to let them know they have a glitch. What's going to happen when you're sending your hard earned money for extras and this glitch screws you out of your purchase? If you don't have a screenshot you have no proof so you can go get bent I guess.
but i am very much disappointed because of there is lack of halloween music...i just loved it ....again there is no decor in the gregs farm as well...i just waited whole year for this halloween purpose but it not giving the vibe of halloween as it was before
How & where to scan the code
Como faço pra ler esse Qrcode?
Why when your time runs out on a task, the system says you failed two of the same thing? Might wanna look at your code.
sekarang saya berminat lagi bermain hayday karena sudah inovasi dalam berbagai acara dan pemberian hadiah,,,setelah setahun saya boring karena dulu tak pernah update acara apalagi hadiah2 sangat sulit didapat... terus beri apresiasi pemain lama dengan acara2 dan hadiah2 berikutnya
We need to be able to put decorations for sale! I'm over flowing  with ones I won't use
For the Qr code, there's a link in the description(the first link) and you can claim the deco that way, it worked for me...
How come the boat isn't giving puzzle pieces? Last event i couldn't purchase them either
How do we scan the QR code?
I am playing the basket game and I am not getting my rewards.  I completed one day and have almost completed the 2nd day and I still only show 154 points. Please check this and give me my points
Where is the QR code
I wish this game was a little more time forgiving. I work full time and love this game but it’s hard to stay consistent without the need to spend diamonds (money) in order to finish everything in a timely manner. I understand that decorations AREN’T necessarily important but it is a huge part of the experience of the game and they know this.
What happened to buying decorations in the shop I miss that now we have to use real money to get certain decorations? I do like these events to earn the decorations that's cool but not being to use diamonds or coins to buy other types is disappointing u don't understand how the shop works it doesn't show any of the decorations like before
Where are the QR for the decorations?
Même en mettre sous titrage en français rien ne s'affiche 😢 je ne comprends rien à vos vidéos
WE WANT DIWALI DECOR NEXT!!!! FIRECRACKER, DIYAS, RANGOLI IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE, MARIGOLD FLOWER DECORATION ❤❤❤❤
I do not know how to get the Trick Tree.  I do not know how to scan a QR code as the game tells me to.  I watched the YouTube video completely.  I would like to get it, but if it is free then why not just upload it into our games.  Send it to me if you can if not well okay.
تحتاج اللعبة إلى تحديثات كثيرة
Where is the QR?
I want to scan but from where?
We have so many machines, decorations and other stuff, like asparagus? Essence oil machine or something? but I'm still waiting for basic blueberries.

Where is the QR to get a tree in the magazine ??
I've completed some tasks from the halloween event but even after claiming it I didn't get the halloween hat. This happened to me twice today. Not sure if it's a bug or some kind of limitations to grab the hats in a day... Any idea... Pls let me know I've been playing this game since 3 yrs, faced this issue this time only...😢
Como faço pra adquirir a decoração, ja assisti várias vezes, e não vi como acessar o QR code

2:46 how do we scan the QR code
You guys ate with this one 😍😍
Puzzle pieces, in catalogue says I’ve reached my limit, can’t get puzzle pieces, everything says that. I have all animals, new one coming, why can’t I get them ?on all themes we’ve played my puzzle pieces seem to fly away.  This is not right, I’m being cheated on these, sure I’m not the only one. Can you please fix this ? I’ve been playing 6-7 years !

Hay day is becoming boring. Everything cost diamonds. I understand they need to make money but they only care about making money.  I’m starting to hate this game. Can’t even find the Halloween deco in my shop. Cause there is no shop anymore it’s just stored stuff. Hay day is going down hill.  😢
Add coral reefs Like so hayday sees this
Not sure why this video is highlighting decorations available in the catalog that is not in our catalogs.

How do I get Halloween pieces?
you guys did a whole long frustraiting survey trying to figure out what we would be willing to pay real money for.... customizing the backdrop of our farm is what people would pay for. you made a joke years ago about night mode and thats something i would probably pay $15 USD for at least. instead you just add.... hats for animals? no thanks?
Has anyone tips for scanning the qr code? I ve attempted it 4 times
That’s why I love hay day, they always add new animals when they update and it’s kinda like real life❤❤❤ so I love you so much

Everything is very beautiful but the times are always too long . You still have to solve the problem of recovering the farms
where is the qr?
Im loving the new improvements but could you make it a little easier to collect puzzle pieces? In boat orders for me it 1/4 (if i dont skip them) not including farm pass, events or even the shop.

С каждым днём игра становится всё не интересней и не интересней.
Was anyone able to claim the QR code prize? Mine wouldn't work.
How can I get the free deco per QR code? Last time it was in the comments to automatically get it........😮
Can't claim scan decorations because I play on my phone. Thanks for all the info and artwork you all do.
Where is the QR code?
Night mode would be nice, but I also hope you soon have fallback prizes not only for puzzle pieces (finally, but only after you introduce the ostrich chicks) but also for chick vouchers: you only allow us to have 25 chick vouchers maximum, and as you haven't introduced any new birds recently, we're very close to hitting that 25 maximum.  With so many events requiring you to collect X number of items produced in one production unit, it would be nice if you could pause pickups from a production unit. E.g., have a "pause" button, which, when you hit it, means you don't collect items from that unit, instead, you simply can add more items to the queue. Right now, its essentially necessary to ensure that for the entire duration of the events that your barn is 100% full so that you never accidentally pick up an item that you're producing for one of the goals. You could restrict this pause to only to apply to five units at any one time.

Take my money 💵 🤣
I would love for the town people and animals to be able to interact with like chairs and decor things. I think it would be so cool!! Also more types of dogs/cats/horses !
Night mode will be the best update yet!
Muito legal ter novas atualizações 🥳
Como consigo a recompensa?

Need night mode

How about a scooter for Tom or his own shop.  And producing more bolts and having an ice box for the fish added to the house and a feather bin. And a making the bee hive box a real to hold the honey. And the expansion tools being held in a tool shed. So we can have room in our barn
Ayuda como puedo descargar mi adorno de este video
Thank you! I love it all, may I suggest Halloween themed Gnomes, pls & tyvm! 🎃👻
Lots of good suggestions in the comments. Too bad you never read them. Honestly I couldn't care less about collecting decorations. And I am not spending an hour looking for what needs help on farms who are wall to wall decorations. If your farm is cluttered, I probably won't be helping you.
Thank you!

Can Tom be made to sleep when we do? I pay for Tom for 24 hours or 3 days and when I sleep I lose all those hours. Such a waste. Please please consider 👍😀

Also, we should be able to see what items are in queue (using a double tap like we do with everything else) without having to accept the item first once it is made.   Next, getting puzzle pieces for the town animals takes too long.    There are a lot of great ideas being made in these comments. I truly hope they are read by the creators of the game.
كيف نأخذ سكان على الباركود وأين يوجد الباركود
I recommend letting multiple people help you with requests.  Like if I need to fill a townie order for 15 syrups then multiple people should be able to fill the order and give what they can instead of all 15.       Also, we need to have another storage way to hold expansion materials. Trying to hold an abundance of one item while waiting to fill the other items necessary to expand/upgrade takes up a lot of space in the barn.
Perdonen la pregunta, donde consigo el QR
I can't even claim decorations because of the stupid words at the bottom
Comment récupérer la déco de l’arbre aux rubans  ?  Je ne sais même pas comment flasher le QR Code 😢 . Pourquoi ce n’est pas proposé au magasin  ???
It should be a night mode, players should be able to choose day or night whenever they want. This is what has been asked of you for years, but you don't even give an answer. Even if it's negative
Please exchange this task event for the county fair! Besides the fair event being cooler, I never complete all the event tasks! Please add more county fair next time! Thanks😊

Tengo todos los pajaritos y animales y en el pase de la graja uno de los premios es tiques para conseguirlos todo un desastre no tienen en cuenta a las granjas que ya los tenemos todos
Hediyeler için çok fazla elmas isteniyor,elmaslara kolay erişilimiyor. Yağmur ve gece moodu temaları gelirse daha iyi olur ve makineler çok pahalı. Bir şeylerin üretim süresi çok uzun,lütfen bu oyunu oynayan kişilerin isteklerine kulak verin ve çözüm sunun.

Me gustaba antes Hay Day cuando podias comprar con monedas algunos articulos de decoración, cada temporada sacaban articulos nuevos dependiendo las fechas, ahora ya no dejan nada en la tienda, ahora todos los articulos de temporada tienes que forzosamente comprarlos con diamantes o con dinero 😪

Hayday is getting greedy and boring.   Unless you pay up farm pass you get some old recycled decorations. Not bothering any more
Most players DO NOT want all of the sanctuary animals! It would be great if we could choose the ones we want and not have to get them all 😊 Please consider this for future update.
QR code  2:47
Where is the QR code?
suggestions I would make With the sanctuary animals please finish a page 1st puzzle pieces before you start a new page. I have like five pages of animals with like one or two pieces. and maybe expand the sanctuary section too many animals   Also we should be able to sell our supplies like fences deco etc to our neighbors.  I have a lot of stuff that I don’t use that my neighbors could

Hello, I hope you will listen to my simple suggestions. We need the night on the farm, or the change from morning and evening to night. We need climate changes, rain, thunder and sun. We need free farmland and free developments. We need free gems. Please, I hope you add Arabian date trees. It will be fun. We get dates and molasses.
Please make the Farm Pass With some good items. The Free Pass items are more interesting than the Farm Pass Items.
Wow
Wishes for the game:  • Night mode • Seasons, like leaves for fall and snow for Christmas. Like a lot of snow, and the dogs, cats etc leave paw marks in the snow. Thunderstorms in the summer. Rain. • Not having to pay real money to complete collections. • Now it’s only possible to turn items in 2 directions, would love if you could turn it any way you want. • Be able to combine different fences and paths. •  Tom being able to get expansion items.  • Buy decorations for coins not only just diamonds and real money. • Sell decoration and trade with your friends! • The requirements to expand the farm is to high! Please lower!

Link doesn't work??
This update is great, i love love the decorations they're great but will i use them? Most definitely not, just like the rest of the decorations we are consistently given. I can see a lot of work was put into this update but we need more updates for barns, silos, fishing, derbies, town (where is a new building?!), especially neighborhood updates, and especially more ways to keep people entertained. I mean, either way, they're getting people to buy their farm passes..but here recently the decorations are a bit over kill. 10 diamonds for playing for weeks trying to complete these collections is outrageous, making people pay moreeee money to complete them is even more outrageous. Too many decorations and not enough coin, diamond, and rewards distrubution. 8 years I have been playing - they give you less and less rewards and make more and money.
❤
Anyone know how to do the QR code thank

how come the autumn collection ended but i didn't see some of the items like fences, wooden animals, etc being advertised
night mode please 😢😢
Id like for collections to stop being a cash grab. 🚫 Ive yet to complete one collection because at least 4 to 6 items are "shop offers" which is just gambling mechanics.  Thats an absolutely horrible thing to do to players.
Lo pido en español por favor
It late me do it finally I love the decorations you guys come out with 🙃🙂🙃🙂
It won't let me scan that QR code😔
Seria bom se os caminhos de terra fossem mais baratos, não faz sentido ser 8 diamantes, poderia ser 1 ou na máximo 5. Acho os valores das coisas muito alto, ainda mais em dinheiro real.
Dekorların diğer çiftçilerle takas edilebilmesini sağlayın. Aynı dekorlardan çok fazla var. Bir de bizde olan bir dekorun tekrar tekrar çıkmasını engelleyin
Why so many decoration but i dont have many place to decor..nite mode plis😊
It would be nice to move the house anywhere
I would love being able to have a night mode!!
I'm  🇰🇭 Cambodia I like this game Hai day.....😊
We need another food maker. One of them is always busy making bundles of hay to feed the animals and the food buckets for the sanctuary animals. The other one is used for the farm animals. I have a real hard time making enough of either group of animals.
Bu oyunu eskiden çök daha insan oynuyordu okadar çök ürün yapma makinesi çıkardınız bizler sıkıldık bu kadar ürün yapmak sıkıcı biraz azaltın ürün yapma makınesını
In the game, everyone should have a character. They should come to the neighbors' farms to visit. If you do this, the game will be very nice.
اتمنى  من المطورين اضافة البحث عن المنتجات او الادوات في الجريده بحيث يسهل على الاعب ايجاد مايريده في الوقت المناسب  مثلا  انا احتاج  مثلجات الفراوله ابحث عليه في الجريده يطلع عندي كل الصفحات مثلجات الفراوله  اشتري قدر حاجتي  هل هذه فكره جيده يارفاق؟؟
I wish that Rusty and Becky Hosmer would takemy game off you tube and sign out where I could at least "try" yo get tje decorations.
What about more feed production?  What is the point of more sanctuary animals if you can’t feed them?  Why does sanctuary feed take so long to produce?  AND why double experience points as a bonus for selling to farm visitors when you don’t give experience points (only cash) for those actions?  Either add exp points or do away with a stupid reward.
It's very difficult to understand Lavina. I don't mean no harm but if Camila could say all video I would really appreciated.
اضافة البحث عن المنتج المطلوب في الجريده بحيث يسهل الحصول على  اي منتج في وقت الحاجه اليه   الي معي يعمل اعجاب
When our trees die off and we’re have to cut them down, buy the wood and let us make coin!
AMAZING 🎉
Night mode please
Been playing since 2012 and hope to be playing 10 years from now, it’s a wonderful game
Hello get truck faster like valiy truck running plzz ❤
Can you give us timeline of full month like coc, like 1-11 cwl, 1-10 challenge 1, 11-20  challenge 2, etc. They always give us in advance
Soy jugadora desde hace 11 años y me molesta un poco lo dificil que es poder comprar terrenos extra los pergaminos son exageramente dificil de conseguir. Lo que si me a gustado mucho es la decoracion que han estado dando, aunque la exclusividad era algo bonito ahora uno entra a otras granjas y todas tienen lo mismo.
Ormai quasi tutte le decorazioni sono a pagamento. Faccio tutti gli incarichi ma se non spendi soldi veri non puoi completare il libro. Non è giusto e sta diventando noioso.
As duas que mais gostei: modo fotografia e maís de uma entrega do caminhão ao mesmo tempo ❤
Why can't I complete my fishing book, I keep catching the same fish with different hooks and diamond net AND I can't pick up other farmers in my train NO FAIR I'm level 64
Fix the shop where I don't have to scroll all the way down every time. Everything is costing too many diamonds and products. Like 3 sugars and butters. It's becoming a job and less fun. Also things like jelly and  juice take way too long to make.
求你了来个夜间模式吧😊
How about letting us buy these decorations with in game money instead of real money or gems which are purchased oooh look!!! WITH REAL MONEY!!!!
PLEASE take the limit of expansion tools off!!!

My hayday just keeps upgrading in an endless loop.  Upgrades, install starts over again.  Tried to Uninstall and then re enstall no change. Haven't been able to play in over 3 months. Do not want to start over again!! Help please
We need night mode and rainy weather!!!!!!!
Não dá para reclamar a prenda na descrição
We should be able to sell items stored .
As escrituras é um absurdo a quantidade pedida. Deveria diminuir
O tempo de descanso do tom deveria ser menos já que paga tão caro com diamantes pra contratar.
Deveria colocar deixar de seguir do lado adicionar amigo. Assim fica mais fácil quando não quiser mais amizade.
Thank you for the change in editing mode! I certainly will enjoy it :)
Night mode and rain,,plssss
hello every Friends and hay day creators... another month with more and more decorations... there are no place for all!! stop it pleaase and what about new ideas new minigames.... village renovation, more birds, more animals... here you are my suggestions  new crop: avocados and you can make guacamole, avocado salad... peas, beans...   new trees like the walnut tree to get walnuts or the chestnut tree for chestnuts... very autumnal by the way. to make chestnut cake or pie, dried fruit salad...   new birds like the parrot, the pheasant,... the rooster (there are hens, there are chicks but where's the rooster?).   farm animals like the hedgehog or the common turkey or turtles   more animals for the reserve: rhinoceroses, kangaroo, bears, lions, snakes, eagles, hawks, vultures.    New sea fishing area to fish for octopus, tuna, sea bream, shark, whales, dolphins, seahorses, puffer fish, clown fish, swordfish, squid, surgeon fish... and to be able to make a beautiful aquarium!   New machines like the furniture factory to use the wood from so many sawed trees. You can make chairs, tables, wardrobes, beds, mirrors, coat racks...   A mine minigame to extract precious stones like rubies, emeralds, topaz, opals, aquamarines... and diamonds. There would be a new character. Mike the miner and he goes through galleries with his pickaxe. Some are harder and need dynamite and there he could find precious stones. But watch out for the bats that would make you lose everything!   New buildings for the village like the museum, the police station, the fire station, the church, the mill, the library, the hospital, the school...   and new power-ups or events such as one that shortens the time it takes to obtain milk, bacon or wool from pigs, cows, goats or sheep, shortens times on the latest machines and not just the oldest ones, or doubles the production of néctar from bees.  and for now that's enough. Let's see which of all these ideas you do.  I hope you get them all, since I've been sending them to you for a long time and I'd love to see them in the game.   I thank you for including my other suggestions, such as the peacock and the other birds, the penguins, the tortilla stand with the potato omelette (typical Spanish)... keep it up.   Oh, a suggestion. You're making more and more things that you have to pay for with real money, which makes them expensive. I'm one of those who pay, but I'm getting poorer and poorer... please cut costs. Nothing more.   A hug from Pablo from Spain  Bye😊
Meus diamantes sumiram e até agora não tive resposta de vocês. Muito triste
Finally I don’t have to wait for that truck to return to send more orders
نايس  فري نايس
This is good idea😍
the same thing as always. We already have most of the Halloween decorations. They make some updates just to cover your eyes!! They give one thing and remove or increase the tasks... And they don't change or make a remix of that song and other sounds. Since the time of the Vikings! They don't even set it at dusk...much less night!  And until today they haven't removed that absurd thing of 30 or so items to open land or barns!  It's high time!!! because that won't be the only thing that makes you money!!! same of the same 🤯
Mais do mesmo same,same.
Land expansion needed again. I have no room.
Fantastico ❤
Should be able to put Tom on pause for what ever amount of time instead of wasting time with him when busy with what ever it maybe
I really like the new updates. Thanks for continuously improving the hayday gaming experience!
Can you make the production machines more affordable please? They are very expensive! The farm pass pushes you to other levels, which is awsome, but the machines take up all your coins and diamonds, as well as the land decorations you can taylor. To upgrade those are expensive even with vouchers and blueprints. I've been playing for years. I love Hayday
🎉🎉🎉Update idea... just with friends and neighborhood need a private messenger.  Don't always need everyone in the neighborhood to know 2 person business 🎉🎉🎉
Being able to "stack" decorations would be great. (i.e. lights, trees,  buildings, etc.)  Placing items on the paths would really be nice and make beautiful farms.  Being able to move the house would also be lovely.
I wish hay-day can do night mode switch 😊
It's amainz
My favorite game is Hay Day❤
Esses eventos são desmotivadores! Não conseguimos montar as peças e já terminam a campanha! 😢 Porquê tanta sanha assim?!🤷🏻‍♀️ Isso não está sendo divertido, quase tudo tem que ser comprado e realmente, nada nos faz correr para ter nada no final! Hay Day tá cada vez mais chato! Não acatam as melhorias dos usuários e continuam entupindo os celeiros de tranqueiras e ferramentas! Cadê o celeiro pra isso? Prometeram, mas não cumpriram! Tínhamos quase 15 pessoas no grupo, com esses lixos lançados, estamos em 2  e olha, já pensei em cancelar minha fazenda e não descartei ainda a ideia! Muito chato e desmotivador!🤦🏻‍♀️
You guys need to repeat the old event because some new player has not have those decorations so how we gonna filled the deco book
How about some little bridges that connect with the canals? And gates for the fences? Thank you.
Full time employee here, is it possible to complete all the orders? 😢 I don't wanna miss any decorations
Modo de noche por favor !Cuando ?
I am ready!!
I am very happy, thank you Hay Day team
WE DON'T NEED DECORATIONS we want game play!!!!! New animals that do something.
It would be nice  1 to pay so much for the productos.  2 Lower the price of machines are very high  3Do not ask for so much material to enlarge land  4 When buying a product that does not go up with each purchase that stays at the same price, if you buy one they do not raise another currency and so on. With that everything would be perfect.
You guys need to remove expansion limits.
رجعووووووو لنا الثغرة رجائا
Deveria diminuir o tempo de algumas coisas e ser mais fácil velar o nível de máquinas, ganhamos um cartão do Ton de 3 horas mais cara ele faz uma única busca e descansa 2 😂onde já se viu e quando gasto 15 diamante nele, quando contrato ele é pq quero servir e ter q ver ele fazer uma única busca e ficar parado por 2 horas me deixa frustada pq nem sempre tenho este tempo. Jogar a rede de pesca e esperar por 19 horas que loucura o Hay Day está ficando animado, para depressão.
Acho que a Supercell está se perdendo neste jogo criando outros jogos e deixando alguns tipos a fazendinha de lada, ela está ficando muito chata de jogar, precisa de uma atualização completa está ficando sem graça. E olha q eu jogo outros jogos da supercell, Clash of clãs é melhor. Agora a fazendinha precisa de novas ideias.
Quero dois ajudantes extras para cuidar das máquinas onde eles possam fazer tortas, pipocas, sorvetes e todo o tipo de produtos que se fazem nas máquinas. Contratariamos como contratamos os outros ajudantes assim enquanto espero uma torta ou bolo ficar pronto para algum pedido de barco ou caminhão eu estaria produzindo outros produtos.
The best update would be to stop having us pay real money for the rest of the collection, do night mode and weather changing per seasons. Absolutely love this game but we don’t want it damn near impossible to have the new collections and different scenic modes.
Alot of nice things 🤍🤍🤍🤍
De beauty afdeling en de tassen afdeling zou ik niet kunnen overslaan😂
جيد جدا
Very nice and wonderful effort that deserves thanks...Thank you, Hi-D team.
It would be nice if they fixed the diamond bundles of decorations so we don’t get doubles or triples of one decoration. If I’m buying a diamond chest, I want to know exactly what I’m getting before I spend money on them. I ended up buying 4 diamond chests for one decoration. I won’t be doing that again.  Cause it’s a rip off
يمته تحديث جديد
اريد استرجاع مزرعتي لكن لا اتذكر حساب العبه بسبب تغير هاتفي راسلتكم عدة مرات ولم تعالجو لي هذا المشكله علمآ اجبت ع جميع اسئلتكم
It would be great if you had a tool shed for the farm to keep all the tools and all the building materials. I was raised on a farm and we had 3 tool sheds. All the farming neighbors had tool sheds. It could be so cute. It would be so much easier to find those materials. Love the game. Thanks
WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING ANY MALLTS???? I CANT OPEN MY LAND WITHOUT THEM.???? UNLESS YOU ARE GETTING RID OF THEM EITHER WAY NOT FAIR WE NEED MALLTS TO PLAY THE GAME PLEASE FIX THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU.
為什麼我一直收不到遊戲驗證碼？這樣我玩不了小號😢
HD, would love to get more products, production buildings, and different boosters please! No more sanctuary animals.
Acho  que deveria aumentar a quantidade de material pra comprar no dia ,80 é muito pouco e o silo e o celeiro enche muito rápido
Adorei o melhoria nas entregas, realmente é muito chato esperar o carro voltar. E QUEREMOS MODO ESCURO!
oh so his name is Alfred 😁😁😁
Artık yenilikler istiyoruz oynama hevesimiz kalmadı
It would be nice if we got more axes and saws that we use to get! Now it’s so we have to buy diamonds and use diamonds to get anything anymore! I’m not spending cash just to get a few diamonds! It’s sad the game has gotten greedy. Farms look neglected since the game rarely gives back to us. More diamonds and less boosters would help!
Night modeeee
Can we have Masha and bear here
Those town visitors faces not changed so far why don’t you change those characters

O jogo e muito bom , só que para aumentar o terreno demora muito tendo muitas dificuldades e com isso DESMOTIVA😩😩😩😩. O armazém demora muito para aumentar. Espero que nessa nova atualização arrumem isso 😩
Seriously!! What about night mode?😡 we need it , All players want night mode 😡😤 Why don't you respond to us?👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I think we need another mill to help make food for sanctuary animals only!! I think that’s why no one cares if they get more animals, puzzle pieces etc. Makimg the Bales and fish takes way toooo much time!! I’d rather feed my farm animals and that’s enough for me! I turn down puzzle pieces in derby gifts. Don’t care to get any more animals!!
Night mode!!!
My hay day is not connecting for last months   I don't know why😢 please someone tell me why was it's happening 😢😢😢😢
Please, please, please give us another dairy making building, like we have with sugar.
لقد سرق احدهم حساب مزرعتي #9VYRPQP0J هذا هو وهو الآن يستخدمه فهل تساعدوني
Night mode pls 🥹🙏
افظل العمل نهارا
Кто—нибудь может ответить, где теперь находятся чертежи(для создания авторских украшений)?
يارب تعين
🎉
The new collections are kind of fun but I don’t want to have to pay real money to complete them!! It would be great to have some new buildings and helpers instead of just new decorations as well. And could we PLEASE finish one sanctuary animal at a time with the puzzle pieces?!?!
Impossible to keep up with Dairy product needs. You’ve added a lot of machines requiring Dairy but no help to meet needs.
Hi , how are you .. Can you add these things to the game in the future? First: We want to add a favorites button to add favorite farms. Second: We want to add the ability to copy the farm plans of friends or any player in the game and modify them. Like the rest of Supercell games, for example, the game Clash of Clans has the same idea that I mean.
Nice 👍
Nice 👍
OK OK THANK YOU ❤❤😊😊
Time to put down my fall decoration and get ready for Halloween !!!🎃 👻
This is getting boring... every update is only decoration, decoration and decoration.....
We want night mode
Poderia ter a possibilidade de girar a câmera em mais ângulos pois existe alguns pontos cegos e não conseguimos encontrar uma planta para reviver ou apreciar a decoração da fazenda muito bem 😢😢
Ich wünsche mir immer noch Koalabären im Reservat , die Eycalyptus fressen . Der Eycalyptus wird als Baum auf der Farm angebaut . Herstellen kann man dann damit Eucalyptusbonbon in der Süßigkeitenmaschine. Im Blumenladen einen Straus mit Eucalyptus und Eucalyptusbadezusatz im Badkiosk ☺
Make the personal train available to use with all your Friends and not only with members of the neighborhood  Also increase the space of potenciators or add the option to use the extra ones right away
NIGHT MODE PLEASEE!!!!!
❤❤❤
СДЕЛАЙТЕ ДВОЙНОЕ КАСАНИЕ НА АЛИАЗЫ НА ПРОИЗВОДСТВО!!!Я ТАК СЛУЧАЙНО ВСЕ АЛМАЗЫ ПОТРАТИЛА,КОТОРЫЕ СОБИРАЛА НА ОТКРЫТИЕ СЛОТА НА СЕТКАХ!!!ТАК НЕ ЧЕСТНО!!!
All that deco just going right to storage.
هاي داي لا تعمل جيدا من الساعه 6:00 صباحا الى الساعه 12:00 الظهر
هاي داي لا تعمل جيدن  الحداث الذي اقوم بي الحصول عليها لا تضاف الى المزرعه ممكن السباب
The qr cant be scanned :/
‼️‼️‼️Would it be possible that you come up with some machine that makes saws and axes, I’m not the only one complaining about this. It would be a great thing there’s just no saws and axes around. In 3 days I put a request in the bird house for them plus ppl any coming out and complaining that there just isn’t any around, while our trees, bush’s and flowers are building up at the end of our farm, soon I’m going to have to start deciding want I have to put in storage 🥲, and is there away to get rid of decorations a person doesn’t like tyvvm hope you see this‼️‼️‼️
I'm sick tired of not being able to get all the items from a collection cause I  refuse to use real money in a game, so no matter I play since year one, what I  do doesn't matter cause I'm not a paying customer, that sucks from you...
❤
And I want deposit money into the game but I living in Việt Nam so I can't Help  me pls
Why is the game buffering between different areas
LET US SELL OUR EXTRA DECORATIONS!!!!
Why I cant not Watch promotional videos to save time on products? Help me do that
I wanna be able to sell my excess decorations. I dont need 29 of anything unless it's fence pieces or pathways. I want to he able to spend 3 diamonds for a single one time favor from Tom. My life is too busy to spend 15 diamonds to have tom for a whole day and not even be able to use him each time he's available in that time period. I wanna be able to have more time in between ships to fill thise orders. These are changes that would make sense to me.
Finally an undo button!!! TY TY TY TY TY TY TY TY TY TY TY! 🤗
All I want is a night mode
The game is no longer like it used to be
Ya need to add a permanent maker thingy to which it changes looks by whatever seasonal event is going on n also ya need to add a tool shed that has unlimited storage that holds all of non goods made to store expansion materials
Mode nyolong
Como puedo reclamar la decoracion de  halloween que estan regalando, alguien puede ayudarme con los pasos?.  Gracias!!
Beautiful game!
I would like to be able to buy all three options in the valley. It would also be interesting to have a town with real players moving and selling stuff. How about a public chat board and a place in Hay Day where we can talk and get to know each other? A market with players would be great, and why not add a customizable person that resembles us?.
Getting fed up you make it to difficult to get land it’s becoming boring you need to play all day to get tasks done some of us have a life, I used to play to relax it’s so intense now
Need more animals, have a lot of vouchers and no animals to use them on.
Wow the truck order update is huge!! Maybe I'll finally be able to complete that one quest...
مرحبا بكم ارجو اضافة ترجمة فوريةبين أعضاء الحي و الاحياء الآخرى اتمنى منكم الرد بسرعه لان بعض الاحياء لغات مختلفه ولا تستطيع التواصل معهم (تحياتي لكم)🌷💐💐💖
Muy bonito todo pero cuando se centrarán en el derby? Por que no le dan a los  jugadores medallas del color de la copa q ganó el vecindario ? Que se puedan lucir en la barra para obtener reputación y si uno cambia de vecindario ya s e sabe q clase de jugador es con solo ver sus medallas,las Copas ganadas quedan para el vecindario pero es un equipo y a cada jugador no se le da ni copa ni medalla ya es hora que se centren en premiar a los jugadores de derby con una 🥇🥈🥉algo así sería,si el vecindario ganó oro  le dan  una medalla de oro al jugador,si fue plata o bronce lo mismo y entonces podrá lucirla en su barra de su granja,todo es deci nada para los jugadores d e derby q damos mucho esfuerzo y las recompensas son pocas y feas, 1 herradura 5 azúcar moreno ? 🥺 o 2 picos ? Creo q ustedes se dedican solo a los q decoran y gastan pero yo y muchos más somos puro derby y deberían recompensarnos con una medalla cada derby
Will request hay day to add more animals on simple vouchers
Kunnen jullie ook het filmje in nederlans doen
How do we claim the gift
Why can't we stop the booster ? Just for a while like ( Tome ) I can’t use it for 25 hours
Nıght.   Modeeeeplease
I have not played games for a long time and I still have to buy a machine and I don't have machine, what should I do?
Change the marial lomit per day or to be bigger based on level
Por favor no entiendo el inglés, lo podían subtitular en español, gracias
❤❤❤❤❤
This game stole My money... I paid real money to get diamonds and now they are gone whit no trase of them. And hay Day support told me they are not going to do anything about this.... Really sad about this thing..😢
Por favor que las máquinas tengan menos tiempo de hacer las comidas y cuesta mucho conseguir las herramientas y el dinero que uno gana es muy poco la vez pasada la elimine por los mismos les pido si pueden mejorar que sea eso por qué el disfrazar a los animales no ayuda en nada
Meus queridos criadores .... poderia deixa as declarações no catálogo da fazenda para podemos compra com diamantes ou com moedas por favor não consigo pegar as declarações pois vem sempre repetindo e não tenho como está comprado diamantes....por favor...
Deberían poder permitir que entre nosotros nos mandemos diamantes y tickets o decoraciones que se puedan vender
I will like to do multiple derby tasks at once.
Una muy buena actualización,  sería que nos pongan un depósito exclusivo para los materiales y herramientas 😊
More sanctuary animals!? Stop adding! Its hard just to complete one animal because your game doesn't work on one!
I think a tag sale would be fun, to get rid of unwanted items in storage
Please add optional feed maker for wilderness animals
شوفولنه حل اريد مزرعتي تعبت عليهة اهواي حرام عليكم
Can we have more Halloween fences please?? The old ones I mean!
يمعودين  مسؤولين شركة سوبر سيل وينكم اتشوفون التعليق لولا مزرعتي راحت لان فقدت الحساب اريد ارجعهة اذا المجيب الالي ما يرجعهة انتو رجعوهة مثل قبل مخلين المساعد الالي شسوي بي اني اريد جواب
Nice...now...Rose and Ernest need grandson/granddaughter to help feed horses, cats, dogs, etc. Tom needs a bike! Thanks.
How can I claim the gift? I'm on a tablet
Wowwww love it Hay Day thank you 😍
Why do animals live on a farm? There should be gnomes living on the farm. In the pool, on the sleigh and in the bathhouse and so on. Enough animals. Make normal decorations with gnomes!😢😊❤
😂😂👑👑
نبي الثغره ترجع🧐
I’m in love with this game 💗
And supercell
لدي اقتراح هو ان استطيع ان اضيف للالات منتج دون ان اخذ المنتجات الجاهزه حتى يسهل علينا في الديربي مهمة الانتاج واقتراح اخر للبلده هو ان كل شخصيه يظهر كم عددها دون ان نقوم بعدها بانفسنا وشكراً
Bring night mode!! It would look soo good
Love you hay day
Is it possible to have a real life day/night time depending on your region? That would be an awesome feature ❤
can you add some mini games pleasee
love all the new updates!!❤
Kod okunmuyor
Great job on this project! I really appreciate all the hard work that went into making it a success. The attention to detail and dedication to the task at hand is truly impressive. I can see the passion and commitment you put into this work, and it truly shows. Keep up the excellent work and know that you have my full support!
We hope that you will provide the hatchet and saw because we find it difficult to obtain them and reduce the prices of production machines because their prices are very high. They require money and we cannot buy them.
STOP it with suggesting night mode!!!!!!! I love hay day the way it is! No more changes
Instead of those useless sanctuary animals I would still love to get new ones for the farm like ostriches, alpacas or wooly pigs to create new products on the farm
Vote for 🌃 night mode❤
finally, ive been waiting for that farm edit mode improvement
PLS, No simple scenic mode. WE NEED FULL FARM SCENIC MODE!! PLS!!! 🙏😞🥺
It's that red rooster game that keeps popping up every now and then. Luckily for me I just keep things to myself whnercrr there's an oversupply of advertisements on a regular basis. But there's not enough room to complain about the issue—mainly because it's not one of the problems I would deal with knowing the gravity of the situation as a whole.
How to can on ipad
I am Indian  I can not  understand  English
The DEINSTALL Mode for this Game is soooo on Point!
Pleeeaseeee let us buy seasonal trees 🙏🏻😄🙏🏻 the ones that change with the seasons like the ones we all cut down 😭😭😭😭
Hello hay day team  Actually I'm contact in game gmail platform and now here  I lost access to my account because Yahoo will deactivate my account reason-inactivity gmail platform tell me please make a dispose account and contact in game then i make 3 of account and contact there in last week's of many times but my problem still not solved please help me
This is such a great quality of life update. Keep up the great work folks!!!!
Great updates!  Can't wait for October 🎃🕷️🌕
Please make an option for night mode! A lot of us would love it! ❤
What happened to the poisonous mushroom log???  You mentioned it in the fall video and it was never made available.  I play every day and every event, never saw it.
pls add feature remember zoom if move to another farm
👍🏻
We need night moode plz
i hate haloween...better to have fall or autumn teams. Arent you europians? why demonic decorations?
So excited for the edit mode updates!
The halloween decoration is so damn cool ❤ cant wait to prepare my farm for halloween. I wish the spooky ghost at fishing area reward us with expansion materials and new decoration.. its a long time since we had greg calendar and gift box collection. Please add greg calendar too this time🙂
I wish puzzle pieces were easier to get. Takes forever to get Sanctuary animals
Apart from decoration hay day haven't added anything else they are not thinking about barn and silo nor fishing area train area hay day is getting boring hay day era will be end soon if they will not do anything interesting 😅😅
Nice 😊😊😊
Hola desde Chile ..les comento que yo jugaba HAY Day con gusto porque me relajaba hacerlo...pero ahora ya no quiero jugar porque siguen y siguen incorporando actualizaciones y hacen que me estrese más que relajarme. Y desde que esta la competencia de vecindarios ...las tareas y las ferias ...AGOTA tanta tarea. Además no se gana aunque uno cumpla con todo. Bueno eso es todo. Gracias por leer
I'm at 21/25 cheak vouchers, maybe new pets or birds?
Gracias hay day por tan hermosos adorno y por los eventos están maravillosos me encantan estos eventos.
El serdito de cabello largo se parece a la niña del pozo de las pelis o la leyenda de Nicaragua una mujer alta con el cabello adelante la cosemos como la segua pero en hay day es un serdito
My hope is that someday we will be able store production buildings that we bought but don't use, instead of us having to have them take up space.
Very beautiful ❤❤❤❤
WHY..??? Have the tasks got ALOT HARDER...I had to  ake 16 bottl3s of grape juice e in only 26 hr..IMPOSSIBLE s
free diamond for demolish tree  like coc please
En français svp  je n’ai rien COMPRIS😢
direct massage is awesome.
Melhora o jornal tbm com a atualização tá difícil conseguir comprar as coisas pq nunca tem nada disponível e quando atualiza já está comprado, por favoooooooooor
Por que no agarra el codigo😢
Consegui ❤
Fixing the issues would be great
Hard to do night mode with different time zones. Rather not have the hassel.
It's more awesome with night mood ,and i hope hay day will update with night mood for Halloween ❤
Like the last event, you guys never gave us the things to get it
All these items and no space to put them. We need more scrolls and land.
would be good with an upgrade with the no of pax in visitor town pls. Keep up the good work guys.. appreciate 😊
Love it new update
Por q no puedo escanear el adorno Este?
There is a problem, the app shows no connection and turns off when I watch the daily tickets or even for get faster production
Is there a link for this
WE WANT NIGHT MODE
How to get the giv
SANCTUARY: please. Can there only be a limited number of puzzles/animals in progress at any one time? I have 3  puzzles (1 only needs 1 more piece) almost completed and instead of completing them new puzzles are started which means I have 7+ puzzles in progress. It gets frustrating.
Porque siempre que entro a comprar algún producto en el periódico ya está vendido 😢
I don't use tickets to make different color fishing lures anymore because it's been months since I got a new fish. It's a waste of my tickets. Also it would be nice if they expanded the fishing area
i love this season!!!! 👻🎃☠️🕸️🦇🕷️⚰️👽
Tom needs to sleep while I am sleeping please
I loved the pig with the hoop, it's incredible, as is the ghost pig, I really like that they now include QR codes with decorations for the farm in the videos, I would like the market to come back so I can sell the repeated objects to other players who may not have them, I would also like to be able to superimpose decorative objects, for example, if I want to put a path and on top of that a plant or vase, that would be great because it would give the player more freedom to decorate, I don't know, it's an idea. Thanks.
Can you guys please update the items to be more common for upgrading the land and make elderly helpers more useful
احلى شي من ترجع السياره بسرعه
Please. Separate storage for expansion items. Please.
There are tons of maps - I recognize that because they’re available to sell unlike puzzle pieces that they can’t be “removed” for players who don’t need them anymore. Could it be possible to have an item that uses them? An idea I had was to make a bouquet that uses 1 newspaper/item to “wrap” the bouquet or to make paper flower bouquets.   Love the game though!!!!
Its such a good update i love it!!!!!!!
رجعو ثغره
I don’t care so much about night mode, but I’d like for rose and Ernest to be able to gather the items they need for their tasks we have paid them to do.  These are AMAZING updates. Decorating is my favorite.
لعبتي المفظله😊
🙃🙂🍀
I could’ve got both baby ostriches with all the puzzle pieces that floated off into no where land 😑 Glad you’re at least removing them when not able to collect.
Porque no lo traducen también en español
Link please
If You are going to keep adding more sanctuary animals.The sanctuary needs to be bigger, so add another area to the sanctuary space
Cool decor! So fun! Can we get a CLOSED mode to avoid visitors stopping by the farm so often? or maybe some new characters?
Always so amazing love your hard work for such a fun game 🎃
I want Hay Day to have days and nights.
Enough with all these damn decorations!!! I need scrolls so I can open my land. They are so beyond rare! And needing 20 scrolls and 70 of each stakes deeds and mallets to open land is just crazy! You have become a money grab game. I barely have enough to live off of each month never mind sink it into diamonds. 11 years of this game and it's crazy!
who is sick. of the fishing event having no new fish i have all fishing slots use all i use all my coloured tokens to catch fishing absolutely nothing new even keep all fishing tokens to get heavier fish nothing this has been happening for ages now  also the daily task for tool sale nothing all that has got asked for last thrree times is food and crops what’s the point forgetting about the old stuff just to put new games on i. level 189 do t know why i still play really they not interested in players who played for a long time gettibg boring and have inevsted a lot of money in game  rip off hayday
Where is the free deco???? YOU FORGOT!
Night mode
There is a problem with the QR code and I cannot scan it.
Unable to claim the item from scanner in video
who is sick of fishing event having no new fish i have all my fishing plots i also use all my couloured tokens to catch fish nothing new no new weights i put everything i can i to fish ending events complained nothing gets done and also daily events for instance the one where you sell yr decorations and tools nothing happens last three times they just ask for food i’m on level 189 don’t really know why i’m still playing to be honest , Getting boring they just concentrate on keeping game up to date rather then introducing new stuff
LEMONADE STAND
Need to expand or refresh the fishing hole.   Need to add another dairy!!
How to use the qr code?
Add a search for a specific item directly! Also put NPCs moving around the farm, it would be more realistic and interactive like the existing helpers!
Put the newspaper in grid mode instead of as a single sheet! Passing through the sheets wastes time and we miss out on buying the items we want.
HELL YEAH!🎃🍁🍂👻🍭🍬
Can we have new production building? Been a year or more since a new one
THANK YOU! for the edit mode! That always drives me crazy when trying to edit and the side bar gets in my way! A lot of nice upgrades!
THANK YOU FOR THE NEW EDIT MODE THANK YOUUUU
Como conseguir el codigo QR
Night mode🙏🙏🙏
still waiting for a new permanent building. hopefully you guys are working on a big, real update!!! not just decorations we cant place because there's not enough room!!
About ( EXPANSION/UPGRADE NATERIAL PURCHASE DAILY LIANE ) Please Raise it to 500 or ♾️
This is epic 😍😍
I enjoy Hay Day, however, the focus on all these gadgets and decorations are ridiculous. The creators and tech team need to focus on items that help with the building , expansion, and acquisition of tools to improve the farm. It is so hard to get materials that are needed for the farm. People who want the “cutesy “ decorations have them buy the decorations and drop the prices of new machines or other high priced items or necessities. Also give farmers the option of gettting rid foxes with tools. I HATE foxes!
Night mode on please
saçma sapan üretim sürelerini elden geçirin . hababam üretim malzemesi satıyorsunuz  koyacak yer yok . genişletmede bankör davranın acayip cimrisiniz
OMG.!! 😮 I can't wait for the update I'm already in love with the edit mode and the Halloween decorations.!! ❤😊
My farm is little Because of all the special events I have tons of scrolls and cannot get the simple land expansions Look in the paper...ALWAYS...someone already bought this!! Been wheating... Trying everything 😠
I’m glad edit mode is getting an upgrade. I would really like to see a feature where you can “cut” and paste a section of your farm elsewhere. It’s difficult to replicate a complex section of your farm just because you want to move it somewhere else.
Modo nocturno por favor 😢
Can you please make the animals storage available? Sometimes I’m fed up of them and I want to get rid of them, and I cant.
Can somebody tell me what is the use of the all animal in the farm? The birds, and the dogs, and the cats, etc? Except that they give xp? What’s their other use, other than taking space from the farm? Like I really want to know.
Land deeds are not easy to earn or get
Can’t get tree watched it 5 x
FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY!!!
Halloween is my favorite!
Make puzzle pieces easier to get…. It takes more than a month to just get one sanctuary animal. I’m planning to stop playing after more than 10 years playing hay day
I love this! For me it is quite useful, thanks ❤❤
Ok I like these updates👏🏽👏🏽
Azerbayjan Hay Day 298R2888G Id❤
We need night mode .
❤❤❤❤❤ هاي داي اجمل
I don’t know if  y’all gonna see this or not Hay Day team but my farm has a problem where I’m not able to watch videos to cut 50% time off production it just won’t let me click on the thing it just shows a gray box
What would be an awesome improvement would be the option to hire Tom on a 1 time basis, for like 2 diamonds each time. He can still have his “rest” time, but sometimes you only need him for 1 thing and to have to hire him for a full day, or wasting a booster for a 1 time use is very frustrating.
I wanna contact you for more attractive and adorable ideas will make the game more fun for players from everywhere, but I don't know how
Hola Hay Day para cuando una actualización para el área de pesca 🎣🐟🐠 llevo años jugando y aun no he podido completar el libro de pesca lo han dejado en el olvido😢. Porfavor hagan algo por eso
great atts, but fishing area and city need changes
I already have the mausoleum deco.  Too bad it's not something new.
Yea, I should probably get back to playing Hay Day now-
Would be nice sell the old decoration to the team Hay Day....
Woww hay day team love all this new things ❤❤❤ can't wait for halloween 🎃
كولي والعباس
Thanks Camilla,  this game is awesome,  please more free diamond 💎

Are we going to get the planter box that was supposed to come with the summer edition of dairy news before you all took a vacation because it prevented us getting the decoration addition for that set.

Permitan vender decoraciones que no ocupemos necesitamos dinero. Las maquinas cada vez mas caras😢😢
Night mode rainy seasons please
اليش خليتو لالة صنع دونت الكثير من نقود🤔🤔🤔
Alsoooo please make way to sell or trade old decorations. We don’t always love the million and one decorations that come out over the years…
Would really enjoy some new production animals. Could have beef cows who workout to generate the beef. It’s been fun but all the decorations and sanctuary animals are kind of getting repetitive. Please take a thought into some production animals. Thank you
Que está temporada de Halloween 🎃 empiece desde el primero de octubre para aprovechar todo el mes por favor 🎉🎉🎉
Pls allow us to add or delete players/followers from their stand instead of the book…it takes so long to find them as well a sort feature for the barn and silo so that we can rearrange from most to least or fastest production to slowest 🤞🤞🤞
EEEE YAYYYYYY
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Please please please stop putting decorations for collections in shop for real money or make alternative ways for your users to get them. Please please please make it easier to expand land… there’s no room for these decorations that are coming out EVERY UPDATE AND PASS. And pleaseeee do not give farm pass tasks for production buildings that the user doesn’t own. With all the xp given when completing the farm pass, I sometimes can’t afford the next production building. Then takes awhile to obtain those coins, and get back tracked between all of these different events and tasks :( I’ve basically have been playing since hay day started. Since then, I play maybe a couple days out of the month as it’s just become a hassle to do anything. :(( truly a shame
I’m 30 years old, I’m waiting this update like a baby, but still no rain
Great looking update! Patiently waiting for swampy water ditches  :)
Lots of good stuff in this one!
Best update so far!
Raising money is difficult. I hope to find a solution
Night mode plz
Can we please get more stickers that we have missed ,please ❤
A town building laundry mat ...just ask for anything clothing related
Welcome 🎉
The real upgrade for me would be to remove the Expansion scrolls to unlock the new terrains 🙌🙌
Ability to collect puzzle pieces faster would be helpful
Please add back the witch gnomes too 😭😭😭😭
ارجو استخدام ميزه الليليه لليل 😢 احب المزرعه بشكل لا يصدق
Please allow more fish to fill the fishing book.
OMG I can,t wait, I love the decorations
NIGHT MODE
I don’t have espacio
Night mode, please
Level 167 playing at least 10 years. Would love a night mode and if you miss a decoration in a task give us the option to buy it.
I wish there were place to store puzzles when you are already done so you can use them when you get new animals
Legal 😊gostei 👍
Buenas en cima que los videos están en inglés la traducción también está me parece que debería ponerlo en español 😢
Decorations sucks I prefer new machines
Uma boa atualização seria buscar itens no jornal pela lupa. Ou ao menos que os que nos faltam apareçam mais ao invés de ficarem mais difíceis como acontece atualmente. (A good upgrade would be to search for items in the newspaper using the magnifying glass. Or at least that the missing items appear more instead of becoming more difficult as they currently do.)
Quiero otra maquina de leche y más  productos nuevos  esa maquina es solo por el evento
There are a lot of really good updates/improvements but please please please add something like a trading booth. 🙏🏼🙏🏼
I hate halloween!
New decorations means more bare land needed. We can go into settings and get a new farm landscape and start all over with fresh farm whilst keeping our original farm landscape. Only issue with this is our trees and bushes that have to be placed first before we can decorate, the problem with this is that by the time you have to place each individual tree and/or bush, you’re so tired you lose interest. The trees and bushes need to have that storage option. Please 🙏
Excelente
Thank for decorating 😊🎉
Where is the yard sale?
Its really get boring if you are not having diamonds to get Tom  Tom's sleeping mode gets too long to get anything from market  There must be some other vias to buy required items  Its really disrespectful that you joined a neighborhood but thet kick you out without any reason....not good  Pls make this game more interesting by introducing approachable items rathers buying them with real money....
Night mode pls 😢😢😢
Lütfen köy arkadaşlarımıza dekorasyon verebilelim plssss
This game now is on the wrong path, please developing new derby or something fun to play, instead of leading people to play with real money, so limit way to gain but so expensive to spend diamonds, don’t lose your IP !
I'm loving these updates, the game was so stagnant and now it's making me want to play more, I hope you guys always keep changing the scenery according to the season, it would be so nice to have snow in winter, changes to day and night and more interactions like this :)
@hayday Derby ? Halloween
Sounds 👻SPOOKTACULAR👻....   Will there be items we can buy using VOUCHERS , COINS also?
Can you make getting land easier all these decorations and nowhere to put them, getting land is too hard… or allow to buy land , thanks!
want night mode,,,,
Do you guys ever do anything original? I'm convinced all people at hay day could be replaced with robots and nobody would notice.  Same events, same concept of production buildings, same seasonal themes, same-looking decorations
make it so we can move stuff in sections! like we put a box around the area we want to move and then we can move it all together!!!
مساء الخير  ارجو منكم تعديل وضع الحضائر حيث لا تستوي كثيراً الا بمشقة واكتساب مواد يعصب الحصول عليها لفترة تطول
Me gusto micho 🙂 todo lo que viene sobre todo la maquina temática. Gracias por las mejoras chicos. Seria genial modo nocturno 🙏
Fix my roadside shop! Its not working at all, I cant sell anything out of it and support allways says it will work in next update, well it isnt! I have playing over 10 years :(
Modo noite por favor 🌾👩🏻‍🌾😍
We don’t need anymore decorations
‼️😩 MORE TOWN AREA, BEACH and TOWNIES‼️  Enough sanctuary already!!!
Please change your age update I can't join my friend farm 😔
oh damnnnnnnnnnnnnn im gonna go hammmm on this update RIP my wallet. :(
No puedo leer el código QR me perderé la decoración 😢
How do I collect new decoration?
NIGHT MODE PLS
When will y’all add blueberries?
SAI DAQUI, NUNCA SERÁ UM COLHEITA FELIZ
I like new updates
I hope when U put your decorations away U don't loose them I hope they go in your box as I like to do up my town and farm for the different seasons such as Christmas Halloween valatince day fall and other thing but when they are over I like to put them away till they come back around
Love the new deco (thank you!) & the multiple truck order thing, but what would REALLY make my day is to work on only ONE sanctuary animal at a time. It's *very* discouraging to be collecting all the puzzle pieces I can possibly get my hands on...I'm thinking, "Surely this is enough for a new animal..." & I go to the book & look & there's one here...one there...one somewhere else. Hey, I'm getting old here. I'm starting to think I'm going to pass before I get another animal. You don't want to be responsible for my depression, do you?? 🤣
NIGHT MODE
NIGHT MOD
I just subscribed to you guys. You gave me a free decor. There’s any more videos I  missed with free decor ?
PLEASE   - Reduce the producing time for some products (like for a big example the Jams) - Reduce the price of the producing machines  - reduce price of the lobster pool is very expensive to upgrade
Верните недельные события с кристаллами, что же вы стали такими жадными
Hows about SuperCell start listening to the requests for Hay Day instead of just the requests for Squad Busters. That game has recieved all the improvements people requested. Plus already got a collab. They just leave Hay Day in the dust , or have bad developers working on it apparently.
A tool shed but I doubt you will do that because we have been asking for that forever.
So happy for the paint brush !! So frustrating having to find the item again 🎉. Can we get a new location some time soon? There’s a lot of opportunity to do new things.
Give us enough puzzle pieces to finish the animals we are trying to complete before you add more.
Hello, Hi Day, we are a beautiful family and the updates are beautiful too. But there is a very small problem, which is collecting money and diamonds. Is it possible for you to reduce the price of the next Halloween house? 💔 I need to buy it, it is very beautiful 😭😭
Modo noturno 😊🙏🏻😉
Love all these updates, can’t wait for Halloween deco!
Não gosto
ENOUGH WITH THE TEMPORARY MACHINES!!!!!!!!!   NO MORE TEMPORARY STUFF!!!!!!!!!   IT'S REALLY DRIVING MY TEMPER!!!!!!!!!
Love Halloween, I wait for the new decorations every year - this is going to be fun!!
Thank you! That’s exciting! Also being able to get that witch I missed two years ago would be great
Hay Day, please add a Snake to the ZOO 😊🐍🙏
pls let us delete pig farms with no animals in them
great to see many asking for night mode maybe we'll see it actually happen one day!
Can't wait 🎉🎉🎉
gece modu ve yanıp sönen ev veya çiftlik aydınlatmaları hallowen için güzel olurdu
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Being able to sell decorations would be a great addition to the game!
🎃🍁🍂theses amazing
Night mode plssss😭
Amei tudo!! 😍 Agora falta atualizar as decorações do ingresso do cinema, e o modo noturno 🙌🏼
Love this update!! So cute! Thanks!
I do not know how to get the Halloween tree.  Does it come with the update.
Uma forma de ganhar mais expansão de terra. Impossível conseguir e comprar na loja! Quando aparrce ja ta vendido! Depender de doações cansa, desanima. Do que adianta tanta decoração se não tem terra pra colocar. To quase desistindo do jogo. 😢
sounds awesome thanks hay day
الثغره رجعوها بليييييييز 😢😢😢
الثغره رجعوها بليييييييز 😢😢😢
Please update the town
Great fixes in this update!
Please Khmer title in the video
I’m not wasting permits and land expansion items on the sanctuary.
Tem que ter modo noturno, isso é halloween, com chuvas e trovas e a tochas iria ilumina o local, seria perfeito.
Wow ya no puedo esperar
I want to be able to earn diamondsss
More sanctuary animals? No thank you. Puzzle pieces come so rarely that completing an animal takes long enough already.
Night Mode pls
love it! I downloaded hayday after years again because I was so excited for halloween decorations 😆😆😆
Not everyone enjoys Halloween. It should be optional.
A mosolium?! Black roses?!   OH HECK YES!!!!   My witchery is happy 😊
Love hallowennnnn😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🫶💜💜✨
Pretty excited about the truck order changes, though I was expecting more of a system where you can add multiple truck orders to one truck then pressing a button to confirm sending off the truck with x amount of orders, not the queue system shown in this video but I’ll take what I can get lol
Have had the mausoleum for years.  Give us something new and option of getting items that we have never received but others that are on lower levels somehow have multiples of!
Can someone share the link for the deco?
I don’t celébrate Halloween at all not interested in having any decorations. But it’s good for the ones who like it.
9 years 10 months to go until I get all the LAND..I've already been playing for 10 years. I have ZERO ROOM FOR MORE DECOR. Please give a hoot about your players. We need land and clearly the majority want night mode. I play this a whole lot less and have refused to give you money because you just don't care about us, the players.. I get you signed agreement with Google play and have to fork over a percentage to them, but we the players shouldn't suffer your greed. You want player money, give us land and night mode. But I'm not paying developers that are greedy and do not at all listen to us, the players. I like Sparkling Society games now, I get land quick with them, and they don't try to get my money.
Add more land
How about more space for the zoo area.
😈💀☠️
Les meilleures décoration d'Halloween merci l'équipe hay day j'ai vraiment hâte que sa arrive
واخيرا راح تتغير الشاحنة ويصير ارسال الطلبات اسرع 🫶🏻💜 من زمان اشكي منها بالدعم 😅
Add cloud effects for Halloween
We need sausages and blueberries yah
Todo lindo pero nunca puedo completar el álbum
L❤v hai dai Thank😊
It would be nice if we could do multiple board tasks at a time
Can’t wait for those new Halloween items!! 🎃👻💀
It only took u guys 14 years to add a better edit mode😂
نريد إرجاع الثغرات
Oh lord 👏👏👏👏 thank you for the erase edit mode…..love these improvements ❤️❤️
:000
I love this grl .
We need options to decorate inside the home, with cute kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room items please ❤🙏
add night mode and rain
Maravilhoso 👏👏👏
Merci pour ce cadeau
Night mode PLEASEREEE
Szuper ❤❤❤
Love all the new additions. However, we have no room for all the awesome things!!!! No saws to rid the trees and land too expensive to build.
Does anyone know the name of the Hay Day email?
Esta muy bien pero necesitamos más ampliación de terrenos tanto en la granja  como en el pueblo para la reserva  de animales gracias
I suggest to hayday team to make cancel mode for all machine, because sometimes i did wrong item to make and need Times to finish that wrong item and did make item which i need, i wish hayday team can do my wish 😊
MULTIPLE TRUCK ORDERS YES
LET US SPEND COINS FOR DECOS! I’m not a millionaire and can’t  keep throwing real money at a game. I’m at the point that I may delete the game because it’s too expensive to get what I want.
Love loveeee Halloween
Sadako pig 😂
AD nên ra tính nang tang coin cho ban bè
Please no more sanctuary... There are so many animals I don't even have. Please add new items for production buildings.
Should be fun
We need Night mode😭😭😭
Night mode pls
Donde está el código q?
PLEASE give us the option to delete pets.
I tried the QR code twice, it said it can't be read.
Yo compré un paquete 😢y no me llegó el adorno 😮
Какие вы большие молодцы❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love
I WOULD LOVE NIGHT MODE even just temporary for this halloween event
Just decorations. No new content basically. I miss when we used to get new production buildings, new crops and fruit trees. 😥
Please test night mode also to make the halloween decorations spookier
Hey guys could anyone explain to me how to get the task event decorations? I'm a bit confused, just redownloaded the game so i missed out on updates :)
Essa é a atualização que eu quero.  Maquinas: Produtos novos para máquinas antigas por favor. Novas máquinas. Duplicar a máquinas de doces e de geleias. Ajudaria muito.    Produtos com morangos: Suco de morango 🍓  Óleo essencial de morango 🍓   Cidade: Novos prédios na cidade e novos  visitantes.  Rio: Novos tipos de peixe. Coloquem ostras no lago. Poderemos fazer novas comidas com o marisco e coletar perolas produzindo novas joias.   Mina: Coloquem um novo metal na mina (bronze, latão...)  Pedras preciosas (rubi, safira, esmeralda, rubelita...)  Laticínios: Mais vacas Uma nova maquina de ração  Uma segunda fabrica de laticínios.  Animais: Mais abelhas e esquilos. Criem um novo animal tipo bicho da seda. Poderemos criar uma infinidade de produtos como vestidos de seda, chapéus, laços.  Ideias de máquinas:  1. Laços  2. Leques 3. Gelatina  Algumas ideias para movimentar o jogo.  Por favor leiam.  Grata.
Very good

Top Demais
Hay day is the best game!!! Please introduce night mode and that we can make our own people to look like us
Night mode pls
The best thing I found is that I can move the car quickly, and this is excellent for me
Please stop making us spend money or insane amount of diamonds to finish deco collections
Que legal amei as novidade ❤❤❤❤❤😂
Me ajudem a recuperar minha fazenda por favor  Marcia  70

How do we claim the QR
Night mode😢
Please do Fall decorations instead of summery ones by watching the trailers (movie tickets)
The update is nice…. But I love GUJARATI…❤you add ગુજરાતી…
night modeee
Please make it so fences fit together, even if they are different. Would also like more space or areas to build, like another town or something.  Also, please make it so we can sell excess decorations please instead of waiting until farm visitors buy them in groups of 3.
Upgrade the town pleaseeeee
Hay Day just gets better and better!
❤
لابد من تقليل مده إنتاج المنتجات التي تستغرق وقت طويل وزيادة الهدايا المفيده ومطلوب تطوير في الوادي وتسهيل اللعب فيه
It's Halloween season, but this feels like Christmas! 👻🎁
I just need planks 😅
1-ادوات تطوير الحظيرة والصومعة يجب ان تكون بكثرة في الجريده او الهدايا 2- عجلة الحظ يجب ان تكون ذو هدايا ذات قيمة 3ـ يجب تقليل وقت تجهيز المنتجات 4ـ اختيار زينة من الزينات تدل على معالم العراق الاثرية مثل بر بابل او الثور المجنح او مسلة حمورابي  5- شكرا لكم ولجهودكم
I’m very excited for these changes omg I love the edit changes ❤❤❤❤
How can i delete and get rid of some items that are in my storage? I dont have any use for all the things in there and would rather get rid of them or sell them if thats possible.
Das runterladen der Dekoration funktioniert nicht! Der QC--Code funktioniert aber das antippen zum runterladen funktioniert nicht.🥲
I want night mode.
Awesomeness as always HayDay ❤. I love my HayDay ❤
Please bring air transport too.
Night mode and turn on the lamp when night please
Thank you so much for the edit mode update🙏🙏. Been waiting for that one for a while 😄
😊
Night mode and rainy mode PLEASEEEEE
3:56 That’s soooooo coooool🎉
I wish each crop in the harvest had a separate end of harvest notice. I don't like to wait the longest period of harvest to send the notice. For example, tomatoes ready to crop, tea ready to crop, strawberry ready to crop, Who is with me?
Clean mode but not Night mode😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Please, more farms to decorate with different themes. I have the limit of 5 and have so many more ideas. Paying with diamonds is ok  MORE BLANK FARMS PLEASE
That changes i love it😌
🎉🎉🎉🎉
We are getting so many gifts but what about space we need more lands n wolf as a pet please 🙏
Night mode please
Maggie sets NEED rework.. the price is ridiculous. It shouldn't cost so much or at all really after you have already bought them
We need wolf 🐺 please hayday bring wolf as a pet
Please show link or Qr code better. The  transcript letters block the Qrcode reade
Please make it little easier to get puzzle pieces
Hello guys thanks for the inclusion of mango tree in hay day game but there are more products we should try to include in hay day game like 1 mango ice cream, 2 mango cake 3 mango jam 4 mango pie 🥧 5 mango pickle and mango delex we  should include in hay day game,  why we ain't have the request for boosters (only one at time) lobster traps duck traps  ,vouchers and net makers
Por favor me ajudem perdi minha quinta em Nome de Zezinha por favor N168 pf me ajudem
Night mode please according to real time in each country
🧛‍♀️👻🧡🧡🖤🧡🧡👻🧛‍♀️
❤❤
Adorei, uma sugestão é nas próximas atualizações atribuir no modo edição a possibilidade de comprar itens da loja para decorar
You really needs to stop the  surprise deco . It a waste of diamonds.
Night mode ☹️
Die qr code werkt nooit  Heb nog geen een geschenkje via die qr code
Please don’t tell me those Mag decorations are gonna be 500k coins
The temporary production building and tying it to the ship is the least enjoyable event for me.
Pour les décorations halloween, depuis des années que je joue, ce sont toujours les mêmes. Faudrait penser à ajouter des vaches et cochons, plus je monte, plus il faut faire des trucs avec du lait, pour les cochons 3 h pour avoir de la viande! Faudrait agrandir le coin pèche, la ville aussi, et la réserve. Ça fait des mois que je n'arrive pas à finir un animal, faute de pouvoir avoir des puzzles, vous ne mettez jamais des bateaux avec puzzles les weekends, faudrait penser à ceux qui ne peuvent pas jouer la semaine (travail par exemple) par contre, je suis envahie de coupons qui ne servent plus à grand chose quand on a presque tt. Les voisins, en avarars, devraient pouvoir venir nous aider pour certaines tâches agricoles, accélération de certaines plantes ou arbres qui durent jusqu'à 6 h.
جميل جدا، موضوع الشاحنه يستفيدوا منه أصحاب آلاف المنتجات مو احنا الفقارى ههههه، ياليت تعملوا زياده لحليب البقر ولحم الخنزير ما يكفي 15 مثلا كل حيوان ينتج 2 او 3 حليب ولحم لانه صعب على هالحال ما عارفين نصنع منتجات البان ولا منتجات لحم كافيه
1:27 ohh thank you!!! 😍
Give me more diamonds 👻🎃
Night mode pliss
Wau 🔮🎩❤️
The sun comes up and then the moon comes out. Everything is better at night and the farm would look good when its dark. BRING OUT THE MOON
amazing ❤️
Mais um lacticínios.....
Vai ter tradução em outras línguas?
Chat features important  We want to chat individual with our friends so we can and they can help each other and ❤❤
Omg this is amazing thank you so much 🥺 I'd loooove to see rhinos in the sanctuary hopefully soon? 🙏
More farming space. The ability to trade or sell unused/unwanted decorations. That would be nice
Amazing
Dear developers!☀️💖Add a factory where we can produce compote!
I wish the production hours for crops and factories would decrease
Dear developers!☀️💖Add a factory where we can produce compote!
What about free coins buildings to expensive each time we need to sell everything so we can buy a new machine imagine only the ice cream machine was 31000 coins
Let’s gooooo
Please give us an undo or confirmation button when we cut trees accidentally 😢 bought trees are not as beautiful as the natural ones as they don't change colour with seasons.
How about a day/night mode? Or some actual weather conditions? Snow is the only one we get.  How about an update to the town? We’ve never had one. It’s getting boring there. And the fishing area could use a little change as well. Other than that….i still LOVE my Hay Day🐓
Will we ever get a paint brush for planting bushes, like we can use in edit mode?
Night mode pls
Bune biçim güncelleme lan ? insan balıkçı bölgesine guncelleme getiririr daha heyvanlı yapar atıyorum esya toplayıp olta yapma yaptığımız oltaların gücü felan olucak denizin dibindeki efsanevi balıkları filan avlıcaz illa benmi yapayım 😡
Okkk finally after years they make it easier to decorate our farm. But still we need u to remove tools purchase limit. Its so annoying. I cant wait days after days to upgrade my barn! Please do something about it
😍😍😍😍
có ai người Việt Nam không 🇻🇳
Gracias!! 😸
I love the game HayDay I have been playing it since 2014 And I loved her very much Please continue to amaze us and we are grateful to you, Your brother is from Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 Thanks everyone
Night mode please 🥺or else make the game 3D like Everdale....
เป็นเกมที่ชอบทีสุด
اضافة ايموجي مثل بروال استار و كلاش رويال
En español por favor
Muito bom muito bom ❤
Yerel fiyatlandırma istiyoruz Türkiyede farm pass 470 tl çok pahalı
Looks like some good changes, and QOL changes too which is great to see! Looking forward to the update!
Please, finally, do introduce a new shop: the Workshop for producing Boards and hammers and tools ... High Level haydayists will massively thank you for IT!!!! Please!!!
When will the update be please?
No puedo escanear el código QR. 😢. Que pasa, le tomé captura y nada. No se puede
We need a new storage building for the construction materials please. 😅
Omg i'm in love with the decorations ❤
خوش اضافات حلوه 😭🔥🔥😤
Per favore, taducete in ITALIANO? GRAZIE ❤
كم عربي هنا؟❤
❤
If possible. tom. Search for land upgrade items to b search. Atleast 3 numbers  per search it's very helpful for players.  Very difficult  to find this item's... Thank u . Giving us mind refreshing game.❤
You should do night mode
What do you think about opening more blueberry and avocado plants? Pleaseeeee
❤ love it ❤.
We desperately need more land/room in the sanctuary. Also we need an animal completed with puzzle pcs., before we start a new animal. And last, we need the requirements of deeds, scrolls and such to be lessened. I have been unable to clear all my farm land for several years. 55 to 70 deed and stake requirements is ridiculous.  Player for 12 years.
omg no more in Sanctuary, WHAT ABOUT EXPANDING OUR TOWN ?? has  been neglected all these years why?
ok this update is awesome for real
Nice, but when are we getting new decorations from Ads? We still have summer ones
Eine verbesserte Produktion für Heu und Stroh für die Tiere imReservoire wäre sehr angebracht! Im normalen Betrieb komme ich kaum dazu, Stroh herzustellen, weil das erstens zu lange dauert und zweitens so wenig Ernte einbringt.
I love the game but some options are so expensive and long. oh my god.😢
Yeni gelin👠💄👄✋💅👰💍
IM SUPER SUPER SUPER EXCITED FOR THESE THINGS 😍 i love halloween in hay day, my favorite season 🥰🎃🎃
So exited for boat event with new Halloween machine ❤
Night mode please please please,😞
Silo and barn fast full and for tol6ls for upgrade barn and silo, is difficult to get... And also my tickets  movie daily  not coming  again after dissappear  more than a years.
Teenage mutant ninja turtle the lessons that has already 🤬🤬🤬
Yeahhhhh it’s time I’m so excited ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
روعه
Love love love it , thank you 🇬🇧🇬🇧❤️❤️
I’m so used to getting my phone ready for the qr code… 😢😂😂
Exciting updates! Thanks for listening to your players.
En español por favor 🙏🏻
That one girl with an accent, is hard to understand at times.
Oh its finally halloween again. Last time i joined helloween event in hayday was 2019🤣
The garden time is too long on some items. Long hours..you will miss whatever task you have. I bought a special for 4.99 and it charged me 5.99. Why is that? To complete the catalog more ways to retreat the items is needed. Some you have to use diamonds to get. Put them on the truck as well or in the boxes. Although we know we won't get them. Just my opinion..thanks
THE BEST UPDATE EVER
Love a pig gost👻 Thank you for past years deco and for free tree,I needed it🥹But last year helloween deco were better
Wow It's a really cool game 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
But there is no night mode 😂😂
This makes me so happy and couldn't come at a better time. My 2 favorite games are this and Simpson's Tapped Out and after 11 years of playing they just decided to end the game. ThankYouHayDay👻🍁🍂🎃 I needed this❤
Postponing the development of the game to be more realistic, more effective and ideal, and there is a time for rain and a time for snow to fall, a time when it is night and sunset and sunrise, and we turn on the farm lights and there is more interest and facilitation of opening the land plots easier and fewer requests for beginners to be better and more enjoyable and have enthusiasm to complete the game, and thank you for updating it and we always look forward to the best and good luck to your follower from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia❤🇸🇦
It's a very good game I advise everyone to download it🫶🏻💗
Night mode please🥺🫶🏻
night mod please
THANK YOU for this wonderful deco ❤ I love Halloween 🎉🎃🦇🕷️👻
Night mode pliss
I would REALLY like to have more land in the town and on the beach.
Open sell dicoration btween players
Please I lost My farm  7 years ago  with Huracán María I Made a new one when  My daugther gave me new phone i Lost they 2nd  one  Estancias de Madrigal   I don't habe the farm number please help me if you can

Please add night mode🙏
❤❤
Halloween in Hay Day is the best period of the year!
Multiple truck orders and new editing mode features are best part! Great update! ❣️🤍💚🩵
Keep going I love this update!
نتمنى لكم هالووين مخيفا 🤣🎃🎃👻
عجلة الحظ اليومية يجب ان تحتوي على هداية ثمينة وليس على اشياء رخيصة مثل القمح وغيرها من هداية اخرة لا قيمة لها نحن نريد ان تكون هاي دي الاولى على مستوى العالم اظافة بعض التعديلات على الوادي  تكون اعداد النقاط كبيرة والسيارة لا تعطل  التقليل من وقت بعض المنتجات هناك اوقات مبالغ بها هية بتالي لعبة لتسلية والمنافسة وليس لي حرق الاعصاب ارجو الاستفادة من بعض النصائح يا مجموعة هاي دي
The sanctuary should've been on the other side of the river on the main farm, let's be honest, great idea but no-one feeds them it's too out the way to enjoy
رجاااااأ لاتحدثو المزرعة هاي داي لان المزرعة تصبح ثقيلة جدا جدا لان مزرعتي الكبيرة لم تعد تفتح من التحديثات هاي داي وشكرا لتفهمكم 😢
Night mode😢
😁
Pleasse bring us free chick decos for us astleasst give us a old one
Why is the game majorly focused on decorations? It's always about 99% decorations and barely 1% about farming.
2:46 here is the Qr code 🧙🏻‍♀️
Ok this mite just be one of the best updates they are changing edit mode 🤩🤩🤩🎉🎉
Mode nuit svp sa serait très agréable
Thank you for the QOL changes! Next? Opening Town and Sanctuary land space and a new Town building? 😊
AYA BATERIAA!!🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
Let's go Halloween 🎃 let's get Hay Day started 😎
Se ve genial esta Actualización de Halloween. Me gustannlos cambios y las decoraciónes. ¡¡FELIZ HALLOWEEN!!. 🎃👻
Pleeeeeeaase new design on houses....... i'm so sick of the same ones every time
The update is nice, but I hope to add night mode to the farm 🌌🥺
Night mode please
😻😻😻😻😻
We need night mode 😢
Yes finally the truck ! Thank you for make it like that , cuz i hate waiting the truck to complete another task 😂
scenic mode YESSS
Estaremos en primera fila
Wow!  The new improvements sound fantastic!  I'm also looking forward to the Halloween decos; I've only spent 6 diamonds in the past year because I wanted to be sure I had enough to spookify my farm.  Love the free deco, too, thank you :-)
THANKS FOR THE FREE DECO PIECE I LOVE IT !
Hay day for ever till dieeee
Add Helicopter Cargo Service if you HAY DAY) wants to copy of edit mode like CLASH OF CLANS then why not Helicopter Cargo Service like game TOWNSHIP so don't hrsitate and launch AIR CARGO SRRVICE in HAY DAY to make much interesting too..
Nice 👍
Less time on production…… and building and boat arrivals that would be a mega great deal and upgrade
2:46 🎁🎁🎁
Night mode and Avocado Tree please.
عاشت أيدكم والله 😂🙂
Amazing, I love it 🥰
Please add night mode 😭
Night mode pls

Please give us saw and axe unlimited for all time 🙏🙏
드디어!!! 신규모드들 너무 기다렸던 것들이에요!! 할로윈 장식도 너무 기대되구요!
This is the moment we've been waiting for!
Yıllardır gece modu istiyoruz 2 dakika gece 2 dakika gündüz değişimi zaman akışı çok iyi yakışır bu oyuna neden oyuncuları dinlemiyorsunuz
The truck update would bde awesome
I love you 😙💕💕
❤️🔥
e cadê espaço para tudo isso.? minha fazenda e cidade esta tao lotada q nao cabe mais nada
We need our own avater/Character in hay day....Also need a night mood....❤❤❤Agree guys??? 👇
Ok nice update and nice animals as always but the sistem for unlock them are too slow..seriously, you have to improve something especially now with this amount of animals in the sanctuary 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Night mode pleasesssssss
Thank you so much ❤
Night mode
This update i like!! THANK YOU ❤️
Esto es genial, son actualizaciones muy grandes pero funcionales y se agradecen ❤
❤🎉❤😂😮😂❤🎉🎉
Лучше бы территорию пляжа расширили!!! Зачем неактивная часть?!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
cant wait...
please put Xp booster and tom short naps on the store more often. i'm waiting months to buy those boosters.
Шановні розробники прошу Вас додати українську мову в гру, оскільки багато українців грає в hay day
Non riesco a ritirare la decorazione, aiuto
Absolutely HORRIBLE! The heavy, unnecessary DECORATIONS push is just a major turn-off. These stupid TASK EVENTS and limited production machines are just ridiculous. I think it's time to say GOODBYE. It is no longer a farming simulation. It's a decoration game. Zero new items. Zero fishing area enhancements. The utterly pointless Chicken valley... Jeez. Unbelievable. An absolute failure of an update.
Night mode pls
Night mode please  I dont care about decorations
I love Hayday.. n I love you guys! ❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘😘
Release New Valley Season Plz
Everything is perfect! I'm so happy with everything, I'm so excited for this spooky season! Thank you thank you thank you ❤🎉
please bring hay day to google play PC so that i can play it freely on mobile and PC
Omg i am loving it 😍❤
You should make a change where if you put up items in the roadshop accidentally, using the 1 diamond to trash the listing actually gives back the items, not deletes them. I put up 10 markers yesterday, trashed them and it was gone 😢
we want a new production building
Omg this has to be the most creative Halloween in Hay Day! Thank you guys! Cannot wait for all the spooky fun. 👻 🦇 🎃
Sou do Brasil só sei português ❤❤
give many expansion permits or be able to buy.
После последнего осеннего обновления исчезли билеты в кинотеатр и конверт с заданиями. Уважаемые разработчики прошу вас  исправить эту ошибку,  уже год как вы ничего не исправляете, большой вам минус за это.
So cool
I have a question if I buy the following farm pass(59.99 ) will I have it the next time another one appears? or will I have to buy it again next time?
it would be perfect if we could store the animals we no longer need
Good❤
The easy paint brush system sounds brilliant I like to change up large areas for different calendar events and it takes so long.  Can you please make existing decorations more accessible like paving and fencing, you need a lot of these not just 2 or 3 given at random. ive been playing for years and still can't implement ideas as there is no option to purchase them (real or game cash) I'm patient but even I give up after a year of waiting for items to possibly become available... Would love some black or very dark paving, I only see brown wooden Thanks for all your efforts! Love 💕, love 💗, love 💕
Please do night mode 🖤🖤🖤
🎉❤
it would be perfect if we could store the animals we no longer need! can you pls add more baby animals and more types of flowers  for the bees so we can choose which kind of flowers we want to use
The helping feature should really improve! meaning the trees ifyou are farming them alot this is really a lot of work, also a night mode would be so awesome 🫶🏼
Wow
Finally a good update👀 definitely motivates to work on the decorating!
El modo nocturno sería genial
اجمل لعبه على الاطلاق
Halloween would be epic with a night mode with lanterns, street lights and some decoration bulbs. Please make it happen ❤
This update is AMAZING
Omg love the scenic mode . I was getting so frustrated
Puzzle pieces do ghanta bhar or animal add krte rho bs
Ostrich please 😢😢😢
Can't wait
I play for my momy phone
មានខ្មែរអត់
Will we get a chance to get the dancing sheep again?
уменя проблема с пазлами в городе я кидал скрин тех поддержку но нечего нету 😭😭😭
Night mode, please 😢
Waiting for new update
NEW ANIMAL YIPEEEE
I just want the halloween themee music
Combining different fences and paths would be helpful. Some of them are useless for me separately!
We need more animals to buy with our chic passes!!!!!!
Please add night mode
Return the loophole game products without boring loophole
❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ I love the New ideas and improvements ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ---------- ❤ ----- Thank you to the Hay Day team ----- ❤ ---------- ❤ Maybe next time improvement in the fishing area or in the town.  I miss Challenges in the town and possibilities to upgrade again.
Imagine if was night during the Halloween season😢
Wann kommt das Update?
Hallo 🤗🥰 я играю уже 10лет, хотелось бы что бы эта игра не когда не наскучила 😢пожалуйста не большая просьба, сделайте ночной режим!!! 🤗 Тем более сейчас такой повад хеллоуин 😍💕
Night mode
I love the thing with the eraser! And the BRUSH!!
You're a great team.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻The "undo"button was the thing most I wanted.I wish "the Sims" by EA games had a successful software team like you.
Aghhh this is what i need for a long time, the undo and eraser button. Thank you hayday for always upgrade the game quality
Better not even
احنه عرب نلعب هايدى ممكن ترجمو المقاطع ❤❤ اني احب هايدى

So excited about the update - great job, guys!! ❤
😅Is there a girl here?
I haven't been sending it on the ship for a long time, I'll start sending it along with the events😃
Il faudrait surtout que le jeu revienne  sur de bonne base. Car depuis quelque temps une catastrophe dans le journal des ventes , et j’en passe. Le jeu deviendrait plus un jeu d’achats de diamants à tous va. À suivre.  🤨🤨🤨
I'm soo excited
Y para cuándo máquinas nuevas de producción y nuevos productos?
We need more land in the town and sanctuary.
أنا كان عندى مزرعه قديمه بإسم  Shams El _shmoos
Çok güzel yapmışsınız tebrik ediyorum ❤ Hay Day kendini geliştiren bir uygulama çok seviyorum🌺🌸💘
السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته كيف حالكم❤❤❤❤
THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!!! I love decorating but edit mode was always a pain! Can't wait for the update!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
PLEASE GOVE US AN EXTRA DAIRY MACHINE AND A SEAPARATE STORAGE FOR SILO AND BARN ITEMS

Can we get a meaningful content update for once instead of MORE DECOS?? PLS?!!!?
The new edit mode is so great for me. I love decorating the farmm🎉🎉🎉

Something new for get more coins plsss. The more you get higher lvl the more expensive to get the machine😢 AND YESS CANT WAIT TO HALLOWEEN SEASON!!👻
I want too see this! deco claimed!
The truck is great, it is now very easy to send a truck to level up.
Lo único q se q en el puesto de ventas hay personas q no dejan nada tendrían q preocuparse por poner sucion a eso
Well, it would be nice if you could activate dark mode, it would be great for Halloween.
HAYDAYYY
Love Sadako well, very Japanese❤
Tambahkan fitur untuk bisa lihat siapa teman main kita  yang sedang on line dalam satu lingkungan. Supaya mainya jadi lebih seru karena tau siapa saja teman yang sedang online/ bermain
Apart from decoration hay day haven't added anything else they are not thinking about barn and silo nor fishing area train area hay day is getting boring hay day era will be end soon if they will not do anything interesting 😅😅
Tutto bello, ma dovete fare sbloccare i terreni più rapidamente e gratis, se no dove le metto tutte ste decorazioni???
Azərbaycanlılar varr❤
❤
Deberian modernizar el juego, adaptar el diseño del pase de la granja de acuerdo a la temática de temporada, al igual que la pantalla de carga, es la misma desde hace añosssss, tienen que actualizarse
نريد حل لاسترجع المزارع المفقودة لا نستطيع استرجاع تقدمنا  في اللعبة مما يهبط عزيمتنا في اللعبة
I LOVE YOU❤
Спасибо!!!
I hate the temporary machines, it's a con to get u to spend money on opening the extra slots,, waste of money
We need more land in the sentchuery  as well as farm area and please remove expand permission
Hello admin and hard-working farmers! I am Vietnamese. I have played hay day game for many years. I wish the game could update the day and night function and will have more light and moonlight effects when night comes. Thank you for reading and understanding. My game ID: #9R899GVRJ let's be friends.
I love it!!😍😍❤️❤️
We want to change the decorations of the newspaper
نريد عربي يشرحنلة شنو الي حدثوه بوضع التعديل
‏‪0:18‬‏ انا هون مين معي
Halloween is boring. 🥱
I suggest to you a modification, which is to send us a notification when someone sends a message from the neighborhood Because sometimes someone is in immediate need of help, but we don't know until we open the game  ￼
Semakin  seru dn keren
So excited. Thank you Hay Day❤🐰🥰❤️
Gece modu lütfen
秋の飾り物を、買いました。ダイヤで同じ物ばかり当たり、破産しました。ハロウィンなんて、楽しめなくなりました。
Bring back crows

Plz hay day developer youtube add with hindi language 😢
Kindly provide more for increasing the space for silo or barn
We want to bring back Supercell like before please
Ich würde es toll finden generell die verschiedenen Gegenstände aus den anderen Büchern einfacher freizuschalten und mehr viel mehr puzzle Stücke für die Tiere in der Stadt. Das geht ewig. Sonst alles super. Halloween ist die coolste Saison
