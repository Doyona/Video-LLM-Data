Andaleebs character is extremely selfish. She was madly in love with her college boyfriend, and tried to commit suicide for him. Then her love changed instantly when she realised he didnt do same for her. Then numair supported her in everything, one time she finds out hes doing a DNA test she leaves him and her daughter. Shes acting like shes all mature and can be independent like her friend zara, but infact she is a foolish spoilt brat! Best character in this drama was zara.
This girl is still immature. The person who helped her in her worst times and always stood by her side even when she was at wrong. Now when he made a mistake she is forgetting everything and being selfish again.
Kiya Hasan ko drama se nikal diyaa😂😂😂😂😂
Anadil is so cute ❤❤
❤❤❤😮
Itna mushkil ho gaya hai is mamhos drame ko dekhna uffff itna afsos ho raha hai itni episodes dekh li ab chor b nai skti uffffffff
All the problem is andaleep is stuck with the thought that her every action and decision has been planned by other thats why she doesn’t wants to go to him again she thinks its her decision to take divorce which doesn’t match with her parents..
Hassan ke haters attendance lageae😅😅😂😂
Bakwas, Andleeb should've remembered that she has a doubt able past, still she is overreacting. At that time Numair didn't care about anyone and now she is portraying like satti sawitri
Ohoooo tooo toxic
Andaleeb is wrong
AUDIENCE be like 😂 Na dekh sakte hein; Na chor sakte hein 😅
🌀🌀
Numair is basit 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love how people are fighting about andaleeb’s immaturity 🤣 guys it’s the script writers fault chill 🥲
Jb zara ko munh khol k baat batani chahiye andaleeb ko tb bolti nhi hai or jb chup rehna chahiye tb sb bol degi🙃🙃🙃🙃

Andleeb ki izat air waqar us waqt kahan tha jb pehly hi din shadi ke suicide ki thi.. Jb apny ghar walon ne zabardasti numair ke sath bej diya tha.. Numair supported her when she was in need..
Uffff Dr Sameer Eyes❤❤❤

Andaleeb Kuch Ziyada Hi Uchalll Rahi Hai... Or Mohib Mirza Or Dadi Ko To Dramy Sy Hi Nikaal Diyya hai 😅😅
Real parents are like Andleeb parents not like zara😂

Dusre drama mein sab log kahate Hain ki season 2 kab aaega kab aaega : aur iss drama season 2  kabhi bhi na Aaye season 2 kabhi bhi na Aaye main to yahi kahunga..... Baki tumhari marzi 💢
I hate andleep 😒😒sara qasur khud ka elzam numair py wah👏🙄🙄
Overreact 😒😒😒
Oh wait he came up to apologize and gently coax her into going back with him. He started off with getting mad at her.   Showed no remorse for his behavior.   This Andaleep woman has proven to be extremely irrational and weak character throughout.   Almost everyone other than the central characters make sense.
Dumb ass writing. This was painful already now it’s turned exceptionally stupid.   Also why is every woman wanting khula and where is their right of divorce.
Ye kitni zeher lagti hai andaleeb.  Aisi aurten toxic he hoti hein jo apna gahr kharab karti hein aur dusron ko bhi wohi mashware deti hein
Ik galat fehmi ki waja se ye gril ye Kar rahi he os ne DNA ki liy karwaya or adlep kea samji Sai Kaha he gril ki aqal gutno me hoti he 😅
Ye seriaeal dekha ke kea dekhana he Dunia ko اللہ muaf farmay hidayat de gril ko
Ajeeb pagal character andleeb . Zehar lg rahi
stuiped debu, agr yahi kuch krna tha to etna drama rechany ki kia zarorat thi,
Dupatty ka to rivaj he ni rha
Kuch paise kya dekh liya dimag kharap ho gaya is ladki ka😅😅
Andleeb KO sharm nhi ati numair KO Bura kehty hoye.jb wo ghr SE bhagi JB wedding night KO suicide ki numair NY har tarha sath dia.warna asi larkion KO pochta kon hai.ab numair ki ghlti maaf nhi ho rhi
Has anyone told Andaleep that Umair reacted to something he was mentally shocked with.  I think my husband would have gone for genetic test.   My only disappointment would be if my husband doesn't communicate with me as to why?  If my husband tells me he is shocked and it is not your character but it's more to help me understand how real is this situation of a pregnancy is, I would have understood.
Andaleeb is doing wrong, She has forgotten what Numair has done for her, even knowing everything about her relation with Moiz the wedding night she commit suicide despite this all Numair supports Andaleeb…even no one literally no one does this all what Numair did with Andaleeb
Totally rubbish.. kya sochkr bnaya y drama.. 😡 time waste ..
She forgot everything what he did for her unbelievable
Yeh rishta kia kehlata ha  Naira Kartik in Pakistani version 😂
Bakwas starplus drama
Andaleep is over reacting She's not mature Acha khasa darama kharab krdiye..
Mje smj nhi ata numair ko kab pata chala wo zinda hai.. Kya koi bata sakta hai
Is bat pay bohat ghusa ata hai kay pori bat q nhi bata tay jo numair ki hai
Paise kmane lgg gyi h na...iska ye behavior Acha hi nhi lgg rha is pr
Is ladki ne apni galtiyan nhi dekhi..bhool gyi apni galtiyan
Andlib ne as episode me numer se asha nahi Kya yaar 😢 our as  episode me mujhe balkul pasand nahi aai
👍❤❤️
It is better for makers to end this drama as soon as possible 😂
I really wish this dayen andaleeb should get divorce from Numair and run away with moiz. Thats what she deserves 😂
Dagho daghi character wali lrki ko us bnde ne accept kiya izzat di. Aur is bibi k tauntrum dekho. Bhonga script. Always gives me high blood pressure
Fazul dimagh ki dahee. Khud ye andaleeb 900 choohe kha k bhi us lrke ne open arms k sath ise izzat di pyar diya aur yeh ek chez k peche leenj bn k bethi ha ehsan framosh. And pakistani dramas are normalising it so easily. Shitfy
What the hell yaar. So sad to see audience supports such characters like andaleeb and drama is normalising such acts. Which mother on earth can leave her newborn baby like that ? Bullshit
Plssss numair and andaleeb's happy ending pleaseeeeeee😭💔
Brooooooo i m literally crying andaleeb and numair should be together ughh i will also dieee😭😭 oh goddddd myh tearssss😭😭💔
moiz ko chhod  diya tha ab numair ki baari
Andaleef ess drama mai sub se. Barhee tension hai start se lekar end tak . Intehayee bewaqoof larhkii hai
I think andaleeb has a point it’s not about the day of dna test its about 9 months of her pregnancy when numair was on dwelling about her loyalty just imagine what he would’ve cheated on her ??? It’s totally possible when there’s no trust on loyalty in a relationship the both parties are already on different tracks nobody is bound to nobody and then where does it lead to ?? Cheat … the fear the insecurity the determination of having a divorce didn’t come on a day it came with 9 month when she was pregnant with her husbands child she found a reason those neglected moments those difficult time alone in her pregnancy she went through alone when she was madly in love with him … 🙂
Nope Andaline is literally a pagli
Thank God writer dont make friends lovers
Andleeb is very selfish, he also cheated on Numair, when he made a mistake he got such a big punishment..... 😒
Zara is only one mature in the entire drama 😂
kya andeep ko bacchi ki chinta nahi hi
Andleeb ko ab yaad aa raha hai ki waqar aur izzat kya hai???jab muiz ke saath ghoom rahi thi,chhat pe mil rahi thi,,tab usko apne parents ki ijjat aur Waqar ka hosh nahi tha....aur shaadi ki raat suiside kar ke numair aur uski family ki ijjat aur waqar ka dhyan nahi aaya,,, numair ne uski saari galtii, tantrums us time sahe jab uske maa baap bhi usko rakhna nahi chahte the...phir wo bina baat kare ,koi safai sune bina beti ko chhod kar chali gayi tab wi maa baap ke ghar bhi jaa sakti thi.....abbhi numair aur uski family usko accept kar rahi hai...phir bhi uski jahalat aur nakhre hi khatam nahi ho rahe... what a foolish lead character 😮
PIA  Dallas kab jati hai
Ye ladki kitne jaldi move on kr leti hai yaar 😂😂
Ye ladki Abhi bhi nhi sudhar Rahi hai 😅😅
Bhote chochla wala drama ha mein to mawra ke liye dekh rahi  hu ya drama lakin is drame ki andaleep Or zara chota sa masla mein atna natak hota ha har riste me ladai Or ya sab jo ladai dekhi ha meine woh to kuch nhi ha thik ho sakta ha atna kya natak karna yaar andaleep ko 😅
One thing I didn’t get in this drama that Zara is high qualified dr. and she didn’t realise on first place that Hasan had mental health issues and when he treated her badly first time why she didn’t got a clue
Hasan is much better than numair and andaleeb where is he i miss him ❤❤❤
What a shit story. Deebu’s tantrums are so baseless. He was wrong not to tell her the truth, but accusing him for not trusting her, like seriously. Wasn’t he the first person who trusted her in the beginning.
Mujhe ye dekh k ptani q kartik or naira ki story yaad aa gyi ptani kis kis ne dekha hoga " ye rishta kya kehlata hai serial wo ek indian  🇮🇳 serial ki story thi Kartik ne bhi naira par shak kiya tha to naira sab chod k chali gyi thi or kuch saalo baad asa hi wapas aa gyi thi.
Enough  andleep
❤❤❤❤
i love Undleebe❤❤❤❤
Wtf adaleeb
Waise to andaleep ki acting bht cute lgti h par iss drame me kuchh zara jyada hi over act krdiya....kaun kaun sahemat h like kre
Khud galti karo toh mafi ki umeed karte hai dusra kray toh Saja ki
Andleep k parents usko ye kyon nhi batate ki uske report m aya ki vo baap nhi bun skta
Mzbot ort 😂😂😂😂
Why am I still watching this torture ?🥶🤢🤢🤢 Only thing missing here is the background music “ dhena dhena dhum tananana dhena dhena dhena “
Oww Andalip koun si izzat our waqar ki baat karti ho shadi sai pehle khud ko aine mai dekha tha khud kitni awara thi🤪😏🤨
Inhi log ki wajah se mashra badnam hai
Abe har cheez ka itna over kyun dikha rha hai
Kaun director hai iska
Soru
What does anadil means?
Andaleeb ko numair ki baat sunna orr samjhna chahiye tha 😡😡 jabki numair ko moise ke bare me sab pta tha fir bhi numair ne suna orr samjha 😢😭
Larki hoti hi esi hai apni marzi ke halat me mohobat karti hai
Bro ngl but numair dna test kra leta 🤦 And yaar tbh being a doctor he didn't think about exceptions and the one's who are saying ki zara and andleeb are different yaar deebu i not very mature Kyunki dhe saw everything really fast in life and tbh what she did was fine kyunki usne boht saha hai aur ek time ke baad insaan phir sirf apne baare mein sochne lagta hai jisme uski bhi galti nhi hoti And tbh jitna bhi kuch ho you must never blame a women on her character and that too when she loved you a lot 😔  Deebu left moiz kyunki she realised ki goliyaan khane se pyaar ka parmaan nhi diya jaata 😢aur jo aapko kahe ki mere liye maro id think he she love u😢
Hi
Hi
Anadil so cute ❤
She is over active 😅
2025🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Deebuuuuuuuuuuuu..............................................
Andleeb is such a drama..... She left her home for 2 years without telling anyone and now acting like she is a legend..... In reality parents asim larkiyon ko accept hi nhi krtay
If Andaleep is as brave, nature and confident as she says she is, get a divorce first, instead of trying to fix her cousin with her husband.

Numair is not men😂😂
I love zaraa❤
Fir bache ka baap kon h😂😂😂😂
Andaleep should understand the situtations and forgive numair, as she has also made mistake in the beginning and numair was her greatest supporter😅
اور عندلیب نے جو ماں باپ کی عزت خاک میں ملائی،وہ اسکو نظر نہی آتا
Who is watching this in2x speed😂😂
Andaleeb kuch zyada hi natak kar rhi ha😡😡
Now andaleeb is doing wrong.....she  is saying about her izzat where was her self respect that time"jab wo ghr se bhag rahi thi "???
30:15 enshan ager pahle apna girebaan main jhakta to mashala hi kya tha.. Mumma kahti hai Inshan ko first apna kapda cheak Karna chahiye ganda hai kharab   fir dushre par jhakee  .. Like Andaleep pe SHUTEBAL hai
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Andaleep is the worst choice for numair
Andaleep and her family is so selfish and rude
Mene banaya try kiya to pura chipak Gaya pen me
*This Series ShOws That Even thOugh HOw Much Uh CLaim Uh LOve SumOne, They'LL ALways DOuBt Uh, NO Matter What the SituatiOn...*
*Hassan &W Numair's Character Are twO sides Of theW Same COin Of Our SOciety.. If Hassan hit ZaRa PhysicaLLy.. Numair did the Same MentaLLy With AndaLeeB!!!!!*
*WOw Incredible PerfOrmances By ALL theW Characters.. But, Numair in the Last Few Minutes Just StOLe the ShOw, ExceLLent QuaLity Of Acting...!!!!!*
I just hate andaleeep 😢😢
Story was good,but how it is shown is not perfect.
Now this drama is totally bakwass
2×× wale hazri lagao....bakwas drama...bakwas ending
"A friend in need is a friend indeed" Zara is not a good friend. She didn’t help her friend....
Deebus attitude is getting unbearable.
Andleeb gone mad and I am not understanding that why they are dragging it just end it
The independent woman deebu so much differ from the independent man numair... Both made mistakes one got love and the other hate!
Bechara numair💔😭
andleepb ji tum bhot cute  ho    i love  you ji 😜😜
Vote for session 2 😔🥺😭
Skip skip karke rakhne wale attendance lagao 😂🤣😂🤣😂
𝖠𝗇𝖽𝖺𝗋𝖾𝗉 𝗉𝖺𝗀𝖺𝗅
I don't understand people in comments,i mean in some previous episodes people were saying: "Andaleep should never forgive numair" "He should trust him"  And now they are like: "Andaleep is overreacting"  "Andaleep should forgive him now" I mean can't you guys stay at one side??🤷‍♀️🤦‍♂️
Andaleeb apna past bhul rhi hai yha voh galat hai aur koi usse numair kee sacchai bhi Nahi bata rha irritate kar rhi hai ab yee
Chat pe larky se mil skti he, shadi ki rat khudkushi krskti he, is condition me b Numair ne usko support kiya. Bad me parhaya bhi, sb kch kiya. Jab uski aik weekness ne shak me mubtila krdia to iski itni barii saza. Numair ko to bilkul hi drame ka villan sabit krdia hai. Hadd haii !!
Whos noticed NFAK's painting on wall
Andleeb ke jane ke time numair ne itni gandi acting ki ki director sahab ne uske aane ke time numair ke expressions hi nahi dikhaye seedha parents ke sath conversation dikha di.😂
Hi❤❤❤
Andaleeb needs to shut the hell up about the things she had to go through because it's repetitive and boring and selfish and honestly, lame. It's like all she needed in life was to become independent and move on from numair as soon as she could which is what she has done.
Actually Andaleeb doesn't deserve Numair he is a pure soul kind hearted person he deserves Zara not Deebu
Kon 2025 me dekh raha hai 😂😂
Zyada laad pyar bhi bachy ko bighar deta hai. Jese k andleeb jab dil krta hai munh utha k nikal jati hai na maa baap ko btati hai na shohar ko btati hai. Like seriously
Plzzz aap log ab kisi ki gltiyan notice naa krna
I like ket drama
I hate andleeb
Debooo, ab bs b kardo, salloooon pr jawo😂😂
Asa to nh hota real ma bar bar gr chor kr chly jaho
Chloo last episode dekh kr jan churaen
Hasan who has anger issues was supposed to be patient but the girl who left home on any thing got sympathies and no one is taking about her mental health issues. Only guys labelled so easily.
Watching on 2x
Bahut nataq Kar rahi h ab andalip 🥴🥴😵😵
Lat episode ka intejar h ab to jaldi Khatam ho ye shhow
koi husband agr waqi infertile ho aur vo dna kerwa le it is not a big issue at all........is baat ko galat kion bataya jaraha hai.....ab education ya broadmindedness kidar gya......infertile ho aur aulad ki khushi miljai ye baat itni normal nai.....
There is no love in this world
Hiw pathetic, Numair supported her when she was a total mess.  When it come to his turn, she left him and her child.  What bloody rubbish!!
The last few episode's have been a total disaster.  The story writter and director have made such a big blunder on Deebo and Numairs relationship.  It started off really good but ended up a total mess!
Koi btayga khula jo undilip le rhi uska kya mtlb hota hai Urdu hai smjh ni aai kuch
12:18 numuar is so so sensible
I hate andleep character how spoil child
What the mean of khula lena ?
Pehle tow mai screen bari kar k dekh rahi thi phir mujhe drama bore lagnay laga tow mainay comments open karliey dramay say ziada entertainment comment section may hai😂
Good Ap ne theek bola❤
Ab ye drama bore kr rha h bss pehle jaisa mja nhi rha iss me 😢
❤
Andleeb jaise aulaad insan kisi dushman ko b na dy
Zara deebu ko sab sach btaa kr smjha kr b to ja sakti thi na k numair ne sab kyun kia tha
Her video k nichy sirf esi bndi ka comment hota ha
Bht hi bakwas serial bnaya h ksm se
Numair gained more weight towards the end of the show
Season 2 season 2 bhiiii fata fat 🌚🤣
Please guys numair ka dressing sense koi upgrade kro yarr🥺🙏
When she did mle and got match all of a sudden 🤪
Now andleeb is so annoying 😠
Despite of having doubts, numair was still good with andleeb. His doubts are natural and genuine.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hii
Andaleeb is very unfits character From the beginning who agrees? Such a immature character

Andalip is a spoiled brat and really doesn’t deserve the love of such a good person like humair    The child should be left with humair.
Andleeb kai parents ko uspei barosa nhi phr dekhi woh numar ko kya bol rehe hai
❤ ❤❤ ❤❤❤
20:35  ijjat ki baat kon kar rahi hai🙂👍🏻 ek galti kya kardi bas iska drama shuru🙂🦶🏻
17:01 majbot orat😂
16:00 she is overacting 🫠 she just forgot how numair support her in first 🫠
Numair ny itny mushkil time ma Deebu ko support kiya but usky 7 jo problem ti wo Deebu k 7 share krta na k choori chupy DNA Krwaany ponch jata
Is episode may comment bohat mazy mazy ky ha
💔🥺 Kamaaal dramaa 🥺💔
Flop
Andleeb k nakhry hi khatm ni ho rhy
I didn't like the charector of andaleeb. Very stubborn .forgot what she has done on her marriage day and how nomair supported her.
Nice drama me to rat 8bjy sy shoro hoa hon k aj 9:05am ho gay kam ph b nh gaya choti kr li
Andaleeb please remember that time when dr numair support you. And give you love and respect.
End pay a kar fazul ho gaya ha drama
Real name of Dr. Sameer?
Idhr mene drama play kia hua hy idhr comments enjying
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Wah Zara k maze hain itna handsome doctor mil hi gaya😅
Andleeb hmsha hi wrong direction pe thi numair ki jga koe b hta to usy Chor dta medical report k bd ye sb
Hum tv dramas ka berah ghark kr raha hai shro mai ache or bad mai ajeeb mor
Mojhy toh numeer ko dekh krr rona ajata ha Kash koi deboo ko btade numeer ki sachai
زارا نے عندلیب کو بتایا کیوں نہیں
Itnaa fazool drama kaise ban sakta he
This andaleeb was always that troublemaker....numair held onto her when the world thought shes characterless. He could forgive her. She cant. She ran away by choice. Putting her child and parents and in laws into misery. Shes always behaved like a brat. Yet shes acting like a victim here. She has the sole license to get away with shitty behaviour. But she wont cut someone else that slack. Plz. This girl is toxic.
andaleeb jis izzat o waqar ka rona ro rahi hai, wo izzat o waqar tab kahan gaya tha jab shadi ki pehli raat boyfriend k lye goliyan kha li theen aur numair ne khulay dil se usay maaf kiya tha
Ye andleeb puri pgl h 😂
I think andaleeb ki yadash chalegy islia o bhull gay ki usne past me kya Kiya thaaa😅😅😅😅
G ha
Only
Andaleeb's illiterate parents ruined her life in every aspect. Did her forced marriage.Didnt let her complete her education. Didnt give time and chance to moeez.On the other hand Zara's parents made her educated and independent and stood by her. So happy for zara now❤
Please bring season 2 with same character
Deepu jesi larki ko banda 2 chapair lagae or apnay haal per chorde. Aisay log ka victim mindset sabki zindagi ko aziat bana deta hai
23:23 Bachhi ka acting mast hai. Bhai ek dam point hai acting me.❤
Zara is the only perfect charater
Zberdast acting of usman mukhtar very good and nice man
Loose character andaleeb bakwas
Drama se Kya bna dia bakwass
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Andaleep ki soch bekaar hai
Instead of hassan andaleeb should have a tag of mental patient.. She had been always a difficult daughter difficult wife nd now difficult mom..
31:44  uss shaks ki nafrat bohot dukh deti hai jis se hum mohabbat krte hai ❤‍🩹🥺
Andaleeb is definitely don't care about her child because she didn't visit once to her child... she's just thinking about herself.... the most immature character
Deebu aisy krrhi jesy bari baa kirdarr rhi hay😂😂😂
Andaleeb is alive for them suddenly, and they're just so normal like....
❤❤❤❤
Andleeb itna over react kr ri ha numair ny bhe us ke ghalti maaf ke thi or us ka sath bhe dea tha and andleeb asay act kr ri ha k wo bilkul perfect ha 😂
what a stupid drama...what woman disappears leaving her daughter and parents and starts a new life somewhere?
Zara badi hi selfish h. Jab zara ko pta h kis wajah se andaleeb ghar q chhodi thi. Av andaleeb ko sachai bata de to sab thik ho jayega undono ki life
Andleeb Numair k sath boht ghlt kr rhi hy, aik number ki ahsaan framos, by zamirii hy, Too much overacting
Dramy bazz debu apni ghalti is ko yaad ni jab numair ny is ko support kia tha
Bht over horhi ha deboo
Ptta nahi kab last episode ai ga....!
Dr zara ka car driver humary village ka .lala Real name M. murtaz
Bor story
Zara is the only sensible person in this drama 🙌
Kiya bkwas drama  h itñey piyare doctor k Sath lmbo Pagal lga diya or itñey suljhy hoe doctor k Sath chachori Pagal lga de to drama itna bura to hona tha
Andaleeb zahar lag rahi hai😅
Shuru shuru mein thik tha mgr ab to yeh bakwass ho ja rha hein 😅
Andaleeb zyda hi overacting kr rhi h 😅😅 sb bhul gyi jo numair ne itta support kiya tha🤨😏😏
Comment section is more interesting than drama 😂😂
عندلیب is not fair with numair
Ajeb disgusting behavior hy andaleb ka khud shadi k din suicide kia bad m b masly krti rahe he supports her or apni bar ek ghalti uski maaf nh kr rhe isne tw mazk bnaya hua life ko
❤
16:35 this is how a woman hurt in love. Because woman made with emotions so treat her like a gentle man ☺️
33:20
Mujhe numair ka ghar iqtidar  me shahnawaz ke ghar ki trah lag raha hai😅
Zaafa serial bahot accha hai
I almost watched this episode by skipping
Deepo is right 😢
نمیر ایک بھاگی ہوئی لڑکی کو معاف کر دے رہا ہے یہ اسکا ظرف ہے پتہ نہیں عندلیب کو کس بات کی اکڑ ہے جبکہ عندلیب جیسی لڑکیوں کو معاشرہ کبھی معاف نہیں کرتا
Mene 2 episode Miss kar diya tha😬
Mein US ja rahi ho specialize karnay ; Oh bhai, US sey specialize karnay kay liye pehlay USMLE exam pass karna hota hay, then if you accepted for a residency program then you can go and join. Aisay mun utha kay chalay jaaney sey specialization nahi hoti. Hum TV writers and directors, please do your home work before shooting a drama.
17:05 behaya or badehsas orat zror hoti hai😮
Jb zroort th Anadil ko maa ki tb maa ki akad th
Or inhon ne wo part nhi dikhaya jb Numair ko deebu k zinda hone ka pta chla
Gussa aa rha deebu pe qasmay
andaleep kuch zyada over react kar rahi ha
Isi liye itne din bd drama dekha k boring
Numair ko smjh nhi rha koi
Boring ho rhe sb k character
Illogical character andaleeb
Andalip zinda hai ye sun ke numair ka reaction kaisa tha bataya he nhi
kis ne kaha tha andleeb ki akela sab kuch karne ko pehla tou us ki shadi karne ki pari thi andleeb ke parents ko ab aa gaye ha aur andleeb apni harkatein bhool gayi seriously itna sab kuch karne ke bad jab numaair ne sab kuch bhula diya tou yeh andleeb ku nahi chor deti pehle tou andleeb kou chor gayi thi ab haq bata rahe ha
Hii
Ma b waki vre good
Jb Zindagi Sy dukh or takleefyn khtam na ho ry hn to jaga badl k dekh lena chahiye....
Andaleeb kuch zyada mature ho gayi hain 😂😂😂😂
Andleeb is non sence😂
Where is todays episode?
I dont think that in real life a mother can stay a few hours away from her a little baby,, And in Pakistan many woman face a lot of things with out telling any one just for thier kids,,, children makes the relationship more strong because they cause people to think just for a while
Andreea apna waqt bhool gaie jab moeeez k liye depressed thi tb numerous support her but she's very selfish......
New love story
Know she is doing very bed with numair he is also in pain more then her 😢

13:14 13:19 13:20 ❤❤❤
I hate andalip this behavior... 😏
Saare ka saara drama barbaad krdia h 😢😢😢😢.
جاں بلکل درست ہے
Kasam se bhaiibye andaleep sab se bekaar character lagta hai saare galat kaam khud karee or bole dosre kio what a duufer she iss moux ko bhi dhoka diyaa or numair ko bhi sesi larkiyaa dhika hi deserve karti hai and seriously mazboot aurat banni bhu numair ki vajahs eee verna roti rehti
Bibi tum galat ho
Ma
Apni beti ko to mele nai ayi itni patar dil maa
Andleeb k parents ksy han gr chor k Jana to ni thk na . Arsa bad I ha or parents ny Kuch ni kha .  Jb goliya khye then TB to umair ny qabool kiya tha ab ak bar sun to lati uski glati kiya the
What a non sense nd childish behaviour by andleeb even she has damen care for her kid ,how can be a mother selfish.
Andaleeb has no maturity. She is behaving as though she was perfect. She thinks she is doing right.  She should not raise the child with lack of maturity and understanding
AI Al sab btao Kon sa Ai hai aur Kon sa AL hai
Andaleeb jesy fazul aurten.
Andaleeb ka character pehly sry mashkuk thaa.    D n a to bnta tha
Numair kitna acha insan hei
😢
Ik BT smjh ni ai ...JB numair bap ni bn skta tha..Tu andleeb man ksy ban gai ..toixc😮...koi Tu btaye yr
ghaseet ray bus🤣
Andalaeep is so ignorant and probably has the worst character in any drama I’ve watched
Andleep ko zara b anadil ka khayal nhi
Jab dukh or gham halky na ho rhy ho to fasly ikhtiyar kr lene chahie 😢😢
Y they didn't show how he reacted after knowing his wife is alive ?
Just realising andleeb completely forget nat support numair numair have many fault and he understand          understand  it's the child who is supporting  and suffering 15.18
Ye andleeb apne parents ke bss m kyu nhi aati apni mrzi krti 😅
Report main kia hai
Baby kiskaa hai phir
Andleeb galat hai😂
Andalep is a bad mom. Absolutely worst mom. How can she forget her baby? How come she’s not dying to meet her daughter? How much she’s not dying to hug & kiss her? That’s just weird. She’s immature. Numair deserves better.
Bekar drama and bekar andleep character
Bakwas serial
In this drama, best acting is done by Mawra ❤
Isne khud kya kiya tha yeh bhul gayi hai kyaaa  Numair ne iske liye itna kuch kiya hai bo kyaa
Zahar LG rahi Hy andaleep bakwaas Kari ja rahi hy
Bohat hi bakwaas drama KR dia Hy. Andaleep sahiba apni harkatain bhool gai Hy. Had Hy bakwaas fazool.
Ye Deebu to jada hi sar pr chd rhi h.. Apne din bhul gyi
aur apni beti ko bhi bhool gae
andleeb apna kia hua dhoka sb bhool gae
Itna irritating character hai ye andaleeb seriously oye madam tm bhe koi dhood ki dhuli thori the phr bhe numair ny tmara sath dia glti tmse bhe hui the us ny tmain maf kr dia tha ab tm kr do drami kahin ki
Jaff
I never thought I could resent andaleeb so much! This is it! Dil kara to chodke chalegaye beti ko, dil kare wapas ake baap se cheen lein!
Why can't Zara tell Andaleeb the truth?! So it can solve issues..lol Star plus ka drama
EXTREMELY negative and wrong concept giving drama. I was loving the story in the starting.  Matlab jo bhi kuch ghalat hota ha larki k sath yeh GHAR SE BHAAG jati ha .  Bf ka hoa bhaag gae  Mia se hoa bhaag gae  Bhai kia concept de rahe ha aap . And family aur larka maafi maang rahe ha k bhae shukar tm agae . Nobody is telling her that why u ran away. Why didnt u face and talk .
Pata ni kesi ma hai andileeb,drame baz
Such a faltu script....
Numair is such a pure soul he doesn't deserve andleeb at al .... andleeb ko aatay sath itna protocol q do thapar laganay chahiye the or wapis le k jati apni itni so called self respect... she is selfish arrogant and what not
am i only one who thinks numair has loose some weight 😅
Numair and andleeb is just time wasting
it became so toxic now ....but we can't help it we have to see 😅
Writer shuru tu kr betha hy pr ab usy smjh nae aa rhe khatam kesy kry..... 😅
Andaleeb is a very irritating character 😑😑 she has always been a source of trouble for everyone 😢& even now she is still making problems.
❤❤❤
Kitne comments like karu 🤭 bs khatam kr do kisi surat is dramey ko 🤯
Andaleep apne boyfriend k saath mili hui hai shayad 😂
Leo numair ko gina rahi hai Naya saher naye ye naya wo matlab usne thodi ghar se nikala tha bewakoof andleeb
Zara ke liye happy ending chahiye hai  .
Andleeb is so selfish
How ridiculous story 👎👎larkon ko bilawajha baghi bna raha
Luxury car or Nokri nahi banday k pass😅
Naya hero 🙌
Its like an indian drama 😂 one seen daily .😂😂😂😂
Very disheartening episode 💔 Feeling very sad for Andaleeb 🥺 & Numair both . Yeh ni hona chahiye tha.
Jab tak hasan tha tab kak bada maza aaya drame me ab bahut boring ho gya hai🤣🤣🤣
Best Darama❤🎉💕💖💯💘
Ab ye andleeb Kuch zyada hi over ho rhi h🤬
What a ridiculous behaviour, a wife and a husbands relationship has been shown as a game here lol
Andalleb ka hr br ekka ek chodkar dusre pa pyar a jta h
Bakwas bakwas only bakwas...
Yas nahin karna chahie comment
Bakwasss ker diyaaa
Numair. N andaleeb ko maaf kra but andaleeb nhi kr rhi 😂😂😂
Deebi's mother is such a mature women
Deepu is wrong 12:17
Andaleeb ne kaise past bhool gayi!! Numair & uske family ne kitna sath diye jab khud ki family ne koi sath nehi diya! Uske parents ne yeh kyun nehi bola ki, Tum ne aap ni beti ko chor kar kaise chali gayi!! Tum Numair ko maf nehi kar sakti lekin aap ni daughter ko chor kar chali gayi!! Disgusting.
Dr numair ko andleeb ke wapsi ka pta kasy chla Ye scene mj kahen nzr nai aaia
Yeh kiya pagalo ka drama haii 😂😂😂😂
Aaj joh bade abhiman se bol rahi hai k main ab khud sab kuch kar sakti hu job bhi toh tu andaleeb yeah bhul gai k usko is bade makam par bhi numer ne hi pohchaya hai padai karvai duniya se ladna sikhaya yeah sab usne sikhaya hai
Zara ko pta ha DNA ka reason, andleep ky parents ko pta ha .. Bs andleep ko he koi nae btaraha kay DNA kiun krwaya numair ny 🙄
Konsi aziyat balki tum sab ko aziyat humesha deti ho apni beti ka bhi nahi soch rahi kaise maa hai yeah
Abhi bhi woh sirf apna hi soch rahi hai
Konsi izzat jab ghar se bhag gayi thi, Shadi ki raat jab sleeping pills khai thi tab izzat kaha gai thi
ufff so much dragged,  Andaleb justification are all based on childish behaviour, when somone becomes a parent their priority is their child not their ego.
Parlor ka kam saikh kar mazbot hogie hain hahahaha
Pathetic ending 😅 more than a drama ... Kasmain
adiuence be like: na dek sakte hain or na chor sakte hain😂
Drama is sponsored by BABA BANGALI🤣
Andaleeb had always been a toxic, confused, selfish and over emotional character who doesn't know when and how to take better decision? Whatever she tolerated was the result of her own actions and now she is blaming everyone.. If she would have listened numair when he went for dna, situation had not been that much worst...  Moreover, Zara is the most sensible character in the drama but she didn't get what she deserved. On the other hand, deebu got what she never deserved and hence, devalued all efforts...
After what Andleeb said at 30min with such hatred, it'll be VERY INSULTING for Dr Numair to go back to her. He should divorce her as she's a stupid person.
Stupidest drama!! Can someone tell Andaleeb that Numair is infertile so he did the test. Also, she was in a relationship with another man!! And committed suicide for him!! Soo stupid what writer has made of this drama!!
Andleep i uska numair ko pta lga uska reaction esa koi scene q nhe bnaya gya he's so normal k wapis aa gayi 😅
I agree with you 🙋🏼‍♀️
I'm happy for zara ❤
Andleep kuch jiyeda kar raha hein..numair kho bhi ek chance dena chahiye
Aik shaks jo apni beti aur apne maa baap ko chor kar chala jaye, woh acha insaan nahi. Andaleep buri hai.
drama could not be worse. kudos to the writer
Andleeb galat kar rahi hai  Kya kare bechari aakhir ladki hi hai na apni aukat dikha hi deti hai  Is drame se ye bhi sabit ho gaya ki chahe jitni ladki ko support kardo lekin wo ek baar bhi aapke liye nhi soch sakti
❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤🎉
Ye banda kon hay jis nay ye drama likha hay or fazool jaga phasa diya ajeeb dilauge or pheeki akard
ANDLEEP ki fazool ki akard - ek shakhas bata raha apni galti - or phir jab khud kisi or main involve theh or shadi kay din neend ki tablet kha li tab Nomair hi tha jis nay samjha - shokhi 😀😀
faltu story ko ghuma rahe.. hero ko khud par shak tha itni si bat clear kyu nahi kar raha hero..deebu ke waledn
Pakistani dramas me talaaq ko kitna easy simple dikhaane lge h 😮
Andleeb character getting bored
Andleep is totally wrong because ak maa bri bri se musebt jheel leti h Lekin olad ki khatir smjhota krti h .Lekin ye choti bachi ko aram se chor k chli gae
Good entry Shahbaz shigri❤❤
Andaleeb ko apna past yad krna chye jb numair ne usse support kia even k jb usky parents b uska sath chorchuke the.she should dialogue with numair and try to understand him also.
Bakwas drama
Andleeb over acting kr rhi ha
Andleeb is fazool character no sense
Thanks 29 subscribers ❤❤❤❤
Andaleeb kuch zyada hi over ho rhi hai Numair ky ahsan bhol gyi itni jldi
Asa knsa teer marlia is ny jo ya mzboot hoge ha😂😂😂
Agar baap nhi bun sakta to anadil kis ki beti hai
Bro why Zara is not telling andaleeb about his past problem about what was the reason of DNA 🫤😤🫠
Bro why Zara is not telling andaleeb about his past problem about what was the reason of DNA 🫤😤🫠
Andaleep:itne barhe sheher mai akeli kiya kuch saha hai to by choice gai thi na kisi ne nikala torhi tha ghr se
Why the hell is her parents not telling the Truth about numair becuas she still doesn't know
Andaleep abbkeh rahi hai k divorce k baad apni beti ko le legi to chorha q tha phir
Bilkol thek
Andaleep ko na hi pehle apni maa baap ki izzat ki parwq thi or na hi ab apni beti ki parwah boht hi selfish hai andaleep ka character
Andaleep apni harkatein bhool gai
Orat ka yahi k 2 paise kiya kama leti hai khud ko kuch smjhne lagti hai gharoor ajata hai but sach to ye hai k iss duniya mai orat aik mard k baghair kuch b nhi hai or na hi kr sakti hai
Andaleep ki maa keh rahi hai k mai kabhi soch b nhi sakti k numair ka asli roop ye hoga To numair ne aisa kya kiya hai maara hai peeta hai galiyan di ya os pr questioning ki hai samne jo aisi bol rahi hai os bechare ne to bs apne hi dik me saha hai ot chup chap ja k test kraya apni tasali keliye to aisa konsa zulm kr diya ot apni beti ki ghaltiyan nhi nazar arahi
Andleeb zaida over ho rhii
بکواس ڈرامہ  اندلیپ  کا کردار بالکل بکواس ہے۔
Boring ho gia ha daeamaaa😢
She forgot tht she had dn wrong to him cauz of her boyfriend n he forgived her.. This is so unacceptable
Andleeb ka Jo blunder Dr numair ny handle Kiya hatsoff now she is acting immaturely
Deebu character is so toxic ,numair deserve Dr Zara , no match with deebu such nonsense girl
Bht bore hogya he dramaaa end ku nh kr rhiii
Bhai sahab khula to aise bola ja raha hai jaise aao sanam jao sanam

andaleeb ne b to galti ki thi. tb Numair ne usko talaq ni d. ab Numair ki galti pe andaleeb khula leny ja ri hy. what non sense?
Bht he bkwas story ho Gai ha star plus wali
Vote for Happy Ending ❤
Oh god i hate deebu how she can forget that she was actually in love with other man and her parebts were ignoring her the only person who was staying with her was numair! What type of immaturity is this? I have starter hating her from bottom of my heart
Waheeyat ho gya hai ye serial kya chah rhi hai andaleeb thoda toh reality se related honi chahiye cheeze
Yes
I love comment section more than show😂😂
Pure serial ki aise taise kr di hai suru mi itna acha tha or aab boring
Off hoo me numair ka reaction dekhna chahti thi k jab wo andleep ko zinda dekhta h to usko kitni Khushi hoti h.. lkn ye scene in logo ne q NH dikhya h or parents ne jab numair ko andleep k zinda honay ka btaya to bhi uska koi shocking reaction NH tha akhir ye sab normal q rehty hn itnay ziada
Saher serious character me achhi nhi lgti😂
This is the most irritating drama I have ever watched… she is the most selfish mother.. a father is essential for the daughter..
😂😂😂
Andaleeb has some serious issues. She needs to see a psychiatrist first. She hasn't done anything great by working in a parlor. She is an ungrateful person. Andaleeb is not on the ground, she thinks she can do whatever she wants, 1st Muyeed now Numair
Jafaa then : 🗿 Jafaa Now : 🤡
Andaleeb’ s step of quitting home is another bad lesson for new generation. For no reason she just poses to b strong n confident. She is a worst daughter and mother
Wah, Pakistan me bhi log Hath jod k mafi mangte hai
Andleeb ki aur Hasan ki shadi krwa do
Agla episode kv aayega
I was excited watching this drama but now its become so boring
Like numer best man very good husband
Drama is too much boring now and dragging khamkha
Ache bhalay drama ko joke bna dia deebu did so wrong who agree
Flawed storyline
Andleeb seriously is over reacting
Andaleeeeebb zehar lgrhi haiii
I wonder konsi izzat aur waqar ki baat bar bar ho rai he. She ran away 2 to three times with a boy, secretly met the boy at night in her very home and then she committed suicide fir a boy... Yet she is talking about izzat aur waqar ....and what kind of parents they are who have forgotten all these things
Most annoying character award goes to Numairs Mom. Chahay kuch bhi halat hun aunty jee ka makeup full fledge rehta hai 😂
Debu to wrong hay he lakin us k amma abba ko bhi yad nahe kesay numair ne in ki beti ki itni galtio ko maaf kia tha
Im literally so sad for Numair, i started crying..Analeeb should of forgive his mistake 😭😭
اگر نیتوں کا اثر چہروں پہ نظر آنے لگتا تو معاشرے کا ہر فرد نقاب کرنے پر مجبور ہو جاتا
Bakwas krdiya Drama.....ye kya baat hui itni choti bacchi ko konsi maa chor deti hai ...numair ki baat sune bina sirf apna hi decision Le rhi hai...selfish
Andaleeb is overreacting...
Kyu lamba kar rahe ha drama ko andleeb ke parents neh secret kyu nhee bataya or numair bhi atni bata kar ke chala gya phele bolna tha
Andaleeb is the perfect example of immature girls of our society.
Andleeb ko jootiyan laganay wala koi nhi😂
Andaleeb is least bother about her daughter, immature people are selfish
O Bhai itna bkwas drama kr diya h is Sy acha khtm hi kr do bor kiun kr k Dil khrb kr rahy ho
Inthai bkwas drama
How can someone forget that when no one stood up with her, not even her parents he is that guy who supported her. When he asked for a chance to explain himself, she should have let him, after all that he did, this is what he’s getting.
Could this drama have become any dumber? The story plot toward the end became utterly stupid. Seems like a rush to happy ending with unrealistic and almost laughable sequences.   Going to stick to ARY for my precious time!
Andleeb ab zda e shokhi hori h 4 din mn e ye strong independent bn gai h gadhi
So irritating yar.. worst ending..
woman’s Lib 👍👍👍strong story 😮
Andaleeb kal b bewakoof thi aj b bewakoof hi aur agae b bewakoof hi rahegi ..tou Numair ko sochna chahiye
Andaleeb is lost her mind
Don’t drag this drama please…. And andaleeb is such a selfish girl who can’t see numairs love 😢
Ghr valo ka dhukh bhul gai
Ye larki Sahar iski Urdu surprisingly kaafi behter hai iski age ki dursi actresses k muqable main mujhy acha laga ❤
Fzol ho gya yh drama
Larki shuro say he pagal hy
Debu pagli hogai hai aur ye drama pura bakws
Andaleep ka to pahle din se hi tamasha chal Raha hai numair hi ko isko chor Dena chahye ab to
27 : 16 numair stand in punishment 😂😂😂
4 paise kama k dimag asman pr ha madam ka apna waqt bhool gai ha jb numair ne iski aur isk maa baap ki izzat rkhi th
Andaleb kuch zyada nhi kari
❤
Agr numair baap nahi ban skta tha to ye bacha phir aya kha se 🤔
Agr numair baap nahi ban skta tha to ye bacha phir aya kha se 🤔
Matlab kia hai yeh Numair ne Andleeb ki kitni bari ghalati Nazar andaz kr di thi Kon krta hai yeh  Or ab Andleeb ki bari hai maaf krne ki Nazar andaz krne ki
নিজের মেয়ের প্রতিও কোনো মায়া নাই
Andaleep is so boring and irritating.
Now i realize that zara was better than andaleep she is over reacting and playing an immature role!
Wow❤❤❤❤My fabrat
Bus krdo bhai is dramy ko end krdo.. itni toxicity 😢😢in 😢
Aap log btayen kay andaleeb ki is dramay main mistake hai
Bekar Ur illogical drama
Andaaleeb ka over hojara zara😂
So irritating to watch debu overacting.. completely nonsense display of anger
কেউ বাংলাতে বলবা প্লিজ যে নুমায়ের কি বললো।  ও বাবা হতে পারবে না কলেজে টেস্ট করে ও এটা জানতে পারছে।  এটা বুঝেছি কিন্তু ডিএনএ-র রেজাল্ট এর কথা কি বললো?? বলো কেউ..  হিন্দি তেমন বুঝিনা
Number apni jaga thikh hai andalip Galt hai
8:09 princess treatment ❤
Yaar ye Andaleeb kitana over kar rahi haiii
Ufff andaleb`s attitude 😅
Debo ki trah me bhi Ghar se for bhagna chahti houn...phr aik dam se wapis aun or Sab set ho😢
Hodi karti or hodi puchti ho
Vote for happy ending
Andleeb is senseless...
Hum ladke ha last me humare sat aise hii ho ta h
People who are angry at Andleeb 🥺
Intaaahayiii ghatiya pan dikhare hen, andaleeb ka sath uske husband ne us wqt dia jab tamam husband bagair sochewe hue divorce kardete hen uskay cheap panay ko ignore kia uska sath dia aur ye sirf ek ghalati wo bhi jiska genuine reason wo bata raha hai us par wo usko maaf nhi kari aur bolri hai k jaal bichare hen wo log even tho usko itne ache mil mili sil mili ... mene ye phli episode hai jo fast fwd dekhii lagta hau humtv walay drama banana bhool gye hain ,barhaane k liye usmein star plus ki acring add kardete hen ajeeb
Koi andaleeb ko do dhapar ki nahi lgata
Lrki boht baihs dkkhai is drama Mai bs APna sochti ha or ksi ka nai
Writer kya dekhana chahti ha
Andaleeb fazuul character ha
Andaleeb ek intihai akru or anaprast orat ha..... Easy bilkul bhi had nahi k kese number NY us ki he galti mafe kr k us ka sath day... Ab khudprast bani hui ha.... Chawal.... Apni beti ko bhi ap ny Jess hi bnae gi choty damage wali.... Bachi numair k pas rehna chahye wo zyada achi yarbiyat Kare ga
Ye jo andaleeb bolri hai itna bara sehr … wah khud gai chor kr kisny bola jay chor kr
Batameez debo phely bhi ti aur ab bhi hai
Dr.Numair is just relying on old report,why is he not getting his new test done,
Pure rubbish it has become
Deebu's parents r such hypocrite. And I don't even see numai's fault. Wtf deebu is so angry about she ain't perfect wtf this is too much
Andaleeb is getting over!!!! Now this drama is getting bored..!! In her every hard situation numair support her then why she react like this??? People are always wrong in this world 😊 she should accept numair and forgiven him!!! In my opinion 🙏🏻
deepu is the worst character 😢 nonsense
All
Bhai DNA krana chahta tha numair bcoz he was doubtful  and look where drama is leading noe
Good wale done agar ap ko is bat ka hassas hogaya ha tu
Dr Sameer pehle khud drive kr raha tha after picking zara driver kahan se aya
❤❤❤
Hassan is not psyco, it's andaleeb.. numair should have given divorce initially, when this pagal lady was in love with moiz.. too much ego ... Just finish this it's getting boring
Now Andaleeb is too much
Andaleeb is so irritating
Moral of the story: shadi mat karee 😅
Yaaaar koi bhi itna independent Nahi ho Jata thori c deeer me but andleeb to Jese Imran khan ban gai he 😅
2x me dekhne wale
When will this 💩 show end
Wasn’t Zara a specialist already lol
Ye bap nahi ban sakta toh wo pregnant kese ho gai 😢
আগে ভালো ছিল। এখন ফালতু হয়ে যাচ্ছে 🤦‍♂️
یہ نمیر باپ نہیں بن سکتا ۔۔تو عنادل کیسے آ گئی😮
Andaleeb is cruel
Itna bakwas drama h aur andaleeb is intolerable seher khan should leave acting field she is very poor in acting
Andaleeb toh aise act kar rahi jaise khud sati savitri h aur itna itra rahi h jaise koi company ki CEO H
Bilkul sahi kaha aapne
Andleeb is so immature... Acha hota jab numair khula deta jab isne apne romeo ke liye zehar khaya
When did Numair find out about andaleeps return!!!
Agar numair ki bahan ne shadi ki raat suicide attempt ki hoti kya tab bhi numair ki maa asy e wo baat dohrati?  Wo ghalti thi khud kah rahi hyn, jisay maaf kar ka andleeb ko baiti kahti thi ... Jo ghalti maaf kar de jaye loug ussa bhoolty ku nahi?
Kya bakwas story kar di ... Ye jo ab accept kar rha hai tabhi biwi k samny kar leta ... Biwi samjh leti hai iss baat ko wohi khatm kar deti Ab poray tabbar k samny bta rha hai... Bilawajha baat ko khench k 4 episodes daal de hyn 😒
Yar andaleeb zada over ho ri apna time bhool gae jab numair na sath dea tha us ka jab koi ma bap tak sath nahi de rha tha
niche khndn k logo ki beti 🫡
Andleeb APNA past Bhool Gai ha Jo Kuch Karti rhi ha
These are the reasons why we have high divorce ratio in our society now because of this liberal approach..
It's interesting to note how the characters have been consistent throughout this drama. Hasan ko chalo ghayab kerdiya. But Zara, who has been such strong women, she fell she shattered, but never let herself get demolished. She stood up for herself, tried to find her way and went on with her life gracefully. Numair, a character with a weak personality, who portrays himself so nice, but infact, cannot face his weaknesses and always tries to runaway from them, conceals himself, as he can't face the reality and falls prey to his doubts. Then there's andaleeb, I mean like wth is that characters!??! Kuchh BHI ho, bas mar Jao, khdkushee kerlo, such an idiot, the everlasting immaturity of andaleeb, such a lesson for everyone, khud to zaleel Hoti hai, sath baqiyon ko Bhi khawaar kerwati hai, an extremely immature girl, who gets extremely emotional, extremely fast and takes stupid senseless decisions that have the potential to destroy her entire life.  The fact is though, that all these characters have such consistency that you connect with them so finely, you don't even notice, they've been so consistent with their traits along the whole drama, which is worth praising. Now, I know that the story has major loopholes and could have been much better, but what I'm saying is that at least, they've put effort in the characters development of all characters in all aspects, even if they forget to put sense into the story.😅😂
Fuzool drama na sir na pair
100 chuhe kha k billi hajj ko chali Andleeb 😅
I don't agree with Andleeb. She destroyed the image of numair n herself too, by the publicuty of DNA. Numair did not show anything about the DNA but andleeb herself is telling everyone about this.
Hey u r doctor lol. U should collect anadils hair for dna  instead of anadil
Numair ny bhi to maaf Kiya tha ab andaleeb Ka farz h k maaf kry JB k numair ny galat Kuch nhi kiya
Ab hum jis karb aur aziat se guzar rahay hain uska bhi khyal karo😂 Khatam karo ab
Deebu's character is such a bakwaas...she is so sick
Who hate andleeb behaviour 🤕🤕🤫🤦🤦🤦
Finally zara weds a beautiful handsome boy 👦 ❤
Pehle bhi khud ka soch kar ghar se bhagi thi abhi bhi khud ka soch kar khula
Andalib bht over kar rahi hai use kuch bhi nh mlm
This is worst script
Shaadi k baad bhi Andalib uske friend k sath ja rahi thi tab uski izzat kaha thi
Andaleeb se zyada tou andaleeb ke parents annoying hain 🙄 khud he pehlay numair ke sahare chor diya.
Kab Andalib ghar chhod kar gai tab uski and uski parents ki izzat kaha thi
Unlogic Unrealistic ending
Btw she came to see her daughter only and never asked about her! lol! She still thinks about herself and herself only!
Andalib ghar chhod kar gai tab uski izzat kaha thi , shadi ke baad suicide kar ne ki koshish Kari tab uski izzat kaha gai?? Bhag Jane k baad baap k ghar vapas aai and unhone accept Kiya tab uski izzat kaha thi.maafi to andalib ko mangani chahiye jo vapas aa kar Numair family wants to accept. In reality no one accept her .
Upar se itana ego
No religion will accept Andalib, jab man chahe Ghar chhod k chali gayi jab chahe vapas aa gayi. Uska already affairs tha koi bhi Shak kar sakata tha .
She is going Dallas for specialization aur parents relatives see off krny nhi aay. 😮
Andleeb bibi jabkhud husband k hoty huy doosray larky ko  k peechy bhagti rahi apna mazi bhool k satti sawitri bani hue hai laanat hai apny aap ko sheshy main dekhy
Ab andalib ka character nhi psnd araha kon kon agree hai
Day by day I am hating this drama...
Intehai nasamjh character hai andaleeb ka. Wo khud ko strong or independent smjh rhi hai. Just parlour mai part time job kr k  😅... wo khud jaisy immature hai... izzat numair nh krta to phr izzat hoti kia hai.. she forgot about her past. And he was just shocked to know about pregnancy as he was sterile.. to uska Behaviour obvious tha koi b hota numair ki.jaga wo shayad itna hi pareshan hota
Andaleebs' character is too much. She is overreacting
Just prolonging the drama… bas yaar!!! Finish it…
😂😂
Worst series
Main apki bat sey mutafiq Hu 23:17
Main apki bat sey mutafiq Hu 23:17
Main apki bat sey mutafiq Hu
Bas karain .. drama ab boring ho raha hay
Andleeb k ab tamashe khatm e ni h0 rahe 🙄
Digital Slap for Andaleeb!
Andleeb ny tissue ka issue bna dia 😅 I don't know why they're dragging this bullshit and making us feel bored😑
Andleeb ny choti c baat ka itna issue create kr dia Numair k sarey Sacrifices bhul gai 😢
This should be the last episode with happy ending,,  andleeb is doing too much now 🙄🙄😠
The character of andleeb forgot, how numiar supported her, when her own parents were ready to abandoned her, lol, she's so annoying dude
Andaleep is the worse actor....
Hafte me ak episode aata hai kya yaar
😢😢😢
Numair clearly deserves better
Andleeb kyun itna over react Kr rahi hai khud shadi Sy pehly or shadi ki Raat ko Kya Kya Kr chuki
3 din me drama pora dekhli😂😂😂
Such a waste drama no meaning no story line
Rediculous and boring
Episode barhane k liye bht hi by tukka kr rhy hyn drama or andleeb Kuch zyada hi over ho gai
Deenu kesi maa hai? Ajeeb
Everyone thinking drama is getting serious mean while me the baby is so cute adorable I love anadill
16:08 & 21:44 andleeb k parents usy waja q nahi bata rahe k nomair ne DNA kis waja se karwaya, 27:16 nomair ne b nahi bataya reason!!! Ajeeb!!! Drag kar rahe hain dramay ko 😒
jab khud madam ne shadi ki rat suicide attempt kiya tha tab numair b talaq de sakta tha..us ne b to bardasht kiya. isay apne ghar laya usay pyar diya.or ye kam zarf is ki ghalti maaf nhi kar sakti.  wakayi zarf zarf ki bat hoti
I can't spend one day without my children....  How could Andaleeb stay away from her child... She is a bad mother
Zara ko airport koi chorny nahi aya😂😂😂
The way he said: mat jao yaaar❤❤❤❤ 4:02
Drama ki ache khasi story ka satyanas kardia. Na Andeleep bardast ho rahe ha na drama
Allah pak se daw hai ki hum ko be Asia husband chaiye 😂😂
Writer is giving very wrong msg....  Numair accepted andleeb with her loose character... Even tolerated his boy frnd...and accepted her in worst condition.... On the other hand andleeb is doing tooo much ... Such bkwas fazul ghatia character.....
Qirdar..andleeb kuch over acting kr rahi. Phla isi ki galti thi jis pr shaq hona koi bari bat ni thi numair ko bolna cahhiye ainaa dikhana chahiye tha
ALLAH PAK andleeb jesi beti kisi ko na de  bhera  gherk  ker dia he maan baap ka

Andleep Ahsan faramosh
Andaleeb totally overacting
What crap!!
I was wondering why Andleeb is looking weird then I noticed she is using lens  Pata nahi aaj ka l kya ho gaya hai actresses ko, to look beautiful they make themselves ugly by overdoing the things, sach kaha hai kisi ne , " Excess of everything is bad
Independent awrat serf apni Ghar ujarna janta hay or Kuch nehi 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am now gonna hate to Andleeb
Andeelip is so bakwas ... i hate her .. ek bar bhi beti ko dekhne nehi gayi ... so selfish
Andaleeb is so immature 😢
Bohot pazooll hogayr hai ye drama
G bilkul
Drama is going day by day boring 😏
Worst drama
Andaleeb case is so weak esay konsi mother ghar chor kar bachi chor ke jati ha court ke nazar mei she is careless mother and numair can easily win case.
The drama has gone  really boring and unrealistic 😒
what kind of girl is andaleeb. she has forgotten how numair stood for her. and what hardships. she should have talked to her parents instead of running away. she is an extremely immature person. dr numair deserves better
I don't know why Andleeb parents even Zara didn't tell her truth about Umair,the reason of why he did DNA test.
Mujhy to sb hi zehr lg rhy pehly andaleeb ny itni harkatn kn wo sb bhul gai ab numair ka ghlti gunnah lg rh jb k ausny it a support kia ab agr kamane lgi h is ka mtlb yea nh esa attitude dekhay gi or maa baap to pta nh kia hi hn jb bachi ghyb hojti kuch ghlt hota aus k sth to rony dhony lg jty jesy bht mohbt h ab ausko khud sy jane nh dngy jb bachi mil jti yea in k pass in k support k ley ati tb auska dimag khrb krty samjha samjha k wapis bhagty apny pass nh rakhty ajeeb
bro i hateeeeeeeeeee this drama like so toxic and that numair keeeeeepppps asking for forgiveness aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh it was going so well
Andaleeb has completely forgotten how Numair had supported her when she tried committing suicide even after getting married. She almost cheated on a new relationship. He proved his maturity and stood by her side when no one understood her. And now, she's over-reacting. That's why maturity is very important in a relationship.
Pata nhi kyu markers andaleeb ko bechara bana rhe jaise ki uspey bhot zulm huye ho seriously......? I don't know but I start hating this character (biggest villain) I don't know lekin koi maa to itne chotey bache ko chor ke nhi jaati ab achanak se anadil ke liye mohabbat jag uthi wow😮 really disappointing
Deebu is so over react 😕bichara numair 😢
Atleast give little update about moiz?
Hasn't Zara already done specialization? She's a gynecologist
Kisi ny b aik dfa nhi kaha k Numiar ko bap na banany ki bat shadi sy pehly krni chahiay thi na zara ny na andleeb k parents ny
Frankly speaking the story sequence is not good how it used to be
Zara is doctor why is she going abroad for taleem 😂😂
So as usual bad to worst the drama has become. First, Zara is suddenly leaving to the US and her family is not seeing her off or nobody has told anything in that matter? Way too unrealistic. Second, till now no improvement in Hasan's track they should show that recovery of mental health is important. Third, as usual immaturity at peak in both Numair and Andaleep's storyline. I agree Numair didn't doubt her character but he should have clearly communicated because DNA test is ultimately doubting your wife's character. Being a doctor he should have dealt with it in a better way. Worst of all how is it so normal for someone to randomly go missing and return like its normal? Won't there be police report and so much interrogation? It's too unrealistic that they showed no reaction of Numair getting to know his wife is alive and meeting her? How did you not show that scene? As usual irritating immature characters from top to bottom Andaleeb,Her parents, and especially Numair ki mother who is hardly bothered. Deebu zinda hai toh theek hai😂😂mar gayi koi baat nahi doosri shaadi karlo hume kya fark padta bas ek bahu chahiye😂😂Deebu forgot how her husband forgave her suicide but you can't blame her she has been immature from start. But her parents are fully at fault. Bad to worst
Naati bahut Badmash hai
Zaara Or mai ab apne liye sochnge😅
Apni galti per gaur Karen and Dilip khud kya thi padh lenge
Numeric ko ek mauka Dena chahie and Dilip ko
Itne attitude mein Nahin rahana chahie insan ko
Itni badtamiz rula de and Dilip
Ye andaleeb kitna overreact kr rhi h
😊P😊l. 😊
Debbu ki mom ka make up neechy sy oper aany m change ho gya
Numair sabse kh sakta apni personal baat mgr mg apni biwi se ni kh sakta😂  .
Where is that scene where Hassan commits suicide from the roof top?? Mawra and Usman Mukhtar are looking so good together.
Yh andleeb ki sass bari double standard ha qasmy
Andalib is too much,,,chaar paise kamaa liye or hawaa me udd rahi h,, , nonsense
Numair ko kub pata chala ke Adleeb wapis aa geyi hai
Ik deepu na jan tang ki hoi a😂😂
Khud kon si Shareef thi mohtrma andaleep shadi se pehle
Yr tere ishq main Wafa bhi  hai jafaa bhi hai  meaning
Vote if u lyk anadil's cute gestures while his father is taking to her

Dr sameer is the guy Aaima bag was engaged to? I think, what's his name?
12:09 numair looking do handsome ✨🔥
That's not good  Andleeb khud bhi to Kisi k Liya mar rhi thi is ka bawjood Umar na usa apnaya.....
Zara is sensible
Boor drama
9:16 andleeb ny kia muskil waqt dekha hy??mjy to uska ghar sy bhagnay par ghusa a raha aur ajeeb laga..usny mushkil waqt ni dekha sab ko mushkil me dala hy .pahlay zehr kha lia phr ghar chor k chali gai aur ab a k mazlom ban rahi hy..itni bachi the to moiz sy chakkar kesy chala lia..numair k samnay b sari batay ati the isay..fazoool drama hy sach me
Andaleeb ne nis tarah moiz ki mohabbat ko 2 min me bhula diya tha waise hi numair ne 2 min me andaleeb ke character pe shaq kar liya i think ab andaleeb ke parents ko sukun mil gaya hoga
bro itni payari namek dani 0:59
Nice  ❤❤❤❤❤
Bohat hi drama ha
Irritating drama Faltu
Andilip it's so irritating she is very selfish. Wo pehle bhi selfish tha or abhi bhi selfish hai

Numair Zara ki bonding itni shi thi toh yhi dono shdi kar lete phle hi.😂
Bilkul b achi nhi lg rhi  andaleeb over acting krte hue apni ghltiyan bhool gai hai kiya pagal jitna mje ye drama pasand tha  end me otna bakwas kr diya hai
Aurat character pay BAAT bardasht nhe krte but JB sub clear ho gaya to andleep ko compromise krna chaheay baitee ke wjha say

Andaleeb bhul gayi hai ki usne bhi galti ki thi 😂 numair ne apnaya use ❤
9:13 opposite dialogues lag rhe the 😂😂
such a selfish lady....first she didn't think of her parents 😂 and now her daughter 😂
Skip skip karke dekhne waly attendec lagao😅😅😅
Too much boring now
Numair is such a pure soul...he deserves better,exactly like Zara...poor guy!!! He can raise her daughter far better than deebu...she is nothing just a immature, egoistic, selfish lady....she didn't think about her daughter then,and also now she is just thinking of herself....
Comment 💬 parne kon aya ha hazri lagao😂
tbh,nomair deserves better...
Andaleeb is so selfish ...she forgot the time so quickly when numair trust her and was on her side on her hard times .... What is she thinking ..not even think about the kid she is still acting so childish
Hm to made this drama for time pass
I must say,they ruin the drama...ig poor direction
Next part please
Bkwas hogya drma aisy he lmba kr rhy farigh
Who is the fan of hazrat muhammad

Dumb drama series.. Very poor story.. Good actors and bad storyline.. Sad
Worst drama ending ever😂🫠🤡🤡
Andaleeb bht overreact kr rhi hai wo bhool chuki hai k us ki itni bari bari ghaltiyon pr numair ne parda daal kr usey kitna support kiya tha
Zara ki dadu ko Hasan se shadi kara dena chahiye thi
complete baat Q nahi krta koe ..numair ny os py shak kr k DNA nahi kerwaya tha apni report ki wja sy kerwaya tha k yai mojza hai ya kuch or .. that's it...but gooma gooma k batain kr rahe hain sb...zara to larki thi apni cousin ko puri baat details sy samjha skti thi pr nahi...damagh kharab kr dia hai
Waisay, tbh I feel like andaleeb is so stupid 😭 like imagine abandoning ur child because ur husband did a dna test. First of all, it's not that big of a deal. She did have an affair before her marriage, plus numairs infertility issue was there. Numair should've just told her about it. And wth is she taking a divorce? Yar, this is such a weird drama that nothing makes sense anymore
Story line is really bad 😂😂
Baap ni ban Sakta ths tou Kesy bana
What has happened to these dramas nowadays....yahan andaleep aur sunn mere dil mein Sadaf...dono bakwaas characters hain
So beautiful drama ❤❤❤ I love you too         ❤❤        Both  beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
is this episode missing scenes? I don't remember seeing Andaleeb and Anadil reunite , same for Andaleeb and Nomair ???? Thank god Zara left this stupidity jungle , but when and why she thought of studying overseas????  Sad this drama had  such a beautiful start and topic but now it's just dragging , just like some of other Hum dramas .please finish it !
Aysay dramay daykh ky larkio ky dimagh kharab hoty haiyn aur woh apna ghar kharab karti haiyn

Us bchi ka bap kon h ye hi poch lo beti sy walden ke ezzat kise gher mard ky hatho herab kr ky etni akker thankfull hony ky bnaey toba astaghferulla
Dude i believe both numair and anadil deserve better people in their life as compared to andaleeb
iss dramay mein andleeb our numair ki divource ho jani hay
andleeb galat kar rahi hay ab itnay yaraanay dhalay gi to kisi ko bhi shuk ho ga
Andaleep is overacting too much  She has to give one chance to numair
❤❤❤❤❤
Itni overacting andaleeb ki 😒🙄
😊
Andaleeb is too much.......Uffffff😠😠😠
Prisoner 804
This was so underrated 🤢
To behan numair ny bhi to samjhota kiya tha na. Tauba hai. Senseless acting!
Andaleeb bacche chale kar rahi hai
Actually andaleeb is still immature mujhe lga tha thodi maturity ajayegi par vo to aur immature ho gai.. koi bhi big decision se pahle ek dusre ko bat karne ka mauka to dena  chahiye par ye to apne parents tak ki nahi sun rahi hai
Please 🥺 happy ending karo 😅
Andleeb chwlen mar rhi
Boring drama
Hasan ko wapas laya jaye please 😅😅
Fazoool main lamba kartay ja rahay hain numair ne uski itniiiii bari galti maaf ki aur usko apni biwi ka darja dia aur wo kis trha se react kar rahi hai...fazoool ho gya hai drama..
Andleeb is very toxic
فکر نہ کریں سب کچھ مان جائے گی بس رائٹر کو 10 قسط اور چلانی ھے
Andaleeb kitni auqaat dikha rhi h 😅
Andleeb is too much reacting fazol.ma.over acting
Andleeb bht over acting kr rhi hy

Bakwas siriyal
Strange Deebu apny honor ki baat kr rhi...is jaisi lrkion ki b koi izzat hoti adhi raat ko lrkon ko chori ghar m ghusti...isky parents ko reality check dena chahye delusional Deebu mdm ko jo ab bari naik parsa bn rhi
Andleep says: ye rishta mere liy bojh bn gya h, and me: ye drama mere liy bojh bn gya 😂
Numair is Very irritating Seriously
Great writer sahab 🤦now selfish brat Deebu has become the hero of drama...Deebu is the most toxic and selfish character ever living in her own fantasy world of imagined pain and struggle
I hate andaleeb character because  wo jadaa emotional  ho kr sab kr rhi hai jaise ke wahi ek aurat hai jiske saath yai hua hai
Do Paisa kya kamane lgi ptaa nhi khud ko kya samajhti hai phle hi itna stupid decision Li aur phir le rhi h
Jb andleeb k character py bt ai thi to numair ny mard ho k bhi support kiya isko parhya confidence diya aj jb numair ki galti maf krny k bat ai to mdm ko bar bar apny gar chorny k dramy sojhy hain
Now Andaleeb is over reacting😒
This drama is getting worse , at first it was good but now it’s getting worse
Andleeb is such a fool and over reacting
Band kro yr is drama kro time waste h bekaar bilkul bekar itna slow aur fazool ki arguments had h I hate this drama 😡🤬
Andaleeb can’t forgive him for one mistake and the countless mistakes she made starting from day 1 of their marriage go unnoticed??? She is such a toxic character
She is overreacting now ...huh it becomes boring now😮

I think deebo has forgot that when deebu was in love with moize but moiz betrayed her then numair was also living with deebo and that time nobody was with deebo and still nymair was treating her so well😢
Andalep deserve thappar
Seriously this is the training going on in subconscious mind that as soon as girl is getting employed, the don't need men Seriously
Andaleeb is such a child still now!
This Actor Mukhtar is the Worst actor with fakest expression more like a CartoOn Face....He really needs a Proper Hair Style to suit his face actually
2 thappar lgne chahyen andaleeb ko
Andaleeb APNA time bhul Gai h .KY os NY Kia nhi Kiya andaleeb KY lia
Andleeb doing over acting

😅
I love the part when numair was talking to his daughter with teary eyes ❤🥺
Numair ne izt di deebu sr pr charh gai
I love sehar khan❤❤❤❤
Andaleeb parents always starts thinking for her future when she's home😂when she is not home they are like plz give us our daughter bck😂😂
dekne k b jaldi hoti hn lekn jb dekty hn to sochty hn k waisy time waste kya
At 8:06 Zara😐
Kya mazak hai. Andaleep k parents aur Andaleep khud ajib egoistic aur pagal hai. Jab Numair bol hi raha hai ki woh baap nahi bann sakta aur ye log ulta Andaleep ke side le rahe hai 😑
Numair ko kese pata chal gaya ke andaleeb wapis agay hai wo konsa scene ta 😮
Bkwas
Numair's mother character is so worst.
Andaleeb ko abhi parlour wali Nikal de to Kya hai uske pass Pagal larki phir sark par rulee gi 😂😂😂😂😂😂 stupid wo moiz ko hi deserve krti thi numair jesa sensible insaan usko milna. Hi ni chahiye tha
Andaleeb parlour main job krke apne ap ko independent smajh rhi😂😂😂😂😂😂
Andaleeb abhi b amateur hai :D
One of the worst drama
What a bs drama.. hassan ki story toh gayab hi kardi
Skipp😂
This drama shows new hights of toxicity, no logic, mid drama change of course of story, extreme bullshit parents, epic false narratives and lots more. Khatam karo ab is ko khuda kay waastay. Jo bechara mard sab ko sambhalta raha woh aakhir main mujrim aur jo sab ka band bajati rahi woh misali mazboot aurat bana di. Hadd hai yar , maaf kar do
How could andaleeb not go and meet her daughter as soon as she returned
zara is the best character in this drama
Uff andaleeb is cringe!! Acting as if she was the perfect wife from day 1!
Happy for Zara. Her track was the only good thing in this drama. Andaleeb/Numair track was totally illogical from the beginning
Bht he bkwas h end .andleeb k character sy bht glt pegam mil raha h grls ko.
I'm laughing at those people who says Andaleeb is immature and wrong
Is episode se zyada comments achy he mere liye 😂
Itna boring hai maine pura episode 10 sec me dekha 😂
Thanks for 1690 SUBSCRIBERS ❤

Ager sub ki mothers andleep ki tara ho to kisi batti ka ger kharab na ho
Age ka episode dein please
Yeh to feminists wala drama hogeya.  I don't like that
Seriously andaleep shadi k time pe jo kuch ki kya us time pe numair ne jis tarah saath diya enhe o yaad nae bloody double standards
Andilip is over acting so much
Bachi k poti pishi etc se jan chura k bhag gae... Baki time b aise he guzar lena hai... Jab bchi zara aur bari ho gi tu custody le le gi😂
Pagal larki hai dabu😂
Ye rishta andleem k liye boj or hamare liye serial bor bn chuka h
Ye kya ho rhi hai 😒  Before 🤩🤩 After 🤡🤡
26:54 the moment where Andleeb is going to melt for numairrr.....
Jaffa starting ❤ Jaffa ending 🤡
Ye reshtia andaleeb ka liyee boj ban chuka ha or yee drama ab hamry liyee boj ban chuka ha deqa nh jatha😂 ...
😮😮😢😂❤😂🎉😢😮😅😅
Deebu ki ammi do rkh k lgaaa kyun ni deti usay.  Wo tu pagal he hi parents us s ziada pagal. Lolopopo lgaai hui deebu deebu kr k Do rkh k lgaao or hwalay kro husband k Bechara acha insan he wo bs usay ek moment ki saza mil gai Ab kia bchay ki jaan len ge 😂
Deebu is such a weak perplexed and bukwas character. A girl who tried to commit suicide on her wedding night for her boyfriend but her husband forgave her & now she is saying “men smjhota ni krun gi men maaf ni krun gi men brray krb s guzri hun” wtf. Such an immature girl, why girls even get married when they don’t understand what exactly marriage means.
What is happening? Wasn’t this drama addressing domestic violence. But now it is an Indian soapbox without any sense. Andaleeb forgot all those stupidity that numair had to put up with her. Not once she went to see her daughter. Waoo what a stand
Andaleep is too stubborn women should not be like that
Wah ji wah ghar ki akloti bachi ko koi airport chornay nahi gya 😂
Andaleeb is acting the same as she did with her boyfriend. Changing love as changing clothes LOL this drama is senseless
Ha hahaha
We Want Last Episode ASAP please 🙏😂🙏
Kaaha hain wo log jo kehte the ki andleeb father is mature he did right to marry her with another guy
Oh no ❤😂
Andaleeb forgets what she was doing before 😂😂😂 🤡
Bakwas bana dia dramaa Andeelb bhot misbehave kar rahi h
Understanding ho gaya hai dipu pura baat Sun Lo uska kya karna chahta hai😂
We used to call Hassan " pagaal" because of his children trauma ۔۔۔ but actual pagaals  are andaleeb and numair
Nobody z telling exact numair point of view,just stretching drama weak plot
Just end this stupid drama now... get the damn divorce done and end it
The drama started off so good and interesting now thats all gone
❤
I wish that numair become hassan 😃
STOP PROMOTING FREAKING Divorce culture
sorry andaleeb but before coming for numair , hes the one the acceoted you besides all your mistakes looool
Andaleeb is so impulsive 😭 who told her to live alone in the big city? She forgot how Numair accepted her knowing she loved someone else, forgot how he literally saved her life.
wtffff andaleeb ko aik chaper lagane ka dil kar raha hai
Dramay ki bajake rakhdi😂
Lolz dr zara ke ghar vaale bechari ko airport shorhne bhi nhi gye!  And ek hafte mei hospital ne resign accept bhi kr liya  And background mei Zara ne saare USMLE’s and formalities clear bhi kr li for ‘specialisation’  Haye mere rabba, Drama ka scriptwriter, director sab change kr diye hain kya since last few episodes?!!!
Andaleeb saying “ ab mein mature ho gii hun” is a big joke considering how she’s handling this situation, 4 months salon mein kaam karne se maturity agii hai is mei
Andleb wo waqt bhool gae k Jab numair ny ucka sath Diya tha even ucki glti zda brri thy. Or ab esay bn Rae hyy jesay khud doodh ki dhuli ho
Andaleep is right and wrong at same time.  • Agar numair mohobat kerta tou shak kio kerta?  • Agar numair mohobat na karta toh shadi ki pehli rat (sucide attempt) keh bawjood b andaleep ko kio support kerta? • Andaleep ko yad nahi kia? How supportive he was throughout.  • Andaleep should forgive and give him a chance as he did to her otherwise their child would suffer.
Itna acha show tha kya bna diya eska 🙂
The baby scene was too cute🥹🥹🥰🤌😭
Kia bakeas ha Kuch bhe Matlab... What long topic discussion... Writer baat Kia kehna Chahta ha?
Only one person sensible in whole drama  and that's  it is reality of  this drama this reward goes to only Zara ❤❤❤❤ for best supportive actress 🏆🏆🏆
Andaleeb khud pehli din shadi k baad bf k liye zeher khaa le to raasleela!!! Uske kirdaar pe bass shakk kr le numair to character dheela!
This drama needs to end, iska plot samjh nhi aaya
Andaleeb is a bad daughter, a bad wife and a terrible mother. Numair  actually should divorce her.
Was a fan of andaleeb's character until she left everyone even her child ... her character is not making any sense now  Dr zara is doing awesome dialogue delivery and expression are on top ❤
Only"JAFAA" fans can feel the happiness of Friday ❤❤
sari dunya ko btadia msla siwae andleep k. wah numair levell
Stupidest drama in the history of hum tv channel 😂
Whole world knows about Numair’s infertility except his own wife😂
Why are the characters always schizophrenic, over night personality changes
Numair should beg for andaleebs forgiveness, rather he's talking with rough tone. How will this ever melt her heart? Everyone's reaction is so poor
Andaleeb or baby ke rekhe kivbe jete pare.. Eta ekdomi valo lageni.. Numair er ucit ore ar na aste deya.. Ar jai paruk bacccatake rekhe kivbe cole gelo🙄
Samajh nahi araha andaleeb ki abb bhi itna ego 😅
Bekar ho gya drama
Hasan was mad because of trauma but still knew the value of relations while Andaleep being sane left her own baby and just left. 😮 🤯
Doesn’t it seem weird that numair is a Dr yet hasn’t still got himself checked .He say he didn’t look at results of DNA but still believes that he can’t have children so where does he think baby came from .maybe I missed something .??
when does dr numair find out that andaleep is still alive ???
Andaleep got too much confidence & ego after getting agood job. She has forgotten her past, it was numair who supported her when even her parents were against her. So numair also should get 1 chance
Akalmand aur so called strong aurat andaleep ki tarah apna ghar barbaad nhi krti kam se kam
Everyone saying wrong to andaleeb. But as a mom I understand pregnancy time was tough for her even though delivery. Her husband start attitude pregnancy time. That time she was most in need. Postpartum depression is also a thing 🤌🏼she need more love rite now and that’s why all characters supporting her and giving her love.
Andleeb zehr lagti ha 😡😡😡😏😏😏
Andaleeb ke perents ko proper reason use batadena chahiye tha , unnecessaryly story strech kar rahe hai 😏
Hamary rishtedar Faris mamo ki tarha Marty wapia aany pe😅
عندلیب کی جمع عنادل  عندلیب کا معنی بلبل  یوں ماں بیٹی کا ایک ہی نام
Deeboo sub say bari pagal hai Numair ke sari qurbanion ko bhool gai na beti yad hai na kuch or ,pagal nhi bulkay aapay say bahir larki hai or aisay character ko heroin bataya gaya hai jo na maa bap ke sunti hai or na he sohar ke
Bhhht hi koi dheeet hai ye andleeeb.....
Achcha nahin kar rahi hai Anjali and ek mauka Dena chahie numer ko nomad ne bhi to diya tha and mauk😢😢😢😢😢😢
Story ma bohat jhool hain shaid addit kar di gai batt clear nhi ho rahi _______zyada hain
Deebu is selfish
6:42  The only best thing appearing in the midst of boring scenes and extended stupidity of Andaleeb!😂❤
Usmle kiye bgair ja rhyy😂
Nonsense yr..chahe jo bhi ho jaye pr koi bhi ma apni aulad se dur nahi reh sakti aulad ke khatir to log kaise kaise husband ke sath tolerate krke rehte hai..zabardasti story ko bada kr diya hai.. mujhe to andaleeb pr gussa aa raha hai apne ma bap ka bhi nahi socha kitni aziyat di unhe bhi gayab hokar..
Andaleeb is not mad her problem is the problem of every working earning women this so called career oriented girls think themselves strong enough to fight everything but fact is only man is nothing without woman and woman is nothing without man when she committed suicide he supported her but now andaleb is weirdly acting as if she is most pious and perfect lady sorry writer should show her mirror very annoying episode ridiculous
Beti k liye Andleeb ko maan jana chahiye.
😅😅😅ab ye andalib fir se over acting kr rhi😅😅 aur ye to dikhaya hi ni ke numair ko pta kb chala k andalib zinda h😅😅 itna b short me nhi niptana chahiye
Numair ny apni infertility ka kyun nahi bataya Andaleeb ko??
I'm so done with this drama😭i literally dont understand why the hell they are dragging the story? 🙂khtm kyu nhi ho rha ye ....kya isse bhi boring koi drama ho skta h ?  😔👍🏻
27:14 yaar Numair ko piyar se baat kerni chahye thi
27:20  😅😅😅😅blaim😂😂
7:54 𝙒𝙖𝙝 𝙮𝙚𝙝 𝙩𝙤𝙝 𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙝 𝙢𝙖𝙞 𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙤 𝙝𝙖𝙞 >>>>>>>>😁💃
Andaleeb k parents k bedroom ka interior design kitna weird hai
Hasan Bahot Acha Insan tha Bas kabhi Kabhi Gussa Ajata Wo bhi Zara ki Galtiyo ki wajeh se Use villen Bana Diya In Logo Ne
strongt women 😂😂😂😂wtf
Drama hi bekar h bnane wale ne kuch soch kr nhi bnaya. Kuch nhi ho rha drama. Kbhi koi chla jata h aa jata h . Dadi pote ki zindagi karab kr deti h bt such nhi btati.
Fazol andaleb....... over acting
Tell me how is the drama, I liked it very much
😊
Bht attitude show kia h andalip ny... she forgot her own past..
Deepu is the most immature character before and even now. She didn’t even talk to her husband and left him and her child. She had a boyfriend before marriage and thinks there won’t be doubt. I’m shocked her parents would even support her with running away. It’s a disgrace that they had to do her janaza and then she turns up.
Deebu kuch ziada over ho rahi
Dr Numair is fictional man
He is infertile, its not mean he did his daughter,s DNA no daubt its unbearable for Andaleeb
Bakwash drama😂😂😂
Kia fazool loog bol rhy ghlti huii h numair say deebu ko bolain jo shaadi k bad chawal mari us nay or jo numair ki report h us ki waja say yeh sub hua
Andalib ko apny karnamy bhul gaye hain jesy bari pak thi shadi se pehly larky se milti thi batain krti thi or ab numair se bhi galti hogai numair ne bhi to maf kr diya tha
Andleeb pagal hogayi ab
Kisi nae shehr me nai jaga jakr gum hona chahti Hun, this dialogue is soo close to me even I think exactly same... Whenever I get upset with the problems that I cannot handle............!
Fazool drama fazool dialog  Bus watching only for whaj
Andaleeb hi pagal hai asal
Happy for zara❤
Aik immature pagal larki ny sary khandan ko pareshan kr k rakh dia
Kisy ne ye pucha hi nahin ke agar bap nahin ban sakte to phir ye kahan ayi beti aur kehta mene riport nahin li pagal
Whts wrong with this carecter Andaleeb...real example of selfish women a bad mother also a bad daughter
Kia seen a jb bap nai bn sakta tu bachi kesy o gai mjy tu yh smj ni aa ri
Andleeb ko APNA waqt Bhool gya hai JB khud Kisi k ishq mein Pagal thi
Bakwaas
Who noticed tatoo on the hand of Numair uncle   Likha hua h (papaji)
What a foolish girl. Isliye Kam umar ladka ho ya ladki shaadi jald baazi me nahi karani chaiye. But ye deebu day1 sey irritating aur khudparast hai. Khud itni choti beti ko chordke chalice gayi. Tab nahi khayal aya Maa honey ka. What a bullshit turn of events.
Kya bakwas story hai,....most irritating character andaleeb..,,.
Bekaar kr dia kuch accha nhi lg rha h
Jo log andaleeb ko glt bol rahe h main definitely bol skti hu ki wo log self respect ko upar nh rakhte
Boor huggaya bs next epi khatm karodo😂😂
Good bye not interested in last episode 😂😂
Drama was good in the begining ...now its a shit dont want to see Andaleeb character in this serial now🙄
Kya izzat wakaar of Andaleeb jo shadi ke din suiside attemp karti hai ...pyar kisi aur se shadi kisi aur se ....Numair is the only person who supported her all her stupid activities ....she is behaving as if Naik Perveen Masoom ladki ....what she was when she married Numaair.. not even proper educated  ...too much ego and kiddish behaviour ....best character in this serial is Zara
Omg what a class apart that Dr. Sameer was ❤
Andaleeb se ziada selfish maa mene aj tk ni dekhi.  Itna sa khyal ni isy apni beti ka.  Koi b yd dilata h k anadil ka to socho . Iss koi frk ni prta. Kese apni bachi ko koi maa xhor kr aise jaskti h. Selfish. Fuzul k bary bary dialogue apni nazron m gira dia etc etc
Da sa ghwal d yr😂😂
Andleeb took nonsense steps ...... Ajeeb storyline hai ...
Worst drama 👎🏼
Meri tara TikTok dekh ke kon kon aya he 😂
Is drame ko dekh kr aisa lgrha h k director thore se episodes k bd thak gya or bs socha ksi b trha aisa tesa complete kro.. mtlb kuch b hota jarha h betuka sa
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
Worst character andleep
Why Andaleeb's parents are not telling her that Numair believed that he can't be a father.That is why he doubted her
Boring ho gaya😂
Hate Andaleeb character 👎
Yaar who is writing these dramas. So out of touch from reality.
Andaleeb parents are crazy
The whole serial is trash now
Great episode......especiaLLy for Zaraaaa......But Numair or AndLepe ka bhi patch up hona chahiye They Both ShouLd ApoLogize with eachother...........they shouLd be Gathered again for Their Daughter AnaadiL..........bcz a Great Mother can Sarrifice Her ego n every thing For her Kid......❤❤❤❤😂
Andleep is like matches box🤣
Bad ending
Kitna over react kia hai is  deepboooo ny...
DNA report kyn nahi dekh leta Numair Allah ki taruf say miracle bhi tu ho sukta hay Aakhir bucha hay kis ka ??????
Itna ghatya drama Andaleeb ko koi ek thappar to marta  Khudi gae thi ghar se marnay 😂😂😂
4 5 saal bad wapis ati to lgta bi nai andleeb he. 3 mah bad aker keh re bht kuch delh lia life me 😂
Debu k zid..ufff jan k debu over ho rhi h
Andaleeb is such a pathetic character
Dekha jae to numair ne galat kuch ni kia usko doubt tha and dibu ka affair tha phle se to obviously bas usko phle btadena chahie tha but its a drama
Andaleep❌= problem creator✅
Its not too much is sy b brh k baty sunna pparhti ha reall life me ye to kuch b naai it was  just a test womens suffer a lots in susral hr roz nai bat nikal ati esi esi baty jo kbi suni b na ho susral suna deta
Finally Zara ko uske wala sahiii bnda dila rhe hain😂
Andleeb is the most irritating and pagal character ever
Andaleeb ab zada hi darma kr rhi ha
yeh andleeb mar hee jatti to zada behtar drama hota🤨
Good😢
Ajeeb maa hy ek  baar bhi beti ka nahi poocha... na kuch sunna na samajhna.
Andaleep is weird, first she claimed to love moiz, then she ruthlessly denied to him. Then again she claimed to love numair and now she's behaving ruthless with him that she forgotten him, she don't love him anymore.
😢
এতদিন ঠিকঠাক ছিল।  এখন কেমন জানি   বেশি বেশি লাগতাছে।
What a ridiculous episode, its indescribable!! Zara off to the US (no one to see her off😮????!)and conveniently her old 'handsome' pal joins her. Then Deebu, less said about her the better! When numair forgave her suicide stunt on her wedding night, it's her turn now to forgive him. But I guess they have to overdramatize them coming back together, thats why the baby has pneumonia. What happened to the writers of the show, either they got bored, or lost interest or lost the script. Honestly all of them need serious help! Good that the only sane one Zara left or she would turn like the rest of them. But even her exit was so disappointing!!! Very very poorly done episodes from the past few weeks, and its only going down further.
Andleep so irritating
Worst character and worst logics of Deebu
Krsi orat ha bachi ki b parwa nhi .kirdar mazi k konsa acha tha
Andleez zero bati zero maa
Kasi maa h
Love you 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
How hypocrisy andlleb did where was her izzat and waqar when she loved someone else and did sucide in her big day sick girl
Kya bkwas episode hy chapairain mary bnda andleeb ko
7:39 chlu g ye gae zara with new handsome doc to dallas a happy end f9r her i guess
Kuch bhi mtlb 😂
Andaleep is one of the worst characters I have seen.
Deebu lanti apni daffa ka bhool gyi h 2 no larki
I want friend like zara ❤
It is such a stupid drama I don't want to watch it...
Ya drama bata rha ha k jo girls intervenor ho jti ha . Wo bhool jti ha k unky bachy ha . Wo compromise ki bajah ghar kharab krna important smjhti ha.  Andleeb bhool rhi ha k numair ny kitna support kia . Usny ksi or lrky k kya suside ki . Agr koi or lrka hota to usi time divorce dy dta . Lkin usny understand kia . Ab ya selfish ho gai ha
Kiya bakwass story hai acche actor aur actress lekar logo ko bore karna to inse seekho 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 wah! Hatf off aage se esa drama mat likhna bhaiii
Andaleeb k sath kuch hua nhi h but she is overreacting , so irritating character
Comment section is more interesting than drama😂😂😂
Andaleeb nebht over react kia hai😮
Deebu is acting like she has been the purest woman in lifetime. She needs to forgive him!! No one is perfect. Doubts are natural. Specially when there's a reason. I don't like her at all now
4:00 numair ke bazu par tattoo dekho "papa gi"😅
Nice
Andaleeb over acting kar ri h
Now this drama is boring
worst character debu
Numair has played the role of a Doctor so well .. he looks like a Doctor from England..in this drama .” Jaffa “
😵‍💫🤯🤮😡🤡🥱
Jb andleeb na ik larka ka liye zehar kha liya tha tb numair na us ko itna support kia jab us sa ghalti hogai tu zaida over acting karna shuruh ho gai ha
Numair ki galti nhi h koi bhi hota to DNA test he karwata choti baat nahi hai ye
Khud deebu ne shadi wli raat zehr khaa lia tha tb numair e tha usa support krne wla ab us bechare p ay tu uski sun e ni re😩😩
If nyumer can't be a father then who's the father of anadil😮
Agr huesband or wife mn sy koi estabel ho jaay to phir kisi k smjhanat pr bi nhn mantay or ego dikhanay lagtay han
Is drame ki sbse damdar character jara ka h Andilip ne hi jara ko bdduaa di thi jb uski sadi jbrdasti numair se ho rhi thi  Andilip very bad character in this drama
Numair ka reaction q ne dekhya jab use deebu ka pta chala k she is alive? Kch scenes bilkul e chawal mari v ha
Ik do seen ha bs ik hafte Mai bekar kr diya drame ko 🤬
Aaavy hj andleeb dramy kr RI ha ...itni bri bat ni jitna reacht kia is na...
Kis nay kaha tha k sheher chore k jao.apnay ghar rehty .apnay maa baap k sath.
Andlip kuch zeyada over dikha rehain ha pehle epni kherkatain dekhai .pore khandaan ko zalilkerwaya .nomair ne is ko izzard di
This drama become a boring 😢😢
End may dikhaye gaybk debu wapis numair k pass chali jaye ge.drama hay drama to keray gay
Jab numair anadil ko andaleeb ke bare me bata raha tha to rona a raha tha 😭🥺😔
Why didn't they tell deeboo about numair's comlex
Andleeb jaisi ladkiya kvi v achhi ma ny ban sakti ma to kya kuchh ny sehti h apni aulaad k liye..yaha to itna mohabbat karta h numair..lekin ye deebu na to achhi biwi bni or na hi maa😢
Numair nay isko kesaybor kis terha support kia sbki mukhalfat k bawajood.isk past ko kabhi nahi repeat kia
Numair is acting like a 50 year old uncle
Andaleeb is immature and had no sense of decision making ,from start to end. The only sensible character is zara.
Zara ny buht acha kiya out of country ja kr ❤
First time, the main character's story line is so pathetic.on the other hand side character story line is logical and good..
Sach mein na dekh sk rahy hain na chor sk rahy hain ye drama
Fav drama tha achay khasey dramey ka satyanas krdea h .itni fzool story drag krde h k dekhny ko b dil ni ab
स्टार्टिंग जितना शानदार था एंडिंग उतना ही बकवास
When end this drama??🙂
Numair is so unlucky to have such an immature wife
Sare drame ko kharab kr diya 😢
Numair hair patch
Shokhi ban rahi
This is too toxic, kindly finish with good ending 🧐
Andleeb bohaat jazzbati hy bohaat rational decision leti hy baar baar suicide jitni jldi muhabbat utni jldi naffratt and now story is really cringy and irritating it's too much,,, naumair had a valid reason nobody is angle, honestly i want naumair should divorce her, annoying
Drama kuch zada ho gya Andaleeb ki taraf se
Numair ki glti Dikh rhi h andleeb ko or khud jo mazi m itni galtiya ki h wo sb Bhul gyi h kmane lgi h to itna guroor Numair ne kitna sth diya h study se lekr moeez sb Kuch m
Yh numair debu ka.shohar kam papa ziada lag raha ha
2x pai dekhrhi hun itna boring krdia drama
Andaleeb is the craziest character, she makes one after another selfish decisions. I really despise this character. First she selfishly tries to leave her parents for another guy, then commits suicide, then leaves her daughter for a misunderstanding and now she is creating all this melodrama. This bandi doesn't deserve any relationships.
Zara said to numair she is going to USA for specialization then after she said to doctor Sameer she is also going to italics What a big blunder 😂😂😂😂😂
Pori pori episode skip kr k phir jo episode daikho osko bhe skip kr kr k uff total rubbish
andaleeb is acting so immature all she is saying "Mai na bhot takleefa jhali hai, bhot dard sa guzri ho" like man plese act a little logical!!
Itna immature character
Deebu ke maa baap bar bar yeh kyun keh rahe hain ke deebu ne bohat Kuch saha hai, apni beti se kyun nahi poochtay ke newborn baby ko chor kar kyun Gai, hamaray pass wapis as jati.
Debo is not doing good ye hr dafa jazbati ho jati hy or apni zindgi k galt faisly leti hy kehny ko to wo khod ko mature smjh rhi pr hy abhi b wesi😂
Deebu irritate kr rhe ha ab
19:32 bhyi bkwas kro usey sae bat btao kia bat hui tm logon ki numair se taa k deebu ki b aqal thikaney aye pr nai ak e rat lgayi hui hai 😖😖
Ye to moye moye hun gaya😂
Who is using skippppopiolgy  method during watching this drama😂😅😂😅
Andaleeb’s character is really silly at this point tbh. Her stance is understandable but she should remember her own past mistakes and how Numair supported her despite knowing nothing at all.
Flop kardiya drama
Every saas become toxic when bahu is in trouble 😅
Kya stupid drama ha
Andleep gurur me h paise kamane k
Hun ty wai Zara Sameer di ho gyi😂😂
Andleeb character bakwas ziddi hai
❤❤❤
Ic dramay k writer ki mental health b kch khas achi nahn lgrae.. Pathetic drama. Chewing gum krden icka nam
This is totally insane andaleeb is doing totally wrong numair was the one who forgive her when she committed suicide she needs to forgive him and she should give him a second chance
I used to watch this drama only for zara's character. My interest has gone when zara and hassen's topic was closed. Maturity is realised when you understand that Andaleb is the most red flag in this drama. She has a lot of flaws now she forgets everything .
Deebu is bewakuf 😂😂😂 pgl ko sence hi ni hai
Tw baap ha kn agr numair ni ha tw
Andleeb is going through postpartum depression. She needs therapy
Numairs behaviour was too good but suddenly he changed it
Andalip kuch zyada hi bol rahe hai
Zabar10 drama hain. ❤❤❤❤
Ripot kiun nahi liya nomair ne
Boaring drama
How could she be pregnant
Anadil ke kya mana hai koi jawab de
Kya zara ke liye aya hai
Andleeb ❤❤❤❤❤❤ so ciut
Zara Bahut achi ladki hai lakin hasband ne bahut zulm Kiya yar
👌👌👌👌
Andalip ko ab aisa nahi karna chahiye nomair ko apna Lena chahiye
Agar Andaleeb numair ko chor diya to hum drama nehi dekhenge ❤❤❤❤
Nomair andlip ak ho ge
Andaleeb's character just makes 0 sense rn.... Y is she becoming so Self-centred and forgetting her own Mistakes... she's acting like she never made a mistake 😑 which is rly annoying btw.
Really the makers of drama are crazy the starting of the drama was really good with lessons for domestic violence now the drama is getting boring day by day😢
Andaleeb ne galti ki thi toa numair ne bhi muaf kia tha abh apni Bari ayi toa kamzarfi dikha rhi andleeb I don’t like her behaviour at all
Zara is the only good character
Jab boriyaat ki akhiri ghantei baj jaye sirf tab yad ati ha is drama ki
Ahista Ahista nafrat hoti ja rhi ha is drama se
I fing Andaleeb extremely stupid and immature.Numair could explain everything to Zara but became dumb in front of Andaleeb. Very stupid episode.
Last me bongian hi bongian 😅
Enke momta kaha gaya ye toh serf khodgharzi kerte hain 😮😮😮
JB wapis he ana tha to gye he q ???
Worst character of the show: Andaleeb
andleep ko 3 4 chuparain purni chahyain
Dr Numair is right 👍👍
2x speed
Andalip ko apni soch ka khud pata nhi moiz se thode din alag hui to numair achche lagne laga aur ab zara se din numair se alag hui to mumair k liye mohabbat nhi rhi
Hassan Bachary ka kue qasoor tha
I am bangali and you??🙂🫵
Drama story  Starting - 🫰🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥    Ending - bakwas ,, irritating 🤡🤡,,
Agr andaleeb ny khula laini thi , tu itna bara😂 drama kue create kia .. baat jagny wala ..
Zara ko chaiye tha k Andleep ki sari galat fahmi dor kr k phr jati ..
Hasaan ka kia bna uska ilaj howa nai howa kia howa 🙂
❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Too surprised to see that they omitted the scenes where the mom meets the daughter after so long and the husbands reaction upon knowing that she is alive! They created such drama when they couldn’t find her but when she came back, no reactions?..
Debu tu buht behis nikli us ki galty hi Kya h numeer ki
Shyd kuch skip kr gyy hn..Numair ko ksy pta chla k andleeb zinda ha
Zara aur ahsan ke happy ending honi chaiye
Initially the serial was very good but now everything i find illogical
Axy khasy blockbuster dramy ka styaanas mar k rkh dia ....  Fzoooollll kr diaaaaaa😡😡😡
Plz tell us
Libas daikhy zra Pakistani actress ka
How many episodes are remain ?
Puray tabbar ko hi psychiatrist ki zarurat hai
Totally fool Andaleep
Andaleeb is such a rubbish character!  Totally insensible in all situations!  She left her breastfeeding child because Numair doubted her because of her actual affair!!???
Fuzool ending,,koi sense he nai bun raha tha,bus kuch b koi b dialogue, so stupidity
The height of stupidity is no one even tried to tell Andaleeb the reality. Her parents tried to make her understand but never told her the actual truth. She’s the most stupid character ever shown, bas faltu mai exaggerate kia jarha hai ab just for TRPs!
Boring 🤮
👍🏼🇮🇳🪔🇮🇳this is rollmodel drama based on realty present🇮🇳🪔🇮🇳👍🏼
This drama is belonging to tere bin
Well she keeps complaining that she's been through tough times but who told her to leave in the first place. She could have gone to her parents and told them  just like she's doing it now. I think she's guilty
Andleep ki over acting bakwas lakiyan to apna Ghar bchany k lye bht kch bardasht krti hain or esi larkyan Jo it a time Ghar Sy bahar guzar kr aai hon unhain Kon qabool krta h
Andaleeb jaisa immature ksii larki ko ni hona chahyeh
Andleep ki over acting bakwas lakiyan to apna Ghar bchany k lye bht kch bardasht krti hain or esi larkyan Jo it a time Ghar Sy bahar guzar kr aai hon unhain Kon qabool krta h
18:32 twist 🎉🎉
this serial is becoming worst day by day🤢🤮🤮
Kya natak bnaya 😂
I love this drama very nice and very good 👍😊
Hello Aslam alaikum 🤝
Andleep ab over react kr rhe hai ...osa apna past b yad Hona cheya
Hello hiiiiii and I blessed Allah pak apa logo ko hamasha Khush rakhe
Ekdam bakwas drama hee...full of toxicity
Andalib is not dng gud wit numair
Please make the drama's based on logic this is such a  melodrama where is her self respect when she eloped
Ab ye drama bakwas lagne lgane laga hai sorry friends😂😂
Hassan ka haal kiya hein bass 1bar dekha deti😢 wo toh gayab hi ho gya
Andleeb madem ab kush ziada e shokhi ho rhi hn, yeh to whi bt hui 900 chuhy kha k bili hajj ko chli, apny krtoot bhool gi hy k kesy krtooto k bd b numair ny accept kia mohbt ki
Thanks for 150 subscribers complete 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hud hogyi ha chichorpan ki Agr misunderstanding hogyi thi to madam sahiba ghr chor k hi dafa ho gyin... what nonsense? Achy khasy drama ka bera gark kr diya
Now i hate andleeb
Who is watching on 2x speed 😂😂
Andableeb keh rehi he ki woh apni bacchi ke liye aayi he magar ghar aaye huye itna din ho gya ekk bar v apni bacchi se milne ka dil nehi kiya usko. Jab pehli dafa bacchi ko numair ke maa ke sath dekha tha apni ghar me aate huye tab v unki aankho me apni baachi ke liye koyi emotion nehi dekhi humne. Andaleeb sirf apni ego ke wajah se aayi hein.
Jaffa is getting boring now
Boring series
Iss deboo ny mujhy tngg kr k rakh deya yar
Pakistani dramas me yahi ek baat nahi pasand aati k ye log talaq khula ko assan samajhte hain Aur isse bahut logon ko bhi galat  Sabaq hasil hota hai 😢
Andleeb ka ye character show ko brbaad krdia 😂
aisi ladkiya kya rishte nibhayengi
Drama mn kya dakhna cha rahy hn'... Adleeb very very Over react kar rhi ha.👎
Thanks
Nice to next
andalib ya kuch zaida nahi ho raha zaida nakhri na dakhwo ab tumhare jase maayien agr is dunya ma hoti tu sb bateyien ka barra ghreq hova hota
This is just got worse and worse as new episodes come out, from good its now trash nothing makes sense. Is it so difficult to let numair explain he couldnt have children till now andaleep isnt aware
Numair accepted andaleep at her worst but andaleep wants everything perfect
Kon kon India se dekh raha hai
Andaleeb Kuch zyada nehi kar Rahi hain🙁
Salon mein kaam karke she thinks she can run the world. I don’t understand why she’s not giving him one chance to explain his side of the story…also why didn’t her parents tell her about his infertility issue?!
now a days a new trend of dramas. As soon they coming to an end they becoming seriously crap
Issey better toh shak ko sach bana dein ye log.. phir kahanni dekhne waali ho sakti h ye toh irritating hogyai
Hassan pagaal pagaal 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hasn kha h 😢
Andaleef over react 😂
Zara and Numair is more sensible and understanding characters . I love this drama.feeling sad for ending of Jafaa.canada.
Strong women should not be portrayed as stupid and insensitive. Strength lies in flexibility and ability to be fair and firm not selfish and stubborn  Characterizations need to be upgraded
Suddenly a beautiful Drama turn into disaster why ?  Now rushing for packup
Andeleep is overreacting 😂
👍🏼
Deebu ke parents bhi kitne jahil type h , jisne bure waqt m saath diya ab usko kitna bura bhala keh rahe
Numair ko kaise pata chala ke deebu wapis aa gaye hai 🤔🤔🤔
I hate this drama , no story just  wast of time
Worst drama ever
Agar baap nae ban sakta tw anadil ks ki beti hai? 🤔
I love this drama ❤❤
Itni jaldi USA jarahi 😂idhar hum mar rahay hai mbbs BDS karny k baàd k apply karengy test pass karengy blah blah blah 😂  BTW today is my Convocation 🎓 ceremony 14/12/2024  Dental surgeon BDS ❤ RMI Peshawar Pakistan
Numair ka bacha nahi ho ga ..suspens
Ab drama fazool hota ja rha numair ny btany wali bat bus bivi ko hi ni btai baqi sab ko bta di 😂😂😂
We used to call hassan pagaal because of his childhood trauma..but Actual pagaals are. Andaleeb &Numair😂😂
Freaking toxically executing the daram
bakwas intehai😢
What a toxic character is Andaleeb! She is worse than a villan, only driven by her baseless and senseless ego! What kind of suffering has she gone through is beyond my understanding. I feel so sorry for Numair, my heart cried with him, it is so unfortunate that he loved such a toxic character, Andaleeb with his whole heart. I wish he finds peace and way forward to move on.
Andaleeb is being so unreasonable
Andleeb kuch ziyada hi jazbati ho rahi he, numer is andleeb sy acha he. Samjhdar he
😂😂😂😂
andleeb have some fault in her brain she didn't compromise
Accent of new man in is very decent.
Andaleep jyada kar rahi hai ab😢
Andaleef bakwas character
Abi tak ka sabse handsome bandha ab dikhaya hai
I can't fully support Andaleeb. She should understand numair pov also. He was not completely worng in his place. Such a selfish character Andaleeb is!! Even she doesn't try to meet her kid bcz of her ego. I am pretty sure that she won't be a good mother bcz it doesn't matter how much a woman hates her husband but she can't control herself to meet her kid. . And whats happening with the maker? Why they give less important to Numair and deebu's pair? They even didn't show the scene with emotions where Numair got to know that Andaleeb is alive!
Khulla laind se pehle to khul gii abb kiya khula🤣
Why andaleebs mother didn't tell that numair cannot be a father?
Drama download qqq ni ho raha??
I hate deepu.she is very stubborn,drama ke Shuru sy he aisa h kia usney .wo bhul gyi KY numair NY kitna acha kia uskliye
Andleep overreacted when nobody trusts her only numair support her,
Stupid drama
I think same persons should make relations with each other then they can understand each other and help each other in every sphere of life..
why deebu is overacting
Soooo nonsense drama , what is the meaning of this drama pure joke 💩🤡!!!!!! FULL WASTAGE OF TIME
اگر ایک شخص باپ نہیں بن  سکتا تو اسکی اولاد  کیسے ہوسکتی ہے یا یہ بتائیں کہ اس شخص کی  رپورٹ غلط تھی

Kia bekwas darama kr diya hai
Kia bekwas darama kr diya hai
Andaleeb is acting so stubborn, like a little child. She has forgotten what she did on the day she got married and how Numair supported her and saved her and her family from shame.
Deepu. Umm she chose to go out alone into the world and is complaining about what she had to go through. Make sense💁🏽‍♀️
Andaleeb is showing the most immature attitude towards Numair...Ok...He did wrong to her but he is guilty...he is accepting his mistakes and he has trauma and his reaction was obvious. Andaleeb is just saying I'm a strong independent woman despite the fact that Numair made her and independent women by insisting her to complete her studies. Everyone left her even her own parents, only numair stood by her side. Contrary to this, Zara is really an independent and strong woman, she literally gave chances to his husband...and andaleeb isn't ready to give a single chance...she must be guilty for her past behaviour i.e. she took pill on her wedding night, then she left her daughter and parents without even realising that how could they survive without her? She is so immature and pathetic.
Achchha hota agr andalib mar hi jati ..numair or zara ki shaadi ho jati n we get happy ending..
Ye andleeb itni zidi hai?pehly kisi or k pyar mai pagal the Numair ny respect de pyar dia sb kia esk ly educate kia or agr ab aik galti hue tu ye oako chorna chahti hai
Today is my birthday what I only need from you is 1.64 likes

Deebu axhe nhi h
Zara is already a specialist. She is gynaecologist. May be she want to pursue another specialty or may be it's a writing flaw
2x ki speed sy dakny waly like karen😂
Andaleeb overacting ki dukana
Andaleeb doesn't make sense
Drama is joke now
Indian drama se tang aakr pakistani drama dekhna shuru kiya tha,ab yaha bhi nuatanki chalne lagi
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hate andaleeb from the first this is tge reason, khud kuch v kare lekin dusra kare to muh fula leti h
Even if they seperate..I don't want andaleeb to raise anadil..The kid would learn good qualities like empathy,kindness,patience better from Numair rather than her..Andaleeb should grow up herself first before being capable enough to raise a child
Nice
So many unreasonable things keep on happening I feel like the writer has handed over her story to someone else to finish as soon as possible.
Dr Nomair  accepted Debo with her past n suicide attempt   look at Debo she saw one mistake DNA  she forgot all wat Dr Nomair did for Debo   she didnot even give him chance to tell or reveal wat  made him do DNA , any man in these circumstances with diagnosis n infertility   might doubt especially when wife with ex  studied or in contect   ,ok baby is miracle  , Debo thnkless she never cared for parents she broke their trust  she never thought about in laws their name fame not important for Debo ,she was she is still stupid mean selfish
Andleeb ekdum bht pak daman bn gai.. izzat e nafs b agai achanak se
Deebu is so selfish jab usne wo sab kiya tha tab i hate her now literally
Andaleeb do wrong
Pata nhi AJ kal Pakistan k writers ko Kiya huwa hy girls ko independent ko la ka kuch ziyada sensitive hogya hy iqtidar m b aisa huwa mehru na girls I dependence ki waha sa rafay ko chord diya or ab debu while numair is innocent such a wrost character debuu is 🤧
कोई हमे बता दो की ये सीरियल रोज रोज क्यो नही आता
Andaleeb is toxic character
Insta pe ekk reel dekhi thi tabse continuously watching this drama please don't drag this drama kuch v krke end krdo bakwas lg rha h ab
Plz zaraaa mat jao plz 🥺
Intehai ghatiya hai andleep
O please don't exaggerate this drama😮 its turning boring now....
अगर हमारे यहा होता तो किसी से इजाजत लेना नही पड़ता सीधे अपनी वाईफ के पास जाते है
andaleeb  ka character start se hi dheet hatdharam h
Over acting kr rai h yh debu
Mujhe koi Pakistani drama bataw love story
Jaffa kis kis ka favourite drama hai
Fazool drama
Ik bta den writer k ik asi ladki jis k pas talent naam ki koi cheez nhi thi. Achanak itni achi beaution ban gai k log apna parlour usko sounp rahe hain 😅. Ya tu ye cheez start se build up krte k wo ghr ki sab ladies ko beauty treatments deti. Ya khud he krti. Maaf krna beaution feald itni asan nhi koi bhi rah chalte krle
I think the reason Numair supported andaleeb when she initially tried suicide without judging her for having past relationships and marrying him hiding that fact is his sensibility and maturity to understand the inner turmoil the person holds rather than judging her actions and blaming her for causing him trouble.His personality is an extension of his profession as a Doctor to provide empathy...He expected same level of maturity from Andaleeb which she doesn't have..She isn't even ready to listen to him even when he tries to explain it.. That's why even now he is able to reveal his issue with Zaara than andaleeb as Zaara shows emotional intelligence which he couldn't find with andaleeb..Andaleeb should take a pause,listen his side of story before deciding anything atleast for the sake of that infant child..
Numairs fault is he should have told everyone before marriage
Oss shaks ki nfrt bhut dukh deti hai  jisse Aap Mohbbat Kre 😢😢😢 I felt That
Drame ka naash kr diya
Fazool ik dum fazool itna acha drama tha pehle bilawaja andleep ko bhaga diya phr bilawaja wapas le ae. Lambi kr rahi hain drama apna charm kho chuka hai.
Thanks for 50 subscribers 😢😢😢
drama ko drag mat kro andaleb🙂
Naimair deserve a decent girl not like andaleeb type
😅😮😮J😅😅😅😊😊
Ye jo andleeb hai jb inhone suicide attempt ki thi tb inko apni aur apne parents ki izzat ka koi khyal nhi tha.. Ab bht izzat yaad aarhi h.. Waah re waah👏👏👏
Na dekh sakty hain na choor sakty hain
Shadi Mubarak❤❤❤ rajab bhai or emaan bhabi❤❤
Jab numair baap nhi ban sakta to ye anadil kiski aulaad h bhai
Iss drame🤮🤢 se 100 guna acha Iqtidar drama hai.😂😂 Those who agree 👇
Andleepl galat thi to numair kitna sath diya ab andleep galt h
Andaleep ka character sab se zyada kharab hai is drama mein
Immature andleeb khud ko bht mature smj ri h😂🦶🏻
Kuchh jyada isko Ghar chhodane ki aadat hai😅 ham thode thode se baat ke liye Ghar chhodkar chale jana😅 flop serial
Why didn't deebu's parents tell her at the first chance about numair.... What am idiotic prolongation
Yah log ka setup Ho jaega To serial khatm ho jaega na jaldi😂
Turning the  Worst pakistani serial
I hate dibu ak choti c mistake py us bichary KO Chor rhi
Yar yeh seriyal to boring sa ho rah h
Andleeb kaise itne bade baatein kerti hai na to achi maa hai itne din huwai aaye huwai kabi chaha beti ko dekhai, aur itne izzat ke baat kerti hai to shadi ke phele raat jo kiya phr be numarai ne esko sab kai samne apnaya but she is disgusting women in ever drama she is immature character
Kya bakwas dikha raha.. Maker is like a fool. Numair ko kab khabar hui andleeb k aane ki aur uska reaction bhi nhi dikhay
Deepu zada hi over acting kr rahi he 🤔😤
Andalib😂 madam itna kuchh karke fir bhi vahi bhav Kha rahi hai kya serial banaa bhai itni bada akal ladki hai Bina reason jaane pahle Ghar chhodkar bhag Jana vah bhi newborn baby ko
Andeleep sadi or pyar krna dono mjaak samjh k rakha h 😏khudki galti tu vhul he gyi medam😏😏
Andleeb is a very selfish character. She doesn't care about anyone—not her parents, not her daughter—and only thinks about herself.
Mjhy sehar khan bht pasnd.mgr is drama me bht ajeeb role uska start se e
Dragging the drama for no reason 🙄
Andleeb is very wrong bcz she does not understand that numair stands with them when no one is with U and now numair needs andleeb ...andleeb KO ab numair KO b aik moqa Dena chahiy
andeleep toh asa notungi kr rha h jse woh dhud ki dhuli huee h ab toh mjhe andeleep k wajah s dekhne Dil nhi h 🤬
Completely ruined the entire drama
English English English,  pata nhi urdu drama dek ke English me comments kr ke log sabith kya krna chahte hen.  For a while, i felt myself in USA, the last words are only for those who don't understand urdu. 😂😂😂😂😂
any students here ❤❤❤😂😂??
Is drama ko khatm kro yr.. bht boring hogya h
Andleeb character and actor both bakwas
Dr sahab bade funny hai but 😂😂 serial mein sidhe banr hai😂
jafa drama be like... ye aisa zehar hai Jo na nigal sakte hain na ugal sakte hain 🙂
Bekar
Andaleeb's parents are so toxic from the beginning
Aryy ma tau skip skip krr dakhny wali hu ma ny Tau yah 5 mint m khtm krr Diya  Ab hasu 😅 ya rowuu 😢
Beti k bare me nhi soch rahe badi bani thi mamta wali
Plz end this now this drama is getting bored !!
My favourite drama  😊
Ok
Debu ke papa mummy ko  numair ke  papa nhi banne ki news kyu nahi batae
Kese orat hai jis ko apni beti ki fikar nahi. She didnt even bother to meet her daughter.
Nice dra😊
Bahut bakwas  kar diya hai ye drama
Andleep bhi kam nhi khud ko nhi dekhi
कितनी अच्छी मां है
Dr sameer is way too handsomeeee I can’t😭😭😭😭 Perfect match for zara🫶🏻
Accha khasa drama kharap kar diya...Both Numair and Deebu are red flag Period
Yaar 😮Is drama ka mujhee samajh nahi ata
Ak to ab Pakistani dramas my ye samj nhi ata ky larkia apny ghr sy gaib ho jati ha atni atni dar .Q?
Jaffa kis kis ka favourite drama hai 😊😊
Zara kis kis ki favourite hai 😊😊
Her ego📈
Whyy deebu dont listen numair side its hurt 😓
19:40 she will regret in this decision
Wtheck the drama is looking so fake  now when deebu went missing they must be crying and are mad in search for deebu but when she finally arrived numair has no hurry to meet her he is damn so chill and on the other hand he kept on saying he love her how would you justify like this??
This drama is not reality of society !
Classic example of ruining a good drama the scenes are so absurd makes no sense at all.....an highly educated person a doctor knowingly he can't have children married a young girl without telling her everything before marriage And the absurdity continues
Bakwas drama don't know why great actors like mohib n mawra act in this boring drama
I believe the writer has hired some young interns who write and she pays them.  The way the drama turned out seems the recent episodes are by an intern.
I have been loving this show too much ❤
Andaleeb needs to grow up now. Has she forgotten what she’s done so far? If her husband for any reason suspects her then he isn’t bad. It’s normal. However numair has apologised for it still. Andaleeb is just a spoilt brat who only thinks of herself
Where did writet send Hassan nd his Dadi,,disappeared 😅😂
Why they don't tell the truth to andleep😢
Ye depu k maa bap ka qcha role hq kbhi beti k kbhi damad k
To Tum Kyu ker rehi ho
Drama khatm hone ko aaya lekin majaal hai Andleeb mai thodi si bhi akal aayi ho … jaisi bewkuf pehle thi abhi b vaisi hi hai
Deeebu's character is very ego full yaar jb andleeb ka past numair na bhoola daya tha vo to is sy bari ghalti thii
12:59 stop moving Numair
Andleeb bs zyada overreact ho rha h tumne bhi kmi nhi chorri h

Pathetic drama story....pehlay andleeb bibi ko moeez c mohabbat thi...phir numair c hogai...phir us c bhi khatam ho Gai... Wah wah...Nikaah ki koi ehmiyat hi nahi he!!!! What is the moral??
Andleeb is not making sense literally... Ajeeb beywakoof
Boring
Buht bury halat main numair ny andaleeb ka sath dia.... Overacting band kray apni ... Numair ny koi ghalat kam nhi kia
Chalo Apne Shahar Kanha so ja apni beti ko Soch Leti Hai Ek Bar Aisi mata mandir ki paribhasha
Andleeb soo selfish
Couldn't believe Tumhen apni Har Khushi Dekhi thi Tum pahle Kisi Aur se shaadi ki hai vicharon Mein Tum per sorry yah samajhte Fir Bhi Tumhen Ghar Rakha Tumne Kya Kiya uske liye Khula chahie tum bahut Manush Ho Tum Na bahut badtamiz log lekin bahut Tumhare jaisa is my little mini favorite character of Duty bilkul Bhi Nahin Hai bechari Kumar ka Kasoor Kya Tha kids pahle Dekhti FIR use ladki Khula ka what is the operation Main Aisa Karta Main Usko Maar Dena Jaan Se abe padh Lena please my favourite actor abhi bhi main Tumhen Pasand Karti hun Main Kya Karun meri Bus so gai hai jitne acche Mujhe Tum lagti bhutni ki Jahar Lagti Ho
I think andaleeb react more than enough....  Now this drama becomes hating
Apni hurkatain bhool gae
Yaar kuch bhi
Toxic drama
Sahana aur Umeed ko itni serious way me dekhna is now wierd! Unke funny scenes are the best❤

bakwash serial
Just one word—— boring
Ma numair ko suport kar rahi hong🤝🏻
andaleep ghalat kar rahi hain numair ka sath😢
Andleeb very irritating or stupid character
Andleep kuch jayda ho kar rhi h. Numair ki bhi to kuch wajh thi
I think now this drama is nothing. Why andleeb forgot her own mistakes
andaleeb just being selfish here 🥲
This is from *Holy Bible* Book of MICAH, 5-2. The advent of Lord JESUS foretold some 2500 years before the virgin birth, *BUT YOU,BETHLEHEM EPHRATHAH, THROUGH YOU ARE LITTLE AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF JUDAH, YET OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH TO ME THE ONE TO BE RULER IN ISRAEL,WHOSE GOINGS FORTH ARE FROM OF OLD, FROM EVERLASTING* The last 6 words are enough for any believing Christian.
Ache khase drame ko mzaq bna k rakh dia. Aisa lg rha h start ki episodes kisi or ne likhi or direct ki thin or last ki kisi or ne ... Aaj k episode ki highlight honi chahiye thi k Numair ko Andaleeb k zinda hone ka pta chla or uska reaction ya samna or wohi main scene hi nhi tha episode m waah 👏👏🤦 ek to wese hi drame ka kachra kr dia hai upr se main highlights bhi nhi dali hui hen pta nhi konse nashe m the sb ye ending shoot krte hue
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Andaleeb is the main character and they have made the main character look the most foolish one 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Andaleeb was an immature kid then and now still !
Are koi drama name ka to  maan rkh lete , script poori likh kr drama shuru krna chahiye tha
Numair ko shadi se pehle ye baat clear krni chahiye thi k wo baap nhi ban skta...
Debo k parents yad dilaya osay k khud na kobsay karnamy injam diya ghr Mai Parents k rehty larko say milti thi
Andeleeb KO akaly ghomny Ki adat ha phaly moiz k Sath bhag Rahi thi phir itny month k liya ghr chor gai newborn ka bhi khayal nhe kia Dabo Ki konsi izat waqar parents Ki izat khak Mai mila di shohar bachi kochor k bhag gai Zara KO badouya di moiz k chakar Mai  Ban rahi bari izat waqar wali Esi larkiyo KO tori izat do esy hi chat py nachti
This is from the Book of MICAH, 5-2.

Please Zara ko bhi ending Mai happy dikhana sab KY Sath oss ko bhi dikhana please ending andleeb or Zara ki happy marriage life ko dikhaya ga please Zara ki Shaadi dikha Dena last episode ma please I'm very requested you
Now it's like feminism rules and regulation implemented for this drama, counterculture , it's destroyed our Muslim culture

Third class jazbati
Aache hai debu kro ab life njoy
Dibu jyada ovar ho rahi hai ,use btana chaiye ki numer ki riport ke bare me
Andalib kuchh jada hi nautanki kar rahi hai so boring
نہیں ہونے چاہیے اس طرح بے ادبی ہو تی ہے
Jafaa season 2 hona chahiye yaaar❤ plzzzzzzzzzz vote who wants???
in jafa they tried to compare two situations. Dr. zara was educated and highly independent. When she came across such brutal incidents in her life how she cope with and deal maturely without giving away her right of decision to anyone. She took every decision by herself. And that too, right decisions. On the other hand, debu couldn't get the basic education to survive in society by herself. when she faced harsh days, she did what she could do with her own resources. Even though she tried to live on her own. Tried to prove herself that she can also have preferences but her parents and everyone were still questioning her decisions. That's the difference of an educated and uneducated person's reaction when met with tradgy. It was a good watch .but things could be smoother and faster.
Bahut boaring ho gya ye drama 😢.. Sara intzaar krna fizool ho jata h ese episode dekh kr 😢😢
*The Holy Bible. Romans chapter 10- 8 صحیفہ کیا کہتا ہے ؟ “کلام تیرے سامنےہے تیرے منھ اور تیرے دل میں ہے۔” [b] یہ وہی ایمان کا کلام ہے جس کی ہم نے منادی کی ہے۔ 9 کہ اگر تو اپنے منھ سے اقرار کرے کہ“یسوع خداوند ہے” اور تو اپنے دل میں یہ ایمان لائے کہ خدا نے اسے مردوں میں سے زندہ کیا تو نجات پائیگا۔*
Todays one is bakwas
Debu Apni itni glti ki to thik numair ki bas 1 glti ke liye divorce de rhi h mtlbi ladki 😂😂
Suru m to story accha laga per ab to saza ho gaya hai
Wow
Overreacting deebu
Wow
Jab yb bap nahi bn sakta to bachi kis ki hy??????
andaleep ne tamasha bana ke rakha hai zindagi ko
Bakwaas show
Fazool character andaleeb,she totally  forgot her past.dar badar bhi apny shoq se hui khud hi,zyada hi over ho rahi hy
Exactly.deepu sahiba ki respect tb kahn thi jb ek larke k sath bhag khari hui thi r usk liye apne shohr k samne zehr kha lia tha...
The worst character is andaleeb 😡😡
Bil kul sahi bat h
Unchi dukan fike pakwaan, trailer me dikhaya kya tha aur drama nikala kya! Adhi script likhne ke baad writer bhul gaya story ka track kya tha..chaba chaba ke beswad chewing gum bana diya😑
I hate andaleeb Character kitni  selfish or ehsan faramosh h ye😢
Please happy ending 🎉
Deepu ab glt kr rhe ha bht glt
Andaleeb is acting sooo much ufff its going like indian dramaaa😂😂
What a loser drama this has become 😂
Deebu ka too much ho gaya hai. Mar he jaatee. 😅
Plz andalleb maan jao
Such a stuip story now
Pehle bhag gai for her kid and came back fr her kid ? Ajeeb lerki
Bakwas character andaleeb ka ho gaya hai ab  apne aap ko pata nai kya independent women smjhne lag gayi hai  Mujhe lag raha he ye abhi bhi moiz se connected hai   Numair sabse achha character hai bechara suffer hi kar raha he
Is drama ko khtam kar do
I agree with you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Deebu not once thinking abt her daughter is beyond me now. I get it as a new mom she may not have any motherly feeling towards her daughter the baby deserves a little thought.
Correct decision taken by Deepu
Kiya bakwas hy uy Ghar aisy ni chalty uy sab dramy hamari any wali nsal ko kiya bta rhy hy family aisy banti hy orat asi hoti hy
Perfectly new character add kiya hai..Zindagi m itne masle ho toh new kisi ache ko shamil karna chahye..
Please let the next episode be the last one. They are dragging it for no reason😢
Dr zara ko uska partner mil gya😍😂
Numair gave no reaction on knowing that deebu is still alive....   Numair's mother is acting like nothing has happened...  Anddd why on earth is nobody trying for andleeb and anadil's meetup
Guys support me please ❤🎉
Kia narzgi Mohbath ko hatam kar dethi hai 17:54
Mental health or independence k naam py kya dikha rahy hainnn
Maha bekaar drama....ye numair aur andaleeb ko jabardasti ghusa ke behaad boring kar diya hai drama ko

Andaleeb bahut overacting karra hi hae 😂uski kartutey bhul gayi hae ki usne kya kya kiya tha 😅ab ana agai hae use 😅avr kisi ki baat bhi nahi man rahi hae
21:00  Yallah itnay buray dialogue… Debu ki maan k dialogue tou bakwastreen hain. Aur unki performance tou nil bta nil hai.😩😩😩
How toxic she has become
Yr jafa Ka matlb ab SB sun ln ab k be rehmi,zulm o sitam,na insafi but deebu Jo kr ri Woh pyar hi h bs pyar me naraz hui or ab emotional ho k divorce wali harkatain kr ri taky numair osy jaldi manaye or ly k jye😅😂agr nae yaqeen Tu dakhna next episodes me deebu Zara si bat pe numair k pass wapis jye gi or divorce nae ho gi Tu ye jafa nae h q be rehmi etc me insan JB khta h divorce Tu phr divorce ly k rhta✌️🙌
Kisi ko mara hua samjh ne ke baad achanak wo saamne aajae to hairaan hua   jaata hai Dr.numair😂😂
Trying to make a story in this flop drama
Andaleeb ab jyada attitude dikha rhi h  Bhul gyi h ki jab khud harkat ki thi koi sath nhi tha to numair ne itna support kiya tha
I am watching this drama only for Sehar khan ❤❤❤
Beti ki izzat or wqaar waah andleeb parents
Deepu doing bakwas in this episode ...now this drama going to be boring
Very poorly executed episode.
Now I hate Andalib's character.
This drama is turning into severe headache. Nothing is making sense. Everyone knows in the end they will live together. Why making audience fool who can watch by skipping and does not believe in any baseless pathetic separation story.  No feeling
Lo new hero ki entry ho gayi😊.Dr jara gets dr samir
نمیر باپ نہیں بن سکتا تو پھر یہ بچی کسکی ہے۔۔۔۔

Deebu tum choti bachi ho kya...

Insaan me itne nakre nahi  hona chahiye  Andaleep. Now. She doing toomuch over acting  zyada hai andaleep. Jo kar  rahi. Hai.  Duniya.   Me. Har. Ladki.   Par. Aasar hoga. Koi. Ladki. Compromise. Nahi😂😂❤❤.  Karna.  Chahegi
Dr Numair nay baiti ko rula diya ye kesa laad tha 😅
Andleeb ghlt kr rhe hai
Strong independent women ban ne gaya tha.aur illogical & immature ho gayi.jab unhone galti ki numair man liya.ab numair ki ek galti ho gayi toh unke andhar self respect aa gayi.worst character🤮
andaleeb kon sa dohd ki dhuli thi,chakar chalaay hoay thay .ubb kon say izat aur waqar ki baat kr rahe ha
Can I buy all the episodes at one time ❤
Ager andaleeb ko numair ki galti itni jyada hi lagi hai to zra soche ke iska suicide iski galtia kitni maaf ki hai un logo ne numair ne kabhi gusse ka ek bol ni bola usko chorna to door ki baat or andaleeb bol rhi. Hai k wo apni beti ko palegi or usko sikhayegi kr smjhaute nhi krne chahiye achaaa isko pucho zra jab ghar se nikli thi tab kaha tha pyar beti ka tab un logo ne hi smbhala us bachi ko jab usko bde ho kr pta chlega kr meri maa mujhe chor ke chli gyi thi jis time pr bache ko sabse jyada jrurt hoti maa ki fir kya bolegi ye
Andleeb ka emotional dialogues are not matching her personality. I think she has forgotten how she used to be and how numair accepted her.
Andleeb ko ab apna time bhool gya....numair k Sath compromise krna chaheya...
Jb debu ny apny x k liye khudkshi ki koshesh ki numer ny maaf kr k sath dia ab khud ko dekho
Andalib is becoming irritating day by day
Debu zyada hi nakhre krti hai ab 🤣
Andleeb 💯% right
Samira fazal has managed to ruin this drama and Andleebs character beautifully
Zara aur dr. Sameer ka ab chakr chale ga😂
That "male gynecologist" story cracked me up! Really? Is that the best they could come up with?  Also, Andaleeb has turned to be such an immature brat. I guess she always was one. Numair's influence only kept her in check for a whole. How can she be so stubborn and unforgiving to a man who did so much for her. Typical entitled spoiled brat thinking only of herself, not her daughter, husband, parents.
❤️❤️❤️
Life Mai. 1st time main apny bary main sochna chahti houn .. I also want this 🥺🥺🥺
Tbh Andaleeb is pretty reasonable in her approach and her decision of divorce is right. Also having divorce to end the drama is much better than having a stupid situation where she has to go back to numair despite she her denial.  Now whatever happens i just wish this Ends soon , It's getting boring anyway now
Kiss kiss ne meem se mohabbat drama dekha 😊😊🙋🙋
😢😢😢😢
Andilip bohut buri or na samajh larki hei ...
Numair deserve better partner
Ye chati hai ki iski har galti maaf ho kisi aur se pyar kare aur kisi aur se shadi kare lekin ye us insan ki ek galti nahi maaf karegi jo isko kisi aur ka hote hue bhi usko apnya tha uska khayal rakha tha
BABAJI mehar karan beta. Very proud of u 😍
I like this new guy.  So cute.   Chalo dr Zara ka hero aagaya.
The his actor played by Numair needs to lose weight for his career n his own health.  😂
Logo ki burai mat dekho balki acchai dekho
Numair ne andaleeb ke bure waqt me uska sath diya aur andaleeb ne numair ke bure waqt me sath chorh diya
Ye andaleeb  apne faislo par pachtayegi last mai😂or fir alg drama suru achhe khase natak ki band mja Diya unhone🤣🤡
Andleep character is so irresponsible
How numair came to know that andaleeb is alive??
Deepu is dumb. lol who leaves a new born.
Zara character is good
Now andleep is doing too much yrr so boring now the title of this drama jafaaa proved now 😂😂😂😂
Izat waqar ki batain dekho kaisy Kr rhi .....JB apny maan bap or shohar ji izat rondhi thi tb
Debo is wrong all the time......from start and till now
She should leave that Numair
Andleep hi bdi nhi hori pure drame mi... Numir ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
I don't like sehar's serious character I like her childish and funny character 😢
😊
ye bhi sahi hai bhai ghalat bhi tum karo aur victim bhi tum ban rahe ho? why is everyone acting like its a small completely normal thing to accuse your wife of cheating and having someone else's child???? no matter what the reason, he was a doctor who is supposed to know miracles exist???
کیا فضول کردار بن چکی ہے یہ اندلیب۔ گھر چھوڑنے کی علطی اور اب حولہ لینے کی علطی۔ بنںد کرو میں ہاتھ جوڑتا ھوں😂😂
Arrat k pass 4 paisy kia aa jaien apny ap ko mazboot smanjhti hai,  Jb k wo ye bhool jati hai k mazbooti k liay bhi usy murd ki zarorat perti hai
Kmany lg gai h na tbi apni galtiyun bhool gai h  Is ka mtlb h k wo just is waqt ka intizar kr rai thi k kb numair koi galti kry aur jaan choot jay
Numair ko chahiye k apni test report mobile Pai andleeb ko bhaijia aor poochai k agar woh us ki jaga hoti toh kia kerti?
Thanks for 21 subscribers 😢😢😢😢😢
Numair ny isko hmysha achy sy rkha sb janty hoy b or ab iska so cold ego dekho
This drama is becoming boring type....
Andleef is really villain,apni kerni bhool gai,nikah ke baad dusre ladke ke liye neend ki golia kha li   khud ka kirdar gira hua hai aur dusro ko maaf kerne wali hoti kaun hai,kamane  ka koi sadhan nahi bhagii tab kiraya bhi nahibhar pa rahi thi, na padhi likhi,na naukri na koi income source,apne ma .ta pita ke bal per uchal rahi hai,khud ki koi haisiyat. Nahiaur attitude dikha rahi hai maa baap ke baad khane ke bhi lale pad jayenge.
Numair ny sirf ek ghalti ki hy kon say samjhotay kiay hn pehly jo ab itna tarap ri hy
Andleeb ko chaperon ki kami h😅😅😅
deebu's parents should get worst parents award
bakwas drama
Hain… ? Has the director lost some pages of the script? When and how does Umair find out she is not dead but Alive - the scene of Zara finding out Andaleeb is alive was a given 10 minutes, but the husband wanted to wrap up the drama and go home quickly!!😮
یہ رشتہ دیبو کے لیے بوجھ بن چکا ہے اور یہ ڈرامہ ہمارے لیے 😂، ستیاناس کر دیا ہے کہانی کا ۔ اور میڈیکل سائنس کی ایسی کی تیسی
Wo mar ke wapas aayi hai and log aise baat kar rhe hain jaise wo trip per gayi thi.
Izzat-o-waqar ka mazaq toh deepo nai khud shadi ki Raat bnaya tha. Us k parents usai q us ki galtiyon ka ahsas Nahin dilatai.
Uff! Too much beating around the bush..! Amidst all flowery Urdu dialogues, the content seems lost as no one speaks to Andaleeb about what actually has happened.. Makers might have wanted to show more tension between Numair and Deebu but couldn't come up with anything more potent (pun intended) for drama. Last two episodes were examples of petty things blowing out of proportions.. Usman Mukhtar might be the only reason why people will still continue to watch Jafaa.
Now boring
Andaleep zinda ho ker agaii or sb itney normal hn zara akeli airport chali gaii or zara ka ex husband ka kuch pata nhi h  Ajeeeb bakwas kerdya h drama or andaleep ka character young generation ko bohat mis guide karega matlb hamari islanic society m aesa kb hota h k lerki pehly zehar khaley phir shoher ka ghar chor ker bhag jae aesi lerki ko to susral walon ko pehli fursat m farigh kerna chahiye tha dono ki divorce hojae ye hi sahi h ye debo ki herkatain ghar basaney wali nhi hain
I totally u.stand Andaleeb's anger.....her pregnancy was doubted
aisa koi bhakwas drama no ser no pair
Boring drma hai... andaleeb behaviour is not justified ... apny kartoot yad nhu
In the first this drama is typically but on this point this show that Andleeb is not a good daughter, wife especially mother she completely disheartening in every relationship.May Allah show a right path who service such a life. I literally hate such a character.
Masyallah, the baby is soo adorable and the conversation is so heartfelt
Numair Mother his right 👍
Bakwas kerdya h drama ab to manhoos lagraha h ye
Is dramey ka selfish tareen character h debo zehar lagti h
Who is fan of Hazrat Muhammad
Ye drama nahi raayta hai,jldi sameto aur dafaa ho jao
Intresting nahi Raha suddenly andleeb aati something like that but not good this scene
I m so so so happy for zara
Kash k numair jaisy insan sach mein bhi hoty.. lekin wohi bat h na novels aur dramas sach nahi hoyy
Too much toxicity 🤢🥱
Now this drama is boring. I love to watch ‘Iqtidar’ drama. It’s so beautiful
bruh this show has become trash now
4:15 😢 Zindegi kase badal jate hai na pahele se bohut hi ajib hai ye Zindegi 😢😢
Physico debo
When did the the husband nimaor and SaaS find out that deebu is alive? I can't fins that part
Pagal debo
Ye to pahle bhi mohabbat nni karti thi jahr khayi thi pahla mohabbat ke liye lekin numair ne sab kuch bhul gya
Acters sab achy hn but direction and story is totally rubbish 😮
Itna thanda reaction😂 numair ka deebu ka zinda hony ka pta lgny pr😂
Middle class families ki betiyaan yeh andleeb se bhi kahi zyda aziyaton or takleefon ka saamna krna padhta h🥺😢💔💯🔥🔥🔥
Kyun khud bhut accha kari thi kya apne shadi k din
Ah ahhh! Deebu is breaking is heart piece by piece. 😭💔
Andaleeb is more immature than she was before. This is just an over reaction and it doesn't make sense at all. Numair accommodated her before and he's still suffering. He deserved a better loyal faithful woman.
Ab yaha har jaga sirf meri meri meri
😢😂
❤❤❤❤❤
It's kinda don't have basis
PIA does not go to Dallas USA 😅😅😅
Without any luggage Zara is going to US😂
Is drami ka matlab he kia tha🤔
Isss drama ka kuch vaise kaas nehi hai jo paile laga tha
Andaleeb was always childish and immature and still being immarure
Zara ny aaty hi deeboo ka nhi btaya strange jbky aisi situation mei to ye sabsy important bat honi chahiye thi k Andaleeb is back😂
😊😊😊😊
I don't know what's wrong with andaleep and numair full. Pagal
Ek yehi drama hai jiske ending hone ka intezar tha🙌finally ab dekhna nhi padega
Yes you all write
happy for zara ❤❤❤dr.sameer
Deebu overeating
Good
Numar aur andleeb vapas se mil jaye❤😊
Y   ldki   real  m        bhi   asi   hi   aggressive  Lgti  h  battammiz  💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
This drama is toooo dragging 😂... zabardasti ke faltu k scenes h ...script mei dum bhi nhi h ....😅 Are jaldi climax pe laao 😊
Andaleeb is really naive and she don’t understand life seriously .She attempted suicide on her wedding night and Numair helped her in all that process ,he handled the  situation so well ,he is a human being he is trying to explain he couldn’t become father that’s why he suspected her .Now Andleeb should remember what nice things he has done for her .Deebu ko koi zor şey slap lagaye 🤦‍♀️
No comment😮🤔?

Vote for 2 episodes in week
She's being selfish now.... She forgot how he excepted her and protected her
Same my condition Mera baby bhi 6 month ka mery husband k pass ha mujha bhi mery husband ny andleb ki tarhan mujhsy bewafai ki or ham door ho gay. ye sab reall bhi hota ha
Kis kis ko ye drama pura andar se rula diya 😢
Ye sab andleeb ke liye bahut muskil hai kyuki numair ne jo kiya tha vo galat tha par ab usko pachtawa ho raha hai toh andleeb ko usko ek mouka dena chahiye ab ye andleeb pehli wali nahi rahi ye toh koi aur hi ladki lag rahi thi
Andleeb khoid kon c doud ki doli hay 😂😂😂😂😂 Bol gaiii shaid
I hate debu esa kia hogya hai usky sth apni harkaty bhool gai hai kia wo?? Apny greban mai jhanky pehly 🤪
Actress fazool hai is serial mai
Debu's mom is really really toxic
What a waste of time 😔
Allah pak sub ko sakoon dy
Dr Smeeer is handsome 💙🙃
this drama is so disgusting
Andeleb apny sary karnamy bhol gai hai...isko to Hasan milna chahye tha ...petai kr kr k dimgh set kr dyta
زحمت اولاد
Yr bht mushkik hai happy ending likne. Chleo 2 ep our. Hai wo dekh le ta ha liken so buring  I think is main koi story bhty g hai 😢😢😢😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Zara or nimair ki dosti kitni achi h lucky logo ko milti h esi dosti
Ghtia ort bar bat py ghr chor k a jti h
Ye sb daramo may hota ha 1 lerki gher se chli jati ha aur wapis ane se  sb usko apna lety hn koi kuch nhi kehta na bachi lety hn us se
Bakwas darama
Shrm Ani chahy numair ki mom right hn
Apni beti k krdar ka ni pta
Bhaii jab numair ne usko uske past ke saath accept kar liya to andlèeb use q nai accept kar rahi he andlèeb was doing wrong
Fazool lambaaa kr DYA draama
They totally disregard numair kindness.. All the hardship Debu has faced is because of her stupidity
andleeb totally hurt's NUMAIR I wish drama finish with happy ending
No one is dropping off Zara at the airport ..not even her parents  Very funny..she is their only child..
Writer ko tu thora sa common sense hona chahiye😂 ki story tu axha sa bnta/bnty
When in the drama he came to know that she is alive
Andalip bahut selfish ladhki h jab usne galti ki thi to numair sabse ladh kr usko ijjat di or ab wo uske galti pr itna nafrat
zara ny pehli dfa to nh apny baary me socha...
Jb ye bibi ka affair chl rha tha to numair ne yo khula nh li. Jb isne khud khushi ke koshish ki tb b khula nh li.
In logo me Divorce mtlb mazak 😅😅
Maturity is when you realize that Zara is the only sensible character🙂
Andaleeb kisne kaha tumse bhaag kar parlor pe mirror saf karo.Ab attitude show kartiho
Andaleeb's parents are beating around the bush & not talk about actual reason of Numair's dilemma. Andaleeb has become so much strong that she doesn't even want to see her baby. If you wanted to stretch this drama they can show Hasan's recovery.
Andaleeb k parents uski sunte bhi nhi hain or jb vo kuchh kar leti h to bad m rote hain 😂😂😂
Andleeb ny konsi himmat ki ha?
Haqeeqat se door draame
Awan drma h ya koe hal nh
Awan drma h ya koe hal nh
Andleeb k ghar wale sham m numair ko zaleel karte hai aur subah izzat de kar welcome karte hai 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kya bacho wala drama h jha lrkia muuh uthha k ght chor jati byn string bnny k lye bna kuch smjhy pta nh kya msg dyna chah rhy, bhr ki dunia kitni gair mehfoz h yh q nh dekhaty yh
Mujhy say ghalti ho Gai us say ghalti ho Gai what's nonsense yar😡
Faltu hogeya nhi dehkna
It's funny how everyone has totally overlooked or maybe forgotten about a few weeks old baby😮😂  This drama has fallen from Grace
Please ab is drama series ko band kar do!  Andleep mar gayi iska jimmedar Numair hai, ia baat ka tana diya jata raha lekin ab jo wapas aa gayi ye numair ko kyun nahi bataya ja raha! End this drama asap.
Ount re ount Teri kon si kal sehdi,ye andaleeb pe khoob fit ata hy.
Interesting Twist for Zara
why this drama still continue 😅😅
7.30 zara US jati hey our koyi usey see off karne nahi jata so funny 😂😂😂
This is a perfect example that when a woman get independent how she discard every emotion of such a loving guy despite of having a genuine reason, whereas, Numair at the toughest times stood with her.
Please koi smjha do numair baap nhi bn skta to ye baccha hai kiska???🤔🤔🤔
Amina aur hasan k khene per deukha .... kaash na manti.... waste of time....
Horrible drama .....
Feminist😁😁
Painful to even watch! How is this the same Jafa!! Sun mere dil, Jafa all drama stroyline became so useless! How did the writers even make these up😢
Buss Numair batanay kee koshish hee karta rahay….kabhee moun say phootay naheen kay reason Kiya tha DNA karwanay ka
tab aisa LG raha ghr ujarna sikha rhy
Koi maane chahe na maane drama tb tk acha th jbtk Hussain tha😂🤍
Only sensible character in this drama is zara .. . seriously main couple are trash😅
Rajab bhi love you❤❤❤
Andaleeb is too much 😡
Itni kya darar aa gyi yr...such a bullshit drama.😂
20 000 kamane wali bol rha hai mai ak majbut aurat hu😅😅
Or beti jo gar sy bhag rhi thi... Shadi waly din khodkhushi kar li
PIA flight Dallas nhi jati hai😂😂😂
Lo g andleeb ne Kia tough time dekha h 😂😂😂
Chalo ji ..numair ne andaleep ko apnaya tab jab usne kisi aur ke liye Marne ki koshish ki..ab numair se kya galati Hui ...ye to vaag khari hui
Deeboo is totally fazool......
Bilkul
Our o keya Joo numair apni ana kochal kar ke is say shadi kee
Just cheep and bkwas bkwas bkwas fzol drama
Anjali aap aapke bacchon ke Kaise Chola Jaate Hain
Chakker chlarhi thi to numair ne apnaya tumhe 😂
Zaraaa best..& my favourite ❤❤
Andleeb: meri izzat or waqar ka kya POV: Aa jao moiz aadhi raat ko chatt py....😂
Andleeb JB sy ai ak bar Beti ka ziker nhi Hua na Beti K liye Roi kbi  bs Apny syapy ko ro ri  Ager numair ny compromise Kia Tha AJ is ko b krna chaye Tha Kon. Maa apni Beti chor K jati AJ is ko dekh K lgta bilkul b fiker nhi is lerki ko Beti Ki ajeeb
Who wrote this NONSENSE DRAMA ...Andaleeb is highly egoistic CASE ....drama is pathetic... all blame to writer
Is drame Ka end krna kya chahte h ap log 😂
Who is writer of this drama
Andleeb's parents have no right to speak now; they were the ones who took the initiative to hurt her.
It feels like the last few episodes were written or directed in hurry. Nothing is making sense. But of course I will still watch it till last episode 😂😂
S❤❤t
sab andleep aru numair k bare mai soch rahe the 😭🛐but I'm behind moiz and andleep ...i think that':moiz will come and again' they patch up with andleep daughter "
Andaleep bhool gai k kiss tarah Numair ne isse affair hote huye accept kiya tha
Trisomy 21 ......or klinefelter syndrome ........trisomy 21 is tripple,x syndrome I guess
Jfa drama story  Before ❤❤❤ After 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Kya kiya hai Nomair ne, Andaleeb keh rahi hai maine jo saha he,maine jo saha he, what? Aam auraten iss se kahein zyada seh raheen hai aur rishta nibhati hein.
please sport me
Andaleep me to bahut attitude h numair so sad for him .
Jo ladki neech hoti h wo neech rehti h us bhaagi Hui ladki se shaadi karna numair ki sabse badi galati h
Bakwaas serial
Ab yeh drama boring hogya h khtm kro bae
Drag for no reason. Just tell the truth!
Thodi sharm kar lo islam ho badnam mat karo aur na hi Pakistan ko
Aap log aise drame bnate ho puri muslim kom ko bigad diya jan se aise drame banne lage hai tab se hi ladkiya bigad ne lagi talak sabse jiyda hone lagi ye aap apne paise kmane ne chakkar me islam ho badnam mat karo pakistaniyo kyuki aapke drame puri duniya me dekhe jate hai
Now this andaleeb is irritating me so much
Bakwas drama
Why Andaleeb's parents aren't telling her the damn truth ????!!!!!????????!!!!
The guy ( sameer ) choose for Zara is too handsome❤
Andaleb makes the drama irritating!
خدا کے لیے ختم کر دو
to all those saying that deebu is overrating do u guys even realize that numair questioned her character and any person with self respect would leave a person like numair  i get it that numair is not totally wrong its just that the way everyone is trying to convince deebu is not good it feels like they r trying to picture numair as the great guy and telling her to adjust its wrong instead they should make her understand about the situation with maturity and im sure she would understand but her points r so valid that girl should leave the place where she is not respected
Debu's character is like teen age non sense girls with heavy responsibilities
I hed andelip😅
Aurat jb ana pe aati ha to saamne ki gye wafadari sb bhul jaati ha numair suffer more than her
She is not thinking about her daughter. How come? This is so strange not even she wants to hold her. Where are her motherly instincts.
Andleeb is stupid. Hating her
Andleeb is stupid. Hating her
Don’t drag the drama by just adding nonsense reasoning  It will down the rating
Badtameez
I am hating deebu jb ezzat or waqar kahan tha jb roof per milrhi thi maa baap ko dhoka de k ghumti thi or bhagne jarahi thi or phir nind ki.goliyan, plz end this drama
27 mint andleep se ma na taklife sehi ha to ky numair na ka tha ghar chora ka jo ma baap ka ghar b ja sakti thi mashra ma asi orat jo shohar ka ghar se ja is ko badkirdar kaha jata ha drama ma olta dika ja raha ha orat ko barka ja raha ha
What rubbish andlipe words mazboot orat as b Kuch ni hova B's orat ko sika Raha ha ka CHOTI CHOTI Bata per talk lo  bakwas drama bana hi is li ha ka compromise mat karo talak lo
Oh god!! Ffs this andaleeb has been such a pain in the ass😂
bakwas tareen drama
What the hell is this? Has anyone from the team even watched this before uploading it? Like literally what the helllllllll is this?
Labi Kar rahen bahe ye Tu  itna achen husband Han  os ke  shet masla tan is Len Gaya d n taste karwana her koin achen karta
Andleeb bhol gai numair ne iske liye kya kuch nahi kiya.iska affair or boyfriend tak bardasht kiya.bekaar drama krdia ha bilkul
7:39 aab zara ki isey shadi krwayengey 😅
Aik dafa baat bhi suni
😅😂😂😅😅😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂
Aulaud ki khatir bohat kuch sehna parta hai
zara. ko dr banke bhi parna hain or mujhe parne se dar kyu lagti hain 😭
Bachay ko maa or bap ki dono ki zarrot Hoti hai when she grows and ask that where is my father what she will answer Kay beta mein Galat ti nah Kay apkay baba andleeb is right that agar aik insaan mein burai ho tu hazrron achi bhi Hoti hai
Edit kisnay kia yh? Scenes ider uder krdiye kya 😮😢 yh kya krdia dramay ka hal
Isko samaj ana chayie Kay he has severe condition before marriage that he can't become a dad she needs to understand that
She is right aurat ko bhi sacrifice Karna parta hai or mard ko bhi
Haad hain yaar! 😅
Andelep kitny,selfish he,jab khud ishk larai rahi thi,,tab humari or unki family kitne supports kiya, ab bool gai.mojbut orat my foot. 😡😡😡😡
Abb iss andleeb bibi ko apni bachi yaad a gai. Pehlye sooooo rahi thi kys.
You are dragging the drama unnecessarily!!
Ek minute main Pura episode dekh Lia main ne 😂
Meri himat Dekho mein nay poora episode dekh lia😂😂😂what a rubbish
No excitement reaction of numair after knowing andaleep is alive
Drama bakwas hi bna diya hai iss andkeeb bibi ki be wajah fazool zid ny. Or sab ko wajha pata chal gai per Kisi me zahmat nahi ki iss bibi ko ntanye ki. Ekhi BAAT pori episode mein sunn sunn ker BP shoot kerny laga tha🖐️🖐️
Andaleep is so irritating.. Boht he zyda drag karhy hain ab .fazool ki behss ., fazool ki zidd .. Apna waqt Bhool gye ky khud n Kiya Kiya kara tha usky bawajud numair n accept Kiya support Kiya har cheez Mai .. Uski reports theek nhi thi uska yeh shaak karna lazmi tha qk jesa andeleep apny ex boyfriend klye dewani thi uska yh shakh jaaiz tha .vo accept krrha hai maafi mangrha hai phr b fazool k attitude or maa baap ki Zindagi alag azaab baanie v thi..shadi Sy phly b shadi k bad b .unko sukhh nh milaaa iski waja sa .. So so irritating character
Ajeeb drama hai khud andaleeb kuch bhi karti rehti hai kabhi ghar chor dati hai kabhi khudkashi karne lagti hai...kabhi wapis nhi jana chahti...apni ek galati nazar nhi ati ..dosro k nak main dam diya howa hai
Running away frm home is not brave nor they should trach girls to do this instead face reality n if she wanted divorce then she should hv takn it at frst place
Yar new fortuner esay kab khrab hoti hn ... 😅
Mushkil tw nay khud ki apni zindagi Ghar say ja Kar
Andaleeb is out of mind..
Pakistan k dramas ko follow karein tw Pakistan k 99% couples divorce le Lein 😂
Larki khud ghurz he Hoti hay matlabi
Andleeb apna waqat apni galtian Bhool gae us waqat Mai numair nay sb k khelaf ja Kar andleeb ko support kia numair nay compromise nahi kia mohabbat ki is ehsaan faramosh larki say
Toxic toxic toxic
Well done 👍 andleep
Nimra Hassan or moiz toh gayab hi ho gaye😂😅
Too much toxic
Kya bakwas hai vai...Andaleeb ko koi batha kiyu nahi raha kih wo infertile tha.
Sehar khan is good at playing senseless character
The way he justified his mistakes❤
Haan khud baat sun K gae nhi thi... Dunya mein akeley...phir masoom bn jao K mujhy pr Kia jhela....touba Kia fazul.hrkat hai
I think they are portraying the issue in wrong way. If numair knew he cant become father his wife has all the right to know before even wedding. Why is it normal that he has been hiding such a big thing. Yehi ager lerki ho to yeh itna bara issue banaya jata.
Report to dakya
Jb baap ni ban sakta tu ay beti kas ki hai
akeli airport ja ri hamary tu idhar pora khandan chohrny ja raha hota
Plz  2 episodes in week plzzzz
"Time pass chal raha hai" esa lg raha hai. Sb itne relax kesy hen?  Story quick quick chalni chahye. Drama ki story nhi lg rhi ab.. daily soap ki story hogai hai..
Wasn't she already specialized in gyane??  And USMLE dia nhi aur USA ja rhi specialization Keliye 😂😂
Boring ho rha h bhtt ab andleeb ka Kuch ziyada he ho rha h bhaee B's end kro ab
Is time kon kon dekh raha h Like karen 😂...
This drama started so well with real issues but with weird twists it has gone so interesting.
It's been more then 7 months but dram not going to an end
Wait Numair is wearing Extension?????????????????????????????????????
Why is Andaleeb being so cruel?? Plz Andaleeb have some heart Andaleeb!!!!
esyy drama ni lagany chaye jis sy new genraction karab ho
ANADIL❤
andleeb ki kya izzat aur waqar adhi raat ko ghar pe yaar ko bulane wali maa baap ko chorh k bhagne ja rahee thi baap ne pakar liya collage mei khle amm yaar k sath bike pe ghomne wali izzat ka rona ro rahee tho
Andleeb ko apni izzat or Waqar tb yaad nh aya JB wo shadi wali rat zehar kha KY sogai thi us waqt sbke against jakay numair ne uska st dia even uske Apne ghr Waly usko rkhne k lye tayar nh thy tb numair tha Jo uske st khara tha..ab andleeb ko bs numair ki galti Nazar Ari h..
Andaleeb is not wrong tbh when you love someone you get hurt the most if they ever let you down. Its not a small thing to hide from uour partner for years... Numair should tell her the reason clearly why dragging it?
34:48 i would have totally supported her if she was just a wife BUT SHE IS A MOTHER FOR GOD's SAKE HAVE SOME COMMON SENSE WOMAN
Andaleeb kabhi bata k bahar nahi jati. Kiyun????
Andaleeb bilkol sahi play karai ha qk immutur girls do these
Andleeb ki Ghlti ha sari numair ne kya kch ni kiya us k liye
Now Deebu is over reacting. 😏😏😏
I always support women who stand upright for themselves and usually the dramas show the husabd will do jyadti and the wife forgives and take him bck but here Numair is a good person who did a mistake and is accepting it. Andaleeb is being immature and instead of having the communication and conversation she is acting extreme.
29:18 MAR HI JATI TOH ACHA THA 💀
21:02 TOH KIS NE KAHA THA AISE DAFA HOJAO AJEEB
How boring drama
Hairat ha andeleeb or osky parents bhol cya jab wo ghr say bhag rahi khudkushi karahi thi Moiz key pechay khowar thi Over horahi andeleeb  Wo involve thi moiz k sath jbi shak kia  Or debu konsa naik perven thi Jo itni over horahi Adhi rat KO.moiz k sath ghr Mai.ghum rahi parents Ki izat kbhi nhe rakhi  Ab nani ban gai
For your pet

Andaleeb  overreact kr rhi hai.. fazool ki zid hai.. numair ki bat to sun ly bhla
Nonsensical writing
Andaleeb ko thapparh mar k drama end kr dena chahea... Itny ziddi khud sar larki. Na maa bap usko Kuch Keh sakte Hain na shohar...
Andaleeb doesn't deserve to be a mother at all. periodt. i am not justifying numair's mistakes he doesn't deserve forgiveness at all but what andaleeb did to anadil is a sin. if she was my mother i would not have forgiven her ever.
Plzzzz mohobat ghumshuda meri season 2  plzzzzzz❤
Boring ho gya h khtm kro
Unable to understand who’s child is Anadil? If still Numair is saying that he can not become father.
kash yaa last episode hote
Andaleeb pagal hogyi hai
Over acting
Bas kar behen ab bohot hogya numair itna bhi galat nahi h mafi to di ja skti h
I don’t understand Andaleebs parents. Their daughter was already having affair and committed suicide. Numair was wrong to not communicate the whole thing to Andaleeb but their reaction is extreme
Such a childish behaviour of andleeb
Fazoll drama
Fazoollll ab end Kar do es serial Ka 35 minutes ki episode 9 minutes main Dekhi hai😏😏
I just don't like Andaleeb from the beginning aur aab to zaher lagti hai
Boring drama
23:44 😢
Ab na dekh sakty hain na Chot skty hain😢😢😢
such a shame and stupid script and story the girl who did sucide attempt at her first day of marriage than run from house os ke kaha ke izzat shukr kray ka itna acha banda mila hai ajeeb bakwas drama hai
I have a feeling Numair is not the father
Fazool drama. I was waiting k shayd koi twist ho. Mgr wohi andleeb or uski jahil harkaaat😂😂😂😂
Why is Numair beating about the bush? And not coming to the point
Numair ki koi ghlti ni 🥲💔 Andalleb is overreacting 🧐😐🤐
Dna test report need to see😂
Zyada over acting ha larki ke
Now suddenly she wants the daughter, pehle kyun chor ke gayee use.. What story has the writer written 😂😂😂. Pagal writer
Zara ko ni jai Jana chahye tha Numair akeela rh gya 💔🥲
اتنا اچھا شروع کر کے اتنا برا ڈرامہ کر دیتے ہو،لیکن کیسے کر لیتے ہو 😅
Writer is mentally sick😂
Andleeb ko apni he parri hoi ha beti ka koi ehsaas nai Ajeeb ma ha apni self respect ki prwa ha beti jay bhaarr ma
Andleeb ka koi qasoor nh wo apni jagha sahi hai kooi b larki apne upar aisa ilzam bardast nh krsakti ye fesla b sahi krrahi talaq ka qk ye toh nh janti thi numair bap nh ban sakta unk kirdar py dag deke acha nh kiya tha numair ny..😊😊
Deebu ab overacting ho rhi ha apne kartoot nhi yaad 😂
Andleeb is now overreacting😒
This deepu has forgotten how much Namur has supported her in her time of nonsense. It is his right to check. Her ego, her respect all abt her. Where is the love .
Pathetic episode....5 mint k baaat ko 40 minutes tuk ghaseeta hay ore natija phir bhi 0/0
Every thing aside! What was the point for Andaleeb to disappear and not to go to her parents after Numair hurt her and now insisting for khula while Numair accepted her woth her affair. Totally pointless pointless
Boring boring boring
Andaleeb's tone is too too bad
Damn girl Deebu..u are so majestically dumb😂
is drame ki to kuch smjh he ni aarhi....jb zara kisi ki bivi thi tb wo laarh k hubby se andleeb or moiz k problem solve krati thi or ab jb wo single ha free ha to andleeb ki life ko normal krne ki try krne ki bajay such tk batane ki zehmat ni ki.... or jo b ha numair ki bimari ya tension ak taraf but DNA test ka simple sa mtlb yei k us ne andleeb py doubt kia ic ki koi b or justification he ni ha ajeeb kar dia ha drame ko bht he zadaaaaa na bandaaa chor skta ha na dekhne ka dill kartaaa ha aj ki ep. m kuch thk na hoa to bus next ni dekhnaaaa  wese numair apna test b to dobara kara skta tha ak report se life ni chlti 2nd report karani chaiy balky ye jitna serious matter tha 10 alag hospitals or doctors ko consult krna chaiy tha bht he akward kr dia ha drame ko q k itni bari or serious bato k bad life time ak dosre ko saas ko susar ko o baki relatives ko face krna bht ajeeb ho jaata ha insan entertainment k liy drama dekhta ha m ne ye start kia tha k start m laga tha bht jolly sa drama ha but ab .....😞
What a nonsense story ......
Andleeb 4 din bahar reh ke ziada badtameez or shokhi ho gai hai 😡
5:00 Zara still don't forget Hassan i feel bad for her sametimes😢 though it's her mistake
Numair deserved someone better. So sad for him.
Andaleeb's tone is too too bad
Andleeb overacting ki dukan, numair ne tume with boyfriend accept kiya tha warna 1st day hi divorce de deta ke shaadi numair se or zeher kha liya moiz ke liye😢
😊❤
Andaleeb has forgotten how many mistakes Numair had forgiven of hers. Which man will tolerate a girl who had an affair with another guy and wanted to commit suicide for that guy. Utter bullshit. Pls have some sense in making stories... What bullshit is happening now.
Deebu is so over act  jb such pta chl gya Hy to phr usko bhi Kuch samjhna chahy na ky JHANSI KI RANI bni hoi Hy m y bhi krlon gin m wo bhi kr lon gin so non sense girl 😡😡😡😡😡
Andaleeb good for nothing
How a Nomair behaved when his bride showed her love for another person.  Nomair didn't say anything to Andleeb about the baby when he knew that he impotent. Yet the behaviour of Andleeb is obnoxious.  The premise of this story is absurd & not believable.
Ab fazool hogaya ye drama
Maa baap be like , beta AP jitni marzi begairati karein no issues , lakin miyan ny Halka sa shak Kiya is gunnah
End the drama,  fuzool
Deebu is good for nothing, she is over acting
What non sense acting is going on , seems like skip of reactions and statements, phir USS k Baad madam beebu is weird , apni harkatein are justified aur miyan ki galti is not
4:02 that “mat jao yaar” holds more emotions than anything he has said to deebu ever. Makers didn’t try hard enough on numair and deebu’s relations or maybe it’s just the actors who don’t suit each other
Zara suits with this doctor ❤
Andaleeb is so unrealistic,even her parents are so rude to her husband,they only think of her daighter
Apni mazri sy ja kr aa k inko.bol.rhi hy Allah apna bchoana bhol gai yah debu
Any indian here 🇮🇳
😊
Bas yr zabardasti drama ko rubber ki tarah strech kar rhe he debu is now wrong
Mujhe to lagtaa hai  DNA ka bhi kuch twist aayga baad me 😅
Maa sb se phle apne buche k pas jati hai r deebu is still sitting peacefully. How😮😮😮😮 writer ne yh kyaaaa likhaaa haiiiiiiii🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
This drama is now not worth watching. A wife /mother leaves her home secretly and then after few months comes back suddenly and trying to force her decisions upon everyone and everyone  accepts her, i mean Seriouslly...!!!
Zara is going to airport for abroad alone, even peacefulluly waiting in car like he is going on bus 😂😂😂 kuch sense ka  scebe to bna lete. Agr dctr ki entry krni hi thi to airport pr krdete tht must be a good entry! And deebu is back, this news must be a surprise for numair but no excitemnt like he already knows. Patheticccccc. Kuch scens me to acters bhi directr ki help krskte hn. Nonsense!
Andlib kitne maze se bacche ko chod k rhe rhi h or maa bolti mri beti ne bht bura tme guzara 😂😂😂😂😂
R kya mzboot ho k aa gai yah 6 months mn na kuch krti hy na r bchi k pas jati
Khatam kar do drama🙏
Andleeb overactin bchi ko b chonrny ka b gulit ni fzol writeing
Fzool story
Kya bkwas h reall me koi b maa apni beti apni olad ko es trha chor k nh jati . Or yeh dekho bewakofi k maa wapis b agayi or ek baar b apni olad se nh mili or na hi apni olad ko delhne ki wish ki tarpi us k liye sukoon se appni maa k pas reh rhi pagal pan. Ese duniya me koi maa nn hoti bhaee dramo me hoti hngi bs
Bakwas drama.
AISA e logo ka damag khrab kro drama bnaa kr k DNA test ku krwaya koi harj nai shak ho Sakta h
Deebu is pagal.... karachi jany k bajai apny ma baap k ghar ati
Entry of new munda😅😅😅
I think Andaleeb should at least listen to numair the way he burned himself in his pain she  should understands one thing he is not blaming herself
Itna Acha Start Liya Tha Ab Styanas KR K Rakh Di Hai Koi Drama Nhi Raha Koi Story Nhi Kuch B Nhi Hassan Ko B Theek KR Dety Kuch To Acha Btaty Andleeb Din ba Din Bewkoo Hoti Ja Rhi Hai Ajeeeb Han last Episode K Last Seen me SB Theek Kiye Ka Faida K Pehly Dmaagh Khraab Kiya Rakho Hr Waqat
The most nonsense and selfish character of this drama is Andaleeb 😒
Dil toh kar raha hai ek thappad lga du andaleep kooo zaher lag rhe h abhiii woh mujhee
Wese tu mai comment nhi karti lekin ye aik comment karne ka bohat dil kar rhi hai...talak lena miaa biwi ke liye ahsan hai lekin bich mai jiski zindegi kharab hoti hai woh baccha ki uska kiya kasoor hai bache ka aur agar talak lena hi hai tu baccha lene se pehle lo baad mai nhi aur aik baat shaadi ki jaldi jaldi bacha na lo socho aur phir decision karo
Ajeeb darma divorces hr dosry den suicides ki try keya psycho ho ap log ????
Andalib character is bakwas,too much stupidity...
Bhae zara ko see off karne k liye uske parents sath kiyun nahi gae??? 😂😂😂😂
this is the most cold reactions drama i have ever seen. they have no reaction on andalib death her come back, numair truama or when he get to know she is alive . WHAT IS THISSSS
This girl is still acting like a child.
Pura drama kharab ho gya hai borig lagta hai
Uff anadeel so cute baby

Jab numair n debu k parent k samny ye mana k wo baap nhi ban sakta to unko kam se kam ek thapad jarur lagana chahiye tha k shadi se pehly kyu nhi bataya..magar wo b ajeeb hai  kabi to kehty hai  numair n debu k sath acha nhi kiya to kabi numair beta numair beta😅😅
Zara going to the airport without her luggage 😂
Makers can turn a masterpiece into joke  and this drama is best example of that.
Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Sahab ki tasveer 🥺 1:28
Andleeb over ho Rahi hai 😖
NON SENSE!!!!!!!!!! 😑
Nice Step 1 and Step 2 Kubra’s diya is Kay bag hair to USA may medics ki field may dakhla nahi  milta  lol or specialization to 3 years ki house job yaanibresidency Kay baad  lol , but yay to drama hay hawas say door
Why is stupid Andaleeb talking about suffering, it was her stupid choice to leave her daughter behind. What an irresponsible mother, this drama is giving the wrong idea to young woman. Shame on the writers
Bakwas story
Ab is dramy ki happy ending vi ni chiyee...andleeb don't deserve DR.numair by by jafa
Irritating character - andaleeb 🤮🤮🤮
fazool drama
now debu is behaving like selfish girl
Chill guyss deebu k internship chalre h 😂 Kuch time moiz k pass toh kuch time numair k pass 😂😂😂 Seriously she is having a family, husband and a baby still behaving like a child. 🤡
It's sad how women these days only think that Divorce is the only solution. It's not even a big deal. Communication is so important in relationships, it was all a misunderstanding. But in the end the shes chosing a divorce? Itni si bat pe? Shak krlia tu kia hogya? Don't we have to clear ourselves? Lol andaleeb should feel grateful that numair chose her after knowing the fact that she was in a relationship with someone else. What is wrong with pakistani dramas? What exactly are they normalising?
Yar hassan ka be kuch sences aur hote is ke recovery ke
Andleeb kitni ajeeb h
Hasan tou bs badnaam hai , asal pagal tou deebu hai , Numair didn't deserve this 🤌🏻
Hate too much andleeb so immature  🤦🤦
kya bakwas hai ye fazool
Oh my god that actor is very favorite of mine... I saw him less on tv 7:03..  but he is so handsome ❤
Andleeb jaysi beti ALLAH kisi ko na day
Andleeb bht over acting kr ri h jb k wo apna past janti h
Their is no purpose of this drama
Pura episode skip krke dekhna pada isse axa ending kr do drama ki
The only good thing in drama is healthy bond of  friendship between zara and numair
Andaleeb mar hi jati tou acha thaaa😂😂👎👎
15:14 what about her izzat jab ghar se bhag rhi thi phir suicide commit kiya , such a toxic character, she doesn't want to forgive numair just for sake of her ego . Worst character.
Es sy ziada fazool drama mny AJ tak nhi Dekha 🤮
Jaffa nahi dafa karo ye drama
Andaleeb is so over dramatic
Jis jafa ko dekhna ka hum itna wait karte thy ab jafa ko na dekh sakta hain na chor sakta hain
ye kesi maaa hai chalo pehle bachi ko chor ker chali gui ab to mangva ley apni beti,,, maaa to aulad k bina adhi pagal ho jati hai, Deebu keh to rehi hai k vo bohat mature ho chuki hai,, mgr ab b lag nahi reha
Today is my birthday  🥳
SABSE ACHI DRAMA ME DR ZARA HI H❤
Andaleep says I'm mature but andaleep na phle mature thi na ab hai hmesha glt or bewakoof hi decision leti h aise hi sb cheez chor ke beti chor ke kaise ja skti h
Bakwas drama
Andaleeb yr khuda ka waasta star plus km dekha karo!!! Atleast numari ki baat to sunlo mera dil krta he screen me guss kr isko jhinjorh dou ajeeb itni melodrama .. 4 episodes hochuke aur abhi tk Skip kr kr k drama dekhna parh rha he .. numair ko nahi to humara hi kuch bhala krde Behan
Fazool ho tha ha ab ya drama
Usi k liye lerhi hu stand 🎉🎉
How bad mother Andaleeb is.Ayi hai itni der mai bhi apni beti se milne na ayi,na he dekhne ki baat ki
Kia bakwas story ho gai he, deebo boht khudgarz he
Why they crying on numair they forget the time when hold andaleeb hands
Anadeel k liye aayi h or av tk anadeel ko mili b nhi
Arayyyy tm bhi to giri thin sab  ki nazroon sy jab zehar khaya tha tab ye Numar hi tha jis ny support ki thi
Love you broo
Kya bakwas script hai 😂😂😂
Izzat o waqat kahan gi thi jab starting my chakkar chara raheen thi shadi k din zehar khaya tha... Bewaqoof acha sohar milgya ha to....
Why no one can tell andleeb about infertility. Please don't create misunderstanding between numair and andleeb
Or Numair k Dr dress pr Dr Ahmed likha  .. 🙂😂
To much over andaleeb😮😮
Ya debo be ajeb larki hy.reality ya Nahi hy.yaha Tu larkiya itna zulm sah rahi hy ulad ke khtir
Happy to see Zara 😍
So everyone knows the truth about numair ,not a single person telling andaleep what the heck yar
Andaleeb Apni aukat bhool gyi bhool gyi kse numaair ne uski izzat rkhi thi or ab 😅
I think Andaleep has become even more immature than before, I don’t blame her but she is not trying to understand Numair’s point of view at all, usne bhi to wedding night ko suicide attempt ki thi, numair ko apne or Moiz ke baray mai nahi bataya tha, dhoka to isne bhi diya tha, but numair ne andaleep ke imperfections ko accept kiya or unse mohabbat ki, lekin andaleep ko to numair ki perfections se mohabbat huyee thi, or imperfections se nafrat, perfect insan se mohabbat kerna konsi bari baat hai? Perfections se wo mohabbat kerta hai jisko apna faida dekhna ho, she is selfish
When is this drama ending, it's getting PATHETIC..
I Want k deebo ko ek rakh k lgaon😂
Please don't drag the drama. We want to see happy numair and andleeb
Nice drama 😀❤️❤️
Itna kyu kheech rahe ho drama yaar khatam kare
Rula diya bchi k samny ro k😂
Nobody's talking about his infertility issue..Laymans will never understand a medical issue...All of them seem soo uneducated...
5:42 I think numair is wearing Extension 😮
Andaleeb's character is incredibly annoying and confusing.
Andaleeps daughter is moiz daughtr or numairs daughter do plz reveal it
Bht bore hugya h ye drama ab
Zara ka kirdaar bhut accha hai
Numair ne debu ko DNA ki reason tu bataii hi nahi...?????
Andaleeb ne aj tak har decision he galat liya hai.suicide attempt, young age ma banna,Bhag jana apni bacchi chor k,abhi Numeir se separation ka decision.
Is the new doctor...the ex fiance of Aima Baig?
Nahi kya matlb numair ny aisa kya kya ha?????? Srf dna test kewaya baqi aisa knsa zulm kya ha is psycho pr... senseless story
Bakwas serial Ab khatam toh karo yaar
Itna bekar
😅
Andaleeb is the true representation of the fact that some people never mature up...
Andleeb behaves too much over and stupid 😢
Parlar ki safaei karky pata nahin kia kardia he
❤❤❤
Andaleeb ne bilkul theek kia tha k sab ko chor kr chali gai thi🙂 Aurat k liey shadi k baad zindagi or bhi mushkil ho jati he ....shohar apni marzi ka salok kerta he or Larki k khandan waley Larki ko hamesha adjust kerne ko kehte hen ...Larki k liey wapsi ka raasta bhi asan nahi hota Ye  society Larkion ko Q unki marzi  ki zindagi guzarne nahi detii😔 Please be kind 😭😭😭😭
Pehle to sas ko bara maa maa krti th ye ab sas ki shafqt tk bhool gai
*_`لوگوں کی باتوں کو دل پر مت لیا کریں۔ لوگ تو امرود کو بھی میٹھا ہونے کی شرط پر توڑتے ہیں، اور بعد میں نمک لگا لگا کر کھاتے ہیں۔`۔😁
Totally thuss expressions by numair after finding deebu alive Its like the writer gone out of mind after some episodes and dragged the drama without any sense
This show is proof that writers prepetually hate women or don't know how to write female characters. The sad thing is that it includes a good majority of female writers as well. Just look at how nonsensical they've made Deebu's character. It should have been Numair we as the audience should have disliked considering that not only did he hide his infertility from his wife but also suspected her and went far enough to get a DNA test on his child. Yet, it is Andaleeb we're disliking. The writers could have easily made a point that even the greenest flags can have flaws and make irredeemable mistakes. They could have shown a character journey but no... the whole story is an absolute mess.
Ghlt kr rhi h larki Yr Ab dikho os ny b to Iska love affair maaf kiya tha ye osko kuen nhi kr sakti maaf
Deebu ne jo khud kiya tha ,us k shohar ne to bohat saath dia tha ,ahsan framosh ,us waqat self respect aur parents  ki respect  kahanthi
Andaleebb bht selfish larki ha
Ab ye serial ko khatm karna chahiye  ab borin story lgti hain
Or ye Kaisi maa he Jo bachi ko chor k khud Amma k Ghar bethi he shohar se nafrat hogai Kya bachi se bhi hogai ajeeb namoona he
So andaleebs parents were ok with Numair hiding the fact that he wasn’t able to concieve?😂 not once did they ask him how could you do this to a girl?  Yes she had a baby, but what if she didn’t, he would let the world believe it’s her fault?😂
Such a stubborn character is andleeb
Numair Andaleeb ko divorce de hi de to accha hai...itni selfish ladki honi bhi nahi chahiye Numair ke zindagi me
Why numair getting so slim episode by episode 😂😂
Last episodes feels like rushed
This drama  First 🎉😊❤ Now😠😤🙄😒
23:26  sad moment😢
🇵🇰🇮🇳🕌🕋
Like seriously!!? Debu bol rahe hay k usne bohot kuch saha hay? Bht bewakuf ban gaye hay? Like seriously? Konsi dukh dia hay? Konsi bewakuf banaya? Shadi k pehle rat pay hi bf k liye suicide.  Ye to numair tha jisne usse bht support kia hay.. Like seriously!
Fuzul over acting esi koi badi bat hi nahin he apny galti itny jaldi bhool gari drama bekar hogaya he
Andaleeb zayada he attitude dekha ri
So stupid character of andaleeb...such a selfish lady
What kind of mother is Andaleeb,?  She didn’t yet met her child, it’s been two or three days she came back
Andleeb is doing bad with numair
Zehr lgri h andaleeb
Very bad acting deebo .no feeling of hardness shows in voice
Iska start jitna achcha tha beech m ye utna hi bkwas ho gya aur khtm bhi bkwas hokr hi rha h😂
Andleeb’s story is a bit strange but what I’m getting from it that she finally wants to make her decision for herself on her own. Everything was decided by others ,from if she would study or not, who is she would marry, if she would have a kid or not, if she would continue  education or not, if she would work or not .she’s finally independently making her decision and it’s totally her choice now if she feels comfortable living with that man or not. I think we should stop telling people to compromise. Let them decide that on their own if it’s worth compromising or not. Long term decisions / relationships are those that are consensual. Glad to see both Zara and Debu can make their own decisions as a individual as a human being . Trusting yourself with someone and feeling safe is a big deal.
Bilawaja ka over horai he andleeb ghalti to is se bhi hui thi phr bhi APNA to Lia tha isay numair ne
Bakwas
Drag kar Rahe he khaam kha drame ko faltu me
Deebu aik bar b apne bete se nahe mile kaise mother ha
Zara ko b kio mil gya ❤  izzat krne wala
Aik negative approach drama.
6:42 yaar itna handsome gynaecologist 😍😍😍
In which scene numair know andleeb is alive
Olad honai kai baad apna test karwana chahiayai tha.wrong story of drama.aik negative.
How can Andleeb forget about the kind behaviour of Numair, us ne itni brhi ghlti maf kr k us ka sth dia usko prhaya r ab madam keh ri ma mazboot lrhki hn Numair ko maaf ni kr skti blaa blaa🙄🙄
Unnecessarily dragging the story. At this point the drama should have been ended.
At this point andaleeb ki bhi Galti Nahin hai kyunki usse Kisi ne vajah batai hi Nahin ke numer ne DNA ki test kyon karvaya agar usse koi bata deta to vah yah nahin karti
Aik aadmi olad kai qabil na ho to wo theek bhi hosakta hai .aik doctor ko olad honai

Deebu overacting ki bhi Hadd hoti haii😅😅
Numair is a doctor. He should've re-do his test. Reports could be wrong.. But no he waited 9 months to find out if he is the father.😂
What her parents need to recommend is therapy. She is impulsive and emotional, poor girl may even have undiagnosed post partum depression. She left the house to go see the baby without even telling her family even though she knows that every time she steps out of the house now her parents must be terrified she won't come back.
*I And My Father Are One.* Lord Jesus
Andaleeb behaviour not good.... Koi esa nh karta.    Isay apni beti ka bh khyal nh. Hamesha apne baray m sochti h
Fazul Darama
Bs hogae financial strong khatam sb
Why anyone dont show mirror.selfish girl Character I have seen in my life.
Also why didnt andaleebs parents tell her about infertility part.. and most important why dr numair n oarents didnt further discuss how andaleeb got pregnant…  Intehaee fazool!
😊😊😊
Jis trha andleeb behave kr rhe lgta hai numair sacha hai k yeh beti numair ke ni hai or wo us sb sy bchny k lea drama kr rhe sara
Andeeplep ko koi 2 thpadd lga k smjhao ache se smjh ayega fr usko...
Over acting by andaleeb
What a stupid turn of events in jafaa.. ruined a perfectly good script  As for deebu... Independent aur strong k naam pe wo batameez ban k aye hai
Skip skip skip
Maturity is when you realize jaffa is a good story but ab writer or direct ko pta hi nhi kya krna hai ajeeb unrealistic h bhai jb sari duniya ko pta chal gya numair ki infertility ka sari duniya ko pta chal gya lekin jisko pta chalna chahiye usko koi nh bta rha 😂 bhai compromise compromise krny se acha tha ek bar bta do numair ki infertility ka but yeh na zara se hua na numair se na isk parents se ajeeb😂 Btw now I'm watching this only for zara nd Hassan agr Hassan ko end py b na dekhya na uski progress k wo mentally stable hua k nhi toh mujhe afsoos bht hoga k is dramy py apna time waste kia 😂 Hassan is also a leading character they shouldn't neglect him in the end 😭😭😭
Andaleb aj isat ki bt kr ri kl kdr thi jb zhr khai
Apna time sb bhul jaate h🥲
Kaisi maa hai Jo Bache ka soch bhi nhi Rahi sirf apna soch rhi boring se boring hote ja rha hai
Mawra is marvellous, rest story is soo faltu
Kyaa bkwaass krii ha re hai yrr gussa aa raha shchiii ab dekhh k
Andaleeb is the absolute worst character in this drama. How can a mother completely disregard her love for her newborn child? Absurd!
Numair’s mother knows exactly that Numair had infertility issues, and this is a betrayal, but she still has the audacity to bring up Andaleep’s past affair and suicide attempt? If Andaleep lied, Numair betrayed too, and she didn’t wanted Numair to confess about his fertility issues! what a hypocrite

This episode is directed by an inefficient AD, as were the last 6-7 episodes. Pls end it now. We’ve watched it, and now need to see it finished.

What a chay character andaleep.
Numair ne bhi debo ko apnaya tha isko boy friend hoty hoy bhi qabool kia debo bhi muaf kr skti hai
Kahen say lg he nai raha andleeb beti ki MAA hay or beti ki to isay parwa he nai ghlt he dikha rhe hain aurat apni ulaad k lie sab kuch bardasht kr skti hay par andleeb nay aik baar beti ko nai yad kia
I never comment but this drama has disappointed me.
andaleeb is so immature still uska background aur personality hi aise hai pehle ghar se bhag kar suicide karhe thi now again ghar se bhag gaye thi beti ko lekar bhi bhit insensitive Maa hai aur usko koi right nahi banta uski custody lenay ka Numair being a male single Parent jisne usko take care kiya and he's also a doctor as well usne hi manage kiya soo ANdaleeb has no right to claim her custody.
She never grew up.
Kaisi dost thi ,clear kiye bagher چلی gai
I don't know what the writer is trying to convey to us ??
Andaleeb hr waqt ghaib hi rehti hao 😂
Feelling bad for numair 🥺
How come no one is holding Andalib accountable for faking her death???? That's not only illegal but immoral and psychotic! This drama turned into absolute nonsense!
Numair and his mother is law right  No one perfect in life  🙃
Agree
Hi
I don’t want happy ending and Andelip is right here….
Andaleeb is soo selfish and stupid Numair ne apnay liye DNA karwaya tha not just kay usko doubt tha Andaleeb par ye baat koi kyun nahi karha ajeeb situation bana rahay sub Numair ko kah rahay kay uski ghaliti hai.
I swear the writer totally lost her mind ...m kya bkwas kr dia script ... Total rubbish ...
Time to stop watching this drama. Such a useless plot that even actors cannot act. Nadia Afghan has a very throaty and nasal tone which is very irritating. Andaleeb should be kicked out by everyone and go back to salon. Stupid scene about managing a salon because now there is no connection. A doctor deserves a more mature spouse and should be mature himself. Beginning to wonder if the baby is after all Moiz’s because no one has seen the DNA report yet.
Andleeb is behaving over Yaha Pakistan ma to 10 ma se 6 larkio k shoher in py shak krty lakin wo pher b in k sath rehti
Andaleeb is literally being so OVER - DRAMATIC, k like yaar mana k achaa nhi huwa but yaar Numair ka reason to VALID THAA awr usne Andaleeb ko hamesha bht achaa treat kiyaa haii to kyun Andaleeb usse nhi maaf kr saktiii jb usne Andaleeb ko kaafi dafa maaf kiya wa haiii. Awr ayk to mujhe ye dialogue "Mere nazron mein gira diya..." etc samajh nhi aa rha. Bhaiii konsiii izzat, tumne apniii izzat pehle kaafi tabah ki wi haii awr ab usne chotiii si galtiii kr diii to tumne itna bariii hangama bana diyaa wa haiii. Numair literally doesn't deserve Andaleeb; NOBODY DOESS. she is 21:35 awr kaafi dafa ye dialogue repeat kiya haii isne like OMG aapne kuch maheenon k liye suffer kiya haiii, log to puri zindagi ayse guzar dete haiii and pehle to ye ayk DRAMA haiii kyun k asal mein itnii achiii JOB maheenon mein nhii miltiii, ajeeb ghar se bahir nikliii, kuch time suffer kiyaa awr ab ayk kinda achiii job mil gayee haii awr baar baar boltiii ja rhiii haiii "I AM AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN". Agr abhiii ye contract khatam huwa na us bandiii k saath to phir sarak pe phnch jaooo giii 🤣🤣🤣
❤❤❤❤❤
Well dressed legendary actress, Laila Zubairi💙🧡💕💚
Jafaa ka intezar kar ne bale aur ek bhi episode mis na kar ne bale like kare ❤❤❤
Overacting boring sahar 😂😂😂😂 kuch bhi numair ne kaha tha ghr chor ke jao aur jana hi tha to apne maa baap ke pass jati kya tamasha lgaya h har ladki ye dekh ke aise hi strong bnna chahe gi choti choti baat pe ghr se bhaag jana astagfirullah female character 😢😢
Amazing drama
Aj me Aik mazboot aurat hn 😂to us waqt ap Kahan thi bibi jab ap mazboot orat nhi thi , Tâb kis ne support Kya tha apko 😂
Beti ki izzat huh !! Wo kesy aor sy ishq larhaye aor shak b naaa kren !! Kisy bewaqofo wale acript hai
Kon kon mere tarah 12.00 baje dekh raha hai 😂
Depu ke maa baap or zara ne ik baar bhi sach ni bola had hoti hai bhi ap bata do depu ko kya serial bnyege yeh log 🤨staring achi thi ending me yeh kya hii kr rhy hai had hai yr sara mza kirkara kr diya
Wahiyat chokri hai Andaleeb akele. Merne k liye chhod do usko
Nonsense girl
Bkwas
Andaleeb parents are like: maa bap hain hm deebu deebu ..First they forced her to marry number now they are forcing her to live with her... what kind of lesson we r giving
Andleep aaj bhi ziddi hai pehle bhi kise kinahi sunti thee aur aaj bhi wahi ker rahi hai
Yrr Hassan ko kyu nhi dikha rahe 😢😢
Andaleep is acting very childish. The relationship between husband and wife is very strong. Numair has also apologized, they should reconcile and make peace.
Hum tv produces toxic dramas with no logic 😅😅😅
Jafaa starting 🗿🗿 Jafaa now 🤡🤡
BEFORE I love this drama🥰 AFTER I hate this drama for his toxicity 🤡
Aur Andaleeb madam apne aap ko badi paak samajh rahi hai , jo suicide kar k apne character ki sabke saamne dhajjiya uda di aur kah rahi hai meri izzat nhi hai
They are talking about Numair galati but no one is saying why he did that. She is forgetting her own affair and how Numair let go off her galati. That's terrible. She is spoilt nothing else.
ageeb log hain ksm sy😂numair n andeleep k waldeen ko bta dya k m bap ni bn skta tha lkin ye log q ni bta rhy isy😂😂 hmri amii to jeena hram kr daiti ik hi bt br br bta k😂😂😂😂😂 fazool story bna di
Numeer ❤
Bkwaas drama
Andleeb is over reacting
Lol this drama is too much to digest.  Andaleep did you forget numair saved your life? Aap to shadi ki raat khudkhushi karne ja rahi thi.  Aur phir aapke apne Maa baap ne bhi keh dia tha tum hamare sath nai reh sakti ho, tab numair ne isko apne ghar me izzat se jaga di, apni Maa ke against ja kar.  Degree complete karwai, itna comfortable lifestyle dia, andaleep ke past ke sath usko accept bhi kia, driving tak sikhaai.  And what did andaleep do? Maana numair se Bari galti hui thi, par wo puch sakti thi, sensible insan ki tarah baat karti usse, 1 galti maaf nai kar sakti thi?  Par nai andaleep ne kya kia? Numair ke sath sath she left her daughter too, apne Maa baap ko bhi nai btaya ke me zinda hun..  Fazul me apni mout ka drama kia, dusre city ja ke parlors ki safai ki, and she was about to get forced into prostitution by that first parlor wali.  Luckily andaleep madam got partnership offer From another woman, jiski waja se thori independent hui hy... Usne khud hi itni struggle aur zillat ka raasta choose kia, aur ab araam se apne parents ke ghar reh rahi hy.  All actors are my favorite, sehar, usman, mawra, but the script is horrible, disgusting 🤐🤐
Arre bhai ye kya bna diya hai itne interesting drame ko...feels like indian drama, no logic and sense at all now
Beaib sirf Rab ke zaat hai. Hum sab khtakhar hain.
Thanks for uploading watching this drama because of sehar Khan 😊and usman mukhtar
😢😢😢 Alone isa qiu kia
Andaleeb or Numair ko mila doon plz..Happy Ending chaiye❤ Numair ko beta dena chaiye Andaleeb ko
deebu ka hal aik thpr hy jo maa ya bap ki taraf sy banta hy
Am I the only one who wants to know what happened to Hasan..is he cured or not.? It feels like they should have shown some proper ending to his story..
Kitna bakwas drama kar diya hai numair k expressions dukhaty uski maa k expressions dikhaty  jb andleeb ka pta chla...ajeeb he bakwas
Never really liked andaleebs character, she acted immature in every situation.. shown a very selfish character.. I know some things are hard to forgive but now there’s a child involved..
writer pagal he itna drama lambda q Kia pagal pehle hi khila ley leti khudkushi Ka drama q Kia pata Nahi writer pagal q hotel hn hahaha
From good script to shitty script
We can't blame andaleep and numair here, 💯both are right
Depu yada overacting kr rahi hai yr numir ne bhi toh maaf kiya tha voh bhi krde bcuz numair ki toh galti bhi nhi vichra 😢osne apni tension door krne ke liye kiya .. ap chnge kre roll depu ka etna overacting bhi acgi ni lgtiii
Episode done in 5 minutes 😂

Isko wapis moiz yad arha h shayad 😂😂😂
My goodness this drama is getting ridiculous day by day and andeleep is too much imature like what?? Irritating  Please don’t let down to your audience
I think Andaleeb ko Numair ko maaf kr dena chahiye aur happy ending honi chahiye.
😮 4:32
Andleeb kchuch zayada over ho rhi hai.. maaf he nhi kr rhi.. extremest debu vvv sad
This drama is getting boring and non sense
Kch zada he over batmeez ha andleeb doctor Umair na iska bura time ma iska sath diya or ya had hai😢
Numair ki acting bahot hi bakwas  ek flop hero hai.
_Andleeb tooo much overreact😂😂_
No tallaq only milap 😁
Fazool story he
Band karo ye drama
Numair ny itna supports kiya But andleeb forget everything why?why?😢
Bechari jitni qabil hain apni bachchi ko khak palengi
Kitna wahiyad concept h re.....bekar h bhai  faltu me dekha h drama
Talak or khula ko to khel bana rkha he pakistani dramas me
Andaleeb ko kaunsi bimaari ho gayi hai???  Faltu ki baaton ko stretch kar rahi. Kya hi story hai yaar ye. Maha bakwaas show😢😢😢
What is this bro 🙄what is deebu doing that's totally non sense
آب اور بھی دیکھا جاتا ہے یہ ڈراما کیسکو لگتا ہے وی لائک کریں
I don't know but i feel lack of emotions in acting ... Literally the cast is good the script is also average but the direction and acting is below standards ...
Fazul treem drama bakwas hero piyara na Hota hum na dekhty
Bhaga diya jata in logo ne bahut jhela andaleeb ko

Vote For Daily Episodes 😢❤😢
Keya bewaqoof bani ho hamesha munmani ki mere ghar tou koi bahu pahle din boy friend k chakker me khudkushi kerti tou dosre din hi talaq de ker
So as per Deebu darling she's been insulted and forgets hey own major sins. Her plans to elope and subsequent suicide. Turn a page back, shall we?
31:43 So Heartbreaking yaar 🥺  বাপ্পারাজের ফোনম্রে হেনা চলে গেলো ! 🤧
Is darmay ka maqsad pata ni Kya
This is too much…the drama is really annoying me…Firstly I don’t understand why Zara didn’t say anything to Andleeb regarding Nomair’s issue, then she didn’t even bother to tell Nomair that andleeb is back…and look at Andleeb who’s not listening to anyone and I guess her parents didn’t tell her the exact thing and then Nomair also couldn’t tell her the real reason behind his act….deebu is still the same stupid and impulsive girl, not mature enough yet…she’s still so stupid and her independence has increased her pride and confidence and she’s doing everything wrong again….i mean this is all so annoying!!!
Every situation every scene of this drama will sow the seeds of so called feminism in young girls minds ....
مهيب ميرزا أفضل ممثل
Log Bure nahi hote halaat Bure hote hain Jhuti Kahawat.  Log hi Bure hote hai💥
Deebu is behaving like totally no sense girl😅😂

In all this drama andileep is real pagal.... Hasan tho bichara tha
Mat karo andelp Aisa   Is harkat ki wajah sy Sayed Mai ab kabhi meri fevret nahi ban pao gi
anyone from saudi Arabia?
Or andalib ko numer ki past report k bare me bhi Pata hona chahiye
Baby ko numair ne sambhala tabhi jake parlour me kam karsati.. Aur ye kehrahi hai ki maine kitna kuch saha hai..aur ye kehe rahi hai mak bachi ko bhi sambhalungi... 😂😂pehele khud sambhal ja...
Aisa mat karo life me bahaut kuch huta hai par resta todna asan nahi hai
Boring drama end kro jati bhi andaleeb aur itne jaldi aa bhi jati bakwas story

Andleeb's character is very immature and foolish
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ থেংকিও 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The stupidest character in the serial in Andaleeb. From the start till the last episode, she has been this kiddish girl who never grew up.
Andleeb : irritating character
Deebu ko koi bol nhi rha hai ki q DNA test Kiya tha 😢
Andaleeb should listen to numair and  she should know the truth about numair
Hating andaleeb role now
Andaleeb Pagal hai pehlay Khud khushi ki or Numair ne sambhala abh Numair ne ek Mistake ki hai to Khula leing , Pagal larki hai bht ! isko Dramay c nikalo .. Numair is good boy..
Andaleeb ka over reaction, Numair ne bht sath diya to andaleeb k maa baap khush r Numair pe azmaish i to over reacted
Aur jis izzat aur waqar ki wjh se vo ye sb tamashe kr rhi h vo usse moiz k wqt yaad q nhi aai thi shadi ki raat zeher khate tym nhi aai thi izzat yaad?
Kia bakwas drama kr diya hy
Please herbal TV Fairy Tail season three 3 banaaiye
Baji ne khud jitny karnamy keye hai wo bhool gae. ye kia fazool tareqa hai
So who ask u to leave to leave the city anjalee
Andaleeb k parents pagal h kya puri reality to bta hi nhi rhe h use
Any Bangladeshi here ??? 😊
Jafaa Drama Expectations:😍👩‍❤️‍👨 Reality:💩🤡
Pta nahe andaleeb ne ek episode mai kitnee taklefee sahi hai 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😢😢😢
Such a boring drama...... Andaleep is so annoying & always acts like an immature victim.
Andleeb is doing wrong usa numair  ko ik chance Dena chia us na bi to dia tha
Andleeb is the most immature and dumbest character in the drama and she thinks she is standing for herself.Irony!!
Bokwas
Fazool lamba kea hua hy drama baqi kea reh gea hy latka latka kr maza hi khrab kr dety hain
Andaleep ka kuchh jyada over ho rha h itna payar karne wala husband Mila uske baad bhi iska drama khatam nhi hota h...heroin ka character blkl bhi koi khas nhi h isme.. faltu me drama kr rhi h haziyat bol bol kr ..
Girls should not have so much ego she choose to leave herself
How to get a job in US after doing specialisation in gynae from Pakistan. Dr Zara can u help other Pakistani gynaecologists regarding this? 😂
Nice drama❤
Boring ho gya h drama
28:37 They are like: Leu Leu ye bhi mere galti 🤣
Day by day the episode is getting boring
Gi blkul as hi ha
I support andaleep.... if hassan is wrong.... numair is also wrong... neither hassan can never justify his behavior... cause of his childhood trauma... nor numair... killing someone's love, trust belief... and seeking for an apology after realisation makes no sense...
Kashmiri wala like karo
Finally Zara is not alone
Andleeb pagal ha numair k bt tk nh suni😏
Main to ye drama west Bengal kolkata se dekh rhi hu..  Or ap lig😅😊
Fazoooooooooool drama
Very very stupid story
Andaleeb is so immature to be a mother.Nonsense toxicity
Itnaa ghatiya krr diyaa haa 😂
apni hrkatain bhool gagi hy andleeb
Andaleeb kuch zyada he natak kr rhi h...bhul gyi h apni kartutey 😅
Pkmkb...😂
Sub k pass iPhone mobile hn😅😅😅😅
Ya over ho rai h ab zyada shokhi ho rai h
How doctor zara was going to airport alone without any family member?? 😂 No one was actually going to drop her to airport.. strange 😂
Debuu ka.character start say hi thek nhe tha. shak tu banta tha
Andaleeb is reacting a lot. Apni sb gltiyan bhool gyi
Shadi ke baat bhi jab moiz ke liye goliya khaye thi tab kaha thi andeleep ki cearecter😅😡
Everyone is blaming andaleeb writer ne numair k character ko itna whitewash kiya ki andaleeb k charecter ko dikhaya hi nhi thik ...numair ne itni bdi glti ki ...vo jo koi wife nhi chahegi ki uska husband aisa kre..and reality main koi bhi wife divorce legii..because respect comes first..but here viewers saying ki numair ne kiya hi kya hai bs dna hi to krwaya...which is soo bad. Or ye writer ko numair ki glti ko justify krna tha isliye story or andaleeb ki aisi ki taisi krdi.
Jb numair baap ni ban skta to fir andleeb kiske bcchey ko numair ka naam de rhi h , uppr se ijjat aur vakar ki baat kr rhi h, aur agley ne dna test krva bhi lia to report dekhi kyu nhi 😂😂
Such a ungrateful character of this girl.
Moiz n andaleeb pls
Tan mann nilo neel ❤❤❤. Mim se mohabbat. ❤. Qarze jaan ..ek chubhan sir. 😢❤
This drama is getting stupider as each episode passes
Tattoo is haram...and Numair's actor is having it...too bad
Now andleeb is getting over
Andaleeb waqai me apne bachakaane behaviour ki wjh se 2 zindagi brbad kr rhi h apni beti ki b aur numair ki bhi
Mazay dar
Deebu ka overreact ho raha hai sabse bakwas acting lag rahi zara ka act hi perfect hai 🥲isay kahte hai baat ka batangar karna koi scenes hi nahi hai itne react ka 😒
Or to or ese kese maa ka charcter nibhaya beti anadil se mil hi nhi rhi... Director ko andaleeb or anadil ka to scene hi nhi rkha jese vo parnts ke samne aati he to anadil ko bhi dikhana chahiye .... Bht hi ajeeb he😮
Not it becomes most worst serial . Please end it
Nice drama🥰
Bht drag kardiya ab end krden
Dr sameer toh hot niklaa❤
Andleep khud kon si sahi harkty krti rahi ha shadi waly din sucide krrhi thi lrky k sath bhag rhi thi ajeeb bt ha
Andaleeb kis tarah ki maa h use apni beti ki yaad ya fikr nhi horhi itne tym bd WPS aai h frr bhi use zra b apni bachhi ka fikr nhi hui
Sabse badi nafsiyati mareez to andaleep hai...nanni se bachi ko chor gayi...wo bhi uske paas Jo use apni beti hi nhi samajhta tha ....apni ego ki wajah se 2 mahine ki bachi ki band baja di....Ghar chod dena koi option nhi hota...
17:00 Shahbagi Spotted 🤣

Numair ko kese or kb pta chala k andalip zinda hai????
Mazboot orat 😂😂😂
Ye zara ko to sb such btaya tha numair n... Zara ko jaty jaty sb such btana tha debo ko
Andaleeb you are  right 👍👌😊❤
Debu is behaving like she had to go to such a life because no one was supportive.  Everyone was supportive for her , but she chose to hurt everyone and pretend that she was dead.  So lame
Really boring yaar😌😌
In the beginning i appriciated the contant. Now, its totally illogical. Andleeb forgot that numair is the one who supported at the time of marriage. Rubbish.
I am indian
Numair kh raha me bap ni ban skta to koi poshta q ni ki fr wo bachi kis ki hy😮😢😅😅very funny
Hate deebooo
When nails grow we cut nails not fingers similarly when misunderstanding grow we should remove that not relations ..... 🙌

Is it me or anyone else also finds Numair’s walk funny😜
23:34 literally I cried 😢
I feel disheartening for Hassan..❤❤❤😢😢
Missing you Ayesha 🥺💔
Bhai do u guys even know  postpartum trauma... Numair ne andaleeb ki puri Pregnancy aur delivery uske baad kabhi uska saath hi nhi diya.... Socho how she must be feeling after realising ki esa numair ka reaction was bcuz he doubted her... Be in her place... I know numair isn't completely wrong but he should have told andaleeb abt his condition.... Nd whts wrong agar ek female ko divorce chahiye... What u guys want ek female bhale hi usko uska husband psnd nah ho but woh adjust kar le... Kyuki woh ladki.... This drama is perfect example dont rush for relationship nd Marriage... First a girl should study have a degree be financially independent uske baad she should think abt those thingss...
I am so angry on andaleeb's parents there are not telling that numair is infertile to be a father
Andalib to aese behave kar rhi h jese usne kuch galat kiya hi nhi.. wo bhul gai k Numair ne use kis situation me qubool kiya tha
Andaleeb to hasan se b zyada toxic nikli😂 pura character bigaad dia uska kuch b pagal chale khud gayi choti si bacchi ko chorke ane k bad bhi bechara numair leke aya n she still thinks numair is culprit
Numair ko PATA kb chla andleeb zinda ha
Andleeb❤
Correct
suzii vlogger ap har dramay ma apna comment lay kar kue a jati ha
Going to US for specialization is not that simple😂😂jahil log.

Kya fazool drama kr dya hai... Bs kro isy khtm kro
is drama ki wja sy mjy andleeb zehar lgny lg gi hi. bcz fazool ka logic hai gar sy janay wala. mry pas alfaz ni hain is intehai low standaard drama ka btany ka. koi larki gar sy bhaag jaey to kia society usy jeenay deti hai. andleeb k gar walon ny , r susral walon ny is bat ka bhi issue ni bnaya. mtlb pura drama hi fazool tareen hi. itna ghatia drama aj sy pehly ni dekha. pta ni likhta kon hi r agr koi esa ghatia drama likh b lta hai , to director r procedure koi weelay kisam ky log hain. aik aur chez i m a doctor. i know k USA may specialization esy hi ni hu jati, itna bara process hta hai, un k tough tareen exam pass krny hty hain , r phr bhi bht papar bailny party hain, phr ja k milti wahan specialisation.

7:39 this is so unrealistic. Zara is a beloved daughter and her parents are not seeing her off to the airport
😂
ye kya pagal hay andaleeb , stop this nonsense man ! I mean COME ON itni bhi koi bari baat nahi hui thi
Konsi izzat konsa waqaar pagal orat andleeb us ny tumhain kis haal main apnaya tha wo achhhai yaad nahi why she is not understanding his point
Pgl Hassan ❎ pgl andleep ✅
Andleep kaisi hai yarr ye apne sohwar ko nhi samajh saki aur numair Jo starting me kitna support kiya tha uske har ek galti ko najar andaaj kiya
Apni zindge me itna bkwas drama mny kbi nhi dakha
Jafa ki writer ne lgta last episodes Khalil ul qamar k influence me likhy hen..... So boring and senseless...
Very stupid drag episode.
Khatam kr do bus is dramy ko ab
Jafa is now boring 💤 🎉

Andalib itna over react kiu karti hai🙄 har bat pey khudki hi tw sunti hai suru sai, bekar drama
Khud jo affairs chlati phirti koi b nh qabool krta.. Sukr KRY k bht Acha husband Mila... Or Numair to khud bemmar tha
Now Andaleeb overreact
Andleeb ny glt kia
Sara qsoor andleeb ka h
Silly script now . They’ve spoiled the drama .
Hlan k itna sehny ki koi zrorat nhi thi andleeb ko usky maa baap strong thy bonding thi parents se
A big applause for Usman Mukhtar for performing the best scene in front of his daughter. I think he is one of the best actors in Pak showbiz industry. Usman I ❤ U. From india.
Ye drama dekhna punishment hai....khuda k liyay end kr do..ab bas hogai hai
Why numair most of the time wears skinny jeans
wort ever drama....  Worst & boring as well
Achhhy bhaly dramy ka satya naaas kr dya ha
Ek thpprr lgai Andleeb k sarri aql thikane a Jae gii
Deebu's character is  mess She was yelling  HER CHARACTER  She herself ruined her parents and husband respect and every time they forgive andaleeb.
Ye Andilip sasuri khuch jyada hi bhaw kha rhi hai,..
Zara America ja rahi hay  ya Islamabaad ? Koi Airport Tak bhi na gaya saath 😮 ya yakeen ho ga ki rashtay may koi Dr mil jayah ga woh bhi Dallas hi jata hoga aur nahi bhi to Zara ko dekhkar Dallas nikal padayga 😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
But wen did numair knew tat deepu was alive ? Tat shown in any episode ? I dont remember
I love this drama ❤
Andleeb have to decide if she has son or daughter.
Jafaa starting ❤️      Now🤦
عندلیب زیادہ شوخی بن رہی ہے دراصل حقیقت میں ایسا نہیں ھو تا
Jo shaks apni apni maa baap ki izzat aur apni izzat lutane pe tuli thi khudkhushi karke nuamair ne bacha li
Next episode
Khud ka nikah ki raat ka drama bhool gayi aur numair ka best sulooq bhula diya ...wao...n so many loop holes in today's episode...andaleeb ke aaney ka pata nahi laga numair ko but no shocking reaction...n overacting of andaleeb big mouth dialogue....no one is understanding how painful life numair suffered so he did the DNA ....yes he has done the mistake of not sharing with his wife n ddnt trust her....
Hasan ke sath kya hua
AUDIENCE be like 😂 Na dekh sakte hein; Na chor sakte hein 😅

Very boring drama now😢😢😢
Andleep is too changed us behaviour with parents and very uncarfull😢
Ye dunya hasi drama😢😢Bewafa😢😢🎉
Kash numair ne bhi divorce diya hota andaleeb ko uske affairs ka janne par iska dimag teekane atta
Andaleep over acting kr rahi hai
Jo mojhe subscribe nahi kiya jo exam me fail ho jayega
Jaffa serial ki ending kab hogiii yarrr bor ho gya serial❤😂😂
Bohut takleef uthayee 4 din pocha laga kiya liya aasman sar pe utha liya😂
Khud ishq pyar kr k agai, proudly dunia k samne bataya k she loves someone else. she should understand k is tarha k doubts aaskty hain is tarha k cases main. Then she left her new born for an year or something. Now she is back trying to be a boss ??    I mean such a stupid character andaleeb is !
Ghair ko chatt p bula k b izat waqar ki misaal qaim ki thi
Dipo bosri ki 😂😂😂

Bakwas bs ya saha ha wo saha ha😅 bahn ko apni bachi ko dhakny ka b Dil Nai kia😂
Befizool drama is drame ka koi logic hi nhi he na jane kb khtm hoga yr
Ab zara ja rhi h..  Fir Andaleeb  ko kon batayega  ki numair ki galti tha hi nhi
خلع یا طلاق تو ڈراموں میں ایسے دکھاتے ہیں جیسے ہنسی کھیل ہو کیا اسلام نے یہی سبق دیا ہے کہ برداشت کو ایک طرف رکھ دو اور خاص طور پر اولاد ہونے کے بعد اللہ کریم اللہ عقل دے اج کل کی عورتوں کو  اب ڈرامے میں رہا کیا ہے ختم کریں
Yar thk hh numair nay galt kia hh par uski bb itni galti nai hh deebu uski bat nai sun re
29:55 body double alert
Wao my favourite hero new doctor❤
I can't believe how immature andaleeb is! She's just being a feminist. Why she left her new born baby? Who told her to suffer? She's such a immature girl from the beginning.
Ab to pura indian serial ban gya
Jafar is my favourite drama❤❤❤❤❤❤
Main
Haasan sy zyda toh andeleeb pgl h 😂
Ye gi kinu the or eb ai kinu he ya jati na ya ati na 😂

👎👎👎irritating
Jo india se hai wo comment kare or reply de 😊💕😅
Baby h kiski Numair ki ya uske bf ki
Hamesha aurat kohi kiu samjhota karna padta hein har bar jo kuch bhi ho aurat ko hi sacrifice karna padta he aurat ka bhi selfrespect hoti hein
I don't like the character of Andaleep
Yeh Andleeb starting se lekar last yak badtameez rah gyi
Debu bekar charector khud apne paw me khare hona chate hai or khud zara ko nuimaire se sadhi karne bola bekar charector
Zara ki maine film dekhi sanam teri kasam kya mast film h 😅last ka seen ufffff 😢

We want happy ending
I hate deebo character
Kuch zyada ho rha h iss ladki ka jab khud ka bf hote hue. Bhi shaadi krli tb theek ....ab bechare ne DNA test krwa liya itna drama kr rhi h bss bhai

Mard kia kia ovid kar jata he kitna bardasht kar jata he numair ne kia kia bardasht kia andaleb ka lekin andaleb se 1 galti maaf nai ke ja rahi is se yehi sabit hua mard ziada ala zarf hota he

Overacting
Numair ne b esy maf kia tha jo koe b mard maf ni karta
Bhut hi fazool attitude dikhaya parents ne puri bat kiun nhi batai andaleeb ko
Y etna hilta kyo h kya teren m peda hua tha
I want a happy ending ❤😊
Victim card khel ri hy bilawajah
Andleeb phly bi bewakoof Thi or ab tuc bewakoof he hai 😂jithy thi kothi uthy he aan khaloti 🤣
Deebu over acting😂😂😂😂😂mental girl
Heroine is acting so immature from the beginning. She only run from difficulties. She doesn't face anything like immatue teenage
Being old school lady I dont agree with andaleebs attitude,she is being stubborn
Mjy herat hy koi b andlib ko ye ku nhi btanrha k numair ny dna ku krwaya masla kya tha
Ifee😢
Ghaatiya fr

How can they skip the part when numair get to know that Andaleeb is alive?? Why it is so normal for all of themm
❤❤❤❤ 😮😮😮😮 i Love you ❤❤
I hate now how this drama is giving our minds the mad Sense of never compromising  He is apologizing to her and also have reasons but she is not even listening thats the worst thing  I hate debo character now
Numair ignored lots from Depo past she should understand that.
6:41 Akbar shah yha kaise😂😂😂
New entry was good and deebu kaese maa hh😅😅😅 bache k pass tk nhi gyii  Jbki aayi bache k liy h

Please don't give Islamic comments on drama ❤❤❤❤❤
Boring episode
Hum hai
Andaleeb ko do thappad prny chahye itni bari to ghalti nae thi k aisa extreme step Lia jata.
Sehar khan Masallah my favourite ❤️💞💞💞💞
Debu is rigid......
😊😊😊
Sab se bakwas tho andalib ki ma bap he , beti ki galti bhool  gaye , ak thappad lagao yrr
andleeb is so wrong .
Serial ko itna ghatiya banadiya ki dekhne ko mann nahin karta..no emotions,no expression 🙄kya se kya banadiya
Debu is a lose and senseless character.
Maa to olad k ly jan b dy deti r isko beti ki taky ki fikr b ni
Anadi is looking so cute
Bakeas episode
RIP Rabia Iram production
Debo ko numaira k pas wapes jana chhye
They've ruined the whole beautiful drama. Jafaa is now the biggest downfall.
Ye drama kisne banya yr kitna bor hai chiii kuch bhi log bataya hai
Rarbia Iram
My favorite drama❤
Andaleeb is so immature... Numair ne use kitna moka diya tha aur andaleeb ne numair ki bat vi nahi suni...😢
Finish this drama with happy ending as as soon as possible .. Too much toxicity!!
Iski izat or waqar tb kha gya tha jb kisi or lrky k ly golya khai thi ya ghr sy bhag re thi
I love this drama 😊
31 episode
Maybe some people find me wrong but i feel like deebu is exaggerating now
31 bhi thoda jaldi kar dena
Bangladesh ❤🎉
Mjy andleeb zehaar ku lag rhi hai😂😂😂😂
Andaleeb parents are a worse example of parenting  Always selfish decisions suddenly they remember thier grandchild
How can everyone blame andeleeb for her behaviour bruhh jis larki p guzarti hai usssi ko pata hota hai even numair bhi theek hai apni jagah lkn andeleeb bhi ghlt nhi hai accept that.!!
I hate deebu's attitude 😤
The depu character seems to be so irritating.. Without knowing the reason why numair did like that, she shouldn’t do like that… I wish numair divorce her if she want without begging her because one or the other day she will know the reason and regret her action..
Any Indian here 😂😅❤
Bhai CHOTI SI bachi ko Akela chora hay ma ko koi hosh nhi
Boring kar diye h drama🥺

How immaturely andleeb is behaving, when nunair accepted her even after having an affair with moiz why can't she compromise and try to  understand numair, she has been behaving like an imature child since the  beginning.
Andleeb 900 chohe khake billi hajj ko chalee
Andaleeb is getting disgusting.
If he is infertile how he became a father
How come no one is calling out Numair for not telling that he could not have children, and potentially spoiling the life of another girl.
Hi
Fazool larki
Yes ind
Jab debu ki galati thi tb numair ne compromise kiya lekin ab debu ko hrr chez perfect chahiye 15:20
Deebu should forgive numair😤
Deebu has a pattern on self destruction - and leaves disaster in her wake. She goes to extremes - and catastrophizes - she doesnt care about consequences and how her actions affect others.
Itna samjha rahe maa baap par sach nahi bata rahe andalep ko numair ne jo bataya sach 🤔
plzz 1 week= 2 episode atleast 😢😢
❤
Boring 😴 ho gaye
Me
She couldnt forgive one mistake of dr numair
andaleeb is a stupid character throughout
❤
Y pakistan channel wale kb se bewakoof bna rhe hr kisi drama ka teaser me 2 baar se 2nd last episode..
Her dafa second last episode likh daty hn pher last episode kbi b ni Hoti 😂😂😂😂😂
kiyaaa bewakufana story h iss time andaleeb ki yrr had h bewakufi ki
Mujhe lagtha hai ka yeah dramaa dekhna  ab stop kar chaheye bilkul bakwas script chl raha hai😅
Wrong life is smjhotas.aaj issi liyah divorce rate itna high ho giya hai no one wants to compromise.mother is so right,deebus action was very wrong
This drama is very good 👍👍
Debuu is getting irritating
Ab ye drama bor karne laga hai
السلام علیکم جو لڑکیاں ہماری کمپنی میں ان لائن ورکنگ کرنا چاہتی ہیں ہماری کمپنی کی طرف سے ٹریننگز  ہونے جا رہی ہیں تو ائیں ہماری کمپنی کی طرف سے ٹریننگ اٹینڈ کریں
I miss you too Zara, an amazing character and relatable...
Nice drama❤😂🎉 who like 😊
Can you guys see a trouble maker character in this drama. Who hurts parents,  partner, sister, friends  and even her own child. I mean all the peoples around her gets more or less headache because of her selfishness , no one is left,  not a single person.  They shouldn’t reunite. At least numair and his girl won’t have to face unnecessary trouble in future. Is that case it will be happy ending.  Let the parents nurture their immature kiddo.
totally bakwass drama
Ese ma baba se dushman accah hai
"इस्लाम दुनिया का सबसे शांतिपूर्ण धर्म है, और अज़ान दुनिया की सबसे खूबसूरत आवाज़ है  अल्हम्दुलिल्लाह..🥰❤️

Katne cute hai baby 🐥🍼🥰🥰🥰
Vote for Dr. Zara and Dr. Sameer couple ❤
How can mother andaleeb leave her daughter😢 alone ??
Dr zara akli hi airport chali gai.maa bap nhi gy strange 😅
Andaleeb always takes hasty decisions.plz dont teach girlz that they should be strong to leave husband and live alone,its not right
Sahi kehte h log 99 achai karo 1 galti karne pr log kehte h 100 Galt kaam kiye h isne
Atleast zara deserve better ending
Sehar khan my best actor
Andleeb  jis dard aziyat se guzri hai yad h use but Nomair k sath jo mohabat bhara rishta banaya wo yad ni h Andleeb  ek galat fahmi ki wajah se apna rishta todne ki zid very bad Andleeb 😙💔
Maja nhi aya yaar
Please andleep forget the numair 😢😢😢
Esa mard ke sat rehne se marjana accah hai
Non sense Deebu
Ye last episode hai kya
I feel like season 2 will come soon
Ek minute. Numair ne hospital se resign nahi kardiya tha? Tou ab hospital mein kya karraha hai?😭😭😭 This drama makes no sense
I just don't like andleeb character and her thinking such girls destroy their homes without reason when they find such a nice person .mistakes are part of life but one sided thinking always leads to destruction.
Ua Raba na
Now Andaleeb is overreacting
anadeel kitni pyari hain🥺❤️
Areyyyyy bhaii kiss zamane me ye andleeb reason sunegii dimaag khrab krdiyaa yrr hafte me ek baar ata h hdd hai bore krdiyaa ekdm
Aj uski galt fahmi ko ye aoni ego bna bethi h
skip skip skip
Andleeb ko wo waqt bhool gya jb numair ny eski etni bri galti maaf ki thi
Any India here 🥀
I am really irritated by andaleeb and numair’s character now  Numair can tell every one about his reason but not andaleeb  even tho he is trying he could have just said in a minute
❤❤
Andaleeb is overreacting
2 din parlour me mirror saaf krke, teesre din partnership pe parlour khol liya, or ab madam deebu bht kuch dekh chuki hain life me, mazboot aurat hain, or nayi andaleeb hain bhai sahaab. speed of light ko v maat de di inhone. bhaang khake likha tha kya script. mawra gayi ab hum v jaa rhe or mjhse ye notanki or in actors ka faltu acting ni sakaa rha.
Jafa is the best example of  how a well scripted drama  successfully Dragged( with silly logics) so long just for trp. Plz end this drama as soos as possible
Ajeeb drama ha Jab zara na numair ko sab bata dya tha toh ussay debu ko bata daina chahye tha sab sach ka numair baap nahi ban shkta. Aur jab maa baap ko pata laga unho na be kuch ja kar debu ko nahi bataya. What a failed indian story
Any indian here???😂😂
2 paise na kma liya ...mazboot smjhne  lgi khud ko ...😂😂 faltu....
Aaj kisi ne yehh comment nhi kiya any Indians😂
Sehar khan bht he buri lagrahi h 😅😅
I think  now she is not doing good her husband loves her alot he always support him in every situation she should also compromise now these types of behaviour ruined life .
Bakwas ho gya h
She's gynaecologist already specialized ab konsi specialization krne ja rhi h? 😮
I love the way everyone is still blaming numair and not getting mad at andaleeb for being toxic and this bad ugh. She knows very well how to play victim. Girl thinks she will take care of her daughter bruh be fr even when your mom said for anadil's sake, you still chose divorce making hard for the kid just for ur Satisfiction selfish girl!! Lol.
Deebu character is one of the most senseless character but after sadaf first she was mad after moiz then suddenly she moved on and loved dr numair then she left her child and then she came back this is literally a big thing and but she should listen dr numair and now she had her newborn child so she should think before leaving them. This is a mistake she can forgive atleast🥲 seriously na to moizz ki ese kch glti thi ki usse mohabbat khtm hojaye aur na ab ese numair ki h
Bakwas
Andleeb come on itni bhi bri bat nhi DNA fzool drag kr rhy hài drama k heroine sy hi dil utr rha hai fans ka 🤧
Our andleeb ko itna drma krne ki Kya zarrort ha Bhai Tum waja b puch lo apne shohor se asa Kiya q
Vote for ending for numair and andaleeb ❤ Especially for Zara ❤😊
Itna andalib uchal rhi pehle jawab de k bacha kiska hai😅😅  Jb wo baap ni bn skta to ye kaha se lae h,uski wjh to sune ye pgl ldki
It feels like it ends with us 😂 unnecessary drama 🥱
My
Bhot he bekar kar dia ha Drame ko bore kr dia ha
Amazing drama yr
why zara is n=being self centered not saying the truth to andaleeb and not telling numair about her as well why just talking just about her self some serious issues are going andaleeb is a big news and doesnt even bothered to tell
Finally doctor zara ko doctor partner mil gaya new entry doctor ki 😂😂😂😂itne sare likes first time mai to famous ho gai thank you so much everyone 😃😃😃 itni Khushi itni khushi 😭😭😭
Dramo me kitni jaldi ladki move on kr jati h dukho se pichli zindagi se kyu k unko koi na koi mil jata h,reall zindagi wahi gamo me guzrti h purani yaade or ghr walo k badle hue nazariye
Debu's charcter has no sense 😢❤ Finally her  Mother is absolutely right she should forgive Dr Numair ❤😊

Makker should listen to audiences
Feeling so sad for ending of jaafa Will miss debu
To kis ne kaha tha andleeb baji itna kuch saho agar trust kar leti numair par . Numair ne hamesha andlerb ka sath diya or us ke affair ko bhi qabool kiya or andleeb ne numair Jo safai ka moqa tak nai diya 😢
Aap Nahi ho
Please support me
Disgusting Disgusting drama and andaleeb 's character is so so Disgusting 🥴🥴
Dr zara finally got someone she deserves he's so handsome i cantttt😭🫶🏻
Nowadays divorce has become a game. No matter how much the world has become modernized, marriages and divorces should still be taken seriously. Numair and andleeb would move on after divorce but their child would have to suffer her whole life. They should compromise for their child. If not then such parents have no right to expect anything good from their children too because they also had sacrificed nothing for their children
Only Child Suffers and parents always grow their ego and destroy da relationship......The Drama shows the character of Andaleeb so immature taking decisions by herself 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Deebu is behaving like totally no sense girl😅😂drama Ka name jafa h or actors totally opposite harkatain kr rhy😅😂Kisi ki acting sy b jafa word Ka nae pta chal rha😅
Mjy koi bta dy plz k jab wo bap ni ban skta tha tu ab kesy ban gya??
Dr Zaras family didn't go to see her off at the airport?
Numair ki galti hai but uska v situation samjhna chahiye deepu ko and usk pass Chale jana chahiye.  Self respect is very important but he is sorry for everything aur usne report v nhi dekha
Drama and hone wala hai kya please yes or no
Any Pakistan are here ??🇵🇰
👍
We want happy ending!!!!  Please it is getting worse!!!🥹 Andaleeb became rude feeling sad for Numeir!!! Can't see the pain in Numeir's face!!!!!!
Me who feel bad for anadil at the end of the day the child always suffers💔💔
Bilkul
Vote for happy ending❤😊
Such a stupid drama
Islami zindabad ❤
Areee yar last episode kab aye ga 😢
Both the husband and wife are moving ahead in life. It's the child who is suffering😢
free PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸
I think the character of andaleeb is immature, like in immaturity she attempted suicide, then in misunderstanding without proper communication she left and prtend to be dead. If she is angry on her husband then what's her parents and child fault. She is the only daughter of her parents and without thinking about them she took that step which is not right and somewhere her parents is also responsible for her actions because if they clear communicate with her and make her strong independent then she must not taken such steps
