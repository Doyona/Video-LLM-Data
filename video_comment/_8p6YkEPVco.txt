Alice in borderland 3 full movie in hindi
Season 1 and season 2 the best
IF ARISU SACRIFICED FOR A BABY ILL LOOSE IT I SWEAR BRO
even Squid game does not touch 20% of  AIB  😮‍💨💥
why not just make everyone zombies?
Netflix you cancel so many good shows justfor your money. I'mgonnabe sad if they add AIB inthe list. WHAT A WASTE
usually I expect TV shows to not beat their S1/2 But this was GOOOD! Season 3sent me through a loop but not the one I expected! Read job!t
I just finished I need season 4. If Netflix don't wanna renew give it to Hulu or HBO
It reminds me of Anime Sword Art Online! !
Now season 3 is on netflix ans Arisu found out Usagi 1  month pregnant  episodes  4😊
I love it
I need Movie pls tell THIS movie app
Guys i need this movie
Just finished the third season a few minutes ago. It's been six episodes of fun and intense moments. I can say that the first and second seasons were better than the third one. Job well done to the cast and the crew behind that season of the series. If the third season was not the last one, see you someday. _Sayonara,_ Japan? Hello, US?
I just looked up the release date for season 3. I heard that Netflix gauges views within the first twenty-eight days. I didn’t look up the release date until now. If I had known, I would’ve finished the series sooner so it could have a better chance at another season.
I did not expect that the end would be that bad 💔. I thought more than this , why not why Netflix.😢
The best part was the ending scene when Gi Hun appeared at Borderland and said: "oh no, more games.......WTF"
Boring 😡
Love season 3 👏
Very bad, poor season 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
No chishiya ,no interest
Will watch this after 30th Nov
Is it true that season 3 of AiB isn't that good compared to season 1 and 2?
The ending was goated
Where is chishiya ? 😢
Worst season so far
NETFLIX i have one last wish. Please make Arisu and Usagi actor/actress to become David Martinez and Lucy Kushinada in Cyberpunk: Edgerunner Live Action !!!!
EPIC SERIES! I fell in love with USAGI AND ARISU! They are really meant for each other! Lovely name of the baby! ALICE! Let’s go!
Game mein Intens nahi hai, Writing macy pacy Maza wala factor missing tha, overall S3 is ok okay Timepass 🤷Just joker point of  u story nothing to Extraordinary 1 ⭐ Star Out 5 Abo-Avrage
disappointed.... stupid ending, barely any games, the old cast appears for 1 sec.... =/  aya and nijiro... i get that nijiro maybe couldnt because of him...buy aya... really?! 1 sec in the entire series? again.. no wonder theres no season 4
Come on guys 2 seasons of this crap was already enough to make me feel bored & it wasn't even that good
I've Just Finished it. I Love it. Like always. ❤ Lots of Love to Everyone. & Happy Diwali
アリスとバンダの繋がりってあったっけ？アリスによって永住権を手にしたとはいえバンダがアリスにこだわる理由が分からない。
Honestly, I expected more. The Joker should have been someone trickier, not just some old player. Most of the decisions made by the new player were stupid, and the final was just... meh
Same cliffhanger ending as Squid Game, something tells me that Netflix was behind this shit
This is thounsand time better than squid game 🎉🎉 its should have better recognition even
im gonna miss this amazing series so much.. ❤❤❤
Better than squid game
Am I the only one in the recent comments who liked S3?? 😂 I hated S2 so much that I wanted to give up but gave S3 a chance and I liked it. S1 & S3 are great. Not S2.
This season was trash. Literal trash. If this was a college project every kid would have failed. I thought the Japanese writers were smarter than this. Stop copying American shit writers and using chat gtp.
Alice in Borderland, S1 & S2 - Best 👍🏻 but S3 - most irritating and time wasting series ever seen.waste of time S3 👎🏻
This will forever be one of my favorites 🫶
I hope the writing has gotten better
1:16 Arisu survived!
Season 2 is the best
Ss3 boring
Holy crap what a let down! Games were WAY too complicated. When the characters explain it, then the show explains it and they re-explain it throughout the game, ITS TOO HARD! The new characters were ridiculous. The lead girl went from bad ass I'll take care of myself to arisu! Arisu! Where are you arisu!  And arisu just got....lame? The second season ending was just fine..or they should have gone with the whole simulation arc...either way, I was so looking forward to it and it SUCKED.
Awful, awful season finale 😠  They turned the last episode into a f*cking soap opera with boring and stupid scenes. And when you thought it cannot be worse, they hinted at an American spinoff, which I hope never will be done.
I think Alice in borderland might be the worst season of a series I've ever seen. An absolute abomination. Worse than squid game's last season - which was utter shite.
Jgn pernah gantung kan series ini... 👌🙏👍
Should have end in season 2 idk why they are stretching, seems like another season is coming.
YOO I JUST REALIZED ALICE IN BORDERLAND IS  KIND OF LIKE THE MATRIX 4
Alice in borderland way way way way better than stupid squid games
Last 2 episodes of S3 is 0/10
Spoiler >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Kazuya death was the most sad thing in this season
i miss unemployed arisu
I felt like at least some of the games in the season were made intentionally because they are culturally sensitive in Japan, like the subway gas, the pandemic, or the millions of arrows, that looked like a volcano.
Im done watching 1-2 season in just 1 day 🥹🥹🥹 And season 3 is out now! 😭
Why did Arisu magically become majestic
Is this is a final season
WAR IS OVER ARISU ALIVE!!
I finished this season, there are some similarities between Squid Game.  It's an okay season but definitely not necessary because I believe season 2 is a great ending.
This was horrible
Arisu: How long have I been gone ? Ann: 2 minutes  Whole series is imagination in 2 minutes and finished 🤔😅
The best movie ever!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
How baby didn't count in 2nd to exit room it clearly said 5 baby make 6 exit room 7 then banycpunts last ass writings
Okso in next toast roomitvwasto move on baby makes 6. It counted b4 but at end didn't lame plot hole
Where is chishiya ⁉️
One of the WORST Seasons of this series, how did that crippled guy survive all the games? Not only that , the games are so poorly made , no suspense at all
Just finished S3.. this series is unforgettable 😭❤️
OH MY –
Bro watch the trailer when you finish the season it crazy!
it ends like squid game I mean they went to the US 🤣🤣
self note: flew above my head /have a better understanding:  J♥- solitary confinement  ❓ 🃏zombie hunt  K♦- beauty contest (balance scale) > 🃏old maid   miscellaneous games  7♠- boiling water J♣- tower takedown Q♣- balance beam tower J♦- logic grid bomb K♥- maze of self
Broooo where is chishiya 😭???
Some people here think that Usagi's decision to go back was random or out of character. But I don't think Usagi's decision to go to the Borderlands again was random.   When I rewatched the series again, there were scenes of Usagi grieving her father's death and that still stayed with her throughout the series. She also had a flashback when her father told her to live her life even if he's gonna d*e, that just doesn't sit right for her and to even us, the audience.   Also, keep in mind that she forgot about her time in the Borderlands already. Then she was manipulated by Ryuji, thinking she's gonna meet her father in Borderlands since he's always in her mind like haunting her (meaning he hasn't passed on to heaven yet or reincarnated whatever you believe). She didn't know Ryuji's full background, or that if she agreed, he would pull her back to the Borderlands.   So, Usagi's decision was not random at all. She has unresolved issues, she doesn't want to open it up to Arisu since she is living a happy life like what her father wants her to have. But still want to have closure for her father's d*ath.
better wrap it up soon, season 3 is getting stupid. don't repeat squid game mistake.
Netflix stop ruining the original projects with ur stupid writing the original work will always win any garbage you try to produce always endsbad..i can't see the point why u carrying this moron in the wheel chair into more episodes...i could careless about him. Wish u idiots would stay true to the manga. Hope this gets animated and stay true to the bitter end than this crap you are pushing out.
Best part of entire season 1,2, was  episode 7 season 2
The show ended after season 2
3/10   Feels forced/rushed, bit confusing and not really logical to make any sense.
I was legit excited for s3 after s1 n 2 but seems like kinda disappointed coz it's mix of squid game s3 where the baby was also added as a player and escape room 2. Especially the train scene that's a copied scene from escape room 2 , the marathon.
I just hope to get answers on fireworks and who knocked on the bathroom door
😂😂i waste my time  Flop season 3
Can we all admit Season 1 and Season 2 were much better? Season 3 was 👎
Can someone recommend a site or an app to watch for free I don't have Netflix
Please make a season 4 of Alice in Borderland it's my favorite series but not american but japanese
@1:01 ; YO THATS DIGITAL SPLATTER ! USE MULTIPLY BLEND MODE NEXT TIME EDITOR , WHAT THE HELL , YOU WORK FOR BIG SERIES AND YOU USE STOCK FOOTAGE ALSO ???
Just Finished season 3. I can say just one word: Incredible. Ignore the comments go watch and enjot
SPOILER AHEAD:    Usagi wasn’t tricked — she willingly took a drug that would stop her heart just to see her father one more time.  As a filmmaker, I’ve got huge respect for the masterful suspense, the production quality, and the design of the games this season. Technically, it’s outstanding — easily one of Netflix’s best-made shows.  But thematically, it felt forced and frustrating. A married woman, who vowed to stand by her husband “in sickness and in health,” choosing to take a potentially lethal drug to process her trauma — without thinking of him — just felt repellent and far-fetched to me.  Brilliant execution, but that moral choice really pulled me out of it.
so... Cate Blanchett as Alice?
Why are u copy pasting squid game script like totally. They now make episodes on usa and you guys doing it too 😮‍💨😮‍💨
1:56six legged penthatlon 😅😅😅
This show sucks
Such a waste of time! First two seasons were great but this one was so bad.
Don't worry be strong I MEET YOU AT PEAK
What Happened? Season 3 Completely Lost the Plot Honestly, the first two seasons of Alice in Borderland were incredible. They were so smart, so intense-easily an 8/10. The games were genius, and I was completely invested in the characters. It was a benchmark for the whole survival thriller genre.  But Season 3? It's baffling. It feels like whoever took over the writing just didn't know where to go with the story. The plot feels forcefully pushed and completely directionless, as if they desperately needed a reason to drag the characters back into the Borderland.  It's a chaotic mess that's unsatisfying from start to finish. I'm shocked by the massive drop in quality; it's a complete disaster compared to the brilliance that came before it. This season barely deserves a 2/10. It's a real shame to see a great show end up like this.
これはすごい
Definately waiting for next season
So basically the wheelchair guy want to bang Arisu wife and to justify this they had to make a whole series out of it 😂 Jesus WTF
waited for many years to be disappointed.  so badly written 😢😢😢😢
If you make a stupid American version of it at all we will have a problem! Just throw it away right now that it's over with season 3 and call it a day. DON'T YOU DARE BRINGING IT BACK NETFLIX!
Just finished season 1 - 3… 😭 This Show Is Good…  Now I gotta watch Squid game 😮
0:09 Shocking, I didnt expected season 3 to be good usually after season 1, 2 and 3 are the worst made. But i liked season 3 the most games are sensible interesting, reasonably understandable to see how manipulation worked. Cinematography, direction and casting were good. Most importantly i liked the sets. Good job to the team and netflix. Keep up the good work.
Usagi pissed me off so much in this season, especially the finale. She constantly put everyones live in danger because she kept having memories of her father and just sitting there - i actually yelled "move you bitch!" At the screen because she just lay there on the floor so arisu had to run in and put his own life in danger (again) for her. I get that her dad dying was sad and she has flashbacks, but c'mon, theyre in a life or death situation!
whatever it is, for me Notbad At All
Sesone 4 Comming soon ?
it was worth the wait!
We got Arisu with a job before GTA6
SEASON 3 WAS SO GOOD OMFGGGGGGG
Just finished watching season 3 and god i really really loved this season
The baby won again😂😂
We wanted old and original characters, but what we got😢, its disappointed us, please let them come in season 4, chishiya, ann and other characters is emotions❤😢
I just Started this season...wish me luck and Drop a line review 😊❤
Bro this isn't good at all just shit
in squid game gi hun : i have played this game before in alice in bordarline arisu : i have plyed this game before
People done know how to understand the games and they blame the season ..  If you have patience and can understand it .  Season 03 is by far more intense and thrilling ❤ loved it
This season sucks. What’s wrong with producers? Why can’t they ever use the same recipe. It’s almost like they have to change things to justify their existence. Thanks for ruining a great series!
Just realized why the main character named Arisu, Japanese pronounce Alice as "Arisu", and the story is about Arisu in Borderland, japanese manga name are always unique. 😂😂
The Worst And a trashy Season btw
I Can't Believe Arisu Actually Said The Line!!!🤣
They milking ts?
It was good until the last game, just like Season 2.
Worst season ever
⚠️⚠️⚠️WARNING!!!! DON'T WATCH IT!!! NEVER! ONLY 1 AND 2 SEASON!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️
what the hell, Sunato Banda?
Season 3 is a bit of a let down compared to season 1 and 2. Unfortunate.
Wher3 is chishya???
Except for the games, this season is not worth watching. There is no story progression. No new reveals, nothing. Instead the reason they gave for Usagi going back into the game is completely stupid and irritating.
Czemu nam dali takiego chujowego lektora do tego, ciężko się ogląda :/ najlepszy lektor jest ten ze Squid Game
I'm waiting for the season 4😎😎
The Real Alice is finally out, welcome season 4 🎉
ARISU'S TRANSFORMATION THOOOO
This one was just terrible,reason she went back there and her and that wheelchair guy's strange relationship ,epic and sad music when a ''mobster'' who killed others on purpose in the games is about to die,like you are supposed to feel bad for him....missing all the characters from other seasons who survived.Could of do much better,it was bad and rushed and at the end they switched it to the US same as Squid games
Squid game s03🤡 Alice in borderland s03☠️  Thank god a baby didn't win again!!
This was a dumb season
please netflix remake GANTZ be like this series
season 4 when?
why people hate usagi
Believe it or not, never marry a Mental women.. epi 6- usagi ! Iykyk She was mental from the beginning of season 01.. and arisu just married a mental bitch
This ideal same Anime Sword art online
I am so happy to see season 3, I absolutely loved it, all the characters, their backstories, visuals, storyline, message,  portrayal, everything was so amazing ❤❤❤ The ending was so beautiful also 🔥🔥🔥 Absolutely loved this season ♥️♥️
Believe it or not, usagi is the annoying character since season 01
I hate what u did for Usagi!
Mischaracterization of Usagi  I know Usagi gets a lot of hate this season (and I understand where the hate is coming from) but this season is written purely out of netflix’s ass, and butchered Usagi’s character so bad.  Wether you read the manga or watched the show (especially S1) you ought to remember Usagi is NOT an emotional person whatsoever. She’s a climber making her very practical.  In the manga, Usagi was bullied. And watched her father hang himself right in front of her eyes. So she’s not someone easily broken if you may say.    Also, in the show and manga, Usagi’s dad died at least a year before the current events take place. Adding the five years she spent with Arisu, that makes him dead for 6 years. Why would she all of a sudden get super emotional about him? Her decision to endanger herself, trust her life with a stranger, and pull Arisu in with her (because did she think he will leave her?) is extremely selfish and out of character.   Usagi doesn’t act based on her emotions, rather just pure logic. She was the one keeping Arisu in check multiple times over his breakdowns. They literally became close because she saved him from dying, telling him that just because his friends died doesn’t mean he has to. In what world would someone like that (who spoke such words to Arisu like a day after his friends died) risk her life for the same reason?   I don’t get why they couldn’t just adapt the damn manga or at the very least let Aso write the season himself. Anyhow, read the manga and be prepared for a new Usagi.
Season 3 not good as 1&2
Watched season 3 of Alice in Borderland  It was a great ending with great games 🩷💕✨
But hindi mai kab ayega
Seeing the OG crew so happy and healthy at the end was everything to me
The way Rei carried this season has to be studied. Our iconic diva
The way this season so effortlessly cleared squid game
Arisu in S1🗿📈 s2😎⚖️ s3🤡📉
i’m so glad i didn’t watch the trailer. i didn’t even know Season 3 came out until i saw its sponsored widget under ‘Media’ on my PS5 LOL. My face lit up so quick, i stopped everything i was doing and said ‘i’m gonna rewatch Season 1 & 2 first’ because it’s been 2 ½ years, and that’s exactly what i did. The Trailer spoiled some really awesome scenes too. Season 3 was FULL of surprises, and this season would have never went so  hard for me if i had watched the trailer. (P.S. - WHEN YOU SEE AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TRAILER FOR A NEW SEASON OF ANY BELOVED SERIES OF YOURS, DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. GO WATCH THE SEASON, DON’T SPOIL YOURSELF; TREAT YOURSELF—THE EXPERIENCE IS ALWAYS BETTER THAT WAY. REWATCH THE PREVIOUS SEASONS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER TO GET THE FULL EFFECT FROM THAT NEW SEASON. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT.)
After I watch season 3. I realized they put everything in this trailer.
Japanese should make more sci fi shows their awesome
I DIDNT KNOW IT CAME out until five days later? Criminal.
I've finished the series. The scale is the same, but some parts were out of the place and dragged out. The finale was disappointing, lacking real answers or main closure. What about Ann? How did she recall all the events? I loved seeing Arisu and Usagi's story, but six episodes is too short. I want more of their sweet love story.
Mannnn where the hell is my chisiyaaa
Finished all episodes today.. One word "Disappointing" Its not even a 5% if we compare with season 1 and 2  But i hope we will get season 4 in future... 30 Sep 2025
This is EXTREME stupid ending... 3 seasons for nothing ,a futuristic after(middle) death  without purpose.!!!
Interesting, but altogether weird concept of purgatory as death games. Why NF gives this a third season yet cancels a gem like Cowboy Beabop and others is a shame. 😢
Netflix season 4 come fast plz with old characters😢
IVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE
Just finished it, it's good but i don't know what the point of this season , so can anyone tell me??
I honestly think they should’ve finished this series on second season. It finished really good. Season 3 was crap and it seems season four will be the same or worst
Arisu changed? 😅
Season 1 and 2 is best as compared to season 3
OH NOT THE BABY AGAIN
3 u sezon daha farkli beklerdim yinede guzeldi.
Just finished watching Season 3 about half an hour ago, and I wanted to share some thoughts with the community. First of all, I think S3 was a banger. I know people are comparing it to S1 and S2, but honestly, it doesn’t need to be compared—each season has its own strengths. The storyline this time felt refreshing, the new characters added a lot, and Arisu + Usagi are still the emotional core of the show. The games were super creative, the cinematography was beautiful, and the pacing kept me hooked. And let’s be real: after they teased the Joker card at the end of S2, they had to make S3. It really tied things together well. That said, there were definitely some loopholes that bugged me. Biggest one: why did Usagi agree to return to the Borderlands with Ryuijin just to meet her dead father? Like… girl, you had a peaceful life with Arisu 😭🙏 That decision felt so random and out of character. Still, overall, I really enjoyed this season. IMO it’s actually better than Squid Game. I’d give it a 5/5 and will probably rewatch it soon.
Chishiya missing 😭😭😭
I won't season 4 with old character 😢
Diamond = material things  Flower = emotions Heart = human body Ace=  character  Life is a JOKER  we are simulation , experiment, test,  challenge.  Humans choose daily life . What to eat. To work. To love . To buy. To live . Etc.
So, nobody is gonna talk about the end, was that arisu that died????
So they actually show some games from the manga that weren't featured in the first season
I think the zombie card is gonna be a game where chota and karube returns as zombies. One bite. A person turns into a zombie. Since basically they got hit by a car.
So basically like an inception concept where they go in deep sleep and then save each other ?
The only brains in S3 are Arisu, Usagi and Ryugi 😅 some are benchmobs 😂 okay i will mention Rei too 😅
Alyssa Dezek wonderland😂😂😮❤
Ok now  I need season 4 please 🥹
Spoiler alert :Alice main character entry ❤️😄 last scene
I'm currently on the last episode and I have to say, this season is pure trash. Absolutely garbage. The first 2 seasons were so good and they literally just had no story to tell this time around and it's so bad. I'm so disappointed because I waited so long for this. If it ends bad also, it's gonna be one of the worst shows I have seen in awhile!
Alice in Borderland was one of my favorite shows, and I still think the first two seasons are excellent. Netflix always ruins every series with their sequels; such greed for money destroys everything good they originally created. The third season is terrible, like a child wrote the script. Ninety percent of the time it's just games, which are overly complicated and barely understandable. The final episode is a mild disaster—you just wait for it to end and never want to watch the third season again.
Netflix is milking these shows. Squid Games is going to America, there are hints of AIB going there too. these Netflix shows... very popular that's why the production are reactive to the reception of the viewers, unlike Dark, which was slated for 3 seasons at the start, and look how good it turned out.  btw, spoiler:  these babies, Hellbound was first, then there's SG, now AIB - at least here it's not a baby yet.
If I had a penny for every time the third season of an Asian show about deadly games ended hinting at an American spinoff, I would have two pennies which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice.
It should have ended the same way as in the manga💔
Ann didn't die?
But so far I have seen the first 3 episodes of this season and I have to say I am utterly disappointed... Nothing makes any sense... They took the games and made them a world where you get where you have a near death experience?  But offer no explanation as to how this can happen? Also the new characters are not interesting at all. The pace of it so far is abysmal too. Huge moments of really bad executed exposition... And generally I don't understand... Why are all these people there? Why did they went back in other than Arisu and his girlfriend which the movies actually explain?  I don't understand, this is such a terrible let down...
❤
I LOVED itt!
See that guy in the wheelchair? He could play Colonel Sanders.
Very boring season 3
Actually im disappointed, i wasnt waiting for such season, it was trash, the dialogue looks like a kid has written it, im sorry i was expecting something cooler than squid game but in the end, the final season of squid game wins!
柚西變左西柚
Does anyone have any theory on the next season! i believe that westerners are gonna be in alice in borderland aswell along with Chusiya and the rest of the og squad. and the whole world is now apart of the game.
Legend - aib 💪 Kids - squid game 🤣
Imagine Chishiya Rei Kuina Ann Arisu Usagi all in 1 game!
Guys just watch season 2 to relive Chisiya & Kuina moments. Epic charcters!  Maybe they'll be back for season 4
So squid games turns into US movie soon, even now Alice in borderland as well .....
The baby part already exists in the Manga which came out years before squish games. Also AIB came out earlier than SG. Plus Kuina was already there in Alice in borderland as a trans, so squid games adding it later feels like a cheap ripoff and just to add drama
I can't believe i am saying this but Season 3 was very lackluster, and i don't usually drop comment on Youtube. Sure the games are cool but there are some plot holes that bother me until the very end, like why this guy can travel between worlds and hunt the survivors, it's not explained well until the end. And the overall pacing feels very rushed since it's only 6 episodes. The new side characters aren't well developed unlike the first two seasons. Again, pacing problem. Also, it couldn't have been more obvious that this season is very Squid Game Season 3-ified, and no it's not only because of the game concept thing, watch what happens in the last game and also the last scene. It's way too similar. And i truly don't understand what's psychological about the last game... You just need to find the room, why are some random imaginary scenes on a projector affecting you that much. The whole season feels too underwhelming. It started nice but fell flat, could have been better.
HONEST REVIEW>>>SPOILER FREE>>>  *The games actually end in season 2. This is basically a kind of sequel...only Usagi and Arisu are same, Rest all are changed. * I found games same level interesting as season 1 and 2.  * Opinion- I liked it...finshed in one go and  was quite captivating. However, if season 3 was a continuation with chishiya and all. I feel it would be even better. But it makes sense... as JOKER is never a complulsory card,,,its add on...similarly this season was an ADD ON... could have been avoided.
Soooooo whereee is Chishiya mffffffssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rei
Shouldve ended with season 2. What a terrible season.
Hello world. This is Morocco — not the glossy postcards you see, but the hidden truth. Families who lost everything in the 2023 earthquake are still living in tents, waiting for homes that never come. Hospitals are overcrowded and without medicine, mothers wait for hours only to be told there is nothing for their children. Schools are packed with too many students and too few teachers, leaving children with diplomas that mean nothing because there are no jobs. Entire neighborhoods are destroyed to build stadiums and luxury projects, while the poor are pushed out of their houses with nowhere to go. Young people who raise their voices are silenced, beaten, or jailed, their dreams crushed before they are born. Children are forced to work in the streets instead of learning in classrooms, some disappearing into places where no one asks questions. Poverty is everywhere — fathers with empty hands, mothers crying because they cannot feed their families, youth staring at a future that does not exist. This is the Morocco that lives in silence, the Morocco the world does not see, the Morocco that deserves justice, dignity, and hope. No justice= no tourism
Spoiler alert!! But good news Arisu didn’t pull a Gi-hun WE’RE SAVED!!!!!!!!
This season is so bad . The joker is a joke , the games are mid compare to the first two seasons, and they going with the same way they did with squid game like American borderland bruh everything about this suck
ALICE IN BORDERLAND, the best Film i have ever watched ❤
THIS WAS STRAIGHT UP PEAK🙌🏾
season 3 is trash
HOW CAN U MAKE SEASON 3 SUCH A BORING AND STUPID SEASON THAT I WILL REGRET WATCHING , WHAT U GOT DISAPPOINTING UR FANS AFTER SUCH BANGERS LIKE S1 AND S2  😭🔪 bitch
Who's here after season 3
One of d worst season….totally boring
So whoes here after watching season 3?  This season seems a bit off idk why but the previous 2 were amazing this just alright...
Definitely a rushed season for us waiting so long. The first 2 seasons were better with better storytelling. This season was rushed into games without real context. They should’ve made it 8-10 episodes and added to the real plot of what makes the show in itself great.
Oh, man, this was boring. What happened? Did they change the director or something?
Chishiya....imp character 😢
GAIS A BABY WON
Spoilers!! I didn’t really like season 3. The secrets about Borderland were never resolved. Why go back to that place? I know she loves her Dad and misses him and all that. But what significance is her husband? Chopped liver?? And. I had to rewind it 50 times to understand what was going on. I quit watching when they were playing dice and going through different doors to their future. Maybe I will finish it up someday.
Was definitely happy to see Chishiya make a small appearance in the end. By far my favorite overall character.
Season 3 was superb🔥✨..... but I'm not interested in watching The American or Global version of Alice in borderland if there is a season 4......
Dude we deserve better ending, you could shown that aarisu was the main guy behind all this cz in season 1 starting we saw aarisu is sooo much into game stuffs and all so he made this game a virtual game and something like that aghhhhhhhhh we all deserve better ending c'mon man not fair 😭😡
Alice in Borderland S03 dekh ke lag raha hai jabardasti banaya gaya hai 😞📉. Season 1 aur 2 jaisa next level feel hi nahi tha. Arisu aur Usagi to hain, par jis wajah se show famous hua tha (Chishiya) usko last episode me sirf 20-30 sec dikhaya! 🕒 Uski presence hi show ka asli charm hai Agar S04 banana hai to purane sab characters lao especially Chishiya ko wapas lana hi hoga, wo hai to series hai, uske bina kuch bhi nahi❤🃏
"Omikuji" and "Zombie Game" were so interesting. It was well shown that Arisu was a smart character. I wanted to see how Arisu and the others cleared  "Runaway Train". If I could see more about how Arisu was thinking in the game in "Zombie Game", I would have been more satisfied.
Overall season 3 was a disappointment. Too much focus on games only and also completely ruined the suspense of season 1 and 2.
In this season i fckin hate usagi here.. Because of selfish desire to see her father she didn't realize she slowly sacrifice arisu in the name of her peace of mind a typical modern women Nowadays they will sacrifice their families for their own satisfaction 😏🤬
THE 3rd EPISODE WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST NETFLIX  EPISODES OF ALL TIME ....
Well why evey last season must be a disappointment?
Season 4 when soon 😮
I didn’t like the end , happy ever after tf ? It’s not what i expected , after all the suffering they faced , they continued bringing another child to the chaos lol
I miss chashiya 😢😢😢😢
Why their is no chisia ....and all ......their is no point without them ....the season is not feeling right without them ....if u wanted to include previous people at least include all survivors .......huh
Spoiler:      The baby became a player before it was even born?
Not satisfied.
Season 3 ending is horrible, worse than squid game season 2! If you have to watch, only watch the first 4 episodes in season 3!  I highly suspect it was the same writer who wrote both endings for squid game season 2 and alice in borderland season 3; otherwise, there's no sensible explanation of why it could go so bad!
Who is here after watching season 3? 😁
Greatest show ever, period.
Pr Alice in borderland season 2 best tha
We got chisiya back for like 10 seconds of screen time!!! I'd consider that a W since we weren't expecting him at ALL.
Bro
Who is coming here after it's release😅
We don't want an American version!
I LOVE THIS SHOW CANT BELIEVE ITS REALLY OVER🥲
Alice in Borderland ❌ Arisu in Borderland ✅
alice in borderlands season 3 is out! idk is this a plothole. we found out in season 2 ending. alice in borderland was just limbo/purgatory and you win you get to live. you die you dead. you choose to stay. your also dead. and get to play the game again until you die for good again. terrible choice imo. but anyway. so how does that explain the magical snipers in the sky? are they reapers or angel assassins in spaceships hovering the limbo earth or something? like wtf. that made zero sense to me.
meh, too much unncessary drama dragging the season to length with a rather senseless ending, no more next season for me regardless of whether they decide to churn out another one or not....
1:46 BRING IT!
I watched the end and man... Nah just like in Squid Game, Americanism in the end... like bfr can any series just end in original country where all started to not mention America in it.
sitelre nezmana gelir acaba
👎👎👎
Squid Game copied the Japanese anime Kaiji. Even the director of Squid Game admitted it.
It was good
2 episode missing
The writers for the last 2 episodes suckkkkkk
S3 begins on a high note and the ending is something else.
Alice in borderland without the Goat(Chishiya) is a crime.
What did the producers smoke while writing the script lol I have no idea what was story about
This season 3 i don't like ,no old characters, Osaki roll not good in season 3
Season 3 is very boring
Y’all just had to ruin a perfectly good show. Not everything needs to be turned into a love story, it’s so predictable, lazy and honestly boring. The games were trash and the plot felt like filler.   I don’t know if this came from the book or not, but if it did, then the book is garbage too. And if this season was just some new “original idea,” then I’m even more disappointed. Stop forcing love stories into shows and making everything so painfully predictable
Season 1 3♣️ 5♠️ 7♥️ 4♣️ 4♦️ 10♥️  Season 2 K♣️ J♥️ 7♠️ Q♠️ K♦️ Q♣️ J♣️ J♦️ K♥️ K♠️ Q♥️  Season 3 🃏 🧧🔥🏹 🧟‍♂️💉 🚉☣️ 🗼 🥫💣 📺⌚ 🃏🃏 Alice
FYI, To anyone wondering why Chishiya and Kuina isnt in season3. Nijiro Murakami the actor of Chishiya is tending for his mental health, he suffers severe mental health issue and is not available during the shooting of season 3, while Aya Asahina the actor of Kuina is pregnant during the shooting of season 3.
This season was a disappointment for me honestly... Was not feeling connected to any new players, everything was rushed and storyline was just not good 😭. This was one of my favourite shows, it's kinda ruined. I want the old characters back
I enjoyed this season. This season is not bad imo but not that great either. Idk. Season 2 was the best imo. This season feels rushed. Only 6 episodes 😢. I want to know more about borderland. Did they defeat joker or not? The airship didn't blow up. I have questions.
We're not doing justice to this series 😢
No one literally no one  Who comes here after watching aib3
It seems like a filler season to me  Btw enjoyed the games except that last one future smt that is so boring Btw when season 4 coming  That cliffhanger at the last alice girl  Got me now I am more eager abt season 4 😅😅
I still haven’t recovered from the impact of the series, and I honestly thought season two was the end. I was truly happy with that. This is probably the first time in my life that I’ve been sad about the existence of a new season of a show.  Anyway, I really wish Netflix would stop adding those ugly explicit scenes — I spent more time pressing the skip button than actually watching the important moments!  I also hope the ending will be a happy one. I don’t want anyone to die, but it seems like Arisu might. And if Chishiya and Kuina won’t be returning, then I hope there will be new friends instead to support Arisu and Usagi.
Soo the alice is a girl and season 4 comes again
Im already done watching the season 3. And I would like to say, most death there are well deserved. Super annoyed of Yuna, Sohta, and Nobu.
Netflix, please don’t touch original projects, you’re not doing well with them. This is the most boring season, the characters feel like dumb NPCs, the script and dialogues seem like they were written by schoolkids, and overall it’s just really, really bad. Only 6 episodes, but I strongly recommend everyone not to waste their time watching it."
That's from name Janpan
Η τρίτη σεζόν είναι για τα σκουπίδια όπως ήταν κ το squid game, ξεκινάνε ωραία δυναμικά αλλά ή καταλήξει τους στο τέλος είναι για κάδο κατευθείαν, αυτό.
الجزء الثالث بايخ جدا  3 ist very Bad
Bhai koi india se hey kya ❤
Must you people overdo? Just end tf at season 2 it ended well already and made sense. The script is already childish at this stage
for the complainer : its not technically a baby. its a fetuses
Best show everrrr
Ahhhhh!!!, Yes finally season 3 💞😩🙏💖
First 2 seasons 10/10 3rd season 8.5/10
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
We want season 4 👇Vote
who is here after watched the whole season 👇
There is a reason why people say Alice in Borderland is better than Squid Game :))
Just finished season 3 lol... All I can say is that, it messedddd with my emotions greatly loll
Need a season 4!!
Alice in Borderland is now available in Loklok
season 3 is very uninteresting, it's like squid game
i love it! best series this is so witty games
Was that the final season?
SEASON 4
Happy ending Hurrrrayyyyy
whos here after watching season 3 banger?
Where's Chshiya
Alice In Squid Games. 😂
Miss you chisiya 😢😢😢
What a way to ruin an awesome show. First 2-3 episodes are nice, then it’s just bleh. Asking us to invest in huge melodrama without giving characters any development and screen time. Big mess.  I couldn’t be bothered to watch finale with both eyes 👀 imagine that.
It feels so empty after finishing the season 3.
who here after finishing season 3
bro what happened to his hair bruh they need to go back to the old one
Season 3 like squid games where culprit comes n pass the Joker card
Little did we know, ARISU ABD USAGI DONT DIE???  WHY DID YOU TRICK US NETFLIX, WHYYYY
Just terrible compared to the other two seasons. The jump between games where they're in the middle of the games already with barely an explanation and it seems like they're rushing through to finalize the plot in just six episodes horrible disappointment compared to the other two.... horrible
Thank goodness, the ending was amazing! Arisu didn't pull a Gi-Hun.
Coming back here after watching the whole season, and reading all these weird comments and predictions. 🍿
Finally time to be watch this masterpiece 👹💀
tuff
tbh I didn't like the ending of s2 since everything was in their heads, the memories, the games, THE KISS. everything. Even their bond. "But they recognized EACHOTHER!" no they forgot eachother
7/10 show no sugarcoating..Not capture the anime spirit
Best season of the time !!!!!
💙💙
Just finished watching, it was great! I don’t think that one copied another but it was interesting to see the story had similarities with Squid Game. Such as them returning to the games, the baby stuff, the ending etc.
everything was AMAZING but the american setting at the end WTF I wanted to off myself. It should’ve been set in the Uk if anything because Alice in wonderland is set in britain?! So ass man everything was perfect until the end UGH
Didn’t realize that season 3 finally arrived🎉 although the season will be different, but ay, more cool episodes to watch, hope this isn’t fully consider part of the first two seasons, the ending of 2 was good but it did feel like a cut off.
Alice Arisu daughter ❤
RIP ALICE IN BORDERLAND you have been AMERICANIZED 🎉
aw too bad Chishiya and Kuina have only 20 seconds of screen time as well as anyone else I care about.  If you’re expecting to see your favourites prepared to be disappointed. 😢🎉 no time inbetween games to get to know any of the new cast. Hated them all. 🎉 Netflix had to shove their grubby hands up this shows anus 🎉
I am thinking now that there will be another one, which will be season 4,  after completing this film, because I suppose it will not finish yet.
There is connection between Alice in Borderland and squid game   1) the baby 2) the last scene same place America 3) we have played these games before
Could Usagi's father be the Joker? It's kinda wild but remember the flashback when usagi asked him what his wish, he said "I hope there will be many mountains that have never been visited or discovered by humans." Then we saw Ann traveling and found a vast expanse of Mountains and she said "this isn't the world i know" Telling us that such thing never actually exited in real life Japan, if a GM can create some kind of game arena could that be usagi's father's? Of his biggest wish and dream before he "died"
Great season but why th usa sequel it’s so pointless
This season sucks ass😂U have to die and the afterlife you entered revisit has the games too. Hard pass😂 Should've ended at season 2
مسلسل لازم يدرس في الجامعات what a masterpiece ستبقى أفضل عمل ياباني عندي بالراحة
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING S3 WAS PEAK😭🙏
The last episode of season 3 has a crazy plot twist bro, Arisu dodges death a lot of times.. That scared me so bad.
It was shot terribly.      The first two seasons followed the manga closely and were smooth and enjoyable to watch. But the third season completely ruined this IP. If they don’t want to make a sequel, they shouldn’t force it. Even if there are future sequels, I won’t watch them anymore!
What a masterpiece.❤
Lot of scenes from this trailer isn't there in the series.
Hear me out guys this is really Banger a bit confusing but let me tell you do not care about some negetive reviews for me season 3 episode 5 was 10/10, overall Netflix cooked with this one
Omg bro this arisu sometimes looks like a horror monster from a short ad😭
Spoil alrert. Some of the games in season 3 are confusing as f especially the zombie game. You do need to rewatch some episodes to really understand.
i feel mixed comments for season 3, should i watch it?
This season was great but it's the worst out of the 3....no iconic charecters exept maybe kazuya
WORST EVER! SHOCKING RETURN!!
Is season 3 good?can anyone suggest me?
Who missed kuina😢😢
Im just watching Season 3. (Spoiler-Warning!) Netflix absolutely cooked with this, because the first game this season with the burning arrows is actually the first game in the manga, on which this series is based on. Very funny that they still relate on the original manga.
Finnally wait is over🎉
Okay hear me out, this is one of the best show ever. I could see the thought and effort that was put into the making. Like what, I never knew the population of the world or how many Lt of cow  blood makes milk. Respect to everyone in this movie. Best show ever!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
thanks for the spoiler?
amo
Season 3 was so peak 🙏🔥
AT 2:03 Spoiler alert             This isn't real. It's a screen arisu didn't die.
GUYS vote for season 4
Need a season 4
You ruined it too , we need next season
01:07 Okay, we got a scene from the OVA.
THIS SHIT IS SO ASS
in the end of season 3 ep 6 we also see chishiya , kunia. ann  and niragi but , season 1 or 2  is more amazed then season 3 ....But that's not what I'm thinking....
Yeah finally done watching..  Im satisfied..  The only problem is I wanted the episodes to b atlis 10 😫😫
Is anyone here after watching season 3?
1. Add a baby into the game.  2. End the series in the US. 3. Give a little hint about next season.                          ~Avg Asian series
Season 4 need ✌️
Just complete season 3 and  (spoiler)    chishiya and kuina and others just for second in last ep😢. End similar to squid game
Chishiya we missed you this season 😢😢😢
NO KUINA NO CHISHIYA NO AGUNI  NO NIRAGI  big mistake - I mean having a 5 second interview with them at last episode was boring. Even with Ann just making her sit there was dull.  And why did u HAVE TO DO WHAT SQUID GAME DO! WHATS THIS STILID  WHITE AMERICAN VERSION!!!!  JUST DO SEASON 4 of this man!!!!!  Forget americanising this!!!! Keep this!!!! Just say TOKYO WILL FIGHT BEIJING OR SOMETHING OR WHATEVER BUT DONT SAY WE HAVE TO FOLLOW ALICE MAN
I am 120% bricked up!
Even though s1 and s2 were best they did a good job in s3 too it was superb.. but the new characters were not able to make an impact on us as they did in the previous seasons but overall it was good and i enjoyed it well and the last scene of chishiya really made me happy...
At first I thought his death is real
is one of the worse alice in wonderland season 3, is the same problem squid game 2. dont watch it
"ALICE" In Boarderland
Who's here after watching the series, thank god they included chisiya at the last
Maine dekhaaaaa ❤😮
Release date??
Just watched episode 1 and I’m kinda disappointed that there are only 6 episodes after such a long wait. Was hoping there to be 8. 😢 Can’t wait to finish season 3.
The first game already crazy. Insane 😱 and they have season 4 coming soon. Wth!
Completed the series. Was great ❤ Thanks for the happy ending ❤
❤
3 season September ??????
Were thinking of having zombies 😅😂
Wow wow what a beautiful season ❤
ABSOLUTLY LOVED THE ENDING WHEN ALL THE S1/2 CHARACTERS CAME BACK FOR 3 SEC OF SCREEN TIME TO SERVE FACE
Who's here after watching it?
I've watched it amazing 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
We played these games before - another baby as a player man this is the worst way it could have gone and without Chishya  man what a disappointment
I feel like season 2 was a perfect ending, I don't know why you make season 3
Bro that was a dream after all
The games were honestly disappointing—there was barely any intelligence behind them. Imagine if, when Arisu was injected, Ann, Kuina, and Chishiya had been by his side. Seeing the blood come out of his mouth, they could have injected themselves at the last second and joined the game too, fighting alongside him and winning together. That would’ve been so much more powerful.  And in the climbing game, instead of those random girls, what if the journalist had taken their place? She could have encountered Usagi, making her finally believe in her father. Adding scenes like that would have given the story much more depth and emotional impact.
i just finished it, and i loved it SO much, can’t wait for the edits to start pouring in
Omg this trailer is a heart difficulty 💔💔
The way you present is worth sharing I will definitely recommend this.
Who is here after watching season 3?
Ho lee shet. It's today.
Just finished it! Masterpiece!
Chishiya scene at the end ...goose bumps...get well soon  Nijiro Murakami
Cool lm ready to watch it went it comes back
1:10 118, brace for impact!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It was alright but my favourite chisiya missed him alot
I’m so excited for season 3!! Squid game can’t even compete with this show! 🤩🤯
Came back right after finishing the series.... I'd say it was quite fascinating at the same time a lil upsetting cuz i expected some more appearance of old casts...  Hope there's more of it coming❤
Sadly Disappointed.
YELLS
People need to get educated and realize AinB manga released years before SquidGame even existed LOL
Just one Question, Why ??
English Dub is frkin trash
They both survived
season 1 👌 season 2👌👌 season 3 🤮😵‍💫
Watching this till 3am is absolutely worth it. Underrated movie, I love this show so much a good ending I didn't expect and such a unexpected plot twists that I ended up loving. And lastly, a good way to end the movie! Wow you've done it again Alice in Borderland 🔥🃏.
Is there chisiya?
Where is chishiya bruh 📉😑 very disappointed
5 years to end the story and it was all worth it. Season 3 is a 7.5 out of 10 imo.
não somos borderlends....
Where is chishiya...?😢😢😢
( 2:02 ) oh well 🤷 looks like Arisu is getting shot hm?
2:04 did he just get tasered!????

I bet they gonna sacrifice the baddie for the emotional damage to the audience, but the many character will live to show his suffering, it's just my speculations

Is that bando?
😢
Banda comeback 💀💀
Alice in Borderland on September 25, 2025 Who is watching me like this? 😅😂😂😅
There are two jokers ones banda and i think the other ones role would be different like he has only 1 shot in trailer and that too isn’t showing anything like he’s a villain so maybe i think his character would do some good
What if the baby’s hust a hallucination or he’s just imagining what life would be like if they survived or smth
Today is the day i m very happy

1:04 arisu lost control of his legs?
Tomorrow Is The Day
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is releasing tomorrow, and there’s no hype—it's really sad for Alice in Borderland. I still think the ending of Season 2 was perfect, and there was no need for Season 3, but I will still watch it to see what they have cooked, because, in the end, it’s Alice in Borderland😊😊 Trailer looks good I'm really hyped up 🔥🔥🔥
Alooo khalo
Can I know how many episodes are there in alice in borderland season 3
inb4 squid game ending arisu stays so usagi can go home.
i wish arisu wont die😢
absolute cinema
Why  I not see chishiya and kuina
If this goes just like squid game s3 I will be furious
We need chishiya in this session
just like squid game, arisu will die at the end....
LETS FUKING GOO
Wow!
Omggggggg😮
IVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE
Please dont end like squid game
1:38  wait I’m confused that’s usagi and a stranger 😭
1:45 chishiya😭
cmon 1 more day, I am so excited @Netflix
2:03 please who was that huhhh
Whare are the chisiya and quina
Chishiya nhi hai to season 3 nhi jai
Where is Chishiya bring him in the final season  🤌🏻🤧
WHERE ARE CHICHIYA AND NIRAGI?!?!?! 😭😭😭
1:32 usagi's father chilling
This better not have a reality check ending like gihun n his squid game…arisu and his borderland better do us justice after that gihun heartbreak
everyone is talking about arisu but where is chishiya or kuina where is everyone
2:03 Slow it down. It looks like a footage or a screen showing their possible futures. It looks like Usagi dying in Arisu's arms and then he gets lasered. I hope that's the case.
I personally just want more of it. Yes it may backfire but my word it was entertaining, after all waiting what 2 yrs for season 3 or something. Anything could happen.
Ah shit, here we go again
The other Joker is hidden (Black and White).  Don forget that 2 people accepted to become citizens.
Love this series
It's so cool to see they took the fire arrow "game" from the anime. I've always wondered what it would look like in the live action show.
Butttt where is chishiya he was the most voted character 😢😢
Squid game sucks comparing to this tbh
SQUID GAME 3 FANMADE
is chishiya not in this season then banda will gone too ....the story is so different
Just 2 days? Wow 💀
NAHH DID I SEE A B-BABY?!!?
Bro pov squid game is mad that he copys
2 more days to go
arissuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!
is that a danganronpa reference
Wow 😍👏👏👏👏
WHYYY DIDNT YOU SHOW KING OF HEARTS!!!!!!!!!!
So this must be based on Alice in Borderland: Retry Manga.
Budget went crazyyy!! I hope the storyline is good too
2 days!
Season 2 was perfect ending for me left with mystery is good way to stop will hope this doesn't flop 🙏
At 2:04... was that Arisu?😮
No other survival series can match the level of this masterpiece 💀🔥
I AIN'T GONNA ACCEPT THE ENDING IF ARISU OR USAGI DIES BROO
I KNEW BANDA WAS THE JOKER !!!!
1:38  Hold up
Can't wait to watch it 100 times like season 1/2 the best 😊
I'm too hyped for this
It's increasingly clear that these worlds are elaborate man-made simulations, likely set in the distant future, created either for scientific study, entertainment, or both. The characters within them are not mere artificial constructs, but transferred consciousnesses of real beings, repurposed to inhabit these synthetic realities. Trapped in endlessly looping scenarios that shift and evolve, they are powerless to break free or halt the cycle. Their existence is condemned to perpetual repetition, continuing until the simulation either crashes, is deliberately shut down, or collapses by some unforeseen failure.
They better not make this into 2 parts 😅
is this still follows the manga?
4 days before the release...
NOOOOOO MY FAV CHARACTER  1:48
If the final act is full pf stupid decisions… I’m gonna tweak 😂
3day laft
Arisu you will not be de**
Naaah it's different than the manga sequel
The blue haired girl is already my favourite character , since Chishiya won’t be in this season.
PEAKKKK
Where is legend chisiya ☹️🙄😤
I just watched the show yesterday and finished it and now theres a season 3 must be tough being u guys
i literally just realized bc ive been so focused on chishiya and kuina not being in s3 trailer, wheres aguni and heiya 😭😭 me and the 7 other aguni likers 😭
I loved this series! I'm watching again, but it's soooo slow, they could have cut half of it.
Season 1 and 2 were brilliant, but I’m glad they continued. Hopefully it delivers!
Just few more days the season will be out
0:58 ok who the heck is this girl?
The fact prob niragi Will be in this season too is so scary, how a human can survive that: being shot , burned and kicked
Season 2 was good  Season 1 was the BEST But season 3 is just as good at 2 or a little bit more good  Season 1 is the BEST for me
please Chishiya, appear in atleast a cameo 🙏 ( Tho its fine if he doesnt what matters is nijiro’s health but STILL)
i lowk miss arisu’s “i haven’t showered in three years” look
i can't wait........
İ can’t waaaiiiiittttt
I can t wait, lets go!!!
Wait that raining fire arrows is a callback to the first game ever played in the anime
‏‪2:04‬‏ Don't say this is a burn
Anyone whose read the mangas, knows this looks bad
where is the goat?
did just the timer get over 3????!
☺☺☺
1:43 it's zombie
1:43 it's zombie
GUYS, THIS WONT END LIKE SQUID GAME. ALL THE GAME THAT ARE GONNA BE PLAYED ARE CANON IN THE MANGA, ITS GAMES THAT WERENT SHOWN BECAUSE ARISU DIDNT PLAY IN THEM. THIS IS HIM GOING BACK TO FINISH THEM
👍🏼🔥
I feel it unnecessary. Not just the story was wrapped up nicely on the end of season 2, but it was the end of the manga as well. They are out of source material. This story was not meant to be continued. So, in the end, they wrote the story of this final season forcing a finished story to continue. Still can be good but the bad sings are there.
This series is better than squid game
Idk why people keep talking about Squid Game... was Alice in Borderland ever an allegory for capitalism????
Who are watching before sep25 , waiting so badly
Sasta Squid Game 😂
Kelihatan nya enak
2:04 STOP I NOTICED THIS PART SO CLOSELY N REALIZE THAT GIRL MIGHT BE USAGI LAYING DOWN 😭
is that his brother? is he the joker?
They explained everything not like F society and from
I swear if gi-hun possesses ARISU and makes him sacrifice himself for a random ahh baby I’ll crash out
*I think the joker villain  is ACTUALLY THE MURDERER guy*  who participated in game of the neck collar (made by a psychopath) alongside chihisya & the candygirl !
2:03 WAS THAT ARISU
> “Squid Game = Popularity ❤️‍🔥😲 … Quality 🤡 … Overall 💩🦴 Alice in Borderland = MASTERPIECE 😎🔥 SG fans just chase money and cheap shocks, while AIB hits your brain, heart, and soul with strategy, emotions, and life lessons 😏💥 Nothing in SG can even touch the depth of AIB. Wake up, people! 😂😎
I said to god if arisu pulls a "we arent cards we are humans and humans are..." ill kms
Mark my words Umagi is joker 🃏
Loved the energy in this video.
BRO WHERES CHİSHİYA AND KUİNA
I'm getting suspicious about Ryuji(the guy with the wheel chair) because the joker card likes playing twisted games maybe he is the joker? Because I think he will act as nice and innocent guy then there will be a plot twist that he is the  villain
Korea and Japan just save the babies in there series
Where is chisiya
Is Chisiya Coming back??
I have forgot the season 1 and 2 story. So, I need to watch at least the season 2 before to start season 3. I remember they wake up in a hospital at the end of season 2. Can someone brifly tell about season 2 ending so I don't need to watch season 2 again.
げぇむからゲームに変わったのはなんか意味あんの？
Please dubbed in telugu
SEASON 3!!!?!!!
Y'all noticed how it doesn't say final season but just season 3. Do y'all think that if season 3 does well, we'll get season 4???
Instant like.
Where is chishiya 😢
At last. The real squid game.
IM SO EXICTED FOR THIS
Now one more baby .......
Counting down the days <3
Please dubb telugu language 😢
If arisu died cause of baby🥀🥀
I saw a baby and immediately lost hope 🥀
NOOO I MISS HOMELESS ARISU WDYM HE GOT EMPLOYED AND TOOK A SHOWERRRR😭😭😭
Where is chishia ??????
2:03 is he gonna die??
I doubt there will be a baby in the show. In the scene, there are lights on, while it's known that in the borderlands there is no electricity generated anywhere but in the games. Arisu also looks too clean compared to what it’s been showcased, and the person with the face not showed is probably Arisu himself, contemplating some sort of hallucination probably.
So guys ,arisu dies  End of story😢
Where is chisiya😢😢
I swear if chishiya is not gonna be there and a fckin baby wins again and arisu pulls out a "we are not horses..." bla bla im fckin gonna smack this series ass off and kms
bro im so glad theyre bringing back the games from the manga and the anime, they were so cool i was dissapointed when I didnt get to see them originally
what is the title of the music in the start? please answer
Wait so there really is no Chishiya and Kuina? I thought it was rumours 😭
Where's a guy with hoodies and hand in pockets ? 🥹
1:04 WHYS IS ARISU IN A WHEELCHAIE NONONOO
2:01 did usagi and arisu just get shot ISTG OMFG
Way more better than Squid show. The last Squid show was so predictable, not very well thought.
2:03 I think it's joever 💔
We are not Card we are humans And humans are.... 😂
I just finished watching s1 and s2. I thought that the show doesnt need a s3, but after watching this, I'm sat, there is only 7 days left. I think I should rewatch ep 8 of s2 again, since S3 will obv talks about fate and the endless possibilities which is a thing that the queen of heart talked about. I'm not sure tho
🥺🤍
Chishya
Just one week, we need to wait one more week...Oh gosh, I'm so freaking excited for this season!!!!!!
Truly excited for this web show
Chisiya 😂
Arisu gonna pull the famous Gi hun face from squid game
I think they are pulling a Gi-Hun, Arisu literally says "I don't care if I die if there's a chance to save Usagi."
Fire Arrows, that was supposed to be the First game in the OVA anime right?
0:17 is he the guy on jack of hearts game? cuz aside from chischiya, there are 2 more who survived the game and if im not mistaken, yaba and banda was the name of the two.
dai arisu va potradhinga da dai😭😭😭
Wait Where is our chishiya 😭😭..The show is incomplete without him ..
The story ended well now why season 3
This looks very good im actually excited
My prediction : Everyone will start living a normal life except Ann who will remember what happened as she had died in the borderland and came back into the real world as kuina held hands with her while coming back....she will be researching and trying to know more about the borderland....then Usagi will meet an accident and again be strangled between life and death...As soon as Ann tells Arisu about the borderland games , he will request her to send him back into the games to help Usagi and they will be playing the games again.....
Istg if aib copies squid game im never watching either ever again
I loved Season 1 and 2, its better than Squid Game IMO. Can't wait to finally watch S3!!!
That line of "beyond the border" makes me think this is based on Border Road. If it is Arisu is safe
Available in Telugu
Chisiya??
i have a bad feeling should this season
8 DAYSSSSSS!!!
not the "if my fav character isnt in this i wont watch it" type of guy but im gonna be sad if chishiya and kuina arent in here 😭😭
I cant believe wonderland/borderland is actually a coma world 😭
Aguni and chishiya?? Ann is back why aren't they 😭😭
Faltan casi  8 días para que se estrene
Chishiya were is care
Missing chishya 😢😢
Nahh Im sad. Chishiya and Kuina not being here makes it feel like the squad is incomplete.
season two already end well.. season three will ended on a cliffhanger..
Just me who thinks this looks disappointing?
Season 2's ending was literally so good, why the heck do they want to end it sadly by bringing another Season
without Chishiya!!! 😊💔
Not only on Netflix 🫣
I swear on my life if arisu dies hes gonna pull like gi hun
I advise everyone to boycott Netflix. I had paid for 4 months in advance with cards and Netflix terminated my account... I then paid for 1 month by credit card and a week later, disconnected... And when I tried to contact Netflix customer service, it said unavailable...
Where is kuina, chishiya, niragi, aguni, heiya😭 I can’t watch the series without them
Dubb in telugu language
I'm sorry but it didn't need a season 3
WHERE IS CHISHIYA???
Did they just spoil arisu to die in the finale?! The ending says it all! 2:02
Not watching without Chishiya, Niragi and Kuina.
In the teaser we could see arisu dying and usagi saying "arisu" but im pretty sure they wouldnt really show hus death in a teaser so its probably just a dresm lr illusion like in squid game
no chishiya = no alice in borderland
This looks underwhelming already. They should have ended it at season 2.
Please end the baby. It already has 45.6b won it doesnt need to survive the borderland ✌️😭🥀💔
Where's Chishiya tho
This show's writing is much much better than Squid Games so I'm sure it's going to end well.
If Airsu dies in this season,I’m suing then killing myself..
I want see naked man...
2:03 did arisu die or what
Don't worry , they are following the manga , in manga , arisu , usagi , chisiya and some other characters survived
The best series of this year.
Chinsiya❤❤❤❤
FINALLLYYY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
peak, absolute cinema, squid game is not even close
wow inception 😮
Chishiya is my brother and cishisiya is in 3.season❤
Looks good actually but well see, im rooting for it. It might be the ending the fans deserve..
WTF IS CHIShYA😊
1:08 real goosebumps
Is this squid game cuz I know no context about this movie
NAHHHH The ending of season 2 was absolutely perfect  and the cliff hanger left it to the imagination of the viewers . I hope this season doesn't ruin that ending .
I literally have been waiting for season three for so long and I didn’t even know about the announcement until randomly. I thought, I wonder if they sent out a trailer and then boom! There it was posted two weeks ago! good timing, I guess.😭
Ka aayegi yaar ❤❤❤
I'M SO MF EXCITED, I CAN'T EVEN EXPRESS HOW MUCH HOPE I'VE FOR THIS SESSION CAUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT since FOREVER!!! lessss gaurrrrrrr, only 11 days to goo
WTF , where is chisiya..?
This guy is the one from jail game
Arisu is dead ? 😢
No i saw a baby please no not again im begging you please dont happen again🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
1/10 BO NIE POLSKIEGO
AIB is from a manga. squid game isn't so stop comparing their ending 🤷🏽
Can anyone tell me where the heck Chishiya and Aguni
О боже! Да да да! Как же я этого жду!
02:03 😮
This better be a good ending or I'm never watching kdrama again...because I'm still recovering from squid game season three 😢💔
I finished new "Alice in Borderland Season 2" with my sister...
😢
Finally Banda vs Arisu 🔥
I think that scene in last is just a possibility they are showing just like the one with the baby it is not real otherwise they wouldn't have added that in the trailer
if chishiya is not in s3 i not gonna watch this
...I mean, I still rewatch the first 2 seasons with new people I can talk into giving the series a shot lol... it's just such a well-rounded story as it is already, with the genius ending in season 2, and everyone I watched it with also ended up fascinated by the show! ...but also content with how it unfolded. ...but as a fan, no matter how much I appreciate the original 2-season-long storyline, I just CANNOT complain about MORE of the good stuff, like?? Sure, give me a season 3!! I might not treat it as canon in my head, but even a slightly 💩ier Alice in Borderland is better than NO more AiB ever! (I'll never understand fans of certain shows/movies complaining about getting MORE stuff to watch, like??) The original still remains the masterpiece it is, and you get some additional stories with the same great characters in the same awesome world, why not...? Alice in Borderland, I'll def be tuning in!!
This is sooo different that the manga version of the third part, I can't wait to see what happens and how Arisu is going to live, as we know he will.
I just hope the reason for these games is clarified once and for all.
I hope Arisu and Usagi lives. And also I hope many survivors would be okay too, especially Arisu's brother and family since they're going to participate too. 😭
I can't Imagine season 3 without Chishiya
Season three is without chishiya and kuina?
Spolier alert Final winner-Usagi
Arisu at the end: We are not cards, we are humans (laser kills him)
What do you mean by Alice in Bonderland without Chishiya?😭
Cant wait for this‼️💯
Where is master mind ?
Nah, I don't have faith in this.
I'm scared to watch it 😮‍💨
What! Is Arisu going to die in season 3!? 🤯😮‍💨😤
I hope everyone dies, expect the baby who wins the game.
I used to make fun of my friends for simping for anime characters with mile long rap sheets, but every time I see Yaba and Banda laugh I’m like 🥰🥰🥰 kickin’ my feet and shitttt, so I get it now LOL 💀
they fighting jedis instead of king of cards now
Praying that Ann has a larger role in S3 than just helping Arisu get back into Borderland 🙏🙏 I really wanted to see her kick ass in more games🥲☹️
Ok, this is too much to handle
Temu Squid Game
Where is aguni?
Is the third season going to be the final season of the show?
No babies, no babies, no babies🤞🤞
Arisu better pull an "we are not Cards nor Toys we are humans and humans are..."
Bro I better not end up depressed like when I saw squid game 3
Istg if the baby wins I’m gonna crash out
Chiciya kaha hain
Where is chishiyaa we need chishiyaa😢😢
In the past Japan made the best films in Asia, starting with Kurosawa. Then Hong Kong with the Kung Fu, Wuxia genre, Shaw Bros, Woo's Heroic Bloodshed movies, then S.Korea with it's boring soap dramas, zombie movies and dark thrillers. Now we are back to Japan cinema again.
The last part, dont tell me the whole story is just arisu's dream
SO EXCITING!!!
So excited
I am so exitet about the New season Alice in Borderland is back!
secret boss coming
BEST
チシヤ出ないんだ？
Can anyone explain the real story behind the borderland
1:47
Is this an original storyline? Cause season 2 ended right where the manga end.
2:04 i swear if arisu dies ima go to alice in borderland to die
AIB is easily one of the best drama Japanese or not.
Korea completely plagiarized many Japanese movies, dramas, mangas eg Squid Game copied Liar Game, Kaiji and God's Will. All of us are Dead copied the anime High School of the Dead. Sweet Home's concept was copied from Japanese movie Sweet Home 1989 and hundreds more.
The inclusion of a Korean actor completely ruined this for me. There's no reason for it to happen except for pandering to the Korean market or Kdrama fans.
We are  not cards we are  horses mehhhhhhhheehehehe
ITS THE BEST
WHO THE BABY? IT BETTER NOT BE USAGIs AND ARISUs!   I swear if I see chisiya pull a saebyeok minor appearance to help arisu with his decisions broooo
Great was watching S2 now there will be a 3rd one
Lack of Chishya scares me.
Gamuuu....Start tuu❤
I read the news that Nijiro Murakami (Chishiya actor) might be or might not returning this final season due to personal reason but never say never in Netflix.because Chishiya story is not over
I'm surprised they have a s3, but I ain't mad at all! One of the best series ever
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS SEASON!
Yall glazing squid to much in the comments💀 I wonder who’s the joker card
arisu better not die omg...
omg theres a two of hearts 😝😝🤪🤪🤪😜😜
This show better not end with a white trash unlike squid game.
Just finished both the seasons of borderlands in 8-9 hours. Loved season 2(10) more than season 1(8) was such a journey. Especially the last 2 episodes of season 2
I am waiting for 3 💯🎯
i swear if that baby...
142 chisiya voice
Where is chishiya
if ts ends up like squid game im quitting my netflix subscription cause i live for arisu nd usagi
It seems like usagi was supposed to be in coma and went to the borderland and arisu came to win the game and rescue her..Then there wouldn't be any of our favorite characters from season 1 and 2 as they'll have been saved..including chishiya quina and all🙂🥲..Ann was saved later and I guess she remembered the event and helps arisu to save usagi
As a huge fan of the manga I’m super excited for this one. I thought that was it and season 2 covered the end of the books.
wow
2:03 if that's arisu dying...
CHISHIYAAAAAAAAAAA
Is this based off of the sequel manga re:try?
Oh my gosh ! It’s happened!!! Season 3. I got so emotional watching this trailer. Such a good trailer though. I am so excited I love season 1 and 2 so I don’t want to bring such high expectation to this season. I’ll patiently wait for it. I’m so glad they still faithfully stay with the borderland concept.
FINALLY
YES FINALLY
They changed the whole vibe 😢
2:08 WHOS BEHIND HIM?!?
Yeaaahhh season 3 is coming I will watch
1:42  ZOMBIE???
Soo is that mean Banda is the main  dealer?
Where is chisiya😢
I swear to God if bro dies...
Knowing how the modern internet changed people and the shows, I hope this wouldn't be a cliffhanger flop or anything similar to the korean netflix shows
I don’t know if I can do this again guys……🫩🫩🫩🫩💔💔💔💔
I can already sense the squid game ahh ending💀
What about chishiya
I'ma need 20 more seasons of this by the end of the year
Let it not have sad ending like squid game
Best
Arisu's hairstyle changed, I didn't recognise him at first 😭
2:03 you can see a laser going straight through arisus head… 😳😮
DID I ACTUALLY SEE ARISU DYING AT THE END....
And where is chishiya he was also alive in last episode 🤯
There is a salseman it's this game like squid game?
I dunno what the hell is wrong with my eyes, had to check if the guy at 1:01 wasn't Jensen Ackles
Ah, the Jimbo card
I wish that he rememorises everything again
So excited
When is weak hero 3 ?
Flop Without Chishiya 😢😢
cant wait
hope to see Shuntaro Chishiya alive
Yes!
I thought all this happened in a coma
Why do I keep getting " Sword art online vibes + multiverse of madness vibes from this trailer ? 😂
Where is chisiya
Arisu died?
Well, it's not about the Squid Game..but i don't understand why people are so mad at the Squid Game ending. In my opinion, it was really good and Gi Hun and the baby made it even better; didn't see any problem about it. If anything similar happens to AiB, I would actually be liking it, no matter what.
Not gonna watch if chisiya is not in this season, but but this season looks 🔥🔥🔥💀
Bring the series in hindi plz
Banda is The Joker ?
Hope vs despair?? Wrap it up gang this isnt danganronpa damn 😭
ngl i like the game where u duck under the  laser thingy
I love how people who escape a death game always find their way back.
Where I can watch except Netflix?
Plot twist the game master is chishiya and his accomplisher si Kuina (I'm just delulu don't mind me)
plot twist, the baby win the game
most of the games are so crazy dawg
THEY ADDED THE ORIGINAL GAMES FROM THE MANGAA
He is fujimi no sugimoto!
"GIHUN-IFIED Arisu theory" intensified in the comment.
I think arisu dies and no  high hopes but i will still watch it.
Let's gooo!!!
Finally ❤
Yaaaay
Ngl the trailer looks fire
Yooo sep 25 is my birthday
Where is chishiya
ew this is not my arisu he looks e- e- employed 🤢
kento yamazaki
if this ends like squid game then be sure I m coming for y all
YYYEEESSSSSSSSSSSßSSS
Dopamine high❤
1:29 Umbrella Corporation????
im tired of these babies man💔.
❤❤❤
My theory is that there will be two more season the second one being the end. Ace cards were never mentioned, and ace cards can be higher or lower than face cards, so either the joker first then ace cards or other way around.
When ?
Whaaaaat!
I really hope there’s another one of those montages of a bunch of games so there can be more games
i just know i’ll be rewatching it because it’s just such a good show, one of my favourites
Chishiya😢😢
I feel like this trailer spoils way too much about the story, stopped watching after 45 seconds in
1:38 hmm i really wonder whos suriving......
So many spoilers in a single  trailer
arisu nooooo😢
i think i change my mind at 2:03…….
if arisu pulls a gihun im done
It seems like that joker is hayato
so is the serial killer dude from s2 the joker? orrr…
PLEASEEE ARISU DONT DONT DONT DIEEEEE
i swear is arisu dies im sueing netflix
This should not have been continued tbh
ALICE without Chishiya is NOTHING.
Who is this clean man and where did Arisu go?
I'VE PLAYED THESE CARDS BEFORE
Anyone else annoyed they revealed the joker in the trailer?
1:16 Reminds me of someone
Don’t waste your time on this rubbish
Epic!
That joker can give ptsd irl if it exists
Yes I will binge watch all seasons on 25th September.
@netflix please stop making this kind of series. We are just fed up with seeing this kind of series.
Where is chishiya
Netflix you are a mad you can remove chisiya what happened😢😢
The banger is coming back
Where is my favorite character " chisiya "
please do better than the scupid squid game
Can someone read the manga tell me is this season a part of original story or its new written…
Inception
all that for +4 mult smh
I'M SO READY!
1:28 Por Balatro 🍷🗿
seneng sih dpt season baru tapi menurutku season 2 kemaren udh menjadi penutup yang baik tanpa perlu ditambah2in lagi T___T tkut zonk
why are there doors/portals to other realities 😭😭i hope those details really make sense within the established universe of the borderland because if its just some random new thing i will kms💔
omg s3 how did i just find this cant wait
hey so my babies chishiya and kuina not mentioned
Bro where is chisiya
So excited!!!
did they change the cast or just im tripping?
i didn't see chyshia or kuina and i'm scared
I think the blue haired girl is a citizen as we see in the teaser she smiled when she was playing with someone i think shes playing with idk but in the trailer we see her looking around in red stuffs i think she is a citizen
Why arise look is so change 😢
❤❤❤
HOLY SHIT THE ORIGINAL THREE OF CLUBS
This season better be good and not destroy everything 😢
IF ARISU PULLS A GIHUN NETFLIX SLEEP WITH 2 EYES OPEN
Imagine dying couldn't be me
Imagine dying couldn't be me
Hyun ju in Alice borderline
I’m hyped
Gi hun : i come back for an another person
Where is Chishiya ?
Is this another dream again? How am I to be invested if its not real?
QUE GANAS DE QUE SALGA.
IM TWEAKING!!!
Chishyaa
chisshyaa
Waiting🎉🎉❤
O bichinho do Arisu realmente terá apenas 2 minutos de paz, o resto... Bem...
Don't want an ending like squid game🥲
❤
Lets go!
The last shoot .... 😮
Season 2 was terrible, I couldn't even finish it. I loved the first season but man this just took a turn for the worse and I'm not even interested in seeing the end of this.
Aaaaaaasaassaaaassaaaaaaaaaa
who is the guy at 0:16? Is he the guy who decided to stay as the jack of hearts? The game that Chishiya played?
Trailer ❌ Spoiler ✔
Better than squid games
BRING BACK CHISHIYAAA
Hope chishiya is the joker
the is NO ONE talking about WHRE THE HELL IS AGUNI?
Mark my words usaki is joker i am from future ❤
Where did the usual protagonist go???? 😮 💔
Yokoso watishini soul society 😅
Is chishiya there in s3
Father of "Squid Game"...🔥
So excited. I hope this won't disappoint.
alice in the borderland > squidgame
For kids - Squid game  For legend - ALice in borderland
Not that mf baby Again 😭😭
Will it be a sezone 4 cuz i really eant it already
I am losing it if chishya is the joker
Yall Im not Able To watch It On 25 september Im Gonna Watch It Next Year Remind Me 😁
Waited years
so exciting
theres no point in having a season 3 without chishiya and kuina
Jokes on you🤣🤣🤣
God. This show is such cringe. How did they get it extended for more than 1 season?
I think after years usagi and arisu get married or are about to, but due to some incident, usagi goes into coma or something. To save her ann and arisu somehow figure out a way for arisu to go in borderland. He goes there, plays games, and maybe sacrifices himself for Usagi. And usagi lives while arisu dies.  Maybe they both survive too idk
omg i can’t wait to see this S3
I can't wait to see Usagi and Arisu again😻
Woah!!!! This is exciting 🎉🎉 Finally Finally Finally...its happening!!!! Lol i still remember when i had finished watching its s1 and s2 Which ended showing joker card..i asked my sister...why the joker card at the end? She said it means there will be s3 and i was waiting.... waiting.... waiting... Finally!! 🎉🎉
Hopefully both the main lead nv die in this new season. So this new season 3 , joker card game master happen to be the two psychopath player that want to stay inside the game.   Pray that its gonna be awesome and good ending.
this is insane better than squid game...
This doesn’t look like the manga
eughhh can't wait
Guys what the Frick was that 2:03
2:03 😮
6 episodes and a baby 💔 ive palyed these games before
A great live action adaptation of a manga doesnt exi...........
YESSSSSSS I CANT WAITTT
Ayanokoji FR FR
Season 1 Season 2 aura of chisiya 🥶 Season 3 aura of Banda 🥶
I swear our diva Tatta didn’t come back 🤧
FINALLYYY BRUH
Repent and give your life to Christ. 💕 The Bible says that Jesus is the way the truth and the life. Jesus is the only way to heaven. Trust in him and the fact that he died on the cross for your sins and you will be saved and receive the holy spirit. Then you will go to heaven to be with God and the rest of the other believers in Christ.💜
OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS HERE IT COMES
why is youtube waiting multiple days to recommend this to me bro
I've read the manga and the game that Usagi is playing with the gas mask is the two of hearts game. I'm excited to see these games finally be in live action. :)
I already lost hair while watching squid game s3, now im seriously going bald😊
THIS IS INSAAAANEEEEE
The better Squid Game
Again?!
The end of season 2 was fine. we dont need a season 3
This is bs, let them be happy for God's sake!
So they survived a meteor just to go back into the death games
i didint even know it was 2025 i thought it was somewhere in 2026 and i was gonna cry cause i saw it was made in 2014 and i thought the full show was released but it turns out im not alone and its literally the most watched japanses show ever on netflix
Where is chishiya
Why are they not speaking Korean anymore?
WHERE IS CHISHIYA ??
I'm 18 now but I watched this a while back and it's genuine fire. The second season is a bit meh at times but hopefully thay give it a better ending in s3 can't wait
2:03 please someone tell me that's not arisu!!!
We want chisiya 😢
Arisu ko jeevit rakhne ke liye prarthana patra
I mean, look at the end of the trailer, it is obvious that the one who got hit by the laser is Arisu...
Yeah im getting flashbacks
He is just gonna sacrifice himself for her to win
where is chishiya ?
what. didn't they died in the last season. I don't get it.
What about the ace cards
I don’t understand… are the games real? Are they in a simulation?? Was the meteor real ??? Like the Queen at the end of season 2 confused me even more bc she kept lying and going back and forth… where are Ann, Chishiya, & Kuina. I’m so losttt 😭😭😭 some help me pleaseeeeee
Pehh langganan netflix neh kii
Chishiya kaha h 😭😭😭😭😭
Excuse me? 2:02 ARISU DIED?
The psycho guy from Jack of Hearts game is a part of the game master now is it?
We want chisiya❤❤

I already know the girl with the blue hair pmo
This is gonna be soooo goodddd
Plsss don’t let die Arisu Don’t make Alice borderland as a squid game, sad ending, make it happy ending. We all hope Alice in Wonderland will be happy ending and he should be alive in the game also.
My whole back is tingling from shivers of excitement. Please be good 🤩🙏

As long as Arisu doesn't die, I'll watch
Season 2 ended with the most ominous joker card and everyone is saying to end it then and there???! Wtf is wrong with you people
The season 2 of Alice in Borderland seems like not great as the first season,hope season 3 can be better ,looking forward to that.
Arisu, do you still have faith in people?
There are 2 jokers…
I watched this series just to see my girlfriend ayaka miyoshi ❤
THERE'S ZOMBIES NOW?
We will miss chishiya😫💔
where is chishya? 😮
I thought they replaced the lead with Mackenyu when I saw the thumbnail.
I like how they added the fire arow game from the manga, it was actually supposed to happen in season 1 becuase it was the first game arisu and his friends played in the manga.
where my fav  chishiyaaaaaaa
I’m so ready
FINALLY. After waiting forever
If the third season is trash, remember it’s because of Netflix, and that it was supposed to end after season 2
I CANNOT WAIT
Looks like L is getting screwed over by Alain.
Chisiya and kuina plsssss
atleast the one buff dude is there
🎉🎉🎉
at what point they got married😭did they just live years normally and it was game all along-
Telugu dubbed please 🙏🙏🙏
Chishiya Kunia?
is that Sunato Banda?
netflix ran out of new and original ideas so they milk peak shows with season 3's. penthouse, squid games and now alice in borderland (and many more)
WHERE IS CHISHIYA?💔
Nope....not watching.  The end of season 2 was great.  This is just a cash grab that will ruin it for me.
Finally 😮❤🎉🎉 waited for very long time . Love it!
Tayang tanggal brpa di Netflix? Ini series juga, atau 1x tamat?
WHERE IS CHISHIYA
❤❤
0:30 to 0:40 ....Did anyone else think about "Inception" when watching this part?   So we have the games that were in the manga but never appeared like the train car game or were substituted  by original games like the flaming arrow fortune card challenge...as well as having some new games never before seen...and it's written and overseen by the guy who wrote the manga it's all based off of?  HELL YES!!!!  I have a feeling that while searching for Usagi and battling the new citizens of Borderland, Arisu will be stumbling upon various people sent to the Borderland by various different near death accidents akin to "AIB: Retry", and if that's the case, I hope "Alien Invasion" makes an appearance...I liked that game.   I cant wait to see what crazy stuff the Borderlands have in store for the "Death card" game...especially the one with the dice and the hologram room with the psychopathic serial killer turned Borderland citizen...I have a feeling that one is going to be very "Mysterio" style in levels of "what is reality?" even more so that the Queen of Hearts game was.
I swear if we get a whole sg season 3 sorta thing all over again ima tweak
i am not ready for this chat
Where is chisya.....😢 I miss him
Plz netflix bring all good shows in hindi dubbed
Is this series available in Hindi
Most awaited after squid games.
I wish chishiya was there🥺🥺
Thnku so much missing so much ❤
Where is Chisiya and kuina ?
Arey baap re arisu ki bhi fielding set kar di 😢😢
PLEASE GUYS!  THIS IS NOT SQUID GAME, ALICE IN BORDERLAND IS LITERALLY DIFFERENT, HOW YALL SO OBSESSSED WITH SQUID GAME
I am 100% sure that Chishiya will be back. A deck has 2 Jokers after all...
Can't wait ❤❤
Organic hit
How predictable 😂😂😂
Ouuuuu i'm scared i didnt even expect a S3 since it ended so perfectly 👀 does this happen in the manga/webtoon?
OMLLLL I'M SO EXCITEDDDDD HOPE USAGI SURVIVES OR I'M GONNA EXPLODE
i can't wait for this .....
Looks like inception
So what know another meteorite dropped or ?
Pls share tomrrow 😂
ss1 2 👍👍
Anyone else think the guy looks like Yuta from JJK?
I see a lot of people were not a fan of how Squid Games ended😂
Can't wait
ISTG IF A BABY WINS IMA CRASH OUT ISTG WHY ARE ALL THE BABYS WINNING GI HUN SACRIFICE HIMSELF NOW ARISU?
But why ?
2:02 WAIT DONT TELL ME THATS ARISU
Nggk sabar nyooo
Bad decision. Don't watch.
Bro they better let them all out stop playing with them😹
yey
Finally this show will get all the spotlight it deserves now that it doesn't have to compete with Squid Games. (FYI I prefer Alice in Borderlands MUCH MUCH more)
They cooked again
IM SOOO WAITING 🧘🏻‍♀️
وين عبدالرحمن الشهري
i read a manga that they went back to borderland, i forgot the title lmao.. i got spoiled wth
No chisiya?
i like this better than the fkng stupid game
Alice had a nearly Perfect ending.... Why Season 3°°°° makes no sense...
This is how it should be done.
Let. Stories. End.
Looks like my girlie Ann won't be playing the game ☹️
Best show I've ever watch way better than squid games
okay, this is interesting.It's new, 'cause manga ends in Borderline 2. Although there is a spin off from the MC, I don't think it is same.
i need to rewatch OMG this is FIRE!
i played this game before...... we are not cards we are humans and human are ......
Session to how to Netflix date
0:26 the arua line 😎🔥
Is it just me whos a normal fan who didn't come from squid game ?
I'm so excited!!!!!!!
I hope the story gets resolved this season so you don't ruin the series like what was done with Squid Game.
OUUUUUUUU I CANT WAIT
I CANT WAITTTTT 😭😭😭😭😭
very nice
Amazing
Baby?.. We are not players, we are humans. And humans are..
Yessssssssssssssss
These dudes can’t catch a break
My take from the ending of season 2 is that they never truly left the borderlands - hence the joker card. So Arisu seemingly opting to return in the trailer may be a bit of a Red herring
''We are not players, we are humans...humans are...'' ahh season incoming 💔
Wil season 3 be the last of Alice in Borderland?
izlemiyom gri abiyi geri getirin
I I am watch this trailer  2:4 AM on a night 🌃
Can’t wait!!
Whoo hoo can’t wait
I want all of us are dead s2
where's Chishiya?
Arisu dies in the end😢
THIS IS IT!!! PERFECT
Uhmm like didnt you see the last clip? HE LITERALY GETS LAZER TO HEAD💔
It's been a while since I had goosebumps like this. Glad this excellent series gets S3!
2:03 arisu sacrifice for usagi i recon
Can't watch if there's no Kuina
You gotta be kidding me you're not telling me that season 3 is all based on usagi and arisu BRO WTF OTHERS SURVIVED TOO i ain't watching no chishiya no kuina no aguni no niragi dude bfr
I think the games are just in dream of everyone but if you die in the game (dream) , you will be dead in the real world also
ON MY BURRFFFDAY ❤
I bet that the girl that they keep looking at here turns out to be their ‘future daughter’ (which will probably be a trick pulled by the joker)
Can't wait to see such a upgrade but Where's Chisiya please note thar the reason of popular this show was alone chisiya's style ❤❤❤
Oh hell yeah! Can't wait for this! Bring on the Joker!
did they rlly just spoil ts 2:02
Love seeing Kento Kaku from House of Ninjas in this. ❤❤
''despair or hope'' danganronpa will chase me for my whole life...
Visuals: wonderful 🔥🔥🔥
its gonna be blast 💥
Lets goooo 🔥🔥🔥
No chishiya, i am not watching
Alice: Inception :)
This is so freaking epic
Nooo Chisiya my nonchalant protagonist....
compare to squid game, this is night and day
It's available in tamil
Edutainment beats dry instruction for retention.
2:03 is that arisu😬
Alice In Borderland: Season 3 - Final Season | Official Trailer | Netflix
how many time i watch dis trailer i get obsessed
Usaggiiiiii!
Finally
Hey, give my man Arisu a break. He got out and now you're pullin' him back in with your Netflix fan-fic
Uuuh - season 2 ended along with the source material. So wth is this?
Is there Niragi and Aguni in season 3 ?
Chishiya :(
2:03 what the heck was that???😮
So sad Yuzuha Usagi won't be in season 3.
2:03 whaaaaat ?
Did just i see arisu got strike by the laser  If he die i will lose the  a faith for humanity
Netflix you better drop all episodes at once on 25th!
Most awaited ❤
Where is....
Is this show combination of Maze runner & interstellar
BRUHH AT THE END ARISE DIES
25 september  netflix server goes to down 😂😂
This isn’t my arisu why is he employed 😔💔
im not watching without Chishiya 😢
WAAAHH GILA GW MAKIN GA SABAR WOYY GAMENYA MAKIN GACOR
"Yokoso, watashi no soul society" - Aizen
Hell yeaaaaaaaaa
I am still curious about her father.. where is he?
I hope it doesn’t get to showy if that makes sense, the same thing they did to squid game, AIB first seasons was dark and gritty I hope it stays like that, I can’t FOOOOOOKINGGG WAIT SONNNNN
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🤘🤘
The season 2 wasnt the end ? Im confuse
Of all the cards they picked the Joker. Not the Ten, King, or even Ace of spades.
hey so lets not make arisu pull a Gi-hun and why is arisu employed and looks like he showers daily now...?
I’m so excited I can’t waitt
fr bout to be a better squid game than squid game
bro looks like chota
Japanese movies and dramas never fail to amaze me every time.
Arghhhhhhh can't waittttt
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!
WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE???? ALL THE CAST FROM SEASON 2??? HELLO???
I'm hoping why hair guy in it he stole the show
Alice in Borderland > Squid Game
Why does it feel like it's not going to be a happy ending?
Arisu in Midrandu
Looking forward to this one
😮😮😮
I’m so excited!!
0:08 I saw the same clip in another trailer, is Arisu playing the Seven of Hearts game again??
3 of clubs and 2 of hearts mentioned!
Telugu dubbed please 🥺
Telugu dubbed please 😢😢
damn ofc i cancel netflix, and they want me to sub again
Alice in borderland without chishiya and kuina😭😭😭
wow
Much Magic in a litle time Goooooood🔥🔥🔥😱
The release is in September 25
I dont remember shit, need a recap
OMG WAİT WHAT?
Wheres our king chishiya
What is this movie on
are they milking it?
PEAK IS FINALLY BACK 🥹🥹🥹
Gamer’s attendance🔥
Let me know when the whole thing releases i am not watching 2 episodes and waiting till December to watch the rest😂
This is giving off “Queen of Hearts but make it AI” vibes. Exactly what AL1C3: The Wonderland Protocol did.
if usagi gives birth and the baby wins i will actually pull a 'we are not horses, we are humans, and humans are'
i swear if arisu dies.
PLEASE DONT MAKE ME CRY LIKE 100,000 THOUSAND TIMES LIKE IN SEASON 1 AND 2 💔
LET ME IN THE GAMES! The hype is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
So this is past the Mangas story?
They actually put manga games in!!!!
If it's a horrible ending: That's okay, season 2 felt like an ending to the point where I was shocked that season 3 got announced.  If it's a good ending: Cool, we got a 3rd season.
Korea completely plagiarized many Japanese movies, dramas, mangas eg Squid Game copied Liar Game, Kaiji and God's Will. All of us are Dead copied the anime High School of the Dead. Sweet Home's concept was copied from Japanese movie Sweet Home 1989 and hundreds more.
Sooo Netflix ruined this..... Cool :/
Arisu: lan beni bi salın artık
Finally season 3
Is it real that the season will only have 6 episodes?
I have a theory for season 3 is that they are going to introduce a man and his pregnant ex girlfriend and arisu would die for that baby
Chishya Asa Joker I guess Not sure But they know He is trp brw
he better not die istg
2:03 is that arisu😭💔
as if S2 wasn't confusing enough 😢
Without chisiya it won't be the same
way better than squid games
This series is more lit than squid game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The arrows game is from the manga other than that i dont see anything similar to the manga. The arrows game should have been the first game arisu played tho 🤔🤔
DAMMNNNNN!!!!
I needed this!
One of mine best series ever......❤❤❤
When is the release date?
Chishiya?
At 0:41 on the upper right corner, with the help of Google Lens, i read "VEHICLE START": it's the name of the game?
Ann still alive?
OMG!!! So excited for this S3!🤩
Chisiya ...❤❤❤❤❤
This doesn’t count as squidgame season 4 Netflix😭🙏
Where is chishiya???😭😭he is my fav character 😭😭😭
OMG OMG YESSSSS❤ BEST SERIES IS BACK
this masterpiece has the chance to end properly not like the squid games
sana may tagalog dub
THE RELEASE DATE IS MY BIRTHDAY 😭
Am I tripping or they changed Arisu actor ???
Bruh the girl with blue hair already pmo
I HAVE A THEORY A GAME THEORY: the blue hair girl is the joker??
WHYYYY? We did not need it. The season 2 final was good!
Is chishiya not in s3??
Alice borderland :- its time to rock 🔥🔥🔥🔥
guys can any one give a short summary of this show what happend in season 1 and 2 i watched them an year ago i almost forgot every thing
no ones talking about the fact that we have 3 manga canon games in the trailer; the train with the gas that saori first originally played, the ACTUAL first game they played with the fire arrows and the one from RETRY with the escape pods
It looks like Netflix shows have a tendency to nerf the main character's hair in a new season of a show 😂
Cant wait for this‼️
NO. ARISU HAS TO STAYYY. NO BABY NEEDS TO WINNNNN.
Player no 456 is last card 😂
Why cant i see chishiya😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I knew its gonna be about the joker cards as I was expecting it to be in season 2
2:01 nooo arisu will die
Where is chishiya???????🙂
bring back the chishiya 😭
My Kuina😞😞 WHERE IS MY GIRLLLYYY😭😭
Did they take that one game from the anime version? I swear I saw those raining arrows before.
2:00 ... arisu dies
I thought the games weren't real, wasn't the whole thing like purgatory or something? I don't really remember because there were so many fake-out explanations last season I forgot which one was the real explanation
"Knock, Knock, Neo."
YYEYEYEYEYEY i wanted this so much... and they also put the arrow game from the manga (even though it was the first ever game in manga not so later on but still the vibes that they bring it here is insane )!!!
بنازمم
Season 2 ended so well, some things are best left untouched.
istg if this is a netflix cash grab moment 😭😭
1:11 thats the 1st game on manga. nice! so they'll use the games that isn't aired last season
I dont know what the concluding season will offer but AIB is trully a masterpiece.. the games..the emotions..and the connection between Arisu and Usagi..
Omg!!! Im sooo glad they put the very first game in the manga!!! Good Fortune, Bad Fortune
Is it different from the comic?
2:03 NO UR KIDDING NO BRO NO
Like bruh 99 percent of this is squid game comments this is alice in borderland but i dont blame them squid game is better much better
Imagine arisu pulls the we are not horses
i swear if the damn baby is the winner
UHH i am soo exited i love alice in borderland!!
2:03 was that Arisu??
That Joker card staring back at Arisu like: ‘Guess who’s back baby? 💀
BORRRRRIINGGGGG
I can't waittttt
What do you think about the zombie card
lâu quá vậy?
Yohhh they used the flaming arrows that was supposedly the first game in the manga!
Im calling it rn Arisu dies, and they somehow incorporate a baby into the show.
WOW
i dont see nijiro murakami, holy mid
Where is CHISHIYA???
This WILL NOT end up like squid game or I will DIE.
I still find it surreal that Alice In Borderland is back with Season 3 after they conclude it as some ridiculous mass hallucination caused by asteroid impact 😭 but the joker card at very end was always ominous... I just want to see Arisu and Ann together. And also Chishiya. And don't end like Squid Game. 8:58am 1.9.2025
i loveee this!
es como el fortnite creativo
akhirnyaaa s3💗💗💗💞💞
OMG
THIS IS MY SHITTTT
mais uma peak fiction aqui.
The REAL squid games is back
THE GREATEST THING IS GONNA HAPPEN SOON ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
THIS IS GONNA BEEEEEE ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Islamic-ally,  borderland is like Barzakh except in Barzakzh a.k.a, the land of the in between;  there is no more death so imagine when you fail each time youll get beamed from the sky forever .
alright yall showed a lil bit to much in this trailer
We need Yeji in this new season!!!
kheeeee?
Looks like hes gonna die.......
WHERE IS MY BABY CHICHYA? HE BETTER BE THERE OR ISTG—
Oh awesome, they're showing games that were in the manga!
why is kamen rider necrom here
🇯🇵❤
I was better off finishing with the main character's Avengers-style fight. I've never liked fakeouts and metaphors. If very badass thing I watched was all some mind thing, well that screws with me eternally. Im not saying it was a bad ending. I just can....I just can't... ... ..ugh!  Hats off and a bow to the creators nevertheless. I will forever be conflicted.  Wait is this even a real place? I can't I can't I can't!
IM SAT
Where is chishiya?
Episode 1 ends with Chishiya popping out and saying a remark I hope
IF ARISU PULLS A GI-HUN AND LET THE BABY WIN I WILL LOSE IT
Yokosu 🔥🔥
🔥
Chishiyaaa :( where are you
I think Netflix has a big surprise for us, " Chishiya" ❤
Where is my glorious king chishiya and my gorgeous queen kuina😭
I can't believe John Cena is in this trailer!
this is peak!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait
Pointless without Chishiya
Where is chisiyaaaaaa
No one is talking about the flaming arrows and how they decided to add “good fortune, bad fortune” to the show in season 3.
WHERES CHISHIYA AND KUINA😭😭😭
Guys we get it. You don’t want it to end like squid game. Now we can move on and stop comparing it. It’s annoying at this point. You guys aren’t even focusing on the plot anymore because your to busy comparing it to squid game.
If gi hun appears in season 3 he’s cooked
If there's no Chishoya it's not worth watching
I think squid game is overhyped.... Alice in boderland actually better than squid game 🫠
HARUS SERU POKOKNYAAA
woo hoo
ts boutta be so peak 🥺😭🤞
OMG Can't wait
Chishiya?!? Kuina?!?!
where chichya
Sorry, but am I the only person that literally can’t remember shit from season two it’s been that long 😭 I genuinely think I’m gonna have to rewatch
We are tired of useless third seasons.
I don't understand why people comparing this with Squid Game. Squid Game S1 was a Kaiji ripoff, then it got famous as was forced to make season 2 & 3. Season 2 & 3 seems kinda original idea which is why it went downhill.
I’ll wait super movie
bro got a job application 💔
we are cards not humans
OH LETS GO WE BACK WITH THE MANGA GAMES
why only 6 episodes why rush it???
Why is this season looking more like Squid game 😅
Lmao this reminds me of sword art online when Asuna was trapped in ALO and Kirito went in to save her. Am i the only one?
they are trying to be like squid games sooooooo bad.. the last season ended the plot perfectly why add on to it?
I bet on my mama that we gonna see I HAVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE ahh scene
I have immigrated in these lands before, I said I have immigrated in these lands before!
The winner takes it allllllll the loser has to falll trend 😂❤
❤❤
Excited to finally see the raining arrows scene in live-action.
Finallllyyyy
I’m afraid my fav character might die, I need to be mentally prepared for this.
1:03 "YOKOSO, SOUL SOCIETY" - AIZEN 😂
I'm all for Ann😊 Edited: Curious, no og characters?
Is arisu going to die😭😭
Đouma coá ròi hẻ
Missing chishiya and kuina..🥹🥹🥹🥹
i really hope it'll be as great as it's other seasons! i srsly can't wait to see arisu
this aint squid game y'all. this series is way way better than that trash
Did they seriously just spoil his death
Chisiya😢
Japan in Borderland with immigration. Will the japanese allow their country to go to the dogs like UK or will they fight back??!! Tatakae Nipon
I hope it doesn’t clash with my finals
can’t wait
am i wrong or did arisu died in the final scene
An underrated series❤❤
If Arisu and Usagi don’t run off into the sunset together happily married I’ll scream.
I forget his name but the smart 1 isn't in this season?
Go go!
Chishiya....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢
God please one happy ending 😭🙏🏻
What if chisiya be the joker? It would have been interesting
MY GOAT IS BACKKKKK!!!!
hmm i don't think the baby is a "real" baby. might be some kind of illusion, or a dream, anything that the Joker use to deceive Arisu for whatever reason. i don't think they fast forwarded that much to the point that Usagi even got pregnant, you know? pls I think the Joker is a cunning one anyway.
I SWEAR ARISU DON'T DARE TO PULL A 456 MOVE😭😭
Did Arisu and Usagi having a baby 😮
1:38 baby again😑
should have ended season 2
WAIT DID I JUST SEE ARISU DIE DUE TO THE LASER IN THE END?!?!!!!?!
way way way better than Squid Game
They finished 2nd season logically and at the time.. they need more money but time have already passed
WATCH AT 1:42 THERE IS A ZOMBIE SCENE WHICH MEANS A GAME WILL HAVE ZOMBIES OMG
This is way better than Kpopper sheet Squeed games!
WTH was the end!????
ARISU... PLS DON'T PULL A GI-HUN...
"Oh boy look what time is this,   time to ruin a show with perfectly good ending because we running out of ideas to make another show"
I forgot almost everything from the last season
What date it will be featured?
I didnt expect to be this excited, instantly got goosebump clicking this trailer
OH MY FOD NO WAY
Chishiya???? Where are you?
WHY DID THEY GIVE ARISU A SHOWER 😭😭😭
bu varken squid game neymiş
I wonder if both the big and little joker will play a part in the this season. Or will it be just the joker as it says “The Final Card”
After realising the show please dub this show in Hindi ❤
Chishiya Where???
No more homeless arisu 😢
my favorite actor - kento yamazaki
Here's what will happen guys arisu will die to save usagi and usagi will survive and be sad but arisu twill tell to usagi to take care of a baby that they saved so usagi will take care of it
AYE ARISU BETTER NOT PULL A GIHUN MOVE
Anyways guys squid game or alice in boderland
1:38 that baby and 2:05 someone who look like arisu getting eliminated got me into flashbacks of squid game gi hun
Let's pray it doesn't end like squid game
Hindi me upload kar do please
I just hope it doesn’t suck like Umbrella Academy’s last season and Round 6
One of best story moviee
I got chills WHAT  a trailer 🧎‍♀️
1:20 USAGI BETTER NOT PULL A NATASHA ROMANOFF ISTG
How many games will there be??
Weak hero s3 and bloodhounds s2 ❤
Where is chishiya😭😭
Yeah a baby is gonna win this one again
The manga ending, was the same as s2, so is this just a TV adaptation spin off?
Plz Chishiya came back plz 😢
Wow wow wow I am very excited
Where is Kuiana
Chishiya is missing 😢
Explanatory diagrams reduce drop-off in complex sections.
I’m back to subscription to Netflix because of this
UNA? USAGI?
Chishiya??? Kuina??? 😢
Sorry, but this is not the time i can forgive creators for making the side characters more interesting than the main one
netflix you just spoiled the ending
I will genuinely crash out if Arisu dies.
Much awaiting
Gaand faad trailer❤❤😊
This would traumatize me for sure but I'll gladly suffer with you all
0:25 the fact that 2 of hearts game is remaining. Could this be time travel?
Let’s freaking go I think they should make another season but there’s no more cards which is unfortunate
Beeter than squid game
BITCH SHUT UP WHATTTTTT OMG
mimimimi
aura farming
Squid games references 🚫
ANN IS BACK LET'S GOOOO SHE'S THE BEST
五条と一緒に見る🩵
This is better than squid game honestly 🤷🏻‍♂️
DO NOT MAKE THIS INTO SQUID GAME
18
See y’all in September
guys i'm sorry to criticise things a lot before season 3, but ffs this is just nonsense. how the hell should Ann remember about the game? what the hell does it mean that they just go comatose with an injection and start a new game? and why the hell would Usagi get kidnapped in it alone? the games were a collective hallucination because of the fxxkin astroid, wdym now they can choose somehow to come back in Borderland? i'm so scared
Season 2 had such a satisfying ending for me that I wasn't interested in watching more but this does look pretty epic.
The wheel chair dude is somehow surviving the laser game 1:05
WHERE IS OUR CHISHIYA? OUR KUIMA?
CUT THE CAMERAS!!!!  AHHH i'm so glad season 3 is finally coming out TT^TT Everything in this trailer looks so thrilling and ugh i cant wait to binge watch it!
Petition for Alice in Borderland to never end
I am wonder why this trailer not gain so much views  In my opinion it's far better than squid game mind blowing series❤
Bruh i was happy with season 2 ending and then netflix does this🥀
I swear to god, if Arisu or any main characters (Chishiya, Usagi, Kuina, Ann) died, i'm gonna cry in tears nonstop.
i think arisu wont die right? at the beginning the lady told him if hes able to save uhh his wife or i forgot her name, he can comeback to reality i think, and then at the end, he saved her by sacrificing right or idek so that mean he will comeback right, be positive guys🤲🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
please don't split it into parts, that would suck alot!
NO PUEDO ESPERAR MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
0:17 why is Faker in this
I think the date is 10/4 like the watch time is something hide of us did you notice that
Without chishiya  I don't know what to expect more than previous seasons
I swear if they sacrifice themselves for that baby its already been done in squid game😭
where is chishiya?
2:03 !!
i wanna more watching japan netflix series :( i really like this one serie best <3
Nice but it would much better with the old Netflix Design. Please change the Netflix Design!
Usagi might be in a coma or in life and death situation and arisu believe that Usagi will be at the borderland thats why Arisu was put in a Deep Coma to go back in that Place.
At 1:43 is that a zombie?
Ggs
Damn
Why this long????😢😢😂
This show not the same without Chishiya
They better not put baby baby in the games
What is borderland without player like Chishiya 😭🤌🔥...
where is our herooooooo??????
this is lowkey my only will to live rn, waiting for this
Yayayayayay!!!  I was wanting more of this !
Looks like chisiya is not there😭😭
Netflix need to promote this series
HYPE 🔥
Lesss gooooo
Dang much more exciting than Squid Game 3rd season! Can't wait!
Where is chisiya
I just hope that Arisu and Usagi won't die or anything. And can you all stop with the whole "Squid Game thing"??? We get it, a baby won boo hoo... But stop reminding that to everyone in the comments!! Seriously!!!😭
where is nijiro ??? 😭😭
1:42 is that zombie 🤔??
1:36 chained together?
Why is the Baby in it again? 😩
Hope vs Despair? Awfully reminds me of something...
Did arsu  got eliminated?
OMGGG
It's 2025 and my every favorite show end
Oh c'mon another goo goo gaga shyt
omg the temple and the flying arrows are from the manga!!!!!!!
Ain't no way that i was the only one that in the end i saw Arisu and Usagi dying...right?
Looks like the games we’re going to see are: 3 of Clubs (Manga version), a harder version of 2 of Hearts, a museum or hospital game (likely Diamonds or Club), laser tag (likely Spades), a dice game (possible Hearts or Diamonds), and the Joker.
LET HIM COOK 🔥
Where is my blonde hair doctor 😭😭
yokoso watasi no soul society ye
NO WAY ARISU DIES?
Why are people comparing this to Squid Games? This is literally peak compared to that
Yes yes I'm waiting

I don't watch this series without usagi😮
Games that will happen: 2 of hearts 3 of clubs Section B Hurrican TOWER  laser dodge spleef Roll a die Old maid Explosion tartet Chess 7 of spades  Joker Zombie Buckshot roulette

WHERES MY KING CHISHIYA 💔🥀
No chishiyaaa😮😢
They got married, embraced normal life, then Netflix said, Pfft, here’s a Joker card. Back to trauma!
やったああああ！！
i have an insane theory about this warning: i used chat gpt for the summary and im going to write the full version bellow that i had wrote : In Alice in Borderland Season 3, Arisu will travel through multiple timelines or universes trying to find one where he and Usagi can finally destroy the Borderland. The trailer shows Usagi in a crashing train, later on another train with Arisu, and scenes that contradict each other — like her falling from a tower without a rope, then later climbing it successfully — proving events are playing out in different realities. Arisu even sees another version of himself and glimpses a future with his baby, while Banda ominously tells him, “Still, there are infinite possibilities hidden here,” implying Borderland endlessly regenerates in infinite variations. Throughout these universes, Arisu will die repeatedly, learning from each timeline until he reaches the one where he can save Usagi in a critical “two minutes” sequence — and Banda, who chose to remain in the Borderland, will serve as the main villain embodying its will to survive. my version : ive seen the trailer multiple times now and u can see the train that usagi is in it crashes but then in the next scene there is usagi trying to move in on another train where arisu is there but then why did the train crash and why was usagi in that train and how did arisu see his baby? i feel like in this alice in borderland arisu will time travel into multiple universes trying to find a universe where they successfully destroy the borderland with usagi and in these multiple universes he will die a lot like in the end we see him getting shot down with the Lazer and in one scene we see usagi trying to climb a tower but she falls then in another scene we see her successfully on the tower so how tf did she get on the tower when she had fallen from the tower and btw she had a rope attached to her but when she fell she didnt have a rope and the main villain said still, there are infinite possibilities hidden here meaning he is saying there are infinite versions of the borderland where it survives or it doesn't but this season is going to blow everyone's minds and we can confirm this by Arisu seeing another arisu inside the games like wtf. he dies but not quite he dies but in another universe but in somewhere he lives and the real arisu will travel there and successfully finish the games and u know Anne the girl who is the doctor in the white shirt etc she says u have two minutes to save usagi from the border land but these two minutes are going to be huge cause the first two seasons were one minute in the outside world but in the borderland it was years so i think i just predicted the entire season.  Chat is this theory goated or HELL NAW ? 10 k likes ill drop another theory about why they are not into the real world yet they are still inside the borderland but a different version of it created by non other but the JOKER grandmaster. 10k likes for pt2 discussing abt this
2:03 is it arisu?😢
An informative video in a chill and personal way hehe thanks for sharing! Good to know as a guy
Vắt sữa
Where is chishiya
This series should be greatly exaggerated; it's so good. I watch it with my family and recommend it to my friends. Greetings from Türkiye. Happy August 30 Victory Day.
After this Joker season, is it possible for them to create another season? Transition to Tarpt Cards hahahahaha So excited for AIB S3❤
Arisu: we are not cards  we are humans
1:03 Yokoso Watashi no Soul Society ye....
Another season again
"We're not cards...." HECK NO
where fine shyt chisiya
It looks amazing. But we don't need the main character to die just to end the show.  Let's end it with happily ever after!!
Arisu bathed nooo
Murakami Nijiro, who plays the lead character Chisiya, was originally scheduled to play a number of scenes, and filming was scheduled to take place over two or three months, but it was quickly adjusted to be completed in one day.
did he just die at the end
Arisu
where is chisya  ????? @netflix
NCC
Flame arrrows is a game from alicein borderland anime
I see they decided to recreate the games from the first chapters of manga (poisonus train and fire arrows).
arisu’s previous “what’s a shower” look made me forget how hot kento yamazaki actually is
wdym none of my favs are in s3😭😭😭😭
But where is he😢??
I thought its their son met in an accident thats why harisu need to ko back to the borderland.. Excited to this season..
2:03 ARISU?
This school year wont be starting good. (IS THAT ARISU GETTING AN LASER HEAD SHOT!?)
1:45 is he chisiya?
if anyone's wondering iirc chishoya's actor is gonna come back but only for like a short time (cameo)
Where is chisiya 😢

So excited 🔥🔥
Hopefully he don’t pull a gi hun
Best show 😊
AAAAAAAAAAAA
1:08 Is the first game (Three of Clubs) in the manga.  0:23 & 0:44 is similar to the game Shibuki played (In the Manga - Two of Hearts) before she met Arisu, Karube & Chota.
Omg, I thought it would never come out 😆
wheres the baby coming from bro😭 like u spent barely anytime. AND NOW UR PERGNANT INSTANTLY?
I’ve been hearing a lot about this show. 3 seasons is enough to make me want to get invested
FIRST GI HUN DIED!!! NOW ARISU OVER A GODDAMN BABY?!!!
Netflix destroying best series again like sweet home, squid game, etc
He better not be last survivor 😭
wait is all the games are in the dream world?
I havent finished 2nd season yet. I just watched the 6th episode wth is happening
ABSOLUTE CINEMA 🙌🏻
Its far better than squid game..lets hope they end it well
why?
Ohh man….i’m soo excited
Can’t wait
Did they change actors for Arisu?
❤❤❤❤
Due to timezone differences It releases on my birthday, which is September 24th😁
I CAN'T WAIIIIIT😍🤩
Inception + squid games + kaiji
Finally 😃😃
OMG! I can’t wait!!!!
Why do ppl still think banda yaba is Joker 🃏  they were players also.  I feel like banda will make alice  understand  that bc of his status now in borderland he can bring back his dead friends by changing his fate the joker has yet to be seen maybe we'll find out in s4
where is my girl Kuina
Guys chill, When you talk about giving unexpected, the Japanese are just next level🔥🔥🔥
Well, at least Arisu will be able to show his actual potential that was stolen from him in the 2 previous seasons in comparison to the manga.
1% Talking from Trailer 99% are  Talking from squid fame
DA FUQ 2:03 😔💔
GAMES FROM THE MANGA LETS FREAKING GOOOOO 🥳🔥
HOLY SHI* A WHOLE FUCKIN SEASON FOR 1 CARD US GONNA BE EPIC
They took the games that didn’t make it into the series and put it in the third season.the damn flaming arrows-
Seems incomplete without chisiya
So much spoilers!! Why so much trailers😅 one is good enough not 3 or 2 😂😂
What's the point of playing again when you're just going to forget it again.
Relax guys, in the end, they'll again wake up.
Season 2's ending was all fu*ked up! I mean, the main players, they risk their lives to save each other they bonded really well. In the end, they didn't even clearly mention how the game ended. They just gave it a meteor incident and dream!
WTF I thought it was over 😅
YES, I’M SO EXCITED FOR SEASON THREE I’VE BEEN DRAINING ALL MY BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS TRYING TO WAIT
0:00 the intro is js +10000000 aura with banda
WHERE IS CHISHIYA AND KUINA????????  WHAT THE ACTUAL FCK IS HAPPENING WITHOUT THEM??????
is it just me or this actor playing arisu is different from the pt 1 and 2?
Where is Chishiya😢
Jesus Christ died for our sins on the cross so we may have eternal life in Heaven with Him, repent and turn to Him ✝️
Im ready im ready im ready!!!!
If a little baby wins again I'll cried😭😭😭
A sequel noone needed or wanted. The story was a whole thing with a beginning, middle and an epic finale in the 2nd season. Why making up a 3rd one that not only something completely different to the oneshot spinoff but also seems to ignore the lore.
Player 456
No chisiya 😢
2:03 arisu dies?? This better not end like squid game 🫩
if anyone asked, im busy September 25th
We're sooooo back!!!!! 🤭💃🏽💃🏽🎉
1:35 bro is not danganronpa 🙏
Let's be honest we need Chishiya
We are not decks of cards, we are people and people .....
The inclusion of a Korean actor completely ruined this for me. There's no reason for it to happen except for pandering to the Korean market or Kdrama fans.
Ok, the main creator or something of Borderland has been revealed...  BUT WHERE TF IS CHISHIYA AND KUINA😭😭
Storyline, character..everything is better than Squide game.
Where is kuina
im sorry but wheres Chishiya? i know he die at the manga but come on!
Please dub it in Telugu
Hindi ke liye 2 dabay 😅😅
i see first time k _drama It's best drama ❤️🫰
Where is CHISIYA?
1:46 aguni from temu
The joker is a series of games, Remember how Karube and Chota were talking about zombies? Then we see a zombie card in the teaser. What if Karube and Chota were onto something? Arisu will die. There will be more face cards during the joker’s games. During the zombie game who ever dies will be a killer like hide and seek. They will play games from the manga. Kuina and Chishiya will not be in S3, usagi’s father lived and is now in the games. Usagi and Arisu are married. They might re-play 7 of hearts bc we saw in a clip Usagi was wearing the same goggles from the 7 of hearts game. Mira is still alive. Everyone Arisu knew before the borderlands will probably be in the games with his friends (like his brother and dad). In the zombie game Karube and chota’s body might be used for zombies. There will be new characters (obv). The card we see someone holding with a shotgun card might be the games they cleared. Again the bodies of the people who died might be used for zombies in the zombie game.
skip, no Chisiya
Will Usagi become her baby in a very short amount of time as well? 😂
> Squid Games
Don't put a baby infront of me ever again'
KAKU KENTO lets go!
bring back chishiyaaaaa or i wont watch
if i see one more little kid say “wheres chishiya and kuina!” or “were not cards we are humans” i will gen crash tf out like just watch the damn trailer
We are not horses We are people And People are...
WHERE TF IS CHISHIYAAAAA
Am I the only one who noticed they’ve put games from the manga they didn’t put in season 1? Like the game with gas masks or the one with fire arrows.
Yall ik there's that one clip where arisu supposedly dies but I don't think he will lol, I lowk think it's someone (possibly bandai [I cant remember his name 😭]) showing him alternate reality or smth
My man chishiya is not there
AOB is 100x better than Squid games ❤❤
Idgaf imma be sooo pissed if they all just die
Arisu dear , who tf did ur hair😭😭❌
Is there any chnce for chishiya be a jocker🤧🥲i want chishiya in this seriess😭😭
Before watching this I'm asking chatgpt if the ending involves a baby living and Alice or his girl dying. If it's a yes I'm 100% not watching ts
Arisu: "I can do this all day"
1:38 IM SCARED!
wdym , the last scene, arisu will  dieeee??
I think the blue hair lady isn’t actually a game boss but instead a player because if you pause at 1:31 you can see her in that train and not looking happy
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT 2:03 THATS DEFINITELY ARISU
Is this canon? Like does the manga has this story or they just wanna cash out on this IP bcoz squid game got so popular? 🤔
Wow 😳😦😨😯😣😮
Joker ---Banda
I'm most excited for season 3
Plot twist: there is a baby😂
Alice in borderland season 3 is gonna be crazy ' I'm most excited 🔥🗿💀☠
I think I'd just choose death at that point
BRING URUMI BACK!!!!😡
I don't wnaa see another squid game ending 😢
00:56
Who want's to watch in Telugu
Looks like trash
ig it's similar to sao
I thought the manga ends at season 2
I’m gonna crash out Netflix
HOLY PEAK
AAAKHIRNYA YA ALLAH MUNCUL JUGA
Guys not to be that one person but lrly 2:03 that's definitely arisu dying
KAKU KENTO IS IN THISSS???
im actually confused, what "liquid" do you guys think she injected arisu? at the end of the video, he has the same polo shirt and  a clock ticking. I think that "two" minutes is the whole episode of season 3.
Yoooo let’s go been waiting for this
Arisu's first arrival to borderland: 😁 Arisu's second arrival to borderland: 😠
what kind of redcon will be at the begining
did i just see arisu die in the last frame??
LESGOO
Chishiya kaha ha
YALL I NEVER SEEN SEASON 1.    Should I watch itt
Arrow game!!!!!
"We're not humans, We are cards. And cards are .........." 💀
Where are Chishiya an Kuina😭
The best show ever after squid game ofcourse
I'm crashing out if he sacrifices himself for baby and says "We are not cards we are humans,humans are.."
Tamil dub coming date
1% of comments: actually talking about the trailer 99% of comments: Want Chishya in this season
Telugu dubbed
The fact that I can't even really tell if that's really Arisu or not and there's seems to be 2 Arisu too in season 3 😅😅😅😅 But can't wait to see season 3
We are back
We want Chishiya 🗿📈 in Season 3
I wonder that girl with blue hair, her calm and confident face tells that she might be a main character in upcoming season 🌟
I hope Arisu doesn’t end up dead
Arisu is going to die 😐
Why did they even make a season 3. The Joker reveal in S2 was the best ending they could’ve imagined
Why did they shot  arisu in the last  I Can't see this 😭😭😭🔪
Les gooooo
Adieu looking like he touches grass 😭
Ehhh, I'm sorry that such a philosophical end to season 2 was ruined by season 3... And how poetic it was that all the surviving characters earned a second chance at life through their struggle and in the end the most difficult game awaited them - real life, which was personified by the Joker in the final scene.
WHERE IS CHISHIYA
Yes yes yes!!!
Bro arisu got shot at the end bro
Never thought we got season 3 But still, im so happy 🎉🎉🎉
Really sad there aren't chishiya and kuina...
1:42 zombie 🤔💀?
IT CANT END LIKE THIS 😭
Literally waited soong for this series❤❤
Goated show of all times❤❤❤
CAN’T WAIT
OMG It gave me chills
Now this is called absolute cinema
100 milion better than Squid game

Chisiya
Hope the story similar to s1and s2 i mean we all kinda knew whats coming next
There’s gonna be 2 of hearts btw
does the manga have a joker? i dont remeber having a joker arc
People don’t realise what an epic show this is!
Season 2 was such a nice ending, but with this it feels like they are just milking a successful title.
OKAY WTF, DID ARISU JUST DIE IN THE END? HELLO, I DONT WANT TO CRY AGAIN.
Homeless arisu is dead
For 3 long years I dreamt of you I craved you I MISSED YOU
Joker a last card
where is chishiya bro. i really get upset
Hoping the Arisu won't sacrifice himself for someone's child like Squid Game.
OMG..... where is Master card chistsya❤❤❤❤❤❤
What? Its not over? lol
omg Ann is backkk
Chishiya???? 😢
This is better than squid game 😅
1:08 They finally added the arrow scene, I remember the anime adaptation.
who gave my man a shower and a job 💔💔
No Chisiya?
PLEASE JUST LET THEM END UP TOGETHER PLEASE
They unite with that one girl with short hair (i forget her name)
HYPED ASF
"any wound, can become a reason to live"
This didn't need a third season.
That's massive 🔥
BEST TRAILER I’VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME
I have been waiting for this for years! I'm both excited to see the final season, but sad that it's the end.
This better not suck
I don't see kuina, Heya, Aguni and Chishiya but it's okay as long as Anne is there. 😅
OMG IT'S CHISHIYA!!!! 3:22
Wait is chisiya not there in the season ?
Yay Kento Yamazaki.
2:00 . Arisu Pulled A "we are not horses. we are humans. and humans are.."
Alice in the boderland is best season
Found two of hearts in project: borderland

epic ending please
why is there a season 3 when the manga ended at season 2???
i have to rewatch the series tbh!
ate
Another plot wist
omg
Theres season 3?
This is so well written. It's amazing how many off the beaten path things are so good, yet all the mainstream stuff is garbage. Like Hollywood is afraid to innovate.
1:78
Arisu be like : mai ye gandi game pahle khel chuka hoon 😂
Arisu:  everyone listen to me
Even tho season 2 was meh,, im looking forward to the end and hopefully it’s at least decent. Season 1 is so good tho.
I’ll rather die then watching a baby win😂
Where is chishiya???😢😢
"We are not Jokers... we are Kings and queens" CINEMA
Please Don't dissapoint like SG did
Telugu lo release chesi chavadra babu 😢
OMGGGG LETSGOOOOOO
Inception vibe…they have to go to sleep?
It might seem crazy but 1:38 thats arisu's brother holding a baby with usagi. Dont tell mee 😭😭😭😭
they just made a chance for a season 4 to LOL
chishiya
A Baby won squid game so I better not see this too..😭
The show is missing Chisiya and Kuina
Who has d craziest game, squid game or Alice it’s close imo very close
so no one’s gna talk about arisu got lasered? okay?
Omggg season 3 it been like 4 or 5 or 2 or 3 or 1years
Did they change the main lead?
Yet another fictional universe where Yamazaki Kento and Tsuchia Tao are married with kids but it'll never happen in the real universe *cries*
Baby wins and arisu dies, squid game reference and to soon to spoil
KAKU KENTO?!?!
CHISHIYA MY LOVE WHERE ARE YOUUUUU
Pls do not end this like squid game s03
I swear if arisu risks for the baby im fr crashout bro like squid games  💀
2:03 why’s no one talking about this 😂 bro got head shotted
Still no Chishiya💔
" wheres  number 456 at?"
why did they nerf arisu’s hair 💔💔💔
Lets gooo. Nwtflix
That was dooooope ❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
THE GAMES FROM THE MANGA
I really love  this series ❤❤❤
Where is chishiya ??
This series is light years better than Squid Games.
Are we not getting Chishiya and Kuina in season3? 😭
00:59 She reminds me A LOT of the SOLITARY CONFINEMENT GIRL!
00:56 who is this baddie 😍
like this comment to bring chishya
Bring chishya or we are not watching this show thats it !!!
PLEASE NETFLIX, don't give this show an ending like Squid Game 😭
holy shit
If Arisu dies I'd curse AIB.  I didn't watch squid game season3 when I heard the protagonist died, I can't imagine someone suffer so long only to die at the end. 😊
Weren't the games a part of his delusion? Is he in his head again for the 3rd season?
Nice ❤
They need better quality than second season. First season was great. Second season felt rushed and lower quality production.
Im so scared because they made this part out of their mind. The manga ended where season 2 ended.
man where is chishiya
Yo since when did arisu get married?
TS is so tough already BUT I'M SCAREDD
Wait....
This is gonna be one of the most awesome series coming in 2025. W Netflix and director!
Usagi already looks so cool and fire bro.
I swear if Chishiya and Kuina arn't there
after all their injuries they gonna go to Dr. Chishiya to get treated 😂
Will the dubbed version be available on release day?
about time, jeeezus.
Pretty sure this is new content as the Manga ended and season 2 was the end to that story.
First two seasons were perfect. Very excited to see what they did, hope Haro Aso is happy with the result.
So, it's Inception and the Matrix recycled...SMH
At 2:03 it looks like Arisu dies. Imma be pissed if that’s true.
I feel like they showed a lot in the trailer. I mean i think the whole story of this season is revealed that is usagi is back in the borderlands which mean that shes about to die again in real life thats why we see her in a hospital bed ....... then we get to see arisu also going back to the borderlands by taking a somewhat injection that kind of put  him near death for 2 minutes.. he would have this time to save usagi so that they return back to their real world
I noticed, that they bring the first game from original manga to the 3rd season.
Aguni??
Where is my boy Chishiya???
Where is niragi???
0:42 goosebumps
Where is My chisiya 🙃
bro i think chisiya will surprise us
heyecandan elim ayagım titriyorrr bi an önce gelsin yeni sezonnn 😭😭😭😭 bi de chisiya ve kuina cidden yok galiba yaaa 😢
Please no random babies
We’re is chishiya 😔
God's eternal love is Christ's Sacrifice for all of us.  We, as being in the flesh / sin, will have eternal life into spiritual bodies having faith - belief in Jesus Christ we are covered in the flesh and are forgiven by repentance of OUR sins by the Sacrificed lamb of God. Have this claim? Be sure to cling to it these last days. (It is the oil in our lamps). If not, you should consider doing so. By belief - faith we have grace, mercy, peace with God through Jesus Christ and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not ashamed as the love of God is in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. Being in the flesh / sin, Christ sacrificed for us and being justified by his blood we shall be saved from (God's Wrath) and joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that as Sin / Flesh brings us unto death instead grace wins through Jesus Christ righteousness unto eternal life. Confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Our Father God through Christ gives generously eternal life to all who call on him. Wherever you are (HUMILITY) in your Soul claim, ((Christ as your savior)). The Holy Spirit knows your internal seal for the harvesting angels to recognize when Christ returns. (Share This Truth)
Finally!!!🎉
DID ARISU GET SHOT WITH THE LASE AT THE END WTF
Before/after thumbnails communicate value instantly.
IM TAKING THIS AS A SIGN TO FINISH THE BOOKS AND WATCH THE SERIES THX YOUTUBE
Usagi looks like tom boy zero atttaction
So it was just all a dream ☠️
For some reason i have a feeling something crazy is going to happen in that last scene they showed. Looked like something was in the background
raid from bhanu ke papa
Arisu death😮
making shubiki's train game a group game is lowkey ridiculous tbh but i'm really curious to see what they make out of all this
Where is chishiya ?😩
Oh, man. It's been a long time. They are all new characters, right? I barely remember there was the blonde dude and the parkour girl, that's pretty my full recollection. It looks like they got a great budget for this one. I'll definitely watch it.
I can't wait
IS NOT THE FINAL CARD. STOP.
S3 trailer: Drops Squid Game fans in the comments: Panicking AIB fans: Calculating which game we’d die in first.
Theres two jokers in the deck thoooough 😂
If Usagi or Arisu die I die too
Have even forgotten what the first season was like
After how many years  Hope is not another baby winning this
NO WAY ITS BACKK
I was not expecting this!! Omg 😱 This looks 10x bigger and more intense
I don't care what anyone else says this show is better than Squid Games 😤
I guess , Joker is no one else but Arsiu himself.
The story makes no sense but it’s entertaining so imma watch
I get the feeling these will be the best Games ever!
If you haven't completed Squid Game Season 3, don't read the comments. They are full of spoilers.
OMG!!!!!
Theres no All 4 Ace cards on S1 and S2. And also joker. So who's the real Joker?
Absolute cinema
Chichya 😢
😢OMG I'm hella excited
W
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥

Chishya not there ? I'm not watching
So damn excited now. The trailer is just like a WOW.
I guess it's a mixed of Alice in Borderland Retry and Alice in Border Road.  The married Arisu and Usagi - You can see it on "Retry"  And then the part of researchers or should I say people with "special mission". It's on the "Border Road"
Did they hide chisiya?
For a second Train and bridge scene reminds me of ORV lol Overall it was a fire trailer and I can't wait to watch it. I'm gonna miss chishiya tho.
Don't be s*it don't be s*it don't repeat yourself don't repeat yourself
Let's go! 🔥
Arisu be like: we are not horses, we are humans
Does it shifting to us because of tariffs
I didn't watch S2, can someone give the recap and how it differs from the manga? cuz in the manga it ends when they got back, so I suppose I must know the lore from S2 LA before watching this
This trailer is amazing!
Better then squid game
They betrayed us where is chishiya
2:03 IF ARISU DOES THAT I SWEAR TO GOD-
Seems like they're including some games from the other spin off mangas as well
Broooo I'm so ready
I dont care i am not watching if there are no chishya
even if the trailer looks good its still dumb that they made an additional season out of the joker and the fact that they took out some of the games from the manga in the first two seasons ...
There was some new characters, that green hairs girl, looks interesting
The joker's card will be the wildest. Can't wait 😅
Where tf is chisiya?
IVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORRRREEEEEE
Why no niragi I only watch last two seasons bcz of niragi n chishiya
From the way trailer was built, looks like arisu Will sacrifice himself at the end to save usagi
this is cool!! i've never actually seen this show before.
I hope this is gonna be interesting
Still waiting for chisiya
Where is my boy Chishiya ? 😢
Goosebumps😮
Masterpiece
My favorite show
❤
HES EMPLOYED HE HAS A J*B 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
absolute cinema
مسلسل تحفة🎉🎉🎉
God please, don't let this be another "we are humans" ending
Netflix.... IF you made a fking ai baby win the game again.... I aint coming back to you..
0:22 when I saw Ayaka and got reminded of her Sakura Gaskuin days with Babymetal Suzuka, Moa and Yui   it feels nostalgic that they've grown so much and so happy with the career that they've chosen.
2:03 Door label on top means Exit
everyone is upset because they diidnt see chishiya and kuina... you do realize they're awake and in the REAL world. they dont need chishiya and kuina because thats like asking to die with them just for his own benefit... make it make sense before sounding upset
oh this is gonna be insane
SEEING MIYOSHI HAS ME EXCITED!!! I CANT WAIT!!!
Usagi is looking 😍😍
I am worried they will mess up S3 😢😢
you better give me usagi and arisu happy ending got it
Where is chishiya
Who got goosebumps like me, 😎 hit like here
Trailer was well cut unlike 99% of the stuff out here
are we not gonna talk about someone getting eliminated at 2:03
Imagine someone gives birth and the man just Sacrifice himself just so the baby escapes?
Mann... this series looked interesting up until the last scene. I mean what?? Both of them die?? Then who survives?? A baby again?? 😭😭😭😭😭
They better not pull the squid game ending...
THE ARROW ONE WAS IN THE MANGA PART ONE
A survival drama with actual plot twists. It's going to be AWESOME
IF ONE MORE GADAMN BABY WINS IM KILLING ALL DIRECTORS
Bro, did I just see a baby here?
They perfectly end season 2 like how Manga end.   For season 3, the story is not from author of manga. I have bad feeling about it guys....
now this is the real squid games
Chisiya❤
The production!!!
Netflix this is the most unnecessary thing ever season 2 was a perfect ending 💔
YAY
DAMN AND BABY IS HERE TOO
DESPAIR OR HOPE?   WELCOME BACK DANGANRONPA
Arisu looking too employed.
They better die after get shot with a whole mag LOL
looks sick but it's not gonna hit the same. the story already had it's resolution. I'm not even slightly excited to watch this
Pls dont end like squid games😊
Guys, I don't think Arisu will die. I mean, why would they show it in the trailer? There's something to this
please tell me chisiya and kuina will be in season 3
Heck yea baby
I don't think i've ever been more excited for a show.
I NEED KUINA WHERE IS MY BABY?!!!!!!!!!!!!!😢
Netflix really cooked for season 3❤❤, really excited to watch it. Hope there is no baby here and they don't end up giving their life for it 😅
Honestly, to hell with Squid Game and that crap plot. I'm super excited for Alice in Borderland, to me it was always the superior of the two.
SPOILER:  ARISU ELIMINATED
Where is cheesya ?
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS SEASON I JUST HOPE USAGI OR ARISU DOESN'T DIE
Don’t worry everyone....alice in borderland is on another level....not trashy like squid games....soo enjoy🎉
where is chisya
This looks amazing!!! I am so happy as an AIB fan.
ANNNNN
🔥🔥🔥
1:46 BRING IT!!! 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥
chishiya  is missing
Really are you trying to copy squid game by eliminating the hero   Nahhh it won't worth  Please it should be a happy ending 😢
1:12 WAIT ISNT THAT THE FIRST GAME IN THE MANGA/ ANIME?!?  CHAT I KNOW I AM NOT DELUSIONAL
1:03 Alice (Arisu) is finally in Borderland
dudeeee this is insaneeeeeee
Who's dying 😅😂😂
1:06 the maniac behind all this inhumane borderland shit 💀
Waiting 🎉❤
Where is CHISIYA???????
Arisu shouldn't die like gi hun🤞( 27 days to go)😇
1:03 YOKOZO WATASHINO SOUL SOCIETY
nah they're gonna ruin it like they did to squid game and sweet home netflix always mess up with s3
where's chishiya....
1:38 TF THERE'S A BABY.... THERE'S A FRICKIN' BABY—
heck yeah! i thought this series was finished! well done for bringing back something awesome netflix!
Arisu, don't you dare say "I've played these games before," and if Niragi is in this.... Burn him.
Arisu: We are not cards, we are humans..
What about all of us are dead season 2 😢
NO WHERE IS MY CHISHIYA AND KUINA😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
i dont even want this fuckass season 🙂‍↔️
2:03 Arisu dead
What happened to bad posture final boss…
WHERE IS KUINA 🥹🥹🥹
I’d love to see Mira again even though we know what happened 💔. Also could there be a twist about the joker ? We know this series loves its twists
1:45 isnt that chisiya? 🤔
Where can i watch it without paying Netflix ?? Help
No way usagi joins again girl what are you doing
Don’t play with me where the HECK is chishiyah 🤨
Where is chisiyaa
It’s about time let’s go
Lets gooooooo
Where is chishiya?
Where is Kuina and chishiya ??
Fantastic. So much better than pathetic squid game nonsense.
Did I just see arisu die at the end?
is no one talking about the end of the trailer , i swear on my life if thats arisu’s getting hit by the red laser im actually killing myself
Nightmare is back
Chishiya 😮‍💨
YALL ARISU AINT GONNA DIEEEEEEE, I FEEL LIKE THE PART THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HES GONNA GET KILLED, IS A VISION IF U WATCH CLOSELY THE CARD HOLDER IS SHOWING ARISU SOME VISIONS OR SCREEN THE PART HIM AND USAGI IS HOLDING A BABY, AND THE WHITE PLATFORM LOOKS LIKE APART OF IT OR SMTH LIKE THAT OR ANYWAYS...JUST MY THOUGHT!!!
Where are kuina and chishiya😔 i hope netflix is keeping it a surprise
Chishiya??????????
o my gosh…
2:03..???
1:03 Yokoso Watashino Soul Society...
1:10 it's nice that the live-action adapted this one and have it as a game or reference. This was Arisu's first game in the anime instead of the room Dead or Alive room puzzle in S1 (although i did liked the puzzle better).
i wanna see kuina here badlyyyy
Gonna miss Chishiya and Kuina
I’m excited ❤
1 day 1 million views
Where is shishiya
🥵 going to blast🔥
Arisu don't you dare pull another gi hun here 😭😭😭
So this season is loosely based on retry manga but they go hard.
2:03  is dead nooooo😢😢😢😢😢
another baby ughhhh shiballll
YESSSS
everyone complaining about the baby 😭😭
Where.   Is.   Chishiya.
Finally the trailers here
Squid game lasted long enough to become as legendary as game of throne...
If a baby win, imma crash out
CHISHYA????
It is not a k drama anymore it is a baby show now
WHERE IS CHISHIYA
Why are you not accepting my PAYMENT NETFLIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DONT FCK MESS WITH ME WHERE ARE CHISHIYA AND NIRAGI BROOIIOOOOO NOT EVEN KUINA IS THERERE
No, because on a one-sided note, I kind of hope to see Niragi because I would love a redemption arc. It feels like Squid Game season 2, where the new players and the OGS who know it all are brought back into the game. (Which I love regardless of the idea.)   But I’d love to see Niragi be alongside the ones who woke up in the hospital and he’s also brought back in with them them.
Arisu you better end up happily with a COMPLETE FAMILY 🗣️👺
1:43 is this the zombie card?
Where are they huh
The last person being lasered better NOT be Arisu 😭😭😭
OMG YES YES YESSSS A NEW REACTION FOR ME 😭😭😭💕💕
Where's Chishiya man 😅😢😂
1:32 did anyone notice that that looks like the other guy who survived the Jack of Hearts game?
Looks like this turned into the matrix
We're sooooooooooo back!
so much better than squid game
They have the gas mask game from the manga !!  It’s one of my favorite games from the series. I think the positive aspect of the live action is that there are so many amazing unused games from the manga they can still use, as long as they find a storyline to tie them together.
“IM THE HAPPIESY MAN IN THE BORDERLANDS”
1:08 nobody's talking about how the brought in the original first borderlands game from the manga
YESSSS, FINALLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cant wait.... I love this series!!!!!
If hatter comes back I’m gonna cry of happiness
Where is the blond guy
kuina and chishiya 💔💔
Did Arizu just die at 2:03 or am i tripping? 😢
we are not humans we are horses and horses are
Miyyani portlatvorsa kere😂
CANT WAIT 😭
Bring back Kingdom!!!
please be more like season 1 with crazy games and less like season 2 which is kinda boring games
1:10 the first game in the manga i wonder why didnt they do it before
I cannot wait for this to come out
I guess the 3 ♣️ and 2 ♥️ are making an appearance. Was hoping for the 4 ♥️, but I generally have high hopes for the games this season ♥️♠️♦️♣️
OMGOSH NOO IF HE DIES AM DONE
HOLYYYY HEELLLLL
im so so so so excited i want another 30 seasons actually
Why does Arisu look employed this isn’t you baby 💔💔
can,t wait
1:33 DANGANRONPA 😭???
I'm glad they added that raining flaming arrow scene here that they didn't put in the last seasons, that was supposed to happen somewhere in the manga. Althought the S2 was like the real ending of manga, this looks promising.
Where is chishiya😢
This season won’t be following the manga right? This is all new content
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
مسخوها والله ...الجزء الثاني كان بايخ واتوقع هذا الجزء بيكون اخس منه
Omg they’re including the 2 of Hearts game from the manga!!
love seeing arisu get tortured again
Squid game japanese version 🥲
0:55
Didn’t Ann die??? And where is Chishiya and Kuina?😭😭
This most certainly did not need a s3
Omg lm so excited ahhhhh l hope they don’t die tho 😭🫶🏻
Alice Games >>>> Squid Games
this is going to be amazing i can not wait. just got done rewatching season 1 and 2 intime for this been waiting along time. hoping for a way better ending than squid game season 3 that shit pissed me off.
gosh im waiting so much
guys someone pls tell me  dont they wake up in a hospital and that was a dream ? so what is that season gonna be
sep 25 how long it's going to take 😭😭
Looks so fascinating 🤩🔥
Arisu ≠ Gi Hun  Please 🙏
Whoever made this trailer, absolutely killed it! 🤩
IM SO EXCITEDDDD
waiting for it😩💖
Where is chishiya??
Damn, the Squid Games comments are taking over the comment section. 😂
2:12 On my birthday omgggg!!!
This show is so underated❤❤❤📈📈🥵
Squid game on steroids
I think there will be a major charector introduced to us.The girl with blue hair cuz i see here personality is like chishiya and saw her participating in 3 diffrent games so she might be a charector highlighted in season 3
Mat kar lala drop this piece of garbage
L.
no chishiya no party
Arise better not pull a "I've Played These Games Before!!"
oh it's the retry one, where arisu gain his consciousness back about borderland he went through before.
yo, where's Chishiya
Nah no chishiya fr?😢
Where Chishiya 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
OKAY THE TRAILES WAS SOO COOL, BUT WHERE IS MY CHISHIYA?!?!
No Chishya 😢 Well It's Arisu's time so can't complain. He is the protagonist. But please don't let a baby win the game 😅
Wah akhirnya 🎉
Не дай бог он сдохнет
Missing Kuina...
the best survival series and squid game can't even compare 😭 (I love both but Alice is wayyy better)
Arisu...is ...empl*yed
🤯💥
all i want is for both of them to live NETFLIX PLEASE
Woww❤❤❤
Where the fk is Chishiya...??
If the rumors is true about Mina Twice will be actress in this season i will go watch!
There was a season 2?!
The gorgeous Usagi is back ❤❤❤
Hands down , this is better than Squid Games. To be fair squid games season 1 was good but the following season was bad.  But Alice In Borderlands Seasons have been win after win, like literally. I do hope this become a huge big like how Squid Games did cause this deserve ever credit they work hard for.
wait where is chishiya? 😢
1:38 I swear if this baby wins 😤
a whole season just for one card is crazy
Where is my boy Chishiya
Where os chishia ? Favorite character 🥺
It looks like arisu dies at the end of the trailer
Mending ini ketimbang permainan cumi cumi kemarin 😁
No Chishiya this time? Hope he'll be back
season 3 how many jokers?
Hi, why tf is there a season 3???
Alice in Tenetland
Chisya.. I missed him
That will be disappointing like lost. There is no cure for the end of the 2nd season.
letsssgooo
Just don't make a season 4
Hey 🎉 fascinating news and I really enjoyed to watch this series and I am feeling very happy to hear this and I want this to beat the squid game and I am really missing that chishiyas character I have been waiting for this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤I much feel better now 💟💟💕
I feel like Arisu getting lasered is just an illusion as we see also in the trailer Arisu seeing himself and Usagi with their baby so we know it's an illusion
Oh DAMN that looked GOOOOOD, I couldn't even blink through the trailer!!!
ARISU LOOKS EMPLOYED 💔🥀🥀‼️‼️
2:03 is that arisu?????
2:03 did they just spoil the whole ending? so arisu dies in the end?
Is Arisu gonna be Gihun of September? 2:03
2:03 i hope that's not Arisu
Chishiya olmadan tadı olmicak ki
Bu ne lağğğnnn bu neee netflixxx meraktan ölcem 🥲
Good thing the game that isn't in season 1-2 only in the manga are in season 3
IF AIB WILL END UP LIKE SQUID GAME…. NETFLIX COUNT YOUR DAYS
WHERE THE HELL IS MY NIRAGI AMD CHISIYA😭😭😭😭😭
WAIT WAIT THE USAGI WAS NOT THE ONE WHO SHOT IN THE LAST.... SHE WAS NOT THE ONE RIGHT......................RIGHT!!
Everyone is talking about who the joker is but theres two jokers in a deck, theres gonna be two people as the jokers
it is soooo epic omg
𝘗𝘰𝘱𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘯 𝘨𝘶𝘺𝘴 ! ! ! 🔥୧⍤⃝🍿🔥
𝘖 𝘮 𝘢 𝘨 𝘢 𝘢 𝘢 ! ! ! 😱
Lets gooooooooo. I have been waiting for a long time. My precious
We want chishiya
We want chishiya
We want chishiya
My guess is they are living in a death world, they are all dead from the explosion and they are all dead playing these games within the vision of their death world.
we won't watch without xhishiya
i’m glad we’re having another season but i just don’t want arisu to end up like gi-hun. PLEASE.
I swear best series ever. Incredible. My favourite. I’M SOOOO EXCITEDDDDD
Omg 😮😮😮 I can't imagine ... Is this for real !!?   This show is my al time favourite..   I am so so happy , that i am getting multiple ghoosbumps and full of tears😢❤😅😊
Netflix original. What can go wrong.
Ab toh lg rha hai Arisu ki bhi fielding set hai 😭
Can't imagine without chisiya
and the real game is... real life world...
This somehow looks even better than I expected.
เกมดอกไม้ไฟในงานสินะ นี่มันโคตรอลังการงานสร้างเลยนะเนี่ย😊
Okay so I was actually excited for Season 3 considering there's two more great Mangas for it. A little short story that you could expand if you really wanted to but what I expected was for them to adapt Alice on Borderroad next. It's a full length volume just like Borderland and has an entirely new cast, which doesn't spoil any of the lore previously setup. But them just throwing Arisu back into the game is annoying af. I'm sure the season will look great and the games will be fun but in terms of story I could already rip my hair out.
So excited for this to land!
J'ai attendu cette 3eme saison comme s'y j'attendais un enfant 😂😂
No Way!! They're doing the games they skipped f om the manga🎉🎉🎉🎉
Lets goooo
𝗔𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘂, 𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲.
funny how they adapted one of the first games in the manga only now, the one with the "flying  flame arrows"
although my queen kuina probably won’t be in season 3 due to her pregnancy but hey we still have ann right!  I definitely can’t wait to watch this season and meet new characters ❤️‍🔥 Let’s leave the best characters in the best seasons.  NETFLIX PLS DONT RUIN MY FAV SHOW!!!!
Arisu: were not horses, were humans. And humans are.... (last words of arisu)
Chishiya is definitely in the series. Netflix being Netflix is keeping it as a surprise or a cliffhanger  Edit : there's no way they will fumble a fan favorite character by removing him
She showed me this show. We watched it all together. But we no longer speak. I miss her but it looks like I’ll be watching season 3 without her…
Banda🖤🫶
If the baby wins again so I will never see any Netflix series 🥀🥀
what is going on in this show😂
No Chishiya and Kuina, no Alice in Borderland season 3 for me 😭
Where is chichiya  Because chichiya knew about banda 😅
Chishiya ????????😢😢😢😢😢😢
ONLY 976 K VIEWS FOR  A TRAILER . AND YA'LL SAYING THIS CRAP IS BETTER THAN SQUIDGAME 😂😂😂😂😂
Alice in Borderlands ❌ Fielding set land ✅
WHERE IS CHISHIYA AND KUINA I AINT WATCHING BRAAAH
THEY USED THE FIRST GAME FROM IN THE MANGA!! The fire arrows omgggg ♥
🔥🔥
Oh yes not long❤❤❤❤
These aren't even games any more these are straight up natural disasters
If Chisiya could be there 🥺
Is it true that Kuina and Chishiya won't be in season 3??? I'm going to cry if they aren't in it??? ALSO where are the rest of the previous cast? Is this season going to consist only new cast? I am already crying 😭😭😭 Thank God Ann is still here.
Please don't End like squid game I'll lose it
No Chishya or Niragi makes me sad😢
Ye he dies
I thought this was over already in season 2? The manga is short as well and they already excluded a lot in season 1.
I swear if Arisu pulls a Gihun I’m deleting myself
The last sec….
Arisu better make it
anticipating. when will it online
*The winner takes it all and I guess it will be a baby I'm so done if turns out to be true*
Btw I really miss chishya😢
Btw I really miss chishya😢
better than takoyaki game
I’m just now realizing that there are 2 joker cards in a deck
0:33 where it Joker Card?
Frst Wednesday S2 part II NOW THIS MASTERPIECE 🏋️
Great video, really enjoyed it.
no chisiya, no game 😢
Totally goosebumps ☠️
The last card, ❤‍🔥
Disappointing
Arisu please don't pull a Gi-Hun
Let's go!!
ถึง Netflix Thailand เมื่อไหร่มัธยมซอมบี้จะมีภาคต่อคะ? หรือเค้าไม่ทำต่อแล้ว
𝖭𝖮 𝖮𝖭𝖤 𝖢𝖠𝖭 𝖡𝖤𝖠𝖳 𝖠𝖫𝖨𝖢𝖤 𝖨𝖭 𝖡𝖮𝖱𝖣𝖤𝖱𝖫𝖠𝖭𝖣 𝖠𝖲 𝖠 𝖦𝖠𝖬𝖤 𝖲𝖴𝖱𝖵𝖨𝖵𝖠𝖫 𝖲𝖤𝖱𝖨𝖤𝖲 ❤️
Where’s chishiya and kuina 😭😭😭😭
Despair or Hope?  Upupupupupu...
I will not have any expectations this time already dissapointed with squidgame   But i still have hope this show will not focus on maximizing profit but on entertaining audience
Netflix ne arisu ki vi fielding set kar di hai isbaar 💀
I'VE PLAYED THIS GAMES BEFORE!!
Hope it doesn't end up like squid game
Ann better not participate
Yey waiting
Please this is better than squid game, so dont pull a gihun card on its ending
This is crazyy
Don't tell me arisu dies
ISTG IM GONNA FREAKING FLIP IF THEY K WORD ARISU
o nah whatt
Banda is a psycho path
This one in manga too? I can't remember
the final card? sure bro. we all know netflix is going to milk this and create a final final card or a before the final card game. the origins of the final cards
What are they even adapting like what? For the first 2 seasons it was a good adaptation now there just dragging the show
Guys it won’t end the same as Squid Game because Squid Game wasn’t supposed to have 3 seasons and Alice is a manga that’s been being written properly this whole time
Chishiya the best character🗿
OH MY GEEEEEE
These games in S3 are no joke 😭there's no surviving this. Except u're a baby of course 😂
I think baby will win and arisu lose😢😢😢
how many episodes will it be?
Cant wait to be emotionally devastated… again! 🐇🐇🐇
I hope arisu is safe, if he dies then i will uninstall Netflix permanently
Is it supposed to be the last season?
SCREAMING CRYING THROWING UP
A recap video please, I forgot everything!!
BRING IT ON!!!❤❤❤😊😎👌💪🫶😁
Are you guys still not finished...what is even the point of season 3 season 2 was bad enough 💀
What if Arisu sacrifices himself to save Usagi in the end
w
where is my guy chishiya
arisu when remember everything: I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE
Squid Game, who?
fantastic
they better give us a happy ending on this one !!!
The ending of season 2 was perfect for me so if they ruin it I’m gonna get mad.
Where is chrishiya
❤
Damn!!.... where is chishiya????
Where is shishiya?
i swear this shit is ass
Where is chishiya?
1:41 finalgirl...
This looks way more hype than anything Netflix released this year
Noooo chisiya????😭😭
why are all these comments talking about squid games omfg it’s a different show please 😭😭🙏🙏
0:48
can't wait
Oh we are going matrix in this bitch hell yeah
Legends Said that even the Joker card is sacred From Chishiya that is why he isn't in Season 3 .🌚
Alice in Borderlands and Squid Game is like Digimon and Pokemon. AIB and Digimon is so underrated but they are actually better
I better not see a damn baby
where is my goat chishiya
Far more better than overrated squid game
Oh my God, this masterpiece has become a reality series. I advise everyone to watch the anime. It is a masterpiece. I have watched it several times. It makes you understand the events and integrates the scenes into the story.
1:40 does anyone know what car they’re driving based on the interior?
BETTER THAN TRASH SQUID GAME,
Squid game is literally just 10 percent of alice in borderland , no doubt
😂😂
game is look like 2 of heart in manga
where is chisiya
Where tf is chishiya ?
Chishiya and Kuina not being there breaks my heart…
I'm waiting for chishiya,what role he going to do in this and where he is I hope he also in this season  ❤❤🎉
Where is chisiya 🤔
WAIT I'M EXCITED 😭
Is this an original season between the sequel manga with Arisu?  Thought they would have adapted that, or the story with the female protagonists, but this looks uncharted territory.
Damn it I ain't watching! Like why is there no chishiya!
Where's CHISHIYAAAAAA T■T
YESSSSSS THE ARROWSSSS ON FIRE FROM THE FIRST MANGAAAAAAAAAAAA
게이므!  스따또!
Where the hell is chishiya?
If a baby is going to win in the end, fk u netflix fk
Where is silver color hair
no let's just pretend we didn't see that. 🤗
Omg😮
All of us are dead season 2 when????
WHERE TF IS CHISHIYA
This better not leave us traumatized.
YAAYYYYYYYYYYY, IMMA WATCH THIS AFTER MY EXAM FOR SUREEEE
please god I love this show so much, PLEASE DON'T BE HUMAN, please
I just know that blue hair girl is finna pmo 💔
Where is Chisiya 😢
Dude they just showed him dying at the end of the trailer he get lasered.
Arisu 's brother died?
Yes Sir *click remind*
The hell another baby wins in the end, WTF
i am NOT ready for season 3 episode 3💔
1:38 NOO NOT A BABY AGAINNN
Arisu in dead lands
Ok cause where’s king chisuya
He looks so clean and employed it's strange
Squid game 2.0 lowk. And this when squid game just ended? They know what they’re doing.
BEST SHOW ON NETFLIX!
Guys arisu is alive in the manga , he's not gonna pull a gi hun
Arisu। ।  ❤
Don't..... don't give me hope This can't end like squid game
If this story is similar to the final chapters of the manga, and I am happy that my personal theory was correct
I need to stay alive
Wow it is a miracle and non cartoon Japanese show that is popular! There is a God!
This... is... GAS
inception!!!
Wish Chishiya was there😢 but still it seems really exciting
Why make it Season 3? That ruins the best ending from Season 2
I am so exciteddddd for it!!!!!! Cant waitttt and hoping for a happy ending with Arisu and Usagi together❤
So Banda and Yaba are the jokers in this
Oh hey seems like they’re gonna use the 2 of ❤ from the manga ? I mean the shot in the metro with the mask, it’s gotta be that right ?   Maybe they’re gonna use all the games they skipped because they didn’t evolve alice in S1.
2:05 NOOOO This better be an illusion
TWICE MINA
We are milking with this one fellas.
time to rewatch s1 and 2
Can we uave a season 4 to bring bavk all the amazing actors from the first 2 seasons!!
Its giving squidgame and ima lose my visa if so
S02 was good conclusion, why are we getting another Season?  I really love this series but looks to me like we'll take it the Squid games route and just ruin it
in the trailer we got the answer of the last season ending that they are in dream or in virtual reality or aliens in trailer we can see they are seeing all these in dream taking some injection but pls god i dont want the ending of this series like squid game
Best series hone wala hai bhai log
Still getting chills just thinking about Alice in Borderland Season 2 with that ‘King’ card — the card was HUGE hang by the Helicopter and frightening! The background music was so intense and frighteningg, it gave me goosebumps! I absolutely loved it! The King was fierce, fast, and terrifying. I really hope Season 3 has something like that again, or maybe even something better and more intense!
Where is chishimiya
I thought it was a perfect twist and an end for season 2, so why need for a season 3. But now I’m desperate for this season 3 to begin
Arisu ko mar do par, chisuya ko touch bhi kiya to sari duniya jala denge 😤
Excellent movies must watch consultation charges applied
Anyone but not Chishiya😢
No no he gonna say we are not  horses we are main character and main character all ways die after squid game 3
Spoiler alert : Arisu gonna die...its promo releases in korea here
Honestly, I'll not watch this trailer just to enjoy the final season first hand. Thank you Netflix.
if arisu pulls a gi hun the director is cooked (hide 🤗..)
I hope this ends great! This show is better than Squid Games. I couldn't even finish the final season of that show.
GIVE ME KINGDOM SEASON 2 ALREADY NETFLIX
Maybe we can finally see the asteroid in this one
Think I will pass on a season 3. It ended perfectly with season 2s ending. And season 3 isn't part of the manga so this is just a cash grab by netflix.
I hope Arisu won't forget to push the button in the last game
Kab aayega
Where is chishiya ?
ARISU IS FINALLY DADDY MATERIAL!!!!!!!! I cAnt wait !
cant wait
Please end Well!
ANNE!!
This is gonna 9000x better than Squid Games Season 3. I normally wouldn't compare the two dramas but too many people are doing it in the chat so I'll have to follow suit 😢.
Wait did they not wake up from that world
I hope arisu will not say we are not ###### we are ######
Istg if Arisu pulls out a Gihun moment and a baby survives-
Where is chisiya 😭
Wtf where is chiziya
Ann already dead
Where is Chisiya and kuina ????
❤❤❤❤
The *SUPERIOR* squid game IS BACK 💪
where is my beloved aurafarmer chishiya
baby and 222’s girl should be besties 😅
i hope the effects will be better than the blood in 1:00
I think its already over in season 2 😂😂, but i will watch season 3 for sure
1:46 is it Chishiya
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I swear to god if it's going to be another Sweet Home or Squid Game ending I'm gonna have a mental breakdown
Lets go
NOW HOLLON CZ WHERE IS MY CHIYSHA N KUINA ?
That blue hair girl looking fine🔥
I know a lot of people prefer this show over Squid Game. And rightfully so ig, since there’s more tension here. But, I, personally, feel there’s a few plot holes and the show gets extremely ridiculous at certain points. Like, them making that one dude a destructive force of nature, when he was just a guy with a gun!
Netflix really can’t help themselves, huh?! The ending of season 2 was good. But nah! We gotta drag it. Well, they ruined squid game with a second game, money heist with a second heist. Let’s see about this one!
I audibly gasped when I saw this notification, I can't wait for the season 3 !
Was that aguni or is Niragi coming back lol what characters are
do not compare this masterpiece with Squidward game lol.. Back to trailer, whoaaaa so they remember the game???  And ngl never knew we actually will get a third season
Original source material concluded on season 2... so this could very well be a disaster.
where is chishiya
I can't remember a single thing from this show. I need a very very long recap before the new season
Greatest show of all time
did we watch the same show or how is it possible there is another season after s2 ending?!
hello netflix....i dont remember the first two season i watched....it was a very long time ago.
The trailer is amazing ❤❤ so excited for this, hope Arisu and Usagi survive 😢❤
10000000× better than squid games
Give us season 2 of Lockwood and Co
where the fuq is  Chishiya  Kuina Aguni Niragi ?
I want Kuina. Aya Asahina. Back in Alice in borderland season 3.
usagi its dying, and arisu wanna help her in borderline
Did y'all not see him getting lasered at 2:02?
Saving myself the heartache now...Arisu dies saving Usagi. You don't just say "This fate, I accept it" for nothing.
1:00 OH SHES GONNA ANNOY ME SO MUCH I ALREADY KNOW IT
At least Ann is back but everyone is dying guys 💔
THE GAS MASK ONE WAS IN THE MANGA!
I'm so afraid "it" will have a similar ending to... Anyway, it was good to see Ann is back.
YESSS
I hope the Gantz manga will be made into a series like this with the same director
If everyone dies just like in squid game, I WILL lose it
1:39 y’all a baby gonna be winning it again
Looking forward to healing my Squid game s3 disappointment😭😭 We’re rooting for you Arisu and Usagi! 🗣️
Crazy❤
Wait what happened last season im lost i thought they escaped
wtf balatro
The end scene there’s no way that’s Arisu hit by the lazer and usagi bleeding out on the floor
Now this is looking really promising ❤
FINALLY
Yasss
I love that they continued the series after revealing the first two seasons were for people clinging to life and death. This opens the story up a bit into people intentionally inducing comas/near death experience to get back in.
They finally add the flaming arrow game on the original manga.
Guys no chyshiya won't be in season 3 sadly
the arrows from the manga!!!
Arisu: we aren't cards, we're gamers
i was never expecting a new season but im happy.
I don't know what to expect, because this is not based on the manga already
im glad there going back and showing / doing the earlier games from the manga that they didnt show in season 1
I hope it doesn't have a terrible ending like the squid game
Not me frantically tapping the frame by frame key on my keyboard to see where the heck Chishiya is 😭 Edit: read some comments how his actor is battling depression but the trailer for AiB is promoted on the actor’s IMDB page. I just hope he feels better in his own time, though I hope to see my favorite boy in season 3, I want the actor to take time to heal way more than him pushing past his mental limits to be in a Netflix series. I hope he is mentioned or ends up in small parts but I think I’ll love season 3 regardless - looks awesome 👏🏻
"I HAVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE!!!"  -probably Arisu
This looks good wish it was in English I can’t wait to watch it tho 😊
Another intelligent Japanese production.
Omg finally ive been waiting too long for the trailer & i cqnt wait until the 3 season comes out ahhhh so excited bro 🎉😄
I have a feeling that they’re going to get stuck in the borderlands because of something and Chishya, Kuina and Anne enter the borderlands to help save them meaning that they’re going to do that in season 4…
This better not be the final season 🥹🫣
The baby will win
is this from  the manga ?
**Game: start** 0:40
Good Times
2:03 so guys for those who think this guy is not arisu guys you need to accept arisu might die
Nah, second season was a good end
Now there's a baby involved..? This is starting to scare me..
Those comments are so funyy ahahhaha
does arisu die in the end of the trailer
I loved the first two seasons and this one better not disappoint
1:10 the death game from the OVA that released for the manga like 15 years ago!! That's soooo cool it's in the live action now, I'm so hyped up!!!
0:23, is that 2 of hearts? 1:16 What kind of good fortune bad fortune game ahh is that 1:38 I have a stupid feeling this is the final scene, where they've escaped and Arisu is contemplating his life choices of the borderlands whilst his brother holds the baby for the first time
lets pray together arisu doesnt pull gi-hun
Please let the other main characters with cuz they really fit
Thought this series was wrapped up after season 2...and i was fine with season 2 being the last. But im really happy for season 3. I really like this series alot. Let Go!
we cooked
2:03 Wait...what....
Is that Banda who says "Welcome to the Borderland?" Is he going to be the main villain of this season?
I am seeing my upcoming destruction. There is no chisiya and kuina. WTF you want from us..... And Arsiu was killed. If he gets killed at the end, I will pull back the laptop and insert myself into the game just to die.
OMFGGGG
I am so excited for season 3 omg I can't wait
DUDE NOT AGAIN WITH THE BABY
Ooooh snap! Cant wait
bro wait, wasn't it all a gengitsu and now they awake ?
NETFLIX WHERES MY WIFE KUINA
OMG SO EXICTED
Is Alice in borderland basically squid game?
“i think i've seen this film before and i didn't like the ending” ahh trailer
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING
Lemme guess.... The baby wins
Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They're either lonely, they're missing somebody, they're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you don’t feel alone anymore. What really helped me start overcoming the pain and actually move toward my goals was reading Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers, it opened my eyes in ways I didn’t expect. Always remember, don’t be depressed about the past, don’t worry about the future, and just focus on today. ❤
need to share this because it changed everything. was stuck in the same patterns for years - overthinking, self-doubt, feeling blocked. heard about this book Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers in a podcast and the quantum physics approach to manifestation finally made things click. 3 weeks after reading: noticed synchronicities everywhere, opportunities flowing naturally, and my mindset completely shifted. if you're feeling stuck like i was, the frequency alignment method in this book works. still amazed at how different life feels
nice!💫💰
awesome
OMG OMG OMG PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
After many days🎉
everybody talking about squid game better stfu, cuz this show deserves more praise cuz in fact it is just better.
Imagine if one of the games from s3 will be Red light green light😂😂
Where's Chishiya
They could make more seasons with whole new characters and games. I don't want this to end!
Take a shot for every Squid Game related comment you see, recommended if you want to see Gi-hun in person
2:03 NOOOO
One thing about AIB every game is hard asf 😂
Hope for a great season experience 😭🤍✨✨✨
Where is Chisiya??? 😭😭😭😭
FLAMING ARROWS HOLY SHIT
Where is Chisiya?
I've actually been waiting for 4 years!I am an OG fan fr
BRO ARISU BETTER NOT PULL A GI-HUN FRM SQUID GAME S3 </3
i thought i managed to move on from the s1-s2 trauma 😩
CAN'T FKIN WAITTTTTTTT
1:22 Borderland Master?!😮
well.
nooo arisu looks empl*yed🥀💔
cant freaking wait LETS GOOO!
Where is chisiya???
yo they brought some of the extra games in the manga
Watch, days to this release they will have a rate hike to like $39.99 and blame Tariffs?
1:45 chisiya?
zombies and a volcano as a game?? i would be cooked💔💔
It will be a good third season, but I think the ending won't be a happy one...
Excited for this! Waited too long!
No Chishya = no watching
finally🎆🎆🎆🎆
Guys should i start watching this?
Please don't let this be like squid game season 3
PEAK AIB IS BACK
istg if some fuckass baby joins and ruins it imma have a fit
I’m so READY
We are not card🃏 we are... Human.. Human are...
NAUR HE LOOKS CLEAN AND EMPLOYED NOW 😫🙏💔
Kids watch Squid Game ❌ Men love Alice in Borderland ✅
its peak
Damn
Can't wait seriously 😂😂 2:30  from india 😮
I mean the story of the manga is over, IDK why continue, it was a really nice ending and a really good adaptation. I am afraid this season will just turn out to be trash because the big N wants to make more money...
Why... It ended perfectly
I love the show, but Season 2 already had a perfect ending and I just don't care to see it lose it's luster. This loses the point of what made the series special, and that was the mystery behind what the Borderlands were.
Arisu in season 3 🗣️ "We are not cards .... We are humans"
My girl Ann is back!!!!
وين تشيشيا وين كوينا وين نيراغي ؟؟!!؟
I hope they squeeze it out
I hate kids since squid game😭
This season is way more interesting than last season. But But where is Chishiya. I don't like this Nooooo
SEPTEMBER 25 YOU KIDDING ME!?
if they make this shitty like squid games i swear imma end it
WE ARE NOT CARDS, WE ARE HUMANS AND HUMANS ARE
Yes! I’m excited for the third season.
Where is ma boi chishiya
Can't wait 😊
w trailer
How to tell there is bot comments , refer to squid game for free adverts lol :D , this is based on a finished manga that ran from 2010-2016 so yeah squid game is after this! lol, if people really want spoiler it take 1 google search for each character.  Do not look further in these comments
2:03 yall cant let an asian thriller end in happiness
PLEASE no part 1 part 2 bs Netflix!!!
I'm a little afraid of this season, but I'll definitely watch it, but before that I'll have to watch the first two seasons to refresh my memory and feel the same emotions.
Yvette u hear
HOLY SHIT IM SO EXCITED THIS TRAILER GAVE ME CHILLS ALL OVER OMGGGGG I CANT WAIT
Arisu better not dieeee okay if he does lets boycott
Waiting for Arisu and Usage love 💖 chemistry ⚗️
no chisiyaaa????????
1:42 probably zombies
Creí haber visto a TWICE 😞
NO, pls Arisu.
umm what baby r u guys talking abt 😭😭?

Where is chishiya , is he the game master😳
Pls announce telugu dub release date
and chishiya ???????😢
Can't wait, but I need my aura farmer back.
The people who are comparing AIB with Squid game and talking about the ending are the one who watches Squid Game S1 before AIB S1... coz they only watch shows which have promotions heavily...
1:45 chisiya is this season here note this💀🔥.
Bro where is chisiya?
Not sure about s3, guessing gonna be slow and maybe boring, not sure...
despair? hope? danganronpa reference?
1
Why everyone is Thinking it would be another Squid game lol😂
THE REASON TO LIVE A LITTLE LONGER IS TO WATCH THE AIB NEW SEASON I CANT WAIT
First of all when you watch the last episode it had everyone in it but when you watch this it does not show everyone it would be awsome to have everyone that was in it to come back
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Best show 🎉🎉
I have forgotten season 1 and 2😢😢😢
why in the last image like is like he's dead there's no way he's dead we're not having another squid game let this man have his happy ending he deserves it
Crazy
wait omg that girl with blue hair looks badass
1:37 NOT ANOTHER BABY 😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔
AGHHHHH IM SO EXCITED!!!!! But Arisu better not pull a Gi-hun😭😭😭😭
Better than Squid game a million times
At least the train & shrine games that were in the manga are finally getting adapted to the show
ARISUUU! ❤ Finally! ❤
This is about to be peak
DONDE ESTA MI CHINCHILLA WE 💔
Showing the real Three of Clubs game on the live action makes me want to fastforward the time into Sep 25th already <3
they better give a good ending this time
this series desserved more recognition is very underrated, for my opinion is a real masterpiece, and way better than squid game, greetings from Perú 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wonder if it would be as good as prev seasons
I didn't see Shuntaro in this trailer. If he's not a part of the season I'm deeming it as terrible.
please don't be a squid game 2.0 and don't ruin our beloved characters.. 💔
Waiting for English and Hindi subtitles 😑😑
WHY IT HAS SEASON 3?!!!!!!
omg can't believe the trailer is up!! looks phenomenallll i literally can't wait to watch it!
omg ann is alive i missed you come home the kids miss you
The vfx and cgi are next level
Shit looks ten times more exciting
if the season 3 of Alice In Borderland broke us heart i'm never gonna watch another japan series
Are they adopted the theme game of Squid game...?👀
We want Chishiya back ❤
Yeji from Itzy should've been here. Iykyk
OMG let's gooo
where’s chishiya at
if you like this movie let"s go
Petition to bring CHISHIYA back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BRO WHERE TF IS CHISHIYA?! I THOUGHT I WOULD SEE HIM IN THIS TRAILER 😭Also, I think it's pretty clear that Arisu died for Usagi 😭at the end the laser literally shot through arisu's head 👁👄👁
my guess is at 1:37 arisu is watching an alternative future that he could of had but the true outcome he got was him sacrificing himself to save everyone else
2:03 BRO NOT ARISUUUUU
WHERE IS CHISHIYA 😭😭😭😭😭
The banger of netflix series ❤❤
Best series made by humans ever ❤
Arisu don't die for a dumb plot device baby!
Arisu be like: we are not cards, we are humans 😂😂
Another banger from Netflix...
WE LIKE THIS 😋😋
So sad they're about to completely butcher the show for money
We are not players, we are humans, and humans are.. 💥
Without Chisiya or Kuina, I won't watch the series either.
Netflix just casually dropping this after all this time. i need a recap
Underrated masterpiece ❤
Tbh it looks SO boring that I feel like the trailer is enough as a season 3 itself, I was actually really happy that aib wasnt based on two person loving and tryna save each other but now it feels just..like any normal other series
So many games from the manga..love this.
I don't know about ya'll but Im booked 25th.
Cant wait 😍
oh this year is so great in netflix
This is honestly the best series ever !!! This is definitely better than squid game , and by far this is the best series ever released by Japan . This series can actually surpass other international action series/ movies. I can only watch a few notable series / movies and this is by far one of the best action series.
Why couldn’t they just leave it alone and let us wonder and believe they got a happy ending 😔😔😔😔
I'm so excited
Arisu’s new look reminds me of when Roderick from diary of a wimpy kid had a change of actors lol
Squid game ending made me shed tears which is kinda insane😂.......lemme hope this' different
Arinsu dead
Bandaaaaaaa
I'm so excited for this!! Such a good series.
I can't wait to binge watch this in a day
IM GLAD ANN IS BACK BUT KUISHIYAAAAAAA NOOOOOOOO
Where is chisiya
Mano ya na mano arisu ki fielding sett hai
They could've simply adapted the sequel MANGA with a different Alice, instead of pulling a season 3 on their own! Season 2 ended where the original Manga ended! Why do this? Most of the original cast is not here either!
So many people praised this book Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers that I finally had to see for myself. No regrets whatsoever this book genuinely opened my eyes. Manifestation finally makes sense, and the changes Ive experienced are incredible. It deserves all the recommendations its getting!

Here before squid games.
Me half way through the trailer :😊😮😮😊😅😊 Me when I saw the baby:🫥🫡😰
WE WANT CHISHIYA 💔
Wait wut they used that temple scene with fire arrows which should be a part of season 1 in season 3 as per the manga . And some part from the sequel damn
25th September LET'S GOO
Bro I can’t wait
Where's CHISHIYA 😭😭😭
on everyones soul ts gonna be peak 😭😭✌
were isChishya and Quina?!?!?!??
This series is better than Squid Games.
0:22 wasnt Ann supposed to be deaad? so either she is the joker or everyone that died in the games will be alive this season and will participate again or something?
Wow
Not a damn baby again 😭
Frigging masterpiece epic finale is loading...
Why does this look not at all related to the last 2 seasons
Bro wtf is going on
I AM SO SCARED FROM THIS NEW SEASON
IM SO FKINBF EXCITEDDHHDDHDHDHBD
Stop comparing  Alice in Borderlands with Squid Games! Eminem entered the argument: "We are Not Alike"   They are nothing Alike Only an idiot thinks that bc both shows are Asian Series and they play games makes them anything alike bc that's where the similarities end.
Better than Squid Games
if  the baby win like in squid game iam gona leave netflix 🤥🤥🤥.
Where tf is Chishiya!?  He's literally the only Character smart enough to challenge a 🃏
Wait is over 🎊
Then.?  Season 4..???
WHERE İS CHİSHİYA ?????????
STOPP IM SO READYYY
🔥🔥✨🫰
oh this is exciting.  This show is way better than Squid games.  The Manga are great too!
Eagerly waiting but where is chishiya
Where is chishiya 👀
No need to sacrifice yourself for a baby. Just go make another baby. There is nothing special about any baby. They're quite common.
Netflix is trying to make us hate the babies tbh
Chisiya is coming 👀  Dhyan se dekho 1:45
Wait.. isn't that the actor with aespa
Чо Серëзно что-ли а ты не верил
still no signs of my goat…. (Chishiya)
🔥
Arisu finally took a shower
world best web series
Weak hero s3 whenn
can we just simply talk about the show and not compare with squid game?
Pls relase it as a whole and not like relasing in parts bs
I beg please include Chishiya
Banda is the Joker?
that last clip looked like it showed usagi dead and him getting laser to the head I hope thats not how it ends
Infinitely better than squid game, incredible show, the last ep of season 2 has my brain in meltdown
1:09 nah they took "the floor is lava" to another level 😭
It would've been more dope if there was mad hatter type character and he was going to let you in the borderland and just almost dying
WHERE THE HECK IS CHISIYA?
this looks EPIC
I want to see this so bad!
Omg
where’s my baby kuina
BABY?
Better than Squid Game by a mile
It finally came
Waiting for 12 September for demon slayer😭
It is real or fake.😢
Arisu has played these games before and I swear if that baby becomes the winner again I’m gonna have a mental breakdown
Finaly❤
1:38 they better not put that baby in a plot twist
S2 is out ?
OMGGGG
Better than squid game by MILES!
💥💥
Player 456 died  Now arisu died😢
Where is chishiya??😢
It's just me or at the end arisu got shoot by a laser ? And where is kuina niragi and the freind of Hatter (i forgot his name but hé is a cook character) also we NEED CHISIYA (BTW il about his dépression) and happy that Ann is still alive
Chishiya where is you😮😮
MAN WHEN IS THIS COMING OUT GOD DAMN
But why 🙃
Where is chisiya 😢😢
Squid game baby becomes the nightmare of every Arisu fan, lol!!
this better not get the squid game treatment
where is aguni
Insane trailer cut 🥵🥵
Netflix cook 🔥
arisu is so gorgeous oh my days
We're so back
Chisiya??
Squid game baby becomes the most hated one in the internet, lol!!
Im so glad they made banda the main villain this season,his vibe and his whole persona in season 2 was so mysterious,left the viewers engaging in questions,he'll surely be a great antagonist
That squid game baby becomes the threat of every Arisu fan.....
Finally. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhgghhgghghggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹💕❤️‍🩹🥰❤️‍🩹😁😮👍🙏🥹🙏👍😅😅
ts so peak
I'm waiting for chishiya to pop up the trailer  But everyone talking about squid game 😂
omggg bro why all the current shows w games is centered around a pregnant woman at least the hunger games made it the ending not the plot
Alice in Borderland about to blow up the Internet again!!
I got FKIN chillsssssss. CANNOT WAIT TO CRY
its like sword art online
he def dyin
Man did anyone saw the zombie at 1:41
Baby winning again...
yessssssssssss
Arisu better not pull a gi-hun card🥀🥀
No chishiya??? 😢😢😢😢
Did my eyes deceive me or was that a red laser through OUR MAIN CHARACTER?!?!?!!??
We already get quote of the year we are not horses we are humans and humans are so arisu better not end this with another quote Then I am done
2:03 😢
Can't wait
All this talk of Banda, where the heck is Yaba?!
You have your change to surpass Squid Game, and for the love of god, I know you can do better.
Add Queen of Tears tamil dub
This is fire
oh my
Everyone's favourite series is ending this year🫠🫠
where Chishya and Kuina!!!!
Omgg
i cant get over how good that laser game looks its already my favourite cuz HWAT
I freaking love this!!!
We ready!
The good thing about having a new season is that fans have more content and IF season 3 turns out bad we have the excuse to say its not canon since season 2 is technically the canon ending since that's where the manga left off.
It keeps getting bigger and bigger, better and better. I kept giggling when the first season came in each episodes.... finally someone made it right.
2:03 . POV you just watched the whole show end in a trailer
Listen, I love babies I swear, we all do BUT just let them all win, they've been genuinely DYING FOR IT.
Most overrated show ever
I'm super excited
Finally!!
Masterpiece
Amazing!!!
1:38 a baby has been spotted. 🤔
guyss but where's chishiya!????
Where is Chishiya? Why there is not even one frame?
Oh ok so Gi hun sacrificed himself for a baby and now arisu sacrificed himself for usagi whats next steve sacrificing himself for dustin
Finally 🎉
I like AIB more than Squid Games!
Where is chisiya
THIS IS GONNA BE INSANW
مادا حدث لارسو 😳😳
18 hour ,  619k view , lol 🤣🤣🤣 squid game 1 hour , 5m view 🤣🤣😊
This comments section shows how damn popular Squid Game is, even for a video that isn't related to the show 😅
Finally the OG series is back 😭. But its also sad that it's the last season
Internet break
Where is our favourite chishiya 😢❤
Chishiya When??
so Yaba is there as well. understandable since he is also the winner in jack of hearts. but he wasnt shown in teaser then, so glad to know he should have a part in s3
Should have ended at Season 2. Hard to re-produce a satisfying ending like that one
What about the other characters
Chishiya 😢
I hope this show can beat squid game’s dumb ending
Did i see arisu getting hit by a laser ????
Thr trailler is giving goosebumps
It’s awesome how Alice ended up out foxing squid games , LFG!
Where’s chishiya???? Can smn stamp if noticed 😭
Trailer 😱👍🙏
Thank youuu for uploading 😂❤
Arisu 😂😂🎉
nice ❤
BANDA BANDA BANDA BANDA BANDA BANDA BANDA BANDA AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
2:03 na hell nah. im out hell nah
squid game fell off this year. so i hope this show make up for it!
FINALLY A TRAILER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMGGGGG
Telugu dubbed
MY BDAY IS ON 25 SEPTEMBER!! IM GOING TO WATCH THIS IN JOY!
Finally the season 3 is here 😊
bro i can't believe this is happening Arisuuu Why did you have to die brooo the trailer fr gave us spoiler come on man what the FUC-
So the two players who preferred to stay in the game are the villains now? Wow!🔥
See how it doesn't say final season?
That giving goosebumps.
I just finished the season 2 and the season 3 trailer came what a coincidence 😅
I knew that guy had something to do behind the scenes, and I was right(I'm talking about that short hair guy). Bring it on. I'm so ready. I was thinking whoever wrote this how they even come up with all of this it's so good and unique 😭😭. Can not wait, tho seriously will miss out mastermind Chishiya but still have to watch 😭
This looks so brilliant and complex ❤
Chisiya????? If not chisiya then wth is this season about? He single handedly was carrying the series.
That last scene better not be what I think it is
Missing chisiya 🥲
The ending is about playing 9 of hearts game. When arisu wake up he find that usagi has a baby child born.
This reminds me of "Inception"
SO IS THAT THE JOKER😮...
😊Best Of luck 🤞 Usagi and Arisu ❤️👍
where is chisiya if chisiya is dead then and no sense to watch
This is going on the same track  i think in the end the hero will die (the story completed in season 2 ) did we really need it : No
2:03 what the heck was that bruh😭😭😭😭 is he dying or what
「二階堂さんへ あなたが演じたチシヤは本当に素晴らしくて、『今際の国のアリス』に命を吹き込んでくれました。ファンとして心から感謝しています。今は大変な時期かもしれませんが、何よりも大切なのはあなたの健康と幸せです。ゆっくり休んで、自分を大切にしてください。 それでも、もし可能であればシーズン3でまたチシヤとして戻ってきてほしいと願っています。あなたの存在は私たちにとって大きな力です。ずっと応援しています。❤✨」
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG I THOUGHT ANOTHER SEASON WOULDNT COME WOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I am eagerly waiting for this session
where is chishiya
THIS IS GONNA BE SO HYPEEEEE
Season 2 had the perfect ending...whyyyy
Arisu is em*loyed now🥀🥀
Oh man
ñÑñ.
better cinematography and thriller
I expect some zombies in this season although the trailer looks awesome
ate
I have no problem with arisu dying. I just want entertainment and I want to explore the director's creativity
Still cant believe they are giving us the original three of clubs, on a non canon story xD
0:00 it’s all over my screen
Alice in borderland I have so much FAITH in you give me a REAL ENDING 😭
where is chisiya my shylaaa
Wow im so excited 😊 love from India ❤❤❤
I think arisu will do the same like gi hun
0:17 I love you joker ❤
Can't wait to see arisu's "I've played these game before" moment😛😛
Who gave him a bath?💔
Finally ❤❤❤
The name Arisu is so close to my friend who's recently passed. I feel like she would have watched this show, but I'll never get to ask her.
Ohh what the heckk !!
I wanted to see chishiya in this part but they foreget him 😢
The games looks so much more deadlier it's insane. the serial killer's game might be the most difficult.. Let's go Arisu and Usagi. I want them survive so bad!! i think we all have PTSD from another show...
Its here
dont play with me rn
Sunato Banda the Bandersnatch in Borderland was still in a Coma  😂
1:06 ISNT THAT THE GUY FROM THE MAFIA GAME IN S2 ?? I THOUGHT HE DIED
This releasees a day before my birthday
One of the best series 🤞🏻 After five years back ❤️....
This is f**king crazy
WTF 2:03 Again Disheartened 😢
I’m literally going frame by frame to be delusional that this using the Ending
2:03 so Arisu dies?😮
Yes 🎉🎉
The Squid Game ending that never was !!!
Arisu:The cards are humans too
No chishya?
Chahiye
If arisu pulls a gi-hun im crashing out
Absolute Cinema
Man, u ppl are obsessed with squid games 😂😂
Season 2's ending was perfect so I didn't want a third season but this actually looks epic
Games look more dangerous than previous seasons!!😮
Arise better not pull a “we are not cards we are humans…humans are”
FINALLY!
So are they dying and stuck in limbo again or something?
WHERE İS NİJİRŌ MURAKAMİ!
Season 2 had the perfect ending for me and I always told myself to watch another season as an extra (so if it goes downhill we still have our grand s2 finale). But I am always so excited for more of this show as I love this universe, it's so intriguing and so full of mysteries. This trailer looks insane! I didn't even know I was gonna be so excited for this season but bring it on already!
КУДАААА. Я ЕЩЕ 2 СЕЗОН НЕ ДОСМОТРЕЛ
รอก่อนพึ่งกูภาค1
He’s gonna pull the horse card I know it
Arisu wont make it into the real world again 🙏
The train with the gasmask scene looks like the 2 of hearts game from the manga played by the lady they were with at the start before they got to the borderland. Looking forward to this!
Unwatchable without chishiya 👎
come on its baby  1 human 0, need to catch up
Wooo
The goat series is back bro
No chysia then flop for sure
Friendship in this show = who’s dying first
My queen USAGI 😭 I swear if ARISU dies I'm pulling my own card
Nooo where’s the boy with the blonde hair
I think arisu will be die😢😢
"What the heck, how do we even survive that?" My honest reaction if I ever cross into the borderlands
So much already happened in ONE minute... Now imagine just how much can happen in TWO ??! 😭
Chishiya pspsppss please come back
Better than squid game............
IM SCARED 💔🫩
I need chishya, kuina and mabey rven niragi bro where are theyyyy
Stop doing this...  My heart can't take it!!!
Sorry but mabey this is even better then squid game

i dont understand anything BUT I AM HYPED ARISU USAGI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:04 nah nah nah you can't pull this squid game move hell nah 😭🙏🏻
Zombies 😮😮😮
Where is chisiya??
I have a theory. WHAT IF the zombie is Chota? Yep a lot will not believe me but its probably Chota idgaf if he died on the meteor scene. I think Chota is the zombie me and my friend think that its Chota...
2:03 Netflix I can't watch this scene.😭
Chisiya😭😭😭
I liked how it ended with Season 2.
best
I’m gonna miss the other characters but I’m also here to enjoy and stress over insane games again
I THOUGHT NIJIRO WAS CURED WHERE IS HE😭😭😭
Cant waitt🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chisiya ke fan like ❤
I am so excited 💗 How should I wait until 25 September 😭
Omgad

Dude I cant wait for this to come out. I loved seasons 1 and 2. Kept me on the edge of my seat
No chisiya no watch.. sorry
I'll unalive myself if usagi pulls 222
Diziyi izlemeyeyi cok istiyorum ama ikinci bölümden sonra dayanamadım kana 3 sezon boyu hep boyle mi
Inception concept?
Plz don't pull a Gi-Hun Arisu. Jokes aside this season looks peak asf
ngl looks cool and all but where is ma boy chishiya at ??
The third season doesn't follow the manga so the season is unpredictable... arisu better not pull gihun card and sacrifice himself!!
1:42  I see the zombie in 2♥️ game
Chistiya carried 2nd season, amazing. Hope to see him in alice in botherland season 3. Only one, who knows about this joker  in jack of hearts
WHERE'S NIJIRO ( chishiya)
Where is chishiya ???😢
Well,  there goes another main character dying, or will they really die? **Vsauce music**  Edit: That was a possible future from the final game
Ahhh! Im not free anymore bitches !
I am not mentally and emotionally ready for this yet!😮😢
alright....... but where is chishiya
can not wait!
Did I just see a baby? 1:38 Arisu pls don't end up like player 456
In this series Only 1 % people see Zombie🧐
Hopefully Arisu doesn't pull a Gi-hun and sacrifice his life for a baby
1:03 watashi no soul society
1:18 wow. This game looks exactly like the minotaur labyrinth game from the manga "Usogui". The way the rooms are set up and the naming od the rooms are exactly like in Usogui.
Squid game  no.456 dead Alice in boderland arisu dead😢
Finally finally finally finally  Finally the wait is over
Got the goosebumps everytime
Absolute cinema ✋🥶🤚
banda is the joker 🔥🔥🔥🔥
There are two games from the manga, the game with arrows and the game in train
I am waiting
It looks good but after Squid Game, I worry.

Jeez
I'm glad this one is not following the manga spinoff.
Noo arisu not like GI HUNNNNNNNN
Spoiler alert. A baby win the game.

I feel like the Lazer through the head at the end was a trick cus they wouldn't show us that..
Where is kuina ans chishiaaaaaaa

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh 🫨🫨🫨🫨

WE YES WE are finishing this in one day
Damn, I didn't even recognize the dude that plays Arisu anymore. Mf done grown up lol

Yipee
Wtf where is chisiya
Excited
Where's chisiya
Are they messing it up like other shows? 😮
Finally wait is over 😌
Been waiting too long for this
Bro where's chichiya
Arisu : We are not Cards 🃏 We are Humans
Definitely something to look forward. Hope it turns out better than the recent Squid Game which is a disappointment 😔😔😔
Chishiya will be missed !!
ARISU kemana min?
99% of comments: hoping Arisu doesn't pull a gi-hun
who the hell is going to survive all tht? the avengers?
where is CHishiya
ANN ❤❤
楽しみ〜
But what about bay chisiya
But what about bay chisiya
If Arisu pulls a Gi-hun you guys will not be hearing from me again.
PİŞMANİYE SAÇLIM NERDE
Biggest money grab ever
Netflix canceling The Waterfront is dumb. Probably the best show on Netflix this year.
Arisu ❤️ Usagi
I love how 99% of the comments are just memes and references to Squid Game
Where is chishya😢😢😢
Stop putting squid game reference here
Oh hell nah where is chishiya
Imma throw my hands where is my chishiya😭😭
Finally the Good Fortune, Bad Fortune is Here 🏹🔥⛩️( 3 of ♣️ ) This is gonna be an Absolute Cinema ✋🃏🤚
NOOO WAY
1:03 YOKOSO
IF ARISU DIES TO A BABY IMMA LOSE IT😔✌️
Guys, come on, be positive! My theory is that neither Arisu nor Usagi are going to die. The teaser and trailer casually show Arisu getting struck by the laser at the end, but they’re the main characters — there’s no way they’d reveal such a huge plot twist in a trailer. I think it’s more likely to be a dream, illusion, or some kind of manipulation within the game. Remember how in Season 2’s ending, Mira tricked and manipulated them three times, making us believe it was real? I really hope both of them don’t die, because I honestly couldn’t handle it if they pulled a move like killing off the main characters 🙂and I also wish they’d make a Season 4, because this series is so underrated and deserves way more love
I have big expectations please don't mess up
Why would they spoil arisu's death
Bro stawp saying the ending it wont be loke Squid game AIB will be gud
1:05 to my soul society.
why's this comment sound like in instagram bro😭😭
THE BEST SERIES IN THE UNIVERSE  OHH I MEAN MULTIVERSE.  ALICE IN BORDERLAND SEASON 3
Err... Is there really a gamemaster or it's just me?
Where is Chishiya😭
if you left it incomplete this season 🙂 i will come looking for you netflix. i will haunt you in your dreams
Everyone Joking About AIB Getting A Squid Game Ending. I'd Say Its Possible Considering this is the same show that had the main villiain body the entire cast yet not One of them died because they had the power of Friendship. 😂
i want Niragi
better than Squid Game
Chishiyaaaaaa Kuniaaaaaa 😩😩 Where are youuuu😟
USAGI BETTER NOT DIEEE
we need anime adaptation! a 1:1 anime adaption that follows the source material!
Arisu....don't die please please please 🥺🥺🥺
OMG Ann is back😍😍
Wow
Where is chishiya...😢 I want him
FINALLLYYYYY WE ARE SO BACK
Can't wait for this to release
My prayers have been answered
We are not cards  We are humans and Humans are
I actually cannot stand how excited I am for this (also why is everyone talking about squid game this is ALICE IN BORDERLANDDDD ITS MORE IMPORTANT RN ALSO THESE SHOWS ARENT EVEN CONNECTED BROOOO)
Gihuns ending was thematically appropriate and tragic cry about it
Alice in borderland is far better than the squid game. Like 100× better
Arisu will die at the end😢
so many ultra low IQ clowns in the comments😀
If they die then please don't let me watch it, season 2 had a perfect ending, you don't have to pull out squid game move to every beautiful series please please
Another best season incoming
I'm so glad they include the first game from the manga that flaming arrows is so epic, can't wait 🙌🔥
Where is chishiya
Still it's going to be a dream in the end lame ending in season 1 also in 2 too🥱
Okay where the f...is Chishiya and Niragi and Aguni.... 😭??? Don't say they are aren't there 😱🫩 Don't get me wrong I'm still excited but...😒
🔥🔥🔥
without chishiya i will not watch this
LAN DÔRİ NERDE
Did they just spoil the joker to us
I loved their hard work, but this show wouldn’t be same as before because chishiya and kuina are not here😢
1:07 wait is this the first game arisu played in the anime?
bu yil sinavi var diye izleyemeyenler  ⬇️
THIS IS INSANE WTF
I was always pretty sceptical of there being a season 3 since they wrapped up the story almost completely apart from the foot in the door that was the “joker card”, that to me, felt pretty forced and like they wanted to milk the show. I feel like they should market this as a spin off instead of a season 3. I know there’s a separate mini story in the manga, but they titled it Alice in Borderland Retry because the main story way over, it’s the same here. It being a season 3 just feels off to me, especially because the main thing most of us liked about the show was that it was an ensemble show and now most of the characters we fell in love with are gone
I think ann is on a coma and still inside that world
so banda's the joker
i LOVE the nod at the first game in the manga! So cool they decided to reference it
Why no one talks about where is master Chishiya?
If there has baby I really lose it . I don't wanna a baby who will wins .😢😢
Didn't wanted it to be a love story.. 😢 Where are the other important characters?
Finally.. the arrow game.. 😂
The more you think about something the more likely it is to happen.........so guys please stop😭😭
What the heck with this trailer... Goosebumps 📈
Where is chishya😢😢
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
They spoiled everything 🥀💔 ann is alive arisu usagi having baby. Tf usagi in danger 🥀💔
no chishiya?
2 minutes? why so focus on 2 minutes
It's real???
Now it is coming 😍
No Chishiya and Kuina, hell no 😭
Miss ....😢Chishya
If a baby wins again I'm gonna lose my shit
I promise you if the baby wins
Damn
Where is chisiya
No chistiya no Alice in borderland
I have crossed the broder 😊
but we want chashiaya
who was waiting for season 3 just to see chishaya?!
Shutaaaa angassss
Arisu took a shower, went to the hairdresser and got married. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
looks like SAO?
If arisu dies i swear i will never forgive netflix
Doesnt matter if there are too many adds, cos Ill be cancelling all together. Remember paying to not have adds, now we pay and get adds anyway, lol, how about 'no'
If the ending is the same as manga and netflix does't screw it up, I'm definitely gonna watch it!
I love arisu❤
The ending of season 2 looked like a good wrap up. This trailer doesn't convince me that this new season isn't a forced sequel.
Waitingggggggg❤
Arisu better not pull a gì hun😭😭
cant waittt
Don't die arisuu plsss lng
Everyone talking about squid game here  HELp ,!!!
No chishiyaaaaa
If this is just like Squid game with the twisted storyline. I am definitely in🎉  Edited: What has this show become?!? Omg... 🤢🤬
Best Birthday  Gift Ever❤
Where is chishiya??😢😢
I‘m so ready🫰❤️‍🔥
NETFLIX I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT IF YOU PULL A SQUID GAME HERE
WHERE CHISHIYA
one show with a great ending that did not need a third season
USAGI BETTER NOT DIEE
Just random thoughts:   AOT manga/anime's ending talks about how sometimes we need to think beyond our love for the good of the world.  Alice in Borderland MANGA talks about the mind's tendency to cope.  Let's see how the live action adaptation is going to end.
1:42 Did I just see a zombie???
Alice in wonderland 🥰💕 Alice in borderland 💀☠️
Where are Chishiya and KuinaWhere are Chishiya and KuinaWhere are Chishiya and Kuina
Chishiya either wont play or he will have some badass entry
Plss not turn it up as squid game s3😂
Been waiting for this for so long
I hope arisu is not dying because when a baby wins again im lost
They trully bout to ruin this show too, huh?
Chishiyaaaajajsjzmznxjsjdjsjsj
I can't waitttt
Arisu you better don't die
I want chishiya where is he?????
How do the directors and writers come up with such creativity 😭😭
don't make this kind of end , i will leave netflix for sure
Netflix is on banger this year
People who have read manga
Oh no, Arisu don't pull a "we are not horses we are humans" ah move
Omg just omg
It really looks like he's gonna pull that,"we are not cards,we are humans and humans are.."card
Whyyyyyy??? Why not using the Mangastory?
I like how they are bringing games that were only seen on the manga
Finally
was that arisu that got hit by the laser at the end like wtf
Why do they always nerf the mc’s hair
why is arisu employed
YO IM SOOO EXCITED!!!!!
Where is  Goat chishiya..?
is this still based on the manga series? i dont recall any of these events happening.... (its been a few years since i read the manga)
1:15 Shuntaru Chishiya ???
Wherese my man(chishaya)😭
OMG THIS ONE MANGA SHIBUKI GAME!!
Arisu better not pull a we are not cards ♦️ we are humans
0:52 he sounds like Kuzuryu tho 0:58 she sounds like Urumi 🤔  We don’t see Kuina and Chishiya, so that means they won’t be able to see each other again…  1:01 he looks like Aguni 😦 1:05 i dead[###] though he was Kuzuryu but no, i was so happy that i thought my king got revived. 💔💔💔 2:03 my theory is that both Arisu and Usagi dies, because that girl look like Usagi herself and Arisu dressed like he’s employed, OR, maybe it was Arisu’s brother that tried to help. I think  AIB is amazing ❤️‍🩹🔥  Also i love how Banda is a game host and Yaba is his partner like Mira and Kuzuryu now ❤️❤️❤️
If Arisu died I m done with this series
I see a lot of familiar actress in S3. In S1 and S2 I only know Yamaken, Tsuchiya Tao, Nijiro Murakami, Yamapi, and Tsunematsu Yuri.
If arisu died like gi Hun I’ll cancel Netflix
🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍
My honest reaction "Arisu to giyoooo"😂
ARISU PLSSS IM BEGGING DONT DIEEE
OK BUT THE ZOMBIE😭
1:42 THERES ACTUALY A ZOMBIE
ARISU NOOO
Where is the funking Chistiyaa
Don't let the f**king baby won 😾🫵🏼
Oh my God Squid Game is Over
Where is chisiya
WHERE IS KUINA AND CHISHIYA.
Where’s Chishiya!!!!!?
where is chishya?
omg ik either usagi or arisu isnt gonna make it (im crying wheres kuina)
Where is chisiya where he.? 😢
This is Peak 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
what the f*ck where is Chishiya
The baby is win again
MARRIED, SHOWERED AND EMPLOYED??? THATS NOT MY ARISU 💔🥀
1:03 is that Aizen reference of "welcome, to my soul society".
0:39
waiting of this season 03
Im not watching it if there is no chishiya
I want chishiya😭
that blue-haired girl looks cool, i hope she survives
if he does "I HAVE PLAYED ALL THIS GAMES" move, trust me i will crash out so hard
So this is what aib without chishiya looks like —> sh*t
Игра в кальмара даже рядом даде рядом не стоит по сравнению с этими играми
Where are Chishiya and Kuina ??????
Awesome! But Where are Chishiya ?
Chishiya???
CHISHYA MY GOAT WHERE ARE YOU
Chishiya kaha hai bkL🤬
season 1 i good but season 2 was worst
where is the white hair man ???
Within a span of two minutes nah bro 😭
Dear Netflix, it is request, we don't want a Gihun 2.0.
Where is our GOAT chishiya
1:00 the blood looks so png and unrealistic
WHAT THE HELLYYY
They better get Chishiya Man or else ain't watching this if a Baby wins again 🙏
Oh my, I love this. ❤❤❤
September on fire 🔥
Arisuuu ki fielding set hai bhai😮
Why is there a baby here? I don't want the squid games 0.2
Green light, red light 🚨
2:01 IS THAT ARISU WHO GETS TRUCK BY THE LASER IF IT IS I SWEAR BRO NOOOOOOO
Chishiya❤
Arisu: I've played this games before!
Arisu will sacrifice himself just to save someone's baby 🍼
Let’s gooooooooo
it seems even arisu get his job in series , where as i am still in home enjoying in fathers money
Netflix ne sab ki fielding set ki hai is saal😢
I feel like it's been so long that i have to rewatch the show before this season  😅
imagine half of this is just them being in a simulation rather than borderland
"Still, there are infinite possibilities hidden here." That line makes me VERY exciting about the new season. It seems like they are going to talk about parallel universes a lot. I CAN'T WAIT!!
Arisu Eminated 😭
Amazing 😍 it's become crazy ☠️
I am waiting for your release 😢😢
This trailer proves that AIB > Squid game
Chisiya is alive or not
Nie mogę się doczekać 😎
Arisu look tottaly change 😢
it's crazy nobody talked about how ann and arisu remember/knows about the borderlands
Where is Chishiya 😢
Can't wait for this...!! 🤩✌🏻
OMG
all i could say this might end in a controverisla ending its not just arius dying but i think within it a alternate reality thats shows us a happy ending and thats my theory i dont know if its gonna happen but ill look this back somehow
2:04 ohhhh wow! This look Epic 🤩 🔥 I'm so excittteed my favorite Netflix show ♦️♠️
Where is cichsiya
Where is chishiya . If he is not leading iam not gonna watch it😢
almost all original storyline.  Hisoka will be interested in joining the game
❤
Chishia is the Joker 🃏😁
Chishiya chaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn wheree are youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Where is that chill guy? 😭
I'm so excited only on 25 September 😊
Can someone explain it to me, wasn't the story already over, where all the games were just a test when they experienced death in the real world?
Arisi Die by Laser in ending. Wow.
Where is Chishiya???
❤❤❤
Where is my boy Chishiya?! 😭
Where is chisiya , I am searching for him😢😢😢😢
S2 was perfect, 3 has to top it
Where tf is chisiya
All of us are dead ka session 2 bhi la do Netflix walo❤
Hindi
😭 chishiya will not be there
NO CHISHIYA. WHAT THE HELL NETFLIX
are we gonna spend a whole season for just one more card?
why did i got scared listening yokoso
Even this teaser is far better than whole squid game.
Who is joker gonna be interesting
Where is bloody chisiya 😢
We humans are
HHHHHHHHHHAHHAHAHAHAHAH I'M SO SO SO EXCITED!
Does anyone know if Nijirō (Chishiya) will be in the 3rd season? I heard people saying that the actor was depressed or something but then someone else says he’s going to return. I hope he does!!
despair or hope? Wow maybe a danganronpa kind of thing happens lol
Why everyone compare it to squid game i bet its better and pls dont die on me chishiya 😭
❤❤
Where is chishiya????
Chishiya???
Too excited for this season at the same time fearing about the deathly game our fav cast will be facing I hope they will survive!!!!
damn!!!!!!!!!!!!! its beyond my expectation
The raining arrow is here 😮😮😮
Waiting for all of us are dead 2 💎🥵🙏
Every female AI announcer voice in these is the same I swear
WE WANT CHISHYA BACK !!!!!!
No Chishiya, Niragi, Kuina, Aguni?
The Joker plays begin 😁😁😁😁💀🤡
so my take on this season is: Im watching the end first. If it is not happy ending in my eyes (Arisu and Usagi alive), the 3rd season did not happen in my universe 🙂. i like ending of season 2 so im more than happy to ignore the 3rd season if need be
I'M SO READYYYYY TO WATCHHHHHH
where is chishiyaaa ??
arisu will sacrifize himself for a cgi baby✌️🥀
Bang🎇
Imagine all former players like Chishiya, Anne, Kuyina go back to the borderlands to help Arisu and Usagi
▪
Our last trip to the borderland has come😀
SEATED
! ARISU will die ! you hear it
bro i was watching the whole trailer waiting for chishiya but not even a glance😭
Peak fiction
please where is niragi 😭
I'm so so so much excited for my favourite show 😭❤️❤️❤️ this looks dope 👌
I will say it again this serie is underrated and it's much better than Squid Game
1:04 WATASHINO SOUL' SOCIETY
Ohh that's why the train is not shown in season 1 because they put it in season 3
omg september na omg i cant wait i crying.
Language Telugu 📈 100% 😏
The thing is, Season 2 had imho a perfect ending. Idk if a Season 3 is even necessary because apparently the manga's ending was Season 2's.
Netflix in 2025 : 🥳🎉 🔥
DAMMM THAT GIVE ME GOOSEBUMPS
This show has everything in it , I bet everything . Couldn't be much more excited
Where is chisiya
Last 1 min editing 🔥
I will predict the Game with the Train is a two of hearts Game and the game with the flaming arrows is called Goodf Fortune, Bad Fortune
I think Arusi won't die. It was Banda who got lasered.
EASY GAME
wth did he die????????????!
" This fate i accept it "
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
i clicked so fast when i saw the noti omfg!!!
Shishiya😢 ??
Fk u mean arisu gonna pull a "we r human" card bruh HELL NAH
Chisiya?
Netflix is giving us series after series.
This season is very exciting. I have never watched it, but I am very curious. I will watch all 3 seasons.
I want KUINA and CHISIYA to at least make a minor appearance 😢
plzzzz don't make it sad ending like squid game
If arisu died , netflix i will kick your ass for real 😡
player 222 eliminated
IF A BABY WINS AGAIN NETFLIX I WON'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE
Can't wait for the episodes....
Ok but where is chisiya
Finally on September 25th 🔥🔥 Netflix in 2025 : 🥳🎉 🔥
broo why do they always drop bangers during my exams
Chisiya where 😑😑😑
Laser hits Arisu?  Maybe just one of the indefinite possibilities- Don't need that at all!
Where is the white hair character😢😢😢?
Where is CHESHYIA ??!!
I LITERALLY GASPED WHEN I SAW THSS OML AND PLEASE NO THE SQUID GAME ENDING Y'ALL I AM NOT READY FOR THIS
where's chishiya and kuinna 😭
well that was something
Where's chishiya
S1 is best I don't like s2 and s3 look cool
Way better than Squid Game
So the first game according to the manga is the last game here in the series (firing arrows)  Also the spin off series is included too, it seems
Because of squid game 3, people are now praying not to be like squid game 3 in Alice in borderland 😂😂😂
agh finally
Unpopular Opinion : This is better than Squid Game :D
Where is chishiya
🫡🔥🔥🔥
Where’s my kuina 😢😢😢
Maybe baby win because arisu is laying on ground with lots of blood like she died and then the boy also get laser on his head 😢 theory😁🔪
WE WANT CHISHIYA 🔥 👇
This is interesting🎉🎉
Mfs just comparing SG with this legendary series mimicking the horse dialogue, that's just so annoying bc you cannot compare that trash with AIB. They are not the true AIB fans.
Now this is how a masterpiece looks like ...😍
2:02 DONT TELL ME THATS ARISU ISTG
2:18 worst part
The story is different but some of these games are from the manga that the show skipped, for example the one with the arrows was done before arisu's friends had died
1:42 IS THIS A ZOMBIE?
I remember reading the manga a long while ago and never really watched the show, but damn, nothing of this seems familiar to me. Guess they went down a very different route with the show?
Where is Chishiya?😒
Where is chisya
It better not have the same ending as Squid game😭😭
My comment might be spoiler but i want to say something bout some of those game on trailer and connect it to manga  That gas mask usagi wear on train really resamble shibuki (the girl who come to arisu gang back in 1st season) first game and its 3❤ but i can be wrong since why they plot usagi to ❤ game hahaha.  And that firework on temple is literally the first game that arisu play when arrive to borderlands in the manga and its so cool
Goddamn, it is the joker card😯
Dear Netflix it's high time to release All of us are dead s2 trailer as well
Chishiya is jobless I think😂🥲
Hermoso
Help. Why does that train game look like 2ohearts? And I can't wait for this season!
0:59 hello Jinx
MY FAVE IS BACK 🔥🔥
season 3 will be such a mystery before its released because it’s not in the manga
Season 3 will not be based on the original source material anymore, because season 2 is also where the manga ended. This is an original story by the show's creators. First I was skeptical, because the original ending was pretty good standalone and they could've just ended it there. But now I am actually curious what they came up with. Now that I've seen the trailer, I'm quite faithful that it will actually turn out good, so I'm looking forward to it( ´∀｀ )b
Best series ❤
2:03 WHAT DO YOU MEAN ARISU DIES? IS THAT EVEN ARISU WHAAAAAT
we are not alices, we are borderlands 🤌🔥
1% of comments: Where are Chishiya and Kuina 1% of comments: Netflix doesn't state that this is the final season so will there be a 4th season  98% of comments: hoping Arisu doesn't pull a gi-hun
I think baby survived like @squid game
🎉
Bro if ANY of my fav characters die like arisu, usagi and the others ofc im suing
Ann my beloved
Shit arisu dies with laser

If arisu dies I actually will cry myself to sleep bcs omg I don’t want a squid game repeat 🫩🫩
Not like others that are just keep saying it will be like squud game if baby win we will do this and that...... honestly i like the trailer and salute to the struggles that put efforts to make it true.i dont care either chishiya is not here or arisu die ,i just craving for the struggle of living .happy to see arisu usagi and also our great Ann and also new characters they are truly interesting and looking so so much strong...
The last season was already great enough, why they keep making more 😭
Where is chisya
Where is chisya
they're pulling a squid game i already know it
🎉🎉❤❤❤
Let's go
wow
1:03 yokuso dialogue brings back aizen
Where is chishya🤨?
Underated masterpiece 💀😍
"Any wound can become reason  to live.." peak writing
Where is Aguni?
Where is chishiya😢
they're literally protecting the appearance of chishiya,the hype will be unreal!!
Where is chishiyaaaaaaaaaaaa
Whoa wait they reworked the Subway game into being one usagi does, cool, also I kinda want to see them try to adapt borderroad
Japanese?
CHISHIYA AND KUINA WHERE
I am looking for two queens Chishiya and Kuina!!!!!!!!!!! Queens I am begging you STAND UP!!!!!!!!!! WHere are youuuuuu
Chills literal chills
2:02 please don't tell me, he dies in this scene...
To the people asking will there be Kuina, so she won’t be in season 3 because the actor was pregnant during the filming.
Arisu 😢
No, not arisu saying " we are not cards, we are humans and humans are....."
ARISU DON'T YOU DARE DIE!!!
Arisu, please dont die in season 3 😢
I love this show, but I hope this season isn't just a drag for money
I have a theory on how the joker game will be played: - I think the players will be askwd to draw a card from the deck that the joker is holding, and the csrd that they draw will be the game that they are required to play. The game is won when they draw the joker card and win the joker game.
1:00  Yo Kuso Watashin... My Bad Wrong Series 🧘
1:42 zombies!??????
Arisu stop showering!
Where is Chishiya?! 😭😭😭
1:38 istg if the baby....
Peak death game is back
Why is this trailer on cinema quality?
Guys i think alice in borderland right now
No fcking way where's CHISHYA 😭😭😭😭😭😭
1:03 Watashi no wa Soulreee Society...
we want chhisiya!!!!!
Where the hell is chishiya??????????????????????
omg I cannot wait anymoreee for this masterpiece
If there is no chishiya this season sucks
lol folks love comparing this to squid games even though squid games actually had a large impact on the world/took the world by storm, alice in borderland fans need to give up and just enjoy their lil show
Please dubb in Telugu language also❤️😢
1:37 Squid game season 3 end 😭
2:03 isn't it arisu???!!!
What if arisu & usagi's child also joined the game & for saving his own child,arisu gonna sacrifice his life bcz Netflix added a romantic angel of arisu & usagi,so it might be happen that we're gonna lose one of them😓💔
Chishiya? Kunia? Aguni? Niragi? 👀 either it's gonna be a huge surprise or a massive disappointment 😞
And like everyone's asking where's Chishiya?
I can't wait. Just release it now
First of all who is Arisu man, everyone looks the same except the girl who fights. And second, this looks boring.
What the hell is that 2:03 😢😢 Is Arisu dying ?? Don't they understand we don't want sad ending ?
So long story short they are doing a season 3 based on a mix of Borderoad and Retry, with at least 1 or 2 games that were supposed to be shown already in season 1 if I'm right, I have to say I'm quite scared about what will happen I feel like they might have butchered the story but we'll see I guess.
ようこそ
Unlimilited posibilities means arisu death could be one, either real or fake. but looking at the trailer, the option is picke to save her girl.
Where is chishiya?
Great competition for incoming kdrama
So sad Chishiya won't be in this season 😢😢
Damn! Waiting for so many years 🎉 Finally 😢
Chishya.....? 😢
Where is chisiya?
clock it arisu
I just wanna see the queen of hearts return for whatever reasons
I thought season 2 was the ending but their is more, wow 😮
Ready to go down the rabbit hole for the last time because this long game has impact and be careful of the joker gor with every joke it can be real if you believe it is real
Yooo... Arisu if you did that dumb af thing which 456 did, then😩💔
Chisiya❤
Better than "Squid Game" 😂
WOW JUST WOW
Is it not there chishiya my favorite character 🙁🙁
Wow
Chishiya?
Such a great trailer
Where is Kuina, Chishyia, Aguni???? And the girl who survived in a boiling death game, don’t remember her name. At least Kuina, Chishiya and Aguni were the top cast since 1 season, where they are?🥲
Dope !
Chishiya ??😭
Noooooo Arisu Dead 😢
After Squid Game Netflix makes another checkmate move 🎉
Where the hell is chisiya!!!!

I AM SOOO EXCITED!!!
2:30 min of trailer but where is chishiya😢😢
WHERE IS CHISHIYAAAAA
If anybody is worried, at 2:04 Arisu doesn’t die. 1. Netflix won’t spoil that 2. It’s most likely just his imagination because we can see the black sides, which usually only happens when we are either in a character’s mind or there’s a dream😼
This is absolute cinema
arisu is empl*yed?
nvm arisu definitely dying
Now, this was what I was waiting for.
OMG I can't believe how excited I am 😭
Where’s chishiyaa
Idk if I'm scared or excited

DANGGGGG THE TRAILERRR SOOO GOOOOOD WHATTTT
It will not be fun to watch this webseries without Chisiya 😢
Arisu: EU JA JOGUEI TODOS ESSES JOGOS!!! 😂

Ctmmmmmmmm
The amount of development we have made from season 2 till season 3 is crazy
I SWEARRR IF ARISU OR USAGI DIEEEEDDDD 💔💔💔
I really hope Arisu Pull out some Genius moment or something atleast in this season (I know he had his moments but I want a solo and a big mastermind moment)
BANDA IS JOKER OR NOT ?

Can yall stop filling the comments with squid game lol i wanna see fan theories
ALRIGHT

Arisu : We Aren't Cards, We Are Players
Wrre is chsiya
Don't sacrifice that's all.
"this were your parent's belongings" ahh💀

Where is chishiya?
Was that Chota?
❤🎉

1:12 im gonna accept my fate
เนื้อเรื่องมันจบไปแล้ว เอาภาคต่อที่ไหนมาอีก สร้างแล้วได้เงินจนติดลมงั้นรึ? สงสัยคงอยากตาม squid game 3 สินะ

SO HYPED FOR THIS ❤❤❤
CHISHIYAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????
I still don't understand why people compare this and Squid Game. They are so different.
ARISUDIED WTFFFFF
There seems to be a drastic shift in the tone of season 3 (based on the trailer) compared to the previous seasons. It almost feels dystopian. Still amazing and entertaining though.
1:37 "Despair... or hope"  *Monokuma giggling intensely*
This looks HUGE!!
Guys arisu not gonna die in season 3 trust me 🙏 because Netflix doesn't show the ending in a trailer, and maybe they're not showing chishiya in a trailer but they can show him in a series
Looks like Ann will only help Arisu to re -enter the Borderland, so there will only be Usagi and Arisu who enter the game from previous season
Where is chisiya?
U throw a moon at me again n I'm gonna lose it
Is banda joker then?
So no chishiya and kuina?
NOW i 100% sure what i expect they gave us  this seasons also be the best season list 1and 2
please , I hope it's not this predictable
ARISU, USAGI GAMBATEEE😭😭
Plz Let Main Character Win This Time, We Are Still In Gi-Hun Trauma 😭
MISS CHISIYA😭😭
2:04 WAS THAT ARISU??
Too excited 😮😮😮

"Human are not cards, humans are..."
Chisiya,kuina???????😢
Guess it's a perfect excuse to rewatch the entirety of seasons 1 and 2 :)
Chishiya😭
Where is chisiya
It's like a inception they are entering game intentionally so even if they die they don't die actually in irl.
Release it now
😢 Aarisu
It feels like Arisu will follow the same path as Gihun.
I AM SO READY YES
this time everything gonna be graand🔥🔥🔥🔥
Netflix what have you done 🤯 More season more excitement can't wait for it ❤
Highlight insightful viewer comments in videos.
Wow I cant wait to see what they have in store this season
I am big fan of this series.😊😊 Love from India ❤
Why does Netflix seem so fixated on showing the main character getting harmed or killed in its trailers?  . . does this mean arisu will die ?
I am telling you guys arisu is about to die
WHERE IS KUINAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????????
Where is my beloved chisiya😢
Fireee
I am move in next month in Tokyo ❤
Is that the train game?
wow they bring the very first game from the manga to season 3! thats interesting..  let us hope this is really the end, forcing a possible sequel like octopus game will be bad 😅
We guys are truly exited for this masterpeice
Anyone watch today?
Where is chishiya?
No Chishiya 😢
Where is Chishiya man 😬
where is chisiya😭
they are just milking series at this point
I am super excited.. Thank you for giving episodes all together.. This new format pisses me off
Trailer looks so intense...
TABAAHI .. DESTRUCTION 🔥🔥
im calling it one of them is gonna die😭
Why we miss in s3 chishiya why? Netflix
I have a feeling it will not end like squid game. This will be epic🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I don't even remember what happened in the first two. 😅
Arisu better not pull a Gi-Hun
Most of the comments are reference from squid game 😂
ARISU LOOKS EMPLOYED !!! HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A JOB AND NOT HOMELESS CLOTHING  ARISU HAD A FULL UPGRADE
THE FINAL CARD "THE JOKER" IS THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE CARD TO BEAT IN ALICE IN BORDERLAND THAT IT WOULD CAUSE THE DEATH OF USAGI OR EVEN THE MAIN CHARACTER ARISU.😔💔
This gonna be Epic!!!!
Kuina Chisiya?
well this looks traumatic as hell but ARISU AND USAGI ARE TOGETHER SO HELL YEAH
i genuinely forgot that time passes differently in there and thought 2 minutes was short 😭
1:38 Arisu and Usagi's Child???!!!!!! Tf???!!!!!!! 😯😯😯😯😯
OMG ANN COMEBACK
🤩🤩🤩😍😍📈📈📈❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:58 NEW DIVA UNLOCKED💜
i hope its not retarted like squid game 3
Blue haired Girl is a Chishiya replacement I'm calling it.  And another thing, that fire arrow game looks worser than the manga version, what do you mean it's a fire arrow rain?!  These games look worse than season 2 games
Where is my chishiya?😢
Please for f's sake Netflix don't pull another Gi-hun on us 😢
Where's chisiya??????
please give them a happy ending, I don’t want to cry. Please happy ending, like they love each other! Happy ending Please!!!!! ❤
OMG can't wait but where my king chishiya and queen kuina
Wow ❤❤❤ wait for it
Where is chisiya..?
0:30 is cool
The better squid game
I will be missing Chishiya,Kuina,Niragi and Tatta so bad 😭🤧❤️
where the f*ck is chishiya?
The first time I saw true peak was when I watched Attack on Titan. The second time was when I watched AiB.   We're witnessing the end of a masterpiece folks
First player456 second arisu then Steve Harington what is going on Netflix 😢😢😢😢
If there is no chisiya in season 3  I will not watch it😢
No chisya???
Where is Chisiya?😭
Can't wait for this peak of excitement
Where is Chisiya 🥲
Real game is back 👹🤧👹
Season 3 vibes — darker, deadlier, better 🔥
I'm a newbie for this. How good is season 1. Anyone can tell so that I watch it
Where is kuina ???😢😢😢
aint gonna lie but it gave me chills😬
Ooooh huhh
is testing our patience
Chishiya missing
AIB>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Squid games
Why is everyone talking bout arisa being gihun 😂
Damn !!!!❤
Please dub in telugu also please....
Please bring back Captain Fall season 2!
Chisiya will not be there?
Alice in Borderland games are always more hard and more strategic than Squid game in my opinion . This is gonna be so epic . I hope they don't drag too much as most of the source material is already covered in s2
I think we become banda fans in s3
A million times better than Squid Game…yep, I said it.❤
Surely the Joker will be John Kramer
Where is Arisu's fluffy hair 😭🫠🤧❤️
FINALLY???!!!!!!
im done here shibal..
Hindi?????
Chishya 😒 is not there or any twist 🥲
well well well

Let's go!
Who was expected chishiya😢
Arisu: we are not cards we are human...s and humans are
Ini yg ku tunggu
It's could have been better to leave it in Season 2
omg omg OMG!!!!
It’s finally here
Much better than squid game ❤❤
I thought the manga was over 🥴👍🏼

My friend was very excited when she heard s3 is going to be released this year and she was eagerly waiting to watch it but she died in August this year 😢
Is Kuina still here?
Its like inception type concept
2:03 is that what i think it is
I miss chishya and kiuna😢
WE ARE SO BACK
Goosebumps guaranteed 🔥
deadly games, a baby, s3 - I think I have seen this film before, and i didn't like the ending :/
Bring back Inside Job Netflix!

ARISU
Be happy that it happened. The last season of AIB 🫡
Plzz Give Us Some Good Ending, Don't repeat as Squid Game 😢

The release date was the best birthday present I could ever have.
Arisu and Gihun do provide an interesting entertainment to Ryuk- Angel of Death
Bro ain't no way I saw a baby
So Ann will be there for like a cameo?
The most horrifying games are coming this year🥶🥶🥶🥶
This video showcases the official trailer for "Alice In Borderland" Season 3, a highly anticipated series on Netflix. The trailer is fast-paced and intense, giving a glimpse into the gripping storyline and high stakes of the game. The visuals are stunning, with impressive set designs and visual effects that heighten the suspense. The cast looks strong, with familiar faces like Kento Yamazaki and Kento Kaku returning. Overall, this trailer sets high expectations for the upcoming season, promising a thrilling and action-packed continuation of the hit series.
Well! we get to see Miyoshi Ayaka at least there is something to look forward too! 😊
Chishiya ? Kuina ? 😢
netflixxxx...please let me studyyyyyy😩😩
Can't wait 😊
@Netflix Dear Netflix, I humbly request that you renew the series 1899. Please consider giving it another season..!!
If you like more than squid game  Hitt like button ✅❤
Ann 😮
This series looks good 👍🏼
I think arisu died in this season 😶‍🌫
I think the scene where arisu got killed was not real if you look after that scene we can see arisu sleeping i think it was  a dream he got killed i hope this theory is true
Alice in Borderland ❤🔥
its not going to be the same without chishiya and mother kuina 😭😭
I swear if Arisu pulls a Gihun move, I'm gonna rate this an absolute zero
omg why can't shows just end nowadays? s2 ending was perfect but sure let's make another season of something that is already completed and remove the entire reason for the ending just to milk more money from ppl bc we can't come up with something new or original
Netflix thinks all the male protagonists in all the shows must sacrifice themselves 💩
What was that at the end?😟
Where is chisiya
one month to go huff.... its hard to wait still i am happy atleast  i am getting season 3 but i am also afraid as there season 3 is not based on original source material so i hope they dont ruin this like they ruin the korean SWEET HOME. but still trailer looks good. will rewatch season 1 and season 2 again as this jdrama is my favorite but idk most of my favorite shows dont get season 3 and those who get season 3 they ruin they show example SWEET HOME, SQUID GAME, MONEY HEIST, WHAT IF, THE WITCHER ....etc etc,....
Where the fk is chishya 🤔 I didnt see him
previous seasons was really too good.still season3 not getting any attention and hype i wish this drama should become more popular
Don't want end like squid game 😢😢😢
If a baby wins I'm removing my zygote
I am so excited ❤🥰😊
Ohh I am so excited! 😁😁
the peak
It's fantastic
Watching trailer no one. But comment on squid game 😅
My favourite series of all time alice in borderland 🃏🗿💀☠️
Goodbye Chishiya RIP 😢. He will never come back.
1:12 THE GAME FROM THE MANGA AND ANIME NO WAYY
So… No Chishiya….
he looks like he actually showered🥹🥹
I can't believe Dori Sakurada isn't in this season. That guy is one seriously underutilised Japanese talent.
This is what trailer it is , very excited for season 3❤🃏🗿
We want telugu
cgi and story better than squid game s3
New game begins now ❤❤
“He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit” Titus 3:5
Is this the final season?😳
USAGI AND ARISU 🥹🥹🥹🩷🩷🩷 PLS SURVIVE
Oh, cool. They're adapting some of the content cut from the previous seasons (the arrows, the train with gas masks). And mixing in elements from Alice on Border Road.
Oh my god Arisu is doing the same thing as the people involved with the duty in Alice on Border Road...  It's looking kinda bleak for Arisu bruh unless they stray from the source material in terms of how the Borderlands work.
aaaaah finally!
Where is Chishiya 😢
Absolute cinema
Better than 🐙 game
What are we? Are we humans? or.. are we..? SAY IT
Can't wait🔥🔥🔥
Why don't I see Chishiya?
Arisu & Usagi 😍
I am expecting chisiya to be in trailer but sadly he is not here😢anyway we all miss your character 😔..
I dont read manga so i dont know what will be the ending of this series but i watched season 1 and 2. What i dont understand is how come arisu and usagi are the only main characters back in the s3. Whats the sense?  If the others are back in the real world?
Is that guy banda is joker
Not the Baby again...
🔥🔥🔥
Oh yes 🥶
Ohh come on... feels like less ppl are excited to enjoy this masterpiece and more are afraid that Arisu won't be second Ghun!
We are not cards we are humans, and humans are....  *Dies*
Missed opportunity to say "Jokers are wild"  Despair & Hope, are we in the the Danganronpa universe?
I didn't know there was a Season One,  or 2😂
I don't see chisiya
Where is the show stealer Chishiya😭
So banda is joker 😮 I am confused
people literally didnt understand the ending of squid game so sad🙁
Where is our Chisiya
Y DO I HAVE A FEELING ARISUS PULLING A GI HUN
not a single glimpse of chishyia bro 🥀💔💔
Spoiler alert: the baby wins the end
Oh I swear if they didn't include  chishiya kuina niragi and uguni!!!
They are bringing this season  3 a lot of games that were in the manga alice in borderland. Super happy there bringing alot of them back
It will be so funny if a CHILD wins Alice in the Borderland too.  Like yeah make these big money series only go make the newborn win.    Unlike many I won't mind. 😂
Where is chisiya
Absolutely Mind blowing
I SWEAR IF THIS ENDS TO BE ANYTHING LIKE SQUID GAME W A BABY WINNING OR ARISU PULLING A GIHUN IMA CRASH OUTT I CANT TAKE IT ANYMOREEE😭😭😭
Emotionless series😂. They should learn from squid game
The date sep 25 is actually my birthday 💀💀
El prota por fin hace algo esta temporada o necc? 😅
hope story is good.
This is brilliant, and way better than the rather overrated Squid Game.
Nice to see a lot of Squid game and aib fans
Not the Squid game references 😂
I hope no ones sacrifices themselves for a baby
IM GOING CRAZYYYY
We need shishya😢😢😢
It looks epic. Can’t wait!
Comparing to last season this season gona be epic💥 and emotional ♥️
1% of comments: actually talking about the trailer 99% of comments: praying that this doesn’t end similarly to Squid Game
Arigato udimassa
I kind of like Arisu’s more unemployed bum looking attire and hair. Now he’s wearing a suit? Unheard of.
Wheres Chisya...
Is this guy from the queen of heart game.... The murder
IF I SEE A SINGLE CGI BABY OR A MENTION OF HORSES IM OUT
I don't like this trailer chisaya didn't aura farm😢
WHATS HAPPENING I STILL DIDNT UNDERSTOOD BUT WHAT....
but yeji but itzy, is not really joining the show?
Can't wait for this banger!!
i was waiting for this
I wander if Banda is supposed to replace thé actual joker face ( not to spoil who it is ) from thé manga here
Arisu is so screwed dude 😭💔

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wheres chishiya 😢
Once again 💯❤️
Releasing during  Durga Puja Holidays. That's Perfect
Where's Kuina ?
Arisu gonna, "and humans are..."
I have a feeling arisu isn’t gonna make it 💔
As much as I love season 1 & 2 & this trailer, I have a feeling netflix is trying to milk the hell out of this series like they do for all their other shows, the ending for s2 was perfect & there was no need for a 3rd
Waiting for tamil dubbing triller
BITCH WHERE THE HELL IS CHISHIYA
Chishiya??????
Where is master chishiya moderfucker
Damnnnnn ❤❤❤
Arisu really cleaned himself up and looks more mature. Can't wait to see domestic Arisu and Usagi only to have them return to the Borderlands
What an epic show ❤ this what really mean watching on edge.. cause u don't know what gonna happen .. can't wait and also can't believe it is the end
No baby need to win 😢
NO NIRAGI??? At least we have Ann
Bruh seriously.. arisu dies? 😂Wth is wrong man ... First squid game now this?
have high hopes this season will somehow be better than the last 2 and that is diabolical looks hella entertaining
1:10 nobody aint survivng that🥀🥀
so hype
Arisu better not pull gi hun just for the baby..
❤
Season 2 finale was already perfect we didn't need season 3, so you better not mess it up Netflix just to milk money.
Where is cheshiya ?😢
Ooh seems like this season's gonna be epic as well😼🔥❤️
Arisu: "We're not Cards... we're humans... And humans are..."
where is our cast? why only arisu and usagi??
This looks wild asf
Ending probably gonna have arisu become the joker to save usagi
Arisu ki emina kavali naa koduka motham thagalapettestham 😡 orey Netflix niku dhadam pedutham rare main characters lepaku raa😢
Well, it can't be any worse than Season 2 I guess.
There's a big chance Arisu boutta pull a Seong Gi-hun ----- wouldnt be surprised if he does.
IDK ABOUT EVERYONE, I JUST WANT ARISU AND USAGI TO NOT DIE😭😭😭
2.03 what the-  WHY DID ARISU GET SHOT??
Where is chisiya
OMG THEY ADDED THE 2 OF HEARTS GAME SHIBUKI PLAYED
0:17 ohhh prince alain is back
Ann my queen
Ref do something
Masterpiece❤❤
Finally
Ab ayega na maaza benchod
If the baby's winning, I'm not watching it
THEY BROUGHT THE ORIGINAL GAMES BACK FORM THE MANGA!???????
I cannot wait
Date change wow🤡
This look  ai
YESSSS BANDAA OMG MY BOY
One of the best show from netflix, worth to watch 🥰
God level
Netflix: another show with baby and protagonist saying " I have played these games before.."💀 Viewers: we all have seen this before 😭😭
Chisiya where?
WAIIIIT WHATTTT
2:03 yang bener aja...
WHERE IS CHISHIYA AND KUINA
Where is chidiya ??
bro squid game gave me depression, now AIB, please don't let me down 😭😭😭😭
so ann didnt go back just help arisu find the way back there
OMGGG. I GOT GOOSEBUMPSSSSSS
Tamil dubbed varuma
EXCUSE ME WHY DOES HE GET LASERED
No Shuntaro Chishiya then this will have less viewers. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about this but I'll also be honest that Shuntaro Chishiya got tons of fans that are eager to see him again
This series ended so perfectly but I like the fact that they added all the pars they cut from the manga and using them for S3 that's peak right there
2:03 they just revealed his 💀
We miss chishiya
AIB >>>>>>>
Holy shit This is more intense than squid game. Can't wait for the episodes 😊
Ho is you junko enoshima why you talking bout hope and despair???
Rumors says that anne hattaway is there guest star 😮😮😮😮😮
Idk , this looks "modified" in the worst way  I'll give it a chance tho cuz I love AIB
Spoilers: the baby wins and it is revealed that the borderlands is also happening in the US
Kuina you are missed!
Where’s kuina
Where is chisiya ??
Wait there are not horses in it , right ?
Exciting!
If arisu dies,I will delete my Netflix account
Sooooo excited! Looks so good
GOOSEBUMPS 😮🔥🔥
Qué emoción!!!🎉
Aane da
I just realised the theory of Ann remembering everything is CORRECT she remembers Arisu and Usagi and tells him to go back to borderlands to save her.
I don't like this trailer at all...🙂🥺 Why i feel like something devastating will happen in this series? 🥲.....Just like in Squid Games Season 3...
Ladies and gentlemens the real game started 🎉
If arisu also said "we are not Cards , we are humans" I'll lose it.
Dang I like it
Finally !!
OMG?
YOOO
WHERE IS CHISIYA
i don't want to spoil but at the end of the video Arisu and Usagi will die !!!!!!!!!!
Arisu : "we are not cards we are humans and humans are" 🪦
HOLY SHIT
cant wait
ONE MORE GAME!✊
So no chisiya?
Arisu better save Usagi!❤
I can’t wait!!! So glad it’s back🎉
Once again, Netflix doesn't know where to stop and have to ruin every interesting show once it gain a bit of success... Is it that hard to end a show on a good note so that everyone keep some good memories about it? The meteorite explaination was perfect, not everything need to be milked
I am glad there is no chisya because i don't want another 120 i hope he stills makes a cameo plss🙏
Uwuwuwuw.. 😚
They used up all the source material for season 1 & 2 so most likely this season will be bad.
THIS 100% WILL BETTER THAN A FVCKING SQUID GAME SEASON 3
It doesn't look good bye
Peak ,also gives sao vibes
Korean women are so fine
Very excited❤
No Shuntaro Chishiya?
ts will be so tuff
WHERE IS CHISIYA
Chisiya...
We're getting manga games brought to netflix
Better than Squid Game
THIS BETTER THAN SQUID GAMES
Now it give inception.. with the clock and the serum to fall asleep and enter the Borderline
I am soooo curious as to what the third season will be about, because the manga ended with the second season and yes sure there was also a short sequel but that was just one game 9 of hearts with arisu and a group of totally new charakters, so definitely nothing to do with this trailer. And weirdly enough the fortune game where we see millions of arrows flying towards arisu and a few other people, was the first game that arisu, segawa and karube participated in the manga.  I just hope they dont make the joker the "Big Bad" of the Borderlands, because in chapter 63 of the manga, the joker asks arisu if he looks like a god or a devil and arisu answers that the joker is just the intermediator, essentially the messenger, not the big bad villain of the series but he just exists to make everything work.
The new cast literally my favorite actors and actresses i love it Will be missing some of the old cast that couldn't participate tho
ayyy nooo!! I just hope that in this show they don't give their lives for anyone just to teach us a moral lesson, I just hope that the main characters survive, I've been wanting a happy ending for a while without any bad taste at the end of the series, it's so hard for them to give us a happy ending lately in these shows HAHAHA I used to love those shows that ended tragically because they were unusual and for me they were more realistic hhahaha but I'm tired now, I want a happy ending even if it's illogical, I want to rest at least on the big screen hahaha
1:38 Arisu better not pull a sacrifice for a child.
waiting for this masterpiece
We are not getting Chishya?! How Pathetic... Still excited very much?
WHERES KUINA
Let's go! 🫶🏾
Don't say that Arisu will die like how Gi-hun. Where are all the old characters, I already miss them 🥺
I swear if the baby wins I’m ending my life💔💔💔
Man, idk but chishiya not being in this trailer feels empty
❤❤❤❤😮😮
2 days to Go !
1:08 is muzan here?
Plese dub Telugu
IF ARISU DIES YOU ARE NOT SEEING ME AGAIN
I had my worries but trailer is legit FIRE  Haro Aso, please cook hard with this one!!! This is THE ending for your masterpiece!!!  (For those who don't know, there is no "Joker" games in the manga, it's an original content!! They show games that were excluded previously, as well as completely new stuff. In manga, Arisu got back to Borderlands by accident and it was just one game with strangers, no Usagi, no Joker etc)
gamenya makin parah😭😭
The thumbnail looks like bb gandang hari 😮
Alice in Borderland games is much better and deadlier. 🙌
Chisya missing 😢
Chisiya missing 😢😢😢
Okay If He Dies Ama Crash Tf OUT LITERALLY 😢😂
Squid game - we are not horses, we are humans  Alice in borderlands - we are not cards, we are human
А где чишия?
Can't wait like it's very intense 😮😮😮😮
Damn this looks so great cannot wait to dive into borderland again 😍❤️🔥🔥
Looks like they will be using some of the unused games from the manga including the true 3 of clubs.
ARISU, DON’T YOU DARE PULL A GIHUN
if arisu pulls a gi-hun ISTG💔💔💔
Far better than squid game
Damn instead of Netflix announcing the bl they put the actor as the villain here instead :') GIVE US SOUL MATE RELEASE DATE NETFLIX
ANN!!
Yo this storyline looks trash and I loved season 1 and 2 pls don’t disappoint
Ommmggg ❤ I love this show so glad its renewed cheers to the cast n crew .. I hope Arisu finds peace n love for pete sakes 😢
Omg i just can't wait
without chisiya?
yes finally season 3 I waiting for this season and I watch season 1 & 2 but now we have season 3  wow I finally going to watch the season 3 on Netflix
I LOVED season 1 but honestly felt that season 2 jumped the shark towards the end. Here's hoping season 3 can live up to what season 1 managed to achieve!
1:02 who is this cutie?  And why yamapi alive again and with clothes?
banda such a bad b
Netflix can we please normalize having all the main characters make it out alive every once in a while💔
Arishu Came Back ❤
IF ARISU DIES AND A BABY WINS ISTG I'M GONNA LOOSE IT!
I hope no one's pregnant here 😂
2:03 Yo, WTF bro?? Firstly it was Squid Game and now Alice in Borderland . Then, Stranger Things 😭

credit card doesn't work when travelling to another country, pls fix
Guys please, this ain't squid game
HOLY SHITTTTT IM SO READY
I miss the rest of the casttttt 😭🫶🏻
They really said “we had left over games from our manga that we didn’t use…LETS MAKE AN ORIGINAL SEASON SO PEOPLE CAN NOT EXPECT SOME BS”  IM SO HYPPEREDDDDD AAAGHHH
They better have a good reason for continuing this story lol
Finally the wait is over☠️
Finally Season 3!!! September 25 here we goooo!!!
Arisu FTW!!!
NO WAYYYYYYYY, DON'T GIVE ME THAT FUNN CHEF NGGH DWLDU
Gak berani terlalu berekspektasi pada season 3.
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE
The moment we have been waiting for has finally arrived.
EPIC
❤
Let’s fvkkggg go
Wait. so how does Borderland work? I thought it was all just in their heads during the catastrophic event or something, somehow connected - but in comas.
Oh cannot wait; it’s almost here yaay!! 😊 Season 2 did wrap everything up so nicely in the end with still leaving that sense of wonder, just please don’t let season 3 let us down😊 PLEASE😊
Now that's what you call a trailer. The wait for 25th September is getting unendurable now. ❤❤
Where is chesia 😢
THIS LOOKS SO COOL OMGGGGG CANT WAIT
i saw someone say: when do you think the aib trailer will come out earlier today and i was gonna say “today” as a joke BUT IT ACTUALLY DID 😭
this show is top tier
Trailer be like ****la 🔥🔥🔥
I hope Dori comes back. Maybe Aya too. Nijiro as well though I know that he've been going through shi
Why we needed this seaseon
SHAKING CRYING ON THE FLOOR
BANDAA??
this series deserves top 1
This is hype
Spectacular show
I wonder why kuina, chishiya, aguni, etc didn’t come back for this season 😭😭
👑❤️‍🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🍾🥂💐
Am I the only ones that wants Aguni back?
🎉
why couldn’t they follow the manga spinoff 💔I’m so mad, I hope it’ll at least have agood ending as the manga has
We are not cards we are humans
Ahh baby again
We about to witness PEAK!
What the hack   😮 lava😮
🔥🔥🔥
YOOOO????? AYEEE
whos baby is that if a baby wins again ill cry😭😭
First Squid Game Season 3 from South Korea And Now Alice in Borderland Season 3 from Japan There are two Game of Death Show appearances in Season 3 was ABSOLUTE CINEMA OF NETFLIX
Can't wait to watch 😀❤️👍
I hope this is better than Squid Game.
I CANT WAIT❤
OMG a real one. I have been seeing fake on FB so many times. Thank God we get a new season next month.
1:42 zombie??
WHY IS THERE A BABY THERE!!?! 😰😰1:38
Kicks Squid Games ass every time every game
On  my Birthday Date tho
Nah crazy they are using games from the manga that they never showed in the live action, the game with the fire arrows is the first ever game arisu and his friends play in the manga which got replaced by "live or die" for season 1 episode 1. That game was terrifying can't wait to see it
Netflix killing every mc istg
1:42 The Zombie card game looks rlly good 🤩
💗💗💗
ARISU AND USAGI MARRIED OMGG
WHERE IS AGUNI, KUINA, CHISHIYA, NIRAGI
Chishiya 💔
They are doing the first game, 3 of Clubs from the manga wow.
OHH MYYY DAYYSSS
29 DAYS LEFT!!!
A REAL CINEMA IS BAAAACCCKKKK
They’ll milk this series to death. We didn’t need this.
finally... AiB destroys Squid Game all day
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
We are not horses we are humans and humans are
THIS IS CRAZY IM SO EXCITED RAAAAAAH
Here we goo!!!
I HAVE TRUAMA FROM SQUID GAME DONT DO THIS
OMG WHAT PLEASE DONT MAKE A SQUID GAME ENDING
Where are you kuina & heiya akane😭😭😭 why other cast is not here huhu.
Netflix always gives Surprise... its ending better not be not like some game where humans are....still thinking about it, humans are what a lot of choices can't complete the sentence. 😁
This is gonna be peak!
OMG
I didn't see Ann After 33s btw .  what if  she.... 😢
If the baby becomes a player I’m crashing out
so they're doing an "original" story for this S3, added some games from manga that didnt appear in S1-S2, add some element from Inception, also make the two criminal from S2 to become the Jokers.. i hope its not gonna be suck, netflix seems gonna milking AIB like they did with Squid Games
Spoiler The White Hoody Boy ....is the Kingman
no chishiya and kuina?😢
so it's not an adaptation of Alice in Borderland RETRY? wow, i'm fooled.
1:38 not the baby again...
i’m so excited
Usagi is the best part of Alice in Borderland show
AaaaaaaaAaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh ...  Me running around the room beside myself. Literally waiting since covid for this!!!!
Well, this season’s gonna suck only because two actor and actresses are going to be gone meaning the white dude and the transgender chick and honestly that’s pretty stupid and the reasoning of it is because one of them has depression booo whooo so does everybody else the other one I believe gave birth, but it takes a month after recovery because if you’re able to have sexual intercourse within three weeks of giving birth, you can obviously still act and role🤦🏻‍♂️🤡🤡🤡
yahoooo
MEMERAHHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh the tense in AIB aren't fake😟
Where’s chisya?
WHERE IS MY GIRL KUNA? WE NEED KUINA AND ANN DUO BACK
make the main guy live for once. We don't need creative controveresial endings lol, i miss plot armor
All this was not needed but lets go ig😭
O fim?
Ann BETTER not waste her entire ass trotting around the forest like she did in season 2. She BETTER not pull a jun-ho.
If that's Arisu and Usagi's baby im seeing, THEY BETTER NOT sacrifice themselves for it.
I m missing chishiya but it's okk bro we will wait until uh heal from ur pain or depression 🫥
I can't wait！！
Arisu!
I hope that Arisu wont sacrifce himself just to save someon's baby...
Is this releasing in Hindi or not?
Looks like they will bring the 3 of Clubs and the Two of Hearts back.
bro where's chishiya 🥀💔
Can anyone suggest me some good web series? I have membership of netflix, prime and disney+ I watched almost all famous shows so recommend me something different. Genre preference: thriller, drama, crime, suspense, mystery, history, war, true story, action (but not too much action) I don't like horror, sci-fi and super hero shows like the boys, stranger things, GOT so don't recommend me like these. Thanks in advance 🙏
1:38 Now it seems to me that this scene with the baby, Arisu and Usagi and the scene of Arisu taking laser are simulations that they made for Arisu of what he can have in the future
impressive. but ive been waiting for a while for the season 2 of the Avatar The Last Airbender live action. when will it be out?
2:03 wtf? i thought they were gonna follow retry but ig not?
ITS LITERALLY THAT GUY FROM SOLIDARY CONFINEMENT I CALLED IT
Arisu olmemeli ve chishiya,kuina yoklardı umarım dizi'de görürüz usagi ölürse bende olurum😰🤭
Been waiting for this to come🎉
Truly hate how you can’t watch any trailer for this amazing show without unnecessary comparisons to Squid Game. Both great and completely different in their own right. This show deserves to stand on its on completely separate from that lne
Yo that shi will be so hard and I hope that wasn't ariso who died,crossing fingers for a happy ending not like squid game 🤞😔
Where are Kuina and Chishiya?
I had a good friend I use to love watching this show with, now we don’t talk and season 3 is coming 😩🤦‍♂️
September 25th! This looks so good!
The joker is gonna make an appearance  and he is a true godlike entity in the borderland world so our characters are gonna up against a god who will turn the game into his favor.
They're milking it at this point, the original source already ended. Yes there is an Spin-off (the Retry ver) but as I can see in this trailer, it isn't like it, the storyline doesn't follow that.
WOWOWOWOWOWOOW IM SO EXCITED,🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Where is chishiya?
I screamed when i saw this notification.
worth the wait
Man the new borderlands show looks crazy
We back
WHERE IS CHISHIYAAA
I want Chishiya in season 3
ARISU!!! DONT PULL THE GI-HUN 💔💔😭
Alice in Peakland🔥🔥💯💯
Oh my God I'm so excited!! It's coming next month and I can't wait miss this masterpiece 😩🔥
Yayyy
I CANT WAIT
0:45 hasn’t Shibuki played this?
I think the games are poisonous train, fortune, hot potato and battle ship
did i just see a baby.
No chishiya and kuina 😔 💔
So we get to see Arisu curl up like a gayboy again??
2:04 Nah hell nah man
1:36  HELL NAH WHO IS THAT BABY BRO
cant wait...😍
1:05  Im gonna freaking lose it. I can't cry myself to sleep AGAIN bro... if one of the characters I like dies, I'm going with them.
Very good 😊
Last season was so intense
HEY SO LIKE YOU SHOULD BRING BACK MY GLORIOUS KING TATTA 💔💔
YES YES YES OMG ANN MY QUEEN
At the end... I know that ain't who I think it is. What the eff?! 🫣
Glad to see the manga's original first test onscreen.  Wonder if they'll take anything from Borderland Retry.
Is that Chishiya 1:46 ...????? 🎉
wait so death is the only way to get into the borderlands and u need to fight to get out of it to come back to life so we wont be getting old characters back
arisu inceptionned himself into the borderlands lol
QUE EMOCION NO PUEDO
LOS AMO QUE
They want us to believe Banda will be the main villain but, in a later plot twist, they will reveal the real villain aka the Joker will be the guy on the wheelchair. Save this message guys.
No way its happening!Season 3!!!!
Hand down… better then squid game..
I hope it’s not the rebirth story line. But I’ll be watching. My favorite show on Netflix.
WHERE IS CHISHIYA DUDE
OMGG YAYY

oh hell yeah Ann's back babyyyyyyy
I think I know who is the joker
One of the best shows I have EVER watched.  I remember watching my wife watch this and I was like "meh, what is this.." and then I got totally enthralled by it.   Can't wait.
Arisu is not a card, he is a human
This is finally here 😊
so happy kento kaku is in this season
Arisu: "I've played these games before"
Notice how squid game's trailer for s3 had 10x the views after an hour than AIB? proves how squid game clears this petty show
I don't want arisu to die
I am so sad that niragi and chishya and kuina and heiya are not coming back for s3
Imagine they put chisiya on thumbnail 🥶
I have to rewatch the last episode of season 2 cuz I could’ve sworn they all woke up from an earthquake or something.
Aib >>>> squid game
Omg I can't wait
Gyattttt damn!!!
😮😮😮😮😮 love from pakistan
Chishya is coming 🥶
A BABY ????
ARISU VIVIRA, ARISU, VIVIRA 🙏🏻
I was eagerly waiting for this.😅
will it be released in parts or the whole season at once
Finally ❤
I hope that Arisu wont sacrifice  himself just to save someone's baby
Arisu looks like a corporate guy 😮 Can’t wait for that epic season !!!
FINALLYYYYY 😭😭😭
Chishiya’s mind games just got a whole new level in Season 3. That calm genius, mixed with his new ‘heartbeat’ after the King of Diamonds clash—he’s not just playing to survive anymore, he’s playing to change the game forever. Borderland’s deadliest chess master is back, and no one is safe! 🔥♠️
2:03 was it just spoiled that arisu gets shot by a laser and dies? He was by an exit here, where he got hit by the laser and earlier in that video it was shown that he was standing infront of a door where the outside world was, so what I think he gets shot by a laser right before exiting for the second time (he goes back for someone, maybe usagi or someone else but get shot in the head by one)
bruh stop playing in my face dont pull a squid game
I'm actually so worried for this season oh my gosh.
Finally arisu gets a shower🎉
Arise better not pull a gihun😔✌️
Finally 😅
A BABY?
Let's go, bring it to me
I'm glad we haven't seen a baby in the Borderland so far.
For anyone who hasnt watched the series, it is quite underrated and although I love Squid Game, but Alice in Boderland is just way more intense and adrenaline filled with the most mindbending twists. You will get hooked in just the 1st episode. 😍 Excited for S3!!!
wheres our chishiya
okay, i had goosebumps
Season 1: Shock.  Season 2: Trauma.  Season 3: Therapy bills incoming 💀🔥
Its confirmed arisu is gone now... dont be in denial cause it was proven in this vid form the ''I'll accept any fate'' then the same shot from the teaser...
Black Mirror meets Squid Game. Looks interesting
WHO IS THIS BLUE HAIR LADY YEA QUEEN
Can't wait for Thanos to be like: " my boy Arisu!!"
Ya mas claro esta q Arisu se va a morir, Netflix bajale tantito, queremos un final feliz
Lowkey gonna miss Kuina Chishiya Aguni and Ann :'))
LET US HAVE AN HAPPY ENDING PLEASE
If this trailer doesn’t give you chills, do you even love Alice In Borderland? This season’s gonna be next level 🔥🤯
bruh bring unemployed arisu back 💔
if arisu pullls a gihun im quitting
if arisu pullls a gihun im quitting
2:03 this has to be a misdirect, surely they wouldn't spoil the main characters death in the trailer ?
please let Arisu and Usagi be alibe !! please!!!! they deserves to be alive 😢😢😢
wait NO I SAW A BABY. IF BRO PULLS A GIHUN IM GONNA GO TO MOUNT EVEREST AND LIVE THERE FOR THEREST OF MY LIFE
I hope Chishiya appears at least as cameo😢
All comments begging to not end like Squid Game.... Im joining in
ARISU 😭😭
I just hope they don’t ruin it like Squid Games
MOTHER ANN SPOTTED
I’m hyped for this
Where's my kuina????😭😭😭😭
i swear if niragi dont show up im gonna cry
Under an hour
I NEED NIRAGI!!! HELLO!?!?!??! WHERE IS NIRAGI!!!???????
WHERE IS NIRAGI BRO
4 weeks to go 😭 IS THIS A DREAM
So Netflix Can Show THIS But Not TADC Ep 5 & 6 With Not Nearly as Bad With Death?
broooo season 3 is so unnecessary thooooo. like s2 had the best ending
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
will niragi not play in this season?
i lowk miss arisu’s “i haven’t showered in three years” look 💔
I'm guessing we'll get answers, but this isn't making any sense to me. How  does anyone remember Borderlands after the end of season 2 and how do you go back? Maybe I just missed something from the first two seasons. And yes, I know there was one last card at the end of season 2.
I hope to see games from the manga such as 9 of hearts, Alien invasion. At 1:10, this is game from the manga, 3 of clubs, Good fortune Bad fortune.
bro said yokoso he thinks hes aizen
I'm really glad see to Ayaka again 0:31 cause she so fine 💕
i criticise you Netflix, but sometimes you make me love you a little bit.
see the squid game fans are already here, they releasing same day as Silent Hill f, and my goodness this looks good.
WTF volcanic
where is Aguni?
OMG, the arrow game! It was the very first game introduced in Manga and I was bummed that it was not included in the first season. I think we're getting it this season!
Prediction: the baby's winning again
if arisu dies...I DIE
if he dies i swear
Not following the original books is crazy😭
It seems they used some part of the Manga Alice in borderland Retry when they are about to have baby but have an accident and return to borderland and also some games that appeared in the first manga but not in the show like the burning arrows game
Everyone is comparing aib With Squid Game because they know Squid Game ist better😂
Oh shit I'm nervous
GOD I CANT WAITTTT T
“Any Wound can become a reason to live” 1:51
Looks like they’re mashing together a bunch of elements from the remaining source material, plus some of their own original ideas. Will that work? Not sure, to be honest.  I think all of them have solid potential to work fine, except for Banda being the face of the Joker card. The mystery of the Joker’s presence in the original story is exactly how it needed to be done. If Banda turns out to be the Joker, it’s pretty lame.  I think that I would’ve preferred them mashing together the premise of Retry with the plot of Border Road, rather than taking pieces from both and creating an original story.
Arisu will die remember my comment 😢
where's my fav duo ??
SO BANDA IS THE JOKER?????
WHERE'S CHISHIYA ?!
AAAAAAAAA
Im so excited for this 😅
Can’t wait
I want to watch but i don't want spoilers 😬
02:03 WHAT !?
WOW !!!
Cant wait brooo
they included the games from the manga they couldn't include in the first season!!!
Iam waiting ✋️ 😌 😊
Alice in Borderland 100% Scuid Game 90% 😂
Missing Chishya 😓🥹🥲
1:05 I was expecting Chishiya here …
Who is ready for New Season 👍🏻
I've been waiting for thisss omg
SEATED🪑
I have been waiting for this series especially to see Chishiya and now to find out he might not be in this season a little disappointed.
Imagine Arisu sacrificing himself for Usagi
Kento is the goat 🐐
😳🔥😭
this season looks so good omg
Looks great, I can't wait!
And finally
NETFLIX??!! Where are chishiya and kuina ???
NO PUEDOO ESPERAR MASS
Not the same without Chishiya and Kuina, need them both in season 3 asap! 🙏🙏
WHERE'S CHISHIYAAAAA
Dammmmm
00:03 BANDA 🔥
arisu job skin
Reminds me a little bit of Inception. This might be super epic!!! Can’t wait!
those 2 minutes probably felt like years
Yay another excuse to re watch the first 2 seasons
No real fun without Chisiya 😢😢
MANO PARA, TO COM ANSIEDADE
Peak, 2♥️ and 3♣️ of the manga
Aguni and chishya????????
We missed our Unemployed Arisu.
Dont ruin this like squid game pls
ARISU Please don't pull a Gi Hun Moved 😭
Ain't no way there's a baby in the show now... Yeah, here we go again guys
Still can’t believe it’ll be released on my bday week. The best gift EVER!! 🥹🃏
i didnt want season 3 because S2 had a perfect ending but oh well
😮🫨🫨🫨😰😰

None of this makes sense but LETS GOOOOO WOOOO🎉🎉

Damn i can't believe wtf i just watch it looks so so damn good 😭🔥🔥🃏🃏
This is sooo underrated
Arisu better survive or I won’t
حماااسسسسسسس 🏳️🔥🏳️
They said it wasn’t coming… they real quiet now.
🎉❤❤
People only compare Squid Game and Alice In Borderland with each other because they're both about Asians playing deadly games.
ARISU!
Link Start!
Squid game: 😍 Alice in borderland: 😍 People who compare them: 🗑
Ann is minee
F-I-N-A-L-L-Y
lets gooooo
we are so back babyyyy
NOT THEM GETTING MARRIED IN 'REAL LIFE' JUST TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE GAME. Please just let them be together
ARISU died!!!!
Arisu dies at the end.... wtf I actually thought the show had finished, season 3 I am up for it
This show is so good! I thought there wouldn't be a third season! Stoked.
Can't wait for this show 😍.   This is my favourite Japanese show. Both the seasons I have watched more than 10 times. Hope this season gives the same vibes as previous two seasons 🙏🏻✨
This looks amazing
Alice in bonderland>>>>>>>>squid game
Arisu: I PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE 😡😡
Where is Chishiya¿ 😭
AGHFHF
Omg🥹❤️can’t wait
ESRLYYY OMGGG
Dayum boiiii 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so excitedddd
i really need the season 3 rn!!!
Voy a extrañar mucho a mis dos personajes favoritos, Chishiya y Kuina, pero no mamen lo bueno que está el tráiler, ya la quiero veeeer.
Please arisu dont dead
I was done with season 2, not anymore   Well done Netflix
THIS IS GONNA BE SO PEAK
The dopamine surges from these trailers are actually everything
I wonder if they are including scenes from the manga that they didn’t adapt in the live action.
AAAAAH I CANT WAIT
osam
if arisu actually dies ill be so mad if they just spoiled the ending in the trailer like that 😣😣
This is what I have been waiting for years 😎
So Fire 🔥🔥💀
If this has the same ending to squid games imma be so mad
Masterpiece  🃏🃏🃏
This series is going to make me cry a lot.
Spiderland
To those of you asking, Chishiya probably won't return in season 3, or at the very most he'll make a minor appearance. The actor has been battling depression, so if he doesn't appear I'd be perfectly okay with that. He needs his space to heal.
Im so angry at Netflix for only making 3 seasons!!!
at least something good to watch
banda and yaba pmo sm omg
The real Squid Game starts here.
i really very disappointed with season 3 because there is no niragi no chishiya and kuina 🥺🥺🥺🥺
we are so back!!  hopefully we get to see a good and fair ending~
I'm sooo excited but also so scared😭😭😭
So I just noticed Ann only appears two times and both times she appears in a room, and also there’s a scene of someone shooting an of screen person, which makes me believe Ann dies.
Season 3 about to break us all 😭🔥
OMG YAY
It's absolutely peak❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 But i miss chishiya💔
Indian attendence 🎉❤
SO EXCITED
The heroes who watched the video less than two hours ago, gather here

Why risk ruin a perfectly fine ending?
So hyped for season 3🔥

Fans of arisu like my comment  ⬇️
WHERES CHISIYA BY BELLOWED, PLEASEEEE
Where is chishiya 😢😢😢
YEEEE
❤❤❤ my Love is back
In term's of Content with quality, K- drama are always 1
Just finished reading the manga, and it's sequel manga today, it was all amazing 💯. Now, I'm even more hyped for Season 3 of this show 💯. This is an amazing adaptation of the manga, Netflix/Hollywood actually cooked with this.
If you think about it kuina and chisiya not returning to borderlands actually makes things better kuina has her mom to think about and chisiya is a doctor and I also find it better this way because imagine if they did what if they actually died this time I wouldn't want to see that
Plot Twist : Better than Squid Games by miles
