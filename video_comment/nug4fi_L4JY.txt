One great lady❤
Roxette não sai de moda!  Atemporal!
It really is incredible how music can transport you through time. I heard this song last week in my car driving through the town where I grew up. For the briefest of moments, everything felt exactly they way it did when I was a 12 year old living in a world before teenage angst and grunge music.
Bellissima canzone.
God, you took this one angel too soon from us😢
ROXETTE und die LIEBE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
On November 14, 2025 a bus driver deliberately rammed into the crowd in a middle of Stockholm. This video is a testament to the beauty of a highly cultural and historically significant city and the real Sweden that we all mourn today.
no ai could ever replace her voive
Nice images 4k
AMAZING ROXETTE AMAZING SONG🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Conheço a banda roxette desde os anos 90, e a vocalista já lutava contra a doença que mais tarde veio com mais força!!! Sou grato pelas músicas lindas que soam como um hino nos dia de hoje!!!!
we miss you
Was this shot on film originally? Quality is excellent!
Velmi dobre
Excellent
Písně co mají sílu v každém věku❤☀️
If released today, no.1 chart hit again! Just incredible, timeless music.....
I prefer in 4:3 format
The remastered video looks epic 👏🏼 great job
Muito  linda as musicas  dela ❤
My first 90's at his best with Roxette amazing song's. Whoever you are, if you’re listening to this, you have a Very Good taste in music.  0:37 R.I.P. beautiful Marie Fredriksson 💞
Ca me ramène si loin en arrière. Marie est intemporelle. Qu'est ce qu'elle me manque ma Queen of Rain.
Even though its been years since her death, I admire her work. I wanted to use her stage name in one of my conferences but the fact that people in Germany never heard of her made me upset. A beautiful soul was among us. Enjoy it, like I'll enjoy until my time to come.
Dobry Jezu a nasz Panie daj jej wieczne spoczywanie  Pozdrowienia z  Polski

Amor.....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢
Tu chante trés bein et tu une femme trés belle ❤❤💋💋❤️❤️
THE BEST SONG 4EVER
THE BEST SONG ❤
Excellent, truly amazing track
Nonstop classics from the golden era. The 80s had a sound like no other, and this playlist captures it perfectly.
Marie in her prime and in high quality. What a gift it is to hear this. Easily one of the greatest female singers of ALL TIME. I can’t get enough of this version. What a Gem from 1991
Just seen the show yesterday at Budapest. To me, this is the top of the pop. I have seen Robbie Williams a month ago, and I would choose Roxette anyday over him (great show though as well). Please continue forever!!!❤❤❤❤
Os dias se passam, é Eu só penso nela. Pôr que? Porque há amo!!! Cátia um dia sem te ver, É algo que Eu não sei dizer, Um dia triste,um dia que não existe....
Legeand 🤟
November 2025 here?

감사합니다.
El cómico que hace el ridículo al costado de la gran Marie Fredriksson, es sólo el bajista cierto?
Williams uncl3 Spencer Shane cadwell
You know you're getting old and close to your time when you are out living the music you listened to 40 yrs ago. Or when you mention Live Aid and nobody knows what you're talking about.  Man oh man has music gone so far down hill. It's not worth listening to anymore. Thank God for cd's and disc players.
I miss her
The guitar performance in the latter part of the song acts as a refreshing agent^^🎸
❤❤❤❤you too
Fuking love for you too je vous aimes pareil ❤
Parabéns pela remasterização ficou perfeita parabéns pelo trabalho 😊😊😊
Lindeza de música ❤❤❤

Acá desde Paraguay...q hermosa ❤
Tänk att Sverige som liten nation har bästa musiken!!  Älskar Roxette..Abba  plus i oändlighet alla svenska musikier en klass för sig själv!  Hälsningar Finland ! 👍
This video remaster is strikingly beautiful. I can only imagine what their more colourful videos will look like e.g The Big L, Fireworks,  Crash! Boom! Bang!, Almost Unreal, The Look and Dressed. Hope all their videos get the same treatment from Neverending Love and onwards. Then release them all on Blu Ray. I would buy it!
Super pozdrawiam Lubię Was ❤

Was für eine Großartige Band.
Bravo!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
nothing close to roxette.
This song is very beautiful, it's a shame that Marie Fredriksson died in such a sad way with a brain tumor.
AMO❤️ BRASIL💋2025.
Remaster is amazing she was so Beautiful, thank you!!
Linda música,alguém ouvindo em 09.10.2025?🇧🇷
belissima👋👋👋
The ability to remaster early 1990s video tape is unbelievable. Shot at 360p on magnetic tape and converted magnificently to 2k is incredible. Flim is easy as it's already a good quality, but tape is a different best. The work done here makes it look and feel like this video was recorded last week. Not 30 years ago, when I was listening to Roxette on the first CD I ever owned. Thank you for not only preserving this but making it something that will catch the eyes of todays generation inducing them to some of the great music off all time.
May God bless her for giving us the opportunity to hear that voice.
Recently became obbsessed with this amazing song after watching the VHS generation loss video from 16 years ago
Marye siempre estarás en nuestros corazones ❤ahora eres un bello ángel cantando en el reino de Dios 😢
Digging this - different footage, but crystal clear! 👍
A masterpiece, in 4k. Bravo! Amazing song.
👏
OUTSTANDING  MY FAVOURITE  OF THEM ALL ❤️ ♥️ 👏 💙 😍 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 👏 💙 😍 💜 ❤️ ♥️ 👏 💙 😍
I came from hipihopi but this Song is ssooo sooo good.❤
Beautiful song❤
When this album came out, I played it so much, that I wore out 2 tapes, 1 CD.
I haven't look or sound this good in many years
See that backdrop, that country...that is OVER. The UK is a complete trash bag now...thank God for the USA and FREEDOM.
🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️🎤👏
Diifferent ending
ROXETTE ILOVE 35 YEARS 😍😍😍
Geeze..voice awesome..her hair..”Perfect!! I wish I had her hair.. and I’m a strait guy. Her hair was hotter than Elvis! Who comes into 2nd place of best hair in the last 100 years, or ever… Young Elvis’s hair was amazing…and the fact that it was blonde and he died it “jet” black was crazy. 3rd best hair to her would be Dolph Lundgren in Rocky 4. Rosette was ahead of her time. She was awesome! Rip! (I had no idea that I would be chatting about the coolest hairstyles of all time.)
A masterpiece. 🔥❤🤩💯
Marie was a creature of light ❤️ Now she lives in it!
This vocalist, too good
Absolutely love that woman!  Great voice!
Mawla te ho.. Honda bike khalh ila.. T Ropianga fapa te ang.. A lo zo lo ve ngawt pek ang chu.. An han mawl chhah zia

In a time Where the sun descends alone I ran a long, long way from home To find a heart that's made of stone I will try I just need a little time To get your face right out of my mind To see the world through different eyes Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away But when we meet, it seems I can't let go Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower Tell me why When I scream, there's no reply When I reach out, there's nothing to find When I sleep, I break down and cry (cry), yeah Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away But when we meet, it seems I can't let go (can't let go) Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower Fading like a rose Fading like a rose Beaten by the storm Talking to myself Getting washed by the rain It's such a cold, cold town Oh, it's such a cold town Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away But when we meet, it seems I can't let go Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away But when we meet, it seems I can't let go Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a- Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away But when we meet, it seems I can't let go Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower Every time you leave the room (I feel I'm fading like a flower) Every time I see you (Fading like a rose) Every time you leave the room (Every time I see you) Every time I see you
❤

Que recuerdos de los años 90's,  INOLVIDABLES TODOS SUS ÉXITOS, QUE ÉPOCA
Tenho  57anos de idade.   Graças  a Deus,   sou  um  dos  privilegiados  por  ter  vivenciado  a  época  de  ouro   da   arte universal.    Sem  dúvida,   nós  dessa  faixa etária realmente,  fomos  muito  felizes.
OMG! Just perfect! ❤
Espetacular, R.I.P. Marie Fredriksson.😭
Thank you so much Roxette... thxs

Wow, such a beautiful remaster! Absolutely love Roxette; I will certainly miss Marie and her incredible vocals!
I discovered MUSIC with Roxette when I was a little boy in the late 80s, now I listen mostly to brutal metal and hardcore, but Roxette are always in my heart. 😘😘😘😘
Seems like an Abba song
Per and Marie ... in HD ... lovely!
1:00 esa mirada dios..

I love it.
18 /sep/2025❤❤😢
Sounds so fresh, still  does not seem possible she has gone, even after all these years, great musicians never truly die❤❤❤❤
Excellent remastering job. It looks like they changed some shots from the original 1991 video, but this one looks excellent.
Life is not a song. Life is not a film.
👍🏾😀🤔👀🎸🎙️🇧🇷📱🎧🎶▶️🤔😀👍🏾
Marie ❤
Absolutely stunning 🩷
I've always loved your music and I will continue to love it.
This music video is forever associated in my mind with a creepy video about VHS generational degradation.
Miss you Marie
great talented group..
I'm more of a hard rock and metal fan, but a girlfriend from my youth in the late 80s introduced me to Roxette and I've been listening to them ever since.
Oh, dear Roxette!  You’ve been my greatest musical love since my teenage years. From the very first note of The Look, I fell for you so deeply that I had to have every single one of your records, CDs, vinyls, cassettes (oh, those endless cassettes!). I never missed a single concert you played in our beloved Prague.  Your songs have been with me through it all: the happiest moments, the heartbreaks, and even during the hardest times of my chemotherapy.   And when Marie passed away, it felt like losing someone from my own family. I’m deeply grateful that you keep playing on, that your music lives, because it truly helps. It has become a part of my DNA.  Thank you for everything.
This is Roxette's beautiful, powerful emotion song. 💝
I do
Sweden should not accept such a huge number of refugees.
Impresionante , amazing!
Wonderful work, congrats to all involved and hoping there are more tapes available in the vaults. Can we get now at least 720p of the original video? The version uploaded 16 years ago is just 360p...
❤It was my dream to see this clip in good quality. Thank you.
Назавжди вічні
Roxette forever 🤩🤩🤩
She really is one of the best in my opinion ❤
The video is recorded where the Nobel banquet is held.
cool song
❤❤❤
Wow blast from the past!! ❤❤❤
Gracias por subirlo remasterizado, muy buena calidad, es 2025 y esta cancion permanece en mi setlist.
Can you do the same with the others videos please??? Listen to your heart, its must been love...
❤
AGUANTE ROXETTE , TODA MI ADOLESCENCIA ESCUCHE SUS TEMAS, DESDE CORRIENTES ARGENTINA
maravilha......!
2025???????????
Quedo perfecto!!!
I really love this music ❤
Love Roxette  for ever
In a time where the Sun descends alone Em uma época na qual o sol se põe solitário  I ran a long, long way from home Eu percorri um longo, longo caminho para longe de casa  To find a heart that's made of stone Para encontrar um coração que é feito de pedra  I will try, I just need a little time Eu tentarei, só preciso de um pouco de tempo  To get your face right out of my mind Para tirar seu rosto da minha mente  To see the world through different eyes Para ver o mundo através de olhos diferentes  Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away Toda vez que eu te vejo, oh, eu tento me esconder  But, when we meet, it seems I can't let go Mas quando nos encontramos, parece que não consigo deixar para lá  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  I feel I'm fading like a flower Eu sinto que estou murchando como uma flor  Tell me why Me diga por quê  When I scream, there's no reply Quando eu grito, não há resposta  When I reach out, there's nothing to find Quando eu procuro, não há nada para encontrar  When I sleep, I break down and cry (cry, yeah) Quando eu durmo, eu desabo e choro  Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away Toda vez que eu te vejo, oh, eu tento me esconder  But, when we meet, it seems I can't let go (can't let go) Mas quando nos encontramos, parece que não consigo deixar para lá (não consigo deixar para lá)  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  I feel I'm fading like a flower Eu sinto que estou murchando como uma flor  Fading like a rose Murchando como uma rosa  Fading like a rose Murchando como uma rosa  Beaten by the storm Derrotada pela tempestade  Talking to myself Falando comigo mesma  Getting washed by the rain Sendo lavada pela chuva  It's such a cold, cold town É uma cidade tão, tão fria  It's such a cold town É uma cidade tão fria  Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away Toda vez que eu te vejo, oh, eu tento me esconder  But, when we meet, it seems I can't let go Mas quando nos encontramos, parece que não consigo deixar para lá  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  I feel I'm fading like a flower Eu sinto que estou murchando como uma flor  Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away Toda vez que eu te vejo, oh, eu tento me esconder  But, when we meet, it seems I can't let go (can't let go) Mas quando nos encontramos, parece que não consigo deixar para lá (não consigo deixar para lá)  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  I feel I'm fading like a Eu sinto que estou murchando como uma flor  Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away Toda vez que eu te vejo, oh, eu tento me esconder  But, when we meet, it seems I can't let go (can't let go) Mas quando nos encontramos, parece que não consigo deixar para lá (não consigo deixar para lá)  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  I feel I'm fading like a flower Eu sinto que estou murchando como uma flor  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  I feel I'm fading like a flower Eu sinto que estou murchando como uma flor  Every time I see you Toda vez que eu te vejo  I'm fading like a rose Eu estou murchando como uma rosa  Every time you leave the room Toda vez que você deixa o ambiente  Every time I see you (every time I see you) Toda vez que eu te vejo (toda vez que eu te vejo)
Poucas harmonias são tão perfeitas quanto essa.

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
RIP Marie Fredriksson
Came cross this song had check it out
Marie tinha presença, sentimento, envolvimento com a letra da música, uma voz incomparável, presença de palco, enfim, era única. Per & Lena, continuem esta trajetória, continuem fazendo história agora na parte 2.
Boa
They changed quite a few scenes . It’s like a new video almost 😮❤
al fin con el volumen adecuado, no como la versión anterior
20-09-2025  I LOVE ALL YOURS SONGS!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤BRASIL 🥰 😍 🥰 😍 🥰

Amazing!!! There is an great cover by  Amaranthe!!
Que remaster lindo!!!!
2025 pte
Notice the small difference compared to the original clip at 3:20 : in the original, Per and an other old man walks by in the shadow, but now, a little boy shows up. I like it, it's a nice change. Like an easter egg. 😊
Good times with the group of guys 😮😅😅😅
Great classic!! ✨️✨️
Roxette forever ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damn it looks so good.
It was one of the first songs I learned to play on the piano. :-) Still beautiful... Loved Roxette in my youth and still do.  The day Marie died was one of the saddest of the last years for me, it really hit me unexpectedly hard considering she was a celebrity, a stranger to me. And I know what loss means, way too much. It felt as if a warm part of me, my youth, died.
Whoever wasn’t alive or born in the 80s and the 90s I feel bad for you
Uma canção tão bonita quanto triste. As flores murcham e levam com elas a beleza dos campos.
Much better than the previous official version... Why did it take you decades to remaster this beauty?
❤
An amazing performance. Thank you.
the older I get the more I appreciate them
No puedo ver ni escuchar esto Dios , me duele el alma, realmente me duele mucho, esta siempre será la canción favorita de mi vida. Me siento fatal
One word: STUNNING! Thank you, Roxette, for this.
Pop magic. 🎉
😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤
Varje gång jag lyssnar på detta låten jag saknar Stockholm

We miss you Marie
Só quem viveu sabe.. Best regards from Sao Paulo, Brazil
I've lost count of how many times I've watched this music video over the years.  This remastered version is really great, but some parts were changed in comparison with the original.  What caught my attention the most was the change made to the scene at 3:19. In the original video, I felt the scene was a reference to the song's title.  I personally wish they had kept the original final few seconds with those beautiful aerial shots of the Stockholm City Hall area at dusk. I have this strong desire to visit Stockholm one day because of those shots.
C'est une merveilleuse musique de film, elle est Superbe et je l'aime beaucoup. C'est ma préférée. Merci pour cette somptueuse musique Maestro ❤️❤️❤️🎻❤️❤️❤️
Recuerdos de juventud.
Very talented, sounds great.
Habe Sie damals 2x Live gesehen ! Marie war einmalig 😍 R.I.P

We will always love you Marie - !! Rock on in Heaven !!

WOW WOW WOW!! IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR NOW! ❤   I noticed Pelle has more screen time in this version 🎉  The climax of the song when Marie sings COLD COLD TOWN, the rose is supposed to be smashed at the word "TOWN" but this version missed it. 😢
👍👍👍
This song brings back so many memories from high school, like dancing with friends on weekends. Greetings from Arg. 👌AR.

Thank You! Finally a good copy.
Fantastic remaster of a classic 90's rock ballad. During that period NO ONE produced better rock ballads than Roxette. How about remastering the lot?
I still miss her voice. RIP.
Great
Ótima cantora, Marie, sempre amarei seu jeito de cantar, você se tornou eterna pra todos nós Brasileiros 😢

Everybody loves Roxette here in PNG.   👍🇵🇬
Roxette are timeless! ❤
❤❤❤
First time in a long time since I've been thrilled with a "new" Roxette release. Amazing! Love the close shots towards Per's guitar and Marie's side shot looking at the horizon. Though, I would like them to have kept "the lady of the lake" transition and the Per - Boy - old man one. By the way: OMG Per Alsing, I used to have a crush on him. Thumbs up those who were shook with his extra scenes as well.
Please don't let autosubtitles run on this piece of art. Love you Roxette.

The entire band looks incredible; it’s like watching this video again for the first time. Now where’s the remastered version of The Look that we desperately need?
I hope It must have been love is the next one to be remastered
Amazing work! Still love Roxette, your music never gets old. Thanks a lot!
I'm stunned and blushed, Marie owns the Joyride album, like it so good!!! 😄💛
Loved her music since my pre teen years! Funny how every song I ever loved has a specific spot in my current adult life! 🥀❤😍🏳️❣️🫶🏼

Thank You for this awesome remaster. Hoping more will come. Greetings from Norway 🇧🇻❤🇸🇪

Roxette was the best. And Marie as holy Mary. God bless her soul. Sweden rules. ;):)
que de souvenir j'aime beaucoups 🥰 gisele montreal,canada
THANKS
Great job! Please rekame THE LOOK!
Wow, I didn't think it would be this  AMAZING !! 🥰 Always loved this song, and I think we all LOVE seeing Marie this clearly from this era 🤩 It is so rare. Hoping for more remasters, so far they've done a great job on the others 👏❣
Que bueno ver remasterizados reales, no videos reescalados del master viejo que quedan horribles, parece todo de cera en esos falsos remasterizados, por el poco detalle de la imagen. Un remasterizado real se hace haciendo un nuevo transfer de los rollos fílmicos salidos de las cámaras, osea las tomas originales en crudo, se las trasnfiere a 4K, se vuelve a editar el videoclip con cada toma, como estaba en el primer master que se hizo y asi se reconstruye y que queda impecable, podes ver la imagen con calidad y mucho detalle como si fuera un video nuevo.
Ela voltou do céu, pra cantar pra a gente outra vez 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
amazing...this girl...❤
The video quality is insane
🫶🏻
Gracias, me encantó como suena la guitarra en el minuto 3:13 ❤😊
Absolutely brilliant!!!!! Feels like brand new again ❤❤❤❤
ONE OF MOST BEAUTIFUL SONGS OF BEAUTIFUL MARIE R.I.P.😢😢😢. ALWAYS ROXXETE.
Jest Piękno Które Przekracza Czas Granice i Trwa ! Piękno Utworu Muzyki i Zostaje Na Zawsze z Nami Jak Miłość i Pamięć 💖

So many memories!! I feel like I'm 16 again!! ❤❤❤ quite a few new scenes and missing a few others, like Per walking in time, replaced by a young boy!  Anyway, absolutely love this video (and song), back then and now!! 🎉🎉🎉❤

Roxette was the first pop music act that I was really a fan of, back when I was sixteen. I don't have any friends now from that long ago. No old school friends, and I went no contact with my parents and siblings a long time ago. The longest-lasting friend I have now is from when I was nineteen. Roxette is all there is left of the few moments of my childhood and teens that were actually good. I wish I had anyone in my life now who remembered me back then. But the music is still just as good now. Teenage me had good taste. I wish I could go back in time and see Roxette in concert again.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Lagi ketika semuanya terasa gimana ....❤😍
I hope Dangerous and Sleeping in my car will also be Remastered
BRAZIL LOVES YOU ROXETTE, YOULL BE WITH ME UNTIL I DIE!
Roxette ROX!!!
Thank you
crystal & clear
Sometimes even if they are old some clips have the magic of the time they were produced. But high quality music and images are also very enjoyable
Nice to see this updated. I noticed a few (only a second long) where you've had to edit it but otherwise it is an updated version of the original. Unlike Joyride which had about 20 seconds of edits. It was nice to see MF and PA brought back to life. :-)
We miss you Marie.
Love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Roxette. Please..please...remastered all video..
Incredible singer. I miss her.
I believed for a moment that Marie was still with us... beautiful remaster, congratulations.
Roxete и ABBA продолжают приносить в наш мир свет и радость. Спасибо, Швеция.
Marie ❤
Вона надихає!❤❤❤🇺🇦
This is truly a masterpiece of a song. 💯
My Heart
The beauty of the lyrics and the beauty of stockholm combined with the sheer beauty of Marie vocals equals one thing a beautiful masterpiece that can never ever be forgotten or replaced by anyone else ever
Please remastered vulnerable, it must have been love, dangerous, Queen of rain, and dress for success! 😍😍😍😍
Thank you very much, this is a very beautiful performance ! 💖🦁💖
Yaaasssss another remastered MV from ROXETTTEEEEEE 😍😍😍😍😍
It's my favorite Roxette song.  I always sing it at the top of my lungs. I Love
Excellent quality! 🤩 It was fun spotting all the editing differences to the original video and how many alternative takes of varoius shots have been used.
An absolute legend, there will never be another quite like Marie Fredrikkson. R.I.P. You will always be missed.
This feels like a gift from heaven.
Wow!! Thanks for this remastered classic. Love Roxette!!! ❤
I still love you Marie. Rest in peace in heaven.

There’s something timeless about this song, it captures the fragility of love and life so perfectly. Just like a flower, beautiful moments can fade, but the memory of them lingers forever. Roxette had a way of turning heartbreak into poetry. ❤

Per Gessle is an absolute genius for writing songs like this 🎸 And Marie is by far one of the most incredible singers to ever do it 🎤 (And we mustn't forget about the amazing band! 🎶) I'm feeling blessed to be watching & listening to this shining, standout moment of musical greatness! 🌟
Missing Marie. Her legacy will be eternal.
Extra
Super jakby to było wczoraj Estera😍👍👍

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉love Roxette 4ever❤
Marie! The Goddess! Miss you so much. One of my favorite songs from Roxette
1:27 A spectecular view from Stockholm City Hall! That video is one of my dearest youth memories. Thank you for remastering it! Sleep heavenly, Marie. 💚
A true power ballad, as fresh as it was first released yesterday. Great music like this, I’m afraid, will never be made again.
Now this is how you properly restore a music video shot on film! Looks brilliant and the song has been amazing for decades!
Genial!
Gracias por este vídeo,no imagina lo que Rosette representa para mí, en 3:43 minutos pasó tanta vida delante de mis ojos. . . Beso al cielo para Marie. Abrazo a Roxette. Desde Argentina ❤🇦🇷
Marie ♥
The sound production, those musicians, the video, and that voice… perfection ❤️
Myslím, že Švédsko má dva národní poklady. Skupinu ABBA a skupinu ROXETTE!
When the Music was Music, another masterpiece by Roxette, the best pop/rock band ever.
INCREDIBLE! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
❤
BANGER!!!❤❤
Прекрасная песня и музыка. Прекрасно сделанный клип. Отличная работа. ❤
at the 3:19 mark what happened to the boy becoming a old man like in the original?
The best Roxette song ever. A perfect rock ballad with Marie's unique voice. And a fantastic videoclip about Stockholm
Finally in HD! And I love the fact that it is almost a new video, full of different takes! ❤
Looks amazing! It's a shame some of the old footage is missing though, but interesting to see new parts.
genial !
ooooooo HD ooooo heaven
Wooooow.❤
Se extraña a Marie :(
At the highest quality settings it feels like this video has been restored to television quality back in the day.
Ahhh!  One of my favorite Roxette videos!  ❤👍
The Best!
I remember in 1992, I was 12 years old, the first time I heard this song was when I watched the video. It was on the english school, there were "music classes" when the teacher chose the videoclip of 2 songs to translate with the students. When the teacher played this videoclip, I thought "man, this song is soooo awesome!". Then I started asking all my friends if they had Roxette albums, but nobody had Joyride yet and the record store on my small town, in Brazil, also didn't have it in store. It took some months until I found one friend who had just bought it and he recorded a K7 for me. After listening to "Fading Like a Flower" hundreds of times, I realised that Joyride was one of the best albums I knew, with so many fantastic songs. "Spending My Time", "Do You Get Excited" and "Things Will Never Be The Same", with a fantastic combination of keyboards and heavy guitars, and the incredibly beautiful "Perfect Day" marked my brain forever. This album, together with Look Sharp, Tourism and the songs "Almost Unreal" and "It Must Have Been Love", have made me an enthusiastic Roxette fan and, until today, I have a strong affective memory with then. I fortunately had the chance of seeing Roxette live back in 2011 on their comeback tour. It was very emotional!
ICONIC
CLASSIC
2:42 so nice 😎
Wow 🤩😍
Amazing quality and never-before-seen footage! Love it so much! And looking forward to more restored Roxette videos! ❤
Love it❤
What a beautiful job!!! Just like with the previous two videos. I know one day they’ll do the same with ‘Listen to Your Heart.’ I’ll always say she was the most beautiful woman and, of course, my favorite band!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing picture quality <3 but this is not just restoration, this is a new edit, that unfortunately i feel its not that powerful :( i miss the old edit, it was cut to perfection
The quality of this version of fading like a flower 🌹 and the audio is pure perfection RIP Marie thank you for the amazing memories and music Roxette is still going on strong but no one can ever replace Marie.
Por favor! ¿Cómo crear un clásico? Una pregunta que siempre se la quise hacer a Per. ¿Cómo hace que una canción siga vigente y siga sonando fresca 35 años después? Completamente atemporal, generándome las mismas sensaciones que cuando la escuché por primera vez, a los 13 años, allá por 1991. Gracias Per! Gracias Roxette!
Me invade una gran nostalgia, no puedo evitar emocionarme al ver este video, Roxette l uno de mis grupos favoritos desdé mi adolescencia, ver a Marie tan hermosa, aún se extraña a pesar de los años qué han pasado desde su muerte❤🌻🌹😢
Did they used AI?🤯 seems she still alive 🥲
this is a time machine
🎉
Maybe the definitive AOR song? I was literally watching the previous video the last few days wondering when would we get a remaster, and here it is, looking and sounding completely radiant.
Thank you very much! It's almost a new video, with scenes never seen before! ☺️
The restoration of the "Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)" video by Roxette is truly amazing! It's impressive how the visual quality feels so modern, almost like it was filmed in 2025. The vibrant colors and sharp details bring new life to the song, allowing fans to experience that era with a fresh perspective.  The original production was already beautiful, but now, with this contemporary touch, you can feel the emotion of the song even more. Roxette always had a special magic, and this restored video only reaffirms their legacy in pop music. It's definitely worth a watch! 🎶✨
O restauro do clipe "Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)" da banda Roxette realmente ficou sensacional! É impressionante como a qualidade visual está tão moderna, quase como se tivesse sido filmado em 2025. As cores vibrantes e os detalhes nítidos trazem uma nova vida à música, permitindo que os fãs revivam essa época com uma nova perspectiva.   A produção original já era linda, mas agora, com esse toque contemporâneo, dá para sentir ainda mais a emoção da canção. Roxette sempre teve uma magia especial, e esse clipe restaurado só reafirma o legado deles na música pop. Vale a pena conferir! 🎶✨
SUPER ❤👏👏👏
espectacular remasterizacion   felicitaciones mas videos asi
What a great and sweet surprise to see this remastered version of this song today. I had 15 years old when I saw this video at the first time back in 1991. Gos bless you Marie Fredriksson.
What a great video, Per!  This was allready one of my favorites,  and this remastered version is so wonderful. Marie in full action,  like she's still with us ...( omg how i wished she was)...love the alternative shots with Per & Jonas...well done😊
Hello for my youth again! Hello for my best days lived freely ever! Hello for my teenagerity again! Helloes for the nineties!
They were so awsome
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thaqnk you for restoring this GEM! I miss Marie even more now...
A perfect band, forever😊
I recognize Gamla Stan and City Hall. Where is the golden room?  This video really made me miss Marie this morning. Tack Roxette!!
Increíble. Guardaron las cintas originales sin las cuales no podría haberse hecho ésto. Ojalá hayan guardado más y puedan remasterizar más material.
👍💕💕💕💕💕💕
It looks fantastic. Marie knew how to deliver a song, both with her voice and with her body. She was unique and irreplaceable just like Madonna or Marilyn Monroe and other few ones.
Que saudade <3
OMG!! it is just perfect!!!😍
👌👌👌
My Favorite Roxette song ❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you for bringing them back
Wonderfoul!! ❤
Truly a masterpiece that deserves only the best work of remaster, and here It comes! 😉🫵♥️♥️♥️
Yes this was realy good quality
Filmed in Stockholm City Hall and the Old Town.
💖😎👍💖😎🎸👍💖🌹🎶📼👍
There is no one like Marie Fredriksson. R.I.P.
WoaA!!
Gorgeous! Now the visuals match the genius of the song
We miss you Marie! ❤
Marie consegue nós levar de volta no tempo com sua voz e beleza e estilo uniico.  Ouvir suas músicas e incrível Marie será sempre Eterna .
Roxette For Ever!!!
Listen ro the 16 year old video and compare it with this edition. I'll take the older version.  Why ruin what is great.
Wow, magnificent guys, love this song and Roxette, both Marie and Per are and were phenomenal ❤❤❤ from Ireland 😊😊
For more videos like this! No words.
I guess this should be labeled as "Remastered 2025 alternative cut"
Yey... 4k video 🎉❤❤
This is a wonderful surprise that I wasn't expecting. I'm really loving it
Timeless....
Aaahhh...the music video that made me want to visit Stockholm in an instant. The perfect tourism ad, all because of Roxette. This video certainly brings back a lot of good memories...at a time when life was a lot simpler (and more enjoyable).  There's some different cuts in this video edit and I probably prefer the original edit more but I still love this song and video just as if I were seeing it for the first time. So thank you, Per and the Roxette team, for bringing this back to crystal clarity life. And a bonus is that it's always good to see Marie again. ❤
A true masterpiece. I love it!
One of my favourites! ❤
El amor verdadero es tan solo el primero. Gracias Roxette!
I love you, Per & Marie. ❤
😍😍😍
Wow, new shots of Marie, how wonderful that is. I wish we had both versions in HD, as the first one flows better, but how fantastic is to have this new update. The next one: You DOn't Understand me in colour!!
Roxette大好きです
WOW! What a difference. Marie - still so much missed.
Awesome! Looks like recorded yesterday, what a magic 😍 Roxette Forever!
Beautiful images thats true, but what's with the edits? For example when Marie starts to sing, she's not in scene, some lip synchronization are wrong, the climax, the rose smashing in the ground is off synch too. Not all the newer stuff are better 😢
Ooooh, I hope we're getting a DVD/BluRay with all the videos remastered :)
I will love Roxette💕 Roxette is forever! Marie is my eternal idol!
Marie at her best ❤
Please mention " ROXETTE " in the songtitle!
Maravillosa Marie❤
Amazing
Simply one of the best.....

It’s like bringing Marie from heaven for a little while and being able to enjoy her endless beautiness and talent. Wow .
The Best music is from the 80s and 90s ❤
Bravo! Bravo!, Estupendo trabajo de REMASTERIZADO, incluyendo escenas nuevas, este con Spending My Time & Joyride son los tres trabajos de remasterización perfecta, Listen to your Heart su remasterd les quedó pésimo quizás por ya no tener el máster de vídeo, pero parece que Per o EMI  aún conservan los Master de vídeo.
Marie Fredriksson(RIP) & Per Gessle... Unforgettable...
RiP Marie (*) 0:37...Loves From Poland...
