This is so awesome! I watch it over and over because it makes me smile from ear to ear! Pleeease consider selling collectable dolls of your characters- I want them all! I absolutely love all that Lane Johnson, Jason Kelce, Jordan Mailata and everyone who was involved with this project is doing for their community! Wishing you and your families many blessings in 2024 and beyond! 🙏♥

so cute 🥹 amazing ❤
Merry Christmas everyone except you Dallas!!!
I absolutely loved this! Thank you for this amazing show. ❤
I’m a Chiefs  fan but the Eagles have stolen my heart!!!❤️
Y'all are fantastic!! Definitely enjoyed it, and im a Packers fan!!
Bringing joy to the World 🌎
This why we fuxking suck. They supposed to be warriors but out here fucking singing
Way Funny! 😂
Amazing duet Kelce boys!! Nice job to everyone involved in making this animated Christmas program!  Oscar award???
Lol I liked this way more than I expected to!!! #GoBirds
Why an awesome bunch of guys. Really enjoyed it.
I love the utubes of them practicing. Made me laugh and feel joy.
Next year please close caption….
Pretty darn good.  Well done guys!  Merry Christmas everyone!!
For the trilogy, I had an idea that they should do “Christmas Truce” from Sabaton and have it sung with members on the Dallas Cowboys. The whole song is about the Christmas Truce of 1914, when in World War 1, men from both sides laid down their weapons and shook hands in no man’s land. So having the Eagles and Cowboys have a truce just for one song, I feel, would be epic.
Hey Jason what about new Braunfel
This is hilarious !!!
All you do is repeat the same over and over, you know nothing!
This was the best ever, I'm going to see if I can buy this cartoon. My family would love it.  You have to know I'm not a Philly fan, but I am a Kelce fan. Thanks, Taylor.
Merry Christmas to you all from Tennessee
Got to love it
Question what is citywide specials? I would assume it is a cocktail and after ones you wouldnt know what your name is. Not from philly just want to have more context to laugh at this magnificent piece of art.
Good wholesome Christmas cheer! Love the Kelsey Brothers and their love for each other, football and everyone else! They were raised by some good folks! ❤❤❤Merry Christmas to your family! My son is an up and coming Walk On… so I respect the process and how you guys good naturedly share your lives.  Thank you! 🙏🏻
Ooh! 🎄🎄much love to everyone!
Needs more eyebrow!
Love it!  ❤
I really loved it and so did my granddaughters! Merry Christmas to everyone!
“Except you Dallas” SENT ME LOL
This is so cute
I can not get enough of this--Sharing with everyone, but PLEASE make more!!! Absolutely love and respect all of you for your talent, creativity, and courage--don't ever stop having such big hearts!
Too cute!
I have very little family around where I live, but this made me feel right at home, with everyone, made me feel at home in VA when I was a kid with everyone,thank you.for making me smile once again ❤️🌹 ❤
I laughed so hard when Jordan shoved Travis at the last part😂😂😂
I LOVE it. Great job!!
Now all we need is one superbowl win  hopefully this year
St Vick needs a cameo
As a cowboys fan, I hope the grinch steals all y’all’s presents, but fr Merry Christmas from Dallas
"This is alarmingly good!" :)  Thanks for a fun, sweet show.
Awesome❤
Pretty Paper sung by Lane Johnson is my favorite song this Christmas.  He is FABULOUS!
Yup! Yay!!!
This Bears fan says Fly Eagles Fly when it comes to this video and how much this projects has raised money for important charities!
Love you guys! Merry Crimmus 🫶🏻
Now, them is MY Boys❤❤❤❤
Being and Eagles fan if that doesn’t put a smile on your face don’t know what will…Those 3 guys will “always” have a special place in my heart …Bleed Green
how can everyone hate us so much with gems like these???? go birds!
Jason, if you watch the move "Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, and look for the character "Yukon Cornelius"!  I swear it was your voice!!  You may have a career in voice overs!! Just saying!
Merry Christmas Everyone! Except you, Dallas!!🎄🎅🏽🤶❄️☃️❤🦅❤ 🦅❤️
I just found your channel 💚 I lost my sister 7yrs ago, she loved the Philadelphia Eagles, she had the sneakers, jersey, all Eagles. That year she passed before they won The Superbowl. 💚Fly Eagles Fly 💚🎶🎶🎶
Just very Philly Special!!!
This is great, love it✌❤🎄
Jordan mailata can hit them notes
I am not a big NFL football fan but became a Philly fan last year after hearing the Philly Special Christmas Album
Probably best NFL animated special. We need to see more of this from NFL Teams 🤣😆
I just received 2022 and 2023 A Philly Special Christmas Special (and the jigsaw puzzle) and I have to tell you IT IS AWESOME!!!!! I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy that I got it. Brings miles of smiles on my face!! Thank you EVERYONE!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚

Can Travis not get involved with literally everything?
AWESOMENESS!!!!
I love this so good 😊🌲
The absolute best . Thank you guys so much for this !!!!
I could not help but think what a glorious gift it was to include the Kelce girls. When I was a kid I loved Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer but to have your Dad star in this and include you, was beautiful!
👍💚🎅👏🤗🏈💚🔔😍  Happy Holidays to our Eagles organization and their families. Thank you for all you do for the fans and the City of Philly❗
This was amazing I loved it. It should be longer next year.❤
Loved it! (Except you Dallas haha) But why was Nick Foles not listed in the credits?
Awesome 👏 🎄
I am a die-hard Dallas  fan, but love Jason and this Christmas special.
Jason=Yukon Cornelius (sorry if this was already posted, i musta missed it)
Santa’s Night has become my favorite Xmas song of all time. Beautiful song with such a story.
Jason Kelce has the biggest ole bear heart of them all.

I loved every second of this
Love this!!!
Lane has a very nice voice.
OMG! I love this, and I’m a Chiefs fan. MERRY CHRISTMAS to all of you.
Love it
👍👍👍👍👍
This reminds me of  Christmas Eve coming home from church & watching Christmas movies with my family esp with my Dad. He passed Dec of 22. Ty for bringing back good memories.
No words for this Man! His LOVE for his Family, Teammates & Philly is what drives him. What more could you ask for? He is the TOTAL PACKAGE!!!
Pretty Paper was PHENOMENAL!!!!
I wanna see Lil Dicky get a scene!
I love this so much. GO BIRDS.
"Except dallas" lmfao😂😂😂
Niners fan. Im almost sorry what we did to yall after watching this. That was truly fantastic !
Next time I go to Ray's I'll make sure to bring my pet donkey!

This was AWESOME!!!!  I love it!  Y’all can sing!!!
49ERS RAN YO SHIT LMAO YALL PATHETIC

The last line...now that's Philly! 💚🦅💚
This is truly a classic! Yes, this is what all Eagle fans and friends will be expecting another one next year! I think I’ve got a new tradition! Yep! Merry Christmas to all!🎄🎄🎄
Thank you! In a time with so much chaos in the world, I guarantee these guys will put a smile on your face. 🙂
That was beautiful. Best thing since the Super Bowl shuffle. Lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They look like peanuts!
Love this soooooo much ❤
Except you Dallas 😂😂😂
This is so awesome. You guys have a fan for life. It’s so heartwarming to see wholesome content these days. I’m not much older than you guys and this made me feel like a kid again. Embarrassed to say it but I actually cried. Feeling all the feelings right now. The world needs more men like you. Amazing role models. Thank You for being You!
SOOOOOOO AWESOME❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
music and song may save this world.
And this is why the Eagles are the best!! And love my Philadelphia ❤
That was so refreshing to wake up to on this dreary Saturday morning!🥰 Thank you guys! Keep the hits (on the field and in the studio) coming!!!🔥🏈🎼
The St. Nick appearance 😂😂
This was so great. Merry xmas
I'm a packer fan but respect to these guys for making Christmas even more special for everyone
thank u stee..eaglles country!!!
I’m surprised this isn’t on the eagles channel. Fly Eagles Fly 🦅
OMG, this is so awesome.
This is impressive
These guys made me a fan of Philadelphia Eagles.  And that's saying something considering, I used to be a Cowboys fan.  But no more.  Now, its E-A-G-L-E-S!!
So glad for them to €a$h in on their fame!!
Love & Enjoyed Viewing This Awesome 2023 Christmas Video ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
As a cowboys fan, that “except you dallas” hurt lol but still good
Wow! Lane and Jordan have amazing voices! Who knew. Have a ton of love for Jason and the eagles. . Jason is my favorite player not in a chiefs uniform. Go CHIEFS!
Amazing! #holidayclassic
Long suffering Falcons fan, but happily a 92%er and Kelce fan.  Love this special and the songs on the album are awesome! It is wonderful how you are raising money for charity and making us all smile in the process.
NICK FOLES!😭😂😭😂
We need a feature length special!! This will be a new tradition for our family!
We loved this! (Teo and Filippa)
How about a Hanukkah song thrown into the mix
This is so, so good.  I've lost track of how many times I've watched it.
This is the Christmas special everyone needs right now
My only disappointment was that it’s under 8 minute video. I need a full length 60 minute movie!
My favorite Christmas song is fly. Eagles fly Christmas. For the fight song     of Kelly Green Christmas colors
Loved it!!
This was so good!!! Well done!!
This os awesome. Especially since they did all this work over the summer. BEFORE the popstar nonsense. Meery christmas to all (EXCEPT YOU DALLAS...AND FORTYWHINERS!!!)
Excellent, you guys are so talented 🦅💚
As a Chiefs fan, I can honestly say this is my new favorite Christmas special. I really spit my drink when he said, “Except you Dallas!” 😂😂😂
Go Birds!!! 🦅🦅🦅
The family has watched this 4x I love it
Loved this ♥♥!!! So creative & well done. Thank you to all these guys for the beautiful singing.   Merry Christmas & Go Birds 🎄🦅!!  The St. Nick cameo was great⭐
OBSESSED!!!!
Dallas I'm sorry 😂🎉
This was just beautiful 😢

As someone who lost there mom at 44 in 2021.  This makes me cry/laugh lol so badass I’m from Dallas die hard fan.. but I love what y’all did keep going this is really badass my mom would’ve loved it for sure 😢
I am from Philly but live in the Burg now but Jason Kelce is a 1 of a kind and a true Eagle a great husband, father and human
This is great!! Love it!
💜💜💜
Straight up the most wholesome thing I have ever seen ❤
I live in Texas, have been a cowboy fan since they started, BUT NO MORE I LOVE THE KELCE BOYS AND THE EAGLES/CHIEFS TEAMS! I AM 82 YRS OLD SO I CAN LOVE BOTH TEAMS. THANKS TO JASON AND TRAVIS FOR KEEPING A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE. LOVE TO ALL❤❤
did dallas dirty
God Bless Nick Foles
Wish everyone a special Christmas except you Dallas, LOL the best line ever!
loving it
I am a Houstonian, don't like Christmas music (retail trauma), all I know about Philly is cheesesteak sandwiches. But this got me in my feels 🥲. Merry Christmas y'all.
I'm glad that I am alive today, in this world, in this city to experience something so magical as the Philly Christmas Special!!!
This is amazing, shout out to City Wides!
I loved the except you Dallas 😂😂😂😂😂
This was awesome! I have to go watch last years!  Class act!
i love this 😂
I’m a Cowboys fan who has had a disdain for the Eagles. But this is adorable. And I’m conflicted in my feelings 😂 I love this so much!
That was so so good!! Amazing work!🎉
Love this…adorable! Go 🦅!🎄
This is F*ck!ng awesome.. I'm old enough to remember when Da Bears were cool like this....
Absolutely loved this. You guys are great! Great job!!

Adding this to the list of things I need to watch every year
This is the absolute BEST!!
Where cam I get album
Love it! Glad they included Travis and Jason’s girls! All the guys are such good singers. Happy Holidays!
We aren’t talking enough about Connor Barwin being a huge part of all this! 😂
This was great😊❤
Congratulations to the entire creative team, production, and performers on this masterpiece! I’m blown away, I’ve watched this a hundred times already. This is so fun and rewarding to watch as a native Philadelphian. What a fantastic short story to go with the music - the costume change tranformations for Lane, Jason, and Jordan were magic. Gotta buy the album now, put this in the hall of fame.
“I heard that,Travis!”  “The show is falling apaaart!”🤣🤣🤣
This is adorably too cute! The puppet stop motion animation is spectacular; some of the best quality I've ever seen. Very professionally done, kudos. I Iove this!
Except you Dallas 😂😂😂
This was so well made and so heartfelt. And even cooler seeing the parents of 2 of my students, Marie & Peter, at the end of the video. Great job you guys!
Love our Birds! Fly Eagles Fly!🦅
Being a cowboys fan, I laughed when Jordan said "except you Dallas." I may not the like the team, but I still like the players 😂😆
my favorite part was Jordan shoving Travis away at the end!! LOL #flyeaglesfly
Have no idea about anything Football but you guys are my new favorite everything ❤
Now we need a chiefs easter, patriots mothers day, stealers saint patricks day, and so on
Why am I crying!!?? Thank you special Philly peeps
Even as someone who hates the Eagles, I will know watch this every year, good job Philly Specials!
Watching this masterpiece in Jackson, South Carolina.  Even in the tiniest of small towns here in the South, I fly the green.  This is now annual viewing; heck, I'll probably watch it again this season!  From a South Jersey ex-pat in South Carolina,  GO BIRDS!
Outstanding work!! Plus Willie's Pretty Paper... the ballad of Frankie Brierton. In this crazy chaotic world, peace to you all.
St.Nick ❤
That was so cute and smazing. Merry Christmas to you all and Happy New Year!  This is for a worthy cause.
It was so cute ❤😊
So cute!
I’m not an Eagles fan but that was great! As a Ravens fan, I want to hate Travis for how much he rips us up but I just can’t. Dude is a great sport and you just can’t hate the Kelce brothers
Big D!
Absoulty  love it!
Amazing, thank you. ❤
Absolutely love it!!!
1:33 Christmas song  2:26 this Christmas  3:15 Dominic the donkey  4:08 pretty paper 🤷‍♂️ 5:41 and now the moment we’ve all been waiting for the fairytale of philidaphia  6:06 all I want for Christmas is you
Amazing
Like, Like, Like!!!
We in Europe dont know why for 2 years they greet everyone but Dallas. What is a joke?
This feels like a episode of always sunny
This is awesome! I’m a Bills fan but I like the Kelsey brothers and the guys from the Eagles! Well done!
Cameo by Foles and Mailata excepting Dallas made it perfect.  New holiday special forever
How has this only been seen by 28k? Awesome 🎉
Loved it. I am looking for the full Christmas movie now. EAGLES
The gang needs to make a half hour holiday special! This one was so cute and enjoyable. Took me back to my childhood in the 80s when I watched this style of animation Christmas specials on TV. Thank you for making this!!   Well done!!!!  GO BIRDS! ❤💚🦅💚❤
Hilarious! Jason and the donkey hit Ray's Happy Birthday bar for a "city-wide special"!! (can of Pabst + shot of Jack Daniels)
I busted out laughing at the "except you Dallas" 😂 I gotta know who was hitting those high notes at the end!?
Awesome job ,everyone seems like a great fit . You guys most definitely have a future beyond the NFL ! Happy Holidays!!
This is the greatest thing in NFL history.
What a fun adorable show!! Not to mention these guys can really sing!❤🎉
Hey don’t Nick Foles get a credit? Or was that someone doing Nicks voice?
A decades old Ravens fan here just loving those Eagles!!! Love the Kelce’s . Too much fun. Thanks for the music guys- way to bring fans together at Christmas!!🥳🥳🥰🥰🏈
Lanes awesome
WOW, thank you artists for this amazing nostalgic production!
Well I'm a fan!
Incredibly well done! This is awesome!
Okay this kind of reminds me of  Charlie Brown  the peanut show
This video was exactly what I needed to cheer me up this morning. I’ve shared it with my friends and family. I have no doubt that this short will be a new Holiday classic for all fans of Philly, the Iggles, Christmas, and anyone interested in sharing good times with friends and family. I have already decided that it will be a new holiday tradition of something I will watch at least once every holiday season. Thank you to all of the amazing artists who put this together - players, performers, and brilliant production team.
❤❤❤❤❤
This Giants fan is lovin’ this🎄🎶 #exceptdallas😜
I loved it but there's no way that Jason's girls are sitting that long in a sled. Wyatt and Elliotte are definitely running around.
jk king of South Philly!!!
Wait, they weren't moving on their own? 😮
Putting a smile and cheer on my face. Thanks
High quality.  I will be playing these often.
I literally screamed in delight when Nick Foles poofed in with his angelic call. Also Lane Johnson!! Deserves to perform at the Grand Old Oprey!!
This was excellent!!!
The only Philadelphia sports team I support!!
This is amazing! just made my night
let’s go travis! also the nick foles part was hilarious lol
@aphillyspecialchristmas @unpopanimation this is amazing.  As someone that grew up on the classic Christmas specials this one took me back especially with Merrill playing the role made famous by Burl.
Loved it ❤ Merry Christmas 🎄
Except for you dalice....🦅🦅🦅
This was so good! My personal fave is Dominic the Donkey!!
My heart ❤❤❤. Merry Christmas and go Birds!!
Oh, this is just what was missing! Carry on gentlemen, carry on. Love it!

Of Course I absolutely Loved It!! It was Awesome!! 💚🎄❤️🎁💚✝️❤
Adorable
This is adorable
I loved this!!
MOST. PHILLY. THING. EVER!!!!
Amazing! Jason’s voice is getting better and better, hilarious ending again💚💚

Love this! Happy Christmas to all in Philly and across the USA from the U.K.
Great show!! And that's coming from a Chiefs fan!!!
I want more! Bravo! These guys aren't bad singer's actually.  Sure their not ready for concert tours. That's what makes it so much more special for all ages. ❤ It's pure warm hearted Christmas holiday joy. Merry Christmas everyone.  ❤
Outstanding🎄❣️
So proud to be a Philadelphian and Birds fan. Ppl may hate us, but at least no other team has two successful Christmas albums and a short clamation film 💚🤍💚🤍🦅💯
Jason is right there with Reggie White. 🦅🦅
Exellente 👍❤🎉
❤
🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
This is the best. Made me smile, laugh and even cry. Absolutely the Best. Happiness all around
Can't stop laughing ! Only in Philly !
I loved it! Their singing voices are excellent.
Move over Rudolph!
This is amazing! The elbow to Travis, sooo funny!
This Green Bay girl gives a thumbs-up! 👍💚💛
Awesome! Thanks, Guys! You are really talented!
Nick was a nice surprise
❤️to Philly and the world from a cold  Sweden 🇸🇪
Oh my gosh, this is awesome! A classic! Loved every minute of it!!❤
I haven't watch football since the Washington red shin owner died and that new jury bought and ruined the team. The reason for saying that, Jason and Travis have peeked my interest.  Love those boys. Ma kelse did it right. From another 70 yo mother of girls
My kids love the show make episodes please 🙏 but love it great job guys
This is gonna be a part of my Christmas tradition ❤❤❤❤
lol except you Dallas😀
If Jason doesn't get an instant Eagles HOF induction ill never enjoy that city ever. 😅
Jordan pushing Travis out of the way is pure gold
Gotta love Connor Barwin “swooping in” to put out the fire (literally!) 😂😂 Great job, Merry Christmas, and GO BIRDS!!
I love this💚🦅💚🦅💚
Why can Jordon actually sing?!! I need to see him singing the next anthem at the game
I'M A DIEHARD South Jersey Eagles FAN! LOVED IT. OMG AWESOME! ESPECIALLY BRINGING FOLES BACK AND THE "EXCEPT YOU DALLAS" THEN PUSHING TRAVIS BACK! I WAS CTHU N SCREAMING! BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO TO DROP. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS. AWARD WINNING video! 🙌 🏆 😊😊
👍
49ers Fan, Phily, youve gained my respect. May the Football Rivalry live on , but let us all come together as one group for christmas!!
As one who was a child in the early 70s…I absolutely love this! 😂
Greatest Christmas Special EVER!
This is just too good!!!
Amazing job! Wish it was longer
I loved that Jason sang Dominic The Donkey. That was awesome!!! Great job guys!!! Merry Christmas 🎄🎅🏼
I loved it ❤❤ FLY EAGLES FLY
Love the stop motion! As a Philly based stop motion animator myself, I will be looking into UnPop for sure!
So funny.... best parts - Calling the donkey and Jason an ass, Travis NOT crying , Jordan Mailata, pushes Travis back and of course, Nick Foles sudden appearance.
This is so well done!  I absolutely 💯  love this.  It is so good.  These gentlemen  can sing for sure.  So excited to watch this.  Love these guys!!!  Happy holidays.
This is awesome. What a cute animated short. I love Jason!!!
Love this!! 🎄❤️🎄❤️
Fantastic!! Such a great way to add to this joyous time of year!
So this year we got Travis. Next year are we getting Tswift?
This is just awesome
Felix Navidad🌲🌲🌲🎄🎄🎀
I am sleeping please don't disturb 😂😂😂
Brilliant! Thank you ❤
Jason 😆🤌🏼💚
As a cowboys fan Happy Holidays NFL fans
I’m high and thought in the thumbnail the bald dude was bill burr and this was gonna be a cool animation of him destroying the shithole that Philly is.
Who knew that all we needed was Jordan Mailata singing all I want for christmas
As a Giants fan who hates Philly with all my guts, this is not what I wanted but what what I needed for the holidays.
loved it !!!!
LOVE it
It took me watching this for the 4th time at the end of Nov 10 weeks into the next season to finally say I'm over the super bowl loss. GO BIRDS
Jordan stealing the spotlight at 6:16 is sending me 😂
🌠 PERFECT! 🎄 🤔 where to give? 😇
"Except You Dallas" 😂
Jason has an extraordinary voice ~ amazing for film and voice overs. Would love to hear Travis sing a full song. Both are fabulous and bring smiles😊
Love the animation 🎉❤

Thank you,Boys! Love it!❤
huge appreciation to the artists who created the video !!!
It’s perfect.
@aphillyspecialchristmas ... This production was absolutely amazing... from the creation of the animation, to the storyline, to the flawless flow of the music, the special guest stars from Saint Nick to Patti Labelle to Travis and our very own voice of the Eagles... Merrill Reese... it is just the perfect start to the holiday season. Can't thank our Philly Specials enough for spreading joy to all... not just Philly Fans like myself.  Thanks Jason, Lane and Jordan and all for all you are doing! Signed, a HUGE fan and supporter! Keep it coming.
AWESOME from Farmington, Missouri
Congratulations on your successful hard work. I appreciate all of you guys helping us get the season right away. Jason and Travis, please be safe and Cheif and Eagles well wishes.
I love the old school feel. Claymation. The peanuts looking drawing on the cover. It’s perfect
❤❤❤
น่ารักกก😍
Swiftie here. This video was so amazingly well done! I feel like discovering Jason and his beautiful family and this rockin’ album has been such an unexpected and lovely addition to my holiday season. Thanks guys!
Amazing!!!!

This is amazing!!! Thank you Lane, Jordan and Jason 😊🎄💚🦅💚🎄🎅
The greatest thing since the SuperBowl 🏈 🎄 6:04
Not even a Philly fan but I absolutely love this!!! Jason is a true treasure. ❤❤❤
I wish I could see them arguing with each other
First the albums and now this sweet show!!!!   This Philly Special Christmas Show was such a wonderful treat.  I smiled throughout the entire show. (I cracked up at the end when Jordan pushed Travis out of the way of our 3 Philly Wisemen.  🤩🤩)
Not a Philly fan at all, but I really like this!!!!
I don't know who told these guys that the audio sounded good
Philly Special keeps getting more and more special!!
Where's the LOVE button! ... must have on Blu Ray; I agree @nightfoxx , part of the Christmas tradition now for sure!
This was awesome! Go birds and merry Christmas 🎄🎁 🦅💚
Shout out to Brazil
I love it! How could I be made into a cartoon character? I want to be shown waking up on game day and going through all of the shenanigans that eagle fans go through until the clock hits 0:00!
This is awesome! Much love from Germany! ❤
Claymation Jason hugging his three Claymation daughters in the sleigh, major heart tug!
Amazing work Pete! Go Birds 🦅
This is amazing, I hope this becomes a tradition. I watched this with my nephew and it reminds him of a mix of the claymation Rudolph and a Charlie Brown xmas.
Love it❣️🙌🏽
So funny! Such an incredible stop-motion production! Great job, all! Merry Christmas!
#GoBirds 🦅
This is definitely a new tradition! Now…guys I need ornaments, figurines, hell can we get a Philly nativity scene too?   The Eagles are the American team! Bringing families together..except you Dallas 😂

Lane singing "Pretty Paper" is my favorite part.
Love this! Except Dallas!
Great show by the greatest OL in the game, thanks for all you guys do on and off the field for Philadelphia you guys are awesome. Happy holidays to all of you and your families.
The Chestnut song was beautiful!
This was a real classic! Keep it up!
So awesome!
Make a Tv special
I really wish you guys would put this on Fox or NBC for everyone to watch during football 🏈 season 👏♥️ Fly Eagles Fly
Absolutely loved it. New Christmas Tradition for sure. The Kelce Family is a National Treasure.  Only thing missing was Mama Kelce in the box.
GO BIRDS!!!!!
❤
How could you not love Jason?
🔥🔥🔥
We love these guys in Philly. Always will.
Hahahaha Merry Christmas except for Dallas!!!
instant classic
Ok, move over Mariah, Hello Jordan!!! 😍😍 Aussie can sanggggg!!!
My dads sick at the hospital, I showed him you guys and it made him laugh ❤️ thank you for uniting swiftie daughters with nfl dads 🤣
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I loved it ❤ watching from Dallas 😂😍
I heard that Travis!😂
From a 9ers fan we share in your Dallas comments. 😅 love the show but go 49ers😤
This is amazing!!!
OUTSTANDING folks. Keep em coming. Happy holidays y'all.
🎉 thank you
I am a fan
This was so cute. Next year they should invite a few players from other teams. Justin tucker from the Raven is an opera singer.
Love this so much! Totally put me in the Christmas spirit ❤
That ending 😂😂😂
Why do all of them have a lowkey good voice
Man, that gave me goosebumps. Love the throwback Charlie Brown animation. And, I never thought the three of you could be better at anything than run blocking and protecting QB1, but you maybe singing is that thing. Already knew Jordan's voice was sublime, but Kelce and Lane sounded amazing. Love this team, love these guys, and thanks for the new Christmas tradition. Fly, Eagles, fly!
Merry Christmas “Except you Dallas” now and always
Lol that was awesome!!!!! Go Eagles!!!!!
So good 🎄♥️
So good. Travis is wack tho
This was BEAUTIFUL... So does this make up for the year we threw snowballs at Santa? 🤔😂 #PHILLYLOVESJASONKELCE ❤
Best Line: Except you Dallas. LOL
Well I know what im playing during Christmas time... Have a merry Philly Special Christmas, everyone. And of course Fly Eagles Fly 💚🦅
😂😂😂😂😂
Best thing I’ve watched in YEARS! 🥹
This was beyond adorable. I hope Jason will continue this tradition after he retires. And if he does, we need a cover of 12 Days of Christmas by Bob and Doug McKenzie with Jason and Travis.
Can we reupload this with Nick Foles in the credits PLEASE!!!
This is absolutely hilariously beautiful. This should be a Christmas staple. ❤
The “except you Dallas” always hurts😢
This was spectacularly done by all involved. Kudos and thank you!
This was special, especially that ending. Loved every second of it
NICK FOLES!!!
This is so AWESOME! Another reason to love my jason and my Eagles!
I love it! "...except you Dallas!"  😆😆🤣🤣🤣
Perfection ❤
For Philly by Philly, thank yous!
I just love this ❤
This was absolutely adorable ❤️
Well done!!!
Amazing!! Love This!! I love how Jordan’s character pushes Travis in the end… Happy  Thanksgiving everybody… Peace ☮️ and ❤Love on Earth … Great Cause!! #Respect ☠️#RaiderNation
I lost it when "St. Nick" showed up!!
I love this so much!!!!! 🦅💚❤️💚❤️
Lane, I love you.

this is so AWESOME
Amazing!   Also extra special bringing Nick into it.  🎉
Oh this is too awesome love every bit of it 💚🎄👍
Adorable loved it
this is seriously the best...i need more
I’m so thankful for being an Eagles fan! We’re in our golden era. Go get one more boys!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This team resonates with the fanbase more than any other team to be in Philly. Gonna miss all these guys so much when they call it quits.
🎄❤️🎄
✨ Nick Fooooles ✨
This is going on my must see annual Christmas special list
Awesome. Love the Eagles and the way they represent Philly.
I loved watching this!
I love how you guys snuck nick foles in there! I own both albums now!
Loved Wyatt, Ellie, and Bennett’s cameos 🥰
This was amazing ! More. More. More.  Keep em coming.
Great job by all-just as I expected!! Philly needs to keep Kelce as long as they can. He is an incredible leader, the best Center, an inspiration to many,and so much more. Wishing everyone a safe and happy Holiday Season. ❤️💚❤️💚 Fly Eagles Fly 💚🦅
The only thing that would make this even more Philly is if they started pelting Santa Clauss with snow balls
I love this! I may or may not have burst into tears when Pretty Paper popped up.
This is too cute ❤it will have to play every year now please 🥰 in prime time
My not yet two year old daughter is obsessed. Watched on repeat for an hour
Instead of Eskimo can it be replaced with Buffalo?
Clever and outstanding!  Who knew those Kelce Bros could carry a tune!
Really enjoyed that thank You  😊😁😊💚🏈💚 and Trav ❤️💛🏈 too😁!!!
This was amazing!!!! ❤❤❤
Great "show"!!  But it needed more Nick!!
2:26 Taylor, what are you doing in their Christmas Special?????
This is one of the many reasons why Philly is the best sports towns in America.
so shkibity toliet
This was wonderful. Philly Love
Jason sounds a bit like Yukon Cornelius in the introduction.  Just love this!
A new Christmas tradition! This was wonderful guys! Thanks for spreading holiday cheer.
Love, love, love this!!! Thank you unPop studios and the Eagles players for doing this!!!
As someone who suffers from depression during the holidays, this genuinely made me smile from ear to ear. GO BIRDS!
Wow what it threw back 👍
Love it!
This is the cutest thing ever🥹😭🤍
Just finished watching the Philly Christmas Special. Very entertaining. Seems our Birds have talent both on And off the field! Go Birds!🦅🏈🎶
I am a Dallas fan and think this is great. I don’t know how a Philly player has become one of my faves but I love Jason. Y’all have a gem. Love the rivalry still. See y’all soon.

This is amazing. Great for all of the kids in the city of Philadelphia!
PETE AND MARIE YOU KILLED IT!!! This is absolutely brilliant! The bit about Saint Nick was genius. I'm going to watch this 100x. Go birds! ❤

Terrific but can we get closed captioning?  So everyone can enjoy this special!
This is AWESOME! Go Birds! 🦅
Wonderfully done ❤🎉🎉🎉

When Jason Kelce said, except for you, Dallas, it got me😂😂😂😂😂
This is amazing!  Just like Philadelphia and just like our EAGLES! Thanks guys, for making everything more, well.. SPECIAL!  GO BIRDS!!! 🦅🦅🦅🦅

Absolutely loved this New Christmas tradition now Merry Christmas to u all from Canada #FLY EAGLES FLY 💙🏈🦅🎅🇨🇦
I’m a Philly native living in KC and loved this! Got a huge laugh when Jordan shoved Travis out of the group at the end 😂 Such camaraderie between all of them!
Love you guys! This was so stinkin' cute! Thank you. 💗
This is so good!!
Love all around❤❤❤❤❤  Happy Holidays‼️
😂 as a cowboys fan that was hilarious 😂😂
This is amazing 😅
I really loved this 🥰 It brought back so many childhood memories with the claymation Christmas specials. All of the Guys and  Pattie were great, I wish it was longer.❤❤
Spectacular!👍
That was great!
3:19 All the shops featured are philadelphia staples:   In Order: DiBruno Brothers, Isgros Pastries and the Happy Birthday Bar
Kelce’s saving the world! (Go Chiefs!)
That wasn’t to bad for a bunch of Birds
Are you kidding me!?! This is amazing!!!! Talent!!

That’s great , that’s coming from a cowboys fan..

This is so cute and fantastic and genius!  Thank you for being the best!
They definitely won me over with the “except you Dallas” at the end. Well done gentlemen! Go Birds!
"Hoo hoo, that performance was TOO lit" LOLOLOLOL😂😂😂
These dudes cannot sing! Stop having 300 pound men sing on YouTube please💀
That’s so nice they showed the claymation creators at the end! ❤
I am a Chiefs fan and I loved this lol
Wonderful, full of laughs.
GO BIRDS!!!
Need that Nick Foles choir hit for a message notification hahahahaha
These big guys can really sing!
That was awesome!!! 🦅🦅🦅
Jeremiah Chapter 10 3For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.  4They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.  5They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.  6Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.  7Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.  8But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.
"except you Dallas" greatest line ever
S0 good
🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Everyone except you Dallas! I love this!!! Great work!!
This is shockingly good
It's still go 49ers but that was awesome
Love u guys!
This is the best Philly Special Christmas ever. 😂🎉🎅🤶🌲
MERRY CHRISTMAS EAGLES 🎉
That was awesome!!!  Nick Foles cameo was brilliant.  Huge Eagles fan since my first visit back in '04.  Merry Christmas from Australia.
👏 Bravo!!! Great animation!! Great Music!! Superb voices!! A new hoilday tradition!!
I can't watch this enough! I went ape s%&t when St. Nick #9 poofed in and teared up when the girls came in. Well done, Go Birds ❤💚
Love  from Canada❤
I held it until we had Claymation Baby Kelces 🥹
This was so cute
You guys rocked it! If you did a video with all the songs from the album and sold it, just think how much money you would raise! Love you guys!
“Except for you Dallas”😂😂
So on top of everything, Jason is a very good voice actor as well. It’s almost unfair.
This really takes me back to the all time classic Christmas shows they used to make! I really love the Philadelphia Eagle's spin on everything! You all did an amazing job! I love how my favorite Bearcats have embraced the city of Philly and have made it their own! Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas everyone!
I love that Jason has the ability to teleport nick foles to him at any time
I propose every team have a Christmas special, I need to hear Dan Campbells pipes.
This made me feel things
Lane is unironically amazing?
This was wonderfully good.. The Claymation team did an amazing job.. Everyone did a great job, the singing and comedy was right on point.. thanks for a good time
Awesome so fun well done
Amazing and the singing love it. Can’t wait for next year’s ❤😊
This needs to be a forever family tradition!!
Class act. Respect.
Is Lane Johnson single? Asking for a friend 👀
Loved it! Next year full length behind the scenes ❤
Go birds! Happy holidays! ❤❤❤
That was awesome!
Loved every moment of it!
Brilliant and well done. Cheers everyone, hopefully peace starts showing up everywhere
Incredible!!!
So good ! thanks guys xx
Very cool- Merry Christmas from a Bills fan
This is the greatest thing ever.
1. This is amazing.  2. Watching Jason scream in between songs is hysterical.
A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!!!! Thank you and GO BIRDS!!
Go birds!!!!!
I loved it!  Thank you for doing this it was great!
This needs to be nominated for the best animated short film at the Oscars.
I was never a big xmas music guy until the Eagles made Christmas albums!
Love it ❤well done. Happy Holidays
WOW - i may not live in Philly or the US - but holy crap!  This was soooooooooooooooooo good.!! Those boys can SING
We all watched this together as a family yesterday! As Eagles fans this was the cutest and most creative show ever!!! We all LOVED it!!!! Merry Christmas Philly! ❤️
This is AWESOME!!!
Merry christmas to all except for dallas😂
This is freaking awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Let's bring it home this year boys! That will be the topper on our tree. You got this.
New Christmas tradition …st.Nick
"...that performance was too lit..."  🤔💕💕🤣
Whut? No snowballs at Santa?  😂
One of the cutest things I've ever seen in my life!! For sure ❤
Absolutely love all the Christmas stuff go eagles
Love it! 💚 Go Birds 🦅
Perfection in claymation. Go Birds!
This is one of the best things I’ve ever seen. Jason Kelce is a national treasure. Travis is aight I guess 😉
🙌🏽❤️🇨🇦
This is gonna be added on a a holiday special… classic. Good job Jason and team. 😂😂😂😂. I love it!!
Big love to the people that made this happen. I'm very impressed with the video and production and hard work it would've taken to set all these characters up, stop motion is an absolute fave of mine and y'all killed it!❤️ The music sounds so good, I can't wait to play this during family dinner with the fam for Christmas
I love this!
This is amazing!!!
Great job putting this together.  Getting us all into the Christmas spirit 😊. Congratulations on having 128,524 viewers 🎉. But only 11 likes 🤔. The 128,513 who didn't press the like button on this video is getting coal in their Christmas stocking 😂
Last year we raised 1.25m, this year lets break that record. For children.
Brilliantly done everyone loved it
The channeling of Yukon Cornelius by Kelce is magnificent
The stop motion was incredible!! 👏👏👏
❤
Jason, Lane & Jordan need to wear the suits from the end of the video for the Christmas day game against my Giants. That way I won't be as annoyed when you ruin my Christmas day 🤣🤣🤣
Happy Holidays to everyone!!! I definitely enjoyed the Philly Christmas Special!!
How many times did you watch it?  Yes....if anyone can watch it just once I think there is something wrong with them and they should get themselves checked out by a cardiologist. Freaking adorable. I think Travis has competition on the show business thing at retirement, at the very least when it comes to voice overs and singing. Love Jason's rough voice.
"We'd like to wish everyone in Philly and around the world a very special Christmas!" .... "Except you Dallas!" ... watching this over breakfast in the UK, I spat my tea all over the floor when Mailata said that.
I’m a packers fan but I hope this Eagles team wins the Super Bowl just because of these guys.
This was funny and wonderful!!! ❤
Nick Foles cameo❤
I love the show, it‘s so speciale💚💚💚
it's a tradition now,, every holidays season
NEEDS MORE CHRISTMAS (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
Ha everyone except you Dallas. classic 😂
Jordan hitting Travis at the end was amazing😂😂😂
Pave the Lave : A Country Christmas
It's NOW officially Christmas Time
Excellent job!!!
You scored a tuddy, grand slam, and 4-pointer with this short! Congrats to the Eagles boys, the creators, Travis and Miss Patti for this adorable video.  Lane's voice is like "buttah" and he could have a second career in country music!  Jason and Jordan have great pipes too. Such fun to watch. Congratulations guys!
This deserves some kind of award
This was so enjoyable.
Awsome love it
Because it’s not really Christmas until you have Travis Kelce and Merrill Reese in the booth commentating a Philly lineman and Patti LaBelle claymation Christmas concert. 😂😂😂
As a HUGE fan of Rankin Bass, this is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! New Christmas show to add to the rounds!
like this if they should do a live concert at the linc and donate the money to a charity of their choice ❤️
Awesome this needs to be on tv a new Christmas show thanks for this ur all awesome 🎉🎉🎉❤
Fabulous! Go birds!  Not you Dallass....🔥
I Fucking love this team my god
I guess KC and Philly fans can always unite over their common hate of the Cowboys.
This is the best!! It would be awesome if y’all could make a whole claymation >1hr movie! It would no doubt become a Christmas classic for generations to come! 🎄🎅☃️
can we get a whole movie? this is great.
This is great!  Jason needs thicker eyebrows, though, LOL!
Wait wait wait, who did the voice of Nick Foles? Because if it wasn't Nick himself, it _really_ sounded like him!
This was amazing!
❤
NICK FOLES?!?!?!?!
This is just insanely good! That took so much work. Also The Nick Foles bit was hilarious!
OMGGGGGG
Dislikes are from Dallas
Happy Thanksgiving everyone. Love the claymation and singing
A new Christmas favorite!!! Love the Dallas slam. Cowboys suck!!! E-A-G-L-E-S!!! EAGLES!!!
This was fantastic....great job to all involved and how sweet that Jason's daughters made the production
More,more, more!!!
how are they all so good? esp Lane sounds like an angel
Thanky you, really teared up at the end... Wishing everyone a nice and save christmas. Go Birds
I want these Christmas figures.
Damn man philly social media team is fucking killing it
God ... whoever yours may be ... bless us all!
This was genuinely AMAZING! Raider fan here, but you already know what album I will be rockin to this Christmas! So well done, and so funny, gonna have to be a Christmas must watch now!
This was awesome!! Thank you guys for putting in the work to provide this to us!! Hope everyone had a happy and healthy holiday and got to enjoy some time with the people you love!
Only Philly could produce this level of art! Happy Holidays 92%ers and to all 💚🦅💚🦅💚🦅
Fly 🦅 Fly!! Best team in the world !!
i need a real-life version of that blue velvet with snowflakes suit!
Great job!!
I LOVE that Connor Barwin is involved. Miss him on the field.
That Dallas comment was uncalled for. GO COWBOYS!!
Just had to Google citywide special. Classic!
Absolutely the best! Loved it!
This will now be a Christmas tradition to watch ever year… move over frosty! 🦅
If you’re reading this happy Thanksgiving , marry Christmas, happy holidays, and a happy new year. I hope 2024 is better than your 2023 was and I wish you all happiness, peace, and prosperity.
This was just awesome so well done!! Even the girlies Wy, Ellie, and Bennie were so adorable!! Everyone on this project did such a great job!! 💚🦅🥰👏 🎉 #HandsomeAndPretty #KingOfSouthPhilly #KelceBros #PhillyChristmas
Above and beyond a great sequel to last year. Wonderful job!
Except you, Dallas.
This is awesome.  Just what I needed to end my Thanksgiving day!
Cute!
this is such a happy musical 🎄🙏✨
This was absolutely so much fun to watch. GO BIRDS
loooove it !  This special should be in amazon prime or Netflix as a Christmas show.  Bravo !
How joyful well done - have a great Christmas from NZ
expect you dallas😭
Unbelievable content here, bravo to everyone involved. I seriously mean it, this means a lot to me and I hope all other Eagles fans! Considering this is also a sample of the future content!!  Like Jalen Hurts said, he'd do anything for Philly. I'm not sure all fans will return his sentiment but I pray and hope for this... This Christmas!  That even if our chips are down, please let the team and organisation know we are behind them (not following the media hype or negativity). It's the least we can do for all on the team (past & present) have done for us as Eagles fans.  My support and my family's support is behind the team 100% through thick and thin. Win or loss. In sickness and in health....   I hope fellow fans agree with me.
Jason makes Philly likable lol
Perfection!  Thank you ..
Perfection!  Thank you ..
Loved it!! Happy Thanksgiving!
What a wonderful Christmas gift!!! Thank you to everyone involved, this actually made me laugh AND cry in seven minutes!!
Omg what a fun skit!!!  What a great production!!!  Love the Travis take down....Merry Christmas!
This is awesome! Reminds me of the old Christmas clay cartoons! Happy Holidays! ❤
Lane must have been unavailable. His character never speaks.
This brings back memories of the claymation Christmas shows I watched as a kid! This was so well done! Jason Kelce and the guys are awesome! Keep doing what you do. Go Birds! 🦅
Kelce Kach Kristmans
Soooooo cute, loved it!!!!!!❤❤❤❤ Encore

Congratulations eagles!!!!! Happy Christmas everyone 🎉
This was awesome!! This is great. And final sentence saying “merry Christmas to everyone… except you Dallas”.  That had me 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣!
I’m a Steelers fan but I gotta show some respect to Jason Kelce.  Guy has done as much for Philly as anyone.  Best Eagle ever.
literally thought this was animated not by hand.
Bring on Saint Nick!!

Absolutely beautiful 🥺🎅
This is so great. Let's kick off a great holiday season.
Epic
Great work animators! That was fun! Nothing like a visit from St. Nick during the holidays.
This needs to get to the trending page of youtube...or as they would say "New Heights"
I love the Kelce brothers and everything about this!! Hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and a very Merry Christmas! ❤
This was so awesome! I can’t wait to get the whole album!

NO DUMB QUESTIONS: When did you guys start this project? How long did they work on the stop animation? How long to get permission for the "Peanuts" animation style?
What a sweet end to Thanksgiving! Y’all nailed it! Great work!
How cute! This special warmed my heart. Thank you...and Go Birds!
Jason saying "old Saint Nick" and having Foles poof in was not something I was expecting but it was a good surprise.
This was so freaking adorable!

i got kicked out of my family home a few months ago and the Christmas album helped me feel merry. I got invited for Thanksgiving dinner at ny family home and it's been nothing but smiles and laughs. Im glad this album exists cause it really kept my spirits high this year.
