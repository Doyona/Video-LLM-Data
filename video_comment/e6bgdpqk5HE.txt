Gary's United top 4 prediction was fucken waaaaaaayyyyyy off lol
Watching this back now makes me laugh, and makes liverpools achievements so much bigger
25.21 "Practice?" 😂
Just ´discovered´ the overlap, binging it now. So funny to see episodes of a year ago.
United top 4 😂😂😂
Jamie almost cried there 😅 01:21:43
5:25 Gandhi 😂😂😂
United top 4 ahahahahhaha
im 38 years old,and this is easily one of my favourite shows to watch. it has a bit of everything, and so "cozy". i also like and know a bit football,but its not just thats. Thanks guys,keep it up please. Cheers from Portugal
32.25 was that a fart 😂😂😂
A lot of talking over the top of each other in this episode
Eyy! Eyyy! 26.24 2nd is last innit - Roy Keane 😂😂😂
the neck cracking thing gary hahaha douchy
25:36 😂😂
Carra was spot on 1:05:40
LMao these clowns all putting united in the top 4 ahead of liverpool. i came here just for that and of course they didnt disappoint
1:02:00 is the part everyone is here looking for. Just to make it easy for you all :D
Great watching these Liverpool predictions 😂
Roy just sounded abit jeloues that he didn’t go on the stage at the concert
i want Ian as a mate
Keane is wel jel 🙂
Ipswitch are staying up they have heart
5:25 gandhi 🤣🤣
*Ian shovelling sugar into his cup* "Right, I've only had 2 sugars" 🤣🤣🤣
Is Gary considered cool in UK culture? Because guys like him in the states are seen as massive dorks
Carra and never might as well get married at this point😂
Roy is the best…
Started doing in the morning before shower and work definitely wakes you up had to down the weight a bit it's deceptively difficult on 15kg dumbells.
49:56  Conviction!
Keane can’t put a tackle in on opponents anymore so he has to get his anger out by bashing Gary 😂😂😂.
Their predictions were pointless. Gary and Roy for so called 'experts' can't just be unbias and realise Liverpool will easily finish above United this year
1:23:30 no one better than Ian Wright to give advice on this subject
"how donthey do that?" "Training"  Is Roy's new "thats his job" 😂😂😂
the same Gary Neville face 🤣
Hopefully Ugarte makes that midfield more free to attack and play exciting football. Casemiro sort of gives the other midfielders a fear that they can't really push far high cause they'll be left exposed
Really enjoyed this, love Rafa’s insights, his approach to the game and great to see that his passion is still there!
Carragher always sounds like he has a mouthful of phlegm
Neville has lost his head
Honestly, Gary just lost any shred of credibility saying United will be in top 4 and liverpool won't, seriously
Cheers gandhi 😂 there relationship is a marriage
They seriously suggested Liverpool wouldn't be in the top 4 but Man Ure would? Unbelievable Jeff.
Gary deserves it all lmao
Zubi zubi doo were are you👀👀😂😂
Panel - "How do these Olympians do all these super human things, it looks impossible?!"  Roy - "Training, practice. Do yer job."
The big 6 talk is so boring honestly. Glad the big 6 is slowly being broken up year by year
Ian Wright is a good bloke. I’d get on with him.  Brilliant . Emotional stuff re Kevin Campbell and his brother . Legend x
when roy drops an exasperated 'jeeeeeesus' - always cracks me up
The cheeky little look jamie and gary gave each other when they both knew they would've LOVED to have gone on the stage with Steve Nicks LMFA
Gary leave the pioneers alone lol
Didn’t realise Carragher had left.
Behind the scenes is the greatest thing about this podcast
Roy Keane is a west Brit. Talking about gold medals in rowing? Speak up Roy.
I love watching these
All I wanna do is do it
Liverpool will win the league this year. This episode will be embarrassing to watch again.
Love how much Roy is busting Gary’s balls first 5 minutes into the video 😂😂
1:24:16 Roy hugging Ian "Gandhi" Wrighty 😂😂😂😂😂
1:22:34 FERGUSON!! 😂😂
1:17:04 Roy roasting Gary Lineker, for no reason  😂😂😂
1:01:25 is Roy gonna listen? 😂😂😂😂
46:52 Carragher winding up Neville 😂😂😂
34:05 that revamped Club World Cup is nonesense. No matter which way you look at it
@jamie Carragher hope you enjoyed your holiday did you find out how that innocent child you spat on is doing?
29:15 prayers to Kevin Campbell's departed soul and love his family. Prayers to Wrighty's brother and his family. That was emotional to listen to.
28:29 sending my love to Ian Wright. To lose two people that you loved and cared for is tough. Stay strong, Wrighty ❤
25:45 proper Hitmam💯
20:01 poor Adidas getting the wrath of Roy Keane 🤣🤣
Great!!
5:41 YEAH GO TO CONCERTS, BUT DONT GO ON THE STAGE 😂😂😂😂😂
5:28 Ian "Gandhi" Wright😂😂😂. Not gonna lie, but Roy is underrated comedic timing wise 😂😂. Those glasses do make Ian look like Gandhi 😂
2:20 well Jamie Carragher is the best pundit they have got. His memory of the stuffs that happened during previous games of any era is incredible.
Tottenham top 4 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Liverpool all day long.
Signing of the season is Gundo coming home to City on a FREE. 5 in a row and winning all the silverware that is available to an English club, Community Shield, DONE, League Cup, FA Cup, Prem League , Champions League, Super Cup , World Club Cup..In Pep We Trust. BMR...
someones got to hire pickpockets on these guys next week
Even Roy’s Humour has you on edge 😅
Roy is just brilliant
Thank fuggs Carra's back,Rooney was like a block of concrete but with less charisma and it was annoying when they "discussed" LFC it was just in relation to the non event of the failed transfer. However,as much as I loved Klopp he draws that Ipswich game all day long and that would've been down to a late equalizer,great in game thinking by Slott.
Man Utd top 4? In 5 years time maybe
As a south asian I highly object to the different types of accents you guys have. Its like hearing French  Im sorry but it is great hurdle for guys like us
Nev "Did you hear Arteta hired pickpockets to take wallets and watches from the players on a night out..... the message was to always stay alert"  Keane "well thats them winning the league then"   💀🤣
Roy thinks he's Gary's dad 😂😂
United must just live rent free in Carra's mind, with two/three former United players on the panel, he is the most biased and triggered everytime they come up in conversation 😅😅 Honestly, the pod is better without him, he adds little value when he's on.
Don't overlook Villa for top 4.
Whats that word for the fear of missing out?
I swear people forget how much city spent to get where they are plus the 115 charges
What’s with all the eating seriously, listening to them eat ruins it
The surprise of the season will be Zirkze
I will go 1st Arsenal 2nd City 3rd Man U and 4th Villa
Gary! Mount is terrible.We need to play a flat 433 with Mainoo/Fernandes/Casimero Rashford maybe/Zirkzee down the middle and Garnacho left
He should play Viera as a false number 9
Lost his place to Trossard 😂 Martinelli is mustard
How has the overlap not got 5 million subs?
Will you guys ever do a stick to football LIVE? It would be great to come and watch one of these in person in an arena
Roy Keane is such a wind up merchant 😅😅😅😅😅 he’s fuckin hilarious 🤣 😂😂😂
Shock Neville is desperate for Liverpool to go back the way they were before Klopp. Can see how excited about it he is too
Carrragher always loud when it's United then slows down when it's Liv. Couldn't give an honest answer when the player rejected them. Lol
Best one liner of this was at 19:22 from Carra: “They’d be better off trying to close their pockets”😂
United and Spurs above Liverpool. Just refusing to be informed. Villa as well are better than those two. ABSOLUTE JOKE.
I missed having Jamie on to call the United boys out on their ish
Villa will be above United
arteta done the pickpocket thing as a lesson/reminder of this: stay alert at all times, the same way your phone/watch got stolen when you lost focus, you can have 3 points stolen if you have a single lapse in concentration, only takes a second for an equaliser to be scored against you
Chezora is the gate keeper in my opinion
Roy has too much of a hard-on for Gary  sometimes.  It's mildly funny up to a point. There was an awkward silence when everyone thought Roy was taking it too far.
Community Question. how do you send them?
In Nigeria sometimes peoples skin get cut because there trousers were too tight, so Gazz be aware 😂😂😂, you can tell what era Jamie is from he said bookmark it 😂😂😂🤣
So much yelling and bickering, the show really needs some structure again - it's absolutely chaotic to listen to.
Listening to Wrighty talking about Kevin and his brother is tough. RIP to both.
You talk sense wrighty
Had to turn it off after 50 mins when they all just started shouting over each other.
Ben is a legend, get the man a seat at the table for goodness sake 👍👍
Honestly Liverpool supporters live in an alternate reality. Carragher "Back when Liverpool were 3rd and 4th in the league." Thats where they are now ffs.
What’s wrong with Garry going in the booth. Keane needs to get off his back nothing wrong with Garry supporting his mate
Roy Keane is always good for a laugh--MOST of the time, but sometimes I understand why Ferguson said there was relief in the dressing room when Keane had left.
I think metaphorically you have to beat City twice because they have enough quality players to put a new team in front of you the second time and you need 92 points. City have reset the standard for PL winners. I don't think Arsenal's depth of squad is enough yet and they need more substance in front of goal. Havertz isn't enough. Saka, while excellent isn't enough. They need more to get up to 92 points.
Bring on Millie next week
They have to bring this on tour. All 5 of them would be great entertainment live.
The answer Roy, is because he's a massive CHAMPAIGN SOCIALIST.
A curious thing about the chat around the olympics is that theres no mention that alot of the olympics is technically amateur. most of those training so hard have to return to work monday morning. To balance both is incredible!
You can see how much it bothers Carragher when people say anything negative about Liverpool. Never takes it on the chin and always chirps up about United/Ten Hag
Love this show.
Surprise - United will be top2 by xmas!!! Considering no injuries😊
Class
Love watching a team of 1st class players that play at 100% .
One thing is no secret and gary really hate liverpool but anyhow if liverpool miss the top 6 would be really a surprise   Hot take : liverpool gonna win the league ❤
Taking points of city isn’t the problem for arsenal it’s the fact that 5years into arteta they are still loosing points to teams they shouldn’t be simple
Wrighty:"Can you imagine Gary dancing?" Roy:"NO!"  the man is a natural comic 🤣
Oscar bobb is a stupid pick for POTS ffs
blimey - give em that holiday extension ffs!
Leave city alone nothing will happen to them don't worry just enjoy the futball they play
Love you Wrighty proper hero but got to say Kean is world class on this show
Wrighty is a gem
WHYYYY do they have to eat and drink? Fine, have the first part be that, but once it starts, just remove it. I wish we could get this series without that, its sooo infuriating to listen to.
Everton v Brighton  West Ham v Villa  Brentford v Palace  Both teams went for different results yet none picked the result of any of those games let alone the score. 😅
"You say this every season!" It literally happened the season before last.
Roy is getting steadily more tetchy on this podcast
The conversations, chemistry, and banter between these 5 are great, looking forward to these shows throughout the season. Sometimes better than the actual football. 👍🙂
where is the line with rest though? regular normal gym goers hit the gym 6 days a week for years, doesn't a professional sports player just stay fit? why would you do nothing for 2-3 weeks?
Hey guys, You've got to play this for Wrighty and the lads.  https://www.facebook.com/reel/1520289805512210
Get CANTONA on lads
2 nil. correct.
All the Overlap podcasts are a good laugh, but funniest thing is Gary Neville and Roy Keane’s delusional prediction that United will finish above Liverpool, cracks me up every time, talk about living on past glories😂😂😂
Carragher is so tiresome
Anyone think Roy is absolutely hilarious..brilliant guy
We need Benitez Ferguson & Wenger to come on the show at some point
Roy calling Ian Gandhi is a gag I'm ready to enjoy all season 🤣
Wrighty needs to do Kendall Calling
Grieving is a process! 🥲
My sides hurt, Roy is timing. 😂
I absolutely love The Overlap…but as “podcasts” go, the constant over-talking with five different conversations is infuriating
So are we just going to pretend that relegation doesn't exist so nobody's feelings get hurt
Sending Wrighty strength and prayers at this difficult time YNWA! 🙏❤
Neville saying we’re not doing negativity but his hatred for Liverpool overrules his head because saying Utd will finish in the top 4 😂 and Liverpool won’t is mind blowing.
man I thought they were done with carragher .. ah well
ian wright is a cool cat man
Roy's not wrong about the mannequin 😂😂
Cheers Gandi 😂😂
It’s amazing that Carragher is now 46 years old and STILL hasn’t learned to not constantly interrupt others when they’re talking
Respect newcastle. Top 4 without Europe easy
This lot are an absolute Tonic, and not forgetting Kieran, 👏 he's like the unofficial member, class 👏 👌
Why is the prem predictions and fam questions the shortest parts of this? Absolute shite
Must have been stunned when super six started and they realised Newcastle still actually exist
Glad no one said foden considering how horrific he was in the euros
Roy actually getting so annoying and jarring with his negativity
Is Gary okay on this show. Seems very tense and worried about Man U season. Bless him
Good shout on Bobb.
Jesus Gary do you ever stop eating 😂😂😂
You know when your were younger and you get a top that’s way too big for your age and people say ,ah you will grow into it , this is how I feel about Gary and his personality , he’s an old man in a middle aged man’s body , don’t worry , you will grow into it
Ian wright like a spoilt brat always had to get a word in or thinks he’s missing out on somit
Casemiro is definitely looking more fit than last year, i think with new Cass and Mainoo in midfield i think Utd wont be as open, its now to see how Zirkzee and Hojlund will do up front,
The pair of them are brilliant hated Neville for years but let's be honest he's grown on us hard working lad shame he's a manc 😂😂❤
5 minutes in Roy putting Gary down for getting out of his comfort zone and being excited about it.   Basically Gary needs to lighten up and be more fun, but only if he does that by doing things Roy approves of.   Gary looking exhausted during the uncalled for battering at the start
Everybody ignores newcastle which is probably good  we had a worse injury crisis than anybody with tonali back and holding onto isak and gordon and no europe no reason newcastle cant be top 4
The reason why the Rodgers envelope thing was stupid is cause he said "make sure you're not one of the names" - if he's already written the names how can the players stop themselves from being one of the names? 🤣🤦
Can we get Lee Sharpe on here as a guest this szn?? Think it would be brilliant!!
Gary called it. 4 central mids w/ split strikers.
1:11:20 fatboy slim 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was signed by United in 1995 when I was 15 years old, but I couldn't become a player because the family of kidnappers that I was living with wouldn't allow me to play, do you think that was fare?
Gotttta start questioning Arsenals big spending and lack of trophies. Its baron. If he dont win this season then hes been a huge flop  Most cringe manager in PL history!!
Hard hearing Ian talk about loss, keep your head up my guy
I loose count on how many times those tea pots are re filled 🤣
Best show in Football this is 👍
Not doing relegation is a cop out You're pundits !!
Please play the prank call on Gary Neville in one EP
Funny watching this now after the Fulham game and Gary being completely correct with the 4 triple 2 style of play
Roy from Ballinderry park and talks like a?????
I really don't think any of them like Gary anymore
Oscar bob is out for 7 months
Mainoo and fernades are the only good players in united everyone else is mid or basic
I get frustrated when Jamie is in episodes. He struggles to listen and is desperate to get this point across
Too much talking at once - the worst episode
Tell what would make this great is if you all speak together so no one can hear a thing 😂
Carragher: “yeah but they had all of them last season.”  Well yeah technically they were all at the club, but Casemiro missed three months out injured, Mainoo didn’t play till mid November due to injury, and Mount missed virtually the entire season.   Really tired of pundits either intentionally ignoring or just forgetting about all the injuries United had to deal with last season. It wasn’t just defensive injuries, it was all through the squad. The only area of the team where we had first choice players consistently fit was out wide.
Here you go then biggest shock slott goes and Liverpool sign Emery as new manager 😉 😂
Oh look , Roy your up talk about United, 20 secs in Neville takes over talking bollox as usual
Keano reminds one at times of Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon.  Chaotically charismatic.
“Don’t film my sugar” *zooms in on sugar input*
"Second's last" Keane, NEVER change!
I honestly get pissed these pundits talk about Arsenal in a pale and pathetic light, We had to struggle up until now and we don't still get the respect that we deserve.  Stupid
Wrighty your loved mate stay strong ❤
Rest in Power Super Kev💙❤️
Ian wright Legend thank you for being you
Listening to Gary talk tactics makes you understand why his management career went so horribly. Good pundit and I like a bit of his opinions but when it comes on to team tactics he's dusted man 🤣
Ben Ben Ben Ben! G'warnnn Ben.
Oh wow, I didn't know how much I have missed this show, till now! Roy, oh Roy, we ALL need Roy in our lives to ensure our feet are kept on the ground. He is FANTASTIC
Wrighty 💚💚💚
I wonder if Luke Shaw watched this episode, "his always injured" 🤣😂
Sending love to uncle Wrighty ❤️
It's so much shouting and chaos it's hard to understand sometimes.
"He's a business man but down with the kiiiids" Gary really is David Brent sometimes.
🍻
Carragher just ruins these. Theres never stress or arguing when he’s not there and he just disrupts things to get a reaction. The last month without him has been brilliant and I hope that that’s the future of this show
Not a very well done episode was it ?
I can’t tell you how much I love watching this podcast! 👌🤣
Jamie listen
Jaime saying Gary always picks Utd to finish ahead. Last 12 years Utd have finished ahead 6 and won 1 league and Liverpool finished ahead 6 and won 1 league
Can this be done without Carragher? The reason why United were so open coz the defence were so deep... which also meant that the attacking structure was stretched. Simples
Too many games yes why should be no carling cup replay
How did no-one pick up that 28 days is 4 weeks 😂
Did it properly might have got first 💯
Ian Wright sorry
Witchunt against ten hag must stop no utd manager post alex gets this nonsense
Gary my fav
Worry about your own dutch manager jamie even ten hag bet klopp more than klopp bet him.
Good 👍
Jamie Carragher makes me not want to watch this podcast sometimes. How do you honestly continue the negative agenda against Ten Hag. Like what’s the point. We get that you just want to be controversial and all for likes but that’s not your job mate. Speak facts and stop this Negative BS. SACKED BEFORE. CHRISTMAS When the management just said he is staying and they are backing him is crazy.  Overlap team kept saying let’s not be negative and he clearly just is.  If he doesn’t change, and just does his freaking job this show will lose something and become a thing of the past. It’s soo freaking irritating.
DJ Nevzz in da house
Not having Liverpool in the top 4 while having United there is actual insanity😂😂😂
Just watched Wrighty hosting Top of the Pops in 1997 , on YouTube.. has Roy seen it ?
I’d much rather watch this for 3 hours before kick off on a Saturday. It’s way better than any football show on TV at the moment. Superb.
In defense of Gary, Ten Hag used a 442 diamond at Utrecht and a couple of times at Ajax so I'm sure we are gonna see that more often this season when all the midfielders are available. If the wingers are injured or out of form, Zirkzee and Hojlund could be pretty complementary up front.
You can say what you like about Carra but this show is sooo much better with him in it his personality, he counterpoints a lot, interacting with each guest. Rooney is boring to listen to, Carra brings more energy in and I'm starting to see him and Keane having a bit more banter. He was also the 1st one to wish Keane Happy Birthday Showing their friendship has grown! It's a perfect Blend and they work well together when there's a guest too.
I'm sorry guys.. ROY is the show!!! That is all.
Wrighty ❤ stay strong fella
What a shock that Stick to Football 50% Man Utd think Man Utd have a chance of top 4. they'll likely not get in the top 10.
Feel sorry for Wrighty talking about losing his brother. Don't really see public personalities talk about stuff like this.
Don't film my sugar (covers the camera) 'move to camera 2'
Wheres is wazza?
You guys made me laugh. Loved it
Carragher comparing Klopp to Wenger and Fergie again, will someone please tell him Fergie won 13 EPL titles while Klopp won just one!!!  Please stop dressing mutton up as lamb Jamie!!!
Love your show, but way too much talking & shouting over each other in this one. My ears actually hurt!!
Hearing wright'ys voice break 😢
Happy Birthday Mate.
Biggest shock...Tottenham winning the league
You moving on or what? Love it!!! 😂 right after a hard time 😢
Roy Keane is just a classic uk grandad
Roy being sulky of Sir Alex not doing this to him back then got me 😂😂😂1:22:34  you can never hate this version of Roy tbh
Did Jamie just give credit to Casemiro? 😂
Winners - Liverpool Top 4 - City, Ars, United Relegated -??? Player of the season - Darwin Nunez
Must admit, used to love watching these at the start but there are now far too many people shouting at the same time, especially Carragher and Neville squeaking at their highest pitches.   If you want good debate, put somebody in there to control it so we can hear your points of view rather than a slanging match.
When Gary starts talking tactics is really clear he is absolutely clueless - Carraghers tactical knowledge is far superior.
The conversation at the start about Gary on stage was brilliant. Callig Ian Wright 'Ghandi'. :D
The lad doing the super six looked like he wanted to scream at them like a school teacher
Top bloke Ian Wright, fair play for opening up ❤
Gary just tries too hard
Wrighty❤
Ian Wright Absolute total respect bro❤
Such pathetic biased against Liverpool from the 2 ex Man Utd players. Credibility in the bin. Grow up
How can garry not know the Turkish assasin
Duplantis is the GOAT pole vaulting
Gary has to let it go utd will be lucky to be top 5
City,chelsea,Arsenal,Villa,Newcastle,Liverpool,Utd.
Sorry but when have Liverpool as of late beat city twice in a season
if he had the proper gear he probably would have come first lol cracked me up
Was really looking forward to this....turned out to be 5 people consistently shouting over each other. Worst episode so far, hopefully just a one off
Keanooooo
It's better with carragher on he's got stories and can take banter
Gary loves 2tier kier
It never does Ian, I am the last one out of seven brothers never easy day by day year by year. Now I get choked up watching anything that is nice to see.
Best football podcast ever, absolutely love it.
Wrighty ❤️🤍
Let's be frank Gary's been absolutely torcherd they
Hi lads, the videos are become more unprofessional with each episode.
It's mad how many teams moaned about fifa and uefa putting to many games on ,but all these teams are off to USA, Japan everywhere to play pre season tournaments 😂
Gary talks waffle
Ian wright is clsss
28 mins onwards heartbreaking...wrighty is the purerist guy
Yeah Tottenham. Top four.
1:11:24 Roy and Wrighty just realizing that Arsenal hardly concede goals, their faces😂
Them singing happy birthday to Roy Roy: Celebrations… slightly over the top 😂
Love you, Wrighty
The enthusiasm and excitement when it comes to Predictions is heartwarming.  Onwards and upwards for best Footie Podcast going.
Man City have one point from Arsenal but still win the league. It's not about winning at city, it's about winning the 'smaller' teams when u should.
Let’s do a season preview episode…  - Man Utd - Liverpool - Man City - Arsenal  Done!  😐
1:05:20 Man City will be found guilty on some of their charges, get a massive point deduction, and still win the league. Poor seasons for everyone in the top 2-6
Their best episode yet. Starting the season strong 👊
Why is Keane so bothered 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can smell a bit of saltiness there lol
Up there with the best of podcast
Roy is hilarious “he’s going to add to the chaos, run everywhere and 6 months on the treatment table” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finally Wrighty someone acknowledging synchronised swimming, the level of difficulty is INSANE
Have to say when I first heard it as a b side on Hindu times I was thinking why a beside, it's brilliant!! Beautiful song!! Should have been on the album or a single!! Oasis , last r'n'r band
Gary talking like 1.5hr podcast is hard work. Cmon mate
Superb episode once again,the insight what the guys give you as regards professional football you struggle to find on other podcasts,the mixture of ppl just works brilliantly.
That Oscar Bobb pick aged like milk.
Roy is being extra Keane on this one. 😂
Roy was in top form for this one 😂😂😂
Putting United into the top 4 when Chelsea literally finished above them last season 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️🫣 dead pundits
Gary wasn't tired, just nervous about seeing Roy 😂
Wright is such a great guy, respect to him been through a lot!
I hate the way you do about 5 mins of highlights of whats coming up on the podcast before it actually starts. It's so annoying and unnecessary.
Better without. Carragher, better chemistry
Oscar Bob 🤦🏻‍♂️
Didn’t understand anything during the predictions round. Three different conversations at once.
😭😭😭😭💀Rodri ghosted Man City board. He ignored their emails and texts when he was on holiday. They didn’t know where and how he was till he showed up to training😭😭 that’s what players should start doing
City won't win THAT game.
United over Liverpool in top 4 😂 United are not going make it in top4. These Mancs just hate Liverpool 😂
Roy makes every episode worth watching
Roy ripping into Double denim guy , ffs he wouldn’t even look at Roy after that , brilliant😂😂😂
This show is incredible. Truly. I love that these are real people showing real emotions and real thoughts. Just incredible.
Wrighty man😢
Neville like a different person with Carragher on. They just push each other's buttons. Carragher was steaming after Gary said Liverpool wont get top 4
I am not being funny but seriously Ian Wright is the best what this country has to offer now! National treasure! So much love and pure kindness from this man, rare!!
Roy, "We had Stevie Wonder in goal"
This one was poor.  Lots of talking over each other and too afraid to give their opinions as its "Negative"
Kudos to the team for showing Wrighty some love ❤️
Why when Gary says something about United that Jamie doesn't agree with or like, does Jamie just completely shouts him down and try to belittle him? Just let him make his point!!
Go on Roy put your other fingers on it 🤣 broke me 😂
2:29 in,Roy says something, Gary smiles but clearly bricking it for forgetting his captains birthday. Absolutely hilarious and unforgivable all in one fell swoop Gary 😆😉👍😂
cant hear a word half the time with microphone friendlyfire
I just wanna know if that's a giant croissant in the middle of the table or a funky loaf of bread.
As much as I enjoy these, the shouting over each other is starting to get on my nerves.
Oscar bob ruled out for months 😭
How did Gary not see the viral parts of the Olympics!? 😂 Does he not talk to anyone?
Ian Wright. Such a gent.
Throwing Carragher back in just messes with the dynamic - gets too loud too much.
Biggest shock will be city ti get relegated
If you don't think Liverpool will finish above United this season, you're high as a kite. Neville's United bias is utterly wild.
what a fekin brillaint show
"its a giant mini roll..." Or just... a roll 😂
Stay strong Wrighty ❤️ love to you and the family my man!
You no when someone try’s to take the piss out that one person and it’s just not funny, that was this hole episode
Gary Neville comparing Szoboszlai, Endo and Mac Allister to Eriksen, McTominay, Casemiro, Mount, Mainoo and Fernandes genuinely hurt my head.  Hes comparing 3 players to 6. Of those 3 of Liverpools one was injured for nearly 3 months.  How about add in Elliott, Jones, and Gravenberch and now tell us which you'd prefer??
Do they get paid for this? My friends and I do this every week for free!
Big love wrighty stay strong
Roy struggled there as a non hugger when Wighty talked about his brother and Kev.
Luv these shows
Hearing 5 people chat loudly over each other at the same time is great for listener enjoyment 🎉
Death is everywhere at the moment.  So many gone in past couple years.  And so many with life changing illnesses too.   Just saying. It’s facts in my circle of friends, family and people I know.
Most chaotic episode yet. Still in pre-season mode
This is like big brother. 😂
Big love to Wrighty, stay strong brother. ❤️
Apparently the pick pocketer found half the united team in Saliba’s pocket
Such a great show as always. The last bit is hilarious. “Oh here we go…. 😂” They know Wrighty is about to go on and on about his story 😂
Grief is like a stone in your pocket. It will feel heavy at first, but over time, you will get stronger, and that stone will feel lighter.
Neville giving his left wing opinions sitting in his mansion ,,,🫣🤡…vote for labour … absolute joke of a person
What is g nev on about
American and Canadian Jamie
Why isn’t Jamie allowed to say that Man U will sack their manager and be told it’s too negative??? On a lighter note we need more of Ben
Roy's face when Ian talks about arsenal 😂
Another great Episode.
Best podcast out there honestly love the personalities together
It's so tough now to win the league. I think some teams now need to concentrate on a certain cup and just win something because that battle for the premier league is just unbelievable
lol this is genius
I agree with loads others here, I need Wrighty in my life 👍. Makes me smile . Top Bloke
Good shout for the ‘red rum club’ saw em last year , I was impressed, very good 👍👍
United - not only about being open in midfield...its the CBs staying high shrinks the space in transition!!!
This was an hour of nonsense and 24 minutes on the preview of the season………
We all love ya Wrighty ❤
No mentioning of the 118 year world record broken by the Pakistani Javelin throwing Arshad Nadeem 92.97….
All the best Ian, hope your year gets better and better, you deserve it pal.........
Oh, they will definitely win the league this year.😂😂😂😂😂 Keane is great
DJ Neville on the wheels of steel 📀💿
Roy would get in an argument in an empty room!!!
32:26 does someone fart?
I dont know if there's anyone I've seen Roy keane respect more than Carragher.
Them all being mates makes the show great but Jesus when they talk over each other it’s unwatchable
Love the switch of camera angle as Wrighty tries to hide his sugar.
Why does Roy Keane think everybody has to do things as he does or wants 😅 the man's got a major god complex 😂
United top 4 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think you need one more lioness in, to balance it a bit more! But I love this show.. :)
Arsenal should sign Ollie Watkins ⚽️
Carras inhale is acc so insane lool
Thoughts and prayers for wrighty and his family
Such hypocrisy from Carra - happy to slag off Utd when it comes to lack of signings and no plan B, C, etc, but when it comes to Liverpool he has no answer  when Roy says "surely big teams would have a plan B or C" and also "it's so complicated" to get this signing done because the buyout clause is complicated in Spain. LOL whatever.    Remember that when you're talking about Utd signings
I love this show all of them are what you want professional footballers to be you feel like their normal people that u can relate to
Unwatchable when they all shout across each other.
Love this show but it’s becoming unwatchable/unlistenable because of too many moments where everyone’s talking over each other.
The season we won the league (Leicester) Ranieri promised he’d buy all the players pizza when we kept our first clean sheet. He did- but he took them to a place where they had to make their own together.  Likewise, after we lost to Arsenal (a) in the last minute, he gave them all a full week off to do as they pleased (most went Copenhagen) to give them a week to let off steam.  Man management as its finest
Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Gandhi, Wrighty !
Garys coping talk about Man utd is hilarious.
great show
Great guy wrighty.  loveable person to be and have around. however he does seem to be pandering to others opinion a lot.  maybe to feel liked or appreciated{which i doubt cos he's a natural} but he needs be able to say what he feels without the fear of seeming off-ish or odd.     He probably don't see it or has gone too far in pandering that it's a norm for him now.  again, it doesn't take away from his brilliance, however he does it alot.  even his criticism is subtle. common sir!
😁😁😄wa lol
That liverpudlian will be a pundit soon
Bookmark this FatNev... Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Villa my top 4... I think Man City will drop off because of the charges and injuries this season... Man Utd to finish lower then 8!
Keano and wrighty ❤
sorry for your losses Wrighty ❤️❤️
Cheers Ghandi 😂😂😂
Carra : i love trackie bottoms!   - living upto scouse stereotypes! 😂😂
Ian Wright is so deluded when it comes to Arsenal lol. Good to see Keane call him out.
Protect Wrighty at all costs,hes an incredible human
Man, Wrighty talking about big Kev and his brother really got me choked up. Love to you Wrighty! ❤
Ryan Reynolds was born in Canada, it is amazing how most people keep saying the two Americans owners of Wrexham, lol!
18:49 roys like ahhhh they'll deffo win the league 🤣🤣🤣
Gary Neville's knowledge on football is poor. He just says a load of BS and hopes hee gets 1 right.....
felt that Ian talking about his bro love from Ireland 🇮🇪 ❤
Roy’s birthday lasted a long time…
Godbless you Wrighty
Aberdeen vs real madrid 83 Cup winners Cup final. Ferguson invited his mentor former celtic and Scotland manager jock stein to travel with the team and he brought a bottle of Johnny walker whisky with him. He said to Ferguson give this to the real Madrid manager alfredo di stefano as stein knew he had a taste for it as he gave di stefano the same gift when celtic played real Madrid in his testimonial in 1967 1 week after celtic won the European Cup. Di stefano thought Aberdeen were just greatful to be in the final and he underestimated them. Aberdeen won. That's where Ferguson learned his mind games from
No wonder Gary never made a good manager 😂
Why dont they just put their own scores on the board, watching that lad do it is painful
Roy always have different point of view😂
About 5 sugars them 2 scoops u tried hiding wrighty🤣
Feel your pain Ian. I lost my Da and my sister and 3 other really close family members since October. The pain is raw you'll get through it man. Stick to football is a very welcome distraction every week I'm very grateful for at the moment. Great work lads. GGMU🇾🇪🍻
Aston Villa disregarded by pundits as per usual.
Roy has a go in every episode at Gary but if anyone else had a go at Gary Roy would trounce them
Wrighty's the angel on the shoulder and Keano's the devil 😂
The mindless banter js boring. Stick to the analysis.
Reason why i missed cara he and garry are so funny 😂😂
Is it 30 year old daughter or 13 year old daughter??
Carra is such a knobhead when he speaks about man united, and then speaks like a schoolboy about liverpool, worst pundit ive ever seen after sounness
Tipping Man U for top 4, we (WHU) with our new seasons have a far superior squad.
Hmmmm Roy needs to settle down a bit, getting on my tits a bit also some are trying to make some great points but it’s far too noisy with them shouting over each other…calm down!
Bring Aly Dia to talk about why did you lie about George Weah
Was hoping you might discuss some other teams in the Premier League.
....Love the ending from Roy... 'Oh, here we go!' 😂😂
Wrighty ❤ hit me in the feels
Predictions made here are blind sighted
Cinabit Alvarez what business that is hahahaha.
Gaz gets a hard time from these guys behind the scenes 😂
Good to see the old crew back
Great show and good to have Cara back.
Carra knows Gary is talking nonsense about Uniteds team/formation and he just gave up 😅
We love you wrighty!
Unfortunate for the Oscar Bob shout as he just got injured today
The bit where roy calls wrighty gandhi 🤣🤣
Nev is high. Mainoo is the only Man U midfielder who'd compete with Szoboszlai or Mac Allister at Liverpool.
Roy the wind up merchant starting the season strong 😅
I thought one of them would be singing "hang the dj".
When are we getting a Sir Alex and Roy reunion on the overlap?  Surely Gary can build the bridge?
Love Wrighty but sometimes he is tooooo Arsenal.
What does Ian call Gary? Cos he's not saying Gary and I can't work it out. I've only ever heard Gaz as an alternative to Gary 😂
The panel channeling their inner Clayton Blackmore. Looking so tanned and healthy.
Wrighty is such a hype man haha. "go on gal"
Jamie cracked me up "I'll tell you what Roy, put your other fingers on it"!!!
Pity carragher returned it was great until then
Gary talking about casimiro like he has something to offer 🤦‍♂️  He’s slow as fk
Why is Carra so aggressive when ANYTHING regarding United is brought on the table for discussion? Somebody needs to tell him to tone down and let the United people at least say what they want to. He doesn't let Gary complete ONE SENTENCE about United's midfield 4 when Mount was injured for a big chunk of time and Mainoo wasn't playing until November.
Keane's grumpy negativity once very funny is getting a bit tiresome now.
Have to wait for another week now... :/
Cara is funny to be fair 😂
I love Roy but when he goes off it’s like a CHAMPAGNE CORK 😂 nuts.
wow 10 minutes of actual football talk gees thanks 👍
So Sorry to hear Ian wright has lost his brother I know how this feels Condolences to you and your family and your mate Kevin Campbell
CAAAAALM DOOOOOOWWWWN! My God Carragher gets so triggered when Gary Neville opens his mouth about United...
Sending good thoughts Wrighty.
Roy's such a legend getting a napkin only for him and Wrighty 🤣 he thought the others can feck themselves and get their own
You can see Gary worried he forgot his Birthday lol
Carragher acts like a teenager his so annoying Rooney is miles better for the show
Stop talking over each other!
18:51
Wrighty ❤
You lot made Wrighty self-conscious about the sugar he takes😂
I love the positivity on this show. Looking forward to enjoying the season with you all!
2:44 I was only messing about the sugar, Wrighty! Those sugar dispensers are useless!
The behind the scenes thing is such a cringe 'omg theyre just like us' thing
Where carra ???
Funny how wrighty said a bit like how man city do it with a quality smaller squad. Arsenal are copying the same style of football buying city players and now he wants to copy the squad size. Basically copy copy copy until you can win then say your better.   Hilarious.
“He never did that with me!” 😂
Before the 09 UCL final Pep played the players a video to motivate them and show them their journey.   Ended up being too emotional and messed with the players heads. First 15 mins they were shocking.
srry carra i love u loads BUT!!! i got to say u can be so negative at liverpool, at preseason we looked really good and i just hate when everyone criticise everything.
Every single one of them are class act 🙌🏻
Nice to see that Roy properly chilled out on his holiday 🤭
Lost all respect there with the Newcastle result, first game of the season last season they beat Villa 5-1 and now they start the season with a loss to Southampton? Interesting.
Pundits: 1) Spurs are so open , they won’t be in top4  2) Villa will be in top4  Reality: Spurs & Villa both conceded 61 PL goals… and Spurs had to play 4 full backs in back line for 1/3rd of season. Spurs aren’t losing their best players but adding more depth in fwd(Son Richy Solanke scored 47 goals last season)…
Arsenal or Adidas 😂😂 Classic!
Gary complaining  about been back early didint have much of a break relax you're sitting in a studio drinking tea talking about football you're not doing a 12hr night-shift in a factory
Roy is Gary's Dad and Wrighty is Gary's mum.
Jamie is instigator of the year
Love the podcast and the energy, but there was so much overtalking in the background, this show in particular. Missed so much because of it, just wondering if they will address that.
Absolutely love Roy getting involved and winding Jamie up … school boy error!’
Carra > Rooney
Shocks of the season,.... all centred around the top 6 give over
Roy is funny… and lovable… but his tone and face are pained in every single response to Gary. 😂
Gary Neville thinks Man Utd and Tottenham finish above Liverpool. 😂😂😂
More delusional takes on Man U. Really spoils this show when they fail to properly appraise Man U; there’s absolutely no way they finish above Liverpool and will likely finish 5th or 6th.
Love these guys but it’s mental how much the pundits are sleeping on Newcastle, even to the point they think Southampton will beat them on the opening day. I’m saying Newcastle top 4.
I love that Ciaran lad at the start
My top 6 1. Man city  2. Liverpool  3. Arsenal  4. Chelsea  5. Villa  6. Spurs
Shock of the season United win the treble
😂😂wright I saw how much sugar you put there
Thinking of you Wrighty in there difficult times. I just lost a friend to Leukemia after a long battle. Funeral was yesterday. Grieving is a journey, hang in there fella.
This is the best show on any platform.
The giant raspberry mini roll is a perfect birthday cake for Roy 😃👍
1:04:54 Well thats out the window now hes broken his leg
Very Sorry for your loss ian never easy loosing loved ones 🙏💚
Keane Grinchier than usual.
Juventus played a 3-5-2 with 3 CM, not 4. Pirlo, pogba, Vidal. Marchisio was swapped in and out
What a great episode again, keep them coming 👏👏👏
Fans come and pay to watch the players . It is not there fault the money is good. I'd rather the footballers pocket that money than the board members .
Here for you Wrighty! Rest in peace to them both 😢😢
Sending love Wrighty ❤
Love how Roy and Carra have Gnez sussed. Proper politician PR vibes tryna be down with the kids 😭
There's a lot of people talking over each other in this episode.
Love u wrighty! National legend! You appeal to all cultures. We love u bro! Thank u overlap best podcast and panel!
The way Carragher questioning Gary about his predictions...  I remember clearly someone said there was absolutely no chance United will win the FA cup.
Carra is more passionate when talking about united than Liverpool the prat
Cara so intelligent in football terms he’s like Google brilliant.
stay strong wrighty bhoy
I prefer the bit before they start the show.
Whoever makes the time stamps should do a better job. 50 minutes of Roy Keane's birthday cake?
Carra showing he's still a sad act. Couldn't resist mentioning united at every opportunity!
Every year these clowns predict United to finish in top 4 Underrating teams that are better than them
it's chaos
my feelings are with you Wrighty 🖤 sorry for your loss..blessings to the fam Mr Ian ‘Not Ghandi’
Ian wright , my commiserations for your loss and I can absolutely identify. I love to see the deep respect shown by the others as he spoke about his loss. Talk about this more on these platforms
Wrighty getting emotional had me emotional. What a strong man, we wish you nothing but happiness Wrighty.
So typical of a man from South London, to be so defensive of that's areas finest 😂 Coys.
Gary will forever.. without a doubt.. be anti Liverpool.. always
Carra's toon changed when talking about Liverpool....  Piss off ya that, keep the same energy
Carragher is an absolute comedian his reactions are hilarious
Give Garry a break bro
Love Wrighty!!
Agree with carra, villa have no chance of top 4 with CL football and Luiz gone
Keep wazza sit free he be out of work soon enough 😂
Can't listen to Carra man, just such an annoying personality
Neville’s voice and laugh is getting squeakier and squeakier!
My Premier League predictions 24/25:  1. Man City 2. Arsenal 3. Liverpool 4. Newcastle United 5. Tottenham Hotspur 6. Manchester United 7. Aston Villa 8. Chelsea 9. West Ham 10. Crystal Palace 11. AFC Bournemouth 12. Wolverhampton Wanderers 13. Everton 14. Brighton & Hove Albion 15. Brentford 16. Fulham 17. Ipswich Town 18. Nottingham Forest 19. Leicester City 20. Southampton
The way Neville overates Utd players is crazy lol.
united could have signed Osimhen this season. I wonder why they didnt try to sign him
Lmao .... Roy Keane is the god of these... Just a bunch of people that played now as mates just chilling having a laugh...people calling wrighty ghandi lol
Cheers Ghandi
Love the fit of Cara t-shirts. What brand is that?
Shaw was ment to come on but he got injured on way 🤕
Can someone explain to me the new champions league format? will they be more games?
11:53 14:05 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where’s Wayne Wazza Rooney today 😧
ghandi quality from keano
Back with an absolute bang!
Gandhi 😂😭
Why did Carra come back? The show runs smoother without him
On 32:28 Someone definitely let one rip, I’m blaming Wrighty
Love Roy
Juve had Pogba, Marchisio, Pirlo, Vidal in midfield. They went a league season unbeaten
The show is taken up a few levels with Carragher on. Brilliant as always.
get ian out of the studio for f*** sake
I hope Wrighty got lots of hugs after holding it together about his tough summer.
Nevs utd team hahahaha
31:26 boringhell 😴
Carragher back with his sir Alex and Man Utd slander as per usual
Neville was so average
My favourite ❤❤ having some wine watching the new episode ❤happy birthday roy 🎉
So sorry to hear about your losses Ian. Hang in there big man. <3
@IanWright0 Wrighty has such High EQ & his Empathy for 'Millie' was Beautiful to see👏🙏🕺❣ #goodluckmillie 🏃‍♀
God bless Ian Wright ❤
Love Wrighty, such a genuine bloke . stay strong Bro
Great  show
This is becoming unlistenable when they are all talking at the same time. Whoever is holding the croissant can talk 🥐
Roy’s disdain at Gary for getting on stage. 😂😂
We had Stevie Wonder in goal 😂
Great show
Oscar bob fractured a bone in his leg. shame
1:04:54 worst prediction ever , just broke his leg
This was so much better without Carragher. Please make future considerations for this fantastic show. Adults to toddlers!!
Love this show😂
One conversation at a time it's impossible to listen
Happy birthday Roy 🎉🎈🎉
Jamie’s football memory and Gary Neville Pundit memory is some serious Beautiful Mind stuff
Football is back ❤
What a start from Keano!!  It's already a legendary episode 😂😂 5:39
Roy JESUS Keane 😂
I enjoyed the Olympics a lot more than the Euros and football is my no.1. Something about watching these athletes, many you haven’t heard of just being on the edge of something incredible or soul destroying like a race or an opportunity at a lifelong dream like an Olympic medal, and these people are not handsomely paid like footballers are. There’s just something so raw and truly sporting when watching it all.
Neville and Carragher hate anything negative being said about United or Liverpool
Chelsea vs man city.. 2-2
Great show 👏
Gary Neville saying Liverpool won’t get top 6 is probably one of the worst football takes to come out of his mouth
That was the worst one yet, everyone just talking over each other.... Just a load of noise and completely shite.
Gary saying liverpool not getting top 6 hahahaha
Sleeping on villa again….watch what happens.
Rodri will be player of the year, Newcastle will finish 4th and win the league cup
1:17:03 Roy Keane man 😂😂
52:00 Pogba, Pirlo, Marchisio, Vidal
Powerful stuff from Wrighty. Amongst all the laughs it’s sobering to see a real moment like that where somebody just lays everything out on the table
Rooney should be a regular guest
Ian telling Gary to take no notice 🤣
Man City won't win a 5th - Pep & the squad will be more focused on the CL and the energy the unprecedented 4th took cost them the CL and probably the FA Cup as well... Whoever tops Arsenal wins the League But this season has a lot of imponderables - Newcastle look stronger and they've no european football, Villa have strengthened but will a debut CL and a domestic cup being the only realistic trophy target cost them in the league? Liverpool, Man Utd, Arsenal or Newcastle to win the League, Man City to finish 3rd or 4th but they'll win the CL. Spurs will get 5th but will win the Europa League. England get 5 CL places for 2025/26
30 mins in.....right, let's start the show! 😂😂
The full gang are back?!! ❤
Really loved that sir Alex set up the players with other trials when he released them, all top clubs and academy’s should do this
This was so enjoyable. Good to have Jamie back.Ian is so thoughtful.
Speaking over each other way too much in this episode
She's a dose
PLEASE stop talking over each other. All I can hear is blah blah blah bah
why do they always try and belittle gary? i don't care if you call it "banter" have a bit of respect for the man. it's weird to watch. you can see the glee on jamie's face when it's happening. he's a bully. feels like watching high school kids. grow up.
RIP Kevin Campbell Bluebirds legend 🐦and Wightys’s brother
Safe to say I definitely did not miss Cara on this show.
love you Wrighty! <3
Wrighty 💙💙💙
Carra love him or hate him knows his stuff
Keane and Carra came with both barrels loaded to this one😅😅
Also condolences to Ian Wright 🙏
Turning 40 in a couple of months time. Been a lifelong United supporter, I’d love to meet Roy Keane. Absolute legend and for me, the best pundit around currently. Always thought he was such a serious guy but watching him more and more on shows like this makes you realise how funny he is as well. Keep up the great content guys 👌😊
At 34.10 mins in.. What about construction workers or anybody doing heavy physical work 10 or 12 hours a day that get 2 weeks of at xmas and 2 weeks off in the summer??  Why should we feel sorry for these millionaires that get paid hundreds of thousands to do something they love and is a hobby for the normal person !
you can feel Garys hatred towards Liverpool
“I only had two sugars”
Sorry for your trouble Ian
Give it a rest Roy 😅
Biggest surprise Crystal Palace will qualify for Europe by winning the Carabo Cup
Why do these man get hyped when it comes to talking about united. Calm down Cara
Love you lot, but my lord speak about different teams ffs. So boring hearing about Man Utd, Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal. Clubs like Aston Villa, West Ham and others has blown all the above out the water with transfers. Talk about the promoted teams etc.
Class!!!
villa will struggle with CL and PL manager might , players dont
Love this  The first five minutes brilliant  Bunch of mates taking the piss
Seriously   Gary you look so tired . Please take some time out
Ødegaard, Haaland, Bobb. Let's go Norway.
Ian is an empath its as simple as that
They don't run em anymore in pre season and there isn't much running off the ball anymore
I love this content, it’s loose, raw, nothing fancy, no special effects, editing just like having our with your mates at a pub
Carra is so knowledgeable, he adds something to the show.
Best start ever, man this is so wholesome, laughing along with them...
Watch at 49.40 seconds. Gary Neville saying ”Hmm…not sure” absolute comedy gold and it needs clipping up.
Ian Wright is a national treasure. Seeing him talk so honestly and openly about his recent bereavements is a lesson to us all in humility and humanity.  God bless you Wrighty.
Honestly didn't realize how much i missed carragher, it's the Scouse Spice we needed, although tbf I do love Wayne, it's just Carragher tends to light things up, we do need him
Simply the best footy show, way better than MOTD.
Best thing on the internet 🙌🏽
Uncle Ian I beg you relax with the sugar man hahaha rartid uncs.
Roy second is last winners mind  set even at forty three happy birthday Mr Keane 🎂
Any Liverpool guests from the time Roy was playing like Jason Macc, Steve mcmanamon robbie fowler I know I’ve just butchered all of them names 😂 any changes guys
32:25 sounds like someone let's one rip
Give Gary a break
Ian Wright is a wonderful human being.
"Do people ever forget your birthday, Roy?" lmao jamie is an instigator
Bobb out for a few now
Unfortunately today it is come out that oscar bob  has badly broken his leg in training in a non-contact situation on the turn in a crossing drill.
united are so irrelevant, yet they yap on like we care
Imagine they do a league of their own style challenges and Roy and Wrighty have to do synchronised swimming 😂😂
If you're born in the 70/80s and love football this is the best show on the internet
City United Arsenal Tottenham
Felt for Wrighty there, didn't realise he had lost his brother 😢  Love this show but got to say there was too much talking over one another in this episode. It was hard to pick up all that was being said!   Dont think the other teams like Spurs, Villa and Newcastle were discussed as top 4 candidate's. Somebody will suprise!   I think Liverpool will challenge City more than Arsenal and Man Utd. Just a feeling.
17:23 HELLA PAUSES HERE WRIGHTY! 🤣💀💀
Premier League Predictions and its 25 mins in and there has been zero football talk 🥴
the birthday song is the worst song ever, i hear it im outa there.. dear god lol
Gary: First thing, birthday wishes for Roy Roy: Why? 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂 1:22:32
Love how Roy looked more angry with Gary for suggesting he went to Luton vs Burnley then he did for Gary forgetting his birthday 🤣
Utd top 3 😂😂😂😂 clueless Liverpool won’t win the league and I’ll be happy with top 4 for new manager. But they will be miles ahead of utd again
Really enjoy watching this. Best out the bunch. Good crack.
Gary talking about the united midfield and completely dosregarding rashford, zirksee, garnacho, diallo, where are the goals meamt to come from??
OH HERE WE GO 😂😂😂😂😂
the prediction segment was the funniest
Love to Wrighty, man. Told fella
Painful to listen to. Loud, too many talking at once, shouting and talking over each other with Charragher's squeaking added into the mix
AHH come on now , predicting the relegation zone is now negativity....smh 😢
I can honestly say this is the first episode where I've been genuinely annoyed with one of the cast. Roy Keane, I love you mate, but fuckinell you're a negative Nancy sometimes. Get a hug man seriously.
That a great ending to be fair ❤
18:38 Roy Being Honest 😂😂😂
Ian wright is a real man . A Real , real man. 💪 Emotional master .man had a tough life and still has the softest most gentle of hearts .thats true Manlihood .
Gees Gary gets given a tough time, good to have Wrighty there
Ian Wright is an absolute KING 👑
Brilliant episode ❤ yet again ….nice to see Cara, return…..looking forward to the new season ⚽️ of The Overlap
An hour dedicated to Keane's birthday?
Roy Keane is a national, international, global, universal treasure and must must must be protected at all costs.
Happy birthday Roy 🎁🎉 Great show today guys. All the best from Torquay.. Wayne Rooneys Plymouth Argyle won against Torquay a few weeks ago 😅
Sympathies to Wrighty for his losses over summer ❤ Stay strong Ian
Did they mention Newcastle once?
Putting 4 sugurs and not even stirring the bastsrd...wrighty???
Ipswich are so underrated
They are often ALL talking at once, but that makes it more REAL……
Will you still be doing punditry in the next 10 years??  Absolutely FOOKIN not! 😂
1.13.03 wtfs going on loool
Cantona on the show would make my year! 7
Been in exactly the same place as wrighty cracking show as always and banter but that little moment with Ian about his brother fair play I don’t talk about my brother or my loss enough grieving etc but that hit me fair play Ian all the best 🥲👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Keane talking about United, about to talk about Mount and Carragher starts mouthing out of him and cuts Keane out..... Mouthy Gobshite
The Roy wink after the trials comment 😂😂
Wright has such a great personality, seems like he would be a good mate
Ciaran is basically Roy’s description of what physios are in football teams…
Not really a season review talking about 4 teams
Oscar Bobb :((
This show was so good without Carragher...
I bet Carragher can't believe he's still got a job 🤮
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Get a chelsea city pundit in there as well now. Representation of United, arsenal and Liverpool has been so long and same just add some new opinions into the content
Absolutely blew my mind that Arteta has been at arsenal for 5 year.
Roy just loves picking on Gary to be fair 🤣
Poor Gary .. gets hammered
It should be Sir Ian Wright.  He's a national treasure.
You guys should have had a month's break before the new season. What bro!?!
26:22 if he could've smoked he would've won!
Is it just me or does the show not need Cara?
Carra talks all the time about liverpool but gets so annoyed when others talk about their club not missed him one bit
LOVE THIS SHOW!!!
Fecking hell, can someone let them know there’s more than 4 or 5 teams in the league? 😂
After the opening salvo from Roy at Gary I felt like I’d just watched the class geek getting bullied. In a softer, middle aged tea fuelled way. With mini rolls.
Carra better than Rooney on here tbf.
All of you talking/shouting at the same time is just noise.
Carra is irreplaceable. Glad to have him back.
I get Roy's points: 1. Pressing play isn't "DJ'ing" and 2. People didn't pay to go see Gary Neville on stage... But him or someone else pressing play doesn't exactly change a lot!
The Romford Pele would be a great addition to this table, might have to be in the wb though 🍻
Gary is so scared of Roy 😂😂😂😂
The gang back together just feels right.  I am sorry for your loss, Wrighty.
Everyone sleeps on United.. we are coming.. 😉
Roy was in a shite mood and picked on Gary. Unfair imoc
Rough episode
"Arsenal or Adidas" got me good that Roy
Let’s get John Terry and Wayne Bridge on next
Gary and Roy’s friendship is like best of mates.  Hope everyone sees that
No matter what club you support we all love Wrighty!
Thank god no Wazza on here.
Why do the British talk over each other 😭
Brilliant episode, as ever never disappoints good see the gang back 👌🔥
“Just watch, like normal people” - that is my favourite side of Roy, say it as it is……..
Arne slot will be the Bob paisley to klopps shankly
Neville needs to calm down jesus
Just about to watch. Wonder if Roy will do a yaya
Happy birthday Sir Roy
❤ Wrighty
Slagging United off for finally having some squad depth with some quality, get a grip
Glad too see carra back
Wright ive Only had two sugars😂
Anybody else not have a clue what they were saying when GN asked about the Burnley doc, and everyone started explaining it together 😮😂😂😂
United old boys club schtick getting old
The Turkish shooting guy, Yusuf Dikec, won gold at the competitions World Cup in 2011 and he's always been shooting with no gear. He just prefers it. Also the hand in the pocket is just like one of the standard positions so he wasn't just nonchalant 😭
1 Arsenal 2 Liverpool 3 Man City (point deduction) 4 Villa 5 Man Utd 6 Newcaslte 7 Tottenham 8 Chelsea
Does anyone exist outside these teams ...it's getting boring isn't it ?
He’s definitely got a point about going on stage with Tim burgess and famous people, I thought that was a bit weird when Eminem was holding Terrence Crawford belt.  101 this shite 😂
These lot are the best things about the football season!!!!
I love Roy Keane, he’s hilarious usually but he definitely was going too far with the concert thing. He certainly ruffled feathers on this show
We all love Uncle Ian 😊
They are talking over each other far too much, I'm trying to listen while working and I can't decipher what is being said during too much of the show.  PRODUCERS - sort it out
Worst episode so far. Arrogance has set in. It sounds like rowdy train carriage rabble. With no one worth listening to. It’s been better, so much better.
1 hour talking about a birthday cake, then 10 mins of all the predictions jammed in lmao
Best football podcast
Leave Gary alone. He’s lovely.
if you are all talking at thesame time, bit likethe kids shouting at each other no one hears a f--king thing!
Love you Wrighty ❤
Roy's not really pissed off that GN forgot his birthday...honestly
Great first episode,good ave jamie on,good mix of different ex players..great banter, wayne b available soon lol
All the best to Wrighty, a truly lovely fella 💔
Still no conversation about the euro final or have I missed something
Stick to Football 🤣
Laughter is the best medicine.
Not a word out of carragher until Utd are the topic and neville is speaking,  then carragher starts havin his usual meltdown and the blood pressure goes through the roof  🤦🏼‍♂️ absolutely obsessed 😂😂
the look of absolute scorn and disgust on roy's face when thinking of gary on stage enjoying himself is just gold,the chemistry this group have is tremendous especially when compared to left wing lineker,cackling micah and dour shearer
These new premier league rules are a joke. All of the refs need to be given the least amount of power so they cannot affect the game.
Roy Keane ... what a guy !! Wrightly just want to give him a hug
Second is last , Roy Keane 👌
Write Liverpool off at your own peril
Roy was in a bit of a mood today
Fight on millie
Love Wrighty great guy
Ben deserves the medal of patience
Arsenal lost the league when we bottled it over the Xmas period.  Drawing and winning against the big team doesn't hurt as much as that crucial part in the league ... 😅
Neville is feeling really bullied in this first 20 mins. Like when he was a player 😂
Let me guess, they're gonna repeat the same talking points about Chelsea being "scatter gun" and somehow Gary is gonna justify United finishing above Chelsea even tho last season we finished above United
Wrighty talking about how losing family and friends catches you after it has happened, sometime after is so true, and it can be the smallest thing that can catch you and the grief is there but few understand ❤
Kieran looks so much like Alexis MacAllister, and I've never seen them both in the same room
The mannequin jibe by Roy 😂😂
"Get a mannequin in, itll be the same" - Roy with the harsh truths 🤣
Looking forward to the TRUE northern team to finish above Man U.
these are experts more like a comedy club lol united above liverpool lol
biggest love to you, Mr Wright
18:50
We need Neil Razor Ruddock on this show, if only to watch him eat every croissant, every pan au chocolat, every mini roll, and then have a row with Wrighty. It would be Overlap gold.
@41:00 I echo Carra's comment regarding people say some players are not good but they are only on the pitch for 10mins. Eddie especially.
I bet Gary wouldn't have forgotten Tim Burgesses birthday 😂
Roy Keane is my idol 🙏🏻
Leave Garry alone Roy 🤣
Okay a poll people. Sugar in tea?? Yes or no?? Thumbs or down
Why does Carra get so riled up over united🤣
I don't know, this might be  getting a  bit  old, same  chat all  the time, football  is gone  boring, the Olympics  was a  refreshing  change  from the  same  predictable  premier  league
Cheers gandhi😂😂
Keane is such a character, and he knows it. I LOVE Wrighty. I'm a Gooner. Carragher is carragher. He knows a lot about footy. I hate to say it, but Neville is the boss and happy to take shots. A boss taking grief, being able to laugh it off and continue the show. He's a little different, G.Nev. That hurts to say.
“Gandhi” 😂😂 Roy Keane is quality 🤣
This is the best pod cast. Luv it❤
If Roy was Nev’s big brother or dad. He will keep hitting him at everything he does. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
💓💓💓
Shut up and let Roy speak.
As soon as united gets mentioned jamie starts with that squeaky voice he'd do your head in
Love the insight and insults. So good.
Lmao Neville is so deluded. Liverpool finished 22 points ahead of Man United last season, of course they'll be in the top 4, come on Gary...
Gary has dementia
Oh wrighty I wish I could give you a big hug pal ❤
This show is easily best of the week. So glad it is back!!!
long time stamp on roy's cake eh hahahaha
Thoughts with you wrighty ❤❤
Best podcast of all time tbh, I’ve always liked podcasts but never religiously followed like I’d miss some episodes here na there but with this one I’m checking damn near every few days, lol even tho I have the bell notifications on.
No one gets to Neville not even Keane but as soon as Carra starts the wind up that high pitched wail of Nev’s kicks into overdrive
Roy keane is propper bitter lol can't take the fact that young managers are doing jobs he could NEVER do the out of date dinosaur
Wrighty what a man
18:14 Sorry to be a knobhead and all that, nbut Ryan Reynolds is Canadian..Actually, I'm not sorry. Being a knobhead is what I do best.
Condolences to Wrighty and family 🙏🏽 ❤️💛💚
How many times does Sherga have to tell this story?? This is the fourth time she's told this tale! Boring
Wrighty ❤❤❤
What a guy wrighty is. All the love to the big man. 😢
We need more like Ian Wright in the World Top Geezer is that lad. cheers guys loved it.
All the best to Wrighty <3
DJ Gary's midlife crisis.
1:17:00 ouch
Man city and Bayern literally both have had recent documentary series about them 😂😂
Gary is too biased when it comes to Liverpool and Manu.
Stay strong Wrighty❤
I LOVE Keano....No nonsense guy
Pep will.leave before the charges are brought in to save face Man Cheaty 115 lets go
Slagging spurs off before a ball been kicked 😆😆
Roy is hands down best guy on any platform funny as fuk 😂 😂
Love the banter which is why I watch -but - you'd think the premier league is only composed of 4 teams according to this lot. They rarely even talk about villa or spurs let alone all the other clubs in the league ...
Zubimendi already said he wanted to join LFC but his family didn’t want to come. No embarrassment or looking bad on the recruiting team. Just the way it is.
So much better with carra on 👌🏼
Carra is such a tadger, His voice goes through you. Squeaky scouser.
BIGGEST SURPRISE CITY TO WIN LEAGUE........ THEN GET RELEGATED!! 😉
Keeeeaaanoooo😂🤣Gary's getting slaughtered but supported by Gandhi.
Wrighty does look a bit like Gandhi 😂
Wrighty needs a shovel for his sugar 😂
Red rum club are brilliant btw 😊
Feel like a new signing hahaha
"Get pep out" 😅
Jamie's inability to understand maybe some players don't want to move to Liverpool will always make me laugh
Need to know where Ian gets his glass frames from?
Do they speak about England in this episode or is that skipped?
How many liverpool players wanted to play for klopp and failed   Keita number 1 beast at RB and was Gerrards replacement 😂
21:27 - 1 of the 3 names in the ✉️ was Steven Gerrard. Slip -> Demba Ba ⚽️
Ian Wright, he knows what the British public are like, oi, Teddy Ghandi, you alright mate.😂😂😂😂😂
Big love to Wrighty, talk about how to show up and be a man. What an example he is to anyone struggling and dealing with grief or just not having a zest for life. Watched every episode of the Overlap since the show started and for me that there is the best moment for the show. The guy always shows up and wants to bring positive energy. Only one Wrighty
Being quite on Starmer Gary. You helped him get in, now look, he's created the thought police.
Wrighty always hypes everyone up, when they try/do something new or different 😊
as much i hate Carra and he is so off about many things he is so spot on about Luke Shaw. HE AINT GONNA STAY FIT. buy a left back for starter not backup he is done 4 years now
Not good from Keane here, getting paid a fortune for talking about football and all he can say is how much of a nuisance it is, (it’s your job Roy)
Utd won’t finish top 6
These five have the perfect balance. Love the Overlap!
The Juventus 4 Gary referred to a few times was Pirlo, Marchisio, Vidal and Pogba I believe 51:00
We need Ugarte
Man u were lucky to finish 8th last season so the idea that they will finish in top 4 this season is laughable
Been really good lately but this one was a bit too shouty. Everybody talking over each other and Keane doing his Victor Meldrew on steroids impersonation! Make some hash cakes next week!
I thought Cara was talking on x2
Pep will leave the second citeh are charged
Still the best show
Neville on the stage.. What a prat
Big up wrighty ❤
I don't think the people are bothered about football when those same people are being abused by the government you can't have football without the people you guys should use your platform to help your own people or sorry forget you can only take knees for blm and support lgbtquxyz the people aren't stupid enough is enough are you with the people or against them it's time for you lot the stand up
Why do people have to BLASPHEME???????
“Tell you what Roy put your other fingers on it” 😂😂😂
Keano love you but let garry vibe you bully😅
No one at the festival knew why he was there..
The Keane + Gandhi show
47:45 Shaw is injured already 😂
45:00 min Manchester United
Sending Love and Strength to Wrighty, We are all with you Brother
I am surprised how outdated a lot of people are about studying what United is planning to do, tbh, the plan is still in the flux, it can sharply change in coming weeks depending on the transfer window. If the couple of targets get transferred, the United setup can make a complete switch to a compact counter press structure with split forwards.
Sorry Wrighty,  XXX
This is truly the best channel on tube, look forward every week. The dynamic is awesome between them all.🎉😊
Carragher needs to be in every episode. The show is so much better with him on it (not that it isn’t great already). Carragher should also get a pay raise for his hard work.
1:22:45 Roy winking😂😂😂
cant stand listening to Carragher in this, he spoils the programme for me
Strange that I'm looking forward to this seasons overlap more than the matches 😂 then again i support Chelsea 😅
Jamie talks about Liverpool everyone lets him talk  Garry talks about United and he just jumps down his throat    Not missed him on the channel at all
There is my Carra… i struggle to watch the show when there is no Carra
We all love Wrighty cos he wears his heart on his sleeve, he is passionate and emotional and like any great striker he wanted to score unbelievable goals and he had the balls to try and pull them off. What a man 👊
We love you Wrighty 🖤♥️  Hope you manage to get through such a difficult time swiftly. Never easy losing someone.  The friendship between him and Roy is so awesome to see.
I used to enjoy the first 10 mins of casual talk, but I can’t take half an hour of it, especially when the timestamps aren’t accurate 😂
Roy Keane's Birthday Cake is listed as almost an hour. What happens there?!
Belter of an opener!
Kevin and Perry 😂
Fire hazard Gary…. Genius
48:37 Carra sounding like Pingu 🤣🤣
Worst show ever. An hour spent on Roy Keane's birthday, just fast forwarded to last 20 minutes. Man Utd top four and Liverpool not getting in top six shows these fools have lost the plot.
Teddy Gandhi!😂 thats Gold!!😂😂🏅🏅🥇🥇
Love Roy keanes comments😂😂😂
So sorry for your loss Wrighty. Stay strong!
The difference between slot coming to Liverpool after klopp and the other managers they listed after a successful manager, like moyes after fergie and emery after wenger, is that slot playing style is similar to klopp with pressing aggression...the other manager had none of those like their predecessors
Is it just me of do these guys know very little outside their utd city liverpool and arsenal bubble?
Sorry for your loss Wrighty some hard days ahead ❤
Gary is a top lad.
Didn’t really miss Carra at all….obnoxious
Roy seemed pissed of today 😂😂😂
Please subtitle Jamie. Cant understand a word out of his mouth.
Really felt for wrighty there he just seems like a top bloke a good friend always has a smile and to see him struggling hit me right in the feels hope your ok mate we all love you ❤
No Ipswich v Liverpool prediction
Really enjoy this show.  Only thing is that there are too many times that you're all talking at the same time and we can't make anything out.  If you could cut down on that it would be top, top, top!
"Liverpool won't finish in the top four/six", but "Man Utd will finish third". 🤦
Cole Palmer will be player of season
‘Anything Arsenal or Adidas’….. ☠️☠️😭😂
Roy fuming with Gary from the off 😆
Top 4 will be: Arsenal City Chelsea United
Is it type 1 or 2 diabetes that Ian has? 😂
😂you honestly see why Gary never made it as a coach
Still not noticed the YouTube plaque 😅
I'm starting to get bored of these. Same old same old stuff.
Teddy Gandhi, what a guy
He didnt come to Liverpool because he doesnt want to play for Arne SLOT SLOT SLOT!! 😂😂😂
God sometimes I wonder if Gary actually watches united play? Mount doesn’t and shouldn’t start
Ian making his syrup!
They did that Arteta trick with the Liverpool squad, then asked the pickpockets to check their own pockets and none of the pickpockets had there phones or cash on them
I think we all love the 'organised' chaos! We need subtitles for all 5 of them to keep up 😂 Loving it, put a massive smile on my face each and every time!
Roy won't be booking Gary has a DJ anytime soon 😂
Going to miss Rooney on these. Hopefully he does the odd one now and again.
Did Keane just fart 😂😂
Good to see Carra back!  Stay strong Wrighty
Can we have a 5 aside game against shearer, micah and linekar and co against u lot - put the highlights in show... would luv that!!!!
everyone overtalks wrighty and never listen to him, he's the best pundit on there
Great podcast but too many times you've got people talking over each other and you just get noise and it becomes chaotic.
Gotta say as much as i find Neville annoying, he's almost always thr first one on set. Speaks volumes about his professional attitude. Easy to see how he managed to play so many games for a club like Manchester United.
The arteta thing with the pickpockets , maybe it's an analogy to show players if they don't keep things tight they can have their pockets picked . As in that's what happened last season with man city, arsenal they thought they had it but got pipped at the final hurdle🤔, maybe
I really hope roy is just moaning for comedic effect otherwise he must be a nightmare to be around
Why is it always Liverpool players and fans that are concerned about MU squad and rotation. Then they play dumb and not count the amount of games played, injuries and r/y cards.  Try tellibg Feeguson you have 3 strikers. We had squads with 4 strikes, Cole, Yorke, Solj, Teddy. Rooney, Tevez, Ronaldo etc. MU peaks have always been when they have had 4+ attackers in the squad.L
Nothing against Rooney. I'm delighted to see Carragher back.
Sorry for your loss Wrighty
Keanes act is getting a bit old hat, worn out 🥱 Contrarian to the point of meaninglessness
We all wish we had a friend like Ian, such a positive and inclusive guy
Ian needs a ladle instead of tea spoon.
Where’s Rooney after his 4-0 spanking
I’ll be the fashion police and say Gary’s Prada glasses are 👌🏾
I've never seen anyonne as eager to get on camera as that production guy
lol same old. Only capable of talking about the “big 6”. Wrighty even mentions West Ham and every body goes quiet and doesn’t say anything because they only know about United, Liverpool or Arsenal 🥱
Criest, Keane disagreeing with everything gets a bit repetitive
Gary's commitment is next level. First person in for every podcast as well 😂
I love the overlap but they are always talking over each other .
Roy needs to let things go sometimes, good grief
Klopp's Liverpool never took 4 points off Pep's Man City. Why are Arsenal held to a higher standard?
DJ Jazzy Nev 😂😂😂
Much love to you and your family Wrighty. Stay strong brother.
Jamie gets emotional hate when talking about United
I’d love to have a night at the pub with this crew
Newcastle top 4 Isak player of the season 🎉❤
I like when Gary and Carra become 9 years old
I love how everyone worries about Gary! xx
Roy Keane is the first ex player to say "De Ligt is a good signing"
I love these guys so much. They were missed❤
Oscar Bobb?
Having Man Utd finish ahead of Liverpool by the majority is pretty scandalous. It’s a completely biased opinion.
They were really big spoons of sugar there Ian
What wasn’t discussed was the challenge for Arsenal this season is they probably need to do even better against the top 4 teams to beat City, but I doubt they will win as many points against the top teams this season as they did last season.
Sloth give him time you will win stuff this guys style is entertainment this guy if fans take to him and owners give him time to fill klopps boots
Seb Hutchinson - Stevie Wonder in goal ahahahaha
The surprise will be Fullham top 6
Roy loves it
Spurs and man u ahead of liverpool...Neville and Keane ffs they cant hide they're bias 😅😅😅😅😅😅
How is united a lock for top 4 where as liverpool might finish 7 when united literally finished 8th last season
How is Gary simultaneously saying Liverpool finsh 4th but the surprise of the season is that Liverpool finsh outside of the top 6
You ever seen bielsa murderball in action that's how you close the fine margin imagine bielsa at man  united with there money the man who's protégé is pep look at games Leeds played against city we took points also every time we played them we looked like we could beat them why bielsa doesn't have job offers here baffles me when you see lampard Gerrard Rooney getting job after job this man as england manager with these players last three tournaments would of been won training is next level there's a reason Lionel messi as said he would love to play for this guy before he retires bring Marcelo to your club and messi signs and ends his days at your club and maybe carries on working with youth talk about inspiring that great academy back to winning using youth keeping them not selling like united used to do they've lost that at united
its descended into cacophony
Barry kean red as a lobster 🦞🦞
@GNev2 has to get his guitar rig in there and play it. LOUD!
3:05  Right, so he DID actually dj.. got it..
If Utd get Ugarte they will get top 4
So happy to see Roy got a giant Raspberry mini roll for his bday, yous know him well ❤
Quite chaotic this one. Rowdiness on first day of school. Like your down the pub arguing with your mates. Love it.
At least point Roy Keane is saying things for the "oh isn't roy so funny" Nah, not funny anymore Roy please stop starting stuff to be "controversial"
Villa lose Luis and play in CL and they're getting top 4? Drop me out.
do they talk about de ligt at any point if so at what point, thank you
Got to love Wrighty. Such an honest bloke, intune with his emotions, open to talk about anything (even on camera on something so personal) and always helps raise other people with compliments and pure vibes. What a man.
Roy is such a hater
Never thought ide say this but Ime piss bored of the same faces in the same places talking the same shir
Wrighty didn't see anything from United in the Community Shield? 😂 If all the chances were converted, United wins that 5-2. Outside of the first 30 minutes, United was the better team. There's clearly a system that ETH and the coaches have been working on. Very daft comment from him.
We need a 2 hour special one of these days!
Villa top 4??? You're going mad...
Thoughts are with you Wrighty. Condolences for your loss❤
10:59 I tell you what Roy put your other fingers on it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Think your missing the point of the gaps for utd   Utd have fit faster backline that plays high it lets mainoo and casemiro push with cover
Neville discussing the Manchester United midfield is tragic. We cannot start the season with this midfield.
These multimillionaires complaining about being tired and filming a TV show. Jesus.
1:09:12 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Gary is fed up
I could watch the behind the scenes for hours🤣 don’t even need the football talk could just listen to them chatting 💩 about everyday life🤣
So much better without Carra, back to fast forward when his gob opens.
How do you watch this and not just smile and laugh along?? Love it! Looking forward to another season! Spread love all
Guys, nice one really enjoyed it. 👏👏.
Poor Gary. He tries so hard then gets destroyed in seconds of everyone’s arrival
Wrighty & Keano are my new fav double act 😂⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
1:17:05 ‘WE’D GET A MANNEQUIN IN, IT WOULD BE THE SAME’ 😂😂😂
At 3:45 when Roy is quizzing Gary about how well he knows the DJ, if he’d of asked him if he knows when his birthday was I’d of died🤣 he tee’d it up perfectly
How does everyone miss that United's midfield looked open because the defensive line was so deep?
Well Gary jinxed Luke shaw 😂 he’s out for start of season already typical
Don't get💉💉
17:28 Big Pause Ian
Newcastle truly are the most slept on team this season.
So many people sleeping on Newcastle this year , i think we can  get 4th this year with no european football , Tonali like a new signing and squad not crippled with injuries like last year
Ehhhh theres so many ego's in the room at 1 time
😂😂
Roy is not having the dj’ing
Roy keane legend
Keane roasting Gary, absolutely hilarious, WHY WERE YOU ON THE STAGE 😂😂😂
Anything more scouse than Carra saying “I love trackie bottoms” 🤣
Love carra
How can Neville genuinely say they’re gonna play 4 in midfield. Does this guy even watch United??? It was a make shift team to tackle the fact that they don’t have a fit out and out striker. As for the hole in the midfield, the only reason for that is that Martinez/Varane was the only CB pairing that allowed the line to push up and close the space between defense and midfield. Honestly shocking analysis from mr I’ve played the game
Neville predicted Utd to finish above Liverpool so technically there is no chance for Utd.. Bye bye Eth😂😂😂😂
Ffs why is gary always mention playing with 4 narrow center midfield, eth and us fans know utd are always gonna play either 433 or 4231. Gary you look like you're forcing it so that you can spread it to the media and try to make eth change his style!
Wrighty is right about grief , it never leaves you , it might not pop up for months , but then something can happen that reminds you of something and the pain is just as bad as it was when you lost the person. I lost my mom and dad within a year of each other 5 years ago , and I can talk about them and remember them with people , but I can be at home watching TV and something unexpected will remind me of them and I'm grieving again,  and it becomes a rabbit hole of grief for a while , your mind seems to drag you into thinking more things , the worst is the never seeing them again thought , I'm 51 and that thought of never seeing mom and dad again is frightening,  for a few seconds you feel like a child and scared , it's a very strange  feeling. Until it happens you never understand what grief is , its one of the hardest emotions about living I think , break ups or losing a job or whatever is tough , but losing a loved one is permanent,  there is no fixing the problem in a year or whatever. I felt for wrighty as he was talking , sometimes it helps to talk about it with people.
Giant mini roll as a birthday cake was a nice touch
I never used to like Wrighty until I seen him on this podcast and you get to see what a genuine good man he is. We all need a friend like Wrighty
There's a huge possibility that Carragers smile will fade away for a few years soon. Lets make sure it gets pointed out daily.
Roy Keane being this funny still surprises me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keane raging about Gary forgetting his birthday... So goes on the attack... Bitter
Keep your chin up Ian !!
Ghandi need to relax a little bit with the sugar. We all can see it Teddy.
Even better when carra is on
neville and keane are blinded by bias
Australian Rules coach Malcolm Blight made his players sit in a circle in the dressing room and smoke/pass around an Indian peace pipe as a bonding exercise. True story.
They've become more and more predictable and biaaed that this show isnt fun to watch anymore.
Was getting worried at the start that Roy was on holiday. Phew. No   Roy No Show
"Oh good, I get to listen to Carra"...said nobody ever
arsenal will finish 4th or 5th I really cant see them having another season fighting for top
Didn’t miss Carragher…🙄
Still nobody has spotted the YouTube award
‘Cheers Ghandi…..’ straight into the intro … Spat my drink at that bit….😂
A few candles on a cake are a fire hazard? No one even batted an eyelid when he said it. Absolutely pathetic. This kind of thing is why I live out East.
Olympics according to Roy Keane- one race every 4 years!
Poor Gary, got absolutely ripped to shreds 😂😂😂 love the dynamic of these lot
The talking over each other is so annoying
Most enjoyable especially with everyone at the table..to see and hear the pure joy and sad remembrances..just remarkable..the friendship between Wrighty and Roy has such depth..the beginning of a new season
Serial winners and carra
Newcastle to lose at home to Southampton! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hope you guys are leaving a spare seat and a croissant out for Rooney.  He'll be along shortly...
All Roy wants to do is do it bigo bigo
Roy, tone it down. If he wanted to go on the stage and he was asked , he did it.  Stop having a fcking go every time.
Starmer not invited  ?. What's Gary's opinion now. ?.
Villa are not gonna be near top 4 this year.
So glad to see carra back 🙌
It's not your job , just do your job Gary , c,Mon Gary just do your job.
The agenda that Ten Hag will be sacked by Christmas is disgusting, pundits & newspapers are so hungry about negativity regarding Manchester United.   Ineos made the choice to stick with Ten Hag, they will keep their head clear and keep him for two seasons minimum, unless over the first full season he drastically missmanages, which is not going to happen.
Carra! Missed you mate, please stick around!   Love and Best Regards,  A non liverpool supporter
Love the show but this episode was just screaming and talking over each other.
Tbh the thought of Gary DJing at a concert reminds me of David Brent walking onto the stage in that club dressed like Austin Powers
Cheers Gandhi 😂
There's a lot of Ian talking over everyone in this ep
Roy Keane, man his humor is on a different level! Adidas, Gillette , GQ! 😂😂😂
"Not doing negativity" what a fake, 2025 bullshit ideology.
Missed these lot over the last few weeks you don't know what you got till its gone .
Liverpool attack every competition? Come on Carra.. Liverpool drop out of everything including the league, they've been doing that for 2 decades at least at this point. They always drop competitions if they have a chance to win 1 thing.
It's shocking that Roy & Gary (and Carra by proxy) are so close to United but still don't fundamentally understand why Man Utd were so open last year. It's because the back four was a mess due to injuries and the players filling in were not able to play a high line. De Ligt, Martizen and Yoro are able to do that so if they stay fit (Yoro is already out), they will player a higher line and close the gap with the midfield.
Love hearing them talk about their careers and lives and everything like that but their actual current football knowledge is honking 😂
G Nev got United set up in a 4-5-3 sytem. Could work.
Gandhi it is
This was chaos. Everyone just talking over each other. Hard to watch
Ian and Roy need a watch sponsor...
FFS wrighty you want some tea to go with your sugar!!! How you not type 2 bro
ben is a spas
Love and hugs Wrighty.
You look good for 53? Why what is 53 meant to look like?
Brilliant ep this 😂😂😂😂 Arsenal or Adidas creased me
Roy on fire this week
it's impressive how little listening Carragher does when it comes to talking about Man Utd... Gary is literally saying he doesn't know what ETH is going to do with the midfield and that he could be thinking of doing what he did against city... Jamie's just constantly shouting over him saying "yeh but that's city" as if that adds aything to the conversation....  He's always arguing against points that people aren't making
Spurs above Liverpool and Liverpool not in the top 6? Think Gary had too many happy pills at that festival when he was dj ing haha. What an absolutely horrific shout hahahaha. Even Spurs fans know that`s a pipe dream at best.
1:04:05 😂
The guys are so ruthless to poor Gary 😅
I can listening these legends all day long Roy Keane and Ian Wright 🐐 🍿
❤ Ian Wright ❤
I went Kendal calling and I can confirm Roy. I wanted to see Nev 😂
Roy is definitely mad Gary forgot his birthday.. 😅
Oh and City win the league, which one the Nationwide? 😅
👏 this show… honestly best football show out there
Is roy drunk or something. Theres jokes then going on n on  Hes not captain now, he needs to chill out
Cameraman really didnt wanna leat Ian hide how much sugar his putting in
1:19:18 great advice by Wrighty
This started off as a football podcast but has very quickly become “The Roast of Gary Neville”
Pep's secret motivation for his players is his personal doctors phone number... 💉
How are Man Utd one of the top clubs, they finished 8th?
Keane is on form today 😂😂😂
Keano turning in to Victor Meldrew 😂
Roy talking about Kevin and Perry movie . The best movie ever with some legendary tunes back in the day
Respect to Wrighty
Love Keane constantly calling wrighty ghandi 🤣
Liverpool will make you eat these words.  Harvey Elliott player of the season.
Straight out the gate… Roy and tearing Gary a new one 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love to Wrighty, had no idea about his brother passing away ❤️   They spent so much talking less about the new season but about DJ G Nev/birthday cake/Olympics and it was brilliant 👏🏽
The Man Utd conversation was such a waste of time. Are they not keeping up with what United are doing? They are clearly going to sign a midfielder, whether it's Ugarte, Berge or someone else they will sign someone.
1:09:07 biggest shock, City get relegated.
Carragher needs to just shut up, if anyone goes against Liverpool he has to say something
Good to see Carra back and instantly clashing with Nev. Brilliant!
Everything about the man gets on my nerves, ever since he let himself and the people of his wonderful city down with a disgustingly disgraceful act, I notice his false laugh and honestly can't stand watching him and the boys should be putting him back on the bench. The characters and classy guys that have played for Liverpool and the boys have carra. Strange
roy - arsenal will defintely win the league. After artetas pick pocket stunt 😂😂😂😂😂
Man united top 4 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do they always all talk at the same time ?
Carra spoils it for me, sorry. Just don’t like the fella.
They need to get the pickpocketers on Keane 😂😂
Gary’s missing the point Roy isn’t saying footballers shouldn’t be on stage jumping around with dj’s he’s saying gary shouldn’t 😂
19:56 Keane and Wrighty are legends man
MANURE WONT FINISH IN TOP AND TEN HAAG WILL BE SACKED B4 DECEMBER LUCKY TO STILL HAVE HIS JOB SHOULD HAVE BEEN SACKED EVEN THO HE WON THE FA CUP LOUIE VAN HAAL  WAS SACKED AFTER WINNING A TROPHY IPSWICH  SOUTHAMTON B MOUTH DOWN LCFC 16TH EVERTON 9TH DYCHE WILL BE SACKED OR LEAVE THIS SEASON   ANOTHER MANAGER LUCKY TO STILL HAVE A JOB WEST HAM 15TH AND THEY WILL BE THE SHOCK BY WINNING THE FA CUP AND LEAGUE CUP BUT WILL DO ME AS ITS THERE LAST SEASON AT GOODISON PARK AND MOSHIRI WILL FINALLY SELL THE CLUB AS NO EVERTON WANTS AT THE CLUB
Carra is a staple on the show💪🏼 missed him on the show
The pure hatred and disdain for Ten Hag in the media is disgusting. Carragher has been talking about him getting the sack every single show he's on. Muppet.
Sorry to hear about Ian's losses. Its not easy losing a brother. RIP lads.
Do we have to sit and listen to them eating for ten mins every week?
keane liverpool not top 4.  gary not top 6.  haha i love clowns talking utter sh!te and come xmas they realise they meant man utd.
Teddy Gandhi should be Ian's actor name 😂
27:49 finally... England's final lost got mentioned on the show
Some of this was hard to listen to, everyone constantly talking over each other
Big up to wrighty ❤ I’ve just lost my grandad, I know how you’re feeling right now.. really touched me when he was speaking
Carragher spot on for once, win something, Get nothing for 2nd.
Go on Gary! Don't let the begrudgers get you down - good on ya!
top 4  arsenal league winners  man city villa spurs
Uncle Wrighty. Top bloke.
Newcastle winning the league for sure fools on here man
This is the best football "podcast", but I wish someone would control it a bit when there are 5 people all talking at once.
Not often I agree with carra but I do about the united midfield
Wrighty is so likeable. Looks like a good lad to hang around
Pep not leaving😂
Carra calling Tchouameni Too-koo-ameni will never not amuse me. It's Chew-a-meni. Zubimendi is holding out on a move to Barca apparently. Arteta tried to sign him last summer and earlier this summer. I'm surprised that a clued in guy like Edwards did not know that.
Gary mount is useless, why do you push English players so hard, do you think giving people things they don't deserve when they're under performing will help them in the long run. Grealish and mount are practically dei hires.
Gary finding a way to delude himself that United will have a good season again. We are so back 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
Is that harry kanes twin sister ?
Roy loves getting angry about stuff.  If he didn't have STF he would be shouting at pigeons in the park!   Love you Roy ❤
48:10 I can't believe Gary Neville is talking about fitting 4 Midfield players at the same time in the squad. has he never heard of Midfield depth? well, its a testament to his coaching success... or lack of...
Roy’s extra annoyed at Gary it seems 😂😂😂😂
No1 was paying Southampton the money lpool paid got f all to do with klopp vvd would have left Southampton if any top6 club came in for him
#TheOverlap seen Mr Ian Wright on an back in the day May 1996 #Topofthepops last night❤😂
Oh no they have to play a few more games a season and have to train, really feel for them 🙄🙄 if playing football and training is so difficult for them there's plenty of building sites they can get a job on, Carragher always complaining, not like people work all day, then go gym and play football for fun for nothing,, millionaire footballers complaining about playing football and training is a joke
Lol the Gaslighting from Roy.. 😂😂
Crystal Palace surprise of the season
Wild how they never mention City's hearing in September. The decision on punishment is likely to follow around spring 2025. How is that not going to affect their season? Imagine the run in when they've just been told they're getting relegated and Pep declares he's off. It will overshadow their whole season.
'I went to Kendal Calling' eight minutes of punishment
What a show, genuinely the best podcast on the internet, every week it brightens my week and so may it continue! Cara back is unreal
Utd had a fridge with Maguire and now a freezer in de ligt lol
Arsenal and Adidas 😂
zubi zubi doo 🎵🎵🎵🎵 where are you ?  🎵🎵🎵🎵
I’m surprised they didn’t even mention Newcastle when they were discussing top 6 predictions  And I’m also surprised they all think Southampton will stay up.
4 minutes in and Roy is already sucking the soul out of everything
Surprise, City get relegated!
Still can’t believe carra and Gary are like friends now 😂
What kind of tea is being served?  Anyone know?
Sending all my love to Ian Wright... losing a close friend and brother all in the space of a month can't be easy...💔
Never stop defending us Wrighty! 😍
1:05:24 when I thought I couldn't love Wrighty anymore
I've only had 2 sugars hahaha. That was as heaped as two sugars can ever be
Red rum club are a sick band pass it on
Roy is the real G.... Spared no time running after Gary
Roy Keane miserable grumpy bloke.
so we're not going to get an FA cup final reaction show
Roy Keane is glorious man isn't he... kicking off about the stage carry on..... Roy comes across as someone who'd absolutely lose his mind at a child's birthday party and the cake had one of them candles that re-ignite once they've been blown out..... what's it lighting back up for!!!!!
Imagine thinking Spurs and Man Utd will finish ahead of Liverpool.😂 Honestly, poor Gary needs to find a new hobby.
Gary says United will finish above Liverpool every season and statistically hes right 50% of the time during Klopps spell in charge. People acting like Liverpool were this dominant force under Klopp, they weren't.
Anyone notice how Gary was shitting himself a little bit when a Roy walked in? 😂
Another episode that is completely unwatchable/unlistenable.  Im sure that providing food creates a nice casual ambiance for you lot to work in, but from a production stand point, it makes this show unbearable. All we can hear is chewing, lips smacking, unintelligible chat from mouths full of food etc. Its absolutely disgusting. The quality of the show would increase 50x just but getting rid of the need to scran constantly. Eat before you record and stick to drinks during recording. Notice how absolutely no other podcast or tv production eats whilst trying to record?? Theres a reason why.... makes this whole show amateur hour.
Roy and Ian saying saints will beat newcastle away and staying up has made my day lol
So glad Gary helped inflict 2 Tier Keir on the Nation
Wrighty is a massive wet wipe when it comes to arsenal. Probably because he’s on the payroll has to be super positive
15:15
The way carra speaks you’d think Liverpool won what city won in recent years😂😂😂😂
Can you imagine if Arteta was at Man United and won one trophy in 5 years, the media would bury him
GARY YOU SHOULD GET TOM DALEY ON FOLLOWING HIS RETIREMENT
wont be a shock if man city dont win the league as they will get at least a 10 point deduction if found guilty
Wrighty ❤
Neville is tactically clueless
Welcome back Jamie
I think Arteta is a bloody tit frankly.   The players were having dinner, not setting up an FSB in Afghanistan ffs!
It’s great to hear wise words from Teddy Gandi ❤ the sincerity with which he spoke was amazing. Top lad!
Man i get hungry every episode 😭
Thought good monson was Bob Mortimer's cat.
You don't necessarily need to beat City two times to win league, they just need to beat the teams below them
Mainoo was injured start of the season, Casimero injured, Mount injured. Two of those never regained fitness.
Gary was on smoke today 😂
The only way Arsenal can get going is winning their first 10 games just to mount early pressure on city
Wrighty, just love him. Best podcast out there.
Nice one Wrighty  ⚒️⚒️⚒️
Can you stop talking over each other?
what was the documentary Carra talks about at 15:52???
Roy was on one today
Can’t remember the last time I put sugar in tea or coffee 😂😂
Chelsea to beat City 2-0 on the opening weekend. Bookmark this. Jackson and Nkuku will score.
Arsenal or adidas 😂😂
Roys getting thin on top..cant see him going for a hair transplant thou 😂😂
Whos been on their holidays? 😂 thinking us mere mortals can even afford a holiday these days.
Zirkzee is going to play not Holund, hopefully Erik will make sure Zirkzee is fit for the beginning of the season, and he himself needs to get his fitness up, 10x better version of Martial, Elegant, for the eyes he will look slow, or nonchalant but he has so much quality and better link up play than Holund.
This is just the best football podcast around
Sorry for your loss Wrighty! Wishing you find peace again in your life because you deserve it. The Gunner family is here for you 🔴⚪️
Them Beys are Magic 😂
Welcome back Carra …definitely missed you
Oh god, carragher is back.......🙄
Keane is so cranky in the video today :D
Roy Keane is so jealous of Gary it sticks out a mile!
Kid spitters back...
is the sound abit  laggy
My best friend in school had a sense of humour like Wrighty. It didn’t follow him to adulthood though. Life beat it out of him.
Love this bollocks
Is Gary on a wind up this year?? 😂😂😂
City to finish outside top 4 with points deduction 😊
Ah Mr Ian Wright we are with you man x
A good concept, but impossible to watch when everybody talks at the same time
Try and talk over each other more next vid
Can you guys make a super sox league and the winner gets to come for a day or something?
“Give that bit to the DJ 🤣” 11:12
Keane = eejit
Keane and wrighty make this show hahaha
28:47 love Wrighty 28:57
Keane is an angry man…. Let Gary enjoy his DJing 😂
Mason Mount weakens united it is criminal what an easy ride he gets for being a shocking signing
The behind the scenes part has become so tedious
How’s your buddy Keir getting on Gary?
wrighty is just a classy bloke man lovely person to the core
Red Rum Club. Get on them 🎶
Lets start a petition right now!! Roy and Wrighty  both need to be doing punditry and these type of shows for at least the next 2 decades 😑
Ian’s over the top defensive of arsenal is too much.
I've just realized that Gary sounds like Ricky Gervais's character Derek. Listen in 13:30 when he asks Roy where will he be in 10 years?.
Best content on Youtube.
'Fatboy slim over there' 🤣🤣🤣
Football is so boring
I love this show 😂
Please don’t do the show while you’re eating…how disrespectful. Have some tea/coffee but please stop stuffing your faces while you’re presenting the show…
“Gandhi” HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA 😂😂😂
Carra is an unrepentant ABU , blinded by envy 🙄
Biggest shocker will be Roy Keane will be back Premier League Manager this season. 😉
Roy loves his Wrighty the bromance is so clear to see ❤️❤️
❤❤ Much love Wrighty  ❤❤
Roy walks in all guns blazing!
Hate it when they won’t do relegation predictions. Grow up and just name the 3 you lemons
kompany is a born winner carnt wait fr him to manage city
3:14  The Gary Neville seal of approval 🤝
Surprise of the season….I think Liverpool will win the Premier League.
47:50 and would you have it, shaw is injured 🤣
Haven't watched any football pods since the Euro final but as the season starts this weekend, let's get this started.....RIGHT.
Call ian TG from now on
This lot are always so negative about Newcastle.
Glad Roy called out Wrighty for always getting defensive when talking about Arsenal or anything related to Arsenal.
Roy Kean for president!
You,guys are very negative about Pep & City. Cozy you are praying for him to leave. 😅
Carragher really wasn't a miss off the podcast during the Euros.
Stay strong Wrighty
Poor episode guys, should really talk about all the clubs and not just the ones yous played for !!
Large parts of that was an assault on the ears
Off the ball united have been much better specially vs City.
Poor Wrighty, that was so sad
Feel  for Wrighty. ❤
Why’s carra lying about Zubi 🤣 he didn’t want to join mate and accepted a contract on less money than youse offered him to stay at solciadad
Disgraceful stuff by GNev
Ghandi is a real trouble maker....Gary didn't remember your birthday Roy 😂😂😂😂
Keano appears to soften around Ghandi.....He doesn't like to appear happy. 😊
I'm glad Ian Wright said that about synchronised swimming, I've always thought the same.
Lost my brother a few months ago, it aint easy
Katie Price would love that cake
Manutd  finds  top premierleague table
G Neville astonishes me. His love for English utd players just shows his biased towards them. Mount never starts for this team. Dialo and Garna are starters of the rest give over
Looks like they all got out of the wrong side of the bed
I love this podcast, you can feel the honest discussions and banters here unlike other imposed laughing clips.
Happy birthday Royston. ✌🏾
No one:...  Gary: D'YA KNOW SOMETHING
CHELSEA FINISHING 2ND
Being a deejay has to be in the top ten of euphoric experiences being an individual..the buzz is ubdiscribable when the right tune hits the crowd
Wright & Keane is deffo Deadpool & Wolverine relationship 😂
Teddy Ghandi Wright - hiding his sugar scoops 😂😂😂😂😂😂. Gotta love Teddy 🧸❤️
Cara "did anyone miss your birthday Roy" 😂😂😂
The football season chat is the worst part of Stick to Football. Change my mind!
Why can they not see that Mctominay is a hindrance...utd shoulda bitten the hand off Fulham...he's pants...shoulda done a swap with Paulinha but Bayern got him
Happy birthday Roy 🏆👊🏾
"You get defensive anything about Arsenal...................or Adidas!!" 🤣
FEEL YOUR IAN X
Had to comment on Ian wright sorry for your loss mate related to so much of what you said god bless
Way too much talking over the top of each other.  Makes it hard to follow the conversation
Listening to this show you’d think man united, Man City, Liverpool and arsenal are the only teams in England. Getting so boring now it’s beyond pathetic.
I love it when Cara and Gary start bickering over tactics and formations. Cara knows his stuff!
Such an Elite cast 💯
More football talk, the BS talk at the start is getting boring.
When is my favourite player of all time gigssy coming on???
Keane giving out about being on stage is brilliant 😂
Roy Keane would start an argument in an empty house.
Love this show ❤😂🎉
The craziest thing about the Turkish shooter, the 2nd place was for team event. His average score in that event would have been enough to win the individuals event. He put his nation on his back to come 2nd in reality
Ironic that it's called "Stick to Football" and majority of the time they are jut chatting nonsense.
How can the Roy Keane Birthday Cake segment be nearly an hour long hahah😅
Roy Keane hates fun 💯
12:40 BS if Garys got a calendar , just don't think he gives a monkeys TBH. Personally I'd have predicted he wouldn't remember Roys birthday. Then at 13:25 asks a weird question to change the subject , he's a bit of a nob
Keep underrating United. I can’t wait
Cheers ghandi😂😂😂😂
Best football show
Sending you love from Canada, Wrighty! ❤ This group is a great balance. Brilliant.
Cheers Gandhi.... Roy is full of bants
Yes Wrighty! More I hear of him the more I love him. The Artistic swimming is a sport I didn't know I needed thanks to the Olympics.
Don't get me wrong I love the overlap but same teams getting spoke about every week when it's a 20 team league. I know we have x manc players but face it their shite now and you're living in the past so I don't want to hear about them every week.😂
"What was the jumping like.. Were you jumping with the same Gary Neville face?" Hahaha
Wrighty- “you moving on or what!?” 😂
“I just don’t know how they do synchronised swimming, how they’re breathing and doing all that movement.”  Roy: “Practice?”  😂
Gary fuming about 'Scholesy's point' 😂
My Father knew Nicky and he said he was a good man,R.I.P to Nicky Wright and Kevin Campbell,condolences to Ian Wright and the Family
19:00 Remember when Maddison picked Jorginho pocket. 😂😂😂
God I have missed these shows make my week
Glad carra is back 🤘🏻
I've lost count this episode of the number of Roy's one liners that has crushed everyone!! Great start to the new season everyone👍👍
Getting a bit of a belly there Gary😮
Always the highlight of my day! Been watching old episodes and whenever a new one comes on I’m there. Thank you for making life easier
Wish Roy spoke about United and Gary about losing 2-0 to the Vale!! UTV⚫⚪
28:06 Wrighty is a absolute, god damn diamond of a human, Protect this global treasure at all costs
Carra brings nothing, and just laughs the loudest at his own jokes, did not miss him one bit when it was just the others.
Spurs top four 🤣They struggled last season playing one game a week. You can see why Neville was a failure as a manager. Clueless.
Chelsea being underestimated by all the pundits. Love it
The government will take free bus passes next.
Some much needed light relief, thanks everyone ❤
Sending love wrighty!!! ❤
Man United don't have to play the same system in every game, they can switch it up now they have versatile player's "if" they keep the player's fit I wouldn't be surprised if they finish 2nd or 3rd.
"we can get a mannequin in and itll be the same"- keane 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tough summer for me as well, lost me moms, my biggest inspiration. Hang in there Wrighty💪🏾❤
The only one to give the crew a hug after not seeing them for 3 weeks….Wrighty 🤝
Football changed since most pundits played.
13:23 Love how everyone was ready to move on from Roy's birthday and then Gary chimes in with the classic existential dread of a question that no one wants to think about 🤣🤣😂😂
Alright Ghandi 😂
The whole gang is back together and I love it 🤣🤣 pure vibes 🔥🔥
Great to have Carra back! Can't stop laughing about Ghandi 😂
was working on the bar at kendall calling, was genuinely quite upset that my break didn't coincide with seeing Gary DJ!
Did wrighti call Roy Ryan 🙈😂
You known when Roy calls Wrighty, Ian. He’s being serious 🤣🤣
Bless u uncle Wright.. ❤
Liverpool being disrespected as usual lol. They'll finish 3rd at a minimum. Their players are still quality and they have young talent
37:45 carra defo talking about cisse
Roy is only jealous of Gary at Kendall calling..Live your best life . Gary do what you want .
Are we just pretending the European Final didn’t happen haha
Calm down Roy. Gary had fun!! 😂
You guys really need to stop having 2 different conversations at the same time and talking over each other it makes it so hard to listen to. Please someone take control and stop everyone talking at the same time.
Its Roy calling Wrighty , Gandhi🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think what Gary is saying is, if united play a 4-2-2-2, so the lineup would be  Dalot de ligt martinez mazraoui Casemiro Mainoo Mount Fernandes Amad Garnacho   That's I think that is what he was meaning
Cheers Gandhi #Roy 😂
How am I supposed to get things done when they pop these episodes out?
05:54 20:18 28:20 36:35
How on earth can you say Man U over Liverpool for top four? They’d be lucky to get in the top half this season.
Switched off at 1 hour 15 talking over each other way to much.
Omfg Roy never just called wrighty ghandi, did he! ahhhahahaha 🤣😂
Nice of Jamie to show up after court
Gary biased united wont be in top 4
I think Roy uses anger to mask his emotions.  This one was pretty emotional
So much respect and love for wrighty, he’s dealt with his losses like an absolute champ
Condolences to Wrighty x
You can measure a human being by how they treat those working in the background and Wrighty is a gem of a person. Always genuine with everyone in the room and super supportive. Everyone needs a Wrighty in their life!
LFC will finish ahead of United deluded utd panelist.
Nev’s ball knowledge is getting progressively worse
Why is Barry Bannan moonlighting here.......
Roy is on 1 today 😂
Get rid of Carragher, much better without him, he clearly just hates Ten Hag
Feel for Wrighty, hope he’s doing well
Chelsea will waltz into top 4 no problem. Keeping all receipts. Regardless of what these 50 year olds pundits stuck in the past. Ten head out by november n Southgate in 😂😂 top 4 my bollocks. United finishing 7th at best.  Neto isnt injury prone. Breaking your knee cap then tearing ankle ligaments is unlucky. He doesnt pull his hamstring every 6 weeks like fatboy shaw. The delusion of these puppets
It like being in glass room lol
Smash this like button if we want to see Roy Keane DJ set next year at Glastonbury
Comparing Gary to Kevin & Perry is too much man 🤣
Wrighty ❤
Man U finish 8th and apparently will be 3rd this year… they’ve signed an 18yr old defender unproven in any top league and injured, another that can’t get in past Eric Dier, and a striker that couldn’t start for the Dutch. But yeah…
everyone got on Gary's back about united midfield and the way they'll set up compared to last season, but he was right. Think he showed in that moment he has the best tactical mind for a teams shape at least of anybody at that table.
1:22:20 Roy's a comedian!
Wrighty so sorry to hear about your brother,Wrighty you have to know just how much you are loved,LEGEND COYG ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They were cutting the cake for 50 minutes? Such bad time markers
Excellent 😊
This is the best one yet, creasing 😂😂
This shouldn't be called Premier League Preview. It should be Big 6 preview - they don't talk about anyone else!
Gary's glasses are class😂😂
Yeah Ŕoy the 10th same as my mates
I love Roy Keane so much
Gandhi 😂 If he did it properly he might have come first 😂 Keano was on form today..
Thanks for more great content
I originally liked this podcast because it was a lot more relaxed, calm discussion, but the last few episodes have had a lot of shouting and arguments which is a disappointing direction for this podcast to go.
20:23 😂😂😂😂😂 wowwwowewww
Love to you Wrighty ❤️
So sorry about your loses wrighty
Also lol shaw is injured
Why did they have to bring carrager  back? Been so good without him. Can't stand the bloke 😒
CARRA’S BACK!
I've always loved Keano, but I think might love Ian Wright just as much. A pure gentleman and just seems like an all round top man with a heart of gold
Roy being a year older is overrated. That’s his job!
Laughing my head off at 9am - quality!!
Cheers Ghandi 😂😂😂...Brilliant.
Ian talking about his  brother 😢
5 mins in and Roy is irate already 🤣
The Burnley doc, i Said the same as Keane, if he talked like Kompany did, everyone would say typical Keane being abusive
10:06 🤣🤣
I think these are the only people that have predicted Man United to finish top 4 😂
Are these people incapable of having a conversation without stuffing their faces? The food situation's ridiculous.
Jamie asks Gary a question then just sits there smirking 😂
Cheers Gandy lol
Pure anger even when he's cutting the cake. 😂
Gary Neville is such a plum
Oh my God chill the fk out Roy !  Of course Gary should get up on the stage and have a buzz . Grumpy or what 😂😂.
I had a rock stage at kendal calling for last few years. This year it was axed and we were replaced with Gary effin neville. Definitely a low point in my life
Happy birthday Roy mate 👍
Man U might not make Top 6 again 😅😅😅
Lazy Arsenal analysis yet again. If Arsenal went and beat Fulham, West Ham, Newcastle or Villa they would have won the league. Drawing at City wasn't the issue. If Arsenal won one of those games and won the league, the narrative wouldn't be "City went to the Emirates and Anfield and couldn't get the win"
Sorry for your loss, Ian. ❤
Big love to wrighty been a tough time bless him
Can some one tell Carragher to stop whispering. It's not a secret
Surprise of the season: CRYSTAL PALACE GETS INTO EUROPE🦅🦅
This was absolute chaos…needs sorting out 😂
That producer bloke at start of every episode is he Barry Bannans twin brother 🤣
Villa will beat their points tally from last season so it’ll all depend what others do around them .  In my opinion, football has changed and coaches mean more now than ever
Wrighty talking about how difficult synchronised swimming looks and saying he doesn’t know how they do it and Roy just goes “practice” 😂😂😂
Carra loves hammering on Utd 🤣🤣
Gary you have zero charisma so give up the small talk
Constant talking over.  Just noise.
TeddyGandi😂😂
Gary sounds hungover. Must have had half a shandy last night
“Cheers Gandhi” 😂😂😂
hahaha props to the camera man getting in on the sugar shot 😂
Southampton to beat Newcastle? 😂
Carragher is back🥴
“Where do you see yourself in 10 years, Roy”?  “Do you think you’ll still be here”?  “No… I mean doing the podcasts, not dead” 😂😂😂
One more episode without Carra and I will block this whole channel from my feed.
Ben should get danger money.
great off-season for Gary being a DJ Gary
Comedy Gold.
Ah Fuk Wrighty. Yeh. Lost a Sister recently. It won't pass. Like the first Love. Just gotta shoulder it with everything else. Keep on keeping on everyone.
This show could literally just be a breakfast show with the last 20mins about football 😊
2:57 that cameraman is a problem😂😂😂😂
Carra has been away for a while but just slotted right back in. Good stuff!
ROY, swear-muttering under his voice whilst cutting that cake is the funniest thing I've seen all year. *Pissing my sides.* Proper miserable. 😂
Absolutely no chance United get in the top 4
DJ Gary Neville sounds like something out of Phoenix Knights.
I'm sorry but after the draw vs city we went unbeaten and won every game except fumble vs villa ! 16 wins one draw and one loss vs good villa team ! were talking trossard going 1 foot either side of Martinez !
Gary the DJ leave off ffs 😂
Suckers Surprise of the season will be chelsea second
I’m excited for this season.
Love to you Wrighty, look after yourself man. ❤️❤️❤️
The behind the scenes section is always the best part of the episode
Here we go 👍
How can anyone back a united team that finished 8th to finish above spurs and villa
Man U will not be in the top 4, the manager will be sacked by Christmas
Nothing controversial is ever said by these fakers.
When carragher gets heated with Neville it sounds like someone has hit the fast forward button 😂
Start a series where they all have to try different sports. Synchronised swimming would be hilarious. Bmxing against each other, Gary in his little knee pads and helmet.
It gets a little boring and tedious going after Gary Neville all the time. He may or may not deserve  the criticism,  but really enough is enough....
jesus keano needs to chill does matter went on stage
The Super Six section was so f$*!ing annoying. Everyone overexcited and talking at once. You could see the producer guy looked annoyed too. Needed Carra to tell everyone  to "calm down, calm down."
Roy “go watch like a normal person” 😂
Best football show out there. Please stay out of politics and just fuel football love. Don't do a Gary lineker
Not wanting to name relegated teams lol
Wrighty appreciation button! Stay strong mate you’re loved out here ❤
Can tell Carra is back, I’m reaching for the subtitles. 😂
Roy bursting Gary's bubble
5 people screaming over each other for the first 8 mins 😅
Love this, the first 5 minutes reminds me of my mates just chatting "£$%$ love it
After watching the football iconic video on Ian wright, my respect for the man reached new heights, dude is an inspiration
27:29 It's Carolina Marín
There is good scientific data that when 5 people are in a conversation it breaks down into two separate groups and conversations (observe it yourself the next time you're at a social event).  This is why this episode was largely people talking over each other, making it quite hard to listen to.
Carragher brings this podcast down so much. I struggle to watch it when he is on it.
This is why im paying for internet.
If they can get Cantona on the pod, might make it the best pod on the platform
Loved watching Gary enjoy Kendal calling. Lighten up Roy 😂
Sorry for your troubles Wrighty..Top Man 👍🏻
Until the Olympics start sharing, the huge sponsorship deals with their athletes i won't bother with it. So corrupt.
You don't have to beat your main rivals away to win the league, check the stats!
Why does Jamie get so passionate about Utd, they talked about City and Arsenal he never said a word, then I was guns a blazing ready to criticise Utd. 😅
If arsenal lose any games this season there'll be plenty of pockets picked memes going around
Roy calling Wrighty - Gandhi🤣🤣🤣; i guess that name that Roy gave him in the episode a few weeks ago has now stuck🤣
This show is great, they just talk over each other too much. Sometimes 3 conversations going on at once.
If i went to a festival and Gary Neville was DJ'ing I dont know what I would do
Honestly most of this show is just fluff now
Shaw already injured. Out until mid September
Gandhi!
I'm so excited for the new season😍
I wonder what would of happened if one of the players caught one of the pickpockets nicking their phone....
Really difficult to follow this these days, they're all talking over each other.  It's a mess
Keano was mad at Gary you for forgetting his birthday. 😅 Gandhi😅😅😅
10:30 giant mini roll 😂
Provide more timestamps…
Roy being accused of going Burnley v Luton😂
ROY is weird at times.
Carragher the Scouser seems a bit touched about United 😂😂😂😂😂
Carra gets so aggro when talking about United. Martinez is too small, Casemiro's legs have gone, will it be a surprise ETH lasts until Christmas. I'm hoping Casemiro has a good season because Carra saying he should stop playing at the highest level is embarrassing.
Wrighty 😢😢❤❤ big hugs xxxx
Ian Wright - National Treasure
Thoughts and prayers for Gary Neville, he's having a hard time getting paid to talk gash with his mates for a living...
Carragher once again showing again how uncultured the scouse man is
“Roy… you even cut cake angry” 😂😂😂
Ian is such a lovely guy man. He's honest as a friend. Tells you straight up how he feels
Roy has a real issue with FOMO! 😜
Condolences Wrighty,  much love to ya ❤
Really don't care for the production staff being on camera, they're getting a bit too big for their boots considering they're nobodies.
Roy seems like such a great person to keep you grounded, His take on Gary being on stage is hilarious🤣🤣🤣
This episode is making me late for work.. Gary still fears  keano
20:18
WHWRE WAS RHE EURO FINAL VIDEOOOOO
Best intro ever 😂😂😂
“Jumping with the same Gary Neville face”?  “I can’t imagine him….dancing or having fun” 😂😂😂
Since they're being wetties can we do relegated teams?  Forest Bournemouth Ipswich
"Jumping with the Gary Neville face"
Welcome back Cara
Keano on fine form
GN says United will finish 4th every year , nowhere near it again this season , probs 6th/7th
Should definitely try and get David Ornstein on this show at some point!!
I love the opening to the show, for me it is the best part, Roy is amazing...lol, laugh so much, so funny. 'Don't go on the stage"!!!!
Ian “ morning everyone “.... Roy..... “ why where you on stage with a dj Gary ??” 😂😂😂😂
29:23 Ian man xx
Carra checkin' oot Gal's guns
Sending love Wrighty.❤️
2:25 Gary's terrified Roy's going to start him about his birthday 😂😂
Best programme on the planet 👌 👏
Roy's on fire as usual😂😂😂😂😂
R.I.P Kevin Campbell
You know you could just record this once and then play it every year to save you money. Man U, Liverpool, Bla Bla Bla
These guys sucks at predicting LOL
Only took 10 minutes of irateness for Roy to admit he was jealous of uptight Nev
Everyone laughing at Tottenham. Same old.
The seriousness of Gary at 12:50 lol
These shows make my day better
Gandhi!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Happy birthday Roy...I'm a fellow corkonian and we are very proud of u and everything u do for Ireland.  Thanks roy
How many people sucking up to Keane and his fake laugh today?
18:50 Roy’s sarcasm 😂
got a bit choked listening to Wrighty's bit about his brother and Campbell, lost a few people very close to myself in quick succession and it is a stange time, keep strong brother!
Why would it be "ridiculous" for City to get relegated if they are found guilty?  They should be removed from the football league all together and have their asterisk trophies taken away.
I do miss Roy rants between episodes.
Let’s hope these guys don’t just call de ligt a reject from Bayern and actually do their research unlike other pundits in England
Gary starting the show like “cba” 😂😂
Gary is always cool when someone takes the mickey at him. I like that about him. Relaxed character.
Happy Birthday Mr Keane. 🎉
This series is putting me off Roy Keane. He’s a miserable pr1ck sometimes. Let Gary blow off some steam ffs
Nice to see Carra back. Not quite the same vibe without him.
One person at a time.
You can see if Arsenal lose games,all the journos racing to say the other team picked their pockets😂
Keane's getting annoying now. He's so intolerant
Christ...all talking at once....shut up.
Like if you skipped straight to league predictions
Something tells me Roy Keane and Karl pilkington together would be absolute gold
Luv listening to these chaps talk
Strongs to Wrighty❤
I’ve never clicked a video so fast.
This programme is simply fantastic. Long may it continue.
Man Utd have finished above Lpool more times than they have
@05:25 "It's not him.... GHANDI!" 🤣🤣🤣
5 minutes in and Wrighty pouring fuel to the fire already 🤣
"Gary was busy Deejaying wasn't he" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I'm so happy Roy is a United Legend, what a funny guy
Good morning all, I hope you enjoy the “fix” as much as I will.
9:25 please 😫
Thank god there is a new ep this is better than The House of Dragon ❤❤❤
Roy's had a fight with his missus. He's particularly testy on this one. 😂 🤦🏻‍♂️ Arteta did the pick pocketing thing because his players are always getting robbed. 😂😂
❤️ goes out to Mr Wrighty sorry for your loss
Hang in there Wrighty🙏❤️
Liverpool hate everywhere lol,  We will be there
Teddy ghandi....classic
So glad Carra is back
Teddy Ghandi🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wrighty ❤😢
“Ghandi”😂😂😂😂. Roy is probably going to be a school headmaster in his next life, one of the strict ones that use a wooden paddle when you’re naughty 😂😂😂
Poor old Gary, gets his 10 minutes of stick every show before kick off lol
Roy calling Ian Wright Gandhi. We are SO back 😂
Best intro. 😂
This show is everything ❤
Get Roy doing a dj set at kendal calling Nev 😂
Way too much talking over each other early on in the Super Six. No wonder old mate was confused. Really hard to follow guys.
Kompany lost control. Nothing wrong with digging someone out but he was just effing and Jeffing. I’d lose respect for that leadership. Tell people straight but don’t treat people like their dickheads.
Thinking of you wright wright wright ❤
Will we ever get their views on Euros 2024 final on this podcast
Yes! They is backkkkk
5:29 “ITS NOT HIM NOW, IT’S NOT HIM… GHANDI”🤣🤣🤣 Roy Keane never fails to make me laugh
Roy and Garry go large!! ‘All I wanna do is pundit’
as i recall liverpool wasnt in the top 4 in 22/23 season.
Newcastle top 4?
11:53 Carra had to do that 😂😂😂
Should do a podcast called Angry Dad, starring Roy Keane lol😂🤣😂
Carragher loses all objectivity when it comes to United. tHeY haD THe saMe pLaYerS LASt SEAsON.
Love Roy 😂
Rou Keane to run a marathon. Stamp it.
I’m here for the company. I Imagine these are my mates
That's it Roy you fuckin tell him 😂😂
Happy birthday Roy! A fellow Leo here, my bday is tomorrow🎉
The premier league season wouldn't feel the same without stick to football
20 mins in… this could be the best episode yet…
Did u redden the lighting so that Roy doesn’t look too angry? 😅 everyone’s reddd
GANDHI !!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best podcast ❤
I nearly watched this the other day when they dropped it by accident… 😂
Lara Croft is today's special guest 😂😂😂😂😂
Ferguson could never pick  A team like this,😊
The whole gang is back!
Gary getting battered on this episode 😅😂
Jumpin with the same Gary Neville face 😂
Summer dump 😂
Maybe Neville can give Tim Burgess a game up front for Salford in return
I wish my old man was alive to hear all these stories.   He Loved Roy Keane
When’s wrighty bringing in his pies for everyone to try?
Carra is a 🔔🔚. He wasn't missed
Always felt that Roys a Leo.. Natural born leader imo. All jokes aside, Would love to hear someone talk to Roy about star signs 😂😂😂
I missed the guys, thankgod no more rerun shows from the euro's from a balcony from zee Deutschland
Roy secretly mad at Gary for forgetting his birthday 🤣
Bee U Gal
Neville without carra is weird they bounce off each other funny
Took Roy about 30 secs to get wound up 🤣
It's back!
"I just pressed play a few times"  Thats exactly what these DJ's do anyway!!
Wrighty gets so emotional when arsenal get mentioned😂
How have they not addressed the euros still is baffling.
Rooney will be back well before the overlap Halloween party. Dust off the shrek costume we're on a mad ting.
How painful must it be for those 2 ex Bantchester United players having to say City are going to win the League again 😭😭😭😭 love it 👌👌👌
Anyone play fpl? ld00nk join league
Ah can’t lie… kinda missed CARRA
Roy’s filthy about Gary DJing 😂
5 minutes in and Roy is lightning up Gary like firecracker! 🤣 If that isn't brotherly love, I don't know what is! 😄
Been a while since we’ve seen Cara
Coffee, joint, stick to football👌🏽
Roy and the boys to get us over hump day!
Great way to start the morning
Wednesday morning SORTED
Does ian want some coffee with that sugar?
So glad Carra's back
Remember, Roy does NOT like parties…or smiling! So I bet he hates his birthday! 😂
Keano has lost some forest
Almost first 😂 Só excited for the new PL season and more of the best show/channel on YouTube the Wrighty And Keano show 😊 just kidding Gary .

Happy birthday to the Captain!

Never thought I’d say it but I miss Cara on these shows
Love the Overlap! Excited for another season, they always keep it fresh and change small things in the format to keep it interesting!!   Which is better, Overlap or Rest is Football? 🤔
