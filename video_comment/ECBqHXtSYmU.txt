What the hell is happening in our Country.Our schools are not even safe.Put security guards and surveillance cameras in all our School
But u are not good😢
Helen zille she's angry always she's on denial.
I think mporo ne a tshwaregile, shame 🤞
Let him go and preach in jail son of darkness fake miracles, every dog has its day ke o etsa south Africans ditlaela. Letsogo la modimo le letelele😂
Mboro is a vulgar Swahili and Shona word but has a different meaning in South Africa....so how's would he conduct and publicise a Crusade in Zimbabwe and East Africa? Change to M'poro instead!
He is lusifa agent . false pastor .the bible says you shall know them according to there doing  Christians open your eyes 1: Timothy 6:10, Mathew 24:4-14,,2peter2-22,yuda 1:4,1John,4-5, Jeremiah 23:9
Lekolwane will always be lekolwane he must be arrested an banned from opening church
Our society is sick. This whole thing is wrong. Gayton, involving yourself in public matters will be the end of your political career. Remember your history
Samurai Jack Mboro 😂
Mckenzie is a very zenophoebic man since the beginning of his political reign why is such a man leader because he rules by racism and encourages hatred of nations
I WONDER WHAT IS ZONDO ,THEIR CHURCH MEMBERS AND TIRANO MOKOENA ARE SAYING COZ THIS IS PROOF THAT THEIR SNAKE AND EVIL FORCES WITHIN THE 3 IS EXPOSING HOW EVIL THEY ARE...AFTER WHAT ZOMBIE SHORTY MBORO MACHETE HAS DONE....
Shamefull
Mboro means a man’s manhood in my language
Don't you dare
This is not a pastor full of Demons

Pastor Maphanga😂😂😂😂
Mboro already has claws... Why the panga?
Jealous
Poor children. Thays so sad that their parents are in this thing
there are ways God will expose  fraudlent pastors
1:38  make up for me
Mboro must be stopped from operating as a minister as he is self  destructive... unsafe & unsaved  character leya
Shalom
Which channel on tv is this news channel.
Mboro means pen!s in shona
Apology not accepted!!
Lock this man up for good!
IF SUCH PEOPLE ARE OUR PASTORS THEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE
"Hatred" media propaganda
This is the end times, keep the faith,trust in the Lord Jesus Christ,only,read your Bible and pray always, Amen 🙏❤️🙏
Wanted to tell everyone that JESUS loves you all and  that JESUS CHRIST is KING.🙌🙌 ❤️  Those who wanna accept JESUS as LORD and SAVIOUR here is the PRAYER of SALVATION. According to [Romans 10 v 9 ]  "O Lord God, l believe with all my heart in JESUS CHRIST, Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I believe He's alive today. I confess with my Mouth that JESUS CHRIST is the LORD of my life from this day. Through Him and in His Name, l have eternal life; lam born again. Thank you LORD for saving my soul! Iam now a child of GOD."HALLELUJAH"  HOLY SPIRIT, come into heart,  "AMEN."  CONGRATULATIONS BELOVED 😘  (John 14 v 6) JESUS answered, “I am the WAY and the TRUTH and the LIFE. No one comes to the Father except through me. "HALLELUJAH"
This is not about Christianity, it is about why the maternal grandmother is the guardian. Why? There is a big tsunami coming over this country by way of fathers wanting their rights. Mens mental health is never looked at. Men are always expected to act in a certain way. If it was a mother wanting her children, how would the community react?
To my understanding, her father is a Nigerian and mother a Mozambican. How the hell is she a South African?
What a disgrace,
Mboro watches too much nigerian movies 😂😂
This are his own grand children. Why is he not allowed to take care of his own grand kids
Stupid one sided reporting.
This is the end of the year realy oh God 😮😮😮 what kind of behavior is that 😢😢😢
This guy is sick he must remain in jail for good
MARUTI WASHLANYA
Guys Watch Full Video Than You Will Understand Why Pastor Mboro He Took This Action I'm Not In His Side But As A Parent You Won't  Watch Your Child Be Beaten By The Whole School In Your Present Com* On Watch Full Video
I think he wanted to act Peter of the Bible, not intentional to harm anyone😅
Jesus is coming soon
Bhovu
Pastor mbolo today is your day u see??? U put bushir in jail today is you
Fafo 😂😂
People have You all seen the whole video about the Pastor??? I have and heard Him accusing those relatives of using drugs when He removed the kid and I only noticed one little boy on the video. Something is going on and especially with drugs mentioned and the disrespect for God's house even though they wanna claim the Pastor is evil... 😮😮😮
Wow that Miss South-Africa looks like She comes from Hollywood and so much like She could be Grace Jones' daughter... 😮😮😮
He is just protecting SA. Because you can trust nothing. To much has been going on in this country.
You ppl who are defending chiddima she's not going to represent you if she wins
I think he is loosing his mind
Lol... The pastor is a foreigner.... lol
Is this the Man of God he claim he is?I doubt it.😟😮
Bible verse 1 John 3:8:  To the world, we declare that humanity is not inherently bad, but rather, we are vulnerable to the influence of evil. As 1 John 3:8 reminds us, 'The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work.'  Let us not blame each other, but instead, recognize the spiritual battle that rages on. Our governments, communities, families, and individuals are not the enemy, but rather, they can be influenced by the enemy of our souls. The devil seeks to destroy, kill, and steal, but God's love and redemption are more powerful.  Let us choose to be influenced by God's love, forgiveness, and grace. Let us break free from the devil's grip and embrace the abundant life that God offers. Our neighbors, pastors, parents, and leaders are not the problem, but rather, they can be victims of the devil's schemes. Let us pray for each other, support each other, and stand together against the true enemy. We are not alone, for God is with us, and His love will ultimately prevail.
Bible states....IF YOU KILL WITH THE " SWORD" YOU SHALL BE KILLED BY THE SWORD....
ARMED WITH AK 47.....IS IT EVEN ALOWED FOR A CITIZEN TO HAVE ONE?
Man of God, my eye. Man of the devil sounds about right
Thank you community😊
Will Gayton be doing due dilligence in every case going forward? We will expect a report from you every year going forward Sir
Jz needs to go to jail. What the heck is wrong with this so called man of God. Not sure what happened but this is not meant to happen. Burning churches and vandalizing is also not from God.  This is a domestic problem not meant for violence. The girl won the pageant fair and square she is beautiful but also we need to make sure south africans are who they say they are when entering under the banner of south africa sbs
What a monster
learn and learn you can't win against Rama in cort
I dont trust this establishment
Gayton could have verified all this before trying to please the masses with misguided statements to show his views on foreigners in this country.Influential people have a bigger burden to influence the right thing than all of us civilians
We are in the time of revealations God want us to realise that these are serving the devil the kingdom of darkness where confussion is rulling these fake pastors
He forgot to solve through the Spirit of God he decided to solve through his power of arm💪🤣😂🤣🤣 deceiver as his father... Like father like son 🤣🤣🤣🤣👌👌👌same whatsapp group halaaaaa 🙌
Are we all ignoring the fact that the dude is carrying an AK-47? Why is there not more of a noise about automatic weapons in hands of people?
haha he's been threatened this one ..... his words should be put before the court . He should be  sued . A whole minister making noise on rumour
"As if we need another sign that there is something wrong in this country" said the presenter🤦🏿‍♂🙈
😮
Jesus Christ will forever be the Lord and saviour,run to him for salvation
Come Sunday they will still go to his church  ⛪️
No ways she is SAcan
This was just a family fued, nothing major to burn his church, like really, this is outrageous
Welcome to Africa .... where everyone is a chief ne ...
Instant karma
Only in africa 😂😂
How does the minister make utterances before a thorough investigation? When the good and the wise take a back seat, the bad and the unwise will take the driver's seat and the crash will be inevitable.
Mboro 😂
The lesson for Gayton McKenzie is to gather facts before commenting as a Minister he has access to the pple who can gather information
The CEO of Miss SA is an Agent of Chaos, She must be investigated.
😂😂😂
Put home behind Bars
This guy hasn't been a pastor in over 10years.
Call CPS !!!
ARREST HIM!!!
South Africa😮 no comment 😮
McKenzie is right, cannot have foreigners stealing our crowns. Unless he's proven wrong, but he has the right to question, as do all of us.
Honestly, Chadima should drop out of the pageant. The fact that the likes of EFF are even pledging financial support to her gives her an unfair advantage.  Judges will feel pressured to score her higher to be perceived as fair.
Our country is a joke n it will continue to be this way..
The miss sa pageant is orchestrated look at previous winners since 2020,one year a black wins and the next year one of the other race groups,ive experienced it ,
He is not a pastor he's a criminal and definitely smuggling if looking at the weapon his body guard is carrying
Nah Pastor that one. Deceiving people. Barbilon
Minister of Sports wa phapha , he comments before he finds the facts first.
Hellen Zille is 100% correct
Lol next minute ewn will be calling asking questions about anc corruption is somehow hatred. Tone deaf EWN
finally he is getting the attention he was looking for
pastor onjani ophatha uphanga mara mzansi 😂😂😂😂
And the racist department of education in GP is only concerned with a white students having a their friends on a whatsapp group.
Panga man
HE'S A MADMAN FULL OF NYAOPE!
Yhoooo😮😮
This is terrorism, the inja pastor must go to prison
This thing of miss South Africa is  making me sick because our people are getting money from these%foreigners that's why they are supporting them liyemka ilizwe sibukele
Mboro is not a Man of God, it shows that God is in control, thank you Jesus
This is garbage reporting, how is this Nigeria a South African. Give us details instead of this sewer news.
If the father is Nigerian n all his kids will be Nigerian they can be South African if the mother was Nigerian n the father was South African the kids will be South African why r we going all round on something we all know so if I make a kid in South Africa n give n my wife give birth to another country it means my kid is not South African
Mc Kenzie has a forward mouth..he must re adjust his mentality..this is not cash in transit..learn to relax when it comes to sensitive matters
eish this fake illegal immigrant pastor from Lesotho
She's not a south African  you're selling this country if you're making her a winner
They did you right boy😂
There's more to this situation than meets the eye....😅
The peeenus was angry😂😂
Pastor really despicable
No hate for the young woman, we SAns heard it wrong and we were thinking about our own participants. Now that it's cleared we apologize. The lady must feel free because, it's not hate .They said father is Nigerian and mother Mozambiquen and we felt where do our girls fit in ,  if everyone from everywhere was competing.  Thanks for the update .
this channel spreads lies,which case ZUMA lost cause case postponed till next year
Why doesn't DA just withdraw from the GNU and become an opposition party instead. This is such an embarrassment to the DA. Just when we thought we will have a calm 5years then Hellen being Hellen start.
The police even thanked the community for burning the church.
Man of god doing Peter things
A man of God would  not conduct himself like this, Beware the wolves in sheeps clothing.
I thought zuma was so sick that he could not go to jail?
Pollution?
I have a question for you “ what about the Sports persons who convert to become Citizens of South Africa and participate in Sports and make South Africa win trophy why can’t you also have question marks about them as well
What kind of a Pastor is this ? What example is he setting for our kids ?
Reading comments whilst pple are mentioning the name, is funny to me as a Zimbabwean 😂💔
Any Zimbabwe here 😂
Did people know about mboro meaning in shona
On the Miss SA issue, Why do you call it hatred ? Are we not supposed to ask questions?
As South African 🇿🇦 I feel ashamed and embarrassed
Miss SA en Nigeria nine drama mzansi 🤞
What did that police officer say
We stand behind that community, they are protecting themselves.
😮 Awa. what now going on. with this pastor
Maybe these guys should not be revered as PASTORS? WTF
One thing about mboro is that he doesn't pretend, he is himself. I don't believe him to be man of God but he is himself unlike many who pretends to be holy than thou Christians.
He Sold  drugs from this tent close to Shcool
CEO of Miss SA is dodgy.  We need independent investigation
SOUTHAFRICAN POLICE FAILED THIS KIDS
Pastor Mbhoro stole the show this week
Bad deal with the Devil (mboro)
Mboro is sick.
I think the pastor is on drugs
His grandchildren?
Correction: Miss South Africa contestant.
What Is That Police Man saying ..🤣🤣
Shut up Zille finally Oudshoring is free of DA , thank you oom Piet!
Arrest his 🍑
These preachers who call themselves pastors are a plague... Being a pastor should require a doctorate of theology from an official university... To many of these false prophets just leach of the poor and are involved in al sorts of crimes including gross sins
why is Kevin Hart swinging that machete?
That machete man is mad and dangerou
😢
We are a light to nations . . . sort of.
The community have practically demonstrated that they don't believe this was a real church. Kudos to the community.
Miss South Africa can yes go to the foreigners just as all the private schools in the country are strictly Zimbabwean territory!!!
These people are all acting, mboro could be recruited by the government to distract us further from the politics and GNU
Pastor 😢 now I know why Christianity on decline
If a pastor can do this in public  i can only imagine the monster he is in his house.
Swift work never happened under ANC rule, VIVA GNU.
😂😂😂😂😂you’re sick braa😂😂😂😂mmdara
HE IS DEFN NOT A GODLY PASTOR.
Lol the samurai pastor😂😅
Pastor who?😂😂😂Mb***
The kids had to go through this 💔
GAZA ... any updates on Palestine 🇵🇸 ?
Obububhanxa behamba bebenza ooMporo buyabaphambanisa ngoku
Ikwerekwere lelo shem
Lol..here is the next politician in the make..next he will be Dr pastor.. Where is child protection services?
That Nigerian girl she is not a South African she must go and represent Nigerian not South African Here father is Nigerian she must go and represent her father's country not South africa She must be removed and the money she got must be taken back she is not South AFI she is Nigerian she must go and represent here father's country and stop telling us she was born here born here don't mean she is South african she must go back to represent Nigerian that's all
Was Mboro arrested for his actions?
If your father is a Nigerian, then you are also a Nigerian...it's that simple.
Not LOST again😂😂😂
I came here after seeing the subtitle,, im from Zimbabwe,, mboro means a penis  in Shona Zimbabwean language 😂😂😂
Fake prophet , This pastor has been around for a long time now and there was something off in him I noticed but it’s fine glad his revealed😭😭💀
Helen Zille need to keep her big mouth shut.
At least JZ isn’t using our money this time for his ‘day in court’.
You dont get Pastor from a piece of paper, you get it from those you are to. And you dont defame in a generalizing statement Media, using it for the clear falsely named such.  So your wrong, for their wrong, does not make a right.
Seriously you can't even sue the president! Our courts are corrupt 😡
Our people are on custard because of stupid poster Mboro
McKenzie must apologize quickly 😂😂😂
And that's brand new pangas😂😂😂 thumbs up for this fake pastor😅😅😅
NSFAS student beneficiaries are committing crime because they are not receiving study Allowances
Zuma needs to kick off his shoes n relax at nkhandhla with the madams
What areas of adjudication was MISS SA Inc vetting? In terms of our national laws, which Miss SA Inc should be subvented to, she is not South African. Minister McKenzie has been investigating for a long time now, the soul of our nation is meanwhile being despoiled.
Thug... pastor
I wish she wins plus she is beautiful😊😊
Izinja zegame bafethu 🔥🔥🔥🔥🫡
