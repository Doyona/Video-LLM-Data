The better and deserving team won the tie/ Ucl last season.
❤❤❤❤❤
W performance
As much as AB saved us, let’s not forget how Van Djik was turned inside out. Yow.
Even the goal came from Alison! 😢
Would love to face psg again next season with the new squad
This is why Ali is our #1 and the best in the world.
People act like it’s just bad defense. No, it’s performance. Exactly how MANSAARNAULT breaks it down
Only Liverpool can beat psg
It wasnt psg vs Liverpool, it was psg vs alison 😂
It's a shame this performance was ultimately for nothing after seeing that game I thought Liverpool would win UCL I thought they'd just grind out any game but sadly for them not. I don't even like Liverpool but that performance from Becker is just so stupidly good, rare for a goalkeeper to be man of the match worthy but he certainly was here.
I can't believe VVD at 0:30
The alisson show😅
ALISSON Deserved to qualify, amazing
PSG absolutely CRUSHED THESE GUYS and they're the best team in the world. (probably) HOW DOES LIVERPOOL PULL THIS OFF!?
Allison is king🌹🥰
Rn even klop can't believe they got disqualified
😂
Liverpool down fall
Psg 0c1 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
After winning all Group stage games with only one loss and 7 wins, 21 points. Liverpool comes and stumble at the Knockout stage. "This indeed is the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE".
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 whats up now
👋 goodbye liverpool you guys are walking alone out the champions league hahahaha😂 remember your place
Se les olvida, a todos los que adoran al PSG ahora, que este equipo paso de milagro, la primera etapa, ahora si fue un legítimo ganador, que extraño es el fútbol, el Liverpool fue el mejor en la primera fase y lo derrota el equipo que avanzo de milagro, pero bueno, el fútbol tiene estas cosas
Who is here after psg won the 2nd leg 😂😂 👇
football won to be Fair, you guys did great in the PL but I felt slot got a little ignorant which was the ultimate downfall in the cl , the better team goes through
I'm glad PSG qualified because Liverpool didn't deserve to go through to the next round
PSG - PSG. PSG LETS GOOOO
PSG BEAT LIVERPOOL 🍺🍺🗿🗿
1-4😂
Bye bye, Anflied must be freezing right now!! PSG was not scared of Liverpool or Anfield, they came to play, didn't they do it so well! PSg is going back to Parc with the qualification in the pocket, also MO in Nuno's pocket.
Now it's "Outrageous Donnaruma performance" 🤣
Who is here after psg won😂?
Stay humble Liverpool 😂😂
A week on....... Ha ha ha ha ha
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣out liverpol
😂1-4
USELESS! Liverpool are consistently inconsistent! Been a supporter since I was 5 [am 63] but only check in now and then as I don't support sports that take the knee and the money saga. So out of another cup they dominated early on! Can never finish the job! lol
We didn’t make it 🥲
Who’s here after psg beat Liverpool..
aged like milk
Donnarumma says Hi, just now
Dar No Win again was the responsible. PSG was better in 180 minutes... bad planification of the Slot
Liverpool will lose 1-4 on pens
Bro is him
Allison became Emi
PSG fans crying that we robbed them. why didnt you take your chances  ？bunch of karens
“Allison with a good hand” that sums it up
where did PSG get the guts to disrespect EPL champions elect like that 😤
YNWA 👏
Beautiful performance from Allison, and Liverpool!
from what I can see if they swapped goalies psg would have like 7 goals and liverpool 0
Alisson the wall😮
Alisson Becker & Shaolin Soccer!!
We miss Mbappe 😔😔
Incredible performance, let's give another GK of the year to Emiliano Martinez for the world cup in 2022 now
The best Gk in the 2025
Im a Liverpool fan, but this commentator is too bias. Don't like listening to him, he's too bias
PSG stadium: Alisson training ground.
This var killed football in some way. They stole a goal from Khvara and PSG.
psg shots on target was 27 and liverpool was only 1 which was goal
Bro cooked..
❤❤
Liverpool❤
This was Alisson. All Alisson. From a textbook clean sheet to a goal contribution. Complete player.
There were 11 people in the goal that night and all of them named Allison.
Allison is BACKER!!!!
Next....Anfield
Harvey Nobody knows what I see Everyone thinks I'm crazy Crazy for you  Oh boy
Alisson Becker ❤ You Beauty 🙌👏👏👏
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Liverpool been so dominated like this before 😮
Day 8 of asking for the best team itw to extend the contract of our king 🤴
PSG had their chances they didn't take them
PSG's midfield in terms of creativity and tehnique is rivaled only by Barcelonas. One of those teams will win or Liverpool if they manage to pass PSG and they dont have to play against Barcelona.
Pls give chiesa more game time❤
Put The chiesa please
I'm football we don't talk of the chances we talk of the scores. Lesson to learn..
Went up once a while, then scored and scorched the other team...
Physically strong forward like Nunez is always useful for Liverpool.
We are not lucky,we are blessed because we never walk alone .
When Jesus says yes ,nobody can say no .Some clubs are not meant to win the champions league.
Vamos Liverpool hoy ganamos contra soton❤
1000
999
998
997
Alisson 🐐
Alisson was just phenomenal! I still think, psg has every chance to go through if they play the same as they did in this game.
PSG so much better than Liverpool . We were very lucky
UCl cup travelling to anfield  this season
If I was slot, I would remove Eliot immediately.. just to poke some people 😂
VAR is cruel
Should be re-titled PSG vs Alisson Highlights
correct
Allison became GOJO in this game
Exactly what real madrid did to us at ucl final
Liverpool is just a better team than PSG.
PSG won w😂 ot. Not Alison in the goal
Please dont sell darwin he is priceless😍✌️
😍😍😍
Donnarumma is so powerfull
チャンスが多くても決めるべき時に決めておかないと高い代償を払うことになる
PSG vs Alisson
Talk about a game Liverpool were meant to lose. Too bad Allison didn't get the memo. What a performance!
Am I just weird but yeah, Alisson made a series of good saves but it's now a few days later and I still can't see where these world class legendary performance saves are. 🤷🏻
Liverpool really shouldn't have won this, PSG would have won 4 0 if... THIS guy wasn't there 😮
Really funny game. PSG were really serious and ended up losing
LIKE.A.ROBBERY  YNWA <3
DARWIZZY NUNEZZZZZ ❤❤❤❤
Neymar
Why Liverpool players come the bench and score 😂
PSG play very well I'll give them a props Liverpool need to step up if they play like that during rest of the season kiss the trophies goodbye
Super Allison, super Liverpool! Thanks God! To be honest, the whole world was against us. I loved it to stay together under huge pressure and take the very possible chance to make it a beautiful end. This is Liverpool, either we are good or bad we always fight to win and do it. It was the most emotional moment and I enjoyed it a lot it gave me a wonderful day smiling the whole day. Thanks, Arne Slot, thanks our boys! YNWA!
As for  Donnarumma, all French TV channels are saying that his weakest point is his Right hand ( which cost PSG matches against ATLETICO, BAYERN, Arsenal and Real ) . Hopefully next Tuesday Liverpool will test Donnarumma on the right
Allison has had a wonderful game and Elliot has scored a brilliant goal so well done Liverpool 🎉.
Alisson solo carried that game
Allison  has to be rated 90 in fc 26
U can hear the announcer going its alisson... Again...
Alisson was one man army ..
How to make a clim? The perfect example😅
Дарвин красава как поборолся какой пас👍
Slot masterclass.. He exceeded my expectations, winning all kinds of games
1.Allison was the best player. 2.There is a very big gap in quality of players,PSG has more quality in every position.Thanks cheap FSG and John Henry for this.
Despite offside ..kvhicha's shot was wonderful
I HAVE got to say that the performance ov ALLISON was world class, PSG would have beaten us if it wasn't for,in my opinion,, best goalkeeper in the world, well done and well played 👍
YNWA 🎉..... Indonesia Night 🫰🫶
Allison Becker is almost as good as Allison Burgers
Allisson❤❤❤
Anfield magic is needed on Tuesday we need to show PSG while Anfield is the most heated stadium in Europe, Another magic night is on the way. Another goosebumps
liverpool giờ chuyển sang chơi phản công rồi ko còn lối chơi tấn công rực lửa như thời của klop
Counter attack 4 sentuhan doank 🔥 saking gemesnya alisson diserang langsung long pass ke lord nunez assist ke elliot 🔥🔥🤭🤭
🇧🇷 ❤
Alisson is the best
❤
Why did they don't show us all the Liverpool chances?
❤ Games like this like 2 shots 1 goal, fortune favours the brave, Allison was immense but top reps to nunez and elliot gotta be there to score
I don't even like PSG, but man, they did not deserve to lose that game.
You robbed us
LOL what is VVD doing at 0:30? "best defender in the world" btw
Guys what are you doing? These highlights are way too long.
Craaaaazy game by King Alisson...probably his finest performance so far
Liverpool panics when faced with PSG's attack
What an assist by Darwin. What a team performance!❤ynwa
Alisson with the saves Alisson with the Goal contribution ❤
I am still not sure how we won...
Wow, no full-width SUBSCRIBE banner for the half of the video. It was my favorite part...
Allison saved a lot of almost impossible saves, and also had a big part in the counter attack that led to the goal. What a player!
I heard the words "From Alisson Again" more than 370 times 😂😂😂  Well done 👏 ❤
Sahur sahur
Tak! Jeg har modtaget crypto (USDT) i min OKX-pung. Hvordan hæver jeg mine penge derfra? Seed:february, ignore, party, lunar, dial, shallow, shift, muscle, flight, long, canoe, unable
with this performance liverpool gonna lose at Anfield. sad thou. im a l'pool fan by the. way
From Alisson to Nunez and to Elliot...gooooollll Amazing❤
Only one team played football, the other one just watched how the game os played. Best team didn't win, again. Champions league should be that, a league, ditch the knock out matches, they are totally unfair and  anti-football prevails. The best team nearly never wins the CL...look at RMadrid last year...total joke.
With all respect to Alisson Becker: Time to remember the real best GK performance in CL: Schalke Porto Manuel Neuer, that's what I call a outstanding game. I think the portugese players still have nightmares.
Alisson 1 vs PSG 0
Don't play like this at anfied pls
🎶Essence - wizkid🎶 🎶Talibans - Byron Messia🎶 🎶Ayra Star - Rush🎶 🎶Me & U - tems🎶 🎶Sip - joeboy🎶 🎶Your number - ayo Jay🎶⚽❤️
Alisson was phenomenal.  I dare say he turned into Lev Yashin that one match.
:)
Alison deserves a damn Statue after that performance.
Nunez, aggressive pressing and dummy running luring the entire defense towards his relentless attack as a target man . only to remain calm and make a silent assist. . . when he had everybody's attention locked onto him. . .his very smart and was always one step ahead
This is not an highlights of the match between Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool, it's an highlights about Alisson Becker.
Thank you LFC, Slot have done a good job but we know Slot  inherited the whole squad Thanks to Klopp excluding Federico Chiesa.   The management team needs to speed up on the contract situation which regards of Mo Salah, Trent and Virgil. We all know these players are still capable of getting the job done. You'll Never Walk Alone.
❤❤
Kvara one should've been a goal😮  Regardless, Alisson a beast
Don't forget about Nunez...
Good videos on my channel too Liverpool yes
Liverpool is a strong team.
아놀드 제발 빼주라
No way we had only 1 attack in this highlight
The only ball Ali didn't catch was offside. Great keepers have great luck too.
Stops all the shots, makes an assist and goes home. Amazing Allison!
QSG fanbois crying in the comments 😂
Alisson❤
High class robbery by Alisson
Na seleção é pé de rato
Alisson OG
come on lads
The only thing Allison can't save is Manchester United 😅
ALLEZ PARIS 🎉❤🥰
The kitchen is beautiful, the Chef make the show, fine dining beauty food,  look perfect...but the taste of food its not Ok. You have to score! Please dont tell me,how good,how nice played Psg. They have to score! I dont wanna eat somethig without taste, just because it's nice!😂
Alisson the saviour 🗿
Ugliest game in a while... EPIC WIN, BOYS, LET'S GO!!!
Match highlights ×  Allison save highlights ✓
Memories goes back, to italian football, in the 80s. 1 shot, 1 goal, 1-0. Game over. 😄
Let’s win this
This was unforgettable performance ❤
The biggest open secret is that Liverpool has a weak midfield. When you see Vitinha collect and distribute balls all over the pitch, you see a midfielder. Someone running opponents and creating space here and there for attackers. When was the last time anyone saw Macca or Szobo do that? Those two are hardly what you can call playmakers. They don't win duels, dribble past opponents, distribute passes about, create spaces for the attackers.  Liverpool's game is virtually very efficient propellers with no engine.  Slot's pass and move game needs very efficient midfielders at the heart of it which is the main ingredient lacking at Liverpool. It is believed we have a good midefield but when did we see Szobo and Macca exert their dominance over the opposition midefield, any calibre of opposition for that matter? Goalkeeper, defense and attack is super good but we definitely need the same quality of midfield but at the moment only Gravenberg shows that level of quality unfortunately.
YNWA ❤❤
Allison🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ОН ПРАКТИЧЕСКИ  отдал ещё голевоой пас 😂😂😂. МУЖЧИНА
i love liver
Thor OF Anfield
Salah must be in substitute next to PSG
Не забиваешь ты, забивают тебе
Mengapa strategy Liverpool mandek pada pertandingan ini. Wing Dan gelandang Tidak hidup. Ada apa?
Nunez great passing too…
hear our fan screaming ❤❤❤
allison peak suddenly come on the  time!!!
Superman who name is Alisson    Becker ❤❤❤
Brilliant pass from Darwin Nunez, Liverpool Forever... YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How horrible performance this was by the reds!
Jelek sekali permainan Liverpool  Untuk apa menang jika dibombardir lawan seperti itu  Kasihan kipernya  Tidak layak juara jika cara bermainnya seperti itu
Alisson - Monster 🔥
Allison 🎉❤
I can watch ths 100times
PSG was outstanding tonight but they were unlucky
0:52 the commentator was gonna say and scores but allison saved it😂😂😂
Congratulations🎉🎈🎊⚽💖🥰🌹🥀,
Watching this match I was jumping and blessing Allison psg was battering us with attack but I commend everyone including our defence
just change the title to "Allison's highlight"
Just give this man the trophy rt way....
It is Klopp's legacy. He built it from 'scratch'.
Liverpool lucky 😂
current number ONE GK IN THE WORLD
I’ve seen enough, barca are winning UCL 🎉😂
Nunez should either not be sold at all or go for loan plz
This team knows how to win!
poor defend by vandijk let dembele free
Liverpool is in safe hands of Alison
1:43 no one talks about the handball by nunez
Now 2nd league in Anfield Liverpool 4-0 PSG 😂😂
Allisson definetly deserves a 10/10 in this match. Just ask uourself the question, what could he have done better? Amazing performance and we should be very thankfull to be 1-0 up insteds of 6-0 down…
liverpool pulled off a robbery....a robbery it was indeed.
Menang atau kalah Liverpool tetap di hati saya... YNWA
Easy win. Psg barely created anything. Simple quiet game for Alisson 🙂
Is everyone gonna talk about bro this man saved 27 shots from psg😅
Lucky Liverpool
0:26 I don't know why, loved this Barcola dribble, don't know why. Please, don't start saying bad things, loved barcola. But man, alisson couldn't have done anything else. He also started the counter attack for the goal
Honestly, I would rather keep Darwin than Diaz
Just let trent go and let bradley play hes already better. Secondly what was this performance by pool
mamang brewok (allison)
Best keeper in the world
If Liverpool play the same way at Annfield, I'm sure they will lose
Alisson would have saved elliot’s shot, thats how good he is
ALISSON BECKER WAS ON FIRE , SAVING SO MANY SHOTS , KEEPING A CLEAN SHEET AND PROVIDED A BRILLIANT PASS WHICH LED TO THE WINNER FOR LIVERPOOL
Alisson's long passes are dangerous...Whoever agrees..hit the like😊
PSG DOMINATED THE GAME FOR 85 MINUTES BUT STILL LOST THE GAME
Welcome To Hell of Anfield (Except 1 match vs Real madrid Where Van Dijk, Konate were injured)..Liverpool will show you what UCL  away game means..  ✅Remember Real madrid won CL Against Liverpool making only shots on targets where Liverpool's 10 shots on target denied by Courtois..  Great Away Win for Liverpool at Paris with victory.  ✅Liverpool have already destroyed Real madrid,  Leverkusen,  Man City,  Ac Milan,  Man U, Chelsea,  RB Leipzig,  Spurs at Anfield this season..  Next- PSG
Somebody has to say great work by Nunez to create the chance for Elliott
HARVEY !!!!!!!!!
endo is the goat
Second leg Liverpool winner 🏆🏆🥇🥇 best of 🤞 luck
Come on Liverpool 🎉❤🤞🏆⚽👐
Has anyone seen how poorly and lazily 'trent' anticipates the opponent's movements?
0:38  Szoboszlai as goalkeeper
Alison !!! No amount of words can describe your heroics
🚫NO VIST RWANDA Logo😅😅😅😅
Our performance was very poor and Alisson saved us from a big loss.
Allison ❤
PSG was the better team, Liverpool got lucky.
Apa yg dipikirkan VVD?? Meninggalkan Dembele begitu saja.
Thumbnail:highlights Video:allison saves😅😅
Jesus was backing Alisson....
It looked to me like Liverpool needed a lot more muscle in midfield and attack. Hey presto Nunez and Endo!
Alisson top performance
I never saw a highlight where the goalkeeper shows up in literally everything. Even our goal started with him. Alisson is my new hero!
Allison not only incredible saves, his first assist led to a goal.
How on earth was that an offside?
I watched every minute of this match well done Allison 👌👏👏Let them receive those shots in Anfield 🛑 Best Club in the World💯
Elliott certainly broke the heart of the steward behind the goal watch him drop on his knees when the ball goes into the net
BORKOLO
Credit to Nunez 🎉🎉🎉
Alisson vs psg
Psg should prepare their defense cause we(liverpool) don't /won't waste our chances at anfield
Allison Becker...🔥🔥🔥
Alison man of the match , eliot hero 🎉
Late video 😢😢
The performance made me so suspicious and incofindent in the team that is able to overcome Paris San Germain
PSG rattled Liverpool. Only player stood firm is Allison.
GODlisson
Liverpool vs PSG❌ Allison vs kvaraskelia✔️
❤❤❤❤
learned from courtois
LFC forever. Anfield is awaiting for PSG. Love this team. Some players (Salah, Gravenberch, TAA(ofensively), Jota) didn't perform at their best. But in Anfield??? We'll be better. PSG is a very good team but not at Liverpool's level
Alisson vs. PSG ft. Elliot
Name a better keeper!
this is truly unbelievable
Lady Luck is with LFC this season.
Support from Russia, we have a gorgeous goalkeeper! Alisson the best! YNWA! Peace!
Well, we played with 12 players, because Alisson played like two goalkeepers
Wasn't for Allison liverpool be 7.0 down,fantastic performance from him 👏
Доннарума мешок
Allison 1 - 0 Psg
And again Allison
Isn't it unfair to cancel a goal because of being offside literary inches? (I'm no fan of either clubs.)
I can't remember when somebody outplays us like a PSG this game! We were so lucky! Alisson magnifico!!
❌ PSG vs Liverpool  ✅ PSG vs Allison
Kvara's goal shows his calf was offside.. but in reality if you watch properly his whole body was offside cos he came from an offside position initially to receive the ball..
ROBBERY
Allison from A-Z
Thank you Alisson
Allison your win brother
They definitely downloaded the real Madrid masterclass before the game 😅
Allison is BEST IN THE WORLD.
Allison , nunez , elliot and endo 🔥
When i was watching Live i thought Nunez would blast that shot up but instead he picked harvey !! almost like Nunez scored !!
They're very lucky. Becker. He is doing well, play good. Congratulations! Liverpool
Ali is the best keeper in the world
A good team always find a way to win nomatter the odds.. Liverpool forever
0:29 what the hell is VVD thinking… school buy stuff
PSG : "LIVERPOOL Please wait, We will come bringing big big big waves!!!"  Liverpool : "No Fear"
That Szobo save lol, Alisson is the best in the world. Great pass from Nunez and nice goal by Elliot
LFC Combined + Allison was im a war torn zone. 0-0 was a miracle. Anfield will Bring the Momentum❤🎉. YNWA
I get goosebumps watching as it was so traumatic for me. ❤YNWA. CAPE TOWN
Crucial save from Szoboslai as well. Dude put his body on the line ..
Alison deserves world best
LIVERPOOL ARE SHIIIIIITTTTR
Everyone is talking how bad liverpool plays or how good Alisson is, but they miss out that it's all Slot's plan. Fully defend first half to make PSG tired,  second half send out Nunez and Elliot for counter. Master piece.🤯
Goalkeeper is a Man of the Match 💪🏾 for Liverpool
I don't remember a better game for Alisson in a Liverpool shirt, simply magic. We need a batter performance in the 2nd leg.
Without Alisson,we would have been lost this match for atleast half a dozen Goals... God bless Alisson Becker...
very delayed with these uploads.
I really don't know how this many people are buying into these things... It's a very good performance by Alisson but to Call this the greatest ever performance by a gk is a Terrible and a Horrendous take... To be very honest I've seen De Gea do even better than this every week in week out at Man Utd throughout his entire time Playing there When The Club were In Their Absolute Lows and probably had the most lacklustre defence in the Premier League.... People don't really see that...
Never seen a game won by such a tight margins
Nuno mendes kept Salah in his circle 😂. PSG showed great performance. If Alison wasn't there, liverpool received 6 to 7 goals. Red card should be handed to konate. Lucky liverpool
this is the best performance for Allison. Never before
This Highlight full  with chance of PSG vs 3 player and one moment
You must feel bad as the goal keeper who let 1 of only 2 shots go in while the other keeper kept out all 26 shots
the Allison Show
Hope at anfeild we will play like the way psg played first leg, toe to toe, the jurgen klopp way.
Gg for you , Alisson was exceptional
i believe we were dominated because we wanted to employ a reserved tactic towards the game,we can compete with this team at our best we just need to show bravery,their defense has weaknesses
Virgil 0,Mo Salah 0...😂😂😂best defender and Striker
liverpool considered "lucky" this match and madrid during the 2022 final was considered a "masterclass" and playing wonderful football.......
Saint Alisson Becker - the new patron saint for (almost) lost causes.
Liverpool were just lucky, PSG dominated the game and possession of the ball, come on Liverpool, use the spirit like playing at Anfield
One of the most difficult matches to watch. Pragmatism won because of Allison's brilliance.
People keep praising Ali for his performance, and fair play to him—it's probably the best performance I've ever seen from a goalkeeper in UCL history. However, let's not get carried away by the dreadful performance of the rest of the squad. It was the worst performance of the season, no doubt, and the worst I've seen in a long time. I think we’re lucky if we manage to get a draw at Anfield!
this is an alisson highlight moc😭😭
Psg well played but. Luck is with Lfc
Still trying to figure out what Virg was doing initially for that triple Dembele/Barcola chance 🤔
Lama amat min upload mya😅
Allison is the fucking GOATKEEPER
May you win the league and the UEFA champions league 🎉🎉
PSG di kasih begitu banyak kesempatan,semata mata untuk menghormoati tuan rumah..Tapi 1 gol Eliot sedang memberi tahu mereka siapa raja sesungguhnya..
PSG are bad as they need 100 chances to score while liverpool have a world class golkeeper. No more no les
If PSG plays this Way they will beat liverpool At anfield....
Best
Just zoom in the time stamp 0:42 and see how passionate sabo
Just zoom in the time stamp 0:42 and see how passionate sabo
So sad that Nunez is leaving
PSG Vs Alison 🥅
Alison makes all those saves but as if that's not enough for him he goes ahead and creates the goal scoring chance. What a man
Darwin is a good lad, a wildcard for sure but the haters will never win as long as we stick together. YNWA.
The difference between 6 stars and zero stars
What a performance from Alison! 📈
Let psg come experience anfield like Barcelona
Not only did he make the saves but he set up the goal too - man o man!
Another day of Ali's vision..😂
PSG made Long Ball FC sit on there box and pray 😂😂
PSG got Robbed by Haram Pool FC
Liverpool Vs PSG ❌ Alisson  Vs PSG 🧤✅🗿
PSG dominated possession but still lost 😂
Oh Alli..U Beauty ❤️❤️❤️
No striker, no midfielders, no defender only Gk Alison beker on fire ❤❤️‍🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
PSG only had Xg 1.85. which means their quality of attack was not really that great as people are exaggerating about. And no it wasn't a undeserved win for Liverpool. Liverpool chose the defensive tactic. In contrast we had Xg 3.92 against Man United (Xg 0.5) last year but ended up  drawing 2-2. We had Xg 2.3 against Real Madrid (Xg 0.6) in the final but ended up losing 1-0. We raked hihi Xgs so many times...indicating the quality of chances but many times we ended up losing points. I did not see anyone saying Liverpool was robbed isn't it?
Please don't play like this anymore, only Allison played well yesterday, please win by 2/3 goals next leg otherwise real will thrash us
Alisson was soo good in this game he even created the chance for that goal
Nobody's talking about Dom's block on Barcola shot after incredible save by Ali
Taffy game was not easy
Thank you Darwin, once more you've shown your worth
Not gonna lie psg is scary
People debating whether Alisson is better than Onana. This video should help with that decision.
Alisson is a Hero!
Psg played better. Alison saved Liverpool
Psg winning second leg
Bravo PSG!  😎💪👍 Liverpool - PSG 0-2
Man our rest of the players were sure invisible through out the whole match.
❤❤Allison Blocker ❤❤
word class
Give me your shirt ali..😊
알리송이 다 했네ㅋ
Liverpool can't win champions League if they continue this Way
PSG vs Allison
Salah and Jota and Diaz couldn't run pass their markers. Monster PSG played like Klopp's Liverpool prime. Our midfield was suppressed. We definitely need younger legs with spring.
Alisson save the embarrassing performance our midfield attack.
Psg - Allison 0:1:)
So basically Alisson Becker, Nunez and Elliot (of all people) saved us from the embarrassment… PSG gave us a major whopping, but couldn’t convert due to our marvelous Ali. 🙏
First touch first on target , first goal😂😂😂😂😂😂
Becker deserved MAN OF THE MATCH for this incredible match performances.
Allison the wall
AHAHAHAHA
Good Job
Liverpool is lucky to survive the ordeal. it could manage to create only one shot on target.
Hats off to Allison. His heroic exploits saved the day for Liverpool.
van d and konate played awfully, but Alison😊❤
All credit goes to Liverpool goalkeeper...his lifetime best...thank you brother.
my goalkeeper's father
Liverpool fans can understand what psg fans are feeling rn
A calm Darwin is the best Darwin! Us Liverpool fans in Japan support the whole team come what way! Ganbare! Arigatou. YNWA
Good strategy and great decision. Liverpool fc❤ champion league
Nunez - Elliott combo were save us again.
Smash and grab. Always wondered why Klopp didn't utilise counter attacking speed much more eith such lethal players
The Best Alisson
🏆 league for you Liverpool
MORE KUDOS LFC🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰
Beast from brazil AB1❤
Alisson... Nunez-Elliot... PERFECT!!!
Fair deal, it should be 5-1, if A1 were not here!
God loves you Alisson Becker❤😊 and we love you 😎YNWA
If it was Ederson, it would've been 5-0 atleast
Every dominant team should have at least one game they're defending like gods
More like PSG vs Allison
The commenatry is so dull ...no life
Liverpool didn't win by luck but true spirit of winning the game. Psg was all over but Liverpool denied them. You have be best to beat the best.
my god Alisson, is the best!
Lucky bastards
Alisson also started the attack for Liverpool to get a goal😂
Bro Allison legit saved Liverpool from a 10 - 0 thrashing g😂
Liverpool club should give a reward in the form of a contract extension to players over 30 who give an extraordinary performance and have a hard work ethic and a humble attitude, because this will have a sustainable impact on young players or academy players where they will see that their future will be long and bright at the club as long as they give an extraordinary performance and work ethic and a humble attitude, and this will provide long-term benefits for Liverpool club itself, especially their mentality will feel like they have and love the club, and this factor is an extraordinary motivator for humans to bring out more power
Offside rules need to change 😅!!!??
Allison vs PSG
No tension No worries Just cool as always... that's Allison ❤
Alisson Man Of The Match
Allison also booted the ball forward to Nunez for the goal! What a game he had!
I could save that
OMG! Even the goal Allison has something to do with it! What a game from the man!
psg have more chance lmao
Always an epic game with Liverpool.
Alisson is pure spiderman!
First high ball played into the PSG defence and 4 defenders cannot deal with it or Nunez, leaving Elliott wide open.  If I'm Slot, I know what I will do at Anfield 😊
Roma had both schnzeny and allison at same time but still couldn’t solve their goalkeeping issue
Highlights Alisson vs PSG
Becker is a beast
"Alison Becker, quite simply the best in the world at what he does...And AGAIN Alison..."
Godlison
Alisson is the best gk in the world
oh my god
Title should be like "saves by Allison
1 chance 1 moment and 1 goal
Donnaruma, overrated and always was. And full of himself.
Offside goal from PSG? That man didn't participated in the play at all. Liverpool was really lucky....
I love Nunez. Really, I mean it
AB traumatized PSG lol
Fzckkk Alisson saved it and assisted the goal
WE'RE JAMMY C.... WE'RE JAMMY C.... WE'RE JAMMY C....................  WE COULDN'T CARE LESS, IF WE'RE JAMMY C.... 🤣  FINISH THE JOB. LFG. UP THE MIGHTY REDS. YNWA JFT97.  🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤
Alisson amazing!!!!
Please every angle elliot gol vs PSG
No one talking about Nunez assist
Alisson in GOD mode
It was funny how some people who never watched the game called it a Defensive Masterclass from Liverpool. Alison just channeled his inner Oliver khan, Peter Cech, Schmeichel. What a Goalkeeper!
Evething will be able to happen in the blink of an eyes
Let’s go RED❤️
Liverpool needs  young players as Elliot.
hopeless playing style, you can't always depend on alisson ..!!
Alisson bekerja dengan sangat baik meskipun pemain lain bermain buruk
Just Lucky to get win.Psg were dominant
Always made fun of Nunez, but this time i want to give credits where it's due, other players might've taken the chances on their own, but Nunez kept his calm and making a great decisions to pass to Elliot, respect.
psg need to destroy liverpool in anfield.. psg are obviously miles better than liverpool. 30 shots to 1!!
Nunez Nunez Nunez!!!!!
Alisson's master class - he will NEVER better this performance!
Allison MVP
Thank you team!
2025.03.07.                   2:10
😎😎😎😎
🤯🤯🤯
You mean PSG and ALLISON highlights, Liverpool highlight. Liverpool get humiliated and still win 😂.
Allison is top top player this night.. nunez assist is very important.. that why we need him.. he will make the defender nervous even he not score
How lucky was Liverpool?
Alisson vs psg
Hail to the Slot (Killing) Machine! 🤟YNWA
Here's to the holy goalie
Briiliant from arne slot, bring in nunez and elliot, makes psg defender disoriented
This is a very stupid game  Arne don’t keep this playing strategy if you need a trophy 🏆  You really performed woefully 😢 We’re Liverpool 💪🏼 600/200 total touches in ball possession is a bad game  Let’s be sincere 💯 Don’t think about the lucky win 😡
What a terrific long pass by Alisson to Nunez! Superman!
I must say we were lucky a little. I am glad Alisson saved us in this match, but at home we need to improve our ball possession and try to make more chances.
Allison 𓃵
He saves them all for Liverpool, He’s never gonna stop, Nine saves against the boys, He’s reaching for the top, From Roma down to Anfield, He’s standing tall and strong, With Ali in our goalposts,  We're winning all night long!  Ali Ali Ali!  Ali Ali Ali!  Ali Ali Ali!
Alison against PSG
This is the most terrific and worst game of Liverpool this season,hope it will be the last
Should’ve included Konate’s challenge. It was a significant moment in the game.
This match proves that there is a God who is controlling this universe of ours. 😧😮😯😲🙀
What a great performance from Alisson, this match reminded me of the Liverpool vs Real Madrid Champions League final 2021/22, the scenario was very similar to this match ❤
If Donnarumma had a tenth of Allison's night performance that goal would have never be in.
gooooooo
One Shot it's all it takes to win against PSG because Allison is all we need.
Trent needs to do better. He always switch off once someone dribble pass him.... Come on man
Allison❤️
Can we keep alisson forever
Enrique out-smarted Slot tactically. The way PSG found space between Liverpool was incredible.
Saves and assist (kinda). what a man. proud to have him in the squad. one of the players that jurgen bought that truly function.
Alisson the best keeper in the world 🐐 ❤
Football is cruel
I pray for us during the second leg because if we host with this performance, it's over 😅  Psg would trash us but I trust my boys we'll always walk together ❤️
Good var, not like in liga Indonesia 😂
Liverpool  എന്തേ പ്പം ണ്ടായേ😅 ഒരു ബോംബ് രണ്ട് ബോംബ് തുരുതുരാ.. 😂😂Allison what a performance man
Literally Ali vs PSG. What a beast AB1 is. But I also give credit to our subs Endo, Nunez and Elliott for making a difference. Was a bad performance, but let's still build on from this win. YNWA🔴❤️
Allison....You beauty
70.5% vs 29.5% 27 shots, 10 on target vs 2 shots, 1 on target 🎯 9 saves 🙌🏼🧤🥅⚽🥅💪🏼💯👍🏼  P.S: Liverpool did and done a defensive end offensive performance. Will they play an aggressive and attacking technique in the 2nd leg?
Absolutely beautiful performance Alison  so nice off great save. 👍
I hope Slot figure it out how to beat PSG at Anfield
Wow this was simply my career mode as keeper  liverpool had no highlights
Opposition fans conveniently forget Liverpool's 23 shots to Madrid's 1 that was their winning goal in the 2022 CL final. Everyone laughed at Liverpool and said Madrid are true champions. Now doing the same against PSG they are just lucky. Congratulations my lfc❤
❤
I will give 9 trophies that night . That save after we’re  amazing
Darwin comes on and creates a chance!
We were so lucky konate didn't get a red card, that was a clear foul imo.
I hadn’t realized Allison also provided the long ball to Darwin to assist Harvey. Incredible performance!
PSG 😂
It wasn't the best game Liverpool had, but this is why I love this team ❤❤they never give up
Liverpool life ❤
🐬
Alli was magnificent, Trent had an excellent game defensively wise imo, as did a couple of other players. It’s been a while since we’ve seen liverpool under pressure like that, but a win is really all that matters in the end. Thought the subs were the difference makers, darwin, Harvey and wata all made big impacts. Focus on Saturday now lads 💪
These highlights did Alisson dirty. Show all his saves!
Darwin "Pelé" Núñez and Harvey "Carlos Alberto" Elliott!
When the opponents think they have the advantage, Liverpool suddenly unleashed the final blow against them. Bam
If only Onana was half of Alisson.
❤❤❤❤
You will never see a better goalkeeping performance in your life than this one by Alisson Becker.
The worst offside I ever seen.
Selamat buat Liverpool FC
Harvey Elliot and Darwin Nunez always come up with something when they get subbed on
Thanks the referee corrupted little club
🌷👍
PSG were slick and dominant. Wow!!
Alisson the best in the world
LİVERPOOL İS ❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:52 now this was very impressive.
If it was Onana we would come bck 9-0 down😅 Thank you Alisson🔥
Salah worst performance so far.
Alison vs PSG
Can we all take a Moment to appreciate Endo Though  Man came on and Shut down PSG ,Gave us that extra bit of control in midfield
Let's meet here again when liverpool wins the premier league and champions league❤
❤Allison ❤
Godlisson
PSV are likely to smash Liverpool at the end
allison layed well but its highley unlickley he will have another 10 out of 10 performance against psg,at anfeild we must do better or else we will lose
00:29 Virgil's miss? Why did Virgil go after Dembélé for a sec, then ditch him and head back to his place?
craziest game in a long time
El factor suerte existe en el fútbol y mucho
A signing made 7 years ago still paying dividends. I'm so glad Ali is a red.
Upload longer videos
The real shaolin soccer keeper..... Shaolin becker👻😎
Allison
เรารักนายอลิส
Liverpool just posted an Allison reel
Weak from Donnarumma. Allison saves that Elliot shot
Liverpool played absolutely horribly lmao. We are lucky to not be heading into the second leg with a 4 goal deficit.  Allison was the sole reason we scraped thru
Darwin Nunez ❤
pocong go internasional
Alisson is Definitely one of the successful goalkeepers in the planet
Alisson simplesmente tampou o gol kkkkkkkkk, isso é bizarro po
congrats to Luckypool
This is legit Alisson Highlights 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Becker👍
Absolutely majestic performance from Alisson, the best ive ever seen from him in a Liverpool shirt
LFC❤
Allison first  Darwin second  Elliott third
Alisson Becker🫡🫶
Alisson Best Goal Keeper but dont know why they were slacking off in defence and leaving it up to Alisson.  Really guys, team effort needed in defence not just in attacking !!!
Indescribably wonderful - huge ups to Liverpool and Alisson (from a City fan...). Cheers.
Alisson won the Champions League MVP "again" this season. He is the best goalkeeper by far and a Liverpool legend
I think the caption should read PSG vS Allison! That was absolutely magnificent
remember Alisson also provided that long ball to Darwin...
If Liverpool win the League and UCL then this performance alone from Allison should push him up for Balon Dor contender.   I am an arsenal fan. 😊
Thanks Alisson
Thank you Darwin for denying yourself of being the real you that would have blasted the ball impulsively instead you waited and weighted a pass turn assist. Kudos Darwin.  Allison  Vs PSG was the game yesterday. Lucky PSG, we didn't field the remaining 10 players against them
Psg nuh av a chance
😅😅😅😅❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤1 Liverpool
PSG vs Alisson Becker 😅
Liverpool Football Club ❤❤❤
Can’t believe how bad psg were in this game
🎉ลิเวอร์พูลสู้ต่อไปครับท่าน😊
Alisson VS PSG
he was even involved in the goal!
Respect to both teams
Liverpool own Alisson Becker big time
السون بيكر المنقذ 😊
never in doubt 😎
😂😂😂 only 1:51 minute  of highlights a win is win but they are lucky it's not even they defended hard only alison 😂😂 was saving to much
Peter Schmeichel saying its one of the best goalkeeping performances he has ever seen was no exaggeration, Ali single handedly conquered Paris. Colossus.
I've frozen the video at the point of the pass to PSG goalscorer and he had gotten back onside considerably sooner than the ball left the passer's foot. That goal should have stood for PSG.
donaruma:D i remember when he replaced keylor navas.  karma...navas was somewhere else..than this
See full match highlights on DAZN: Dominik Szoboszlai TWO saves: 30th minute in front of open goal and 62nd minute at near post on PSG corner
🎉
Ali’s performance was outstanding! I really hope his effort pays off and that we go on to win the championship.
Hi
PSG. All that dominance and they end up getting panicked by Nunez and letting Elliott have a free run on goal.   Unbelievably incompetent given the rest of the overall performance, especially when it's 0-0 with 3 minutes to go.
Alisson will never let you go any where
VAR ruined football   How on earth first goal an offside
Becker is more than goalkeeper
Outrageous Alisson vs Napoli. Outrageous Alisson vs PSG.  Hello champions league. You know what I mean.
Good  play😊😊
Se é do interiorrrrrr do bruasill
Alison Becker man of the much
Alisson
Nem de são Paulo se é
Alisson the TOTAL PLAYER,  he stoped all and assisted clue for Elliot's goal.
How many us noticed the camera man across the post, how he knelt down immediately Eliot scored...
Why does it have to take so long to upload highlights 😢?
The thumbnail should be Alison vs psg 😅. What a performance 🎉
Cengkareng hadir
YNWA
Elliot game winner
The Alisson Becker Show!  I’ve always said that Alisson and Van Dijk are among the most important players in Liverpool’s history. From the moment they arrived, they transformed our defense completely. Though Alisson had a bit of a slow start to the season, yesterday’s performance was a powerful reminder that we have the very best in the world between the posts. What a goalkeeper! 🔥🔴
Darwin Nuñez passion
Up the Reds
Beautiful saves Alisson
Still psg will go through
Refs won this one for us, boys. We've got to step it up
I can't say how below average LFC midfield players, only running without any effect, missing pressing, even can't They pass properly, even i don't say position. Really slot should stop benching Darwin, chieza and Eliot for a players only running without do anything, it's been more than 6 matches i don't enjoy LFC playing style, entire matches i watching opponent attacking and LFC doing nothing
Come on Reds
Amazing Alisson
Alisson Becker ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I Love Liverpool
Alison becker best gk in the world💥💥
You"ll Never walk alone
Very bad game of Liverpool, Salah is sleepy and underperforming, he is very weak and avoiding confrontation which is a really bad behavior, unlike Darwin who is energetic and strong, Allison is absolutely MOTM
Carlo Ancelotti was very right. Champions league games aren't played, they are won
Good luck guys
Liverpool Forever
Come on Reds
Yesterday's match was all about Allison.
The real great teams have great keepers. We got the best keeper in the world!
Incredible saves Alisson
Watching for Brasil
Good Performance Alisson
As a wise man once claimed, "When your goalkeeper is MOTM, you have a problem"
Up the Reds
Happy for Darwin
Im little worried bout second leg
Another game, another proof TAA is NOT liverpool quality. And endo is the core of our midfield. Quicker slot sees that the better.
Alisson Legend
You"ll Never walk alone
Support from Brasil
PSG just very unlucky
FOR THIS MATCH ONLY, I take back 6.66% of the bad things I've ever said about Becker. I also take back 3.33% of the bad things I have said about Nunez but again for the goal-scoring play only. Excellent concentration to knock it down, follow it to get it back and awareness of space and the run from Elliot. You know though that if Nunez had been on the RECEIVING end of that pass from someone else, he would have totally missed the shot. Dominik Szoboszlai with the save but also luckily the rebound thumped over between the other 2 defenders.
27 shot PSG - 2 shot Liverpool  Salah was just spectating the whole match
Last night 🎼Allison saved my life 😊🎼... From arsenal and man useless fans
Alhamdulillah Redsss
Even Alisson, almost had an assist  (if nunez scored) Wow! But still brilliant involved in final third 💯💯👏👏
How does Liverpool win these games is beyond me. They get outplayed by many teams. All they do is park the bus and wait for the counter attacks. That outside rule is ridiculous, it needs to be changed. Allison was a beast! Nunez might not be a scorer, but his effort and fight for every ball is second to none. Diaz needs to be benched. He has not done much for a long time.
lets gooo we won
PSG doesn't have a Szoboszlai...
Allison and refree gave masterclass  That was clear pen but they robbed psg
Alison is the best goalkeeper to exist
nunez ❤
What bad performance we do against PSG 😢😢
AB top notch performance! That offside though, was quite controversial.
Win is a win any which way.
PSG should have won LOL. A steal.😅
greatest performance ever.
umpan allison ke nunez kemudian ke elliot dan gol
PSG are a really strong side, we done very well to come away with the win, won't be easy next week but Anfield has to be at full voice to get through
Slot's neck was again saved by the assistance of NUNEZ...to Allison.
Having Ex Manure & Neverton players commentating on a LFC game is horrible PR for TNT. Who chose them to do commentary on the game in the first place? Stevie Wonder? Bunch of jokers I swear
Rigged konate a clear red and Nunez clear red to donnurumma
Despite the victory, I detested the performance of the team I hope they improve and become more aggressive on the next Tuesday
Alison Alison Becker your the goal keeper in the world ❤❤❤❤❤❤
مباراة عجيبه . باريس سان جيرمان يلاعب فقط اليسون. اعتقد مامن مهاجم من ليفربول لمس الكرة داخل منطقة الجزاء. غير اللاعب صاحب هدف المباراة. حقا أنا مستاء من أداء ليفربول في هذه المباراة. وأتعجب من هذا الأداء. اليسون هو رجل المباراه بلامنازع. أنا مصري. أشجع ليفربول من أجل صلاح ❤
Allison, DarWIN, Elliott, thank you!!
サムネ良き
Allison has proved himself that he is the best goalkeeper in the world
We must win 3-0 at home to forget this bad performance
Not sure if this is a highlight for the match or a highlight for Alisson Becker's saves 😂
Worst shot ever by elliott.... terrible keeping
Liverpool plays like a 3rd division team😂😂😂
We watched a goalkeepers highlight not a match highlight 😅
He said in an interview that this is in his opinion the best game he played. YNWA
How luckiest Liverpool is...PSG vs Ally...
U got lucky 🍀
PSG best team in the world right now.
Liverpool fc did to PSG what Real Madrid did to them in UEFA champions league final in 2022.😂
Wallison Becker, well done lad
soo lucky win lads!!! PSG was a beast!
I want a full reel of everything Alli did this game😊
❤❤❤
Psg vs Liverpool ❌ Best Allison saves✅
Not just saved the team but participated in the goal too 💀 What a beast
Broo  PSG is going to the next round if Liverpool FC play bad again
if all player under perfomance, but nunez always save liverpool 😂
Alisson💪
How many times psg attack from the sides cut in. Defend the cut ins....
As a french, Alisson was a beast. No wonder why he's the best goalkeeper in the PL right now, hence the best goalkeeper in Europe.  I won’t be surprised if Liverpool will win the UCL this season.   They have this mentallity of winning in very tough matches since ages like Real Madrid, whereas PSG lacks a lot (Even though it’s a different story).  But I know PSG will win against a bigger club with this mentality one day.   It’s gonna take a long time (like Man City) but I'm sure they will win this trophy, one day.  Cheers.
When my son grows up and asks who Alison Becker was, I’ll just show him this highlight reel.
We should also give credit to Endo our samurai.
Very rich performance from Allison
Absolute cinema
Got to one of best games I've witnessed since the Barcelona game at Anfield. I love the BBC highlights commentary on this game, where the commentator said "Liverpool's goal is living a charmed life"
Sometimes you need a little bit of luck 😀 YNWA
Beautiful from Alisson..... incredible One of the best Goalkeeper in the world... brilliant saves and fast reflexes...also  good set up for Nunez to set up Elliott for the goal ❤❤❤❤ YNWA
Allison becker's highlight
I love my team Liverpool but PSG  performance was splendid those guys were attacking
Never compare Allison to Donnaruma Ederson ever
Ліверпуль був не схожим на себе. ПСЖ  був кращим по грі. Я кажу це як вболівальник Лівера, але його гра не надихала. Треба додавати.
Congratulation the reds...👏👏👏👏👏
❤❤❤❤
PSG for revange 🎉❤
That goal made me tear up. I might need to reevaluate my life lol
aliison on fire
Liverpool will crush PSG at Anfield next Tuesday
Bravo Liverpool 🎉
Alternative title: Alisson Becker's Career Night
Very nice game ❤❤
La grande équipe qui défend tout le match decu
making us wait a whole day for barely 2 min long highlights is lazy and greedy, do better.
IMDB: 9.2 GENRE: HORROR, THRILLER FILM A NIGHT OF TERROR IN PARIS SYNOPSIS:               A docker from England travels to Paris to receive the "Best Worker" award for which he has dreamed. Thinking that everything will go as planned, the Englishman realises that something is wrong the moment he lands at the Paris airport. Nothing will be as he expected. This film is about a group of black people who, in order to make their Arab, oil-rich bosses happy, resort to brutality to eliminate their strongest rivals one by one in order to eliminate their rivals who are likely to win the "Best Worker" award, and it is the turn of the Englishman to meet a yellow taxi driver and fight with them. This film, where you will feel the horror and especially the tension to the end, is a perfect masterpiece especially for those who love this genre...  -Spoiler-  At the end of the film, a bald American comes into play and defeats the blacks. The famous director leaves the end of the film open-ended and conveys to us that the story does not end here. Let's see how the 2nd film will be...  YNWA'1892   GO LIVE...
This Liverpool I don't want to see in the second leg. Coz wow. Allison had a great game ..but that actually says a lot about the team than the goalie
What a game.  Endo destroyed PSG midfielder Nunez run, duel, and assist Elliot touch and goal And of course the hero Allisson, the 1st GK in the world teaching 1st GK in Europe ( donna) how to make save and cleanshet.
Slot is overrated
Classic smash and grab. I'm happy for the win but please don't play that terrorismo football ever again.
YNWA
Psg vs Allison 👍
Stop uploaded results later you
Alisson❤❤❤
PSG น่ากลัวมาก😮😮😮
its nice and fine but lets be honest, we all know the reason why it was less than 2 minutes this time, even our u18 got more screen time XD
Luckiest team of this yead
Plz let trent play in mid , he is very weak .. plz save our journey in UCL
yeaaaaaaaaaah get in lads we know the score we are european royalty
Our ugliest win ever Thanks for Allison
YNWA ❤
Allison kept us in the game and he also created the chance for the winning goal
Liverpool is trash agaist psg.PSG performance is far better then liverpool❤
Nice save from Szoboszlai...
Liverpool played with 9 players because Diaz and Mo were just ghosts in this match!
Allison is number one world class goal keeper
Outstanding performance from Alison 🔥🔥🔥 Nunez assist and that lovely finish from Elliott was fantastic
Great performance from my team. Thanks! No but most seriously I dont ever wanna see that again except Alisson's performance.
PSG กดดัน Liverpool 😮😮😮
The Wall🧱❤️ Al in Paris🔥
The best goelkeeper in the world
How many times have Liverpool battered teams , had over 20 shots at goal , and got beat by a single goal near the end of the game , its about time we had some luck, and the hand of god in goal for us , we did not steal the game , PSG , just did not win it ,
You have respect for Alison but don't forget Nunez and Elliot,, basically good team work from Liverpool....
PSG players went back home  while sleeping they had a nightmare and again it's Alisson.
This is the calm, composed and decisive Darwin we need. Happy for him and Elliot and the whole squad and all lfc fans worldwide
We never play well after a break. These lads need to play football all the time, they're that good at it.
Ali was superb and Nunez and Elliot stepping up when needed. Fantastic lads!
I member when Alison give Liverpool live vs Napoli
That ball is from Alison to Nunez to Elliott
very good very well🔥
Psg vs Alison
Man of the match Allison Becker
So this is a highlight of Alison making great saves and Alison assisting the only goal! Great
A miraculous 1:0 thanks to amazing Alisson. It's incredible that we had a whole week and this was the best what we've managed to cook.  On a side note, majority of us, fans, were asking for Kvartaskhelia at Anfield for almost last 2 years. Sadly we are getting him as greatest threat, instead of greatest asset.
UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE
None of the saves were ''world-class'' - they were just very, very good saves that you would expect a top keeper to make. They were all within reach and he did what you would expect. PSG's shooting was poor (apart from the one which was disallowed!).
Is it Allison Becker or Allison ghost 😮
Incredible performance from Alisson but also good vision from Darwin to set up the goal.
Notice Alission was also involved in the goal what a keeper
Wara LUCKERS same as in PL. Incredible
Frustrated Paris
Forever a Red🟥❤️‍🔥🙌
Is this the match highlight or Alisson save compilation 😂😂
Let's be clear: beyond Alisson praise, we won't always be lucky. We must be more attentive at Anfield. ❤ YNWA
One of the best goalkeeping performances of all time.
Please tell me we're getting an "Every Angle" video for Harvey's goal???
Alisson Becker turned into Lev Yashin! <3
I wonder why you always so late uploading highlights 😞
Simply beautiful, thank you Alisson for the saves and helping with the goal...
Get in Liverpool we’re very lucky this game it was very difficult for Liverpool PSG was a great team what game form Liverpool FAN
Liverpool are just lucky 🙄🙄
I loved this win! Honestly PSG played a very good game, but they didn't generate a ton of grade A chances, and when finishing was decent Alisson was there. Liverpool always had the chance to win thanks of him and man I loved that Elliot goal! Great win lads looking forward to the home game on Anfield
1:52 of highlights. That’s say it all. Poor performance. Thanks to Alisson and the ref
keren
Alison was all dressed up like a fighter! Knowing Liverpool was going to be tortured, he came so prepared. Thank you Alison and the whole squad for bracing up defensively.
Muhammed Alli(son) rope a doped PSG just like George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle. So happy for Darwin - battled to win the second ball, then perfect weight and placement for Harvey to curl it into the corner. Harvey started his run inside Liverpool's half and just ghosted past Mendes. YNWA
Please don’t give a lot of chances to PSG in next match at Anfield
❤ Harvey lad ❤ Ali B
Darwin slowly redeeming himself with a well weighted pass there.
the way darwin nunez didnt give up and had that energy to score a goal but he didnt but got an assist the passion♥
Insane performance by Alisson Lovely combination by Elliott and Nunez Just special ✨
Honestly folks, it takes nearly 24 hours to upload a 2 minute video?
Alisson Becker enjoyers and enthusiasts gather here
I ALMOST PEED MY PANTS ( isweartogud)❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉YNWA
Goalkeepers will be more powerful as they get older, experience in goalkeeping is higher than young goalkeeper , Alisson is the best Brazilian goalkeeper in the world ❤️ LETS GO TO ANFIELD 🔥 YNWA FROM MALAYSIAN 🇲🇾🔥 THANKS TO ALL FANS COME TO PARIS FOR SAPPORT LIVERPOOL PLAY , ILOVEYOU SO MUCH   for representing us who are far away ❤️ Remember we are all always there , you guys never walk alone ❤️ SORRY IF MY ENGLISH IS BAD 😭🙏🏼
It's a robbery. PSG dominated Liverpool throughout the match, it's unfair. Our Parisians won't give up and will fight at Anfield. They will have possession, they will dominate and they will do everything to score and qualify. The most deserving team lost. I'm not going to cry about the refereeing but Konate should have been sent off in the 30th minute.  I'm proud of PSG. No team could dominate Liverpool like the Parisians did tonight. The only Liverpool player who deserves to be congratulated is Alisson who saved Liverpool from humiliation.  We'll see what happens in the 2nd leg. I think the team that wins on Tuesday will probably play in the Champions League final.
allison cold moments
Honestly 0-0 would have felt like a 2-0 win after seeing 27 shots come at us. So a 1-0 win is a next level result! ❤
Alison was INCREDIBLE last night
total PSG shots = 27 , total liverpool shots = 2, this is funnny and amazing
There should be a proper highlight reel just for Alisson for this match. What a player what a performance. YNWA
we showed kvara who he rejected
Given another team how it feel like dominating the whole game and still losing 1:0, flashback of what happened in the 21/22 ucl final versus Real Madrid.
I love my team ❤
allison was built different in this match
we dominated all the game
Alisson is our hero without cape, YNWA
The Allison show 💪
If it isn't my people doing it again!Alisson had an outrageous perfomance anyways much love🤩😍❤‍🩹❤‍🔥
If we win the UCL this is gonna be the best Liverpool team of all time
Wish I could play for the team 😢
Ali best GK in the world ❤
The Holy Golie best in the world Allison 🔥
Goalkeepers will be more powerful as they get older, experience in goalkeeping is higher than young goalkeeper , Alisson is the best Brazilian goalkeeper in the world ❤️ LETS GO TO ANFIELD 🔥 YNWA FROM MALAYSIAN 🇲🇾🔥 THANKS TO ALL FANS COME TO PARIS FOR SAPPORT LIVERPOOL PLAY , ILOVEYOU SO MUCH   for representing us who are far away ❤️ Remember we are all always there , you guys never walk alone ❤️ SORRY IF MY ENGLISH IS BAD 😭🙏🏼
alisson man of the match
Beautiful assist from Darwin Núñez.❤
Not enough praise can be heaped towards Alisson, but this whole squad is incredible. When the starters are having a tough time, Jones, Nunez, Endo and Elliott just comes on with determination, hard work and instant impact. Warriors FC. Arne Slot once again with the super subs. What a coach we have.
Today you are to late🥳🥳🥳
Darwin 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alisson Becker ❤❤❤ hello Liverpool
Alisson on fire🔥
Nunez for me 🎉🎉🎉🎉 That pass was something else, it is now over for them
Absolutely beautiful preformance from Allison , this man saved Liverpool
I love this club YNWA
❤❤❤❤allison
This is exactly how Liverpool felt in the 2022 champions league final against Courtois
Alisson Incredible Saves..
Kommer så Liverpool vi skal vinder Premier League og Champions League og Liga Cup i denne sæson
Alisson was in BEAST MODE🔥🔥🔥
Excellent Save From Alisson The Brazilian Sensational + Goal From Harvey Elliott.   After Defeat In UEFA Champions League  Grup Stage Season 2018-2019 Liverpool FC Winners Against Paris Saint-Germain  In The Parc Des Princes Stadium  Score By 0-1.   Commentator : John Bradley.
Liverpool forever ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations Liverpool
Compare Alisson with a wall next time 🐐
Alli is the best Goalkeeper in the world
Great performance for PSG. They should be more clinical next time. Great performance from Alison who saved his team. From a parisian fan
Poor performance except for Alisson but great away victory ❤
Brilliant performance from Alisson. Like if you agree. (Just so you know I'm not that kind of person just looking for likes I actually believe Alisson Did exceptionally well)
Hi liverpool 😂
Luck? NO! Allison's Masterclass ✅  Arne Slot Substutions ✅  Pray for PSG at Anfield 🙏
❤
