This happened to me recently - I was listening to Amyl and the Sniffers and then I turned down my song only to hear it playing in the background - then I realized they were playing Way Out West live in Sweden same time as I was listening to them at home.
Yo iba a hacer lo mismo. 😂

Smh. Why do people always need to invade others privacy/personal space and record every little thing for views, man. You can't even look up a song in peace without bozos and weirdos zooming in on your phone to record you for content, man. If anything, they could've just told him the name of the song.
Did I see shazam apps???

Shazam cannot find the song 🤣🤣🤣🍌🍌🍌
😂 Amo shazam.... De las mejores app del mundo
Yo hago eso también 😂😂😂😅

Que tierno:(
"Hmmm, Human Music....I like it!"
The original artist did not give you permission to upload this 😢
❤❤❤❤❤
Почему бы не позвать этого чувака и не поделиться своей шикарной музыкой
You should hide the drug paraphernalia better 😉
That's fuking mental to see
Shazam deez nuts
Tell him what?
Dude you have to tell him
Its me 😂😂
i change the pitch and speed of the song so that shazam can't find my bangers, when i play outside my G class windows  down, it has worked like 6 times already(seen people trying to shazam and laughing to myself knowing they wont find shet)
так мило🔥
God I hate it when Shazam doesn’t pick up a song 😒💯🤣
So did the song get release?
I agree with him, I dig this sick beat too

That is definitely a track I would have Shazamed. Hope you publish it and we get a song name soon.

I don't get it..
Chocan esos. En lugar de ser sociables natural jajaja usan la app😂 y su desarrollo perdonal se EXIGE ya pues.
lol you gotta tell him
So are you going to tell us the song name of this absolute banger or what
You could have told him instead of laughing at him?
Well let us all not shazam this bangar and give us the song name, maybe?
You need to send him that unreleased track for him to enjoy it now.
The name of the music?
I do this all the time. how long till music titles go holographic please?
Who’s gonna tell me?
Music for bald guys
I discovered Nors Kode thanks to this video, I fell in love!
Pleaaaseee don't do that 😢 Tell him and give him a sample or something. Bro is out there waiting for that banger. 😭
Song’s name???
I know it would be hard, kinda awkward to engage the conversation (like for real, imagine you guys who post comment about inviting him) but it would really be wholesome lol,  but you cant expect total strangers to call themselves out like that lol
The guy watching the video 👁️👄👁️
nice beat bro when release of the song?:D
The weed paraphernalia lmao
Gotta be a top tier feeling 😭😭 song not even done and he tryna figure out the name lol
at least it probably means he likes it
Bro is using the Sony vaio P

God this is best compliment EVER!! An organic listen that leads to a search for the artist and song?!! 🤯
The biggest compliment
I have no idea what is happening

What song/artist is this?
Did he try to find the title of the song using Shazam?😂
Он шазамит, кто не понял

Jdkdksks ese en seria yoo dkdkkdkdk
Using Shasam to identify the song
Who else came to the comment section to get what is going on 😅😅
Tell him what?
This is so wholesome I could die
Нельзя так тролить людей 😂
It’s a Very nice feeling when you see people doing that.
Years before shazam, you have to sing infront of the cassette shop owner to describe a song 😆
😂 “Why can’t it find it?  Dumb app!!” 😂😅
Que mal la burla mijo invite pues 🙄🙄😐
Track name pls 😍
Really is there any link to the music though

Вы должны были его позвать
Well you made a hit

This guy may like it, but don’t be an asshole and blast your music out on the street to people who never asked for it.

Cruel cruel cruel intentions…

Il ne risque pas de trouvé 😂😂😂
bro so desperate for the music name
I don't get it
Shazam ❤
Shazam
😂 good song but can't copy the song
Should have told him it's your track
Interesting how people are patronising this guy, being ageist really,  when he is probably an OG raver from back in the day who partied into the morning at the very first annual rave.
I need to know the name of the song too 😂❤
What's this song anyway?
Shazam ?? 😁😅
me: watching this video and trying to find this music by shazam as well 🗿
Yeah even us old humans like new shit...funny we'd be discounted, when we'd be the most likely to actually pay you for your music...
You should take him for a joint&chill 😂
Sounds like a android ringtone to me or a clock alarm lmao.
thats me
Ohhh poor guy 😂❤
No results
Не понял
Moi je veux bien la musique aussi ! 😊
Best compliment you can get :)
I'd be honored
This is so me 😅🤭

The fact that he has his phone tilted facing your window shows that this is set up....
I hope you talked to the guy and let him know. as a sound person, this would kill me if i couldnt find a tune i heard, you only bust out this app for the best :)

Cool video, but i cant ignore the anti bird architecture, ik the people who made the video cant do anything about it, it just sucks to see, so many animals including birds can hurt themselves on those prongs, ive seen what happens to a cat when they are just minding their own buisness being curious, then one slip happens and its either vet bills and surgeries for years or 🙀☠️
For those who don't understand, he's using Shazam or some app to find what music this guy was playing, but since he was making it he's not gonna find it 😅
What’s going on?

For the people that don’t understand basic the guy made some beats and there’s an app but I don’t know what’s it called so the old man heard the beats but didn’t know what song it was cause he thought it was a song so he searched on the app😂
It's co cute actually

Who’s Shazam-ing this video
I don’t get it
What exactly is happening? He noticed the tune and used Shazam to listen to it and identify it?
Música ?
Man I LOVE this sound! Melodic/Deep House Vibes!❤
Good luck shazam
Shazam it 😂
He is using Shazam, an app that identifies music if anyone was wondering.
Bro if someone is trying to shazam your song, it means they like it, should at least have told him
Shazam
What is he doing?
my dumbass thinks that guy's playing pokemon go
I would have given that man my artist name and exchanged numbers with him. I would give him the first copy of the song. 😊 i would have also called out to the guy to tell him that he made my entire year and he is awesome 😊. I mean, not knowing if people are going to like your song is a big deal. Even one person happy with my song, I would feel so giddy with joy. 😅❤
Hell yes 🔥👏 Good taste in music!
Shazam!🎉
es una aplicación para conocer el nivel de decibelios , contaminación acústica
I can only focus on how much this guy hates birds.
Comon bro we do this all the time 😠
Noice!
I hate it when that happens. You Shazam a song you like and it doesn’t work. That’s worst.
Gib ihm die Musik 😂
I do the same thing, guilty.
😂😂😂
Anyone explain what is happening in this video?
"Mm, I wonder what music is that." * Opens Shazam in The Beatles' studio while recording Let it be *
Poor dad and son waiting for the ai to work 😂

🫣
You kick ass.
Bro Don’t laugh, it’s feeling not a Joke. When I see someone who has interest on what I do I would definitely invite and shear with them❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Moby?
Shazamm xd
He was 100% raving in his youth
Aww we this was wholesome man lol he loved your music
I do that too bro ❤
It looks as if the man wants to know what he hears in order to present it in the music lessons he teaches as the collapse of civilization.
The first man to shazam an unreleased song..   Lowkey he gonna hear that song again and still shazam/ask for the name 😂
Nah i bet he was so upset 😭
Its funny, doesn't work for me either. What's the name of the song?
That’s totally my dad Shazamming a badass sound that he knows he’ll never hear again if he doesn’t.
What ia the name of the song?
That’s a huge compliment
that me all the time when I ear good music 👏🏽🔊🎶🎧⚘
HAAAAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA
It would be crazy if shazam found it :)

Cuando me enamoro de un tema hago lo mismo 😁😁
When you know you've finally written a hit...
Verstehe ich nicht
Is that shazam
Just shout him out I didn't publish it yet
Votre 1er fan vous devriez lui fait une surprise 😂
Instead of secretly recording him and laughing at him to post on the internet. why not just talk to him? You could have a fan instead of making fun of him. What’s wrong with people?

I do this all time 😂
La risatina sembra però una presa in giro piu che fatta x contentezza
U can hardly call this music
I guess you know you’re winning
For those who don't understand the context, the guys are composing or mixing a song, and a person in the street likes so much the song, so he is shazamimg the song. I didn't understand the context at the beginning because the shazam I couldn't see the shazam logo because the video zoom quality.
Noice
I dont get it
Yo
Big compliment there
I didn't get the joke. Explain please
How can I have the pleasure to enjoy this beatiful music? Cheers!

Nice compliment that’s great
Shazam 😂😂😂
Das ist doch schön. Da mochte jemand die musik. Geh him und zeig ihm das
Hey be proud
Great music

Pretty much the same reason why I have a car: To watch people jam in the streets ! (It's loud)
Maybe you? Lol
Well… tell him the song name!😂😂
Who is gonna tell him what???
I dont understand this video
just invite him dude...
This is so adorable
Lol how cute.
This is the biggest compliment
Dude, I agree. You should have invited him up and sent him some links for your jams!
I don't get it.
When you try to get that song and google is still listening 😂😂😂 over and over listening
I dont care if the video its fake, name song???
Would be me 😂
Aww man I'd love to be here
Shazam is one of my favourite apps. Legendary.
Why make fun of him? The dudes jamming out to you.....
It's kinda a compliment, he likes your music and wants to hear more. So wholesome
Maybe invite the guy and appreciate him better than making fun of him ?
That’s adorable!
I’m always Shazaming. Best invention ever !
I’d take that as a compliment!
What a compliment
I do hope they let him know. He'd be your first super fan then 😊❤
Go tellll him😢❤😂
Royalty free microsoft powerpoint ahh music
what is happen?
Shazam!
I don’t get it 🤷🏼‍♂️
I like it too. So at least 2 fans meow.
the long rolling papers still on the table
I’m 51 and kids today are doing double takes when I drive through the neighborhood playing my 90’s house music. House music is my Oldies😂
Who knows the song lol ?
What's happening here?
I don’t understand…….is he looking for a signal?
is he shazaming it?
Totally not staged!
Who else had to come to the comments just to know what this is about? But I wouldn't be surprised if I was the only 1 🎉
Staged
If it weren't for the comments, I wouldn't even know what was going on. Im guessing he's recording the music with his phone?
😂😂😂😂 Everyone in this world since Shazam and sound hound 😂😂😂😂😂 but you can't find my MUSIC LMAO ❤❤❤❤ I FEEL IT THO Все в мире, начиная с Shazam и sound hound ShazamとSound houndの後の世界中のすべての人 الجميع في العالم بعد Shazam و Sound Hound   Shazam 和 Sound 猎犬之后的世界上每个人😂😂😂  Iedereen in de wereld na Shazam en Sound Hound  Tout le monde dans le monde après Shazam et Sound hound   Jeder auf der Welt nach Shazam und Sound Hound   هر در جهان پس از Shazam و صدا سگ شکاری   Shazam ᠪᠣᠯᠣᠨ Soundd ᠶᠢᠨ ᠳᠠᠷᠠᠭᠠᠬᠢ ᠳᠡᠯᠡᠬᠡᠢ ᠳᠡᠭᠡᠷᠡᠬᠢ ᠬᠥᠮᠥᠨ ᠪᠣᠯᠭᠠᠨ ᠃   Wonke umuntu emhlabeni ngemva Shazam futhi Sound hound   O tagata uma i le lalolagi ina ua mavae Shazam ma Sound hound   😂😂😂😂😂😂
My guy just wants to vibe.
Shazam ❤❤❤❤
Invite him for a lil puff puff give, there’s  bowls and papers on the balcony.
Probably left a bad review after it didnt find the song😂
I didn't get it!! :(
What am I seeing?
How could this possibly be real.
Is he shazaming their music?
yo id invite him over for a coffee and snack and more tracks
What is going on I don't get it ToT
Lol, its funny how we suddenly gain more strength when by ourselves 😂
Ive been him too much
Aww that’s nice for the producer I hope u said hi
We cry. Those type of men cry when we don’t find those melody’s. So thanks. For at least relieving me when it comes to sounds.
Oh he’s trying to find the song on his phone?
What am I missing I don’t get it
I thought they were playing the ringtone of his phone and pranking him😂
Im sorry, whats going on?
"Whats thisssssssssss?"
Fake
Shazam
Cuenta la leyenda que aún sigue parado ahí afuera tratando de que Shazam reconozca el audio
Seriously, what the song called?
Uhh probably you! Clearly a future fan lol
I’m lost 😒
Bounce him the stems 😂
I don’t get what’s happening.
What's he doing?
Sound connects us 💜
Yeah I do this all the time in the mall. Different shops with different genres and always seem to have that track you never heard before 😅
Imagine he was rich n you didn't talk to him
People underestimate Shazam’s sound detection capabilities, I went to a bazaar with a bunch of loudspeakers playing some really nice tunes, I just hit auto shazam and put the phone in my pocket, by evening when we had to go back home for a 6 hour ride back I already had 2 hours worth of new songs for the trip 😂
Is the track released? What's the name if so?
He really like the music  😢😊
I don’t  Get it can some explain?
Shazam ?
Call him up gave him a RS11 🎉
you should've invited him and had a coffee with the man
Shazam😂
Beautiful
Song name❤❤?
I don't get what's going on 😢 someone please share.
Can some explain what's going on !
What a feel good moment. I sure hope you acknowledged him for listening.
Aw man! that is cute tho, the bro liked the song :)
Er sucht den Song über Shazam 🙄 was soll er wohl sonst machen?!
Laughing at the one who loves you 😢
Took me some time to realize whats going on lol thats cute
imo that beat is fire
I finally get it that he is using shazam to know what music
This is so wholesome ❤
Shazammmnmmnmn
Shazam not working lol
Thats so cute!
He is using Shazam
😂
This man is getting the sauce straight from the factory and doesn’t even know it
There’s nothing you can have someone do more to compliment your music than to stand next to your window and Shazam that stuff while your blasting it.
He got the exclusive drop
I’m not sure what’s going on I can’t read what’s on the phone
Yo that’s a sick beat man good job
Oh she’s got bruises but makeup isn’t only for faces lol
oh that is awesome!! that feeling you get when someone likes your work is unmatched 💪🏼💯
You?
Was he trying to shazam the music?
Verizon Ah beat
Nors kode has a new follower in spotify (me). Loved it.
I dont get it
What is he doing?
😂😂😂
invite the man in and introduce him to the process!!! he clearly likes what he hears
That guy's my spirit animal lmaoo
Who among you thought somebody is sitting on his lap? 😅
but shazam finds a song similar to yours with the same chords and melody 😬
I don‘t get it. What‘s happening?
thats how you know your track is fire
Đó là sự thành công của nghệ sĩ 🙂‍↔️
I love that he’s like “shit this good” enough to pull out Shazam. It’s like the ultimate compliment.
Makes me remember when i was doing lyft playing music from a band called inner wave, one day one of my rider ( a chill, kinda old guy) he was fascinated by the band tht he asked me for the name of the band nd song he told me that he felt that they sounded like another band he remembered thats why he liked the music i was listening to.
Instead of recording him to post for internet points you could haven invited him up and made an even better post.
My guy is trying to Shazam it omg the pain 😫
now whats the song name?
Them cheeky long raw rizlas on the balcony table oi oi 😉
I would shazam it too😍
I'm guessing he's listening to this bands song? What is going on in not in the know on this one
The music has a nice vibe, chill, relaxing but upbeat and makes you feel good.
Invite that guy up, major fan.
That’s it cut it sell it clearly it’s a hit
Idk what the fuck is going on here but apparently everyone else does
Er mag eure Musik und euch fällt nichts besseres ein als über ihn zu lachen und ihn online vorzuführen. Armselig
I don't understand what the man is doing
what happend?
I admit i put my shazam on shortcut key😂
That’s my dad 😂
Imagine if it showed up and said "upstairs song being produced right now" and then he put his earbuds in and walked off, who would be laughing then?
best music is unreleased
You gotta think 20-25 years ago they went to all the electronic music Festivals but even when old the Love for electronic music never fades...Just Like my brother too he May turn 50 soon but the memory of past days is still alive dancing away to music.
That's when you know your shit is good!
I dont get it 😮
Bruh that’s lit 🔥 your studios geography definitely is putting you on not to mention this 🔥 azz beat !!! Look my brother up Djforfunerals and Cicadahead same person solo and w band
This is breathtaking!
009 sound system

I have no idea what is on that mans phone? 😅
that's clearly his father, don't y'all see the resemblance

What’s happening?
Shazam is a dead app. Google did a better job identifying miles davis in one second when Shazam failed four times in a row to identify the song.
this has to be in california
Darude sandstrom
Checking the latency and sample rate though 😂
Man this shyt garbauhhhhgeeee you did bro a favor by not inviting him up 😂
Shazam
what's the tune playing in there?
He trying to Shazam it ha
explain plz
Plot twist : He's so tired of the same music that have been bothering him all this time 😂
Damn that's a fucking good complimennt
What a compliment. That's awesome.
Oh i get it... He's Shazaming what they're playing up loud inside and he can hear it from the outside. I thought those railings were glass windows...
Unreleased 🎶
That must have been such a cool feeling knowing that a stranger is actively looking for "who tf made this banger?" I would have told him to come join the sesh ❤❤ probably a chill mf dude
I’m totally confused can somebody please explain
bro do ppl in the building see what u  seeing on the phone? im ebrassed now
Shazam s’est comme google , ton ami 🤣
Who is going to tell “who”, what?  A video of a guy looking at his phone and another one sitting in a room laughing.  So?
I dont get it?
You
Bro definitely has glowsticks in that rucksack...
Shazam 🎉
I'm confused
what l going on here ??
Me everywhere
Huh????
Musics meant to be shared man
Who’s going to tell him? You guys if you had the decency 😂
Content I live for
He was trying shazam? Or something else?
Me every single yime a hear a track ❤😂
You are assuming we aren't in hell already....
Who is not in possesion of this little nice Akai MPK ?
probably fake for publicity, people never question!
They let the guy just walk away frustrated. 😢
Out of all the times to have a CD of your music this would be the perfect time
your first fan
Tell him what? That he did good at his part in the video, doing exactly what he was told to do for the camera. (Yes its staged).   Or tell him that that song/music absolutely fucking sucks, and should absolutely be deleated. I can never unhear something, but if I could, I would choose this to be the thing I could unhear. That's awful on every single level...
Darude Sandstorm.....Thank me later!!
Vibing comes in all ages love this Vid
Greatest compliment a producer can get :)
Nice one.😊
Shazam😂
Literally got a fan right below you and you make fun of him for what?
Красавчик
tell him what?
Den track hät ich aber auch gleich gesucht ☺️
Bro making loading screen soundtracks
norwegian code?
I dont understand
Que bello, invitenlo por un cafecito 😊
So this is how the albums are leaked😂
Elderly man at that.
Name of the music?
Sounds like a knock off U2.
not everyone saying to bring a stRANGER inside??? a very funny and kind gesture but the man is still a stranger lol
Glad I'm not the only one who still uses Shazam 🥹
You should 🤷🏻‍♂️
What’s the song tho
I’d take that as a huge compliment if it were me
Love!
Oh, he was recording the music😂😂😂... I had no idea what was going on until I went to the comment section.....I thought he was trying to get on their wifi😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not sure you should be making fun of him, he appreciated the music.
That's Shazam??
Nice vídeo! Music name? Plis!
Digga dann klärt man ihn auf das er es nicht finden kann wenn es noch nicht wirklich existiert und läd ihn vlt auf ne molle und musik  mit ein
Yooo the remote control app is crazy too when you go to places with Tvs...i didnt tell yall that tho lol
Umiltà 0%
!! The guy below scanning the music via Shazaam app on his phone
that's sooo wholesome
😂😂 that’s a compliment
I'm so confused
Shazam 😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥
That’s some corpo music there ? How are people even listening to this lol
Das bin so ich ey 😂
As a Indian this took a seconds to understand
Lol, I love this. Always wanted this to happen one way or the other
Let’s embarrass someone who likes my work! 😀
Oh! I hate when Shazam cant find it😂
I would have been Shazamming too 😂
Would be so much better to share with him instead of turning him into a joke*
I love it!
Would def invite home over
Awww that's so sweet❤
For anyone wondering, the guy on the street is using an app to help him get the name of the song playing… the song playing is being played by the artist himself working on the song at his computer.  Took me a second to realize what was happening
Can anyone tell me if this song exists?
Help him out.
I don’t get it ?.. I kinda want to though lol 😂 both seem happy
You ass you should have just invited him, instead of sitting taping
😂😂😂
Is he having the phone figure out the song that's playing or is he playing the song outside the creator's place?
I hope you told him
You should probably explain what's even happening.
Be proud someone is doing this 😂
Aw man that's kinda mean. At least give the guy a heads up.
Dont get it
My mom literally everywhere we go
Bro Shazamming the music 😂
Shazam ❤
Yeah I’m not sure what’s going on, I don’t get it. It’s a guy holding his phone out on a blue screen and then a guy playing music, what about it?
Whos gonna tell him? You should duh
MATT?
I dont get it...what happened?
through my music app, i saw that some people in france tried shazaming my music! it’s the best compliment a musician can get
Nobody’s gonna mention the RAW rolling papers and the lighter 🤷🏽‍♂️
What's the name of soundtrack that's being played? Is it on YouTube?
Shazam veio de guerra
Cool feeling seeing that live lol
Plz tell me the name of the song.😢
Wtf is going on here
New fan unlocked
Es su padre
Who’s going to tell him what? Video makes no sense
Tell him what?
ID?
Bro was walking , heard that and started to feel like the main character and had to pause real quick to add it to the soundtrack of his life
This is Great
SHAZAM!!!! yeah i agree with others here that you should have invited him because your music is good.... I even think so tooooooo
Moby lookin old.
Is he trying to find the music on his phone?
It took me a minute to understand what I just watched.  I only realized when I seen the #shazam tag in the video. Watched it 3 times to understand.  I also haven’t ever used Shazam, so I had no clue what the guy was doing on his phone.  Now I understand.  #Shazam.
do people actually think this is good. Swear I’ve heard the same song when I was watching training videos as a customer service employee 😂
I've read hundreds of comments and still don't get what's going on here?
I dont understand whats even going on
the old one measures dB, why complain?!
I'm Lost.
He enjoys the music and u laugh at him…
❤❤❤❤❤
Shazaming an unreleased song is brazy😭💀😹
What's happening? I don't understand 😮
Is the guy shazaming the music?
I don't get it. What was the guy doing?
Shazam hahaha sorry we didnt found the song try again omg hahahaha 😂😂😂
I hope you let him know!!! ❤ That's high praise
Man was into it and you tried to be a dick about it.
That Moby?
Fake. The guy is in on it
I can really see what's going on but from the looks of it, i assume he's trying to shazam?
Who's the producer?
That is the neighbor, recording how loud the music is.......
Tell him
dude is vibin your music
So wholesome
Tell him what??
What, is he Shazaming ?
Como le decimos que es una pista en desarrollo que aún no sale al mercado!
I mean, I get it lol, I *love* this track!
Do not understand
That’s right ! Who is going to tell him about streaming platforms . If you want to promote your music you need to reach out beyond just your balcony and the street corner
Smart ad
I'd be giggling like a little girl 😂
That ish aint even funny. Do you no how annoying it is when you hear music and you really want to hear it again or see how the song changes etc and the shazam is not shazaming 😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣 i feel his pain 😇
Is he trying to Shazam?
Why make fun of him? Invite him in and show him around! He’s a fan!
Using Shazam to see who you are. That's a compliment
I’m like this guy have shazamed your song 😂 I’m on fire - Nors Kode, good vibes btw ❤
Cute ❤
When your friend got the auxiliary cord, plays a banger but don't wana put you on. 😒
Kann jemand erklärbär machen?
OMG that's so funny. 😂🤣🤣🤣
Me asf
that’s me drunk on a saturday lol
I dont get it
Lmfao I legitimately opened up Shazam as soon as the video started because I wanted the name of this tune ! Invite that man upstairs ! And tell me when this absolute BANGER drops !
Ayo I’m digging it tooooo
Awww such a sweet and pure compliment ❤ ✌🏽  how fkn endearing is that!!
What is the joke ? I don't understand (i really don't understand don't insult me i'm just asking)
Awesome no context video , no clue what's going on.
Hahahah
Tell me if "i" understand ☠️
I thought he was using the db meter to call the cops😂
Sounds like Ben Böhmer ❤️
Once my earphones connected with my collegues phobe and he was watching hentai
Who is going to tell him what?
Awwwwwwwwwww 🫶✨
I hope (if this is even real… these days it’s questionable) the video just isn’t long enough to show them doing the right thing and instead of just using him for content they let him know and cultivated a new fan.
Airdrop it
Awww he loves it
W situation
100% have dropped my own dubplates and had people say to me “I couldn’t Shazam this, what track is this??” 🙂 such an awesome complement
Why you making music that sounds like a news station interval 😂
What a npc to shazam that menu musics hahahaha
Old skulo
The fact people think this video is real are so dumb lmaoo. They literally just got some dude to do that for them for clout
For those who wonder what he is doing, he just looking for the song name on his phone with shazam app from where you can find the name of song in seconds.
Mea culpa I Do that to 🤗🫣😆👍
That just shows that no matter what music you make, there will be someone who likes it! Keep going!
Shazam
Use shazm
This song is fire I would’ve been standing there doing the same thing
For real tho can we get a download link? ❤❤❤
What is even happening...oh. horse shit.
bro should be recording the song
best thing that has ever happened during a session
😂 what music
Hay samsung what song is this hahahah
Why are u filming this man? He just likes your music. I woud invite him to a coffee and send him this song..
Aww, a silent compliment.
Idk what's going on
People keep saying invite him in like killers and rapist don’t exist
If anyone is wondering what this banger is… it’s Darude: Sandstorm.
No accounting for bad taste
what is this song?
what is the song and when will it be realsed? such a great beat
Hehe I would have been shazaming it also
now i’m imagining this is what happens every time Shazam can’t find a song😂
sí soy...
Ha ha big 💩
Zo zie je maar weer SHAZAM is super handig je kunt hem aanzetten en hij zoekt het bijbehorende nummer😊😅😂
Yall are douches. He likes it
Tell him what ??
That IS a sick beat!! Dude has taste!!😂 But y'all GOTTA tell him!! 😂😂😂
He’s like “This is 100% gonna be the next song for my accounting software tutorial”
That’s a thumbs up for you don’t torment the poor guy who is a fan of your music… trying to shazam it 10x with no results
Lost opportunity tbh. Hope he sees this.
Awww that's adorable
Tell him what???
Tell him what?
PLot twist. AI just made him a copy of his own. muwhahaha
When you're using Content ID to identify music without Content ID.
Fake. No one could like that music.
You! You go tell him!
I know he’s PISSED 😭😭
Laughing at him? 😢
I don't get it? Tell him what?
Id release early just for him 😂😂😂
Cute 😂
ME AFFF
darude sandstorm
Eu quisesse saber o nome da música kakakaka😢
😂😂😂
This guys really enjoys his music. They should definitely tell him!

😂
Must b some good beats then for the ol fulla
Don’t have to Shazam buddy, just search on google “backing track for a healthcare or retirement home ad” and you’ll find it😂
Hey daddy, want to interview the artist 🎉
Chayane!!! a no Shazam!
Bro should have got a Google pixel
Dudes already found the correct artist he just need look up
I shazam all the time!  I had a guy in a store say to me, "We've never had someone take pictures of our ceiling." LOLOLOL
It looks like my dad 💀
Help the dude out 😢....
Shazam !
Instead of telling him they decided to make fun of him, what a great guys they're.
lol
Thats gotta be an amazing feeling. You know you’re doing music right when this happens
Who’s going to tell him? You.  You must
Wats going on ?
😂😂😂
He is a Producer , makes now Millions with a Snippet from a Sound taken from the Street
Tell him what? I dont get it
Should have called him up  I think that man is a cancer patient I've seen him around somewhere!!!!
Means?
I just bought the whole album just now. Its simply superb. I'm loving the vibe its giving off.
I would’ve been like “ yo bro we still working on it wanna help “
Fake. Nobody wants to shazam this random news intro music.
I would’ve started throwing it back idc
This is how you know someone has good vibes. 😂
Anyone who liked this should look up "get it by your hands" the anime it came from was kinda trash, but the house music in the show and the references to it are pretty good. If your into that.
That’s the best praise you’ll get.
what a compliment. i would shed a tear and invite him up.
Invite him up there bro
Shazam ist aber super 😂
Who noticed the RAW paper on the balcony 😂😂
Absolutely beautiful!
He is trying Shazam the song, which Ives him the artist and the name of the song
Highest compliment
Start playing PHub sounds and watch how fast he throws his phone
Not me tryna Shazam the song as well 😂
I think he's recording, good music🔥😎
I dont get it
.
So relatable,  the best short I have ever seen on YouTube...😂
best resonance you can get
whats going on? i dont get it
people can see you too much
Damn this is a sick song, do you have a name for it yet?
Good luck to him, my shazam couldn't find the song haha
This is me everywhere - I was once in a one star restaurant, I was trying to Shazam a song very elegantly, when the Chef saw me I couldn't find it, since the volume was too low, he brought me a piece of paper with the title of the song! 😍
What's the song called?
I have kind of the same problem now... it's stuck in a loop for the maybe 20th time
Owsome, ♡♡
❤❤❤❤
Wow that's awesome
Dude youre missing out on word of mouth right now.
For.....
Could be me!
That's just his dad
I mean the beat goes hard
Good ad.
You should never laugh at your fans!!!!🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ Especially whoever is cackling!!!🐔🐔
The “raw” rolling papers on your balcony table 👀enjoying a little herb while jamming😂
What's going on here?
Get that man a drink!
Thats an instant compliment 😊
Am I a moron...... someone please explain what is going on to  me?
That’s cool 😎
No one😂😅. I’m glad he likes your music.
this must be the coolest feeling ever
Man of culture and good taste. Invite him for a preview
What’s funny? You should’ve been proud. ❤what happened after this though? 😁
Cool video and all but who else saw a woman as if she was sitting on his lap? I can’t be the only one who saw it at first glance 😂
That’s not Shazam, thats a decibel device to report him to the police 😉
?
What a complement ❤
I’m really annoyed u just laughed at him in this video, pretty rude if u ask me, doesn’t match the child music at all
Me Fr
shazam?)
I don't understand
Fake
😂
That has got to be a set up
Did anyone tell him?
يبحث عن بيكيمون 😂
لص الاغاني 😂
omg🥺
Oh I am OBSESSED with this lol.
If you see someone trying to get music that you made now that’s a big win 👍
I don’t get it
can someone tell me me what is happening? I don't get it.
i should be there
People think this is real and this ain’t just their manager or dad out there 😅😅
tell him what, exactly?
Funny, lol but i dont blame him for being confuzzled 😂
Shasam lol
That’s so sweet ❤
I hope they told that man! Gave him any and all of their socials and showed him HOW to find them and that music 😭
Is my man playing Pokémon go
This would make a fire background track for a workplace safety training course
I mean. You could have. You could have told him.
It took me a second cause I've NEVER used Shazam in my life 😂
I want to know if Shazam have him a result. 😊
WHAT IS IT CALLED THO
Tell me first
Damn I feel bad fr. You should've told him!!
I just shazamed it too though.
Biggest compliment you could get. Let him know your info and let it spread to more people!
What the track?
For real tho, lemmi get that track 👀
Sack your PR guy, laughing at would be fans.
Bro he was literally giving you props without knowing it😢❤
what was that guy doing? 🤷‍♀️
It's Shazam
I don't even know wtf is going on here tbh
I find it kind of annoying. He clearly sees you standing there, he’s trying to sneak the song from you then take off, instead of giving you credit for mixing it 😒
Old men😂
Cmon he deserves an invite, he defo enjoyed your music :(
Maaan this is the best compliment you can ever get from a random stranger. You know you got something good there. We don’t know but I hope you told him the faxes 📠.
Dope
YESSSSSS SAME BIG DOG❤❤❤
Tell him what?
Poor man
It’s being cooked
Respect people who love whst you create dnt be a snob about it .. i would have told him to come up lets jam.. you sad people ..
Surely the best compliment you can get.
I would’ve been funny and just yelled out the name that I chose for this song, and then the artist of the person sitting there 😅😅😅
Aww I would have gave him my info so he could become a fan!! ☺️☺️
That’s the Best compliment a producer can get
When Snapchat use to do the one story for some random city around the world , they did Oslo once and posted this chill techno group and the song was incredible and I’ve never been able to find it since and it haunts me every day .
Did y’all end up telling him?
Ultimate compliment
Aww bless him! You don’t have to be in your teens to enjoy good music, our body ages but the soul lasts forever. ❤🎼🎶🎵🎹🎧
Why is this literally me 😂
Can anyone explain me
If he was enjoying he’d be hearing it, not recording it. Man stealing his BEATS. 🤷🏽‍♂️
TNH!
I like the setup, indoors and balconys
I bet as a producer trying to make it you would just laugh at this and think you made some awesome stuff, but I mean cmon you saw the top comment, you should’ve taken him inside lol
I have no idea what is going on here.
*finds the song*
You? Idfk
I like when travelling with friend when pulling into a drive thru to override their Bluetooth over FM and impersonate the drive-thru equipment.
At least that's all he's watching 😮
you know you made it to the top when someone random shazam your music
Good damn, my Shazam don’t working, pls up w
Scream at him saying  , " its Not done Yet!!! "
Got something similar one single time. Best compliment ever.
Tell him what?
You guys bust out original menu music
Fake
Wait what is he doing? Is he Shazaming the song or sum'?
Sounds like a ring tone that's getting extra elaborate just to get you to answer
Throw him a flash drive with the mp4 😂
Lol 😂the window 😂
Ableton gang pop out 👇🏾
i hate when this happens to me
What a compliment!
As a producer, there’s no better compliment ❤
Im Kurdish and I support Palestine. Free Palestine 🇵🇸
The funny part is that guy work for sony and looking for new seed. 😅
I agree wirh the others, you should have invited him!
Instant validation. 🎉
We old raver, thinking of 1990s.
What's going on here?
Thats a huge compliment. You should go say hi
Shazam 😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Watching this for 10 mins now while walking to a friend. Idk why, watching this makes me happy. Just some how fulfilling
sounds like ambient copyright-free forza horizons background music.
Track name brah?
No 1 Fan 😂😅
You’re gonna find it homie🤣
Nice joint papers 🤣
erm... what exactly is happening here?
Are those spikes to stop people climbing up? Wild
He's like 😏🤳🏻 I gotta Shazam this track for my workout. 😁😂

Why would anyone give a shit about such fucking horrible music?
Plot twist.. mf is checking decibels to see what he’s about to tell the cops.
Cute

Its a compliment
Someone please explain, I dont get it
Wholesome
Aw that’s so cute 😭 my heart would explode

So cuteeeee
I couldn't Shazam it either
Nah the past few shorts I have just scrolled hVe been the best in a WHILE, I think todays gonna be a good day 😊
Me at every show 😅😅😅
Whats the context?
Police in America do nothing but look for ways to make money 👀

Plot twist: he heard a sample and is sending the recording to his copyright attorney 😂
Pray that they gave him a lil love:.)
May be a weebit too stoned to know wtf is going on here 😂
He love you😅😂
Searching for sauce at sauce factory
Yall know this is fake for publicity, right?
That's cool af.
🤨
Its the guys music he likes. Age doesn't come into it.  If you like the sound of the music, it will stop you dead in your tracks .....simples
😂😂😂😂
What a nice compliment
Don’t understand this man outside on his phone and music playing in hippys apartment?
Bruh I would literally invite him over for a joint and a beer that guy was pretty interested for your creation
I miss those EDM techno days
Music reminds me of something you’d hear in the mid to late 2000s
Damn that’s an undeniably best feeling man. I feel the goosebumps here
Not sure whats happening in this vodeo.
When you can’t wait to music to coming out, and check it earlier for be sure 😂
That's why the police should always work with partners. Safety in numbers.
Ya'll should've invited him up!! Shoot I'd record his reaction and mix it in.
Priceless reaction!❤
We can just copy tunes out the air now🎉
He like that music but can’t find it on the app he’s uses lols maybe brake it to him it a live vibes 😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊
Must be the best feeling
No better sign you’re cooking than that
Laughing at a potential fan is CRAAAAAZY, invite the guy, have fun

Wow this guy really likes elevator music
JUST TELL HIM THE NAME FFS

a fan
Whats he doing shazaming it?
I don’t get it
Tell him what
The maker
Kevin macleod ahh music
What is this music please, i am pissed like this old man !
Is he Shazam ing your song ?
These ppl in the apartment hijacked the man's blue tooth, i know bc this happened to me & then a full blown identity theft. To many ppl walk around with their blue tooth on & criminals can get right into it, it's easier than most ppl think!!.  Edit; not saying these guy's are criminals they're obviously just pranking some ppl, but this is one way criminals get into our phone's/device's.
Ocb longpapes am start der typ haha
Progressive melodic trance ❤🎶 I Could sit for hours just listening to this kind of music and just let my mind drift away 😄👏
For those of you wondering, this is Sandstorm by Darude
isn't that the biggest compliment to a new song?
"Source?" *The source upstairs*
Invite him over!  :O
What you mean whos gonna tell him? Boy YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM??
Why make fun of the guy when you could just say hello?
should've given him your @... that's a lifetime listener
SHAZAM THAT SHIT!!! I DO IT ALL THE TIME
*Bro is invited to the pizza party* 🍕 🥳
What are the people in production getting paid would be my next questions. Cutter, Sewer, Finisher?
I like the beats. what's the song called?
Most confusing video on YouTube. Zero context
Where can i find this song ?
Typical vaper
Yall really not even gonna holler at a fan? Lol
Why does that AH just laugh? Offer him a coffee, if you see that. Jesus, how blunt can one get? Yuck! No matter who he thinks he is, he is an AH for this video.
Is that Shazam? It work he is on the bleeding edge of music innovation right here
I love trance music.
I heard he's still looking for the song name to this day.
Shazam💀
I don’t get it
One of my favorite djs Sven Vath is like this he never releases the stuff he plays live, so tragic but makes seeing him live the best
Thats my teacher😂😂😂(actually that person)
Bless his heart🫶🏼
Sounds like dr office hold music
Number one fan from the beginning
No one wants to Shazam your garbage music bud
Mans is trying to Shazam the future
Awhh he seems sweet, you should've shouted down and told him that an original and he can  come up to the studio, I would've
so cute
:D :D :D
So what’s he doing
It's on production bro! Plz tell him!!!
should’ve invited him up he’d be a fan for life and told all his friends
Omggggg this ACTUALLY warms my heart did you guys go tell him!?
FIRST FAN!😂
apparently not these savages 😂😂😂
You'll never know,maybe this guy was a rich producer and you guys lost your chance...
That man is me😂❤
Man's got the Shazam app tryin to find this song.
na i hope they told him after
“Bro I f*ckin need that tune”
You should’ve hooked him up with the Track. Bro would’ve loved that. 🥹
should have told him it wasnt out yet atleast 8====D heads
would someone kindly educate me as to what is happening here? 🤔
The look on his face is priceless 😂😂☠️
What's happening in this video? I dont have the best eyesight so can't see whats on the guys phone.
Plot twist he is a producer that  just recorded and set up copyright with distribution label and has the masters ..it will be in a movie in one week
🤷🏻‍♂️
I know I'm out of the loop because I had to read a bunch of comments to begin to understand what is happening. I still don't fully. 😅 Shazam?
Jajajaja que capitulo es
Seen rizla and extract pot on the windowsill 😎🔥🔥🥳🥳⁴²⁰
The music sounds like the beginning to a work training video.
ALMOST F YOU BRO!!!!! IVE BEEN IN THIS PREDICAMENT BEFORE omg
pov: he is a music producer, he wants to plagiarize the music but has to confirm its not on other platforms yet
well i see it as a compliment 😂
That’s pretty Dope🫡‼️
The man needs that ID
How would you even know what he's doing on his phone for real? He could be looking up porn
I can't tell what he's doing on his phone???
I don’t get it 😐
For some reason that looks like such a chill and comfortable place to live. It's like a movie spot or something
I dont get it
This is a smart ad
You should have just copied it to a USB and handed it to him and been like that's the only copy available at this moment. enjoy it
Come on man. That's one of the coldest things you can do 😩
He probably think its sound familiar that the beat might be from the 80s movie soundtrack "The Neverending Story" 📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢
Shazam cant find it 😂
He probably went throught the Rave scene while you were pissing in nappies......
He's measuring the level of sound so he can report you
This is so endearing lol 😊
Every producers dream 😂😂😂
Ey where can i get those tubes
"Hello" -Adele
😂😂😂og said I’m not leaving without this track even if I have to record it!!😂
YOU gotta tell him
Jeeez I want that track after its released 🤩🤩🤩🤩
❤
Nothing more relaxing than making edm music with the window open on a nice summer day
Tell him what exactly?
Wholesome
Would’ve given him some generic edm result if not none. It tries so hard to give results even when low confidence.
SHAZAM !!
For those that are confused, hes using the Shazam feature on his iPhone or whatever equivalent he has, to listen to the music and search for the name of the song.
he’s into that corporate commercial shit 😂
Coolest Short today😂🎉
he’s gonna be searching for the rest of his life
Love it!
Ive definitely shazamed music just to find out its maroon 5.
Now the guys going to go the rest of his life asking people if they know a song that "goes like this" while hes making mouth noises trying to describe it.
For reals, where can I find the song though?😅
Bro thought we wouldn’t see the za
Fake video
Nice advertising
Lmao! Shoulda yelled out, it’s not done yet!
What happened?
He’s authenticating the place make sure if nothing pops up it’s real
i wasnt getting what was going on, its been some years since last time i used shazam 😂
Is that David Beckham?
Music By ---》 Ben Böhmer -  Cappadocia
This is actually very nice.
Sorry but whats the old guy doing?
So what’s the song name
Now thats the balcony of a fellow pot smoker💚
Bro is trying to shazam _elevator music_  😂😂😂
That's gotta be an amazing feeling 😂
Im the bald man and i still dont know the song... :(

Pure gold masterpiece right there... hit wonder🎉🎉😅
I’m about that fellas age and I would be doing the same thing because I love this music!!!!
I know how that guy feels
Should of put it on a thumb drive for him real quick lol
He really likes the music your computer software created.
Your first complement without telling a word..you're lucky👌

He's shazaming it to report you to the music authorities 😂
That’s really cute  Guys got good taste
Oh, I get it! Shazzam app.

You should!
I didn't get it until I read a comment about shazam.. my heart absolutely melted. How precious and sweet. I do feel so bad for your neighbors though 😂
Burn a disc for the man I’m sure he’s just gonna listen to it instead of selling it
What a compliment!
So what’s the track ID??
I'd invite him in. pure love
You should have invited him in bro
Great job!
Hold on, I’m trying to find the song
You?
This and everyone in the comments makes me want to vomit
No but for real is there a release planned?
Mocking a potential fan, sure
Bro tryna Shazam the new cook up lmao dope
Thats great that someone is looking for your toon. . . a big plus that
Who's gonna tell him what?
I'm confused, please tell me what's going on.
True fan. Knows what he/ them likes
TRACK ID: FINAL MIX(V.5)
Bros catching a Pokémon 😮‍💨
I be the one walling around shazaming everything too trying to get my playlist right.
That is a major compliment to your music man. Sweet!
Were can i listen to full track that sounds like a monster beat 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im confused
He was diggin the vibes 😎
Hope Shazam find it 🤣🤣👍👌
1 LETTER EACH: USE THE TAP MODEL. (Truth, Apology, Praise)
Sauce
I dont get it
Say something loser
this is obviously staged. no one that age os using shazam, and no ones using shazam to figure out rocketleague background music
Whoever invented Shazam is the goat.
Ultimate producer flex
talk to him boy
tell me you invited him up!
Whats the context here?
man made a rookie mistake and didn't think to record it someway 😔
This song is lame af
Is he trying to Shazam the unreleased song which is in the making? NICE :D
That's awesome!
That’s an amazing feeling right there.
What he's listening to the same song?? I don't get it... Probably can't see it on a phone screen?
La verdad que el coche es una pasada de bonito
Should've invited him to the studio.
what's the song called? sounds dope af
No joke. Go down there, invite him up. You'll make a new friend. Be a nice human.
We need this track on a loop!!
So you're getting a thrill over someone else wasting time? Lame and I hope your music goes nowhere
What is that song. I loooove it ☺️🥰
nah dude if a mid aged bloke taking out his phone to find out your song he the real fan give this man his song and some headphones
this does sound good its real trance like 2005 2006 90's
Oh poor lad hope he was invited in.
Saaaaaaame though
That's me all the time
That's a fantastic track btw!
Wholesome
Name or link to released music?
You guys are being dicks.
What he doin with phone!?
He might be a music exec
He said.  Ohh where dey do dat at?
That be me
I don’t understand
Wholesome 🥺
I don't understand. What's going on here?
It's so cute. 😊
That's the reaction that you want 😅
What IS the song name thought?!?!?
Breh economies getting tight should've had a hat out for donations or charging concert fee's Side Hustle up!  🙃
That was YOUR JOB
Well you could tell him this link. That's incredible
Imagine if Shazam matched something:))
"Hmm, this is a tough one" - 'we're giving it one more try"
Omg I would cry😭😭😭😭
VALHALLA
tell him what, you assume too much
Thats how you know youre doing good stuff
Love Create Invent
i admit i made that more than one time
Pls tell me he saw this video and hit y’all up! 😂
I genuinely hope you guys introduced yourselves to him. I think you guys just gained a fan!
fattest compliment ever
Bit smug but good tune. Defo should have sorted the fella out some tuneige😂
I love that ❤
That’s probably happen to me , ngl 😂😂
Invite the dude, wtf
why does everbody know what the fk hes doing there?
Fake.
Dudes a fan should have hooked him up with an experience he could always pass on to others.
he probably wont believe they actually are the ones making it
Imagine if it found a match
Tell him what?
Thats awesome
😂😂😂😂 ayy you got a fan
Thst actually sounded crisp
songname for real tho? this is fire
Massive compliment
But genuinely, what is the name of the song playing? Sounds absolutely beautiful 😍
That is so cool.
That’s hilarious that he wanted to know what the sound was…
I’d be soooooo happy
Good to know your PC work with BT cause thats easy to get into.
The so could have been me! Hey Google music in clubs Asian supermarkets, Turkish bakeries and so much more!  It's beautiful finding new music! 🎶
Bro bout to go home and vibe out with his new banger he just found.
Instead of recording him why didn't you invite him up he probably would have made his day
If anyone wondering. He's using Bixby to find the music they're making. Unfortunately tho....it's not realsed
Shazam!? 🤷‍♂️
best compliment ever❤
Imaging he actually connects and accesses al your porn stache.
Which track is this? I want to listen.
Look how music connects us
Seriously though where can I find the SONG?
Man was looking for sauce and didn't realize he was in the pan!
Bro all i get is people calling the cops and eggs thrown at my window when i play my own music. I only use headphones now
that´s a great compliment
I met a friend over the smell of some bud 😂
Man is using Shazam app to find out the song name......
Anyone got the song name I need to add this to my shroom playlist
I would’ve handled that different
The word of mouth marketing woulda been free and easy if you invited him in
I hope you have tell?
Thats a compliment😅
Whats going on here? Can anyone tell me?
What guy with phone doing?
You should,  he Liles your stuff
Bro I catch people shazaming my playlist all the time 😂😂😂😂 I would be excited if they did this with my projects
*darude sandstorm appears on screen*
Thats so me ,on my bike listenning to the cars music with my shazam on😂😂😂
Meanwhile myass doing the same thing
I hate being over 50. Can someone explain what's going on?
Bro invite him xd
Staged
Cool damn moment to capture - I'd take that heavily into consideration what you folks do for people. Should've say what's up lol
Music, the language of earth. We all love hearing melodic frequencies. This is no accident.
That’s a compliment I’ve only received once 😅. Sorry bud Shazam hates me, come up and have a CD LOL
That’s gotta make you feel good as a producer
Bro tryna shazam it 😂
HE LIKED YOUR GUY’s SONG😂
I’ll tell him!! Not only are you bald, so is the guy making the music!!   You’re welcome.
Call me completely dumb but what is actually happening here? The guy outside knows this dj lives rite there?  I can't see on dudes phone what he's looking at
Who's going to tell me?
Bruh this the biggest setup of all time WHO TF HOLDS THEIR PHONE AT THAT ANGLE EVER
id - id
Damn, artist obviously is an ass
best compliment
That’s awesome
Hes trying to shazam butnits not a real song yet
Awwww
Can someone explain to me
❤ God Bless All Much Love To All ❤️
F’cker just send him the song and stop being cocky
Wholesome
When you don’t realize you’re standing next the the plug 🔌
That’s probably the greatest compliment you can get
Is this fortnite lobby music?? (I don't play fork knife)
man this is beautiful
Well the song sounds basic and reused so yeah, hes trying to figure it out.  Eurotrash
This guy gonna see this and yell at his wife ‘remember I told you about Shazam not working!!’
Give that man a beer damnit 😂
Snag a new fan right there, toss them some track mix downs
Invite this man and give him a demo! First fan before even released!
Is he on Shazam?
It’s a compliment at least 😂
Probably mixed it up with another song. That’s what my Shazam does anyway
It sounds like the background music to a work training video/advert for insurance, who Shazams that? 😅
Tell him what? I don’t get it
I don’t get it😅
Tell him what did I miss something? Wtf is going on.
I love it!
😂
When you meet the plug and don't know it
Bro , you're evil if you didn't tell him
He loves it!
Instead of laughing at him, you could have invited him in.
Shoulda thrown it on a thumb drive for him 😅
Gotta be the producers father lol
That's a sick compliment
That was me all day yesterday
Good mix.
Reminds him of his day on the mediterranean clubbing ig 😂😂😂
What track it is please? 😊
Don't judge him because he might look old. Remember, over here in Europe we have been raving and listening to techno (now called EDM) since the mid eighties. If this dude was, say, 25 years old then, taking ecstasy, being crazy, he would be 64 years old now. He's actually pretty cool to notice your awesome music, it's also a great compliment to you guys for the music you make.
I don't get it
I certainly don’t expect people to film me when I use Shazam on my phone 🙄
That's some compliment 😊
Humbling, right?😄
Shit i still be using Shazam 😅
I need the ID of this tune!!! It’s so good!
I dont get it :/
Dude probably used to trip on acid listening to Underworld live at Glastonbury in the 90s.
Aweeeee❤😅
His trying to Shazam it?
I need this song
So what's the song called?
That gentleman has good taste.
Should have hurried up and quickly switched to the p***hub intro theme music😅😅❤
Damn that’s a huge compliment 😂
What's he doing...?
Drink a coffee smoke a spliff
Personally it sounds like medicine commercial music to me but there are certain times where that would be a vibe. Whenever I Shazam a song its usually when I'm out having a good time.That dude was probably having a damn good day.
WHERE & HOW CAN WE GET THESE BEATS?
this is like the nicest compliment you can get
You should invite him up for something coffee a drink some food idk but he definitely a fan😂😂😂
Go say hello?
He almost found the one piece
I hope y'all told him and didn't just record him. He obviously loved the beats.
What's happening here? I can't see what the man is looking at on his phone... Is it Shazam or soundhound?
lol send em the wav files !
Or he's getting evidence to complain to the popo 🚓🚨
I sure hope they invited him in!
Highest form of compliment for a musician
Music lovers mang!
I don't understand
😂
A man of taste trying to latch onto a decent flavor.
How do you live in a mall?
Old white guy music
why would anyone want to know what this slop is?
You don’t know who he is or why he’s checking. He could have opportunities for you… or he could just be some guy looking for new workout tracks. The only way to find out is to interact, not mock him for being curious.
L.. would’ve been a W if you helped him!
anyways where I can get this music
Such a precious moment
Thats a wholesome moment affff
Whats going on?
They’re all English, if you know what i mean
I tried the same thing till I saw Shazam On his screen🤣
I don’t get it could anyone explain?
Invite that man in you’d blow his mind
As a producer this would make my whole year😂
A bit of context would help.
Maybe you? Instead of filming him and making him look like an idiot in front of the internet and thousands of ppl?
So instead of just recording, did they tell him?
That is a mega compliment holy shit if someone started shazaming my jam I'd be shook
I fucking hate what technology is turning into. Stop automatically connecting things i don't want connected.
That a pack of RAW skins on the table 👀🔥
Man I hope you guys took advantage of this moment and didn't just record 😂
The man just wanted some ketchup... He didn't notice he was next to the factory 😅
Stop being a wanker and give homie them tunes
I like how the drop was delayed at the end 😅
Sounds like a song they would put on a survey ad
Should have invited him
A fan is born
“Mate, it’s a new song we made. Wanna come up and check it out?”  Gain a fan that will promote you until he dies
I'd invite him up 😂😂😂 what a good lad
Bro is scanning  for your music ❤❤ ...   let him meet the producer
Someone put em on, bro loves electronic music too 😂
What a compliment. You should tell him mate.
Tell him what? Like I’m supposed to know what’s going on here. Is something to do with that crappy underwater sounding noise I’m hearing?
Just talk to each-other!
dumb....but cute
Not gonna lie, I thought it was about his kkk looking outfit and the bald head
Lmao at the cackle. Wicked witches cooking up some hot mall beats.
He wants to dance to it in the shower
Whats the song anyways?
That balcony railing table thing is also pretty neat saves space and gives u a place to roll 😎
Nah I’d have to show bro the cook up spot if he’s shazaming my music as I make it that’s a real one 😂
Bruh should have invited him in 😢
Not funny
Imagine trying to find the sauce but you are legit inches from the flowing source....
What a great compliment that would make me feel so good 😂
How good of hm to hold his phone like that so your camera has a clear shot of his screen.
Preproduction. Lol
Mr Clean Mix
Он хочет найти исполнителя, чтобы дать гонорар!
Just in case anyone else needed this tune. Nors Kode - I'm On Fire feat. Michelle Featherstone
This track has got a cool vibe that kinda reminds me of Ben Böhmer! It's like... when you listen, you can catch those subtle hints of his style peeking through the beats and melodies.
Nors Kode - I'm on fire
Shazam is sitting there saying still trying.... 😂😂😂😂
if anyone is, its you recording
Lol if only people did that when I played music instead of hearing that i should turn it off
Can someone explain this to me. Please.
Who’s going to tell him what? You could tell him? This seems like a pretty normal thing to do.
I am not gonna lie this track is dope
Mans got good taste.
Just curious, whereabouts was this filmed?
I do that too, I just have to Shazam every song, sometimes I'm #1!😜
20 years ago he was a raver
😭
It’s obviously Metallica
I still love the Samsung galaxy 8s the screen edge is legendary and I will keep buying one and I don't care about new phones at all and just to tell u they're still running for 400 dollars 💯 that tells u that something 💯 and the new I phones price drops 😂 alot 💯
I always Shazam whenever I'm any store or cafe 🤣
So what is the song ID?
Your first big fan! Lol
What’s so funny?
So where can we get that banger?
CONTEXT??????????????????????????????????????? FUCK!!!
“and wait! For a very limited time, get two for the price of one! Only 10 payments of 49,99$” ahh beat
Best compliment ever
Idiot disrespects Fan. Smh
You failed by not telling him
Couldn't get a better compliment tbh
LOL you shoulda air dropped it to him!!
Yall laughing at someone who enjoys your music. Wonder why yall ain't famous
Maybe he is meaauring the decibles to complain lol
Still don’t get what’s going in
I fucking love this I bet dude was so proud 😂
Wooh😂.. He is using shazam to find out which music🎤🎼🎹🎶
Best feeling for a music producer. ❤️❤️❤️
Bro shazamin the looperino
Guy is looking at his phone so what?
No idea what I'm looking at video is trash
😂Is he trying to SHAZAM that original raw track??👀
Should’ve asked him to take a tour!
Nobody gonna explain what’s happening here?
Shazam!!
Almost sounds like streets with no name
unc a lil confused
Someone vibing to my sound like that... is definitely invite for a drink 😅
That's awesome
So they just happened to spot a random guy listening to their music? Their must be something im missing
Whoops 😂
Did y'all tell him?
Sounds like Erasure. Ya know.. Vince Clark.
Greatest compliment ever!😊
Fake
i really hope you guys gave it to him. people that have shazam downloaded are awesome
Imagine him watching this clip later 😂
Awwww it means its really good 😊😊😊
that like fucking me lol
This has to be the ultimate compliment
loves it.. get around him
That’s a good complement
Fake looks like his dad or something
Is the song going to be released ?
Another "DJ" nice...
Give him that fat kick ❤🎉
thats dope
That’s a pure unadulterated compliment right there
Wtf dym
That is quite the compliment
Name song guys?
Fake and yag
Well, YOU should have told him
WHAT DID HAPPENS HERE?
Worth a trt
Thats when you know your doing something right
I don’t get it
Moby!
Well Shazam would tell him it’s by bill gates .
Very real video
This isn’t music.  Having a laugh ?
Tell him what?
I don't get it
I wouldn’t be laughing I would be inviting that man up and gaining another fan you’re a small producer with only 4000 followers on Instagram you should be grateful for every fan you have
Instead of laughing at him, you should be grateful that someone likes your music enough to try to find out who it is. You could’ve just built another fan there people music forget that’s the only way that they’re successful is through other people liking the music
I’m or curious, who’s gonna tell me?
Thats some good shit hope you gave him the song
🤣🤣🤣
Everyone cant find that using they all so love butbusing Googles sound reading works to find songs even Samsung's too
song name
Little did he know, he was more closer to the source than shazam could ever bring him
I dont get it what is he doing.
I can hear MJ thriller drums
That sounds absolutely amazing what your placing sir. Nice beat, any chance I can find that to listen to!? Much lov
Literally me
Throw him a CD. WOw, I'm old 😢😂
great compliment
Legend say that he's still waiting till this day 😂
Pretty sad how these guys laugh at and mock the guy who really likes their music and is unaware they made it
He's like wow this would be perfect for the intro to the work safety video I show to teenagers at the Bed Bath and Beyond store I manage.
shazammm and the song is found 😂
this would be a fantasy come to life if i was you! hoooolly that’s actually big praise. good looks fellas 🫡
He getting exclusive drops and don't even know it 😂
Phone just shows an arrow pointing at them
So did he actually invite him or not?
Today, on things that never happened
Huge compliment
✊🏾🔥 dudes like “man that’s a banger, wtf is that!?” 😂😂
Esa es una buena manera de saber si lo que haces le va a gustar a la gente. 😅
Compliments to the chef 😊
Help a Ninja out
Geez his smile says ot all
Damn, I like your music!!
I'm glad to see that vibing to your music mid-production with one leg up is a universal thing.
IT'S MOBY  !!1
Inv him over, you can tell he supirts your music. You never know who is listening to it ut could be even so.eone with connects with a label or sum. Thats why i always br nice to poeple unless the act like douches then im going ham and cheese on them mf.😂
Tell him what
Why am I the only one that doesn't understand what's going on here
I'm confused, what's happening here?
The guy is looking at his phone.... I dont get it.
Imagine not inviting that guy upstairs

i thought im the only one doing this in public and trying to hide it lmao
I hope you yelled down at him
Nice 💪

Happens everyday right out side of studios . It sux when artist are scared to publish the good stuff
Nors Kode - I'm On Fire feat. Michelle Featherstone

Biggest compliment

'I'm on fire' Nors Kode
Shazam.!!!😮

Dudes having a grand old time making tunes and enjoying the relaxing meds on the balcony.

If that’s ableton I’m going to break my phone in half
Nst nst nst nst nst.
That’s a great feeling seeing someone doing that to your music
😒🤷‍♂️🙄 give him a copy, nowadays he just gave you the best compliment!
This is me - i shazaam all the time and have it set up to quick shazaam to try and capture asap. Wouldnt be surprised if theres a video of me like this out there.
I know, so many times i cant find the tune cuz of that 😂
That's some way to make someone smile 😂❤
OMG  that's adorable!!! He's trying to jam to your talented tunes ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
He got some taste at least. Why mess around with a nice guy
give hin a sample!!
A good way to not promote your music to people who may like it. lol
A dream of every producer :D <3
He recording his voice ms 😂😂
Not staged at all
He made that Astrazeneca pharmaceutical commercial music. Guys probably a drug rep that's why he was digging it.
What is the song name though??
No idea what's going on here
Was he shazaming it? 😂
Shazam is this shit I don't know how many places I've been and even just ambient sound from ceiling speakers it'll grab
Shazam?
Not gonna lie I probably would have done the same thing. It's a good beat and sounds very well put together.
I don’t understand this
Ya let’s film him and not speak to him….
Moby's trying to steal your song. That's a good sign.
Is he shazaming it?
name of the song?
drop us the song 👍
Thought bro was playing Pokémon go fr
Airdrop it to him😂
Why would laugh at someone enjoying your music? Isn’t this what you aspire to?
Bless
Baldy bully wk...
I dont get it
Tease ...🎉
I dont get it....someone help pls?! 😮
That is actually cool!
How can Mr bald see the old man from the chair?
Unreleased!!
Soon, very soon.
Nothing but bots in the comments.  Don't fall for The Narrative of this video. It's making it look like these guys are the coolest most popular richest best music makers ...but they're white and bald and probably High. Anyone can own a $10,000 laptop computer Studio it's easy... think about how they must have felt to make this video and post it it tells you what they were thinking
Lol is he trying to shazam it?
Where we can find this masterpeace?
Ii can't even have music on  My downstairs neighbour is so unreasonable with music. Should have done better at school and built a house in the middle of a field. Its called social housing clues in the name.
What a smart man
I dont understand
😢 what's the title of the track,?
Stone Roses?
Help me out here..
It's a good sign 😅
What was he doing? Can someone explain it please.
Holidaying Hollywood producer at last finds the track for his next blockbuster movie....but doesn't.
A true man of culture
thatss cute
don't know what was going around so i came here to check that for those who don't know comment..
Who is producing their music so loud the entire street can "enjoy" it ??????
Plot twist hes a music contractor and wants to know if youre signed.
Haha screw him for enjoying your music!
That make me feel really good
Shazam should add the option: id - id.
Got that melosense vibe, it’s so hot right now
Best compliment
My boy getting his ringtone the old fashioned way lmfao 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro same asf! Somebody take uncle Roy to a rave
Biggest compliment a musician could receive ❤   Give that man a tour
Bro when I Shazam I turn my brightness all the way down and turn my phone over 😭. Idk why it’s so embarrassing 💀
give that man a free copy
Who Shazamed the music now?
Is he trying to shazam a song that is still being made? XD i love it
I don’t blame him, this song slaps.
My favorite app
This would make for some epic late night driving music.
Plot twist: It's a stalker and he knew the artist was there, hoping he would get invited in.
Missed opp there for sure
Hahaha shows you have talent for him to Shazam that❤
Even Shazam was confused...
I seriously can’t even understand what I’m watching here…
Music recognition ? 😂🔥
Stolen sample from Ben Bohmer?
Lol
Anyone know what's the name of track? Trying to find this on Shazam while blasting it on my desktop speaker but shit ain't working
Send this dude a copy 😅
We cleared the building before we recorded.
Hahhahah geil
Me😂😂
Plot twist: missed opportunity, the bald guy works for a major recording label.
I mean jokes aside that song  lowkey a vibe
Love all the weed paraphernalia on the window ledge hahahaha
Bro enjoying that department store orientation day music.
I don't get it. Whats happening?
You can't get this one lad 😂😂😂
Ganja Smokers 😅😂
An interested guy on their music I hope at least they talked to him after the video. Man's just trying to vibe with good music
you sitting there watching him but not getting him a cd is the problem
was he recording? Because i dont see any other reason for this clip
What a compliment
That house is so cool. Best spot for dj and sesh on the balcony
Whoa! What the hell is this??...i wanna listen to this on the ride home for sure👏👏🤣👍
this is wholesome, shoulda invited him he'd really appreciated it. maybe email him a 5 minutes loop
Can somebody tell me
Thats a big compliment
Dude liked it and wanted to know who the artist is. Get that fan a free copy.
or just tell him yourself and stop being a tool
What was the guy doing? Using shazam?
Song id?
hahaha... yes that awesome! *sigh* anyway *starts scrolling through your bio for info to find this song*
Yea that’s the dude you invite in and end up having the most epic weekend of all time 😂
that’s actually cool to know someone digs your music
They are both bold so they should definitely become friends
Shazam: “the song you are looking for is not yet done”
Yehthatsawesome should have said something to him lol
Oor hes recording it to file a noise complaint...
At first, I thought it was Moby trying to Shazam the song. That would/would've been pretty ironic and wild.
Like one philosopher I know said “you can “If a man does not have sauce, then he is lost. But the same man can get lost in the sauce.” -GUCCI MANE BURR 1017 BRICK SQUAD
Looks like he was a raver in the 90's
Should have invited him up for a coke and a smoke, you guys had the porch all ready lmaooo
He’s a fan invite him in.
😂😂
that phone would last 5 seconds in NYC Holding it out like that
Track name: this is Tough!  thanks Shazam 😅
I’d be very honored. My family is tired of beats at this point.
Song?
You get his email and send that shit to him!? Wyd giys!?!?!?
Which song of yours is this?
Sound not even done but alredy pirated xD
Damn the artist should've told him the track ID himself.
Niiiiice
Fake. Cause the music is terrible
He is digging your song. Go say what's up.
Dont know what This is supposed to show other than you ridiculing an elder who doesnt get technology
Sounds like he needs ad music…
😂😅this is me  watching people walking past 😂
Too bad I don’t know what the fuck is going on here
hes testing decibals for noise pollution
What is he doing recording?I don't get it
You've witnessed the modern day compliament
Was wholesome until you see their mocking demeanor, like, your track is terrible my guy
Is someone gonna tell you that your beat is entirely derivative and will probably give him dozens of matches
So what is the song name?
Tell him what
Explainnnnnn?
guy liked your vibe 😊🎵🎵
Source: Nors Kode - I'm on fire
awww, that's really sweet!
I wish I could be there when I saw him struggling. I’d be like…  “hey buddy, I think this is an original…”
Let's turn to God Shepherd's Chapel YT explains the whole Bible God bless
Its like the songs they play in the background while the main character tells us what end happened to everybody at the end of the movies 😅
Come on, just tell him and give him your SoundCloud
GOOGLE NOW, RECOGNISES SONGS BETTER THAN SHAZAM, AND QUICKER TOO...TELL YOUR FRIENDS!!  You can even hum the song and it can get it.  True story   😄  Hope this helps!
no one gonna say the song name?!
They are twins... that's not the same bloke
Imagine Shazamming a song that sounds like a Purdue college commercial. Then after you do that lick my entire asshole
His use app who can hear your song and id it eady if that song in list world internet
Should be humble it’s hard to find genuine fans for this kinda music that arnt 12 or on drugs
I can’t Shazam it either 😢
So instead of telling him you take the piss out of him
that's not music 😂 that's just samples
What’s the song? Now I want it
I'd try to do that too. Obviously put him in a good mood
Producing and big rolling papers on the balcony is the best combination!
Props to you mate ..good beat
Shamelessly Shazaming in public... definitely a DJ
Wait.. what is wrong.. what is the guy doing
He’ll never forgive himself for never finding that song
Tell him what? He's holding a phone.
Should’ve hooked up the airdrop lol
That must feel amazing
perfect :-)
????
My first thought was who tries to shazam the BBC intro
Can I shazam this shazam which is the shazam that guy is getting I mean I ain't never shazammed before dudes but i'm guessing i need yt premium so i can close the app but plat the music and fking shazam up a storm but it costs extra oh the dilemma from one short. Shazam on g's and gzettes
just tell me they told him so I can go to sleep lol.
После такого вы должны были скинуть ему это демо в Wav формате,чтобы он наслаждался этим прекрасным моментом
I mean, it’s probably better than what you look in the mirror every day at
So real, non scripted perfection.
I'm 67 years old and to most young people I'm old but they do not realize that is my generation that put this sound on the map, clubbing from the age of 20 tue the 70's and 80's and 90's and we still pay attention to the house sound that came from the original Disco era
The dream of any producer
so what’s it called though
He wants to use your song in a background video promoting his socks and undies Ecommerce business. That's all
Thats awesome! Compliments! Always a good time!
Bro needed that ad music for the playlist
Hail Shazam😂🤣
Please tell him!!!! Not finding a song is a top 10 bummer
Moby Jacking beats lol
introduce that man to the internet, millions of generic songs like this one
Dude looks like a classical guy, or even a secret metal guy. But he's definitely an edm guy and probably a eurovision guy too.😅
Isnt their an app that can identify music thats playing?? I think its called Shazam
Oh he's shazaming it !!!??  Ohh😅😅😂😂
How cool 😊
That's beautiful 🤩
You. You should tell him ....
BRO TELL HIM
You gotta tell ‘em you made it at that point😂😂
And then a year later he stumbles upon your song and has the hugest epiphany
ok tell him what🤔🤔 and WTF is he even doing😳🥺
😎😎😎
I love this. I wonder how many times this has been the reason for my "no results" 🎶❤
Me trying to find the djs set that dosent exist as a song🎉
Bald guys think alike. (Jk)
Pure moment. Then again if you told someone youre an artist and tried to show them theyd say its not that good. When i used to play guitar infront of my "friends" theyd either say it wasnt good or "what song is that" "Its not a song i made it up" "No ive heard that before, its a song(person who has never played an instrument" "Okay but its not i literally just made it up just now"
He tried to
That is so incredibly beautiful
Is he doing Shazam 😭 man I'd die if anyone did that to my beats. I'd be so happy
who the hell is gonna shazam some random commercial sounding garbage shi
Is that shazam?
Thats the ultimate compliiment
Thought buddy had a speaker in that bookbag at first🤣
I have no idea what’s happening here
Are we supposed to know who is this guy at the computer desk?
Doesn't exist yet homes
invite him inside 😂😂😂
lol coming soon
Can’t Shazam it
Some guy swore he heard my song before but I had just recorded it 😅😅😅 best feeling ever when someone can’t believe it’s you
Sometimes... you just know it's your jam and you gotta hear it again. 😂
Maybe he wanted to know what track it was so he can make sure never to hear it again
What if he was watching porn
Good morning word 😂😂😂😂
I guess I will… Not all hero’s wear capes
So, I am the guy shazaming in this video.    An old friend of mine just sent the video to me.  This is absolutely amazing.  No, I'm joking sorry, I'm just an asshole adding another comment under another random YT video.
Ableton gang
Did it drop yet?
Idk what's happening
hes doing pokemon go :P
So what the hell is the name of the song?!
That’s got to feel amazing
I play records / vinyl at raves and parties .  It is not good if you play rubbish pop music like that 😂

He’s playing Pokémon go on his phone
Haha nice. Dude was thinking that shit sound good when Im rolling on that Molly I got at the crib.

He's like "Damn, this shit slaps"
He trying to shazaam the song but the song just got out the oven lol I felt that, that be me stopping at random trying to catch a song I liked

Bro instant fans are hard to come... He's "Shazaming " those tunes
Bro that's a virtual compliment. Invite him in my guys ❤
Can't blame him, sounds sick! 🔥 You can't get more appreciation than this 😂💪
Hell yeah I would be that dude
Are we supposed to know wtf is going on in this blurry ass video?
Not smoke too much wheed
"that's a nice little rhythm there aint it"
YOU should tell him you’d have a new fan
He could of been someone you need 😢
I guess you could...
So this is white people music hmmm not bad.
Invite my man up, have a smoke or a drink, be a great vibe and an awesome experience

When you’re so underground😂
The best compliment you could receive

"Music"..
Bro loves the 5 minute crafts ahh music
Conservative confliction video - level 10
Invite him to see & hear it being done!
Was he on Shazam trying to find the song 😂 i hope yall told him or gave him it
A proud moment for Mr producer!!!
Song is good but I would have assumed a million songs would have popped up
This is what its all about
What is Norse Code?? Some kinda Viking Morse Code??
Why let them smoke inside if you are going to stare at their every move 😂
Is nobody going to point out how cool it would be to have an apartment like that?? 😳❤️❤️
My dad loves music like this always shazams it. Next time invite the guy up you’d prolly have fun around the old head
Is He Doing Shazam? 😁😁🤘🏻
:D so many "old guy likes new music" comments - You kids do realize we / him are children of the 80's & 90's right?
I thought he was on hold lmao.
He was going to post that shit on stories hashtag vibing
When i watch porn hope it goes to someones screen share tv 🐒
Sue him copy rights it's looking like he's recording your work without permission.
Someone’s feeling it, hell ya
Anyone know the song tho? I wanna jam it on my road trip this weekend
He is like why can't I find it with Shazam😅
To all these people who don't know he thinks his phone is ringing , your all welcome ... No please stop being a bunch of parrots and stop saying it's a compliment to the artists because none of y'all had any idea what's happening in this video ....
That is a good beat!
Me when searching live music.
Moby
Why laugh at him when he likes your stuff
Ill tell him.... "dude thats not a song, its just a bunch of random sounds"
I tried the same thing with some abandoned military base in belgium where a bunch of french teens on LSD had their own techno mixes. Sounded sick af, unfortunately no shazam discoverirs 😢
If you didn't invite him in you lost a potential fan and promoter
The clip is just as shitty as the music
Yeah right
Everyones a dickhead nowadays, dont film him laughing, say hey, and send him the song or something.
Should have had him come up!
Bless him
What a compliment 😁👍🏻
bro i fantasize about shit like shit like this lmao
Sounds like killer hold music
I don't understand
Should have air dropped him the file
He's measuring the DB's and then call the cops.
Did not get it. Please someone elaborate
Should of letting him know and got him info until the song was finished and released
Yeah, sooo.... Where can I get this track. Like for real. Can I listen to it somewhere?
What the actual fuck is this guy listening to? Youtube ad music?
Tell him what???
That is so fucking cool
He said, baby im in the party rn with the company
This is super cute. I love it. No rules for the love of music
I hope you told him
That’s awesome.
Should of recorded you telling him about it .. wpuld he wholesome to watch 💙
Wow that's amusing .
Sounds more old school... believe me its a complement 😉😉
It's wii back ground music.
"Hey go open Shazam and go outside real quick."😂
I know that feeling when shazaam won't shazaam.  You walk away feeling defeated.
He is recording for a noise complaint
Total setup ha ha ha
My biggest fear is someone catching me shazam in public
at that point i’d just write a contract saying if he gives it out to anyone he have to pay me and just give him the sauce
Yeah total compliment when a random person discovers a nee feature of their phone while you essentially play elevator music 😅
Doing that is the biggest compliment , makes me want to cry
this is soo me shazaming stuff
This shit makes you feel so good inside
He would have gotten an invitation
Brother is trying to figure out which artist produced this elevator music.
Well thats gotta make ur buddy feel good about his beats🤣
???
? I don’t understand.
Whats the name of the track?
Shazam
Old man knows whats good
He's just making a bootleg
I love it too 😂
My man asking for sauce yet somehow he's at the actual SOURCE! 😂
That's such a nice street music award :D
How can u deduce anythijg frok this
Im confused whats happening
Nice beat
Bro send him the file
It’s just sleep music 😂
cant tell you how many times i was this dude lol
Reminds me of that ego death feeling once you get over that nervous hum on your acid trip and it’s all smooth sailing from there
That’s a good sign…
Bro probably deleted Shazam after that. 😂 "Ah this shit never works anyways!"
You should take that as a compliment
So fake
Very few better complements.  fuck yeah lol
i like the raw papers :P
Dude literally only has the doors wide open to blast his music to everyone including those who don’t wanna hear his junk
What a beautiful moment of positive connection between strangers. My favorite thing in life
Shazam and sound hound are the real heroes
Unreleased!!!!
Whats he doing? Tell him what
He’s stealing that shit😂
Aye noice send him the finished product hes bouta show everyone at wine and yoga night
I dont even get it
Hey Let's film the dude and put IT on the net ... People dont care about fan no more
Is he tryn to use a music recognize app to check your actual project? If, its kinda nice, hope you send him on a trip then. Musican2🎉
Invite him over!
Bro, how are you not gonna go down and say what up and give him the song name or a exclusive download. That dude is a brand new fan (possibly) and definitely deserves some attention
This is soooooo sweet!!! What a compliment
I didn't realise what he was doing at first but I'm right with him, I want to hear more of it. There are some really great sounds in there.
hope ya send him the file
Hey man that should be flattering as hell
You?!
Highest form of flattery
What is this song called?  Someone please help
I don't get it
Can someone possess the six eyes but not the limitless?
Whos going to tell me lol
I don’t understand broke can someone explain this in iPhone terms
Really cool to catch that moment on video.
Your humor is top-notch.
Maybe next year
YOU! You gotta tell him😂 It’s like smelling good food hoping to see a restaurant but it comes from an apartment window hahaha
An older man trying to Shazam your beat must be the best compliment of them all. No joke.
Damn I hope he found it.  Shazam can be surprisingly clutch
Who in their right mind would shazam this shite music.
Idk what's happening 😅
thats fuckin awesome
I love this so much you don’t even understand
Thanks for explaining that he is trying to find out what song is playing,  otherwise i wouldn't have deduced wtf this video was about
I don’t get what’s happening
Damn bro , they made him dirty 😂
thats legit
Nice sound 👌🙌🙏❤️
Its got comfy weather report vibes
Anyone else notice the grinder and rolling papers?!!! 💨
Freshly cooking in the studio not out yet my guy 😅
I dont get it
I didn’t understand what was going on until I read the comments. Thank you all for that. Edit: Can this song be found on YouTube?
Im out of the scene now and the djs have changed just since like 2016 or after actually. Such is life I respect anyone who makes it and doesn't fck life off.
Welp he ain’t finding anything lol
Why does it seem like everyone in the comments knows what is going on but me? What am i missing?
Best video I watched so far😂
Jit fena go home and dance
before i was into this i used shazam too xDD hope you helped him out afterwards :D hes liek tryign to escape the radiocrap matrix be his morpheus :D
Whats happend ? Is he recording?
Recently I was showing off some original loops and songs that I created with GarageBand and my little homie pulls out Shazam just to make sure I wasn't copying somebody's music I told him "that came from my head bro"😂
Throw that man a USB Stick. He’ll be entertained for hours
Oooohhhhh lol
I don’t get it ?
Pura mierda el señor queriendo saber cuál es 😂😂😂😂😂
Old man wants to rave!!!
Awww that's such a compliment
That’s awesome
It could be me
Not fake at all 😢😢😮😮
What a compliment
It’s good, if I was giving a presentation on slavery. Or maybe if I was a scam caller and I put you on hold music. Could even pass as elevator music at a Womens rights conference. 🤣
WHAT IS THAT MELODY!!!
Dude is your fan! hell yea
Thats me as well as a producer
Thats gold 🥇 gots to feel good 😅
That's me 💀👀
If I made music and saw someone trying to Shazam it, I’d invite them up for a coffee the fuck lmao. Thats awesome
I don't get it.
700
He just wanted to vibe
Tell him what
Someone help a “boomer” out and explain what I’m seeing 👀
In all seriousness, is this song finished now? I like it myself 😂
Henry New York city wondering the purpose of this video I don't understand?
Can someone explain what's going on plz
Can someone explain what going on?
One day someone in my neighborhood played the guitar and I did try shazam it too even though I knew it wouldn't work. I was walking around trying to get the location of the music. I would have knocked on the door and asked what the song was called but I still don't know and that's sad.
What's the song??
Send him a copy
Awesome 😂
Lol shazam
Lol not out yet bredren
Poor guy. Got an entire app for that and still can’t find that shit 💀
Can someone please tell me what's going on here??
Not gonna lie I'd do the same thing
Shazam gave him completely different song as usual
Bring that man up!!! 😂😂😂
Hello Anjunabeats family 👋♥️
That would be such an amazing feeling to be honest. Nobody knows or cares about my music 😂
Dad go shazam my music on video so I can trick people into asking about it.
What am I not understanding here? Is this dude somebody?
Is he trying to Shazam the song you're in the process of creating?
That pot plant stand ❤
Song please
Boring music.
This video is awesome, the music, the legendary old boy listening in, the superlong skins on the table! cool vibe man.
Thats such a compliment.
Same tho
Awe that's such an awesome moment!!
poor fellas gonna have that beat stuck in his head for the rest of his life
INVITE INVITE INVITEE..looks like a fun guy mannn
Track id?
Can't find that on Shazam baby 😂

Man this reminds me of forza horizon 3-4
Track ID? 😅
Tell him what?  What is happening?
No shazaming that!😂❤
Awwwww 🥰
Thats awesome!    He'll forever be trying to find said song.
What am I looking at?

Tell him what fs
Shit if it was me producing that i would've walked out there a been like album drops August 31st sorry for the wait
give the dude an mp3
I don't get what's going on here 🤔
This could be me! 5 seconds are enough to say thats an absolute quality progressive Banger! Is it released and whats the name please! :DDDDDD #YOTTOSTYLE
Gwann send him a lossless and tell him not to share it🤪
This is absolutely heartwarming
Why is there so many punks like this laughing at everyone that don't seem as " pretty "?
Shazam!
He reported a bug with the app later 😂
Dude thats so sweet. He tried to Shazam it
I need more info on this ! Lol
That is a massive compliment to any artist
Is he shazaming you 😂 ❤
had this happen to me at a beat set I did, had to break buddies heart and let him know it was an original lol
That's Paul Kalkbrenner's father wandering the city and stealing hits.
High praise
In the end, it turns out that it's Paul Kalkbrenner's father in search of new hits xD
Aww, that's a nice compliment!
Fr thoe what’s the name of the song
Its really cool when you hear new music being created live somewhere
That’s how you find the cool old people that no longer dress the way they are
So hes trying to look up the name of a song that's currently still being produced?
Trying to Shizam him lol
Whats up? I dont get it
Bruh could record the exclusive on his phone 😂
Bring him up! That's a kindered spirit, baby!
Wait what is he doing?
Sounds like waiting music
Waiting for andriid to give him the song name and artist.
man i really hope they told him, poor guy lol
Who is this? The producer? I’d?
Get his address and send him a copy
Lol i enjoy it too nice can u upload
Can someone explain
Lean over and be like "you won't find it mate, you're at the source"
My instant thought was (Invite him in!) and to open the comments and see so many like minded people has restored my faith in humanity. Music creates new connections, memories and happiness all over the world. Hope anyone reading this a like, has a wonderful day! ❤
maybe you should ?
What?
""""artist"""""
Forgive me but wth is going on here?
Shoulda yelled down the track title for him, then had him up to show him the goods.  Would have made his day, and some primo content
Yeah I’m letting that dude kick it and listen inside.
Coolest thing i've seen on the net😂🤣🤣
What am I looking at?
Bro is tryna get google to tell him the song 😂😂😂
Nice view love that place already
Going to tell him what? A little context would be nice.
Stop shaking the baby😂😂😂
Need to make this dude your friend
Man bro. How many times I've heard a mix and had that same feeling. Like I'll probably never hear this sound again. 🥺😔
U definitely should’ve invited him
Awe that's a HUGE compliment!
If you didnt go talk to that dude😭
If you want People to like your Music, then don’t treat them like a joke.
Cookin’ up crack in tha cabin 🎶
"It's not out yet mate. You are not going to find it on Shazam." Guy "How do you have it?" Producer "Wanna see my setup?"
That must be the best compliment you can receive without receiving
Wtf is this
What is going on here?
I have no idea what's happening.
could you please release it
Don’t get it
I'm confused. Don't hate but can somebody tell me what's going on here? What am I missing
He sent it to his friend and said “listen to this garbage we all have to hear just walking down the street” I’m jk, sounds great.
You can shazam it now brother lol
What is going on there?
Whats he doing shazamin it 😂
Heey love it, I also  want to listen to full song 😅😅😅
Is he stealing your music I'm confused
that’s when you know it’s heat
My most used app is Shazam
Good idea, send your dad outside n get him to act this out.
That's a compliment! You should have invited him on a cup of coffee and showed him around 🙂
What a legend.. he likes your tunes 🎵💎🎵
그래서 노래 제목이뭔데요 좋네요
So what's the song?
cheers comments.. too daft to figure out at first he was  *what song is this shit?*  :)
This is legendary!
I don't get it what's going on?
Yes, lets just laugh at this guy who seems to enjoy the jam we created enough to want to know who created it. Thats a great idea, yes, perfect.
I don't get it ?
?
He wanted to know who made that track   Invite him over - make a live stream/vlog   Make more wholesome content with the bloke
Damn that’s what’s up!
Literally the best compliment a play test could get haha 😂
This was staged…. The camera man just so happened to be filming, while looking out the window at random passersby’s at the exact moment someone was “trying to Shazam the song” that wasn’t even playing loud, bc you clearly hear the dude at the computer laugh over the music.     Yeah right.
*Where's that link though, was this beat ever released?* Edit: Norse Kode - I'm on Fire
What song is this tho fr?
Invite him in bro
Damn people rlly do listen to that😂
Der muss aufs Cover
most definitely a catchy tune
What? I don’t get it lol
The best feedback ever on your track 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Computer music isn't music it's an oxymoron
I'm sure I've never heard of you
Be funny if it gave him a artist and he walked off 😂
What is happening here?
When you're trying to close your Shazam app so you can call the cops on a noise complaint
When you can't detect the song you know you found the source.
ID BE PISSED IF NOTHING CAME UP 😂
Don't get what's happening here
LAWLZ
Someone tell me whats happening! Why is he looking at his phone?
Think of all the great music no one will ever hear.
I feel bad for the guy he wanted the song name from Shazam but the song name doesn't even exist because it's not completed
You just got the greatest compliment of all time.
I learned something new today!
Me as a musician will be a treasure  for me and my style glad a sibling is a fan of music as well
! NO RESULT We didn't quite catch that. Try again?
He was trying to add music to his book club playlist.
very wholesome
I dont get it. Whats going on
I thought he was on Pokémon Go 😭
What is he doing?
That’s gotta be the biggest compliment you could give a producer haha
You even dont know how to smoke weed 😅so your music is 4autism people
So whats the song? 😅
Damn bro you can’t even like something nowadays without getting clowned. He’s not even doing anything wrong. When you hear a song you don’t know you “Shazam it” 😂 you could’ve at least let him know and given him your handle.
"That's taking too long"  Hey why don't you go upstairs and ask?!
Get him the song now please 🥺
Shazam? Or soundhound?
Oh my god that’s so wholesome 😊
That’s so wholesome 😭 older guy loves the new music.
I be doing the same 😂😂😂
When is it coming out🥹🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Dudes trying to Shazam a ringtone
Yo siempre a donde voy con mi reconedor de musica 😂😂😂😂😂
For me it would be a big compliment if someone would just stand there and try to Shazam the music i make :D
Man I feel great when people Shazaam my Spotify playlist. I can imagine how good it feels to have that while you're playing live😮
Shazam is confused 😅😅
Fr I woulda been like yooo that's me !!!
Shazam is still a thing 😂😂😂😂😂
Well now the internet needs to find this guy to get him the song
take that as a compliment instead of laughing at the dude, give him your some tags so he can find your music.
He probably would've been a chill dude to give a little tour, probably never expected it to be the person making the song.
My dream set up
Horseshoe baldness is a stamp from GOD to warn you they are predators 🤮cain was marked also. Don't believe me? Look at how many chomo mugshots. It starts with the receding hairline resembling devil horns👹demons manifesting through the body🤮
😂😂😂
Yhat is how most of the 90s techno artists look nowadays... 50-60 years old
Shazam sometimes it does not work.
I did that to my neighbours once lucky they weren't home took me a few minutes to find where my music was playing lol😂
dude that's fucking great hell yeah hahaha
Shazam is gonna tell him actually
Kaza?
So many people here would just invite some stranger into their house because they're listening to music they made lol, nah
Aww that is really awesome
Making music is like therapy I swear.
He's trying to shazam lol
I'm unsure of what I'm witnessing. Enlightenmen me.
lmao thats how you know a song is gonna be good, is it out yet?
Imagine shazam showing the track id already
I’m an artist but I have no idea what’s going on
Great tunes
He's definitely not showing you his screen at all. Whatever though. Lasy af.
And you mock him. Wow. Shows the level of your arrogance. Let’s all boycott his music
Hell yeah
I'd of lowered the volume
My guy. How could you not upload that track to youtube as he was searching it?
He's a major fan even rocking the same haircut
Goals
You! You should be telling him! There is literally no one else that could 😅😂
to be honnest i shazamed this video of a guy tryin to shazam this dope track
PUT A DESCRIPTION
Dude looking at his phone wondering how such a small phone produces as much noise as a nightclub on a Saturday night.😂
I hear a fart at the beginning.
Whats he doing recording it from outside??? Whats going on here
People  believe anything,... got there mate to go outside and acts likenhe wanted to know what that shite was
Is that Mr beast after a hair cut.
My guy should have just followed the scent of cannabis
I don’t blame him. Sounds absolutely ethereal and nostalgic. Reminds me of when the grass was green.
" I heard some great music for when ppl get put on hold at our office but I couldn't quite get it."
There both bald and youre wondering why they have similar taste?
I use Shazam anytime I don’t recognize a song or artist. I want to appreciate art when I hear it.
And, what's the tune name????? 😁
That'll be me in 20 years. 😂
Mysterious times
why does this music sound like something id hear over a scam advert?
I would have done the same 😂
That’s awesome
Song name:  Nors Kode - I'm On Fire
I also tried it. Nothin :(
hurry up and drop😂
I don't get it anyway, it just sounds like generic music you'd put to a classroom demonstration video or background music to a B movie... It's unoriginal sequenced tones with off the shelf patches. I did music when music was hard. People can buy all these recording and synth software, but the people doing it have no clue how to get the most out of their equipment, but all of that is nothing if you don't have a song in your heart. This is in tune and in beat, but it's not from the heart. Just a couple quick keystrokes looped in a sequence. Goes to show how bad humanity has gotten that people don't seem to get music the way it's meant to be got. Even the guy on the street has been so censored from great music that he thinks this is something worth downloading 😂
Was that shazam? 😂
Set up
Show me how to make this music.
Respect
Some people is so nice  They can enjoy anything ❤❤
you must have been sat there waiting for someone to look like they were about to get their phone out and shazam the track.
Unreleased Artist - Unknown Track
My favorite genre 😍 ❤ This is what I drive to
Reminds me of mr beans holiday
bro really wanted to listen to that Youtube tutorial ahh track
sick
You can't but an age on good taste in music.
OK tell him what ?
oh i thought this was "put on hold" or elevator music amd he was calling
"Artist not found" yetttttt
That’s awesome! 😂
Is that guy trying to identify the song? The resolution on the video is low
Thw funny thing is. You guys think youre making music but an ordinarybperson things its a ring tone.
It took me way too long to realise what was going on 😂
You should tell him. That's a customer right there.
You gotta tellhim
Let’s go ableton 😤
It really have to be a woman laughing at that.
That old man is not trying to figure out what you’re playing… tell your dad he can come back up now that you finished making your video
I used Shazam for Native American music. It doesn't work.
So cool!
@Nors Kode
Shazam - I am listening
Laughing at the appreciation.. sends a terrible message to the universe 👎
He’s got the whole ‘take my good hand child’ going on there
Bro really sittin there trynna get music for his elevator
Dreary music.
He loves elevator music
Track ??
Time for a pint
Have no idea whats going on here
You see an old man ish old ish and you think he's never had an amazing experience with music i lost my sister in October and a smell and music are the only things that can make me feel like she's still alive or make me cry im telling you music goes as far back as humans do from drying out a goats skin and stretching it over a 🪵 hollowed out yeah you can feel it's in our 🧬🧬🧬🧬🧬🧬 well i can if i hear a song from the mid 90s i believe in time travel as im wisked off to who and where we all were and dancing the night away@16yrs old💯❤️🙏🏻🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Could just be testing the app 🤷‍♂️
is he shazammin it? LOL thats awesome
He wants to remember the nice trip with your unreleased music.
Ayoooo 💯💯💯
SHAZAM!
Having a brain fart here.  Could someone please explain this short to me?
Gottaairdrop the beat
For a guy who used to get dizzy as fuck trying to read a label from a spinning disc, two meters away from the DJ booth, 6 am with one eye closed because using two, would've definitely send me to another universe..... I can say shazam is soooo underrated . Rip napster, emule, audiogalaxy, kazaa, odc, strong dc, edonkey and 56k dial up modems :):):):)
More like he's sick of the noise and measuring decibels for the council
This guys probably like, “this music would be great for a new employee training video, let me save this”
Tell him what?!
Tell him what fuck off?
I hope u told him 😅
Gave me a genuine smile this one :)
That is too cool
He’s trying to find out what song it is. With that music app
You?
Hey dad do us a favour, stand outside n pretend to Shazam this track, it’ll make a great TikTok
Dmca free type beat
#ThatHappened
Don't get it
That guy looks like he’s a talent scout for telephone queue jingles.
How rude is knock the door and ask the name of the track or the name of producer to follow for next release songs?
He's tryna Shazam that shit!!!😂
That man either knows where you stay and is trying to impress you or you know that man and its staged for publicity 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 great tune though 👌
That a cheeky pack of raws i saw?
UPDATE i get it .....phew .....
Uh?          Im high ! .....someone explain , gently please ? Oh and im English 😂😅
Хорош трек 😊
Would be better if it was younger people instead of seniors OAP.
🎶🥸✅
Lol
So, you're actually lame, for just recording this...
Is he trying to record the song for an app to tell him what it is Bro just f****** tell him what's your issue
That’s cool
This "music producer" doesn't know the other guy is a "legit producer"😂
Tell him what?
In this even music 🤮
Does someone want to explain please?
Oh.no....totes embarrassing, turns out he was REALLY checking his voicemail...😮😂
I'm on fire
Aw dude. A fan must always be protected. That’s code
Shazamm
Meanwhile jus tryin to steal the wifi 😂
Possibly this - Dont give up by Jose Sanramarina
Had to read the comments to understand what is happening here. Apparently the guy is using an app to learn what song is being played.
Looks like a db reader ,prolly a complainer.
Wow - so confused at 1st glance... thought a call was coming in and this guy trying to answer it but not realizing it's coming from upstairs😂😂
Haha goals
What’s he doing?
Bro you better say something to him
D
Shazam doesn't Work 🤣🤣🤣
He's got good taste 👌
Artist and track?
Never judge a book by its cover, music goes deep.
Did they airdrop him it lol
The Song is called Darude - Sandstorm
WHATS IT CALLED TELL ME!!@!!!!!!!!
Best feeling as a producer, worst feeling as a regular guy 😢
"whos gonna tell him?" ... well not you apparently ... and thats where you fucked up
So this the dude making the music playing in the back of the safety videos at work
Dunno if it’s quite out yet if dudes still working on it 😂
Hes in the basement looping that to a mix hes created for his own dj set
Who's going to tell him what? Is he recoding their music?
Seriously though what’s the song and where can I listen? 😅
Massive complement
Nors kode - im on fire.......thank me later 👌
I know a pack of Raws when I see them 😉😶‍🌫️😤
He’s tryna find your music. Get your ass down there and give him a bad boi freebie
Ich hatte mal einen tanzenden Polizisten vor dem Fenster als ich mit meiner korg mx gerockt habe 😊
bro you gotta let him come check out the setup and get his email to send him the track when its released
Hey someone loves you mannnn
Oh i get it. Hes trying to search for the creator of the song, right?
Bullshit, you see him nearly look up at the beginning. This sounds like music you'd hear when on hold to o2 customer service 😂😂😂😂
Dude that's gotta be the most satisfying feeling
👍👍🕺
I actually want to know the name of this track now
I did what that old man did. Now I feel weird about it😢
Invite the brother in lol 😂
That guy has the best feeling in his pants, go see a proctologist loser 😮😅
Bros making a traveling ad song
Missed opportunity he works for EMI records
Gonna be proud
😂😂😂
Old White guys do enjoy elavator music
Took me a while to realise what was going on 😂
I'm the need shazaming everything
Ok but what is the song tho 😅
Erste Generation Techno halt, was gibt es da zu wundern
Big up the RAWS 👊🏻👊🏻😂😂
Love this
I would send him the track as a gift❤
That’s your number 1 fan and you let him slip away.
Siempre hago lo mismo 😂😂😂
That's me right there. 😊
Don’t just stand there , help a brother out you pillock
I don't even know wtf this is
Ah what a lovely compliment! ❤
Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.
Why the fuck they didnt invite him
You guys already made it lol
Should have invited him in, he clearly enjoys your music and would have probably made this guys whole year
How about helping an old guy and make his day instead of making fun of him online
He needs the exclusive version 😂
Shazam "not responding" try again later!
He is a spy from other producers
I didn't understand
You’re basically torturing him 😄🤘
Love when the older gen gets into edm
Tune 😅
Ben Böhmer
Who else tried to shazam and got no result? 🤣
😂
Music name??PLS🥹🥹
What was the song? I’ve heard it before on late 8 I’m sure 😊 ( edit - found it - Nors Kode - I'm On Fire feat. Michelle Featherstone)
What’s he doing ?
I hope you told him the release date !
Yeah bald ppl usually do have a shitty taste in music 😂😂 this video just further proved it
send him a vip version in 192 kb quality and he is the happiest man on the world😂😊
ID - ID
How about you tell him…
This is gold would love to know if the track was ever released!
Amazing. What a compliment.
Awesome
People who came to the comments to look for the ID 👇🏼
Ableton 🎉
Shazam❤ best app ever!!!! This app can find literlly every song. And this dj just make a good job!
Could someone explain just what in the wide world of sports is going on here? As a non-computer compliant boomer I'm completely lost yet annoyingly curious.
I’ll tell him

The bald dude has a record label and just stole your concept.
Very very nice
Raw papers on the table 🙏
