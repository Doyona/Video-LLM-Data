As a Spanish supporter, we don’t claim Eliot  He’s not from Spain or has any ounce of Spain blood  He’s born in Germany , he’s German  And his parents blood is from Georgia  That’s why he reps Georgia so much  But let’s be real not from Spain  And doesn’t even have a resident card for Spain
Georgian Power 👊 El matador  🕶 Ilia Topuria ❤❤❤ The best 🦾
ian not his last name garry
I just love Merab Dvalishvili. I hope he will defend his soon belt for a long time.
Bernabeu is not an indoor arena
No rematch, it will happen again smh
Stalin was Georgian as well…
so can they make khabib vs gsp for ufc 300?
Umar's got to get to the end of the line. These imports ask the most stupid questions
lol u call that prize money?I wouldnt get out of bed for that pocketmoney   aussie champ 💪🏻💋🇦🇺
Ian Garry's favorite fighter is Ian Garry lol 🤡🤡😂😂🤣🤣💯💯
Thinking that ain't water in Dana's cup.
Volk should call Chuck Liddell about sticking around too long.
Strickland vs rob
“Did they have a date for Spain…?”Volk seems so desperate to get his rematch.
Volk is the man regardless of winning or not. He took it like a champ.
The key to the knockout was Ilia's framing Volk with his left hand. That froze Volk in place and neutralized his counter-right (couldn't turn into the punch). Ilia threw his right hand with perfect technique, and Volk was lucky the follow-up left hook missed.
Crazy
Dana’s on coke
Man I LOVE Ian Garry and him shutting up all the weak fake hate from you halfway mma “fans” this guy’s got it 👏👏💪💪
Not giving Chair Diaz Performance of the night is inexcusable
I think Ian did himself justice in this interview.
Increible Ilia, el trabajo duro y el creer en ti mismo han echo sus frutos, pedazo de ko al mejor campeon peso libra volka, ya estoy esperando para verte en españa🇪🇦
It was a good card. I had paulo and Volk winning but didn't go that way. Still a good night. 😲
Henry didn’t show huh?
Respect to illia for the performance but not willing to rematch volk or wanting to fight the top 5 fighters who does he wanna fight? Lmfao an unranked FW or a washed Mcgreggor?
Dana says other people deserve immediate rematches like izzy but basically shoots down volk lol
Hair today gone tomorrow Gaz
If they dont give volkanovski the immediate rematch that will be extremely disrespectful and pretty ungrateful. They give rematches to everyone. Even fighters who haven't defended the belt one time. I dont think there is any argument in saying he has earned it 10 times over. That being said i would love to see Max fight that dude. I think Max with his length , accuracy and output would really put it on that dude
No more immediate rematches, please.
Why peeps asking Volk dumb questions
Sheep jumping against ian .im still supporting
I love  Merab throwing shade at Aljo saying he beat Yan and Cejudo "no split decision."
The truth is..
Whittaker is one of my favorite fighters 🙌
Not giving Rob and Paulo bonuses is atrocious
Just noticed now...Conor will never fight again. He thinks, if he loses - and gets embarrassed too. His 'image' loses too. Lmao but if he doesn't fight it's another loss  😂👎
Ian need to start wearing a leash😅
About time LEON GOT SOME PUBLIC RESPECT FROM THE UFC
These ake journalists are morons and ask the dumbest questions. WTF? "Why did you put Wanderlei in the HoF?" "How far do you think Ilia will go as a champion?" "Would you give Zuckerberg a fight." "Can you explain the Tafa brothers switching places?" "Topuria changed his social last week to say he was champ. What does that say about his confidence?"   I know 12-year old MMA fans that would ask better questions. Heck, a potato would ask smarter questions. No wonder Dana is so confused by the questions and has to ask, "What are you asking me?!" multiple times. I think he's stunned by the dismal IQs.
Usman & Volk are the two greatest examples of being great champions and going out on your shield.
Theres ALWAYS someone better out there, its been that way throughout all of history. Its just a matter of time before they showcase thier skills!!
Talk about cultured man, German, Georgian, Spaniard, and now Champion  great job Ilia Topuria.
Congratulationa Ilia ❤🌹
Love Whittaker
Crazy that these videos always cut off the very beginning. I hate to be negative but why??
Merah is so boring fighter.
He is going to be Champ for very long time guys and he beat Max and Ortega. Vi will see when these fights going to happens in future
Skipped Ian MACHADOS ass 😂
Every time a dominat champ loss what jon jones has done seem even bigger
I knew ilia was gonna win and i only first checked him out when he was first arguing with paddy at a presser a year ago
VIVA EL REY Y VIVA ESPAÑA 🇪🇸💪🏻
Fight of the night was dern and not Paulo and Rob??? Whaaaaatttt
Crazy how Izzy and Volk both gave title shots to people slightly down in the rankings who hadn’t really fought the top 1-3 in the rankings and lost their belts to both
No rematch ffs, he just got knocked out cold in r2, he needs to step down and try to bounce back. All these rematches is fucking up the rankings
If they make Sean vs Rob it has to be 5 rounds
With the way of the land for Featherweight and Lightweight. i think if Ilia defends against Volk now, that he should probably challenge Makhachev after that tbh. just me but that would be massive
Pod casts are really called   Grass shops
Dana you say yes to Robert but no comment to alex
what fucking drugs is dana on wtf
Did not expect Whittaker to not give credits to Costa. Saying what kick after that kick made him wobble is not Robert we are used to know.
I hate Ian
Huge volk fan from Australia but you really gotta give it to Ilia, man left no questions. No decision. No early stoppage. Father time remains undefeated yet again.  Edit: I should clarify that when I mention father time here I'm not suggesting that volk is done, just that father time seems to outlast the undefeated records of almost everyone who sets foot in that octagon.
Skipped Ian like breakfast this morning🤣
Ian is delusional
Conor snaked the ufc stfu.
Confidence is key🌹🕺🐂
Toronto Card did suck Thaanks for saying that Dana. Always keeping it real...🎉🎉🎉
Robert & Costa deserve the damn bonus
Volks Chin is done.
Everybody CRY
These press conferences are so cringe... the MMA press are mostly sycophants desperate for Danas approval. If anyone tris to ask any kind of tough question Dana just shuts them down. He is essentially an old-skool mob boss of the MMA world.
I wanna see illia move up and fight Islam
Done.
299s gonna be lit. That main  card alone
please stop giving John Generic Morgan first questions
I don’t see Holloway being able to deal with ilia’s knock out power or wrestling. I don’t see anybody in the division with the same combination of skill, speed and power and he proved with that kick that he took that his chin is insane.
Whittaker vs Costa should be the Fight of the night !
Timestamps: 0:01 Dana 30:23 Merab Dvalishvili  44:07 Ian Garry 1:01:23 Whittaker 1:11:53 Volkanovski 1:29:28 Ilia

What a shame Costa/ Whittaker wasn’t the fight of the night.
That translator is the worst person to translate
Topuria🌹
Man, Merab speaking with true humility.  “I cannot even speak loudly about this”   Love it.   Let the actions talk.
This guy's was number 3 got a shot now sounds like he don't want to fight a rematch a umber 1 a number 2 or a number 3 he wants a new younger fight someone who hasn't climb the ladder sounds sort of scared he should rematch then # 1 then #2 then # 3 the way I understand he hasn't fought any of them be a champion fight any fucking one no matter what after all at # 3 he could have been passed up.remember that young man and be a man take.your glasses off like v man he's not a champ yet looked like his eyes was beat down before the lucky punch anyway these clowns are funny loke McGregor he's better than the people he came before hell the Diaz guys was better hell cowboy was better tell him to fight as many. You throw v man out Dana your fucked
Holloway is going to get utterly destroyed by Gaethje. Anyone that cares about him should let him know...

I started the very first BOBBY chant!!!!! It was fucking LITTTT. LETS FUCKING GO BOBBY
massive respect for the greatest Volk!!🇦🇺
Ilia Topuria & Merab Dvalishvili are two fighters that live to their nicknames
anyone else skip Garry ?
How was Rob vs Paulo not fight of the night?..
We need thumbnails for each interview.
How do you qulify for the sport intereviewer in here? Half the questions are chatgpt generic shit.
Ilia has the same dumb arrogance that these young champions have. He thinks that he makes the calls on who he fights. That next meeting is going to be a rude awakening come Tuesday .
Costa Whittaker was FOTN Uncle Dana
Viva Espana 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸 As a Spaniard....as  soon as Spain is announced, I'm flying out!!!
So just to clarify does Volk want the rematch or not?

props to leon even though im not a fan and props to ufc for not making belal one of the 3 options hahaha
who else was underwhelmed by 300 announcements? Big pereira fan, but… “lose your mind when you hear it” is not it
Shoutout everyone who was at the Honda Center WHAT A UFC 298
Another hype train derailed 😂😂
Never trust a man that says no to a steak... Ian garry thanks for confirming my beliefs 😐
Zuk is just another John Dupont
Why didn't hernandez get an interview dude is a beast
Didn’t even pay attention to To’p-   I like his last two I actually which I actually watched- but for him not giving VoLk a rematch crazy- like sayn BoneZ jones fight 9yrs clear everybody lose one match then the new opponent talkn I gotta move on🤔🤔
I'll never understand the immediate rematch thing. imo if you lose, you should go down the ranking and work your way back up. you were a champ, and you lost. what you earned is the title, pay, and opportunities you had while you were champ—not a rematch.
Leg kick bonus goes to...
Ian don't care what people say about his wife, yet wants to sue Sean strickland for insulting him about his wife.
I wanna see them hold the show in my country once. They're gonna hate it soo much😂
Take a shot everytime John Morgan says "obviously"
The top fighters in the division don't make sense to illa. Illa doesn't want to fight anyone in the top 5.
Wow these media guys are idiots 😢
Volk is 100% a class act. I hope he gets his rematch. He's stepped in for the UFC. Let's hope they step up for him.
Garry looks like a used car salesman
Ian Garry is not going anywhere based on this performance. Definitely not a dominant fighter
Was very ready to dislike Ian Garry but that was such a good pres conference. Dude even says he doesnt wanna rush a title fight, just to prove the haters wrong that it wasnt forced. Huge respect.
Garry came off well there in his press conference. He’s back in my good books now. Nice to see him protecting his family.
1:12:22 volk is concussed. Thats brain glitches
I hope Conor never comes back. We got another Conor in Illa
OMG what’s up with these stupid questions from the media. They suck !
Dana "could care less"   yo Dana you're saying it wrong still
crazy that volk and izzy are best buds but volk is extremely humble and makes no excuses and izzy is the complete opposite lmao
Amazing from Dana to push back on that scummy journo at around 15:50
Rob should get a bonus for just being such a down to earth honest & respectful G! Obvs also a class fight too
All these millions of $$$ can seem to be able to pay for a decent f**** audio on these pressers!
I hate when a champ is on a dominant undefeated streak, that it bwcomws his main identity. Then whe he finally loses, he loaes bad and goes on a bad loaing streak....from his own demise. Alwx is great but dude go chill out and get mentally, physically and wmptionally well. Too soon man too soon. Ian Garry gettin decisions wins on gagekeepers = lackluster. Can we get a Rob/Khamzhat  or Paulo/Khanzhat next? Rob and Paulo are fuckin monumetnal. And can Henry Cejudo finally go away?😂
at 14:08 he asked if they were done with him. I looked at the slider on this video and i was like hell tf no their not lol!
Huge volk fan from Australia but you really gotta give it to Ilia, man left no questions. No decision. No early stoppage. Father time remains undefeated yet again.
"You guys saw me fight Petr. You guys saw Sean fight Petr. A lot of people think Sean lost that fight. Anyone think I lost?"
Huge volk fan from Australia but you really gotta give it to Ilia, man left no questions. No decision. No early stoppage. Father time remains undefeated yet again.
What a spectacular night of fights! Huge respect to all the fighters for leaving it all in the Octagon
When Dana White says...this was not about the money. This was a 100% about the
So glad volk and that lizard rat Zuckerberg lost 😂😂😂
Get Khamzat at 300.
UFC 300 DO A SPARTAN THEME - WARRIORS ONLY FIGHT CARD  TAGLINE : SPARTANS!!!WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION????
Volk: rematch yea. I want it. That rematch I need. I don’t ask a lot, just rematch. Need that rematch. So yea… rematch. Spain and rematch want.
Max Holloway is regretting his contract to fight Gaethje. Max can literally fight the Georgian Champion Ilia Topuria at ufc 300 in April for the belt.
"I just mind my own business, keep to myself, and try to put on exciting fights for everybody" - this is why I fux w/ the Reaper.
Big family, beautiful gf, big following, champ of the world.  Good for him.  It's bittersweet as many of us are Volk fans as well, but I gotta give Topuria his props, what a ko.
Y’all still listening to this clown 🤡 ?  Dana White is a criminal
why does Dana even come out for these conferences anymore, if all he's going to do is ridicule questions and give answers like he doesn't want to be there? I doubt he has any obligation to do so
Whittaker vs Costa should be the Fight of the night !
Only 2 seconds in, but how the hell did Rob and Costa not get FOTN?...
Volk is the greatest
Merab and Robert are the fucken best interviewees
Connor vs 2 pac will be an amazing fight
This was a very dark day in the MMA world. the featherweight future looks bleak.
Ian vs Colby should happen
Max fan here..... Volk is such a G
Costa is talking more than his fighting
Volk said Rematch 10000000000 billion times 😂
Wait until he finds out about taxes in Spain
Dana can I go to Spain too?
Illia already picking his fights, something Volk never did.
Volk needs to take 10 man. He's badass with nothing to prove, go heal first then rematch.
I can't believe Dana had a problem with Merab refusing to fight his friend and training partner. This is a line you don't cross. Disgusting to hear this from Dana.
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
The way Ian tries to compare himself to McGregor is crazy
Max Holloway is regretting his contract to fight Gaethje. Max can literally fight the Georgian Champion Ilia Topuria at ufc 300 in April for the belt.
Did that dumb ass really ask if volkanovski is deserving of a rematch? How long has he held the belt? How many title defenses did he have? Look what he did to Max in the the 3rd fight and I consider Max to be one of the greatest of all time.
Anyone shitting on Alex vs Jahmal is a fucking casual who should fuck off back to watching WWE
Merab man u are legend ❤
Dana shouting out Leon is real f
Volk needs to take some time off. Rest up champ, then come take your belt back!
That hat or rats nest hair thing gives me bad dreams.
sick night of brawls
I was looking foward to hearing Henry Cejudo the two time loser explain how great he is,, was,,, lmfao
Lol Cejudo tried to retire again.
Good on the ufc to not give the mic to henry after the fight
Have people forgotten Jose Aldo?
Man , what a run Volk had.. took on ALL COMERS. Respect to Topuria , he called 1st or 2nd round KO & got it done.
Was at the event last night, great time, however no arena should ever charge $21.00 plus tip for a single can of Mich Ultra.
I’m not the biggest Volk fan but this man is the fw goat, was a dominant long raining champ, stepped up on short notice to save the cars against Islam and was willing to save the ufc 300 main event if he came through unscathed and Dana can’t commit to giving him a rematch? But can commit for guys like Izzy straight after the fight. Volk better get thst rematch!
Costa/Whitteker FOTN, not mad about Dern/Lemos getting some extra too, but thats not the FOTN.
I hated Ian when he joined the UFC. He’s slowly winning my respect the last few months
Putting a tattoo of your gf,bf,partner, or lover on your body is a No No for me. People do change!
Asking how many seats is the Santiago Bernabue like hes expecting 5000 seats 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂 That stadium is one of the biggest in Europe
Rip to those who said volk will humble ilia So belt snatching is undefeated now?
These losers asking so many questions about Zuckerburg need their press pass removed, no real MMA fan cares about that rubbish
Volk got his a$$ kicked twiced, only progress is that this time it was much brutal.
Not giving Merab performance of the night is a robbery
Feel bad for Volk, clearly he doesn't understand the effects of getting shut off. You need at minimum 6 months, probably a year, to recover.  And every time you get KO'd, your chin gets weaker. It has nothing to do with toughness, it's your brain firing to your CNS and telling you to shut off earlier to avoid more damage. He really needs to read up on this stuff and realize he needs to take more time between fights. He doesn't get it cuz he had never been KO'd before last fight and he never really KO'd any of his opponents either. Max got 3 title shots but he was never even hurt in any fight, let alone KO'd clean.
Alex Pereira vs. Jamahal Hill as ufc 300 main event both good fighter but thats more a co main event when you think about 300 consider as historic was expecting Dana n his team to do better than that
1 hour and a half till you let the champion talk mf
Even if he's been great at FW i dont think Volk should get an rematch directly. He's lost three fights in 1 year and needs to take a break maybe because he got KO:ed two times. I really want to see Yair Rodriguez vs Ilia Topuria in Topurias first defence. Max is also a name now when Volk is gone as the title-holder but he got a fight against Gaethje for 5 rounds and im worried for him. Lets see how i plays out.
Ilya, you are a wolf. I was 100% sure of your victory. Good luck in the future
Dont forget least amount of strikes landed at middleweight
Usman & Volk are the two greatest examples of being great champions and going out on your shield.
Ian is torture to listen to. Not a single likable thing about him
Costa Whittaker was FOTN Uncle Dana
It's the fights that go the distance and have you on the edge of your seat they should get the bonuses. We don't get our money's worth with sudden KOs. Of course the KOs should get bonuses too. But let's give some love to the most exciting fights as well!
Love hearing Dana slobber up Leon!! Long overdue
Rob vs Costa was definitely fight of night but I think Dana loves those scrambles and BJJ of dern  that he did give bonus to absolute war.
It bugs me when people say world champion.
great to see volk still in high spirits. cant wait for the rematch! ♥
Whittaker vs Costa should be the Fight of the night !
Imagine being the featherweight goat, winning the first round, getting caught with a punch in the second round and ko’d then not getting a rematch if you wanted one.  UFC smh.
Volk is one of the best ever and this does not change that one little bit ! Hes always game , technical , willing to take chances , and held the title for a long time.  Congrats to the new champ he showed alot of poise and got it done.  The remach is deserved , lets go !
Ian Gary is a great fighter, very high iq, nice guy. every1 hating gotta be jealousy or bitterness.  🤷‍♂i feel 4 yall
end of an era
alex "he caught me" volkonosvky
Merab not getting a performance bonus is ridiculous
Illia not losing
Dana quite the funny guy this conference lol
Love that you can skip the ian garry portion of this
Ila is nicely saying he has no intentions of being active
Leon sucks still
Feel like shit just want the pleasure man.
1:35:57 cold
Topuria's sick, he's an awesome fighter, I like him...but he doesn't particularly want to rematch Volk, says he won't fight Max, Ortega, or Yair ..and says Evloev isn't worthy...so who does he expect to fight: #10-15 guys?? 😂
Volk and his team came with the wrong strategy
If Aldo couldn't get a rematch forget about it
Volk made a huge mistake going square with his feet then got clipped . I'm honestly shocked he made that big of a mistake in a fight like this .....
Dana white is the most genuine, humble guy I’ve ever had the pleasure to listen to.  Absolute legend keep the big fights coming💪
1:38:58 this reporter throwing Ilia land mines
The takeaway: Dana doesn't know what "listless" means.
Rob vs Costa was fight of the night.
I think volk is done like usman. Izzy is different though he’s more female so his career can last lil longer
Costa / Whitaker was the best fight for me
The Neal v Garry fight DID NOT suck. Using the fans reaction to judge if a fight is good or not isn't really a great measuring stick. Most fans of MMA are dumb and still have the "just bleed" mentality, they are a bunch of dummies.  P.s, that wasnt Monster in Dana's cup lol
bro itys sad to see this is as far as he gets theres no way he can withstand high caliber wrestling
Main event and co-main were both fantastic. Huge respect to all four fighters for actually fighting (meaning wanting to win) All four fought like warriors
They need have an event in an ancient colosseum
1:36:29 great quote
Was always neutral on Ian but after what he said about covington im a fan! Go Ian destroy this guy
299>300
The script is set Topuria beat Volk now O'malley beats Cheto and Sterling beats Katrer then O'malley goes up beats Topuria then O'malley vs Sterling rematch.
Dawg like how in the hell was that Derns fight fight of the night over Costa vs Whittaker. Dana turning into Vince Mcmhaon
dana coping about Ian being a fanny
FotN is a joke. One of the worst fights on the card. Dern should be on the prelims or gone.
Even tho we don’t like Ian. The guy is crispyyyyy with hes striking
This was a hell of a card, good show gentlemen!  Cheers boys 🍻
Am I the only one that realizes Dana braggs about charging fans more money after every fight and people cheer for it? Like wtf bro, how bout do less at the gate 😂
Dana white is the kingpin of this world in all the good way.
Topuria is DANGEROUS!
Worried seeing that volk interview. Hes clearly not gonna let this go and he will finally see what being a company man does when the shoes on the other foot. They wont give the rematch. They dangled him with islam twice and now after topuriia the stock isnt the same for them. Adding the mental health and breakdown/ heavy drinking he admitted. He cant let fightibg go ane its clear. He said himself if he isnt in camp he feels lost. Dana would have made it clear for a rematch for being a champ that long. I really hope they dont slide him aside like they done with so many others. Hes desvering of the rematch without the 155 fights. This is/was his division.
Alot of money was lost on volk
Lemons and dern was not fight of the night wtf
Ian handling himself much better than in the past.
The Geek reporters and their pointless questions always ruin it for me
So Ilia doesn’t want to fight the previous champs in his division and won’t fight Movsar? Yet he wants to fight Connor, who can barely make 170?!?!?  Lol.  This guy is great, but he seems like another joke of a champ.  I can see him holding up another division, like Leon.
Make Merab fight Sterling!!! We all want to see it !!
Ilia quoting seneca in his interview is oretty amazing. "A sailor without port has no favourable win" yhe translation wasnt perfect but thats pretty cool.
And the main fight on 300 was what?
What happened to usada?
NGANOU VS MICHELLE OBAMA IS THE FIGHT TO MAKE. MY MONEY IS ON BIG MIKE.
I feel like he gonna be here for while
No disrespect to volk but no rematched needed he got knocked out he needs time to get his mind right he got knocked out the fight before this takes a toll on the mental and i know he wants to be active but he'll be another tony if we need feed him to these young guys
Geoff Neal’s performance was disappointing
Boy, Dana danced around that Conor question. They really did Chandler dirty.....
Yah you screwed us in Toronto with that card
1:45 you don’t know yet? You don’t know if the greatest featherweight of all time is deserving of the rematch? What? 🤣
So Belal is a duck and Khamzat/Shavkat prolly couldn’t get here fast enough😂
I almost feel bad for Ian Garry. Dude seems to have a great heart towards his family, but that man married the wrong woman, and he doesn't even have a clue. His head is so far up his WAG wife's ass that he can't even see clearly. That dude may end up permanently broken when he eventually gets blindsided by her.
UFC should be ashamed of the 300 card. They failed the fans and don’t seem to care at all.
Ey Topuria maybe get some title defenses first buddy..Blowing your own bubble to much and  its gonne burst
11:35 Dana start thinking bout them cheeks on Dern
RIP to Alexander "The Great" Garbrandtovski
On the Conor thing. Basically Dana is saying Conor has a lot of money... And he's hiding behind that as the reason why Conor wants to negotiate rather than just agree to fight for whatever low % Dana and the boys want to offer.
who remembers when paddy the pussy talk trash to Ilia 🤣🤣 whis that fight happend
Aldo didn't get a rematch after being ko'ed let's see if Volk does?
Who let the mumbling child get a press pass
If merab and Henry was 5 rounds, merab would have got him out of there. Very sad to see cejudo go like that even with all the bs. Can’t imagine conor being in there like these guys were anymore. Illia has that killer instinct.
What a tricky situation. We all know what Volk has done with that belt around his waist but after getting knocked out back to back Dana did not sound interested about the rematch
Volk should retire.
California fucking sucks. Bring back real live events outside of the apex
Dude is the champ and doesn't want to face the top contenders. . . Is he stupid or scared? He's in for a rude awakening, that ain't how it works dude lol. Can't just win the belt and say "I'm not fighting any of you"
My LEAST favorite question: “Is your Goal CHAMP-CHAMP Status?”  I couldn’t care LESS when a guy wins a belt and IMMEDIATELY talks about CHAMP-CHAMP as a goal.  1st - DOMINATE and clean out the division leaving No questions.  LET the fans call for you to move up.  PLEASE quit with the champ champ questions
And Bobert looked like shite. He would beat Driscuss the gay colonizer.
all i remember from last night is how thick dern is,  🤤
What about Cory ? He was next for the Title 😢 Merab is a beast tho
Who else skipped past Ian muchacha stroking himself on how intlegent he is ?
Where is all hype Dern???? She's another 1 that already needs to quit WMMA
The $50,000 bonus needs an inflation refresh. Maybe 60-65k
I was disappointed by the outcome but I wasn't surprised, Volk is the better fighter in my opinion but Topuria only needed to land one shot and he did. I still don't like this guy but he won fair and square, he's the champion now.
Volkspost fight interview was stellar. Dana and Paulo, not getting their bonuses is a travesty & a very weird thing
Dana up there sipping! Love the Spanish questions thanks for that Topuria
I wanna see ilia vs islam thooo
To be fair that wasn’t a Hail Mary spinning heel kick. Clearly he uses his kicks very effectively
5:55 ,You better take care of Whitaker & Costa! What a classic fight!!
Volk is all class, handles himself like a champion.
Talk about cultured man, German, Georgian, Spaniard, and now Champion 🏆 great job Ilia Topuria.
Volk ya had your chin up on every exit . Thats what left you open every time
Volk needs to take a break even just 6 months. He’s been knocked unconscious twice in a row and that affects the human brain in ways that are not repairable.
Illia is absolutely delusional as hell
HOW THE FUCK DID Rob and Paulo not get fight of the night?!?!?! Also how did rob not get a best performance, that was an incredible come back from a bad head kick.
MaRob doing more socials got them on his side
He wouldn’t have fought 5 or 6 times in the last 12 months lol. I like him but that just doesn’t happen
Every post fight conference they always mention conor, crazy
Not giving Rob and costa fight of the night was crazy. That fight was great
YOU CASUALS DISGUST ME
I hate these immediate rematches. Just because you’ve been a champ for a long time. Topuria won this very decisively. There was no question here. You’re done dude. Work your way up again. If this had been a close split fight. Then I agree. But there was no question here. Every champ that loses wants an immediate rematch. I’m not a fan of that at all.
Leon Edwards is a stud.😂 Wow before he highly overlooked!!!
damn rob beating a juiced out costa shows how good rob is
Volk loses again if his reaction to his performance is “he just caught me” dude was backing up with his hands down and his chin straight towards the ceiling. Massive massive hole in his game.
this was one of those events where there should have been more bonuses given out
Ian garry acting like that fight wasn’t horrible is hilarious lol if he had that tough of a time dealing with Geoff Neal he’s fucked with the rest of the division
I hope to god illa loses his tittle defense and loses everything. Can’t stand that mf
Volk will end up same way as Ferguson the way he's speaking
Haven’t felt a loss like this since Aljo lost to O’Malley, damn
I love this sport!!!
The fact that Volk says im sorry and puts down the 🎤 shows his character.  You dont have shit to apologize for. You can walk away tomorrow and your hall of fame. True Champion!
How can you NOT like Volk?
I love Dana and his answers. Lol, straight up, no bullshit!!
Ian “the cuck” Garry
Dana is the man 🔥
This white Will Smith is delusional. He is planning on destroying Colvington and could not even make a decent fight against Neal
He said he would take care of Costa and Rob so 10- 25,000 in stead of 50,000
I love Volk but that chin is officially cracked. I don't want to see him go out like Chuck Liddell 😢
This card was great except machado and Neal
Another example of the fickle uneducated minds of UFC fans. 24 hours ago everyone was claiming Ilia is fake, and a conor mcgregor impersonator. Claiming he wasn't good at fighting and had only fought buks, claiming Volk was going to embarrass and humble him.  😂😂😂now all of a sudden you ALL change your minds? Like seriously, every single one of you is just going to pretend that you never insulted him 24 hours ago? 😂😂😂😂casuals as usual
I have so many mixed emotions around this event.  Equally happy for Ilia as I’m sad for Volk same Garry/Neal and Whittaker/Costa
Bro don’t even think about going to 155. Islam wil MAUL you..
Bulk should have never been fighting for at least up to 6 to 8 months after he got knocked out in a bigger weight class poor guy tries so hard when he loses the hope to see see him a champ again
Dana is cool as fck tho.
5:55 what a dope boss 🔥
Everyone complaining about costa and wit not getting the bonus, yet this bald eagle proclaims every record shattered every event held almost as if he just keeps raising ticket prices or something......fact is 50k bonus is wack, having only 1"fight of the night bonus" is also wack, plenty of cards that have more than 1 banger who deserve that 50k that's really just 26k. Bonuses should be 200k  minimum for main even fighters and 50k can remain for prelim warriors making a name.
Volk will have my respect until the end of time
17:34
Ian talking reckless gonna catch up w him. Of course he's calling out colby whose 10 years older😂Ian training w maia but look what colby did to him😂
Dana " What Do You Mean " White
Costa won that he was moving forward more, landed more punches, and landed the nicest spinning heel kick ever seen. Whittaker barely didn’t anything
Ian seems like a positive dude. Fans should give this young man a chance.
The way Alex said sorry in the end 😭 I'm not crying
Omalley is nervous.
Max has nothing to offer Illia other than legacy
D on the Ohio ❄️👀
VOLK LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO 😢😢😢...KUDOS HOLDING THAT IN.
bro hates Paulo
The truck started the same way Dana!
Ian Garry is a beast.
There you have it. “Itll be in Spain but who he faces, we don’t know” Volk ain’t getting no rematch. End of the volk era.
Volk is the MAN
Volk may be deserving a rematch for all he’s done at featherweight, but that wasn’t a fluke from Ilia. Watching that fight, it looked like it was only a matter of time before he found his chin, and if they did a rematch, it’s going to happen again. Not to mention, the chin is clearly vulnerable now. Ilia should be a very long reigning champ as long as he maintains his work ethic and stays healthy.
Too bad Volk got caught up against the fence. The fight was just beginning to get hot.
so after all volk has done. he cant even get a shoutout from dana regarding a rematch? Go fuck yourself dana
Volk did look a bit off before the fight, but it is what it is. I don't think it's time necessarily (retirement), but look... coming off two brutal KO's at the age of 35 going on 36 - not easy to climb back from and expect to win at the highest level. Somethin to think about.
how the fuck isn't Costa vs Bobby Knuckles fight of the night thats a robbery
Topouria is obviously a dangerous killer athlete..the only man who can match him will be mcgregor,mcgregor is knockout master illia will know the danger it will bring if they fight it wont just be the biggest cash day but it will be technically class and i just think illia will be over stepping leveles
I want to see Whitaker vs Paolo II.  That was a great battle.  They deserved the bonuses.   Give the Spanish translator a bonus as well.  The translations were  on point and perfect.
ISLAM VS ILIA WE NEED IT
Belt and soul snatcher
Huge respect to Volk, knew illa would win but Volk didn’t deserve to go out like that. Showed such class
Volk needs to focus on recovery.
Cancel Justin v Max, let's see blessed vs Ilia
What a night, UFC always deliver
Literally skipped Ian Garrys part. Then realised I find him annoying like everyone else lol.
He says new challengers but he never fought max never fought yair or ortega sorry my guy but it doesnt work like that congrats champ volk fought those guys just cause you beat volk doesnt mean you beat those guys
The young Irish kid is very educated in the game 🥋🥋🥋🥋💯💯✌️
Volk's too proud to admit his jaw is now made of glass is just sad. Maybe a year or two ago he could have taken that punch and not have his lights turned out. Not anymore.
imagine becoming a MMA reporter to ask the same questions about conor mcgregor every event years after his prime. jesus christ move on..
WE WANT LEON VS ZUCKERBERG!!!❤
Where the fuck are all the ilia haters?
Take your stupid glasses off
Amount of ads is insane
Ian’s want to beat Colby will make him likeable. Everyone don’t like Colby. And we don’t like him so much. We don’t waste a hate on him. I want to see Garry beat the whole crap outta Colby
No bonus for Costa and Rob. Pathetic. What a pathetic company.
These guys getting their jocks wet over that shady thieving weasel zuckerberg crack me up.  I'm a volk guy, but actually kind of glad he lost having that dipstick in his corner and walking him out. Same with Hunter blabbing away to him the whole card all excited he's sitting next to him and that lovely wife like a little fan boy.
Why is the audio always so bad for these post fight press conferences?  CMON AUDIO CREW, YOU WORK FOR THE UFC.  DO BETTER
I skip every John Morgan question
ufc pushing so hard about ilia being spanish lemme tell ya the dude is georgian born in germany poeple dont give a fuck about him in spain people act like hes some kind of conor mcgregor for spain lmao
Fight of the night Lemos - Dern are you shitting me?
Ian Gary is a smart fighter
Ian "The Truth Is' Machado Garry. How many times in one interview can he say the truth is?
Dana is very sarcastic in his old age 😂😂
What Joe Rogan, Michael Bisping and Jon Anik failed to see and to point out, was that Volkanovski kept circling in the wrong direction. On the entire fight Volkanovski kept moving into Ilia's strong right hand. You supposed to move away from the opponents strong hand. This is why when they got close, Volkanovski tried to escape into Ilia strong right hand. And Ilia torqued his ass with a straight right hand down the pipe. Volkanovski moved in the wrong direction the entire fight. It was just a matter of time.
barrlow didn't win? he got a finish
30:19 Merab wearing a Sean O'Malley wig ? LOL
Belal is the 170lb Aljo - gets zero respect from the UFC
I had a 12 person parlay and all I needed was volk to win it. So I was devastated by his loss, I still won a separate bet for KO from ilia but did pay nearly what the 12 person parlay would have every 1$ got me 100$ return!! I was so close!
Ian Garry is delusional
No immediate rematches, let the division move on
Gary trying to explain why he thinks he won a the fight didn’t suck ass…. Kid you ran and got beat up! You didn’t win that fight! You’re a goof at best!
Volk needs to get to wrestling for the rematch
Volk always without that humbleness…it’s not a catch bro. He did you well
Well Dana, GSP looked amazing after a long pause 😉
No cejudo interview? Lol
Much respect to Volk for coming out for this press conference.  Man of character   Immediate rematch💪💪
Ian Garry said he’s got the longest active welterweight win streak when Leon and Belal both have more
Bring back Umar!!!
26:44 pray for Chandler 😂😂
I thought Costa should have won it was so close and he did most damage and was the closest to stopping the fight
N yall thought ilia was delusional 😂😂 n new!
they need to stop giving rematches for champs in fights that ended with FINISHES!  Rematch is for controversial judges decisions.  These days it seems like you've got to beat the champ 2x to actually have the belt.
Connor McGregor questions are so stupid. Connor will never fight again boys
Garry will be a UFC Champion, i do try to like him but he is a bit much. He is defo top level
Illia wants a new challenger? I hope they match him with Zabit
Max is ranked he should fight for the belt next
Who are the 3 who said no to Leon? Islam, Khamzat and who?
Love how Dana is always straight to the point, shits on the reporters if they are shit, and just really says what he thinks  Still needs to be oiled up tho
Why is leon getting thrown 3 different opponents when we all know who is next for that tittle belal he deserve that shit
Lemos And Dern fs loved that fight. Thought Dern won it though.
Clean KO
I love dana white but how does paulo costa and rob whittaker not get a performance of the night bonus? And dana how can't you not answer a simple yes for volkanovski getting an immediate rematch???
If volkanovski doesn't get his immediate rematch that's crazy dana white sounds like he isnt interested in it
Fair play to that reporter asking the hard questions, won’t get another invite back and Dana using straw man logic but respect.
Volk needs to stop fighting at least for  one year, this is his 3rd loss in a row…
Holly shit! he did it! he backed up everything he said. Congrats Ilia Topuria!!
Awful card a lot of boring fights
Ilia real G
Wtf dana how can't you answer if volkanovski deserves a rematch immediately?? He has been the king of the division time and time again defending the belt staying active etc... ofcource he deserves an immediate rematch.
Volkanovski found his alex pereira ☠️
daaaamn who was the three ducking Leon ?😳😳😳😳, Ilia just became a global star wilddddd …. Max/islam/malley… only ones who didn’t like that combination 😮‍💨
We witness the Turning of the tide last night with the Volk fight now it's time for a new featherweight Champion for a while
Ian so cocky man but you legit so ass bro. We have a new decision king 🤣
No way Whittaker and Costa didn’t get fight of the night. They deserve bonuses so trash.
Volk is pure class. true legend. Will never be matched.
After seeing all my favorite fighters get absolutely destroyed last couple years. Beneil, Volk, Bryce Mitchell haha. It’s good to see some new fighters you can like easily. Merab is that dude !
Honestly i dont wanna see a rematch
Main event was amazing!
If Volk can't get a rematch then F*** UFC
Me encanta ver llorar a los gringos
Didn't GSP take years off and came back and won MW against active Bisping?
That Garry is a huge loser and weirdo
I agree with topuria i love the mindset he has and i think he will be a great champion
IAN is the best runner ive seen !!!!
Bobby and costa not getting the fotn is a travesty. I think derm and lemos was great aswell. Come on ufc do better
volk deserves a rematch
Volk 2024
This kid just loves to hear himself talk lol
The gate was over 6 million. The total fighters purses and the performance bonuses was 3.5. The fighters are getting scammed soo bad.
Danas geeked out of his face. Jaw swinging like a Mudd flap 😳
Ian Garry should not be talking after that snooze fest
Congratulations to the great Wanderlei Silva on his Hall of Fame induction!!!
Volk deserves a rematch 100% just give it to him. If he loses again then it is what it is, but if he feels he doesnt need to take time and is ready for an immediate rematch, give it to him.
Sean Penn could play Merab in a film
Did he sign the bonus cheque before the Costa Robert fight?
Man gotta respect Volk. Even when people try to use his come back too early as an excuse he still gives no shits abouf excuses. He is a class act and gave that respect that Topuria deserves.
I love Volk. He’s just an awesome guy.
Ufc 300 sucks no heavyweights come on Dana wtf get the big boys to fight
fight of the night Lemos and Dern!!!???? are you f'in kidding ??? Costa and Whittaker was a f'in banger !! Dana is f'in retarded these days.
Good Card  Sad main event results
Man, gotta love Rob, what a class act dude. An absolute friggin warrior, took that God damn kick like a champ, came back even stronger and won.
I can only qonder ehat wouldve happened if volk never took that islam rematch on short notice......volk seems bent on self destructing atm.....
14:00
20 minutes of microphone wiping
cant wait to see the gary in 10yrs divorced, broke and bitter spilling his guts and crying on some where are they now ufc documentary.
Why was Dana so quick to say adesanya gets a rematch when he has done less than Volk?
if volk doesnt deserve a rematch then no one should ever get a rematch here on out
I was going for volk but i knew ilia was gonna beat him, Topuria had sooooooo much confidence going into this fight he truly believed he was champion. I dont believe volk is done i just think he needs to take a rest recover this is back to back kos respect volk.
I MANIFESTED THIS I MANIFESTED THIS- Ilia “the last stylebender” Topuria
Paddy Pimblett vs Ilia topuria
Paddy Pimblett
Bruh Topuria has the chance to become a gigantic MEGASTAR! Young, confident, good looking, swagger, Undefeated, KO power, speaks 3 languages with Spanish being a major key for all Latin America as well. Sheesh! 😎
Ilia Topuria & Merab Dvalishvili are two fighters that live to their nicknames
Congratulations to El Matador! Amazing discipline, poise, patience, and skill in the octagon tonight. Topuria's confidence was so high heading into the fight that he changed my opinion to voting against Volk, who time and time again has been bet against only to go out and maul his opponents.   Speaking of Volk, he's lost 3 of his last 4 fights and is urgently rushing for a rematch. I think for the sake of his legacy, and more importantly his long term health, he needs to go home, do some serious soul searching, and contemplate his future. Liddell, Anderson Silva, now Cejudo, and of course Tony Ferguson... Too many MMA greats have gone out "the wrong way" and I'd hate to see a standup guy like Volk do the same. I think its premature to say it is the end of an era without a rematch and second victory by Topuria (or even Volk losing to someone else in the division), but it is definitely Ilia's time and I look forward to him trying to clean out the division and etch his name in UFC Featherweight history kust like Volk. New generation!
Dern won
Had to skip through all of Ian Garry tapping his lackluster performance on the back ! Bye
"You can't take 3 years off in a combat sport" -Dana White  He must have forgot the GOAT GSP
Man Dana you know their are going to be at least 2 first round finishes .... That gives you room for one more fight . I know it's being greedy but damn at this point might as well . Let Leon and masvidal finish their story at 300 no tittle on the line unless Leon wants too . You know Jorge will do that fight . He's already itching and idc what anyone says . Jorge Still sells , even after a boring fight . But can we be mad , we knew Jorge vs wrestlers is going to be a snoozer . But Leon vs masvidal , 2 high level strikers , and Jorge not worried bout Leon shooting, Leon ain't going to want to shoot , that's when Jorge is at his best . Damn this fight would be sick
8 decision. Ilia is right. Where he is wrong its saying he do not want to fight Rodriguez, Max or Bryan. For me I think Ortega will be great Match up.
Fight of the night was Dern/lemos? 😂😂😂
Volks such a class act 👌👌
Topuria made it so easy
I don,t understand if Volk realy deserve a rematch he had two chances to take the 155 belt nd now directly a rematch looks like kiwi thing same as Israel Adesanya... rematch... mmm
Никто не разбирался с Волком так легко, я думаю в 145 нет достойных противников для Ильи
Theres ALWAYS someone better out there, its been that way throughout all of history. Its just a matter of time before they showcase thier skills!!
Robbing people who literally shorten their lifetime for this man's profit. This guy is for sure going to hell.
I thought mackenzie  won that fight but she took way too much damage and judges see that. Mackenzie is a warrior but she has to improve her striking. She lunges in all the time and she leaves her hands down leaving herself wide open to shots. She also needs to learn how to jab which is the easiest punch to learn. If she just learned how to jab and kept her hands up and quit lunging at her opponents she would be in contention for a championship.
54:17 IAN YOU'RE A BUM !!
Amanda Lemos won and is nowhere to be found on the channel
You're not getting a rematch we got kO
Great card, ilia is a beast.. but wtf, he’s really calling out Conor McGregor, which is insane. He literally just won the belt seconds ago 😂 boy you better clean out your division, build a name, and the Conor fight is still never happening.
So many fighters have destroyed theyr career by making UFC favours. 😢
That's rich... Ian Machado hating on covington yet he disrespected others with that similar gross mouth as covington.  Someone, please humiliate this douche!!
Don't ever see any broke people join in the walkouts
Toronto was trash you ruined my first experience 😤
😢 you ruined my first ufc fight experience in my life and paid my hard earned money 5 grand. Atlesst your a man and agree it sucked
Main event and co-main were both fantastic. Huge respect to all four fighters for actually fighting (meaning wanting to win) All four fought like warriors
Volk kept asking about spain, and dana mentioned it??  Ya  he womt be cleared anytime too soon.  Poor guy, trying to cement that rematch.
Shout out out 2 the guy pressing dana on the conor stuff and wanderlei quote
You a pick and choose type of business owner . Probably hate Justin tradaeu and made a shit Canada event . Everyone has a great experience!  You ruined my ufc experience Mr. White that ufc toronro is trash.  Why you hate canada ?
💀😂 they ask Dana the dumbest questions
I think the best chemp it is Oliveyra, I wait this moment , in revenge with Mahachev, this is a super fight will be,Volksnovsky is too old for this fight, and revenge not do change in this situation, this is will be replay for every fight , I wait Iliya in 155 this bestest choice for Iliya is a double chemp like a Konor, Topuria vs Mahachev vs Oliveira , I want see
0addy shiting his pant
Ian Garry is absolutely great. He knows who he is, knows his wife (and loves her), happy AF but polite as hell to the reporters (“sorry for interrupting”, thanking each reporter). Love life, ignore the haters. Love it.
Paulo got Rob
Well since topuria says he doesn't seem to have a fighters at his division is good enough...and calling out connor in any weights. Perhaps he should fight Islam next... That will be a good fight indeed...
Dana was on form today 😂😂
Rob got robbed.
To say Alex tore through a division faster than izzy in 2 different weight classes is ridiculous. Izzy paved the fast track FOR Alex lmfaoooo he had the easiest climb to 2 title fights of all time
Garry's a good man, we should stop hating
Dana white said football is the worthless sports in the world. Now Santiago Bernabeu is the great idea🎉
Топурия был какой то уставший в этих очках, года радость Илья, давай поживее радуйся, ты стал чемпом
“What do you have in that cup there?” Dana’s cup: 👀 Dana: uhhh Dana: an energy drink… a MONSTER
Ian Gary has that Mic so close to that lip so we don't see the new oompa loompa
Ian DUMBO Garry
Ilia could beat Islam. That would be a great fight. In featherweight no one can touch him now...
Lemos and dern but not paulo and Whittaker? Ok.
Thank God he admitted he gave Toronto a bad boring card. You owe us a banger Dana
Dana white try’s so hard to control the narrative and if you press him about questions he doesn’t wanna answer you lose your press credentials lol. He’s a joke man
Volk is done. Good run. 🎉
Rematch at bernabeu
300 isn’t it
Dalvishmilibobbiebrown
Ufc 5 curse is real
The questions the dude ask.. WTF these guys ask the fucken lamest questions.  Here's one.. How stupid are YOU? Fire those fools
A dude who barks and dont deliver - Ilia big mouth Topuria - "ill knock him out in first round"
Ian Garry's performance was lackluster at best. He's one fight away from being a tomato can. I think his next fight should be against Shavkat Rakhmonov.
Some of those reporters is why Dana doesn't want podcasts 😂😂
Volk vs Emmet would be great!
Ilia Topuria great KO. Been a fan of Volks but I don’t think this needs a rematch.
its funny how both Ilia and Volk manifested what they advertised before the fight. Volk played the role of an old man, he actually looked like an old man compared to Topuria.
O'Malley is next champ champ ... Can't wait to see O'Malley no this cook
Throw leon a bonus for saying yes dana 😂
love omalley and chito but lookout for merab he's gonna dominate both of those guys.  and illia topuria is gonna be hard to beat.  the evolution of the sport never stops.
That wasnt monster  drink Dana 😂😂😂😂
I hate that Dana says "we'll give them something" when asked about bonuses for paulo and whittaker. Why would someone asking you be the deciding factor when two of your top end athletes nearly brained each other to line your pockets? This guy is crazy greedy.
i think volks got brain damage how many times did he say rematch
Man wanted volk to maul this kid. But props to ilia, i was not giving him much of a chance but he folded volk up clean. Smh if volk dont get the w IF they give him a rematch this kid might be untouchable for a hot min. Holloway is the only one i feel that stands a mild chance at this point.
Just knowing volk wanted to walk out with a sick communist, glad he got sparked again
Cringe is retired
Good to see Leon get his respect Love to see it
Dana is a sociopath
20:42 why is Conor McGregor‘s name still spoken we are talking a guy that never defended a title doesn’t wanna fight last time he did fight he looked like  like a broken man till he did get broken. What’s the hype? I could care less day ever seen the guy fight again let him live his life.
Everytime Dana says we broke gate records all i can think of is yeah you fuckers keep jacking the price of tickets up.
Dana dont like when someone dont want to be coward and bitch and to fight his best friend..showing what kind of pearson he is
Volk will probably never be the same guy after the Islam fights.  That shit happens in MMA.  U can get old overnight.  He was 25-1 on year ago, FF a year, he is 26-4 with back to back KOs.... and not TKOs, he was put out.  Sucks. Now I wanna see this guy against the other top guys like Max.  Too bad Max fucked himself too cause he has to fight Gaethje first at 155 which is a super risky fight that he's a huge underdog in
Their should be a system where if the Champ loses to the num 1 contender. They should fight the num 2 next.   This means champs are 1 fight away from being champ again and it will keep the division moving
Topuria is not beating Max and he will not beat volkanovski a second time. Volk started to read hes rhytm and land more and more, he just got caught whit a perfect punch, so props to topuria
Machado Garry’s fight put me to sleep , awful boring fight
Enjoyed this card immensely 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That’s why Volkanovski lost!!! Because he walked to the ring with that piece of trash Zuckerberg. Half Android half evil!!!
Good night everyone he said 😂😂
Volk needs to heal up and stop rushing fights. Hope he makes  1 more run at the belt.
Volk's career is over. That knockout was brutal. Come Tuesday Ilia's going to be on the P4P rankings after that performance.
who could listen to topredo man worst accent ever
Volk is a points fighter and Ilya is a knockout fighter😂
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 thinking Volk would win 😂😂😂😂😂
Ian G-Very respectful this guy. Very good with his words. Very nice sir.
Give Volk the rematch
Dana it's Spain!!! It doesn't matter if it's indoor or outdoor, it's sunny and hot whole year!!!!
Asked my old man to put £100 on illa by 2nd rounf KO 10/1 while i was working and he accidentally put it on Volk instead   Now my favourite fighter lost and i 1k down 🙁
i bet volk will never pretend to be asleep again during press conference or he would get his wish, just like he was put to sleep by Topuria
Taking 3 yrs off works out only for GOAT JBJ
@16:25 thank you for admitting it. And yes, we would like another event asap.
Take care of Whitaker & Costa a bonus Dana
Alot of people think that when ilia just wiped his hand down volks face that was incudental my man was framing the sweetspot for the ko punch thats nasty skill and perfection. Bispbing knew it too and said it. Congrats ilia that confidence came from skill and talent he knew he was good enough to do what was previously impossible.
Legend Volk, peoples champ always!
no volk rematch, he got smoked in 2 rounds.  no one would be interested.  have to move on.  o malley is surely next
Man what a knockout! I love volk but every reign has to end sometime, best fw champ ever. Topuria seems like a weird dude. Ego mixed with a little bit of humbleness.. well the fw division is going to be fun to follow in the near future!   Oh and not sure but i think volk wants the rematch 😅
Felicidades a illia y a toda la gente que le apoyo y lo ayudó a conseguir el cinturón. Enhorabuena.
Rob and Paulo no fight bonus????
you cant just say " say what youu want, i still got my hand raised " Ian my guy it doesnt work like that. Your fight was still super trash and you will get beat so bad in time. we all saw the fight and it sucked. know that.
Much respect for volk for doing the post fight interview, a lot of people would’ve ran after a loss like that
"Ill be a cuck with a smile on my face" - Ian Garry
Omalley can retire now
So far Topuria is like the Mcgregor 2 he has talk and talk.. but at this point he has backed it up. His record says it all 17-0 Congratulations to EL MATADOR
Leon getting the respect he deserves finally
Yeah exactly, when you can get costa in to fight, when hes off his cycle
all these dumb questions about connor, can the media please take those connor nuts out of their mouth for once, the guy is old and slow.
TOLD YOU VOLK WAS OVERRATED.
That fight wasn’t even on main card, so annoying.
Ian barely wins and acts like he won in spectacular fashion it was a split decision 😂
Wtf a georgia wannabe Connor is champions, the World is Ending 😂😂
"For those who do not know wich port they are sailing to, no wind is favorable". Nicee Topuria.
Robert and costa deserve a bonus
cejudo got robbed
Dana just told you Conor isn’t coming back with that Henry comment
Ian >>>skip>>>
people were booing shavkhat and geoffs fights till shavkhat got the finish
I honestly believe that if Whittikar showed up like that vs ddp he would of smoked him
Ian the cuck Garry was such a trash fight.
Thank You Illya for that +350 KO
Well done Ilia
Man this is the most heart breaking loss for me in the UFC. I love Volk as a champ and he has been on top of the game for so long. Great example of a human being, father, hard worker. But hey, keep your damn head up champ, will always be a fan of yours. Big fan for life.
Topuria v Volk 2 at the Nou Camp 😮😊
It would probably be his last roll of the dice the rematch anyway
Whittaker looked damaged
He should definitely get the rematch. Lots of others have had that privilege, Izzy for one. Not only that like he's just said he's been a company man. Taking the Islam fight last minute. So show the same kind of respect.
cant take 3 years off and have success??? Tell that GSP you turd
Ahhhhh Give Max title shot‼️‼️‼️😩
99 % of mma internets couch sitters would never say something in fron of Ian, such a good fighter he is
Masvidal would have fought Leon but he decided to go to heavyweight.
Volk dude take rest. U jus got dropped bad. Dont cry for rematch.
I love Whitaker!! Class all the time and he's a fighter! One of my favorites of all time. Hope he can stay healthy and win the title back.
Ufc 300 top 4 fights going to beat tonight's top 4 fights? I don't know if they will or not tonight was crazy good
Well done champ
White is a prideful Godless man.
Eugene/that old guy(coaches) needs to be fired no hate just business. They dont have any answers vs boxers (izzy vs sean) now this. Why was volk circling tempura's right hand... that's boxing 101 NEVER circle to the dominant hand. Then Izzy fighting from the cage (equivalent to boxing from the ropes) vs strickland. Stupid move. Max is Best. Blessed soon to be champ 🤫
His multicultural stuff is dope and doesn’t feel disingenuous. The guy has won me over
He’s clearly afraid of Moslov. He knows his exact record as defense mechanism. You don’t keep up with someone’s record that you aren’t worried about.
O'Malley did not beat peter yan.  No way ! He won 1 round only
WHERE ARE ALL OF VOLKS FANS, he was put to sleep hahahahahha
Ians wife’s favorite restaurant is 5 guys ! Ian: my grandmother didnt give me any love, so i went and married one !
How can you not love Dana, stop being haters people, Dana is a gold mine!
Lo dijo, lo hizo. 🥋🥊🇪🇦🇬🇪
Still love Volk. Topuria is very dangerous. Massive rematch. Volk will be more determined and focused than ever
Damn we sacrificed volk to get a Jamal Hill fight 💀☠️…
As soon i saw whittakers walkout i saw the reaper in him what. Fight ❤ good card
"The current longest active win streak in the welterweight" ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? idiot.
Merab vs Sean is going to be wig vs wig 😂 Can’t wait for that fight. Conor isn’t fighting Chandler before media events for that movie because if he loses it’s going to take away from his stardom in Hollywood. After the release then hopefully Conor will grace the UFC fans with his presence and fight Michael Chandler. Everyone and his grandmother wants to see that fight! It’s sold out before it’s even announced where and how much the ticket price is.  Topuria did what he said he would do and did it convincingly. Rematch inSpain at a soccer arena would be wild 🍿💪
Pay your fighters more. Maybe 300 would have a legacy main event if you'd break the bank a bit.
The people are right - Ian “corno” Garry is that cringe ! 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
I know I’m not the only one but when I heard he was going to defend his belt after that brutal knockout. All the unprotected hammer hits to the top of the head from Islam was just way to soon of a turnaround. I had a really big feeling this would happen to him. Not to take anything away from ilia but that hit would’ve never took volk down had he taken at least 9 months off from that knockout. No sparing no training. And now I don’t think volks brain will let him get hit again without automatically just shutting down. 😢this sport is brutal and you have to respect it. When it tells you to take a break, take a break.
Yo Dana was coked out during this conference lmao
If that frijole doesn't fight Max Halloway, he's scared AF.
It's clear Volk has nothing to hold on to except for his past achievements.His anxiety is obvious.Illia is the better fighter and he knows it.If he thinks he stands a  chance against Topuora in Spain hes delusional.
It's clear Volk has nothing to hold on to except for his past achievements.His anxiety is obvious.Illia is the better fighter and he knows it.If he thinks he stands a  chance against Topuora in Spain hes delusional.
IMpressive Volk.
Topuria really is cocky. His champ status will be short lived.
If page beats holland Gary and page would be incredible
Rob vs costs was fight of the night
Max wwnts tupuria asap
The sugar show is about to come to a hard stop.
I like Dana's interviews , he is blunt and will call out a stupid question to there face.
I think volk was an early stoppage.  He was just playing possum - for quite a while.
I hope Ilia stays hungry 💪
Dana Called him Mike Zuckerberg
Strickland fans be like, Costa won because look at Rob's face 😂
Every event is the highest grossing it seems
Ask sneako about what fights are like
Garry is such an impressive man and yet also such a feeble man.  Interesting to see the contradictions in the dude.
Dana would give 50k to Bob Menery yet Costa and Rob get nothing
UFC should be more careful who they rub shoulders with It's shameful that SUCKERBERG the WEF Globalist is riding the coat-tails of MMA he's a Planet Enemy
There’s never been a champion that deserves an immediate rematch than volk. Happy for ilia though and glad whittakers back in title contention
How can Dana say Robs absolutely going to fight for belt but yet say he doesn't know about VOLK? WTF
Everybody noticed that Ilia called out Conor instead of Islam? 😂 Kittykat.
UFC 300 main event very underwhelming
merab the decision dvalishvili. absolute 🗑️
300 is not the card Dana hyped it to be really dropped the ball 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scrap the fight with Justin and put Max vs Illia!
Belal vs leon literally does 3 ppvs
Ilia already trying to avoid a rematch 😅
Leon kicked in the nuts again.
Ian is gay
Respect to Ian Garry, before this i was neither here nor there with him, but after this and how he's dealt with the hate a BS comments, at his age? Im a fan. GOOD ON HIM.
Does Ian garry not follow his own division…. He said he had the longest active win streak in his division…. Shavkat? Belal?…. Shavkat eats Garry alive
Aldo 7 tittle defences volk 5 tittle defences
"You can't take 3 years off in a combat sport...."  Meanwhile an uninjured Stipe 'DuckDuck' Miocic hasn't fought anyone in 3 years and is getting a title shot.   Not too mention he hasn't fought ANY of the currently ranked top 15.  smh
🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪
Let’s go Georgia 🇬🇪
🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪👑
How is Whittaker and Costa not FOTN?
Proper 12 whiskey in Dana’s cup for sure
Topuria a very good example that one should be proud of one's origins. Speaks Georgian and Spanish   Volkanovski a Macedonian who was born in Australia but doesn't speak Macedonian ans doesn't speak Greek Why is he ashamed to walk in with a Macedonian or Greek flag?
Ian Vs Neal was the MOST HORRIFIC AND BORING fight on the main card! He would try to shake hands after every strike. Yuck
Volk wins the rematch
If you're really high and start looking at Volks head, it just gets weirder and weirder
Merab brown nosing Zuckerberg is cringey
Ian Garry answering questions he wasn’t asked hahah
Mystic Topuria
Who were the 3 potential Leon's opponents who turned down the 300 lol
Come on Madrid. I will be the first to sink my hard earned cash into the event with VIP seats!
🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪❤️✨ Proud of you guys!!!
It's amazing how quickly people write off some of the most dominant fighters in history, the SECOND they lose a single fight (even if it's against top competition). "It's the end of an era... he's old now"... Most of the UFC's champions AND top contenders are in their mid to late 30s... Hell, this is even the case in boxing, where endurance plays an even bigger role. Most of the champions there are mid-late 30s, with some of the best contenders even being 40. Volk still beats 99% of the best and 'youngest' fighters - he just happened to lose to Topuria, who's a nightmare for anyone (evidenced by the fact he's unbeaten ffs).
Volk  Full of excuses, retire!!!!!
Merab the only bearded Tina Turner tribute act.
10:28 I want to know what happened to those three opponents. They all say no and if so, why
booooooo dana booooooooo
Until the power goes out , this is meaningless
We have to do Holloway/Topuria next or Ortega
Some of these questions 🤣🤣🤣 "What do you think of someone else thinking something?" WTF Good on Dana for just saying "WTF are you asking me???"
illia gonna run from max for all of eternity <3 hawaii <3
Jesus is great topuria. You have motivated me beyond understanding
IMG talking Cali: "It's got the beach, it's got the green...." Somebody in the background: *cough cough* 😅
Fighters sacrificing blood sweat and tears and translators still cant translate right to save their lifes😭😭😭🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Wow Topuria is arrogant.! Lucky he can fight because he loves to disrespect other fighters.
299s gonna be lit. That main  card alone 🔥🔥🔥
Volk is FINISHED.  Feather weight GOAT. Ride away brother and enjoy your retirement .These KO's at this age are unforgiving.
I have seen enough. Topuria is the goat
45:14 like your wife😮😂
Us brits don’t turn fights down I thought you learnt that from Michael Bisping 😂
I love Ilia. I am so happy he is champion. But the real Georgian hero tonight was Merab. He was born and bred Gerogian.
Alex Volk looked like a school boy compared to Ilia ‘15-0’ topuria the champ!!
@Ian, you can't blame him when you were fist bumping him all the way through it. Muppet
"You can't take 3 years off in a combat sport".... Close you ears - Conor.
Dana essentially just said Conor’s never fighting again
Topuria with the comment that will win the hearts of ALL Hardcore fans. "My Job is to FIGHT. Whomever they put there. I will be rewdy"
We keep hearing Garry will finish opponents, he rarely does.
Conor doesn’t deserve that fight and that call out was kind of goofy😂topuria a beast though
Dream on!!
7:56 Tell me you’re American without telling me your American. But I guess the new build wasn’t hyped as the Raiders Stadium. Just look it up, Santiago Bernabeu is a thing of beauty with some crazy lawn elevator setup.
Volks Retired maybe !! Topuria vs Holloway 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Okay, I'm officially done hating on Ian Garry. He showed up this time. To the presser, to the fight. His presence in this presser actually seemed genuine. Keep it up then, kid. Leon & Shavkhat await.
Ilia has swagg man,potential new superstar in the sport.Not no stupid ass rainbow dummy oMalley
The EA curse strikes again
Zuckerberg, Trump, Rogan...this sport attracts dickheads.
Leon doesn’t say no to anybody?!  Lol, ok Dana.  I remember him saying no many times to Colby.  Short memory.
Volks chin's gone and Father time is catching up on him too, as much as he denies the fact, it's only going to get worse from this point. He did  look slower a bit just like Colby did  against Leon.
Ol Volk..he saw everything.  Except the punch that put him to sleep.
What happend to fight of the night??????
Yeah, just remember ' The king s dead, long live the king'  Goes for you too Ilyia.
Pooping is awesome
volk went from p4p no 1 and the dude that gives islam the biggest trouble to a guy that should retire just in a span of a few fights.
The card for 300 is good for any other pay per view and don’t get me wrong it’ll be enjoyable but I was a bit disappointed. The main event will be a banger but I was hoping for something bigger
Costa not a scratch... Whittaker looks like he had his head beat with bowling pins for 2 hours... and there was a 27-30 score by one judge? should have been a Draw if not Costa winning... Rob just point fightin cuz he was scared after what happened at the end of the 1st... like Nate Diaz said about when he fought Edwards if that fight was in a parking lot who would have won...
Glad I wasn’t the only one thinking what was in that cup😂
All will be restored win max beats his breaks In
Dana aka fisk was not happy tonight. 😅
Holy illia is so dumb pretty much saying anyone that’s 10-15 you got a title shot
@ufc your thumbnail with new champ spoiled all the fun for me. Wanted to buy ppv in the morning (EU), and first thing i saw in the ufc fight pass app was the thumbnail with Ilia and a belt. Fix that next time please. No point in buying ppv now
Costa got robbed
Dope main card. I thought Roman would outclass Anthony and eventually finish him. Big win for him. Merab manhandling and eventually dominating Henry, Ian being overly nice to Geoff lol, banger between Robert and Paulo, and volk getting knocked out like that was crazy to see. Topuria got to give max a shot. Why wouldn’t you want to beat the best two featherweights of all time and have that on your resume. Not saying max would win but he deserves one more shot at it. it would be tough to see max potentially get knocked out like that he did to volk though.
The fake Olympian got outwrestled againnnnn and couldn’t even score a takedown thought y’all said merab was gon fail takedowns to a decision
15mins of Ian Garry talking shit...fml
God damn. These media guys need to stfu up these stupid rich dudes wanting to fight..
Ilia Makhachev would be cool 👌🏼
How the f… didnt costa or whittaker get a bonus. Thats some bs
Arrogant fucker got the belt now Let's see what kind of champ he will be......
Yair next!
Volk is one of the few guys that appears at the post fight press conference after a loss!
Took me a few minutes to accept and move on. Volk too deserves respect for what he has accomplished so far and nothing can take that away from him. Illia is the new benchmark, props to the new Champ.
Love ilia
The ego comes to Robbie's defence. 😅 bro was in all sorts
Really don't want to like Ian garry son of a bitch ain't making it easy though 😆 😆
ILIA 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🏆🏆🏆
Zuckerberg money shines
Eating meat is extremely healthy for you
*I am very sad that Ilia put old man Volk down for a nap* 😟🙁☹
The press are asking so many dumb questions like wtf is going on.
Ian thinks he’s such a fighter homeboy folded when his wife’s ex husband said “you better take my last name” 😂
I pooped while watching this. ❤
Ilia so scared of Movsar that he is looking to rather fight finished Volk than (Exposing) movsar like he’s talking he knows that’s about it for his belt he’ll lose the belt the next fight Spanish chica fake mcgregor
Grande Topuria, menudo cabronazo
Topuria might've won but he will never be a champion with that pathetic attitude.
Apparently , Conor is still the money-fight for all fighters , despite he is washed out. Is that even a challenge anymore , or is it just the green dollar talking ?
Huge respect to Alexander ,chin and go again champ , love the attitude  so good for the sport  👏👏👏
Cancel justin and max and make max vs ilia and justin vs Islam. Now that would be a legendary 300
1:43:10 dijo papa Giorgio??
Vamos Ilia🇪🇦🇪🇦🇬🇪
Ian "what the truth is" Machado garry seems like hes trying to convince himself everytime he says, "what the truth is" which is pretty often
Volk didn’t give his brain time to heal after the Islam KO because after a recent KO it’s easier to be KOd again because your brain needs a lot of time to heal. Look up the video of big John and Josh Thompson talk about it perfect explanation
How is volk 'the most dominant champ ever' he gets tagged and hurt in majority of his fights.
Volk, what a legend
Gary couldnt be more unlikable. Ask his wife
“If a man knows not to which port he sails,no wind is favorable” Sheesshhhh this man is here to stay . Congrats 🍾 Ilia .I was slightly rooting more for Volk but well deserved.Been following your success . I would like to see you as double champ vs Islam Mackachev. What a BANGER that would be  💯
How could he, i mean, how could Topuria knock the f out of an old man? ;)
Ilia sounding PICKY already...hmm.
Yeah, you could see that Volk was not there even when he walked out.  Looked a bit low-energetic. He talked to his corner before the presentations, he walsed back and forth, talked to Lopez, talked to Bareman, seemed a bit out of sync. He did not have that energy and aura.   First round was ok from Volk, he started the second decent enough, but he just seemed worried ALL the time about being hit. It was just about "i'll land something, no matter how small it is, and don't get hit", and that is not what Volkanovski has been about.  I guess he took the fight waaay to soon, but he is 35, so time is slipping away. Makhachev really put some serious ghosts in Alex's head.   Not interested in a rematch. Like i said when Volk took the Makhachev fight on short notice: He is giving away a bit of his legacy because there is NO way he is going to win. Instead, he got knocked out, lost his FW-belt, is 35, and really, where to go from here?  Topuria wins a rematch 10/10. Volk's greatest strength was fight-IQ and mentality. His mentality was cracked against Makhachev, and when that happens, your fight-IQ is going to be affected by worry and fear of "what can happen".
I think Volk wants a rematch, I could be wrong though
Costa Whittaker was FOTN Uncle Dana
Im from ireland was hoping for ian garry to win but neal had garry got lucky neal didnt go after him
Fighters that we will probably lose in the next year …   End Of A Great Era My UFC Brothers  -Jonny Bones -Adesanya -Justin Gaethje -Dustin Porier -Volk (just got murdered in cold blood) -Wonderboy Thompson -Stipe Miotic -Henry Cejudo -Kamaru Usman
I thought that Geoff Neal won that fight, other than that I thought it was a great card.
The Gong is proud of you Volk ! A wonderful fighter in the ring and a humble absolute gentleman outside the ring.
Now what? From McGregor wannabe to to fucking champ. ARRIBA ESPAÑA
Volk isn’t getting an immediate rematch and that’s bullshit.
paulo costa beat robert whittaker but judges robbed him also this whittaker guy is so washed and over hyped i see nothing he got beat up and wobbled, judges only did what the bookies told them to do before the fights thats why he was favourite ...we know corruption when we see it
Solid performance by Tuporia. But calling out McGregor shows his ambitions. We just got a champion that is going to hold up the division.
I wish Whittaker stops his childish goggles.
everybody saying ufc spain ufc spain, give us ufc tbilisi. it will boost georgias economy while the tourists can have amazing views trips food and wine. book it in the dinamo stadium and 40k viewers booked iut in a very guest friendly cheap country
THE GOJONTI MALA DESERVES A REMATCH
I WANT  REMATCH FOR VOLK..HE DESERVE IT MORE THAN ANYONE,MOST ACTIVE FW CHAMP IN HISTRY. I WANT THIS MF I BELIEVE VOLK CAN PROVE HIMSELF NEXT ACTIVE OTHERWISE ITS GOJONTI MALA
Khamzat vs Whitaker next
The moment he KO'd Alex, I tried to reply a comment on IG written 2 days ago with a lot of upvotes which said "It must be sad being Topuria" and before I could reply the comment was removed. Died laughing🤣🤣🤣Fake fans are something else🤣🤣🤣
29:26 _get inn phoque inn enamoured inn LA_
Whittaker vs Costa should be the Fight of the night !
Volk you will always be my favourite fighter in the UFC and I’m sure for many others.. Keep your head up brother you made us proud for a long time and will continue to ❤ So much class and swagger!!!
Alex “ did Dana say Spain  Volkinovski, 👀massive volk fan but   Needs to chill for a bit I feel
Volks is a class act
I guess all 3 guys for Leon were Belal, Khamzat and Shavkat which means they all rejected due to Ramadan
Dana getting too good at this media shit. 😂😂❤
Much respect to Volk. Such a True Champion and such a Class act 💪🏻
The Zuckerberg curse
I don’t see Holloway being able to deal with ilia’s knock out power or wrestling. I don’t see anybody in the division with the same combination of skill, speed and power and he proved with that kick that he took that his chin is insane.
🇪🇦
fun night. all the complaints are just representative of 80% of ufc fans, which are a bunch of sensitive pussies. Go get a beer and make some friends brotha! :)
Congrats Ilia Topuria very humble & classy in Victory. Volk you are the greatest person & featherweight. Such a great event thankyou UFC
All what Volk had to do is spam the teep kick
How bad is that 300 main ufc brass hates the fans 😂
Sound is miserable
They say “mirab can you get atleast 1 significant strike” dude is so boring
max vs Volk 4 for the title shot
Exciting card. Costa won that fight clearly did significantly more damage ufc must really want to push Whittaker
UFC desperate for Paddy Pimblett & Ian Garry to be liked so any decision is rigged. Both pair of pricks who hopefully will be like Till against a good fighter lose then fade away.
Could see this coming from a mile away
Mirab “ unanimous decision” dvalishvili
Max Holloway Title shot
🐾
It's time for the blessed express to be back on the top. 🎉
❤
@4:25: "no no no this was not about money" LMFAO add this to the list of bullshit that comes out of Dana's mouth. Yea money's definitely not the reason they chose Jamahal Hill to headline the UFC's biggest event ever 🤣🤣🤣how are we supposed to take you seriously? lmao
Volk wants a re match 😆😆 GTFO. Your reign is over brother.
It must be danas time of the month
This clown Ilia is obsessed with Conor. He copied his tattoos, tried copying his personality, tried copying his rise. Then he goes and calls Conor out. Absolute 🤡 move. Zero charisma, all cringe. Sad day for mma boys.
Im on team fkn Leon. I'll NEVER call a fight against him again. End of story. He has asended to Islam level respect in my eyes with that report.
Lobov go n finish ua dad hhhahahahha
Topuria  vs Max
Too bad Volk lost, also because of the ego of Ilia. Graceful of Volk though, he still showed up for the post fight conference and didn't take anything away from Ilia. Looking forward to see the rematch in Spain! Neal was walking Ian down, if he only had done something while doing so, it wouldn't have been a split decision for Ian! It was a bit cringy to see Ian go about it. But it is what it is, for that matter. And Merab is probably going to take the belt soon; awesome performance! Robert and Paulo was as expected, nothing new really. I missed Dana announcing the main event for UFC300 though...
First
Who are the 3 that are to scared to take on Edwards 🤔
Fight of the Night should have been either Dvalishvili vs Cejudo or Whittaker vs Costa
Topuria vs Yair Rodriguez would be a banger, make it happen oily Dana.
The Aussies are good blokes!
Volk needs to take time off , no rematch
Full respect for Volk, recognising Topuria power. Grande Matador 🎉
Huge volk fan from Australia but you really gotta give it to Ilia, man left no questions. No decision. No early stoppage. Father time remains undefeated yet again.  Edit: I should clarify that when I mention father time here I'm not suggesting that volk is done, just that father time seems to outlast the undefeated records of almost everyone who sets foot in that octagon.
Love to see the respect acknowledged for Leon that’s my dawg 😭
Islam KO soften Volk's chin
Who ever asked about Miranda maverick absolute legend 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Microphone cleaner! you don’t rub the knob then the handle, you clean the handle then the knob, ya knob! 🥴🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
Nothing but respect for Illia 💯🙏💯👍
Rob doesn’t deserve another title shot. Lol. Not right now at least
No one has ever Deserved a Rematch more as much as Volk does. Will be an embarrassment from the ufc if they don't give him his rematch
I was hoping for Max to dethrone Volk but this one is really interesting
How did costa and Whittaker not get a bonus
Sent that mam down unda
UFC Spain? Venue in Estadio Santiago Bernabeu Real Madrid LETS GOOOOOO
Yo it's so funny the whole Izzy crew been taking hard L's since they turned vicious ( Lying about Islam taking IVS and everyone jumping on board).
Can't help but feel bad for Sandhagen
Dana giving Leon Edward Respect 💯
Dana loves the sound of his own voice. Boring
Merab 🙌🏽
6:36 bro meant if ilia didn’t go down Connor’s path he will do good
Alex is still the man👏🏾🔥
That ole olé ole song was dope!😆
VIVA 🇪🇸
It was a hard position for Volk because Illia was charging in with them combinations, The closer you can get to your opponent, the closer your tools to the target and the harder it is to react/respond (block, counter, slip). That’s why the basics of striking is not load your shots cause the further it is, the easier to respond to. But in this case, Illia was too close and had his weapons too close to the target to have enough humanly possible reaction time to defend.
🇬🇪 proud of you 🇬🇪
evloev is shuold be next
Bro out of respect for Alex he deserves a rematch and if he loses that then it’s over
UFC never going to South Africa. That place is a 💩 hole.
Wonderboy will beat Ian khamzat will beat him usman will burns will beat him Ian’s a bum fought all bums and volk get the rematch right away
Well all my 33 to 40 year olds our area is ending we seen chuck we seen jones we seen mcgregor now the young guns are taking it to next level amazing to be able to see the level Change
The Topuria era is here. Chill out Volk fans, I feel you. Respect the champ after all the bs shi$ talk all week lol! He did what he said only 2nd round.
Oh my god Ian Garry is UNBEARABLE
El verdadero peligro no es Max. El verdadero peligro para Ilia sera Eloev.
I always thought Cejudo wasn't a great champion.  I thought his fight with DJ could've gone either way. He had a lucky punch against a severely malnourished Dillishaw. Won against Moraes in the beginning of his downward slope. And had an early stoppage against an out of prime Dominick Cruz.   And to see Merab basically toy with him. I dunno man. I don't hate him. But I think his skillset is kinda overblown a little bit.
Topuria had a few drinks backstage before he came to the presser can't even talk lol
Volk was winning one and two volk get a rematch asap just like Izzy got so volk will get that belt back
Topuria was a smart and patiënt fighter! If the fight had gone the distance, I believe it would have been a close one to call,  However Props to Topuria for proving he had not only the power, but the skill to fight and beat a great champion like Volkanovski !!
Topuria against Makhachev......💥
Why yall can't stop crying and admit that Ilia destroyed Volk?
Max will murder this guy
Ian Garry / Neal was the worst fight on the card come on.
After all Dana's talk, UFC 300 co-main  is a WMMA with Yan, who most of us have never even seen fight. BS!!
You gotta love robert whiniker man...so humble so real such a good guy...he handled business out there tonight!!!! Great fight the whole party was crazzyyyy on that fight!  Paul looked like a damn HULK in there an you kept pressing foward keep jamming an ultimately won the fight!!! Nicceee
McGregor vs Topuria at 155 in Spain! UFC will drag all the money out of Europe!
Dana looks like he's playing for the Raiders with those shoulder pads.
When Dana White says...this was not about the money. This was a 100% about the 💰
Nikko from gta4 is finally the champ! Came from stealing cars to being the champ I love gta
Not giving Rob and Paulo bonuses is atrocious
Volk u were a great champion man 💯  But that is back to back brutal KO's! (Particularly this one)..  You're not getting a immediate rematch bro smh..  And u weren't doing nothing to Topuria tonight and i could tell it was a matter of time before he clipped you!  (That weak left body kick he kept throwing was going to get him KTFO anyway)..  Horrible strategy and gameplan idk wtf him/they were thinking with that smh..  It's time to call it a career my guy bc u ain't beating Topuria!! (U can't beat him by point fighting)... And it's really the only way u know how to fight 🤷🏻‍♂️  I love Volks self confidence and hunger and all that!  But he is bordering on Delusional now 💯  Sure, he can keep fighting and is capable of beating alot of guys at 145 still!  But idt he is the kinda guy that just wants to be another fighter...  So IMHO he should hang them up bc he will never be champ again tbh..  Great Career Volk and you were a great champion but the end is here my man 💯  I don't want to see him become the next Tony Ferguson!!!!!  That 💩 is Sad 😢
Volk deserves a break and Max deserves another shot. He's been on a tear. If Gaethje doesn't retire him first
Leon finally getting his props
Let’s see if he is going to to be champ like volk or a champ lie Islam fight twice a year
Early stoppage
Dana definitely not putting volk on for another 1.5yrs
el maatdorrrrrr
Nobody in this division will stop el  matador. Unstoppable ilia
Feed Lilia to Gaethe
1:39:40 The guy asking Topuria what would be a date for Spain is so stupid… Spain got mentioned how would he have a date
Cant wait for Max get knocked out by topuria next
Usman & Volk are the two greatest examples of being great champions and going out on your shield.
Why dana looks a little wired
Alex “he just caught me” Volk
What a shame Costa/ Whittaker wasn’t the fight of the night.
Peolple saying "SaD To SeE VoLK gO OuT LiKe THIs"  Uhmmm  1. He lost two fights to a bigger weighted division chasing greatness   2. He just lost for the first time in YEARS to someone in his division 😂  Like get a grip ya bandwagoners 😂
Why dont anybody talk about potential fight with Makachev? Are they scared?
50k for knocking out the longest lasting win streak in ufc history. This guy needs to be fired.
UFC 300 Main Event just dropped & i'll be the first to say, if Hill's leg is near 100% & he's back healthy, he will KO Poatan in the 1st-2nd rd. Alex's boxing is not like that. His boxing defense is nearly non-existent even after the Izzy KO in which JH has better boxing than Izzy. AP also doesn't move his head often. Pereira is confused when combos are thrown at him especially in the pocket & Hill's bread n butter is that. He often stares or tries to parry to block. Also doesn't have anything off the backfoot aside from a left hook or a 1-2.  Alex has the better striking but Mahal has exceptional striking which can hang with the best of them. JH's boxing is better almost all-around if not all. I guarantee anyone if JH has recovered, he will end things early simply due to the big skill gap in the boxing. He also has one punch KO power to go with it. Some ppl actually don't know that Mahal hits harder than Alex. He also has a better chin than him as well, barely gets hit & never been wobbled even tho he was caught by some bombs by guys like Santos, & Glover.   Mahal's also pretty good everywhere, needa see more of his wrestling tho. Grappling is solid. Alex's grappling is solid as well. There will be no takedowns shot in this fight. JH openly said he wouldn't, & that he will go for the finish & we know how Pereira's coming, just🎆waiting to happen.  Hill is probably the most underrated fighter in the UFC & the most underrated P4P puncher in the sport. There's a reason why they call him "Sweet Dreams", this fight will show that. Injured or not, Hill always game. Came back rlly fast from a severely distorted arm in the Craig fight & became champ.   Y'all will see just how underrated Hill is in this fight on the feet if he's 100% Those who don't know Jamahal, he never has a boring fight & neither does Alex. Both ALWAYS go for the finish. This fight is a CERTIFIED BANGER!   Sweet Dreams vs Poatan 2 of some of the sports hardest hitters, P4P [hence their nicknames] & it's guaranteed to be on the feet. Can't wait for this sh. It will be fun while it lasts.
The WATER BOI is the champion, the one that PADDY the BADDY was going to whoop his asz .. wow that’s crazy .. 🤬👏💪😂
Volk going out sad, just take 1 year off ffs
Evloev Movsar Topuria Let's go Dana Give them a fight🎉.
I'm devastated by Volk's 2nd loss via KO in a row, but I'm ecstatic that Bobby won! Paulo is TOUGH! Rob had Costa's left leg in Fucksville from the first round, and Paulo still hung in there for 2 more while fighting his tits off! Great fight, and great win for our boy Bobby! Volk should never be sorry for losing. You win some, you lose some. That's part of life. I'll always be a fan, and Alexander THE GREAT is still the Featherweight GOAT! Ilia doesn't want any part of Yair!
UFC  300????
Shoutout everyone who was at the Honda Center WHAT A UFC 298
Grande Topuria
This era of handsome Kenny Florian begins now
12:59 what a stupid question 🙄🤦
Volks still a champ look how he holds himself honestly
Volk ❤
Rip to those who said volk will humble ilia😂 So belt snatching is undefeated now?
I love volk but he deserved to get knocked out after walking out with Zuckerberg I hope he doesn’t do that in the rematch
ილია გილოცავ !!! სულ გამარჯვებულმა იარე !!!
islam ended Volks career
Ufc Jason Statham look alike  lol > (Volk)
Henry looked slow and seemed to tire out fast
He should go up to light weight for double champ status, cuz he has the power n skills to achieve it..👍👍👍👏👏💯💯💯
Empieza una nueva era! Viva Topuria y viva 🇪🇦
Bonus still at 50k 😂
Cost and Rob didn’t get FOTN?😮
Arti infonesianya?
No one is talking about how ilia is champion and at one point in time him and paddy where about to fight in a lobby and paddy said he wouldn’t be shit damm crazy out come sad to see volk loose especially when I liked both fighters but was hoping for volk to break more records but latley all my favorites fighters have different stories in there carriers than what I expected
Can we all agree Ian Garry is full of sh*t
Just to echo this from other comments. With the chance, *Max Holloway* will be champion again if he fights this dude. So long as Justin Gathje and him dont fight the 5 rounds i think they will for the BMF title.  Edit: He kills this guys style. Thats why that is mine and alot of others opinion. Love you.
love Volks attitude post fight, two tough losses in a row but still has a smile on his face. I think he should take time off though. Couldn't fathom a third time Volk is knocked on the canvas, my heart wouldn't be able to handle it
Seeing evil Lizard Zuck was annoying . He is a POS
Volk looks locked in, round 2 might look great.
Topuriya+konchita
Only 2 seconds in, but how the hell did Rob and Costa not get FOTN?...
I knew he was gonna ko him. Easy money tonight
We need ufc in spain 100%
Volk definitely deserves a rematch but 2 KO’s in 4 months can't be good. Doesn't change much anyways. It's how the game goes - father time wins and the new generation takes over. Who knows, depending on his reign, Topuria may overtake volk in GOAT conversation some day. We’ll see.
Thats the one thing i never liked bout dana  hes so mean with the money he hates giving anyone the bonus the co main was the fight of the night i think and there the guy that should of got the bonus
Volk always graceful in defeat
Volk wants this rematch bad
Topuria grande entre los grandeees👏👏👏👏👏😎
Was Topuria vs Volk an upset? How would a rematch play out? Thoughts
massive respect for the greatest Volk!!🇦🇺🙏🏻
Volk is not a legend. He never beat someone as good as CCC, Demetrius Johnson, Jon Jones, Cain Velazquez, even someone like Conor McGregor. He was blessed with a weak division. First time he fights good fighters, not even as good as the guys I mentioned & he gets KO’d by both.
Saddest day in Ufc history. Volk loss and that 300 main event just sums it up.
Big family, beautiful gf, big following, champ of the world.  Good for him.  It's bittersweet as many of us are Volk fans as well, but I gotta give Topuria his props, what a ko.
Let’s go Ilia
Max Holloway is regretting his contract to fight Gaethje. Max can literally fight the Georgian Champion Ilia Topuria at ufc 300 in April for the belt.
😢 end of an era
Timestamps: 0:01 Dana 30:23 Merab Dvalishvili  44:07 Ian Garry 1:01:23 Whittaker 1:11:53 Volkanovski 1:29:28 Ilia 👑
I find it hilarious Spaniards celebrating a Georgian victory. 😂
Dude this is the end of an era
Having a guy from Spain champion is fun! Look at the chants in the middle of the press conference, the joy, the show it will be if they take the UFC to Spain... This is so good and refreshing! What an incredible talent by the way of this fella. Hope he stop acting dumb tho and stays real to himself as hes an actually nice and cool dude.
Lo hizo chicos el lo hizo, he did it guys he did it.
Paddy the baddy in madrid
Sad to see volk go out like this but it is what it is guys. Also I know we all want to see max get the chance against ilia but gaethje is going to obliterate him and there’s nothing we can do.
Arriba España Arriba Topuria
new champ illia
Henry Cejudo got cucked by the UFC. Didn't even let him go on post fight
First
max holloway will be champ again
