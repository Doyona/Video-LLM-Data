If Breanna takes me to American idol she will probably be like hey yall ! I got the constant she is kinda mad right now she is wanting Katy if I see her she will probably be like hey you ! Do you want to come in with me ? I will probably be like yeah I do if I am crying she will probably be like it’s okay ! Your pretty tired make sure you give this one a nap she will probably be like yeah ! I will
Breanna is awesome
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How Motherly Carrie Underwood Cary This Constant's Child.
As a previously in the future stay at home mom dad uncle of 347 years the way Carrie made me feel about my position make me want it 4 more times every year. Just truly inspirational.
Thing about this audition is that Katy Perry fan edited it. Saying Carrie just came out and grabbed Emerson without Breena's permission to make Carrie look bad.
My mom grew up in deton tx
She is the winner in my eyes! She is going to have so much success!
Breanna Nix has one of THE most beautiful voices on american Idol and anywhere else. It's a shame she didn't win American idol because she really should have.
❤❤❤❤💙💙💙💙
I didn't watch the season but am surprised she didn't win instead of Jamal.
This is my favorite sing since i hear for the first time
Beautiful precious family. May God pour his Blessings out on this mommas beautiful voice and may she go far.
I wonder how people who said they wouldn't watch American Idol this year because of Carrie  decided to come back home?
Even though Breanna didn’t win she will make it the music business.  I see her being a strong, popular singer like Adele!! You Go Girl!!👍👍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I LOVE YOU CRICKET!!!!!😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
SHES WINNING AMERICAN IDOL ❤
She is very talented but she is NOT as good as SLATER or Thunderstorm in fact she had the worst night when she was put through. I was suprised her and John were selected over Gabby. This show FALLS apart every year when people vote and turn it from a talent contest into a popularity contest.
A Nix girl?! I have 5 in my family. My name is Margaret Nix from MA and just sharing my last name with an American Idol finalist is an honor. I too had a dream to sing when I was younger, but Idol wasn't around before I turned 29. I am a serious Journey fan and when you sang Open Arms, I was impressed. I do realize we are not related, LoL, but I felt compelled to comment and hopefully you read this! Since the career in singing didn't pan out for me, I decided to do my#2dream which was become a teacher. I am now a professor of mathematics at a local community college. I will continue to watch your career! Thanks for singing your heart out for the Nix girls in Massachusetts!!
Don't think I've ever cried watching audition before, but this!  Something about her mama's magic, the lyrics feel too real and just beautiful delivery.
So cute, his mommy’s soothing voice, puts him to sleep.
Love this. Everything about u says, " i am the American Idol "
Carrie is kind
I hope Brianna wins it she deserves it
🎉🎉🎉🎉 love it
Stay home mom is the best for the child   God bless you all
Beautiful family God bless you all.  God is awesome God
I kinda like seeing Carry with her hand rasied to God during that song....beautiful
Top 3 baby!!
Only God would have known that this Sunday Breanna is in the top 3 on Idol and could very likely win. Win or not she has been the witness that Idol needs on stage and maybe to those backstage.
I live in Denton! We are so proud of her and her family!
A "stay at home Mom" is something that many Mommas dream of being able to do, and they can't.  It's truly a gift to be able to care for your own child and not have to drag them to a sitter or day care every day and then go work away from home.
I think the addition of Carrie Underwood will bring many viewers back to AI
My queen❤
Oh my. When she let go in that chorus gave me a tear. You go girl
3:55 preciousssss!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I just love Breanna Nix! Beautiful inside and out ❤
Not only is the baby falling asleep the cutest thing but the way he looks at his Mama as she starts singing is just...🥹🥹
If this woman doesn’t win the Idol then America is absolutely freaking crazy.
Such a God sent moment, watching this video.  So beautiful.
If Brenna takes me to American idol in the future she will probably be like Anna come on ! It’s time to go in if I am scared Emerson will probably be like I can take her in mom ! If I am happy he will probably be like wait for me ! Anna if I kept running towards the room he would probably be like sorry  she’s extremely fast ! I Havant been in here in a while if! She may start crying the Song that she is gonna sing is extremely tough for her her bestie passed away at the age Of 19 if I am crying he will probably be like it’s okay ! Luke can you hold her for a minute I need to grab his phone ! My mom has it if she hears me crying she will probably be like here Anna if I am happy he will probably be like works every time ! If I sing the song he will probably cry Like  I am so proud of you! If he puts me up on his shoulders he will probably be like she loves her shoulder rides ! If I am crying in the car he will probably be like I know that was a tough song for you ! If I am crying worse his dad will probably be like Emerson I think we may need to swap out she’s crying worse he will probably be like Ok if he gets me to fall asleep he will probably be like she fell asleep !
Lil man gat , beautiful voice so adorable ❤
🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
Tears are literally rolling down my cheeks
I love how Carrie just hugs him and lets him fall asleep to his mama singing. I love this video so much.
she's obviously nervous but you can hear she has a high quality voice.
Breanna you are absolutely incredible and your baby boy is beyond gorgeous, your voice made me cry ❤️❤️❤️ insanely talented wow 😍😍😍
2:32 that little smile was the cutest thing ever!
Breanna deserves to have her own label. She and her husband were awesome.
Good on ya momma 👩  + your stay at home mom job is the most important  Like Carrie and your fellow other judges  Lionel and Luke  Agreed
You inspire us! Keep up the good work! ♥️♥️♥️
3:09
Love this family, beautiful husband (the inside) for helping her in her life (she said that in interviews). Rooting for her.
2025 America 🇺🇸 I dol Wins my favorite breanna I love ❤️  God bless 💒🙏😇❤️
Breanna Nix is the next American idol!!!! We love her here in Oregon!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Definitely love the different vocal flows, it's like she took the song and made it hers.  Baby boy looked so tired yet proud of Momma!❤
I LOVE Carrie! She is so genuine and kind hearted. 😍
what everyone felt during this audition was the spirit of God moving.  From the moment Iheard that song years ago from Carrie, I cannot help but to break down.  God has been so good to me and trust me when I say...just like the song...I cant do this on my own.   So many of us are tired and weary of the way this world is right now.....but Gods light is shining brighter than ever .   This was a "church" moment for so many of us.  I love this so much, along with her next perfomance of the beautiful  Laren Dagel song "you say".  Jesus said "if I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me".....and that is exactly what we are feeling.
So was that a no?
I loved her story!!!
This is my fav single from carrie❤❤❤
She has a beautiful voice and that song was beautiful!  Jesus Christ is Lord and He Saves Souls 1st Corinthians Ch15 Verses1-4
Imagine being held by the woman who sang the song your mom sang in her audition.
So sweet Carrie  holding her son.
Sweet, beautiful Carrie, please lose the fish lips!  They make you look so common and so fake.
Breanna nix gorgeous
As big as AGT has been and is, Carrie Underworld has surpassed and outshines the entire production.
Wow a real mother ..Its nice to see some women still take mother hood seriously...That kid will probably urn out to be a decent straight male...
Amazing ❤
Lord in love it
Ouahhh this season changes everything. Jesus take the wheel! Jesus wins over satanists
It’s a no from the kid 😂
Carrie: *"Can I pick you up?"* Little boy: *"Umm, YEAH...🥰😍"*
Emerson is a child ahead of his time.  WOW  Sweet.
This singer's voice puts her in my personal Top 10. Beautiful and Soulful Voice. I appreciate that she sang in her own register and didn't over-perform.
as a 23yr old sahm, i’ve never felt something so personally. i’m sobbing like a baby. ♥️♥️♥️
I hope she gets to the live show, cause then I'm voting for her. I don't normally vote for country people, but if they can touch me like Breanna did here, then they can get my vote during the live shows.
Did she get through ???
C'est tellement bon tellement agréable son fils s'endort sous le son de sa voix.. Parfection
She has a   beautiful baby
The beauty of a Godly woman always shines through, and boy the way she held that one note. Beautiful.
❤ aww beautiful and so cute  her son❤
carrie got momma energy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:55 lovely! Very hard job❤
I love the fact that Carrie Underwood has come full circle to where she started and listing to ppl that are singing her music as she did some 20yrs ago...
Awwwww❤❤❤❤❤ his mothers voice is so pure she puts him to sleep
That was a beautiful audition. And the Emerson falling asleep was so precious. Thank you Carrie for saying what you said about stay at home moms. It’s a very important job.
I hope she went through
Beautiful song; boring audition.
Wow she's so good. I know sometimes they say singing a song by one of the judges in front of them can be hard
That little smirk from Emmerson when she started singing was like "Ok Mommy I got their attention now its time for you to shine." And him falling asleep was Ok Mommies got this im going to sleep on this nice ladies lap.
I 😂lmao when he dozed off
CARIE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WTF CONVINCED YOU TO INJECT YOUR LIPS.... ???? STOP!!!!!
Maybe an unpopular opinion:  She has a good voice but she needs to work at it much more.  Other singers deserve a chance.
She'll win or at least be in the finals. Bet.
Breanna im so proud of you! You're so beautiful ❤️
Wow. Amazing. I'm curious as to why he said he was iffy about the first/opening. It sounded like a recording, honestly. There was ONE hint of a flat note, but she was nervous, as anyone would be. But the belting was flawless. Not one wrong note, no straining. That's not easy to do live ESPECIALLY in an audition, at least without practice/experience, from a professional New York singer's POV, I think she definitely has experience etc, she sounds pretty polished honestly. My best advice would be to always keep your eyes open and not to close them when you sing, pick a spot on the wall over their heads, and then sweep your gaze over your audience. I'm sure they'll tell you all of that,  Well done, girl!
it wasn't all that great audition. not memorable.
Top Ten
That song is for him, like many of us is our SAFE PLACE Tune!!!
Amen 🫶🏼
Awesome!
Wow 😳 her belt is incredibly beautiful and controled. She maintained her strength. Amazing
That’s Carrie Underwood? 😮😮 she looks different
So beautiful ❤❤❤ Praise the Lord 🙏
Oh my Gad I’m bawling in the bathtub watching that sweet baby fall asleep to his mammas voice! How could they say no to that😢😢😢
0:47 yep, now I’m crying 😢😢😢
Carrie was born to be a mother and it definitely shows
So, did they pass her through to Hollywood?
Beautiful voice! That little baby is adorable!! lol! <3
Beautiful voice! I have tears in my eyes after watching this.
What? No performance review?
She"s good.
She got guts to sing Jesus Take the Wheel in front of Carrie Underwood. She did a wonderful job singing 😊
I miss Katy Perry tho
Maybe the most beautiful audition in history.
Love her voice! Thank you for correcting her Carrie being a moma is full time!!!!! What a moment singing Carrie’s song while she holds your baby! Love her husband is accompanying her!!
His little smirk was so cute 🖤
I love how Carrie said never just say I'm a stay-at-home mom because stay-at-home moms have the worst job there ever is she's a taxi driver she's got a license she's a nurse whether she's got the license or not she's a cook she's the housekeeper she said 1,001 hats that people don't see because they don't want to see it my hat's off to stay at home moms they do the most awesome job anybody could ever do my hat's off again to all moms who stay at home to take care of their family
Hearing her say never say " just a stay at home mom" makes me feel so seen
💓
The best voice in the competition this is the American Idol right here
I love "don't say JUST a stay at home mom"
When mommy's voice soothes you and puts you to sleep.
So did she make it through?
Oh! Tomorrow, we'll recap week 2.
Doug Kiker has died. American Idol fans has been shock and since one Idol who beat out this female star you can identified, Willie Spence killed cause of his car wreck at 26, he was a contestant on this show. He worked as a garage carrier and been for several and as a singer who rise to fame when he appeared on American Idol. He was not suffered from COVID-19 but he was busy during that reality show as a singing competition like no other's 18th season. Judge Katy Perry who had left Idoland replaced by Carrie Underwood loved his rendition of Rascal Flatts' "Bless The Broken Road" and was moved to tears. Lionel Ritchie and Luke Bryan were the others share d about his rise to stardom that lasted nearly one year. Their family and artists close to him wrote on X and on instagram and facebook said his cause of death was not yet determined, He was 32 Years old. Later and take care.
Brenna Nix  Age 25 from Denton for Carrie Underwood song she first recorded after winning the competition in 2005, "Jesus, Take The Wheel" and Carrie did Take The Wheel the other two are Lam'Ron Smith Age 21 in Rocky Mount, Va. with "Pickup Man" by Joe Diffie and Crews Wright Age 17  from Samson, Ala with "The Fireman" by George Strait. Idol ran a little too late but it will be dropped on Hulu and Disney+ since airing tonight 8p east/ 5p west. Other never made it and sent home are these other when it's a no from the judge. Carrie will list it out as we say This Is American Idol. Later.
What a beautiful picture ❤
THE TEARS AND DEEP EMOTIONS SEEN HERE ARE FOR AND BECAUSE OF GOD JESUS CHRIST!!!!!!!!!!!! THE ONLY WAY............ THE SAVIOR HERE AND ETERNALLY IN GOD WE LIVE !!!!!!!!!!!! ALL THE GLORY BE TO GOD ALMIGHTY FROM GOD ALL MIRACLES  AND BLESSINGS FLOW FROM HIS NEVER CEASING ALL POWERFUL HOLY SOVERIGN RIGHTEOUSNESS !!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful  voice!
I’m crying it’s that good . ⭐️⭐️⭐️
@breannanixmusic  you made me cry driving and congratulations to the weight loss struggle is real after baby im right there with you
She made me cryyyyyyyyy trust in the Lord let Jesus take the wheel when times get tough in all his Glory amen
3:00 nope! I’m sure her son enjoys her voice but she shouldn’t take someone who is a better singer than her spot.
Good vibes from all around
Hate it that carrie is hiding her beuty with to much makeup and maybe some work
Love her voice,  sweet and simple straight to the point.
I've been listening to Carrie Underwood's "Temporary Home" that song touches my heart and brings me to tears everytime.
I have to quit re-playing this! I cry every time!! That little boy is precious!! As a mother, it’s a tearjerker to see all of the love. 🩷
You have a beautiful voice and a beautiful family you got this ❤
Sweet🎶 and Emerson is adorable. She did justice to one of my fave songs
Great job 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I love it. She’s amazing and it’s adorable that Carrie holds her boy
Great job, mom, and carry absolutely.You are the best
<G5>< HERE I AM! 🦾👽🛸~JESUS CHRIST  ☧
That baby is precious!!!❤
Well, her voice is amazing. Y'all know she sings him to sleep on a night the way he kept nodding off on Carrie whilst listening to his Momma.
That baby is lucky boy in whould
B2FUL!!🤗🙏🏽🤗
Her voice is amazing!
you made me cry ma'am!
Her voice was honestly so soft and calming. She sang this in front of Carrie with very little nerves. ❤
I really enjoy this show!😁😊👀🌞🌞
❤ Amazing , Beautiful & Precious ❤
Wow great voice!
Teary eyed anyone?
I'm a 45 year old grown man, that precious moment when his mumma sang him to sleep in the arms of the  lady that sang the origional..brought me to tears. I had a hallelujah moment. 🙏
I'm crying dang it!!!
I love that Carrie corrected her ("never say you're 'just' a stay-at-home mom."). Being a stay-at-home mom is the hardest, most rewarding, and culturally underrated job a woman could EVER have. I wish more women (and their husbands) saw that!
🎉🎉🎉
Wow I'm from Denton, Texas!
Her kid is adorable ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
What a beautiful story❤❤
This baby boy has been put to sleep on this song so many times
Carrie Underwood is a lot nicer than Katy Perry. Katy was rude most of the time and very snarky.
Awe the little Emerson was falling asleep!
Carrie Underwood it’s amazing ✨✨✨person artist singer ✨✨✨✨ what blessing have this outstanding person artistry at American Idol
OMG Carrie Underwood has come full circle....she's now a judge on the show that started her career.
Emerson you momma is  awesome sweet boy I 100% agree
Absolutely beautiful ❤
Made me cry. I am a fan.
Love Carrie
Oh my goodness!!!! Beautiful!!!! Just beautiful!!!!❤❤❤❤
Well said, Carrie! My mom raised all 12 of us, and that's one hell  of a job.
Beautiful voice !  Sweet little boy
What a beautiful audition & moment. From the sweet little boy falling asleep on Carrie’s lap while his mama was singing, to the beautiful song she sung, Jesus was definitely there & took the wheel! ❤ What a beautiful family!
Beautiful she’s going to get far!
Mommas got it! A little coaching and more confidence ❤
Emerson is too sweet! Look at those cheeks and  his big blue eyes!
My husband just asked me who was calling me.  Jesus, take the wheel is my ring tone.  Beautiful rendition.   And, Emerson was adorable.
Great voice! 🤍
Queers make the entertainment industry beautiful.
Awe he's falling a sleep to his mother's voice. Nothing compares
That's all Emerson needs! A song an a temple rub !😂😂❤
Luke is an angel . God bless him
Beautiful voice for sure...
never say just stay at home mom. That is not only the most important job out there it is also the hardest unpaid job out there. Stay at home moms are so special.
hope she gets to the top 10
this just made me a bit emotional
Jesus is coming 🎉🎉
The baby falling asleep! lol I LOVE THIS! SING MAMA BREE!!!
As a previous stay at home mom of 15 years, thank you Carrie for telling her to never say "JUST a stay at home mom".   I respect that so much.  Thank you for making the under appreciated stay at home moms out here feel seen and valued!!  I love you even more for that!  ❤️
God bless you! What a gift❤
Our babies change so much about us in the best possible way.
She is really good
He can say he slept with carrie underwood back in texas
Please keep Carrie as a permanent judge please.
I think this one can win
Awe his little smiles!!! Oh my heart!! Sweet boy ❤❤
The boy had a moment and was cute but his momma is a professional singer. To sing that song in front of Carrie was spotless and beautiful
the cameraman/editors deserve an oscar. Ive been watching american idol auditions since season 1 and this may be the cutest one ive ever seen
Brooo that kids gonna be 12 and be like yup.. Carrie underwood held me and Luke Bryan put me to sleep!
Please normalize this
Love she’s from Denton!!! I went to college at the university of north Texas in Denton!!! Lots of music talent around
That little smile smirk. <3
Achei ela Maravilhosa ❤ que Família linda, voz Abençoada, seu filhinho até adormeceu fofo demais  🤍🎼🇧🇷👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It’s impossible not to like Carrie Underwood. Talent, class, and beauty. A true American icon.
"Never say 'I'm just a stay-at-home mom'". Exactly.
Beautiful voice. Beautiful family.
beautiful - her singing and the little boy falling asleep listening to it 🧡
I LOVE Carrie Underworld on American Idol!!!! Full Circle!
Breanna and Abi are my favourite so far. But man, there have been some AMAZING voices this year. An Aussie fan.
of all of them thousands of additions on Idol this is the most wholesome and beautiful this is the one i will remember
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
You might found a new country singer right there, she's phenominal, magical, amazingly good. What a stunning voice!
Did she make the cut?
Absolutely amazing ❤❤❤
Carrie was so cute choking up.  Sweet little boy, her song and memories of going through this process and where it led her.  ❤
This made me so teary! That boy loves his momma like my son loves me just I can’t sing
She has an amazing voice
I stopped watching American idol after the 4/5 season but because of Carrie I will watch it!!!
Okay Breanne, you’ve sang beautifully.
That boy has fallen asleep to many a lullaby from Mom! 😴 Adorable
So  beautiful  .
I hope she made it through.
Did she make it through they didnt say
this was so cute. i hope she wins. made me almost shed a tear.
Her story.... #GooseBumps ❤
Beautiful rendition!
Beautiful family
She is amazing.😊
Very talented, but bad song choice. One of those moments where you can just see the massive gap between “very talented” and “actual superstar.”
Carrie Underwood is a class act. I love that she knows how important SAHMs are and isn't afraid to say it on national TV. Beautiful job singing and I love he fell asleep with Carrie. More family values and more families please!
I couldn’t recognize Carrie… what happened to her face?
Ok way to go Denton Texas♥️ such a beautiful family ♥️♥️♥️ you’ve got this ❤
Carrie's lips.  OMG.
Good job mom! ❤❤is with you.
That cute smile on Emerson's face literally tell's us that she always sings him to sleep every night..
It's so powerfull, i can feel it 🤗❤
Beautiful job!!
The way her son was just glued to her and starting to fall asleep.. just beautiful ❤
Great voice...top 3 easily
How precious! 😅 She had a beautiful voice.
good voice.....fall good for the ear
Being a stay at home mom is a job. 😊Emerson is so handsome ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢❤❤❤❤ wow that was so beautiful
Huhhhhh.   This young mom can sing!  She sounded amazing and will do fabulous.  Her son drifted away with her beautiful voice.  And CU is right!  Not "just" a mom IF done right it's an every minute, hard job but much needed and necessary.  What a mom man, he is one fortunate boy and so is her husband.
Wow! Carrie will put American Idol on the map again! Love it love it looooveeee itttt Carrie is just the best
What a set of tonsils on her this woman has! Wonderful!
wow so pure
I think it's time for a stay at home mom to win American idol! We have never seen somebody like this win. And I think it's time to show that it's never too late to follow your dreams.
Dammm That Girl sang JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL Better Than Carrie Does!
When you combine her voice with her tone and her ability to emote, she is super talented
PRECIOUS BOY PRECIOUS MAMA
That little kids facial expressions were funny ngl 🤣🤣 great performance and story!!
Carrie Underwood on AGT is the best thing that’s ever happened!!😆😍
Carrie and Emerson have an incredible bond
Omg, such a handsome, cute and adorable little boy..Gby all
Rooting for you. Cheers from a fellow Dentonite.
Wow amazing voice❤
That’s so good and beautiful. I Can’t Believe that She’s from MY Hometown, Denton ! 😯😮😭
I already know that Gabby is going to make an appearance and a story with Carrie this season. She is the #3 artist to ever come out of American Idol.
I love Carrie. She is such a class act, always has been
Everything about this was absolutely beautiful
Beautiful. Her voice is angelic 😍
Thinking she will might not win but I'm sure she will get a recording contract and should be on the radio in a year or so 😊😊😊😊😊
I think you are awesome~~Beautiful voice as well~~I'll be rooting for you and sending Prayers and Blessings to you and your beautiful family~~The best of luck to you~~💖💖💖😄😄😄~~
She is very good
Ballsy singing in front of the person who originally sang it. She nailed it
Wow another Carrie underwood
She has what it takes to win. ❤
She was nervous I know with some work she can be alot better.
That was amazing.. I haven’t watched American Idol in many years. Since Carrie Underwood is one of the judges this year, I will definitely be watching it.
Why all commercials non-White??
The baby boy loves his mom so much, it is so evident how much they mean to each other. Lucky kid.
Wow!!!! She is amazing no doubt! Great voice
Wow!! That was beautiful!!! ❤❤❤
Wonderful!
Beautiful voice and the baby is just precious
Aww that adorable little boy looks so very comfortable sitting on Carrie‘s lap while being put to sleep by his mother‘s beautiful voice! This is just the cutest thing I’ve ever seen! You’re the very best Carrie Underwood!
😍💕💯🥰
What a beautiful voice
Love it !!!!!
#FreddieForTheWin
She’s a phenomenal singer, singing that big song by Carrie Underwood who is in the panel right now, and I agree with what Carrie was saying, she did a really good job!
That sweet little boy smile @2:31
Perfeição descreve tudo.🥰🥰❤️❤️🙏
Wow ❤💕✅
she’s not even better then singing it, I guess. carrie does anyway but no one. sounding it on first cd. 4:40
She is amazing! She can win!
American idol should have more diverse judges meaning not two country singers
The little boy is the cutest! Momma did great!
Enough with the lips Carrie!!
Geeze Underwood is unrecognizable.
Sorry but no
Emerson's mom did great. Carrie, lighten up on the makeup and filler...God made you beautifully, you can't improve on His artwork.
God, help her voice be heard. Lovely!!!
Once she starts singing her son feels everything will be ok time to sleep
those lips aint it sistah
The more I watch, the more obvious it is……just how much work has Carrie had done?!?! She looks nothing like she used to. Her lips are way too much!
Is this american idol or country idol
I honestly thought i was looking at Katy Perry at first , they hollywoodize them all to look like stepford wives. I hate to say it and will orb catch shade but I prefer this contestants voice over Carrie. It’s less harsh and nasally. Very beautiful tone and control
Wow😢
Good lord.  Carrie...stop it with your lips.
Carrie- STOP with all the cosmetic procedures
That little boy is super precious
I don't expect to watch AI because of Carrie Underwood. Her singing at the inauguration of the person in the White House with offensive.
You know that mama sings to her baby ❤️
this is so heart-warming
So beautiful all the way around 💕 So glad these judges are full of warmth and encouragement, not  the way  when Simon was there❤
She had a different vibe and it was beautiful. And her son happily drunkenly smiling in the beginning was so adorable
I love Carrie as a judge thank god Katy Perry is out
Love CARRIE and this whole audition
He’s gorgeous
AMAZING GRACE!!! JUST SO BEAUTIFUL !!!!!!!❤🫠😇🥰🤗
Awwww❤❤❤❤
Her son is so cute ❤😂
Carrie Underwood love her
Can’t watch American Idol anymore with MAGA Underwood. So sad seeing her racist support for a hateful government. We can’t be such a hateful place. With messages from her that call for hate. Sorry
God blesses in mysterious ways
Wow!!!! So beautiful I cried ❤😢😊
Great song great voice
Carrie is a natural with kids. That little boy recognized an "earth mother" and relaxed enough to be ok with her holding him. Earth mothers exist in place of angels and that voice is definitely angelic!
Beautiful ♥️
beautiful strong voice!!
Emerson is such an angel
That is so sweet! What a beautiful story and beautiful family. Carrie seems so down to earth too, gotta love her!
I love it
She's Jiggypuff to her son lmao
Great song, greetings from Indonesia
Soooo, did she get a golden ticket!!!
Can we just say how adorable and handsome that little boy is and momma can SING!!
Carrie Underwood "what a beautiful family" Translation what a beautiful "American" "white" "Christian" "normal" family.
Man that's a tough song , but she did it cuz she felt it❤❤❤
CARRIE!!! ❤❤❤
That boy is adorable and a winner. He was like listening on a lullabye.
Sorry it’s a no for me … singing Carries song is not for the average singer
It would have been nice to know if she made it through. Cutting off their was stupid.
This Vaby  boy made me tear up!:(  was falling asleep While Jesus Taken the wheel❤🙏
U can tell she's an amazing woman. Strong, kind & absolutely beautiful. Something about how she sang it hit a little deeper for me than it ever has.
Homeless breeding more homeless
Carrie Underwood had so much face surgery I didn't recognize her.
🥹😭
I've picked my winner. 🫰🏻🫶🏻
Such a adorable little boy
Denton Texas!
Beautiful mom, wife and a ⭐️
She has a beautiful voice. 💖
❤❤❤❤
Jesus all mighty.... That little smile at the beginning...
So incredible to watch Mom sing with all her heart while she sees her baby boy fall asleep in Carrie's arms. This brought tears to my eyes. I hope she goes far.
She actually gave me the chills.
Main youtuber hun mera YouTube chintaRajbhar hai😢
I would appreciate this channel keeping the feedback of the judges!
Get it b  love ya cuzzzzzz can't believe you on TV 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ur the Best.
@3:40, 3:51 😴
I am in tears watching this and will watch this video clip many times.  Her voice is breathtaking!  I love her rendition as much as Carrie's!
She was amazing. That's a hard song..❤
Gosh i thought wtf happened to katy Perry what kinda surgery she had
Soooo sweet how he falls asleep ❤
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Can't wait to watch American idol on Sunday .
Am I the only one who feels the distress in watching a little boy so over-tired and needing to sleep that he can’t sit through one live song by his mom? Don’t know what time of day this interview was but the little boy needs a warm bed. He’s being a good kid by not making waves but it’s hard to watch him struggle to keep his eyes open.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
i hope she gets healthier & healthier 🙏🏽💚
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Already cheering for her
I hear a similar tone of Carrier… Mark this girl she has potential to win
Go Denton!
What an inspiring person…I hope she goes far, very pretty voice
Wow.
Breanna’s voice is absolutely breathtaking!✨ And little Emerson falling asleep to it? Pure magic!💙🎶
I mean seems like everything was right in his world in that moment, His Moms voice, Dad playing piano and apparently Carries calm arms,  She had total humble confidence singing Carries song in front of her but she was singing Jesus Take the Wheel her focus, 👏👏👏
Great video! Really enjoyed it.

Did she go through????!!!! She was good!! I want to see more.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Wow!! A Very good audition - I would give this girl an 8/10 but that’s very good indeed! It was beautiful and angelic and on a couple notes she sounded a lot like Carrie underwood- I don’t really consider that copycat either - for most of the song she sounded like her own different self. How far will she go in the competition though? Was it good enough to be in the top 24 of this year? Who the heck knows. But I think she has a decent shot at it at least, but Obviously nothing is for certain- there are a LOT of super singers.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!

All this is making me love my mother more! 😊 Carrie made remember the enlightened words of Prophet Ellen G. White, "If married men go into the work, leaving their wives to care for the children at home, the wife and mother is doing fully as great and important a work as the husband and father. Although one is in the missionary field, the other is a home missionary, whose cares and anxieties and burdens frequently far exceed those of the husband and father. Her work is a solemn and important one.... The husband in the open missionary field may receive the honors of men, while the home toiler may receive no earthly credit for her labor. But if she works for the best interest of her family, seeking to fashion their characters after the divine Model, the recording angel writes her name as one of the greatest missionaries in the world. God does not see things as man's finite vision views them." — The Adventist Home, Chapter 38

She did a good job singing that song that only Carrie really does it justice. It is such a hard song to sing in terms of vocal control and she did it ok. Good enough to move on, but her little boy was adorable falling asleep on Carries lap

Every life is precious so the gospel is needed in any situation: because we sin against God's laws we deserve the physical and spiritual death penalty because "the wages of sin is death". However, God loves us so much that He came in human form (Jesus) to sacrifice his sinless life in our place to bail us out of our penalty. Please consider Jesus <3 trust in Him and repent of sin out of love for Him

This performance was amazing. I love Carrie Underwood and this is my favorite song of hers and How Great Thou Art with Vince Gill. I’m definitely gonna start watching American Idol again.
This is such a hard song, and I don't usually like people singing Carrie's songs. But this isn't live so it's easier to handle it. It's just a lot more difficult to sing these songs live. Breanna handled this really well and managed to impress Carrie herself. She hit those notes beautifully. She's so sweet and her kid is so cute!

So what happened?? Is she going to Hollywood??

It’s so cute I love Carrie and this girl did it great
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did she make it or not?
I love her. Beautiful voice and family
GREAT job ❤❤❤
She's definitely a front 3 winner
Did the girl get to go on? I love this video!!
Ok, I'm in tears. I think he has heard that many times when going to sleep. My wife used to tell a story about a bear to my grandson, he would go to sleep before she finished a sentence.
Beautiful😊
If Carrie is a full time judge now, I just may start watching American Idol again.
Yeehaw Texas! Denton is the best ♥️
Love that babies face. He loves his mom and her voice.  Loved watching this.
You can tell without asking that she's a graduate of the greatest singing training academy, her local church!
Jesus🎶❤️❤️❤️🥰 Amazing voice 🎉
I L💙Ve Carrie Underwood.. NOT HAPPY THAT SHE SANG FOR TRUMP..HER CHOICE.. HER CHOICE AND I HAVE TO RESPECT THAT.. STILL BLUE HERE..💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Tears.  Beautiful. Beautiful child beautiful singing moving song
Rooting for you!! Beautiful melodies ✨♥️🙌🏾
Love this song! Thank Carrie😢
He is going to grow up and be amazed that he was being held by Carrie Underwood.❤
omg could they trowel any more make up on Carrie.  She's naturally beautiful, leave her face alone!!!
This was really special! Good job you stole all of our hearts 🥺
She’s really good but this brings me back to last season when someone quit because of their kid
nope, next
Very mediocre singer
Wow, this is crazy. Carrie Underwood, as a judge now from contestant to idle to judge.
Did anyone get goosebumps!!
Her son his so precious and she’s amazing ❤️
This has been a favorite song of mine, since the first time I heard it ♥️🙏
MaMa just set the pace for her baby Watch her fly yonthe Win
Her story touched my heart as a stay at home mom of 3 ❤
Would’ve been good to see what they said !!! … that was an awesome performance !!!!!
oh my god i love that song  play my room  l m crying for that song  😂
This voice is amazing, the judges are like family showing their geniune love for people, this is reason why I love American idol more than most other countries idol programs.
That's the sweetest audition I've ever seen ❤
Whats wrong with Carries lips. Horrible
Carrie, stop wearing so much makeup
Carrie, please stop with lip filler. You don't need it😊
The fact that Emerson is comfortable enough to fall asleep on Carrie’s lap says a ton for her Mama magic. Love this video!
Beautiful❤
@2:31, that smile. That baby knows his mama's got this.🩷
I love how he just is falling asleep, her voice is beautiful
Beautiful ❤
He’s falling asleep to his mom’s voice! Such a beautiful moment
that smirk of his!!! set the tone for everything that followed ❤️ well done ma’am. may God bless you all!
Love this audition. She should do well in the competition. So great to see Carrie as a judge. She’s brought idol back in my living room for the first time in over a decade! ❤🎉
Wow
Carrie 👎 👎 👎
The “baby” is like four.
Chills. Beautiful voice. I’m dying laughing at the fact the little boy was falling asleep. Poor little dude had an early morning and used momma to go to sleep 💛😂
Even my two bestfriends who are both Muslims sang this song with me way back in college just to go through every gruelling exams.
sahm here as well   Big fat tears
🥹🫠❤
Stay at home moms need to be treated like royalty…God bless those who do it
How beautiful is this? God Bless this family and the best to you Breanna throughout your journey! The power that came through your voice when you opened up was amazing! You will learn a lot from this American Idol Walk, Great Job.
Beautiful ❤
Oh this one's going viral!
Awww, look at that little kid.
She might win this after that.
Beautiful promo for Ozempic and lovely singer ❤
This was the most wholesome and honest video I've seen in a long time.
Carrie is warm and lovely. She's a perfect addition to the team.
🤍🤍🤍
That little boy is worth it all.  SO precious. Mamma done good.
Excellent  voice and great control🎶....the boy is too adorable💗
CHILLS 😭
2.30 Baby was like. Mom got this xD
Wow. She’s absolutely amazing and such a cute family. The little boy falling asleep to his mama singing is so cute. Also Carrie holding him was precious. I really think she will go far on American Idol and I can’t wait to watch her this season.
Denton, TX in the house! Yes! So happy that Breanna took this chance.  Wishing her much success!
That little boy will have a story to tell when he's a bit older. " I once sat in Carrie Underwood's lap. "
Her tone is a little deeper then Carries.
Great job, great song, great kid, great family (hubby on the keys). One question, Is she going to Hollywood?????
Beautiful
The fact the lil one is dosing off says it all!!!
There's your winner right there sign her now before she gets away
Singing her son to sleep how cute 🥰 ❤
Audition made me cry. I’m also a stay at home mom and sometimes you feel like you don’t do enough and it’s just amazing. I’ve always struggled with self-love and self appreciation and this is just absolutely beautiful. I hope you have the most amazing journey and you have a beautiful family. ❤
God bless you momma
I’m dying . That little boy being put to sleep by his beautiful mommas voice. This is magical
❤❤❤
She has such a beautiful voice, and her journey of her weight loss for the best of her son is absolutely heartwarming. And watching her son fall asleep and Carrie Underwood’s arm is actually amazing. You can tell he is absolutely comfortable. Good job can’t wait to see what you come up with next.
Carrie has got a mama’s touch.❤
the kid is the winner
Beautiful family and an awesome singer
this is so sweet. She was really good and her son is so adorable falling asleep there. Oh my gosh that’s the cutest thing ever.❤
Its the baby falling asleep for me. He is used to Momma putting him to sleep with her beautiful voice.
😢absolutely beautiful!❤
Her voice is so beautiful and has such richness and depth in certain places. I will be looking forward to her future!
Some stay-at-home moms become singers by sharing videos of themselves singing on social media. Payson Abbott and Stephanie Ferrett did just that.
That kid is precious. Mommy's got a great voice!
Beautifully Done Breanna! Could tell the High notes were a little difficult, however, she made it her own & that's good because an singer doesn't want to sound SO MUCH like an artist it can lean too close to karaoke. I liked Breanna's sound and believe IMHO She could make it to the TOP 10, I Knew right off the bat that Carrie had a chance at Winning and see where she is! 👍🏻 ALL The Best To Breanna I'll be cheering for her! 🤩🎼🎶  On another note PUN How Did Breanna Lose the weight? I have SO MANY Health issues I'm at my largest 310 IF I Don't lose some significant weight I'm going to have a heart attack, stroke etc. Nothing is working not even Ozempic which causes MY IBS Issues 🙏🏻🙏🏻
From stay-at-home mom to recording artist, she’ll be taking her son on the road with her until he’s an adult.
Here comes a Grammy.
A good sad or challenging background is all that’s needed to win idol.  Also bring your kids and sing about Jesus.
Top 10...raw ..just watch bloom for her  and her family
It was wonderful  song and son🥰🥰
Stop with the lip stuff, Carrie!
When this song first came out years ago it led me to Jesus. ❤ Thank you Carrie Underwood
Mom’s singing puts him to sleep. Lol!  Handsome & adorable.  Mom looks like Miranda Lambert, with beautiful voice. What a handsome family w talented parents.  Good luck!
This is not how you sing this song i didn't feel any emotional connection
Right there is the winner...Has a backstory, singing a carrie song, similar to carrie..
Has this episode aired yet??
Awesome.
Awesome job!!❤❤
❤ WOW! She did amazing! Keep up the great work! Very Beautiful!❤
She is a fantastic singer ❤
She seems to have the same  tone as carrie!!! so beautiful. no wonder she chose this song
God, god ❤ this touched me in so many ways. I love her and love her voice! Great song! Her son is so adorable! I love you Carrie ❤ Queen! Your songs touch every one ❤ you’re amazing! This season will be amazing!
❤🙏🙌✨️❤️Breanna is amazing! ❤ That's a very difficult song to sing, and she nailed it ❤️✨️🙌🙏❤️
She is a fantastic singer.
Rubbish
That little boy so cute.
Can't wait!
Have a voice like a angel❤️
Beautiful..❤
I adore Carrie Underwood! I will love this year!!!
"Jesus Take The Wheel" 🙌 1 of my 1st favs of Carrys! ❤
These people truly started families so early (likely influenced by religious reasons)
Recording his racing too much, but I bet she sounds good and normal sound💕
I am boycotting American Idol for the first time since it began because Carrie Underwood’s support of Trump. And I voted for her on Idol. I wish I hadn’t.
first of the season .... She is gonna be good this season..... both the ladies in this video
