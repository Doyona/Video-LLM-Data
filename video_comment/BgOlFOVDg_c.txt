Super!!!
The Georgian team, which that bitch is the daughter of Eteri the mobster are even more overscored than the Brits, despite not placing that well.  They should be ashamed.  If Eteri wasn't the bitch's mother, they would be lucky to crack 70.
Fear & Gibson were disgustingly overscored per usual. They are truly one of the most overrated teams in history.  They are entertaining, but technically they are weak, and she can't skate worth a damn which should affect their PCS severely, atleast in the skating skills section too.
So the Finnish team coached by the Italian man who won a world title despite not being able to skate Maurizo Fartgalio, comes 6th on neutral turf.   Shows how corrupt and ridiculous their bronze on home ice was last year all along.
Fear & Gibson are usually grossly overscored.  I am sure he gets atleast a 5 point bonus just for being gay in his scores.  Guignard & Fabbri underscored.  Both Czech teams underscored.  The horrific Finns overscored, but atleast not as much as they usually are.
So Val and Kazimov did not even qualify for the free dance! I bet the Spanish FS association is regretting they send the two over Smart and Dieck! Olivia and Tim would have easily qualified given their reputation internationally!
Ļoti skaisti❤Igauņi super🎉🎉🎉Lietuvā skaisti viss ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ни костюмов, ни танцев, ни танцевальной музыки.  Раньше спортивные танцы на льду были сродни искусству. Доставляли людям величайшее наслаждение.  А теперь сплошные ужимки и балаган.
Let’s see how long before the haters grace us with their lovely prose and sportsmanship. What I read in the chat room for a brief period during the event was enough to make one’s stomach turn.
Lilah & Lewis 🇬🇧 nailed those twizzles 🙌🏻 I didn’t think the Italians were as clean….music edits a bit messy?

The marks are ridiculously inflated for the "Georgians".  Really shows that everything in figure skating is for sale.  For shame.
