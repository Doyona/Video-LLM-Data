Tuned into Tim for the first time in over a year and this dude is exactly the same. Money money subs subs money money. Tool bag.
7:44:33
7:18:25 Clutch
6:56:53 cloak loses his shit
Peanut does sound overweight, he's got that 300lbs out of breath when he speaks type voice.
Best BR game out rn
Did timmy get them shorts from boys 'r' us ?
2:50:18 tomorrow there’ll be a wartime paid ad lmao
9:05:59
The way Cloak repeats everything 3 times annoys the hell out of me
Peanut!!
W stream Tim.
This is honestly peak verdansk tier entertainment, this is fucking it!
love bf6 content
First streamer to get CTE
This is great to watch throughout my work day to get info about the game. I work 12 hours a day, so there's not much time to learn the basics at home. It also helps that Tim brings the comedy.
Game is awesome but i will never understand why people play as a group of 4 solos instead of a team. No one sticks together, people hording loot, engaging in mulitple fights at the same time. Shit is crazy to me that no one plays games as a team and gets mad when they lose
With the addition of the season and Redsec, Im getting hit with crazy Mw2019 nostalgia
Ninja hates the fact he’s recognize from playing Fortnite. Nobody’s thinking about you and your sensitive @ss tf outta here
Best BR and best content in years!
You should take notes from peanut he's able to go from game to game and still have the same amount of viewers unlike you
why are they tring so hard. just have fun. it's ok. it's not COD.
This is a resounding ‘meh’ is literally just another BR. Boring ass stream Tim
Almost watched the video but luckily ninja talked quick enough for me to click off
Tim just doesn’t give a fuck anymore. Sad
This br is sick
take chat off screen next time. they nonstop bitch like little girls and argue. its funny but not a good look
Peanut + the boys. Huge W
4:56:40 the bungulator arrives
The plating animation is so slow
Stop play BF6. BR isnt everyting in the game company. Go back to CoD and play BR there. Ur a toxic game ruiner like Swagg and the other trash heads.
Cause of shitty streamers like this is why BF is slowly tunring into CoD trash. Dumb skins nobody asked for and stupid seasons to pay for thanks EA and all the cucks.
Tim casually forgetting that battlefield has destructive surfaces lol then putting an artillery strike on himself like it’s cod is peak.
Holy shit peanut! I always wondered if they would play together. Definitely need more of this maybe some reactions
Gauntlet is pretty cool the this BR side is still un-needed garbage.
The fact that peanut was able to play with Nick Tim and clocky 🔥🤝🏻🤝🏻🤝🏻
Bro warzone is a thing of the past. Especially if bf6 maintains banning cheats. This game is absolutely the best game I've ever ran. This is definitely a warzone killer.
1:43:00 classic Ninja...
there better be a way to change the minimap from bottom left to top left
It’s not a warzone… it’s a BATTLEFIELD
I was upset when Tim requested this but now im happy.Thanks Tim for suggesting this.This is the best thing you've done beside Overwatch content.
Thank the stars they added a BR. Regular battlefield is cool and all but capturing the same OBJs over and over and over is boring AF. BRs are also better for squading up with the boys and dictating your story.
Yeah war zone is dead after this masterpiece is here 😂
Honestly kinda just seems like another war zone copy
Wow new game's hype exist??🤣
Codrot bullshit
Honestly the best br ever made
For those crying about adds.. YouTube Premium.. like 15$ a month… 0 adds. No matter what you watch. Shut up.~Also if you are in a situation where you can only listen. No problem screen off, full audio.
I'm so thankful that this br doesnt suck. I'll admit I was against it being a bf lifelong fan but this shit is unbelievable
So many losers in the chat butt hurt about Tim being on kick. What is wrong with you people.
BF has always had the right ingredients for a great BR and it looks like they finally got the right recipe.
PEANUT AND THE BOYS HOLY
🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜 🥜
*ABSOLUTE CINEMA*
3:09:50 Tim pops off. ❤
How much money did he make in this day of streaming?  Holy
Anti cheat is so ass it doesn't allow people to play over false drivers on p.c 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ guess I have a ps5 tho so oh well
When I was in high school, my father passed away - after this, I developed an addiction to video games.  It got to the point I would stay up all night until daybreak playing video games, and this went on for several years.  Strange thing happened though: in my 20's, I became a follower of Jesus Christ after praying to God and asking if Jesus is really His Son and died on the cross for me, and if angels and demons and all that is real.  Long story short, He showed and proved to me it's all real.  Not reaching out to judge anyone... like I said I used to enjoy these things very much.  But now I found freedom from that, joy in life rather than addiction, and surprisingly now I'm one of those people who I used to think are such weirdos: going around and telling people about Jesus haha  Inviting you to pray and ask God the same thing I did and give it a try - what do you have to lose?  -------  For anyone interested in how God proved these things to me, here is more info about experiencing His Almighty power:  After coming to Christ, I got water baptized and began to tell people about Jesus on the streets with other believers.  On several occasions, the Lord used me and other Christians I know to do supernatural things - just like it says in scripture:  -praying for people to be healed in Jesus' Name and they were supernaturally healed: injured legs to where a person couldn't walk right, sicknesses and headaches went away, etc.  -praying for people and demons manifest, sometimes speaking an evil otherworldly language, and the devils come out of the person in the name of Jesus Christ, just how it's described happening in the Bible  -believers in Christ being able to speak with a supernatural heavenly language that is not of earth (speaking in new tongues)  -also, there were times when people came to attack me when I was preaching on the street alone, and I prayed for God's protection - in one instance, an aggressive person got supernaturally pushed a good distance away when they got near me, and in another instance the angry person approaching me seemed to get 'stuck' at a certain point where something invisible was blocking them, and they couldn't approach any further  Mark 16:17-18 17 these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Looks good, I'm happy for the br players
Its not your aim thats bad you have to have trigger control
