Mark had the language going for this one!
Mate you said you had 6 inches in your stomach lmao and you’re worried about getting clipped 😅
I miss Amad 😫
No one time stamps anymore?
Lyon will be much more challenging but hopefully will have Maguire, Yoro and Mount back by then
Hate to say it but Man, they played well🎉👏
Give Ineos a chance
"Motivated like a fisherman's Turd" Wasn't that King Lear?
And apparently he doesn’t do enough, good joke😂
Great performance by UTD tonight! The players stepped up in the second half and actually passed the ball well. You could see the confidence growing in the players that have been having a tough time this season. RS players crowding the ref and moaning all night and their fans doing the pozan celebration in the first leg after getting a lucky penalty … all for nothing 😂😂😂 they weren’t even close to ever scoring from open play!
Hello mate, I don't mean any offence by this but do you have any special needs?
Bruno was great today because his overall game was great- not just the goals. His touch, control, passing workrate, partnership with Casemiro etc was what made him class… that’s what I want to see- not just headline goals or stat padding
Hm !!think ive repeated myself a few times here tonight!!?? ,hahaha never mind at least the light is shining brightly in the team tonight!!!❤ It
Zirkzee 10
Please INEOS give Ruben Amorim everything he says he needs this summer trust his judgement and make it happen. I feel like we could perform like we did tonight consistently under this manager who I trust to identify exactly the right type of player
Man u played beautiful football this match if only the team could do this consistently. And zirkzee what a baller he finally got his confidence up if only he had a bit of pace he would be a perfect player.
Bruv😂 penchester was scumbags bruv i swear this  club is joke 😂  pen never been  ref been paid 😂😂😂😂
Dorgu was unreal today, great signing
3 pens ! At old Trafford 😂 David coote will be on it tonight
Calling it now MU vs. Spurs in the final
Anyone got the timestamps?
Come on we are gonna win the Europa!! UP THE REDS🔥
Great to see goals and smiles on their faces. Well done.
Hi Mark!!...good eve,to you am actually very impressed and shocked that we actually played really well as a team and individually we actually got the win!!!..we are through!!! Our season is now not over yet!!!...keep going guys chin up !!!
Everyone played good tonight❤
Zirkzee, dorgu , heaven well done lad . Ggmu❤
Hojlund is our new McSauce passion and hardwork but sadly not good enough
Dorgu should be MOTM
Its hard to hate hojlund when he's trying so hard . Been trashing him for a while but one thing is for sure he gives his level best.
A solid team performance.
Have to agree, we played our best game yet, teams finally getting used to the tactics
Gernacho needs to be more polished in his final cross.
Dorgu is so humble and he’s skillful as well - he denied the 3rd penalty as well
Anybody that says zirkzee isn't good enough needs to go to specsavers he's class and getting better and better
Only team still undefeated 👹👹
What a player Dorgu is!❤❤
Zirkzee and Dorgu changed this team

Zirkzee motm for me
Hojlunds shooting 100% comes into question after today😅 but he had a decent game outside of that.
Still undefeated in Europe 💯
Today Bruno shut up everyone who talked about him
Bruno showed the haters
if dorgu learns how to shoot he will be very good
It took over 4 months but finally Zirkzee has arrived😂 He had a really good game and definitely found his position.
Corrupt referee
How have we missed our fullbacks bombing on from both sides.... Unselfish second half from garnacho Zirkzee is strongggg
United was really entertaining to watch today hope they can build up from here and keep improving
dorgu is a great player and has some great sportsmanship
GGMU❤❤
Penandes the pen merchant scores more penalties again cause that’s all he does
Hojlund man of the match
Hi🎉
from now on cherish every moment in Old Trafford ❤ GGMU
Best game under Amorim id say
