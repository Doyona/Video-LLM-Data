Everybody try but I want to know why ice prince will talk about ice on the neck and not have one on in the video lol
King Sark ❤❤❤
Sark said Yvonne did what?
Sark is the HIGHEST for a reason
Sarkodie is to Ghana as Olamide is to Yoruba people..they believe he is the best rapper in Africa. Rap is structured to contain lyrics, word play, rhymes and paunch lines..most of these indigenous rappers cant meet all these requirements with local dialect hence all these best rappers talk never involves them...Sark and Manifest cant be in the same rap cypher.
Sark's Aura is crazy 🔥
Landlord king sark ❤❤❤
Which girl is Obidi talking about 😂
King sark
