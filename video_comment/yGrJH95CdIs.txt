😢😰⚓🕯️
Biden’s military for ya
reporter sounds happy announcing this. 😢
💔
So they don't know how to swim? This story sounds fishy, no pun intended
I have heard of people searching for their lost pets longer than 10 days,what did they die for exactly in the Red Sea thousands of miles away from home?Raytheon? Israel?
I don’t like this one bit…we don’t just lose guys like this
Somehow I don’t believe we are being told the true story
Bullshit if you believe that story you are a window 🪟 licker
First of all they shouldn't have been there so I can't say thank you for your service for what?
WE SHOULDN’T EVEN BE THERE😡
Sad news indeed Rest easy boys
🙏🙏
That means to us are pussies and you're not looking for these two men
Gage was my friends son. I met him a couple of times. This really is such a tragedy. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.
Did they find the bodies?
another example of Biden's weak military
Yeah. About 1 week ago. What took you all so long? Had to wait for your masters to tell you?
My condolences to their families and teammates I believe these men are too important to their command.  So sad that ugliness has to enter in to this person's comments.  We Salute their Service!!!
Who ever was in charge of this operation needs to be court martial it doesn't make sense sending only two soldiers in unsafe waters at night for a "suspected boat"
Yeah that’s a cover story, they most likely raided an Iranian smuggling ship with 6 other seals got into a gun fight & those two lost their lives
Rest in Peace boys. Your service made a big difference to our USA Navy. God bless you and your families..😢🇺🇲🫡
It’s not a conspiracy theory or a huge secret that the entire political system as well as their corrupted foreign policies of imperial war and extremely destructive and obsessive thirst to rule over the entire planet has always been the reason!!!!!
how we lose our seals while boarding a non military ship man
R.I.P soldiers
I knew it
Hahahahahahahahaha
God bless our troops! Freedom is not free.
DUH. We knew that immediately.
How many of our men and women have died now at the hands of the democrats and their forever wars?
Andy Frisella predicted this. After the headline was read that they were missing he Said they are dead they just don't want to say it yet
Condolences to the family members friends and colleagues of these fallen heroes. Hugs kisses and prayers in the name of Jesus Christ...amen❤
This is what happens when you trespass and steal
Frigging sad 😢rip and love to their families
Foul play
You know they don't tell the truth about what really happened.. so sad.  Died for nothing.
But 2 sailors never samely =30000Civils palestinians deads by Israel and usa. Forces
RIP Hero’s 🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸 thank you for your Service 🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸. Biden and the Hungarian Billionaire immigrant George Soros and his Democratic Party are a Threat to the National Security of the United States 🇺🇸. How Pathetically Criminal.
And once again… Their blood is on Biden’s hands! If there was no Biden, fraudulent Biden, that is… There would be no war! Horrific!🤪👎🏻
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Possibly captured and not dead?
Salute you 2 badass soldiers fighting for this country. We support all of you and your families. Thank you for sacrificing what others wouldn’t.
I pray for them and There families. If it be possible , let them be Alright and make it back home.
Thank you for your service. My deepest condolences to their families.
You guys checked the ocean, but has ever crossed their minds that they could have made it to land?
Our deepest condolences to the families and team.
Oops
Condolences to their famlies
According to protocol " remain indoors of the cabin during high swells as you could become swept into the ocean where the survival rate is close to death"  I was on the USS Ashland in 2000 (M.E.U. 26, same deployment where "WE" almost opened fire on the USS Cole, the ship that was attacked by the pirates off the coast of Yemen)  Well, while on that ship (I'm a loner, i like to adventure around by myself)...we received an alert that there were High Swells and ANY DOOR (hatch) leading to the exterior of the vessel was COMPLETELY PROHIBITED from being opend.  Me, and my curiosity, and knowing the ship pretty well, as i was on there for months roaming around.... decided to jump down a few gang ways towards the hatch that leaded directly to where our military vehicles were strapped down on the exterior deck (plus, i knew that'd be the best time to get my cigarette 🚬 smoke in, as i knew NO ONE would attempt to open the door/hatch)  So i opened the hatch, and just the wind alone flung the door opened with brute force. I managed to close it back and proceeded to my Humvee.  Got inside, lit up my cigarette, puffed, enjoyed the feeling and now i am on my way back to the hatch.  I lie to you not, if you are ever on a military ship, you know the flight deck is nearly at least close to 100 ft from the surface of the ocean. And these swells were so dam high, i could walk over to the edge of the ship and touch the ocean, besides, the swells were pushing around on the flight deck, i had to grab something to prevent being swept into the ocean....my heart felt like it shot through my chest, Pure Panic.  Thanks be to....and ONLY GOD....i made it back to that hatch, but then it felt like it was locked or something because the handle wasn't turning, and a HUGE SWELL was on its way.  I got the door open, and hung around there for a while because I always premeditate my actions with thoughts like  1). People are going to be curious as to why im soaked 2). People are going to be curious as to why i smell like cigarettes So i hung around until i dried up a bit, then went back to the berthing area.  They say if someone goes overboard, they'll just do a head-count and try and send rescue 🛟 but really because it's Pitch Black at night, plus the high swells, you won't find a little dot...in the ocean..... basically you're good-as-dead....my life flashed quickly when i was out there on my way back inside....i thanked God i made it back in.  As far as protocols.....WE in the military do not live by the "every man for himself" attitude.  We look at each other as family, brothers and sisters . So that Seal that jumped in after his buddy, all that was probably going through his head was "i bet my buddy is terrified right now fighting for his life" so he made a "brotherly" decision to sacrifice his own freedom by trying to save anothers.  Salute 🫡 to both guys, Rest Up Soldiers, hopefully you're in God's care now
So did they walk to the boat? Where was their ship? They're not sending out just 2 guys in a zodiac on the ocean. The same way a helicopter can't keep up with a commercial airliner traveling at speed under the radar.
Really? Their dead?? They're not captured by our enemies?
Rest there souls 🙏🙌
In President Joe, Biden is doing nothing about this. He is a weak, pathetic man and needs to be replaced as soon as possible by a strong man like Donald Trump.
*I’m so glad things are finally back to normal since we got rid of orange man bad*
We interfere everywhere.
🇺🇸 Thank you for your devoted service to America, may you both RIP 🕊🙏🕊
Do they send 2 SEALs to check for contraband by themselves often? This whole explanation is not adding up at all.
Who tries to do ship to ship boarding using a ladder I'm those swells? Sounds like command incompetency not to do a helo fast rope insertion on that ship. Any ship to ship boarding could be done after the vessel has been secured.
Shouldn't they be MIA? Something isn't right with this.
Now nobody will expect them to appear in the middle of the night and do something really scary.  Perhaps that's the plan.
How about some info? Were the bodies recovered?
Doesn’t really make sense aren’t seals amazing swimmers I’m a little confused
Sadly 🎉😢
Many gave some some gave all. Thank you for you're service
Def not the real story
Probably would be a solid consideration to wear a GPS in your jacket in such conditions.
Guys, Salvation is Simple  HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”  YaH is The Heavenly Father  YaH arrives via the TENT OF MEETING YaH was Who they Crucified for our sins YaH was Crucified on an Almond TREE  — Ancient Semitic Cuneiform of Moshe (Moses) — Isa Scroll (The Original Isaiah)  Isaiah 42:8 "I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.  Isaiah 43:11 I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.  Isaiah 45:5 I am YaH, and there is none else.
My condolences and deep gratitude to their families and friends for their service and devotion. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hmmmmm. ARE. YOU. SURE.
I'm sure their death was fake 🤥
God bless these 2 wonderful men who died in service to our country..so very very sad
God be with their families.
Prayers for the families of these 2 brave men and praying they can be recovered for their families. This is heartbreaking.
Austin should not be in charge period.
They died in a place they didn't need to be, fighting a battle they didn't understand, in a country that meant nothing to them!  God watch over them, guide them where they need to be, Protect their family
How come nobody shows a picture of them?
How about telling us their names and showing their pictures ? RIP fine men 🙏🏼 thank you for your service 🙏🏼
Something fishy.  And you know what I’m saying.
No trackers no communication they didn’t try to grab them after they fell??! I feel wrong about this but I really don’t understand what was going on….
Sad
Biden, AIPAC and Israel killed them… Veteran here
Sorry but the sharks got em
Wasn't there a boat right there? And you know they were wearing lifejackets. Sus.
LOSERS!
I mean they could’ve just gone back to get them… seems like they just left them there to die
😮
Condolences to their families, God bless them
They got killed by the Houthis  or Hezbollah  fighters
Sorry for them, thanks for your service for America. My deepest condolences and prayers for their families and friends.
I feel the  death of battle buddy, friend, and team member and comrade Every mission I went on I did not plan on returning.. When I got back from patrol which was every single day, I can't say it was a good thing. 14 months waiting for that IED, ambush, or sniper. Just like the faces of your friends will never leave you, neither does your awareness of imminent danger. For example my friend died while conducting an overwatch mission so for me, not maintaining light and sound discipline equates to death.I do not turn them on. The loss of the seals on a Combat Mission will never leave the minds of their family and friends. RIP
The families of these two brave Navy Seals have only one person to blame for their lost BIDEN!!!
CRAZY! How do we not know they might possibly be POW (prisoners of war???)???
Sorry for their family....but these guys lost their lives 2000 km from USA border....for some politicians imperial ambitious
If they're missing, what if the terrorists took them or the aliens to get information? Don't stop the search!!
🙏Navy 💪 ❤Thank you for your service. Prayers to those families. RIP Brothers
God bless them and keep their families in your caring hands 🙏
Navy seals have a pinger on their uniforms when in active duty missions. A former Navy seal friend of mine told me. I believe him before I believe this administration
RIP Sailors.
🙏🙏
Did they have on life Jackets?
RIP, brave warriors, and thank you.
😱🥺😭 So sad, hope their loved ones are comforted by God!
This is an act of war. Iran is behind this
Bad commander, cost lives, waited for better weather, bad eecision
True Heroes, especially that 2nd Seal. 🕯️🕯️🥀🕊️🙏🏽
God knows the truth! Hebrews 4:13! Thank you for your courage and commitment! 🥹🙏🏽
why didnt they have a beacon locator that they could pull in case this happened? thats general equipment to have if you are about to perform a mission in volatile waters. this is shady. a 10 dollar piece of equipment should have been on them. another thing they more than likely had was an IR laser that they could wave around to show their location to someone searching in the skies.
Very sorry to hear this.  God bless them and every other service man and woman.  Freedom isn't free.  Thank you for my freedom.
Where is low iq Loyd?
Joe biden is steering the ship.
Do not approach the Red Sea, lest the jinn of the seas seize you.
May they rest in peace deepest condolences to the families
I blame the current situation on our current administration for the loss of our  military men we should all be sending prayers to the families of our loss soldiers 🙏
Rest in peace, warriors.
Fair winds and following seas, shipmates. We have the watch. 😢
A guy who can climb a 500' rope qith an 80 pound pack, fell? Sure.
Judgement is about to fall! Please turn to Jesus! Place your faith and trust in Jesus!  How to get saved! Believe!   A: admit you are a sinner B: believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord and He shed His blood on the cross as payment for all of your sins, He died, was buried, and rose the third day! C: confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord!  Today is the day of salvation! Choose this day whom you will serve!  “for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭3‬:‭23‬ ‭  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭  “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14‬:‭6‬ ‭  “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” ‭‭Acts‬ ‭4‬:‭12‬ ‭  ”For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.“ ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2‬:‭8‬-‭9‬ ‭  ”that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.“ ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭9‬-‭10‬ ‭
How do they know the first one fell into the water and the other followed ????! How how how  did the Iranians tell them?
😢
The passage of time will make it clear to even the more slow among us that the government is the foremost threat to life and liberty 🗽 😳
This story sounds like BS .
They did not fall into water and down 😢 more fake news government propaganda
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! Super Sad! Super Tears! They were probably shot at... Drowned.... And eaten by amphibious carnivores. Rest in Peace Brave Souls. We love you.  My beloved brother was A US Marine.  He served in Iraq Operation Desert Storm.  June of 2002 Aberdeen, Md After being "smarter than the VA Doctors" on his psyche ward, he set his heart on being unalive, and stepped in front of an Acela Train From DC to NY.  Super Tears for you KWW!
Rip to these two navy seals my heart goes out to them and there families 🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏
Biden just cares so much about are military and safety from foreign immigrant criminals vote kid sniffer joe biden and miss Camila biden 😂😂
Praying for their families and Seal family
FJB
This seems very suspicious. Not sure we should be buying this story.
These are Navy Seals, Don't underestimate their resolve, their abilities or survivability. I for one haven't wrote them off yet. I believe they're still alive and I would continue looking.....
The ocean is just too big to find them.
So sad
RIP.
What a shame.  So sorry for the families.
We All know they carry way too much in their packs as is. Way too much... But,  a flashing / strobe, white light / infrared  light,  smoke / flares, and more importantly, a GPS locator would be warranted, not Only during day operations, but certainly during night ops.  The days of looking for a person with the only means of locating them being a hand waving in the air is 100 years Out Of Date ! You don't send a million dollar asset into the drink without a means of recovery. . .PERIOD / EXCLAMATION POINT ☆
we lost some strong brave fighters who cant be replaced with this current soft generation to protect our country.
I like the idea of the myth of davy jones locker never dying and these seals going straight there.
Isn't this the plot of Jason Bourne?
These Navy Seals should be put in the Tomb of the Unknown because there Bodies are Lost at Sea or the Government should Make a New Tomb with the names of the Servicemen there there Bodies did not come Home. Thanks RINOs and Democratic for not listening to the Right Generals. Thanks Navy Seals for our Freedom you still give us
So, a SEAL fell into the water from an 8ft swell, and the other jumped in to save him? A  SEAL? Im going to call bs on this, and we need Mr. Don shipley to make a vid of how ridiculous this sounds!
LORD JESUS, COMFORT AND PROTECT
😂 for oil
They can be declared missing but not dead.  A hundred and fifty years from now they can be declared dead -- more than likely.
All the gear would drag and weigh them down.  I guess they didn't have life preservers on.  If they didn't have a buoyancy device while working on the ocean in rough seas nor a gps beacon, then those should be added to their kit...I would think.
Thank you Joe Biden for reversing Trumps decision to pull our troops out of that area. My condolences to my fellow shipmates and their families.
I don't understand:  I thought SEALS are the world's best swimmers.  What happened?
God bless the U.S military. Rest in peace Navy Seals. 🙏🥹❤️🇺🇸
I bet they were going to blow the whistle on something illegal we're doing for the Nutinyahoo regime
Why? Are we at war with Iran? Things are escalating quickly over there. Yemen, red Sea, sending ships here and there, Israels assault on civilians. Never have I seen a Palestinian tank on the news. Or plane or ship for that matter. And US is complicit and participating. Not in my name. Praying for peace for all people. 🙏
I personally think they are alive & on a mission.🙏
They definitely died in combat and the US wants to avoid a wider war.
Somalians say  That they shot down a U.S. helicopter but the US cannot even admit that it was shot down.  Now this story comes out  That these 2 navy seals drowned when navy seals live in the water are experts swimmers and we're supposed to believe this bullcrap!!!  Proof that America makes up stories In order to hide the real story of dead sldiers!
So sorry for the loss of 2 heroes 💔💔🙏🙏
I don't believe a word of this because you're talking about navy seals, they are some of the most ectensively trained military people
God bless and give rest to 2 of the best.                                    ⚓️
Where’s my comment?
Sorry to hear this😢 . I'm surprised they don't have some emergency inflatable bladder they can activate to help them float in water. I know they are the strongest swimmers but treading water for a long period of time with that heavy gear must be almost impossible. I'll assume all seals carry some form of a homing beacon to help with rescue location?
Rest in peace ❤
Iran weapons?? The ones biden sold to them? ?😯
Biden didn't even try to rescue nor find them, just called of the search🎉
Rest in peace, heroes.  We love you, and send thoughts of hope and healing to your loved ones. 💚
They died protecting Israel. Shame on the government
That sucks
Praying for the families... I'm so so sorry to see this and hear this ... Thank you Both for your service to this country!😭😭🙏🙏
Embarrassing
Biden betrayed them🤬🙈
How much you want to bet they are CIA assassins right now?
Massive respect and appreciation of our service members - absolutely NONE for Lloyd Austin
I believe if there's No Bodies, They're Not Dead!! Or They are in a Hospital without Memory of Their Names!!!
RIP Seals
So sad. Praying for their families.
Gut punch.  So hate to hear this.
🫡🇺🇲🙏
😢 Thank you for youre service and sacrifice  Praying for Gods comfort to both families
I thought seals were good swimmers.
Anybody really believe 2 seals fell off while boarding a small boat and couldn't be found? Nope
I would think that seals would be able to swim!
Two Missing Navy SEALs Declared Dead in Somalia and Joseph Stolen Hasn’t Said a Word About the Fallen Heroes…FJB!🖕🏾
As a Republican and proud NRA member, I prefer soldiers who don't go missing.
The pirate way of life usually leads to death. Avast ye skallywags!
Something stinks about that story .... They were boarding a ship with weapons ...
So sad
Disgusting that they  lost not one but TWO  SEALS
wow...
Maybe America needs to stop meddling in the affairs of other nations.
It is insane that Seals have no GPS units on their harnesses.
May they have great peace and know the gratitude the nation has for their service. And to their loved ones we share the loss.
God bless their souls 🙏
The gullibility in the comments is astounding lol
They have no idea how bad they've messed up.  Don't mess with our boats.
Strange.  SEALs are trained in 'drown-proofing'.  In the ocean, the SEAL will starve to death before they drown.  This double drowning of two SEALS smells fishy. 🐟🐟🐟
A gallant man of the sea gave up his life in an attempt to save a comrade. No greater love hath he who would give his life for another -- The Holy Scriptures. I salute them both. -- A USAF vet
thats an incomplete and suspicious resolution
Prayers to all. Thank you Sirs for your sacrifices and service in defending us and our country. My your families find comfort in your Honor and service to our nation. God bless. 🇺🇸🙏💔
Noooo!! 🥺💔
IT IS THE SOLDIER  It is the Soldier, not the minister Who has given us freedom of religion. It is the Soldier, not the reporter Who has given us freedom of press. It is the Soldier, not the poet Who has given us freedom of speech. It is the Soldier, not the campus organizer Who has given us freedom to protest. It is the Soldier, not the lawyer Who has given us the right to a fair trial. It is the Soldier, not the politician Who has given us the right to vote. It is the Soldier who salutes the flag, Who serves beneath the flag, And whose coffin is draped by the flag, Who allows the protester to burn the flag.
Sounds very suspicious. VERY.
AN OLD SOLDIER'S PRAYER  I have fought when others feared to serve. I have gone where others failed to go. I've lost friends in war and strife, Who valued Duty more than love of life. I have shared the comradeship of pain. I have searched the lands for men and women that we have lost. I have sons and daughters who served this land of liberty, Who would fight to see that other stricken lands are free. I have seen the weak forsake humanity. I have heard the traitors praise our enemy. I've seen challenged men and women become even bolder, I've seen the Duty, Honor, Sacrifice of the Soldier. Now I understand the meaning of our lives, The loss of comrades not so very long ago. So to you who have answered duties siren call, May God bless you my son, my daughter, may God bless you all.
THE CODE OF CONDUCT  I am an American fighting in the forces that guard my country and our way of life, I am prepared to give my life in their defense.  I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist.  If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.  If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information nor take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades.  If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way.  Should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies.  I will never forget that I am an American fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free.
2 Chronicles 7:14    “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”
Does admiral know how command operates negligently no back up
NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER’S (NCO) CREED  No one is more professional than I. I am a noncommissioned officer, a leader of Soldiers. As a noncommissioned officer, I realize that I am a member of a time honored corps, which is known as "The Backbone of the Army". I am proud of the Corps of noncommissioned officers and will at all times conduct myself so as to bring credit upon the Corps, the military service and my country regardless of the situation in which I find myself. I will not use my grade or position to attain pleasure, profit, or personal safety.  Competence is my watchword. My two basic responsibilities will always be uppermost in my mind—accomplishment of my mission and the welfare of my Soldiers. I will strive to remain technically and tactically proficient. I am aware of my role as a noncommissioned officer. I will fulfill my responsibilities inherent in that role. All Soldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership; I will provide that leadership. I know my Soldiers and I will always place their needs above my own. I will communicate consistently with my Soldiers and never leave them uninformed. I will be fair and impartial when recommending both rewards and punishment.  Officers of my unit will have maximum time to accomplish their duties; they will not have to accomplish mine. I will earn their respect and confidence as well as that of my Soldiers. I will be loyal to those with whom I serve; seniors, peers, and subordinates alike. I will exercise initiative by taking appropriate action in the absence of orders. I will not compromise my integrity, nor my moral courage. I will not forget, nor will I allow my comrades to forget that we are professionals, noncommissioned officers, leaders!
The nation should be grieving this tragic loss. Few can understand what this means.  2 Chronicles 7:14    “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”
Incredible 😔
You can thank Biden and his voters for this bullshit.  A holy war we shouldn’t even be in. Just truly pathetic. These brave men lost there lives due to a stolen election. Truly sad pathetic and disgusting. If trump was in office this never would of happened
Praying for peace for the family
RIP 🙏  thank you for your service and sacrifice 🙏 💔 ❤️
Don't climb on people's boats
This is what happens when you colonize other peoples' countries and waters- they defend themselves against you and sometimes you die. If you don't like the consequences of imperialism, don't do it then. U.S. military has no business being anywhere off of U.S. soil, ever.
This is totally weird. They act like they don’t know what happened. They know exactly what happened.
Our military should have some kind of censorship policy, can't help but feel like way too much of what's happening is being broadcast. Why don't we to ahead and pinpoint exact troop numbers, what radio frequencies were using and where we'll hit next while were at it! After all, we DESERVE transparency.....regardless of cost.
Did they get killed picking on peasants again?
Was going to say check air pockets of large debris
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🙏🏿✌🏾
Ugh this is awful
This is sad news.
Unfortunately, the men in question likely had several pounds of gear on. Swimming with such weight on you is exhausting, even with extensive SEAL training. May they rest in peace, America lost some of its best while our worst continue to govern us.
Wasn't the headline died in "Training accident" 10 days ago?
Sad news.  It's a loss to all of us.
Rip our fallen navy seals . Condolences to their families 😢😢🇺🇸🇺🇸So sad indeed.
They want to pull it they can afford to pay higher import tax.
And veitnam    and south Korea.   New Zealand.  There not the only ports on earth we can send are cargo ships to.  And increase the tarrif tax on the United nations for allowing it to occur for decades.
Never forget the ultimate sacrifice.  😢  RIP salute 🫡
How do you lose two navy seals? There was no way to recover them from the water?
Thank you for your service. RIP 😥
R I P.
Thank you for everything! We are grateful!
The crisis of competence has even reached the Seals. I'm starting to suspect Diversity is the strength they all told us it is
When can blockade trade by not docking at there ports.  And by restriction  on trade tell  there black markets. Funding it stops.      We got India. Philippines  Japan.  Australia  we can send are cargo ships to instead
Their blood is on Biden’s hands.
Why were there Americans in Somalia to begin with? Seems like they were looking for trouble and got it.
R.I.P. Two Brave Men!
The reason that they were there just doesn't add up, prayers for their families, the government sent them huh😢
died protecting corporate interests 🇺🇲🫡 remember the dead not the failed Audit and 3.8 trillion Dollars missing
Honestly if they haven't found a body  I cant say they are dead. The seals could still be alive out there, we just have to have faith.
When can hault all shipping lanes around around Africa an middle east  and. Send the ships to the Philippines  and Australian ports.    And to Japanese ports.     And completely cut off  there  trade.   By not docking at there ports  at all.
Stop the protocol of jumping in after.
Stinks to high heaven.. conveniently when Lloyd Austin is in the hospital, and we all know, JB couldn’t order his own happy meal.. JB and a coffee shop last week went up to a table and told the individuals within the coffee shop he was running for Senate in 2024 !? The corruption lies and cover up, needs to come out. Truth!
Seems a little weird to me. They know the second guy jumped off to save the first guy, but they don't know when they missing...  Hmm🤔
Thank you for your service. Condolences to their families and friends. 💐 🙏🏽
Ya will. Go overseas to protect other nations waters.  From acts of terrorism and ect but won't do it to stop cartels. Entering the United States water ways by boat or there drug boats.    in the gulf of Mexico.
No way I believe they died from drowning.
Lord bless there brave brave souls, I’m so sad for there familys an friends an the comrades it’s so sad , an i thank them for there services an brave protection for us all , God comfort all whom new them an loved them
Rip too the soldier's they did not do or deserve for this too happened and the fact that it did is terrible sad and pathetic there must be justice for the innocent my condolences for the familys
Likely died in a fire fight. Official story is a cover up.
How sad. Respect and condolences to their friends and family.  They gave their all.
I find it difficult to accept this news these guys don’t just drown
You are all idiots. Writing comments on here as if they or their families are going to read it. Get a life all of you.
John 15:13
Until Valhalla! Thank you for your service! RIP. 😥🇺🇸
May God, comfort your families.
That’s sad , shouldn’t they be able to set off some sort of beacon to be found in scenarios like these?
I’m sad 💔 RIP 🕊️🕊️my two wonderful heroes 🙏🇺🇸 My condolences to their Families
Where's proof they "fell over"
So sad, these two heroes sacrificed their lives for something a senile old man asked them to do and he didn’t know why!!
Truly sad. God bless them & families
Man i hope they didn't disappear them because they knew too much and were getting itchy
Did they actually drown ?  Both of them ? That is hard to believe. A terrible loss in ant event.
hey now if all planes have a black box that puts out signals under water why dont navy seals have a device on them that gives off signals if your lost at sea.
Hiluscinating CIA
Knowing a Navy Seal they may still turn up. Really sad to lose special people.
😂
Long Live, NO R.I.P. 🇺🇸🙏🏻
I knew it the second it was announced.  The ocean is huge.
What a group of bone heads.
God Bless you ❤️
Imagine how brave you have to be to jump into the dark abyss after your team member. RIP, you brave men.
My condolences to the families that lost these brave men at sea and cannot pay their final respects.
Terrible, we shouldn't even be there.
❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓
Nope.... the "official story" smells.
Weak men
Joe this happened because you!
R.I.P.
Thank you for you're service 🌹 💐 🌷 🇺🇸
So sad to think how very much our current admin doesn’t care about our military
So sorry for them and their families. Thank you for your service.
Father, I ask that you wrap your arms around Family and Friends of our Brother’s who were lost at sea.. Please talk to them and bring guidance into their lives with your Word.. Father, I ask that you please bring healing into their lives, healing from the hurt, pain, and sadness, healing from worry and anxiety, healing from depression and grief, healing from anything else that may bring harm to their body and homes.. Father, I ask that you please bring healing, comfort, and peace to their minds and hearts for their loss.. I ask that please remove the sadness and replace it with happiness, love, laughter and tears of joy for the memories made and for the memories they can make in Heaven.. Father, I ask that you please provide for any assistance or need’s that they may have and I ask that you please bring blessings into their lives so that they may be a blessing for others.. In Jesus name, I pray.. Amen!!!
Gud explain n distroy every day on USA soldier
Something about this story stinks.
I don't buy that story of 2 Navy SEALS drowning with assets on location 🤔. It sounds like a cover-up for Chinajoe 's good friends the Iranians. This is the ONLY logical explanation. 🛐🇺🇸
Prayers to the family 🙏🏽🕊️
May the Most High bless and comfort their families
More of a reason the US needs to stop interviening in foreign affairs.
Sure is tough to fight in every country, against every society.
...and then begin the payments for interference and intrusion.
How did this happen???
❤️🤍💙
BS  Drowned huh?  Seals drowned from overboard.  Something else happened
Oh dear God keep them close to you. In Jesus name I pray. 🙏🏼
Would you serve the biden administration and feel good about it.
Thank you for your service. I hope this doesn't happen again ever.
Declaration of death? Already? Missing in action maybe. But not dead. They actually are supposed to wait 7 years before they can do that.
Fair winds and calm seas, my brother's and fellow Shipmate. U.S.N..
Dead, on paper.  Hopes always there.🙏
Why is Joe Biden sending some of our best to a conflict that shouldn't even involve us?
I blame Biden for this. If Biden was taking care of business like he should, these seals would not have been out on this raid. It is sad and I pray for the Seals and their families.
🙏🙏🙏
Tragic. Thank you for your service 🫡
Training
😢 🙏🏼
Seems like every member of the military should have wearable tracking devices when they are out on missions.
RIP
God bless these brave men who lost their lives in the line of duty!!  God bless their loved ones.
Stop intruding in other countries lands and waterways.
Minding ones own business is paramount.
Why are our soldiers being put at risk for the Nutinyahoo regime??
So sorry for this tragedy
Why were they illegally boarding vessels?
I blame the decision makers on that one. Listen, they are SEALS in name only. Do you understand? They aren't actual seals.  Those soldiers are human beings and sending them out in the middle of the night during a storm was an incompetent decision.  Whoever sent them out bears the responsibility.  That person or persons should be reprimanded or fired from the job.   The USA needs all of our good soldiers, both males and females. We can't afford these kinds of losses!    May those precious souls rest in peace.   ❤️🕯🇺🇸🕯🇺🇸❤️
Were these SEALs on the USS Liberty?
So sad❤
This is what happens when you stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
Wasn't there a time when we would send a army to be the good guys in the world and fight evil. When did we become the evil.   They won't even save their killer buddies.....
😓🙏🕊️🕊️
Sure... sure...
Biden Administration is responsible for the lost of these brave Sailors!
Rest in peace brothers . fair winds following seas
Sorry to hear their loss
fish happy
Terrible loss.
RIP.
Slo jo getting our boys killed for what? Nothing
Joe biden should send hunter biden
The lost of men defending other’s is very difficult to accept my condolences too all
rip
Seals. Thank you for your service 🙏🙏condolences from Canada to their friends family and loved ones.❤❤
8 foot swells?? WTH, their mission should’ve been postponed, such a waste of two precious souls. So obviously, it was a covert mission. So tired of human caused tragedies. How many more times do we have to hear  “human error”?
I pray that their family members will be strengthened in the midst of their deep grief. I thank these men for their brave service, the likes of which we mere citizens will never know.
Already dead not injured first?
Bibi is the devil himself Revelations 2:9 Bidens support for these imposters of Yapeths bloodline are the root cause of this.  Promoting synagogue of Satan.  Revelations 2:9. While keeping us real Yasharalyah hidden ...we will not be silent!  Dueteronomy 28
RIP, and thank you for your service guys 😿🙏🏻
💔💔💔💔
Biden getting troops killed with a declaration of war.
Not dead until bodies are found.
West coast based Navy seals missing and Japan, USA, & Spain can’t find them?  They jumped in after What?? (21,000 sq. Miles were searched* = 13,440,000 Acres)
They’re not dead. They are Navy Seals. Search harder.
Sounds like two more Jason Bourne have been created. Not trying to be funny either.  Condolences to their families and friends.
My Deepest Condolences 💐 to the Families 🙏🏽
I wonder what really happened???
Never Forgotten 🇺🇸🙏
What if they are not dead and its secret mission the first story was bullshit..
Respect to the two brothers who served our great country well. Love and light to the families. 😢
That sucks! So waterproof GPS does not work or did these guys not have them..
Never give up
And what did they do on the other side of the world?
This is Biden fault. Weakness through appeasement to not address Iran directly.
The Ocean is not your friend
The body armour may have doomed them...its usually heavy.
🇺🇸🙏🏻🇺🇸
Keep searching.
So sorry to hear this. I have been praying for them to be rescued. May God bless their souls, and comfort and strengthen their families and fellow Seals.
Fair weather and following seas  Godspeed gentlemen
Rip you very bravern rest in the loving arms of God now😢
RIP
Rest in Peace. That was my biggest fear when I was a commercial shrimper. I almost fell over in rough seas. The boat rocked hard from a wave and I fell over the side. I was holding on and nobody knew what had happened. It was just me and the Captain. He was driving the boat. I was clinging to the side of the boat and had to climb back into the boat. It was during a northeaster storm while crossing an international shipping canal. Absolutely terrifying. My condolences to their friends and family.
😢 RIP and prayers for their families 🙏
Heart breaking .
Play stupid games will stupid prizes 👋😂👍
No greater sacrifice.. May their souls rest in the  greenest pastures of paradise. Salute to these brave men
Their families. 😢
A terrible loss that breaks my heart for these brave men and their families.
Don't believe the cover story.  They died in a firefight, but the government will not acknowledge it because it does not fit the current political narrative.
This admin has had to say this too many times. Respect and peace to the fallen  🙏
Ya think !
Two SEALs died in the same operation.  Just another "FIRST" for Joey and the Biden Cartel.
God bless and hold the seals family and team 🙏🏻
Thank you for your service. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 🇺🇸🇺🇸 ❤🤍💙
This whole thing makes me sick. I do not know the whole story, but it seems like our military let these brave men down and are responsible for their deaths. Words can not express my sorrow at the loss of these young warriors.
RIP God have mercy on there souls, and the souls of the jaded
My guess is they will likely show up on Don Shipley's channel with new faces and DD 214's.
R.I.P.
You need to work on your approach.
Would you jump in after your friend with a 99% chance you will probably drown?
Wow he jumped in to save his buddy! RIP NAVY SEALS
Zoguebots fed into the meatgrinder yet again, all for israel
😄
I have a question. Were they out there by themselves? Boarding ships to inspect for illicit weapons? Uh, no. Just another outrageous example of the lying government that’s in charge.
That is what those murderers get for being in the military. And how dumb is it that 2 navy Seals drowned. Like come on that is your only job lol
M.I.A probably most likely, K.I.A(sad no matter how you slice it. R.I.P)
For once, I hope conspiracy theories are right; hoping not dead but sheep dipped.....
They are built different.  RIP warriors.
I was in the army for a decade n saw both dessert storms so losing any comrade hurts .
But...were they found?
Iran will be as interested in recovering & identifying the remains. Perhaps even more interested. Two perhaps dead seals in Iranian contested waters is cover for a whole lot of above & below surface activity
This is horrible 😭😭
I don't trust them! I am not buying it that two navy seals drowned because of 8ft waves! Tell the truth!
Somehow, somewhere theres more to this story, don't you think?
My condolences to families and friends of these two Navy Seals, God bless you all and their souls.  They paid the biggest price for the Country they loved and may heavens gates open wide for them, thank you for your service and keeping The Constitutional Republic of America Free!!😢
thank you fore your service you will be dearly missed
Prayers for the surviving family.
More American blood, shed for Israel's wars that they created. They created Hamas to fight the PLO. Netanyahu gave them suitcases full of cash. He's on video in 2019 saying that Israel must continue funding Hamas but all the while, Israel had created the world's largest concentration camp in Gaza (listen to Professor Norman Finkelstein for the truth) and really wanted that land for themselves. There's half a trillion dollars of natural gas and oil there so, follow the money. And on Oct. 7th. Netanyahu ALLOWED the Hamas attack. He ignored warnings from Egypt and other countries that an attack was imminent. Netanyahu sacrificed his own citizens to do what he wanted to do all along. So, are the Houthis really the bad guys or, are they ALL bad guys? And so, Israel gets the U.S. to fund and fight wars from conflicts of which, they fan the flames. It's sad that our finest have to die for such bs.
They’re navy seals. They aren’t dead
*I mourn the loss of these brave warriors, and I ask the blessings of Heaven upon their surviving family, friends and loved ones.*   *I am offended by the ridiculous little “check-off box” I had to click before leaving the above comment. This platform becomes more juvenile by the day, I swear.*
Go easy brothers... RIP.
Navy seals get a 45 second clip on the news 😄😄😄😄🫣let taylor swif have a concert tho and that will be a 3 minute segment. This is disgusting
I don’t buy it.  I believe they are alive.  If anything, they’re in captivity and the captors are smart enough not to broadcast it online or the SEALs are still maneuvering through enemy territory.
RIP to my brothers at arms. We thank you for your service. ✊🏿💯
My deepest sympathies for their families, And Thank You for your Service. R.I.P.
I couldn't imagine dying for bidens agenda
bad guys over seas have to deal with seals. bad guys here get let go to do it again. 🇺🇸
😨😪😪😪
Our President, Joe Biden, needs to address this!  Lloyd Austin "released a statement"...from where, his hospital bed??  Is that supposed to be sincere?  How are we supposed to trust him, when he doesn't even feel the need to report to his boss??  This is insulting!  It's a slap in the face from the entire Biden Administration.
We need to just stop the craziness. We have lost enough people in the middle east to continue this trend.
What would they have them jump in 8 foot swells in the first place? I would never send my best in 8 foot swells without some kind of master plan. Our seals are soooo valuable to us! This is terrible. I’m so sad for their families. I can’t imaging what they were thing before they died. Especially the second one who jumped in to see his brother………😢
Either I’m having déjà vu or this happened about four or five days ago. Why are they covering? What is happened? An 045 days ago they’re late while they doing it now.
When was the last time Lloyd Austin was seen in public? 🤔
They signed up for it 🤷  maybe don't do the dirty deeds  for American warmongers
Mr. Austin, you didn’t thank them for their dedicated service for the length of time served. God bless these men and families.
This is the PROBLEM..Loss of LIFE of Americans in SOMALIA.. WE have NO BUSINESS THERE.. POLITICIANS & DEFENSE Contractors NEED to have THEIR CHILDREN ON THE FRONTLINE of PLACES WHERE ( WAR) hasn’t been DECLARED..ALL BEHIND ( CATERING) to the ISRAELIS and THEIR ( THIRST) for WAR, and OUR POLITICIANS NOT CARING WHAT THE AMERICAN CITIZENS WANT.. WHICH IS FOR OUR GOVERNMENT TO STOP GOING AROUND THE WORLD SEEKING ( CONFLICTS)!!!!!!
Prayers for them, their families, and their friends 🙏🙏🙏 may they be at peace!
They were on the wrong side of history!
Ritualistic classifying surgery as a means of psychic castration, like circumcision and sub-incision, are hallmarks of patriarchal culture, a demonstration to the young that the venerable old ones still wield the all-powerful knife - and the beginning of transsexualism. Those who do not perform the cult's rite can never enjoy full social status.  Symbols of the castrated member, the tie and bow-tie, are mandatory accoutrements of the political wardrobe and phallic monuments are erected to commemorate the minds conquered long ago. Brute force is no longer necessary.   The capitalist priest class of Psychiatry, working in tandem with the State bureaucracy, regulates and polices the new Restriction and gelding of desire. Psychiatrists, along with other legal arbiters, help to obscure justice with grey areas of intentionality, mental state, etc.   Some mistake this as a system of Liberty, ignorant of the fact that Psychiatric Control is a cornerstone of the perfected Totalitarian State.   All modern illnesses come from the absurd and tragic struggle of man's inability to bridle Nature. This dogma echoes perpetually, omnisciently by understanding voices in self-help books, billboards, radio commercials and television talk shows to convince the public to practice continual self-suppression and hormonal restraint. Any deviation is an indication of something severely wrong with the individual.   Perhaps Lycanthropic Transformation Rites are in some way a Psychic Preparation for the millennial calamities that are thought to lie ahead.   Malum In Se/Malum Prohibitum  Nothing moral requires authority. Authority is the claim to the exclusive exemption to morality. It is a monopoly on violence. Violence is a violation because it is the initiation of aggression, not self-defense. Offense/defense are ontologically distinct. All crime has a legal equivalent (ie, taxation is extortion).  Every government is founded on Ad Baculum.   Warren v. District of Columbia Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales DeShaney v. Winnebago County Lozito v. New York City  You are legally compelled via the logical fallacies Ad Populum, Ad Baculum and Ad Verecundiam to pay for protection that they are not legally obligated to provide. That's a mafia.  The highest Abrahamic value is Ignorance of Good and Evil. It's right there in Genesis. They worship Yaldabaoth, God of the Scapegoaters: God blames Man; Man blames Woman; Woman blames Serpent; Serpent blames God, more accurately - the Serpent defines God.   God Condones Child Rape No.s 31: 17-18  God Condones Rape Deut. 22: 28-29  God Condones Abortion No.s 5: 11-31  Unquestioning Obedience to Government Rom.s 13: 1-7  Legalism is a Language of Equivocations, a process of assimilation to violence and illogic.

"Everything is metamorphosed into its opposite to perpetuate itself in its expurgated form. All the powers, all the institutions speak of themselves through denial, in order to attempt, by simulating death, to escape their real death throes. [...] For example: it would be interesting to see whether the repressive apparatus would not react more violently to a simulated holdup than to a real holdup. Because the latter does nothing but disturb the order of things, the right to property, whereas the former attacks the reality principle itself." - Jean Baudrillard (Simulacra & Simulation - 1981)  "Our rulers, who rule our symbols, and so rule a symbolic class of life, impose their own infantilism on our instituitions, educational methods, and doctrines. This leads to maladjustment of the incoming generations which, being born into, are forced to develop under the un-natural (for man) semantic conditions imposed on them. In turn, they produce leaders afflicted with the old animalistic limitations. The vicious circle is completed; it results in a general state of human un-sanity, reflected again in our instituitions. And so it goes, on and on." - Alfred Korzybski (Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics - 1933)  "I am a cosmopolitan." - Diogenes  "If I could not be Alexander, I should wish to be Diogenes." - Alexander the Great  "A man is no less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years." - Lysander Spooner (No Treason: Constitution of No Authority - 1867)  "It is incredible how as soon as a people become subject, it promptly falls into such complete forgetfulness of its freedom that it can hardly be roused to the point of regaining it, obeying so easily and willingly that one is led to say that this people has not so much lost its liberty as won its enslavement." - Étienne de la Boétie (Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr'un - 1577)  "Leadership in government is political power, and political power is an official form of antagonizing the people. Politics are rules imposed upon the people. They have every man in a straight jacket and without a passport he cannot move a toe. In a free world, they violate the natural rights of every citizen.

F
We care so much.  God bless there family’s.  I was praying they would find them.
In my instinct and intuition, these guys were taken by sharks.
Does anybody actually believe this bogus excuse? Seals LIKE to drown... litterally just for funsies. Something feels fishy here.
Sad, but seems sketchy. Whatever became of the Iranian weapons?  Is Lloyd Austin back on post, and who did he report to since it wasn't Joe? Lack of transparency makes my mind more curious
So much for" never leave a man behind"
Dead or captured? I hope they are not somewhere being tortured. Praying for a miracle.
RIP ZOGBOTS.
It's unbelievable how Democrats can write off somebody's life so fast with no conscience. The definition of somebody with no conscience is a psychopath
They can't swim? They had no others present and were all alone at sea searching boats? Something's not adding up were being told. Why'd they have to search the entire ocean for them unless they were alone with no support in a rowboat. What's really going on and I don't wanna hear aliens abducted them unless they were illegal aliens.
Real men. Take a good look at them. Memory eternal. Thank you both!
Families should be suing the Biden government for sending their sons into an illegal war they he never got permission from Congress to fight.
Thank you to all who serve 🇺🇲
They're not dead they're part of some American government black Ops team if not they would have found their bodies already
Sad 😢, two more Great Patriots lost!
Thank you for your service,you paid the ultimate price.thank you for defending those who can't defend themselves.
But what if they are held captive somewhere? You might not know that. How can you declare them deceased it's not enough information
i don't think i can believe anything the liberal media  says anymore.
So sad, 🙏
So protocol is for 1 guy jumps in and everyone else looks?
🙏🏻🙏🏻
They may not be dead keep looking these are human lives not military equipment 🤬🤬
Salute to these men and condolences to their families. This wouldn't have happened if Trump were in office.  Never forget.  YouTube doesn't have an American flag.🎖🎖
😢🇺🇸🇺🇸💯
Seems like she is reading a script?
So very sad. I was hoping for a miracle. RIP fine warriors and gentlemen. ❤️🇺🇸
🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
We all knew that RIP
There's something "fishy" going on w this case
Rest in peace , thank you .
RIP fr 🕊. But that story sounds a little fishy. Litterally, no pun intended
😞
🙏 🙏 🙏
This has soooo many plot holes... what about the sailors on-board the ship? Did they not stick around to help? Being searched tells me they didn't want to stick around... also did they ever find them? As in the body's? Sure it's almost impossible to locate at sea but still.. seems sketchy through & through
I'm sorry.  We think of you as indestructible.  Thank you for your bravery.
😪😪😪😪😪😰
Tragic..RIP ❤🙏
The 2 were killed on Yemeni soil .
💐 💔
Fish food
Crazy he went in for his brother no matter the cost
I don't think he jumped in after his friend because of any so-called "protocol". He jumped in because that was his teammate. If "protocol" instructed that he not jump in, he'd still have jumped in. So stop saying it was protocol.
God bless you men for your service hope you are found to bring closer to your families.
THOSE GUYS HAVE TRACKING UNITS ON THEM  THEY DID NOT!!! GET LOST
Rest in Peace...🇺🇸🇺🇸
They aren't dead, they are on a mission and being declared dead is they're cover. I mean, if a man can swim the English channel on purpose, two Seals can swim the Med end to end.
I think the navy seals need to work on their protocol. I think he would’ve been more helpful on the ship instead of jumping in with the other guy.
I don't believe this story. How do you know what happened if their both missing?
Somebody needs to be losing their command over this!  This is absolutely BS.  You don't just "lose" two Navy SEALs.  My heart goes out to their families, and I will pray for two brothers who have been lost in the service of their country.
LLOYD AUSTIN Should be FIRED
🫂😩🥺😥😓😭
Austin is Defense Secretary of all other nations, not us.  Traiitor. My prayers for their families and friends!!!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Exactly why I got out, it’s cool to fight for your country and all but at the end of the day, who’s going to take care of your kids and family after they leave the “thank you for your service” comments? No one. It’s a stark reality that shows why there’s so many homeless veterans. Many folks don’t care the way they say.
They're officially black ops 100% now.... I'm sorry, SEALS don't just go missing, don't be FAKE NEWS!
True heros. May you RIP for your bravery and courage!
Omg this is awful. Many thanks for your service.
Thank you for your service gentlemen and my prayers for your families 🇺🇸
Semper fi
They don't have trackers on?
Why were they sent there? F Biden , should’ve been home.
They should have been at the border...they would probably still be alive.
Perfect way to infil a seal team
There needs to be better protocol for these water conditions. Now two are dead instead of one, who would have likely inevitably died with waves like that.
How sway…how
😢😢😢 deep condolences to the families and loved ones and friends!!
I knew when I read about this, that those guys probably drowned. Horrible. R.I.P fellas.
The only easy day was yesterday. RIP brave sailors 🧭🔱🌊
I wouldn't count them out as yet, they are well trained to handle these conditions, whose to say that this isn't how they were supposed to start their mission covertly. What they had to pretend this tragically happened so their targets would believe they are deceased and they would be able to move much more easily
The best and bravest......so tragic
What did they know about Epstein ?
They for sent off by the US military on a pure suicide mission
Are they saying 2 navy seals who go through rigorous training and in swimming and surviving in water? Somehow drowned?
Noooo, terrible loss.
R.I.P. Sailors
Thank you for your brave service and noble sacrifice for our country.
Godspeed to our Brothers, I wish for your peace , and comfort to your families .💝❤️‍🩹🌹
21 thousand square miles. They sank boys. Directly down below the ship during the operation. Died within seconds of falling in if its deep enough. No flotation used during these missions is highly questionable. Mustang makes a 0 profile inflatable pull belt etc. No reason not to have some level of maritime protection.
Tell the truth because this isn't it.
RIP Seals we know who to blame 😤
😢😢😢
I am sorry for the families loss. I would like to thank these seals for service/dedication to our country to keep us safe. I pray for their grief and loss and that they know how many citizens value them and all those who have supported them.
To all and every soldier past and present I salute you.
yeah, they totally drowned II
Very sad. Thank you for their service. Condolences to their families.
God bless these soldiers that put their life on the line for America! 😢
Oh I’m so sorry 😞
Karma for Nordstream.
Smells like a Clancy novel.
Why did Joe Biden fund terrorist attacks by eliminating President Trump's Iran sanctions?
If there was only two and both went missing, how do we know what happened? Am I missing something?
Stop Antagonizing Iran!!! Jackasses! If we would stop antagonizing then they would stop hating us dummies.
Rip . Thank you to both and their families.  God Bless Them and God Bless America
We need Trump back. How many more will die b/c of Joe, the big traitor guy.
😢
Smells 🐟
Why were they there in the first place?
Who cares
Leave no man behind unless you're the government, then they don't care
I thought Austin was missing. I get mixed up sometimes.
My heart goes out to the two men who are now in the arms of their best company. Their shouts will always be heard across the world.
If I had to bet on SEALs or Joetater, I bet SEALs.  If Joetater says they're dead, they are probably alive.  If they were confirmed dead, they would announce names.  The lazy WH just wants people to stop asking about them.
Reading these comments feels like I’m getting into peoples head cannon for some movie they think the world is… Granted, it’s completely reasonable to not buy the official story, but it’s also completely reasonable to buy it given all the resources that were put into this search.. Yes, we deal with lies, and yes, c0nspir@cy happens, but actually think out the logistics and the logic of things a few extra steps and you might come to find sometimes a duck is a duck, and there’s nothing to see here.. But being in a movie is funner, I get it.
: (
😢😢😢. RIP thank you for your service
I'm heartbroken for these two brave men and I am praying for their families. Valhalla has two new warriors and our world is a little less protected.
did the gps fail on both of them?
All becuase Biden can't stop supporting genocide
And, this is how you take two outstanding military men and move them into black ops
OR they’ve been recruited into black ops super soldiers.
Why are my tax payer dollars in Somali right now? Why are my tax payer dollars in Israel and Ukraine? Why are my tax payer dollars going to all these foreign countries and a military industry that is unconstitutional?   Terrible and heartbreaking news to hear that fellow human beings died but my goodness people wake up!   We have a country of our own that is falling and we are investing in all these foreign wars?!
2 Navy Seals drowned? How?
Rip warriors
Sacrificed for Israel
🇺🇸 You served your country with Excellence 🙏🏾
R.I.P. to my fellow American sailors. 🇺🇸🫡
Thank you for men like this who volunteer for their calling. The way this country has gone so disgustingly feminine, I, for one,  appreciate that nature still produces actual real men.
I hear sharks love eating seals 🤷
More American deaths because of the horrible Biden admin's policies. Biden has to go now!
🚩🚩
Was PETA informed about this????  That is cruelty to animals.
Two brave men.  Too bad they have to have a Lloyd Austin remark as their tribute.
😪
Trump said they are only war heroes if they get caught
100% Biden fault, Mr Potato Head can't even have the guts to talk about it.
OH my... L-RD comfort their families... and may they rest in peace 🙏...
Rip. Prayers and condolences.
RIP
Never would have been there to begin with if Trump was in office...
whoever believes this seal fell into the water is ludacris
Onto a new darker life…
Give billions to these military families not Ukraine
May the families understand that these missing men have been reaasigned. God bless.
Dang.... Dang dang dang.
good maybe next time stop sticking ur nose in the middle east
Sad to hear, but they should have been home with their families.
Trump has no idea what it means to serve !
Two elite soldiers goes missing near the Red Sea where tensions are high. If I wanted intel on a country in complete darkness you send a trained assassin, if you wanted to take out bad guys with 0 repercussions you send 2. I hope they are ok but my senses are telling me otherwise.
Surely it wasn’t just them, where was the rest of the team? Did they abort or continue to board? No flotation devices, dye packs, strobes, gps, WHISTLES… nothing?
God bless them all, and may God bring peace and healing to their families.    I pay no attention to LLoyd Austin.
🤔
RIP BOZOs
Loosing Navy Seals is an immense loss. They are some of the most badass people on the planet. They are rare. They dont just come a dime a dozen.
Real ones 🫡
😓🕊️
Sounds like they got into a scuffle and a few were KIA .. but they won’t tell you that with how the world is going
suspicious
Not sure what to think. SEALs..lost in the ocean, some of the highest trained soliders out there?
Prayers For Those Brave Men
Thank you for your service.  RIP
And this is how you get black budget army mercenaries who can go in and do things not necessarily by the books. This is how you get military “ghosts”.
They were the best of us.   Superhumans in every way.    RIP
Sad 😢
There are too many loose ends to this story.  First Lloyd Austin is a documented liar. Spokesman Kirby heaps on an even higher pile of lies so who can believe any statement? They would have had IR flashlights with them.  They had team radios.  10 years ago when they were going after Bin Laden, they had live feed in the White House.  No drone coverage?  The rumors will probably begin to circulate soon and you will be told that it is conspiracy theory, then it will be “unproven” then it will be “true but it has been well known for months..,,”
What a valiant way to go - these guys are incredible. Some talk about brotherhood but others live it. Rest in peace.
Yu know Note8 button cost about a dollar, how fkn hard was that?
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Better make sure that the Hootsies didn't'pick them up! Captured
Prayers for family of these two brave hearts. May lord give them peace
Best way to thank them is to stop voting demonrat.
They were dead the day they got shot trying to board the ship.  All the rest is propaganda to make american military seem heroic. One jumped into the 8 foot swells to save the other one because of protocol?....... Was the rest of the assault on the ship a success? American mass media is complicit in using narratives that favor american imperialism.
Fair Winds and Following Seas
God is watching over them
Awful 😖
My heart is with their families.  God bless.
Remember the US liberty and Isreal getting away with 911.
Or they are POW
so is the fake news
I guess they did not have an emergency GPS tracker …I want a investigation!!!! never make this mistake twice😢
My wife was in the Navy.. rip to all
Indonesia did it!
They can put a chip in a brain, but they don’t have enough brains to have an emergency beacon for each person when turned on are we talking about pathetic or what??? can someone please tell somebody to install these
something dont feel right   but it is a short video
As far as I know, not a word from Biden.
RIP
How did these heroes not have flashing beacons attached to their outfits that only our military could see just for this situation.  Very 😢 sad
RIP mates.
Thx Bidum, we have no business being there.........
They had no business being there in the first place
Prayers for peace and healing for their families and loved ones.  Thank you for your service and loyalty to our country and your fellow comrades.
Did they hire DEI people to find them?
Thank them for their services and sacrifice 🙏
Prayers and condolences RIP 😢my deepest sympathy 🙏
RIP BOZO
I bet Biden blamed Trump for this.
I once asked a navy seal how do you dog paddle in the wide open ocean and he said to float on your back to conserve energy
Biden kills two more 👎🏿
HOW???? just a crime on the part of the military.
Who are they? What are their names.
Rip 😢
God Bless the families of these brave men and their Navy Seal family as well.
We can not send our American citizens to die for other countries causes this is all the Biden administration fault. They are killing our Americans and replacing us with illegal imigrants. Vote for Trump 2024.
This old Army veteran is in mourning.
R.I.P. Warriors.
Bunch of morons....
