Imagine reporting your superiors😂😂
😂😂😂
Its an NRM rogue government causing this ,taking other forces us superior and others as inferior . The SFC ,UPDF is fool of S4 school drop outs fuelled by NRM rogue government . You find SFC they have no reasoning at all their brains are totally fool of pouriage ,they only train bodies no brain training at all ,that is why you see too much shooting on civilians ,and the army is seen us an enemy to citizens . Seen in kawempe elections if some one is Educated ,someone can know what is meant by acting professionaly ,now this army knows that acting proffessionaly is beating,shooting,shouting etc what a shame to Ugandan army ,see Isreal army and you will love the army ,USA army ,you will love the army but here in Uganda because of a rogue government it will also have rogue forces to keep it in power ,how can you say that you are not a dictator with such brutal forces around you 😊😅
Military is taught no mercy.. if you have ever attended any of their bootcamps you will know those guys don't joke when an order is made..

The meaning of we're in one boat 🚢
Now how about other powerless local Ugandans 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oba Alien nga ba Fangone
Y did they arrest the commanders
But why should the Uganda People's Defense Forces attack and brutalize the Uganda Police Force. Has the UPDF moved away from being a non partizan army, Is the UPDF now a personal army, is the UPDF still the People's Defense Forces.  Everything is vividly clear, so many things are going on in our beloved country and it is so sad that the government in power has chosen the path of violence and injustice. The government itself is steadily laying a foundation for future political instabilities. We pray that the UPDF gets back to its right track of being the Uganda People's Defense Forces rather than being a personal and partizan army.🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kineke
It means police arrested military commander then kiboko nevuga

The bogus country of uganda created by the british in 1962 , created havoc for us , there was no country called uganda,  there was a country called Buganda ( the owners) . But today we have a bogus state called uganda , this bogus uganda has no land, no territory,  and no income.  This is not a country , became its not.
System yoona yaffa in NubianLi's voice😢
Mbu Uganda is safe, Mwekube hope you have u passed through the same pain that you put on civilian. UGANDA Olemwa

😂😂😂😂 naye banange police where are you lol
LET THE POLICE TOO TEST THE BRUTALITY OF THE DICTATOR.
In a country of lawlessness, anything can happen. That is the definition of M7 and his ideology(NRM).  In countries led by right thinking people, such nonsense can't happen.
😅😅😅😅😅  mukama😂 but sad
Police should report them to police 😮
This is the best story in 2025 we have been reporting to police about abductions and they always said we are in politics namwe kamufune ku mbooko za JAATT 😂😂
"Bakubye OC Tugenda !" 😢
Police men are corrupt thanks alot UPDF
😅😅😅😅😅
We don't care
Who on earth thought it was a brilliant idea to assemble these masked squads in the army for such delightful acts of cruelty?  M7's future looks as bright as a black hole if he doesn't rein in this indiscipline.  I can just picture it now—rebel groups popping up like mushrooms after a rain, or the army sections deciding to take a little diversion, all while pretending they're just trying to soothe the nation's jitters.  <text.This is a game where nobody walks away with a trophy.  I trust the masterminds of this impunity are fully aware of their grand performance.  They'll certainly feel the heat as well.  Ah, but it seems M7 has lost the reins, hasn't he?  Before the situation takes a turn for the worse, let's stage a little coup, shall we?
Mbu kati ffe ekyatukubiiza oba lwakuuba tutudde awo tulaaba 🫩🫩
