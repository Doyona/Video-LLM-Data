Would love to see a birth stories video! I’m a new mum and love hearing everyone’s stories!
Thank you for the great content!
She’s backkkkk…. And the new look is GORGEOUS✨
Always so positive and inspiring ! ❤️ would love to see your video on both births😊
It would be helpful for a birthday video as someone who is terrified of pregnancy and birth to the point it's making me not have children
Valentine’s Day, wedding plans, home makeover, and... baby #3? Are you playing life on HARD mode? 😆 Wishing you luck and make sure to stay healthy—this level is intense! 😆
Great video ❤❤❤
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
The start of the vlog was sooo wholesome, you guys are the cutest. Looks like the cutest home video ever.
Hi Zoe, would you be able to please do a spring clothing haul!? PS… you are stunning!
i am IN LOVE with the hair!!
Birth stories!! Absolutely
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
This was super helpful, thanks!
I’d actually love to hear about your births! I’ve had 2 so different and unique ones, it’s lovely to hear other people’s experiences! X
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Loved this vlog ❤
I’m currently pregnant with my first baby!! I would love a video about your delivery experiences because my anxiety about giving birth is starting to kick in😂🤍
I littraly screamed and hubby asked y and I said we have a new zoe vlog yay made my day xxx loves the new hair and the braces arnt noticeable to us xxx
Yes please do a birth comparison video 😊
I am so excited. I have been wanting braces for years now again and also had braces before. Been putting it off for years because it was never the right time, however seeing you do it as well has also given me courage to do it :))
SHE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE MEREDITH GREY from Greys anatomy 😍🥹❤️🩷
Still visiting Boho Gelato every time I’m visiting Brighton - Iconic one and amazing ice cream ❤
My baby wouldn't come out so had to have forceps and I could barely walk and when I got in the car I caught my stitches 😂
Their children are very cute and beautiful.❤
YES! DO A BLOODY VIDOE ON THE BIRTHS!!! IVE ONLY BEEN ASKING FOR 4 YEARS!!!!!!
I always imagined myself with two little girls but got a boy instead and it‘s the best. I don‘t get why everyone wants girls nowadays because it doesn‘t matter! you are gonna love your child regardless of gender. 🩵🤍🩷
The gesture Alfie does around 5:30 is a very rude gesture in Turkey. I'm just writing to say it was hilarious seeing Alfie do it so calm 😆
You look so beautiful Zoe ♥️
17:27 I am currently in this as well, recently lost a best friend because she can't relate to mum life and why I don't do much outside of that, finding my identity a very confusing topic atm.
I know it’s just a small little moment, but it meant so much to me. When Ottie accidentally spilled some flour while making pancakes, Zoe just laughed without a second thought. It brought so much joy and relief to my inner child to see parents today reacting like this—showing that there’s nothing scary about a little mess. Kids should know that. I wish I had known that, too. It’s beautiful to see a world where mistakes are met with laughter instead of fear.
I loveee your hair zoe!! ❤️
So happy to see you so grown, mature and beautiful. I’ve been watching you since my teenage years. Now your videos help me so much to relax and enjoy some free time after work. Thank you ❤
😍😍😍
wdym Novie can walk now 😭
You and Alfie are 100% girl mom and girl dad.    Joe and Dianne give boy parent vibes - so maybe Ottie and Novie will have boy cousins
It's so nice to hear someone else say their planned c sections were a much better recovery to their natural births. My first birth was horrendous. I couldn't sit down properly for nearly 3 months due to my stitches and 11 years later I still get some pain. With me next 2 I chose sections and I was back to myself nearly 2 weeks later!!! Best decisions I ever made!! ❤
Oh my goodness, i remember in my childhood the groovy chick magazines. ❤ Thank you for this, trip down memory lane hehe
Me watching this pregnant and I wish you guys have more children because you are great with your kids and I love how they are turning out - I know it’s not all on camera but how you are with them is really showing especially on Ottie - she is curious and smart and her vocabulary is amazing.   ❤️
Big fan of the new hair
Can I just say the older you get you get more beautiful idk how that possible but you truly are aging like fine wine 😊❤
Absolutely loving the new hair it's suits you and your face shape so much ❤️
I’m a January woman. Born on the 23th. For me it is a sad month but if you see it as a month to relax and cocoon at home it’s a good one.
My first is the exact same as Ottie and my youngest (they’re both around the same age) is like Novie, I call it first and second child syndrome 🤣🤣
Omg Zoe and pod cast The Suggs we neeeed it
I think Joe and dot will have a boy so Zoe you will get your boy that way .love the hair Zoe looks beautiful
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Yay welcome back ❤ excited for spring vlogs. You look absolutely gorgeous btw 😍
This was very informative, appreciate it.
I don’t know if anyone from Ukraine is watching this but I have been a constant viewer since 2015-16 I think. And now with the w@r in Ukraine and horrific things happening your videos bring colour and comfort to my life❤ thank you💫
Amazing content as always!
Ya look stunning
I couldn’t picture my husband and I with a boy either after two girls. I was certain the third was going to be a girl and it turned out to be a boy! The girls were so excited and they adore him. I could totally see you guys with a little boy.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
i second the joe and zoe podcast because it would feel like a vlog but just talking about what you did that week/day and it would be so nice because i love when both of ya'll rant or go on tangents and your voices are quite calming to me could fall asleep to the podcast NOT GONNA LIE!
Zooooo you are looking so beautiful glowing!!!!💛💛💛
Been watching her for over a decade, and she can always surprise me, that she can even look better. Love the cut.
I absolutely love your hair! It looks gorgeous! Always adore your videos.
I was waiting to see you again.
You look SO good with this new hair. WOW you are so beautiful!!!
yayy!! you're back
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
You look beautiful! Sabrina carpenter esq look when sitting and chatting!
I don't know why but Zoe's eyes look extra stunning and mesmerizing in this video, like, she is definitely gorgeous 😍
the gelato brought me so back. i perked up like i remember!!!!
I LOVE THIS HAIR
i always wanted two children. Had my first with no trouble. Ended up miscarrying with my second and have been diagnosed with unexplained infertility. I guess the world decided I was done haha. Theres always the IVF route but money etc.. Its really made me appreciate how lucky I was to have my daughter.
Ok but the braces are so cute. I looked terrible in mine 😂
May I just say, you've always looked beautiful but rn you look MORE STUNNING THAN EVER✨️✨️✨️❤
I love your new hair style!
The clock shows 2024
A Zoe vlog was just what I needed today ❤
You look so grown up now 😍😍😍😍😍
you’ve created the most gorgeous lil family ❤
the braces are such a vibe i genuinely think theyre such a cool accessory lol. i never had the chance to get braces unfortunately lol
Would love to hear the story and details and how you coped and what was hard. I am not of child bearing age but know that many women would learn a lot from your experience and also just find it interesting.  I always find out how women got thru and what various changes and challenges happened thru the delivery and post partum recovery. A lot of people are squeamish face to face but truly would be interested and appreciate the story and being assured that despite the harder delivery that you did make it thru and were okay. ❤
Ah sorry to hear was a rough recovery...I  had a long labour and eventual vaccum retrieval (with episiotomy) with my first as well! But for me so lucky the recovery was v smooth and easy. My only complication was weird unexpected nerve damage (despite not having epidural) I think from the extended pushing on my back / where she was stuck. Second time around defs aiming for another vaginal birth, and luckily this time can be more midwife lead, hoping will be quicker and easier and I'll have more freedom to move around and push in my preferred position and fingers crossed they'll come out all on their own 😛
This was super helpful, thanks!
GROOVY CHICK MAGAZINES omg I haven't seen those in years!!!!!! They were my favourite, I had a Make It Groovy cushion on my bed and my first email address had 'groovygirl' in it 😭
I think it’s so interesting seeing how different novie is from my own daughter who is around the same age. They develop personalities so early! I’ll see novie cuddle up to you and think “Wow, my daughter would be thrashing to get away” 😂 She is not a cuddler lol
Yes! And ppl set themselves up for failure so much if want a particular sex of baby. So valid of course but so much gender disappointment out there. I'm pregnant with my second and I do think/envisage it being a boy so if its another girl I will be abit taken aback initially, but also the idea of having sisters is so so special. Idk I guess I just have this (silly) idea of it being easier for the kiddos to be Different if they are different in sex but obvs regardless each child will be their own individual and likely so different from each other.
It sounds like you should invest in a wedding planner!
not a regular commenter- but you look so pretty Zoe! Might be strange to say but the braces actually quite suit you! I guess they tend to make lips plumper or something haha. Lots of love to you and your family.
It does feel like Ages!
You and Joe need to film together more! No podcast necessary
Silent watcher here, your makeup looks amazing you look like you're in the middle of summer.
What is this Camera?
Your new hair reminds me of the 90s disco vibes love it! Also been watching you for over 10 years now and it’s amazing how far you have come, also would love to hear your birth stories and the podcast idea would be so good! I would defo tune in to watch, the conversations would be hilarious.❤😂
Omg the groovy chick magazines are such a theowback for me, I use to be obsessed with groovy chick when I was younger and use to get the magazines ❤
novie sounds like such a sagittarius lol
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Love love love your new hair!!!
Zoe, long bob haircut .. I'm telling you. it would look perfect.
Yes please do birth stories! Also cannot imagine how irritating it is to constantly have people ask if you’re having another baby. People were asking my friend that question within a month of her giving birth.
My brain felt so confused when I saw you first… I was like what is different?! Your hair! It looks so good! ❤
Your vlogs are so cute cosy and lovely! Thank you for sharing ❤ xx from Oakhill Cottage
Novie is a cat and Otti a golden retriever ❤
Please film your process of making the Sweet Pea Teepee! I'd love to see how you do it so that I can do the same. Thanks!!
❤ this!
OMG A PODCAST WITH MARK?!!!!
yes to the birth video! im a student midwife and would love to hear your experience!
April is the real new year anyway. I love spring ❤ also you are looking radiant
Another lovely Vlog.  I love Chocolate Malted Milk Biscuits.  I have had Dark Chocolate ones in the past but can’t find them now.  I’m waiting for White Lotus new series Episode 2 and onwards👏👏👏❤️🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
I’ve never ever ever commented before, but I’ve watched you for years. I just wanted to sort of thank you, because I have just finished my second set of fixed braces and your vlogust got me through having double jaw realignment surgery, I had it one the 12th of August and I got to stay home and watch you guys every evening whilst everyone else got to have dinner.   Having a second set of braces in adulthood really cements the teeth cleaning routine and the importance of having the retainer! Thank you for the distraction in my recovery and thank you for showing others that fixed braces aren’t just for teenagers. I’m 25 and I had the braces on for four years up until 2 weeks ago. You’ll get used to it and it is worth it x
I would love it if you and joe did a popcast together! 😊
Zoe, your vlogs are like a big hug! ✨💌 🫂
You explained this so well, thank you!
Sunday sorted wow
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
I have 2 boys and I feel the same...I just can't imagine having a girl.  And I don't think if I were to have more children I would ever have a girl.
Good to see you back with a new vlog.💚
You have just described the personalities of my two. I wonder if it's a second child thing 😂
Very well done, appreciate this video!
I have two daughters too, 10 & 8 and I still feel lost and not myself. I can’t even remember who I used to be before children 😢 Do we ever find ourselves again? 💔
This was super helpful, thanks!
Hello zoe! Could you please let is know where you got your ‘Z’ charm necklace from?
Not me tripping out that the calendar still says 2024 😂
Great job, this video was very useful!
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
You look beautiful Zoe :-)
Oh how ive missed u zoe welcome back ❤❤❤❤
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
“I see a lot of me as a child in Ottie, but with Novie, I’m a bit more like ‘who are you like?’” Then goes off describing Novie with the traits of Alfie hahahaha determined, adventurous, daring, confident, rolling day to day
Would be so funny if the “I can’t picture a boy in our family” would become the new “We’d be disgustinnnnn” 😂😂
Erm.Hair goals 😍 don't normally comment but Zoe ( if even possible) looks more beautiful than ever ❤ xx
I have Invisalign and just this week had ONE tooth wrapped with some wire and bands becasue it needs to rotate 20%. I hate it so much 😂 I also had braces as a child. I hope all works out!!!
I feel like the roles could turn and Alfie would be great at planning a wedding!!
Your girls are getting so big.  They are so adorable, love the walks.
Sacroiliac pain is not to be messed with. I did mine in after a fall but never reported the pain till years later and now I have a chronic pain condition. Such a good job you were able to get it sorted out. 😅
please please do a video on your births! my first was an emergency C section and my recovery has been so difficult and I feel its only just healed 8 months later. was thinking of going natural next time if possible to prevent this but would love your thoughts! x
This new hair and makeup looks so good on her. I'm loving her whole look and style right now
I’d love to watch a video where you compare/ tell your birth stories! I have a six month old boy and his birth did not go to plan. I’m very into hearing birth stories because it helps me not feel so alone.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
You explained this so well, thank you!
oh wow, do you look GOOD Zoe!  glad the fam is doing all well! ❤
Guyssss, doesn’t Zoe look like Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey) in the thumbnail!?!? Is it just meeee????
Missed Zoe’s vlogs so much! Welcome back m’love!💞
HAIR LOOKS AMAZING
I missed you guys 😭😭
The groovy chicks magazines!! I was obsessed with those!!
She’s back❤❤ What is your pancake recipe please Love all the flowers.
You explained exactly I feel. About being myself again. I got good at it while my daughter was 3/4 but now she is 9 I feel I'm in mum mode during all my free time. Thankyou for saying that I hadn't considered it and I think it's why I'm feeling so blegh too. X
Yay your back ❤
Yes i would love a video of you talking about the births!
I love your new hair Zoe it really suits your new style I can’t wait for your wedding vlog and your next newborn baby honestly I am so excited for you and your family ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🥰🥰🥰
Novie is definitely giving second child vibes!! That’s exactly what my little boys are like. The youngest child normally are more independent and feisty knowing their own mind! She will be a fantastic little toddler
that hair I thought it was your Mum
100 percent please do birth discussion
I missed you so much Zoe, thanks for filming that❤
Perfect timing 🤍🤍🤍
Hair looks gorgeous!!
A Zoe Podcast will be so good ✨
Birth videos please!
I'm 4 months post partum and I could cry ... you just described the exact same pain that I am still experiencing 4 months after giving birth. Investigated broken coccyx (negative), so I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for this week! The excruciating pain you described is exactly how I am experiencing it. Thank you!!
Love to see a video where go more indepth about the births. Thanks for sharing ❤
Always appreciate a Zoe Sugg vlog ❤
I have to say it, the new haircut makes you look so much like Jen Aniston, gorgeous! ❤
A podcast with you and Joe is a great shout.  Love you include your girls on velentine's day - my Dad used to buy me yellow roses every year (my favourite from when I was a child)
you can ramble you should make an uncut channel for less edited content I will listen to it!
The question about how to find yourself again when you don't know who you are anymore hit so hard. 2 years ago I ended a 12 year relationship. We were together all of my 20's and I feel so lost now at 35. I lost myself at the end of that relationship and now I don't know who I am anymore. I am alone, no kids and just feel really lost. But I am taking small steps in finding myself again, trying to see it in a more positive way. Like you said just trying to do things I know I enjoy and try new things. Decorate my home as I want it without having to think about someone elses opinions. Yeah just taking it slow and small steps at a time.
This little family and their vlogs honestly make me so happy☺
Clock still thinks it's 2024! xx
Yes please do a birth stories video!! Just had my first baby and I was binging all your baby content!
Zoe, I am VERY happy to see new video!!! Thank you!! As for the births video, I personally would like to watch it if you to film it just because I like this sort of content ❤
zoe i absolutely adore you & your vlogs. such serenity and unwinding to my day makes me feel like im eating my fav comfort food lol, love you lots
The way Alfie looks at you is so adorable, so glad you’re back 🩷🩷
It's nice hearing that the C-section could be a better experience than normal delivery. Most of the time, they say that normal delivery is way easier recovery.
Would love to hear all about your journey about being a mom until now ❤ from being pregnant the first time to the differences at the second time and now having two little sisters ☺️
Get a wedding planners. They can do everything, you can just agree it :)
So excited ♥️🩷
i think you need a wedding planner
Thanks for sharing intimate snippets of your birth and recovery experience, that was very vulnerable and so powerful. Sending love <3
please do a video on birth! im 25 and not a mum but i am thinking about it and the thing scaring me most is birth
i would absolutely love a video speaking on your birth experiences if that’s something you’d be comfortable sharing! I think pregnancy/ birth/ postpartum is so distorted for women bc of false perceptions in media and people sharing their honest experiences is so so important for how we view and approach it ! 💞💞💞🙌🏻
Please please please do video talking about the births!!! 🥰
Yay vlog! My kitten just passed away this week so this is a really nice treat :) Thank you Zoe!
Your hair is so beautiful, bangs suit you so much ❤❤
Zoe you look so fresh, young and radient <3
I needed this today
get a wedding planner, they'll do most of the work for you, you give them what you envision and they'll turn it into reality
I was about to tidy the kitchen then I saw the notification for your vid and thought it was a sign to sit down a little longer 😊 hehe You guys looked so adorable for Valentines matching pj's breakfast ❤ Loved an Alfie and your vlogs this Sunday morning to start my day off.. Take care lovely lady, ps your hair so pretty 😊  Right let's go clean my kitchen, no more excuses 😂  Happy Sunday xx
The way you were explaining the differences between Ottie and Novie really reminded me of the dynamic between me and my sister. We are 2 years apart and all throughout our childhood and now early 20’s my younger sister has always been the more independent, headfirst , confident and determined one and i genuinely think it is such a big sister/ little sister dynamic to have!
Every time you had a baby I just felt it would be a girl. Can't picture a boy either!
Welcome back Zoe, we've missed you ! You look gorgeous 🤎
Literally dropped everything and sat down to watch, I’m so excited❤️
Having a daughter is like having your forever best friend and having a boy is like having your last love😊
Could you do a video on your routine and how you get the girls to sleep please? ❤
Getting the notification for your first vlog of the year is the best feeling 💗 You should get a wedding planner! If I had the funds I would have!! You can tell them your vision and they can do all the hard work 😂 Wedding planning is no joke honestly
I remember collecting these groovy chick magazines! I always remember it came with a big purple bag 😂
Zoe here just looks so differentttt in a good way but I can’t point out what it is🤣   Maybe it’s the hair making her face look fuller? 😍😍😍😍  sooooooo prettyyyyy
Zoe you should swap your dining and play rooms! The dining room is close to the kitchen (for siupervision) and would be a great play room with a side door for the kiddies to leave their little bikes outside. And the room off your lounge is the perfect entertaining space for a big dining table to host Christmas etc ❤
Zoe looks so beautiful 😊
Are the personality traits a 1st child and 2nd child thing? Like are you the older child? Is Novi more like Joe as a second child?
Does anyone know where Zoe’s Z initial necklace is from? 🫶🏼
Need that lip colour please! 👄
Its interesting, you are describing Novie just with characteristics like her dad Alfie 😁, but you dont realise
Zoe !!! You are GLOWING 😍 so happy to see you back
thats not true. You can do things to increase the chance of getting a boy. old wives tales are a real thing
Vlog is back!🎉🎉
I was so desperate for my first child to be a boy, and then we had a girl. We then loved having her so much that when we found out our second was a boy I was actually so taken back and it took me so long to come to terms with! Obviously we are super lucky to have one of each and we love the dynamic but I think when you have a girl first it’s then really hard to even comprehend having a boy, and vice-versa x
Would love in depth birth stories please! I'm a mum so love relating !
I really love the vlog style of this vlog. Adoring the bangs and braces. Nothing makes me run to YouTube quicker than a Zoe vlog
Please please please do a full c section video! I’m a FTM due in June and I have to have a C section which is grand but I’d love to hear your experience ?
Yayayyayayayyyayay
PERFECT SUNDAY! ❤ always love watching your videos makes me feel so happy❤ you look so beautiful 😍xx
New hair 🎉
i neeeed a hair tutorial i am obsessed with it!
Why don’t you get a wedding mood board on the go and then speak to a wedding planner Zoe 🥰
You describing Novie and Ottie is literally me and my older sister. My sister is very caring, she is a paediatric  nurse working in a hospital and I have just graduated with a musical theatre degree. I’m definitely more spontaneous and outgoing as well. It’s a first child and second child thing I think 😂😂
Your hair looks amazing.xx💕
I've seen a few comments mentioning the new hair is giving Jennifer Aniston (I see it) but for some reason my brain is thinking Ellen Pompeo and that somehow it makes you kinda look like her? Either way, your new hair looks so good and happy to watch another vlog of yours!🤗
Woo hoo. Couldn’t be happier to see this notification can’t wait to watch !
I agree about Spring. The light in Spring is lovely, there are pretty blossoms on the trees and so many flowers; bluebells, daffodils, tulips. I think it’s the prettiest time 😊 P.S. my brother and his wife had 2 boys then 6 years later a little girl came along. You never know…
Im usually a silent watchter but I have to say: Im 30 years old and also had  fixed braces for the last year because of some teeth correction thing. I was aways self conscious about them but seeing you talking so casually about them makes me happy and gives me hope that things like this are not such a "weird" thing for adults anymore 🫶🎉
Big yes to birth stories!
I can't stop looking at your HAIR!  It looks so amazing 😍
Welcome back Zoe congrats on 5 million subscribers keep up the good work love your video's as always especally your sunday vlog's you and Alfie in the same hour you made my sunday love and hugs to you Alfie and the girls hope you all enjoy your sunday xxxx
You’re GLOWING Zoe. So freakin’ pretty!! Missed you🥰🥰
Omgg vlogs are back ❤
I have never clicked on a notification so fast 🥰🥰
i'm so excited you're back 🥹❤️ love you so much 🤗💕✨
i'm so excited you're back 🥹❤️ love you so much 🤗💕✨
How annoying like for years people have asked when are you having baby and now it’s when are you having another it never ends
i think this is been the best glow up i’ve ever seen of zoe! i love this season you are in as growing and being a mum! ❤
I love how cosy and wholesome and relaxing this vlog is xx
So lovely to have you back, Zoe!! Fingers crossed for Vlogust 🤞🏻
Oh I’m so glad you are back! ..love the hair..Novie is growing up so fast..lovely to see you all again..much love ❤❤❤❤
I love these type of vlogs Zoe! 12 years in, still relatable, even more coz we have the same adult life stuff. I loved the chat about finding yourself again after kids, and how its still going, also the importanace of BOOK things you love, because that would make the commitment easier.
The way you described the girls is EXACTLY me and my sister’s personnalities, it’s crazy 😮 I’m the Novie (2nd born), she’s always been more reserved but loving and caring with everyone especially in our family, very in tune with other people’s emotions. And I’m the going out into the world sometimes a little too confidently 😂 pretty sassy and assertive little sister. One thing I would say is that growing up people constantly compared us and that put a strain on our relationship. We’re 5 years apart so when she turned 17/18 she is the one who really made the step to prioritize and « fix » our relationship, she made the efforts to spend a lot of time with me and actually try to understand me. Safe to say she is my world, my rock and i would do anything and everything for her. We’re 24 and 29 now and our relationship is still just as close. She brings me what I lack of and I do the same for her, i thank God (and my parents haha) for giving us each other ! Sibling relationship is in my opinion the closest relationship you can have, especially sisters. 🩷
The gender question is so funny! I have two girls as well, a 4 year old and almost 11 month old, and when I was pregnant with my second people would assume I wanted a boy but actually I wanted another girl. I would’ve been so happy either way, genuinely, but I love having girls and feel so complete 🥰♥️ just feel lucky to be a mummy x
First Zoe video of the year and it comes out on my birthday 🙂
Novie’s rolled up valentines pjs 🥺 omg! We’ve missed you guys!
Zoe you've brightened my day with this blog! Also, can I say you look stunning!
Yes would love the pros and cons of  c section to  natural birth . Considering having children in the new few years ❤
YAAY!! I needed this today ❤
Alfie telling Zoe to say pineapple so that she won’t sneeze reminded me of when he said that to her in the first YouTube video they made together! I got emotional🥹
What a beautiful start to a video with the valentines breakfast. Who does Novie get her dimples from? 😊
i’m so happy 🥹
I have 2 boys, and I can’t picture myself with girls! You’re meant to be a girl mum!
Yes you and joe would be great.
Hiya Zoe! Hope you’ve had a lovely break, so excited to watch the new vlog! Just wanted to say that your channel has meant so much to me, especially starting a new college this year and bonding with new friends over it. Thank you so much for making my days brighter every time you post!! 🌼 💓
Have missed the vlogs soooo much!!!
A Zoe vlog is just what I need today!❤
❤❤❤ for me it's the other way around. Christmas is hard because of different reasons, January is good because it's a fresh start and February is hard because because winter feels too long and I haven't fulfilled all my great plans from January yet 😅
Zoe and Alfie Vlogs on Sunday are the best Motivation and Gift! Thank you guys! So cozy yet motivating ❤
You would suit a bob so much!
Oh we're being FED!!!❤❤
yesss please tell us more about your birth stories!!
zoe and joe podcast is such a good idea hahaha 16:03
Those Valentines day breakfast moments were the sweetest ! <3
You kinda look like millie Bobby Brown ❤
the whole video i was looking at your hair thinking how amazon it looks and how much this haircut suits you!!😍
When I tell you i screamed when I saw that you uploaded I’m so happy that you are posting again. I just watched Alfie’s video and now yours I very so blessed. I can’t believe how big the girls are getting it’s so wonderful to see them grow and such a privilege to be able to see it and your amazing family thank you. I can’t wait to see all the amazing videos you are going to make this year. Love from New Zealand
The hair is making you look even more like your mum!! Loving it. Also wanted to say how easing it is seeing you grow in your 30s as even though I’m 9 years off lol it’s always seemed so scary being ‘old’ but you show it isn’t❤️thankyou for always being a positive presence online
such a beautiful family ❤
i have never been so excited to see this notification popping up on a sunday morning😍
Thank god my favs are back, missed you guys soooo much
yay! new vlog ❤ - i 100% get you about the struggle of coming down for christmas. i feel the exact same. january & tbh february are difficult months for me, just the feeling of a new year & the pressure of that. & feeling like there isn’t anything to look forward too & i just always feel a bit down & tbh a bit shite this time of year. but i know brighter days are coming & im not alone xx
I keep seeing Meredith grey with the new hair! Its gorgeous
It warms my heart to see you as a mother Zoe. I have been watching you since 2011 when you were in your childhood home. I now have 3 little girls. Two of which are around the same ages as your girlies. I feel like I’ve watched a bestie grow with me. Thanks for sharing ❤ sending love from Sydney xx
Yes please do the birth stories!! They are so interesting to hear ❤
It’s my 26th birthday today and I couldn’t ask for a better way to start my day✨
So good to have you back posting vlogs🥰 Love hearing these topics in your videos, I'm a mum to two kids (my eldest will be turning 8 in April) and I still feel like i've lost myself/don't fully recognise who I am anymore, it's a tough process being a parent but so worth it at the same time. Hope this year brings health, happiness and luck your way (and more vlogs for us to enjoy ofcourse) xx
crazy how much babies change in a couple of months, from vlogmas to now novie has grown so much!!!
A new vlog from Fleur De Force, Alfie and Zoe in the same morning, oh YouTube you are spoiling me!
It‘s so beautiful how you describe both of your little girl’s personalities. It will be so interesting to watch this back in like 15-20 years :) they are both so special!    Also it’s so interesting how you describe your recovery from birth. It was the complete opposite for me: had a planned c-section with my first due to breach position and the recovery was brutal!! Couldn’t walk for at least a week. My second birth was a natural unmedicated birth and after birth I would just get up and was back to normal within hours. Everyone’s experience is so so different.
Inquisitive!
Last Year when you did come back after youre pause having Novie, Ottie was more talking like never before. Now you come back and Novie is walking 😂 Girl, you can't leave. Everytime something big happened in January or February 😂
I can totally see a boy and ottie and novi dressing him up. Be so cute
Yes so exiting just watched alfies upload now yours zoe,lovely treat for a sunday morning
oh my god I used to have a groovy chick bike I completely forgot until I seen those magazines 😂
Welcome back 🥰💛💛💛💛
Welcome back ❤ I love spending my evenings watching your videos and seeing your family develop and thrive. I strive to be a mother like you. I’m very much looking forward to seeing what comes of this year. Xxxxx
Don't worry, the awkward questions still happen when you have one of each. I always get 'oh you'll not want anymore then since you have one of each" 😅 my daughter is 12 and my son is 8 and I'm still not 100% sure that I'm done having kids haha. x
Oh we’re SO back
Zoe, you look more like your mum than ever with that hairstyle ❤
I'm really loving this type of edit AHHHHHHHHH so happy the vlogs are back <33333
ZOE! i’m sorry but i’ve got to say again that your hair cut is perfect for you, makes you just glow & that makes me so happy after watching you all these years! lovely vlog!! see u in the next vid xxx
The matching pyjamas are ADORABLE 😭 where are they from?🩷
Great vlog . Your hair looks amazing. ❤
Ah pleaseee do a story time for your births!! As a midwife I always love hearing people’s experiences!
Yayyyy they are back <3 im so excited to watch this
Officially the best day of 2025🥺🤗
NEVER BEEN HAPPIER FOR A VLOG
I RACED HERE
Inquisitive is the word you might have been looking for Zoë
The whole boy/girl thing with babies... Mum of 3 girls here 🙋🏼‍♀️ I once had a complete stranger talk to me while we were out once and said 'ahhh they're such lovely girls. I bet you wish you had a boy though?' I turned round and asked 'which one are you suggesting I should trade for a boy? I am not having a 4th child for the sake of having a boy, I wanted three children, I had 3, they happen to all be amazing little girls. Why would I change that?' It baffles me. I think it must be ingrained in us from olden days, you have to produce an heir...
yes yes please do a video on both your births, currently 28 weeks and want any information I can get
Happy to see you back here 😍🌷💘💘💘
"I am usually a silent viewer, I've been following you since 2014. I'm going through a pretty tough time in my life, and I wanted to tell both you and Alfie how much your vlogs bring me joy. Waking up on Sundays and knowing that the day will start better because I have you to watch, a positive example of family, gives me the desire to be better and to live life with positivity even in difficult moments. Ps. I'm from Rome, and for my 18th birthday, I was gifted a trip to Brighton with my mom. I hope to return soon as a 27-year-old ❤️"
The question you addressed about how to find yourself when you don't know yourself - i find going back to basics, use this page in the book of your life to rewrite or slightly edit. Find a different interest whether that will be solo or with friends or family.
• Ottie: typical eldest daughter, people pleaser, creative, considerate & anxious  • Novie: typical youngest sibling energy, wild, chaotic & confident 😅
Just commenting whilst listening to you answer the finding yourself question. My little one is 5 and a half and I’m just seeing me peeking through again. I can only imagine if you have a second within the first ones five years then you’d start again from the beginning? I’ve just had a styling session with a local stylist and it has been great! Different body to before baby and honing my style has been great for me mentally! ❤
Yaaaaaay she’s back! So excited to watch this with a brew this morning!!
Audibly squealed when I saw first vlog 2025!!!!! So excited
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
I can’t stop looking at Zoe’s hair. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. Like hello Rachel is that you??
WELCOME BACK 🫶🏼🫶🏼 MISSED U SO so much
Can l ask where your cardigan is from xx
Yayyy a new video!!! Made my day already 🤗🥰
I have 3 girls currently 15weeks pregnant and the amount of people that have asked if we’re hoping for a boy is unbelievable I’d be happy with either and happy and healthy is all we want but I literally can’t picture myself with a boy, so happy to have a Zoe vlog this morning while putting all our washing away
Sounds like novi is Alfie
Waiting for a Zoe vlog since the dawn of 2025😢❤
With the new hair you really remind me of rachel from friends ❤
Watch me spend my entire morning watching BOTH Zoe and Alfie’s new vlogs!!!!!!
Yay ❤
Oh my morning has just gotten a million times better now!🥺 First vlog of the year, and all so wholesome!❤️
I had a birthday in January. My 32rd. 😂 My favourite Season is spring. I like to watch the flowers bloom 🌼, the birds get back 🐦, its not warm or cold 🌄
Ughggh just so beautiful! Family, soul and vibes
THE QUEEN IS BACKKKK!!!!! 👏🏼
I totally get the Christmas come down. I've put twinkly lights on my fireplace and it's helped so much!
I’m in exactly the same position brace wise - had them as a teenager, got them again now on the top arch to correct an insanely stubborn crossbite. Nearly there now, it’ll be worth it in the end X
First vlog of the year and so excited for them to be back, we have missed you! 🧡
switching your favourite season from Autumn is a complete plot twist  ps love the vlog happy you're back! ❤
I have now started doing a ceramic painting class every month 😊
Yessssss you’re back 🥰🥰🥰
Nothing beats these vlogs!!!
kids are so so cute ❤❤❤
suddenly life is worth living
I never know what to comment because if I replied to everything I want, I'd be able to make an entire vlog myself 😂 but very happy to see you back here 🩷
Happy 2025 💌 you are glowing as always .  I hope you enjoyed your time off it is always important for a well needed refresh. Sending love from Perth Australia 🇦🇺

SHE’S BACK 💖💖💖
(I don’t normally comment, usually a silent watcher but I had to say this!)  Zoe, you’re the best mummy. If I turn out to be even half of the mother that you are to your children then I’ll be so happy. They’re extremely lucky to have you. As someone who didn’t experience this kind of motherly love as a child, it makes me so happy to see that it does happen elsewhere.  Sooo happy you’re back vlogging, we’ve missed you all. ❤
I’ve missed these so much since vlogmas!!!
Lovee you guyss you’ve been giving amazing vibes for years ❤
