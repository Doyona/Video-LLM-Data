Can’t erase mohbad in ur life
Good niara Marley
OU ES MOOHBAD ... WO IS MOHBAD
Killer where is mohbad 😢😢?
❤❤❤
Justice for mohbad but naira Marley has no problem I Know there are some consequences but God forgive us who don't know the truth...🤣I love u naira Marley much love to you from Uganda 🇺🇬
Ghanaians fans gather here let’s show  some love here ❤
❤😭❤️🔥✌️👌👏
In this life, don't allow them make them kill you. E get why, because life will goes on(Eniku ni tie gbee)
Vibes❤
Justice for mohbad 😔
Rubbish music. Zero substance, even the beat, rhythm and lyrics have depreciated exponentially in appeal.  The moment the scales fell from our eyes after Mobahd's demise, Naira's music really lost its appeal and spunk. What a sad decline. Rip Imole
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 on point ❤️ glad you're back.
Ko ni da fun naira Marley You will only know sorrow Life will never be comfortable for you  Ad the people listening to your music  Una pikin go suffer wetin imole suffer for naira Marley hand  As una de press that like button na so life go de hard una too
Hope boy 🎉
Nigerian age so fool that they want you to be in jail just because you had issue with the late Imole. It's that a justice ??? Do you guys think Imole will be happy just because person wey don't know anything about his death are in jail ??? If you guys put the same energy to develop Nigeria as you you put to jail Naira, Nigeria go better as we want. One love Naira ❤
Rest in peace Mobad
I love 😊music ❤❤❤❤
This is trash music, most of people listening to this guy music lacks moral standard
Rest in peace Mohbad
YOU THINK SAY WE GO FORGET ABOUT WHAT YOU DID TO MOBHAD ABI!!!!!!
YOU GET MIND RELEASE MUSIC ABI!!!!!
YOUR FATHER!!!!
YOUR FATHER!!!!
YOUR FATHER!!!!
