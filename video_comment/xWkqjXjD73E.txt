I sure hope you show me sympathy not because you have too.  But these yoyos  and certain people get in my business and it throws me off some.  But their going to pay in the name of Jesus Christ. So I show you sympathy
Te amo
I only want you
I'm not on the fence silly
Hope you have a great day yea ❤
Hey beautiful ❤️❤️
If you need to rest . Rest foreal . May Jesus Christ help u and give you strength in all you have done , and are doing for me.  I do pray that it will all work out for us but others as well. Love you beautiful jojo❤
Oooooooh! The expressions! 🤩😍🤤

Miley can do no wrong, so happy she continues to bless us with these anthems.
Gorgeous
Don´t need a doctor i got a way to good of type of immune system to need to bother to rely upon that. Whereas if you were to see how i live and eat you´d think hiw the hell is that even possible, same way all other things in my life are. Magic 😋
genuinely one of the worst songs ever made
feel free Miley
No gracias, solo soy Doctore, para eso están los y las enfermeras jaja
Miley ❤
Why has she had such AMAZING hair since Hannah Montana
Good night beautiful 🤩
Otherwise I'll be like Elvis and die on the sh.. jack . And I gave u permission to over see any and all business and any identity theft in all ways .
I'm trying to let u work out with the blessings of my brothers in prison and the first lady.
Morning miss little momma as long as it's really u the real Miley Cyrus
Have a great night baby I mean doctor little moma
She looks so used. Dislike
Fantástica irrepetible 🎉🎉🎉

Maybelline making more noise than SB is kinda chocking
If you see it ... Don't shoot me down. ;;;/.
I heard this song playing while shopping in a Decjuba clothing store in Australia, and it suits the store
Ей так идут все эти платья 👗 😃👍✨❤️‍🔥
1:00 Тебя много не бывает 🥰
?!Unique!?
She's gone Tina Turner.
This is a masterpiece.
You ARE like a movie STAR… Back to??
A new work out video!! Love it!!
a song that can be listened to over and over again and still not be able to stop
This is just one of those perfect songs/perfect videos. The performance is beast mode. She’s so good at everything. Brilliant collab 😆🥰
I’m going to reboot in living color and have Miley as my lead dancer..

Como pode a Miley ser tão bonita 😍, e mais uma vez fez incrível vc é um cantadores sensacional 👏👏👏
Doutor Gatti.
September 2025?
Miley Cyrus accomplished something incredible. From kid's girl's star to real woman and artist. I'm not her fan but I appreciate her.
I hear in this Måneskin - I wanna be your slave.
Nie
Miley is serving Can't Be Tamed era looks here.
Entregou demais ❤❤❤❤🖤🖤🖤
Why i feel like she will end up like britney spears
Yeah
Kimmy Granger,,,,,,Miley Cyrus said I ain't that much of a bitch,,,to split you and Kimmy apart
So. I shared the same Bed In Iraq with Paris Hilton and Uma Jolie,,,,I would tell them to leave,,go find something to do  I would get on Skype with Miley Cyrus and Design Automobiles
Yeaaaaj
Kinda tainted for me since I learned she first recorded this as a teen ( please don't take my word for it research for yourself)
Súperrr me encanta
شبه الشيطان
Questa canzone viene utilizzata nella sigla di Sarabanda su Italia 1
يا مايلي سيريس غيري تسريحة شعرك وغيري آلميك اب  .
Miley's sexiest form.
Amazing song and clip! Thanks!😁
🧚🧠
miley just turned my bad day into a dance party
the ultimate fun track
dr. Cyrus - the healer of bad vibes
my prescription? this song on repeat
where is Pharrell?
what a fun song to jam to
Miley actually has a great voice and magnetic presence but I wish she would pick better songs than these calculated overproduced Pop slop. She better than this and I wish she had more faith in herself to go deeper and not so obvious.
the only cure i need is more miley music
no need to diagnose, this track is already infectious
minimal set, maximum star power
serving 1980s glam with a modern twist
Miley is in full disco mode
sequins, big hair and pure glam
that catsuit is giving space chic
midnight medication? yes please.
Miley is the only doctor i need tbh
prescribing this on repeat - Miley is the only doctor i need
who needs a cure when im already hooked?
How he this old , but still look so good? 😘✌️
I want you to leave this time
Miley had her coffee early outside one morning,,,she comes running into the house out of breath,,,be theatrical like the video,,,,I said what the heck is wrong with you Miley,,,she says there's an animal outside that I have never seen before,,,so I went outside,,,I said its just a ground hog Miley,,,you never seen one of those before,,,,,she guessed not,,,,I explained his house used to sit somewhere under our new septic system
That outfit and hair is Tina Turner vibing hard core
No
OMG LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS AND SONGS FROM SOUTH LA 💟🎶💋😎🎇🎇

it's uncanny, how much she looks like a young Jane Fonda!!  Just Gorgeous
Bien.
She was giving us a sneak peak of “ Something Beautiful “ Before she. Even knew it and I live for it . Future predictions in a nutshell #TeamMiley

I have only one word - dedication! Thank you for everything, Miley. ❤

This song is so underrated
I slept on this when it first came out… but it’s been stuck in my head
Anyone 2025?

She hasn't  won 2 Grammy  she has  won her first  Grammy
Such an underrated song ❤
Don't mind me, just obsessing over Miley's fabulous "juege"

Love Miley ❤juz so cute and adorable😂
Wtf

Absolutely brilliant music at the minute from miley

Miley has an amazing body!

I swear she needs a album called "Stages Of Miley" with all her hits throughout the year's to show where she started and how she's ended up
Este vídeo me gusta mucho.

Pharrell ripping off Maneskin 'I Wanna Be Your Slave' like he did with Blurred Lines and Marvin Gaye. hmmm
真覺得為什麼要三個人來唱，每個人都只有一小段。。一點都不過癮；雖然我是很愛三個人後段全身白裝走路的氣場，但是，這首歌算短，三個人的表演機會太少了～而且其實lisa除了開頭有唱完整段，後面簡直像在配音，到底唱片公司是要害她嗎？
My ❤ montana tumi amar moner antana ♥️💯🏋️❤️🌹⭐⭐⭐
Sounds like Maneskin 's song  I can be your slave
This is like Hotline Bling for you.
Hola
Super brava e super sexy ma con gran classe ❤
my mom forced me to work it out and become nurse
I'm going to the woods and cutting my own logs and building a house. Hufflepuff
Her body is insane.
Me ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wooooohhhhh ... OMG, I LOVE THIS.  Really catchy and seductive - without the sticking out of her tongue or twerking with Robin Thicke. 🤣 It's like she has suddenly matured into an extraordinary artist and performer.  Go, go, GO Mylie - time for you to take your place in the multiple grammy league table.
Terrific song, looking forward to whats next.
Ilove doctor forever ❤❤❤🎶🎶

I don’t know why this song sounds so familiar it sounds like those songs played in the mall
Shes great but the hair is just not doing it for me lol
Pasando la Doctor completita
This os just a little too good
Anyone in 1972?
I'm thankful that Miley shares her gifts with the world. Beautiful, talented, courageous and confident. Great role model!
LOVE this look!  Giving 90's supermodel hair vibes!  Think Cindy Crawford, Claudia!
I'm getting Tina Turner 🤌

Trafficking Patrick Turner & Heather Long cries Michelle Trachtenberg / Harriet the spy, Miley Cyrus / Hannah Montana, Mila Kunis / Meg Griffin & Milla Jovovich
Looks like you had a lot of fun making this. When we can we expect more?
Ugghhh that foot stomp....
Maneskin - I wanna be your slave. The same rhythm. There are even similar words.
She would be the absolute perfect looking woman if she didn't have all those cringe tats all over her. If she wants to go for the classy lady image then she should consider having them removed.
Anyone else doing the dance?
She has the longevity and should be put at the same level of fame in the music industry as Taylor is in today’s time. She’s more deserving
Video is like an extended perfume ad
Listening in February 2025! Anyone else? ❤❤❤

This song just sounds like MANESKIN - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE. And the beginning of the song, first lyrics, the rhythm… Miley is gorgeous but sorry, the producer or the writer copied too much from Eurovision’s winner song.

OMG the adult look with the dark hair and the vintage outfits makes her look just 100%!!!! Yes!!!
Miley is the friend we all need 🎉
I need to see Alexis Rose do a cover of this song with all those Alexis-coded moves
❤
Mopey is sad. She now looks the same as every other done up tart. The lyrics are gross and suggestive garbage. She is pigeon toed. Getting older. Hair extensions clipped in back of the hair. Just looks gross.
What is animal you are creating?  - Is it noisy baboon? 😏
Her music always makes me feel so intense and liberated

i miss 80s synthirock miley, she was the best.
❤❤❤❤ i like it
This girl is looking more and more like Dolly everyday! Do you sis! Genuinely hope she's happy. She seems so nice and genuine.
LOVE IT😍
I get Tina Turner vibes off of this. I absolutely love Miley. She can't be beat
This woman is definitely an example that after falling, you can rise stronger and more beautiful. She looks absolutely stunning and shines so brightly!
❤❤❤❤❤
I live you🎉🎉🎉
Queeen❤

Oh Miley, I’m so sad for your voice, since fire don’t know what happened to make you look suddenly 50.
DAS HERMOSA CON ESE BODY Y UNS SONRISA ES SUPER SEXY SUENA SUPER BUENO SUS CANCIONES ❤👏🏻♥️😉🍷💙💗💙💗💃🏻
NOW...I KNOW MILEY  SHE IS PURE TALENT
Me ha emocionado desde el primer segundo  Estaba viendo el programa y haciéndo otras cosas  (era música de fondo) y ha sido empezar a oir esta cancion y quedar totalmente hipnotizada. Qué bonita. Enhorabuena
Qe voz qe tiene, wow como canta, como me gusta sus canciones ♥️🥰
Sebagai seorang penyanyi, Miley nih keren bngt kek semua genre di coba. Jadi dia selalu nyoba keluar dari comfort zone nya.
i like this song
She's  conceited
🎀
Elle est magnifique 😍  Audacieuse, énergique, envoûtante, electrique..., et ces faceties au lieu de l' enlaidir, l' embellissent encore! BRAVO 👍  Avec mes félicitations  Admiration et Gratitude ❤
This look reminds me of Tina Turner.
Did you come from the Billy Ray guy? I loved achy breaky heart. Kept my mullet till I was 5 because of him. You're gorgeous. You make fantastic music. Mother's daughter is fire.
I love this song, very funky 😊
Hot Damn💚❤️🩵💜💙💛🩷
Damn, fireeee Hot ❤❤❤❤❤❤
How can you don't love her? 🙂
Is this the same person who sings wrecking ball??  The world is changing fast …
1:54 sound loveeeee
Grubo,pozdrawiam
Who is still listening to this in 2025
😮
She is so lovely 😍
ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED!!! 🙌🏻 Can't deny Pharrell Williams been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
So back mother!!!
g u y ✨
Miley , Jesus is knocking He wants to walk with YOU a Mile Y? Because he desires to get get to know the REAL U.

Miley lived so many lives
Hello Trixie Mattel! 💖
This song and video is literally the shit! The ending is amazing. Trying to think of the movie that came from. Bloody Mary?
De las voces más auténticas que he escuchado ❤❤❤
I hate the song it's disgusting and it's inappropriate unpause maybe you shouldn't have a dress that doesn't show your underwear
跟着她一起跳操很棒
Kiri Kiri ❤Miley ❤🌘🌕🌒 God ☀️ Sun ❤
سمعتها في الملحق الطبي في السفاره 😂🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺
You make me a bit uncomfortable u know, but in a good way I guess. Cheers. 🎉😂  Mvh Kjell Rune Hauk Bonsaksen
Getting major sheryl crow vibes. I love this Era she's in
She looks so fake. This image doesn't fit her
Whoa! Those legs and the whole vibe... I'm about to give my age away  Giving Tina Turner. I'm not her target audience but I'm here for it! Lovin' It
F my PhD doctors she really didn’t know just saw me as a threat. I know to many hot style ppl to make sense to her. What do doctors know for real
Miley cyrus, con su música. Grande el exito que continúa, por  todo  lo  alto.  😊😊😊😊😊   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tener ganas de curarse es relativo ..... pero podria ser una enfermedad irreversible
OMG!!!!! LA AMEEEEE 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
She could play a young Jane Fonda
My husband and I have watched the original video probably hundred of times. Sometimes we watch it before we go to bed just to chill out.
Are there any other videos like this that breaks it down?
cool video
I always feel like she's got someone else's head on her body. So much work done she's somebody else now.
At firt I thought I was listening the female version of I wanna be yous slave by Maneskin
This actually sucks I'm my opinion
Miley deserves a halftime show for the Super Bowl ❤
❤❤❤
0:40 and 0:47 why stupid camera holder s£xualizing miley by zooming her special area?? Almost all female music videos r like p○rn ....  ppl focus on sexualizing female rather than showung THEIR talent
Song is the kind of vibes we need!
😲😍😘Beautiful woman..perfect body..beautiful eyes and face.💖👌👏
This reminds me of Tracy dancing in GTA 5 💀
He he she is wonderful. Kisses.
Myley Cyrus / unique
Miley you are honestly so beautiful. ❤
This just sounds like a poor copy of a Pharrell tune. Frustrating as she’s much better than this song allows her. She’s Miley. This song won’t let her be Miley.
This is so good and this was a scrapped bangers song, can’t wait to see more from her. You’re amazing Miley!

I never comment. I have to say I loved Miley from day one. But girl you aaaaaare such a stunner. what a beautiful woman.
This song, mv, everything about it, is so weird.  It's weird because it's completely outdated, but it's not fun, it's not clever, or inventive, it's just completely soulless and devoid of what would elevate from just being a nonsensical album filler. It's not even B-side.
It’s not a Pharrell song if it doesn’t have that four count in the beginning.
I’m Deep in Love, and my music feels like moonlight on a lonely night.
Her father is great, however  I  prefer Mileys  music, the sound of Miley Cyruss, is my preference, thank you,
I feel bad for her because she used to have a soft voice and now she has a beautiful ruspy voice
0: 50 I think Miley Cyrus is just great. Her lips and eyes move like a leopard in a cage, preparing in his nature and behaviour like an animal for his next predator feeding. Her voice is fantastically beautiful. She wants to express that she can stand out from society by finding a style that is reflected in its diversity. If I met Miley, I would take her in my arms and say that she dances a butterfly beautifully on her planet and in addition we would like to say that she is please old butterfly there than the rest of the inconspicuous and cruel world.
She really thought this was gonna hit😂
Desde que se dejó de su ex esposo, como que revivió, esa mujer se ve espectacular
i just wanted to get married. im not robbing a bank.
Miley Cyrus! It's missing two bangerz Nightmare & Last Goodbye. This one's too good too 🔥
amazing,Miley
This sucks
She looks so like her mum in this video.
Miley has worked so hard to overcome her younger days craziness. Just like Paris Hilton. It’s paying off! Great job.
Si te sigues visriendo asi te pueden matar. ♻️ happy sonrisa.
Love Miley.❤️
I wish I could get a gf who was only 1% as cool as miley and it would still be the best gf I ever had
Who is Pharell ?
Cool
Love Miley.❤️
Jane Fonda vibes haha
❤❤🎉
This was my favourite song in 2024 no cap
Alguien habla español?..
Linda cancion, cantas divina exitos y bendiciones Miley
😅
Who asked for this song... sorry not for me.
She stole this flow from Maneskin I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE !!!
изпуши ли багажа!?😢
She is so so cool..jeano  luv you Miley 😊

She's seen pretending to be a mix of Jane Fonda with Tina Turner ... 😑
This dress looks like it’s her solo dancing with the stars no cap. Meaning she’s a woman that can dance alone.
Love Miley.❤️
One of a kind!!

The German shrink offered by excellence, for you.
I just love her and always have after Disney
I love how Miley being her old self 🥺
Hi 👋 Yesterday I dreamed that my wife Miley Cyrus called me and we agreed to meet in Los Angeles. When I woke up I almost cried. What a shame it was a fucking dream. Haha.
CATCHY VIBING SONG MILEY!!! 🎉❤

Talented. Brilliant. Incredible. Amazing. Show stopping. Spectacular. Never the same!
😁
😂great fun with this song! Huh?
fecha a boca miley
Those can’t be her real teeth 😮 😅I’m jealous 😢
😀 Corinthians 6:9a11,19a 21 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some; but those who belong to Jesus are washed, are sanctified, are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. 19 But what do I say? That an idol is anything? Or that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything? 20 Rather, I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice to themselves they sacrifice to demons and not to God. And I do not want you to be participants with demons. 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of demons.
Aquí seguimos los que la apoyamos desde Hannah Montana, ¡Y vamos por más!

What a great song 🎉🎉
How she looks so good
I'm afraid this isn't even a b side. Pharrell must have known this was sh*t.did he not like her or something
I love it! I feel I wanna dance with
❤❤❤❤❤
Tina Turner's vibe 🙌
Seriously, Miley in all her spectrum (talent, personality, body shape...) is goals.
She can most definitely cure me
usa made  usa i love you
I loved the Pharell Williams part
❤❤😅😅
hanna montana
The veeners scare me. But she looks great other then that
Amei 💖 mais ainda queria que fosse Nightmare 😢

Woww she looks incredible!!! Giving me Tina Turner vibes!!
WORK IT MILEYYYYY
From the streets of Shreveport. Happy 2024 birthday Miss Cyrus. God bless Gurl  💙 💙 💙 🙏🙏🙏
The Jane Fonda x Barbarella DNA is strong and on point!
Happy birthday 🎀   I got your doc order... I got this script  down.....
Miley undeniably keeps outdoing herself, but this song is the exception --pure fluff. Quit hanging with Pharrell, Miley.
One of my favorite Miley hits 🔥🔥🔥
I got touch i got Phil
Hallo ich komme aus Deuschlant ich liebe dich kannst du ein Konzert machen 😂😢❤
You don’t need Pharrell
Did she do her makeup like Jane Fonda to go with the "work out" theme of the song?? Because once you see it, good luck trying not to see it ALL THE DAMN TIME NOW.
he really heals. With voice and body. Excellent doctor 😊
Those moves! That hair! She's channeling her inner "Tina" here
I am a happily married 72 year old man - and I think that Miley Cyrus is amazing.  Beautiful, talented, gutsy, so so dynamic.  What a performer!  Hat's off to her!
ふわふわに包まれてるマイリー
miley is incredible
Wow... Aphrodite would be jealous of this woman LOL
Does anyone else get Shania vibes from this?

miiey  cyrus 👋🧡
I will not go to us
I like Miley and I've watched her grow up but this?  She's turned to trashy.  While the song is catchy I think she could have done so much more with this video instead of the standard full body dancing.  It looks like all the other ones out there that we watch.  Could have done some doc video of her being a nurse or something.
Randomly giving me Jane Fonda vibes. 🔥😅❤️

I’m glad that as a straight (well, bi, pan) woman, she is not afraid to present femininity in a “strong” and assertive form.

Darling, you can sing but dancing isn't your thing...
¡DIVA DIVINA!
Me encanta, me encanta, me encanta. Esta chica fue, es y será genial e irrepetible. Yo la adoro por ser tan ella y no como alguien más.
Pharrell Williams is a ghost he didn't appear in the video
.
She went from Bangerz to Denturez lmao
🎉🎉increíble ,,, grammy  bien merecido ,,,
I so want to see you do a "caveman" type movie like the old one with ringo. with that wild hair
Hot
It's a rubbish song haha. Sorry, I hate it Miley!
Heavenly voice. I wish the theatrics was not trying to overpower her. That part is rubbish. She can just be herself, sing and people would buy records and adore her. Why the fuc* all the theatre
Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus - Doctor
Why can't I get my second chance..?(layed out on cardboard..haha.. the homeless everywhere are not laughing)... I was the last to know ..once again... GET TO THE PUNCHLINE!!.. PUNK JOKES ARE MEAN.. you want to work it out and I want to work it in... My water will keep putting out your flames it'll just be a steamy mess of fog... Misty for sure... How could you be my destiny?
💛💚💙❤️♥️❤️😜😜
Her true identity is.....  Would like to really know??? Her name is Juno Acient Roman Queen of the Gods!

So good I love Miley cyrus forme her hanna montanna years and she's grown so much she's is a icon love her
sono cieca dopo gli arresti  si permette ancora di mettere le mani davanti che non lo vuole

She brings new meaning to several words I can think of...

Rubbish choreography
She has a man voice, right turn off
Amigos y amigas yo tengo un criterio yo la amo pero aparte de eso este disco es contagioso hasta las personas que no saben inglés le gusta.
For a minute I thought she was stupid Beyonce.

Paul Harrell wasn't Williams.  Paul the tower climber that fell years ago. Pleasant Williams whom was trying to steal my identity. A group of black people trying to build a reason for terrorizing me after trying to steal my identity and give it to Pleasant Williams III  I was never Paul, the people you're listening to are liars. This song is proof of their fraud.  You were getting much of your art work from my myspace page and making your songs from it. Its why your father was driving a maserati. Its why wrecking Ball. It's why you were dreaming of tigers. (Calvin and Hobbs)
It's to free to be in ❤
Este tema es excelente no me cansa escucharlo y ese baile de ella te amo miley
Dear my friends.  사간은 꿈이고 공간은 너의 새끼들의  목숨이다. 한바탕 놀더라도 정신은 있어야지.
❤️🔥🔥🔥❤
A real free woman ❤❤❤❤
😮😊😅🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Warum hat pharell Williams keinen Part? Ich habe gedacht er hat einen xD LOL lachflash
😮 essa ainda não tinha ouvido.
What a fun song. I hope you have a good life Miley Cyrus. 🙂💖
She so good she got a Grammy
She got the look and hair what a nice homage to Tina Turner
It’s missing something. The lyrics need to be more diverse and the imagery of nurse/doctor is tired and boring.
OMG!  What beautiful earrings!
잘 보고 갑니다. 수고 하세요.

Miley cyrus is definitely the Greatest singer this world will ever know, the girl is absolutely sensational, her voice, style and everything about is totally unique and genuine, there's nobody that even come close to mileys amazing talent, she is a one off gift to the world, she's an outstanding person absolutely fantastic,  I love her so much . Keep you a Rocking Miley ❤
She looks absolutely incredible! Her eyes are glowing, she's in perfect shape! I love her natural beauty and those blue eyes, and the fact that she doesn't seem to have had any plastic surgery, just allowed her body to be what the goddess gave her!  I love this Miley🎉
Definitely heard some homage to “Blurred Lines” 😆

I know it’s random but I recently got a Disney channel. I’d wish Miley have her new tv shows that would be nice. Like Miley gonna rescue stray dogs because Miley loves dogs that would be nice to watch.
What a fun video/song 😭🫶 shes so beautiful
Miley 👠
love this tune !❤
The lady who used to live there and said she used to live right across the street and she also said that they destroyed her house buried everything and build payment over parking lot and then she moved right across the street to the corner House that up for sale plus Janet Ramirez doesn't trust me or something or it be a Bible scripture
Bulletproof because my peoples mom lives next door and they know how they want me to get killed by my people
like the Bible says I go to you
She look like a Crackhead shit is wild
❤❤❤
I love you sweetheart 💗
DIIIVIIINEEE!!!🎉😂❤🎉😂❤💪♀️👑✌️💋🧠🎶🎙🎶💄💍💎🔊💋💋
GOOooD❣️👍✨
No
Does she not have any real friends willing to tell her that she’s dancing and looking absolutely ridiculous??? This is sooooo bad in every sense of the word. Song, dance, style, and i hope the person who did that to her hair is fired, because they forgot to do anything to the black side. Daaaamn, this is really bad. She should really stop trying to be someone she’s not. She went through her stage of trying to copy Blondies look and voice, and now she’s trying to copy the 70’s disco era? It’s not working either.
@mileycyrus when are u passing by to take a look at the painting btw? Ps i kinda love liking u and like lov8ng u even more. It aint my fault though, c'est parceque je t'adore
@mileycyrus what's going on, go9d morning to u to. Still didnt see a @cleurenkarel and then im hiding. I need my spiritual view just to try and find u and i still cant convince u to get to my place still live at houtmarkt 2 in sint-truoden btw 😊

Anyone else hearing "I wanna be your slave" by Maneskin?
Overrated and rubbish
This woman found Bob Mackie.
What a queen!
After her breakup I feel like Parton was really there for her
Definitely see the Dolly Parton influence and I love to see it
I love that it looks like she's just having a good time dancing around like no one is watching.

Hello Miley
IDU how all these ppl complimenting on her look while they're their fan means they probably have seen her younger self on Disney channel. Now, she looks like Scarlet Johanson has been on meth for 5 years. It's a wake up call ppl, know the difference btwn supporting and sucking ass

If you are a FEMALE singer it's all about "Look how sexy I am!", isn't it? - I can feel the pain.
Brainwash breaks You free. It seems, but it doesn't. Instead: makes you a slave deep in your heart. RUN! DON'T EVER LISTEN TO!

Liam Hemsworth you're a f****** idiot 😮 She is on the tippy top of her game right now. I became a Miley Cyrus fan when she sang  "say hello to heaven" and since that performance she's just gotten better and better.  Do you girl❤

I'm shocked she didn't look better!  great video clip, musically too!😊
There is something on the satirical side about Miley. She has a sense of humor.
She quickly turned into Dolly Parton light
Ai robot they lip sing over
Worse then the Hannah Montana episode about nazi’s
I love you ❤
She is really find herself!! She is sexy without being raunchy, like she was when she was younger. Not sure if she did that to just shock people or to get as far away from Hanna as she could 🤔. She has become a beautiful woman!! I wish her only the best ❤!!
Beautiful and very sexy 😍 😘  love you
Great Miley Cyrus 🎉
I miss Hannah Montana I want the chapters to continue I start crying because she and Eeta are so big
I love you @mileycyrus
This is total trash
I'm 53 but dayum she's hot now. More classy than 10 years ago.
I have never been a big fan but I did like several songs. But this is...this is a new level of Miley we never thought we needed and I'm happy she is shinning, happy and spread this confidence and joy. I'm a fan now
not a fan. i miss old Miley

Aging not just getting old, this lady getting elegant on stage. Want to see you on stage in Korea.
Hey baby I got endless problems my hips they hurt my face is in disaster I can't hardly know what has happened to hands it could take forever to tell you what is wrong with me.  Do have some patience and a lot of desire can I make you want just me can I make you always need me honey I got time.  What do you want to know in this world.  I could tell you about space and the stars but mostly I want to get all that off of you and get something private all night but I got to get all of you baby
Miley you’re everything ❤❤❤
Love this I think she's finally found herself the Grammy definitely cemented that for her
inspired by Sophia Loren
Świetny kawałek
Willow is amazing she has such a beautiful voice 😮  her music is amazing because she is so different than when she first started out with her first song whip my hair

Her teeth needs some fixing. I know it is veneers but it's just not fitting

Miley is amazing ❤
She made the history  she is the history
The best
I got your X message X blocked some of my posts.. ❤
Salut, tu es trop belle comment ne pas te aimé ❤bisous
This song gave me diarrhea and heartburn
I will say one thing! Dang! I want to have Miley’s arms that’s for sure!
Something tells me she'd be just as comfortable if she was totally nude and just as beautiful  😍
💩
идеально🥰
I like it Miley
Look like she tweaking like irl most likely 😂
You are so sweet and so kind ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉😊😂
Please help 🙏   Miley!!!  I don't think she reads messages. there are so so many! We could use help in many ways. My other half Jay is 65, has cerebral palsy, and we are poor and not even surviving in this miserable world! My Brother is 71 and going thru an eviction, he goes to court in August. He has zero money!!! What are people to do??  Thank you sooooo much!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Miley is Amazing ❤
i  think i feel  into a miley hole
She's a bad dancer. No grace and thick ankles. Just good advice around her. All bllshit

Die Frisur ist Scheiße, aber die Frau Klasse.
Does this mean she's back with Hamsworth after he cheated on her and she made billions of of flowers?
She has a beautiful voice, a nice face. Too bad she's pro-choice, pro-drug and leftist.
Very good
trash
She is herself and oringinal in everything she does
Love Miley, always reinventing herself

❤❤❤❤❤
This will convert in nuclear war .
The irony of singing a song called doctors when the medical system in Gaza is collapsed and medical staff have been systematically targeted and Miley Cyrus has been silent, meanwhile Pharrel has been a faithful supporter of israHell and its crimes, going as far as singing "happy" to IDF soldiers... Disgusting. Free Palestine
LIVE LAUGH LOVE MILEY CYRUS
what was pharrell thinking??? smh
Pure talent diva energy
That’s a masterpiece… Miley is so really Gorgeous and Majestic❤❤
Always a fan !! Love her music 🎶 🎵 ❤️

great 💘
YEAH LET ME WORK IT OUT!!! MY FAVORITE SINGER IN THE WHOLE WHILE WORLD!❤❤❤
My husband is obsessed with this song. Well, not obsessed but he told me he can’t get it out of his head. I told him that she is on his Freebie Five. I don’t mind, he can have a crush on Miley. I love her too. I think she’s awesome.
🫣😱😍😍
Yo solo vine pon un edit de gru conduciendo epicamente
This is the best she's been. I haven't been a fan but damn!

Hello beautiful Miley, I am your fan from Haiti. I follow you on YouTube, X,etc. I really appreciate every single work you performed. Your great honor when I know how good is your heart to help people. So please,would you help us with 2 sopranos sax 🎷 and a modern keyboard 🎹.🙏

GOOD MORNING my friend God always bless your family too
Yehhh
I just watched her on David letterman on Netflix the other day. She’s incredible 😃
Miley is such a delight to watch her entertain.  I have watched my kids grow up with her . She might be nasty to an extent. But who isn't??? She stays true to herself and she's not fake. She rocks whatever she does and she doesn't have to answer to anyone. She rocks!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤

Just came here to say that my gym plays this song all the time and it is one of the worst songs ever made. Crazy given the star power behind it. It’s lazy and not catchy at all.
Miley are you still leaving America if Trump Wins or are you happy with the evil pouring into this country destroying i9t from the inside out.
This sounds too much like “ I wanna be your slave-maneskin”😩😩😩😩

• • • •        Pharrell’s signature intro...
Miley Ray Cyrus is Japanese legend actress Mari Natsuki Similar🎉
She is SO F**king HOT!
You can really see the influence of Dolly in her now. I love it! The confidence, the hair teased to heaven, the playfulness, the strong feminine energy. I can’t get enough of this whole vibe! I see the Tina Turner reference too! Dolly, Tina, Miley can one of you teach me?!!
Miley power 🌹
She is so herself and I LOVE it 🎉🎉🎉
She puts tay tay to shame

Honestly love her attitude her ethics, fam values and she’s hot. Katherine, west of Ireland. You need to come to Dublin.
I love you baby.
Oh fuck moto hair :D
Love this look... ❤
She’s embarrassing, the only good song she did was flowers
..... R. I. P. - Tina Turner....
Na doctor
Wonderful song but this is too much of her going Tina Turner
the dancing and the arms reminds me of Shakira back in her prime for some reason, they look so free and that really translates into the visuals and music 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Magnifique !
I tried I really did
Tell dua i asked for divorce papers he got mad and said no
Taylor is too
I knew you were writing more music 😂
ليش هل غراء عندج صوة جميل ولا موهبة كدام الاغراء ماتسوا شي
Has a Tina Turner look to her in this get up.
Uma coisa que eu admiro na Miley alem do talento musical e voz é que ela sensualiza bem sem ser vulgar.
Are you related to Katya?! Gorgeous is an understatement, this song is my jam
Miley omg my idol❤
👍🏻👍🏻 💯      ✝️ 31
Damn she’s gorgeous!!!
Big hair looks fantastic on her
È quasi la copia dei Maneskin (I wanna by your slave) Pharrell perdi i colpi, che devi fare il verso di altri 😂 sono passati i tempi buoni.
❤ u Miley Cyrus our sister in Christ.. you are so blessed with God given  talent and hard work. Really love your music 🎶 🎶 . 🎵

Sorry, but this song is so great...
Minha preferida🥰💝💝💝💝💝💝💝

Shes always one step ahead
I’m obsessed with Miley atm,, I think she is amazing and super talented 🌟🌟🌟

Barbarella and Raquel Welch vibes.
Like the song a lot, and I like Miley but one of the worst music videos I have seen. Also, what is with the weird dancing? I don’t get it. To me it looks like someone who doesn’t know how to dance taught her to.
Boycotter ce mec... Il appuie les tout c est gouvernement de la honte... Son fric le rend débile... Il était a paris au diner de macron.... Ce mec est une honte....
This song supremely sucks
Can you sing rock for us pleassssse? Your voice was made for this, we love u
She is the best! ❤
She's so jacked! Girl been hitting the gym hard af for a bit now and it's showing ❤
Real Tina Turner vibe!
This is a bop. But good lord that woman has no fucking rhythm. 🤣🤣🤣
I'm in love with her
docter docter is a big hit you did it one more time miley
#thankyou #🫶 #Alwayslovedyourmusic #hopeyourdoingwellalways❤
A real trendsetter.
Unless he produced it. But like. His name being on there implies to me that he’s on the track as in. You’ll hear him sing on it at some point and he doesn’t. Still love the song though.
Why is Pharrell Williams credited on this song as a singer. You don’t see or hear him on track at all.
https://youtu.be/7xYooUAA8GA?feature=shared 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Soooooo good 🎉!!!!!
It's like she took Legally Blondes "Bend and Snap" and turned it into a music video
0:43  the dress is giving jojo siwa vibes 😭😭 great song tho 🫶🫶
💯❤️🤹
Alright Miley❤
Miley, I have 2 songs that you should record. Your voice is perfect for them.
The best!!!❤❤
miley in her gaga phase
❤❤
Even her hair looks so healthyyyyyyyyyyy goshhhhhhhh she is so beautiful!!! Her full hair so beautiful

Ozempic face
She is beautiful
Belleza
Love the tribute to tina
Este formato de blurred lines ya pasó de moda
i like this song
This seems like a Caucasian version of all the single Ladies by Beyonce.
It’s not as good as your other songs but still your a great singer ✅🤩✅🤩
Love the song, I think she looks like Jane Fonda in this video :)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love you Miley Cyrus  xxxx
Deadly   song 🎶🎶💜  like it Xxx 💙🎤😁  @ Miley Cyrus   🎉🎉🎉
Very Tina Turner
Cuerpazo!!! lo tiene todo!! 🤗🤗🤗🤗
That's was talking about climbing in the attic I hear voices, that's good one watching movies😁with you DJ doctor we trust on the payroll.
She can't sing she looks so fake it doesn't work for her
This song drives me crazy
Who is Drake? Pharrell has had arguably the biggest impact on music in the past 50 years. And the best part about it? Nobody knows this because he stays out of the spotlight. He’s the man behind so many hits by so many artists of ALL genres.
Be better, make the world better.  And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.  Exodus 22:16 kjv
I feel like this song was directed at me specifically, I love u too Miley lol
You got your style❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love this video ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ur beautiful
Your the one that done slapped a girl for no reason when she asked for a picture at a concert
Miley Total breakthrough in every dame aspect. Respect!!!
She is the very best version of herself here. I love this!
still think she is hannah montana 2024
This is given Ann Margaret in any movie she did with Elvis Presley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIi5jN06G3c&t=4s
I think the hair style kinda ruins the look
i wat you im just a kid and i love hannah montana
هلا مايلي شخبارس الصدق من زمان عنس
Tina Turner all over the place! Leaving Hannah Montana is the dust! Keep 'em comin, girl! Smoking mf hot!
HOW COULD YOU SLAP A PERSON ON THE FACE FOR NO REASON WHEN SHE WAS ASKING TO TAKE A SELFIE WITH YOU!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Lol 😂 wtf is this bs? She's losing it.
Mejor que nunca ❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
Ok sxs you
Can I have that dress?😅 I love it!!!🥰
❤😊🎉❤
I let you work it out Steven Gilbert Reinhart

Does anyone know if the first outfit is made by Bob Mackie?
Hair style is hilarious and the lyrics 😂😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤ Hare Šrí R se Radhé 👑💓💘💫🙏🌺🦚💎🔥🪔
I don't think she's talking about a normal doctor 🤔
mimo całej sympati do niej i podziwu talentu to ta fryzura koszmarna jak tina turner stara baba
Tattoos are dirty and ugly.such singers can be released every day.I don't see anything outstanding in her and her voice😅
A superstar and a camera. Thats all.
I keep coming back to check her out lmao
Why does look so different? looks frail like shes taking Ozempic, she got that ozempic face
Love it and if this comment gets 4 likes I will start a YouTube channel I swear
Miley is my spirit animal!
She’s so iconic
i really love the part with Pharell
La admiro desde cuándo era niña pero ahora es mi amor platónico es que es hermosa ya es mayor
Miley looks like a big star from the 80s 😍
I love this song, Miley is very histrionic, and what a voice...😜
Burner
❤
Miley can you do a new seeson from hannah montana pleas❤😊😊😇

This is a Maneskin😂
Livin Her best life ❤🎉

Love you miley :)
Imádom ezt a zenét!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS MILEYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Miley Turner!?
❤❤Miley
You move funny
i love you!!!
She is stunning!
Sounds like Maneskin’s song “Want to be your Slave”
Definitely when you don't know music, anything you sing is boring. I listened to this song three times and it makes me more bored than avocado and champagne.
Love the hair!!! Keep up the great work!❤❤❤
The world belongs to the brave
Oh yes, baby, don't stop
me gusta mucho 🤩
Wowww !!!  She is what very she is now..!!🤩
I just became a lesbian.
Por qué Pharrell no canta??
$$$
Beautiful lady with a beautiful voice and that brown mane,......wow gorgeous!
I am loving this track from Miley Cyrus as she has well and truly brought the Diva in herself alive. So Doctor (Work it Out) gets the usual 300/300 from me and it will get the special 900/900 on its 1st birthday whenever that will be.
I have the intuition that she will mark the history of music with her personality which never stops evaluating. She reminds me of Madonna, who never stops adapting. Before, I liked her less, but more and more, I love what she sings. She has matured and I approve, she now seems in agreement with herself. It's great!
We love you miley 💗
❤❤❤🎉😮😊
jst made this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak4bDNDEoD0
this song feels like a doctor seriously we all love this song
I feel like Doctor in this song  we are so in love with your entire song
*Miley is healing my soul.* she is a good doctor and nurse. ❤
*THIS SONG MOTIVATES ME TO GO TO THE GYM.*
Miley I designed your house with big bay windows and interiored the pebble house by the sunset love Warren Barr 3 her father
Me and Ari are almost in Malibu Cry cry Miley Montana please let me come for you like grind on
You just KNOW when you hear those signature Pharrell four beats at the start it’s about to hit hard 🔥
She rlly thought this was gonna be a hit💀
Hermosa canción y usted
She need a bangers 2.0, the first was a masterpiece ❤
Comman mis constipation is I'm sugar but it actually God's shield, like 300 movie formation is all I know for now they are fighting the dogs and protecting the good but it looks like sugar in reality it's not
fajny pastiż
A true star
Literally a bunch of generic preset samples put together.. 2 phenomenal singers need huge production.. this is weak funk..
Can we not pretend this is good?
Sounds like manakin
So... every letter needs to be spoken with half your tongue out? I'm learning english wrong then
Tina turner and dolly Parton mixture ❤❤❤
Beautiful Lady love all her songs God bless you always ❤❤❤
Peace Love Cool RFD Israel *.

i really tried but ... there's nothing i like about this song or music video art direction. they can't all be bangers, i guess...
You can ruin this song with one letter change. “You’re my (B)rother”
maybe this is a really specific and completely unprompted complaint. but. the whiteness of Miley’s teeth is super off putting.

My 28 yr old has adored Miley since they wete kids. My daughter first saw her in the movie Big Fish. Then saw her on her dad's shoe Doc. Actually I saw her on the nashvielle network before her movie
Que mujeraza apezar de todos las criticas ella sabe reinventarse, que fuerza de mujer,  adelante miley  que vamos por  el otro grammy  y te esperamos en colombia cantando flowers  en español asi como ese  show en brasil.
Boy did miley cyrus grow up. All the way from the feed up. Very very grown up and sexy. Winner, Is definitely a winner. Don't take my opinion check it up for yourself. You're like it
Pharrel Williams vocals were really good. Can't stop replying his verse.  Dead silent however
Miley,a love you ❤️
Miley,a love you ❤️
Can we say lip sync?

Where the heck was Pharrell Williams though?
Tina Turner and Beyonce vibes! 😎🤩🔥

Love this song Steven Gilbert Reinhart
Cancionsota
I hate her 👍🏻🫡
Natural superstar
I think these are Miley's very best years!  She is bringing back the 50's, 60's and 70's kind of sexy and I really like her like this! 💋💋💋❣❣❣
Road runner to take one of the little groundhogs and the rest of the crown the hogs chased him off . It's your fact

Great Entertainter  2:47 2:48 2:55  & singer
Realy?
make up can only make you look pretty on the outside but it doesn't help if you ugly on the inside. Even if you eat the make up. You are beauty without❤
love you sunshine ❤ i may be a poor man but when i hear you sing I'm the richest man alive
‭Romanos 10: 8-11  8 Mas ¿qué dice? Cerca de ti está la palabra, en tu boca y en tu corazón. Esta es la palabra de fe que predicamos: 9 que si confesares con tu boca que Jesús es el Señor, y creyeres en tu corazón que Dios le levantó de los muertos, serás salvo.  10 Porque con el corazón se cree para justicia, pero con la boca se confiesa para salvación.  11 Pues la Escritura dice: Todo aquel que en él creyere, no será avergonzado.

Thank you for the fantastic video! I made a cover of this song. I'd love it if you could give it a listen ❤ https://youtu.be/UB2kG4xjihM
This song reminds me of Maneskin's I wanna be your slave 😕

Woow
Hello bb my love
My love Miley bisous mon amour
I love this Song 😍 Summervibes
Hannah Montana rock vibes🤘🏼
Miley needed one outfit, a fur coat, light hairstyle and a fan to shoot a gorgeous video. Nothing extra, just the crazy energy of a beautiful woman - Miley
I love Miley and never thought I'd have anything negative to say butttt... I'm getting shades of an old time country singer with the new hair.
Please Help  Sherif Gaber he have a channel on YouTube and he is in Egypt now, He has been suffering for years and now he is crying. We do not know anything about him. Please, you have a strong voice and help Sherif Gaber. Just because of his ideas, they treated him badly. Please support Sherif Gaber.

We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark. The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light❤🥰😍😘
That Women never dissapoint.
I like Hannah Montana 😊
The cost for this video was 10$.
Shes only 31? Why she looks 55?
Miley Cyrus es muy talentosa y graciosa. Me encantan todas sus canciones y en esta uff 🎉. Tienes el mundo a tus pies.
Miley Cyrus did this over ten years ago and you definitely ain't no Miley babe
Måneskin‘s „i wanna be your slave“ sends greetings
Honest at first I thought it was lame, but nowww. Heck yes this song is awesome
I`m leaving this comment here because after a month, year, decades if someone like this comment i get reminded this song
I pray for you too loyyour music
...
She looks like Sindel from Mortal Kombat with that hair and I’m here for it!
Sounds like Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE 🫣🤫🤔 https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=WZaEUi8v_2V3pq6O
My brother was like ark ukh!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤ i love this song is sow lonely
Why nobody blame her that she is copying Beyonce here
Super glad she released this beautiful unreleased song that sadly didn’t make it on bangerz 💞
😊 I think I need a doctor
Let me work it out when o can see u in person
Doctor doctor i have a fever can u kiss and rub my belly with vicks
I love her voice and her aptitude, thanks for the tribute to the 80s... and last 70s well done.
Would enjoy hearing a Gospel song! Jesus loves you Miley
❤❤❤Miley Cyrus es mía toda ❤❤❤❤salu2 mi princesa hermosa ❤❤❤❤❤
Miley is almost unrecognizable.    She looks so different in the face.   Please keep away from plastic surgery girl.
Great
Miley > Taylor
Sarah, if you see this. I’m still into you.
I wish she would do a cover of "Ohio" by The Pretenders. Christie Hynde was a rebel too.
pharells 4 count start :D
tyr rex utube.  Love MIley.
Although im a much older generation and watched her grow, Miley is one of the few young artists that I still can completely relate to, she has that olf fashion genuine rebellious glow in her eyes that I remember only seeing in young Madonna, she seems very focus but equally spontaneous, like someone that you can go out to have fun with but will be equally entertained by just share a bottle of wine and have a conversation, that internal drive can make her go very far ( in this video she gives totally Young Jane Fonda in Barbarella )
Oh that hair!!! miley is amaazing!
U look smoking hot in tour film clip omg  i love u lol
Far musica  per business.
🤍✨🌊
So proud of her. That’s it.
She's too gorgeous.❤ The hair is so Rogue from the X-MEN. 😍
Algo me dice que ya le bajaron vistas , iva muy fuerte esta cancion. Lo mismo con flowers no a avanzado en vistas.❤❤❤❤
⭐️ ❤
She is beautiful, magnificent, and this song is contagious, I loved it😍😍😍
I love you
I love me some miley 💓 😍...but this song is wacknezz....straight garbage 🗑
Maneskin I wanna be your slave from 2 years ago

Return Return Jenisha ❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Return Restore ❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
i wasnt a huge fan of miley, but the dancing, the outfit, the vocals, i am here for it
where is Pharrel Williams??
i like this new version of miley
I think she has fake teeth which can explain why she talks funny
Are those her teeth? She's very nasal too.
Lol her hair is too big for her body. Love the dresses but it looks like she is playing in her mother's closet. They are trying too hard too trying to make her look like a grown woman.
Metgala 2024 and you didnt get there :(
❤
This is literally a mix of all her previous sound eras I'm obsessed
Fuckin 🔥 Pharrell ×Miley
Cliche to write Too many imitations Heartbreak infinite and expanding Love is trust Work is lying Both at home On call Just always The truth diminishing Words turn to terms Love is drowning  Day to day Same as anybody Too stubborn I'm being Everyone is saying Here I am alone Clean and unchanging  Life ever persistent  In constant exchanging Lost to the heat The heat ever lost Memories designed to deceive Fix any incongruencies  Ever always everyone Ever insist on what I be The dove flying Lay accusing me of changing Covering the sweat of denial Of the adverse effect always straining An entourage engaging Misinformed revenge hiding I am innocent That is worse That is the problem That is the source of all this complaining In my sadness all I hear you saying I make noise true as angels  My song to society is as nothing Burnt by wish Denyed by experimenting A death bed shrug  Disorder paying Make make make Self creating False idols all Not I so forsaken Lame the compass needle To all this idol hand shaking Yet never once the compass breaking As threads themselves are a' weaving And the knuckles yeast a cracking garlic kneading A garland wreath of nooses tightining Stiff upper lips A loss of forms disdained and remaining Still in silence so loud  Resounds over the din Persistent love Shine soul Hope to GOD not they or I faking Hold on The nightingale's song The Phoenix's freedom A box of oblivion  Never her or anyone Channels of rain cloud the moon To fight purposelessly for the favour of the sun We are all to all of time A tiny thought With the wisdom of children too far grown Exposure is information Yet offered in love The silent request for none No moon for this sun No rain for the kingdom Stolen by bandits Filth and occultists Like everything else The world of man's barbs of distortion Send angels to hell in twisted perception  A weavers forge of blame Bound by shame and excusing Judge me I say In all that is everlasting  Not this strife of now's good intentions  You too with no claim I am still affording House turns away home For home ever searching Self pity and disinterest  Boredom and avoidance What else is there? So all are all using What else is there? Others fools trying What else is there, But GOD and dieing?
She's quite thin nowadays but she does seem really happy 😊
I love this song
Miley looks and sounds so good!
This is actually so fun
Love Miley Cyrus❤
This sounds like megan trainor turned it down lol i mean the song not her voice. Shes gotten better with her vocals
Her hair 😅😂
Maneskin? 💀
❤❤❤Miley Cyrus ❤me gusta como cantas ❤me gustan tus videos ❤y no sabes cuanto te amo mi amor kiero estar contigo mi vida ❤kiero estar en tus brazos mi amor ❤❤❤❤salu2 ❤❤❤PD nomas contigo mi princesa hermosa ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
and where is Pharell Williams?
Notice how she doesn’t close her mouth a single time in this video. Like she just hangs it open
Hard to find a sexier woman than her.
I remember how many people made fun of her. She's enjoying her life and being herself. Thats what I love about her.
I like her energy here. And damn, she's sexy. I've never been a fan of hers but I like this Tina Turner vibe and she does have a unique voice.
I love u Miley Cyrus 🩷🎀✨
sample from Maneskin?
This is so perfekt 😮
She has committed a crime for showing how extremely beautiful she is here.
jojo vives
The drugs impair her reasoning.  She is under the influence of greed and corporations and the threat of imprisonment for breaking her contract.
This is such a gooddd songg 😍
I saw a remix with Miley and Eminem and i wonder how a fukn perfect fukd up couple would they be
I love to you Miley Cyrus, I like you music
Now Is a real woman ,but where Is Pharrell Williams 🙃
Miley I’m sorry but can’t u go back to your old self like your Hannah Montana self I miss the old Miley the OG Miley
She must workout.  😍
*Tina Turners  dress style. And it is not bad, we need to remind old artists memory so they can stay alive.*
*Miley has a great body. She is on shape!! And looks  happy and  lovely charismatic woman.*
*I love this song* ❤❤ LET ME WORK IT OUT!
Shred addictive ,,,,,,:::,,,
her teeth are way too big for her face, also she looks so old.. terrible :( the brainwashing in hollywood over looks is really something else
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wouch li sanblé a an fanm folle 🎉🎉😊
Ее тут портит прическа в стиле 80-х. Зачем вообще она постоянно лезет в эту эпоху с ее роковым голосом, которым она поет попсу? Какофония какая-то.
guuuurl! slay, divorce looks good on you!
Here true form- yes, mediocrity.  I love the multiple close ups of the perfect capped teeth and gums. What a star. Please. This is a mediocre singer with very little talent.  The flushing of a distant toilet is more interesting. Yawn.
She's stunning, but she could enhance her arm tone a bit
Damn Miley Cyrus you’ve been growing strong fort sins 14 years ago 14 years ago, your arms were thin. Your arms are awake have muscle definition and also can you do a redo of this song? It kinda sounds a little funny.
Cada día más hermosa por dios ❤❤
Buenas 😂😂❤❤
Wow!
Why does this song reminds me always of maneskin - Wanna be your slave?   https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=W0hgoFO0yfGCvUSC
She reminds of a young Jane Fonda
https://youtube.com/shorts/JROn75G92hY?si=Sb3qt0vcL6oZqamk
This song is a bit of a rip off at the beginning from Domiano David's song but it's cool
I wanna see her play a country icon in a biopic
Pretty good when Kim kard has to have your man and Beyonce, the " queen" releases  the dolly song you covered.  See how that worked out for them. Lol!!
it's very similar to the Måneskin song "i wanna be your slave"
Pharrell's magic is totally evident on this track. 🎉
Why is this video 3 hours long
This girl will go in hell
LOVE her.
it,s a copy of " i wanna be your slave " of italian group " Maneskin"
❤️🎶💉🎧
Tina Turner would killed this song!
This one doesn't do it for me. Kinda creepy.
swifties, this is talent #SorryNotSorry
🌸
miley is so gorgeous and taleneddddddddd
She has a Tina Turner look with the outfit and big hair
Милашка ❤
Miley just brought and updated Tina Turner for Gen Z
What a fake ass shit. Why do people gravitate towards this thing.
Excellent performance. She's a standout all by herself
After FLOWERS no one can stop her climbing to the new Queen of pop contemporary music ❤️ She is again number 1.
🔖Excelentes Miley, saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪🙋🏻
💖💖💖☄️☄️☄️
She’s so beautiful 😭💘💘
She so hot
2 months na pala after ng nangyari sa akin ah? Dami ko shinare ng panahon na yun. Pero ito pa rin ako, ako pa rin may kasalanan at baliw. Galing diba? Tandaan niyo, si Jesus mag-isa namatay at walang tumulong sa Kanya ng napako sa krus. Kaya kahit marami kayo pero kung mali ginagawa niyo, hindi pa rin kayo tatanggapin sa taas. Sino pa ang magnanakaw na nakapako sa krus, sila pa umakyat at yun pa pinagkatiwalaan ni Jesus na magbabago. Napakabuti ni Jesus talaga na hindi tulad ni Mhel
Blue suits you best 🥰🩵🩵🩵🩵
❤❤❤
Great voice miley
🎉❤
Stitches was right bout Molly Cyrus
Me encanta tu canción Miley. I love your song Miley.❤❤❤
This fina looks like dentist ads
hannah montana is that you!? 🤤
Makes slim trained people great again
Pharrell has a way of bringing the funk out of any singers voice
Don't know what it is that makes that thing so catchy.    Just one thing an old dude like me would like to criticise....  Not even real criticism   But I'd like to hear it sung from Iggy Pop😊😂❤
My nation you will find ppl like song and another ppl worry
The best 👌
I love this video! She’s wild and free and hot and can dance! Miley has so much talent!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I never like Miley Cyrus before her most recent album. She’s possibly one of my few favourite current singers next to Christina. I really enjoy her new music style
Miley’s dance in this MV reminds me of Cameron Diaz from “The Mask”
It's similar to I wanna be your slave by manekind
Какая она бомбезная!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is this MV so addictive. Miley looks stunning!! YOU GO GIRL!!
Ela se transformou numa artista fora de série... fantástica!🇧🇷❤️
People are hating on this song for nothing.. It's fun and makes you wanna dance like a good pop song should!!!
Luv Miley~ her look reminded me of Jane Fonda from the 1980’s

I don't care about famous people one bit but I really like Miley. And I enjoy her work very much.  You are going to be one of the few artists who is remembered in your era.
Jane Fonda, é  você?
Que onda con sus dientes😂
I love this song ❤
Música ridícula! Não fosse as músicas fazendo acusações contra o ex marido continuaria sumida.
Cool song and handsome woman! But sorry Miley, the tattoos are really ugly!!!
Who is the video director? Great job! UPDATE: Director: Jacob Bixenman, and all the rest of the crew. Lyrics in the video notes too. I could use some "working out" right now. LOL but true!
Wow! Now this is a REAL video... Hair, dress and Miley... oo la la, nothing more is needed! Girl, you have come so far from Wrecking Ball, and you can go back and forth as much as you like. Wowee-Zowee!
Miley Cyrus... WOW! Barbarella and Jane Fonda today!
all those surgeries make her look like a 20 year old dolly parton.
When you see britney
Boring
Måneskin did better she got such a Average deep boring voice
Anyone else see Jane Fonda in the 70s? Cat Ballou  meets Barbarella 😁🥰 So fit and beautiful 😍
Magnifique  au top ....
🎉Ini video saya dibikin video miley cyrus oleh tim timbaland makanya timbaland dan timnya dibantai imam mahdi,syaikh hamdan almakhtoum. Mey pratidina nursin. Putri Allah azza wa jalla.
Lol and Jojo out here acting like she's any kind of icon. This is Hannah Montana🤣 Lil Jojo needs to take a big step down😂
Excelente tono de voz
best coogate advertising
The Whig is from Dolly Parton and the dress from Tina Turner?
Giving Tina Turner
I freaking love it.
Cornerstone. Capstone.
Good job Miley. Hope you like it.
Forever and always my crush
Great song but stolen: https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=c6NvsBj95iGLlCOs
What did Pharrell Williams do?
She is so hot. 😊😊😊😊
Queen
Für mich ne Mischung aus „I wanna be your slave“ von Måneskine und „happy“ von Pharell Williams. Meiner Meinung nach nix neues
Miley the power woman!!👍
I would love to see a collab between her & harry styles
Miley is KILLING IT!!! I T thought FLOWERS was incredible, and her Grammy performance was one of the best I've ever seen. I thought a follow up was going to be difficult and disappointing. Man, was I wrong! I love the song, i love the video, love the blue fur-and most of all her dancing and attitude.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿...
Work It Out!!!
https://youtu.be/0p2Sfrn6N6c
https://youtu.be/0p2Sfrn6N6c
https://youtu.be/0p2Sfrn6N6c
Tina hubo una sola. Sé más original
Vibe de mulher Poderosa. Powerful women!
MIleys worst song ever
Can we talk about how BEAUTIFUL and SHINNING Miley is in this video??  Miley has become the best version of herself lately! The most talented and charismatic artist IN THE WORLD! This is pure perfection, just like her 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Love that volume. She should stick with that hairstyle for a while.
How many did she order and famous me? Pod Dolly
Oh totally good song from the future
Będziesz drugą Madonną❤
What in the sweet Tina Turner
I love Miley, but do they have to make her act like she is an old lady trying to look young... Wtf... I miss the real Miley crazy and fun...
She is amazing 😍
<3
This is HER LOOK.
I love your music ❤❤🎉🎉
Gosh I love Miley!!

Lots of love Miley
Something happens my phone hasn't been ringing
I showed my councilor at turning point on first that someone like what I commented on to you
😐
I literally came from Jojo wawa karma shit to wrecking to this video as seeing who evolved better, Milley went from an era of hannah montana to crazy wrecking ball now to this beyonce style look literally love this iconic look.
In my opinion she's not a typical beauty but I jut can't stop staring😂
When I grow up, I want to be just like Miley. (I’m 54) This woman is wickedly talented and always looks like she’s having a ball.
the director for this video and whoever came up with the choreography should be fired immediately.
Gata, extremamente gata.
I adore Miley Why? She is authentic and has this deep, amazing voice Her duets especially with Dolly Parion and Melanie are incredible and her aura is divine!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh shit! Holy crap, that’s kinda fun!
This incredible work was destroyed by the bastardisation of Tina's legacy.
YOU AMORAL PERSON BROKE UP WITH ME TO BE COOL AND EVERYONE STILL DOESN'T WANT YOU!!!
Giving MILF vibes and under 35

I could be your doctor Я можу бути тобі лікарем. And I could be your nurse І я можу бути тобі медсестрою. I think I see the problem Мені здається, що я бачу проблему.

In alcuni parte assomiglia tremendamente a I wanna be your slave dei Maneskin. 😮
Alter ist das schlecht
this is terrible
I love her new look, style and attitude. She rocks . Go Girl❤❤❤
Pharrell knows how to make hit songs with Miley
.
Te amo miley 🧡 🇨🇱

She  grew up  finally,  better than before
Enviably perfect... ;)
She is definitely one of the sexiest women in the world
Wow I am an old girl if she takes me out of my dark place for sure I broke my neck in 2013 wow

Miley needs to stop dancing she looks like a meth addict
Those tattoos looks so tacky. Yuck. I regret getting a tattoo on the back of my leg, but I was so young back then and luckily its the only one I ever got. Would never again get a tattoo.
Stunning ❤
Came here to search 🔍 Wrecking Ball '😊
New song for my running playlist
♥
Yeah....Love you girl
hello❤miley
Más vigente que nunca
Wow her face is unfortunate. And totally stole the song from Maneskin.
❤
Good song miley 😁👍🏻🎶
I was hoping for this song to become such a massive hit. It’s been a month and nothing? This is way much better and catchier than “Flowers” What’s happened? Thoughts? Any one?
Miley ❤
This and "Flowers" and her performance at The Grammys ... Miley has proven all we need to see is Miley, a mike, And a stage !!! Miley has come into her own!!!! And she is bringing a Tina Turner vibe with her !!!
❤
❤
Pretty Epic!! ❤🎉
Everything she touches lately is GOLD.  MIdas Miley!!
Spain comes on very strong this year. Each of the top songs in Benidorm festival are pretty much potential winners for this year's Eurovision, so warm and edgy 🇵🇹👌
Reál miley fans click here 👇
I'd like to see Miley be even more herself,...a country girl singing .." Take this job and shove it! I don't work here anymore!"  And  not have to bow to any one!
I miss old Miley.. u look beautiful when u r kid
Her legs is good for modeling ❤ So flawless and beautiful
Es mi imaginación o está hermosura de mujer se parece a angelina Jolie, las dos hermosas y talentosas
Love You mileyy
She's like a mix of Vanessa Williams and tina turner in this video!
Abra paso que llego la Diosa Divina Hannah Montana👏👏👏 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
She got Sindel vibes. Don't question me.

I don't know if she looks 12 or 60 !
This song is Miley’s continuation of Come Get It Bae in my head
Even Taylor Swift doesnt manage to oust Miley .
Miley is the best woman in the world for me .🥇
Miley is gold and diamond 🥇💎
Miley is great..........Good on you.
When listening to it, I start dancing on my hospital office desk 💃🕺💃🕺 anyone else ? 😉
einfach nur Mega. Es macht einfach Spaß ihre Songs die zum Tanzen einladen, anzuhören. Der Song ist pure Unbeschwertheit und Freude und Miley bei sich angekommen!

Giving me a Megan Trainor vibes.... 😕😕
Bullshit :(
teeth!!
Crazy how none of you see how much she is trying to be Tina Tuner. talking about Miley becoming the best version of herself. lolololololololol
Sexy
0000000009999999000000000 NICE 0000000000009099999999
diosa del olimpo. diva . ninfa
It’s a Colgate commercial
Those close ups of her mouth are such a delight 😋
I love Miley so much her song is so good
❤
I want all of you all the time
She seems really in her flow
My baby momma
Absolutely gorgeous! So proud of Miley and who she has become. ❤
bro ur not shakirah .. HEE HEE
Awwwwwwesome!
Is it just me or shes going through a Tina Turner phase?
Great Pharrell 🎉
This song is sooooooo bad yall are delulu
Girl, the Tina Turner vibes..... YOU look freaking amazing and that voice. QUEEN!!! <3
Miley needs to get a better hairdresser. Other than that she is great.
Miley is incredible ❤❤
Meravigliosa creatura
No me gusta ese look de Miley
Her teeth! She could eat an apple through a letterbox.
That Jeffrey Epstein picture is not doing you anything good
We need a new album stat
Sounds like Maneskin....
Is this another blurred lines or a response?
This song gives me "Blurred lines" vibes.
she is FIT! ugo Mileygo!
I  ca/enjoy her vid. all day. "FLOWERS!"
Måneskin?
Miley still looking good & my boy still got it Pharrell🔥
Beautiful Miley
💃🕺🎉🎉👍👍👍
WHAT IS HER WORKOUT ROUTINE
I wasn’t a miley fan and i certainly did NOT enjoy her trying-too-hard-to-be-sexy-and-shocking phase, which hit an all-time low at the infamous performance of “blurred lines” with robin thicke with her skin toned tight leather(?) bikini, which produced countless memes of her as a plucked chicken. But seeing her performance at the grammy’s changed my opinion of her. She’s confidant, energetic, truly carefree about what others think of her, and less self-conscious of trying to please ppl or trying too hard to be something she’s not. AND she can sing. So congrats on another catchy new song and another music video with just plain, simple good music and wholesome self.
Miley i really love you from since I'm 16 years old  even  now I'm 23 and  still loving you❤ you're a great singer ❤
She ripping of the maneskin “I wanna be your slave” song
Ok. MANESKIN cover😂
9 out of 10 dentists recommend this video
Why are her teeth so big
i see BARBARELLA.
Her face looks really beautiful 🌞
D!MN SY..............I JUST BURST..........AND IT IS EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!.......IS IT TO LATE FOR YOU TO WORK IT OUT????????????????....I'M JUST ASKING........LOL.......ICON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.......ICON....IC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....TIMELESS ARTIST.......
Queen
She shine on Timbaland beat ,She can do the same on a Pharrell beat.
She's electric.   I don't think I've ever said that about anyone before I don't even think I've ever put those two words in a sentence together lol
I really like this song ❤❤❤
Faz um feat com Anitta  vai ter chuva de comentários
Literally can’t take my eyes off of her😍 she is so stunning
Hell yeah! 🤘🏻🔥
She's better than this goofy music. Love, love, love Miley but this song is goofy and unmemorable.
this whole video is so 60-80's style lol, big fluffy coat, big puffy wild hair, sparkly outfits, the dance moves, hell the beat of the music is very 70's. the kids on tik tok hating don't know anything honestly lmao.
Why she looks like 65 years old? I thought she was younger than me
No me gusto mucho la canción pero veo que ella se encontró a si misma ❤
Addicted to miley cyres
Such groovy
😅😊 that's funny
Shes such a goober she's just having fun and I love it
Is it only me who thinks it's Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE copy ???
Hi Miley I am you biggest fan I have see your Hannah  Montana  all episodes
So sexy uhhhm
This part of the video (0:58) reminds me of the RuPaul's "Supermodel of the World" album cover
That HAIR!
Nice lovely
She is phenomenal in this song!!!
I believe this is the best Miley she is so talented and I like it when she just sings and not screaming
What shit music. Holy fuck.
Mikey needs a professional dancer to improve her skills.
@flujokarmikodelamor
I love the energy she has
Bella canzone
A voz dela é incrível ❤❤❤ 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yoooooo....she is fyah!
That 4 beat start for Pharrell the best
She’s a STAR ⭐️, she shines all on her own! ❤
Amazing Miley, like always ❤️
Ela se divertindo ❤
Una Miley decisamente cresciuta , che si mostra come possibile donna per la vita ideale, però parla sempre di una notte,🤷🏻‍♂️ quindi di un qualcosa di passeggero,destinata a chi non vuole una lunga storia, difficile che un 45 enne desidererebbe eventualmente solo questo.. canzone molto orecchiabile con giuste vibes piccanti👏🏼😘
Nah she don’t need any back up dancers
So complete and pretty human being (inside and out), she has it all figured out, love her.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just like seeing her smile like this. I hope she had fun filming. Her muscles are awesome. Very inspiring
Quanto vorrei che faresti un video mentre stai sott acqua con la sensualità che hai, batteresti ogni record ❤
She looks so happy 🥲
no megusto ek tenma
It’s iconic
OMG I absolutely freakin LOVE THIS NEW MILEY!!! YOUR TINA MARIE  made over and as beautiful as can be glamour's ❤❤ Your songs are VERY VERY GOOD!!! I love this video as well! 😍
Tina Turner she’s not. LOL
aquí me siento como estrella baby  quizás sientas lo que siento yo 💖✨
I wanna cry seeing so many people finally giving Miley all the love she always deserved 🖤
This is so addictive 🙌

Miley, your body is like poetry in motion. Your hips dance like leaves in the wind, and your gaze attracts like a magnet. Your lips are like forbidden fruit and your movements are graceful and sensual. You are like a star on the red carpet, exuding sex appeal and charm. May your energy and beauty constantly delight the world!❤❤❤
wow, those are nice teeth.

Amazing as always
This feels like her most authentic and happiest self. She is glowing
This is CRINGEY AF!! Seems like shes trying to make the dance go viral and unfortunately it probably will😑😑😑😑
Miley Nicki collab.
It’s giving Beyoncé 🤍
He broke up with me for clout and he is still a FLOP and UNWANTED
Tf😂is she challeneling Beyonce twenty years ago?
I think she's proving how great of an entertainer she is ,, it's one of the best and hot acts I've seen in a while.. just awesome baby.  Keep.up.the great work.. lady and don't cut no slack show them all what time it is.. its Mileys time  that's what time it is..go baby go.
Miley got some killer abs and legs ❤❤❤❤
Damn… she fine as hell ❤
❤
I think I missed Pharrell singing his part😂😅
your Rash loves you sdint worry
Rip miley
I don't think u realised how much I've watched this
I just found out today that Miley Cyrus was Hannah Montana 🙀
Just don’t understand these typical female type of standards she’s feeding into with the extreme perfect hair skin and what not She once was against those things and about being herself and now she’s feeding into those old old standards more then a lot of people nowadays do  But if that’s what makes her happy I just  hope we can see that we should be ourselves rlly
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
stunning queen
she served
i need a doctor appointment to miley
she is so hot
It's like She's Risen like a Phoenix; comfortable at Last! 'Cos I saw Slight "Hannah Montana"-vibes😻💚
Ha! Is that a cover of Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE?
She looks like she is having fun
❤
Is this a parody?
I see why this tune did not perform that good on charts. It sounds like an aerobics song. Sorry, Miley, I'm not feeling this one 😢
That hairstyle makes her look 50
Hermosa chica... Fabuloso sus 3 vestuarios, van de la mano con el estilo musical y el ritmo, ademas sus expreciones fasiales son fabulosas que le dan esa magia al cantar...con eso su voz y su baile es sensual dando las ganas y deseo de que el expectador se ponga a Bailar y sacar esos pasos prohibido con tal musica y ritmo. Felicidades para ti Mujer dichosa en virtudes.❤❤❤
It's a shity song
Agradecido de que Miley reparará la canción y mejorarla ♥️♥️♥️😭😭😭🙏🏻
Im not a Miley Cyrus fan at all but she totally Nailed this! Gave me Shania Twain-ish vibes. I love it! catchy song and she looks great ❤️
I love u, you are my crush❤
It's a good time to write public enemy, go deep that's what everyone wants
Eres increíble e imparable Miley, nunca lo olvides ❤
I like this video.
I have an uncomfortable obsession with her legs. In another life she could be a leg model.
I love this song
Hot fox
This does sound very Pharrell.
The problem with this sound not being hit was Pharrell.   He just isn't really relevant anymore.
Miattad félek
His movements make me nervous
🦍🦍🦍🥰🥰🥰💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍👼👼👼
Miley is a Grammy winner now this is the celebration song for us fans🤩
Mayli lovjų
PHARRELL JUST DOESNT HAVE IT/
😊 1:54
Heard it on the radio Honestlt forgot she got such a bouncy voice Good job Miley
So where was Pharell in any of that???
❤❤❤❤
Amo este video Miley ...... Me encantan tus canciones , esta canción debe ganar un Grammy ..... No entiendo porque ahora reconocen tu enorme talento y porque ahora te premian cuando debieron hacerlo desde siempre . Espero de todo corazón que ganes muchísimos Grammys te lo mereces por tu gran talento. Ademas deseo que regreses con Liam y sean felices esta por siempre ....... Se te ve feliz Miley ahora últimamente, pero ese corazoncito tuyo esta triste porque anhela a Liam nuevamente y de todo corazón espero regresen y hablen y dejen todo lo malo en el pasado y se amen con antes . Tu y el han de tener mas buenos recuerdos que malos y eso lo saben ustedes, asi que no esperen a que el tiempo siga pasando . REGRESEN ❤ .
Tina Turner vibes!!!💚
Pharrell?? It's all Miley and that's all it needs.
She's better than taylor shit!
Pharrell clearly wrote this. She's signing in his cadence ❤ I would like to Skateboard's demo version of this!
I love Miley and she is very very fierce and a wonderful singer but her dancing is a little questionable LOL, but granted she is wonderful and she can sing magnificent
You’re so pretty! 😍
Hi Friend I Got An Art Piece for u El Pintor Zen Ruckus
Sorry ya existe tina tourner
I need her old rock-style comeback 🤓🤓🤓
Omg I love it ❤
I just love her husky voice ❤
Eyyow
I think she working about her naxt album in this days in that gonna be in this vibes.
Better than Taylor Swift.
😢 Lass mich Leben bisschen mit meine Hunig
to me, it looks like she was trying way too hard!!.....she CAN sing!! song is okay. editing of this video is BAD....take out the stupid close-ups of lips and show more Miley. dancing around could have been much better......maybe Miley needs a new team to work with!!! her songs form HM and her earlier solo music was better than this song!!! just keeping it real.......
Badass❤
Pharrell is the best producer ever
😢 не очень
👇🏾 tap here if you’re a real Miley fan
No backup dancers, no musicians, no crazy effects. Just Miley! You go girl! Love ya since the Hannah days!  Keep it real sister!
Insupportable cette femme 😂 cest genant lol je comprend mieux son copain elle est trop vulguaire.... Vicieuse et pretentieuse. Tu te crois belle en te comportant ainsi tu me fait pitier ma pauvre honte a toi tu merite pa un mec aussi classe il est trop bien pour toi !!!
I love u miley ❤
I love you❤❤❤❤
Love
Shoutout to Trixie Mattel for choreographing this song 😂
🔝💫🥇🫴🏻🔥
Not me waiting for Pharrell's voice 😢
She's talking about being a drug addict
Cringe
❤
She has her own style i love that!!❤❤❤ hugs from Chile
Amo a Miley Cyrus
Please be my doctor ❤
I love you ❤
Miles looks nothing short of incredible in this video, but the song isn’t for me this time 😢
YAAAAAAAS... Wafer thin beauty... Wow ... The discipline she has !!!👌👍🌬️💕💕🥰
❤❤❤
The older she gets the more she looks like cher. Not positive imho
والله حلوة 😂😂❤
for while i thought it BLURRED LINES
Que mujer ….
Go, Miley
I love you Miley 😊
It’s giving Tina Turner
She is a real artist. More than Tylor Swiff (this girl is just a commercial brand). Every single song of Miley is something original, unexpected and full of perfect tunes.
She looks so different now 😭
Silly simple sticky song 😢 low budget video
Pero que monumento de mujer...
I wish I could be famous just to see my daughter's dream come true, helping our kids makes us parents.❤
I love her so much.
❤❤❤❤
1:35 thisss 🤩🤩
Why am i getting a Jane Fonda vibe 😂😂😂😂
How is listening to it in April me me me tell me now  Work it up💪
I just love how much fun she’s having it’s contagious 😂 and this beat is so catchy
Mileysaur
"If thats something that you wanna do" reminds me of her song "on my own"
https://youtu.be/ts171d2-IrI?si=JMxO_vWpinilR6gm
Pharrells Production is so iconic, now im compelled to listen to Justin, Usher, Robin, and Gwen Stefani today
OK c'est vrai.
J'avoue que elle bouge bien... Et j'ai envie de juste dansé avec elle un phantasme non qui peut accompagné miley pas grand monde 😂 alors moi je dis encore une fois OK pas de soucis. Mais je respect. La personne qu'elle est... Jamais pour son physique ou son argent... Juste qu'elle danse avec quelqu'un de neutre. Et je vais prend plaisir et elle aussi salut la paix dans le monde.
No MANESKIN mash up?
This is drag this is stunning
✌️✌️✌️
Love this video!! Miley is giving Tina Turner vibes with that amazing dress and hair!!
Coreographiy not very good
La canción que no sabía que necesitaba
That song kinda sounds like this one. 😳  https://youtu.be/Wc8iql5gBj4?si=Mdq8ABZ6dc-gA4tL
Perfeito!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is such a fun song!!!!
La canción con Allison Sheapard
Isn't this the Grammy dress she left her underwear home for?
Totally garbage song, deplorable how bad it is
Liam is missing out 😘
Confidence
A mi me encanta que hizo todo un video con un fondo liso, ella bailando con un ritmo y un magnetismo impresionante. Una reina!!   Después están los cantantes mediocres que necesitan poner treinta autos de lujo, una piscina y cuatro minas en bolas para que el video sea "atractivo". Aprendan💅🏻
amei o cabelo, a roupa e  a dança estranha kk me identifiquei
Major Tina Turner vibes in that video. ❤
Pansexual Queen 👑 💖💛💙
She looks like the female version of the joker. Like her face is literally built like his😭😭😭💅
❤❤❤❤
Amo!
Miley
#Doctor😂
❤❤ miley ❤❤ the fénix

Bellissima e bravissima peccato solo per quei tatuaggi così senza senso😢
Miley is the queen
Where is pharrell why isn’t he the main person singing?
This is the type of dancing I like to do while doing chores as I listen to Miley.

Diosa total 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
Espectacular 🥰👏👏👏👏
loveeeee it
Ma solo a me sembra uguale alla canzone dei Maneskin I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE ???
You are amazing Miley If you love Miley like my comment ❤❤
Miley Cyrus + Beyoncé Knowles vibe = MILONCÉ
La Bella Preciosa, Maravillosa, Diosa. Miley Cyrus 💞 Miley Cyrus hasn't won more Grammys? She deserves more. Beyoncé has won 32 Grammys. Beyoncé and J-Z are not that special.
Never been a fan of hers, but I gotta admit she won me over with this album
Çok çok çok iyi inşallah birinci Olursunuz olmasınızda çok iyi

Liam. Typical guy. Couldn’t handle ,  her confidence, her charisma  & pure shine.
If I was on the fence I’d fall off 😆shame you have no interest in touring.I hoped to see you live one day in the uk 🇬🇧 I can understand your reasoning,just do you & enjoy what makes you happy in life wish you all the best keep being a legend 💪🏻
It's giving Tina Turner and I'm here for it!
Phenomenal ❤
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOb9Xaug35M Plagiat
Puro suco. 😎
That hair is making a comeback and it’s giving some 80s Dynasty vibes!
she's so gorgeous
Miley nunca decepciona y junto Pharrell Williams no podría jamás decepcionar!
The way Miley is singing at the beginning sounds exactly like the song I wanna be your slave by Måneskin.  Hopefully they get writing credit.
Dont come at me but I used to be a hater..was not a fan at all.....but I saw the light and the error of my ways....I think Miley is brilliant , stunning....extremely talented. I love her!
i love the dance moves and the whole vibe, so old Hollywood- very Ann-Margret
Miley is so bloody gorgeous!❤
Like Hannah Montana this ? Yes like ❤❤❤
Inspired by Maneskin - Slave, huh? 😏
Reminds me of her grammy appearance.  Cringe and cheap
I love youuu
I love it . But also reminds me of  Maneakin i wanna be your slave
Molto più bella con i capelli scuri e vestita in modo femminile
I see on Top ❤
Going almost 12 years of blonde hair now she has brown hair again since 2011
This look reminds me of Jane Fonda : stunning woman.
え、このダサい歌は何...
This deserves lots of likes😎 but the background going Black to the Pink its so good
❤❤❤❤🎉
❤❤❤
I will always love Miley Cyrus.  Everything I have done over the last 14 years, including every single piece of content on my channel, is because of her. She is the reason why I even have a channel in the first place.
Best
Love the song but the clip is boring
Ok so im no big fan but damn this track is awesome. She looks amazing the sound is next level. I love it! 🔥🔥
ON FIRE GORGEOUS NICE ONE 👌 😍
Why are you still here? Weren't you supposed to move out of the country after Trump got elected years ago?
Her preformaceof Say hello tho heaven for CC showed me much respect for Hannah Montana. I hope her career excels
Sounds like she stole the beat from Moneskin's song "I Wanna Be Your Slave."
This is 1000% a ripoff of slave by maneskin
Hannah Montana grew up
Never have I felt so unaffected by her music...damn she fell off
Also has anyone noticed this was her exact grammy look.... Did she film this before the grammys? 😅 Legend
Why is she so damn beautiful. Urghhh! Love her
I wanna see Trixie Mattel perform this song with Katya
I saw the meme on instagram and litetally typed Miley Cyrus dentist commercial to find this vid
I agree @Daniel Alward x
Comments are so sycophantic & lame
She looks like a Coug somehow. Stop changing ur face!
People can watch endlessly water flow, fire burn, and Miley Cyrus dance❤
Мне очень нравится что сама Майли так кайфует в этом видео ))) Она выглядит счастливой! 😘
Whatever happened to a simple microphone, a stool and a stage? Asking for a friend.lol.
Ok doc
❤️
❤❤❤❤ love this...❤❤❤❤
why is this song so underrated and viewed
Love you!❤❤❤
This is Maneskin I Wanna Be Your Slave with different lyrics and a lame chorus. Just lamer in general.
Super❤❤❤
🤎
Serving
Its April 2024, let's see how many legends are listening to this incredible song💁‍♂
Copy  of maneskin booooooo flop

What the ? So ?  Fuc? Happened
Sounds like mannequin
Ich hab miley damals schon geliebt und ich bin so ein fan❤sie hat eine tolle Ausstrahlung und hat eine geile Stimme
Pharrell doesnt change tone...always the same undertone😅
Ca me rappelle une chanson de Claude François :  " Alexandrie Alexandra"
🥰
I think Miley is just being herself so don't hate her ok 😡😡😡😡 she's just having fun so don't have a cow 😡😡😡
Well, she's beautiful... but she dances like an epileptic chicken...
Cheeseburger
I love it
I can't even get on a fence! My stomach is growling and something else is in me!
Thanks!
🫰
Miley The Besth Queen ♥ The new Madonna :D
what happened to her ? who is this glam lady ? alternative type of miley was fun
ne kadar cahilsiniz burda chp nin başarısı yok sadece seçmen akp ye kırgın oldugu için oyunu chp verdi ve bazı yerlerde de adaylar yanlıştı,chp nin ne başarısı vardı da oyunu verdi kendileri bile bekliyormuydu acaba.
Why is Miley tryna copy the legendary Tina Turner now?
На це постійно хочеться дивитись❤
Work it work it Molly work it out❤🔥👑🥰🎶🎼🎨🥇🎧

Utterly amazing vocal talent,  Miley has it all
The smile..🤩 Show me charisma, she's hypnotic.
Did anybody think she was going to sing Maneskin I wanna be your slave? ...sounded the same
¿En qué momento suena Pharrell? ¿Acaso pasó de rapero a DJ?
She will always look like a horse to me 🐴
Maybe this VIDEO "I LUV It" premiered on March 27th, 2024.
She is very pretty and talented I love her  ❤
Love that muscle man she’s wearing! I remember the 20 minute workout girls wearing this body suit! Loved it then … love it now! 😊
Old miles Cyrus is finally back thank god I missed this Miley back when she released fly on the wall and party in the USA and the climb
You say you are moving if Trump becomes president! I would like to say goodbye and we won't miss you!
Without this body, qhe wouldbt be there.
I’m obsessed ❤
Thrud from, Gow Ragnarok
Für mich ist Sie unsterblich in meinem Herzen verankert, Sie ist eine absolute Mega-Ikone, ich glaube fest, Sie ist über die Zeit hinweg nur noch mehr zu sich Selbst geworden, eine Power-Frau, wie keine Zweite, die keine Bestätigungen nötig hat, Sie ist unschlagbar, und wunderschön so wie Sie ist, Perfektion ist was für Illusionisten, dass braucht Sie nicht, diese Ikone steht für sich alleine!!!  😘😍🥰✨️✨️✨️ ♥️💐🌹🌷🌺🌸🏵🌻🌼💮🍁
I miss her pixie cut era very badly.
Reminds me of 80s pop videos❤❤
Bubba tundie go put her ass to sleep oh wait that's ur career
Is she still here? I thought she said she was leaving USA.
Ela está decididamente incorporando Tina Turner!
Hi 🪽🪽🪽🪽🪽🪽🔺
Que es un homenaje a ls Gran Tina?
Love u
Is this beat from some other song because it sounds familar to me? What did she sample from because i can clearly tell this beat aint hers? 😅 Also wth is that hairstyle of hers? Her hair looks hilariously utterly ridiculously bad and really poofy. Is miley trying to be like Snooky or something? Her hair looks atrocious like the outfit is pretty but the hair has got to go. 😬😂😂

Stolen melody! Mõneskin!!!

Miley is quietly becoming the new Queen. Most would disagree… but many like me see it.
She’s more beautiful and brilliant than ever, the best time and I’m so happy for her ❤
Isnt this song funky town????
👏👏👏 Te ves increible!! 💐
Miley > TS
no me disgusta, perooo no es mi fav.
Doña Florinda is dancing
I love the song and the hair and the outfit but what is up with that dance????
Bringing the Tina Turner energy!
Tina Turner reject
wow
Que canción más fea
ayyyy
🥰🥰🥰😘
CADÊ O PHARREll? A participação dele seria como Produtor, compositor, algum efeito, um Backing vocal inaudível?
She done did it agai n absolutly beutiful and stunning
Lol why she dressed like Tina Turner. I kinda like it though haha
Stupid song
Me after hearing 2 most wanted. 😅😅😅
Kudos to the body, she's in phenomenal shape. But somehow she looks unhinged ... like we might get Jeffrey Dahmered anytime now.
The best maneskin song!!
The main lyric is good but seems like the rest of the beat is lacking
very strange choice of video genre and song for her,... ..but it suits her very well, good job❤
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Where is Pharrell???
I love Destiney
the voice 🎉
Miley is a DREAM💖✨
It is a copy of maneskin I can be a slave. Nothing OG😂
She looks like Tutankhamun who just woke up today
Huhhhh
❤❤❤❤❤🎉
Your Doing good,just open your political view and understand whats really happening.there fooling you and many others.dont believe the lies..the media is very strong.and very controlling.
Miley Cyrus is INCREDIBLE
🇮🇷🌹🇮🇷
She's gorgeous ❤
You seriously devoured
This is really terrible 🤦
Linda maravilhosa
Ate Miley Ate
Miley te amo
Miley te amo
Mick Jagger! That's the vibe she has - in the best way possible. That sort of natural sleaze and energy
Amazing 💎 Obsessed with it 💫
0:37 no me hearing/singing "thank you Suga"
I love how Miley is channeling her inner Tina Turner and Beyonce hear ❤
https://youtu.be/v3hSE3Pu2a8
Wow 😂❤❤I live it the legend so talented❤❤❤❤🎉
This is March 2025 & MILEY CYRUS  with PHARRELL in DOCTOR is exceedingly exuberant, ecstatic, expressive, exquisitely entertaining and excellently enjoyable. The singing is singularly sparkling, spellbinding, superb, soulful, sweet and simply spectacular. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
gross
Tina Turner inspired look and moves. Nonetheless, Miley is doing it great and adds a lot of her own. Great legs and eyes by all means. Anyway, Tina's look and moves might have been deeply influenced by taste and vision of Ike Turner. This video and song are so sugary, sexy, simple and spontaneous. I dig it.
"Get it Mama" I know that's rite!
Iconic
Boring
why this videos doesn´t stop playing?
She looks just like Tina Turner. It's like the current version. Will it be like a tribute? Either way, it's a talent.
this is very catchy, I like it!
This is fantastic, major future classic vibes.
Hey my service Miley Cyrus du hast auch gutes Lied mal 2024 mach weiter ich liebe deine Lieder bitte nach Deutschland und Spiele wieder mal in Deutschland egal wo sobald es in Hamburg oder in Dillingen finnruf von Balu Ciao mal das alles schau mal die Charles Smiley Cyrus Smiley Cyrus Smiley Charles Smiley Smiley Smiley Cyrus Smiley Cyrus Miley Cyrus Smiley
lenda
I am in awe of how stunning your presence has become from your beginings as H.M.... You are so much more than that..and you prove you are more and more than anymore ever saw coming every single day. I love you so much  Miley.... <3
This is so f'en joyous, funky, fun, and flirty. Miley is having the time of her life and I am here for it!
MANESKIN 🤔....
wheres pharrel williams
The opening chorus sounds a LOT like "I wanna be your slave" by maneskin   No shade, I'm a fan just pointing it out.
This is Hannah Montana grown up.  ...I hope it is okay to say that cuz damn. The producers said way back then that Miley WAS Hannah. Yes. She is and here she is. 😍
W Miley
White girl dancing at its best lol love it!
Thanx Miley for Loving me! i will love you, too! the german god
This dance is weird but the song is not bad.😃😃😃
Who else were waiting for Pharrell to have a verse?
the rythm at the first seconds remember me from a song but idk which one...
Let’s be honest, the song is crap.
Miley ❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤🌌🙏
Solid
Maneskin? 😳
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Miley has solidified herself as an icon of this generation this year. She will be written down with the other greats.
Estou triste pelo fato da Indústria só ter atribuído um Grammy a Miley esse ano pela música "Flowers" depois de 18 anos de trabalho árduo, mas tbm estou feliz por ela, pela persistência dela em cantar e entregar música Country boa
My gosh!!i love her❤
No sé cómo interpretar la letra de esta canción. No és por criticarla, pero teniendo en cuenta que uno de los grandes problemas del patriarcado es que a relegado a la mujer únicamente a los cuidados de los demás, ya sean hijos, padres, etc.y del hogar, és decir, ámbito de lo privado, sin reconocimiento alguno ni salario, y sacarla de casi toda escena pública relevante (oficios,política, sociedad...)y tengo dudas con eso de déjamelo curarte....lo hace por criticar?
Beyond Thunder Dome! I love it.. please make a new version
Miley is ❤ .but the song is too simply .she can do better songs
She looks great and fun song but the editing is so bad
Great disco vibes
Looks like Anahi from RBD
What happened to Miley Cyrus, im not complaining but too much has changed
Найкраща❤
I think you’re drunk smiley Cyrus from getting your first Grammy
Such a weird video. Just like the Beyonce texas holdem song. Its not what i expected. I like the song but when i heard it i seen like a 70s disco or an old 80s work out theme with leg warmers and a body suit. Idk the video threw me
Divaaa❤❤
Miley you go girl
What an absolutely stunning body!
Are we going to talk about how stunning she is now? Man she's gorgeous❤
Disappointing. This is bang average
Very Young Jane Fonda
1:13 I just got a Bangerz’s vibe 😯❤️
Those moves at the beginning of the video are gonna be iconic!
One fine creature and can sing like hell!❤❤❤
I like this Miley more and more, don't stop baby
Does anyone think that this song is kinda copie...😅Måneskin- I wanna be your slave
I think Taylor is a better songwriter, but Miley is obviously the better singer 😬
QUEEN
❤❤❤❤❤
iT s Just me or someone is with me that this song the opening is similar to a song from Maneskin????
This song is awesome and I can't stop watching ❤❤🥰🥰😍😍😘😘
La nueva tina Turner
They couldn’t afford a real set cause of the hair product budget lol
Super Bowl 2029
El símbolo  Pide y se te dará  🏟️🏈🌎

Who listened yesterday?
Miley give it a rest you had your day go and enjoy your millions with you jail tattoos. this song is disgusting

Your voice is beautiful, and you are beautiful! I hope you're happy and stay healthy, and stay you! No need for all those unnessecary plastic surgery!
Vestita da infermiera sarebbe stato un bel video. Anzi perfetto 😂❤
Like si eres Latino y escuchas esté hip
Anahí do RBD?😱
tá a cara da Anahí 😀
I love how she makes it work with different styles of music and attitude and always do it right. I really love her as an artist. And btw, I love feeling her this free and happy. I love it. Congratulations Miley! You are simply the best 🥇

Coked-out.
Miley ❤❤
She reminds me so much of 90's Thalia. The hair and the dress screams Thalia.
Yes where is Pharrell
She looks like a old lady 😂😂
The best song I have heard in a very long time. I would love to see her play if she ever comes out to Australia. I'd love her to sing one of my songs. Perhaps a slow version of my song Love Me At All.  Thankyou.  https://youtu.be/83_jW7ZwzPU?si=noX4EvORGij8CNqf  Or any of my songs  https://youtube.com/channel/UCImws7g7yvr0yKb_m5mPkhg?si=buYcut_AQ7BjI4ub  I would love to be her support act.
cipka pitka
Skill
Se parece demaciado a ANAHI EN ESTEEE VIDEO😲😲
I like that too 🙂
All the stuff thats coming out i wonder if that's why she like this? Was she abused too?
stop with this hair 🫣🤦‍♀️
You're the Best! Always!!!!! 😍❤️‍🔥💃🏻
She is giving me Vanessa Williams vibes (her look, not vocals)!
this song is a BOP, deserves better!!
She’s such a sex symbol, any man who doesn’t wanna just tear this up is beta
She’s to be protected
This song is everything
She needs to floss more often. Those gums are inflamed!
Miley is so beautiful!!!❤❤❤
A melhor de2024
Guapaaaa
She's so pretty she needs to branch out into modeling as well .
Espetacular ❤️🇧🇷❤️
❤️
This song really works if u put it on loop and sleep
https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=SrTTYPE64RiBB5qf
We need to bring back the dislike button so people can go back to having their opinions, and my opinion is Miley sucks and that Vanessa Carlton is better, fuck Miley Cyrus and her entire fanbase
Miley sucks
Miley gives off the Tina Turner dances. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love her so much. I like every single song she’s releasing since 2020. I’m so happy to be her fan bc ik i’m going to enjoy her new music❤❤❤
❤🇧🇷
YAaaasssssss chil' 🥳🥳🥳🫶🫶🫶🫶 loving this! Can feel your liberation gurl💜💜💜💜💜 and I'm all for it! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 #onrepeat 👏👏👏

Who tf told her this look and DANCE was it???
I thought it was like britneys stage scene in a prior song
Banger
I bet she's yummy!
Maneskin copycat
Very INXS sounding to me.
Me suena a work de Beyonce the Austin powers
Красивая, фигура отпад, но эти мелкие татушки по всему телу смотрятся издалека как грязь.

Шикарная девочка! Ей очень  к лицу этот стиль. И она такая же необузданная как Тина Тернер

Sounds like Måneskin - I Wana Be Your Slave 😮😮😮😮 And rhat sad little doggie paddle is an insult , drowning in these moves and huni, why did you do that to your teeth? Looks like she has dentures on. I like Miley Cyrus, but l dont like when rich folks think they can when they shouldn't
I don’t know, the dancing is a bit odd at the beginning 😂 but yeah I like her confidence
She is absolutely HAVING FUN with this song❤❤❤
Um I watched this because it said Pharrell Williams
BABE U GIVING OUT MILF VIBES AND I LOVE IT!!!!!
Who's listening today?
A Miley é tão incrível. Ela nunca aparece com algo previsível. É sempre uma surpresa. É sempre algo bom. Nunca decepciona ❤ é uma Lady... Essa mulher REALMENTE AMA O QUE FAZ. Entrega qualidade, arte conceito, beleza e finesse...
Love this hair on Miley. <3
I love this little weird vibe thing she got going on ❤
Looking a little Jane Fondaesq. Beautiful
She looks like Viola from Monster-In-Law. I love it! haha
Funny song😂😂😂  i like it

2014: Pharrell+Miley = Come get it bae 🔥 2024: Miley+Pharrell = Doctor 🔥🔥🔥
Me encanta Miley!!! ❤🇵🇪✨
Plagiarism from Maneskin's song!
She's LITERALLY Billy Rays Daughter and Dolly Partons God daughter for sure.
Swerve.
She is becoming a Queen! wow have come a long way...way to go Miley!
I think has to be one of her worst songs it’s so cringe
She looks absolutely STUNNING!
I don't usually listen to Miley Cyrus but I like this one.....
I love Miley, however I always have a feeling, that she copies with every album others.
Too many Miley haters on here.
why does it sound like beggin from maneskin?
Very bad lip synching to make the video. Very bad.
Chi la sta sentendo ora???
Ma Pharrell Williams?😅
F the haters. I LOVE her look!
Forget Taylor need more Miley !=8)
Is Just me or she kinda look like a younger version of Jane Fonda ? 😂
2026?
She is so amazing!!! To come above from those turbulent years is Fantastic!!!  So full of life, sincerity and being herself is great to see what a fighter she is!   So PROUD of her!
U RUINED POP
Lobe
Whatever state she’s in, is a healthy one cause miss Miley is VIBRANT and FIT in this video
The rhythm, the lyrics, everything in this is shit🤮
Elle peut quasi tout chanter mais je la préfère largement dans un registre plus country/rock.
Sorry but no for the video
Tell me what is your Toothpaste's name?  plz
She's still beautiful than ever
The only thing that's ever bothered me is when she got her fake teeth. Her teeth just don't look like her.
And welcome to Flowers part 3!!!!
I could be your doctor, take you to your limit… we could be intimate, I can you apart.
Hermosa la miley te amo ❤❤❤❤

Dancing with the Stars?? 😁

We are waiting for "Nightmare" - Miley Cyrus 🎉
Gloria Trevi ?

Have you paid Mâneskin for the song or have you stolen IT?
one word for mileys era, Groovy <3
I like her hair color and style. Real lady.
Hair...😂
Who else was waiting for Pharrell to join her singing? Loooooool
Alls I gotta say is YASSS QUEEN!!! You look Amazing Miley and I love the song.
Shes like a mix between Faith Hill, Shania Twain, Dolly and some 80's vibe. Loving it.

Sounds very Pharrell
Maneskin- i wanna be your slave
https://www.youtube.com/@MCGIChannel
I don’t like this new Miley. She’s gone down the same path as so many young female artists. Oversexualizes herself for fame rather than using her amazing talent. Creates increasingly mediocre music(flowers being an exception).  She’s now rough,  crass, and not appealing like she was. Terrible role model for young females.
❤❤❤❤❤
😢
Ugh…she’s SO cringe!
Franchement je vois pas l intérêt d un clip axé sur sa propre personne . Le clip n’a aucun sens . Narcissisme bonjour.
I want you to. ❤
Miley just gets better and better she's envolved so much with her music.
All the things people will do for money xD
Wow! She wears sobriety well!
Bellissimo lavoro.. Tanto anni 80. Geniale!
Like Tina Turner. The same energy 🔥🔥🔥
Have a very good beat.i ❤Miley😅
Neat song😊🎤🎸🥁Has a good 🪘😊❤🏵️😇💐🐨🐼😻😸🎞️🎬
Maneskin- I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE
Hey Miley love to see you stole Kylie Minogues dress and hair style from the 90s!  Can't come up with something original these days??
The most fake teeth in the game
Crap song with the same old pharrel sound. She's so annoying in this video. Can't dance and what's with the tongue constantly out
She used to be kind of attractive right?
Last you hear of her this was bad and she not aging well
Her body in 2024 is 🔥 🔥 🔥
A mi me gusta ella pero este vídeo no me gusta mucho
Miley looks so much like her mom !!!!
Trash 🗑️
I was playing this at 1.25 speed accidentally and it sounds FIRE. Love it
i should do a cover of this song on my youtube channel because i LOVE IT!!!!
Hey there sexy lady :-)
Just 13 m , so song flopped 😂
Am I the only one who’s getting feelings like they mixed Jane Fonda and Ru Paul’s looks to create this?  I love it ❤
Perfect
thank you mother
I like that song by miley cyrus and pharrell Williams
Hinder - striptease
Would love to see her on The Voice panel!
Amazing prtcussion, background track and guitar break....
Fabulous!
Thus song🎉🎉🎉
she's pretty ; she's iconic ; and can't possibly be beat
Yeh nah... that's 3 mins I can't get back.  Give me 70's/80's/90's any day.
This song is horrendeous
Miley is giving all the Tina. God I miss the Queen of Rock n' Roll!
Tina turner.....
lady gaga best 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
She kills it 😻
Maneskin  song ?
I wish I had her energy and confidence. If they sold it in a bottle i'd buy it.
It's a mix between the 'Blurred Lines' song and an outfit like Tina Turner's, right?
Omg this is so ass
love this
Tal vez me equivoque pero parece que quiere recrear auna de la s grandes con ese vestido volumen de cabello al gran Tina Tornet
🤢 ugly song 🤢
Total ripoff of Maneskin!
iiii love iit
Glaf
It started off sounding like I wanna be your slave but Maneskin
I love this song❤❤❤❤🎉 please make another one
J’adore  ! Le son , sa personnalité, sa fraîcheur et elle s’amuse ❤
When i am reincarnated i am demanding to come back as miley!! 🙏🤣💕
WOW, Welcome back  old Mily
I’ve never hated hairspray before
And no one ever learns not to collab or not make pharrel as producer
Eu tava esperando muito mais depois do grande sucesso de flowers mais gostei 👍
Why do I always just have Flowers stuck in my head 24/7
The best songs 0f 2024
Hey Milley,  you’re knocking it out of the park on every song you do and every song style.   Love the big hair, you’re bringing it back! It’s You! 😂 Something you might think about is a song for a lost loved one.  I’m a widow, it’s just part of life, it happens and we are never prepared for it.  But not too many music artists have accomplished the songs of lost love ones for funerals and regrets of things we should have fixed while they were still here.  It’s certainly an extremely difficult song task to take on.  But, it’s a song that never gets old, and people need them to help express sorrow, amazing fun, a wealth of blessings that captures time.  It would also bring back amazing memories, every-time it plays.  For those of us, that have had to plan a celebration of life, it’s a tough road of choices all around. Let alone the hard choices of picking songs..  It would help so many people, if there were more songs related to the celebration of life, that includes thankfulness, blessings of memories and so much more.   Such heart felt songs help us realize how important people were and helps to express our feeling in time of grief.    Sorry to ask for that,  but the older I get, I see it’s an area that could help a lot of people.  You may never see this message, but hopefully some song writer will.  Sending prayers out to this request to find the right listener to write a heart felt song that could help so many, in times of need.
This is so bad…
Ma solo a me questa canzone fa pensare ai maneskin?
I just gotta get up dance every time this song comes on!
❤wouw amazing ❤
Aha 🥼🩺https://youtu.be/4Fc67yQsPqQ📃✍See U  are doing better !
Yassssss Miley
This seems like a parody of a pop song lmao not an actual song
Hanna Montana is getting hotter and hotter. Better and better. Greater and greater. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lmaoo no one is here anymore 😭 why did this song totally tank?!
Why do artists no longer sing with the same passion as before like Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson or John Lennon?
pharrell production is 🔥
Hi
What is this dress??? 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Miley is pure perfection!
You almost show like Cher.
Girl is slayinnn.... ....😜💋🌹👠❤️‍🔥!
omg she's transforming into Blanche Devereaux 😂😂😂😂😂😂 she's horny and southern 💖💖💖💖💖💖 I love this song
Good song
I wondered how this sounds so familiar. Then it hit me. Moneskin: Zitti E Bueni 2021 eorovision winner
Regresamos al 2012?
Not Pharrell’s best work. Needed some Chad.
Eugene Oregon nguy
❤❤😊😊
She looks so much older with this 80's make up and hairdo and furs. Love her beauty, but why she is trying to look like an 40y.o. diva?
Se quiso hacer la Shakira??? 😂 Hay pasos medios copiados
she sounds great looks great, miley couldnt be any better
I feel better about how I used to dance in nightclubs now
Yeah I’m obsessed
Still my fave 16 yrs later❤.
i love you this song , because is perfect
Tiene un parecido con Anahí de RBD. Great song!
Where is Pharrell😢😅
I see some Cher glam in this one.  Lovin the look. 🔥 🎉
Confused
I'm glad shes made this video. I want to be Jewish even more . They still can't cut hair very well lololol or sing or act. Epitome of superficiality.
Always distrust politicians, Always distrust the mainstream media.  Sempre desconfie dos políticos. Sempre desconfie da grande mídia.
She looks GENUINELY happy. So glad for her.
her dance is cute and sexy. i love miley cyrus
The way 31yo Miley is channeling 86yo Jane Fonda, I'd say there's definitely some issues she needs to "work it out".
Yeah no 👎🏻
te amo mãe
When you're a star ✨... there's no need to do anything else in the video 📷😅🎉
Já quero remix com o pharell cantando 😂
Miley se ve tan linda con ese nuevo look 🫰🤍
I think people forget that releasing music is about versatility, an Artist isn't always gonna bring you number 1 hits, it's about experimenting what fans enjoy and not everything is a competition. This was fun for her and you can see the smile on her face. I for one, enjoy the song and her enthusiasm. That's what makes an Artist real. So she got a YES from me. Give her the recognition she deserves, she's been in the business long enough and she got more money than i have and she got my respect ❤❤
Somebody watching??😊😊😊
There is nothing to work out! This world is finished and I promise you that!!!!
Lyrics I could be your doctor And I could be your nurse I think I see the problem It's only gon' get worse A midnight medication Just show me where it hurts I need to rock you, baby Before your body bursts Let me work it out (oh) Let me work it out, oh yeah Let lil' mama work you out (huh, ah) You wanna work it out?

She has so much presence in this video, I love it! This makes me want to see her acting again, you can just tell how talented she is! Her being so playful and carefree in this video… seems like this is actually the best way to spite all the haters😂 the camera loves her!
she is iconic
Best song this year so far
i love u MC
she is so good it hurts
she is soooo talented
what a voice oh my god... goosebumps
work that updo
Muy buena la canción pero el baile pailas
miley is the queen frfr
that dress is so fantastic
such great video and song
what an incredible voice
go miley go
she's the real deal
Prettiest in the world right now!
coming back to this everyday is the best thing.
Love the song, but Miley’s hair makes her look so much older than she is! 😮 she’s only 31 but the hair makes her look 41 just saying not hating I love Miley. Another thing is that is seems they are gonna be cheap now with music videos. The production for this is just her, where is Pharrell Williams? where is the back of dancers?👯 and where is like more locations than just the backdrop?  It just feels like like since music videos are kind of dying out a little bit and not getting the viewership it used to that they are gonna start producing real Cheap videos.
just a perfect video seriously i love love love it !!!!
This  song  sucks
Реклама личного стоматолога Майли доктора Горовица
mia colucci tá diferente 🤡
I always love Miley glowing with beauty ✨️ 😍 ❤💯🙏🙌👏
is this a start for her new era ?
She doesn't need a spotlight to shine. She's the spotlight!
She looks like she’s having so much fun in this video! Just being her true self! I’m so glad she’s back!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
LETS DO 15M
Lovin' it❤

La canzone è carina ma somiglia molto a quella dei Maneskin, che ovviamente è migliore di questa.
Teeth
Good for an advertisement, she´s quite better than this

This song is in my head rignt now ONG definitely a favourite song of mine love this song.❤

RAWR!!!!!!! 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Miley cyrus is the new Madonna ?? 👀👀
Great beat, catchy melody, moves, sass. Love this song and video—perfect to dance to. I know that it was originally recorded for “Bangerz” more than a decade ago, but this version perfectly fits her voice now.
It makes me sad that so many Gen Zers are missing the obvious Tina Turner homage... her dress, her moves, her hair, even her damn arm muscles working lol... go watch Tina Turner live kids
Catchy
Slay
Lol I don't get why she gets hate Hannah is mad pretty 😊😈❤❤
Those fake teeth look nice
This is pure cringe
flop of the year 💀☠
Iconic
Great song - Miley looks like a young Dannii Minogue.
Its about time that pharrell & Timbaland produce more again !!!
2024/3/20 .. 3:49am
I've got a song or two.  No money for me. Directly cash I can hand out to homeless vets. Follow me, if you think I'm not on the up and up.  Financially I'm good.
Miley if i was into women you'd be loved but gurl you hot anyway every day! love it all!
Simplemente..... Fantástica!!!!
Isso aí não está bom não amiga 😮
Lol
Miley cyrus Is Working It Out? Girl Is Doing Her Thing She's Changed Her Whole Look & I'm Here For Her New Look Also I  am  Feeling This New Song\ Doctor Let Me Work It Out?
Sorry, but body (child Daddy doughter) and image (clone Tina Turner). But technics good made Pharrell Williams. Next made in Jamiroquai... .
Y Pharrell Wlliams? no apareció en el vídeo, para que lo nombran ni si quiera aparece. Poco empatia se llama eso. El tema muy lindo, lo que no me gusto, que no apareció él.
Copied maneskin I wana be your slave song smh
Yeah
Please, someone, make an empty arena or stadium version.
Darling ..Lent one thing but work it out ..happy. ?
Let me say Miley Cyrus. I love you and all your songs. The climb. Jolene. Love you. Get married?
The devil is working hard
Earthquake,I like it.
👏🌹💖🌹
Sindel from Mortal Kombat 😍😍😍
Ella se ve tan hermosas más que eso es como Los Ángeles de victoria deben verse lo que deben ser y su baile es hipnótico
Saçlar çok yakışmış
It's copy of maneskin song
I feel some Måneskin vibes. ❤
Gives me 80s  love it ❤❤
WHY is Pharrell listed as one of the singers? Miley should be listed as the sole singer. I know he produced it and co-wrote it, but he is NOT the singer. I dont get it! They always list the singer of the video, don't they? First time I have seen something like this so I am puzzled.
Anybody else getting Tina Turner vibes watching this. She looks amazing ❤
She’s so iconic. Super Bowl 2025?? Please!
Her hairstyle is hilarious!!! She’s bringing back the 80s or what?  She’s so fit!!!
She looks stunning 😍 💖
#1 WorkOut song right now… 🏋️‍♂️
Miley so awesome. So underrated. Taylor who???
Hey everyone, I just uploaded a cover of John Lennon's <<Imagine>> ♥️ It'd mean the world to me if any of you would take a minute to check it out!! 🎶
Miley Cyrus have some Celine Dion 90s/2000s Looks
This has to be the most worst embarrassing song of all time wdf
bad song bad dancing sorry Hanna
Hey this baby 🐥, you know we're I live,.
Blleeeeeah... Miley too much Manekin . Is the same style.
👑 Miley Cyrus👑 is 💯 percent ‼️👑 👑 👑
Miley Cyrus deserves more Grammys, than Beyonce's, "Thirty-Six" GRAMMYS!!!!
Miley Cyrus, is the real Queen. And definitely not Beyoncé. Go Miley Cyrus 💞🌹💞!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
a unique artist, beautiful woman, and resplendent
For all the people saying she copied the song of Maneskin, relax. Miley's song was made in 2012 and published only now. :)
Perfect lady beautiful talent and inspiration
Que vídeo inútil 🥴😂
This song is pretty effing catchy. And am i hearing a little sample beat from Blurred Lines? 😮👍🏾🔥
So this Miley:Disco Era 🤔😎. She kinda looks like Jane Fonda
Outstandingly HOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Go queen
Is it me or “she” has an adam apple?
🫠🔥
Dear Miley Cyrus, in person would be nice. I need some love.
Essa musica e totalmente de +🎉❤😂😂😂😊😊
All I see in teeth xD
Miley , please bean my doctor
Let me first say, it's refreshing to see an Artist with the stage presence, energy, charisma and courage to not need back ground singers or dancers and the common sense to save her money by shooting a scaled down shoot.
my diamond, i love u miley
Iconic
I'm convinced that Kylie Minogue would like this song, and especially this video. Great Miley!!!
Un ballo davvero particolare più lo guardo e l'ascolto. Mi piace sempre di più.
Espectacular
she is perfect
I feel like rinsing my ears. What rubbish
❤❤❤❤
This is a bop

Wow They really ripped this Song from Maneskin - I wanna be your Slave.  😢 Not cool.
I'll be honest, given the lyrics for this, I'm really disappointed with this video!! ❤
Love this video music 🎶
Unbeatable
you were the same as now, stop once and for all to death threaten me!
I do not like it.
❤❤❤❤❤ l love you
You know i was suprised at her response to her father! I nean for a girl who has done and said all the crap she has you would think she would be the last fckn person to judge anyone
New music: https://youtu.be/a-RJfFjkkaU?si=J9Cb8MyTTL7dBBb0
This video is giving "mabee she's born with it" but in the best way
❤ hi miley .
I want to be your slave, I want to be your master I wanna make your heart beat round like rollercoaster

This video is purely to show how hot she is
HAWTTTTT❤ QUEEN

Gives me nostalgia of "Can't be tamed". Miley slay it sis 💃🏽
Look at her and her father, from  one hot wonder to billionaires! Too cool!
Still ENJOYING ❤😊🎉🎉🎉🎉 😃
Iam the only one who thinks she doesn't use her voice to the max
she stole the music from Eurovision Italians Winners...song is good, but she should the coloboration with them it would sound better, because this duo woukd rock... think about that
Lit
Maneskin
And Pharrell? 😢

Gosh, she is so scary locking 😮
Nice cover of I wanna be your slave by Maneskin 😂
Loved it, wish we could have had a cameo of Pharrell,!
Miley Is very very iconic
😮😍
Director - How much Miley do you want? Miley - Yes!
I'm just waiting for the remake of Beyond the Thunderdome to come out
جذااااااب 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You can’t deny: She looks fantastic ❤ And I love the song
Danas pere Doktor
Na minha opinião a Miley está em sua melhor fase até hoje.
Who else was expecting Pharrell to drop a verse? 🙋🏻‍♂
🦆 abwatschen? Wash 🧽

The beat is too similar to Måneskins to be a coincidence

There's something about Beetlejuice in her dance. 😂
Kadın sana aşık oldum ben sanırım 😍
Sounds like maneskin tbh
Hey, Miley! Stop getting plastic surgery, you look like your mom, you look like Madonna, you don't look like Miley Cyrus anymore. You're killing your personality. Get your cute cheeks back! Don't do this anymore.  They're stealing your face.
😊
Thalia? 😅😅😅😂
I thought this was Vanessa Williams at first lol
Love it...  Made me want to work it out.
Miley is truly the best she makes me happy when depressed ❤ I love her and everything about her
Im glad that she turned her hair back brown❤
“I could be your doctor….” part is very very similar to “i wanna be your slave” song by maneskin
❤❤❤❤
Meth not even once
Wack
I bet her dentist had a lot of referrals after this video.
another Grammy for Miley
iconic✨✨
She looks so much like her mom in this video

She is so beautiful since she put herself back together. And her music has gotten a lot better
SEEING HER PANTIES, DID IT FOR ME... ❤❤❤❤❤
I loved ❤, My song this March!!!
m tum tum...   Millennials be like :    * I remember , I remember when I lost my mind.
She was always a great singer but her voice has gotten a deeper, rawer timber over the years, if you compare this with "Wrecking Ball". Don't know if it's cigarettes, lifestyle or just age, but it suits her well.

Miss Malibu just gets better all the time.
Pero en el vídeo no sale Pharrel Williams. O donde está él??
She looks so much like her mom here
HA
Divina!!! Beautiful Miley!!
Love it
I see  Jane Fonda big time for us old school Boyz!
She is so much more beautiful with that gorgeous hair!!
Her dentist must be very proud of her.
Big hair, big teeth, big ass. Very poppish.  Where's Miley?
she's 💯 Trish now 😂those genes are strong ❤
I’m getting some Tina Turner vibes with her hair and her dress and I love it 😍
Legendary, Classy!
AMAZING....50 times or more...
I'm Very Sorry for What Happened to you....    Love You Miley
I love this video. Miley was giving such a vibe
Esperando pharraell cantar😢
Absolutely tragic 😢
😂😂😂
Copiatissima dai maneskin nel ritmo iniziale 😮 troppo trucco, perché prendere 30 anni in più con un video? Grande
Love It!!!
Colgate commercial
Seems stolen from maneskin from italy.
I hate this song so much. It’s annoying… 😭😭😭😭 I need Taste of my own to drop
Is this song a clone of Maneskin 's one?
Me desespera este tipo de canciones, porque dicen lo mismo todo el tiempo
She looks so old. It’s cringy
Ngl. Her lips is mesmerizing to watch
Dang, Miley is fine tuned
But the chorus sounds so similar Beyoncé's Work It Out though?! Is it an interpolation?
😀
Funn
Queen
Is Pharrell in the room with us right now? 😭
she make it fresh again
SINCE 2006 with you SMILEY MILEY❤️
The doggy arms 💀 no but this looks like it was choreographed for the girls. Girls just wanna have fun
she dances like Trixie Mattel
😊
💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Miley your beautiful soul your family we may walk and feel alone family not to far away I understand completely ❤️ multidimensional soul ❤️ love your spirit pure Love and the pain we all feel only you will understand your not alone ❤️
I'll work it out with the federal government!! I now know what is happening.
Thanks for the warning Destiny Hope.
In the bangers era, there was only going to be Miley Cyrus.
You said you would leave the country if Trump was elected president.  Eight years later wtf you still doing here?
Confidence
Когда Майли поняла, что ее одной ДОСТАТОЧНО для того, чтобы от клипа нельзя было оторвать глаз))
Love this song
I love this song  ❤
wooooowww!!!
Never disappoints
She's just showing us that we should brush our teeth.😂
Like a drunk Aunty dancing at a wedding
destiny is so beautiful ✨
So beautiful
Why it says pharell williams?
New Miley love u
This reminds me of Eurovision's Maneskin "I want to be your master".
STUNNING VIDEO
Worst song she's done
Is it me or does it sound a little like maneskin?
Miley se descubrió y aprendió a amarse más. Eso parece
Miley is straight up nasty.🤮
Body amazing, face 45 yrs old
LETS GET HER TO SUPERBOWL
Boring
Pharrell Williams never disappoints❤
Does she know she is a legend? Aomwbody tell her please
This makes me smile.
If you ever want to make the most happy women on heart come have a show in Quebec 🙏 Thetford mines Quebec ❤🧚‍♀️ Hôtel du domaine ❤️
She Rocked This.... Thanks Pharrell 😊
This is giving me Shania Twain vibes
Getting Kylie vibes from this.
Ella pronuncia un inglés tipo británico, por qué?
One of the best in the industry
She got to be different. She did effortlessly ❤😂
Miley gets music, more than most pop artists of this generation. She is NOT a one trick pony for sure and in my opinion doesn't get the props she deserves. She is better than Taylor, Selena, Katy, Dua etc honestly!
Te amamos Miley 🥰
Why does this look like a Single Ladies audition tape?
Barbie tina tuner
I love how Miley keeps reinventing herself.
Iconicccc ❤
I honestly love the whole retro look, even her old hair color. Giving sassy dolly meets Tina with old Miley.
Ay Mi vida, estás muy preciosa :3 la  mejor época de Miley actualmente
That fake teath...eww. Why? Why people destroy they own healthy teeth just for...for what actualy? 🤷‍♀️
An amazing video for a song that sounds like a whole lotta nothing 🎉
Ohne Kommentar eine Glanzleistung😍🤩
Miley you are amazing!
❤❤❤❤  🇦🇷
You can just tell that Miley is an incredibly wonderful person with a kind, wise soul. I'm not.even into her style of music, yet I'm a huge fan!
Miley has the most incredible voice! I so wish she would sing the kind of music I'm into. I've heard her do some covers that blew my mind and were leaps and bounds better than the original.  I'd like to hear some Janis Joplin, Lucinda Williams,  Natalie Merchant, Alison Kraus, Sheryl Crow, or Emmylou Harris style music.  Or a Ryan Adams cover. I bet she would sound amazing singing Come Pick me Up. Or some Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt, Graham Parsons, Lumineers, or Wilco style music.  I did love the song Flowers. It wasn't too poppy for me.
Go Girl
lol that sounds like choke me spank me pull my hair from xzibit. very original song congratulations
❤🎉❤miley
Seems like manbeskin   Song  at beginning than .. ttop
So lá da di da di , take sugar ,
does anyone know if you can buy the dress she’s wearing!!?? It’s gorgeous
To be honest its to not see Pherrill Williams in this video at like he used on all the other videos.
That hair.  😢
Looove Mileyyy! The Queen that you are! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love you girl you change the world❤🥰😘🌍🌎🌏🙏
Me encanta exageradamente la potencia y cambio de su voz en la versión del 2024. Combina perfectamente con la imagen glamourosa que está proyectando 😍✨
Its a hit song. Pharrell and Miley what a combination

Power  Woman 😘

Hannah its all grown up.
Well that was overwhelmingly disappointing.... even with Pharrell producing it was dull... and why did I expect to see her doing the conga halfway through?? yuk... no thanks..
Lemme work it out
She is like a young Jane Fonda here. ❤
Iconic
Hi heels and sexy dress is not healing for a broken heart ❤ It's very much like big boss want's a super girl 🎉

Song 🤔
Tina Turner phase???? I love it
Reminds me of Manneskin
Miley lookin famn good in this video
🍎👊🏻🍎☀️☀️👙😁🤤
I love how shes more iconic than anyone in history and now has started to make absolutely iconic music. Her music was always good, sometimes iconic, but all she makes now is top-notch. Wonder if her ex was holding her back
Someone do a mashup between this one and maneskin’s
Its giving vogue. And I love it
The beginning sounds like Maneskin's song i just can't remember which 🤔
Okay I see her doing Tina Turner and she working the legs 🦵 get it Miley
If Trixie Mattel woke up as a cis woman.
She’s an original
I just love to see her having fun and jumping around haha
That voice!
ensuite il y a d'autre et le monde est peut etre bien chez d'autre
Is a DIVA, IS GLORIOUS!!!!!!❤😂🎉
Queen ❤
Come get it bae revamped, I see you 😋🤘
This sounds like *I want to be your slave* by Maneskin
But Pharrell is…where?
The song is actually catchy 🤯
Stupid obscene lyrics. And you guys gonna expose your children to this?
Shes left the gangster lifestyle i see... which culture is she jumping on next?
Ma solo io appena l’ho cominciata a sentire ho pensato ai Maneskin e I wanna be your slave? 🤣
She looks very thin 🙈but in an extremely way
Never been a fan but she's just awesome. (I'm nobody's fan honestly lol I like music in general and listen to what i feel like listening to) her timbre is very peculiar, i like it a lot. Much love to you Miley
GRAMMY WINNER BITCHESSSS!!!! ❤
It’s so good see Miley just having fun ❤
❤❤❤
ТЫ ВКУСНАЯ НО ПЕСНЯ ((((((((Я

The beginning beats sound just like I Wanna be a Slave by Maneskin.
👍👍👍
I love her... All her❤
Such a fun and refreshing video for some reason it makes me want to skip around and have fun
Lemme work it out
Amando está música 😍
Miley is more than a diamond, she's a whole god dam universe ❤
Боже каак ты изменилась постарела
wait why PHARRELL WILLIAMS name is featured though there are no vocals from him.....😅😅😅
노래 진짜 너무 좋다!
She looks like J-lo and Beyonce having a baby together
Que sigan los hits !! Bella y única!! Abrazo desde Argentina!! 💜✨🇦🇷
What a load of shite
I like this, and it strongly reminds me of those tv yoga instructors. The ones with the bright leotards, tights, and sweatbands. And the high ponytail or big teased hair.
Cuando más lo veo, más me encanta
why does she look 40 yo?
She's so fine
Pharrels verse not needed. SLAYYY
0:26 PERFECT 👌
Bro sounds like blurred lines lol no hate to Miley but Pharrell what are you doing
Reminds me of Måneskins "I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE"..
I didn't want this video to end
Preciosa y fuerte mujer! Me encanta que ha sido siempre ella, gran referente de talento y autenticidad sin imitar ni opacar; simplemente fantástica ❤
Fire

She looks so happy <3

I love this song!!  Completely underated.
Miley is so addicting 😍
https://youtu.be/t8H_XmcfUlY?si=MeXAKxS6F1s-CxO4. Is it just me? the bass beat on the background sounded like one of the Filipino ethnic music from Mindanao Philippines. It is called Kalipay. Check the link just to see the see similarity.
When you realized Miley's hairdo and dress fits perfectly as Cheetah for the WW2 movie.
im buff
Iconic againand agaun
This is the most SEXY video of her, there are 3 thing that really make me crazy. The way she dance Her mouth (teeth) And  her raspy voice This turned into wild
So cool
Your the best ❤😊
Er..heloo Måneskin vibes anyone?
Is everyone in this comment section a bot? Or fake multiple accounts? Really absolutely no one disliked this ? Sure . She looks terrible in this . Those dance moves were not helping her . Imo.
Wow.. She has perfect teeth.
❤❤❤❤
Well doc, it would be easier to say where it doesn't hurt.
Giving strong Tina Turner vibes ... hair, outfit... loving it.
so sexy!!
🎼I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master. I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters🎼... Not cool, Miley. Not cool. Inspired much? :)
im sorry but their trilogy as song writers together is amazingly wicked.
A grown up Hannah Montana. Spring break song of 2024.
Estou simplesmente viciada
Trash song
Nice one fam, big up!
1:01 Rupaul cover for Supermodel of The World. Awesome.
Miley is G.O.A.T.E.D for life 👆
#somalilander_model #ck_caanka #hargeisa_queens #Somalilander_queens 0:52
Love it! Also shout out to Pharrell!!🥳
At this stage can’t discern the old version of Hannah is dreaming Miley or Miley is reflecting on her early career😂
Awsome song, babe❤
Super bowl 2025 please happen
She looks so vibrant and happy 😍
I'm a health worker and I didn't like this song.
SAY SY..........QUESTION.............I NEED A NURSE.......AND A DOCTOR........I NEED IT WORKED OUT........DO YOU ACCEPT OBAMA CARE???????????????????????????...... I WAS JUST ASKING.......LOL........ICON!!!!!!.......MUCH LUV MI SY.......
چهره خاص و زیبایی داره❤
Maravillosa, divina & amazing.!!!
porque esto me da vibes de Doctor Psiquiatra de Gloria Trevi?
She is giving me Tina Turner vibes...
i love youyoure a queen
Energy like Tina Turner
That hair makes her look like a 50 year old divorcée, of a massive oil tycoon, that is prone to drinking gin and tonics, having catty bitch fights, in 80s couture.
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
This Looks soooo fun
Cest de pire en pire 😂😂😂 de plus en plus vulguaire 😅 comme elle se comporte ca me choque lol jai jamai vu une chanteuse autant se la peter et pourtant ya pa de quoi elle est normal meme si elle se la pete plus haut quelle est perché... Il faut redescendre ma petite tes rien du tout tes juste une chanteuse et une comédienne rien d autre... Tu tes prit pour superwoman 😂😂😂
Una hermosura, y eso músico el coro, ella y ellos pueden representar la tierra, sin duda.
iconic  always
Skinny is not sexy
😂 thumbs down!
I really love Miley in her Tina Turner’s era 🔥
Genius singer, beautiful woman
Tina Turner eres tú?
like that!
Why this deceptive title? What's Pharrell's name doing here? Are we now falling into this name selling with no connection? And don't tell me he designed her outfit and that's the catch.
愛死了！！！！！！！！！這節奏、旋律，配上獨一無二的聲線真的完全打中
Miley, you look absolutely incredible and in this video and remind me so much of the timeless and the truly iconic Tina Turner, but you are an icon in your own right. Absolutely!
Is this a toothpaste commercial
Damn
I love it 🎉
This is fun❤ I'm obsessed w the shorts outfit I gotta remake it for myself😍😍
She looks happy ❤❤❤
Queen
Addicting
She potrays the meaning of the songs perfectly
What year does she think shes in? 🤦‍♀️
Glooming 🔥
I'm not gonna lie this song right here is lit is on my Spotify playlist too probably heard it more time's than I should've have 👏🏽💯
Superbowl 2025 need her for real 🎉
come on Miley. Join the ufo disclosure bandwagon. it need celeb power. annunaki reptilians created humans and likely control human sacrifice. the human soul is quantum in nature.
I love You Miley Cyrus so much I love You You You You You so much❤❤❤
What ... DID ... SHE ... DID ... TO ... HER ...TEETH!!????? IT LOOK SO FAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!
Okay sehe really switched roles with Beyoncé 😲
Bop after bop
❤
Fiquei esperando o Pharrell aparecer 🤡😂
Amazing! ❤️
From watching her on Hanna Montana, to this point…I’m so proud of her astronomical rise.
❤❤❤❤
The Greatest yet
Sounds good but like “I wanna be your slave” from Måneskin
Now become a doctor 💊💊💊
Slayage
The demo compared to this is insane. I still can't believe this song was meant to be on bangers.
This is not dancing ,She is just moving her hands
She felt like she had found the freedom she wanted. And she became a diva.!
This sounds just like I Wanna Be Your Slave by Måneskin
i'm actually so proud of her. seems like she's finally been coming into her own after the horror of things that usually happen to kids who get their start on disney channel/nickelodeon. She's incredible
Slayed so hard
Love her so much❤
i'm a bit confused now - let me think about it 🤔🥰
Giving me her god mother vibe dolly
Her new style I’m in love with!!!
I love Miley giving me the Dolly hair, and the party vibes while also feeling herself ❤🎉
i like the song but the video is kinda boring and lazy.🤷‍♀️
THE 1 ST BEST SONG FROM MILEY EVER !
She looks like a dollar
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a cool, classic paired down music video. Loved some of the moments like when she’s jumping and leaping in the air in the faux fur coat!
Am I crazy, or the 2-piece-metal(ish)-look is a Barbarella reference? Gorgeous outfit.
Amazing song....
❤❤❤❤❤
You can tell she was having the time of her life shooting this music video, she was vibing
puffy gums.
I now like Miley Cyrus more as a singer. THIS SONG SLAPS HARD
That's 30 seconds of my life I will never get back.  Good God.
Es linda talentosa hermosa voz no necesita de nadie para brillar 💖
She’s getting WILD and SEXY
I love that Miley does things her way. Super talented, stunning and just enough crazy.
Quanto Mi piacerebbe vederla e sentirla in un duetto con i Maneskin! 😍🥰😘
Iconic
Not me forgetting that Pharrell is a producer first and expecting him to sing
She is having fun with this song
Same as this one  https://youtu.be/e1gYDTdztsM?si=i1flIhpNgBVDaQf5
Para mi sera siempre una de las mejores cantantes que as dado este mundo !
i love this song it gives me late 2000s earlys 2010s vibes
Looks like the child of Tina Turner and Shania Twain
Sounds like that one group
❤
Nice song sexy girl

Sus dientes están terribles 💀
That opening is giving Maneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE vibes
i'm a say yes ...
Why do I feel like I'm watching Ru Paul doing Beyoncé? Where's Miley. Cy?rus
Miss old Miley. She has tried too hard to "reinvent" herself 5 times.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She looks like a young Jane Fonda
Immaculate
2:25 love that ❤

Funky, hapoy, jumpy, healthy and funny music and video. U rock girl!

Que cabelo é esse? Socorro. 😂😂😂
Es una fusion como de tina turner y  lady gaga
Miley Cyrus KATY party ❤❤❤❤❤❤ PLAY Pop ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤CONNOR
Watched it 5 times and i think for 3first ones i just was mesmerized with her energy alone❤
I feel like if this got mashed up with Gimme by Jill Scott it would be fire.
Its so a good song great work i love it❤
Miley is channeling Tina (Turner) on this vid 😍
Wow Miley is so so beautiful and sexy . Shes perfect in every way
no puedo dejar depensar en Laura León :C
Miley my love you are my spirit animal ❤
All I hear is “blurred lines” in the chorus
She is back
Ok, and Pharell where is ?💀 Is he even sing ?
Tá bom mulher, me dá a receita de dipirona
Maneskin vibe ;)

She looks like cher
Where was Pharrell singing?
Bella 😍😘😍
The beat is sick.
What is this?
😂😂😂
Maneskin intro?
Por que estás aabatida, ó minha alma, e por que te perturbas dentro de mim? Espera em Deus, pois ainda o louvarei, o qual é a salvação da minha face, e o Deus meu. Salmo 42:11 🤍🍃
I can´t understand what i Miley doing, but i love it.  (Maybe she is she, just being an icon)
Rock this!!❤

This dance is similar to the dance in the video Beyoncé Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)
I want Miley

She low-key looks like Cher here
It's giving lot lizard.
Close to Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines
Blurred LINES vibes..............I dont hate!
The real question is who is her dentist 😂 because they need a raise ASAP( Nothing was ever wrong with her teeth but damn she showed it 67 times 😂just saying)
Love this song, upbeat make me happy 😃

BEAT IS GIVING BLURRED LINES
Not sad that i have been listening to this song for years, but excited we finally got a video 😂😂😂🎉🎉
Miley Cyrus has matured into an amazing artist. I never used to like her older stuff, but now she's on fire!
The hair and that second outfit was giving Barbarella vibes…
Like the way energy vibes,!!her video 💥, her voice !!! Take your flowers ma'am!! Flower 💐, 💐
I like her natural body with no plastic surgery, no fake boobies, no fake ass, no fake lips... Just perfect naturality.
ate. down.
Work out, it's like BEYONCE SONG 😏
Для тех из вас, кто читает это: Желаю тебе улыбаться каждый день, быть сильным и стремиться к своей мечте.
I love how her whole video was just her being free, confident and happy💕💛
Been waiting for her to let her hair down
Im so proud of miley she came so far in her life since her hanna show <3 glad you got grammy award and another thing they say older u get the more older u are i say miley just gets hotter every year : }
doctor baby
miley
queen
the mesh outfit with the metal disc overlay stuff transported me to the hannah montana album cover so fast that I screamed with joy
Gnarl Barkley Crazy sample.
Ela encontrou seu ritmo, combinando com sua voz vibrante e e perfomance incrível 🎉❤
I know you want me  You know I want you  Pitbull?😁🫣
Love her , the dress , the hair! But I hate this song ! It’s just redundant and boring . Miley’s charisma sells the video but if I heard this just randomly without seeing her . I’d click next . Not every song is a hit . Sorry yall .
Let's make by gones be by gones and give me that sugar you can be my doctor or whatever work it out your my lover i am not on the fence i think i see your problem and its going to get worse work it out x
Still in my head ❤❤
Idc she looks stunning
Skank for life
"If I was you I'd wanna be me too"...I thought I heard this song before lol
I love the beat!❤❤❤Also, I kept restarting the video because the beat! Omggggggg!!!
cool
Not gonna lie, this is catchy as all hell.
추는춤은 마치 헬스장에 엄마들이 추는 줌바같은데 이언니가 추면 그냥 핫하다 😅😅😅
Aila salola oli ilmanen
Phantastisch Miley 🌹♥️🌹♥️🌹♥️
is it just me who expected to see pharrell williams
I can't wait to see the Drag Race lip sync that will surely come from this
Vassouras taperuaba sobra cicero augusto arraes de oliveira show carioca osonhador valeu linda a
She filmed this right after the Grammys
Not me feeling cheated but happy at the same time. I listened to this multiple times before realizing “Where is Pharrell?!” 😂😂😂 but I love this song and the vibes! It’s giving Tina and I’m here for it
WTF is this shit . Y'all get feed shit daily and eat it right up 😂
And I'm waiting for William's verse lol
So happy for the return of glam!!
Maneskin bruh
And her husband divorce this  body
Muito Deusa
She giving Tina turner vibes love the old school
Learning english with this song :)
So iconic!!!!
She seems so happy and grown... love this for her
Goddess^^
Não gostei. 👎
She is MOTHERING
I prefer flowers
This is awesome!
This has 'a little bit Alexis' energy
Except she cant dance whatsoever.  & im assuming this is choreographed . But still ...cringe .
So Pharrell needs himself another "Happy", I guess.
She is officially a goddess
❤❤
At first:This sounds like Maneskin, nope! At second: Miley and Maneskin would collab together and make rock song! NOW- I screaming in my room :  I COULD BE A DOCTOR AND I COULD BE A NURSE!😅😂❤
Today. Nice outfits.
Ya no ayan que  cantar
Giving barbarella x
The rhythm of this song reminds me of the song Maneskin - I wanna be your slave…
Me encanta la vibra 🔥👍
This song feels and sounds so nostalgic of 2015-16 pop yet it was uploaded a mere 9 days ago! I'm amazed This sort of artistic talent is still popular
sad story. from flowers to this.. hope to see better music in near future from her
Mantra 🙏🏻
catchiest song of 2024 easily
That thang is juicy
It’s giving Amy winehouse
hi. Can someone please help me find this song? I don't know the name nor the lyrics all I can remember it was anime  with a boy wearing a long brown coat with his girlfriend running from something at the end they both die on top of a mountain with one arrow they were hugging please help. Thank you
I guess Miley is workin' on 17s &  18s beats
Her dentist >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Finally a good song ❤
Lazy music production and the over the top hair and teeth is enough to make anyone recoil. This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen
❤❤❤❤
Omg I love this style!!
First... Where si Pharrell? 😅  Second... Is not a Bad song... but that dance 👎🏼🥴  Just sing, you are amazing at that!!!
I love Miley but where’s Pharell’s part? 😂😂
Each time I repeat this song I keep staring at different things and one of them was how white her teeth are. I’m jealous
Valkyrie ❤❤❤
#MILEY *this is one of my songs while I WORKOUT* ❤
she's feeling herself ❤
Sounds Like “I wanna be your slave” from Maneskin 🥱
Te amo miley cyrus
😊
OMG!  This is so much fun!!!  She looks gorgeous! The music and lyrics are so catchy and fun.  The outfits are perfect, she doesn't need to be almost naked to look ncredible.
Waiting since 2013
What happen to her? I'm like this I'm not going to lie but I miss the young miley and this new miley I don't care for.
She has definitely have been working out a lot
She looks weird for some reason??
I used to dislike her alot .. nowadays I'm in love with her music, her style and everything about her oozes class
Retirement home Banger.. 🍵🦈💜

Happy 10M
Best version of Miley ever
Its a full-on hit
❤
Yes mileyyyy !!
Why they all have to show their underpants ?! Miley,. Stop it. Music , singing , dancing doesn't have to be followed by nudity of any sort. Women are equal with men. Stop stripping female singers.
so great
Very much like Maneskin
we <3 Miley
im obsessed
'Doctor' is a masterpiece
she is the queen
i love this song so much
It's giving Kylie Minogue vibes
For start, be a hairdresser 😅
Enjoying herself
She stole this song
She stole this song
That fit and hair are serving some serious Tina Turner and I'm loving it
Jakie to jest dobre !! I ta piękna Miley ❤
It's like Tina Turner is in her
Copy of maneskin song.."I wanna be your slave "
God i thought this jane fonda hair was a one night thing.  It ages her wayyy to much
Miley is simply a "gidor" in our language 😊
Hmmm….https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=x8ENfP8HFCCEYtm9
And Pharrell?
Still pumped from the Grammy's ;)
uhm....so....this is what blurred lines would sound like if it wasnt halfway stolen from marvin gaye.....yikes
Good song
❤❤❤❤🎉
Guardano le movenze senza audio,mi ricorda Tina Turner
You are wonderful❤🎉
❤❤❤❤she will get bigger than she knows because she's so unique
MMMMMMM i c u guyss ❤‍🔥🔥🔥❤‍🔥
Molto simile a "I Wanna be your slave" dei Maneskin 😂
日本人のファンです🇯🇵🤍 楽曲も映像もビジュアルも全部かっこよくて素敵すぎます😿💖 中毒になること間違いなしですっ😻 マイリー大好きです😻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
She is so energik and beautiful
Reminds me of Maneskin
Why is no one talking about the hair? Hahaha i Love her but it’s not her best look
Oh my Miley 😳
She's done tons of plastic surgery. But she looks good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngIe7p3sA0
Tina Turner vibes 😊
This is a horrible song ouff
Listen Maneskin "I wanna be your slave", rock song. This is bad pop trash and copy.  Maneskin. ❤
OMG WE SHOULD ASK JOE IF WE CAN SING FOR THE INAUGURATION NEXT JANUARY
MILEY PLEASE VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN 2024. PLEASE TELL DAD TO VOTE FOR JOE TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Copy. Maneskin "I wanna be your slave". Thanks.
I don't like her moves.. Not natural. Like she taught them!
Miley's mistake why she did not sing this song as rock song and duet with Maneskin, not with stupid Pharrel. 🙄 She would be rock star, not this.
This sounds the same like song of Maneskin "I wanna be your slave" from 2021, but Maneskin version is better, it' rock nroll.
She is really great❤❤🎉
Where is the pharrel
Miley eres maravillosa ❤❤❤
Looking back through every music video she had ever done, I can easily tell that she finally found her true happy feminine style. So happy for her. I feel like this is the REAL Miley❤
Wow, that's pure Dynamite. Attention: Danger of Explosion
Where's the video where she's singing in French 😂 it's a big joke in France now 😅
ariana's new music video has more views in 1 day.
Hey Miley!! Im a fan since 2008, please do a concert in Manila.❤❤❤❤❤
Miley looks INCREDIBLE
How can anyone hate her?
What's your prescription for this nroken right to, Least i got some good tools, be limling for couple weeks, Ever seen me twist my ankle and soak it in a pond next day clean the cattle yard and catch gasoline can fire grab it be like fuck it.

Energy of women 😍🤩🥰💋💋💋💋💋🔥🔥🔥
I love it, their expressions are full of joy❤❤
Love seeing Miley looking like she’s genuinely having a fun time filming this 💗💗💗💗
I think it has something borrowed from maneskin I wanna be your slave... It's just me thinking that?
Sounds exactly like ‘I wanna be your slave’ by Måneskin

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT
stunning stunning stunning. ugh!
Who's Pharrell?😅
That hair lookin like Peggy from Married with Children
🔥🔥🔥
It looks like a shopping, store, markets kinda songs
Miley used to annoy the shit outta me, but she’s grown into her own and I love that husky voice. I also love how real she is. No plastic surgery. Two enthusiastic thumbs up 🖤🖤🖤 you’ve won me over
I like that it isn't hyper-choreographed. She just looks like she's having fun.
Pussycat Dolls + Måneskin vibes
Horrible
Um no
hahaha love the dance 🤣🤣🤣
I didnt want to like it...but anything with Pharrells energy just "works"...❤
Me da la impresión que Miley huele muy mal
If i see anyone sporting this hair style that’s not famous omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 just nooooooo that’s not it!!! Leave it for the run way or Miley sorry not sorry😂
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Scream it Miley
Thalia is that you?
Люблю тебя,люби меня таким,как есть.Не заставляй Вас убивать...
Anyone else hear I Wanna Be Your Slave by Maneskin?
New fav
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I didnt notice it until the song almost ended BUT HONEYYYY is her natural voice back????????? Those loud high notes at the end in the background are giving bangerz era omg
Please please, i need to know what are her shoes?!
Thank you for being a REAL woman kicking booty !
Love Miley ❤️✨
i love the songssssssss❤
I love her voice but this seems weird and hyper sexual. She’s a lot different than the Hannah Montana I used to watch as a kid.
A popular melodious song with a retro feel and beautiful works.
Love you Miley
Happy for you
Maravillosa miley te admiro tanto.deseo tener ese empoderamiento y belleza tuya.❤
I love that's she seems genuinely happy🌹♥️
Miley using clothes and dancing like Tina
❤😍🤩🤪
A Maneskin copy :)
Somehow reminds me of Jane Fonda.😊
C'mon now...HOW MANY OF U PPL/FANS realized there were 3 versions of this video in first 7 days??? Write a comment 🤩 and explain everything what u notice different 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼

MILEY!!! Hit up a brotha if you want some background dancers I am JAMMING!!!!

No me gusta su nuevo look, la hace parecer más grande de edad!
Jesus loves you, look for him and he will give you new life, you are important to God, receive the great gift of salvation today by accepting Christ in your heart
Miss Miley Cyrus... biiig respect all the years about ur performancees and mega Voice. But..... WHAT excactly will u tell us with ur naked body..??? I think, no not think... i know U`ve a biiiig problem with URself
She looks like Jane Fonda...
❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
- now this is “Party in the U.S.A” 👍
0:27 LOL, I love the way she dances!
She looks like Laura Hutton when she was younger 🤷‍♀️
Je veux tellement des dents comme Miley il sont original ahah Miley vien sur fornite 🎉❤❤❤❤❤
You're my loverr
❤❤❤🎉
Chjsjsjs @Natex4398
Angels like you don't fly with me ❤❤❤❤
era  timpul să facă și ea melodii mai ritmate nu numai melodii triste,foarte faină melodia dar mai mult cântăreața ❤
Miley,  No longer Hannah Montana, no longer seeking, YOU have arrived, stay the "lady's" class act, take care of your good health, stay strong, you are YOU now, you don't need to be like anyone else!
Is anyone going to talk about the sandals?
Miley, Miley like fine wine 🍷 you get better & better ❣️
WTF is this LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The riff that is doubled by the vocals strongly reminds me of maneskins song " I wanna be yor slave"
Aging like wine!!!she’s gorgeous!!!!
Work it out woman
❤
I feel this a perfect representation of hook-up culture and why everyone complains and about how there are “no good quality” people out there. She looks beautiful, but the “don’t waste my damn time” part is her knowing she’s gonna face heartache, at some time. The object of the song will either out right reject her, or hook up a few times before ghosting her and never returning her calls.
Bull sh it , Pharrell whas one of my Favorite Producer, now is just Trash and act gu y
@justdance there is potential
miley did to much plastics
This has a groovy beat and Miley is undeniably fit and talented, BUT this is cheap, raunchy & completely unoriginal, just like a million other songs out there. She took the boring, lazy road here. Anyone can gyrate awkwardly to 70's-ish music while making fake sultry grunting noises & spouting thinly veiled innuendos. Sad.
Reminds me so much of Beyonce's style.
So interesting to see Miley bloom and evolve . She is finding a new style progressively it seems and it's greeeeeaaaaat ❤
Jesus is King 👑
türk şarkıcı "yıldız tilbe" dansı.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAc7_vaXUeE
Lovely song, but crap video : bad dance
Them veneers go hard!
Rock
Good song
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Godess
This is so similar to Maneskin! Kind of plagiarism!) I think so, but the song is pretty good!
Stolen by maneskin
Miley is a good singer
she's looking so happy and gorge
This is beyond boring and that hair is a mess
Gooooo girl

Such a glorious existence ❤️😍. Keep it going girl. You rock !!!
Love you ❤❤❤
Love her with long hair😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Simplesmente linda e talentosa 🎉👏👏👏💃

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can we see a Mariah Carey Miley Cyrus action at some point? I wish Pharrell would work with these two.
Hannah Montana in her 30s🤧
This is giving Tina Turner vibes
Woaaaah she is her moms TWIN
Can sonmeone tell me what inspired her dancing moves? Or did her choreographer/miley herself invent it?
i love this sm!!
I should not love this song and video so much 🥰
Perfect outfit, catchy tune, fit girl, great voice. Sure hit!!!!❤❤❤❤
Does anyone else see that she looks like Vanessa Williams?!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Another huge hit...what a fantastic combination pharrell and miley ..love this song!!
Se ve muy bien 👍🏻 cero vulgar 👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Whats with filming into her mouth, teeth and lips in her videospots. It's annoying.
Doctor Miley love this song 😉
This is so catchy ❤
Let's give a shout out to the hair stylist for such a long-lasting hairstyle!😅
This video has the same energy as Dr doofenshmirtz and perry the platypus doing the exercise song LOL
Cool ❤
This song is a BOP ❤
Great ❤
Plagiarism of  Maneskin - Slave! 😮😮😮😮
Yes, yes, Miley
There is something concerning about her face. She really does look crazy 😢.
The epitome of the white girl dance
Yeah
❤❤❤

Dope  came along way she still a wild won but looks like a woman in those video
temazo
I love Hannah Montana ❤
What part of the video do u wanna be on? Miley: YES!!!
This gives me Shania Twain mix with Dolly Parton vibes on the hair look
Good song miley❤
The close up on her mouth reminds me of 7 Things🙃
Love it!!! I feel like Miley is channeling the late great Tina Turner!! 😊❤🤘🔥
Sa chanson chante: https://youtu.be/gkCV_2HfPtU?feature=shared

Let the woman dance! 🎉
Just being able to tell that she’s having so much FUN makes it contagious.
❤❤❤ vote
Goddammit ❤🎉💃
And Liam let this go 😂😂🎉 work it momma!
Her music style has evolved so much! 'Flowers' is a testament to the new Miley Cyrus era.
I love ❤️ me some Miley and Flowers is my favorite song but the lipstick 💋 💄 color in this video is all wrong and her lips 💋 look like worms 🪱  to me. Lol. She is stunning & so talented!  She just needed a different shade of lipstick 💄 dangit! 😂
我覺得這首歌耳朵聽起來的感覺真的沒有這麼的流暢😂
*meenarme moviendo caderas* *suena de fondo "Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams - Doctor (Work It Out)"*
Woah keep it up milley❤
How did u know I'm going through this now? Feeling so miserable. 😔💔 Hope to have that end. I'll let you know if that happens.   Like me to remind me of this.
Vibe bem Tina Turner.
Is anyone else hearing Maneskin's I Wanna Be Your Slave in this?? Credit should be given to them for at least the bass line, right??
She looks happy and absolutely in love with herself! ❤️🔥Stunning!!
This song is amazing Miley!❤
😊
Am I the only hearing Thriller beats in the background..... Michael must be turning in his grave
MI NIÑAAAAAA
This is Robin Thicke blurred lines, no?
I'm loving it Miley ❤😘😘😘😘
Someone will eventually do a dance challenge on tiktok with this song playing 😂
Dónde está Pharrell Williams? Me quedé esperando en toda la canción que en algún momento hiciera su intervención 🤷🏼‍♂️
Me encantaaaaaaa❤
Ela tá tão linda cara nessa nova fase
This is too addictively positive i love it
Miley i love u 4 ever but now talk to u in Italian: perché copiare i @maneskin...ma con tutti i tuoi talenti fai una canzone completamente nelle tue corde,io la adoro ma l'Italia e Italy....di a Pharrell di consigliarti meglio 😂 comunque bravissima
Where is Pharrell in this?
Really think Pharrell should produce an unreleased AALIYAH track.
Oh my God Miley, how many good things you have for this year Total renewal ❤🎉
Suena como esas canciones que salen en las peliculas de comedia de bajo presupuesto.

Is Måneskin tune in the air?
2017 demo was shy. 2024 is her time.❤
I love how Miley Cyrus is just happy and dancing and enjoying herself in this music video 😅🤍
Miley es bonita pero aquí su maquillaje se  parece mucho a Anahí de RBD igualitas obvio su música Miley 💯 veces mejor
I love Miley's eternal fire and this choreo. She's a musical genius.
Sounds a lot like Maneskin, I wanna be your slave...
omg love her
So much Jane Fonda feels right there 🤩
Are these not Katya moves?😂
She has great teeth 🦷
Love you Miley you do your thing you are absolutely beautiful. i just want to say that the hairdo does not compliment you it makes you look older. You are to pretty to have a puff 60's hairdo
Ok. Se operó la cara o se agrando los dientes?.
She is living her best life and I am here for it!
Just me thinking she's channeling Jane Fonda?
🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷
Awesome Miley💥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥♥️
Y si la reina dice que yo puedo ser tu doctora quien soy yo para negarme ❤
Can't stop replaying Pharrell Williams' part 😍
I love how much fun she seemed to have filming this. The smiles and laughs seem genuine, and it gives off a vibe like this wasn’t choreographed (I’m sure it was, but it looks almost like she just waltzed on set ready to dance. Love it!)
I didn't like the zoom in to her mouth 😅
She looks like a snack , im so glad she has long hair again. Hated her look back in 2013-2014
Felicidades por tus Grammys 🏆🏆 Sigue cosechando éxitos musicales y personales, más que merecidos. Insinuar a tu papá sin nombrarlo, nos demuestra lo mucho que lo amas, y es obvio, ha sido tu apoyo musical durante toooooooooooda tu carrera. Sabes una cosa, si lees las líneas de sus manos, allí debe estar ese 2do matrimonio y sus cosas importantes siguientes, inevitable, son karmas de otras vidas. Lo que le ha hecho tu mami a tu hermana, eso si no está nada pero nada bien, debería divorciarse ya, ese hombre también es un inconsciente de primera línea 👎   Reflexiona sobre tu papá, y lo maravillosos que ha sido contigo sieeeeeeeemmmmmmpre, has sido bendecida, hazlo antes de que ya no lo tengas, luego recapacitas, y aparecen los arrepentimientos y lágrimas; disculpa que ante tanta felicidad actual te recuerde ese trago amargo, es que me pasó con mi padre, y me arrepiento, sufro, lloro cada día, y le pido perdón a su alma, por mi falta de comprensión oportuna, que ya no puedo enmendar 😪 Porfa, no me bloquees, te quiero para bien. Un abrazo😇
Look at that skeletal structure. Do a little bit of research. This is a male - just like most in the music and movie industry. Clown 🤡 world 😂
The 🤚 of  pharell ❤
Go go go just do it Admire
Miley, que piernas te has formado, no te vayas a dividir los músculos, así están perfectas 😝
She is a SPITTING IMAGE of her mother. It’s insane!!
The high energy was awesome, I loved this song and video!!  I was toe-tapping all the way threw ☺
What the hell happened to Hannah Montana ?!
Young Tina!!!
👍
Where is Pharrell Williams? I was waiting for him to appear.  What a waste of time. I am really disappointed.
miley is legend❤
She looks so healthy and toned, not sure what she is doing but she should keep it up! Keep working it out girl!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Go Miley
Tina Turner and Dolly Parton vibes
Miley>
Her perfect smile, her energy, the music and dancing❤️ everything perfectly balanced🙏
Yessss
❤❤❤❤❤❤
She’s perfect
Grammy #2
Little too much Tina turner wanna be, maybe its a fase :) in My opinion.
Brilliant!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!
It's sounds exactly the same as "I wanna be your slave- Maneskin" 😢
The song is boring but she is 🔥🔥🔥🥵❤
Appealing to all of the white women in the United States
Literally my favourite person ever
Perfecta ❤
❤❤❤❤
I love Miley, but can we get an era where her teeth are shorter because GIRL - those are so bad. Everything looks great in her photos, etc, but those teeth. Its like she can't even close her mouth. She was and is way too pretty for those fake jawbreaker breakers.
yassssssss !!! grown up Miley i love it !!! shes giving me Angelina Jolie gorgeous vibes !!!! yasssssss snap
Se parece a Maria Mercedes 😅
She looks amazing and all, but i cant get past her hair! Shes taking her idolization of Dolly a little to far!
https://youtu.be/6PXWFxfvZPg?si=fnfgOScqvdkINTnO
Miley is a legend music best artist album songs very excellent and clear voice ❤️❤️❤️😍🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰👍👌👏
And where is Pharrell Williams?🤔
Are you a drug addiction?
Inspiring music video ❤😊🎉
OMG! Congrats Miley...Dr. Amen (his name just jumped out at me, when I was going to say he was a miracle worker!) I sure wish that I could see him for a while and see if he can do for me as much good as he has you! I'm sure you're feeling is good inside as you look outside. I was wondering if I would ever listen to your music again cuz I just didn't really care for you. I liked  Wrecking Ball and that was about it. Now I could become addicted and pray that some of your self-esteem and confidence wears off on me you absolutely look fantastic you even sound better! You must have found the new drug that Huey has been singing about, the one that allows your true being out and makes you feel you are good enough without trying to convince everyone that you're at your best and love yourself, that you don't have to fit in to your Cyrus family and reputation, you are your own great person now! It even seems that your legs have gotten longer! You are absolutely 🫦 💥SPECTACULAR!! Nowadays you deserve flowers no matter where they coming from.
Wow!!! ❤❤❤
Loves
SHE HAD TO GIVE SOME FIGHTS IN LIFE..SHE WON AND NOW SHE IS JUST MAKING AWESOME WORK. SHE SHINES!!!!
WOW!!!THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC!!!! MINIMAL. DYNAMIC, SEXY, NATURAL BEAUTY!!!! THANK YOU.
I could be your doctor, or I could be your nurse 🕺🏻
chanson au top clip simple mais génial très heureuse d'etre fan de cette femme depuis ses débuts. Elle a une super belle évolutions musical je trouve <3 I Love You Miley
Miley gives me Blanche Devereaux vibes from the character of Rue McClanahan in Golden Girls❤❤❤...love love love❤❤❤❤
Her personality her beauty her VOICE ❤❤
Paying homage to Tina Turner I like that❤
She is affected by Maneskin😂 what a pity
If J-Lo and Angelina Jolie had a baby
Miley is such a fashion gurlie! I love it
she is vibing tina turner....she is having fun. good for you!!
Good maybe but this is music what is not for me
i kept thinking pharrell williams was gonna start singing hahaa but i’m not complaining i love miley
Iconooo
This song feels like it belongs in the 60's 😊 I'm bored with both the song and the MV   Why am I not impressed?
She lost charm
I really like Miley, I don’t like this particular video though, something is off, maybe I just don’t like the song.
👏🏻
But WHY is it so heavily photographed??
❤in love with the energy❤
She's basically perfection
It's Impossible to take your eyes off of her so that's why they decided to shoot the video like this
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tina Turner vibes
get this shit off the airways dog.....
I love so Much ❤✨
Ah!
My babies! 🥰🥰
Nose ustedes pero esta nueva miley no termina de convencerme 😢 siento que ya parece señora de 50+ y solo tiene 30 wtf xd
8M argentina ❤❤
This song is amazing I love Miley Cyrus ,,🎉🔥💖
Miley is great ❤ She reminds me of Jolie in some way, only younger😊
If you haven’t yet, definitely listen to her Heart Of Glass remake, phenomenal
Looks like Vanessa Williams. Hair/face. Doesn’t it??
Am I the only one that just hears Hannah Montana singing the "Bone Dance?"
She brings the party vibes all the time
Im still waiting for Pharrell
Sounds similiar to maneskin's song "i wanna be your slave"
💚🎶
The close up the goofy teeth and sunken cheeks is def not sexy lol
Am I missing something where tf was Pharrell at ?????? What is the point of saying their name and not showing them at all leave it in the credits not the title. lol false advertisement if you ask me
Let's be clear, the hair and hairdresser alone deserve their own credit.  I hear Shania at her best?
Beyoncé?? Are you there? Single Lady
Miley the legend that you are
Wonderful
Love all the weak and insecure haters … it’s definitely the ones that can’t afford it … and we know you were the fat friend and you’re all still so angry. Get over it 😂😂😂😂😂 this doctor is an artist
I thought was beyonce
Versatility Queen
Masterpiece
Tina turner vibes ✨
Pharrel Williams?😀
Miley looks wholesome in 🔵 outfit.
Halleluja Pharell !!
Почему мне кажется что у нее немного не хватает??😅
This is a bop. It's a great transition into summer and Miley's goddess era. I hope her next album is dance. I'd like to see what pours out of her. Additionally, this is a really great concept for the video. Simplicity is hard, but this video is perfection. 10/10.
Love the video love the song Miley you’re fantastic we love you❤❤❤❤❤
I hear subtleties of dolly pardon & shania twain this is awesome to see her grow from Hanna Montana!❤
Sounds like I wanna be your slave by Maneskin
i cant keep my eyes off of her teeth 😂
We’re over doctors and nurses. We need some inner spiritual healing.Bring us evolution.
Not even a verse from Pharrell
I Love it
❤work it Miley
Why does she remind me of Jane Fonda?
She looks like Tina Turner now
I love it so much ❤
This is absolutely terrible. Wow.
I love her teeth. Am I the only one?😅
Anyone hearing the resemblance to maneskin's slave?
She looks incredible
She is a DIVA ❤
Ayyyyyee miiiley💃
Guapísima de morena,otro grammy para ella,es una Diva❤❤❤❤
LIKE TINA
Great video, horrible song.
Truly talent
Queen forever
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
I'm 62 and I just love her 😅❤
Iconic!!!
Ну это моё ядерное оружие.
She would be a legend like her Goodmother Dolly Parton she's so brilliant!! Go girl.♥️
I like your hair style ❤❤
I love seeing even best version of Miley after breaking up with her ex ♥️🌺✨
This is laughably hideous
That tongue is everywhere😂
This song kinda close to the song 100 percent pure love.
Terrible dancing
Love the energy!!!Reminds me of Jane Fonda from her “workout” video days 🥰
i’m obsessed with her black and silver dress
You are everything
Pharrell is not in the video but I love the song
I love ❤
Who was the choreographer? 👎🏽👎🏽 Good song, horrible choreography...Good Lord
Its giving tina turner
its giving bangers era mixed with who owns my heart and I love it
Gorgeous
Whoever told her to mimic single ladies...... was misguided. Dgmw it's still a jam, but I do think comparison's will be made....
👍♥️🐝🦷👯‍♀️🇺🇸
I heard this song at least 20 times today and I can't get enough!
Culture vulture
I adore ❤❤❤❤
Love this ❤
I love this song ❤❤❤
Only here for Trevor Wallace's 2 scene in the entire movie 🤟🏼🤟🏼💯🔥🔥🔥
Dude she looks SO good!!!
HAPPY WOMEN DAY❤❤❤
Love the outfits
I Came here for Pharrell Williams but I see nobody...
Please come and do a show in the UK soon
По крайней мере она не голая как обычно в ее клипах и без алкоголя и наркотиков
Amazing! ❤
Do I see a white beyonce? I do and I'm here for it
All guy and men would be horny if hear this song. "aaaahhhhhhh"
Mi się nie podoba 😢
Mi
just her and the background, and she rocks the song.
just took wednesday adams hand move and built the whole mv around it...kinda sad, had potential for something original
This video reminds me of @BritneySpears #3 ❤
I was unreleased back in 2012
The song isn’t really my thing but I love watching Miley have fun and try new styles of music. I think she’s in a really healthy and creative place which is so good to see! After growing up watching her and seeing her go through so many hard times, I will always want the best for Miley ❤
She looks exactly like her mother. There’s a weird throwback vibe going on & the hair is bigger than her whole body.
Love The MV anD The SonG☝😎🍼
Muito admirável essa fase madura dela. Mostra  uma mulher bonita, talentosa e muito elegante. Não precisa ficar pelada pra mostrar sensualidade.
Miley is old...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great song  Miley wouldn't fix you,you would feel worse when you were but what a way to feel bad
Someone should do a mashup of Miley’s Work it Out & Beyonce’s Work it Out also produced by Pharrel 😉
She looks 57
After got her grammies she came back home and made this song
Givin Ann Margaret and Wednesday Adam's vibes
The bomb!!! Finally some real music (not that depressing stuff everyone else is spinning). Go Miley
She's having so much fun 🎉❤
😂😂😂😂
Miley marry me
❤❤❤❤❤
Sympathy 🤘🤟👌
This is giving everything I’ve needed and more
This energy is contagious 🌸🌸
This is a song for adults.  For WOMEN. For MEN. For NONBINARY GROWN FOLK. Like if I heard a kid singing this, I'd look at them sideways. It's the kind of song that says everything and nothing. 10/10. This is the kind of not subtle subtly I desire from my grown up music. hahahahaha
come on everyone lets do the trex dance hahahahaha
Im obviously late to the party, this song is amazxxxxZzzzzing!!!!
She is the Queen !!!
Yassssss!!!!!!
Love this!! Reminds me of https://youtu.be/4WB6c1Cph9w?si=aFPq0xcBiooIAb-7
How good does Miley look? We need her workout! 👏
Juro que pensé que era Thalia!
W tej wersji mam wrażenie jakby powróciła Wielka Tina Turner jestem pod wrażeniem wszystko na plus
Good
The early 2000s Miley is back! She is revived! WOOHOOO!!!
There is no Dana only Zuul. 😅 love her ❤️
17Kth Commented 💙 : We're back again to this video after more than 7 days.
Обожаю эту девушку 🔥🔥🔥какая она классная ❤
Yeews
Maybe I am just to shortsighted of the truth. But am I the only one who thinks this is an awkard performance? And that she looks unhealthy? It looks like she is just moving something with her dancemoves and there is no real idea to it.. and it looks rigid
Just cuz she performed a tina turner song doesn't mean that she should continue what the hell dances is she doing 🗑️🗑️
I fuckin loveee Miley Yu go girl 🔥🔥🔥💯
Mediocre
❤
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
If Mick jagger was a woman and his parents were Tina turner and Dolly Parton...
Cuerpazo🙃💥😽
I’m getting Tina Turner vibes, and I’m not mad about it
I can see what people are saying about hollywood pumping out garbage like miley pharell and taylor swift, this song isnt dancable its not catchy, its noise to fill the void, I'd prefer the silence. Pharell did a fundraising event for the genocidal idf, thats all you need to know about these people.
I like her but man those veneers are bad
❤❤❤❤❤❤
TE AMO
Damn she can move 😂😂😂
Love this!
This song sounds like something that was out before by Pharrell
The song sucks.
I love this! Not even sure why?!
Reintroducing ‘Tina Turner’ vibes….!
Ugh... nothing special here...
Iam like an Doktor 🤓💚
Projecting  Tina Turner vibes with her never-ending Barbie legs!
Shes beautiful.  The hair is awful. I do not want to see more women walking around with that hair.please stop Miley.
Is it something you want to do
❤❤❤❤❤
This is the best GAP commercial I have ever seen.
Sounds like maneskin meets uptown funk hah
Seriously what's with the hair🤷🏻‍♀️ catchy song though. It's looking very Tina Turner
Así te queremos ver contenta❤
Miley, this video is everything I’m happy through the screen for you
Miley’s been lifting some weights! She looks amazing!
❤❤❤
Work it out 🎉🎉❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Berta's Daily Top 10 Mar. 8, 2024 Top 10 Yesterday: 10 Peak: 10 Days: 5
So much recycled garbage from Pharrell.  He dulled down the career and reduced popularity of Gwen Stefani,  Madonna,  Justin Timberlake and now miley cyrus.  Please stop working with him.
I came for a video collaboration with Pharrell. Got lots of hair and veneers. Not bad but whut up.
This music video is every dancer's worst nightmare. Her moves and posture are disturbing
Good grief many haters in these comments 😒.  This song is a BOP 🔥
Shaking, High confidence 😃 Love it.
I love this song. 😊
I don’t know how to feel about this. 😐
Shades of Ann-Margret.
P H E N O M E N A L !
This is amazing!!!
Flowers มี Miley 1 คน Doctor มี Miley 3 คน  ทั้ง 2 เพลง ร้องเอง เล่นเองคนเดียว  Flowers ได้ดูวิว Doctor ดูแค่ Miley   Great!!
*Its like she took Tina Turner, Cher, Madinna and Beyonce and mixed them in a Pharrell Smeg blender.*  🪩🎤🪩
Does this beat almost sound like  Robin Thick's song he had?
Idk if I like how she looks now still deciding just use to what she use to look like and now she looks so much more older and mature
Respect to Miley and Pharrell but this is not where it's at.
What's with her weird dance moves,?
this is a new miley cyrus genre
Waited for Pharrell 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I must have said something bad. My account got hacked. I can't access it.
I love the energy in song
Way 2 much wind!
Was this song written and produced by a large language model?
THIS SONG IS SO GOOOOD
She trys really hard
Miley
What is it song about?
Miley in her Tina Turner phase...work it out.
Yass!  Miley has arrived. She looks amazing.
Ann Margaret moves. Classic cool.
The same Grammys winner' energy❤❤
I liked the song a lot but was definitely waiting for Pharrell’s verse…😅
😮❤❤❤
Um... where's Pharrell? This song's mood boost is good, but no Pharrell means this video is not making me feel well. 😅
LOVE the energy!
😐😕
Cute video
I love you Miley, but this song is terrible. I can’t believe this is yours.
Perdy Perdy
She's actually STUNNING! Like YES to this natural brown hair with honey tones and the "Bob Mackey-esque" Cavali styling.
Now where in this video was it ft Pharrell 😂. Got me waiting on Pharrell just to realize he just made the beat.
Me encanta !!! I LOVED 😍
Miley C. The weather witch
I’m loving this ❤❤ yes Miley!!!
Wow!
Okay Mikey!
She more cute n have energy positif in this era.
anahi?
Im leaving this comment so when someone likes it I will get reminded of this masterpiece
The moment Pharrell jumps into the scene... Breathtaking
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
When 31 is the new “desperate, bad life choices” 51
It's giving if Miley Stewart had made it instead of Hannah Montana 😅..but seriously her hair is reminding me of her Breakout Album days...anyone remember that? 😄
Gnam Gnam 🤳🤝❤
Not crazy about the song, but love her hair and her moves super hot!!! song I am not crazy about not my sound. but love Miley for setting the new trends! She is great at it.
HAIR STRAIT FROM THE GRAMMY GIRL?!!! USeja OZEMPIC!!!
I love her new style 😍
Gorgeous!!!!! She is absolutely stunning!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Tina Turner + Jane Fonda 😊
Where is Pharrell?
Che schifo...
this "work it out" part sounds familiar
he's gonna get sued by marvin gaye's fam again. this is literally just blurred lines all over again.
Fenomenal.
Y Pharrell????😅😅😢😢😢
she never goes away
The intro is similar to Måneskin 'i wanna be your slave'  ❤
Not me dancing while on the treadmill. OMG Miley my girl I love you so much!
No surgery needed like all these black girls!
Wanna be Tina Turner😂
The video is dumb
She looks good. She cover up and she looks good. Sing great love the style. You still could be sexy covering your body
Brazilians will like this coment!
Milley sempre linda
worst tattoos lol
Esta mujer puede hacer lo q se le cante dios es  tan diosa❤this woman can do whatever she wants.. goodness ❤
Dziwna choreografia 😂
Très belle chanson..❤❤❤
Pharrell is a clickbait 🤔
Maneskin
Hab  von pharrel Williams nicht gehört
she’s straight serving face but looks like a 45 year old gym addict
Tina Turner's vibe and style sweating from this video! Like it
Everyone look at my new veneers-Miley
Look at this video twenty years down the line and tell me what goes off.
her moves 💃🔥
Miley please help  the practice of horror https://youtu.be/Qhc4hIbLXlM?feature=shared ❤u
The hidden meaning of the song is she’s telling us she had buccal fat removal (plastic surgery in the cheeks) and got veneers. She “worked out” her old self and is in a constant state of “improving”  She looks good but theres something a little too perfect about her now. Idk.
Manna Hontana <3
She's never looked happier, healthier or more herself <3 love love love to see it!!!
Is it just me or the beginning of the song is almost equal to Maneskin’s “I wanna be your slave” 😲?
Also what happened to Pharrell's verse?
Miley is way too skinny..Girl put on some curves!
I love it! But also reminds me "I wanna be your slave" from maneskin
I love this song, ♥♪
Pharrell loves a dance bop
Wasnt this a reject from bangerz era??😅
HERMOSA COMO BRILLA  SU EX LA ESTABA PERJUDICANDO
So authentic
❤❤❤❤❤
I wanna be your slave I wanna be your master... ✌️
Me recuerda mucho a Lady Gaga... especialmente en algunos pasos 😂
Been listening to this song during my morning workout the past couple days.
La amo❤
Reminds me of Tina Turner ❤
Free falastin
I want to get new jeans and sneakers
Love uuuu
Tina Turner !!!!!!!
I love the Tina Turner's vibe that Miley gives in this mv!!! So cool.  And she looks amazing!!!
I never saw Miley that free and happy ❤
I only dream of your happiness, privately and professionally. Fingers crossed. Greetings from Poland 🇵🇱♥️🌟
pasadaaaaaa
the way troye could slay this dress and choreo!!!!
cant wait for yuqi to cover this song pls yuqi 🤚🏻🤧
She carrued same hairstyle as in grammy.......she like it so much
FREE PALESTINE 🍉
MÅNESKIN vibe
Love Miley, she looks and sounds amazing, this song isn't for me though
❤️🔥
Some parts of this song sound like plagiarism to me (maneskin - I wanna be your slave)
Qu'est ce que c'est que cette merde ?
Sounds like Maneskin's I Wanna Be Your Slave
80s vibe will kill me
this song is like drug
Miley tiene la combinacion de la gran Tina Turner y el peinado de Dolly Parton
❤❤❤❤
music ?
💛🤘🇬🇪
Just know you're on some shit if you prefer taylor swift over miley.
So Miley & Beyonce traded places??  Tf is going
Something is off aboit this song & video. I feel like this is not her vibe & she's not really into this.
Maneskin?
Where is Pharrell?
This is Wats meant when they happy girls are the prettiest u smile as soon as u see her having so much fun !
Lemme lemme
❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤮🤮🤮
É a continuação do Grammy...flowers ❤❤❤
Is it just me or seriously this beginning sounds like a Måneskin- I wanna be your slave?
❤❤❤❤
Im feeling Tina Turner.
❤❤❤
This song sounds very familiar and didn't she do this ridiculous dance at the Grammys to 'Flowers'?
Eu amo!
Pharell rips off everything he listens to. Maneskin, Marvin Gaye, Motown, himself…it’s quite a weird vibe.
Love u Miley ❤
you can work it out ❤
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤ divina
She looks like Jane Fonda - snd that is a hell of a compliment
Where Pharrell at Miley 👀
i love nowdays Miley. she rockssss🫶🏻✨✨
Always a 4 count to all songs that Pharrell produced 💯🔥🔥🔥
İf Beyonce and lady gaga has a daughter
❤❤❤❤❤
Love it 🥰
Literal queen
Love the song but the video doesn’t match the song.
Body and Jawline on fire!!❤
This world is finished!!
When i see "pharrel" i know the song is going suckkkk
Nice Måneskin cover song  https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=BVQGt_RNKTj9jM87
❤❤❤❤❤
The dance moves remind me of Ann Margaret in her dance scene in bye bye birdie.
Miley sendo Miley, autêntica!
Dj from Mars just remixed this.  😂
I loved all the eras and versions of Miley  Cyrus she’s always been my favorite since Hannah Montana no matter what
Love this song! Obsessed with the first dress too!
You can bi my doctor 😊 I kn you will work it out
Miley is having so much fun and i'm here for it 🔥
te amooooooooooo
I’m so glad to see her as a long haired brunette again!! ❤😅
Choreo by Dula Peep
Bu kadına bu saç modelinin güzel olduğunu söyleyenin...
Everything is awesome except hair
The feral child from Mad Max. Love the hair!
first minute of the song I thought that she forgot to change after Grammy performance. Absolutely identical styles and even dance movements and energy. Not bad though
How’d her team allow her to do a music video with a blotchy spray tan on her hands and elbows??
I've got a problem doctor. I can't stop listening and watching this video 😅🔥💃
Trashy..
Pharrell is a Dj?
Please make another "Performance Video" in a saloon with a line dance. This wave gotta grow ms cyrus.
Very quirky 😂
I love how much fun she is having in this video! ❤️
anyone else who thinks she really has Angelina Jolie-vibes in this look ?
😀😀
The best song
Heihehhejgegkehejgri
I love it
shes so stunning living for her brown hair
so obsessed with this song and video!!! I've loved Miley forever and I'm so here for this new Miley!!
A dublagem dela não combina.. a dublagem parece que tá gritando..   E  a música eh calma..  😅..   digamos que o clipe ficou peculiar.   Hehe
She could rock a 80's neon leotard and  shorts exercise combo.
Gassing up the most basic song in 2024 is crazy lol
She looks amazing.
Let's work it out?
who told her to dance like this? did they record the video before or after the grammys? that's the same hair and outfit lol
Cute but all I see is hair, veneers, and dress
Why she Always showing her mouth ?
Ese vestido me gusta esta divino❤
Ese pelo no me gusya ni un poco como cannnta si
Maneskin vibes
all the singe ladies
She’s giving Mick Jagger, Tina Turner and recreating herself like Madonna. That’s life, we all change and grow (hopefully!) the energy is palpable! Go get it girl! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I love this new look ! From the clothes to the hair and Genius video ❤
Bes
People keep saying this video reminds them of Tina Turner, but all I can see is Jane Fonda. I think it's the hair and face structure.
love it
so the first part of the choreography is a cyru´s version of Wednesday´s dance 🤔
does the beat reminds you Maneskin??
After Flowers, this song doesn't sound striking. Flowers was felt like a lightning strike from the first second.
Where is the voice, i see a body but i didn't hear the voice
Nice song and good vibes 👌 Btw it's me or something's little strange with her teeth ..?
Tina Turner Miley is my favorite Miley era 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 you’ve earned it bitch.
These people desperately need a lyricist
I love her & I love the voice but this song didn't hit it for me.
I love her & I love the voice but this song didn't hit it for me.
Дика-Дика Жінка!))))
This is performance🎉❤
W I MANESKIN
😀 She is so cute! I'm so happy she won a Grammy...she deserves it!
Where's pharrells part?
No me gusta la canción
Everytime i see miley i fall in love a lil more each time. Love her evolution as a person and artist. Im here for everything she does.
I like Miley and Pharrell but I just don’t get this song…
Maneskin i wanna be your slave !! STOLEN
She is an icon, she is a legend and she is the moment
Looks like she recorded This video on the backstages of the Late Grammys, anyway ,she is gorgeous.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
clothes, dance, rhythm perfectly on style!!! ❤❤🎉 i wish miley get more votes on billboard and Pharrell helped it!
YASSSSS COME ON MILEY ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hope she's healthy and well cause her body is GOALS.
bora curtir essa pedrada na renner
Love this!!!
PATHETIC!! The most IRRITATING SONG & VIDEO I've seen in a LONG TIME!!
Excelente
The fan in the video could of been stronger for the hair .
What a great song to work out to. ❤ I love her Tina Turner era
Flopped so hard 😂😂😂
❤🎉🎉🎉
Great song by a gorgeous woman... ;-)
😊
Pharrel never made a good song ffs. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
I love it ❤❤❤❤
She's old
Miley always🔥🔥🔥
Nice.. awesome.. makin menjadi-jadi nih satu ❤
Most likely it will be his problem, if you want to make songs well done don't copy you have maneskin
In the beginning, I almost started with "Everybody get up!". It's SO blurred lines! Luv it! ♥
Love Miley but this hair , 😩🤣🤣🤣 I can’t wait for her to change it ❤
Where's Charles Brockman when you need him😅
She looks like Beyoncé right here with the hair and dress
Zaithiam ltk nu❤️🥰😍
Clearly, she’s been in her good life
She doesn't need a job she has one being a singer she needs to be in more movies and tv shows
That fire in her....❤
Queen👑✨
This song is so good
❤❤❤❤❤
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Eeeeeww Miley’s gross to me. Lol
Hated this song at first but here I am for the 6th time today🙃
Work it
❤❤❤❤
essa música e clipe vieram no momento certo da carreira dela, ta gostoso demais de ouvir
Miley is that girl
The true definition of Artist , Authenticity and Versatility.❤❤❤
Bop
Every time she reinvents herself I love it
Wow, shes really starting to look like her mom! Love her voice❤
Essa mulher é um furacão, sua evolução  é incrível, um arraso 😍🇧🇷👏👏❤️
Immaculate
Do the damn thang Miley!
I dont care for the song but her energy is contagious! Go Miley!!
OBSESSED.
Love her enthusiasm archhhhh
😂😂😂😂

LA MEJOR REPRESENTACION DEL MUNDO ARTÍSTICO. LA MAS COMPLETA LEJOS ❤
Dolly Parton x Madonna 100% no doubt about it
omg crazy girl🩷
Creo que la voz de esta mujer, así como la escucho actualmente, esta demasiado contenida por el estilo de música que está creando. Cuando la ví actuando con Billy Idole me dije, wow, esto si es ella!!!
I like the beat of the song but not feeling it.  Maybe its her being chosen to sing on this or the lyrics i don't know.  Her look is cool but the hair is a bit too much on top. I liked her look few years back when she did a more edgier 80s vibe.   I never liked mileys mouth.  Her veneers is just way too much for the type of mouth she has.  It's honestly all i see when i look at her.
整形しすぎで誰だか分からん😂
Watched it more than 5 times classic ❤
woooooooooooooooooooow ! and that jaw "Ah Ah Ah"...I`m short of words to express my opinon about what i feel about what an artist You are I love you Miley.Greetings from Ukraine !
I’m obsessed with her ughhh!!!!
ТАК СЕБЕ,НА ТРОЕЧКУ.МНЕ НЕ ПОНРАВИЛОСЬ
I wish we could bring back the face and the short hair era cause she looks stunning especially on the Can’t stop and 23 music video
Beautiful song. We need more songs like this. Keep releasing more video songs. ❤️
Best teeth ever.
Miley making a comeback
Finally,Miley is back babies ❤
Soooo where’s Pharrell?? 👀
O pop dessa música ❤
Weak...after the breaking ball this girl haven't been the same anymore...In this song I seen beyonce and lady gaga, the teeth part reminds me about a gay Italian pamphlet show...song short and reperitive...sounds like she had to pull out something commercial to be at the radio listened to.
Oddly enjoyed this. Something i would dance to while trying to get the house work done
love
il video è di un cringe allucinante!
Some parts sound a lot like i wanna be your slave by maneskin x)
Boring 🙄
Bad version of maneskin?
This woman is additcting 🔥🔥🔥
❤
den  er  god
what a load of sheet cant believe i listened to this
❤❤
maneskin is that you?
When I heard her song, I feel sexy hahaha.
Tina Turner swagger a lil bit
Wow. I'd forgotten how beautiful Miley is...
Here's Miley again with an awesome hairstyle 😍
I like Miley. Her music sucks but she made me smile once that’s basically some sort of rape. I love Miley as my abuser it’s her eyes they fucked me up they don’t belong.
Miley has great legs! legs eleven baby!
Is this song really going to be played in the next 10 years… 🙄
I can match Miley in voice and sound but masculine.
Why did………. I wanna be your slave ??? Pop into my head when this song started ? ❤
Miley is looking amazing. Loving this version of her ❤
Nice hit
❤❤❤❤
Where's pharell???
I have waited for pharell  part😂😂weuhh
Love seeing her 😄 songs love
Miley is serving body goals😊
no...thank you.
🙄
Miley is working the Jackie Collins hair big time. 😁
Yep that’s Tina Turner style right there
I love this more and more…health insurance who?!?!
Begining sounds like song by Maneskin.
sanguine queen
❤🎉
Knowing how much Miley grown up as a singer! Wow! You rock,woman! Absolutely love this song,so catchy and you look outstanding!
She looks like she's having fun with this one.
🔥
She cannot dance should've stuck to twerking and I say that very begrudgingly. The beginning is her killing a roach with her heels
Since when do they introduce a song by the producer foh..yall know damn well this clickbait shii had us expecting to see Pharrell😒
Yes Work It Out Miley 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I love this song and Miley is beautiful but I think these dance moves are atrocious
Is this beat just ripped from Maneskin 'I wanna be your slave' ?!
LOVE IT!
Beautiful hair. It really looks good on her. Or is she wearing a wig or extension?
She totally copied Maneskin's song "I wanna be your slave"
Can definitely hear Pharrell in this !! The beat is giving "Blurred Lines" vibes . Nostalgic !!
I love Miley, but she looks so much older than she is.
Love Miley!!! I saw them both on a festival
Hate that hair on her.  It makes her look way older and dated.
love her  energy 🎉🎉 looking so much like her mom.
Gawd! Come on Miley! Style on point!
way better than selenas new single...❤️❤️❤️🤣🤣🤣
On abase level, she wants to (Start a relationship with a reluctant or shy person) On a medium level,  a new member of her inner circle is now on the path of complexity toward her most hidden of secrets. On a higher level, it's about fixing the broken fence with Gunther (Thor's brother)
The dancing is soooo cringe
Where's Pharell???
I have always loved Miley Cyrus and her new sound is so much more sultry and soulful
Barbarella Baby I love IT!
❤
م
M❤
I love her voice … but I wish I hadn’t watched this video — the styling and the choreo… 😬
Cuando está de pu&@ m@^€# no necesitas nada solo tu energía y es más que suficiente ❤❤❤
Great
Esse look é da Thalia mexicana.
❤❤❤
Yasssss I love this! This is so light and fun! You can just see the healthy happiness in Miley! She is so focused on herself and it’s so clear! Also she looks just like her mama! Damn this was so fun and so good! I love to see it!😊😍💜
Not the lyrics cuz both songs are different. But this is giving me Gloria Trevi's, "Dr. Psiquiatra" especially the HAIR! ❤❤❤
Its very Pharell.. love it. ❤
Miley's dancing sucks
me encantó, me encanta ☺️ espetacular. ❤❤
Are my the only one that thinks her teeth are to big for her? I like Miley but damn those chompers😂😂
queeen
Miley ❤ the intro the leg movements work it out❤❤❤
Bravo 🎉❤❤ mujer plena empoderada bendiciones
La hermana perdida de Anahí,LOL.
Bas mi je slatka.Opustena i vidi se da uziva 😊🥰
Pharrell going to get -sued- again man... Leave those ppl beats alone
💯🎵🤗
I love her so much
I see a woman in confidence, winning, and happy with her life! Serving as always! ❤❤❤🌟🌟🌟
Man the rhythm is great
Contagiously ear worm of a song. Great video and costumes. But what’s with her teeth?  I have seen better on horses!  Horrors!  Deal breaker to for a glamorous image!  🤮🤢
So beautiful.  She dances and just has fun  .❤❤
Mileys tongue excessively out for every word kinda unintentionally annoyed me wtf.
Amoo9o
Kinky message for a song 😅
Gives me Tina Turner vibes! 👏👏💜💜
So saddddd
So lame so not creative ugh ugh ugh
Love
Berta's Daily Top 10 Mar. 7, 2024 Top 10 Yesterday: 10 Peak: 10 Days: 4
Where was Pharrell??? I literally only saw Miley…she was like literally the only person in the video and the only voice I could hear. Unless I’m going blind and deaf
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
This song makes me want to vacuum with high heels on!
grown
Something about the way that faux fur coat and Mylie’s hair move in that slow motion fashion scratches my brain in all the right places.
She looks amazing 🥰
Not me waiting for Pharrell to have a verse
I ❤Miley Cyrus’ voice as a grown woman!
Love her!
She lame as hell
😍😍😍😍😍
She look just like her momma now
Intro was stolen from mäneskin
I love Miley's evolution as an artist so much, she's so cool TuT
This is really weird... It's got Blurred Lines sound but Beyonce look and dance. I'm not seeing that, surely?
Tiene un parecido con Anahí de RBD
She's so fucking gorgeous!
The new Donna Summer
Between thisvideo and the performance of Midnight Sky at the VMAs, I wouldn't mind that all her videos are just her playing for the camera in a blank background with lighting as decoration and that's it
I loooove the woman Miley has grown into… Having the time of her life and enjoying the fruits of her labor💕
2024 is the year of Miley living her BEST LIFE! I love it!
This is the best duo I’ve seen. Aside from Gaga and beyonce
Miley giving me Jane Fonda.
Is it me or does her look reminds me of Tina Turner
Girl said this wig is GLUeed down. Turn that fan on!
odeio quando dá close nos dentes dela e sou obrigada a ver essas lentes ao invés daqueles dentinhos tortos icônicos q eu amava
Can this woman please stop trying to be Tina Turner?!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 Yes Miley Yesss
Love the hair everywhere ❤️‍🩹
she's got my attention from her flower song.
https://youtu.be/e0HCWfAyRVg?si=GNupEFTntgWVPJyn Zaouli dance explained
Miley is in her 90’s supermodel era 😆
Is she mad that Beyoncé moved into Country. No one notice but me?
The dance moves are slack, I hate that hand flap 😂 that’s not a move.
O timbre dessa mulher é tudo!
Giving Kylie Minogue vibes
Hiya!
yess girl, u ate this so hard but
Gon' Miley!!  ❤
I C O N I C
❤Miley!!!!2024
Makes me wanna dance! ❤
I love this but don't know why they call it Miley and pharrell when he is never there
Not bad 🤷
I think Miley has been channeling a LOT of Tina Turner lately, and I'm loving it! ❤
Her hair looks like Billy Ray passed down the mullet down the family tree. My hats off to her dentist too for rangling in them teeth. KUDOS!!!
The higher the hair🙌
THIS IS MY QUEEN
Love me some Miley!!
Damn! Loveeee it! Let summer begin 😍
마일리 40대인줄 ㅠ
Que diosa Miley Cyrus ❤😊
I feel like she was enjoying herself in this video song. Fully relaxed..
TINA TURNER VIBES. YESSSS MILEY ❤❤
Clickbait 😮
OMGGG !!! I'M SO IMPRESSED !!! THE QUEEN IS BACK WITH AN AMAZING CHOREOGRAPHY !!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
that was super cool
Is that all her real hair? She looks great.
Maravilhosa ❤❤❤👏👏
Is she on something 🤔   Probably meth
Okay, we got it. Them new veneers... 😬😬😬 no need to keep flaunting them.
sorry, I know people love crazy, out-there stuff but this hair ain’t it
Oh I get it: a bit of Tina Turner, a bit of Amy, a bit of Taylor. But where’s the Miley who belted out Jolene pure and simple?
You did that shit ❤❤❤❤
Not my type of music I prefer midnight sky a billion times to this song however I am glad to see Miley happy and having fun
Not my type of music.  I prefer midnight sky a billion times to this song however I am glad to see Miley happy and having fun and flawless
The beginning of this song does not remind you of the song "Crazy" of Gnarls Barkley? 🤔
I really like this 🤸🏾‍♀️😅
Her wig probably weighs more than her lol
oh my god. vocals
SHE'S AWSOME!!🙃🙃🙃
Her energy
Ew this is trash
Women: We don't want to be sexual objects! The same women show underwear to catch more attention and get more money. Funny
You look amazing, that dress! Reminds me Tina's legs
Jane Fonda!!!
Where's Pharrell? ... However, the song without him Is perfect🎉🎉🎉 I'm falling in love with your músic Honey!
There's a move that looks similar to Gaga's Little Monster moves..
Perfeita!! Come to Brazil
Nah FR , Miley Looks GOODT 😍🔥🔥😍.!! She Betta Work It Out Then 😌🔥😮‍💨🔥.!!
❤❤❤
It reminds me of Maneskin. I wanna be your slave!!!
Even her hair is having a great time!
She looks like her mom
Ok Tina turner vibes
Im starting to like her since her's "Flowers".....
Sucks
Love you, but this hair, uh it’s just not it. Time to hire a new stylist.
Mountain hillbilly smash 😂
Hanna Montana...
She reminds me so much of young Jane Fonda in her work out video days, LOVE IT😍
Hi miley Cyres 13:58
Robin Thicke blurred lines?
It’s giving blurred lines
Loving this! Brought a huge smile to my face. Smiley, you're really coming into your own. X
C'est nul😂
its a real pretty and sexy
She looks so TRASHY…! How old is she?
Her stylist needs her ass whippid firvthat hair
Where is Pharrell?
😍
This is dedicated to all the doctors and nurses. Now y'all have a new anthem for the patients!
Stupid song for stupid people
jeez,... her gums look so inflamed....
I love ya 🎉❤🎉
🔥🔥🔥
Aaaaah me encanta
This song is shit
Hair is ridiculous, the dancing is terrible, the beat is catchy, but the lyrics are lack luster. 2:09 the industry symbol in plain sight. I give this song and video a 2/5 stars because I enjoy the beat.
That fan be working overtime... XD
Shout to Miley for giving thank to the late great Tina Tina Turner
im starting to see the miley we all fell inlove with, ive missed this hair colour on her
Very very cute, I like it the song and Miley has an incredíble voice👏👏👏👏👏❤
Gosh, how has a model agency or perfume line not signed her yet? I think she only gets more beautiful. I dunno if this song was a hit for me, but definitely love seeing her back to Miley. <3
Not bad but not memorable 5 min after it’s done
Just Miley, The Song and The Wall, no need for extravagant music video. Perfect!
Weird how this a Bangerz outtake but the vibe feels like 2009 Miley
....Jane? Jane Fonda? Are really you ????
Song is great, but god damn, I cant take my eyes of Miley, she looks incredible, amazing, hypnotizing, it's unspeakable pleasure to look at her
I love Miley, but this song…..not for me
I dont know why but I really dont like her teeth Nor the way He moves her mouth..😂😂but still she's beautiful Andi I like all her Songs ❤
Wow
so cool, she looks so happy
Grandly
Stronger
Extreme
Divine
Hymn
Glamours
Day by day, she looks like Jane Fonda in Barbarella
Oh my goodness, Miley is truly beautiful!! What a fantastic video, such fun ❤
je l'adore ! j'aime trop ces petites danses et sa joie ! surtout comment elle se moque d'être parfaite
Jane fondA hair
Holy guacamole! "Doctor (Work It Out)" is a superb jam! It has potential to be one of best songs of 2024!
THAT CLASSIC PHARRELL 4 BEATS BEFORE THE DROP ALWASY LETS YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE A BOP
Scam
i love how MIley gives tribute to icons, putting it in a modern form, still being herself and not taking care what others think about her<3
Where's Pharrell Williams..lol
I’m happy Miley is finally getting to live out her auntie era
here if you love this great song by Miley Cyrus
Not keen on this song
I really hope it's synthetic fur, this thing about murdering animals for their fur and moreover this type of fur is cruel!!! inhuman and even primitive because we are already in another era! Many are skinned alive and in pain, even without skin, they are still alive to do that and whoever uses it is cruel, I don't understand what it's worth to be vegan if you kill beings that way... the skin leather at least the animal dies but Even so, they suffer, but in this type of skin, the poor animals suffer a lot. That's the only bad thing about Miley. I hope it's not real skin, but it doesn't say in the information that it's synthetic skin, so apparently it is, as many say, and I know maybe she's not It interests it but it's sad... one's life falls due to one's own actions at some point...and if someone likes this type of fur so much, have a little animal in your house and caress it but don't skin it! The song is very good, Miley looks great, I will only listen to it but the video itself makes me sad for that coat since at one time it was a living being...😥and no one has the right to take the life of a being that their only horrible moment was meeting and being skinned by a horrible being called a human! But hey, what can we do with people who are like zoombies and don't realize reality... locked in their bubble of materialism and superficiality... it's their life but everything is a balance...  #peace #notfurreal #usefauxfur
I feel she is also giving some work out routines.Love it
She's gorgeous ! :O
Miley, please take all of your unreleased songs and put them on an album girl! Like if you agree.
Were you hiding Pharrell???
Free Palastain.
i love your hair
I like Miley, but something about this just isn't working.
❤❤❤❤

I love her armpit damnnn
01:06 what kind of dancing is this🦵🏼
@mileycyrus , i teach , give only 2 Option, fırst Option make other , you cant make other , tren Option 2 , you make the same , no Problem make the Same but make better the Same , benim gibi doktor bulamasın #Ankara #Newyork
Eugh. Really basic lyrics and minimal video though. Quite surprised this is the first song off a new album tbh 😨 I think they’ve overestimated her talent giving her this much creative freedom in a video & song. The 80’s hooker vibes are entertaining in a ‘laughing at her’ kinda way.
0:22 Miley trying to imitate Gaga. She needs to practice a few more years.
Miley is the new thalia
Love this song
Streams on Spotify
TİNA TURNER YOU KNOW WHO IS SHE ?  Çok komik laaaaaa DR.TİNA-TURNER , WHO IS YOUR MIVE TEACHER FİRE HİM , I AM YOUR MOVE TEACHER YET #Ankara #Newyork
Love the Tina turner Vibes. She's killing it.  Does anyone else hear Maneskin "I wanna Be Your Slave". That beat ..... 🤨
Cadê os Brasileiros ??? Quem é BR comenta aqui 😍😎
she is still in her pop girl era
ma canta una cover dei maneskin?
Miley you need to be a Zumba instructor! Have a series on here to follow.
❤love this song so good anever bonger
I like it! I'm ready for this to be released on the radio..❤
Her voice does not match this song. It would sound a lot better if Måneskin did this song instead of Miley Cyrus.
Not about the hair.
delightful wonderful amazing 💕
Making Dolly proud ❤
Simply beautiful x💖
Came from the dentist tiktok telling her to floss 😩😩😩😩
she looks gorgeous  in that dress
Hey is that a new Jane Fonda workout video?
Did Pharrell lost a bet or what?
So catchy
😊😮😢😊😊😊😢😮😊.....😊😮
You ain't no Tina Turner. All that plastic surgery putting years on you Lil Tish
miley cyrus if u are reading this i am free all week
Måneskin inspiración???  Then ... Have something special with måneskin, new song??? ❤🎉
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
OMG i thought that i was getting old being thirty; until i saw miley !!!!!!!!! how the hell did we aged that fast !!!!!
Somehow reminds me of the song "I wanna be your slave" by Maneskin 😄
Wow🤩❤️ this is going to hit hard
Maravilhosa ❤
Linda ❤
Heuuuuu c'est quoi cette coupe de cheveux Miley ? 🤨
I love her, but this one has to be her worst song
I didn't like her "filthy days" but now she has grown into a total Diva
mmmm....no, she is trying too much and she look clamsy.
Bout to fall off my mini stepper 💃🏾
So ! Ms. Doctor I screw me some , and push hard on metal , that need paint spray and some by happy and Pizza by budget then able too , only not high cost, trained by me move and not earn money use ;)
parece un comercial de Pantene XD
Amazing voice!
MILEY DO YOUR GROWN WOMAN!!
Beznadzieja😅
Big tune , love it !! \0/
Thank you for airing this live! :) I have learned a lot from GSN.
Loving the Jane Fonda reincarnation - but where is the bass and drums? bring on the big sound pls…
Ohhh, Yesss,really working out!!!!♥♥♥♥✨✨✨✨
Miley is aging like fine wine, getting better with time ❤❤
Hoochie mama
Did not see or hear Pharrell Williams at all? 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Wait and see for the next one. I like her and Pharell but this song is a bit repetitive and 2012 maybe. 😊
Miley cyrus New Song  2024 New Single
where is pharell #gochelsea
That body...those moves...Honey you are so hot and on fire...Burn the house down Baby !!! ❤
She reminds me always that we need to grow up.
Take the world Darling...you have earned it...loving the vibes in this gem...Go Girl Go !!! ❤
La Miley es mucho voltaje!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Miley never ceases to amaze 🎉❤
I love so much 💗
Love the song,,wooohooo. Also,is it just me or does Miley very much resemble a younger siz to Angelina Jolie,cause dammn..
Es una excelente cantante y muy preciosa, sin duda me encanta MILEY CYRUS. 🙂🥰😍🤩😘😗💚🤍❤❤‍🔥💓🙌👏👏👏👏
Please leave the healthcare workers out of your weird songs 😭
This girl is single handedly bringing music back after the 80s-90s. Great job ❤
Yeah I half Expected Pharrell to Be in here too. Other than that the music was amazing and the energy and the Dancing as well.
Her body is amazing
❤
I love this hair color for her
Her choreography is me in front of the mirror when no one is looking…except I look deranged.
I don't  know but at the grammy's when miley performed she reminded me of a chicken moving around. In this video she also looks like a chicken moving around
Full Single Ladies
Loveee this <3  good energyy  :)
Beautiful❤❤❤✨✨
Beyonce was first to work it out ... but nevermind.
AWESOME.
Yaassss
🇧🇷❤
Her confidence is EVERYTHING! ✨
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Que perfeição ❤❤
Funky fun tunes + Mileys raspy voice = 🔥
She looks SO good
Que pase miley rutina por que se ve increíble 💕😦
Hate it!!! Bring back Miley from bangerz
Very conserning that people may like this. It is not music, is se*ual vulgarity with some bad rythm.   She looks like a MAN agressive and scary.  Who would like that?  I cannot understand it. I love beautiful women but this just gives me a feeling of disgust.   I think Miley Cyrus was a beautiful talented woman.   They procedures they did on her face are CRAZY and made her look scary.   She lost any femininity in her and became absolutely vulgar.   Or maybe its a clone, at this point I would believe anything.
She’s like a female Harry Styles
She is beuatifull,amazing singer and one of a kind entertainer,but sorry.... Song is boring for me 😥
Es como verle a Gloria Trevi
REINA 👑
fck i love it ....
Um..yea no. Bad choreography. Can't be tamed was peak performance
Gnarls Barkley's Crazy and Maneskin's I Wanna Be Your Slave had a child, Kylie Minogue was the godmother, and Miley raised it right. PS: I know Doctor is older than Maneskin's, but you can't ignore the vibes.
Okay hear me out, I feel like this was originally for Britney Spears… am I reaching? Either way Miley sounds amazing on this!
This video reminds me of her Godmother...
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy breakfast lunch dinner 🍰🍨
Hino
Hino
a skeleton with hair, ugly song
Recently I had a really strange experience with my dog. He was silently sitting in front of me for whole hour, while I was meditating and it seemed as he was also involved in my practice. Without saying a word , I mentally asked him “bark once if you are here with me” and he barked imediatly.   Has anyone experienced simmilar thing before? I really want to hear your story I made a video about it on my channel if anyone wants to dive deeper
Where’s Pharrell Williams? Ripped off waited the whole song. 😌
Please stop taking drugs miley
Amazing 😮🤯🤩🤩🤩
ok I admit it! I was NOT a miley Cirus fan, but after Flowers and this song I think she got refined and like her style now.
Love seeing Miley happy😊
She looks incredible.....makes me wanna workout......nearly 😂
I like it❤
what's that thing called when you see thd name Pharrell and hear the beat, you think of "Happy"?
where is the pharrell williams colab ?
Who is her dentist :-)
@mileycyrus , şarkı 🎵 ses ritim falan iyi , yaptığın bir kaç move iyi ama bir kaç move olmamış , görüntü çekimi klip hiç olmamış , saçma sağan bi şey olmuş , be doktor diyorsun , doktor 👩‍⚕️ bi şey göstersen , MARKETİNG DE BİLMİYORLAR , BANA SOR Bİ ŞEY YAPMADAN ÖNCE #Ankara biraz kilo al , tahta 🪵 delik 🕳️ seni
Diosaaaaaa, heterea,poderosa,magnífica, love you giiiiirl !!!
Oye pero,no escuché la voz de Pharrell
I will ALWAYS love Miley Cyrus, and I will absolutely fight about it 😂❤
YES MA'AM!!!!!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
This is dope ❤❤
the dance is like some gymnastic steps😂
MILEY IS HYPNOTIC!!!! I cant stop looking at her.
0:51 a new song starts 😂
Quel changement ! Cela lui vas bcp mieux,  et même la musique 🎶
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾
Love Miley ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Remembers me of Cindy Crawford aerobic sessions
Aggressively throwing that sex appeal at us using a crap song.
So where's pharral❤
What happened to Pharrell?? 😂
This video remind me Single ladies (Beyoncé)
Her first song that is just about fun, and not about ex. her first song she wore decent clothing. Congrats!👏🎉❤️
So many credits, but I just want to know if that dress is a Bob Mackie
I don't know🤔 but I see the Gymm session activation 😂huge fan of both Pharrell and Miley though!!
Look like Tina Turner
Naughty 😊
That "Dum dum dum dum dum" at the beginning is so Pharrell
Getting some major Cher-like vibes from her current era.
❤ excelent
Ummm. Where is Pharrell?! Lol. She is beautiful and talented. I just wish she knew how beautiful she is with or without enlarging her teeth. If she is happy, (obviously she is) then good for her. She has the talent and beauty to pull anything off!!!!
she is such a star 😂❤❤❤
When you read between the lines of flowers… and then hear this song. Are you guys getting it yet? Is it clicking yet?… she’s not fucking over Liam.
She is wearing an underwear :o
okay it's giving Tina Turner vibes. <3
🤔Those look like Laura Clery moves 😆
والله حلوي ياامورا وسطوة ❤😊
What a Jane Fonda Miley!
The black dress looks beautiful on her. But I don't really dig this one.
I love you Miley 😭🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
It didn’t need anything else, just miley 🫶
Crazy fucking girl
where is Pharell?
She’s beautiful in this video❤
Se que es joven pero se ve de 50 años, y ni siquiera cree que sea el look, sino su rostro, sus ojos, su mirada la veo de mayor. Para mi gusto debería engordar un poco, le dara algo de juventud. Aparte esa tonada o ritmo me suena de algún lado, quizás sea de una canción viejita
I danced to it all night and all morning!😅
A smashing hit! I had to dance to your song. Yes, we all need to work it out! Love it!
Que corpo essa linda tem!
I wanna be your slave  I wanna be your master I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoaster  I think it sounds familiar
Pharrell Williams did an amazing job on this track as the, "Invisible Man."
Why is she trying to be Tina Turner,  she hasn't got a chance in Hell?!
so nice miley cyrus full of positive energy
Catchy!
Makes me wanna get up and DANCE!!
Miley please go on 😭😭😭😭
Damm i miss young innocent milley
Not my style but good beat .
She’s so stunning❤
That’s my girl 👍🏾
That voice, those legs, the way she moves…  I like everything about this ❤❤❤
This video is so fun and cute! I have always loved Miley, and this make me love her even more.
Disappointed.
And u said that twice! Haha lemme say that shit again 😂🎉❤
I’m here for it!!
This song is such a vibe, and Miley is giving me Tina Turner vibes in this, I'm living
Lips was drawn right.
Slayed the whole damn game! Never won! Just desserts xo
Achei top mas cade o Pharrell Williams ?
The bit to camera!!
This is a massage to study for my boards
Intro beat very similar to "I remember when I remember when I lost my mindd" anyone?
you can see the strong inspiration behind the song maneskin- i wanna be your slave. Btw Miley looks worse and worse
Visuals are ok! That's all I have to say
Ready to hear that on every radio station
she's so cringe in this era. so much pretentiousness.
She is beautiful... Pharrell beat not him
The beat sounds similar to his happy song
Me waiting for Pharrell’s verse………………………..?…………………….??……………………?…………………. . . . .  .  .
Hey Miley what's good😂😂❤❤❤ Back like never left.
❤❤❤
Pharrel Willíams ??????
Die Zähne🙈
If I wasn't already transfixed by how gorgeous Miley's eyes are, this video did it for me lol. Literally could not stop staring at those peepers. ✨👁
💃💃💃love it💃💃💃
MV ตัวมัม
❤❤❤❤❤
Yep singers these days tries to sell their body to get people to listen their songs. Males too. 2024 body don't sell, voice does. Just saying. Still waiting for Daft Punk 2.0.
A new workout song 🎉
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love it❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤😘😘🥰🥰
Miley gave us 1/10 unreleased smash hits  Doctor Can’t live forever (why wait?) Truly madly deeply Goodbyes and vibrations Night and day Mary Jane Cold blooded Traste of my own F*cked up forever Mirror (better for loving you)  Pleaaaase Miley
Não mãe, nunca foi uma fase. Eu amo essa mulher até hoje.
I can't stop to dancing my body 😢
Nice 🥳🎶💃
Teeths Moments are f. Cringe 😅
What the hell did Pharell have to do with this???
Miley looks beautiful ❤
Hair n makeup wanna give Angelina Jolie vibes
This is what the world needed! None of that rap shit that ruined mainstream music. Bring back pop!
Look I have let I have a Valentine's to make
Pull the green and you'll here it
Live through this
Is the way she single handily carried this video with nothing but herself, 3 outfit changes, and 3 backgrounds!!!!!
It does love you um, she built Marathona before the bypass
looks like you were inspired by Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE... Do somebody hear that?
Mama McCants it was a Jitter Bug it actually Compete they okay f*ck!!! Coaches Coaches
Ai can really make Pharrell look and sound like Miley
Ohhh the best🔥
Bullshit
I think Miley is single handedly bringing back the 80s.
Sexy!
🩵🩵🩵
This is Maneskin I wanna be your slave
Idk why she's been looking like Tina Turner lately with the dresses and the wild hair 😂
Ok your turn... Marty Dread Maui to sing to Tucker
You mean to tell me there was no one on the team to develop a decent dance routine for this song?
Love ❤
I’m not a fan of the song but I will always be a fan of her and how far she’s come.
Video made for 12 year Old audience
God that hair is ugly. All the money in the world and you can’t afford a better hair cut
boring
Idk why but this is definitely giving her God-Mothers vibes and I’m here for it. Welcome back Smiley- Miley 😂❤
Not feeling it
She seems like she's just having a fun time, love that !
❤❤❤
This is catchy af 😅 my mind is already singing “let me work it out”🎵🎶
Miley is in her bliss ❤ 🔥
Legends say Pharrell Williams is still in the video 😅
The long hair is not working for me, her shirt hair is more sophisticated with this look in my opinion.
Why she repeated Grammy outfit?
Awesome❤
This energy is contagious 🤩🙌🏽
The scenes with her shining teeth this close is like a jump scare😳
Her veneers look horrible
Me parece que baila como pollo sin cabeza, pero hay que admitir que la seguridad personal que tiene ahora la hace verse una diosa
Hair and Make-up and director and stylists, Congratulations!!   Y'all ate this project. Absolutely, NO CRUMBS.   And Ms. Miley..... you're doing the damn thAng, lol. Just awesome, truly.   This is such a Cosmopolitan Magazine Francesco Scavullo moment. He was absolutely LEGENDARY! ❤❤❤ RIP.
A good song for a Cha Cha on SYTYCD 😅 Anya & Pasha would kill it on the dance floor
I hate these blurred lines
Esta en su mejor etapa, todo este look le luce mucho
i have a question: why are her videos so cheap lately?
The beat sounds familiar 🤔
Sending my love from South Africa 🇿🇦❤️
She reminds me of Tina turner in that dress 😂
Love seeing you slsy
WHat in the TINA TURNER Is going on here!!??
I love seeing miley so healthy!!!!! 🎉
worst song I’ve ever heard
I didn't heard of Miley Cyrus for years since Hannah Montana 😂😂😂
I love the Maneskin ❤
Song please?
Pharrell and Miley wrote that song  a very long time ago. I love how he added more beats to it. It's a vibe❤❤❤❤❤
where is pharrell wiliams
Halloweening for Crack Head Beyonce meets Tina Turner.
Thats....d the miley cyrus i ws talkinnnhhh abuuu
❤❤❤❤❤✨
remind me of the late Madam Tina Turner..when she sang she looked so free, just like Miley..
What the fuck this song
Not a fan of this one at all, but happy she seems to be enjoying herself!
On dirait Jane Fonda jeune !
Is Miley accoustic?
Nic ciekawego . Przykro mi nie lubie tej piosenki. Jest nudna nijaka
I love you mother
She’s got perfect teeth.
Ispirations in Ray of Light !? ( Madonna) ...🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Fun!
Wow. That was awful...
Manesquin vibes
Pharrell saw her Grammy performance and said we need to do this song I have 💃🏽
I thought Pharrell will gonna come out wearing a doctors costume😂
Are we missing a singer ? lolll
Ok where’s Pharrell 😭😭😭
Pharrell didn’t need to be in the title. lol
She is hot! Werk!
Lemme work it
♥️♥️♥️♥️
I couldn't finish it
The songs great but the video is to much of the same all the way through .also needs Pharrel or some other singer in it as well
You betta werk!
Slay
IM A STAN
Sounds like it was meant to be a Britney song but she couldn’t make it
Шота какая-то постная хуйня в этот раз
Not the standard of song she deserves
Un tema mas al olvido
Icom
Iconn
Oh my goodness like this era is everything!!!
Maneskin called, they want their riff back.😂
I love you Miley but im not loving this new hairdo😢
Pharrels signature intro.
Very expressive indeed.🍤
I’m loving this fun, gorgeous, and wholesome version of Miley. ❤️‍🔥
Shania Twain 💅
one of the worst beats that I ever heard
Somebody tell Miley Tina turner did it better !
❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cringe 😬 lyrics!! Please stop 🛑 JUST STOP
Reincarnation of modern #DollyParton persona
Miley been MILEYN!!!!! She been on her ish! I love her knee vibe and style!
She's at her height now❤❤❤
ihr frisur ist affig  sieht tina turner aus klingt maneskin  is aber Geil
Let's be honest. We were all waiting the whole video to hear Pharell
It sounds like a Pharrell song but I'm  not in love with it :(
Pharrell's part?
Why is she so f***ing beautiful....goodness it hurts. ❤
that massive blue coat thing looks so comfy i want one 😂
ich habe immer mehr das gefühl,  dass Miley Cyrus von den Geist von Tina Turner besessen ist.

Is Miley Cyrus taking concepts from other people now a days. The whole instrumental beat of the flowers song clearly came from Bruno Mars and her entire look in this video is so Tina Turner back in the 70's just Google it especially during a lot of appearances that she did with Cher.
Like and Subscribe guys i wanna feel famous 🎉😂
와따메 뭐 할말핡
Gourgeeessssss
This song sounds like Maneskin's song I wanna be your slave  Here is the song here https://youtu.be/M6ZZKNPrSPw?si=UHfDHWCWknVoguda
Pharrell hiding somewhere in the music video..
Why she look so damn aged
I find her teeth disturbing and don’t like the tune of the song 😖
All pharrell’s beats sound the same and boring nowadays
🔥🔥🔥❤
eating disorder or nah? Not trying to be mean.
مايلي تحزِِن  المخرجون يلعبون بها كالدمية عزيزتي مايلي ارجو ان تلتقطي حريتك محبتك من KSA🤍
Miley is gorgeous
Makes me think Tina Turner!
This is such a lame video sorry 😅
ATEE
I love this, it has Pharrell's funky stamp all over it and Miley's energy and incredible voice is the cherry on top.  I just love her diversity in the kinds of music she can perform effortlessly.  She absolutely nails it every time!
nice song, nice voice but the video should be more creative
Is it just me or is she looking a bit Jane Fonda?
❤
she looks more happy
She’s giving me 90s Shaina vibes, I love this song and style of Miley!
Added to Workout playlist!
I feel that Miley is bringing classic yet modern femininity, bold yet not pushy sexuality, and female energies back into vogue. These energies are bringing about truly fantastic changes throughout the world and in the music industry as well 🙏 She will be the Madonna, Whitney Houston and Tina Turner of the 2020s. Besides, of course, how unique and wonderful his voice is! I LOVE her! 🤩🤩🤩
At first I didn’t really like this song but I have to admit it’s grown on me very quickly
✨✨✨⚡⚡⚡☄️☄️☄️
Why are you so flawless? We are all filthy peasants here.
Perché sti atteggiamenti alla Tina Turner!?abbastanza playback; comunque rimane sempre una delle mie cantanti preferite
Iconoo
She's trying to copy Tina Turner's look but nah it ain't working out.
🥰💕 Xx
Love to see her having so much fun with music these days.
When is Pharell part? Can t find it
Oh my eyes
Wow❤❤❤lamilamilami!!
💩💩
Mamma mia🥹😍
why she looks like a Tina Turner and Jane Fonda at the same time? anyway... this is cool af
Mmmhh been waiting for Pharrell all day long😂😂
Plagiarism
All I hear is “Grove is in the heart”
Tina Turner's vibe
Maneskin? Przegięcie z takim plagiatem...
her Cheek Bones 😮😮 i want to pinch it, squeeze it 😮😮  ok, i have obsession on her cheek bones and jaw line i guess 😮
Tina turner
She looks so much like her mom it's like an exact replication with darker hair beautiful both of them
Was ist mit Ihren Haaren??schrecklich😅
What is she trying to be the next Tina Turner? Give it up
Zero budget for this video 😂😂
Pharrell did the beat lol I was like wait where Pharrell verse??? 😂😂😂
Why does it sound like it can come out of a hannah Montana movie
Am I the only thinking the hair is giving 2013 Artpop Vibes from Gaga?
Beyonce Doing Miley and Miley doing Beyonce
U ovoj haljinici i sa frizurom malo lici na Tinu T. iz ranijih dana.
I actually like this she finally for once seems like she's having a great time 😁
Nice amaizing
I looooove itt!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
masterful pop song and video. nailed both.
is it just me or does Miley seem to be overly tan and it's starting to show signs of aging     She is to young for being a leather face.
Her teeth or facett are too big for her mouth , fortunatly she's a beautiful gorgeous stunning queen with an amazing voice
Is anyone else getting Tina Turner vibes from her style and movements these days?
Well, today Myley’s pants are on 😂
She looks spectacular.
I’m feeling this Miley show the fuck out theennnn🔥🔥🔥
❤
But you wreck the ball
I like her body and dress, but hair ......
Hat was von Beyoncé. XD Aber das Lied an sich gefällt mir nicht. Aber sie ist echt ein Hingucker.
It's a vibe....for sure. Keep working with big bro Pharrell 💪...I'll stay with you frfr. Nice joint❤💯
But its really bad.
❤❤❤❤🎉
The definition of artist
Beautiful goddess ❤❤
The song is so much fun, the video too
Way to go Miley. I Love it! More songs like this is just perfect for you 😊
What a forgettable song
❤❤❤❤❤perfect!!!
Can we give the choreographer a round of applause?  This is giving everything I’ve needed and more
Nice song but video doesn't vibe with d song😮
I just wanted to see her not Pharrel!!
New Age Tina Turner !!
It’s funnier with the sound off
I love
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ann Margaret
Off topic:   Who’s her dentist? 🤌🏻
Lets work it out!
This brings me back to the '70s.
Recordé a la Grandiosa Tina Turner ......peinado , vestido y movimientos similares 😎☺️
Hhauuu
Klo di sini doi pen jadi MANTRI kali yamaksdnya
I love her but I do not care for this or the video , but get you some Miley
where is Pharrell Williams?????????
Cuando la escuche por primera vez se me afiguro a la cancion de meghan trainor la de mee tou
It's so beautiful to see Miley having fun, working some shit out!! Who knew Miley and Pharrell was magic we never knew we needed!!!
Damn
I'm glad they hold onto this one for 12 years, She needed to be older to do this song justice. It wouldn't have the same effect if she were in her early 20s. This is a song for a woman, not a girl.
donde esta pharrel willliams?
Am I the only one that was waiting for Pharrell verse?😭😂😂
Love💗 Love💗 Love 💗this.. the dress👗, earrings💎 the blue shimmery coat 🧥is Freaking Fantastic, I would wear this in a heartbeat. Way to go Miley. Oh and the Hair is to die for.
Her teeth are so white 😮
MOTHER JUST MOTHERING
That’s my mother right there
Su abrigo es de plumas??
That mouth up close got me thinking of Kiley Minogue
Is that her real teeth, cause I’m a lil jealous 😂
Love all but her hair style 😢 is just a little rare 😅
❤❤❤
Where’s Pharrell? 🤧🥲
Never thought I'd like a Miley Cyrus song but the girl is making classics
This is so goodddd
Totally Tina Turner 😍🥰😍
I love this era of Miley!
uau...q serie de ep emocionante.... mais real .....incrivel!
Who else wants @Miley Cyrus as their workout partner?
Esas mujeres parecen locas
Everybody always comparing...  🤪 Miley I like it... Get it guRl!! ❤
사상의 배설물 #민주당해산
Where is Pharell in this video?
Would be nice to see Miley be herself - for once... Instead of always trying to copy other classic music artists (Madonna, Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, Stevie Nicks, Debbie Harry, Cher, Tina Tuner, Billy Idol, Bruno Mars, Beyoncé, etc). I mean, everything (style, hair, camera angles, dance moves, music & lyrics) she does belongs to someone else. It's like enough already!
Just a little choreo would've enhanced this clip - i know she did her own thing but eh... this said ft Pharell, where's his genius  on this track? Hmmm.. ok we get it, Miley is feeling sexy and fit and wants to celebrate it. Good for you. But didn't do much for me. Maybe if i was 26 and not 40 lol 😂
❤❤❤
ts so ass 😭😭😭💔
I was never a Miley Cyrus fan until flowers. I like this song because it's so Miley. I think her music is going in the right direction. I felt her earlier music was geared to younger listeners and not to my liking. These last 2 songs are closing the gap between the 2. If she  continues she will be more popular than ever. She is a very talented and beautiful young lady.
❤❤ i love work it out..
Beautiful 😻❤️❤️❤️
Hey Miley! What do you do when it doesn't work out? You work it back in! LMFAO I love you
It’s giving Hannah Montana and I live 😊
Is it just me or is the music a mash up between Blurred Lines and Happy👀
Great job from Miley and Pharrell Williams, the cameraman
Maneskin
Show them veneers girl. You paid for them. 💅💅💅
Copy Tina Turner look. I like it when she's herself no need to copy
sorry, but NO пошлятина
The song is okay, its not that great... but SHE MADE THIS SONG HER B*tch , lol . HER VIBE AND HER ENERGY AND HER LOOK AND HER AMAZING PHYSIQUE! IS FIRE!!!
Beautiful
I’m here from a tiktok video where a dentist is saying Miley has puffy gums 😭😭😭
Hana Montana chỉ mới sinh năm 1992 tên thường gọi là Bạch Tuyết Anna. Được đơn cử lần nhiều đến khán giả hâm mộ, từ giám đốc sở Nam Em. Là một ca sĩ được tôi luyện khắc nghiệt, là một ca sĩ thực lực.
Imitacion mediocre de Tina Tuner
Her moves look really forced
I love watching her
I love you Miley❤ happy to see you happy
Diosa 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 🎉
Go miley 🎉🎉🎉
She's channelling Tina Turner (dancing) and Dolly Parton (hair) with a Pussycat Dolls outfit!
Bad copy, Måneskin was way better
I love Miley Cyrus she's awesome
It looks like Tina Turner so not original
Shes finding herself in the music industry and thats ok, shes found her calling ❤ lets be happy for her 🎉🎉
Oh my god, she's killing it AGAIN!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Berta's Daily Top 10 Mar. 6, 2024 Top 10 Yesterday: 10 Peak: 10 Days: 3
Tina Turner vibes
Wow. Not one single negative comment. Hmm. Seems fishy. Let's see if I find my comment tomorrow.  This is one of those videos that makes me think that if you already have enough money you can release anything and people will think it's good because of who you are and not the actual talent exuded in said video. I'm not saying Miley isn't talented at all. I'm just saying this song and video seems a little spastic and her jaws are sunk in. It reminds me of Amy Winehouse.
María Mercedes pa servirle a UD.
❤❤❤❤❤
Miley is THAT girl!! Video is 🔥🔥
Miley looks amazing in this!!!
She looks like Tina Turner
Bet her ex hubs is like …. damn 😳
She looks fabulous - except for the trashy tattoos that make her look like a doodle pad.
🔥🔥🔥
Se convirtió en toda una diva 🔥
is she allright?
I was never a Miley fan, but I do like the vibe of this song. It's giving sultry, grown woman and I'm here for it.
Jajaja y no que era flowers 2.0 jajajaja ni los 10 millones llega
❤
Love it
Either you like Miley or you don't. But I remember a couple of years ago people were calling her trash and untalented. Comparing her butt to a piece of chicken on meme's. But now y'all love her? Now she's the greatest? Humans can be very annoying. You love people one minute and hate them the next. Kudos to Miley.
A little maneskin... even the lyrics
Ben shapiro rappikg was better
i hear sometyms mehgan trainor hymm
🔥🔥💯💯 Yass Girl Slay
I love you Miley 😘 keep it up baby ❤️
Cringy
Thalía and Laura Leon Realness ❤❤❤❤
I am absolutely HERE for this version of Miley yassss!
Queen always
She reminds me of a young Jane Fonda. ♥
ALLLLRIGHTYYYY THEN MS.MILEY
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Whitney Houston + Mariah Carey + Lady Gaga   = Miley Cyrus.  MASTERPIECE✨
The retro era back ❤😊
"i can't be tammed" hair-do is back😂
Not me waiting for Pharrell
Is this the iconic dress from the Grammy Awards
Loved it ! So,  happy that this artist is back 🎉🚀
She's morphing into a young Jane Fonda.
All I can think of is that she will have very dry eyes after filming this...
MILEY IS BACK BABY
You look like a cross of Dolly Parton and Tina Turner. I love it. 🔥🖤
Love her. This song is trash.
She's gorgeous, and with a gorgeous voice, but I would have loved this more with more of her humour, like cute little doctor's outfits and taking her hair down a titch. No denying she's stunning though and has come into her own.
Like Lady GaGa
Miley Cryus is a great singer with her albums
I don’t mind a different look. But copying Tina Turner moves and dress and doing circa  1984 BIG hair isn’t original , no matter how good you look physically.
This has more views than cardi’s new trash ass song and it’s in #7 trending. If that doesn’t scream payola idk what does
The principal sound for myself is similar to the song of the Maneskin - I wanna be your slave
Gloria Trevi
❤Awww, that was so beautiful❤🙌🏽💐🌹
Miley is possessed by tina turner 😮
Salut la teams bienvenue dans la playlistes 💕 furtif 💕 force honneur et loyauté 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Good song still waiting for Pharrel to sing
the way she's still SERVING with the simple backgrounds.. even that doesn't matter bcus the song is FUN AND SHES HAVING FUN. she looks so happy😭
I loved it❤❤❤❤
Yep! This is going to be my N°1 summer hit this year 🎉❤ love it
Very good body❤
No me gustó 😢
Reina
La amo ❤😊
She has never looked or sounded better!! 🌶️🤍
❤❤❤❤❤❤
You go girl!
I love Miley!!! Every girls got a Drag Queen in their closet these days! Work it out!!! 😁
♥️♥️♥️
This is a disgrace to music. That's my opinion. Who thinks this is music, is delusional.  That's also my opinion
♐️♐️♐️♐️♐️♐️
This is everything
Looks like a young Jane Fonda ❤
Where is Pharrell Williams 😢❤
Director: Uhh Miley, we got 100 dollars for this music video. You got any ideas that could save a few bucks?  Miley: I can get a few outfits from the thrift shop.  Director: Cool! We'll film you with a bland background splicing in all three outfits, and now and then we'll cut to an extreme close up of your mouth.   Miley: Okay, I better brush my teeth.
Pretty funky and it's a party starter
I love you sooo much lol (:
❤❤❤
She just having fun, I love her sooo much.
Yeah she's awesome, boring song.
https://youtu.be/ybcQI7Ov2eY?si=MMMfPQUhu3f4yQEi Perfect Instrumental to sing doctor ❤❤
Stop it. RIP TINA
🔥🔥🔥🧯
Hueona qué temazo 😮‍💨🫶🏻🔥
Why is she lip singing for the music video 😂😂
♥ shine ♥
Where is Pharrell Williams?
Actually, thats a great video❤
her idol is Dolly Parton
She looks absolutely beautiful here
I love this Miley
She should get a choreography in if she’s going to “dance” about in her videos. 🙈
She still does nothing for me. Even with Pharrel
❤
We need a doctor with this one !  🗣️
I love this woman vibe 😍 she sing so well and is sooo pretty 💚
Why does she look way older then she is and her dancing has gone down hill... I enjoy her music but her last few appearance video looks and dancing where horrible and she looked like she was trying to be Tina Turner at 50 yrs old but it did not work she looked as my mom use to say "worked hard put away wet and not cared for"... I hope she finds her joy again when she is happy it shows in her looks music and dance
Maravilhosa
If Tina Turner, Beyonce's "put a ring on it" video and Billy Ray Cyrus's 90s hairstyle got together and had a baby...
Linda
Love Miley Cyrus
Only those artists that can’t really sign should do a song like this🥺
Che cancion fea! Ella fue d esas q solo tienen un hit mundial y fue todo!
I'm totally loving this new Miley. So full of life and energy. She has grown a lot over the years and this is so far the best version of her,.. for me at least 😘😘❤️❤️❤️
This reminds me completely of beyonce song and video called work it out.
Tina turner comeback ❤
I wonder when will she have a tour again? If she does I'd be happy to go since I never been to her concerts yet kinda sad never got a chance to
I LOVE HER VOICE🥰
Where is Pharrell Williams? 😅
Miley come the fuck thru🔥🔥🔥
I love Miley❤🥰☺️
See folks. This is the glow up from leaving shitty relationships behind 😏
Those tattoos are terrible. It looks like the doodles i used to draw on my books at school, lol
10M C'MON GUYSSSS
BEYONCE ALREADY DID A SONG work it put Austin powers 😮
Where did she get this song from? Is it from the “Endless Summer Vacation" or  new album come? I don’t know, but I like this song. However, I think most people will consider it a generic song. Perhaps I am wrong. Let’s see !
This is pretty 🔥
🌞👑
Sou o comentário brasileiro que você procura
Glad those two linked back together on a song. They mesh.
Miley looks sexy, fresh, classy. I love her style here. I love how she has grown as an artist. ❤
and where is Pharrell?😮
❤❤❤
Waiting Pharrell singing his verse🙃🙃
Very maneskin
❤❤❤❤
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
💋❤️❤️💕💕
no
Woo hoo u go girl get em 🔥🔥🔥
It’s giving… 1.  Night Nurse -Gregory Isaac’s  2. Beyoncé “Work it out” (The Neptunes) 3. Tina Turner aesthetic
bad song. Miley looks good thu
Maybe she want to date the guy from Maneskin 😉
The Glam Grammy look is everything
You do you with the vid, but I do love the song.
I love this new age of Miley. Bring on the grown-up vibes.
Finally a good music ❤
Sounds like maneskin?? But this slays 🔥
Wooow 😍😍 just absolutely gorgeous!!! And at 0:39 she’s giving model hands down!! Surprised the side profile wasn’t the thumbnail. Cuz it’s very Italian vogue worthy.
❤🇧🇷
Miley is more beautiful than ever, but the songs are getting worse...
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥👌🏽👌🏽🎶🎶
wow wtf is this trash!!
Supera...expectativassss eres solo tu
10M is coming
looooove it... this is also has a churchy twist to it... I love it
Where’s Pharrell 🤔
THE BEST MILEY THE BEST SEXY CAT
When we thought it was impossible, she leveled up again!   Miley Cyrus continues to surprise us with her latest music video, showcasing her incredible talent and creativity. Truly, she knows no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope and reinventing her art.
Is it just me but I don't like it
Garbage... music these days is mostly straight 🗑
Es un no parar de escucharlo,cuando me levanto cuando me acuesto,temazo
Looking good!
Misses background dancing chewing gums and toothpaste packets, for my taste. Bit flat like this.
queen of my heart❤
la flaca tiene su cuerpito !!!
I LOVE this era of Miley! ❤❤❤ She looks healthy and happy. The beat is very catchy. Miley looks great. Love the plain, non fussy backgrounds with her sparkly dresses and big hair. It all just works. Kudos to the visionary for putting this together ✨✨✨
Can we please move on from the corpse faces. All these women look the same... and not in a good way.
She literally get out of the Grammys and record the video. Yes, girl.
Little dinosaur ❤
Miley is Queen
We need a remix!! But I'm loving this hair and look on her lately 😍 🔥
I need her workout routine now lol
Body ody ody!!
Hinoo
Queen 🔥
Looks like a minty chewing gum commercial
Vamos subir a música
Miley
You know it's AI because the real Miley Cyrus would have said: "I want to 'twerk it out'!
LOVE LOVE LOVE ✨💕💕💕💕🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Miley cyrus ❤❤❤
Wow her joy is so genuine!!! We love to see it   Also she needs to drop her diet + fitness routine because her body goes insane
Good job Miley ❤️
Cadê os brasileiros que amam a Miley
Love ❤
Hinoo
I don't know much about her I thought she was a country singer I know she was a kid star but she seems to sing every genre in category of songs
No Pharrel No Like
The music video is everything, and her voice is unique, she’s looking gorgeous
This song is from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOb9Xaug35M; Cool beans, Pharrell and Miley just steal other people's work
Jane Fonda vibes
Cmon Miley!!! You betta work it out!!!❤
Boring
Awful
Her arms alone is giving Tina ❤❤
One of her best MV in my opinion🔥 I love love the energy, the hair, the simplicity but yet extravagant style. 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Love it ❤❤
She's so gorgeous, and this song is art definitely
Mid. .. But I'm still a big fan
Anai de rbd, y Miley se parecen un poco😅
Måneskin!!!!!!
i would have enjoyed This song If I had a very  low IQ
Ok
🎉🎉
Effortlessly Gorgeous
Sounds like Maneskin actually.
Overwhelming lyrics 👍 and joyful music . You’re the best 👍
Doctors make things worse.
She made this one for tik tok
Video brilliant❤
Maneskin vibes? 🙃
She is dancing like wednesday😅
Tina Turner
The lines between this baseline and others are a little blurry
That's the perfect Song for her ! I love it !!
She's on fire and she's gorgeous
i feel like working it out
She looks very mature ❤
Read the song title and this is exactly what I thought it would be. Love it ❤
Wow!!
video low cost
I See Miley and can’t wait to get hot 30 🩷
This video is amazing. xxxxxxxxxxxx
Miley has a good face structure made for good modeling shoots ❤
Esto va a ser un verdadero pepinazo!!!
It reminds me the song from maneskin “I wanna be your slave”
This is sounds a bit like maneskin I wanna be your slave. I love it doe ❤
*So is this a tribute to Beyonce's Work it Out video?*
It's interesting when you shift from dad's style to mom's style. It shows in her music and style as well.
well ill be damned if this isnt a big ball of fun
I like her but girl can't dance ... needs something not slow mo ?  and where's Pharell??
Her body though❤️❤️❤️❤️
Alguem do Brasil. Dá um joinha
Pharrell Williams name for click bait? He not in the video  maybe he produced it ?
i hate her haircut
And God created woman
It’s giving not renaissance 😂😩 but okay
Querían recrear lo de los grammy y no se pudo.
Doutora Miley cuidará disso!
Love how she's bringing back the big 80's hair
Nice songs, Miley looks great and oh my dear, those teeth are just beautiful, certainly not Turkey teeth but what part of the song goes to Pharrell? 😂😂did he provide the walls she is surrounded with? One negative- what happens to lyrics being little more than three sentences on repeat, Miley!!! U can do more than that, u have done more than that 😊
Love it ❤
She looks great but the song isn’t as strong as her former ones.
Please stop tryna dance miley 😩
She LOOKS FABULOUS!!!!
The best
The sexiest music video 🔥
Her VERY BEST song so far
Für mich eine sehr unattraktive Frau. Ich glaube sie ist psychisch nicht stabil! Meine Meinung, kein haet!!
is the song sounds like ı wanna be your slave or  is it just me
Where is Pharrell Willams in this song? 👀
Miley has one of the worst voices in the music industry. Was Disney deaf years ago when they signed on that wild cat. It is like a cat hissing. It seems very strained. I don't know much about music, but I wouldn't be surprised if her voice breaks, like Stevie Nicks. Her sister seems to have a beautiful, clear voice.
This is by faaaaar THE miley we waant 😍😍😍😍
She is stunning ❤
Love the groovy vibe <3, great song!! <3
MEGA STAR ⭐️
Perfect! I love it! work me out!
She seems so happy .. I love This her …
Unfortunately it does sound like I Want to Be Your Slave by Måneskin.. 🤦🏽‍♀️.. I hate this for Miley.. Great video and vocals.. The music allegedly does not sound original.. Maybe Pharrell has rights to use🤷🏽‍♀️
It’s giving Sheryl Crow and we live
living for this outfit !!!!
que tosco!
Giving me bangerz vibes
Why does youtube disable the likes on this - Miley Cyrus is rock n roll 4ever love u mama
Shit song. Sorry 😢
How many times do I brush my teeth till they become that white
Where’s pharrel Williams in this music video
❤❤❤
https://youtu.be/L1Pn3RovIqM?si=EP34K3UCZ8ko_ie_
me as a nurse..❤
Makenskin from stolen!!! Shame!!! And that fake teeth 😂 really a good doctor is needed!
When Miley says I Can be your doctor and watching her mouth so close I think at my dentist. Anyway this pice sounds' make me fill thinking "I want to bé your slave" of Maneskin
Que voz tan hermosaaaaa
Looking for Pharrell lyin ass
Its giving come and get it bae
Awesome song!
🤢 🤢 🤢
kylie minnow vibes, i Love it ❤
SIMPLEMENTE HERMOSA!!!
she's so iconic
wtf is this lmao
She makes me want to work out and then *bowl of chips* lol😂
Una mezcla de tina y Beyoncé
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Not me waiting for Pharrell to have a verse😭😂
There is a little bit of Miley's melody in this Maneskin song 😉
Oh God! Even Miley has aged. Where has all my life gone?
Love the fact that she's all natural. No fake boobs, no fake BBL, no fake lips. Its all real and it's all good!!l😊
Tina Turner vibes for sure. Awesome. 🤩
I want this dress❤
Розкішна ❤❤❤
repetition
What a body beside her singing and expression🤟💥✨️
pls change the hairstyle, makes her look much older
I think She's the new Tina Turner
Free Palestine🇵🇸
🤠
No es bailarina tiene una belleza diferente. Peeeeero cómo brilla,no puedes parar de mirarla! Y solamente es ella y su resplandor! Que belleza.
Queen🎉❤
The best ❤
She looks so much like her mama!!
is that bob mackie again i live
Miley don’t give 2 phucks and I’m here for it 👏🏾🔥
boring song ! feel like her last hit will be Flowers and we will never hear of her again
Absolut Trash 😂
He should not be in the title of he doesn't sing.
She had too much fun😂 and where is farrel 😅
As a nurse myself, believe me you couldn't be a nurse.
Cheap and vulgar. It is unfortunate to see many artists engaging in this type of song that promotes a one-night relationship and getting lost in the black hole of pleasure. This is unfortunate. Feelings no longer have value.
I loveeeeed 😍
Reminds me of something Shania Twain would do, for some reason!
I'm sorry, I am not about that hair/ I know the 80's is coming back but....nope.
Miley looks beautiful and happy. Love this upbeat sexy song
Seems like an respond on Maneskin - I wanna be your slave
Its godo this music i love it
Did she film this right before the awards thing?
On dirait Jane Fonda dans Barbarella !♥️🐈
Whatever Miley doing these days is working and I LOVE it! (side note: I want a duet of this very song with Adam Lambert. I think it'd be fantastic.)
i can already see doctors and nurses using this for there tiktoks 💀
I love this woman 🥰
❤❤❤❤
Even though I'm Saudi... her voice is perfect for Texas songs❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love this, sounds like a 2000s popsong!!
I’ve never seen her look more free or happier.
Miley knows how to entertain me.❤
❤
Better not split em legs too far open.. ain't no tellin whata fall out😅.. just a big open hole.. she's not classy
She’s an underrated beauty❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Still kind of sounds like Marvin Gaye!😂
Me encanta ❤
Super encantadora
I think she walked into a spiderweb. Oh, wait that's "dancing"
Un air de blurred lines.
Not feeling this one.. it sounds copied from another song
Miley is serving Tina Turner vibes❤️❤️❤️
Work it out . ❤❤❤
Miley's never looked better🔥
its so f*n' bad ang getting worse
Boring song
I fricken love this song ! Another great hit !😍🤩
Like Tina Turner
I lowkey love this song and I am not into this type of music.
❤❤❤❤
Conheci o trabalho da Miley em 2020 com o album Plastic Hearts e virei fã
Bella 😘😘
Not a fan of this song but appreciate her experimentation
Fine wine
She never disappoints ❤
Maneskin song line…everything ia copy -paste 😢
A music video that breathes life into a song and paints a new realm before your eyes, akin to an enchanting journey through a world of colors and energie🦋
👸🏻Queen! Perfect! 💗❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
This song sucks...
Nice Vibe , beautiful woman, wonderful lyrics I got the vibes I'm shaking my a**** 😂😂😂 👍🏻 love it so much The mood is awesome 😎
She always come thru❤❤❤❤
Ridi
Faye Dunaway
The dance is so infectious, she manages to captivate with just a plain white background, such a talented superstar ❤
She looks amazing
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MILEY <3
❤❤❤❤
Que bella se ve😍
= Maneskin😂
roseixovere

❤
🎉
G.O.A.T.
Miley should change her name to tina turner now 😂
https://youtu.be/b6vcyJPZzgA?feature=shared  Nice Song...❤❤❤❤
Her releasing this in time for Match day is iconic
Muy buen ritmo!! Cualquier estilo lo hace suyo !!❤
she looks like she`s 60 YO
This is her era<3
FIREEEEEEEEE
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Miley is amazing but the recent puff hairstyle is not growing on me at all.😢😂😂
Miley in her Tina Turner Era !!! ❤
Dances like Mick Jagger, with his own steps
Y pharrel ?
she rock
definitivamente está en su mejor momento! estas hermosa miley😍
This is definitely a grower
this is perfection. for so many reasons. Pharell was both the best of and the worst of sweetener so I've just been waiting for him to come back through with another banger pop production. And it made me realize this is how it should be - when a producer is as integral to the song as the performer, we should have them credited. Obviously this happens already esp in the edm genre but it's high time that with as much access to information as we have, we recognize that performers are not the end all, be all of an artistic creation. this puts less pressure on them via the madness that is "celebrity" (think Doja, Britney, Gaga, so many others), and shifts the attention to other collaborators.   I hope this makes sense (: I know it seems silly to care so much about "the future of pop" but it is so deeply integral to our collective consciousness whether we notice it or not. so ofc I'm always so delighted when talent like this hits trending, it shows how versatile and powerful pop is 🥰
ok, so we found someone who dances like Dua did at the beginning of her career. Yikes.
lol Miley's teeth were the paid actress in this one. wow. those things are perfect.
Thrill me out😅😅😅
she said, lemme continue being iconic
Ok then Miley. This is a bop.
Stunning!
queen
❤❤❤
ICON
THIS IS THE VERSION OF MILEY WE ALWAYS WANTED!!!! THIS ERA IS PERFECT!!! SHE JUST LOOKS HAPPY AND HAVING FUN!!!! GO HEAD MILEY!!!! #WORKITOUT
Good song!
Not the worst thing I heard from her still not good
🔥💃💃💃🔥
Not a fan of the song or video, but loving the Jane Fonda vibes.
Send help… I thought the thumbnail was Paula Abdul 🥴😂
🎉
uma mistura de triler do m.j com o screan and shout da b.s
Miley looks good in this style
LMAO
She just looks amazing!!! Healthy, happy, and just loving life!! This is definitely her era!!!
Shes stunning just the hair is a no go for me
This Era from flowers to this. This is MEGA FAVORITE ERA of Miley since Hannah Montana ❤❤❤
Ame❤
She looks and sounds stunning, bit the song is a bit mediocre.
I love this song
Te amo ❤, estás brillando 🎉
I just can´t stop thinking in Tina Turner....

Where is Pharrell?😂😂😂
I love how happy she seems here❤
Esta mejor que nunca impecable
Love this! ❤
Nothing... i feel nothing... something is doing me wrong in this song... It's not Miley... I know how she loves switching her style and that's ok but this one, this style i don't know there is something wrong. There is something different in her eyes... I got the same feeling during the Grammy's...
So much fun .. she’s a Boos
Miley looks beautiful
Love it !!!
It’s a no for me , the hair is way to big , it’s giving Tina Turner without Tina and Turner lol
Miley Used Aunt Dolly's Shampoo again?
She looks creepy like her teeth are to big for her mouth.
You look amazing #selfdreamers inspired
❤❤❤
LOve that Dolly hair!!! Get it Girl!!!
River has a similar vibe to this.
Your hair ate
Beyonce se cruzó con Ariana grande
Her voice is manly 😂
WE PREFER THE PREVIOUS TEETH
Love it! Miley at her best...❤❤❤
The song starts like Maneskin - l wanna be your slave, then switches to Uptown Funk, then couple more very well known hits and back to Maneskin and Uptown Funk.
She is having so much fun!
Nice body❤
Is this country music beyonce is better am just saying
Tina Turner energy with that dress and the big hair ❤
My fav artist of all time and I am older than her :)) So proud of her journey and this clip shows that the real artists dont need neither dancers nor crazy locations to shoot their clips. Just their unique voice and energy! Best of all! Go Miley!
Hot body damned.... ure sexy women.... weloveumiley
This song sux but I like Miley anyway.
Pharell WILLIAMS good vibes  ! She's funny, I like that in the Light !!  But in the background, I hope she has a really sane good, healthy life...Cause one day, her body and lifestyle will tell the thruth ! She makes me think to Madonna few decades ago ❤❤
Fun fact: This song was made 12 years ago and was intented to be on the Bangerz album.
Lemme lemme
Bop
That was a great Plymouth Laser commercial.
Got it on replay ❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No matter what some said after the grammys, she rocks this  hair
I love it 👏👏👏👏👏but that sounds  like maneskin i wanna be your slave
Yassss MILEY!!!! GET IT BISH!!!!! I’m with the self love, old soul feel hunti!!?❤❤❤❤
Whaaaaaaat
Майли, прям современная Тина Тёрнер😍🔥
Something about her face is weird…. Like different.
😍😍😍
The video full of happiness 💃🏻🕺🏻👯 everyone 😅😅
Banger 🔥💃🏻
She looks legendary! This is definitely her best time!
So nice song Miley Cyrus we love u here in Morocco hope you will visit our weird and lovely county Morocco 🇲🇦
Her body is🔥🔥🔥🔥
all those tattoos make her arms look dirty.
Pharell and his signature count
I wish she woukd stop trying to dance...it is weird
Love this!!
I can’t get with the hair lol
Why does she look 40 years old here ?
Phoenix/ A.R. (Not a gun) real Williams   Sort of but not really… or people will misunderstand it.  Phoenix was an attempt on my life in 1992 to cover up Phoenix operation in 1986, albino rhinoceros is what the Sioux tribe called me, real because people keep asking if I’m real, Williams because of the character ash Williams. Connie Williams would be the eyes on me they used.
Okay Miley girl I know you lien”work that out I can be a doctor a nurse anything period let me work you out this different let lil momma work you out ha😂😂😂😂
So Pharrell is not going to show or sing nothing ? Just the beat?😂 I would have loved that
Another hit
Lady Gaga looks young here 👀
Vamos subir ❤😮
Linda nossa Miley Cyrus
Te amo rainha
Love Miley
Maravilhosa ❤
Hino❤
Hino
What happened to all the great musicians from the 50's Doo Wop to the 90's grunge !! What is this called ? It's not what I remember to be music !! YUCK
I give this song a negative 10 on a scale of +10 being best !! Horrible
Song sucks
the hairr
So what if Pharrell has produced it? Many people are producers and don't stand in the performer's name and song title.
Something doesn’t quite 🤔connect here for me. But I am happy she is trying new things.
Love this new era of hers
Miley Cyrus is beautiful 🤩
Looks like Tina Turner 😊
This is how you treat your body, no ozempic no fillers no botox. Justi cardio and pilates. Rocl on Miley 😊
This Diana Ross- spring era is just what we need
why everyone is looking 60 years old these days???
Through this decade i was thinking Is Miley get clowned ??
❤mileys hair styles and wiw her fugure is phenomenal
It feels very Beyonce coded and I'm here for it!
I'm lovin it all! She is a great artist!!
I lime this song, her hair and costumes are giving!! Miley, is in her season and its nice!!
I love her voice, but her teeth and face are looking weird.  It doesn’t look natural. It’s distracting.
Could have taught her some simple dance moves..
What a great toothpaste commercial. I can't wait for the for the next masterpiece "I can be your realtor and you can sell my house"
Someone give her a burger
❤❤❤❤miley
Lately i can't tell whether she is Tina Turner or Dolly Patton she is muffing 😂😂😂😂
She really is shining
I love Miley forever!!!!!!

JLo needs to be on this

I love Miley’s new look!
So Pharrell.  Love this song already
MUITO DIVA
🧡🧡🧡
💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s so amazing.
The dolly vibes thrown into her own  ❤
Defo prefer her rock'n'roll side. She should collaborate with big trash metal bands.
The outfit and hair is giving me Tina Turner vibes.
I love it.❤❤❤
90's kid era is back to the game.... :) Love her energy once again.
Pang pageant to, pwede pang swimsuit competition
Does anyone hear a little of the blurred lines beat in the song?
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Entertaining video, boringass song.
Miley's new song!
So iconic❤❤
Miley has finally come into her own. Her voice is like an unstoppable weapon. Slaying big time
Badass
She looks sooooo much like her mother! She is so damn beautiful geeeezzzzz
This is so Pharrell!
Love it! Miley has always been so talented and so unique. She rocks.❤❤❤
She looks like Shania Twain...
Dam right..... slayyyyyy x 100000000000
Why does it say Pharrell Williams 😅
Like Tina Turner, i love
Who wouldn’t want to let lil momma work it out 😂
MEEH! 🤨
🎵🎤 Groove to the beats of Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus in the "Doctor (Work It Out)"  A musical collaboration that's sure to get you moving. 🕺💃
That hair.
The start sounds like Maneskin 😅
This is like a comercial
Where's Pharrell's voice? 😂  She looks so much more mature now. Sizzling body like Shania Twain and Tina Turner's big hair and attire.  I like this new Miley! ❤
solo quiero ver una pelicula en la que salga ella
Reminds me Maneskin
Blagh
i cant unhear the manaskin melody
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my god here's another  beautiful,great song from  Miley Cyrus wow
It’s a no from me dawg.
TINA TURNER VIBES ❤❤❤❤
Craving for attention all the time.Not normal.
A good song is a good song. And this is a good song.
Woah - Looking fucking incredible damn!
Where is Pharell Williams?
The energy
!
Her hair is a balloon that needs popping
not gonna lie she looks like a major druggo. Hate me if you want but I don't lie.
Lil Miley 🙌🏽
The lyrics are so mediocre.. I only found the bridge catchy. Meh. Not a fan. Plus the instrumental is very boring sonically. Honestly Miley has done better than this. Her voice is great but everything else leaves me completely unexcited and borderline bored.
Who else waited for Pharrelll?
Miley is killing it!! I love seeing her this happy. I was cheesing watching her at the Grammys.
I thought they were covering 'I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE'. But the lyrics are different and melody is Pharrell world, it's just 😂interesting.
You look great Miley❤🎉❤
I absolutely love this! 🤩💕💕🫶🏾
❤❤❤
Ok hair and body! It only made sense to have Pharrell’s produce this! Such a fun song
Iconic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She just went and brought again ❤❤❤ you better work girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Is that another Grammy I see miley?
Icooon
304 anthems album building up steadily.... Bubble still active
Sin duda , la evolución de esta chica es digno de investigar, paso de chica Disney a chica mala y ahora a chica de los años 80s 😂😂
So glad pharrel and miley collabed again they made such a good pair when they made the song come get it bae ❤
Sounds better on ×2 speed.
She is so perfect ❤
I took my little sister to the "Best of Both Worlds" tour. She cried when she found out we were going. Years later she could care less we went and to me it's a badge of honor 😂
No.1 song for 2024!
her character development just amazing
She’s everything
Miley looks so damn sexy!!! ❤❤❤
She looks and sounds amAzing!!!! Also, she reminds me of Tina Turner, here. Two awesome ladies. ❤😊❤
You know someone is a good artist when the music video is just her and a plain background but still so entertaining to watch
This is pure talent and it's already a classic in my books
Lookin like a young Jane Fonda 🤩 love  Miley always 🩷✨
On repeat
Lemme
Que fea cancion
Sigh not with Pharrell... :(
dayemz, what a body! beautiful!
Love it! Miley is an entertainer extraordinare!
This video is giving me Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” vibes
OMG Miley..why You waited so long to do this? OMG 🙀 youre fabulous,,perfect,, beautiful..OMG. love this ..all every single part of the video You look stunning,sexyyyy as hell,,perfect body,hair,outfit, mouth,eyes,dancing, OMGGGGG WOMAN!! BEST VIDEO I seen. God is good! Congrats! Now youre the sexiest woman i'm the world. Uffff!
😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Give it a minute for JLo to steal a look, move, concept...or most and to collaborate with Pharrell because that was her then...and still her, now.😂🤷🏾‍♀ Miley is awesome and has a great, sultry voice, looks amazing and shows her fans love.
Ok ok 😊
Our Smiley Miley. 😍😍😍
I love how strong she is become❤
Pharrell used Blurred Lines drums, you can kinda hear that :)
I miss when your songs were personal. This is straight capitalism
Miley 🎉 eres toda perfección ❤
Miley could be your dopamine 🤩🔥 Wow 🎉💫
she looks sooo much like her mom
Why Cher vibes 😍😍😍😍😍
The Legend is back🔥 Miley Ray Cyrus magic and aura. Unbeatable 💯🪄
All I see is young MADONNA OR LADY GAGA🎉 ✨✨😁
What an energetic song
Remade song of  Måneskin - I Wanna Be Your Slave
We ❤ Miley and Pharell
The beat is so strong
This reminds of a song by Måneskin: I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster Cause you could be the beauty and I could be the monster
This song is on fire🔥🔥
my god whats the lipstick on her??? i want it soooooooo bad😢😢
Damn it slaps
I love Miley
Love her raspy strong and soulful funk voice.  She’s gonna win another grammy
she is giving me lady gaga vibes
You can tell she's fully confident and having a good time and she wears the happiness from moments it's really best to watch her having fun with this sexy video she's so self enhanced true to herself kind classy and learning her selfher self and that's physically and so mentally healthy and the way she's looking for great and  having a great time  and she's blossomed into a fine young woman. you go Miley
it's like a blend of donna summer, xtina, and mick jagger. cute song and mv, fun disco energy.
Ha
So where's Pharrell???
She genuinely looks happy this time around ! I love this era for her 💛
Reminds me of the 1970's bobbleheads
Her dentist deserves a Grammy.
The most underrated female singer. Her and Selena leave Swift and Pink in the dust.
oh man you nailed it. amen to that  I'd say
Wow! who's the plastic surgeon?
Those dresses fit so well.
She reminds me of Gloria Trevi 😅
SUCH A BAD SONG
😂.  I don't know how to feel about it. Good for her. Work it out girl😊
❤❤❤
Who’s her dentist ? Avoid him / her at all costs. Poor Miley.
where is Pharrell ? xD
This is so bad.. Not michael jackson bad.. Just bad..😮‍💨
I wish I could un see this
👑 reinota ❤
Miley’s the new Cher. 😊
We still love Miley 4EVER 😑
Tina Turner vibes n hair
🥰🥰
動感翠鳳
alright, QUEEN!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
She is happy. And it shows.
It’s as if Jane Fonda and Tina Turner had a baby together.
Man I love me some miley but I always cringe watching her Music Videos cuz she sucks at lipsync...like really bad. But I love you miley!!
Yay I love you Miley!
ICONNNNNNN❤
What is that dance?
Vuelve hacer otra canción con el
Miley Cyrus tried to dress like Madonna in the 80s, today she wants to be Tina Tuner.
<3
Me waiting Pharrell Williams 😂😂😂😂
Wow... This song... Sucks.
Si Miley cantara en los 80 fuera la reina absoluta
This was so good, MILEY IS BACK
She looks so much like her mom ❤️❤️❤️
Esta canción me recuerda a "I wanna be your slave" de Måneskin
Miley is looking absolutely stunning 💕
Watch it on mute and her dancing is so stupid 😂
✨You go had on Miley you did that ✨
Great song, horrible lip synching
i saw britney behavior in her...😝😝😝😝
I FUCKN LOVE Miley new look & her new music!!! 🎙️🎶🎶
Oh she's AWESOME ❤
❤❤❤❤
I'm so sorry to criticize everyone🙏, but... The beginning of the clip seems to me a bit like an unsuccessful parody of the song by Beyonce - single ladies? I mean her dance creations
What is she working out ?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No.
👑❤️💫
It’s giving Angelina Jolie vibes from the side view 🤣
The new Tina Turner?
Look at that hot body. OMG 🥰
❤
Beautiful energy girl❤
She is amazing ❤
La Miley que queremos ver nuevamente 🖤❤️ puro 🔥
❤❤❤
She looks amazing !
God she's gorgeous! 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
OMG. Second outfits so cute!
It just keeps getting worse.
Yes, Miley! Yes!!
It’s been a weekend since this song released and I think I listened to it about 1000 times. The song is a definite earworm.
Wtf! Not nice song it's so weird 😪
She genuinely believes she is a singer from the late 70s...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She looks gorgeous
This song has the Blurred Lines vibe by Robin Thicke ft Pharell as well
yes! needed a good club banger for the warm weather.
I think this is the best I’ve seen Cyrus look. She looks gorgeous
Y'all m nt over yet It's giving me "FLOWERS" vibes still
To boring, to dull and to repetitive. Expected more Miley. But you will be back.
Remember beat a Robin Thicke - Blurred Lines
SHES GIVING DOLLY POP 🤠🔥
La reina
I think she could do better I do not like this song
And where is Pharrell Williams.
Beautiful little Miley Cyrus. I rem her dad appearing on the scene w that original mullet. This is like a tribute to her dad's original hairdo. It's the "tribute mullet,long version!" She's dead sexy too. This little girls body is GORGEOUS. m not big on taking the scalpel to a young girls face. Not unless she's got a messed up feature that NEEDS correcting. The complete removal of unique features among our youth is sad to me. I'm ALL FOR a lil procedure when needed too. The buccal fat surgery is great when you're 30 and want fat removed however that very fat that you girls are all removing to do for you what blusher and highlighter can do sans surgery,is going to cause every one to age more quickly. That's exactly what aging is the loss of all the fat and collagen and estrogen and JUICY STUFF that plumps us up. So they are ALL going to have to have that fat replaced and one might say SO WHAT! I WILL JUST REPLACE IT! that's not the real 🌎 tho because EVERY TIME THE BODY IS INVADED WHETHER WITH OUR OWN FAT OR FILLER IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH ONE EITHER THERE ARE SCARS. THERE IS SCARRING ANY TIME THE BODY IS INVADED BY anything So you aren't simply adding and taking away like a glass of water. You are adding and taking away materials that have to BIND TO THE EXISTING MATERIEALS IE. YOUR FACE AND BODY and there are internal scars created when no incisions are ever even used. Those fats and fillers HAVE TO BIND to the existing tissues and when that binding happens scarring also happens. Internal scarring can be Much WORSE than exterior scarring. When you are looking at a person whose had blephiraplasties and EVERYONE is la has had them if they are 25 or older,you will see linear scarring UNDER their facial skin almost always. It's ALL got consequences. There is no such thing as a consequence free successful procedure when you start augmenting the face in particular. I've gone off on a tangent Abt linear scarring! Lmfao! SHE LOOKS AMAZING AND SHES DEAD SEXY whether she's got dance skills or not. Baby girl doesn't need them. She can SANG SANG SANG as well this one here. She makes me happy when I see her. She's all joy and beauty! Go get em Miley. 🪨 that tribute mullet. Your dad's mullet is legendary and he was BEAUTIFUL AS WELL. 💯 My Achy Breaky ❤️. Omg you HAVE TO do a redo of some sort of that song chica! The Achy Breaky ❤️ one! While you are rocking this tribute mullet you need to go into a room and find a version of that Achy Breakiness that will resonate w the kids. It will be 💯 COME ON PHARRELL WTF???????
🌹
She beautiful damn
anyone hearing the “i wanna be your slave” resemblance in the very beginning?
This should be #1 on trending not #7

I miss Miley before
This was so fun!  With all the sexy going on, I kept seeing her eyes sparkling the whole time. You can laugh at me.
The song is good but she doesn’t need those 🦷 it’s unsettling 👎🏻
❤❤😭✨
Love her and this song not fan of the hair style
It's like Sheryl Crow and Tina Turner had a love baby though.  I love this so much! She's doing amazing!!!! ❤

Is it just me or that look is giving me Tina Turner
She's got a Tina Turner vibe and I'm loving it!
I like her old music but her current vibe. Wish I could blend them up a bit, haha. Like a modern version of 7 things would be so cool in this current Miley style. Her confidence would make it fun/dark/wonderful.
salúdame Miley XD
🥹🤏🏼 tão linda
Masterpiece.
❤

Te amo
From one Tennessean to another Miley is aging like fine wine This woman is on 🔥🫶🔥
She is literally quickly becoming my favorite female artist. So effortlessly cool and sexy and I’m a homo🤷🏿‍♂️
with this look she reminds me of the models on george michael's videos. Fierce, glam and playfull.
She's gorgeous
Bruh not my mom calling this softcore p**n
It starts very familiar...itstarts like Maneskin I wanna be your slave...to similar
What happened to her face? Is like a 💀
Big ass teeth 🦷

Sooo ...awesome
Que bella... I love his great energy... Viva Miley🎉❤
I really like her...but is she physically able to close her mouth? Im worried
This is everything. Giving Hannah Montana but she grew up and has found her true self 😭🦋
So where's Pharrel after all??? 😉😁
❤❤❤❤❤
She looks like a wraithwalker
Miley you are smoking!!!When i see you in person I'm gonna ask you to date me (even for a day).😌, Keep working on yourself. You are doing awesome.🙏🏽

LOOOOOVEEEEE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
It's her body for me.  It's clear that she's focused on HER!
This look is giving Kylie Minogue and I'm here for it ❤️ 😍
How come 6M views in 1 out of 3 days
This pharrel song was the one that sone say was a rip off marvin gayes. Personally i think they are different than. Great groove.
Já acreditava nessa música quando ela foi descartada de She is Coming, ainda bem que o hino de single foi lançado novamente. Dá-lhe Miley
Yes! 😍
This Is Sparta.
Solo vine a ver ese baile tan feo jaja
This is flirty, fabulous, and a fantastic video 🔥 Great song!
Umm, I’ve listened to this several times now… is she looking to be friends with benefits with the ex 🤭 Don’t get me wrong, I effin love this track!
I don't know what's really going on, but she at least LOOKS like she's having fun! Hell yeah, Miley
tune❤❤
She’s wearing the dress, but lacking the power and the moves 🙄 #tinaturner
Gotta admit, I liked the music, but not always how she presented herself in the past.  She's grown significantly vocally, always trying something new & slaying it.  A true artist.  Good for her!  She's definitely  made a fan out of me👏👏
FLAWLESS ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
love this song! its so fun!
Her look has a vibe of  Tina Turner in the 80s.
I'm 66 and am loving this!❤❤❤
Go Miley 🎉🎉🎉
She looks absolutely stunning! So beautiful.
"Work it out" like Beyoncé's song, the fan and flying hair like Beyoncé, the silver theme like Beyoncé's renaissance. If this song and visuals came out at any other time I wouldnt have said that. I've grown to love Miley Cyrus but this is just a big meh for me.
Miley, you are so much to me. Hart
Miley♥️
Im 100% sure there’s another part for this song ♥️♥️♥️ I soo proud and so happy for her ♥️🫂
With Miley, there's always a cool funky fashion show along with the tasty tunes!
She looks just like Ashley-O
She looks so odd in a bad way
Instrumental is giving blurred lines but good song
❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
Freshnesss at its best, awesome creative juices. Love how her projects are for sharing and inspiring good feelings, love how the productions are sexy without being sexual (if that makes sense). Keep up the great vibes M.C. & Team
What a bore of a song😢
Please hire a choreographer
1:17 a *beyond* stunning shot in an *AMAZING* video
❤
Esta en su etapa muy tina tuner😊😊peinado y bronceado..y por supuesto alta autoestima ❤
stupid vid but she looks great!
wtf? what happend with her? 😳❤😂🔥
💙🇮🇱💙🇮🇱💙🇮🇱💙🇮🇱💙
Cuerpazo  El ejercicio siempre nos hace ver mejor mera chimbA 🇨🇴aunq sino tuviera esos rayones sería más elegante ,
Måneskin - I wanna be your slave
Should have stoped with "I can buy myself flowers.."
Miley looks sooo strong and confident, love it ❤ we should all learn to love ourselves
Has a distinct blurred lines vibe. Not impressed especially with all the hype. I love Miley don't get me wrong
omg omg OMG
This gives me 80s Mannequin movie vibes. And I'm loving it.
God she nailed it again❤❤❤
A doc u fuckin beautiful!
That sounds just like Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE
Are you as strong as not letting me search for me through the music and words xylophone yes zone! #astoldbyanairagoaeiouyadiprsgenreog1998blessedgiftsonthebeatfinishline
Watched video again....so cool. And small minded haters, leave comments about Maxx alone. She seems happy!
Miley Cyrus you are really amazing I love you so much I am your biggest fan❤
Miley Cyrus you are really amazing I love you so much I am your biggest fan❤

We love to see her healthy and happy
This is Miley at her absolute best. She's is glowing she is smiling she is living her best life and I love to see it she deserves happiness
I love the fact that I had those sandels 20 years ago in black and white. But the white ones disappeared.
Miley is really loving herself. Good.
❤
The song is very similar to Maneskin one “I wannabe your slave”
I think this is dreadful ..... Ariana should have warned her !!
Here before 100M
Be you m LADY, show them where it hurts, do you ❤
Este look María Mercedes bien 90s
Perfect 💎
Hair and outfit- it remains extremely of Tina Turner.
And where is Pharrell?
Got that Dolly drag style of hair with a this kinda new mullet stlye, love it!!!
🎉 ❤ 🔥
LOVE IT! So fresh, so hip, so COOL!🤩😘
Miley, siempre bella! ❤
This is so cringe in so many ways
Love Miley, love Pharrell. Not a fan of this song.
TI AMOOOOOOOOOOOO❤❤😭😭
I think this is the PERFECT Version of her. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
If was someone’s else song no one would even do this to his ears.Veery bad song

Es como un leon, divina Hanna Montana  :3
Amo o talento e o trabalho dela! É admirável ❤🇧🇷
Boy has she changed. Beautiful as always. 💜💜💜💜💙💙
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
That looks like it was a lot of fun! <3
Parece música de programa da Colgate 😂
So where exactly was Pharrell?
Her inner Tina Turner maybe 🤷🏽‍♀️ I like it ❤
Veo a Maneskin versionando este temazo
Looking so fit and beautiful, but if she can add some meat, probably even better 😊
Nice this version of i wanna be your slave by Måneskin 😂😂😂😂😂
Gorgeous! I love everything, the throwback hair, the style, her well kept physique! Everything go Miley!!! ✨✨
Definitely a Tina Turner vibe! So fun, the joy is contagious! Pharrell and Miley🔥💥🎯🧨
What the hell is this
she's soo cute
I don't like this lol...I like alot but nope not this one 😅
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
She's a sweetheart...very talented ❤
She smells pouder . Good to see 🎉
Maneskin. I wanna be...
Miley Cyrus as Beyonce
https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?feature=shared
she is everything ❤
We love you ♥
She is so much better than Taylor Swift...sorry Swift fans. Will never understand how you award your artists.
All praise be on to the most high who made all things and sustain all things. AHAYAH HE IS ONE AND THERE IS NO ONE GREATER IN THE FINISHED COVENANT THE BLOOD OF the SON of man YASHAYA 🙏🏽✌🏽 be apart of the blessed hope and make it to the bema seat for rewards it left behind as the wicked who will have to try and pass thru the 7x lit furnace of the nuclear war the mark of beast and torture that comes with it if you reject it and judgment and destruction and the lake of fire that comes with it if u take it. Repent and come INTO the Ark of the most high (HIYAH) and the blood of the lamb be on your door post and let your oil lamps be filled up and into the wedding feast the hidden place the spirit the comforter will be there with u our savior will keep u with him in the time of judgment 🫡

I haven't seen her hair look like that in years
i think this song will be really big in a short time. she has the buzz of the grammy award but its a really catchy song.
I loved the song! I love your energy!😍
I mean, her voice is incredible and I know it since I've heard her for the first time....but I see a lot of Beyonce-like-style, and also the lyrics are....well....IDK, but anyway who gives a s..it bout my opinion :D :) keep going Miley :)
❤❤❤❤❤
Reminds me of Tina Turner
❤❤
Love it!!! ❤ Miley you "ROCK" !!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Flowers vibe
I love  her, but it doesnt makes cense do feauture him if he doesnt sing anything in rthe entire song
Miley Cyrus has a perfectly Barbie figure body ❤
It reminds me "Blurred line",  with Miley that seems like Tina Turner
Those ugly tattoos all over her body are actually spells...
Pharell and his team needs to send this to Radio AirPlay🥲
Reminds of Beyonce work it out also written by Pharrell
Fantastic 😍
She looks like Tina Turner, maybe.
тату жахливо виглядають
Wtf? This is so trashy
I love her
C'est nul !
Sbaglio o mi ricorda molto i maneskin 😮😮😮???
she’s really into the big hair lately…. lol
😍
why she looks so weird? what she has done to her face?
Reminds me of pussycat dolls I don’t need a man music video she looks incredible
OMG Miley definitely its stunning! Baby you rock!
Fun.
💋
This is her genre
almost as good as the Terry Richardson viddy
I hear Måneskin - I wanna be your slave. Seems like she took all from that song: music, hooks, even lyrics are similar. Seriously??🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Sounds like that Maneskin song..
Ok, I love her voice but honeslty I don't know why, I love her black sandal so much !
❤❤❤
Najbolja
Love the evolution of Miley's music <3
This is a masterpiece!
Don’t know why but it’s giving me Måneskin ‘ I wanna be your slave’ vibes. All here for it tho! Love it
Miley is just having fun with life and I love that for her
I’m waiting for Pharrell 😅
Kinda trashy :( i guess thats hollywood idk, i was expecitng more modesty for some reason lol
shes glowing and looks so happy <3
Pharrell sound!
Miley looks so much like Jane Fonda workout videos; I Love It! 😊
it sounds like bangerz's 4x4
https://youtu.be/ckOVLJT0mPY?si=zGoH9x350mkFKgIj
Gente, ela está numa leveza linda de se ver. Deslumbrante
Look at her bringing back that 80's hair.
It’s funny, when  you are an actual doctor
Great Miley, cheap music. The loop sounds so poor compared to her voice that is powerfull and energetic.
Yo creo que con esta canción ya estarás feliz en tu día en serio te lo digo es que no pone feliz a todos por su logro impresionante Gracias por ver esto ya estás feliz a bueno me alegro feliz día a todos ❤😊
I can hear the Maneskin Sound 🤔🎉
Simply the best
She's all grown up now and it's lovely isn't it?
I need that coat.
❤❤
Why is she copying Tina Turner?!! Get your own style. Girl.
Ion like this tho I’m still go for flower
Is me or Miley Cyrus sounds like gaga
YEAH!
Miley having the single childless aunt vibe lol
shit song. Great voice, i am disappointed at genius Pharell for wasting our time and his makin this crap
That hair is terrible 💀
OMG. It`s like looking at Jane Fonda late 1970s/early 1980s..... Looking hot... Great song
Corny!!!!!!
❤🔥🔥🔥
Shes the best!!!
What a body!!! Damnnnnn!!
Damn, Miley's body is just goalsss 💫😍
Sie ist erwachsen geworden u das sieht man 😍👏
It seems like a maneskin song at start
The hair is so bad
La plus grande show girl  actuellement Miley❤
That one part is very, "I Wanna Be Your Slave" by Maneskin.
Miley is so gorgeussssss
She shoot this video in a hurricane 😂😂🔥🔥
Hey miley
i need the trixie mattel reference confirmation to be leaked already
I’m so glad when Miley back to Miley
Bringing back that big, 1980's hair! I'm with it!
Amazing ❤
Miley was born a star
She reminds my of Tina Turner from the 70ies. Same energy and the dress reminds my of Tina's gold dress with fringe and sequin.
Yeeess ❤❤
This wasn't a favorite but you rocked it:)
What a fine, sexy, fun video from a cool woman! Please keep the dark hair.  .....
I love that she’s gradually going back to her brunette roots. I thought she looks so beautiful with her brown hair.
I love how it’s just her in this video!!!
Impressao minha, ou ela esta fazendo cover da Madonna anos 80?
Валькирия!
What happened to her dancing? It's like not much dancing.  Just jerks back and forth
ICONIC !!!!!!!
I waited the whole song thinking Pharrell was going to sing. 😂
i like this carefreeeeeee Miley!! it is so refreshing
Quelle merde.
Why dose this feel like she’s telling us what someone called to say to her
It’s giving early 2000s vibes 🔥🤌🏾
Would someone tell this lady she can’t dance for shit
❤❤❤❤
Clearly copying our Tina Turner in her dancing.
And to think some of us were here since the beginning, watching her grow into an incredible woman. Wow. What a pleasure. ❤
I don't know you... But I hear a little of Måneskin here... ☺️... It's probably just me hearing it. ❤
SHE IS SO CONFIDENT !!!!!!! ❤
I love you miley ❤️💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
Except the dynamic boost at vocals, the whole sounds like it is from late 2000's, early 2010's. If it had some weird mixmastering of latest popular songs, I would not add to my playlist so thank you for feeling all of those and turn into reality!
BECAUSE OF MILEY I HAVE FOUND MY ONLINE BESTIES  <3
The best!!!!
Am I the only one that hear Maneskin's song in some parts of this....
I see Tina Turner all over this and I love it!

Quem não entendeu a ref de tina tuner não sabe oque é pop de verdade
GOD 💙THIS WOMAN❤❤❤
I'm glad I'm not the only one who was reminded of Tina Turner. Shout out to all the underrated female artists! Love for them all. ❤️
Love it.❤❤❤
Im fuckin obsessed miley stop, its just you on repeat😂😅😍
the beginning sounds like Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE
Girl is channeling some Tina Turner!! I love it and Love her!!!  Go Miley!
Banging body, always been good but whatever she's doing now is WORKING!!!!  Well done on the song also ❤
👍
Miley’s on a winning streak and we’re here for it!!! So pretty, so confident + the iconic moves I can’t 🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
Strange mix between Tina Turner and Beyoncé..... Now, stop for a couple of seconds and ask yourself: would I still have watched this video if Miley wasn't in it? Poll is open....
What the fuck is this trash
Me encanta su Peinado ☺️♥️♥️♥️
Miley Cher Turner ❤
well, I dont see Miley clearly, I see Madonna.
❤❤❤amazing
Loving every Miley I see... My God she's GORGEOUS!
Miley the star.❤❤❤
She ruined that beautiful body with all those asinine tattoos
looks like she has really really been working it out too 💚✅💯💐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌷🌼🌸🌺🪷Miley is in top form !  Love love love her songs , her singing is so much better than the others !!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sure flowers was awsum. Bt this isn even that gud as much as u ppl r pushin it to be.
👻
It is a Mix between Maneskin I wanna be your slave and Wednesday… i somehow don‘t like it that much, but I love how confident and beautiful Miley is
I really love this ladyyy❤
Her dance is a Beyonce parody?
Where is Pharrell Williams?
Miley tf you doing with that hair it’s 2024 not 1974 😅
❤
A voz da Miley e sua energia é unica😊❤
Iconic
She is totally amazing
Она так такая классная ❤ она хоть кого заведет 🤌🏻
Miley would be so awesome if she has no tats on her bod. Anyways. Not to offend the tats community. But i really prefer her with a clean look
This is an L ngl
Doesn't this freak anyone out😮
"I feel like workin it out" vocal layerings are so Pharrell coded
This is really alluring.
I don't like her teeth. I don't like the dress. I don't like her hair. Mediocre song.
she is damn sexy in this video #fanforlife
I speak for the MÅNESKIN fandom and this song sounds NOTHING like IWBYS at all just the I can be your dr part but just because it’s similar lyrics doesn’t mean anything though
Cool song... Yet looking like Tina and sounding like Maneskin
It seems like Pharrell only added the beat of blurred lines.
❤
here Miley’s stan since 2009 and I do not possess enough words of how I am freaking proud of this woman. So so so talented. Beautiful inside & outside. Shining like a bright star. Grammys recent winner. An icon MILEY CYRUS, ladies & gentlemen!!! 🏆👸❤️‍🔥
Wow miley this your year
Ctrl+F  Lemme
Que joven se ve Gloria Trevi con su Doctor psiquiatra 😳😳👁👄👁
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Imi place de tine si tot ce faci, cum imi place si de Lady Gaga, sunteti pline de talent...
A little Tina Turner going on...
Tan..
Wtf is this … this is one of those ‘ change the station songs’
Nah cause the intro beat was giving _Blurred Lines_ 😳💃🏾
Grit is Earned Delicatesion only the few the G all the way😊
Nice nice nice and funny 🎉
Я так в прошлом году дома танцевала 😂😅❤
A MELHORRRRR
Hope this song will be number 1 and like flowers hope this song will receive awards
Another great song! Miley is unstoppable! Love her! This is my new Workout Song!
Damn! Gorgeous and great video but this is not country!
bravo Laurita León!
Wanna be Tina Turner, who told her this was ok...... Pharrell 🙄
Es ella misma y es lo que mas amo.
Like a 4X4
U CAN BE MY WIFE
❤❤México 🎉
Maravilhosa 🎉❤
Go Miley 👏🏼
yuck
Why she dances like a t-rex finally have long hands?
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Takes balls to do an entire video with a simple color background but she GOT THEM
Beautiful
so The Dude simply made the beat
https://youtu.be/0kF5zJIbn5U?si=eYq5WRrqnFmvSTsf
Très belle, en pleine forme, j'adore!
Loving the simple visuals, im so done with over produced music videos
Otra respuesta a otra canción 😮
I guess we are going back to over-skinny-celebs? :(
Miley is broke 😂
Very Bruno Mars. Love it!
Nice dress
She kill me.. When dance let me let me... ❤🎉🎉🎉
She's here
❤❤❤❤❤❤
The baseline is too repetitive & continuous.. this song has potential but not there yet. Needs more sonic interest.
It's exactly the same intro to Blurred Lines ❤
Its like the 80's hair style and fashion mixed with 90s and early 00s x miley and Pharrel and I am here for it!
I love how happy she is.
The little tounge at the end 😂 so cute
She looks amazing
https://youtu.be/czRTmVntyHk?si=yuGRXgRi95KGx554
This is Maneskin?
#freepalestine
I love the song but wtf did they do to her hair!
👍 👍
Young Vanessa Williams ❤️
the song is not really something that i would listen -even tho its not bad-. But I really loved her energy in this clip. She is literally shining and moving her body so freely like I can feel her happiness from 1000 miles away. I loved this new era of Miley ^^
جيت من قناة حيدر وليد 😂😂😂
Where's Pharrell?  Um...ick!
Miley is the definition of 30s being the new 20s
Sympathy
Finally
Yay
😢😢
Doctor
Let’s go
GREAT vid 👌 but was waiting for Pharrell as well 😂
Let’s go
Let’s go
Miley
Let’s go
Nice
Miley
Miley
Miley
Miley
Johnny sins vibing with this song 😅😅
Anyone 2015🧐?
My idol is Miley Cyrus❤
She looks ridiculous
Beat from Måneskin's 'Slave'
Miley is putting out Tina Turner vibes, with the song, dress, hair, (and it looks like she’s been working out-added a little bit of muscle 💪💪). ❤
It’s a no for me
El coro suena a la canción de Maneskin I Wanna Be Your Slave
Maneskin style
Musiquinha maneira mas cadê o Pharrell???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊
Настолько ужасный образ в платье, что он смог испортить даже такую красивую внешность, как у Майли Сайрус.
LA GRAN MILEY CYRUS SE VISTE Y SE PARECE COMO A " LA GRAN TESORITO MEXICANA LAURA LEÓN ". 💙💙💙🤣😂😁😉💖
No
Anos 80 , quem é dessa época sabe que tem tudo a ver! 👏👏👏🥰🇧🇷
Trying to remember what the intro and first verse reminds me of. Its "I Wanna Be Your Slave" by Maneskin
Milica
Wish she was my step daughter
This black Detroit 60's chick thinks she's not only channeling Tina Turner but she reminds me of Ann Margaret 0f  bye bye birdie and Viva Las Vegas. Loved flowers also she's a great young new talent. Go rebel!
Thank you Miley for including the Bisaya word 'LAMI' in your music. 😂
Song is giving me Maneskin vibes
It’s giving Tina Turner and I’m here for it!!!!!
Exorcisms be like
MIley is a ON FIRE, im melting from HERE <3
❤❤❤
❤❤❤🎉
She is ROCKING that hair. Don't give our girl a hard time about anything and she'll do it 10 times more. LOVE IT.
where is pharell  ?
She’s totally giving off Tina Turner vibes with her clothes and dancing ❤
María Mercedes,pa servirle a usted 🎶
Thx for not having that boat lips… One of the rare Natural beauties of Hollywood .
Her time has finally come ❤❤
She’s stunning, her best era
She is glowing!!!!!!❤❤❤
Nice!!
That was awful
16:9? Нужно 21:9
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
80s are coming back lol
Girl, yes. Absolutely love this whole transformation. She is just rocking it.
Serotonina en una cancion, ahora en bucle querida ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍💅💅🤟🤟🤟🤟
She’s giving Dolly Parton vibes 🎉💃🏼💃🏼
Vat is das?! Whole sale single ladies?!
Love the video and the outfits. Don’t like the song.
Didnt like the music much, but she is SHINNING !!!  Im loving that Miley fase <3
It’s giving 00’s Kylie and I’m here for it! 🤩
❤❤❤❤🎉
Only me thinking she is saluting to Beyoncé??
Barbarella.
la millor
Its amazing how i could just tell this is Pharell music
Pharrell signature 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
I love the new Miley 😍
Lets be who we are Together NOW it seems necessary Miley!
Beyonce - Work it out
I just don´t like her. Even with all the money in the world, the best dress, songwritters or whatever, I don´t like the spirit. Pretty surprised how everybody is just buying it.
Miley COME BACk!  I must have you in my arms right now.
I absolutely think she is way more talented then you know who lol she can actually sing.
👍
Miley, I don’t care if you did a cover of Pink Floyd I think Ariana Grande song is way more creative and I want to know who plots you two against each other because your new song really sucks even though I love you  did you realize Ariana Grande got to be creative and redo a Pink Floyd song for music video? It’s one of the most famous Pink Floyd song that were redone by a fan and roger waters so who screwed you over you didn’t even get your old time huh? Your producer hates you do you guys produce your own music or do you get told to do because I’m just trying to help you out from people who stay inside listen to music and analyze things and that’s so mean because Miley has the hippie foundation and you gave it to Ariana Grande again. Hippies are going to appreciate the most creative. https://youtu.be/7S8wllPmazM?si=AC8mpre2PKugr6F6
I love her recent style more and more ...
Miley is glowing but this song is trash i'm sorry. it already sounds like it didn't age well.
I guess her and arianna grande arn’t going to be friends…
I want that fluffy blue coat
Horrible
A good song at last. 🎉❤
YESSSSS MILEY BABY! ❤🎉
She's evolved so much from Hannah Montana. I love it !
Kaya pecandu obat atau alkohol wajah nya ,gak fresh
She just makes me wanna dance and not giving a sh*t bout what people can say
Best part is her Hair
Where is music?? Only self admire 🥺
<33333
wow! singing bassline isn’t for everyone! bravo🎉
Am I the only one that thinks Miley Cyrus is aging like fine wine?  I swear she lookin more and more like her mama everyday 😍
…TINA TURNER ISNT EVEN COLD IN THE GRAVE GET‼️😮‍💨
Love it, youre Amazing!
Maneskin- i wanna be your salve
idk why but I feel cringe watching her nowadays. What's wrong with me
Glad to see her being healthy and happy ❤ it's a true beauty! 😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
looks like a commercial for hair dye
Love it Miley  💙🦋
Gorgeous and talented as always! ❤
Hannah Montana Yes!
This Song Is so similar to " I wanna be your slave" of Maneskin, especially the beginnin! The sound,the rhytme....
Beautiful & rhythmic ❤gonna listen 🎧 in a gym.  Wow - 0:40
Tina Turner
Ela sabe que é a mais mais, quando sustenta um clipe só ela e um fundo cinza
Scorpio queen! 🔥🔥🔥
Damn she looks so much like Tish Cyrus here, funny how she used to look like her dad when she was much younger during hannah montana era
Miley Cyrus should play Sindel in the next Mortal Combat movie.
Very Good for a low badget MV 😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I truly admire Miley's fearless quality. She's never inhibited from experimenting with different sounds & genres + her aesthetic is always 💣
Queen! 😍😍😍
Love to see this ‘old skool’ confidence on Miley. She reminds me of the Shania Twain music video days back in 2000- pure fun and LOOKS for days
Sta omaggiando la divina Tina. Le vibes sono altissime. <3
Eating suggar
❤❤❤❤
Copy of Maneskin - I wanna be your slave
she says “ Dame dame”?
If u can’t hear  what I’m trynna say ……. Baby I’m goin down. Hey hey …
Love this
❤❤❤❤❤
miley eu te amo mas que cabelo é esse
Why does it say Pharrell Williams when he's not there at all? Clickbait much :(
I am in my Miley Cyrus era
All the ppl who sell themselves to the devil start looking the same, promoting the same ideology which is fake freedom that lies in taking off your clothes and live a fornicated life. Just executing demon.s plan for human beings to book their seats in hellllll. The common think is that these singers start to look the same starting from madonna going through jen lopez, beyonce, I don’t know all their names and there are also guys... There r many normal singers singing normal songs but thos so called icons are really the soldiers/slaves of lucifer. Thanks to Allah SWT for guiding me to right path and stay away from all kinds of music and singing while it was all replaced witgnthe love of theQuran. Ma sha Allah waAlhamdullah
I adore how NATURAL she is. It really seems that she is just having fun, and just being herself. Beautiful voice, body, style, and even makeup, which is almost nude and makes her even more gorgeous. ❤ True free spirit!
Ugly song 😂
Omg she’s amazing! I just get a huge smile from her latest work. Love her! 🤩
Waited for Pharrell…
❤thats my myli
It takes a beauty YASSS
This is cool darling really love this song darling excellent ♥️💋♥️💋♥️💋♥️💋
I don't know but she's looking even prettier and fit
The chorus sounds a bit like Måneskin - I wanna be your slave 🙂
Love this!!!
Yay, Miley! 🎉
HER ENERGY IS EVERYTHING!!!
This dress is hot
Wow this song sounds like he put in as much effort as they out into the choreography.
Nice song. But she needs to see a dental hygienist though. That gingivitis looks bad
She reminds me of a modern version of Ann Margaret (Elvis era).
Only disney star with an actual voice
我前陣子一直看到畫面想說是哪首歌 好聽
😻😻😻😻😻
Sorry but I'm disappointed with the direction her career is turning in, thanks to Plastic Hearts I became a fan but newest songs are mid
Sounds like Måneskin.
Straight off the Grammy stage to record this 🤭😻
The fact that her and Pharrell created this song during the Bangerz era, 12 years ago is INSANE!!! Sounds so fresh and damn Miley looks 🔥🔥
💝💝💝💝
Someone said it would be a flop 😂😂😂 ❤
Shes burning like it💋⚘️👏👅
Beautiful stunning and extremely gawgess Miley, I love you I love you l love you, that's a fact, you have my heart and soul, ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧 xxxx 😘💋😍🥰❤️‍🔥🥵🔥

https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=trjVc7AOWCaASjaX I can hear an influence by Maneskin song. Nice vibe!
She is absolutely so beautiful!!!!

❤️
Just wow❤
This Song is good
♥️♥️♥️♥️👏
Excelente    super 🎉
To think this gem could have been on Bangerz. Love how her voice aged compared to the original leaked demo. Perfect time to release this song now!
🤢
Sie ist eine der wenigen die als Kind schön hübsch war aber je älter sie wird umso hübscher wird. ❤
🔥🔥🔥
I’m getting Tina Turner vibes with that dress
Shania Who?

❤❤❤❤
Wher iy parrel wiliam no the look.
I was born in 2001, so I don’t know what it was like back then- but I feel like this is straight out of the 2000’s Era
Hype 2 milion subcribe PEDROSGAME
Awesome performance and her range fits the song so well. Gorgeous video and very enjoyable
Miley looks so pretty!
That’s better than her punk/naked/strange period 😅 I’ve never been fan, just curious today, she’s better.
Can we just kill the hairstyle. It’s so weird
Where is Pharrell 😅
Mylie Cyrus looks like a rag blowing in the wind
Barbarella mk 2. ❤
Thank you so much, Miley and Pharrell!
Where is Pharell ?
This sounds like a target commercial 😞

That raptor Miley is taking dance lessons from has really improved her dance skills.
Wow amazing
Queen😍
So Pharrell isn't actually in it?😅
Served
Mother Miley is serving hard af
Its too good
She looked like she was genuinely having a good time on that shoot; no pretentiousness, natural confidence, playful flirtatiousness, content and free.  It's great seeing her like this 🌹
Pure art
Hunny its flamy
Whose old music is Pharrell stealing this time?? I like this tho.
❤❤❤
Te amo Miley from Madrid❤
What a great song
Bamm this slaps
Miley in her lady gaga era
Продюссеры ей дали команду искать новый образ, она сильно повзрослела. Но материал откровенно слабоват.
This has an 2010 feel that I appreciate.
❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah! Ineeddoctor!!
damn Miley ..a tutorial on this look cause it's on fiyyaaaaaaa
Dislike buttons 😊 nope 🎉❤
My Queen❤❤❤
ปังมากแม่❤
This is different
It's giving Tina Turner... what a look!
Miley’s upgrade 😍
This song would've killed it in 2012
Im glad they held the song until now.
finally she got back doing bangers
Miles is in her PRIME.
I’ve always thought she looked like Jane Fonda. Now, she really does.
sounds like blurred lines. 😂
The beats sound like blurred lines…
❤❤❤❤❤
Love it ❤. Like ur voice so much super unique
She has nothing to do. What the worst dance!
Not going to lie when I first saw this video I was like what… now I love it for me her look gives Elvira and Dolly Parton vibes ❤
She needs to eat more mcdonalds
Miley Cyrus a see you happy, good!!!🎉🎉🎉
It's the pop version of Beyoncés work it out, also produced by Pharell (surprise.surprise.....surprise surprise!!!!) It's a cute lil bop tho 💯
Miley luce como RACHEL WELCH 2024.. mesmerize
La Tina Turner en versión dientuda 🤭
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
She's ready for her next GRAMMY. 2024 SOTY.
Love also her unreleased song  "Fucked up forever" or "hands of time"...  That song was good, hope it comes out too like "Doctor"... ❤
❤❤❤
Miley's insane for this
Ok Tina Turner
Sounds like i wanna be your slave by maneskin ♥️
RETURN OF THE PHARELL WILLIAMS   ( happiness is the truth)
This song was straight up dogshit
Full power dance and actitud e.. Great celebration...😮🎉❤
Confidence donation please?
Have you heard the new twenty one pilots song called Overcompersate?  Ya escucharon la nueva canción de Twenty one pilots llamada overcompensate?
That was so fun to watch!!
You are a light we all need ❤
Actually reminds me of disco
Look like Troye Sivan for me😭
Where is Pharrell Williams?? Love the song though! Make me wanna dance
I feel like she is the, Whitney Houston/Modana/Jacket Jackson of her generation. I feel like she is making her R.E.S.P.E.C.T. music. With the flowers song her dancing, I see the growing in her. She is doing a good job.
You can be the beauty, and i can be the monster 🎼🎼🎵
From the demo to this is definitely something TO BE PROUD OF👏
Love it miley❤
I'm getting serious Donna Summer vibes here.
I love this for you Miley!
This verse reminds me of a Maneskin song.. I could be your slave?
Sounds so much like “I wanna be your slave” song !!
Ok we know she has braces but baby them teeth are now some beautiful veneers and I like she got them as wide as her originals
She is gorgeous! There is a joyfulness about her.
Forever on repeat
Just when I was giving pop music a break, Miley & Pharrel pull me back in
On repeat
Sorry… if i ever offended anyone. I used to hate Miley but now kinda admiring her… I used to hate her when she was younger dressing to sexily/ bold.  I didn’t understand her. However, i admire her new mature bold unique personality of hers now.
boring😢
Hermosa y talentosa Miley Cyrus salvanos con tu ritmo y música del cáncer auditivo que estamos viviendo en México que se llama peso pluma y santa fe klan
This is a song for a 50 year old washed up singer.
Me encanta ❤🌺

I really love her voice, but man she just can't dance. :)

I noticed she started copying Tina Turner lately
Queen
🔥🔥🔥
I love her hair like this!
Go Miley!! 🎉
She has a little bit of Kylie Minogue vibe and a tone body as Tina Turner ❤
Hermosa canción 😍  Estilo a la década de los 40 50 60 70 o 80
She is someone that shows you can come through the other side of adversity and thrive!!! Keep it up!
Slayage
I love❤
I just can’t keep hearing “I Wanna Be Your Slave” by Måneskin the first part, sorry had to say it
Ay no que mujer tan espectacular ❤
I do love how simpliy beautiful you are natural and all!!
❤️🥰🙌🏾🕺🏾🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💃🏾😍🙌🏾❤️
Where's Pharrell?
the songs sounds like a bad copy of blurred lines; and she looks awful dancing like stupid. The song is awful.
Was her face renovated?
Doctor psiquiatra de Gloria Trevi  en otra versión
Miley is glowing and she ain’t gonna stop. It’s beautiful 🥹
Co s Tebou ženská?
Loving the fact that Miley is bringing back the big hair trend of the 80s. Saw here Grammy performance this year, hot damn she is fierce and fly, and hitting her stride musically and I am all for it.
Barbarella vibes! 👏👏👏😜
I wish jeon somi and miley make a collab, they have the same energy
Ese estilo retro parecido a Tina Turner me encanta, ella es toda una show woman!!! 🤩🥰
She has pretty teeth.❤

Hannah montana ❤
I like it, so the girl can sing.

I fucking LUVVVVV it 😂 her hair, the cheesiness, she looks so amazing and 80’s. Love the direction she’s going with her career. Bringing the old school style back we all grew up seeing our parents like and making it new and cool and amazeballs
she's absolutely stunning, yay for her!!!! her music is amazing
Cerdena está que se muere de envidia

Apart from the new sound, her body looks SNATCHED 🥹🥹
Mi nueva canción favorita ❤✨🎶

Qué dientes tan grandes le puso su dentista 😷

MANESKIN 1:39
Va a sacar un nuevo disco?
queen❤❤❤❤
I always like her. She has strong personality and she shines everywhere.Her voice is amazing beautiful. ❤❤🥰🥰🥰💕💕💕
There is no room for one more Tina or Dolly. Just be Miley
Miley is a real rockstar
It's obvious that her sexuality is maturing right along with the rest of her, and it's SO HOT. Just becoming so solid in herself.
Thank u for feeding us mother
She can sing on absolutely EVERY music genre!
It reminds me “Coconut”, one of my favorite songs.
Me encanta esa energia de miley con esta cancion a lado de pharell wiliams es la primera vez que escucho este ritmo muy bien representado y apoyar mas esta cancion qye sea un hit mundial y empezare a contribuir vamoz por mas ❤❤❤
Amooooo❤
My review: qué pelazo 👏🏼
We are getting new Tina Turner here..
Where does Pharell feature in this! All I can hear and see is Miley?
Bad she bad😻💯🏹🍾
Miley
Definitely in her Tina Turner phase and I ❤IT
Slay on another level
❤ this song touch this girl heart❤.
💙
Pffffiiiiiouuuuuuuu....He didn't sprain his wrist that time  the Pharell.....You should file a complaint against him.....🤣🤣
OMG I love the vibe of the song and the video..Miley is superstar..I love u Miley from Philippines🇵🇭🥰🥰🥰♥️
🗑Eminem said this🤔 https://youtu.be/EbmcowfAGBU?si=4RAaXGPPuBpT_D7T
Okay Miley!!! I see you ❤️❤️😍😍❤️❤️😍😍
What is with the Tina turner hair she's rocking nowadays
Can we still call it an inspiration? It's a little bit too much.
I can see all the tik toks imitatimg some of these moves already haha this is some quirky Disney movie choreo IMO. LOL No hate though-still love me some Miley ❤
3 marzo 2024 7:20
White people embrace and support change, and black people critize change.
i think she has grown alot i enjoy her music but new to the videos❤
I hope she finds herself someday...she's talented but...idk she's just all over the place?
This girl body is goals!!
Attendance check miley fans🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤im present 😊😊😊😊😊
The face is EATINGGGG😍🔥
Love miley  cool song 🎵
❤❤❤❤❤
Good for her. She’s so talented and seems like a sweetheart  as well. And talk about being able to transition  from kid star to adult…👍
Mackie doll ❤
I like it, but yeah,pharrels singing?
Pharrel Wiliams always slaying 🔥
I like cardi and Miley both but I don’t understand how Miley has over 5 million views trending at #6 and cardi has less trending at #1 with almost 4 million views. Someone please explain to me how that works. They both dropped at the same time
This is terrible.
WE LOVE YOU MILEY!!! ❤❤❤
I can see 2024 is going to be the year we take it back old school
Can I just say, how freaking awesome is she! Live ur best life, gurl!❤
LOVE THIS WHOLE VIBEEEE THE HAIR, OUTFITS EVERYTHING
Cringe
simplesmente perfeita belíssima! ♥️
Pensei que ela ia fazer a dança da vandinha😂
I'm a fan but.....
Miley be looking like a fucking goddess!! 😍😍😍
Love it. Let's dance Miley ❤
1:39 she remind me of Azshara from wow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hndyTy3uiZM 4:28
Where is William farrell
❤❤
I love Miley, but this is super mid. This is not the single.
This sound like Miley swallowed a pill that on side says Tina Turner and on opposite side it says GaGa ..Okay Miley Monster rock out.  Dance on
I would say more Anne Margaret hair and dance vibe?
Where is Pharrel Williams?
You are an absolute queen Miley but please no more Botox your whole face and look is getting to plastic you are e literally naturally beautiful don’t become Hollywood your you
I've never seen Miley so happy  S2
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Obrigado Miley Cyrus, melhor de todas, você faz um trabalho incrível, sua voz e sensibilidade combinam demais com qualquer ritmo.
"She possesses an innate elegance, with a talent that transcends the ordinary. Her singing is a symphony of beauty and grace, leaving an indelible impression of awe and admiration."
i love miley but all of pharrell’s songs sound the same.
Es la copia de Thalía cuando cantaba María la del Barrio. Se copió de todo
Your legs....are absolutely amazing....You hot chick! I love you Miley! ♥️😘
I am so unimpressed with her, her lyrics and her obsession with herself.
This is a breath of fresh air from her
#Nurse 🎉 #Lover 😮 #body #workout 😊
Bombe❤i love u Miley
First of all am I the only one who thinks Miley’s new song sounds a little too much like Manskins “ I wanna be a Rockstar? Also same thing she did with Flowers and Bruno Mars song “When I was your man.. ?” IDK, just saying.. as an artist that would not be too cool
Sorry, not feeling it.
It sounds like Måneskin but its less catchy.
More videos!!!!!!! Go girl!
I don't like it
She looks like she's having so much fun!!
at first glance i didnt like the hair, but good god does she work it really well
How can you NOT love Miley? 😍❤
I was waiting for Pharrell
Завораживает. Беспорно  талантлива и прекрасна. Но не покидает некое ощущение, что в этом всём нет её настоящей. Будто она постоянно играет с тем, что от неё ждут, и подругому уже и не может.
Queen ❤
I love the queen of flowers
My favorite part is where Pharrell sing (...)
One view was enough
I love this miley cyrus era
Amooooo ❤ minha Miley happy ❤
Love Miley !!!
This is great! Work it out then girl..
Elle est toujours à moitié à poil, Miley, c'est son fonds de commerce.
Miley’s body little similar with Tina Turner including few of her dance style .
She is clearly going through a Tina Turner era and I am LOVING IT!!!!
Before I want into this I thought it was going to give the same vibe as happy so glad that it’s not
i love her voice and now her haircut also 💛
Im just wondering were’s pharrel?
tremenda vooooz💖😍❤️
🕺🏽
Slightly more classy than usually Miley
Giving me Tina Turner vibes. GO GIRL!!!!!!!!!
I'm hearing some Manaskin influence in this. "I wanna be your Slave". Just sayin'  Also, the 4 first beats sound like "Crazy" - Gnarls Barkley
Wow 😍😍😍
Maddening groove but, is it just me or does the sample sound like Maneskin?
She has new teeth! They look amazing 😍
Love Miley!
Can somebody please buy her a new dress?
This got some Tina Turner and Vanessa William vibes.
I love her but not the tattoos
At the Emmys and here her inner Tina Turner with hair and style shining brightly. Love it.
I think Pharell didn't make the final cut. LOL
Whitesnake _ Here I go again_ ❤ Aerosmith _ Cryin'❤
Veo mucho disfrute y buen  rollo. Ella esta mas feliz ❤ Ella brilla más que nunca.
Better than Taylor.
🌈🎇🏆🏆🏆🏆🤟🎶🌟😎🌟🎶🤟🏆🏆🏆🏆🌈🎇
The goddess is back
A gifted woman
Mileys getting better with age! Love this new era of her
Perfeitaaa
Once again, Miley trying too hard to stay relevant and making shitty mainstream music with her raspy voice.
❤💜
I need her workout and nutrition guidelines because her body is amazing
She’s not the best dancer
"90 возвращаются.😂 Она  явно копирует клипы 90 -начала нулевых."00 годов. Майли ,ты разочаровала😢
Solo a me sembra simile ad una canzone dei Maneskin? 🙀
There is little kids starving on Palestine and you are just going to Work it out? You make me sad guys. Where is your heart or empathy? 😢
It reminds me of a Maneskin's I wanna be your slave
She could do the craziest cringe moves and still get away with it. 👌👌👌👌💚💚💚💚💚💚
You Miley are now growing like a lioness and for good.I want you to know that my eyes are opening more and better and my ears are also stereos because of you.
This is a drag race anthem for sure. Can’t wait to see a fierce queen slay this.
What a woman, she’s gorgeous! I think she’s trying to convert me to be str8.
Love this !
Excellent would be a collaboration between Miley Cyrus and Shakira
Grim.
Ok I may be crazy but this is #GETITRIGHT'S sister and I'm here for it!
Whats with the Wednesday dance?
What a very very remarkable performance . The best of new performance renew her owner lovely unprompted Goodheated Miley Cyrus...she said the opposite of every category...as if blame who wasn't true enough... wonderful to watch especially as brand new one before only Two three days only....Thank you Miley Cyrus to make PEOPLES happy with such amazing performance..3March 2024
Was i the only one that smiling watching the video? It’s great seeing her being herself and smiling. She look amazing! Love Miley
Schon wieder ein halber Porno, warum muessen diese Weiber fast nichts anhaben? Kleider sind unbezahlbar...
Where my future doctors gang at?
So glad disco is baaaaack 🪩
The beat is very close to Måneskins "I wanna be your slave" ...
I think I will never understand her 80' hair styles but in all another way I love and respect her so much.
Her hair in this is EVERYTHING ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG CAN BEYONCÉ AND MILEY DO A COUNTRY COLLAB!????
The Hair.... no goXD...
el vestido omgg lo necesitoo
I love you Miley Cyrus 🥹❤
im feelin this.
Where tf is Pharrell 😊
amo demaciadoo
loveee it
It's looks like shampoo commercial
Miley is amazing. She can be a different person with a whole new persona in her music and videos effortlessly.
👎👎👎👎👎
Maneskin should sue Miley.  What a rip off and the song is horrible.
No matter what she does... I just keep thinking Dolly Parton.
Blurred Lines vol2
❤❤❤❤❤
PLEASE release KISS SOMEBODY 😭❤️❤️❤️
The absolute DIVA!!! Miley deserve the best, this is one of her best moments.
So cool she’s recycling Bangerz era tracks
❤
MILEY QUIERO QUE SEAS MI DOCTORA GO 😍🥰
This song sounds really fun ❤ Her voice is unique. Miley Cyrus is a grown and gorgeous woman now ❤ Love it ❤
Isn't this a remake of someone else's song?? It needed more bass and drums. Also, she should've had background dancers and not have worn her Grammy dress. It's too much her. The fur was beautiful tho😮
Hit🤎
mitou divaaaa
Miley's voice just hits different!! Love her voice!! Love her music❤❤❤
Miley so sexy.
Te amo mãe
Not originally at all this very tina turner at least she has clothes on whats the mullet hair anout very masculine is narsastic miley
Absolutely sublime! Miley has had such amazing growth and evolution that she’s a true icon. I know this isn’t going to be popular to say….but she’s so much more talented than Taylor Swift. Taylor may make bank but she has zero growth in her music. Miley isn’t just more talented and diverse but her body of work is a journey of her life yet she could walk away from it all and be totally ok with it. Love her so much!
🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
❤❤❤
I'm now obsessed with this new Miley song 🥺😭
This is the year of uplifting music
Przecież to nie ona. Zupełnie inny zgryz, ale goje łykają. Głosu też nie da się tak zmienić, chyba, że przez program
Lame
Lovenn❤❤
Im here before radio stations.
Oh u didn't forget to wear your underwear now like on Grammy???
Getting prettier and sexier.
WELL I GUESS I FINALLY FOUND A PROFESSIONAL DOCTOR 😍
Mira lo que te perdiste Liam
The beat is similar to I Wanna Be Your Slave by Maneskin
Giving me mad 1970s Jane Fonda vibes. LOVE IT. Not to mention how much fun she clearly had making this whole she-bang
tun tun tun
*Parabéns Miley! E o Pharrell nunca decepciona!* 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Cyrus entering her Madonna phase..
Z hair is giving dolly vibe❤
Te amo😘🙌😘😘
Miley
This dance Its so annoying! Copied Tina Turner vibes, and Wednesday dance hand moved.. The song is silly, not unique, and also what are these face expressions??
Confidence we all love
Where is Pharells William
Why does she look a little like Beyonce single woman look? She is waayyy better though!
Awesome song. Miley looks amazingly on the stage, with much confidence in herself, whether she is dancing, singing or doing both.   P.D: Don't know guys, but I'm still waiting for Pharrell's part 😅😅
Miley❤❤❤❤❤❤
😍🥰😍🥰😍
❤
I AM HERE FOR THIS! She looks amazing
Te amo Miley ❤
Love Miley 💃🏼✨
Amo look anos 70! ❤❤❤
💃🏼✨💃🏼✨💃🏼
I feel like her new style is inspired by Thalía😁
The beginning reminded me of Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE
Don’t like it. Sounds to monotonous.  Bit try hard
Her voice is EVERYTHING!!!! She's unapologetically MILEY. Love this!!!
Awesome playful vibe
Se parece a Gloria Trevi🙈
La amooooo
Wow
Loving Miley Cyrus since episode 1 of Hannah Montana 🤗
This new look - If Tina Turner & Kylie Minogue had a baby 🥰 💕
sempre será dona da indústria
Big stinky shit from USA
miley in her princess of rock era...good time to be alive
I'm definitely taking this song with me to the gym class, lets work it out 😅❤❤
Maneskin?
STU   PE.  NDA
Como pode ser tão linda? ❤
What exactly did Pharrell do? Did he loop the baseline?
Am I the only one who see Tina? Miley is amazing though
ONLY ONE
com todo respeito a musica é horrivel de chata
I loved her very much, but her stance and voice for a ceasefire and killing in Gaza saddened me
It's in my profile description. thank you alll 💙🎉😊😊😊😊
Listen to my song.. Thankss😊😊😊😊😊😊🩶🩶🩶🩶
https://youtu.be/Xt-LFKFkDxY?si=XK1v6OxUjtcZf73N 💪
🎉🎉🎉
🎉🎉🎉
Just once in her era, her hair stylist stop changing smth. Let her hair alone
Cut to: the drag race lip-sync for your life to this.
i love miley but make a duo with a flop person is gonna end up a flop
U BETTA DO DAT SHIT MILEY!!!!
I don't like her but hair on top. It works look better laying a bit flatter. Just my opinion.
She looks great.
She’s so happy now ❤
Love Miley but not this song 😂
Looks old af
Pharrell? 🤔
This video giving me Beyonce "I'm a grown woman" vibes. Miley has learned to dance. She is in what looks like the best shape of her life, with sculpted leg muscles, a tiny waist, and a defiant dark brown mullet teased to Dolly Parton heights, which she's throwing all over her shoulders, tripling her image, and singing with that throaty whisky and cigarettes voice. Yes, it works, but lacks the playfulness of Bey's "I'm a grown woman" because Miley has to work so damned hard at looking like it's easy. For Beyonce, it IS easy.
Sa geht noch viel mehr. ❤
Pas encore cette coupe 😭😭😭😱
#5 on trending❤❤❤❤❤  lets get it to #1
She looks great. 🤩🤩🤩🤩 The song ….as they say in Italian “cosi cosi”. 🫳🫴🫳🫴
I would love her to have a gig somewhere in the uk. I think I would cry if I got to experience her live, same age as me, followed her since Hannah Montana and this and the Grammy’s is the best I’ve ever seen her personally, I think she’s so fab ❤
Está mujer está más guapa que nunca. Me encanta❤
She’s so freakin gorgeous
Pharrell and Miley collab always hit
The Diva era slaps 💃🪩😄
0:00 play it in times 2 speed😂😂😂😂
Love this
For sure, one of the most interesting artists to have developed further in recent years. It feels like Miley has taken the time & pace to grow and come into her own. Her charisma is off the charts. She's super talented, has developed her own quirky, authentic rock style & her voice is phenomenal. <3 <3 Sometimes a break up does do you good. Hope, we come to see many more great tunes & performances by her. :)
Where's Pharrell?
It sounds like an aerobic song
Arrazou, garota. Kisses from Brasil.
Espectacular ❤ me encanta
She needs those chompers  done again.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Brasil presente miley 😉
I was waiting for Pharrell's part during the whole song 😅
Def giving beyonce on this one, nevertheless she looks great and really come into herself
Hopefully she does not work it out with that Liam Hemsworth. Keep smiling Miley ❤
Hm, ok. Sounds like every other white girl out there 🤷🏾‍♀️
اغنيه عاديه
❤❤❤❤ thanks
Another Grammy on her way 🔥
I love this ❤
She almost look like  Angelina  Jolie in this video she looks great love the song !!!!❤❤❤
I think Miley’s been looking at Tina Turner videos.
God, she looks like she's aged 30 years in the last 5. That said, this song is better than the trash she's been putting out since hannah montana ended.
We don't deserve her.
Replica de tina turner
Who’s this?
I love herrrr
Where's Pharrell??
Not gonna lie: this slaps pretty hard. Although Miley owes Jorgeous some backend points for stealing her “punching the ghost” trademark.
Doctor
Miley
❤🎉❤😘 love it 😊
When the video is more powerful than the actual music
In this, her face gives Jared Leto's vibes.
Sexiest lady, nice song ❤❤❤
Hmmm... Tina Turner??.... Is Miley trying  to bring that vibe back?...
ugh...just like all the rest. She has such a unique voice NO MORE!!!!! Went to the dark side of sameness just like all the rest.
It’s giving shot on iPhone ad
It's giving me... Maneskin!!
Seems like the bob mackie dress is having its moment rn
Boring Song
I want to film a music video in one of those sky diving tunnels in las vegas.
She finally have grown up and less boy toy.
Nothing can stop this queen, Miley you're EVERYTHING✨💛
Where was pharell at?? Lol
Please no with that hairstyle!
Nice! I can see my self running to this song! Such a vibe!
Increíble la energía de Miley
absolutely wowed, ngl
where is the lipstick from?
Please god Miley come work me out lol
Is Mile the new Tina (Tunner)? Beautifully body, dance, voice. A full pack.
Siento que su estilo al menos en cuanto a imagen es muy similar a Tina Turner con ese cabello voluminoso y los vestidos brillantes y bailes locos, aún así me gusta lo radiante que se ve 😊❤
Thank You, Miley for providing me with "New Drag Material";  for when I moved to Vegas, and take over Drag;  ( in my world, in Vegas );  Digging the look, and the vibe;   "New Grammy Award";  Here she comes....    :o)
Holy fuck
Loving the positive vibes and lyrics. Keep it up! Same with flowers :D
Woooo that was painful to watch
Aaww that's marvelous!!! And the outfit? Man, no comments! So stunning!  Super diva 👏🏻🤩
She looks very nice in this video.
https://youtu.be/vgvhQqvO7hA?si=PdmGoM4CEaROTiN6
I liked all miley cirus songs. This one is not bad but it kinda has no character to hold on to. And is pharell williams a DJ now?
Miley Cyrus vs Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE?
gaga vibe ❤
This Tina Turner phase doesn’t suit you, hope you’ll get to your authentic self soon. Also, what a generic childish song. Waisted talent and beauty…
Wuhuuuuuu so sexi. I love it
The one and only sensational! 😊 1:43
She has the most unique, characteristic voice, absolutely the most beautiful body in showbusiness and hypnotizing personality 😊
SO QUEEN
Te Amo❤soy tu súper fan!❤quitense que Miley llegó con todo😊
The beginning and chorus part of this song reminds me of “I wanna be your slave” by Måneskin… Is it just me?
Måneskin- I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master and other song salads
is it #maneskin?.
Still waiting for Pharrell's verse
As a dental student: great teeth and gum line!
She looks amazing. Great song.  I need to know her “workout” 😂
Iconic!!
This is giving Jessie Ware vibes.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
She dances like Trixie, and that is awesome
Work It Out Mama 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻❤❤❤
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
It sounds like blurred lines and happy 🙄
😊
Where is Hannah Montana....inocent angel😉🫣........ hmmmm !!!???
Favorite song ❤
This song sounds like I wanna be your slave by maneskin, especially the intro
Mamasita rika
❤❤❤❤❤love IT
Killer Era Miley is 🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been seeing clips of this on FB reels and it’s been driving me crazy how I know this song, and it finally occurred to me that it sounds like a disco version of “I wanna be your slave” by Maneskin
MiLEY       AMAZiNG
SiNGER      GABRiEL    HENRiQUE     MUSiC
!¡!
White tina turner...
This era just seems so unauthentic 😢 still love her tho
I truly admire her growth as a person and as an artist!  Miley’s so talented, her voice is amazing and she looks spectacular and so happy!  She deserves every bit of her success ✨
Only to me the song reminds Maneskin slave?
Warum ist Pharell vor ihr - bzw überhaupt genannt... Er kommt nicht vor. Seit wann sind Produzenten Interprwten?
😱😍
Let’s dance 🪩💃🏻
Thalia latina.    😂
buccal fat removal and ozempic looks awful
At :20 sounds like beyonces “work it out”. From her hair and to the way she’s dressed just screams beyonce, I can’t see past that
I’m really loving the new album and sound from Miley. She’s awesome.
Watching this on mute looks like a dental advertisement 😆 but srsly, her body is such a goals
Rolling stones HEHE🤣 39307 DE tu bende zabieraj mie z tad plis do USA
She’s amazing 🤩
Muy 2012/2013❤
She’s stunning and trendsetting 💜🩷
Iconic ❤
I can see some shade of Beyonce in this song
yo resuelvo 🧚‍♀️
Que canción tan insoportable...🤮
She really looks better with time ❤️
My music couldn’t be more different than hers… yet the respect and appreciation I feel for her and the energy she exudes are absolutely uncontainable. She’s giving Tina Turner’s vibes 🩶
I have a composed lyrics turned to a great song that will make u great, Miley C.
In my opinion, Pharrell is a Master of his craft. I’ve listened to his music since before I can remember and it’s always been perfect. With that said, some of these other artist could benefit greatly from his work.  I think Pharrell and Janet need a collaboration.  Just my opinion. ❤
🔥
This sounds so much like I wanna be your slave by Maneskin
genioooooos!!!!
Jane Fonda vibes❤
Does anyone else also hear the beat being super similar to Maneskin "I wanna be your slave"? Not that it's a unique one, but still...
Very Tina Turner vibe! 😍
Miley is giving me some serious Tina Turner vibes in this one!
Me gusta, música y video, se ve hermosa
Amooooo❤
I love this woman I had a dream I was with her it was like being in paradise ❤
I think that she finds her iconic self!
Queen has done it again
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Oh my God I love this song I just love Miley Cyrus and she's so talented she'll never lose that talent she's a fantastic songwriter performer she's absolutely amazing just keep writing your songs and making albums I can't afford concerts so it's fine with me
Sounds a lot like Maneskin song "I wanna be your slave" 🤔
MILEY YOU LOOK SO HAPPYY!!! <33<3 I LOVE IT!
What?
Another amazing song by Miley🎉🎉🎉
Who else hears Maneskin's "I Wanna Be Your Slave" at the beginning? Same beat, same context.
Nonono 😢
Let me work it out!!
❤❤❤
WOW, thats just sounds like a copy of maneskin - i wanna be your slave
Odeio o fato da Miley ser P E R F E I T A, e saber que eu nunca seria uma Miley na vida! Kkkk 😂❤ PODEROSA ! 🎉
She has never looked more beautiful. She is oozing with confidence and happiness. She has found herself and I’m here for it👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🥳
Sera que esse cabelo é mega her???
I knew she was plotting something with that Grammy look.
Hey hey hey hey~ Hey hey hey~ Hey hey hey~
Oi Miley quando vai fazer um feat com a Anitta???
O clip todo a Miley se sentindo! Adorei! 😂😂😂 Um banho de autoestima!
I’m a huge fan but this song is horrible
Quero ver o próximos gramy
Su peinado a la Jane Fonda le queda excelente. Se ve que se arregló los dientes superiores, igual se le veían bien cuando adolescente.
Old hair do got to go she's too young to wear precilla Presley hair do
Unofficial Tresemme shampoo ad😂
she looks gross
It could be an opening song for a romantic comedy movie when the hero is travelling from one city to another
https://youtu.be/nllM1S_-NRE?si=deJpRwk9sn379fWx😮
Imitating tina turner and kylie minogue and  stealing beats... i don't  see why you are all hyping her
reminds me of the chorus of the band Maneskin
Serving Tina Turner vibes.
My Queen Miley
I can be a porn star
She is THE Queen!
I am a straight old woman, but it is impossible to take eyes off of her! What a voice, what a perfect body, amazing eyes, what great moves. Total package! Miley could play white version of Tina Turner.
If you shoot this clip on site will be more better than this video dancing alone as many songs you did before.. as fan i want to see something NEW
Meh…
I like the Grown up Miley
Absolutely awesome ✨
A Scorpio moons best revenge is showing exactly what people don't have access to anymore. 😂❤
Amo sei bellissima però questo video non ci azzecca tanto, no sense.  Nel complesso sei una bona totale
This is literally Blurred Lines 😂
I like that she didn't had plastic surgerys like her boobs or her lips filled. She is authentic and beautiful, I like these new songs even better than before.
She is still beautifull as always
Wow, this woman dont exist. ❤❤❤❤ Kisses from Brasil.
Ela é sensacional e brilha mais a cada dia. 🌹🌹🌹
I love Miley like this. She is truly the best version of herself. It is amazing.
You are happy  l am happy too  she is my doctor.❤
Its so good to see her evolve a d reinvent herself!
She's one of the mainstream celebs I TRULY admire
She looks beautiful
Gaga vibes
Oooh good ❤
Es una señora grande en el cuerpo de una mujer joven😢
Love this , but @thalia did it first
Im tired of sheap miley’s music videos
I always thought Miley looked her best with long brown hair
So fun! I love it
Linda #Miley 😊 a bailar 💃🌹👏
Loving this vibe!!!! ❤
I'm so happy for her that she is now happier  She deserve all the love and Support. ❤
You are Amazing
WOW Miley you're amazing.. loving  your  style.   song  is def  you!!!! love it..
I'm still waiting for Farrell Williams 😂😂
Yo Miley, share your dentist's infos yeah?
Sarah G. is waving 😅😅😅 Looking forward for her performance on ASAP. 🙏❤️😊
Horrible lyrics.
Ella es única pero el cabello es orrendo su peinado no le queda
😍😍😍
A living legend
Miley missed the chance to dress up like a sexy doctor or a naughty nurse. Too bad...
ew why Pharrell Williams it could be anyone else but him funny a guy that was cancelled for misogyny is now collaborating with one of the faces of woman empowerment, stop giving second chances to people that should not be on the public eye
It definately has that "Happy Pharrell" vibe. LOve it! Miley is just shining!
I really don't like the mullet. It's just not flattering.  But I really love that she's been doing well! She looks like she had SO much fun making this video.
When the song started I was thining it's maneskin-I wanna be your slave just a pop version 🤣
Es una Diosa la amo ❤
LOVE. it!!!! ❤
Best benger in 2024 ..so far
This is song of the year 🙌🏽
❤❤❤❤❤
I hope that she's that happy also in her personal life ❤ stage animal! 🤩
Song still needs to grow on me
Miley, we all knew you would be this perfect artist. Finally!!!!
Feels super Burlesque. This is great. 👏🏾👏🏾
I love you Miley
Always u the best ❤
Nice 😍💖💖💖
shes a queen.
Great song but what's the reason for the awkward dancing? What does it represent?
I hope she will change the haircut soon. That one reminds me 60 years old Tina Turner.
Miley
Yes niley
Tina Turner vibes
Tina Turner vibe 🤩
we love it lol
My beat for the week❤ Baby lemme work you out😊
i love this video, it reminds me of something i can’t put my finger on though!! 80s vibes though!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 the beuty Girl!!!
Miley brilhando como nunca!
As much as I love her vibe and dancing I’d have loved to see her dressed in a slutty doctor outfit doing everything unprofessionally, using the tools all wrong, putting her lover in more danger in a lighthearted, silly colourful video  But this is ok too, I’ll take miley in any of her forms 😢
Ehh nothing beats 2013 lightskin Miley 😂🔥
LOVE YOU, MILEY!! THIS NEW SONG IS EVERYTHING! SO GOOD! 🎶♥♥♥😍😍😍
Sexy!
What talent? I hear and see none whatsoever. Please leave singing and dancing to professionals like your Dad.
te amo
thats what we call star quality
This song is giving me 2000s feel! I love it!
Luce feliz y empoderada🎉
Fame is created by media and not the same as talent.  She is really an artist .
Kkkkkkkkk she so crazy lol
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
She is the lioness queen
Yea she did that!!!!
Tina Turner vibes. Love it
Diva ❤
How Gorgeous, Beautiful, full of Talent, & Fun-Fun 😂Song!  Not boring at all like that Show off Taylor Swift!  Miley is 100% more beautiful & stylish, then Swift. Miley the bomb 💣 such a nice figure, best legs 🦵🏻🦵🏻 in the music business! 😮😊 Boy can she, sure dance & move that classy body!  Not a boring tall stick, like Taylor Swift! 😂
❤❤❤❤
Reminds me of Night Nurse by Gregory Isaac’s but in a modern Pop way
❤
SHE IS DOLLY PARTONS GRAND DAUGHTER.. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT SURPRISING..❤
First Miley song I don’t like.
I love
Wow ❤
Неперевершана❤❤❤🎉
Love this❤❤❤amazing
Miley❤ la mujer más hermosa que nunca y libre de ser ella 😍 ella nació para ser estrella 💫
Miley didn't sell her soul to the devil there's no comparison when emotions are free of guilt🤟
Omg she did that hairstyle again lol
am I the only one who listens a little bit off to Måneskin in the part "I can be your doctor I can be your nurse"?
😻
She is lot better than TS!
Sobriety looks good on you, Miley, & your voice is back! Healthy, happy, in top form, and always talented! ✌🏼♥️
It looks like an episode of SNL
awww she looks so happy and content with her work 🥰
Amazing ❤
Thats horrible
Call me tracey
Miley❤
She is my life
She seems to only have one style of dress in her wardrobe…😂😂😂 and the hair in never coming back but I love the song…
Se parece a Tina Turner 😎
Ridicule
a dentadura de azulejo
Wooooow!
SHE is at her best❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Im loving this Miley.
Britney Spears does the same and she crazy. Ok. Britney walked so Miley could run.
I was expecting to hear Pharrell. Good song though
Where is Pharrell Williams? 👁️💋👁️
💎💰💯🙏❤️
Y pharrell Williams 😤🤯🤯🤯😤😤
She is beautiful! Love this Tina Turner phase. She is really at her peak.
Her body🔥🔥🔥
What breath or fresh air 😌
She works out
I was hoping pharrell would also sing it this.. 😢 but I get it
Tina like this
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
My daughter was obsessed w/Hanna Montana but this kid aggravated me to no end man! Then she was all over the internet & singlehandedly made “twerking” a household word & acceptable (but I won’t even get into that bullsh*t). However, “Flowers” & “Doctor” are AMAZING…she nailed the music, the aesthetic is GIVING & I even like the lil choreography here & there! Whoever produced/contributed to the songs did the damn thang…Miley my dear, you have a new fan in this Millenial momma!!!💜💜💜
Her body is TEA! This woman is amazing
Miley is THE ICONIC you'll ever come across with ❤
❤️❤️❤️❣️🥰
Was she on rupauls drag race?
I have not seen her in such a long time . She looks so different to me... I use to love  watching Hannah Montana lol
Looks like Cher and Tina turner
❤️
There’s only one Tina RIP🤍
Super talented and a beautiful woman.
Never been so excited
❤
Love to see her happy and healthy… ❤️❤️but that hair… i was hoping it was a Grammy’s only miss 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
When she says "Let me work it out", it reminds me of INXS. There's a line where Michael Hutchens sings "Can't think at all"
a true star, ladiend and gentles
Shotout❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Sending love❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ì have this on repeat all day just love Miley❤❤❤
Love the energy!
Miley Cyrus has become the modern-day, white, Tina Turner
I’m feeling this song. She feels happier, you see it. Now I see why she wore what she wore at the Grammy’s, she’s into the Tina Turner look. 👏👏👏👏
I don't feel this 😏
Great performance. I like it. Bravo. Thank you 👍👌💯💯💯❤️❤️🌹
love you
nice! go miley!
It's not a hit.
fun fact: 3 cans of hair spray were needed to do her hair.
Pharell really made this song pop Miley is growing up !!
Just an amazing and marvelous video 👍🏼
Miley ate it 🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤
❤️Ella y su inagotable talento, no hace falta nada más❤️
Feelin it!!
WHAT A QUEEN!!! How did she not get a grammy until recently???
Amazing, but where is Pharrell?🤔 did I miss something...?
Love her newest Miley. 🎉
She is SO MUCH BETTER than... the one who keeps showing up at football games.
I love you Miley ❤
OK, she is very good, but I think" a part her carries "every artist has given the best of himself in the life; who in a way, who in another so the right talent dipend what it can to make by the same hands and right creativity. She comes from a artist's family so she is really good like singer because I listened some songs of her but it's also true that she, like all these artists, her fame has grown with her image, her body, and her beautiness. Ehi people!! However I've told you these things not for diminish or degrade her;  she is good because she is really full of inventive and all this one makes go up her quotation too. 🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎶🎶🎶🎶1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍
We literally grew up with miley ❤
Miley is amazing!
Happy for you
Any Liz fans here?
hmmmmmmmmmmm miley??????????? hhaha ILYYYYYYYYY QUEENNNNNNNNNNNN <3
Musically, I'm not connecting with this at all.
girl, miley, my girl, how you do that o_______o a cat lady dance, can someone please coin that dance NOW
She is happy and having tons of fun
Son espectaculares 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
the song is lame and she looks like she's 50
no. fucking. way.
Where is Pharrell 🤔
Wauu!! ❤
Go watch 'Do it' ... alot camera on her lip licking
Another Grammy ❤ coming
Beyoncé?
Love It 🔥
I can envision Pamela making a workout to this song
Listening is better than watching in this case
Yessssssss ❤❤❤❤
Good song but am i the only one who finds it similar to the song Maneskin - I Wanna Be Your Slave?
Damn miley 's back
Cuerpazo, caraza, piernazaaaaaas! Hermosa niña ❤
Queen ❤👑👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Como se va a dañar el cuerpo con ese montón de tatuaje, como es de linda. Así se ve como una grilla de barrio. pero su talento artistico es increible
I get nervous, everytime Miley collaborates with one of the Blurred Lines guys 😰
That intro part sounds VERY familiar...perhaps a sample? Someone help me out pls
Why she lookin like Beyoncé??
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Should have 10M by now
Me encantó la felicidad que transmite y la buena vibra.
loved the song and video. Our queen Miley :)
That’s a lot of hair extensions
I watched the video in slow motion, but no sign of Pharrell Williams. I’ll try zooming in on Miley’s hair, hoping to find him.
Awesome song. Miley you are a wonderful singer and you still have more time to do many new and fantastic songs. You deserved those Grammy's. I am sure there will be many more if you keep putting out great songs like this. You go girl!!!!!
cool
Im so glad she doesn't get butt and breast implants... She works out to look good...no cheating. All those women that get implants will regret when they hit 50 years old...too much weight ..some cant even perform like they use to at 40 or 50.  And that is still young if you stay in shape and exercise... Stop with the implants.
They could never make me hate you
I look at Miley and I want veneers too 😂
What does this song have to do with Pharrell? It's only Miley in it...am I missing something?
Trendsetter 🖤
E esse cabelo anos 80????❤❤❤❤❤
Eres la leche maja!!! K gustazo verte..oírte   y sentirte!¡❤
Dumb song  But she’s good
She said she'd never fix her overlapped tooth 🕵🏻‍♀️
She is giving Ann Margaret  vibes
Positif vibes ❤❤❤❤❤
robin thicke blurred lines vibes 😂 It's wonderful to see how much fun and joy Miley is currently having.
We love you Miley ❤
Hair🎉
Miley nunca decepciona. ❤❤
More love to Miley Cyrus ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Reinaaaa
Nice❤
This is who we need to watch and uplift. Go girl !
She looks dirty with those random tattoos on her.
Sounds like Maneskin "I wanna be your slave" to me 🤔

Miley is that girl who isn't cute, but tries so hard to be in the pretty girls club.  She does this by wearing skimpy clothing and having a "anything goes" attitude.  Keep trying girl.

You are the light itself Smiley 👑
Bravooooo mileyyy ahhhhh!!! Inlove this sht ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I Wanna Be Your Slave by Maneskin vibes
Que lindaaaaaa.. que majestoso ver ela feliz, livre e solta, a de amo
She was born to perform. Her stage presence is just too 🔥 🔥 🔥
Anyone here after finding out that this was actually released after 12 years
María Mercedes vibes…BIG TIME!!!
this is music for people that dont like music
Nossa ela está linda, e o estilo maravilhoso
Hi! My baby I miss U so Mach I ❤U! John ling! Happy Valentine's Day! 🤗😋😘😍😜🥰🤫🥱😴💓💞💝💘💖♥️
she needs to change her hairstyle...
I don't get why she thinks this hairstyle looks good but besides that love the Vid, love the music and of course Miley is the Queen❤
The moves is so very Ga-Ga.😆
Real singing, great voice and a hit song. Not fond of these current extremely successful talkers/whisperers. Give me a real talented SINGER like Miley any day over them. Keep them coming Miley! Loved it!
Хотелось бы слышать больше рока от Майли! 🔥
It's like a Jane Fonda and Tina Turner fine blend. Beautiful! 🎉
Ya se me pego esta canción 🎉 y yo solo quiero saber cuántos años,entrenamiento y método alimenticio lleva para estar así de fantástica ❤❤
DIVA POP
Awesome! She looks a bit like a young Jane Fonda.
Music is back ❤
Pharrell Williams in 2024?
Cool Miley
After years, she's still herself❤❤❤❤❤ love that energy🎉
Ok but where’s Pharrell 🧐
Na pierwszy odsłuch - to nie jest to dla mnie szczytowe osiągnięcie. Ale Miley wygląda prześlicznie i fajnie że jest teledysk. Po prostu Fajnie Dziewczyno śpiewasz i wyglądasz❤
This is camp af and I’m here for it. Miley is such a Queen.
She took that Tina Turner inspiration and hit a home run with it!
The hair reminds me of George Washington and the moves ain't it 😂
que le ha pasado en el pelo? Volvió Hanna Montana
Miley has the Midas touch. Everything is pure gold. She looks amazing and is turning out one great song after another.
Maravilhosaaaa❤
Phaarrrreeelll Wiillllllliaaaammss
In short- Miley can pose and dance. However, she doesn't have much vocal range.
Where is a Pharell?
Como é bom ver a Miley feliz genuinamente ❤
Love this one Great singer
Super
Lips and "ahh" are straight from Kylie Minogues and Robbie Williams MV 😂
Your need a better coreographer xD Stealing from Jena Ortega? xD Holy F....
I am actually waiting for Pharell Williams to show on the video😅
Not 2 chanche  miley  ❤
💗
As if I wasn't already obsessed with miley ugghh 😍🥰❤️
👩🏼‍⚕️Doctor Cyrus
I luv this dress and style and makeup 😮😊 WOW that’s SO BEAUTIFUL 🤩 😮😮 (my mom could luv this. #LOL) 😘
I ❤ It!!!!
❤❤❤😍
It was 818 when I finished watching this video. Tell me that isn’t exactly what this video exudes❣️
Love the Pharrell’s part !

Miley is the shit
Giving me Maneskin - I wanna be your slave vibes
In this video She reminds me Danii Minogue
I LOVE THIS WOMAN OMG
It seems like you're having so much fun while filming!!! I love it! I want to have the body like yours - strong and beautiful!
Will never top the revolution that was "we can't stop" and "wrecking ball" when dropped 10 years ago. This is a solid banger but need some familiar music stars to come out with timeless hits and change the landscape of music for a while.
She looks like she's having so much fun ❤😊
Nossa ia amar um feat dela com o Troye Sivan de drag 😂
She is to me the most charismatic of all female singers in the scene nowadays and damn she looks stunning. That hair , that statuesque body …. No fat ass, no huge breasts … she is model material. Love her ❤
Next song for my fitness class - they not gone like me 😂 this was great and she looks amazing!!!
grocery shopping music
she's so beautiful
❤mira se te ve bellísima encanta tu voz tus movimientos están 2:23  perfectos y  la música genial el cor celeste te queda espectacular va con tus ojos hermosos❤
The most cheapest MV
Це реально схоже на Maneskin😮
She's just WOW!❤
D I V A 🇧🇷❤️
Hair is giving sindel with a serving of popstar
I love Miley Cyrus❤❤ I don't care what she sings I just love her
4.302
Dope
Def giving tina turner
I'm speechless....1💋
Yessss🔥🔥🔥motherrr
ENTREGOU TUDOOOII!!!
I feel a duet with Beyonce coming on! This is a good dancy number, better than the original version of this song. She is reallt begining to be the twin of her mother. Looking better with age Miley. X
Terrible. Not that i expected it to be anything other than bad
Uhhhh.....😚 i love it ❤❤❤
Tina Turner?
I love seeing this side of Miley she's so happy and beautiful ❤
Te amo reina hermosa ❤ sos maravillosa
Esta mujer se supera a sí misma cada día! Y que brazotes ❤
A bit of Tina+jane Fonda+ Maneskin (i can be your slave)=  miley cirus explosion!
"She possesses an innate elegance, with a talent that transcends the ordinary. Her singing is a symphony of beauty and grace, leaving an indelible impression of awe and admiration."
She looks old
Me encanta tu video❤
Super bueno❤
So proud of you Hannah Montana
🕺
Soft porn
So positive, fun song ❤ She’s a Queen ❤
Y pharrel no canta o que?
Sound like garbage
ILove it
We will all remember this outfit as: The Grammy outfit. 😍❤️ my Divine. and spectacular video. wonderful Miley
How did Pharrell Williams contribute to this music video?
Throwing back to the Robin Thicke days! That Pharrell groove is unmistakable
But how divine this woman is. Every day I love all this talent that he shows more. definitely the best.
Fake😂Teeth
Excelente cantante bella mujer!Mejor aptitud seguridad en sí misma ! I love You ! 😍🥳💃❤️
Where is Pharell?
Where is Pharrell?
Love the “Big Hair” I hope big hair is making a come back!!
A very confident lady who knows what she wants in life ❤
Why is it giving “single ladies” ?
Nossa lembrou muito a Tina Turner, será que ela pode seguir os passou dela, potencial ela tem, não para substituir mas sim para seguir os passos da Rainha do Rock. A Miley é muito talentosa, aprendi a gostar dela depois do álbum Plastic Hurts, ela tem uma voz muito boa e muito talento no palco
The song is great, but I feel like im watching a dentist commercial 😂😂
Smiley Miley❤🇮🇳
The perfect singer
Work it miley
A lot of Blurred lines and Mona Lisa vibes
❤
She's got a Tina Turner vibe to her look in this one. She looks fantastic
why does it sound and look like "Blurred Lines"
Che talento la Miley meravigliosa!!! Mi piacerebbe di più con il colore dei capelli biondi chiari le sta molto bene!!! 👍👍👍👍📣📣🎶🎼🎤🌴🍷🙏💃💃💃💃
❤❤❤❤
Giving a bit of Tina Turner vibes with style - love it
she looks now the best she's ever looked
her smile is EVERYTHING
Tan retro y vintage que copia a artistas mujeres
Looks like a toothpaste ad
Did Måneskin write the lyrics?
This is so Tina Turner 😂
You shine the way you are
Want the name of her dentist.
Starts like Maneskin ❤❤❤
Icônica 🇧🇷
Def capitalizing in the hair and dress from the Grammys, but female independence from men and self care  is way more empowering and sexy than a Slut Strut. 😮
She's clearly gifted and sensational. I believe she and Lady Gaga and Beyonce deserve true attention. They have absolutely great amount of talent, presence on stage, have esthetic body movements, they take performances to another level. They have voice and don't just rap on music, when they sing, you feel melody and that is what music should be about: sounds. And Miley started reinventing herself so very well.  She really deserves  appreciation, she is a natural talent, not a forced one. It's easier to like her,  she is better than other artists who have greater fame and success than her.
Hermosa por dentro y por fuera. Mujer admirable
❤Absolute Amazin🎉
Oh my god 😮❤
She is eternally hott😮. I love how it feels like she is channeling Tina Turner💖
Legal
Thank you miley 😭😭😭
Miley out here SLAYINNNNN!!! Love this music and her vintage looking style!! Been standing her for many years and that is one decision I will NEVER regret!!  Commented on 3 March 2024, 7:34 PM
❤❤❤❤
Paul Harrell and everyone around him off
She's dancing like Tina Turner
*Nie chce nic mowic ale to wlasnie wy nakrecacie celebrytow ktorzy kupuja lajki na Realfollow*
Zastanawia mnie co ludzie widza w tym calym realfollow .. No bo fakt, moze i celebryci i te super wielkie gwiazdy tam kupuja, ale co z tego? Jak to ktos zweryfikuje? Co to zmieni? Oswieci mnie ktos?
I don’t know she is trying to be like Tina but it don’t work for me. As long as miley is happy 🫶
Drop that workout routine Queen  💅
It has the same vibe as Måneskin song "I Wanna Be Your Slave"... 🤔
All I can see are her mouth and teeth
Doctor Cyrus  After giving us flowers you now give us medications thanks 🤲🏾
She knows she can be herself without a man judging her constantly
I can literally feel the joy in this video. Love me some Miley! ❤️
She's clearly having genuine fun in this clip, and it makes me so happy seeing her like that.
Wheres pharrell?
Where is pharell
Love it❤❤❤
D I V A
😍😍😍
❤❤❤ This is her time ❤️❤️❤️✨
Que le devuelva la canción a Maneskin
Absolutely primitive…
🫨🫨🫨
❤❤❤
Miley is a wonderful artist! Always beautiful and very self-confident!
🎉 Yes!
Maria la del barrio en el 2024. Thalía la doctora gringa 😂
She's pure talent
Okay, the song is good but are we going to ignore that Miley is still marketed like industry plant 20 years in her career? She's ripping Tina Turner's brand: funky sound, stage presence, and even the outfit. She started emulating Tina Turner vibes in the Grammys and still continues to this song. I wonder if she will stick to this image through this upcoming album promotion. It's uncanny for her to imitate Tina Turner. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Where is Pharrell Williams?
Nah man that's not miley
She suddenly developed a super skinny face and huge teeth. And she's not  even old yet.
I was waiting to see Pharrell on the video
Iike it
Miley is a super talent , she is something special. ✨️☀️🥇💐
Dumb stupid lyrics
It's giving Francesco Scavullo Cosmopolitan cover photo shoot.
what a thriller
Hi beautiful Miley Cyrus You just perfect my dream Girl my badest ❤❤❤ 🎉🎉🎉
Dolly P.
Love me some Miley. The Disco vibes are on point.❤🎉
Maneskin wanna be
She’s growing & glowing.❤ I like her new look lol. It’s giving Tina turner.
🥳 Hell of a good song.🎉
That song is someting betweeen Maneskin and Dadi Freyr 🤨.
I'm not loving this new hairstyle..😅 but ok good for her
❤❤❤
Its a solid song. I like Flowers more but...Some parts before the chorus reminds me at Maneskin - i wanna be your slave...
Me ENCANTA ❤
If your here in 2090  I was here in 2024, young and happy like you, but you will die like me too😢
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳
Miley pazzesca 😮❤❤❤
This is about as stupid as it gets. Such a waste of god given talent.
Free Palestine
Wow I love the song Miley has the best voice ever
where pharel ???????????
Her lips got me.....I'm a  woman, I swr I felt something 😅
Miley is fantastic.. Her Vocals And Energy, Sexy, Classy , Pristine❤ she like Cher, Madonna, Tina Turner, Dolly etc. Watched/Grew up with them all. She has sang with so many great artists she holds her own❤❤.
She looks good  happy and free nt gonna lie❤
I dont like miley.
Not a great song but nice to see her happy
❤❤❤
she is soo thin....... anyway
Stunning beautiful sexy and very desirable miley has to be the sexiest woman living today
Miley in a Tina’s style.. beautiful
What's with the 80's hair? Lolllllll
horrible outfits and song
Guauuuuu, cómo siempre me encanta ❤❤
Like a bad version of Beyonce work it out
Gain some weight
Her face isn't aging well
She issa vibe 🫠🔥
Anyone else think it sounds so similar to Maneskin's I wanna be your slave? https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=8gSB1WMUQy4DtuOM
I was waiting to hear pharrel come on and sing!
She's gorgeous and the song n video are so fun! Loves it 🥺
Pop is back ....nice Miley
Me has cautivado con Flowers🎉 y aquí estoy. Un fuerte abrazo desde Barcelona (España).❤
Just terrible.maybe the worst lyrics ever in history of music.the very music also next to worst ever.i am surprised they have released this.and dancing is awkward
i really like the pharrell parts 😃😃😃
😍😍😍
this hair???  looks like a lions mane!  ugh
That is dance? Handwork is silly!
Pharrell Williams = brilliant. Miley Cyrus = awesome .
She looks manly, but with plumped lip injections, cheek reduction and tattoos singing avout being a flusey. Like what does her dad have to say about this. I think she was way better and better looking back in the days before she became a flusey dancing on a pole at a childrens concert. Her parents really should have punished her, and they definitly need to now. It's like she's trying to embarrass her family at every turn, and at every turn finds another opportunity to sing about being a hussy which will only make guys want to sleep with her more..But she wants the attention so be it. That's what she will get, but keep in mind.. >Not all attention is good attention. She lost me as a fan. Really she should give up her career, honestly as far as im concerned her carreer was up long ago after the pole thing and definitely when she disappeared for years.
She doesn't need anyone else to shine
Strong woman
🎉Love this kinda 80’s but Miley flavor touch!🤩💕And she' looks stunning!😳✨
Girl we need more music, this is era is everything!!!
The dress..the mv...the girl. 💜💜💜💜
she's literally the best
What was Pharrell's part in this?
Great song but worst hairstyle ever 😅
Pharrell never misses that 4 beat intro never fails
Best version of herself. TRUE to herself and her art..."Work it out"
At Least she dressed better
Love it .❤
Tina Turner 5.0 ❤
Ouch ...
Madonna worked out hard too and look at her now. Miley cyrus will get worn out too what she and all of you need is truth in Jesus Christ to be your Savior and Lord cuz serving satan will get you nothing but bitterness and a gulf of misery. It all looks shiney and endless ornaments gallore but the gore, vimit dung and bloody guts are lurking behind the smoke and and mirrors.  A discerning child of God can see the demons infest this wonton woman . She needs to repent and turn to the the Most High God in obedience and praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen
What’s inside of TRUMP’S BRAIN?!?! Well, I don’t know! But I hope, it’s not, CAKE!!! I swear, if it’s cake, I am so… DONE!!!
Rockstar 2.0
I didn't see or hear Pharrell.
jujur aku gak suka produk dari pharrell
What’s in sweet corn?! Well, I actually don’t know! It better be corn, or I swear, TO GOD!!! If it’s actually cake, I am going to throw myself OUT THE WINDOW!!!
did she come directly from grammys to shoot this

🎶 Sex-Kitten Ann-Margret vibes… it would have really killed if the new hair color would have been red and of Ann’s style in that era.  I think the hairstylists for her Grammy appearance and this video rely on way too much hairspray on the top… it doesn’t move or flow well at all for dance songs, plus looks kinda like a wig.  If the hair curled, set and blown out properly, it would move naturally then return to its styled shape… just observing her new look, and just an opinion… like assholes; everyone has one 😉☮️
Shes giving Tina Turner with some  80’s Dynasty hair and I like it!
Por que me recuerda a Beyoncé Tina Madonna haga cher no se TE AMO MILEY
Love her !! She is her mama’s twin too :)
Shes so rockin the 80s hair
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maneskin vibes
A chart-topping contender if it’s not already #1!
Miley has found herself I think.  Funny, silly and SEXY.  I love this Miley, Keep it up.
🎉
Runs over and big hugz then step back, look and smile. ☝💪👍✌
Release cant stay f u forver pls
Tina Turner/Jane Fonda vibes
Miley this the baddest production you've ever had , stupid song
Miley looks genuinely happy in this era. Giving such disco diva vibes!!! 🎉
You are gorgeous
She's went from a catapillar to a beautiful butterfly.. She's absolutely beautiful I can't get over how mature and somewhat sophisticated she seems and I love her hair and make up.. She's scrumptious and I never cared much for her since Hannah Montana but.. We all have our stages we go thru and she's going through hers and I love it!!! Go sister!!!❤❤❤
Queen❤️
Is this country?
She’s the happiest and most confident I’ve seen in a while and I’m here for it. Go Miley!!
Lemme Work it out 🎉❤

❤❤❤
Is this part one of the real song??? Don't waste my dam time. Miley, do better! ❤❤❤
Sexy version!!
Pharrell really knows how to produce a banger! Those strings strumming are hypnotizing!😵‍💫
Superb performance and song ❤
She's so vulgar
Sorry but the Tats just don't work with that gorgeous dress...come on Ladies 😮LADIES
I love this song this video and this whole new Miley!
Have a good new song❤❤❤
Am I the only one who gets grown up “Hannah Montana Meets Miley Cyrus” vibes from this song?  I’ve grown up with her and this song just takes me back to early Miley while staying up to date and mature. 😍
Rocking hard
Fricken fabulous….. I love it.. Tina turner vibes and the gay boys will go. Off
I am obsessed with this! GO MILEY!!!!
She is so refreshing
yess mmmaaaaaaaammm!
Miley’s wig is wild 😮
You’re the number 1 queen
I love you Miley
You’re the best Miley
Si está canción no sale en Grey's Anatomy no quiero nada
❤😊
I liked her better with her round face and her tiny teeth 😢❤
I love everything about this.
She certainly looks great but this song is garbage.  What a stupid song.
Let’s hope the radio doesn’t ruin this song!
Blue fur coat 😍😍
I love how much FUN she's having
Wow
bop
She ate as always
Muito boa essa pegada Mia collucci nos anos 80 ❤🎉
So this the new Britney huh
She looks so gorgeous in this. Nice track!
Miley Rocks
1000 ey
She good 🔥
Where are..... Miley's real FANS from her debut to today.( Amazingly and beautiful song....like Miley)
this sounds like a bangerz scrapped song, i know it is, but it should’ve remained in the b-side!!
Красотка! Обожаю Майли🥰🥰🥰
Awesome groove 🎉
She looks so healthy and wealthy.
How is is this not number one music video on youtube? Right now
This isn't even music
is it miley signature dence now?
I feel like she might have too many teeth in her mouth they just don’t seem to fit. 🤷🏽‍♂️ the song is just OK but she looks beautiful..
Miley
پرفکت
She looks so damn amazing and she looks so happy
E pensar que esse clipe passa no mundo todo 😑😮 .
I love that she is having so much fun doing what she loves!! I love her soo much!! 🩷
Tina Turner inspiration! Let everyone know! 💕
This song was actually recorded 12 years ago for her “Bangerz” Album, but it didn’t make the cut.  Miley & Pharrell didn’t think it would’ve been received too well back then. However, as fate would have it, they started talking about releasing it soon at this year’s Grammys!  As a result, we now  have it! Although  I still need to spend a little more time with it…to decide whether I Like it, or Love it… I think she looks beautiful, sexy & truly happy in the music video! She is having a blast!  Whether I like it, or love it…I’m very happy for either way!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Demasiado Hermosaaaaaa 😍. Ella nació para ser una estrella en todo su esplendor!!
Love the hair
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Miley is an ICON
Sweet, Beautiful 😍❤️ Miley Smiley!!!! You GLOW 🌟, Girl!!!!  I know your "Aunt" Dolly Parton is so proud 😍🦚 of you!!!! ❤️ 😜😻 😉 🔥
Im so proud of Miley. She’s been getting better with herself and having fun and not caring what anybody thinks. What a queen. I’m so proud of you Miley ❤
Butterfly fly away
Miley entregando mais um hit e mais dinheiro no bolso dela😅.
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Only 1 Tina turner
Va creciendo como la espuma, Hanna …. Quedó ya muy atrás, incluso la antigua Miley también! Bravo!!! Ahora tiene fans cincuentones, como yo!
Smiler hereeeeee 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You can't lose lil mama
The close-up mouth is such a throwback to what what in the butt
Confident queen ❤🎉
Hate this era
Jamesi say's HiHi to the Lovely MyCi ♥️  Great Job 👌✌️
Truly inspiring
Super cool!!❤
Prácticamente nos anuncio su disco  en los gramys y nadie se dio cuenta.

❤❤❤❤
So happy for youu
Miley
I love this for her ❤
Perfect ❤
Miley and selena proving it gets better after 30!!! My girls!
Se parece mucho a su mamá aquí
Reminds "I Wanna Be Your Slave" by Maneskin
Her voice matches with those instruments perfectly, why did she choose to do a video with only her in it? The problem with these artists of today is they want everyone to see them, that's not it, that's not the winning formula, you narrate a story and stay in the background, exercise discretion of your presence, and you don't matter, your work does. Always let your work outshine you. These guys got it so wrong. You know who is a master of my point Ye. He is the most talked about guy who goes above and beyond not to be seen. Ye's album went #1 upon releaser and the only thing he's shown anyone prior to it's release is his girlfriend, you can say Vultures is her album, artists narrate  stories like Hitchcock
Another hit for Miley. That dance though! It’s cute 🙃
I literally love it
As far as the song goes…I’m gonna need to spend some listening to it…Then decide whether I like it, or love it!  As far as Miley in the Video…She could never go wrong! She’s beautiful, sexy & she does look truly happy!
Esa pizca de Tina Turner le sienta bien👍
She looked gorgeous! I love tjis version of her but that was the worst mysic video Ive ever seen in my life.
we love herrrr
Notaron algo raro en el paladar de Miley?
Been great from day one. Miley in her prime now. Love it!
Iconicooo
I loveeeee it. She’s in her golden era
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
it sounds really similar to that maneskin song
❤❤❤❤
Love it
No me gustan los estilos reciclados, fuera de eso es muy funky, la veo en remixes en clubes, es bastante catchy
BEYOND BANGERZ CODED. Obsessed
Miley is at her best when collaring Pharrell, Mike Will or Mark Ronson
truth has been said this day, glorious simple direct truth.
Okkkkkkkk Miley!!!! I like this right here the beat is catchy as hell n u was feeling yourself love it was ius you with alll that spice !! My only critique is why they do your hair like that  curled back that was a noooooo.......
Love love love her❤
Imparable!!
Miley

A Disney star, and now in the adult world, is doing really well. her music is contagious.
Copy & paste song😂😂😂
Miley has become the best version of herself lately.
I don't know. Personally I believe that this artist has an international appeal and the music certainly speaks for itself. I think that her raunchy approach to the video is suitable for adults and I just think that to bring it all together the arms and the tattoos have to go. I I feel insulted by the lack of money into those tattoos. They seem childish cheap and they take away her beauty. Am I a Miley Cyrus fan the artist, the singer, the stage performer. Yes!
tina turner vibes?
Proud of her Grammy ❤
Congratulations.  Winner The British Music Awards ❤❤❤❤
Te adoro miley ❤
She looks amazing outfit body alll…but she definitely needs to get rid of that hairstyle pls
Hermosaaa, ❤❤❤❤
Miley is starting to release mainstream music, Selena is too, now all we need to do is wait for Demi
better than swift any day!
Amo esta mujer no solo por quien nos a enseñado Sido que en todo proceso nos enseñó algo importante que apresar de todo se puede salir de donde estamos y brillar más que nunca me encantó en cada proceso pero este me hizo enamorarme y querer más de ella felicidades hermosa
María Mercedes ❤

3.961
I knew that this was going to be her year keep going with your bad self ❤❤❤
This woman is a star! Musically she has been everywhere and done everything. I love the constant way she reinvents herself for herself. Her no apologies attitude for being her is amazing. She is beautiful. Love the Tina Turner vibes. Like Miley or not she is kind of contagious.
Doctor fans don't miss the reward of eternal life.  All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. Proverbs 7:22,23 Rejecting God/Jesus as savior will cost you your life and eternal place in heaven. Jesus died 4 you believe & repent.
Miley has become the best version of herself lately.
Beautiful 💕💕💕
Is Miley bringing back 80s pop? Cuz it feels like it, and i am Here for it!!!
Love love love this song already! Great vibe!
Miley is Madonna, Dolly and Joan Jett rolled into one. Let the greats keep rolling!!!

Jesus Christ died for our sins was buried and rose again the third day. I hope all who reads this will realize your a sinner (we all are) and turn to Jesus and trust and believe that He died for your sins was buried and rose again the third day but trust in Him alone to save you from your sins and hell.
That dress so Tina Turner and Cher from the 70s

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There is something different about Miley as of late & I like it. She is in her grown woman era?!?!
Hmm It's giving Miss Tina Turner ... it's giving Beyonce ... I'ma let her cook tho cus I still play my Bangerz album to this day ...So I wanna see where this genre is going.
The confidence, the contagious smile, my god she’s gorgeous. Literally one of the most versatile and creative artists of these last 15 years, she served every era and is still going.
Mi favorita 🤗lo mejor del gremy 😘bendiciones 🙏 hermosa 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love this version of Miley. I just don’t understand the hair.😂 and I’m an 80s person so that’s strange. She almost got it right if that’s what she was going for anyway, I love her she’s beautiful no matter what she’s wearing or how her hair looks. I love her music  now that she’s an adult.
Pharrell has produced another ICONIC song! 🥰💥 His genius knows no bounds. And, hot damn, Miley! She delivers in so many ways... AGAIN. 💥🥰💜 Thank you, both.
Absolutely love this. Goooo Miley.❤❤❤❤
Miley is a hot great musical singer that has a great voice. She can do what she wants a it will be great.. .

Miley Cyrus es capaz de hacer esto?! Después delos grammy 2024 soy más fan de ella !!!!!
🎉❤I love it!!
love this!!!!
❤️🥹❤️
Absolutely love this. Miley looks gorgeous ❤️
She needs to eat
Me encantó esta canción, siempre hermosa Miley!! 🫶🏻💕
😅no es tan grande pero el look de tina thorner le va muy bien 😊
I love you Miley❤
this is beautiful and you are beautiful 😯
Everything is perfect!!!
im getting a britney spears/tina turner vibe here... i like it, best version of you miley
AMOOOO quero ser assim quando eu crescer
She's back with brown long hair 😮miss them so beautiful suit her very well
The coda of the lyrics in the chorus (?) put me in mind of Anywhere Is by Enya
PERFEITA 😍
Imagina ser assim, pqp
You go girlll!!!❤❤❤❤❤
That dance she did when she first said “work it out” had me laughing lol
OMG!! THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! SUCH A CONFIDENCE AND WELL BEING!! YOU DESERVE IT, SMILEY <3!!!
She has gotten  so tone. She kinda  reminds  me of Tina  Turner. You know how toned her legs were I mean Tina  was known  for  her  legs.
Imagine how many mixes with that✌️💚😎🌺
She stole a song from måneskin "I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE", just listen, exactly😱
Pretty nice song best wishes to Miley Cyrus going forward
Looking gorgeous, Miley, though this song started out sounding rather like a Pharrell hit, but he’s not in it. Is he just the producer? If so, why is his name first on the song? Is that common? 🤔  Love her look, style, & sound overall lately, though this song isn’t my top (lyrics are fun, but melody is a bit 🤷🏻‍♀️) but I adore how *free* she seems to feel, uninhibited but not for attention (like in her early “rebellion” days). So happy for this woman, she seems like a lot of fun performing live, too. 🤍
Miley is becoming THE diva. Giving Mariah Carey and Tina Turner kinda mix vibe I LOVE IT
WTF
Looks like Jane Fonda in Barbarella (Google if ya too young)
😍
O estilo do vídeo me dando uma extrema nostalgia dos clipes feitos em quadros de diferentes cores.... AMEI
Doctor psiquiatra whoooo?
O carisma dessa mulher é... incomparável!!!  SOU APAIXONADA
Kidz Bop ass lyrics.  Laughable
Arrasou mana

Love her! but I just dont like this song.. its actually awfull..   more songs like Slide Away.. please
This is amazing!!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Ok, I definitely like where she´s going!!! Go girl!!!!
She works hard to look ugly. Man it takes a lot of drugs and vulgarity to ruin her beauty.
New álbum please ❤❤❤
She's just shining! I love it. She looks more beautiful and strong than ever before 🔥❤😍🍀
I love it, i feel the life sonrisa by sonrisa
Beautiful and confirmed.
Another love doctor🥰🥰
Great piece of music!!!!
I am LOVING the southern drag queen look on her 😍
Why is no one talking about how cringe this is? The hair, the dancing and the lyrics of this ridiculous song!!
She looks so purely HAPPY in this, that's the greatest part, it shines throughout the video
❤❤❤❤❤
I so love you beautiful Miley Cyrus ❤️❤️❤️🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🌹🌹🌹🌹❣️❣️❣️🫶🏻🫶🏻🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩 you look so amazing and great and so dam cute 🥰🥰🥰❣️❣️❣️🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹😍🤩🥰 I love your music 😍🎶❤️🫶🏻❣️🤩🥰😍☺️😏😏😉😉🎶
Not the biggest fan of the song  But I’ll watch the video multiple times just to see her so happy and confident. Loving it. It makes me feel so warm inside ❤
Miley Cyrus doesnt disappoint as always in music.. ❤❤.. But where pharell in there??
Been following her childhood and she keeps getting better. Miley is here to stay!!! This is the jam
She is disgusting
Is she planning on making a new album?
not my fav from miley
✨💃🏼✨💃🏼✨
👍🏻🩵✨🩷🎶
Listened to this like 50 times today lmao. Having this played at my funeral 😂😂
100% Blurred Lines vibes ❤
Cant' stop watching at her since Grammys😯 she is hipnotizing, didn't seen this ever before. Go Miley!
Yes!!!! This is good!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Why is Pharrell’s name on this song/video?
1:21 una Britney Spears empoderada nadie la derriba guau guau guau 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤ ella es única i tanlentosa por eso la amo mucho 😮🤯💯🎊
I BET LIAM IS STILL KICKING HIMSELF IN THE ASS, FOR LETTING HER GO.... SHE COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DOCTOR OR NURSE...😂😂😂😂😂
Qué bonita canción
Sounds familiar
Where is pharell?
🔥🔥
Hannah Montana 🔥♥️
Miley you look incredible ❤
No Soy Fan de Miley Pero Me Gustan Varias De Sus Canciones... Entre Ellas Flower y Está Me Encantó Tambien!! 🎉 Super Pegajosa!!🎉🎉
She's serving versatility and confidence cause she knows she can be a doctor and a nurse. Shine bright like that gorg and bold ouftit, baby, cause we're all here to watch.
Yet another song to get extremely sick of being overplayed on the radio
Love ❤
Am I the only one waiting for Pharrell
Beautiful back brown hair song nice ❤❤❤ 2024
😂 me encantó sos pasitos ochenteros improvisados. Genial. ❤ esta mina me está gustando con ese estilo ochentero ❤
Pharrell Williams Don't sing?😮
She is a beauty Queen and looking just like her motha ! Strong and fabulous
moves are lazy as hell honestly. i loved flowers and glad she's "found herself" but come on this just hype train but choreo is god awful
Epic song
Love it, congratulations Miley
Miley is so beautiful and looks like she's having so much fun 😭❤️
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Die Frisur ist schrecklich.
❤
This is Maneskin
Women get better with age
❤❤❤❤❤ Divaaaaaaaaaaa
Viciada nessa música
MILEY-you sure suit single !❤😂
Not Pleasant to listen to her  $ex-Rap  or her voice  So I turn her OFF
Shes definitely a pop princess This album could elevate her to the title
ufff
Amei S2
Miley is just getting better and better. Looking better & better.  Like 🍷.
i really need to know what lip gloss/lipstick shes wearing here
She's just a vibe of fun...
Lord give me a fraction of her confidence! ❤
La más iconica!!!! ❤️✨
She looks like her mom😍
El mundo es tuyo!!! Madura resplandeciente sexy dueña de sí misma libre
It gives very 'I wanna be your slave' (Maneskin) vibes
amazing song remix feat Shakira
Brunette Miley is officially back yaayy
This video is what I needed today
She is FINE
Gorgeous
Stunning
Amo su evolucion. Lo mejor de lo mejor ❤❤❤❤❤❤
MILEEEEEU TELL SHAKIRA TO REMIX THIS FX SONG
Bop
Achei uma vibe bem anos 2000 eu gostei
I’m into it….Respect!
She looks so beautiful
Doctor is such a great song
Like if you've watched more than 5 times in 2 days 😅😂
I don't know, I really don't like it. I don't find it catchy, it's not something that I would sing my heart out nor something that I would dance my ass out with 😢
No se ve saludable....
Pharell and a beat are the very best of friends.
🤎
Incredibly beautiful, perfect body, dynamic voice.  I hate the tattos. It flaws perfection.
MILEY LOVE THE NEW STYLE
Miley always being amazing.
I'll be dreaming of this look and music video
Has anyone ever seen such beauty?
doctor is such a catchy song
let lil miley work u out
go girl
this is awesome
Miley is mothering so hard
work it mama
So where is Pharell ? 😂
more music videos like that
Jezu co to za sukienka ? ❤
Who does her choreography because i've seen better
I am not a Miley Cyrus fan, but the Tina Turner style with the upgraded voice had me wondering what I've been missing 😂
Que reina por favor
Beautiful smile, eyes and her teeth are perfect! She fits her name. Smiley Miley!
She's got the pipes, no doubt about that, but this is a weird song and her moves are too.
Song very nice
Every day I wil come back here to give her some stream ❤
😂😂😂 she makes me laught so hard porq está imitando a la naca de Gloria Trevi si ella es mejor for being american
The pop princess, Miley Cyrus
Man that song is gonna be a hit! Definitely!!!
❤ yes Love
Se nota la influencia de Williams la producción me recuerda un montón a blurred Lines
Miley nobody deserves you from this point onward. Keep your magic to yourself. <3
Esta chica es impresionante, me encanta la canción , suena muy fresca y a la vez antigua , no se es lo que quería escuchar 😂
Wow ! Look like Jane Fonda in movie Barbarella (1968) .
The first dress she starts the video with is giving Tina Turner vibes love the song it’s amazing 😍😊
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🪐
why is she so thin?
Ru Paulぽい
I would love to see you live but I can't afford it. But truly love you with all my heart 💖⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘☺
A mi ella me encnta lo que le veo es la cara como huesuda nose como si estuviera mala nose

El mejor presidente de la historia. 🦁🇦🇷
Miley is doing it. I just ❤her.
This is Miley's "Have fun with my music" era and I love it
Mundial 💥
Hermosa 😍
This Pharrell Williams Miley Cyrus music collaborative Doctor is zesty and a pleasant music escape of an odyssey, Miley Cyrus's lush vocals add to the raciness energy of Doctor in a fun way.
Icónicaaaaa 🩵
Yessss Miley! Own it it’s yours you pass proving yourself ❤❤❤

i've been watching this for an hour
I remember the first time I seen you when you were young on TV you blew my mind when you were singing. Cuz I never heard anyone sing so good.
Amei ❤🇧🇷
Hit
I loved every second of it
Miley vingativa não deixou o vocal do Pharrell nesse hit pq ele fez o mesmo com ela lá em 2014 na música do Pharrell William-Come Get It bae feat Miley Cyrus
You’re found an amazing style, keep shining in your own way. ❤
Miley Cyrus ❤❤❤👍🏻👍🏻
That is one crazy hairspray and dentist advertisement 😂
This is so her look, she looks so amazing and she's giving me Madonna vibes for some reason
Bardzo często jej słucham, super odpręża i relaksuje. Dzięki wielkie, tego było mi trzeba
I'm getting Tina Turner vibes...

Flop surgery Cyrus
She looks like she had so much fun just dancing and grooving. Good for her!
glad this new miley era happened
how great she is, you are Miley so good. love your new sound. really good. like a modern Loretta Lynn. country front and center.💓💗💞💖💝💘💕
im psyched
omg i dig it
wow such a catchy song omg  i live it
The Insecurities this girl eludes is really quite sad😢😢😢 she needs to find somebody to love
Miley 😍
This music sucks. Won’t last not even one year. Not even a one hit wonder. So sad music has become.
She now found her style
This sounds a lot like blurred lines by Robin Thicke. I know Pharrell produced both songs but this track didn’t really stand out to me. It’s going to be a smash hit though.
Tina, Beyonce...😊
this is giving the karma and lavender haze coats
Ann-Margret vibes and 80's aerobic exercise video vibes.
Where’s Pharrell Williams
La ameeeee ❤  me encantoo saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪
I can't stop staring at her, it's her world
My QUEEN is backkkkk!!! LOVE YOU MILEY!!
Imo- They didn't spend too much time on the lyrics! Both have done better work!  They are both wonderful artist...❤❤❤
She looks vibrant! Grown and the Miley we love to seee
❤❤❤❤❤
OMGGG!!!! LOVE!!!!!!!
Miley 👏🏻 her body shape n her voice are 💯
What.A..HIT
3.560
❤  Miley love the. NEW. LOOK.  ❤ LOVE the. SONG
HOTTTTT❤🎉
I see some Ann Margaret moves.
BE YOURSELF MILEY ❤
She's one singer of our generation that has the talent to blend with all genres. She should make another album like Plastic Hearts. This is good but that was on another level.
She looks healthy and happy! :D
MILEY MF CYRUS!!! ❤❤❤
Blurred Lines meets 80´s vibes with killer Vocals
I think for that unique smoky voice she needs much stronger songs with less autotune, she sounds great live, I don't understand why she doesn't make more of it and waste that talent on such simple songs.
As always Miley is killing it.❤
Where’s Pharrell? Song is mid
🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢
Miley is such a talent!  I saw a video of her voice training on a threadmill...singing while running to improve her endurance.  Such dedication to her craft!  She's exudes joy and is a pleasure to watch! ❤❤❤
I LOVE that Miley has her natural beautiful body. She is sexy as hell.
Miley is empowered, radiating confidence and having so much fun like it's no one's business. I live!
So catchy
Perfect commercial for a dentist 😂
Shes doing her thing..this song is "whatever to me" but i was smiling the whole ride.. 😉
Miley, I love how you know that the whole drama of people pointing fingers and going to doctors' offices the day after is all set up and manipulated (a Google search will tell you whose office you should visit in specific *cough cough*) in a way that's beyond comprehension. I saw a video of you asking people "Why are you acting like you don't know this song?" when you were singing your song "Flowers" during a concert a few weeks ago (I also noticed that Taylor Swift laughed after you made this question). It's amazing how people can act like they don't know somebody when it's convenient to them, but they laugh at said person behind his/her back. It makes ME want to ask Nicky and her people like they did to you a few years ago during the 2015 VMAs, "what's good?" I love you and forever will for keeping it real Miley Lots of love from DR
Why does she make music with autotune, it sounds a thousand times better live. I think she should produce more songs based on the style she covers, then every song of hers would be as megahit as flowers
Loving this 🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is a garbage song and I'm disappointed this actually sucks wtf Miley
In what pathetic world we are living in if that is called music art))))) Inconceivable...
Amazing from Morocco 🇲🇦🔥✨
no way flowers came out 1 year ago 😭😭 time flies
❤❤
So Pharrell did blurred lines once Nad now every song he produces has the same beat just a different s..t. It's getting borring.
She looks so comfortable in her skin and happy , I  love it
https://youtu.be/hKpWXXnCqf8?si=ZxlVps0MuSJiZMz4
Me da aires a gloria trevi jajajajjaja
She looks so good. Love this for her
Bangerz's queen back  bitches
It’s me or there is a Tina Turner inspiration… like the hair and the dress !!!! The song is awesome!!! Happy for her !!!!
es alucinante lo de Miley, la evolución mas flipante de la historia del pop, de niña cursi y repelente a una de la grandes divas del pop, LA AMAMOS
Künstliche Zähne und Haare 😂
Love it ❤
Jane Fonda vibes BIG TIME! I love this!!!
Mileeeyyyyy
Eu esperando o Pharrell aparecer no clipe ou na música 🤡 mas ameeeei demais o clipe, a Miley tá linda maravilhosa glamourosa nesse clipe 😢❤😢❤😢❤😢
She has the voice & the moves to go with it!
Yep
Stunning! Loving her vibe! She’s so comfortable in her skin. Get it get it! 🔥🔥🔥
My new song obsession on repeat, for at least the whole next week...❤
🔥
This song is so sexy 🥵
Her voice and her dance moves kinda  disturbs me. She kinda reminds me of a mixture between Austin Power’s dance moves, a t-Rex and something else I don’t know. She just is weird
This song sucks
This song is addictive
the Grammy look stole this song……….its a miss😏
wow
What a masterpiece🤩🤩🤩
After that first beat I expected to hear "I remember when... I remember when I lost my minddd" instinctively. 😭
Só eu achei que o videoclipe tem uma semelhança com Bad romance da Lady Gaga ???  achei MARAVILHOSO!!!!
Yeah I’m digging lol.  Took me two listens but I’m actually enjoying this
Tina Turner Energy. Love this
Esta mujer es una absoluta incognita ..se supera con cada trabajo...A mi,me encanta.Esta mescla de los 70/80 con los ritmos mas contemporaneos es absolutamente increíble...y,ella sola,llena la pantalla ❤Felicidades Miss Cyrus
Oh dear!, that awful hairstyle makes her look like a 50 year old trying to be 30. Fire your stylist.
Loving the Tina Turner vibes!
Can't even get this song out of my head
Such a BEAUTIFUL LADY!! Suck it up....LIAM...your LOSS!!!😂
Hannah Montana is back and she's cooler than ever!!!
❤❤❤
Why do you always do this! Make me fall in love with you.
Thalía 😮haha
❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉😍😍😍😍
I love it!!!!
Okay, Miss Teeth!
I could watch her all day and I’m not even gay😂
Jane fonda never looked this good
Miley, you are thriving 🌟👑❤
Someone Be My Friend Please
I want to hear her sing this live!!!
I swear I love all  famous peoples outfits like I wish I could wear something like that in a video!👇like or comment                                                                    if u feal the same
Love it! ❤
Why am I just now realizing how beautiful Miley Cyrus is 😰
❤ love this...
hear it once then it stucks
This era has got to be her peak.  I can't even imagine how she could get any better.  The look, the sound, its all so spot on right now.  She is a true star.
she looks so good, it's crazy how much like her mom she looks like too lol
What a collab... ALL the parts, distinct and unique, Unified into One Beatiful Collective Whole. ;-p ❤
That look is terrible for her...looks like an old person....the song is bad enough
Is that her real hair?
Miley is the Star,but were is Pharrell?😂
❤
I love how happy she looks lately, and how much fun she's having! 💙💜
🎉❤
damn it i will always love miley
can’t get into this - between this and Flowers - I must be in the boat that doesn’t feel a thing from listening to her tracks and find her voice underwhelming :(
🎉🎉
Nice ❤

A mulher veio com tudo pra abocanhar mais Grammys e ser o hit do ano
I can't stop dancing like her This is somehow harder than flowers
Number 1 youtube video. Expecting it to be number 1 on spotify and Billboard 100 very soon. ❤
Hairography slayed 😅❤
Trying to get 1 million YouTube subscribers by the end of the year without posting a video! Please share
She can't dance or just move. She doesn't have the sexy factor.
I guess the message is to work out first :p
best legs in the business.
Taylor who?
Great
Doesn`t sound like this (?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOb9Xaug35M the first strophe

This gives off an 80's vibe
She can be my doctor anyday!!!!

Miley’s recent look reminds me of the 80’s Jane Fonda.
AWESOME ! MILEY YOU ROCK !! ❤❤❤
Super: delivering Jane Fonda meets Tina Turner. Miley became a beautiful woman: work it out, gorgeous!
I am confused...
🎊🎊
QUEEN❤
You slay
you have to go to medical school to be doctor or a nurse, which also requires a degree, is she talking about a Ph.D.? Too Short also references this in his music
Jkk
Hi
She is so dynamic! Cool🤩
Liam should’ve worked it out😂… dumby
She looks like Jane Fonda in Barbarella, so stunning.😍🥰
This is the best I've seen her look
The. Arm thing tho

Those legs!!!
A successful graduate of the Elaine Benes Dance School.
Here the doctors ✌️ and my lovely Nurses ✌️
I love Miley, but seriously what is that?
Her hair is so big cause is full of secrets!!! 😊
I love the fact she kept her Grammy's hairstyle for this music video.
SHES SO CUTEEEE
WHAT A SKANK
Honey give it up you are no Tina
Exceedingly mediocre
Inspired by Maneskin - I wanna be your slave.
Miley What this Hair?🤭🤭🤭
What a pleasure have Miley in the industry
Miley for #SuperBowl2025
Miley, your talent and charisma light up the stage like no other. Your music resonates with millions, and your boldness inspires us all. Keep shining and being unapologetically you!
🎉❤
Girl, teach us how to have perfect smooth homogeneous armpits
Miley has become the best version of herself lately.
80’s  baby just can’t feel this hairdo. Hand some white AquaNet to one of us genxers and we’ll hook u up Miley.
Miley is a vibe. That is all. I'm gonna work it out!
❤❤❤
An icon!! 💕 amazing song and video.❤
This is the most Hannah Montana-esque video she's released. Even down to the laugh at 2:44 like the starting credits.
slay girl!
Annoying !!
Love everything about this except the hair. Simply hideous 😢  Bad extensions are the worst
Does anyone notice it has the same vibes as blurred lines!!?
Maravilhosa! Amando esse estilo meio Tina Turner ❤
White girl ish 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how much fun she is having!! Get it Miley! U DESERVE, huneee!!!
Pasando la doctor. Su mejor canción es y será Flores
Great Voice, Gorgeous Woman & Peppy Song!  Don't care for the hair and cheap tattoos.
Who is this song for?
Muito icônica mesmo!! Servindo desde sempre ❤❤❤
Honestly she’s giving me Freddie Mercury vibes with her totally carefree performance style and I’m loving all of it
she looks sooooooooooooooogood
Shudder!!
Doesn't this give off the same vibe as her Grammy performance with flowers?
I love Miley. I loved her dad when I was younger, and I still love Dolly. I lived through the 80s, though. Please don't bring back this hair. Our atmosphere can't handle it! We went through cases of Aqua Net in a week, I tell you! CASES! 🤣
Super 👌👌👌👌💯💯....
There is something very cheesy about this song and catchy.
Time for taste of my own 😎
So Pharrell just did the beat I guess lol
Not sure if I am feeling her buccal fat remover. Her mouth looks different.
Whats with the Jane Fonda resemblance
HIT ❤
Is Miley openly asking Hemsworth to work it out for just one night in roleplay?
Jesus. Christ. Literally I would do anything for this woman.
Sexy woman and dancer ❤️😊
Watching her fuzzy outfit ripple is so satisfying
WTF is this shit. 💩
Love this song! Go Miley!
She’s got those Tina Turner legs
Dear White Ppl, if Beyoncé is a “dog” for doing country, what you call Miley for doing this?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this is so fun! I love it.
She may be still nice with can't be tamed vibe
She looks incredible it’s giving Hannah
I see måneskin I want to be your slave opening
please, can you put on subtitles for us?? thank you
When a Disney princess become a Queen!
Why does the beginning remind me of maneskin i wanna be your slave? It has some resemblance to it
WEAR YOUR CROWN QUEEEN
I love like she shines... the song feels like her old essence❤
The beat sounds exactly like I wanna be your slave by maneskin
oh this sounds like a cut from pharrells 2014 album 💀💀💀
That is a banger !
I like the video, as for the song I honestly just like the chorus. The rest I could live without. I keep listening just for the chorus.
I could watch her dance forever, the happiness she radiates is insane
love yaaa❤❤❤ need a broken song
This is now #1 on my Songs That Don't Need to Exist list.
love this new song, a great song to move too. Also just having a simple music video with her dancing is refreshing.
Performance is good. But this song is straight trash. I'm disappointed
Tremenda obsesion que tengo con Doctor 💖💖🖤🖤🎶🎶💃💃 el video y el ritmo es Super Pegadiza 🔥🔥❤❤ no dejo de Escucharla
Undoubtedly beautiful
Seeing her happy after everything she has been through makes me happy and motivates me to align myself with my purpose 💓
MILEY SLAYED THIS. THIS IS EVERYTHING
Yeassss Miley!!!
Shakira vibes 🔥
Sorry but this song is not as great as flowers and also the rhythm is almost the same as maneskins I wanna be your slave.  Nevertheless, I like Miley and think she can do so much better.  Her fashions is okay but could be more creative regarding her tattoos. 😜
Sadly Sparks of Beyonce to me, but I do love Miley.
how is this a good song? lol.
The dance moves are something a 5 year old would do
Miley is so free and I love it!! 😻🔥
She has really long arms 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She took time to heal over the years and look how she has us gagging. MILEY ALWAYS been that girl. Don’t sleep on her!😱👏🏾🤌🏾💯
Dolly parton
Miley looks like she’s having the time of her life!!! Absolutely radiant.
Perfect song for workout
Let me work it out
I love how you can feel the Pharell williams energy in the rythm. Miley is having the best time of her career, I'm so happy for her. I love her evolution, She's a true icone ❤️❤️
yeah nah
Cada vez mais loba, amo <3
Ela sabe que venceu ❤
Don’t mess with Miley she’s like fine peace of wine baddie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The body is wow !
holy crap she looks amazing<3
So vibrating ✨🧘🏻‍♂️
Wait, where's pharrel😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This gives me Kylie vibes  ❤❤❤ so good miley slay queen
.
queen of music❤❤❤❤
AAAAAAAAAH❤🤠💙🎯🥊⛸️🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏆
Харесва о да естествено Майли Сайръс завинаги, тя е прекрасна жена и най добрата певица браво успех ❤️💝❣️💓
O Pharrel faltou na gravação?
She's amazing! Werq!!!!
this sounds like it almost made it to Bangerz
The drag queens are creating routines all over the country to this song!
I love you so much that I just want to kiss you and touch your beautiful body!🤔⚘💖⚘💖😚
I hope Miley sees my comment. This black lesbian is feeling "Tina Turner circa 1979". Keep it going.
Got the 80's big hair....we dont need that again
Of course it's a matter of opinion, but this just isn't very good.  I see no particular originality, musical skill, or singing or dancing ability.   And yet most of the other comment are glowing.  Maybe I just don't recognize talent.
Channelling Tina Turner 😂
What music?????
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥👍👍!
Loooove this one, feels like it was a scrapped bangerz song ahhhh Bangerz vibes
Gilr I LOVE it. She looks soo good! Definitely catchy.  Love your voice MILEY ❤️ 💕 ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤ perfect melody   https://youtu.be/AtR_zjoy6NA?si=VGsEi1PCnZkAquDa
I think her dance is silly, but she looks astounding!
Fabulous Queen ❤
People are dying in Gaza and others are dancing naked!!!!what a world we live in!!!  On the day of judgement, the truth will appear, and those who pleased God will enter paradise even if they were tortured in this life. And those who seem happy and forget God, will get what they deserve forever. May God guide everyone to Islam❤❤❤
We LOve YOu
This is a grown woman not trying to please anyone or get any attention.  We love this Miley.  You have your own stage, own it mama we are here for it.
I love you miley,you're the only female holding this industry with you're songwriting and evolutionary songs but I can't subscribe to a genocide supporter 💔 😢 free palestine all day everyday to the river to the sea paelstine will be free 🙏 ❤❤❤
Hizo el paso de britney
Love you Miley! ❤
GODDESS ❤
This reminds me.of a pharel song😊

Miley was like a time bomb full of happiness, joy, confidence and optimism, then it exploded, making us happy with her.❤❤❤❤❤
This is giving me studio 54 vibes.    I’m here for it!
Ummm… I’ll just listen to rivers again
Miley is back ....she full of life again. M really happy for her.
Who's her dentist?

Miley
She makes you love yourself as a woman!

Tina turner
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Te adoro Miley 🇪🇨🇪🇨🇪🇨
Her hair style reminds me of original Sindel.  I want to see the reverse skunk stripe.
Es la versión en inglés de doctor psiquiatra de gloria Trevi 😊
I love how Miley did not change her body like all the other female artists have done😊
being a meme incoming
Hermosa ❤
01:54 is such a postal! I love it so much.
sooo tina turner! I love it!!!!
The real meaning of ICONIC
The Grammy’s performance was just the beginning of a new era that is completely working on me.
I see a rupaul/cher reference!!!
All I can hear is “I Wanna Be Your Slave” by Maneskin
❤❤❤❤❤
🇲🇽✨💃🏼✨💃🏼
Браво Мајли
Good video, nice moves, very very sexy
Hermosa canción y ella mas❤
barbie miley ❤
Prepare to hear this in every spin class for the rest of time
❤
She is bringing 80s back and I love it
Do it Miley!!!!!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
❤
Another meaningless song. I miss the wreaking ball generation.
Hannah Montana eres tu  ?🧐😳
You can See her inner happiness. So beautyful
✨✨✨✨✨😻😻😻🖤
I love miley but this hair adds 10 yrs..maybe she's going for a mature look?  Great song tho.
I don't like her
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽❤️‍🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰
❤❤❤
She is look like a 'yıldız tilbe' 😂😂😂😂
😏😏😏
haha funny this isn't available on spotify 😝
I can hear the robin thicke beats
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Artista.
well...God is really a woman ♥
I just fell in love with this video ❤ Her energy, music, etc is everything!
Your teeth . Beautiful
Gdyby żyła w PL byłaby taką Dodzią lub Mandaryną.
OMGosh Miss Miley ❤❤ it's fun that this child star is now an iconic 👑
hannah montana
Is there a bit of Tina Turner in all of this, or am I seeing things?
Pharrell Williams, where?
Does she remind anyone else of Dolly Parton with that hair?
Sounds a bit like I Wanna Be Your Slave by Måneskin
Omg, better krasavice,  blasen 😅
splendid
This isnt very good
Her body looks STUNNING! ❤
Miley 😍😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤🖤
Ahh Miley❤
God I love her 😍😍
Her voice, her personality and her growth are so amazing ❤
This is I wanna be your slave by Maneskin….
I see the Tina turner’s influence
Insufferable dork
Sounds like she is using Maneskins beats! Not original, sorry Miley
Mother is mothering
Isso que é cantora de verdade ❤
She's an icon i love her so much
Lov this song and is a bop 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let me work it out
GIVE US CHOREOOOO 💃🏼💃🏼
Anyone in 2024-2025-???? (not begging for likes)❤
https://youtu.be/2xtcVH191Pk?si=1Kv1oD5TbMGN_ygY
She’s back ❤
Good good ❤
Queen of this generation
ARTEEEE
QUEEN IS BACK
MOTHER 🤩
I love the song. The only problem is as a 53-year-old man I still can't get over seeing Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana😂😂😂 I know I'm sorry😂😂 I watch this video and I feel like I'm doing something wrong😂😂😂 great song though😂😂
Hair and dress hommage on late Queen Tina Turner
MASTERPIECE❤
VOCALS HAIR LOOK ART
Flop. Streams: “Yes,and?” By: Ariana G.
Esta canción es un  descarte de su icónico album Bangerz
Queeen
Bet this would get play on those country stations. Cute bop ngl ❤❤
genious
I really like her and her music but this one feels pretty lame, The video production is even sader, rent out a photostudio with couple of paper background  rools for $60 an hour and shoot with a mobile phone. Zero creativity and zero production value.
Действительно Майли нашла себя. И это просто великолепно❤
but what's her skin routine?
Song is trash and I usually like most of her songs
I love this song
I fall in love this song
Miley is in her best era yet 💯💯🔥🔥
She is so beautiful ❤
My queeeeeen
An incon
So boring and ridiculous
Nossa tá linda demais.! ❤
Tina Turner ❤❤❤
❤😊to show where it hurts
You go girl! Miley has this distinctive voice that you can't deny you like. She looks so good, my only thing is that hair, I don't like the hair. But everything else is😍😍😍
The beat yall
❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Straight to the hub after this 🤣
Annoying! She doesn't reach knees of her aunt Dolly.
Simplemente hermosa y talentosa
❤
Mama Cyrus!!!!
Acredito que Miley está em sua MELHOR FASE e se encontrou de verdade. Multiartista que ela é, trazendo novas facetas sempre em seus trabalhos. Amo demais isso nela, e é muito especial ver onde ela chegou(para quem a acompanha desde 2007).
Holler 😁
I absolutely love her. She’s growing as an artist.
Mi dispiace ma in Italia questa canzone non sarà apprezzata e sinceramente non piace neanche a me😢
Lemme work it out
Just a queen❤😊😊🎉
She's coming back with EVERYTHING
Sozinha no vídeo porque ela brilha muito ❤
I love how it looks like she's just out of the Grammys performance and shooting this to celebrate, because if it was the case she's having the time of her life in this video, so uplifting 🥳  PS.: to further increase the party feeling I just noticed she credited even the VFX and the on-set medic, that's so sweet! 🥰
Me encanta ❤❤❤
❤exelente maily.😊
Good
Miley is everything❤❤🎉🎉
Not quite as good as grindin by clipse
Move over, the Queen has entered the building❤
It gives me Maneskin vibe ❤
✨ ⚜️ ✨
Not my favorite hairstyle on her 😅
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Grammy❤
la mejor
Acá escuchando indefinidamente este tema hasta que se haga viral ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Iconic, simply iconic, I can see a lot of people imitating the dance all over the world, her eyes, her smile, her hands.... everything is amazing.
❤❤❤❤❤
Great song for the strip clubs
Your hair is amazing
I see beyonce and tina turner
Love it!👏👏👏💖💖💖
Yas! a total BOP! Love it
Achy breaky drug addiction barbie? ....Nobody? The song is good tho. Just can't get past looking at her hair and not seeing Billy Rae from decades ago. She looks wonderful otherwise.
So Pharrell recreates that Robin Thicke blurred line  instrumental and adds more snares and dumbs and y’all think this is it. 🤦🏾‍♂️ musicians have become lazy and it’s your fault
Miley's body is always🔥 whenever I see her
In her ✨️redemption era✨️
Miley, this song is 🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
Lembra Houdini da sua lipa
it’s a bit catchy ..
and so the Disney princess becomes the queen <3
Her body looks incredible, she has been working out
Love the song. I have become a huge fan of Miley. She looks gorgeous Love this new look and I love her personality.. She looks radiant and lots of sex appeal. Well done Miley... Be true to yourself... the sky's the limit for you.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
love it
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
YESSS MILEYY
I'm sorry, but I do not like this.
Nice Video, but the song is really boring!
Confidence is really over rated.
Huynya yakas
Tina Turner vibes
Yay ❤ my Queen ❤
Obsessed with this song and her hair !!!
Does this sample Maneskin?
this is Hannah Montana!...
i'm scared
Love the hair love the fit!! Same with the Grammy’s look!! 💞
https://youtube.com/shorts/oA8XGWKV_BA?feature=shared
Giving me 2010s music video cinematography
She’s obviously appropriated Tina Turner. It seems since many of this generation do not recall the eighty’s or ninety’s , they seem to be recreating that era.  She ‘s still much more talented and entertaining than most of todays pole dancers with microphones. IMHO Cheers!!
That’s why I always loved her over Ariana grande lol she is the real icon of this generation not Ariana
Miley looks and sounds amazing!!
Miley turning into her god mom right in front of our eyes cause she looks just like dolly these days 😂😂💙💙
She really " lipsang for her life"
Yeah, that'd do it.
Perfeita.
She’s the happiest and most confident I’ve seen in a while and I’m here for it. Go Miley!! ❤❤❤
MILEYYYYYYYY DAAAAAAAMN QUEEEN
Flopped

Miley on ytop

Egypt love Miley 🇪🇬
It's giving Great Value, Tina Turner.
this is also an easter egg. I heard she's gonna be on Grey's anatomy next season. playing a cardiologist i think.
Where is Pharrell Williams?!😁
She's serving Tina Turner vibes.❤
Mmmmm
I could be your dr i could be your nurse i got a 9 inch syringe waiting for a good time😉
❤❤
i love you ❤❤❤
queen
Is it inspiration by MANESKIN?? 🤔
I don't know if it's The clip or the song or both but it's just INCREDIBLE !!!! Miley is on her way to get one more Grammy.
No offense to anyone but this song could be better suited as pop punk, and Pharell should have given it to Gwen.
Love it!
I love you Your Highness!❤🎉
Love you your highness!❤🎉
Fucking AMAZING 😻 SO BEAUTIFUL
Teach me the dinosaur moves Miley 😊 1:32
❤❤❤❤❤
Une tuerie 💕💕💕 sa voix et son style enfin parfait depuis Flowers !!!
Divaaaaa 😍👏🏾
Giving me major Tina Turner vibes ❤❤❤❤
Divaaaa
Simplesmente obcecada com essa fase madura da Miley. Go Mileyyy
That body honey 😍🔥
Parece a batida de treller Michael Jackson
So pretty Miley! She really has "  it."
Rockin hard
I don't hear Pharrell Williams anywhere
This gives early 2010's vibes. We need more music like this!
It sounds like "I wanna be your slave" by @Maneskin, slower version
Good job. Another work of art. Way to go!😊❤
Queen
Miley in her grown woman energy!! LOVEEEE LOVEEE LOVEEEE ❤
just look at her!! This is the reason You don't stay in the wrong relationship. The wron person will dim your shine!
She is not Beyoncé or Tina.
When Jane Fonda and Tina Turner have a child😂
Yes. Let’s Dance ❤
Que máquina👠
Good music
Se que Miley Cyrus no debe saber de mi existencia pero me encantó esta canción increíble cambio de estilo musical quisiera hacer una colaboración con ella no por fama si no porque siempre fue mi sueño saludos desde bolivia -cochabamba
Şarkıdan video klipteki enerjiden çıkamıyorum inanılmazz❤️❤️❤️💫💫💫
Why there is no translations
🧐🧐😏😎
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not a good song
Absolutely❤🫶🏻♥️
one of the few A+ list artists from our generation. ICONIC.
❤I totally love her!!💎
My favourite version of Miley is this version. Her smile is contagious and this video is definitely staying on my playlist.
Not a big deal
A voz de milhões! O timbre dela é maravilhoso, canta demais 😊
Price of the clip : 1 $
Hi Miley, Good video 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Can you make a new music like the style of Beyoncé Run the world, but at your style like this video, with am, long dress black etc... Thank you, make god bless You and America ❤❤❤❤
SEI LA MIA REGINA
Música chatinha e o cabelo dela tá muito feio, não combinou com ela
Wtf?
Queen
its a mix of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ZZKNPrSPw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs but slowed
She's got tatoos like a gas station toilet door
❤❤
Love this sound ! The remix of Dj LGV (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9zjf6z13zc&ab_channel=DjLgv) brought me here
하고 싶은거 다해요~~^^ 그녀는 다 가졌어요 진짜 너무 좋아❤❤❤
Oooouuuuf😮
Sound just like one of Maneskin song!!!!! Completely copied
So beautiful
De longe essa é a melhor fase da Miley, eu tô amando! ❤
Everyone Keep streaming
she is overrated
Miley x Pharrell got 1
Listening to this song and enjoying it so much after Miley's winning at the Grammys makes me so proud of her and her beautiful evolution to an ICON 💖 Hannah Montana was my favourite Disney series and now my inner child is healed 😇🥰
WE LET YOUUUU ❤️‍🔥
Muy guay me ecsnta ❤❤❤❤se esta  luciendo con esta musica hace unos años y su último albun es mortsl

Hello there
Her plastic surgeon is a hero 😍
She is trying to be a Tina..but, okay nice vibe...
SHE'S GIVING EVERYTHING!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Be Miley. . Don't portray the image of Beyonce.... Be the great Miley
Fab, absolutely love Work it Out. Its my new morning song and routine ... 78 💃
Pharrell has raised lots of money for the IOF.. divest from Zionists!
Whay is this so Tati coded????
my queen <3
Another Grammy
Хуйня якась
To all the people saying she copied Maneskin, you do realize the single was made in 2012 and is an unreleased track of Bangerz? So wayyy older than their single Check your info before y'all spread misinformation about my gurl
Perfeita ❤
Wow❣️
Idk why this is giving early 2000s Tom Ford commercial in the best way
30s never looked better!
Love you ❤❤❤❤❤
Yikes. Hope you are giving Måneskin some credit for this song. Total rip off of their melody
Que talento de esta mujer!! Me gusta
😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗
dayuuuuuum
Omg I love her so much !!!!
This sounds like Maneskin's song "I wanna be your slave". Miley usually does some original sounding stuff so I blame Pharrell
She's sparkling ! You can see it in her eyes cause the eyes are the mirrors of the soul.
Our Queen so proud of her
“I’m midnight medication. Just show me where it hurts.” I dunno but I laugh when she sings this line. A fun song indeed 😆
Her voice is awfullll
Pharell is definitively a genius !
Maravilhosa
this song is a masterpiece!!! miley cirus never disappoints ❤❤ listening to this song everytime anyone leaves a like 😊😊😊
She’s just being miley ❤
gurl this is so c*nty! I looooove it.
the beat reminds me of Blurred Lines hehe Miley is amazing though
True diva ❤
Not a good song for a great singer just saying!
I'm obsessed with this Miley video.
Cc
MILEY IS EVERYTHING AND MORE 💘
Queen
The chorus is giving Beyoncè
Jj

Slay ❤❤❤
🎉 0:52
Hjb😢
The tattoos ruined tge femininity of the dress. Making it look cheap. Also the moves. Why she cant be elegant a bit!?
Magical queen omg im obsessed with u
Hannah?
Perfect teeth ❤
Gente: la Miley Mercedes no existe. La Miley Mercedes: let me work It out....
Those opening beats though, Blurred Lines anybody? 😂
It sounds like a maneskin Song🤔
Only I can say, I LOVE IT!!!
Great song. But where’s Pharrel in this video?
Crazy Melodie Switch but it burns. 🔥❤
Not my fav
i dont like it
Shes definitely a pop princess This album could elevate her to the title
Miley is so ripped wow
A copy of MANESKIN
MANESKIN
Her body ❤ on fire 🔥  amazing girl 💃
Great 👌
she looks soooo scary. Stop normalizing plastic surgery
MAGNÍFICA 💙
❤❤❤❤❤
2:25 was so good
Miley is The Madonna of '23🎉
We love witnessing the "pop chameleon"  always evolving. It's truly amazing to see ❤ And finally winning a grammy, long overdue accolade for this ICON!!
Repent and believe the gospel!!!✝️💙
I just love Miley in this one … spirit so high
I think I realize why I love this hair so much and it’s because we get to see that gorgeous FACE featured!!!!! Yes mawma!!!!
Where’s Pharell Willias?
She has blossomed into a true entertainer...so much talent
Ti amo
Super girl, brilliant singer!❤
Her performance is giving me Tina Turner vibes
forças
❤❤
Has anyone seen Pharrell Williams? 😂❤
Wow. We can rarely see someone bursting woth positive energy on videos. And she does it for quite some time now. And way is noone showing appreciation about her physique??Thats the result of some HARD work. She truly blossomed!
My queen!❤
Vibras de Shakira en she wolf 1:12
Proud of you queen
She has nice teeth
I need some aspirin..
She sure can be a doctor and even a nurse but can she pay royalties to Maneskin for their Slave song?
This song is so good
I am sure Måneskin is not so happy to copyright their song!!! This song has the same rhythm as "I wana be your slave" from Måneskin. This time Miley, really screwed it up. You are too unique to copy others.
Definitivamente estoy enamorada de Miley ES TAN HERMOSA
Peak Cyrus
Madonna 2.0
Don’t let this flop
I don't know WHY But this style Reminds me of Hannah Montana
Where is Pharell? Is he even singing?
Miley is truly iconic and confident, love seeing her shine like a diamond!
This is so dumb that the channel owners prohibit showing the video in Russia. Like, why? Oh, I forgot, of course the inability to watch a video of some star from 2000 in America will certainly destroy the dictatorship in Russia. You're disgracing yourself
❤❤❤❤❤❤😂 very proud of you Miley you go girl
Miley Cyrus very impressed you go to little girl
How happy does she look x
She is legendary 😮❤🔥
wow 50 looks good on her...
Thalía???
The iconic Pharrell producer tag at the beginning.
I love this team up. A collaboration in the making.
Start of the song is giving me Måneskin vibes. :D
😆 🤣 😂
GOSTOSAAAA
Miley will forever  be a legend!💎😍
🔥🔥
Afrodite
Pharrell Mastermind over 20 years 🫡 N.E.R.D😎
Queen that you are
❤❤❤❤❤
She is beautiful love it
Vai em português mesmo...Que baita lançamento! Uma música empolgante e uma energia! Essa era a Miley que esperávamos ver após Flowers e o tão merecido Grammy. Parabéns, também, Pharell! És impecável nessas parcerias, como naquele álbum da Madonna que marcou minha vida adulta! ❤
When I hear Miley Cyrus sing about  sex I think of Forest Gump " I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tasted like cigarettes."
Her hair style makes her look 50 years old
That melody song is same melody of blurred lines of robin thicke
My favorite soooonggggggg
Perfect song for me cause I'm suffering from seizures these days❤
Amazing Song Miley❤❤ you did it again❤❤
Finally not a ballad
Fine, but very Maneskin
Erlich Sie ist Bild Hübsch und Sexy eine Traumhaft schöne Frau und Sängerin  sie ist Bild Hübsch und Knackig ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Blurred lines beat is all I can hear.
❤❤❤
Exceptionally good production!
Miley it's in her best moment now ❤
Divina
At last! something other than the disgusting reggaeton, the disgusting current music.  ¡Por fin! algo que no sea el asqueroso reggaeton, la asquerosa música actual.
Mortal Kombat Sindel vibes🔥
her hairdresser should get the raise of a lifetime.....!....and replace her cheesy songwriter/composer....
🎉❤
Maneskin much ?
Майли косит под Тину Тёрнер 😊
0:11 Abang parkir di alfamart be like :
I'm so proud for you 🎉🎉🎉 Miley u go girl 🤟🤟🤟Thank you for the energy you bring after so many ups and downs ❤️‍🔥 Love u my Hannah Montana 🤟
hate this new hair that debuted at the Grammys. it doesn't suit her at all.
God, not that hair do again!
Yeah increible 😍😍😍
I just love her❤❤
I listened to this song a few times now and i still don't know when and where Pharrell sings😅😅
You can tell this is a rejected track.
One of last female artists with rocknroll in her heart . Wild and beautiful. Shining
Watched with the sound off. It's giving 2010 Beyonce.
Love her usually but this song is a no to me
2 words : star power.
Miley cooked, ate, & served🔥
Love this jam - yesss Miley❤❤
THE HANNAH MONTANA LAUGH
Supernova Superstar
That Naughty America Theme was lit 👄
MILEY YOU'RE SO FUN I LOVE THIS!!!
😍🥰 just icon
11 years later and this song is finally released…!!!! An absolute queen this is gonna be a hit🩵🩵
Que gustazo de canción, the BEST
❤❤❤❤
Buy Shiba Inu coin the golden cross is proof ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
Doesn't this sound like a Maneskin song?
Dunno why am getting some lady Gaga vibes from this...plus, where is Pharrell Williams in the video?😢
Wind mill u
Gloriosa.
The first legend song for 2024 🤩❤️
This stinks😂
It's too similar to Måneskin' "I wanna be yout slave"
I love a success story. She really did an epic comeback. And Pharrell's sound is super distinct here 👌
Summer music has arrived!💞💞🌸🌸👏🏽👏🏽
Pharrell Williams?? 😅
❤❤
🌞 Perfect Sunshine 🌞
Beginning out of .. ,, I wanna be your slave I wanna be your master” Maneskin
Pharrells sounds are always the same. I never ever like them. Same goes for this song as well.
at what point did Lady Gaga hand over her soul?
That song seems generic. Not a good song.
Miley chanelling her inner Tina and I am here for it!
Already a hit in 2024
Suddenly Miley is trying to emulate Beyoncé, lol.
Let’s make it her new hit!
Its giving nothing
Bday vibes
❤️❤️❤️

I can’t hear anything else than Pharrell with Robyn thick in this song
I love it 🥰!
Only the true smilers know that this song isn’t new 🤭🫶🏻
I have never seen a big star do "New Star" things! I'm so proud of Miley and this song is fun!
I was waiting for Pharrell Williams to arrive..
Rainha
This is a really cute song miley you did a great job thank you
YASSS! MILEY MILEY MILEY ❤❤❤
Is she of age now this child
Hello Miley: You need to seriously cry out to God & repent of your sins. There's no need for you to be dressing sexually explicit in music videos. You're promoting sexual immorality and having a very bad influence on women. Also, men don't cheat on your girlfriends or wives. It messes them up and contributes to the high divorce rate. I dont know if you'll ever read this but know that Im praying for you to become born again. If Justin Bieber can repent, which he did, then so can you. Jesus hasn't forgotten about you. Always remember that in  Genesis 1.1, God made created everything knowing it would fail & betray but chose to do it anyways out of love. I want to see you become a Christian & start making Christian rock albums glorifing God the way Skillet & Kutless do in their music. -Mike
Perhaps in my twenty years of life thus far, there have only been two when I wasn’t in love with Miley Cyrus.  (those were the first two years)
Miley, your talent and charisma light up the stage like no other. Your music resonates with millions, and your boldness inspires us all. Keep shining and being unapologetically you!
Miley tanx for making this our era😢😢😢😢
Could be worse :) never listen to me covering this ❤ 🫠😅😂🤣💧💦🌊
please revive american pop please
Uplifting
Que bien se ve con ese Miley con ese estilo a lo Tina Turner 💃
Buy Shiba Inu coin the golden cross
Pharrel show us again his iconic producer tag
Buy the golden cross Shiba Inu coin
1 thing about Miley and her songs that makes her different from everyone else, is, you can really feel her emotions in any song she does. Rather happy or sad, you truly feel it.
GODDESS😍
I actually really love that her lips look like they don't have any fillers. I noticed it only because so many people have so obviously fake plumpness to their lips that seeing real lips is rare 😅
Yas Miley
It's truly remarkable how distinct life feels when you're living in alignment with your purpose! You radiate an undeniable aura of Confidence authenticity and fulfillment. Unstoppable!! So Inspiring Miley!
Feast for the Senses!!  😎 Miley Rules!! ✌Supreme! ❤
Buy Shiba Inu coin it has golden cross
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is full Miley
DAAMMN #MILEY!! 🥵 ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
Apparently this song was supposed to be on Bangerz but it was scrapped. It definitely reminds me of that era. It has the same energy as Get It Right ifykyk
Miley
She remembered her underwear this time!
This is not a good song.... At All...
I feel something like Maneskin
Is it bad that I laughed I mean I love Miley but😂
Почему всего лишь 2,7 млн просмотров?. Она должна быть сегодня около 10млн
What is the value of this? Making money behaving like an object? Do better, Miley.
That hair is sooo dolly parton
The beat at the very start sounds like the start of blurred lines by Robin Thicke
Can someone "translate" the song for me? What it's about? I think I don't get the message. I'm not a native speaker... Need help to understand the song. :/
QUEEN ICON MOTHEEEEEERRRRR
Madonna sucks, MILEY Rocks
Hipnótica 🤩
Miley has really grown into a beautiful woman. She looks happy  too. Congratulations
Tina are you here? 😮
A no from me. The hair alone 🤣
Love the song🔥Giving me Thriller/Off the Wall vibes. Hope it's not gonna turn Blurry🙃
She is awesome
She has always been an icon, a legend, mature and one of the best vocalist around  You all just have been busy judging her for everything.
So great!! 👏🎉
Everyone saying it's similar to Maneskin song no, this song is atleast 10 years old which was leaked 7 years back. You can still find old version of this song.
❤❤❤❤❤
Thalía?
Miley Rules ...Period.......
🕶️🔥
Amo esta nueva canción ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉💙💙💙🤩👍👍👍
I just love love Miley but the song is not my cup of tea!
Oh if only it didn't sound like " I wanna be your slave "by månskin in the verses
This song is addicting af! 😅 It's on repeat!
Por qué ya todos los artistas mainstream suenan como algo que ya hemos escuhado millones de veces. Basta.
Sa voix☺️❤❤❤
Is no one else hearing how similar it is to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOb9Xaug35M
It's sounds like Måneskin's song: New song
This song is great and I'm obsessed with this since.
Miley never quit she is still here and not going anywhere!!!!
$Platinumoreoz 🤧🤒🤕
QUEEN!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ll L v e y o u 🙏🏻 🇮🇩 🥹 🤎 🖤 🤍 🩷
Not a fan of the heels she’s wearing in the video it looks off
Gracias por ser iconica ❤
She makes impossible not to click that like 👍🔥🔥
На наших глазах Майли Сайрус из смешного рядового ребенка,превратилась в певицу которой восхищаются.Я вижу как она заменила тех кто выдохся.❤🎉
BORING AS F$CK
Idk what she nailed best, the song or the performance in this video 😅
I'm so happy to see you so confident and looking so happy ; it's inspiring! Take care Miley ❤❤❤
It song makes me  feel like living in the 90's again
Went and watched Beyoncé Work It Out straight away…Different genre but v similar lyrics in parts, similar styling, dance moves, energy…also prod by Pharrell
Oh I love this new song and video everyone it is awesome
Queennnn 👏👏👌👌
love it !!!
Love it. Gives me Kylie Minogue vibes.
She looks like a member of girls aloud in this
She's definitey Outshing the song.. She needs stronger material. All the comments say nothing about the song .She looks great !
Let’s go
Sing it girl! Love the hair!!!
I think I’m not gay anymore 😂
Reminds me of dr.beat. in love 😍😍😍
MILEY ES DIOS TE ALABO YOU’RE A GODDESS MILEY
This song is for me 😂😂😂
I love Miley. I would love to meet her for lunch one day at a seafood restaurant and talk about music and the business. She seems so down to earth she would probably do that too. Ha she's awesome proud of all her success.
Shine
Queen of everything❤❤❤❤❤ Queen of bop❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Love her hair it's so pretty. ❤
Anybody else hearing the Måneskins - I wanna be your slave similarities?
She has really grown up and you can see it .
Hot!
No one thinks this sounds familiar…?
plagiarism of maneskin
This song is so annoying
She loookssss soooo happyyyy OMG ! She is back !!!!
After viewing 9 times  I can see 3 different clothes Till 8 time see only one clothes 😂😂😂
But... and Pharrel?
MILEY IS SO ICONIC.
First, that is Bob Mackie again, right?!?  Second, this video brings back everything that was great about the late 70s/early 80s aesthetic. Scavullo would be so proud....... It is a joy to see Miley in full command of her powers now...such a joy!
she can and does heal us! with her awesome music! !! luv her!!!
When is the album out
Reminds me of a pop variation of Måneskin.
Miley ATE this. Confidence looks so sexy on her 🔥
Is she using smth? Her eyes looks like a persons eyes who PERIODICALLY using ayvaska or some other drugs… don’t know  Maybe it meant to be for this video. But I’m really curious…
♥️♥️♥️🎉♥️♥️♥️🥰😘😇🤗🙂🤗🐻🍯🐻♥️♥️♥️♥️
Who regrets it? Liam Hemsworth: Yes
Love the hair, outfit, best of all, her awesome confidence!
YES Relatable 🌟!!!! Her wild hair is so 👑🦁
Me encanta ver a Miley así de feliz 😍
I love the vintage tone
I LOVE THIS ERA ❤🔮💗
Her hair is just as iconic as Mariah Carey. Call it BIG HAIR ENERGY
Best of both worlds 🙌
i can't explain how but this music video is so queer-coded
Couldn't get a better Pop beat from Pharrell. This beat ok I guess
WHERE'S PHARREL WILLIAMS
❤
❤
YAasssd
This is her old voice. Her voice has improved in the past couple years but this isn’t available here. I think she should’ve re-recorded it with a new vocal. Her hair has never looked better ❤
This song reminds me of Maneskins "I wanna be your save".
This at 2x would be a great aerobic workout track
Por que siento que comparte  con la pista de blurred lines 😬
I C O N I C
This song really gives me Måneskin vibes
SEMPRE DE BOCA ABERTA!
I'm not her fan but 'flower' and this song oh.. My god🤯
The music video is kind of like the Grammy's I think it's even the same dress
Have a really good song for you from Sweden! Post the melody for you. 😊
Crazy she made this song 12 years ago and saved it for the right moment. She was ahead of her time. Shows how talented she really is. You go girl.
the new veneer looks much better
Is this her new look or is she just recreating the Grammys outfit?
i don't understand why William's name is included while i couln't hear his voice in the song?
Her teeth are huge!!!!
Not crazy about this, looks like she is begging Liam to take her back.  She should be doing stuff to show she has dumped him and moving on very fast.
She had fun with this no doubt! Playing in all the gay bars and clubs 👏🏻
What a disappointment..
Miley always brings it!🎉🎉🎉
My queen
But this song is I wanna be your slave by Maneskin!
She beats that skin of Taylors rubbish.
Tina Turner is back! :D
Not her best song!(Or video!)Big hair don’t suit,&those prison tats gotta go!🤦‍♂️
Chameleon 💕🦋
i just don´t dig it (respectfully)
omg reinaaa
Yesss yesss yesss 아ㅏ존나좋아❤
Agregada a mi playlist de gym 💖
Not a bop or hits
Te amo mucho, Miley Cyrus
I loved it!!! With that catchy sound I can already imagine everyone posting videos with the song as background 😁
😊😊😊 Miley eres grande, recupera tu poder 😍😍😍
♥♥♥♥♥♥
❤❤❤
♥
Miley is truly iconic and confident, love seeing her shine like a diamond! 💎
the most versatile queen ever
she's just so damn cute
What a great dance banger
Loving the Tina Turner's hair ✨✨
UHH THE DANCE. I LOVE IT
❤️❤️❤️❤️
the 70, 80, 90 and 2000 combine with hip pop, disco , rock, some electric + dance of sexy + dance of shake. damn. really beautiful. this is what make people feel better. to see someone do the thing with their dream with passionate things and show it with explaining it. but no one can explained why. but just feel it, but didn't realize and assume everyone know it.
Miley Cyrus has transformed into Jane Fonda
🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
ICONIC 🎉
You look so beautiful in this video Miley
I love her❤🎉
Dioosaaaaaa❤❤❤❤❤
Ok, this time she didn’t forget her underwear 😂

https://youtu.be/fD3EaCUBf-0 🎥 When Football Moments Goes Wrong!
Te amo Miley❤
Hii
Sounds like a song originally made for Lady Gaga.
Ram ram ji https://youtube.com/@Alfaaz-e-sukoon-yp9po?si=SSvtxrnimgBSPXgv ❤
I can do ten miles on the treadmill in the gym now just listening to this song
La tesorito version eu.
When does she dance like that
So where the hell was Pharrell?
CHRISTRUMBULL ❤❤️😀👙💕👙
Blurred line pt 2
Awesome! She's so confident, a great artist.
I was here before the 10 year mark.
Hope she get a concert. I will love to watch her and work it out!
Miley Cyrus in her drag era
Ahhh I love youuu🫶🏾💕💕She can do any genre and it comes out amazing
Period get it miley
This gives 4x4 bangerz album
I love the natural looking lips💋🩷
Eat your heart out Nikki Minaj 🥳😉🙀
WOW!!!
I think everyone should be able to be as happy as she is being right here in this video. She is working it, loving it and looking like she is having the best time of her life. This is the definition of pure joy. Slay Queen Miley Slay!
I really dislike it. Usually I love all of Miley’s songs. This one isn’t for me.
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤😊
Éstoy enamorado 🎉❤
I can see the problem, it's only gon' get worse.
I'm sorry but that mane should only be worn by a lion. I can't even enjoy the song with that distraction…
❤
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
why this not trending number 1????
What's supposed to be the chorus?
Love Love this Miley you’re the bomb 💜💜Bravo on another hit 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Miley's vocals and energy carried this song 🥰 pharrell's production on the other hand 👀
Está mujer es una mega artista de nuestro tiempo, que ha tenido que pasar por muchas situaciones para darnos esto y más cosas de gran calidad
The real success at loving herself and buying herself flower. Love her transformation.
Was just me or in some parts it sounded similar to Blurred lines? It was also pharrel but with Robin Thicke
So perfect performance.. Miley Cyrus is really incredible performer..
Miley Cyrus definitely has my heart. I love her! 🫀All Smiles ... 👑YIH
I love Miley but the big hair makes her look old 😊
Somehow feels everything she did before got her ready for this moment - exceptional!
So much yes!!!! ❤
So Bad
I LOVE ME SOME MILEY CYRUS!!!
Brown hair makes her look so beautiful
La amo ❤
I could watch forever ❤❤❤
I am living for this new Miley! So incredibly talented I am so happy. This is incredible. Wow
Um. Maneskin?
❤❤❤❤❤❤ameee
A LEGEND!! So gorgeous! 😮‍💨😮‍💨🙏🏼🤍
The beginning of this song is the same riff and beat as Maneskin's "I wanna be your slave"...
I love it
Only Miley can dance like that!!! #mileydancemove❤
I didn't listen  Pharrell Williams since 2014
Boring. ...and those teeth 🤢
Miley is so free and happy, love thia video ❤❤❤
❤ a little Tina Turner🎉❤❤
I give this a 20 out of 10. The Queen is back.
Oweee ysysysbnd😂❤❤❤❤❤❤ yloveeee

Troye Sivan?
This song is terrible.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
She’s been glowing!! Love this for her
What a catchy song! Haha anything Pharrell touches becomes timeless. And Miley’s voice. Of course.   I think this is my fav hair ngl.
Me encantó ❤ se genial Miley 👑
Beyoncé had her fun little whatever, now we got a nice groovy song drop from the awesome, crazy girl herself! Woohoo
I see she went straight from the Grammys, changed into her other dress, and shot this music video. Same vibe. ❤❤❤
Impressionante como as produções do Pharrell são atemporais. Essa música tem mais de 10 anos!!!
For those asking, “Where’s Pharrell? He’s the producer of the song.
Isn’t it the grammy look?
I got "slave 4 u" by Britney Spears vibes.....I meant that as a compliment. What a natural she is. 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Tina Turner Vibes 👑❤💃
❤❤❤❤
I approve of whoever this Miley is. 😅
Holy shit, she looks PHENOMENAL HERE.
That first outfit is giving Tina Turner vibes!
Where is Pharrell Williams?
Where is perhell whillims part, thats sounded like just Miley singing, i thought it was a colab with him
Ok cmonFUNK!
she looks like she’s having so much fun 💖
20/10
Beautiful successful young lady!!! Great dad awesome daughter!! 👌 love her❤!!
IT FEELS ILLEGAL TO BE THIS EARLY
This reminds me of that Beyonce "Work it Out" song. 🥰🔥
I like the song, but some of her moves are cheesy.  She needs a choreographer.
Nice definitely a club banger
She is giving Tina Tuner with the look, stunning 🤩 she is eating! To think this song was made for her album Bangerz and didn’t make the cut… the way she made it feel so new and fresh!
She is AMAZING 👏 😍 ❤️
Love
Sucks
I'm waiting for her 2nd award 😮she got my vote
A little bit of let's get physical and flashdance going on here! With Pherell jingles and Miley's sexylisciuousness!!!  Hell yeah all day! Rock it Lady!!!! 🔥🫦💋🖕✌️🤞👌💅💃🌹🔥🫧💦🎯💄👄💋👅🌈
Blurry linesss
Turn away from the wicked ways of this world. Come to Christ, Repent and be saved. TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

Maneskin called.... They want their song back....This sounds very similar to 'I want to be your slave'.......
She is so beautiful *.*  what a cuerpower!!!
Miley (and Pharrell) are national treasures. I’m so proud this is what we (the US) offer the world. A bad ass chick, tough as nails, and sexy as hell. As well as this extraordinary  producer/artist that makes the hottest shit in the world too. Hot track. Share!!
I just saw this video on TV😂
Guess we're still gonna have to see that hair
snapped!
Maria Mercedes verse confirmado
I’ve been your fan since Hannah Montana ❤️ you are amazing!
Diosa.
Loved Miley

Made me want to listen to Maneskin
Średnie
not gonna lie but the dance moves and the song are pretty cringe.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She looks better than fucking ever 😍😚
Taylor swift is nothing compare to Miley Cyrus...very talented, best vocal, best dancer, body beautiful best and unapologetic person...An Icon and real star..
🎉top miley
i love You ❣️❣️❣️
and so the Disney princess becomes the queen <3
She looks fabulously stunning
Me encanto. ❤
why is this reminding me of her bangerz era ?! 😍
"I KNOW YOU WANT ME. I KNOW I WANT YA, I KNOW YOU WANT MEEEEHH I KNOW I WANT CHAAA" -Pitbull probably
Way to ignite life 🔥 🔥 🔥 Thanks Miley 🎶
Oh my gosh I LOVE IT 😮 ❤ YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL Absolutely obsessed with your hair style ❤
Miley living her best life. Get it Miley!
https://youtu.be/s6I0vPTwjHA?si=5y1grNwvYZlwpTD- please your style
Miley Turner ❤❤❤
i used to hate her because of her rude behaviors in the past. but her excellent comeback with flowers made me love her. Used To Be Young is an iconic song for me. I saw her inner trauma in that song. i became Miley Cyrus Fan now. Congratulations for 2 Grammy awards 🎉❤
She's a self strong confident woman love miley cyrus
I LOVE HERRRRRRRRRRR
Maneskin listening to this song...
En qué momento salía el Rafael wiliams
@traviskelce?
The body is bodying! 🔥
Does anyone know who Ann-Marget is??? ❤
Yeah!!!!!!my favorite cardiologist!!! 😉🤫🤗😷❤❤❤❤
That dress is EVERYTHING
Wow, I like the part where Pharrell Williams performed
the journey is usually the part that you remember anyways
Still stunning
Brood; All of you are only HERE to curse lives lead them to Damnation and end up in Hell on their last living day. :(
I liked flowers, but this song is a hard pass Boo
The production is basic and so is the lyrics. I can’t listen to music that doesn’t resonate with me. This sounds generic af
Mute it and play in background  I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE
Miley trang điểm ăn mặc kiểu này rất đẹp
TEMAZOOOO TEMAZOOOO TEMAZOOOO TEMAZOOOO TEMAZOOOO TEMAZOOOO 🔥
Was this video filmed right after the Grammys? lol
Miley❤
Viciei nessa música. A letra é bem legal tbm.
❤
2:09 winking time 😉
Deixando sua marca no pop ❤

Yay, Hannah Montana is back!! 😃❤️
Masterpiece❤
❤❤❤she looks flawless  Her confidence its off the h😊ook
y'all call cringe confidence ? y'all gotta be crazy
Love this kind of look from her, professional and beautiful.
the best!
I don’t get it
I love how beautifully silly she is in this! This is what pure joy and contentment looks like ☺️☺️
Never seen my network go to 8.8 mbs for a youtube video, apart from that loved the video. 😭♥️
The real fans know this from bangerz 🥰😘
YAAASSSS MAMA WORK ❤❤💕💕😍😍
JEALOUS OF HER TEETH!
Very early 2000s commercial vibes. She looks flawless. But let’s talk about this song !? So catchy 🙌🏾😭❤️
Idk if I heard this on the radio if I would care, but it's a good combination with the video.
miley nunca gasta um real com clipes 😍🥰 mt diva
This beat sounds similar to One Republic - Love Runs Out ♥️ Different word but similar to me it does. Love love LOVE it! Love you Miley ♥️
Honestly I dont even support her like that but her and her voice are worth it and she deserves multiple grammy's ( not for this obviously) so ill just wait it out
miley cyrus tiene la misma vibra que Thalía por lo menos en éste video al parecer le hizo un homenaje por "María Mercedes" telenovela clásica de los 90s Thalía es un ícono de Latinoamérica y reconocida en Norteamericana y centroamérica etc...
sound great
Revolutionary.
❤❤❤
Love her look!
ate omg
Was this even a song? Terrible production.
Best of our time
Best of our time
That let me work me out line reminds me of another song can't figure w/c one🤔
❤❤❤❤❤Perfect😍
Loved it. Beautiful song.
I’m loving this song. Waaaay much much better than Flowers. I hope this becomes another hit for her, even though she’s nuts she deserves it.
Blurred lines 2.0, but I love it!
O Brasil te ama
Miley to the Super Bowl!!!!
Copying maneskin much?
REINAAAAAAAA
All I hear are the remixes. That are gonna come from this sample. Just because it sounds like blurred lines.
New video musical for live action King's Lion movie.
Classic.
SHE'S HOT, BUT! this vibe is kinda stolen from one republic.  I ain't mention the song. Still she.mixed it up .and BTW she looks like Jane fonda did when she was younger.
Divinaaa!!! ❤
Looks like blurred lines i love it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love Miley ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Boppp
Millie is way too good for this video wth is this. Lots can be said for big hair and out fits, but missed this time😢
Love how she enjoys the things she does 🙂
Look at the quality of this video OMG <3
Lo malo de la canción 3:03
I'm 64 and I LOVE MILEY and this song😁♥️😁💙❤️💖💚

Where is Pharrell Williams????????????????????????????????????????
Great dress...but that hair is...hmm 🤔
Legendary
This is the most fun I've seen her have in years
Miley icónica como siempre! De las mejores voces que tiene el mundo hoy en día
❤❤❤❤
This is low key reminding me of the “Do It” music video. Iconic.
😂 I love this, but all I hear is Maneskin. Did she sample them or reverse if this was an old song like I’ve heard others say?
Miley is such a performer! I’ve enjoyed every video I’ve seen of hers.  I’m here for it! 😍
She’s Fantastic
Fire her stylist ASAP
Love it love it love it! Is it weird that I’m a 50 year old women mother if 3 grown children and want to jam to her songs ! 😊
1/03/2024💔
Great music as always
This is going to be one for the books!
maria Mercedes jajaj

Sure enough,Miley's appearance is so hot !🔥 ❤
Me encanta este estilo de movimientos muy Miss Tina Turner
Un homenaje a tina Turner, cool 😀
she needs a second grammy! wohoo!
The top section of this video is def channeling the current country queen Beyonce'- All the Single Ladies
Her confidence is on full display!!! Miley is out there saying "I'm beautiful, I know it and I'm going to show it and I'm going to enjoy it"🔥
It's a no for me.🤷‍♀️
Miley has really grown into a really confident woman
This has got to be Miley's response to Beyonce doing country.
❤❤❤
I love her hair and I love her foot/leg tap at the beginning!! ❤️✨🤩  Great work-out song for Cardio!!  Flowers was my Walking or Warm up Song!  30’s looks Great on Miley!!👄✨🥰
❤
❤❤
Horrible song
❤
❤
big hair is like sculpture on the scalp. i hope it’s coming back because it’s so cool
❤
Pharrel has the power to ruin every artist he works with. Great job, really.
❤
I love Hannah Montana and by the way I’m seven years old and my name is zahara
LOVE YOU,GIRL❤😂
Soy yo? O Miley cada año se parece más a Kylie Minogue! Lo digo en el parecido físico de cuando ella tenía su edad.
El ritmo muy bueno, pero me quede en la espera de que saliera Pharrell Williams 🫠
Lol it's like staring at a tooth pick trying to dance.
I need some miley in my life😂
Miley Cyrus from 2010 it's you?
The queen of pop is back 🎉🎉🎉🎉

Glad you're having fun

Какое платье, светится и искрится! Красотка😍
The NEW song for singing in KARAOKE unlocked🔓❤️‍🔥
This song celebrates the music career of Mother! ❤
whatever era she's entering...the hair...the fits...I am soooooo strapped in. I'm always strapped in for her, but this is sooooooooooo
🩶🩶🩶

Great singer and song 🎶
Get out of satan system and get in God system before it’s to late .
Uau!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
DIVAAAA
Perfec ❤❤
Beautiful, unique voice.
Oh My good!!!!!
I miss this kind of MV!!
at the start isn’t there a sample of a pharrel song?.. I can’t put my finger on what song it is
okay I'm living for the return of dance routines in pop music
You look gorgeous Miley well done.
I just love her sm
Queen of pop
I start to like her wearing her hair like that.
MILEY YOUR TEAM IS DOING AMAZING JOB !!!! YOU LOOK BETTER THAN EVER HONEY !!!!
I love Miley, though how is her videos really that original then a Beyoncé or Jlo? I mean for sure the can use their bodies in an any way they choose; let's be honest & SEE the similarities of certain female performers.  Best creative videos for me was the 80's. AND these lyrics "yawn"
Tina is that you?
Proud of you Miley!! You deserve that Grammy!! ❤️
Yes Please!
She looks fantastic! And has really come a long way since Hannah Montana.  It has been a joy to watch her mature into the beautiful young woman she has become. A true professional artist. At the ripe old age of 74, I will continue to follow her amazing career. A total joy to watch & listen to.  Keep on keepin' on Miley! ❤❤❤😊
Excellent ❤❤❤
FANTASTICCC!!!
Grandona sem medo
A briga tá entre ela, e a Dua Lipa nao sei quem eu amo mais
I MISS U, BANGERZ ERA! ❤❤❤
Marimar ao, eso todo el estilo de thalia
ti amo mileeeey
mother, do português mãe
Tina all ova
I don’t like the song
Maravilhosa 🔴🔴🔴🎧🎧🎧
i want doctor Miley
Pqp, que mulher linda do caralho ❤
She is the best!
Nossa hannah montana cresceu 🥹♥️
She reminds me of Grace Jones. Both so fiercely themselves.
The American Laura Leon.
Super sexy n different
Te amamos 💘💘
Miley versailty is INSANE!  Love this song & video
Certified Gold!!!!!!😎
I don’t like the Hair…. So not Miley Cyrus❌❌❌❌
It's giving Tina Turner vibes ❤
incredibly cool!
She is enjoying it and I am enjoying it too
Is she gonna have a mix....
Maneskin influence is still on board I guess 😛
Love🫦
Good💋🍀
아주 완벽하고 훌륭해요 나는 당신을 매우 사랑하고 존경합니다
te amoooo tina cyrussssss
💌Love❤ Cyrus
Terrible
Miley ❤
Me encanto
Awesome 👏👏👏 reminds me of Prince. Like a song he would write, I wonder if she was inspired by him. 😊
Miley is bringing back 2000's music videos vibes and I'm here for it.
She looks like her mooom
I wonder what she gonna live
Que reina ❤
Loved Pharrell's part 😂
The chorus is a nice nod to Maneskin’s big hit
Matou o ESV mesmo hein
here in 2024
🤤🔥
Absolutely jaw dropping
I love the song 🥺🩷🤍 so amazing congratulations Miley and Pharrell this song is perfect 🤌🏻😍 makes me dance 🪩🩰🥰
Te amoooo mulherrrrrrrrrrr ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing I love it ❤
This is my first GRAMMY.........🎉🎉
Miley is EVERYTHING
Who heard the 4 count? :)  Great vibes in this song!
Im he’s doctor 🥼
Her teeth are making me feel crazy
👏 such a fun song
So Måneskin
i love it
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
MOTHER !
AM STILL LOOKING FOR PHARRELL WILLIAMS IN THIS SONG............😅😤😤😤😡😡😡 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its sounds to much like måneskin supermodelbi think, but still cool
We need a Mariah Collab - E=MC2 ❤❤❤
Miley's better than this silly, throw away song.
eu ameeei!!
I genuinely think it’s the best pop song that came out since 2020
Song of the year
Why am I hearing a sample from Beyoncé’s ‘Work It Out’!
And the Winner for Best Pop Duo Performance is “Doctor (Work It Out)” by Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus - 2025 Grammys
Miley is perfect but this song is a FLOP, Pharell is super bad, your music is very bad
I wanna be Your Slave, Doctor
Lioness
No closed captions? Tf
miley
Finally Miley is getting the appreciation she deserves!!!!!
Omg Miley reminds me of Gloria trevi the look I love her her music Gloria's and Miley both are very rocker chic vibes .
OMG!!! Can’t wait for more … ❤❤
2.214
Pure star power and style. I love the direction of the camera and the editing in this video.
I feel like I just watched a 👀 TOOTH commercial 🦷 With them pearly white teeth. 😁
Simplemente la amo! Bellísima 🥹❤️
Not her best
Ajá...lo mismo digo dónde está Pharrel😊 creo que fue un toque de inspiración .... excelente Miley
DIVAAAAAA
Amazing I love this!!
wow
Woah!
She’s in her short sparkly dress era and I’m here for it
Looks like very humourous. But looks, like artist  doesn’t believe or doesn’t understand what she’s doing.
Full bloom of Miley.. She's the flower 🌸
I’m getting strong Lisa LeBlanc vibes from this.
I don't like her music
I have goosebumps. Mileeeyyyyy🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️
Anyone else hear blurred lines?!?…. Is this the full circle moment
Grammy are you? 👀
Videoclip of 100 dollars
This song by Miley was 🔥
This is a grown woman not trying to please anyone or get any attention.  We love this Miley. ❤ You have your own stage, own it mama we are here for it.
❤
Uy, que malito 🤧 me estoy poniendo. Me voy directo al hospital, a ver si me encuentro una doctora como tú Miley. Para que me hagas el - boca a boca -, o algo así. A ver si me reanimas.... 🎙️ 54 de los 70,a 🔝 de 😎
This sounds like her old voice ???
Somehow the "I could be your doctor" part reminds me of Måneskin's "I wanna be your slave"
I’m sad that there’s no doctor, nurse, hospital imagery/story in this
She looks so much like her mom in this video
Irremediablemente sexy, incansablemente bella
É essa miley icônica que queremos ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Te amo Miley 💗
Cant wait fitness influencer to turn this into a workout video 😂
Amazing song an video, this rythm is a bop
BEAUTIFULLL
Yay new music from Miley! 💗
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Ela tá tão linda, tão confiante, plena, feliz 🥰
BEAUTIFUL
Iconic
Miles is a multi talented artist, she could sing anything unlike most!❤ She looks absolutely gorgeous, sexy & fit! Her hair & dress is phenomenal ❤
❤❤❤
Omg
It’s giving harry styles energy
Love Miley but I don’t like the song
It feels like an Uptown Funk vibes in a female version and I love it. For this, it is now my new top favorite. 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
She's having a total blast & that elevates the hell outta this video. Got a feeling this chick would be a helluva lot more fun to hang out with than any of her contemporaries 🎉🎉🎉
Definitely not the Miley I’m used to seeing but I like it 🤷🏽‍♀️
She looks and sounds fantastic, she is going thru her tina turner phase and its great
I hope Miley Cyrus has a lot more of these coming out soon! Is this part of a new album? ❤❤❤❤❤
Love the hotter version of Miley right now. 🤩🔥👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is POP perfection ❤
This is Hannah Montana, not Miley
Werk it out girlie 💚
Loving this new song, so full of fun ❤😅😊
I love her hair everyone else can buzz off. It's great
Nice just get one beat more sometimes especially at the start
straight up from the grammy to record this 😋
This is maneskin.. ah no
That was wonderfully trashy. She pulled it off perfectly.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Despues de ganar su grammy se fue a grabar una nueva cancion ... que increible
Its like Blurred Line and H&M commerical had a baby
Beyonce? Anybody?
Que energía electrizante 😘
What a boring song 😂😂😂Esse
Another banger love you Miley!
“Zaddy!😆” She said🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
Me pasa que encuentro q es una canción super plana, sin climax. Es muy típico de Farrel. Una buena base rítmica y una cantante talentosa no basta para hacer un éxito. Me faltó algo en la canción.
Volvieron los 80S, 👙👠👠
HIT AFTER HIT BABY LOVE...
Love this Jazzercise
Loves it queen❤
MILEY I LOVE YOU!!!! I did a reaction video on my channel! Please come let me know your thoughts as well! 🤩😊
Where is Pharrel?
Omg this is so FUCKING cool.
This song in my airpods makes me feel like im in a catwalk!
🤨🤨🤨Maneskin???
7/10
miley ❤
queen miley
Excuse me why is sounding like I wanna be your slave from maneskin in the beginning help
amo
se vé y escucha genial ❤👏
queen
Que mulher radiante ❤‍🔥#DIVA
🎉
Mi bb❤❤
❤😍❤🤩🤯🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Miley saw us loose it iver her Grammy look and she decided to give us more. And I bow down.
She’s everything people think Taylor Swift is
Thanks to her GodMa Dolly? she is so sober and  hot right now. Everything works! Everything she touches is gold!  The song will go viral! She executes it to the tee!
🔥🔥🔥
Y esta por que le esta copiando a la Gloria Trevi con doctor psiquiatra jajajaj
I’m living for the 80s hair!
She age like a wine! She looks good and her music is getting better!
I’m feeling the 80s soap villain meets Mob wife vibes
Just watching her having fun is putting me in a good mood
Waooo una vez más demostrando su talento, me encantó ❤ Saludos desde Cuba 🙋‍♀️
The song is boring, but her energy is DAAAAAAAYUUUUM❤❤❤❤❤ LOOOOVE IT
Always amazing!!! ❤
Obsessed!!!
This is trash as hell
I love her. Huge fan. And I’ve never not liked anything of hers. But I’m not feeling the song. I just don’t like the beat? She’s gorgeous though…..
Was this a part of Bangerz album or am I delulu?
Have you noticed she rarely has a male on her music video
I love every version of Miley, but this one 😮‍💨
Terrible
She really looks like her mom here.
Where is Pharrell?
Fun!
I didn't really see hey until the wrecking ball song and her hair was super short then.  Shes always evolving. Then she was on the voice as a coach.  I was watching for pharell war he back up singer.  Couldn't tell.
I wasn't sure about this song the first time I heard it, but it is certainly growing on me - quickly!  Hope it turns into a huge hit for her.
The brown hair looks devine on her ✨
I was sure this was "Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley at the beginning
Very nice ozempic body though
Music video remind me of destination unknown
She looks so fresh on this video
This is the calmest video ive seen of miley
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
This is an old song from 2013… people are recycling trash music nowadays
Incredible talet Miley❤
Love me sum Miley!👌🏾❤️❤️
Grammy
The WORLD need really womans, I live you Work Miley , Thanks ❤
Sounds like « I wanna be your slave » from Måneskin
REINA❤
Turning 30 is the best time of life 😊
Maravilhosa amo Miley ❤
She's clearly been with dolly a lot. I love it
This is music that makes you feel good, confident and makes you move💃🏽
Amazing tune !!!!
SHE'S SO NATURAL, SO CONFIDENT, SO GOOD.
The music isn’t anything I’ll want to hear
Miley has really grown into a really confident woman
DRA MILEY CYRUS CUIDARÁ DISSO
Homely Skank
I was so liking u! And then u put out this trash.. why?
Chocada que o Pharrell conseguiu fazer uma música boa pra uma diva pop
7 things vibe 🤣 comedy is her personality
This is so gay. I’m here for it
She's an icon, she's a legend and she is the moment
Congrats, the song healed me 🌬🎻=♾💎=💲👦
Tina Turner vibes ❤
Hey Howard Stern, 🖕 The Queen is here... and she is gorgeous and talented.
Come on, I think Im in love...😍❤   The outfit,music,dance,SMILE....congrats to both of you guys.   And please,COME TO BRAZIL GIRL..🇧🇷
I love that even if the video was muted, you can still have fun just by seeing her having fun
Tina Turner vibes ❤
This is so FIRE !! and Miley is effortlessly SEXY!!
I love yoouuuuuu❤
i never stopped loving miley. she is AN ICON
She’s celebrating her womanhood and looking gorgeous while doing it. Healthy and fit 🫶❤️🔥♥️ She is giving body body
Que energia tan increíble la de esta mujer ❤
Who's here waiting for Pharell to come out in the vide?
Os olhares que ela fez nesse clipe me lembraram a Mariah Carey
Exceptional ; more !
I’m seeing visual nods to Tina Turner and Cher’s 70’s Bob Mackie stage costumes. I haven’t acknowledged the Beyoncé references because she also referenced Tina, so we might as well honour the source material. ❤
mi polola, la mujer mas guapa del mundo
Yaaaaaaas Queen
ATE. LEFT NO CRUMBS. EVERYONE HUNGRY. EVERYONE STARVING. PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS CAUSE THERE IS NO FOOD LEFT.  ICON!!!!!!!!
I give this a 20 out of 10. The Queen is back.
Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE (sounds similar?)
Oh Miley Miley Miley you nailed this again 💝
No he parado de sonreír, mientras veía el video ¿A alguien más le pasó lo mismo? Hermosa MILEY, LOVE UUUUU
Finally a girl that is confident, not weird and showing what a good healthy body looks like.
Its giving QUEEN
Am I looking at Beyonce or Miley Cyrus?
Great voice dancing not  so much
It gets no better 😍
What's with the Piggly Wiggly Mennonite hair?
The one and only MILEY CYRUS!!!! An icon. A legend. A rockstar. A GRAMMY GRLLL
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
She ghosted her dad but she resuscitated his mullet 🙌
Nə irəmc bədənin var
What I see is a grown woman, a mature artist in the peak of her career... Wearing black, gold and her stunning body. She enjoyed and fight for each step in it. Well done. Saludos @MileyCyrus Éxitos en todo 🎉🎉🎉
Pharrel que maravilha esse clipe 🎶👍😍
Sounds like something Dua Lipa would sing ❤
she needed a hunky (or a nerdy) patient and match the lyrics to the video story telling.  it pays to have a great video producer.
This is hard to watch just like that Grammys performance
Listening on repeat as I make my way to church lol uh oh the ear worm will be with me throughout like Jesus 😆
Mano eu amei essa vibe Stefanny Absoluta! ❤❤❤❤
That iconic 4-count before Pharrell is about to eat on the production
I hope Miley brings back this type of hair  style for trending 😭😭😭like I wanna live  like the 80s for once
Is it just me or is she paying homage to Tina Turner?  I felt the same about her look and performance at the Grammys
NEW HIT 🔥 SMELLS #1 BILLBOARD
Queen 🩵
This is horrible
Eres hermosa y cantas fabulosamente bien
The lady’s having fun!! Lol I love to see her having an absolute f*ing blast. 😁💃🏽❤️‍🔥
Is Miley bringing back 80s pop? Cuz it feels like it, and i am Here for it!!! ❤❤
Great song 🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️
Love it
But where is Pharrell Williams ?
Suena como a una canción desechada para un albúm
Te amooooo ❤❤❤❤❤ pura perfección
so freakin awesome
Wow!! Let me say, I actually enjoyed that and I absolutely LOVE her hair. I wonder if that is really her length of hair. It’s so pretty.
Já imagino ela fazendo uma performance dessa música no grammy do ano que vem.❤😊
Beat like thriller Michael Jackson
Jane Fonda lol
AMOOOOO  the best
pissed every time you release and it's not a rock song, but it's still Miley4Life. Work it out then bitch!
Hipnotic 😍💣
When Will Miley come to perform in Brazil? I'm anxiously wainting❤❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I’m disappointed. It’s just okay!!  I DO like the awkward choreography tho!

The look is giving Tina Turner
Not a soul was ready!😂
I think montana might be shining through 🎉😊
She's beautiful. Love her raspy voice and her outfits.
WWOOOOOOOWWWW
Miley looks hella fine in that video.
Caramba Que Gata!!
Stupidest dance moves I've ever seen. Totally pretentious. Why do women feel like they have to plaster "graffiti" all over their bodies?
I love Miley with all my heart ❤️ but this song was not that good.. unfortunately but maybe it will grow, with that said, it was a epic video though but the song, nah, hope for a new full length album soon and that this queen starts to tour again! We need you in Europe Miley! One of my biggest dream is to see Miley Live some day and that you play some more songs live from the album younger now! Younger now is maybe my all time favorite album with Miley, so many good songs that needs to be played live, like bad mood, love someone, thinkin and she’s not him 🥰 and of course my all time favorite song with Miley: Slide Away 🎶❤️
Hot damn!!!!!! Could she be anymore of a sec bomb???? Uplifting was feeling @#$& dis morning but am bopping around lounge room and on mardi gras eve in Syd!!! Keep working it U sexy Thang!!!! Love ducky from Sydney ❤
So GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!
I need a doctor to cure my addiction to this music video
WHAT. A. GODDESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me encanta, voz, belleza y fuerza. Saludos de 🇨🇴😍
The 4 same notes at the beginning, and we know that it's *him* who made the song :D
Rockstar✨
she didn't changed from her grammy win ....    xD
Deusa, Te amo🖤
Did Miley inherit Tina Turner’s wardrobe?
Maravilhosa ❤❤❤
Mileyyyy ❤👏🏼🥲🥹 She’s back ❤
She reminds me of Anahi here
Gorgeous
She deserves a new hairstylist 😱
No one will ever touch this performance.
Miley cured my depression so many times
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Beautiful video, beautiful song, you are so beautiful.❤❤❤❤.💙💙💙💙.
Queen slay ❤❤❤
Sound like they tried to remake blurred lines.
Great Maneskin cover 😂. Love Milye but.. 🎉
Ah!😂
The crossover 🤗
❤❤❤
So is the Angelina Jolie doppleganger look on purpose? Or am I seeing things?
Farrah faucet vibe
What a rubbish song. And flowers was a rip off of Bruno’s song.
So good
Please use caption ❤
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The meaning of the song is  N 👏 A 👏 S 👏 T👏 Y 😜
I think this is secretly just a hair commercial?? Sickening
Good song Miley. Work it out You finally grow up to be a beautiful young lady.😊
What did pharrel Williams do in this song?
Werk!!!
I never really liked her but she looks so damn good you go Miley.
¡Que hermosa se ve en todo el video!
❤❤❤❤
Perhaps a tribute to Tina Turner? The hair and outfit certainly look very similar.
Uuuuuhh i love it
What's our Pherrell upto now  ? 🙃😆😀 sounds good
This song is a smash.  I want to watch this video 300 more times.
This song is FUN 🎉
She looks like she is legitimately having fun and i love it!
Her hair is AMAZING!
giving 2024 version of blurred lines lmao
Yup still😂
Yes my queen😍🥰🫶👑💛
Mother is mothering as mothers should
🇲🇽🇲🇽❤️‍🔥
Grammy winner baby 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fitness lovers will like this song. Good for working out.
Her energy is electrifying 💫🌟
I love all of  Miley cyrus songs there so good.
Linda demais!❤
Miley es una chica hermosa, con una gran energía, tienes una voz maravillosa, una persona sencilla, natural en todo sentido... Soy una mujer de 62 años pero me encanta la música actual y tus canciones me gustan mucho...tu feeling, tu simpatía, tu alegría!!! No cambies y vive tu propia felicidad... Sigue disfrutando de lo que haces y cantar lo haces de maravilla!!! Te mando un gran abrazo desde México.
MOTHER IS MOTHERING🔥🔥🔥
LOVE IT SO MUCH OMG !
Am I the only one who hears Maneskin in the beginning?
Vibe Single Ladies
Het nee OWN style I like❤
It’s terrible
This sounds like MANESKIN…I wanna be your slave..
Miley you 're so iconic i LOVE you. ❤
Ooh hello, Maneskin😊
❤❤❤❤❤
That's our Miley, gorgeously fit. The song is bop
lacrou
Talk yo shit Miley!    Yassssssss💜
Tina turner vibes , and I appreciate the natural lips and no fillers 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️
She’s so confident and I love it. I’m even skinnier than her and a lot of time it’s makes me self conscious because I just don’t gain weight even though I eat a lot and drink protein shakes and work out to build muscle. And seeing her so confident when being judge by millions of people in her revealing outfits always gives me so much respect for her. Love you Miley screw the haters. People are always gonna hate whether someone is fat or really skinny. I’m proud of you! Thanks for being an inspiration to dress and be however no matter what body type.
Winner winner miley.
Ela e linda
Lucky us 😂🎉❤😮😢😅😊
FIRST GLANCE? I SEE SOMEONE TRYING TO LOOK LIKE TINA TURNER & DOLLY PARTON IN ONE ..... FIND YOUR OWN LANE
oh gosh this woman is an absolute legend  I ADORE HERRRRR
Exceptional.
❤❤❤
Can we place replace all of the lame Beyonce "country" songs with THIS?! 🔥
❤
I love Miley, really... but I'm also Italian so I couldn't help but notice this sounds a lot like Maneskin...
The new hair is not Miley Cyrus …  Please 🥺 the old haircolor and cut
Te amo
ilove love this era of mileyyyy
I am still her3 😂
Diggin her new hair, shes like a fine wine, gettin better over time
Not too excited about this music production by Pharrell Williams. Kinda of a letdown. Compared to other songs produced by Pharrell.
https://youtu.be/yOb9Xaug35M?si=phYuIP1JBIYxlLoO
❤❤❤
She did this Late but better than never 🎉
Nice!
Her energy is everything, I love to watch her nowadays!
Yay! Flowers then this. This is the Miley we want to see! ❤ happily dancing and singing
Thats Tina Turner ft Måneskin! #not good!
I loved 😍
Love the Britney dance moves
Ok, mainstream music is good again.
❤
❤❤❤
the queen
Pharell the légende
Now I need to release "nightmare" ❤ or “last goodbye”
Well, that’s the same thing, the coolest moment is when you are like at the Grammys the last part of the performance your style your voice your version, I fell in love again and still can’t tear myself away after your cover of Zombie, stay a rock and roll girl ❤
This is the definition of confidence !!! Miley's out there saying "I'm gorgeous, I know it and I'll show it and will enjoy it". Bravo, I'm all for it!!!
we see a new Queen? omg
🛐✨
Me gustaba más como Hanna Montana
Sounded familiar to me  https://youtu.be/j2Nxsxo2Khw?si=7nsDwKSmAOlZk3me
The dress looks so good on her.
I fucking adore u woman
CADÊ O Pharrell Williams??????
Why she is not bigger then Taylor Swift is puzzling to me. 💕
Perfection achieved.
Why is she dancing like that?
I wanna know which hair products and techniques used to get get that volume 😍
pharrell doesn’t miss ❤ good stuff miley and p 🔥
love this new song, Miley is a strong woman ! without go thru the hardship will not appreciate her triumph go girl !
Getting maneskin with I Wanna Be Your Slave

Impresionante Miley. Sin palabras
CONTEXTOOOOO

Those hits!🤯
Legal mas cadê o Pharrell?
Me encantooooo ❤
I love this woman more than anything ever.
Floored. Party in the evej in there.
Gives Jane Fonda vibes ❤
Miley is literally the cutest
What's she doing? Farting and then waving it away?
Cuidado! Você está mexendo em um dos maiores legados do mundo da música que é o álbum Endless summer vacation, que inclui a música mais tocada do planeta em 2023, então continue Miley, mas tome conhecimento disso ❤
One of the best to ever do it. And quickly! 😢

Genius.

🌹🌹🌹
I remember when😮‍💨
Vai tocar no Celebration JB FM no ano 2050
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
One of thee hottest things I've ever heard or seen in my life. Entire 😂
The beginning reminds me of Maneskin
The hair is... hairin'!!!!
You can make a cheap and lazy written song and it still sells when the singer got a name.
Miley back ❤❤❤❤
Amazing teeth
Reinona ❤ Cuando se tiene esa carisma, confianza en sí misma, talento vocal y cuerpazo, no se necesita tanta producción ni bailarines de fondo para sobresalir. Ni siquiera soy super fan de Miley y la estoy amando.
The veneers are veneering
The greatest!!!!!
Horrible song. Did she even change her clothes from the Grammys?
My favorite  thing  about  this is the hair and dress are so  similar  to how she looked at the  Grammys,  almost  wonder if she did it in honor  of her 1st Grammy.. also look at her 🥹 she's so healthy  and tone 🫶
¿Por que no canta pharrell Williams?
Brillant
Miley is one of the few people starring as a model, singer, goddess, dancer (she reminds me of ol school Tina Turner here) and could  be sitting next to you in a bar as well.
This gramma loves this girl My Golden Goddess❣️ And I can only hope a certain someone is eating his heart out 💖🫵🏻💝👵🏻🥰🤭😁
So very talented go girl 🎉🎉🎉
The perfect example of a self-confident woman; love it!
Such a catchy pop song
Preciosa ❤❤❤
The hairography!
🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷
Sounds like Maneskin.
She is beautiful 😮😮
Yo vine por Pharrell, ¿donde esta?

Gorgeous Miley ❤
Iconic.
Where is Pharrell??
Still 😂
This is a MC song. Where on earth is Pharrell Williams?
Seems like everyone is just dancing Wednesday's moves nowadays
Michael Jackson's sound is in the air everywhere in this song and, lately, quite a lot everywhere (Usher's Halftime superbowl)
You go Miley!!!
wow this had me dancing in my seat, so groovy and upbeat. lifted my mood %100
Eu estou louco ou, a cada dia, a Miley está mais parecida com a Anahí do RBD?
You look so good. That funky vibe is everything. All you do is get better and better. This is so hot.❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Diosaaaaaa
So disappointing.
GOOD!!!!👍
She warned us she couldn't be tamed
Adictivo

Great title, what energy, Tina Turner look and an air of Lauren Hutton, a famous 70's model !
Director: "During which part of the video do you want the fan to be on? Miley: Yes 😁😍

The production is sooo soo pharell!! But the question is when He take ths time to do this with his schedule at Vuitton??

We need a halftime show from her!!!
❤

The lyrics and the visuals are so fun. I love it
Miley Cyrus ft. Maneskin I felt that 🤩
love this masterpiece. we waínt more music miley
miley is such a light
the ultimate hymn when u had a bad day and wanna feel better.
Hottest thing I've ever heard.
such relevant lyrics
I love this song.
im definitely a Smiley now.
Beauty
mileys song choices are always so random and unpredictable and i love her for it
Miley Cyrus now that's a pretty hot video I'll catch you after while
my mom showed me this and im obsessed
"Reclaiming" doesn't even begin to describe the genius, but it's the most poignant descriptive word I have for this. Jolly good show
Free.
I love how original she is. She is just HERSELF, she doesn't try to be anyone, unlike some singer do. Original, good at singing, a good carreer behind her. The next generations won't never have such good and original artists.
Ok I'm obsessed with this song already!!!! I love it hands down love it! Loving the vibe and the dance moves! She's beautiful and loving this Era omg❤
She was born a man.
miley u are everything
Lets stream this song everybody
why are people sleeping on this masterpiece
If you wanted me to lay on the floor u just had to ask. 😮‍💨
❤❤❤❤❤
what a vibe
So ducking pretty ❤
amazing song
this dress shes wearing is absolutely gorgeous
She is a real Rock Star!
Everyone here praising Miley now but a few years ago talking mad crap...gtfoh!  Go listen to Dead Pets (her 2nd best album after Bangerz) and tell me you still love her. 🤔
Dumb
go miley show us what u got
I love this side of her❤
pop girlie Miley is back!!!!
queen of dance moves
Wow she is breath-taking
Miley looks tf good!!!
I just requested it on the radio
I'm literally obsessed with this song. I played it in my car so loud that the whole street could hear it lmao
The best singer of the moment!
Love this girl to much ♥ 🇧🇷
this is my new anthem
Am I the only one who immediately hears Maneskin - I Wanna Be Your Slave?
I’m really loving how Miley’s found music that lets her showcase the uniqueness and sound of her voice!
What an original idea
Miley is the new main pop girlie whether u like it or not
okay Miley is carrying 2024 on her shoulders
I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
I’m here for this 🎉
No but this song is everything ❤
My mom is going to be so excited that big hair is back, if it comes back officially -as she is trying lol. That dress is bomb she is wearing. Song is catchy I guess
this is the best power banger ever
WHAT A WOMAN 🤩
Je'taime Miley❤
When a song comes out and awesome energy and is fun to watch. You don’t need anyone else to dance with or for. Dance like you are the only person in the room/space. Thank you Miley
Te amo Miley❤
Nunca decepciona ❤ tiene todo este nueva canción baile ,alegría todo Perfecto y está hermosa ella cómo siempre 🥰🥰
She is a true artist!

SHES SO FCK PRETTY AND CONFIDENT
showstopping song
only real diva moves
Cuuute😊
iconic
baby miley
she saved me
I’m always intrigued by Cyrus and enjoy her music, but this is so far below what she’s capable of. If I saw this and didn’t know her other work, I would immediately dismiss her.  Her confidence is there but that’s where the good is over. The “dancing” is laughable and the lyrics are amateurish. I’m all about her self discovery, but go back to giving us top quality performances and videos like when you released Flowers.
Miley is the reason im still alive. literally
ICONIC ✨
Slay the house down boots
Slay mama
Work it out queen
Like si crees que Miley Cyrus debería presentarse el próximo año en el súper bowl
Watching this has been my turning point.
This is my favorite channel.
Canta, baila, se roba la cámara y es bella❤
miley is so addictive
She's so peppy, love her 10,000!
oh Mi Ley
Miley is blossoming. So happy she’s found her niche and is going with it!
THE MASTERPIECE OF MASTERPIECES ❤👑👏
This is 100% breathtaking
Sounds like something the band Maneskin would sing
Amazingly done video
Where is the Pharell Williams part.  Such Click-bait.
Make it go number 1 !!

epic music video and song. great job miley and pharell!
this is ICONIC
miley is the best so far
go miley go
Miley is a real talent, not just a product of marketing like TS who can barely sing. Luv Miley who raises the bar on what is considered talent

This is sick
Party

Like Kylie Minoque before years…
Nice mash up of I wanna be your slave & Blurred Lines vibes 😊
👎👎👎👎👎 So bad
Go girl Go
Love Miley but this song is terrible
She's so disgusting
No-one else thinks this sounds like Maneskin's song?

I just love Miley! She’s talented, smart, has stage/performance presence, and she’s not trying to shove herself down our throats with fifty versions of an album or song. 🤔 A star!
Song isn’t my favorite but She looks so good 😍
WOW truly love it. Her best moment. Reminds me of Tina when Tina was 50 years old.
Espectacularmente icónica, 💥💥
Legend.
Amo su energía, es muy de rock star 😍 Lo que el género rock no nos da hoy en día, nos lo da Miley 😂❤
yez, she will be a LEGEND.....
proudly a Miley fan since probably 2008. I loved all her songs and every change, but finally everyone can see how AMAZING she is and what a voice she has. And finally she won the Grammy she always deserved!!!! GO MILEY, so proud of you and so proud that everyone is appreciating you now
Didn't realise I was strung out before this. Oh. My. God.

Didn’t like her earlier stuff but as she has grown she is simply superb and only getting better. Go Miley ❤
Unica ❤️
She’s just in a studio, but she looks like she’s having the time of her life 🤣

I was a never a fan but I like this new Miley, great songs, great performances
Who still replaying it?
Miley is awesome! I like Taylor Swift but all her songs have the same sound and subjects and her dancing is always the same. I believed Miley has a much better voice!
From grinding on Robin Thick to riding his wave. Congrats, At this point she'll have robin thick grinding on her in a teddy while she performs at the VMA's.
I want her beautiful face, perfect body and her attitude 😩🥹♥️
I Love this ❤❤❤❤❤
Is this her Grammy’s look?
I think it’s so ironic that this song reminds a lot of „Blurred lines“ as she did the performance back then with Robin Thicke 😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
In love with it, it rocks!
Bref, j’aime pas du tout
this interpretation of Miley is super, I need a doctor, for the pains of love I feel for her...
This is giving young Jane Fonda 😍
i love u miley! 😭

Miley's new hair is not a good look.

Miley gets better and better!
Forgettable af
This sounds too familiar. ... Beyoncé work it out....
Forgettable as fuck.

Looks like Miley is the only artist in this generation who truly knows how to reinvent herself--a true artist who doesn't release the same crap every era.
Epic!
This is cute! Thoroughly enjoyed🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I sincerely don't understand why people liked this, but I sense that I'll have to like it too because it is going play everywhere 🫠
Miley saw us loose it iver her Grammy look and she decided to give us more. And I bow down.
ya tengo la canción perfecta para empezar las mañanas
❤❤
ammazza se si sente che te e i Maneskin c'avete o' stesso omino che schiaccia i bottoni della musica
Love the song, love the video, Love Miley.   Totally awesome as usual.  You go girl.
Okropne
Today I feel 10 years younger!! Thank YOU Miley Cyrus ♥

Plot twist: Miley creates different personas for each of her albums she is what Hannah Montana couldn’t be.
Maneskin vibes❤

New??
God I love her
Molto bella Lei e anche la canzone ❤⬆️💯💋
How is this 18 trending and cardi b 1 trending miley has more views
Tina Turner just died last year. Isn't this kinda wrong to swagger jack her as a style both at the grammys and now as a music video? Asking for a friend. It's def kinda weird.
My favorite  thing  about  this is the hair and dress are so  similar  to how she looked at the  Grammys,  almost  wonder if she did it in honor  of her 1st Grammy.. also look at her 🥹 she's so healthy  and tone❤ 😭🫶
https://youtu.be/uZNYA0o6S8M?si=4tEt_jRkBBSvgx7N
Podría ser tu enfermera 😊😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
everything about this reminds me of Rachelle Rak, the power in miley holds is out of this world
I miss her rock side when she looks like new Debbie Harry with a pink nails.
Loveee this song ❤
Benim bildiğim tek bi doktor şarkısı var o da doktooor derdimee bul bi çareee... Bu şarki ne ki? Bizi kesmezzzz

Sempre em bom!!! Artista dos pés à cabeça.
her vocals are so much more confident than in the demo version from years ago
She has gotten weird !
the first verse reminded me of maneskin's "i wanna be your slave"
She looks GENUINELY happy!!!  Go Miley!!!
My English exam ended and Miley Cyrus just dropped another banger! Her music is always energetic and motivating.

It's good, but give it a thumbs up if you also think she should make more music like Foreigner, Tina Turner and Cher

When a song comes out and awesome energy and is fun to watch. You don’t need anyone else to dance with or for. Dance like you are the only person in the room/space. Thank you Miley
so iconic
Pharrell Williams uses to many samples that sounds to much like other songs.  why he gets sued from it . this beat sounds like  that one song its silly but cant remember it but its on a lot of commercials too
my first time watching the video and I was already addicted to the song; You know it's a bop when it's your 5th listen on release day.
Lo máximooooooo 🎉
OMG! tis is HIT! Awesome Miley!🤩
When pharrell sings it
Entregou o hit de 2024

TE AMOOOO
Is the dress Bob Mackie?
Miley gets skipped over for her talent. SHE'S AMAZING !!!😊
So great omg
This would be great on a loop in a dentist office.😬
So besides insulting every medical professional, Miley must think waving her arms around will obscure how utterly repulsive her tattoos are. What a clown...  ...a clown who is destroying her voice faster than Whitney (I would also assert she's destroying her credibility, but that never existed).
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like it. Going into playlist.
Giving me Maneskin vibes
2012 Vibes
Wooooow ❤❤❤❤ You’re as beautiful as a goddess.
oh my god you can hear pharrell and that dated way of making....oh alexandernevermind! if u NO then u NO!

that was INSANE. it should be ILLEGAL to be THAT TONED AND THAT HOT. She really grew up and I'm so proud of all her new work, this is incredible. Thank you Miley for growing up with us.
Hannah Montana is back,the style musical is very from hannah Montana
Such a bop and Iconic video, Queen Miley is back 😍

Jane Fonda's aerobics 2024
It's funny to hear Blurred Lines in my head if I listen this song
hired!
So prettyyyyy... loved!
Flawless
I loved Miley on the Grammy’s and I am sure she gained even more fans. Truly a superstar and omg her body WOW
I loveeeeeeeeeeeee this
boring
Perfection! Miley gets better and better. She is a truly talented star!!
I know some say it sounds retro, but I think the melodic structure is fairly new and it will take about a year before people fully appreciate it. I would consider myself an early adopter of music and it took me five repeats to understand how the music works underneath. I bet it will grow on others too and the song will keep on gaining audience throughout the year.
F-ing😄 Miley. she just has that vibe. Love it!🥳
Мне понравилась ее губная 😂
this is a somehow shittier one for one copy of Maneskin i wanna be ur slave😭😭do better pharrel
JUST THE BEST
😻😻😻😻
Something tells me that she's working with Pharrell for her next album.... I'm not an insider or anything I swear....👀🤭
Love you Miley Cyrus ❤❤❤❤
YESSSSSS 🔥😍
Ahora con ese merecido grammy q se ganó miley se nota mas alegre radiante trasmite mucha pasion sensualidad toda una triunfadora ❤🎉
Pharrell always uses the same tricks in his productions, so many of his songs just sound the same. Very lame, no soul. The guy's been an AI prompt before that was even a thing.
Love from Uzbekistan ❤❤❤❤
Let's be honest, this is a boring song.
❤❤❤❤❤
Love ❤❤❤❤
Yeh, this is another goosebumps music, You let our weekend to vibe, very nice.
Wow
new flowers❤
HIT
немного напоминает Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE
Great stuff!
Simply you're the best miley Cyrus you Music this Enchantingly

Gijón Asturias
Where is Hannah Montana 😢
I AM HERE FOR THE NEW MILEY ERA
FRESH
Yess I love the hair miss miley!!!!!!!!!!
Love this song by it sounds oddly like "i wanna be your slave by Maneskin" 😳 Didn't Pharrell Williams get in trouble over Blurred Lines in the past?   I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster 'Cause you could be the beauty and I could be the monster
Where is pharell though? Lol
Meneskin - i wanna be your slave vibes
Pharrell Williams !!! where?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
she just knows how to make hits!!
Horrible version of Beyoncé work it out produced by Pharrell
TINA TUNER FOR EVER❤
🎉❤
Sounds like MANESKIN 🤨
LOVE the hair ! Song is super catchy ❤
Im hearing blurred lines
Mid asf, not exited to hear this on the radio every day for the next 4 months
I can’t wait for the album !
“I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master. I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters” …kinda sounds like Maneskin’s song 😬
Super fun!
Hermosa!
Sigue asi y te agradesco de tu grammy🎉🎉🎉🎉
A NEW CLASSICCCC ♥
TE AMO REINA
I miss the get like me Miley. Tongue out.

Great singer and performer!  True talent! ❤🎉
She's turned into Tina Turner
Then is she here again to make a history
I’m getting I wanna put on some rollerskates and jam type of vibe!!! 💜🛼🎶
Teamo❤
You should thanks to your hairstylist to make this hair style and make you look great again.  Actually, you are already beautiful. It's sexy in yourself. There's no need to try to overdo it this much. Until look like drag queens over making act, making unsightly even though the songs are quite interesting.
The late 80’s are alive again! Bless you queen Miley! We love you!
Hermosa
Te amamos
Her body is literally perfect
Queeennn❤❤
I'm definitely addicted already 🥰🥰🥰
Amazing❤
Streams gogo

Miley Cyrus doing Beyoncé doing Tina Turner 🤣
🗣️🗣️YASSSSSSSS U BETTA WRK MOLLY👑😍😻🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOVE how it's just Miley. She doesn't need back up dancers or a massive back drop to make a music video!
This sounds different with headphones 😊
I love you
I love 💕 this song I'm addicted ❤
Chile loves u 🇨🇱❤️🥰
Some of those background vocals are almost certainly her 20 year old self.  Love it!!
La Gloria Trevi de USA 😅
Mother is Airbending 🌪️

Protect this legend!!!
This is giving me 2000s vibes!!!!
Wow just wow❤
Yay to more Bob Mackie shimmering on Miley.
i love you mileyyyyyyyyy
Sooo we’re channeling Tina turner today ok
70's 80's vibes. Dunno why, I was thinking of Michael Jackson from 70's and 80's listening to this and I miss so so much Michael Jackson The king of Pop🥺

-
Tina Turner copy 😂
So the hair at grammy's meant something

Incrível como é possível ver os dentes dela o clipe inteiro, no ultimo segundo ela faz um bico q esconde.
1:03 not the hannah montana movie hairlip ❤
Можно смотреть вечно на три вещи:Как течет вода,как горит огонь и как танцует Miley Cyrus!
Bet you Liam rolling in his future grave right now knowing he lost her. Id be fumed at the world

Miley and Dolly Parton
We love you, mother
Miley we also need “Nightmare” ☝🏻🤓
its giving Meghan Trainor vibes!
Ketchup on fries or on the side for this?
❤❤❤
ohhh myyyy god!!!!!!!!!
hi i like your new song milley like my comment show you agree❤
Reminiscent of Beyoncé’s All The Single Ladies video — the hair, fit, background, the three dancers (or three of herself). Not the same, but reminiscent.
still waiting for Pharrell lmao
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉super  wow😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
está en su prime
The first verse it so identical to that Eurovision band's song I can't recall their name
So this video is a riff on Single Ladies by Beyoncé, yes?
you know it’s Pharrell when it starts with that four count
In LatinAmerica we love Miley, we witnessed and experienced her talent.  She's unique.
Miley is UNMATCHED !!!
❤
🌷
QUEEEEEENNNNNNNN❤❤❤❤❤
Love it ❤
Where is Pharrell Williams?
So so so gooooood.  I live.
It looks like she had so much fun making this record and MV 🫶🏽 I absolutely love the song itself
I really hope miley decides to tour sometime. I know she said she’s not interested in it now.
Obvious that have to be something about composer, but Pharrell is not on the vídeo. Don´t understand the name in the credits there.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Já Viciadoooo
i just wanna dance to this song
Tiene algo de macy grey...
You are a big girl now Miley. 👍
Austin Butler sure do got some big hair.
the video kinda reminds me of the 7 things video, I don‘t know 😅
Bestie 💘💘💘 смайлер однажды, смайлер – навсегда  Но то, что в числе фанатов Майли случилось пополнение, это очень круто !!  Она еще и выглядит потрясно
MARAVILLOSA
Блин, я то думаю, музыка как то знакомо звучит и нашла: Robin Thicke - Blurred Lines ft. T.I., Pharrell Но, у Майли тоже классная песня, КВИН не иначе😍🔥  It's song so vibe, I like it! Miley good job!🥰🔥
It sounds like Blurred Lines...
It is incredible what big hair can do 😆
Mileys always been my favourite. Seeing her evolve both personally and musically has been amazing. She's the best she's ever been and is only going to get better
Amoooooooooo❤
Wow! Love it! ❤️
I love today's miley vibe❤❤❤❤❤
It says Pharrell Williams & Miley Cyrus, but this is only Miley, where's Pharrell?
Omg! She is perfect 🤩
Her body is on fire!
❤ Miley, work it girl!
Thank you, Miley, great performance But why don't you create songs that will remain memorable? I mean songs of a sad and romantic nature. This type of song increases your YouTube viewing profits many times what you can imagine, such as the song Broken Angel or On My Way.  a simple idea could make a big difference.
This is not a song by Maneskin?
Soo fresh
Duet with britney spears please
❤
Beleza temos sim viu ❤ 🇧🇷 ❤
Kool sounds 🤪✌️
She makes me so happy!! Love you 🤍
I do not think this is gonna work
terrible song, fabulos creators, but terrible song
Kool sounds 🤪✌️
Yasssss Nurse Miley ❤
Shes like i want to copy dua lipa now
te amoo, clipe lindo musica otima <3
Miley perfeita maravilhosa ❤ 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤
Porqueria 🤢🤢🤢🤢
I was waiting for pharrell tho😂
🔥🔥🔥
I am in love with every aspect that one could conceive of with this woman. Ugh. Obsession couldn’t even cover it. She has blessed me for my birthday month #onlygratefulfromhere
She looks like Jane Fonda’s daughter! Beautiful
so funny solo
a pop banger
Ann Margret & Tina Turner fusion! Miley is an icon ❤️
MY MILEY IS BACK (SHE NEVER GONE BUT SHE'S BACK AFTER THE SUMMER VACATION)
Wow
Is Tina Turner her inspiration for the looks?
jane fonda it's yOu?🤔!? LOl 🤭 Hehe!! 😂 Hahaha!!!  🤣 Hahahaha!!!!
I like the video, the song not so much.
She has everything and She knows ❤
She reminds me of a Young Madonna 😂 please stop taking off your clothes and stop being raunchy😂
I love her but the song isn't clicking with me. Good for her though for her new found liberation 🌠
I am obsessed!!!!
Catchy Miley my dear friend please be careful of any impersonators or anyone pretending to be you I've been dealing with impersonators since June 1st and I'm still dealing with them from this day so please be careful dear friend
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤ perfeita
Horrible!!
Uma mistura de Tina Tuner, com Kylie Minogue no clip da Beyoncé Singles Laydes amei. Ficou otimooooooo❤❤❤❤

Yes queen
Essa Miley tá muito boa! Espetacular! Amadureceu igual vinho!
this beat kinda remindes me on: I wanna be your slave by Maneskin and Blurred lines by Robin Thicke ft. P but i enjoy it ;)
I love it!!! Couldn’t stop bouncing! Miley is such a Vibe!!!!!!🧡🧡🧡🧡
Girl your arms are straight up incredible! Show me the way Miley lol
YUP!
She's beautiful and so very talented! I'm happy to see her shine with happiness and confidence. Another great song from Miley!!

Greatness? Why does she have to be so vile? My opinion only.
No no no no
love hearing those beats at the beginning signifying its Pharrell ha!
I LOVE YOU, I´VE MISSED YOU
так як ти сьогодні либишся, рівно через місяць будеш давитися сльозами
She is the best  Great vocal  Killing body 🙃 Pure talent
80's vibes. I love that we have new music from Dua Lipa, Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus.

LOVE that woman!
This looks like its gonna get 1B+ views in the future
Choreography by @trixiemattel😂❤
I'm waiting for Pharell Williams cameo ❤❤❤
I admire Miley’s confidence so much. To be raised infront of the world and still be able to be unapologetically yourself, is very impressive.
Amazing
Hermosa Miley, que Diosa, toda una superestrella ❤
awww loving the disco vibe!!!! i love her how she explore all then genre in music ❤❤❤❤❤❤

Dancing reminds me a bit of Tina Turner
Y Pharrell???
great, spectacular
❤it as am doing my exercise at the same time! Go Miley!
The vocals, 👌🏽 the visual, the dance moves, the simple sets and cinematography, Miley is truly the main character. I'm so glad she decided to release it years after from the vault. Such a good catchy song. Pharell and Miley did a great job.
It's so 2013
Cute.
I loved Miley on the Grammy’s and I am sure she gained even more fans. Truly a superstar and omg her body WOW 🤩
I want to dance to this !!! Amazing  You are living your best life ❤️☀️🌟 You are the Queen of your Throne no question! Blessings 💕
Maneskin vibes 😌

❤❤❤❤
Mía Coluchi
Is Tina Turner  estetic good ❤🇦🇷
Slay
Shes glowing 💫
Iconic artistes - Celine Dion , Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Taylor Swift. I don't think Miley is in this category. She is good , no doubt, but don't really think she carries the aura of what is coined an iconic symbol
You rock Miley❤
She took me back to 2014
Miss Miley You are a Star! I understand why wrecking ball had to happen. It catapulted you above them.  Awesome 💯
YESSS <3
wowwwww
Muito bom❤
Maneskin vibes
🔊🎶👏🎶👏🎶👏💯👍
This is Bad song. Its barely a song. And video is even worse :/ huge fan of Miley.
New Miley with this hair is giving everything!!!❤
YES MILEY, I WILL WORK IT OUT!!! 🤩🥰😘
flopped
Que gostosa de ouvir. Me lembrou muito Single Ladies da Beyonce o estilo.
She is so cute <3 I love the way her artistic persona evolved over the years!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤯🔥🔥🔥
Love it She is so talented and versatile. IS ANOTHER GRAMMY IN HER FUTURE ❤
She looking good as h*lllll
Oh Mama was promoting that look in the Grammys😂❤ I see it now! Go Queen👑
Love it ❤ keep evolving Miley, you're doing great ❤
Yesss❤ She just win her first Grammy
As always, her live versions are the ones I look forward to. This isn't doing it for me.
I love her
Meio que diva ❤
🔥🔥🔥

I’M OBSESSED WITH YOU
Love. xoxo
Looks way older than she is; needs to chill with the Ozempic.
You are too much witch
Anyone else see young Jane Fonda?
she’s the moment
🇻🇳❤️
Pharrell Williams??????¿??????¿?
I love this song. It's such a bop 🎉❤ and it sounds funky and catchy 😊 after some years and it's finally here!
I love  Miley Cyrus, is the best of the best.
💞💞💞
where is pharrell williams?😭
Mother Miley has arrived! With her Grammy!! ❤❤❤❤
just myself walking with this song in the background ugh! love it!❤️
i love how this is just a miley cyrus photoshoot😂🫶🏽
respect her name !!🔥🔥
Omg tiene mucha Referencia a la Era Bangerz y she is coming  ojala y asi saque todas las descartadas que se filtraron ❤
❤❤❤ A midnight medication 💊
obsessed!
Woooohooooo
Miley, did you leave the Grammys and go to a music video shoot?
she's in her tina turner era!!!
For those of you who don't know, this was once a demo during the recording of Bangerz in her early sessions with Pharrell.  Listening to it now, it sounds like a sequel to either 4x4 or Get It Right.  Miley and Pharrell make a great team, make great songs! 😊
Me encanta 💖
Divina
Look like she licked an outlet in 1987
Her vainers are to big for her gums
LINDAAA MAMAE
SLAY, QUEEEEEN!!!
Sound like “I Wanna Be Your Slave” by Maneskin
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ diosa
Slay queen
SUPER HOOOT!
Me suena a Maneskin. I wanna be your slave
I just love this woman ❤
she looks quite happy and healthy and RELAXED
Who is gonna tell her that we are going though a Genocide? Looks like another reality for me, i would be making masterpices about justice
x❤
Buy Shiba Inu coin 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
A piece of junk...
I remember when she hated on Mariah and now she has her style. Mariah's been like this her entire career, big messy hair plus short dresses
she's so powerful omg <3
❤❤❤
Ironically, sounds like a Robin Thicke song. That MTV Referee lap dance twerk from Miley Cyrus was the beginning and end of his mega fame and status. 😂
Definitely giving BANGERZ energy!!!  I love it and been needing it!!! 🥵
que hermosssaaaaaa! UNA DIOSAAAA!
pregaming hot girl summer to this song
entonces si saldrá en Grey's Anatomy o ne?
SOOOO BEAUTIFUL MILEYY!!!!😍😍🖤
THIS IS THE SOUND WE WANT !!!! THIS IS GONNA BE HER ERA ! BE READY CAUSE SHE IS COMING BETTER THAN EVER
Miley proving she's the singles queen
Hearing "work it out" reminds me of Beyonce - work it out
Like Maneskin
And Pharrell ?
Essa é com certeza a melhor fase da MILEY! 💙
What a dancing queen! <3
gorgeous and inspiring woman!
She is a goddes, queen!
La amo!! Eres la mejor Miley! ❤
The collab we didnt know we needed! Go Miley!!
love it
THIS IS THE BEST SONG IN THE WORLDD!IM UR BIGGEST FAN!!!🎉🎉❤❤
I think in the last 10 years she’s matured into a very well respected artist.  Her current “era” is a big step back imo.
Música perfeita! Ela está muito linda!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 love it sooooo much😍😍😍😍😍
🔥
Makes you want too go Roller Skating! ❤️
❤❤
Tina Turner vibes!!!
AWESOME SONG😍😍😍😍😍😍
ME encanta el homenaje que le hace a artistas como Tina Turner con este nuevo look que tiene.

She is everything
Tina Turner vibes ❤️

Diva is a female version of a hustla.she deserves it.She is a f@... DIVA.
That’s why I don’t mind having a raspy voice she sounds good and sexy The only difference is Miley Smoke cigarettes and I’ve never smoked a day in my life 🤎🫠
Essa mulher é TUDO. Te amo Miley
I like this Tina turner version of miley❤❤❤❤
Im obsessed with her looks but the song is pretty boring
Anyone else hearing Måneskin, I want to be your slave?
❤
👑
This sounds like Blurred Lines and that one Maneskin tune. Completely unoriginal.
nice song
These legs do not quit!!
Love you ❤
ME ENCANTO, ES ICONICA MI NIÑA
Her dance moves, omg❤
lo que yo la amo a esta mina no te lo puedo explicarrrr
YESS GIRL POWER 👑

miley cyrus 5th member of maneskin, gg wp
I love the energy of the music
come to Brazil pls
Her body😮. Good lord, her body. And that voice. Sheesh. And if that's not enough, her freakin face and big hair will get you. 😂. She ain't playing. ❤
It is totally clear how happy you are! You glow! You shine <3  Amazing song!
Miley x pharrell I could be your Dr🧑‍⚕️💃🏻🔥 (work it out)
O Pharrell n canta? 😢
It's like a toothpaste or shampoo advertisement. :)
🌹
Disco vibes❤
Slay girl 🥳💕💕💕💕
Clicked for the 4 count, stayed for the video
Smash
Bella la nuova canzone dei Maneskin..... Ah scusa mi sono sbagliato😂😂
I just luv her ❤ in the darkest moments Miley music saved me
wtf is going on 😨😨😨
I nominate this for a Grammy.
❤❤❤❤ só amei
I'm glad she's been getting more recognition lately, she's amazing!
not sure i get the tina turner, dolly parton hair
Miley we love you you
The hint she gave us at the grammyss!! Lovee!!
I want to like the hair but something about it feels off. other than that the song was fire and she rocked it!
El mejor regalo de cumpleaños 🎂❤😊
I love Miley in that hairstyle and her natural hair colour. She reminds me of old good times. 🤗
рады вновь тебя видеть, привет из россии, ты где пропадала ? ставлю лайк. 💗
i have a feeling she hasn't found her style yet. gorgeous looking, talented, but so often appeals as a copy/paste of something, that has already been seen before. what is her message, what is her uniqueness? Miley, i truly wish you all the best, hope we will experience many more beautiful songs from you.
not a mashup of blurred lines and I wanna be a slave AT ALL
This sounds like that song with Robin Thicke , " CUZ YOUR A GOOD GIRRRL "😂LOL HEY HEY HEY
yassssssssssss
Quite a nice song, but the beginning is almost 1:1 the same as Maneskin's  "I wanna be your slave"...
It's ok. After Flowers  being such a good song ...this one is a bit meh for me.... I like her confidence, and she always had a great voice.
La reina de todo
TOTALLY WACK.
Amazing soo good
CHE REGINA
ICONIC
Damm this song is really good ❤
This feels like summer.  LOVE!!
YESSSSS SO GOOD
🙌🏻✨
Giving Hanna Montana all grown up???😮😊
queen
Queen ❤❤❤❤
I'm getting old miley vibez.❤🎉
Mother of mothers
Sublime!!! Love this Christopher Walken danceeee!
She looks great and is at her peak but I think this song is terrible  I'm sure I'll get attacked for daring to be honest but this is so disappointing especially after  Endless Summer Vacation And I really hope she stops with the ridiculous hair. Once was fun... All the time is weird 😅
Miley Cyrus=Music Industry ❤❤❤❤
What a shit !
Beyoncé work out
Did Mr. William make the song because he's clearly not in the music video?
❤
temazooo
Her jawline is to die for
La mejor Miley.  Impresiónante.♥️😛😍
THIS IS MILEY CYRUS!
This is so fun 💗💗
I love Miley to death she is so beautiful and talented but this song sucks , like the video and the dancing though
I'm loving her new look!
Una vibra parecida maneskinn
…….and then disco came back
This sucks remind me of a gap commercial we need that old Pharrell back
I feel like this is the adult version of 7 Things.
La amo demasiado 🥹❤️✨
❤❤❤❤❤
Great job Miley, this is how you make a comeback, including winning a grammy!!!
Ahhhhhhh miley te amo ❤
Only one Miley ..just love her..her self confidence speaks volumes..keep doing you ....❤❤❤
2024 is miley's year haha
Miley was born to be a Bob Mackie's muse.
Miley is the perfect example of an artist who doesn’t need anyone else in the video to make it iconic
I love you Miley. Go
she is looking more like his mother, physically, love it 🤩
Miley Sempre Maravilhosa, Amei a Música❤
Yes mama🔥🔥🔥
You.. Must...... Return as Hannah Montanna! 😩😩😩
the 4 count at the beginning reminds me of 4x4
I have listened to this an unhealthy amount of times already. This may be her best song ever. LONG LIVE QUEEN MILEY!
Gloria Trevi?
🛐✨
MOTHER
I love this so much!!!❤
Always surprising us, muse of music 💅🏻🌼
I’m in love how Miley is being a constant DIVA with ALL the equipment of the 21st century!! ⚡️⚡️⚡️
Beautiful! And fun ❤❤❤
Letsgooooo❤❤
Is this the same look n dress from the Grammys?
Miley is so pretty 😍  ever since See You Again I always thought she was adorable.
Miley nunca desaponta ! 💛🗣️
a mega woman and song.
The song is a hit but where is Pharrell? Credit for lyrics because he's not in the video or singing isn't he?
HORRIBLE sorry
Love it! Miley you're a staaarrrrr! Is there a Tame Impala sample on the background around 0:53?
Me encanta
Very Tina Turner
Feat Anitta
#Goddess
Touch your Body
Suena a on my own lo cual tiene sentido por que también la compuso Pharrell Williams 😅❤❤❤ 💃🏽
This makes me so happy ❤❤❤❤

If this song not be leak before will be a bomp
I love this energy. Forever iconic ❤
I LIKE ❤❤❤
que buen regalo de cumpleaños
So it's a REDONE by PHARRELL WILLIAMS who is the SAME MALE FAKE AND PHONY PONY RIDER WANNABE ARTIST DESIGNER WHO STEALS FROM FASHION ARTIST DESIGNERS.  FOR SUCH AS  PARTICIPATION IN THE LOUIE VATTON FASHION SHOWS.
Cant help but think that lil feral kid from mad max....
Miley!!!! Wow!!! Congratulations 🎈🎉🍾
It feels like a throwback to Tina Turner songs. That’s the vibe I’m getting
Superb! Good Vibes from 🇧🇷✌️😉
Satan has no place in the future. None at all. All Satan will be is the devil that falls. God hears us all. Rear end of deadly sins have no plans in a world where Jesus is creating the super cans of a beautiful land.
ILLUMINATI
So pretty as always <3
Since her Grammy's prestation, Miley caught TINA TURNER 's vibe 😊😊😊
❤
A maior
I love it! Sexy hair and sexy legs! ❤❤❤
I think i see the problem
Miley!!!! I fucking love you!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Idk why but the arm swinging at the beginning is so satisfying to watch
Why I listened to Paloma Faint can't rely on you
Is bangerz gonna have a throwback?
She said she could buy herself flower, not that she could slay and snap like that 🥰🪩
what ya think?
I love you so much queen ♥
Dancing Queen...
maneskin - I wanna be your slave
This woman is just herself… she’s killing it
The Weekend feat. Madonna POPULAR.🔥🔥🔥
Que mulher aff❤ maravilhosa ❤❤❤
Mileyyyy 🔥🔥
Miley Cyrus and Maneskin playing this song together?? just saying..
Perfect❤
The outfits are on another level!!!🤩🤩😍😍🥰🥰🥰 I love you Miley!!!
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥💖💖💖
A rainha da porra toda ❤  Viciadoooooo ❤❤❤❤
李碩承大富大貴❤❤❤崛起
Miley still not singing Country but she DID get the Big Hair already🤣 Cute pop music but a waste of a great voice
que mulher linda, que voz impecável, ai mailinhaaaaaaa
I love how Happy she looks with this era, she defo haved fun doing this, and the song is really catching, this feels as if Can't be tamed was mixed with Bangerz and Endless Summer.  So ready for a new album with this vibes or whatever she is aming for with this.
🤦
queen!
🔥🔥
I love youuuu ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pharel always makes it worst
The best Miley Cyrus!❤
Miley my name is Sofia I'm from Spain and my friend Samuel and me we are fans number 1
Can't stop listening 😊 Come on with the Tina Turner young Jane Fonda reminiscent❤
Yaaaaaas 👑
How pretty she is with that hair 🎶
❤❤❤
Kellis really should I just stayed with her this is terrible 👎
What part was about Pharrell? 😂
maneskin i wanna be your slave ? .. meh ..
Yay for the 2000s comming back❤😂
Mama killing it 😍🤤
I love this new look. Whoever's styling her is killing it. So glam.
This has a 80s 90s pop vibe !! I just love this ! Kinda has the work work work song from Rihana vibe .
Yaaaaas Miley SLAYYYYYY
I’d rather watch your father’s old videos.  Ish sux
Gimme me some Tina Turner Vibes ! such a catchy songs !
The best Duo-Miley Cyrus and Beyonce ❤❤❤❤❤😊
Love her vibes
Put her on the news 🧛‍♂️
Her voice itches my brain the right way
I think the idea and the working on this project came after Miley's brilliant and historical participation at Grammys this year, it has exactly the same energy that she was showing at that night, the song and also the video. This is sooo good, we want you back in Brazil Miley 🙌🏻🖤
Y a qué hora sale Pharrell?? jaja
Miley: Bee, do you still use that room? Beyonce: Nooo, you can use it, gal  and then we got this videoclip
I’ve loved her since Hannah Montana and I always will ! ❤❤
Mother keeps getting more and more beautiful with time!
When her and Pharrell link up you know its going to be a hit!
real ones know this is from her bangerz era!!
Amoo
This dance is so mama Tina Turner vibes! Shine Miley!!!!
ehm, I pick flowers.
Ok where is Pharrell?
t’least she didn’t forget her underwear this time
🎵🎵
I love my Miley. Always have. I love this era of Miley. Fun and flirty but not to flirty. Like most see. I see a lot of joy and freedom. Especially at the Grammy's. I also hear a little bit of George Michael in the chorus.
why all pharrell songs sounds the same? meh. Blurred Lines 2.0  fkng bored
Me encanta! Para mi que tengo 55 diría que me lleva a la década de los 80 👏👏👏
The face✅ the body ✅ the hair ✅ the voice ✅ the moves ✅ the talent ✅  OBSESSED
It’s not just the music, it’s her good ENERGY ✨❤️
She actually looked so pretty with her buccal fat back during the bangerz era. 😢
Nice body n skin but too messy tattoo what a shame
Love this song ❤well I love all you music ❤
❤❤❤❤
omg another soty?
A complete Star.
best phase of her ❤
YES YES YES YES
I dont see she's anymore beautiful and turning like a drug addict and mental. She know that she's unreal as before anymore
So good 👍 🎉🎉🎉🎉
gente o que esse pharrel faz? onde aparece ele?
So Beautiful, Love your Hair stunning😍
Beginning sounds a lot like they sampled and slowed down Måneskin - I wanna be your slave
Amei!
she just have fun
Where’s Pharrell he not even in this
she’s the icon of our generation fr 😭❤
Horrible song . Sorry miley
its giving me teeth
Gotta get that music 🎵🎶 anyway. ❤
With a song *this good*? YEAH, LET ME WORK IT OUT ASAP!! 🔥🔥
Sing it girl!!!!🩷🩷🩷🩷
Bangerz (Mature Version) ❤
Oh Miley...you are such a  great entertainer but you are just not sexy.
Reminds me so much of Ann Margaret
❤❤❤
Miley Cyrus the missing Thunder Cat
🔥🔥
I can't wait to see the various live version. Miley would made different sound and I'm here for that!! ✨️💃🏻
Thank you , can music get back to FUN?!! Too much in your feelings is bringing the state of affairs way too low - RAISE THOSE VIBRATIONS !
Amo que se ve tan contenta y disfrutando, estoy viciadaaa con esta canción
Love her
the vibe is good 😊❤❤❤
What a serve ! ❤‍🔥
♥
LESSGO GIRL

I LOVE MILEY , SHES SO ADDICTIVE
Es un estallido de energía ❤🎉
The icon is here to stay!
Where is Pharrel? Watched this to see him. Looking at miley reminds me the photo at which she is pissing
Почему у нее все еще 1миллион просмотр?
Beyond this sexy and catchy song, I love the way Miley enjoy playing and performing this video... She looks funny and happy ❤
Yes. She is the moment
Oh my god are we getting an entire Bob Mackie era?!?! 😍😍😍

Queen!!!!!! 💕
She exudes that true happiness, mental health and self-confidence
Her and Beyonce should do a country song together
GARBAGE 🗑  TINA TURNER and AUSTIN POWERS dancing 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Miley 😍
1:49 Wizard in CoC be like
Heyyy! Love this, Miley is ferocious in this song 😊 ✨💕🦁
And just like that, Miley produces a crap dance number, with embarrassing overly sexualized faces and bum shaking. She has a great voice, but she’s such a pop star.
Miley is a gift to music! Such a positive vibe. So ICONIC! 👑  Thank you for this masterpiece, Miley! ✨️
I am as gay as a three dollar bill and I would let Miley work me out. TRUTH!
I can see it now, all the strippers and housewives in lingerie and stethoscopes doing lap dances to this song. It doesn't have a great sound but it's going to go on a lot of gym playlists.
♥
MÃE
Real definition of unique amazing singer/performer!
Where's Pharrell Williams ?
🤩Miley looks so happy! 🎵LOVE this Video! 💖
Yayyy Miley!Lets make a deal,if this song doesn’t get popular i will shave my hair,because I guarantee it will🫶
From Hannah Montana to Miley Cyrus ....my love for her  still same❣️
Получилось очень классно!👍👍👍👍👍 Было бы интересно посмотреть Miley с Miyavi, огонь гарантирован...
love miley, such a talented woman. her voice is amazing. too bad this song is not special. flowers, and river are much better
te amoooo mileyyyyyyy
NICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Notice the N.E.R.D vibe mouth closeups😂
Diva❤
amei demais mother, nunca decepiciona 😍😍
there is no doubt that Miley is feeling really well,i myself really like Pharrell Williams as a top notch musical artist,he was instrumental when he worked with Miley on the song"rooting for my baby"which is one of my favorite songs on her Bangerz album,all that being said,iam one of her biggest fans,and iam glad she finally won "Album of the year",in a award ceremony for endless summer vacation which is a unique album and probably my favorite album of hers....."handstand is actually my favorite song "...and one other thing,she has firsr dibs if she want's me
❤❤❤❤
Queen
Yes Miley
1M yes
This sounds so good! Guys also Liam Payne released Teardrops and I think that maybe single of the year!!!
Smilers a reproducir!! Demostremos todo nuestro apoyo a Miley.
It’s giving another grammy award song!!!!
YAS QUEEN! THE SERVE!
I'm glad this wasn't put on Bangerz it suits Miley's era rn more
Really dolly parton daughter
Damn, she's good!
Those big fake teeth🤢🤮🥴
what makes this video and song so CVNTY is that miley is literally just having fun. it's not intentionally over-sexual or "intentionally making controversy" its just a serve.
Perfeição ♥
Hanah❤
1 millon ❤🎉
Sounds like that mannskin song
Fun! I like that it's up-beat. Good workout song in more ways than one.
Ela é demais ❤  love you
Classic Pharrell song! Love Miley’s energy so infectious! Fantastic Tina turner Miley keep doing it!
I can feel the good energy radiating off the screen!!! I love a happy you!
Happy 1M!!!!
she looks GREAT 😍
Where is Pharrell ?
❤️
What is going on with her face?
She reminds me of this old Disney star Hannah Montalvo
❤
Adoro essa nova fase ❤
She looks so happy 🥹😍😍
So creative 😂😂😂
Love it!
Tina ?!
We need a tour 😢
OMG! I need urgent a doctor. I can’t breathe. Speechless 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️. God save the Queen
This is a girl who looks like she never misses a workout 🏋️‍♂️
Господии😍😍😍 какая ты крутая❤️‍🔥
This is amazing. Beautiful Queen as ever. We love u. And yes, you're indeed  an incredible
Nice song 🙂
Tina Tuner Vibes 100%
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHY SHE’S AN ICON 😩❤️‍🔥😌!!!!!
Perfect song
Adoro ❤
You can tell she was having so much fun with this video and it makes the song better 10’s across the boarddddd 😭🩷
She is just being herself and we love it
Miley can sing any genre. She makes it her own and usually her covers are better than the original. Beautiful and talented. She may have already been in the business over 20 years but she’s just getting started. Can’t wait to see what’s in store.
I’m not feeling the song or visuals. Idk
Let me work it out...Yay Miley...let me ..let me...
not my favorite song but i love her vocals in this song! 💞 her confidence shines and i'm so happy for her
*Wow! What a woman!*
Let’s put this song on number 1!
Amamos a la doctora del pop. ❤❤❤
💕💕
❤😍
I love this so much!!❤🔥🔥
it is so addictive. It reminds me of a Meghan Trainor song..so f#kn catchy!
Perfect 🎉🎉, Miley Now, justice for Victoria song 😭😌
Te amo Miley ❤
Me encanta!
This is giving me 2000s vibes!!!!
My favorite part is that its aaall HER. She said "I got me" 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼💓💓💓
can maneskin cover it , demnio voice will go perfectly with this song
And Pharrell????
The song is a shame because the visuals are great. The song …dosnt feel like a song. I can’t explain it. She won’t be winning a Grammy for this song that’s for sure. It’s as generic as possible. With a blurred lines sample.
Seguiré comentando todo lo que pueda ❤
Que clipe ❤
Come thru MOTHA 💃🌟😍
Eres perfecta
Wow just like hear from 80's and 90's music..Amazing
Perfection!
damn this genre is everything
QUEEN! 👑
Damn she looks SO GOOD
Miley looks and sounds great...where's Pharrell??
❤❤❤
Get in there Miley.
Muito bom ser fa dessa mulher
Dr Psiquiatra- Gloria Trevi

FOREVER MILEY CYRUS 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
QUEEN
😍😍😍
Not only is the song fun & infectious, it’s also showing in her energy & smile! Gorgeous! Looking forward to what she cooks up next! Miley & Pharrell make a fun team!
You can hear this is by Pharrell he doesn’t bring anything new to the table
Me encanta esta Miley 😍 ❤❤
Love u I will work it out! 🎉
Miley's legs😍❤❤❤ cute song🎵 🎶 🎵
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dope as always one of few singers who can sing anything....spot on again ❤️❤️❤️
IDC IDC she will always be in my top favorite ❤❤❤ she is just so dope 🤩!
I love u
Beautiful song ❤❤.
She has the  perfect legs
Remembered a song of Måneskin   Beautiful and talented Miley 👏🩵
miley never disappoints
Lemme work it out
as ferias finalmente acabaram ...
Pharrell Williams is in the music within the rhythm
If the words were different, to me it was a great beat, she danced good. Just the Words. The young kids are growing up to soon. This is there childhood.
Miley is at it again 😮😳❤️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️👌🏽👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
😭😭😭
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Reynaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 😍
😍❤️✨
I'm LOVING this new hair!
THE BEST
Me encanta lo Bangerz que suena xd
She looks exactly like her mother.
Incredible
Omg I love ❤️ this song I never bought a Miley cd until her last one last month she is so good and so cute
Dont approve of her tattoos and tawdry dress and behavior.  At some point surly she has made enough money and will someday not have to depend on the looks and body. Her voice and musical talents are amazing and demand respect because she can sing anything. Nothing but deep admiration for her gifted vocal abilities,and that is about it,until she decides to grow up some more.
Miley nunca decepciona! Sempre maravilhosa!!!
Queen
Loveee ❤💃
Какая же она охуенная 🔥
Mana bagian Pharrell Williams nya?
She seems so confident and I love her new hair style, she is the new pop queen.
The Bangerz energy is WILD ❤
🎉
Essa mulher é demais
I see the Britney homage baby well done 🥰
Song meh but looking & movin fly
0:18 en mi mente suena: i know you want it de blurred lines
All r here cmnting about her body, looks nd moves lol.. Noboday told how much boring the song is😢 one line again nd again nd the song end😂
👑🔥👏👏👏👏👏
Can you stop saying you love this new Miley? She has always been authentic, she was cured, you don't know what love can destroy a person, she was simply reborn, she always was and will be, a great star!
Miley deserves more than one grammy for her talent vocals and beauty
❤❤❤❤❤ Simplesmente perfeitaaaa
❤What a beautiful, multitalented superstar❤love her❤she is tge Queen of everything❤love from Finland❤❤❤
You are a BIG DIVA ❤❤❤
REINA
🔥
We love you and miss you Miley 🩷, keep on going 👍🏻👍🏻

Yesss Miley's Renaissance era❤🎉
Solo Miley Cyrus puede hacer que un video tan sencillo, proyecte buena vibra, felicidad y ganas de bailar. 🔥🩺❤
Never fail to surprise qweennnn🤌
facecard
Miley is f*ckin' stunning <3 i Love it
Love this!
I love her so much ❤❤ my favorite of all time
I think she's trying to bring back the 80's hairstyle
YESSSSSSS
We are so lucky to witness Miley’s greatness. One of the only legends left alive along Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Shakira
this hairstyle is like those in the 80s... it sucks! I wonder who suggested her to do it!
Miley as Queen Bey?... Ok
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Meghan trainor me too similarity
YALL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
Well she remembered her undies that day. Lol
Why do women think, that covering themselves in very poorly done ink, while flashing skin and talking about being sexually assaulted is attractive?
Queeen
É... eu te amo Miley o que importa é isso
❤WOW❤
Miley IS the moment! And this track is giving me OG Madonna vibes in all the good ways. Adding this to my workout playlist!
Her hair is ….
LA AME 😍😍😍😍😍😍
🤍🤍🤍
Miley tu és uma deusa entenda
Maravilhosa ❤
Maneskin, "I am wanna be ur slave" vibes. I love it.
Love it ❤❤❤❤ Such a catchy sound and Miley Cyrus simply glows positive energy, fresh beginning and powerful femininity 😊😊😊
The music reminds me of blurred lines
Shout out to the Miley’s dentist 🫶🏻🤭
Simplesmente amei ❤❤❤
In love ❤ Miley beautiful is talent
she's so selfcofident, she shows herself as a strong woman, like "that's ok, I think it's funny and I really can do it, common guys!" she inspired me
👎BORING!!!
Should I remix this masterpiece !
Bop
1:00 min in feels like RuPaul album cover (supermodel of the world).
That body...😍
PERIOD MILEY
E o country quando vem amada?
ESSA MILEY ARRASA MESMO
Phenomenal. Another new awesome era. Need an album like this!
love it
Miley never disappoints
Man! She’s very fit! 😎
Miley is stunning the outfits and the hair
❤❤❤❤❤
Internal screams of virtual excitement. 💙
Parece una calavera su cara 😮
All lives are precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: "For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16) God is just so because we broke his moral law by doing wrong against Him, ourselves and others, His punishment for sin is the death penalty. However He is also merciful which is why He gave Himself in human form (Jesus) to die for us, and take away our sins if we repent and believe in Him. If we do, our debt or bail is paid and we can go free. God is also merciful for those who have never heard the gospel and will judge them by their conscience, actions and belief in Him from evidence of creation.
The beginning resembles with  Maneskin "I wanna be your slave". It is just me? ❤Miley
Her Look 🫤
Que voz! Poderosa mujer, me encanta.
Love her collaboration with Pharrell❤

The song is nice but it’s way too basic
I'm disappointed, but its great to see her having fun.
Music videos usually hit around a billion views before I get round to seeing them. Got on this one with less than a million.. Finger on the pulse.
It was cute. Not a huge fan of the pharell sound
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A Dra miley cuidará disso!!!!
te amoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
MILEY TE AMO reina absoluta del POP
La amo, ES LA MEJOR... 😍😍😍😍
👑
ARGENTINA IS IN THE HOUSEEE
Aim love❤❤
Love d make up❤❤❤! I can be dancer to the tune💃too!
ARGENTINA EN LA CASA
TE AMO CONCHUDAAA
• most beautiful voice  • most beautiful face • most beautiful woman in this world 🥹❤️❤️❤️
Sweet Dreams Vibes 💃🏽
No dancers, no real set.  Chrisma.Talent. Star Quality. Nerve. Personality. Fashion. Performance.  She is entering Madonna territory!  Miley is becoming the artist she was born to be.  This video looks improvised and quite frankly "not enough"! It was hasty to rush into a new hit just because she won her first Grammy. Repeating the same hair, dress and performance is very predictable.  Why try to recreate the Grammy performance? Quality, artistic risk taking and longevity is more important!  By referencing Avedon and other fashion photography icons this could have been a simple yet artistic and (at least) fashionable video.  Also not mad about the black thong that she is flashing. Very basic.
You go GIRL!! ♥️🇨🇦
Loving This!!
I like this girl she has this crazy energy!❤
不怎麼動聽耶
Diva !
Pure energy
❤❤❤❤❤
ICONIC. Idek what else to say
O próximo tem que ser Nightmare please ❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
It really sounds like Maneskin’s “I Wanna Be Your Slave.”😮
Brilliant my girl felt like shes found has  herself 🥺🥺🥺
The workout in this video is my favorite part. She looks incredible!
Another number 1 here we come 🎉🎉🎉🎉
she's so fine i'm enchanted
REINA TOTAL 🤩🤩🤩🤩
i think they forgot to put phararell part in
That hairstyle is ridiculous. 😂
I like how this song came out when Beyoncé is out acting country 😅😂 Miley just slammed this song, a smashing hit 👏🏻❤️ #HomeRun 🙌
I'm so proud. Forever & always.
Ame❤❤
Where is Pharrell?
_"Violence is never the answer"_ but this is a hit
literally THE love of my life
❤
Maria Mercedes
Stronger word than MOTHER?!
2:31 sounds just like her bangerz era here. Ik this song is from that album btw lol
I love this song, I'm definitely going to be listening to this on repeat. Also, her asthenic is amazing in this!
I'm obsessed
I have loved Miley’s music as of late.  Flowers and Slide Away make me cry.  This is horrible.
I didn't expected this
I was really waiting to see and hear Pharrell...
Waouh ❤
Wow Miley
YES MILEY YEEEEEEES YES PLZ YES AND MORE OF THIS PLZZZZZZZ.
Miley's energy is wonderful. I am loving the sound and the vibe. I've seen every era of Miles and this is one of my favorites for sure
La verdad esta en la mejor etapa de su vida, al fin encontró un estiló que es para ella, que la hace brillar y ser la envidia de muchos, diosa y su voz esta muy mejor que antes. Diosa Miley Dios te bendiga
Deserves 100M
Some good music hallelujah 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I watched Miley grow up in her career.  She is enjoying her life with music. ❤
I love her vibes.She looks very confident and energetic 🎉🎉🎉
01/03/24 a fantasy song...Miley Cyrus a Bad or good girl???❤❤❤😂😂😂😊😊
The outward works of God's hurt will be the future of Jesus set free. Thank you kindly. 😇 society.
this is serving BANGERZ energy, SOUNDS SIMILAR TO Get It Right with Pharell all over it
Yeeesss
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Motherrrr

Deserves 10M already
❤❤❤❤
Miley only makes bangers! And there’s no stopping her
Estou achando a Miley tão espontânea com o trabalho dela, pra fazer música, pra fazer os clipes. Cria uma vibe tão boa que a gente só segue o fluxo.
Es perfecta 😍
A rockstar
Styling is definetly Tina Turner inspired!
Whoo! Miley keeps slaying the music scene w/ her iconic flare!
Maravilhaa ❤
misunderstood blurred lines production era incoming
True icon❤
Доступно в РФ?! 😱 Ну что за икона 🤩. Песня топ!
WOW!  This young woman is in her PRIME!  She appears happy and everything about her professionally is just on fire!  Not sure who her stylist team is but they are on point for what works for Miley.  Love this video.
Miiillleeeyyy!! I'm loving the dance moves and the song is hot!!! 🔥🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
amazing!!!
She wanna be Tina Turner so bad
Sorry folks... the video is totally wrong for the song.  Blurred lines format would have been great.
❤❤❤
If confidence was a person
Funk from pharell... Predictable and boring.
Sério, essa nova era da Miley está muito boa. É uma música melhor do que a outra. Eu que acompanho ela desde Hannah Montana fico muito feliz
the BANGERZ is back
True definition of confidence
It has the classic Pharrell 4 count beat in the beginning. Good dancey twangy groove. Miley giving the gays her Rockstar editorial era, love it.

I'd love it if Lady Gaga hopped on a remix of this!!
Smile of millions slkmsl
excellent, I love you, please  1 collabs with Shakira

I see so much more joy in her music process now and I’m here for it 🎉 I am honestly blown away by how beautiful she is!
This is so great!!!! Does anyone know if the "I feel like workin it out"  is from the original. That sounds like 2012 Miley voice? I never actually heard that version.

🔥 🔥 🔥
THIS IS THE SOUND WE WANT !!!! THIS IS GONNA BE HER ERA ! BE READY CAUSE SHE IS COMING BETTER THAN EVER
WAxxx Muzik up Thou

She's giving Shania Twain Vibe
This sounds so Meghan Trainor
Miley is low key my spirit animal!
Tina Turner's image legacy is still alive.
Miley I love you, I never thought you would re-record this song, much better than the one from 2012. I hope you can re-record other outtakes from the bangerz album❤
I bet Miss Dolly is happy the big hair is here to stay!!!
Секс. Но причёска ну не в тему вообще. ИМХО
✨✨THIS IS THE MILEY ERA🫶🏼✨✨🔥
It looks like she did this after the Emmys ❤
Bangerz vibes... love to see her so happy and free.

Miley nunca erra no hit .Ela sabe muito bem o que faz❤ amo de mais.
Absolutely living
Sounds too much like “blurred lines” . Pharrell overhyped beats are garbage
someday said that the dance at the beginning is basically Trixie Mattel lip syncing ☠️
Thank u for the anthem for us! I am a medical doctor 😅
This song vibes sounds like 90's songs ❤
Why does she remind me of Kylie Minogue in this song?
Muito boa
Siento que tengo que escucharla al menos unas 10#838201728201_73738$+$; veces más y ya
The whole video looks like a Vogue photoshoot 🤩 She's mesmerising 💫
She's just being Miley
Such a DIVA!! 😍

Divinaaaa! Que Diosa ❤ me encantas mujer !! Buen ritmo, buena música, bueno todo! Love u ❤
MILEY GURL?????????????WWW YOU STUNNING
this is one of the most painfully generic and repetitive songs I've ever heard. I like a lot of her music but this is just awful.
Miley Cyrus my QUEEN
These music videos are so stupid. Miley come on you can actually do music videos with a story. This song is just kind of bad.
Ох Майлі просто неймовірна, а пісня - капелюх чесно кажучи))
This is my favorite Miley era
❤
This screams MILEY! so herself. excellent stuff
Love it! She is fire 🔥
miley cyrus in grey's anatomy NOW
I love  miley❤❤❤
La gloria trevi gringa no existe.. la gloria trevi gringa:
DIVINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
😍😍😍😍
Um clipe “simples” porque só a beleza e a voz da diva bastam! Perfeita!
To amando essa nova fase da Miley ❤️
Terrible.
The shoes and hairstyle are the same from her grammy performance.
what a joke
She is the amazing
BANGERZ!
🥴
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Lets put this song to #1 on billboard hot 100 👍
No!
I love the happiness of this girl 😍
Eu amo a Miley, porém tô achando ela tão magra 😅
I LOVE Miley and her music, the song is great!! But I honestly don't understand why she doesn't get more into rock music. In plastic hears era everyone was telling her that her voice was MADE for ROCK. I know is not a commercial rhythm, but MILEY PLEASE
❤❤❤
🤩😍🥰🤩🤩 This duo always rocks!! She looks so amazing!!
A BANGER
🩺🩸💉♥️🚑
Nah, this cheesy.
White people think she invented twerking, now they will think she invented Tina Turner's style 😂😂😂
Love her music so much!! You are a SUPERSTAR Miley!!
All I see is her mom 😍 I love this song
SO BANGERZ
Miley always giving the best performance 😻😻😻😻
Obsessed w this sound!!!  Go Mileyyyyy! ❤ there she is 😊

Me encanta la energía de este tema.
She is looking so much like her Mama now i thought it was her mother In the video 😂 but Yassss Queen!!🎉 I am loving this video.💕💜🤗
❤🤍💯Ive played this so many times already this morning
People don't give her the credit she deserves.  She's got a great voice, very versatile, not afraid to do her thing & be herself, in spite of her critics.  I love her.

Good Artist miley
Vlasy má strašné ako v gnarnii lev
Peinado y look reciclado de los Grammys
Where the fuck  was Pharrell?!…I was expecting him to bust out with some happy type singing …something about working it out but no 😂😢
this is so much a pop music video.
tuvo los pies en el cielo, los tuvo en el infierno y ahora tiene los pies en el suelo, grandiosa
❤
this sounds like it was made specifically for tik tok.
Suena viejo 😢.
AMAZING
i love this so much
I am waiting for dancing with this in all hospitals...
Música chata 👎🏻
What I love about Miley's recent videos is that she looks like she's just having fun
Miley really said "I'm gonna get my money's worth for the Grammys hair stylist"
What a triple threat, happy, healthy, and HOT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
i remember this own my own from bangerz
Reina ❤
The best her body has ever looked
bruh
YEEEEASSS MAMA! QUEEN?! THIS IS YOU MOMENT!
This is my girl ❤

I love her. Love how she looks in here and love the moves, the video in general, but unfortunately I can't say I love the song. It's not bad, but I feel something is missing
Perfeita! ❤
She looks so confident, and like she’s having so much fun. THIS Miley is the BEST Miley!

She's happier and confident than ever. My role model forever.
YAAASSSS MY QUEEENNNN ✨❤️‍🔥
I feel like Miley is working her way through the eras. Last album was like 70s punk aesthetic, now she’s hitting the 80s hair bands meets Bob Mackey thing, feel like next album will be 90s grunge.
Que energia Miley ❤🎉
Вау 😄⚡👍👍 ты супер Красотка ❤👍🔥🔥🔥
There is no other Miley she is so much herself full of energy and so happy. So much fun to watch her🥰
Yaaas mama work It out

Майли с возрастом все больше становится похожа на маму ❤
a confiança da gata para carregar os próximos grammys✨
Так интересно наблюдать за этим смешением стилей
The song is so Pharell , I can hear that HAPPY tune but isn't catchy 👎👎
Sooo cute ❤❤❤
She is our doctor 😂❤
hino! VICIADAAAAAAAAAAA AQUUUII
Te amoooooo caraleoooooo ❤
Love her 💖💃🏼
❤♾️
Some Maneskin vibes at the beginning, right?
a besha tá belíssima ☀️
this is honestly SO GOOD
❤❤❤❤
Where is Pharell?
She is sending fun girl vibes and It’s contagious.
Pharrell Williams??? 👀
her veneers are way too big
Tina Turner looks beautiful❤
That body😍🥵
toda trabalhada na Tina
Queen❤
I don’t like it, it’s mid
Definitely getting Ann Margaret vibes. She's channeling her. Also a bit of Jane Fonda.
❤❤❤
Blurred lines all over again... Get a better beat Pharrell
It's like this music video takes me back to 2015/2016. It reminds me kind of fleur easts "sax" or Aris "focus on me"  I get so many nostalgic vibes
I hate this hair style on her… the hair looks like 50 year old woman from texas
Ela só tinha um vestido e um chroma key; e fez história :p te amo, Miley
She is glowing! I love her Tina Turner vibes.
She is so fucking beautiful!😍😍😍
OMGGGGGG 😻😻😻😻 so goodddddddsd
SHE IS MILEY CYRUS
King kohli ❤❤❤❤
goddess of beauty omg
She's true to herself and not to anyone else.
She has to be one of the most annoying women on the earth.
Reminds me Maneskin - I wanna be your slave
Fuckkkkking good
She's so good , she's her own backup dancers.
Ok just 3 out fit gonna work it out love it.
Figurino de milhões, amei a coreografia e a vibe doidinha ❤
Anytime 😁
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love it ❤❤❤
The most beautiful girl in the world 🌍❤️
Miley is back 😍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am so so proud of Miley. Proud to be a smiler from the start♥️✨
I see inspiration from Madonna and Beyonce. But your identity as MC is so powerful and being inspired by other superstars is such a great form to honor all pop icons. There's no copy, there's just light in you
❤ 👑 ❤
te amo miley siempre te ame te amoooo
Genial
<3
Dear my friends.  어디서 찌끄레기 영광을 자랑하느나. Miley cyrus jolene.  Noah cyrus make me.  Raye five star hotels.  Sigrid Burning bridges.  Sia unstoppable.  자우림 꿈.
she looks like troye shivan in a drag dressed
ela me faz lembrar um pouco da Anahi  nesse estilo
Crazy she's been in the industry for like 18 years at her age. She's been doing this longer than most of her contemporaries on the radio today. Most of them don't figure it out until their mid 30s or late 30s. Miley having total control of who she is and what she does shows! Felt like yesterday when I was watching Hannah Montana in middle school every night before bed and laughing my face off!
And taylor still keep making songs for 13 years old teen girls
She looks absolutely STUNNING OMG
yyyaaaaaasss
Agora fala com a voz aveludada: DOUTORA
I love this song!!!.... but I hope I don't feel another lawsuit coming...production is giving "Blurred Lines" 😮
Te amo, Miley. Siempre mereciste todo el amor y éxito que te está lloviendo ahora 🎉❤
Queen is back
Ela tá tão feliz
Miley's enery is utterly onvigorating...that shit on another level
Unpopular opinion: Miley should just start Disco🤸🤸🤸❤️
💃
QUEEN
ENTREGOU MAIS UM HIT
Queeen ❤
Tava esperando um frasco da Pantene aparecer a qualquer momento no meio desse comercial
She has some of the most boring music videos…
You don't need to slay that hard
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Sounds like 2013 Bluere Lines and Happy
WE LOVE YOU

You can be whoever you want Miley 😁❤ Very much of Tina Turner in you. Xoxoxo 🎉 Congrats! Pharrell's hand is notorious! 💙
It reminds me of Blurred Lines
SOS INCREIBLEEEE😍😍😍😍😍
Looks like Tina turner....
The song, the voice, the acting, the outfit and the hairdressing work ❤️❤️❤️❤️
💃🏼 mais livre e leve impossível ❤
Wow 😯
Ей больше нечего одеть😂
She try to imitate Tina Turner??
😊😊😊😊
Muy parecido a los videos de Gloria Trevi con Sergio Andrade como su productor.
Está increíblemente bella en esta última etapa.❤❤
Not Pharrell's finest work by a long shot. That's all I have to say.
We need the new lyrics ❤️❤️❤️ very good song 🎉🎉🎉 we need also to see you live performance
nice teeth.
An ARTIST🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾 she has come so far and I’m so proud of her
This is so 2010s pop vibes, and I love it!
It sounds like pharrell. Not great. But the video is hot.
Everything is okay but where is Pharrell Williams ?
Thank you Miley, I feel much gayer now
I love miley but not feeling this song...from the snippet alone i was like nah fam...hearing it entirety its not that bad but i was expecting a hardcore slayage but good for her though
On repeat 🔁
I love it ! but the question is about Pharrell? He is only producer, But why is as a feat ?
Why Pharell is on the first place of headline and nowhere in the video or song? He just produced it?
❤🫣💃💃💃💃
Roxxxy Andrews Looks amazing
Este estilo es tan fresco 😎 me encanta 🎉🎉🎉
I feel like a proud mom 😢🎉❤❤❤
This Tina Turner style dress looks so good on her. She's working it.
Will she now wear the same outfit/look over and over again?!? 😏😒
🤌🔥

imoecaveellll ♥
ICONIC
We are in Miley’s unabashed fun era and I’m here for it.

Энергетика бешеная! Ты огонь, Майли! 😊
I covered Doctor and would love if you checked it out, thx!

She is gorgeous
She looks like Silver Banshee. Ahhhhhhh😂 in a good way
Absolutely slayed it queen 👸 Miley! 💜💜💜💜🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I've know this song since it was leaked, but now you've made it incredibly more exciting! "Queen is what you can call me" - So true!!
I love this
This is a massive hit if I’ve ever heard one
Damn, she’s fine! But, I’m not the only one who waited for Pharrell to come out, right? 😂😂
Te amoooo
This song was made in 2012, Pharrell confirmed it in the new interview! And this song was leaked on YouTube a decade ago so stop comparing it. It's maneskin who stole this sound cause Miley has alike songs on Bangerz. This song was on YouTube before Maneskin even existed. This new version just has new vocals! Maneskin are the ones who were always stealing from Miley and were begging Miley for a collab in their each interview
❤oh yea baby!!!!❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Looks so good, this give me tina turner vibes
Nice 🫶🏽❤️
Love it so much!  ❤❤❤ Miley never disappoints!!! 🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😻😻😻❌⭕️😘
Work it out, Jane Fonda!
😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤
Queen
Hagamos tendencia el video
Maneskin copy paste
How long to we see this as a lip sync song on Drag Race do you think?
Sorry, but where is Pharrel
Reina
🤮🤮
Thats a crap song... 😂 She has made herself too thirsty.
Put this song in my head now!!! Love it! Amazing gorgeous 💚
this song better become number 1
This is my first time commenting to a video, let's see how much likes I get
ELA É TÃO BOA CARAS
Queen! Love to see her succeed

She's always reminded me as a man and sounds like one to.
Her body is goals 😱😍

So so grateful I was blessed to see her perform live!! I love you Miley. You have helped me through addiction, marital problems, challenges @ work 😂 so so grateful. I visualize you outperforming the legendary women who came before you: Tina Turner, Diana Ross,Cher,Madonna  etc. Keep evolving and make the world a better place just like your God mother! Dolly Parton is God!!
Miley doesn't need crazy sets to be absolutely captivating. What an amazing performance & video!!
i love you mileyy
This is incredible!❤‍🔥
❤🇩🇪😁
Идеальная))
She never had a bad song. I love her voice, her as a person, her energy so much. And she has so much fun in this video 😍
So who else hear Manneskin?
Looks like Beyonce plagiarism parody
Yesss Queen 👑✨
The beginning reminds me Martin Solveig feat. Dragonette - Boys & Girls
I love it..❤❤❤❤ Queen 👑
Omg i love u ❤❤❤❤

Maneskin's "i wanna be your slave" vibe 😅
Amazing ❤
Who else is here before the million of views!?
Miley ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
❤ Another awesome song! Is there any music genre you can’t smash?  Have been a fan of your music for a very long time and as far as I’m concerned your music speaks for itself, no matter the crap the tabloids like to post about your personal life! Admittedly I would love to see you hit up a full on country song….think you would wipe most other country artists off the charts!
where is Pharrell Williams?
I love Miley, but this song is terrible 😢
2nd grammy coming soon ! 🔥
She's in her best moment EVER
Причина тряски?
New loook new era
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Maneskin?Uguale l'inizio.
She's so happy and confident! Great to watch ❤🎉
Bop❤
It's really sad if an artist like her Publishing a song rejected 10 years ago...
I think I have never seen Miley that lightweight, authentic and happy ❤ She deserves it so much!
loved this since the lv men fw24 show <3
Ícone 🔥❤️
Interesting. Miley is  just beautiful. It troubled me  though why does it sounds so familiar... that part "i wanna be a doctor" sounds like Maneskins "i wanna be your slave"
🎉🎉🎉❤классссссс🎉
This is gooooood & she looks like a goddess 👌🏻new era feels 🔥
A BANGEEERRR
Tina Turner vibes 😍
Absolutely wonderful talent 🎉

La canción Tiene buen ritmo, Pero el video nada que ver, Extremadamente sencillo, poca creatividad y muy aburrido
лайк хане мантане!

@mileycyrus ignoring génocide now classe privilège 🍉✌
I love that is does not sound like anything on the radio right now

I this point I feel like Miley is living her BEST LIFE!! And I LOVE seeing that on her 😍
Dr. Miley Cyrus, MD and nurse Miley heal the world.

OMG, so haaaaard to watch Miley being hot for three minutes D:
I thought Pharrel was gonna sing too, beautiful song

Dont they listen to the song before agreeing to record it? Im sure she is capable to tell that this is not a hit song by any means. I guess it will get streamed cause of her fans , but lets be real, this song sucks (((

Miley never fails to read the room. Too many heartbroken folks out there not realising they can just spoil themselves instead of waiting for somebody else to do it
My favourite 2024 song ❤
I've watched Miley Cyrus since I was young. I'm glad she is still around and making BANGER music! 🔥
It reminds me Manesking  - I could be your slave

Girl ain’t go no rhythm… so now she is just trying to copy Tina turners exact moves
Guess
A doctor heals and God is a doctor for the emotionally and personally oppressed.

Tina Turner vibessss yesssss🎉
Shes truly come into her own, & is totally vibing in it. And its nice seeing her SO happy 🙏
“feel like it’s a very modern song full of vitality that you can listen to during sports, cooking and even with your lover or on your ex”
She looks more and more beautiful and amazing, it's incredible.  Shine with your own light, this song is beautiful
Ela saiu do Grammy e foi gravar o clipe❤
You're my lover
She's just perfect❤
Miley never fails to read the room. Too many heartbroken folks out there not realising they can just spoil themselves instead of waiting for somebody else to do it ❤
It’s okay…
This song was made in 2012, Pharrell confirmed it in the new interview  and this song was leaked a decade ago and it's still a BOP
❤❤❤ this is a hit 🎯💯
Iconic! A bit of a Jane Fonda/Tina Turner vibe. Utterly gorgeous
Does nobody cares about, that Pharell Williams does not sing in this Song?😮😮😮🤷‍♂️
SHEEEESH!!
Lemme worrk it out
Just love this girl! How much fun it has been to watch her grow into the magnificent women she has become over the years!!
Okay...... I think Miley is officially entering her best era. She truly found her artistry. Her music really matured
She is a real star ♥️ bling bling .. 70’s style suits her ♥️
But where is Pharrell Williams? Am I the only one who wonders?
Sex and the city / Carrie Bradshaw vibes Yaaaas guuuuurl
Bangerz mais do que vivo!
I love you, Miley!
Gloria Trevi, it is you??  ME da mucho las vibes de Gloria Trevi, Doctor Psiquiatra !!!
I LOVE IT GIRL

Queen ♥
❤❤
She's the big S ( Stunning ❤️😍😍)
La versatilidad de Miley es de admirar, de mis artistas favoritas que está muy infravalorada a pesar de su gran trayectoria, su talento, Miley es icónica ❤

Fabulous video!!
She skipped the Gym class that day
The first stupid song from Miley... And I don't think it is Miley's vide, more of Pharrell. This guy tries to become more popular with her help.

This video is sexy as hell. The song kind of sounds like Blurred Lines also featuring Pharrell. Is this gonna bypass the Marvin Gay estate?
She looks so much like her mom 😍😍🥹🥹🫶🏻🫶🏻
ICONIC!!!!! 12 years later they released this BANGER!!!!😍😍😍 and it’s even so much better now rerecorded!

So cute

Real SUPERSTAR!!!!!
SHE LOOKS GORGEOUS! 😍
Miley is just getting kuntier and kuntier ❤❤❤❤
She is a grown a** woman now 🎉
This is just as disappointing as the Grammy Performance, don't know why she's on that overexaggerating everything trip. I also don't think she looks that healthy, in my opinion
Omg. I am in love
It's the Grammy winner, Miley Cyrus! 😁
She's beautiful! And so the song!
Noooo . I am a fan of miley but nooo corny.
Una diiosaaaaa❤
QUEEN ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Blurred lines + come get it bae

Yeah. You work for it I don't deny. But you just can't do this if you aren't also born for it. (Admit it.)
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC VÍDEO, I LOVE U
DAAAYYYUUUM! 🔥🔥🔥
💙
Weird how she’s willingly working with Pharrell who helped raise 60 million $ to Israel. What a sellout, and the song is horrible lol
Too bad he's a Zionist
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL SUPERSTAR
Miley is the Now
Miiiley 💓
My fav video of yours im a bit stoned anyways i love you this is purrfection cun t i  love you

This is the best Miley I've ever seen. She looks like she has it all figured out! Confident, healthy, big hair!
🌻🎈
please use your voice and create something rock, 80s, unforgettable. This is a lil bit generic, boring, done before.  You have one of the best voices we have, useee ittt
where is Pharrell Williams?)
I love❤❤❤❤❤❤

a little bit meh, but shes stunning
The minimal video is honestly so refreshing to see  and I hate minimalism ! Just miley giving it honey ❤

miley cyrus never disappoints
Лучше чем блондинка, очень красивая, уверенная в себе. Превратилась в невероятную красотку!
Wo
Miley is just such a powerhouse of a performer, this is the boost I didn't know I needed
a hollow song...
Miley is just such a star
아 좋아
Kylie Minogue would be proud

Should we be expecting a new album? ❤
2:45 THE INTRO FROM HANNAH MONTANA
I don't like her new veneers. They have changed her face. Love her though.
❤
I am happy to see Miley shine brightest!
Lioness ❤🔥
💜❄️💜❄️💜❄️💜❄️💜❄️💜🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🥀🥀🥀🥀
Bayılırım❤❤
Why do some parts of this song sound exactly like a song  called“ I wanna be your slave” by Maneskin?
I love the rithm ❤
Queen. 👑
Omg ❤❤❤ there u r
Two huge talents get together - to make a really boring, monotonous, repetitive song! What happened???
Divina , I Love it.
Much love from Kazakstan🇰🇿 We love u Miley🫶

QUEEN!!! Been blasting it on Spotify!
Omg its fire

ICONICAAAAAAAAAA
❤❤❤
Luuuuuv u 💖
PLEASE....PLEASE....SERIOUSLY....I'm extra in love with the "Miley Cyrus fluffy"...that soft coat gives spectacular energy to the video.  ThIS song made me Friday... I just sing  "I could be your doctor" And I could be your nurse I think I see the problem It's only gon' get worse"  "Let me work it out," "Let me work it out,"  I LOOOOOVE IT!!!!!
oh miley the energy 👏👏👏
She looks amazing and so free… she exudes super stardom… the song is not good… but she’s amazing
It was giving something but built to nothing...IDK...I am not really sure I like it..but its ok
❤️❤️❤️❤️
💜. She reminds me of Tina Turner sorta, but thank God she will never end up in the same abusive relationship Tina Turner did. Bravo Miley. Glad to see her having so much fun doing what she loves. Ride the wave girl, you are invincible. God bless. 🎉🙏😇✨💫
❤
The best song ever!
it’s giving 🤔 upgraded beyoncé -ring on it🤩🤩
I've got some Madonna vibe🎶
So good!
Since my childhood, I admired Miley Cyrus's sexy body and femininity, and listened to her songs with pleasure.🔥😍😘
Simple and beautiful
Not vibing with the hair at all, but this woman's aura is phenomenally divine. She was one of the most interesting artists to watch grow and transform herself of our generation
Hahah a banger for the white people hahah it’s giving. Nothing
This is amazing doctor .🤩
The best ad of oral implants I've ever seen 🫦
You might think she has a cold😭 damn her voice cool😭
I dont like the video clip
No one like Miley
Boring song
Les't dance Baby⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
This Is The Era Of Miley!!! She Is Just Ultra Fabulous!!!
Ms.Cyrus i’m going to need to go on tour this year or 2025 please! just one more. an iconic eras tour❤️
Icon ❤
*Just Miley doing Miley AGAIN* 😍😍😍😍😍
fillyfaced donut

te amo
iconica
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Her beauty is insane
😂 these are getting too obvious 🤫😉😜 Luckily most don't work anything out
Esta es la mejor etapa de nuestra miley . Se ve tan perfecta 😍👑 amo todo 👏🏼
Adderall is a hell of a drug
I have watched Miley grow up along with myself, and she has always been an inspiration to me no matter what anyone says to me. At this moment in time I am totally inlove with Miley and feel so connected to her freedom! It's about time we all started taking a leaf out of Mileys book and be ourselves no matter what! ❤
half man half shark by king krule?
She is having so much fun! Love it❤❤❤❤
1:30 her most gorgeous style in the clip
It's like blurred lines 2.0.1 🔥🔥🔥Still fire tho
I love her!!!
❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵
I love her dance moves ❤❤❤❤
Totally Måneskin - I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE vibe!
She looks absolutley stunning, so gorgeous. So glad her carrier is peaking again.
I think Miley has figured out her biggest songs are ones where shes d only one in the video - flowers, wrecking ball. So maybe thats the thinking with this
La canción de le verano 2024 !!! this is the song for the  Summer, 2024❤❤❤
Ella en el videoclip me recordó a Tina Turner 😍
Let's make it trending guys ! 🎉
When she says “you wanna work it out?” I get so many Fly On The Wall vibes
First looks on video...I rembered Beyoncé - single lady....but Miley is coming better and better with her songs and video
Totally getting Ann-Margret in Viva La Vegas vibes between the coat, hair and dance moves. Great clip! Miley is creating banging tunes at the moment.
Que geniaaaaaa!!! Sin palabras, eres todo! Te amo diosley, reina por siempre ❤❤❤👑
L♡VE IT ❤
تعجبني والله
she must have filmed this right before the Grammys
Fabulous 💙💛❤️
She didn't wash her hair since the Grammy's
I wish i could like and like and like all over again 😂❤
Oh Miley the star you are 🤩
Kylie Minogue ?
I think she has similar vibe energy with Lady Gaga. They should make a duet song together. Maybe can remix song ft Gaga.
1:41 dooo it vibes
Mds ta MT lindooooooo
Love you Miley ❤❤❤❤
Miley in super bowl
Grammy winner
She looks so Happy
Miley queen
another bangerzzzzz!!! and counting.
Thrive Miley ❤ and slay 💅
Miley vuelve a llevar a toda la industria musical. ¡ELLA ES EL MOMENTO Y FUTURO! 🔮
Yes finally she's truly back after all these years...! After doing the song Flowers I think she found herself again! Her smile on this video reminds me the old Miley/Hannah when she was carefree and a sweet child. Except but now she's a grown up young woman with nice female hair and body that she's finally herself and not some role that someone else tell her to be.
One part is similar to Måneskin - I wanna be your slave and I immediately remember them. I love Miley❤ and I love Måneskin ❤ A kiss from Croatia 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷 Good luck Baby Lasagna at the Eurosong🏆🏆🏆
Cringe
❤
I LOVE HER HAIR!!!!
😘
Naaah. Random song. She can do much much better.
SLAY MOTHER ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
miley is the moment ❤

That shimmering outfit it's giving Hannah Montana season 3 WE LOVE TO SEE❤❤❤
miley is enjoying! I love you !!!
Miley never disappoints us🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️
She is beautiful but i don't like her hair style and her tatto in her body 🙏
The beat is like a song of Maneskin “I wanna be your slave”!
Wow😍😍😍
Thats Remember me on Beyonce Moment,a little bit from "Single Ladys" or?!🤔🤔😜
SHE'S THE BESSSSST ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mother is mothering
A production costing less than 1000 bucks will generate profits of more than 100 million dollars.
She's moment❤❤
She is living her best life

BANGERZ ARE BACK TO TOWN 💥❤️‍🔥💣
Is that a song ? All i hear is she talking words. She should fire this fycking idiot producer ? pharel wiliamson ?   This video sounds like,...... white noise & broken sound transmission, as if people talk through the wall, in a shower hobby singing.  HORRIBLE SENSELESS & EMPTY LYRICS  only the hair is classy  Someone should tell her that
❤️❤️MARAVILHOSA❤️❤️
Miley is on fire 🔥🔥😍😍
Her teeth are flawless lol
All I see is a new Miley!
I really love this new era, big hair, legs, high heels and dancing, go Mileyyyy
Espectacular ❤❤❤ hermosa y talentosa

Maneskin
Miley Will forever be a legend?
Pharrell Williams is a Zionist!!!
Omg iconic
😂😂😂 she can't sing or make any good music
This is giving me 90’s vibes and I’m ALL for it! Miley is on 🔥🔥🔥
I means she's cute.....I just don't like the tattoos ... 😥
No!! Miley has turned into JLo😮😂😂😂
This song is  garbage which is sad cause she is great singer
Who believe that awards of next year have a lot of problem  Miley arian cardi Taylor Beyonce. Taylor normani Nicki charlie xcx Chloe Megan the stallion Meghan Trainor
Where is Pharell Williams in all this?
The Miley Cyrus era has begun 🥰
Omggg
Where is Pharrell Williams  ?
She ate for me!!!🔥🔥🔥
Tina 2?
ICON
Miley never fails to amaze us 😍
😍😍😍
If this was released 11 years ago wouldn't be as iconic as it is today.
ES THALIA.... ES MARIA MERCEDES.
I'm 16 seconds in and can already listen the lawsuit from Manneskin, it sounds way too much like them
Anyone else getting 90’s Kylie Showgirl vibes? 💗💗💗
Superrrrr
Excelente 🎉
This is giving me Shania Twain pop/country vibes
❤❤❤❤❤ super ❤❤❤❤
la amoooooo
Maravilhosa ícone demais ❤
Wow amazing!! I see Tina Turner vibes!!
0:33 that little “ow” gags me so hard. SO FIERCE. It’s like a Britney song.
miley is multi-talented, love her voice, this woman is amazing 👍👍
This look is giving can't be tamed  but make it even more içonic
I soo need Miley to revive the scrapped album “She Is Miley Cyrus” cuz I’m curious about it 😁😁
Im not a fan but i like her i do. Recent songs and new artists its a nah for me but is this dope. Miley is workin it out.
Super proud of you Miley❤
MS. SUPERBOWL 2025 HAS ARRIVED .
Addicted
Another Grammy 🎉🎉🎉
She looks like Mariah Carey 😍
What is this 😢
Måniskin?!
She's everything
I love Miley. I feel like she looks a bit like Jane Fonda x w Pat Benatar
¡Abran paso a la reina! Amo a esta mujer
fabulous fabularse fantaastic....I don't follow anybody but was excited to see this and didn't disappoint,....get production, well done team Miley
Hi Smileys, help stream Mala Cosumbre by Chiara Oliver here. She just released her single today🧡
Unfortunately,  Miley looks like a very cheap version of Tina Turner. I do like Miley as a person, just wish she found her true self, her authenticity.
You rock. !!!!!
Resilient.🎖️
Her moves and style gives me Tina Turner vibes ❤
Iconic
I need more, please!! 😍🥵
Love you, Miley ) from Russia ❤ обидно что ты нас покинула (
They hated her twerk in 2013  and  now everyone loves her work
Where the hell is Pharrel ? 😮
She look like she about to ask me what’s love got to do with it.
Obrigada pelo presente de aniversário ❤❤❤
Proud you miley❤
looks like plagiarism of the maneskin song "wanna be your slave"
Ooooooo love this song 🎉💃🏻
She could fix an achy breaky heart
I think she went straight from the Grammys to film this all in the same night 😅
Whys she so obsessed with this hillbily texas outdated country hair?? 🤔
Reina 👑💖❤💙💜😍✨🙌🏻🙏🏻
Miley for super bowl 2025 💪🏻
I love her energy, her spirit of freedom and her hair 😂
Incroyable 🔥🔥🔥
Perfect Like always 😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
that 2:44 moment where she laughs and looks exactly the same as  the Hannah Montana intro
Where’s Pharrell at? 😂
Ended Taylor Swift
I'ts like Manesking song mixed with blurred lines
Clipe da carreira
Our next favourite flowers is here 🎉
Mais um hit Miley?
Música boa da porra
Linda
She needs to gain weight n look healthy. And fit. Not obese but she looks simply too thin. She acts like Beyonce Mariah but not an inch close.
Its very bad music
This is so Pharrell coded
She looks so happy...so 😍 beautiful
Milley esta animada. Nós estamos tbm❤
She’s the only thing in the video and yet is serving
She looks like Tina Turner.  Her lip syncing needs some work.
Whaaatt!! She ate! And ate all the crumbs too😍 damn iconic!
I feel refreshing in her music. Good vibe Miley🎉
🤘🖤🔥
QUENN❤
Icônica
Was waiting for Pharel to sing his line be like…
Kinda sound like BLURRED LINES to me
Where is pharell part?
THIS IS A GOOD POP SONG!!
🔥🔥🔥
Türküz slayyy 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Wow amazing ,
Maybe she’s taking Kylie Sonique Love as her drag mother seriously! This is the most drag I’ve ever looked- but it’s the right balance so she looks fantastic! I feel like the whole first look is a 90s Mugler/ Ru Paul reference
Gorgeous❤
356,973rd viewer…counting to millions easy ❤❤❤
I see u, and i click miley
Mileeeennnneeee
She’s so happy and confident, after Grammys ❤
Beautiful Amazing Joyful it's Miley Cyrus at her most happy time in her life. And with A Grammy or two Pharrell on this track. A number 1 incoming. By the way? Is it just me or does her look give Tina Turner vibe to you ?
“Let it go, be yourself, and live your life to the fullest."
damn deadly feat! pure luv it 😃🥰🥰🥰
remind me of this one maneskin song i cant remember the name of the song. awesome nonetheless
Adoro... ❤❤❤
This gives me flashbacks to 7 Things

Apparently, the Karen Filippelli + Phyllis on sales hair style is here to stay
God help me, I'm in love with Hannah Montana!!
Ugh!

Her every song will always be global hit same as with this too ❤
It gives me "I wanna be your slave" vibes by Maneskin... Is it me or does it sound similar?🤔
I’m already obsessed with this song 🥲🤣
Remember the song 1993 of Kat Graham Music
SLAY QUEEN

YASS QUEEN !
一段時間沒看到...變得好浪啊~ 但是我喜歡~
🤍🤍🤍🤍
How are you?  March 1, 1919.  Today is a very important day in Korea/Seoul, as it is the day of the independence hooray movement during Japanese colonization.  It was a non-violent, spontaneous, nationwide, young and old, male and female independence movement.  It's the start of a new month, March, right? Wishing you all the best for the rest of the week and the new month - good health and good things to come. And always supporting your beautiful/fascinating Activities. ^^
Miley should release her Bangerz Miley’s Version From The Vault with her unreleased songs like Doctor, Nightmare and Last Goodbye.
This song looks familiar with flowers 😅❤❤ But I like it 😊
Vivid reminder why I love you sm.
Esse cabelauam tá só o close ❤
This is the worst song I’ve heard since Britney’s one, feel like I’ve heard it before
Ameiii baby
🧡❤❤❤❤
I love her music and above all you can see how great she is, she doesn't need anything but her on stage, without decorations, nothing, just her and she fills everything.🥰🥰🥰 She is a real QUEEN on Stage.

Getting Tina Turner vibes.
She looks incredible 😭
Love her❤
This made me so happy
She's not me by Madonna????❤😏🤭🤔
The legend!😍🙏🩵🩵🩵
This is what happens to a woman when she buy herself flowers, write her name in the sand, talk to herself for hours and say things a man don’t understand 😘. Keep on dancing sweetheart, keep on dancing ❤️.
Ladies and gentlemen Miley Cyrus🥵
It’s giving 2013/2014 music, but in the best way possible

Sindel

She has so much charisma and authenticity that all she needs is a camera on her and she is in charge of the whole screen. A sheer force of nature.

I feel like 2000s music is going to make a comeback
Just WOW!
Am I the only one that started to sing "I'll remember when, I'll remember, I'll remember when I lost my mind" in the beginning? XD
Damn Miley! You are freak'n gorgeous ❤ Most alluring woman I've ever seen😊

She makes me wanna dance and have fun! LOVE Miley!
Amo a esta mujer ❤
Солидно выглядит в таком платье с причёской как у Тины Тёрнер, прям светская, нет шоу- львица. Мне она так больше нравиться аle ale   распущенная девица!!
The blow out hair🤌
Super! Tina Turner?😉
A chier
C'est quoi cette merde
She makes me feel uncomfortable when I see her!She looks and acts like your uncool drunk aunt and you make it your business not to look at them because you don't want them to come close.She seems and I feel like she will be erratic. Even her voice shouts that at me!!!
Diva ❤ ela arrasa muito ❤
Work it out 😇😇😇😇😇
Wow ❤
Could it be that this song doesn't have a real melody?
Meh. Sounds like it's a blurred lines sample. Basic Pharrell (sp? but also w/e) sound. 5/10.
I love you Song🫣🤩🥰
SUPER BOLW 2025
I feel like this song would hit back in 2010
As batidinhas iniciais do Pharrel
Sounds like 'Blurred Lines'
This is the rise again of Miley
if i can be celebrity ... i would be her no doubt.. always fresh, young, free, sexy, can't controlled, juat make music and show how its me in real no need fakee imagee... love you MS, from indonesiaa
She's evolving. Look at her ❤
👌❤❤❤
Great song and she is reminding me of Dannii Minogue here.
This the cheapest clip i ever seen
Amazing 👏  loving the hair ! We going back to 80s big hair !? Yaaaas! ❤ VOLUME UP!
OMG 🤩 it's the new hit 🎯
Best hair care commercial ever.
Wait she served
Where is Pharell ?
She looks like a fuckin supermodel!!!!
You rock it
Yessss queen serveeee <333
Queeeeen
She’s one of a kind and she’s my living animal. A living LEGEND! Love the energy that spreads positivity ❤❤❤
She is giving the Tina Turner Look & Style with a modern funky song. I love it. All here for it. Thank you Miley & Pharrell. Fantastic work 🎶👏💖
Not sure. I felt it looked lip synced. I’d like to see it performed live.
Blurred Lines 2 - Naff
She's  awesome ... songverycatchy
she going through her tina phase
How she look 23 and 53 at the same time?Always keep em guessing 😂
La reina volvió ❤❤❤❤
Me where's Pharrell Williams  Oh his over the beat.
A mixture of Wednesday dance  and Tina Turner. And a little bit of herself. Sad. It's awkward to see how Miley has changed.
Iconic
I  ❤ this song ...GO MILEY..💃🎵🎶
She looks just like Jane Fonda now.... Ladies, keep your bucal fat.You'll look older, and you won't be able to close your mouth😢 I like her personality though, but her music isn't for me. She looks happy these days. That's good😊
It’s simple but really dynamic. Loved the colors. She is radiant all through out and looks so good. Great job Miley, you are a superstar!
With her new style it's giving a cross between Sophia Loren and Tina Turner!
MILEYYYY 😍😍😍
The video screams zero budget! But just watch it become ICONIC!
I'm getting Tina turner vibes from the 8os hair to the dress
LET LITTLE MAMA WORK YOU OUT- SO GOOD 🥵
Her teeth are so big! 😮
Let me be your doctor 🏥💊
Lo divertida que estás, me encanta
She’s STUNNING!! An icon. I love how she doesn’t take herself too seriously, she goes out and she SLAYSSSS
why do I have Maneskin-Vibes?? This screams Maneskin :D
I’m getting maneskin vibe
Miely cada ano se supera a mulher está linda, maravilhosa que música gostosa de se ouvir e achei o clipe maravilhoso ❤
Holy sh!t....This IS Somfin.
THIS IS FLOWERS SUCCESS WORTHY
Miley Cyrus is such a queen, WOW at her star quality and presence
You are Miley Cyrus, you always work it out amazingly. Got to admit she is the best voice+looks in the pop industry
Cómo a crecido :')
Brunette Miley is back.
where is her orgasmic pleasure in the lyrics, it's all about bringing a guy to climax.
The choreography is Wednesday Adam’s a true pool of blood.
❤Chile, warm weather done hit, and Miley serving up this HOT jam! Instant invite to the BBQ gurl!
❤❤❤
Boss
THIS IS A BOP
❤❤❤❤
Rupaul dress on her looks amazing ❤❤❤
Finally! She deserve the best thing and full of sucsses
Such a star!!!
❤❤❤
Just iconic
Obsessed with this sound omggg
I love you crazy free careless 🎉
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
homage to Tina, looking down from heaven...
OH MILEY THE HITMAKER THAT YOU ARE ❤😍
This is unsurprisingly a banger! Can we stop pretending to be surprised that this woman is talented! Shes been star power since she was a baby
amazing
she IS the moment!!! 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
she is so joyful and every look is perfection
Iconic
Kinda felt like a veneers ad at some point… But great upbeat song!
Hey c’est complètement naze.
QUEEN 😍😍
Steeling from Maneskin I wanne be a slave - or the other way *round?
👏🏻
You finally find yourself serene and carefree...You are wonderful and spontaneous like never before!😉😊🫶👩‍🎤🧜‍♀️🎼🎵🎶🌋🌊🔥💎🥰😍😘🙇🙏🎈🌱👁️💓👁️
Loveeee Miley and this track, but the green screen colouring really needs the A&E 😭
How is it possible to be sooooooo pretty.....:)
What a pile of shit.  Particularly after Flowers
Is she still with her father ?
Miley is so beautiful
Brilliant!
Talentosa e carismática como Lady Gaga❤
🎉 Great success for us and for our grand success! 🎉
Where is Pharell ????
She's channeling Tina Turner ❤
❤
Nos regalaste una joyita ✨❤️ Te amo ❤❤❤❤
Great song and voice ❤❤❤
Beautiful! Fantastic.
The hair!!
Turn the sound off and she just looks stupid.  Sadly, Miley’s gone down the Brittney Spears path, except Brittney is a far better dancer.  How does nobody notice that they all end up in the same costume when they hit the “desperate for attention” stage?
💖💖💖💖
This song legit sounds like 'Blurred Lines' meets 'Flowers'.
🤟🫶🏻
Verla feliz y auténtica como ella misma. Hermosa, te mereces todo el éxito y la felicidad.
Where is Pharrell?
She is the most beautiful and coolest now. Thanks a lot for sharing, really great job! 👍🤩👏
Love the hair giving Rockstar disco ❤
Why does this sound like blurred lines 💀
My Lady, you did it again ❤
Is pharrell williams in the room with us right now
What did Pharrel do???
Omg she has incredible legs!!😍😍😍😍😍😭😭
La diosa a la que le rezo 🙏🏻
That was amazing great music video Miley Cyrus did it again
The song doesn’t match the stunning beauty of Miley in this video. So photogenic
This is the best Miley I've ever seen. She looks like she has it all figured out! Confident, healthy, big hair!
For everyone who says it is a copy of maneskin: doctor is from 2012. That song should’ve been on Bangerz but didn't make it. It was leaked in 2013. It was produced way ahead of Maneskin
Most talented woman on earth❤️
I NEED A DOCTOR NOW
OMG I love this era!
Miley rocks again ✨✨✨
This song is fireeeeee
Love the beat. Miley definitely had a glow up since Flowers💖
Good tune but all stars have the same veneers 😂 nobody has normal teeth anymore. An artificial kardashianised world…
Dear, you are at your best.🩵🩵🩵
We’re entering a new era!!!!!
Perfeitaaa 😍😍😍
SICK.EN.ING.
Ummmmmm I’m like pretty sure I’m 💯 percent here for this new era of Miley it’s giving me everything I didn’t realise I wanted ❤ and I’m going to add to my playlist right after this comment 😊
🗑️
magnificent  🤩🥰   if you just (( working it out ))  😇   with more focus in your next projects I believe you will be the next Madonna for the next decades
🤩 work it out
I have loved this song for a long time, so it is wonderful to hear this even better new version!

I like Miley but this song 🤮. And she really needs to learn how to dance. We can see that she has been working out a lot but she got to learn how to shake her fit body.
We love our Hanna montana ❤

Iconic
She’s giving me everthing and more!!!! I am here for the total package and the hair!
SUCH a difference between Flowers and that whole album and THIS. I love the contrast in styles. It's much more fun, and Miley looks fit as fuck ❤
She’s so crazy. i love her
She is a big inspiration 😍🔥 lov u Miley 😘
MILEY, BE MY DOCTOR PLEASE 😭
Here before this becomes a tiktok trending song :)
We can not let cardi take her shine 🔥

Me encanta esta versión de Miley 😊🌹Orgullosa de ver cada faceta músical. Extraordinaria en cada una. Exitos!
Miley Cyrus awesome song and music video.Miley love your motion and vox.Miley be safe and smart!!!Jerome❤❤❤
Lo primero que me vino a la mente, durante y al final fue: Robin thicke - blurred lines
She is so fiiineee😍🔥🔥🔥👏🏻
She ate!
1:35 Hannah-Montana vibe 😂❤
She ate this up
😍😍😍😍😍
Aparenta como 53 años con ese peinado jajajaj
Miley en super bowl
Hannah Montana loves Julie Anna ❤❤ ❤😊
I wonder if she filmed this the same day as the Grammys or just similar hair and outfits cuz wow
The Feel Like Workin It Out part feels like it has so much potential and could go somewhere interesting but then all we get is the Doctor part which is really just so lame and uninspired.
Beautiful
Iconic
I love this whole Amy Winehouse reference going on with her hair ❤
Hit 2025
sexy and seductive as always. you don't even need a background you're just fun to watch by yourself. pretty good song too. somebody mentioned SB '25. you wouldn't need no Alicia Keys or Ludacris or others; you can carry that show all by yourself
It s cool  and little bit fun ..but hear it before ..see it before ..I don t feel the wow …I love so Miley . .. she  can do better ❤
I love you Miley, orgullosa de ti
Man this is something to hear and see. I have a real genuine space of love and respect for Miley. She transends thru any musical mood. I changed my tune about her with Bangerz. But before that for the visuals she got me hooked with her twerked animal costume rendition of Wop in black and white BEFORE tic tok. Back to Bangerz which i listend to front to back and still love damn near all tracks on that album. Its actually really good and authentic with her interpertation of hip hop music and she even raps on it and it doesn't not even once sound forced or written for her.  Then her performing Wrecking Ball u saw was personal and emptional for her life right at that moment. Then i saw some concert footage of Bangerz and this chick opens with Love, Money,   Party on the hood of a low rider in a one piece bakini on her back and patting her.....u know what right there on stage. That was outragus in itself. More recently ive loved her rendition of Heart of Glass and her hair and Mugler jumpsut with the diamonds was amazing and also her rendition of Zombie was making me miss Deloris O'Roideran even more.Shes truly unique and sticks strong to her love of music.
So she's cosplaying Tina Turner now
BOB MACKIE!!!
This song sounds like “I wanna be your slave” by manëskin
QUEEN ICON 🔥 🐯
So hot!❤
I love Miley Cyrus now since she did Flowers 😍  Yass another hit she slayed 💅🎉
Loving it so much dear❤❤❤
I love that this unreleased gem is getting its moment years after it leaked. It deserved a spot on Bangerz but better late than never!
Finally something normal and something that can be considered cool, in... over a decade? Just get rid of the closeups on the mouth :)
Dude I’m healing from a brain surgery this is my song I’m going to learn to walk to this jam!
I'm not a fan of the Tina appropriation.
Like she is giving vibes from when she started music! The smile and the hair color and even some of the outfits! I am LOVING this version of her!! ❤
OMG she's never been more beautiful than at this very moment in her whole carreer. She's GORGEOUS !
This ain’t no Hannah no more, baby this is Ms Miley
she reminds me of fay Dunaway here ( sorry for the spelling) .. and its giving 90's vibe .. and i love it .. where is pharrel ?
❤️💖❤️💖❤️💖
this is really a good summer vacation song with the one you love, a weekend getaway song 😂😂😂❤
Poor song . dreadful video.
I love her movement!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤
ella siempre sacando molonas!!! buenisimaaa
I wanna play doctor with her.
im such a proud smiler 🥰
So proud to be a fan from the first minut She has inspired me a lot and I couldn’t be more proud of her ♥️
I love her❤ everything about her is special . Her style, her voice,her energy ❤ i was a child when i used to be obsessed with her Hana Montana phase and I'm still obsessed with her until now she's iconic ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why does this song gives me undiluted joy?
I don't know whats got in to miley but i love it ❤❤ she is fierce 😂
Never been this early on a music video, I'm very exited
Excelente
She looks so much happier and better ❤❤❤❤ Congratulations Miley 🎉 I love you since day 1

This video just screams narcissism "me mE Me ME!" Plus a throwaway decades old Pharrell beat, quote unquote "dance moves" a 3yr old tiktoker is not impressed by. Just no energy.
It’s like watching a meth head having a seizure.
I love this song
Mi reina 🥰💗

Thanks for calling us out - to work it out! 😂
You look like norma bates on bates motel

Her music is getting finer with time 🥰
I love Miley Cyrus!

Miley fans since Hannah Montana times👇
Miley Cyrus
OMG
grammy #3 incoming
Love from Macedonia.
Where's Pharrell?
Será que ela regravou? Eu lembro dessa faixa ser descartada de bangerz kkkk amoooo
she makes a good music
Let’s go
I love how happy she seems now! The joy in her face is contagiou!💞🌺
Hair conditioner ads should hire Miley
Oh she had so much FUN with this video! Another hit, @MileyCyrus ❤🎼❤🎼❤🎼❤🎼❤🎼❤
Yes Miley ❤
her vibes are immaculate 👌✨✨✨
ok why is the audio like 0.2 seconds behind (and then, ahead of,) the film ??  i know audio and film are recorded separately and then combined (standard practice)- however, the film could be capturing miley actually singing on set or it could be capturing miley pretending to sing/lip synching. to me, it is apparent she is just pretending/lip-synching and not singing in the video- is this an error in production?? can anyone shed some light on this   drives me crazy. miley is QUEEN nonetheless lol.
Can't wait for this year's spring workout with this song after dancing my ass off to flowers one year ago 🎉❤
Eu já conhecia essa kkkkkkk tem partes novas e não consigo imaginar como conseguiram sobreviver essa faixa
🎉❤
cannot get this out of my head, Miley is back and better than ever before. Bravo!!! Mic Drop Baby!😊
THIS woman has rockng body, and those LEGS!!! geez!
Beginning of the song sound like Maneskin I wanna be your slave and when she sing I can be your doctor sound so similar
I love this song
La más bonita
❤❤❤❤❤
Jost wow❤
we are such a proud of you turkish women. you’re turkish queen
Восхитительна и непосредственна)))
She looks like she's having fun out there, lol 🎉
Wearing Bob Mackie & dancing like Trixie Mattel. Win/Win 10/10
i love her new hair
The Bob Mackie dress on her is gorgeous
This is next level for Miley 🔥
❤ ESPECTACULAR 🎉
TINA TURNER mooving style  ?
Pharell where are u
Penyanyi indonesia harus tiru ini  Jangan buat lagu sedih melulu, apalagi jebolan indonesian idol harus tiru ini.
Невероятная красотка,я все больше и больше влюбляюсь в Вас🥰🥰🥰
She is iconic, but I don’t like the song
Blimey she's changed so much . Raw
Let's zumbaaa..go Miley
I love this version of a Miley mature, wild, free and happy with no fear of anything. Btw, only Pharell can make a featuring with no singing at all haha...loved it anyways
This is just wow
What a joy to see you triumph my queen
The very beginning  of the song has the same vibe as Månaskin - "I wanna be yourr slave".
she is one wild talented chick
Вылитая мать внешне
She’s ridiculously fit and So Pretty ❤
I need a doctor
Miley, te amo desde la primera vez que supe de ti, sos mi mayor inspiración, apoyo, compañía y confío en todo lo que he superado junto a tu música. Te amo y te agradezco cada segundo en el que escucho tu voz. Te amo, y espero volver a verte algún día, para cantar junto a ti todas las canciones que me han acompañado en estos 15 años junto a tu voz 💝
Is Pharrell in her hair?) Where are u  buddy?)
There really is no stopping her, she just keeps getting better and better 😍😍😍
🫶🫶
Go Miley!!!
Muy Chingonnn
Who is after Grammy performance flower to see what next she got

I know she doesn't like touring but she seems to be having so much fun lately. I hope she reconsiders.
Tiktok dance movessss

❤
Oh yesssss 💞 mother

Don't  need a degree to be  your doctor😉
the signature mouth close-up in her videos
Great great...number 1.
It's the botox and the face lift for me
Love it ❤️❤️❤️
I dont know... this song sounds like a  "I wanna be your be slave" of Maneskin in the chorus
love this queen, she gave me the confidence to be myself growing up ❤❤❤
i love her originality
I like the new Miley vibe. It has a Tina Turner flavor and it suits her. Rock on lady 💫
Qué joven se ve Thalía 🙄😆
👑👑👑
Like si esperabas que aparesca pharrell hahaha me encanto el tema de principio a fin 😍
How can I get a body like that?
Maneskin vibes
Beautiful goddess talented wow how amazing I love you

Not punchy enough and the production is a bit basic
This the Miley I’ve been waiting on
She will follow Taylor swift .God love America.
💘💓💋

Ngl...The worst beat by pharell
i love this style since Miley won Grammy 2024. And the music is incredible. She healed me!!!
Queen ❤
I got this feeling for a moment You (MC) brought back Jane Fonda vibe with added Your gorgeous and sparkling charisma 🌟 💫🎶💫
Спасибо, ютуб, что не заблокировал нас и мы можем любоваться этим клипом ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Miley is great but the song is bad and boring
Love you miley 😊
estás en tu prime chula
we love a fun song, such a bop
The Queen @mileycyrus❤❤❤
love you miley ❤
Pharrell 4 count in the beginning there ✔️ means this will be a big hit
JE T’AIME ❤️
Her hair is amazing.
Loveee song ❤❤
❤
Omg I love this whole new Miley ❤❤❤❤
I Love that the video and song gives me 80s vibes but in a modern way
Y Williams? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️😅
The funky bounce is the perfect accent for this 1960s Barbarella/Raquel Welch/Ann Margaret persona. 💓
I still couldn’t understand whose vibe Miley began to remind me of since her performance at the Grammys.. Kylie Minogue! I don't know if anyone will agree with this :) just an observation
Amamos a Miley 😍😍😍
Best video of 2024
Anytime people do close ups of peoples mouths I can’t fathom how anyone ever thought that was a good idea just make it stop
DIOSA REINA REGIA POTRA 🥵😍
The first look is so Tina Turner coded 😊
Miley Cyrus❤
Love it🌹love her🌹   Always stunning 🌹  Lets😢 work it out babe 🌹

She’s taking visual notes from Beyoncé . The clothes, the hair the wind.
You was always been my Beyoncé before she even became queen 🫶🏽 #hannahmontana #mileyisqueen #mileyforsuperbowl2025
Good job Amazing Miley and Pharrell clip 🎉🎉❤❤❤ boom boom shake
Yeeeeeaaasaaahhh! Pure joy, on!!! Brava!!! 💋
Whoever directed and shot this music video knows how to shoot a leading lady!! Miley looks incredible, she reminds me of Jane Fonda when Jane was in her exercising era.. The song is a bit too much like Kylie Minogue for my taste and where was Pharrell?
Wow, great job Miley Cyrus ❤❤❤❤❤❤  This song makes me want to dance,  but I am not able to dance at all right now because of the pain I am going throw everyday.  😢😢😢😢
Miley te amo!
The title says Miley AND PHARRELL.  Love Miley anyway.   Never saw Pharrell
Miley is quietly THE QUEEN 👸🏼
I’m 59 years old and I love this! She is nothing short of amazing!
She is so queen
Tnx miley
Respectfully, this song is going to be bigger than party in the USA and I’m here for this era of Miley. Love this song. ❤
Tish Cyrus is struttin' her stuff! 😉 (Miley looks SO much like her mom it's crazy.)

stunning
I feel like working it OUT!
Miley is a consummate professional and I love to see her development. She's doing great. She is authentic, with passion and heart. She is professional, chivalrous and honorable. Love it. I love every life turn she takes, her life journey very, very impressive. Love her work and she loves what she does. And everyone can feel that. She is to me what Marylin Monroe was in the 50s. It's amazing. She is already immortalized in history and she will continue to go her way and the traces in the book will reach even greater depth. I am deeply impressed by her discipline, her motivation and her constantly striving forward, and I take a lot from it as inspiration. Wonderful @miley You are walking your path in life. I love being part of it ❤
My first album was breakout I still have it. ily 💜

She’s been KILLIN it lately!😵

She’s great. The video is great. But the song and the melody is not doing anything for me. It sounds like one of those songs that plays during selling sunset. 😢
J'adore
this is my new personality for the rest of the month
Diosaaaaaaaaaa

Trump 2024!

I could be Miley’s cure… Big upps Pharrell, Bargy.
Every family has a person who breaks the chain of poverty. I pray you will be that person!

congrats miley on an another amazing hit
i am your top fan
Miley is the ONE they’re trying to convince us that other girl is
I expected Pharell to be on the song!
Her voice is so addictive!
Solo basto ella para llenar la pantalla. "El sol no necesita de nadie para brillar."

Best new song of the night
miley is so unique
i love her raspy voice
this is my first time being this early to something this good

i love her dancing around
miley is here to save pop music
Why is it reminiscent of blurred lines?
Tina Turner II
Ohhh the fluffy cloth dancing or shaking is really ASMR

Regresamos un poco a bangerz, y necesitaba mas de esa era actualmente
Is so happy song
She's so pretty.
孫翠鳳老師~~~ （尖叫）
that sparkly dress is so high-fashion
te amo maile
Te amo ❤
WTF is Pharrell? His name should have been in a title card, and left out the title altogether. Like that classmate that put 0 in the presentation, and wants the marks for the school project. Plus, Miley really needed a dance choreographer, and Pharrell could have given pointers. GFH.
SHE. ATE.
MILEYYYYYY 👑❤️❤️❤🥰🥹🎯💯
sadly i dont feel it with this song... good try anyway
Meu Deus eu AMEI
I love everything this girl is doing right now!!!
this song and video is on fireee

She can be my doctor, and she can be my nurse, but she'll never be the lady with the alligator purse!!! 😊

So what was first? This video or her look in the grammys? Maybe her look was a teaser for this video. or did she filmed this after the grammys? Anyway the song is a bop :D

The beat, the song, the low budget MV and Miley Cyrus vibes are just so perfect 😍
I love her so much. But that hair... 😭😅

This song is everything❤
If she comeback ! I think nobody will make another hit. She is so talented. I hope she keep doing it.
Lame
Lking this 2000's music video style❤
The song sucks and I see why it didnt make it to the album. Its sad and pity that she wanted to take the wind at her back but too lazy to record something new following her grammy trimphunt.
Loved it Miley...the song is fuckin' fire! 🔥
😁🤒😉
3 minutes of the same line 😒
This was so fun!
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
🥰🥰🥰
This sounds very catchy ❤ Miley looks beautiful 😍 it takes me back to 2013.
Is it just me or does this chorus sound exactly like “I wanna be your Slave” by Maneskin
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Little heavy on the mixing
All I can say is wow!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥 Damn girl! 🔥🔥🔥💯
Como la amo

Luv it! But… where’s Pharrell? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why do I keep waiting for Pharell to pop out on the screen in some gold shoes, giltzy jumpsuit and sequinned hat and shake his thing next to Miley 😂💕
Did they make her hair big because the song is so small and bad?
There’s nothing I love more than a truly Happy Miley 🥰 Shine Beautiful Soul ✨ SHINE ✨
me encantó todo
1:13 Esos labios ❤
you look so good and healthy and happy!
Yes Girl! 🥂
Can we all just take a second to appreciate the natural beauty that Miley is..nothing fake, just a real soul❤️
This music feels like 2014 or its just me?
YAAAAS Miley!!! Sending you love all the way from South Africa ❤🇿🇦
She is working me the fuck out
Is it just me or do I hear a bit of Blurred Lines in this beat?
Miley is a fucking queen
weathers getting nicer, this will be the perfect song for the warmer days ahead
MOTHER
SOOOOOOO GOOD
she brings back the real good when it was. the voice, the style, the taste, the feeling

HELL YEAH MILEYYYY. WORK IT OUTTTTTT
GODDESS OF LOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEEEE ❤
Si FLOWERS fue un éxito, exijo que este también lo sea... Miley tiene ese algo que te hace sentir sus canciones, sentir que eres grande, que el amor es genial, pero sin el también lo es, porque la soledad y el tiempo compartido son hermosos.  Te amamos, Miley.
Just divine!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

There are too much things about Doctor. First of all nostalgia, because every true smiler knows that this song is actually 10 years old.

I'm very sorry, I'm not interested in one night, I have to say YES to you, but refuse when God wants it. I sacrificed myself for this purpose, I sent away my friends and I feel sorry for their broken hearts...  Congratulations on such a wonderful song.
Amamos

MILEY SO PERFECT THIS, BITCHE
Tô embasbacado com tudo isso! Conheci esse descarte no segundo semestre do ano passado no telegram em um grupo e viciei tanto que baixei. Juro! Imaginei de forma bem utópica se um dia você lançasse oficialmente esse som e simplesmente você vem e lança isso meses depois como lead single da próxima era? Cara, se isso não é o universo em seu mais puro conceito de atratividade eu já nem sei mais o que é. Você em sua melhor fase colhendo o karma de ser você, de ter o talento que você tem. Que momento! Tô muito feliz mana!!! Te amo!
🗽🥰
❤️

Bored and generic
La evolución de Miley solo ha sido para mejorar.
Hey everybody my from Kyrgyzstan 🇰🇬 ❤ we love Miley
I can see and hear the 2013 Miley here 😭🥰
This is PHENOMENAL ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Girl, this is one of the best music videos I have seen in years.
She looks like a whole new personality each and every year. The "alter egos" she projects is so uncannily similar to my life too. There's something magnetic about her and her voice especially. Nobody's or ever will be like her ever again. Cherish her existence before it's too late. Mark my words. She's about to go down in history like every other legendary singers.
THIS IS SO VERY ICONIC OF MILEY !!!!
EXCELENT MUSIC VIDEO.
Queen is back
She's a real queen 👑❤
Dios mío Miley dando arteee
WOOOOOOOO HELLLL YES🔥

Pharrell serving some recycling of blurred lines... For miley... How original... Miley has had some real bangers lately, now every body is out of their minds because it's semi god Pharrell, but this song is below par for our queen.
This is how you feel when you just won your first grammy
🎉🎉🎉

HELLO FROM LATAM, MILEEEEY ❤🌎
Hemsworth didn’t deserve her. Slay bbg slay. ❤️‍🔥
THAT PHARRELL BOUNCE!!!!!!!!
Why is Pharrell Williams name on this song? He nowhere to be seen and there’s not even a “DJ Khalid” call card
Where’s Pharrell Williams? I didn’t see him in this video 🤔
She came along way breaking boundaries ever since her bangerz album some people judge her the way she acts and yet she didn't let it take over her. And she's still making waves she deserves it all. Truly an amazing artist
Miley is on top of the world! Well deserved 🤍
Lovin the hair ❤❤❤❤
This DOPE VOICE 🔥❤️‍🔥
Miley Is unbearably perfec 💙
❤❤❤retro

It’s simple. I say keep it simple. We’re so overloaded with imagery and samples etc. and videos and outfits that exceed what the music can ever do. Strip it back and come fresh.
Catchy song
I LOVE ITTTT, Love the way she doesn’t give a f$ck about other’s opinions, and how she shines in her own way ❤
te amo con todas mis fuerzas
just lovee her
That’s  giving me 2013 back ❤️❤️❤️ love it

Gosh she so beautiful 🤩  Loving this new music!! It’s wonderful- can’t wait for this new era of Miley
This dress and the dress she wore to perform at the Grammys UGH SO GOOD!!!
Seeing her have fun, made me enjoy the video that much more. In LOVE with this bop!!
For everyone, this is a re recorded song that she made with Pharrell back in 2013 for Bangerz but it didn’t make it to the record and the song was leaked after bangerz came out. So cool that she did this and re recorded it all this time later and this is WAY better than the original!!
THE IT GIRL.
I CANNOT WAIT TO PLAY THIS ON THE RADIO THIS WEEKEND !!" It's a delicious combo of Miley's Bangers Era   with an update of Pharrell Williams DNA all over it! FAN TAS TIC!!! ❤❤
The baseline tho 😱😱😱

Miley seems like she’s having so much fun in music lately. Also her fit is definitely an ode to Tina Turner
My treatment is about to arrive
I am actually really loving this. Miley and Pharrell worked before on “Come Get It Bae” from his GIRL album and it was one of my favorite songs from the album. I’m looking forward to this collab.
If my doctor ain’t her then I don’t want it
