The sick part is the tiny Liberal minority is still getting air time in media with their horrible crap. Supporting Israiel etc.
I think that prime ministers immunity (Latin: immunitas, criminal immunity), combined with high salary (2022: approximately 549 250 AUD/year; source: AI) can involve private trading in various stock companies. This makes it possible to let the public work up the profits without being aware of it. With a popular political demand for ownership in the companies, it is instead possible to significantly raise salaries and freely choose a profession. Furthermore, politicians’ salaries and any honorariums should be questioned, with reference to significant differences in pay structures in relation to regular fixed salaries. The political exploitation of the vital ecosystem has now led to natural disasters and force majeure, how will this affect people’s health and economy?
Get rid of liberalism!
How in the earth can Angus Taylor be in the running to be the next Liberal leader, his costings during the election were just non-existand on the projected cost of nuclear power, defense and the cost of living, all the things that the voters wanted to know were missing!
Which country did Labor borrow the $1.2 Trillion from? Is it China? Just to pay all the freebys offered by Labor?
as they use problem reaction solution use Dutton as the problem the reaction form the public and solution to win this won't work no more God said
Bus gone, Peter Dutton gone Jacinta price is next to go she's a member of Peter Dutton, like i say the Kama is coming for use from voice referendum , 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You folks never learn!!!
Another shameless election circus—burning public money on empty promises with zero results. Same recycled faces, same tired lies. Nothing changes but the slogan
Congratulations ❤
I'm not an Aussie, but is labour similar to the Trump administration?
The more I read, the more I ask is this the Australian or the Canadian election because I swear from up here the issues and results are identical 🇨🇦 🇦🇺😆
Ray Williams Johnson made it happen! 😂😂😂
Peter Dutton remember when you've didn't want Aboriginal flags to be raised up no more,,,😂😂😂😂😂
Kudos to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Australian Labor Party on the historic landslide victory. A heartfelt recognition for lifting up those who had fallen, and for showing respect and dignity even toward the defeated Liberal Party. A true demonstration of leadership with compassion and unity.
Running an American style election with Peter Dutton as the sole person on display was a mistake. Australians don't even know who the shadow ministers are. However, they do know the Labor ministers. The Liberal Party still do not understand that it needs more women in parliament. Woman perceive that the Labor Party has a fair representation of women in Government.
🌏☀️🇦🇺🌊🪐👨‍🚀🌈🌈🌈😂😂😂👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹
Bye dutton😂 Welcome once again Australia 🇦🇺  PM a Anthony albanese❤😊 Consecutively 2nd 🕰️ time in a row Congratulations 🥳 sir
Liberal all the way❤ now watch the prices of everything go up and health insurance sky rocket liberal helps people with big businesses Labor going to screw us
Jacinntta PPrice and her welcome to country destroyed Dutton and Liberal Party ..she literally hijacked Liberal Party campaign to the ground..stupid Libs..😂😂
Greens with 0 is lovely
So how much longer until China takes over Australia?
Congratulation my party win  Alhamdulilah
Well done Australia. You give me hope. Sorry for the Green party
The island keeps sinking faster and faster.
How does Mr Bean get another term?
Congratulations Labour, well deserved ❤❤❤❤
This country is doomed out voted by non Australians
They just doubled their property portfolios. Greedy...
Sad day for equality in Australia
Congratulations Labor❤❤
As a NZ Citizen who was planning to apply this June for the ADF. I change my decision, I'm not interested in getting involved in Ukraine which Albanese is so bent on sending resources and troops to.
Peter Dutton = Temu Trump
Omg you will all be surprised
🎉👏👏👏
Dutton had 3 years to come up with a solid plan and ways to fiscally support it--but he did nothing and sat on his hands. The LNP are a lazy ruckus and they all deserve to get thrown out and start fresh with a new generation. All of the careerists need to resign.. A country needs 2+ serious parties to battle it out with strong ideas and an agenda for the future, and NOT forcing us into the same 'voting for lesser of two evils' paradigm.
Blame trump??? What if he pulls the US out of ANZUS treaty.... ??  Australia and NZ can form its own treaty called ANAL
So long as housing is unaffordable for many Australians, then it’s all for nothing. Don’t hold your breath for new supply due to shortage of skilled labour, and don’t hold your breath for any serious reform on current tax breaks for investors and capital gains tax. Remember, politicians have on average 3 properties, so their priorities are where their investments are. Put them on the dole for a couple of years might help them
The one thing I was watching was the ONE NATION PARTY and they have definitely risen in votes - 817,000 people voted for Pauline Hanson and I'm sure in the next election it will only rise even more. They day of the independents is coming - and I'll call it now, come back to this comment and see at the next election, they will have their day! (I dont support ONP, I dont think Pauline Hanson provides any good solutions. Just all racist banter)
Segments of the Australian media blaming Honourable President Trump for election result. Unbelievable. How about thanking President Trump for lower fuel prices and inflation on the way down. LABOR ran a better campaign simple as that !!!
Utterly shameful winning the election based on the biggest pack of Lies and BS .And unbelievable that people bought the big Labor  Con .The Labor Parties character assassination of Peter Dutton truly disgusting, they are morally bankrupt.
Universal child care.  There is nothing a Government can give you unless they have stolen it from someone beforehand.

This is why Australians voted Labor 😂  Australia's Hidden Financial Crisis  Let’s break this down simply:  Government Debt: $2.08 trillion  Household Debt (home loans, credit cards, etc): $3.91 trillion  Private Credit (includes household + business loans): $6.19 trillion  TOTAL DEBT = Over $8.27 trillion AUD  Now... here’s what that actually means for YOU and every Aussie:  1. We’re living on borrowed money.  If you combine all government, household, and private debt, it’s more than three times bigger than the entire Australian economy (GDP). That’s like earning $100k a year but owing over $300k — and still spending like everything’s fine.  2. Each Aussie is carrying over $306,000 in total debt (on average).  This includes your share of government debt, plus household and business loans. If you're a couple with two kids — your household’s hidden debt load is over $1.2 million.  3. Households are now more in debt than the government.  That’s right. Everyday people — not politicians — are holding the heaviest financial burden. Massive mortgages, personal loans, Buy Now Pay Later schemes, and credit cards are fuelling our lifestyle — but at what cost?  4. Interest rates are squeezing the life out of this system.  When rates were low, this debt pile seemed manageable. But now? With rising rates, more people are:  Struggling to pay mortgages  Cutting back on essentials  Using credit to survive  And guess what? Debt with high interest is like quicksand — the more you struggle, the deeper you sink.  Why This Is a Problem:  Australia isn’t just spending beyond its means — we’re borrowing from the future to survive today.  If another global shock hits — a recession, housing market collapse, or even another natural disaster — this mountain of debt could come crashing down.  Banks tighten. Jobs go. House prices fall. People default. And the government already owes too much to bail everyone out.  This is not just economic talk — this is your life, your kids' future, your country’s stability.  The question we all need to ask is: How long can we keep pretending this is normal?
how much of the “win”was from CCP, union, AEC partiality, and Search foundation influence. nothing is legitimate about it. Communism does not belong in australia. there are no legitimate impartial institutions in this country.
Jacinta Price is rude.
Channel 9 coverage was lame. No experts on the 9 team
Now it’s time for second Labor government to give up nuclear submarine deals with UK and US, saving 30 Billions dollars for fulfil your promise of improving ordinary Australian people’s life, reducing daily living costs, improving Medicare services, infrastructure and many more…  it’s also a time for Australia to wake up about security issues with China: China will never invade Australia, even Australia “donate” 30 billions dollars to China for China to do so!  Because logically it is not China’s Fundamental Interests, and China has so many own issues to deal with.  China lease Darwin Port is to help Australia’s infrastructure, promote trade with Australia, in no way a security threat to Australia! In addition, why Australia richest woman in WA not to bid to lease Darwin Port before China?  I noticed before recent election, there’s a bipartisan agreement to take back China’s 99 year’s Darwin lease rights back to Australia.  It is totally for both major party’s campaigns strategy.  I, like many Chinese Australians, aware of that, but still vote Labor party, because we believe, second Labor government will have mandate to do something are truely important for Australia, not for US or UK! Making Australia a truthful independent nation in the world as our PM said in his victory speech last night.
We Aussies to want a racist representing our country! The people have spoken. Go Albo!
Australians must be doing really well under this Government. Enjoy!🎉
lovely another 4 years of pathetic yes vote woke politics wtf u doing australia
The biggest Yea Na to filthy trump  & his values trying to spew into Australia
Can you be more grateful 🙏 I think not .
Congratulations Australia 🇦🇺 😊😊😊😊😊
Yeah , right, good; now what are you going to do about the public healthcare and housing crises? And what about the Aussie “Achilles Heel”, the aborigines? They’re not going away, you know.
Thanks donald 🤣
Free Palestine
This was not a vote for Albo, it was a vote against a Trump clone and Trump policies.
Dont allow new immigrants to vote would be a completely different story !
Thanks Dump
Presidents and prime ministers are not elected they are selected to be the puppets to the crooks
Phew no Nu- killer!👌
Dutton you haven't the leader fabric! BRAVO WE LOVE YOU ANTONY ALBANESE BRAVO AUSTRALIA I"M PROUD OF YOU 💝💖❤🧡💛💚💜🤎🖤🤍💝
Promises and inflation with the Labor party . Nothing new. History repeats.😭😭😭
one leader is loveable. simple
It's going to be a tough 4 years Labour's uncontrollable spending not willing to cut immigration generational debt I don't think Australia can get out of this you get what you voted for.
Yes albo ❤❤
The reason Dutton lost the election is the religious and belief because Dutton is taking about the religion and Australiain people 90 percent don’t believe if not more
YAY that makes me happy 😃  I am a pensioner so this means alot for the pensioners who need all the help and support from our Politicians it’s a great day 🎉👏🏼👏🏼💯💯🤩
Just like Canada, the Australian voters have rejected hatred, fear mongering and trumpism. Good job!! -- Love from Canada
in one year time prices to live are going to be even worse. bunch of idiots
It was more of a vote against Dutton than a vote for labour but yeah
I think it's something to take as a positive with an added bonus the lifeline for greed ignorant stubborn conservative values took 41 seats step backwards in the last two elections, but without the Greens to advocate, put Labor on the spot with questions like how many homeless people and incomes below the poverty line is too many in a wealthy country that Australia fortunately is? Without this voice and pointing out the socially acceptable obvious standards, I think something around the 10% mark of nations population potentially face a permanent living hell or overly premature death caused by mal nutrition or fatal ongoing environmental exposure.
No nuclear poison in this beautiful country
Sucked in channel 9. All you do is back the libs it’s sickening . Thankfully people didn’t fall for your rubbish
Albos speech was motivating we are all one and need to unite as one community
Dutton lost his seat....sweet.
No wonder why nobody watches Nine
On the surface it might look like a battle between conservatism and progressivism, left and right. Underneath everything, I feel the driving motivation was frustration with powerful outside forces, particularly money and lobby groups, undermining our political system & shaping policy. The US result was also driven by this despite appearing to swing in the other direction. They saw the DNC's appeal to morality as a feel good coat of paint over intentions to essentially uphold the status quo. While Trump's appeal, despite his flaws (which actually humanised him), was the possibility of real change, even if it's a bit of a dice roll. I don't mean to say Trump was the right choice, but I think as Australians we tend to underestimate how desperate the situation is there. That voting Trump wasn't a moral choice the way we saw it, but a practical, even existential one.
Can the Liberals stop the spam ads every two minutes lying that the Labor Party has had a deficit for the past 10 years. Considering Labor has been in power for the past 3 years. It was the Liberals would created the deficit.
That’s it I’m going on the dole not working 12 hours a day for this crim
Peter Dutton forgot about Australian values. Wanted to become a mini trump and got trumped. Liberals should find an authentic leader and come up with policies that's good for Australia, better than Labour policies
Labor should thanks trump and his populist maga movement 😊
Australia will own you nothing and be happy. Under following the WEF. Good luck Labor fan.
Congratulations PM Albanese, a true friend of PNG
Good riddance Dutton
I wonder if the people who hate Albanese, almost hated Albanese too much in the end.
No seats for greens thank the lord
Mr Albanese heralded now best PM in over 2 decades!
The Voice .
Dutton and Jacinta vibing the con orange house
Another 3 years of out of control immigration.. I shudder to think what the streets will look like, Australia is already unrecognisable. It’s sad, we’ve already lost the country.
It’s going to be rough either way
Rigged bulletin.
Nine loves their Labor another 4 years of crap from 9 n Labor
Well done Comrades 💪🏾.
Australia is being Australia again,,,A country growing by ALP GOV!
What stupidity from the libs to think Aussies want to be anything like AMERICA 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ dumb dumb dumb 🤣🤣 but thank you for helping labour to win 🤣🤣🤣
Good work Labor. Not too far left, not too far right. We literally all cheered at the pub when the results were in.
Result shows: 1. Australians can't stand Trump and his cult   2. Murdoch media is irrelevant - their 3 years of vicious anti-Labor propaganda was ignored.
I VOTED IN A RURAL COMMUNITY LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON....THERE IS NO WAY THOSE VOTES COULD HAVE BEEN COUNTED BY SUNDAY MORNING....WHERE WERE THEY TRANSPORTED TO TO GET COUNTED....NO POSSIBLE....I SMELL A RAT
FANTASTIC RESULT FOR AUSTRALIA! 🥳👏👏
Dutton followed Trump that’s the problem
Hey, if Australia wants more labor, have at it. I’m retired and living off grid, none of this affects me. I’m just puzzled, because everyone has had nothing but complaints about living under Albo. I thought more minor parties would have scored a lot more. It all seems contradictory.
Wow and i thought Canadians loved pain 😂
Australia said no to Maga! 🎉🎉🎉
All the immigrants voted for Labour smh
SKY News is in denial
Great win by Mr Albanese,,,Australia now has got light for the Future,,,Mr Albanese is a politician for Australia, that's why he won, australians look up to Him for Australia
Do you have temporary government,answer no that is 100%fruod in election
We are doomed !!!
You are welcome. Us in Dickson made sure.
liberal warmongers, that is why they lost!
Investigate if you dare the involvement of the foreign powers in the manipulation of the media drum up leading up to the election and failed voting machines, where and why, if there are any computerised interferences and if there are issues involved in the counting process. Make it illegal to spread lies about candidates leading up to the election. representing
Dutton went from i may wake up being PM to Waking up finding a  job on Gumtree 😂😂😂😂😂
Its nice to win but im more happy that dutton lost.
this was expected to happen, the LNP failed to distance themselves adequately away from the political poison that is Trumpism, while also not having an effective platform of their own.  Dutton did have some momentum heading into this election, but quickly lost that momentum when he suggested some really stupid ideas that have been tested in the USA, by the time he tried to distance himself from Trumpism, it was far too late, the damage was irreparable at that point, and the results inevitable.  This was a referendum on Trumpism, and the Australian people said no in a loud and clear voice, hope the Americans can see what it is like to tell the baby in the White House no.
better result than liberal, the liberal government will never make up for covid, lockdowns and forced injections I would not be surprised if they never get elected ever again
Well done crikeys
The bigoted party suffers again another defeat.
🎉 🎉 Congratulations Prime Minister Albanese 🎉🎉 Allah (SWT) Bless you & your team in (Labour) Parliament 🎉🎉
What a sad day for Australia.
GOD HELP AUSTRALIA
Let's fix australia Mr Albanese from the damage done by LNP,,,it will take courage & many years
Thank goodness Dutton is not in Office
boofhead created a few records this election,but none to be proud of.
Labor voter over the years and can say Australia you are now stuffed!!! ... Surely it is obvious this Labor group right now is full of bought out in your face hypocritical socialists!!
Just remember you all voted for whats coming next i hope you have prepared your family
Australia is doomed, Lord have mercy 3 more years buckle up
People sure live thier liberal Marxist governments
the difference... negligible... bugger it
I hate both parties and ive lost faith in the human race for voting back in the government who created the housing crisis via massive uncontrolled immigration. Unbelievable
Now they'll push so much woke crap throughout parliament without anyone to challenge them Goodluck Australia
vote greens
who tf is stupid enough to vote labor they ruined everyones lives and anthony albonesi is bad at running a country
no votes for the greens? 0:29 I didn't vote for them, but zero? how accurate is this?
well done australia is stuffed enjoy the next 3 years you voted for it.
KICK OUT DUTTON PETER, FROM PARTY,
Dutton really thought kissing Israel ass will save him. This was a slap for his betrayal of Justice and international law. I am one one of hundreds and thousands that took a principled stance and refused to vote Labor or Liberal Both parties compromised and have ZERO interest to look after Australia & Australians Both parties have loyalty only to their corporate benefactors
Dutton's charisma is dead and beyond the possibility of a personality transplant from a suitable donor.
Let's see if bend over easy can redeem himself, after his last term he remains as the weakest Prime Minister, and it really showed when China was offshore doing drills, and as far as anyone is concerned he did fk all and nothing was changed.
Im really looking forward to my power prices going through the roof
Poor Australia you’re doomed!
LOL Australia is so screwed.
Unfortunately , what we are going to see ahead  for us Australians. Albo put the money 🥕 out and you all that voted for him fell for it. He has been in 4 years and what has he done  .  Things are much more dearer and difficult.
Australian voters are smart enough to kick away Peter Dutton also known as “Temu Trump”.
Just tell Albosleazy to pxxs off.
The country was heading down a dark path when they removed the 10 commandments from Parliament House. Which of the 10 commandments were offensive to the government??  Dutton was chosen so liberals would lose. They knew that labour would win  because the operation is so pathetic. Both liberal and labour are worshiping the same devil at the loge. Freemasons run this country under the banner of politics. Children are mutilated, murdered  and sacrificed under the banner of health care. Redeem the time for the days are evil.
now hold him accountable for his lies that he will tell, just remember you voted for tax hikes, hope you can afford them, and never complain about your power bill either
What an aspiration, 'universal childcare'- dear lord. Surely we can do much better than people outsourcing parenting to be debt slaves!! We are sleepwalking into communism.
Once again the 'expert' political commentators prove they knew as much about the outcome of the election as i did. Experts my arse.😂...proud of Oz rejecting Trump Lite in an avalanche!
Good by Australia as we know it we will end up the same as the UK
Liberals making one of dumbest decisions to push dutton and big business. What a pathetic campaign
We had a long period under Howard, where he dismantled industrial relations, capitalised as many social policies as possible, put all the power in the hands of big business that promptly shipped that power overseas   to their corporate head offices. Then a long period of leadership turmoil, short governments plus co-vid.  The last long Labor period gave us Medicare, Superannuation, so maybe lets see if Albo can deliver some wins for us when he's not at the mercy if lobbyists through media and hung parliments.
Dutton the DUD MILLIONARE!~ HOS!
I'm stunned, I don't understand how this soy boy could win so massively ?  People are hurting, people are suffering yet they still vote for him ??    x
Is what happens when you import milliions of votes.
Wild that Canada and Australia had elections within a week of each other, with similar results for similar reasons. Truly sibling nations.
Let's hope the LNP stick to their values so they can lose the next election.
Jacinta Price said “make Australia great again” two weeks ago and lost the entire election for the liberal party AND the national party.   No gods, nor kings, neither tyranny nor terror.  With joyful strains, let us sing advance Australia fair.
We needed more support for the Libertarian Party and One Nation. Come on people, vote the duopoly out next time!!!
got a real 2020 democrat smell about it
Mr Dutton, will be offered a job now in private capitalist business ;)),,,Fact is the LNP damage he did and he did it well ;))
Now we are screwed for more years of this idiot and Benny Wrong.
Dutton got what he deserved. That's what you get for trying to do a trump here in Australia 🦘🦘🦘🦘
China and Muslims will fight soon over who owns Australia. Stop censoring comments Ytube!!!
Dutton got what he deserved, we did not need Trump here in this Country. Congratulations Albanese
So does this mean that supermarkets will reduce their prices to what they were before labour came to office?  I don’t think so because labour is owned by conglomerates, in fact things will get more expensive.
Dutton doesn't understand Australia racist section are not the majority anymore
Modi ji tarah KAM karte hai
Soft
israels influenece is over, no more guilt trips no more gaslighting , democracy won , and you are done here
My look at the posts,   was this an Australian election??   Everyone is talking about Trump.. Peter Dutton is NO TRUMP!  Never Was and Never will be..   You all say,    We don't need America..   Well You got Your Wish. !    Lets see how that now playes out..   Oh! WW11.  Hitler did not die. Nor did a big part off his Nazi party.   They went to South America,   To start again..   NOT JOKING.   The truth s out..  THE WORLD IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK!    Australia is now at it's weakest..   The debit the Nation has?   Is far more than told..   Hey the election is over….  Watch and see !   If i were not already dying I would leave this country…. The people have become weak, fearful and lazy..   Government ?? Well   That words says it all!
Oh look, Federal Liberals getting the same treatment as the WA Liberals.  Unless the Liberals can truly clean house and properly go back to their core values and properly represent what Aussies want, they are doomed to die on the scrap heap of history. Australians do not want a Trump like party, we are not America, we dont want to end up like them.
Mr Dutton, Losing his Seat as MP, means End of His Political Career,,,OMG how GOD punishes
❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🎉🎉🎉
Labour stole the election but won the globalists selection, now watch the media propound come thick and fast
Here comes more controlling laws
At least the Greenz failed 😆
We are cooked
Greens are a bit too radical in their ideas and how they implement strategies, they are still too progressive to achieve traction with anyone other than woke older generation and young people. It is expected, but i hope they never give us as they will prevail soon in this decade!
Now that its ben proven that you can win an election while lying through your teeth (albeit with the assistance of the  mainstream media) I don't hold out much hope for the political future of Australia.
A total rejection of the Dutton/Trump agenda.
Aussies did'nt vote for you ! your payed migrants who now out number the real Australians did !!!!!!!!!!! This Election must of cost you a fortune, sorry us a fortune !!!
I think Dutton gave it up purposely as he knew Australia's economy is heading to a disaster. Only Albo is dumb enough to take this win😂
Sad we are going the European route. Australia was a good country. Not anymore
At least Dutton had a gracious concession speech proving we are not the US.
Yet another 3 years of lies, deceit- ....😞
What has happened
Mr Dutton, was wiped out as I Predicted, He bet Fascist IDEAS, he lost even His Seat That's a Disaster for Him
Rigged
Australia used to be referred to as the Lucky Country....is it NOW the Luckless Country with three more years of LIES Albanese,? LIES WONG? , LIES BOWEN?...and More LIES from the rest of the ASYLUM?. MORE HAND OUTS to Cover up LIES?, MORE WAGES and LESS PRODUCTIVITY?. BIGGER DEBT? that our GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN WILL INHERIT?, RUN DOWN OF DEFENCE with Made in China Mk 5 Catapults, being issued? will there be an INCREASE in CHINA'S involvement in interfering with AUSTRALIAN POLITICS?.      WILL the PORT of DARWIN be returned to AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP?.      Is Trump leading Albanese round by the NOSE?...IS Albanese fearful of TALKING TO Trump?
Um … is it just me or is the dunk tank the most obscene way to treat public servants.  I’m no fan of Dutton’s at all but this was pretty tawdry stuff.  Lowest common denominator TV.
TALK IS CHEAP!    LIES COST MONEY !    AND TIME WILL TELL WILL THOSE CHEERS END UP AS TEARS !     BACK IS THE VOICE. A DEVISION OF THE AUSTRALIAN VOTERS WISH..   AND THE MEANS TO AN END TO TOTALLY CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION….  COMMUNISUM HERE WE COME!    BUT UNDER WHO'S RULE???      ASK SPAIN WHAT RENEWABLE CAN DO..    AUSTRALIA HAS VOTED AND THAT IS THE MAJORITY..    HOW THIS NATION HAS BECOME WEAK AND FULL OF FEAR..   I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS BAD NEWS ….  BUT I WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE THE TOTAL OUTCOME..

BUT THEN THERE ARE TWO VERY REAL THREATS TO THIS NATION..  RELIGION AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH AUSTRALIA IS NOW NOT ONE….  THE WEALTH IN THE GROUND ?    WHY THE HELL IS UKRAINE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE?   IT'S ABOUT THE WEALTH IN THE GROUND…. THE E.U. WANTS CONTROL OF..   EVEN TRUMP HAS SPOKE OF A MINERALS DEAL???    MEANWHILE RUSSIA IS TO ALLOW IT'S TERRITORY TO BE TAKEN ???

WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME..   OR YOUR FUTURE NOT MINE !    I PREDICT THAT THE LABOR PARTY ?   SOME WILL BE KILLED AS THE TRUTH FULLS OUT..   GOVERNMENT WILL COME UNDER A HUGE PRESSURE AS THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER FROM SOURCE OUTSIDE THIS NATION  PRESS FOR CONTROL..   EVEN WAR!     OUR WEAKEST POINT IN HISTORY.  UNABLE TO DEFFEND ??    WHO WILL END UP RUNNING THIS NATION….  PEOPLE WITH MONEY WILL LEAVE.. BUT AT THIS POINT TO WHERE???      AS THE WORLD WILL FIND OUT CO2 IS A LIE..

Yes great work I did well done
Sky news lost their election.😅😅😅 You can fool people some of the time, but not all of the time.😂😂
Not one of the (at least) 100 random people I've spoken to over the last few weeks was voting Labour. In fact most were voting outside the 2 major parties. This election was rigged.... again.
2025  is the death sentence of the liberals   The Australian people have not just spoken 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺 they demanded the labour government to rule one of the reasons MEDI CARE  and good campaign management for all their seats especially Dickson Ali France campaign management annihilated Peter Dutton pathetic campaign      Ali France campaign management listen to the people  of Dickson  the people showed they heard Ali France and voted her in  she is going to make the people of Dickson PROUD 🇦🇺🇦🇺 she and her team have worked hard   And with that what a great Member of Parliament she will be  she is for the people
Sweet, more years of housing crisis, insane cost of living, getting bashed by first nation politics, and millillions of immigrants. Australia has no future
How is this a win?? The people lost before this election even started. Hope trump smacks more tariffs on this weak woke prime minister…
I have no other choices😅
Albo 1:38
Australia is now in a world of hurt.
God forgive them for they know not what they have done.
Strange landslide don’t know anyone that voted for Labour or any major parties - stinks of fiddling!!?!!?!
will make no difference because the same problems will still be there come 2028 but it's definitely good news for China and India
Liberal, Sky, more seats in parliament, and Murdoch got absolutely SMASHED! GOT SMASHED!
This did not happen.  I can't believe it.  It must have been rigged.
Ahhh great news on yu Albo now we will get the Voice more smoking ceremonies, more welcome to the country, more flags, more migrants, we will still be crying cost of living he will tax us more, no standby power resources we will have power cuts, our power bills will increase so will our grocery, meat, fish well done Albo voters we will really get ahead now
FFS not 3 more years of 'Albo'. What has Labor done in the last 3 years except f __  everything up? We can only hope that the Senate keeps up their job of canning the more obnoxious of Labor's policies.  Australia's 2-party system is total sh1te.
Well done Dai Le, we kept Labor out , thank goodness
Australia is screwed again !
Oh God even The Others got more votes than The Greens 😂😂😂
People must really enjoy the housing and cost of living crisis that's going to get a whole lot worse....
So what happens now with unrealised capital gains tax and will it be extended to your house, shares, investments?
Wait for the Voice to be done regardless of 60 % voted agaignst
Omg help!!! Hiding my wallet and buying gold!
Don't particularly like Albo,but i'll beef hooked voting for a mini Trump like Dutton.
Well..we're all well and truly done for now. Australia is finally lost,and all you voting sheeple are to blame. I bow my head in dismay. YOU DID NOT WAKE UP AUSTRALIA
Very dumb people voting for teals and he only has done this from getting teals abd greens
No One left behind unless you are a worker. Immigrants who dont work, dole bludgers, NDIS recipients and union stooges are the only ones that will be looked after
CH7 called it well before 9
Ah yes, nuclear power. What a stupid idea, designed purely to make rich people richer.
The circus continues  System broken regardless of uni political outcome  The Sheeple have spoken
Finally, Australia is waking up to Liberal corruption
So proud to be an Australian.
Oportunity far all? Murdoch will be horrified.
What a joke (:
Congratulations to the best party.
Time for media to start talking deficits, immigration and radical left fearmongering.
Best day of my life
Channel 9 and the mainstream in shock as their boss loses his seat!
Australia did not vote labour  they voted to keep peter Dutton out
Don’t worry too much guys the solution isn’t in the voting booths. It won’t matter in the long run! Get ready!
Well done Australia! Libs presented a policy debacle and the electorate responded accordingly.
Anthony Albanese couldn't lose Peter Dutton has the personality of a brick
Malcolm Turnbull was surprised when Dutton led the coup against him. He didn't believe that someone as mediocre as Dutton would see himself as fit for the role of Prime Minister. I agreed with Turnbull's assessment, and it has been proven now that he is correct.
OMG- AGAIN, This is a bloody joke surely! let’s us all tax payers work hard and he will spend all our taxes overseas. 😡 mate how about fixing our country first before others. Sir please give a chance to someone who actually cares, What a joke!!! ( this is my opinion I am entitled to it, if you do NOT like it please feel free to skip me!)
Today the comment section is allowed !!!!!!???
I did it for Penny Wong. Shim acted with a bit more “compassion” at the beginning of Gaza invasion and subsequent genocide. Unlike baldie who supported the aggressors whole heartedly. I thank shim for tidying up ABC and SBS.
I’ve got an old caravan if anyone wants their first home
Investigate the poll tally central computers in Canberra they have been hacked in favour of labour. The real winner is liberal. Wake up people!
Australia is now a sinking ship.. get off while you can.
lets welcome another 2 million immigrants  to feed the every growing house crisis
Kiss the country goodbye
Dutton really thought nuclear power and no work from home would make him win the election lmfao
Now remember, from now on, stop buying your morning coffee and pull your self up by the bootstraps and you will be just fine.  Oh, and no complaining from now on too 😊
So many racists in the comments
Wake me up before you go go...didn't really like the song ha ha. You live in the safest country on Earth, stop spruiking fear and , oh how horrible thing's are going to be. And P.S. Wean yourself off the Dalek Station i.e. Sky, it's no good for your blood pressure.
So does this mean most aussies are happy with how the last 4 years have been? Insane
Australia needs good opposition to keep government honest and accountable. Liberals have shown that Australia rejects sucking up to vested interest, billionaires and mega-corporations. We care about our fellow Australians, our environment and we do not want to become the US. Our society is not divided. We are different, multicultural and we celebrate it. We know what happens when politicians try to divide us and we reject it. Labor needs to sit down and create policies that will bring us together, strengthen our hand against corporations thst seek not to pay their share whilst exploiting our resources. Liberals need to do the same. We want you to do better. Be better. Racism, hate and Trumpism has no place in our great country.
Lucky Harmonious Prosperous Australia 🇦🇺  PM Albo. 💐🕊💞🌞🫶✨️
F..k, i voted for labor, i also should have put a bet on labor winning 😂
He is a gem ❤
We said NO to Dutton. NO to Trumpism. NO to conserving things as they are. YES to change. YES to made in Australia. YES to green energy and manufacturing. YES to our future.
Great now tear up AUKUS.  $330 billion need to spent on us instead of the US
1:30 this guy looks like William Afton
See where this gets us in 4 years. My bet. Nowhere
In these uncertain times where it seems to be a “dog eat dog” world, Australia voted for compassion and kindness to help each other get through this together. Good on you Australia, you showed your true colours yesterday and our remarkable country will be all the better for it!
Doing our best to speed run becoming the UK
When your news network is generally exstatic about the election results you know your in a echo chamber
I'm Liberal voter all my life but not this time , voted Labor .... Trumpski factor ‼️👍🇦🇺
I hope Susan leg takes over the leadership because she is useless.
Mr Albanese, please have enough  migrants we had enough
This is not a win for Australia. We needed better leadership from both parties. This is ‘I disliked the other bloke more’ result. Wow, this is what it’s come to. With a potential recession barrelling towards us, there are no good ideas from either side to dig us out of this self made hole. Nothing proactive with the government still faffing about with the housing crisis. 😳
OMG we have to put up with this weasel again. More inflation immigration and housing crisis. More corruption, losing our freedoms and free speech😢
Didn't vote for Labor!! Not happy with this result!!!
Thats good new s🎉
people voted
Mark my words. Those who voted for Elbow will live to regret it.
Labour taking Dickson and kicking Dutton off politics will never not be funny
Why primary vote so low.
I know very little about Australian politics. But I suspect that this will mean higher taxes, net-zero climate nonsense, and more grovelling to natives and migrants. Looks like it's getting ready to get more expensive in Australia and Canada.
No to USA.
A win for Papua !!!! more of taxpayers millions for ''Football'' [and whoever really gets the $$$$$$$ ] awesome thanks Mr Magoo
I just hope everyone re learns the lesson that pollsters are pretty useless and continue to let their influence wane.
Libs complaining about a dirty smear campaign should remember the lying, dirty tactics they employed over the Voice referendum. The whole thing was a bad faith campaign of racism that is echoed in the innumerable racist posts that are surfacing now.
like a very bad version of Mr.Bean
Albany Won the Ball, the redneck Aussie lost the ball.!
👏🇨🇦👏🇨🇦👏🇨🇦
We don't need Nuclear weapons and submarines. It's for the greatest interests of the US Arms industry, not for Australians
Well done Channel 9 for doing nothing to stop the worst PM and socialist government in Australia’s history back into government. 3 more years of socialist pain for Australia. How many Albanese lies did you let slide so that he could complete the plundering of our country.
No strong Liberal leader at the moment. I always voted Liberal,  yesterday I voted One Nation.
Thank you WEF for making this happen .
Thanks Australia another 4 yrs of woke leftie bs
88% rigged
LONG LIVE LABOR ❤
Well done Lobor❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
We say big no to US War games 😢
Liberals had three years to place strong candidates & they failed they need to find honest strong candidates going into the future we need a 3rd party that can blow the two major parties into oblivion  Not looking forward to what happens now can we be optimistic that the Labour Party will Honor their commitments  Australians pay attention to the next 3yrs
When Will Aborigin be Primer Minister ??
Dutton leaned too much anti immigration, too much to Israeli occupation and anti China 🇨🇳 🙄 which was unnecessary..
Ohh God help Australia. You guys used to be seen as total badasses.... Now look at you.
The LNP took the path to extremism and have paid the price for it. Those now vying for Leader of the Liberals are even more extreme, Hastie and Co, so will lose next time if Labor keeps its promises.
What corner are we turning together Anthony? 😢
Everyone who voted Labor I hope you get exacly what you voted for. More of the past 3 years. More electricity price increases, more inflation, more rent increases, more division, more uncontrolled migration. Enjoy!
Your lob sided support of Labor has now set the govt to reform the media
Congrats Australia! We also dodged a bullet here in Canada
Very good results 👍 congratulations 🎉
No matter who you vote for don't make a digital dunk tank for the opposition it's gross. Do better channel 9
Australia, what have you done?
I worked at the election in parra its funny because the half the libs were trying to strong arm everyone into voting them the most the libs were really good chill people we had a good time working together, it really looked like the libs were gonna win by the way no one was really taking our pamphlets and saying no to us and all that. The turn out was crazy honestly. GG everyone it was great. Poor Legalise Cannabis Party i was really rooting for them🥲
It seems Australians have voted for SOCIALISM. Coming soon, even worse housing affordability, Free Speech will be under attack and Energy prices will skyrocket. Just keep flooding the country with Immigration Labor to prop up your GDP. Pathetic.
For people for Australia congratulations Albo  and team🎉🎉🎉
an antisemite won. unbelievable!
Another Communist!
I think you use aspiration funny how can I aspire to own own house when you drive taxes up? You clearly have driven the energy prices up with this stupid renewables and not to mention if the government doesn’t rain in this parenting in this next term we will lose our national credit rating which will just everyone over so hopefully he has some moral fortitude and backbone and deals not with the greens and maybe accepts some accountability and responsibility for when he does make mistakeslike Peter Dutton did in his speech
How?
Man that silently racist majority stayed a bit too quiet this time, huh?
Didn’t vote for either major parties and was hopeful more independent parties would be in the senate. Looks like nothing will be changing for the lower income families trying to buy a house (like my family) And just more Indians to over popular our country. A very sad day for the middle class.
There are many problems in Australia just as there arenin many countries but people voted for the lesser of 2 evils unlike America
not into australian politics but who was in charge during covid?
All I see in brain damage
Sick of the mainstream media and anger-tainment networks trying to steer our opinions. This is evidence that we are an intelligent electorate, who reject culture wars and dogwhistling politicians. It's over for the extreme right wing, and its big message of irrelevance for its Murdoch mouthpiece.
Omg Australians have the memories of a goldfish. TDS got us all good. Well done media for deflection of things that actually mattered. You treated the Labour Party like a kitten to protect your own interests in fear of falling the way of the networks in the US. SHAME!
And it will be Labor for the next 6 years. Libs won’t recover from this before the next election
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇸🇴🇸🇴🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲🇭🇲
He only won by default, Cos liberals are so hopeless.  Now more higher cost of living .No happy.
36 is to much for the libs
Let's build Australia's Future everyone
This country is so brainwashed.  Labor is against Australians.
🇦🇺🇦🇺🇸🇴🇸🇴❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉 I love ❤️ 0:39 0:41
Congratulations to Australia for having such a fine leader, for Anthony Albanese was one of the few in the world who had the courage to be on the side of Truth & Justice, standing up to bigger powers in demanding the release of Julio Assange.
I voted Labor but I was undecided till the very last day. I was initially going to vote Dutton but when his party started following the steps of Trump, I said no on principle - seen children put in cages in the US affected me in a deep way, is extreme evil.  And that was probably the part which undid his campaign.
So... what just happened?My take…  It's difficult to explain just how big this was. For the first time since World War II, a first term Government in Australia just had a swing in its favour.  Independent candidates across the country not only held their seats but grew in popularity, and look to have grown in number.  Meanwhile, it was the Liberal Party's lowest primary vote in their history.  So what caused this earthquake?  Australians have never been above culture wars, we are not above the exploitation of division, and we only have to look back at the last referendum to know how easily we can be seduced by politics of fear.  But over the last 100 days, Trump's America provided a terrifying glimpse into where we were heading, like the ghost of our political future... the Australian people understood that Peter Dutton brought us one step closer to that future, and woke up in a cold sweat.  This is a watershed moment in Australian politics, it was an electoral win like nothing our generation has ever seen... and as much as I respect Albanese, this was not a win inspired by his leadership.   It was a wholesale rejection of populism... it was an absolute rejection of Trumpism, and Australia's future is better for this collective choice.  It demonstrates that all of News Corp's influence and all of Gina's money, couldn't turn Australia into USA's 51st state. We are a different culture, and this was the moment that proved it.  This was a repudiation of grievance as a political language. We must hope that what remains of the Coalition acknowledges this fact and reforms to offer Australians a viable centre right alternative, free from bitterness and vitriol. We will all be better off if this occurs.  Australia has made it clear, we don't need a "strong man". Our strength is our diversity, our empathy, and our humility. These characteristics must define our political discourse going forward.  As for Albanese, he has just led Labor to one of their greatest ever electoral victories, but his true legacy will be determined by how he leads the nation through the next three years.   Our housing crisis must still be confronted, our path to net zero still remains unclear, and the geopolitical environment has never been more unpredictable. He has the mandate to be brave and to act with confidence... I hope he uses it.  Australia hasn't suddenly voted its way into utopia, but it has averted an era of cruelty and callousness that I fear would have irreparably damaged our national character - but the challenges still remain.  Australia feels kinder today, it feels more humane, and more self-aware than I ever remember it being.  If we must thank Trump for anything, perhaps it will be this.
Symd
Albo didn't win... Dutto lost it..
Dutton the sub man ,  dive , dive , dive .
I can’t recall seeing such a bad campaign for liberals. They came out swinging against the public, anti work from home, cutting public service etc… it got punished hard and rightly so
This is Australia 🇦🇺.  We are one, but we are many. Dutton thought we are fascists and tried to be trump. Australia responded.
Chosing Sussan Ley as leader would be a death sentence for the liberals. She has a horrifying track record
Please please use your majority fairly and wisely and please explain your motives behind your decisions. Thats all I ask.
They are both bad, but if you think the economy is bad now wait until another full term of labor is done. Too many people thinking about themselves and their free handouts
God help us all i say ........ i can't wait for the price of electricity , petrol and food to come down ..... can you ?
1 million aspiring uber drivers already packing their suitcases for next year
Fools?
Look at that smug dictators face
We're doomed 🦘
Rigid .
Out of touch conservative liberals country has spoken
While I expect that aussie labour won't mind cooperation with Canadian liberal government as the  Canadian government charts a path of decoupling from ever increasing integration with the USA, also looking to make some deals with Europe as well, democracies need to stand together especially against that wannabe Trumpian dictatorship to our south!
Please do better.
Is a defeat for Australian main stream media which have been shamelessly bias.i am glad Australians no longer trust the narrative of those media. There is hope that we remain a sovereign country.
Wow, what a relief 🎉
The greens are gone from the house of reps .. great outcome.
Trouble with the Libs is that, as well as the usual dogmatic ideology and lack of compassion, they demonstrated incompetence as well. There seems to be a lack of talent in their ranks which has to be a concern. Signs are they need a major rethink and rebirth. Hint: to quit denying science would be a good start.
Jeez you people take liberty with language in corporate media. "the first opposition leader to lose his seat in an election". Who was the first Prime minister to lose his seat during an election??? As if this is a new thing for the Liberal party to lose a leaders seat in a safe electorate?
The day the Liberal’s elected Dutton as opposition leader they lost the election, the guy is very unlikeable
Karl Stefanovics power is now TOAST!!!!!! RETIRE!!!!
What a victory speech! Bringing hope back to humanity.
Nuclear power plants up and down the coast spewing radioactive outflows onto beaches clearly not a vote winner for some reason
Media is so outta touch...people are not happy people dont like any of them....knowine is partying except the tax payer funded cronies controlling your warped impression of reality. You dont represent the ppl your perpetuate an illusion for the masses
Albo will distryoy your country
Neither ef party are good friends Australia
I really think both parties are determined to take the wrong lessons from this election. The Liberals have lost the Turnbull branch of the party, and rather than recognizing this as a problem, they seem to be pivoting further to the right—ensuring those voters won't return in future election cycles. Labor appears to be overestimating their own role in the outcome as well. My family were traditional Liberal voters, but they lost us with the culture wars nonsense. Australia isn't America—Trump’s antics aren’t a positive here. If the Liberals can find a way to stop being nutjobs, we’ll likely go back.
Looks like Australia is running its elections just like Russia and Belarus and China
Labor this is the same party that’s made the percentage of homelessness up thru the roof the same party making it illegal to be homeless  Another 3 years a lot of aussies company will be gone   the construction industry is screwed  By the time ablos is finished a 3 bedroom home that was $450k will be 900k just to build Thanks to the woke and the lefts If you run a business and voted albo I really hope you have plenty of money Country will be mini India within 3 years and penny Wong will have sold whats left to the Chinese
He hardly won guys we had 2 choices and he was the lesser of the 2 evils it really wouldn't take much to beat him if I was in power I'd be able to win because I know what Australians want. It sux that the 2 parties are run by the same ppl in the background so they are making it so we don't have a choice there will never be a real prim minister unless someone like myself got into power. I wouldn't be bought ever...
Yes Anthony Albanesy
Thank you Australia, for refusing seperatist politics. Dutton tried to seperate us and we stood united. Things are bleak around the world but we are still blessed. Hopefully Labor make the most of these next 3 years.
Also a win for the greens
The Albanese Government have proven themselves with lowered inflation, lowered debt, surplus quarters, low unemployment, interest rates will come down etc. Let’s not forget that the Albanese Government inherited enormous debt from the Liberals previously. Cost of living & housing issues are a global issue, it’s not just contained to Australia. Albo was always the stronger leader - & the people have spoken! Thank goodness Dutton is out. He even lost his own seat. That speaks volumes.
Australia still loses when we get continued mass migration, Net Zero BS, and grovelling to China. The pathetic opposition from the Liberals is 50 responsible for this.
Horray Labor is back
Not Biden Australia, this is going to be hilarious and probably a bit painfull 😢
Housing cost of living and energy sort it out Anthony.....
Defying ICC court order and willingness to  hosting an international criminal,  DOGE style cut,  MAGA agenda  Alignment with Trump idealism. Stupid Neuclear agenda  Are the few things got Dutton dumped
Not surprised given how biased towards Labor channel nine, Seven and ABC is. Croucher is not an impartial journalist either.
I knew  he would  win great
Haha! On ya bike potato head😂
Actions will now speak louder than words, follow through and ensure these far right-wing lovers never ever get a foot in the door again. Aussies have spoken as did the Canadians, the hell with dictatorial want to be politicians. trump's interference was influenced by other agencies; just remember they remain in the background.
Australia is not served by a coalition of big business and farmers. Send the farmer party to where it belongs.
Well Australia,  we've gotten what we ask for. 🙄
Dutton’s arrogant stance on policies and not able to take a tough stance on the atrocities being undertaken by Israel and continuous butt kissing of the US …. What do you expect? Australia needs a leader that puts their head down, pulls up their sleeves and gets things done in the interest of Australians and within the international law (no favours no exceptions)
Yay- The future of Australia is not being built for its people, but bought by those who already own it. As Boomers sit on multiple homes, working families face rising rents, stagnant wages, and broken promises. The system isn't failing—it's functioning exactly as designed - to protect the wealthh of the past, not invest in the future. Until ordinary Australians rise, lead, and build something new, the country will keep drifting further from the people who make it run. Thisbis what we voted for
Sorry gen Z, house prices just increased over night.
I voted liberal. Funny Albanese forgot to inform us he issued 1.2 million visas to Indian students last year. I asked my federal mp Rowland , via email , about this and they semt me a fine for $1700, failure to attend jury duty. I had moved. I Never paid it but it was a distraction. I looked on the net and it was true. The Student visa thing.   Funny how both parties were quiet about this. Plus Chinese student visas and more. I had to move Dec. 2025 and saw the full impact of  the housing crisis. Demand and supply. 😮 Dutton. His plan for nuclear power was ludicrous. Plus medicare cuts. He made those statements 10 years ago. Labor liberal, there is not difference. They are a boys' club with a few token women.
The dunk tank. Jesus christ channel 9.
It's not that I particularly like Labor.  It's that I am repulsed by the Liberal Party.  The most miserable time of my life was when John Howard was running the show.  John Howard didn't even know what computers were used for.  The Liberal Party completely wrecked the NBN with their multi technology mix, which was a total failure.  And now we have fibre to the home, which was Labor's idea which the Libs did everything to thwart.
Anthony Albanese. Now that you have victory, please do what you promised regarding more housing and alt energy. This is why I voted Labor.
Seems like Australians believed the Labor lies and also like high cost of of food petrol electricity  gas energy rents no housing high immigration no defence  anti semitism division by races God help Australia. 😂
Albo albo albo
Watch the statistics soar for people leaving this broken country. No longer the 'lucky country'. Bali here I come.
Sorry but I don't believe that you can tally that many hand written votes in such a short time period.  I do not know a single person who voted labor.  I think it's a lie and that you guys are full of it.  Dutton wasn't a good choice but Albo is way worse.  Green Energy is NOT GREEN and is NOT CHEAP!  He is full of it and he's getting rich on the tax payer funds.  You Australians do not know what you have done and all I can say is do not go whinging to me and all my friends because we do not want to listen to your complaining about how everything has gone up and you can't afford medication anymore.
Australia has spoken and we annihilated the liberal party that aligned itself with Trump rhetoric.  We value all our multicultural citizens and thankfully have a healthcare system among many things that look after our people. I think when people looked at what was happening in America we absolutely decided we want none of that here.
The media buffs it up but both liberal and labout are around a 1/3 of the votes each. None of the parties are wanted.
Grotesque result. Australia is doomed
The Howard government was defeated at the 2007 federal election, with the Labor Party's Kevin Rudd succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat of Bennelong at the election to Maxine McKew, becoming only the second prime minister to do so, after Stanley Bruce at the 1929 election
Labor 'won' ONLY with 24hr a day 365 days cover from the Cowardly Corrupt Media 🔥🦘🇦🇺🔥🦘🇦🇺🔥🦘🇦🇺
Green 0 seat ????? Really. ?????🌹🌱🌹🌱
God help us all
Let’s see if Albo has a permanent solution to all the problems he started
These people need hope back❤❤❤❤❤that's why we gave a voice to fairness and justice.
The goofy dunk tank nonsense though
I really don’t think it’s a ‘rejection of Nuclear Energy… and the direction of the liberal party’  I think it’s just that nobody likes Dutton 🤷‍♂️
stock up on toilet paper and canned food...
Australians rejected Dutton and the Coalition and their propaganda outlets like Sky News and Channel 9
GOD help us all Labor will take us down the drain.
Let see what Labor says next election. After 6 years of serving they wont be able to blame anyone else but thenselves for the mess they create. Hopefully they do better then the last 3 years.
How are people going to feel about Labor when the " Big One " market crash hits, wiping out their Super nest eggs. Answer me that Batman.
It was about time. Congratulations fairness for all finally had its voice.
How good, Pies lost and Albo won. Hecs getting cut also.   Cheers!
Now Australia is in serious trouble.
Dutton is too anti China, and now with the Trump thing, that position would be extremely dangerous for Australia, economically, politically, and militarily. I think many people intuitively sensed it, although bit vaguely and perhaps not in those exact words.
The trump effect is being felt everywhere in the world.
Knew  Labor  win before voting
Yessss❤️🙏🏾
Penny and Anthony’s delivery of acknowledgement of country was fantastic, like a battle cry! Should be delivered like this from this day forward.
150000 businesses close during labors tenure... more of the same to come.
It doesn’t matter who wins. As long as we operate under a FIAT standard, it’s not possible to fix inflation, cost of living, housing affordability etc.. It will only trend worse and degrade the middle class. Everything is down stream of the money
Labor won just because of one reason. When Peter said he will cut jobs in Canberra civil servant. And all over Australia the civil servant and and people working in any government job got scared that they would lose their job. Now government workers will never vote for liberal because they are scared about their job 😂😂😂😂
Rigged
Trump is the only reason for Liberal' loss
This is this end of Australia as we know it. Watch all of albos lies fall through. Its like everyones been living under a rock for the last 3 years. Life is going to get harder for everyone
Pray for all our leaders.. Congratulations Hon Albanese. DO NOT FEAR FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU.. HAVE A BLESSED SUNDAY.
Is 9 news belong to Labor , that’s Sad. So fake
The vote was against Dutton, when weeks ago polls showed that Albo didn’t deserve a second term.  Public has stated though Dutton wasn’t the answer they wanted.
Dutton is a zionist shill. Not a Labor fan, they wont look after the people, but Dutton would've been worse. Having said that, Albo wont do anything to ease the cost of living.
Poor Australian! 😢
I'm disgusted Australia screwed now I'll be on the streets living soon. I think the election was rigged
I thought the cost of living couldn’t get any higher but now Australians have voted for it to get worse 😢
Now you rejoice and tomorrow you will cry that the  Labour Party which is made up of the trade union mafia. When they are in power, they destroy the economy.
It’s official everyone. all us students, academics and first home buyers are all screwed. Thank you Albanese, you have officially ruined Australia.
People are scared of the nuclear reactors being close to their homes,
Six years of labour ahead. Trumpisim has been trumped
eggs were $1.99  a dozen    2 years ago now they are $ 9.95 a dozen  GST on that is also making the government a pile of money . which has been spent  on a pile of advertisements to re elect the politician pirates again  well done people  eggs will soon be $20.00  a dozen and you will be happy to pay that amount also .
Oh Jesus this is not good 😮
Thanks, trump. We couldn't have done it without you.
No working from home? No political career.
Congrats
An other three ugly years of albo and wong ,something is wrong
Bullwinkle???
Temu Trump lost his seat together with Murdoch, nice one.
Well here we go again the same old mistake they make every election not backing medi care enough when are they ever going to learn I guess  never
Hope Australia is ready for 3 million more indian neighbours and even higher inflation.
Peter Dutton is a warmonger.. google his vids talking abour war with China .. good riddens
stupid is as stupid does.
All the new imports and young fools have  voted this country is doomed
Race ya down the Travel Agency, were are all screwed now..
God help Australia as nobody else will.
RIP Aus... a hardline communist leader will now throw you down the same path of disaster the whole of Europe went down. You will NEVER recover from this
Dutton: No Depth ,No Statesmanship, No Justice, No Voice ,No Leader .
Do u guys realise that if dutton won, he was going to cut off our medical care. Since he runs it?  This country is Fk up.  Yes, but I would rather not have dutton as a prime minister. If he is going to cut off medical care. We're F.  Usually, I don't give a f about the politics. But I wouldn't want medical care to be cut off.
Australia's response to Canada's election: hold my beer!!! 🤣😂😂
I bet Dutton gets a consultant job for a mining company ,ez street
Trying to push the trump agenda, pushed himself out lmao...
<3 <3 <3 <3 Congratulations are in order. Now Mr. Albanese, introduce the Mining Tax or you'll be going the same way as Dutton. Please? <3 <3 <3 <3
Look after yourself. Be kind😊
Labor party deserves to win the election again, I predict Labor will win the third term.
That "dunk tank" segment was wildly asinine (and I was happy to see Dutton ousted).
They are all the same
We needed Liberal to win, nooo!
Let's welcome in another 3.5 million migrant home buyers for the glutinous housing bubble and so your grandchildren won't be able to buy houses. Let alone ourselves and why not leave them some more fat debt and less personal rights and communism to go with it. Well done Australia and well done to the communist propaganda machine and albo.
Another dictator gone with the wind  for ever....he should see these  public comments...how far is popular among the Australian public...congrats Labor !!
Fix the costs of living now.
Aus has spoken, we don't want to be like America and run by a TemuTrump. Not only that, Labor won by a MAJORITY! I personally believe the "Make Australia Great Again" comment is what got everyone to go Labor.. That was the turning point. Libs owned themselves with that.
Well Mr Dutton you should have spoken up about the stupid comment about Maga from your mate who can't remember she said it
Heaven help Australia
Dutton gave it away on a silver plate like Hoseface Harris did in the USA !!! I hope he retire from politics !!!!
스윙 한국은 몰라...스윙으로 이겼네 이건기회을 준거야 잘해라 노동당.
it's so over. I've never been upset over an ellection result but I really think this is going to be absolutely terrible for the future of our country. Most importantly how we are now being turned away from the cheapest and cleanest form of energy in nuclear power and the absolutely terrible porecedent taxing unrealised gains will set for future governments to exploit...
Making a mock of these people and  laughing about them is a discrace
We need to fix the voting in this country,  we only have two partys to pick from , independents are point less if they give their votes to labour or liberal
As much a rebuke of Trumpism as cruelty. I'm proud of Australia. And Dutton was extremely gracious in his concession speech, proving Aussies are nothing like Yanks.
We showed we love Albo.Landslide Win❤❤❤
Libs probably need a better leader and powerful leadership to prepare the next one 😂,  don't forget basic jobs in encouraging more people to come up with support.
🎉🎉🎉
"Labour" the "Most Beautiful Word In The Dictionary"
The media is full of lies Labor will struggle 😂😂😂
Thank you Australia ❤🇦🇺!!! You learned from our mistakes in the US. Thank you to Canada, Australia, and Germany!!!  You don’t want the US insanity. Aussies made a smart decision.
we are  now screwed for another 3 years
Absolutely terrible.
Good riddance Dutton. Corrupt and incompetent.
Cost of living crisis caused by the LNP
Albo, stay humble! Take this opportunity make timely needed reformation, just like Bob Hawke enforcing Medicare, and Paul Keating with superannuation scheme.
Labor didn't win.., the Librals lost.., the population is very short sighted .., we're going to be woke and broke..,
항상승리할순없어요 한국좀배워라. 제발..
Where has everyone been for the last three years? Prepare to suffer.
Senator Price..."Make Australia Great Again.  Take your Trump politics and shove it where the sun don't shine.
Im dreading these next 3 years. I'm not a fan of dutton so glad hes not in but also not a fan of albanese, we honestly had a horrible choice between two party leaders. I just want cost of living and prices of homes to drop, thats all i want
Stunning and brave. Did Albo cry again?
I left home to vote for Dutton but when I got home I realised I'd voted for a hard boiled egg by mistake.
TEMU trump lost 😂
No to taking away work from home
Australians have spoken loud and clear 😂  No to Trump"s influence on our politics..
3 more years of mediocre, incompetent rule by the Left. Advance, Australia, where?
yeh voting with a pencil people in this country are cooked
Way down we go
Without Trump, I won’t vote for Labor. A party got problems better than a party dangerous.
Get ready for India and Middle east to out number us Aussies
최고입니다...한번더 기회을노동당에게 요... 호주는 정치 멋집니다...
Its not Albo or Dutton its Trump who AGAIN won(!) people’s hearts at home and abroad 🤣 The first phone call from Albo should be to POTUS thanking him for the landslide victory.
Congratulations  you are the best primer ministro tank you ,you did what we want the valios for old ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The Liberals did come across as very beige.  They are still functioning on the Morrison style government. They failed to elevate their best people and replaced them with clowns in suits.
Dutton said the LNP didn't do well enough throughout the campaign... Wrong Spud... Australians could see your behaviour ... You'd rather Australia fail, than give any credit to Labor... You're pathetic...
That maybe have a chance to end of AUKUS.
Votes have consequences!
No Too Dictator Dutton No Dirty Nuc power, we don't need another trump in this world thanks.
At last Dutton can't help Trump to Make Australia Grounded Again.🤣🤣🤣
I'm loving that the greens have 0 seats so far, I think they will have 1 by the end of counting tho
Obviously people need to be homeless and broke don't complain when you can't afford to live bunch on nuts
Australians rejected Dutton and his stupid political views.
Doesnt matter who we pick, Albo will keep letting people in the country, will keep house pricing going up and destroying the country, they all worried about their pensions not Australia
Just like how Canadian Conservative party leader lost his own seat last week! This is what happens when these parties try to align themselves in any way with Trump.
Rampant socialism isn't a good thing ,Generations will be paying for it
Today Australia decided not to follow the racist facist ways America and Trump is trying to spin the world and I couldnt he prouder.
He never won the liberals need new policies
i love prime minister ❤❤❤ Thonny Albanese…
Congratulations  Labor 🎉😘
How long till the Libs start blaming migrants for their loss?
Yes123 again ?!
Electorate said no to murdoch as well.
Mission accomplished enough votes imported for a win. No australian values with this guy.
The LNP needs to get back to their core value's.  They are no longer the conservative party.
Now deliver on what was promised.
Australia is a Muslim Islamic country same as Iran or irag or
Wow! The Trumpist accepted responsibility for this failure!
God help us
Good bye Australia
Unfortunately the person who offered more money to people won over the person who offered more hope to people ( and the country ). It really was a wake up call on how greedy people have become, and before you post a smart ass comment about the people have spoken, just think that you may be one of the greedy people.
It’s not how good ALP and shown how worse LNP😂
Time to leave
no trumpism in Australia !
Can't wait to pay higher taxes for the next 3-4 years, its going to be so great
Im moving to the US this coutry is screwed. What sheep we have become! The woke mind has just killed this beautiful country
Australia you can't complain now, another 3 tough years ahead
This is my first vote and I am a new citizen and voted for Labor.  So glad for Labor victory!!!
Still unbelievable a white wash if it was a sport like rugby league
Australians have no idea what we have done. Unrealised capital gains is gonna trigger a recession we have never seen before.  Get ready for super, property prices, ASX to all collapse.
How much are the price of eggs? The question that killed Dutton the Mutton’s career.
England, Canada now Australia.. 😡😡😡
remember Joni Mitchell predicted this disaster in the song. Big Yellow Taxi. Cut down all the trees and put them in a tree museum, charge the people a dollar and a half just to see them. This is what Mr magoo and WEF are planning for us all. How could anyone vote for this. WEARE SCREWED people  Thanks a lot. AEC is compromised
Thank you to the separatists brethren tax payer funded organisation if you at least traded with the people who support your existence  maybe someone would of taken you seriously get em Albo
The people of Australia have thrown the bloody LIBS and the bloody NATS in the garbage bin.
Thank God that racist Gastapo bold head lost
I am no longer proud to be an aussie. Wow i cant believe how dumb this country is how the hel did we let this happen. Well we're all screwed now. Congratulations people be prepared you did this and have now secured australias ruin
All the centerlink bros mad asf
Australia voted against racism
Shouldn't still be working from home rubbish that was only introduced when the fake virus was in 2020 . and for so many people reckon albo is doing a crappy job how come he got back in must be all the big city people that don't live in the real world
❤
Albo is Aussie as it comes🤩
Is it true that labour is going to withdraw the billion dollars? It pays to the maggots at ABC and if not why not?
Wonder if his rent a bride rewarded little albo for the rigged win
Dutton and his mates in airwaves openly campaigning for him should know what the public thinks. All their efforts were useless!
All the wrong policies LOL. Big NO for mini-trump and trying to change a Coal/Solar nation to Nuclear 😂
Australia doesnt want any trump crap.  Sucked in Dutton!
Dutton made a speech at George Pells funeral how could you vote for him
Crazy what happens when you flood swing electorates with immigrants. Who would have thought.
Bold eg, join with kamala 😂
Congratulation ! Anthony.
Peter Dutton and his blind following to Trump killed the chances for Lib. .unfortunately he did not connect well with public. He was a cop so his speech clearly reflected he was more of a dictator than a leader.
Dutton was just not good enough.  End of. I’m glad he didn’t win it.
Australia had cancer now its metastasized to terminal.  You will all regret this lurch towards communism .... as Venezuela has.
With the amount of lies he sprouted  he really wanted the job
Someone please confirm this is real!
Australia is finished. Watch every freedom, asset, savings get stolen from everyone including kids and grandkids who will have to payback trillions in debt. Remember that Albanese,Wong and head of AEC had private secret meetings with XI.
We said a big NO to taking away “work from home” and all the negativity from Dutton and the Libs. What a disaster for them
Congratulations Labor ♥️🙏 from NZ 🇳🇿🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Thanks Trump, you were good for something after all....
proof positive that AEC has been compromised. This country is totally screwed. No way in hell was Labor win genuine. Now just a small step to total WEF control.
Lucky Ozzies
Thank you Trump, and here's hoping to a most productive Labor term!  2 permanent tax cuts which will compound until retirement, a 20% wipe-out of HECS debt, universal bulk billing for all, the largest housing budget since WW2 to actually address supply constraints, making free TAFE permanent, and a return of manufacturing to Australia.  There's lots to be excited for!
Thankyou trump,albos greatest asset
the nation said no to American BS
