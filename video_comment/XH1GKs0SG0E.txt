Balanced how? With an aging injury prone quarterback? Or maybe the nonexistent run game or suspect offensive line. And who’s their other receivers? Exactly. Dallas is in for a long year. They may be competing with the Jets for that number one pick. Speaking of balanced . We will see a demonstration of that used against them on opening day. That one could get ugly.
When has Dallas had a GREAT defense since 2016??? When have they had a run defense...at all? What year were they not a most penalized team since 2016?? When? Yet Shady is still stuck on stupid blaming Dak for Dallas' failures. WTF. Smh.
Shady is trash talkin..... #4 had bullshyt coaching and u know it. Jason Garrett aint ever won and Mike McCarthy won ONCE..... Philly placed an entire team around Jalen  to throw for 200 yards per game WHY bc they went out and got the best RB in the game to get the chip NOT JALEN....stop it. The entire organization has to see the same picture.
JJ has FINALLY had enough. He said he always gets what he wants and no matter how much money he’s got, he’s running out of time ⌛️ — so let’s do this!!!!
They  sho are. Dem. Boyz have simultaneously eliminating white players off the rosters .nonw drafted  jn last two drafts enter will. Mcclay .personell dieector scouting going on 22 years what ha ha e bust after bust esp on defensive vethey won.since then .he and his bias scouting. Stafl cant judge defensive linemen line backers edge rushers still don't have nose tackle .been like fhis for years .oh yeah willmcclay isnt he theone that drafted taco charlton and passed on tj watt .and then tristian hill and next genius move mZi.smith newest ust all these picks top picks  got nothing in return for fhem. Wasted picks .and has affected d line .to thi day and jones  gave him and bustmaster staff new contract for what ? More cailure mcclay and staff need to go asap.bias abounds woke boyz organization 🐺👀
Now I really think he’s a Dak Prescott hater
Name 1 issue Goerge Pickens has been in OFF the field 🤔
Cowboys may have talent but they aren't a serious organization anymore.  They're the KISS of the NFL.
Mr Pickens was a great pick up for the offense Go Cowboys 😊
Some people want to know why it’s never daks fault. ?? He Can play horrible time a time again. Still blaming someone else.. one day some will come to realize. Dak isn’t the guy .
Dak it’s really on u if yall can’t do it it’s really on u unless i see really otherwise, which is either line or pass rush
Acho loves the sound of his voice, just babbling
Shady didn’t do anything either in playoffs he hoped on good teams to chase rings
Move on hater
I guarantee it's gonna be the same story again next year with the Cowboys garbage
I swear Dak stole Shady's girl at one point.
Even if we got Pickens, Dak needs to get him the ball which is not happening in a consistent basis. Plus their schedule is brutal. I see them winning 4 games only. Good luck Cowboys.
That defense needs a defensive tackle otherwise I think they might be ok if Dak stays healthy and their offensive line is okay
Yep Dak destroyed Dez career.....
Once a hater always a hater, everytime he is ask a question, he changes the question and deflect. Cant get a striaght yes or no answer about Dallas being a better geam now.
They dont need the best of pickens. If he does this year just what he did last year with terrble qb play. What they need is health from prime position players and the d needs to stop getting thrashed by every team they face running game.
Been saying this for years I’m a Philly fan dak is a good QB ima different system it ain’t Dallas …. Dallas is just like buffalo good in the post season but ALWAYS CHOKES IN the playoffs
If dak goes back to doing bootlegs N RPO’s I think they will be dangerous that’s as far as I kan go  Got to c waaaa the season has
Shady just being shady 😂 hating dallas
I had Dallas at 8 wins. Now 10--11.
Trade deadline? What can fix then? Middle of the D?
Four of the biggest clowns they'll give anybody a microphone and call it a NFL podcast .
I agreed that Dak never plays good in the playoffs. Why? I don't know why.
Shaky Shady trembling, can’t you hear the fear in his voice! That’s high school cafeteria hype! Trembling Shaky Shady!🤭🤭
Go Cowboys!
Can dak do better ? Yes! But every man on that field is. Professional athlete .. but coaching was an issue and Jerry is an issue but let’s speak this into existence, cowboys deep playoff run 2026! We’re at least rebuilding much better imo .. I’m cowboys fan lose, win or draw and  I love Dak off the field 100% and on the field 80% which imo 80% is. Good QB .. get the run game going so Dak can play action
RAVENS
You know you cheeks you better not open up as cold
Cowboys stop the cap
Dakota isn't the COWBOYS ! So just answer the question Shady!
I'm a bona fide Cowboys fan since 1976-77 and watched my share of Cowboys games and The year Dallas played in San Fran can't remember what year but the defense played a good game but they were on the defense was on the field too long Dak played his worst game after playing his best game against the Bucs and maybe some teams just have your number and the 49ers has Daks number let's just keep it real Shouldn't be an excuse if the injury bug don't hit the Cowboys
Micah  needs  a real threat at nose guard to attempt the superbowl
The cowboys are still cheeks let's be honest  the front 4 changes teams not skill players
Dak has had talent in the past and did nothing! It's all about Dak....
Lol none of this matters cause the hand in power over the nfl have the game rigged.
Lions and eagles most balanced offenses cowboys can’t run the ball
25 is just a hater period!
It doesn't matter when your QB sucks.
As a Steelers fan … the cowboys just hit gold getting Pickens. And this move come playoffs will show! It’s no way Dak can mess this up!
He’s a buzzkill, always bad mouths the cowboys… no respect for him at all.
THAT BALL THAT THE LEAGUE FINALLY CLARIFIED AS A CATCH,WAS THROWN BY DAK ,AND WASNT THAT A SHOOT OUT AGAINST GB,QUIT RIDING A B.S. NARATIVE J.J...,IF THATS THE CASE DAK WOULD BE UP FOR MVP WICH HE CLEARLY HAD BETTER STATS THAN LAMAR
😂😂 still 🗑️💯
Jake Ferguson is totally unreliable
Then if the cowboy's don't go to the Super Bowl this year, (2025) then they should get a better, younger, and smarter QB and that's Shedeur Sanders.
Don’t forget Tolbert and the other rookie RB out of Clemson
Dak is WaK! True is does not throw the 50/50 ball. He better learn real quick. Pickens is ALWAYS open.
6:00 SHADY is right. It's Dak 100% he just ain't that guy. He plays poorly against good teams.
Dak havent best  beat a good team in a regular season since the 2016 Steelers name a regular season team besides the Steelers that year was good that he has to beating
He could even throw the ball to Gallup to Gallup right why is chase Daniel's on tv
Pickens makes Dallas the “most balanced offensive team in the NFL” 😂 ok💯
It's going to be a problem either way....either Pickens will complain he ain't getting the ball enough or Lamb will complain he ain't getting the ball enough
The only reason I put a thumbs up on this cowgirl conversation cause shady mc coy is speaking facts noting matters if the same bust QB is still there dak Prescott with him as there QB they ain't doing nothing 💯%listen to what shadys saying he' hit it on the nails 💯%
You right shady Dak washed
This is some funny 💩
Hey (25) Is always Gonna be Just That until He's proven Wrong (2025/Cowboys &(Dak,Cee Cee Lamb, & George Pickens) are Coming for His (Eagles, Commanders, & The (Giants) ain't Even ready)
The NFC East is all about the Eagles and the Commanders this year.  Dallas and New York will be making S'more around a campfire come playoff time.  Seriously, there are alot of Cowboy fans that need to get counseling.
They could be so good....but the most rigged team in the nfl....all big markets are. La...houston. mew york. All big markets will have big names but be bad in season. Thank vegas
Shady is such a hater..
How are you the most balanced with no run game 🤔
Keep the Ravens name out of your mouth! Emmanuel
Ehhh🤷🏻‍♂️
Dude right what about the playoffs!!! And dak a bum he ruin player's career period!!!
George Pickens is working on a podcast like Micah Parsons. We all know they like to TALK and run their mouth. But at the end of the day, SAME RESULTS. I skipped this segment
George Pickens is no #2 WR ❗️ He’s a clear cut number 1. Even with #88 already in the building. Pickens is actually better than Lamb. Like ya’ll said it’s on Dak now❗️ But Dak is on the clock ⏰ with Joe Milton in the building. I’m mad 😡 as a Commanders fan that they got Joe Milton & George Pickens.
Who throwing him the ball tho
Lol they've been dem boys for the last 30 years I think it's time for a change
Pickens isn't that great at all. I'd take 20 receivers maybe more over him.
Cowboys have not had a good 1 and 2 duo since Amari and Ceedee. Towards the end of Amari being with the cowboys he was out almost every week with a foot injury.
YOU STILL HAVE PLAY THE GAMES AND DAK A PROVEN CHOKER SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HES LIKE THE 14TH BEST QB WITH A GIMP LEG RELAX.
To be fair, Dez started dealing with injuries after Romo left. And he couldn't rely on route running, after his speed and agility started declining..Gallop has a similar style to Pickens, and Dak had good chemistry with him.
Mean while dak Micheal Gallup and Dez were grabbing 50/50 balls majority off the time lol of toe tapping btw
Didn't Pickens have 6 drops last season?
Sorry yah lost me at Dak won’t throw the 50/50. He’s had the highest rating of having to throwing to tight windows the last few seasons. Mainly because Mike had em running down field and turning around..
I truly wish I was joking when I say that anytime I see Shady I have to end the video. He's always so negative unless its his Eagles. ANYTIME, it's anything about the Cowboys, he hates. I can't watch anything he talks about anymore strictly because I know whether news is good or bad, he's going to hate
Sorry dawg, just because you said nice things and made us happy we can’t save you from them thangs.. let skip have his turn.     PS Jerry has a good lawyer
He didn’t bring up the defense giving up all those rush yards in the playoff loses, what a bot😆😆
Picken unlock Turpin one of fastest player in the slot an Tolbert bc they got playing time last year  dak going to have the best receiving core
Jerry Jones is going to let him go to Free Agency at the end of the season
Only person that got FLEECED was Jerry Jones, should of never signed Dak Prescott to a 60 million dollar contract, Cowboys got robbed just like the Cleveland Browns did
I think shady had Crush on Dak
Defense was never really legit nobody could stay healthy all year together
Balanced???? I’ll take delusion for $200 Alex
And now a Joe Milton as back up QB
As a cowboys fan shady makes sense this time . Dak has had the help!!!
Here it goes agian media and cowboys fans gush and this is the year so we get 6 months of cowboys on every talk show then the collapse and we get six months of what are the cowboys going to do
All of that for only 1 of 2 things to happen. They either go 13-4 and lose in the 1st round, OR they totally miss the playoffs all together. Those are legit the only 2 options. It's just what Dallas does
To answer acho it’s the eagles
This is THE MOVE, they've been needing to make this move 10-15 years ago,look at all you super bowl teams all have dominant DT, look at the majority of your deep running playoffs teams they all have solid DT that can stop the run, if they don't commit to dominant DT's it will be the same Ole same ol dallas cowboys 20-30 years of over hyped over paid and not worth watching
Hey shady Dak has played better in the playoffs than you ever did my dude lets look at your career numbers in the playoffs 250 yards 1 td in 7 games
Shady n his takes are 🫏 💩
Facts! Cowboys coming....
SUPER BOWL BOUND
Cowboys 7-10,at best 3'rd in division maybe 4'th
Dak is 9-4 against the Eagles shady
All the draft picks and Pickens all the free agents on defense is gonna be fun to watch.
Wait he play rb or o-lineman?
Shady shouldn’t be allowed to talk on TV 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣 George is still going to be a problem because he ain't getting the ball enough
Hey @TheFacilityonFS1, the video repeats from 5:19 - 9:48. It's almost like it's been the same take on every topic related to the Cowboys. Might want to look into that. I would say it might be the AI you use, but AI is mostly factually unbiased.
Now he throw the 50/50 and the wr doesn’t come down with it. They gonna bash dak. Dak don’t throw the 50/50 they gonna bash dak 🤣
Cowboys? Meh!
Shady lives off his hate of Dallas
9>88=🙅🏼‍♀
I love the Facility. You guys are a bunch of football guys who actually know what you are talking about.
McCoy spittin facts
The did not have zeke in 2023-24
Did we forget who’s the QB? Cowboys still gonna suck 🤣
I'll still take JJ, Addison, Hockenson and the Vikings Oline and RB's basically the same things they said the Cowboys have and the Vikings actually have a defense. Cowboys still giving up 30 a game.
😂😂😂😂 these dudes are groupies pickens is unstable and they still have dak😂😂😂 the shyt gotta work clowns
Locker room will be in shambles by week 5
Cowboy Fan right here who agrees totally with Shady‼️ Dallas has had an elite team with Dak and Dak has CHOKED twice in games the Cowboys should have won. Two Playoff games in particular Cowboys had a chance to comeback and beat the RAMS in the playoffs the year RAMS won their last SuperBowl‼️ Dak choked against the 49ers in the playoffs threw 2 unnecessary interceptions and he actually took the weight for that. Shady is spot on 💯%‼️‼️‼️
How dumb do u have to be to think this trade adds 4 wins .. lol
Hahaha... oh cowboys .. its so cute how every year you think you made huge moves... only to find out around week 11 that you're still not making the playoffs again
Question for Shady McCoy.....How well did Jalen Hurts and the Eagles perform in big game situations BEFORE the acquisition of Saquan Barkley? He was good but the addition of Barkley took their offense to another level. Give Dallas and Prescott the same grace that was extended to the Eagles and Hurts!!!
Trade dak to saints so cowboys can start joe Milton. Whole new team
Steelers know when to get rid of a wr when they on a down fall...claypool brown, sanders, juju...and shady is right theyve had a good oline before they had great wrs before...
Just when we thought it might be a full off-season without Dallas. Here comes this trade and instantly everybody goes back to crowning the COWGIRLS.
They do know that defense has changed right!!
It looks like most of the offense problem were addressed little by little, except for the most important position. No matter how good a team they could build, as long as they have Dak Prescott
The cowboys have always had the best wide receivers. Where's that gotten them in the past 30 years😂
Acho is a little bit biased don't you think?😂
So before they got Pickens, they were one of the worst teams in the league But now that they added pickinns they're the most balanced team in the league. Acho is a joke sometimes
The most balanced squad without a running game😂😂😂 that makes a whole lot of sense there. Acho
You forgot about Phil Mafah Acho
Shady droppin dimes
Except for Emmanuel sanders and juju … most troubled Steeler WR’s that leave never play the same! this will be no different. Gp is good to be GP! 😂😂😂
Why would you expect anything else from shady? Always a hater in the group
What happened to the white  dragt prospects woken heimer . And of course will mcclay didn't draft any same thing as last year white player are a endangered species . On this woke Boyz . Organization sys thematically eliminating them off the team bias abounds. . 🐺👀
Listen good move but that defense gives up too many yards on the ground.. They didn’t get better defensively, not to mention the headaches of lamb and Pickens when they don’t get the ball. Dak is not a great qb injuring prone rookie head coach I’m good
Sick n tired of shady.. hows it feel to ALWAYS HAVE THAT D IN YOUR MOUTH!!!!
Joe Milton up next big arm throws the deep ball and 50/50 balls and can run 14:18 and Pickens ain’t had no real QB his whole time at Pittsburgh let’s Be real
Joe Milton up next big arm throws the deep ball and 50/50 balls and can run
It's obvious these guys don't even watch film. Just reading that old book brown spots on the wall by who flung poo
Cowboys All way's been that team you didn't like that
We gotta stop acting like Jerry Jones does this stuff. Let's start giving Will McClay his credit
Tag him and devide salary by 2 great deal
All that with no QB, go cowboys
Im pickers  us 2 win!!!
So if the Cowboys were this complete of a team, then why weren't we talking about them in such a positive light prior to this Pickens trade? All of a sudden they have a really good OL, RB stable and defense now that they signed George Pickens 😂😂 That doesn't make any sense And Acho saying that a receiver like Pickens can increase a team's win total by 3 is absolutely absurd. Hard to watch.
Shadys right, Dak needs to learn how to stop the run and not give up 40 plus points.......
Acho was hilarious when he brought Miles Sanders RB as a weapon 😂😂
George Pickens adds 3 to 4 wins? Come on. Steelers traded the player for a reason.  He's not 1 of the best WRs in football. Like, seriously let's be real. He's a good player that could never be the 1, solid but not 1 of the best at his position.
Shady is such a clown
Shady hate will always hate even after a SB (hopefully) this man will hate
Superbowl bound baby ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Acho got his goggles on and is seeing the Cowboys as a Madden roster lol.   In real life, NFL teams are constantly reminded how the difficult but talented player ends up being more difficult than talented. Usually to the point where the juice ends up not being worth the squeeze. Maybe Pick will be different as he goes from being a clear cut 100+ target #1 to a 70-ish target #2 in a contract year lol 🤷🏾‍♂️.
I came here just to hear the stupidity  No wonder Trump is the president
Take shady off the air already
Losers way they say
BRANDON Cooks come on now Shady being the number  two for Dak is crazy . Would he be enough  if that was Jaylon Hurtz number two receiver.
I agree Dak Prescott is known having trouble reading elites defense...    Jerry Jones has to have the mindset that Dak will get hurt..  Needs to have the young back up ready.
Milton gone take Dak job
James jones must not have watched Gallup pre ACL tear to say dak ain’t throwing 50/50 balls
Lmfao Dallas can't stop the run can't run acho is a cowboys fan and said it next subject
IF IF IF.  IF Pickens stops being who he has been all his football life then this could be great. How many guys at such a young age suddenly stop being who they are? No doubt he has the talent ... when he feels like playing.  The big question here is can a rookie coach manage what one of the best player coaches got tired of trying to manage. I give him 25% chance. For the Jerry it's a good bet.
Dak James harden of the NFL
Turn it off as soon as they go to Shady. Most annoying dude on TV.
George ain't want to give up that 14 let's say that 😂😂😂
Shady is the biggest Cowboys hater. Idk why anyone even asks him questions about the team. Dude can never make a non bias take. 😂
James thank you for speaking on the Dez situation. Brandon Cooks? 👀
I know first dude did not say Tyler Guyton is a future All-Pro player lol? Did he watch any tape from this dude his rookie season, dude was a absolute liability smh.
People saying George Pickens has no on field problems are liar’s He’s literally quit in the middle of routes smh😂
It's so easy to blame the QB But Dak Prescott hasn't had a team around him.This is a new era and the Joneses moving differently
Hater McCoy. How'd anyone know that he'd be the one questioning the move?
Don't u need a offense line to give dak time ask mahomes how,did that work out for him
11 12 wins 😂😂😂😂😂
Good luck with George he is talented but he can't follow rules definitely not going to like being #2 WR and I'm sorry #4 isn't the QB he needs thankfully we got rid of him in Pittsburgh DK Metcalf 💥
Yeah I guess Zeke getting 30 touches a game played zero role in dez getting the ball less. That was all on Dak
Yeah I guess Zeke getting 39 touches a game played zero role in dez getting the ball less. That was all on Dak
Shady hates the cowboys and Dak so much his analysis of anything football is a joke😂
Shay only hates the cowboys for ratings.  Taking a page out of Stephen A Clown Smiths book
It’s a shame the main points were made at the very end of this drawn out conversation
Is McCoy still on this show.....  I'll check back in a month...  he's useless and the world's biggest hater
Where was this great defense shady talking about 😂
Man this show is what’s wrong w the cowboys. Yall are trying to blame everything on Dak. STOP CREATING THIS TOXIC NARRATIVE. Dak does not play defense!!!!!
Culture in that building will matter more than the talents they have assembled. A win and everybody is laughing then a loss and figure pointing and dysfunction 😂😂😂nothing new unless the culture is right❤✌️
I’m glad people are still sleeping on the Cowboys. I think they’re gonna find out that their run game this year and their run defense is going to be totally different this year.
I Hope Dak Prescott Proves all These Jokers Wrong. #2 in MVP Race (Shoulda Won That!) I hope he Wins it all!!! GO Cowboys!!!
Shady would sound a lot smarter with his mouth closed
Tyler Guyton 🤣 lmao oh your serious
Facts shady and I’m a cowboys fan
The delusion here is legendary. As long as Jerruh is the owner god king trump making all the decisions for everything in mgmt youll never go anywhere in the playoffs. He is not willing to tank or rebuild and keeps throwing money in the wrong places. Too much in 3 stars yet again.
BRO IM A COWBOY FAN AND I APPLAUD SHADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the same procedure as every year
Name another person thats simultaneously annoying and anticlimactic simultaneously irritating and listhpy simultaneouthly provides dumb and irrelevant expertise
shady you a hater
This division is becoming like the 90s again
Bro if he doesnt get 6-8 targets per game its gonna be a mess
I don’t see next years qb class being all that good idk what I’m missing
Someone  get Shady out of ther makes me sick
The Pittsburgh Steelers are not going to make the Playoffs this Yea‼️🚨🚩💯🚩🚩
Shady is jealous and afraid for the Eagles. He's so Selfish, always getting weapons at Philly. Then as soon as a Contender in the Division get compatible, he start.hating!
This is a steal for the Cowboys with this pickup!!! It's about time for the Cowboys to get two great Receivers!
Dak Prescott stays healthy with these Receivers,, the Cowboys will make the Playoffs. Dallas will be a scary Team this year and Dak might become an MVP QB this year!!!
Would someone tell shady Dak don't play defense!
Shady talking about the weapons on DEFENSE but fails to bring up the defense was non existent in the playoffs
Dak definitely dont throw receivers open thats factz
U forget the fact of being led by the most inconsistent QB DAK TRASHCOTT!! All the unicorns and magic dust doesn't change or fix the QB situation!! So no more excuses Quack Trashcott!!😂😂
Lolololol. Dallas sucks. Go birds. 🦅
Terrible take by  acho
I’m not racist but damn these white folks were better at doing these shows …
Only thing I disagree with is the oline statement. The Oline is young and still has a lot to prove. If guyton doesn’t get better the oline is cooked.
Shady you suck your not a analyst just a Hater asshole
Who F*cked Joy Taylor on this panel?
Cowboys drafted a DAWG from texas and beefed that line up...they've got 2 dual threat TE's TWO legit #1 wr's and two wr's who can play the middle for heavy yards. THE DEFENSE,  is the biggest concern.
Ok, all this talk about offense. We want to hear about the defense
Yah a bunch of receivers prescott won't be able 2 hit in stride. Didn't we already do this whole PRESCOTT just don't have the receivers lamb and copper
claypool 2.0
even with pickens the cowboys will get 9 wins at best.
They always want to prop up the Cowboys  even when they're garbage  all these shows because because they believe the public wants to hear about nothing but the Cowboys
theyre in the same division with my eagles and the commanders. enough said...
Defense and coaching has lost us the past 2 playoffs not dak
Dak has missed the playoffs like 1 time healthy if dak plays they make playoffs
Jerry jones has never gotten dak help 😂😂 this Zeke tony pollard yall was talking about all yall said they was trash but now that dak gets help it’s he’s always have help the double standards are crazy 😂
This puts us in 12 13 14 win category we been 11 wins minimum when dak plays so with Pickens we should get atleast 13 or 14
Damn man. This video was actually informative and very solid until McCoy started speaking. Why do y’all let this man talk when he has no good opinions??? Solely just hates to hate. Such weird behaviour man. This guy makes this show a lot worse.
Shady just a hater lol stay on the agenda, stay on topic, answer the question on what the take is about.
And still won’t touch commander and damn sure not eagles.
I agree with Shady
Now go get Isaiah Bond
Our backs are overrated. The broncos just got rid of him knowing they need a back for a reason
Dallas literally has "2" top 5 receivers....😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Listen to all of chase takes he speaks good about every player & team besides the eagles players & team 😂😂😂 that dude a joke
Him And Joy talk the same
Did James J. just say Dak doesn't let the ball go when he had 3 1000 yrds receivers Cooper, Lamb, and Gallup in a season, he skipped to talk about when Dak was a rookie and when Zeke was the man also boy the Dak hate on this show!!
Shady forgets that its the defense that wins games. The offense is what needs to not play terrible. Evertime the cowboys play in the big moments its everyone. The defense doesnt show up and the weapons cant catch and RBs cant run and you got Dak trying his best with everything crumbling around him. Hurts is actually trash but everything around him is elite and no one crumbled in the big moments. Yall forget that Dez was nowhere near his elite level when Dak played with him 😂😂😂. Jokers as always
Shady came in the with commons sense recall. "What are talkin about?" lmao
Shady ….. loves to take Cowboy takes to down Dak. Very predictable
Y’all too funny y’all guys just be doing smoke in the air shady is the only one that think with logic
Chase said the Steelers dont think 900 yds and 4 tds is worth 30 million dollars. Ironically, those are DK's stats, too and he got 30 million...
Best stuff on the internet
Shut your big mouth up, quit making Dak look back all the time, you guys are ridiculous Dak is a top 5 QB, this is why I don’t watch you talking head MF’s, I’m so surprised you still have a job, boy bye ✌️  DC4L💙🩶
Is shady mentally disabled ???
Where’s joy @?????
Omg can u beat the champs twice no u can't
The lions acho… the mf lions🤷🏾‍♂️
Every year the same damn story, cowboys being one of best teams in league, then dak turns around and fks it all up
I’m a cowboys fan but the eagles are hands down the best offense in the league
Ringo 😂😂😂 Star?
James is such a Dak hater 😂😂😂
No running game no left tackle. Two Diva  Wr. What could possibly go wrong 😂
Buddy has BUTTERFINGERS
Im a hardcore cowboys fan. But this isint the first time dak has a super bowl caliber offense. DAK IS NOOOOOT IT. History shows what he does when it gets tough.
Problem is Dak
No more excuse for Dak now cuz you have decent running backs and 2 great receivers Sheesh Dak this might be your last chance if you cant win at least 10 or 11 games with this team Sheesh
And they have Dak Prescott
What’s Pickens off the field problems?
So the defense getting 45 dropped on them was on #4 ?
McCoy broke Montgomery record hmm
We still need a quarterback and some more work on defense Dak is not an elite quarterback
These running backs are gonna need to be lethal because, Dak struggles , he’s not the best at delivering, so this is as best as it gets for Dak
Omg this was the final piece they needed. Omg Super Bowl. Super Bowl bound. 🤣
lol keep telling yourself that when they have another 5 and 13 season like usual lol. if they have dak the quack there not going any where.
How does anyone still take anything out of shady with any credibility? The dude is a clown and low IQ.
Just like his quarterback Hurts did until they got Barkley right?
Pickens is a headache, he's probably bad for the locker room.
They have absolutely nothing in the backfield and who is going to play the Z when Lamb is in the slot ? Tolbert ?   At least it's a break from the Sanders discourse
It's the Cowboys. These mofos get paid to hype the Cowboys, knowing they gonna lose over and over again. 10-11 wins just to lose win it counts.
but shady you left the eagles!
Shady lying last season Zeke played with Dallas, Gilmore was with the Vikings.  The year before Zeke was with the Patriots Gilmore was with the Cowboys... they never were together ona stacked team. They were never teammates.  But that's how it is with Dallas, people just make up stuff and they keep going like he told the truth. For example, Dak is interception prone, another lie. Dak had one season of high interceptions and that was when Jerry traded his #1 Amari before Ceedee was ready to be the guy, and he broke his hand in the very first game of the same season. Oh and Btw, its the Eagles who are finally winning after years of signing "dream team" after "dream team" and still losing. Dream team were their words not mine. Dallas has always built through the draft. Jerry is an ex offensive ljneman himself,  and they always build offensive lines. They'd add 1 player here and there but never a group of free agent players. Its usually a trade. If you hate Dallas thats fine, but at least tell the truth.
Suddenly dark will be praised again mark my words
Achos two face happy now for them boys 😂😂….it explains why you where always a reserve
Dallas better hope this gamble leads to immediate success, cause if it dont, its a one year rental and a lost 3rd round draft pick
Tyler Smith, Tyler Booker, Tyler Guyton (nope).... Cooper Beebee yeah
Shady is a certified Cowboys hater.... Quit asking his b**** a** anything Dallas related
Pickens is a head case waiting to explode.
Jerry Jones is an idiot owner and everything said about him as an owner is true. I cannot stand Shady. He has 2 rings and wasn't instrumental in either. He pops a lot of s*** and when he played w/ his beloved Eagles and never won s***.
1:16 eagles
Yeah we'll make it to the playoffs all right when daks contract is Up DC4L
I agree with Shady. Dak is a really good quarterback......in the regular season, but turn the lights on, when its win or go home he has not proven worthy of those moments. He has a lot to prove this year cause the front office has given him no excuses.
Shady is lying with this great defense s*** LOL they've had good players and good to decent defenses but they haven't been able to stop the run in years. They're not even halfway good at stopping the room haven't been since the 90s.
Ya it all looks great on paper until u remember ur qb sh*** the bed in every big game lol
easy on the Pickens glaze...he has 12 touchdowns in 3 years
They don’t even bring up Turpin the all pro
Offense no where near as good as the ravens
We Dem Boyz! Three very good running backs. Javontae Williams from Denver, and the two Rookie . Drafted a Great O Line guy from Alabama! Added Pickens to help Cee Dee Lamb! Best Off-Season in a long time! When they give Dak Prescott weapons we win 13+ games you can check those facts because they are 100% true ! We winning the Dag Gone Super Bowl I Promise you that! HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS! 🤠 🐎 ⭐️
Bro talking post broken ankle dez😂
As an Eagles fan, I’m laughing so hard
Shady is exactly that. He hates the cowboys
He brings cancer to the team!
Jake Ferguson gonna have a monster season.
So sad to hear that the Dallas Cowboys just tested positive for cancer.  Love and prayers. ❤
I don't like shady but I kinda have to agree with what he's saying and I'm a cowboys fan of 50 years. Dak has to stay healthy.
Dallas can never be balanced. Not anymore.
An unequivocal NO.
It’s the same talk about the cowboys every single year.  I’m with Shady .. this move not gonna make  that big of a difference..
Cowboys still don’t have a running back?
I am curious.  How did the Cowboys afford a balanced offense with Dak making 60 mil?  How did the Eagles win the Super Bowl with Hurts making $51 mil?  Everyone is dissing on Purdy getting $50 mil plus shutting the Niners out of the Super Bowl.
what's this George Pickens "off the field" issues?
And just like clockwork the Cowboys make a trade and the talking heads crown them playoff bound and possibly Superbowl winners. They were saying the same thing when they got Amari Cooper. Every freaking year. 10:24
Repent for Jesus for he is returning soon. You might think he’s not but he is, look at this world and how it inlines with the Book of Revelations. Every thing you see in it is identical to what’s going on. I didn’t write this to strike fear but to save out you from desolation. Yes it will convict but that’s the purpose, it so you will change your ways because it does not please God, the One who create you out of His likeness and image (Genesis 1:26-31) He wants you to repent because of your sin. Its what separates you from Him, sin leads to death. He wants a relationship with you, He wants to protect you, He wants to heal you and help you grow in life. He has no intentions of harming you or wanting you to live in calamity. But you push him back everyday with your bad decisions or choices. You have to stop living for this world, not the earth but the world. Where fornication lays dormant, pride, greed, hatred, lust, jealousy, envy, mistrust, gluttony, idolatry, all types of evil. It’s everywhere, where you walk, it’s on your phone, it’s at your house, it’s surrounds you and your friends, it’s at your job. You live in it and it controls you. Your apart of that world and its why you sin. It’s a slaughterhouse and you and everyone else are sheep. Everyday you get closer and closer to that blade. You all are being manipulated and deceived. There’s no truth in this world but outside of it. In this world there’s no life but outside. To get outside this world is through Christ, the Son of God. The one who God sent down to die for all of us because of the evil things we have done. We all have done evil, no one on this earth is blameless. But the one who shred blood for us on the Cross. Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the Son of The Most High. He loved us so much that He died for our sins so that we will be made blameless in front of the Father. He died for you so you won’t have to live in that world that you live in everyday. It’s not the lifestyle we all were made to live. Over time we made corrupt lifestyles and turned our backs against God with the help of satan. We allowed satan to control us, that’s how this world came to being corrupted ; It’s inside of the world God created for us. But “if we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us ours sins and  to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” 1 John 1:9 KJV. If we repent and confess He promise that He will save us from all and everything that harms us. All you have to do is have faith and trust in Him. If you don’t trust how are you going to receive his gracious gift? Would you rather trust in this evil world we’re it’s only purpose is to destroy you or The Only True living God that’s wants to see you thrive and have an abundante life? He doesn’t want anyone to perish (reference to 2 Peter 2:9), but to have a life with him eternally. Turn, repent, have faith, believe, trust, put down your life for him and He bring you up and give you a new one. Jesus will wash you with His clean blood. He loves you too much for you to live in destruction and despair. He doesn’t want you to be in your head everyday worrying or you being confused and depressed. Nothing will provide comfort or protection nor peace nor help in this world but Jesus. You don’t need a girlfriend or boyfriend to please you or to feel “loved”. If you want to feel and know what actually love is, Jesus is all you need, “he is the only way, truth, and life”( John 14:6). He loves you dearly more than anyone❤️❤️❤️❤️
Commentators still analyze based on old fashion football. These young boys play a different game. Danny Ozarks of football. School ‘em Shady!
Shady hating as usual
Shady a clown 🤡
Jerry can't tackle
You're not talking about how Dez dropped nearly every pass his last year in Dallas, even when the ball was thrown perfectly 🤣
Dallas Sucks Perpetual losers. Haven't won in 30 years.
Its been a whole off-season and I still can't stand shady.  How does he still have a job
Cowboys going 8-9
Gaydy the biggest hater on tv.
How many wins dose Fak Trashcott has against good teams vs bad teams in the past 8yrs? He has a bad record vs good teams and definitely a worst record against back to back victories vs good teams.And guess what? In the playoffs there are only good and great teams! That's why he loses every time in the playoffs!
He is 💯% correct. As long as Fak Trashcott is the QB, come playoff time, he  crumbles every time!! Is great that they have finally gotten key positions covered but they have yet to cover the most important position which is QB!
defense wins championships...
So when we don’t make it to the playoffs it’s because Dak is gone but when we lose and he’s healthy it’s Dak fault. I don’t get it Shady
The Dak hate is so forced
The other team with alll that?? 🦅 💍 💍
Dak can't win. The defense will give up the first 3 possession for a td and it's all Dak's fault.
You can't blame Dak for the defense not stopping the ball in the playoffs
Shady always a hater
The vikings are another team
🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
What is Jerry Jones job? To give those "Talking Heads" something to Talk about.   There for Jerry has done a Great job again this year.
You guys will alternate who's the best offense btwn now and September. They get a whinning immature George lets see who gets upset first George  or cee dee
1 yr rental
Shady is just a Dak hater
Relax. If Pickens doesn’t get his numbers he will pout. Every receiver that left the Steelers has been trash. Reactionary takes aren’t great takes
Is it me, or does that Acho guy over exert unnecessary words and enthusiasm into this show? Every sentence it sounds like he's trying.. takes away from the show with those horribly long sentences and soliloquies
Balanced??? suspect at both OT, uncertainty at TE, RB1 coming off injury may not regain form, 2 new RB are untested late round picks, Miles Sanders  probably doesnt make the roster, new coach, new line coach, new play book and aging QB coming back from another injury...
The defense folded in the playoffs
Ha ha, George Pickens will nevet get seperation from the likes of Quinion Mitchell.  He be lucky to get 10 yards against the Eagles.
Let’s calm down now it’s the Cowboys lol 😅
NO.....things will be the same because of Dak as QB. Just watch and see. Dak may have gotten some great help on offense....but he will still be the downfall on offense. WE NEED A QB.
Shady take was horrible
I’ve seen the mock drafts. Next years QB class is overrated and Manning hasn’t played a full season of football yet
0:13 13 whole seconds in… Balanced? Compared to what? Because they are certainly not balanced compared to another football team. They have no run game and their defense is weak. Balanced? C’mon, Acho. That is the dumbest take you’ve ever had and that is saying something.
george Pickens is a tumor. the Cowboys are in need of chemo... lol
Ghotta give shady mc coy respect he's the only one keeping it 💯all these other guys are delusional listen to what shady is saying it's facts
shady not impressed with his partners lol!!! what are we talkin bout here!!! go birds!
To be fair cooks was already washed when he went to Dallas
Chasestradamus 😂
The lions and Eagles offense is more balanced and better. The cowboys wr duo isn’t top7. line isn’t top 10. But I guess this gets views and comments
America’s team hasn’t sniffed a Super Bowl in 32 years!  Failure much?
Can we please stop it like just because they got a wide receiver does not make them Super Bowl contenders stop it. The Cowboys are still the Cowboys stop it. Dak Prescott is still the QB stop it. The Super Bowl starts after dak actually never🤣🤣…eagles for life🦅🦅🦅
Im so tired of hearing about the Cowboys every off season, it's the same thing every year, and they still won't make the playoffs.
6-11
Chase says go get Pickens, then shots on them for it possibly being a one year rental. SMH. Minimal risk. Worst case they get a 3rd comp if he doesn’t resign or tag and trade if need be.
James Jones is talking about Dak with Dez in his first two season like he’s the same QB. He let the ball go with Michael Gallup downfield on 50/50 balls & he ate prior to tearing his ACL. Pickens is a more gifted War than Gallup. He will fit seamlessly with Dak & CeeDee. He’ll play the X like Gallup did but a better talent. Also, it’s Jonathan Mingo not Ringo.
The most balanced…. Yes the EAGLES
Oi nah shady is the guy, watching the first 2 people speak I was like nah wtf then shady comes wid da QB is the problem. hats off to you 😂😂
dumbest take ever. cowboys offense is impotent
Here we go with NFL on Dallas nutz smh. Sickening
Regular season don't matter no more nobody gaf about Dak regular season stats. Postseason
6:29 what I was saying after I heard about the trade… all they need is a QB
Normally Shady on tilt, but I agree with him on this. Dak needs to get it done in playoffs. Defense needs to help Dak too though
We keep ignoring the fact that the Steelers are the team that knows when to move on from a receiver look at their track record they always move on at the perfect time
This is our year 4 sure this time 😂
Here we go with the yearly Dallas gassing. This clown acho just said they have the best offense 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Haven’t turned in  months and I see why Dak Prescott hasn’t had anyone since Michael Gallup to throw 50-50 balls too, and when he had Michael Gallup He threw the 50-50 Fade a lot.
I like how James Jones brought up Mingo. I honestly would have been fine with him at the #2. I think Mingo had huge upside but I obviously would rather have Pickens lol.
Dak had two turnovers, a pick six and just 50 yards passing their first four drives against the Packers😂
Cowboys got all the good ingredients for a bomb dinner, BUT let's see how they cook!
It’s not all on Dak in the playoffs, everyone has to show up. They got embarrassed by the packers. Offense and defense sucked
2:50 what
Shady a hater😂😂😂😂
Their defense still sucks...
NO THEY WERE 3-5 BEFORE THAT LOSER GOT HURT
8:00 bucs slander is crazy! Bucs have won 2 superbowls in the last 30 years to cowboys 0 😂
I get it. It's preseason and hype is what it's all about. I hope Pickens helps, but I wouldn't hold my breath. The 'Boys haven't won a significant playoff game in three decades.
Bro we are talking about the dallas cowboys. This team will find ways to lose games instead of winning them.
Buccs offense better
Shady it’s different!! Dak is going to make you eat Dem Feathers!!
You see once again you always have to put so much around him. The salary camp is damn near blown up I love the wire receiver, George Pickens I get it but just like shady McCoy said Prescott has always been the problem and hopefully George Pickens don’t get frustrated because Prescott thinks he’s Tom Brady I’m just saying Tony Romo never had a offensive line to start his career so when you mention Tony Romo, it levels Tony Romo carried the Cowboys franchise Bailey having a offensive line no running back that’s what you call a quarterback and if Tony Romo had the talent that Prescott had to start his career come on man I thought you played football you played the game and you’re telling me that Prescott is a better quarterback than Tony Romo. It seems like you have not been in the film room enough lack of homework at the end of the day. I love the pick up I just wish we build around our best player Micah Cowboys for life.
Defense avg give up was 30+ 2 years ago. 4 isn’t the issue, get this goofy off tv🤦🏻‍♂️
You gotta slow down on your Yada Yada 😅
Jayden blue, just remember that name with booker leading the way, plus Pickens now to take pressure off ceedee where he can shine in the slot huge pick up snowball effect to all positions!!
10:28 James Jones W Da Clever Third Rd Picc Insider😎
Still LOSERS...# Yawn
It’s not even Dak yeah he is the leader, but the cowboys defense is hot garbage lol. No run game for sheeee….
Just my opinion but he'll be the #1 wr CD sucks and runs the wrong routes and drops passes when we need him to catch them.
This is the worse nfl analyst show of them ALL!! Easily
Balanced offense?...  if balanced means throwing the ball 45 times a game!!!  These clowns say anything
Don’t mention the fact dak don’t got run game haven’t had it in years plus the defense gets shredded when it’s time to stop the run stop it shady
Dak Prescott can't even count on Daniel Jones  W. Giants loaded with brand new roster and Jaxson Dart , Abdul Carter, Nabers, , Javon Holland, Chauncey Goldstone lol.
12 W  team with Pickens 😂 . Shady is bringing sanity in this laughable debate.
5:03 no. You act up when you know your QBs are trash
5:03 no. You act up when you know your QBs are trash
Some time I wonder if Dak smashed shady’s girl. This dude hates Dak for no reason 🤦🏿‍♂️
3:40 i bet Shady gonna use this as his moment to hate on Dak. I can see the Hate stirring in his lik besdy eyes😂😂
Just here to hear how 1 of y'all start hating..thay draft was GENIUS. Pickens over Golden ANYDAY
Another bs biased shady. I swear soon as Dallas is brought up the camera goes right to his face. Its corny. I'm not even a dallas fan but damn bro is corny af. Your supposed to be non biased not cringed high-school takes. When are you guys going to get rid of 🐢
He just explained the eagles
The boys aint going win nothing with dak he aint elite
Lmao looks good on paper but why did the steelers got rid of him good lucks cowboys 🤠😅
Facts bro i aint worried bout the line def or rungame and D4k will be top 5 💯
No. Broken franchise from top down.
This dude Chase racist he always on some B's with black players that's why  we got rid of you from Chicago u bum
Dak will probably gat injured, if he doesn't have a good run offense. The defenses in the NFL require All Pro guards, especially for the running game,  which translates to pass protection.
Leave it to shady to let them know  the truth, there is no more excuses for Dak now.
Shady just be lying acting like we didn’t have coaching problems defense couldn’t stop the run
The Eagles do not have a player better than Micah Parsons on their team. The path to the Super Bowl is through Philly and Micah is the only guy who can lead them there
Shady ain’t lying. Tired of the letdown since the first year Dak’s been in the league. Had fresh zeke and we still couldn’t get past the first game in the playoffs.
oh my God Shady is the worst. He knows nothing what a clown
This is enough to make the Cowboys good. But not great. Which is kind of how they've been since a long time ago.
George Pickens is in a contract year and if the cowboys don’t give him a new deal he’s going to quit on them just like he did to the Steelers.
Dak gets hurt before playoffs Milton steps up superbowl
People act like Dallas didn’t have a man named dez Bryant who was a huge issue at times and we still made that happen
All hype
im a die hard cowboy fan. i hate dak with all my heart. i pray that they give that kid from the patriots a chance as soon as dal stsrts to stink it up. we have everything else lined up.
Enjoy the headaches Dalllas, you knew what you were getting into.
Horrible horrible decision by the Cowboys. I’m so glad the Chargers opted to not try for this guy. He’s nothing but a poison pill.   His work ethic will be his downfall.
I am so sick and tired of the cowboys every time they do something it has to be the number one conversation who cares
Acho is a crackhead
Acting like Dak won't throw 50/50 balls like if Gallup didn't exist is crazy
Now they need a good quarterback.   Dak has tunnel vision.  He can't see the hold field.
Just need a decent linebacker & d line to stop the run
McCoy is a hater 😂
Another video hyping up the Dallas Cowboys. We all know we will disappoint in the end.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Every WR that goes on the Podcast with Shady gets traded.  He hypes them up thinking they're better than what they are.
We can't be the most I hate to say it but eagles are the champs and they mostly all still there , Detroit still hasn't the best o line I'm the NFL and the AFC still has the MVP QB  carrasle
You can smell see the fear all over Shady’s demeanor and body language 🤣🤣🤣🤣 He hate Dak so bad and swears Hurts is better than Dak and light years ahead of Purdy 🤦🏿‍♂️. He’s so scared Dak Prescott has a chance to win succeed and expose his QB for the fraud he really is. Hurts so carried by the Eagles and it doesn’t take a blind man to see it
Shady ofc going feelings over facts. Cowboys got a lot better and this will open up the offense. The Cowboys offense is scary
Can yall have a segment on next years qb class???
You forget that Dallas had a lot of injuries last year and you need to look at the record dak has a better record against Hurts
Dallas will be judged by the post season
Cowboys fan but I hate saying it.... shady is 100% right
They had the BEST o line in the NFL for years!!!!! And WHAT? NOTHING! ADD WHO THEY WANT! WON'T WIN UNTIL THEY SUBTRACT DAK!!!!!
Bad trade for cowboy geoge is the next AB a diva there a problem is coming to the cowboy
Get shadure
Coaching and defense needs to be held more accountable for falling short every year instead of bashing Dak
The most balanced offense. LMFAO 😂. They are NOT more balanced or better than the Eagles or Lions or Rams or Ravens or Bills or Commanders. Stop it
Seen dude in the comments say ain’t no it worried about the cowboys run game and defense… it’s true in a way because one you can run the ball you can beat the Cowboys right…. Let’s see how this year looks. I hope you know with the exception of last season the Cowboys lead the league in take away and we’re #1 in INTs, Top 5 in sacks and #1 in turnovers for 3 straight years.   If they can learn to stop the run it’ll be a wrap for teams. Them dudes had a top 5 scoring offense with a mediocre offense missing a lot of pieces.   Let’s see how they look this year if healthy. The like is better, they have a legit #2, New, young talented running backs and they tired their best to address the run defense in the draft so we’ll see wassup. If you know football you wouldn’t hate on these facts
shady is as wide as he is tall
shady was a mediocre rb, why is he even on this platform?
the steelers essentially swapped a 6th for a 5th to trade Pickens, they would have gotten a 3rd round comp pick for Pickens if they didnt want to resign him. why didnt nobody mention this? Steelers got fleeced, badly. very smart move by the Cowboys. You gave away a 3rd for a 1 year rental, but same thing, you get that 3rd back when he walks in free agency. we'll see how it works out on the field
lmao cowboys will fail again
it was a catch!
"My Cowboys are about to have the best 8 - 9, at best 9 - 8 season in history."
Pickens is overrated
Let me know when cowboys defense can stop the run which is their biggest weakness
Dez bryant stats in 2010, 2011, 2015 below 900 yards
I hate shady but he's right about Dak!
6:21 that o-line statement is not entirely true. It may appear that it is, but it's actually yet to be seen.   I predict Shady's statement is false.   Again, it's yet to be seen.
The disrespect towards Brandon cooks is wild!
Put chase eoll criticize Jalen hurts
Next
Lol this move aint going to do nothing!! Do they have tom brady? Can they stop the run , u can keep there offense off the field by just running the ball 😂😂😂  can they stop the run
THE EAGLES 🦅 🦅
Oh So now They are Going to the Super Bowl!!????
Here we go 😂😂😂 they going to the superbowl again
Cowboys go 6 wins on the season
Dak is they issue
Shady speaking facts 🗣️
No, they are NOT.  They still identify as she/they.
Shady definitely got a female that got hit by Dak and he hates him for it. I’m convinced at this point cuz bro stay hating 😂
Well now the Cowboys have good receivers on Lamb and the new reciver, now they need a very  good QB.
The eagles are a better team
You say they have a running game,a balanced offense.ummmmmm I digress
I don’t want him 😡😡 it won’t matter anyway DAK is shity
I don’t want him 😡😡
acho smoking fet!!!😂😂😂😂
shady  is right. cowboys had a explosive offense like philly and fell short. philly since has won the superbowl and a rookie made it to the nfc championship game.
If he don't act a fool
Pickens has flaws there were a number of corners locked him down last season.
The Cowgirls will continue to be the jokes of the NFL...and won't make the playoffs or win a Super Bowl
Don't make me laugh 😅😅 the Cowgirls will suck this season as usual
Soooo this is a 1 year deal basically Pittsburgh won that trade …. They can’t pay him
Shady is a hater
Already glazing these MFS couldn't wait 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🦅🏈💪🦅🏈💪
eagles offense is better in my opinion
Every year.  Same BS for Cowboys.  Lol. Stop it!
How does McCoy have a job ?
These people are beyond delusional.  Cowboys will finish last in the division and Pickens will create drama by game 4.
Dak I hope you watching this!
Lmao he about to crash out on Dak 😂
😂😂😂
Shady really let me down here. Can't believe he let acho get away with that statement (name a team that is more balanced than this?) lol there's a team that just won the sb in the same division buddy. Way more proven, balanced offense
Who’s Them Boys QB again?? 😂😅😂
Shady a clown he stay hating
One of the best things going into this year is lack of tape on their new offense and new defense
I stopped listening for a while to you guys, but I thought I tune in and see what you guys thought about George Pickett coming to the Cowboys and y’all still hating on that man we tired of hearing that talk real football
Cowboys will have a terrific regular season.  ..go Dak.
So it’s Dak fault that the defense gives up the most yds against top tier teams then anybody in the league, it’s Dak fault that receivers can’t get open because of the scheme of the offense, we only cede and no else that year that we had a chance was 2023 when we had a good enough team to go the distance but what happen that year oh the defense give up yardage against a top tier team oh it’s was the packers and who did we have that yr , micha , Dlaw , Jlew , diggs , dbland and Stephon Gilmore and our coach was Dan Quinn who was suppose to be the best defensive coach in the league but give that game away. So I don’t wanna hear “oh it’s Dak fault they lost in playoff narrative” because from what heard it’s a whole team game not one person
Lamb in the slot ...Mingo and Pickens out wide🔥🔥🔥
Dak had Gallup,Cooper and Lamb lmao and still sucked
Still the cowboys, well have to wait and see
I still ain't got ova them passing on henry
You're describing the eagles and the lions offenses. Cowboys had one of the worst run games in the league whose calling the offense in Dallas? 8 wins otw
Watch Pickens hold out this yr for that contract lol
Heck to the Naw, Naw, Naw! They haven't proven that they're capable of running the ball or stopping the run *_consistently,_* which means they'd have to pass the ball 50 times a game, and that's a *_losing_* formula. Plus, even when they had good teams, they hadn't won a divisional playoff game in thirty-years. The question should be ARE THE cowboys NOW THEM BAMAS? YES!! 🤠🙄
Yeah this show needs shady, the rest of them just say what they think people want to here 😂
Get nothing if he signs for 30m that's a comp pick
All of daks losses in the playoffs the defense gave up 30+ points each time, no qb has a winning record in the playoffs when their defense gives up 30+....
I agree with shady, as non-delusional cowboys die hard, Dak is the problem. He's always had help. We need a new QB
As a cowboys shady is 100 percent correct. Hopefully Milton start soon.
Rookie RB Blue will make ton of noise this year.
This fool hates on dak so much when he sucked so much he won super bowl as a bench player
Steelers fan. Was a fan of Pickens and still am but I have a feeling he was becoming a diva so he should fit in with the cowboys.
Lol, so Dak is the 3rd best qb in the NFC East, and yall still think Dallas is gonna do something.  😂
Cowboys got … Kenneth Murray from titans (mlb) Drafted DLine … defense will be ready
Guyton isn’t going to a Pro Bowl lol .
Yo we got Turpin to
6:40 facts
This is a terrible move cowboys aint making the playoffs again
Cowboys ain’t done nothing since the 90’s we getting close to 2030
Shady absolutely hate Dak, I have been a Cowboys fan my entire life and I have seen every playoff game since 1976 and those losses were not all on Dak. The entire offense looked horrible in those losses. But according to Shady it's Dak. If you're receiving core can't get open then how can Dak produce at a high level and there isn't many QBs that can period
We sound good on paper. Let's see
Cowboys suck and are cursed, jeery will find a way to make great players mediocre
This tells me that they are done with Aaron Rodgers. Gonna take their lumps and focus on the 2026 draft.
Shady is a Hater.  Pickens is better than Gallup and probably Amari and definately better than everything else there not counting what the rookies might show. The lineman are going to be better.  What is still a question is the Defense.  If the Defense stop the run the Cowboys will win 11 or 12 games.  The run game gotta be there too.  When Dak went 13-3 his rookie year, the defense lost the playoff games more than Dak did.
the steelers know when to get rid of Wrs. This will not go well for dallas.
Shady be hatin…he know dem Boyz bout to be a problem. As soon as we win the division…hating gonna turn up
I'm a Cowboys fan and if he can't run 5yrd routes then he's no good for dak
I see they listen to me and change the aesthetic of their desk
The bowl isn't won because you made a trade in the off season. So when and if they get to bowl then speak until then 😂😂😂
This video is hilarious. Absolutely no one is worried about the cowboys.  When they go 8-9 and in 3rd place we’ll see how dem boys do.
Shady always with the best take 💯
Shady has a losing record against Dak 😂 Dak has owned the East since he started in Dallas Dak is 60-40 against the NFC East
Still go be eagles commanders an idk between cowboys n giants
I think shady mad about how much money dak makes because he’s always talking about that man money
I want to ask LeSean McCoy does the team the Cowboys play in the playoffs matter are the 49ers and the Green Bay Packers the two playoff wins at Prescott does have was against the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay that's a question I think that somebody's guys should have asked who Prescott and the Cowboys play in the playoffs matter
As an Eagles fans I look forward to the sideline antics when Pickens (the guy who complains about not getting the ball enough as a WR1) yells at Dak cuz he isn't throwing to him enough as WR2. Jerruh really knows how to build a team for drama and ticket sales!
Cee dee and PG cowdrama good luck dak arm a rubberband
Only thing I would say about the Cowboys and their 12 win seasons recently,  NFC East has been a dumpster fire for years.  Now we’re throwing the Commanders in the 2 slot, after the Eagles.  Cowboys aren’t in the same 1 or 2 position as they were recently.  The East, in general, is stepping up their game.    Cowboys have to do something.  They’re trying.    And at the end of the day. Dak is in his 30s.  You have a short window with a good QB(not great-est).  But they’re trying.  And as I’m watching this, I agree with JJ. I’m still confused as to why Dez dropped off so hard but I think Dak hurt his game and the media hurt Dez so much he couldn’t even get on a team for a minute.  But, with Tony….and the catch that should have been….they almost kicked that monkey and made the NFC conference game.  Dez was a beast then and Tony played to Dez’s strengths.   Not protecting the ball and managing his own.  He knew what he had and they threw it up.  Miss those plays.
1:35 eagles, lions, packers and the commanders
The sing about the other teams that LeSean McCoy just mentioned there's some differences the first one being the Jaguars and Falcons have never once won a Superbowl in their existence and the Buccaneers and Saints haven't won a Super Bowl since their Star Quarterback to left then you have to factor in none of those things I had three 12 and 5 Seasons and they play in small markets so once again to sum it up what's the Dallas Cowboys it's super bowl or bust versus any of these other teams make it gray area in wiggle room and for some of these teams that LeSean McCoy mentioned for those teams the regular season matters those teams don't always shoot for Super Bowls
Now Go Get Amari.
shady talking reminded me why i dont watch this show lol Respectfully, but not my cup of tea
Cowboys fan for life shady makes some good points, but not all playoffs losses were on Dak. Look at Lamar Jackson. How many drops in the playoffs from receivers or defense or special teams total team game...
Shady lecoy just being a hater
Can't believe Im saying this but I agree with Shady. this is a big move but Dak has shown time and time again no matter how much talent he has around him. he will underperform. I hope that changes this year.
Pickens is going to more of a locker room problem than an on the field problem.
What's w are they now? They have always been them same old cowboys for 30 years.
What a Hater
I agree with most the Dak talk. But he let the ball go for MG13. He had a couple 1000 yard seasons
Dallas is garbage
Guess the Steelers found the Pirates strategy book lying around some back alley. Fk you Mike T; GP was worth more than our coaching staff and owners.
It's  a Team GAME !!!
Go birds..cowgirls aint doing nothing to eagles secondary
PLEASE Cowboys are bottom  feeders 😂😂😂  best thing about the cowboys is the cowgirls....  one guy Pickens  automatically  saves  them😂😂😂😂 these guys are jokes.  Maybe they are betrer then Giants that's  literally it... Commanders  anf eagles own that division
They say this BS every year 🙄
Delusional
Great move
Ain’t no one scared 😂
McCoy is a hater 😂
Dak for 9 games then back up QB the rest. Good luck
Opinions are like A holes,everyone has one😂
They've had great teams in the past and did nothing, what's different now?
Slow day fr
Bro these HOSTS DONT KNOW WHAT THEY TALKING ABOUT. Why are they getting paid to talk nonsense out their mouth? Jesus Christ they are idiots lmao
Bengals idiot
Shady comparing Cooks to Pickens  Major 🤡
McCoy is a generational hater , imagine comparing 30 year old Cooks to Pickens….
Shady been a grade A hater since day 1 F that dude
So basically the Cowboys under a best case scenario in three years are like the Eagles only lesser in every regard.
Shady be hating
How about them Cowboys 🏉
Shady 🎯💯🎯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
I despised shady McCoy  when he was actively playing.I love his side of this&enjoy hes comments.Dude was a baller
Lmfao mfr said cooks like if pickens isnt a massive upgrade tha cooks
Shady is a loudmouth cuck.
I did hear jones  call mingo …Ringo….lol
Hard to listen to Shady just complain about Dak? Game planning versus teams in playoffs have been disastrous!
Big facts! Dak will loose with talent around him or without  It’s proven. Facts are facts!
Most balanced? You forget that you have no RB?
Man I'm sick dam 😢 Steelernation
turtle man is such a Cowboys hater
I can hear it already..... "THIS IS OUR YEAR" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If it's not KC or Philly shady gone talk down!!!
I wanna be mad at shady but I can't be. He's right. 4 drops the ball alot. BUT I do think 4 can get it done sooner or later
Here we go! One trade and Dallas is going all the way. Wtf every year the hype train is a joke.
Shady is forgetting in last 2 playoff losses the defense absolutely folded in those games. Im not saying dak is an all time but lets not act like hes the only one who folded in those games
When your def has to double team the receivers it leaves ur run game open to smash
Lmao not making the playoffs will be us not surprising at all
I think the coaching staff at Pittsburg has to do with the move more than Pickens tj what wants to move around too so def coaching staff
acho be making no sense .. like they have no run game … but have a balanced offense ???
Shady is a hater get on my damn nerves. Dallas hated by many going to get there respect by alll.
I wonder what/who Daks idiotic supporters will blame when the scrub chokes PER USUAL...😂...i swear Dak apologists are the most ignorant people in sports
Dez Bryant had the same attitude as Pickens lol Dallas deals with them types
Ringo!?
If philly can pay Hurts AJ Smith and Barkley... we can afford Pickens when his contract is up
Hey Acho, the Eagles have everything you asked about, and 2 super bowls in the last 8 years
One more move to make JJ, trade #4 and bring in a top QB in the league
They should be with the addition of Tyler and Jaydon the video of Jaydon speaks for itself
Dude didn't elevate Pittsburgh what makes them think Dallas is gonna be different. Dallas won't make the playoffs
The biggest problem:  JERRY JONES  THIS TEAM WILL BE IN PLAYOFF PURGATORY TILL OL' JERRY IS 6 FEET UNDER !! We can only hope his idiotic son sells the team.
lol with wat rb thou
Shady a clown 🤡 if not for Barkley yall lose to the bucs in the playoffs again
Pickens is getting the best QB he has probably ever had.
Is he talking about the Detroit Lions or the Cowboys? It most definitely sounds like the lions to me🤷🏾‍♂️
What bozos yall selling wolf tickets ….. cowboys are garbage they need to rebuild,,,, the guys they have is not the answer u ain’t fooling me !
“A 3rd down receiving back in Miles Sanders “….This 🥷must haven’t watched Miles play🤦🏾‍♂️
Dem girls
Mike T's inability to keep his WRs in line/focused needs to be studied (AB, Juju, Claypool, Diontae, Pickens). ...Give him grace on AB tho.
McCoy right, it's on 4, period.
Cowboys Super Bowl now right? 😅
Alot of times going to another team solves a lot of issues. He may see himself as a #1 but CD is the man and even he knows this. He's ona team w stars now ...not like the QB carousel in Pittsburgh
Shady’s hairline😂😂😂😂 Diabolical
Once agin shady is full of shhhh!! Dallas always cant run the ball or stop the run in the playoffs!!! Way unballanced, Dak hasnt had a good WR 2 like Pick, Dak was to young with Dez to play like he does today
It’s starting to be a trend with Steelers getting rid of players in there prime for a bum
Like usual, McCoy never knows wtf he's talkin about.  All he does is continue to blame Dak for everything while twisting the narrative
We ain't got NO RUNNING GAME
I mean I’m a cowboys fan and I love the trade, but I love that shady keeps it a buck on Dak…cuz he ain’t lying.   2016 team was completely stacked he threw 2 picks out us in hole.. we’ve seen that story again again and again.
It's still "the Boys" playing a men's game, until they show up "as men" and play the game.
Agree with Shady. Dak needs to play better
this guy is delusional.. cowboys have no run game how are they balanced. buccaneers offense is balanced
Bruh. As soon as he said tyler guyton as an all pro in 2 years I was like this dude don't watch cowboys football😂
Did they get a running game that we don't know about. I can name many teams that are way more balanced. That's the dumbest hot take
Get rid of the coach and general manager they got to go are draft pick suck are coach sucks are general manager sucks straight trash
Bad coaching bad defense in playoffs
Nah. Cowboys inherited a problem and drama.
Come on Acho… you played for a team that is a much more balanced offense than Dallas… Philly is way more balanced than the cowboys are with Saquon, AJ, Smitty, Goedert, and one of the best O-Line’s in the league, with a QB that wins
He is a one year rental — they can’t afford to pay him what he wants.
Dak had like 9 touchdowns and 8 picks before he got hurt last year.   Its a really good move, nobody is scared of their running backs, and their offensive line is average at best. They are "assuming" they are gonna get better. Guyton was terrible last season.
Shady a hypocrite man his boy Josh Allen been coming up short in playoffs dak or Allen never been to a superbowl or got rings do your homework Shady
Another Steelers draft letdown. Maybe, this year will be different!?
Paper doesn't win anything but a paper cut!!! Facts!!!
They will be the same old cowgirl as they always been😂😂😂
This show is horrible!
Steelers got rid of him .hmmmmmmmm😂
Is the thing that kills me about you guys as a cowboy fan you guys love to do this kind of stuff first you'll say that's the problem but is that really a problem
Don’t forget kevonte Turpin is now moving into the offseason and he’s incredibly speedy they are gonna be taking the top off of offenses it’s gonna be completely impossible to stop the run because you got fast and speedy receivers
Still going 8-8 😂😂😂😂
Why are they telling them lies!
Cowboys oline is stout?
Acho says the dumbest most obvious nonsense everytime
😂😂😂"one of if not THE most balanced offenses in football". My God people are desperate to talk good about the Cowboys. Great cause now when they yet again fail they'll be no talk of "they don't have any weapons".
So is Dak good or nah?
Jerry Jones is making 🇺🇸🇺🇸 team great again! Let’s go! We them boyz‼️
Cowboy’s sucks with or without George Pickens it doesn’t make a different they still suck.
Shady usually has some bad takes but I’ll have to admit, he’s is 1000% right. It’s all about #4, and it’s coming from a Cowboys fan. Dak has been in the league too long and has to many good great rosters. Excuses need to end. He’s got the top spot making the top money, it’s now or never for him
I’m taking all bets for when a crash out against dak prescott happens
If you don't stop it,they aren't a balance nothing but, a bunch of never will bee's 😂😂😂
Not completely disagreeing w/ Shady but I think he always seems to hate on Dallas
Dez was bout done when Dak had him James.
They can’t stop a NOSE BLEED on defense. Also DAK can’t win in the playoffs
Why not use him to move up in the draft to get something u need... unbelievable
Shady a hater to his heart when it comes to Dallas and Dak. Straight hater.
The falcons
What about Phil Mafah?
But can we stop the run?
And the cycle begins again.
GP gone crash out when DK don’t throw him the ball 🤣
Shady shaking in his boots he know his Sheagles gonna be in trouble 😂😂😂
When it's not about Eagles, he's disinterested. Shady, they got better point blank.
Dallas needs to definitely use the fact they have 3 Tylers on the oline as some sort of promo. Maybe called. Meet the Tylers and its just a comp of them dominating the line😂
Fact shady
REDSKINS COMMANDERS!
We need to give Joe Milton a good amount of snaps this pre season since there’s so much doubt around Dak, get him comfortable and allocated early in case there’s a fall of with #4.
They didn’t lose all the playoff games because of DAK. keep it real. Who dropped balls. What the coach did. It wasn’t all just DAK
george even run routes? or just gos?
Does not change nothing.steelers got rid of a problem.dude got problems😂😂😂
He don’t throw 50/50 balls because he hasnt had that deep threat
Do they actually pay shady for his garbage
It’s ONE guy…y’all(Cowboys Fans) acting like they got 11 superstars!!🤣😆😂
Thank you for saying it Shady and I’m a cowboys fan 😅
The Eagles still significantly better position by position this isn’t a debate.
I don’t like to say this, but 25 is right.
😒the Eagles receivers ‼️‼️
Shady is such a hypocrite. Hurts was trash until you surrounded him with great receivers and he still couldn’t win the Super Bowl. Then you stacked the defense and added Barkley to the roster and he’s only the top running back in the league. Hurts can’t win with a great player at every position so stop hating because the Cowboys are giving Dak a better cast of players. We still need a couple more but today we are better.
You can't control the clock if you can't run or stop the run.
caus pik prescott is not a  playoff Qb😮 9-7 yall seas 7-10 las seas 1 more n 7-11 😂😂😂name of east cost store... 😂😂😂 they say everything big in texas... them  L's at at&t  😂😂😂
Bunch of nothing.  1st commentator was glazing.
James Jones is right about Dak. He hates throwing the 50/50 ball. Hopefully he gets more comfortable throwing it.
My Lions has the same offense lowkey
But still don't have a good qb
No it doesn't you speds
I wouldn't want Pickens for free. He's got a terrible attitude and gives up on PlayStation when things aren't going his way
LISTEN,  SHADY ALWAYS HATING ON THE COWBOYS,  HE GOT SUPER BOWL RING , AN IF IM NOT  MISTAKEN,  HE ROAD THE BENCH  YEAH HE DIDN'T EVEN PLAY IN THE GAME,  SO STOP HATING BENCH  WARMER ,PEACE
All this just for the Cowboys to go 8-9
Bravo, James. Bravo.
Ceedee at Slot with the speed, Pickens and Tolbert on the outside since they can both contest 50/50 jump balls.
If he can make that much noise in Pittsburgh. Imagine when he gets to Dallas , where everything is magnetized . Dak gone be able to give him and Lamb the ball ?
10 wins is dream that won’t come true; 3-3 in division BEST CASE, Chiefs, Lions, Vikings Packers are all losses. If they beat the worst teams in the league maybe 10. But won’t hold up.
The MOST balanced!? Lmaoo this show is such a joke. Gonna be hilarious when they do nothing, again.
One team been had all that 😂🦅
Look at the QB in Pittsburgh lol😂😂 stop hating
All I see is another prisoner at QUINYONIMO BAY!!!
7 can see the Eagles trading Dotson to the Steelers for a 3rd and a 5th in next years draft. Or more realistically a 3rd in 2026 & 6th or a 7th in 2027.
shady b spitting facts 😂😂🔥!
We will see hater's
How you going to have a balanced offense and not have a tight end?
1:17 Acho proceeds to describe the Eagles and Commanders. Who BTW have proven THEY have QBs who can get their team to an NFCCG/SB.
At the end of the day. ELIMINATED
😂😂 the cowboys the cowboys 😂😂😂
Of course shady hating he's a eagle
Shady but is so right
Who’s your qb still? 😂
As a cowboys fan of 50  plus yrs . If the cowboys make the playoffs DAK WILL CHOKE AS USUAL. ALSO DAK THROWS PICKS IN THE DAMN PLAYOFFS EVERTIME DAK PLAYS A TEAM WITH WINNING RECORD HE CHOKES.  NOTHING WILL CHANGE
And shady not wanting to talk about the regular season is so stupid. So since we haven’t won in the playoffs means it shouldn’t matter if we win during the season? Stupid lol
The most balanced offense in football? What kind of drugs is Acho taking all the time?
Penalties matter
Wild. Steelers get rid of headcase wideouts for a reason… Mike Wallace, chase claypool, Dionte Johnson and AB.. stop it Pickens does nothing
Balance requires a run game😂😂😂
....lol... Shady dont want any News from Dallas competition.  Wont look at the facts,  it's new year and basically new team.  The dial has been re-set for 25'.   Every good baseball hitter, takes any opportunity to hit the ball.  It could be a walk, single, double or HR.   That's case in point. Dallas will have opportunity to bat the ball.
Let's see what they ended up last year that's where they starting at this year the bottom they got to come prove it fly eagles fly
The eagles have all that and better at every position on offense compared to cowboys
800yds n 3tds in each of his first 3 seasons that not great yall need to stop it he good but not great stop
I’m with shady
This will not age well
Great defense? Before injuries maybe. We didn't have line backers vs green bay. We are way better off now, all helping Dak
Bengals got best wideouts in league a good tight end in Mike gecski a dual threat in chase brown
Pickens is the most over rated wr in the league
Now go get Nick Chubb, Veteran
Chase needs to quit you never was nothing
Dak makes players better...what are we talking about!   Randall Cobb Allan Hurns  Amari Cooper Cedric Wilson   Plus many more even TY Hilton  They all got their biggest bags after playing with Dak  The rhetoric is exactly false...these are all false storylines on his name for ppl like the childish odiot Shady get HIS bag too
Did he say ringo 😂
😂😂😂
Until Dallas gets a better JANUARY-built QUARTERBACK, I have NO FEAR of any kind whatsoever when it comes to the Cowboys...🙅🙅PERIOD.💪🦅🦅
Lord they bringing up an old dez that was a one trick pony
Diggs or parsons might be out of here
As much as I hate shady , I’m a Dallas fan and I agree with him. It’s all on D4K
steelers should of not traded Pickens he could of really went off with Metcalf now cowboys will get some great use out of him
Them boys😂😂😂😂. I guess you guys will probably have coach of the year too😂😂😂 another good addition. Laughing stock
Shady’s source is his ego
Pickens is AB Jr locker room cancer
How bout we see what the run game and defense has to offer before we start with that BS😂😂😂
Good trade Steelers get more draft picks for the future. To help build the team.
the point about Dak not throwing unless the WR is WIDE open, that it right there. this is KEY.
Since when is sanders a receiving back?
People don’t understand what shady is talking about Dak Prescott is a great quarterback during the regular season. The playoffs is when he has issues so with that being said, take the word regular and emphasize it that is who that is he is a regular dude regular season regular guy. Great guy can get you 12 wins come playoff time regular has to go up a notch. He has not been able to go up a notchso I agree with Shady. He will always be a 12 guy which equates to regular.
Welp I’m a ravens fan shi just keeps getting easier I will say bengals are definitely 2nd best in the division now  without debate
With what Running back? And what left tackle? The rookie hasn’t even taken a snap at RG yet….do we just print Yellow Jackets cause of paper these days??? Give me a break.
Ain’t nothing compared to Bengals offense. Nobody’s worried about Dallas as long as Dak is QB
Need a RB🏈
I guess Dak was out there playing defense. I guess he was out there & couldn’t stop the other team from scoring 30 points. Shady is a Dak4 hater all day everyday
Pickens is a bum
Shaddy is right this won't change the outcome of the Cowboys but let the Cowboys fans tell it they going to the Super Bowl😂
On Sunday’s the Cowboys will  sound like a Vietnamese Dish Dak Lamb Pickens
I feel like we seen these takes before. LmaO. 🤣.
If Pickens character isn't an issue moving forward. This is a lopsided trade for Dallas.  Steelers are gonna bring in Rodgers who isn't good or cares about football anymore and they trade their best weapon and pay 150 for DK who is a good player but never has been a true 1 and not as good as Pickens anyway
😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Blah!  Blah!  GO BIRDS!!!!!🦅
If we can get Von Miller I'll be a fan again
I think you need a running back to be balanced
Long as they have Dak they gonna suck
I agree with Shady
1/17 intelligence is not here
Steelers definitely not making playoffs
You said name it, I say The Buccaneers
NFC East is the best division this year!!!! Hands Down!!! Yeahh!!
Bad idea man. Ugh.   He’s gonna cause a lot of locker room issues
Shady was not the starter on any of those super bowl teams he was on really didn't even contribute at all I'm just saying shady not a HOF he was ok on the field never ran for 2000 not sure if he ever lead the league in rushing no OPOY vick Brady and mahomboy were his QB I mean shady let it go any other platforms would not let you get away with calling your self a champion lol you the nick young of the show lol but Nick way more funnier than you and his personality is through the roof 💯
“The most balanced offense”  Why are we acting like the eagles offense doesn’t exist anymore
By October, theyll be saying “Dak doesn’t have the weapons needed to make the playoffs”. 😴
I’m a Cowboys fan and I have to say he’s not lying about Dak.
9:11 we are doe it says “how big of a deal is Pickens trade to cowboys “
Come on Shady stop being such a friggin hater.
Tell me how many wins Hurts would have had without his RB.
I'm sure without Barkley,  jalen hurts is pretty mediocre as well....without a running game, Jalen hurts is average at best but Shady won't admit that
Dak is not the only qb we have milton too
This Men no good for sports will cry when cowboys will not be  good
McCoy building his Media career being a Cowboy hater..no original takes just a large dose of Hatoraid..
Stop blaming everything on #4, when the defense is giving up 250+ yards on the ground...
Let’s just state the facts, Dak needs good players to make him look good, Tom Brady made those around him better.
Action speaks louder than words all I'm saying
What did shady do in the playoffs?
Dak done bust shady ol lady or something lol
New year. NEW COWBOYS
2025 Superbowl Dallas Cowboys vs Buffalo Bills 34-17
been a cowboy since the 70s............ Dak isnt it
Pickens is perfect as Dallas needs a receiver but can shotty put this all together and keep the personality issues from getting out of hand I wish him great success in his career.
If it’s all on #4, the Cowboys are out of playoff contention already
Shady is always going to be a hater It's his name for Christ sakes lol You going to hold on to a Rushing title only reason you have super bowl ring was being on the bench for the Chiefs lol But then you want to cry because Jalen hurt is trash and the team carried him He's not even close to dak level as qb
How are they going to pay him next year
Shady come on bro. Give the Cowboys credit. LET'S GO # FO/4. SHADY DAK GONNA HIT YOU IN YO MOUTH THIS YEAR.
balanced offense with who at rb again?
Shady biggest hypocrite lmao Jalen hurts did it Al by himself in the post season huh? 😂
The defense two years ago was trash against the run and everyone knew it but Shady up here acting like it was the Steel Curtain defense.  Trying to pin all the post season failures on Dak is nonsense.
lmao they can't run the ball
He need to wear that 88 I got the vision
6:34 this man stay hating
Seahawks are still better
They are not all getting the ball and staying healthy……
thats exactly what we want..under the radar no 1 worried about us..perfect...
Everything said here about Dak is 100% correct. Dak does not throw 50/50 balls. He doesn't even throw back shoulder balls. Dak is the problem. Cooper Rush actually outplayed Dak last year. Cooper throws 50/50 balls. Dak is and always has been a scared QB.
Pickens is about to cause chaos there, when CeeDee gets the majority of the ball! The guy gives up blocks and has tantrums as it is.
GO BIRDS!!!
1:31 The LA Rams
Patrick Crayton, Terry Glenn, Terrance Williams, Miles Austin, Micheal Gallup basically when the cowboys have an decent 2nd option they can make something happen
Look at shady....he loves discussing Dallas...love having the D in his mouth
As a cowboys fan at this point i have to sgree with shady. Cowboys been a REGULAR season team and fold in the playoffs. They could go 17-0 in the regular season and lose the first playoff game. Would anybody care about that 17-0 ?
@shady mccoy is the worst on tv. Smh and one of the most overrated players ever.  Smh ceedee drops balls. Cowboys trash without Dak. @thefacility
Good move for Dallas,long as cooler heads prevail when things arent going right .Think Pickens should mature and  grow the older he gets . Nfc East should be fun 😤
Defense wins championships 😮😮😮
LOL, here we go again with the Cowboys lol
They picked up 1 player and now they are one of if not the most balanced team. SHUT UP
Chase took this round, I'll give him that
I don't respect the white boy on this show at all🤡
Are they better than the Eagles now? No Are they better than the Commanders now? No George Pickens contract expires at the end of this year, but they held out on paying Micah parsons so will they retain both? Who knows…
Man stop just stop!! 🛑 ✋ the Cowboys ain’t shiet. Ain’t been shiet & won’t be shiet why does the national media stay slurping this team?!
Cowboys defense hasn't been good in the playoffs the past several years. It aint all on Dak.
Tell me what Oline Dak has had to give him confront to let it go🤔
Tell em Shady
They will take care of him in Dallas.
They still miss the playoffs!
This won't work. Pickens will not be targeted. And when he is not targeted, and they lose, well, you lose him. Because when he isn't targeted and they win? They still lose him. This is a bombshell waiting to go off with him and CD and I can't wait to see it.
The Dallas Divas 🤣 2 crybaby receivers
LMAO Dem 'Boys ain't doing nothing beyond the 1st round of playoffs 🤣 😂   they still them CHOKEBOYS 🤣 😂
How Jerry listening to yall and neither CD or GP are speed guys
How the cowboys the most balanced offense with no running game and a trash o line 🤔 .  Pickens is trash and they still lookin like food to me 🦅
Cowboys are trash regardless of what these paid hype men are saying... they really think they gonna win 10-11-12 games! yall lost all credibility period
Go undefeated regular season then boom 1st round exit blowout Green Bay 76 cowboys 6 😊
My Minnesota Vikings are pretty balanced now!!! 💜💛💜💛
As a Dallas fan, LeSean McCoy spittin' TRUTH!
The Dallas Cowboys will win the SuperBowl 2025 - 2026 season
GP, may even be a 1 year rental for them Boyz. If he adapts ok, if not they let him go.
7:13. Chill out Acho
And then George is gone after the season. SMH
Giants will have a better record
Those running yards ain’t gone be easy to come buy against the Cowboys defense but this offense is starting to become stout get ready #4 get the job done
Shady is only on these shows for click bait, he has nothing solid to offer
I’m sorry wasn’t Pickens a liability last year
And then George is gone after the season. SMH
Eagles offense is better 🧐
Can't compare 30sumtin old Cooks vs 24 year old Pickens lol I wouldn't expect anything else from McCoy though
Tyler Guyon an all pro your an idiot..
Shady lives to hate on dak
Pickens is not it. He quits on the field and has many mental lapses. Not a culture guy. IMHO
As a Cowboys fan… From 5-12 to 6-11!! GO BOYS!!!
James saying Dak doesn’t throw 50/50 balls is dumb when that’s how MG13 got all his yards
Shady is just a cowboy hater
Cowboys Nation we what NFC championship game at home only did will we take our cowboys seriously 💯💯
Shady is just a cowboy hater
They still have Dak 😅
If the Steelers are getting rid of any their receivers I promise there’s a serious reason why . They know they’ll never be in position of picking in the top 10 unless they trade up so their maximizing in all the draft capital they can get .
Not even a minute in and they are saying Miles Sanders name as a good addition to the offense 😂😂
And just like that, Cowboys are now the SB champs of 2025
I'm glad Jerry finally did something. But it's not enough. Also, Dak will forever be a first round playoff elimination quarterback.
saying dak prescott has had help is laughable after watching the team jalen hurts just won the superbowl with
1:15 ummmm...the eagles...go birds...we aint worried
Teamed up a crash out with a artist (Former steelers fan, im tired bruh)
Now James tell the people who we had in the backfield during that time
Here we go again with the cowgirls preseason hype! The cycle just keeps going 😂
Why do you think that the Steelers practically gave you Pickens for free?😂
ok -so you hate the cowboys we get it. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂let’s go lets go….DC4L
I think we’ve seen this hype before for the Cowboys. I’m not falling for it.
It’s getting harder for me to admit this but Shady is right
If we’re being honest, we have to stop saying “OFF THE FIELD ISSUES”. He’s never been an off field problem. Just an on field hothead.
cowboys fan acting like this will matter AT ALL is so funny. like cmon man
Cowboys fans…..DONT ARGUE with nobody. Just let them watch. We’re supposed to be a 7 win team…let’s let ppl continue to say that
Ringo
I bet cowboys don’t make the playoffs
Did I just hear James Jones say Ringo instead of Mingo 😂
QBs needing a wr2 when a guy like Lamar never had a legit wr1 ... ever lol
Say it again Shady .. they didn't hear you  Dak's not good enough
They glazing Pickens so hard I thought they were talking about AJ brown
It’s always been Dak and romo before that . Trash !!
This what i will say dallas has to make it work on the field....
Shady has to see to believe it
How wheres the run game? Hows that balanced 😂😂😂
There talking about Pickens like he’s davante Adams 😂😂
Dak you got help. Now you have to get past the first round 😂. Watch this dumpster fire
Cowboys defense was good 2 years ago, if anything that was our year, now I don’t know, this was a good move but we will see though
The moment shady starts talking I’m out. That dude is a certified hater
Acho … the answer is the Detroit lions
9:39 I don't usually say this, but... Shady, right.
25 sound like a former eagle player when it comes to the COWBOYS.
Shady be riding Philly soooo hard. Like he was on them Superbowl teams, lol.  Bro, you won with KC n Tampa as a merc 😂 is okay to say something nice about Dallas
Cowboys are Back baby how about Dem Cowboys!!
As an eagles fan I’m not worried at all. If the Steelers are getting rid of a receiver it’s for good reasons
Anytime Shady says, “what are we talking about here” you know its about to get real 😂
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IS MAKING AMERICAS TEAM RELEVANT AGAIN. Let’s GOOOO!!!!
Shady saying defense don’t matter like his precious Jalen hurts wasn’t carried all of last year by his #1 defense 🤣🤣🤣 let’s not act like Daks defenses haven’t allowed an average of 250 rush yards in all playoff games
Cowboys couldn’t stop the run and couldn’t run the ball last season and I agree with shady dak crumbles in playoffs and when the defense was good too a couple years ago they also crumbled in playoffs
As long as Jerry owns the cowboys they aren’t winning anything. Let’s not kid ourselves lol.
Dang Shady you want Dak to play defense too😂 we couldn't stop the run Dak plays offense buddy 😂
9-8 at best
Idk, the Steelers usually are pretty good at moving a WR at the right time.
America Team is back.
If we put Jalen Hurts or Dak Prescott with the Carolina Panthers, who will have more success?
Cowboys still suck...
Im still worried about our defense. We were terrible last year. I know there were a lot of injuries... But I'm still was terrible.
Dak is the weak link, again.
Eagles have all that and some
The Steelers definitely has an upper hand in the draft class for next year so they got enuff room to build themselves a playoffs even a SB team. Omar Khan is the goat. STEELERS FANS BETTER WAKE TF UP AND SEE IT. WE MIGHT BE THE NEXT 70s STEELERS IN THIS ERA
Shady isnt right often but he nailed it today. Dak is the Achilles heel of this team. He does not have the grit for playoff success.
Shady goofy as always
As a packers fan living in Dallas ..nobodys worried about the cowgirls....no body is😂😂😂 the cowboys will always be the cowboys y'all need to stop gaslighting their season this early Dak is not the QB
Shady is just a typical eagles fan. He’s a hater. His QB in Philly was carried by Barkley and the Defence
Shady right!
ImagIne if Jalen had no WR2 or RB1. He's always had Devonta and a decent RB not to mention a top defense. 😂
This about to be Coach T 1st losing season
cant wait to c them split with the giants and swept by the commanders!  🦅
It's time for Dak to pull up on Shady at this point cause damn he never says anything decent about dude
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEASON TO START GO GO GO COWBOYS 🤗100
Its funny how shady forgets it took his eagles 70 years to win a superbowl, then they broke the cycle. Every team sucks until they don’t.
Most balance .... cmon acho they got a disgruntled (4) YR Wideout who is more acting than he is production .... Eagles > Commanders > Giants = Cowboys (At most 8 wins)
Pickens still can’t run routes he’s a good 50/50 ball DAK is still QB
IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, PRESCOTT IS THE PROBLEM
Wont make any difference. Still going finish 3rd in the division, and out of the playoffs once again.
I can't wait to see the cowboys destruct this year bhaha
Dak is great yall trippin him cd and gp gone make noise
Dez was injured in 2016 and wasn't the same. Just saying.
Difference is now we have a defense
Shady knows what’s good 😂best man to ask bout Cowgirls 😂
Hahahahaha one player has made them great 😂😂😂😂
Does cook just not exist he was good too
Shut your silly self up!!  Just worry about Philly don’t worry about Dallas !!!!  Dem ‘Boys!!!!
Shady is sooooooooo jealous of the cowboys.   Is shameful
Bradon cooks wasn't himself when we got gim and he's not pickens
Tampa...lol
Always glazing and hyping up a franchise that never passes round 1 if they make it😂
Dallas finally made a Philly move only four years behind
This dude can never separate himself from being an x player to an annalasist... You're not an eagle anymore bro stop being so freaking bias all the time. It's why no one likes to watch this show...
3 seconds in and I already think acho is out of his mind
They need to fire the shady weak link on the show
Shady is dumb asf why is he even on here
We have to remember how confident Chase is in next years QB class. We can not forget this
It's clear shady doesn't watch the Dallas defense when they are on the field in the playoffs
They are missing the fact that the issues with Dallas run much deeper than picking up another wide out. We will see in 2025.
Shady is a pure eagle so he will never say anything good about the cowboys
One of the most balanced? Cmon man definitely an over reaction
***Shady…25***. We hear you bruh!!!
Dak apologists will say it wasn't Daks fault. 10 years in.
Philly win 2 super  bowl  in 70year he thank the the best team ever
McCoy Cooks is not Pickens 😂😂
OK 👍
It’s not off the field issues, it’s on the field. Giving up and just standing there, or starting fights MID PLAY.
Cowboys are third in our division. It's a dumpster fire. If you were not bound by your culture to simp for Dak Prescott you would understand how delusional you need to be to think a 4th round aging often injured QB that just so happens to be 2-5 in post season and hits the franchise with the largest salary in the history of the sport. Come on Hurts and Daniels are better QB's at a fraction of the cost. Only a true Dallas homer doesn't pick philly or Washington to win the division. Cowboys don't make the playoffs.
two divas at wr want work
CAN THE COWBOY'S STOP THE *RUN* IN THE PLAYOFFS!?? THAT'S THE ISSUE. I MEAN, THEY'VE *ALWAYS* HAD OFFENSIVE WEAPONS.
Acho just described the eagles 🦅 relax man 😂
I'm over here still tripping how you guys on the show keep talking about that Prescott blowing it in the playoffs Michael parson is the leader of the defense The man got one sack in the in three games how y'all letting him off the hook He supposed to be a good defensive player Old world according to y'all but he's not he has one second three playoff games in the regular season he bowling just like that Prescott in the playoffs we can't find Michael We can't find Michael parson We can't find him so help me with this the leader of the old friends is that Prescott the lead of the defense is that Prescott I'm sorry it's Michael parson forgive me So both leaders of the offense in the defense is not getting it done in the playoffs they get it done in the regular season but the playoffs Michael Parsons nor  Prescott is getting it done
I dont know why Chase is on this show
They need to bench dak and put in joe and they will be better but not with dak
Shady is just a hater 100%
They don't have a running game 😂
Dak is far from a bad qb. But his playoff performances haunts him. And to be fair not all playoff losses were on him. But some were. So thats my fair observation lol. He has to play better in playoffs and hopefully this team will help them this year.
Dak can't get nothing done. I'm a cowboys fan but the facts is his best yr was the 1st yr he started. Point is the cowboys have all played a part in the team losses. Dak throws ints when he's scared to throw it. Now some of those are because the wideouts are running the wrong routes and etc .. everybody needs to be on accord
The cowgirl still trash go 9ers
I'm a die-hard Steelers fan. THANK GOD, George Pickens is gone, to the team I HATE the most. PLEASE DON'T SIGN AARON RODGERS
Don’t forget about Phil Mafah 👀
I think the Steelers are trying to play the longer game to set things up to be better in the coming years. Tomlin whether you like him or not, his record clearly shows he is one of the best coaches to ever do it.  So I am interested to see what he has in mind, and where he goes from here.
I don’t get it, why is shady less excited than the others?
Pickens is definitely worth a third round pick but I’m not sure it’ll work in Dallas. I wonder why the Broncos didn’t do this trade. A third? Can’t knock Dallas for this trade whether it works or not. What on 🌍 is the Steelers doing? Is there a quarterback to tank for next draft?
bro Shady. Dak played mid against the packers and it wouldve been good enough if the defense didnt let up 38 points. Did dak throw pics? yes. but the defense had already let up 28 before dak threw a single one
Name one ☝️ uhhh Eagles
It will be 4 pro bowl offensive lineman Cooper beebe is gone be a beast at center as well
Ceedee mother already says Dak ain’t it! We will see 😂😂
Shady ain't lying. Dallas was as stacked as the '24 Eagles in 2016, 2021 and in 2023. They got bounced every time.
Acho a clown Eagles are obvious the most balanced.
Normally Shady is hating, but this time his words ring true....its gone be on Dak shoulders to make sure that when the lights are the brightest he can stand up and be the QB we feel he is
The Detroit Lions
did james jones forget dak to gallup connection
"Dak doesn't play well in the playoffs" CAP!!! CHECK THE NUMBERS.
Here they go Eating Dallas like every show on ESPN every single year 😂😂😂😂😂
Calm down Cowboy fans, dont start up with the B.S. save it for the season start
Look at shady his hating it lmao Cowboys baby!!!!!
They need a qb
That Dez Bryant take was huge and was brush by a little fast. ❌ was him 💪
Lmao what a stupid take. Dak is great now and the cowboys can run the ball all of a sudden? Lmao pla
If you consistently put up good numbers with trubisky kenny pickett and mason rudolph yes your worth $30m wtf
Cowboys have shaky OL, no rb, and Dakota at qb lmao foh
Shaddy Mccoy just Hates the Cowboys he's partner with Stephen A and Shannon Sharpe...a  menage a trois for sure😂
Pickens has a million dollar body and a ten cent head.  Pickens will need to mature as a person and actually accept being a number two receiver and getting less catches in a contract year.  Will be fun to watch this implode
Bro how many great teams can you give a QB like really do yall not remember they had the most all pros yet got spanked 😂 not like they had great offense year after year yet got nothing in return for the money the owner put out 😂😂😂😂
Crazy how people saying dak trash and help don’t matter like hurts didn’t put up 100 yards a game with multiple turnovers every game and made it the Super Bowl every year our coaches and defense haven’t showed up just as much as him
I have little confidence in the Jones family to put together an actual contender but at least this year they are addressing a lot of big needs. Its great to see them bring in a impact player like Pickens and I think they will be much better than last year but unfortunately I still don't think they are closing the talent gap between themselves and both the Commanders and the Eagles.
I’m cowboys fan and shady is right! It’s going to look good but what is really going to be the difference maker if we already had a similar if not better roster before. Dez was the best an his numbers went down drastically when dak got in. I’d rather him throw a 50/50 ball interception than what he is doing. Defense ain’t scared so you are predictable(dak)
If our new HC is legit and we can stop the run then we are legit
Man the Steelers trade George Pickens to the Cowboys, the Steelers never keep players that's corny yo. 🏈   I know the Steelers are my team and all of that but they get on my nerves.
Bengals got 3 good WRs and a burrow and didn’t make playoffs
Cowboys just like the damn clippers don’t trust em
Just sitting here waiting for "Shady" to hate on the Cowboys...😂
Shady is a true Hater and I Luv it 😂😂😂
Everything acho described was the eagles lol you got pickens and lamb I give you mitchell and dejean
Terrible take , seriously
PREACH 25
Lemme guess cowboys fans… it’s y’all’s year ? 😂😂 clowns
Crazy they have to demean themselves like this for the cowboys
Great. Another 6'3 WR for Marshon Lattimore to pick fights with two times a year....
Can’t be serious smh so what happened to the Eagles offense ?!! Retained everyone except Becton sooo , what are we missing here ? lol 🦅
Man stop it this is small that dude ain't no baller. He can't run routes and don't block on outside all he has is a 50/50 ball
Shady is right, nothing will move the needle until dak is gone. He’s had all the weapons he needs. They brought a second reciever in Brandon cooks who was balling out with his qbs being rotated every year. Dak just wouldn’t look at cooks. Dak only looks for cedee and just throws it his way wether he’s open or not
Tolbert was already the deep threat. Receiving was already top 3 best position on their team. Unless coaching decisions, Dak decisions, and running game improve, we are going to see the same ole Cowboys. Team still seems worse than the Eagles and Commanders.
Is he gonna play without an extension and how much cancer does he bring with him
Shady coaches matter too
Whatever as long as Dak is there i will be as confident as when Romo was there that as long as Jerry is there they will always be the same Cowgirls who have won how many playoff games in 30 YEARS!?!
Not true. Dak threw 50 50 balls to Gallup alot
4 o lineman  Bebee
Gonna run through the eagles this year and he’s still gonna cry
How  about the Eagles have everything Acho just mentioned!
The same old story for the Cowboys. I will not hold my breath!
Knew JJ was gonna be 🥒 eating, they ain’t going to no super bowl
Shady swears he got all the ball knowledge bro go be a coach if you think you know so much if not stay quiet and do your job 😂
The Steelers released  Plaxico Burress and Antonio Brown and they won Super Bowl when leaving the Steelers.
Shady in love with Dak! Bro is so jealous of him it’s crazy never seen a bigger hater 😂😂
Dez was washed
Anyone else also skip past Acho?
Dis da same ol cowboys ppl lol... Cbt waut too see gp arguing wit dak
I'm old 64 older than the cowboys I just do not remember Dak having won a playoff game. Pickens was the guy who took plays off and drama when he does not get ball. Will the coach be able to be forceful with Jones on his shoulder? IDK so the Eagles are most balanced team cowboys should be competitive but they have to prove it. I would like to see any team win other than the Eagles. I hope it works out but there are questions about the coach . I am routing for 31 teams not named Eagles
James Jones is wrong about Dak not throwing the 50/50 balls and into tight window. He literally has led the league in tight window Throws the last few seasons so he’s wrong wrong.
James jones ....Dak does let the ball go
you left off cooper bebe future all pro
Now, if you can stop the run in the 4th quarter.
Dak it’s time to shut Shady tf up! Go handle your business this year
James Jones is wrong about Dak not throwing the 50/50 balls and into tight window. He literally has led the league and tight window. Throw the last few so he’s wrong wrong.
Shady is right tho when playoffs comes dak does terrible and even having a good players
He sounds bad he showing too much hate just a true hater
1:34 the Eagles, Niners ,and Lions………. And the Niners and Lions top WR duo, for both teams, have all pros receiver, and tight end, and defensively we know what they are and we know what Dallas is defensively, Dallas is built for the pass heavy team, once they see a running heavy team they get bullied
What off the field stuff?
Shady a hater on my soul
Talk about when Pickens don’t get the ball and his attitude is terrible. He cares more about his numbers then his team
Chase is a 🤡,  always will, talks non sense.  No one is worried about this trade. Pickens is a drama queen who will get ejected in every game 😂
So ..  Ceedee Lamb George Pickens  Jake Ferguson  Kavonte Turpin  Jalen Tolbert  … who stopping that ?
Welcome to Quintanamo bay.
They have no run game or tide end.
Shady be talking like he was ever a major contributor to a championship team you Dak 😂😂
Still 3rd in nfc east😅
Dak had Gallup, Ceedee and Coop with a great oline and zeke in his prime. The cowboys will do what they do every year. This ain’t the first time Dak has had help. He’s had help basically his entire career
Chase said the Steelers don't want to deal with the headache yet they waiting on Aaron. I'm sorry this is just entertaining. Joy im sorry for you😂
EAGLES
Mccoy a idiot. Can’t even talk
Shady just a damn hater point blank period! Dak better then half the quarterback in the league probably top 10-13 but the only one that get so much hate!!!
Love how the media spins to make George Pickens a problem when in all actuality he’s probably upset because he doesn’t have a good enough QB 😂😂😂 Steelers are idiots 😂 NO viable QB and one less weapon 😂
Doing all of this just to go 9-8 again
Hmmm, I do like Shady's take
Love the pick up but know QB still
Mccoy talking facts
The only place the Cowboys will be during the playoffs? Resting at home😂😂😂
Now go after Isaiah Bond
Stop hating shady...lol
Dak don't choked in playoff. no more excuses ¡!!!!
as usual these buffoons can't see the big picture
Ngl ... this lowkey scary as a eagles fan but am still not sweatin bc ion care that run game ain't established an unproven
They're the Cowboys Acho😅
Steelers are idiots 😂 NO viable QB and one less weapon 😂
Shady cant be anything less than well.. SHADY when it comes to the boys
So when Dak chokes in the playoffs who gets the blame???? Lol
Dawg cooks was a shell of himself with us we didn’t know how to use him either…but we went 12 wins 3 times with that…we just need defense to help in the playoffs and more then one wr
Who is Ringo??? Lol 🤣🤣
The cowboys are still trash!!! 🗑️
Everyone talking about this draft capital as if we’re for sure gonna get the right QB when in reality no one knows. And to say are we gonna miss 900 yds and 4tds as if he couldn’t have more if we had a Qb is poor analysis and grabbing at low hanging fruit. We loss this trade because the TEAM preaches win NOW loll this doesn’t do that. I wish him the best and I bet his “attitude” problem will dissipate being in what I think is an actual good offensive scheme. Dak might not be a great Qb but he’s better than every Qb Gp had
Here we Go...  The off season hype of the Cowboys.  When will yall learn 😂😂😂
You knew Shady was going to say something bad
Im sorry to say im with shady, im worried about Dak, but theres no more excuses for him this year, Jerry gave him all the help now
Cowboys suck
Lol now you know these clowns dont know dak. Dak has the highest completion percentage when throwing into coverage. When 90% of the play book was 5-10yd curls, you have no choice but throw contested balls... at least try to be accurate lol
Lmao Micheal Gallup?
How much money does Jerry pay the networks to keep talking like this team is anything to worry about? Let's talk about relevant teams
Shady is a joke and the hate is real, but Dak needs to show up and show out!
Dak just fxxking sucks
Take away one of the eagles top to WRS and hurts gone struggle. Dak has never had rtwo recievers this good at the same time. And dont say amari cooper becuase cd was not as good at the time. Shady ia a hater.
Dallas fans that watch film know dak isnt the problem. Watch the film. The past 3 years, the entire offensive sceme was 3-4 comeback routes. Every. Play. Run 5-10 yards, stop and look at dak. Thats been their entire playbook since garret was coach. Why do you think personel never mattered and they always got the same results?
We haven't seen Shady since he revealed the bs with how Shedduer was treated in the NFL draft. He went hard for Shedduer and was absent from the show until now. He's back on script by criticizing Dak Prescott.
I'm glad we got him, but I'm not getting my hopes up.
Cowboys don't have a top 5 WR duo.. I think the Eagles, Bengals, Rams, Dolphins, & Lions all have better WR duos than the Cowboys and their run game is still suspect.
LET EM KNOW SHADY!!  And I’m saying this as a Commanders fan 😂
i say the eagles are the most balanced lol acho meat riding and pickens is a one year rental unless jerry paying him ceedee money
My question is this, how did Jalen Hurts look before the acquisition of receiver AJ Brown? The Eagles were comparing his performance to Dak Prescott’s performance and actually didn’t think he was the best QB for them until AJ Brown showed up.
Lipstick on a pig..
Ok 11 wins = stil 1st round exit smh  Cowboys stil 🗑️
idk where Acho is getting Tyler Guyton as an all pro.  That would be great, but that's as much a stretch right now as Herbert to the HOF
Shady ain’t never won a ring btw
If we’re going by just saying draft picks will be good without seeing them play then the bengals offense has all of those things
Idc about what these none fans say cowboys going to have to good season and hopefully a better playoff run ...
Having firepower in offense means nothing when ur defense is giving up 150+ a game on the ground especially  when you can't run the ball.  A drive or 2 with no points and now you playing from behind all game. Shady should know that  with that said, if they can't stop the run or run the ball again it's the same ol team no matter who catching  it throwing the ball
Let’s put it this way… the Eagles were an average team. Everybody pumped up to be world beaters but if you watch their games average! Cowboy will at least be able to compete with them and in the east… my money is on Philly to come back to earth and have an average season… Washington is the team to beat.
how is the offense balanced when there is little to no proven running game
Philadelphia eagles way better team super bowl champions better than Dallas cowboys
As I predicted shady stay negative towards dak. Shady act like Dak did something to him personally 😂
Wahtttttttttttt
Cowboys talk Plz stop smh  Not enough
Eagles RUN! the NFC, & are THEE most balanced team in the NFL.
The Cowboys are not a slightly above average receiver away from 11 wins. There’s a reason the Steelers got rid of him, he’s about as good as a receiver picked in the 3rd round. Steelers have proven that can find just as good talent in later rounds that will not cost them. He also has reputation as being a headache.
Yea one of the best offenses with Noah brown as my third wideout yea ok
Shady didn’t say shi but hate on Dak😭😭😭💀
Shady is right Cowboys have had some good rosters
Shady is awful
CHASE A HATER!!!!! NO LONGER A SUB!!!
Everything he said at 1:30 the eagles have but better. All of that just to lose
Is anyone else getting tired of Shady and his arrogant, condescending energy? Like he really thinks because he had the best career of all of them he can move a certain way, like talking too much and talking over the others and etc. It's getting annoying...
The trade is a big deal
Why everyone saying the qb class is big most of those guys were backups and not really that good to be honost
Hate it is true that Shady is correct. Dak is great in the regular season. We need him to be great in the playoffs. They should make the playoffs. Can they perform in the playoffs now?  Time will tell.
Don’t let national Media try to sell y’all a Cowboy story. This guy couldn’t catch a cold in the winter time last year, now y’all think he AB🤦🏾‍♂️
What is Acho smoking it’s the cowboys what can go wrong will go wrong lmao
I guess yall forgot that everybody and they mama was hurt last year!
Shady just want to blame Dak, that GB playoff loss was on that defense 😂
Nobody cares about cowgirls still got dak
The return of the NFC BEAST Americas team, the pigeons,the dead skins and the migets
Asking Shady about Dallas is always the same. His hater takes never changes
Shaddy always  hating  b quiet
They are AMERICAS team and always will be if you know were it stems from but if you are altering history than you dont know this..And WE STILL DEM BOYZ
That's awesome, but dak is still our QB...
This year is an evaluation year with new coaching staff and new players. I believe Dak finally has a defense after DQ couldn't stop the run when being DC. Likewise, the OL is a bit young so we have to see what the running game looks like.
Acho 🛑 the 🧢😂
Aye naw Shady speaking all facts
Emanuel don’t know what he talking about sometimes. He makes my head hurt with his politically correct takes.  Brah just give the damn real. Gosh
I see why they call him Shady!
I came to hear McCoy hate. As a Cowboys fan, this guy is hilarious.
I'm a cowboy fan, Respect to everything shady just said
As much as you all hate the cowboys gotta admit they actually making some moves
I think the cowboys may have the best offense     ON MADDEN 26 😂
Dak owns philly
Put Turp in the slot
I agree with shady and I live in Dallas… dal has always had help and always shrinks when it matters most
Those playoff failures were the whole team folding not just Dak
Once I heard Miles Sanders  I hit the pause button.
I'd say the eagles and lions are more balanced to name a few
George Pickens is all hype. Cowboys still gonna be trash. They don't have a real running game so how are they balanced? Just another year of hype.
I wasnt excited about rhe brandon cook signing
Once I heard Miles Sanders  I hit the pause button.
shady the only person criticizing this obvious disaster. hammer the under
Shady is a hater!!!!
The other team is the Philadelphia Eagles and we are better on defense also the superbowl champs
Ocho ,james stop  keep drinking that koolaid. You wont win with Dak..😂😂😂
They ain't dem boyz until they prove otherwise.  1 receiver isn't going to fix their problems.
Disappointed in Shady’s take. Are we not allowed to be excited for any regular season games? It’s not like those 18 weeks are don’t exist. Lose  lose for any cowboys take.
The Texans
It’s the cowboys brah, they always make moves, but with no coach and a meddling owner they are still the same lame Cowboys.
Why do they never talk about the negatives? There is a reason why Pittsburgh was happy to say goodbye to this WR.
Respectfully this the same energy they had for Jalen Hurts. He had Smitty, AJ Brown and it was all on QB 1. He delivered. Now its on Dak. What is he going to do?
Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ he is our only hope, just repent and have child like humble faith God bless!
Can someone name me the Cowboys Offensive Coordinator?
Once the backup gets the starting role we them Boyz
Not really Pickens and lamb gone be crazy on the sideline they divas this is not tee Higgins and Jamar chase this is two crashouts who both want the ball and love being in front of the camera for the wrong reasons
When the Cowboys win a playoff game then maybe the rest of us will take all this Cowboy talk seriously
Yall keep blaming Dak for the playoffs. I can see if the team was balling. Don’t nobody remember months after the game how the defense gave up 30 plus. Or how mfs be getting stupid penalties. They make it seem like they in the game and Dak throw a pick 6 in the 4th
When you have 3 rbs.. you don't have a rb. Also,  lamb and Pickens isn't a top 5 duo
How are they balanced? With no run game?
As soon as shady starts talking I end my viewing session. I can’t take the blatant bias
I say give it to Milton and have a better chance
At the end of the day ........ they still got Dak😂😂😂😂😂
Shady is a hater with zero analysis lol
Shady brought up old man Brandon Cooks lol
Elite defense know micah came in making cowboys look great trevon good year made xowboys look good daron bland made us good but all around Noooooooo
Dak will get us to the second round of the playoffs then he will get traded during the offseason.
Stop it!!!!
These dudes don’t know about this guy, he was nothing but issues, not running routes, not on time, issues after issues
Shadys the best on tv
Bucs offense 🗣
It’s not guaranteed next years class will be great— many of the options can opt to stay in school
This why we rock with Shady. He’s NOT about to let y’all gas it up 🤣  As long as Dak is the Qb. The NFC East is safe 💯
Cowboy's in the playoffs, Pittsburgh Steelers will be taking about firing Tomlin. Wilson with healthy receivers was good, don't understand Pittsburgh.
Jesus shady has no idea what he's talking about
Most balanced those RB’s are terrible & unproven they have no run game rn
I agree with shady 100% the problem is dak. Period!!
$100 says them two Divas at wideout are clashing by week 6
Let's not start with super bowl talk yet.  Let's wait til Pick and CD are actually on the field together
1:20 uhm.. Washington!!
They still don't have a run game,  a true slot receiver, and yeah Pickens is not bad but he drops passes in the most crucial moments. They are still multiple tiers below a eagles team for balanced offense.
Bro with you there dammed if they do and dammed if the don’t you ain’t ever happy for them boys always hating
Comparing a first contract qb to a 3rd contract qb is wild
George Pickens.. fried chicken .. dak bitching … Eagles we fly 🦅
Eagles 🦅 Best RB & WR Duo 💯💯
Bro act like dak Prescott got his girl ! The DALLAS COWBOYS DID SOMETHING SERIOUS TO SHADYS MENTAL STATE
What do Mcoy do in the playoffs
Sports shows are paid to talk about the irrelevant Cowboys.
Ignoring the fact that the defense gives up over 200 rushing yards to completely blame Dak for the playoffs losses is nasty work.
Try don’t even have a #1 RB 😂???
The bears
Cowboys still going to be 🗑️
That is a great move for Dallas. Unfortunately dink and dak won't be able to get Pickens the ball.
Ocho, i gatta give it to you and Jay. Your opinions are void of sentiments but focused on objectivity.  Someine needs to teach that to that Eagles person, funny, ive forgotten his name.
Cooper Bebe All Pro as well dude!
Hate on shady
Bro SHADY IS A STR8 HATER DUDE WTF
Cowboys get more credit from these guy for offseason signings than the Eagles did for winning a Superbowl
These analyst are pathetic
NFC Beast coming back! WASHINGTON FAN! Everyone chasing down Philadelphia now 😆
Who is Dallas coach again
Why does Shady hate on Dak so much ??
It’s crazy that we won’t get at least one year of two WR 1s with DK and Pickens with Rodgers throwing to them, damn.
Shady told the truth.   They been having a great roster for years.   Playoffs are a different monster.  We know what happens in the playoffs.
He’s not gonna be there long term and we gave up a 3rd round pick this is not that great
How this turn to Dak….James you are funny
Eagles
There is a reason why teams underutilized Miles Sanders and Javontae Williams. They are names…
As a Boys fan, Shady is 💯
naahhhhh fammm a wise man once said 🗣"It's not enough" - Kendrick Lamar.. and the eagles still won the Super Bowl 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🚨
Boo, everybody scrambling to catch up with the CHAMPS 🏆 nobody scared of Pickens
The lions do duh!!!
Well said brother!
As a cowboy fan I can definitely say DAK CAN...AND WILL DEFINITELY...LET THAT BALL GO!  It's what drives us crazy when we screaming "WHY WOULD HE THROW THAT"!!
1:18 um the Philadelphia Eagles Cincinnati Bengals. Houston Texans list goes on and on. Unless the NFL changed to two QBs out there tossing the ball I see this as ok one of those divas is going to cry.
There is a team in the NFC East that won the Super Bowl last year that is pretty balanced 😂 Acho is the King of overreacting ‼️
This kind of feels like the Luka trade to me. They feel like he going to crash out. So they want to get something for him before he does
Defense was not phenomenal
I always stop the video when Stuttering Stanley Shady starts talking. Never anything of substance but Eagle rah-rah
Shady have so much hate for Dak..Sad
Ocho do you know how the NFL works? You get compensated by draft picks if your players leave and go to another team. Chase 900 yes and 4 TDS is all GP14 can do? Cmon man he never had a QB
This is so painful for the haters!!😂..DC4L!
Bro, please there not gonna be no top five offense Pickens will ruin that trust me once he doesn’t get the ball you’ll see
Shady ain’t letting up 6:49 😂😂😂
It wasn’t just dak in those games
Now all we need is a quarterback!
Physically balanced, maybe. Mentally balanced, definitely NOT!😊
Went from possible 4th place finish to GUARANTEED third place finish
Dak was 3-5 with one WR and trying to figure out the backfield. Not sure when Parsons and DLaw went down.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂boy listen
I don’t like Shady but he speaking facts though
Shady looks Salty
Listening to McCoy is the same thing as listening to Kamala Harris complain about Trump! McCoy was an average back at best just stats are only high because he never played behind an average line he always played behind HOF HOGS! That’s facts look it up he thinks he knows everything but he couldn’t win the big one until they got a real 100% truly talented RB and shady was just the back up when the workhorse needed a breather.
This trade is different from the cooks trade tho. you can’t compare the 2. An aging cooks but a PRIME GEORGE PICKENS.
Another diva in Dallas.  Going to be epic when Pickens grab Dak on the sidelines when he's not getting the ball.
Shady is so good at this because he doesn’t need to be smart he just brings clicks
Dez also came back early from injuries in Dak 2nd year
Shady right So over 11 new coacges dont matter?  Random RBs dont matter?  Suspect O-line dont matter?  Who is the TE?  Can they stop the run ?  Stop lying to the public because yall want ratings from the Cowgirls and their fans
Look man that year losing to the packers in the first round was rough but to say the weapons were good is not true, you only had Lamb to throw to. Gallup was awful all year and Cooks was a no show in alot of games... pollard did ball out but what killed us was having to force the ball
🤦🏼‍♂️
Shady better have the same hate for Lamar Jackson🤷🏻
I have to agree with Shady. he is right!
No.
Dak Prescott is the only QB who plays offense and defense in the NFL 😂😂😂 cuz the defense don't cause no turnovers or sacks in the playoffs ijs
I’ve been agreeing with Shadys takes waaaaayyy too much lately. Time to buy a lotto ticket
A way better version of Gallup
Happy Wednesday! It's the perfect day to find joy in the little things.
Steelers let go of  Santonio Holmes Mike Wallace Antonio Brown Emmanuel Sanders all them were trash except Sanders
Let Milton start
As a Cowboys fan….Dak now has ZERO excuses.  Hopefully the front office has some phone numbers in their pocket for som qb’s
This is part of the Steelers master plan to fire Mike Tomlin. 😂
Pickens is a problem on the sideline.Ask yourself why Pittsburgh didn't give him an extension. Remember that game in December how Pickens acted on the sidelines. Better yet the more Dallas throws the more their at risk of turning over the ball with Dak throwing.
The name "Shady", was on full display... The mouth was closed... The playoffs came down to the coaches.. Other teams out-coached the Yes, sir Cowboy coaches
Shut up acho 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂cowboys ain’t beating Philly
I can’t wait to see deuce Vaughn in the plays he’s explosive!!! Put him in the scheme!
The steelers gave a superstar because of tomlin's bad coaching. Two runs a pass and a punt .And you blame the wide receiver for being mad.
Nobody using George Pickens and the word balance in the same sentence..🙄🤣🤣🤣
Pittsburgh Steeles going to have to trade for Kirk Cousins now.
The most talked about team in American history. AMERICA'S TEAM, THEE ONE AND ONLY, DALLAS COWBOYS. Spew more hate please. Bunch of undercover DALLAS COWBOYS fans! Lol.
Pickens has 0 maturity, and he doesn't want to be a 2 receiver.  He will throw a fit because he doesn't get the most balls thrown to him. He will want 25+ million a year contract at the end of next year and is not worth it will him lack of maturity and mental discipline. And the Steelers are, arguably, the second biggest brand in football with a coach that is great at controlling big personalities and he was done with Pickens and now you hand this immature idiot to a rookie coach?
Get acho off tv 📺 please ‼️
Once again, Shady dropping "Truth Shade!!!"
Pickens and Dakota will be fighting by week 7
Okay Dak, Pickens, Lamb. No Run game, No run defense. Cornerback play sucks. No safeties. Got Micah but that’s it😂😂
Well said well said Acho u couldn’t said it no better!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
We've been seeing this story for over 25 years
Steelers are freaking stupid to give up Pickens when u got DK as well
You’re not gonna suck me back in.    Nope
Dakota a turnover machine lol
I agree with Shady and as a Dallas fan, I don't agree with Shady very often.. Dak needs to step up!!! No more excuses!!!
Eagles still they daddy 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shady saying i done seen all this before 😂
As a Steelers fan, when people say George Pickens "off the field issues", it's funny to hear. Because believe it or not, all of his behavioral concerns are ON THE FIELD! Quite the opposite for most receivers perceived as troublemakers 😂.
😂😂 it’s crazy that howie and the eagles have the same picks next draft
What if Pickens don't get the ball 🏈  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 remember if he doesn't get the ball he will not block 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shady is a big time hater!!!!
THANK YOU JAMES. Dak does NOT throw 50/50 balls
10-12 wins where? 😅😅😅 You got the eagles and Washington just in the division not to mention the nfc north this year with the afc west schedule 😅😅😅8-9 @ best 😅
Dez bryant literally broke his foot and wasnt the same thats why his numbers dipped. He was also dropping balls every game
Till one is the Wr start crying when about targets
All these analysts on here wow..
It’s still Eagles, commanders, Dallas and NY
They bugging. They have no run game.
A disgruntled player going to a dis functional team lol 🦅🦅🦅
SHADY ALWAYS HATING!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT  HAPPEN LAST YEAR NEVER MATTERS !!!!!
Cowboys sign a WR and now its back to "tHiS iS OuR yEaR"😂😂
Acho: "Name another team that"   The Eagles literally still do everyone of those things better.
I CAN'T STAND ACHO!!!
Ohcho just be saying anything
Imagine if they drafted Sheduer and had all that draft capital to build around him they banking on an overrated class next year
Shady being Shady. A hater.
Shady has such lazy analysis
Cowboys have Milton now. I’m not stressing, even if dak chokes again
Acho, you done lost your mind. Jadan Blue is small, and the other running backs are mid. The offensive line is inconsistent, and Dak is starting to become injury prone.
All what everyone said is basically there’s no excuses for Dak or the Cowboys.
Defense is what’s going to take them deep in the playoffs and as of right now Dallas still can’t stop the run.
And the sneak attack is K TURPIN! Give him another year to solidify that strong slot receiver ala Cole Beasley, man the sky is the limit w this offense. Dak has always been. Better w a run game so “IF” (big if I know), they can get that going and he gets decent protection so he’s not running for his life, this is going to be a fun team to watch. Will they make it past the first round? Proly not lol but they are what I like to call junk food/soap opera football. Fun to watch and lots of emotional roller coaster issues, not a lot of depth. Until they can prove me wrong, that’s what they’ll be. But I will say, thank you Jerry, ffs this is what was needed for a while.
1:15 ravens
This puts more pressure on Dak honestly
Chicago Bears has better weapons.
I just mute it for skup ahead when Mccoy is talking. He's just a diehard Philly guy and Cowboys hater. He ain't about to say anything objectively.
So no excuses is what I’m hearing?
Shady giving Joy Taylor energy LOL!!!🤣🤣
Shady SICK 😂
Running back is what makes the cowboys the cowboys. The land of Emmitt Smith.
Thanks James Jones. I’ve said the same thing about Dak to Dez.  We’ll see. Hopefully an older Dak trusts his new WR.
Wow someone is finally talking about how dak never throws 50 balls and doesn’t throw people open that’s his biggest problem he won’t throw it unless the receiver is wide open
If the COWBOYS win 12 games, how many games are the EAGLES AND COMMANDERS winning 🤔
The 🦅 have the best receivers. The best running back. The best offensive line and a better quarterback. AJ Brown, Barkley and Smith are better
As Long is Dak the QB All that don't Matter!! lol!
shady is the biggest hater in cowboys history like get off your feelings and be professional , every time they ask him about the cowboys he just can't say anything because he is a hater , get this dude out of this show
This dude is the definition of overrated.
Shady speaking facts
I guess Hurts, Brown, Smith, Dotson Goedert, Calcatera & Barkley just isnt balanced enough.  Ezekiel Elliott must REALLY put the cowboys over the top eh?😂
Shady is Such A hater 😮😮😮 . How Sad ❗😶
1:27 the eagles 🦅
I’m a Cowboys fan and was ready to give up on them 2 years ago. Didn’t watch many games last year I stuck with college football. I 100% agree with Shady. Even if we go win 10-12 games it doesn’t matter. If we go one and done in the playoffs again I think I’m done for good.
11:23 James Jones cooking Dak with historical facts 😂
Did they forget who the Quarterback was?
GO BIRDS!🦅🦅🦅
Is this the same guy who quit on the Steelers ?13:40
Haha Pickens he don't even try on the field lol he's worse than cooper and they let go of him cause he was no show on the road lolol idiots in Dallas lolol
Shady knows nothing 😂😂 he just a Dak hater lol it’s low key embarrassing
If this coach don't work out Jerry Jones gonna hire chase Daniel's next lol
COWBOYS !!!
If I hear Acho say simultaneously one more time I might lost it
Hey James, year in year out, Dak is one of the top QBs in completing passes when there is very little separation.  Study the facts before using anecdotal falsehoods courtesy of the way-back machine.
This guy plays when he wants to. Smh
What run game do they have? Where’s the defense? MAN, please!!!
Yall say this every year lmaooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chase with another great take. James' take was valid too.
If George Pickens was in this draft does he go number 1?🧐
THIS IS IT! THE COWBOYS ARE WINNING THE SUPERBOWL! LOL! (Every year it's the SAME Bullsh*t.) The Cowboys are a joke, Jerry Jones is a joke, and James Jones is a joke!
All of NFL? Lmaoo  Maaaan
Still not going nowhere 😂😂😂😂
Shady: “George Pickens ceedee lamb I love to see that” no u don’t. Do not lie😂
shady stay hating... all he talks about is dak!  It's 53 people on a roster!
Shady actually has a point though
I don't understand why they keep trying to hype up next year QB class..... It's not that much better than this past year class, and this was a weak class
The cowboys😂😂😂😂😂 nothing gone change. Just wait as Steven A. Say
So yall think a washed up javontae Williams, a washed miles sanders, and an improven rookie makes this a balanced offense? This is why even random fans can do what they are doing. Just say nonsensical things loudly 😂
Everything and every position stacked next year until the season takes place and the next draft happens
Eagles will not be the same w/o Kellen Moore's offense.
Crash -out incoming 😂😂  Week 6  zero targets at the half,  3rd quarter 3:04 mark the date 📅 😂😂
That OL that Dak had with pollard and Zeke was old and on its last leg, this a fresh and bigger OL. This team is gonna be a beast.
Cowboys 🤠 to win the Superbowl now 😂😂😂
I agree with shady
Shady is a Hater of another Realm 😒 He always always knows how to hate. The defense Sucked against the Run the last 2 years under Quinn & got treated bad against GB in the Playoffs - Facts. Dude is Top 3 Most Unobjective Bias analyst.
Here goes Chase again talking about this imaginary good QB class when none of the so called top picks next year come even close to Cam Ward currently so are we just projecting some miracle season and teams will do what? Draft them off of one good season?😂😂 smh
From a Steelers fan, you all can have George Pickens. He is not a team player and very selfish. Look at all the shenanigans he did last year. And the most intolerable thing is him quitting on his team. George Pickens for the Cowboys will be like what happened when we sent Chase Claypool  to the Bears.
Only other offense balanced like that is Philly
Now just put joe at qb and that’s a whole different look
Weapons around Dark isn't the problem. Dak is the problem, only good in regular season
I can’t wait til Zack Baun splits him in half goin across the middle
So dis is about Dak not da topic doesn't surprise me Dak makes every throw what are we really talking bout here all they doing is down talking da quarterback
Pickens is the worst type of WR for Dak. Pickens is now the Cowboys' problem to deal with. The former players on this panel should know character and personality is almost as important as your level of talent. Pickens will be the common example of someone who'll never reach their true potential.
It looks good, only on paper😂😂😂😂
They trying to get Tomlin fired
Why not talk about how good Pickens is
0:28 Ah oh here comes the Super Bowl talks again.
The super eagle is the only only one being real about the cowboys😂😂
The STEELERS!!! Have all the pieces you said!! But you guys play the narrative of hating on them!!
As a Cowboys fan, Shady hit the nail on the head for someone who watches all the games.
James is speaking the truth about Jack also
The Cowboys will have a great run game trust me it will happen.
Not gonna matter cause dak is throwing 3 picks in the divisional round and getting bumped
Eagles  and commodes are put on notice we here we aint going no where lets go cowboys!!
Stop hating on the Cowboys,  I bet some of you guys who are commenting badly about the Cowboys I bet the team you like probably sucks and have not won a Superbowl
Shady acts like phillys qb isn’t the weakest link on that offense 😂
They’re trippin. Nobody is worried about Pickens on the cowboys
Im a true blue Cowboy fan....the difference between Shady and Stephen A is Shady speaks truth.....shady is 100 on Dak....I have said same thing....I have been saying yeah But Dak....outside of NFC East he sucks
Who’s throwing to these receivers??
Shady is the ultimate HATER
Sounds good 😅😅😅
Shady don’t know what he’s talking about
All that still 3rd best team in division
Sorry Chase, they've already been working on this deal for a while bruh 😒😄
Mane, terrible analysis by James.. Dak hesitant throwing 50/50 balls because who was gonna catch them lol.. That’s not even Ceedee game.. He brought up Dez like it was 2012 Dez lol.. Did you see Dak with Gallup?? That was the last 50/50 receiver Dallas had
0:26 Acho, please 😂   Their o-line is questionable at best and they have no proven run game.   More of the same, with Pickens trying to take Ceedee shine
I'm a cowboys fan and this is trash 🗑we did the same thing with Cooper #9
they have no rb and still have dak😂😂😂
GEORGE PICKENS & CEEDEE LAMB COULD BE THE BEST WR DUO IN THE LEAGUE ..
He called him "Ringo" 🤣🤣🤣
Name another team with a blocking catching TE a top 5 receiving corp powerbacks and receiving backs run and pass blocking offensive line? Ummm the Eagles?
Do y’all not remember dez was hurt? Do y’all not remember they had Ezekiel Elliott getting 1500 yards touching the ball 300 times? Dak was going toe to toe with Tom Brady for most 4th qt wins. Do y’all not remember them having the number 1 offense 2 years ago for like 3 years straight? And that was with a young ceedee. Narratives will always be 1 sided folks.
Shady is such a hater. Cowboys haven’t made a huge trade except to get Amari. I’d sign Amari for 5-6 mil and he’s 3 receiver.
Using his stats against him while also admitting his QB play was trash is crazy…..
Acho just seems to always have the wrong opinion😂
Has Pickens matured? Have the Cowboys changed their losing zoo culture? No and no? Go birds
As long as dak is QB they will still choke in the playoffs
Lol, Pickens going to another team not called the Steelers... sounds like a ticking time bomb...  Good luck Cowboys.  To most of the Facility crew.. this is not Madden football, team chemistry matters we dont live in a #'s perfect vacuum.
Shady is 1,000% correct.
Dak does not throw 50/50 balls or deep balls. Play action type of QB
Well said Acho
Shady fails to realize how awful the cowboys defense has been in the post season lmao
Shady going down the same road Shannon sharp and skip he's gonna have bad luck hating on the cowboys and he's a lowdown dirty Yankee 😅😅😅😅😂❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉😊😊
Cowboys have good personnel on offense but do you trust their HC & OC to put them in a position to succeed? Do you trust Dak to get it done when it matters most? 🤷🏾‍♂️ We shall see
Everything Acho said Eagles got it. Only difference we’ve seen it in action with the Eagles.
As an eagles fan this is a good pick up ! Love seeing our division getting better and more competitive.
😂😂 Pickens is overrated
Dak was 2nd team all pro with one weapon in ceedee   Now you have another option. Most teams have two options.  cowboys going to be scary if they can stay healthy.  Cowboys season will depend on the defense, shady blaming dak but it all on the defense    James comparing 2016 dez to 2014 dez is criminal 😂 Dez wasn’t the same player after that 2015 injury
They just lost arguably the best olineman of this generation, and their oline was mediocre with him. Guyton looked completely lost as a rookie. I don't understand how anybody can feel good about their oline.
Shady is Cappin. You would’ve thought he was speaking facts with his conviction but it’s just regurgitated narratives made popular by Stephen A
Shady on point its not like Jerry never gave dak help but when it counts he chokes
Shady 1000% correct
Shady finds a way to hold his nuts on Dak...but will suck Josh Allen's 🍆 because he wins a couple playoff games😂😂🤣
Cowboys literally the Lakers of the NFL overrated
You can bring superman to Dallas and Shady will hate
Wack Prescott is still the QB.  Cooks was a good WR until he came to Dallas with Wack as the QB. Pickens will hate playing with Wack.
I’m a cowboys fan but I’m also a shady fan because he’s real!!
Shady a irogent hater lol
Im with Shady on this topic, forget the season.  What is Dak going to do in the playoffs?!!
Here's the problems when acho asked what teams has all the things he asked.... Not many but the teams that do are teams that are in their division that are better than them😂
Here we go again lol cowboys in the super bowl. Go ahead and jump on the wagon lol.
They do nothing but hate on dak
Cooks plays 8 games a year
Did this man say Dallas has one of the most stable offenses? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hold up did this fool say the cowboys have the most balanced offense in the nfl? Please get acho off TV
It’s still all on Dak to throw balls they can catch stop throwing balls behind in dirty and over head. Dak does not throw 50/50 or back shoulder balls
shady aint lying
Cooks by the time he got to us was no where near where Pickens is now...
Was anyone surprised by Shady's take on this?
Shady is heated up bc cowboys with George Pickens hurts his eagles team badly
Shady hate Dak
See what James Jones is saying now wasn’t said by Skip Bayless and Shannon. They had the media saying Dez was a** 11:17
Vikings have the same thing look at the roster lmao and they’re wayyy bettter lol
Shady real asf
Chase speaking facts!!! Sucks we lost Pickens but we’re looking to draft our next franchise qb in our city next year!!
Shady’s takes are so old and sad. He’s always blaming Dak. He has nothing objective to say other than to talk bad about Dak. It’s almost like he has something personal against him.
LOL cowboys are trash at negotiating FA contracts and wait too long before overpaying. Good luck with Pickens, who will demand max money next season
Shady is such a hater!!
Shady has the IQ of a mosquito
Wow acho make them the super bowl representative will you i totally disagree George Pickens is overrated and a pouter who doesn't give max effort they are a 7 or 8 win team
Micah Parsons and George Pickens in the same locker room is gonna be barnum and bailey's
The eagles are the most balanced offense in the nfl.😊😊😊
Dallas will be no joke
Shady mad asf!! Anybody saying other wise are eagles fans trying to hold it together because Dallas has had a damn good offseason. All it takes is one offseason to get back in contention.
Preach Shady!
Why don’t they talk about the bills & ravens the same way? There in the same situation every year! Ball tf out all year, unstoppable on the ground & come up short to kermit the frog every offseason. Lamar and josh Allen have not had a superbowl appearance or had the caliber to step their team up yet. Yet have the coaches and players & nobody ever addresses them just “watch how they do it this year” It’s just cowboys this and cowboys that😂
Pickens to up and down.  Very emotional guy.  He gone behave the first year to get paid then the real J-Pickens gone come out…
Tf is shady talking about
It’s clear Jerry pays for propaganda
Shady don’t know what he talking about we get that you don’t like the cowboys but what help was you talking about be fr with yourself
The Vikings have all the same things the cowboys have😂. Just gotta see if McCarthy is as good as Dak or better
Here we go with Chase Daniel’s glazing Dak and the cowboy offense 🤡
You can tell shady got shook with this move 😂
George Pickens highlight reel is all push offs . NFL refs stink !
Sanders gonna get cut
Bum chase keeps saying next years qb class is loaded when in actuality it’s a bunch of mid YT dudes 😭🚮
Mike McCarthy was a horrible coach he was neck & neck with jason Garrett. We have a better coaching staff we can wait till week 4-5 to start making claims. We have the players to open a better versatile playbook. Dak will build chemistry and learn Pickens needs & wants as he does with lamb. He will feed the 50/50 balls to George as he did with gallup & Amari.
also dak has been getting hurt lately not like he is prone to it, but he gets major season ending injuries, he needs to stay healthy to even have a shot
That punk to the left of the screen hates dak for nothing. Everything is always a back hand compliment. Dak did nothing to this man but yet he always have some negative to say
Eagles fan mad😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Dem Boyz coming, no worries. We ain’t even going to say too much this season.
Dakota still QB 😂 it don't matter .
Brain Shot don't miss 😂
Of all the YouTube videos, my favorite is anything that doesn't have Stephen A. vomiting his Cowboys Derangement Syndrome.
Shady is a hater. Dak owns Hurts, Shady. Eagles have had a better team last few years..... we'll see how this year pans out. 😏
pickens isnt a 5 game difference maker the move will look even better tho because dallas has a 3rd place schedule
Cowboys will still disappoint their fans lol. Wonder what Joy is wearing today?
Thank you Shady for keeping it real
Yesss yesss begin instilling hope in cowboys fans. We now begin the 2025-26 cowboys cycle of hope leading to eventual dread. Love it
15:07 you must can tell the future Chase because next year QBs haven’t taken a NFL snap yet 🤔
Not even close to the Eagles
Damn Shady, did Dak steal your girl or something? The HATE seems VERY PERSONAL 🤔🤔🤔
Shady a hater. It's always about Dak to him. Dak's better than Hurysy, Shady. Period.
Cowboys are still the 3rd best team in the division
Shady face says it all. HE TIGHTTTTT!!! lmbo
I'm waiting for Dallas fans to proclaim the Cowboys going to the Superbowl after this trade lfg 🔥
Knew this would happen haha , pickens comments on the weekend got him canned , Cowboys have fun haha
When the team loses in the playoffs, it's not just because of #4, the narratives are sad and getting old
Time for Lamb to eat
🧢
Stop with this nonsense. Cowboys will be fighting with the Giants for the basement in the NFC East.
Cowboys defense was never phenomenal. We could not stop the run. Yes dak Played bad against the packers. However The defense set the tone with letting Aaron Jones run wild on them.
I am being greedy rn but I still want Nick Chubb Amari Cooper Stephon Gillmore Erick Kendricks Johnathan Hankins I'll be confident
They still ain’t getting out they division
Shady is right! When CD only gets 8 targets what do you think is going to happen 😂😂 Brian wants to run the ball more 😂😂 GL
I respect former players knowledge on football so something that has been bugging me is the hype of next years Qb draft class. I haven’t seen it yet with Any of the potential Qbs.
Pickens one of the better blocking WRs too. Great Move Jerrrr!
Preach Shady
Jerry will remain Jerry Jones so nice addition but Cowboys will end the year at home again 😂
Stop this Mr. McCoy. Literally every chance he gets to throw dirt on Daks name, he does. Disregarded the regression of Cooks as well as the terrible offensive scheme, yet remembered it for Hurts when they (The Eagles) struggled a couple years back. Dallas repeatedly learned about the better back halfway through seasons when everyone else has pointed it out in CAMP. Shady is entertaining and that's about it.
Shady on fire again!
How is George Pickens worth 3-4 extra wins????? I think it’s a great move for Dallas don’t get me wrong, but if you thought they’d win 7-8 games, how does Pickens get them to 11-12????
Did he just say a top balanced offense, still need to see them be able to run the ball first
Joe Burrow has hella help and so does Herbert most of his career and Trevor too. Where is this energy for them  James went on a rant last year about how Burrow needs more help
Dak must owe Shady money, or stole a girlfriend back in the day. I’m a Cowboys fan who is very irritated with Dak. Shady moving real suspicious. Just saying
Leave it to the Steelers to get a 3rd round pick for one of the best 50/50 receivers in the league. Learn how to control your talented wide receivers. 🎉
Who's the QB, Dak?   1, 2, 3 cancun
He can run fast and catch - that's it. If the play isn't designed for him, then he loses interest real quick. He won't run secondary routes that get others open, he won't block, he won't tackle if there's a turnover, he gets frustrated and commits dumb penalties that cost his team. I'm glad the Cowboys have him.
Shady has the best Dak takes
All that talent just to go one & done in the playoffs at best
It’s the SAME THING EVERY OFF SEASON 😂
Even with this trade cowboys are third in the division
To be fair jerry put together a decent squad over years just the qb and defense folds against them play off teams
Shady again sounding like a jaded lover lol
Defense against packers?
Ima Cowboys fan, mind you I used to HATE that mf Shady but now I understand what he be saying even tho he be juicing it a lil, Dak gotta stay consistent man
Shady is mad
They have all that , just to go one and done in the playoffs 🤣
Mike gave away his headache.  He's gonna stretch Dak In the parking lott.
They went and got Miles sanders smh
It’s the cowboys. They gonna stink it up yet again, for the 31st year in a row😂😂😂🫵🫵🫵
Life long cowboys fan here. And i really really hate to say this but i agree with shady for once. Think i threw up in my mouth a bit 😂
The glaring red flag is the Steelers gave up on him early
Dallas Get One Player Who is a Mild content and all the sudden "Jerry Cooking" 😂😂 soon as Dak Throw a few Picks to "PICKENS" that boy gone crash out and let Dak know how Trash he is and Him and Micah Gone Talk about it on his Podcast. Y'all called T.O. A locker room headache I can't Wait to see what y'all call this YN.
Cowboyz still garbage
They'll still be fighting with the Giants for 3rd place in the division
Last time I checked Dak don't tackle.
James Jones brought up Dez Bryant 700 ('16) & 800 ('17) yds but didn't know Dez missed about 11 games between those two seasons & wasnt the same after breaking his foot in 2016..
I said the moment they finally fired McCarthy that Dallas was automatically going to be a contender because their biggest weakness was now gone and I think people who didn't quite watch as close as I have will soon see how much coach McCarthy actually held them back even before this trade I had them at 10 possibly 11 wins but now I'm going to up that one more and say 11 possibly 12 wins
Man Shady must sincerely got something against Dak. I have never seen a grown man talk about another grown man like this each and every year. Geesh. Let it go bru
Its gonna be some great battles in the nfc east this year!
Well the eagles have all that and more 🤷🏾
Pickens is a problem and a lot of them will show up. Shady is the only one speaking the truth.
Dak’s downfall with this offense will need a documentary
NFC east gonna be the most well rounded division in the league this season. Dallas just made things very interesting... They still stink, but interesting nonetheless. 🦅💪
Dak must’ve smashed shadys wife the way he talks about him lol.
Let's see if Pickens can play and not stand around on the field every other play
Let’s keep it Real Dak is just a black Kirk cousins.. smh
Now we NEED DAK TO GET TF UP OUTA HERE AND GET A NEW QB
If Dak stays healthy, this is a great move. All comes down to Dak. People can stop acting like this isn't a great move.
Real question is, will Dallas pay Pickens $30M+
Shaddyyy scareedddd!
Acho literally just described the Baltimore Ravens offense 😂
OCHO WITH THE EARLY MORNING GIBBERISH 😂
They ackin like Dallas the only team in the NFL
I think it's safe to assume most people, including the guys at the desk, only watched highlights and didn't actually watch the Steelers' games. If Pickens isn't being fed consistently, he might as well not even be on the field, and that won't happen with Ceedee out there.
Ima Cowboy Fan and it doesn't matter what we get if we don't have a QB to throw to them 😂😂😂😂 Dak is hot garbage
shady be hatin😭
They still gone suck lol 😂
Shady is keeping it real 4 sure.
I predict Pickens will get frustrated with Dak and the camera will be there to catch it 😂
Cowboys still trash 🚮 the Broncos R up next superbowl champs 🏆
I'll name you a team Acho. The tampa bay buccaneers, have it all,  yet nobody seems to ever mention them
Now you got 2 High Ego WR with a High Ego QB. Dak personality won't work, he needs elite WR who are extremely humble.
why is he on this show shady
Chase has said the QB room next draft is stacked 1,000 times and has never named one guy.
If your the Steelers why wouldnt you do this pre draft 😏
Asking Shady to say something good about Dak is like a Demoncrat saying something good about Trump.
Ain't nobody worried about the cowgirls, this the same team that had 9 all pro and got smacked by the youngest team in the nfl in the packers.
How they going to pay Micah and GP
PICKENS = PROBLEM coming.  We will see how well they contain him.  Lol!  Off the field and on the field "ANTICS" will come up brah.  Trust me...as a Steelers fan there is no doubting is talent, but he is going to be a problem.  Pickens doesn't even complete his routes when he knows he's not getting the ball.  JUST WAIT!
The cowboys will be last in there division. Go Birdssss 🦅
Good for us in Baltimore
Shady terrified
Thata cool Eagles still better 🤣❤️ finally some competition
Nobody can be mad at this trade, it’s a win/win for Dallas short term and long term. U either get your wr2 after the season if they sign him back or u get a 3rd round comp pick if they choose to let him walk.
Dak is still going to choke😂
As a Dallas fan I just want them have some success before I die😅😅😅😅. All seriously Dak needs to go down cauze Milton would be better for team. Dak will never win the big game
Dak was all pro not too long ago and runner up for the MVP.
Brandin Cooks is old
My boy dak still going to be throwing tha ball to tha other teams 😢😅go cowboys doe 🎉
If dak sell this he might not wear a Dallas uniform again😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Cowboys aint sh!t
Still don't see where the running game is coming from. Rbbc doesn't always mean a successful rushing attack.
I get it, it's the Cowboys. Every move is headline news. Every day is a new drama. Literally yesterday the story was that the lockers got rearranged. I think Pickens is nice sure. But come on he isn't season changing nice. Good addition and he helps Lamb but I'm not going to jump off a bridge and start calling them a Superbowl team because of a WR2
Stop the Cap!!!😂
The facility 😊
This tells me Tomlin and Steelers quietly tanking cause they know Rodgers ain't coming...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I mean i see the plan but they still won't compete with the top 5 teams in thr nfc. Pickens is not a bad dude. Eagles quinyon mitchell locked them both up Pickens and lamb.. also not to mention their oline is still questionable and we won't even talk about that defense. But congrats I guess
They defense still won't be able to stop the run. Good move at wr though
The Philadelphia Eagles
Ain't nobody worried about the Cowboys run game or defense.
The cowboys are what Shady calls Dak🤣🤣 if you know you know....Go Birds!
Shady is just an eagle bro he hating
Im not a fan of Pickens mindset/maturity but a 3rd rounder is NOTHING. Hopefully he can grow up
Dysfunctional team all day
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
The DT tackle postion and LB and head coach still all question marks
Over Under 2.5 Acho saying 255 Years Of NFL Experience Meat riding Superbowl winning cohost💀💔
Steph doing what LeBum failed to do. Steph is a winner and doesn't make excuses.   Steph is 3-1 v LeBum in the NBA finals, facts. With a 5th ring Curry will be the undisputed GOAT of this generation.
