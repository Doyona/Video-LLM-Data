I remember watching this on election night. It was so funny watching Kornacki get cut off right at the end before he could even acknowledge that Trump won the election. Eleven and a half hours of coverage only to be cut off by your own network. Congratulations MSNBC, take a bow 🙇‍♀️

6:40:10 if Trump wins he got this
A night to remember. Historic indeed. Steve, the only breath of fresh air at MSNBC that night.
Thanks screwtube. I can't see one reply to any comment. Enjoying being filthy censors??
Once Kornacki announced that Milwaukee did not generate enough votes to make a difference in Wisconsin, the feed ended abruptly a few short seconds later.   This ended the overt cheerleading session for Harris and the Democrats.
4:21:27
Such an embarrassing night for America
MsNBC, a strange channel called otobus, is cut and pasting your reports, then dubbing in different vocals. I have no idea who they are, represent etc. Anyway, heads up about that site. It came up on my mobile all by itself, no input from me.
3:15:06 diversifying just means non White. Like how the NBA is 99.9% black but somehow the NBA is diverse…
Here for the meltdown
1/5/2025: THIS WAS A DISAPPOINTING AND HEARTBREAKING LOSS FOR KAMALA HARRIS AND TIM WALZ, THEIR ENTIRE CAMPAIGN STAFF AND THEIR 75 MILLION SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT AMERICA. KAMALA HARRIS AND TIM WALZ WERE THE HEAVY FAVORITES TO WIN THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION (THEY LEAD IN SOME NATIONAL POLLS WHILE OTHER POLLS WERE TIED) . AND DONALD TRUMP AND J.D. VANCE WERE THE UNDERDOGS. HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL HAVE THEIR FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT. IT COULD BE A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN. IT MIGHT HAPPEN 10 YEARS FROM NOW. OR 20 YEARS FROM NOW. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD LEARN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE WOMEN HAVE FINALLY SHATTERED THE GLASS CEILING: CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM (MEXICO), DINA BOLUARTE (PERU), GIORGIA MELONI (ITALY), ANGELA MERKEL (GERMANY), VIOLETA BARRIOS DE CHAMORRO (NICARAGUA), MICHELLE BACHELET (CHILE), CORAZON AQUINO (THE PHILIPPINES),  ISABEL PERON (ARGENTINA), MARGARET THATCHER (GREAT BRITAIN), GOLDA MEIR (ISRAEL), INDIRA GANDHI (INDIA), ETC., ETC.
I'm a Pennsylvania voter voted for Trump it really didn't matter about Michigan and Wisconsin all  Donald Trump really needed was Alaska and the one electoral vote in Maine and Nebraska Arizona would have put him over Nevada want to put him over they act like it all hinge on Wisconsinl
10:04:39 He’s trying so hard when he knows the election is over and Trump has won!! 😢😢😂😂😂
Notice how he blabbed less and  less as the night went on about how Kamala had chances county by county statistically.
9:29:28 That’s vodka 😂😂😂
8:05:36 Kornacki realizing that Trump won Pennsylvania and thus the election! 😂😂😂😂
7:56:05 Kornacki in the bathroom crying. 😂😂😂😂
Kornacki just as bad as the rest of MSNBC.
Freedom loving people win.   Communists lose.
Everyone in comments senses Kornacki a decent man. He does a great job but knew hours earlier the network was forcing him to infantilize results for the 'viewers' (as record few as there were).  British oddsmakers had called the race MANY hours earlier. How often have British oddsmakers (professional betting parlors not pollsters per se) been wrong about U.S. Presidential elections? Never.
It is December 11, and I am watching this enjoyable night again - what a pleasure !
they can't get away from pa
Dont you just love democracy and OUR right to vote!!
Im sad we dont have a record of Jen Psakis meltdown
Someday Steve my hope for you is to work for a network and just report the facts without the channels narrative and bias put forth before you.
Lol. Trump!
Thank you MSNBC for being the most biased liberal media network on the planet 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 You truly are the gift that keeps on giving👌🏾
Interesting! AI comes out a few year ago and Elon and the big tech bros support Trump... suddenly all the comments are pro big business, pro Republican. Riiiiiiight. No chance the comment section is flooded with AI bots supporting Trump because he will reduce taxes for billionaires... riiiiiiiight. LOL
MSNBC: Pure propaganda,almost cero journalism, a bunch of lies from a bunch of liers except Steve! 😢OMG!Democrats don't know how american people think anymore
God i just had to come back to watch the shock on your faces as you got absolutely wrecked! So much fun
Steve is what the journalist should be. You give fact and data. no bias or opinion
This video helps me sleep at night !!
Why does joy reid not want to be seen with progressive white women? Why does joy reid tell us to avoid our families?
Completely fake news, all wrong in hindsight.  They deliberately pedal false information based on political bias.
Congratulations you guys lost, just remember don’t lies, we are the people not like you think, we are smarter ❤❤❤
The ending... Omg the ending... This poor man had been streaming for 11.5 hours straight, and at the last moment as he says "Donald Trump will be the next President-Ele...."  they cut the stream.
Bro the reason trump did not do anything catastrophic in his first term was that he had guardrails that he will not have in his second term.
Just doing some math here... There was a moment when Trump was up by 109,336 votes in Wisconsin with 96% of the votes counted. He ended up winning the state by a total of 29,417 votes. Therefore, of the remaining 4% of the votes that were counted, Kamala got 70% of those votes. Does anyone else think this is odd? The only explanation is that ALL of those remaining votes came from Dane and Milwaukee counties, and virtually nothing from any other county in the state. Weird.
Waited 4 long years for these 😊and I am ENJOYING IT 😉 SO MUCH 👍 ❤
I'm gonna miss this guy flapping his arms up and down like a demented eagle!!!
Wow, Trump kicked some a$$.
The issue with Democrat voters is that they allow their leaders to deceive them, and their MSNBC, CNN, ABC network misleads them into believing that Kamala is winning the presidential election but it was not even close.
I could watch this over and over and over again.Congratulations my great president trump
Breaking up the department of education wouldn’t strip funds or power from the agency. The agency gets given back to the states for crap sakes. Simple division here people.
NBC whatever you want to say about them has by far the best election music
I love his reaction to Pennsylvania being called....
I really hope Elon keeps Kornacki when he buys MSNBC.😂 Only one worth keeping. Of course, he'd probably keep Joy Reid for the LOLs.
You democrats need to come to the realization that you're all just a bunch of elitists that don't give a c*** about ordinary people. All you want is power and wealth and will say anything and do anything to get it. And that is the main reason why you lost the election.  You know it!!!
Steve please leave this disgrace 😢 You are too good here Others are just plain clowns 😢😢😢
Now that MSNBC is up for sale, wouldn’t it be hysterical if Elon Musk ended up buying MSNBC and fired all these overpaid woke left wing radical liars, and turned it into a real news network?
Hes the only one on this televised mental institution who you cant tell who he supports personally. Just gives the facts and info as it comes in.
What a great night it was! Inauguration Day needs to hurry. Don’t need Joe screwing things up even more than he has!
Next election I just want to watch and listen to Karnacki. (Without the annoying music and TV personalities)
Kornacki you and the rest are gone
"Too close to call" and then results come in as a modern day landslide
MSNBC is being sold and changing its name… to MSRIP
Just a matter of time before this pathetic network is off the air....
They knew in 5 hours, but didn't call it.
This guy is a farse, he used polling that ONLY showed pro Harris results leading up to build hype around her base... He never claimed RCP had Trump winning almost every battleground state.
Bye, bye MSNBC.  I'm just so thankful common sense won when now President Trump won.  This makes me really enthused.  ❤
That guy is pretty good, because he's data-oriented, not emotion-oriented.
Steve kornacki just the best no bias no agenda just numbers.
Watching President Trump's Massive Landslide Blowout Re-election Victory on MSNBC Over and Over again is a Total Delight!!!   👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸👍🤗🇺🇸
11 hours of denial and cope.
There were 155 million votes in 2020, and it looks like there will be 151 million votes in 2024. So what happened to 4 million votes? The most critical election in our lifetime and 4 million voters decided to sit this one out?
They edited the live coverage how nice. I can’t wait for your media license to get pulled. Bye bye gravy train hello lawsuits.
MSNBC- Rearranging seats on the Titanic.
What happened? Why cut it short after 11 hours? Refusing to include the final call.. Pathetic!
Traitors
Funny how liberal msnbc took down the coverage of election night 2024 of the liberal democrat news anchors comments now Americans what's that tell you about msnbc wake up America
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great Donald Trump, congratulations and greetings from Italy
Have to say, MSN is horrible, but Kornacki is a gem.
The network is up for sale to the highest bidder. Elon will buy it hopefully.
Imagine being the guy that has to tell the freaks they are gonna lose badly
WE LOVE TRUMP❤❤❤❤
Wasn’t it msnbc who in previous years wouldn’t even call President Trump by name, preferring to call him “the former guy”. This must be painful 😬
Woke media  house 🏠
I would like to take this opportunity to thank MSNBC, CNN, Hollywood, academia, and above all, the DNC for getting Trump elected.  Thanks. You may have just saved our country !  MAGA baby 2024     🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Magically Delicious.
Thank you MSNBC for being so obviously far left liberal and full of propaganda that it made it easy for me to vote Republican this year
TRUMP ❤TRUMP ❤TRUMP
love the headshaking at 7:59
Glorious Night in American History!
Dislikes are 3-1 over likes! No one Relevant cares about you MSNBC. You're ratings show that but you are too ignorant to know the difference! We're the captain now! NEXT~
MSNBC NEEDS THEIR LICENSE REVOKED FOR SPEWING CONSTATNT B.S. !!!!!!!
There are no more blue states!!! Just blue cities! Yeah
Lol
What is his fixation on previous elections? Who is the audienc he’s trying to reach?
where is the panel video..?
Send this goofball back to reporting on hurricanes.  He is out of his league in race horses and politics.
I turned msnbc off on election night to avoid the most irritating person that appears on that cable outlet, Steve Kornacki.
A nerd (meant as a compliment) like this with access to this kind of data must have known VERY early that Trump was going to win.
Kornacki is a treasure every election.  That man can work that board and run those numbers fair and honest.  He should have his own election night show.
😂😅😂🎉
What a glorious and historic night! The smell of sweet success! Thank you to all you political pundit haters, race baiters, misogynistic, hitler bashing narcissists! You helped him get elected! Forever grateful to all of you! Please seek mental health practitioners! God Bless America BTW an early Merry Christmas! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😁
Msnbc is so pathetic. Stopping the stream before he could say elect. The whole team at msnbc id trash journalists. They are a joke of a news station. But they do provide entertainment on election days when they lose. But other than that, the lowest of low in the news industry.
Who is listening to these lying liars that lie?
This is actually comedy gold.
I like Steve, wish he was on FOX News.  His the only reason I tune into MSNBC on election night - but only for a short time.
If Steve has a job by the end of year would surprise me.
MSM really thought a comedians joke was going to turn an election to the Democrats! That’s how delusional they all were…. Again!
This network is pro-democrat, right?  The democrat party is not supposed to be racist, right?  Why in the world would this network employ joy Reid a super racist?
Trump 2024!!
MSNBC are kooks
Worst election coverage I have EVER witnessed.
Their fixation on college degrees is laughable.
Watching their reaction to Pennsylvania made my day.. From harris harris harris harris to.... Oh Trump.
Not one mention of the blue turning red in Georgia until very late on.
No republicans went to bed this time. No way they could find millions of votes under the table.
Were they really that delusional early on?
Trump already got Pennsylvania he really didn't need Wisconsin or Michigan Arizona or Nevada would have put him over
I don't like msnbc but steve is the man!
Harris should demand a hand recount of ALL ballots cast in swing states, to make sure there were no irregularities.
Socialism is the rise of tyrants and censorship.
What is the phenomenon of Trump's victory? In my opinion, it is emigration. Migrants as biological weapons were deliberately sent at the right moments. Remember the migration of Syrians to Europe. Russia took the most active part together with Turkey. Russia bombed the cities of Syria, fueling the migration. Domestic politicians of Europe, like Merkel, played along with the migration. In the US, the same picture is - migration from Mexico. Who stimulated the flow of migrants to the US? Look for the Russian trace inside the countries - donors of migrants, fueling the movement in the US. I am curious, will Palestinian activists in the US continue their rallies? Pay attention to a number of crimes of migrants before the elections in the US and the dissemination of these crimes in the media. The same processes will happen in Europe. The right will come to power in Europe and the stimulation of Asian migrants has now heated up in the Netherlands with Jewish pogroms through dissemination in the media and social networks. Twitter, bought by Musk before the elections for unknown billions, is also a factor influencing the US elections.
Where's the actual video of your babies crying?
GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP
Oh trust us, Pres Trump's supporters will be returning to this often!!!!
Steve Connacki can't explain what what happened on Nov 5, if anything, he should raise doubts. We don't want explanations, we want justice and our voices Heard. The word on the streets is that something had to happen happened in order to get the results we got. Everyone that I know and have come across said they voted for Kamala Harris. They said, she had their vote of confidence that Harris would not become a terrorist and rise to power by the cry of the people. The news say otherwise, that everyone run to select a terrorist. Who's planing to become the government and many are with him. Just look at the Shameless Elon Musk, he himself an immigrant, is treating  the migrant community like trash, just like Trump. You see, migrants can't by their citizenship, they are send to their place of origin where nothing will happen, it will become an impossible dream. Is Donald Trump telling the 4 winds, Elon Musk doesn't have the right to be here, he's Infectious and only God knows what kind of Viruses he's carrying. Even the terrible Musk is peddling same hateful rhetoric. The Billionaires can buy a country...
Gotcha!
The only reason this has views because americans wanna watch you fake reporter's cry. Your not reporters because you dont talk facts through journalism. You talk your very bias one sided opinion, manipulate truth to the point its lies, and are histerical in your bias opinions. Thats never been journalism. Its why your time representing news is very limited
The real hero of the evening :)
Wow!!!! What a LANDSLIDE VICTORY ❤️❤️🐿️ Millions and millions of new Black and Hispanic votes!
That background music is awful, poor guy trying to think with that in the background. I would go bonkers
Kuku land. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kornacky is a clown. I don't believe this guy
Kornacki is the hardest working man at MSNBC... which isn't saying much considering that most of them just sit around and bellyache like the Morning Psycho.... but still..... the man knows his political numbers.  Great job!
Kornacki, you're the only sane person on msnbc. How do you cope with the nonstop crazy?
You messed up again  neck and neck ? Just give up the day job mate. You are truly bad at it
Enjoying watching the meltdown of these networks
For MSNBC to cut Kornacki, who did a superb job of explaining what was happening in each individual state, when they got the news that Trump won PA is absurd, irrational, and petty, to say the least.  Shame on you MSNBC!
someone better save this before they take it off again like in 2016
5:36:41 North Carolina, 6:35:06 Georgia, 8:05:05 Pennyslvania
The gradual meltdowns!!  I love it!!  😂😂😂😂
MSNBC is a sick joke overall, but I really enjoy watching Steve Kornacki’s analysis. He’s the best!
been looking forward to thin since 2017 lol
Let’s be honest, we all were excited for the election just for this video.
Kornacki, you are great man. Please leave this disgraceful network.
Is there somewhere to watch the "real" MSNBC election night stream?
Kornacki you were very good achor to listen to this election night. Hopefully see you in 4 years :)
Steve is the only one that I can listen to in this channel
It’s fun watching someone work when they obviously love their job. He’s totally geeking out.
Mr Pastor Sir, your assignment is the PREACH to word of GOD Sir. No to PICK WHICH PARTY to vote for. Most of you Pastors have your own private agenda.  I will it there! You are spreading hate and judging people.  The same Bible you read said the only GOD IS JUDGE. Judge not less he be JUDGE. Your assignment is the pray for people to draw near to GOD Mr Pastor Sir.
🤣🤣🤣 Trump Trump Trump 👏🏻👏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Give this man a chair at least
Steve Kornacki: "If Trump is declared the winner in Wisconsin that's 10 electoral votes he will officially, mathematically, cross the 270 threshold to become, mathematically the President ele..." *get cut off*. Way to go MSNBC.😒 They did you dirty Steve, but you did a great job.😊👍
MSNBC you are humanity’s #1 enemy! The lies you spew could one day cause a civil war! Just so tankful Trump won!🇺🇸
Michelle Obama for president in 2028... 🫶🏻
Where's the other MSNPC stream?
I really want to keep streaming this but your background music sounds like I'm suiting up for war.
Good and hard work from Steve Kornacki through the night and in the weeks preceding. Hope he gets a good rest after all this
I can’t get out of the bed…It’s over
The end of demoncrazy
TRUMP 2024😂😂😂😂
Worst bias station in the entire WORLD. Joy Reid go run with that . Your wannabe President can’t even concede defeat. Because of the non stop hatred and blatant lies you all supported.Sadder bunch now 😢😂😂
Now we know The View , Morning Joe, Meadow were a bunch of wrong idiots....Now where is your Kamala last night....
Where is Kamala...
Do you have anything to say?
I cannot believe we are here again despite all that has happened. The democrats need to reflect on how they failed and those who supported Trump are in for another rude awakening. Choices have consequences, more than ever
you know why I'm here
Prove to me there has been NO interference from Russia....
Funny how hard he was egging votes on in his mind and telegraphing by his language.  Goofballs, and with college educations!
2016 all over again, let the replays and tears flow. I love it
She needs a Drink, no wait she just finished a bottle!
She can always crawl back under Willie "black snake" Brown's desk!
Thank you America. You’ve saved the western world and we truly appreciate it. You may hate him but watch him end all these wars before March once he enters In January
198O where the United States maintain low cost to keep at the lowest minimum wage for forty years. The United States of America military earned $0.75 an hour 1972 while it would always be the fraudulent influence invaded hijacked Hitler's KGB criminals pushed the game scheme war crimes with feeding the American people being #1 and Homeland safe while the idolize Hitler's Trump's and Ronald Reagan remove the intolerable Berlin wall and opened the doors of the United States of America to the world of different people who had not truly lived by or fully practiced real religion while Billy Graham would come across as the complex engine to connect and help take down the safety guardrails of the United States of America with people filled with unlimited aiding abetting catastrophic corruption throughout the world 🌍 😎
Republicans successfully suppressed millions of votes. Trump said he had a secret, and this is it. Harris must not accept this FAKE result. Exit polls said preserving democracy is #1 issue. That isn’t Republicans’ values. They want a republic. Where did those votes go?!
The USA is now a colony of Putin´s Rusia.  Europe is alone, it will have to reactivate that dormant DNA of Germany;   and this time, for a change, that DNA has to be in the right side of History.
LONG LIVE THE KING !!!!!
Msnbc on standby 😂
They honestly cand win fairly, so theey feloniously bribe ...
With the brobery cheating, why bother counting, the repubs obviously will cheat by their bribery for vites to win, and thats more fellonies they cmmited
This Biden administration needs too be looked into and prosecuted for subverting our democracy and the people. God Bless America
Shame on you@ fake news!!!
The news 🙏🏻 🥀🗞️🌹🥀 media/did not over jump 🦘 the prediction  of the presidential race/they strictly said, that if Trump wanted to come down from that beautiful ❤️🥀❤️❤️🥀 hotel of his in Florida , then the news media could not 🛑 stop Trump 🍁 or his family for coming down and Trump making his victory speech/however the media did not call it, because Trump had not quite won 🥀❤️🥀🕊️ the 270 mark ❣️🥀
Look at that red!!
Amazing the Deceit MSNBC portrays. Last night, Steve Kornacki kept pushing DEMOCRACY as being the biggest concern of the American People @ 900PM last night, this morning the same chart is saying it's THE ECONOMY. Stop pushing your liberal narrative & just report the news.
the salt mine is open, boys!
MSNBC's panel of 17 "election experts" all "predicted" a Harris win. That shows how out of touch the extreme leftists at MSNBC are.
The PEOPLE have spoken!!!!!
Well that first day dictator should be interesting to watch. Shut down the border by executive order; call it an invasion he’s defending the country against. Then jerking the licenses from all media outlets he considers enemies of the state. Probably start banning Muslims from public office and start deportations. Etc, Etc, ………on with the Haitians next and LBGTQ NEXT, denying rights guaranteed under the constitution for all citizens. Well he will decide who fits and who doesn’t. Enact the Project 2025.
Time to change networks, Komacki. Great job, sir.
Oh well, it seems comedians will have 4 more years of material.
This is the most racist and corrupt country on earth. They put a rich criminal in the white house...ONLY IN AMERICA😕
😂MAGA
Que mucho vamos a llorar que vergüenza de los supuesto Puertorriqueños como se tiraron la soga al cuello latinos
That's what money will do for you? He paid to win!
All this time Trump has figured a way since 2020 him and Republicans has placed and manipulated the swing states for trump, if u paid attention, he told u in so many bites, that he had a plan with the house speaker, and his maga followers perform the cheating that u couldn't know about, it was behind closed doors when y'all thought he had disappeared for a few days, they knew the electoral was in they're favor a month ago, FYI, he stole it, he didn't play fair from the middle of his campaign, so Dems u gonna have to figure out where the dark spot you all miss, it looked clean for a race but it wasn't, figure it out, cause I'm not saying!!!
Came here to see kornacki squirm all night😂😂
Poor Camel Heels Up Harris 😂
The project 2025 voters have lost what minds they ever had.
I’m a longtime Democrat and I voted for Donald J Trump because of people like Joey Reid
I’m a longtime Democrat and I voted for Donald J Trump because of people like Joey Reid
Fake media 💩
He is having a breakdown
America has lost its mind! We are heading for a depression like we’ve never seen before!!
Sorry to see Tester lose. He was one of the few GOOD Democrats but we need to control the border and Tester may be unreliable now. If you don't know John Tester saved us from the amnesty Bush wanted to push through the Senate in a lame duck sessiona as he was going out. Unfortunately, Tester had to side with the Democrats to get campaign money so was compromised.
Mathematically the president, lol
go to sleep, steve. its done.
America  never ceases  to disappoint  me.
I really don’t know why people are surprised. America has always been a racist, misogynistic, fascist country.  And whatever happen America deserves everything that’s coming. And to all the idiots who voted against their own interests I’m cheering with you😂 both parties are a joke and so is a America 😂😂😂
Well, he has won. So to all my dear American friends, it’s time to think about what it means to be American.
*This could be a Landslide!*
THIS IS THE BIGGEST VOTING FRAUD IN AMERICA SYSTEM. THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, IMPOSSIBLE. THAT HATE AND DIVISION WON IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Congratulations America. A beautiful day for the ' ordinary'  Americans, a dreadful and dark day for Hollywood and the media. Let the tears flow !
In Poker we call this a Royal Flush.
Africa stand for Trump 2024,under him before the world was at peace but today under this kamala the universe smells WW3,ukraine is a graveyard today thanks to biden and kamala.
Not enough vans loaded with phoney postal votes at 3am could steal the election this time!
I can't wait to see the next Bill Maher show.
Watching MSNBC psychotics live is the best comedy I have ever seen. Should I be ashamed making fun of these mental defectives?
Here comes Putin
Dems lost because Harris is a woman and a woman of color.😢
If it was ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN, this would have just been mere disappointment.  The fact we're outraged says a LOT more about trump than all his cult followers realize. There has GOT to be a cheat in there somewhere, that's all I'm thinking.  trump's conned before.  He'd do anything to stay out of jail like a wuss.
Modern women lost 😅🤣🤣
Rachel Maddow was probably waking up crying to the news. Hahaha. We’re coming for you. We fooled you all we’re coming for you.
If Trump had been to China 30 times would MSNBC be as neutral as they are with Walz?
Steve has been taking Adderall or smoking crack all night long. He's been talking a million miles an hour all night and onto this morning on Morning Joe.
Funny how he just casually slips out of frame. Is this Satire?
🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂wokies
Whatever happens I hope the electoral college is happy. When the crap hits the fan remember you put him in office
We’re in trouble with this man
Comcast just announced MSNBC is for sale. Hmmmm, coincidence?
Where are all those imbeciles who used to chant 4 more years whenever people protested the war?
TIME TO TRASH THAT WOKE STATE OF MIND. BRING SANITY BACK TO AMERICA MR TRUMP
Trump 2024 i voted for biden in 2020 not this time. Hey democrats i guess your DEI hire didn't work out too well. These broadcasters are so out of touch with reality. And of course we are all racist and bigots who don't want a woman for president. These people are insufferable
Trump is your President
Where is the cackling clown that lost the election?
😂😂😂😂😂😂 sorry lgbtq family all your wakiness is gone
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
For Peanut. ❤❤❤
Such a shame that the dirt bag lowlife democrat party LOST!
GABBARD RUBIO 2028
See whaaa haa happen is 😢😢😢
We bathe in liberal tears 😂
Take a seat STEVE.  TRUMP MAGA WE GOT THIS !!!!!!!!!!!
Have you booked your U-Haul to Canada yet??🤣
😊😊
Americans are not ready for a female president despite all that is at stake....
😂😂😂WOKEies your such clowns
Total Landslide Victory to the Republicans
Way to remain unbiased and neutral.
Everything Korny says is complete BS. How does he even have a job? 😅
Semper Fi, President Trump! That phrase is normally reserved for US Marines, but I just made an exception!
I feel like an American again and not like a condemned human. Thanks for Trump
There is a lot that was missed. Not debunking gender change in schools and forgiving student debt in my opinion was a horrible decision.
Sad day for democracy in America.
🤡 👈 Democrats: BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!😂😂😂😂
To the news media thank you so much for your democracy support! You just lost it for us!
Defund the media. Make news unbiased again and get rid of corrupt access journalism.
HARRIS LOST BIGLY!!!  CONGRATS MR PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! IT WAS TO BIG TO RIG THIS TIME
I'm beginning to feel unburdened from what has been.  Let the leftist psychotic freak out begin!  My popcorn is cooked with bacon.
Really smart move replacing Biden with a rabid harpy who's as popular as fart soup.
They’re doing it again, 5am they cut the feed
This is the best! Our Constitutional Republic is saved.
Forget d analysis.  It's ovr.
Hahahahaha maga baby
11:29:29  They did it again, but at 5am instead of 4am 😂😂😂 cheaters
This is freaking hilarious😆😆😆
SOOOOOO JOYFULLLL JOY JOY harris lost BIG BIG
By the time they forced Biden out there want enough time to switch the names on all the forged ballots from Biden to Harris. That was the deciding factor
MAGA MAGA
Trump won lol Kamala Harris your fired take shumer,biden and that evil hag pelosi with you to baracks house for tea, tears and cookies!
No more license for MSNDC and their lies. It's over for all these state ran media liars. Finally. It OVER . NO MORE Trans teaching kids,.no more invasion  No more weird left ideology. Leave all you lefties.
Hahaha their live chat is off 😂😂😂😂😂who is laughing now  😂😂😂😂😂😂
It amazes me how on earth she still managed so many votes???
Hello msnc news.i just turned in so i could watch you all crying.congrets.Donald Trump 😂😂😂
American should investigate very well, I do think trump won
u may be against trump but ive done my research and im no fool, simple common sense is what y'all lack, creating problems and playing victims is what u do best, all u did was playing blame games, calling names instead of focusing on integrity and humility, i can say kamala would win if she trully wanted but she threw it away, so your fault🤷‍♂  Honestly the blatant lies from some news including u makes u no diff from what's going on in North Korea LIES LIES LIES i wouldnt be surprised if u called democrats gods and pure hearted yet abortion is supported im a guy and i know the consequences of nutting in a girl so everyone needs to avoid silly mistakes that may cause harm to people   finally no one is perfect dont act like a saint
We love you, President Trump
God help America, what have you done putting this madman at the helm???😢
Well well ! MAGA took out the trash!!
Now im am ugly dumb broke b*tch but didnt all these ppl use my life to make billions. Yeah doesn't seem legal and will be resolved quickly and correctly given who else is not on board with that. Now they are saying im genie and the goal was to lock me up and abusee every way they could and elevate these rappers a d my brother and sports stars so id be dependent and stupid whoch is what was playing out until recently
HAHAHA one Flamer left in the newsroom of lies..... TAKE THAT MSNBC!
Every platform is saying trump won how, this is bad news I can't believe, a convicted criminal leading America very shameful
shame shame on u fake reports and analysis
I hope the media becomes accountable for all the fake news we will remember
The only kamala speech i want to see now is her admission of defeat. Im tuning in for that satisfaction.
He is the greatest con man to ever exist. How did Kamala get approximately 12 fewer million votes than Biden when the population has grown by nearly 10 million meaning about 6-7 million more voters were eligible?
never mind me.  i am only here to laugh at you.
your ever leading kamala and fake analysis and reporting is betraying your station
GO THAT WAY or I'll die or what are we doing? Gunpoint for 11 years not legal
Referring to me as THE B*TCH and saying my Republican grandparents are sucking d*CK but seem to also want to benefit off of my family so I'll align with people who resolve that quickly correctly and legally. No leniency for predators doing this.
😢😢 MSNBC fake network 🛜
Trump 2028
Welp let the meltdown begin! 🎉
Hahaha,  losers
I just came to see their reaction 😊 Trump/Vance, praise God ❤🎉❤
Thank you for all, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz 💙🌊🤝 ! To me, you will always be  Madam President 🇺🇲 !
2016 - A new hope 2020 - The empire strikes back 2024 - Return of the jedi
The more she spoke the worse it got. Thank God we have someone bona fide 🇺🇲🦅
We got the good ending folks!! Lets go Trump!!
They did not want to admit that Teump got past 270. Pathetic.
The votes need to be recounted there’s no way…
Trump. And the house and senate....
All the hateing and lies yall try to put on trump pay backs a dead dog dont forget that
who else watched him standing there totally lost for almost 2 hrs. i came back every 30 mins to see if he was still there 🤣🤣🤣
Seriously stop! Trump WON! Lick your wounds and go away!
Im not good with math..but i think Trump won..mathematically....✌
We would like to see the detail , what’s the %age of the votes cast so far in each state? it was there earlier
Congrats to the people who sold their wives and daughters for cheap gas .   Elon even warned you about how intentionally bad America is about to get and you applauded... You're applauding for a bad economy?   My Goodness... Absolutely no rest for the clueless.
Ya’ll don’t get it. I’m talking to the media. You should have listened to the people and ran Harris based on their perceptions, not what you wanted. Probably don’t care about the economy or abortion because they didn’t want her. America is not ready for a woman. I kept trying to tell you. People are generally petty, especially women so her qualifications didn’t matter, unfortunately. They saw her as a threat and all the blocking and tackling the media did only hurt her and that is not her fault. Most of you media folk need to shut up. I already that. All smart people running your mouths. It’s not what you think. New York Times need to go out of business, along with some of the other big time smart people.
This can't be happening. Not again! I'm in shock 😮God help us
Thank you Steve.
I believe that this is one of the THE MOST TRANSPARENT YouTube channel I have encountered in many years , in the media Field, keep it up
Even with all your lies Trump still won
Mathmatically, this is great
I thought the Democrats were running a bad campaign, but thought maybe the have number we don't have. No, they didn't. They are just very bad at this.
Democrats are waking up to a reckoning! The woke stuff is garbage, the open border is insanity and the economy isn’t sucks! We gonna fix it back though!!! The red wave has blanketed America!!!
He haven’t won yet smh
I think someone figured out how to actually flip the votes, what’s up is down and down is up.
They might be suggesting it's bc Adam gentlesom and Harry Reid and that's not inaccurate
Maybe they're searching for new suitcases of ballots for Kamala "miraculously" overlooked so far 😂😂
It is related to limp wrist and maybe musk image I keep in my mind when I reject getting assaulted by men so I think I was sexually assaulted to make a point bc BRO BRO SOMETHING
Lets not rub it in. Also lets not whine about it. Donald Trump won. Lets start working on common  goals ! We're  ALL hurting at the grocery store. Its time to work together.
Putins counting his lucky potatoes tonight
USA now a fascist country. Little by little, it infiltrated and now it's a take over. The world is trembling.
I smell cheating on Trump side
Congratulations America!!  We gots work to do!
The meltdowns are priceless... MSNBC is so disconnected to real Americans.
They think it's acceptable bc BELLA DONNA something and they think CCSD is okay with it so why can't they? BELL PEPPERS is another story STUFFED BELL PEPPERS!
Our country is so full of misogynistic cowards that are afraid for a woman to lead
We are sorry world. We tried so hard, we really did. Please pray for us. 🙏🏻💙💔💔💔💔💔💔
Well I am so sad for Kamala, how can it be that America 🇺🇸 has voted for Trump  Hard times are coming for America.  Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
You guys are losers. You stopped the guy at "president ele..."😔
They cut him off because they knew the reactions would just be memes tomorrow
He always said he loves the poorly educated! He was right! 😜
What happens when more of the votes are counted and Kamala gets over 270?
11:30:30
Nah nah nah nah hey hey hey goodbye.....
Jars of liberal tears for sale. not worth much. Kamala you're fired!
Jesus is the King of all Kings and Trump is the President of ALL Presidents, gods chosen one.
What a horrible day for us in the US.  I’m disgusted.
😄😄😄😄😄FAKE NEWS
You elitist 😮Dems did this to yourselves.  Fake Russia hoax.  Two failed impeachments. Soviet-style Jan 6 show-trial.  Two federal prosecutions and two state prosecutions.  You opened up the border in Feb 2021.  He wins the popular vote, which he didn't win in 2016.  And the Rs now control the House and Senate.  Your self-righteousness snd disconnectedness to the rest of America are to blame.
Thanks Steve, they cut you off just as you correctly projected Trump, and just before he passed the 270
😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
🤣 harris looses after all this endorsement
Thanks to the mainstream media, who have elevated Trump's madness and resentment to the level of normality.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
From Canada, we pray for America!!!
Electoral and popular vote. The people have spoken make news unbiased again
usa is a joke
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shame on you media biased, with all your propaganda report and lies, Americans decide who to lead the country
Perhaps those cameras are running on autopilot at this hour ?  Steve May not know how to override the shut-off timer❓  He might have gone for maintenance help?😮  I’m waiting….. been here all night 🙄…. I’m no quitter
Devastating result
Here we go. Trump won. I am scared for the United States of America. We are no longer the United States of America.
Forget race. America is still not ready for a woman president.
Would any wokie like to talk?
Lord help us. This is so disappointing
RECOUNT🇺🇸Something isn’t right. No American wants a dictator
Dems - BIG  mistake!!!! Biden dropped out far too late and you had the wrong candidate. I saw this coming from the very beginning. 😡
Revelation; 18.  Babilonia has fallen!  The World will mourn for her!  Many merchants did sin with her!  And now they exclaimed in horror as she burned down!!   Read this Rev;  18 and prepare for the wrath coming up!
😂😂😂 they held it off as long as they could.
Now that they’ve lost, don’t those fences around DC seem a little more suspicious?
Revelation; 18.  Babilonia has fallen!  The World will mourn for her!  Many merchants did sin with her!  And now they exclaimed in horror as she burned down!!   Read this Rev;  18 and prepare for the wrath coming up!
Living proof that democracy in the hands off a population off 50% + idiots can be a dangerous system.
We are seeing His and Mike Johnson's "little surprise " of rigging the vote.
Thanks so much Steve Kornacki, wow 11 hours, great work.  We were watching from New Zealand.  Hope you go home soon and get some much needed rest.
today is day one Unite !
TRUMP WINS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations USA! You got what you voted for, a dictator.  Reap what you have voted.  RIP 🇺🇸
To all ppl needing a hope song listen to Dax "Gods eyes"🙏.. it's like Dem war cry now
Now, maybe you guys will see what the majority of us Americans have been seeing. The mainstream media has been brainwashing its viewers. Trump is a good decent man who wants to get rid of the corruption that is deep in the government agencies. And they have thrown everything against him with fake false flags and Lawfare to try to stop Americans from taking back our power. The government truly is corrupt like many third-world countries.
Does he know hes live ? 😂
❤🤍💙🇺🇸🇺🇸🙌🏼🙌🏼
To those of you claiming that he stopped in the middle because trump won🙄 How about maybe there’s a new development that’s why it ended abruptly?? How about that narrative haaa?? Oh wait. Because you guys are programmed one way 😂😂😂😂
Whats wrong with that guy
Msnbc is still doubling down on their lies. Sick losers!
Hope you guys get what you wished for. As for me I’ll keep my fingers crossed. President is the president, hopefully he does right by us.  😥
Kornacki doesn't select the President. the votes do, Pennsylvania should not have been called.
Old habits die hard. The itch to do some last minute rigging seems to be too strong 😂
Because trump won. He masterfully manipulated the voting process to his favor.
Sorry Knack.
Common sense prevailed.
Voting for Trump is undemocratic. Anyway, wait for the consequences
@11:30:20   What a salt mine.
Shocked. How do people vote against their own best interest?
The AP just called Wisconsin for Trump 😂😂
All Americans be ready to pay more taxes and be ready for the inflation to go up underneath crooked trump and be ready for social security to sunset underneath crooked trump and trump is not my president
Will he pardon the January 6th  "Hostages " ? Bye bye Obama Care....Hello project 2y !😱
That had me in suspense when those votes finally arrived, and then the live feed cut in the middle of him talking. Wild.
She's within 40k votes in Wisconsin. Recounts might be needed.
Why’s the stream die before you cry? Couldn’t even air trump winning? Wusssssssss
Trump won Michigan
PEANUT AND FRED ARE IN THE SKY ! PEANUT AND FRED SAW HIS VICTORY ON LAST NIGHT.
Revelation 13:3.
STOP THE STEAL! KAMALA HARRIS WON AMERICAN VOTERS AND THE MAJORITY!
He was about to declare Trump winner and they cut the feed
Oh America what have you done!!!!
Oh no 😅😅, what happened?
They stopped the stream before he could finish speaking lol
Now let’s see how Ukrainian war will end in 24 hours
wow
Someone pulled the plug too early, come on now.
It ended just as he said Trump would be president elect when WI gets called for him as there aren't enough votes left for Harris overtake his lead
It's Joevel, Trump president elected
I think cause he said "mathematically " trump would be the presi..."
Party time
What happened?
I can't believe this is happening again
Nanna nanna boo boo
HAHAHAHA CUT THE FEED AS SOON AS HE WON MAGA!!!!
Mathematically, Trump wins 270 but I have to go off air now
It's super close for Kamala in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Why did it end in the middle of you talking ?
lol. Is it over?
