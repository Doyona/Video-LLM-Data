Tvf wale bhai, sb sahi chl rha tha! But 12.47 wala song in logo ke Bich ni chalana tha yrr,Ye glt h  Ye song hum bs dhairya aur abhilash ke liye imagine kiye  Last 2 season se
26:44  song .......
baba ban ke gyan toh p*l hi sakta hai 😅😅😅 papi gudiya 😂😂😂
Line was best ki upsc karke bhaut kuch sikh gya hu
Guris expressions and dialogues delivery in the end is just fabulous i love it 😊😊❤❤ the way he deliver it soo great actor proud of u 😅❤😊
I wish his father will also consult with him like this and he never think to leave me like it in a middle 💔🙂but some stories are meant to be end anyways tvf don't end such great story 😅 i love it it helps me a lot to heal after ep 5 now I started loving myself and my career I have too many things to focus over that and I love the way dhairya choose her path i wish I'm also that much careert oriented 😢😅❤anyways great content tvf 🥹🥹😁
But to be honest i think dhairya here did a wrong initiate why to date ur ex's Friend i mean i don't think soo i mean u guys became friends because of him and she is backstabbing abhilash somehow he just wanted to focus on his career and usually boys have more responsibilities being a girl still i can understand his feelings  and also like after my bestfriend left me who is mine ex too 💔🙂 now but still I don't have even guts to talk to any of his friends because that feels me like im trying to be closure to him and also i have still feelings for him then why to talk to any of his friend it feels awkward and to be honest if we will together in future i make sure to keep distance from his friends because i dont want to be next dhariya  And come on guys dont think im wrong but its my opinion ik guri is gentleman and a genuine person but practically both failed as a friend its my opinion anyways apart from that series were awesome and we believe tvf will nevet disappoint us in future dear tvf make good series like this  and keep growing i love to watch u 🥹🥹🧿🧿 Lots of love from my side ❤❤ We love ur efforts and work 💝😽 💪 to all actors and tvf family ❤😊 Lots of love cause i came here to refresh my mind after my heartbreak 💔😭 but i appreciate ur efforts because u make me smile 😁 thank u 💓💓 dear tvf 🥹🥹
11:24 ye to dhoni bhai wali baat ho gai 😂😂
I really love Guri and Dhairya together

Itna Acha conversation har child aur parent me to kitna acha hota
IRS choose karke NCB m jaati ...aur drugs k khilaaf kaam karti wo aur bhi achha hota😊
tvf these days are more like product promotional videos. there are more creative and inteteresting ads than these tvf videos.
Are whyyyy finale episodes. Mujhe aur dekhna haiiiii 😭😭😭😭😭
talking about Aspirants S01   We are sacrificing all , yesss....!!! all including our loved ones..( who we plan to marry , love truly and decide to live together for whole life  ).....for the sake of our career...that single goal.... can anyone answer me..!!! , are we doing right with ourselves...???
1 no.
Sorry to say but this kind of shows over glorify Administrative services, that's why people selected in ips too try to get IAS ☺
Great episode... such a beautiful love story... why does it feels so real... i don't know
Wat a story 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
If would have been in the place of abhilash, I did had given guri the treatment, salman have to vivek oberoi 😆😂💯

new episode kab ayega bhai TVF walo
Thank you deepesh sumitra jagdish.
Last scene thoda jaroorat sey jyada unrealistic thaa
Sad part of this series, is How easily Women moveon... While abhilash kept using same spectacles after being IAS, dhaiyra kept thumping inside him, Whatever flaws abhilash may have but he loved her enough to let her go... Guri actually broked a bro code 💯💯
❤❤❤akhri ka episode Kamal ka ,, thank you
Why they are undermining IRS? CGL clear krne ki aukat nahi.. Aur aa gye IRS ko undermine krne.
pls continue this series
We want to see guri's more success

Thank you ❤️❤️
New episode kab aayega sir ye bhi batao
Waiting for 6th episode
Next episode banao Garib ki majburi nhi samjhte aap log😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No no no. Mohbhang is only for abhilash and dhairya. That emotion cant be recreated. This story feels imposed. Abhilash dhairya meant to be with each other. They deserved another chance.
Very bad portrayal of IRS service. IAS hi sabkuch nahi hota hai. Very very bad message. IRS is one of the most reputable services. Yeha aise dikhaya gya ho jaise selection hi ni hua hai. Didnt expect this from tvf
When the 6th episode will come we have been waiting for it
What abt next episodes
Amazing series
Season 2 bnao iska jldi
next episode kb
Kya series khatm ho gai??

When are you guys planning to release episode  6 😬😬
We want more episodes....
Iska next episode nhi aayega kya 😢
Beech beech me Guri ka Rabhish Kumar bahar ara he❤️ 9:21
Is it finished?
Its tuesday, i came here to Realise that the series is finished. 🥹
Age ka episodes ayega ya nhi?
Faltu ki love story batai gai... Just to make a series on it. She looked way better with Abhilash
Final ?
We are waiting for episode 6. Please upload fast.
Avilash guri or sk ki college k bad se unki upsc preparation journey tak ka ek story hona chahiye ........❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
One major mistake nobody seems to notice is how Abhilash didn't crack IAS during this attempt of Dhairya's- he cracked IRS, same as her, as seen in Aspirants season 2. He stays for his last attempt during which he supposedly cracks IAS which is gonna be one of the major plots in Aspirants season 3..
I hooe no good person ever gets Abhilash as a partner
What is the song at the 26:47 timestamp?
bruhh i thought ek aur ep aayega then i checked fir dekha ye ep FINAL THA 😒😭
Yeh toh therapy session ho gaya yaaaar, ❤
पिता की भूमिका निभाने वाले कलाकार को कई बार सोनी टीवी के कई धारावाहिकों मे देखा हैं कुछ फ़ीचर फिल्मों मे भी देखा है इस मे पिता की भूमिका देखने के बाद गूगल मे इमेज सर्च किया तो पता चला कि इनका नाम कुलदीप सरीन हैं बहुत ही परिपक़्व अभिनय इतनी सहजता के साथ करते हैं....   मज़ा आ गया  हीरो का कपड़े पहनने का सेंस भी बहुत कमाल हैं पिता पुत्र के रिश्तों की गरमाहट स्नेह साफ़ महसूस होता हैं ! इन कलाकारों से मिलकर इनके साथ फ़ोटो खिचवानी चाहता हूँ कुलदीप सरीन की कला और अभिनय का तो मैं मुरीद हो गया। बहुत बढ़िया seial बहुत बेहतरीन कलाकार... जय हो
I appreciate this whole series alot but still at the end it could be more detailed that last conversation between dheriya and guri will remain misery for all 😅❤ Else the series is osm
Good work tvf
Good ending ❤❤❤
Gori bhai
aspirants next part???
bhai aaj episode 6 aana tha na every Tuesday aata hai aaj wala kaha hai
Awesome
Now when is the next EP 06 coming?
This episode felt so rushed just to end the story you strayed away from realism. Literally no parents will accept any guy even if he is ias if he shows up drunk at midnight in their house but here they are being so happy it literally makes no sense.
I wonder, is it winter thriugh the year. All the time shawl and sweater in every episode😂😂
This was the last episode or still to come....????
we need part 2 :)
don't tell me this was it's last episode 😢
real goosebumps for upsc aspirants when  guri calls abhilash & the iconic bgm❤
This show is worst creation from tvf IKEA ke liye pura show bana diya
❤
Series has ended?
Arre yeh khatam ho Gaya kya?
Nyaa episode kyun nahi aya??
Next episode kab aayega ????
Bohot Jada padhe likhe logo ki love story😂😂😂❤
When next episode come?
Bhai ye last episode tha......
For me the best line..... after missing one opportunity now I start thinking other solutions rather abusing or making lame excuses....
You guys are best...... Keep continue making such series...
How easily forget their past and love another person.  But i cannot forget my ex.🥹

This was last episode?  Bas khatam??
Itni jldi khatam nhi karni thi sara mza hi kharab kar dia choti series ke chakkar me

This finale was everything! Guri and Dhairya's love story is so heartwarming and real. TVF, you've created something truly special. Thank you for this beautiful series! ❤ We're so in love with them. ✨

The scene between father and son, i mean the last talk between them, hits differently❤, a hunger and a urge to talk with my father like this, can't imagined of that and obviously no gout within me.
Wow mind blowing performance by Kuldeep Sir, you are Superb & talented actor. You deserve all the praise, what acting, father & son chemistry,wow  your voice is phenomenal.
Wo log Delhi kyu shift hue?
When Abhilash will watch this episode 🥺🥺
yha londo ko constable ki job  mil jaye to turant celebrate krte or dosto k sath daru party krne nikl jate.. or madam g ko IRS chota lg rha h ..... bade log h bhai ye🤣🤣
wtf i was waiting for next episode from past 6 days
Agla episode kab aaega ?
No matter what but dosti ki bandi ex kyu naa hon galat hai toh galat hai 😏😬
21:25 series Peaked here❤
Bhai karnal mei to nahi bni ye...karnal ki kahani to nahi hai...or vo bhi aaj 10-12 saal pehele ki to bilkul nahi😂😂..iski maa chod dete..agar ye daaru peekr apne ghr bhi chla jaata to...ladki k ghar jaakr ILU bolna to door ki nahi...out of the universe door ki baat thi😂😂
What if isi series me abhilash nd  north east india wali ips dono ko husband wife declare krke kuch mint ka scene de de😊...best for next season of aspirants

What writing!! I wait for a day when TVF makes a movie for the big screen. Show kaise banate hain, wo toh sikha diya, film kaise banate hain wo bhi sikha do India ko. Love TVF!

End of the beginning 🎉
Thank you for this episode
One of the best stories ……❤
oh bhai ye to btao ki usne IRS liya ya nhi... galat baat
Back then in ORN, Guri had been with a girl of the same calibre and Beauty but here he is written as confused as a man falling in love for the first time. Character development is buried deep under the cash piles thrown by IKEA on TVF.
The best part of the conversation between father and son relate that wording I'm also the father my done his 10th now he is growing up I can understand how difficult to understand the son felling and think about getting changes on it tvf also give some think different and unique
Bhai next episode jaldi laao

@theviralfever yaha pr end Krna jaruri tha? Anyways glt kiya yha end kr k....... Make more upsc series like this.

The series is full of life lesson ...Starting from the aspirants shows the student life the obstacle, challenges, friendship, love and many more the factor that student or aspirant had to face in life full of roller-coaster ride and then this comes Guri's and Dhairya's love story Dhairya's character shows the moving on in life and Guri's character being loved by someone they way he is the combination is superb, how they handled and stood together for each other different thoughts, different approach, two different soul  but one thing that binds them together is there love and being together awesome work by TVF and yes the bond of son and father the conversation was wholesome. Thank you TVF! :)
hope someday, i will also find my dhairya.😊😉

I like You 💕 "Sorry"- I love You ❤️‍🩹
Love from assam
❤❤❤
Very nice outstanding episode
The perfect ending........
TVF dil jit raho ho aise series se ♥️♥️♥️
In the previous episode it was shown that Abilash is already an IAS when Guri asked to go back to him, but wait results came now!!
I was expecting at least 20 episodes
I guess Uncle aunty had a child who might have failed in UPSC and committed suicide, that’s they Uncle goes to the center and sell Rajma Chawal to students at nominal prices
Till date since 2012 i believe TVF does better storytelling and narration touching heart and positively soothing music.
I don't want it to end 😔😔
Realism koi @TVF se seekhe, Kya timing h episode ki, aj hi UPSC result aya !
Thankyou for 101 subscribers
Amazing plot.....fabulous direction and wonderful cast...you keep the emotions high....RULA DIYA.❤❤❤
Best series forever from aspirants ❤❤❤
The best video on the internet so far ❤
❤❤❤❤
really bas aise hi cahata hoon mere aur mere papa ki baate hoon bina kisi baap bete ke bullshit se tag ke vo jo chahe mujhe batana mujhe bata paye main jo chahu unhe bata pau but esi feelings mostly mind  mein hi reh jati hain  kabi nikal nahi pati
What ever uncle told guri is biggest life lesson ever given by someone on the internet 🫡🫡
behenchood Finalee !

Now it is confirmed that the UPSC interview scene shown in last episode was the same shown in the Aspirants Season 2 where Abhilash and Dhairya saw each other while sitting in the waiting room. But one question still remains, if Pragati saw Dhairya why didn't see notice Abhilash!😂
aek hi to dil hain aakhir kitni baar jeetoge yr TVF😍😍
Aap log 100 siries or bhi bna lo, abhilaash or dhairya ki kahaani se better guri ko nahi laa paoge.guri ka apne hi dost ki ex ke Saath jana, laakh mature hoke bhi dhairya ka abhilaash ko naa samajh paana. Tripod ke naam par, understanding ke naam par abhilaash se uski puri duniya uskaa pyaar chin lenaaa....  Aap kabhi justify nahi kar paoge.  Jab abhilaash ne shadi ke phle vo chashmein ka box dala thaaa... vo bndaaa bss jataa nahi paaya, par uska dost or uskaa pyar dono Mein se ek bhi wafadaar nikl pata, intezaar kar paata. Toh shyd kbhi dhairya abhilaash ki hoti.❤  This is my opinion
Sandeep bhaiya set  Sk ki life set  Abhilash ki life set  Guri or dhairya ki life set   What next ??
Jldi jldi Laya kro ye episode
What a great ending!! What a great music!! What a great character!! What a great bgm!!!❤❤ just love it
Thank you TVF for the masterpiece ❤❤❤

Jo ye father or son ke bich conversation h na har koi nhi kar pata sirf ek dream bn kr rh jata h…ese bat krna apne future ke liye unse gyan lena…hum sabke adarsh hmare maa baap hote h pr hm unse kbhi bol hi nhi pate or na hi us trh se bat kr pate h kyonki ab hum Bde ho gye 🙁
Ab Aspirants ko mazeed drag na karna plz @tvf
Upsc result and this episode🥹
Loved it ❤
Itni jaldi khatm ho gaye sare episode…pata hi nahi chala
This is called simply awesome
Yr Tvf tum ek na daily basis pr koi bhi new story ka ka episode upload kr diya kro kyonki pura week wait mushkil hota jaa rha h ab tumhari adat si jo pad gyi h
@TheViralFever Loved the series! As much as I loved Aspirants! ❤️ However, I'm really disappointed with Dhairya's decision not to join the IRS. Throughout the show, we saw her passion for making a difference for addicts and changing systems. While an IAS officer might have a direct impact, I believe an IRS officer could contribute meaningfully too—through policies regulating harmful substances, advocating for rehab funding, or raising community awareness. In previous episode, the interview question about running an NGO vs. joining IAS felt like a cliffhanger, and it could have made sense. It felt like a missed opportunity for Dhairya to serve the nation in her own way. 💔
We want more episodes like this .. awesome guy's
Father is a note only a word. this is emotion and all solutions ❤❤
❤❤❤ What a series!!!
Father son conversation touched my heart ❤
Kya likhte ho yaar aap log... Inta smooth... Barfi ki tarah bighal jati hain story....
❤❤❤ Jabardast what a content
Is this the last episode 😢?
Wanted season 2
Allah see this video 📸

Itna ghatiya climax chi
TVF You're the best ❤.....every story relates with common indian 😍
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.

यहां डी ग्रुप नहीं मिल रहा, मैडम IRS
Aspirants, a series so Goated that we already got two seasons and 3 spin offs. Kudos to TVF.

Aise kon bolta hai bhai ....

भाषण देने वाले से मैं इतना कहूंगा की हिंदी में भाषण दिया करो इंग्लिश समझने में बहुत दिक्कत होती है😂😂
The most important scene was the father son talk ❤ Everyone should have it in life when needed ❤
Bahut badhiya

Sri ram ias coching main tha, mains de raha tha,  par sir ne kaha tha this not the end nahi hua to zindagi khatam nahi haai. Upsc  was a great learning experience, turning point of my life.  Aaj main jo kar raha hun jo himmat hai vo shyad  har kisi ke baat nahi,. Main select nahi hua but studied i hard, but what I am doing is tougher then that only because I had my five year plan in orn
What an episode....... Guri is so cutee ❤❤❤
TVF..... ❤❤
Finale ! Kya majak h Kal shuru Aaj khatam. Kuch bhi acha chiz lambe samay tak kyu nahi chalta ?
Each episode speaks volume. the simplicity and tenderness in the characters are just phenomenal. they say there's nothing perfect but this story rightly narrated " insan puzzle ki pieces k tarah hote hai, Kush kismat woh hai jinhe unko Pura karne wala koi miljai". thanks a ton TVF , you guys are just amazing.❤❤

Waiting for next episode please release soon
Best best best best best best best.hum khush hogaya bhai🤍🤍thank you tvf🤍🤍🤍
This is just a web series and fictional but it is disrespectful to the whole Civil Services Exam to not choose because she got revenue services. It is hypocrisy because it is known you can get any service any cadre when you apply so wasting someone else's seat because you don't respect it is desrspectful to the whole Civil Services.
Baap khel gaye last main,impact dal diya episode bapu ne
Reality mei jayega na bc toh ladki aur uske maa baap bolenge IRS mei selection hua isliye aa raha hai 🤣🤣
Wait what, it's finale?😭

What an episode 🫰🫰🔥🔥
Aspirant ka season 3 kab laa rahe ho ♥️
If tvf doesn't release the next episode asap I will fille an F I R
Dear TVF Team,  Back in college, while others were preparing for CAT, I was binge-watching TVF Pitchers, preparing for life. My dream wasn’t IIM—it was "TVF HQ, Any Role, Just Let Me In." 😄  I told myself: “Bhai, ek din toh apun bhi intern banega TVF mein.” But life had other plans...  From telecaller to now Director, I climbed the corporate ladder one painfully awkward client call at a time. Today, I earn more than ₹30 LPA, lead teams, close deals, and wear blazers without sweating—yet here I am, mid-episode, typing this with full emotion and zero punctuation.  Because deep down, that fanboy who just wanted to be around storytellers never left. And if it means starting from scratch, fetching coffee, holding boom mics, or being the 47th chai in a script—I’m ready to reset, re-learn, and relive.  Give me a chair in the corner, a laptop with broken keys, and a whiteboard. I’ll bring the ideas and jugaad.  TVF was my dream job before I knew what a job was. And now, after living the "corporate dream," I’m ready to chase the real one.  Yours truly, The guy who made it to the top—just to ask if you still need someone at the bottom. 😄 – Jash Parmar
Next session
Thank you tvf team for bringing such a amazing series ❤
Yar ek bar me pura episode release kar 😢😢
Hali anti ankal

ORN mein toh SK bhi rehta hoga na. Woh kaise nahi aaya
This Episode is like a RollerCoster. Man its crazy. Wooooooo...!!!!
Next part kab aayega ?? Or episodes laao yaar 😢
Dil ko chuu gaya ye 21 min se leke last tak wala scene..
Irs mil jaye to koi nhi chorta ....
What a beautiful rendition - emotions and kalaakari ka guldasta banaadiya … waah dil jeetliya
Ok amidst all the appreciation which btw this one totally deserves, why does the end feel rushed up and abrupt. There was a lot of room to wiggle and explore tbh. I agree it's sweet and everything, but it just ends without any followup or explanation and us accepting them fast forwarding to getting married.   Rest assured, another really amazing one from TVF❤️✨
Vote for deepa and abhilash love story ❤
ek saath do seen chal raha hai waa #Guri❤
Bhai yr itna wait Krna padta h usme baad na jane kese episode itni jaldi khatam ho jaya h 🥹🥹
This episode was the bestttt
Best episode ❤
Simply superb
This one is the best episode
❤
19:56 you should not use thermocol plates, instead use IKEA FSC certified plates
Good one
Hope more webseries like this we definitely expecting from tvf... pls do such type of webseries,  while watching,  we feel we are living with this webseries 🙌
Music 🎶
excellent
Sare ke sare dialog jabardast h  1 no.
Sharab pike propose kia toh acha nhi lga
1:23 ..this monents is not thhiss much feekkkaaa...  Its filled with shivers and sweat.. With fingers crossed... Eyes blurred... This people have shown this as a very casual moment...
TVF you guys are fabulous 👌👌Top notch work❤
Gajab
yar episodes jaldi release karo
Love this series... actually love the entire Aspirants series (parts also)...truly motivating...but  Itna jaldi kyu khatam ho gayi...❤😊
Loved it!🌻
Bhai ... Propose krne ka style bhut zabardast tha❤
Most loved episode of the series ever😮❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Fun fact aj really m upsc 2024 ka result aaya h
Dosti se pyar ka safar  baap se bete ka safar  ❤❤❤❤❤
Thank You, God. For really giving the best parents. My dad to support & guiding me all my life ❤
16:52 😂😂
Sach me bahut mehnat lgi hogi is masterpiece ko banane me
😔
Are bhai ese chalne de na finale mat kar eska
abhilash ko dekh kar mai khush ho gaya , achha laga
You just made me happy and gave me a motivation to think more in life
Ohhho aaj finale tha😂
Aesa kaha hota hai ki ladke ka pita usko berozgaari me shaadi ki nasihat de? Aesa kaha hota hai ki Upsc ka result nikal jaaye aur parents ko koi khabar hi nahi ho especially when they are educated. Aesa kaha hota hai ki ladka ladki k ghar sharab pee kar raat k 2-3 baje aakar ladki ko propose kare aur maa baap accept kar le? Why are showing things that doesnt happen in reality 😢
❤❤❤❤
What a bakwaas ending!!  Like starting on a good note and ending the show abruptly (just for the sake of ending it)..  Seriously very disappointing from TVF's side.. atleast not expected from them ....
12:24  Guri: Tujhe sarcasm ka award milna chahiye  Dhairya: Woh main tumhe hi dedicate karungi  Guri: Tu mujhe yaad rakhegi tab naa Dhairya: Problem toh tumhe bhulne ki hogi Guri  What a scene ❤️❤️
mazaaaaa aaagyaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ab dhairya aur guri ki suhagraat.... webseries banao
जुगल भैया ने सही कहा था - स्त्री अमरबेल की तरह है, जो हमेशा पास वाले पेड़ से लिपटती है।।। #Bitter truth
Are bhai yhi p khtm kr diye yr....aage badhao kahani
Another masterpiece from tvf again watching the last proposal vala part❤️
Kya bna diya yar …direct to heart ❤😅
Result bhi aaya hai aaj upsc ka
Daru pee ke khushi mili sabko
Yr essa mt kro...or episode bnaao ...abhi to mzza aana shuru hua tha ....Bhai Kya to bnaate ho tum TVF wale....ek dm nashaaaa ....😍
Please Tvf we need more episodes

Rent house par bhi house warming hoti hai ?

Itni jaldi finala kiu
❤❤❤❤
Kya series banate ho yaar.... each and every episode is precious and teach sometime...touch our hearts.... waiting for more... and yes guys u all deserve a round of huge  applause 👏
Life Update - Dusro ki khushi me khush ho jata hu 🙃
Keep motivating us tvf. Nice content...bnate raho❤❤
Beautiful episode
❤
Definitely made me cry. 😢 touched my heart! ❤️
Ab agla season bnega, Guri dhariya ka bacha kaise hua? 😂😂
Real life me guri jaise ladko pe hi cheat karti hai ladkiya 😂  Pyaar utna hi karo jitna inn ladkiyo ko hazam hota hai
Ok good but not on top notch dialogue were owsome final you could add 10 minutes
This episode filled with overacting
❤
Baaki sab first class hai lekin sab log IRS ko aise q treat krre hon jaise dhairya koi failure hai, it's IRS after all
Guri se pyar ho gyaaaa♥️♥️
TVF never disappoints ❤ What a series!!!
Awesome ❤❤❤
22:15 Guri ne apne baap ko aise dekha jaise dhoni ne shastri ko dekha tha
Best episode ❤
I'll cry
NEXT EPISODE?
In episode 5th, song is used...that is good...5th epidode kuch achha lga.. Add some hearttouching music....Views will be increased.....  I don't know...But Guri - Dhairya ki love story itna feel nhi de paayi... Add something.....To make hearttouching....
Pata nahi yaar , I like SK , Guri & Dhairya, Sandeep bhaiya  Since aspirants days ,    Ye abhilash ka abhi tak decide nahi kar paya hoon TVF waloon❤
❤❤
Super like for this episode....this is not a binge drama but learning for life
Ashish's conversation with his father Sandeep Bhaiya's conversation with his father Now Guri's conversation with his father Aspirants has a different connections with our fathers
I have fallen in love with tvf❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Guri aur uska bap aur dhairya sb besharam log hain  Ex friend ki girlfriend k sath kon jata h bhai?
Tu mushkura rha hai I know
Bhaiii maja ayega last seen dekhar
Aaj upsc final result aaya...   mujhe pre 2025 k liye bahut anxiety ho ra
After Proposal Dhairya reaction❤❤❤❤❤
Sbse pyara guri
Guri or other people are doing good acting than any other Bollywood nepokid😅.
Best one ever ❤
22:54 we need this type of father in our society
I badly don't want this series to end it's toooo good
That whistle in the end !!
Areee yaar khatam kyo kr diye ho be m sala hawa me chl rha tha dekhte dekhte isko end krke jamin me ghusa diya
The conversation between father and son is good. But somehow I feel they just abruptly ended. It could have done in a better way.
Ye thand kyu nhi ja rahi tvf ki
that father son scene should be more..
Iska Season 2 bhi ayega kya??
Yaha IRS mlne p bhi dukhi h log
Best episode❤❤❤
20:45 - 22:20
Mind-blowing Episode ❤❤ So many things to learn from this episode. Specially Positive Approach in every situation 😍😊 & That Father -Son Conversation & Climax scene with Dhairya ❤❤❤
the son and father's conversation.... i need 😅❤
Next episode kb?
Bhai ❤Sahab Kya episode tha …. Or sab se jyada baap or bete ka aapas mein baaton ko discuss karna
Best line 21:16 aap dusra btao ji.....😂😂😂😂
Aaj hi dhairya ka result aaya hai. Or aaj hi UPSC 2024 ka final result. What a coincidence.😂😂
Propose scene made me emotional..😢
Amazing ❤
Ek aur episode to ho hi sakta tha yar
Why TVF series episodes limited to just 5!? Aspirants, Cubicles, Kota Factory, Gullak all just 5 episodes
90% of the love issues will be solved if girls start treating ex as ex like Dhairya did. In reality, they just can't get over their Ex
Season 2 ????
Please yaar  Sare episode dedo please ❤❤
Mohbhang is emotion ❤
Thanku for making such a beautiful episodes, u all are doing ur jobs much better than bollywood keep it up ❤️❤️👌👌💪
What an episode 🔥❤
❤❤❤
Itna badiya storyline, dialogues,acting..dil jeet liya. ❤
Har baar rula dete ho yar @tvf ❤
The conversation ❤
Yaar woh baap bete ki aur guri aur dherya ki talk dil ke aar paar ho gayi ❤
Upsc result vi aj aya
itni haldi kyo khatam ho gaya
Most Awaited next part .. thanks tvf excellent  story
We need more web series like this..
Next episode
This series highlights a pivotal perspective of life. People who mess up their personal life thinking that would boost their professional life..., actually end up loosing both. 😢😢😢  Hope my husband understands this some day.
One of the best love story from TVF loved it ❤😊❤😊 And want to see this type of content in the upcoming days. Pure nostalgic❤❤❤❤
Ab next spin off Abhilash aur Deepa ki love story hai kya?
No way they chose that moment to end the series! 😭
This is best ever
Uff Mohbhang wala gana... 2021 me le gya 😅
Loved the writing of this series - so good, true and transparent. Kudos, I feel like this time writing is outshinig the actors.
Bhai ek series ab inki shadi or uski tyariya wale scene ka nikal do 😅😅
Love it ❤
Beautiful of all the episodes so far♥️
Ab samajh aaya dhairya ne guri ko kyu choose Kiya
Bahut Badhiya ❤ Guri- Dhairya ❤
हग दिये लास्ट में ।
Love the part of the Positive approach "For finding the solution"
16:41 life lesson ❤  Guri ❤
Nhi krna tha IRS to preference me kyu bhara ????
Excellent, very impressive.
Mai chahta hu ki Guri aur Sandeep bhaiya ke papa ek dusre ko dekhe
I have been waiting for a long time for this episode so Thanku viral Fever for such a great or relatable episode ❤😊
Sir next parts ❤❤❤
Ek hi dil kitni baar jeetoge ❤❤
What a story—really love it! 🤍
Lsat epi tha kya??
Waiting for next season

Dream proposal of every boy ❣️
This is last episode ?
The Last Smile of Dhairya clearly shows her Love towards Guri. Great work TVF ❤❤
Good thing about this episode - this cringe unnecessary series ended! Stop this spin off!
I like Gudiya ,mujhe bahut aachi lgti h 😊💞
Shhh.. The Silence , The Conversation and the Love  Thats what makes relationship strong stronger and finally the strongest one. Gradual process of Strong Bonding between Father and Son, Best Friends to Beautiful Couple is well shown in this Series.❤❤Lots of Love
🎉❤❤❤
What a perfect timing of uploading the episode 🎉🎉  Aaj UPSC ka result laga, aur udhar abhilash ban gaya IAS
15:52  yaha mere papa bol rhe hai khud kma khud business kar 😢😅 but I'm happy no problem 😊

Climax was just awee moment❤
I cried the first time I heard "Mohbhang" years ago. I cried again today when this beautiful song started playing. TVF.... WELL DONE!!!❤️❤️❤️
Itni bhagam bhag wali series me kam se kam kuch to romantic banai
End mein main kyu khush ho rha hu😅😂
Yr ye love story yuhi chalti rehni chahiye....best love story❤
Most ignored character in this series is sk 😢
Best episode ❤❤❤😊😊😊
Bhai Dhairya ke pitaaji kitne Chill haiii hahahha Beti ko koi itni raat m daaru peeke I love you bol rha hai "and He's just okay with it  this is funny
The extended version of 'BAIRAGI' 🤍✨ Totally Unexpected ✨
Best episode
Kiya yr baap or beta sharab pee rhe h 😮 20:40??? 😢
Funny was" kese" 😂
Guri - I LOVE YOU धैर्य  Abhilash - डंडा लाओ जल्दी, साला धोखेबाज निकला 😂😂
Papa ji jo gyan dete hai bhaishab
What a coincidence UPSC ka result bhi aaj aaya aur series me bhi..and the best part of today's episode was Mohbhang and abhilash❤❤❤❤..thanks TVF for all these memories
Is series ne relationship and career growth ko lekar ek mature outlook diya h...❤
Yesterday i have noticed dhairya in mein tera hero😅😅
Superb... Aur pls bring  all TVF old vedioes TVF qtiyapas
Finally wait is over ❤ final ep out 😊if u can give me heart ❤ proposal was too good but predictable also bcoz 2nd scane 😂 don't relate both
Hum Insaan bhi puzzle ke aadhe adhure tukde hote hai. Kismat waale hote hai wo log jinhe wo insaan milta hai, jinhe wo pura karta hai. Bht khoobsurat baat hai ye ❤

Bhai Guri aur uski Baba ki conversation 🥹 Yaad aa gaya bahut kuch♥️
Guri bhai jesi himmat kar ni padegi lagta hai. Pyaar ka izhar karne ke liyeee🎉
Mohbhang ❤ TVF please ek aur episode
Dhairya is green flag💚💚💚💚
Ye director bada hi unromantic hai ,ankho me ansu aa raha tha isne break hi laga diya
6:09:- IAS Abhilash ✨

Love you TVF..... This creation is really amazing.... 🤩🤩🤩
Season 2 ayega kya
Abhi na jao chhod kar k dil abhi bhara nahin❤
The Words of wisdom from Guri's father were equally important for girls to listen and understand!  It was a magical scene.  I replayed it as many times as I could to internalise everything that he said. 👏👏👏
This episode gives you dopamine spike ...good dopamine 😊
Best episode. Finding solutions is better than living problems.
While watching this episode, I first got goosebumps after the Mohbhang song. I thought that was it, but at the end, you did the same thing again. Why TVF, why? You have such a genius team! ❤️❤️❤️
TVF- I LIKE YOU ❌         I LOVE YOU ✔️✅❤❤❤
"Tera kaisa sa moho bhang piya" this song something else🥹❤️ from aspirants to this this has a special place in my ❤️💜
As always great episode by The TVF Excited next series like:- Sandeep bhai S02 or Aspirants S03🤞🤞

I don't know why each Ted Talks of Aspirants feel like it's made for me.  I really needed to listen this one too..❤   Thanks TVF for guiding us by your series.
12:28  Girls should know that, guys never go for hints... Always be straight to the point!  (Kal ko hint k chakkar me popat ho jaaye to! Bilkul riks nhi lene ka)
Is this final one? Hoping more such series, can we audience be surprised?
Wowwwww wooowww What a ending love itt❤

Kota factory season 3 kab aayega 🙄🙄
Koi hain kya jiska list main naam aaya UPSC 2024 main ❤
I eagerly wanted to see a conversation between Abhilash and Dhariya 😊but I disappointed 😔😔
Every father deserves a son like Guri. And for every Guri there’s always a Papaji
आज result भी आया upsc का मेरा फ़िर से नहीं हुआ  Qki मैंने दिया ही नहीं था!!!
Masterpiece!

TVF chose the finale episode on the same day UPSC declared its result.. 😅😅
I was going through a tough time coz of recent breakup and was really getting depressed due to not being able to find my right partner for marriage. But this episode's positive attitude dialogues really helped me get better perspective. I'm feeling a little bit better now. Only hope right now is to find my perfect life partner. Hope that happens soon <3

Oh come on, how can you guys end it here!? 😭😂 Definately want more seasons of this! ❤
it was around 1st lockdown. as same as now, i was waiting for release of each episode while everything around was shutdown the song "mohbhang" was embedded so deeply that i used to hear it from episode. dhairya left chai on table.. her tears rolled down the eyes......and abhilash walking up stairs. yes, it is nostalgic.😊
What was that ending TVF ?❤🥲🥹🥺 Guri character is the all time bestest of all TVF series  What an acting 💥 Bhaiya Man Gaye  Isse Behtar koi nai Bana pata Ab Jo Future me isse a66i series aayi to Vo TVF ki hi hogiii  What an extra ordinary 🙌  Game of thrones, breaking bad it was all alone equals to This Series 🤐🤐❤❤  Amazing TVF
Gazab matlab gazab har ek ek scene n dialogue n that is too deep 😍😍
Thank you tvf itna pure and nostalgic content dikhane ke liye i enjoyed ❤

I am following TVF for more than 10 years, and I have introduced this channel to so many of my friends in 2015 around, and believe me it has never disappointed ever since, music, lyrics, story, screenplay, direction, humour what not, simply amazing work, keep up the good work @TheViralFever
It is not all about love story😢
Khatam ku kar dete ho
It is necessary to drink while talking with your father's , I am requesting to stop involving liquor during this type of scenario. Thank you
How could you make such a masterpiece.. please give some script to bollywood
Best of the Best

This episode felt empty. Not much happened .
This song “mohbhang” ❤
Bas itna hi 5 episode mein khatam 😢 or hota tho maja hi aa jata❤
❤
Team TVF has the potential of making series like "F.R.I.E.N.D.S" that will be popular for at least a decade .
https://youtube.com/@tiwarisir-official?si=Lpfh9MZh1TrgHfm7
Are guri bhaiyaa last mein to apne chhakka mar diya😅
28 minutes fell like 5minutes
Aaj hi UPSC ka bhi result aya hai
When will be the Next episode release date?
What a coincidence.. even CSE 2024 results are out today, haha 😅
Amazing 🎉🫰🫰
Please make more episode.... Aadat ho gyi h... Is love story ko dekhne ki
masterpiece   conversation between father and son  and the way he is proposed to her👐   nostalgia songs ❣️
Kitne sulje hue insaan h guri k papa ji. Kaas aise papaji sbko mile
But jo bhiii huaaaa achaaaa series sab ka sab😊
Love from bihar (bhagalpur )❤
❤❤
TVF never disappoints as best story telling and background music sidha dil par 1000 time better than bollywood
Amazing just amazing 😊
❤❤❤❤
Final episode???
perfect.❤‍🩹❤
Bhai ye gaana seprate upload karo @tvf team
Ye sb kuch India me hi possible hai kuch bhi ho entertaining ho jata hai😅😅😅
Tvf kahi kho gaya hai... Kahani achhi hai... Star cast to hamesha se avon raha hai, lekin kahaniya wahi atak gayi jaha se tvf ne kabhi shuru kiya tha. 2021-22 me tvf ki kahaniya aur kirdar dono hi hamesha kuch hat k hote the.  Ho sakta hai ye meri personal thinking ho lekin tvf ko ek bar fir se sochna chahiye... Aur fir se chote shahro se kuch naya aur hat k lana hi padega
Ye episode dekhke last me ek smile aa gayi chehre pe 😊
Maja aa gya yaar❤❤
Itna Chhota episode 🥴😭🥴
Paapi gudiya ke upr bhi ek series bnaao ki vo paapi gudiya kese bani 😂😂
Absolutely emotional ❤
Everything went well but we saw Avilas who came to the house of Khuri and the dhariya but we did not see any such scene here.
Coincidence: UPSC CSE 2024 result and 5th episode ek saath ek time par release huye 😂
Guri guri guri guri guri❤
❤❤❤
23:23 main bhi darr gayi. Mere muh se bhi cheekh nikal gayi 😂
Have been missing these slice of life kinda series from TVF.  This was so good. Definitely want more. ❤
Tvf not a youtube channel it's emotion❤ thank u so much 🎉for these kind of content
16:32 raapat maar dia bhai TVF ne bht bda kafi sare logo ko jo khud bhi galat h or desh ko gaali bakte h
Aur episode dkhna tha😢
Ye log padhne nhi denge
Ending is not good
Awsmmmm loved ittt😘

Perfect short and sweet love story  I believe acchi kahani wahi jo sahi time pe anjam tak pahuch jaye 🎉❤ Bina kisi explicit scene  Bina kisi gaali galoch  Full  love in its true form  " Ki hai bss ankho mak dekh ke .... Ek dusre ke sath hoke ... Ek dusre ko support krrke.... Hi pyaar hota ha .... ❤❤"
UPSC ka result aa gya 😊😊
Ye movie kalpanik hai esase motivational leke apne family se aisa koe expectation mat rakh lena log bhai failure ko mazak me bhi mazak banaya jata hai respect to dur ki baat hai koe usase koe muh nahi lagata chahe wah insan ka behaviour kitna bhi achha ho , aur successful girl pasand kare ye to aur ek mazak hai 😂😂😂
We want more episodes🥺❣️
What a timing! Today UPSC official result too came
We need more stories from aspirants ❤
Conversation between son and father's, Mohbhang again and Gudiya Cute face ... it's worth it. I hope something new will be come or i hope you'll give some importance to Sk character as well.
PRAISED YOUR WORK
Wahh .. jis din result agya usi din upload kiye 😅

Aspirants series mein guri ke sar par chot thi. Par yanha nahi hain. Jab maine aspirants dekhi thi tab sochti thi ki Shivankit ke sar par chot kaisi. Phir Abhilash ki ladai dikha di. Par yanha chot gayab 😂😂
Are guri ke papa ka awaz sandeep bhaiya jaisa h😅
Couldn't be last!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😇😇😍😍😍😍
It just came out at the right time , how does TVF do it always , I have also been in the same scenario , i love this girl a lot but she had been with guys , and have also made horrible decisions with them , just what i wanted to hear and see , she loves me the most but her past and past hurts me a lot and i too keep obsessing over her partners
Or do teen episode banaoo❤....bht accha laga...
Guri ke sali meri hai
Aaj hi Dhairya ka bhi result aya, UPSC ka bhi
Next part?!

"UNIVERSITY WALA PYAR"
Guri did almost everything for everyone but got almost nothing in return. They are definitely lucky to have Guri in their life.
Abe aisa kaise final... Abhi to warm up hi chal raha tha
Agar possible ho to koi update de dijiye... Next season k liye

Esi series bnana band mat Krna bas. Jisme guri bhai ho dhariya bhabhi ho. Abhilash. Ek bhai ho 😊
Also loved the way guri sportingly accept investors denial,instead of cribing he was aiming for solution.
best ending
Kyu khtm kiya
Bhai bhut bhut gazab. 😊😊 Guri bhai 🫂
Guri trying to overcome tye past is such a pain for me 😢😢😢
I so loved this series...plz bring part2 of their story ❤

Wonderful 💝 27:20
My personal favorites tv series from TVF: panchayat, pitchers, Hostel Daze, Cubicles, Bachelors, Aspirants and Kota Factory
Daru with dad 5 gone emotional
Yeh wala tha best episode...
Thora nahi romance daal dy insan... thora romance
Wow, you guys are so brilliant, know well how to empress.... loves lot, keep making such sweet things.
" Dharya , I love You "  Isko sunne ke liye 5 episode dekhna pada 😊... Wo bhi dhyan se . thans the viral fever for these masterpiece ❤️🥹♥️
Season 2 aaega kya??
Kya baat hai... Abhi iss story ko dakh kar man nahi bhara. 2, 4 episode or aana chahiye 😅. 1 conversation too sabhi deserve karta hai un sabhi logo sa jis ko wah bahut chahta hai.
Nice ending....Naveen appearance was great
Purpose to mai bhi usko aise kr du,  lekin kya hai na uske ghar wale aur mere ghar walo, marenge bahut mujhe😂😂. Thanku TVF 😍
Bro bahut acchi cheej thi yeh series,love you tvf for making good series
Ye TVF wale bhi Guri ki tarah hai...unpredictable!
Propose karne ka karika thoda janlewa bhi ho sakta hai 😂😂😂😂
I really love this ❤❤❤❤
3 idiot ke scene ko soch kr gjb copy kiya gya h mza aa gya 😂😂....
TVF presents IKEA.
Yaar Bhogal uncle aur Guri ki chemistry zyada achchhi hain 😂😂😂
Ye galat h love story puri hui nahi h to finale kis baat ka
A story without having sk and abhilash is Just like a tree without leaves😂😂
6:14 bhai sahab IAS me itne busy ho gye 😂
Yeh last episode h ky?😢
Ye series thodi he IKEA ka advertise banaya he
Lo agaya Upsc ka result bhi agaya.
Isse hamlog ne ek chiz sikha ki. Whisky pineke baad kuch alag hi confidence aarahhey bhai 😂😂
How can TVF pull out a love story so brilliantly ❤ TVF>>>
Or episode rah gye kya
14:38🥺 15:08😫
How many of you want one more episode?
The conversation between guri and his father and the second perspective ♥️♥️♥️ touched 💘
Ye kya baat hai ekdam incomplete ending!!!! Not done tvf 😢
Good work tvf ❤️
Abhilash entry ka w8 kbse tha❤ uske bina har aspirant series adhuri h
Best proposal ever❤❤❤
Guri Dhairya Ki Love Story’ wasn’t just a story, it was a mirror to our lives❤....Every silence between Guri and his father spoke louder than words....Every character felt real, from the bubbly Dhairya to the wise house owner uncle👴.. It captured the small-town charm, the big emotions, and those unsaid bonds we often ignore in our daily lives... That father-son conversation? Pure gold....This isn’t just a web series; it’s an emotion we all needed. It deserves not just a 2nd season, but the kind of love that classics get...10/10 doesn’t even do it justice. Thank you, TVF, for another gem💎🙏
Wow ❤😍 such a nice story 💙
Hum insan bhi adhe adhure puzzle ki tarah hote h..agar koi mil jaye jo aapko pura kre to usko kisi bhi keemat pe nhi jane dena chahiye...damn deep❤
Finale ?????
Guddiya ne सुंग Kar pata lga diya ki whisky 🥃 he 😅😅😊😊😅😅😊😊
Guri garibo ka Rancho 😂
BC Mai kyu khush ho raha 😅😅
12:48 mohbhang again !!!!!!!! Hitting nostalgic sixes
Kahani ho to esa ho ...❤❤❤
Best episode
Not good ending 😢
Assistant commissioner banegi aur kya chahiye??
Ye last episode h kya 😢😢😢😢
Abhilash ye sab dekhega to kya sochega guri bhai 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Upsc Final result bhi aa gya 2024🎉🎉
इससे अच्छा तो मेरा love story था जो अधुरा ही छुट गया...... और जिंदगी आगे बढ गई..... 😊
Loved very much .... waiting for such more love story ❤
❤❤❤
Mohbhang yrr❤️❤️
Unexpected nahi tha ye ki ese achanak final episode kar doge yaar 😮😮 part 2 must come in future.. nd cover the remaining parts.. like what happen after guri 's proposal and how marriage happen etc
Irs..  hmko clerk mil Jaye to ias ke बराबर समझूँ

Dear TVF, You always make the best web series. Just a suggestion. Why don’t you try to make a film which is linked to the ASPIRANTS story.  You guys are the best. Relieves me from the day to day work stress. Thank you so much ❤
I loved loved loved this series... Har episode ek Thandi Hawa ka jhokha lga, finale k like ready nahi thi par ye bahut khubsurat mod tha chhor k Jane k liye..  Kaafi  aasu  bhi baha liye... well done to the team ❤

What an episode ❤ I am still smiling with happy tears in my eyes . A lot of thank you to TVF for bringing stories of common people like us , i related to this love story.  Thank you for taking care of next generation expectations of love. 90s born were ruined by bollywood . This will surely pave a path for young generation to have some realistic love.  🎉 Cheers 🎉  A good note ending . Loved every scene of it.  Edit 1 - please don't add drama in this series and ruin it by continuing just because it's a hit, let it end on the good note itself .
Irs ko na kahe vali tujhe kadi saja milegi 😂😂 10:59
Plz make a series on deepa and abhilash's love story also.

Jab maine ek ladki ko I love you bola to chappal padgayei. ab pata chala pehele I like you phir baad mai actually I love you bolna thha...😂😅
The influence of woke culture is becoming overwhelming, where a father’s use of a slap as a response to a foolish idea is being reframed by woke perspectives, portraying him instead as a figure akin to a grandmother.
Laude ke webseries thi  Na yeh vaali badiya thi Naa hi vo sandeep bhaiya vaali .   Aaplog sirf aspirant season3 release kro  Baaki aapke bas ki koni
इसे अच्छी तो मेरी लव स्टोरी है....
23:23 yaha toh 3 Idiots ka Rancho ka scene yaad aa gaya, where he also goes to propose Pia while drunk.
bro breaking the bro code and i enjoyed it
Kahani Bahut achi lag rahi hai ❤️❤️❤️
Areee bhai badi jaldi  nipata diya series ko kuch khali sa lag raha hai jaise ki koi puzzle ka piece missing ho gaya ho but Chalo ye bhi Theek Hai :) I hope iss problem ka solution bhi de hi doge aap kisi tarah

Bhot pyara episode 😊😊
Problem toh tumhe bhulne mein hogi Guri is a beautiful moment❤
the uncodtional bond of father and son , what a amazing series as well as finale
A great Bond between Father & Son breaks all the Achievement that they want... ❤️  And a best role played by Gudiya in his Love Story.. 💞 And Guri played a best role for his love & friendship.. Hats off...
The story is well written , and the actors performed well but still abhilash and dhairya love story is heart touching ,just because most of the viewers are students who come from aspirants and love from study time, like their own
Can we hope another season of this blockbuster series as soon as possible...???????
❤
Ye to final nhi first episode hona chahiye..
What a series boss.. with all my hearts 👌
6:20 Abhilash ❤ moment h bhai... Aspirant S3 please soon

Abhilash 👌
Ek episode abhilash or deepa ki love storie per bhi ho jaye to maja aa jaye
This is the worst web series I have ever seen from TVF.. I mean koi story hi nahi hai, wahi ghisa pita sa story
10:15 "wahi baat karni hai  jo dusron se ni kar paa rahi" ❤❤❤❤ that feels very personal approach.
Ultimate solution - Father ❤
👌👌👌👌
Respect for guri’s father ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Master piece ❤
IAS to IAS hai. Abhilash 1 min presence is enough for the aura of ias
I wish..... I wish one last conversation with my dad.... I wish.....😢😢....
Dear tvf please do continue it
Guri is luckyto have such father❤
Dhairya acts like my ex❤
Ye story dekh bahut maja aa raha hai ❤❤🎉
Aree mujhe laga 10 episodes to kamse kam ayega 😅
Sandeep bhaiya season 2 ka wait kr rha hoon tvf walo
Bring Aspirant season 3 soon.....and Sandeep bhaiya season 2...
Too average not expected this from tvf
Lgta hai IKEA walo ne bas itne episode ke liye hi sponsor kiya tha, tabhi itni jaldi nipta diye 😅
End episode me woh baat nhi h
Want More series
When will Aspirants season 3 come? I want to see controversy between Abhilash(IAS) and Sandeep Bhaiya(ALC-LABOUR DEPT.)in the next series,i want to also see Abhinash with Deepa(IPS) If possible by the tvf team  A lot of curiosity arises in my mind about the next series😅😅
Those 1 min presence of ABHILASH 😎 Power of IAS🎉
Next part kb
One more pls.... This has to continue forever ❤❤
What a coincidence, I'm watching this series and 2 hours  ago when i checked in the internet that how many episodes in this series then i got the ans is 4. But now I got the finale episode which is posted just 1 hour ago. That's crazy!! Thanks to TVF. Love from Jharkhand. ✨❤️🙌
Uffffff❤❤❤❤
Guri represented Men like us who are not used to appreciationsor any kind of care or love. Main toh kuch aur hi keh jaata uss moment pr
That song❤..but reminds me of abhilash
The result of upsc is going to be declared today, and the timing of tvf, really appreciated ❤❤❤
Abhi next season amazon prime par ayega jo main afford nabi kar paungii😂😂

TVF bhai.... itni jaldi Finale episode kyuuu... 😭😭😭 Agla episode abb kab aayega :(
Last peg bhari ho gya

i like how the editors added the past and present transition, it was missing over the past few episodes. good one on that
Bhai ye kya hai... Aap log ko series banane nahi aati kya... 5 Episode me finale kaun karta hai..
Wow
Guri Dhairya love❤ story part 2 banana chahiye humble request TVF ❤
Aysa lgta ki jbrdsti end Kiya gya episode... Pr Jysa bi hai.. heart touching ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why do @tvf always make us feel sad for a short length story and happy for such a unique story .
Next episode kb aaega?
Bkl ho kya tum log kisne hak diya tum logo ki yeh khatam karne ka 👿👿
23:29 3 idiots style❤😂
Dear UV2216 give me one more chance
6:13 This is what we are waiting for ❤❤
Stop glamourising alcohol in your shows #tvf
The effort of the tvf's team is far far better than the bollywood movies. You people know what the audience wants.
Room owner uncleji mast h yr😅
Why TVF is glamourising alcohol in all it's shows??
Guri bhaiya rancho ban gaye last me 😂
Why TVF continuously glamourising alcoholic drinks amd culture in all it's shows ???
Why TVF continuously glamourising alcoholic drinks amd culture in all it's shows ???
Ending could've been better
मजा आ गया यार ❤❤❤😊😊
Best ever episode
Very rare lucky boys get a father like Guri....
Absolute cinema. ❤ Tvf never fails to surprise. Story was as smooth as it could be. And using the same song mohbhang shows pure emotion. Dhairya's heart broken again coz she is a pure soul, she gives 100% to everyone. Guri's emotion were also truly shown. That dilemma of being with his love but also breaking the brocode can be seen clearly. But at the end the series teaches us the only important thing is to be happy❤. Life is too short to regret. Always do as your heart says 🎉. Thankyou Tvf for aspirants ❤
Super ❤
कुछ तो कमी सी रह गई इस सीरीज में
Shadi to dikhao ❤
everyone is busy in their own life ..but thanks TVF last minute pr hmare face pe smile lane ke liye
Next ABHILASH - DEEPA  IAS - IPS lOVe story❤❤❤❤❤  How between the work they just adjust to meet each other How the constables and other juniors make fun of both IAS n IPS🎉🎉😂😂
Waah guri bhai 🎉
गजब गौरी भाई इस एपिसोड में तो मजा आ गया  And thanks you dherya
12:40 This song "Mohbhang" It's Nostalgic ❤️
Sorry but yr abhilash bhi end tak dhairya se pyaar krta tha tabhi usne dhairya ka diya hua chashma sambhal ke rakha ..isly dhairya or abhilash  ek hone the 💞
Areeee goli mar dnge agr final episode hua ye to😊
Main bhi apni problems ka Solution dhoondh raha hoon…
Aaj actual result aa rha h upsc ka @TheViralFever
Wowo yar kitani phyari story hai agla episode kab aayega yar abilash ki bi story bana do yar😊😊😊😊
Vo sb to thik h.... lekin etna ameer hona hai ki IRS mile aur join n karne ka mn kre..vahh😂😂... gazab
Bht choti series lgi yr abhi toh mahol bana tha😅😊❤
judge my comment but , I am with abhilash he loves dhairya , they should be together .
This ended so abruptly and the story line for last 2 episodes was not great
Dikkat ye hai ki.. agar yahi feelings pahle Guri ko aaya rehta aur wo express karta to Dhairya usko opportunist bolti 😅😅
Why TVF is continuously  glamourising alcohol in all it's shows ??
5 episodes only why why why ??????
26:40 Iske liye puri series dekhi 🎉❤
❤
Man of the episode - Rajveer Singh

20:00 to the rest. The whole story is good, but this part ❤. This is why I love TVF. I appreciate all the actors and all involved individuals. But what I love the most is the story they tell. They are more than perfect in this field. Keep it up guys ❤
Please update all songs of this series 🙏

State psc ke exam nehi nikal raha, dhariya ne IRS chor dii😢😢😢
Ye saare ambitious aspirant k khode 😅😅.. Ek to UPSC upar se IAS hi chaiye.. ussey niche to doob marne samaan hai.. upar se sandeep bhaiyya type jiske liye State commission chhota aur mamuli tha..  Isse wrong msg hi milta hai.. ek to youths ek mamuli job k liye bhi paresan h upar se ye series sab !!

Ghuri bhai 😢😢😢😢
The conversation between a father and a son, especially given the background, the silence between them is good to see. I wish I could have ever talked to my father and he would have given me such suggestions :)
Finale abhi nhi hona tha😥

मूवी से भी बढ़कर ये, एक अनमोल खजाना, सीरीज की हर बात में है, जीवन का ठिकाना।

Cutestttttt😭🫶🏻
bhai aj result ka din he aur tumne ajhi episode launch kiya
When is Sixer webseries coming back ?
इतने कम eposhod बनाने तो थे तो फिर इनको भी नहीं बताते इस से ज्यादा लम्बी story Mera dost har ladki KO dekh kar अपने मन मैं बना लेता है
उनकी प्रेम कहानी धीरे-धीरे विकसित होती है, जैसे सुबह की पहली किरणें धीरे-धीरे अँधेरे को चीरती हैं। चाय की चुस्कियों के साथ हुई बातें, स्कूटर पर साथ घूमना, और एक-दूसरे की छोटी-छोटी ज़रूरतों का ख्याल रखना - ये पल उनकी कहानी को खास बनाते हैं। यह कहानी हमें सिखाती है कि प्यार बड़ी-बड़ी घोषणाओं या महंगे तोहफों का मोहताज नहीं होता। यह तो दो दिलों के बीच का एक शांत और गहरा एहसास है, जो मुश्किल समय में एक-दूसरे का सहारा बनता है और खुशियों को दोगुना कर देता है। गुरी और उसके साथी की प्रेम कहानी हमें याद दिलाती है कि सच्चा प्यार साधारण पलों में भी असाधारण सुंदरता रखता है और यह हमारे जीवन को एक मधुर संगीत से भर देता है। यह कहानी आपके चेहरे पर एक प्यारी सी मुस्कान और दिल में एक सुकून का एहसास छोड़ जाती है।❤ 27:23
IKEA pls ek ye character lekar aou
आप जब किसी लड़की के संपर्क में रहते हो तो स्वाभाविक है कि वो आपसे प्यार करने लगेगी ❤❤
Aree wo uncle g bhi to thee aspirants me jaha pe wo avilash rehta thaa uske upar bhi ek series mil jata to achaa hota tvf walo
We want more
❤❤❤
11:22 when I see Dhoni playing.
We want more episodes

So i love tvf 😊😊😊
Result aarha hai aaj
Ye series apne dost ki gf se shadi karne ko justify karne ke liye banaai gai hai😂
Season 2 dooooooo😔😔😔
She Said Yes = She Smiled @26:51 🥰
शुरू करने से पहले ही खत्म कर दिया
Ye to cheeting hai 😢itni chhoti series, Dil bhara hi nahi 🎉
Yah chaprasi ki naukari nhi mil rahi aur a irs chhod rhi hai😂😂😂
22.00
6:11 THE MOMENT
The best thing of this series ki dhairya IRS huyi but still chooses what she want to be happy and satisfied❤
Sahi kiye khatam kar ke aur nahi jhela ja raha tha
❤
I just love how Guri and Dhairya hold each other together. The way they communicate and handle conflicts shows that such interactions can be healthy in a relationship and help both partners grow. It's as if they're filling each other's voids and making their journey through life meaningful.  Thank you TVF for making this wonderful series! ❤
Safe to say it was a planned episode motivating those getting IRS today!
Finale?? Only 5 episodes
Ek saath dalo yar pura series...kya adha adha de rhe ho ...😢
I felt that Gauri dhairya's Love story is better than abhilash and dhairya
Not a satisfying ending, hope we get a season 2 very soon
Such a cute episode! But it ended being the last episode of the series...I will miss Guri & Dhairya. & Off course their cute love story. Guri is the most gentle Gentleman in the whole series. He is so gentle,that his every act of kindness & care gives goosebumps in awe! looking forward to seeing More of both of these lovely people❤❤❤
Why finale..nahi..I want more episodes
Yar #tvf Walo "mohbhang" song use korka mera dil jit lya... This song 💗 it.. or ya choti bahana "Medical Dreams " sa sidha mera dil me rah gaya ❤❤❤❤
We need one more episode please..
Nice guri I love you 🎉🎉🎉🎉
PAPA KE SAMNE I LOVE U BOL DIYA IS TAKLE NE ISKI ITNI HIMMT ......
Nice song❤    It's not a series   ❤❤imotion❤❤
16:25 it’s reality 😢 people with narrow mindset often blame others for their failure
Bakwas series 😅😅
12:40 nostalgia❤❤
Finally  It's a not fair
Kya screeeenplay tha?   Forgot to write?
Tvf wale bhiyaaa itna jaldi final episode kiu de diya😢 thora or chalne dete … koi baat nehi … yea khatam too ab kuch or naya dekhne ko milega…
Ye short form me ne saare feel ki mother sister together krdi hai - ORN
I hate to think that it’s over even it 2:30 AM but I have seen this already twice  Please make one more part please 🥰🥰

meh toh IRS first time sunna hai .. abhi google kar k dekhta hung😂😂😂😂

Abhilash ❤
Ye kya baat huye khtam kar diya series
Over the top bhaiya 😅❤❤❤❤❤
Not upto the mark
No no no... We want more episodes... Don't end like this😭😢🙏
This finale looks like something is unfinished. I came up with the few things which they could have added in this episode: 1. Guri and Guri's father's Hug after his father told him to go for Dhairya. 2. Atleast a hug between, Guri and Dhairya.
Just bad.
Whyyyyyyyyy noooooooo …whyyyyyy finale whyyyyyy????? We need more pleaseeeee 🙏
I like this series
❤❤
Itna sundar hoga expect hi n kia tha.... ❤

I request to tvf to learn from guri father  Kisi jiz ko adhura nahi chhodna nahi chahiye 😅
Dhairya looking so damn beautiful in LAST SCENE through balcony.  I bet she has Pink 🎉
Guri  bhaiya finally proposed  dhairya bhabhi 😊🎉
Tumlogo ko ending likhna nahi ata kya.... ye kya backchodi tha
11:23 Sixer season 2 is cooking 😅 22:41 Goosebumps❤
Conversation between Gauri and his father is goosebumps for me ❤❤baap baap hota h literally
So good❤
Words of wisdom from Guri's father highlight of this episode.. Such a rarity a father and son having a heart to heart discussion
IRS me khushi nhi mili driti ko or yha sala railway grup D tk nhi mil pa rhi 😂
Aspirants Season 3 please
The conversation between Guri and his father is a lesson for each one of us.
Chlo jldi khtm kr kyai acha kiya ab study pr focus kiya jaye 🥹
Itna abruptly end kiya gaya? Aisa lga jaise bohat saare scene kaat kar jaldi khatm kiya gya h episode
Aspirants Season 03.. when ??
Bhai aspirants ka new season kab aa raha hai anyone??
Ending could have been better.
Masterpiece as always
Dhairya bohot sellfish hai pehele abhilash ko fasaya jab vo nhi fsa to usi ke dost guri ko fasya usko jealous feel karane ke liye dhairya is not loyal to anyone 😅😅
😅
इतना वेट करने के बाद गाना डाला मोह भंग पिया । ❤ वेटिंग एंड वेटिंग फॉर धागा ये टूटे न ये धागा❤❤
❤❤ amaazzzing 👏
Bhai pura to dikhate hi nhi  It's not fair 😔
Father the guide of life ❤
Yeh series bhot ascha lga. Bhot ascha. Ise aage continue krna chaiye. New characters introduction,a cute love story, conflict between son and dad,that young girl dhairya's sister, house owner uncle aunty, uncle's business, cheap food for students, bhaiya bhabi, father's learning to his son,dhairya's dedication to that persons who addicted......... everything  Sab kuch bhot ascha lga. Also I gave 10/10 rating at IMDB
Kya baat hai chacha ji(Guri ke papaji).............kya baat kya baat kya baat
Sabse best episode hai
SEASON KHATAM ?

Happy to see that its ended here. Otherwise it's hard to wait so long for one episode. After so long watched something which felt very genuine.  Love ❤.
Wow क्या बात है लड़की नशा रोकने के लिए IRS join नहीं करना चाहती क्योंकि उसे नशामुक्ति पे काम करना है, और लौंडा नशा करके लड़की को प्रपोज कर रहा है, wow 🎉🎉
❤❤❤
New AI Hindi Web Series out now! 🎥💥 @Dramebaaz_stories			 "Hunter Wolf" 🐺 is full of love & thrill – must watch!

Ye to shuru hote hi khatam ho gya
This is not fair we want more episodes
Yeh kya baath huyi yaar😢😢 5 hi episodes mein the end kar diya. Narak mein bhi jagah nahi milegi tum logon ko😢😢
Abhilash's entry 🔥
6:11 Thankyou for bringing a small cameo scene  It was much needed ❤  Edit: Why is Dhairya so sad 😢😂
Log ro rhe hai BC isse dekh.. kr   I know guys series achi hai story achi hai  But guys be strong
3:03 this so disheartening that a big production house like TVF is showing the IRS as an inferior job. This narrative is the reason why even after candidate getting selected other than IAS tries again and again to get IAS and wastes government resources and a potential seat that might do justice to that post.
From my side this series is going to in Oscar and nominations should be done ✅
❤❤❤❤❤❤
More episodes should come next few hours   Because i can't wait ❤
Seriously, nahi maja aaya. Aisa lagaa 2 golgappe khane ke baad hi dukaan band ho gayi.. TVF bhai aise mat Kiya Kar yaar, ek ek episode ko wait karke dekha hun.. Aspirant 3 laao bhai abb toh..
Ek or episode  de do tvf
The artists and writers and the  team of TVF are so good ....love to watch them on you tube .... Hope to see their work soon in theatres in full house..pure art❤
Inki jodi acha hai ❤❤
All these episodes made me cry! I was able to relate myself with Guri! Wow, what a show!❤️🥹🙌
Please continue this series
TVF >>>>>>> Current bolloywood movies                      Thank You So much 😘😘
