what's the message in the film? Men go ahead and marry two wives. You just may be lucky.
Why not employ someone to teach these ladies how to do things around the house?

Wonderful movie I love it ❤
😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂 I laugh die
Except God's love, nothing can top a mother's love in this world. Even if sometimes it may look like enabling their children's bad behaviors, but most of the times, they do it out of love and affection that they naturally have for their children. No man in this world knows what a woman goes through bearing children from conception, via nine moths' pregnancy to rearing to adulthood until they become independents capable of caring for themselves. This what happens here this movie with David's mother. She acted the only way mothers know how to act in these kinds of situations. A mother nurtures, while a father teaches resposabilities. So please, let us give it to our mothers by respecting and honoring them while we have them around us. We should do the same for our fathers. Exodus 20:12 & Ephesians 6:2-3. God bless us all in the name of Jesus-Christ. Amen!!!

Youths live right responsible to avoid regrets later
The lesson I learnt from this movie is that you should be loyal to the person you are with and stop having affairs with other people. In this movie it turns out to be good at the end but in reality it may not so let be loyal to each other ❤

So this guy wanted to survive on his father's money. He's a grown man ....and needed that the chance to grow up!
Who spoiled this boy? And the mother has been too soft, not using her brain, just emotions...this is why men are meant to rule the house. ❤

@ndidiokoh This movie was thrilling,with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat". "The plot was complex and suspenseful , making it to predict what we happen next."
