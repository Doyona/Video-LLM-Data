mans has been through so much, I'm impressed he hasn't killed himself
Aot
This is the most darkest times to see Twilight’s past that hit hard
War is where the young and stupid are tricked by the old and bitter into killing each other - Niko Belic
I knew it germany 1940 but i cant prove it
this is not season 3, it's a spinoff, not interested
👍👍👍👍
La guerra destruyo la inocencia y la pureza del pequeño Loid, su infancia le fue arrebatada por el conflicto armado, pero Loid no se derrumbo ante la tragedia, elimino toda muestra de emociones y sentimientos para poder sobrevivir, pero las heridas internas quedaron sin cicatrizar, hasta que conocio a su familia: Su hija Anya, y su esposa Yor.
0:19 (village blows up) *Happy music commences*
You can pretty much play any Attack on Titan op with this trailer and it'll fit lol
This made cry. As Ukrainian I can say that this is too realistic. Especially the last Loid’s words.
tf is this 😂😂😂  who the hell edited this together?! XD
This episode looks similar to what gaza ppl experience 😢💔
The theme song playing on THAT scene is wild 😭
My heart goes to Gazan children.. who are living in an absolute hell at this very moment.. without parents, home, food, medical needs and the list goes on and on..
Who is the guy that put this happy aah music on a kid getting ptsd💀
ITS OUT NOWWW!
Yay, one of my favorite arcs! It's especially sad to read/watch because I live in Ukraine🫠
This is a series that violates freedom of conscience and expression, Japan please make a petition it is a scandal that such a kaio shin or majin shin do not please stop praising the society of the poor bourgoisie , society where the deficiency of common sense and logic reigns. I am in the need to stop this crime against humanity because it is not the telepaths who reign today but rather the engineers, the physicists, the developers or even the musicians.
Hell yeah 🔥🔥
I’m crying 😭
Not the happy song while a town is being destroyed 😭🥀💔
POOR LITTLE LOID 😭😭😭
i fr thought kid loid was actually holding a gun in thumbnail.....
song:😁😎🔥 background:💀🥀
Like oh my god I stopt breathing
wow.. it’s just so real
AH yes, yes, the crying a river season, I'M SOOOO READY BABYYYY, SXF IT'S BACK!!!
this kinda like the seers program
I'm gonna cry 😭
This is gonna be peak!!!
Estou muito empolgada para a 3 temporada 🥹😍
i’m gonna die
Dock the pay of whoever choose the music for this trailer because what?
0:05 aqueles sorrisos preciosos..
0:25 MY SHAYLAAAAA 😭😭😭😭
It would've nice if we could get whole season about Loid past
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaaa
This shiuld be attack on titan
I can just hear the army dreamers edits of this arc…
Sonunda geliyor wuhuu
AM SO EXCITED  YES LIFE IS WORTH LIVING NOW
Now I realised.. why he is trying so hard to stop the east and west from starting a war ... Because he knows it well how it feels 😢
Si!! Adaptaran la historia de loid (creo)
😢
This show just became anti-semitic
Crunchyroll: showing bombs being dropped on a kid Also Crunchyroll: Crunchyroll × 🇮🇱
Had to be bombs dropping on kids huh? The world ain't gonna let me forget real life stuffs. Everywhere I go, I have to witnes something like this.
El pasado y una guerra le atrebataron mucho 😢👱🏻  El futuro y la familia se lo devolvieron ❤❤❤❤❤❤👩🏻‍🦰👩🏻🐶
0:02 why i remember AOT 😢😢😢😢
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS
I was waiting for them to adapt this arc! Hit me in the feels when I read it 😭😭
Knowing Spitz are the ones who made the anime opening. I know it's gonna be so good.
I been waiting for this arc😁😁
Hmm 🤔
0:03 sahur🗣🔥
He used to be so innocent
I love it I'm excited
Is this marley
The reason why he became SPY was the reason why I still watch this show and Anya ofcourse 😂❤
“Watch on Crunchyroll”? Well, time to sail the seven seas as they say
Why did the music change to happiness💀ruined it
I want to see a spy×family x sakamoto days episode . That would be cool
War transforms all into beast.
It’s about to head into Attack on Titan territory here.
Finally bro
Season 3 - Backstories of our main characters
West Germany and East Germany Cold War
Look like Wwar2
child soldier
Oh man Loids / Twillights past will hit so hard with the war and everything.. 😮😢
Dammnnn. Really exited for this
Now we get to the sad part 😢😢😢😢
this happy intro over bombings and death is killing me rn
Crunchyroll isn't the ONLY place to find this series.  FOR LEGAL AND SAFETY REASONS THIS IS A JOKE, PLEASE DON'T SEND YOUR SNIPER AFTER ME, CRUNCHYROLL!
So... Will the story actually progress, or is this just one episode getting deeper into it and then we are back at irrelevant filler ish things again?
I love how intense Loid subplots are. Even Yor mostly gets comdey is hers but Loid when he is alone literally changes the genre of the show.
For a few seconds it felt like i was watching attack on titan trailer.
This is sad
I honestly thought it was Attack on Titan Season 4 in the begining
This show boring af
This is like what happens in Palestine😢😢
Hella emotional watching kids who grew up in war, especially since you can relate it with real world. Civil wars in African countries, the Gaza genocide, Invasion of Ukraine.
Guys am new to anime , is this a good anime to watch
😢🥀
Loid Backstory is so cute
this was such a rough read, i am not ready to see it in the anime... 🥲
Oh my god I can’t
This'll be an emotional arc. 🎉
Soldier boyyyyy, oh my little soldier boyyyyy </3
Ah here we go again. Gotta prepare my eyes for the onions
Can't wait for Martha backstory!
Can't wait for the anime
His past is now the childhood of an average  child in ukraine sadly.
I always wondered how loid can be so amazing but behind that man is a boy who had to lose everything ueueue😭
I will cry in this season😢
The quite happy OP song playing while it shows the traumatic past of Twilight is quite strange 😅  Can't wait for next week !
Here it is...
Lloyd's Eren Arc I guess...😅😢
0:14 this reminds me of a country
Another ooting with the Forgers, this time with some premium Loid backstory. This show is an absolute delight.
When the 90s band rise up...
Finally loid backstory is here
Baby…….. *inhales* LOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
for such a adorable slice of life anime, it really gets dark really soon with cold war stuffs, people being forced to take on shady jobs against their wills, human experiments and the losing parents for little kids.
Awesome SPY x FAMILY Season 3 Loid's Past Trailer.
I am actually so exciteddddddddddddd
Would you admitting her love for loid to Anya be in season 3?
There's gonna be a bus hijacking and maybe a prom (vol14, maybe it's in this season) in which anya confesses her ability to read minds to damian. We are also gonna sea damian's brother and new neighbours that will act as anya's grandparents. Anya will earn 2more Stellas and tornito bolts.
I’m not ready dude 😭
💙💙💙
Muse india
Sometimes the best person has a bad past.
❤
it doesn't need to be said. s3 will continue to be very incredible!
Falco Grice is that you?
Kid Loid is going make us cry isn't he.
0:12 this happening in Palestine 😢
This is what all conservatives want.
Nahhhh the happy-go-lucky song does not work
This is gonna be so sad 😞
GOD this is gonna make me cry seeing it animated
You aren't ready for Martha and Mr Henderson's backstory
0:12 Flashbacks to aot: "No, no ,no, no,   wait, wait, wait wait"
WHEN WILL IT APPEARRRRRRR
Gonna be that much better than One Punch Man S3, isn't it?
Spy X ww2
LOID PAST WILL BREAK ME AGAIN 😭
Can’t wait to see his past
Ese anime se volvió aburrido
The first seconds and war are what aot season 4 would have looked like
These season will be an divisor for all of us! An emotional game that mostly of us will cry 😢❤❤
That will be 1 true painfully origin story of Loid. Well i still don't know his true name
This is going to be a great season
Ok so I am excited since I finally started watching again but bro no I will cry my eyes out seeing this animated
Happy sounding music while this kid is having trauma 😂
I'm not prepared
Oh great more filler episodes
Gives off aot season 4 episode one vibes for some reason lol
😭😭😭😭😭loid san😭😭
Was that song good?
The music didt fit the moment it caught me of gaurd
Its been quite a long time I heard SPITZ ever since Honey and Clover.
Does the show ever get “serious”?
They better not ruin this. It’s such an impact arc please I hope they don’t rush it
Ooof
The hell happened to crunchyroll ?? spy x family, mha and lots of other anime episode still not released yet
The same boy who said “Grownups are liars” grew up to become a man who lies for a living.
Shed a tear again
Il y'a que l'épisode 1 pour l'instant
I’m looking on Crunchyroll. I can’t find a third season.
Waiting ❤❤❤❤❤
After watching this arc, that scene from episode 1 of Loid taking on Anya's kidnappers while reminding himself as to why he became a spy in the first place... It just hits different. The episode does a good job with that scene as is, but it's got so much more impact after learning about what he specifically went through with the war.
LOID FORGER YOU LITERALLY DESERVE BETTER 😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Gonna prepaed the tissues.iam going to lose so much tears.
Children in gaza back story: * it is not back story it is happening irl*
Loid once play Football ⚽️ and he scored a goal
Oh my god that's so sad 😭😭
Are they pulling a jujutsu Kaisen where half of the seasons arcs are full of wholesome stuff and then the rest of the action just gonna be tragedy
AUUGHH I'm sobbing!!
Back story time lets go!
The first of the depressing War arcs  begins!  Yep, there's more of them.
No wonder Loid cherishes Yor and Anya so much. Even if he claims it's just "for the mission".
Comeon complete the story
I am surprised that they didn't make this arc into a movie
Oh  Oh god no  This is going to be this generation’s Nina Tucker.
This season is boutta be legendary
I'm really looking forward to this spy x family
Can't wait to know twilights real name
I know that I am gonna cry😢😢
Happy music with sad lyrics in a happy slice of life anime based on Berlin West vs East from 1961-1989 is wild
can someone let me know when the first episode has been released on it
Se vienen las lágrimas.
0:16 why did happy music start playing at this part😭
Is this the first episode? Because I've heard from other people that the first episode isn't his backstory but just filller
Crunchyroll is now working with an Israeli company for AI subs. Boycott this tone deaf company
Spy before the family
The song does not match the scene 😭
Im not watching until these people either fall in love or they find out the child can read minds
What time does this come out?
THE 1ST IS NOT EVEN OUT YET WHAT THE HEL
Young Loid is so cute. So excited for this one.
people be crying about a fictional character backstory but not actual children in such conditions irl
So this how Lloyd became...Lloyd. ngl, the trauma he had to go through is Hard if not Harsh. I'm Glad he has a wife and Kid who loves him unconditionally.
Looks like we are going to deep dive in Loid’s background. I heard it’s going to be very depressing and a contrast to the usual zany antics the Spy X Family is known for. 😯
How is nobody talking about how this trailer is just attack on titan final season part 1?
Can’t wait believe it ❤🥳
SPITZ AS OPENING is CRAZY
People act shocked by Loid’s childhood, but the children of Gaza have suffered this a thousand times.  Free Palestine! Pray for Palestine.
This was sad asf
Hey, you guys for got to add subtitles to the second episode of a wild last boss appears. Why am i here telling you this on your latest random video; but you don’t make it easy for me to contact support and you deleted your community feeds!

Gear up with tissues, folks😢
spy x family seasons have started to come faster than episodes of some animes Ah fck, I remember this part
We’re gonna cry with this one ya’ll 😭
Chaos
I wonder if we'll ever learn his real name. I'm sure it starts with either L or R, since they're the same letter/sound in Japanese, and when using an alias, some people pick a name that starts with the same letter as their real name to trick their own minds into responding to it better. And all of his fake names have started with either L or R.
wow Loid san was going to be in the army when he is a kid before and tragic of the war before
SPY x FAMILY : Poland Edition

Que maravilla a diferencia de Kana de oshi no ko ya que Kana se acostó con un director casado y con hijos solo por un papel en una película y golpeó el cadáver de Aqua en su funeral frente a los familiares y amigos de Aqua y antes de eso le dijo a Aqua que nunca lo amó en el capitulo 107 de oshi no ko
