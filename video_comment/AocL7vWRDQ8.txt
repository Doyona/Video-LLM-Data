Keyshawn is the worst man.  Get someone else FS1
Skip cant even catch his dman breath when talking about lebron like slow down old man
I love the new undisputed sound track
Oh stop it with the lakers fan girling. Wtf is wrong with these analysts.
Got shot is crazy 🤣🤣🤣
Paul pierce is such a good addition !!! Much more balanced view …. As well as Rachael  Very good show!!
i think after when lebron retires paul pierce aint no business to skip show no more, he got hired over there just to be skip companion on hatin lebron :D
OH NO SKIP MENTIONED THE WHEELCHAIR POOP GAME
It doesn't mean anything if they don't win the chip💯💯💯💯
Don’t ever get rid of Paul Pierce, saved this show. His dynamic is great. Problem is he can’t talk football
Shannon leaving is a blessing in disguise cuz all he and skip talks abt is lebron
Keyshawn had a smirk when Skip mentioned the "wheelchair game" lol
Unc Pierce the truth will never lie
Cupcake era!!
yes lakers lead all time,and that made game good and intresting,and hawe to give respect to Lakers for that..but that just looks and seams that lakers had a beter chance,thats just because Denver get lose and not so focused all game,they just know theyr beter,they are to strong..
And this is why the nuggets are motivated. They see the media talk about the Lakers all the time but they are the world champs and the media is not putting any respect on name last time I checked the l nuggets the last time I checked the Lakers did not come off a championship so it seems disrespectful that you talk about the Lakers and all the time as if we're not capable of repeating
😅 not a basketball fan but  I had so much fun watching the Lakers go splat.
Paul Pierce makes Keyshawn bearable, even more fun.
Lakers need to get rid of Lebron, his best years are over
🔥
lol paul still got hate for lbj 🤣🤣🤣
The Wayne verse was 🔥 🔥 🔥
Lbj wasn't in the position to challenge Murray when lbj was in the position to challenge Murray lol
Porter is skinny!!! Stop! That was normal contact!!!! Stop!
Ad avg 3 pts in the last 4 - 4th quarters. Injury??? Lol he was using that arm in the 4th to defend, so pls. Plus Murray had a strained calf. And are you serious?  They had to take ad to the locker room???  Did they give ad quick shoulder surgery, too??? Lmao
Mike Malone didn’t even say he was the Lakers dad
Keyshawn are you for real, son? Lbj rages that he didn't challenge! So what you want him to do in that situation in an elimination game. Btw, y'all lost that challenge. It was a foul
Keyshawn is Just as bad as shannon sharp and nick wright and all those other lebron jock sniffing morons
Never seen a group of people struggle with a full sentence more lol
Get rid of the Keyshawn dude. Hes boring, takes himself too seriously.  Paul pierce brings props, even if it is a used raggidy broom. Lol
Paul Pierce in the wheelchair game..... He wasn't hurt he crapped his pants.
Dunking on LeBron with a strained calf is cold 🥶
It's replay's fault. Thankfully, replay saved all the GOATS. MJ, BIRD, MAGIC, KAREEM and all the rest could always count on replays to win. Blaming replay and self proclaiming your the GOAT when all the other GOATS never had replay is ridiculous.
Please don't talk about AD being hurt..... KCP and Murray were both hurt.
Plz fire Keyshawn
Paul stop hating on LBJ you can never compare to LBJ or an AD it take an team to win and Denver have a better team its embarrassing that Denver had them struggles with beating a half LA they going home in Minnesota
Keshawn mad asl 😂😂
I'm liking Keyshawn VS Pierce debate battles. Keyshawn give it to Paul.
Skip is boring without Uncle Shay Shay
Steph Curry ruined the game denver isn't really that good they a 2pt and free throw team they play like the nba did before the 3pt shot was invented everyone shoots 3pt shots rather then 2s u miss a 3 they make a 2 duh!!! Old school play
Am I the only one who heard skip say "Austin Reaves came real close to putting fingertips on balls" 17:32 😂😂😂
90s bulls would have destroyed any of Lebrons teams. Well oiled machine with triangle offence, lock down Doberman number 1 ranked defence. Michael Jordan as the precious Jewell in the dynasty crown.
Loving Paul on this show
I like when Rachel Nichols is hosting the show.
NOW YOUTUBE HAS COMMERCIALS THAN CONTENT WTF MAN
Keyshawn “too small” Johnson celebrating injuries. Yeah take that L on the way out!
LeBron had all the help he needed, but he's just not good enough. It's time to retire. Or he should go back to the eastern conference since that's the only place where he can actually win at least one series. The self proclaimed "GOAT" can't win more than one game with a top 75 hall of famer teammate that played very well. I hope people finally realize that he isn't what he proclaims himself to be.
My hope for the season was to work on Jaxson Hays development, he could be a great defensive big he's very athletic and could have matched Aaron Gordon or perhaps bring back the two big lineup the Lakers had with their championship run in 2020
The nuggets are just better
Paul Pierce freakin funny man 🤣 that who's your daddy shirt hit keyshawn
I used to hate Paul Pierce cuz of all that talking he used to do to only win 1 ring. But Lakers fans especially Keyshawn have been getting on my nerves so much and they never want to give Denver any credit that they are significantly better.
That intro to crazy 😂🔥🫳
Keyshawn trying to analyze NBA is like me trying to do astrophysics on a chalkboard
These new hosts they have to replace Shannon are terrible by comparison. Can we get some people with a little juice left in the tank?
If AD didn't get hurt then the Lakers..  If the refs did their jiob properly this game is not close.
Paul Pierce is great
No mention of Jokic's 0 for 0 from the FT line. 🤔
I'm a big laker fan and I'm happy I missed game 5
Skip can finally retire like his supposed arch rival lebum james
::checks Lakers roster::  Keyshawn, you're not, nor have you ever been, on the Lakers. Quit saying "we."  You are supposed to be a professional analyst.
Did Skip just say "Whatever " to Dame Lillard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Been watching for years but I’m just now subscribing because Paul The Truth is on here!
Don't forget to acknowledge MPJ's greatness also
Someone like Dennis Rodman
Paul deserves better than dumb and dumber. Id love a Paul and sharpe show
Y'all need to put respect on key name he makes valid points he's not a yes man
These guys don’t deserve to talk basketball with Paul Pierce, and you can tell how dumb PP think’s these guys are
AD acted like he got shot. Lol Him and LeBron are a perfect match. Glad they are done.
LeBron and the Lakers 2016-2020 4 times sent home 2021-2024 sent home 7 seasons sent home this is the g o.a.t?
No one wants to appreciate the fact joker had 25,20,9 and had a bad game
I like how Jamal is getting the recognition he deserves. Jokic is not taking away his shine, and letting Jamal be Jamal.  If they win another ring. it would be great to see Jamal hold that FMVP tropjy
Only watch when Pierce is on the show. He saving this show
Key is aaaaaawful. Get him off this show.
what's with the random microphone at 5:35 ??
Skip stop letting Keyshawn waste this show away.  He is embarrassing.  His scripted takes without being able to defend the stance he's been giving is killing you
The biggest reason this show doesn’t work is because these guys aren’t really mates.  If you look at First Things First, they’re all genuinely mates. It makes the show so much more engaging when they’re friends off air
ITS never Leborns fault they always blame AD sad.
Paul Pierce..has all the street cred..with suave and insight and good common sense....PP is SS v2...
If that's Paul Pierce's perspective, then, LeBron is also his daddy.
Skip bringing  up the time the truth  took a dump in his droors 😂😂😂
This show barely relevant no credibility  with skip...and the truth been fired loaded high as f on espn  national  broadcast  lol...
Everbody needs to GO..Except Labron and Reeves..Nobody else got heart.
Rui Hashimoto couldnt box out my Grandma ...and shes dead!
Why don't Keyshawn realize his Lakers will never beat The Nuggets as long as KING JOKIC is in uniform
shut up noth of you the wolves will your nuggets haha
Serbian school of basketball. Position 1-5 are most important. Establish that line,and everything else fulfill with some  qualities player and you will have a machine. Simply Denver is a machine. Greetings from Serbia
Dudes getting a lineup with their hairline running away is wild
Key is better then sherman
No love for joker . Wheres his segment
Show fell off since Shannon left but I must say skip has the best intro of all shows
2 missed free throws lebron game 5. And 1 big missed one game 2 with 3 min left
Paul Pierce must be thinking to himself ...  A clown to the left of me A joker to the right Here I am stuck in the middle with you 🎶🎶🎶
Dragging that shoulder like it broke.. soft
6:50 Keyshawn sounds like someone keeps hitting the pause button,or like there's a lag..
I truly believe the 2nd half (but especially the 4th qtr) is the difference maker for the Nuggets. I think the Denver elevation & thinner air really gives them an advantage over other teams who aren't used to it & get so gassed in the 2nd half. It's seems so obvious when watching Denver play at home.
Bruh they sorry 😔 let's move on
Key a 100% right don’t challenge early in the game
Please take key off basketball takes, he is legit running out of things to say and just blabbering about whatever.
I’m sorry, but nobody has hotter takes than Skip Bayless. He has the hottest takes and they are truthfully valid. Those other guys are just rambling and probably didn’t even really watch the game, and he comes in and you know why it’s his show.
Lakers suck! I am looking forward to the day they get rid of lebron.
Keyshawn, very emotional.   Karma comes for those that wish for wins due to the other teams players get injured in the prior game.  Karma
keyshawn should not be analyzing any NBA basketball game
The lakers were never close. The refs kept them in it with h 3 times the number of free throws.   Pisses me off that these so-called specialists never talk about that.
Magic Johnson said: "And the #1 reason the Lakers can't beat Denver in a 7 game series is because the Nuggets are mentally and physically tougher than the Lakers." Lakers fans are saying "would we have won had AD not gotten injured?"  Nuggets fans are saying, "how many points would we have won by had Jamal Murray played uninjured?"
If Keyshawn keeps checking Skip’s BS takes, Paul Pierce keeps being a menace and Skip keep bringing the wheelchair incident then id watch this everyday
Paul got me warching again .. great addition lol funny stuff.
They played as a team.  Thats the nuggets key to victiry agiants the lakers  To thinknthatnrefs help them😂😂😂
AD is a choke artist! He does that all the time, sets up an excuse as soon as he feels any shift in momentum. He's not a franchise player, end of.
How to settle the goat debate.   Google, “which player has the most nba finals losses”
Stop it, Lakers already Gone Fishin!
Jokic gets 20 boards and never gets fouled?  Amazin!
well it seems Paul Pierce  never got over those years in Boston when Lebron was cooking them
Love Paul's statement "twelve out of thirteen is not close"...
Lebum not the goat 🐐
I love how they write off the Timberwolves and they do have experience on that team, difficult seeing Denver beating them in a 7 Game series
KJ
Skip always try to be politically correct when the Lakers lose🤷🏽‍♀️. They are so confusing🤷🏽‍♀️
Hey Wayne I need a verse the show is dying
That turnover bron has which might’ve been his only one was costly
Keyshawn makes me tune right out. He's terrible.
The look on Keyshawn face when Skip said "the wheelchair game" lol. We all know PP let one rip in his gear during the game 😂
He wished Murray was hobbled and AD was hobbled
Y'all was satisfied with Lakers winning one and not getting swept🤷
key was mad lol i love paul
Small market teams gonna dominate NBA next 10 years
Why Skip all of a sudden start to defend LeBron queen?
3 AD truths. He's hurting (maybe injured). He's soft. He can't stand LeBron
The only thing that Paul hurt during the Wheelchair Game was his colon
Keyshawn is talking nonsense. Who's the idiot put him on this show?
If Vanderbilt was playing we would've had a better chance than having Dlo out there doing nothing. So Pierce has no clue on this one topic.
Skip is hilarious. Said he went down like he got shot lol
I don't want to hear any injury bs when the T-Wolves show up
New Big Three !
Who cares 4-1 talk about that
Bron shouldn't challenge all these calls and the last one was afoul should have been Denver ball
Celtic green who's Ur daddy shirt is like the Celtics hopping on the nuggs bandwagon. Haha
I've never seen these ppl talk ect cold a been AR almost had a fingertip on it you can trek the told to talk talk talk Lakers ok they lost move on
S/O Skip for his patience cuz lord knows he be wantin to cut Key and Paul off and state his opinion.
Keyshawn talks too much
I’m starting to like Undisputed again
If the Lakers would have played anyone else. Yea yea yea, they lost!!!
Yall put some respect on Skip they getting the views up ! F ESPN and first take
I don’t know why
Why the f are we still talking so much about the lakers… did KJ just say the lakers are close?
Too much expectation from AD. lol They forgot that he is a no show in the series in the 2nd half of every game.
Maybe Lebron’s focusing on bigger things. Like his legal defense from the upcoming P Diddy trials…” Ain't no party like a P Diddy party” right Lebron?
There were 27 free throws for the road team to the home team’s 9 and the Lakers still lost. You can say AD was hurt but Jamal might not have played in that game either. A blown call on Reaves that gave the ball back to the Lakers. So even when the refs are trying to cheat for the Lakers, they still lost! 😂   We got Magic Johnson tweeting Minnesota and OKC will only get better which is true. I think Denver and Minnesota will rule the West for years to come similar to the Lakers and Spurs from 1999-2010. Ant is only 22. There could be another 12+ years of him ruling the West. Ant can lead his team to a Finals at 22, or the same age as LeBron in June of 2007.  Lakers got nothing. They can go get whoever and they’re still not surpassing Denver and Minnesota. Media needs to help create a superteam for LeBalco because their Lakers can’t beat two teams who aren’t considered a superteam as they drafted all their best players. They did it the right way. Not the way Lakers and my Clippers did it by teaming up stars.   I can’t wait for LeBum to retire. Will not miss him and the media wanting to talk about him every single day. And I knew this would happen back in summer of 2017 before he joined the Lakers a year later. He was just waiting for Kobe to retire to glaze on Jeanie’s face. And Jeanie will do whatever it takes to keep him because it’s big business for her.  Failed to box out and get the defensive rebound which led to a Murray three in Game 5. Failed to hit a wide open three in Game 2. Failed to hit free throws missing 9 of those 27 when the refs were practically giving the game to you to win. But let’s forget all that. Blame the coach. Fire him. Trade everyone not named LeBron. Draft Bronny to keep his dad.   Press reset all over again so the media can keep talking about the same things all over again. Same Bron time. Same Bron channel.
Please get rid of keyshawn!
Has Keyshawn played a pickup basketball game ever? Like at 19:30, how does he know whether that impacted the shot or not? He seems to be guessing, with a lot of confidence.
THE LE LAKERS AND THERE SO CALLED LEADER ARE THE BUGGEST LE CRYBABIES AND DIVAS LIKE THERE LEADER LE CHOKE CANT SHOOT FOR SH.T JAMES NOTHING BUT A LE CLOWN SHOW
I like the Nugs but they are not the same team as last year.  If they get by the T pups, it’s gonna take everything out of them
Explain how you lose a timeout when u won the challenge? Nobody's talking about it.
It's been the same way every game, lebron shows up, and everybody else disappears. A.d had 1 point in the second half, Russell went 2 for 10 , if you get that from your 2nd and 3rd option you gone lose.
Paul had to keep his composure. I don't know what's wrong with Keyshawn lol
Pierce>Shermans dry throat ahh 😂
They tried to cancel Paul but GOD DID!!!
Matchups matter. Sac beat Den multiple times but could never beat the Pels
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!!
Is it just me or keyshawn Johnson doesn't know anything about basketball ad chickened out in the fourth quarter it's that simple that's why unfortunately the ratings have gone down on this show because of keyshawn Johnson
Paul Pierce is straight foward no bias. Finally
The Lakers need a closer! Someone who can score in the end of games. Lebron is closer, but he's an all-round closer. He defends, facilitates, and scores if need be, but he is not a natural score. That's why him and Kyrie played so well together. He played to his strengths and allowed Kyrie to handle the scoring load. The Joker does it, too. He gets his points, assist, and rebounds, but Murray is the closer. Porter is coming on strong also. The Lakers don't have that guy consistently!
MPJ was like prime Klay!!! Pulling from ANY and EVERYWHERE
You have to get rid of Keyshawn
i think pierce thinks Lakers are in the eastern conference🤣 even than
The fact is the had that time out last year and they blocked lebron final shot.  Denver is just a better team
Well there definitely wasnt a strained calf so that was fake news
Dude frustrated 😂 they need Dwight howard AD asking
LeBron doesn't have sportsmanship. When they lost he just walks out like cmon shake some hands accept defeat! All the greatest accept defeat but nope he just walks out while his team shows sportsmanship!
Skip is a defined Culture Vulture! THIS SHOW WOULDNT BE RELEVANT WITHOUT THE SAME GUYS OPINIONS HE BELITTLES EVERY SINGLE EPISODE
Nuggets didnt defended at all. With a little effort they would swepp Lakers 25 points ahead each game. (Maybe they choose not to defend because of the refs 🤷🏻‍♂️)
LeBum is a joke. Is horrible. 😱😱😱
Clown Johnson and Skip Ballless always wrong and rooting for the Lakers to win.  Good thing Paul Pierce is here to give some TRUTH!
It's not a surprise the NFL & NBA 2023 Champions are the 2024 back-to-back Champions shhh!
Paul and skip chemistry is reminding me of him and Shannon. Love to see Paul featured, It got me watching again.
Jamal Murray would be great for team USA his play fits perfect especially breaking down a zone
When key talks I turn down the volume. I can't stand to hear this man talk LOL. Listening to  makes me feel smart
LBJ sucks
WHOS YOUR DADDY!!
Keyshawn is the reason this show sucks now. Fire Him! Keep Paul Pierce, please!!!
Keyshawn looks like he wants to cry...lol🤣🤣🤣🤣
Paul think he cool with that patch of gray hair 😂
Yawl let's get for real Denver has a way better team and the lakers could have been up damn near 3-1  headed back to LA but hey they won the series will see ya next year with a better coach/better team
Lakers need the first round exit trophy 😂😂
You can tell in this episode Paul pierce is being some what humble and appearing to lessen the pain for Keyshawn after joshing him the whole time. That's good chemistry and a sneak peek. Of what diversification means .
actually REFEREES are trying to help LeBurger King on not getting Swept They have too much "FreeThrows" in every game 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who's LeBron daddy? 😂
Wont lie I’m here for Pierce and will stay for Pierce 😂 so props to whoever was responsible for the hire!
Can’t wait until keyshawn stops advocating for the lakers for the rest of the playoffs
I like and luv this man , @paulpierce my GOD he is 201% correct!! We are talking about Denver and lakers and not winning championships 😳😂🤐🤣🥲
Why is no one talking about? Why LeBron poked the bear ,shrugging his shoulders,tryna flex that's why  murray started shrugging his shoulders ,😂
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THATS HOLY:  FIRE KEYSHAWN JOHNSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HE IS INSUFFERABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!🙏
Lakers were missing 3 of their best defenders through the season and playoffs; Vanderbuilt (starter), Reddish, Vincent (potential starter- back too late to start, also a good shooter).   This could have made a difference in Murray’s game winning shots, and in replacing Anthony Davis when hurt, as well as resting LBJ a few minutes per game.   I would like to see them run it back with the same team with two hopes; 1. LBJ can take off more time/games; letting the younger players develop, and 2. Picking up another talented forward like Jerami Grant from Portland, to help towards resting LbJ.   It would be nice to see LBJ take lower pay towards winning a title with his son.
Keyshawn one of the worst basketball talk head on tv give me a break!
Skip wild 😅😅😅😅😅 ad went down like he got shot
Aaron Gordon isnt getting enough praise. The dude is denvers best defender and hes a rebound king 👑. A lot of credit to MPJ as well
T Wolvs in 6. Joker vs Towns&Gobert Jamal vs Ant  MPJ vs McDaniels.
Yes Murray made two big shots at the end of the 4th that won the Nuggets two games in this series. But MPJ was a big reason also Denver won this series. He averaged 20 plus points per game.
Talk about why they don't play defense and just let Murry shoot
A.D. went down like he was shot.... 😂😅😊
Why Keshawn Neva looks Paul Pierce in the eyes🤔
I actually get what Skip is saying and appreciate Keys take.   But it's valid man... 😂
I thought this show was done when Shannon left but Pierce and Keyshawn are great additions. The show is BACK!
That guy on the left shouldn’t be able to talk about basketball, worst contributor ever.
I enjoyed this segment 👍🏼
The referees played great this game fr
It’s the intro of Wayne for me! ❤
Still got 3sec to go and Bron dribbles left with no room to go anywhere and straight into Joker😂 No right hand🫣
That intro is fire
Paul Peirce is very insightful and knowledgeable and articulate!!
Pp is hilarious but he’s right about Denver being lakers daddy 😂
How’s the LeExcuses😂
Lebron and AD we’re building in their excuses for when they lose lol
Bad LeLoser once again. Still couldn’t win without all the refs help🫣
Stopped watching the show when Keyshawn replaced Shannon, but Paul making it a bit more interesting again.
MPJ is the Lakers killer...He was making timely shots..the Lakers dont have anybody to guard him
Skip to Pierce: “I still don’t know how hurt you were in your wheel chair game “😭😭😭😭he wasn’t hurt he had to use the restroom 😂😂
Lebron is not a point guard. Lebron needs a good pointguard like wade, irving and rondo.
KD to the Lakers this off-season... gotta help LeBron.
Locker room discontent
To Lebron’s discredit he didn’t box out Aaron Gordon (something taught in grade school) with the game on the line and no one can convince me that if it were Kobe or Jordan playing they would have DEMANDED to guard Jamaal on that last play.
Paul, very day, looking more and more like Steven A. lately.
What happened to Paul when he was in Brooklyn? He lost. Why?
Was keyshawn laughing at the wheelchair scenario Knowing damn well he just pooped on himself
Lekeyshawn can you stop saying we and talk about the game smh 🤦
Thanks Paul for saving the show
Jokic Murray Malone shouldn't forget to thank Lakers Coach & Front Office for helping them advance.  Had Lakers switch coaches with Nuggets, Lakers would easily sweep the Nuggets.  Great Coaches like Malone, Snyder, Nurse are underrated who Craftily Exploits the Weaknesses of Lakers Rookie Coach again & again. Lakers Coach got Checkmated repeatedly thus wasting the Heroics Sacrifices of LeBron & AD while breaking the hearts of millions of Lakers fans.
@11:16  “And AD goes down like he got shot!”   Skip is a Menace and I love it 😂
Coach Malone knew all along Murray will play.   Murray being questionable was a psychological tactic. 🤓
Key could been lawyer lol
Everytime it’s skips turn I go to the next video
Skip Murray is 100 times better the Lebron down the stretch 😂
Lebron James being knocked out of round one sustains me
Is that Zion's long lost brother?😳😅
Man the Lakers gave this series away. So sad
MPJ the reason the Nuggets won.
Without Paul Pierce today, those two boxer sniffing jokes would have came up with every excuse made to man. Let’s blame the cater because she didn’t bring Lebron the shrimp and grits he asked for and he had to have his shrimp and grits 😂😂😂😂😂
Vando and Reddish both ‘defensive’ players of Darvin Ham are disasters. Can only give you 4-6 points yet the guy they’re defending has 20+ pts wtf is that?
We got to give undisputed some likes ❤. I think skip found something with Paul Pierce 👍🏽
if AD was teamed with the likes of Paul Pierce instead of LBJ, they will win, real talk
Why is there such bias in this show? May as well be a Lakers show.
I hate to say it but this is one time he 💯💯💯on everything he says in this😂😂😂😂, no lies
Reminds me if Randy Moss. If you even, he leavin. 😂
Hey Paul Pierce,( Laker hater )  shouldn't your "Who's Your Daddy" teeshirt be blue and gold? WTF do the Celtics got to do with this series?
They would not of beat ANY OTHER TEAM lol they wouldnt of beat Warriors.
Paul Pierce 👍👍
PP constantly clowning Key for the Whos your daddy at the end 😂
Skip Bayless is boring to see.. Paul Pierce gives energy in this show
Paul is too happy James lost, but mind you James is wayy better got more rings and still play not sit and talk 😉
Pierce laughed at KeShawn all Bron fans always got a reason he can’t win and will say the better team won lol
Wayne killed🔥🔥🔥 That intro JEEZ!
The challenge rule needs tweaking. If a challenge is good, why shd I loose a timeout????  Loosening a timeout wld seem fair if only it was wrong? But if it's right, then why shd I be penalized for wht the Refs Missed??!?!?!??
AD soft like pillowy soft cotton on a cozy blanket
AD soft like My Pillow
It now feels like Paul Pierce is just bringing his little brother to the set to meet Skip 😂
AD soft like extra soft charmin
Haven’t seen this show in a minute and I can clearly see why. Switch to my man Shay pls.
LeChoken one did it again    That dude is zero clutch 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Paul Pierce makes this show now
it’s basic and simple: this is a team game with 5 members but AD and Lebron were just lifting the rest of the younger members wtf - young but not hungry to win (reality is the King needs to drop the team and coach)
Paul Pierce doing his best Skip Bayless impersonation, why don't you get a grip.
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the Lakers lost. But it makes no damn sense that you lose a timeout even if you challenge and get it right. That's not the way it works in any other sport, and for a reason. It punishes you for having to correct the officials. It makes no sense and should be changed immediately.
I like this trio.
Paul Pierce a fool😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lebron age 39 in year 21 played 77 games this season averaged career high 41% from 3 in year 21 he was 54% from the field his highest since 2017-18 season with Cavs   he averaged career high 2.5 steals a game in the playoffs this year he shot 39% from 3 his highest since 2016-17 season with Cavs   he was 28-9-7 in the playoffs with 2.5 steals and shot 57% from field and 39% from 3 at age 39 in the playoffs   what lebrons has done this season will never be achieved by another basketball player at that age what you have witnessed this season is special   yes he lost no shame losing to Jokic the best player in the NBA and Nuggets best team in the world
It’s crazy how little they talk about Jokic on these shows. If someone didn’t watch the games they’d assume Jokic was a solid role player not the best player in the world.
"Could have won but we missed our free throws." Game isn't close if the referees don't keep the Lakers in the game with 27 free throws.
I have seen the hit Michael Porter did on AD , the excuse Lakers fans uses for the reason they lost . Saw it and he barely even touched him for him to get hurt . Just only shows you how weak today's N.B.A is compared to the Michael Jordan era . Specially when we have coaches and teacher telling them to sell  fouls so they can try get more points , even fouls that don't exists . Especially the fake ones.
Paul pierce is a certified Bron hater
Thank goodness for Paul Pierce man someone being real
When it comes down too it Denver beat the lakers the same way they beat them in the 2020 with the front court players plus rando and Alex Caruso was essential in defense  and playmaking!
Players cant be coaches. Thst last challenge killed their time out all bacause bron told ham to chañlenge thus losing the game
Fire that clown!
CORNY
Paul Pierce you nailed it.👏👏👏👏👏 Lebroom going to Cancun baby.🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹
Lakers lacked defense, period. No defense = can win!
Paul Pierce - keep doing what you’re doing!
Paul is great for this show!
Does it get any worse than Keyshon? He’s like nails on a blackboard
People still watch this show? 😂
Key sucks at this lol
❤❤❤❤❤ lil
23:49  Just to be clear, Michael Malone NEVER said anything about being the Lakers daddy.  It was local radio personality Vic Lombardi who said that when he was introducing Michael Malone at the end of the parade.
People keeps saying AD is a HOF and top 5 today … in my opinion, AD’s career would be finished jnder 1 of Shaq’s monstrous dunk !!
not the would’ve should’ve, could’ve
PLAYOFF MURRAY IS HIM!! I called it Denver in 5 games. There was no way the Lakers were getting swept back to back years. Jokic played great and score a lot of points without free throws. The refs really kept the Lakers in the game shooting 27 free throws compared to Denver 9. The Lakers won championship in December the IST was a joke and the Lakers should hang out “didn’t get swept by Denver in 2024” banner
Skip, where is your Murray stoper, Gabe Vincent??? You dumb, ignoramus, quasi ”sport analyst”. Go retire man!!!
Lmao the wheelchair game for Paul hahaha he said he wasnt hurt he just pooped himself
Keyshawn = 🤡
Skip bring Keyshawn on the show during the NFL season cause his basketball knowledge is not there.
I hate to admit it but I do like this ensemble.
What's wrong Keychump did Murray make you swallow your words?
Skip is right..malone is in control of his team! In other words bron doesn't want a coach to control him...smh..
Lakers are not close...give it a rest.
Paul Pierce is a great basketball mind. ESPN really set him up asking those ridiculous questions and having him look like a clown, instead giving him a chance to show his basketball knowledge.
If u get there and don’t win it, they gon be yo damn daddy😂😂😂
DLo always disappears in the playoffs. Always rooting for him, but it's getting harder and harder.
I truly miss Skip and Shannon
"Are you done? " "Yeah im done, here you go bro" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What an intro !! Well done
Paul speaks the truth
Jamal's dunk on LeBron and then giving him the shoulder role 💀
I hate to say this but this show is so damn dry. Nothing is light hearted, funny, or bro like. This feels like these guys are at work. Keyshawn is a diplomat with no personally and way too serious. Sports is fun. But listening to Keyshawn’s stoic, sterile, and occasionally arrogant commentary is like pulling teeth. Stick a fork in this show….I think it’s almost done. Dam.
Pierce w the who’s your daddy shirt is so corny, like dude it’s definitely not boston😂😂
Was Keysean laughing when Skip mentioned the wheel chair?? 😅
Autotuned lil wayne intro. Omfg 🙄 Bubuye
Kshawn and nick write should be in one segment lol... they are salty lol....
What will this show be about now that Lebron and the Lakers are out.🤔🤔🤔
GET PAUL ON 100% the time
17:37 Pause Skip 😂
Paul peirce sounds dumb who's your daddy? LeBron sitting with owners nobody on denver nuggets team, coaches and gms included. Can sit in the same seat. LeBron is they're daddy and yours.
It's their fault for not throwing the Pels' game to match up with OKC.
I know he cant help how hes built but its just funny asl hearing skip talk about fighting through an injury in the nba or nfl and hes just some small 60 something year old who never played lol
AD = ALWAYS DISAPPEARING 😂 👻
Paul and Key sporting Leslie Jones hairstyles 😂
No one has mentioned Vando, which is the Lakers' best defender, and can guard anyone
Paul wasn’t hurt , he pooped on his self . Lol
0 free throws for the worlds best player Let that sink in
Undisputed really changed their specialty field
Lebum should retires now
Paul is right..Lakers couldve beaten anyone if they didnt play Denver..thats exactly what happened to lebron 10 finals..he was lucky enough to avoid the best teams and only lost in finals..imagine he had to play the champion first like Denver..he couldnt hv gone to finals so many times..
Skip knows who to bring to make the show exciting
LeBron is Paul's daddy😂
Keyshawn still ain’t apologized for celebrating Jamal Murray being hurt! Disgraceful!!! Smh
Paul is a player hater of the highest order
Poop game💀
This show needs a moderator. Get Jay Crawford in there since skip seems to bump heads with the lady mods. Skip and jay seemed to work well together on first take together
Who’s your daddy?
Keyshawn makes my hears hurt 😂so annoying
The biggest story and the only reason the game was even close is the refs trying to fix the game 27 for LA 9 for Denver joker didn’t even go to the line once !!!!!
This is crazy You Win 4 out of 5 game's and all they do is talk about the Lakers 🤦
Did anyone mention Jokic? Listening for 8 minutes now
Aaron Gordon made two spectacular plays for Denver. In game two, he caught a bad desperation pass from Jokic, straddled the baseline, and passed the ball back out to Porter, Jr., who made a 3-pointer, tying the game at 95. Yesterday, he got an offensive rebound and passed the ball back out to Murray, who made a 3-pointer, giving the Nuggets a 2-point lead. Gordon's play in game 3 won it for Denver.
Lebron cost them that game. The way he cried for that challenge with 3 min left knowing they didn't have anymore time outs. they get the ball back but they didn't score off that challenge. So after that big last second shot they could have called a time out but they had to rush the ball up cause no timeout.
Paul needs to be permanent
idc who or what happened letrash James is eliminated!
They act like they won the chip??? 😂
TALK ABOUT THIS 👇👇👇👇👇 27 free throws  GIFTED TO THE  FAKERS vs 9 for DENVER
LaGone 🎉
Key is talking Basketball to a literal NBA champion in Paul Pierce😅
Paul pierce one ring ahh happy asf 😂
We'll see how the Nuggets vs Timberwolves series goes. It almost seems as if the Nuggets match up against the Lakers in a way that other teams just don't.
Tough it out AD, you're getting paid  a lot of money 💰 get it done, no excuses injury, in the post season everyone is playing with some injuries
Paul be having me crying 😂😂
Pierce is FREAKIN GOLD! Maaan? This is a different show with him on board. Great! Refreshing!
The phony goat went home Good morning 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅wessy f s done!!!!!!
Yes, let’s cry about why LAL lost😢😢
I honestly hate Paul pierce
Paul and Skip have great chemistry, keep it up!
This show is so boring
wait.. if they are banging shoulder to shoulder every play, then that would mean the nba is actually physical now? because all the haters say theres no contact or defense lol
Skip talking about that wheel chair game 😂
The roster of Lakers is good. Just fire Darvi Ham, take an experienced Head Coach and this roster can go deeper to the finals next year.
Key, Skip, Paul, Michael, Rachel...they rising, getting in the groove...never doubt a determined group.
Paul hates Lebron so much 😂😂
It took them a year to gain 10k subscribers
Paul spoke facts about Vando being the difference, the issue was Bron and AD always started fast and didn’t get Dlo and AR involved early enough to get a rhythm. The nuggets didn’t opposite. The stars got the other involved early and that allowed them to take over late. Mike Malone is a great coach and if it wasn’t for injuries the Nuggets may have been going for a 3rd next year. Murray and Porter Jr aren’t mvps put are just as important to the Nuggets success as the Joker is.
Paul pierce:got a green one for you who's your daddy keyshawn 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.                            Keyshawn but first you gotta get there first  paul.then you get there and denver beat y'all they gonna be your damn daddy. am boston die hard fan 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 but that was hilarious.
If you get there And don't win they gon be your damn daddy
A lot of IF from Skip and Keyshawn...
Murray played big in big moments but it's Jokic as always who was the best player on the floor. But as usual Skip will say that even bucket-boy had bigger impact on the game than Joke.
Keyshawn close doesn't count but in horseshoes and handgrenades.
Can you please stop showing those rappers Diddy people that glorify Sodoma and Gomorrah m. Our children are watching have some respect
Who’s your daddy!!! Lol
Please please  keep Paul pierce on the show
Stop calling Davis AD, there's only 1 real AD. Adrian Dantley the 1 and only. Davis is a buttercup.
This is the only time I’ve ever heard Skip Bayless be fair to a LeBron team not once did he mentioned LeBron choked or anything
Anthony ‘Gingerbread’ Davis
Stop the glazing. Jokic had a bad game, Murray was hurt, refs tried their best by giving Lakers 27 FTs. Still not enough.
Bro.. lebron jumping up and down a game ago while up 15 screaming for a challenge is why Ham challenged in a close game.
Lakers have as much talent as Nuggets, Paul. AD and Bron alone do that, but D'lo has been great on other teams and plays great in absence of Bron. AR has had some monster games, as well. The truth is, they haven't had the time together that Denver has to grow into a cohesive unit that bolster's each other's strengths and covers their weaknesses and that's on the Lakers.
Even nfl doesn't challenge in beginning of the game.
I’m w Skip…AD injury changed everything!
Stop. Nuggets over came larger deficits in the 3rd quarter. AD scored all of 16 points in 5 4qtr. Stop the excuses, they lost to a much better team.
“You’re my son” 😂😂😂😂
Keyshawn is a disaster! Sign him off. Now!
Michael Malone never said he was the Laker's daddy. That was local Denver sports analyst and announcer Vic Lombardi
Dam please get this man off the air when talking basketball key doesn't know anything about basketball let Paul and skip do this part bring key back for football
Darvin is a subpar coach. AD didnt make that statement for no reason......... 👈👈👈👈🎯🎯
I didn’t know Paul pierce is funny like this . Good show
Who's your daddy had Key tight 😂😂😂😂
Not watching unless he’s in a wheelchair.
What the Lakers shot 27 free throws to 9 to Nuggets on the road , the refs and the league was still trying to help them ,  reminds of Shaqs Lakers vs the Kings when they shot way more free throws
The Truth Happy AF Bron lost yet again 😂. I love it
Skip “I’ve been watching boxing since Muhammad Ali” Bayless, showing his boxing knowledge by not covering boxing since Mayweather’s last pro fight. Lmao he is a great actor tho
Y’all talking bout how Lebron got fouled like they didn’t shoot 3x more free throws than the Denver nuggets. Yall make me sick
5:13 LeBron got there and didnt win it 6 times😂 his fans think that's ok
This show is refreshing now because Pierce doesn't add any fluff bs, he's being authentic whether you disagree or not.
Skip said LeBron try another one and hit nothing but back board quote of the day
ngl that intro song was unexpected but kinda fire
Lebron is not a Hakeem Olajuwon who can dominate in 4th quarter on both sides of the floor and he gets his teammates involved
C'mon, Keyshaun, it's " ur not out the woods " not weeds. U must be thinking of ur college days and weeds.
Paul Pierce has brought enlightening TRUTH to Undisputed.
Lakers gone fishing
Lebalco Leflop Lebrick Leblame Lechoke Leprincess Lesorry Lecheat Lecry  Lebalco😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Paul Pierce have regain my interest in Undisputed.
Tf is paul doing did he not watch the game tf up with the obvious questions???
Keyshawn is unbearable. Fire him already.
AD unfortunately ...will be the Laker scapegoat-     which is awful  -   yes he went out 5min left...but inly because he emptied the tank up to that point-   Like averaging about 30 points and 12 ish boards...5 games??    ain't AD's fault-
I just know that Paul Pierce is one jealous guy of Lebron. I hear it in his dialogue and demeanor.
Denver had to beat the refs and the Lakers which it just goes to show you how good Denver is.😊
Why is "Lebron 30 pts" in the video title? That's LeMedia sh*t. The Nuggets beat the Lakers 8 of the last 9 playoff games the past 2 seasons while eliminating them both times. Lebron's point total is irrelevant.
Richard Sherman should only be on this show during the football season. Paul pierce is needed here and now
On in the mornin the Lakers have fallen, James is the goat..??? What a joke. Jordan is 6 and 0 you can't refute it , Jordan is the goat it's undisputed....good morning Lmao.
So skip wants the paw paw fruit
Keyshawn, whiny diva as a player. Ignorant whiny sports analyst. Get him off the show please. Every time I hear his voice, makes me want to turn on Night Cap instead.
The Lakers are the Dallas Cowboys of  basketball they are the best team  from all the bad teams
Ad the big winner, I think he took the dive and betted on denver
Denver hasn’t played their best ball in 2 weeks. Still 4-1.
Bye Bye LeRoid...🙋‍♂️
Darvin Ham completely fumbled the game at the end, stupid use of a challenge and a timeout gone. Imagine they had the TO and they can advance the ball upcourt and get a better shot
Game tied at. 99, Lakers go down and jacks up a three & misses, the Nuggets rebounds and Jokic goes straight in the post and score.  The Nuggets play the right way, they win games because the way they play.
They touched AD of course he was hurt
Paul definitely brings a "it" factor the show was missing. Not bad now💯
Paul Pierce still mad LeBron ended his career
Just bring in KG with Paul and this show will be fire
Love the chemistry
Watch Keyshawn a little after the 10:25 mark. When skip tells Paul we don't know how hurt you were in your wheelchair game. Keyshawn starts laughing. Becausebhe knows Paul was not hurt. He 💩 on himself. Skip knows that too. Lol
I will remember this for one day and forget the next day lol,but i will always remember LAKERS beating them all their career life time 🤣 lmao 🤣🤣 GO LAKERS!!!#18
For the love of God... when will Paul Pierce learn to stop hating on injured players. He of all people should KNOW that there are degrees of injury, even if it's "the same" injury.  Does he honestly think that Giannis would sit out if he could play without a high risk of greater injury, possibly affecting his CAREER?!   Come on man.... just stop comparing injuries and discrediting the player's character. That's weak.
Wanna laugh About jamal being injured now?!? Clowns 🤡
Slowly warming back up to this show, keep up doing your thing Skip and co.
Minnesota
It’s clear y’all never had a stinger or played Sports
I like Paul cause he doesn’t suck up to the lakers . I don’t think he likes lakers . I don’t like them never did and never will their jersey ugly
Fellas let's be honest. Lakers should have dumb Anthony Davis and got some hungry role players. Should have done before dumping Russ. The mistakes we make
Denver just spawned the last horrah super team : Steph n lebron definitely gonna be plotting on team USA lol
Key breakdown was amazing😮 he been on his s*** he do his homework much respect OG
Best intro song right now. Also, can Keyshawn be replaced with Rachel when it comes to basketball talk
Pierce is so funny btw boston is the first one to create a super team! because they cant do something to a rookie lebron
Paul loves it!  He dont like Lefool anyway!
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
I am still waiting for that Weezy ft Skip on a beat
Jamal is Canadian 🇨🇦....we don't "sit out" because we're sore ...that's Wuss United States behavior.    truth.
Lakers lose steam after the first half.
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
The FT was disgusting. 27-9 to the Lakers, Jokic 0 ft. If we had honest refs these series would be children's dance
Sorry but AD is just not tough man. In a do or die game you gotta  push through. Can’t go sit for 6 minutes in a game like this with a “injury” that clearly wasn’t serious since he was able to finish the game. He has no pain tolerance you gotta be able to push through when it’s do or die time that’s the difference between championships and no championships
Paul Pierce speaking the Truth. Pun intended. Get em Mayne!
AD was probably already hurting before he got injured. Instead of resting, he gambled and lost. I don't blame him. I blame the missed freethrows in the end. Those would have won the Lakers the game. Austin and Dinwiddie missed 4 points. These two dont miss freethrows! Would have been a perfect game.
Now can we stop talking about the Lakers and focus on all these young bulls ready to take over the league
Only here for the intro anyone else 😂😂😂
What a garbage game for Jokic; 25-20-9. Sarcasm. Let’s at least be honest; if any black player had these numbers, which are routine for Jokic, there would be non-stop accolades from every black sports talk show loudmouth.
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
No more goat talk it's over
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
So glad Denver put the Lakers out there misery so tired of the media praising Lebum like he is the Goat.
LAKERS!!!!
Paul at 24:00 😂
I need to clutch myself…😂
Can't front that intro is fire
I would argue Jamal is reason games were so close and they were down because he took basically 25-28 shots more than jokic and shot 40 and 28 from 3… sure he had big moments but to make it like he’s biggest reason in that game given all shots he bricked is like just looking at one piece of pie and not whole thing .. I would argue Porter was biggest and 2nd best player in series and I love Jamal but let’s be real if he don’t shoot better next series they will lose
PP = 🤡
Thought Murray won’t top 5 tho
Wayne intro still hit!
lol it’s sad when you gotta talk about what if such and such played… lol pierce should of stepped on bron neck even harder
Props to Nikola Jokić for not missing a free throw. 0/0. GREAT JOB, refs, but you couldn’t RIG this one— CREDIT TO COACH MALONE FOR HIS QUOTE.. Unlike the disingenuous POS in the comments below, I will credit the source.
I'm a die-hard Lakers fan but  Paul Pierce for MVP OF THE SHOW
where is shannon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Skip bcoming  legend, last  year  fool  now a gent...so
Trade AD build around bron then build around whoever we bring in
Get rid of keyshawn and keep paul pierce keyshawn so damn annoying
It’s was great 4-1 series felt like it was finals .
Paul be trolling 😭😭
Do I really want to listen to biased clown Lakers fans bemoaning how Lakers might have won if, if, if, IF . . .!!!!!
Free throws down the stretch cost LA this game
Keyshawn out here with a grocery list of excuses.  Karma.
I know jamal murrays clutch and game winners but for me aaron gordon is the unsung hero...
Keyshawn tight 😂😂😂
watching this game i’m just like damn lebron… you’re 39…. playing pretty well… but dosent matter because he’s going against the  2017 gsw.2 with jokic on istead of kd… mpj couldn’t miss a 3. jamal murray turned into prime kobe bryant.. and of course like how kyria got hurt in the finals in 2015 Anthony davis gets hurt and was basically not a factor for the whole last quarter. feel bad for bron bron
Paul trolling Keyshawn 😂😂😂😂
Lebaby just walks out without shaking their hands or any sportsmanlike gesture.   It's clearly not "just a game" for him.  What a hypocrite.
Darvin Ham is trash. He breeds to go. 12-2 run then go goes small ball and calls the timeout after 14-2 run
👍🏻
Paul is the only one that calls lecry out on his bs. They love blaming everybody expect for the person that has the ball in his hand the most but always clowning AD. Bron stays flopping and acting injured EVERY GAME. Key is a LECRY FAN BOY 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
does LeHairline still think he's the GOAT? haha
They are the champs but the not making it to the finals this year
Paul Pierce saving this show.  Love it.  Keyshawn out to lunch with this.
Jokić 7 turnovers,he was exausted from not me ssing FT....0-0
more talented and they squeaked by 😆
Darvin ham needs to go How do you just let Murray dribble out the clock and get into a shot You double team him set a trap something man but 2 game winners Blown leads He sucks
Lakers had no answer for Murray the entire series
Free throws cost them the games.
Jokic is always consistent but we have to respect MPJ....Family Issues may have been affecting him Mentally but not at this Series he has been the X Factor
Paul Pierce brought me back!
Keyshawn: "We close." 🤣🤣
Thank God for Paul Pierce for speaking with balance and reason.
Wolves different animal
Lakers more embarrassing with the in season tournament then pat Beverly celebrating the playin win😂😂
Love Paul segments... give keysan off for NBA segments.
Lakers couldnt hit free throws at the end
Paul pierce is saving this show !!
THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE WAYNE INTRO IN
The reason the Lakers lost is because of Darvin Ham’s inability to make adjustments to keep the lead when Denver’s coach made their adjustment. Why isn’t any of these guys talking about that?
Let's be real. You don't talk nuggets  BC  THE NBA MVP IS A WHITE MAN .. TO MANY BLACK JEALOUS PLAYERS  RACIST PLSYERS  N MEDIA
AD excused himself, so LeBron wouldn't use him as a scapegoat.
Keyshawn lol you hear yourself bro!!!! Its kames he os a toxic player joke wake up....gonna call him out on charging that woman then bragging about it ...cant the goat carry his team he threw under the bus at the post game ..lol good luck getting anyone next year james lol...never be jordan never be kobe bird Malone etc shaq stop jocking james gets baild out all the time!!!!! Joke!!!! Le goast fouls
THE WHOLE ROSTER WON THAT GAME MURRAY WIT THE WINNER GORDON GET THEM CLUTCH REBOUNDS MPJ JUST A PROBLEM JOKER BEING JOKER THERE JUST A BEAST OF A TEAM
Paul knows his basketball clearly. But man he’s not objective when it comes to the Lakers and Lebron!! He’s just pointing to the games the Nuggets won this series with zero context at all. He’s acting like Cam Reddish and Jared Vanderbilt wouldn’t have made a difference defensively. All 4 Nugget wins were close. Even closer than the “close sweep” in the conference finals last year. If the Lakers role players were healthy, this series goes 7 games.
Paul wasn’t hurt he had to boo-boo 😂
We ain’t get sweep so ion care what nobody said
The wheelchair game Paul Pierce hit himself😂 sorry Paul but you said it online already that's just what had happened😅
Lakers win lebron the goat. Lakers lose everyone else sucks coaching is terrible etc😂
Paul pierce is so entertaining
Ham be gone 😂
Way to go Nuggets
For the majority of the season, Lakers were the 10th seed, and Keyshawn thinks we are close 😅😅😅
Paul saving skip show🤔
Paul Pierce has been a welcome addition alongside Skip and Key.
Two 2-point games, thats how close it actually was… But great closers from Denver though…
Stop the di..ck riding  Let's talk about  27 freethrows to 9.   Nba is rigged. Lababy  THREATIN   a female nuggets fan? Why is he not charged..
Skip said DAT boy fell like he got SHOT!!😭🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂
“If I beat you 12 out of 13 times…..you my son” 🤣🤣🤣
Gonna cover james lunges at female fan calling him a cry baby like he is!!!!! Ya they cut it put of tnt feed but i saw it all on overtime so dont have to hear le medi keep proping up james!!!! O ya he threw his team under the bus during post game!!!! Wat a fraud flopper traveling joke layup uncontested queen wats up skip!!!??? James os a fraud lakers get enough free throws???? Joke 27-9 Lakers..lol look at reg season stats ..lol refs leading scorer on team
Paul wasn’t hurt, he had the bubble guts, that’s on record 😂
AD is too fragile. It's a physical game and he appears to be made of glass.
When bro pointed at paul when skip talks bout paul leaving the game in a wheelchair 10:28 😂😂😂😂
Hey guys. Now that the LA Lakers are out of the playoffs, I wonder how will the viewership for the remainder of the playoffs. Any predictions guys?
Little Wayne..lol wat a joke!!!! This clown!!!! Fox .lol joke le frad media gonna cover james lunges at female fan then brags about it...gonna cover it skip!!!!???
James played 44 minutes more than any Laker. He wasn't tired! 🤣
If AD hadnt got injured, it would be on still
Is there a full version of Lil waynee undisputed song?
Lost cause Anthony Davis got injured 🤦
Yall lost because ya basketball savant Lebron James basketball IQ went south lobbying for a challenge that by the way you won but left you out of time outs and didn't score with the possession Smh
IDC wat LeBron scored he lost and champions don't lose when it's crunch time
AD is so soft
He faked an injury foh
Skip is sick to his stomach lol now that they are gone he had to talk bout the others but I’m Sure before the playoffs are over he will find a way lol. He gone cry in the car
Paul pierce makes this show even worse
Keyshawn, the fact that you cheered Jamal’s injury yesterday is disgusting and shameful. How do you cheer for an injury?!  Unbelievable and tactless. Glad Jamal played and sent the Lakers home.
Skip got the greatest intro ever lol
Ain't no one but Paul mentioning that dunk and key slid right by it but he talking bout the 3's.
Denver definitely I can say not more talented than Los Angeles. The facts still remains woke James cannot come through in the clutch. The difference is woke James shots bricks while Murray  shots nothing but net
Keyshawn coming in with the god awful take "We may have lost 12 of 13, but the Lakers are close!!! Lakers gonna be the first team to ever come back from a 4-1 deficit!! We got the Nuggets right where we want them!!"
I so enjoy an analysis where 90% of the discussion is about the team which lost. Journalism at its finest.
"it's your size too!"  ouch
Skip brought up that wheelchair game and Keyshawn couldn't hold it in 😂😂
Finger tips on ball is crazy. Damn skip, big pause
Paul Pierce is just hilarious man !!
Why can we see the highlights you are talking about...we used to see them
Los Angeles whingers and Le Moan James lost again.
Bron a major reason Pierce got 1 ring 😂😂😂😂 so I understand
Minnesota 4 Denver 0 👀
Jamal "KOBE" murray didnt sit out a game like lebronda would have if he got poked by a fingernail on his arms  lebron a 🐱.
Paul pierce definitely saved this show.. to get it even better.. whenever they are talking about basketball, they should bring another person with bball knowledge.. Keshawn is not it
😂😂😂😂😂Keyshawn " They brushed up against him"😂😂😂😂
It’s all about matchups.
Take that L!  K Johnson u deserve that Kkkkkarma hah!!!
No if your a Lebron fan
the JOKER & JAMAL "KOBE" MURRAY TOOK THAT SHI7 FROM lebronda and adam silver.  thats why they spanked lebronda.
Lakers Eliminated is not the coaches LBJ want to win other players don’t want to win
24:00😂
I love the Lil Wayne intro.
Joker no free thro attempts what a joke
Lebron needs two all stars to win in normal season simple as that n why he’s not close to Jordan and never will be
Why not just foul let Denver shoot  so the Lakers can have time left … tie it up go to OT and battle it out…
Glad to see this useless bum Keyshawn get owned by Pierce
So in season tournament doesn't mean much
We love it. Anytime any team Eliminates The Lakers. Dats a good Thing. And a good Day! Thank you Nuggets!¡!!❤
They got MPJ, we got Jaden McDaniels.  Edited: AD the softest person in the NBA
I wonder if skip would still take embiid over jokic lol
Lakers should have fouled Murray as soon as he got in 2-point range, because the best-case scenario of not fouling is he misses and you have to play overtime in Denver at altitude against a better/healthier team. If you foul, even if Murray makes both free throws, you've still got time on the clock to get a decent shot off, potentially a game winner.
Thank you Paul Pierce for shutting down this Vando conversation... he ain't All-Defense, and Lakers got swept when Vando actually played last year.
How can anyone watch these games...walk down stand outside the three....the entire team! Then pass the ball to LeBron and wait...no going after rebounds....just waiting....Lakers players are tired of it....they don't get to play....no one even sweats!  Half the time labron is on the ground or crying while the other team goes down and scores ...last night there was no sense of urgency at all!
You know who Jamal Murray is if you sit and think about it. He is the Julian Edelman of the NBA.
Like this comment for no reason 😬
"12 out of 13 isn't close" lol
The Truth speaks the truth. A rising star in the broadcast game. Elevates this show.
Gettin beat 12 times out of 13 games is close😂
Isn't it interesting whenever they are talking about the Lakers taking a game winning shot at the end, its usually not about LeBron taking it?
With the Lakers out, expect fewer views on your channels. We're all about the Lakers here. Let's go Lakeshow!
The Lakers hung in the games because of the favorable calls from the refs sending them to the line.
Paul is the only person talking any sense about basketball. Cam reddish and jarred vandabilt wouldn’t have played even if they were healthy let’s not make these excuses
didn't Davis the other game go scoreless in the 4th and he wasn't hurt at all!
I love keyshawn as a jets fan.. But as a nuggets fan he's in denial
Boy, this is a bad show. To much nonsense talk
Man this show is not the same Skip is not the same anymore he is tame
Keyshawn says a whole lot of nothing!! Replace him with Rachel until football season😅
Skip at the end 😂😂
they knew keyshawn couldn’t talk basketball so they had to add my boy P to the show lol no cap.
Coach Ham coaches with lots of heart, grit, and instincts but he's clearly out-coached by a coach like Malone when it comes to tactics, time clock management, rotation management, in-game adjustments, etc. etc.   Ham has a better future in the NBA with a younger squad and developing franchise...  As for his replacement? I can only wish LA could somehow pull off a deal with Houston for Ime 🤘doka. 😂
Keyshawn is a poor man's Shannon. Might as well bring on Scalabrini who is closer to Lebron than he is.
Keshawn Johnson and Skip Bayless always got an excuse for LeBron every year ain’t no excuse.U win is a win and a loss is a loss.
Key: we close... P: 12 outta 13 ain't close...12 outta 13 u my son!
For me the biggest problem was the 9 free throws they missed.
When keyshawn said just give me the damn ball he wasn't talking about the basketball. Because it's obvious he don't know about basketball. 🤔
Bye Bye Ham Lakers need some beef
At least we have a title to be proud of this season
Facts
Forget the teams, I truly hope the "GOAT" debate is finally over, although it should have been done a long time ago.
Does anybody see the similarities between the Eagles last season and the Nuggets this playoff run? They win but everyone keeps saying “they haven’t played their best yet”. 🍎 to 🍊?
Idk Paul. Vando and reddish could’ve definitely changed the series by actually defending mpj
Wayn intro was unnecessary ⛽️
It’s funny cause Lebron is Pierces daddy
I'm here for Paul Pierce..Key,Rich,and skip was trash
The truth!!!!  Paul Pierce
Paul may not be a crazy as I think he is. A.D. is a big faker, he just wanted some rest. Thought he could slow Denver down. Jamal did what I hoped, come out semi hurt and help his team win. Go Nuggets!!!
Not gonna lie, I’ve missed Paul on TV
Paul P. Is a fool!! Lol
The show got a lot better
The revs kept the games close. Lakers got this series 109 and Denever 63 free-throws. And still the Lakers can't win. Game 5 it was  27 for LA and 9 for Denver. It's a shame.  I'm glad the Lakers are eliminated. 😊
The nba tried to give the Lakers basically a 12 to 15 point free throw advantage and it still wasn't enough. They hate Jokic and the fact Murray isn't even an all star is shameful. Keep rollin Nuggets. The peoples champs!
And Gil said point blank that the Lakers was gon shock the world? FOH
Anybody notice the random cut to just the microphone at 5:35? 👀🤔
Pierce starting to sound like doc
Coaching matters. Gg to Denver. Hopefully we get a new coach next year
key doing tricks on it to explain why AD wasn't hurt and defended him 100000% after being happy that jamal was hurt yesterday. smh this is why everyone hates the lakers and their fans
The only reason lakers were "close" is because jamal struggled shooting. If he averaged 30 efficiently it's not even a series and would of been another sweep
Being Rachel for NBA analysis. Key can sit that segment out
Lakers put up a better fight this year than last year, but still not enough, especially from the bench.
Paul just said "they need to outplay them clearly for 44 minutes"... 😂
Paul Pierce should get a long contract,he is honest and tell it like it is, he is no fan boy of anyone. That's a true non bias spokesman.
That’s why they call P the Truth yo, coz he gon give it to you straight up
You’re my son!!
I don’t really understand Keyshawn’s arguments most of the time. He should accept too that Denver is Lakers daddy for now 😂😂😂
Paul Pierce haha
We Didint get swept though 😎
Murray was the biggest reason wtf is he talking about
Like he …just … got…shot…LOL
Lakers didn't get swept this time... a bonus.
I disagree I don’t see the Nuggets in the finals this season they lost too many key role players in the off season all difference makers in the playoff through to the finals
That's Karma for Keyshawn saying it was "good" Jamal was hurt.
Paul pierce is the truth.
I feel your pain Keyshawn. Game 2 and 5 were tough losses. Jamal Murray is treating the Lakers like Kobe did the Nuggets back then.
Still if you don't get ad to  4 n get 7 2 Guy.?
So I guess Richard Sherman is gone for good
Keyshawn enough with the excuses end of the day the lakers got there butts kicked and they lost
Keyshawn is a clown. Imagine if someone had celebrated a Bron injury. The whole media would have rioted.. hypocrites!
Still then again AR misses 2 shots in last 90 seconds
God Paul pierce is the worst.
Still why was A D asking for the ball
When Bron was taking his FTs to tie the game LA subbed in Prince for DLO to play D.  They should've subbed in Vando for Reaves there to play D on Murray.  Vando was available to play yet didn't see any minutes.
Kind of glad they got eliminated cause I couldn’t stand hearing all you hating Jordashians crying how the NBA is rigged or the refs helped them win. Keep comparing 39 year old LeBron to prime Jordan 😂
Still no shame in LeBron James game yes he tied because two shot by Austin that the Fact
Key makes an absolute a$$ out of himself anytime there’s lakers/Bron involved.
Still AD is needy at time's but a warrior and if he gets eye pokes n hit to balls n knees to the thigh
AD is so fragile for a big man. I can’t figure out how he got injured. It didn’t look like a punch
Still why do LeBron James U C train 🚂 James U Do it n ur Hall of Famer 😊
Why is Skip acting like he wanted the Lakers to win?
The guy in white shirt and tie is so annoying... he is arguing like a 7 year old kid. Pierce is a great addition to the show.
If they didn’t challenge then that put Jokic at the line for 2 fts. Game wouldn’t have been tied. Nuggets would’ve been up before the Murray shot and the lakers gotta foul. Either way that’s not why you lost. Get over it. Stop making excuses!
😂😂😂😂 she salty af. Just because ur the DA doesnt mean u get special priveleges, they get away with this stuff quite often and do so knowing could possibly catch the defense off guard. This Judge is holding her accountable and im here for it. No excuse for it if u were already told prior to flag things in advance.
All of these excuses!! Denver is just better
At least we won the in season tournament 🤣
Still I meeting everyone here.not Skip but remember in The future fox can bring in guests n the team Here in Good standing n Sherman back this real 2 me ..
I don’t understand all these comments promoting Pierce. It’s obvious he didn’t even watch the game 😭😭 also I understand the importance of going over the screen against shooters but Austin reeves was trailing every play because he refused to go under. Even near half court he was fighting to go over the screen for no reason. That’s what caused them to lose the game. Terrible coaching and no adjustments from the lakers
I don't believe that Murray was injured. He pulled a Paul Peirce.
I vote for Keyshawn to get cut from the show. Never liked his vibe for this show..
The Lakers weren’t winning. Stop already.
I watched LeBron give up 29 & 15 to Aaron Gordon on all dunks & putbacks with my own two eyes Darvin Ham ain’t force him to play like an idiot, or force DLO to shoot 0-8 or force Rui to play terrible the entire series, he didn’t force the lakers bench to not show up, AD disappeared in the fourth quarter of every game but that’s Hams fault he should run on the floor and put the ball in AD’s hands himself right? The players just can’t be ignoring his play calls right? Cause LeBron just would never try to sabotage a coach right 🙄  This will be his fourth coach in 7 seasons btw 🫠
Still again thankfully this team of undisputed top professional s thank u all love from my Time ❤❤❤❤😊
Man Paul when was the last time with weak support cast you win play off series
Paul Pierce and Michael Irvin are the best candidates to replace Shannon Sharpe
Jokic is too good, he wins games with no calls. Nobody is stoping that man.
Thank god we don’t have to listen to Keyshawn talking about garbage… Paul Pierce thank you.
Keyshawn seems nice, but he’s gotta go, Paul Pierce may be the perfect fit though!
Still did any one Micheal Jordan at winner's circle ⭕ KOOL 😜
This show suld change name to  .. IF.. lots of if here :)
Still let's debate Interesting Boston Celtics vs Denver nuggets let's go there Mike wilbon Kool Guy aaaasaahhhhhhh asking Tony kornhiser to debate Interesting topic
Thank God for Paul! I have not watched this since Shannon left! Key is a 🤡 making excuses for the Fakers 😂
Why are they saying "We" when talking about the Lakers. Skip the only one spitting fire & facts.
Still Paul remember Boston Celtics vs Denver nuggets?
And Lebron is the GOAT. LOL !
i didn't know Keyshawn "We" Johnson was playing for the Lakers...
Where would skip be without a black man on his tv shows carrying ratings?
Still I am told A dovan Mitchell sighting? Or who?
No mention of how LeBron walked off, no hand shake?
Good Ole Salty Paul is a good commentator, dude just love seeing LeBron fail
I'm trying to root for Keyshawn but c'mon man!  You don't have to be a contrarian for every single point a person makes.
Still do u believe the Miami heat will not sign a players? U will C
Damn key take a year n a half to get to the f n point man 😂 where Irvin at 😂
They lost the game at free throw line. Amd indeed no matter how right you are about a call you save the challenge for the 4th quarter  or when you think it might change the games energy as from the half of the 3rd quarter.
The Truth is a must on this show 💪🏾 Paul P
Still do thinking 🤔 o Golden State not real remember they hv Cash n steff?
Paul still mad at LeBron for bussing his ssa lol
One thing you can’t take away from Skip is that intro song by lil wayne
I love how sincere Paul sounded giving Keyshawn that shirt. “Here you go bro.”Gave it to him as if it was a heart felt gift 🤣
Still if they start next season healthy...... remember Denver nuggets hv free agents and that will change the roster
Paul is carrying this show
Pierce looks like Sally Jessy Ralphael.
Someone needs to tell Keyshawn that they lost 4-1, or 13-1 if you will. They didn't "almost" win.
thats why you need a valuable productive bench to open up 2nd and 3rd quarters.. Or at least to cover for your resting starting line up
Skip is hilarious so what he's trying to say but not actually saying was AD faking
Paul still mad at lebron
If Austin reaves was helping Jamal have some bad shooting games I think he woulda played even worse if vando was on him
Still the Lakers 2. .game two it's changed the series
bottom line,,,lakers LOST......😃😃😃😃😁😁😁😁
If I could thumb up Pierce I would. He talking with toddlers
Still this debate Interesting but the sponsor here to stop with fox sports n u C little Wayne aaaasaahhhhhhh will be there to back the show come on now my friend Chad Johnson will see say let the boys do there Job ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Meh not too bad. Definitely frustrating tho. Need new medical staff and use of physical therapy tape for AD. AR, Rui, Prince need more discipline and practice in their roles/moves (missed lay ups, poor d, etc). And better instruction needed in the 4th (remember all hands on deck and box out, which will actually save energy vs offensive boards). Bron lost focus in 4th unfortunately. Still overall not too bad. Just run it back and work together. Lose dinwiddie tho lol
Close...only counts in "horseshoes and ......"  Lakers need to re-tool because next year will be the same if not worse.
I see these two together ik it’s hella hating goin on😂😂
Key is in CYA mode after yelling yay about Murray being hurt.  Key gotta go.
Yeah lil Wayne did that on the intro! That's the hardest one he's done yet! The metaphors using Skip Bayless was dope AF!
"I got swept then gentleman swept in back to back playoffs. And that made me the greatest of all time" LeBron, probably
Paul is the funniest and he be right all the time
Theyll blame everyone but THIER SELF PROCLAIMED GOAT. Darvin Ham is a better coach than lebron james is a team leader.
Bro why not take ad out if he has only use of one arm lol don't make sense
I don’t understand why you don’t keep your timeout when winning a challenge. If they’re gonna take something from the NFL get it right! Makes zero sense you don’t get that timeout back. I agree you should only get 2 challenges if the 1st one is successful
They call this man THE TRUTH and I see why! Skip is a genius for brining him on this show.
They needed khabi haha to lock.down Murray
You know y'all clowning😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 my side hurt
Teamplay is the reason for Success- nothing more
Dunked on Lebron with a strained calf!😂
I really don’t think Murray was hurt.
You know this show is a joke when they got Paul Pierce in this show now 😂😂😂
Skip is a sports journalist, yet he still somehow thinks that Mike Malone said he was the Lakers daddy. Michael Malone never said that! Vic Lombardi, a News caster in Denver said that.
The reflakers try their best to help the  lakers win this game No free  throws  for the joker in the paint and a  team 27 to 9  is crazy..
That was the least enthusiastic rub in with the tshirt. Pierce needs to learn some showmanship
The refs tried to help the Lakers out and they still lost!😂
Still remember most important business hv a back up plan .if not invest to protect ur platform? Yes
The worst c’rapper of them all. 🤢🤮
Still C the tic TOC band maybe Congress dumps this company if bad make it so
Paul pierce is a great addition. I hope he's permanent too
Sty remember this show undisputed is a platform n even cam.get s elevated remember how Many door open up for you asked Tony kornhiser n Roy Firestone n most of ESPN models for employees they picked for put up front.n believe me ur gotta be able to show up sober on Time everyday not easy
Jokic gets his revenge back to back year for Lebron picking him last in the all star game last year. And the Nuggets get revenge back to back from the 2020 bubble and send the Lakers home two straight years in a row.
Paul must don't know Anthony Edwards love torturing the timberwolves 😂 👎
Lakers lost because it became Broncentric in the 4th
MPJ was the reason the nuggets won.
The Nuggets got to up their game if they're going to beat the Timberwolves. Denver stunk in this series.
Similar to Zion, AD is just more injury prone than his peers
Paul Pierce makes this show watchable.
Only watching because of Paul 🤷‍♂️
Rooting for injuries. Classless
This Kishon, or whatever his name is, reminds me of Billy Sparks from Young Sheldon, both in looks and intellect.
Still remember credit is starting now it's easier if Skip BAYLESS 2 convince himself to leave trust me he n Stefanie BAYLESS 2 convince him to stay home? Yes Skip BAYLESS cando a pod cast n does
The FT was disgusting. 27-9 to the Lakers, the refs did everything against the Nuggets.
The problem is they will still talk about the irrelevant lakers everyday. For months where is lacrybaby going. Whats way over rated Bronny going to do. Nobody that scores 4 pts of the bench in college is talked about or thought about drafting. Especially one with what is a sad medical condition.
The intro is so trash
AD quit at the end of the third.
I think Denver is in trouble next series if they play the way they did against Los Angeles. They had too many turnovers. Minnesota is too big and isn’t just going to fall apart in the 4th like the Lakers. As for undisputed, please keep Paul Pierce on.
Paul Pierce is So Lame !!
Key needs to stick to football. You absolutely cannot wrap ur arm around someone while they are driving to the rim smh🙄
The reason that Jamal Murray and so many of the Nuggets squad are comfortable in big moments is because of Jokic. The fact that he’s so unselfish and runs entire games without bothering to score himself so often gets his team HUGE practice minutes in live games. Murray is a credit to the squad and absolutely is a great number 2 but this squad would not look the same with any other all star along side them. What Jokić has done with this squad is unbelievably special he really has elevated them all.
The Lakers need a goat to close and Jamal Murray showed him how to do it, maybe LeBron learned something.  Nah...
Skip is a cuck
He just mentioned the Paul Pierce boo-boo game 😂😂😂
We close?? To what ?? That's wild
Denver is not more talented than the Lakers lol.  Cap.  Difference is the heart and the will.  This is a game Lebron should have won. 30pt is not enough.  That’s just good for stats.  MJ had to average 41 vs the Suns to win that series. Go look at the out put of his team.  The superstar that’s HIM, will find a way to win these close games. 2 years in a row he has not elevated to what’s necessary to win.  Why is Murray and Joker constantly elevating their game to win?  Those are the issues they should be discussing.  We used to hold superstars accountable before.  Every game was winnable by lakers.  Lebron or AD should have closed this and last years series out. Both are not him.
Three idiots this to you kids out there stay in school!!!!!!
Paul, lose those glasses man. WTF!
TRUTH IS LEBRON SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON MURRAY THAT LAST SHOT JUST LIKE GAME 3
If if if
Do Paul and Key got beef with each other?
“0-0 he did not miss a free throw tonight”🤣🤣 Malone is just savage
I was at the game. When AD got "hurt" the whole crowd was booing him and calling him a baby, etc. I saw it from the second row. It did not look like an injury-causing hit whatsoever. More like a flop. Even when Lebron made his two FT and tied the game, there was a feeling that the Lakers still weren't winning. But they did try. Jamal hit one of the nastiest pull-up jumper/fadeaways I've ever seen and that was the final nail in the coffin.
ESPn will still be talking about the Lakers rest of the playoffs 💀
Im sorry, but Denver isnt getting past Minnesota. MPJ and Jamal Murray will both be shut down by Anthony Edwards, mcDaniel and Conley
Lebron walked out again. Unsportsman like. Childish. Narcissist.
Bro Jamal didn't have no strained cav... he just said that to take some attention off him and then bammm he did what he did last night
Nuggets win ❌ Lakers lose ✅ That’s ESPN’s mentality for big market teams.
Paul > Keyshawn
I just wanted to see the Lakers contain and put better "clamps" with MPJ he outscored our bench by himself. Our coaching was garbage and our bench was garbage. Joker and Murray are going to do their thing like AD and Lebron did, but our perimeter defense has been trash all season.
They put Jokić at the post while Aaron Gordon was in the dunker’s spot, MPJ in the corner 3, Jamal at the top, KCP in the corner 3 and shoutout to Kwame Brown
Keyshawn should be fined for saying he was glad Murray was hurt. This is the Lejoke effect. Bad horrible disgusting people. Pathetic.
Damn it AD! Of all the times u coulda been injured. This one was ours for the taking.
Its funny listening to them talk about how bad AD is bumping into a guy while watching the NHL playoffs. Avs series Devon Toews gets smashed in the face bleeding all over the ice and plays the next game.
Joker not going to the line 1 time is insane. Dude was getting mauled by the Lakers all night. Refs did everything for Lakers
Keyshawn interrupts too much!
Keshawn needs to go. Unintelligent takes and he always interrupts when they’re speaking. He is also annoying
That weezy laugh from Pierce was hilarious! Lol!
HAHA, Joker james now has the most losses in the playoffs in NBA history. He can where 23 but he will never be a goat. he is good but there are so many way better then now and later
AD new Lastname is his Jersey will be FRAGILE 😆 😆
I honestly think AD did what he could. He didnt look right after that injury. Some players just have a different pain tolerance than others.
Nothing better than watching Murray fry the Lakers after Keyshawn was celebrating his potential injury yesterday
Terrible show! Denver wins but its all about LeBron. No one worse than Pierce and keshawn, especially Skippy.
It’s crazy because Aaron Gordon made two key rebounds in this series that helped the Nuggets win game 2 (MPJ 3 to tie) and game 5 (Jamal Murray to take the lead)
AD got "touched" and couldn't recover. What a joke.
KJ is completely unwatchable. He and Chris Haynes should do a show together.
To piggy back on what key said about that last play for nuggets. I rather make Murray drive and try to dunk 😂 why would I allow him to pull up mid range when he been killing us with that same shot for 16 qtrs
The difference in this series was coaching.
Dam wayne kills that intro😂😂😂 🐐🐐🐐
The opening song goes so hard
Key is dummmm. Like HOW did he get into USC?
I've never seen such disrespect towards Jokic on whole web like I so on this show, respect for Paul Pierce but the other two gentlemen can not even hide how disrespectful they are. I'll give you some statistics to consider, just for current playoff 5 games: Jokic averaging 28.2 Points/Game, 16.2 Rebound/Game, 9.8 Assists/Game, 59% FG, 33%FT and you are talking only Murray, shame on you.
LeLoser Johnson Karma is a Bitachhhh!!! Loser
Remember MPJ is like a taller DBook - he was meant to be a #1 option. As long as he's converting Denver can't lose!
Why is Keyshawn on this show?  He is an analyst using words "We" instead of Lakers. Like he is playing for Lakers.   We all know the media dickrides the Lakers, but this is way too ridiculous. Completely unprofessional.
Lakers surprised me honestly. They were right there every game. Pierce is right they would have beaten any other team in the playoffs
lol they still making excuses for this team. AD gets injured every playoff run, if it wasn’t for the pandemic lakers wouldn’t have won in 2020… what about the refs just gifting teams that are down in the series freethrows in the hope of extending it.
Paul pierce needs to be quiet bc Lebron is playing at a high level and he's sitting there in a suit talking smack. Come one now. look in the mirror bro.
Paul had me laughing on two responses 😅😂 I forgot where but just came to comment I wish there live chat for the show on YouTube ha
Ok ill say it.  I think Anthony Davis is a double agent.  He does this every year. Its like he's saying Lebron, win it by yourself.   Your going to win the MVP regardless of what I do.  So win without me.  He disappeared every game in the 4th quarter.   For whatever reason.  I think its obvious.   He is there to prevent Lebron from winning 6 rings. 😂
The reason is Jokic
AD dud nothing in the second half
Yo that step back by Murray made me consider selling my Ohio property. Cold.....
If the Lakers have a competent coach this series is still going. Ham was outclassed with horrible rotations, not knowing when to call a timeout, and burning timeout's. WHAT DOES HE DO??
The players that are surrounded by lebron and a.d are just to inconsistent
Paul pierce was a great addition to the show. keyshawn not so much.
why is Paul Pierce even on TV?
I know Jamal and Jokic will get their credit but shoutout MPJ, Aaron Gordon, KCP(toughen it out all game), Reggie Jackson for keeping it close until the 4th quarter and letting the two star players take it over.
Not the biggest? Wtf. He hit TWO game winners. Foh. He IS the reason the lakers are home rn
Keyshawn crying cuz Murray wasn’t hobbled. That game winner tastes so much sweeter.
Denver 5th option is better than the lakers 3rd option show you how much better they are than the lakers
Get keyshawn off the show bro smh
Pierce is hating & capping! LA had a chance every game to win & Vando+Cam Reddish would've helped a lot. Their size, defense, rebounding & hustling! LA wins this series easily & DHamm needs to go. He doesn't know how to take the ball out of JM hands on the 4th quarter. Make somebody else beat us Hamm dangggg smhhh!
This show is trash. Keyshawn is terrible. He looks terrible. Paul Piece is an idiot.
Dude Keyshawn is awful he needs to go. I’ve never been a Paul Pierce fan but his addition to the show is solid imo
This is PP show
The refs checks better still clear because they tried their best 😂😂..27 free throws to 9 is insane!
Keyshawn steps all over pauls take,s his loud voice drown,s out paul and skip
I do not think Murray was hurt or injured to begin with
Brushed up against him 😂😂😂 AD is glass man smh lol
That intro wayne
The nuggets own the last four minutes
Keshawn looks like he was a petulant kid.
Key on bball almost unwatchable
It’s the Lakers league and the Nuggets are just in it. But it’s not the globetrotters they don’t always win. The sports media are forever to cover the Nuggets because they keep winning
I only watch this broadcast to enjoy Paul Pierce make Keyshawn Johnson look like a damn fool when he tries to talk basketball.
Weezy
Skip is a career LeBron hater. Then enters Paul Pierce, a former Celtic.  Keeshawn is outnumbered 4 to 1.
Lebron should’ve been jumping at Murray and the nuggets instead of that lady
Paul: Let me give you this Celtic green who’s your daddy shirt  Paul: I thought we were talking about the Lakers 😂😂
Why is it green? 😂😂 pierce wildin.
Man  A D is soft as SpongeBob eating cotton candy on a bed full of pillows,go back and look at the play again, Absolutely nothing happened
LeBalco is the first player in NBA history to win an In-Season Tournament MVP and get eliminated in the first round ala gentleman's sweep.
Lets see Jamal at 39.. I rest my case.
the Jamal Murray disrespect is real he's stepped up and proved himself already, he played through an injury the last couple games (i don't know how bad it was) but he still did
That sweep right there def made me the GLOAT. Lebalco Hormone Blames greatest loser of all time 2024. Btw who we blaming the coach or the team leader both being lebron lol.
Paul pierce wheelchair game lol. I thought homie career was over the way he was acting.
First take is like a 4 course breakfast, compared  to undisputed  being dry toast and a glass of water, no eye candy (molly) just very  dry antithetical
Last night lakers 106 vs 108 Denver Nugget Lebron James Jalen Hurray Nikola jokic ‼️👀👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Keyshawn is a JAF...........Just Another Fanatic .....all season totally clueless to the actual on the court. Lakers are Barbecue 🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗😀😀😀😀😀😀
IM PROUD OF MY BOYS WE GOT CHEATED!!! 3Z
Pierce cracking on Key never gets old😂
thank God, Paul is here to talk sensitive two stubborn Mule’s
Jokic = AD + LeBron, Murray =all the other 3 starters in lakers squad.
Paul Pierce really jealous of Lebron
Paul Pierce did it his way
keyshaw.. .. you 1 of those fans...instead of beating the team fair and square, u rather wish injury on the other team players to get an edge. Foolishness!!!    I want all yr best players playing at yr peak..when i beat you. then i clown you wit no excuses.!!!   Btw... ZERO free throws for Jokic. How?????????
Key said that “are you done?” in such a humbled, defeated manner 😂😂
Enough of the laker love affair !!! Lmao
P Pierce makes me drowsy ...
They not beating Timberwolves
Keyshawn gon cry in the car 😂
"Skip if i beat you 12 out of 13 times,  YOU'RE MY SON !!  "  -  Paul MF Pierce !!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pierce gave Keyshawn a who's your daddy t shirt and laughed in his face live on air 😂😂😂 super petty😂😂
Let’s not forget Pierce popped himself and ask for a wheelchair.
1-2-3 CANCUN🍆
Even the theme tune was better when Shannon was there!
Even the theme tune was better when Shannon was there!
I remember getting these 'Stinger' injuries and you literally just shook your arm nonstop until blood rushed to the area to warm it up and it got better.   It's called 'walk it off!' 😂
Even the theme tune was better when Shannon was there!
Nuggets Twolves is going to be a dog fight! T wolves have the bigs and length to challenge Joker, Murray, and MPJ. Will look to see if Twolves youth comes to fruition for a couple games down the stretch. Otherwise, Minnesota looks scary!
Lakers fire people and then realize it was a mistake and try to get them back ! Front office is ridiculous
This show is garbage
Murray reminds me of curry
Here’s where I’ll commend Lebron, when AD got hurt Bron put his scoring hat on and made it his point to drive the basketball and his play kept them in that game, cause from that point on AD took 2 shots.
Ya he is
Street clothes didn't disappoint in "getting hurt" in a big game 😂 love seeing keyshawn miserable about the Fakers
Paul wasn’t hurt he pooped 😂😂
Lakers will always be bad#$# way after Lebron is gone,  just too popular.
Please get Keyshawn off the show.. He is absolutely terrible. Paul Pearce is fine but Keyshawn has no thoughtful analysis…
Paul chatting with the vando talk 😭😭 bro is a good defender
Based on Keyshawn's logic, when AD got injured, I was excited for the opportunity for the Nuggets to get edge to win that game.
Keep paul p on the show!
Bruh is Skip defending Bron??😂
Paul got dunked on plenty of times- I know he not laughing
Paul Pierce is the only reason I watch undisputed. Keyshawn and Skip have no idea what they are talking about most times.
Paul ur HILARIOUS 🤣🤣
Nuggets gonna repeat❗see y'all in June after the Finals
Paul pierce kicks some sense into skip !
Keyshawn would be a great public defender LOL
All I care about...is that my Nuggets 🏆 won
Ham was totally out coached.
“I got a green one for you ….😶😶😶🙂….. it’s your size too👀👀👀”  Said in the most calm and gentle manner 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
why do we dont see the play?
Paul pierce is my idol when he was playing the other man do not know how to what it feels like inside the court 😂😂😂😂😂
Keyshawn is number 1 LBJ bandwagon he talk very good only what team and who he like every things else opposite u can’t be show host like that😡
Hats off to the Denver Nuggets. But if DAVIS didn't get hurt for a long period of time. Most likely, the LAKERS would have WON that game.
Paul ignorant - he is even getting on skips nerves
Skip struggling show is now gonna get worse cuz the only fans he has for lebrick aka phony goat fanboys  cuz he talks about him 24/7 and i will bet anyone that he still has topics on lebron just to keep his 50,000 viewers left 😂😂
Key - "we close..." PP - "...12 out of 13 ain't close.."
I like Keyshawn now… he is doing great work! This show is taking over again! \m/
And now labum lost they now even talking about it how funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂3 1 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂loser😂😂😂😂😂but they won't highlight that part of his longevity 😂😂😂😂😂😂loser
Are these guys for real? Do they really think their audience are a bunch of idiots? Jarred Vanderbilt stopping Jamal Murray?!? Cam Reddish would have helped in these series?! On any other team in the playoffs these dudes would just be bench warmers. This is like hearing a Nuggets fan say that with Vlatko Cancar they would sweep the Lakers again. 🤣😂 Just take that L and move on. Better team won, period!
Unsubscribed.  Aint the same without Shannon
Paul Pierce like that dunk. Bron came in the league and ended their entire franchise 😂😂
Keyshawn is funny cause all LeBron fans do is praise him for getting there and losing...lol
Lakers would be a better team without Lebron
The weezy intro is an easy highlight of the show
Skip said AD went down like a soccer player😂
Im just glad yall dont have to talk about the lakers anymore
Key displays the most disinterested, disrespectful body language I have ever seen in sports media. He needs to go.
Wayne intro is 🔥
Blame coach  again  Lakers lose games 5 ntg to do coach  Lakers  lose back to back  2 offensive rebounds in the clutch  one by joker put back 103 then Gordon  grabs  one offensive rebounds  i think jamal outside 3 points clutch 106
ANTHONY “BRITTLE🤕🤒” DAVIS didn’t want “THAT SMOKE 💨 💨” !!!   Come get those “Ls Ls Ls Ls” LAKERS 😏🫣😎!!!
Keyshawn and Skip gotta learn to shut up sometimes, because Paul knows more about basketball then the both of them put together.  (The Truth 34)
Dame lillard messed up his Achilles and his response is "whatever"??
Skip has no chill, “AD goes down like he got shot” 💀🤣
If the Lakers had won it would have been all about LeBron 😂😂😂😂😂 that's why AD got hurt he know he the man and yall keep calling him Robin 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 well if AD had kept playing and won the game allllll the flowers would had went to LeBron
5:34 What’s with the random shot of the microphone ?😂👀🎤🎙️
BACK TO BACK
Skip bayless, you are growing on me. Keep being genuine and logical and it'll be alright!
That suit fire 🔥 Paul pierce got on
Paul Pierce's expert analysis, then you have these 2 clowns. Cringe
THE TRUTH brings the truth to Undisputed!
paul pierce said right before the all star game break that all the old stars are done getting far in the playoffs it’s a new league,that it’s happened to all eras it’s not disrespectful but THE TRUTH
Hard luck Lakers!!!!
The other man is crying😂
Lakers are too SOFT !!!
To many offensive rebounds lakers allowed and missed free throws cost Lakers the game period
5:05 “Getting there and not winning” is literally the epitome of LEBRON JAMES Keyshawn😂😂🫣🤷🏾👨🏾‍💻🤔Losing finals record
Paul only loves it cause LeBron is his daddy
“LEGONE JAMES” on his way to CANCUN 🏝️☀️ 🎣 !!! 😏😫😩🥺😢😭👀🔥💯😎
Hahaha i love you Paul Pierce
in this 20+ minute segment, Clownshawn Johnson came up with more excuses for LeBald & the Echo Lake Swimmers' massive L than LeBald has had hairplug operations since he was a rookie at 18 years old.
If you can overcome Lebron’s secret free throw super power advantage… you got talent.
This show is so so boring I am here cause of Paul
Nobody represents "getting there and not winning" better than Lebron.
LET ME TELL U.IF LEBRON had gone an ENTIRE GAME WITH ZERO FREE THROWS  then all u laker fans would go BOLISTIC!!! YET THE MVP AT HOME GETS ZERO FREE THROWS LAST NIGHT. UTTER BULLSH@T!! . PERIOD. SO TAKE THAT L OUT OUR DOOR AND DON'T COME BACK
Paul Pierce Saved Undisputed
In theee EEEeeeeennnd
This shyt sicking first it's the coach now it's AD, never LeBron not those free throws he missed if he made his "free-throw they win the game. The Lakers shot about 20 more free throws than the Mavs
Paul Pierce is the piece that was missing
Shoulda signed demarcus cousins
Losing 12 out of 13 aint close xD
Calling all Lebron haters. Can one of y’all please explain how any of this is Lebron’s fault for losing  if u knew they were going to lose anyway? What was he supposed to do exactly, average 50 ppg??? If u actually look at the stats for the series the only ppl who actually upped their level of play was Lebron, AD, and Austin Reaves. Literally everyone else on the roster averaged less points in this series than they did the whole regular season. Yet somehow yall still put the blame on Bron so please explain…
Wow, the Lakers have 27 free throws  and Nuggets just 9 free throws is crazy. The Fakers don't  win!! But I'm glad they bounced back to Cancun Fakers 😂😂  Congrats to the Nuggets though 🎉
Paul P was a great player and is even greater person.
Keyshawn like every other Lebron Stan setting up excuses already lol
The Lakers hate that Paul brings to this show saved this show, making Key miserable. 😂
Thank god!
Lil Wayne popped off
Laker NATION..WE WILL BE BACK...
Paul you’re an absolute awesome addition to show.
Lakers played tough, would have beat anyone else!! Murray is a hall of famer right now!!!
Key was SO SALTY bout that shirt LOL and BTW P SAVED THIS SHOW. Skip owes P his life hahaha
It baffles me that lakers fan took so much pride of being the 9th seed for 2 years 😂😂, look at them now
That shirt handover was satisfying 😂😂😂😂
Lakers are terrible. Lavar ball was right. They will NEVER win without Lonzo. BBB for life! Trade AD for Gelo and Melo ASAP 💯
No doubt DAVIS TRIED....100%
PAUL PIERCE🏀🏆🙌🏽💪🏽🔥 > KEYSHAWN🏈🥴🤢🤮!!!
"AD goes down like he got shot"🤣😅🤣😂🤣😂
Its just Basketball
Keyshawn takes forever to say nothin lol
And Keyshawn, why was AD nowhere to be seen in at least 3 games second half? Was he injured or was his buddy the "i always make the best play" point guard not playing him while orchestrating lakers' offense?
All i gotta say is that Lakers need better Defense guarding Murray or just bump up their Defense in general
Pierce Lebron is your daddy😅🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂
The media is in COMPLETE DEVASTATION AND AGONY right now!!
Jokic 0 - 0 from the foul line...this is the craziest stat.  Nuggets versus the refs...can't believe the Nuggets won.
Dat why we watch "It is what it is" Listen at Paul
This show just finds every excuse to why they lost , man the nuggets are dealing with injuries also
I think it’s funny how the narrative for the Lakers every year is no championship=failure. As a Timberwolves fan we’re celebrating winning a series lol.
The wheelchair💩
Just like pierce is Lebrons Son💪🏽😎
Paul pierce is weak and acts like a wounded woman
Paul pierce is salty cause lebron is his daddy living in his head rent free
I’m here for the wayne intro, ion like the 2 sarcastic commentahaters 🤣😂🤣😂 JM is on a mission every since he missed denvers 1st playoff run my boy back for vengence
Now y'all can talk about other teams and get off my Lakers 💜💛
Keyshawn is an A- when it comes to discussing football. But basketball -- please go get Antoine Walker. We ain't doing these football clowns like Shannon Sharpe, Ocho, Keyshawn trying to talk basketball. Just because you're Blk doesn't mean you know basketball.
Paul should have bought Keyshawn a "Jamal Murray made a shot" shirt
The Lakers needed that timeout....I realize the challenge worked for them....but being able to advance the ball to half court and possibly changing defensive assignments to get the ball out of Jamal's hands might have changed the game
“Lebron is more rich than joker and was in space jam 2”- bronsexuals coping mechanism
Keyshawn was so mad😂😂
“Who’s your daddy” shirt is going to be sold out.
Lebron will probably announce that next season will be his last the day after the nuggets win the championship lol
No one deserves the L more than Keyshawn after him cheering for Jamal’s injury
"We close" - Delusional KJ
So how many times does this make that the self described GOAT has been eliminated from the playoffs? How many times beaten or swept from the finals? Yeah it's tough to be the "GOAT".  He's among the greats no doubt. But the GOAT? Not so much!
As bad as the refs are, NBA knows teams deserve more than 1 challenge. Should have 2-3 at MINIMUM and should retain it as long as you’re correct.
AD had 1 point in the 2nd half but bron has all the help in the world right? Bron is the goat. If pippen and rodman were with him and available with a HOF coach in phil. Bron is MJ with stats and he would be russell with rings. Darvin is a bum too they needa mention that. He is a terrible head coach just like vogel. If they win any ring its cause of lebron
Michael Porter Jr & Jamal Murray combine for ZERO ALL-STAR SELECTIONS.  Let's make sure that's clear.
Out of shape horse farmer really using Lebum as a human piñata 😂😂😂😂
Any other team?? No, they were not beating the Wolves. Maybe OKC. Probably not even Dallas.
Keahawn Is just bad at tv
Might be the hardest intro song ever 🔥
Wheelchair 😂😂😂
Like last year, The Lakers can keep pace with The Nuggets - except in the final 5 minutes.  The Nuggets are deeper and have a stronger determination to close it out.  It goes to show that The Lakers need to add some strong shooters and even Chris Paul.
Where was Christian Wood?  He was available to play.  Lakers were outcoached again.
Pierce is THE TRUTH for a reason!!!
Ik LeBron like oh now you want to do a dam challenge 😂
Boo hoo Denver fans are so whiny. They expect to get every call. Nuggets are nothing without Jokic
PP is right, Lakers probably would have won against anybody but Denver
I'm glad this finally ends the GOAT talk because when your argument for being the GOAT is longevity -- you lost already.
This show is so awkward lol I only watched to revel in the Lakers Misery.
It wasn't just Murray that made the Lakers lose. The reason why the Lakers lost is because the role players didn't really know how to handle pressure. They were trying to do way too much on offense. They were forcing things. There's a difference between playing hard/strong and playing hero ball. Then on defense, most of the time they were caught ball-watching. You can tell on most of their shots the pressure was affecting them. Then there's the free-throw shooting. The free-throw shooting cost the Lakers the game more than the Murray factor. Then you can add their silly/stupid turnovers.
Skip should manage the show from the background and let the athletes speak on their analysis
Paul pierce so lame with the LeBron hate!
Paul is doing an amazing job, love him on this show.  Also love the look on his face anytime anybody brings up the wheelchair game loll.
KeShawn whines to much. And stop fighting Paul and focus. Also we can see you. Tuck your shirt in.
8:48 Keyshawn 😭😭
Lebron got out played and out boxed by Aaron Gordon all series while missing the game winner in game 2. Lebron deserves a lot of blame
Paul pierce is still mad about what lebron did to him years ago
Hardest sports intro of all time 🔥🔥🔥 Weezy Ate 😤
Lebron will not win another NBA title unless they add another top tier player. Even then, Denver isn’t going away, Thunder/Wolves should be solid for years to come, and Celtics are a better team as well. Can’t see a scenario where he wins another title with Lakers. He’ll need to leave and join a team that’s better where he doesn’t have to play 35 minutes a game at age 40. He likes to switch teams every 5 years so it’s possible.
They’re that desperate copying off Shannon’s nightcap. Undisputed is a forever joke of a show since Shay Shay left
Coach Ham was not the problem.... Bron wasn't engaged on defense on every play. That is the main problem. Play through adversity and stop trying to get foul calls.
Skip is happy asf paul on there. Another lebron hater to join him
Vando would have been a difference maker!
Missed Free Throws, all of the other narratives don't matter. Missing 9 free throws is a recipe for a loss.....
Ad is mr glass😂😂😂😂
1st time in my 30 years i agreed with skip on one thing. And that was the impact on AD. What a soft fluffer man this guy is a joke
Mr pierce….AD could have played better. He disappeared in the second half almost every game.
Is it either me or are these guys not only overrating the Lakers but absolutely dissing Denver.
10:42 Johnson laughs because he knows Pierce pooped on his shorts that's why he needed the wheelchair to leave the arena  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Listen. Game 5 simply came down to the free throws. The play of both teams in that game was basically even.  Lakers missed 9 free throws and most of them in the last 5 minutes of the game. Lakers had 28 total free throws. Nuggets had 9 total free throws. Missing 9 free throws is unacceptable when you are in an elimination game.
Mpj is the x factor
The jealousy of lebron is pathetic at this point
I think the very end of the 3rd quarter killed them. Could have gone in tied. Coming down by 4 did them in again
😅😅😅 PUAL P IS AWESOME
Please bottle LEBRON'S tears and sell them to the highest bidder and donate the money to the Trump campaign  🤣
Skip : “and Ad goes down like he got shot”   LMFAOOOOO
If the Lakers didn't get lucky enough in 2020 to play in a bubble after a 4 month rest period then the Lebron Lakers era has been a catastrophic flop.
Shawn looking for so many excuses lakers could have won. Just give the damn nuggets credit
Keyshawn voice is mad annoying he sounds like he’s always whining…I see why he’s a Lebron fan!!
I hope we trade labron James and try to make a move for clay tompson , kuzman and KD they be a perfect fit for ad and Aston reves
Would be a series different if the Lebron could make WIDE OPEN threes!
Bring Richard Sherman back Pierce is a horrible addition to the show
Skip doing everything to stay relevant 🤣🤣 poor Keyshawn just their for the check 🤣🤣
Paul's face was HILARIOUS when key asked about Celtics going far without winning !!!! 😂😂😂😂  This show is slowly making its way back off the strength of PAUL PIERCE !!!
Paul wasn’t hurt…he needed to take a 💩
It's amazing how people don't pay attention to the words they speak when they call themselves making a profound & valid point . When Paul gave Keyshawn the " Who's Your Daddy " T - shirt , Keyshawn called himself trying to be clever by saying to Paul " Yall ain't out the weeds yet " . To which Paul asked " What do you mean  " ? Keyshawn says " Yall gotta  finish the deal up in Boston  " . Two things wrong here . First off , as Paul correctly stated & clarified the shirt was for the conclusion of this series . Which clearly , Denver did complete the task . Thus making Keyshawn 's point not applicable . Secondly , he's saying Boston is definitely going to be Denver's opponent in the finals . Last I checked  , Boston & the other teams left in the Eastern conference playoffs are still playing . Denver still has to win the west . Having said that , Whichever teams make it to finals , whomever loses shouldn't be satisfied nor be celebrated for simply making it there . He is absolutely correct . What he doesn't realize is , he's admitting that the criterion that he and the rest of Lefraud 's lackeys routinely regurgitate of him making it to 9 straight finals ( or whatever it is ) , somehow makes him GOAT worthy   is ridiculous . Which we've said all along . Nevermind the losing record . So please , someone let Keyshawn know , he should never , ever ,  ever mention Lefraud going to the finals 9 or 10 straight times and only winning 4 to try to say he's great . He just correctly stated  , if you don't win it , it doesn't register !
Love Paul Pierce he’s a great host
Lebron making reservations for Cancun
keyshawn you damn BUM !
Noooo ain’t no way lebron got bounced first round 😂😂😂 let me guess it was AD fault or the coach fault
I love Paul Pierce's Suit for this show.  Plaid for the Spring, vest in addition to tie and jacket.  Classy.😊
People forget this is prime Murray and he dunked on a 39 year old. Prime Bron 27-28 years old that wouldn’t have happened. Let’s see how Murray play at 39👌🏽
Night Night Lakers 😴😴😴
AD fell like he got shot 😂😂😂
Any other team?? Lol they would have been destroyed by the Timberwolves, Thunder, Celtics, Knicks...
Two L.A. dudes clowning
Joker put uo 25 and 20 despite not attempting a FT. That's what MVP's do. They roll with the punches.
‘We close’ you lost 12 out of 13 you ain’t close
Damn, Lil Wayne 🔥.
2 Buzzer beaters for last second wins… Against the defending champs (they repeating) and yall acting like the Lakers are sorry GTFOH
Paul Pierce's Wheel Chair Game? 😂
What is that opening 🏴‍☠️
11:34 Skip tripping, I ain’t trying to feel someone else’s ACL tear.
I’m glad Pierce shut down that Jared Vanderbilt talk .. They be bringing him up like he’s a star or impact role player
Never enough help for Lebron according to these guys. Smh.
Yall sleeping on Arron Gordon’s efforts and tenacity!
Lebron to WARRIORS to play with Steph Curry,  Draymond,  CP3 and Coach Kerr.
Lil weezy go hard at the beginning! First time seeing 🔥🔥
Keyshawn with the excuses 😂
AD plays with the Goat of faking injuries
😂😂😂 Skip had to bring up the wheelchair game with Paul 💀💀
Look at Keyshawn when Skip mentions the "pooped myself" game
Keshon.. suck!
Looks like AD got taken out by the same mystery injury that took out Zion. Mafia?
Murry dunked on lebron😂
We need to move on from LeBron. He is not going to win a chip for us. Every year we play for a playin spot and that's it. We lowered our bar for him by hanging up midseason championship or whatever that dum ish is called. It's unacceptable.   If FO really is going to extend him for max and draft Bronny then I am done with the Lakers for the next three years.
Sad that KCP out there Cookin'em!! 🔥 why Lakers trade him ?
The Western Conference finals is gonna be the Timberwolves versus OKC and I think the Timberwolves are going to edge out a victory over OKC but it’s gonna be a close close series. It’s gonna go to game 7 you heard it here first and it will be the Timberwolves versus the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals
Even the title have to mention the Lakers first. Insread of the nuggets eliminates the Lakers it has to the Lakers eliminated by the nuggets.
I only watch cuz of the Truth
Keyshawn is such a boring tv personality.
Mr Pierce bringing that truth
Paul Pierce was a great addition to this show. Guys hilarious😭😭
I know this was hard for Key
Stop crying! The Lakers, lost. Next!
Paul Pierce was a smart addition
nick wright - ''the closest gentleman sweep ever, in history, only lebron can do that" lol
paul pierce an OGGG
Lakers ten less turnovers 20 more free throws and still lost. Straight bums
This show is like First Things First, And others, They only talk about the Celtics whenever they Lose. 🤦‍♂️😅😂🤣
Poor Pierce forgot a game is 48 minutes not 44. Homienyou used to be in the league cmon oldhead
6-0 > 4-6
Klownshaw Johnson 😂😂😂 I’m not as much of an avid hater of his but that nickname is comedy lol
AD= ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!, Worst investment in NBA History!
Good Effort tho Lakeshow. Denver just had perfect execution
Someone needs to get this fool Key off the show. What a dumb man.
Thank you Paul Pierce
Fats0 Keshawn was celebrating Murrays injury yesterday openly on air but Karma came swiftly! How ya feelin buddy? 😂
19:26 That comment by Keyshawn tells me he is the worst analyst out there. Zero objectiveness. The whole world can see it was a foul, only he can look the other way. Has he never hooped? What AD was doing absolutely has an effect on your shot! Get this guy off the show man.
pp is a biased and should not be so subjective .. jealous
Paul stop drinking they wasn’t beating the twolves or okc brah
Keyshawn looks emotionally damaged.😂😂😂😂
“I’m not worried about Denver” -Lebron
He goes down like he got shot!  I’m weak! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No Vando meant it would be tough for the Lakers to win.
Dwight Howard offered to help the Lakers guard Jokic
Thank God the Nuggets will finally get fair ref calls now that the Lakers are out of the playoffs.  Watching the Lakers cry, complain and flop game after game despite getting every call is so annoying to me at this point. Jokic had ZERO free throw attempts in the game.  I do think that the Nuggets lose to the T-Wolves if they shoot like they have been against the Lakers.  Jokic is the only efficient player throughout this past series.
Keyshawn Johnson celebrating Murrays injury yesterday and then Murray plays only to breaks the Lakers heart again. Love to see those Fakers exposed.
Joker comit a lot of fouls that do not get called.  Raises questions.
Malone doesnt call timeout was key. Malone didnt allow lakers to change personnel to up their defense.  Murray against Reaves....Nuggets will take that all night.
The 'Blaming Darwin Ham' narrative 🙄 is getting stale. I get that some of his decision-making has been Sus  but Players gotta make Free throws, get back on defense, and Box out for Rebounds. Many of these games in this series could have Gone either way which would have lead to different outcomes. Props to Mike Malone and the Nuggets for their Solid teamwork.
Kobe and MJ would play with an arm missing. AD is soft
Sub 20k views…..dang
Keys looking like he living in hotel. On his way to a divorce.
now i can take a break and come back to watch the nba final
What is that? 5:34
PP is a hater!
Wayne is genius……
Pierce is bland
Lakers just need to let go ledrama James he is the king and MVP for inn season chip and the goat he won game 4 to going fishing great goat.
Ppl forget that rondo was sitting on Murray in the bubble and Dwight was making it rough for jokic as well
FAKErs are trash !!
Good Morning!!!
Russell is a no show in the past two postseasons.
This mf skip gonna say gm unless ur a lakers fan great im done watching i was already hurting 🥲😭😭😂😂
Paulina pierce has ptsd from Lebron getting in his back side so many times
Shoutout Keyshawn Johnson. dude celebrated Jamal’s injury for Jamal to get the game winner again lmfao
Pathetic LAGUNEROS!!!!
5:35 dad?
Its just basketball
The Lakers coach fell into pressure by his team to use up a challenge that although did work out, also cost them a crucial timeout that could of advanced them the ball mid-court for a proper final shot. Even though the challenge was successful, the Lakers didn't capitalize on the opportunity and killed their final shot opportunity. This was the result of Lebron's tantrum from the previous game for not challenging, at this point, the players are coaching the coach, not the coach coaching the players. If I'm management, I'm seeking a new coach, the players don't respect the current one enough and therefore bad decisions are being made because of it.
Just remember.  They won the bs in season tournament
The difference between these teams is coaching and the fact that lebrun has low BB IQ.   He is simply NOT A closer, never has been except for a few games that we always here about. Boston game 6, detroit ECF, spurs game 7... But that was really POP leaving him wide open  That does not happen anymore due to his diminished speed.
LeBron is so selfish.
They need to trade Lebron to the Wizards or the Clippers or something   (;
Paul is a joker 😂
Well Pierce I want to see WHT you say about Minnesota when they win
If cam reddish played I think we win with his defense ..him on Murray coupe helped 😊
Paul Pierce should be Official co host
Can't never see what they are seeing on the screen, smh
this is the reason why MJ is the GOAT. imagine the things he had to endure during his time just to get where he is, all the achievements he got. it's funny how these  today's NBA players make a movie during a game. they're trying to get a story and a climactic ending to their game but fail miserably by losing. imagine if the LAL won the game what the headlines will be? imagine kobe making freethrows with a torn achilles' compared to that AD shoulder bump. it's funny AF! and the LBJ so-called injury then he doesn't want to get out of the court. it's all for the show. they thought they could win with all those drama and BS hahahaha
All these excuses lol. If LeBron boxes out and grabs one of those 2 late rebounds the lakers win
“He wrapped his arm around him but not enough to affect his shot” - Man who knows basketball
If If If. Lakers lost and if don’t change a thing
The NBA should do something about this coach’s challenge you should keep your time back cuz the teams paying for Refs mistakes 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Yay no more laker talk
They should have gave A.D. some Kratom.
Prince told Rui to help on Murray. And bro did his best LeBron impression
Can't believe skip is actually defending LeBron lol
I’m a Laker but 27-9 free throws is disgusting
this show sucks
Lakers going to be mid
Denver won't win it all GUAAARANTEEED 😂😂😂
Paul Pierce made this show watchable... Keyshawn need to go
waitin for that paul pierce clapback when his celtics get knocked out such a hater man
No apology from Keyshawn after he squealed like a school girl hearing Murray was hurt yesterday? Bro deserves to get cooked 🤡
Only thing Lakers are celebrating right now is not getting swept and making the playoffs and Lebron making it another year. That’s what they’re toasting right now
Skip Is clearly being fake at this point… somebody from Klutch sports has gotten to him…
No matchup for AG is where it starts
LaBrick is the BUBBLE GOAT
Paul talk good talk but he’s a bron hater period!!!
If y’all watch the game , jokic and mal Murray was cooking AD
That exactly what I said call Pierce Paul Pierce. He’s a dumb very low IQ. He just say the Lakers need to out play Denver for the full 44 minutes he didn’t finish even elementary school and I am sure he was f student 12x4=48 not 44 but he has money and he is black so he is on television if he was white with his IQ he will be mapping the floor in the television room over here black is king
"That right there, when i managed to only get gentleman swept by Denver, that made me the Greatest Of All Time" - Lebron James
Keyshawn looked sick when Paul handed him that shirt. He be giving Key the blues 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I watch because Paul now 😂
MPJ was the biggest reason. 26 points on 8-12 shooting, 5-7 from three.
As a Laker fan, I hope this is Bron's last season. I'm so tired of him and since the bubble, this is a play-in team. Time to move on. The old guard is done.
LaBrick always has excuses
Keshawn keeps talking about their close. A play in team that got gentlemen swept wtf
I only tune in for Paul lol
In any game you have to outplay your opponent to the end. Paul pierce opening take was horrible, the Lakers would’ve lost to any of the other teams in the west. AD and Lebron put up those numbers all season and we had a LOSING season. He’s gaslighting because he’s biased
Keyshawn is gonna get mad one day and snap on one of these two 😂 he always looks irritated
Keyshawn has more excuses than a pregnant nun!
McDaniels vs Porter Jr. Gonna be the x factor next series
thats why jordan is the goat😊
That lil Wayne intro so fire
Paul is really a hater fr let’s be real he be so glad when Labron fails
Wayne spitting 🔥
Remember when Keyshawn said “lakers and suns in WCF” 😂😂😂😂😂
Amazing video 🎉.
Lebron gave up 2 offensive rebounds in the last 3 mins. Not gonna talk about that?🙄
Cant stand Keyshawn‼ He overtalks too much! And he's a natural born Hater and very annoying
".....like he got shot" lmao
I’m just here to see if Skip acknowledges that Lebron made both critical free throws at the end of the
Ad fell like he got shot lol jeez he is soft 😂😂😂😂😂
12 outta of 13 ain’t close haha
they just should've been the eighth seed
Keyshawn celebrating an injury yesterday = instant karma today. 😂
Trade Lebron, get AD some help now
Skip stay hating i know he know that Malone never said tjat
Oh what a day lebum is eliminated
Paul Pierce is the only one who knows what hes talking about with baaketball, because he actually played basketball. Keyshawn and Skip are both idiots.
Shoutout to Spencer for missing those 2 freethrows at the end 💯
Darvin Ham does not know how to call timeouts 3rd Quarter when Denver went on they run call a time out. Mike Malone as soon as the Lakers tie the game 87-87 Denver calls a timeout. That's the difference throughout this entire series coaching
Show is better than 1st take
Lebron is Paul’s daddy. We remember what happened Paul. Wolves about to destroy Nugs and Ant will be Jamal’s daddy
I beat you 12 outta 13 you're my son😎💯
I can't believe I heard them say Lebron should have had a foul called for him in the final few minutes.. when Jokic was 0-0 from the free throw line all game...
Where's a goat when you need one thought a 3peat was on the way
Bron Lost so much that everyone brought up all the “ what if’s “
Jamal Murray made a shot, AGAIN 🎉
That intro fire
bro that weezy intro goes hard
Keyshawn: They brushed up against AD and he went down. 😂😂😂. Very passive aggressive...
Vic Lombardi said the during the parade not Malone.
12 outta 13? Yet true but since 22’ Lakers are 3-15 against Denver. They had a better chance going against OKC.
I’m so over KeyShawn he’s irritating on the show
2023/24 Mid Season Champion ladies and gentlemen the Los Angeles Lakers .... 😅
Timberwolves over Denver in 6 games.  Book it
Keyshawn makes this show unwatchable....
Shay n Kee are the reason alots don't like the l8kers they 🤡s when speaking on them
Not going to say their more talented..just they executed when it mattered the most
AD looked dominant and proved himself through this series. Lebron is done.
I love Keyshawn man lol.
I like Paul and Key. GREAT SHOW
I love Paul Pierce
AD is soft.
Guess what haters (Paul Pierce included).....and the beat goes on baaaaaaaaaa🐐👑 i prayer you poor souls find TRUE strength cause this ain't it 😂😊🙏
The bigger the game the smaller LeBron gets!!
Paul Pierce is intelligent and funny-- these other guys need to get a sense of humor.
Hehehe who’s your daddy…. Keyshawn is a sourpuss? Hehehe. The banner is up! The didn’t get swept banner opening night watch it. Pierce is the only reason I tolerate this show. He is good should’ve went with Barkley on tnt that would be fun.
You know Paul pierce and skip is happy lol 😂
It's crazy how easy it is for Paul to show so much hate toward a 39 year old player. OH nevermind LeBron is who ended his relevance in the NBA and made him a journey man. Let it go Paul, it makes you look worse than skip for tryna make a 2nd career by speaking this man's name over and over.
I love how Keyshawn never sticks to a topic
IM HERE FOR PAUL PIERCE, DONT  @ ME !!!!!!
30 free throws is crazy,
Paul Pierce might save this show
12:07  “Paul’s a big dude!”  Paul: *YEA* 😤  “…them dudes are even bigger than Paul!  Paul: No! No, no. 🤨
HAHAHA LAKERS LOST 😂😂😂
Bro the chemistry between Paul and Keyshawn is weird. And is slowly dragging this show down.
Lakers 27 free throws to Nuggets 9 free throws. Nuggets were still able to beat lakers and the refs!!
Pierce smiling in the thumbnail...lol...he hates Bron!
Pierce smiling in the thumbnail...lol...he hates Bron!
Pierce smiling in the thumbnail...lol...he hates Bron!
Pierce smiling in the thumbnail...lol...he hates Bron!
Paul took a poop in his wheelchair game Ship
Hahaha Skip became a Laker fan to get more ratings
That Lakers Bubble championship is starting to look a lot more understandable
Christmas in April for Paul and Skip smh
Austin reeves showed up in the end his good he’s gonna be great when they get rid of dlo to give him more opportunities.  But the moment AD went out they lost.
I love how the title says Lebron Eliminated by the nuggets as if Lebron is the only player on the lakers 😂😂😂
Jarred Vanderbilt 😂😂😂 Paul look like he was going to take that and smoke it lol Skip and Keyshawn really arguing with Paul that he would have made a difference
When they going to say LBJ go check Jamal we can lose this game and that’s why he not the goat at some point you have to check there best perimeter score
The so called G.O.A.T unable to get another ring to catch up with Kobe.
Time to retire Leflop! Get off the team and give me back my Lakers!
Happy Lakers were eliminated.  It's so boring constantly talking about them and LJ.  Over it.
The Nuggets can be a dynasty with this CURRENT roster, not just because they are top tier talented, but because of conditioning! Teams can try to match their talent, but they'll never be able to match their talent AND stamina because of the altitude!  Only way is if teams train all season in hyperbaric chambers to prepare for a seven game series in high altitude.
This show blows
Undisputed fall off gotta be studied
I don’t watch this trash but I bet there was no discussion of Lebron acting like he was gonna hit a woman for yelling at him in the front row and then mocking her reaction.
“Jamal Murray made a shot.” -  AD 😂
That opener bruh 🔥🔥🔥
I fw Paul
I just googled what butthurt meant. Keshawn picture came up😂😂😂😂😂
At this point Id say send keyshawn home until football season. Swallow your pride and bring on Jalen Roses to go with Paul Pierce for Basketball
Bro AD needs to go,he is not it. Austin Reeves cant play a lick of def,and The coach is just 🧠☠️. Lebron needs to be a 3rd option but Lakers need a whole new team 🤦🏾
Not sure MPJ is a 3rd option...I thing AG is
Lakers played amazing.. second best team in the league. Nuggets lucky Lebron is 40   Nuggets were amazing
They really made a Weezy theme that doesn’t mention Shannon, and it’s🔥
NOOOOO MIN will demolish DEN...yall pineal's are just closed
Piece getting on key nerves and i love it 😂😂😂
We are in the midst of an era that’s coming to an end. Lebron, KD and Steph out the playoffs 😢
Out of 9 playoff games the lakers beat them 1 time.  Yet they’re speaking like LA dominated them.  Nothing about Murray not being able to be as aggressive as normal, nothing about Reggie Jackson leaving last game early, nothing about KCP playing just as hurt as AD.  The only reason this game and the last one was close was because the nuggets were settling for outside shots, the Joker included.  Look back at the free throw attempt differential between the teams.  Even if they had a timeout and Reeves tied it somehow, my money is on Jamal Murray and Joker in overtime.  This is why it’s bad to get the champs who are rolling in the first round.
Paul Pierce is a great addition. He's hilarious.  Keyshawn really does not add much tbh.
P has always been good for tv, him and KG!
Paul never-let-it-go Pierce is at the top of the Himalayas with all that salt 😂😂😂
Pierce is my fav. Glad hes back on tele
I got a green one for you it's your size too 🫣😱😱😱😱
So I guess it would be way to simple to say that Lakers had a 27-9 ft advantage and missed 8 of them. In a 2 point game! Don't blame the refs, they did their part
I can’t believe Paul pierce got me watching undisputed again
The weezy theme song is keeping this show relevant!!
Anthony Edward's he's going  be the nuggets Kryptonite
Vanderbilt??? Cmon Skip...
I'm so sick of Jamal Murray 🤬
I thought both teams played well.
Murray cooked the lakers guards
Minnesota vs Denver will be a much more competitive series.
Wayne just get a haircut all that hair coloring messed up your hair.
The Denver nuggets are Going back all the way to the NBA finals but the nuggets still have to win 2 more series To go  at their Conference finals
Looked up laker Repellant and a bottle with Aaron Gordon’s face came up.. they don’t have the personnel to stop his rebounds, points or being constantly open to shift the defense for an open pass from him.
Paul pierce is an important hater whever he is life…….. dude still think he’s a Celtic and has always hated the Lakers!!
Enjoy your early 7  regular season game Tournament cup 🥤 LeBron 😂😂
Its lebrons fault. He pushed ham to challenge because of his weird actings on court when he doesnt get his way.
Don’t let this show distract you from Kendrick, dropping his disc record to Drake today
Keyshawn is so cringe & whiny. Can't take a joke for nothing.
When AD went down like he dying during the commercial i said when the game come back on I better see doctors 🥼 doing life saving surgery on him 🤦🏾‍♂️
Michael Jordan over Ehlo shot for sure.
Too many PAUSE No Diddy Quotables here.
The truth 🙌 💯
Clownshawn Johnson richly deserves this for openly celebrating the Murray injury yesterday
Mike Malone never said he was  the Lakers daddy, it was some announcer,  at the parade
Im glad the Nuggets won. Jamal killed it, Levron played respectable but whoever said he "added 3s to his bag" is clearly blind he still sucjs if not he's just an average 38%. Great, fun series and im excited for the next rounds.
Keyshawn hair pisses me off. Looks like the black kids in mighty ducks.
2020 title for Lebron was his only title where he wasn’t on a super team
If they would have played any other team except OKC, Wolves , Mavs and pbbly Clippers.  So yeah
Intro song still go hard no Diddy😅💪🔥💯💯
Skip and pierce are pure haters. I'm a neutral but their obvious jealousy of lebron is quite sad when it comes from grown and successful adults. I didnt see this same energy when the suns got beaten
I like this trio...you all have got different views to the game. nice intro from lil Wayne.
it's funny to hear Skip calling himself analyst lol. he reads stats I can give him that lol. this includes stephen A smith and a whole bunch other ESPN people. Tim Legler is not included though.
Skip need to lighten up on this show hes so wound tight and reserved anymore
Crooked refs need to be investigated for influencing the outcome of the game and manipulating stats. Zero free throws for Jokic is criminal and someone should be prosecuted.
What happened to Sherm? Is he only for football season?
Key is going to give that shirt back to Paul after the finals.
Intro song by Weezy is FIRE AF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀🏆🏆
Suck your mamma Pierce
AYO SKIP WILD FOR SAYING HE DONT KNOW HURT PAUL WAS IN THAT WHEEL CHAIR GAME 😂 KEYSHAWN COULDNT EVEN KEEP HIS COMPOSURE 😂 THE 💩 GAME
The lakers had a foul to give coaching mistakes over and over again
Nuggets won because Lakers coaching is terrible !!!
Yeah some one who played the game not nfl players speaking on nba
Darvin Ham had to call timeouts becuse lebron was gassed at times.
Aaron Gordon and Kcp and porter are damn near all stars
The best thing about this show is the theme song lol
Why do you think darvin challenged? He was pressured by you know who bc of the temper tantrum this player showed on national TV and now coach is getting ready to get fired that is messed up
Finally the LA Fakers are gone. Lets move on with the new era. KD, Curry and LeBum are in the rearview mirror😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
I am enjoying Paul on the show, robbing it in.
When Kayshaun speaks I turn my volume down to mute.
MPJ is better than anyone on the lakers outside of AD and Lebron
Murray's mind set was PLAY NOW REST LATER..
Does Paul not realize that there are different grades of calf strains? Should we tell him guys? 😂
You need to talk more about lakers...
Pierce wasnt hurt at all, he was just letting the truth out
Props to Jokic for not missing a free throw this game. Was 0/0. Respect.
Key needs to go.
It’s all good lakers already won their in season trophy 😂
aye S/O M porter, I see bro being a main starter on a team next year, he gritty now ! Not on the lightskin shenanigans😂
Keyshawn was hot like a “stack of pancakes” after that shirt!!!! Paul:😅😅😅😅😅
Ref tried to help 9 ft Denver to Lakers 27 ft. LeBron isn't a goat. Duration of playing 21 seasons should make him no goat. Other players, played less and accomplished more. Kobe and MJ less seasons and done more. So stop the goat conversation. Also, LeBron has had 6 six coaches fired and won 4 chips. The same factor in all equations is LeBron...done!
If after watching this series and you dont think the Lakers couldve used Dwight Howard for rebounding, defense and paint protection then you are out of your mind. I dont care what anyone says, Dwight Howard would've been perfect for this series.   Not only should lebron his leverage to get Bronny on the team but he should alway use it to het Howard back on the team.
Aaron Gordon was not boxed out by LeBron.  Offensive Rebounds for the Series: Gordon  18 LeBron 4
Paul Pierce saved this show.
I never watch skip anymore😂 but wayne on the intro song is funny to me, not because of wayne hes my GOAT, but i just can picture skip riding into work every morning just rapping along
Paul doesn't remember being carried off the court with a fake injury 😂😂😂😂😂
Who's your daddy 🤣😂
I see that Key still has a job…
Big shout out to Richard Shernan, much love bro!
I see that Key still has a job…
I don’t want to hear “the Lakers would’ve won if AD didn’t hurt his shoulder.” First of all, Murray was playing through an injury this whole game as well. Secondly, this was the healthiest AD has been since the Bubble, and thirdly what about the other 3 games they won with AD healthy the entire series. In 2020, Giannis went down when his team was already down 3-0 to the Heat, they won the fourth game and lost the last one without Giannis. Nobody said “the Heat would’ve lost with Giannis playing” even though Giannis missed more time thag series than AD did here because that’s ridiculous. Finally, he got hurt in the third quarter of a 6 point game, in a series where the Lakers had blown double didi gy leads almost every game and lost 11/12 games previously.
Can't believe that I agree with Paul Pierce on a Lakers take. He's right. The Lakers beat any other team in the playoffs (including what we will see in the NBA Finals), just like last year. This was the best series in the playoffs, just that it happened in the first round because the Lakers came in at #7.
"They brushed up against him"
Wow that was the best wayne track I’ve heard since 2010 😂
put key on the shelf until football comes back lol
"The nuggets have won 12 of the last 13"  SKIP - "But they were all down to the wire"  😂😂😂 since when is being close count??
Told you Keyshawn Nuggets in 5
Please make Paul Pierce a staple of this show🫱🏾‍🫲🏽
Bron 30,9 and 11 with 4 steals   Meanwhile no one else on lakers can get 20 points.   Denver had 3 players with 20+ points
Keyshawn said they are close 😂. They said that last year.
Skip and Paul faces are full of joy hahah
LAKERS ELIMINATED, IM DONE WATCHING THIS SHOW & NBA TILL SUMMER 😭💯
I literally spoke the truth about Murray on a video I made on my TikTok before the game and it all came true GO NUGGETS
Lebron getting revenge next season
There goes wheelchair paul again 😂
Lil Waynes intro is the best part of this show
Skip Bayless really the biggest LeBron fan in the world
Man get this Keshawn fool outta here. Talkin bout "Ir don't matter if they loose the Finals". It does matter because the Nugs won and ur Lakers lost. They're ur daddy, and what's important is that they beat you
Key sucks as a analyst he got the personality of a brick! Paul is much better! Fire key! Keep Paul I bet ratings went up when Paul joined.
Close sweep followed by a close gentleman sweep. Progress les go lakers🎉😅
I am calling it now, Lakers in 9.
I turn off whenever Keyshawn talks. Just annoying with no POV.
Paul Pierce Is The Biggest Lebron Hater Ever, Bron Will Have His Revenge Watch LOL, Hire And Fire Type Situation 😂😂😂
I actually believe that, The Lakers would've beat any other team in the West and made it to the finals of they didn't have to play Denver first
In life, it is super important to learn from mistakes . The lakers were better off fouling murray with 15 left on the clock and give themself the chance to tie or win with a 3s. I would rather have a last shot with no time that die without a chance
That team was not rattled by cheating referees!
I really won Boston to go down because all that laughing Paul is doing. He thinks its wrap and  Boston gets the chip
At least they are in season champs of the world CRAIG!!!! 😂
“They brushed up against him and he fell to the ground”😭😭
Bron and catering to him is why the Lakers remain play in game contenders barely. Murray just owns Bron and is clutch unlike Bron. 😂
Whats crazy is Jokic on a off night had 25, 20 and 9
Lakers are the 2nd-4th best team in the west. They would’ve beat everyone except Denver, maybe Minnesota, maybe Dallas, and maybe clippers if healthy (which they never are), I think they bring in a dejounte Murray and a real impact big they’re right there
Pls get rid of Keyshawn he’s hurting the show
11:18 😂😂😂 got shot
Lakers challenged the call because Baby 23 might cry again... thus no more timeouts. 😆
How can Skip not know that Paul Pierce accidentally pooped and pretended to be injured so can clean himself up in the bathroom.  You could see Keyshawn laughing. Paul Pierce keeping a straight face is hilarious!!  He admitted it himself long ago. lol.
I know Murray and Jokic will get the attention, but let's give MPJ his flowers. 23 ppg and 8.5 rpg shooting 55% and 49% from 3 for the series. Everyone thought the off the court stuff was going to affect him, but it seems like it made him more focused. He hit a lot of big 3s when it seemed like the Lakers were about to go on a run.
Poor AD, freak things happen, he played great this series. This is from a Nuggets fan.
Look at this 🤡 key Shawn making excuses. LeBalco has the most playoff losses in NBA history. LeBalco has the most losses in NBA history period
"Jokic was 0-0 he didnt miss a free throw tonight" - Michael Malone
Lebron you are a natural at championship pedigree pressure so and with that your motivation and not self servant is greatness in this case rings. You are world recognized as leader of the whole NBA verse said reflection or better of Sir Jordan in that you need not worry now about franchises. That is the point honestly if a player option and utilizing it to its fullest potential as you have you must understand its foundation which is purely movement. A trip around I would would take before I hang up my shoes and move on to more adventures.
He Brong out the who’s your daddy T-shirt a little bit too early. now who looks like the a**
Is that true keyshawn was rooting for murray to get hurt? 🤔 key aint like that right?
Keyshon Denver jus better  LAKERS need more scorers NO MORE TALK
Why people act like they forgot how Jordan & Kobe looked at 39 but talk about LeBron losing at age 39 lol. 😂
Did Lebron even play good this series?
The Truth all over Jamals nuts😂
Delete Keyshawn and bring in Max Kellerman🫡
Wonder want the plans are now. Who he thinking about joining because if you can see, no superstar comes to play with him. He has to go to where they are. That says a lot. If you're the so called GOAT, why can't he get superstars to come to where he is nor keep a coach if he doesn't get his way. Hmmm interesting. And this is coming from a 30 year Lakers fan.
AD going down was the nail in the ⚰️ last night
Intro stays 🔥
We need a coach that understands you never allow another team to have the last shot. Phil Jackson would have made someone foul Murray, so we would have the last shot 😢
Hamm, "alright y'all. At least we didn't get swept this time, only a 4-1 loss. Maybe next year we can actually win 2 games, thats an improvement. Whatcha think Lebron?"
Bringing up the wheelchair game 😂 does no one remember that paul said on live TV he had to go to the bathroom
i'd love to hear anyone on television talk about the free throw disparity.. and address the blatant no calls
Oh well.  Denver 4-1🙂🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
i dont know how this is possible... i want curry, durant and lebron to finish out their careers together.   i dont care what team.   give them all the epo, gh, tes in the world and let them get a couple.
That lil Wayne intro hard af
Paul pierce is great bro 😭😭😭
Lebron getting that rebound snatched from him late in the 4th that gave the Nuggets an extra possession that turned out to be a three from Murray was the start of the end for the Lakers. They was up two had momentum  would've had a chance to push the lead back to 5 and instead ended up down two.
Paul Pierce makes this show better
That intro is dope. Best intro and crew of all sports shows.
Paul Pierce brought me back to the show 😮, as for the Lakers …. Lebron wasted 2 seasons in La, should have abandoned ship long time ago!!!
Need to worry about them celtics, because if Porzingas is out they in trouble the rest of the way
What’s funny is the difference was the benches. Both starting line ups had 95 but lakers bench had 11 while Denver’s had 13 the final score difference was 2 points the exact difference between the benches (numerically of course game flow it was Murray)
Wayne intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought this show is analysis! Key is just lakers cheerleader
Disgusting
Die hard Nuggets fan here, I am scared to play the Wolves.
Those guys were past their prime besides  A D
Here lies LeBron James He needed more help 💀💀💀
Paul Pierce is a sucka.. I remember he got poked up and almost lost his life in Boston for being a slime ball trying to holler at somebody else's wife..
I said it before the series even started. If D'LO didn't outplay Murray in this series lakers was going home. Trade him and Rui and fire Coach Ham
The lakers wasn't a super team in the bubble STOP EXAGGERATION
As a Dubs fan, I’m glad my boy, Austin Tyler Reaves showed out down the stretch and glad for coach Mike Malone. ❤
That poop head Paul pierce is gonna save undisputed…
LeFraud is the most overrated athlete of all time😂😂😂
ESPN is literally running segments about getting LeBron more help. You can’t make this up. 🤣🤣🤣
Is AD really that soft???
I just realized who Keyshawn sounds like…Damon Wayans in prison In Living Color 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣that’s why I can’t take it lmao
Lebron james is by far the best athlete of all-time . Period . And this is coming from a jordan fan .
Key is trippin! AD is a liability.
LeBron James need to retire
Why does Keyshawn dress like a substitute teacher? Sleeves are not long enough, half the time shirt isn’t tucked in
doesn't matter, Antman gonna spank the Nuggets
That Wayne intro tho. TOUGH!
The Lakers took and missed too many 3s. That’s the story
If Porzingis wasn't there Anthony davis will hold the award for the softest center USA basketball that have ever witnessed
Lakers gonna hang their “First Round Participation” banner next to their In Season Tournament banner!
I love how Paul is trolling Key hahaaha. Key does not know anything about basketball he should be quiet
Who's going to guard antman?
I wouldn’t mind having a young coach !  jst look at OKC !!! we need a coach that can relate to the players but yet earns respect in the locker room
Weezy on that intro!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Micheal Porter Jr!!!! Mans was a “should take first anyway” type guy during that draft lmaoooo crazy
Bron Bron flinching at a GIRL court side 😂 Nuggets fan literally broke this bum
OKC is the youngest team in NBA history to sweep a team in the first round... plus, they beat Denver 3 in a row... how come that's not the topic..
You can’t just say if the lakers would of played any other team they would of won we don’t know that nothing guaranteed in the nba!
I’m not a big lebron fan but I have the up most respect for him and definitely top my hat off to him , especially at his age to do what he’s going is amazing 💯. Wolves vs Nuggets next round, can’t wait!
Nuggets are just a better team than the lakers. Trae young incoming
4 for 21......thats some Goat...
I love that intro 🔥🔥🔥
must fired coach darvin ham...
Thanks for the great season. See you guys in the summer for Olympic ball
Paul Pierce ain’t no important addition to this show, please
LeBalco has proved through out his career he struggles against all time bigs in the playoffs ! Ben Wallace 0-1, Duncan 1-2, KG 2-2, Dwight 0-1, Dirk 0-1, Joker 1-2. That’s a 4-9 record for a pathetic 30% win rate. That includes 2 sweeps & 2 gentlemen sweeps 😂😂😂😂🤣
LeBron teams seems to always be bad...starting to look ridiculous now
Just here for Keyshawn tears
At least the Lebron got them  an in-season tourney banner. Lebron can make a ring for himself and call it a chip 😂😂😂  🙃🙃
No Moral Victories Paul, stop Being Nice Jokic and Murray are LeBalco and Ant Davis daddy
"Even in your wheel chair game" I think skip might know what happened lol
Paul got real quiet when skip brought up the wheel chair game 🤣💩
Apparently Paul thinks Minnesota is a cake walk 🙄 wolves taking lakers out also
Was he really hurt tho?
They better get some good sleep eat their Wheaties and say their prayers for the young T wolves lol 😂
Great Job Nuggets for Eliminating LeBalco and His Minions on The Internet and on TV/Media... He hasn’t done Anything In The WEST Except For Missing the Playoffs & 1 & Done's 💯
paul starts off immediately wrong.... "denver is just more talented than the lakers"... absolutely false... you take each player talent by talent and do like a out of 100 points, player ranker type of thing, the lakers do not have less talent than nuggets.... what the nuggets have is a jokic that raises TEAM PLAY higher than any other player in the nba... kcp, gordon, porter... none of them are what they are on the nuggets if they play anywhere else... and obviously the fact that jokic and murray are always clutch down the stretch let's them get wins all the time that should be 50/50.... somehow they end up winning 8 out of every 10 of these games....it wasn't a talent issue at all... it was mental toughness and clutchness
Keyshawn has a loser mentality. As a high level competitor you should want your opponent as healthy as possible for no excuses to be have.  Nuggets are just a better team and there's no shame in losing to a better team.
That undisputed theme is amazing.
Maybe Kd Steph lebron should retire... let the young dudes take over...
Wear the SHIRT KEYSHWAN 🤣🤣🤣
Keyshawn shut up with those excuses

I’m really trying to give this show a chance, but it’s hard for me to get into it now.
I'm just glad the series is over. I will resume my Laker "fandom" when lebron leaves the team or retires
Listening to Keyshawn is like... i can't even explain it... Just get the f out of there man...
Intro  bumps! Paul pierce is a great addition to the show as well
Keshaun bum johnson
Nobody watching playoffs this year maybe for Anthony Edwards
I’m still disappointed with Keyshawn practically rooting for Jamal’s injury…
I knew Nuggets were going to win
Timberwolves will knock out Nuggets. I’m calling Minnesota in 5 🔥🔥
these lebron fans really thinking they got this after winning game4...  and blames the injury..  yall forgetting, your very own 2020 bubble lakers faced each west opponents missing key players..  then go on to ifnals versus heat missing 2players also..
AD played great, but Mr. Glass will always be Mr. Glass!
Paul P. Starting to get that Stephen A. hairline 😮... skip doing it again.
How can we take all these sports debate shows talking heads seriously . When they all were acting like Lakers were championship contenders. They were the play in team for a reason 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s always about Lebron, Dlo and reeves fell short again, 3 more points from either and lakers would have won.
Jokic gonna BBQ chicken Gobert
Jaxson Hayes please that’s why I would’ve got Dwight but he black balled right now
Wayne intro so tuff
Lebron only chance at another ring is to take a huge pay cut and at his age he should if he cares about championships. . He doesn’t need the money .  Take 12mil a year and get better talent around you .  6 to 8 years ago he could carry this team but not anymore.
Keyshawn and lebron need to retire
Lebron and the refs were able to get 1 win in the last 13 games against Denver. Having taken over 3x more free throws and leading the majority of the time. Thats why Lebron is the goat. Another early exit for Lebron. All because his coach and his teammates weren’t good enough. He only had 2 all stars and 1 top 75 of all time player in this roster. He needs more help 🐐. Only a real goat would lose in the first round. Get Lebron a young star studded team with Edwards, Jokic, maybe throw in Tatum and Shai and I bet he wins another ring.
Skip you need a show moderator
ESPN/Fox Sports promoting Lakers is ridiculous. They were the play in team they weren’t beating anyone stop lying.
Nah Paul is hilarious 😂 . It’s only right that Keyshawn wears the shirt in my opinion
Not even the refs could help the Flakers win. They get 27 v 9 FT and they still manage to lose
1:59 yep. Ummhmm
Referees were the Lakers Mvp. And still wasn't enough 😅😅😅😅😅
Stupid modern basketball shooting 10-35 on wide open 3s instead of going inside which worked for them all night
PAUL: Not the biggest but a huge piece  ME: 😂😊😅
Jokic and Murray will get most of the praise but MPJ was the x-factor. He played a lot better than last year
Where is that Joke Keyshawn? His take yesterday was asinine and pathetic from a so-called sports analysis.
As a Lakers fan this is funny!!! Get Lebron outta town!!!!
LeBron was 28-7-9 in this playoff series. He's still playing at an insanely high level. Post All-Star break only Jokic & Luka have played better.   If he wants to win his 5th title then the Sixers & Knicks makes sense. Sixers haven't won a title in over 40 years, Knicks haven't won a title in over 50 years. If he wins a chip with either, it would greatly enhance his legacy.
From popping champagne in December to barely making the playoffs only to get a gentleman’s sweep
Thank you Paul for saying what’s needed to be said about these “difference” makers of Gabe Vincent and jarred Vanderbilt. Them being out majority of year and coming back wasn’t gonna do anything
See what happens when Lebron has to play Joker in a competitive season instead of the watered down bubble? 8-1 in two years
Lakers are about to hang a "we didn’t get swept this time" banner 😂
Paul Pierce is an important addition to this show  (This comment cooked)
LeBron play better than most 25-year-olds lol Spencer does not deserve to be on another team in this league and Darvin ham should be fired immediately. How do you bench Austin Reeves who literally was having a good game
Last night I strained my calf on purpose so I can have a good day today😂😂😂
LeBron Curry and KD out the playoffs, enter the next generation of great players. who cares if the ratings drop, small market teams, rising American stars, and legitimate players will take the stage
Second
Wolves in 6
First
It’s just basketball..
It’s crazy he played 20 seasons and never won a real ring without a superteam. All time great player but can’t put him in the top 10
