5 months later and the buddie pr train of May 2025 still haunts me daily... they played our asses 🖐😞
I cant get enough of this ❤ I NEED PART 2.
Disappointment, disappointment, I watched 911 for 8 years and what's up, as Eddie would say, go to hell.😢
okay i think this must be like. my comfort yt video. i just keep going back to it and enjoy it every single time.  BUZZFEED I NEED MORE CONTENT WITH THOSE TWO !!!!
this video is still crazy as hell
WAIT even Oliver Stark admitted that Eddie and Buck have chemistry. Buddie cannon? Please 🙏😭
Oliver S. and Ryan G. are like a solar eclipse. You wanna look at it, you wanna stare, but staring at the sun is not good. So when I want to lovingly stare I will be sure to wear sunglasses because ya’ll are hot! Love you both ❤ I’m shipping “Buddy” Love Forever 😊 ❤
2:34 full on gasped
please we really need oliver stark doing a puppy interview 🙏
i'll never get over from "we are very couple together"
They're so sick of buddies
Eddie Diaz definitely has a slutty little waist, even HEN called that one out.  And that's why Evan has a crush on him, he's weak for slutty little waists
Still waiting for part 2 lmaooo
INSANE CHEMISTRY
3:38- ice goes on the eye, bud. is from season 5 episode 4, home and away, after chims visit with buck (AKA punching buck) Im not that much of a nerd i swear ive just watched the scene and it reminded me of this video, thank you for listening to my TED talk.
Every few weeks I come back to this video and It makes me giggle every time
I fell bad for Ryan I fell like the tweets were all for Oliver
Hi, I’m from Brazil and I really admire you guys — I love you and 911! ❤️
Oi sou do Brasil e admiro muito vocês amo vocês e a série 9-1-1
New to the fandom and I am *CRAZY* about the fact that easily flustered Buck is played by superconfident Oliver and uberchill Eddie is played by 'I am DYING of embarassment' Ryan lol. It must be Oliver being a European and less prudish because the guy keeps his cool and teasing in every situation OMG
9seasons and I was today’s years old when I found out Buckley was English!!!!!! Wtf
These were so tame 😂😂😂
9-1-1 is finally BACK with s9 🔥 and so i'm ALSO BACK here rewatching this gem of a video for the zillionth time :D
I can’t believe they read tweets that talk about choking out, as if that is something that’s OK. That is such a sick fetish.
WOOF WOOF?????
once again here...waiting for part 2 for when buddie goes canon🙏🏼
now with the new season coming up will we finally get the oliver stark puppy interview? i really need that!
I watch it every day and im still endeared Ryan is blushing every time he reads a tweet
I’m in a public setting trying my absolute hardest to hold in my giggles and not look absolutely psycho 😭😭😭
I'm back here again!
here i am. once again. feeling VERY EXCITED CAUSE THESE TWO ARE COMING BACK TO OUR SCREENS IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS !!! S9 9-1-1 LET'S GO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need part 2 with more Ryan blushing please
That was very gentle Ryan is so hot he deserved some more
4:55 PERSON is killing me
😍😍😍😍😍
I hate these videos, they’re taking our insane people spaces away from us! If I want to say some horrendously down-bad things about my favorite actors/characters without worrying about them finding it, that is my right!!
WHERE IS PART 2
been thinking about this video again these last couple of days (partly because yeah and partly bc of the s9 behind-the-scenes content we've gotten) so i just had to come here and do it again
help- Ryan's cheeks are red and Oliver's face are red
Ryan said "ice goes on eye bud" when Ryan and Oliver are on the balcony and Oliver (as buck) had a black eye
This video changed the trajectory of my life
The way they each read so many of the tweets about the other one
Friendly reminder that Ryan Guzman gave us the GOODS in his movie with J.Lo The Boy Next Door in 2015. He's used to us thirsting after him.
2:12 The way Ryan stares at him after Oliver says "we obviously get on" in reference to Buck and Eddie....do they know something we don't? Did Oliver indirectly spoil something??
I'm still convinced eddie and buck should have been a couple
OLIVER IS BRITISH?
I love Oliver accent just kills me every time especially here when he says Ryan’s name so sexy
Still waiting for the puppies interview 😭😭😭💗💗💗💗
So y'all telling mee there's not a single Wattpad stories of them??
I'm kinda mad at these two.  Knowing people wanted to see them together on the show and even there writers built up to it... yet they kept teasing us the entire show run instead of following through with their story.  Just leaves a bad taste to the show.  Kinda feels like they queer baited for views.  I blame both the actors and writers for it honestly.
it's been a couple weeks, had to watch this AGAIN
THIS WAS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER WITNESSED! MY BABYGIRL AND BIGBOI JUST LAUGHING THE HOT ASS' OFF I CAN'T ASK FOR MORE!
They have even more bromance outside the studio
Thay need to get together in the show please like look at the way they look at each other
Oliver シリーズ1の紅顔の美青年はふくよかなおじさんて感じ、アングロサクソンてこんなに老けるの早いの‼️( ﾟдﾟ)ﾊｯ!誰かが言ってた彼らはミルクだと、絶句します、
Love them 😭🙏
these guys are better than Paul and Ian😁😁
Waiting for them to realize ryan was in the step it up movie series 😂
here again for my dose, don't mind me
we really need that oliver stark puppy interview pleaseeeeee
but lbh buck/ oliver being such a golden retriever is soooooo accurate!
We need a part 2!!!! Please!!!!!! What do we have to do?
Ok, listen, i would never ship actors in real life.... but come on. What the hell was that comment by Oliver about ryan' slutty waist. So u looked at him and u liked it. U know what, if they don't give us buddie than I ship Ryan and oliver at this point ahahaha😂
this particular video has always been popping up in my play next yt recommendation.. and i keep watching it every time 💀💔
We need a puppy interview
Buzzfeed, I will sacrifice my life for you lot to do a pt.2
We absolutely need a part two! Please?! Pretty please?!
Sweet baby boy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉❤❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤❤🎉
''you got a little thing going on''
i've started to recite parts of this video at random that's where i am
I always forget that this is Oliver his real accent 🥵
I always forget that Oliver is not an American😭🙏🏻
It's a tie between Peter Krause Ryan Guzman and Oliver Stark being the most attractive guys in the world you mean 😂
BUCK HAS AN ACCENT???
not me just smiling through the end lol
oliver stark is not acting as buck bc he IS buck himself
FREE ME
'ice goes on the eyes bud' DUDE I REMEMBER THAT!  HOW COULD YOU NOT?! Also, I agree with op. Feels like I heard a metaphorical 'ping' in my head when he said that.
5:34 "now read the tweet"... my god oliver! you flirt!
The way Ryan blushed when it said “I want to be choked by Oliver Stark’s thighs” boy has a crush 😂😂
This is so funny lmao
Ig I'm just wondering how yall pick the tweets. Do you have categories of thirsty or something?
came here AGAIN after watching the Brad Bitt and Javier Bardem edition lol
Ryan was blushing hard when they read about "Oliver's thighs" lol
They get paid to read I guess.
Both hottie men ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🌈🏳️‍🌈
I need this with Rafa and Ronen. 🤞🏻
5:23 LMAOO THIS ENTIRE PART HAS ME DEAD
The most beautiful man on earth ❤ buck and eddie ❤
OLIVER SPINELESS COWARD MISHA 2.0, RYAN HOMOPHOBIC JANSEN 2.0, 911 QUEERBAITING TIM MINEAR TALENTLESS HACK SHOULD BE FIRED
💀💀😂😂😂
Coming back here 1 month later
It’s blasphemous how YouTube hide this video from me for a month 😤😤😤
where is the puppy interview buzzfeed GIVE IT TO US
Why y'all haven't done Bill Skarsgård is beyond me🙏🏽🙏🏽
8:09 Oliver Stark, ah NOPE-
New subscriber🎉
WHY DO I KEEP WATCHING THIS
I just want to complain, why the hell is the waist part 3 hours long
8:18  i am the only one that want to know what the tweet said ?
3:42 i just go to look after it cause i was curios . the fact that the line was told to buck is....something else🥹
you two are so sexy and so funny, you would be a great comedy duo 😂
Confident Eddie- shy Ryan Shy buck- confident Oliver
2:35 😊😊😊🥰🥰🥰
Two Finest Men 😊❤😊😊❤😊❤
The day this boat starts sailing the internet will be happy they have drugged this so much
Who are these people
When you saw that Eddie and Tommy had a date to play basketball!👍
How many times have I watched this? Yes. 😂
Lol, these tweets are mild.... There are more tweets rough and like other episodes where we get those from other celebs... So we need more of the rough ones
My goodness. Can they just kiss already?
I’m on the verge of losing my voice and isn’t supposed to talk or make a sound but I can’t stop laughing
I feel for them. Always exploited smh
I have such a massive crush on Oliver Stark.
I need Billie Eilish on here. I feel genuinely curious. 😭
7:53 AAAANNDDD CLIPPED 😂
2:09 We are very coupled together, and listen... the characters there's definitely a chemistry. We obviously Get oN! NeXT quEstion!    WAIT- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY OLIVER? GET ON? THAT'S A SIGN MY PEOPLE!  It's like he said something that he shouldn't have said (like a spoiler.) and cleared his throat while making that awkward blushing grin! While ryan laughing hard watching his dumb-ass performance to cover up the fact he spit out the spoiler! 😂😂😂😂😂
Just flirting right in front of our salad
So positive, friendly guy-guy interactions are seen as flirting now? Y’all are strange.
This was hot. They are so hot.
i’m here Again.
Get these two together asap
8:36 ryan's face is so red. i can't 😂😂
IF THEY DON'T KISS IN THE NEXT SEASONS OR EPISODES, I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO CRAZY
And women complain about men sexualising???? Y’all do the same shit 😂
I petition to have Stray Kids’ Bang Chan on next 🙋🏾‍♀️🤭
I had no clue Ryan was British
one day this video will hit 1 billion views and half of it will be all mine. thank you buzzfeed, i can't thank you enough
oliver stark and Ryan guzman puppy interview next!!!!
Please do Metallica!!!!
its not even thirst tweets
05:34 holy shit 😭😭 the flirting is craaazy
I love the show 911 and I don’t watch any media on it really, just the show. And this popped up today. And I’m SOO GLAD that I’m not the only person who thought there was chemistry between these two characters SINCE THE BEGINNING ( well since they actually began being friends in the show )
OMGGG WHAT
I didn't know they were like this irl too, it's so heartwarming that they seem close and chill as actors too! They seem so comfortable with each other, they just kept flirting the entire time lmao
Hats off to Stark and Guzman for not reading the trash.
These guys are laughing their asses off because these are the show viewers who are helping pay the bills. No viewers, no show, so literal YES men. Viewers don't get too crazy with the comments. Their wives will see this.
What is this Girl shit??? It kills the man vibe.
I wish I had a little thing going on because I've been too lazy and am turning into a Hershey Kiss.
Guys being able to take thirsty compliments is very wholesome 😊
It’s so weird seeing buck not speaking like buck, does that make sense? 🤔
I am alarmed at how many times I have watched this video. Like literally five times a day since it came out.
They are so hot <3
Ive been watching this video for like 2 weeks now and doesn't end... it is supposed to be this long?
this is like my 10th time here. this make me happy and we need more
Sorry the way that Oliver was cringing and Ryan was awkwardly laughing was so funny  I was literally laughing through the ENTIRE VIDEO 😂😂
I forgot that Oliver is British
The one where it said they think about Ryan Guzman’s butt cheering them up made me laugh so hard
08:50 oh hunny, the Buddie shippers wanna see you ran through alright 😂😂😂
It is a pleasure for me to repeat this every day ;) EVERY DAY
Ahora una entrevista con perritos, porfavor!!, necesitamos más de Ryan y Oliver
It was a great shame when Evan "Buck" Buckley was turned into a bisexual
I watch this video daily it's honestly concerning
Ryan Guzman has definitely let a gay or two go down on him. 💯
I demand a puppy interview with them
More of this please
Guzman face is fat now compared to his Step Up days
I cant stop rewatching it #buddie
I Love these guy's 😂😂
I’m here again😂
Not to be that person, but I watch this video a lot and the spelling in the time stamp  titles “sexy soot” is spelled wrong as “sut” and it’s driving me crazy.
i'm still here, hi
I love these two gents! ❤❤
i'm living here now.
This might be the best buzzfeed video I’ve ever watched😂😂😂 I just died🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
8:06 the fact oliver had to clarify not from me, I'm dead 💀💀
These two guys hot. I wish there could be like a rain scene with them both stranded on a cave while skin to skin making eachother feel warm
Maybe invite Chris Evans in Thirst Tweets next time?..
Oliver acting like the B on his shirt isn't for "Babygirl", sir even your wardrobe agrees lmao
Buzzfeed what do we have to do to get a part 2 🙏
Their low tolerance to the mild spicy ones shocked me lol.
I need part 2 plis
I watch this video at least three times a day
I know y'all don't usually do part two but I'm on my knees 😭
I did not know about this episode 😂 I love them😂
BUDDIE BUDDIE
😂😂
IM SORRY HES BRITISH???!!!?!?!? WHATTTT
If this interview wasn’t a huge pr stunt to queer bait 911 fans and keep people watching after Tim ruined the show it would be really funny
❤❤❤❤❤v❤❤❤❤ love  bug
oliver @3:40: “i assume a medical emergency??” it was buck’s medical emergency💀
Ryan was just dying😂😂😂😂
I’ve never heard a man say contour before and know what it was.
Never heard of him, but you can add me to the "thirst list" 🥵
Love that one is absolutely enjoying every bit of this while the other is so uncomfortable and embarrassed by it all 😂
bring jensen ackles, misha collins and jared padlecki, i'm sure you'll get like 7 videos worth of content
do they know its legal?
I would like to see thirst tweets from other 911 cast members. Maybe one with Lou Ferrigno jr.
THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST ONES!! Their chemistry is incrediblee
every time I remember that awful end of season 8 I came back to rewatch this. thank you buzzfeed for your service
🎀
HAPPY BDAY 😍😍
I discover Ryan Guzman in 911 and the tweet about his body made me look on google and I'm not disappointed about what I saw. He's so HANDSOME ❤
Next puppy interview???  Didn't know oliver had n accent soundsss nice!!
I LOVE HOW THEY'RE BLUSHING OMG CUTIE PIES
okay I love the show guys!! and loved this video too, next time show them tiktok edits about buddie!! that'd be so funny and interesting
These two are out of this world 😂😂😂. Babygirl and hearing Oliver in his British accent 🥵. But they are both so sexy ❤
Where is the puppy interview
Crazy hearing Buck then Oliver. His US accent is so good
Oliver implying having a blood kink at 1:32? 😂😂😂
The amount of times I've watched this is a problem Please send help
i've rewatched this more times than is probably considered normal
I think it's still wholesome tho😂 mildest of them all😂😂
this is like cocomelon for buddie shippers
They’re so handsome & cute blushing 😂 babes this ain’t even the R rated ones
come on buddie. why keep dragging them writers, tim? come on already
Im still here, I can’t leave 🙂
We need a thirst tweet video with Noah Wyle and Shawn Hatosy 🥹
Oliver's British accent, though 🤩🔥
In the words of Cardi B, “If that n**** had a twin, I would let 'em run a train, woo (skrrt)”
They should just kiss already
They way I blushed and giggled and felt like I was interrupting. Just me? Ok byyyyeee
"You’re welcome" 🤣🤣🤣
I hate how everyone is finding out how hot Ryan is i discovered this man through step up😩🥲
i’ve already watched that video at least 20 times and i’m not even exaggerating (it’s getting concerning at that point to be honest) 😭
Oliver's voice is different as british guy
i'm still here.
Not most of these being about their characters instead, I’m HOWLING.
I like that the babygirls are learning about being babygirl
I can’t believe mine was read. It’s the one at 1:55 and I thought I was safe lol
“it’s what thighs do” OLIVER STARK
where is the second part?
why are these grown men flirting with each other like highschoolers and why am i giggling and kicking my feet like hello
Both raw at the same time, next question
8:10 the absolute HEIGHT his voice reached😂
My Destiel-traumatized ass cant take this,, I'm terrified actually
They don't help our delulu mind
BUCK BUCKLEY LMAOOO
These are so fun! I want them to do more!!
I need so much more interviews like this one with this two, it was sooooo funny
We can make this hit million views alongside the part 2 if you drop it now pls @BuzzFeedCeleb
Ryan was in fact NOT ready.
i’ll be watching this on repeat until s9 your honor
This video is like 10 hours long😇😇
The chemistry is off the chain, love them together.
im sat !!
Oliver really releasing his inner chaotic demon on main for this, I'm here for it 😂
they look so good 😭😭
2:35 oliver is like, "man they already ship us enough" 😂
Oliver is so sexy 💋and I love those arms of yours and your accent ❤❤. Ryan is also sexy💋and I love how your always blushing❤❤.You two are both so hot 🔥 🥵. Love you guys 💋💋💋💋
Okay Ryan was flirting with Oliver a bit too much 😂 did he forgot he has to read some tweets about himself
OLIVER STARK HAS A BRITISH ACCENT????? HE'S NOT AMERICAN????? my whole life is a lie
Give. Us. BUDDYYYYY!!!!!!!!
4:02  did he check?????????
Is it getting hot in here or what? Quick someone call 9-1-1 🥵🥵🤓
We got to hold buzzed accountable for how they treat staff
Ryan and Oliver are funny as hell
i’ve never needed something more in my life
they are sooo funny
Eddie blushing the whole time 😂
theyve definitely explored each other's bodies
damn neither of them even said bussy, we gotta bring them back in
watching the whole video with my eyes half closed and my shoulders tense
Get Micheal b. Jordan!
BRITISH??!!
Somebody here called them the "straight Dan and Phil" and I just have to acknowledge that by saying it again 😂
At least Ryan’s self aware now ❤
Oliver stark accent is so fit he should have been allowed to do his normal accent in the show
8:09 😂😂 I thought the “nope” was gonna be a “we can’t read this” but I’m so glad we got to find out. I love Oliver’s laugh ❤
I need more
oliver's reaction to "ran through the gauntlet." he thinks he is so slick 😵‍💫😵‍💫
I need more.
now wait until until buzzed tells them these were the PG ones lmfao
I had no idea Buck had an accent irl… my life has changed
why are they so flirtyyy
How is it that ryan and oliver have more views than a lot of these videos that's been posted a month and more ago? The power of buddie.
now these are what you call HUNKS 🥵
What Show Are They In Together?
AHHHHHHHHHHH
Why is the english begging an American accent
Ryan is honestly the most beautiful man I have ever laid my eyes on
The way I had to keep going back cause I kept laughing and wouldn't understand the next part 😂
This was amazing hahaha love these two so much, I miss them😭
I’ve learned a lot this day
Both guys are so hot!  Oliver's my favorite actor on television today, and he seems like the perfect man!❤
In my head I KNOW Oliver Stark is British, but everytime I hear him talk I still feel surprised.
Ryan Guzman so fineeee ❤
"Alright babygirl" "please don't do that" Oliver knew how crazier Buddie shippers are with audios like that 😂
@BuzzFeed  Angela Bassett when? Either for your kittens thing or this. You need her.
Hahaha the hilarious couple but not romantic couple in series ❤❤❤😂
Part 2 during season 9 plz!
This was hilarious 😂 I love Oliver and Ryan so much 💗
Oliver's English Accent is Beautiful. Who knew he was English? His stock just skyrocketed in my heart.
Now we need the Puppy Interview
im a medium and ryan has a deep secret about his sexuality but ill let him tell the world when he's ready
That’s a nice ass jacket!!! 🔥
These tweets are not thirsty enough 😂
Hearing them both say "babygirl" a bunch has got my brain fried 😂 Also "you got a little thing going onnn" OKAAAYYY 🫦
This was hard to watch. In my opinion these tweets have gone way too far.
Whomever in the writers room decided that "Buck" needed a bestie, they couldn't have selected anyone better than "Eddie"! Their bromance is the best, most fun friendship on the entire show!♥
These two  are the exemple of friendship i want 😍 and definitely oliver voice is so sexy 😏😏😍😍😍
IM LAUGHING SO DAMN HARD IM DECAYING LMAO
Their both handsome 😍😍
2:54 IN SYNC
This was the best video I've watched on Youtube or any other platform in years! I couldn't stop smiling! I love Oliver and Ryan! This video should tide me over until I can get my next fix of Buddie next season ❤
Fact= Oliver WOULD TOPPED Eddie. Audience= chairs and applause 😊
I love how all of Oliver’s tweets are about how he’s super pretty and baby girl, then Ryan’s is a bunch of people calling him slutty and how his body is hot 😂😂
eating up this queer-bait like the 4-course meal it is
hm, I don't know, guys. They seem to have such great chemistry. Maybe they should be a couple, start dating or something
Even Oliver himself says he's obsessed with Ryan s butt and Ryan knows Oliver could top him so he starts laughing and embarrassed. He knows he's button for Oliver 😊😊😊
1:03 Oliver going off in the background trying to be all modest and shit and Ryan staring us down like he knows lmaooo
Ryan: Oliver Stark- *Blushes terribly and becomes a tomato*  PD: I LOVE RYAN AND HIS 50 SHADES OF PINK
"Is that the consent you have been wanting for? Not form me-" QLDKWKNDMW Oliver stop making me fantasies pleaseeeee
"I mean it would stand up nice coming from you" ALKDKQNDKSDN he wants to feed us with buddie so bad. Meanwhile Ryan is laughing his ass off
I NEED THE PUPPY INTERVIEW 👹👹👹👹👹👹
I'm sorry but eddie with mustache was traumatizing 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I agree with  the girl that says that  oliver stark being too hot for this world. I'm sure I'm 99% lesbian cuz 1% of me doubts when i see Oliver Stark (he's is so fine 🫠)
The reaction of Oliver stark in each tweet is hilarious 😂😂😂
WHAT--- I'm speechless, he called him baby girl KALXNAKNDSND  😂😂😂 (this is gonna give so many fanfics production)
IT'S TRUEEEEE, they do have one of the best chemistry I have ever seen 😂😂😂
ok this is the best thing that has ever happened
The look on Ryan like ;-; people he DEFINITELY knows he is handsome 😅
You got a little thing going on~~😏 LAKFKSNFNSND OLIVER YOU ARE HILARIOUS
You got a little thing going on~~😏 LAKFKSNFNSND OLIVER YOU ARE HILARIOUS
The wolf wolf of Oliver Stark is so cute (he learned it and he doesn't let it go KADNAKNFSNN) PD: I love you Oliver Stark 🫶
I'm not nervous, I'm trembling
THE INTRO MAKE ME CHOKE-
@BuzzFeedCeleb I hope you know how much of a balm this video is for disappointed buddies this week. Choosing to believe this was the s8 finale, amen 🙏
That last one damn near made Ryan die of secondhand embarrassment! LOL! I love these guys... and these were pretty tame comments - Ryan wouldn't survive the spicy stuff! 🤣
They literally make me homophobic; electric chair
wow, their tone of their accent is so bold! love it!
Agradecida de ver esto!!!!! gracias muchas gracias por estooooo, los amo, mas porfavor xd
I laughed so hard my cheeks hurt. 😂😂😂 Definitely saving this for when I need a good laugh, a mood boost, or a “drool over self” moment. 😆😂🤤
8:09 Oliver's anticipatory expression is sending me - he clearly read ahead 🤣
'I've just got to show up and turn around' - that kills me!!!!!
I cant believe this im going crazy
WHERES PART TWO PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUHHH
my cheeks hurt from smiling for 9min and 23sec.. thanks buzzfeed
oh buddie my beloved 🥺💗💗💗
SOOOOOOOOOOO when does the puppies video drop ?! 🧐😛😛
this is my all time favorite video now thanks 😭❤❤❤❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
u have cured all my mental illnesses buzzfeed
the fandom is too respectful and cutesy ahahha proud
BUDDIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
OMG.. Ryan asking 'my waist is slutty?' In a very sexy voice 🥵
Do they know that there are more comments that are about them 'together'?
I am the only one flabbergasted by his accent where in the entire hell was he hiding that
these are so mild cos ive seen worse lmaooo
this is my buddie canon
oh buzzfeed knows what the people want 🤭
Why do I feel like I'm interrupting something 🤨
Thank you for posting this today so I could take a break from sobbing over my dead father on his birthday and laugh instead
Buck ranting about Eddie’s fridge calendar was 7x04, the episode Buck realized he likes men. 😂
This is what we want from buck and Eddie 😂😂😂😂
"how do you feel?" "like Ive been ran throu-" HUH
Ryan and Oliver reading thirst tweets about oliver
These tweets are so tame compared to others that have been on here
truly their chemistry is wild,, i need more videos of them just bantering lol
This thumbnail is criminal
What show is this?
How did I not know Oliver was english
Ah so this was just textbook queerbaiting
Who else keeps coming back here to feel better after that season finale😔
Coming back here after the finale and seeing all of these buddie tweets feels so….   Ps: im fine w part 2, bring it to us
Buzzfeed fell off, these interviews used to be fun.  They did NOT include one single thirst tweet, the tweets they choosed were boring and not thirsty at all… like bring us old good buzzfeed thirst tweets WHAT HAPPENED?
Ryan is so shy, its cute
"Alright babygirl" LORD HAVE MERCY
HELP I CAME BACK TO THISS
Oliver would look SOOOOOOOOOOOOO sexy with an eyebrow piercing on the side with his birthmark 🥵
The best bromance
I need them in a puppy interview too. And get Kenneth Choi to read thirst tweets too
I love it when these videos are this long. The tweets were absolutely hilarious. These two just have a chemistry I cannot explain!
Lol it's not even thirsty
"they're best friends" have you no eyes,, did you not see that?
I would hire Oliver Stark to reply to the thirst messages I get, he’s so chill about them 😄
The last comment was it.😂❤
😂😭 0:40
wow these might be the tamest 'thirst tweets' I've ever seen. Boring
ok so now i NEEEEEEED an oliver stark puppy interview like pronto
oliver’s lowkey a freak he was enjoying that a bit too much lol
Every time I watch this Thirst Tweets video I feel like the poor guy would go and take a hot shower and rip a layer of his skin with a loofah. 😂😂😂😂
Loved the final and you guys were great ❤️
what happened Oliver's eye
I need more tweets about Ryan, especially his breathtaking visual🤤🤤🤤
They are sexy
Their friendship is everything!!! They are hilarious, but come on these were tame. We needed some extra spicy ones… then again, Ryan might have died from laughing 😂
The whole video I keep laughing thinking about how my friend was screaming in my DMs because half of these tweets are their mutuals’ 😭
They're both looking kinda chubby.
7:22 nah bro they rly wanted oliver to pull and tom keen- /j (iykyk-
this video has only been out a day and i’ve already watched it 10x and showed it to everyone i love omfg
Hello, Humans😀🖐 Tough humans don't waste their time trying to prove. Only the weak try to stick their chest out all the time.  TERRANCE OUT
“We are just … the most coupled UNCOUPLE” is a very underrated statement 🤣🙌🏾
I didn't think of searching for Ryan Guzman's butt until now. 😮😅😂
diazzzzz🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🚒
The way this is better than the season finale
did abc purposefully make oliver the 9-1-1 spokesperson because they wanted a human shield to avoid criticism of that godawful finale? he's just an actor, the real problem is abc and the showrunners.
these barely scratches the surface. these are not even thirst tweets, just random vanilla tweets. i've read some that are much nastier 😭
I’m so dead rn😭
This better be foreshadowing for Buddie cuz with that ending of season 8 y’all owe us big time 😤
lmao @ Oliver pretending to be humble @ 1:06 and Ryan clocking his tea at 1:15
the fact that this isn’t even the worst of it 😭
they was flirting all video <3 i love it
3:40 when Chim punched Buck in the eyeball in Season 4 for knowing about Maddie when he didnt
I feel like reading this kind of stuff with your best friend about one another could easily enter awkward territory so I’m glad to see the boys having so much fun with it
so buzzfeed when are you dropping the uncut and bts footage of this ???
"you got a little thing going on" 😅😅
Ryan: Oliver Stark UH NOPE... so fricken cute, all red in the face.  How he's so hot and so tame and embarrassed.  I love how Oliver is LOVING Ryans discomfort too lol.
The fact that even under what I assume is camera makeup, you can see how red they are getting in embarrassment is adorable
This is the best thing in the world because their chemistry is truly unmatched. Thanks, BuzzFeed, here's hoping for a second part!
Thank you buzzfeed
Did he just say ‘that’s what they’re for’”? 😂 daaaaamnnnnn 😏
why is ryan so red ggfsdgsdhsdfghgsdfgdhj
2:33 ryan saying "alright baby girl" will replay in my head on dark nights
For what length of time can you hold your breath?  Excuse me, sir. 😛😛😛
The way the chemistry one perfectly summed up this video: like those thirst tweets were just in the background & all you can see is CHEMISTRY like wow
I have no idea who tf they are, sorry to these men. But my god, they are beautiful. 🤤🫦
Ryan’s awkward laugh when his and Oliver’s chemistry is mentioned. He is uncomfortable
how long can you hold your breath??! excuse me SIR 😛😛😛
6:27 OLIVER STARK YOU ARE A BIG BOY NOW HAVE YOUR WAY WITH ME 😍
1:33 F K OLIVER/BUCK IS SO HOT 🤤
They're so cute.
Seeing their interviews makes me more convinced Buddie is real. Because Ryan and Oliver do not look at each other with heart eyes the way Eddie and Buck do.
No, Ryan! DO NOT STOP DOING SQUATS SJDJFKFJEUDB
stop this means everything to us 🤭
this was my s8 finale
My cheeks hurt so bad from laughing anf smiling, I love them sm and their characters ugh
is this what it's like to ascend
8:30 too real
Aye 😂😂😂😂 when I see a good butt it’s either Oliver’s or Ryan’s
The fuq
Gonna be watching this over and over again over the shitty finale we got 🥴
Oh they fucking frfr
Puppy interview next!!!
Even out of character they look good together😂
I cried that whole time 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I need more of this to help from the disappointment that was that season finale lol
I need another 3 hours of them doing this omg
Oliver living his best life while Ryan keeps gets redder by the minute lmao.
i need to see them with puppieeeees
Surprisingly wholesome.  8:55
Uh, Nope, Nope!
maybe next season we will see  Ryans butt and Olivers arms get together and put out each others fire !
this just added 20 years to my life span
"Woof woof" ---> NO 😂
"Oliver Stark....NOPE!" 🤣
Lol
Did Joyce interview them? We need that asap if she did ❤
the "ice goes on the eye, bud" is from when chimney punched buck in the eye and left a black eye. Buck had the ice down and then Eddie told him to put it on his eye
Everyone say thank you buzzfeed ❤
They got a go into the TikTok comments
😂😂😂😂😂
ALRIGT NOW WE NEED PART 2
We need more of them ❤❤❤
loved this and I can't get over how they reacted to these tweets. They would get heart attack if they got to read the Buddie fanfics. (even though I think they already know)
oh they've definitely explored each other's bodies
the way these were all relatively tame too 😭
How much do you think Oliver weighs?
I Love You Guys!!!! I would love to meet both of you, and give both of you a kiss 💋💋....... You Guys are so Hot!!!! 😍🔥😍🔥
The thumbnail... THATS OOMF IN LAW???
All these tweets are from thirsty gay men.😂
These arent even the worse tweets i see oomfs on here too
Why are they flirting
OH MY GOD OLIVER ON THE THUMBNAIL IM GOING FERAL
Oliver Stark's extra handsome and cute here 😍
You did more for us than the show did, thank u
I love them❤😊
OLIVER STARK IS BRITISH!? Sorry, I’ve just never seen any interviews, so he’s always been Buck in my mind.
We need to have a
Can I just this: I love that they don’t make the fans that ship Buck x Eddie feel crazy. There are TONS of actors who dismiss fans of LGBTQ+ ships, these two don’t.
Now release the uncut version. Please? 🥺
I love them both so much 😂😂 Oliver saying babygirl made my entire day
ABSOLUTELY LOOOOVE this!  Thanku!
WOOF WOOF 😂😅
It's strange seeing Oliver and Ryan read their "Couple" Thirst tweets together like this. It's not that I am not enjoying it because I am, a lot! The two of them are so funny, and I love their on and off screen chemistry and friendship! But usually you see this type of fanservice in the Aisan BL industry, so seeing such service here, on a popular Western media platform, is different but fun! I'm here for it! 🤭🥰
Love these 2. Love 911❤
Hey Buzzfeed. Do Thunderbolts* thirst tweets next
i need more ryan/eddie tweets :(
“woof woof- no” HSHWHSHHSHS
These are so tame. I literally intrusively last night watching the season finale said I want to bite his neck when Ryan Guzman was on the screen. I didn’t even think about the words that came out of my mouth.
BUZZFEED PUPPY INTERVIEW NEXT? YES PLEASE
I SCREAMED
8:38 Ryan is literally firetruck red
My fav Duo making my day x
i don't even watch 911 bu i had to see a thirst tweets video  i'll always laugh at the babygirl reactions
this is my buddie canon.
Anyone else’s mind blown cause they didn’t know Buck was British?! 🤯
🤤👌
*they would look so good as a couple on the show* 😭
So much flirting...
Is it me ryan is having a crush on Ollie and he dont know what to do with that crush...
Coupled uncoupled plus a child...
I just saw the comment on an interview video yesterday about them reading thirst tween on BuzzFeed and there it is.😂
THIS is how I learn Oliver Stark is British?!?! 🥵
foaming at the mouth
i genuinely thought they we’re gonna torture these two and have them read not-so-god honoring buddie tweets😭😭😭
6:53 so puppy interview with oliver stark when??
There were only a couple on there that were actually thirst tweets. Like that’s so tamed compared to what’s actually out there.
3:13 big what Ryan (omg he said buddie)
Love them together soo much!!! They're too funny 😭
I wish they had more explicit ones but at least one was read.
We need a 2nd part plus bring puppies in
... who's going to tell them they were just flirting with each other this whole episode? 🤣 I've never seen Ryan so red before 🤭And the way he was so shy to read the last tweet and Oliver being so confident with it was just chef's kiss 🤣
i placed this brick 7 years ago... let's go? LET'S MF-ING GOOOO
This could have been the puppy interview
nahhhh, they know what they’re doing and im here for it
Coming here again and again to have a laugh whenever my mood is down  These two are so unhinged here lol Love them sm ❤️  Cmon buzzfeed we can have another part or a puppy interview with them…
when a 10 minute buzzfeed video is more watchable than the entire 8th season.
8:11 was the best 😂😂
I said yesterday that they should read Thirst Tweets and here we are 🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂 Ryan was blushing a LOT 🫢🥰🤣😂🥹
Couple that we failed to protect 💔
Dear cast & writers of “9-1-1 “  Give the girls & gays what they want 🙏🏽 please and thank you-Management
They Look like they have Been Fed ...
08:14 Oliver Stark, ah NOPE
Depression? Cured!
all i needed
Woof woof👀 iykyk
here after 8x18😂😂
Oliver’s true accent just adds to it
The fact that there is constant blushing throughout this video
yess o stark and rg!!! I have been waiting for thissss!!
love it
Who r these men and where can i buy one xxxxx
Love this two🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
that was HILARIOUS
The roles have switched😂 Buck is mad confident while eddie is a blushing mess 😂😂. THANK YOU BUZZFEED. You have made my entire year with this video
god i love them😭😭😭
They're so beautiful and they're glowing and there's me die laughing as they progress on reacting to the tweets 😹😹😹
Woof woof no
OH MY GOD BLESS YOU BUZZFEED
Oliver stark puppy interview when???!!
They did it again.   No Buddie union.
WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED LMAO. Ugh they're so fkn cute 🥹
OH HOW IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
3:09 "big **ck" "big WHAT?" "Big Buck!" 😂😂😂
Oh c’mon buzz feed, stop being soooo lame. Bring them back and give em the GOOD tweets!!!
Ryan will never let Buddie happen I don’t think he feels comfortable going there 😅😅😅
4:07 how does the saying go? “hate to see you go but love to see u walk away”??? 😂😂😂
I didn’t know I needed this until now 😂 i love these two so bad. I will be watching this 10x a day. They’re so silly
9:23 i literally spun on my work  chair listening Oliver say that's what his thighs are for 🥵
These used to be much ….. more adult
WHAT- OMG!!! not them reading the thirst tweets TOGETHER AHHHH <3 LOVE IT
Yes! They need a puppy interview!!
Like I understand Oliver is British but every time it takes me for a loop 😂😂❤
me giggling and kicking my feet through this whole video
Why is this 2 hrs long 😃
I just love how their self esteem went up, bro they're flattered ❤❤
Mind you these are the tame ones 😭😭
Is anyone else thinking of Buck and Eddie watching this 😂
just what i needed my two favorite people 💜💜💜
PUPPIES AND PART 2 PLEASE
I hope Oliver do a interview with him playing with puppies ❤️. Love them together
Buck has a praise kink and size complex kink confirmed
we demand a part 2 with puppies
Ryan: Alright babygirl Oli: Please don't do that Hundreds of Buck feminization fic authors drowning in flame
i’m so dizzy it’s so hot in here
"Alright, baby girl." I'M DOWN ON MY KNEES
Am laughing so much in this
BRO I've been waiting for this.🎉
These were actually so tame lol
The way I love these two men so much and they don’t even know I exist🥹
This whole time I thought it was Guzzzz- man. Not gooze- mon
This needed to be LONGER
Buzzfeed whats going on? where are the thirst tweets? These are tame as hell. Im gonna take back my like LOL
Jesus loves you
We need more pls
1:56 THISSS. Never watched 9-1-1 a day in my life but I’m now HOOKED on this ship after seeing like 5 clips. The love and tension I feel when they’re on screen together is so strong it already appears like they’re married! Missing out on this opportunity would be abc’s biggest fumble
Omg they are so hot 😍😍
When will Peter Krause thirst tweets happen??
i personally would be humiliated if i implicated myself in the most egregious display of queerbaiting in the history of television but i guess everyone involved in this is a soulless ghoul
this has been long overdue. Can't believe it took us 10 years to get this thirst tweet with them
they went so easy on them bless their hearts
Seems a tad queerbaity considering that disappointing season finale.
I don’t think Oliver has  imperfections
ALL THIS FOR THAT EPISODE? I’m throwing a brick at Tim minear
BUDDIE S9 IKTR
IF SHIP NOT CANON WHY ACTORS DROPPING HINTS?!?!!18;919/‘sowoqoeueh
Oliver puppy interview happening?
8:39 Not the "You're welcome🙂"
Legend has Ryan is still blushing
Ryan always have a hard time hiding his red face in everything, his previous movies, in the series and his previous interviews XD   Must have been hard having the automatic tomato facer XD
Oliver Stark can top me too.
Ryan just said "alright Baby girl" to Oliver and I'm on the floor🙇
It feels like they saved the best for the last when reacting to the last comment that way. Oh, don't get me wrong. In fact, Ryan gave the most contagious laugh of all, and this just makes me unable to keep a straight face anymore. Surely, it means both did enjoy themselves to the full, which is a "jaw-droppingly stunning" fact, I guess 😄
This should be an hour long video😂😂
noooooo, Oliver is slowly losing his accent
2:34 IM DYINGGGGGG
"It means you got a little thing going on." *hourglass motion* "I got a little thing going on?"  LMAOOOOO one is hip and the other isn't.
THANK YOU BUZZFEED! I MEAN THAAAAAANK YOUUUUUU
We need these two doing these on a weekly basis
Not the queerbaiting again 😶
8:09 just this whole sequence.
i am SO glad these two made up lmao
ONLY 9 MINUTES?!?! I NEED MOREEEEEEE
7:19 "It would've sounded nice coming from you" ?!?!!!?!!??!!??!!!
I cannot wait for people to edit this video and put subtitles on every movement, eye contact, reaction, etc... 👀
Después de ver el peor final para una temporada, necesito volver a ver este video y olvidar lo que sea que fue el final de la S8 de 911
also, this is soft, I read waaaaaaaay worse (Mikko I saw that)
this is my new favorite video (I already watched it 3 times)
😂😂😂❤
I did not know he was british. was not expecting that accent.
nvm after watching that season finale...this is my official ryliver AND buddie canon
I'm on my knees for you 🛐🛐🛐🛐
We need these two so many more times! This made me so happy!
Now they just happen to be one of the most influential ships that have sailed in recent times.
I’d be terrified if I was them to read thirst tweets lol
Ryan, Oliver, you're not beating the allegations...the alleGAYtions
These poor fools, they would probably combust if they just only read some of the actual thirst tweets. That last one was just starting to be bad, whoever picked these out had mercy on them lmao
rewatching this cuz the finale aint it….911 sure likes to waste potential!!
How does he not remember the fridge calendar? Bball with Tommy was CIRCLED
IM BLUSHING SO HARD OML
QUEERBAITING AT ITS FINEST
I don't even know who they are/what they're from. Why am I here? 🥲
So… when is Oliver’s puppies interview??
is this the PG version before the good one comes out? lol
My faves!!!
Okay Buzzfeed you are riding buddie ship too
Please get Norman Reedus and Jeffery Dean Morgan to do this together.
WE NEED MOREEE
THEY ARE BLUSHINN😭😭
RYAN IS SO REDD
Oh god this soooo funny 😂 I loved them
We need part. This is not the whole thing tho 😭😭😭😭😭
"they love me anyway" unlike Buck's parents LMAO
i miss the stache everyday
Oliver took these like a champ! Ryan… tried his best 😂❤
I’ve seen worst thirst tweets 😭
them saving the good ones for the end lmaoaoaoao
We could’ve had a Peter Krause puppy interview……
They are so hilarious I love them 😭❤
Eddie (Ryan) calling buck (Oliver) baby girl FULFILLS the fan fics. Authors are shaking in their boots 🤣
These are so mild 🙃
release the oliver stark puppy interview
Omg i love it so much
So i need a part 2 with the real filth followed by a puppy interview
This was really funny, the queer bating is so annoying though, I doubt that couple will ever happen on 9-1-1...
Ryan avoiding the digital footprint of him reading unhinged tweets about oliver on camera is so funny lmao
Giggling like a little girl at work rn
SAT!!
I love you guys u guys are some hotties
I love you buck
ohmygod ryan almost read the last one hahahaha Ry i'm so sorry but the blushing is adorable hahaha
Haven't watched a single second & I already know I'm about to feel REALLY uncomfortable!😂 The Internet has ZERO chill!🤦🏾‍♀️🤣 Here we go.......🤤🙈🔥  Update: Sooooooo BuzzFeed picked out the tamest tweets yeah? I know how the Internet works & this was FAR cleaner than I know is out there!🤣
THEY LOOK SO PRETTY OMGGGGG
I have been waiting for this video!!!!!
SCHWING! 😍
Not Ryan calling Oliver babygirl ahh and all the buddie references in this!!!! Now I'm pretty confident we'll get buddie canon :D
🫶🏻🤟🏻🖤
Oliver saying “thoughts” after reading buddie tweets. BUDDIE CANON IS COMING
Oliver is just flirting with Ryan the whole time 😂
How do you feel? Like I’ve been ran through. I’m sure he said more but “ran through” was really all I needed
This is me and my friend when we are together with  only phones.
there's no one wishing to impregnate buck/oliver this is so tame
Great now all our heart rates are elevated 🤣🥵🔥❤
now make them read actual thirst tweets.
wow. i literally couldn’t and didn’t stop smiling/laughing this whole video
I dropped off watching 911 awhile ago, maybe i need to go back. Btw, oliver reminds me of brian littrell.
1:19 They are actually hotter than hell 🔥
This video was so good im actually using the comment section for once lmao
Ryan is so giggly and Oliver so overly confident. I am HERE for it!
THESE AREN'T EVEN THAT BAD THERE'S SOME REAAL THIRST ABOUT RYAN/EDDIE IN TWT
i am never going to be the same after this
I hate my mind but Oliver going “you started you don’t know how to finish?” with that tweet was such bad but comedic timing
literally the best thing buzzfeed has ever done 😂
I love these two so much 😭 This makes me so happy
These were not the most thirsty ones but yeahhh😂❤
I'm gonna come here everyday only to watch these beautiful boys 🤭
"You sure you didn't wanna read that one?" was already taking me out and then "That's what they're for." O L I V E R
We absolutely neeeeeeeeed more of this
" "I want to be choked by Oliver Stark's thighs' You sure you don't wanna read that one?" OLIVER
A Brazilian was here 🇧🇷
The video we all needed
the things we put these poor men through... (this was so good omg i need more)
thank god it's tame tweets... my girls ❤
B4L
Yesss❤❤😍
Ryan guzman was in step up 4? Right?
"Just got show up, and turn around." "That's where you do your best work" LMFAO
Love their chemistry!! 💕💕
I’ve been waiting for this day my whole LIFE!!!!! I forgot about Oliver’s accent. I’m dead now. 🤤🤤🤤
These are the tamest thirst tweets buzzfeed has ever had people read
Now I need that puppy interview
this is now my go to youtube video whenever i eat thank you buzzfeed
He is definitely a golden retriever material ❤
That's all I need. They are officially the best. I love you guys very much, maybe more than Ryan's butt😁
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER. 😂💓
"Alright baby girl❤"
So happy that my tweet wasn't read or my tiktok.
So many opportunities for edits on tiktok with this video like auuuuuugh
PUPPY INTERVIEW NEXT
GOSH, THEY BLUSHING BAD 😭
this is my new favorite video
"Oliver Stark...-nupe!" Got me
I fear i might never recover from (or get over) this video
Your best video ever. Buddie 😍
Ryan's almost like "thank you for taking of me", - my character 😂
i love them both so much
snatched🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
The last one whahahha Ryan can't say it whahahahahahahaha
Not the accidental "love me anyway" slip in
Oliver stark got even hotter a long time ago when I found out he's British
puppies interview and part 2 IT'S A NEED
Funniest is part is that 3:44 is actually how he delivered the line to Buck in the show lol
straight dan & phil
Ryan is giving James Dean here. I cant place it but I'm feeling it
Glad someone told them about babygirl
That last one 😂
"ahem next question 😭" that's the sound of a spoiler NDA baby
2:02 I am not kidding you this how someone and I were described seconds before the person asked me out. "You're so cute together for not being a couple" and bam I had a girlfriend. So...I'm not saying nothing I'm just saying...
The funniest thing about this is that it's sooooo tame and yet they already look like tomatoes
"You got a little thing going on " 😂
Oliver saying, "Ryan Guzman's butt" was the best thing I ever heard 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HELL YEAH THOSE ARE MY BABYGIRLS. Now get Kenneth Choi on here for one of these 😭
A bunda do Ryan ter sido tão citada nesse vídeo me encanta 🍑❤
Buddieee 🔥🔥🥰🥰
WE NEED PART 2
Ryan take it out!!! It hurtsss!!
if Buddie isn’t canon by tonight, it’s ON SIGHT for everyone involved.   yup BuzzFeed. you too.
Can yall do this with Eric and Melissa I wanna see them read their thirst tweets lol 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah this was worth the wait! 😂 I'd say poor Oliver and Ryan but weirdly these we're a lot tamer than some of the ones I've seen 🤣 Also I'm absolutely taking this as a birthday present 😅
I think we need to step up our game cause those are not thirsty enough 😂
I'm not breathing, they are insanely husbands and still dare to be shocked with ppl shipping buddie (and the Ry...).
Ryan looking over and saying "Alright, baby girl" is gonna inspire some Buddie fics if those AO3 authors arent already on it.
I think that would of sounded nuce coming from you- HELLO  that's crazy
Eh thats pretty tame, buzzfeed you hyped it up too much
Woof woof -Oliver Stark
Finally one of these vids i can get behind to! 🤩🤩🤩
insanity 😭
Y’all could’ve done better with the thirst
I feel so sorry that they had to go through that but it was so funny. Oh my God.
So when are the writer just gonna give up and make them a couple or I guess once the views drop they’ll give us what we really want 😅
I need the raw footage 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Lmaooo
Can i say that i ‘ve never watched 911 but i’ve watched so many clips and loved the video even though i’ve never watched the show
Please do a part 2 I know there is worse ones 😅
I feel like this should be a regular thing. Can we please have them come back for every season? 🙏❤️
Watching this video in the bus was not a good idea 💀
Very possibly my favorite thirst tweets of all time lmaooooooo
the puppy interview NEEDS to happen with oliver thooooo
These were TAME! But I’m glad Oliver didn’t read all the things about his nose.
i need another ten minutes of this please and thank you
🥵🥵🥵
OSTAAARKKK ¡!! RYAN GUZMAN!!!! IM GONNA PASS OUT
Ryan acts all flustered and embarassed and then just says "I just gotta show up and turn around"
So this was just part 1 right. Part 2 coming soon??  😊
Ok I’m so ready for round 2 please 😂😂😂😂😂
Is their gonna be a part 2 👀🤭
There should be a puppy interview with Peter Krause, Angela Bassett, Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman, etc. 🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
Puppy video or kitten video please? I want to see these two covered in them. It would be adorable!
The 'woof woof' SENT ME LIKEE LAWDDD 🤣😍 THE LAST TWEET THO. Oliver was waiting for him to finish it 🤣
Oliver Stark and Ryan Guzman are silly. 😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁🎬🎥🎥🎥🎥📺🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒
Oliver Stark, Ryan Guzman, Angela Basseett, Peter Krause, David Boraenaz, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg, Ken Jennings, Vanna White, Mariska Hargitay, Ice T, Tony Goldwyn, and other celebrities should be the next hosts for Saturday Night Live. 📺🚕🚕🚕🚕🚕⛴️⛴️⛴️🗽🎥🎥🎥🎬🎬🎬🎬🌜😄😄😄😄😄😄
Oliver and his british english ❤❤❤
Thank you to our favorite dynamic duo for whoring themselves out to do damage control post bobby death
Living for the buddie press tour since I had to quit watching
7:31 YES.THEY.ARE
this must be a big day for my tumblr mutuals
literally, one of the best things you've EVER done, buzzfeed... and I just love you for it!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Honestly they are fucking WILD for this
oh god it’s here
do they know it's legal
oh my lord these audios will make the best buddie edits one day 🤣
This is the best thing I ever watched
This is the best thing I ever watched
i’m genuinely not even a minute in and i had to pause twice to clutch my chest i cannot slakskka
this is the gayest thing i’ve ever watched and i LOVE IT
These two boys + me = Eiffel Tower.. oooooffff!!
I smiled so much at this video that my split lip that had finally started to heal nicely resplit. Do I care? Not at the moment!!!
Y’all just making up celebrities now
They better get together at the season finale 😊❤❤😊
This flirting is crazy.
I don’t there were supposed to be here
they should’ve read a lot more dirty thirst tweet
I don't even go here (haven't seen a single episode of this show) but I know that buddie must become canon. I need to see them fall in love!
"That's what they're for" EXCUSE ME OLIVER
One of the reasons I love 9-1-1 is you can tell on screen that the cast gets along so well, I love seeing the boys have a good time!
last one 😭
I now need them to react to Buddie scenes because clearly they’re need a refresh if they don’t know “ice goes on the eye bud” is in fact a Buddie scene. They’re hilarious.
i feel like I'm interrupting something here
The ice goes o the eye is from after maddie left and chimney hit buck buck cause he was spiraling
AAAAAH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSS
why did they start blurring the tweet handles
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
“ WOOF WOOF “ WOAH
i love them omg
im just from now one living on this interview FOREVER 😊
I just know ryan was imagining it with the last tweet why he went so red
THE LAST ONE😭😭😭
More please!!! ❤❤❤
are they lovers?
Os dois super vermelhos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What happened to the area around Oliver's left eye? Did he ever explain?
Esses dois são tão maravilhosos kkkkkkkkk Que vídeo perfeito, ri muito!
I cannot stop staring at Oliver’s arms like God damn, I want him to pick me up and throw me to the bed
Did I internally scream when I saw this? Yes, yes I did
They are definitely canon and I was born for it. ❤
Get them a puppy interview NEOW.
I didn't know Oliver Stark had an accent!
Never knew how much I needed this interview until now
these two are the greatest thing since jenmish during the supernatural days (jenmish are still my number 1s tho pls get them on here😭)
Damn this was hilarious, as expected 🤣
longer video please god
Puppies one next please!! Before Oliver disappears into the woods with his dogs 😢😢
i feel like i’m intruding JESUS CHRIST
Just KISS already. 💋
Oliver and Ryan weren’t ready for this one! 😂😂😂😂😂  We need part 2 and Thirst Tweets with Peter Krause next!
Oliver talking about Ryan's waist just like Buck "Of course I check a hot guy's ass, but that's normal"
If that last one was too much mikkos tweet would’ve killed them😭
Lo puedo ver 02839201083200201 veces
oh i love them
we need more plssss???
6:14 DONT PLAY I NEED THAT
Craziest 9 minutes of my life
Where can we vote for a part 2 ? 😂😂😂. Cuz this was funny
god if they think these are out of pocket they could‘t even fathom tt edit comment sections lol
"alright baby girl!"  " please don't do that"
"you got a little thing going on!"  " i got a little thing going on?"  i can't lmao
“ alright babygirl “ SHUTUPPPPP
Tbh this is the most PG thirst traps I’ve seen, but it was cute cause they did it together.
8:09 set Ryan all the way up.
honestly their friendship is so fun, they seem so cool, funny, lovely, love these two so much
Im sittings here giggling and swinging my legs 😅

SHOUTOUT TO THE EDITORS BECAUSE THE ZOOM INS AND THE SOUND CLIPS WERE PHENOMENAL
just gay as hell… good for them
Finally 😍😭❤️❤️❤️🫠 #Buddie
How is this the only one of these that didn't feature the word "bussy"?
I need a part 2 WITH TWEETS IN SPANISH, MAKE THOSE MEN READ THE FILTH THAT LATAM HAS TO SAY ABOUT THEM respectfully.
MY FAV VID ON THE INTERNET
I could watch them blush with these naughty tweets all dayyyy. THANK YOU BUZZFEED ❤️‍🔥😍
This was amazing!! Puppy interview with them next please ❤
oh god i really can't stop watching.
Incredible- worth the wait!!
PLEASE have Lou and Oliver do a Buzzfeed puppy interview next!! They both love dogs, it'd be perfect.
Can we have a part 2 or a puppie interview with them both again?
We definitely need them do a Puppy interview.   And this was way more wholesome, flirty, funny, raunchy and adorable than it had any right to be 😂😍🤯❤️‍🔥🤷‍♀️👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨
Can we have a part 2 or a puppie interview with them both again?

I love how Ryan barely survived this while Oliver was feeling good and confident
we absolutely NEED the puppy interview now❤
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH I NEED MORE OF THEM PLS PLS PLS
7:29 “I mean that’s what they’re for” I CANNTTTTT
8:10 that "nope" was so funny lol
These tweets were weak omg where are the mpreg buck tweets
Sooooo, part 2 yeah? 🤭🤭
I feel like I walked in on something
honestly im just surprised that buzzfeed didn't let oli read the uhm... getting him impregnated tweets cause there's ALOT LMAOOOOO
"that's what they're for" oliver excuse me
WE WANT MOREEEE 🙏🙏
I made it 29 seconds into the video and had to pause 😂😂😂
A cum shot has hit the second tower
YES BUZZFEED YES !!!! THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT- COMEON DON'T BE SHY, GUVE US MORE !!!!!
PLEASE GET THEM TO READ “ICE CREAM BEFORE DINNER”
you made my day thanks
Noooo keep doing squats ryan!!❤😂😂😢
Oliver stark likes to be called good boy confirmed
it’s an amazing week to be a buddie shipper actually
this is crazy bc i wasnt into him when he was in into the badlands lmao
Mikko escaped-
Ryan getting progressively redder is the best part of this.
Sorry but "you got a little thing going on" and "alright babygirl" fucking floored me I am deceased
Ryan ❤
Not enough filth in this video , needed more tweets like the last two they read out! Leaving a millennial gal still thirsty is a crime BuzzFeed!😂
they're sooo cute but there are soo many way better tweets come on now. we want it dirtyy
THAT'S IT?!!! This needed to be a half hour video. 😂
I NEED MOOOOORE
5:20 lmao not OS being lowkey offended but like 😭 dude. with all the love and respect in the world. you don’t quite have that level of name recognition they’re describing 😭
we need pt 2 and puppy interview bestie!!!
I need at least 9 more parts to this and a puppy interview 😭😍
Ooh knowing most of the 911 twitter accounts (if not all) and having seen the tweets before myself makes me feel like i need to touch grass lmaoooo
eles estavam flertando gente pqp
"your lips are way to plump bro" RYAN????
I feel like i was intruding on something like a whole 10 minutes of them just flirting with each other
looking at how these two blush we have to thank buzzfeed for picking relatively tame tweets 😂
IM SAT
The tweets were too light WE NEED MORE
These edits are gonna go CRAZY
I love how these are not even close to the most horny ones we have put out there 😂 Ryan knows about his waist, he needs to know about his arch. 🙏
thank you for your service buzzfeed 🫡
Watching this many times over ❤❤❤❤ puppy interview next, yes???
On 3rd viewing in less than an hr 😂
socorro deus
Spent whole 9 minutes 23 seconds giggling, kicking feet and smiling like crazy
insane cannot believe this is real life… puppies next pls
I NEED MOREEE
Oh my GOD
This is literally so gay. Ahahahah❤❤❤❤❤
I want part 2 of this, please.
the whole video is just them going between "you wrote this one didnt you" and "it would sound nice coming from you" LOL these two can't stop flirting 😅
This whole thing was full of craziness 😂  Loved it 🔥
Buddie are so Going Canon 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
*FINALLY SOME GOOD FUCKIN FOOD!*
For my tweet is that: Oliver Stark and Ryan Guzman working together in the series (9-1-1), how many mans she turned to gay?, maybe is for Eddie and Buck DIVAS....💅🏻😏😏😅"
these were actually so very mild, they were spared lmao. thank you for the skit. that was SO funny. i could have definitely watched more. bless those two
loveddddd this
I didn’t stop smiling the whole video 🤭😅😂
kinda need part 2 with craziest tweets
2:15 “we obviously get on…” *OS gets flustered, RG starts cackling* “…next question”
“i think it would’ve sounded nice coming from you" is genuinely crazy work 😭😭😭
this was too good !!!!!!!!!!
MORE. MOOOOREEE. MMMOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR!!!!!!
The chapter being typed as “sexy sut” and not “soot” Buzzfeed wtf are u doing 😭
1:27 OS “*especially when they’re going through hell” is so real lmaoooo
This is so fucking funny omg. Also PUPPY INTERVIEW WITH OLIVER YOU GOTTA
They are flirting in our faces, #whoresmembers
THAT WAS SO GOOD
Omg
Part 2: id be seated. 😂😂😂
This is incredible!! Their chemistry is amazing!! Please say there is a part 2 and then a puppy interview??
They look so good❤❤
Those fandom edit videos r gonna be LOADED NOW with this content 😭
Here for it 😂
GIVE ME MOOREEEE, I'm greedy asf
Puedo quedarme viendo esto TODO EL DÍA
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!
8:10 the way he noped out of that one so quickly had me dying 😭 love the banter between these two so much
— now read the tweet ⠀ — It would be nicer to hear it from you Oliver, diva, DIVA😂❤️‍🔥 ⠀ ⠀ I'm laughing not so much at the tweet about the back, but at Ryan's laughter and his red face🤣🤣🤣
part 2 better have more eddie diaz tweets… OR ELSE!!!!!! (also begging for aisha and tracie !)
These were too tame, most 9-1-1 thirst tweets would get buzzfeed banned from youtube.
VOGLIO IMPAZZIRE
please bring the mustache back
can't believe they had a whole talk about Ryan's slut strand just for them to brush it out of his face in the next scene wtf 😒
if we dont get buck nde ind the collapse and eddie magically coming into the explosion to save him with a passionate kiss, i dont want it. PLEASE MORE OLIVER AND RYAN CONTENT
Omg they are so hillarious i love them they are so hot when they blush😂
Ok YouTube can be shut down now because nobody will ever be able to top this video
Give me more 😊
BUZZFEED PUPPY INTERVIEW WHEN
Omg this was fireeee 😩💯💯🔥
‏‪3:29‬‏ idiot balcony scene
they summon buck and eddie character to real world, proud bisexual buck and closeted shy eddie
....do they know it's legal
i need moreeeee
why don't they ever remember their scenes 😂 not the calendar, nor the ice goes on the eye bud lmaaao
I'M LOST FOR WORDS
giggled my way through this video. this is everything
I love how in the show Buck's like this cute, shy boy and Eddie's the teasing and more outgoing while in real life Ryan's red like a tomato while Oliver's like "YES YOU GOT A SLUTTY WAIST DUDE"
I'm betting in that video when the mans hand had a mine of it's own Buck was wishing it was his hand that went crazy instead 😂 (poor eddie lol)
MY BOYS!!!!!! Yes love that they're on here
WHAT is that thumbnail bro 😂
buzzfeed i owe you my life and my entire lineage for this video
oliver enjoyed this more than i thought he would lmao
"I think it would have sounded nice coming from you" about being choked by his thighs Oliver please!!
Mds ❤❤❤❤ amo buddie 😂❤
I’m thirsty for Mr Guzman myself ❤
BROO NO WAY THEY READ MY TWEET 😭😭😭 oliver thanking me for calling him a big boy WHAT EVEN IS LIFE
Please do puppy interview next!! And then everything else because I could watch these two for hours
PLEASEE, if they’re not Canon tonight, I’m gonna lose my mind😭😭
BuzzFeed is so messy for this.  🤣
Me muero AJAJAJAJ
need a pt 2 with the feral ones, these were so easy
This is the greater day of my life! Shout out to Will and Cat cause i recognized their tweets
How is this video happening. Like. Omfg I cant. Im dead...on the floor
Thank you so much buzzfeed

8:25 ryan is weak af i would have said that out loud TWICE, man got so red
i'm so overdosed on  yaoi cocaine
Wow, they really chose the tame tweets😂
i love them so much omg that was so fun
It’s 5am in Australia and I am at work but I STOPPED FOR THIS
that was all i could have asked for an more 😽😽
These weren't even that bad, why am I blushing so hard
The way this was actually perfect
there’s so much to unpack here…
ryan is so blushable
Apologies to SJ and the crew because THEY CAN SEE THE USERNAMES
10 minutes of Ryan and Oliver flirting
Part two plz <3
Es el mejor video que vi de ellos dos y hay 8 temporadas de una serie ideal. MAS COSAS ASI
So when is the puppies interview?
this is best thing my eyes have ever watched
HES BRITISH?
10/10 no notes, well done Buzzfeed
Alsooo 4:05 "Just gotta show up and turn around" "It's where you do your best work"??? My god😂
2:05 Ryan if you don’t— 😭😭😭
Google "Ryan Guzman waist" and thank me later.
8:30 oh this ain't even scratching the surface but i love their reactions
i think they know it’s legal
Ryan all blushy the entire video.. Love to see it😂😂😭😭
TGIS WASNT EVEN THAT BADDD
Они потрясающие ❤ спасибо.
They're sitting so close at the end why 😭
thanks buzzfeed for softening the blow for whatevers coming tomorrow
Ryan: Oliver Stark- NOPE NO NOPE. YOU GOT THIS ONE Oliver: I mean you started it, might as well finish it
To funny 😅
Never has a YouTube video made me feel so flustered omg the chemistry is INSANE
I've never posted this before but:  literally who.  these are foot locker ass white dudes.
This is the best video of 2025
this was amazing lmaoooo
Everyone say thank you intern
We need oliver and ryan in the puppy interview🥰🐶🐾
Ryan calling Oliver my boy 😭
THIS WAS SO FUNNY
I couldn’t stop smiling and giggling watching this, it was so worth the wait. Honestly Oliver and Ryan are the cutest and funniest 😂❤
We might not get Buddie this season but these interviews are very telling😂
Already rewatching don't play
You heard Oliver, puppy interview next. Pleaseeeee
I CAN'T STOP WATCHING I NEED MORE
2:04 "We're just the most coupled uncouple" "We are, we are very coupled together" I'm sorry WHAT
Oh they know 100% that one tweet is about the calendar circled with a heart around it, they're just playing dumb
And I agree with each and everyone of them
Feeling very fine and normal after watching this.
I’m scared 💀
i cannot believe i was smiling through this whole thing but yk what i'm only human
3:42 that's when chimney punches buck and he gets a black eye! i just watched this
Not Ryan almost doing the topping tweet then he had to harden pass because he knows what we would do with that
This is the best thing that's ever happened.
Im watching this on my break at work and im dying trying not to crash out.
The way this was the longest thirst tweets video on the channel but it still wasn’t enough I’m——  also BUDDIE NEEDS TO HAPPEN ASAP & I feel like there were wayyyyy crazier and borderline feral tweets in the community 😭
I think I have a new obsession. Im smiling and laughing so hard my face hurts 😂, amoooooo 🫶
Oh god 😂😂😂😂😂
How is this real?! OMG we won SO MUCH
“is that the consent you’ve been waiting for, not from me, from them” BRO
Empezó y yo ya estaba sentada 🫢
That was so fun !
this video will be my new personality
“my butt has been all over” oh lord
*Gorgeous sexy couple both **#Buddie** & **#Ryliver* 😍🔥
“that’s what they’re there for” WHAT DO YOU MEAN OLIVER!! SOMEONE SAVE ME I CANT BREATH
Oliver like the stache 😭
This was very tame😭
BEDDIE 🛌!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Despite my imperfections” AND POINTS AT HIS BIRTHMARK BABYGIRL YOUR BIRTHMARK IS MEANT TO BE THERE STOPPPP 7:20
Ryan calling Oliver babygirl was not on my bingo card this year but i take it
thankyou buzzfeed we all said in unison
IS IT LEGAL AGAIN??
this is simply the best thing i saw today
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA IM DEAD i can’t stop smiling
We need a round two of this 😂😂 this was hilarious!!
Their chemistry is too good, those were the tamest tweets ever tho I see much worse every day! Why were most of them about Oliver/Buck too, not Ryan/Eddie being sidelined again…
sooo they do see the handles….
"my butt has been all over" 🤣😭🤣😭
Damn these were barely thirsty! More flattering than anything else…
We want Oliver and Ryan in the puppy interview🥰
Mis papás ❤
All they did was flirt this entire video and I'm here for it.
Buck with the accent!  🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NOT RYAN IN TEARS ME TOO BABE ME TOO😭😭
7:30 "THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOR" YESSSSSSS they are
omg the edits are gonna be insane..
i have never clicked on a video so fast before MAKE BUDDIE CANNON
IM FOREVER CHANGED THANK YOU BUZZFEED
this is going premium in my house
Show up and turn around 🍑
🤣🤣🤣
them not knowing that the “ice goes on the eye bud” scene is a BUDDIE scene makes this much funnier 😭
OMG THAT LAST ONE WAS HILARIOUS XDDDDDDDDD
lmfaooooo best thing to ever happen this year
I LOST IT WHEN HE SAID “WOOF WOOF”
Thank you Buzzfeed, I will be watching this on a loop for the foreseable future.
Ryan’s reaction about Oliver stark topping might be the best thing I have ever been blessed with since I was given the gift of sight
WHAT DO YOU MEAN “we obviously get on” THEN YOU CLEAR YOUR THROAT AND SAY “ next question” WHILE RYAN IS GIGGLING???? GET TF OUT MY FACE RIGHT NOW.
my cheeks hurt from smiling so much
6:54 Alright, BuzzFeed, we better get that!
8:32 Ryan blushing
MY SHOW IS AWNNNN
15 MINUTES LATE OMG
i’m going insane
they only need to do these w ppl excited to do them bc what was this
What I’ve learned is that we need more of Ryliver content because this was hysterical
guys. the time stamps i love yall buzzfeed
did this actually just happen to me
they were just flirting the whole time
This is sooo goooood we're thriving
8:09 Ryan got SOOO FLUSTERED 🤣😂🤣🤣 He backed out so quick. He knew what the fans would do with that audio 😊😊😊😊
Omg I can’t even watch this man like
i really did not anticipate when i heard they were doing this that it would be 10 minutes of them flirting i won't lie
8:47-8:53 Ryan said "...ran through..." and Oliver and I had the same reaction.  😂 Poor guys learned so much slang from these tweets! 😅
These poor men have no idea how tame that was. I've seen so much worse
the whole fandom is SAT
This is the healthiest most wholesome thing I’ve seen in awhile. This is how two male actors whose characters are shipped together should act. Love them
That was incredible give me 10 more of them
We need the Puppy Interview with these guys ASAP!!
I think I just had an out of body experience
Oh god
this was not enough
COMPARED TO SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE READ, THIS ONES WERE REALLY MILD!!! 😂😂😂
can’t believe they didn’t use mikko’s pinned tweet but also unsurprised i think it could’ve broken ryan 😂
oh my god
o melhor vídeo de todos
I love how Ryan stopped reading mid tweet to say "he does that already" when he got to the rescuing dogs only for it to say that too 😂
THEYRE SO FUNNY HELP
oh my what a ride
I have read worst so we are safe haha my mind has thought scenes that can make both of you become a tomato in like 0.05 sec
I was here
This was perfect. Thank you.   (Please feel free to give us a part 2 and 3 and 4 etc because 1 round isn't enough 😘)
💀💀💀 we obviously get on -next question Oliver readjusting himself Ryan laughing WDYMMM
we need a puppy interview next
WERE THEY FLIRTING
CRYING THE WHOLE TIME😭
My face hurts from grinning the whole time
NEW FAV VIDEO EVER FOREVER AND MORE
So… about the puppy interview?
HAHAHAHAHA BEST EPISODE EVER
they’re blushing and that’s not even the worst ones 😭😭 WE NEED PART 2 WITH THE BAAAAAD ONES PLEASE
I need more
somebody bring me back for the puppy interview
OKAYYY THIS WAS SOOOO GOOODDD!!!! THOUGH RYAN FEARED SUCCESS NOT WANTING TO READ SOME OF THEM AND MAKING OLIVER DOING IT!!! 😂😂😂
glad we finally got justice for the 'babygirl' nation
Ten minutes of ryliver flirting with each other 😭
MORE MORE MORE!! BUZZFEED PUPPY INTERVIEW NEXT PLEASE

life is so good rn
"buck buckley" is my biggest pet peeve in this fandom THATS NOT HIS NAME

That was not nearly enough thirst tweets, and you can tell they know something.
IM KICKING MY FEET AND BLUSHING OVER OLIVER LIKE WTFFFFF
I can't believe I'm watching this omg I love my boys
Buzzfeed puppy interview with Oliver Stark when?!?!?
THAT WAS THE FASTEST AND FLIRTIEST 10 MIN IN MY LIFE

Lmaoooooaoaooaoa I’m already screaming, this is gonna be so good! 👏🏽🔥 Rip to Mikko, Tress, SJ, and Cherry tho! 😔🤣
Запись будет? Я не успею это посмотреть

omg.
I AM SOOO READY

And immediately after this video- someone said… hmmm maybe let’s separate them for Upfronts press!
Oh, let's GO!!
Can't wait to see people I follow religiously get publicly shamed. This is my big brother
I am waiting patiently☺️
Girl it need to drop alr 😭
I'm so excited for this iconic video
i can’t watch it bc i have something to do but i swear the moment i leave the function this will be on my phone istg
The amount of fanfic that will come from this video 🤣🤣🤣
I am sat 👀
I’m sat
it was rare, i was there, or whatever taylor swift said
we’re winning so hard with this video and i’m here for it
Praying for eddieshole
I'm ready to see my oomfs (I'm thirsting silently, glad I'm safe)
Ryan Guzman crying with laughter? Oliver Stark and the eyebrow of judgement? Seated. Sat. Cannot wait for the full video.
buzzfeed putting us on BLAST 😭
Video not out and almost 2k likes already 😂
I have no interest in watching any more of this queerbaiting show but this will fuel a lot of fanfics, so there's at least a positive side to it. Also Ryan Guzman is just another Jansen Ackles and Buddie is just another Destiel, Quote me on that.
rg is gonna come out redder than any tomato ever
I've never been more excited for a vid before LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
here for our national treasure: blushy RG
