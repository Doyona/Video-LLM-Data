Im lready on 7 medals... This is my most active season 😂
Got 6 already from the first two seasons and just adding from there. I hope it’s a sniper.
The ak one hundred and seventeen yes yes
I'm pretty confident the kill effect on this altas corp 2025 elite mission gun would be of dark shepherd theme (figured out from matching last two years confidential token with this year's) and for next year I think patnthom corp will take over
J'espère qu'on aura un snip légendaire comme arme
yo quiero que la skin legacy sea ametralladora ligera una holger o haces o bruen
6
Sports Is bro, hte ah ni skou, nop la ou su Mobile😢
I have already 7 of those so why i can't get it??? Please someone answer me it's my first year
I hope it will be sniper
I need 2 medal 🏅 to unlock legendary 🎉
What’s the fixed date ?
I had 3/6 legendary medals last season then I recently got legendary in br and MP ranked matches and it still hasn't changed to 5/6. Will it take next year to reflect?
6 tokens yes waiting yes knowing what it is no🤣
I have 7 medals now....  I hope the Legendary reward weapon is mac 10
Not sure what I like to see. Hope not a shotgun. Not a big fan of them.
i think its going to be about the bal 27 because it comes from advanced warfare and its also atlas corporation
5 legendary medles
I’m at 3 medals already 💪🏾
4
Hey I've subscribed can u please upgrade my loadout
Hey @PAPAJOEYT, you indicated that the Atlas Corporation is an enhanced military with high quality equipment (1:31). By the sounds of it, the Legacy Gun might consists of high quality kill effect, futuristic like theme.  Also, since it’s a high quality gun, it’ll might mean the Legacy Gun would be a modern but good gun. So we’re expecting a gun that was a Meta in the past or present, and there’s a reason why. There’s only 2 Legacy Guns in CODM right now, Mac-10 - Bast Idol and Type 25 - Phoenix Inferno. Comparing with these 2 guns, we have good guns that are overrated/underrated. And here are the possible lists of guns that might be the Legacy Gun:  • 𝖬𝖷9 • 𝖦𝗋𝖺𝗎 5.56 • 𝖮𝖽𝖾𝗇 • 𝖡𝖯50 • 𝖱𝖺𝗆-7 • 𝖵𝖬𝖯 • 𝖪𝗈𝗌𝗁𝗄𝖺 • 𝖨𝖢𝖱-1 • 𝖬13 • 𝖣𝖫 𝖰33 • 𝖲𝗐𝗂𝗍𝖼𝗁𝖻𝗅𝖺𝖽𝖾 𝖷9 • 𝖫𝖠𝖯𝖠 • 𝖴𝖲𝖲 9 (𝖫𝗈𝗐 𝖢𝗁𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾) • 𝖨𝖲𝖮
I hope its locus or krm
Cant wait for the weapon i already have 6 because i grinded this season for mp and mp 10k and then br
I hope it isn’t a sniper or a shot gun lol a waste of a grind lol
I got 7 so far
i hope that legacy is grau
I only have 3 medals how do I get six?
How to collect 6 medals..
I got 7 is it possible to get more for this season?
I can get it on s6 I done 6 legendaries
2:25 THATSS ME I DIDNT REALIZE I WAS IN THIS EDIT NICE GO CHECK ME OUT! BUT WHY IS BRO SHOWING HIM SELF KILLING BOTS COME ON SHOW REAL KILLS!🫩🫩🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

I have 7
Up great my account pls😢😢
I'm always waiting for your videos😢
I got seven now
call of Duty  mobile
Bro it is available in 2025 S6 How Should We Unlock It ☝🏻
Well we all need is a weapon with high accuracy fire rate mid damage like 27 - 29 & control
I have 6 medals but I can't unlock Atlas weapon how its is impossible I don't know??? Sorry for my English is not very good but I hope so that understand me...bye bro 💪🏻
I wish USS9 Gatekeeper will be the Legacy on season 6
U are killing bot
Where's the free Motoko joe
I am a new player and don't have legendary medals. Only have one which I got from new festival event and now I am in grandmaster 4 and will try to reach legendary so I will have 2 medals. But can I collect the remaining 4 in this year? Or not? Please anyone tell me. Or I don't get the chance to obtain legacy weapon? 😅
Grau, uss9, ram would be dope
Give up the dlq
3:08 grau 5.56 - Primordial, makes eense because the meaning of Primordial is "beginning of time", and the theme (if i can call it that) is "Before the fall", So adding 2 and 2 makes sense now
I want it to be a lw3,dlq r a locus.and I have 6 medals
I only have 2 medals and I think I wouldn't get it 🥲
Do you think if we could reach 9 times legendary at once,  can we get the legacy weapon?
I have 6 with just needing to get legendary in the next 3 seasons to have 9.  If you try until the end then competition will be fiercer.  So don’t slack!  Hahahaha 😂
I have 18 mythics,70+ legendaries and 1 legacy
I really hope it’s going to be a sniper, I want a free sniper
new update pls
W Video

I have 5
Yo lit! Stretch em out! On Go!

Krig or Grau the best in br and mp bro
Bruh the title of this video should be ai yapping nonsense for 7:40 min thank God YouTube is banning ai videos
I have 6 but I got nothing I have to white an tell s6  now only s3 👉👌
The legacy weapons are beyond mid imo🤢
It should be sniper😢
I have 5 legendary medals this season will make it 6 medals
grau❤
It going to be good if they added a gail AR from BO1or bo2
Claim nhi ho rhi
I’m sorry my dear campers but you are not the community of players their gonna listen to when it comes to free weapons only campers can use
Can somebody tell activison to repair secret caches? 2 shards maximum from 15 boxes is just wild bad , tell them to fix that!
We need a krm skin
Bro yap too much
Well it’s a good thing I’ve been grinding the last couple of seasons for legendary rank cuz I could have completely missed this 😅
I already have 6 medals
did anyone get it i got 6 medals but i cant open it
2
Uss9 pray
Omg , i have 4 tokens i just need this season and ill get both , i already have the one they gave last year
Cool moves 😮
So far, I have five legacy metals. After this season, I will have seven I’m hoping for the HS2126. That would be pretty sweet! However, they will probably do a DLQ.
I wish we had an option to claim old rewards by collecting more medals
Please upgrade my account 🙏🏾
Can you release the new test server pls❤❤
@PAPAJOEYT according to your video, it's gonna be Grau- Primordial. So, yeah, I'm thinking Assault, they've given SMG, so yes it's going to be assault rifle. They need to disburse some legacy weapon that can be widely used, Marksman, Sniper and Shotgun, they're difficult to play aggressive. Since most like to play aggressive instead of camping, So I believe it's assault rifle.
How is this possible how can I get all this that u guys are saying and please someone should help me 🙏 wht game will I play to get this one 😢
Thanks bro I have 5 legendary meds
Bro, you always repeat yourself and you make 90% of your video meaningless, just cut to the chase for once
USS 9 Gets I Guess🔥🔥
I reached 4/6 medals last season. Soon i will be reaching 6/6 this month .😊
Bro are you from India?
I want free cp
Sry I'm late😢
Hohoo Joe is good to miss u anyway is time to unsup
"Idea for Call of Duty Mobile × Squid Game Collaboration: Imagine a 'Red Light, Green Light' mode, Squid Game-inspired Operator skins (like Frontman or the guards), and limited-time events based on the challenges from the series. It would be an insane hit! Please consider this crossover!"  – From a dedicated fan who's dreamed of this event for years.
Thanks bro not gonna lie have been seeing this but don't know what it's for,where to start no idea but Thanks by the way
If they give us uss9 leggy then that guy will forever remain the most abused gun in the game.😂😭
W Papa Joe🗣️🗣️😊
There is actually a blueprint of how the weapon would look in one of the chambers at military research institute
Damn gotta grind now
Papa joe where can I update  call of duty mobile Activision??tap tap  app cannot update anymore...any suggest app where can I update ??Google play don't update because of our region is not available...

Papafake

I Hope Groza
I only have 5 legerdy medal
If it's a LOCUS then it's worth grinding ❤
Bro yapping for like 30 yrs
*I love your videos, informative, interesting...*
I don't get any rus shards except token exange
How many seasons does it last?? because I only have 3,I'm scared I can't get it in time
Hey why I can grind only one token in this season
It would be a line 3 rifle from ww2
I click the video because i see Motoko
Hopefully it's a qq9 skin
I already Got 6 medals
It better be a sniper
Literally I am starting from this season so I think I will only get the skin and no effects😢
To those who are asking about GULAG in ISOLATED, don't worry because it's only limited and will be back next season.😊
Who leaked our secrets?
Pashotout papi 😊
Free wepon from 6 legendary medals is grau?
4
When can we collect the atlas  weapon crate?  I got 6 medals now can we unlock it now or it will unlock later???
It seems I won't be getting the gun this time. I only have 5 medals and the time for grinding for  legendary medals is over. That is what they said to me
This. Show his
outlaw would dominate mp rounds bc of mp sweats
We need sniper
What is this ai
Why does the thumbnail says free MOTOKO?
I need motoko ✋🏻😭🤚🏻
i have 5 leg medals and only need one ore i'll tell u what it is once i unlocked the leg rank this season i'm currenly at GM 3
Btw aint the max amount of medals you can get per year is 9 right?
Anything like Uss9 Bp50 Fennec Mg42 M13 Oden Or snipers i like snipers
I really hope it being a meta or a fan favourite
I technically got 6 medals till now
Let me check
I got like 5 medals i guess?
Bro how did you get that character skin the short hair?
Btw can i get that Legendary lk24 now?
I only have 3 medal legendary and we need 6? How can i get other 3
Wait a minute. 9 legendary medals! this is definitely going to a bit harder to get especially for BR mains like me and if I played MP I'll always be placed with the top players because my lobbies are bunch of high-ranking sweats and I'm just a casual player. damm.
If it will be the grau 5.56  it will be great n hot , but I think this time they going for some sniper n it will be disappointing
New legacy is going to be man o war
Been watching your vids for a while—real inspiration 🔥 I just started uploading CODM content too. Would mean a lot if you gave it a look 🙏
Will the motoko battlepass ever come back to the vault battlepass?
Hopefully a marksman.
Bro please bee a sniper 😢
Dlq Or. FENNEC or Grau and And I wish We could choose what we want ❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻 Plz Send this to CODM We can choose the gun I rather have the DLQ😢
Are we developing legacy weapons?   No, we are not  Because we've already developed it
I really want the bast idol to return i wanna buy itt
I hope its just 6 legendary medals
I paid good money for that skin and now they are giving it away lol
PapJoe is back 🤞😂👏
I have 5 medals 👍👍👍
Plz one video for drh kurohana comeback in event section same like m4 legendary 😢I missed drh plz let one video for Activision team😢

3:08 Is that a Grau?
Bro keep going
5 🎖️¯\_(ツ)_/¯
will there be any chance that the drh kurohana might return?
Bro my girl was asking what gun came with my Anubis guy lol
I wish it going to be A BP50 or a grau.
Hdr
Hopefully  a sniper
Please it ll be krig or oden
Wee need sniper bro
Vote for original voice videos
I want USS9 Legacy
Would they ever give us a free KRM legendary
Now the game should give one legendary or mythic dlq
Knowing the devs it will be yet another qq9 skin because everyone knows we need more qq9 skins…..
Please give us a Peacekeeper skinnnnn
Brio is 1 week late 😢
I have 2 medals as of last season and getting third one this season will i be able to get the legacy weapon pls someone help..
I'm quite confused, is it till the end of this year or this month?. Like if I'm currently at 3, and would be reaching 6 by November. So would it still be available till then? 😢
I have four legendary metals, but I really want it to be a sniper rifle DL Q33
I wish Legacy weapon is of Grau 🔥🔥🔥
My Goat is back💪💯
The first legacy was ar Second was smg Maybe the third one might be different but since it's free then it might be ar as most free guns are ar, who knows
WE NEED SNIPER OR MARKSMAN RIFLE
I have 6😊
Any news on mythic oden?
I really hope it’s not a Legacy Cold War weapon. I’m really hoping it is a legacy weapon from Advanced Warfare, it should be that way.
I think the legacy weapons will be the Atlas 20mm - Virtuosity based on the ZRG 20MM
I have three now, how many raank reset before end of year?
you're the best🎉
i have 5 medals in this season
I hope for an sniper
I played cod advanced warfare and finished it 4 times due to I exciting story
I wish it is the oden
Click bait not a good channel
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
We don't know what the elite mission gun is gonna be but it's definitely not a FFAR tho... Anyone claiming otherwise is just speculating
I hope it's a ak117 legacy or uss9
lol always the same news. gonna unsubscribe unfortunately you're just farming for views by sharing the same video over and over again. Have some shame!!!
Clicbait bro?
A melee weapon IG 🫳🏻
Nice click bat bro
I just want them to fix my account. My game. I don’t get mvp moments anymore in MP. Anyone who is in my lobby doesn’t get to see them either. So it’s not my phone as “support” tries to say. I’ve jumped through all their hoops and still no MVP moment (where you get to see two of the kill moments in the game). Anyone else, IF they get MVP, we can all see their moments.
7:06 hopefully fennec, 3-line or something else that is a good weapon, if its gonna be another ar atleast be krig or oden
I know it is a shotgun skin
We need Dlq33
Who hia ?? Grau 5.56- Primordial Legend??? Weapon 2026? What 💀 the just vohe ''Legend'' you can ❤'' LEGEND'' The ''S6 2026'' how (Weapon inspection ▶️)
I think I saw in game  main skin was  argus and other was hg40 skin
I got 4
Papa joe why your so noob😂
Thank you for the info!❤
I have 5 already not including season 7
I need krm262 legendary skin in Atlas. And i know this is not possible 😢 .
*Who can believe, we just received two "legacy" weapons in the entire game and the third one is "FREE" 💀💀*
Please, I want the gun is ak117 or krig 6
It need 10 leggy medals for all the features bcs I’ve already got 4 and said weapon fully upgraded
Free cod points please call of duty lol
Thankyou for letting me know
Bro , how can I fix load out glitch, I can change the guns but they don't show up in a Rank match . 😢
Its prolly an ar since it has a m4 on the notice
Why I can only get one medal cuz I already have 5 and codm only give me one medal in this season 😢
His Thumbnail 😮 , the whole video 🤮
when is the legacy weapon coming?
I Miss Your Video's 😢
Does anyone know when they are bring back motoko BP vault
I think QQ9 is the best choice for legacy weapon
I got all 6 metals. I'm going for 7 in BR.
Click bait
Guys i ha e a question what if the legacy wepon drop alr and i still have not enough the medal thing will the wepon stay until i have enough medal of it will be gone
The legacy weapon, I prefer the Type 25 from the design 🎉😊
𝕀𝕟𝕥𝕖𝕣𝕖𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘
Sniper rifle please 🙏
Please Please i wish it would be a Sniper like DLQ 33 HDR or LW3 Tundra
The only thing that they could do to make me have interest in the legacy variants would be giving them the tac sprint animation  I wonder if they add the bal27 and this legacy could be the obsidian steed 🤔
Thank you so much for these leaks bro much appreciated love ur content btw ❤
𝒀𝒉𝒉 𝑰 𝒄𝒂𝒏'𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒂 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒄𝒉 𝒉𝒐𝒘 𝒊𝒕 𝒈𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌 𝑰 𝒐𝒏𝒍𝒚 𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒅 𝟐 𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆 metals 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑰 𝒈𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐 𝒈𝒆𝒕 𝒊𝒕🎉🎉
Papa Joe if we pass the elite mission can't we receive this reward
Umm this confused me so after I get the last metal I will have to wait?
@PAPAJOEYT if there's possible might be added a legacy weapon in secret cache system in between legendary and mythic weapon blueprint in the near future?
Krieg should technically be a legacy it’s originally a master craft from Cold War
I think it's SMG for legacy weapon in elite mission final reward
i am ganna cry i just have 2 medal i cant get lagecy
Words cannot describe how fast I clicked on the video when it popped up on my feed
Mac10 will be better
Idk why i would swap my lk24 for the kurohana idk why I want it so bad
I quit this dumb lying game
I already got 6 legendary medals
Might be an old meta cos it says "before the fall"
Grau 55.6 ❤❤❤ next free legendary
2/6 legendary medals
The pictures shown at the beginning showed the mythic grau 5.56 but in different colour...
The most clicl bait.  Channel of all time.
My moneys on the leggy asval that has been leaked
