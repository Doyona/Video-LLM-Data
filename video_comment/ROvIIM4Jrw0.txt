And I always get this weird stares from guys whenever I check out some shirts on me infront of the mirror, I just can't hold my laugh sometimes. Like bruh,  you guys' shirts are too comfy and I'm a sucker for comfy shirts! 😅😍
I hate when people steal other peoples content ideas and dont even give them credit. This was The Mermaidscales idea.

Why she got more men stuff then everything💀💀💀
Guys and kids
I hate dresses and skirts:)
I'm 13 but I can't go in the kid's part 😅
We might as well spend it all

Am I the only person who is ten years old and actually hates going to the kids section? Because the clothes there are always so uncomfortable, or i don't feel like the design fits well with my age, i always feel like they only make stuff for 4-7 year olds or something... 😓
Im a girl and i love boyish outfits its so comfy and asthetic
That's me as mother 😂. I bought my husband's and kid's clothes, but then I forgot to buy my own 😂

So true
Bro wth is mermaid scales 😭
I love boys clothes like idk why but they are just so much better!
So true 😂
Sooooo true
Can you stop copying it’s starting to get annoying now (no hate)
Bruhhhhh why are you shopping in the kids section its for kids omg😂😂😂😂😂
Ok yall Mermaid Scales DOES NOT own every idea. Its not copying because she even made it herself completely. Like y'all its getting annoying how people think there's should be credits and stuff. But like, there is no mention of Mermaid Scales in the vid, Krutika isnt even in the vid, and the audio isnt taken, nor is anything else. It may have been the same song, but she didn't steal the audio from the video. If she did, you would have been able to see the vid if you clicked on the audio. Both creators are great and i love them both so much!!❤ Please correct me if i made a mistake or said something wrong but please dont think its copying because it isn't.
Yeahh im a girl ❤❤😂😂

"911 what seem to be the problem "  THIS  FAMOUS YOUTUBER IS STALKING ME😭😭
Fuuuuuuuuuu
I want to be a surgeon since that I was two and a half years old. My mom still has a video in what I say I want to be a surgeon , my mom said not a prinses ? I said I want to cure people . I am now 13 years old and good on track to be a surgeon. I am now doing the highest education possible in the Netherlands and I am the only tinted person in my classes ( I am Moroccan but I was born in the Netherlands ) people are very racist but I learned to Handel with that even if it isn’t something that should happen 😢 I deal with pretty bad anxiety cuz a lot of people think that a tinted girl can be a surgeon cuz they’re dirty and poor (no flex but my parents work both fulltime and I am blessed with them) I hate that also teachers say things like if I don’t now a question “typical something for a foreigner “   One time I cried in the middle of a lesson cuz a got a text that my grandpa his hart was failing really bad and if I leaved the classroom I would be suspended en could not be a surgeon any more so I waited 55 minutes before I could go to my grandpa and he onfortunetly died    Btw thanks for reading ❤❤❤

I know it’s like mermaidscales as you people say but pls just stop pointing it out and just let her to continue to be happy making her videos. Look at her cheerful face, she doesn’t even deserve all of comments on some of her videos because they aren’t sometimes that friendly. Pls be socially kind and even on the internet treat others as if they were nice to you, do the same😊
Yes I am😊
In 2024 kids now shop in the women section🤣🤣🤣
