Very close to pulled pork sandwhich from Mississippi with slaw and bbq sauce.  Sooo good.  This video makes me hungry.
Texas BBQ made in England? I don't know
I’m hungry now 😅❤
13:40 Bruh imma go make some cornbread right now. Wtf
These poor boys must have had the meat-sweats for the first time after this.
"what age can you move to America" idk, just do it🔥🔥🔥
This why America has so much obesity and  health issues!
HOW AM I AMERICAN AND NEVER TRIED THISSS
At first I was like why are they putting the beans on the bread that I remember that's what they do there..
The moment those children said they didnt like the chill w bean the American in me wanted to take there BBQ away LMAOOOOO
“My eyes are watering.” That kid finally met the meat-sweats 😂
I live in Texas and I’m so spoiled that this is 10-15 min down the street from me. I could eat TBBQ every day if it wasn’t so expensive
I want to meet these guys lol
Nap time!
i’m from texas (away for university) and damn do i miss good barbecue
that one kid saying “that’s lovely” every single time 🥹
I've had brisket at Dickies and I'm not really a fan of it. Nice to see people from around the world liking texan bbq though!
Omg... I'm gonna have to make another brisket on my pellet grill now... 😊😊😊
Now I need to go get some bbq for lunch and I never even eat lunch.
I’m born and raised in the south this is our normal weekend
“If you could get this here, how often do you think you wou-“ “EVERYDAY.”
They look like they’re in middle school
Ahhh, y’all needed to add honey butter to the cornbread, don’t eat it by itself! 😭
A little kid sounds just like the one from Adolescence
Cornbread with NO butter is crazy
No now I'm HUNGRY 😭
Are Monty and Finley twins?
Are you sure they're ready for that? 😂
U need real honey for the cornbread
Best bbq is usually going to be from the highschool bbq teams especially the all state winners. They get it down to a science and can cook a brisket in about 8-10 hours that’ll be better than any other brisket you’ve had
I love tuese becuase you get to see these british lids have a come to jesus
I’m literally eating ribs while watching this 😂
We have the meat sweats! 😂😂
Like how could a 7 year old on 9 year old be a high school or then I will be a high school
they look like they are in 7th Heaven
How you about to disrespect Mac and cheese like that
Whats the point in giving people good meat and food and seeing if they like it or not
Mac and cheese is not a southern thing, it's midwestern but has spread all around the country just because it's inoffensive and easy to make. I definitely wouldn't associate it with barbecue.  Also, that cornbread was way too dry. You gotta add a bunch of honey when you bake it, and then smother it with butter when you eat it. Dry cornbread is barely edible, but made properly, it's the best dinner bread ever created.
I'm always shocked that the UK still has horrific food in 2025. Like, are they STILL not able to come up with anything worth eating+? Thankfully these kids get to taste some flavor.
Man I want some bbq now
As someone that lives in Texas our BBQ is the best hands down. They need to try fried okra as well. Then get them to try a seafood boil.
"...not a fan of mac and cheese." "... my mom makes this a lot." Wow kid, you're dead where you stand
Texas bbq is a whole different level when you go to new restaurants. Competition is fierce and there are newcomers being the best bbq spots annually. Texas bbq is few of the best in America.
It’s okay bro, I don’t care for cornbread all that much either. And I’m from the south 😂
The teacher was having the time of his life😄😄😄. God bless his heart✝️🙏🏾.
If you can taste tea in your southern sweet tea then it's not southern sweet tea. You've been lied to.
I've honestly never been a massive fan of cornbread either, it's one of those things where it's not meant to be enjoyed by itself. And it always seems like it's either dry and kind of tasteless, or it's basically sponge cake. But I will at the very least put a bit of melty butter on there, sop it in meat juices and scarf it down.
This is what I have been waiting for 😂😂
As an American who lived in Texas for a little bit, it makes me laugh seeing these kids cry over how good Texas bbq is 😂
LOL British food is like a Honda Civic and American  food is like a Lamborghini 😂🎉
LOL 😂🎉 you ruined them, now all the British food is extremely average 😂
I love seeing here boys tuck in to great American BBQ.  So much better than fast food!
Was it just me, but wasn't it bothering that they just had plain texas bread. Like you can't really have true texas toast with a barbecue plate, unless that Texas toast is buttered and toasted. You can't just go with a plain slice of bread. When it's toasted, it elevates the food you have it with.   Also, for that cornbread, you should put some butter on it. It brings it to another level.
“How does one eat this without getting burnt” such a British phrase 😂
People are learning why Americans are soo fat. YAAAA!!NOW YOU UNDERSTAND NOW DONT YA!!!!!  NOW YOU WONT MAKE AS MUCH FUN OF US NOW WILL YA!!!
I love this video! Those boys need to try a good old bowl of cornbread (no sugar) and buttermilk!
Respectful of someone to First ask, "What age can we Legally move to America"? Since so many think they can just steal citizenship!
They don't have bbq there?  That's sad!!
Someone rescue britain from its own food man😭
No cause who made that cornbread😭
Where are the girls?   Are there no girl “highschoolers” in the UK?
This is cool! watched video all the way through! did you segregate the kids?
The headmaster is there to eat… screw the review lol
The way they describe the food is so fancy, love it! Lol
That mack kid at 1:18 looks like brat pitt.
So it seems like were getting a few more Americans 🇺🇸😎
A proper American BBQ might've civilly resolved the war for Independence. This video is evidence of that.
Now they should understand why we’re so over weight in the US…🤣🤣🤣
It’s bbq, I knew they’d love it lol
The Heinz beans that the British put on toast or American.
This is too cool 😎. The Legends Approve of this Message
just revisited this video after the short of this popped up. noticed the Mammoth Mountain shirt! love it
best corn bread skillet 🍳 cheese 🧀 jalapeños bacon 🥓 some real corn 🌽 🔥
It may not beat beans on toast but it's a staple for a reason
the twins reactions to pickles ✨
Dang what are they eating over there.
Bbq is amazing. A properly cooked brisket is one of the best meaats you can have
Makes me curious what Beitish food taste like
This why we fat are good is amazing 😂
2:44 we all been there little buddy 😊
I am not sure if these British high schoolers are indicative of all English children of the same age . But compared to American children…. These young men are well mannered , articulate and very courteous ….. You can actually understand what they are saying .
Ive never been soo jealous of this series till this video
Ohhh, the meat looks so delicious. And I'm craving corn bread with BBQ pit beans with beef. Yummy! The Texas Fold - wonderful blend of food and do good.
how do i sign up for this
I love cooking/baking for people that genuinely enjoy food and I can see why you've done so many videos with the headmaster, his reactions and commentary are pure gold!  He's someone I would never tire of cooking for :)
Add butter to corn bread
They’re so cute
Wow… we give the British kids Texas BBQ and brisket, and the Brits give the American kids Marmite and beans. No fair.
As a Texan, I didn't know it was called a Texas fold, but that is how you eat Texas BBQ.
How come girls don't get to try all these yummy things? It's kinda cruel lol😂
How come girls don't get to try all these yummy things? It's kinda cruel lol😂
How come girls don't get to try all these yummy things? It's kinda cruel lol😂
White is coming out of my mouth 😭
The headmaster loves everything lol
Britain may have conquered half the world be we have better food
You gentlemen should try this with professional strongmen weight lifters. I’ve seen one where they try American snacks. I think having them eat Texas BBQ would make a great vid.
The only thing you boys did wrong was give them cornbread without butter! Otherwise....Great, entertaining video
The curly hair kid is my favorite 😂
I’m from the south and can confirm that brisket is AMAZING 🤤
I wonder why an American doesn’t open up a Texas barbecue over there and make a fortune
Imagine taking a plate home like “mom I have American food l 😂😂❤
As someone who's living in Texas seeing this brings happiness to me cuase a Texas BBQ always good
This is like giving a caveman an iphone
Curious observation, with all the cornbread you’ve had, has it not been suggested to eat it with butter and honey? The way we eat cornbread in our family (in Oregon) is out of the pan served warm with melted butter and honey. Otherwise it can be dry. Super good with chili in addition to BBQ.  (Side note: Clam chowder is also good with cornbread even though I do prefer it with Buttermilk biscuits or sour dough.)
If the cornbread isn’t sweet it’s not cornbread
Ok y’all are cutting the brisket to think
@13:41 lmao 🤣
They’re right, the only thing I eat cornbread with is chili or bean soup. I leave it out when it comes to BBQ. 😂
Glad you did this. We got you beat
0:33 Bro just wanted a free meal, he older than the teachers 🥀🥀
Fellas you did it in the wrong order you start with the sausage first. Also put butter on the cornbread before you try it. And try it with the macaroni and cheese. Then you go on to the big dogs
Oh no put some butter on that cornbread 😂
Yall gotta drizzle honey or put butter on the cornbread.
I’m not a fan of corn bread either.
What did they their parents say? “FOOK THOSE DAM YANKEES!”
Marty is a gentleman
OK, you two have officially ruined British food for the next 1000 years! How did you get Texas BBQ to the UK!
Texan here, the best part of excellent bbq is sharing it with those around you. Every time I go have bbq I have to rewatch this video because I forget how lucky I am sometimes. Cheers y'all!
You should do one with girls
As a well traveled southerner whos been to several countries and most states, only one type of food has ever rivaled legit southern Bbq to me. Japanese and thai curry
GO WILLIAM FORD I NEED THIS 😂
Love watching the kids try new food items, but, can u do a show with the two of you and DAVE??man is hilarious..and a lot slimmer than he used to to be!!! …..I’m Canadian and cannot believe the food items the kids never heard of or tried. Ie Ribs…in Canada most homes have at least a bbq outside, and smokers are becoming so popular…..everything is better on the bbq!!!
What I thought was funny was how they said the Mac n cheese was too cheesy and wanted it to be more bland lol! 😂
The headmaster is so awesome.
It reminds me of David Copperfield and the starving orphans.
That’s Fulham boys school
Love y’all’s channel I swear, I enjoy seeing people try new food and you guys go the extra mile 🫶🏼
This is why Americans are fat
Honey butter for the cornbread.
5:15  CRISTIANOOOO
1:47  I had ribs like 2 months ago and I can still taste it whenever I lick my fingers
Am I seeing britishers using hands! 😂
Have to eat properly cooked cornbread. Hated it as a kid until I cooked my own for the first time and started eating it when my mom cooks it.
Thats lovely🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥
Meraca
Their highschoolers actually look like kids instead our highschoolers that have been pumped with horrible processed foods and hormones since 1st grade
It depends on where they purchase the cornbread from cornbread is good if it's made right. Unfortunately you got the bad testing one.
i feel bad for the arteries here.
I died at "are you lying?" "he's not lying"
That's it, I'm smoking a brisket this weekend!
I know those meat sweats were killer and the food coma of bbq the first time is out of this world
the children yearn for flavor
That corn bread did look kinda mid to be fair, if you do it right, put some butter/honey on there it is really good
Someone should bring BBQ to the UK.
The cornbread needed butter and honey. Watching the more sophisticated and well dressed young men chew on greasy meat bones is a kick! It was fun to watch them enjoy the food.
Yo what in the bloody hell is "Year 9 or Year 7??? 😂😂😂
Never had ribs??? 🤯
put barbecue sauce on sausage 😋
I love the headmaster😎😎😎
bro can you come to my school in malaysia but im islam so i cant eat pork pls come😅😅😅😅
It looks like it's medium rare, if you want it to be more juicy and tender cook it until well done
Why are these kids chosen? Is it a poverty thing? Lottery?
Even rewatching these vids, they makes me feel so happy. With the world as it is, these just show there is a common denominator. Food!  Not all is good, not all is bad.
Tex Mex, they need to try real Houston Tex Mex.
I have a real Texas BBQ joint in my city, and it’s absolutely delicious but prohibitively expensive. Worth it though! These boys didn’t even try the smoked beans or the peach cobbler! 😅
You guys should get a sponsor to send all these boys to the US.
Cornbread needs butter and honey
If you are not melting a little salted butter over your cornbread, you're doing it wrong. I love these kids reactions to my homestates BBQ. ❤
Bok
it's like giving a phone to a caveman, these poor kids have never even heard of seasoning
Where's the pico?
They make me so appreciative for our food here in the US.. I  love their reactions to our food !!!
Cornbread needs warm butter!!
Need to do Thanksgiving dinner
I'd love to see this in Texas with him saying the barking is the best part.
I am stupidly addicted to these videos. I love seeing people enjoy food, especially kids.  I do want to add that here in the states, we often use knives and forks when eating our barbecue. :>
god bless they don't like good mac and cheese lol
Make them try Rocky Mountain Oysters but don’t tell them what they are
Harry is such a great kid.  Very well mannered, and was in from the jump. "That looks lovely." (🥹 Boy, that's so nice to say, before you even tasted it.) He's having a life changing experience here, throwing his head back, and in total disbelief at the flavor. That kid and his family always has a place at my table. What a lad.
Fantastic addition of sammiches! Coleslaw, pickles and brisket!!! Fold for a mouthwatering  meal! Flavor explosion in your mouth. The only thing missing is chips.
BBQ Brisket! Nothing like it. I had a brisket sandwich in Colorado Springs, CO and from a local Louisiana BBQ restaurant the day before yesterday. Thanks for sharing Texas BBQ! I can hardly wait to chow down!
I feel bad because they have experienced this food, will crave it and won't be able to find it unless they come to the states.  I feel bad for them.
People don’t realize a REAL American doesn’t claim cultures we embrace them “Americans don’t have any real American food” yeah we’re a melting pot I always say as an example it makes me super proud we won the last Olympic chess medal with all Chinese American girls lmao , that’s what America is embracing other races and cultures , just like the food here is boom a foreigner comes starts cooking their food and slowly over generations it becomes its own thing 💪🏻 love this video because it shows we do our thing in that kitchen lmao
british kids tasting seasoning for the first time like a blind man seeing for the first time
so glad i didnt kms ahahahh this is my fav content
"Its like eating a crouton" honestly.... yeah lol
You have to lather the cornbread with Butter! :)
I dont get it.The British Empire was around a long time before the US became a country and they never ever even thought of trying stuff like this??? What is wrong with you UK???? Get your food act together mates! :)
I just feel bad for all those kids I got to try that barbecue you know they’re Jones and for the rest of live so they make it to the US
❤
In kansas city area a lightly seasoned beef slab is roast baron of beef pretty good
why do they gave a better vocabulary than me 😭
That one guy must've gotten held back a couple years
Butter and honey on cornbread, don't eat it dry.
You do not wait 16hrs for brisket, you cook it 16 hrs before you want it.🔥
I'm jealous of these kids man 😭
Just introduced to the itis.
I love these kids
Corn bread is better with honey as a condiment over it.
They should all visit North Carolina and Texas :)  I never knew that the UK didn't have pickles!
I 100% get it with the cornbread.  I almost feel like if they had it "done up" with whole kernels, cheddar and jalapeños mixed in the batter their opinion would be different.
I love that their eyes just light up when they eat food with flavor for the first time
Wow. Fussy bunch kids
Now I get it. He's not nine years old, he's in year nine. British school system is a bit different than the Swedish. Sorry! 😵‍💫🇸🇪
Mack 9 years old??? He's at least 14-15.
𝙲𝚊𝚗 𝚢'𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚖𝚢 𝚜𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚕 😂
So I’m an American and I can honestly say that I think every other country is to eat to survive while Americans are to survive to eat
Are the two blonde boys (they didn't show the names this time) brothers, perhaps twins? We need to know!
yoo I am genuanlly like in shock at their faces when they eat the brisket I like it but like not like that so lovley to see
DO FILIPINO FOOD NEXTTT
i also HATE cornbread as well (and coleslaw)
give them soul food
Wanting Mac n Cheese to be more bland is wild son!
We eat a kot of BBQ and I can honestly say Ive never seen an I one go after it like these guys did!
As a Texan I thought it was so funny when that kid kept saying it’s lovely😂
The English have a lot on us Americans, but food is not one of them lol
I have a question, which high school is this? I would like to go!!!
Show them eating Easter/baby shower meatballs
if only they knew how much money all this brisket is lol
Why do they always forget to put honey and butter on the cornbread and you don't eat cornbread by yourself it's either with beans or with meat or with the potatoes and gravy
This must be Terry Blacks
They needed butter or honey for the cornbread. Yum😊
The crack of the skin of a good sausage..  damn.
Jalapeno honey cornbread for more flavor.
You needed a ton of butter right in the middle of that cornbread. That’s what gives it flavor.
butter your corn bread add a little honey too
These poor kids don't get to experience this on a regular basis. That's sad.
thanks a lot now i’m hungry af 😭
You don't go to Texas for burnt ends, you go to Kansas City who invented them. Texas stole them but theirs are not as good still. Need that KC rub and if want sauce the thick Molasses sauce. Burnt end capital of the world. Regular brisket I think Texas and KC about the same, Texas has bigger portions KC better sauce. Both beef towns, I have ordered ends in Texas, but not the same.
As a GRIT (a girl raised in the south), we had this type of dinner every other weekend, 4 the holidays and special occasions. My favorite is the brisket and sausage.
They look like actual kids but in america they look like grown ass men😭
Please don't invite next time mr. Cornbread.
Ok, guess I'll book another flight out to Texas!! lol Love watching their reactions
Brisket is my favorite meat. This kids will crave this from now on!
We don’t eat our beans on toast kids lol
Guys where is this from btisket pls
Now don’t make fun of us being fat! We have great food in the US we can’t help it lol
Texan, born and raised, here.  Absolutely LOVE this video.  Another gem of a BBQ pit is a pork butt (actually part of a shoulder, I think).  My husband smokes his for 16 hours or so and we pull it for some of the best pulled pork sandwiches you've ever had.  Tip- If y'all ever give the kids cornbread again...give them honey cornbread with butter.  It's not that dry, crumbly stuff my great-grandparents would eat with buttermilk.  Buttered, honey cornbread is the way to go!
Get these kids some napkins
There is something about watching the pure joy and unadulterated enjoyment from watching people trying new foods
These look like middle schoolers for sure
Feel so bad for ppl who don’t live here 😂🙏
As A Texan! Thank you
I’m from the south, I could care less about the cornbread too!
Don't eat BBQ all the time just for special occasions my advice.
I don't talk about beans on toast... Dont' talk about my cornbread... Because you didn't eat it with homemade chili and some cheese on top
Please note slaw on (pork) bbq is Carolina.
I have questions about the smoke ring, also, pickles, white onion, and BBQ sauce?
I always wondered why they don't have brisket in England. I've heard them say that before. I love to see them enjoy real flavor....😂
I react like them every time and I’ve had our BBQ about 5000 times lol
The headmaster is my favorite guy in this series LOL
Corn bread is meant to be eaten smothered with butter.
Guys, you forgot when you have cornbread in America, you never just eat a plain. It’s horrible. You gotta add butter. The cornbread gotta be hot then you gotta have melted butter on it and it is crazy good.
I lived in San Antonio for a few years,  but I grew up in Maine. I had the same reaction to Texas BBQ for the first time, and every time since if im being honest 😂  Edited to say that brisket needs sauce!
Just one warning; supermarkets in Texas often offer mobility scooters for customers too obese to walk.
We now have a new generation of kids who are going to spread the wonderful tradition of American BBQ.
im just now realizing that no one is going home and enjoying their home cooked meals the same anymore 😭
Aaaand this is why we’re fat. Once you have it it’s hard to go back to
Imagine these kids going home having to eat regular brit food again?
I’m pretty sure these boys all grew an inch after all that meat and joy… and I wouldn’t be surprised if the headmaster went home and impregnated his wife after that 😂 that’s how much joy they have (bbq is amazing)
They dont have pickles?
11:52
Cracks me up you saying how big a bite of food coming from you two overfilling your mouth 😜
"Oh, you want it be more bland?" both boys, "Yeah." The most British thing I've ever heard.
mack is gonna be the next armond
Ahhhh, I say this with no disrespect but finally these kids can have some food with seasoning for once!
Hey I see Mammoth Mountain long sleeve shirt. I used to snow ski there in California.
the smaller kid with the curly hair fell into a food coma.= )
Headmaster needs a  raise
Well, at least now they know why we are a little on the fluffy side 🤣
Would be great to see JOLLY do an episode of Texas Terry Black's BBQ, and an episode of Biscuits and Sausage Gravy with the some cooks from the Royal Marines and cooks from the Royal Navy. Maybe these cooks will give it a try in their Mess Halls on their bases.
I can hear the national anthem gently crescendoing as the video progresses.
Try cornbread mixed together with milk!
Honey butter on cornbread makes it so much better.
Meat sweats incoming.
Just goes to show America is the best!
Field Trip to Texas LOL
I love how enthusiastic the twins are about every item they try.
🇺🇸🇬🇧💪🏼❤️
I’m sorry to say it UK; but you guys do the Coronation Anthem far too slow. It’s gotta be like 88bpm
"Its like steak times a thousand "😊
Imagine those kids who don’t get to eat this and have to eat regular school lunch
I am from Hong Kong so i never tried these food but seeing their reaction i really wanna try it out now
Don't forget to warn them about the itis 😴
London is lost
Lol, I actually got an ad for Kraft Mac-n-Cheese right when they started eating mac-n-cheese. 😂
As big as the British empire once was it's always surprised me they have such bland food
I have to agree with the kid on the cornbread not a fan myself  but the bbq looks delicious
For the record, no one eats cornbread by itself. Btw, sweet cornbread is disgusting.
Hilarious they all automatically put beans on the bread, when no American would ever do that straight off. I went to college in Australia. I'd never heard of beans on toast before, but quickly learned that single men of any age basically lived on it.
Feed them Mexican food!!!
Harry looks like goob from meet the robinsons 😂😂
Imagine a brit with a souther drawl 😂
How on Earth could they never have had ribs before? What are they doing in England just throwing them away or give them to the dogs?
I think I might smoke a brisket this weekend.
I must be British because I love pickles in almost any form
OMG Josh is a massive tool. Laughs everytime anyone says ANYTHING!
every time i see them eat i wonder what its like to be them
i like watching these to imagine what these taste like even without having them in my life
My mouth is watering for the whole video
Watching them eat the pork ribs is pure comedy
This is one of the most wholesome things I've seen in a long time
Now let them try indian food...  Come on.
Is the food bland in the uk
Get them to try Louisiana food next, they’ll be speechless.
You’re Welcome
Where did the bbq come from?
The corn bread was crumbly and dry. Not a good amarican corn bread with a ton of butter
English food is like eating paper. Outside of English people who eats beans and bread
Why did this make me wanna suddenly watch anime?
Texan BBQ is one of my top ten comfort foods. So glad y'all can see why
Damn now I'm craving barbecue
Ribs aren’t better than brisket.
British hischoolers= all of them being half the age of a freshman
Harry really knows flavor...
Love cornbread
“I’m still comprehending the flavors.” Lol
I like mustard potato salad
If there’s one thing America gets right, it’s food. It’ll kill ya tho, so moderation is key. 😂
It's gorgeous but fat. Take care, don't kill yourself. Heart attacks  happen very often after large meals. That's the only thing. Other than that, looks tasty. That's the darkside of something like this. Don't eat too much: Greed kills
I've watched so many of these high schooler videos! These kids are great! However, I love the Headmaster ! That man loves everything I've seen him eat!!
Texan here -  Shame on you guys, you've just introduced food porn into these young boys lives; and created an impossible standard for their Mum's to follow. 🤣
I love that vocabulary😂😂❤❤
Gotta add butter and honey to warm cornbread!
lol
Everyone moving to Texas after this one lol
Sending ❤ and I wish a brisket  from Hartselle Alabama  Love your reactions 😂❤
What do they eat in their country?
As a person whos never liked baked mac n cheese it really is hit or miss for some.  My brother loves that so much, hed prefer my mom make him a personal tin instead of a cake. His birthday is also super close to Thanksgiving. So when our mother makes the mac, she makes a separate one for him.
If it looks like cake to you but then you taste cornbread, it has to be a bit shocking to the senses.  Although, as an American, I don't like cornbread on it's own either. But, add beans (yes you guys know all about the beans)and it becomes amazing. You already eat them with toast, try cornbread!
They are such well-spoken and intelligent young men.
Texas BBQ Brisket is the greatest invention of cooking brisket ever!!
What's his name
*sneak beef in every thing" naw we let you know
Not the HeadMasters first time is he's calling it Bark
That looks good bro
Now I feel bad for laughing lmaow
DO MARYLAND FOOD
man i feel bad fr vegans
Enjoy it gurl!!!
everyone knows carolina style bbq is > Texas boring dry rub
With cornbread it has to be all nice and warm with butter 😋
The thing about corn bread is it needs a good smother with butter and honey or maple syrup!
YUM!
Captain 02 of H.A.C.P.O.A, We need some cleaner generators over at southern biper 2
Why are the twins kinda...
Are we not gonna talk about how the first boy shoved that brisket in his mouth 😂 had me giggling
People can’t diss on American food bro 😂
These kids definitely needed a nap afterwards 😂
Cornbread goes with everything!
I feel david, when something tastes good you have to keep eating even if you're not hungry anymore. The real eaters have our backs. Real eaters, rise up!
Cornbread should either be used to sop up soup or eaten alone with butter and honey.
2:33 this makes me laugh so hard😂
I love cornbread without the corn
No offense, but I hate barbecue
Is this an all boys school?
I hope they got a good smoker for the school. These kids were great.
I presume the nearest thing we have to British baked beans is our Boston baked beans. HATE it. However, I like BBQ baked beans because they have some shredded beef in it.
For me, cornbread must be eaten first and with melting butter.
Alright bro he does not like 9
4:48 Mmmm dont forget the pickles
Im a pretty attractive girl so when i was serious about a guys id take him out to bbq cuz if he cant watch me slop down some Wet fatty brisket just Soaked in sauce and Slapped on some bread with a load of slaw and creamed corn and some pulled pork.... boy wasnt for me if he couldn't stand watching that meat massacre because whooo boy do i love Texas BBQ!
Where did the food come from?
Love it that the 9 year olds using the word Sublime. 😂
These videos make my heart smile bcuz our BBQ is truly unmatched
did they not put butter on the cornbread?
As a Texan I'm enjoying this. The secret is slow smoking using oak wood like Pin or Post oak. For 14 to 20 hours also the rub to get that bark
The high schoolers are the best reactions 😂 We make awesome barbecue in america YUM 😋
Can I be there?
Misleading information again.. Just because you were served sweet tea doesn't  mean everyone will drink their tea super sweet..some people will take a half and half, that is..  half sweet, and half unsweetened.. some will even have unsweetened ice tea..  not everyone in the south will have the super sweetened tea as you were served... then you return back to the UK and assume everyone in the south drinks their tea as you served it.. That's ludicrous
If you guys bring Headmaster Dave on a tour to the US to see where these things are made, I will gift 10 channel memberships on the day that video gets posted
Very wholesome
That’s what happens when you brought up on food that has no taste
I feel sorry for those kids. They've spent the day in bbq heaven, and will go home to Beans on toast😢
2:31 Are u lying he’s not lying 😂
There 9 and in highschool 😭
JIFFY cornbread...... You will thank me later!
Smiled through the whole video. As a Texan, this did me proud!
Headmaster was in heaven lol
the "my eyes are watering" says is it all...this poor kid has not lived until THAT moment.
I like watching these. I would like to see how school girls would act.
As a Texan I like when they are like ohhh my it makes me want to laugh 😊
If they cook it there, who cooks it, especially what has to be slow cooked on a smoker?
It’s so cool they do this for the kids
I have to agree with them on the cornbread. It looks like Jiffy corn bread mix. Fry them some corn bread fritters in bacon grease. Slather on some sweet butter.
Ive never met someone who doesn’t say that TX BBQ isn’t the best thing they’ve ever eaten, That food can turn vegans into carnivores
We love making our cornbread with chopped jalapeno peppers and a small can of creamed corn. That way you don’t have the dry taste when you bite into it.
Texas BBQ is the bomb
You just can’t beat good BBQ. Texas, Carolina, Kansas City. I love it all.
Making good cornbread is a skill.
I think my man at 2:43 had his first sexual experience. Lol.
Cracks me up !!
We need to see the headmaster tour the US
What school is this I’m jealous of them and that teacher
I love the headmaster and his enthusiasm for all of it 😂🥰
Texas born and raised, never heard it called a Texas fold, but love it 🤣 we just call it a bbq sandwich
Bro gonna start a war over cornbread
These poor children have been starved of flavor for their entire life and now they are finally getting a taste of pure joy good for you for providing service to them
Yeah 😂buddy Texas has only the beeeeest barbecue, brisket, steaks and fixins! And don't forget the buttery bisquits and our sweet Texas tea
I want to see the alternative British timeline where America struggles with the great depression so American southerners immigrate to Britain and start BBQ shops taking the place out curry shops.
Where did you guys find American BBQ like this in the UK?  Or, are these simply British kids at a British school in the US?  Just curious.
is this what meals are like when you own 1500 acre texan homesteads?
Yall did cornbread dirty 😂 gotta put some diced pickled jalepenos as well as some of the juice from the jar in the batter
Imagine wen dey taste black people bbq😂😂
Is there a dietary rule in Britain instilled in the very young to never eat part of anything bigger than your head?
Is British food really that bad?  If prepared correctly, yes...
Watching these kids enjoy all that meat is giving me the meat sweats.
"it tastes like steak but smokey" ...well... it is smoked beef...
And yet they still put the baked beans on the bread lol ❤
If youve ever wondered why americans are so fat, this is why
You def made the tea wronf it’s supposed to be a lot darker
YOU HAVE TO PUT BUTTER ON THE CORNBREAD!!!!
Clearly from his message at the end he's never tried jalepeno cornbread ar cornbread with butter and honey.
this has to be your best segment.....this brotha from Los Angeles, CA by way of Texas approves of the you gents review
The rest of the world says we have no culture. This is a perfect example of what we bring to the proverbial table. Sure, bbq may not have started in the states, but we have PERFECTED IT!!!!
as a houstonian, i don’t know what these kids are talking about when they say they don’t like cornbread. just throw a slab of butter on some fresh cornbread, and it literally melts in your mouth
Makes me appreciate what we have compared to Britain.
“Meat sweats” city 😂😂😂
As a Texan I must agree with these young gentlemen. Our BBQ is lovely!
The 2 kids faces when they said pickles says it all😂😂
The headmaster just takes it over the top. Love it ❤
that cornbread isn’t how we in the south make it.
British people like beef. Shocker. 😂😂😂
The cornbread needed butter
The cornbread needed butter
The cornbread needed butter
No. That is not a Texas fold. That is called "a sandwich".😅
Texas BBQ is different than all other southern BBQ.  I lived in South Caolina for 23 years and now Texas for 7 years.  Its different.
I feel sad not being the one tasting all that food
13:38 so after eating all of this you need some really dark greens like fresh spinach and some other leafy greens that are not water only. Because you're going to need the roughage from it and you're going to need something to help with the two Suite of tea. Most of us over here who are healthy conscience do not eat a very heavy meal and then have sugar on top of it because your body's already going to make sugar out of what you just eaten so when you eat the roughage in this case scenario it will actually make it so that your blood sugar doesn't continue to spike extremely extremely high and it will provide antioxidants to help offset the sugar not perfectly but better than nothing else
10:54 Just don't forget the side salad LOL you're going to need the roughage 🤣
8:01 has to be used to sop up greases and juice.
7:24 and its waay more healthy. Good for the testosterone especially with lotsa vinegar for cutting greasyness.
The teacher is so damn funny
Why is my YouTube suddenly speaking Chinese?
I love that the headmaster has the tastebuds of an American.
They're all moving here to the US 😅.
It's funny, because if they think Texas food is good, they would lose their minds over Kansas City bbq. The capital of the world for bbq.
The meat is good but no bbq sauce. Personally I’m a fan of sauce sweetened with honey
I love these so much 😂
This is one of the greatest concepts I have seen on YouTube❤
This is why we’re over weight in America we cook too damn good 😂😂😂
Sublime😂😂😂
these brown kids dont represent british
dip the cornbread into a bowl of chili con carne
*'MURICA*  🦅
What I would give to be one of these kids bro
Now they know first hand why we are so fat. Lol
Bet it’s better than spotted dick and haggis!! I know haggis is Scottish but close enough!!
I m hungry
You've got to put butter and honey on the corn bread.
As a Texan from Beaumont, this makes me so happy to see. I knew they were gonna love how juicy that brisket was, and I was looking forward to how theyd react when the rib slid off the bone (you know its godly when you see that happen!)  *Side note: I wonder how they'd like Cajun cuisine!
The two boys gasping reacting to pickles ❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂
The headmaster is always my favorite 😂😂😂
So good
I think Cornbread deserves a mulligan.  It looked kind of dry and should not taste like paper, it should be moist and sweet.
Southern Mom Tip: As a child, I hated cornbread, I thought it was dry and nasty. So my mom would serve the cornbread hot with melted butter and a swirl of honey.
These brits went STRAIGHT to the bread one they got them beans in fork. The only one I didn't see go to the bread was the one that doesn't like beans
American beans on toast is bbq baked beans on corn bread
British people after experiencing flavor:
I have never heard bbq described as sublime.
pov when you lived in Texas😏
American tacos
Best thing about being Texan... That food we have here. I'd love to move but I know I'd never get brisket anywhere else like I do here.
I love the pure 😊 joy! So nice to watch.
Their reaction, their mannerisms, and the way they speak, and most importantly, the way they react to the food brings me great joy❤
I am from the deep south and hate sweet cornbread. Cornbread should be made with buttermilk you never need sugar. Cornbread is used to sop up the pot liquor from collard greens and for speckled butterbeans, blackeyed peas and giant limas.
They should have done the sides first, then the meats.  As always, the meats tend to set too high a bar for the sides to meet or come close to. That said, I really like these videos!
Needs honey on cornbread
Southern BBQ and Texas BBQ is different.
why we never see girls only see boys why we never see teachers also
Petition to make a food show where they go around the world to have food with the headmaster
This video is exactly why I pay for Wi-Fi. These gentlemen might be the cutest people I've ever seen. I loved their personalities and the way they eat!
I’m so proud of you guys NOT telling them that the “skin” on the sausage is actually intestines 😘
You’re the funny one 🤣🤣🤣
Loved the kid calling out texas to stop making corn bread hahahaha
Obvious we need to serve Texas BBQ at state dinners
Corn bread without butter and honey is a crime! 😂
You MUST put butter on the cornbread before eating!
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I envy them! I wish i could try that BBQ for the first time again!!!! Thank you Jolly for the wholesome content! In a world of evil warms my heart to see people just spreading cheer and joy! God Bless!!!
No one told them to put honey on the cornbread??
I'm convinced that Trump should fire all of our Ambassadors, replace them with pitmasters and make all of our embassies across the world BBQ joints. Love him or hate him, we'd have world peace next week and he'd have a peace prize by Christmas
British class field trip to Black's BBQ in Texas, with a long layover in Kansas City...
I'm a Southerner myself and I'm with that last kid on the cornbread, never did like it, im surprised they didnt include pulled pork
The young ones are tru savages 😂😂
You guys are pushing the boundaries of pleasure too fast and raising the bar for climax too high for their age.🤣
It shocks me that all beef sausage isn’t more common around the world
Warm milk over the cornbread with a small amount of sugar is the way to go.
Need to make sweet cornbread
"I'm still comphrending all the flavors" is the most British thing ever 😂.
That, my friends, is the taste of freedom
The pork ribs look like they were cooked too fast.
I wonder how they were able to get that type of food in the UK. Did they actually hire someone from Texas to cook it?
But why don’t they have genuine Texas bbq restaurants there 😢 everyone needs to experience just one of the thousands of different types of ways we enjoy our barbecue.
The "dont make corn bread" comment is a whole act of war right there...they obviously aint add enough butter
Well done to the team and everyone involved in this channel
Wow!
You know they had to take a nap after all that😂
I am from Texas and I don’t like the corn 🌽 bread ! Eww !
Why do all the kids look like they just got off the set of Willy wonka
Corn bread is very different from one part of the south to another. Crackling corn bread is the best. That's corn bread with bacon bits in it. Then there's sweat corn bread. Plain is kind of blah.
No grits as a side?
It’s crazy that they all just went straight to putting the baked beans on bread. You’re eating it wrong. You take whatever is on your plate after eating all your meats and you mix it in there. Makes a hodgepodge of delicious.
The cornbread needs to have plenty of butter on it. Then whatever cornbread is left over you turn into the most amazing croutons for salad the next day.
It’s crazy that they don’t make BBQ in the UK. They’ve been robbed.
These kids are going to tell their parents about this and the parents are going to say, 'it couldn't have been that good'
Texans know how to eat
I enjoyed watching this.
Who else is eating Brisket while watching this? 😌❤️
At least we don’t have beans with every meal
7:48 I'm from where the south meets the Midwest we say Howdy, Ope, and Y'all. I can't stand cornbread.
"have you not eaten in a week?" 😂 Teenage boys always eat like they haven't eaten in a week. 😂
Time to teach these kids what heartburn is!!!!!!!
As a Texan, this warms my heart lol. Come visit! There's more wild BBQ where that came from 😆
Wonder what cornbread they served for them to not like it. Need a sweet cornbread with all that bbq. With a spread of real butter.
I think Mack is Brad Pitt’s love child!! Handsome kid
Now you know why we are so “fluffy” over here.. 😂😂😂
The Headmaster is a foodie... I ld love to feed him
Do we need to know what year they are in?
Hope this was at the end of their day, they're all going to be in a meat coma after that.😄
Just wait until the meat sweats kick in!
Born 'n raised Texan here--- so nice to see y'all enjoy our staple dish! :-) Sending love and a Texas-sized hug!!!
SO glad these British Highschoolers got to try something of quality rather than all the low quality fast foods and junk foods they try in other episodes.  Texas fold....YEah!
One time I took a girl on a date to a bbq place and she didn’t tell me until we got there that the only thing on the menu she was willing to eat was Mac n cheese, come to find out she had never even tried bbq so I bullied her into trying a rib and it turned into one of our favorite restaurants that we would frequent weekly
As a Proud American of BBQ, I genuinely felt my heart grow twice as big from this moment 😂❤
Brisket is my favorite
@jolly:  Findlay , Vadim , Mack , Kavan and Harry are allowed to the cookout, bring these boys back and give them southern desserts
Its good that their first time trying it is done by these guys.  They'll never have it as good as this time.
I love these kids, they are so well spoken, funny beautiful manners. They have such interesting ways to describe the food.
To British people food with seasoning is like a godsend
It makes me feel good to see how much they are enjoying this new food. Im smiling
Why dont the Brits enjoy tastier food from around the world? Why keep bland?
❤
I literally just ordered brisket for dinner after seeing this video a couple days ago... I'm watching this while I wait for my food! 🤤🤤
"I don't even think I could eat food here anymore"
I cannot say I've EVER had a reaction like this to trying BRITISH foods as an american. XD
Groupings seem, oddly, segregated.
Nice Mammoth sweatshirt! I grew up in Mammoth and went to high school there. BTW, my mouth is watering right now.
Lol as soon as they're served beans they put it on bread
We like corn bread like you like beans. Weird I know.
I love the headmaster.... he has such a joy of flavors!
damn, they have to go back to beans on toast after this is messed up
Yes we Texans and southerners really enjoy our food.  BBQ is awesome.
As well as the outside casing of the smoked sausage snaps not cracks. Lol
FYI cornbread is to cleans the palate between different meats.
Don’t dwell on the sausage guys😂
We gained 100 lbs with this one
Omg these guys are sooooo adorable
When they hear the price they’ll know why it isn’t sold everywhere 😅
8:29 kid knows food elements lol
Love my BBQ ❤
You guys missed the BEST bbq - Eastern NC vinegar-based bbq!
You have to put BUTTER on the corn bread 😂😂
And on this day the whole school moved to Texas
Cornbread needs butter
how did you guys get this food to them 😭
Have to have honey with cornbread. 👌
For the corn bread, try with butter or some honey.
Not all of us Americans drink sweet tea. I much prefer unsweetened iced tea. Roses is my go to brand. It also makes awesome sun brewed tea.
You needed butter for the corn bread.
I forgot that they put beans on bread!  The tea is pure sugar!
I would love to know what the parents say about the videos.
They take the biggest bites; how can they enjoy the food.  Can they have forks and knives?
I hoke the kids mom doesn't see this video
Awesome video.😊😊😊😊😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊
We like putting honey on our cornbread
I love watching these kids enjoy brisket!
Always charming!
This kind of videos are definitely the worst nightmare for vegetarians kkkkkkkkkkk
As much as i loved England..the bland nature of meat there..in general ..it's  great to see these guys enjoying the flavor  of the various cuts..😂
The combination of the accent, the manners, the precocious mischievousness, the fact that the boys are obvious very articulate and honest characters of well-nurtured children makes these "British Highschoolers" videos just perfect.   It's interesting just how much they both echo and put a personal spin on Headmaster Smiths' presentation -- which is actually what happens with a good mentor.  The boys take the example of someone they look up to, and then make it their own.   Sorry, going a bit "Behavioral Psychology" on that one!  Suffice it to say there's not a single boy who doesn't present a wonderful personality and character and openness that makes me smile.
I love this channel!
The great thing here is that these students know how to speak well.
Is the headmaster the funniest or what??
My aunts recipe is half a picture of sugar and the rest is tea
They didn’t make the cornbread right because that should’ve blown them out of the water
I'm still compending the favours...Lol.
This makes me so happy as a Texan 😂
Is that fuckin Jojo Rabbit?
slop it up redcoats. This is what winning a war tastes like
Dear great heavens! Thy reaction is extraordinary! Thy is well jolly good thy wishes thy could munch at thy own abode!
Jail to the kid who said "never make cornbread again" the disrespect
Like the kids reaction.. but love the teacher's reaction better.. he just savors all the various dishes in all the videos... Imma get some BBQ tomorrow 9/7/25... That looked amazing..
This is kind of cruel. Now they know what good food tastes like & now they have to go back to British food
the meat is boujee! 😂❤
Outsider tarts could make these kids weep with joy
Outsider tart thanksgiving dinner with the pumpkin mac and cheese and all the sides including pearl onions cranberry sauce and roasted turkey
The pickle twins. I'm with you boys, best snack ever!
There's so many different types of cornbread that would have been acceptable as a representative of traditional cornbread. There's plain Jane from the box's instructions, which seeks to please everyone, but impresses a very few. Then there is the plain Jane that is sweet. It is still decent enough to keep itself alive as a recipe, but really out of place when it is too sweet.  Then there are the family variations that would substitute buttermilk, for the whole milk, and add creamed corn and sweet corn in to the mix. This would be a fair representation of corn bread made by people trying to please.  Then you would have the Texas varieties, and here are a few, you'd have the creamed corn and buttermilk, but also cheddar cheese, diced onion, diced red bell peppers, and pickled jalapeños.  Then you'd have a chili cornbread, made with the buttermilk, the cheddar cheese, and chili powder added, which is Ancho peppers, cumin, cayenne peppers, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, & salt.  That ancho pepper and cumin are the mysterious flavors many find hard to describe, and they are the signature components to the flavoring of canned Chili, chili recipes.
Cornbread needs butter, they might give it a 2 instead of 0/10
Sounds like the cornbread didn't have enough sugar.
Stop giving those guys dry cornbread. No one in America eats dry cornbread. Put lots of butter on it. Eat while it’s hot. You can even add honey or syrup if you like it sweet. Never never serve dry cold cornbread. 😠
NO! take it away he can have McDonalds
I would love to get a work visa and open a southern bbq joint in Uk
4:17 that man came a bit😂 he fell in love with
In my opinion, the cornbread was really dry. I love GW’s BBQ in Texas for their honey butter cornbread.
Evryfin's be'uh wif bred, innit.
I would love to eat with you guys
That's why we americans are so fat🤣
Why are they segregated?
Their response to ribs made me smile. Yes little europeans! THIS is what real carnivores feast upon!
As a Texan, I would say that brisket is not cooked enough. Very good slice of meat with that fat still on. Personally, I would add a lot more wet seasoning, aka the bbq sauce, and I’d cook it longer over a seasoned wood and use a foil wrap to keep it from burning as easily. Some burn is good but you don’t want to eat charcoal.
What I like is how the headmaster joins in the fun, too. The students won't be the only ones eating the delicious food, lol. 😆😆😆
Most people don't realize brisket is literally beef bacon. It's the same cut as in pork belly bacon...
How do you get Wendy’s to them if there is no restaurant
We kicked them out of this country once, we aren't afraid to do it again... Texas BBQ is all ours.
See Europeans This is why we are all fat
Head master heads to the USA .. I need to see that man experience more things lol
“Like eating a crouton”😂😂😂
that one kids life changed lol
Funniest thing on YouTube in a long time! The kids and the teacher's reactions  are so great!❤😂
@1:34 that umm and properly described wow
Hey Im from Portugal! I hope you like it here!
It's almost like food tastes better when it has seasonings beyond a pinch of salt 😂
We are so glad you enjoy our food. I am a Memphis man, and I was raised on top notch bar-b-que. It makes me truly happy to see that you all enjoy our cooking.
They were hating on that Mac n cheese!! I guess it had to be a line somewhere
You need butter and honey on the cornbread!!
Fave is the teacher having an experence
Poir kids, first time tasting food with taste. After all England isnt known for its cooking.
7:45 you NEED to have honey and butter!!! Just load it up full layer of both
If your cornbread is bland then it was made wrong. Did they make it without sugar? Did they put butter on it? Is it even warm?
Yall need to try big red soda ! All the times yall come to Texas I never see a big red or big red float
Why are the kids grouped by race?  Smh
If you think I’m going to pay 40 bucks to watch spoiled children complain you are way off .
Dave could sell socks to a snake with his enthusiasm !!   You MUST bring him to the US when it's safer to travel here !  And not just the South or Texas.  Proper 2 week road trip.
Old school Texas BBQ doesn't involve sauce... that's for tourists.  If the smoke doesn't "do" the flavoring, it's not done right.
The difference in these boys vs our boys in America…..we are doomed.
They are missing the pulled pork haha
Why do they eat the beans on bread? The beans should be eaten with the cornbread and the Mac and cheese should be combined with the meat
Was this food from Franklin BBQ in Austin?
Why is Brad Pitt there 😭😭
Sorry but as a big sweet tea person that looked really light
Why would you want your food more bland 😂
I truly believe us Americans make the best food. And that’s not me being cocky at all, this opinion is based on all the videos I’ve watched of reactions of foreigners eating American food. The way their eyes light up. 6:54 that music there, thats the taste of Freedom 🇺🇸 Boys lololol!!!
This is the moment theyve lived for XD. Nothing beats a nice grilled all beef hot link for those folks growing up on bangers, cumberland and brats in the uk. Its one of the rare/if any american sausages unlike the common pepperoni, Im sure some pop ups/pubs would kill offering the american all beef tx style hot link out there. The TX fold is a religious experience worthy of worldwide exposure. Beef ribs are a borderline religious experience bc youre in hell until you can get one in your hand again. Smoked beef ribs, tri tip, brisket+ends and the beef hot link Undefeated.
Dave’s wife needs to worry, cause Dave’s in love!!!
Sees beans and instantly scoops it onto the toast
Okay but what barbecue spot is this?!
Seeing how they’ve gone from tiny nibbles to try the new foods to just tearing into it is so sweet, they know it’s gonna hit every time
“ sigh” you’ve disappointed me 😂😂
Takes notes other states, this isn't Memphis BBQ, Kansas BBQ, Louisiana BBQ, North Carolina BBQ. THIS IS PROOF TEXAS BBQ IS SUPERIOR
Y'all are welcome in Texas any time - we'll cook for you!
British high schoolers: Here, have some flawless Texas BBQ  American high schoolers: EAT THESE BEANS ON TOAST  😂😂😂
Put some butter on that cornbread...😋
Harry looks like goob from the robinsons
Its the fact they like it more than I do...and I'm Texan.
They should try Hawaiian food now lol
this is why were fat lol
Have the exact same mammoth mountain shirt, LOVE FROM CALIFORNIA ❤️🤙🏾
Those boys need butter with that corn bread fellas!
He actually looks like Brad Pitt
There's something about this video that just makes me so happy. It's so wholesome
Okay…but the cornbread needs butter and honey.
HES RIGHT STOP MAKING NASTY CORNBREAD ITS FIN FOUL!
After eating that great tasting barbecue you ruin it with  corn cardboard nasty bread! CMON MAN!
A southern barbecue loving American i have to say i also don't love the Krispy top macn cheese. I much prefer it silky all the way through
Happy to see those kids having the most flavor they have ever experienced in their lives
Shirt off ..Weiner Out.  Pic #2 is beyooooooooooond crazy
That was like $1000 worth of barbecue 😂😂😂😂
I love cornbread, personally, but not bland cornbread.
Brits spent centuries trading with other countries only for them to spice their language 😂
Eating ribs somehow taps into our inner primal caveman
Did they try the cream corn?
How did you guys get that food there? 😂 Or it was probably made there huh?
Shoulda put some butter and honey on that cornbread.
I’m full just watching them eat
3:39 the simultaneous gasp of excitement! 😂
Im a vegetarian and even my mouth was watering lol
The cornbread needs to have butter all over it and heated up.
“I don’t even think I can eat food here anymore.”    The Best compliment.🤣
Forgot the pickled Jalapeños
texan born and raised, and i LOVE seeing people have texas food for the first time! whether it’s texas bbq, tex-mex, or anything else we offer in this huge state, like fried jambalaya balls or fried oreos or any other fair food! it’s just so fun to see people react to the crazy flavors we have down here.
Gotta slide them some of that buttery, sweet cornbread with the corn mixed in. Good as Hell.
they have been baptised
Cornbread is best with butter and eaten warm to hot 8:00
How do you make a steak like this in 16 hours? You put it in the oven while you sleep and in the morning when you wake up it's ready. Enjoy your meal!🤣
Such a torture to watch this video after work on an empty stomach from the opposite side of the world from US.
I wish I could be there and share this perfect food
I feel bad for those kids. The UK has literally the worst most bland food out of every country , they eat like they live in the 1800’s still 😂 get w the times baby !!!! No cultured , no good Mexican food , no Italian food , Asian food , mediterranean, Indian , no spices or seasoning 😂😂😂 just beans on toast or potato’s w beans & tuna 🤣
Why am I watching this at 2:30am?!!! I’m so hungry now!
let british kids try a gun range like american kids
cornbread with no honey butter is criminal that’s what ruined it for them
I love it Shout out from Houston Tx!!!
Finally they see what they are missing out on
For those who dont care for mac and cheese, have them stir in ketchup
Dude they’re so lucky to be able to try it for the first time lol I wish I could try it again for the first time
As an American I can confirm this was about what my first bbq experience was like, I was shockingly old before I first had it lmao
How messed up is it, that countries have been closed to everything America, like our PHENOMENAL beef. These kids wondering why they don't have this in the UK. Well, because American politicians have long since sold out the American people and all they have to offer the world, and flooded the American market with EVERYTHING from EVERY OTHER COUNTRY, while making US pay extremely high tariffs to buy all that crap we're importing, while not exporting ANYTHING the powers that be cannot make money on. Thank God Trump is fixing all that.
my question is how yall got the food there for them?
All these kids are such good commentators
British high-school boy try detroit pizza
British children tring detroit pizza
Your nice
You can see it in their eyes when they realize why our healthcare isn't free 😂
That  Texas fold reminds me of a Korean samm.
lol stuck in Alaska and now I’m super homesick for Black’s in San Marcos
They are going to fall asleep afterwards 😂.. as a southerner I loved the critique.. but you should’ve given them honey cornbread 😊
I lived in Texas for 4 years and I honestly miss the food till this day 😂   Texans don't play around when it comes to the food
Food is the ultimate unifier for different countries, cultures and societies. Watching these kids and their Headmaster lose themselves in edible bliss was outstanding.  This is positive golden content.
I'm not a fan of cornbread either at most places.
British kids not knowing how to use cornbread, no butter?  Not using it as a sponge to soak up the left over sauce on the plate?  Good day!
And this is why I think cultures should melt together, most of the items are all from different countries all around the world.
My Dad got a smoker for his birthday. It was a present for us all
what is highschool in the uk cause where im from my middle school is 7-8-9 and highschool is 10-11-12 but 9th is counted as highschool but you go to a middle school
I love seeing other people enjoy American foods and culture. Now we need some Americans to go to the UK and reciprocate! Or maybe you guys can show us around your country. Thanks for the wholesome content
They loook like their in year 5 ngl
As a Texan, I love every minute of this (and that brisket looks perfectly done! Great bark and fully rendered, got me drooling over here)
When he said it looks like “mud” I instinctively said “GROW UP” lol
its sad that brithish kid had never had the joy of eating a whole rack of ribs in one sitting
I just know vegans would absolutely ball their eyes out if they watched this😂
I said it before, I never thought I would find myself enjoying videos about British High Schoolers enjoying American cuisine so much, but here I am.  Also, I love at 3:40. Those two hear about pickles being present and it was like they were just told they won the lottery.
Bro as a texan these kids are acting so classy, like here, or anywhere in america, if food is bad we cuss at it and when its good we just say its ok.
I recently moved to Europe after living in Texas for a while and Ngl this video is actually making me cry I miss TX BBQ so much and it brings me so much joy to see these kids enjoying it
The headmaster is so chill like that
Peak food 😋
7:06 this kids reactions are fucking hilarious. Its like he’s drunk on meat
Wish they could try NEW MEXICAN food.
I agree with them about the cup of tea @13:10 it’s not tea it’s iced tea😂
This is why we’re BIG in America because ALL THE FOOD TASTES SO GOOD!!!! 🤤🤤🤤🤤
‘have you not eaten in a week’😂😂
Watching from Amarillo Texas here, love watching these kids enjoy our food! There are at least 9 barbeque places here, one of which is literally connected to a gas station chain, still some of the best brisket I've ever had. But im super glad to see other people enjoy it as well, makes my Texan heart proud lol!
This is torture.
I'm jealous! Texas BBQ is amazing!
The first bite with the bread gave that teacher the "I'm about to bust" face 😂
"When did so many Brits move to Texas Grandpa?".  Well it all started in 2025 with a video......
dude im watching this super hungry and all i have in the fridge is stuff you can put on bread 😭
Everytime it cuts to the principal I'm ready for him to scoop his plate into a to-go bag 😂
I love the full stop to disrespect cornbread! My wife LOVES cornbread. I'll never understand it.
If you want a really good way to eat cornbread, either drizzle a little honey or butter in the middle, or crumble it into some chilli.
Ad skip 5:14 6:03
I've heard people say that cattle in the UK are slaughtered older than we do in the US, and the fat and intermuscular fat are much more yellow, denser, chewy, and basically inedible.
Helping the British mind comprehend 🥲
TEXAS BABY  but setiusly its so funny when there like oh thats so nice and its like so wierd to me bc im texan and thats all  i have to say
you can see there all Americans by the end of the video lol😂😂😂
And Europeans wonder why Americans are fat. I smoke at least 1 brisket every 2 weeks.
Im from Texas. I love cornbread but, I never have it with BBQ. It doesn't mix well to me.
Did they even get butter on that cornbread? I didn't see any. No wonder it tastes bland and dry
13:40 Texan here. BOY! You won't be welcome down here with that tongue and disrespect to cornbread.
They couldnt chew it fast enough lol aww love it.
Just imagine how sick they’re going to be in the am
"Never make cornbread again"  Southerners : "So you have chosen death"
I can't stop watching these videos, these kids are funny...but that Mr Smith dude makes any video he's in. Seriously, jolly needs to be on Netflix.
i know that teacher moved to texas after this he loved absolutely everything😭
Welcome to America boys. The corn bread is better if they use cream corn while cooking it.
Jolly is doing the Lords work. Trying happiness and flavor from all over and bringing it back home.
Im a Texan, and i lived in London for a year as a 12 year old. The kids at my school literally thought we didnt have electricity and rode horses to school  💀
Texas has that unique blend of various cultural influences that just make BBQ work super well. German, Czech, Mexican/Spanish, African-American, etc. had a good part in this and that’s why it’s Amazing.
Nobody in Texas has ever used the term "Texas Fold". Absolutely not.
I love watching different cultures come together and appreciate each other. We don't need to fight all the time.
We all pretend we like cornbread
They need to try cornbread that is not like cake. Extra fine cornmeal  buttermilk an egg 1/4 cup oil and water peanut butter consistency pour into a preheated cast iron skillet into a 375 degree oven until a toothpick comes out clean. As the kid says “Sublime”!
I just smile, listening to the student’s comments. 😊
Bomboclat
Love
These boys are taking such huge bites 😂
These are honestly the best videos 🤣
They sold on the corn bread😅
I feel like every southerner was offended when he said never make cornbread again.
i came to this after the 13th short
You should do the same with American high schoolers and junior high students try British foods
I Like the British accent
I agree on the kids cornbread comment at the end. Yuck!
An old taste is , Cornbread and buttermilk, like cereal.
They're going to have a hard time eating Mom's cooking.😂😂😂😂
As an American, dont move to America. Not because we dont want you here, but because we dont want to be here either.
Why are Americans fat? Cause we got food like this😂
The British reaction to this is “lovely” while the American reaction is “DAMN GOOD”😂😂
Also that tea seems a bit light?
Where's the butter for that cornbread???
Gets to show everyone has a different pallat...except for the teacher lol 😂😂😂
Now they can see why were all SO FAT
What was the restaurant that made this food?
As a southern, who folds the bread? You just make a big ole sandwich
Those kids are so damn cute!!!! Glad they appreciate American bbq!!
Wait the UK doesnt do pickles?
Yummy
HOUSTON TEXAS!!!!!!!  Love the video. Texas food goin global. Love these kids and their reactions to flavor 😂😂
If we could just force feed this to vegans...😮
Now you see why Americans are overweight. The food is too good 😂😂😂
Now EVERYBODY gets why we're so deliciously fat in the US. Why didn't they give them the sides with the meat and wait until they had finished? You can't just eat the sides without the meat.That was such an odd choice...
There you go- somebody go do Texas bar b que in Britain and get RICH!!! If I could smoke, I would do it today. PROMISE.
4:20 lmao how many autobiography titles will he have??? (like his last one for five guys was "everything is better dipped)
Who made the cornbread? Also, if you don't like mac and cheese, somebody made it wrong, and same for the baked beans smh
why hasnt anyone done a channel like this with british food
I love this video so much
I love watching the little curly haired boy who just thinks every bit of this is wonderful and lovely!!❤
These kids are hilarious!! 😂
“American is really go big or go home, isn’t it?” 😂 he’s not wrong
And that was just a couple kinds of BBQ! There are literally hundreds more types and flavors out there and they are all unique and delicious in their own way! Us Southerners are serious about our BBQ!😂
USA USA USA
According to my American father, “People always say brisket is so hard to make, really you just season it, and throw in the smoker overnight.”
See these kids loving some American cuisine makes my heart warm and fuzzy ❤ these guys are awesome
Have any Brits tried smoking their meats in the UK? Seems like a great business venture waiting to be explored.
This might be my favorite video on the internet
I love everyone in the video thank you for trying this food
We Americans don’t have a lot to be proud of atm but our food is unrivaled
The bark 😂
Harry looks and sounds like younger version of Goob from Meet the Robinsons
This is our food but dang kids here would not eat so much in one go!  Ugh. But yes we know our BBQ.
Feeding them Texas BBQ and not warning them about the food coma they will be in later is wild. 😆😆
I also detest the crispy bits on top.  The crunchy cheese and noodles on the side are the best!
As a native Texan, this makes my heart smile
you always eat cornbread with butter
Year 7 Harry is so adorable
I kept seeing shorts of clips from this in my feed. After seeing a bunch of them, I finally caved in and said out loud "Alright FINEE ill click the video link.."
Headmaster cracks me up 😂
10:08 please tell them what the skin is and react.
4:48 did he just call cole slaw, cole floor or cole flower?
Us Americans live for BBQ
They're so cute! ☺️ I'm glad they enjoyed it. I love me some BBQ, now! 😋
Gotta slather the cornbread with some jalapeno butter.
I feel bad that they might not even have it again :(
My son lives in Austin. Which restaurant did you go to? So glad you'll are in Beef Heaven as we are!!
Even in Texas, beef is not the default for sausage. Many people prefer all beef hotdogs, but they aren't the most common, and most other sausage is pork. You can certainly find beef sausage but not everywhere and it's always more expensive like a specialty.
The boy wants jiffy lol
Why can't I be these high schoolers😭😭😭
The 7 year old needs his own show or movie. Lil bro a natural comedian.
This is what's great now with being one international community! We get to experience other cultures and share our own ideas. Switch things up and add to things.
67
When my brother-in-law came to the US for the first time to meet our family, we took him out for southern BBQ and his mind was blown 😂 he has to have it everytime he visits
This is a cruel form of torture, they know those flavors are out in the world but likely won’t experience them again anytime soon.
Seeing Brits just go straight in with their hands. GAWH YES!!! GO IN!! BBQ is MEANT to be eaten with your hands.
Cornbread definitely needs to be made with sugar, and I think that's why they didn't like it.
as a vegetarian...I WISH I COULD EAT THIS FOOD SO BAD haha it looks so good. they look so HAPPY 💛 my heart is happy because they're so happy. this is when you know the seasoning is so importanttttt. YUM.
I love the “that’s lovely” every time the kid tries some new food
Brisket is insane ❤
KC and Memphis BBQers seething!
The corn bread has to be the honey corn bread
The kid who doesn’t like cornbread or mac-n-cheese…he’s a replicant and must be marked for reprocessing!
I’m on a diet and this is so not helping
You need to put honey on the cornbread
Watching British prep schools kids try all these amazing foods is especially satisfying for a few reasons. 1- theyre extremely respectful, well spoken, and also open to trying new foods.  2- living in a place not known for their cuisine, you know theyve been deprived of so many delicious foods from all over the world.   I take for granted that i can find literally any type of cuisine here in the Bay Area, California. Hearing these kids say things like. "Ive never had ribs before" just blows my mind. The Korean food series was awesome, too. Their food is so good, and none of them had any experience at all with Korean food.
You guys should’ve did sweet cornbread for them. They probably would’ve liked it.
Cornbread n bbq sauce
I love how wide their eyes go wide when they experience flavors for the first time
I’m hungry                             “IN A MINUTE!!”
There is not a person on this planet that doesn’t smile ear to ear when they get that first bite of Texas BBQ. The ultimate comfort food. If you’re eating Texas BBQ you know you’re in good company.
I love corn bread by itself. But I will say when I was growing up  alot of people ate cornbread in a glass of milk like a sweet cake. I never liked it but a lot of other people did
Put butter and honey on the corn bread.
British people are more used to simple food. It's interesting to see their response to American food.
Funny to see them but their bean on bread. No surprising, but still funny.
I hope and pray at least some of that was mesquite-smoked, it wouldn't be true Texas barbecue without it.
A black person didn't make that cornbread that for sure.
😲😃😁pickles🥒
So someone clearly cooked that for them, so there must be a BBQ restaurant near where that school is?
They don't have pickles in the UK?
love seeing these kids reactions  to our food lol
I'm a Texan and find it very complementary to hear and watch these British folks enjoy Texas BBQ so much.  It IS food of the Gods, and those who cook the best BBQ put years of experience, hard work and love into it.
Am so jealous man..
I am imagining my sons when they were in high school. They would have devoured all the meats! Did these boys have to go back to classes? They’d probably be stuffed and want a nap! 😂
They should have fed their Mexican cornbread. Much more flavor.
It should be a crime to call that " southern Ice tea!" True southern tea would be dark enough that you wouldnt see the straw in it.
Do soul food!!!
These kids look at least 11 not 9 i was like wtf 9!
You come to America you'll weigh 400 pounds in a month 😂
Poor British people not being able to enjoy this on the daily. All they have is toast and beans😢
I had no ideal the English were BBQ deprived.
Texas fold?? This is the first time this very old Texan ever heard of it. Might be tasty, though.
How's you'er Cafeteria food like, after this?
Dont start with the burnt ends. The rest of the experience will never compete! Lol I love the reaction.
Food looks amazing and makes me wanna say I’m Texan so I could have this often, but do I wanna trade my ability to drive when there’s 2 mm of snow?😂
Dudes corrupting them
Y’all have to do cornbread and milk
Give them cornbread with butter and honey,
Which Texas restaurant did you get that brisket from?!!
Those boys have a range of adjectives for the dishes. And the Principal - he's so appreciate of all food. Love love love this
Sublime
It's like feeding a Victorian child they'll never feel the same
Why some black kids have to share among three students, where as white kids only have two per group.  Tv you need to be more sensitive in this area
As an American, when it comes to the south, they know how to cook food right
1:25 aint no way the kid on the right is 9 years old 😮
harry is such a great kid like idk why but watching him eat it and enjoy it so much makes me so happy
They said no corn bread, and quite frankly I took that personal...no honey, no jalapeños.
You use the cornbread to soak up the meat juice on the tray to hydrate the cornbread
I will say this how do you give them cornbread without butter on it?
You guys are absolutely killing me    I live in Pennsylvania and I’ve never had this.  50 years old I’ve never had this.    I just wanna cry. lol  wow, it looks good
Look at that, we beat your colonial asses and still feed you. That’s southern hospitality.
It’s amazing what happens when British people actually try real food…
Brits know their sausages. If they give the seal of approval then it's legit good.
Slap some butter on that cornbread! A must!
This has to be the worst for these kids when they eat good food from the US and they can't run out and get it after
I love that they were mostly skeptical of the Mac and cheese and immediately put the beans on toast 😂😂
God I love my state.
need some butter on the cornbread
The pickles ruin it oo 😂 Child of West Africa for sure
02:51 the cheek on this kid :D  love it
George cooper would be proud .
We didn’t invent bbq but we do it the best and I’m glad they had such a good time enjoying it
Anyone else notice when that kid said “I don’t think I can eat food here anymore” he lost his accent. He is already priming for his move to the states 😂
Nice to see that teenage boys are bottomless pits worldwide😂
Oklahoman here, understood. Sending brisket now. Also glad I’m not the only one who isn’t huge on cornbread- I get the concept but it’s never worked that way for me, so I’m not a big fan.  This platter looked so good though. Definitely getting bbq for dinner this week.
Must not have been sweet corn bread.  It does make a difference
definitely need louisiana cuisine!!
I mean I’m not eating brisket everyday, but some sort of beef or pork, 100%. Pork ribs and bbq pulled pork is like an every other day thing.
It's so funny how I agree with them on the Mac and cheese 😂 I love it it's one of my favorite foods but I'm not a fan of this style, it's so rich it upsets my stomach and I don't like the texture of the usually overcooked pasta with the crunchy bread crumbs
Seeing they include the staff too is cool. I only saw some shorts of this prior, so watching a full vid is cool.
They didn’t put honey on the cornbread that’s why some of them don’t like it.
cornbread is supposed to be sweet
America #1
Flavor lasts with seasoning, that’s what’s happening, why are you so shocked?
Is all the food in these videos made in the UK or do you take it back from the US and warm it up
The uk is gone, the king and parliament sold it to the muslims
I’m hungry now!
so. i know what my next business will be!
you missed the diced jalapenos in the corn bread with a dusting of grated cheddar on top and soft butter to spread.
I love the headmaster!  We need to see more of him.
I love their reactions. David: "It's absolutely sublime!"
I have been to England. The food is bland.
I wasn't crazy about beans as a kid but love them now. Some of these kids will grow into additional foods and flavors.
All this video has done is make me want Texas barbecue!!!!
Just cut to the headmaster, we all love that guy!!
The children yearn for flavor
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore." 😂
Suppose to lather butter on the cornbread
Just curious - why didn't you serve the cornbread with some honey butter?
Beans and corn bread…. It’s a staple in the south!
So.. Back to those underfunded school meals every other day.
You never eat corn bread alone. You put butter and honey in it
what sublam?
"Ho my god that just malted in my mouth"😂
English people are so Classy and Cool ! Big Respect from Tennessee USA
Give them soul food. They need cornbread from a soul food shop….wont be calling that bland.
Paul Revere really saved us from eating British food
This is what will heal the world lol
Omg these kids wouldn’t know good food if it slapped them in the face
The teacher is just blown away every time
1:20 2:25 2:36 4:15 6:50 7:35 8:50 10:00 11:00 12:05 13:05
David looks 14
They do not look like there age
Why the kids always posh harry potter type bellends ???
Poor kids can taste the freedom in every bite hahaa
Needed to have actual corn bits in the cornbread and a little cheese also. Then some honey for on top of it.
I would love to see american kids trying what these kids usually eat 😂
Now cornbread in texas is sweet not bland that isn't texan cornbread
It's would be so wholesome as a chef(pit master) and get all these reactions
This makes me think of when your parents tell you not to eat from the neighbors. 😂😂😂This is how we be eating at the neighbors
I can understand what they mean when it comes to cornbread. Cornbread is one of those items that you'll either love it or you won't care for it. But I'm glad more folks love it than don't like it. I enjoy it myself, especially with some pit beans or ranch style beans.
Poor kids;  they were unfortunately born in the Land of Bland.  Bless you for blessing their lives with FLAVOR!
Spread butter on the corn bread.
You should have spread butter inside the cornbread when it was still hot.
I feel sorry for Brits and their lack of good food.  😂
The thing about the sides like Mac n cheese corn bread collard greens  baked beans coleslaw etc. is that you mix them with the bbq sauce and meat. Much like the texas fold
If there's one thing that Americans, Canadians, and Australians all have in common, it's that we all love to grill food outdoors.
It's precious how much of a great time they're all having :D
They might like some of the food they don't now when they get older.
We need to import however these kids are being raised and educated.
They should have my mom cook for them, her cornbread is absolutely heavenly 🤤
Those young men have been scarred!! 😂😂. If you don’t get emotional, then it wasn’t cooked right!😂 That’s how we get down here!! 👏🏾
its like cavemen discovering fire
Cornbread needs butter or honey on it
they ain’t gonna like it when they see the prices
To be fair cornbread with the corn in it with a drizzle of honey on top will change their minds😂
My favorite quote: "I don't think I can eat here anymore"
These poor sweet babies don’t know what to do with seasoned food. 😂😂😂 I love these videos. I do agree with them about the crumbs on top of Mac and cheese. I don’t like them on top either.
4:20 factssssssss
You should give em gumbo or if you can crawfish Louisiana style
13:37 Head master gets it. I’ll take one, but I ain’t finna make one for myself
Making me hungary (get it?) even though i am actively eating.
the children yearn for flavor
That cornbread did look a bit dry, gotta drag it through some honey butter.
“At what age can you legally move to America?”   “Are you lying?….he’s not lying”  “That’s lovely”  “My mouth is mesmerized”  😂😂😂  I feel you bro, I feel you
The kid doesn't understand the the south loves cornbread
Time to move to Texas!! 😂😂😂
Okay seriously how dare you insult a good brisket like that, it's not burnt it's cooked to Perfection it's supposed to look like that it's just seasoned and slow cooked for hours on end you philistine.
Obesity 101
Best way to eat Cornbread - with lots of butter!
This makes me SO grateful to live in Alberta. Lol, if you're gonna be stuck in Canada, you may as well live in Cold Texas. I love me some smokehouse bbq.
British people y’all need to cut out the beans and toast and come over here and get some country barbecue Classics and some soul food will fix you up real good
God Bless those kids 😂❤… they get to experience the very things that make us “healthy” in America 😂❤ They’re making me hungry! ❤❤
They all about to move to America for the Texas BBQ
Cornbread needs a slightly melted pat of butter!
The cornbread needs butter spread on it and honey also improves it.
Forgot i watched this 2 months ago, lol. Watching people enjoy something you enjoy just hits different. Like an inverse schadenfreude (looking up the term for that later).  Btw if anyone is here and wondering how one could eat so much food in one sitting, the answer is: You don't! Leftover culture is pretty common in the U.S., especially If you go out to eat at a sitdown restaurant. It's pretty standard to have a little (or a lot) for later.
You have to put butter on the cornbread.  Definitely adds to it.
I think my cornbread is top tier 🤷🏾‍♀️😂 it’s not dry or bland
Should have crushed the kids dreams by explaining that Texas is run by a bunch of religious zealots and going there is essentially putting your life at risk.
His energy makes me so happy just from watching him
No butter on the corn bread?  That ain't right.
I wonder if any of the kids got sick from consuming all that meat!
i want  to be part of this show just for the food
How are they in highschool they look like their 8 years old
The kid who said that cornbread feels like eating paper I going to make sure he doesn't make it to adulthood
The Headmaster needs a trip to Texas! 😂
Josh and Ollie, you guys need to flip the script and have American kids try British food. Lmao!
It’s so hilarious to watch these kids react to the different kinds of Texas barbecue.  As a huge fan of great barbecue, it’s so satisfying to watch them discover the wonderful flavors and textures of the different kinds of meats and how they’re prepared, as well as the side dishes. 😊
The Headmaster is the star of all these reviews.
They needed baked beans to dip their cornbread in.
Detroit in the building 🏢!!! I can't believe y'all never ate barbecue with all those flavors... 😂
as someone who eats papper cornbread doesnt taste like it , but cornbread is meant to go with stuff so i understand
They gonna cry when they have to go home and eat slamander and eye of newt jollywops or whatever
Harry is an absolute gem.
Ok the Headmaster is literally born to be a Headmaster innit
the fact that this video isn't past 200k likes is diabolical
Gotta do sweet cornbread with some mashed sweet corn in the batter.
These kids just had there first ever foodgasm
Yet this is the food we eat every day in our own home, in America. We get bored with food here which is why we keep coming up with more. 😂
Best video ever haahahaa
These boys ate like Kings bless them Lord! The best is always imo the headmaster i swear he be loving more than the kids
We have a place here in NC called the smoke pit. It has burnt ends, ribs, brisket, turkey, pulled chicken, etc for meats and then bbq baked beans, creamed corn, sweet potatoes, cornbread, deviled egg potato salad, cole slaw, red slaw, etc for sides. It also has like 6 different sauces for each meat. It is SO amazing. They give you awesome portions as well, you definitely get your moneys worth!
I’d love to see a British Rugby team try Texas Barbecue and put the SMACKDOWN on some real SOUTHERN STYLE EATS!
They all layed their heads back , that taste head roll is amazing to see 🥰🙏💗♾️
I agree, cornbread is dry and bland
7:06 lmaooooo
Sublime..my eyes are watering..😛
Put butter on the corn bread and mix it up with some beans and put some brisket in the mix
That mac n cheese looks weak.
This video made me really desperately want BBQ and for that reason I'm sad (just moved, don't know the good places yet.) So instead I'm going to spend my BBQ energy in the form of ranting BBQ-ly into the comments. Please be aware, fellow commenters, that I've never even stepped foot in Texas so this is just more general BBQ knowledge.  I used to be 100% all in on doing the BBQ sandwich, just some pulled pork, brisket, slaw, and sauce on garlic bread (which is different from just ordering a pulled pork sandwich. There's a kind of satisfaction in assembling it yourself.) But recently my absolute favorite thing is just... get my side of baked beans, tear up some meat into it, and mix it in with sauce. Delicious every time.  Something that interests me is the fact that as soon as we started leaving FL, every BBQ place we saw started offering potato salad... and it's become my favorite BBQ side. The thing about coleslaw is that some people do it amazingly, but I absolutely HATE it when it just tastes like vinegar. Gotta be primarily mayo - and potato salad is almost always mayo. It's honestly kind of genius because everywhere I went to before moving, coleslaw was the only light and creamy side, which I feel is really necessary when you've got either rich greasy meat or bread/cornbread. Potato salad lets you have that even if you don't like the slaw.  Cornbread is very hit or miss for me, personally. I definitely understand the reactions to it. At worst it's just sort of sand-like in texture (gritty) and flavor (not much). I love the sweet cornbreads, especially the ones with actual corn bits in em. As far as BBQ breads go, though, IMO a bun of some kind (specifically, not texas toast) or garlic bread will always win. (Though plain texas toast comes 3rd.)  Brisket is the best BBQ meat. Period. No argument. In those "pick 3 meat" options BBQ places almost always seem to have, I usually get sliced brisket, pulled pork, and sausage of some kind if they have it. I've unfortunately never had good BBQ ribs - and they've been pretty much always pork ribs. Too dry everywhere I've tried them, don't fall off the bone nicely. I need to fix this as soon as possible because those beef ribs looked amazing. I'm also surprised at the lack of smoked chicken, which was always a thing where I grew up (though I am thinking I might've stopped seeing it on menus pretty soon after we left the state... but I'm not a huge fan so I didn't really check.)  Sauce wasn't discussed but I feel like I should stake (steak?) my sauce claim anyway. I'm a big fan of sweet + a lil spicy BBQ. Not too vinegary, not mustard-based or white BBQ sauce. Honestly, if I could use BBQ baked bean sauce as a BBQ sauce I absolutely would.  Also surprised at no dessert! Banana pudding with nilla wafers or cobbler was at pretty much every BBQ place I went to growing up (and at Central BBQ in Memphis, who had the most amazing banana pudding I've ever had? I almost wish we'd stopped driving there and just stayed lol.)  ...You know, this didn't actually help the fact that I really want some BBQ. I don't know why I thought it would. Oh well.
You are supposed to eat the chili beans with the corn bread or a little bit of butter in the middle.😂  There is also so much more styles of food in the US beside southern/texas bbq. I bet the burgers would be something cool for the kids to judge.
I really have to visit Texas again. It's been too long. We do not have good BBQ in New Jersey. I can't believe that they weren't raving about the beans. I've been over there and their beans are not even good canned beans.
yo...... we eat this everyday....and still react like this 🤣🤤
Wait, are you saying the age is right?
Corn bread without butter???
It’s not Texas bbq it’s from Chinese and the native people here in the us they thought it to when they came to this continent
I am from Texas and we feel the same way when eating BBQ. It is an amazing experience.
There’s two stories on every one of these videos that seem equally interesting - but you only tell one of them. How do you get this food to England?!
Another thing to do for the corn bread is prep it before you use it for its intended purpose to sop up the BBQ and meat juices you can cut it open and place some butter and honey just saying and sorry they didn't know kids but for next time
It's a shame that some of them didn't like cornbread without knowing it's so much potential to go with southern BBQ and nobody helped you for it and they dint realize either and when the sausage is just so for crisp on the casing after being smoked and cooked for hours oh man
The one that keeps saying “That’s Lovely” sooo adorbs
Did yall put sugar in the corn bread? Cause idk about yall if it's with bbq we put sugar in it.   From Texas
i never feel pride until i see people from other countires try american food and LOVE it
All those nice  clothes  while eating greasy food
Complaining about the bred crumbs made me mad 😂
This works so well because Brit’s food is so bad 😂
Sugar honey iced southern tea 😊
lol love the headmasters reaction to everything 😅 He doesn’t hold back, just dices right in.
And that brisket looks reheated too. Fresh off the pit would blow their mind.
Americans win again! Texas BBQ is my favorite.
The UK eat like they're still at war. They need to get rid of toast and beans and expand their pallets !!!!!!
They’re going to go home and described this to their parents to whom it will sound like Contact when Jodie Foster tries explaining aliens.
They've seperated the groups based on color
Chicago has better ribs and bbq in general .. and I live in N.Texas. Chicago Mexican in the south side take it to a different level imo.
Poor English people .. stuck with the crummiest food in the planet. Everything in the u.k is disgusting.
To watch how the kids minds are absolutely blown is really fun.  They will never be the same in the best way.  I love how enthusiastic the Headmaster Dave is about this food, I would like to see him tour the states along with you guys, and Ollie's Dad should come along as well.
I didn't like cornbread when I was young, either.  Now it is a nice treat every now and then.
Harry is my guy ✊🏾  Homie really loves food
Burnt ends ftw
Damn u boys got a good ass cook it’s not always that juicy and tender over here where bbq is sold u gotta find a good spot
I think Nigel Tufnel would ace the Texas fold. 🥩🍞🥒
The headmaster is vibes ❤
I am so hungry right now!!
No peach cobbler? 🙀
That’s more meat than you could get with a village of rationing tickets
If only they ate the beef sausage with the bread.
2:45 once he steps foot in America he’s looking for the nearest BBQ spot.
1:24 kid on the left. 😂 didn’t waste no time
Best line ever.... I don't think I can eat food here anymore l o l o l o l
I’m going to get emotional 😭
Texans don't call it a texas fold it's called a BBQ sandwich but it's 2 slices of bread not 1
My grams raised from the dead and tried to get through the screen to smack that kid about the cornbread.
Looks so delicious 😋😋 it's making me add Texas to my bucket list. REASON: try authentic TEXAS BBQ!
pickles are the reason why our world hasn't developed that far yet
I raise my glass to "Mr Smith". Every time I've seen these videos I have mad respect.
4:54 no duh he’s been eating bean bread
The kid that said the cornbread was like eating paper I’m gonna say this right here and now I’ve been to the UK and I don’t think I’ve had anything so bland in my entire life other than y’all’s food
I Hatecth8s video. I atecdinner an hour ago. This vid has my mouth watering!😅 We have GOTVto getvthe air traffic controllers rehired so I can fly to Houston for some brisket. That is the modern equivalent of Manna From Heaven!!!
wonder how they tell their parents.
You have tried Texas.  Now try Memphis. And compare the different types of BBQ.
Yeah....importance of cornbread becomes paramount when you go through your first bout of meat sweats.
There’s a reason why we’re so fat over here 😂😂
He poor Brits haven’t had flavor in their food their whole life 😂
"no it's not burnt. no i did not drop it in dirt, grow up"
Somebody f’d up that cornbread..not supposed to be so bland
🔫 Don't ever come to America with That attitude about corn bread.  You don't have to like it, but you do have to respect it.
That rib looks dry tho 😅
2:16 did he really just say what i think he said! LOL
Chewy fat?
To be fair that looked like dry cornbread
7:49 That’s why I eat sweet/honey cornbread, lol. 😂 Also, not all areas in Texas default to sweet tea. I recently went to England and tried breakfast tea, which just tasted like warm iced tea, even with the little bit of sugar and milk, which I was pleasantly surprised, since I prefer unsweetened tea, especially sun tea.
How do they get the food there im guessing they make it there?
They dont look like they are in highschool
They HAMMERED that meat
Who prepares this American food in😮 Britain?
To the kid who said the cornbread is bland and is like eating paper, dawg ur from the uk u guys eat beans on toast and disgusting foods don’t ever talk about the corn bread like that again. U guys literally wish u had our food there
Too many food orgasms!!
British Hairstyles are wild. Rocking the Bed Head 😂
Gotta get them boys some sweet cornbread
This is Gooossshhh!! Love this tutor 😅
Learned there more than beans and toast with tea on the side.
I love the boys reactions
The two younger boys you could just not disappoint they couldn’t get enough 😂
Got to make sweet cornbread
I love these kids, they are so honest and funny.  And the Principal (Head Master) is so fun to watch his sheer enjoyment. ❤
Poor kids
you want it to be more bland.    yep that's what my English grandmother (via Canada, and I'm a born Yank) said about food there... all boiled, all bland.  Her idea of massive flavor was yorkshire pudding :)   ( she was from Bath area, grandad Lancashire... )
This wasn't genuine Southern cornbread. Genuine Southern cornbread needs to be warm from its original bake, slathered in full-fat butter, and sprinkled with a touch of salt, sugar, and pepper. If these kids had tried genuine Southern cornbread, I guarantee they would have loved it.
Kid 1: "I love pickles!" Kid 2: "Oh you've got pickles again!" Flashback to: Younger Kid 1: "Are you putting the pickles in the milkshake?" Younger Kid 2: "Yeah!" Me: "Relatable."
Joy. Pure, authentic, joy. It's lovely to watch. Especially when BBQ is involved. Food really connects us all in the best ways.  Gotta say though... Where was the honey butter for the corn bread. Would have gotten a very different response.
that british high school has never seen so much freedom (and cholesterol) on one plate before
Put some butter on the cornbread for crying out loud.
Give them a taste of MEXICO next!
... These men are also going to learn about what we americans call "The Itis" after this meal. Lol.
You have to stop them from using utensils. BBQ is HANDS ONLY!!
Texan here. I never get tired of BBQ.
The fact they did not drown the BBQ in sauce puts a tear of happiness in this Texan's eye!
We need Mr Smith to join Jolly on the next US Southern trip. It would blow his mind! 😄
I'm from an Atlanta suburb.  I love Bar-b-que but I agree that corn bread isn't that good.
😂 im vegan im from Tx and this is really enticing
They're ALL gonna need a nap after this🤣
If you don’t like mac & cheese, you will be hunted when you come to America
Every slow cooked brisket comes with a glock
"Thats lovely"
Funniest part is that a lot of flavors we associate with barbeque now were actually very popular in the middle ages for some reason. Time's a flat circle.
They said the cornbread wasn't good, they haven't put a little honey on it 😂
"Texas fold" im from Texas and ive never heard it called that. But I do it all the time.
This is proof our food is just better
Love their content - kids are adorable!
Ok. How do they bring all these foods to Britain?
It’s funny to hear a little boy describing BBQ as “lovely”. He’s right of course, but ya just wouldn’t hear that here. 😂 PS - I’m from Texas and have never heard of a Texas fold and I don’t like BBQ beans either! 😊
It’s absolutely sublime
FBS
" this is the best sandwich I've ever had " that's crazy UK need to up their game on food 😭
I liked watching them put the beans on the bread like “beans on toast” 😂 here in southern Texas we use the bread to grab the beans with our hands, or dip the bread in the bean juice.
cornbread really needs butter and honey.
I love their reactions. 😂
Where's the honey on the cornbread
As a born and raised Texan who has consumed a lot of brisket over my life, I gotta give props.   Even our friends up in the northern states don’t do Texas bbq right, so well done for making a legit Texas spread
Gotta put butter on top of cornbread
I can't imagine growing up never having had BBQ. Just amazing to watch their reactions.
BBQ is unlike anything else. its just happiness in food form
They need to slather some butter on the corn bread!
7:46 wow ur one to talk
Next they have to try Kansas City Bar b que Its the barbecue capital of the 🇺🇸United States 😊
Texas bbq is amazing but it's expensive as h3ll
Just me or is the headmaster like weirdly really handsome
@12:54 my guy is on the cusp of breaking into a full on meat sweat fiasco. Love the content
Please what is the restaurant called you got the bbq from?
“British Students Try American Breakfast” 🇺🇸🏈🦅
I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed an episode more! Makes me want to get some Texas bbq right now 😋
That corn bread looks dry. True cornbread is like a moist cake.
that tea is so light😭
Pit beans are bleck.  Everything else is top tier.
I love seeing these young British gentlemen and their headmaster, in their lovely proper suits, absolutely chowing down on good Texas bbq, warms my Southern heart! 😊❤
Why didn’t they tell them to have butter and honey with their cornbread?
I'm from TX and my mouth is watering. I think I'm having brisket tomorrow, it's sooo good.
Not better than heinz beans ?! Lmao
This American also does not like bread crumbs on mac and cheese, never understood it.
The year 7 kids aren’t even British anymore, they’re to American for that country
Cornbread needs a spread!
Cornbread must’ve been trash.
British kids try real food for the first time*
By season 9 they’ll be at Labonne for diabetes 😂
Texas fold ? You mean a samwhich ?
It should be a crime for these poor lads to be deprived of flavor and good food for this long .
The kids putting their beans on their toast SENT ME 🤣🤣🤣
There are many types of cornbread out there.  And most cornbread tastes best while still hot with a pat of real butter slathered on.
The headmaster had some BBQ sauce on his chin. That crackle sound from the bite of the sausage, classic. The one who said "that's lovely" has  earned a good grade for his comment.  Enjoy
You should introduce these kids to TexMex
Now you know why we’re fat 🤣
Please never make cornbread  again 😂😂😂
The small boy with the curly hair and blue stripped tie is my spirit Animal
I have tears in my eyes from laughing and my cheeks actually hurt from smiling. ❤
“You’re the funny one” HILARIOUSS
I always wondered how to you get them to them 😅
Waduh. Izin subscribe
To the kid saying never make cornbread, he’s definitely getting banned from the states 😂😂
There's only two wrong ways to eat ribs.  1. knife and fork  2. with restraint.  Just dive in, get sauce on your cheeks, and C O N S U M E.
quite frankly, I prefer the sweet cornbread, like what you get from Famous Dave's.
It seems eating barbeque with one's bare hands is an instinctive behavior in our species.  too right
0:12 Repeat after me, make sure to pause briefly at each comma: "I pledge alliegence, to the flag, of the United States of America..."  seriously, please come over here, we need more sensible folks voting against dipsh!t donny moscow. I know it takes a while to be naturalized but together we can fix the trajectory of this tailspin. I don't like being ashamed of where I come from.
These boys are really being polite and controlled.  When my sister's three teen boys started in on a platter of food it was like a pride of lions sharing a gazelle.  Their was no politeness and it was a feeding frenzy.  That cornbread looked really dry and it can easily happen.  I add some honey to the batter for flavor and when the cornbread is done baking I use a fork to put some holes in the cornbread and then pour melted butter on top and along the sides where the cornbread has pulled away from the baking dish.  The holes allow the cornbread to drink in the butter.  Once the butter is soaked up, I give it a second treatment.  You end up with a moist, not soggy, cornbread that has a honey butter flavor.  Sometimes, on the next day I will cut a couple squares of cornbread and give it a light toasting.  Then I will pour some maple syrup over it.  Have some bacon and\or sausages with it and you've got a delicious breakfast.
Poor British. Oh.. flavor lol
I'm going to have to go with Mr. Smith's opinion on most of this, mainly because the kids are still at the age where they've yet to finalize their sense of taste. Like they kind of know what they like, but they'll eventually finalize on what they will and won't eat around their mid 20's and then finally finalize their main diet around their late 30's. 20's is when you do all the diets and acts of solidarities and fads. 30's is when your kids have their dietary needs and your health issues start showing up and reality sets in that you can't just have McDonalds every week as that emergency late night dinner, even though they're the only ones open past 9 pm on weekdays...them and other similar fast food places.  But I find it interesting that British kids....namely them being British, of all people have the audacity to say that brisket looks unappetizing uncut, meanwhile the traditional British cuisine has literal blood pudding and spotted dick.........but nah, it's the thing that took a lot of effort into making delicious that looks gross..........I'm saying this out of sarcasm, but no wonder the British empire collapsed.  To answer the question as to why you guys in the UK don't have barbecued brisket over there is mainly because you guys don't smoke your meats. Or rather I should clarify, none of you besides the few American BBQ restaurants over there, dedicate the time to smoke brisket. Your use of brisket is in pot roasts, stews, and in making beef pastrami.  Personal preference and just a tip for the boys, if you're not a fan of the mac 'n cheese, take the pulled pork, mix some BBQ sauce around in it and then mix that saucy pork into the mac 'n cheese. Seems simple, kind of weird. You'll get a slightly different experience that might elevate it for you. I know it's one of my favorites.  Also, I've got to congratulate all these fine gents. They're finding out in person what the definition of the "meat sweats" is. Also thanks Mr. Smith for the meme "WOW!" at 12:36.
Where can I apply to be a teacher at this school 😂😂
They are making me want BBQ !!
American beef is a whole different level, my dad worked in the U.S. for a while and he hasn't been able to replicate the taste.
I’m now wondering what are they eating in the UK
Enjoy! You have to try the Texas Twinkie 🤠
You have to put butter on the cornbread. Or some people do hutter and jam/jelly. Pinto beans and corn bread is also a great combination some add mayonnaise to theirs as well.
Noticed that young kid what age can I LEGALLY  move to the us. Lol
As an American girl who said their favorite food was steak in 2nd grade I would love to see British school girls try Texas bbq for the first time
Food that can unite us all
Should’ve made sweet cornbread it’s even better
Always hilarious to watch people of other nationalities try one of America's greatest exports lol. Though got to say telling us to stop making cornbread is a crime.
OK, so love this series it’s awesome but why are there no girls in it
I wonder if they got that "Itis" after the meal???
This was hilarious...Im a native Texan and we barbecue a lot especially in the Summer and some holidays.
Cornbread and cinnabutter 😋
The kids reactions are funny.  The principal/headmaster is absolutely hysterical.
some of these ages feel like lies, Mack's voive is too deep to be 9
Didn’t even give them the best BBQ from the US
Alternative title: "British Highschoolers Try Food With Seasoning"
You need butter and honey on the cornbread.
Love mr smith loves his foods  the kids are adorable ❤
What type of corn bread did you fed them? The out of the box kind or the real sweet soft kind?
love this video. I must have watched it a dozen times. Please do more like this especially with Monty and Freddie...those 2 make me laugh each time
Mama’s home cooking.
Watching foreigners try American foods is seriously one of my favorite past times on YouTube.
11:27 as a midwesterner them saying it has to much texture made me laugh sooo hard 😂
3:46 never had pickles? What in the hell is going on in the UK?
We here in Texas try to make the corn bread moist but sometimes it definitely can be a tad dry. I suppose it depends on who's making it. Love to see ya'll enjoying our BBQ! :)
firm beliver this is really why the US Colonies rebelled
I am a TEXAN and I loved this!!! Awesome to see they enjoyed the fatty brisket and described it perfectly.   They are hooked 😮 Me too!!!
American food is the BEST!! ❤ Try watching the video where the opposite happens: US teens trying Brirish food! American teenagers are spoiled! Most of them cant stand Brit food, or hate it, refuse to try it, or need water to swallow it! Enough said!!! Plz go watch that video!! Americans have everything from hamburgers, tacos, pizza, hotdogs, mac n cheese, & PB&J's... & more!!❤😊
cornbread needed honey butter
The headmaster I think has my favorite reactions, he's fantastic 😂 him and the blonde bro with the hair that fluffs out sideways. Absolutely delightful
Tbh our mac n cheese is way more cheesy and yellow
Here's a thought, why not "bring" the folks from Memphis BBQ and Black's BBQ to London, plus the TexMex from Austin (San Antonio is actually better IMO) and have them cook for the kids & the HeadMaster at that school you always go to (don't know the name) and have them cook for them and show what they are really missing...  The preparation, the effort, and then finally the meal.  I would love to see that episode...
I love making brisket
A British person calling something bland is hilarious
So are Brits raised from a young age to cover their mouth when chewing regardless of whether their mouth is open or closed? All these video's show people covering their mouths even when chewing? I suppose it's part of a cultural norm, whereas, in the USA, it's mainly reserved for situations where your mouth is full and you are trying to talk AND CHEW at the same time (so as not to show the contents of your mouth to whoever you are talking to). In many instances if there is something said and the chewing isn't really impacting the ability to understand what is being said, there is no need to cover the mouth as it simply causes what is being said from being intelligible .
This video with all your others about Texas BBQ just makes me salivate and wish this type of smoked meat was available in my part of the USA. It can be shipped from TX using dry ice, but would not taste the same I'm sure when warmed up. Did you rely on a local London restaurant to source this food from?
smart kids, takes much intelligence to describe food in such wonderful ways.
i so love watching them try new foods - their expressions are priceless!!
I moved to Texas 3 years ago from California and even I feel proud of them for enjoying the food
Come to Canada NOW😅
Speaking as a Southerner, glad ya'll enjoyed it!  I too am not a big fan of corn bread UNLESS it's sweet cornbread.
Arkansan here. Loved every second of this video, it gave me great pride. The best barbaque in Arkansas is 5 minutes down the road from my house. Also, don't worry, I'm not a fan of cornbread either haha
This is how meat was meant to be eaten.
I'm 😢 h u n g r y 😢 Probably the worst time to watch content like this
Cornbread is boring unless you add bacon drippings to batter, cook in cast iron and add butter while it's still hot. That's the secret.
Those boys are priceless!
Mack and Cheese from a pan has no crunchy on top. Baked Mack and Cheese casserole from the oven does have the crunchy. I don't like the crunchy either.
What? No banana pudding for dessert?
Need that sweet corn bred with some honey butter
I love these keep these coming
Much better export than the fast food chains… quality vs quantity
When I heard someone say, “When the British crossed over to America, they solved all the blame of British cuisine. That is American cuisine,” I couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
I heard after video they dropped their accent, bought a eagle, got a diesel pick up truck and rode it all the way to America
They are not having food for the next 10 months🤣
Texas is amazing
8:00 a little bit of maple syrup on the cornbread and it’s over🤙🏽
3:51 wtf? These kids hv been seriously sheltered
Brits: conquers the world to control the spice trade also brits: don't spice anything
It’s doesn’t matter where you’re from once you try Texas brisket and beef ribs we all have the same reaction 😂
Why they eat the sandwich like that lol
Ollie, I noticed the Mammoth Mountain shirt! Is there a video of you guys there? My favorite place to snowboard!
Trust me if they don’t wanna come here
That mac and cheese looks nasty
One little fella could be a food critic.  His taste buds are on point!
I think each kid went home and asked their parent can they visit America next vacation.
Why does the white students get juice but black get water🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
your the funny one
im jealous from seeing them eat
Meat is sweeter on bone
This just made me so hungry.  And it’s the middle of the night.
Carful, you might give the black kids gout.
I’m here for the head mahstuh 😂
As a native Okie (Oklahoma), which is like the ball cap of Texas, I can say I’ve never been more proud 😂  THIS is BBQ- if you are doing hamburgers, chicken & hotdogs it’s a cook out / grill night.  This is your only warning.  Tell us the function is a BBQ, and I see NO brisket, pork, ribs, sausage or bologna slow cooked for over 12hrs- hands are being thrown.  I don’t make the rules.
HOPE MACARONI H8R boy’s mother doesn’t see this!!!!! I’d be thrilled to have Mac n chz often
Corn bread is supposed to have BUTTER!!!😂
The only thing that's too cheesy is a block of cheese... And Dad jokes😂
The little curly haired kid has the funniest reactions 😂 after every bite it's like he zones out realizing how good the food is because doesn't complain.
I like how they actually try new foods american kids you take for bbq and they eat tenders and macncheese.
The “crusty bits” are not authentic😅 11:32
Harry had a life changing experience
I’m surprised none of them started singing God save the queen. Texas bbq can change your whole mood
Put sugar in your cornbread
Two things we knkw how to do in tbe states and thats cook and eat 😊 Glad these guys enjoyed it.
These boys will never forget this and Texas is definitely on their bucket list now lol
It’s hard to be fit in America with food that is just so good.
These kids are in middle school, not high school. In the U.S., high school is grades 9-12. To convert from British school "years" to American grades, you subtract 1, so these kids are in grade 6 to 8.
Put honey on the corn bread
4:22 been in Texas my whole life & NEVER heard of “the Texas fold”….however, that’s just a natural thing to do with brisket slices😂😅
As a Texan who actually ordered BBQ today, this is making me want to get another plate real quick 😭😭😭😭🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Am I the only one wondering how they get it there without the food going gross
Why are there no girls?
I adore british people but I cried after spending a week there because the food was terrible and I was so sick of not liking it. I actually cried.
Texan here. Did I see kidney and black beans in there? Texas BBQ beans are pretty much always just pinto beans. Also, potato salad is a far more traditional side than mac and cheese, and beef ribs aren't very common. Everything else looks pretty legit though. If only you had buttered and toasted the bread on a griddle.
Watching this I realize how spoiled I am being born and raised in Texas.  I've been smoking brisket, beef ribs,  pork ribs for the past nearly 50 years.  Can't even tell you how many times I've had this.  It is so fun watching the Brits enjoy Texas BBQ!!
why does Mack look like brad pitt in his prime?😭
Can you imagine at any age, finally, FINALLY getting to eat Texas BBQ, then having to eat British food again? Just brutal! Wahi' Valleys
I think i might be the only Hindu who watches these vids
It’s a special treat for a lot of us in the states as well! Especially if you’re not in the south. BBQ in the western states can be quite expensive and not nearly as good as what you find in the South. Colorado is not exactly known for its cuisine. We have some decent BBQ places here, but if you’ve ever had legitimate Texas, Tennessee, Kansas, or the Carolinas, it completely ruins BBQ for you anywhere else. No other state can hold a candle to these guys. We need a legit BBQ place here in Colorado. They would make a KILLING!
Everyone of these kids has now applied for an American Citizenship
That kid is a young Brad Pitt
Sweet cornbread is the best that’s the only cornbread I will eat lmao
Love watching these well bred kids tearing meat from bone and scarfing it!🤣☺️🤤
Should have been sweet cornbread. Try a little sugar in your mix
You can tell they've never had a fold. Their biting it in the middle like a regular sandwich
They also need to try some banna pudding and some homemade cobblers.
They should've had a big ol glass of sweet tea with lemon
Texas girly here! It warms my heart to see these kids enjoy our food. ❤
Yes....yess!! Indoctrinate that kids to only eat our food!!
Never thought I would wanna go US until this video
Texan here cornbread didn’t look good at all. Looked dry like mine freshly made. With actual corn 🌽 bits and jalapeño 👌🏼 💯
Why did we feed the Mackers kid? He should be forced to watch but no tasting. Matter of fact get him a cheeseburger.
Cornbread can be hit or miss. I've had some absolutely amazing cornbread.
I'm from Kansas I love this
Got to eat cornbread with butter and honey not dry LOL
7:47 I'm 100% with you. I can't stand corn bread it's a texture thing it's gritty. I prefer sourdough bread.
Mr Smith deserves his recognition. You can genuinely tell he's done good with those kids and the fact the he's a true natural foodie, he deserves everything coming his way!
ANYTHING is better than beans & toast.
Had you but given us fair taxation and affordable tea, this would be British cuisine. xD
I sense an underrated channel
They need to try jiffy cornbread
I like this new generation of kids. Even tho the old ones are still the best ❤
Well, now I need barbecue for lunch! 😂
The twins, not funny
I'd love to taste brisket in my country, brisket will be worth millions
Harry got the sweetness voice..
This makes me so happy
Please go to a pow wow and eat fry bread. It changed my life lol
Wearing suits while eating BBQ is a bold move.
No slaw in a Texas BBQ sandwich. Bun, sliced or chipped brisket, sauce, pickle and/or sliced white onion. Nothing else or it is not traditional. Been eating this sandwich for all 58 years of my life. I'm 6th generation Angelina County, Texas.
Texas BBQ is not southern BBQ! Texan!
Thanks for what you do y'all!🎉 Great vids!
This was a fun watch SATX here, where was the bbq from?
that one kid is so real for saying stop making cornbread
All that looks dry
They're picking up coleslaw  with their hands! Give the dudes some serving spoons or something 🥴
Try hot cornbread in cold milk with salt!
Nearly 5 million subscribers to watch British people experience flavor. Peak humanity.
As an American Texan to be exact, you did not at all d the corn bread right!, it has to be hot like how mom or our older sisters make it right out the oven, and you have to put salted butter on it or cut it in half and put the butter in between!
i love to see the british fed 🥹
😂 bro was in heaven, the more older guy
FYI for all the Brits, you can also braise brisket really well if you don't have a smoker.
I get inexplicable joy out of watching Brits try American food ❤❤❤❤
Have them try Mexican food next!!
Is it wrong that I'll from Texas and I've never had any of this food?😅
Give them a sloppy joe
British people try food for the first time
Now you know why we Americans are so fat! LOL!
As a Southern American, this makes me feel so good to see British people enjoying our BBQ!
lol I love that when they showed the mean “Zadok the Priest” was playing in the background
The cornbread and Mac and cheese were bad
“If you could get this here, how often would you-“ Everyday. Everyday.  Us too fam, us too. Idk how vegetarians and vegans do it.
When Brit’s taste taste for the first time
This right here makes me happy to be a born and raised Texan … smoking meat low and slow
You have to slather butter on the cornbread, that’s the southern way👍
Jolly good stuff.  Brilliant
As a native Texan, I love this
I'm  deprived.  I live in Idaho and might as well live in England!
I always had the cornbread warmed up and then put butter and honey on it after dinner it’s delicious
That’s like cavemen discovering fire
Nap time bout to go crazy
Texas in the house!
When your white co workers have some of your ethnic lunch
Send those boys and their teacher to Texas for the real thing! Then have them hauled away in chains to an ICE detention center for having rude memes about Trump and Vance on their cell phones.
I agree with the boy about the cornbread!
5:06 you guys should definitely do a video about portuguese food. Those kids would lose their minds over how good our food is. 🤤
I feel sorry for their indoor plumbing tomorrow...LOL
The kids: Hi. Him: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHABABAHAHA
He said he felt like I he was being hugged 😂😂😂
Next time crumble the cornbread upin a cup or glass then add a spoon or two of sugar then pour milk over it.  Let it sit a bit then eat like cereal.
like eating a crouton - these kids and headmaster are simply fabulous.  Just love watching these shows and utterly marvelous
This video is food for the soul. To see these young people enjoy BBQ is heart lifting.
Yeah, cornbread needs to be eaten with something, I prefer honey or butter, but there’s gotta be something else.
At least they now know why all of us are so FAT here in America.
Controversial opinion… Johnny Cake better than cornbread. Those kids are correct, cornbread is not good.
good BBQ and good farmer's breakfasts are the absolute cornerstones of American cuisine.
I’m getting so hungry
Right sup your cornbread and make sure it's sweet or jalapeno
How did you two choose this school?
Loved it when Headmaster groaned and his eyes rolled back in his head.  Coolest Headmaster ever.
omg they are so stinkin cute! "that's lovely" so fun watching them enjoy something new and delicious!
The craziest thing is the bbq was made by someone in Britain. They haven’t tasted something made by a real Texan.
The cornbread is delicious with salted sweet butter on top, but its also dry on purpose so its a palate cleanser between pieces of meat on the plate! 😄
Have them try beans and cornbread. It is the best combination!
The Headmaster is an American, he just doesn't know it
Cornbread depends on the region. Someplaces in the US cornbread is bland as plain grits (for us grits are not a food group) but in the better places cornbread is flavored to be a sweet bread with spices and maybe a sweet butter (like honey butter, sugar butter, or brown sugar, or sweetener and pecan pieces, cinnamon, etc. species/sweeteners). US cornbread can be bland, but can also be flavorful and/or sweet enough to be a dessert on its own!😊
I’m so hungry now
I cant get over everyone of them putting the beans on bread 😮
I'm from Connecticut. I've been to England and Texas... and right now I've feeling very proud of Texas. Lol
Watching those guys eating real food warms my heart. Bbq is absolutely an american staple and is always some of the best food I have ever had. Caujun and bbq are seriously some of the best food on the planet.
They tasted flavor for the first time  ❤️‍🩹🌹🔋
oohh I got Mouth-watering here
That teacher needs to marry an American woman, he could eat li,e this every night!
I live brisket so much. Ribs and brisket are like my favourite thing in the world
I don't think that cornbread was right. It looked really dry. Yall should have put some sour cream in it.
We learned this recently 💀
They’re gonna be chasing that feeling for the rest of their lives
They need to try Cajun seafood.
0:44 that's what she said
Now I gotta get some BBQ
Son, weve won every round since 1776. Glad you enjoyed the BBQ. 😉
“i don’t think i can eat here(in England) anymore lol hahahaha
Jolly 👋   I’m not a corn bread person either …  He doesn’t think he can eat food there anymore 😅😂🤣  Shalom✌️and Agape 💕
Another southerner here. Nothing like cultures bonding over meat cooked with love.
Never heard and American call that a Texas fold 😭
Glad y’all enjoyed it! Howdy from Texas!
gotta feel good for these kids to finally have good food. British food is truly horrid.
The British are turning the British into Americans with this one 😂😂😂
I don't eat the fat, it's too goopy. I usually slough it off. You kind of forget how good this is when you have eaten it every Sunday for nearly 2 decades.
Get some good rice boudin 🤤🤤
I love it how they all just automatically put the beans on the bread!
how in the fudge was i not already subscribed i watched the other group of boys grow up on this channel wth man i luv this channel i show all my kids and god kids all the time
As a Texan I've NEVER heard of a Texas fold 😂 it's just a brisket sandwich
Texas BBQ is really the king of foods you just cant beat it
brits hate to admit americans have better food lol
Guess you had to have some way to one-up this one, so you saved the best, Kansas City Barbecue, for last! :)
Even though I’m not southern I feel pure joy that these high schoolers are deeply enjoying this side of America. It’s really amazing to see
I just realized that Monty & Freddie (the blonde boys) are twins. Are they related to Henry (the alum who was a Head Boy)?
I love Mac n’ Cheese but I can still relate to the kid that doesn’t, but also don’t have the heart to tell his mum. Mine used to make me suger sandwiches for breakfast when we were late and I hate them. Took me about a year to tell her 😂
Leave it to the Brit’s to call BBQ “lovely” and “sublime” 😂
They're gonna go through taste withdrawals now lol
That coleslaw better have stringed apple slices in there
Should have thrown in some famous Milo's sweet tea in their with that barbecue.
my dad liked his tea in ONE way only ; 4 cups of sugar mixed in to 1 gallon of tea. to this day i have yet to find another person drink that much sugar in tea
Since they were so disappointed with the cornbread, I can definitely make a better version of it.    💯
This made me really hungry!!
I always put butter on my corn bread 😋
Southern BBQ is fusion cuisine and occupies that awesome intersection of salt, sweet, heat, fat and acid — the foundation of any great cuisine!
No one, I mean nobody, ever, eats barbecue in a sport coat and tie.  What have you done!
It’s refreshing to see BBQ from the eyes of the Brits! We are so lucky as Americans to be able to have the food we do! GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY
USA USA USA!!!!
why the graduation song in the background? lollll
So much nicer to watch these kids than our spoiled American kids
Me…. laughing and smiling at my phone the whole time watching this lol 😅
Nice!!
Bro, you set the corn bread up for failure. You had no butter with it. You killed the corn bread
You boys are awesome thanks for all the laughs and i hope these guys feed you foods from other places!
The young lads with the blonde hair have had a massive change in their voice ( milkshake flashback with pickles) lol. They sound totally different now
The teacher didn’t say any words when he eat the sausage just noises
Southern people will never stop making cornbread. There's nothing you can do about it.
Houston they have lost their etiquette!!!
As a Texan born and raised I went England and tried the food. I’m so very you were not born and bred in Texas.
As a southerner, I have to say cornbread is best in muffin form. Out of a skillet or cake pan is too sweet if you ask me.
They need to try my cornbread. They would love it.
Ya gotta eat the cornbread with the beans 😂
That’s not just southern BBQ. We eat all of that up north too!
They should eat Midwestern food
We serve hush puppies in North Carolina. NOT BREAD!!
The kid slamming the cornbread at the end 😂
Britains: “why are Americans so fat?” *tries American bbq* “oh I see now” 😳
Texan here, I have to wonder who made the cornbread and how 😅 it did look a bit dry/bland, you gotta dress it up with butter/bacon grease. I also would’ve loved to see them try southern green beans, the flattish ones with bacon and bacon drippings.  I want to go there and try their food!!!
I'm Asian, the food here is DELICIOUS. But I really want to try authentic American food I bet It'll feel orgasmic
졸리님 제발 한국어 자막이 필요합니다,,ㅠㅠㅠ 재밌는거 같이 봐요 😢
They gave them bad cornbread
I'm with that kid about corn bread. I've NEVER liked it. And I had to laugh when they brought out the sweet tea. I had a good friend in high school who was from London, and I knew there would be some, "that's not tea" quotes haha. Great vid.
The principle is hilarious! 😂
Oh my diddy 2:16
If you want the real Texas experience for cornbread, you have to get HEB (a store) brand of sweet corn bread, or you have to look up a highly rated cornbread with cheese and jalapenos. But yeah, get the WEB sweet corn bread. And don't make it too dry. Shouldn't be like a moist cake, but definitely should not be dry.
As a Texan watching this, made me happy
Holy crap, the kid with the sprained wrist looks just like I did at that age. I'm  American, I wonder if he's Irish and we are distant relatives. I'm rooting for ya bro
Im texan, this made me proud.
There's several ways to make cornbread. Cornbread needs a bit of sugar and then butter and honey on it. Eat it warm. Mac and cheese can get sticky.
it should be the law to play Zadok the Priest whenever you present brisket to someone lmao
Those kids are going to have one huge calorie coma, sure hope their school day is about over.
I can’t believe the amount they put in their mouths!!  Does a lot of chocking happen there?
the key to a great cornbread is to put honey in the batter.  Then it's like sweet cake...so good.
The music
This is making me so hungry!!! Also, I'm from America and have never had brisket...time to book some travels!
I'm a Texan, and I have loved seeing our food through the eyes of the students and the headmaster.
I love how the headmaster is just having the best day of his life with every mouthful.
I need some north carolina bbq now
*Russian airport workers
gotta put some butter on your cornbread....
Based take on the corn bread, corn bread sucks
Suggestions for you: - Bacon meatloaf - Grilled peanut butter and fire roasted strawberry jam sandwich - Hamburger with shredded BBQ pork, fried pickles and smoked gouda
4:20 everything is better with bread and that why I’m an overweight American 😂😂
british people are always saying that america has no traditional food yet here we are
Watching this from Dallas… glad that y’all love the Texas barbecue.
Ok, I’ve lived in Texas my entire life and eaten at some of the best BBQ restaurants in the state for many years and have had some of the best backyard brisket and ribs some folks will never know and I have never ever heard of a “Texas Fold”. It sounds a bit douchey.
This is why we Americans are so fat!
As an American, I really do wanna go visit over there, but I’m scared I’ll starve to death lol
Houstonian. Some of our best BBQ is sold by guys lugging huge pits on the back of pickups. Try Grubbs on side of Haverstock.
Imagine if they tried real seasoned food
They picked the perfect kids for this; their comments were delightful.
This video gave Americans across the nation the biggest egos ever
That one kid ruined food for himself forever 😭😭
My dad sometimes makes steake. And i always eat the garlic that is in the pan😅
Looks like Rudy's BBQ
3:46 DANG! THEY LOOK WAY OLDER
Im frin Ohio. Just visit my honetown. Texas bbq is the best!
I love seeing these videos. Will you guys ever do a videos with girls? I would like to see the girls perspective.
Tbh, yeah, cornbread isnt my type of thing but as some sugar like my mom does and oh boy, is it good
"Pickles" "😲😲!"
I wish I could have tasted some of that food. Lucky kids.
As an American, I don’t like cornbread either lol
The mop- cornbread kid has a future as a food critic!
Yes
my mouth is watering. the brisket looks delicious .
They dnt know that cucumbers are pickles!?
American here! Glad you enjoyed it! Food is like the one good thing we have in this dystopia.
At this point these students are living life at its peak🤣
How the heck did you guys get Dexters Barbecue over to the UK.  Fly it over personally? 😂
Well, now they know why we are all fat here 🤷‍♂️
Adorable, they don't know that that platter of bbq costs close to $150 or more in California
YEEHAW
Yankee cornbread is much better. Moist & sweet and ALL cornbread need butter man come on now !
Texas baby 💪
U need to put butter and a bit of  honey on the cornbread 😂 U don't really eat it plain
I agree with them on the cornbread, ok but not preferred.  Actually, I like the hoecake version of cornbread.
They should try corn bread with some butter on it.
I absolutely love to see other cultures try American FAT ASS foods 😂😂😂😂 AMERICANS WILL UNALIVE EARLY and you guys will not... STAY HOME BROS... 😜
as an american, i had the same reaction the first time i tried brisket
im from the US but ive never been down south and this video makes me wanna buy a plane ticket
at 2:42 he almost left his body 😭😂
It's so hilarious watching them eat this omg, british children yearn for Texan Barbeque
Texas, baby! ⭐️❤️
10:58 Momz got BURND 😂 Punishment 4 life lmao
Y iz it like this? 😂🤣🤣😭😭😭
Are schools segregated in Britain? Nice to see people love Texas BBQ, but sad it's so obvious white and black are separated...and yes, I'm a proud bleeding heart liberal
Alwayz herd British food sucks ssa. Good 4 them. Good 2 c American chemicals influencin nuu generations werldwyde 💀
What age can you legally move to America is crazy
Except here in America is smothered in sauce 😂
Seriously? They fd up corn bread? How tf do you mess up corn bread? "Taste like a crouton"? Means you really fd up the corn bread!!
I’m so glad they love our BBQ as much as we Texans do! 😊
That teacher loves his job today.
You made up the Texas fold. That’s not a Texas thing.
Cornbread did look way too dry.
What's so great about America right now? This! Those british kiddos are having an out of body experience with our BBQ! I love it!
Thank You Guys, your shows are always entertaining!  I love seeing young people triening new things.  I am an American living in Ecuador,  The country is Beautiful as are the people but they have no culinary adventorism.  They prefer to eat the same food their Great, great, great great ansesters ate.  I personely like to try new things, so it is a good thing I can cook!  But watching your show makes me hungry to go back to the states and go to restuarants, just cant afford it.  Thanks Again!
"Why are American's so fat?" ::eats American food:: "Oh, I get it now"
I dont know about everyone else but the two boys with blond hair who likes pickles reminded me of harvey and ray...but blond. Best bud frr
Harry is so adorable and just loving life.
How do they get all of that good over there for them to try? Not just this food but all the fast foods they try.
Now I really want to eat some Texas bbq now (I have never went to america before nor eat any food from it)
That teacher or principal goes to work hoping they show up 😂
Texas bbq has to be one of the best type of food I’ve had.  I’m glad they loved it what’s not to love about it!
Very adorable :)
I can't describe how nice it is to have people complimenting something from America for once.
9:50 his face 😂😂
alternate title: British people taste flavor for the first time
Seeing them enjoy it makes me feel happy, and I don't really know why... It's not like I cooked any of it! 😂   I think it's the look on their faces;   I'm glad they're enjoying it so much!  ❤😂
Born and Raised Texan here. There’s absolutely nothing like Texas bbq
those pork ribs look like theyre from the UK 🤣🤣
8:28 lil bros face when he hit food coma level
What did you say about the cornbread 👿😡😤😠
Jesus Vadim couldn't wait another millisecond lil bro was tweaking from the jump
This is a average Sunday in the south
Curly headed kid is an honorary American
There are different types of cornbread.  I prefer the slightly sweet & cakey.
And now the meat sweats
Any of you "lads" are welcome here in Texas. Love our British friends across the pond. I need to try some of them pork n beans
Only thing I like about cornbread is that it is buttery
This was one of your best videos yet. Advice for the one student who didn't like the cornbread.... Spread a pad of butter then put some honey on it. Also when you were in the States did you have chili? The reason I ask is that you take two pieces of cornbread, slice them in half, put them in a bowl and then pour the chili over the cornbread. A hearty winter dinner...
I love, LOVE how much they enjoy Texas BBQ. It is so sweet to see the adorable kids embrace such delicious food for which Texas is known. I'm not even from Texas (native New Yorker). The Head Master is hilarious, just like Josh & Ollie. So great. 😉 Thanks for the always great content!
Once you have this (meat), this (cornbread) is like eating a crouton🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As an American that has gone to Ireland, France and Italy....they Stink at food....yes, it is very real...no preservatives...but NO garlic...NO spices....NO...not even in Italy.....terribly Bland!
That Principal is going to need a nap after all that food. Makes me hungry watching.
Barb - b - q brings everyone together!
"Are you lying?"....."Your're not lying."
No lie, I'm a black guy who lives in the US with southern roots and I've never been a fan of cornbread either. I mean, if someone makes me a plate and put it on it I'll eat it but I'm not putting it on my plate on my own🤷🏾‍♂️
This was the cutest ever ❤ Love seeing their perspective on American food.
Beef…is…NOT…BBQ!!!!! Get these guys some ENC BBQ .
How many REAL BRIT kids were in this? Not how I remember things. Sure wouldn't say this has anything to do with Brit school kids
Next time drizzle honey on the cornbread
I'm Texan and I'd be quite upset if I got that Mac n Cheese. It should be smothered in cheese, and just dripping with gooey deliciousness from every bite. Also, good cornbread is pan-made so it should be square with a soft breading, and be cut to slide butter in the middle of when you get a square Everything else was great
12:58 yeah we win all rounds welcome back to the 1765-83
Europeans can barley drive 2hours let alone 30 minutes to visit family no way they’re waiting 16 hours for food
This made me miss Texas🥲.
Funny watching  these proper English boys enjoying  a true American dish.
Texas calls it a texas fold. In Georgia we call it a Halfie. Try some east coast BBQ sometime. Same Same but Diffrent. especially with carolina BBQ sauce
Butter on your cornbread, please.
I can't watch this, I'm so jealous. My mouth is watering. I want a Texas fold
Hands down our favorite show… ty
american food is peak
Do they not have food in the uk
A lifetime of eating brickle brackld cheese tuna chips, and BBQ heals them
Btw real barbecue has to be cooked in an old pit. The best bbq restaurants in Texas use pits over a 100 years old.
oh my gahd @jolly you're corrupting a new set of highschoolers 😂 & i think mr. smith lost a bit of a weight.. still looking good though & same as you too.. hope this will be a success like the previous ones.. congrats 🎉🎉
I've lived in the South my whole life, but I still react the same way to a good bbq
“I don’t even think I could eat food here anymore” HAD ME DYING 😂😂
Need to do Louisiana food
Life-long, born-and-bred Texan here; I was grinning and giggling consistently through the video. Well done. 👌🏻👏🏻
Cornbread needs a big slab of butter on it.
Hey hey bloody english, don't hate on our cornbread!!! lol.
Watching these kids and the headmaster all enjoying their brisket just says it all right there. It's like a shared religious experience by all of them. Wait till they try some pork spare ribs. That will knock some clear out of their seats.
british people discover food that isn’t slop
you gotta put butter and sugar of the corn bread!!!
I’m a native Texan and I’ve never heard of the Texas fold… but the bbq is definitely GOLD!!!
Brits: how are Americans so fat?  *tries texas BBQ*  Brits: oh.
Some of those students can be a food critic someday.
I'm a huge fan of the Principal or head master or whatever he's called over there LOL. He's hilarious, and I just love his enthusiasm for foods. 🙂
The thing about cornbread is that it can vary. Like here in New Mexico, I've often seen it dry and crumbling but this college program I was part of had a cook that was from Georgia and her cornbread was much more soft, moist and had a slight sweet flavor because of honey and that's the best cornbread that I've ever tasted. It's just like the meat, I think it varies by state or region because Texas would definitely like to say they're best but I'm sure there's other states in the Midwest who would say the same.   Ribs are good but man I love a pulled pork sandwich with a spicy BBQ sauce. One thing I'll also add about the video is that their southern tea looked.... off? It was more orange instead of the traditional golden brown I've often seen it? Maybe too diluted from the water or too much sugar? I'm assuming these guys buy the food in the United States and have to transport it back to the UK?
Our go to sponsor: the VPN that'll get hacked and not say anything for over a year 😂
Mack is a fine shyt holy cow 🙏🙏😍
Bruhh these are high schoolers💀 thought they were elementary students
Rare footage of British kids experiencing flavour for the first time
You can't convince that Harry didn't go home and tell his parents he's leaving for America lmao
What i love about this series is that kids tend to be brutally honest. The joy they have with certain bites is awesome.
We make the best food by far out of any country in the world
Everything is better with bread in it innit!
To be fair, cornbread is not all created equal. And, having eaten a bit of cornbread in my life, something about that particular cornbread looked a bit possibly dry and dense and perhaps plain. Also it needed to be sliced a bit in the middle & some butter inserted and allowed to melt from the heat.
These kids look like they’re in middle school. Still not surprised that they find out food amazing 😂😂
Glad to see so other Headmaster David Smith fans in the comments 👀 👀 👀
10:13 If you’ve been to steakhouses before, you’ll know exactly what biting into a good sausage is like, with the snap and the soft, juicy sausage. THIS KID GETS IT!
I dont think theres anyone in the world who doesnt like seeing people enjoy their culture ❤❤❤ glad the boys enjoyed!!! And I love seeing Headmaster Smith’s reactions :D
"they make sausage?!" 😂😂😂
Watching their lives change once trying BBQ for the first time is strangely entertaining lol
was the cornbread dry
13:44 I’m Texan and I still don’t get the point of Corn bread 🤢
Their videos are always so wholesome
"We call a Texas fold"; no Texans call it that.
If the cornbread was bland, then it's not made right. Cornbread can be amazing!!!
This exactly how I felt eating at Gates BBQ in Kansas City,Mo.  The one off Brooklyn
Lol tell them how that plate of food costs
Cornbread is best served warm with melted butter or honey drizzled on it
As an American, I want to experience Texas bbq someday. It looks absolutely mouthwatering. I've had some decent brisket but none looked so good as this! 🤤
Watching Brits taste flavors for the first time is my new hobby.
why do Brits have buck ass teeth like that 😂
I find it hilarious that so many of them immediately put the beans on bread.  🤣🤣 Not how Americans eat beans. They should have served butter to put on that cornbread.
Never heard of a texas fold. Looks like an open face to me
2:07 Can we just appreciate how that whole chunk of meat just disappeared, and he looked at his hands, amazed that it vanished so fast lmao
You poor sheltered abused british children
How did yall get bbq over there?
Smone send me a brisket
I love Josh and oli
"My eyes are watering" those are tears of joy my boy
Them boys gonna have the meat sweats😂😂. Hello from Houston, TX!!!
All the way from Texas….your welcome
Shlda gave them some honey and butter with that cornbread.
They got the 2 blks together   *a third has appeared
That cornbread look dry…
Not one “like” or “literally”. Actual grammar!!! So refreshing!!
... and now you know why we're all so fat.
😂😂😂😂 the cornbread needs butter & honey
My fave video! Did they tell the boys about meat sweats though?
The music 😅😅😅😅
“Have you not eaten in a week” 😂😂😂 I really want to try British food badly, it can’t possibly be that bland. Could it🤔😅
POV That one homie: 10:17
Mostly stoked about dude’s Mammoth shirt. Such gnar 🤘
Mr. Smith cracks me up. These kids are wonderful, great video.
Why are they eating the brisket with their utensils
Best food in the south
I can’t wait I really want them to try soul food
2:43 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You need to put some butter and honey on the cornbread!
If a country likes beans on toast, Texas BBQ is gonna change their political and religious beliefs..
At the least you need fresh Butter on the Cornbread. I hope they survived the Meat Sweats lol
Give it a few years and they’ll start to look like American too
Like a victorian era child eating a dorito
They don’t BBQ meat in the UK or what?
I’m quite a snob about cornbread. It HAS TO BE SAVORY … usually just a box of jiffy cornbread PLUS a can of creamed corn mixed in. Otherwise? NOPE!!! It’s too bland & dry otherwise.
The kids change but that lucky teacher gets to be here every year
Liking so many things and then speaking on the ONE thing you didn’t like is peak human race behavior 😂
The identical twin brothers are brilliant, so expressive and entertaining.
As a southerner, how dare you insult cornbread! It goes perfectly with any soup, stew or chili.
Kid said it’s sublime 😂😂😂😂
Plain cornbread though? No butter? No honey or jelly? No jalapeno cornbread?
The kid who said wow haha that was straight from the soul
Texas fold , we call a finder bender. In our area in Oklahoma.
Stop laughing!!!!!
I wish I could try bbq for the first time again
They didn't put any creamed corn in the cornbread. It looks a little dry. Sigh
I lived in texas for 3 years how have i never heared of a texas fold
“Is he lying?” 🤔 ‘eats it’ “he’s not lying
AS A TEXAN! I CAN SAY- PROUDLY   BBQ IS GOATED!!! YEEEEEHAW! ❤
Canes next please
That thumbnail is funny. Kid loves that rib.
The fucking beans on toast makes me wanna cry
We didn't challenge King George just for the guns, he had no clue how to cook meat!
MURIKKKA. Obesity and early death recipe materialized. Notice none of the the British kids are obese or looking like Big Show before their age turns double digits, whereas in MURIKKKA it's obesity galore.
I wonder if DoorDash would deliver Texas BBQ to South Carolina?
Finally the British are being educated about good food
He should’ve got ‘em Texas toast instead of cornbread
Dr. Hoggly Woggly's on Sepulveda in The San Fernando Valley.   Brisket and beef ribs... And beans..
Being from Dallas Texas, I appreciate this video
Meat sweats immediately after this😂
Now yall know why there's so many fat Americans 😂
This is what we eat
Wishing their ancestors got on the ships now 😂
9 years???
Remind those limeys what real food is
10:36  Oh no hes sentient and knows he’s stuck in the uk.
12:25 the kid on the right side (black one) didnt even bite the damn beans your not getting away with this buster
They were dressed so well. Should have given them bibs so they wouldn’t have to worry about their clothes.
i was waiting for one of them to say: All it's missing is beans
Bro just got kicked out of the entire south for the cornbread comment bros gotta got to Nashville for his BBQ now and that might not even do it he might need to start looking for a good BBQ place in the midwest 😂😂😂
Give them Louisiana foods: Gumbo, crawfish, boudin, jambalaya, stuff like that
If “I’m about to buss” was a video
not going to lie britishs aren't exactly culinary giants ither, mostly not for meats
This much be from a private school. Community school kids aren't witty like this.
“Everything is better with bread in it.” How true.
What adorable children.
That’s why people from the US are overweight.  There’s so much good food of different countries
Cornbread is best with butter.  Was the 15% off discount the gift for the headmaster? That’s so cringe guys, yall should’ve got him a real gift.
Fold as in f-o-l-d?  Is there another one? lol
Then they go home to some white bread with canned beans on it😅❤
This is the most unanimous verdict episode. Every single one of them at some point said this was the best thing they have ever eaten.
I loved watching this! It makes me so happy! Though I was sad I saw no honey butter for the cornbread!😂
Better warn them about meat shakes.
I’m from Texas and every BBQ meal I have is still pretty life changing lol
I’m from Texas and I have never heard of a Texas fold and now I’ll forever be calling it a Texas fold! 😂
God damn I’m hungry
Every time they do these videos it just proves that British people are no better than Americans if they had our options
Texan here. Can’t just raw dog cornbread. Put some butter on it and they will change their tune.
To be honest they don't even closely look like high-schoolers, they look like grade 5 max
As a Texan this makes my heart happy ❤❤❤
I want a plate 😊
watching this made me want to live in texas, but then i realised im gay
Cornbread is delicious you are wrong my friend
Why did you give them dry cornbread? It's supposed to be slathered in butter.
I would love to see them try Mexican food.
I like how they all mixed reactions on the cornbread 😂
It’s be cool if the kids got to come to American and truly get to experience America 🫶🏼
😂 they might need soul food baked macaroni and cheese
You must introduce them British students to Tex-Mex food next…..!!!!
You must introduce them British students to Tex-Mex food next…..!!!!
You must introduce them British students to Tex-Mex food next…..!!!!
Please come to Brasil 🇧🇷
I love them! They are adorable
Love theses kids
Cornbread needs butter. I don't understand, everyone where I am from(born and raised in NC)would tell you this.
Should have had the cornbread drenched in milk
The year 7 lads look like babies 😢❤ please do many more such vids!
That kid is about ready to denounce his citizenship and move to America 😂
You did them wrong with crusty mac n cheese man, good mac n cheese should be gooey through and through
The only thing missing is the nap afterwards
As an American who has traveled and moved a lot, I admit Texas cornbread is the worst. Thankfully each state has their own version ranging from tamale-like jalapeno and chili to airy sweet and honey to almost fluffy cake. My favorite? Hushpuppy jalapeno cornbread sticks fried up and served with catfish.
I’ve never seen brisket being expressed this way 😂😂😂 “SUBLIME”
White cornbread!! Not yellow
Guys, I know you have an aesthetic to fit but c’mon, you couldn’t put those boys in proper rib eating attire? 😂😂
High schooler and nine years old ?
They didn't make the cornbread correctly. Texans wouldn't have eaten that either unless they gussed it up with melted butter and honey to make it more appealing.
He’s not eaten in a day? That was a concerning statement.
@jolly the one kid who put the pickles in his drink..take him to Kannapolis or Concord NC. There's a place called What-A-Burger (not Texas version) that has a drink called The Witch Doctor!
cornbread is more for mixing with beans not really eating on it's own it's to dry with no flavor unless you make sweet cornbread. Cook you up some dry beans for about 4 hours season it then get you a bowl and put a cube or two of cornbread in it with a bit of butter and mix it up.
That cornbread must’ve sucked
Looking at this video is hell for me im hungry and the BBQ looks scrumptious!🤤
As a Texan, can confirm. It's bliss down here.
Bet they’re upset we kicked em out🇺🇸
As a Texan, bbq is my favorite food on earth but I'm always leary when it comes to these food reaction videos on YouTube because I feel people will always say the food is incredible regardless of whether they liked it or not, just for the clicks or not wanting to be rude to the people making the video, etc...  As I said, I'm from TX and TX BBQ is my favorite food on earth so I am extremely biased.  But out of all the food reaction videos on YouTube, TX BBQ always feel the most genuine when it comes to how much they liked.  That's why I wanted to ask people in these comments sections whether they get the same vibe or am I just too biased to notice that the people eating are treating the txbbq with the same kid gloves they do with all the other food as well.
Aaaaaaand now I have to order in brisket for lunch 😂
This is the ultimate triumph of the American Revolution.
Their reactions were pure joy! Brings smiles and good vibes to a Monday!
They messed up by using kosher pickles vs Dill pickles. Ruined the experience IMO
THESE ARE NOT HIGHSCHOOLERS😖
“I’ve had bread.” 😂
Merica
Man sounds like y’all fucked up your cornbread cause ain’t no way they’d be calling mine bland
This is so cool to see! I’m a Michigander by birth, but I live in Texas and definitely love my Texas barbecue!  Come to Austin next time you’re in Texas… It’s food truck Central
Cheers from Texas!  I am happy to see you’re enjoying our grub!  👍🍻
How do you mess up cornbread 😂😂😂😂
They should have an American kid eat with them and watch their reactions.
The seventh years are the one I like lol. They going crazy
Yall ruined them Brit kids. Why do i say that? You violated the royal law of spices and good food .
its bangin'!!!
Are you lyin? ... He's not lyin.
They forgot to supply the sauce...🙄
corn bread needs butter and honey
In Florida the bread would be garlic bread
I assume they slept incredibly well after this.
As a southerner I want to bring more of this to England
After all my days on the internet, watching British kids come to the full revelation that they’d be fatties if they lived in the US is one of the greatest types of content I’ve ever seen.
Every single one of them immediately putting the beans on the bread is the funniest thing I've ever seen
I like the Kinks. The food is disgusting.
First time I have heard brisket described as “quite lovely”
Introducing highschool kids too flavor besides beans on toast
I’m going to force my dad to make one of these dishes
Corn bread - maybe add honey butter
As a Texan, I agree about the cornbread. It's too dry for me.
The beans don’t go on the bread 😭
7:07 😂 the kid on the left’s facial expressions!!
Why are there never any female students in these videos?
My favorite episode!
Can't believe the majority reaction to the cornbread. We know how to make things taste good in America. Will it give us cancer and make us obese...probably...but it tastes damn good!!
There is no way they didn’t like the corn bread.
I love not only watching these reactions, but the comments. We all want to be loved and seen and appreciated, and no better way to connect that FOOD! Love it. ❤
The itis nap after is the best
You should gave them boys sweet corn bread 😂
Actual food tastes great, doesn't it lads? This is proof that you DON'T have to continue to eat like the Germans are bombing you.
As a Texan I’m glad they love it ❤ funny thing is I’m not a fan of cornbread but my husband is lol
I’m wondering if their corn bread was a bad representation, the best corn bread is always moist and sweet.
don't watch this when you're hungry! ... just sayin
Who knew that we could have ended that stupid bloody war with a BBQ plate?
@ 2:29 the culture began to chane him
Rename the title to "british kids try flavor for the first time"
There gut probably just died latter lol
I dont get how they have the food prepared fresh for the guests. Do they fly it over and re heat it?
Cornbread, melted butter...pinto beans..smathered over it....with ketchup and jalapenos....game over. The kiss of god....all for a buck....
What steak are you eating that the fat is chewy? 😂
Good luck getting them to eat microwaved pork n beans on bread again lol
The teacher is the one that loves everything. But these videos are a treat to watch.
Can someone pls give me freddies number plssssssss or his be real or sum like hes actually kinda my type
You never fail to make me hungry 😂😂😂
Texas BBQ connoisseur here - This is how the spark gets spread. Many years ago, a moment like these kids are having at a Texas Monthly Top 50 restaurant flipped a switch in my soul forever. I bought a smoker and was hooked ever since. One of these young men could be the catalyst to bring proper, respectable BBQ across the pond. I love this!
I should not watch this while hungry. This is just torture.
Evil  skinheads coming to America to ruin our country
Are the two blonde guys eating together twins?! I can’t tell hahaha
still not better than beans and toast
We went and spent way too much money on Brazilian BBQ for my brother’s birthday. I wasn’t that impressed. I told my parents we can have normal (american) BBQ for my birthday. Get some burnt ends over some French fries with a side of sweet cream corn 👌🏻
about 5 seconds after that first bite... POW! that favor hits you right in the face!  After that its over. 😄
Simply MUST try cornbread with butter and honey spread atop it…
Cornbread should me warm, not so dry, with a little sugar in the recipe, and a good amount of butter on it. You set these poor kids up.   And British beans simply just can’t compare to bbq beans here.
Being from North Carolina USA. This video made me laugh hard. Very much enjoyed this video! Good stuff yall.
Are pickles not a thing in the UK?
Headmaster needs to be brought to America. Asap
I've noticed that the cornbread isn't slathered in butter and honey.
when i was in the uk, london... for 2 weeks, their food is really dull and the meat is not even tender. terrible food. they are cheap grass fed beef
They yearn for the flavor😭✌️
Texas bbq....real tx bbq is not just good food..it truly is an experience.
It's so much better with the bread toasted
business idea: Open an American  bbq food spot in England
Britain for the British
Mack looks like a mix of Brad Pitt and Guy Pearce in Memento
Favorite installment of ‘the British discover seasoning’ 😂 Totally kidding and said with love, full English and fish and chips are severely underrated
The kid with the dark eyes looks like the villain from “The Robinson’s” when he was a kid himself :0
Texas BBQ done justice.. TEXAS STAND UP!!!!!
That’s not the best looking Mac n cheese
NOW you know why Yankees are theeeee fattest in the world ...,the closest number 2 is a tie between Japanese  Sumo Wrestlers and Samoans.
damn why must i watch this when i have no food in thy fridge
I love eating the fatty parts!  That made me so hungry.  Have to go out tomorrow and get some!  And I love our Southern Sweet Tea.
I wish american kids are these polite😂
I feel sorry cor theae poor boys. They6taste buds just won't be the same. Good luck trying to eat Brittish food again. They went from bland city to flavor town, and theyll never be the same.....🤣
Also…what have they been eating all their lives?
It’s like these boys may one day lead a revolution in the UK dining experience 🥲
British teenagers opening their palate for the first time ever
British young Brad Pitt in the beginning
3:39 pickles😭
Literally mouth watering
Cornbread is a love hate bread.
American by birth. Texan by the grace of God! Love our BBQ & love smoking all our food. Yummy! Can't be beat!
In the UK I heard they are letting 16 and 17 year olds vote shows you how smart the adults are there not lol
One of the main reasons I miss my State, some of the best food on the planet, especially the balance of the Texas fold, though I typically just do brisket, bbq sauce, and pickles, and or pickled onions if they're there. I don't think I've done it with coleslaw somehow, though I like it, it usually goes with a pulled pork sandwich, but I can see it working, whatever taste good together to whoever is eating it pretty much works where I'm from. :)  Also, eating cornbread is way better with some butter, especially with beef stew or beans made with bone in pork, with the butter added to the stew or beans as well. And, possibly the best way for cornbread, with Texas chili, no beans. Oh, and last but not least, the slightly sweet jalapeño cornbread is the best. 👌
I hope that this is at the end of the day, or else all of these guys are going to be in food comas in their afternoon classes.
Got to put butter on that cornbread or honey
Try feeding these Brits some Chicago delicacies: Pizza Puffs, Italian Beef sandwich [including the combo with an Italian sausage in it], and the 3 styles of Chicago pizza:  South Side style [sometimes called tavern style]: Thin crispy crust, cut in squares, with a spicy marinara  "Chicago Style Deep Dish": This is the Lou Malnati's style, basically a pizza on cornbread  Stuffed Pizza: The Giordano's style where an inch of cheese is sandwiched between 2 thin crusts, with a 1/2 inch of crushed tomato sauce on top.  You can also give them Harold's Chicken with a lemon pepper dry rub and the trademark mild sauce.  Don't bother with the "Chicago Style" hotdog, that is a fallacy for tourists, true "Chicago Style" is "are you payin' for it? no? then put what I tell you...jagoff". However a Maxwell street Polish and Pork Chop sandwich is a must.
These are the luckiest high school kids in Britain.  Every so often these nutty Internet guys bring them amazing food
I misread the year thing for a sec and I thought what the hell are they feeding these kids in Britain to make em this grown
Someone give them a South African Braai
I like the fact that you came to the US and rode mammoth! One of the best mountains in the US!
Please bring the headmaster to america we love him!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
No way there highschoolers
Introduce them to smothered pork chops, they won’t live past 65 but it will be a life well lived. 👍🏾
Seeing those young chaps eating bbq 😋
Yeah none of that shitty ass beans and toast
I’m from the Georgia, and by far the best BBQ on Earth is deep in the heart of Texas! Southern “Home cookin’” comfort food is the glue of the old south.
I've never had any cornbread that I actually enjoyed, and I've visited half a dozen southern U.S. states in my lifetime, eating local variations on classic dishes in each. Southern biscuits though, especially when they're made with the special soft flour from the south, are in a league of their own. When my organization smokes pork ribs for our fundraiser BBQs, we smoke them with real mesquite logs for 4 hours, and I refuse to reveal the seasoning blend we use.
A cow is a cow no matter where you are unless you are in Japan.  Treat cooking it with respect.  Low temp, long cook over a smoker for the most wonderful tender meat!
Watching someone across the world try Texas BBQ and love it brings tears to my eyes
I'm from the deep south in Mississippi, and I absolutely hate cornbread. This video was amazing 😂
I think it is so funny that they have never had Texas Barbeque and they love it so! They are pretty smart! I am a native Texas and I love, love, love brisket, sausage and ribs! Bring it on!!!
I was REALLY hoping these boys would get some bread putting as a dessert. No BBQ platter is complete without a little dessert.
Now everyone understands why Americans are fat 😂❤
This is making me starving
This is so cute. The reactions are  perfect so happy they got to experience this. 😊❤❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😲🤗
Just out of curiosity, logistically, how are you bringing authentic southern BBQ to students in the UK?  Did you bring a caterer from the states to make it locally?
Haha ❤
welcome to Texas meat coma
I love these because the expressions on their faces of pure joy from our southern cuisine is the reason America is fat
Can’t believe they brought out the foldover!
It’s so heartwarming to see the smiles, the excitement, happiness & giddy laughter of how much joy they get from trying something new & it’s Delicious! We know. It’s an Experience!😂❤
Have them try in and out
Try Indian food
Born and raised in Houston Texas.  Love seeing these young guys loving TEXAS BBQ.
As a North Carolina southerner GET THOSE BOYS SO PULLED PORK
These kids look like they’re in heaven
You should let them try Indonesian food sometimes
I can imagine the difference due to our obsession with DELICIOUS BBQ . Can someone please get what’s his name some real cornbread ?
Lmao they gon be thinking about this meal for weeks🤣
Y'all are welcome
I feel like a lot of people typically like to eat cornbread with butter and honey
Get it together England ur foods are bland # flavour
FYI, most Americans don't eat baked beans on toast. We eat them as a side dish. Sometimes we make them with cut up hotdogs added to them... which is also really yummy.
Corn bread is good when it's warm and has butter spread on it, or if dipped in baked beans, or grilled on a griddle and used to scoop up over easy/over medium eggs.
After this video, the headmaster was looking for jobs strictly in Texas 😂
Cornbread should not be compared to croutons or bland lol so that cornbread must be bad lol
As a southerner, playing Zadok the Priest as the brisket is brought out is fully appropriate. It's pretty much the soundtrack that plays in my head when the smoker lid opens on a perfectly cooked Boston butt!
This alone makes me proud to be an American 😂
I'm so happy! 🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧
Sublime? Lmao. Too funny man
I love watching these kids enjoy American BBQ 😅
where did you find proper BBQ in Britain to share with these guys?
Now y'all can't be titling the episode "British Highschoolers try Texas BBQ!" and casually having the headmaster take part, cos the way I thought a teenager had a ROUGH life at the beginning...
Mack kinda looks like Brad Pitt, espeicially around the brows and eyes.
That cornbread is too fluffy and drie
That’s hilarious they gave the black kid in the thumb pic the biggest piece of barbecue rib. I guess no matter where you’re at in the world, Black people still love, ribs, and fried chicken.
The teacher is having the best day of his life
3:39 dude when you said pickles and they both looked up with joy😂😂
LOL It looks like the Headmaster is changing his travel plans as we speak.
Seriously though Texas BBQ is good (Hi I’m from Texas, totally no Bias 🙂)  Even the locally owned Texas Grocery store Chain has a Mini BBQ restaurant in it and a bunch of BBQ related stuff (not even joking about that, they even sell stuff to use for your bbq)
This is why we fought a revolution, so we wouldn’t we burdened by beans on toast for breakfast.
4:29 I love how they’re stuffing their mouths so full because it’s SO good that they’ve completely forgotten they’re being interviewed and need to be able to talk. 😅 This Texas mama and teacher LOVED watching the kids eat!
Sadly, as a Texan, i hate cornbread since my grandma passed away. She made the best cornbread ever
I’m really curious as to what a home cooked meal looks like in England.
"I want to go to america" -all the kids "No kid, even the food's not worth it rn" 😭😭😭😭 (most of us are sane I swear)
The head master is so cute and funny.
10:40 “I don’t feel like I can eat food here anymore.” 😂 oh man- so glad they got to experience the magic of southern BBQ.
The us might have its problems. But man, we have the best food in the world. Ill die on that hill. The best part of our immigrant history.
Taste the freedom twinks
Not everyone can make cornbread bruh the only good moist cornbread I had was from my grandad everyone else was dry and flavorless
As a texan I might head on over to england and start a new business 😂
give them louisiana seafood boil next.
love these videos!!!! these kids are amazing and funny.
When the headmaster sighed, I heard him. We hear you man, come to America.
That kid's got it- the roll or the cornbread is to mop up all the flavor left on your plate!
As a Texan this makes me so happy cause I love almost all of this stuff
So many people watch these kids eat and are dying to bring them to the US so we can feed them lol
I really like these shows, it shows the food we have, around our nation, is liked and appreciated around the world, I was shocked to find out that 95% of the world, didn’t know what a peanut and jelly sandwich was, thought we all did, 😂😂
They Get To Now Know How Luka Feels 😂😂
I thank Jolly for adding some perspective on why us Americans say what we do about British foods lol
Never felt so proud than when Brits transcend to another level of consciousness because of Texas BBQ and smoked brisket!
These young man will never know joy in food again
4:40 pause. Lol
I never thought watching somebody eat bbq would be so entertaining.
Y'all learning why we don't have free healthcare
I’ve never seen the headmaster look as serious as he did after eating the sausage😂 something he’s probably eaten all his life just elevated to another level
Here in Texas, we don’t eat cornbread with our BBQ.  We usually eat cornbread with butter and a bowl of pinto beans.
Extremely entertaining 👏 ❤
These students must all be extremely gifted if they’re in High School at 7-9 years old!
the fact that they all put the beans on the bread cracks me up
In my part of Texas we say it’s a “foldover” and single piece of bread making a half is called that ❤ those sweet young men!!
They needed an Arnold Palmer as the drink 🔥
They needed an Arnold Palmer as the drink 🔥
I personally only like cornbread with Texas Chili or a pinto beans
Now you know why we say Don’t mess with Texas. Also, cornbread can be very tasty. Don’t put sugar in it, and cover it in butter.
Don't play with Americans. We know war and food !
Brits talk crazy..... 😂 "lovely" and "sublime".
Try more regions of BBQ please
Get you a biscuit to eat with that meat boy😂
It is amazing 😂
Watching Brit’s get their minds blown by typical Tuesday lunch makes me sad for them and their beans
I’m so mad that no one told them to eat the beans with the cornbread instead of the white bread. You gotta put cornbread in the right situation to get the most out of it 😂
Pickles in a milkshake is a crime against shake itself holding a tear watching
Now lead those poor kids to a proper Brazilian "churrascada" and let them stuff their face with proper meat.
The bark is the best
WAS a fan ....WAS .... NOW YOUR JUST A COMMERCIAL
Next day they have to go back to their beans and flappywillits
Texas BBQ is so great you will eat until you get the meat sweats. 😆 I am from Texas. ❤
Is that Dave, the captain of Dave?
I'll be the first to admit that sweet tea can be too sweet sometimes.  But that looked like it was practically water and they were complaining it was too sweet.  It's a wonder they could hold down the rest of it with palettes so sensitive.
Also, you can't help but wonder where Josh & Oliver got those Texas barbecue foods to England. Did they simply pack those foods up and brought them back with them?
I get the mac and cheese, it's not for everyone, I like it but the cornbread I'm guessing was dry. It should be a little sweet and with butter or like some said, to absorb the juices from the meat. My mouth is watering, I rarely get to enjoy that stuff, it's a definite treat.
Goddamn it algorithm, ya got me. After all the clips im finally clicking on the full video. I'm satisfied
😂i wonder how hard a whole brisket would be to buy in the UK
The disrespect towards that cornbread jk
This boys are growing to fast 😅
To be fair, I always slather my cornbread in a ridiculous amount of butter
Y’all didn’t have good cornbread if there’s no flavor or is bland.
This is why us Americans are big backs 😭
They forgot the butter and honey for the cornbread!  It’s no wonder most didn’t like it.  Having been to England, I must say, our food must feel like they died and went to heaven!b😊
WHEN WILL YOU TAKE THE HEADMASTER TO THE US WITH YOU??!!??  We demand it.
😂😂😂 u can tell the lil boy has had an epiphany,really expresses it with the googly eyes.then takes it home with the "much better than normal sausages".wholesome video ❤
I came especially for the “that’s lovely” kid
How did they get brisket into Britain for these kids to taste?
i love this channel as an American😂🔥
I love videos like this. As an American we are criticized for being overweight. Then you all try our foods like this and you see why. Amazing BBQ or creole or comfort food like meatloaf and you all love it. You can see why we eat lots of this stuff.
"Have u not eaten in a week" 😂😂😂 That lil boy was enjoying that food sooooo much
This is why US has obesity issue, their food is too delicious and it comes in a big portion. I kid you not that a portion of US can be shared by 2-3 kids from Asia ane they will say it is a normal portion.  I can see that I'll easily gain extra 5 kg in a week trip in US.
Trying something like this for the first time is like getting repeatedly sent through a flavor heaven and back
That cornbread needed reheting under the salamander with some honey butter
Great show and live they way the love the food and honest in what and how each items taste. Boys are so respectful….👍🏼
gonna give these chaps the itis
No compliment is better than a Food compliment.
Should have had them try the chili with the cornbread
Now thats the kind of education that will prepare these young gentlemen for future success 😂❤
7:29 “You gonna eat 'yo cornbread?”😅
Impressing these british middle schoolers has never maid me more proud to be a texan 😅
As a life long Texan , i can do without the cornbread as well!
I hope no one had anything to do after this because the coma id gonna hit!!!
Y'all funny and y'all eat food with such gusto. 😊 Oh, who ever said they didn't like the crust on the Mac and Cheese 🥺. It's the Holy Grail of Mac and Cheese Dishes. And Mac and Cheese can never be too Cheese. 😋
Welcome to America boyz . Now . Jolly is more then capable of paying for all the expenses to bring yall boyz to the home land lol and let yall try it all . Proper food as yall would say 😂😂
As an American with a few British (English) roots I love this
Still Some Pink in there. But at least it's Mostly Well done.
Buddy said “I don’t think I can even eat here anymore” 😂😂😂
Mack just looks like brad pitt in fight club
Some of these kids are like 10. How are they in highschool?
Give those poor kids some butter for that cornbread 😂
Born and raised in America I’ll say it … corn bread sucks
11:39 "Ah you want it to be more bland?" 😂
All These kids will move to America someday just for the food
I could be wrong, but that looked like Jiffy cornbread, or something similar...which would explain why they didn't like it. I'd be disappointed, too.
That tea didn't look strong enough
Mack can NOT be 9 that boy looks 15
The Texas fold is the foil to “it’s all going to the same place”. Basically “it all needs to arrive at the same time”
0:12 we have a future American citizen who will permanently reside in Texas!! Lets go! As a Texan, please move here and stay here! We would love to have you and you will be treated and loved immensely. Do it! You can go to a BBQ restaurant at least once a week forever!

The beans at the end were hilarious
that curly lil kid is so cute and lovely
Poor kids. Stuck with mushy pees and bland gravy
Something tells me Harry is a modern rendition of what Ollie would have been in his childhood
Corn bread requires butter
American bbq is the greatest food on earth.
Can you imagine their sensory overload? They've been eating bland food their whole lives 😂😂😂
whereas im here in the philippines drooling as i eat chicken tenders😔😔
Loving the Mammoth Mountain shirt!!
once again, british people are left legitimately dumbfounded and speechless by food that actually has flavor
Wow! Please keep these vids coming….the whole family loves watching them. Ty SO AWESOME!
More proof that America is #1.
Across the pond enjoying bloody American BBQ thank God for the internet.❤😊
I enjoyed watching them enjoy themselves!😂😂😂 plugged up to  the matrix!😂
As a native Texan I throughly enjoyed this!  I literally just took off the smoker homemade beef jerky.  Nothing better than good Texas BBQ.  And for the record I’ve never liked cornbread either.
I, as an experience bbq eater, have yet to see anyone put a bit of sauce on the Mac n cheese. It is delightful.
The excitement over pickles is the sweetest thing ever.
If the kids got some shitty grainy ahh cornbread, trust that ain’t us. I hate the grainy/bland cornbread too. Famous Dave’s tho, OMG that shits fire
It’s absolutely sublime 🗣️🔥
Butter on the cornbread? If not that’s criminal
I’m from Texas East Texas at that where bbq is king 👑 I really enjoyed this video and some of them eat like a true Texan but down here we take a nap after that 😆
You gotta put butter on cornbread its too dry
@jolly the YouTube channel ILaidThisBrick is stealing your content by reposting your videos
That headmaster thanks god every day that Jolly are his former students 😂
This is great
Put butter on the cornbread!
I am not offended by that British baby's cornbread remark. Many, many even in the South get that wrong. So yeah, it could have been awful 🤷🏾‍♀️, lol.
I always have my cornbread with butter and honey to reduce that dryness
Where is the brisket from
This is so wholesome ❤
BRO THIS ONE IS FAKE ALSO  Edit: why is there so many fake jandel accounts   Bruh
The curly hair little guy on the left is legit loving the food in its entirety and his expressions are amazing
Excellent ❤
nah can't watch this! it's making me hungry
I hate cornbread
that poor brisket
Love watching this page the kids 😅😅😅
Makes me smile.
They obviously didn't add honey to the cornbread.
That's what we Americans do, we take stuff that other countries do and we say "Hold Our Beer, we can do that better."
I feel genuine JOY and happiness seeing people enjoy things!!
Two words - meat sweats 😂😂😂
It feels good to see black British people, i feel like a outcast in America being of scottish
Please take Mr. Smith to eat Texas bbq in the US
They’re all boys….
Gotta say, dissapointed they dont like the corn bread. But there is a reason it comes in two major varieties, a sweeter moister variant meant to be eaten straight or with a little butter.  Or a dryer variant, that outright requires butter if eaten straight and is more often eaten dipped into stews or beans or anything with a bit of moisture.  Both are good, but you can get some debates as people like one variant more than another.
To be fair that cornbread looked awful
VERY glad to see the cornbread fall flat. as a texan, it's a waste of ingredients.   13:40 this kid in specific knows what he's talking about.
Did i read that right ? High schoolers? I looked like that when i was 5th grade middle school
They get the meat sweats?😂
When you all are ready to do "An American eats American food in Britain" let me know, I'm up for the challenge!
this is peak react bros from UK LOL
If they think regular cornbread is bland, have them try jalapeno cornbread or cornbread made w/creamed corn.  also good with butter, honey or maple syrup.
You HAVE to eat cornbread with honey!!!
Just imagine the kid that missed school that day......
Jj don’t look 9😂😂
Watching them eat Southern food with their hands just makes me so happy.... ❤
Now I got a hankering for some BBQ! It looks finger licking good! 🤤
They're so polite the selection of British English is wonderful. You can tell these are educated schoolers. Sorry Brits Americans don't eat beans on toast. Canned baked beans are pretty bland.
In the North we call those Handwiches I'm happy to see you eat that BBQ with your hands
why didnt then  mix the  corn bread with the  beans   like most of us  texans do
If you gave this to a pilgrim or a cowboy Texas barbeque I would assume there would be similar reactions
Why aren’t you putting butter and (maybe) honey on the cornbread?
That kid Harry had a out of body experience the way he closed his eyes and opened em wide af 😂😂😂
Wait till they find out they could get some of this AT Buc-ees
They should put them with the 3 🇮🇳 India guys that would be something else
BBQ is the only good thing coming out of Texas these days, unfortunately.
In that kid's defense, cornbread is better before the meal, and slathered with cinnamon butter 😂
Pork ribs should also fall off the bones. But wonderful video.
If other countries had food as good as america, america would not be the fattest country anymore.
I absolutely loved this video from start to finish!!! And Im a Colombian that has never tasted either british food nor the kind of American food they are tasting here, but man what a joy to watch kids being mind blown by flavor!!!
Texan here. You are always welcome. BBQ is just 1 thing southerners excell at. Want crazy food? Get in goo with a black family from alabama. You will never know better food. Texas will hit you with the Texan/ Mexican/ Asian fusion quick if you arent careful. Despite what the world thinks of us, we are a melting pot of cultures like New York or Cali. We'll be seeing ya'll.
Highschool kids with mexican food!
The adorable little seven-year-old with curly hair, Harry, will grow up to be a foodie. That is, if he makes it out of the UK.
Y'all should let them try Hawaiian food or San Diego's Mexican food 🤌🏾🔥
You know honestly someone who is a good cook could open a couple of these places and make money!!
Serving cornbread without butter on it while it’s warm is a sin
😘 When the time comes...You should take a New batch of High school grads to America on a BBQ 🍖Tour across the USA 😛
Have they tried soul food? Give them soul food and have them slumped for the rest of the day 😂
Seeing British people experience flavor make me happy
America serves up any kind of ethnic food you can imagine. So if you come to America, don't limit yourself. I was raised in the south/Georgia and think it's the best of the best,  country cooking aka soul food. I live in the southwest now, in Las Vegas, also the "9th Island" of Hawaii. We also have our own China town and Korea Town. I have to say, Korean is my favorite.  If you have a taste for Jamaican Thai, Indian, Venezuelan, all here. It's pretty amazing to have all these cuisines at your door!
is it bad if every time they said something was good I started thinking of the national anthem
But it's going to be a tough day in the refectory tomorrow boys after experiencing this! lol
Corn bread is best when it’s juicy and has corn in it
As a southerner, We LOVE our cornbread.
I'm assuming they had the more savory style of cornbread judging by how they described it. That style can be pretty bland sometimes if not made right but if you add something else to elevate the savory factor it's much better, plenty of salty butter too of course. I still prefer the sweet cornbread overall though because I'm addicted to sugar. I think they may have preferred that version as well if only because, while the former version can act as a better pallet cleanser, the sweetness from the latter adds to the already salty sweetness of the bbq.
This Chanel is so refreshing in such a hateful world
Now yall know why we are Obese 🤣🤣
Are monty and freddy siblings or something? They look so similar and love the vibe
im in 7th grade and the only thing i know is classic bavarian/german barbecue or "grillfest",and its SO ´good u have to try it
I smoked three racks of pork back ribs, sweet and spicy style, for 4th of July last week for my family and a handful of neighborhood kids that are friends of my sons. I smoked and wrapped them for about 4 hours, and some of the bones slid right out of the meat when I went to slice them. We ate an entire rack without anyone talking much - even my wife got in on the action, even though she's not a huge fan of smoky flavor (for sides I did grilled pineapple slices, corn on the cobb and a green salad) and soon enough there was just a pile of totally clean pork bones on the cutting board.  "Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it's a start" -Anthony Bourdain
‘Murica
My dad taught me this,If the meat slips off the rib,it’s not cooked all the way.i remembered this when they tried the ribs
The brisket is like if your waiting hours in a line for a slide at a waterpark for the best slide that last 20 seconds
Also I Gotta Say ~> favorite parts are the "Are You Lying?" ~ "He's Not Lying" & The Look on those faces when Some1 suggested Pickles! 🤣
I'm Born in TX ~> raised/living in Arkansas ~> & I'm Jealous 🥴. I'm Around That 24/7 & I'm Friggin Jealous Right Now 🤣🥰❤️‍🩹
fine I'll watch the full video now after watching ten shorts😭🤣
The dude with the dark curls is having a spiritual experience. He is in another world.
As a born and raised native Texan, I've never really felt the full-throated pride that a lot of other Texans feel. I don't really find it all that virtuous to be stubborn and dusty. However, the one thing that will occasionally bring patriotic tears to my eyes if the thought catches me on the right day... Is how good we are at making barbecue
No way that kid mack is 9 years old!
Shout out to that little one bean curly haired eloquent dude! My fav commentary
How do you get the food to the school so they can try it?
Whenever they do these type of vids the kids react like they haven't ate in 2 weeks.
BBQ is a gift from God and the South.
I lived in California all my 54 of life ..but left because of  liberal Democrats ruined my state and moved to SC and I got to say ...best ever brisket and ribs here !!!! I'm Hispanic and I love American food  , But I do have to say EASY has nothing on West Hispanic food which I do miss 😢
I can definitely get the reactions to the baked mac and cheese, I've always found it so overrated compared to regular mac and cheese made with shredded cheese. It's too dry and bland for me, no matter who makes it.
Who forgot the honey and butter for the cornbread?  Missed the plot. on that one!
I don't know why but I think it's funny that the black kids from england have never tried Texas barbecue before 😅
Im from Texas and this just makes me so happy 😂
Dear British friends: Texas Barbecue is a misnomer. Barbecue evolved from barbacoa, a Spanish ter for cooking develoed by natives and Spanish in the Americas. Today my people in Texas and the southwest continue to slow cook BBQ in brick ovens or pits in the earth. Our African-American brothers in the South also know great BBQ. To say Texas BBQ is like saying Midlands yorkshire pudding or Liverpool Toad in a Hole.
Austin Texas Born & Raised!!! I’m so happy yall like the bbq.  Please make honey butter cornbread bc that fell apart too easily. Everything else was good. We also do a sweet baked bean with no bbq, southern green beans & southern banana pudding
12:35 Owen Wilson Cameo 😂
2:34 he is not lying got me 🤣🤣🤣
2:09 that music isn't added in btw. It just plays when British people are nearby.
funny how they saw beans and automatically they put it on bread lol
As a born Texan I couldn’t be even more proud of you guys 😂 for loving our food ! Yall made all of us proud lol
Texas fold is what I call my girl’s love handles
Cornbread is a tough one, there is some really good and moist cornbread and then there is the really dry cornbread, it sounds like they got the dry bread
All these poor British children have never had flavor in their lives!!!
Here I am eating reheated leftover Kraft mac and cheese while watching British people eat real quality American food. Idk how I got here today
This all looks pretty good but you can tell it was made in the UK.
These children will never know peace at dinner again.
That child just cleared war on all of the South when he said to never make cornbread again 😂😂😂  I think they just got bad corn bread is what it is
13:41 as a southern american i don’t like cornbread either. i agree with the boys it is bland and i don’t like the texture
Texas bbq is peak bbq…
As a vegan and a Texan, I thoroughly enjoyed watching these kids enjoy BBQ so much. 😂
The kids mop and bucket analogy was very imaginative
Meatloaf and mashed potatoes
We need a tri tip or pizza or meatball sub or type of new york sandwhich
7:56 this explains how I feel about cornbread but him being English makes it sound much better. Me: “it’s dry and taste like ass”
😂😂😂 I love this. Those kids got the best of the best from what it looks like. That was some delicious looking bbq
I love that they all put the beans on the bread! lol so British I’ve never done that a single time in my life.
People whose ancestors are from subsaharan Africa are not “British”
noooooo they do NOT want to come here nooo……
Most Americans that I know don’t put bread crumbs on top of the Mac and cheese. It is not needed.
I was taught to try all sorts of foods before I turn my nose up to it. This is so refreshing to watch. Especially the gentleman who said he doesn't like pickles but is on for the ride.
Ngl Freddie’s cut is cooked
I’m hungry now!  Let’s go to Mission Bbq , Famous Dave’s bbq yeah baby yum
THEY ARE SO HAPPY 😂😂😂❤❤
Lifelong Texan here... burnt ends are Kansas City bbq, not Texas. Brisket, in the other hand...
I teared up watching this....why?
Who gets to participate??
The headmaster looks healthier and healthier every time he’s on the videos 💪🏻
2:50 boys know something 😂🔥
you gotta put sugar in the bread fam 😭 ruined it
I live in Texas AND work at BBQ joint so this is my everyday.
Slaw on the sandwich is an East coast thing. As a Texas native I've never heard of a Texas fold but to each their own.
10:00 are we not gonna acknowledge that he put a pickle on the beef sausage 😭✋I love him sm lmaoo
These kids are HUNGRY! Feed them kids 😂❤
SIAP ... I looked but could not find answer ..... How did JOLLY get the BBQ across the pond?
The British stole the spices and the South used ‘em.
As an American, I never liked cornbread personally lol
That southern cuisine is so high protein
They need some KC Masterpiece or Sweet Baby Ray’s. The cornbread is supposed to be warm with honey butter melted in it.
Us Brits love a barbecue, we are all about the meat but for Texans it seems to be a delicious religion that they do best.
I’ve literally never heard ANYONE call that a “Texas fold” 🤣
Imagine you are eating some food, and every bite is... Heavenly! So you need to take some big bites to get more flavor, and all you hear is "Woah! That was a BIG bite!" Overall great video though! 10/10
Meat sweats!!!
Oh no that is the wrong mac & cheese. Please bring them some real Black southern mac & cheese. Also, beans peppers and ground beef if so much better.
The boys are adorable. Bring them some proper southern cornbread (the one they had looked dry) or homemade biscuits. Never met a male of any age to resist southern cornbread or biscuits. My 3 yr old even gets so giddy when I make boxed cornbread lol @2:43 & @2:29 😂
A southern will punch you in the teeth if you tell them to never make corn hread again 😂 I know this because im southern and when he said that i had the immediant want to shoot my guns.
For the Mac & Cheese, one thing I like to do when I make it is turn it into Smoked Brisket Mac & Cheese!  "Meat Church BBQ" here on YT has an excellent video and recipe.  I guarantee they'll LOVE that Mac & Cheese!  Also, there's only one way to make this experience even better for all of these kids and headmaster:  it's time for a trip down to Texas to Snow's BBQ!  Part of the experience is the smell of the meat cooking and the smell of the wood.
I feel like theyd like not regular cornbread more. In cooking class in middle school we used to make cornbread with cheese on top, or with jalapeño and cheese inside the bread... im getting hungry 😋😋😋
This was hilarious.😂😂😂😂 The honesty.
no offense but that brisket looked dry
these little british boys immediately putting the beans on a bit of toast is frying me
The only brits to truly know flavour
Love your guys vids
What kind of heathen eats cornbread without butter?
I need to know where this amazing food was from! Love the school videos, and the kids and headteacher are a joy to watch 😊
I would love to see y’all on good mythical morning
3:53 Don't chew with your mouth open, son. lol!
Next, you guys should try Carolina barbecue! Pulled pork sandwich with the classic vinegar sauce and coleslaw and hushpuppies (cornmeal fritters) on the side. A completely different style of bbq, tangy and sour and sweet, but still absolutely delicious!

1. How did that kid never try pickles? 2. How did he get that they were cucumbers right away?
HARRY 😂😂😂😂❤ I LOVE HIM😂😂😂😂
How can the world not use the internet and buy a smoker to make this themselves?
I’m from the north but i love cornbread with butter or even honey jalapeño cornbread should have been given but any southern bbq I love though
ive turned into a waterfall
We love our cornbread with our pino, beans and fried potatoes
Yes, humans are carnivores.
Parents should keep their kids away from these two....
I wish I could eat it I have never eat all of them like none of them😂😂
1:02
1:21 Mack (Right one) looks like brad pitt
i loved that kid with the curly hair!! he just has the most genuine reactions and is up to try anything lol "Thats lovely" lmao
Everything is better with bread 😂.  We love the headmaster ❤
That mac and cheese looks so dry. Can't blame them for not liking that one
As a texan. This fills me with pride.
The knife and fork😂
These babies haven't lived 😂😂😂😂
Native Texan here. I approve of this video.  About the cornbread. In my house we make it with buttermilk, bacon drippings in the batter, and half cornmeal half white flour. That’s the secret to a great cornbread.
“British highschoolers” and there’s multiple blacks. They are not British..
How can you not like pickles? Most woman especialy CRAVE them.
Im American, love my bbq but im shamed by my fellow Americans for not liking fat and eating it well done..no pink.
I wish we had the beautiful accents and proper speaking in America like in UK and Australia.
It is fun to see you try our foods...BBQ is American, you dont know many who doesnt have a blackstone, grill, and smoker on their deck
Honestly you should do a seafood boil. It’ll be real goood
I usually soak my cornbread in hot pepper juice. Should have had them try that!
I remember the first time i had cole slaw on my smoked pork sandwich as a Midqesterner born and bred
Cajun food!! Boudin, crawfish étoufée, red beans and rice, jambalaya, gumbo, maque choux, andouille sausage, po’ boys, beignets, pralines, king cake — yum!!!
Take the kids to American 🇺🇸 on a field trip an try the food
Why they all boys
I love 💗 this episode cause I love thy like soul food
These kids are so adorable. I’m so happy that they try all of this delicious food! Their  lives are forever changed! Love their fun attitudes as well.
Whenever I eat barbecue, I am so happy to be me!
Can they try mexican food next like pozole, tamales, maybe something with nopales, and like mole or something that isnt your basic tacos. If they decide tacos at least like al pastor or barbacoa
You guys should go to reilys farm in cali it has a bunch of American history!!!! Plus yummy food and occasionally they do dancing and stuff . They basically take you to colonial American. With people dressed up in character, archery , ax throwing , colonial doll making , yarn.
They didn't put honey and butter on the cornbread, otherwise they would've LOVED it!!!
@jolly I love your content! How do you guys get fresh food for the head master and students? I know BBQ can be made fresh, but I’m curious about the fast foods you’ve had them try.
The USA will conquer England through the power of flavored food.
As a flawda women im going to get some bbq tomorrow 🤣🤣🤣
Eating brisket is kiwis being hugged 😂
0:12 18, my friend
Is flavor illegal in the UK
I'm an American from Wisconsin and even I haven't had Texas BBQ before 😅
I can only imagine the look on their parent faces when they told them , mom, dad we're going to do a video tomorrow involving American food , Texas bbq!
I feel like the headmaster could have his own “mocumentary” show where he is the headmaster of this school that he once attended when he was younger
The kid in the wrist band looks like he should be the headmaster.he looks like hes 32 lol
What do these kids eat for this stuff to be amazing to them because as a proud Texan this stuff is kind of normal
Move to Texas it’s amazing
As a Texan it is insane that these kids have never ate a rib before.
TEXAS BABY!!!
As a Texan, the look on their faces are awesome!
I grew up in south Texas eating brisket and I have always told people theirs nothing like it . And they never believe it till they do .
13:38 i wasn't exspecting that 😂
Cornbread.....slice it open...insert butter......eat plain or with jelly jam or anything else......use it to soak up the juice from beans or anything else.... good to the last drop.
Do they not have pickles in England? Cuz I would die. Literally drink straight pickle juice atleast once a day
Love these Boys ❤
I absolutely love the kids reactions It's blowing my mind! But what's really blowing my mind is the guy across from him is wearing a mammoth mountain ski area shirt. Where I used to live. That is mind-blowing
I wonder how he made the cornbread.
𝗖𝗮𝘃𝗮𝗻!!!!!
𝗠𝘆 𝗴𝘂𝘆
𝗛𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗬 𝗕𝗥𝗔𝗗𝗦𝗛𝗔𝗪
British choose gayness than flavor thats why they dont have this things 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm an American from VA, and i love BBQ! And to watch these guys enjoy it for the first time is awesome
Absolutely LOVE all of the high school videos! Their reactions to the American foods are priceless. 🥰
The headmaster is a kindred spirit  😂
Where's the banana pudding?
bring the headmaster and the small kid who head almost exploded to america
Please do this in the Netherlands
I know the standard is Honey with cornbread, but maple syrup and butter is my personal favorite 🔥
My mouth is mesmerised
8:19 There’s no honey butter on any of their cornbread.  But glad you didn’t make them eat it with corn kernels still in it.
Don’t talk about my corn bread lol
I feel so sad for the people of England. Their food sucks so bad and they have no idea. 😂😂😂
American here, cornbread is very subjective. Everyone makes it a bit differently and it varies a lot in sweetness, dryness, etc. I’m actually not a huge cornbread person unless it’s quite sweet and not as dry. Also this video is making me so happy and now I want barbecue for dinner lol. It sounds like the UK needs some American BBQ restaurants - once people tasted it they’d be lining up out the door!
That cornbread must’ve been trash. Cornbread is so good lol
The headmaster is the best!
Adorable. They get beans and it goes straight on the bread!
2:54 elite compliments mate
He is seriously concerned about not being able to eat here anymore 😂😂
This was amazing 🤣👏🏼. Future pro tip for cornbread, add butter and or honey to kick it up a notch😎
I thought they were going to sponsor his trip to Portugal....Would have been nice ...he is a school teacher
Is that young Brad Pitt 😮
Paaafect 😂😂😂
What you should have done is make them try cornbread with butter and honey
They need some REAL soul food!
Now they see  why we’re so fat lol
Lesson of the fay men just love bbq lol
We have wonderful smoked bar b q in Louisiana too! It’s my favorite food!
Where in London did they find this yummyness???
Petition for them to try Braum’s or Sonic from oklahoma!  👇
I am from Africa  I'd give anything just to find myself near these texas briskets..I'd eat till i drop 😂
Ruined these kids 😂
God bless america 🇺🇸
Proud Texan watching with pride
Wars won against England and the British Crown: 2 1776 - tea tax 2025 - food
Texas BBQ❤
yeah thats what i thought. They always be talking mad about our food online though
Corn bread is great just need butter and salt on it.
These kids bringing me so much joy i love this
The difference between these kids and the US kids is so stark its almost unnerving.  These kids use words like sublime, mesmerizing, lovely, astounding  Americans just say: fire, bussing, and other slang words.  Its like they cant speak in anything but colloquialisms
theyre gonna passout afterward...the itis
wait til they try memphis, NC, and KC bbq
superior food that may kill you...
Head master loves everything hands down 😂
The raisin kid shouldn’t get any, that was an offensive comment lol
Should’ve put honey on the cornbread
I wish there was a BBQ restaurant so I could get BBQ food like the Texas BBQ here in Columbia SC. I'm sooooo jealous!!! 😊
The children yearn for flavor although I still don’t get the beans on toast thing
So are pickles not a thing in Britain?
Their reactions are the best. Truly people who appreciate food.
1:22 dude on the right is not 9
May that kid find a truly delicious cornbread because idk what happened there 😂
Now have them eat soul food next
Now they know why Americans are fat 😂
He gotta have the right people making the cornbread
Nah they messed up when they said the British beans better lololol but most of the kids came around for the pit beans
In the nicest way possible these kids are the British student stereotype
That so called Mac n cheese looks Disghusting
Texan here. I second the cornbread comment. Thoroughly enjoyed this video and seeing everyone’s reactions!
A nap is needed after this meal
You have to find a place that puts vanilla pudding mix in the cornbread. It will change your life.
As a texan, I love a good juicy brisket along with a good potato salad 😋
No corn pudding for a side?? I’m curious if they’d like it.
As a southerner seeing them try bbq and enjoy it like it’s some type of holy meal. Bring tears to my eyes seeing them enjoy good old USA bbq.
Best. Reactions. Ever.
Love love love this!😂
There was no butter on that corn bread
they never had honey crackling bread that’s they prollem
Some homemade pastrami on that macaroni would be nice to see.
😂 I'm a Texan and I enjoyed watching the kids enjoy the big Texas meal
They ain’t get good cornbread
this is why most of America is overweight 😭
The headmaster is the best
wow they needa eat some jiffy cornbread 8:18
Texas BBQ? No way. Kansas City BBQ is the best.
Ain't even have BBQ sauce😂
Awh?! You’ve got to have cheddar jalapeño sweet cornbread.
As a southerner. You giving them the cornbread AFTER they ate everything else is a hate crime I'm sorry
Wtf is “Mackers” though 😂
How long was the nap they all took after this feast?? Lol
That was not my grandmas corn bread. That needed a lot of butter.
Yall need to get them some fried pickles, fried boudin balls, and put some of that cornbread in warm milk
"A texas fold"? Fine Sir that's a brisket sandwich.
We all have the right to our own opinions but when you dog on corn bread I get a little upset that stuff is great with a little butter too omg
Do the kids get to take rest home to their parents???
Sure offer people who only season their boiled food with a bit of salt and give them well seasoned food and they are going to love it.
With those intense reactions from the kids, Josh and Ollie slowly realized that they’re spoiled for having BBQ multiple times in the south.
take the speed away from that one kid, we all know who
10:00 He put the pickle on the sausage those two need rehab
I love BBQ pulled pork and ribs.  I think Memphis style is my favorite although I really like some i had in Atlanta as well that was quite unique.
I wanna make them a better cornbread because that looked a Lil dry from here 😂 once they have the right one, they'll be hooked ❤
Who wants to try British food guys!?........ guys?....... anyone?
I feel like this when I eat GOOD BBQ too. It's a full sensory experience. Especially some smoked meattssss WWoooooooooooooooooooooWEEEE!!!
This is making me want bbq for breakfast YUMMMMMM
Wrlcometo America Boys! Land of the BBQ
And then those poor kids wearing suits will def have “The Meat Sweats” after that
Stg American food has to be the best from Chinese to Mexican all the way to the bodegas n our halal
“You’re the funny one!”  peak Ollie compliment 😅
As an American who lived in the south for 5 years, i never got used to their sweet tea. They literally just call it tea and i would drink it in a 50/50 ratio with unsweetened tea or even water if that’s all i had cause it was just too syrupy
I expect them to say "blimey gov"
Those little Brits are in suits. Why? Oh, for the video video, of course.  Shessh
please bring the head master to the US, he deserves a trip. the views on the videos would be insane
I really enjoyed this being from New York City 😂 glad you love our foods from America ❤
I am a teacher.  Why isn’t my job THIS good?!  😂
😫 how bad is their food omg
I’m glad they portrayed our food at its best and didn’t slap a bag of doritos and some mt. Dew on a table.
Why does harry the 9 year old looks like a kid in monster house i think? Ahahah the gloomy one with baggy eyes
Truly heartwarming! Love to the brits from America! We may not have tea for you but we have all the brisket you want!
They eating that dry ass cornbread without any butter🤣🤦‍♂️
Who is he using a fork 😭😭😭
it’s amazing how most of them but the beans in the bread lol
can i have a plate pretty please!!!
lol they too cute they tore that meat up when i tell you i don’t blame them bbw good asf and whoever cooked it made it look so good
WTF? England schools obviously practice segregation!! Why r they so woke & racist? 🤔
I don’t like the cornbread either 😂
In a lot of black southern households we put cheese on top of the Mac and cheese and bake it instead of bread crumbs
I think they need to try sweet honey corn bread
Makes me wanna go to the uk and open a bbq restaurant
brits now know why we have a weight problem in the US
Harry knows whats up
Take that Tom Holland
Their sleeves getting close to the food is giving me anxiety.
The kids are hilarious, I love watching these
Great vid so glad they liked our BBQ so much. Loved how they "tucked in" and enjoyed the brisket, ribs, and bark! Cornbread here is so varied, I'd say he hasn't had the right recipe yet.
The cornbread needs butter and honey
The patriotic music in the background is everything... Lol
We know how to cook. 😊
If you can get a good sausage it’s the best thing on the plate
I’d hate to be born in the uk and know this type of stuff eludes me
Its like they never had flavor lmao
Texas cornbread is not the only cornbread! Deep south cornbread can be almost like cake or it can have cracklins in it to add flavor.
Thats not bread kid 😅
Watching British people discover Texas BBQ is like watching cavemen discover fire
These kids ages dont make sense. Tbe 9years would be our 15yrs old in America. The 7 ones would be our ten amd 11 year old
This should be titled "British teens find out why Americans are fat." Lol 😆
They need to try some New Orleans food 🍱. We got the best
Excuse me cornbread is so good!!🥲
This was fun watch while eating leftover ribs from the 4th of July today.
Cornbread needs  butter
I’m from Houston,TEXAS and trust me I feel ya…. 🫠🫠🫠🙌🏿
this video had me laughing the whole time
That looks delicious they are going to want to move now
Did em a great service not giving normal sausage but the one with cheese in it😮
When I was that age, going through puberty, constantly running around; if I came home to some barbecue food, I would literally eat so much. Good bbq chicken is my thing. And good coleslaw.
i’m from america and now i’m craving this SO BAD if you haven’t yet make them try funeral potato’s they’re soooo good
I really hope they didn't have to go to class after this episode. That food comma is about to be villianous.
I think the headmaster is secretly an American 😂
I gotta church up my cornbread either with butter or my favorite honey try that next time
Do y'all get it yet? Even a little? This is what we have access to... Daily! This is why we are fat
Bros got a mammoth mountain shirt🤙 and eating bbq😎
No, you don't want to move here now. The current federal government will probably send you to El Salvador or the new prison in the florida Everglades. He is destroying this country from  the inside out.  If you have money, he will take it all away.😢
the british people are like the funniest people u can ever meet
God Bless America but most of all God Bless Texas
Love seeing folks from outside the USA enjoying our food.
Those poor ribs were so stiff lol
Cornbread should never be dry! Never!
Born and raised in the USA, but never had Texas BGQ like this.  Looks heavenly.
In defense of cornbread, most cornbread you get is crap but there are sime really good recipes. My wife does one with creamed corn and it is crazy good. Cooked in a cast iron pan. It puts that garbage loaf of corn meal you made those poor kids suffer through to shame.
British food is bland and tasteless! So it's no wonder they love American food.
why do people continue to think breadcrumbs on mac and cheese is a thing?! it’s literally only a thing with select restaurants and pretentious places. normal southern style/bbq style mac and cheese just has a melted cheese top that’s browned. breadcrumbs are an unnecessary pretentious ingredient for 99 percent of americans.
Man, who made that corn bread?  Add butter and honey and it’s desert!
Im just an average american teen living in North Carolina and ts I have to say was sum funny ahh stuff because what they ate looked high quality, but like normal bbq lmao. It's funny to believe people don't even know abt bbq but for me it easily makes American food a top 5 cuisine, maybe even top 3. idk maybe thats just bias but I do love bbq, althouyugh u should have em try north carolina bbq, super underrated cuz of texas and not a  LOT different buut its soooo good.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😊👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
And ppl over there talk crap about ‘MURICA’s food  Edit: happy 4th of July
genuinely never had more fun watching a video coming from someone who lives in texas like i’ve never been more grateful to live here
The kid who kept calling it lovely is the winner here
Genuine question, how to you guys get the food there to be fresh like it comes out of the kitchen at the restaurant
Sweet tea is Trash.... yes. I live in America. Arizona.
Suits and ties... unusual for America. Would be great.
Truly Love This ❤️ ❤😊
GIVE THEM TEXAS TOAST!!!!
did you give the boys plain cornbread? What about spicy cornbread? with bits of pepper and corn in it, more substantial. Or sweet honey cornbread? Plain cornbread needs sweet butter/honey butter. Nah, if you want plain cornbread....you need to slather it in something. But their faces, yes, they enjoyed the BBQ.
There’s savory cornbread and sweet cornbread! If they don’t like one they usually like the other w
We don’t put  beans 🫘 on the bread 🍞 but I digress 🤷🏾‍♂️
Why exactly do they insists on still eating as if German planes are flying overhead…
If you come to America: texas, north carolina, Dolly Wood, and Louisiana for good crawfish boil
they finna be so sleepy lol
as someone thats lived all over the us at this point, i find these videos so funny. glad you enjoy some of our food. have they tried northeast diner food yet? alaskan seafood?
I wanna try that and i want these dudes from the us to try our boodog from mongolia ❤😊
Wanna see a vid where you take them to a Buc-ees Supercenter
From someone who was born in Michigan and moved to Texas at about 9, brisket is the end all be all! I totally live it and would take a bath in it every chance I got!! ❤😁😏🍖🥩🍖🥩🍖, plus cole slaw! YUMMMMMMM-Y! ❤❤❤❤
I know that “itis” hit them so hard after eating that😂
bro whats wrong w cornbread did u not get the jiffy mix jolly
You did them a disservice by not serving the cornbread with butter and honey.
Cornbread is an acquired taste, I used to hate it as a kid but I started appreciating it as I got older.
Where are some green beans or greens that have a little juice with some pork flavor to sop up and enjoy that cornbread even more??
Those pork ribs look thin, overcooked and dry! They don't represent us well. On the other hand, I do love how they appreciate how we cook our food. ❤😂
Brits trying flavor for the first time always brings tears to my eyes.
They call Americans fat and then when they eat our food, they're like "If this were in Britain I would eat it every day."
They better eat that shi up
It’s secondary school not high school
My stomach's doing backflips watching this😮
"Please never make cornbread again." based statement
Where the vegans at?
About the comment of cornbread tasting like paper: Poorly made cornbread does indeed taste like paper, but good cornbread tastes INCREDIBLE
These kids are going to be so sprung on Texas BBQ that everything else will be so disappointing.
*FUN FACT:* Germans that moved to Texas in the 1830's taught us how to slow cook meat. We took it 10 times further, but without Germans, Texas would not have the best meat on the planet you will ever have. 2 nations, 200 years, and now nothing on Earth can touch it. Not even close. On independence day from America, thank you, Germany. You earned and deserve this praise as well.
One of them is israel adesanyas son...
This is like watching aliens visit an uncontacted tribe that doesn’t know what bows and arrows are
America is not best at everything, but the Germans settled in a place called Texas and taught us "Slow cooking" and we took it 10 times further, and it would be hard to find a video out of 10K without the same reaction. There is food there even us Americans envy. Easily a top 10 bucket list try. It's life changing how good it is. Not kidding a bit.
“Everything is better with bread, innit?”  No. There is nothing that makes your garbage beans better. Absolutely nothing😂   Also, have any of them tried bbq/baked/pork and beans on this channel? They’ll never eat traditional beans and toast again
Just had some for July 4th… can’t beat a Texas BBQ baby…
Damn I’m hungry again
Well there's a way better recipes for corn bread that yall got so discount the corn bread
This is sad as a Texan to watch
Do the British not have pickles? I figured they were widespread.
You should've explained that they can get pulled pork mac and cheese and other types of corn bread too. BBQ is amazing, the spicier the better.
I like that they were definitely offered utensils, but 90% of the time they're just using their hands lol
‘Neva tried a Mac n cheese’
I really recommend sweet cornbread, especially with pieces of corn actually baked in! I find that it's more moist and just tastes way more impressive than regular cornbread!!
na the question of " what age can you legally move to America?" made the video and it was only 12 secs in
you have to put BUTTER AND HONEY on that cornbread lol
I’m from Alabama and agree with them wholeheartedly about that cornbread you fed them. That cornbread is bland and like eating dry grain. BBQ is all you need with BBQ like this. If you are wanting real cornbread, you come to the Deep South. And Texas is a category of their own. The south is really Alabama, Mississippi m Georgia, Tennessee. These sort of states. Here you will have cornbread so good it could be a meal all on its own. Not “cake cornbread”.
Thing is I do love brisket yet I moreso love grilled smoked ribs even better. I have grewup eating our southern states' smoked to grilled meals since my own southern state of Georgia's 1970s to 1980s childhood! Our southern states' food is my own comfort food for life! 😂 ❤
See that wasn't Jiffy cornbread 😂
Only in America only in America ❤❤❤ Long live the longhorns
Black people food is so good.
I bet they look forward to these videos, they get the best lunch ever
They’re so for real on the cornbread hate. I’m southern and it’s awful!
There's good BBQ in Kansas City too. Go KC!!
Which bbq joint is it from
shoulda gave them the honey corn bread
Happy Fourth of July 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I can hear the eagles every time the kids took a bite
It ain’t Memphis bbq!
Idk no why it fills my heart to see foreigners enjoy our food.😂
Everyone wonders how Americans are so fat until they have American food. Lol forgot i was watching this on the 4th as fireworks go off all around me
Brazilian BBQ FTW
Have them try Mexican food 🔥
Have you introduced them to “meat sweats”?
They 100% had the itis after this
I love how polite they are. 😊
I see that Mammoth Lakes shirt! That's where I live!
They turned into Americans right before our eyes
How tf do you get Texas bbq to England?
Happy 4th America!
What country are they in?
Happy 4th baby!!
The BBQ meat goes on top of the mac & cheese. That's the best way to eat it!
As someone born and raised in Texas it was amazing to watch this video. So funny and amazing to see their reactions. Now idk where they got that cornbread but I know whoever made it either ain’t make it well or it ain’t fresh😭
Hate us cuz they ain’t us
I'm so jealous, I don't even eat beef or pork or nothing like that. I'm so jealous man
I might die of hunger watching this 💀
There stomach is gonna feel like a brick after this 😭 at least they enjoyed themselves ♥️🤣
I love how you can see their own differences in taste with which items they do and dont like. Its so cool.
I also hate cornbread. My family thinks I'm crazy but I just never cared for it.
Brit food sucks compared to American food .
Harry needs a job on this channel. I would watch him discover new foods along with you any day. So emotive
Harry getting hit with the itis😂😂😂😂
Houston, Texas native here. It’s wonderful that people from other parts of the world get to experience authentic Southern cuisine, especially BBQ. I’m glad y’all enjoyed it boys 🫡
"Are you lying? He's not lying." They gone sleep good tonight 😂 😂 😂
cornbread with no butter is crazy work
Probably the most wholesome thing I've ever seen.  From Tennessee, God bless them.
have they tried mexican food? maybe from Peru?
How old are these young men? They look much younger than American highschoolers.
Man even our smart people can’t speak like that. Hats off to them being willing to try all those different foods. At their age, if someone had put a bunch of British food in front of me I probably wouldn’t have tried half of it. They were even polite about the food they didn’t like.
See the problem with the cornbread, was it wasn’t hot and have butter melted on it. Also need some cream corn or regular corn aaaaand needs to be cooked by a Southerner from the States more than likely lol. Everything else looked dope af
Here's to all us Colonists!
I was today years old when I realized year 9 is not their age but that they’re Freshman in HS🤦‍♂️
so why aren’t there any authentic BBQ joints in the UK? I’d rather us export this than McD’s.
Curly hair kid is having the time of his life
Only watching it his cuz I’m hungry and love your vids perfect combo honestly
As a professional cook, it brings me joy to see someone try something for the first time
You guys should do CAJUN FOOD that’s where it’s at, gumbo crawfish jambalaya seafood the whole shabang
Texas, GA, Mississippi, Tennessee are the states I’ve had the best BBQ in. Ima GA boy myself
“Everything is better with bread innit” is the most British thing that was said on this video iykyk😂😂😂😂
As a southerner they are making some good ole BBQ off the grill sound like a 5 star restaurant meal! This is funny asf😂😂😂😂 good content guys!
You should have provided napkins
Wibs 😂
0:35 why is the bread not toasted😭😭😭
I kno this was they're best day of life up 2 this point
Today is the perfect day to watch this beautiful experience 🥲 Happy 4th of July yall 🎉
Their drinks should have been served in red Solo cups
Lad said "i don't think i can eat here anymore" 😂young man, thats just the tip of the iceberg
He said not to make cornbread😂😂😂 their pallets just don’t know how sweet corn bread can be. That one looked a little starchy but it’s my favorite and I’m offended
Have a taste of the good life kids
Poor Brits snd their sad cuisine
Love seeing happiness through food! The kid breaking down the science of cornbread!, 😂
They are now honorary Texans. Welcome home gents.
Those poor boys are tasting things with seasoning and flavor for the first time 😂
Hopefully that one adult graduates soon
Look I’m as Texas as you get & I can tell the color of that sweet tea ain’t right 😂 you can’t judge our tea off of this 😭
They're not going to want to eat the regular food anymore 😅..
This just makes my Texan heart warm and fuzzy
I'm proud to ba an American
Please take the headmaster on a southern BBQ tour in the states! 🙏🏻 I would love to see him trying all the different foods the south has to offer!
This school must have some of the most well behaved students because I feel like part of getting to be in the room has a lot to do with how well they do academically, but also socially amongst their peers.
I like how articulate these children are.
Texan here, I can smell this video lmao. in fact I live next to multiple Michelin star BBQ places..not even joking. Texas BBQ is on another level and each place does it differently and it's like going on a trip each time and trying each places unique sides are so much fun.
These kids and their headmaster's reactions are all precious! Even the cornbread diss is still frikkin sweet, i dont mind it :D (and i love cornbread)
BARBECUE IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I LOVE BEING AN AMERICAN....NOTHING LIKE IT ELSE WHERE ON THE PLANET..
Wait a sec, you should change the title, some of these kids are way too young to be in high school 😅
U need butter on the Cornbread it also needs it to be warmmmm
ngl im a certified mac and cheese aficionado and im with them about the crispy breadcrumb top  most of the time it dries it out and adds not enough to sacrifice a lovely warm gooey mac n cheese but thats just me
Dry, plain cornbread?! Nah, jalapeño and honey butter!!
Invaded the world for spices. Uses none of them.
I can’t believe they’re eating with their hands.
I cooked at jim n Nick's and yes everday i could eat brisket 😅
It meant something to me the kids called out the breadcrumbs in the Mac n cheese
Yall Europeans always be asking why Americans are so fat its becaus we have alot of food like this in the us
Soooo British of them to immediately put the beans in the bread
That food looks really yummy and I would eat all of it too
making me hungry
These boys are so well-spoken!! ❤❤❤
Those boys just had their first mouthgasms
Kids Kingsman so adorable 😅..   (I wanna go to America now)💯🖤😂
"that's not for me, it's really bland" as opposed to your everyday meals as a brit?
3:39 does the uk not have pickles 😭
As a Southern here in the US I can tell you that you absolutely must put slaw on your barbecue. I’ve never seen anyone put pickles on there, but that might just be a Texas thing.
It’s such a delight to see their expressions as they try the food! I’m Canadian, and have yet to experience true American food yet! I hope to next year though!
How in the world did you get this to the UK?
For the kid who was adamantly against cornbread because it was "bland" I will say, there are different styles of cornbread too.  You guys probably got one of the more plain, dry recipes/mixes for it.
The children yearn for flavor lmaoooo
Don’t think we’re eating brisket all the time though. At least where I live in the US, it’s very expensive and due to how long it takes, I only have it maybe once or twice a year
As an America who was stationed in Europe and traveled the UK these kids are correct, British food is so bland
As an American watching this for the first time on the 4th of July, there’s nothing more satisfying than hearing those 2 British kids say “I can’t eat here anymore, I want to go to America!” 😂😂😂  I appreciate yall for sharing our food with these kiddos & Mr.Smith! These videos always make me laugh ☺️  Happy Independence Day yall!!! ‘Merica 🦅🇺🇸❤️🤍💙
I think with this BBQ I saw these boys turn into men right before my eyes.
Harry y7 kinda reminds me of goob from meet the robinsons
As a Native Spanish Texan, yall gotta try: Quesaberria Papusas (a GOOD papusa) Tacos, carnitas, beef fajita Spanish rice Refried beans Horchata or Agua de Jamaica
tbf that cornbread looked dry as hell
this is too hilarious hearing the vocabulary they're using 😂😭🤣
Korean Englishman season 2?
I was vegetarian for 17 years, texas BBQ was what made me a massive meat eater
Do Carolina BBQ next!!!
Where did you get the BBQ from? An American in London?  Flown over? Or a chef who lived in America?
Love the sweat skin as it crackles and your favorite tub or sauce.
In Texas, you would be hard pressed to find corn bread without Jalapeños, not so plain in Texas.
Now they know why Americans get so big 😂
Oh now i cant wait for the cook out today! 😂
The kid who said never to make cornbread ever again, bless your heart. He f you’re Texan you know
Ya’ll forgot the Fried Okra.
Brits thought we got fat off food that tasted bad
Not all cornbread is created equal lol
Conquering the world, one platter at a time.
The children crave flavor
Nah corn bread should be made with honey its the only way to eat it
The cornbread needs to be warm with butter melted into it.
these boys are about to learn why americas number 1
3:50 DO THEY NOT HAVE PICKLES UP THERE???
8:10 this is exactly it, that analogy is actually so accurate lol
If they think the cornbread isn’t good, it must’ve been a terrible cook because cornbread is phenomenal when made right
What they hated the most was the beans😂
This is probably the best British channel I’ve watch lmao
If he didn’t like the cornbread then it wasn’t made right. Also y‘all forgot green beans and brisket baked potatoes. Also those were not pickles 😂
As a southerner, I am deeply pleased at their response to our food!!! They are also adorable!!! ❤😂
I think the Head Master and Students are in a Texas BBQ food coma
1:20 Edmund meeting the White Witch if she was from Texas
God Bless Texas
Now they understand 1776
Cornbread goes great with chili
The poor boys, you forgot the honey butter for the cornbread.  Also, that corn bread DID look a little dry.  Did you show them the difference betweeen South West vs South EAST BBQ...  two different worlds.
As a Texan it makes me so happy to see people enjoy good Texas food 🤍😭
If y'all happen to be stateside this Texan would be blessed to be of service and show you the profound deliciousness that is Texas bbq. I'm looking at you Arlington, Austin, Belton, Buda, Houston, Huntsville, Lexington, and Tyler. And that's just the top 20. And while we're at it we'll stop by Chick-fil-A just to have something different to put better bbq sauce on. The sauce is a different episode.
This is so wholesome, hearing people from the countries being so happy to enjoy our food is amazing
8:22 that boy is cooking!
Very articulate young men.
How do they get them bbq though? Did someone from Texas bring their pit all the way to England??? JOLLY EXPLAIN
Lmao the graduation music at 6:09
I'm convinced the principal (head master) hasnt retired just so he can keep getting this food!
I’m sorry, but if you wanna talk about Burnt ends, you better talk about who invented burnt ends. Which is Kansas City you know the king of barbecue, can’t nobody else do it like us. They can try, but they always fail.
Am I the only one who wonders how they get the food to the uk…
Great video. I've always wanted to try authentic bbq. Its not safe to visit the u.s right now with the administration they have. A shame. Especially the threats to my country.
I love this video 😂😂😂🇨🇦
I'm watching this for the brits, not the Americans.
You would think they would be douchey from their haircuts, but they’re cooler than shitty American teens.
Grade 7 is high school WHAT
Bit different from eating baked beans with tuna every day.
Hi from Alabama   I need to try Texas brisket, my dad says I've tried it but I don't believe it because based on the reactions in this video I have not had the Texas brisket
The fact that they're enamored by BBQ and i have it most weekends in the summer
Love from Texas!! I’m so glad they enjoyed most of it!
I also dont like cornbread. But so many people love it
They all gonna be sleeping afterwards 😂😂😂😂. And thats not real cornbread 😂😂😂
American here!: I 100% agree that we should stop making corn bread it’s very gross
Cornbread. I can tell the one served may not be good. My wife makes a killer cornbread. If made right, it is spectacular!
“I’m still, like comprehending the flavors.”
After seeing this video, I can confirm that I'm full.
Making my brisket tonight for 4th of July! Texas love here🤠
They were missing honey for the corn bread. That makes it so much better.
Where did they get these BBQ??? did one of them cook it??   Cuz if so bravo  And I love how these boys are mac and cheese purists. Mac and cheese needs nothing else. Besides the noodles and the cheese, no crunchy
Tell that boy to mop up the grease with the cornbread!!!
They ain’t make lil bra cornbread right
Here we see some of the MORE POLITE London schoolchildren 🙂
I’m guessing they didn’t cook all of this properly. How can they not like cornbread?
These poor kids never had this before
Ohh no... I feel bad for those british subjects, they will never hit this same highs, that's the reason that people get into hard drugs and overdose... Trying to reach the same highs of Texas BBQ. 😢
God bless Texas y’all
0:12 No you don't want that, and that's saying something considering the fact they live in the U.K.
THE CHILDREN YEARN FOR FLAVOR
Jolly good
they finally discover spices
So they never ate ribs before then what in the world do the Brit’s eat?
I’m from the north and let me tell you nobody does barbecue better than the south, the flavors, the texture, it’s all so beautiful
😮
Great, now show them all on the toilet with the changing shots and everything. Show the food on the way out too!
🐮🤠 LONGHORN STATE BABY 🗣🗣
Middle age Texas here, personally I loathe corn bread. But you forgot that every TEXAS BBQ has to have dessert! Cobblers and banana pudding! And where was the potato salad? ( I prefer baked potato salad but mustard is the most common.) then finish it off with iced down watermelon (hard for the adults! IYKYK!).
You gave them cornbread without corn in it?!
Left all of the “I see now why Americans are so fat” jokes on the editing room floor, huh?😅
Texas BBQ sucks. Get you some real southern BBQ. Texas is the mid west not the the South
The only thing missing from this video would be to tell them what it costs to have each item. A beef Rib around me runs about $28.00 each, US. Pork Ribs, about $34.00 for a full rack.
I think if they gave the cornbread a drizzle of honey they’d like it more
Watching these savages try good barbecue brings a tear to my eye.
Harry was enjoying this the entire time
I think in general Americans do food right 95% of the time.
Siding with the British, can’t drink southern sweet tea! ‘Course I’m Canadian…
You need the honey for the corn bread.
Am I the only one who thinks the icons in the corners for the foods look ai generated? If it’s not I’m sorry but it kinda looks like it
They should have been using Texas toast.
its a weird thing watching people loose their mind over BBQ as an American   l mean yea its stupid delicious and I love it but do they really not have anything like it?
Beans on brisket
gosh seeing them eat all of this in their quite fancy school uniforms gave me a mild level of anxiety the entire video. I enjoyed it but I didn't want them to get their clothes dirty
Will you guys at some point be trying Canadian food?
And the fact that you are told a lie that bland British beans soaked in ketchup is better than the baked beans is wild. Even a person that did not possess taste buds would never say that bs
We've literally won every time. Your best food is worse than our worst food
the most flavor and spices any of them have ever experienced
I’m from Texas and seeing these fellas enjoying our BBQ is so wonderful 😊
Fresh tomato slices would be perfect for offsetting the fat.
My 6th or 7th time watching. Love their enjoyment
as an american, i also don't like the crispy top on mac n cheese! the baked cheese on top is better trust me
British kids try flavor for the first time
Little Harry is my favorite of these young men.
Texas!! Guns and BBQ!! MURICA!!!!
My question is where did they find such good BBQ in the UK?
Grew up in Alabama, and imo like 5% of cornbread is actually insanely good. I thought I didn't like cornbread my whole life until college when I had it for the first time where it was actually moist, and it had jalapenos and bacon in it and it was soooo freaking good. So for anyone who hasn't had cornbread, just know it's hard to make cornbread right and most cornbread that you can buy is either stale, too dry, or bland, but good cornbread does exist. And honey butter is a MUST.
How did they get meat from TX to the UK? Did they actually ship it and then it was heated up?
Ugh I'm so glad I'm American
This is so unfair to do this to the lads.
Where did you get the bbq
And they wonder why a lot of us are fat 🦅🦅🦅
Videos like this are the only time I’m proud to be American.
The corn bread needs to be warm and covered in butter that will melt
Glad those boys got to try the good stuff, brings joy to a Texan to see someone enjoying some good BBQ
That looks very good. However, the cornbread, I don’t think you made it correctly. It should never be bland nor dry.
Harry in Year 7 has the best reactions to eating everything. He'z every 2 year old trying something they love for the first time IN JUST HIS EYE REACTIONS ALONE /That or a stoner🤣😂😅🤣😂
Texas my ass that's soul food 😂
Are these British highschoolers in the USA or do you import the food or prepare the food for them?
He's right about stop making cornbread
Come on y’all, you did us Americans dirty by serving them that dry ass Mac and cheese. 😂😂 who’s the cook lemme talk to em!!!!
I love little Harry. Everything he ate, besides the beans, was "lovely" 🤣😭😭🥹🫶🏻🩷
Dave is my favorite headmaster.  So funny watching him nearly pass out while eating.  HAHA
Only thing they’re missing with that bbq is some buttered toasted french bread instead of that plain white bread. I also have a feeling they didn’t do justice to that cornbread
You reeeeeaaaaallly need to bring the headmaster with you on your next trip across the pond.
The children crave flavor
It may be more Mexican than Texas, some frijoles a la charra would have been a great side
I’ve been eating this my whole life and I still react like them. It’s literally life changing
Starting with burnt ends was the best move
I'd really like to send them a proper plate of South Texas Parrillada. (Fajita, chicken, sausage, bacon wrapped jalapeños, short ribs and some proper Pico de Gallo. charro beans and Mexican rice, too!
I'm a Texan, and I love that they've gotten to experience Texas BBQ!  ❤
We forget how good we got it as Americans
The brits always ate with forks and knife, Since they never tasted real flavourful food, untill this day😂
A Brit claiming cornbread is bland is wild! They don’t even know what salt is.
0:47 like to low taper fade 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
THIS IS WHY SO MANY AMERICANS ARE OBESE,  WE LOVE TO EAT GOOD FOOD .
That Harry kid has the same name as me 😂😂
you should do a sea food boil but the propper saucy one
Harry is my favorite.  His facial expressions are hilariously adorable 🥰.
You’ll didn’t make the cornbread right. It’s supposed to be sweet…they said it was bland, so there was clearly no sweetener added to it lol.
That's the taste of freedom boys 💪
Dawg that is not southern sweet tea smh shldve js gotten some Milo’s
aussie here....them treating these brits with such amazing sounding foods is givingme such jealousyyyyy, and the way they use such words like sublime, lolll
Should’ve made the sausage conecuh
Nah the sweet cornbread is a full on sin istg (as a southerner)
It seems like British people have forgotten why they once ruled the world for spices. This is the epitome of the spice trade and it has been lost to the UK since 1776
How does it look so fresh?
I agree.  Corn bread sucks.
Love the fact that they wear suits to school.  Like little gentlemen!
Just wait until they find out about old school cars and muscle cars ... This is why we're big asf yall
Good food takes you places man🥹
I like how proper they complement the bbq. It’s fabulous. lol  -A proud Texan
Mack is NOT 9😭✌️
Did he say never make cornbread 😭
Louisiana Creole, Cajun and soul food would blow their mind😜😋😁
"Do not make cornbread ever again" hope you get an F for that one.  though that cornbread looked dodgy
I think you should take this next group to the US South instead of Korea next time. You should go to Texas, Nashville and Louisiana, then hit Disney World Universal Studios on the way back.😊❤
As someone born in Texas you do not put cole slaw on a BBQ sandwich, onions. pickles and hot sauce. that cornbread looks bad too.
Being black and watching all those little black children say they weren't a fan of the beans nor the mac and cheese im so disappointed 😢 ugh I thought every black child and culture had flavor.. but it doesn't seem so
The 7th graders are so expressive. They were really enjoying themselves.
I'm a bit confused about Mackie. Is he 19 or 9? he looks older than most 20 year olds I've seen
When is there an episode of these kids hitting the street of America to try food? Honest ratings. 😊❤
0:11 I’m sorry but the way it looks now I don’t think your ever gonna move to America
As a Texan, biggest smile on my face watching this. Yall did a great job whoever cooked that plate.
Cornbread is kind of dry and bland. They really should have had it with butter and honey.
In defense of cornbread,  you must butter it heavily, put it in a bowl,  and smother it with chili! NUMMY!
Them eating BBQ in a suit is giving me anxiety
They failed by not getting them the smoked turkey 😂😂  only thing missing with that BBQ platter, and ohhh potato salad and southern greenbeans 😮‍💨 they didnt get the full experience.
It’s so weird because these foods are such a normal part of life and to see them completely enamored by it is hilarious😂😂
So funny how we herein Austin take great smoked meat for granted. Glad you gave them the burnt ends!
They did not get the correct corn bread then.
See this is why we (Americans) are fat.. the food is stupid good
They needed some chili and butter with that cornbread
YOU NEED TO BRING THEM TO TEXAS!!! like what you did with the other group of boys in korea. bbq, cowboys, rodeos, all that!!!
As a Texan who lives in Dallas, it is so wonderful to see out of country people try our foods we have to offer. It's very special indeed. Might try the food they have there one day.
I'm not gonna say which one but they look like that one kid off meet the robinsons
As a southerner, I’m doing my very best to understand why bbq (like friend chicken) isn’t everywhere like it is here; I mean many states have a political system of how they do their bbq. We/many states, literally grew up on it for any and all occasions, and it’s really quite common in its own celebrated way. I’m happy to hear the enthusiasm though in their voices, but what surprises me the most is, that none of them seem truly comfortable touching/holding the food/meat and eating it. Lol. To me, that is way more odd than anything; and how they’re describing things like (the skin on the sausages is really tough to bite through)-mind blowing. Like is there anything in the U.K like bbq where they eat meat with their hands or something? My goodness… look at their hands; wow. Also… they hate cornbread. Bro… what!? Lol.   In my mind, I always thought bbq was a prehistoric thing that came to us from the way Mid-Evil/Vikings or eras like that ate, never just an “America” thing.  By the way, I’m not judging any of them… I just find it all very interesting in the reversal kind of way.
Just love how they hoeing in with their hands. Love their smiles and excitement when the food was presented.
Love this. Bbq is absolutely my favorite dish in the world. It reminds me of home.
Can you do crawfish boil next
Head master stays eating good
with the corn bread they should of had it with honey and butter .  and they should  of also had the beef ribs with BBQ sauce too.
Harry’s “lovely” is so adorable omg
spread butter over the cornbread.
Did the black kids asked to be seated together, or is there some other reason for the segregation?
These kids are so cute I can watch them critique food All day especially that little curly haired kid
Someone bring the headmaster and Mack to the South😭
Take these kids on a southern american roadtrip
That one kid is ready to move. LOL
The “Is he lying? Mmmm … NO he’s NOT lying”. 🤭🤭🥰🥰🥰🥰
I had the best brisket of my life in Beorne, TX
Brits happy over the American revolution now lmao
8:08 the kid on the right gets it, he really gets it.
Curious, do you guys use sweet or non sweet corn bread?  I prefer the sweet stuff my self.
Did you make the cornbread juicy and corny or just bread with a light light hint of corn?
They’re understanding why we’re stereotypically fat
What are you doing to these poor kids!  They’re never gonna eat again! At least bland British food. /s
6:27 as a texan, oh my lord i am jealous.
as a BBQ Pit master in the SOUTH never insult the corn bread the south loves its corn bread its the universal dinner bread like dinner rolls.   Also the mac never insult the mac or the beans unless of course its actually shite idk how them pit beans tasted they looked okay and the corn bread looked a lil dry but its pretty normal too.   Personally I go for a more sweet corn bread and corn cakes with fried corn nuggets on the menu as well.
The cornbread must’ve 100% been cooked wrong, not sweet enough!!
13:40 Poor baby needs somebody to make him some real cornbread 🥲 he broke my heart 💔
As I sit here in Texas and watch this at 10:30 pm, I have a brisket on the smoker for tomorrow. It warms my heart to see these guys enjoying this.  PS I love corn bread, but now with BBQ.
Cornbread tastes better with honey and/or sweet butter.
You know they slept good that night😂
Ugh so excited for Fourth of July can’t wait for that BBQ and I’m in Texas so it don’t get any better than that.
You need to serve them southern lacie cornbread
There is NO such thing as Texas fold
I want to know what recipe for cornbread. Because bland is not a description of the cornbread I know.
To be fair to the youngster who didn't like the cornbread. Cornbread can be hit or miss sometimes. I grew up on it, I love it, and I've also tasted some that resembled sawdust it was so dry.  Plus, to someone who has never had it, it probably was a strange food to them.
Love my Brits..Born in Wimbledon myself
Ima be real I didn't care for baked beans when I was younger but it's grown on me
You guys just need to open a restaurant that specializes in American style food.
YOU failed, the corn bread is supposed to be served with HONEY!!!
As someone from Texas, I never gotten the hype for barbecue but it might be just because there’s so much other great food here lol
Cornbread is only one part of a two part food without butter. It doesn’t make the grade hot cornbread with melted butter on it now that is how you want to introduce cornbread.
I love how every video they hate it before hand then when they try it they completely change their minds
Yeah, I wouldn’t eat any Mac and cheese that’s “runny”. Big red flag there
Gotta go with jalapeño cornbread
i love this series
"You want it to be more bland" 😂😂😂
I love that principle… idk what it is but he’s just funny
I think it’s hilarious how they put the beans on their bread
Ever texen cried tears of happiness watching this😂
11:39 "fucking brits"
Of course they are gonna love it they like beans on toast lol 😂
The expressions of the younger boy with curly hair were so great!!🤣🤣
mack yrs 9 looks like Brad Pitt short hair era
brits don’t eat pickles?
as an american in the south, i don’t like cornbread either
6:27 why is pomp and circumstance playing😭
Cornbread needs butter.
This makes me so proud go be an american. Sharing our culture and other people loving it
Brisket was a family gathering staple growing up in Texas. Good job in finding real Texas style bbq. It’s actually rare to see on these shows. Real slow cooked, meat candy.
@jolly, how did you bring the BBQ? did you smoke them yourself?
This is like giving an animal some kind of food and then they continuously look for said food just to never find it 😂
Love this...❤❤ the kids weee blessed I wonder if their parents had any and how they like it
I hate cornbread unless it's "sweet cornbread".  Texas native...
Giving corn bread without butter and honey is just wrong
The kiddo with the curly hair is hilarious with the faces he makes! Adorable kiddos! All of them!
My favorite episode!
that kid has a really sophisticated pallet, nice work lad
They all realize they should have been born in Texas
It helps to add a bit of sugar to the cornbread mix, & while still hot, slather with honey butter.✨️
2:53 I love this part
Just had bbq for lunch today 😂 easily the best American food that’s ever existed
I’ll be having cornbread tonight in ya’lls honor, thankyouverymuch. And I’m in Southern California. We’re not really known for our BBQ here, but we do have an excellent place just down the road.
Can I have va piece?  I'm salivating
Headmaster ain’t got time to be feeling patriotic. Man said this is the beans I need
The headmaster was having a religious experience. 😂😂
I've been seeing tiktoks and some of the shorts for a few days now.  I'm so glad I stopped to see the entire video.  That's so good to see these kids try some of our BBQ favorites.  I love it!!
10:36 😂😂😂
If those boys want to come to America, they can apply to colleges here. This will give them a chance to spend four years here and look for a girl whose family does Texas BBQ😅
I’m from Kansas City and would argue that our BBQ is in a league of its own and Texas can eat our dust but….hell yeah! Respect where it’s due, that BBQ looks amazing! Also, not a huge fan of cornbread either…
"That's not tea, that's so sweet" - Ethan    Me: It shouldn't be called iced *tea* then. "Everything is better with bread in it" - Mr Smith    Me: Absolutely, yes, everything is better with bread in it.
The top comment should be where you sourced this from in the UK?
Love these Pommy kids ❤
A long time watcher, these boys are so polite and sweet, they all speak what they feel and I love it, keep p the awesome channel
I usually dont watch the ad reads but you guys did this one MASTERFULLY. And as someone who lives on the US border to Canada, I actually could use it 😂😂😂 good job lads!
4:10 he put the perfect amount 🤣
These poor kids had to go home after this and eat their bland boiled food.
Use the cornbread to sip up the juices of your plate boys!
After eating that, these kids get to partake in a great American bbq pass time: an itis nap
I love these videos. But, I don't understand. Are these kids in a school in the US? I'm confused...😅
i like honey on my cornbread. but everything looks good
We’ll take you kiddo 🫡
To be fair, cornbread can be pretty hit or miss.  Everyone has a different cornbread recipe, and they all have different flavors and textures.  My favorite type of cornbread is sweet and moist, some people prefer a savory kinda cornbread.  End of the day though, cornbread is kind of a low quality poor man's bread, and I usually prefer normal bread or mixing it into chili or beans.
I was hoping you’d include some girls this time. It would be great to feel included! Food looks good tho🙂👍 nice vid
That brisket is gorgeous. The right brisket can truly cause multiple orgasms.
As an American it makes me so happy to see other countries enjoy our food. I love this channel, they always speak to highly of our food and well... that is why so many American are fat. lmaooo but it's all about moderation and exercise. You can enjoy good food as long as you do it the healthy and moderate way. 😊
The world knows why we’re fat now 😂
Best reaction was the headmaster. It seems he will be heading for a Texas holiday pretty soon
As a Mexican Texas I eat this almost everyday, that all my father eats just cook out bbq ribs  These kids finna raise the prices on BBQ from England
Me sitting here waiting for the meat-sweats to kick in.
Oh I hate coleslaw.
they gave them some mid ass cornbread
Cornbread is best with butter and honey
Barbecue like that puts you RIGHT to sleep I wonder if any of these kids made it through the day
I like how the pictures look like thay were ai generated or drawed
Everyone who hates cornbread 👇
12:53 We won last time too. 1776 🇺🇸 😂 This was a joy to watch. - Florida
Cornbread is too dry, shouldn't be crumbling.
I grew up just outside of Houston and I will say that dry cornbread is better if you grew up on it. For first time cornbread eaters I recommend a moist recipe. Though some people can be almost religious with their cornbread, so not sure if others would agree lol! This was hilarious to watch! Everything looked great!
I want to be Josh's friend. Also so those kids who never had ribs...I guess no Tony Romas or TGIF in England...Also up next Korean LA GalBi
I suspect you didn't use enough corn meal, butter milk and salt for the corn bread.
Seafood boil next?? 😋😋
Harry and kavan need to go eat BBQ in the us now. Their lives have been changed 😭😭
The boy Mack looks like brad pitt in his younger years
I think they i understand why obesity rates are so high. With food like this??
“Americans are so fat they eat so much!” Now you get it huh
Hwat do they eat in greta britain cause they act like it’s the most mind blowing food✌️😭
you can just see that principal never tasted REAL flavor before lmao
And now they have some idea why most of USA is obese.  Nothing like brisket.
"Lovely" is such a sweet way to describe Texas barbecue. This was darling.
You can't make cornbread?
Love watching them try the foods. I like how the headmaster knows he loves it cuz his taste buds are mature and the boys prob not refined their palettes as yet 😅but they are very entertaining ❤
13:41 kid better watch his back. Every southerner is gonna be after him now after that statement 😂. Cornbread isnt meant to be eaten by itself really. Its gonna sit in some kinda juice to sponge up the flavor. Its called cornbread, but its mostly a corn sponge cake.
That little boy that looks like baby bowler hat guy makes me laugh when his eyes get big lol
Too bad it’s not Carolina barbecue. Texas barbecue is great but it’s not quite the crescendo. Lol
the 630 people that disliked the video 💀
This is why I don’t get picky eaters
This settles it Texan BBQ would kill a Victorian child
King Arthur pulled the sword from the stone. Pit Master Arthur does the same with beef ribs. Both are legends of great renown
9:08 headmaster wondering how hard it would be to find a new life in the U.S.
Steak but smokey. Perfect!
You're supposed to put honey butter on the cornbread so it's not so dry
Merica
Just missing the pulled pork but good vid. - From a Texan
Nandos will never be this cheeky.
British people: see beans, instinctively slather them on bread.
Honest question, do they ship the food (then reheat it) back to UK? Or do they make it there? Or how does this work?
Only a teenaged boy could eat like this and not throw up afterwards.
petition to bring back ollie’s mullet
pomp and circumstance
I’m really disappointed in them for giving these poor kids some dry cornbread.
You can't say you're giving them Texas barbecue, and then start with burnt ends.  That's Kansas City barbecue!
I’m really disappointed in them for giving these poor kids some dry cornbread.
I agree headmaster, everything is better with bread 😋
They shouldve gotten a black person to make the cornbread
When other counties try all the different food we have here, i feel like they start to understand why we are so fat 😂😂😂😂
1:55 absolutely sublime 😭😭😭
Honestly that cornbread did look a bit dry so we need a redo lol
"please don't ever make my corn bread ever again" was the most real opinion ever 😂
Literally perfection from Texas we pride ourselves on our BBQ
What about nachos?
Steak x1000 is crazy😂
Jolly, you should know better than any other Brits that burnt ends are a Kansas City specialty, not Texas. That made me sad.
Now take it somewhere other than a private school
This has shown me as a Austin Texas girl when I visit there I mostly likely won’t enjoy the food
I feel like cornbread deserves another chance.  Cast iron cornbread is fantastic!
In the USA growing up.  Looked forward to Monthly Pizza Fridays because we bring our lunches to school.  Wonder if in the UK schools have BBQ days.
아이들 신났네.맛있어보입니다.
where is the butter and honey for the cornbread????
that one guy looks like brad pitt
i noticed they all stick their fingers inside their mouths along with the food when they eat. pretty gross
The look of disappointment on Olly's face when the one kid didn't like the crusty bits in the mac and cheese
Sang us a bit
Your the funny one 😂😂😂
Watching these kids eat our everyday food is really great, welcome to the ROT boys!
"Everything is better with bread in it" might be the most British thing I've ever heard.
They all gone have the itis 😂😂
You have to have your cornbread warm with lovely butter and honey.Just on its own it's too gritty and dry.  This is great,watching the boys and their headmaster really enjoy these new tastes and textures.Making me hungry!
To be fair Cornbread is different depends on who makes it.  I like mine with butter, it has to be added when its right out the oven.
It’s like a religious awakening!
The headmaster is now considering changing vacation location from Portugal to Texas
We have the best food period because it's seasoned and infused with different cultures ❤❤❤❤
They're probably regretting that their ancestors taxed the Americans too much.
Bruh these cats wasn't ready im salivatin so u know they r im cryin lol stay safe RIP Dave Parker Brian Wilson pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze
If you could introduce them to one more American dish after Texas BBQ, what would it be? Mac and cheese? Deep-dish pizza?
Little melted butter or honey on the cornbread is next level
they just got hit with Star spangled FREEDOM 🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
10:37 -- "I don't think I can eat food here anymore...!" 😅 He loves it so much 😇🩷
Texas bbq is the one think america does best. Literally anybody can like it
Ca a l air tellement bon. Merci les gars pour le doublage. La voix c est pas encore ca mais on apprécie 😘
The teach was the only one eating it correctly😭🤣
They never saw the major case of the meat sweats coming their way until it hit them!!  😅
Im sure everyone was in a food coma after this! 😂
Now you need to try Kansas City BBQ. Where BBQ was BORN. Kansas City Blues, Booze, and BBQ!
Those kids had a spiritual experience and awakening
I raise cattle so you may enjoy this feast and I am so proud
As an American, that kid that said no more cornbread, is based! I don’t like it either bro! Just give me a regular bread roll! Also, never even heard of pit beans! Idk where I would even get them!
“ oh my days “ 😂😂😂
“ sublime “ ikdr
8:46 🤨🤨🤨
12:28 I seriously gotta find out what yall British like about baked beans
As an American I had an ear to ear grin this whole video. Glad they enjoyed it
How many times did the headmaster go uggghgg? I counted. It was 10 . Good snacks ,huh?
And now they know why half of America is overweight. Our food is just really good.
Why do they never have high school girls try things on here?
*Butter and eat cornbread when its freshly cooked*
*PROUD TEXAN WATCHING THIS* 🖤
Im a fan of this channel and this interview on school boys honest opinion on different food....but please to something new. Why only boys? Are there no school for girls that can you atleast try interviewing. Just to change the environment and opinion that you will get
“COME AND TAKE ARE BBQ”🤠
I’m still comprehending the flavors lol
My dad was so dedicated to brisket that he spent 6 mounths reaserching how to make it the best, and when he made what we now call the nick special ( his brisket, pork belly burntends, and mased potatoes) our friends can smell it and know that it means its time have a " random get-together ". So when he heard what these kids started to say about brisket he started to get MAD like red in the face MAD
Totally adorable these series is one of the best on youtube.
Imagine if these boys would’ve been flown to Texas and a southern grandma was tasked with making bbq for them, she probably goes above and beyond and they these boys get to eat the best bbq
A cast iron skillet cornbread is better then what they provided
I love cornbread oh and fried okra and fried pickles and brisket!!! This is making me soooo hungry 🤤
half of my family literally founded Middlesboro Kentucky and one of them was a Major in the Revolutionary war. I'm as American as it gets and southern, needless to say the Cornbread slander had me ready to run the war back on your soil this time lol!  Jokes aside, glad they got to experience some good BBQ!
"Never make Cornbread Again..."   I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  Thank you!  Send Love from Columbus, Georgia!
I’m watching this getting ready for bed and now I’m hungry 😂
I like how they immediately put the beans on bread. That's such a British thing and not how those beans are eaten.
i’m an American and i ain’t even had a brisket😂😪
Many Americans do not play when it comes to cooking delectable food. That steak looks like the greatest. Those Texans are experts with that beef.
How did you mess cornbread up???
That is not burnt ends…..
You need to bring the principal to America 😂
Yo the JUICY and TENDER meat looks DELICIOUS
The uk could really use a couple of american expats opening some bbq restaurants.
No the corn bread comment tbh I also don’t like corn bread lol, it’s too dry and I know it’s supposed to be dry but no yea corn bread Nuh uh lol, and I live in Texas too lol
How is the food prepared? is it like flown in? or does someone make it there? Just curious
A fun bit of weird history from my childhood: In the town I grew up in there was a successful mall that had a food court with two Chinese restaurants in it. The restaurants engaged in a pricing war undercutting one another until finally one couldn't maintain margins and had to concede. Rather than closing down, they rebranded to the Texas Barbecue Factory and changed absolutely nothing about their menu. The food was garbage but the story was too absurd to ignore.  They managed to survive somehow, about 10 or 15 years until the mall was renovated and they were lost to time.
And they lived happily ever after 😂
Im from Houston TX born and raised and it was such a delight watching these young gentlemen enjoy our culture thank you for the video this was awesome
the most anti-vegan video
I love how they eat it like theyve been living off mre's their whole life
I would have an upset stomach after all that meat and fat
Texan here, Cornbread is very divisive here too. Lol! Thankfully there are different types, jalapeno cornbread, corn muffins (sweet cornbread) and hush puppies (which is usually served with seafood)
Women are not allowed in schools in England?
No love for the links at all
As an American - forget Hollywood, Jordans, Iphones, Hip Hop, Stand up comedy, etc - Texas BBQ is our greatest achievement...
I love how you chose YOUNG MEN as well. Absolutely. ❤
Being from Texas is brings me joy to see our food be described so good
First time britsh people actually had good food
That's not BBQ Mac and cheese that's a casserole you just game them
As a American I can confirm this stuff is fire and we also have baked means
Please have them try soul food for the next video! And make sure you get it from a black cook lol
Cornbread in the south is usually pretty darn good. Depending on where you get it, cornbread can be dry. What was provided here did look dry. It should not be as crumbley. I encourage the lads to try it again.
you guys must not have made very good cornbread.
And we have guns i love being  a American 😂
I've never had good cornbread in texas. Its always dry and bland. Yes they cook meat to near perfection but lack in performance regarding side items and breads.
이제 한국어 자막은 안올려주시나요?
For cornbread I like mines super sweat with a syrup drizzle on top like cake😂 and yes it’s juice tea, if it ain’t sweet then you ain’t put enough sugar in it. It’s just dirty water😂 the beans… im not a big fan of beans but bbq beans is alright
You should try in N out
Give em a seafood boil
Good Ol Merica
Behold, the wonders of america
I've always been grateful for growing up in Texas, for our food most is all. I had an exchange student from Belgium and she took home a whole book of my recipes 😂 Food really is our love language in the South 🥰
I so enjoy seeing these boys enjoying our delicious foods. I lived in the UK for awhile and literally said, “beautiful country, lousy food”, with the exception of fish and chips and a proper English breakfast. But watching these fellas gives me a renewed appreciation of our superb American food - and I need some brisket - STAT!
Wait…. Mr. Smith became the headmaster?! 😭 😭 that’s so awesome for him!
No pickles in the UK?
Shoulda been some peppers and onions in that cornbread ohhhh Lordy or at the very least just some sweet cornbread to impress them kids 😂
"I don't even think I can eat food here any more!" 🤣🤣🤣  Welcome to Texas, sir! ❤️
This gives off the same vibes as introducing a victorian era child to neurolink brain rot
I require BBQ, right now!!  Fortunately.... I'm in Texas! 🙌❤️
Meat is just manly, every man loves some good meat on his plate.
As an old Canadian man watching those Britt school boys I just think it’s an absolute pleasure to watch their language is so different very civilized lol
Even vegans like Texas BBQ but won’t ever admit it
They all sound like little gentleman, and then they start eating and you realize “they are baby dinosaurs”
whoever did the music?? it's so funny ! great job on music
Dudes need to eat sweet cornbread
As a proud born and raised El Pasoan. Who'll always say we Texans have the best BBQ. I am so glad y'all enjoyed and indulged yourselves in our greatest cuisine.
This is why Americans are fat😂 that good southern food full of fats and greasy deliciousness
You gotta put butter on that corn bread
"you're the funny one!" got me cracking
It is so funny they went straight to putting the beans on the bread...like Beans and Toast bruv.
Looking at those pickles and that cornbread...I can tell you that it was not good. My cornbread recipe is a little sweeter with honey and more like a cake. I am not a fan of thin pickles or crumbly bland cornbread. Gimme that honeyed kind cooked in a cast iron skillet baby! Texas BBQ is top tier American food.
Absolutely love you guys
As s NC southerner, I enjoyed watching these kids try something new. Cornbread is a staple in this house.
You gotta put Jalepenos in your cornbread. And cover in honey butter.
As a Texan I almost declared war for cornbread
The high schoolers should really try Freddy’s steak burger it’s so delicious
Why America is fat.
😂🇬🇧🇺🇲❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉
The irony is that the food in the US tastes better, but you won't live a longer life ...
The way they got so excited over getting pickles
When food is so good, it makes you mad. 😅😅😅
Finally America for the win! 🎉 🇺🇸 🎉 😂   But wait… are pickled cucumbers not commons in the UK. You’ve got pickled eggs, pickled cabbage, pickled onion, but not pickles 🥒?   Did I misunderstand?
Pickle milkshake. Sounds like a craving of fast growing boys.
Should have had the cornbread with the beans.
I have always been curious how you all source the food? How do you maintain the quality and the consistency with the actual places' food?
So intelligent compared with American students of same age whose only grammar is yk like um really
"they try to sneak beef into everything" as an American there isn't a more true statement😂
he said "yeah uh... PLEASE never make cornbread EVER again" HAHAHAHA that's the one that sent me 🤣🤣🤣
IS THAT DAVID
"Its absolutely sublime" these kids are so educated and well spoken
I love all these kids! They're all so self possessed, polite, engaging, and bright! That school is doing a good job of helping raise young men. Enjoy your taste of the USA, but remember.. we also have an obesity problem over here. lol
Harry clearly should have been born in Houston. Rough draw, buddy
I love when they try things they enjoy. 😂😂😂
Cornbread is better toated with butter
Bring the headmaster to America for a food tour petition right here!
If you come to America. You have to go to Franklin's BarBecue in Austin Texas.😋 (Only after the orange dictator is out of office)😶‍🌫️
I down voted it purely for the cornbread comment at the end😂😂
As an American who loves BBQ, lol this is the reason Americans are big fatties😂😂😂. But t you can't eat it everyday your heart will explode before you your reach 50 years old
MACK IS NOT IN YR9 THERESNO WAY HALF THESE GUYS LOOK OLDER but this was a funny video 😂🙌
You have to put a bunch of butter on the cornbread
I'm from Memphis and i completely agree about never making cornbread again. I hate it.  Give me dinner rolls.
Them immediately putting it on bread
Guy on the right who doesnt like pickles, give him a ticket here immediately, the only one to eat bbq the American way, messy af, head down, not a word said, tried the pickles while hating em, loved it, send him here immediately
Hope these boys get to come to America some day and do a food tour of the whole south.
you need to some butter and honey to the cornbead
"Oh i love beans" 😂 that was so stinking cute
“Oh i love beans” had me laughing so hard 12:39
That cornbread looked really dry did you put butter on it.  Ribs are so good, brisket is  3ven better?❤❤😂😂
What my burning question is: where in London did you source this food? Because I want some...I am willing to do some things...to get it.
The boy who ate One Bean was clearly raised to be respectful of foods he has no interest in eating 😂
Is this reverse colonization?
Lmao why are you saluting Spain they literally pushed out all the Muslims hundreds of years ago Ahhaa 😂
Why does it make us so happy to see people from other countries fall in love with our food? Ill never understand but I'm definitely here for it.
To be fair that corn bread looked pretty dry lol
The way they open their mouth to say something cool or badass  and all come out is ‘lovely’❤😂😂😂
Love this content  😂 looks like this was a life changing epiphany for them
"I don't think I can eat anything else after this" they gave the lads fairy food 😭
My dad when he makes cornbread, he’ll do half Jif cornbread and half Betty Crocker yellow cake. It is divine.🤤
British people taste spices for the first time
They need to make video with harry
I want a brisket so bad now. My mouth was watering watching them. 😂
Yorkshire pudding would be a big hit in the states at a BBQ.
While we have a lot of localized "American" dishes, I'd have to say  - on an international level - Southern barbeque and its fixins are probably "the" national cuisine of America.  While we have cheesesteaks, New York pizza, tex-mex, lobster rolls, etc. etc. etc...I think Souther barbeque and its associated comfort foods are really the most identifiable, sought-after foodstuffs here.
as an american, i’ve never wanted a brisket at 8am more than i do right now
How would they not use every part of the animal havining been through 1000's of yrs of history. Did the war really reduce them to beans on toast.
Eat the bread with the meat, use it as a sponge to soak up the fat and the juice. Together ❤
I need to go get 250 bucks of bbq now. Thanks.
Have you not eaten in a week broke me😂😂😂😂
The cornbread made with sugar is much better than the usual southern cornbread!
Wheres the OG boys
As a Brit a support this
I think that kid is having a seasoning stroke 😊😊
Little harry was about to ascend😂😂😂 he looked 'lovely' while enjoying the food. Cute kid❤
This is why americans are fat. Cause we eat stuff like this all the time
Harry looks and sounds so much like Goob from the Robinsons, love his reactions😂
worried at this point for mr smith's cholesterol levels.... 😅😅
Put that cornbread in some milk! Or have it hot with some butter smeared on it.
Please give these guys a Louisiana seafood boil they will love it and I can promise that on everything
THEY PUT THE BAKED BEANS ON THEIR TOOOAAASSTTFG WHHHYYYYYY
Dear British people:  1) get your cornbread from a black person it'll change your life, preferably someones grandma   2) Use Texas Toast for your bbq beans & toast, but again here & with most side dishes you're gonna want to try a black person's side dishes for the best 1st experience
Coen bread needs to have butter and a drizzle of honey on it
Tiny British Sam Riegel wants to come to the states! ❤ I hope you get to someday and enjoy all the culinary oddities we have to offer.
Ive never eaten cornbread with BBQ.  Pintos n cornbread is a staple.  Its more with fried chicken, beans or greens and cornbread.  It usually goes with something like soup chili.  You crumble it with a wet food.
American food is not the best for your health. It's just the best tasting in the world 😅
I demand a rematch for the cornbread. Try different recipes and see which ones work best.
They’re so flavor deprived it’s sad lolol😂
As I Texan I approve
That cornbread does look a little dry.
British Respect leveled up! LV 1 > LV 2
These kids had a taste bud spiritual awakening
7:38 wait- are they twins???
These kids are so cute, the way they describe food is so honest
I picked the wrong time of day to watch this, it’s 3am
That was a bad cornbread, I don’t blame that kid haha
Do Texas BBQ for other countries high schoolers
Just Wait til they TRY SOUL FOOD by Black Americans.😅
And THAT my friends, is why we’re so FAT 😂
They need to abbreviate the definition for purity and include these kids reactions as an example
Should be re-titled: British kids try food with flavor for the first time!
0:45 *sigh* im so sorry for saying what im about to say..... It's the... Low, taper.... fade. 😕
I love every time the headmaster loves something yall give him, he looks like he’s debating on changing the menus in his school
Curly haired boy is so sweet and positive, I want to adopt him. ❤
Speaking as a Texan myself, I don't like cornbread either.
You need to have melted honey butter on the corn bread.
Yall need to redo the corn bread section it didn’t get to its full potential, yall forgot to have a jar of honey to put on the cornbread
There's nothing more American than what comes after... meat sweats followed by a food coma. That's when you know you've done it right ✅️
Harry is ready to move to Texas 😂😂😂😂😂
Wait till they try a Texas Twinkie 🤤🔥
😊
Not everybody makes corn bread the same. some people make it kind of dry mind's moist and delicious.
7:30 Yeah as a person from Houston cornbread its very dry not really the best and 13:06 sweet tea is nasty its gross I would rather open a can of Arizona tea or get a boba tea and not a lot of people drink ice tea in Texas 😂
🥔
Alternative title, "British High-school students suddenly understand why obesity is so high in the U.S".
TEXAS UNCLE here... all that meat except the brisket was dry. It's so crazy to see people enjoying food we eat every day. It's also good to know... if I every find myself in the UK. I can definitely open a Real Texas BBQ joint and see a profit.
why do they have such interesting vocabulary
Thank you for letting them taste flavor 🙏
For the corn bread they should have used jiffy mix
Tbh with cornbread it’s better to cook it with honey and put salted butter on it and it has to be warm it can also have real bits of corn kernels in it it’s good that way or you can add cheese and corn or just by itself I love cornbread lol
Did bro go to smokey mos for that thumbnail
How those kids ate all that is amazing.  As a northerner here i love texas BBQ, but I've traveled allot over the years and I've had great BBQ in Kansas City and in Memphis too
British people experiencing real flavor for the first time is one of my favorite weird YouTube sub genres. 😂
The adult in this… he’s contemplating moving to Texas 😂
Kavan looks like an anime school villain
10:18 i would clip this and show it to my principle everyday
there is some alternate video title about results of the British getting their ass kicked in 1776: we use spices on our food and dont just sell them
I do not envy the meat sweats these boys are going to have in 30 minutes. They honestly will not know what hit them.
They need the real thing that looked like it was old 😅
Somebody didn’t make the cornbread properly
As someone living in Houston Texas I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIIIIIIIIIIIIISSS and totally expected this reaction haha I love it (although I will confess I don’t eat cornbread with my BBQ- instead I top it off with some more BBQ sauce 😂)
Mexican food or Mexican snacks for next video😏😏 or some Carne asada too
That does look good
Seeing British people eat real food for the first time makes me truly happy 🥹
Are the one set of students twin brothers?
10:36 THIS IS WHY AMERICANS TELL YOU BRITISH FOOD IS AWFUL!!! We grew up on this
He had a food orgasm at 2:44 😅
I’ll take one of everything! Except, hold the pickles 😃 🤤
Coleslaw is NECESSARY on a bbq Sammy!
I’m surprised they didn’t like the cornbread! One of my favorite sides
This headmaster needs to do more of these! lol
That Itis is about to kick in soon. They’re done for the day lol!
Cornbread is probably the biggest hit or miss here for me, because a bbq spot can make the best meat ever and make some bland ass cornbread 😂
Is one of the main reasons I wana go to texas just for some BBQ
The lack of butter and honey for the cornbread as a secondary option
Now yall know why so many of us are fat 😂😅
The rare moment where i become extremely proud of my home state
You have to bring them tater tot casserole
If you didn’t give them honey butter with the corn bread, you’ve done them a disservice.
The principle with every bite he takes he sighs. Makes me think like in his head he goes. Damn thats good. Can't believe I have to go back to beans and toast after this.
God this made me want barbecue now. Especially that brisket and those ribs. They look so good 😭😭😭
Grilled meats can bring people of all walks of life together
Cornbread is missing the butter some people make it dry
As a true Texan we don't eat cornbread EVER with bbq
As a korean american from TX, I approve of this. We Americans welcome any UK nationals who love Texas BBQ.
Mr laugh it up over here
British Highschoolers go to America?
So nice to see my people represented and even praised. To all the hard work of ancestral southerners, hispanic, and african survival cooking knowledge
You can just tell harry is the type of kid that gets in zero trouble friends with every probably spends his days cleaning his room
Is that the champions league anthem when the brisket comes out ?
Love the video
13:30 That tea is not dark enough! Thats weak!
“American’s really go big or go home with food”. Damn right homie!
We need a gofundme to bring the headmaster to Texas. Dude would have a great time
I like the young lad who always says “that’s lovely”
The principle is the best one. Dude is like dying and going to heaven with every bite. Thats a man that appreciates some good BBQ
I can't believe headmaster is coming to Portugal! ❤ I'm waiting for your turn Ollie and Josh!! When you're in Portugal or need tips ask away, we have really good food :)
Ah man. Best thing about BBQ are the subtle variations depending on where you are in the south. Texas style, Kansas City, North and South Carolina, and Memphis Style.   That has to be a future video. Trying all the different styles. Which is your favorite?
They’re all darling, but I think Harry is adorable 🩷 he thinks everything is lovely and is so open to trying all the new foods
bring them to the u.s.!! nothing like eating all of these different foods here 😮‍💨
Wait until they try Kansas City Barbecue
And people wonder why Americans are so “fat” lol 😂
Get these boys some purple hull peas, okra, and some oxtail.
i love watching the Headmaster's reactions the best
Can you bring back Korean subtitles, please?? 자막 해주세용…
As Southerner who smokes meat on a regular basis. I don't mind cornbread, but it's not like an amazing food. I'm fine eating brisket, ribs, pulled pork, etc and not having cornbread.
Oh young sirs, cornbread is delicious. Especially fresh from the oven with a pat of butter on it.
I don’t understand how or why everyone has to make all the sound effects 🥴
My wife makes her cornbread with a little sugar and cinnamon in the batter. Absolutely nothing comes close to her recipe.
im so glad I get to watch my favorite show "British people eat food that is fit for human consumption"
That teacher is experiencing heaven, he seems so surprised and happy with almost everything they give him
The skin on the sausage is the best part! Feeling it crack is do fun😅. Thankful to be southern. Going to go get bbq this week just because i can 😂❤
It’s funny how they all instinctively put the beans on the toast 😂
Yall forgot the butter and honey for the cornbread 😩
You eat cornbread with butter on it and honey if you have it
I live in Texas, and this makes me want to go out and get some BBQ.
I’ve wanted to try cornbread since they fought over it in Life with Eddie Murphy 😂 all that southern food looks unreal ❤️🇮🇪❤️
I love brisket! I made brisket when we had some missionaries from Berlin come to our church
Texan here. Had to Google "Mackers" and will now be calling McDonald's that name from here on out. YOU WOT MATE A FACKIN PROPER MACKERS??
Seeing British kids experience peak American food makes me so happy for some reason
Nothing makes me happier than seeing people experience Texas BBQ. I am a Texan, born & bred. In Dallas. We forget how lucky we are to have this absolutely beautiful cuisine at our fingertips 24/7. Watching these guys experience the love that good food brings is pure magic. And please bring the headmaster to America. He is brilliant😂💀😂.
Texan here. Yes, I love brisket too.
I know they went straight to sleep when they got home. 😂
As a Texan wed love to eat this daily if it wasn’t so dang expensive lol it’s a special treat endless you can cook it at home in the smoker!
Had that one kid eyes rolling in the back of his head, little homie was having a religious experience. 🤣
Non Americans enjoying american culture warms my heart
My cornbread actually has flavor and it’s crispy all around the outside.
Put some ham and beans on the cornbread and he might change his mind!
"Cor"  says it all!
This is medicine for my soul, it’s so refreshing seeing non Americans appreciate our food.
I feel like we need to see Dave's Southern Food tour sooner or  later. I can imagine him in tears eating ribs etc
🥹 seeing little boys enjoy their meal  makes me want to cook
these are so adorable to me
5:04 - 5:05 Sponsor intermission 6:06 - 6:07 Sponsor skip
Kids anytime your in America, the South welcomes you to try all of our different foods.  Fried catfish. Crawfish, barbeque, gumbo, jumbalaya etc.
Those kids are SO funny.  I love the looks on their faces.  Such a great idea.  Thanks guys...I'm sure that was a logistical nightmare but you did it!!!!
I wanna eat a lot from this video… and none of ‘em were food.
Why does that one kid look like a young brad pitt
Been in Texas over 30 years and never heard of a Texas fold 😅
High Schooler trip round 2 but this time, ✨Texas✨
I am not a fan of southern cornbread either. I tend to like it sweet.
2:48  'you're the funny one' was even funnier than Ollie, so true
Give them Cajun food next they might pass out
Monty and Freddy look like fraternal twins, They are always together. Or they might just be best friends.
Wait til' they see our daily commutes
im sorry but ribs > brisket
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore" 😂😂😂
I adore all of these kids !!! Their reactions are priceless and they're so well behaved!❤
them getting critical about the tea was great.
Cornbread is best when it's sweet. It balances out the salt-intensive flavor of bbq
Watching the headmaster fully regress  is on its own worth the price of admission.
"I'm along for the ride." - a proper adventurer.
My eyes are watering is awesome he was so happy
The kid in the front at the bottom corner looks a little like it
The headmaster is a legend with sausages
it’s impossible to be a higschooler so Id probably want to be that headmaster right now. 😂
Headmaster is looking FIT and fantastic and at least 10 years younger!  Well done, good sir!
im hungry now
I appreciate the teacher he is so awesome and always enjoys our food! America might be a lot of things but our BBQ is unmatched same with our Fried Chicken.
Tbh the only thing Texas does right in my experience is smoked meat. Anything else is just pretty good.
Sad that their are so many blacks in Britain now they are completely destroying the country and the rest of europe
With cornbread, you gotta slap a big ole chunk of butter on it! Really adds to it
I only have one problem with this video. I'm not there to share in these delicious BBQ'd meats.
Europeans wonder why Americans are fat. Then they try our food.
In all fairness you didn't put any butter or honey on the cornbread... You also wasn't using it to soop up the juices
Harry was just rediscovering life the entire video 😭
So who made the barbecue and where did they make it? I’m super curious. Also, did they use Mesquite wood? It’s not Texas BBQ if it’s not Mesquite I’ll die on that hill. A dumbass parents moved to California recently and they have to finish off their barbecue with Mesquite chips from a bag. My uncle went to Hawaii for vacation and put Mesquite wood in his suitcase for when he barbecued.
เหนื่อยทั้งใจ เหนื่อยทั้งคันรถ
Worst thing you coulda gave them for lunch, because they gonna be knocked out the rest of the day lol
The cornbread slander won’t be tolerated.
Y'all like American food, your Mac n cheese is not ours...😊
Don’t worry guys a lot of Americans also hate cornbread that stuff don’t taste good
Cornbread with honey butter!!!!
I'm seriously interested to learn how you pulled this off. Delivering fall off the bone BBQ to these kids. (And headmaster.)
Yes❤
god that looks amazing
I’ve never heard of a “Texas fold” nor have I ever seen a rib that big  - Texan
Life long Texan, we are loud and proud of our food and the culture we hold here! Thank you for bringing our culture across the pond! We love y’all here 💕
That brisket look so dam good 🤤
You must bury the cornbread with butter!!😊❤
10:36 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Damn the younger ones  understood more the flavor
Them taking their polite smaller bites, versus me eating the whole rib in one bite and taking 20 bites a minute
No breadcrumbs on the mac and cheese please
Im grew up as a poor Midwestern.   Elephant ears and corn on the cob was about as highend as we got.   I didnt eat fresh fish or steak until i was in my 20s  These kids are lucky
1:32  kavav: I can't even describe it...  Harry: perfect.....
Texas BBQ for the win
Merica🫡 pray for us we got a racist dictator in office and he wack with the stuff he’s implementing!!! Merica
As a Texan, it is so cool to see their faces just light up on the first bite!!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤
Meat candy
you really need honey butter on cornbread for it to taste good
Sweet moist corn bread is better than gritty dry corn bread
Not the patriotic music in the background 🏈🗽🦅
Thats a small plate.. get em texas size.
"Thats Luhvleh~" So cute lol
isn't this an upload
This makes me proud to be a southern Texan. `MERICA!!! 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Lol don’t know if it was just that cornbread was bland but some are amazing.
As a southerner  You boys gotts try my Jalepeno Cheddar CornBread  Guaranteed will change your mind on it haha
You're welcome! Love Texas
I hope no one got gout. 😮
The Texas fold is suppose to be white onion, with a little potato salad, and some pickles
Lol british using their fingers dig in
One more time for the Europeans in the back, this is why we are fat
My southern heart was singing watching this god bless these boys I hope they all have lots of sausage and ribs in their futures
I just know they all slept so good that night 🤭🥰 the itis just hits better after a full meal of BBQ.
They were really good sports about it 👍
Please bring the headmaster to Texas, 🙏🏻.  I love the headmaster and the school kid’s reactions to any food.  This episode is the best.
They probably should have taken off those blazers because once those meat sweats hit they'll feel like they're sweating buckets 😂
I wonder...is the food cooked there in the UK
One life equals one poor British child getting to taste flavor for the first time😢
9:11 🤣 That's the face of "I need to stop or I'm going to be in a food stupor.... But I don't want to stop cause it's so good!"  I just love their reactions after saying something doesn't look good. It shows people that pretty food doesn't always mean GOOD food.
The cornbread not hitting if it don't taste like a loaf of cake
The obesity rate in the UK after this video             📈         📈     📈 📈
When the Brits say this quite nice..or this is brilliant or this is lovely or this is exquisite  u kno they mean it😂😂
The teacher was the only one who ate the beans properly and why would you make them bland cornbread? Why wouldn’t you make the honey cornbread?
Why do I remember watching a clip of this a few years ago
How lovely. They would say my food tastes good :)
13:40 Boys...ready the harbor....
Could I have some please 😭
Those are not British kids
It would be honor to eat with them.😂❤🎉
Heck’s no! Do NOT come here for BBQ! It’s not worth it! We will send you recipes
I know jolly actually loved their time in the South cause most British channels showing southern BBQ would think the "prize item" or "the star of the show" would be ribs because of tv and movies- but they KNOW it's brisket. They were taught well
Headmaster was out here having a food experience 😂😂😂
as a texan if yall think thats good u should try it in the original state. you know what they say—  *Here, Everythings Better* (not sponsored btw, holy shiii that was corny 😭)
I live in Texas, and I’ve never heard it called the Texas fold
For me, the corn bread or muffin is my dessert. When it's warm, smother it in butter. When you are ready to eat it, top it with some honey. Delish
These kids are so well spoken, I wish I spoke real English like them lol
Soo the gift was a sponsorship ad?
Brought out the blackness of those little fuckers😂
They did them dirty with the cornbread. It needs to be sweet cornbread. Also needed poppers! But love the reactions.
best way to eat corn bread is warm with butter and natural maple syrup
I think the headmaster went to heaven lol XD.. God I love this Channel!
I’m getting full from watching this.
God Bless America 🇺🇸
Ah Fred and Monty are disappointed. But I get it - these lads are puritans - they like things traditional and unadulterated.
0:31 The menacing grin. 😂😂😂
In heaven all the food is made in France and cars in Germany.  In HELL all the food is made in England and cars in France.
If this how they react to Texas bbq. Imagen how unconnected tribes will react.
British highschoolers look like American middle schoolers tho 💀🙏
2:24 wonder how they would take a brisket sandwich using some nice bread toast and seasoned
This is like giving a Renaissance kid a bag of Doritos
Bro had a personal vendetta against cornbread lmao
okay but how do you get the food to them?!
You gotta put honey on cornbread next time
Should’ve done honey cornbread
starting out with burnt ends your gonna ruin everything for them from now on. It's pretty much down hill form there. I love that they legit use the bark of the meat immediately to reference it like ya that is bark and it's dam good.
I like these ones
Is that good from the robinsons
They went from forks and knives to wild hyennas in a single course.
Texan born and bred here, and i can't help but feel a little spoiled and quite proud watching how those kiddos went HAM on that spread. I wish the whole world could get a plateful of the things we love here!
Not gonna lie that cornbread did look pretty dry for it to also not have any butter
Yall should try cajun
i'm an american and i realllyyyy want to try this
And this is why Luka became Texan when he was on the Mavs. That man was never going to leave
The headmaster's Saxon ancestors smiled down on him when he bit into that beef rib
The teacher reaction is priceless he’s been around a lot longer than the kids and I know his taste buds are going crazy.
I even thought looking at the Cornbread that it looked at little dry but Cornbread is an art. It can go to dry town really quick but there is good Cornbread that exists.
10:35 honorary american
Burnt stake im crying. I live in TX. I love tx barbaque. They have to try smoked BBQ
"it's not a cup of tea" 🤣
British people try food for the first time. Beautiful 🥹
Dam 9yr old high schoolers
Meat sweats!😂
Their tastebuds will never be the same
They'd probably like the cornbread if it was fresher
As a Texan I'm glad you like the food
As an American who loves BBQ, I was sad for the boys never having good brisket or ribs before.. isn't that child abuse?
Come on ova yall because everyone has a different way of cooking our BBQ
You can never go wrong with some good old fashion Texas Barbecue. 😉  Especially Brisket, it’s so damn good
I’m happy they loved our BBQ☺️ it’s hard to turn down!  I’m from New York, you should try our bagels and pizza :) there are some unique spots like L&B, Brennan and Carrs, and so many nice places on Long Island and in the city
Bring the headmaster! Bring him to Georgia for the biscuits and gravy!  Bring him to Texas for the BBQ!   Would love to see it!
im well versed with the 'texas fold' because for years ive called it a Hovis taco haha
this headmaster loves you guys lol i wonder what offsted or the officials think of it i dont expect them to allow these videos but they keep coming
Perfect for growing boys
That moment when their eyes go back in their head. Priceless.
So happy they also did pork ribs.  I'm from Mississippi, but have lived in Texas for the last 20 years. Steer is king here, and I prefer pork!
Bro I feel bad for the kid at the left in 9:49 it looks like he didn’t get anything compared to his friends
I luv the accents😂❤❤❤❤
He said I had that….. Bread😂😂😂😂😂😂
The crouton comment is so 100% on point.
love this 😂 i keep telling people to try our texas bbq
As a southerner, I hate cornbread too.
Won this round? Hate to be that american but we won the war 😅
All this time I didn’t understand what the bread was meant for 😂
My yung brudda harry was havin a spiritual awakening each time he ate
Seems like the headmaster is enjoying this more than the boys 😂
Whenever people say Americans are notorious for being fat they often forget we have food like this at our disposal everyday🤣
Brisket is the thing we do best in Texas. If you want other good bbq you have to go to Houston and maybe Dallas
As a Texan that Mac n cheese looks weird and im surprised yall didn’t bother to introduce the creamed corn
And they no longer wonder "Why are Americans so overweight?"
My eyes is Wa-ering is crazy
Any of these young gents are welcome to visit the south anytime. Actually anyone is welcome cause we want everyone to taste the food
Maybe it's because I've never had GOOD BBQ and only ever had chain restaurant BBQ, but I'm surprised they didn't like the cornbread! The cornbread is sometimes the best part of the meal (which when I say that aloud does sound silly but I stand by it).
4:14 "And that is what they call a Texas Fold"  I do the same thing Saturday Morning at Bunnings
The teacher is enjoying it so much, he looks high 😂
As a Texas native, it’s incredible to see people from other countries enjoy the best we have to offer!! That platter looks incredible 😭
Those pork ribs didn't look very tender.....
I think they made the cornbread wrong
The brisket is sliced too thick
The dead seriousness in his face saying “this IS the best sandwaich ive ever had!”
My wife makes the cornbread that you'd eat for sure. Another pro move is to put the link in the sliced bread with a bit of mayo "sausage dog" you'd be wanting some to take home for a later meal. Thanks  for the good and honest reactions. From the south of 🇺🇸
It’s like watching blind people see for the first time it’s a beautiful thing
Look at all these future Texans in the making 😂
This just makes me happy to watch 😂.  Plus, how adorable is their headmaster?
The little boy with the curly hair stole my heart. He loved everything besides the beans, lol. I enjoyed that they liked the food. BBQ IS SO YUMMY 😋
Headmaster Smith looking fit 💪
Am I tripping!!? Vadim and Mack just look alike Max and Armand😂😂
"Have you not eaten in a week?" 😂
They did that cornbread dirty. Where’s the Cinnamon butter? Honey!!!!
This is food corn!!!
I love how the instant they see the pit beans, they ALL put it on top of some Texas toast! 😂❤
Y'all did Texas Proud ❤
I LOVE watching people from all over the world enjoying American BBQ! Children are so precious! Thank you for this!
Boujee lol
The cornbread part… that one hurt… pls tell me this one was just made dry, because it can have a softer and moister taste if made differently… The description “bland” baffled me
3:31 I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a Texas fold before lol. It looks pretty good though!
I love these kids. They’re great
"Are you lying" 🤔🤔🤔   "He isn't lying" 😍😍😍
Now wash it down with Pabst Blue Riddon.
Thats food open up another taste buzz in there whole body now u know why alot Americans are over weight 😂😂😂😂
Man I haven't been to the US in three years and now I want to go back just for BBQ.
So who wants to open a Barbq restaurant in London ?
Shoulda put the bbq sauce in the Mac n cheese
These boys are going to get the hardest case of the itis ever. You usually need years of training for a little tolerance
I'm glad Collin Creevey likes the bbq
British baked beans are better than in the United States??! Kid, you’re too young to appreciate finer flavors. 😂
I looooooove pork ribs.
Im still trying to comprehend how he can't comprehend the flavors 😂.
i love the trope of having people try Texan BBQ. As a Texan i love all these vids sharing our food culture with the world.
Yummmmmmmmmm! Too bad I can’t eat ANY of it. 😢. I have serious liver disease and can’t eat beef, pork, french fries, baked beans, most breads…pretty much everything tasty I can’t eat. No alcoholic beverages ever. Sad.
I love the way Harry said “that looks lovely” on 0:55
There could be a whole episode of you guys just giving the headmaster food.😂
I never thought I’d see a mammoth mountain shirt in a video about British highschoolers trying Texas bbq but here we are and it’s iconic
Was the cornbread sweet?
As a Texan I love when people try BBQ for the first time. The time, prep, and variations that goes into it are mind blowing. If ever possible one should go to the Texas state Fair for the food. As well as any of the several BBQ cook-offs during the warm months.
They need to try Carolina BBQ next.  I think we'd win 🏆.  Lol
7:39 Must not have been a sweet cornbread. Either way, drizzle some honey on that and have at it!
Wait till they try Terry Black’s Barbecue
i love the shorts on fb im glad you have a youtube newly subscribed, i enjoy this content
I should open a BBQ restaurant in England.
Harry reminds me of Jacob ward 😂
If I were a restaurateur, I'd watch these videos and build the restaurants to match what the kids go wild for. Like watching this, there's no way a good BBQ joint wouldn't succeed over there
As an American watching this, my mouth is watering, everyone saw food heaven....Take that teacher or headmaster to Texas, Nashville, and St. Louis.
I wish I could have made the cornbread. It sounded bad compared it to croutons.
Should have had them take their coats and ties off.
As a midwesterner, sorry for holding out on you
They look so happy eating, just as god intended
You forgot the Banana Pudding and peach cobbler for desert. Texans also do smoked turkey.
They DID NOT just try Southern cornbread 😂
Southern style bbq is arguably the best food group on the planet
Typical summertime is a backyard swimming pool and family barbecue.
Wait 7th grade is high school in the UK?
Y'all must have made the cornbread wrong, I can tell not only because of their reactions but because I don't see any whole kernels of corn in there
Tbf, that cornbread didn’t look very good
Umm... I'm from Alabama, but if you need someone to test BBQ, well, OK.
The tiny kid reminds me of the villain from Meet the Robinsons
Don’t like pickles huh? Try again
I feel really proud as an American right now lol
11:07 so growing up I felt that too but that’s because my dad would refer to it as “the cheese scab” and I got yucked out by hearing the word scab when referring to food…
Too funny! 👍🏼
That’s right you’re NOT from Texas. Texas wants YOU anyway!!!
👏🏾👏🏾this was so enjoyable 😂❤ so glad y'all enjoyed our regional food.  Sending love from Texas
The sweet tea was a little light. If they're saying its like fruit juice is it maybe too much ice and lemon 🍋 that'll dilute and weaken the tea for sure.
Living in south Texas, when i make my brisket. The burnt ends is always my first bite
"Have you not eaten in a day.."  😂 don't be a hater little friend. Let your friend enjoy his food.  Him and the teacher are invited to come eat anytime.
Bland Cornbread? Someone did you dirty, friend. Sweet Cornbread with honey-butter is the only way to go❤😉
The Brits are awfully quiet in the comments 😂
I can't comprehend living without barbeque. If Im not permitted to have my smoker, I will not live there. It's one of my hardline rules. Pets allowed, smoker and outdoor kitchen allowed
"Lovely" is the best 😂😂
I love how they got the beans the immediately put in on the bread.😂😂
If you don't like the cornbread then you got a bad recipe
0:48 everythings bigger in Texas bub
Theres something so macabre about humans ripping meat off bone with their teeth.
You have to smother the corn bread with melty butter and drizzle local honey on it !!!
YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM CORNBREAD WITH HONEY BROWN SUGAR BUTTER ON IT. THEY WOULD HAVE ALL LOVED IT. MOST CORNBREAD IS DRY UNLESS YOU MAKE IT THE RIGHT WAY.
AI slop used for the clipart. Christ is it so hard to just google some free clipart now
Have you done this with American kids and UK food? I love the flavor discovery  here
Hello from Texas!!! My favorite is burnt ends❤
How did you get the food all the way over there?
Love the teacher
I love these videos,  but the boy eating with his mouth wide open,  kills it for me.  I'll never understand how a parent doesn't teach their kids to chew with their mouth closed.  Just gross.
These kids are fun to watch 😊
They are inventing new words, new phrases and word combinations each time they taste the food.
You guys got to give them butter with the cornbread!
Burnt ends are not Texas BBQ, they are from Kansas City. Though I do agree it’s the best cut of BBQ you can get.
This has actually brought up some pride for my country.  Im pleased theyve all enjoyed themselves.
Bless those young ones! ❤❤
We’d be happy to have any of them. We’d feed them as much bbq as they could stand, take them mudding, and noodling, and to the range. We’d show them boys a good time. 😁
Gotta put the chilli on the corn bread 😂
they are such smart well spoken kids man good too see
As a Texan, this makes my heart happy and so proud. It's the greatest compliment to see these kids having a life changing experience that is going to stick with them forever.
No offense but seeing the slop they eat on a daily basis im not surprised they loved it and also didnt like some good ass mac n cheese or cornbread theyre taste buds just arent used to anything that isnt liquidy/covered in beans 😭
Everything is bigger in TEXAS.😂 Even our appetite. 😂😂😂
Love you guys. Also love when you get the young chaps involved.
If they came to Texas and tried TRUE Texas BBQ, they would be further mind blown.
I love how they included the instructor
That wee fella that keeps saying "that's lovely" makes me so happy
These kids gonna go home and tell their parents this is all they want
The principal was born on the wrong continent..😂😂
as a resident of central texas, who is not actually from the region, i can attest to brisket being one of the best things i have ever eaten un my life.  and the fold is superb, but I'm a wet brisket lover.  i knew brisket only as "corned beef" before i came here.
Does josh and Ollie just hire a bunch of private American chef in England for these episodes cuz 😂😅 how on earth
Bring the principal with you
Highschoolers?! They look like middle schoolers 😂
And the iced tea on the side is a must. Lol.
That’s jealous had me rolling 😂
Never understood the hype for cornbread.
U gotta put honey on the corn bread.
Should have had honey butter for the cornbread.  Not fair to the kids
LOL! As an American who grew up on these kind of foods, I love watching these videos. Totally hilarious! These kind of things are not just made in southern states. Also very popular in the North Western States too. Plus, there are BBQ restaurants all over the U.S. in different towns or cities.
Burnt ends are KC BBQ not Texas
America has soul food and southern BBQ and somehow we get accused of having the blandest food meanwhile Brits are terrified of black pepper let alone spices
a
😂😂 he says, " I don't even think I can eat food here anymore. "
There must be a reason why you have the highschoolers separated by race, right?
1:1

“My mouth is mesmerized”  is diabolical 💀😂
These kids definitely fell asleep in class after that meal. lol 😂
give these kids socal tacos now…
I live outside of Fort Worth. This made me smile.
These ages have to be wrong
half the time they’re just saying “oh my goshhh!” while watching kids stuff their faces full
I’m getting ready to go to dinner. They cook for us at work and we never know what we’re having until we get there. I really hope it’s BBQ!😂
Field trip to Buccees!
Cornbread goes well with chocolate milk believe it or not
I’m Canadian, and BBQ is a huge part of the culture in my specific area. BUT even I have to admit Texas BBQ is a different beast. And I LOVE it.
Made a mistake giving them cornbread after brisket and beef ribs. Corn bread is so good with a bowl of chili. IMO the best time for cornbread.
Let em eat some Korean bbq next. If u guys come to LA, try jjuku jjuku
i couldnt imagine not eating like this on a regular basis, this is just another day for a man with a smoker
They yearn for the flavor!
The sausage that they are eating is called a hot link
You gotta put some butter on your corn bread fellas.
“Oh my days”   I love British people man 😂😂😂
You must take the cornbread and crumble it on top of your baked beans
Sweet cornbread is the best with some creamed corn and extra sugar!!!!
I live in the Midwest and rarely have barbecue because I don’t want to take the time to make it myself and all the barbecue places charge $1 million
행님들 이제 한국자막은 안달아주는건가요?
how are those kids high schoolers lol they’re like 10
Y’all need to find soon some girls to join the eaters!
Their doing Gods work
Texas BBQ is the greatest thing I've ever had, and the food coma is the greatest feeling
So brisket is the way it is cooked? Like you could have pork or lamb or beef brisket?
That ain’t no real southern Mac and cheese, we don’t do that bread crumb stuff and it should have been made with cheddar not that white cheddar stuff
Hi good evening
God I want some pork belly
ooooh they shoulda had jiffy cornbread and ate it as dessert 😅😂  it looks dry here😅
Damn that looks delicious
Suddenly they all understand why Americans are fat lol. Because we have food like this everywhere. Lol
Rare footage of UK denizens eating good food and not war food
try some of our N.C. pulled pork next!
I live in Georgia, this is what we eat on Fourth of July and some parts of that on Christmas. Some of the best food I've ever had. I love eating, so these days are my favorite days.
2:52 Ollie is the absolute best 😅❤
you GOTTA put maple syrup on the cornbread
Hot buttered cornbread.... heaven.
Corn muffins will always be better than cornbread. Even if you use the same ingredients, it does change the flavor and it 100% changes the consistency.
They're all so cute!!! And to be fair, I'm not a big fan of plain cornbread either (and I'm from South Carolina!). Instead, make it with buttermilk, and put whole corn (and maybe chopped pickled jalapenos) in it... do be sure to pre-heat the cast-iron skillet and the shortening in the oven so that when you pour the batter in, it sizzles. Then serve it hot with a little pat of really good butter... THAT's cornbread  But it's quite flattering to see people enjoy the food you think of as everyday, just-what-you-make-for-dinner-type food 🥰 Cheers from Georgia!
What school they attend I want my sons there
I'm in Texas and seeing these guys love our barbecue makes me happy.. they should taste my potato salad it's the best.And I could change that kids mind about cornbread..🤣🤣
Guys! My bf is from Australia, and i want to do this with him. But I live on the West Coast! Does anyone know where I can get some good Texas barbecue???
Guys!! CORNBREAD with CHILI. Not one person tried this classic combo.
Brisket is the Rolls-Royce of BBQ.
They definitely gon' have the meat sweats.
That baby said my eyes are watering 😂
I LOVE seeing the reaction of these young lads trying some of our best dishes.
And then they wonder why we eat what we do lol
“This is lovely” boy is definitely studying abroad for college 😂
"I dont think I can eat food here anymore" 😂 these poor kids being down some of the best southern food and have to go back to their beans on bread.
Texan here, the cornbread wasn’t done proper. No one would ever eat cornbread and say it’s bland.
I’m guessing you didn’t bring real southern cornbread with honey and butter, I’m with em on the Mac n cheese I don’t like bread crumbs on mine and I like it more gooey I don’t like over thick.
I’m guessing you didn’t bring real southern cornbread with honey and butter
I can just see that one kid who said he would eat bbq everyday, going home walking in the door yelling "mom! I had Texas BBQ today and we are moving to America!!!"
As an American these videos make me feel a sense of pride lol
That mac and cheese needed to go... That's not how you make mac and cheese...and that cornbread ain't south south..Texas bbq is different from Carolina's bbq just like Memphis BBQ so that cornbread doesn't rep no but Texas
It is so much fun watching the British trying real BBQ for the first time.
Show them how to cook it. Let the boyz be self sufficient
God i love being an American so people can try this type of food
They should KC BBQ.
I haven't had lunch today 💀
That sandwich minus the pickles is an elite anddddd you need to give them sweeeeeet corn bread not bland corn bread 😖
😂 Yeeeaaaaa it’s summertime in America, it’s nothing but Q in the air!!
So d9 these kids ever age?
Take these kids to a Proper BBQ place!! Let them eat good and proper, they need more meat on their bones.
Y'all should have thrown some bacon cured collard greens in the mix
So happy to see Jolly going to impoverished countries and feeding them good food
Here in Texas, we say that Texas BBQ is a spiritual experience. You can see that on their faces. 😂I love their reactions! However, HOW can you not like cornbread? Who made that cornbread???  Come on now. 🤣🤣🤣
The bulging eyes when they took bites out of the beef ribs sent me! So good! But yeah, cornbread is an acquired taste
Essen bringt Menschen zusammen
You forgot the honey for the cornbread
Such a great joyess video....and made me so dang hungry lol...gana have to smoke something on the grill today!
Something about that one kid cutting everything while holding the knife and fork in the most posh way possible is just making me laugh
I love watching black kids eat ribs for the first time
The quality of cornbread can vary significantly based on the recipe; I've encountered instances where the texture and flavor were undesirable, reminiscent of cardboard. Furthermore, I generally do not prefer cornbread that includes whole kernels. However, when well-prepared, the quality of cornbread is immediately apparent.
“I’m still comprehending the flavors!”😂😂 When it’s so good you can’t compute yet. 🇺🇸
Watching this makes me want to start up my grill! Especially for a brisket! 😋
Im more impressed that they ate it properly.. it starter out forks knives but ended bare hands the proper way!
So all I see is Hogwarts students eating muggle bbq. 😂
You have to put sugar in the cornbread or it's like eating paper or cardboard.
They make fun of us for being obese until they try our food.
Seriously, bring these children to America. Bring them up here to Page Arizona to big John’s Texas barbecue. We will fill them up with hotlinks, beefribs, brisket, pulled pork, barbecued chicken, baby back ribs, coleslaw, cornbread, baked beans the likes of which they’ve never had before some Texas sheet cake or angel food cake with strawberries and homemade whip cream to and some sweet tea or Texas lemonade to wash it all down. Authentic open and smoked Texas barbecue in northern Arizona. Then we will send them over to the Grand Canyon to have their minds blown again.
Not a beef sausage it’s a hot link. Do not lie to these children.
Need to try Joe's Kansas City BBQ from Kansas City, then you will be really excited about BBQ 😁
How do you get all that authentic food to England? Not just the bbq, but all the different food you give them?
They going to be in a food coma
It's odd that the 'Dino Ribs' the kids had look NOTHING like the ones served at Terry Black's and Goldees when Josh and Oliver went to those places 🤔
regular mac and cheese > baked mac and cheese.
Put some butter and maybe honey on that cornbread!! They need some jiffy or similar!
The headmaster is killing me 🤣🤣
Lol as soon as they touched the cornbread i knew it wasnt good cornbread. 😂 As an American that ISNT from the south. You dont get GOOD cornbread away from the south. I ruined cornbread for myself eating it in New Orleans
Never knew that the uk doesnt have pickles
Imagine the money if you opened a BBQ shop there
Why didn't they take off their jackets?
Everything looks good but the brisket
Super curious about the cornbread. Im assuming its sweet but we also have not sweet cornbread. I never know which states each which kind. Im from NY lol. I personally only like it sweet.
Nawl tell my boi he can’t be dissing cornbread
The Brits are trying to introduce flavor into their food by way of the youth and in America, our youth introduced to a whole different mess.😂😂😂
Please invite me next time 😂😂😂
Wait until they have something seasoned
Give ‘em some Kansas City BBQ! Similar, but…well, I’ll hold my opinion, I don’t need to start a war in the comments. 😂 It’s definitely a necessary taste experience, 100%
No beef ribs or barbeque sauce and that be the best part way better than brisket
I'm jealous
Oh man! AI generated pictures 😔
its nice to see people from the UK actually trying stuff instead of just saying America has no good food
They always say Everything Bigger in Texas and we mean it , we have some of the best BQQ in my opinion
Americans while watching, singing the American anthem, so proud
Can’t Beat Beans with Melted Cheese on Toast
Give em a tomahawk steak next! 🗣️
I wanna see them try Hawaiian BBQ / Polynesian Food
Okay so if they're in Britain whose cooking the food?
I'm jealous, being able to taste Southern BBQ for the first time again would be amazing.
10:18 same bro
"Have you not eaten the whole week?"😂😂😂
Great video! those kids looked like they enjoyed, and honestly i think a food tour with the headmaster is in order! 😀 One thing i'd say: that cornbread looked incredibly dry. Was there no butter included?
In their defense, that cornbread was a lil dry
This is making me so homesick ❤ I’m glad people across the globe or out food as much as we do in Texas
Why are they so short
The comments are telling me if I bring a British friend to a southern BBQ you might give us free brisket
I don't know if the Brits are getting this right, but it looks as though they eat a lot of things without the barbecue sauce. They just ate it dry and that's only 2/3 of the experience, or 1/3 of it in some people's view. Additionally, they gave them cornbread without butter or honey. Some use one or both, but you don't just typically eat the cornbread plain... Retards!   If you're going to bring American barbecue over to Britain, you got to do it right. Wake up limeys!
Authentic Mexican food would hit these kids like an atom bomb.
Now, after this, how can you ever go back to a british barbecue
What is a Maccas?
Where the honey butter at for the cornbread
The cornbread they need is the one I grew up on in south Texas I mean towards Brownsville south, it’s corny cornbread, it’s as it sounds, and not as bland and dry
I love this!!!!
I wish there were Beef sausages near where I lived. Only ever find pork ones.
9:17 Listen you two, you don’t get to judge newbies for their rib eating when I remember you two Very DISTINCTLY being scolded for trying to eat ribs with a fork.  😂
Time to get these kids on an American Road Trip. Let them see how big The South and Texas really are. Take them to Dollywood!
Love this video but if you want good BBQ, specifically burnt ends you gotta go KC or Oklahoma.
To borrow a joke from a funnier person than I will ever be, I'm pretty sure that they just "Flowers for Algernon"ed these kids tastebuds
It pains me to see them using a fork
I love BBQ i would like to make BBQ feast ribs brisket hamburgers brats pulled pork baked macaroni and cheese baked beans potato salad deviled eggs roasted corn on the cob homemade BBQ sauce now i just need to get me indoor grill with bourbon lemon sweet tea water and for desserts Brownie Trifle rice crispy treats and fruit salad plus something to cool down the heat ice cream with all sweet toppings and homemade whipped cream
"it's like eating a pillow" exactly how I imagined meat tastes like when I was a kid from watching cartoons 😭😭😭 I WANT THAT MEATTTT
Wait, do they not have pickles on the regular in the UK?
They needed the sweet cornbread not the bland one
This video is evil... Imagine you have burnt ends or a nice beef rib and it's just wonderful... But you realize you dont live in the states... You'll crave it so much... But you might never have it again... Horrific.   But actually lovely video!
10:34 that’s exactly how I felt when I visited Texas and went back to Oregon 😆
7:46 when you go to Louisiana, you can crumble up the corn bread into the red beans and rice and i learned that as a kid
Food looks amazing. I want some.  What happened to Theo?
I can only imagine the look on their parent’s faces when they come home from school and ask for brisket for dinner.  You guys must be giving their parents head aches 🤣
As an American, this makes me smile, we have a very diverse.  Pick a food here in the stat is a beautiful thing.  All cultures kind of blending together to make our American culture and I absolutely love it.  Glad your kids are enjoying this food.Hope you get to experience in the state someday❤
I get so tired of seeing people slag off American cuisine. While it's obviously not all good, it's not all garbage. It's nice to see people enjoying it.
I actually like watching these British kids faces when they take their first bite...
What can you say other than God Bless America
I don't know if ya noticed, but the young man name mack could one day work as Brad Pitts face double. He looks like he could be his younger relative 🤣
They’ll be chasing that dragon for the rest of their lives
I had my first brisket (in my 30's) when I moved to Ohio for a year... I swear (after that) I ordered at least once a week. Brisket is a drug. 😂
That was the best one. 😂
As an American I feel like wearing a suit at school is equally a culture shock
They’ve never had food this good 😂😂😂
idk if yall tried it yet but have them try mexican food from texas
Zadok the brisket
Good choice
As a Texan watching this episode made me very happy. I was so glad that they loved the barbecue.
If you want a good brisket and authentic you gotta go to a random street in the middle of Texas and then you find it
You know it’s good when it seems like all they’re parents have starved their kids 🤣
0:58 Ethan you can leave at any point...
Watching them put the beans on the bread killed me inside. BEANS DON'T BELONG ON TOAST!
Listen, as a native Texan who has been watching these adorable young men eat all kinds of things…I am so pleased that Texas has entered the building!! Love it. Just FYI, don’t say “Southern BBQ , it’s just Texas Bar BQ. We don’t concern  ourselves with the rest of the south, it’s different. 😎❤️
As a Texan, I think our BBQ is the best!
12:28 “British baked beans” aren’t a thing. They’re originally from US and Canada. And the specific type of baked beans eaten now was given to the British by the Americans during ww2 as rashions. And heinz is American.
My question is how do they cook this in Europe? Do they have like people from America over there?
i love how a probably mid bbq has british people saying it’s the best thing they ever ate, like the food over there is so bad lol
"I love beans"  What an absolute legend
Cornbread has to be moist, made with a little bit of honey, and slathered and salty butter. Some people prefer the plain cornbread but I just think it literally has no flavor whatsoever like I can't deal with it. Plus a little bit of sweet cuts through all of that salty Savory food that you just had
Adorable, I love you they are young and will to try everything once ❤
Need to make an “Arnold Palmer” for them (Sweet tea and Lemonade). So refreshing on a hot day
I can see the parents insisting their boys eat at this activity, saving on the food bill!
These young lads are more appreciative and patriotic than most democrats and liberals lol
I love the teachers reaction jyst as much as the kids. You can tell he is feeling heaven at moments.
I tend to agree with the cornbread. I need to, at the least, have butter on it.
The youngster at 2:43 took one hit of the brisket and was already getting the itis!
I'm across the country from my home in Georgia and this makes me miss southern BBQ  SO MUCH! 😭😭
Telling southerns not to make cornbread is blasphemy! Lol
I'm American so could someone explain to me the pickles part?  Pickles are just pickled cucumbers here (using pickling cucumbers specifically don't use the wrong cucumber or it won't turn out good lol) but do they not have pickles in the UK or do you have a different kind? It just seemed like they hadn't had pickles before so I was curious.
Cornbread is best when warm and with butter.
When is joe reacting
I live in texas and i hate tex mex, texas bbq is ok, i prefer kc, but i love watching these videos
I really think southern barbecue is the true American cuisine.
But, seriously why do the beans have to go on the bread?
Its so amusing seeing you guys try american food and then you guys go share it with school kids and their teacher back home. Love it.
a poor sheep had to die for these kids to eat. so sad save the animals 😢
so glad you're sharing my states pride and joy
Now imagine when you come down here and have it for real. Once you can get some boiled peanuts on the drive at every gas station, you know you’re  in the right place!
“Imma go American now” 😂
How are they getting the food there? Or do they have a chef in their country
you are nottttt making Mac and cheese the best way if there's the breadcrumbs on top😟
British don’t like beans is crazy
Hearing Pomp and Circumstance played over ribs is great
I ate while watching this and I’m so glad
Who made that cornbread?🧐
It is rather funny you used Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 for the background music to the ribs. I know it is somewhat of a patriotic song in the UK, but in the US it is exclusively for graduations and is very rarely heard out of that context. So, I only thought of the ribs graduating lol.
The technical term for the resistance felt when biting through the casing on a sausage is the technically called the "snap"
Damn, the hate on cornbread.  Which I kind of get, it is pretty bland.  But it's a filler, like rice for Asian dishes.  You eat it with the main meal or slather it with butter and eat it.  It's just "meh" alone.
Should take them to see how its made you know when its all calm down there...
Love from Texas, glad they love it so much
Okay here's the thing we all make cornbread different and if it's not from an aunty it's never good so I get them
Is it any wonder that too many of us are overweight or prediabetic or diabetic. Too much of tasty things, It can be sad at times.
13:04 "southern tea" lol thats most southern foods. They take foods from other places and cultures, put a spin on it and call it southern.
Watching these videos makes me wonder what the hell do they eat in the UK then
Texan here (San Antonio)!!!!! Absolutely love everyone’s reaction to southern BBQ food. 😂❤ Have the kiddos try Mexican food from deep in the heart of Texas. Tex-Mex.
I live in Texas and dont like corn bread either
We love our BBQ here in America,  but I’m pretty sure it shaves years off our lives
The young man on the end the first young black guy he killed his food I don't blame him.
They are so used to eating pork and beans they don't know what good beans are That's all that is they eat pork and beans for breakfast lunch so of course.😊 But the schoolmaster get it
that one kid at 2:00 looks like Goob from "Meet the Robinsons" lol
Its dangerous introducing the British to flavor, last time they were interested in herbs and spices they conquered the world
All that way...and it wasn't Kansas City BBQ
Perfect example of why many Americans are so big when that kid says he would eat it every day. Like yup people do that here.
I wonder where they source this food. Like do they order it and have it shipped on a 12-16 hour flight? Or do they source ingredients and have someone with the know how make it?
Cornbread is absolutely delicious and yes I am from Texas so biased.  You do, really need, butter or as sweeter people like, honey with corn bread.  If you want Godlike level then top your cornbread with Texas chili (no beans).  Eat deliciously, my friends ❤❤
Not gonna lie you set those kids up for major disappointment. They are going to expect that all over America even though you said it was Texas BBQ so they are gonna get to like New York or something and ask for BBQ and it's going to be trash.
I wonder if it was actually smoked with Hickory, Mesquite, Applewood or Pecan or was it just tasteless slow cooked meat? The wood makes all the difference.
As someone who loves corn bread enough to have corn bread on my birthday rather than cake. I was offended by their lack of respect for the cornbread. Then again, who gives someone corn bread without butter or anything to put on it.😂😂😂 Great video
Great Britain,   This is your chance to become the 51st state.
Texan here, y’all should’ve had some sweet cornbread!
These kids are starting to understand why so many Americans are overweight.
I live like 3 minute walk from this place called stanleys bbq in Texas.  I don't realize how good we got it. ❤
I love how different their palates are from each other❤
This video is the love child of the only videos I’ve watched on your channel  Y’all trying bbq, and British highschoolers trying things Love it
맛나겟다... 근데 보기만해도 김치가 땡긴다.
I agree with that one kid. I don't like cornbread much myself either. It is so bland, but if I am given it I feel like I need to eat it to not be rude. I just feel like I have to slog through it every time. It's just gross.
Texan and Missouri BBQ is just amazing! (I myself am partial to a good pulled pork sandwhich)
Why not let the Girls Have a Go??
How are you getting this food to the UK freah?
Brits experience flavor for the first time.
Yeah, were the biggest Bastards in the world, but our food is almost to die for.
I used to want to go to England to visit historic places but I'd die from starvation.
These kids are EVERYTHING in this video. It makes me realize what we take for granted in the US of A
you should have put butter and honey on the corn bread💔
It's so interesting to hear so many different taste perspectives. The differences in each person. They all love the meat for sure though, such amazing appreciation.
Indeed, I will confirm proper Texas slow cooked brisket is, in fact, a spiritual experience.  My daddy smoked briskets for my wedding dinner.  People still talk about it and it will be 20 years in October. So good.
😂❤️ watching these videos. It blows my mind what some people have never had and really enjoy, compared to what some of us take for granted! 🤗
As an American I absolutely love this content. We take for granted the wonderful goods we get to enjoy. Seeing others try them, even if they don’t like them, is great fun.
13:39 Monty, corn bread is a delicacy here in Georgia. 😭
The cornbread needed a ton of butter to add on and it’s usually best fresh and hot
The way Vadim just stuffed the brisket in😂
That one kid telling the south never to make cornbread again doesn’t know his close he came to starting a war.
Taste the freedom, Brits! WTF IS A KILOMETER?!!!!! 🦅🦅🦅🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🪖🪖🪖🎆🎆💣💣💥💥💥🔫🔫🔫
they're tasting seasoning for the first time
I love how you can almost taste the food with these guys. Makes watching it so much more immersive.
This the best one, shut it down
Willcharn where you at bro
Now do you see why we have an obesity problem here? 🤣
Boys! Tell them to prepare you foods smoked with different types of wood! The wood you use makes a  BIG difference in the resulting flavor. Hickory, Oak, Apple, Pear, Plum, Cherry, Sassafras and so many more each imparts a different set of flavors to the smoke and thus the meats cooked with them. My personal favorite is Sassafras, a North America special and the base flavor of many Root Beer formulae. Meat smoked with Sassafras wood has a unique tingle on the tongue that I've never experienced with any other smoked meat...
I want you to do this at my school
You can tell that’s not sweet corn bread and they don’t have any butter or honey to eat with the cornbread. So rude 😂😂
Awe.. not the same kids before. Nonetheless, I am glad these boys enjoyed the meal
LOL you guys need to take the Headmaster to the US for a round of food.
2:44 Been there…no coming back
Pickles in a milkshake is insanity.
Brits discovering that food can actually be flavorful?! 🤪🤪🤪😂😂😂
As a Texan, this warms my heart to see their joy while eating.
To be fair that's the reaction most people have to eating cornbread
Just curious...who provides the American food?
Ate that, went home and passed the F out lol
Take the beans off the bread
cornbread's best moist, hot, and drizzled with honey
Be sure and tell them they are eating $75 worth of brisket & RIBS EACH!!!
Bro said wibs 😂 8:45
What a great video! Everyone so ready to try, even the things they know they might not like. And some FUNNY reactions here!  Question though, as one kid mentioned the beans weren't better than British baked beans - I've honestly never seen anything about real British baked beans outside of popping a can of Heinz and dumping it straight onto a plate. Can someone clarify if there's actually a more home-cooked way the Brits make their beans?
I'm 4 days into a 7 day fast why am I watching this.
Cornbread SUCKS🤢
England propaganda. Highschoolers are not this well behaved
Word of advice: move the microphones. Hearing people gulping down drinks and smacking food is DISGUSTING. Won’t be watching in the future
Been around the world and no other meat dish compares to a messy plate of Southern BBQ. It really is the pinnacle of intercultural RnD.
I literally don't understand how they could have eaten so much food
When eating cornbread, the way to go is to pair it with beans or a good amount of butter
THEY TASTED FREEDOM!!! 💪💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🛢️🛢️🛢️🛢️🛢️🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫💣💣💣💣
Make them try Greek food you won’t regret it!
Hearing orchestral anthems behind this makes this all the funnier as a texan. 😆
I just realized I got tricked into watching a mukbang
They wasn’t ready for it !!!!!
A proper representation of Texas barbecue, I am a happy Texan right this moment
Their description of brisket prior to actually trying it comes from not being able to fathom what’s even going on with it.
It is always good to see children eat!
I don't usually eat cornbread with my bbq. I reserve it for my chili with beans.
Uk here. I need to try all of this. Immediately please
I love seeing kids who’ve been deprived of flavor for years finally get some good food in their moths 😂😂
Man, if a Southerner opened an authentic BBQ restaurant in England, they'd pretty much print money
Stop giving these kids early onset heart disease 🙏😭
Cornbread is really good but it depends how they make it
Please stop shiting on corn bread
Texas bbq for the win 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I swear tho there’s a mf out there that would swear on their life that fish and chips are better than
That corn bread did not look like the corn bread that I've had
Whoever that 7th year boy is with the curly brown hair and hes on the left of the screen, he is DARLING! just so cute and he loves every second.  Edit: OMG HIS NAMES HARRY! He is DARLING.  “That looks lovely 😊”
I'm convinced the headmaster stays in his role to keep enjoying the food 😂
I need to know, was it sweet or salty cornbread? The difference is huge! If they didn't like the first one, give them the other one!
The Mac n cheese part is insane!
Butter the cornbread
The "thats lovely" kid has to much aura ngl😂
Nice a Texas small.
lol every time any of the kids take a bite it looks like they’re going on the nicest psychedelic trip ever. The salt and sugar is really hitting them.
Do they not eat pickles in the uk?
The principal is the only one that ate them right LOL I don't eat them on bread unless I throw some pulled pork on it.
Then you have idiots like Tom Holland who don't think American food exists lol
You should get them to try some new Mexico food.
The two boys flash back omg I forget how hard puberty hits boys 😂😂😂
Their first instinct was to put the beans on the bread 😂
My grandpa always said “everything tastes better between a piece of white bread” 😂😭 (usually when my grandma’s cooking wasn’t the best)
That one kid that looks like Sebastian Stan tho 😂
This is why i love food, true unity! Lol
why your friend with you seem always like a sociopath?
rich and cringe people are in an other world
0:47 you know what else is massive?
Have you thought of giving them foods from Maine? It's sad that the can't come to Maine aome of our specialists. I really thinkbthe teacher would have the time of his life.
It's hilarious how they all put the beans on bread.
Don't you have pickles in the UK?
Britain does seem to have horrible food.. I mean how many videos are there of these guys eating meat and bread.. and they act like they have never tasted anything like that when literally they eat meat and bread as well...
They got a taste of no free healthcare
Aye yo Brit’s we appreciate yal thank u from AMERICA love these video reactions
There’s something about watching kids loving the food I grew up on that makes me a little emotional :,)
this is my fave post so far!  the way their eyeballs roll in their heads.. all british ettiquette out the window.. lol.  anyway..i haven't even had texas bbq and i live in usa.. but the ex could melt your brain with his smoker anyday as weill..  any man worth his salt and want to melt tongues and minds must practice with a good smoker.
All that fat is gonna run right through them. Poor kids dont know whats coming 😅
WHERE IS KOREAN SUB
Why are all your British high schoolers boys? Where are the girls? They also have taste buds and opinions!
Have them try butter, honey, or molasses on the cornbread next time
america
As an American who regularly eats Mac and Cheese, I can confirm putting bread crumbs on top of the cheese is not it 😅
No one eats DRY CORNBREAD put some butter on it
I agree about bringing the headmaster to the US but ALSO, PLEASE bring Guvna B & Barney!!! I would watch both those series! Or bring the 3 all together?! That would be fun! ❤😂❤👍💯
Now they need Big Red soda to go with that BBQ
this is like the most salt a british person has ever consumed
We put honey on the cornbread
As a Texan, I agree with their feelings on cornbread. It needs to stop lol everyone in Texas please understand that your cornbread is so dry and tasteless. If you're not gonna put effort into making good tasting cornbread then please make something else, I beg you lol
LOVE THIS!! Love their accents the reactions are priceless 😂😂😂 I’d like to see them try more southern food …
I'm so happy y'all love our Texas food. Hugs and blessings from the  Texas Gulf Coast.
Wheat did y'all do to the cornbread? Bland cornbread is a sin I'll have you know! 😂
British Highschoolers pt2. ❤❤❤ already loving it.
They all have different colored ties like in Hogwarts 😅😅
As a person from the south saying don’t make cornbread again hurt some where inside 😢😂
Creating future US tourists one bite at a time 😂
11:20 poor guy has been eating "sloppy" and "runny" mac & cheese his whole life?!?! 😂😂
They would have liked the cornbread if it was done properly, with REAL BUTTER AND HONEY on top!!!!
Yall gotta put a little bit of onion 🧅 in that Texas fold lol
The one looks like brad pitt
Lol, with the cornbread, looks like you didn't use Jiffy.
How do they get it so fresh? Did a Texas BBQ pitmaster come to the UK?
The Texas fold hit the headmaster right in the soul. Do you have guys have the recipe you used cause I’m here to try all briskets home and far
I put so much butter and maple syrup in my cornbread 😂 it's illegal.
Oh baby that cornbread was a dryyy they need to come to a aunties house to get that real southern cornbread! 😂
It's enough to make hank hill cry!
It’s Texas bbq not North Carolina not Virginia but Texas bbq pure flavor don’t need to be covered in sauce
How you gonna do this to the kids? You gave them something that they probably wont ever get to try again and will be chasing this flavor for the rest of their lives lol.
Eat up..........this isnt banger and mash !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What do you mean your macaroni is runny😰 why is your macaroni wet?! Its not supposed to be moist😭💔
As a born and raised Texan this makes my heart grow 10x to know people across the world enjoy bbq as much as we do.
That headmaster was clearly born in the wrong country lol
soooo british students go to america series? 😂
That's not good cornbread
13:52  🤣 some cornbread is sweet like cake. In my opinion, that’s the best cornbread! If it’s just salt, it’s bland! 🤣🤣🤣
omd i would die for some brisket
I am from Texas, and I have never thought to call it a fold or Texas fold. That's brilliant 🤣🤣🤣
As a Southern, my question is how did you get that back to the UK without eating all of it.
They're learning how Britishers colonised half the world and just looted money. Had they "borrowed" cooking techniques and spice use advise, they'd have good food too.
We’ve won every round son 😂
texas bbq was a great place to start its a lot of simple familiar flavors kicked up by 1000.  they only get more complex and scary after this hahaha
It’s too much zoomed in, but still good, great job 👏
As a someone who lives in Austin Texas. I appreciate you for enjoying BBQ!
these kids must have the time of their lives and they are going to tell their parents about it and they are going to be so jealous!!! and I guess we can agree we all love mr smith 😁😁
10:33 why Does it look like he doesn't like it everytime again😭
I WANT TO HAVE THAT TOO OH MY
I'm SO glad you gave them fatty brisket... it's the ONLY way to go! 👌👌👌
I don’t even know the words to describe how I feel watching other people experience food I have eaten since I was young. Makes me wonder what their food is like
Josh, I loved you in the movie "Antitrust"! I know it's not you, but watch it and you'll see who's I'm talking about.
11:06 I love how hurt Ollie looks at him not liking the crusty bit of the mac n' cheese.
Okay I think they just didn’t get good cornbread because a warm, not dry cornbread with some butter is HEAVENLY. Aside from that these kids have such cute reactions to our food
The one thing we Americans do right is bbq. This is one of the reasons why we are so fat.
Another texan hereee>:D glad that ppl outside of the states are eating some food from over here>:) also ya cornbread is a bit bland ish but u don't have to be mean about it>:(
The cornbread slander will not be tolerated
Hey Jolly, where's the girls at? We like to eat too. Get our opinion. We might be able to articulate how we feel about the food better 😊
English cuisine is bland
Can we all agree English is ....😂😂, that's why they are having an out of this world experience
Next time give them Johnny bread (most ppl call it cornbread) it’s got more sugar and is amazing with bbq or any Louisiana dish
The can instantly tell they are British because they put it on toast.    That would be illegal in the USA 🇺🇸
I am smiling as i watch this
The way I actually gasped when he said "never make cornbread again" 😅 I grew up with cornbread, corn mush, grits, boiled & roasted corn, hominy, corn stew, etc... it's hard not to take it personal when corn has been integral for over a 1000 years on my continent.
The cornbread doesn’t look like TX cornbread
It's kind of funny watching the boys grow up and Mr. Smith just basically looks the same. I'm so happy they enjoyed their barbecue experience!
Honey cornbread is next level and pairs amazingly well with BBQ.
Cornbread is awesome must be a bad batch. It’s supposed to be warm also.
Brisket is my favorite!! ❤️ 😊
You really did those kids a disservice by not putting honey and butter on the cornbread.
its funny because in texas cornbread recipes are all over the place and they are either the worst thing ever conceived or spicer than indian curry or bordering on being fluid. dont worry even in dallas people have mixed feelings on cornbread lol.
I’m a Texan, so this makes me so happy to see them enjoying themselves eating!
I'm SO jealous of these high schoolers! To experience Texas BBQ for the first time again would be a dream! God I miss good Texas BBQ Brisket 🥰
Should of gave them Honey glazed cornbread or cornbread with jalapenos and sweet corn inside. If your using store bought corn bread. Always use Jeffy.
Eating soul food with suit on is wild and impressive
And this is why we are overweight out here....    lmao!!😂
13:40, that’s when the South declared war on the U.K.
British people learning what American love looks like.
Esse videoo é bom demais
I’m from Illinois and I will say, no one does BBQ better that Texas
Can I have a premuim or you got no balls?
North Carolina BBQ is so much better then only thing Texas has is the size of
Recommendation for the corn bread; Use the recipe on the back of a Jiffy box, but don’t use the mix. Just soak your own corn meal in buttermilk (or soured milk) and use that.   My family recipe is half way between corn bread and Johnny cake, but on the less sweet side. So you might want to add more sugar to make em understand our love bit more.  And! You could give them some good gumbo. Cornbread always tastes great with some homemade gumbo.
No you understand why I’m fat. I live here. :)
No butter on the cornbread is a cardinal sin 😂😂
well as a American, the UK seems a bit different then I would have imagined. A bit dark, which seems to make very little sense..... I'm glad they enjoyed our food at least..
Watching Brits taste flavor for the first time.
Highschooler? 7 and 9?
I'll say our tea isn't really tea lol but they are spot on with that cornbread.  It doesn't belong with barbecue. With  chili, it would be would be ok .
The thing is. This is British people cooking for other British people. Can you imagine how they'd react if it was cooked by a southern American. Maybe they did a good job but based on their reaction to the cornbread and the baked pork-n-beans, they messed something up at some point
Watching kids chomp down Texas bbq is so nice
I could watch the headmasters reactions all day
That headmaster is living his best life 😂
Nah kid needs to try beans and cornbread with maple syrup that's the way to eat cornbread
As a southerner, you don't put breadcrumbs on top of mac and cheese. 😂
Bro as an autistic girl from Texas ribs are my safe food 😭😭😭
The end where the young man said "Please, never make cornbread again". My grandmother, wife and cousins all grabbed their guns and a singular racking of slides and Chambers were heard all across the south. To said young man. We have rednecks and personal armories all across this great country. There are things you don't insult here. The order of those things are: God, Momma, our wives, and mommas cooking (this includes the secret family recipes for cornbread that always starts with a box or two of Jiffy cornbread mix).
You did the wrong corn bread!! I make mine with honey mixed in & then halfway thru cooking I pour another CUP or more on top, then at the very end I broil it for a minute to get just a light crisp on the honey. Its basically honey-bread!
Wr are Very Blest with great cooks!
Some of their responses to things are exactly why the American revolution had to happen. Less cheese? No such thing in any context. Cornbread sucks?!
Have warm cornbread with butter and honey. It’s delicious.
The corn bread doesn't have sugar😢😢
Should have made maple butter corn bread.
“Oh you want it to be more bland” 😂
These kids would love my father’s recipes
When I was stationed there I made some fajitas for some friends. They loved them!
I love how you say they’re highschoolers when they’re like 7th graders lol, in America they’d be middle schoolers (6-8 grade)  also they all ate the cornbread wrong!! you need to put butter and honey on it!
They did the corn bread wrong you put some butter on it while it’s warm and then drizzle honey on top of the butter and corn bread and chow down
I love watching this. Lol
“I’m not comprehending the flavors” Was probably my favorite compliment they gave to the food.  Couldn’t help but smile hearing how beautifully they described their experience. Food really does bring us all together 😊
Why are they so professional
Every word out these people's mouths make me reconsider ever thinking of moving to the uk. Dunno if id survive the blandness
Some of those kids are HIGH SCHOOLERSS!!??  Edit: nvm
This is what the founding fathers fought for. The right to barbecue! 🇺🇲🧑‍🍳🦬🐂🐖🥩🍗🫕
The growth spurt on the twins is crazy
These kids are so funny and delightful- the head master has such a great personality- just love them all!! Thank you for sharing these reactions and food from the USA xo
I was trying to figure out why they were putting the beans on the bread, forgetting beans and toast is a big British thing.
It seems like American BBQ beat Korean BBQ just based off reactions alone. ❤
Airrack???
I absolutely love the life changing moment of them trying American food lol
Going from the blandest cuisine in the world to bbq must have been a spiritual event for those kids.
I wonder how the meat sweats went…
12:52 Have you not eaten in a week😂 i cant they are so funny
THATS MY DANN STATE❤
7:47 cornbread + pasta with sauce and ground beef changed my life
Is that brad pitt? 😮
100% cornbread with butter is 1000 times better than just plain, idk if thats just me or not
Texas barbeque is overrated, except the brisket. Their style of barbeque (dry, smoked, relies on less sauce and more seasonings) works perfectly for brisket but terribly for drier meats like turkey or chicken. Ribs are hit or miss depending on location. I prefer SC style kr midwest style barbeque
Yummy brisket
I love the UK, our Brothers and Sisters from across the pond... They owned the worlds spice trade with companies like East India yet being excited tasting all the wonderful flavors in American food 😂😂😂
Nah I need to know who made the cornbread and how they made it cause ain’t no way they should be underwhelmed like that
8:27 heck of a comment coming from Ollie😂
the people who didn't like the cornbread need some cornbread made with honey. that can make a world of difference, speaking from experience.
As a Texan, agreed. Cornbread is horrible
The country that conquered the world and only knows about spice and cooking now.
that two year 7！！！
Without FBA (Foundational Black Americans) Americas food would taste exactly like that nasty food in Britain. Don’t laugh too hard, you’re welcome!😂❤
Texan here and I react the same way they do every time I eat brisket. It’s just that good.
And then a whole generation of students from one school in England moves to Houston. The End.
Why do you two like school boys so much?  It's a little bit off-putting.
the graduation music is frying me 😭
they need honey butter with the corn bread
These kids are adorable @jolly I grew up in Texas. This food is my grub!
The great thing about legit Southern BBQ is that warm feeling like a food hug happens every time you eat it.
Harry is soo adorable 😍
Too be fair im from texas and despise bread crumbs on my mac and cheese
Harry is one lovely kid
The little dude who keeps throwing his head back in amazement is so relatable.
Not so hard to understand why we are so fat now huh?
Harry and the Headmaster are the MVP here
13:52 I think the kid that doesn’t like the cornbread would like it if it was jiffy because that cornbread is much sweeter
The reason Americans are more likely to be obese is because our food is so good 😔
11:35 my favorite Mac an cheese is the spicy white BBQ Mac and Cheese
Lmao the south sends our regards 😂
vegetarians punchin the air rn
OkAy but cornbread isnt supposed to be eaten by itself. Like you dip it in the meat juices then some pieces of meat and if ur crazy go ahead and put some sides on it. But if u just want the cornbread taking a small swig of water helps sm with texture and flavor somehow. U kinda turn it back into a dough LOL. Is there a reason u guys dont eat with them? Like how hot ones or any other eating show like this does?
I feel bad they are gonna go form the top to the bottom of seasonings
I’m from Texas and this made me so happy
i wish america wasn’t so corrupt i love the concept of our country
You gotta spread some butter on the cornbread. It adds flavor and moisture and enhances the taste so much
I love watching ppl eat American BBQ for the first time.
Southern BBQ is truly the king of American food.
I live in texas and I grew up with my grandparents making bbq for every holiday we get together. Its SO good and now that's all I'm craving after I just ate lol
They would have liked sweet corn bread. Its called that because it is made from sweet corn
Missed the honey for the cornbread
As a Texan, this makes me feel good.
We make big portions and lots of food because leftovers are almost a literal core of our society. We either store it in our fridges, or we *_store it_* in our bellies
i prefer cornbread with the corn in it, i feel like some if them mightve liked it better
you fucked up that cornbread is what you did
You need butter and honey for the corn bread or is that a Florida thing!
I want brisket now
Cornbread is goated so they mustve had the dry kind that feels like sand in your mouth
as a european, i must say texan bbq looks like it might be the greatest thing to ever come out of america right along hard blues and acid 😂
4:18 His wife never made him feel this good. 😂
Y’all gotta eat cornbread the CP way! Spread some butter on it and drizzle honey!!
Im a chef and i always say that food is the true uniter
The best cornbread isn’t dry at all. It’s fluffy and moist like a cake and just slightly sweet. Then you add honey butter.
No banana pudding?
11:32 the British mind cannot handle the flavors of America
As a southerner there is nothing better than a home cooked bbq ESPECIALLY brisket and ribs. I am so happy these kids enjoy it
i mean, if I lived in Britain where all food it either colorless or desaturated, I'd act like this when eating this type of food for the first time, too.
Someone get Tom Holland on this
Id love to see their reactions to back strap! (Venison) And fried pickles!!
Dude giving British people genuine southern bbq is like giving cave men fire 😭
having watched a number of these videos, I'm wondering when they do actual school, or is this just all they do is sit around and eat american food?
You guys need to take the headmaster to texas
Why does no one cook BBQ in England 🤷‍♀️ open a restaurant
he looks like young brad pit version...
Those kids are going to need a nap after all that BBQ. Texas BBQ in a white shirt? Risky.
why the freak do they have graduation music in here😭
You need honey butter with cornbread.
That cornbread looked dry. I'll bless you all with the best cornbread recipe. Get a 9x9 pan and put a sick of butter in it and put it in a 425 degree oven to melt. While the butter is melting mix 2 cups Martha White self rising cornmeal, 1 beaten egg, 1 1/3 cups of milk or buttermilk and a healthy dollop of sour cream or mayonnaise. Take the pan out of the oven when the butter is melted and pour it in with the cornmeal mix and mix it up good. Then pour back into the pan and back in the oven for about 25 min or until golden brown. You're welcome.
Do seafood boil
In Pittsburgh, Pa, a sandwich like the Texas fold would not be complete without the fries or what the British call chips.   I.E. the almost famous Primanty's  sandwich. Ps. Not sure that I got the spelling of the restaurant's name correct
That "it's lovely" said it all 😂
I agree that cornbread isn't really that good (it can be but not for me), but where it's really at is corn casserole.
Watching these boys eat a good smoked brisket made my day
How do they get the food to the UK so fresh?
1) needs to be sweet cornbread 2) I love me some Mac and cheese but they are right. Keep the breadcrumbs off
I never knew it was called a Texas fold. I always do that with my barbecue and I’m from California. 😅
Im moving to the UK and opening a bbq shop.
just a heads up from a tech support person; if you have AT&T; Saily won't work on your phone because of carrier locks
I LOVE THE LITTLE KID’S VOICE IT IS SO CUTE ANS SATUSFYINGLY BRITISH 😭
wait why arent brit kids eating pickles??? is it not a huge thing over there?
I’m sad they didn’t try more sauces!
Brits arent use to so much flavor
It’s so funny to see them treat southern BBQ like a classy dish by calling it “Lovely” and “nice” it’s hilarious
To make cornbread right you need Jiffy, frozen corn And jalapenos chopped; mix it all and add 3-5 mins to the Jiffy bake time.
My uncle got a smoker, so during holidays, especially Mother’s day he breaks it out and spends the whole day smoking food for us to eat. Some of the most amazing food I’ve eaten, really just melts in the mouth. I am getting hungry just thinking about it
They were knocked out for the rest of the day. 😴 😂😂😅😅
Idk why but watching foreigners enjoy America food and for once saying positive things about America is very refreshing and nice to hear and see
Delicious 😋
From TX! My husband smokes brisket and tri-tip once a week. Our kids are 6 and 4 and are huge meat eaters! They can eat just a plate full red meat any day.
God these poor children. Thank you for introducing them to the concept of flavor
I encourage british to come to the american southern so you can eat good. I dont blame you if you dont want to come now cus of trump..plan ah trip after the orange monster is gone
Now this is real eating
Let’s just be men and agree Texas has the best BBQ.
1:29 what is brad pitt talking about bro
Headmaster has lost a bunch of weights
Dip the cornbread in the BBQ Sauce....
Pickles' "Cucumber, but better." Literally
Bro cornbread is awesome
Next time you do this tell them some crazy ass meat, instead of beef, pork, or chicken. Tell them they're eating bear, raccoon, and rabbit.😂💀
British people never had flavor like this in their entire life
All the people talking about taking the headmaster to Texas and here I am in Hawaii still waiting for Josh and Olly to come try true Hawaiian food and local Hawaiian food (it doesn’t have pineapple in it)
This should be an advert for tourism USA
I get that they loved everything else but why they gotta do the cornbread like that. Everybody knows u gotta serve it with chili and a nice helping of butter to melt in the cornbread. If your eating it with barbecue or something else, then thats alright too, but for a first time experience, u gotta do a really nice chili so that the cornbread soaks up all the important bits
Dang it. As a Texas I love it  But stop giving them good British folks high blood pressure. 😂😂😂😂 How dare they disrespect the cornbread 😂
Make them have like tajin and chamoy and lucas and tamarind or a mangonada
Texan here, this video makes me cry of joy, barbecue here is our priority especially for what we are known for
I see now why us people are fat
I hope they didn't have class or anything after this cause they all would have k.o
Legend has it that they are still napping from this episode
As an American this makes me proud 😂
This is probably the best episode 💪🏾
These kids are never gonna be the same.
So does someone get flown out to cook this texas style?
"Everyday" with no hesitation says alot lol
Texas Cuisine for the Win❤
These kids are awesome.
They need to put some honey on that cornbread
You need Dr. pepper to wash that all down
The grown dude having the taste experience of his life was so funny 😂😂😂
As a Texan, this was awesome to watch 😂 glad they enjoyed it.
I smiled the entire video lol adorable
Beef hotdogs reign supreme
Vegans should stay away from this video😂😂😂
I'm surprised these privileged brittish runts aren't vaping.   Maybe that explains the counteless edits because the producer prolly was reminding them to NOT FKN VAPE on camera.
The headmaster has got to be the coolest ever…
😂 2:42 kid is already fighting off the itis
This is why Americans are so unhealthy.  We can't help it 😂
Honey Cornbread is top tier. And put warmed butter on it enhances it even further.
Did they say the BARK taste good
Next stop, 4th of July fireworks going off in the middle of London. 😅
Harry’s feeling it. I like him.
The headmaster needs his own show.
Lil homie that kept nodding out finna be a Texas citizen as soon as he can 🤣
I love Harry’s reactions to it he so sweet! When he said “it’s lovely” was precious. Hello from Texas!
Cornbread made fresh daily. If you don't like it, don't show up.
As an (southern) American who has traveled to Britain, I totally understand why our tea would not even be palatable to most Brits. The amount of sugar truly is mind boggling.
Alternative title: British High Schoolers Taste Flavor For The First Time!
You should’ve got them a sweet tea as their drink
Reason number 1 American food is better than British food... Barbecue
telling the south to stop making cornbread is fighting words 😂😂😂
I am sorry but as a German i have to say THAT IS NOT BREAD😅 thats toast. Sry but the german inside me took over
Sweet cornbread is the way to go, especially if you can find it with corn made in it. Same as hush puppies. Hush puppies are good, but even better with corn in it
The best brisket I've ever had is my stepdads. He's not a native Texan he's actually from New Jersey and I 100% prefer his brisket over any other brisket I've had.
Ya'll need to be careful. The south holds grudges and they might be thinking of hitting you all with a UNO reverse card for the war of 1812 JUST to avenge the slander of their cornbread! Lol.
Cornbread needs butter and honey. Try it then.
As a yr7 I can confirm this is what MOST of the boys look like in my skl😅
The kid saying “that’s lovely” every time he eats the brisket is so precious lol he’s in heaven
this is what happens when you live in a place that serves beans on toast as a meal. they are experiencing real food.
When i go to the UK I have the polar opposite experience of these kids haha
Im from texas, but ive only had texas bbq a few times.
"The flavor lasts for ages" oh trust me, in 2 hours when you have smokey burps youre really going to be saying that 😂
Do these kids not have the internet?
As a native houstonian I approve this message! But Ive never referred to it as a Texas foldie. Just a fold over my boy. Beans on toast innit gov. Is that a saying Ive heard somewhere
I love the reaction to southern sweet tea 13:24
You know, I dont often watch this channel, but almost every time I do, I think, ah, the people who show why Americans are so fat. We. Just. Can't. Stop. It's too good.
Omg NOOOO THE MESSED UP THE CORNBREAD?!
I love watching these sweet boys enjoy our southern food. And just a tip, not all cornbread is dry and flavorless. You should try it again in America when you come visit us.
Came to the comments section ready to speak the truth. My fellow Americans have already proclaimed it but I must reiterate. BUTTER THE CORNBREAD.
Omg Mr. Smith looks so lean and younger!!
I am from Texas and i dont like BBQ, cornbread, or beans or eat pork but i love other nations trying it and understanding why Americans love it. For the record, i love buffalo wings 100x more. Jolly, please visit Wingbucket in Downtown Dallas. Try a the variety of large portion wings, and definitely try the PBJ wings (by themselves) and sour cream onion fries with ranch.
Correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t real, Southern cornbread actually have bits of corn in it still?
Funny watching british people eating all this American food as an American whose never had it despite living in texas my entire life
Why Brisket though, it's so mid compared to pork BBQ. Beef should not be smoked, there's a million other ways to cook it that don't ruin it. Any cut of smoked pork on the other hand is divine.
Mouth watering
Thank you for sharing our culture as a 4 generation Texas rancher my life is beef and bbq is one of my favorite things about my culture great video
Very disappointed at the Mac and cornbread. I can make it better lol. Oh and the little ones should of had an Arnold Palmer or a lemonade to drink
Teenage boys don’t care. They will eat anything. lol.
When I go to the untied kingdom I’ll make sure to bring cornbread
These are always my favorite videos.
All you guys do is make food videos now…
These guys are so real and adorable I just love them
I feel the same way about cornbread....big ol meh
you need butter for the cornbread
Love seeing they’re eyes 👀 pop once they taste it!
Lmfao I remember living in Cambridge and making greens for my friends and they were shocked 😂
hellaurrr baby British Brad pitt
Looks like I'm ordering BBQ tonight!
us texans put heart and soul into our bbq
Baby boy! 🤣 What needed to happen was the corn bread warmed. Cut n half depth wise and then add butter and a little white sugar. Then eat it. Lol I'm n the south and that's how I do to. It's lovely 💖. Otherwise I don't like corn bread either 😂. I love your honestly. Try again and do another video.
Those pork ribs looked dry as hell.
Next experience after this is going to be meat sweats 😂
The headmaster is having the day of his life! Lol
You should re title the video “British people try seasoning for the first time”
I Love Brisket... ESPECIALLY from TEXAS..  IT'S THE BEST!!!!
Love these lads and their headmaster.
Why is that “sweet tea” so bright did yall use the right tea bags?
I think I've eaten the best cornbread in Virginia near Monticello where Thomas Jefferson had hie estate. I think the place is called Michie Tavern. That cornbread was so fking good man
As a Texan I grinned from ear to ear throughout this whole video. Nicely done.
Y’all just haven’t had the right cornbread! And it needs some good  honey butter on it!
“The skin is really hard to bite through” That’s because it’s not skin it’s a casing. As a southerner hearing foreigners complementing  our BBQ makes me glad
Corn bread needs butter my friends 😉
As a Texan myself, I can say that everyone makes their cornbread differently. My momma taught how to cornbread, but she'd call it "Cakebread" since it takes just as good as cake.  And she'd always make it with Seasoned meatloaf and peas
THIS is why we are so fat 😂😂 too much GOOD ASS FOOD
Makes you appreciate USA foods.
man i would love to try brisket i have never had it before  looks so amazing
At this point just go to a random town or city and pick a random restaurant and it’ll be better than British food
Funny fact about "British" "baked beans" the ones in the can by Heinz, are American in origin but rarely sell here the blatant false advertising might have something to do with it, you see Heinz baked beans have never even for a second been baked.
glad they enjoyed real food
I love that one kids expression every time he taste something different like WOW a new flavor unlocked
Harry reminds me of a British Goob from Meet the Robinson's and I am all for it 👏
You NEED to try jimmy johns
Sublime, Mesmorized, and Lovely!!! - yes to all of them lol
This is why we’re all fat here in Texas.
I bet my cornbread would win over those kids!
Sometimes, you forget what you have until you see others enjoying it. I'll definitely get some bbq when I get back home in Austin.
I've been craving some texas bbq for a while, where did you guys get this bbq from?
This highschool ??
Another fellow Texan commenting here. One of my life philosophies is that you can turn anything into a sandwich or a taco. Words to live by.
Now, they may understand why  we are bigger than the average human.
My Texan ego just got boosted.
The UK confuses me you have half the people saying our food is bland and boring then you have these guys that just love it to death
if the auntie has big arms her cornbread you can trust 😊
Funny part is they are probably tasting some of the worst BBQ not from Texas smoke ring tells me all i need to know 🤣🤣🤣 and they love it so imagine if they tried real Texas BBQ
British people that’s flavour 😂
They really need good cornbread because not all bbq places makes good cornbread.
Texas barbecue is only described in positive adjectives and mouthwatering mutterings straight from the stomach😂
Channel going down so it's time to milk the school kids again...
The principle is ALWAYS the best!
As an Arizonan I'm offended by what they said about Texas corn bread😂
That headmaster is just getting an out-of-body experience in every bite🤣🤣
"I don't even think i can eat food here anymore..." 😶.  Now you get it!! 🩷😛 We love our bbq!!
They should try Santa Maria bbq
2:10 wth is that in the plate
I don't like cornbread either 😂
Britis people and they eat something that’s not beans on toast for the first time
“Sublime.” Love it. Love from San Antonio, Texas
I fee so patriotic now
As a Texan: I love watching people experience our food for the first time! Absolutely the best thing we’ve contributed to the world
I'm so happy they like it. But I wish they has the proper Mac & cheese. that was white washed mac
Dont worry boys, as a Georgia girl - and we have really good BBQ here- even I am dumbfounded by how good Texas BBQ is!!!
u gotta throw some maple syrup on that cornbread, as a nebraskan the corn state, trust me on that
As a Texan, I loved this, I love seeing others love our food, I just wish you gave them a bit of baby rays honey bbq sause with it.
That is a tiny brisket!
Medieval peasant tries Dorito
Put some honey in that cornbread!
This channel alwase finds a way to make me hungry
No way these giants are 9years old
I was raised in Houston Texas and I love bbq but I HATE cornbread
The 2 blonds could easily pass as Americans if you gave them a hoodie, jean shorts & a baseball cap
How much this kids have changed  in a year!!!! 😮😅
Maybe the cornbread wasn’t sweet enough…
Poor poor bastards 😂😂😂...enjoy y'all
3:43 THE VOICE DIFFERENCE OMG
Tyler durden
This is a wonderful video. Thanks for posting this. In Linton Indiana, on the 4TH of July we will have our annual Ham and Egg Breakfast. Our hams are cooked in the old Hawaiian style and are buried underground for 12 hours. The meat falls from the bone. This year we will do so with heavy hearts. 5 weeks ago an EF2 tornado struck us. I hope that you will experience this one day . Not the tornado but the food. You should also invite Mister Headmaster Smith.
The cornbread dis is savage
You didn't give them some sweet cream butter for the cornbread?
There’s different kinds of cornbread my momma makes it like a desert so I can’t eat normal cornbread cause of it 😂
Nah man them pit beans are the best
7:58 that must be horrible cornbread
As a Texan I love watching this and seeing them love it because smoked meat is in the food pyramid in Texas 😅
As a American yes yes we sneak beef into everything even beef
Please bring them to America 😭
3:44 “you’ve brought pickles again?!” do they really not have pickles over there?? poor kid omfg 😭
As a Texan cornbread is hit or miss. Sweet cornbread is good if you don’t make it dry. But the best cornbread is sweet & has jalapeño. (Also don’t make it dry)
I agree with them, it does look lovely, and it IS lovely 😍
10:18  🤨
The kid that didn’t like cornbread broke my heart 😂
I love watching the kids and the Head Master enjoy some yummy American food!! ❤
Honey cornbread
Meat fucked up with sugar
One young man (i think his name was matt) ate like a true Texan!!! He downed ALL of it 😮😮❤❤❤❤🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a Texan, this makes me Happy!! congratulations lads, you’re now the New Man of the house once you get home
Hubiera sido buena idea que el profesor estuviera acompañado con otra persona. Hermoso programa, me gustó muchisimo
This is the best episode yet
That one kid that keeps saying "that's lovely" got me laughing 😂
Now these kids are going to go home and nothing's ever going to taste good or right again
9:41 😂 everyday
5:06 😂 he came for business
I grew up in Kentucky and never liked cornbread. I had an ex-girlfriend who made some for a meal she cooked for us once and it changed my opinion entirely. It turns out the cornmeal was the problem, for me at least. She used Buttermilk cornmeal and it completely changed the flavor and texture.
not my american ass smiling throughout this video
Bout get brisket withdraws 💀
First time they didn’t have biscuits and tea
I love the teacher 😂
This was a nice surprise. Glad these young boys liked it!
new kids to make money of. i love it
I don't think I can eat food here anymore lmao he was so fr too
That mac and cheese didn't look good
These kids never touching another school lunch 😭
As a chef this is incredible. Love the pure joy bbq brings
The headmaster really deserves this 😩
These kids are so adorable! Its really beautiful to see other people try food from different cultures. That headmaster is really something else, someone bring him to America to try more BBQ!! ❤❤
I love how some kids are picky but the principal loves everything
you must not have put enough sugar in that cornbread. lol
Next time time give them sweet cornbread with jalapeños in it.
After eating this can i have a "bowol owf wa ah "? 👍🇧🇩
Yall f'ed up the CORNBREAD?!?!!
When they put the beans on the breadddd😭 noooo
No southerners will ever stop making cornbread lol
As an American, I agree with the blonde boy. Cornbread is so gross. Love BBQ though.
Poopy
Cuteness overload    these will never get old
i never thought that people saying brits would be overwhelmed with flavor if they tried our food would be true til i watched ts😭
like we can't even ignore how hungry the principle is in each video... but respect the man he's the funniest in the in the pack
Just binged every video in the series and man the headmaster is so cool.
Can't beat brisket.
Y'all need to up your cornbread game it seems. No one would ever call the cornbread we make bland
Love keeping up with all of yalls video's, Need to let these kids try american fair desserts like funnel cakes and deep fried oreo's and such.
"slawRrr"
I love to see you guys try sides (Sidemen fast food chain)
1:18 Mack looks like Brad Pitt!
Get them to try Maryland style blue crab
Have them try American Candy. I recommend the baby bottle pop. Specifically the blue raspberry flavor
I'm going to move to the UK and open up a Texas BBQ joint. Slow smoked brisket, homemade biscuits, the works. I'd probably have a queue from open to close every day.
You should gotten them sweet cornbread. That one kid would l8ke it i think.
100% with the kids that didn't like the breadcrumbs on the mac and cheese.
At 8:22 that analogy is actually the smartest comparison I’ve heard and that’s coming from a states teacher
Here from across the pond. Makes me happy to see these kids tear up that texas bbq
Jolly, you owe these kids a field trip.
“You the funny one” 😂
I’m from texes and I love the boys reaction
Brits experience actual cooking for the first time
How do they get the food to them fresh if it was made in America fast food wise
Man, now I want barbecue
I'm from Texas do our bbq is the best. But have them try Panda Express or Mexican food
The taste of freedom
All the Texans are talking about how patriotic this video makes them and im like, Damn, im Canadian and even im feeling patriotic for Texas
I grew up with a very mixed culture my dad was adopted from south korea and was full korean adopted with his two younger sisters by an a American man my grandfather and a half Australian half British woman my grandmother who was first married to an Australian man and had three kids my Aunt and my two uncles who are 75% Australian and 25% British so ive picked up on British and Australia words and sayings it drives my gf nuts cause i will use British or Australian terms instead of American terms my dad and his sisters lost all of there korean language skills since they were afopted under the age of 7 so i dont know any korean but im also the only one of the grandkids on my dads side that can understand my Aunt who is British and Australian because ive spent the most time with her i hope you see my comment i love your guys channel as well as the Korean Englishman and i love juno and Julie there both so adorable
They didn’t get the right corn bread 😂😂
Their eyes tell the whole story.
the blatant racism in this video. why are the black kid and white kids separate. its gross to see. why in today's society do we have to separate them? do you not think this video would be better if we got all their opinions at once?
i love these guys but i lowkey miss the old highschoolers idk why 😭
Being a Texan i cant believe they have never tried BBQ before wtf lmaoo
I swear this highschool is the luckiest highschool in all of England
I think the comment that hits the hardest is when one of them said that they "I don't think I can eat food here anymore."
Weather the bbq be from Texas, North Carolina or KC, America does BBQ right and that’s the truth. Sure we have our rivalry’s within our own country for best ever, but watching this is like watching why our ancestors fought so hard for this country. Watching the people we gained independence from, praise our food like they’ve never eaten before. This brings me so much pride to be an American! 🫡🇺🇸
This is addorable. Thinking that you've only tried one region of the us food
The kids immediately putting their beans on “toast” 😂 No wonder some of them didn’t like it with all that bread in the way…American beans are a standalone!
Sometimes I wonder how people’s stomachs can handle all this food when they are taste testing like this. By the time ya’ll get to the beef sausage, I know I would be feeling sick by then.
Literally looks way too dry for an actual Teaxas BBQ.
As a southerner, I don’t particularly like corn bread but I use corn bread mix to make other things like fried green tomatoes. Also, you should have included a classic tomato sandwich on white bread with mayo and salt and pepper
I can see the happines
"you're the funny one" gave me mobster vibes
So, are we going to start seeing commercials in the U.S. featuring hungry looking kids who have  never had BBQ while a well spoken narrator is asking all americans to donate to a charity that will feed them BBQ for just 73 cents a day for one child to eat BBQ everyday?
I love the videos with these kids and I sometimes show them to my Engludh language students here in Italy. However, I really liked Max and Theo, what happened to them?
Harry Year 7 looks like young Goob from Meet the Robinsons movie
Put butter or honey on the cornbread
Who's going to tell them you dont have to use a knife and fork lol. This was cute, I luv when they say thats nice.
“Everything is better with bread, innit?” Amen
We need to give those boys the good cornbread with honey butter and fresh out the oven, even the ones with corn in them.
Bruh the cornbread slander is a fade on sight
you can easily spot the difference between the taste preferences of the kids and the headmaster😂
As a person who enjoys a feeding folks, this just warms my heart😊
American food has by far the worst marketing, because most of the world when they hear American food they think of fast food and junk food. But this is what American cuisine should be known for.
To be fair to pickle in milkshake. Dipping things in ice cream and milkshakes is common
I feel so ashamed that the one time i visited Austin, Texas i did not have any barbecue. 😭 I was there for like 5 days, too.
they’re eating this Texas BBQ like they haven’t ever eaten good food before 😂 oh my.
Brit kids are thinking: this is why Americans so fat but so happy!
Baked beans have their origins in precolonial New England. White beans (usually navy beans or great northern beans) were slow baked with maple sugar, mustard and/or spices, and a strip of fatty bear meat. The fatty bear meat was eventually replaced with salt pork. In the early part of the last century, Pittsburgh's H.J. Heinz Company decided to market its beans in the UK and began manufacturing them there, at some point the sauce was changed to a tomato based sauce (because much of their other products contained tomato), similar to SpaghettiOs or Chef Boyardee canned pasta. It's not uncommon for people in the Northeastern United States and Maritime Canada to make their own baked beans for holidays, etc. It's an all day affair, but the end result is usually well worth it.
The big thing with cornbread is the recipe. It changes from place to place drastically and some have it super bland, some make it with chunks of corn in it and it's much more flavorful. All depends on who's making it
Other countries finding out why Americans love to eat!
Usually you put butter on Cornbread to make it have more flavor. I’ve never eaten cornbread plain in my life!
Needed som honey or butter for that cornbread
They should try Louisiana food
As a life long Texan I've never that called a Texas fold. Of course as a Hispanic we eat our BBQ with tortillas not bread
I need a behind the scenes of how they get this food to them. Imported?
a lot of people are saying that your first time having bbq is a life changing experience, but to be honest, every time i have good bbq it’s a life changing experience 😭 can’t wait to change it again
Jolly you guy's need to bring the Headmaster and the kids to Texas for BBQ. My little brother moved t Huntsville and I'd fly tere just to meet you all. Love watching you all. Much love from Yucaipa, California.😂
Now they know why everyone is bigger in Texas 🫣 🤭 🤣
Those poor, deprived children
Boys adorable and Dave looks great! Enjoy Portugal!
We don’t put beans on toast you eat it with the food!
You are supposed to eat the cornbread with the food the food! In Alabama we skip the white bread not necessarily
They’re so lucky I want that so bad
The way they all automatically put the beans on the bread threw me for a loop😭😭 like I can't believe they all actually do that
I hope this was at the end of the day.  The meat sweats they'd have after this wouldn't be conducive to learning a single thing.  Also, as a southerner, I wholeheartedly agree with the mac and cheese criticism.  Bread crumbs and burnt cheese ruins an otherwise exceptional mac and cheese.
Butter keeps the cornbread together.
I love watching these kind of things because it reminds me that here in America it isn’t all bad as everyone says
Now we just need a granny to remake that cornbread for them
How did you get the food back to the UK?  Glad they all loved it!
lol someone get that grade 7 boy on the left bouta pass out from the flavor!
4:39 that boy kinda remind me of Goob in Meet the Robinson's
Have you ever eaten paper i have, and i will not hear this corn bread slander? You didn't evan eat it right. You need butter or some kind of chilies or something of equivalents to dip it in
Please tell me you gave them time to take a fat nap afterwards 😂 Can’t have all that rich food and expect them to get through the rest of the day 😂
I told my bread like that. I'm not from Texas 👀. MOF, I'm not American.
These videos always make me happy.  To see other people enjoying different foods for the first time :)
These types of videos make me feel bipolar 😂 I'm having a happy craves.
Love it 😂😂😂😂
Ruined these Kids pallet ... infused with Flavors Galore
10:45 “I don’t even think I can eat food here anymore” 😩🤣🤙 kid caught a taste of that bald eagle 🦅
Anything from Texas would be better then what they offer😮
Ok guys, take your corn bread, slice it in half, fry it in bacon grease or butter  and cover it in syrup or honey. I think you'll like it better
Europeans should try to make their own BBQ, don't think you can only eat smoked brisket here in America, try to make it yourselves, your missing out on the best meat ever. 👍🥩 🤠.
They had the sweet, cakey cornbread. I grew up with the coarse version made with bacon fat. A different animal entirely. I don't consider midwest cornbread to be the real item.
My husband is from South Texas, where we currently live, and I am an Ohioan heathen and I don't mess around with open face sandwiches. 2 slices of bread or splitting open a roll!
Oh ny lord that one kid when he tasted the brisket ... its like the brisket spirit entered his soul. 😅
I don’t think that cornbread was made very well. My grandma‘s cornbread was awesome that cornbread does look too much like cake.
Sweet cornbread is better
Has someone warned them about the meat sweats?
Cornbread is a personal favorite but I like mine in a dutch oven lined with bacon and more corn than cake and eaten with good beans.
Crazy to give them a hunk of dry cornbread. Not even butter? Thats a clear oversight.
The best beans you will eat will be at someones home.
I love seeing these boys grow up!!!
They need to feed them some Crawfish, Jambalaya, Gumbo, and E'touffe. Maybe some blue crab....and the finest red beans and rice blue runner can make
There’s no way that first kid on the right in 9
The south will not take kindly to the cornbread comment 😂 to be fair, that stuff was clearly from a box. Get some southern grandma to make it. It'll change your life.
They aint give em the right corn bread
As a native Texan, shouts out for rockin’ the Mammoth hoodie!
The kids are a mix of yes or no to the flavors.. the teacher is just in 7th heaven.
It’s not supposed to be a goddamn cup of tea!!! It’s iced tea!
"Oh I love beans" sounded so pure hahahahahh
Dam i hate waiting for brisket to cook because it’s just testing your patience by giving you an amazing smell for 16 hours knowing what glorious taste and texture your gonna get
There is no way Mack in 9. Kid looks like Brad Pitt in fight club.
Hot cornbread with butter is soooo much better
How is no one talking about the last one that was hilariously.
They probably went to sleep for a week after eating all this food 😂 love it
I love their reactions to Southern BBQ. I'd advise avoiding the bbq in the Carolinas and their vinegar sauces.   It hurts my heart that they didn't like the cornbread. Maybe it was overcooked?! Lol
You know what is funny in areal unflattering way ?  These kids didn't ask where Texas was but I betcha 80% of Americans have no idea where this school is located.  I  know this because my young neighbor thinks Connecticut is a European country.   Thumbs up BTW.
That plate they got was probably like 50 dollars or more worth of bbq. So good, but definitely not beans on toast
A little surprised that they loved the Brisket and Ribs because they have SOOOO much flavour and every Brit I've met, really do eat a pretty bland diet. **NOT an insult, just a fact** 😊
I'm not a huge fan of cornbread either. Not that it's bad cus it's not. It's just alright. I will say giving it to them after having all the BBQ is a bit of a disservice to the cornbread. It can't live up to what they ate before. It is pretty nice with a tiny drizzle of honey. I've been known to break it up into a bowl and put some sugar and pour milk on it. It's quite good that way.
You can actually hear the song starting to play in their heads "The european mind is ignorant and blind to the beauty of the USA, at the Circle K"
That’s lovely OMNOMNOMNOM
These kids will be in the streets yelling "The British are coming!" And causing a revolution if you keep giving them our food lol
My husband used to think restaurants were good, but now he's so spoiled with home cooking that he complains about the food not being good.  I would love to spoil some brits, love how they love our dishes❤.
The headmaster is Grade A.  I find myself so happy for him.
When he said biting into the brisket was like eating a pillow or something comfy that’s why we call it soul food
I love how they're just getting stuck in with their hands.
The cornbread needs to be warm and drizzle honey atop
❤🤍💙
Americans LOVE our BBQ, glad yall enjoyed it!
🫡🫡🫡🫡🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🇺🇸🇺🇸😢😢😢😢😢🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
If you become an American. You’re given free BBQ, an AR-15, and a pickup truck.
I really believe that Headmaster is the biggest kid of them all!
british people experiencing flavor for the first time
Bring the head master to the U.S.A
As an old Texas gal this made me giggle quite a bit Texas is known for our BBQ. You should’ve had the young men put the barbecue beans on the cornbread. They might have loved it like that.  I’m glad they enjoyed all of our delicacies. I wish you had given them a try of our collard greens
Immediately put beans on bread!
I have a feeling most of this wasent warm either, which is a darn shame.  Warm cornbread with a bit of butter is heaven
These are little diplomats on their first tour of the U.S. 😂😂😂
As a born and raised Texan, this whole video made my heart smile…y’all are Awesome!! Much love from Texas!!
As someone from the south that  grew up with country cookin'. Yeah I don't like corn bread either. Family thinks I'm crazy.
Well there are 2 versions of cornbread; one is sweet like a cake the other is less sweet or more like bread in general
Minnesota foods would really throw them for a lupe
Try putting butter on a slice of cornbread while still warm so it melts into the cornbread bread, or if the cornbread is cooled down, I always stick it in the microwave for 10 seconds with the butter on it, to melt it in, 👍🙂👍
that one kid pisses me tf off
The headmaster is the luckiest man on this channel. He alwats have a taste of whatever the kids are having 😂😂
I can agree with a lot of people, corn bread was just never a me thing, it's kinda bland and it crumbles to easily. Everyone around me loves it though
That’s the one downside to living on the North East Coast. You can’t find any decent BBQ 😭🍖…
You need to serve the corn bread with butter and honey 7:41
Ahhh thats lovely!!!😅
The cornbread comment hurt my heart at the end
Watching these is so enjoyable, and I don’t know why.
Everytime they say "I want to go to America" i say "No you do not". We do have great food though "not fast food"
A nice melty butter on the corn bread is delicious.
And now, you get to go home and eat your mom’s garbage until you are able to immigrate to the USA!!! Good luck.
a seven year old is in highschool
Automatically putting the beans on the bread is hilarious 😂❤
I’ve always wanted to know how yall get them the food fresh lol
GET THEM SOME REAL CORNBREAD!!!!!!!
Bring these boys to Texas and have them try the top 10 joints in Houston. Then go to Dallas and Austin and have em try that
The kid who put pickles in his milkshake is an icon
This made me hungry
Get them some real corn bread!!!!
Brits discover seasoning
Meanwhile, here in Britain: oi guv, drop the meat in boiling wa'er and serve with slop - lovely
Im a Texan born and raised and I havent ever heard of a Texas fold sandwich. I dont like coleslaw so I wouldnt try it. Haha  Ya gotta have butter in the cornbread.
oooo...youngin' hatin' on the baked beans!!!! LOL!!!! well, not everybody can make good baked beans so....🤷🏾‍♂️😂
Im a Texan born and raised and I havent ever heard of a Texas fold sandwich. I dont like coleslaw so I wouldnt try it. Haha  Ya gotta have butter in the cornbread.
It's so cool to watch people from around the world enjoy our Texas BBQ, makes me proud to be a Texan 😂
Im a Texan born and raised and I havent ever heard of a Texas fold sandwich. I dont like coleslaw so I wouldnt try it. Haha
Their high schoolers are so tiny. Makes all American high schooler boys look like linebackers.
Awesome video guys! So glad to see the kids and the principal? I am assuming? loving our food.
Should explain the difference in BBQ according to states…. Memphis, Kansas City, Texas, Alabama, Nashville hot,
I’m an American in the South (Tennessee) and you guys are making me hungry
Where did you get the food from.. sincerely a hungry londoner
9:05 *dude on the right just eyes closed enjoying the moment with his ribs bahahaha*
Little "Never make cornbread again" dude, howdy from Texas, and I shall make crunchy-crusty cornbread in a cast iron skillet EVERY day in honor of you.  (Butter and honey on hot cornbread, mmmm. Or eaten with a nice, hot bowl of chili!)
They’re gonna be chasing that flavor for the rest of their lives
You need butter on the cornbread.
The world hates our government as much as we do, but our food is unsurpassed.
Harry's reaction is the same as mine every time I have the BBQ, how can you not?
Hard to believe those two are seven year olds.
US barbecue is regional.  I’m in Northern California and have never had brisket barbecued at any home.  You have to order brisket ahead of time here, but we barbecue TRI-tip instead.  It’s just regional.
BBQ in Texas is our true state treasure! Sharing it with others is one of our favorite things to do. ❤
The bark is the best part! From now on, I shall call the crust "the bark." This Texas girl thinks y'all are darling!
Cornbread @Jolly needs to be eaten with butter and syrup. We save it for a dessert.
They should’ve had some southern blk grandma make the cornbread. We add evaporated milk, sugar and a pinch of cinnamon. We then slap some whipped honey butter on it. They would’ve went into a catatonic state. 😂
Barbecue is a category of soul food; it's quite literally the soul of a region. And in America, there are many different renditions of barbecue. Southwest has beef, Coastal US has seafood, Louisiana has a full spectrum all its own, my native region (the South-East) has chicken and pork. The list goes on. Each region would go to war over whose is best, if it weren't for the fact that barbecue is mainly about bringing people together and making them feel at home.
He’s definitely not “the funny one”.
It's hard to go back once you've had that southern BBQ boo
You're welcome from Texas.
Yaaaay. A new series!
Bro, you guys gotta try Kansas City barbecue, go to Arthur Bryants in downtown Kansas City is the most ghetto area of Kansas, but if the original Arthur Bryant’s it’s cheap as hell and it’s fucking amazing, the sauce isn’t for everybody because it’s very vinegary but I fucking love it. You also got Oklahoma Joe’s/KC ,Jack Stack, Gates, burnt end BBQ and a whole bunch of other hole in the walls that are great, if it’s not one of the names I listed or a hole in the wall it’s gonna be ass, but Kansas City’s got so much good barbecue Texas might have better meats, but our sauce is the best in the world
Now you have to work the rest of the south for the variations of BBQ / pulled pork and an array of sauces based on state or region.
Those young men are amazing! 😂 Had me giggling through the whole episode!
How can they not duplicate bbq there?! And so curious where they got the food from if it’s not common there.
so when are you going to take Mr. Z to try TX bbq?
Notice how some of their reactions were exactly the same as Josh and Ollie’s when they first tried it? “How am I going to eat anything else ever again?”
I love these kids
West Texan here,and we love our brisket fat and cabrito!
That kid went home to his parents saying "we need to go tj america now! Do you understand!?"
watching them put the beans on the bread, Dishonor to the beans.....Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow.......
As a European living in Houston, I can tell that Texas BBQ is a real life changing experience. I had the same reaction at the first time. I've traveled half of the world, but the  stakes, ribs and briskets are just simple superior here.
Kid that doesnt like cornbread can pound sand... LOL wtf bro!? I kid, but...WTF BRO!!!!!!????
I’m from northern Pennsylvania and we call cornbread "Johnny Cake".  I think they might like the cornbread if it was fresh, warm & spread with butter.
Now they know why we’re all so fat 😂
People eating Beans and Toast saying cornbread is bland is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!! LMAOOOOOOOO
I beg u make them try Persian food
Where's the female students? Why are they never in these videos? Y'all should have done sweet corn bread.
Brisket is one of the damn near best things to come out of Jewish culture.
Watching from Texas 😃
Friggin love these dudes.
North Carolina BBQ is SO much better!!!
Love watching the young ones experience American food for the first time. But this puts and even bigger smile on my face. We don’t mess around in TX
We all need a Mr. SMITH comes to America series.  You know we do. And while you are at it, bring along Ollie's Dad!!!
honestly surprised an american hasn’t opened a Texas BBQ spot in england.  it would be so popular lol
I'm surprised none of them choked on that butter-less cornbread.
The way they immediately put the beans on the bread just have me shaking my head like why why are you putting it on bread?
Nah but imagine after this the next morning you see some beans on toast
As a southerner , I just have to say that tea looked a little pale, sweet tea should be much darker than that
1 AMERICAN CORN BREAD IS DRENCCCED IN BUTTER AND HONEY 🍯
That headmaster is worse than the boys.  Too funny!
I want to know the parents' reactions to what the kids eat.
this is why America is obese
13:42 not the music cutting off 😭
Sendem over here let's getter some good ol' south supper
Born and raised in Texas. Never, not one time have I ever heard anyone call that a Texas fold. It's just a BBQ sandwich.  But happy yall enjoyed the meats.
Invite British kids to America!!!!!!
Their Mom's are gonna so angry at them when they get home😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s like cucumber but better lol
Yall ain’t give them sweet cornbread. I make hot honey cornbread ❤
The food looked amazing and they (especially the headmaster) made that look amazing and now they have a clear picture as to why so many Americans are overweight. lol 🤣🤣
Brits getting back to their roots and learning why their forefathers in an effort to get more spices made an empire that never sets.
Dont ask me why but brisket is so much better as a sandwich or on bread then just eating the meat alone 🤷‍♂️
Born and raised in Texas, not on the best day did you pollute BBQ with cold slaw, pickles, etc.  After the damn Yankees started invading Texas after the destroy their state's politically and economically, they also destroyed BBQ.    The think that BBQ is grilling outside.  No idea that it was a slowly smoking  meat to make is moist and tender.
Funny kids
These kids videos are my all time favorite love hearing there opinions on our food. 😂
Idk why it makes me happy seeing British people try real food.
amazing reactions considering it was mediocre version of texas bbq
These kids are gonna be chasing that taste the rest of their lives! 😂
British people tasting bbq: omg what is that tastes sooo amazing!!!! Americans: Seasoning and spices lmao.
I feel like they need to come to American 🇺🇸 like the other group went to Korean.
As someone who lives in Texas, we are absolutely spoiled rotten when it comes to food. Kansas City, Memphis, the Carolinas all have some great BBQ too but it'll never top my home state's offerings for me. This was a great vid, crack on lads! Cheers from Austin Texas 🍖
Those black and brown kids aren't British anymore than my being born in china as a white man makes me chinese.
I'm a southerner and I also hate cornbread
Makes me wonder why I don't eat more bbq lol. Glad the kids finally got to try it l. 😆
As a cornbread lover, I need to know if you had them try normal cornbread or sweet cornbread?
Cornbread probably wasn't sweet enough
Mack looks straight up like a young Brad Pitt
Gotta try pickles with ranch dressing lol
1. Surprised how many preferred British beans over Southern BBQ style   2. Corn bread is phenomenal, but a lot of places don't make it well (too dry, too bland, etc)
"It is absolutely sublime!" LOL! Never have truer world been spoken in reference to Texas BBQ!
Southern tea is known has SWEET TEA. And Cornbread is great with melted butter on top. I want to see Rev. Chris try to eat ribs
Cornbread is for a glass of milk at the end. Crumble it up
Burnt ends are a staple of Kansas City BBQ. I know it’s common for foreigners to call all American bbq Texas bbq but there’s a variety of styles by region.
Love to our cousins across the pond. Love seeing the spirit of america awaken in our friends (eagle scream). God bless us all
Poor kids will never look at uk food the same 😂
I'm definitely going to miss Southern BBQ when I move to Europe, but it's not enough to make me want to stay here
they need to try beer bread lol
"You're the funny one." xDD Indeed
take the brisket and cut it up and put it in the mac n cheese with bbq sauce
Brits feel sorry for American healthcare, Americans feel sorry for Brits never eating delicious heart attack-inducing food...
I ❤ when you do videos with the high schoolers, they have to be my favorite, I love how honest they are!!
They just ate 1500 British pounds worth of meat. Probably more protein than they're ever seen in any one place...
Cornbread is definitely hit and miss. I've never been a huge fan, but I've found a few places that have phenomenal cornbread (usually paired with whipped honey butter).
13:40 them’s fightin words
best part .. they ddint give them a heads up on the jalapeno in the sausage until after they bit into it
Goku
I love them i love everyone i love the world the world is beautiful i love everyone forever
The cornbread comment would send my town in a frenzy
The best part of Texas BBQ is our friendly “competitions”.  200-300 pit smokers in one location for 3 days. Every type of meat and side you can think of in a giant park or around a lake. Half the people there don’t plan on winning. It’s just an excuse to camp out or setup your RV rig. 3 days of friends, beer drinking and endless sampling of the most delicious food on earth.   Just be prepared to burn your clothes by the end of the event. 3 days of mesquite and post oak smoke will not come out of that t-shirt.😊
british people dont like beans?
Where was the creamed corn?
You need to put lots of honey in that cornbread! Well done boys, we Americans appreciate your honest opinions.
They’re going to be chasing this food high for the rest of their lives
The Head master is so funny !!!
Not all cornbread is equal
I absolutely love this content.
Big props to the kid that understood the cornbread and what it does with absorbing everything.  It counters the richness of the meat.  Smart kid, he will go far!
Im not even Texan and this makes me feel proud.
A little known fact is Macaroni Cheese was actually invented in England hundreds of years ago
Its like these children fell out a time capsule, its pretty crazy how they've never had brisket before. Actually its crazy how the majority of the world has never eaten true American food.
They gotta try corn bread with honey and butter
People act like Americans have no culture but we are a powerhouse when it comes to food. It may not be a crazy range with spices or etc. But the meals born from our poverty over the decades have formed a true legacy no matter how much people want to ignore it or claim its from another country.
God it’s so rare I say this…this is why we CAN have nice things! Food brings everyone together
We don’t eat dry cornbread in America. At least put a lot of butter on it!
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." Matthew 6:33 🪻✨️
Add a pinch of sugar to cornbread it makes it a tad sweeter!
this is the equivalent of putting sugar in front of an ant and then taking it away after it went to go tell its friends
British people hating cornbread is hilarious.
No greens of any kind was a diabolical move
SO DID Y'ALL BRING THIS OVER FROM A SPECIFIC TX PLACE OR MAKE IT IN LONDON BUT BASED OFF TX BBQ?
Texas has good bbq but I see in the comments no one mention the king of bbq. Kansas City bbq with its burnt ends. Only they can do it proper.
The reason why USA has a lot of fat people: sedentary lifestyle but most importantly the food can be addicting. (Emphasis on can be because not everything in USA tastes great)
Apologies to whoever smoked the meats but uh, that’s a 6/10 for me dawg. The struggle with the collagen is giving bad vibes.  13 hour smoke low temperature. It’s the only way.
Y’all need to come to TX! ❤😊
Bath your cornbread n butter, and depending on source there is sweet and unsweetened cornbread. Many say unsweetened is purest and best but i love sweet cornbread.
Yes, southern BBQ is like nothing else you'll eat.  It's sooooooo goooood!
Having spent weeks in the UK I believe these reactions, because there is no seasoning on the food there unless you eat Indian or Caribbean food. 😂
The kid that doesn’t like cornbread (I don’t like as well, and beans hate beans) but make him cornbread casserole and it will change your mind like it did mine! My hate of beans will never change so yeah! My mom is South African and she loves beans on toast! My dad is from England and he doesn’t care for it as well… so I have tried beans on toast and dislike it so much lol… 😂 but to each their own! And heard u r coming to Hawaii! Do a meet and greet so I could please meet u! ❤😂
This made me so happy to watch!  Texas BBQ is amazing!!!!
My opinion if someone asked me for a cup of tea I would give them a hot cup of tea but as a Texan if someone asked me for a Glass of tea I would give them a glass of sweet tea
Josh really looks like Jim Carrey and I can't it out of my mind.
I’d like a behind the scenes video of how you transport all this American food to England. I can’t even get my food to stay tasty from the drive through to the house. 🤔
I might sound old but those are not high schoolers… maybe middle school
How do you get BBQ from here in Texas to England and it still tastes like it’s supposed to?
I'm watching this while eating 2 minute noodles fml
cornbread has GOTTA be done right, put some honey on it or something
These lil cavemen are gonna have the meat sweats!
I still dont like cake like cornbread. Im more for the grainy style cornbread. Both are good but i like grainy
Too much sugar ruins sweet tea. Every time I see a video about sweet tea they put too much sugar. Good sweet tea still tastes like tea. 1.5 cups of sugar or 300 grams.
I've lived in Texas my entire life (38 years) and never once have I ever heard anyone call it the "Texas Fold."  You get to hamburger buns and make a brisket sandwich.
Seeing them eat makes me want to eat it also.. Its mouth watering.. I love this british kids, their so polite even though at some point they dont like some of the food, their just gonna say "its not for me" .. I love them..❤  P. S. Mack look like Bradd Pitt..🫣
"everything's better with bread" that needs to be a viral clip.  my replacement for Oprah's "i. love. bread" lmao.  it's very correct and very fun
you should have them try sweet corn bread! i grew up in california and we had BBQ restaurants that would serve sweet corn bread with little corn pieces in it! sooo good and it gives it a bit more flavor than what they tried
when it comes to sausages,i always peel off the outer casing on it and then eat the meat. the casing is too chewy for me
The lil homie Harry was loving it lol
I’m American and not a corn bread fan 😮haha just saying 😂
This was great:  the littlest boy with the dark curly hair stole my heart.
You can tell which boys that will be going to Austin, Texas as soon as possible. You can almost see their future selves in a tank top, beer in hand eating bbq
Now twach theae kids how to cook all of that and then help them open a smoked brisket shop there
Their reactions say everything you need to know about why Americans have heart disease.
6:33  the American music in the background is killing me😂
When things get more chill in the US, y'all have to bring the headmaster! He's so much fun 😂
As a Minnesotan, Texas is my favorite state for food. Minnesota is not so much😂😂😂
Having to put the beans on the bread was funny 😂
Corn bread is 10x better with melted butter, dry isn't too impressive.
Love from America, your videos are awesome. Next time you cross the pond please for the love of god try some classic American meats. My personal favorites are rattlesnake roasted in nopales, possum roast, raccoon, jackrabbit, bear roast, jack rabbit chilli, and squirrel stew. Lot of history in those dishes. Also bear lard makes the hands down best pie crust. Cheers.
I'm not Texan...I'm TN but I think I have almost never been as proud as when they all went cave man on the Rib......Merica baby! Tap into unmittigated inner cave man satisfaction.
Why is he brown
When with tilt their heads back, you know it hit a special place!!
How would they feel to know we have those restaurants on every corner
America has the greatest food.
Food gasms are real lol. Brits meet spices and flavor 😂😂😂😂
yooo, when he said its like eating a crouton, I fell off my chair lol
Kentucky here. That is not real Southern cornbread! Real is thicker, unsweet, and less cake like. Also, not usually served with Barbecue. Most of us use Garlic Toast. NEXT, that Sweet tea isn't right! You gave them boys WEAK TEA! No way! Real iced tea is brewed nearly mahogany. This is so to allow the ice to melt without turning it into wash water. Common recipe is a gallon (or so) water in a bucket on the stove, turn it to high heat. Add just about a tea bag for every two cups of water, or three. Yes, add it to the water before it boils. When it boils, turn it off and let it steep about 15 min, or good and dark. Take out tea, squeeze the dickins out of them into pot. Add a cup (or so) of sugar for every gallon of tea. Might let it cool a bit. Pour over a nearly full glass of ice, serve. I abominate lemon in tea, but if you like it, go ahead.(No accounting for taste, said the old lady when she kissed the cow).
Dear friends across the Pond,  For the cornbread: add heat and more, MUCH more, butter. You can even cook cornbread with peppers like jalapenos (not my preference), but it's GOT to be buttery. You have to have residue on your fingers.  Cheers, mates,  A Southerner with expat family
Now do the same series at an all girls Highschool
They get to eat that for free. They’re lucky
As a southern I am 👏 OFFENDED. Whoever made the cornbread didn't do it right. It's supposed to be sweet and have butter on it. Good cornbread is not bland.
A southern USA restaurant would do phenomenal there.
Teenage boys + food XD
You CAN NOT have corn bread with out buttter and honey!
Watching British people eat Texas BBQ is like watching someone give a Victorian poor child a nacho cheese dorito
I love these reactions! Made my day!
PUT THE CORNBREAD IN THE BEANS!!
I am so jealous
I love that this is just a regular meal to me and to them it’s the best they’ve ever had lol. God bless Texas!
Now they know why we are fat 😂😂😂😂
Please try cornbread with some honey and butter or some of your favorite jam!
Cornbread is made so many different ways. Dry, moist, corn bits, no corn bits..... well.... I guess that's about it.
How exactly did you get the food to them?
How did you get it there?
As a waitress in a BBQ shack in Fulton Texas this warms my heart to hear how they describe BBQ❤
Watching this from here Austin texas,my home, only thing yall are missing is not any tea but Bill Millers Tea!
seems like some of those kids would rather have a can of Van Camp's baked beans (sadly)
But is bettah than big bowl o banana fish pea soup innit? Salivating just FINKING ABOUDIT
Can you say food coma..lol
“I don’t think I can eat food here anymore “. 😂
10:36 "I don't fink I can eat food here anymore" 😅
texas fold ==> should have put more meat
My son Harry, having a religious experience.
after all the great food, I wonder if these kids have a greater appreciation for the USA
I just love their comments and reaction to U.S. food
Absolutely hilarious
This was adorable 😂❤
I have watched so many of your shows and at some point in every single video I always say to myself, those kids never have enough napkins.
That looks like some great BBQ - would love to know who made it.
You need to try Pan de Elote (Mexican corn bread) it’s such a different taste and texture.  I saw the faces of disappointment after trying those ribs.
I wanna know how they transported all this food over
In all fairness, cornbread is better with butter. And now they know why so many people are obese in the US. 😂
The excitement they got from pickles is precisely how I feel everyone I eat pickles and I eat and make my own pickles.
Now you know why Americans are so f@t! 😂
Brits tasting actual food lol
america so rich we can afford to wait 16 hours to eat our meat
That kid really shed a tear 😂
I was waiting for one of them to say “now I know why Americans are so fat”
I like it when Mr. Smith is here 😂
Never been a fan of baked Mac
Need to butter sugar In natter
Smoke pit BBQ has to be the most uniquely American food and I love it
I love the last one. " I'm still comprehending the flavors."
The cornbread slander! No!!! 😅
A genuine chicken-fried steak would complete the circle.
British people are used to eating beans and unflavored sausage there food is so ass 😂
Segregation still in u.k
They're so sweet!
Between US and UK black people, who wins?
Eating a crouton 😂
It’s so much fun seeing people enjoy our food so much.
Should give them jalapeño cheese sausage…. Yum!
Do they bring a chef to Europe or do they come here? Lol
UK pork ribs look like it’s 90% bones
As i am from Texas it amazes me other countries do not smoke bbq like us. Awesome to see the reactions though. Makes me a proud Texan
Hope this was the end of the day
America freaking sucks right now but at least there's BBQ.
Get these kids some Californian mexican food
The ice tea looks like arnold palmer (tea and lemonade mix)
Hope this was the end of the day
The headmaster needs to go w you to the US the next time you go
Hate to do it, but please follow me in doing so, unfollowing all channels that choose"members only".  Bad enough we have to watch all these commercials.  A big FU to all you money grubbing content creators
I’m was a Vengan for 10 years till last day I ate bacon omg my world view change and this video pushed it
I live in Texas and I don't think mac and cheese needs any crispy bits on top of it. It actually ruins what it's supposed to be
Now you get a sense of why we're all so fat. lol, but no, the next step is brisket with mac and cheese and you'll lose half your population to us.
The headmaster parts are my favorite. 😂
Brits know proper baking and pastries. Sorry cornbread lol. Harry is so precious 🩵 Monty and Freddy are too cool 😎
Finally you gave them the good stuff
U have to have sweet cornbread not skillet with melty butter--try "jiffy" and one side u 4got is yellow potatoe salad(mustard)hmmm and we call it "smoked sausage" nxt time wrap it in a piece of sliced bteas bread👍🏽❤️
Brings tears to my American eyes
How do get the food?
I'm sure they would still prefer beans on toast.
This show is amazing
that kid looks like the kid ‘goob’ in meet the robinsons
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Dangggg I'm craving Texas bbq now! Grrrrr 🤤🤤🤤
bro said " are you lying ? " and then went straight to " he's not lying " 😂😂😂
One of the students looks just like Brad Pitt when he was younger
Wait till they see Latinas
I love sweet cornbread!
I’m guessing an enterprising Texan could make a fortune with a barbecue restaurant in England.
I don’t like Cornbread either.  My Mom would always cook Cornbread and Pinto Beans and insisted me to eat Cornbread and I hate it
I live in Texas and never heard a Texas fold. I’ve heard a Brisket Sandwich though. 🤣
I feel like they all should understand why Americans are fat now 😂
They're realizing "So THIS is what we were supposed to do with the spices"
I love these kids
As a Texan, Texas is the greatest country in the WORLD!
They are in for a delicious surprise.
Le titre étant en français pour cette vidéo ... j'ai fais une belle découverte !   OMG i am little bite more fat just looking those meals. I like corn but i HATE the f*** cornbread. I gave a piece to my dog and he don't talk to me for a week !!!  LOL  Big kisses of gratitude from Gatineau, QUÉBEC ... XOX
What. No cobbler?
In all fairness, ANY cuisine is better than British food 🤢
Please bring Headmaster Dave to Texas. He's hilarious. And I don't like crusty bits in my Mac and cheese, either..LOL
I'm not fond of regular cornbread, but I had a version once that was moist, not gritty, and it was sweet and tasted like a sweet corn cake rather than a dry corn bread.
Add butter to the cornbread or add the beans on top of the cornbread. I love cornbread with my chili.
As someone who has had beans on toast in Britain.. BBQ Beans are infinitely better. Not even in the same universe.  Cornbread has as much flavor as their beans.
I love the videos with the students the best. Thanks for sharing.
Food coma in coming. I'm a Texan & I'm feeling all the emotions rn.
10:55 Unfortunately, that mac and cheese looks too dry to eat. I would not eat it.
Look, there’s a reason Americans are dealing with rampant obesity Food like this.
Mission BBQ at noon. Just trust me.
that iced tea is no where near dark enough
How about girl students? Would they eat delicately or chow down?
3:53 Jesus close you mouth you chew like a cow
3:10 you go right ahead and eat all the fat you want. Brisket is delicious but you dont eat the fat. Might as well let someone spit snot in your mouth.
Brits discovering flavor for the first time:
Our cousins gone be chasing a taste that they won’t get again until they visit America 🇺🇸🤣🔥
1:21 poor kid on the left only got Fat because the didn't peel off the huge layer of fat before serving it. Fucking gross. 2:09 WTF No fat is fat that is disgusting. Sure cook it with it on but you aren't supposed to eat it.
Please please plesse for thr sake of all that is holu give them some Cajun food. It's another one of America's centerpiece cuisines and wikl command the same disbelief in response
Southern corn bread is truly overrated. Dry ass crumbly bs, and theyre absolutely delusional about it here. Good take at the end
I was surprised they put the beans on bread, British people are weird.
This is why the south is fat and happy
lol I’m so white and it’s been confirmed by me and them agreeing that the breadcrumbs on mac and cheese is gross lol
take the boys to texas!!
And other countries wonder why the people in America are overweight look at all the good food we have. LOL.
They learned another reason why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle live in America.😂
I’ve always wanted to know if the head master was single 😀
You guys may need them to try a better cornbread. Just sayin
The Headmaster lost a few pounds. Looking good!
It’s so cute watching British people eat real food. Welcome to why Americans are so fat boys 😂 PS the black Brits need to ask their grandparents about bbq. It’s originally a cooking technique from Africa and was perfected by American slaves and blacks in the Caribbean and West Indies. PS that Mac&cheese is suspect.
why don't yall ever put honey butter spread on that cornbread ...... dry cornbread is the worst also why you crumble it into chili gives it abit more substance and texture
Sad. This channel uses kids! Exploits them and doesn’t compensate them.
Do you compensate these kids for basically making your video?
I love seeing them love our southern food. ❤
It’ll be coming to a supermarket near you soon.  The U.K is now  accepting the import of American meats.
Lord have mercy.. So proper and so precious as they can be
I *just* had barbecue two days ago and this is making me want to go right back
Moist brisket vs lean brisket.  Y'all called it fat brisket.. lol
Do these kids go back to class after these? I'm from Texas and after a BBQ lunch, I am ready to pass the F out for 2 hours.
So, you took a group of kids to South Korea. Now, are you going to take a group to the US?
Good afternoon, boys! Texan here. Glad you enjoyed our food so much. I think next you need to try some Tex Mex, then some kolaches. A lot of people don't understand the significance of the Six Flags. That's six different cultures bringing six different cuisines here. Thankfully we get to enjoy all that culinary crossbreeding and we love to share it with everyone.
Yay for American food!
The music is so unnecessary and overstimulating.
Some ppl like my family puts a little sugar in their cornbread but my aunt made a new recipe with sweet potato (yams) and the cornbread it’s so good it’s called sweet potato cornbread
Just wait till they get the meat sweats lmao 🤣 and take a 5 hour nap
These just always make me so happy
WANTING a bland mac & cheese is a War Crime 😫
What I like the most about these videos is how polite and well-spoken the students are. Honestly it gives me hope for the future!
Brits love everything with bread ive noticed. Also pickles make everything better :)
Need honey butter for the cornbread!
southerner here. i'm not a huge fan of cornbread myself. i'm not knocking it. just not a fan like the one guy
That first boy STUFFED a big hunk in his mouth; epic! And bread is the delivery system for  a mixture of food. 😋
Where is the honey butter for the corn bread?
My American best friend had to go live in England for her dad’s job…she said it was all beans , spam , and toast there. She absolutely hated what they all ate
"if it's getting a bit too much flavor" lol my man.
These boys are going to have a massive case of meat sweats.
Aww love this :)
Texan here. Those poor kids! They had the wrong cornbread!
Now do you understand the obesity epidemic? Can you blame us?
My fav series
These poor kids been deprived of so much good food
If the cornbread was bland then it wasn't done right. Cornbread is suppose to have a kind of sweet taste to it. And that was the weakest looking tea I've ever seen. I thought it was juice. Are Pit Beans another name for baked beans? That BBQ looked amazing.
Oh brisket, my love 😩🤤
Trust me kid, you DO NOT want to move to America 😂 im saving up to leave this hell hole
The cornbread must have been made incorrectly!
As a non-southern american, we can agree that southern tea is a travesty, but otherwise everything else is heaven.
As a Texan, we welcome everyone (we are known for our southern hospitality after all); but we only have 1 rule, don’t bring liberal ideology.
The video we’ve all been waiting for
Oklahoman here. I didn't much like cornbread growing up either, for the same reasons they mentioned, its often dry and bland. I found the solution however, cream corn. It makes it lighter and fluffier and not as gritty. I also like to use jalapeños and I will coat the pan I cook it in with butter and brown sugar, this caramelizes into a sweet crust that goes great with the spicy jalapeños. You can also mix in shredded cheddar ke sprinkle it on top or both!
Hardly a bad thing to say about it! Every last fella is tucking in.
I bet you the original kids like Rory are punching the air right now lol
From texas and i still dont know why Europeans love texas so damn much
Called it!!
As a Texas/Louisiana Cajun... These kids haven't seen nothing yet...
That's lovely. 😋
NAPKINS...NAPKINS...NAPKINS...🧐
Those black kids met their ancestors
Sorry guys, the cornbread looks very dry. I make cornbread all the time, and mine tastes and looks like cake.
🎉❤
of course they still put the beans on toast lol
I love that the boy's are not afraid to try new foods. I love your content, an the kids.
Hello from New York! I always enjoy watching these kids-they are so funny! But my favorite of course is the Headmaster! I hope they do come to the US one day. Even NY has some fantastic BBQ restaurants.
The jolly guys are honorary Texans, they destroy British food everytime there’s a Texas criticism 😂
Shout out to the parents that had to feed these kids beans on toast after they had their minds blown 😂
And Brits wonder why we're usually so fat XD try some Texas BBQ and tell me you wouldn't eat your life away.
2:01 why does he look and sound like Goob from Meet the Robinsons 😂
You need margarine on your cornbread
Texas BBQ is the best BBQ
My mouth is watering, and I am from Texas!
It doesnt get much better than Burnt Brisket Ends. At some BBQ joints you can order the burnt ends as an entree.  Yeah, y'all. There is a reason why so many of us are fat as we are.
the bread needed honey
I don't like cornbread either. I've tried it different ways it's just not for me.
You gotta get that one kid some better cornbread. Not all of it is bland.
They bout to eat besns and toast the next day lol
10:18 Clip That XD
Texas is king of BBQ
They fed them FROZEN Mac and cheese….. no one eats that garbage here.
I hope this was at the end of the day lol they all bout to have the itis. Basically a sleepy spell that comes after you eat a bunch of soul food or greasy food 😂
10:12  that “crack” is actually called the “knack” of a sausage.  To the sausage connoisseur, your sausage isn’t made right if it doesnt have a good knack.
I bet every man in England that you got to eat all of this is going to leave England and apply for citizenship especially to Texas
There first bite of cornbread wasnt a Jiffy corn muffin…. Missed opportunity..
Honestly, I felt it in my soul when that one boy said "I can never eat here again".... They're going to have to start learning to cook it at home! haha
Put honey or butter on the cornbread.
The shade thrown on the cornbread is a letdown, haha. They should have made them jalapeno cornbread!
I think the Headmaster is ready to relocate to a Private School or University in Texas.
ROFLMAO pls don't ever make cornbread again BAHAHAHA
" I DON'T THINK WE CAN EAT FOOD HERE ANYMORE"
They would have liked the cornbread had someone from the south made it.
They all reserve their drinks. No free refills there lol
Can we see some girls try these foods already?!
That cornbread looked awfully dry. I think y'all need a new recipe. Also, pork ribs looked a bit dry too. They should slide off the bone as well. Sincerely, A Southerner.
Watching them enjoy Texas barbecue is cruel and unusual punishment!
As a Texan I am proud to say that there is nothing like real Texas BBQ and I'd give up my first born for some of that right now ... 😂 ... stuck in Tennessee where all they put on the grill is a pig
Kids need honey butter cornbread and my sweet tea. I make the tea very strong to counter the sugar. Get wired fast on it. My southern grandma made it that way. Love that one young black man that ate like he was starving. I love to feed people with appetites. My grandsons are this way. Also the teacher.  Always try something new
That cornbread looked very dry.  Traditionally made with a buttermilk to help not be dry plus before baking gets poured into sizzling hot skillet or pan to form a sort of crust to keep in moisture (like searing a roast or steak).    In the U.S. south, not sweetened but at diner's discretion can be topped with butter, honey or more buttermilk after serving.  When corn is in season, often corn, corn milk, creamed corn or whatever corn leftovers you have can be added.  In the north, they do corn "muffins"  versus "bread" -- they add sugar, syrup, or honey and often bake in regular cake pans or muffin tins without the sizzled crust.  In the southwest, don't be surprised to find hatch ("New Mexico") chiles or jalapeños added along with whatever corn or salsa fixings you had leftover from other kitchen adventures.  Generally not sweetened but I've seen that change if hotter peppers are used or oddly when served with spicier BBQ meats.
Grew up in western Texas, and I still have the same reaction as these kids when a mesquite brisket is in my prescence.
When the British go on "Holiday" is that the same thing we Americans call a "vacation"?  Probably a dumb question I know.
The best BBQ in the world comes from my great state of Texas. Made an awesome brisket this weekend started cooking it Friday and Saturday night had some great brisket.
Now you know why Americans are so fat. We grow this stuff in our back yard (cows).
Next they'll open a Texas BBQ restaurant in London.
11:08 why does ollie look so pained/ offended here😭😭
Corn bread needs butter and honey or molasses
no???? the 2024 and 2025 comparison is crazy. a boy can grow that much???? 😢
11:25 fin.
You lnow it's a bad sign when British say it's bland....
This makes my ol' southern heart happy. I love watching people enjoy the food we got here. ❤
These young men are peak adorableness. They give me hope for tomorrow.   Thank you for sharing them with us.
Love you guys.
Don’t they have BBQ places in the UK ??  Why haven’t any Americans gone over and opened their own BBQ shacks ??  I hope some of these young, bright kids seek the idea of opening a BBQ in the UK or Europe.👏🇺🇸
I’ve worked as a meat slicer and with pit masters in bbq restaurants from Virginia to Texas; it’s what I use to do for a living. I was the guy who loaded the meats onto the pits, threw in the firewood, stayed overnight to keep the fire going, etc.  My all time favorite Texas BBQ besides the beef rib is my sweet tea glazed ribs. Take you a rack of ribs, cook them to your liking, and at the end slather on some Luzianne sweet tea concentrate (the bottle that says “just add water”) as a glaze and finish it off on a hot grill.  I promise you will thank me.
Also as a Texan, what the hell is with the cornbread? Most of the BBQ places I know don't bother with cornbread, we got Texas toast. I don't even like cornbread myself
As an American, Id much prefer more of our taxes go towards this type of thing.
You just know they all had the meat sweats later.
Texan here, so unbelievably proud of our bbq and I’m so happy to see these gentlemen enjoy our pride and joy
That principal loves you guys lol
The cornbread did look ass ngl 😂
next up: british kids try american barbers for the first time cuz GOOD LORD
Cornbread slander will not be tolerated
Die KI Übersetzung, ist unerträglich!
Not even going to ask this as an asshole. But is there a reason behind white kids with whites, black with blacks? I’ve been a fan for years, and grew up very diverse. I’m just curious.
you're the funny one...lol
Damm im in Houston and those ribs look like the ones Flintstones have 😂😂😂
Next time try the cornbread dipped or topped with a bit of honey butter. Instantly cuts through the fats, spices, and saltiness
Wow. It is 1am and now I really want some ribs. Sadly, the BBQ place down the road from me recently closed. I will now have to drive a bit to satisfy my craving tomorrow~
It’s called sweet tea
I heard people in Britain dont eat meat, not that its a delicacy or something like that but more so that fish in more available.
Don’t worry you’re accepted we want you to grown up here in America since Britain and UK sucks ass Come seek asylum you’re our people already
🤔🤔🤔 am i seeing what im seeing wow put the 3 black kids together  to share with each other and put 2 Groups of white kids together to share a plate whites are racist no matter where we at smh wow
Ollie being absolutely gobsmacked 11:08 when he heard the comment about the crispy bit
They didn't show the black kids eat the cornbread 😂😂
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore" 🤣🤣🤣
Oh Lord, poor kids are so deprived lol, they just grab it and throw it down 🤣. Their descriptions keep it classy 🤣.
10:27 😭💀💀😂💀😭🔥 his eyes.
7:12 I love the teacher his expressions are like he has fallen in love and can’t understand why
Here in Texas hill country, you get a bag of bread, pickles, and onions. Brisket and sausage is my fav. I love that they enjoyed it!
Show this to the UK Tiktokers who keep saying America doesn’t have culture/good food 🤣
Do they not have pickles in England? What do you mean you’ve never had pickles? How do you get so excited over pickles? Is it, like, a rare delicacy?
Should have had butter on the cornbread. It makes a world of difference.
3:43 the pure happiness is GOLD 😭😭🙏🏽💪🏾
Give them citizenship  🇺🇸
In the south we say we like a little tea with our sugar.😉
Im leaving yall making hungry!!! At 11pm at night
British teens get heart failure next
I know terry blacks when I see it
I drive 4 hrs round trip in Oklahoma just for bbq beans from a tiny gas station in the middle of nowhere. Sublime.
Did you all hire a Texas barbecue chef to come over to England to cook this up?
What I wonder after all of these videos is what, if any, meal that the kids have had again since the shooting. Like, did they introduce the food to their parents, or go to a specialty restaurant?
Adorable 🎉
Why do they all look and sound 3-4 years older than they actually are😂
Did y'all bring fresh ribs to the UK? How old was this food when they ate it?
Wait until these kids try out smoked turkey legs. Now, that is glorious by itself.
Yo the principal is a super cool dude
You could open up a Texas BBQ restaurant in England and be a billionaire in a few years.😊
13:40 Oh… those are fighting words 🥊
I’ll be honest, if I was in their shoes, I would’ve acted like that one grandpa from Food Wars. Maybe I would’ve came a bit.
As a Texan, we love this. It feels good to call our food "lovely " 😂❤
Pickles are cucumbers.
My favorite Jolly is still the biscuits and gravy episode but this is a very very close 2nd.
my boss: why are u late to work? me: ive been watching british highschoolers try american food all night long for too long
How did the English conquer the world for spices and then just never use them?
When the one boy said he'd never had ribs before... what do the Brits do with that part of the cow/pig/etc.?
I would never eat that stuff, I’m a vegetarian, but I find it delicious watching other people eat it and absolutely loving it…
There is supposed to be a garlic bread. Where was the butter on the cornbread? Why did you put the the baked beans on toast? That would make them taste awful. They aren't British beans.

So much more to BBQ than this  as a non Texan Okahoman I don't ever eat cornbread with BBQ  Most  people around here pick a slice of white or wheat bread side,  and  usually a version of  cold potato salad or  mac and cheese  or french fries    coleslaw,  sometimes a slice of raw onion or a pickled jalapeno  (and my favorite side beans have no meat  -baked northern white beans cooked  with hickory BBQ sauce, a tablespoon of honey or molasses  or maple syrup ,and a few drops of Louisiana Hot Sauce . )  The meat is cooked the same way as the meat you tried, but hickory wood is used over mesquite wood the farther east you go. The farther SE you go, the BBQ sauce uses  vinegar and mustard instead of a tomato sauce base.
Put some butter and honey on that cornbread!
I've never felt more Texas pride than I do watching this
As an American who loves BBQ, most of us can't eat it everyday.  It's really expensive and (while I love it) we'd die in short order.
These are so fun to watch!  We don't put our beans with bread or toast, so I think that might be part of why they didn't like the beans... I feel like I wouldn't like 'em that way, either! LOL
Now I’m craving bbq. Also not all cornbread tastes the same. Some is amazing. Some is bland.
10:35 "I don't even think... I can...eat food HERE ANYMORE!' 😂😂😂😂
I always enjoy watching the students enjoy cuisine they've never tried before.  And the headmaster needs to join you two for a few cities in the States to try authentic dishes in the hometown of origin.  He would lose his mind from sheer delight! 😄 As for the cornbread, someone may have messed up the ratio of ingredients, or were given a sub par recipe.  Because good cornbread is never as tasteless as most of the kids stated.  It is warm, perfectly textured and absolutely delicious on its own.  With a nice pat of butter of course. 😋💙
I love how most of them immediately put the beans on the bread...like that's the only way they know to eat them.
Moving to the U.K. and opening a barbecue joint
Tommy….whats your response to this?  Texas brisket and burnt ends obliterate all
As a Texan I have some comments.   First off the cornbread... yeah never been a fan myself unless its Boston Market "Cornbread" which is actually cornbread and yellow cake, that all being said usually if I have normal cornbread its for soaking up liquid in like a stew or something, I never eat it by itself.   Also when you did that Texas fold, first off in my 30 years in Texas I have never once heard it being called that, but secondly, the fact that you didn't use Texas Toast was egregious!  Lastly, that kid was right, if you could eat it every day you would but there are 2 limiting factors, even in Texas, which is time and money. I've made ribs that take 12 hours to smoke before so unless you want to go to a restaurant its more for off days. But then going to even like the crappiest BBQs are still going to run you like $15-$20 per meal. Which is why usually this is reserved for the weekends when watching the game or the fights with the boys, holidays as well like 4th of July.
Finally! It's about time you brought these kids back. And Dave! We love your channel, but honestly, it's time you let someone else do the eating. Both channels have just been watching Josh and Olly eat lately. Boring.
What restaurant is this from?
“I don’t think I can eat food here anymore.” 😂😂😂
Beans on toast or BBQ , not a real question ...  🙏🏻🇺🇸😃🤙🏻
This is the greatest thing ever 🤣
they eating like they stoned
They should've put butter on the cornbread.
That cornbread didn't sound like it had sugar, whole corn in it or butter on it. That tea definitely sounded like it didn't have enough sugar 😂
love being from Texas
I live in austin tx and go to terry blacks all the time... Its the best...
Oh no! They put the beans on toast!! 😂
This is one of the best things I have ever seen.
3 British and 1 African trying American bbq.
My man thought he was getting a new car, and they gave him 15% off 😂😂😂 Bro!!! What?!
This is actually scary to watch. These dudes brought diabetes and heart disease and parasites overseas 🤦 ofcourse it tastes amazing. All the most addictive drugs make you feel that rush of dopamine (aka that warm hug feeling). We know it feels like a hug, so we call it "comfort food" 🙄 it's poison, kids. It's delicious, but it's horrible for your well-being. Btw, every american that goes to england says that the food is atrocious. Everything here in the u.s. is loaded with sugar and salt and god knows what else
Had a texas style bbq spread for my wedding. Can’t go wrong
Here we observe young Brits experiencing flavor for the first time
Hearing about a "Texas Fold" for the 1st time ever as a Houstonian...lol
My favorite 2025 video... Thanks guys!
I’m confused on how they got this food??
somehow this made me feel patriotic as my country is actively inciting world war III. who would’ve thunk.
All of their parents are so disappointed that they didn't use their forks, knives and napkins🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Native Texan here. It's a shame you didn't like the cornbread. Though from what I'm looking at, you were done an injustice by the "cornbread" presented to ya. Glad you guys liked the brisket, but what y'all got served seemed dry as all hell.
😂. All the Mmmms says everything!! When it's really good, you'll have a little wiggle in your seat. 😉 (Happy dance).
and they wonder how america got so fat. lol
I've been watching you guys so long that the Headmaster has started balding 😂
Right, 4:17 or so, our man Smith's eyes right after he bites into the Fold. You know, you Know there can be no doubt, that's a good bit of nomnom right there.
That food looks amazing! I’m sad that I had a piece of frozen pizza for dinner 😢
If they've ever wondered why we're all fat, now they know!
How long does it take to bring a texas bbq to Britain
They are so cute!
I love how they instinctively put the chili on bread. Never even considered doing that in my life.
Murica 🇺🇲
11:34 Most British thing ever.
Where’s that bbq from please?😅just curious❤
I bet they were in a meat coma after the video.  😂😂😂
I wanted to see the original students with Theo in it eating Texas barbecue. I've waited for them 😊
12th Generation Texan here and we officially want to adopt the Headmaster!  Please bring him to America!
As an American 🇺🇸 it feels good that someone is enjoying something from country even though we’ve been inflicting hell in the world. ❤
I guess girls don't get to be part of your food experience... A bit ridiculous I would say.
Kid at 3:53 chews like Wallace and grommet
You’re the funny ohe
Such lovely boys. I love the fact that they have an open mind and willing to try the food instead looking at it and criticizing without willing to try it. I always say you never know if you like it until you try it. Thank you so much.
GET THESE CHILDREN TO THE SOUTH
Sounds like an authentic barbecue restaurant could make a fortune in the UK!
you need sweet cornbread
Should have added butter and honey to the cornbread 👌🏼🤤
To cut them some slack, that corn bread did look pretty dry 😅
seeing what food british people eat, its no wonder theyre amazed
Corn bread you just need honey to put on it now that’s lovely,  do you guys have honey?
I'm American and I had a smile this whole video, come on by y'all. With everything going on in the world right now I feel like people may hate us, this is what most Americans are though, just good food, good times and a hope for better days. If you come to visit, don't miss out on the rural parts of our country! It may feel like there's nothing to do but you'll find the experience of a lifetime if you look hard enough.
Where was the potato salad?
As a Texan this makes my heart happy! 😊
I have never seen anyone eat cornbread without butter (or honey butter)! That was a missed trick, unfortunately - maybe next time!
It was so cute when the young man said “I don’t think I could eat food here anymore”!.😂😂😂
You know the prinicple loves when these guys come in, he is gonna get a good meal outta it
How do you keep anyone in Great Britain after eating Texas 🍖barbecue
Man, these kids are grubbing just like us! Big Love from Nashville, y'all!
Listen, we don’t all make our cornbread like that. Some people like it bland because all they want is for it to soak up the juices and flavors of what they eat. My family and I on the other hand love a sweet cornbread. And when feeling like a little extra but lazy, the jiffy blueberry cornbread is so good. Yes the cornbread might taste like cake or muffins but it beats the bland, dry, crumbly texture for me.
❤❤❤❤So good y'all! ❤❤❤
Lovely = Fire in Britain
Oh I love those boys! ❤
Finally
What age can you move to America? Give it some time mate. Trump is stopping all the fun in America. We might not have food soon.
I wonder how many of them have stomach aches after from trying all our rich American food lol
Is this Africa?
Needed jalapeño and cheese smoked sausage with smoked boudain with a side of Mexican cornbread 🤤🤤tasty.
I’m just wondering how bad food is in England? I’ve always heard it’s pretty bad and I get such a kick out of everyone from there trying food in United States.
I love the reactions from the young men.
U guys are bullstuffin’ with the “ages” of these kids😂
Tx gal here, Don’t hate on our cornbread till you slather it in salted butter , I also grew up with my pawpaw crumbled it up in a glass of buttermilk and eat it with a spoon , YUM 😋  ❤fromTx
Americans know how to eat 🙌🏼
American here. I mean this as a compliment, every high schooler in this video looks like students at hogwarts
as someone whos in the states and lives in california, i wanna try this sooooo bad!! im sure the ones in texas is nothing compared to what texas might have
You didn't give them the honey butter for the corn bread
There’s a bbq place down the street from me in Texas that has a family meal where you get 6 pounds of any meat and 6 quart sized sides for $270.
Doing the lords work. Sharing true American food
You gotta put butter and honey on the cornbread!! 😭
As a Houstonian, I approve of this video!
Cornbread can be a bit dry, smearing on some butter helps.
😂😂😂.Enjoy.
I’m salivating just watching them eat
Those poor children. Feeding English children English food is child abuse!
It's wonderful to see them enjoying Texas bbq. We do love our bbq here. 😂❤
I'm ashamed to say that I don't have bbq very often and I live in Austin TX. I love it, but always forget about it.
Should of got the sweet cornbread lol
see how slender all those young Brits are?.... well they won't stay that way if they start eating the way we Americans do
Welcome to America, kings 🫡🇺🇸🇬🇧
As a teen from louisiana, living in texas I am proud to say that I have never liked cornbread, it has always seemed so bland and overhyped to me.
The British are so sad, our un evolved counterparts.
KC BBQ is THE ultimate!
These are the funniest, sweetest kids and the headmaster is absolutely adorable! I’m so happy seeing them enjoy really good southern bbq1
NGL, seeing this video of British High Schoolers and the School Master trying American BBQ for the first time really just had made my day 😅😊.
HEAD MASTER IS IN HEAVEN
I loved watching this video. Thank you for sharing some of our food culture😊
Theo would have had a great reaction.  That boy loved everything!
they mentioned how the sausage snaps when you bite into it. I had the opposite experience LMAO. when I went to the UK, I was horribly surprised that the sausage DIDN'T have that snap in it!
I just need to know WHERE did the meal come from!  I'm salivating
Love❤ how they enjoy it so…. But with such huge American portions, I think they might have some stomach discomfort later on. 😂
so cute!! I love how they just go for it!
I love that English people use way more of the English Language than Americans lol
I love watching these kids eating American food. Especially southern BBQ!
Mac looks like a teenage version of Brad Pitt. :)
I fuckin live in the states and eat this stuff all the time, and my reaction is still the same as their's!😂
Love from Texas ⭑🤠𓃗 Based in Dallas, just got back from Austin. Can't go wrong with Texas BBQ!
Need some butter & honey on that cornbread
Brits need a little butter on their corn bread!  😆
I literally flew to Texas just to eat 😂 I cant wait to go back
Aint no pickles in the uk?
Cornbread with butter and honey, compliment bbq. Never plain.
I been in texas all my life when it comes to bbq it can't be beat
I dont know what it is about watching foreigners eat american food that makes me smile so much the whole time im like " :D " well, now i hope they understand why Americans are so fatty LOL !
Those pork ribs are way over done
Poor boys. Should have grown up here
YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT HOT BUTTER AND HONEY ON THE CORN BREAD !!  JALAPENOS
I don’t think I can eat food here anymore hahahaha.. stay in the UK fella.. it sucks over here right now
You should go onna "field trip" with them to america have the try dif things straight at the source
Don't you love how they play Land of Hope and Glory in the background while these boys and the headmaster are getting down with this BBQ?
As a Texan i approve of this
I dunno about you other southerns but for me, the cornbread has to be either covered in butter. Like straight up soggy with it. Or littered with jalapeños. I feel like some of the kiddos liking the spice would’ve enjoyed a jalapeño cornbread
God bbq is indeed a religious experience.
Texas used to have an embassy in London. England needs some Texas fast before all is lost. It’s a spirit your raised into
The kid who called cornbread like a sponge cake is pretty much correct. Youre supposed to keep the cornbread on your plate around to soak up all the juices on your plate like a sponge, so it adds to the flavor of the bread.
sad people living on a sad little island with bland food.
They might have liked the cornbread more if there was butter to go with it. Or maybe jalapeños baked in. 🌶 🧈
Come to Hawaii
I make brisket every Sunday
Lol they should've had some butter with the cornbread! Of course it would've made for an even fattier meal but just cornbread and butter on their own are so good.
HEY TEXANS!!!!!! THE STARS AT NIGHT, ARE BIG AND BRIGHT👏👏👏....
They got  British The Office haircuts
You have to eat the corn bread with some pinto beans to get the real benefit.
Oh no we just introduced flavor to the English
He just needs a little buttermilk with that cornbread!!
Lol 🫶🏾
After eating all that deliciousness a nap usually follows😆
I think that jalapeno cornbread would have changed their minds a bit with some butter on it
11:54 broooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Maybe we should send Texas on a side quest to unite the world using BBQ 🍖 😂
They will all fall asleep when they get back to class 😂
They couldn't even find enough white kids in the UK to make this video
Americas gift to the planet is a super slow cooked brisket. We mastered flavors and spices for the sake of living a good life filled with joy and cheerfulness!
Headmaster Smith, Harry, and Kavan had the best reactions!
You’d love my cornbread……you need to put butter and honey on it. I also add a lil sugar to my cornbread mix 👍🏼
when the meat falls off the bone you know it's good bbq. these kids must be having a life changing experience. I only had it like that once over a decade ago in Austin TX and still remember it.
Ollie had some nerve telling that kid he had given a horrible analogy. 😆
These boys are going to have the meat sweats for days!!!! Lol
Cornbread needs honey butter
The need a big bowl of Blue Bell for dessert.
So cool watching the headmaster getting the meat sweats!
That is not a 9 year old lmao
Does anyone know how this works? Like is it flown in and reheated or does someone go over and make it there? Like is there a tax bbq joint in London?
5:45 your gift to the principle was to make him buy data with your discount code? 😅😂 you’re taking the piss
There are like 10 BBQ joints within 2 miles from me .
As a fellow American, All I can say is….we know how to BBQ
Vacation in Texas ,our food is the best in the whole country!
Sub par non Kansas City BBQ
Half of the kids are British
BBQ is probably the best food in the world. Especially from a rinky dink food truck.
If it has sugar and is sweet, then it isn't a true southern corn bread. It's not a cake.
Glad you guys like our food here in texas!
British kid - it’s absolutely sublime 😂
Dude I want some Texas bbq is there any like a real authentic Texas bbq in LA
I love the Head Master going, for it is great!! Love it!! And the kids just going for it!!  The ones that don't care for the corn bread, try it with a honey butter!
Seeing their reaction to Texas bbq makes me want to open a shop in my old hometown. I live in America but my hometown is Amesbury.
Refreshing to hear kids speak actual sentences and not slang…god job fellas
“He’s lying…. He’s not lying” 😂
Someone, from our beloved Texas, needs to go over to England  and open a BBQ joint for those poor people … ohhhh maybe make it Tex Mex! 😮 lol  🤯 😅
Not America, boys - TEXAS 🇨🇱!!!
Why do that to the poor lads! They'll never be the same
As a Cali man I LOVE Texas bbq
Now they understand why everything is bigger in Texas - including our rear end and tummy
Will you please let the girls get in on some of this?
The joy of food is wonderful
Life changing! America could win a war with that! 🇺🇸  I'm so happy for them!
I just KNOW everybody got extremely sleepy after this feast 😂😂
13:46  😂😂😂
Now they know why us Americans are so fat…lol
With everything going on the the world these videos make me appreciate the things I have access to and why it’s important to stand up for whats right, so that we can still have these things we love a treasure.
Next they get to learn about meat sweats and "the itis"
They're adorable. They eat BBQ just like we do!
I'm from the south and I can attest to the fact that most cornbread should go in the bin.
You haven't lived until you've introduced a European friend to Texas BBQ. It's like they discovered a new taste bud.
These poor kids are going to randomly crave texas bbq now
Also you left out the finishing touch to the meal, banana pudding!
Just here for the headmaster.
I can't believe you didn't do the southern green beans and collard greens
You have to slather butter on the cornbread otherwise it can be dry. That’s where you messed up.
Texas fold>>?>? we just called it bread tacos. a real Texan
Yall messed up the cornbread. No way they didn’t like that if you did it right, trick is to mix a little yellow cake mix into the cornbread mix and it makes it sweeter, cook that and then dip it in some milk and mmmMMmmMmmm that’s a good country meal
Very good but it's also why we're so fat
Carolina Barbecue is better it's all about the vinegar-based sauce none of that sweet molasses BS
Wait...are pickles not a thing in Britain?
Texas food is the best food in the world!
This is why we are overweight. The food is so good. And we are a melting pot of good food from everywhere. If you have something you don't like, there are quite literally like 20 other options within a 10 minute drive in most major areas.
We call that redneck tacos
"That's lovely." A brit supreme complement.
From the US, you are welcome young men.  Our Texas BBQ is glorious.
You got shorted should have had a slice of pie pech is sooo goooddddd😊
Even the headmaster joined in 😂
10:01 they give Max and Armand vibes❤❤❤😂😊
Corn bread is only good when their is actual corn in it.
I always love seeing foreigners try Texas BBQ for the first time. We Americans take a lot of flak from over there (not from everyone of course) for "not having any culture." Or, "not contributing anything to the world outside of warfare."  To them I always say the same thing, "You've obviously never tried southern food..." LMAO Thanks guys! We appreciate you sharing a piece of our gift to the world!
It's like they've never eaten food before.
Brisket is my favorite thing to eat. Occasionally I will spend a day cooking one. A day spent on cooking something is nothing less than extraordinary.
I love that in every video the headmaster seems to be extremely disappointed he wasn't born American
You gotta have some honey and butter with your cornbread!
As a Texan, this does my heart good to see these boys enjoying our BBQ.  I disagree with your choice of sausage, however.  I'm glad they didn't complain their mouths were on fire since you chose the jalapeno kind.  Give them chicken next time.  It's my favorite.   I'm so amazed none of them got any sauce on their beautifully white shirts.
“British people try real food for the first time”
We don't do the crispy topping in North Carolina.
I love these reactions!! We love Brits in the south, feel free to come over anytime!
These have to be the little brothers of the other students over the years
@1:23 he shoved that piece of brisket in his mouth so fast, you would've thought somebody was gonna steal it from him! 😂 This is so awesome!
Did they get the meat from gold belly?
Hmmm....is the School Master a MAGA supporter ? (Blue suit coat, white shirt, red tie)
This is amazing! Bring them to the south for more southern hospitality.
Love these kids! Texas BBQ is an experience.
To eat Mac N Cheese with a fork upside down (non-American way) is a dichotomy!
I saw the title and looked at the days it's been out for 3 days these kids are still in school! man I wouldn't survive another week.
Love the content. Bring those boys to the south. We will feed them well.
Good eaters! 😄👍
Brisket is my favorite part of the cow!!! I like it well done though.
An American food tour as a summer trip for these kids would be tastebud overload. They deserve the treat.
What no pork or bologna
Yum! "Make me a sammich!" 🙂
You need cast iron cornbread
I hope you gave them wet towels and not just those little serviettes!
Surprise, it doesn't compare to that bland limey food they grew up on.
They didn’t use enough BBQ sauce
What the hell do they eat over there?
I would LOVE to cook for these folks.
I feel bad for british kids, man. all they have is jellied eels and cigarette butt pie.
Notice the difference in education by the language used
Why do you guys keep forgetting the BUTTER for the cornbread?
As a Texan this warms my heart ❤️
Im obsessed with the kid who keeps saying "lovely" - So stinking cute.
Don't eat ramen while watching these videos guys, it's bad for your soul. Speaking from experience :(
Jolly has done more to advertise Texas BBQ than cowboys.
i didnt realize they still had segregation in the UK
Broke my ankle coming to this video
It’s so funny - hysterical, how bland English food is compared to American.   Or Korean!!  Love these videos.   Thank you!
Who makes this food for the boys?? Lol
bro fr said hed rather go to mcdonalds oh my god....he better not ever step foot in the us
Omg, have been dying to see you introduce Texas bbq, especially to Dave.   Please take him on your next USA roadtrip!  These videos are so freaking hysterical (for me, an American) to see.  Love it!!!
Give them some Jalapeño Poppers! Bacon-wrapped, Cream-cheesy Goodness!
To be fair cornbread is meant to be eaten with a honey butter or something similar
From Texas and I aprove everything...
Esim apps like that are a rip off. Get a local Sim or esim when you land. 1/4 the price and better signal.
TASTE THAT FREEDOM BABY
The head master would love American 🇺🇸
Easily the best food on earth, when we have to meet aliens that might decide to eat us, we just feed them smoked brisket. Either it'll be so good they need us to keep making it for them or the spices will kill them, we will know their weaknesses either way.
I live in South Carolina and southern food if done right is top tier, you have to find a good place though there’s a lot of mid bbq places that are very expensive
Let me make the cornbread you will love it  The one y’all had looked too dry
And people wonder why us Americans are larger than we need to be. The food is just so good.
As a lifelong resident of Texas, I have not once called a Brisket Sandwich a "Texas Fold". Lol
That’s the taste of 1776 Freedom!!!!!!
Venison and pork sausage is also a good one
The headmaster and his expressions >>
As an American Anglophile, I can’t express how happy these videos make me. The texture, flavor, and smell of Texas BBQ will change/fix your life 😂
😂 me watching Britts learn about “meat sweats” in real time.
I guess yall understand now why we're so proud to be Texan 😂  We take our eatin' seriously
This is why Texans struggle with their waistlines. 😋
I’m so jealous. My mouth is watering like crazy.
Im a millennial so im slightly younger than when Godfrey hit the scene but ive always known who he was. Seeing this interview made me a fan.  Very funny, extremely intelligent and i looked him up it says 55 but theres no way hes looks AMAZING. Seeing a confident, unafraid, and intelligent BM is very sexy. I can see his candor made a few of them uncomfortable at times. Great video.
They're sadly ruining these kids' lives by exposing them to food with seasoning. Poor guys never knew what they were missing out on. 🤣
Just love that they gave the British the Mexican or Western Ranch version of baked beans and those boys said they like the beans they get for breakfast which they say are *BRITISH*BEANS*! Actually, the pork and beans served in British cafes, schools, restaurants are the canned variety imported from the United States of America! (ask them! They will admit it!)
Oh you poor deprived children! How DO you survive without Southern BBQ? Hahaha! So very good!
It’s nice to see our friends across the pond enjoy some nice brisket and other various smoked meats!  I can understand their mixed reactions to the cornbread. Cornbread is only doable for me when I scrape a thin layer of butter over it. If there’s no butter to be had, then I just skip the cornbread.
British folks eat our food and instantly realize they don't need to eat like the Germans are overhead anymore.
Cornbread needs to be eaten hot right out of the oven smothered in butter. Texas iced tea was traditionally unsweetened. Drinkers would then sweeten to their preferred taste. Sweet tea comes from the rest of the south (and far East Texas), but it has become more popular in Texas in recent years. (I am an 8th generation Texan from Fort Worth.)
HOW are these kids keeping their uniforms CLEAN???  By this time my clothes would look like a visual representation of the menu! 😮😜 Next:  Go south and bring in a Brazilian bbq! 👍😜👍
This is why God is not real. Instead of telling us not to wear mixed fabrics, it could have told us how to make Texas BBQ! Think of how many wars would have been avoided LOL :)
:59 7 years old?! Wtf haha
I believe that Texas BBQ could be the key to a successful campaign for actual American world domination (rather than the practical domination we have now)
How do you even film these? Are these kids in Britain and you fly out the BBQ?
I've never heard anyone call it "Fatty brisket" here in Texas. Always call it moist or lean.
As a 9th generation Texan I approve of this,  nothing beats Texas brisket.
when people from other countries as what is American Food implying that we have borrowed everything from everywhere else or do not have a culinary culture i always replay with BBQ its all american and its awesome
Bless them all. Made me smile today.
The mop bucket corn bread analogy was poetry
DAMMIT!!!  Now I want some!!! You guys are EVVIILLL!!! 🤤🤤🥲🥲😜😜
Come and gain this American 70lbs ☺️ It’s worth it lol.
Poor brits. To grow up and then live most or all their life in that country with the most bland, boring food is a shame.  And yes, I know. Great curries or whatever. All of which that came from countries they invaded.
How do you guys get the food to Britain? Like Taco Bell and jolly-bee?
Put down the fork and knife, and no one gets hurt.
Sucks they have to grow up in the country w the worst cuisine in the world 💔
I don’t even think I can eat here anymore! The best comment of the day!
Did they fly these kids to texas? Or fly texans out to these lads and have them cook for the kids?
Seems like a Texas barbecue restaurant in London would be an instant hit!
It looks like you’ve turned proper Brits into savages. Lol.
I hope they don't  have to go back to class. Lol its time for a nap!
Ronda here from Houston TX.  Love good barbeque.  I usually eat it with plenty of bbq sauce and onions - yum
These kids have be deprived of good food for so long they BEGGED for more bland food. What an atrocity the UK has done to your people. You never recovered from wartime foods.
Who is preparing this food for the students? Are they physically in the UK or are they visiting the US and getting this food?
Put ketchup on mac and cheese. You will either hate it or it will break you from not having it. Works best with creamy and milder.
I just love these vids with the high schoolers. Their reactions are just priceless and so honest and sincere. Cornbread needs lots of butter and honey to make it palatable. PS I love the "fall off the bone" ribs, but for some reason, in BBQ competition the judges hate that. They want a tug off the rib to eat it.
Pork ribs looked a little dry, tough, and meatless. The mac and the beans didn’t look that great either. Also where’s the dessert? No peach cobbler or banana puddin?
Who made the cornbread for it to be bland 😂😂😂
I love watching these kids try American food! My husband made a brisket yesterday and it was a labor of love definitely worth time it takes to make it.  I’m glad they enjoyed a majority of it. And I gotta say I’m not a big fan of the fancier crumb covered mac and cheese either.
This trend will never get old
You need to shred some of the Beef Rib meet and put it in some Mac N Cheese.
who cooked  the food!
Love these videos
You have to put butter and honey on the cornbread.
"I don't even feel like I can eat food here anymore"  🤣😭🤣😅
So they took all that from from America to London ?? Because if not then it’s not real BBQ
When I lived in Scotland from 1979-87, our neighbors didn't even know what BBQ was. We used to have massive parties in the summer. Dad would grill burgers and hot dogs. To them a burger was literally ground up pork ham turned into a pattie and served on a super soft bun. Now they all grill outside in all weather and they are now learning about southern smoked BBQ. They will never be the same again.  America's education system should also take note of these kid's ages, the grades they are in and their massive vocabulary. American kids this same age couldn't tell you what most of their big words mean. When we moved back her in 1987, I was 4 years above my grade. It totally sucked because my parents wouldn't allow me to test out and I was so bored. I wasted so many opportunities to shine in school to show my classmates how lacking their education was, but hind sight is always 20//20.
😍😍😍😍 Y’all are welcome to TX anytime!
I love watching these... one of the things that makes me proud to be American (all ng with the giggles)🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧❤️
First thought. "Oh my god, this actually has flavor, other the whorstshire sauce."
The way my jaw dropped when I saw them put the beans on toast. I shouldn't have been surprised, but it really caught me off guard 😂
Who made the food
Why are all the groups segregated?
Omg, I want to try Brisket. Where do I find this in Texas?
Is that a Mammoth Mountain shirt?!? I've been riding there for 40 years. So cool to see you've brought that to the UK!
9/10 video. Only disappointment was that y’all didn’t get good cornbread for them to try. Corn bread is a delicacy. But only when made right. That one youth is scarred.
From Odessa, Texas, I'm laughing at these kids.
Gotta have pinto beans with smoked hammocks.
You guys need to add some sugar to your cornbread. Completely changes the taste and texture. Not much, for one box of Jiffy, do about a quarter cup of sugar. You’ll thank me later. 🙏🏽🙏🏽
These kids are so stinkin adorable, lol! I love their descriptions, and the curly haired kid was so polite in the way he spoke and described everything. As a born n' raised Texan, I can tell you I react like this every time I eat BBQ Brisket, haha!
Cornbread can be a little dry and bland at times. It is way better with butter on it.
I died with "you're the fatty one" 🤣
Cornbread has many different tastes depending on the restaurant or home cooking.  Cornbread hot out of the oven with butter and slow cooked beans is delicious, and cornbread with chicken and dumplings.
You can make fun of America all you want, give them some Southern BBQ and they'd all switch allegiances.
Have the tried cajun food? Might blow their minds :)
The cornbread should have butter or honey butter on it.
Not everyone makes cornbread the same. I recomend a BLACK Soul Food cook to prepare not only the cornbread but everything on that table!!!!
Where is the roll of paper towels? Never dinner napkins.
Inquiring minds want to know how you get all these different foods to England and they all look like they just came out of the oven ....
Don't give up on cornbread little dude! Everyone makes it differently. Sounds like a bad batch to me
It's always a joy when people find new love of food. Food is really amazing. Brings the best out of all of us. :3
They should try the corbread with honey. That was always my favorite thing as a kid
Well, cornbread does require a second bite...they need to put butter (and only real butter) on the cornbread. In Texas, we put jalapenos in it. And in Virginia, we added sugar...
Noooooooo! I love cornbread 😊
'Absolutely sublime'
Now let them do some blood tests 2 days later 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s crazy to see how these boys quickly learn to eat bbq like an American. But it would blow their minds if the saw that women in Texas eat exactly the same way.
When they got to the ribs I smiled lol cause I understand
We’re here in America watching this with tears in our eyes. Bless your British hearts
Needs to be warm with melted butter and honey
"The bark is the best part"... oh yeah it is. Here in Texas you get chose if you want fatty brisket and you should always say yes...and he is correct, the crunchy 'bark' IS the best part... Welcome to Texas baby❤
I love how you guys appreciate America culture and show respect I know we look crazy as a nation at the moment but it’s not a representation of all of us… thank you.
Love this lol
Four of them immediately moved to America.
I'm glad they got the authentic cornbread tradition. The real challenge of american cuisine is trying to make cornbread taste good. Few are those who can accomplish this feat
I know they slept good asf after
If you’re cornbread taste like paper, it ain’t made right 😭😭
nothing cooler than eating something so good it literally produces tears
Brisket is amazing. Though I get the criticism of cornbread, I'm not a big fan either. Would prefer a roll, most of the time.
Mmmmmm now I want burnt ends
Texas BBQ with no BBQ Sauce is just foul….
이젠 한국어 자막 안 달아주시는건가요 ㅠ…
I live in the south, not a fan of cornbread eather, to dry
Introducing the meat sweats to the British haha. (I said sweats... not sweets). It's a common condition we Americans all enjoy after consuming copious amounts of meats!
I'm just about always disappointed, here in the U.S., with BBQ sides, including the baked beans and cornbread, and the macaroni has never been good. Sometimes the coleslaw is good. However, some places serve a nice bread pudding for dessert. So, skip all the bland sides so you can save room, because, how can you have your pudding if you don't eat your meat?
"That looks lovely"
corn bread has to be sweet and served warm with butter. otherwise it is dry.
Cornbread should be served hot, moist and buttered.
poor kids had no idea the afternoon classes were going to be so hard....FOOD COMA hit right after eating all the meats.
The one kid has the idis 😂😂😂😂
I'm in Texas. It's great to see these young men enjoy the food.
You guys are so much fun!
Open up an American restaurant over there with Texas barbecue
Cornbread needs melted butter and honey to make it a chefs kiss experience.
Cornbread needs to come from the south, not Texas. Southern grannies know their cornbread.
This just proves how bland British food is😂😂😂😂
Texan here and brisket is life. Im so glad they love it.
😂😂😂
The reason why Americans are so fat is because the food everywhere is amazing lol. You want any kind of food you can find it.
Another example of what happiness looks like
Cornbread requires butter and honey!
I wonder if any of the kids get nauseated later because they're eating spices they've never had.
Each bite gets lodged in your aorta.
Good BBQ isn't food. It's a spiritual experience. Lol
Seems like the cornbread was too dry. It should be sweet and buttery
Burnt ends are not from Texas. They're from Kansas City
A good Texas brisket is literally the best tasting thing on the planet.
Uk people seeing what theyre missing out of. Obviously eating like this like some people in the us all the time isnt good, but its nice to see people in the uk (which ive watched on youtube for years) finally see what theyre missing out of lol. Theres so much more cultures out there that have so much flavor and variety they need to try. From the years ive seen uk youtube, of the their best meals seems to be a roast or english breakfast lol. Ima foodie so id eat everything they eat too and enjoy it. But it aint texas bbq lol
Tennessean here....Try fried cornbread.. what yall ate isn't cornbread... that junk is too dry.
Mesquite wood makes the best steak btw
Murica. You might get shot at school, but we have good bbq!!
I will say if you don’t get fresh cornbread right out of the oven then it does become bland and stale quickly
3heading
You need to put butter on your cornbread, you silly buggers! 😂
Native Texan here... Let me make that cornbread and I guarantee you it won't be bland
Barbeque is the one and only thing that tempts me to overeat. Because your tastebuds keep crying for more, even when your belly is full! 😂 So, order enough extra that you'll have next day leftovers to look forward to.😊
The wonder these lads express!
This is why we're fat!
then after filming this video, the kids had to return home to their parents, dinner of beans and tuna😂😂😂
That corn bread needs some butter on it. A lot of butter
Bring the headmaster to the usa we demand our requests be fulfilled Now!!!
Hahaha!!  They are so sweet!!
The teacher/principal probably looks forward to getting asked to try American foods. Lucky guy!
corn bread has to be warm and slathered in butter! shame on u jolly 😂
Born and raised in Texas. And Texas BBQ is🔥🔥🔥
Wait to the little black kids try fried chicken. Their gonna fuckin lose it.
Ha ha, love this from Southern Georgia!! Eat up boyz!
Serving the school boys & headmaster American cuisine is my favorite part of your channel! ❤❤
Gotta put butter on the cornbread
Nothing like bonding over BBQ. Good BBQ and good company makes all the other problems go away....even if it's just for a few hours.
I ❤ these never stop....
What a proud day to be from Texas 😌
The queens fabric 😂😂😂😂😂
I want fo know if  Malachi caleb jack keaton max armand natti jayden harvey ray  Dagi jerome theo lorenzo Max tommy Ricky rory Together at the same room with food n games what will happend 😂
my mouth watering looking at the food!!!
2:53 it cant be more british highschooler than this😂😂😂
Clearly I need to find somebody black ass Southern Grandma to make the cornbread cuz clearly that cornbread didn't get cooked in a cast iron skillet and where is the fucking butter bro someone fumbled that cornbread heavy cuz it ain't no reason that cornbread should have looked like that you failed do it over😂😂
I think Ollie died a little when the kid said he didn't like the crusty bits.
12:51 3-0 baby!! 🎉😂
A new highschooler video, hooray! We need more of these....MOOOOORRRE!
So fun to watch!
I wonder how they are getting the kids to the fresh bbq or fresh bbq to the kids in England?
Barbecue so good, the headmaster slipped out of posh gear and went back in for "anovver one!"
I dont think I'll ever be able to describe the job it brings me watching young kids from the UK being introduced to our foods, and by extention, some of our culture here in America.  My family made fun of me at first for watching these videos. Made them watch once, now we all love the videos.
LOL-they are adorable LOL
My kids think I'm weird when I put leftover slaw on my sandwiches. I feel so vindicated right now.
Love this!   As a US southerner, we don't eat our baked beans on bread or toast - we just eat then with a spoon (or a fork, if the sauce is thick enough).
they're hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You gotta show them jiify cornbread with some honey in it or lightly spread on top
I will agree with them about the tea. I'm from Louisiana and literally all i drink is tea, but sometimes yall need to chill on the sugar lmao. Same goes for Kool-Aid. I get diabetes just watching my mom make a pitcher 😆
My lord I love the Headmaster. SO cute! 🥰  Bring him with you to the States next time, I can keep him fed…in so many ways! 😂  Three squares a day, no need for snacks, because he is one!
The kids have so much personality!!! Damn I wish I had a bite of some of that brisket!!!! 😮‍💨 But I'd go STRAIGHT for the cornbread. That alternation of savory with sweet.Gah. I need to go grocery shopping and I'm watching this drooling.  You can bet my grocery shopping is going to be crazy!
There is nothing in the world that compares to Texas BBQ's.
Cornbread requires a lot of butter, or – like they touched on – use it to sop up the juice and fat. It's lie a block of sandpaper when eaten on it's own.
Have you seen the 2 guys Josh and Jase? They are also British. They have a YouTube page  and show their travels in the US trying American food.
It looks like a BBQ restaurant would be pretty successful there.
These brits 😂
That was delightful.  I love it when anyone experiences good BBQ for the first time. It's like a baby discovering how good ice cream is.  People just lose their minds over food being THAT good.
A damn shame the USA is such a shithole country w/what Trump has done of irreparable damage.  How the mighty USA has fallen, lol.
"Never make cornbread again.."  I recoiled.
This is one of the BEST food-themed bits on the internet! Whether it's something the kids love or hate, their unvarnished reactions are always engaging. Love the headmaster, too! Even your built-in ad is worth listening to.  Now that you've introduced the boys to BBQ, you need to give them some from each of the major BBQ regions - KC, Memphis, Carolina (my fave), and of course a reprise on this Texas. Find out which style is preferred.
The accents are so precious...Hearing BQ called "Lovely", is very endearing...They all looked enthusiastic for the meats! Love how they all have on a jacket and Tie...True class...:)
british people are so pretentious
The South just declared war for that cornbread comment.
They would fit right in with those big bites in Texas!!!!
I think the boys got shortchanged on the cornbread. The cornbread I grew up eating was served warm and moist and the top crust had a sprinkling of sugar.  (Damn, now I want some cornbread!)
They looking  really jolly.
I am sooo happy for them! Watching their faces like experiencing it for the first time again! 😂🙏
I'm mad that they let them put our beans on bread!!! 🤦🏾‍♀️ That's not how you eat our baked beans so of course they didn't like them. Lawd! 🤦🏾‍♀️😂
British baked beans aka canned beans
Pretty sure the headmaster could find a career traveling across America & eating each region's specialty dishes 😂
Harry is my new favorite! He's like Max 2.0 for me❤
T'ats lovle
Love the boy that says he can’t eat food here anymore. They are figuring out how bland and bad British food typically is. They shouldn’t have brought this food to them. Now they will be disappointed every day in their normal food.
They all looked like they were gonna cry lmfao
Should've had somone proper cook that cornbread jajaja 😅 not everyone can make it good
See yall didn’t use jiffy and hella sugar. Next time try sweet potato or cinnamon cornbread
맛있겠다😁👍🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
“Are you lying? He’s not lying”😂😂😂
The meat sweats after this must of been brutal, lolz.
They should've told them to put the beans on the cornbread because that's the perfect mix ❤
I feel like the headmaster just invites them back to get delicious food 😂
Corn bread is delicious but that thing looked DRY as all get out
You should have them try Cajun Food next time
Someone once said, "The food that tastes good is not British food." It must be true. 🤣
now you understand why we who live in the US are so fat.
Everybody who made that cornbread didn’t do too well because southern grandma black make a sweet
Everybody who made that cornbread didn’t do too well because southern grandma black make a sweet
Time to move to England and open up a Texas BBQ joint 💰💰💰💰
As a southern CORN BREAD IS S MUST IN a lot of dishes we cook sorry 😂but every one corn bread is not all good either
W
Is he lying…oh he is not lying 😂😂😂😂😂
I've lived my entire life in Texas and I had the same blank/confused reaction to ""Texas Fold" as they did.
Bro the kid grew fast asf kinda 😂
whenever I see British schools my mind goes like "we don't need no education ...."
As a Texan, you're welcome. ;)
Shi tbh cornbread is good to mix with not just eat by itself I be mixing shi while im eating
Their toilet is gonna have a time tonight! 😂😂😂
I’m seriously smiling at these beautiful babies……my bad for calling them “babies” I’m a mom so it’s a habit my sons are 15&18😭😭😭 they’ll forever be my babies but whatever i just love this.
The headmaster needs to move, bro. Every time he eats American food he looks like he’s ascending.
Sublime? I don't think I have ever heard a teenager use that word. They will remember this until they are old. I'm American, and my husband was born in Texas. We took a 1/2 year camping trip in 2013, and there was a restaurant, only opened from Friday afternoon-Sunday IF. They preferred if orders were placed, but this is where Sunday IF came in. So, IF there was any left, you could buy. I appreciate the boys being truthful. I loved watching their expressions. God bless them all, including their teacher.
Watching this the night before surgery where I cannot eat anything. I must hate myself.
2:44 HE DID THE THING HE DID THE THING OLLIE DOES SOMETIMES
They all will need a nap 😂😂😂  This is what we call, “the itis!”
Guess I’m having brisket for lunch in 8 hours  😂😂
The both of you laugh as anything and everything… most is forced…not every comment should be met with a giggle…. I have watched a many of your videos… the exaggerated faces…. Enough guys    .. the one with the sunglasses seems so taken with himself…
Should have put butter patties on the cornbread..
It's a shame they didn't have the cornbread with butter which adds so much to it. I like mac and cheese, but like them it's not the best thing. Pork ribs are godly, as is nicely done brisket. BBQ in the US has so many different styles and sauces, it's just one of those wonderful things to try when you travel. I love that these kids are so well behaved and well spoken, and just watching them be blown away by this wonderful food is so fun. The American biscuits and gravy episode was a good one too, because when they were told what they were getting they had no idea why people would put gravy on cookies!
No extra butter on the cornbread.
People make fun of Americans for being fat but our food is off the the fvcking chain.
These guys are the best.
They didn't get good cornbread. You could tell it was dry and crumbled.
As a Kansas City native, I am legally obligated to inform you that KC barbecue is better.
Never had a pickle!!!???  I am literally so jealous! My mouth is watering. I must go to smokin oak tomorrow. Vancouver, WA USA.
I like that little one he made me laugh the most
Genuine joy, excellent upload
He said, in a daze "I'm not _comprehending_ the flavors." 😂😂😂
I like to mix the mac n cheese with the beans! And your cornbread needs more butter. 😋
AHAHAHAH ZADOK THE PRIEST PLAYING FOR THAT SLOWCOOKED MEAT
I would have buttered that cornbread.
I'm with them on the cornbread, can't stand it.
The teacher/head guy person is in heaven. I think he will become an American soon !
It has to be sweet cornbread regular cornbread sucks
No matter how messed up things are, you two and those kids always make me laugh. Thank you, I needed that.
Someone needs to show Tom Holland this because clearly he said that British food is better than American food.
Food is really a universal exhange. Love watching them all try things and enjoy it. It will push these kids to explore the world and other cultures.
Making me so proud of Texas
Now they have to visit Texas if not they’ll be craving this the rest of their lives
This was fun thank you 🩷🥰
Poor kids
11:35 "It's too cheesy. It's a different kind of cheese. Too rich." "Oh you want it to be more bland?" "Exactly right". lololol
Headmaster is the goat
Okay fine I’ll go get Pinkerton’s again!
Cornbread has to be done right. I could tell by looking at it, it wasn’t.
“The British Are Coming” ….to Texas😋🇬🇧
Everyone likes their cornbread different. I agree some cornbread is bland. If it’s on the bland side butter and honey are recommended. We make our cornbread with more sugar in the batter. But we still like adding honey and butter haha
This makes me crave some bbq at 1 am lmao
I feel like these poor young men missed the boat on corn bread.  Noone likes cornbread plain. Add a little butter and honey and you'd leave your  wife for it
1:00 “Its like a huge razor." Lol
this was just an okay platter, they're just british and tasting flavor for the first time
Those poor children are going to lie awake at night remembering these flavors but never able to have them again. Being able to have bbq ONCE is almost more of a curse than a blessing, better to not know it exists.
Cornbread with hot honey!! Top tier in my opinion
Insulting cornbread is considered a declaration of war here.
Whipped butter and honey with the corn bread
Aaaand this is why we are fat over here and everything is "bigger in Texas" 😂 you think this is too much, you should see us with a taco platter.
Gotta put butter on that cornbread.
XD they used to have only Bangers and Mash but they have just CONSUMED Ambrosia
It’s late at night and yall are making me wish our barbecue would be open 24/7
I pray this doesn’t offend, but, even tho they have access to the same foods as Americans, it seems like the Brits never experimented with their foods past WWII. Glad they got to enjoy!
I feel sorry for the poor black kids i know have never had soul food 😂 they just some what connected to some roots with that flavor explosion.
Texan here. I agree..pickles ruin it
Wait till they find out you have to deal with Texans if you want real texas bbq. Food so good......still not worth it.
Man corn bread is just one of those things... Soak it in butter... Drop it in ur beans... Hell my grandpa used to put it in a glass of milk n eat it... I'm glad y'all like Texas BBQ but come to Texas n try real Texas BBQ... With Spanish rice guacamole chips jalapeno with cream cheese wrapped in bacon a big ass baked potato cooked in the coals of a mesquite wood fire with a big bowl of pico de Gallo bread or tortillas heated on that mesquite wood fire ribs cooked with beer BBQ chicken... If u need sauce u went to the wrong BBQ lol... Sauce is for folks that can't cook
As an American, this is the kind of energy I would bring on a visit to Europe. Nothing brings people together like a meal. Or Brisket. 😂
Like letting a baby taste BBQ sauce for the first time.
Pls make one where they try soul food
I am not from Texas, or any of the other meccas of BBQ, but many people venture to the west and bring their taste buds and cooking style with them!   I totally agree with the kid that said the cornbread cuts the grease, if you fed them pure meat until they got beef sweats, they all would have appreciated the cornbread!    That said… you didn’t give them honey butter spread?!? So long as the cornbread is naturally sweetened by the corn (and yes a bit of sugar), you need to have  to have honey butter. If the cornbread is already too sweet, the battle is lost and just dip it in the chili!
Cornbread varies a lot in TX. There are sweet cornbreads, jalapeño cornbread,... Some are bad, but when done right? (Same with the mac:) Nothing is better! Y'all didn't follow up with buttermilk pie! What gives?  And TX  beans are the bomb- headmaster gets the award!!😂
I'm from the South. I don't like cornbread.😂
Texan here! Imagine how much better is here!
So how are you bringing them this authentic American food? Did yall bring an American cook or what?
Gotta add a slab of butter to that cornbread
UK food doesnt compare glad these brits got a chance to eat some real meat
Class is done for the day!  They will be in a meat coma!  😊😊😊😊😊
4:17 you can't fake that face. 🇨🇱🇺🇲
Memphis barbecue,  Nashville barbecue,  Kansas city barbecue,  and Texas barbecue are here waiting for you,  gentlemen! Love these videos.  I hope these young blokes are starting to see why so many Americans are overweight! Lol
The cornbread comment are fuggrjnf words! What did you feed him. We need a CB redo!
British beans are just Heinz vegetarian beans
They now understand why when a southern American comes to the uk and hates the food
Dang... Pete Davidsons little brother was loving that bbq. Eyes popping the whole time.
This makes me miss Texas. Pickles, brisket, spicy bbq sauce. Heaven.
Good thing we threw that tea in the harbor or we would have terrible food
God bless America!
You got to try cornbread with butter and also their are different ways to make it some make it sweet.
"This Texas toast would be brilliant with those beans, innit?"
Poor British kid said yeah I’ve had that bread before😂😂
It's like I can taste it through the video. 🤤
Butter and Honey on the cornbread!
I feel like the corn bread not having butter and honey was a missed opportunity 😂
One of those boys looks like a young Brad Pitt.
Their facial expressions look like they're doing coke
I ❤ you guys videos! And this one is great! I live in South Korea where they have a few Texas BBQ places. I ordered some from a close place and had my BIL for dinner. He absolutely thought he'd died and went to heaven. He told me to find another one and took me to it for my birthday. Expensive, but worth totally worth it. Truly a near spiritual experience  😋
after a decade eating tuna and beans with cheese these guys are in heaven
You forgot to add cheese, jalapeños, butter, and honey to the cornbread. Then it will be amazing! We have a bunch of British youth ready to move to Texas!😂❤
as an American I found this highly entertaining!
I'm a southerner and cornbread is really dry, but that's why you use it to sop up the juices
I love this series of British kids eating our food.
I’m hungry for bbq now!!!
As a Texan who smokes tx bbq, I enjoy watching this :)
8:18 I'm with them on the cornbread. You gotta dip it in some beans or sauce or something. Or mix in in bites. After BBQ it's just a dry brick to me.
Cornbread strikes me as an off note with Texas bbq - plain white sandwich bread was far more typical in most of the bbq joints I ever visited. Now, cornbread with Texas chili? *That’s* more like it!
As a midwesterner person. i wish i had more brisket. can a texan drive up here cook me some brisket and il give you 500
Seeing British children experiencing actual flavor for the first time in their lives is heartwarming. 😊
what happened to the subtitles starting during the ad?
Sharing food brings us closer.
1:18 what are they feeding Mack lol! I think they've been country feeding that boy too compared to Vadim lmao!
Are you lying? He's not lying!
They need REAL Southern Black Americans to cook all the food they ate. I promise you little buddy would've think that way about cornbread.. they need to fly some real cooks out to show those kids how the South really does it.
Welcome to the present age! This is what real food with Spices, herbs, and rubs and FLAVOR looks like boys!
I cant wait to visit my bro in Oklahoma with his Hasty Bake grill. I think about those ribs all year.
🙏🏽🇺🇸
They need to try a BLACK BAR B QUE
im glad yall filled the tray with food
These kids are fantastic!!
U gave these kids American drugs from the bbq. Now they’ll never eat school food again 😂
How they hatin' on proper tea? That's wild. Sweet is the only way to drink tea!
@jolly y’all need to go and visit Grandad Joe, he is always after a new flavor! You should bring him Texas BBQ!!!! He’s game to try all of it, and he’d be so fun! A COOL CROSSOVER!!!♥️
Fair enough with the corn bread. What makes cornbread so amazing is when it’s heated up and lathered with butter. Once the butter melts, add some honey. Chefs kiss! 🧑‍🍳 💋
These videos just fill me with joy
This is making me salivate. Yum!
There really is no bbq better than Texas
I’m a Dallasite. I absolutely love watching them enjoy great Texas food!
Give em an Arnold Palmer
WAY TO GO, TEXAS BBQ from a native Noo Yawkuh!
It was that day these kids experienced their first meat comas.
And they say America has no culture!
Mountain dew has been banned in the countries that have smarts. Very toxic interaction of 2 chemicals,  i heard.
1:06 I know I can’t hit kids, but for calling a smoked brisket burned is a crime.
This is how I felt at Franklin BBQ in Austin, Texas. It was amazing! Also, it was adorable how they all immediately put the beans on their Texas toast ❤
If you are a southerner who has traveled to Europe, these kids told no lies. To say their food is bland, is too kind.
These kids will chance this food high for the rest of their lives.
300 years of Spice Trading... discovered flavor!
Wait til you try some grilled corn on the cob.
Big miss no smoke ring on that brisket 😢
That headmaster had himself a day!!!!!! Not going to top this jolly!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now ask them about the meat sweats.
Why do British high schoolers look like kindergarteners😭
I dont blame the south for being a bit bigger with food like texas bbq and Louisiana cajun 😅😅
I have never cared for cornbread. It's alright in a few applications, but I wouldn't want to eat cornbread by itself.
their vocab is so much better than most kids in america
In Texas, brisket is king. I love to see people's first taste and reaction when I cook. I've gotten pretty good at cooking brisket and I hope one day I can compete with the pro's. Wish me luck y'all.
12:01 I have never seen a British person that doesn’t like beans
Actually, you're supposed to put butter on the cornbread. That makes it better.
Sounds to me like the cornbread is too dry.  It needs to be sweet cornbread WITH Green Chiles
The headmaster eats everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If there is one major get together that Texas & some parts of the south is known for, its sourthen hospitality & oversize jaw dropping foods.
Who messed up the cornbread for baby Boris?
For the love of all that is holy, if you are going to give them cornbread, they have to have BUTTER AND HONEY!!!!!
3:35 is the purest form of excitement for pickles I have ever seen
12:57  I just realized, kid on the left, absolutely DEMOLISHED those dishes. I mean nothing left. His classmate was genuinely surprised 😂 All I've heard from him is sublime and lovely.
I'm American with a dad that lives in Texas & this bbq is looking delicious af. 🤤
Eating cornbread then taking a sip of milk or mixing the cornbread in a small cup of milk just made the cornbread texture taste better.  Yellow cornbread or adding some Splenda sugar in cornbread taste so good when my brother makes it.
British people being exposed to flavor is like cavemen witnessing fire for the first time
Mammoth Mountain tee shirt!  I skied there are a teenage.
When are you guys doing Jamaican/Carribean foods? I want to see the kids try some oxtails, jerk chicken, salt fish & ackee, and beef patties
Should've started out first with the sides and then move on to the main course.
They might not be from Texas, but they definitely know how to eat Brisket..
Where's the fried pickles and fried okra?? come on now 😂
I WANT I WANT
These kids know how to express themselves, and it's such a breathe of fresh air. Words cannot express it.
Regular corn bread never impresses anyone. You need the sweet butter style
When I saw the title I knew this was about to be a religious experience for them
it's wild! In the UK the "Headmaster" is the principal but in America the "Headmaster" is my gf
They are so well spoken
Texan here! Best episode! The bbq reactions are priceless !
I love watching these boys eat!  They are my favorite guests.   They are so honest and appreciative of new foods.  Keep them coming!
In true Southern tradition, "these children need to be fed", and you fed them! I hope proper BBQ continues to spread to the corners of the world.
Them not liking cornbread hurt my soul
“I don’t think I can live here anymore”
Well now that you've made them try Texas BBQ, they gotta try Louisiana seafood boil!!
"That's lovely" I love how classy they are. The kids are too cute. And the one explaining of the redistribution of flavor with the cornbread, such a class act. All their expressions are great lol   Now that Mac n cheese should have been prepared by somebody's auntie lol
We need an episode with the headmaster in America.  I love how he loves all of our food.
Put some butter and honey on that cornbread yummy
Pass ‘em some hot water cornbread.
Loved all their reactions but the beadmasters is always my favorite to see!
Harry is so adorable 😂😂😂
These boys are so funny !!! The headmaster too. Everyone eating and soooo happy.  Yes, you all can come and we will make sure none of you miss any Texas bbq!  Bring your stretchy pants!!! 😂😂😂
Should do a series of the high schoolers answering British questions and eating the hot ones' wings
That opening sequence! Crazyyy😂
It's Chewsday, Innit?
Bbq in the US has become more than cooking, it’s a work of artistry and perfection.
i love watching them just lean right into the goodness.
England is the birthplace of the industrial revolution, how do they not have a handle on smoking meat?
I ❤the way they are  reacting 😂
gotta give em some brown sugar bacon baked beans.
They should try sweet corn bread. It's amazing! Can you imagine these kids going home & asking for TX bbq day after day?
Have these children never eaten?
“The bark is the best part, you can eat it on its own” boy their worlds changed when they were introduced to seasoning Edit: side note, how you guys going to give them cornbread and tell them to put either butter or honey on it
there are two types of cornbread -corn cornbread -sweet cornbread both are served with honey drizzled on the top
Good for you for converting the British.
You need to bring some NY bagels and hot dogs 😂
YOU ARE VERY SMART LETTING THE OTHER KIDS TRYING THE FOOD FROM AMERICA LIKE Texas FOOD.😊😅😮😢🎉😂❤
I'm so curious about the logistics of setting this whole thing up.
Corn bread needs butter.
High school? These fuckers barely 14
holy vocab, these kids using sublime to describe food
This is why most Americans are plus sized, because our food is good. If I lived in the UK, I'd be skinny because your food is nasty. Laverbread, jellied eel, stargazy pie, winkles and marmite. 🤢🤮😵
We makethesamegreat B BQ in Tennessee, it isnt just in Texas!!!
It's worth noting to our UK friends that much of that platter isn't exclusive to either BBQ or Texas. Then best Brisket is usually done by Jewish deli's in New York, cornbread is an almost everywhere thing, ditto macaroni and cheese. Ribs are the same, an everywhere thing, but Texas is known for them more for the quantity and quality as a cattle state. You can find the same in Alberta Canada because they are a cattle province, you get the best where there is a large fresh local supply. But Texas, along with like Tennessee, stand out for their rubs and sauces. So just know that if you come visit north america you will be able to find quality BBQ in many places in both the US and Canada. But a cattle town will always have something a little special.
I have watched alot of videos of non Americans reacting to American foods, the one food that always gets the same reaction no matter where they are from, is Texas BBQ.        Most react like the kids did, some react like the headmaster, and I grin throughout it all.
Hello from Amarillo Texas! I loved this video guys!  I recommend finding a cornbread recipe with jalapeños in it!!  It is going to elevate the corn bread flavor and help keep a little bit of moisture in it.
Where's the Texas toast?
Not everyone makes  their cornbread bland 😂 some of us make it a little sweet
Poor kid is being possessed by fat and juice 😂
For God's sake, put some butter on the cornbread 😮😮
Nothing says love or hospitality like good old fashion like Texas BBQ God Bless Texas 🙌
13:43 well kid, first of all you didn’t have cornbread properly, secondly we’ll keep making tons of it thank you very much. Especially with BBQ, cornbread has to be hot/warm and slathered with butter, not cold and plain. Usually taking a bite of cornbread after a bite of brisket, followed with a forkful of pit beans, is absolutely delicious.
I see a whole bunch of guys who will be coming here to Texas one day! Y’all come on, we have cobbler for dessert!
My favorite videos are the kids and headmaster!!!❤❤❤
Taxas BBQ is pretty good but I like Memphis style best. They don't do everything better but the ribs are outta this world.
They’ve never had real food lol.
Canadian here the only thing i didn't like in this video was the the as you shoved down my throat i hate video's like that no one should be forced to watch an ad this is not cable TV. Leave that crap for the end so if they want to watch it they can or put in a time stamp so a person can skip more easily but don't shove an ad down people's throat's.
That's my weekend meat lasts me all week . I spice the huddy smokes .
The Headmaster is acting like he died and went to food heaven
2:42
You better warn them about meat sweats.
You need a little cornbread with your butter! No way could I eat dry cornbread and I’m Southern born and raised.
I sense a meat coma coming on🤣
OH my goodness, never disappoints!  That was AWESOME! LOL!
Shouldve plopped done some watermelon, fried chicken, and grape drank. No reason, but American food for these English kids to try.
When they put the beans in the bread. LOL.
Imma make SO MUCH cornbread and enjoy it more now lol But this was a great video, glad they got to experience some Texas barbecue!
9:10 couldn’t have said it better myself
been alive 5 decades and never knew it was called a Texas fold. Thought it was just a sandwich
11:49 "It looks terrible." SON, YOU GUYS EAT STRAIGHT HEINZ CANNED BEANS, YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT LOOKS TERRIBLE!
the captions are wildly off after the promotion
Texan here! The cornbread should be served hot and fresh! Also, it should be MOIST, like a great cake. It looks like the one they got was pretty dry! It will also have some sugar in it. It can be eaten all by itself, or can be mixed in with the beans. Also, the tea is a GLASS of iced tea, served cold and sweet, as it is southern. Having sugar in the tea back then was a sign of wealth!
Idk how much you make off these vids but you need to bring the principal with you on a trip. Hit philly cheese steaks and pizza then Texas bbq
Awesome responses! Fun to watch, thank you for sharing.
Proud Texan here.  I do love our BBQ ❤❤❤❤❤.
to be fair, cornbread isn't really bbq bread, dinner rolls are better with bbq. and I don't like mac and cheese either, sometimes our sweet iced tea is too sweet. only in the last fifteen years did restaurants here start over sweetening our tea. i like it stronger flavored as well. beef ribs need a wet glaze to taste their best, but texas likes them dry.
As a Texan who has a dad who makes great bbq I don’t believe how so many people have never had Texas bbq
From midwest; The beans and mac actually don't look that good. The meat looks 🎉
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore" really hit home. If I'm at a steakhouse I order fried chicken tenders. There's no reason to be disappointed by the meat. We do it better in our back yard around here.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
C’mon kid. There’s many, many different recipes for cornbread. You had one.
Why are these videos so fun. Watching  there reaction is pricless
What is day-tah?
That cornbread looked dry and bland.
I am a native Texan BBQ is our love language. We take it quite seriously.
This was so fun to watch
As a texan this makes me giddy lol
Heat up the cornbread and add butter for god's sake! I'm not a huge fan of cornbread and I totally anticipated they wouldn't like it.
You eat pinto beans on cornbread with bean juice.
How many times did they say “no wonder Americans are so fat?” 😂
I love these videos. In America I guess we tend to forget our food is outrageously over the top sometimes compared to other countries. I watched a video of Korean girls trying pizza for the first time. At one point, there was no one speaking for minutes. They were lost in the moment and shook to their core. LOL but true.
Why so many blacks in Britain
What do you mean the UK doesn’t have patience to wait 16 hrs.  We literally watch cricket for 5 days and perfectly fine with no result after all of that lol!
Sweet Baby Ray and the Sorcerer's Meat
Get them some bojangles
Try steak biscuits
Born and Bred Texan here!  Plus let the world know our BBQ is the best hands down!
Sending Love from Texas ❤🤍💙
Wisconsinite here. I truly love watching people enjoy new tastes and flavors. Proper young gentleman here.
“We can tell you two have never eaten ribs” - meanwhile they got scolded for trying to eat ribs with a fork before
Straight up destroyed their ability to ever have a good meal again. Nothing will ever compare.
Everything is bigger in Texas!  Don’t mess with Texas!
I lived in the UK.  Their sausages are mushy, wish soft mushy skin.
Are all British students boys?
would love to see the smoker you used for the meat
Can you please try Saudi food? Big love from KSA😄🇸🇦
this reminds me of the snake getting given gatorade
Now you understand why the southern states of the US are the unhealthiest people on the planet.
i love how they feel so american from eatting the bbq they barely touch their tea
As an American, yes, I concur, the cornbread is nasty.  I've never understood the appeal.
British kids have the most adorable voices lmao
Nobody ever said Texas fold ever
Human documentary: 😁 Cow documentary: 😱
lol thus is so darling
I’m American and I also don’t like crusty Mac n cheese. It’s blasphemous but it’s blue box or nothing for me.
9:50 beef is the most common sausage in America because it was mainly Jewish immigrants from Germany that popularized sausages and hotdogs and Jews dont eat pork.
That cornbread did look a little dry, like there was no butter mixed in or added on top, but everything else looked really good.
These never get old! And the headmaster is the best!!!
Not me sitting here in Texas eating grocery store sushi rolls for dinner, envying the heck out of these students!  Do you finally crush them with how much that tray of goodness usually runs?  Easily $25. 😢
Merica.
My other half is from North Carolina. He took me to his sisters wedding and they catered bbq. NC bbq is so different but so good
Meat Is So Big That The National Anthem Plays😂
Where's the butter or honey on the cornbread? I don't know anyone that eats cornbread by itself! lol Either you gotta dip it in some chili or slab some butter on that!
So what are these kids eating out in England??!
Try the cornbread warmed up with butter and honey. It will change your life.
Those black kids are having an American Black moment...LOL
I love sweet tea!! I just made some! As a southern, it's awesome seeing people enjoy good food! 💚💚
If there's one good thing about the Slave Trade to the Americas it's the fact they brought pit smoking and roasting over with them.
And they wonder why Americans are fat....LOL SMH
Barbecue is tasty but I can barely eat it because the smokiness tears my stomach up something fierce.
I live in Kentucky and brisket is my favorite. It makes me smile to see this.
Zadok the Priest playing when you show the brisket was a stroke of genius for your editors.
Yes, this is one reason why we Americans have the highest number of heavy people, it's because we can make some great food y'all. :)  Gotta say it's so nice to hear the sighs and mmmmms from the kids and headmaster. You can tell they absolutely love it.
Im american and I agree kiddo cornbread is NASTY!!😂😂
You forgot to put butter and honey on the cornbread for them.
11:13 he's down for everything.😅
This made my heart happy!
I wish they would have included butter and honey with the cornbread. I'd rather eat that then cake!
Southern food influence will always be the best
Bravo!  👏👏👏
So basically I’ve interpreted this as the headmaster needs a southern black America wife.
Texas Ribs: “They not like us!”
welcome to texas
Honestly the cornbread didn't look too appetizing 🤷🏽‍♀️
I understand the negative sentiment about cornbread, but like many things there are lots of different ways to make it.  If you find a particular piece of cornbread to be too dry, look around and you'll probably see butter nearby. Just slather some on and you'll be good to go 👍
Never seen anyone eat baked beans with bread like that. Is that a British thing?
Now I know why there are so many Brit's here in Texas LOL
It seems like you didn’t serve butter with that cornbread. Or honey. Nobody wants dry cornbread. Maybe that’s why they didn’t like it.
Please bring headmaster Dave to Texas!
We Texans are proud of our barbecue. Watching the kids and the headmaster was awesome. True appreciation for a national treasure.
And now you know why we have a weight problem lol
Brisket is generally a cheap meat.  I've bought it for like $1 per pound.  Then I slow cook it in the smoker.  Get tons of meals out just $15.
American here, it’s ok I’ve never been a fan of corn bread either.
I just did the pledge of allegiance.
Cracking up
The black kid is not British.
I don’t think I can eat food here anymore 😂
Definitely not vegan lol, that's what im talking about
Honorary Yanks for the day!!!😊
They just abuse British people with bland food
Is that sweet tea they are drinking?
I love it when that boy exclaimed “I don’t know if I can eat anything here anymore” 😂.
Cornbread deserves generous butter and a sprinkle of sugar. Soak up the meat juice or my personal favorite, add honey and eat by itself
2:43  bro gone have an accident 😂 chill!!
I am glad they enjoyed it. It's better than a cup of eels, isn't it?
I love the oohing and the aahing! The way to a mans heart is through his stomach 🤣 . What have you done to these poor boys and man! They'll be saving to visit Texas ASAP 😂
I love seeing how much everyone loves eating bbq just as much as i do! Im convinced its gotta be the best food in the world! Maybe i need to come to the UK and open up a bbq joint 😊
Who’s the n******
Put whipped honey butter on warm cornbread and they would 100% change their tune.
10:36  "I don't think I can eat food here anymore" 😂
I was supposed to go to a steakhouse for Father's Day but forgot all about it. So now that I've seen this video, I'm going to go get BBQ instead. It's been far too long and I keep forgetting is there. How? I don't know!! But I'm going now, I can tell you that!!  I'm so looking forward to getting a lawyer amount of BBQ, sides, and tearing it up.   That boy got it right, go big or go home!
Cornbread requires butter.
I get teary-eyed when I see Europeans compliment American food rather than tearing it down.
Probably a nice change after eating boiled meat all their life.
Yum! Texas BBQ is the best! Absolutely loved their reactions!
I wish they had given them Texas soul food mac-n-cheese.
8:19 gotta go for the northern style cornbread not the southern style
Southern girl here, so beyond happy that these lovely gents enjoy & appreciate this delicacy ❤ If possible, I would have BBQ brisket for my last meal yummmmmm
Rice bread is better than corn bread, in my opinion. Better texture
Born and raised in Texas. I had my first bite of Texas BBQ was when I was 1. I love that they're old enough to remember this moment and it's so life changing for them. I love this video.
What? No "smashing"? 😋
The look of disbelief, disappointment, and disgust at the "i dont like the crispy bits" on the mac and cheese 😂😂
"I dont think anybody has the patience in the uk" ik bud ive seen "cheesy chips" from a futbol game vendor
"why don't we have this in the UK?"  Because you steal other people's food instead of coming up with your own. And when you do, it's beans on toast. 💀
How fabulous to hear these young men use words like "lovely", "sublime", "mesmerizing", "cozy", "nice", "redisperses", "another level", "texture", "comprehending".  What a delight to watch! 💜
Tamale pie with cornbread depends on who makes it. Should be really good
Seeing Dave again makes me happier than you can imagine.  WTG Jolly!
Does England not have pickles???
*FIRST OFF, THAT WAS NOT REAL, AUTHENTIC, CORNBREAD.*  You have to come get it from the *TRUE, ORIGINAL, OG Cooks,* here in *Louisiana.* Hell, even *Mississippi!*   To judge that travesty that was forced upon them as a culinary fail is like getting some *”blood sausage “* or whatever *British food staple* from over here, in the frozen section of a grocery store, from some generic frozen food supplier, that *CLAIMS* to have the authentic dish and it tastes better than the real over there in *Britain.* 🤦🏾‍♀️🤭🤷🏾‍♀️✊🏾💪🏾🩵💯
You're going to cause them to become fat and have heart disease.
I just love this!!! Question: Did all (student body, like when they had Korean fried chicken)the kids get to try the BBQ?
Put honey on the corn bread .
Cornbread must have been a bad recipe, or no butter provided. Only possible explanation.
During covid I only went out of lockdown to get BBQ 😅
Mammoth Mountian! One of my favorite mountains to board on 🤘
I love these boys!  They are so cute!  ❤
I'm a Texan. I'm so glad you guys included the slice of white bread!
Segragated also just like the south intended
I mean, do they even have butter on that cornbread?
Jolly, you should have given them butter and honey on the corn bread. We eat it as an ending to the meal.
If they ever come to Texas, make sure they get brought to any of the smokehouses in Fort Worth, that city was built on that stuff thanks to the Stockyards
I knew they wouldn’t like that cornbread as soon as I seen it. It needs to be a sweet version like Bob Evan’s, hot and slathered in real butter. They would’ve loved it.
They should have had them put real butter on the corn bread to take away any dryness and where was the corn on the cob
Let me fix that cornbread for you with some warm butter and honey. I'll change their mind. ❤
Too much flavor and texture on the mac for them is wild 😂. Mac should be cheesy asf, and crunchy texture adds a lot of goodness to the mac
captions are really delayed but great vid
You need to put butter on the corn bread
Curly haired kid looks like Jojo Rabbit
That first kid just shoved the brisket into his mouth-- no bites here! 😆
Where are girls ??
LOL, I feel sorry for these kids Moms after this.  Everything will be bland and heavy sighs for awhile, lol.
Glad the Poms approve 👍🇺🇸
How to turn Brits into Americans in 5 seconds. xD
Now they will learn what REAL good food looks like....instead of the slop they usually eat in the UK.😏
I didn't even realize how hungry I am 🤣
The cornbread needs butter.
I want to attend this school.
I very much enjoy watching these “Brit’s” try our food
That one kid chose VIOLENCE at the end there.
You gotta take the sausage and wrap a piece of bread around it then give it a shot of mustard. Thats how we always did it in Texas. My family always called it a "wrap-around"
And some of them really think their food is better than ours 😭😭
Their poor little palates were overwhelmed 😂
these kids are understanding that while they dont live as long as the rest of americans, those folks live a very full and fun life with great food
I appreciate these people for always trying something new.
that wasn't proper cornbread it was too dry
East Texas man here. You boys enjoy that and come for a visit  ya hear? Yahoo! 🤠🤠
I don't like cornbread and I'm from Texas 😂
It's definitely yt people cornbread.
They're all wearing suits for school and actually used the word sublime. Compared to students here in the US, that impressed me more than anything.
Don’t they feed children in the UK?
You sure this was safe to film during the "heat wave" that's melting London? 🤣🤣
So you must tell us Texans WHERE this bbq came from. If it's not in the Texas Monthly top 10, you've done them a disservice. If they're that amazed at some chain bbq like Dickey's, wait until they get a bite of Evie Mae's Wolfforth or Coopers Llano.
They need to try a bbq sandwich with some cracklin on it
That headmaster is looking on Zillow for a place in TX after this 😂
Terry blacks?
I just wanna move to the UK and start a restaurant 🤣🤣🤣
its really hard to beat good southern texas bbq.
Southern American here and while all Americans do BBQ the best BBQ is in the Southern states.
you should bring their mothers and fathers into try it with them
Young man, cornbread is one of the best things ever, i am southern though lol
They all saw the face of God after that first bite.
…You have to have jalapeño cornbread and you slather it with butter. I’m Tex-Mex from Austin, so I know!
As a Texan... I absolutely LOVE these kids enjoying some of our best cuisine to offer!! BBQ is more than food... It's a WAY OF LIFE!!
cool video, help me understand. is this a public school or a private school in the u.k?   they seem so proper.
Harry was the best. He called the brisket "lovely".😂😂
I mean we're trying over here but there's a reason why we're all obese
you gotta have the cornbread HOT with honey and butter
Y'all need to try some North Carolina BBQ too. Thanks fellas.
There’s several variances of barbecue across the United States, It’s kind of like religion.  And you don’t always talk about it.  Was the cornbread, sweet or unsweet?  Also throw some butter on it.
Now imagine if they had it all cooked by Southern blk people. 🤌🏿🤌🏿🤌🏿
Who made that cornbread 🤔  😂😂😂😂😂!?
Nah! Who made that Cornbread? 😂 They need to come and eat at my house.
best comment "it's absolutely sublime" nail on the head. a really heartwarming video big food hugs from the USA
You don't put slaw on a sandwich. Only people who are trying to be trendy do that.
That's not real mac n cheese if you know what I mean, goes for the cornbread too
I cant get over how many dont like mac n cheese!!! Makes me so sad
It would be interesting to see how many of these kids grow up and end up opening a restaurant in the UK with foods from around the world 🎉
Put some butter on the cornbread!
My pork shoulder takes 10 to 14 hours and is neighborhood Famous! 😎 The neighbors can smell it for hours and start "showing up" around dinner time! 😁 Never turned anyone away yet! Yes, I'm pretty popular around here. Lol
I agree on the tea.  As a born and bred Southerner I HATE sweet tea.
"What age can You legally move to America?" 😅
it's so comforting to see people enjoying food from other cultures, this is the kind of positive thing i need to watch at the end of a long day
Waiting for that comment but they don’t think they can eat the food there anymore😅
I was raised on Tx BBQ. This video is making my mouth watering 🤤
Them fighting words. I love cornbread
Y'all gave them cornbread with *no honey.*  Pretty sure that's child abuse.
They made the cornbread too dry.  Cornbread should be moist buttery and sweet.
I love how they get American BBQ and immediately forget the knife and fork… 😂 that’s how it’s done!
Mum and dud sign me up for tasties!
Sweet, moist cornbread is where it's at, not that dry, bland 💩
they dont like cornbread smh
And British people wonder why Americans think their food sucks… because it kinda does..
This is how you eat like Kings and Queens ❤🎉
The food is so good but also one of the reasons why America is so fat😅
At 7:16 I couldn't watch this anymore. I've just had dinner, and now I'M HUNGRY AGAIN!
Get them some better cornbread... we all saw how dry that was 😂
Y’all have made it infinitely harder for these babies parents to feed them! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Cuz how you gon top Smoked Brisket?????
As someone from Oregon I love that they can enjoy our food 😍
Ruining British people 1 meal at a time 😂
Had they put some African American southern soul food sides, it would’ve been PERFECT!
I love that both the black kids and the white kids talk a like and no ghetto language
British food is bland. I’m enjoying watching them have flavor.
I’m an Arab American who was born overseas but has lived in the US since I was a kid. I was also in the US Army so I’ve met different people from a lot of different places, and I must say that Southern Food in general can be put up against any fancy shmancy food from anywhere. There’s nothing like eating BBQ that’s so good you don’t even notice that your entire face and hands are covered in sauce and grease 😂 we gotta put more respect on American Food in general
I felt that I’m still comprehending the flavors 😂
Southerner here. I'm not usually a very patriotic person, but nothing makes me prouder of my country than seeing our food enjoyed by others around the world. Really makes me appreciate what I take for granted here, especially culinarily.   Little note about the cornbread, there's ways in the recipe that you can make it turn out more like a sponge cake with a lot richer flavor. Cornbread is one of those dishes that's really easy to mess up, and usually it takes a lot of trial and error to nail the flavor and consistency.
I work at one of the most famous small, family owned barbecue restaurants in the United States.  People come to our lirrle old shack from all over the globe.;  from Africa to Ireland, Indonesia to Mexico, our food is legit.  I wish these kids had tried pulled pork as well.  Ours is marvelous.  Also, something must have gone wrong with that cornbread (it happens) because the cornbread I am used to is utterly gorgeous.  I am sure those boys would have loved it.  Also, burnt ends or brisket tips;  fatty, juicy chunks of beef that melt in your mouth.  They're SO good!  Smoked chicken is also amazing.  Collard greens.  Btw, I rarely use sauce.  The meats are so lovely they do not need it.  Now I am craving barbecue even though I have unlimited access to it.  There is a lot of excellent food in the United States.  Side note:  I can not stand baked or barbecued beans.  I adore beans I'm a multitude of ways, but bot baked or barbecued.
The pomp and circumstance coming in with the beef rib is amazing. Well done boys.  Poor kids will never think of “mums dinna” the same
I want to know who made the bbq or at least watch the process. I’m certain it would be certified don’t get me wrong.
I love the reaction from each and every one of you.
Gimme
I love seeing people try and love southern food for the first time!
I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING I KNOW....THE ALGORITHM IS TROLLING MY HUNGER!!!
And that’s how I met your mother!!😂
MURICA🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I best every one of those boys slept for 13 hours after that meal hahaha
Born in and lived my entire life in Texas. Welcome to Heaven on Earth,
i am starving now
Right when the world needed these kids the most
But where’s the smoke ring on that brisket???
Texas in the house boys we know our BBQ
Do you not have pickles in the UK?????
How do they get it over there fresh enough not to be nasty?  I mean reheated is no where near as good as fresh.  Also you didn't give them anything to put on the cornbread,  I love butter and black raspberry jam but many do butter and honey.
God bless living in Texas
From Texas, what a great video.
These young men are 9 they look 16ish.  Edit year 9 my bad
Europe is so deprived. Bahahahaha!!!!!!!
How did you pull off Texas BBQ in Englad? Did you fly someone out there to smoke it?
You KNOW this Headmaster will Always.......allow them into his school.
Cornbread is supposed to be made with Cream Corn added to moisten it.
The old way it’s so much better.
You know that cornbread was likely had no sweetness nor any butter.  Straight bland.  They did those kids an injustice!  Someone get them some REAL cornbread.
That’s because the skin is pig casing.
It's always nice to see foreigners try foods from other countries. Foods we've never tried before can be really delicious at first taste
You didn't put butter and honey on the cornbread ! We dont eat it plain. Even if we are dipping it in something we slathering in butter and I like honey on mine.  Blasphemous.  I AM from Texas, and lived in New Orleans for years, I know southern food.
You have to leave the Headmaster behind. I'm afraid for his wellbeing!
🇺🇸
American here. I also agree that breadcrumbs on Mac and cheese is unnecessary. Iykyk
I can taste the freedom. It damn near brings a tear to my eye
I live in WA state and I have never had Texas BBQ. I'm happy for you, sad for me.
Make that one boy an honorary citizen and get him a trip over here.
Dude this episode put a smile on my face bro make me proud to be a texan 🤠
The violence of letting them taste this, years before they ever have it again, yall are evil
The younger ones just MURDERED everything in front of them!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 You know they're gonna BEG their parents to go to America! 😂😂😂😂
You can get BBQ anywhere in the US no matter where you visit. Americans grew up eating this in the backyard.
You should have them try a seafood boil and gumbo.
I bet our BBQ beats bangers and mash ANY DAY!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Those kids will never enjoy beans on toast again.
I guarantee everyone involved went into a food coma when they went home! 😂😂😂😂😂
Love our cousins across the pond.
3:43 its shows the change in a year
As a world traveler, America does BBQ in their own distrint way and it rocks.
Bring sweet little baby Harry, he is adorable!
These kids are adorable!! So p9lite and hilarious too!!!!
See??? Blacks all over the WORLD LOVE BBQ!!!! It must be in their dna!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a Texan I'm just over here smiling like a proud mama.😊
I have to say I don't like most people's/restaurants corn bread, way to dry and plain. I make mine sweet with honey and I cook it for a shorter time so that it is moist and doesn't dry your mouth out like a desert.
And now the world knows why America is fat.
Getting emotional is the proper response...
great  seeing British children actually eat flavorful things
How did you get it there!??
Lot of napkins will be needed.
It’s wild, a country that enslaved half the world for their spices and refuses to use spices in their food 😂😂😂😂 yall still eating like the Luftwaffe is still overhead
My goodness these kids are by far the CUTEST and so wholesome! I cannot even handle it!
Ollie wearing the Mammoth Mountain shirt is sending me 🥹 We went there for spring skiing in t-shirts and shorts! Such a fantastic place when I was young.   Always love the young guys tasting these foods, had me some beef ribs tonight!
What happened to the Texas toast?
You KNOW they slept good after this
CORNBREAD NEEDS TO BE WARM WITH LOTS OF BUTTER AND HONEY.
How south east asian feels everytime anu white people tried their cuisine😂
Yeah....that's how the big southern boys eat!😂
The grown man eating the barbecue is the funniest.💯
Okay kick them out not liking Mac and cheese remove them now lol
the brisket should've been cooked a bit longer I can tell from the grains being too tight on the lean end, but overall looks amazing
I'm obsessed with the "that's lovely" kid 😂❤
Eww using Ai images
And Brits try to say their food is better than American food? You'll never ever see anyone from another country rave about food in the UK like these kids are about American bbq.
My God these poor British kids 😂this is the first time they tried food with flavor...come to America young lads we will feed you until you pop 😂 🇺🇸
Do the teachers get to enjoy some this goodness?
Have they ever had Primantis Brothers aka a Pittsburgh sandwich?
2:43 lil homie had an outer body experience!!!! 😂
Corn bread kid doesn’t need to go to the South
I had no idea that Brits don’t have pickles! I didn’t think that they were that “American”…?! …They need to try FRIED pickles!! Yum
No more canned beans for these guys😂
Damn that kid wants to get the whole south pissed off at him at once. Telling them to never make cornbread again.
I am from Texas and I would love to be able to send a care package from buc-ee's to you guys if you guys would ever want that
They're going to be chasing that dragon for the rest of their lives.
They are ready for a food coma eating like that
I’ve lived in Texas (Houston, Dallas and mostly San Antonio)  since 1979 and I’ve never heard of a Texas fold.  That was a beautiful brisket. I personally don’t like fat on anything but I’ve seen people ask for extra fatty meat while I ask for the leanest slices.  It gave me a great sense of pride to see them enjoy the food so much. The corn bread should have some soft honey butter with it. I cut the skin off of sausage or skinless sausage.
Houstonian here.   Had colleagues from different European countries attend a work conference in the Houston area.   I took the 5 of them to different local restaurants for Tex-Mex, seafood/steak, and BBQ.   They collectively agreed that the BBQ was the best thing they’d ever eaten.   We had dinner at different BBQ joints for the next 3 nights.   Word got out in our EU office and I became the unofficial dinner host for my remaining time with the company.  It’s almost unbelievable that I made lifelong friends over dinner at local BBQ restaurants.   Good times.  Great memories.
Quick question does it beat beans and toast
And now everything mom cooks is trash. 😅😅
You all will sleep with a full tummy
I live in Eugene, Or., and there is now bbq here. There is no fried chicken except KFC.. Fkg hippies, tofu and korean tacos. Wtf. Damn hippi
"Are you lying?...He's not lying" 😆😆😆😆
THIS IS WHY NORTH AMERICANS ARE GENERALLY FATTEST
unfortunately if they did this with American kids there would be a never ending stream of "bro" "fire" "dope" and "bussin" instead of " lovely" and "sublime".
Of course the Kaffir loved the bbq. 😂😂😂😂
now I bet theyre really glad they lost that war
Bruh. British kids are deprived with all the Bland food theyre fed. Beans on Toast is as bland as it gets and should be illegal in all countries. BBQ baked Beans are so good 😋
That cornbread did look super dry lol
Don't forget to lick your fingers clean
I can see why you have young men tasting these foods from bbq land-they cram so much food in their mouths and are so joyfully chewing and enjoying these meats. It's a joy to watch them go at it. And the headmaster is right there with his students! Yeah!
I've eaten all over the world. British food is garbage.
UK government says American beef and pork is garbage!
Enjoy young men the meat will fall off the bone easily.
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen! They're so excited and so honest with their initial reactions to everything
Im sorry but there's no way "Mack" is 9 years old 😂 That boy looks 15 lol
Probably a coincidence you had the black kid stuffing his face with a half rack, lmao.
Dont be surprised if a bunch of British folks start showing up in texas 😂
Any kid that doesnt like Mac n Cheese simply had a terrible childhood LoL
Such fun to watch these boys enjoy Southern cuisine! Brits just don't understand Texas BBQ. The movers who took our large grill off the truck had never seen anything like it. When we lived there, you couldn't even  buy charcoal in the winter! (We quickly learned to stock up for the winter so we could grill year-round.)
cornbread needs some butter!
They really need Creole Cornbread to go with that!  That's a lot of Texas food converts there!  🇨🇱🇨🇱
These kids are now ruined for British food 😂
Idk if anyone has seen those 2 middle Eastern guys food channel?! They absolutely loved the Texas BBQ! They are funny too. I love watching foreigners eat American BBQ. It's probably the one type of food that we didn't borrow from another culture.
Had to click on this one. I knew the reactions would be off the chain 😂😂😂 Yexas bbq is some good stuff. Cant imagine what was going through their minds when they started getting hit with all the smells before they actually got to try it...
I needed a laugh today, I love the British, they have made me laugh today. America is use to barbeque. Have a blessed week. Thanks for sharing!!!
Your sick !! And people  like you  are so sad  I feel so  sorry for you
You don't eat cornbread by itself, Brits love beans, slap some of that cornbread in some real beans and then slob some butter on top and thank me later. Real beans, not those tomato ones you things ear. Some october beans or pinto beans. Damn, I'm gonna go make some right now.
You can tell your  racist  you made sure you put the barbecue  in the  black kid's  mouth !!!!
omg i hate sweet tea. with all that delicious sodium loaded food and then all that sugar i get so dehydrated and more thirsty i always go unsweet tea or lemonade.
This was a delight to watch 😊
The corn bread is my favorite part of a BBQ plate. We like to break it all up and mix in some Red Beans and rice and then take a big spoon full after a bite of Meat! But TBH I'm not sure this cornbread was properly made bc I've NEVER had bland Cornbread. The secret is to add maybe a ½ cup of cream of corn to the batter to give it a bit of moisture and maybe a small can of green chilis 😋
You gotta throw some butter on that cornbread
Oh, that brisket...
You guys make the most wholesome content! I love it.  But at the same time, you may have ruined british food for these kids!
0:46
Welcome to Texas food, yummy!
Awesome, but you have to keep that rib on the bone so you can grab it and bite into it. Something primal about eating cooked meat off the bone. Also, no pickled jalapenos?
“That’s lovely”
To be fair, anything would please British folks. I mean they're top plates are fish and chips.
Gotta add some butter to that cornbread
where is the jalepeno!! js stuffed and bacon wrapped ... missed out on that one... lol maybe next time... but texas bbq is the best...
Meemaw would be proud of those young men.
God Bless Texas💜💥💥💥🏆🏆🏆   In my opinion they have THE BEST BBQ and Grill and Smoke IN THE WORLD.    YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!    You will forever miss it😢
I need to take the afternoon off…. FOOD COMA !!!
I would invite them over for some barbeque, but I'm not sure with the current state of the world that would be a good idea 😅
Food coma !!!😂
What kind of freak eats barbecue beans on bread?
Can you guys react to Worst places to Live by Degenerocity
You gotta butter that corn bread!
How do the logistics work?  Do you order the food from America, then cook it???  I just LOVE YOUR  content!
Remember when all your European friends start talking trash about fat American people... This is why.
Give them California bbq we different 💯🔥🔥🔥
Those better not be paper straws being served with TEXAS BBQ!!!
I am a native Texan, and our BBQ brisket is the best! BBQ chicken and turkey  and BBQ beef sausage are also delicious!! I can't go with the pork at all, however. As for a side, I'll take BBQ pinto beans over mac & cheese any day! For dessert I'll take freshly made banana pudding! Sweet iced tea is gross. I only like unsweetened iced tea.
great video How do/did you guys get that in England??
Someone definitely needs to open a southern bbq place in London
I'm absolutely stuffed from supper, but now I'm starving for BBQ.
Texan here.  I literally am watching this as I am smoking sausage and ribs.
sad thing is most american food isnt even REAL food!!!  its lab made, GMO junk! pumped with hormone's for larger size and taste  and added mind altering hormornes as well  Im american but our food is def the WORST of all countries  because its nothing near natural!!!
Don't discount the cornbread. Chances are you ate from a boxed mix. Homemade cornbread is so much better & can be changed to fit your tastes. I make it homemade with corn in the mix & baked in a cornbread dusted cast iron skillet. It gets crunchy on the top & bottom. It's denser than a boxed mix & can carry a meal all on its own. Yum!
Don’t put on the CC. It’s waaaaaaaay off. You’ll get a headache.
Do you primitives not have proper dishes to eat from? Never mind.
OMG! I'M GETTING SOOO HUNGRY! 😂
Welcome to America !  That'll be $29.95 !
It occurred to me after watching this and all the other videos with y'all trying American food, especially southern cooking, that if someone wanted to make a fortune all they'd need to do is bring southern food to y'all. And I'm absolutely willing to be the one to move there and open a restaurant 😂😂😂
As a Texan, this was great to watch XD
One of the most memorable happenings when I travel is trying new food (included traveling in Europe as a child). Some is wonderful, some isn't, it's all an adventure. Delighted to watch these that this children get to try food not "native" to their country. Well Done!!
You done them boys wrong on that bread. It's supposed to be heavily buttered and griddled till toasty brown.
Next time we’re shipping these kids to Texas for a fresh homemade experience 😂
Just a bunch of dudes, grabbing at juicy smoked meat with their hands……eating like our ancestors did. That’s what it’s all about.
I love Ollie’s shirt, so retro. I remember people wearing Mammoth Mountain T-shirts in high school in the 80’s.
The American south have battles over who has the best BBQ. Everywhere has a different flavor but the heavies hitters, are Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Missouri, and Georgia. The crazy part is you can like BBQ and none of those states can appeal to you. You might like North Carolina, Florida, or even Arkansas. The point I'm trying to make is, Southern BBQ AIN'T NO JOKE! You really don't know BBQ until you've had all the southern states.
this food actually orgasmic
They all took a much needed nap after all that good carnage
You are supposed to put lots of butter on your cornbread!!
I’m starving for some barbecue right now! 🤤
I LOVE the shows with the ahead master and students!!  Their descriptions are lovely!
I wish all British people could. eat as well as Americans. I feel so sorry for these children they got to go back to that bland British food.🤨😉🤣😋 When they get old enough to come to the United States they're coming just to eat the food.
You need to put butter and honey on the cornbread.
As a mamma from Texas, this makes me so happy! These babies are eating it up! ❤
White shirts with lon 13:48 g sleeves doing barbecue? Thats confidence!
I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Brit teens experience American food!! Those boys are adorable!
As a southerner i definitely don’t like cornbread either i havent found anyones that i actually like
Can they just send me some through the phone😂🤤😋every bit of that wow
Are they all drinking Arnold Palmers?😂🤣
For the cornbread you want to make it spicy cornbread instead of plain when eating with BBQ. Put some jalapeños in it next time and it will be a smash hit.
I'm in America and still jealous! Brisket is Hella expensive!
Those boys will never be the same😂
Can you send the headmaster and the boys on a foodie trip around america? Southern food is supreme and so many other options as well as specialities from around the country
I loved everything 😂❤ My boys are special in my heart ❤
Only about half of these kids are British.
I 100% agree about the cornbread. It is always too dry for me.  Now I want to go out and get some BBQ.
I'm sorry but only a Brit would put beans on bread
They didn’t put butter on the corn bread 😭😭😭 I swear that would have sold them
I visited London once. I ate at a fish and chips shop and saw Spotted Dick on the menu. I ordered it for dessert, just so I could later tell people that I once ate a "spotted dick!" LOL!!!
Now yall see why we're all fat!
The respect they have is serial! God bless AMERICA!
I love that 98% of their first reaction with the beans are to _put it on toast!_
Get those kids some pinto beans then the cornbread will make since
Too bad they didn't film the after meat coma!!!
American BBQ is diverse depending where it's from but every one of them is delish! My fav is BBQ beef ribs.
Do british people not eat pickles much?
If you haven't had mac and cheese made with longhorn cheese from Dutch country, you are eating an inferior product, and I'm sorry this was the way the knowledge had to find you
Lol I love it, made me laugh and makes me want to open a BBQ place in Britain
You have to have honey with cornbread. Either just normal honey or honey butter so it melts. It's just not quite rigth without it!
🎉Every TX person rejoices! We love that you love it!!!
"Absolutely sublime!" 😊
These were British children are delight, very intelligent and has a very good sense of humor and they are really enjoying the barbecue❤❤
so Brits like runny mac and cheese, hate southern style beans with brisket and absolutely hate cornbread. Honestly cornbread is only good if it's sweet or as part of another dish like cornbread dressing, or cornbread and buttermilk or corn pudding casserole.
And this is how we Americans do food.
american BBQ is the best lol
You need to get these guys jalapeño cheddar cornbread, made with sour cream. Full of flavor and tang
Texan here! I still remember the best brisket I’ve ever had all the way back in time during Easter 2008.😊
Barbeque from the land of the and the brave
I'm an American so I feel free to say no wonder Americans are often overweight. LOL! Great reactions! Fun to watch!
Native Texan here. What the heck is a Texas Fold?
To be honest…that was some dry-looking cornbread lol All cornbread is not so dry or bland
This is better than canned beans on crusty bread!
Texan here, cornbread is either really good, or really bad.  And it's easy to screw up and make too dry.  Butter helps, imo Jalapenos helps as well.  They gave you pit beans, they're OK, they SHOULD have given you chili
Headmaster ready to abandon family and country for the bbq 😅
As a Texan, y’all did us proud
Kinda strange watching people eat something readily available in the states.  Gotta tip though. Let the corn bread sop up some of that rendered fat and juice.
Texan here! Bless your hearts bubbas, enjoy this good eatin!
This was such a great watch! I laughed so hard
I’m from Houston and I can tell you that some of the best BBQ brisket are cooked here😂😋
💕
Plain, presumably boxed, cornbread is pretty dry and bland. Either add some creamed corn to the recipe to moisten it up or drizzle honey on it.
As someone who grew up eating southern food, it’s hilarious to me to watch them put beans on the bread haha! I know that’s how they usually eat beans in the UK tho
I’m convinced they gave them some bland cornbread that ain’t good.
Aaaaaand I'm going for a sandwich at 2AM
Hell, Texan schoolkids would smile just as big if you slid that heaping tray in front of them.
I’m proud of them for hating on cornbread
Mudd and burst steakd9nt get any
They needed some corn souffle and banana pudding. :) The TX BBQ place here has red bliss potato salad, broccoli salad, and pimento cheese, too.
These kids are so polite, it’s amazing!
Not sure what kinda cornbread they gave the kids, but I can bet it wasnt honey cornbread
L it should be based in sauce.but not in TX.
These poor kids are doomed.  They're going to spend the rest of their lives comparing everything they will eat to everything they're eating, right here, at this moment....and they'll come up wanting more Texas BBQ.  Texas is open 24/7/365 and we love our British cousins.  Come visit us, y'all....and come HUNGRY!😃
American here! I'm SOOOOO Hungry !!
They sell Texas bbq in England? Hmmm
They forgot the bibs.
It's good but it's nothing like my mother's hand biscuit Brickle brackle and beans with fizzy wigets they used to make uh roasted ham
Making people eat Texas BBQ while wearing suits is diabolical lol!!
For those that said, the cornbread was "bland" you should try it with Honey butter which goes great with chili or maybe those pit beans. Or maybe makes the beans with the mac & cheese? I also like mac & cheese with ketchup
How do they get the food to the kids?
Imagine eating flavorless food ur whole life 😮‍💨
I’ve been in Texas my whole life and never wanted bbq more right now 😭😭 .. I’ve been taking it for granted
I feel like they would love a good sweet cornbread. It's my fav
How do they even have fresh cooked brisket in England, do they even have a smoker on the country?
That cornbread did look dry. I drench mine with melted butter mixed with honey right after I take it out of the oven. Makes a world of difference
I am sitting here so hungry, I cannot afford meat any longer, but I still love to watch the joy of others trying amazing meals from the USA (I'm Canadian)
Add sour cream to the cornbread
They won't be visiting the USA in 2025....and not likely 2026....hope the election gets here soon enough.
When you eat that much meat you end up with what we call meat sweats. I agree bread crumbs completely ruins Mac and Cheese. We have several kinds of cornbread but I like it with apple butter on it.
Legend has it, their flavors are still buffering.
Maybe if they would have put a little bit of butter on the cornbread it would taste better ? 🤷
Is there segregation in the UK? How come the school children are always filmed according to the color of their skin?
Cornbread needs to be served warm with butter.
Bring them to Kansas City
About time another one !
I love it when brits say food is lovely.   But they have no clue what good mac n chez is.
From Australia in Florida there's some badass food here 😂
Where do they get the food from? It looks really good but there's nothing that matches sitting down in Texas and eating it
Should have made that Honey Butter Cornbread
Southerner, living up North for the last 22 years. Recently went  back down to Virginia and  had some BBQ and the first bite made me burst into tears!!!
And that's why our obesity rates are so high my friends. The US is a melting pot of cultures, that means the food too. We've got everything. And BBQ is just so common here that seeing people eat American BBQ for the first time ever is so awesome! I'm just sitting here like, "Almost all of you have never had BBQ Pork Ribs? Huh?" 😂
13:00  As a born and raised Texan, I can 100% agree that is NOT southern tea.   Southern tea is a black tea and very dark.   That is crazy light colored and massively watered down.   Tea at my house always is dark enough to nearly be confused with a coke.   And the sweet part is always to taste and not excessive. For my family we all share in our sugar preference and will pre sweeten, but for guests we always give sugar and sugar substitute on the side with unsweetened black tea.   And sometimes we even drink in straight without sweeteners.   But always very dark.   Ours sets in the fridge overnight and is restirred the next morning.
Is there a market for BBQ in the UK?
Those pork ribs had nearly no meat on them?!
As a Freddie myself, I approve of Freddie's reaction to all of it. Love the british students getting a taste of life changing, world class BBQ. Come take a trip to the Midwest, lads. I promise you there's plenty more aside from Texas' world class BBQ  Cheers!
Black Americans make baked beans and Mac and cheese better. We don't use bread crumbs, that's a cardinal sin.
there's 2 kinds of BBQ.  (1) Texas BBQ and (2) good for you for trying.
If the cornbread was bland and dry, they didn’t make it right.
It's your inner carnivore coming out, we have all been there.
“I don’t think I can eat food here anymore” 😂
As a Texan, I'm smiling and enjoying the fact that they all enjoyed the BBQ.  It's a standard weekend thing for me.
Oh, young man... now is not the time to move to America.
honestly curious why we never get girl students in these episodes
One of the kids: We traded all of this away?
Yall made this bbq eatin American VERY HUNGRY!😭😭😭😭 now yall see why we got big backs!😂😭😭😭 our food be FOODING!!
I feel so spoiled now...I live in Texas & can literally get this everyday if I want it, along with soul food, burgers , fried fish, etc.... glad you enjoyed it fellas..my buddy came to visit from London & he brought chocolate & tea lol..I hooked him up with Whataburger & he liked it
As an American have some bbq sauce on the cornbread
I really enjoyed this episode. I sometimes take BBQ here in Florida for granted. The kids and the headmaster seemed to really enjoy the new experience of real BBQ. The headmaster seems like a friendly chap.
They don’t know a normal 9-5 person isn’t eating all that at once lol that’s a $100 plate 😭😭 maybe more
Awesome
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore..." LOL
Now maybe they can understand why us americans are so fat... lol
You should do this with a new set of students
If you have been to England then you know why this is so mind blowing for them. No offense to the English but they conquered the world for spices and never used them😂
You have to use butter and honey on the cornbread
8:31 yall should do pinto beans and cornbread next time you are down south.
Jeez, I'm american and i've never had BBQ that looked that good.
I love watching Brits find out what food that isn’t boiled or beans tastes like
when people try to convince me america has gone bad i know they dont think of the BBQ that will outlive us all
One of the best menus here that even the average American would like to eat this way more often.
My grandpa won trophies for his baked beans & barbecue in Memphis, Tn.
Quite a few of these students aren't British.
Are they cooking the food in the UK?
Should have been KC BBQ
Cornbread needs butter and honey, maybe a dash of vanilla. Unless.... you go savory
These guys are the only non-Americans who like America these days.
You did the Texas Fold version of Ratatouille’ing these Brits 👏
I have enjoyed all of these videos! But this is the best one and the first video I’ve been jealous of these lovely young men ❣️😆😉😎
That cornbread must have been terrible. Pork ribs looked bad too, so dry
Texan here I don’t really eat cornbread with bbq a good pot of beans or purple hulls peas or a pot of stew or soup is what cornbread is for
that is a nice looking brisket. finally they can understand the size of Americans lol
Next time they gotta put butter or honey on the cornbread or dip it in the beans
Someone tell those kids they need to sauce up the ribs!
Why did they bite the sandwich in the middle?
I’m a southerner, and I don’t like dry cornbread either. When I make it, I usually add sour cream and cream corn to make it a little more moist.
This is a bit unfair, you give the kids good BBQ for lunch and then they go home and mom has made Bangers and Mash for dinner.😅😅
Cornbread is really hit or miss. It needs to be eaten hot from a cast iron pan with a big slab of butter and drizzle of honey.
they just didnt get the right cornbread, nor the right baked beans or mac n cheese...somebody gave those guys the wrong recipe
poor bastards
I love when people try Texas BBQ we are literally known for some fire BBQ and you can't convince me any other state is making it how we do. Bigger, Better, Tastier! ❤😊 I love how all the kids had their own outer body experience they ain't never tasted seasoning like that before lol.
For the cost of a cup of coffee a day, you can sponsor a British child who has never tasted flavor before
Now you guys seriously know why Americans have an eating problem. Let’s not judge anyone, because we now know how easy it is to over eat on really delicious food. Your stomach will literally grow just to fit more of it if you’re enjoying it.
I've only had  BBQ at mediocre joints and I f*cking love it, I can't imagine how good are the top teir ones
I got the meat sweats just from watching them
"British peopple try flavor"
All participants are cooked . They won't be the same eatin food anymore
Where did y’all get that legitimate BBQ in England?!
The boy who said “that’s lovely” and looked 🤯
Those blk kids arent british.
Someone bites into food, " oh man that's good"  Those two guys "LOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLHAHAHHAHAHAHHHAALOLOLAHAHAHALOALAOOYHHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ..........................shitheads
Poor kids they gonna be thinking about that food for the next decade 😂
This brings a smile to this Texans face!!!
No southern is better than British beans ok period!
The cornbread should have been served with real salted butter, so they didn't get the whole cornbread experience.
Oh yeah! Texas bbq!
I’m from south Texas and now I need some brisket. 😂
Texas has good technique, but Kansas City has the best BBQ. Our sauce is amazing too.
Welcome to Heaven, lads.
This is why southern Americans say British food is incredibly bland.
Interesting to see them not liking the texture on the Mac and cheese. It's like they were raised eating bland slop.
The corn bread needs to be warm with either honey butter or butter and jelly
This is painful to watch how privileged they are and how they have zero idea about other things smh
Now I’m hungry for BBQ.
I think it's funny that other countries never experienced BBQ. But I'm guessing they have a lot of stuff we haven't experienced either. I'm love watching them trying brisket for the first time.  I love brisket.  ❤
Those kids will be going home, sleepy as hell.
Un Fn real smh
That wasn’t a good cornbread. I make a good southwestern cornbread that’s savory that would knock your socks off.
Seriously how do they not know.......?????
Omg unreal how they dont know
Brits doing American food for Brits  is wild to me.
In The states a lot of people don’t know that Alabama actually has the best barbecue
"british" highschoolers arent black...
Sorry son, cornbread is a southern staple. People make it differently across the South.
Brits are not accustom to the taste of freedom.
Bunch of British kids that don't like beans is weird
These poor boys are going to fall into a meat coma
its just good ole barbeque, not Texas BBQ
You choose the right young men for this. Skeptical but never disrespectful. When they like something they devour it when they don't "it's not for me". Very polite still. Great video, I'll never get tired of you guys!
Word is these young men are building smokers , watching Texan YouTubers , and  are actively trying to source fresh whole Briskets!
See why we’re all fat?? Do you blame us??
Oddly as a Texan I’m not a big BBQ fan, but this video was still so fun to watch with how a part of our culture it is here.
You call it Texas BBQ and it is but burnt ends are a KC creation. FIGHT ME
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for appreciating our country's variety of wonderful food!!!
But remember, these boys were raised on Steak and Kidney Pud and Bangers n Mash. Anything should taste amazing to them.
No matter what you go through," God can always guide you. None of your problems are to hard for Him to handle! God sent Jesus to save you from every mess! He loves you and has the power to take away guilt and sin <3
Too bad you gave them the low end of barbecue. Kansas City is much much better and that a none negotiable
The disrespect on the corn bread. No butter or honey. Also looked dry
The pickles do ruin it though
I just wish their accent changed to southern after the first bite.
Anyone who would start a texas bbq in the UK would make a killing
I think Texans generally overdo the whole state pride thing which is annoying, but I still try to be as unbiased as possible. In the case of BBQ, nowhere does it as good as Texas. Not Kansas City, Memphis, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, or any of the other places that try to claim to have the best BBQ. Texas has us all beat, and frankly it’s not even a close competition.
You've gotta slather some honey butter on the cornbread.
Brits don't barbecue ⁉️ So who taught Australians🤣
I saw yall bring out the plates and i saw the size of them and got worried. Your gonna kill those kids with flavor.
my mouth's WATERING
I've ate BBQ in about every state...nothing and I mean nothing beats Texas...
Everything is better with bread. Innit?
Say what you want about America, but we get a couple things right. One bite at a time. 🤤
Looks like we're boosting some interest in immigration.
I love these videos with the high schoolers! Keep them coming please!
Just had some BBQ for Juneteenth at the park. The price was donations. So worth it.
Where's the Dr. Pepper?  Texas is Dr. Pepper country! 🐩
As to cornbread, it depends upon how you make it.  The real traditional way is cup flour, cup corn meal, 3-4 tsp baking powder, egg, 1/4 tsp salt,  1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup milk.  NO SUGAR.  If you want it the way everyone else outside of the actual South makes it, you have more flour and add sugar.  (Southerners would call it a corn cake, as it has softer texture and is sweet.)  You eat it with butter, and possibly honey, but mainly to add to beans, and other foods.  As to "tea".  You should have said iced sweet tea, not tea.  It's flavor really depends upon the type of tea being used.  (Tetley or Luzzian preferred.)
Do the Brits across the pond smoke meat often?
So one kid cries and practically comes repeatedly through what he admitted is the most delicious meal he's ever had, and his only comment is, "Never make corn bread again?!" 😂😂😂😂
The first time any of them have ever tried seasoning.
the headmaster is so me lmfao! I would have indulged so much in this food, it's my favorite American dish
No pickled raddish is a crime 😊
I am so hungry! Pork ribs are my favorite
I’ve never heard us call it a Texas fold. We call it a brisket sandwich!!
Yall should've given them honeybaked cornbread. Also, though, cornbread is better when its thinner. Those big cake-sized cornbreads are typically pretty bland and also just crumble apart, which is annoying
As a native Texas, this warms my heart!
Love that the teacher/principal had meat sweats! 😂😂😂
Unpopular opinion  but cornbread 😢no thanks
I love these videos!! These Brits are so fun !! BBQ IS KING!!!
I wish the headmaster could go with yall on your next American food visit conquest lol
I kind of wish they never tried out obese menu
❤😂now the English understand why we are overweight 😂😂
no Texas Toast 🙁
When Gordon Ramsey had the show where he went to restaurants to help them, the one that he said had the best food he had ever tasted was one that a black American lady owned. Her restaurant was small and tucked into a corner, which I think was part of the problem.  She made all the food and it was advertised as down home southern cooking.  After Gordon left, her restaurant was very busy.  If there was an American who wanted to open a restaurant in England with Texas BBQ, they would make a fortune!
The kids don't know what the itis is, but they gon learn today
I have always thought Josh and Ollie both emote like stereotypical Americans do. The headmaster's reaction seems like proper British appreciation to me. Enjoyment, but don't make a scene. 😂
You need to put some butter on the cornbread, makes it a lot better.
These poor people have never had good food before 🥲
I'm from the south and I don't like sweet conbread either! Real cornbread ishas no sugar in it and has a nice crust from a melted butter cast iron pan it was cooked in. It's made with buttermilk , cut in wedges, sliced in half and slathered in butter!
Please dont move to texass, its a red state
Hint to all you Brits drooling over US food. Learn to cook.
I just love watching your videos; the enjoyment you get watching their reactions as well as their amazement at the foods I take for granted.
I’m from south Texas and brisket is our staple! I was cooked correctly here!!  My dad RIP would cook the best brisket I’ve ever had! Wish I got the whole ingredients and process written down before he passed..I miss his cooking!!
This is such wholesome content. Yet, I'm forever grateful that my ancestors had a disagreement and decided to leave on boat to travel to America... yet I'm still jealous of good fish and chips or bangers and mash. Toad in a hole would be nice, and give me a Shepherd's pie over our poultry pot pie options. Still, America does meat justice ;) . Love the video and really appreciate these genuine (yet artificial) moments of exposure. Keep it up!
South Texas cornbread has jalapeños and should have some butter on it
Brisket definitely wasn't tender enough. But still looked good though
Put some sugar in your corn bread. Not too much. Sweet corn bread is just . . . amazing
Three British kids and one African.
Put the knife and fork away what shame 😂
A good BBQ brisket could bring world peace.
As a southerner watching these kids eat good food is great. A Texas Fold must be like a Tennessee Pocketbook sandwich
"A huge raisin,"'lol!
I'm sorry you boys live in such a trash country
Not to be a downer but I don't think it's a prideful thing that the "food tastes so good" when the taste is mainly coming from the high fat content mixed with the simple carbs. Like Texas has an obesity rate of 35.4% mark by the CDC.   Cool British "people" like it but maybe there's a reason why they don't eat it daily
Hardly any barbecue joints have very good coleslaw or mac & cheese (or corn bread, unless it has a whole bunch of honey butter on it), but I've always been unimpressed with the coleslaw and mac of barbecue joints that have amazing meats.
That’s what we , in the south, call  hot water cornbread, get them babies some jiffy 😂
Can't imagine canned beans on toast after this feast . . . .is food just normally bland in England? I'm Yankee born but my family roots are in the Heart of Dixie and I was raised on southern cooking; real corn bread, real hush puppies, meats cooked with flavor, everything made from scratch, even waffles & pancakes. Texas brisket has NO compare...the stuff served at Famous Dave's is awful....just has no flavor as compared to what we had in San Antonio. (dropping a sugar cube in plain,, brewed tea is NOT sweet tea).  Would sure be nice to have a place that served true Texas brisket instead of corporate beef.
I've long considered moving to the UK and opening up a BBQ joint. Louisiana Style, which is basically just texas bbq with, optionally, a bit more spice
the boy that has never had mac n cheese looks awfully a lot like brad pitt
texas is full of good food thats why theres so many fat ppl
I don't blame you, kid. That looked dry as a bone.  🤮   It needs to be drenched in, at least butter, if not honey butter.  🤤
i love how instinct brought them to put beans on the toast
The power to charge any device battery powered or not to a full 100%
they don't like the cornbread!?!? that's actually crazy
They're all going to be asleep for the rest of the day😂
As a Texan/Latina, who recently had BBQ & iced Tea (LOL!) I was smiling throughout this video. It makes me very happy to see that y'all like our food! In my region, we usually have potato salad instead of slaw. With pickles, we have whole jalapeños & carrot slices (no joke). Some cornbread has corn kernels in it, & it's eaten with butter & honey (optional), so it can be dessert or a side. Nice to see our BBQ eaten & liked in the U.K. Take care, y'all! 🤠👍❤
US will introduce the real obesity to UK
These poor kids, having been raised on an English diet, lol.   Welcome to life, boys.
The cornbread part is NUTS
It's amazing how well these kids can articulate and explain themselves. Compared to kids here in the US of their age.
Yessss. There’s a southern bbq and brisket place near me in PA run by a no nonsense black Woman. You have to put your order in weeks ahead because she has so much business. My mouth is watering thinking of her food. She’s older and I fear the day she retires.
Gotta get em famous daves cornbread with texas roadhouse butter
Imagine saying you have a gift for someone, asking if the recipient is planning on going on holiday then that gift being free data- something we used to get when we were part of the EU anyway. Everyone is expecting an actual holiday lads, savage.
Harry reminds me of the little villain from The Robertsons he's so cute 😂😂
See why we are fat? But its good fat when done right
The fast food from the US is not worth bothering with but this is a real taste of the American south.
Since when does a 9-year-old child say, "tastes sublime?"  I had to look up the meaning again. I'm feeling really stupid right now.
Poor kid who hates Mac and cheese because his mom can’t cook is crazy 😂
I just noticed it's Texas, and not from other Southern states...
Imagine this video with girls 🤣🤣🤣 it'll be totally different 🤣🤣🤣
The ages listed for these school boys is not accurate.
Headmaster been working out. That’s good
We love our TEXAS BBQ!!!❤
"our" cornbred, lmfao. everything the british has as "theirs" has been stolen, children.
Are the kids segregated at that school?
Lol these kids are so adorable ❤
When you make cornbread use corn chowder instead of water. It makes all the difference
As a Southerner, there have been damn near wars fought over less divisive statements than "don't ever make cornbread again." I'm sorry, y'all obviously tried some not good cornbread, and if you ever find yourself in the South, be sure to try some.
I love to see this. I’m from Kansas, but I’m a fan of this food. Awesome to see other country’s appreciation of the USA foods, as I hope we would be in their country. Blessings to all.
Beats the hell out of beans and toast, doesn’t it? 😁  But wait- no pulled pork? What?
Where I live in the Southern USA, our cornbread is sweet. I know what they were talking about when they say it had no flavor. I have had that type as well, and I don't like it. Thanks for the video.
My only critique is giving the cornbread after the rich meat…..of course the cornbread won’t be as flavorful.
Awful young for highschool.
They started them off on the burnt ends, that's like Metallica opening for a local band.
One of our local BBQ joints has a hot link that is one of the most flavorful foods I have ever had. I wish I could have put that on their plates.
This was a good one head master was super cool
As a lifelong Texan, I 100% agree “never make cornbread again.” 💯😂
I'm just trying to figure out how you got legitimate, real Texas barbecue in England. Do they even have the right equipment for that over there?
Ok 2 things I hate when folks don’t know how to cook cornbread you need a cast iron pan put lard or oil in said pan put it in the oven get it hot real hot then take it out put pour said cornbread mix in the super hot oil it will make it crunchy on the bottom like a hush puppies then most folks don’t know you can put cornbread in milk sounds bad but try it all this comes from my country granny that I loved with all my heart none of that yellow bottom corn bread it should be dark crunchy golden brown when you take it out turn it upside down like a cake so the crunchy part is on top try it 🎉🎉🎉
The English literally colonizing the world for spices putts literally none of it in their food
Dry cornbread is criminal
They should try fresh out of the oven cornbread with a side of apple butter mixed with honey add salted butter
Cornbread with butter and syrup.
I've never tried this but I've heard its absolutely incredible.  Some of the best food on planet earth.
Seeing British peopel react to American food makes me think that the civilisation of British people is possible and even close at hand.
"It's Absolutely Sublime" 💯 😂
All of their expressions were great!  America is the GREATEST!
You are watching the same exact thing the us did to the Japanese to have them start drinking coffee...smh
Those kids need a Weber grill and a BBQ cookbook.
At least they can use big words!! Can we import the intelligence?
Southern cornbread darlin, is wonderful!
Is my family the only one's that add honey or sugar to the cornbread before we skillet bake it? It always comes out sweet and delicious.
That's great that these British kids are enjoying American BBQ, but in all honesty, and as good as barbecue is in Texas; the BEST will always be Carolina BBQ, and Kansas City BBQ, at a close second. I know that this comment will trigger people from the Lonestar State, but facts are facts.
Texan here, the real kind from the country lol. We don’t eat cornbread with our bbq, at least not normally. That bbq looks legitimate though. The smoke ring on the brisket was spot on and it passed the pull-apart test for tenderness.
I got spareribs on the smoker now.
13:40 - the boy made enemies he didn’t know he should fear with that one
Haha love this! Bring the lot of them they can stay with my fam and i here in New Braunfels, TX just south of Austin & north of San Antonio. Bbq one day AND Tex Mex the next. Southern hospitality is real, i reckon we’ll make Texans out of them all 😂
Em mf’ers look like middle schoolers 😂 wtf
butter and molasses and a lil bit of milk
Obesity is one hellava journey ain’t it?
Please, get  TRUE Texan to make them REAL baked beans,baked mac, hot water cornbread&some sun tea... also, all that BBQ wasn't from Texas(True Texans know better)
Them kids are effed up for Life😂
Zadok the Priest when the brisket comes out 😂😂😂😂😂
Texas does do Beef BBQ great but Pork ribs goes to Memphis
Spreading high cholesterol one country at a time😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4 other states in the US with better BBQ than Texas, wait until they try that!
The pride  I've always had as an American had been amplified tenfold by seeing these kids enjoy quintessential  southern cuisine. Welcome to the south
If they add sugar to the corn bread, than it's called corn cake. Corn bread is served best warm with butter.  Some people crumble corn bread up into their butter milk
They believe it's the best cause they have never had it before but there is way better bbq that just what's in texas
ads for deaf people lmaoo
You don't eat cornbread straight up, you use it to soak up the delicious flavors and juices
Dey wuz kangz..😂
Hearing foreigners enjoy our food warms my heart
The best wisecrack of the episode: Josh: "Have you, guys, ever had Southern BBQ before?" One student: "I've had, like, this bread."
Yes, Americans can cook!!
As a Texan, videos like this remind me how lucky I am. I so hope all them are able to visit texas one day.
Oh I want some ❤
I'm from California and I'm jealous bc we don't have good bbq readily available here. I always get some Texas BBQ when I visit my family in Austin.
We have this in North Carolina as well.
It is good to see British people eating BBQ properly! With there hands!
“That’s lovely that.”💙 I never get tired of hearing it.😁 ❤ from Texas!! 🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧
I can eat that entire brisket myself 😀🤤
No sauce required 💪🏾💪🏾 real texas boys 🤘🏾
Cornbread made with brown butter in the batter is what I’ve been making and it’s *chefs kiss*.
Dry cornbread is gross. No butter, no honey? Yuck!
How did they get it to the UK?
Was it hot water cornbread or that Jiffy? Was the tea super sweet(🤢) or just sun tea? Makes a difference.
as an American raised in the South I'm begging y'all to redo the cornbread with honey butter, and if you can, bake it in a cast iron pan greased down with bacon fat 😩 these boys deserve a fair shot 😭  You did good with the sweet tea though. I don't see any lemon wedges but the color and foggy-ness look right 🤤
All the things they are trying for the first time....what do they eat over there?all I ever hear is fish and French fries.
They should try real actual BBQ next, Texas BBQ is good but it’s no where close to KC BBQ the literal location where BBQ was invented in America lmaoooo STUPID AND DUMB TEXAS BBQ ISNT EVEN BETTER THAN MEMPHIS BBQ
You probably shouldn't start out with "we have a gift for you" when the gift is a promo ad and a $1.50 discount.. dude probably thought you were paying for his trip lmao
These poor children have never tasted flavor before :C
i moved to texas 5 years ago and i'm gonna be so honest and say i teared up having bbq once😭
JOLLY, back in the '50s and '60s, much of Europe thought all Americans ate at McDonald/s 3 times per day.  With the advent of more international travel, and YouTube channels like yours, that misconception has been seriously dispelled.  Thanks for your part in that.
Kid eyes start watering 😂😂😂😂😂
As a fellow American I will say the food you prepared looks amazing but that corn bread you did it all wrong add some bacon, cheese and jalapeño to you’re mix
Look at these kids putting the beans on the bread. So British 😅
this is probly a big upgrade over beans on toast and the brown slop they usually eat
no banana pudding???
Watching these kids grow up makes me feel so old 😅
Sent these boys right to Heaven absolutely love the headmaster 😂😂 bro said THIS IS THE BEST SANDWICH IVE EVER HAD other kid said idk if i can eat food here anymore 😂
Did they give them Texas sweet (iced) tea, as well??
….tell them not to come here lol…for now at least
Cornbread is always a hit or a mess. Thankfully, my mom left me her best cornbread recipe. It’s very delicious if you get someone who can make it right.
I agree with these young men! I love me some good barbecue!!! ❤
This makes me miss Texas! I still live in the American South, but each region has their own spin on barbecue. Texas BBQ draws upon the rich history of German (and Czech) immigrants in Texas adapting their meat cooking techniques to the ingredients that were available. Beef instead of pork, corn instead of wheat. But the spice blends (and most importantly the mustard) rubbed onto beef brisket before smoking overnight draw upon German immigrants to Central Texas.
I love watching these kids, they’re so genuine.
North Carolina BBQ is better!! 😂😂😂 Don't fight me Texans lol
I'm a fifth generation Texan, and I've never heard of the "Texas fold".  Maybe it's something used outside the state to describe us, idk.  We do, however, put Texas Toast (toasted, ofc) with our BBQ.  It's a thicker cut of bread than regular "sliced" bread.  I also was wondering where the sliced onions were, and the pecan pie or banana pudding, in this feast.
But, but but why can't Dave take his Holiday in the USA??? 😢
It’s like if we brought different variations of harry potter to the south 😂😂
As a southerner, I love when they describe the food as “lovely” and “nice”. That barbecue has never felt so classy! 😂😂
How about having the lads give chili a go?  Or some American casseroles like the ones you had in Michigan?  Or maybe see about taking them to one of the American bases on the 4th of July?
As someone from Virginia, neither the cornbread nor the mac and cheese looked appealing or like a good representation of what has been known to be the main event (or at least the main side) at any meal on either side of my family. I knew at first blink that it was not going to be appreciated like it should have been. The cornbread looked dry and bland. At least provide it warmed with butter melting on it. I can't tell what kind of cheese or cheeses were in the Mac, but it didn't look like the versions that I know "hit". Side note, the fact that the guys didn't seem to eat the beans w/o putting it on the bread was funny/cute to me. That said, I'm glad they liked the options, overall. I waited to watch until after I ate and still want to try everything I saw (even the two I mentioned).
These are high school kids? They looks so young 😮
I think I gained 10 pounds watching them eat all that food. Lol!!!
With corn bread they need butter on it
Bring Dave to the US!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
As a Southerner, I only have two small critiques, and those are based off of the way my family does it. First, normally, we make sweet cornbread so that even on its own it has some good flavor. Second, we still have the tea really sweet, but we also try to make it as strong as we can.
Corn bread is for pushing the rest through in the morning. Nothing good is free.
You gotta put butter on the cornbread
Not highschoolers if they are 7 unless these are geniuses
Yeah texas sides suck...barbecue is great
That cornbread ain’t got no seasoning ifykyk
With corn bread it depends on who makes us really
The quote the British these are proper school children
The only cornbread my mother made was as dry as a popcorn fart.  Crumbly too.😁 Granted, it was designed to be covered with milk and sugar.  She was a fantastic southern cook (and farm cook) but never learned how to make sweet cornbread.😂. We never missed it though because everything else was so very good including all the other breads she made.
From a Texan, put honey butter on the corn bread
The next time you go to the US, go to a supermarket, and get some of the flavored ice tea mixes in cans to take back for the school.
You failed them by not putting butter and honey on the cornbread!!!
🤠😂😂 LOVE!!! FROM TEXAS!!! ❤️🤍💙😎
As a Texan, very proud these kiddos love the BBQ.  But Jolly . . come on . . you can create your own freaking Texas BBQ franchise chain and every chain has a Texas BBQ represetantive . . . Franklin BBQ . . Snow's . . Kreutz . . .Terry Black's  . . .Heim . . . It would work and I want my 10% for the idea.
There a LOTS of different cornbreads. He needs to try a different kind :)
Howdy from Lockhart, TX the "BBQ Capital of Texas" 🤠... My Texas fold is brisket, cheddar cheese, avacado, pickles and onions.
Oh, you wanted it to be more bland... lol
😂 Then you get FAT like us.😅
They need to eat sweet cornbread next time 😊
Did you fly over a pit master? Or fly OUT the bbq?
as an American i love watching British people enjoy American food
🤘🏽
Burnt-ends*
Damn over a million views in 2 days! Wow! All of us Americans loving these Brits love our bbq!❤❤❤️ I love these videos so much!!! Their minds were blown!🤯 Lol😂 All their comments had me laughing the whole time!🤣🤣🤣Crazy how much they're loving it and this is what we eat every summer!😂😂😂
Is it better than British baked beans?  Child: "No"  40 year old headmaster having mouth orgasm: "Oh my goodness" 🤣🤣🤣
best video ever this makes me happy
I crush up my cornbread in my garlic mashed potatoes. It is amazing. True blue texans mix everything up though. Add some sauce n beans to the mac n cheese. Everything goes with everything lol.
I'm from Georgia (U.S) and even though I don't like corn bread myself, I felt an ancient, deep rooted, biologic erge to go to war with Britain JUST because that one kid said, "Please, never make corn bread again." as his final message. 😂
I love people enjoying our Texas BBQ 😁
It's wild to me they don't like the cornbread.
you guys are peaking these kids early on food lol
Can't call it Texas bbq unless it's made by a Texan.
I’m not a brisket fan but I’m sooo hungry 😂
Yeah that cornbread didn't look great. Now I make a ridiculous jalapeño cornbread from scratch!! But i can't do the rest of that so, good on y'all!
Cornbread is SUPPOSED to be smothered in soft butter. No wonder the kid thought it was dry and terrible.
“British high schoolers AND foreign black invaders try Texas bbq”
People blame the sweets for our obesity problem. After watching this channel, Im beginning to believe that it's just the proportioning. 😂
This was nice, watching people enjoy what others have to offer
I'd tell you what, them kids tasting that there food is right funny. Damn I got the hungries now.
Pop and Circumstance for the ribs was perfect😂
So they don’t have bbq grills?
My husband I like to “cook around the world” where we find authentic recipes and cook food from other places and I gotta say.. British food has been the only disappointment so far 😂
So refreshing to see the good manners these young men have,it was a pleasure watching them enjoy their meal😊
had me drooling the entire 14 minutes.. wanna share?
I should not have watched this on a one-meal-a-day diet!😂
Add some honey butter to the cornbread.
Those top lads are welcome in any Texas bbq joint
This is one of the best episode so far.
Now you know why we Americans are all so fat!! Enjoy!
Right on, the head master should get a trip to the U.S.!
Cornbread should never be eaten without butter
Cornbread should not be dry
You should put honey& butter on the cornbread. Thats the way midwesterners eat it.
"That looks lovely" got me
I've always wondered... Is there a reason they only make these videos with boys?
Thank you for loving our food! 😊
Hey yo how is this stuff getting to these kids fresh or is it reheated.
Now they're finding out why we get fat in America😂😂😂😂
Aww bless their hearts! ❤ This was a wonderful video! 😊
This ain’t no fish and chips mate. Merica !!!!
Add honey to the cornbread batter, trust me on this
I love these kids. You are welcome in America anytime❤❤❤
And this is why we don’t believe anyone outside of the southern States region when they say they’re “having a barbecue.”   Cornbread is definitely not for everyone, and it needs to be made correctly (at minimum: bacon fat in the pan, NO SUGAR), but it is soooo good fresh out of the oven and with a big pat of butter.   Anyway. Welcome to the world of slow-cooked meats, guys.
This is too much flavor for Brits! That poor kid started to involuntary tear up.
The Headmaster is so adorable. I love watching people try new foods lol
Slaur 😭
The principal is the real lucky one.. hes done this so many times, but every time he gets a new experience.
Headmaster Smith a Legend 😂😂
Born and raised in San Angelo Texas grew up on Mesquite smoked barbecue my whole life. I love watching y’all’s videos and watching people try some good old Texas barbecue I would argue Texan to know how to cook animals the best!!!!
I lived in the UK for three years. This is how I felt when I came home to Chicago, put it all in front of me!
I knew the Black kids would love it. That was a given!
Lol! Why are they eating with their hands🤔
you need to put honey butter on that cornbread
Wait until the meat sweats kick in
Being Texan, my family rarely eats cornbread with BBQ mostly with chili, beans, soups or beef stew. Unless it is enhanced cornbread with  sun dried tomatoes, onions, Jalapeño and cream style corn then its a side dish.  Edit to add: If you are going to eat plain cornbread it must have lots of salted butter or its illegal use of cornbread.
I'm pretty sure Britain could never have any Texas barbecue place because their plumbing would never be able to handle it 🤣
This is why we’re fat. We eat delicious food.
So adorable. I am glad for them to have the opportunity. We love to eat in the USA!
THIS ... has got to be the best video yall have done so far ... the pure joy on their faces says it all .... BBQ !!!!!
how do you get TX bbq in the UK for this video???
Not your ordinary brickle brackle and  fizzy wickets is it lads?
British beans are cheap beans out of a can.  What they are eating are real baked beans.
My family and I like to melt butter and honey into our cornbread!
High schoolers??? Bruh like half of these look like 6th graders
Next time you offer cornbread put butter on it first!!!!!!!
Texas BBQ is different from other states.  I've never adjusted to sauce on the side.
Very curious what type of cornbread they had. Some are savory and not sweet. Some throw in jalapeños, some have actual corn bits. Cornbread can really make or break a good bbq platter.
As a Texan, I understand.  Brisket is addicting, when cooked perfectly.
I want this so bad . . .
As a Texan our food is amazing and our women are hot outside of San Antonio  Houston women of course
As a wise man once said..“Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. I know you’re from where you’re from, but we gonna stop with the knives. You pull it apart with your hands, and listen, you take your fingers and you lift it up and you eat it.”
Finally! I’ve been waiting to watch this for so long. Thank you!
Now they understand why us Americans tend to be overweight! Lol
I'm an American, and I agree with you. Cornbread s*cks.
Sweet tea is not anything like British tea.
As a Texan for 23 years. Yeah. I get it. The food and women made me stay here.
The joy I got just watching this is priceless. And whoever chose/cast the kids should get a raise.
I absolutely love this! I wish i could bring them some Lubbock Texas BBQ, specifically Evie Maes or Shack BBQ from here.
While we americans may not eat the healthest all the time I do love seeing British people try our foods for the first time. Its like they never ate good tasting food before.
No better tasters than a group of ravenous young men. I raised 3 of them, lol But give those boys a pile of napkins (like we would do here!) And have a selection of delicious dipping sauces
It’s crazy I never knew how lucky I was BBQ is just a normal thing here in Texas but if you go anywhere in the world they talk about our food. Kinda crazy
Id love to smash that texas bbq platter.......in return id send Americans all the dairy milk chocolate and galaxy chocolate they can eat, cos we all know that American chocolate is dog sh*t
now they understand why we’re all fat😂
Yes yes  *rub hands Now that is some American food
You don't eat cornbread without smothering it with butter first
Greetings from the RGV at the bottom of Texas! It's awesome to see our friends experience our local food.
The boys are fantastic to watch, but Mr. Smith is just amazing.
As popular as it is here (100% southerner here), can’t believe it’s never been introduced to the British! It would be CRAZY successful and popular - as you can see! BBQ is the BEST!!! 😋💗
'Oh, my days'. That kid is so cute. Poor kid's never had a pickle before? Don't British people barbecue? What are you feeding these poor children?
They need to try sweet cornbread.
The way they just edgerly shove it into their mouths. They have learned that these guys will not lead them wrong.
That was beautiful to watch 😂
I understand the kid who doesn't like like the cornbread. I love corn in any other way you can make it, except bread. My entire family loves it. I can't stand it. So weird.
And this is why the British supported the South in the Civil War...they just preferred Southern food vs the bland Northern food that still exists today in the UK. This also proves that humans are carnivores and not vegans. Have you ever seen a kid light up like that after eating broccoli or kale?
Dude these kids eat beans bread like anything would be better
Love people enjoying Southern food😊 Its our love language to feed people. Even if we dont have a lot of money, we will at least feed you right. How adorable they are watching them try the foods. 1 thing though, cornbread has to be warm with butter spread on it so that it just gets gooey as the butter melts. Serve it to them warm with butter next time!
This is how you make people fat.
Harry looks like goob from meet the Robinsons
The boys are so cute;;
Maaaaan listen i have the same reaction everytime and im from America lmao it’s never not first time good when it’s cooked right 😂
This is why Americans are fat!  Good food.
Have they try some soul food
I was here for this right up until you asked if they'd ever had "southern barbecue" before. Texas is not the South. Texans are not Southerners. Texas BBQ is not Southern cuisine. Texas is the Southwest. The South ends at Louisiana, up to Arkansas, then banks East into Tennessee, up to West Virginia. Texas is not included. They've got great food and great people, but they're not Southerners.
This is why us in the south are overweight. Too much good food.
I'm from Virginia, so I would LOVE to try Texas BBQ myself. I'm soo jealous right now😅😅
eat up guys!  I love to watch you discover flavors,  and barbecue is on of my favorites!
And to see them eating the proper way(with hands) is pretty awesome.
It's not so hard to impress Brits with food, you know...
They aren't British.... If a White man is born in china an i Chinese?
Texas stay fronting. They got bbq like errbody else in America. Issue is y ppl aren’t doing this in England lol
There's no R in the word slaw. And A sounds different from O.   It's not slohr.
Kansas bbq next please 😂 burnt endssss
first time trying real food
Texan here  This is beautiful
Those kids speak so eloquently❤
Cornbread needs honey butter.
i have always said the BEST way to gauge good messy food like this is whether or not you just unleash the beast and stop worrying about sticky hands and sauce on your face. i HATE having sticky saucy hands, BUT when something is this good, i couldn’t care less 😩
This makes me so happy to see my childhood favorites being enjoyed by children across the pond lol❤
It makes sense that the Brits don't like cornbread because corn isn't a staple food for them, unlike in the United States, where it has been since the colonial period. It's weird to me that they can't enjoy sweet tea, even though I think most Americans can enjoy sweet tea and a regular hot cup of tea. I guess the disconnect is that Brits like really bland and unflavorful food. I'm not shocked since that is what they are accustomed to.
As an American, watching that was really cool
Love living in Texas, we got amazing BBQ. Then in between BBQ meals you get Tex-Mex. Great stuff.
You didn’t make the cornbread correctly😡. You forgot the honey butter it elevates the cornbread flavor 😢
I love watching Brits 1. Talk with their mouths full 2. Eat with their fingers 3. Forget all proper eating etiquette  I am so happy that they are enjoying themselves soooo much!
How do they get it over there looking so good or are they in texas?
HOW do they access Texas BBQ for them to try??  Is this IN the  UK?  I follow y a'll, just wondered how you managed to do this !!!❓❓😊😊  BTW: in the South, when you say "BBQ or Ribs, you mean Pork.  And a sweet BBQ is common. YAY
I know why Islam is taking over the UK These people are so sweet
He said the steak looks like a huge raisin. 😅😅
This head master has tried everything. Surprised he isn't larger. He and the kids really love T BBQ.
Who the hell calls a brisket sandwhich "the Texas fold"
Whoever made that cornbread just didn't do a good job. Cornbread is life if made properly!!
I love how the headmaster loves everything you put in front of him. 😭 Bro could eat anything
omg they are so sweet the kinds - insane - love it
Y'all are looking at future American citizens.  Lol.  When they graduate from college, they'll come to Texas to get jobs and apply for citizenship, just for the food.  Lol.
It's good you said "Southern Tea", in TX we only drink unsweet, no sugar iced tea, differentiates us from the "South"
Have you gone completely mad? You're going to ruin those boys with all that Texas BBQ. 😂
My eyes are watering lmao damn kid. Texas is a place I would love to go visit and eat! 🤘🏽🔥
I want to know how the cornbread was made😮!!!! Because i. Guarantee you he would like mine.
Great add read. Almost always skip, watched the whole thing. They should pay you more for this one alone. Well done.
I don't think i can eat food here anymore 😅!!!!
Kansas City bbq is infinitely better
Gotta have the cornbread warm with butter and honey on it.
Equivalent of cavemen discovering fire
Now, they learned why Americans are obese
great country. in britian the black peopole sit together. not by choice, they were told to.
Not only does it cleanse your mouth the cornbread that is but also collects all the grease and oils that's in your stomach and helps your body process it
and this. is why its so hard to be lean in the US lol
Baked beans are terrible. Pinto beans with lots of juice and its own bowl. That’s where the cornbread comes in.
"I can't even explain. It's absolutely sublime."
What's the deal with putting the beans on bread?  They just ruined the beans.
Eating brisket with their fingers is driving me crazy!!  Not enough napkins!
11:40 you want it to be more Bland 😂
I'm so hungry now!
The kid states "There is water in my eyes. "  😢😂😂😂😂😂
It’s gonna be like those skits when someone eats human flesh and they can no longer quell the rabid hunger. These boys are going to be roaming the UK looking for their next bite of Texas BBQ 🤣
Always spread butter on the cornbread. Maybe dip It in the juices. Lmao
😂 do British people call just plain old American BBQ all Texas BBQ 😂 also what happens if you fail a grade in the UK are you still year 7 even though it's more like year 8 but you failed so are still a year 7 student 😂 why is everything so willy wonka over there
Put butter on cornbread.
Ok look. It’s not a Texas BBQ without pinto beans cooked right! That’s what the cornbread is for. Put butter on your cornbread and break it up into your beans. Thats chef’s kiss! Born and Raised 3rd generation Texan! FJB
DANG NOW IM HUNGRY FOR BBQ!!!
Too cheesy? You’ll never make it as an American, young man. Round here there’s no such thing as too cheesy.
It was as if they didnt have silverware 😂
I have traveled to the UK and Europe several times. I wish I could be like the Europeans eating real American barbecue for the first time again. It’s just ridiculous. So good.
Warm cornbread with loads of butter and honey
I really wonder if some of these kids will go on to careers in food. To have exposure to so many different cuisines like this is such a great way to give them an appreciation for food around the world.
I wonder if any of them got the meat sweats. 😂
Young black man said "I think our people just eat it in one go." That's right. Stay black young one. 💪🏾👊🏾
That at ain’t Texas BBQ, that brisket was sliced as thick as a steak.
OK, that corn bread needed some butter and a tiny bit of honey, honey.
I love the fact that their biggest critic is that the food is not bland enough lmao
Add butter and honey on the corn bread.
Always go with spicy cornbread. Drain and add a can of rotel before baking. But the headmasters face says it all, like, why have I not moved to Texas yet
Unlike countries like France which have tried to keep foreign foods & cuisines out, America has welcomed the foods & cuisines of other countries - our national anthem should be "That's GOOD! May I have some more...?".
The tea looks a little like an Arnold Palmer.  Give them black, sweet iced tea to wash all that down.
Это ведь правда не честный прием, то что я вижу на экране? отцовские гордости и гастрономические чудеса, которые эти ЧАДЫ уплетают! :))
Compare these Brit Blacks with American Blacks.   It's all about culture.
I love these kids every time! I do feel like they need to try a Southern Sweet Cornbread that’s moist and delicious. They’ll love it.
😅 Americans aren’t fat for no reason. Everyone has jokes until they taste our food firsthand 😈 joooooooooin uuuuuuuuussssssss! 😵‍💫🤪
Next time you should put honey and butter on your cornbread
I didn't like cornbread for years until someone at the firehouse made it mixed with vanilla pudding mix... Its amazing.
I’m surprised the kids tucked in without sauce! I know it was seasoned well, but my American self wanted them to slow down and sauce up lol
Ok so where did you get this from and where do I need to go??
Is that from Terry Black's, and how did you get it over? ❤️
I love watching people eat Texas bbq. Sincerely, a proud Texan
These lads are gonna be putting 3 inch lift kits on their Jeeps and listening to country music in no time...
What? "Don't make cornbread ever again"?  Take that kid's BBQ privileges away!!! 🤣
Mix cornbread with beans.  Crumble em up in your hand and mix it in.  Yummm  Light drizzle of honey on top of cornbread is good too.  I'll be honest, I love honey -- but it doesn't like me.  Gives me really bad heartburn almost every time.    I tend to get people upset by what I do with briskets.   For some pieces (not all, I do enjoy brisket normally) I'll yoss em in the oven and get the fat cooked fown a bit more.  I'm honestly not a fan of eating any meat fat unless the texture is just right.  I consider it an ARFID thing.  Not gelatanous per say, denser...  Avaolutely sublime with the meat.    I've tried a bean sammich recently.  Nope, didnt like it.  Texture of the bread is what did it for me.  Mushified.... **Shudders** but hey, I tried it at least.   I don't like mac and cheese to have a crust either.  I don't eat mac and cheese that often these days (lactose intolerance), but once in a blue moon I'll have a fork full.  I like to have kale or broccoli mixed in with it.   Or as a special treat, nori seaweed strips/flakes on top.  Now that's good!
Eat the Mac and cheese with some of the meat in one bite! Yummmm
We also have Mayonnaise and Mustard based BBQ sauces.  Really good if you are doing brisket folds.
Why do some of the supposed Brit’s look like Africans?
i like this new group of students and of course the return of "Mr Smith" aka Dave!
I freakin love Harry. Kid so open he just go in. I mean he devoured everything
✍🏼move✍🏼to✍🏼England✍🏼and✍🏼put✍🏼a✍🏼BBQ✍🏼joint✍🏼.  got it !!. 💵💵💵💵 🤑
Mack looks like a young Brad Pitt.
The USA is the greatest country on Earth for a reason
I always like watching these videos But one thing I've noticed is that British people Including High Schoolers are Generally very Polite and Respectful
I love the background music... it fits the handsome faces of the boys perfectly !! Well done!  🎉❤  corn bread with honey...
I had to google what Maccas was wondering if there was a British chain I should keep an eye out for only to learn he was talking about McDonalds.
I feel like this is the closest thing we’ll get to the meme of giving a Victorian era child a taki.
6:16 Everything is bigger in Texas, kid..  God Bless America!!
These reactions make me really proud to be an American 🦅. But young men there is a balance so you don’t have a big back 😂. This is so awesome and genuine I love it.  One kid said I don’t think I can eat food here (in UK) anymore 😂
This video is taking me back to my Grammy's house in Waco during the summer. Thank you so much to all involved with this! Good times indeed!!! 👍🏿👏🏿
3:04 AYO
I'm with some of the fellas on the baked mac and cheese. It ain't the way to go.
3:42 meeeee lol I love pickles!!! 😂
Ollie’s face when that boy said he didn’t like the crispy top of the Mac and cheese 😂😂
How do they do this?  Is the food fresh?
It makes my American heart happy to see they enjoy BBQ. It’s delicious and varies state to state. I hope they can try it in person one day.
And that's why we're so fat.  So delicious.
Didn't do the cornbread justice. It's gotta have the juices from the sides on it
who ever made the corn bread fucked it up L Cornbread
They shoulda eaten it with their hands; tastes better honestly
Need honey butter with the cornbread
As an American. It is fun to see this. And how much i take my home food for granted.
British Sausage is so bland.  This must be orgasmic to them.
I enjoy watching very much, but I have to ask how you get the foods to the kids and have it be eatable and presentable?
I cannot even imagine what it is like for someone who has been eating horrible boring British food their whole life.  Eating Proper Texas BBQ
Never make cornbread ever again?! Oh, my wounded heart!
Fun Fact: if the rib meat falls off the bone without any effort then it is overcooked.
the sheer joy of it all.
Yea, but they have ZEPPELIN!!!!
Never heard of the Texas fold…must try it sometime.
This is why we poured all that tea in the harbor that one time.
They didnt give them sauce ?
They're getting the meat sweats, lol. Those boys are awesome. Headmaster is great too.
America being a melting pot makes it a bit challenging to find the exact things that are uniquely American cultural creations. Barbecue is one of our best.
Welcome to the meat sweats.
I do wonder why the kids are filmed in groups based on complexion. Is that intentional or by chance? Now that it’s been a continuous thing with different people it does seem quite odd. Is this the norm in Britain?
Dam they growing fast asf
Love this video!
The way they all immediately put the beans on the bread 😂
This warms my South Texas heart beyond belief. Love this great state.
You need a pot of pinto beans to go with that cornbread!
I was born and raised in Texas and grew up learning how to cook and ate BBQ, and watching this video warms my heart!
They all need to do a school trip to 4 states with good food.
Keeping in mind the american food industry has gotten the experience of food pleasure down to math from shopping to flavor and chemical pairings and then you expose someone whos been nowhere near as marketed too in such a way and its just such a heavy meal i imagine.
I feel the cornbread was not correct - paper and no flavor that does not track
Another Texan, here! Y'all made us so happy. And your scotch eggs are out of this world! 🍽🤜🤛
Headmaster is more excited than the kids 🤣
God Bless America 🇺🇸
I just love sharing American culture.
They need to come to  South Carolina and have some genuine South Carolina BBQ.
Food orgasm hahahaha
Now tell them the prices for all that food lmao
British people just got it bad over there with food
Like eating a pillow!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
So do brits literally not use seasonings or anything?
im not fond of beans either   lol
Yo, the seventh grader on the left is a legend. He loves everything. 😅
Imagine if America didn’t win the war you guys would’ve had none of this
The one who says hed rather go to mackeys is the adult who still tells americans how his mums split pea and  fizzy wiggins with mustard and fish stew
That's okay hun. You didn't eat real cornbread anyway. Real southern cornbread isn't sweet. It's crunchy on the top and bottom and soft in the middle. No sugar, but smothered in butter.  😘
The British boys are spot on and didn't miss. Ribs rule, pork and then beef. Brisket made that way is to die for. The cornbread is blah compared to what they were eating and should be mixed with beans. The beans, while good, don't compare to ribs.  Mac and cheese is not for everyone. The tea is too sweet. We know that and drink it anyway.
The headmaster seems to have lost weight
The headmaster needs a food review channel
It is hard to make really good cornbread.  A lot of places make it dry or too sweet.  But when you get the balance right, it's hard to beat.  Problem is I'm not sure if they got it right here
Butter that cornbread!  Nobody eats it dry like that.. yike.
Cornbread is very hit or miss even here in the states. Ive had cornbread which I'd eat entirely by itself, and ive had some cornbread where its just like eating a mouthful of sand.
Always love when you guys go to Hogwarts.
nobody likes corn bread. had it once with jalapeno and the was better but usually to dry
MEAT SWEETS...lol
Everything looked great, but wtf was that cornbread?? Y’all just use jiffy, or what?
I’m really curious where they source this Texas bbq in England.
Warm the cornbread then add honey or butter..
“Alright videos over” *back to being little shits*
I live here in USA, and I drooled the whole time I watched this episode 😂
The eyebrows at 5:10
As a born Texan and raised Appalachian I’m a sweet cornbread supremest
Enjoy Brits..😊❤❤
Everything is Bigger and better in Texas.🎉
eyeing the headmaster :) I could watch him eat all day......
These boys make THIS Texan very proud. 😁 They really know how to savor the taste of great food, especially Texas BBQ.
It’s no longer Texas BBQ if it wasn’t made in Texas or was shipped over the Atlantic days ago.
I love their reactions. So glad I stumbled on your channel
Do yall have someone make the fresh foods for the people?
Pork ribs were not cooked properly. Should have cut them up and showed them how to eat em.
Apparently, they made the cornbread wrong. Sweet cornbread is where it's at.
Segregation is still alive eh
I'm so mad because I was in Dallas and it never occured to me to try Texas BBQ... Omg that looks so good ...
Authentic Texas barbecue is served with Dr. Pepper.
Lots of non white british ……… how? Failed UK policy
It’s so funny to me how everyone in the world says “Americans are so fat… why are they so fat” and immediately find out when they do these video😂😂😂
Olli finally finding people complaining about "too much flavor" he's gotta use the years of roasting he's received for the same complaints.
That made me sad  Realizing some people never had that
English food must be very bad.
These are so funny. But it really makes me want BBQ. 🍖
Boys this age, will eat you out of house and home.😃
I'm so glad that everybody gets to try real American food. It's so hard to explain what it is when it's such a hodgepodge of every other culture. I'm just really glad we get to share something that we made with the rest of the world in a positive way
My first Job was in a Pit BBQ in Lewisville Texas. Back in 1982
You gave em Austin Cornbread, cornbread Cake aint Texas, That came from the East coast Northeners.
Doesn't matter race, country, skin color; you put a giant hunk of juicy meat infront of a group of males and they reset to factory default caveman. 😆
This is extremely dangerous!!!!  You could have KILLED those kids with all that flavor!
As a fellow ameraca,
I will grant you, not all cornbread is created equal... same can be said of the beans
Brother looks like brad pitt
I see the bbq sauce, Welcome to America. Let them try the bbq sauce and just the meat
Cornbread tastes so much better with butter 🧈 and honey ✨
I absolutely love the brotherhood and positivity that comes from sitting around food and enjoying each other. Its the small things in life
7:29 part of me thinks they did *_NOT_* give them Jiffy cornbread.
Btw you are feeding Teenagers, have you ever seen a teenager eat?
I knew the Mac and cheese wasn't going to hit for them 10:48
Hold up, where is the bbq sauce
Time to open a Texas BBQ place in London.
They are about to be in for a treat
All I can imagine after watching this video as a wall of Brits running to America and flocking to Texas to get their barbecue 😂😂😂
I love the reaction of their eyes! Cheers!
How to turn a couple of proper UK boys into brothas in one large plate of food. And there is not one thing wrong with that. They have been deprived. These kids are great! So well behaved and well spoken and probably smart.
I sense a franchise opportunity here...
i think its time to give them an entire american BBQ tour - hit all the area specialties, North Carolina style, Kentucky style, Memphis, Kansas City, etc etc...i would expect taste bud explosions everywhere!
Of all the American BBQ, Texas BBQ is the Usain Bolt of Q, the rest are fighting for 2nd.
I also hate beans. Baked beans are the only kind ill eat and even then its minimal.
The best part is that these young folk ate BBQ the best way, no utensils. Just pick it up and get messy.
Texas BBQ brisket is good, but for real BBQ you have to go to Memphis. Real BBQ is pig.
Dave seemed like he got fitter, not after this meal! Love seeing him.
I hope they don't have to go back to class because they're all going to fall into a meat coma. Their parents are going to wonder what happened to them as they drag into the house and go directly to bed!
Did you guys bring  a grill to Britain
Sweet tea is an affront to God, but I still desperately miss bbq being a vegetarian now.
Accurate recreation of July 4 1776
European: All you Americans are fat. (European eats American BBQ)- I get it now and i want to move there.
Any American will tell you, texas has the best BBQ, buy and large. Next time you hear someone bash American food, remember what you tasted, remember how amazing this was.
These are great videos! Keep up the good work 👏
"its like eating papaer" so is eating your shitty food. Not smart enough for science, but they make their food look like tube paste.
I love seeing any other country enjoying the food we love here in America especially Texas Barbeque. I live for it, just makes me believe the world is a little more beautiful every day.
I'm not surprised that some of them didn't like the cornbread. I'm not a fan myself. A bit disappointed over the kids that didn't like the pickles tho. May I ask if they were sweet or dill pickles? I'm a huge fan of dill pickles but I think sweet pickles should be a punishable offense. LOL
You put a huge slab of butter on top of the warm cornbread.
They didn’t have good cornbread then. I had one my mother made the other day, it was SO FREAKING GOOD. Not dry or plain at all. Also, where’s dessert?! LoL Take them some Magnolia Bakery banana pudding, or a peach cobbler!
You should be arrested for Showing British children how Good American food is. 😂❤
These brits have never actually used there taste buds until now 😆
TexMex DDQ could bring peace to the Middle East.
this video has made me feel very proud to be a southern born American man that can smoke meat with the best of them. "and if you don't believe anybody else just ask me"  I'll be 70 in August. my pop used to cook pork shoulders on the smoker of course and I loved it and I was hooked ever since I was a kid. and some Texas brisket cooked with Post Oak oh my goodness you have got it going on there. I live in Southwest Florida two of my daughters live in southern Texas and yeah we can all cook like crazy
Eat up fellas! And get fat like us too lol
I feel the meat sweats coming. lol Just had Terry Black's BBQ in Fort Worth, Texas yesterday. Perfect timing.
I agree with no pickles on a Texas fold
Guys, next time serve the cornbread smothered in butter and honey!
I’m upset they didn’t put more Bbq sauce on EVERYTHING😂😂
seeing the happiness on those faces makes it all worth  it
I’m hoping they’ll begin to understand why it’s so hard to say no to food in America. Cut us a bit of slack on the obesity bit. Not excusing it but understand the challenge is hard. We’re sadly experiencing a perpetual feast like it’s the holidays. The land of plenty that has perfected food flavor.
As someone who has been living in Austin for almost 4 years this makes me sooo happy to watch. I love Texas barbecue and watching another culture experience and love it as much as me makes me smile ear to ear😊
They've never had real food before!
Imagine having a school day where people bring Texas bbq to you lol
You do know that the kids are actors, right? How can they give them American food without being here? Once I saw them get handed a wrapper with a burger from Wendy’s. That must have been 24 hours old in the best of circumstances.
As a Texan I approve this video ❤ Brisket is my favorite.
You too can have Texas BBQ in the UK.  Just weld up a smoker with an offset firebox and dry rub a brisket with salt and pepper.  Use a hardwood of your choice.  Keep the temp around 275-300f.  Smoke it unwrapped and don't lift the door for at least 3 hours.  Wrap it and bring it up to at least 205f internal temp and don't take it out until it is floppy.  Pull it and let it rest for at least 45 min.  You're welcome.
Bro you guys should learn how to do bbq and open a restaurant in the uk
Texan here, since 2000. I’m not the biggest fan of cornbread either. The flavor is nice but the texture ruins it unless it’s really moist
Low-key, all of them just realized they moms and grandparents can't cook. Think about it
What the heck do British people usually eat? I would probably have to live off of fish and chips if i went there.
Now they need to try it cooked
Do you see why we're all so fat now?
Whyt Europeans put food together that don't make any sense same here in America like bake beans and toast?
#20 on trending! Good job guys!
You need to soak the cornbread in bean or meat juice. It's dry by itself. 😂😂😂
As a lifelong Texan, I've never heard "Texas Fold" before in my life.
A blk person didn't make that macaroni and chz.  And why was they talking about runny macaroni and chz
Nothing makes me feel more patriotic than seeing Brits enjoy our food lol
Why are the black kids always segregated?
The kid tearing up from the brisket sums up Texas BBQ 🥹
I can’t believe y’all gave them kids dry cornbread and no whipped butter or brown sugar butter with it. And they ate it DRY. 😂 That was criminal. 😂
These videos are so insulting.
all of them are definitely going to visit Texas one day for that bbq
These boys are going to spend the rest of their lives longing for these foods.
Dog I'm so glad you guys came to America tried everything you guys could found the best recipes to bring back to these kids that is awesome
Once I got my smoker I only use my grill to sear now….I cook all my meat in the smoker. Ill sear it on the grill after for a nice bark. NY Strips smoked for 40 mins then seared and put a dab of butter on top when resting it. Ypu will never cook steak any other way once you have this.
Everything is better in Texas Lol the boy who said his eyes were watering had me rolling 😂😂
1:40 “burnt ends”!! Yumm Check out Raspberry-Chipotle pork bunt ends & (Texas Monthly winning) brisket at 1775 Texas Pit BBQ in College Station. Worth the drive!! (And must get cornbread casserole) 🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧
A pickle is a cucumber.  Theres a difference between whyt southern from blk people southern food bc we season our food. Whyt folks in America ancestors are from Europe so they don't season that much here but I'm sure nothing like Europe.
Actually Texas cornbread is hit or miss. I can tell that cornbread was kind of dry. It shorts melt in your mouth like cake
Just remember if anyone tells you there's BBQ that isn't Texas style, they are lying to you. Everything else is vinegar sauce and ketchup on burnt meat. Texas BBQ is the only barbecue.
Cornbread is gross
With the Texas fold, at his first bite,  the headmaster was trying to fold his eyes😂😂😂🎉.. Lmao, the beef got their eyes watery❤❤
So much better than fish in newspaper and mushy peas... welcome to Texas yall
Not liking cornbread is very British.  Maybe throw some beans on it.  Which is sort of what you're supposed to eat the cornbread with.
They made the corn bread incorrectly. It needs cream of corn in it. That's true, American corn bread 🤤
The headmaster is always the best of all!
Before they even tried the corn bread i could tell they didnt make it right. To dry but everything else looked spot on.
Kid at 8 min explaining the mop and the cornbread was an excellent analogy for a kid. It was brilliant actually.
Why exactly are the students segregated? It seems the food is a common experience for them.
Next time eat the beans with the cornbread
Headmaster needs a smoke and a cold shower now. 😂
Curly hair kid is great.
Lolol
They are too funny and adorable 😂
To be fair as a new englander that was new to corn bread when I moved to the south, I came to love corn bread, but I have to have lots of butter on it 😊
What do they eat in the Britain if they’ve never had any of these foods?!
You have ruined all food at home for these kids.
I'm a Texas man, but I've never tied cornbread with BBQ. Now pinto beans? That's different!
Sweet lord butter your corn bread 🤣
wait....WHAT!?!?! are pickles not a thing in england?
I'm happy for these kids. They'll never have this again unless they travel to the U.S.
Why are these videos so entertaining
Oh Saily sounds like a sale for me. That’s awesome.
I think they need to try a northern-style cornbread smothered with butter and honey.  Now *that* is like a cake.
Enjoy your curries 🤮
"Sublime" and "mesmerizing" are great words for it.
Tbf they should have had them eat the sides before the meat. Anything after that meat is going to be underwhelming lol
Eating burnt ends for the first time is such a spiritual experience. The definition of meat candy
please try senza fondo in london! they do bottomless lasagne and it is gorgeous
Here in America Headmaster means something totally different lmao
Put some butter on that cornbread
Anything is better than their canned baked beans over toast!
lol they are going to have the meat sweats lol
Such a great headmaster😊😊 Love watching the British highschoolers try american food😁😁 Such messy food and no napkins? If it was me I would have mountain napkins!
"im still comprehending the flavours" this meal would've murdered a Victorian child 😭
Now they know why we are fat
We don't put beans on toast. But if you pair those beans with southern potato salad 👌
Where did you get Texas BBQ I Britain?
I was introduced to brisket when I was in a living history group in Texas.  We went to another historic site and they fed us BBQ.  Brisket, beans, sausage, and corn bread.  Fell in love with the brisket.  Another time we arrived much earlier, and I got to see how they prepared it.  They were using a smoker that was the size of an old fashioned locomotive boiler, and were carefully arranging the briskets to allow the smoke to circulate.  I believe they were using mesquite, but that is not required.  After I found out how uncomplicated it was, I started trying it at home, downsizing from the industrial size smoker.  It is delicious.  The trick is cooking low and slow, which requires keeping a watch on the fire.
Can we get these kids (and the hosts by surprise) on a massively reduced spicyness version of HotOnes? @HotOnes @Jolly collab?
They would probably like Jiffy cornbread better
Hello from Texas. Thanks, fellas. Brisket is a Texas staple, but it gets even better than this.
The kids are cute 🥰.
And they all took a looooonnnggg nap as soon as the camera went off.....😂😂😂
Texas barbeque is more often than not eaten outdoors. It has become the quintessential Texas outdoor gathering. For more context.
They're gonna sleep good😂
Put some butter on that cornbread!
Hey! The headmaster looks different. What has changed?
What do you feed these poor kids?  Do an a third world edition
We don’t eat dry ass corn bread either lol 😂 need some butter or honey
I love that these videos keep getting top viewership on Jolly because it means they’ll keep bringing back these kids
The British school boys are so cute eating Texas BBQ ❤
I don’t like corn bread either. Kids are smart.
I want him at my school so badly
You could tell the cornbread was trash. Fresher the better
I MISS THIS SO MUCH😭😭🙏🙏
Logistically, how did they pull this off? Did they go to the barbecue or did the barbecue come to them? Is there Texas BBQ in the UK?
The inability of British people to not put beans on toast/bread is super funny to me.
It is amusing to see the properly dressed schoolmaster digging into the bbq with his hands.  At first I thought that they were not provided with utensils, but then I saw some on the plates.  They forgot to mention that those were the small platters at a Texas BBQ.
Great job, team!  None of us likes everything but you guys definitely rose to the occasion on the brisket, ribs and pork. Texas Fold was epic!  Your Headmaster has done well with y'all. Cheers! PS -  Summer field trip to Texas in the offing?
Your subtitles are off track because of the promo in the middle, might want to fix that.
“Stop making cornbread”  *clutches pearls*
What these children don't know is they just been introduced to chrmicals for the first time. OF COURSE THEIR GOING TO LIKE IT.
I love this! Come on over kids and Headmaster to Texas to eat your fill!! I have lived in Texas for 53 years and love Texas BBQ!❤❤❤
My Texan father cooks his briskets overnight for 18 hrs. They melt in your mouth. 🍖🥩
Not liking cornbread is crazy  Edit: and no Mac and cheese?!?!
Get some butter on the corn bread
As a Texan 🤠 this was wonderful to watch!! Cornbread must have butter and honey 🍯!! Or it can be dry 😂
This is how I was when I experienced my 1st snow bunny😂😂
The kids may like the cornbread better by adding softened butter and honey! ❤
Cornbread can be hit or miss, honestly. It can be bland or dull or in some rare cases, it's as sweet as dessert cake. It's really the best hot right out of the oven and butter on top. Pour meat chili or beans or pulled pork on top of the cornbread and it makes a great foundation. In Florida, we call these "Smoke stacks" or "Junkyard Platter".
I NEED TO TASTE THIS CORNBREAD ASAP
Texan here. I'm happy they got to eat some good. BBQ. We don't all drink sweet tea though. That's a myth.
I was raised on Texas brisket. Prime rib and brisket are my favorite!
Young blonde man #1, I agree, we should disown cornbread entirely.
Not giving them sumn sweet (not the tea) after that is a crime 😭😭 they needed a sweet potato pie to finish that off 🤣🤣🤤
I've always wanted to visit Texas and this video really makes me want to visit. I hope you guys don't mind a Canadian coming down to try your BBQ.
As a Texan here you make feel even more prouder to live in texas
Not high schoolers at 7 yo.
This is where we eat the beans you Brits eat for breakfast!
Howdy y’all, as a native Texan, I can confidently say that we are proud of our BBQ. I think it is awesome that you have those kids try our food. The thing about our BBQ is that nobody does it the same and it is almost always good. Too bad they don’t get some good ol chicken leg quarters. I believe they would have enjoyed that as well. Pulled pork would have also been a good one. Thanks for the video.
It's funny to me how they don't like the krispy topping on the mac and cheese.  My mom uses Ritz crackers and I always want to scrape the top off the entire  casserole dish.
You all finally see why we are all fat?
They did not have the right corn bread I’ve had some that’s like cake w out frosting please try again 😂😢
Now you know why 35% of Texans are obese. I could eat that everyday.
I’ve been waiting for this!!!
My mouth is watering as I watch this.
Must be some bad cornbread.  Cornbread is really easy to make too.  Hopefully, that was sugar-free cornbread.  Cornbread should be savory and tastes great with homemade chili, especially leftover chili.
This is one reason why the US is now the world’s only superpower and Great Britain is not. We have better food, especially Texas barbecue.
"It's really bland.", so it should make you feel right at home then...
I was visiting family in Texas last week. I had some good Tex-Mex, but didn't get around to brisket. 😞
They like beans straight from the can BETTER than those baked beans? Po' children.😂
I wish we had teachers in the USA like this head master we did this video with @beehelpers197 god help the kids at schools! 😢
Ha ha, you can really tell how similar human beings are because these kids have WILDLY different tastes on things like chocolate, nuts, sugar, heck even CORNBREAD, but meat well-cooked on flame is a shared human experience. Also, it's hilarious how all the kiddos instinctively make beans on toast, ha ha. Such Brits.
As a Texas Native Im proud ain’t no Bar BQ like southern Texas
You can butter your cornbread
Texas here. Y'all forgot the butter on the bread. 😂
Ooooh, these kids were getting a real treat.
Beans, cornbread, and ranch is something I grew up with. Back in the 90s everyone would eat it the same
This makes my Texas heart proud ❤️❤️
Cornbread is gross and gritty
Obese starter kit!
American Heart Attack on the plate.
lol 4:33 "the pickles ruin it" that there is 100% an afro reply to pickles. Our tongues are not design for pickles, I don't know how to explain it but I have not come across any black-folk that loves pickles. First time I had a burger King as a kid, I spit it out without knowing why & after tasting all the parts i found the pickle to be the culprit.
The kid with the curly hair is like that’s lovely every 10 seconds
The Headmaster will be applying for a job in Texas… 🤣😂😂
@jolly you guys made me hungry and I actually have a rack of pork ribs in my freezer. I’m gonna pull those out and I’m gonna let them defrost. I’m gonna have me some barbecue. I’m not from Texas. I’m from the state that sits right above Texas I’m from Oklahoma and I tell you what being a souther we love some good barbecue
Wait! No dessert? Banana pudding or peach cobbler? Oh well, loved their reactions anyway.
Is there an underline situation in the UK?? Why are these boys separated by race???? I bet you never noticed?? Because you're so use to it??? THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM
Next, the Camelot of BBQ: Kansas City.
background music on point haha
And what I would do is, I would get a pot of seasoned pinto beans with your onion, your garlic, your salt, your pepper, whatever herbs, and spices you wanna add to it and I would serve the cornbread up with the bowl of pinto beans and always remember to drop a pot of butter in the pinto beans as well as on the cornbread and I like to eat those together those are elite together
It’s almost like American food has flavor.
You have to butter the cornbread and it has to be warm when you serve it and you have to you know eat it as you go along and not wait till the very end or it’s gonna be too cold and well if there’s no butter on it then he’s right it’s like eating sandpaper cardboard
‘Mmm… I just love syoutisjes’ hahaha
Honestly, I wish our  young kids looked and acted and spoke like this in America. The best thing is uniforms. Proper English and respectful.😮
It’s CHILI!!!!
To be honest, with how well all that food was cooked, my mouth would be watering as well. Most ribs are not fall off the bone tender.
The kid who asked that cornbread never be made again may have started an interview incident
“There’s a taste to it” yes, we call that flavor. so glad to see them having some good stuff
Me being from Texas and watching these young men enjoy and relish Texas barbecue just makes me want to send them barbecue so never be without ever again. I love it. I might have to move to England to open up a barbecue restaurant!
As a typical American, I will say that English highschoolers have a more expansive vocabulary than their American counterparts.
Im so glad i hit the play button best video today
where did they get this bbq from so i can buy it
When can we get another video of the og highschoolers? We need more of them back on
This just goes to show the agenda at play these days.  Even in England, they just have to add minorities and use them in 50%, and usually more, of all media.  We're seeing the 13% in nearly 87% of all media in the States.  That's an agenda, and it's disgusting.
Corn bread isn’t a bbq thing. It’s best with something that makes juice like greens, cabbage and potato, beans and the like.
How do they get the food there lol
You can get bbq like this in most of North America. What you can get in only one place is cochon de lait. Yes, other places cook whole hog. Again the flavors, while good, are not really unique. But Louisiana does everything food its own special way. I made this comment before. Yall should arrange to go to a Louisiana style hog butchering. The entire animal is processed into sausages (including read and white boudin), Tasso all while having a family feast and making music. You won’t experience anything like it any where else.
DANG! My mouth watered 20 seconds in😂
OFFICIAL PETITION for the PICKLE BOYS to grow up and take over JOLLY 😂😂😂
Way better than tea and sandwiches.
British people experience flavor and spices is my favorite genre of video.
No one’s talking about eating the fold from the top…
One of them called it "sublime". That is a descriptive word for you.
I understand their reactions to cornbread. I love it, but it has to be soaked in butter and honey. 😂
They look like harry potter students seeing REAL magic for the first time. 😊
So they don't have pickles in England?
Harry is my favorite. Such a cutie patootie. And his reactions are hilarious! He looks like Goob from Meet the Robinsons.
British Children Try Flavor for the First Time
“I don’t think I can eat food here anymore”. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Best comment ever!!!
Is it just me or does Harry look like Goob from Meet the Robinsons?? 😂😂😂
Well i for one, don't like cornbread either. I rather have some hot water corn bread with jelly or corn cakes with honey...the regular one..is dry to me....and no its not like my mom couldn't make it...everyone swears it's cak,  lol just not my cup of tea
"Trying to sneak beef into everything" - Yeah that describes us very well.
@11:42 😂 Whats in it? Well you got your beans........and pit!
Headmaster deserves it all. Truly an exemplary individual
It took no time at all for them to eat bbq like a Texan. Well done.
Best food in the world, hands down. Love some awesome texas BBQ
You guys just ruined those kids they'll never get that again unless they come to America 😂😂😂😂
More proof that europe needs to consider sending some people to america to learn good bbq. Imagine a chain of texas style bbq resturants in britain. They would make serious bank in no time.
I genuinely love this show and when any of the say "This is why Americans are all fat" ........... yes, thats is the correct answer...THANK YOU
I'm in America and I'm jealous lol where tf is this brisket. I'm in savannah, GA (born and raised southern) and I have maybe come across brisket cooked that beautifully a handful of times in my life lol.
That cornbread must have not been sweet
I always wonder how these Brits leave this tasting table and manage to go back to Heinz beans on toast. Like living in a mansion and moving to a Red Roof Inn.
"What age can you move to America", you really ought to express your love from afar to be honest hahaha
There are some really good pitmasters in the UK now. Wilson's BBQ does quite a few YouTube videos on Texas BBQ and I think he still does event catering. PRO Smoke in the UK has BBQ classes and they sell what ever you need to make BBQ. They also collaborate with a lot of BBQ chefs and creators from around the world including Texas, Austaralia, UK, Argentina and many others. I'm pretty sure they can recommend a decent BBQ restaurant in the UK.
I will say cornbread tastes a lot better when eaten with other foods not just by its self
why did you group the kids like that?? some particular reason??
Man, the cornbread hate 😭😂
At 9:56, "Americans are really go big or go home."  For better or worse it's true.
Did you warm them all of the meat sweats? Or, how they'll be ready to pass out after viewing down like that? We love all kinds of BBQ in the US, but most of us only have it on special occasions.
I got a little upset when he pressed on the brisket :(
I’m from Virginia & I’ve had Virginia BBQ of course but even I want to try authentic Texas BBQ went on a roadtrip last year & drove through Houston but didn’t even stop to try any 🤦🏽‍♂️
Making my stomach growl watching this! I have a great BBQ spot a few minutes south of here in the OBX, NC. May have to hit it up today.
As a American kinda heart warming to see them enjoy bbq cuz a lot of us in the south are really passionate bout that grill. You guys should’ve added some North Carolina sauce to give a lil difference but great vid
Jalapeño cornbread is fire.
As an American, I couldn't stop smiling while watching this
They all make fun of fat Americans until they eat the food.
I vote for an American field trip for the whole school!  🎉
At 6:36, Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance" is playing in the background.  Granted it is a British tune, but here in the States it is quite common for it to be played at high school graduation ceremonies.  So, it is fitting for this episode since the kids are "graduating" their taste buds to new flavors and textures. 🎓
Table manners go out the door in the presence of finger lickin food.  XD
No banana pudding?
Are these recipes original?  As in, the bread. Is it full of sugar like the real American one?  Btw, to the Americans. We in Europe don't buy your beef because of all the hormone treating, etc. Do you have places in the US where you can get actual farm cows, fed on grass and no roids etc?
Protip: Don't go to Texas for pork bbq, they specialize in beef bbq.
these poor kids never having this before.
The video, British high schoolers experience texas comedy scene,  has been forbidden by British law.  As well as British high schoolers experience American toothbrushes
At 1:56 "It's sublime."  😂  That's great!  Grew up in Texas and have traveled all over the US and a bit of Canada and had smoked brisket all over.  But never have I heard it described as "sublime", yet,  that's what it is down Texas way (and in Kansas City). 😋
no talking about that kid who said Ollie is the funny one?
So, how long before the meat sweats kicked in ?  😂
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore!" Priceless
British people in here realizing why Americans are fat. 😋
Brisket is so expensive now 😢 used to be cheap cut
They will be knocked out in an hour lol
In 2022 I had the privilege of taking two chaps from the UK to a Texas Monthly top ten bbq joint in Houston, and they had very similar reactions. It was a lot of fun!
I meant two Scottish kids at my store the other day and I was so enamored on asking them everything that they’ve tried while being here I gave them so many recommendations for food. They came back the next day. And was over the moon about Taquerias 😂😂😂😂 and bbq
The pickles kids grew up fast from last year, wow.
This is one of many reasons I could never go vegetarian.
Raised in the midwest/south (Arkansas), had cornbread at almost every meal and big event.....cornbread SUCKS. I know it's a staple for a lot of people, but I never understood the appeal of a dry, tasteless carb. The only way I can stomach it is in a casserole that involves cheese, onion, tons of extra seasonings/fat. It just doesn't make sense to me.
As a Texan I'm glad to see y'all enjoying our BBQ... Texas has the BEST BBQ... PERIOD!
The bread is basically just an edible napkin
the subtitles are all wrong.
As a Texan I appreciate the response of pure satisfaction of trying Texas BBQ
WHITE PEOPLE CORNBREAD IDENTIFIED LMAOOO  BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE CORNBREAD IS SWEET LIKE CAKE AND SUPER SOFT AND FLUFFY LOL
These kids will be chasing this type of flavor for years to come until they can go to TX themselves 🤣
Ruled across the globe, never learned to use the spices.    North CarolinaVinegar based bbq sauce on a pulled pork sandwich with a spicy pickle is the go to!  Cornbread is great with pinto beans.
British people try food with flavor for the first time
As a native Texan, I approve this video
I absolutely love watching the Head Master and the High Schoolers,they are innocent but,  truly give you their opinions! It looked delicious I must say!!
I'm from Texas and so glad you all enjoyed our state food.  You're not eating the cornbread properly.  You need to slice that cornbread in half (long ways) and just slather it with butter.  Add some honey and you've got dessert.
I really love Asian & Spanish food but my god American bbq is the best thing ever!!!!
Why, why, why,,,, is this so entertaining?  Everytime?   Must be Jolly…🍕
Brief history of Texas or Southern BBQ. Most (not all) of these BBQ cooking techniques were created by Slaves. The cuts of Beef and Pork were discarded or used for stew, soup, or sausage because they were considered unpalatable otherwise by white settlers, farmers, or plantation owners.
That tea was not dark enough it looked like have lemonade lol
This made me smile...thank you.
Living in texas and always having access to this kind of meal, i can tell you, there are levels of bbq. Terrible. Good. And gotta have it.
This is what America means to me! I’m not from Texas, however, Ohio has their own version of barbecue that makes me feel proud to know these kids are willing and excited to experience such a staple in many peoples lives. The diversity of food and how to make it never ceases to amaze me. Continue to explore coolest foods in America! 🫡
Y’all. Need sweet southern cornbread. Top with butter when it’s hot so it melts & top w Karl syrup!!  Desert delicious!!
Lol that one kid says " i don't think i can eat food here anymore" lol oh my goodness poor kid he will be sad everytime be eats lol
The corn bread needs butter or honey butter or honey Jalapeno to give it more flavor cuz not everyone makes it taste that good sometimes people can make it too dry
You can't serve cornbread plain! You've either got a melt some real salted butter on that s*** or cook it with jalapenos and cheddar cheese inside🎉 jalapeno cheddar cornbread is like the best thing on this planet well except for barbecued brisket🎉😂❤
You should tell them this is why most Americans are over weight
Try Phila cheesesteaks
Try some Pennsylvania Dutch food
Cornbread is good, but I agree with some of them. Why fill up on any bread, when you have all of that heaven in front of you. I don’t get salad at all buffet though so…
I feel so bad for British people
Never come to America It's dangerous here now. Ugh
What is wrong with you people, BUTTER THE CORNBREAD FOR F SAKE !!!!! 😕
Love that they immediately put the beans on toast lmao
If they didn't like cornbread, you didn't make it right. ;-) glad they liked everything else though.
Hey now Sir!!! I am from North Carolina and you can't talk about CORNBREAD that way OK?!?! Now I love Brisket and must say I really enjoyed watching y'all experience it.
I love it when the kids say “this is lovely” the look of total enjoyment on there faces is priceless ❤
Any American-Mexican here?
You're supposed to put butter on the cornbread.
I mean I feel the kids, northern cornbread is so much nicer than southern cornbread.
Shouldve gave them sliders, man.
“All for the ride” kid will go far! Great attitude!
Great video! Those kids looked amazed!
I love cornbread
Oooh, that kid who said "never make cornbread again," is looking for a food war, man. Southern belle moms will hear about this. 😂
Cornbread is meant to soak up juices or beans. It’s a world of difference from eating it plain.
These are the most spoiled kids in UK
Where is british students? I only see immigrants😂
Ollie and Andy being ambassadors of American food for England is the best thing ever
Now you understand why my ancestors left in the 1600s.  We could make whisky anywhere.
Apparently a Texan needs to move to the UK and open a BBQ joint. They'd clean up!
Bbq turkey is the best.
Should have taken them Kansas City bbq
I wish these jolly guys would find a get cornbread right. It is served hot with butter melting on it. You always have butter with your cornbread!!!🙄
You're welcome Brits lol one love ❤l Texas BBQ is amazing!!!! Beans and toast come on 😂
Put honey or honey butter on cornbread!!
Are you sure mack is 9 years old dude be hitting puberty at 7 years of age
I was hoping they brought pork ribs. Far superior to beef ribs.
That kid that hated on cornbread, you are barred from ever visiting the South. This is a public service announcement. 🤣🤣🤣
I Miss you Ollie ❤❤ u make my day ❤❤❤
Watched this while broke and hungry. Imagine my belly rumbling
Those brothas got southern accents real fast! Lol
THIS is why we Americans are so overweight.  (It's not all McDonalds' fault.)
Don't let brits know we have food with flavor, they'll try to recolonize us.
Really blow their minds by introducing the different BBQs from state to state in the south!
Amazing experience for those boys! Only criticism is that the cornbread should have been served with butter and honey.
How are these kids 7,8, and 9 years old and in high school?
As an American watching this, I had a smile on my face the whole time and to top it off, Jolly and their responses were amazing.
Try adding a half of a tin of creamed corn,  half of a diced onion, 1/4-1/2 of a cup of diced jalapenos, and some diced pimentos into your cornbread batter.  The extra ingredients add moisture, texture, flavor, and spice to it. ETA or you can just add some shredded cheese to the batter.
Grrrrrrr...GRRRRRRR!!!
"Please never make cornbread ever again."  ROFL Little man, you are hereby banned from the South. LMFAO
Had Texas BBQ like a month ago. I really underestimated how good that food was, and i'm sorry Texas people, i was not familiar with yo game
As a native Texan, it is wonderful to see the "faith of Smoke and Beef" spread to the rest of the world. I have seen it in New Zealanders, Japanese, Koreans and Pakistanis. I have never seen one group of people (except possibly Vegans) fail to grasp the miracle of Texas BBQ.
I would have kicked out the kid who said he rather go to Macys what ever the f that is
As an Australian i can certainly say the cirn bread is delicious even though its very dense
Southerner here. You have no idea how much we love seeing people eat our food and love it.
They won this time? Man we up on everything check the scoreboard
Just soul food.
Bro just casually ruined these kids lives! They will spend the rest of their lives forever wanting, having tasted nirvana and they will never experience this type of bliss again lest they travel to the US or strike it rich and hire private chefs but even *then* they may not be able to recreate these flavor profiles again!
I wish it was a food i haven't ate yet that is as good as BBQ! that's bliss!
Food comas for all!
They realize why Americans are fat.
God I love being Texan
These kids and most of Europe is apparently starved from eating food with no actual flavor. Acting like they’ve never had true good food before.
so glad they finally got real food to the kids across the pond
Then they wonder why we are huge as hell lol
As a Texan, I'm with him on the mac and cheese. I've never liked the breadcrumbs, or really any other toppings on mac and cheese. It's just unnecessary. No need to corrupt mac and cheese with flavorless bread crumbs.
They never had good food before obviously
Next, they are going know what the "Itis" is. Let's just say they are gonna need a pillow and blanket after eating that 😂
My mouth is watering watching this.
I love these videos.  These young men are great; so positive and enthusiastic.
Can we get a reverse series of taking Korean High School Students to England?
Harry looks like the spit image of Goob from "Meet the Robinsons"
“That’s lovely” kid didn’t talk at all he was straight business
❤💯❤💯
Where's the bit of sugar in the corn bread makes "Johnny Cake"
Somewhere in Texas, a cowboy just smiled and whispered, ‘They get it.’ 🤠🔥
My man Harry just likes food lol respect
The kids: "This is okay" "I like british ____ better" The Headmaster: "Oh my god" "Thats amazing"
british food looks crap ... eatting like they lost the war
They are so cute to watch
Now y'all know why Americans are overweight, our food is good, its really really good.
Please bring the headmaster to the US we welcome him ❤ 😂
Baked beans and mac n cheese together ❤️
This is the poster child for “British food is bland”
Get that Headmaster to Texas or America for a food trips
The mil bucket analogy 😂
Reminds my first visit to Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse in Texas. I feel bad for these kids the first time they have to use the bathroom, not as bad as guest on Hot Ones, but its going to be rough.
Why did the first kid put the burnt ends in his mouth with his fingers like he was spider spinning a web? Lol
Anyone else want to see them take headmaster to a state fair in the us? 😂
lol this was wonderful
That’s why Americans eat our cornbread with butter and honey. Or ladened with jalapeños and cheese.
badly roasted meat I would say charred, with flatates which are carcinogenic
Is anyone having problems with subtitles or is it me 5:05
Their reactions were amazing.
I bet that wasn't sweet corn bread and it was without butter. 🤣😂 Absolutely disgraceful.
These aren’t high schoolers
"Tryna sneak beef inta everyfing" welcome to the USA 🦅🦅🦅🦅
I love seeing foreigners getting their hands on US Classics. Everyones dissing us like "Why are americans so fat???" And then they taste classic Smokehouse BBQ and they're like "I understand now."
These young men loves their food so much, bless their hearts and stomachs 🥩🥩🥩
And this is why I love my country.
Them boys walking around to this day dreaming about that one time they ate good food
OMG, you're supposed to put butter on cornbread. Lol.
We call that the meat sweats! Enjoy!
“The flavor just last for ages” 💀😭
Cornbread has to be served hot with butter
Hey.....give them some southern beans.... black eye peas with smoke meat or pinto beans with smoke meat I wish I could make them some cornbread
To hear these young men of our future speak so properly, priceless!  Covering their mouths after stuffing their faces while speaking. Even though the uniforms are the same; personal style is encouraging.
The problem with the cornbread (I'm assuming) is it needs to be hot, with butter melting on it. Or, you can break up chunks, and drop them into a glass of milk. Then eat it with a spoon, out of the glass.
buck tooth close your mouth
8:17 this kid gets it
Welcome to America bbq is the best food
American kids, takes NOTES! this type of attitude will gain you respect in real life.
Welcome to America. This is why we left yall 250+ years ago.
1:23 the guy on right for sec looked like young brad pit 😳
Need some honey butter on that cornbread
Cornbread is more of a bread you serve with chili. And the thick white bread you serve there needs to be lightly toasted on one side in butter. That's called Texas Toast- much more appropriate for TX BBQ
God bless the USA and God bless the UK
Over cooked
Feh - probably gave them cornbread without any sugar. Best cornbread isn't even sweet cornbread, it's a slight addition of sugar and NOT DRY - the worst cornbread is dry cornbread.
Cornbread goes good with beans.
As far as the corn bread is concerned it’s so so so many different kinds, I love and make a sweet cake-like cornbread. But there’s jalapeño and cheese, there’s some with bits of corn which is usually sweet, there’s savory kinds, but yes sometime it’s that dry bland kind too
NO WAY THOSE ARE BRITISH HIGH SCHOOLERS  THEY ARE TO TINY
6:55 his greed sickens me…. but as an american i understand
why does the headmaster look younger and younger 😂😂💜
This is a perfect example of joy being double folded (Texas folded). My joy came from witnessing their joy😂
MACK IS BRAD PITT
Harry’s “that looks lovely” and “I think my eyes are watering” were the cutest freaking things 🥹🥹🥹
No Texas twinkies is insane!
Great  Britain conquered the world for spices and use non of them on food
You should eat cornbread slightly sweet, warm with butter on it. Yummmmmm
We need a petition to get Mr. Smith to America
1:19 how are these guys 9 yo?? They look a lot older.
It’s always nice to see people who haven’t been exposed to much US cuisine be given the Heaven on a Plate™ that is good ol’ American Barbecue
This is so cute. I was living in Texas for 11 years and I just moved Arizona. It makes my heart feel good to see these kids loving barbecue so much. Ribs are one of my favorite foods and I make them quite often. Ribs are actually really easy to make if you don’t have a smoker or bbq grill, you can do it right in your oven. I have an instant pot and I season and cook them for 30 minutes in the instant pot and then transfer them to the oven with barbecue sauce for another 20 minutes and they are falling off the bone perfect and delicious
Ngl that Mac and cheese looked horrible 😂
5:04 A Brit going on vacation to Portugal... how surprising.
How do they make simple words like “nice” and “lovely” seem so sophisticated and genuine
Growing up in America I remember the first time I had bbq and man it’s life changing hahahahaha
2:52 “You’re the funny one” took me out
Mac & Cheese..."You like it more bland?"  lol
Wait till they try our whiskey
Mack looks 13 going on 30. He's the guy we'd get to buy beer growing up
There are different types of Corn Bread just as there are different types of Mac & cheese. Some corn breads are sweet, some are more bland, some are neither. Honey Butter + Raspberry Butter are great to have with it (mix em).
Corn bread without butter is a sin
You should try some cornbread casserole
Corn bread is best with butter and Kool-Aid!
You guys need to go to Buffalo, New York & make the rounds for different wings & beef on ‘weck sandwiches!!
Southside BBQ in Elgin, Texas is the best barbecue in the world! Right outside of Austin Tx! 😊😊
Headmaster is definitely in it just for the food now 😁   Now y'all HAVE TO bring him to Texas!
The cornbread needs butter on it
Welcome to America...
Other countries beginning to realize why all of us in the US are so obese, lmao.
PLEASE bring Mr. Smith to America, he is GOLD!
It's not Bangers & Mash.
Someone should open a Texas BBQ in the UK, even all of Europe! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍♥️
The mammoth mountain shirt is crazy
Kansas City BBQ is so much better
The cornbread look dry as hell it need some honey butter
Excellent harbingers of American culture.
The subtitle not match because of the ads. You guys doesn't sync after add the ads scene
11:06 Ollies face after he didn’t like the crusty Mac was incredible, went through the stages of grief in a second😭😂😂
You have to use the Jiffy Cornbread, add a little sugar maybe brown sugar depending how you like it, add milk and let the over do the rest
I promise..dont move to america, especially now lmao
For God's sake, Guys, put some damn butter on that corn bread.
yoooo you got them to eat biscuits and gravy??? W video lol
Beautiful honest response ❤😂
The cornbread taste good with butter
You guys are honorary Americans by the way you subtly roast the students and head master for their lack of exposure to flavor 😂
❤😂
Im not a fan of regular corn bread either I like sweet corn bread (some call it northern corn bread) or hot water corn bread.
Are they really highschoolers? Look like middle school to me.
That must of not been sweet cornbread.  And I don't like crumbs on my Mac and cheese. And I'm a Texan
Come on.....😊🎉
Too funny! Most of them wanted to come here or be kidnappedand taken here! Lol!
Funny how proud I am when people love Texas bbq just because I’m a Texan. I don’t even eat meat! 😹😭 about a decade long vegetarian and I still miss spicy chopped brisket in a stuffed baked potato 🤤😹
These kids will never taste anything as good as that ever again.
not everything is better in America but the food sure is. especially when it comes to smoking on a smoker or on a grill
Boys need to put some butter or honey on the cornbread.
There's supposed to be butter with the corn bread.
That one kid has the perfect upper front teeth for ribs! ✊✊🔥
lay off the cornbread hate now
Don't feel bad I don't like the crispy top either.. real Southern mac and cheese has no bread crumbs 🤢
2:40 this boy looks like goob kid version in "meet the robinsons". my favorite character.
12:39 buddy sounded like a hobbit or something 😂
Texan here, Texas monthly just came out with the top 50 bbq places in Texas. You guys should bring the kids to Texas 😊
I've been waiting for these young men to have this food experience. Their reactions did not disappoint.
USA, USA, USA...
MURICA🦅🦅🦅🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸
I wish you'd start with the sides! It seems underwhelming after the show stopper meats.
that so funny, the kid said he wants to move to america. thats so funny.
FYI, CC is about a minute ahead of the video. In CC, at 6:44 : "It's really bland, it's like eating paper." That moment in the video is actually at 7:46.
How did they get fresh cooked Texas BBQ all the way to a school in England?
Being a true Texan,  8th generation.  I love watching people try our food.
the only cornbread i'll eat is sweet cornbread or crush it into a bowl and put ham and beans with it.
Pickles in the milkshake, sounds like British food.
Jolly be milking these kids for content
Now explain what the ITIS is when everyone wakes up 😅
Somebody needs to move to England and open up a restaurant like this. I’m there if anybody’s game servers place to rent let me know I’ll do any of it.😂
13:49 listen here little brother my 92 year old grandma can make the most beautiful cornbread ever
The cornbread needed butter!
Ive never met a single person tnat doesnt like BBQ
11:05 Texas bbq Mac n cheese put some coleslaw and bbq sauce
why are the subtitles telling me how to install an esim into an iphone
given that brits love their slop and gruel, i can see why they didn't like the cornbread, it's generally pretty dry ngl
8:03 gotta add the extra brisket fat fallen to the plate with the cornbread
I wanna see them eat a seafood boil like crab shrimp crawfish
Not thing like Texas ribs I miss Houston tx😢
I'm from Texas. This is why we're fat...
it makes me sad that they never had ribs before....
Should have given them some unsweetened iced tea too.. Half of Texas doesn't drink that sweetened nastiness.   But so much fun to watch them enjoy it all..
"My eyes are watering"...So good it made him 😢!!! 🤣🤣🤣
They’re trying REAL food for the first time 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Anybody else watching at 1:27am hungry asf now 🥹
Harry is the cutest!!
13:42 Tell that boy simmer down, them fighting words
that cornbread needs a big slather of butter and then it won't seem dry compared to the meat.
that cornbread needed some honey butter
Happily watching this from Texas! Enjoy boys❤❤❤
We need them to try all USA BBQ styles now.
Haha.. British backed Beans on toast .. Their ultimate British delicacy. So sophisticated lol
😅Beans..and pit!  These are so fun to watch.
These kids appear to be intellectual superior to our high school youth.  lol
Love cornbread especially freshly made warn… it tastes lovely😊
Yall need to bring these kids and head master to America and let them try more of the food here
NOOOO coleslaw on the BBQ in Texas! That's an eastern thing in the Carolinas- Virginia!
i know they get excited when these vids happen
I love seeing this new generation of students trying food...kinda miss the other dudes
lol loves these kid’s expressions
So paper in Britain tastes like Texas Cornbread... Awesome!
Watching English folk eat american food always makes me feel grateful to live here.. i have texas BBQ once a week and  biscuits and gravy bout once a week
I've watched so many of these where the kids say, "that's just nice," which I've come to understand is pretty high praise. To hear them say, "oh, my God," right from the start says it all.
Next time you should get the best bbq in the us (Kansas City)
Was the cornbread not sweet or something??
Sent this to my kids who grew up eating Texas BBQ lol.   They don’t even know how good they got it lol
Why aren’t any Brit’s starting restaurants like these?  Just asking…
Put some respect on americas name especially black folks.  Happy Juneteenth!❤❤❤
This CONFIRMS My Decision, IM NEVER GOING TO THE UK! This Food is Basic, and THEY NEVER HAD FLAVORFUL FOOD LIKE THIS. Where would I eat if I visited the UK, ijs
Cornbread is delicious if it’s made right.
Thomas Jefferson loved Macoroni and Cheese.
Cornbread was created by my Native American brothers and sisters long before European colonization. It actually helped keep the colonists alive. To me its not a required taste. I can understand why most of the folks on here would have a hard time with it though. Great job guys. Love the video.
U.K.: You're eating thr cornbread wrong. Eat it warm with melted butter and honey on it. The cornbread needs to be made with butter and not some oil[ i.e vegetable oil].
Louisiana/Texas (lived in both) I love watching people try our food, Southern BBQ & Cajun food are some of America's best foods
Give them cornbread with soup or collards greens or something it goes with
I just want a shot of everyone struggling to stay awake from the food coma
this video is great, but I really think  think they should go back to doing more higher ages and a lot less middle ages because they are a lot less immature and can't accept that people like certain foods they don't like.
that was some legit brisket
One of them looks like brad pitt...
The one kid is not British he is an invasive cancer
I have such a crush on the Head Master!!
I enjoy your videos ! 😁
영국남자 채널인 줄 알았는데😢
They got so excited over the pickles! 😂😂
The flavor just lasts for ages...
These kids are a credit to the UK. Charming, polite, enthusiastic and funny! The headmaster is a legend. Props to the school and the parents. Oh. And I suppose we have to hand it to the USA. They know their way around a bbq. 😂
Watching these really makes me want them to try northern cornbread! Sweeter, denser, whole corn!! So much better than the desert dry cornbread imo
"It's like steak, times 1,000!" I can't love that quote more!
Finally!!!!   I have missed the kids and the headmaster so much!!   You need way more of these videos.
You're supposed to butter the cornbread! Outrageous! 😂❤
These young men are always so polite but so hilarious!
You dont rawdog cornbread. You have to put butter and honey on it.
Thatll be your whole life savings please.
My hubby makes corn bread with the butter melted in it and then puts honey on top as it’s finishing being cooked in the oven. His corn bread is so moist and delicious!
I'm Texan.  I've never heard of a Texas fold.  It would be sacrilegious to do that to brisket. And we don't eat cornbread with BBQ.
Texan here. Yeah I knew they would all love the meat…. BUT YOU DIDNT EVEN USE SAUCE!!!!!!
😅Next time try eating brisket in a homemade tortilla. And we dont really put our beans on bread... Put butter on cornbread.
I prefer creamy Mac and Cheese, I don't like the crispy type. Put butter on the cornbread.
See, you understand where the obesity problems are coming from now, right? Imagine having _this_ right down the street!   It's hard out here.
That brisket looks dry
Lil kids so proper lmaoo
Proof that Texas BBQ is the best food in the world
The head master seems like a really nice man . I can see why the students respect him .
I need an episode on how you bring all this food back to the UK 😂
No butter and honey on the cornbread?!
Cornbread must be slightly sweet with lots of melted butter on it
Portugal?!?🙄Come to America!!!
2:42 lmaooo he gets it. 😂
I think there’s a Texas bbq market in Europe
that headmaster needs to visit the US with y’all
Hey - Can you guys start a new series???  "30 year old guy from the Pacific Northwest tries ______"  I swear I will give you great reactions and I will probably love everything. It's a winning concept, I promise.
How do they get the food there??
this one is hilarious
Proper British table manners just flew out the window.
I know you dont season anything and as a Californian i THOUGHT i had perfect meat here.... then i went to the south of America.... my golly never in my life have i had a bite like that. Watching these kids makes my heart happy lol
Really need to do a whole hog BBQ for them
12:53 loving this guy here, dude knows what he likes and he is DIGGING in never let an opportunity pass you by homie I love the attitude and the lowkey enthusiasm behind everything he experiences. Don't know how to describe it but he's shameless but with class, you know??... like he's shameless because he has nothing to be ashamed of and he knows it.
tbh, those pork ribs didn't look as moist as they could've been, but i could be wrong
I feel sorry for britz and their 💩 tasting food. They actually think they have the best food 😂
I end up watching these kids, but the teacher or instructor or whatever you call them, he he just he used to talk this kills me
He said he loves beans.  Id sponsor him on a Texas visit. looks like he appreciated the beans and the beef ribs even though he kept forgetting what it was callex 😅
Please go with southern mac n cheese if you're gonna give them some. Bread crumbs???? That should be illegal.
Very sweet.  Olllie and Josh gave these little boys core memories that will be with them till adulthood driving their desire to go to America and eat real Texas BBQ.  It's very sweet.
I love watching them eat and seeing them enjoy things for the very first time it’s humbling and exciting and adorable all the things
The coolest Principal I wish I had.
You need to have Lewis Hamilton go to Franklin BBQ when F1 is at COTA.
Came a long way from trying to eat ribs with a fork and knife.
That boy looks like the little baseball player boy from the movie Meet The Robinsons
As an American  I can honestly  say the best BBQ I ever had was in Texas..Ibstill have dreams about that BBQ it was so good, also the corn bread should be eaten with beans❤
headmaster's life has changed
That was hilarious!  I feel bad for these kids not growing up with our food.  I wonder if they got the meat sweats????
That reaction to cornbread is why the Revolution had to happen, lol.
Future Texans
As a Year 9 Literature teacher, I love this! This group of young men are not shy about expressing their opinions and I'm here for it!!!
Sweet cornbread!  Add condensed milk !! And butter mixed with bacon fat.   Moist cornbread: Just half and half and bacon grease instead of milk
I have no real basis for this, but I always feel worse for the little black British kids 😂 what are their parents cooking and how are they ding it?
Grade 7 highschool????     - from canada so if a 24/7 tea drinker who sounds like harry Potter could explain that would be " lovely". 😅😅😅
Its texas bbq but you can cook it anywhere. Im currently in California and yeah, i home cook everything from Mexico to india, and then i need some korean/ japanese sauces for basically the rest of the world lol
Ugh I know I’m old. There’s like a genetic thing in us that makes us middle aged folks enjoy watching kids enjoy a meal.  The older I get the more it warms my heart. It has to go back to prehistoric times.
The comment section has spoken! The headmaster goes to texas
Now they know why we Americans are fat af. 😂😂😂 especially here in Texas.
NEWBIE HERE:  How do they get Texas BBQ all the way to Britain while still retaining its "freshness"? I'm genuinely curious!
As a born and raised Texan it makes me so happy how much they enjoy it.  As for the cornbread, whoever made it didn’t do it right for those reactions 😂.  Needs to be made with sugar to offset the savory as well as some butter.
honey cornbread would probably change his mind lol
this is so wholesome to see I smiled so hard the whole video 🩵
Zadok The Priest had me dying 😂
They are inhaling that food. 😂😂😂😂😂
with this episode, no way i ain't subscribing lmao
I like sweet cornbread, and my mother in the north makes sweet cornbread, and in the south cornbread isn't sweet and it tastes bland to me.
Behold the poor Brits raised on British 'cuisine' encountering real food 🤣🤣
7th grade aint highschool boss😂
Everyone was excited😂❤
The amount of evangelism y'all have done for Texas food is making me tear up rn 😭 The amount of love I have for other cultures' food and knowing that because of people like y'all the food of my home will be remembered and loved the same way by others gives me so much joy. Thanks for everything y'all do 🥹
As an Okie, I would've loved to have seen them try collard greens and fried okra!
Gotta bring these young men over to the Lone Star here for a BBQ tour.😊😊 glad y'all enjoyed the que!
Them boys needed a pitcher of ice cold Sweet tea
Once a year I smoke a Brisket, pork butt, jalapeño sausages and bacon.  I put it all on a brioche bun with homemade slaw, pickles and BBQ.  I call them Meat Sweats.
As a Texan, I absolutely love seeing people try BBQ for the first time. Im jealous that I can’t try it for the first time again.
Should have given them sweet honey corn bread.
Please give is a update on how Max& his mates are doing Fellas I adore Max
One year me and my class were going to the texas state fair. At the time my love for texas bbq was at it peak, thus to make the day a success I need some good old brisket. It took a while and my teacher had to pay for it but I got it. then when I got home it was food poisoning and I was measurable and my grandma is old fashioned so I went to school the next day. the brisket was worth it though
Few people can eat like a teenage boy!  I'd love to have a tray of food like that.
Love the adjectives these kids use. Perfect.
should have given them butter for the cornbread.  and if that didn't work, add some honey.  that is southern desert.
"Everything is better with bread isn't it?" Right you are Ken!
Southern cornbread needs butter (cream) and honey!!   Come on guys!!
8:43 pause
I haven't had some good BBQ in awhile. This is making me drool
I am a Texan that does not like sweet tea. It tastes like sugar water. If I wanted sugar water, I'd drink sugar and water. I want to taste the tea, strong enough to cut the teeth- hot or cold.
Now everyone will understand why America is obese. They've tasted it!!
Lol...I ate my way through out the West Pacific Asia.....(pre Charmin times Lol) only caught Dysentery once...and would risk it again.....watch out  where the Shrimp are caught....(they are not picky eaters)
They needed some banana pudding for dessert.
No Vegans were harmed in the making of this video
I don't think I've ever seen BBQ beans put on bread before.
How do you get this food to the kids there?
I love these kids! I keep thinking poor babies but they’re not. But still… I’m the eternal grandma.♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
These make me feel like I could make decent living just making onion burgers and rings over there.
I'm from the south i love cornbread but I'll keep it to myself
need some milk and some butter with that cornbread
Try Puerto Rican food!
That boy with the expressions is an animated character. Is just perfect with every single expression and having transcendental experiences while he's eating test barbecue😂😂😂
Corn bread with honey butter…yummy
Beige contradiction
Texan here. I never feel more patriotic than when I watch foreigners enjoy our greatest export. Tears in my eyes. I’ll be playing this video on loop this Fourth of July.
The cornbread needs honey butter.
“cultural diffusion”
Lets be honest here....not all cornbread is equal. It also needs butter and a touch of honey if you like.
these poor fog breathers getting a taste of freedom T_T   you love to see it  headmaster seemed chuffed
Why did y'all buy such huge portions
A Like right away
What did you fellows do to the cornbread ? Cornbread is always one of the favorites at cookouts.
I really enjoyed this video. I'm glad you kiddos got to sample some Texas BBQ. Much love from South Texas ❤
You should have them do Hispanic foods next
Corn bread is better with honey and butter
You should have had butter and honey for the cornbread!❤
You need to bring the head master with you on trips
Okay.. when I heard beans on toast I said okay.. because its TOAST, i didn’t know yall was out here putting beans on untoasted bread as well!
It isn't a horrible analogy lol. I should watch the entire video before I respond. We alwaye in my family use cornbread to mop up the juices. That young lad gets it lol. Bring him with you when he is of age 😂❤ he will have a grand time in Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas.
I wonder how and where the food on this show is prepared. Surely not cooked, shipped and reheated?
Cornbread is too spicy for these youngsters!
“I’ve had the bread” lol.
Well I definitely won't be going to the UK for food if this is how they react every time to what americans call everyday food.
why are they so fancy?
They all gained 20 pounds in this sitting
“They make beef sausages!?” 😂
It makes my southern heart so flippin happy to watch them mmmmmm their way through my absolute favorite foods. Man I just had homemade spaghetti, but I want some burnt ends and a TX fold. ❤❤❤❤ Bread does 100% make everything better. 😂🎉
That cornbread was too soft... best if the edges are crispy and the whole is chewy...
They must come to the states and experience it in person. They lose their minds just trying everything especially in ny
You literally ruined food for them smh, they were so content with their beans on toast and fish and chips before this. Now they will never be satisfied with English food ever again
My favorite thing to hear is “oh ny days!” I find that so hilariously adorable and funny british slang
these kids are developing american tastebuds.
Cornbread CANNOT be eaten unless it’s served warm, with heaps of butter and honey, or honey butter! And pork ribs will always be superior to beef ribs.
Never seen a Headmaster have a Orgasm in front of his students.🧐
"and you can even put a little bit of sloor in there!" -my gosh. maybe one day you'll even pronounce Raaaaanch right
Nice Mammoth Sweatshirt!
I so agree with @DellaChambers,  Lots of melted butter on the cornbread.  Also, tell the boys I have a sweet cornbread recipe that might change their minds.  LOL
Lived in Houston for 6 and a half years.  I love Texas to be honest.  Moving back.    But I'm a Kansan first.  Don't forget about KC Bar-B-Q.
You know it’s good when British people eat with their hands🤣😂👍.
8:12 You need to add honey to the cornbread.
Get these guys Cooper sharp and onuons cheesesteak from Angelo's in Philadelphia..blow you away just as much.
Anything is better than the bland crap for food they have over there.
This is great, these are some of your best episodes. Especially when you do these and follow the same group through their school year's. 👍🇺🇸
fly em to austin
Very enjoyable video, I liked every bit of it.👍👍
Please let these kids try Cajun food and foods from Louisiana next, stuff like pralines, beignets, jambalaya, gumbo, and more!
This is one of my favorite episodes!! 😂😅 British beans aren't very tasty!! The teens are funny and great!!
I love the way the British speak. "It's lovely"
3:42 They should try ftied pickles. A popular southern side dish.
I’m so glad they got to try this! American BBQ is so amazing!
THIS IS WHAT OUR CULTURAL EXPORT SHOULD BE!!!!! Why export "democracy" in 3rd world countries when we could export cheesy grits, smoked sausage, baby back ribs, baked beans and chili abroad?
Time for them to learn about the meat sweats. 😂
For Americans eating is a full contact sport.
Cornbread needs butter. Also sweet  cornbread is the best. Mexican cornbread. Was the cornbread cooked in a cast iron skillet?
These chaps don't know how to eat a sandwich 😢
Jolly over there turning British school boys into Texans in one meal.  Y'all are welcome over here anytime.
Always wash it down with sweet tea.
For me cornbread needs a big slab of butter, hush puppies too
Hey Brits, now you know Merica!  250 years of US gets you the best!  Sorry,  not Sorry.
8:15 you got to butter your cornbread though
I’m so sorry they’ve never experienced this, and they probably will never experience it again.
Abd now they have learned a new American phase....Meat Coma. Lol
The bloody Brits don't like cheese? Must be why they lost.
No no no. Must serve cornbread with butter makes big difference.
Lived in Texas my whole life and never heard of a Texas fold
From the USA here.  There are so many good BBQ styles and Texas like that is great.  Some use dry seasoning rubs and others use tomato-based sauces or vinegars with flavors that range from spicy, savory and/or sweet. Is there anything similar done in England with smoked meats?
It's like they've never had food before! 😂
That looks lovely lolol
Living in Texas, I've almost never felt more validated than after hearing their distaste for cornbread. It's so overwhelmingly prevalent here whenever a nice sourdough is always gonna be 10x better 😭
Brits try food for the first time
So glad you gave those wee lads some real food.
How can someone not like cornbread 😭 that hurt my heart to hear
Those kids are starved for real meat and food flavor! Send them to the U.S.A. South immediately! (Says the southern Mom)! 😅
The hosts are so incredibly fake.  Not EVERY word out of the boys' mouths are worth obnoxious and hysterical laughter.
Why would you put perfectly good brisket with coleslaw on it. Why!!!!
That whole video was delightful from start to finish
You gotta SLATHER the cornbread in butter
Send the headmaster to Memphis for some real pulled pork BBQ! 😊
Very happy never to make cornbread again. Love all of this, 100%, wonderful.
Was the cornbread not honey cornbread? There's your problem!
If someone opened a Texas BBQ spot in London, they would probably make a killing! 🤑
I see why people judging that cornbread lol. So it a bit dry n crumbly. You can skip the butter and honey and throw it in a glass and pour buttermilk on it and go to town with a spoon too lol (I mean I'd go butter first myself) but also tasty.
They are having a food coma
Pete Davidson seemed to like everything
Was it that there was nothing else to do in texas except prepare food that makes the bbq the best?
I can tell just by the look of the corn bread it wasn’t smothered with honey and butter
I love watching British people try Texas BBQ for the first time.
Yum! But you need to add butter and honey to the cornbread 😉
Officially their best day at school ever. Headmaster thinks so too Edit to say these are growing boys they’re clearly starving  for proper food 😂
I love it!
Sweet cornbread with some butter, see what happens.
They got the meat sweats😂
Not a lick of sauce dipped, spiciest thing on the meat probably black pepper….  Multiple British people: “My eyes are litrally WA’ERING right now 🥵”
I just love the headmaster. He always enjoys everything with so much gusto.
I know what I'm picking up at the grocery store tomorrow.
Burnt ends are Kansas City BBQ
That headmaster was killing me! If my principal was like that, school would have rocked
The best part is burping 6 hours later. They'll get a second round of the flavors. Now that you ate all that, Ask why Americans are so big. Corn bread needs a big dollup of butter to make it slide better.
Cornbread and no butter? 😢😢😢😢😢😢 Maybe next time.
You need to at least add a big splash of butter on warm cornbread. Mmmmm, warm buttery cornbread!
It's interesting watching British people discovering that food can actually have flavor.
11:58 instant beans on toast (bread) such a british thing to do! lmao
Okay you're going about the cornbread all wrong..... You need to put butter and honey on warm cornbread!
They would’ve liked the cornbread with butter
My Air Force father learned to smoke a brisket while stationed in Ft. Worth, Texas. It became the star of his annual 4th of July party.
I GOT DA MEAT SWEATS!!!!!
People like to dunk on Americans, but they can’t deny that the food slaps
Now I'm homesick...
A true Texan here, I would starve to death in the UK
They are experiencing their 1st food coma!!!
You got to have honey and butter with the corn bread
Crazy, I'm from smack dab in the middle of texas bbq country and ive never heard of the texas fold. We definitely do it but i didnt know it had a name 😅
😣 pickles in milkshake
Foreigners: OMG TEXAS BBQ  Texan: its food lol
You guys should try that steak with rice. Yes, I'm Asian.
We will keep our cornbread thank you 😊
You need to take a group of British high school students to the U.S., like you did on Korean Englishman with bringing the students to Korea. Take them to a state fair, a theme park that only exists here (i.e. Medieval Times, Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags), or come here around Halloween to see how it's celebrated.
"my mouth is mesmerised" 🤣🤣🤣
You have to put something on the cornbread.  Butter, molasses, sorghum, honey, sauce, beans, whatever.  It’s not usually eaten dry……..and they needed some banana pudding with nilla wafers (vanilla biscuits) to top the meal off.
The smallest student the one who looks like Colin Creavly. I swear he'll go to Texas and probably do every Bar-B-Que Restaurant challenge he can find.
I adore the headmaster in all of these ❤  He deserves his own show, roadtripping the US.
Texan here!  Love this!  Cornbread with butter.  Bring the Headmaster to Ft. Worth for Goldies BBQ!
@12:53 sent me. " have you not eaten in a week?" Sincerely, a concerned friend!
Cornbread is merely a vessel for butter.
Texans can’t make cornbread.
You forgot the American sleeper agent of BBQ. The smoked turkey. The unsung hero that no one expects.
American BBQ overall is in my top 3 cuisine of all time. Any region.
OK, I would never eat cornbread plain like that— I always eat my cornbread with a nice, good quality butter and usually drizzled with honey
I think the Jolly boys screwed up this time. They should have served the sides first BEFORE the meats.  The reactions would have been much different (especially to corn bread). It’s impossible to judge beans and corn bread after brisket and ribs.
Why are they surprised with the beef sausage? What are their sausages made of?
They  are going in BBQ COMA 😂😂😂
Now yall know why we are so fat here 😂😂😂😂
That mac & cheese was criminal😂☠️
You didn't put any butter on the cornbread for them!!!
I understand the dislike for cornbread. I’ve lived in Texas for almost 20 years and I’ve never liked it no matter how many times I’ve tried it
Are they in Britain? How did they get Texas BBQ there & still taste good?
Cornbread is best with butter and eaten with the beans often sold at bbq restaurants.
I think the headmasters wants to be alone with that Texas foldem
This was great!
Pickles ruin everything
POV: You finally use the spices that you conquered half the world for 7:11
Oh, they are sooo  precious 😅
Couldn't agree with the headmaster more at 4:21
Pleaseeee answer. How do y’all get legit Texas BBQ to the kids in England? Do you fly over a chef? It looks great! I just don’t understand how they can try all these foods hot and fresh when so far away lol
Showing food to these kids is a constant reinforcement of what I learned living in england as an american kid hanging out with my friends there... the British are very hesitant to flavor and dont like anything they know as theirs that's more flavorful and better. Youre doing good work exposing these kids to culinary experiences they might not ever get
Need to heat that corn bread up and put butter and honey on it.
Eating it fresh is the best way to have them try it 😋!! Is it fresh?
God I love these kids so much
Next feed the Americans Ham-Biscuit Brickle-Brackle & Beans with Fizzy-Wiggets.” Poshly indignant Sniffle-Snaffle.
PROTECT TEXAS, AT ALL COSTS
I’m glad they enjoyed the meal, but I was surprised when many of them did not like the macaroni and cheese and the beans
3:50 how is that possible?
This isn't Tea, it tastes like juice! 😂🤣 Southern Tea for you.
Headmaster is going to get hit by the water pistol 🔫 gang and wonder if he should go to Texas next year.
"Are you lying?"  Proceeds to gobble/shove the whole slice into his mouth.
Once the Dino ribs came out they all dropped the forks 😂😂
These kids are brilliant
petition to get mac and cheese without bread crumbs
As an American, we know we're morbidly obese. Truly. But when you eat our food, you can understand why, right?
I live in America and never have had this kind of BBQ platter presented to me! I bet it was all delicious! I must go get BBQ tomorrow!
Need some syrup with that cornbread and a better recipe. Come to texas, we'll show ya'll the right way to make cornbread
From Texas with love.
If you make cornbread and add sour cream into the batter and some sugar, it gets fluffier, sweeter.  Closer to a piece of cake than a bread.   Sometimes people even add honey into the batter.  Lots of butter over the top.   THe skin on the sausage is supposed to "snap" when you bite into it.   I'm lucky enough to live in Texas so I can get this whenever I like!
Headmaster is the best every time he takes a bite It’s like he’s having a religious experience 😂😂😂 he needs his own show 🤣
Watching this is an absolute rollicking delight! But I still think that these guys oughta try Kansas City BBQ. My preference.
Corn bread didn’t look right. Looked like you just used the jiff box. Mac looked bad, sides didn’t look normal
Cornbread needs honey or butter. Never just plain
Now you know why we don't so much run to fat in the USA as gleefully gambol towards it. You need deep fried corn on the cob with that, too. this is a celebration of why we're top of the food chain.  Also, American southerners are divided on the matter of conrbread. I suspect you had the classic dry, non-sweet version. I vastly prefer a less dry bake that is slightly sweet. All styles are legit,  though. There are many styles of BBQ throughout the South, each with their own delectable qualities. It's a delight to see folks from elsewhere discover our culinary treats. :)  FWIW, best donuts in the world are filled with fresh cream from a British baker. My all time favorite pastry is a beef curry pasty, also from British bakeries. You have some amazing food, too.  :)
This was fun to watch. Something we take for granted in the US.
Dam now im going to have to get some BBQ.
Their happiness makes me happy!
It’s 2025. They weren’t cooking like this in 1800? I’m so confused. People have been smoking meats for centuries. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Only suggestion I personally have? Brew that tea black as pitch and add as much sugar as you think you need… then like a third more. The tea in this video looked pretty weak which is probably why it wasn’t as good as it could be - like the stuff they try to pass off in NYC as “sweet tea” that tastes like dishwater. We also have something called an Arnold Palmer which is half sweet tea half lemonade - which is just water, lemon juice and sugar, not sprite.
Whipped Honey Butter on that cornbread and they'll be lovinhh it.
Sending love from Texas! Now I need some bbq too! 😂
Makes me proud to be a Texan :) as this is my favorite to eat! As well as smoked ribeye!
unironically eating bbq while clicking on this video
I vote to continue making Born Bread! I absolutely love it! I grew up eating it
Next trial: Kansas City BBQ Boss level: Carolina BBQ
That headmaster is so glad he agreed to have JOLLY in the school to do this.
Pickles: Like cucumber, but better 😂
What makes me mad. Isn't the fact they get to try it and enjoy it. But they only get to more than likely only get to try it this one time. Hopefully they have the want to visit and get themselves everything they liked from here here lol.
these kids bout to knock the fck out in the middle of their next class ahaha
At 13:53, a wise man once told me, "What does being hungry have to do with eating?"
The "still comprehending the flavors" at the end gets me XD. That's what seasoning does.
Harry…”that’s lovely!” Repeatedly…we completely understand!! ❤️
We need a follow up video where they all experience the meat sweats after gorging on all that BBQ.
This episode just makes me so happy watching them enjoy! Brisket is my ultimate favorite smoked meat; to me, nothing beats it.
"Mexican" cornbread is sooooooooooooooooo much better. Baked with cream of corn, finely chopped onions, and jalapenos mixed in . I also add green chilli peppers. It's moist and so very delicious! Much better than plain cornbread.
I don't know about that cornbread, that looks like some box of Jiffy mess.
They should have put some butter with that cornbread. Would have made it taste so much better
As a Texan, I'm smiling ear to ear
This channel is great. These videos are great. Watching their eyes pop out of their heads is hilarious
Cornbread needs butter and honey
And keep eating you will be obese North American style cooking which are quite sure Great Britain is also tune obese country like the USA
Kids these days.
Test American style cooking on high school girls from Great Britain
And they wonder why Americans are bigger..everything they ate was the best they ever had LOL
Mr. Smith, you and your young men  are extraordinarily amazing!!!
This Texan has had plenty of brisket but I’ve never once heard the phrase “the Texas fold” or seen it until this video. It resembles a brisket sandwich, but that’s different. It  needs a bun and onions.
I really really needed some joy today, so thank you Jolly!   Feeling the joy emanating from Josh, Olly and the crew, as they shared the blessings of a Texas BBQ, is the best part of this video for me.  Their giddy reaction to the positive feedback from the kids and headmaster, cheered me up after a very bad day. And "I'm still comprehending the flavors" as the last statement?  Perfect editing choice, well done. Thank you <3
So do you cook onsite in the UK? if so how do you get the spices and the smoke supplies in the UK? Thanks
They need to try sweet cornbread made with cream corn and corn meal, my grandma's recipe baked in a 12 inch cast iron skillet then you pull it from the oven and rub it down with butter
All that grease, they are going to blow up some toilets
Cornbread is to dry lol. It needs to come out of the oven and immediately be split in half and buttered. Maybe some honey.
I love how those refined boys become instant savages when eating the BBQ, just like the rest of us!
“Oh i love beans” is the most adorably British thing ever
Next time let them try Eastern North Carolina BBQ..  My opinion, better than any other BBQ in the country
Those boys wanting their mac n cheese more bland is super sad, smh!!
You finna make these people take obesity back home 😂
The amount they were eating, I hope they had some where to lie down. Some of them definitely caught the itis. At the least they got the meat sweats.
The demographics of this here classroom sure are diverse! Boy, I sure do love the deracination occurring here! It just warms my little Hebrew heart!
I'm Texan and I always serve green chile beans to go with the cornbread.
Now tell them that each southern state has their own versions of all of that.   It's sad you didn't finish it off with banana pudding and/or peach cobbler with homemade ice cream.
😂
The headmaster with the only mature pallet understandably.
Your all welcome to come to Texas. Some of the Brisket and BBQ you find at ma and pa shops is the best
Cornbread without butter is a sin.
Why is brad pitt being highschooler again?
joshua weissman being a fake texan convincing two brit’s a made up term such as a texas fold is the reason bbq plates come with bread and them taking it back to their home country and telling people is hilarious
Cornbread needs that butter and honey. Its heavenly
Now you know why so many of us are fat.
It's smoked, beef butter heaven.  Texas 🇺🇸
But Americans don’t have culture they say
Hogwarts is wild nowadays
Sweet corn bread with honey, my favorite dessert.
Thst cornbread didn't look right. I felt bad for the cornbread.
God bless you lads 🙏🏻🇺🇸
"Here come the Meat Sweats."
This Chicago girl will always give Texas props for knowing how the hell to do BBQ and brisket.
They're all such fine young fellows! It's a shame they can't experience it all with a stiff margarita as God intended.
They need to add a bunch of butter with the cornbread ❤
These videos give me perma-grin! I just sit here chewing the whole time. LOL BTW, that was the most grim looking iced tea I’ve ever seen. It was so light I thought it was cider, no wonder they all said “That’s not tea”. 😂❤
What you failed to do with the mac and cheese is to shred the brisket and put it on top
Ok as an American (in one of the 4 big bbq areas) i absolutely loved this. I can understand their first taste of cornbread but it does grow on you, but cornbread is amazing if you also put honey on it.   I can COMPLETELY agree with them that the hard top macaroni and cheese is not that great. I prefer the runny, cheesy style of mac and cheese.
BBQ is the only time when manners doesn't exist when eating 😂😂😂😂😂
Cute video,
dear god it makes my heart sad knowing this is the most flavor these brits have ever had in their lives
They get some flavor in their life
Where is the sauce? Every BBQ is better with a good sauce.
oh to be a british high schooler
What do you expect from british. Have you taste their food? Of course they are going to like this US food.
We put love into our Texas recipes 😍🩷
They should have bread and butter chips…aka sweet pickles, instead of regular pickles.  Sweet pickles make the sandwich/fold taste so much better.
Sad thing is they'll go back to beans on toast and say it's the best thing ever
That Headmaster is rethinking his whole existence, lol
The kids are alright
And they all got the meat sweats 😂
13:41  I’m not a fan of southern corn bread either. But northern corn bread is an entire different food. It’s sweetened and it’s moist. (Think banana bread, texture and sweetness). And I know I just started a huge argument with that statement. 😂😂😂
I LOVE THAT THEYRE EATING W THEIR HANDS
Wonder if they’d like Mexican cornbread or northern cornbread with more sugar in it
I love watching these boys enjoying the worlds best bbq so much! ❤ Lovely boys.
Have they had sweet cornbread?
This warms my cold heart
As a texan, My favorite genre on youtube is british people eating texas bbq
Love your videos on our food in the USA..😊   But.    You never have school girls trying food. wHY?????😊😊😊😊
Pro Tip - Cornbread needs to be eaten Hot or warm with Freshly Melted butter
This was cute! 😂
that cornbread was suppose to be covered in butter thats why they didnt like it
Killers or Roger’s are not the best…you’re obviously not from Texas:  it’s Franklin, any of the Black family’s places, Snows, and Saltlick—the one out side Austin in driftwood…where’s the potato salad??? Also we don’t put slaw on a bun …that’s the Carolina’s and they put in on pulled pork as a sandwich
You needed to put butter and honey on the cornbread!
I’d like to see them try good old fashion Puerto Rican food
looks so good
Aa an American I enjoyed their Texas BBQ Discovery happiness
KC barbeque beats Texas. Don't forget St.  Louis Ribs, Memphis and Carolina pulled pork.
I always enjoy these kids enthusiasm.
😂😂❤
Okay, WHO messed up on the cornbread????? They need a do-over on that!!!  But I know that had a GOOD nap after this!!!
You all bring joy to my heart
I feel grateful having texas bbq down the street :)
This just in, thousands of brits are moving to texas….
I grew up in Texas and I’ve never heard the term “Texas Fold.”  It’s just a brisket sandwich.
Corn bread needs loads of butter.
Making me hungry
Cornbread, at least give them honey on it to eat, they'll love it, butter too, but just plain, they won't like it, but I'll bet they'd like HushPuppies....
It's not a good time to visit the u.s. right now.
Love the kids that tried what they don’t like. The kid with the pickles, the kid with the beans. I love that, shows how well they are being raised.   Also, I’m not a fan of standard cornbread either, however, sweet cornbread I love
Please take headmaster to America!!! Even better if you take the boys you took to Korea, especially Max and Armand!!
"Have you not eaten in a week?"   🤣
Where’s Mohammad? I thought these were British Highschoolers
This video made me hungry
I've lived in Texas for 28 years, and I lived in Kansas City before that. BBQ is pretty much my love language. But I've never once heard of a "Texas Fold" That's new to me.
Welcome to the delicious side!  Texas BBQ is a blessing on us all.    Butter the hell out of that cornbread and it'll be so much better!
Put a bit of slarr if you want 😂
Lol!! I love when you do these videos with the kids!!!
Welcome to the revolution bros, this is what we fought for; but we're friends now so... BBQ!
I don't know what kind of cornbread that was but sweet cornbread is the best... Cornbread without sugar is really hard to eat.
13:57 I want this kid to get honorary US citizenship. He gets it. 🍗❤😊
These are my favorite episodes !
I want you to see you take these kids to America on a food tour.
If your cornbread is dry, then it isn't Southern cornbread.
As an American grandma, it did my heart good to watch all those young boys eat loads of food and enjoy every bite!
I love watching British people taste food with actual flavor. Now y'all know why Americans take such massive bites XD
Yall don’t have international phone plans? I pay like 10 a month extra and it’s normal.
As much as I like cornbread, it is better with a pot of beans or greens than with BBQ.  I never understood serving it with meat.  White bread does better absorbing the meat juices, while cornbread does better with the juices of beans or greens.  Also, there is sweet cornbread and savory cornbread.  Sweet cornbread may as well be cake and served afterward.
The Headmaster is my favorite in all these videos. I don’t think he’s met a food he didn’t like. He needs his own sponsored trip to the US to go on a food tour.
Johnny 🎂 🚫🌽🍞
I'm from Waco 🤠.  We have scads of bbq and more Texas top vendors in less than a 2 hr drive from here.  Come see me!  I can sell you a house, too 😂  These guys are such good sports!  Wait until you try our Mexican food 🌮🌶🎉
I love the Mammoth mountain long sleeve t-shirt
If you kids keep eating like Americans then you can look like Americans too. Fat!!
That's not the real South cornbread
you need to take the headmaster to franklins down in Austin, TX
:)
This is why we are fat lol.🤣 usa,
The reason you don't like the cornbread is because you're eating it wrong. You have to have butter and honey.
Smoked bbq is so good that vegans flagellate themselves because of their natural human instinct to desire this food.
I like butter & honey on my cornbread.  😊
THE BARK?? BHAHAH loveee the bark
As a Texan i really wish they all tried the corn bread with a bit of butter and honey
Restaurant cornbread is not the best. You need homemade hot water cornbread for that.
Without a doubt, the US is the best place to eat because there is excellent food from all around the world.
new title: British Highschoolers realize why Americans are fat
Kids are brutally honest😂
Highschool? They look like tne year olds.
'I don't think I can eat food here anymore', had be literally lol.
This is why Americans are overweight.
Soooo hungry now. ❤
They’re so polite! Geez we suck
Gotta have melted butter and honey on the cornbread. Thank me later
Texas burnt ends are just off cuts.  There is only 1 true Brunt Ends.
I love how both boys perked up immediately at “PICKLES!!!” 😂
Is one of these kids Rory’s little brother?
They look like they're having a sublime religious experience.
half of them will move to texas when they hit 18 lol
Do they bbq over there or bring th food there or they travel here to the us ??
Merica!
Cornbread is more an acquired taste, got to start the kids off with sweet cornbread.
Appreciate this. Beans and cornbread consist in me
I love pork ribs better than beef. Your pork ribs should be cooked till they nearly fall off the bones.
You'll kill those boys with all that flavor!
Having spent a lot of time in the UK and finding the food to be somewhat "uneventful" to my palate....I can understand why these kids and the teacher are so amazed at all the flavor of eating Texas BBQ and the brisket and other sides.  Even in California, we have some great BBQ, but nothing like in Texas.  Damn I'm hungry now!!  Dig, DmGrk
Does anyone else see Jesus’ face in the charcuterie board?
Right On!!! My girl literally just told me I was drooling right now.
I'm from Texas,  and a brisket snob.  I'm so glad you got to try this.   If you come to Texas try Black's BBQ.    But... watching you guys eat this much brisket and beef rib is making me kinda sick.
👋🌻🦋🌹💖 hello from Kentucky y'all 👋
어느나라 사람이든 자기 고향 음식이 외부 사람들에게 환영받았을때 뿌듯한건 마찬가지구나
And in suits with a tie....lol
Texan here. I’m not a huge cornbread fan, but offering those kids cornbread without a stick of butter is cruel
Quite right. Pickles are indeed like cucumbers, only better.
WTF? Does the UK not know about pickles? they put vinegar on fires, how is pickle not on their radar?
I thought they did this one already, but I'm all for people enjoying delicious food.
I’m surprised the headmaster didn’t visit Texas for his vacation.
I'm in MS and we have bbq too,  I prefer pulled pork nachos, but that's about it.. B U T    watching this, I'mma think it's time to try some more BBq and make it the TX - MS Fold!!
Here in the south, this is normal to have on the weekends. Nothing beats brisket, Mac-n-cheese, with a sweet tea.
In my part of Texas, cornbread, beans and sweet tea is a complete meal. Especially during the cooler parts of the year. And, don't forget the onion.
being from texas, i am very thankful that i can get this anytime i want😁
I like these kids because their vocabulary is very good.  On one episode one of the kids said the food was exquisite.
See what happens when you don't boil everything
mack is giving early 2000s brad pitt
that taste is ambrosia.
Is this the last video for this series or what? Y’all make it sound like the last one?
It's funny how at first they look apprehensive but then immediately love it
need some greens to crumble the cornbread into.
Many different types of cornbread and many different ways to eat it. I like mine in a bowl of stew, boiled beans, or cut in half and stuffed with butter.
We love our BBQ :)
Heart attack specials.  Tastes good...but eat this junk for a few years and you'll decline so much physically.
When they said they had a gift for the headmaster, I really hoped it was a trip to Texas, or anywhere in the South.
Yes, brisket done correctly is the best thing on earth
Mayor British is so blind they have no seasoning and no taste I would never eat anything from that country
Now can you UK guys understand why we have a weight issue? 🤣 especially states like Texas
You called it Southern! Thats Mid-west, different. Texas carries the western beef style bbq. South-east is all pig. If I may suggest....Please? Ya'll gotta get to the original Sprayberrys in Newnan, Georgia, U.S. . Ask for the burnt end sandwich, with a side of Brunswick stew then add it to it. Next is lemon ice box pie. ❤❤❤ The history here is deep  as a Louis Grizzard book. "*Chefs kiss*"
OG highschoolers should join the next gen highschoolers, that would be a great video... the headmaster fell asleep in his office lol
Im a fan of warm cornbread with honey
Disposing it's true food in Britain sucks
Ah you ruin pit beans by putting them on bread- and where the honey butter for the corn bread?!
Amazing young gentleman trying new foods amazing ❤️❤️❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Yumy
JOLLY ! OH MY GOODNESS ! Y'ALL ARE HILARIOUS ENTERTAINMENT !!! CONTINUE BRINGING IT !!!
Nothing beats pork ribs, Eastern NC style 🤤🤤🤤
Corn bread is an acquired taste IMO
But would you go to war with IRAN for some Texas BBQ?
Corn bread needs butter!!!
europeans never understand why we are all fat until they try our food
Have them try Nashville hot chicken if they haven’t alr
So is there a Texas BBQ place in England?
Put your cornbread in a glass of cold milk. Sounds horrible, tastes amazing
Next is the food coma that leads into a 2 hour nap
Nothing as American as Texas BarB cue. Have to agree with the kid that said cornbread tastes like paper! Barely edible without honey and butter . Never found anybody who agreed with me. Also not a fan of beans or mac and cheese...love these guys
Zadok the Priest for the KING of BBQ!
Better than beans on toast eh boys?
The cornbread needed butter. A huge slab for each one.
These babies are barbecue wasted! 😭😂😂
Everything is bigger and better in Texas.
Native Texan here, If any of yall end up in Pasadena Texas, stop by Andy’s Hawg Wild Bbq off Dedman St. Best Bbq I’ve ever had in my life 😁❤️👍.
Loves these videos
I so enjoy this kind of content.❤️
And people wonder why America has the most obese people
The headmaster was ready to risk it all!! 😭😂😂😂
Absolutely sublime is a perfect expression for brisket. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 🤤
Texan here I’m rolling laughing hahaha
I want to to see you take the principal and maybe some kids to America
Welcome to Texas!
Hahahahaha ! Better than beans on toast, huh ? Like to see the look on these kids face when they see a 72 oz steak 😂
Do they ship the American food to England or the British kids to America? Or do they cook it in England?
This is making me hungry!
the cornbread hater can stay in UK for life
한국자막이... 이젠 없어
They're about to have the meat sweats 😅😅
10:21 Thats what she said
9:12 Ollie is the expert now, apparently LOL
Cornbread resets the palate. I hope it wasn't the sweet kind. It is supposed to be bland with a rough consistency and a little crunchy on the crust.
Everything is "that's lovely."
In all fairness you should have probably threw some jalapeños and cheddar in that corn bread
This should be called American celebrities have kids in Britain that try American food 1st to time.
It beats blood pudding. doesn't it...
Welcome to Texas my boys best BBQ you will ever eat
The Food in Texas is AMAZING… The political vibes in Texas are sadly AWFUL.
I’m a born and raised Texan and I’ve been smiling this whole video 😭 they truly were missing out on the delicious food us Texans make !
I have never seen anyone eat BBQ in a coat and tie, very impressed they dont have grease and sauce all over them!
yeah with max and cheese it hit or miss the breaded tops im not a fan of breaded top but backed top no bread is good
These boys are all so charming, so well brought up. What a pleasure watching! Thank you 😊
You have to bring Dave to the US!!!!
“That’s lovely “ it’s just the best compliment and the way lil bro saids it lol
Neither of them are funny BTW
There's something wrong with those kids I dont know what it is but it's off putting
I wonder if the other kids at this school are jealous of these guys
I just everytime can't get over how "nice" alll these kids are. I have never heard anyone under 40 use the word "lovely", i guess i hang out with the degenerates.
Put a little butter on that cornbread!! Loads better
Grew some watching this boyz
The introduction : they talk like giving them nasty fast food garbage is a good thing !
Not one of those students went home and had dinner. I’m stuffed just watching.
I love these videos. The kids are extremely exciting to watch. I will tell you one thing though I miss the brothers that were in your videos: one was a priest and the other I think was in the army. Can we get a video with them soon to see how they have been?
Idono if i missed it but you gave them cornbread without honey butter??????????? the shame!!!
Say what you will about Americans & America - but we have some of the most amazing food in the world ❤
The cornbread you gave them wasn't sweet?! 😭💔
Texan, this is probably the best example of Texas BBQ I've seen in a video from another country. I will say though just looking at it, its still miles better here. Good job whoever cooked that though!
I love watching the students reaction.  Harry’s reaction is my favorite!!! Cheers mates!!
Every time I see one of these….i feel so bad for the English, they don’t know what proper food is 😢😢😢
0:55 That child is in high school??
One of those boys looks like Brad Pit.
I’m so glad yall enjoyed the food from my state 😊
Where did you get this from, Josh cook it at home?
There are American BBQ restaurants in England now.
Love this…💛
By the looks, ya'll did justice to Texas barbecue.  There's so many international channels that do not, and even offend - but ya'll did phenomenal.
I grew up with all this. Cornbread never been my thing either 😂
My family loves cornbread, but I can't stand it!
I think you 2 should take a trip to Chicago and try Italian Beef, Chicago style hotdog and tavern style thin crust pizza
"Wet" cornbread is arguably much better. It's not as grainy and very moist.
Do you not have any kind of seasoning because that’s what it seems like. I mean when you cook meat, do you just cook it and throw it out there to eat without putting seasoning on it?
Ok
Cornbread needs a lot of honey-butter on top!
they make beef sausage? silly boy, there's a reason why so many americans are obese! of course we have beef sausage! we've got loads of fatty, sugary, flavored foods!
How do you guys get meat into the UK?  Customs?   We could never bring any of you products back to Texas.  P.S. love the pickles park.
Hey Blokes, we use spoons, forks & knives in the USA!
Love the Coronation Anthem when the brisket comes out!!
The fats the best thing!!!!!!
Sweet cornbread
Black boy can eat Lot!😐 Me Like that .😐
the little one who says lovely and picked up a single bean. you are a star!!!!!
From Georgia U.S.A.   Cornbread DOES suck.  I know it, neighbors, friends and family know it too. Some traditions don't need to be carried forward.  2 ingredients can be stretched to 5 just to make real bread folks.  🍞
These kids are so cute! Love their responses! Bring some of them on a field trip down here to Texas! We'll feed them!
10:30 I do t think I can eat food here anymore..😂😅
I would love to see a behind the scenes video of this series to see how you guys get the food to England/ the kids.
Just LOVE watching these students, the are enjoying their new food & Master Smith is the best and such a good sport.
Hey we cook some good bbq in new jersey too we impart a bit from each region into our own lil thing
Absolutely hilarious that the first instinct of all of them is to put the beans on bread hahaha
To all my British folks, put honey in the cornbread batter
Honey is needed with cornbread
1:17 bet you dont miss "mackies" after this lol
My Grandmother from Arizona, used to make "Mexican Cornbread."   Used Creamed Corn, put down a layer and top it with cheddar and jalapenos and repeat and broil a bit to get the top layer of cheese crispy.  That and Cowboy beans!
i loved hearing the kid say he might not be able to eat food in the UK anymore lol
They’ve gotta bring these young men here to America and let them experience it in real time.
The kid who called cornbread flavorless is lucky he didn’t say that around a southern mom 😂
Soooo where did they get this in England?
Cornbread needs to be fresh, warm, and have BUTTER ON IT!
goated vid
9:52 their facial expressions. Pause.
Giving these students unbuttered cornbread was just cruel.
As a Texan, everything here looked righteous….except that Mac and cheese lol. Y’all should have had someone’s Black granny make that and you’d have been golden lol
As an American man, ya love to see it.   And THIS is why I laugh when they say we do not have cuisine and culture.
Principal smith sitting in best spot on jolly vids. He gets everything!
We're was the peach cobbler?
Me so Hungy Hungy!😂
Nice reactions! But "Don't make cornbread ever again"? ... Lots of grandmas gonna slap you for that one 😆
The Americans in here with the ‘more flavour than they have ever tasted’, typing it while hopping down to the doctors that will overcharge them for their type 2 medicine. You guys eat sugar and garlic, your food palette is essentially a sweet shop
They're so funny. I wish they would put their names above them.
Are these the 2 guys I've watched come over to the us and eat BBQ having other people try it? 😜 Great Idea! Have someone from the Us come over and cook it for you! Have a cookout!!! Lol! 🤣
They need cornbread made in a cast iron skillet. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. Lots of butter
You all need to come to Kansas City for bbq!
I love cornbread 😊
Watching brits expire seasoning for the first time in their life will always be something i enjoy watching.  Watching these kids learn there's more than just salt in the world is great.
Cornbread needs sugar and fried on stovetop before finishing off in oven.
Cornbread with melted butter and honey is so good.
Hey guys I love the channel! But is that AI images at the top right for the foods? I understand constraints but AI is kinda..
Cornbread NEEDS salted butter. Its too dry and bland by itself.
I'm from the US (Michigan) and I'm jealous...
You can tell who has the more refined palates.
You need butter on corn bread
The cool thing about Texas BBQ is it’s all technique. The only seasoning used is salt, pepper, and garlic powder. The difference is the wood used and how the pit master runs the pit and treats the meat.
I’ll never understand how bbq isn’t everywhere? I mean just try it
for some good corn bread (im texan) put a lil sprite in it.
Maybe this is why they don’t have as much obesity as we have here.
Who did they fly out to cook all this? Its beautiful
Ribs are my favorite!
I want to make them some KC bbq  so bad!
America Number 1!!!
Wait...... Brits don't have pickles...? Or haven't ever tried them?
loved the kids going after the ribs like sharks in chummed water
Isn’t Brooklyn BBQ better?
As a Texan I approve, where did y'all go for that? There are a lot of BBQ places in Texas I still haven't gone to :)
Once again I've just gotta say as someone who was born and raised in Texas, in all my 38 years I've never heard of the Texas Fold. I'm not saying I haven't done it because I have, probably every single time I've had BBQ, but I have never heard it referred to as the Texas Fold.
You have to put butter on the cornbread 😋🤤🙏❤️
Nah they gotta have my wife’s cornbread, it’ll gain us back their faith in cornbread👌
Should have had butter to go on the corn bread, it would have been a different experience.
I like that headmaster. He was very entertaining in his enthusiasm! I'd love to see their reactions (all of them) to being in the southern US and having all of these things made and served immediately. Just to see the difference, if nothing else.  Just as a note, your subtitles are completely borked at around 7:00. The cornbread conversation was being subtitled nearly a minute (possibly more) before the video showed the cornbread conversation. If you can, it would be awfully nice and helpful to fix that, for those of us who need the subtitles.
For the none cultured savages what is year 7 like 7 years since start of schooling?
1776 will commence again if you keep up the cornbread hate
Don’t give them dry cornbread, butter and honey goes on it!!!!😊
Hello, Humans  Allow yourself to see the many things wrong with the world, and make the choice to change the fail stuff about yourself.  TERRANCE OUT
I am a third generation Texan and I’ve never heard of a Texas fold. I love all the items you put on the white bread but it would have to be on a good, sturdy bun or roll.  Otherwise, yum!
You got to bring the headmaster with you everywhere I enjoy his expressions
The funny thing about British baked beans is they are American lol
Please show us how you get Texas bbq to the uk. It’s crazy how great it looks
NOW I KNOW THEY WERE IN HEAVEN FOR THIS LMAOOOO HOLY WHAT A FIRST TIME FOR SOME TEXAS BBQ
You should have the cornbread with lots of butter- then use it to soak up the meat juices on the plate.
People don’t understand how good American food is till they go… why do you think everyone’s fat 😂
As a Texan you have to get them to try Tex Mex, feel like it’s up their alley
i'm so jealous!
Next introduce them to Texas heat so they stop complaining when it’s 80 degrees outside 😂
I expect we'll be seeing a lot more Brits visiting Texas.  Welcome to all of you!
Haha you simply cannot eat ribs politely 😂😂😂
Those heinz beans come from Philadelphia Pennsylvania
American BBQ is the best food on earth. fight me about it
you have to butter the cornbred
I so much enjoy these vids 😁😁
Starting off with burnt ends is like the Walk Hard scene when Dewey walks in while they're smoking reefer. "You don't want no part of this."  Really jumped straight in the deep end with this one.
Cornbread should not crumble look or TASTE dry. Somebody did something wrong with that. I'm sorry they have you feels that atrocity PRETENDING to be corn bread. Add soon as I saw it I KNEW it "won't hittin' on NOTHING! "🤦🏽‍♀️ I do wish they had the fellas try the beans American style (not on bread)  first. 😏
Whoever gave y'all that cornbread recipe should be arrested. Cornbread should be flavorful! If it tastes like cardboard, someone screwed up.
Should have given them butter and honey for the cornbread!
You don't have ribs in England? Do you throw away the brisket cut from all your cattle?
These kids (and their headmaster), are an absolute joy to watch! 🥹💗
“They’ve won this time.” Since 1776.
I'd love to see their reaction to a Texas Twinkie 😂
I loved this. I was in the UK last month. I didn't care for the sausages. My first sausage was vegan, unbeknownst to me. I did try other sausages, but they were not to my liking. I enjoyed watching the boys and headmaster eat the beans and sausages.  I was surprised that most didn't care for the beans. I chose not to eat the poured out of a can beans when I was over there. Been there done that. 😅 These boys and the headmaster are so lucky to get to taste these foods. And I'm lucky to get to watch them do it. ❤
It's cracking me up that they ALL put their beans on bread. 🤣
British, immediately putting beans on toast…………. Really??? God yall are so British.
How do yall cook bbq over there?
Proof America has the best food.
Beans are off!
Poor kid. You can’t move to America anymore unless Taco tRump allows you too personally.
I love that one kid said he never tried pickles and then was like "oh they're like cucumbers but better" yes that is what they are lol😂
I see a business opportunity:  food tours of the American south
Im glad we are collectively offended about the cornbread comment haha. They didnt know how to serve it
I'm now hungry for barbecue 😋
How do they get thos caliber of food there? Do they fly in a pit master or something?
Glad to see y'all through a few of them blacks in there, nobody else is going to say it.
I worked for Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in 1988 and 1989. That sleeve-printed long sleeve T was de rigueur for season pass holders and weekenders alike. Hadn't seen one in 30 years. Thanks for the blast from the past!
I tried milkis.....its.....okay....not as hyped i thought it would....
LMAO. These young men just went to heaven.
Please put honey on that cornbread.  It's a sin to eat it dry.
I actually was relieved to hear other kids saying they disliked cornbread! Couldn't stand it as a kid and even if it was the only sweet part of a meal spread, I avoided it and wished for cake. BUT! Now I eat it sometimes. As a kid, it was the texture, the dryness, sort of bland (like one of the kids says!) and I thought corn was a weird flavor for dessert-like side stuff. It took a long time, but I came to appreciate it later on.
Southerners do not eat dry cornbread. It's always served hot with plenty of butter. I don't blame them not liking dry cornbread.
Finally, they eat real food. Actual Food.
‘I’m getting emotional’ 😂😂😂 Me too when that’s in front of me😂
The cc seems to have gotten out of sync in the middle of the vid
"You're the funny one" 😂
Texas motto is everything is bigger in Texas. Also better but that might just be Bias talking
They’re missing the jalapeños and onions
Where are the British  girls' school? As an American woman, I'd like to see girls try our delicious food! I would have a group of boys and a group of girls who like to eat.
I grew up and currently live in Texas. I’ve had barbecue an average of once a month for my entire life. We have an excellent barbecue restaurant just five minutes from my house. I didn’t realize how good I had it.
The disrespect for cornbread gotta grill that and serve it with cinabutter
Whoever they got the food from must not know how to make good cornbread.
Since you Brits love beans and toast, you need to let them try red beans with proper southern or Cajun sausage with cornbread. That may change their opinion on cornbread.
I'm a Floridian but lived in TX for 4 years and I MISS THE FOOD!
1:18 there's no way hes 9
Texas  bbq baby!!  , shout out to Tennessee , Kansas , & N.Carolina I see videos of y’all’s bbq everyday
😂😂
The BBQ beans don't go on toast (save that ridiculousness for your UK beans).  You eat them as they are.  They are a side that can stand on it's own.  Just grab a utensil (spoon/fork) and dig in.
I've unfortunately have never had Texas or Southern barbecue and wow does this food look amazing and delicious 😊😊
The cornbread did not look appetizing at all. Everything else did.
자막이 엉망이야 ㅜ
Please tell me Kayden is related to Jayden...
I imagine he (the headmaster) is kind of reconsidering that trip to Portugal, and thinking about heading to TX, instead.
blacks are not british
The cornbread needs some butter and honey (while it's still warm).  It should have been tasted before the flavor rich BBQ, 'cause the cornbread is not the main feature, it's a supporting side.
Omg we got new kids!
This is actually a plate for one person.
As per the cornbread, that’s gotta be a regional thing.  I’m in East Texas and have never had cornbread with BBQ.  Cornbread is for pinto beans, red beans and rice, and soul food.  If there’s bread at all, it’s Mrs Baird’s white bread!
Bring the boys and headmaster on a field trip to America
The fat in any version of American BBQ is a major contributor to flavor., the seasoning is generally pretty simple, centered around SPG (Salt/Pepper/Garlic), with maybe a few other seasonings added, by region.
They need to try jalapeño cornbread!
Well... Now you know why we Americans think that you British people have bland food 🤷🏼‍♂️
Cornbread can be amazing or meh,  depends on how it's cooked.  That cornbread looked very dry.  The cornbread I grew up with was moist and sweet and oddly enough from a simple mix called Jiffy.
When you have cornbread you normally add honey
You left out blackeyed peas with "snaps" ( immature peas in the shell broke up in 1.5 in. )cooked with bacon grease in it   The peas have to be cooked fresh, not dried blackeyed peas.
Are they really, all of them, british kids? REEEEEALLY?? 😂
Need butter or honey with the cornbread guys!
You’re welcome, boys! Love, Texas ⭐️ 🤠
That brisket is criminally overcooked and dry
I'm thinking the headmaster is definitely rethinking his choice of going to Portugal. 😂  It was awesome to watch the kids discover the wonder of properly spiced and cooked BBQ! 😁👍🏼
Is that Brad Pitt!!! Damn Mach!
Nice music 0:44
More please 😅
13:38 is the south gonna let this slide?
You can’t have plain cornbread, you have to slather it in butter!
That the cornbread was not served with butter is a desecration 😡
Hello British cousins!…there are few things as good as Texas BBQ, so glad to see these young minds trying it…the headmaster is awesome…
finally tasting the spices they pillaged the world for
Jolly introducing obesity to England.
Why is no one talking about the British brad pitt at 1:19 ??? Mack needs to play in a biopic for brad pitt 😂😂😂
Guys! You need butter with the cornbread!
really wish yall would stop with the AI art please
ummm some of these kids do not look like high schoolers?
Road trip with Mr. Smith, when?
You need butter with the cornbread 🤤
Svp par pitié mettez la au bac cette voix IA me rend malade
Boys became Men today
I cannot get over the fact, you called Arnold Bavarian, while serving him an Austrian, and Austrian dish. You want to know why you lost the stare contest, because he stare contempt. You called an Austrian a Bavarian. That's like calling a haitian a Jamacan or an irishman a scottish man. ......my german butt sae that and and I was like. Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. He doesn't even sound like he comes from Bayern. It's like a a londoner in liverpool or wales. Come on. Just no.... thisnis now comments where I am stressing you need to message herr schwarzenegger and FREAKING APOLOGIZE!!! Every German speakong country had shifty eyes like" ooooh, he didn't just say that"
In defense of cornbread I, it looks like they served it with no butter. Probably did taste like a crouton.
Unbuttered cornbread isnt cornbread.
As a Houstonian, I love to see this stuff! If you folks are ever in Houston, hmu!!! Bbq on me all day 😂❤️
The only way to eat cornbread is with honey butter.  Cornbread is never to be eaten plain.
Tell the kids to go to homebargains,they do the best ribs
Now they're starting to understand why Americans are so fat LOL! Need to send them to KC next!
As a native Texan, it warms my heart to see our extended family loving on our BBQ! Enjoy it kids!
My son and daughter in law are stationed in the UK… what they mostly miss in British food is “flavor” So every time they fly, they plan a long layover so they can leave the airport and grab tasty food! BBQ especially!
Theres no texas bbq over there more than likely because they serve sausage and pork products. Seeing as how yall r losing ur country to muslims (much like us in the usa) this is.more than likely thr reason. Take ur country back!
You need to bring Dave to the U.S.
im sorry i cant be the only one to notice, but is there a use of generative ai for the food in the top right corner? ):
We gotta get them to come for a visit, including the headmaster, so they can enjoy some good old southern hospitality and Texas BBQ! They need the whole experience!!
The USA National Anthem alongside the bone in rib is pure cinema. Makes me want to stand at attention 🫡 🇺🇸
I met a Texan person once at a party here in the Philippines to celebrate the baptizing of there new home and boii it was a decadent flavor when he made the brisket but sadly I don't eat too much when I drink tho...   But I can't anymore coz I'm just a plus one to that celebration...
First time I ever felt offended when the kid said dont ever make cornbread ever again 😂😂😢
I'd like to point out that Texas bbq owes some of its fame to the cattle it is made from. Well fed livestock is delicious even as hamburger.
Once you have eaten the meat the cornbread is like eating a crouton. LOL
These are lucky kids. Just think, if the U.S. didn't win the revolutionary war, this would have never been invented. You are welcome England!
I’m from Texas 🇨🇱 and this made me proud 💯💯
If I ever see headmaster in America im buying him a beer. What a great guy he always makes me laugh 😂
When you put the 2024 scene vs the current video of the boys, it seems incredible how they are growing up so fast! And it’s just last year! They all have such good responses, and also amazing vocabulary. That pair of boys, and also the one that said I’m in for the ride together with his friend, those 2 pairs are my favourite! Hope to see them more in future videos.
Hey guys. I have a question for you! Do you fly the British kiddos to America for these taste testings? I always wondered how you get all the fresh foods to them?
Yall should have given them cornbread the way we like to eat it here in South Louisiana! You take the cornbread while it’s still hot or at least warm and spread some butter on it and let it melt then drizzle some Steen’s Pure Cane Syrup on it! It makes it more like a dessert than a dinner side dish!😊
Those kids are obviously use to boxed Kraft Mac n' Cheese, and were thrown a bit off by the real deal.
Y’all are doing cornbread dirty!! lol You have to make honey butter cornbread. It will transform your thoughts about it. It’s buttery, sweet, moist, and truly addictive. You can even add cream corn into it to make it even better.  Many southerners will put cornbread in a glass of milk at night and have it as a midnight snack.
Hopefully they will start to understand the BMI of the average American.
ARMAX VS BUVNA IN A COOKING BATTLE
YAY MY FAV ARE THESE VIDEOS LETS GOOOOO
As a texan, its so fun to watch people discover our BBQ
Is Ollie wearing a Mammoth shirt??
It's impossible to diet in Texas.
Honey and bbq sauce on a Texas fold never fails
It’s so nice to hear black people speak properly. Can we swap?
British carnivores🤣🤣🤣😜😜😜
Young Harry really takes the time to taste and appreciate the food. ❤
Josh's laugh is way worse than Jimmy Fallon's. I think the most genuine laugh he showed was when he filmed with his mum. Like, relax dude
When they land in the USA they are no longer serfs living under an oppressive UK monarchy  To now feeling what it's like living as free men.  And the food and culture changes as well.
The Headmaster lost some weight
Texas does not have patents on this kind of BBQ. It's southern BBQ.
I just love the Headmaster's reaction...  He LOVES everything!!!
This almost makes me want to be back at school? How many of these kids are younger brothers of previous participants?
They're such a joy, every time lol😂
british food so bland everything else just tastes better lol
No vegan has ever reacted like this biting into any plant dish
These little British schoolboys are SO articulate! What a joy to listen to the way they describe what they're experiencing!
Oh Dave. You’re the man! 🤣 Love those boys. ❤️
Seeing the joy on British kids’ faces when eating legit American cuisine brings a smile to my face 😊
The cornbread was missing the butter and honey. Or the jalapeno chiles.
Y’all struck gold with the high schoolers! Always brings a smile to my face. ❤😂
British high-schoolers? 3 British kids in this whole video 😂 the rest are african and middle Eastern.
Southern cornbread may be different than the kind I make, but I use a teaspoon of lemon rind and 2 teaspoons of orange rind, and 3 tbsp sweetener along with equal amounts of cornmeal and flour.  We think it is pretty good to snack on as a treat.
As a Texan I'am glad these kids got to try and loved the best BBQ in the world, Texas BBQ!  Yall did Texas proud Josh and Ollie. Now it's time to show these young lads Authenic Mexican food Texas Style.
Bless those kids who think Brit’s beans are better than these ones. lol.
Grew up all my life in Texas and never  heard of Texas Fold. I think it's something Joshua Weissman just made up on the spot in another video.
Watching this, I may have to rethink my dislike of brisket! 😋🤩
7:47 the cornbread is something they’ve gotta have *BEFORE* you feed them the most delicious thing they’ve ever eaten in their entire lives 😂
There is nothing like being born and raised in Texas 🤠🤘
Add some sauce to be true TX Q.
13:40 kid gets treated to a southern barbecue meal and the one thing he says is don’t ever make cornbread again.  Don’t ever let me catch you in the streets kid
Thanks for making me hungry jolly
boys and food .. may you never grow old in spirit lads
Must suck not knowing what seasoned food taste like
"It's absolutely sublime." Said a 14-year-old. Yeah, we're not beating the allegations of poshness.
This is child abuse bro…you’re ruining food for them til the day they move to America or die. They’ll never be able to eat a British meal again without being sad😂
“I’ve never had ribs”   My American brain could not comprehend that sentence lol
You need to butter up that cornbread, brothers. You all just keep eating it dry x _ x
10:37  “ I don’t think I could eat food here anymore” 😂
I have never seen people eat ribs like that in my life wtf
Honey and butter mixed and then put on cornbread,  so good
How about some cornbread with sweet cream butter and honey?
I lived in Texas all my life and never heard anyone call that a Texas fold. It’s just a sammich
As a texan it brings me joy seeing food spices being shared and enjoyed freely
I could clean up opening a BBQ place over in London I think.
Ok Harry is the cutest, most lovely little boy 😭 he’s like a little Pixar character 🥹🩷🩵
I take it for granted living here in Texas. So many good bbq spots.
Them kids about to be sleeping good tonight
The automatic beans on toast was very British of them 🤣
Why do they put the meat on these white sticks?
British highschoolers go to America!???
What would they know about flavor?? 😂😂
COME ON YOU GUYS LET THE "SUCCULENT" KID  OUT OF THAT ONE?
In a way though, a brisket is an inferior version of a sunday roast
What would be the bounty ?
Those aren’t the right pickles. You need sliced dill pickles, specifically best maid dill. Kosher are trash.
And then they were fat.  Welcome to America
Alright, yall need to take Headmaster Dave and Ollie’s dad to the Michelin star  BBQ place now
How do yall transfer this overseas??
Well I made the mistake of watching this hungry.
These videos are always the best because of the variety of reactions  😂
how british highschoolers when there is no one indian in them 😂
Yeah, I think the headmaster needs to come with you guys on your next American adventure! 😆
Oops the cc went off timing from the ads onwards 😅
the kid that kept saying "that's lovely" is so adorable
My fav series
Texas is def the best but we all have to understand just about anything is better than beans on mf toast with no seasoning. Mfs are out there eating WWII rations
Every video shows Brits relishing American food.   No wonder millions came to America.
I cannot tell if the Headmaster is a Gourmand or a Glutton. Either way, I love his reactions.
Taste of real freedom
Amazing video but I think theres a problem with the subtitles
What is tyler durden doing in a youtube video
How to they get this authentic food made? Did they fly some guys from Texas and hook them up with the meat and a smoker??
Go drunk CC's you're home!!!
British beans are better? You mean the Heinz beans you eat that is an American recipe and company that was introduced to Britain during WW2?
Lol that one little guy was having the best time😂
😂 Harry and Kavan understand it!!
I had a really good smoked duck dish which I still can't forget the feel of having a really good food. I never had that experience again after that.
Why is it always guys on this channel?
Josh yall come to Tx again Austin w the Headmaster and i will treat yall to all the BBQ yall can eat,pick  the place. Headmaster seems like a really cool guy..he needs the whole experiance. the smells of walking in a Bbq joint..
I’ve never been so jealous!
"everything is better with bread in it" Ahhhhh......yes...i am sure the germans would agree
they all put the beans on toast hahahahaha! we don't do it that way in Merica lol. It brought me so much joy to watch this video
you guys ruined some parents meal time haha
That kid is recorded on video for the rest of his life telling all of Texas to never make cornbread again. 🤦‍♂️
"He's not lying" 😂😂
I found it amusing that everyone just automatically put the pit beans on the bread. Glad the guys all like the BBQ!
I’m in Austin and used to take my international students to Louie Mueller BBQ in Taylor every year. They don’t have as long a line and it’s still solid BBQ. Send these guys to Austin!! We’ll take them on a BBQ tour.
They now understand why we hella fat lol
You have to put the pinto beans on the cornbread
The boy with curly hair was having a moment for sure lol😂
What did ya'll do to the cornbread 😂😂😂
Luffy would have a field day at this
remember reading the comments under the video with the “texas fold” and seeing all the texans saying “we do not call it that” 😭
Ollie’s face when the kid didn’t like the crispy bits on the Mac 😂
This is why I laugh when foreigners try to say USA is burgers and fries or McDonalds. We do things differently here.
As a Texan, this is my favorite of your videos! Brisket is my favorite food.i love how EVERY ONE OF THEM LOVES IT!
If you're going to give people cornbread, at least make it good cornbread!!!! That stuff was dry and it looks like boxed cornbread!
Is it just me or Harry looks like little Goob from meet the robinson? Hes so cutee
What a cruel trick to play on them: Back to British scran after this meal, innit then. To the ol tin o' Heinz beans on toast. Keep calm and carry on, lads.
Butter that cornbread!
Love love love brisket❤❤❤❤
I just had one question how do you pick these lucky students to get the food. and why did you pick any girls for any of these videos
They got the entire Harry Potter movies extras for this video! that's crazy.
8:27 "a really horrible analogy" well, that's rich coming from you, ollie 😆
This is the FUNNIEST one ever!!!!!! The kids are great. I love the teacher!🤣🤣🤣
A good alternative to traditional cornbread for those who find the texture too crumbly is corn cakes. i personally cannot handle the traditional dry buttermilk cornbread either, and prefer a sweeter one with more moisture. I use jiffy cornbread mix and then fry it up on a griddle with lots of butter as little pancakes, so they cook fast without drying out. You can serve it with butter on top and your choice of honey. It also pairs super well with bbq.
졸리 일반 시리즈에도 한국자막 필요해요....!! 제발!
I live in Austin and have BBQ maybe twice a year. If you eat it like a glutton you don't want it as much!
Strange how the kids are grouped 😮like no mixing
I’m not even from Texas and this had me smiling ear to ear.
You have to take these kids and the Head to the US. Their reaction is pure class and so entertaining.
Cornbread should be eaten with butter and honey. (don't use margarine it must be BUTTER). Cornbread plain is bland.
The plain white bread is so useless 😂
9.99 for 5gb data?? Jesus. Expensive!! No thanks
The better take on cornbread is to pair it with pinto beans, aka soupy beans.  Beyond that? Glad they're getting the BBQ experience! It's the Texas style, instead of the Tennessee, but it's a start!
💖As a Texan, born & raised, this episode warmed the gooey-fat parts of my heart.😅 (Ollie never fails to make me laugh💗) Cornbread is ALWAYS best warm, with lots of butter. (Unless I'm having it cold, broken up in a glass, with cold milk poured over. Only about 3/4 the way up the level of cornbread. Spoonfuls of yum).   PLEASE bring Headmaster to Texas!  Killeen & Longview have some of the best BBQ, and we'd LOVE for ya'll to try it!!
I wanna see what happens when they experience the meat sweats for the first time
Are they cooking this food in the UK or flying it over? I can only imagine what these kids reaction would be if it was fresh
7 year olds go to High school in the UK?  Head Master Smith has his hands full.  Good luck with that.
Headmaster is hilarious 😂😂
why is this vid segregated jolly??
Listen now you gotta warn them, after you eat that much you gonna be TIRED LOL. They're gonna have the best sleep I'll tell you that much
If a person hated American bbq I would genuinely question their sanity.
Cornbread is sooooo good if it's made right. Louisianan here, and I make both a spicy cornbread and honey cornbread. Krustez has a honey cornbread mix that's delicious if you don't want to make it from scratch.
Please bring the headmaster to your next Texas trip
Does anyone know how they brought this to them? Did they use a local restaurant or was it frozen/flown back from Texas. I'm in the UK and am desperate to try this kind of food.
I feel sorry for there moms now lol they want barbecue now
now u know how limited the UK palate is, and this is only texas bbq...
I always wondered where you guys get this American food to serve to them
I love how Dave enjoys the food just as much as the kids do, perhaps more.
I knew that certain people in our country can not cook or season their food. But damn in the UK they dont grill, smoke, or season their food?
Cornbread should be served warm with tons of salted butter
Yeah, cornbread needs butter
Interesting.  60 years in Texas, and I never heard of a Texas Fold.
I can imagine the headmaster after having this grub say to the kids, right you can all go home now, im going back to my office to sleep for the afternoon 😂😅😂😅
Watching them all automatically just put the beans on the bread was the most British thing ever. Saying that they preferred Heinz bland beans was a close second.
Jolly, should come to New Zealand and come try our tucker
Alternative title: Brits once again realizing why the rest of the world calls their food bland.
Okay, as an African-American southerner, I think the cornbread and the Mac n cheese need a do-over. I could look at both and tell you that the cornbread wasn’t sweet or soft and the Mac n cheese…well, if it has breadcrumbs on top so that’s all I need to know. Maybe they should try African-American Soul Food (not southern food) if they haven’t already, and re-try cornbread and mac-n-cheese? Americans also don’t cook beans to be eaten with toast, so I definitely understand them not liking it. It’s a different flavor and texture.
STOP FUCKING SQUISHING THE JUICES OUT OF THE BRISKET!!!
lol the kids that this school produces year after year are really amazing. A real credit to Mr. Smith. And..I’m not a fan of the cornbread either without butter and honey on it!! 😂😂
6:19 giving me graduation flashbacks. Americans will understand what I’m saying.
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore." felt
You should had banana pudding! That's the cherry on top.
Always blows me away how well spoken these young students are compared to Americans lol
they need to put butter on the cornbread...yum
3:39 I was a little shocked by the comparison of them from 2024 to 2025. They grow so fast like Max.  😮
I remember this how i was when i first moved to Louisiana 😂😂.  Absolutely no reason why every city there slaps with its southern, creole, cajun, french take on the cuisine.
How are these people highschoolers? The oldest looks 12 and one of them is looks 7
Why do they have so many black kids when its a white country
The bathrooms after these episodes. 😂
"Land of Hope and Glory," synched to that big rib. Superb production values on this!
These videos alway make me so happy and strangely proud to be an American! (Even though I am from nowhere near Texas.) Wishing all these students so much happiness and success for the future, they seem like such good kids! And the headmaster is truly always a delight to see again - sharing the same sentiment as others in that I would love to see you take him on a food tour around the States, but especially for Texas barbeque!
Retired US teacher here. Never had a student use the word "sublime." These students are A-DOR-A-BLE!
Imagine their parents regrets letting their gremlins join this segment cause they wont stop talking about those flavors they tasted 😂
I NEED yall to go to Kansas City to try America’s best BBQ.  Ask Kansas City locals where to go.  The Internet will tell you gates, but that is the wrong answer. I would personally say Q39 but there are a lot of people in Kansas City that would have different opinions on where the best BBQ is. But I can almost guarantee that none of them will say Gates.   (real talk Texas barbecue is fire, but Kansas City barbecue is different and very good)
That Brisket looked heavenly.
I only JUST had dinner. I thought I was safe to watch this. How on EARTH did this make me hungry again!?
"It's like being hugged" sums up southern soul food perfectly
Wow
They were amazed by a 3/10 Texas bbq experience....Imagine they a had proper 10/10 experience in Texas. 😅
priceless!! Thanks JOLLY :-)
Loving their enthusiasm for good food 😊.
How do they get this food prepared in the UK?
TEXAS  BBQ 🏆
Pit beans? I'm from Texas, and I have never heard of pit beans.
Why they're eating with their hands aww 🤮
No high school in the UK 😂
I keep all my plastic utensils. They going to last forever 🤣 relics… too hard to find here in 🇦🇺
Still can’t understand why y’all using wooden spoons n forks. Surely a sofisticated school would supply proper utensils.
1:16 yeah see this is why Englishmen aren't given good things. 6:55 Especially when they all bit into the ribs was like and Englishman discovering what food is like with flavor and actual seasoning lmao T-T 7:26 WHAT do you mean "too much flavor"  T_T 7:50 like a basic british diet then  11:38 BRO cba like :D
❤❤❤
Josh and Ollie talking like they’re pros at eating ribs… they got told off for trying to eat ribs with a knife and fork.
I LOVE these episodes!! They are all going to have food coma when they're done eating lol 😆.  Corn bread is disgusting 😫.  10:36  "I don't think I can eat food here anymore" lol.
Only children choose. Adults will get a slice of everything.
"you're the funny one" I know...
Cornbread without butter no thank you
Dear Americans. This food was bought/prepped in the UK. It's actually British food in Texan style
Y’all need to bring the Headmaster to America!
Can't lie, would love to experience this one day
These are always some of my favorite episodes. I get such a kick out of watching all the kids' different reactions to things- and the headmaster's, too. Jolly good fun! ❤ (Now I'm craving some good barbecue. 🤤)
While my country is regularly doing truly disgusting awful things around the globe daily, this channel is maybe the only thing that ever makes me feel patriotic.
Well, English dishes are bland, not surprised why these kids are in awe😂
You know the food's good when you roll your head back an it nearly comes off. I had Texas BBQ for the first time last Thanksgiving while visiting family. It was stupendous! I went from never having brisket to eating all the brisket. Ohhhhh dear God, it was tasty! Those kids and the headmaster are going to sleep gooooood tonight!
American here:  I couldn't be prouder hearing this sentence come from the future of England. 10:37 "I don't think I can eat food here anymore." We'll let that cornbread comment slide.... this time😈
Honestly there's nothing better than baked beans with a barbecue people usually make the barbecue baked beans and the best baked beans are kidney beans with brown sugar molasses ham mustard salt and pepper and you don't eat them hot you eat them lukewarm or cold
And now you understand why we Americans are overweight. Enjoy Brits!
Reminds me of the hyenas in lion king.
Hi @jolly, not to sound disrespectful, but rarely do we see a Try video with women/lady guests. Im not exactly sure how to put this, but we all love you and your videos, but there is a larger crowd out there missing out. Love from India <3
Mr Smith is the most hilarious in every reaction 😂
Someone needs to serve them some proper Boston baked beans or southern pork 'n' beans
2:29 Kid 1 - "It melts in your mouth" Kid 2 - "You're lying" *eats brisket* "He's not lying" 😂😂😂
I'm guessing whoever prepared the food isn't really great at making cornbread flavorful or any of the side items, for that matter
Something is wrong with the subtitels or is that just for me?
people ask why americans are fat? cuz the food is so good
Taylor, TX used to have Louis Mueller's and Rudy Mikeska's.  I believe it was Mikeska's that seasonally offered bear, rattlesnake, goat, venison, and alligator. Only got to try one of the "truly local" specialties,  goat. It literally melted in my mouth. Used to bbq my own brisket over mesquite.. took 24 hours, had to get up every 3-4 hours thru the night to feed the fire, but OOHHHH, the flavor, tenderness, juiciness!!  I love your cids! They make me tear up. "Cry for happy"!
It´s sad british people only know fish and chips or beans. There is not one good british cousine out there. even their breakfast looks like puke from the day before.
Bring these guys to the U.S. and do a tour!
One question…. How many of them had the meat sweats and went into a food coma? 😎🇨🇦
Is this where I watch TEXUS Englishman?
Headmaster Smith has kept himself lean to survive Josh and Olly's food tasting challenges hahahaha
Had about the worst day I could without someone dying, but seeing this made me chuckle quite a bit. Thanks 😊
Well, actually it's very easy to impress Brits with food ... as they don't have any good/tasty food in their own country! XD
I cried when they all started putting the beans on the bread lmao.
Jolly getting Joshified
No real British highschooler looks like they do.
I love watching these British kids trying different foods.
I love watching Brit’s eat something that is actually seasoned lol.
10:15  that snap
There is hope yet for society. These young boys were so polite and respectful.
"British"
Next one better be Southern desserts. Be sure to say "sorry" to the headmaster before giving his students all that sugar. 😂 If you guys need a list of what to give, I have a quorum.👍🏻
I honestly think that trying foods from around the world should be part of the curriculum here in the uk.
Harry was having a spiritual journey the entire time.
I smoked a brisket last week I was up at 4 am lighting the bbq
You can tell the principal has a much more refined taste then the students lmfaoo
Everytime someone eats something  "Whoooooaaa"
"its bigger than my head"   you can't let the Brit students have it all by themselves not without the Headmaster XD look how he roll his eyes from the Texas Fold.
Nunca pensé que los británicos probarían el verdadero sabor de Texas tan rápidamente, eso sí que es valentía con la comida picante. ¿Qué otros platos americanos creen que deberían intentar?
Who invited Jimmy Kimmel
They gotta try north Carolina cornbread 🔥🔥
American BBQ is heaven on earth!!!
That cornbread looks doggy
I love that u played Pomp and Circumstance in the background
would have been kinder to give them crack
Those Dino ribs are delicious. The better the grade the better the ribs
The British high schoolers are getting younger and younger.
kids dont like while headmaster "oh my goodness 😍🤤" 🤣
Please do this for uni students too
바베큐 너무 맛있겠다
Josh Weissman lied to y'all about the Texas fold. That's not a thing. We just make brisket sandwiches f
In America we have a rich, excuse the pun, beef industry thanks to the Spanish introducing the cattle early on. It helps that there is endless grassland around the middle part of the country. This results in a huge amount of people cooking beef in many different but fun ways
Hopefully now they understand why Americans are so big
You need butter for the cornbread
ohhhh you guys did good on this. Also, good call on using the less fatty brisket for the Texas fold, they can get sloppy so having the extra meat texture is key
Cornbread in a cold cup of milk (raw onions optional) is one of the best things
The child who dipped the pickle in the milk, are we sure they are not pregnant cause that is an interesting combo.
the headmaster reckon if u leave him alone he'd finish it off all by himself 🤣
To be fair, that cornbread did look really dry.
Yes!!! Just love these vids with the British school boys
Only serial killers eat dry corn bread.  Its best with honey butter
Aghr this is what I've been waiting for this makes my day! Me and my friend watch these videos at school when we are bored it's legit the best 😂😂🎉
These people suffer from horrible producers and 'talent'.  Cornbread is NOT SERVED OR EATEN alone.  Those two little slabs should have been served IN that little bowl of beans.  Or at least served warm with butter.  Cornbread is served with chili or stews - like that bowl o' beans.  What morons!!   And serve Pork Ribs FIRST and Beef Ribs LAST.  Or just one kid.
I love your videos but I can't help but notice that every time you involve Highschoolers is gives me the distinct impression that Britsh high schools are segregated.
I love cornbread. Freshly baked in a cast iron pan and topped with whipped honey butter (salted with not too much honey) and you have right there a super delicious side. I tend to like the chili - cornbread pairing more, but it's also good with bbq. Still, I would probably rather have steak fries or fried okra, if I could only have one side with American bbq though.
The vocabulary is impressive!!
That one young man looks like a young brad pitt.
This Texas fold thing is about to become known worldwide, except in Texas XD
Josh and Ollie are the best at showing the best parts of the US. Its awesome to see these kids ( and the head master) enjoying the food so much
The way these young men just start plowing in with both hands, all etiquette out the window -- they've been corrupted in the best possible way.
As an American who has always said that steak and barbecue from Texas is one of the greatest culinary things that America can bring to the table I am so happy to see this
That mop bucket dispersal kid is going places. Haha
Well, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for my day off work.  But, now I want to go to the local BBQ place, and get a bunch of stuff.  I'll get a burger, a bunch of onion rings, and a pound of brisket.  I can turn that brisket into a couple meals at home.
Those guys will never enjoy a roast beef dinner like they did before you corrupted them with Texas BBQ beef.
Ribs look trash
Brilliant love all you do but really love you bringing new food and flavour to the school boys.
I love these videos. Watching the genuine reactions of these kids is priceless.
Oh my goodness I might have to go to Texas LOL
you are still promoting the US? are you insane? this has not only always been annoying and gross, nowadays it is scary!
Seeing the joy and surprise from them is great lol.
Wait is beef sausage not a thing in the UK or is it just other meats chosen over Beef?
one thing they didn't tell yall about cornbread is 2 things. butter smeared on it and make the cornbread with jalapeños diced chunks. Makes the flavor pop out. Hope that helps.
Rich wiggas
when u said are u going anywhere this holiday, i thought u were gonna say Korean trip part #3
Would it be too English to ask for a knife and fork?
You can see the headmaster has been putting in work, he looks a lot more healthier and leaner!
The kids are funny but the teacher gets me everytime, "this is the best thing you've ever brought" LOL.
oh man after watching this, I need to find some local brisket...too bad I'm a couple states away from Texas  :D
Elgar, loving it, the best Australia can do is Percy Grainger and Peter Sculthorpe
Absolutely loved watching these boys indulge in real brisket and barbecue. When it comes to the cornbread, it can be hit or miss depending on who makes it. It would be better warm with butter or served with some collard greens, smothered cabbage or a nice bowl of chili than with barbecue. The white bread is plenty with barbecue😋.
Just let you know that the subtitle aren't sync because of the ad section  I'm fine without sub but sometimes British accent is hard to understand for non-native like me lol
13:45 that kid is basically you, Josh. Why u complaining abt him not likingit, U always force ollie and everyone to agree with you in terms of food
I think the headmaster planning a trip to Texas at this point
🥰 Zadok the priest, love that music
When is Jolly going to take the Head Master and some of the 18 year old students to America for a tour of the places you guys have gone to?  Seeing them at Terry Black's, Bucee's, HEB etc. would be epic.
I'm a little sad some of them didn't like the cornbread; if ate right between meats it helps palate cleanse so when you go back in for more, the flavor of the meat hits you again ^^;
Them poor gotta go home to fish n chips after this
See why we're all fat? 😂
They should've given them some honey butter for the cornbread 🤤
All these young men are thin. If they ate like this every day, they would be fat and unhealthy. Many Texans are obese.
With the World so divided and in chaos, this channel gives me hope. We Are All Human. Peace
Something about filming kids eating a giant messy pile of meat with their bare hands in a school library is terrifying but hilarious 😂
Headmaster has lost some weight!  Looking good!!
I have never had food from Texas...but I would be willing to go to Texas just to have an opportunity to eat this stuff.
The corn bread wasn't made right, for sure.
to be fair i have had a bad cornbread before and maybe that was just one of them. but some are so amazingly delicious i could just eat that alone.
Hello from Denmark both of you should try our The national dish of Denmark and " ribben-sandwich - (Porkbelly-sandwich)" and maybe our hotdog...not but at least a soda called JOLLY-TIME (like Sprite)😉😉
Can you guys organize a trip to America for the kids and headmaster? The kids parents would have to help cover costs of course. I remember doing a German exchange program when I was in school and it was life changing for me ❤
They should have served the cornbread with honey butter.
The little curly headed dude was really enjoying that 😂
They're all going to have diarrhea in an hour. If you are not used to eating that rich; spicy....your stomach is going to react big time.
Now you are making me hungry... tomorrow I will be ordering some BBQ, including burnt ends
I love these boys! Their reactions and comments are priceless! Such little gentlemen. ❤
why do you think americans are so fat
Harry is the next star. Mark my words.
0:51 zaedok the priest is a vibe !  I listen to it in the gym
I love to see people from other countries enjoying American food. It might sometimes seem that America just steals and bastardizes foods from other countries, but we actually know a thing or two about cooking. You can tell by our weight 😂
Engineer team fortress 2 would say: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE- BOOOM💥💥💥💥💥
Kids are never gona wanna eat food over in the UK again, next video they'll be over here in the U.S.! 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤❤
These kids will remember this meal for the rest of their lives.
The beans on toast😂😂
Mr. Smithhhhhhhh!!!!
Yeah Texas BBQ will do that.
Some of these kids first sexual experience was with BBQ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙄 Yes folks, BBQ IS THAT GOOD! 🤣🤣🤣🤣IYKYK
hahahah love their reaction with the pickles. hahaha
Brings joy to my heart seeing British people enjoying one of the true joys of America, BBQ those kids minds were blown away
i love how yall tried texas bbq and now must show everyone ahhahaha.
Headmaster thinking about that time he was offer a job in Texas and rejected it and now regretting it.
Their poor stomachs!
Mates! Y’all need to have the cornbread with beans! Especially slow cooked pinto beans. You get the bean liquid like a soup almost, with some butter. Use the cornbread to dip in it. Some folks crumble it into it. I personally like those pinto beans cooked with an onion, garlic and sometimes a jalapeño or two. Add some herbs and spices if you wish. A bit of thyme, bay leaf. Definitely black pepper and salt. Bbq baked beans (even from a tin) are also nice with cornbread. Charro beans are nice. Cilantro is a nice touch for charro and pinto beans at the end. Cornbread can be sweet or savory. It’s very easy and fast to make. Please, I encourage you to experiment with this southern American staple and find a recipe you like. You can even make it in a cast iron pan. And you can make actually make it sweet enough to be a desert with some butter cream frosting, jams, or with fresh fruit and a little maple syrup drizzled on it with some warm, melty butter. There are many versions of cornbread so please keep trying it until you find your favorites. Oh, and cheddar and jalapeño corn bread is also excellent! Cheers!
That one kid who is literally high cuz of food. lol
About time y’all bring actual food Americans eat
I had BBQ for lunch today. Texas BBQ is awesome, but there are other states each with their unique BBQ style, they are all great. But, being in Texas, I especially love Texas BBQ.
Where is the potato salad? Other than that...happy to see the kids enjoy their BBQ.
Need some molasses and n that cornbread!
that kid looks like pete davidson
Headmaster thinking about moving to America
They ought to be American ambassadors now.
but its burned
eating cornbread without honey or butter is just tragedy in real time
Enjoy it now lads, in a few years you'll be eating lamb and hummus while your  son Mohammed recites the Quran.  Losers.
There's nothing more true than a Brit saying "I wish it was more bland"
It’s not tea it’s five pounds of sugar no lie
Yep, I'm now having bbq for dinner tomorrow night!
Texas brisket is amazing - source: I'm a Texan
Wow
proper private school kids reaction 🤣 love how eloquent they are in expressing things  an average schoolkid would just say fucking hell
my fav phrase, "its lovely" aweeee
Come try different states BBQ Carolina BBQ is my personal favorite
Cornbread always tastes better with butter lots of it
Headmaster, all that weight you lost ... you just put all back on in one meal. Worth it, but ...
Yes! You need to shout out the chef! I really kinda hope it is Gabby  😁
You should have added cream corn
"British highschoolers experience the concept of flavor for the first time"
Giving them burnt ends to start was a smart move.
This is called (Flavor)
You're the funny one!😂
These poor children are being ruined with flavor before our eyes.
Never thought a British kid would call another countrys food bland lol. Cornbread is king!
Plain corn bread is wild.  Some honey butter or something.  I don't know anyone that eats plain corn bread without even something to dip it in.
12:42 The most British utterance ever uttered 😂😂😂
Now was that cornbread buttered?
💙
The kid has definitely alienated himself from the south with that cornbread comment 😂😂😂
Those boys are about to learn all about the meat sweats.
Where in the UK did you buy this, please?
Southerners eat corn bread with something like a beef stew, chili, tomatoes and okra, etc……
With cornbread you NEED butter and honey or agave. All looks fantastic. An American kid's 1st thought would not be to put beans on bread.
Yeah, Texas BBQ is hard to beat. Kansas City is up there.
13:43 tell that lil kid that fish and chips are ass please and thank you
"Thank you sir may i have anotha"
Yep, now i'm starving! 🤣
Nobody eats cornbread by itself, we eat it with beef and bean chili sour cream and cheese on top.  Or cornbread and milk.  The simplest way is some butter or butter and honey spread on a piece.
13:40 Not our fault you are eating it WRONG! 🤠
Shout out from San Antonio! This was a so fun to watch! Love others loving Texas BBQ as much as we do!!
our beans rule.. bland beans suck
to be fair.. cornbread is better when it's not eaten plain.. it's better with butter and honey.. or in a soup like chili..
Give the boy some butter or honey for his cornbread
As a 5th Gen. Texan, I sure hope that you made sure the cornbread was "sweet cornbread"!
I enjoyed this video! I will say as a girl from Mississippi, there are different ways to make mac and cheese and different types of sides and cornbread. Everyone makes their sides different. I sincerely enjoyed this video and the reactions!!❤❤
Need some Iberico ribs, those looked a little skinny. :) Funny video!
That must have been some crappy cornbread. Made right it's a dessert all by itself, made even better with some honey or dipped in chili, etc.
This is why us Americans are the way we are
They need honey butter for the cornbread...
Taking new food experiences to the schoolboys and their headmaster are my favorites of your content. The kids are just so great and who doesn’t love Mr. Smith? Please keep doing these.
well mum knows now
mack looks like a young brad pitt
OMG, Harry looks like that kid from Meet the Robinsons. Looks like Michael Yagoobian
This might be your greatest video. Im from the south U.S. Barbeque is common here. Yet I feel the same way about BBQ as them, even now. 😂
I know its been said 10000 times. But but the next America tour has to have hedmaster Dave in it. That man's reactions are priceless
Cool video. Just one observation as a Texan, no one calls it a Texas Fold lol
i was crying laughing at the bean portion. "its better than sewage water" hahaha. and "they've won this round", as if heinz beans aren't american hahahah
They need to try my Mama's cornbread!
Cornbread has to be warm and needs a heavy coat of butter to fully be enjoyed.
this will trigger a bbq revolution in the europe
As a born an raised Texan this warms my heart so much! We really are spoiled growing up with the best BBQ in the world 🥹
Do you make it yourself? Or do you send it from USA?
i hope joshie made all this on his kamado. and my goodness mack hit his growth spurt early...he must wreck kids on the rugby pitch
When will you share with the gals?
These poor guys discovering flavor for the first time.
And then, all of those boys got their first case of the meat sweats. 😂
Love how Ollie is wearing a Mammoth Mountain shirt
I grew up in Louisiana, and the trick I learned about cornbread was to replace 25% to 50% of the water with canned corn juice. It's really really good.
The food in the UK is so terrible that eating basic BBQ is like a whole new world to them 😂
i like this school home series 👌
Jolly could change the channel name to American Englishman and I don't have any problem with it
So, for every Brit who thinks Americans are fat, I present exhibit A. Consider that we have food like this with FLAVOR and if we’re not fat, it’s a lot of self control, or a lack of tastebuds.
The boys are so cute and funny. We like the mac and cheese to be more bland. 🤣The boy named Mac looks like a young Brad Pitt.
Monty and Fred ftw
That guy looks like Brad Pitt
day number 638 of asking to get the headmaster a coke sponsorship
Man i love Mr Smith, the kids change but Mr Smith gets to taste EVERYTHING, lucky sob lol.
You've got to take the headmaster on tour with you sometime. I love the guy.
I wonder how they would like Johnnycakes or hot water corn bread, or maybe some wonderful fresh corn tortillas, compared to traditional cornbread.  Also maybe a sweetened cornbread vs a savory.
Yeah I’m only here for the headmaster
As an American born and raised in NC I think “southern style” sweet tea is too sweet . To this day . I drink unsweetened tea .
cornbread is from America silly
The kid on the left at 0:50 looks like Colin Creevey from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets 😂😂😂🤗🤗
"It's like cucumber but better" LOL
Justice for cornbread
The HEADMASTER deserves a TRIP TO THE USA 👏🇺🇸✌️😎
high school? these kids look like they're 10 years old, lol.
😆🥰 Glad you enjoyed!  I'm partial to cornbread in the cast iron though. 😋
HARRY'S VOICE IS LIKE A CARTOON CHARACTER😁
The headmaster sounds like he wants more meat totally!!! He hums when he taste the different meat!❤
Wait... No sauce? I mean a proper sauce is a delicacy.
if they didnt like the cornbread, it wasnt made right
And now y’all know why we Texans make a big deal about where we’re from.  After this when you see someone who has been to Texas you kind of will have this connection.  This innate little glance of acknowledgement that you too have experienced that indescribable feeling.
9:08 The best compliment one could receive/give. 😂😂😂
Need to slather butter on the cornbread!
Bring the Professor to Texas
Oh young lad, you have thrown the gauntlet, your school is going to be inundated with about 120 different recipes of cornbread for you to try to say this isn't nasty. Cornbread is very hit and miss.
British high schoolers go to America 🇺🇸 ❤
As a Texas this is such a compliment.
Cucumbers but better, my word.
Love seeing the boys and Headmaster Dave enjoy the Texas bbq. Headmaster Dave, lookin’ good! 👍🏽 Fit and healthy as they say.
The corn bread from were they got this bbq must of not been good but most bbq places have amazing corn bread!!!!
These kids and the headmaster are great! They look quite jolly!
have them try the cornbread fresh baked still hot with butter melting through it
Please put butter on the cornbread before you eat it.
I think the mental expiation of the cornbread was to be similar to sponge cake, as the one said?  Not that they didn’t like it but it wasn’t really what they expected it to be.
Headmaster lookin more handsome than ever these days 😍
Kansas City or New Orleans BBQ next.
That corn bread looks dry as hell
Don't let the food fool you - America is slipping towards authoritarianism/fascism and won't be a place you'll want to visit by the end of the current administration. No one is really doing anything about it or able to resist it in a meaningful way because most American voted for and are happy with this direction.
A lot of just grillers.
Errfrey fings be'er wif bread innit?
Kids were great fun, so was the headmaster. A little help: "fatty brisket" is called the point. "lean brisket" is the flat. They are two separate muscles in the brisket, grain running in different directions, which is why you cut a brisket in half,  slice the thinner side across the brisket, and slice the thicker side along the brisket.  And, I would like to apologize for the pork ribs, not nearly enough meat on them. Beef ribs looked great.
Title should be: "British highschoolers try seasoned food for the first time"
Bring the headmaster to the USA have him try Texas bbq and everything else yall have tried over here
Extra sugar is commonly added to canned beans and modern sliced bread; that is likely why the kids didn't like the Texas beans. Your tastes change as you age, so maybe they will one day. I say this because the headmaster and hosts seem to actually prefer the Texas style beans.
Nobody understands in Europe when I tell them I want American BBQ. They never understand how great it is ❤
I am glad you gave those kids some real Southern food instead of all that junk food.
Love Ollie's Mammoth Mountain shirt! And the BBQ looked good too.
try blacks bbq in smiley texas its the if not one of the best bbq in texas
I don't think the head master ever not liked anything. But this was definitely a real treat for everyone. Love the videos guys!
You two have single handedly ruined these poor kids 😂
I miss the old JOLLY studio like on "Weirdest McDonald's burgers you’ve never heard of!"
Who supplied the BBQ for this video, and can I order some delivered?
Finally you brought the British Students Back! Well done 👍🏼
That brisket doesn't look tender at all. Good brisket falls apart by gravity alone, and that mac looked dryer than the desert.
Please do more high school videos!!! THEY ARE AMAZING AND AWESOME!!!!!!!
As a native Texan, listen to the child about the cornbread! It's only good for dressing.
These kids have been deprived. Never have eaten a pickle or Mac & cheese. And why was that kid confused that we had beef sausage in the US? Did he not think we had cows or something??
Jeez Louise, right now, I really miss being at my daughter's house in Lockhart, TX. Black's, Terry Black's, Chisholm Trail... Hell, I'd even take Bucees in New Braunfels!
Also...combine the mac and cheese with the beans.
I loveeeee this series with highschoolers❤
It's midnight here and I had to stop watching because this vid was making me hungry
I love the kids and how they say they want to go to America. Maybe when they’re older they can go to America just like how the other kids went to Korea
Should’ve saved the brisket last because that’s the best
As a fellow Texan, I love this
Ahh yes my weekly diet as a Texan
You need some jam or even butter on the cornbread.
brits discovering seasoning is so fun to watch. the way they describe the experience. forever changed lol.
why the hell that one kid looks a lot like rami malek
Cornbread really is a hit or miss, not every place makes it the same.... haha
Omg give those people some freaking butter!
Soak the cornbread, dumb dumb.
The cornbread needs to be slathered with butter and drowned with honey. 😁
Never had ribs before? Like how? Am I just really American? Even if you don't eat BBQ (not even Chinese BBQ ribs??), how does one not encounter ribs in any form? Not even beef ribs? Short ribs?
With the cornbread, one can pour a little honey or syrup on it.
Never had ribs before? Like how? Am I just really American? Even if you don't eat BBQ (not even Chinese BBQ ribs??), how does one not encounter ribs in any form? Not even beef ribs? Short ribs?
Eating cornbread dry is a travesty. Slather that up with some real butter! Cheers from Dallas!
That cornbread was incredibly crumbly indicating a lack of egg.
Maybe they would like Northern cornbread more? 😉😂 And WHERE did you get this scrumptious BBQ from in the UK?!
Is there a Texas barbecue place in England?
Never stop doing this series.  Their honest reactions are priceless.   Makes me smile 😂
🎉🎉🎉🎉
UK just learned why American are fat.  The food is sooooooo goood you cant stop eating it.
And now you know why us Americans are so fat ;)
You put butter on corn bread!
@Jolly Are you wearing a Mammoth ski resort long sleeve shirt and did you go there? If so, how'd you like it(I'm from California and have been going there for over 40 yrs.) ? Also, did you guys go to Bishop CA. and visit Schat's Bakery?
more of these plsssss
It takes a true southern black mama to perfect cornbread, most people make it dry and crumbly. I'm not a fan of cornbread but one time... oh my days! It was the best thing I'd had. Same as grits, takes a lot of skill and experience to get it right.
The kid with curly hair reminds me of Colin Creevey from HP 😂 SO cute haha food looks great!
I can tell you first hand that they are not overselling how good it is.
I love you guys, you dont need to use AI, come on.
Jahsiah, David (both year 9s) and Harry (year 7) have amazing reactions! They're the standouts for me
Texas born and raised, eaten more Texas BBQ than I'd care to admit. I've never, ever heard ANYone use the term "Texas Fold"    Love these videos though, this one hit close to home. Was all the reactions I was expecting. Think I need to move to England and open up a Texas BBQ joint.
Did I see a young Brad Pitt? These kids are so lucky! First time being on the series and BANG! Got Texas BBQ right away. How are they gonna adjust back to normal food 😅😅😅
Brits discover flavor
Cornbread NEEDS to be buttered!! 😁
cornbread is ass
Show them a slice of "heaven" and then snatch it away, never to be seen or tasted again. Cruel!!!!!
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore"   BOOM!
You need to take them on a pilgrimage to Texas so they can try the best.
Did any of them get meat sweats? That was a lot of meat to be feeding them. Plain cornbread needs butter or gravy.
Tyler Durden has been fighting again with that brace on his wrist
I feel like the principal really understands us Texans on a primal level. I think he'd enjoy it here.
As a Texan, I'm so happy that the kids are enjoying the BBQ 🍖 May I suggest next time you serve the cornbread with lots of butter.
3:51 never tried a pickle?!?!
Cornbread needs honey butter!!! Oof.
They don't know how to eat corn bread. You need to put butter and honey on it.
The older boys had Korean BBQ, these boys are eating Texas BBQ. The love shown through these platters is unmatched. The headmaster is one lucky guy. Cutie pie
I love the way the British kids immediately put the beans on their bread, something you'd never see an American even imagine doing.
It's such a HUGE joy to see you return to these wonderful boys and their headmaster to give them another adventurous dining experience. Their reactions are sincere and honest, but always polite. They are so lucky you can provide them with these culinary moments over the years, and I absolutely adore them all. Of all your food critics you share these dining opportunities, the boys of Fulham and Mr. Smith the headmaster are the best and most brilliant. May they continue to have an exciting education, and grow up to become some of the finest gentlemen in the UK. God bless them all, and thank you for sharing this presentation with everyone here! ❤
Learning what British kids think is normal food will never not amaze me. Ranch dressing, dill pickles, Carolina bbq... I feel like I need to be more grateful for where I live purely because of the cuisine.
I completely understand not liking cornbread. I went to school at a rural school and there was an annual tradition where we’d celebrate the past. That meant dressing up as folks from the 1890s. And every year for lunch they’d serve us plain beans and cornbread. And keep in mind that by the time we had gotten to lunch we’d already had Native American fried bread cooked by the teachers who were from the Kaw, Ponca, and Tonkawa nations, three-sisters stew cooked by the teacher the teacher who was Muskogee(Creek) nation, some type of chili, and homemade bread with homemade butter (I should state that we helped in the making of these items). And the highlight of the day was usually singing folk songs while making homemade ice cream. It’s only as I have gotten older that I’ve grown to appreciate cornbread, but only as a side with certain dishes (stew or chili usually). But yeah as a kid and teen I didn’t really like it. I ate it during that one time of year because it felt like tradition to do that (and then you graduate school and realize that most adults don’t do all that; heck not even all the schools in my state do that!).   Overall they liked the food. This school must love when you show up with foods for them to try!!!
Corn bread is very American. I think it was my favorite part of any meal as a kid.
The tea bit is hilarious
Imagine if they actually ate real Texas BBQ. That brisket still looked mid and firm lol.
The way these kids stuck in, I half expected to hear a, "Please, sir, I want some more!"  🤣
I know they took a good nap after that
I am waiting for the moment the students just flat out say, "No wonder why Americans are so fat! Their food is amazing!"
Tell the kid to drizzle honey on the cornbread. That’s how we do it here if we don’t have chili to dunk it in
Same have Kansas more rib BBQ restaurants each different and state each more rib BBQ and home cook people .
Saying this as an American, sadly, great BBQ is one of the only good things America is producing since Nov 2024 😔
We’re in Austin right now to eat at LaRoy & Lewis, Interstellar, Discada and Dai Du.
did a british kid just say something tastes like paper when british people season meat pies with water?!?!
You all are Ruining 😂these poor kids palates
Why does the cc not match the audio?
OMG! You have a new set of children! I can't wait!
Corn bread needs beans or butter and honey
How did you get authentic Texas BBQ in the UK????
that really is one of the things we do best, bbq. and there are regional differences, but i'd say whether it's texas, the carolinas, nashville, st. louis or kentucky, it's better than anywhere else i've tried. argentina and south korea come close, argentina for the quality of the meat but the flavor profile isn't quite it.
I love these reaction videos.. I've grown up eating this food.. Even a pig roast and these kids have no idea what it tastes like.. It's awesome to experience other cultures food. I live in Michigan and we have so many different food options it would blow those kids minds!! Give them an authentic Mexican street taco.. I'd love to see their reaction.
Now you have to send those kids back to eating school lunch tomorrow.
Britain in a nutshell:  Ollie: Oh you want it to be more bland? Kids: Yea
I have a brisket on the smoker right now for tomorrow night's dinner. 👍 Glad they enjoyed our BBQ.
Add butter and honey to your corn bread
Amazing young gentleman, pity we don't have that type here.......
Poor British kids have been so shocked by flavor at once they have to chase it with bread to bring their tastebuds back down to earth lmao
I kept wondering where the butter was for that cornbread? Makes a big difference!
반응에 환장하는 한국사람들은 외국꺼에는 관심 없지 ㅋㅋㅋ
Proud to be Texan‼️‼️ ❤️❤️
It still baffles me that the British Empire, which at one point owned like half the world, fought LITERAL wars over spices....and yet now are known for having the blandest foods!!! Like somebody just one day went, "Oh, now that we've lost all our territories, i guess we can't use any spices anymore"...and everyone just went along with it
lol that negative nancy, after all that taste changing experiences ... he focuses on the cornbread that he personally didn't like lol.
You're the funny one!
"Straight in with your hands" Hey, they saw Eric chew you guys out ;) !
E-Girls: ❌ E-Sims: ✅
Try Hawaiian luau food.
These kids make our kids look like cavemen. So incredibly well spoken. The way they describe everything is superb. Love it.
Im so glad these kids can experience the opportunity too taste flavor, beans on toast just isn't comparable to burnt ends.
Wait how did you bring that to them?
Big ups on the Mammoth Mountain shirt 🤘🏽 born and raised there. Love it, and love the content as always 🔥
Did you guys use the edible silverware
I'm so glad you're going back to the school! I love all the boys you've filmed with.  The video caption was a few seconds ahead of the video if you can keep an eye out and fix that or make sure it doesnt happen in the next video. I use the captions to watch videos. Thank you,  Much love!
No girls???
We do use a fork though 😂😂😂😂 need sweet cornbread with butter, some beans, fried okra, and corn on the cob.
Lil' Bro really has a major dislike for cornbread!
I have missed those kids' unfiltered comments sooo much! Welcome back lads! Great job!
I love these authentic reactions!
As a Texan who eats brisket regularly, I may have to start saying how “lovely” it is 😂
As a Texan I love watching these guys try Texas bbq. However until jolly I had heard of a Texas fold. I’m just used to calling it a sliced brisket sandwich
As a Texan I love watching these guys try Texas bbq. However until jolly I had heard of a Texas fold. I’m just used to calling it a sliced brisket sandwich
How about food from somewhere like Cracker Barrel or Lamberts?
From apprentices to sorcerers talking about texas folds haha cheers jolly mates
give em jersey mikes
As a Texan I found this very interesting, but I feel you left off the potato salad and corn on the cob(though corn on the cob might be a normal food in England). Corn bread here is such a staple, and we make our dressing(or some call it stuffing) out of it for Thanksgiving--it is so good.
Cornbread needs butter and honey.
BBQ has the same problems as Soul Food. It is extremely important on how you make the side dishes. Collard Greens, Mac N' Cheese, yams/candied yams, potato salad or macaroni salad, etc... I wouldn't have just given them the cornbread and mac n' cheese, it has to be made special by an ancient and omniscient Grandma who is only found in the boundary of life and death AND you have to sacrifice your most beloved (pet or person) for Grandma to even fire up the oven and stove. There is cornbread with pineapple in it or sweet corn pieces inside, THAT'S the best cornbread. Not the regular, dry af, mass produced cornbread
Corn bread is really good with honey on it. I don’t like it plain either, and I’m a southerner.
Love the headmaster.  Can you take him to Texas and Tennessee/Kentucky to try foods and bourbon?  But guys, cornbread has to be hot/warm with butter melting in.  Can't just have it cold in the middle of the meal.
When the kid said he never had ribs I cried with Native Texan tears.  It hit my like a seeing an armadillo lying on the road.  Dead.  Sadness.  Now Texas isn't a pork bbq type of place and if anyone tells you yes it is then they're lying to you.  Pork bbq is primarily in Americans of African descent communities but the primary bbq you get, even from some African Americans, is beef.  Now I'm hispanic and my family prefers grilling over actual barbequing.  I will say that if you see a black man making bbq then you are in a good place.  If you see a white man old as the mesquite trees then you're good as well.  If you see some Mexican guy standing in front of a drum bbq pit then you're good as well but Carlitos gonna give you that pollo asado that will make you slap your mama. Asian communities got that sweet glazed bbq ribs ohhh goooood.  Middle easterns got that slow roasted goat hija de su madre.  Texas is a melting pot of love from all different cultures.  Love my Tejas.
Why do they act like they've never seen moisture on protein before? Like is it an English tradition to have arid bangers and sandy mash?
no more boring franks/toast and beans....
EVERY reaction video I watch of BBQ : When you all get to the corn bread, NOBODY eats it correctly! I must have butter and honey!!!! I demand a redo!
Yes, you’ve brought back the British high schoolers trying stuff! ❤😊 ‘Merican food’s the *best*!
the kid that said never make cornbread again. BLASPHEMY
You poor beans on toast. I know what this tastes like just by watching.
Brisket making is basically an art style at this point
I always wondered do you make the food in the UK when you do these segments
1776 and 0.
“You can even put in a bit of slawrrrin there” 😂
They miss to spread some apricot butter  on the cornbread 😋 🤤🤤🤤
Please bring Dave to the Southern US. He will love it! ❤️ Cornbread and Great Northern Beans cooked with ham is divine.
As I always say, Look how these boys are dressed. And look at our schools. Shaneful.
Cornbread needs butter and honey...come on.
I'm curious: How do you get Texas BBQ all the way London? There are some fast food these kids have had I know don't have outlets in London, so how do you get the food there? Who makes it?
This is evil. You are giving them the best food ever made, but they will never again be able to taste it. Like getting a sip of ambrosia in a greek classic. Herion, but there are no dealers. An eternal tastebud prison.
The comedic timing behind "what is this" at the end killed me man
한국어 자막이 없어용
Cornbread without butter and honey is like eating a bread sandwich.  Something is definitely missing.
They got young brad pitt for this its crazy
I want to come to Texas and try their BBQ. As a New Yorker, i feel like I've never had true bbq. Any suggestions?
Jolly pls take the Head Master to America
"i dont think i can eat food here anymore"
No picture on my feed! Just a black screen.
As an American, all of that red meat would be delicious but my body would be in so much pain afterwards. Everything looks delicious.
where is the butter for the corn bread?
This video is making me very hungry.
I love that people are starting to see there are some good things in America. We are pretty good at food and we specialize in having food from everywhere.
Thinking they will never forget that
They must not be used to flavorful food.
Watching these youngsters enjoy that BBQ is one of the times I beam with American pride.
10:35  "we FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON'D OUR TASTEBUDS!?!?"
Kids usually want some honey and butter on the cornbread.  I bet those would change some minds.  Super fun vid to watch.
I love sharing my home states food with others. It always puts a smile on my face
The headmaster has developed a cult following (I think). Get him to the US!
We need a "Headmaster Dave Tours America" series where you guys just abduct Dave and take him through places like New York, Detroit, Chicago, Louisiana, Tennessee, texas, kentucy, california and just make like 2 months worth of videos just experiencing Dave to American cuisine in it's native states
It is hilarious that in Britain it's reflex to put beans on a pc of bread😀
11:09 Ollie loool
BUT I LOVE CORNBREAD
Oh my goodness, I love these kids, they're adorable! 🤗 I could kill a plate of BBQ after watching this.😋
The headmaster is cutie
Whoa! Meat overload!  😅❤
America has been looking for a new state. Just saying UK 😉
After watching adolescence, I needed this. Innocence ❤
Cute kids ❤
Slore in there.
"Please never make corn bread ever again!"....and that was the beginning of what was later referred to as the Second Revolutionary war, ending nearly two and a half centuries of peace and cooperation between the two great nations of America and Great Britain. Many scholars speculate that had it not been for this exact statement, peace would have likely continued until an inevitable further eruption of the great cookie/biscuit conflagration...
Hot water cornbread fried in bacon grease will change your life!
Haha that was funny to watch
You gotta slop a bunch of butter on that cornbread!!!!
If they reacted like this to Texas bbq, their reactions to Korean bbq are going to be something to watch!!!
lol fair enough cornbread is meant to be eaten with beans,chili or somthing like that . also in the south they would usually spread butter on the top if eating it solo just for some moisture and taste.
I don't have beef ribs or the barbecue sausage anymore. You can only eat so much, and for me they just don't make the cut.
학생들과 교장 선생님 먹는 모습은 언제봐도 최고입니다 👍 💝💝👍 늘 재미있고 좋은 영상 맨들어 주셔서 감사드립니다 촬영하시고 편집하시느라 수고 하셨습니다 👍 😊 💕
Headmaster Dave FTW! you need to take him to the crawfish boil !!!!
"You're the funny one"...😂😂😂😂
The food high is so HIGH right now in this video... you can see in in their eyes 🤣🤣🤣
The headmaster just changed his vacation plans to go to Texas.  🤣
The American Civil War was fueled by corn bread, be careful what you say…
Do these guys ever age lol seeing some of the regulars on the channel, they still look like the middle school days😊
After a meal like that, they're not gonna be able to get any schoolwork, nor homework done.  :D
Perfectly smoked rib meat shouldn't just fall off the bone without some assistance. If it does, it's overcooked. People are fooled by this daily.
They must have gotten some terrible cornbread.   It’s supposed to be moist, flavorful and buttery!  Yum!!
wholesome video as always guys, long time fan! but i have to say that im sorry that you need to use an app as Saily to get internet abroad 😀 that is for sure downside to brexit. Meanwile im paying like 20 pounds per month to get unlimited internet in EU 😀
Vegans hate this 😂
i love watching you guys feed people food thats properly seasoned and cooked XD XD and they have a religious experience XD XD
Where did you get the barbecue from?
Which ever American decided to move to the UK and open a BBQ joint would be a millionaire 🤣
We are so blessed to call Texas home.
British high schoolers? The black kids are NOT British. To be British you MUST be white. Just like all of the other European nations and America too.
Never so no to some cornbread, you can offend some Southerners by doing so. It is a social crime to say cornbread is bad in the South, or anywhere in America.
Headmaster can stay at my place anytime here in New Braunfels, TX!!! Dude is the best!
don't eat cornbread without butter.
Please contact fellow Brit L3WG and collaborate on a American adventure!  He would love it!
Sometimes I wonder at the discipline required to keep being a vegan while watching videos like this.
You need to go to Nick Tahou in Rochester NY for a garbage plate.
As a Texan, I need to know what BBQ joint this is from in TX.. love the videos!
As a Texan myself, I have to agree that corn bread is not forever , it really is best fresh out the oven, if it sits out too long than it doesn’t really taste good in my opinion
I live in Texas, I eat BBQ almost every other day.
British have to try every foods in the world cause their food is...
Should have told him that there's at least three other styles of barbecue they need to try.  That would have blown their brains open. Lol
Most British food is very bland
Love how this comes in my feed when I’m literally in Texas
It gets better boys, that's a lean brisket, makes me smile to see the boys loving the food
Hahahah I'm laughing they all immediately put the beans on "toast"
Ah the taste of freedom.
The headmaster has the same realtionship with tea that I do with cocaine
Texas bbq is the best. Don't even need sauce when done right 😋
Damn what y'all be eating over there in Europe if there's no BBQ lol
No one actually from Texas calls it a Texas fold, just that pretentious guy from California Josh Weissman does.
Butter the cornbread!
Did they show a whole brisket for every group???
Sorry Buddy, as a USA Citizen I recommend NO international visitors for at least 3 1/2 years. I don't even want to be here!
I’m soooo jealous of these young men.  Everything looks great.
Harry is a little foodieeee. So adorable! ❤ love from Texas. Happy they like it for the most part lol
The only things missing are wet kitchen towels to wipe their hands on. And a bag of pork cracklins.
Josh & Ollie got to come to Canada & try classic favourite of poutine, Nanamio bars, pea soup, other favourites that represent Canada.
This guy's remind me of Eduardo Videgaray and Estaca from la Cornett radio show.
I love my state and food like our BBQ is one of those things that I can truly be proud of about Texas. There’s a lot that makes me ashamed of my state, but our food and our hospitality are points of pride for me.
"It's better than sewage water." The kid is my new Food Critic hero.
The boy saying pickles are like cucumbers but better ….. ummm tell him pickles ARE smaller cucumbers which have been pickled in a brine.  Loved the face expression when the other boy got super excited when he was told they had pickles ….. lol 🥒
CCs are out of sync
Cornbread really is an acquired taste. Also it has to be made by the right person. The saying goes in America “I don’t eat just anybody’s cornbread”
"The pickles ruin it". Smart kid
Some of my bbq favorites I wish they had tried also - creamed corn which is sweet but it works  - peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream on top - pulled pork bbq sandwich - smoked turkey breast I feel has its place  But my all time favorite is a 3 meat sandwich that's on a hamburger bun it has Sliced brisket , Pulled pork AND sausage (it's a little much lol)
I swear they be lying bout the ages of some of the kids on this show 😂
I absolutely adore all of these young men and their headmaster is a gem! I am so glad they are enjoying some of the different foods and flavors we Americans are so fond of. Bravo Josh and Ollie. Bravo!
Why does Harry look like the live version of Goob from Meet the robinson
The two blonde boys who kept complaining about the food 😅😅😅
9 años párese que tiene 21 Alv
I wish this headmaster and boys with jolly do a week visit to the USA and especially Texas. That would make a fantastic video and it would be fun to watch these boys see just how big Texas is and all the bigger than life things. The biscuits and gravy breakfast
I understand the kids not liking cornbread. I didn’t like cornbread as a kid. I didn’t even like corn dogs. I liked hot dogs fine so it was definitely the batter.
Why do I think every one of these kids will be smuggling themselves to Texas for their gap year.
As someone who has had terrys black, and plenty of other spots of texas BBQ. I live in southern texas and i’ll be damned I will never EVER get tired of southern BBQ or texas BBQ
Teenage boys growth spurts never fails to shock me. I cant believe how much monty and freddie(are they twins?) grow in one year😂 they looks like 5 years older than prev clip
no banana pudding???
them kids rethinking ordering again hahahaha
I don't like the bread crumbs on the mac and cheese either. It makes the mac and cheese feel gritty in my mouth.
I swear, I saw the headmaster have an out of body experience and I am living for it!!
To my Brit mates in this vids aka the kidz... DON'T go to the States!!
I love their reactions to the barbecue. It is amazing. This tells me some Texan should go to the UK and open a shop.
THE BOYS ARE BACK!!!!! WE MISSED YOU KIDS!!!
Corn bread is so polarizing😂😂
there's no difference between english tea and hot water.
Cornbread is better when it’s hot with butter
Gentlemen,  southern corn bread is best served very warm.  Cut add a bit of butter and drizzled with honey.  Try it this way. Hopefully, you'll like it better than plain and cold.
Bro was HUNGRY 1:25
How does one live, with out pickles 😂
You guys gave Texas Barbeque to the Highschoolers before BUVNA??? XD
Where are the sarcastic funny lads?  Theo and Lorenzo are missed here! 😢😅
BUTTER AND OR HONEY GOES ON CORNBREAD...
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Bring the headmaster to the United States!!!! PLEASE!!!!  THAT WLD BE THE BEST VIDEO!
Need to know where you got the bbq Also y'all need to bring this headmaster on a trip to Texas with you
"im all for the ride" love it!
come for the BBQ, stay for the freedom!
That's why we use the cornbread to sop up the juices on the plate.
Why do i always smile when British kids say, “thats nice!”
I am a high school teacher, and if we did this, every other word would be bro and fire. These boys are so kind (even when they don't like the food), respectful, and hilarious! You can tell these boys are getting a great education that allows their personalities to shine through, hence the headmaster.
Who made that cornbread? It can be the star of the show if you make it right.
The captions at around 4:50 said "and the inside is boujee
😅😂 love it
Amen to no bread crumbs on macaroni
The cornbred must have butter and  honey
Wait, did he just say that their regular mac n cheese is runny?
These kids are adorable and the head teacher seems like he’d be so much fun
As who lives in Texas I can confirm that the corn bread doesn’t taste good with barbecue
Thick cornbread, almost looks like northern cornbread (with wheat flour).  Southern cornbread should be thin, moist, cornmeal only (often white cornmeal), and quite moist.
that was awesome to watch haha
love your videos, but there is no way some of these kids never had or even heard of some of the foods on this channel. what do you guys even eat over there
"I've had bread."  Nothing has changed in England since Charles Dickens.
Missed opportunity for some bbq sauce, sausage and pork rib meat in the Mac and cheese
No one just eats plain cornbread. It needs to be slathered in melted butter and honey.
Yea welcome to flavor you red coats.
WTH is up with the captions? Lol.  Now you know the American weight issue lol.
See, You ARE the guys that make those videos with young boys!
I'm a Canadian...and in 1980 at 13 years old I moved to Texas. Texas BBQ blew our minds... bbq for us was burgers, dogs or maybe steak on a charcoal bbq. Smoked BBQ is the best.
Teenagers.... they each get an enormous tray of food... and one good inhale, and it's all gone, LOL.   I love seeing foreigners introduced to "American Food" that's not what they think "American Food" is going to be!
As a mum, all i can think of is the meat grease on their uniforms! 😂😂😂
No one calls it a Texas fold you frickin nerds
I love cornbread, these kids are not right in the head. 😅 And i could taste the beans through the tv screen!!
Whole school about to relocate
Listen kid, you don't know crap if you are telling us to STOP making cornbread. I know I know, but I take heart in my native and cultural cuisine (southern food) so don't go disrespecting my food when you eat beans on toast and call that a meal.
Seeing Ollie wearing that shirt from my favorite mountain to snowboard on always makes me cry. Yes, it's in California and it's amazing. Also, Headmaster Dave is back!
Yesss
So why are Britt’s still eating 17th century food this day and age anyway? You kids don’t have to grow up on bread and beans it’s not hard to bbq a piece of meat
Here’s an idea for the next one - Have them good ole Tortilla Soup- Changed my life when I first tried it ❤
Headmaster summer vlog take this man to America
3:06 "Like your eating a pillow or something" 😂😂
I love watching these videos. Born and raised in the US but still have never had real texas BBQ.
They've become Americans when he said stop making cornbread 🤣🤣 only an American can have the best time of their lives and still find a complaint. Love these videos
cant look at this vid because thse kids look like those dad that put bananas over their heads and its so accurate
headmaster is going to cancel his holiday to portugal and head straight to texas.
The British experiencing flavor will always be entertaining!! 😅
World’s Best Headmaster!
I can't wait for the next generation of high schoolers first Korean trip at the end of the year series to happen again.
The Headmaster's reactions are  like if he was getting head from a master ....
12:09  British kid: "It's a rat" American: "I can assure you, sir, that is a bean" British Kid: "Nah, a mean, it's a rat, a quart lark it, innit"
🤗
I firmly believe that if someone went to England and opened up a Barbecue joint, and served pecan pie for dessert, they'd make a mint.
The captions got messed up because the ad in the middle 💔
"I don't think I can eat food here, anymore!" 🤣🤣🤣
Cornbread needs to be hot and soaked with loads of butter
Love watching their expressions .
No wonder they didn't like the cornbread, you gave them dry cornbread. Cornbread just cries out for butter, lots of butter.
The best cornbread has creamed corn added in place of a portion of the milk. Makes it softer and sweeter, with the bonus of actual corn in the finished product.
I always get excited  when the  high school  kids start but now I won't  watch another unfollow jolly
13:42 there are better options to get cornbread and it's best to make it fresh not let it get cold
calling texas "southern" makes my ears burn
Someone needs to explain Meat Sweats cause those poor boys are probably going to get a bad case.
Clearly they didn’t have good cornbread.
When that cute little guy said "well it's lovely" just melted me into a puddle of BBQ sauce 🥹
What I’d like to know is how do they bring the American food to UK? Reheating the meat cooks it more and looking up import laws you can’t bring in beef from US to UK. Also the other vids have Taco Bell so that food would be sort of stale even with reheating. Anyway just curious on the behind the scenes
Proud to be a Texan and proud of our BBQ🫡
In the country of Texas the word "Too" is not used ahead of the word "Cheesy"
8:24 wdym Ollie that's one of the greatest anologies a British kid has ever uttered!
+10 points for the Mammoth Mountain shirt 🎉🎉🎉
You guys should go to Tom Holland and have him experience what you do because he says British food is better than American food. Look it up he's actually on camera saying it
Now, imagine living in Texas, where you get this stuff all over the place, any time you want. When the lads graduate from high school they might want to look into out of country tuition rates for A&M, Baylor, Texas, Texas Tech, U of H, Sam Houston, etc.!
Cornbread requires copious amounts of butter and, optionally, honey. For the love... eating it dry?!?
You forgot desert: pecan pie or banana pudding, or maybe peach cobbler.
I think I need to know how they're getting this BBQ.  Did it get shipped?  Did someone in the UK try their best?
Ive watched these kids grow up lol
A few of the younger kids look a lot like former students on the channel, wonder if they're the little brothers or just coincidental.
i so enjoy the vocabulary of the British.
For the record all Texas barbecue is not like this.
Poor kid. I hope that he realizes that cornbread tastes different depending on who makes it/how it is made. I have tasted some very bland dry cornbread in my day as well as very moist....ooo those guys should have tried fried corn bread🤤. Now that's some slap ya mama good stuff😁
of course, beans on toast 😂
This new Generation of Jolly Gentlemen and the Headmaster needs to try some Mexican food!!
Two (maybe 4) ways to make cornbread. If you can taste sugar in it: Yuck! No sugar: Yum! You can use yellow cornmeal OR white cornmeal.
I love how they're British so of course their first instinct seeing beans is to put them on bread.
I'm soooo tired of people misusing the word "crescendo" (0:20).  The word "crescendo" is a musical term (Italian) that means "a gradual increase in volume," not a pinnacle, or climax as used here.  Please, I beg of you, use the words that you know.  Don't try to impress us by misusing the words that you don't know.
that one kid looks like a young freddie mercury
Congratulations boys! I can’t eat barbecue white a jacket and tie.
Ya'll forgot the butter on the cornbread.
"Why are Americans so overweight?"  Mystery solved.
Just imagine if the kids went cross country trying all the food stops jolly tried
yall made these boys lives complete. theres americans who havent even been able to experience a meal like this
These boys getting meat sweats for sure
don't ever usung audio track again ma dud, it's trash ass, subtitle is already fine
1:22 to 1:31 the kid on the left is straight out of a movie
these videos never get old man i love it. should show them all the different kinds of bbqs. theres texas bbq, memphis bbq, carolina bbq, i think even chicago bbq. all different
The one kid that gets cornbread can come to America, the rest can not.
Somebody's getting cancelled in Dixieland because of that damn cornbread...
The Headmaster seems like an easy guy to please, he loved everything.
This is kinda cruel in a way. Those boys are now ruined forever. They've acquired a flavor benchmark that can rarely be topped.
Not the cornbread I wanted to represent all corn breads, but it could of definitely been worse.
These kids are so spoiled. Going back to the day in and day out UK food has to be a let down.  :)
You've tried 3 of the 4 US barbeque capitals.  You should visit Kansas City (an original cow town) originator of burnt ends.  You could come during the World Series of Barbeque.  Last year there were 11 countries represented.  Come a week earlier to see the American Royal livestock show and maybe catch a local sporting event, KC Current or Chiefs.  Kansas produces one quarter of the beef eaten in the US.
I bet the kids would enjoy our seafood here on the Florida Gulf Coast.
i been watching these gentlemen for the past 3 years and i just realized where the name Jolly comes from LMAO
Cornbread is not dry icky! They just did not make it right! It gets rehydrated must mean they were dry. Cornbread is not supposed to be dry. Add an egg. Or mike or buttermilk!
This video was honestly elite ❤
The disrespect on cornbread 😢
Texan here. "The crescendo" is exactly how i want my states pride and joy to be described as. Thank you. Thank you. We are awesome. We know, we're just happy to share. Please enjoy and i can teach you how if you want.
Those are not traditional Texas pinto beans.
"The cornbread is like really bland.. its like eating paper" That isn't what you're used to? 💀
David came here to eattt😂
Where was this cooked at? Obviously it wasn’t in the states, and that’s totally fine. Just curious to learn where I can get some good BBQ when I’m over there, which is usually a couple times/month.
You need good butter on corn bread for flavor and moisture.
the boys get home then tell their parents then jealousy ensues.
You guys are spoiling these boys. Lucky Kids. Btw, honey butter, or strawberry jam and butter, goes a long way to make cornbread less dry.
You should take the boys and the headmaster to Texas. And to Buc-ees.
I love how Josh and Ollie gleefully look on as they guide the uninitiated through the wonders of Texas barbecue.....
I never fail to smile every time I watch someone as they try BBQ for the first time..
Aint no way the kid in the bottom right of the thumbnail is in highschool. He'll get made fun of more than Jack Doherty
God Bless those kids and god Bless America and the UK (and the rest of the world)
It's funny to me they put the black kids together
"I don't think I can even eat food here anymore." LOL That kid is great.
Texas isn't southern or western, Texas is Texas 🇺🇲
Put butter on cornbread
Are cornbread is serve  hot with a little bit of melted butter on top
😂😂😂👍
I'm so glad they started with the burnt ends. Those cuts have so much damn flavor.
I have to say, the Headmaster is one of my favorite people on this series, He's so chill and always appreciative of all the food and experience.  Always has something funny to say!❤
Always make sure to carve 3 hours out afterwards to be comatose 😂
The younger students seemed more open to the cornbread and mac’n cheese. Interesting.
I will forever love the "British High Schoolers" segment ❤❤❤
These are just about the most wholesome, genuine teens on the internet. Please don't ruin them!
love seeing new faces try the food and ive had my favorites throughout the years, but my all time favorite is the principal. please have him in every video. his reactions are the best.
Cornbread: You need to put some softened butter on the top right before you eat it
If all you need is 1 paper towel to go back to class,  that's not even New York bbq.  Whoever sold you that is a cook.  Not a pit master.
Now I want BBQ.
The international scene used to make fun of American cuisine. But I think more and more the world is truly appreciating the gift that BBQ and hamburgers are to the world.
Lol they’re ALL WANTING TO COME TO AMERICA LOL BRING THEM TO TEXAS 😂
You need to butter the corn bread.  It's like adding salt, it enhances the flavor.
1:18 is that fuckin Brad Pitt? LOL
That cornbread looks DRY, everything else looked good
A lot of men in America take immense delight in spending the whole day smoking meat.  We do it as a social event, often drinking beer we've brewed, grinding sausage from stuff we've hunted - oh and yeah we're the kind of guys who really do enjoy firearms just for the fun of them, and there's I think 15 firearms per adult man in the US.  Because of all the time spent smoking meat, making beer, making sausage, and shooting firearms, we tend to be exceptionally good at these skills, and have lots of fun in life!    Having watched this video, I think I am going to go make a supper of my favorite that is shown here: some smoked beef sausage!  Have fun, lads, and come visit the States.  We enjoy life here.  :)
Poor kids never ain’t had no seazzznings
How are they getting this stuff in England for these
the huge raisin kid xD
Texas born and raised...you gotta put some butter on that cornbread!
one of the blonde kids looks like brad pitt in fight club
I haven’t even finished the into and I’m laughing out loud.  This is gonna be good!!
In a time where my country is acting like a disgrace it’s nice to watch something where America is getting positive press lol😂
12:03 they had to put it on the toast
That cornbread needs to be served with some honey butter
Love the Mammoth Mountain shirt. California represent. Even though I’ve never been. More of a mountain high or Bear mountain guy, but California nonetheless!
제목한글로 쓸거면 한국어 자막도 달아놓거라
Headmaster NEEDS a trip to America. He deserves it so much!! ❤
Hey, that watering eye kid looks like the Villain kid from “Meet The Robinsons” 😂
This is a transcendental experience for these kids. Experiencing flavor is bringing them to a higher plane of understanding
Next is pizza from domino's to Detroit
I dont think britain even has anything other than black pepper and salt let alone a texas rub. Are they like flying out a pit master and handing him a smoker. wheres this food coming from
Your welcome!!!
The boys were not ready for the beans.
take away the cutlery😭😭
If someone from another country were to ask me what an iconic American dish was, I would say southern BBQ 100%. There's nothing like it anywhere else in the world.
We American's in the comments are really requesting headmaster USA tour.
Does my southern belle heart good to see those young men enjoying themselves so much. Good on ya, kiddos❤
Is Mr. Smith sure he wants to go to Portugal and not Texas for vacation?
Whenever y’all decide to retire, I hope you pass the channel reigns to a couple of these kids hahaha
The captioning was off. Very off. Get your money back on that one.
Brits put butter on everything but they refuse to put it on corn bread smh
You Britt's need more culture  !!!
I actually love the kids’ analogy, much more sense!❤❤❤❤
Your subtitles are fucked because you stuck your ad in the middle.
Blacks aren’t British they are African. Papers and documents don’t change your race or blood. Once a non white always a non white no matter what any piece of paper says.
you need to have them try corn bread again, but this time with a bowl of chili (Texas Red to be specific)
British moment: Sees beans, puts on toast immediately.
Just love watching these kiddos enjoy the food! Their reactions are great! Makes me happy!
Cornbread is a gift from God
where did they get the bbq in england?
Absolutely LOVE these videos!  I live in the American South and you have truly hit on many of our unique and special foods.  I will say that cornbread definitely needs honey and butter depending on the recipe, but all the British beans on toast I've ever had frankly tasted like what we feed to prisoners.  Keep up the excellent work!
I bet best one they did❤  life change after that lol
Love the Mammoth tee Ollie
They dont have pickles in the UK???
WHY is British cuisine so BLAND??  Even the monarchy prefers French vs British cuisine.
It’s our beef industry is what’s made these dishes so common ”thank god”. Our history is long when it comes to BBQ with contributions from Natives,Jewish,Spanish,German,Mexican,African,and many more. All these methods and techniques make for awesome food NO HOUSE HOLD IS THE SAME!!!❤❤ I once ate a meatball made of 5 different game animals with cheese stuffed pepper in the middle. I just.. I can’t…. Tell y’all …..how great it really is.
Y'know what, it's payday, it's Friday, I'm going to get BBQ.
It’s ok, boys, sweet tea sucks!!! And I’m from the American South. Lol
Can someone show this to Tom Holland since he thinks English food is better than food from the US.
Now y’all know why Americans get a little chunky. 😂❤  Loved pomp and circumstance being played while they were eating the ribs. MERICA!
HAHAHA One of the BEST!  Their reactions to US food is so much fun!  "That's Lovely" is a blast!  Have they ever had corn on the cob???
I've watched all of these and this one brings such joy to me seeing them enjoy everything so much. ❤
I kinda like a crouton 🤔
Southern American here.  Even I don't get really good BBQ but maybe once a year or two, so the kids got a nice treat as far as I'm concerned.  It all looked SOO SO good, minus maybe the beans and corn bread, I'm not a fan of those.  Corn bread is always dry and crumbly.  Almost inedible unless you put some butter on it or dip it in something, so dry.  The meats all looked absolutely to-die-for though.  Those huge beef ribs with the meat falling off the bone.  AH, hungry now!
I love watching them love this!!!
Would def party with the Headmaster.  Hopefully he’s a Chelsea fan.😅
"Are you lying?..... (*eats brisket)..... He's not lying"
The headmaster 😂😂😂
They all have the meat sweats! 🤣
Rename these videos to british kids try foods that make them realize why their country sucks
Jalapeño cheese corn bread quit cutting corners mayne😤
If you follow this group. I think Harry is going to be the standout.
British high schoolers experience flavor and seasoning for the first time.
Great sell with the fatty bits, talk them into it
It would've been better to send them some hushpuppies instead of corn bread they would've like them better hot with butter. That bbq looked delicious. 😋👍🏾
The kids are always paired but the headmaster needs a partner.  Also bring the headmaster to the USA!!!
Who has someone eat unbuttered cornbread?!  You monsters!
Get the principal off the show please
Kids their age never having ribs is child abuse!
I used to work at Bodean's in London and that was the first time i saw the giant ribs.   I am from America but have never been to Texas so we only do babyback ribs and stuff .
Not the Champions League theme song!  lol
Broo the kid looked at the camera, straight face and all " Please never make cornbread again!" LMFAOOOOO NAHH SAVAGE😂😂😂
I think they need a field trip to Texas!
its so funny watching Brits taste actual soul and flavor filled food :) totally not biased because I'm a Texan ;) But you can totally tell who is getting the so-called meat sweats
Went to smash the like button, realized I hit it 7 minutes ago…. pissed I can’t like it’s twice or 8 times. Sure I’m not alone.
Love this and tell me I’m wrong but Mack looks like Brad Pitt from fight club era
Only thing missing was some peach cobbler for dessert. 🤤
Mr Smith is looking fine 😉
got to serve cornbread with sides of butter and/or honey
Those pork ribs look questionable
Cornbread with some cinnamon butter.
This is great! I can’t believe they don’t like cornbread 🤷🏼‍♀️
7:07 the graduation song😂😂😂
Cornbread needs more butter. Other than that, these kids are one step closer to being honorary Texans. I'm glad they enjoyed our food. There's plenty more to try.
I eat cornbread like a rabid dog that's found the one human not in a lake. love from Texas
I have to praise your consistence in finding the very best foods in the US and sharing them with the world. Wish I could eat like this every day 😅
As an American this makes me smile and appreciate my country even more. We're awesome
Private schools are superior to public schools. This video proves it. Thanks 👍
Yet again, the reason Americans are fat. We love our food.
The pain in Ollie’s eyes when the one kid said he didn’t like the crusty bit of the Mac and cheese. 😂
Now this is just wholesome man i hope they keep getting more food enjoyment because thats just so sweet lol
Commenting every day until Jolly sponsors a Mr. Smith Does America series.
Always look forward to these🎉. So good!! Dieing 😂. Thanks for the TV!!
For cornbread, you need to add butter and honey to get the full experience
First, that cornbread was too dry and crumbly.  Second, they need to try it with butter or in milk!
Shhhh my favorite show is on
British highschoolers try real food for the first time
Naw, the young man that said never do cornbread again is certainly valid. Cornbread is hit or miss for some folks, I'd never eat cornbread by itself. I put red beans and rice, stews, soups, etc over it. Or slice it and make it like a sandwich and vasts amount of butter lol. Appreciate y'all showing off Texas BBQ.
Is it just me or does that one kid resemble Brad Pitt?
Who in the hell teaches these kids how to eat?
Currently sitting in Dallas with a cup of sweet tea watching this. 😂
Is this all from Red Dog? It looks amazing. What a joy to watch the boys enjoying proper barbecue. And always a treat to se Mr. Smith absolutely living for it. I agree with everyone here who wants you all to bring him to America at the summer holiday one year.
I am digging Ollie in an apron.
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah put the fork and knives down boys!
I'm cracking up when you gave the boys the BBQ beans they straight away plopped them on bread! Hilarious! No one here in the US would have ever gone there. We never eat beans on toat. So British.😍
These kids are adorable.
From Oklahoma we have the best BBQ.  But that looks delicious.  🤤
Bad cornbread is terrible. From the description of "dry" i tend to think that's what they tried. A good piece of buttered moist cornbread with actual corn in it is fantastic.
That brisket dry af
Kid said he cant eat brittish food anymore after this LOL great
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore"😅😅😂
How do they get the food there? They fly with it in checked luggage? 🤣🤣🤣
Texan here, warms my heart to see these young gents enjoying Texas food. 🇨🇱🇨🇱🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
You should come to Arkansas and try Fat Daddy's BBQ
Why did you give them cornbread without butter or honey?
“That’s lovely.” lol! I’ve never heard Texas BBQ described thus, but it’s lovely😄
This is child abuse… their taste buds are forever spoiled. How can you expect them to go back to British food ?!?!
2:43 when she doesn't stop after you bust.
They need more butter on that cornbread...or red beans to dip it in!
the twins got me 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Just slow cooked a brisket 2 days ago for 12 hours started right at 5 and gotten finished closed to 6, Briket is one of the best Meats ever to be created, I get one every holiday, but seeing these kids eating it makes me so happy😂
Why have they never tried Kansas City BBQ lol, i dont get it when KC is way better then Texas BBQ
These young men are so well-spoken and adorable! 😊
You really brought Texas BBQ to The British Schoolkids!!! NOOOO WAYY 😂😂
So where can I find this American food in London?
How does he get the food there?
We'll stop making cornbread when you stop eating beans on toast.
Why aren’t there any women high schoolers?
So no girl high schoolers?
Harry is the best 😂 he's just enjoying every little bit as his eyes bulge bugger with every new bite lol
Boom!  Murrica...
As a American this made me Happy 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 no forks 100% need to try a little butter and honey on the cornbread
It is great to have good friend like Josh and Olie.   Headmaster and all kids are so funny. All their response and comments make me smile to ears. Picking up the ribs they look all neanthedral right there. The mop analagy does makes sense
Next time you all are in the states you should have Kent Rollins cook you up something.
Please look into the subtitles. They are messed up.
AMERICA!!
13:32 - i only drink iced sweet tea or just sweet tea cause its like 98°F or 37°C
Y’all had the wrong cornbread baker for this video	…..
Should do a video of them getting the itis for the first time, directly after. 😂
*Sees beans* Immediately slather them on bread 😂
Live in California and we don't have anything like this! A few have tried but not even close. Have to plan a trip to Texas just for the BBQ. Loved the kids responses.
Gotta put butter and honey on it!
Corn bread tastes better warm with butter.
Why are the students segregated?  And why does the headmaster eat alone?
The Headmaster is the absolute best!!! Come to Florida god sir, we have awesome BBQ!
If you can't bring Headmaster Dave to Texas Barbecue, bring the Texas Barbecue to Headmaster Dave
First thing British kids do when they get good baked beans, put them on bread...
we may not live long, but god damn it if it aint worth it
They are so Cute
You need to make sure the cornbread has butter and honey next time! It's not meant to be plane... Or crumble it in the chili...
Damn, now I’m hungry 🤤
The amount of flavor you disposed upon these kids should be considered biological warfare
As an American, I never understood cornbread until I had jalapeño cheddar cornbread. Thank you, England, and Mexico for getting married via one of the blandest and texturally harshest bread mediums to make something actually incredible!
Someone needs to send you some Johnny Cake style Cornbread.  It's a sweet cornbread and the Jiffy mix plant that makes it is located in Michigan not too far from Detroit, maybe an hour?
“Are you lying?.. you’re not lying..”
I was looking for my favorite kids from previous videos. All new ones and it took me a minute to realize they've grown and graduated by now. Wow how time flies. Congratulations  on your continuing success. ❤ you guys. 😊
After they are all done eating they will all need to take a nap.
"Please never make cornbread again"  GET THEE BEHIND ME, SATAN!
Headmaster is a real one!!!!! Howdy from Texas y'all 🤠🤠🤠
I don't know whose reactions I love to watch more, the kids or the Headmaster.   These videos are my favorites.
Exposing British people to food with this much flavor is almost a war crime.
Why does one of the kids look like goob from meet the Robinsons?
The head master should open up a pit house!
Man, I love this channel.
Love BBQ! Brisket and burnt ends are 💙💙💙💙!!!
It’s all about the bark!!! OMGOSH! The RIBS😍!!!
I just wonder how you guys get this food through customs at the airport to get it overseas.
Josh, pls no vids when ur ovulating.  The cackling and falsetto voice are making my ears bleed
Would love yall to bring some of them to the US but I doubt they’re parents would even let them at the current moment
Nice to see the Headmaster again.
63 year old native Texan here. STOP with the "Texas fold" garbage. I've literally never heard that until that hipster on your YouTube video said it.  IT'S NOT A THING!
Lil dude said I don't think I'll ever be able to eat the food here again. :)
Im curious how they get American food to these kids, is it the bring frozen barbecue from America, or do they have a private chef make it in England?
Yeeeaaah booooy that American bbq be hittin
Barbeque is almost a religious experience. BTW, that's just Texas. You can go Carolina, Nashville, Hickory-smoked.
OH  you all need to try 2 chocolate mints with a dill pickle in the center. OH !
Well, if you don't make your cornbread with buttermilk then... it just isn't cornbread!!
The teacher loves everything lol
Do British people not use cutlery?
jeeze get to KC already.....
Love the funny, charming, authentic reactions (of course, referring to the headmaster ❤)
Does British Law permit exposing underaged boys to TX BBQ?  They'll run away and join the rodeo.😮
The older... I think he may be older. He has the "butch" haircut and he's bigger than the other students. To me, he resembles a young Brad Pitt. The really dark haired young man with the super thick wavy hair. He KNOWS HIS FOOD! He's a foodie at heart! He GETS what the cornbread is supposed to do with the barbecued meats. I've had a lot of these barbecues and I love corn. It doesn't love me. I'm allergic to it, however, the flavor, the texture... I love corn. Grits, shrimp and grits. It's fantastic, but I didn't know what it did for barbecue. Butter on cornbread, I've died and gone to heaven. Butter in grits(my mother puts jalapenos in some of her cornbread!). Same with popped corn for me. Add salt, pepper and butter and pop it in a special soy butter flavored oil(I suppose I can make my special popping oil), pure heaven! ❤ But, THAT young man... I think he can become a reviewer, a chef, a cook, he innately KNOWS WHAT THE EXTRAS DO besides tastes. He's smart. He's not just thinking with his tastebuds, but with his whole mouth, his brain, his salivary glands, EVERYTHING! He's one in a million! WAY TO GO CULINARY GENIUS!!! 👍💖😉 The young men are really sweet and cute. They didn't have to like everything, however, the barbecue meat was a HUMONGOUS hit all the way around and back again!❤ The secret is long time smoking. I saw a man from England who had a smallish smoker in his back yard. It was the size of a kitchen cabinet. Now, there is controversy of gas verses charcoal or wood. Personally I think charcoal/wood tastes better, however it is more carcinogenic laiden. But! You only live once... or don't eat smoked or red meat often in general. I haven't heard that public survey much in the last 10 or so years. THANK HEAVEN. I may look into getting a small smoker if it's VERY EASY to use and ti hook up. Love smoked meats and barbecue. We can't have FLAMED burners on our stoves any longer. Something about the environment. Oh, I love scratched up stove tops that are flat, NOT!!! Miss those flamed burners, HATE FLAT TOP STOVES WITH A FREAKIN PASSION!!! GET THEM AWAY FROM ME, DASTARDLY THINGS! But, yes, come to the U.S. of A.!!! There's more things that are barbecued that you(s) just might like. I think there is barbecued mac n' cheese even! I'm not much of a mac n' cheese and there are many varieties. You'd be very, very surprised! All are welcome and hope you enjoy eating your way through America!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤. This was a wonderful pleasure. 😉 Thank you all! ❤
Where’s the butter on warm cornbread ? Brits just don’t get it ! Like tacos without sauce or salsa !!
"Yes, I've had this bread."Best line ever.
8:09 must be a nasty cornbread recipe!  Done right, it’s divine!
3:38 Their reactions to pickles 🤣
Beef sausage and hot dogs aren't necessary the most common in America.  I mostly have the standard mixed meat chicken, turkey, and pork.
I love the pickle twins, their energy is contagious
I seriously wanna know how you brought that to the UK 👀
We have two YouTube nitwits showing up today to force kids to eat some gross American food. You and you have been selected. NO! Why me? This is stupid. That thing looks like a big raisin. (takes a bite) This is what food tastes like? OK I'm moving to America now.
ribth 😂
Miss the old high-school guys literally i was there from the day 1  It doesn't feel the same when i watch the new highschooler i just get sad cz i was so connected with the old highschool team i wish u make them reunite please
Always such a good time.
I agree! Let’s ban cornbread! I was born and raised in the South and I loathe cornbread.
4:17 I'm from Texas and have never heard the phrase "Texas fold."
Tell Mr. Negative there to piss off!! Corn bread is the best!! He just does not know what is good for him.
I cant eat here anymore.  Bless his heart for real! (NOT mean)
As a Texan, I never get tired of seeing British people eating Texas BBQ for the first time. BTW, cornbread is much better in a bowl with Texas chili (yes I spelled it correctly) on top... or with some honey butter. Just by itself, it is a bit dry.
To see the appreciation of our Texas bbq makes me happy!. Growing up in Texas it’s very hard to eat bbq anywhere else.
You don’t squeeze all the juice out before you eat it. Lol
I... I forgot what 9 year olds looked like. maybe it's the uniform... but i was like oh teenagers...
I have to agree, that corn bread looked dry and not of the best quality Corn Bread.
Love our bbq here in Texas❤❤
They need paper napkisn and sauce3!!!
Here's one to blow your minds; there are several types and methods to make cornbread.  I've seen you try the yellow "cake". cornbread but there are also white cornbread, more savory but a gritty texture cooked similarly to a Yorkshire pudding, hot water cornbread that is similar to a dumpling, and even cornbread pancakes that are AMAZING with BBQ. There's a racial divide in who prefers what but while I'm white I prefer the black/African American styles.
Yo, that one kid that looks like young Brad Pitt is at least 30
Lol. Their tastebuds are ruined for seasoned food now 😂
These are always my favorite Jolly videos!
I agree with many others asking to bring the headmaster to America.  He's honest, funny, and has excellent taste!
Definitely not Jiffy cornbread mix. Have to try it next time you come to the states. It’s made in the state of Michigan so it’s kinda a more northern thing not so much in the south
i love seeing brits become american patriots for like 14 minutes like I genuinely feel bad but proud lol
Cornbread is only good with a lot of butter on it, or a lot of honey butter on it.
You need to take them all on a BBQ tour of America.
When are you going to have female highschoolers do this?
Really bland??? Bro y’all definitely did not prepare that cornbread correctly nor did y’all butter it. If a Brit is saying something’s bland y’all definitely dropped the ball on that cornbread
♥CORNBREAD now and FOREVER ! 😋
Welcome to the greatest thing ever, kids! ... Well, greatest thing since Jesus, anyway.  I guess the British term for cornbread can be 'mop cake.' =)  Were there jalapenos in the beans?  'sposed to have jalapenos in those beans, guys.  If not, they're missing out.
the captions picking up the camera crew talking in the back LMFAO
Cornbread is bad - the only way it's edible is to slather it with butter or crumble it up into your chili.
Cornbread looked too dry and crumbly. Needs to be fresh and warm with a little butter
Native Texan, here. 'Texas fold' is not a thing in Texas, in case anyone is wondering. That's just a brisket sandwich.
@12:00 You picked the least british kid for this
“The bark is the best part” *chefs kiss* excellent vernacular 🤣
I used Saily in the Philippines.. is was bloody useless
did oli cook it all everytime they hate something his face seems like a 4star chef hearing the food is just ok
Seeing them just bite the pork ribs on the edge hurt my lil heart
Why aren't they using eating utensils
love saily
1:32, where are your glasses and the lightning bolt-shaped scar, Harry? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a Texan, this makes my heart happy. Now I’m finna buy myself some brisket. 😂
I can't imagine baked beans on bread. Must taste like paste. Eat it by it self. As for cutting ribs. It is super common to cut each one separately unlike the place in Memphis. Still eat them with your fingers.
Should get Gus's chicken for them too
Guys, you took the first group of school kids to KOREA.... can't you please bring Headmaster Dave HERE to the USA ????????????????
Texas BBQ is not the same as Southern whole hog BBQ.
Why did all the boys pore the beans onto the bread? You're just supposed to eat it with your utensils 😮
“Oh, you’re the funny one” just perfectly sums up Ollie’s entire existence on this channel.
i mean, it's not cooked. and you guys are spreading america's obesity
Corn bread needs butter or honey
I will add my voice to the request that you bring the Headmaster to America!!!!! You should take him on the tour of Southern cuisine like you both had.😀❤ I bet if you put it out there, people would host you all.
Love these kids and, of course, the headmaster. One boy to the other, "Have you eaten in a week?"
Growing up in Texas we called corn bread Yella (Yellow) Cake.
13:50 you gotta load up that cornbread with butter
I'm not a cornbread fan tho *an American
Those lads are all absolute legends and their headmaster soooo rocks.
13:41 I think this kid needs detention.
5:19 are they sending me to 🇵🇹? I'm so excited!
Cornbread needs to be slathered with butter.
Sad no southern banana pudding to end the meal
Bring Headmaster Dave to the US!
4:08 this is like when we prepared all of the fixins for tacos for my grandma for the first time in the early 90s. We told her to put whatever she wanted on her tortilla. She did. Then she looked over at us with a temple of fixins on her tortilla and asked, "Okay, now what?" 😂
boy with hand brace look like brad pitt in troy
Love seeing you guys do these kinds of videos again. It's why I started watching you back in 2020. Lots of food videos out there of people eating and critiquing but what you guys do is next level and imo 100 x better cuz u r taking it to the people! Keep it up!!
The 😯 eyes when trays are put before them!  What a treat for these lads 😄
That’s the next school trip! Chicago for some deep dish and Texas for some BBQ.
You need to come to the Midwest it's better
Can tell the headmaster is a genuine gentleman and i think he should be brought to texas to get a more genuine experience of Texas BBQ 😂
They needed some fried okra.
Mac and cheese is English btw 😂😂
Is it just me or does the headmaster's accent change at 6:29? Love seeing everyone just completely abandoning British decorum to go at it with their bare hands; must have been some really good BBQ.
This is what happens when you properly season your food
They have to be kidding that they don't like corn bread. Of all the corn bread I've had only " bad " corn bread is still something I would eat every time it's put in front of me.
I’m not from the south so my opinion may not be valid but I’m a firm believer that corn bread should always no matter what be eaten with honey butter on top
Jolly bros... you just ruined those kids. They are now going to spend the rest of their life trying to get to Texas for our food.  We'll welcome them when they make it!
They’re so expressive i love it
Bring that headmaster here to the States, please!
"I don't think I can eat here any more" 😅
Need to have them try Cajun food like alligator.
1) YOU DON'T EAT BBQ WITH A KNIFE AND FORK!!!!!! 2) If you ever do bring some of these students to the US, take them to Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City, Missouri for the best bbq in the world
As a New Englander.....this makes me smile
@jolly you're supposed to slice the ribs for serving.  Poor kids lol.
out of curiosity, they never have girls in this series, why is that?
Like the headmaster...so appreciates that good food.  I'm a Kansas City BBQ fan and I tend to like the beans/brisket and the sweet cornbread.  -The boys can test out all kinds of BBQ when they come to visit!  😀
I’m scared one of them is going to have a heart attack 😂
is British food that bland, that this kids say it's the best thing they ever eaten? 😂
I think the reason your people aren't big on the corn bread is because it doesn't have any good butter on it. Texas roadhouse (a chain restaurant in us) has amazing cinnamon butter you put on the rolls they give you. I could just make a meal of them myself.
Those kids are going to go back home in disgust at their mothers cooking🤣🤣🤣
These kids about to snooze after having some real comfort food😂
What sweet babies I love them all ❤🤷🏻‍♀️
It is so fun to see British students try American foods, and the headmaster too. I wonder how many will make it a point to visit America because they experienced American foods on Jolly. Good international relations!
Lol I pity these poor kids growing up in the worst food place in the world. Thinking Tesco sausages are actually real sausages is really sad 😂
This is why most Americans a overweight the foods just to good
As a Texan I approve!
Add butter or honey butter to your cornbread. Game changer.
Yes, it is all true. We eat like this everyday in Texas.  It is state law that all homes must have a smoker.
Please feed them gumbo, catfish and Cajun shrimp
Where is the corn on the cob?
There's hope for Posh Brits yet! :)
Kids left that room saying God Bless America 🇺🇸 🦅🦅🦅
Eating BBQ in a suit jacket and tie sure is something.
That did not look like the best corn bread.  It should have some butter melting on it too.
Funny to hear Pomp and Circumstance while eating ribs.
Welcome to America Kids!
Please stop eating the cornbread plain! Blah!!!!!!! Divide it into two and put butter on it first already!!!!!!!! Thank-you😀
the dry cornbread is so sad, someone get these kids hot honey-butter pls
Guys, how do you get these meals to them? Assuming you fly a chef out from a place you’ve visited? I can’t grasp this concept
Put some butter on that cornbread!
No one can put away food like a teenage boy.
What happened to the previous students?
As someone in the southern part of the US, the first thing I said when I saw that cornbread was, “That looks dry.” I’d guarantee if those kids tried some fried cornbread or some honey cornbread, they’d have loved it. (I eat my honey cornbread as dessert. 🤤)
@4:52 are they twins?  Looks like they're coming to America. Gotta go to New York and Texas and California
For the love of god they need to do red beans and rice
There's only 5 British people in this video.
Why is no one talking about that first kid that predator put the meat in his mouth with two hands
11:18 i'm with you young man, the breadcrumb topping on mac & cheese is just a waste
You're supposed to put butter and honey on that cornbread...
We also won 1776
Yes, I guess correctly! It was American BBQ.   Knew all of them were going to enjoy eating American BBQ especially Mr. Smith. Lol 😆   Also good to see them eat the food with their hands and not try to use knifes or forks. lol 😂
Some of them may be turning in their British citizenship papers!😂😂😂
I was born and raised in Texas.  My family has been here since before it was a state and I first heard of the Texas Fold was in this video.
Man .. as an American watching this somebody who cooks good BBQ could move to the UK & become a millionaire QUICKLY !
How did you get the barbecue to them?
Butter on that cornbread, boys!
Please take Dave everywhere in the world. But starting in the US
Slather cornbread in honey. Oh, so good. <3
Texas BBQ is hard to beat, texture, flavour, the serving size being so generous.  Really love the videos you guys put out ❤
Are those twins?
Do they not have pickles in Britain?
You probably just ruined other food for them... nothing will measure up. They're definitely moving to Texas.
i would like to see the parents reaction to the video of their kids reactions to texas bbq or bisquits and gravy southern chicken
They hated that cornbread lol should have given them some butter to go along with it.
How do you ship all that to them ?
These are my favorite episodes, when you visit the school!! The headmaster is my favorite!!!
I just adore these kids, and the headmaster is an absolute legend!
OFF THE BONE!
A great video series would be taking the Headmaster to select food experiences in the U.S., such as New Orleans, because of course, Texas for BBQ, Nashville for hot chicken, Chicago for pizza, etc. :)
Love you boys! But here’s an alert ‼️ we have this here in Nashville, Tennessee too! And just as fabulous! 🤣♥️👏🏻
It's funny watching these British kids and their different techniques for eating pork ribs. I like the one kid who says, "I don't think I can eat food here anymore." Expel the kids who say that baked beans are better than the pit beans.
And the best part about Texas BBQ is that its 100% technique so it can be copied by everyone.  Low and slow.
Why are the black kids segregated?
Great video. The headmaster is hysterical. Funny stuff, gentleman. The kids will remember this all their days.😂
You should never watch Jolly/Korean Englishman when you are hungry. I would smash that right now but their is nowhere anywhere near me where you can get it
Try HONEY on the cornbread ... it is a totally new thing.
Headmaster knows what’s up. The students pallet haven’t evolved yet
I continue to absolutely love these videos- seeing them actually LOVE American bbq is life-affirming in its own way. I think Dave needs to go to America with you guys the next time, given his reactions!
I believe world peace could be brought about if the worlds population had Texas BBQ
You gave those poor young men dry cornbread? What is wrong with you? No butter, honey butter or anything? That is just so wrong.
I love cornbread!!!!
Dumb question, where are you sourcing this?
I love these vidoes, their reactions are priceless, but I always wonder why it is only boys that you feed.
Trying Texas BBQ in the UK is like trying British food in London!
I’m not a fan of cornbread either, but I will eat it
Burnt Ends were invented in Kansas  City. You guys really need to try KC barbecue some time.
These are the best videos you guys make
Love this!
Cornbread is served with butter and honey, like biscuits.
my question is where did they get that level of quality texas bbq in the uk? did they make it themselves?
I love watching these videos cause you see British people make fun of our food all the time but if they would be able to try some good food like here they may have different opinions love the video keep up the good work boy's.
That little one enjoying everything...Just wanted to cut him a big slice of Icebox pie with a big scoop of salt can ice cream 😢.  It took EVERYTHING in me not fly to the UK and feed them babies...😂😂Southern GranGran
Those are some of the luckiest kids in the UK. Texas barbeque is the best, nobody does it like Texas.
If you google top restaurants in Britian #1 is Greggs. Dont ever tell me brits make good food😂 Italians come there and make it for them
i get that these kids where handpicked from a private school but there parents need to be commended for raising good children, love there honesty too, the kid that said i am here for the ride while giving pickles a go is exactly the attitude to have in life 🦘🇬🇧
The bread is a waste of space
You have to put honey butter on the cornbread you don’t eat it dry. At least butter
Hunny, that was just Texas BBQ.  When do you give them Carolina and Kansas City BBQ?
"Everything is better with bread, innit?"  I definitely agree.  Also, that moment at 09:09 when headmaster Dave let out that "Why does this ever have to end" sigh was powerful. 😁
I agree with the child on Cornbread.  It is so dry.
Nothing more American than watching the British people eat Texas BBQ
I have never in my 30 years of life had runny Mac & cheese. Not even Kraft. What the hell are they doing over there!
FIELD TRIP TIME
The teacher is a foodie, one of us 😂
That kid who said he doesnt like pickles but still puts them in his sandwich is what its all about.
You didnt give them cornbread drenched in butter and honey.... tsk, tsk, tsk.
To the British kids.  Don't come to America.  Stay home and fix your own country please.  We don't want your help.
The Headmaster cracks me up!😂
Have missed these students try videos. Cornbread shouldn’t disintegrate like that. Warm cornbread with butter is one of the best sides.
I'd like to see a video on the logistics involved getting all these things from the States into the UK when they're still fresh.
dill pickles ruin brisket. Herbs in general ruin brisket. even ur typical steak & roast herbs. your very basic vinegar, water, salt & sugar pickled cucumbers n onions on the other hand are god tier. chuck some hot peppers n garlic to pickle as well.
Cornbread is meant too have butter spread on it.
Never mess with USA when it comes to BBQ. Nothing is better! USA USA USA
You're missing a key ingredient for the cornbread.  Sorghum should be put on the cornbread.
Dare I say, that looks like a PROPER Brisket.
Need some butter and honey on that cornbread 🤤
I'm pretty sure the kid who told us to quit making cornbread just declared war on the entire South.
Loved this
Notice how everyone of the kids instantly grabbed for bread when they saw the beans. Hey, kids, beans don’t have to go on toast. Just take a spoonful and enjoy!
Thanks to this, I wanted BBQ, and that's what I'm having for dinner. Thanks guys !
❤❤❤
I love when you guys do the high school… these kids are so funny without even trying
These kids are savage there not holding back and on a side note add butter and honey and if you want  jalapeños in the batter but overall good vid
bbqing is the best as long as you are willing to wait a whole day to eat. i smoked a brisket and a rainstorm hit 6 hrs into cooking. started it at 6am, in the middle of the night at 3am (21 hours later) it was finally done. nothing better than plowin a couple pounds of meat at 3am on a sunday.
"You're the funny one!" --lad, you've no idea how truly hilarious Ollie is, naturally. Perfect.
I love the meat bonanza
i was thinking that maybe homosexuality in the physical is directed by homosexuality in the intellectual . For ex. if another man claims another mans trademark to his intellectual existence, that equals 1 gay in the physical. and if a female obtain trademark rights of a male that equals 1 male that tranny to woman. and if a corporation obtain trademark rights to an individual ... i wonder what that would equal ?#
this is a bulding for a british highschoolers go to NorthAmerica, and i love it
I love the kid who said he doesn't like pickles but put them on his sandwich anyway because "he's along for the ride" what a GREAT attitude! To keep trying something you don't like, just to see if maybe this time it will be better. That's nice.
I have missed getting to see the kids and Dave. They are always such a delight to watch!
There’s a strong need to introduce Texas BBQ to the UK; chain restaurants could potentially earn a fortune doing so.
Yall need to try beans and cornbread. (not baked beans)
It's about DARN TIME! Oh this will be exciting
The NEXT GENERATION... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Native Texan and never heard of a Texas Fold em. I won't be forgetting it from this moment on.
One thing I've noticed is Brits seem to not be into condiments. I kept saying "Put the BBQ sauce on it!!!" And where is the butter for the cornbread??? (That did look a bit dry.) They really needed some sticky, sweet, spicy sauce! And butter! Can't eat southern food and not have butter! It's a food group! 😂  And we need a campaign: "Bring Mr. Smith ❤ to America!"
I so enjoy these videos with the boys!
Headmaster over here lookin like the Coach from Mighty Ducks 2 when he turns temporarily evil.
OK, Hear me out. Jolly has opened my eyes that Texas BBQ changes opinions of the USA.  military weapons cost $2 million,  Brisket.....  costs $85. ( don't get ahead of me).... so if we drop briskets to the populations.... they just might become an friendly nation
Texas’s tourism after this video 🚀🚀🚀
I don't think I can eat food here again...lol
Subtitles are out of place from roughly 5:00-8:30
Tell the young man who doesn't like corn bread to try it with butter and honey spread on it...  THAT is a whole 'nother level.
Jiffy cornbread is the best!
I have to know who did the cooking!
How do you get it back home &still serve it freshly cooked??
Love watching the kids chow down, but DAVE is extra fun to watch!
"I dont think I can eat food here anymore" Youre ruining these kids 🤣
I have family in England. First time I went to visit was 1984. The food was horrid. Went back in 2024 thinking surely their food has improved since then. Nope!
So cool to see kids enjoying BBQ! Look how much they can eat! 😂
As an american, I can agree with the normal cornbread takes. My favorite cornbread is made by my grandmother, where she mixes yellow cake mix with the cornbread mix.
Headmaster Dave looks like he lost weight. Probably because he knows Josh and Ollie are bringing the tastiest high calorie foods they can find in the world for him and the kids to eat. Lucky!😂
How do they get it to the uk
Congrats on getting them some pretty legit-looking Texas BBQ.
Thank you for bringing 4th of July to these poor British souls. 😂🇺🇸
CORNBREAD AND BISCUITS MUST HAVE MELTED BUTTER ON THEM!  🤤
Now you know why we're all over 200lbs down here in the south haha😂
"I've had Bread" -British Commoner
I’ve been cooking Texas brisket for over a decade.  Showing the uninitiated the magic is always fun.  We used to reserve the tip of the point for someone who’d never had it.
You need butter with that cornbread.
I agree with the boys, I don’t like bread crumbs on my mac and cheese 🧀
That is what causes the meat sweats!!!  LOL!
How did they get Texas barbecue to the Uk?
Idk how you cannot like cornbread! Its an absolute delicacy
12:34 world's happiest headmaster
Everyone from Texas, who watch people who aren't from Texas eat Texas BBQ and hear them say, "This is so good! I've been missing out! I might cry!", are like "We know!"😂 I may not have been born in Texas, but I was born in the South and was raised in Texas, where the majority of my family lives and has lived, I can't imagine living anywhere else.❤
You gotta spread butter on that cornbread...
Hearing the young ones say it tastes lovely makes me happy.
Gotta add a little sugar to the cornbread batter; not a lot, but just enough to give it a taste.   Then, while warm, a nice spread of real butter between the halves makes it oh so good!!
Henry looks like goob from meet the Robinson's
I love the pure joy on the boys faces 😊
I’m kinda in agreement with the everyone that dislikes the cornbread, i myself am not a fan of
Good for Mr. Smith. It looks like he has lost quite a bit of weight! People sometimes think I fat shame others. But what I really like to see is people becoming healthier. Ask almost every person that has lost a significant amount of weight and they will tell you how much better they feel. Congrats Mr. Smith!
If I could have done this in high school, I’d have failed every year. Accidentally of course
I'm from America and never had Texas bah be q
Still dont know how to use condiments or how to use a piece of white bread
Where in the world do they get this BBQ from?
god bless america
Corn bread varies A LOT. The best I've had was jalapeno corn bread. So I get why they weren't impressed by it.
When summer break hits yall need to bring the headmaster to texas 🇺🇸🇺🇸
May e they should try fried cornbread…..
Imagine eating food and two people not eating and just staring at you and commentating and laughing hysterically the whole time. It’s kinda weird 😂
Always a good day when Dave is in the video
Good video! But people usually put honey or butter on cornbread. Dont knock it till you tried it that way haha.
That BBQ is so good it's also enjoyable to watch other people eat it. I might have some for dinner though
The flavors you are trying to comprehend are a little bit of salt and black pepper. Crazy that an imperialist nation such as the UK, one that conquered the oceans and lands in search of spices and then never uses them. Blows my kingless mind.
Everything looked good except that corn bread. If it is either dry or bland, it is done incorrectly. It should be a little sweet, moist, somewhat fluffy, and very buttery.
WHEN IS THE HEADMASTER GOING TO AMERICA?!
Ah Mr Smith missed that face. Looking good fella!! Agree with others, Dave needs a lads road trip with you 2
Texans are fat AF because we have the best cuisine: BBQ, Tex-Mex, Southern Soul Food, Cajun, Mexican Seafood
they got a real life goob in there.  meet the Robinson ahh boi
I wont like maybe its a little evil but Korean bbq or hot pot is  so delish but depending on what you get it'll get spicy but HOOoooo
LOVELY
Try cornbread dipped in pancake syrup.  Thank me later.
Warning to those kids:  do not come to America while we are in the throes of fascism. Do not support the current regime. There is good bbq in London—ask Ollie.
The headmasters eyes rolled back in his head...  I thought u were gonna have to help him out.... Lol
Take the headmaster on a trip!!
I love the head master in all of these!
There's cornbread and then there's cornbread.  That cornbread looked like the tasteless kind.
0:51 the choir music when you brought out the brisket 😂😂😂
Love watching them enjoy BBQ ❤❤❤
That last kid with the cornbread crack...Kid, we'll give you some moist cornbread with honey butter, and if you reject THAT, well, your tastebuds are dead. Bury them.
My favorite videos. These kids are incredible. More cornbread for me.
Not all BBQ is alike.  In California we slice our links and put it in sauce and our cornbread is like cake. I've never heard of pit beans, only pork and beans.  We have 7 up cake,sweet potato pie and (sock it to me) cake.
OH YES ♥️⭐️💙
The way my family always ate cornbread in my growing up was with butter melted over it then smothered with clear Caro syrup. You had to eat it with a spoon, but it was delicious….no wonder my parents developed diabetes!
Should've made the corn cake version of cornbread, generic corn bread is honestly pretty mid, even to a Texan 😅
I don’t care if it’s not “authentic.” Sweet, soft cornbread is where it’s at!
Love to see those big bites!!
I swear every Southerner who knows how to Smoke & BBQ properly needs to travel the world and spread the love of Southern BBQ to every state and country across the globe and I think this could bring true peace and harmony everywhere, especially to any and all hostile territories!
The youngest fellow that thought everything was lovely really enjoyed the experience.
This is why we have so many fatsos in the South. Hahahahahaha!
They have crossed the Rubicon.
Nah if they said that cornbread was bland, it wasn't right. It should be buttery and delicious without extra butter. For a UK version of Texas bbq though, y'all did well.
I hate cornbread too. It's too dry and crumbly. Corn Casserole (Cornbread pudding) is AMAZING though, so I just go with that.
Put butter on your corn bread
I love these boys almost as much as I love smoked meat.
THIS HOW LIFE SHOULD BE  EXPERIENCED  WITH TOTAL JOY  !! THANKS GUYS FOR ALL THE SMILES ... USA HERE ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I live in Texas in the heart of BBQ country and now I am hungry.
Couple things about the sausage. The "crack", as he put it when you bite into it is what Americans refer to as the snap. ALL really good hot dogs and sausage in the US have a snap. Beef sausage is very common, yes, but I would say the majority of American sausage is a mix of meats, typically pork and chicken, or pork and beef. Sometimes a mix of all three! American sausages, including Texas smokes, are heavily influenced by both the American beef industry and German and Polish immigration to the United States in the 19th century.
have to say it.... how do you get texas bbq there???
Yeehaaw baby 😂
Like the mammoth shirt!
Makes my Texas heart proud to see them love the BBQ.
You should try a cornbread and meat sandwich 🥪
Most bbq restaurants are mostly just a giant wood grill with long periods of cooking it's relatively simple but the end result is really well prepared food. 😊😊
These are my favorite videos! Love these kids! ♥️
Ahh, yes... but was the cornbread, mac and cheese, and beans made properly? And where is the potato salad?
When people ask what American food is… this is it
I just love the little boy who keeps saying “ This is Lovely “! 🥰
I do enjoy your content. Been a long subscriber….  Always seem to be posh schools. What about normal public chools. Common people.
I Love the expression on their faces❤❤❤❤
Honestly, you didn't do the cornbread right.
Not gonna lie — if it’s done right, brisket is the undisputed king of meat
He needs to try southwest cornbread
“I don’t think I can eat food here anymore.” Spoken like a true Brit that has had spices for the first time. Look, America isn’t perfect BY FAR. But when we get serious, food, family and love, we can’t be beat!
That was so fun! These kids are legit funny. I’m 41 and from the south, I still don’t like cornbread😊
I’ve been waiting for this video since they tried biscuits and gravy for the first time 😂
Actually, pork is the main meat for sausages in the US, it can be difficult to find beef sausages in the grocery store. Great stuff when you can find it. Best sausage I ever had was some venison breakfast sausage, but Ive only had it once.
On this episode of the British try seasoning...
I'm always laughing to myself when Brits react to mediocre food like it's special.
The most primitive style of food is the absolute best, fire & meat 🍖 Even a vegetarian would naturally feel the human instinct to want to eat this BBQ style food
The blond kid almost started a war  with the corn bread comment.
Dave Smith looking very trim👍
Take them all to America for a tour
That cornbread needs butter. Lots of butter.
Pecan pie, pumpkin pie, and Texas BBQ. The biggest surprise for so many.
In 4 years the USA will be better. I hope.
Those kids are going to need a nap after all that meat!😅
Josh,Ollie, I did not think you could top your Texas BBQ reactions which was freaking hilarious. Guys these young men n the Headmaster's reactions is just to much im wiping tears n my face is hurting from laughing n grinning. Thanks, Josh n Ollie for making my day and great start for the weekend. I'll be re-watching this several times.😂😂😂😂
2:48 it has always astonished me the way kids have this magical talent of completely dismantling a person's self-image in a single sentence. "You're the funny one." 🤣🤣🤣
Who cooked the BBQ?
Maybe not in Texas, but cornbread in Kentucky is either sweet, or if not sweet, then it requires butter. Mandatory. And real butter not that vegetable oil crap.
Next generation of schoolkids are as hilarious as the old ones. They can have the beans... no thank you! But the beef ribs and brisket I'd hurt someone over. 😂😂😂
I know they all went home and demanded BBQ from their parents😂
See everyone outside the USA makes fun of our size. That's because our food is banging! If you grow up with this kind of food you'd be big too.
“You want it to be more bland.” Kid: yeah. Pertaining to the Mac n cheese. 😂😂😂
And after this meal, they took a big, long nap.
I really enjoy these type of videos. The look of pure enjoyment is fun to see. It reminds me of the other high-school boys they took to Korea but are now grown men. They should 2.0 and take the new boys to Korea or US? 😊
If looks could tell a story the looks on their faces would tell me food can give a man an erection
If you did the captioning manually,  you might want to check it cause it's in the wrong order.
USA tour with Dave, please. 😂❤
"Have you not eaten in a week?" Bro shook his no so fast
No such thing as a Texas Fold
No dainty little nibbles and pecks to 'test the waters' with this group. These Brits are eating it the way it was mean to be eaten. With decadent abandon. Cheers!
Bless their hearts!! Getting good food, but do appreciate that they eat healthy at home forsure!!
these kids are going to riot, if the uk does not start adding spices to the food
This was so fun, kids are awesome!
Only like half of these kids are British lol
Great video, next you have to introduce these kids to real Mexican food!
But does Mack look like a young Brad Pitt to anyone else?
12:54 have you not eaten in a week 😂😂😂😂😂.
Simply the best, gentlemen! I love it! It is so awesome to see others try our Texas/American barbecue for the first time!
Some pit master in  Memphis just blew his top.
Those reactions are hilarious! I'm a Texan who doesn't like corn bread either, I've only ever had one that I loved and it wasn't dry and tasted a bit sweet and was amazing with butter. Otherwise I don't eat it. Everyone likes what they like. Lol Love from Texas
Love this show so much
should start doing this but with only the teachers lol
Who made that BBQ? Did they set up a smoker outside?
Give them a proper cornbread... cooked in a cast iron skillet with corn and slathered with maple butter.  You get caramelized edges and more moisture. We can tell over here on the other side of the pond that THAT corn bread was dry and left for the pups. AND... those pork ribs should be falling off the bone - they would be if you gave them North Carolina style ribs.
Stop squishing the meat! It’s like when someone in the US takes their spatula and presses the love out of a Burger or other on the backyard grill
The quotes from this are so good, "Have you not eaten for a week?"
Dis the headmaster lose some weight?
Oh, to be young again and eat as much as you like :) This is my favorite episode now.
The Headmaster is awesome! Guy had an out of body experience!
i always love this series with students! 😍
Why is there cornbread being served without butter?
I love this!
That one boy looks like a young Brad Pitt
The first Jolly video iy ever had pop up was when they had the school boys try biscuits and gravy. I still enjoy the boys and Lord Smith!
Alternate video title: How to convert Brits into Texans.
They need to try the Mac and cheese with any of the BBQ meat and some BBQ sauce. “Porky Mac” is what it’s called in my area of the States.
Please bring the Headmaster to America on any of your shows! I really like his humor and take on American food! Plus he seems to be a genuine (as you British say) Bloke!👍
They need sweet corn bread
The disrespect of the cornbread hurts so much lol
Why do yall try to sell someone on our cornbread without BUTTER??? 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
As a southern American I am speaking for the south when I say bring the headmaster to us 😂
Wait, what happened with the beans and cornbread? 😢 I like that they like it. That's awesome!
Jalapeño cheese cornbread will change their minds
As a southern american all i can say is hell yeah!!.  Love this headmaster like the other comments have said
what age do you start high school in the uk? why do some of these kids look 10-12?
You’re so welcome as this Floridian is JEALOUS of every piece they were eating!!
Love their reactions & delight..BUT how did they get Fresh Texas BBQ across the pond?
I dunno why but it makes me so happy to see people try bbq for the first time and love it as much as I do!
Cornbread needs honey butter on it.
Hey you guys should have told them about BBQ bowls, Beans on the bottom then coleslaw, then brisket/ or pulled pork
u gonna see some high schoolers Coom
It's probably too late to do anything about it but heads up, the subtitles went wonky around the 5:05 mark. Anyway, great video 😊
Hey Y'all PUT SOME BAR B Q SAUCE ON THERE........,.. Blessings from Texas 💯💯💯💯💯
lol, that's not hot dog skin boys.... Cheers.
How do they get this food over there and still be good?
As a Southerner, I'd have to try that cornbread. If they didn't like it, then something's wrong.
Always love the school kids trying American foods. They are proper and hilarious.  Good on the Headmaster and parents. I know it's not exactly accurate to get what we taste over here. Cornbread did look like the Sahara tho.
There is nothing better than watching these kids eat Texas BBQ. It makes me so happy.
Eating cornbread alone is WILD.  You gotta take a slice and pour beans on it! Baked beans on cornbread, chili beans on top, Gravy, BUTTER and Honey. Not all at the same time though. I would say eating cornbread without a topping is like eating a plain slice of bread, not really anything to speak of.   Having breakfast gravy on top of a slice of cornbread is GREAT.   Also anyone else feel like these kids will always look back to this meal and ALL other food they eat in their lives will never compare???
You gotta have cornbread with Butter. 🇺🇸
These poor boys never had real food till now - Texas BBQ!! - yeehaw!!      As a life-long Texas boy having Tx-BBQ my whole life, I too was pretty disappointed with food in the UK when I was there.
Need some honey to go on that cornbread.
This should just be called "Brist taste food for the first time" Lol
The kids always seem a bit picky. Too much cheese? Is that possible? 😂 The headmaster Is fun to watch. Also, you should really try cornbread pudding, which is moist.
“You’re the funny one…” Brilliant
Where did they find that food in uk? would love to try it
Beans go with the cornbread
Dave is so awesome to watch lol. Might be cool to eventually take a group of kids to the south for a trip!
Jalapeno Cornbread is the way to go!
I like these new kids you guys choosen
I never eat cornbread with BBQ but that missing butter and honey
"Not like steak fat, where its chewy and you might wanna cut it off." BRUH, what kind of steak they be eating...steaks I make/order are never like that.
In England, combs only go back to front. By the king's order, never front to back!
Beavos little brother chews his food with his mouth WIDE OPEN.
Someone didn't know how to make corn bread
This is adorable
The Mammoth Mountain shirt took me back.
As a Texan we appreciate the props on the barbeque. Glad you enjoyed it. Great content as always.
having watched many of your highschoolers try xyz videos i fully think the headmaster only agreed so he could get some of the food too
I feel bad i can tell just by the way they are touching the cornbread its dried out. I know they cant do too much about be yeah that was some dry cornbread
THAT ONE KID LOOKING LIKE GOOB FROM MEET THE ROBINSONS I CANT
So I'm curious, did you bring someone back from Texas to make this haha?
There’s nothing quite like authentic Texas BBQ 🤤
This makes me proud to be a Texan! The Lone Star State
You need honey butter on the cornbread
I'm glad to see some of the classic Jolly content back, such as Ollie's dad and visits to highschoolers, including their headmaster.
The most British thing was how everyone took a bite from the middle of the Texas fold
Best food in America? Visit Texas
What are these parents feeding these kids--or should I say what AREN'T they feeding them ??!! So sad !!
did it come from texas
Bring Dave to Texas
14 minutes of one religious experience after another -- aka another JOLLY home run!
Each plate will cost about $40
Yes !!!!!
Jolly…I love your videos and British high schoolers is the best…I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again….You should bring the School master with you on an American 🇺🇸 tour and I think it would be a big hit !!
Headmaster is awesome!
😂😂😂
@11:08 Ollie’s facial emote of confusion/disappointment is superb 😂😂😂😂
The "God Bless America" music in the background is too funny
The headmaster should have his own show with food.
Sweet Harry is just such a lovely young man enjoyin all these news tastes & experiences 😊💗. I always love seeing our Mr. Smith, too. His enjoyment & kindness show in his boys 🙏☺️💞.
"What age can you legally move to America."  I'd love to give you a tour of Texas and some of the best BBQ spots. 1 spot is Franklin's BBQ. The lines are long but it is so worth it.
Cornbread is better with honeybutter anyways
For everything that we Americans have on the English for food, y'all totally stomp us when it comes to sweets.
Get the kid who keeps saying "lovely" and the 2 blonds some screen tests and bring them to america
I must be getting old because they're all looking like kids to me, except the bloke with the hairline 😅
:) All of us Americans are smiling right now. We have a culture. We don't have one thing that can truly define it, because each state has one or several things that define it. When it comes to food.
Blacks in England seem much more educated and classier than American blacks. Simple observation. Much better culture over there.
lol that imported meat just to cook it in uk
1:27 trying burnt ends first is crazy. That’s like golden compared to the rest. Shame.
I hope you sent some home with them so their family could try it too. If not they would never believe them.
I love to take potato chips and dip them into my beans.  Great video guys
I'm going to miss that one kid that doesn't like spicy food. He was so funny to watch. These are hilarious though, you get full honestly out of these kids.
My mouth is mesmerized lol
"You're the funny one".
My son is 10 and he’s a wimp compared to those 9 year olds
Somebody jacked up the cornbread because it should be buttery and sweet.
LOL, gotta love seeing Headmaster Dave LOVING it all.   of course he's gonna like the sweet tea!  that man loves sweets.  Gonna need to bring some of these boys to the US and let em enjoy all the crazy.   Fun you got to show them TX BBQ.  It looked so yummy.  Glad to see all these new firsts with continuing with the school.   Or make is a grown up thing and just bring HM Dave?  This would be epic!  Bring Dave to the US and let him be fed by all your new friends.
i love this series
Not a fan of corn bread either. If I make it I include a bit of sharp cheddar and fresh jalepenos, but that is MY preference.
I'm glad our cousins across the pond are enjoying every bite of American propaganda. 🦅🦅🦅
I miss being an age when I could just eat as much as humanly possible - no matter the food!
Butter that cornbread maybe.
I have to say..this is one of your best videos ever 👍 Lord Dave Smith for Prime Minister or at least Governor of BBQ
They should have tried buttermilk cornbread
😅😅😅😅😅😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So great to see the kids eagerness try new things!! Reminds me of our past kids..you know..the all grown up ones that we all still follow..lol..they're like our kids or nephews..love those young men!! Now we get to watch these new boys experience life through amazing food and fun times!! Go Jolly!!
I love the headmaster. He enjoys himself so much. 😂
Cute kids.  Im glad they liked it.
Matt looks like the younger version of Brad Pitt
Love the headmaster
Love their genuine reactions...
This guys look like they dead and want food heave.😂
3:45 LMAO
The headmaster saying that cornbread is like croutons when you have that kinda spread is spot on.
Everything is better with bread 🍞🥪 haha so true 😅
This is why I tune in!! Absolutely love the young men's faces when they try new food..and of course the headmaster.
Better than beans on toast!
I love how the kid said he didn’t understand how people eat the whole beef rib.  My 130 pound wife will take down a whole beef rib by herself when we go to Texas. 😂😂😂
I wonder how often the kids go home, tell their parents they want that again. And their parents just curse you guys for brining all this amazing food to taste
Glad you enjoyed the BBQ, guys, but they didn't bring you any banana pudding or peach cobbler?  Such a shame.  Next time.  😊
11:58 "Trying to sneak beef in everything" He's got it.
“How are Americans so fat?” - every person from Europe… proceed to cram food down when they try our food
I love that it was unanimous and I love the headmaster.  If they only knew the variety of beans and sausages we have, they'd go nuts!
cornbread is best hot and fresh with a pat of butter, it's divine
I've seen so many 'Brits try bbq' videos that I'm shocked that no one opens a bbq joint over there.
Now you see why america is fat
OH YEAH I FORGOT ABOUT THESE GUYS WTF I FORFOT THIS WAS FHE SAME CHANNEL
Those young gentlemen will never be the same again after eating all that food.
take the cole slaw off, add diced red onions
These kids are so adorable! And they have excellent vocabulary: "sublime" "mesmerized". Have to bring the headmaster to the US. He's terrific!
This was my favorite jolly video. These kids are awesome 😂
Did he hurt his hand? One of the boys I mean
Love watching the English school kids try American food
As a Texan, I can say that tea was too light to be true Texas Tea...😅Glad the boys and Headmaster could try bbq though! Howdy from Austin, Texas
Perhaps that's the #1 issue with most Brits... what they really need, what they are truly looking for is... flavor.
I bet someone could make a killing opening a Texas bbq hole-in-the-wall in the UK  Jolly-guys, you could be part owners by helping your pitmasrer go train in Texas and then come back to open a place with your financial backing
The kids reactions are excellent, but I look forward to the Headmaster's reactions the most
🤗😸🤗😸🤗This is Supercatsarefragileexceptforhalitosis phantasmagoricaly phuntastical, it made me so happy just listening to it and the children's interactions. 🤗👏👏👏🤗🤗
Love  you guys.  Humble and honest, always. I'm  not a big Brit fan because  Most Of you are arrogant Ass---les. But I  appreciate  you two
Jolly / Task Master is my weekly window into the UK
Come On Over!… 👋 🇺🇸 Is Awaiting You!
"I don't think I can eat food here anymore" To be fair, England has great fish and chips.
Cornbread is supposed to be buttered y'all.
Moving here would be great.  You would get the BBQ, AND adjusting to life under a king won’t exist, though you still have a Parliament whereas ours is going away.  If you can handle the fascism I know some great BBQ spots.
Never make cornbread again? Please don't ever come to America and say that! Shameful!
Those are some negative nearly Bratz! Don't make cornbread again when you just had a delicious meal... honestly!
its like im watching the pig roast scene from lord of the flies
did he say dont make cornbread again when a british person probably made the "Texas BBQ"
This is a very happy group of ppl lol
Absolute TOOLS in comments everywhere turning everything into a political statement or argument. This is a channel to enjoy people’s reaction to food and get some humor tossed in, not a channel to debate elections. Read the room people!
WHAT I THINK WOULD TOP THIS is four years later, gather the same kids and the headmaster for another taste surprise and surprise them with the same american bbq.  No doubt they would be so excited!
For the love of God, put BUTTER on the CORNBREAD.
I love cornbread, but even I'm not a fan of eating it dry. You need butter on your cornbread. Or butter and honey.
Idk what you did to the cornbread but to get that much of a negative reaction something was off, love he chose the "negative route" haha
Tell Mack he is welcome to come to America any time he wants to....    he doesn't need any special permission!!    :)
Many have said it, but you've got to bring Dave to America to try this in person, at Goldies or Terry Black like you guys did.  I'd love to see Dave try all the things .    Antoher great episode thanks Jolly!
I think the og student from the first episode need to try this bbq plate as well.
"If you had this here, how often would you-E V E R Y D A Y" 😂Same buddy, same, if it weren't for the pricetag
You need to put butter on the cornbread.  We just call it a fold-over.  I do that with PB&J.
Need to tell the Headmaster that when he goes to Portugal to try egg tarts.
I live in texas but i’m still jealous 😭
I can picture a couple of these guys making it big like Max and Armand did.
Sorry, but that was not proper cornbread. Also, serve it slightly warm with butter or honey but preferably both.
I was born in Texas and I lived there till I was in my 20s. I’m at work watching this with a big smile on my face and feeling a little homesick.
Texas BBQ --- Enough Said 😁😉👍🤤🤤🤤
As a Texan i cannot watch this and not feel a sense of IMMENSE State Pride.   Another name for a Texas Fold is a "Gringo Taco" in my part of Texas, we include flour tortillas that are a bit overcooked/Charlie "Brown" on the Comal to add a slightly smokey/ charred flavor to the bite.
Dave is an American at heart! (Like spirit, not congestive)
High schooler episodes are my favorite! I do have an inquiry. Why do Brits seem to follow a statement with a question? "This is delicious. Isn't it?" It's like needing to ask for approval for their statement. Isn't it? The headmaster seems to be someone you would want to have pint with. Doesn't he?
Thise boys have the heart of a Texan.  We all eat bbq the same way
I love the highschoolers!
Hey, at least THEY didn’t start eating it with a knife and fork… 😎
where did they get texas BBQ from!
Corn bread without butter and honey is just not right
Bringing salty, fatty, sweet foods to a bunch of kids going through growth spurts, in the guise of revisiting your old stomping grounds, is probably the most brilliant approach to your content that you could deliver. Absolutely top-tier reactions whenever you two do this. The kids pure honesty, and the headmaster's dry humor never seem to miss.
How did they get Texas BBQ to the UK?? 🤷
That is not tea. That looks like dirty  sink water. Brew that tea til it is dark.
We need a Texas trip with Dave and Mr. Z ASAP
Ollie's expression at "I don't like the crusty bits [of the mac]" is maybe the most baffled he's ever looked, which I feel like is saying something.
Mmm, time to run over to Truth BBQ or Blood Bros. bbq in Houston.
I'm so glad someone FINALLY told them what to do with the white bread instead of letting it just sit there like a decoration! 😋
I love all your videos, but my favorite are the high schoolers! They all try everything and are very honest! I’m from Oklahoma and most of us only serve cornbread warm with butter. Never cold and dry. 😂
12:50 they've won this time yea
Kids, Mac n cheese isn't supposed to be runny. 🙄
Keep waiting for these kids to get the meat sweats… lol
Have you ruined Sunday Roast for these youngsters? 😊
And of course, as all Americans know, there are several very different regional variations on BBQ, not to mention distinct approaches and tastes perfected by thousands of professional pitmasters throughout the country. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had in my life was way up north in Williamsburg, PA, home of the Little League World Series. But, this was priceless to watch!
Cornbread needs parings; you can't eat it by itself.  Warm and buttered with a drizzle of honey,  or crumbled in a bowl of soup or soupy beans, or crumbled in a bowl with milk. Y'all should have added some BBQ Sauce to the beans for the guys that didn't like them.  The flavor would be similar to what they normally eat. It was absolutely heart warming seeing all those young Carnivores attacking that meat with joy. NO Fear, no trepidation, just muching on that glorious meat.
My family is from Eastern North Carolina.  We don't eat the cake looking cornbread, we eat flat, crispy cornbread cook in the oven.
I think that one kid had so much inner rage about his "mum" serving him tasteless food his entire life that he took ot out on the cornbread.  😂😂  I'm baffled how one would choose canned Heinz beans on toast over amazing BBQ beans with brisket in it... 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
This is funny😂
3:04 shame on you, Jolly. They're not supposed to be using a knife fork.🤪🫵👍
Welcome to flavor town fellas 👍
Why was the cornbread so dry, boys? You need salted butter and honey.
As a Texan i will say you guys need to try the Three main variations of Texas BBQ: Smoked with Post Oak, Smoked with Mesquite, Smoked with Pecan wood/shells,  the taste differences are AMAZING!!!
Why do they always say "high schoolers", but it's ALWAYS just boys??
Why do yall segregate the kids during the interview?
The words "too cheesy" sound so foreign to me. Can there really be such a thing? 😂
To be fair, we almost never eat cornbread by itself. At the very least slice it tops from bottoms and stuff a large pat of butter in between it. It is best when placed in a bowl of beans (and not your typical canned beans, at least not without some serious upgrading added) and some finely diced white or yellow onions or chopped green onions with maybe a few dollops of good catsup and/or hot sauce. It's even better when it's made with finely diced jalapenos. I almost cried when I saw them immediately place the beans on white bread. That is just so sad... that habit had to come from the post-war, difficult to come by food days. When you're kids and your parents make a big fuss over what they're feeding you, just so you'll eat it because they, in their hearts, know it's crap but it's all they have.
"You can really tell you've never had ribs before"  Says the guy who almost ate them with a fork and knife
Texas fold is NOT REAL. It's just a BBQ sandwich. Please stop propagating Weismann's nonsense.
You really need to bring that principle with you next time you come to the USA...give him the full treatment...
Now here me out. Since they can be 100% non biased. Let's have the prep school kids try all the different  types of bbq from the US. Just for bragging rights. Texas, Carolina, Kansas city, Memphis, Alabama, and so on.  Also I'd like for yall to get Tom Holland on the show and feed him good American bbq so he can eat his words about what he said about the food in the US.
Why do y’all insist on eating cornbread by itself?  It needs butter when the cornbread is warm. Add some jelly if you want.   When we make a pot of beans we add butter to the cornbread and or dip it or place it in the bowl of beans.  Do whatever you want if it’s plain cornbread.  I usually make jalapeño cornbread that has cream style corn and oil in it. It’s very moist and absolutely delicious.
Please bring Mr Smith to Texas so he can try all things texas bqq, and take him to buc-ee's so he can try all the snacks
Try corn bread with butter 🧈
lmfao @10:19
highschool? look like 6-8th graders
butter, cornbread without butter is a sin.
8:48 : HES HAD SO MUCH DIFFERENT TYPE OF WHAT
Trust me...the food DOES NOT make up for the rest of the circus.  Just open up some authentic restaurants.
The kid that made the mop bucket analogy that Ollie diasagreed of is classic. Game should recognise game.
I love watching the kids experience new foods...
that must be UK cows cause that brisket looks lean as hell
Headmaster needs to try real Texas bbq in Texas
Nothing is more British than the fact that everyone immediately put the beans on the bread without even really thinking about it, something we don't really do in the US. 🤣
These 'school vodeos' are my very favorite‼😂
Cornbread with honey butter 🤤
Need to put butter on that cornbread
RECIPE SUGGESTION:  If you can ever find the boxes of "Jiffy" cornbread mix. Mix 2 boxes of cornbread mix with 1 box of "Jiffy" Yellow Cake Mix, mix together and use the directions all the same. THEN, melt some butter, add some honey, and voila, honey butter.
You can't go wrong with BBQ
BRING THE HEAD MASTER TO TEXAS 🎉🎉🎉
Stop making cornbread ? You just got yourself banned from the United States  ! 🇺🇸
absolutely brilliant reactions all round 😂🎉the boys and david really had a great time
You failed completely on the cornbread.  Where's the butter and honey?  No wonder they thought it was dry.
Josh is equating the beef sausage with a hotdog? No. In the US hotdogs are considered “technically sausages” but they’re never what we mean when we’re talking about sausages.
You guys should take the kids to America for a video.
I love watching europeans eat food like this. Because i hear how fat americans are with a touch of judgement all the time  from my european friends and then to watch them try our top end food and see the lights go on in their faces.
Operation: Get Dave to Texas.
As an American I can agree about the crunch on the Mac and cheese. Not a fan either
The headmaster is such a mood 🤣
I am a Southern. I was born in Louisiana and have also lived in Mississippi, Georgia, Texas and Florida.  I don’t blamed them. Your cornbread was way too dry. Most people can’t make good cornbread. So I’m not surprised.  When it’s bad, it’s bad. But when it’s made right, then it’s really good.  Same with grits. It has to be made correctly. And when it’s made right, then it’s really amazing.
We miss the older chap Theo.
You throw a whole bunch of grilled meats to teenage boys, how can they not love it. 😂
I always enjoy the student experiences.
They might like Mexican cornbread better. Especially if they make like my family does where the cornbread is barely holding together all the sausage, bacon, cheese and jalapeños.
I'm in Memphis and we are particular about our BarBQ here
i miss some of the old lads, but i suppose they grew up and moved on. enjoying the new fellas tho. CHEERS!!!!
Its sad they never tasted brisket
You guys should big up Wilson's BBQ. He's been to us with the big BBQ joints
Im curious. Are you getting these items from a local restaurant, or ordering from the US and shipping over frozen?
It’s a shame bc they have to go back to eating tuna cheese on a baked potato.    And the one that said don’t ever make cornbread again…calm down
Crucial question: was the cornbread made with sugar or without? As a Midwesterner, I always make my cornbread with sugar, but my understanding is that that's a divisive issue in the South. Suffice it to say, I wouldn't like eating unsweetened cornbread either, especially if no one gave me any butter or honey to put on it.
you need to bring those poor boys some plastic straws next time you come back from the states so they don't have to drink out of those cardboard monstrosities
Showing the clip of those kids from last year is so funny because puberty hit them eh
As a Texan, my biggest complaint about nearly every BBQ joint is that they will invest 12-18 hours into slow smoking their brisket and they won't invest the 6 hours to make next level pinto beans.  Brisket has to be pretty heavily trimmed for smoking.  That abundance of trim is why BBQ joints will make their own sausages to smoke alongside the brisket.  But because professional trimming yields far more fat than meat in the trim, sausage making still leaves a ton of unrenderable beef fat unused given the optimal meat to fat ratios for sausage.  The piles of surplus beef fat can then be cut up and rendered down into beef tallow on its own.  This allows for wrapping briskets in tallow lined butcher paper when it comes off of the smoker and goes into a warmer to rest for another 12 hours or so at like 150-160 degree Fahrenheit (of 65-70 degrees Celsius).  When you do a very low 6 hour slow simmer of pinto beans with a healthy dose of beef tallow in the water, the starch released by the beans as they absorb warm water over several hour mixes with and interacts with the beef fat and what should be a deliberate mix of seasonings to generate a slightly gelatinous, opaque and incredibly flavorful bean broth that coats the beans.  Especially, given the degree to which the British put their beans on toast (or bread), I would expect them to appreciate wat the difference in method adds.  Doing all of this very slowly at a 6 hour pace as opposed to a 2 hour pace makes all the difference in the world.  Admittedly, the use of black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne, granulated garlic, onion powder and salt might be overwhelming for a British palate.  😜
no gravy?
“Trying to sneak beef into everything.” He is starting to understand Texas.
Those are not texas pork ribs.
Did they get the "meat sweats?"
The twins are absolutely hilarious!
you've ruined these kids forever. they will never know bliss like this again. shame on you
oh my word what are you feeding those poor kids in GB? just beans?
Brits like to make fun of Americans for being fat. Now they know why! 😂 they would be too if they had our food!
Irish butter on warm cornbread. Hmmmmm!!
LOL that child was so offended by corn bread  that he had to tell the ENTIRE SOUTH to stop making it immediately 🤣
Bring Dave to America!
Who in hell doesn't like pickles ???  The heel of the brisket is the best part. Fact.  74 year Texan here and I don't like "crispy top" mac 'n cheese either.  My own cornbread recipe, which is a slightly coarse bread with NO sugar of any kind and made with buttermilk is often consumed straight from the skillet simply buttered. If the young'n doesn't like it that's his loss.
Love their understated enthusiasm. “So lovely, so nice”. Love watching their reactions. That food is from heaven.
Thick sweet cornbread is not typically Texan.  We call it yankee cornbread in Texas.  Our cornbread is usually thinner, cooked in an iron skillet and not very sweet.
We need these young men, and the headmaster too, on a tour of the US!! Next summer?!
The cornbread looks dry...
The one tall kid looks like young Chad Michael Murray
Now they need to try some real TexMex!!  Much love from Texas!  Sweet yellow cornbread is my favorite with butter - Beans and cornbread YUM!!
As a lifelong Texas girl this made me smile! It brought pleasure knowing my native dishes were so well received! 💙
Love your videos ❤😊
this might be the happiest Dave has ever been in a vid 😂
As a Texan, I love watching these kids eating brisket! Warms my heart! ❤
I dont understand though. Who and how are you getting this properly made there at the school for these kids. As someone here in Louisiana/Texas who has been to the UK many times and is a part owner in a pub in Essex, it's questionable. lol
American BBQ is the best!  No one comes close to topping it.
Also in favor of taking Headmaster down to Texas for some BBQ and other goodies. He's a man who will thoroughly appreciate the chance.
On3 of your best videos! Congrats Boys
thats how you eat BBQ
Loved all the smiles the food brought
Kansas City is the birthplace of Burnt Ends!!!  BEST Barbecue in the world!  Now you know why Americans are fat, LOL
Me as a Texan, this was a joy to watch.
Bring back the cab drivers!
Cornbread needs lots of melty butter and some honey. Or better yet, lots of honey butter!
Ive had cornbread that was absolutely amazing.....but ive had way more that i didnt care for at all.
You're the funny one!!!!!!!!
AI generated illustration??? disappointed 🙄🙄🙄
This makes me happy as a Texan
I find it funny how British people hate Americans. All you have to do is just read online posts What they have to say about us but yet they are fascinated about american culture and food. I just can't understand this with them?
You know the food is good when there is very little conversation. Just tucking into the meal.
I admire their willingness to at least try everything.
They all don't like the cornbread because it's too plain. They should LOVE that, they are British 🤣 then complain about other stuff having too much flavor lol
These are high school students? They look like they're 9 years old.
Ok, step 1: put some butter on that cornbread. Step 2: dip it in some gravy. Step 3: enjoy
Merica’ 🇺🇸
Working on smoked ribs, collards, cornbread, & deviled eggs as we speak ... and yes, I live in "the south" :)
Im just curious do we know who cook all that ? Is it gaby ?
You all need to take the headmaster on a culinary US tour.
Don’t get me wrong brisket done right is one of my favorite things to eat. Im from Tennessee but never had true Texas BBQ, but I just have to ask and im genuinely curious on your legit answer. Is it just that boring over there in the UK or is the food and amusement parks etc in the USA really just that much better? Because to see yall go crazy over Hardee’s breakfast is just funny to me! Like yes I love me some Hardee’s biscuits and gravy but there is so much better than all these fast food joints yall go nuts over lol
"you can really tell you guys have never eaten ribs before" shut up!!!! Their primal devouring is exactly what barbecue is all about!!! 😂
Is the headmaster related to your cameraman. same expressions.
😋 texas bbq is ambrosia
11:35 "I think it's cheesey but it's not the same cheese I'm used to. It's more like rich--"  "Oh you want it to be more bland?"  "Yeah."  My heart just sank when I heard that. 😢💔
Your cholesterol just quadrupled....
British kids.... never had anything with flavor
Next time add whipped honey butter on the cornbread😊
More than one of these kids cried tears of joy during this video haha
Yearning for the colonies that’s what I like to see USA USA USA!!!!
You forgot to give them butter for the cornbread!! 😭
Best school day ever.
You need honey and butter on the bread come on man
I think I'll get some corn bread tonight out of spite :P
They stomach not used to this , it’s over for they toilet later 😂😂
Cornbread needs butter to make it great.   It can be too dry without it.
Quit. Saying british beans they are american beans on toast..
Love how they're honest about everything, whether they liked it or not. No sugar coating, just blatant palette preference opinions, just makes it feel so more real. This was a joy to watch.
You gotta take these kids on a school trip to America for a food tour
That one kid best stay there, we like our cornbread.
High schoolers? They look like middle schoolers
This is why the u s is the fattest country. Yes I'm american
You got to butter your cornbread to take some of the dryness out of it.
As someone who moved to America, I don’t recommend it anytime soon. Maybe in about 10 years, if we’re all still here. 😅
10 years from now you’ll look back and see that this sparked the UK’s bbq renaissance 😂😂
❤❤❤
That was TEXAS Barbecue, NOT Southern barbecue. In the South you have vinegar based, ketchup based, mayonnaise based, as well as mustard based sauces, you have pork shoulder, ribs, ham, whole hog, chicken, sausages, beef and even mutton/goat barbecue, some venison.  While Texas barbecue is prepared using the same techniques, the dry rub coating of salt and black pepper as well as the type of wood effects everything.     The wood burning emparts flavor that impacts the taste. Nortb Carolina mainly uses Hickory wood, Texas unless importing Hickory uses Oak and  Mesquite along with fruit woods like Apple or Cherry.  Unless you brought over a Southern cook the cornbread you served probably wasn't "real" cornbread.  Even in the South, cornbread can create arguments. The color of the cornmeal used, type of fat as well as liquid, adding sugar, or kennels of corn, adding jalapeños  or what is known as cracklings to the batter can create drama.    Cracklings are the  remains of rendering lard from pork fat.  Cut the non-cured pork fat into cubes between quarter and half inch thick.  Place cubes into pot with water that you heat to a simmer. As the water heats the lard liquefies and will float on top of the water and the flesh which held the fat will fry leaving tiny chunks of porky goodness that some with add the cornbread or corn muffins for a burst of flavor. Similar to pork skins but not exact.    Cornbread is usually served with butter, honey and leftovers are used crumbled into a bowl with either milk or buttermilk poured on for breakfast or snack.  Was common for both of my parents to do the next morning or even later that night.
Oh, they speeeaaak English. Lol
The snap on the sausage is the best part of the bite.
Monty and Freddie are hilarious 😭
The Headmaster has gotten trim!
Making us Texans proud! I'm hungry now...
Don't they have any female British high schoolers?
Headmaster is like, i need a vacation to Texas🎉
America is so fucking boring
Ahhh the twins all the boys have grown but look the same🥹 & their reactions are just as good  !!
My anger towards the awful haircuts was offset by the joy these kids were getting from a food I love. Thanks for the video!
Cornbread add Honey, or butter, or molasses on it.
I love these videos ❤
Bring Mr. Smith to America for a food tour! he'd be in heaven
hahah i really like the "i love this" kid, with the little headtilts back when he really likes it XD what a pure guy XD
The subtitles are off after the saily ad. I didn't understand anything said after that.
Excuse me? Well bless his heart. He said never make cornbread ever again 😂. In his defense there was no butter on it and THAT is criminal.
2:42 Trainspotting 3: love me some brisket
They keep getting younger.
The cornbread needs to have butter and honey/or maple syrup.
i love how the kids as Brits instinctively put the beans on toast (which is sort of the US peanut butter and jelly sandwich equivalent).....Americans are turning their heads like confused dogs about that...
Late to the game, but this has to be the "new generation".  The kidiots are the best ones to watch enjoying the food on offer.  The Celebs and chefs can take a back seat.  We want to see the unfiltered truth from the kids.
guys...can we get parents reaction to their kids please.
👍💕😂
Headmaster, Texas and Louisiana. Eat your heart out and thank me later!!
Last group wanted to go to Korea. This one wants to go to America
Not going to lie, hearing cornbread criticized huts my soul just a little. Sure, its not going to be the star on a BBQ plater, but still, it deserves its own recognition. These boys will never know the joy of hot buttered cornbread on a cold winter day paired with a big bowl of Midwest chili.
Whoop! As a Texan who loves this channel thank you for showing them Texas BBQ, not southern BBQ. Come on over anytime gentlemen, I would be honored to take y'all around. Young man, you can enter the military with parents permission here in the USA at 17. So moving here should be about the same, lol.
these kids have been deprived of flavor all their lives until this moment.
1:55 clearly they’re Africans not Brits
Merica!
I love cornbread, I’m from the South, obviously 😄😄😄
No, it isn’t a cup of tea. It’s a glass of iced tea. It’s a wonderful thing on a hot summer day in the South. Like today! It’s supposed to be 90F today — and that will be the lowest high for the next 12 days. Now, I’m off to have a glass. 🥵
They dont like these things like Mac and beans cause theyve never had it cooked right
At what age can you legally  move to America? Well played. Come on over...to the land of well fed immigrants. 😊
I love how every time I see one of these X group tries Texas bbq there is someone who mentions that now they understand why Americans are so fat. Not wrong my friend, you are not wrong.
All these kids are treasures. I hope their parents are proud of them.
No one would really appreciate corn bread on its own merits. It is a culturally grown cuisine that was always made out of necessity. The UK never had more corn than it knew what to do with so cornbread was never a thing
Love to see these food reactions, and Texas BBQ is fairly universal.  To be fair, corn bread when it’s warm and smeared with butter: it can’t compare to BBQ brisket.
These school videos are always worth watching. What great people.
see uk you don't have to eat like it's ww2 anymore
ALL THE YEARS of people tasting this kind of food, and loving it, yet England STILL doesn't make it. I don't get it.
The British students are my favorite video to watch
I wish these kids could come over and taste as much American food as they want and see what they think about it. They are so sweet and I love these type of vlogs guys . Kids will tell you what they think and I love that.Thanks so much for making us smile guys❤ Bring the headmaster he loves food!!
That wasn't very good corn bread if theu didn't like it. Plain and simple.
Why do some of the kids wear blue ties and others wear purple ties (and one with the yellow stripes)? Does the color designate the year?
You're going to overwhelm these kids with flavor I've seen people short circuit over the flavor of Texas BBQ
to be fair, the cornbread looked dry.  headmaster's looking hale, keep it up
Elizabeth turning in her royal grave
That's settled, I'm going to get a beef rib tonight
I needed this series back thank you ❤
Y'all needed to butter your cornbread. Or dip it in the beans/chili.
Cornbread can be a hit or miss. If it doesn't have enough sugar or butter then it can be bland and dry.
Trip to Portugal cancelled, rebooked to Texas 😂😂😂
These are my absolute favorite videos. I like how excited the kids get with all the new tastes. Barbecue is a great thing for them to be eating. ❤️
I absolutely LOVE the videos with these schoolboys. They're so honest and funny! And the headmaster NEVER disappoints! 😅
The kiddo saying cornbread tastes like paper...     Has he even TRIED A4????
I love how "So nice" is basically the British version of "Bussin Bussin"
they are right. its not a cup of tea. most of us call it a glass of tea, even if its in a cup
You should have hooked homie up with Mexican cornbread.
I admire how these kids and the headmaster are able to eat BBQ while keeping their shirts, ties, and jackets clean. I'd be covered with grease and sauce.
No wonder the British are so depressed, lil blonde dude got some cakey cornbread. Going to have to send you a mountain recipe.
Can British high schoolers go to america
한국시간으로 새벽 3시 42분에 보고 있는데 군침돌아서 참느랴 힘드네요.  넘 맛있어 보여요. 😋
To be fair, corn bread shines the brightest when hot, steaming, and full of melting butter. =:3
Love this channel and have massive repect for the young gentlemen involved in the tasteing. Its great honest entertainment thank you all involved luv ya x
6:33 You need more dinosaurs in the UK. Bigger bones, bigger meat.
That's why it's so easy to put on weight in the States , the foods just that good  and there's so so much more food this is only  scratching  the surface of it all
Please! Put some butter on that corn bread! Do it right, y’all! 😂
That's how you eat the corn bread with the meat by itself it's bland
What is the single most popular complaint that Jolly British people have about American food?       Too much flavor😢 Poor snowflakes.
Corn bread needs honey and butter
Somebody blew it on the cornbread!! It has to be sweet cornbread with butter.
Been waiting for this! 😂😂😂 the principal is my favorite 😂😂 he is always in love with all our food 😂
“You can really tell you’ve never eaten ribs before” hey hey hey, weren’t you the ones that had to be stopped by the restaurant owner for trying to eat ribs with a fork? 😂
I mean obviously it'll be hard to manage the time of filming and preparing of the food and all that but yeah I would say that's not the best looking food they have but I guess it's good enough for them to eat, thou there must've been someone who read the recipe wrong for that cornbread :(
2nd channel but it’s only the headmaster
Nahhhhh they didn’t have good cornbread if they didn’t like it 😂
This is so joyful. It's reaffirmed my faith in the younger generation.
So what school is this. Absolutely definitely not a comprehensive
13:40 This kid has got BEEF with cornbread
You’ve ruined them
These poor kids. Now have to go back to eating beans and toast.
I dont believe in cornbread without honey butter
"your the funny one." LMFAO.
I am willing to bet that corn bread was not true southern cornbread from South Carolina oh it is sweet soft heaven.
Too funny! Very surprised some didn't like the mac and cheese but if it's not freshly prepared and has to be reheated I can understand. As or cornbread again best served warm with butter and honey on it or take some of those beans and put them over the cornbread. Should have told the young man the sausage casing was a natural casing but explain what that is might put him off sausage forever. I'm not encouraged to have British food with the reactions to the abundance of flavor to me all food should have layers of flavor.
If you ate that everyday you would gain 200 lbs and develop high blood pressure and diabetes. So much fat and sodium. It's delicious but you cannot eat it every day and live for more than 10 years.
This is why I started watching this show I love watching these kids 🎉
I have been waiting for these bloody high schoolers for 2 months to try more American food 🥲
The only way to eat cornbread is with it lathers with butter on top, cinnamon butter if you wanna go even further beyond
Watching the video for the third time in a row. I would love to be able to eat that sort of food every day as well. Love your videos. The sweet tea was so light that it looked like it was half lemonade. You may want to double up on your tea bags as it should be a lot darker. I tried to post it on my phone without being logged in. We use 8 little tea bags for a gallon, but you can use 8-16. If we use a big tea bag we add a coupl of little ones. We pour a heaping cup of sugar to a cup and a half into a pan, and add the tea bags and some water and bring to a boil. Then we turn it off to cool. We pour it into a gallon jug and add more water and shake it up some and put it in the fridge. I bet the cornbread was a bit shocking if they were expecting it to taste like cake. I love brisket so much. Our local grocery store will have it for sell with a smoker out front and it is so good.
Would you die for Israel in trade for access to that??
I'm not going to say you guys screwed up the cornbread but judging by their reactions it wasn't very good.  Did you guys try it?  You've had Texas Cornbread so you'd be able to compare.  Corn Bread is a sacred thing to a lot of women out there, a lot of mama's, a lot of grandma's.  I can't help but think there would be 1000s of them saying "Should have tried mine" if they watched this.
Seeing this made this Texas Mama's heart so happy! 😂❤
I have never gotten so hungry watching a video 🤤
It’s the first time these poor British boys have experienced flavor in their lives… it’s beautiful.
Imo tri tip is way better than briskets, but I mean it is a lot work to make a brisket
Yeah you can’t eat cornbread just plain! Lol Put a bunch of butter on there!
what an entertaining bunch of kids! lol
Such tease from these students, just so funny with their reactions.  Cornbread and mac'cheeze the best.
12:46 I never even realized I’ve been eating on toast for that long till this video
I wish they would credit where they got the bbq from.  It looked amazing!
Thank you for making these videos. My day was already going quite good and this made it better. The sheer joy everyone is expressing is contagious.
Everything goes better with "Land of Hope and Glory".
Video gold you guys with the guys are going Galactic!
8:06 the kid is so smart!
Cooks were cooking something else before the shoot
That was one of the best episodes with the boys! Coming from a Southerner..💞
My wife and I have followed you for a minute. We were just saying how your channel has grown to the Arnold Schwarzenegger level. Out of all of your outstanding, well planned and inquisitive content, the content with these kids are our favorites. You (knowingly or not) are exposing a huge amount of viewers to cultures that they may never encounter. Love to you and yours.
i liteally am in texas right now trying it for the first time and this popped up on my feed as I was eating beef ribs for the first time
I drink cold flavoured teas every day. Today is Peach Tea. Yummm
As a Van life traveling nomad I search out BBQ from every state I go to, Dry and with sauce  it's all good I love my life
Kansas City BBQ > Texas BBQ.. Easily
It's so much fun seeing people try our Texas bbq for the first time. Next time, try buttermilk cornbread with jalapeños and cheddar cheese in the mix and lots of creamy butter.
I HEARD SOME BLASPHEMY!! GET THEM KIDS SOME PROPER MAC AND CHEESE AND CORNBREAD PLEASE I BEG 😭😭😭
I think with these kids, you may have planted the seeds for a major change in UK food culture.
As an a proud citizen of the USA, it makes me so sad that so many youtube series have endless videos of people from an entire region of the planet trying food that we eat on any random given saturday in our backyards, and they're amazed and BLOWN AWAY by it. Is it like, illegal to have good food in this part of the world? haha, boy am I glad for the boston tea party.
We need a seires with just Mr. Smith in Korea. Like the rappers seires.
If you visit the right places in America, they take their BBQ as serious as say a master brewer takes beer. The passion they have for it is unreal and the pit masters pride themselves on technique or different woods for different flavours. I've been blessed enough to eat this in America and it was an absolute eye opener.
That kids a weirdo for not liking cornbread and Mac n cheese
Where were you guys in 2007-2012😅
Let's keep these new kids going!! Bring on the KBBQ!!!! Bring back the soccer playeres too!! So Fun!!
they instantly grabbed the toast as soon as the beans came out lol
For you Brits who wonder why us Americans are overweight, it’s because our food tastes GOOD! 👍🏼
As a Texan, I am glad.that the British High-school boys enjoyed our Texas BBQ! 😋😋😋 If you (or anyone) ever comes to Texas in search of our authentic BBQ, avoid the johnny-come-lately nuveau places in Austin, etc., and instead go the historic capital of Texas BBQ in Lockhart Tx (Smitty's or Kreuz) or Central Market in Luling Tx. 😮😮😮 You won't be disappointed.  👍👍🔥😋😋😋😋😋😃
2:31 "Are you lyin'?" (takes a bite, eyes widen) "he ain't lyin'!" 🤣
So move to the UK with my smoker and i can become wealthy? 😂
Try moroccan cuisine next
3:28 it's called a foldie ❤
Good cornbread needs a thick layer of butter and a touch of honey.  I'm with the students who don't like the crunchy mac and cheese topping. Mom's homemade macaroni was awesome with a rich white cheese sauce.  My family believes velvita mac and cheese is the best boxed  kind.
THESE ARE ALWAYS THE BEST VIDEOS!! 🎉❤ And Texas BBQ wtf
Was the bbq cooked there? How did it get to England?
Y’all seriously need to collab with Off Menu. That would be amazing.
You guys might have actually broke the headmaster.
British people when they try actual flavor
Im hungry 😂
The complaining of cornbread being bland only to want mac and cheese to be more bland (when M&C being bland is the biggest issue with M&C to begin with + the texture which also got complained about) is wild
Texas has the best BBQ everything !!
Beautiful delicious animal base meat…Long Live Carnivores! 🥩👏🏻 YUM IN THE TUM!!!😋
Don’t dis our corn bread sir lol
I think all schools should give 10 kids that do the best a reward something like this *DROOL*
Mrs Smith is a lucky woman ❣
America just didn’t win this round. We’ve been wining against England the whole time. Let’s not forget the Revolutionary war to you guys the Independent war of America. We whoop y’all so don’t forget that EVER!!!
Bravo 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Sublime reactions to Texas bbq!! Forget Portugal, goto Texas!!!
Those eyes tell me everything! Texas 🤘🏽
Freddie Mercury Jr.
This is the one we've been waiting for 😅😅 American BBQ and the kid's from school in England and the headmaster
You need honey butter for the cornbread!!!
Headmaster Smith will annihilate his plate
"Ive never tried pickles".. this is why we need stricter immigration
Ok, the headmaster is INVITED to the BBQ😂😂😂😂😂
Why we don’t have briskets and ribs like that here in UK. Everyone loves it when they try it, instead we get kebabs here 🤢🤮 which ain’t even cheap
You tea looks way too watery. Google Milo’s Tea and you will see what our sweet tea looks like. It is much darker. We use 6 to 8 little tea bags and a heeping cup to a cup and half of sugar in a pan with water and bring it to a boil and turn it off and let it set to it cools and then pour it in a gallon jug and stir in enough water to make a gallon and put it in the fridge. I like mixing two brands of tea like Luzianne and Lipton.
Have them come here to South Carolina (Greenville) and we'll take care of these young men with tons of delicious vittles, great culture, and great people!!!
I usually order the burnt-tips as a meal.   😉
its a rarity if someone doesnt like it, I dont know anyone who doesnt like it here in the states
It wasn't in my plans but its definitely off to my favorite BBQ joint for dinner tonight! Yum!
The bark 😂
9:12 says one of the guys who was about to eat bbq ribs with a knife and fork before the waiter yelled at them to put down the cutlery.
They needed butter for the corn bread.
I just have to say… I know Josh Weismann said that but no one in Texas calls that a “Texas fold”. Just so you know lol
"What age can you pegally move to America?" You cant.. we dont want your ignorance here..
Ok but butter and honey needs to go with the cornbread 😂
I’m sorry but there’s no such thing as too cheesy lol. If it doesn’t stop you up for a week then there wasn’t enough cheese. 😂
Tell them how Heinz Beans is actually American 😂 I'd love to see the reactions.
"Why are Americans so fat" hmmm no idea
The headmaster summed it up with one sigh. Eating good BBQ is an experience that is joy in its purest culinary form. I've been waiting for this episode. Thanks, guys.
You gotta give them some butter on that cornbread! Or at least tell them to butter it after first bite if they don’t like it. Warm cornbread with melty butter is amazing… and how could they not like smoky pit beans!?! 🤯
We NEED Dave here in the US! 💕
Subtitles are out of sync for most of the video.  Looks like maybe they moved the sponsor bit up from where it originally was and forgot to correct the subs.
😂 I BLOODY ❤IT !!  😂  From West Virginia Appalachia 🎉
Gave a bunch of kids the best meal of their life at age 12, you monsters. They'll never reach the same culinary highs for the rest of their life.
This is always so much fun. Love the headmaster, kids are awesome.
Where did you get this food in the UK!?!! 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Portugal? The headmaster needs to go to America!
Half of a can of cream corn, butter, and honey are a MUST for cornbread.
Feed some girls!
Racially segregated BBQ.
You need to bring these high-schooler to the USA to experience the USA culture, Bull riding, American Football games, southern Food, the beautiful views and the long ass road trip to experience how big USA is lol 😂
SO HEARTWARMING somehow to watch foreigners sincere reactions.
Elder Texan here.  (mid-50s)  Sweet tea is an abomination.  From what I gather it infiltrated Texas from southern restaurant chains like PoFolks, Grandys, and Chick-Fil-A.  Through even the 80s in the Greater Houston area, restaurants did not serve sweet tea.  Do I hate it, no.  The problem is that it is not a thirst quencher.  The more I drink, the thirstier I get.  When it comes to BBQ, you really need something to cut through the weight of that fatty meat.  Bread, onions, pickles, and unsweet tea; or beer. (tea with lemon is okay)
It looks like an opportunity was missed to mix the beans with some sausage slices and cornbread.
Brits are SOOOOOOo ignorant to good food
You are supposed to put a little butter and warm honey over the corn bread it makes it less dry and gives it a really good sweetness.
My grandparents make this thing they call Mexican cornbread and in my opinion its way better then normal
This makes me truly feel for third world countries that don't have the means to make decent tasting food. Like England.
🤠🤘🏽
Cornbread can be hit, or miss......but NEVER leave out the creamed corn!!!
The mac & cheese you want it to be more bland lol!
Ok the eng subs are messed guys. Seems like they didnt insert subs for the sponser
These kids have always been nice over all these years, but the culture starts at the top.  ANY kids with a headmaster this human can only benefit.  Just such a nice, likeable guy, these kids get such a good start in life
Hello Jolly Team, the captions kinda timed wrongly since the ad in between~ enjoying the ep still🍖🥩
Honestly guys you need to bring the headmaster with you on your next visit, I think he’ll runaway and never return to the UK
I hate cornbread so high five to the lad that agrees. Dirty sand cake blech
When you asked the headmaster if he was going on holiday and said you had a treat for him I audibly said "they're finally taking him" unfortunately I was wrong :(
Best way   to  eat corn bread is  hot  and with butter   my favorite is sweet cornbread with   minced onions and jalepeno  pepper  baked  in    and     butter
The flavor will live in your memory for the rest of your life! You’ll NEVER stop craving it! ❤
Got to get them to try all the deserts next
Oh my gosh, kids!  We need a blind folded edition so they can't see what they're eating, kind of like hiding vegetables in kids food & not telling them, no preconceived feelings!
So, it boils down to “too much flavor”. I almost had a heart attack at wanting mac n cheese to be bland: 🤦🏽‍♀️
I hope the sausage was at least a day old, smoked sausage is always best on the second day.
8:26 that kid is brilliant at describing. 😊
I had to watch it 2times and cried laughing
Best one yet
I live in Houston, Texas, and it's awesome seeing kids who've never had good barbecue, try it for the first time.
Naw, Y'all are eating the cornbread wrong. It needs to have a gob of butter on it! mmmmm, everything looks so good! I believe the youngest boys are having a religious experience, especially the chap on the left.
ALRIGHT BRITS!!! Go ahead and crack on us Yankees for our gluttony.... But NOW YOU KNOW and there is NO DENYING HOW GOOD IT IS!
13:42 this child is going to need the 5 Secret Cornbread Recipes of Nebraska
Everything is bigger in Texas... as we like to say! 😊
To be fair on the cornbread it did not have any butter or honey so I feel exactly how they would feel.
As an American I do love barbecue it’s amazing St Louis and Texas are the best barbecue and also some Cornbread is better than others it really depends on the recipe some is sweeter some more bland
This was great! Thank you, from the Lone Star State! 🤠
2:50 I think this kid gets your job now. Ollie. It’s like some ancient feudal law or something 😂
You need butter on that cornbread!! 🧈
When you hear the words 'burnt ends' you are so not ready for what you're about to eat.
You guys have to take the headmaster to the U S.
Or cornbread with green chilies!! YUM!!! That's how we eat it in AZ!!! And honey butter!!!! Savory & sweet!!! ❤😊
All the reactions are just making me think of Oliver Twist having his first experience outside the workhouse 😅
Total gold.
England tells Americans we have no culture. We do have culture, it is different from England's, that is all.
These kids are so cute! Love seeing them enjoying their food.
Lol i wonder if they had southern still cornbread would they feel the same about it
I'm from Arizona I love when you guys do these videos. It is amazing to me that so many of the kids have never tried brisket or ribs. We have a few places here in Phoenix that sells exactly what you guys were showing at oh my God the meat is so good. Keep up the good work guys. Kregg from Phoenix
"Tastes like steak, but smoky." Yeah, that's called "barbecue", kid 😂 If your BBQ isn't smoked or at least charcoal-cooked for that smoky goodness, you're doing it wrong 😂  Did you give them bad cornbread? A good cornbread should be sweet; if they're saying it's bland, something is wrong.
6 Beef ribs (Honey smoke glazed) And a pitcher of beer with sides (Coleslaw, Mac salad Bread slices) $25 - Those were the days Back then after working 12 hrs in the mines The wife always wondered why i went right to bed lol
Where did they get the food from?
Its difficult to watch people eat bbq when you don’t have bbq yourself.
that one british kid just discovered flavor 😭😭
I clicked on this so fast and was not disappointed lol
Headmaster Smith:  “oh I like sausages” 😂 love it  Give that boy some honey butter for his cornbread sir!
How do you get the American food in UK? Especially fast food not in the UK? Do you guys have a cook? I've always wondered.
"You're a funny one" just made me laughed so hard 😂😂😂
Beans and cornbread not on toast!
Probably my favorite school episode you all have done yet! This was great to watch their reactions ...the cherry on top was watching them all instinctively put their beans on the bread, Brits & their beans on toast (shaking my head) Lol, hilarious.
You should put butter on the corn bread and please don't put those beans on toast! 😂
new Jolly series taking the highschoolers to the USA🤣
Headmaster licked his fingers!!! 😂😂😂
Make Texas BBQ Great Again!
These are the best. Sharing new foods with genuine responses.
The little kid that said never make cornbread again knows we have gigantic trailer parks in the south and all 60 million children, and that’s just one trailer park, will whoop your ass while the parents bet on which kid knocks him out first…. Right?   2 wars fighting yall, 2 wars saving yall… we take fighting pretty seriously in America especially the south. God blessed Dixie.
Is the BBQ from Texas or is it from a restaurant in England?
The headmaster shouldn't be going on holiday to Portugal.  He should be going on holiday in the US!
More spices in one meal than the average Brit gets in their entire lifetime.
This is the penultimate episode of this. We’ve peaked.  As a french canadian, Texas BBQ is the best food I’ve ever had in my life. It’s crazy that pretty much only Texas does this, or has it so culturally significant at least, given how incredible it is.
Brought tears to my eyes...so heartwarming to see our barbecue enriching taste buds over the pond! The boys are so adorable, nothing like a good meal being appreciated and tasting flavors from different cultures!
1:13 did the kid on the right say he'd rather go to Maccies aka McDonalds? O_O Edit: At least he came to his senses after tasting lol 3:40 the voice change from just a year ago. Man, cornbread is amazing with some butter and strawberry jelly on it or honey and butter. It combats that extremely dry texture of it.
Maybe this cornbread was cooked badly. Godo cornbread is yummy
Im jealous of these young men.
The subs are not synced up right
Maybe they’re starting to understand why Americans are so overweight
You all need to take principle and high schoolers on a trip here to experience college football and tailgating along with the food they’ll enjoy it
It’s hard to explain American BBQ to anyone when we say we cook meat with a wood or coal fire for long periods of time. People think, “Yeah, that’s basically the same as what we do.” In reality, it is so very different. Always serve your Cornbread with butter and make sure it’s a sweet cornbread. Your sweet tea looked wrong. It should be almost as dark as the bbq sauce, so the ratio is off. 🫶👍
And just like that...I'm off to find some BBQ
i missed this so much:)
Taking some of the kids to different late night spots to eat in NYC would be a great vid. Seeing the lads around NYC at night, something the likely not be able to do outside of something like Jolly, would be awesome
This makes me proud to be an American
makes your tongue slap your brains out
lol “ You’re the funny one “ 😂😂😂😂
Please do authentic Mexican food next!
Bro the other students must get so jealous……
This is why we are all fat in the U.S.  All of our food is just outstanding.
As a Texan … I think I need some smoky brisket for dinner ❤❤❤
I'm curious about the "Texas fold".  I was born in Texas and have lived in 15 different towns in Texas in the last 70 years and never saw anyone do this or heard the term used??
Yeah texas kinda be missin on the cornbread. Go a lil more north if you want the good cornbread
You guys should visit Mr. H and Friends...
thats american bbq no such thing as southern u can find that in about everystate. steak fat isnt chewey its the same as if u bbq. if its chewey somebody screwed up.not a texas fold called a brisket sandwich.
I imagine the tribe on north sentinel island would have the same reaction to electricity
They need to do a foodie tour of Texas with the Head Master!
Worst part of it all is the children being exposed to this amazing food, only to go back to British cafeteria food afterwards😢
As an American,  who loves all barbecues, this was such a joy to watch. The Texas barbecue sampling coupled with Elgar and Handel's music was brilliant with a capital "B"!! Love your videos, keep them coming!! ❤❤❤
Now this video was fun! Watching those proper, well behaved boys come face to face with BBQ and cut loose with abandon made me laugh.
Wasn't this video already made before?
I'm with another subscriber..... take the Headmaster and 2 lucky boys (raffling the trip, of course) on your next Texas or BBQ trip.  And remember, we're all jolly, but there is only one "funny one".  🎉🎉
It’s hilarious seeing the children be so very wrong about how wonderful pit beans are
How do you get this great food to the UK?
They taste combo of fat, spices, and new real flavor
That cornbread... when they picked it up, it FELL APART!!! That was disappointing. I hope they get to try a better version that sticks together.
Headmaster was in heaven
This children… is why the American’s fought the crown in 1776.
Poor Brits, having to eat British food every day.  No wonder they went crazy over Texas Barbecue.
Much like biscuits, cornbread is primarily a Southern thing and can be very polarizing.  The only kind that I like comes from a box mix sold at Trader Joe's.
Cornbread needs honey
Could u maybe try doing the same kinda thing in a college or uni?
As an American born and raised in Southwest Detroit...... I must admit bbq brisket is 1 of my favorites!!!!
Where's the texas twinkies?
Extra sloppy
Where did the food come from? Did you bring a chef? Give credit to the cook!
They ate the worst stuff last
Bring the headmaster on a tour to America pls 😭😭 he deserves to fangirl with you guys about American food~
You've given them probably one of the messiest thing to eat, and there is hardly a napkin on the table!
Beans on bread.  Beam me up, Scotty.  Exponentiated carbs. Next time maybe some Texas chili.  And tea is dishwater.  What they need here is a bottle of Lone Star beer (or some local brew from Texas).  Then you get the full effect of the mean, I believe.
THE CAST IS BACK!
Add some butter on that cornbread - yummy scrumptious!  Add a pinch of sugar when mixing for a sweet hint.
HEADMASTER USA TOUR
EDIT: Thanks for fixing The editing for the video does not seem to line up with the editing on the subtitles.  The subtitles skip over the integrated ad so they are way ahead of what's actually happening on the screen starting around 5:04 and then the subtitles for the commercial start at 7:27 and then everything syncs back up at 8:31.
This fills my big ol Texan heart with Joy! 😊💖
Makes me happy when others enjoy our food.
Bake the cornbread with a can of cream style corn, the butter and honey. You're welcome.
Been wanting to see this done ever since the biscuits and gravy episode. ;)
Cornbread is supposed to be buttered and honeyed.
Brits experiencing proper flavor for the first time always brings a tear to my eye
Note to self Brit's don't like cheese??? 😂😂😂
As a heads up, the captions proceed with the normal video during the sponsored segment, so it ends up mistimed for the rest of the video.
I love how Dave is just absolutely enjoying himself with this! BBQ does that to a man, it's so good!
I WILL STOP MAKING CORN BREAD WHEN YOU STOP PUTTING TUNA IN BAKED POTATOES!
I honestly think US Southern BBQ beats every countries #1 type of cuisine
I love when you do these video with the school age boys!  Their comments are so honest-and funny!
Burnt Ends? Ain't that the the rough part of town?
Betcha those guys took a fat nap right after eating the BBQ
So lucky I live in Texas never knew people didn’t know this type of food because in Texas it’s like regular to eat food like this 😂
Hell yeah I've been waiting for this as a fellow Texan I absolutely love this video
Anyone notice the AI icons used?
hi to whoever made the subtitles !! the sponsor segment messed it up, pls fix
It's always American food. No other country in the world exists outside the UK. Nothing to do with the potential clicks on the video.....
them wanting the mac and cheese more bland 😆
Its not called a Texas fold. Stop it. Making us look bad with that california nonsense.
Please take the headmaster to America
Mr. Smith getting to go through another "highschoolers try" series 😂 such a lucky man
Ollie has no place to talk about bad analogies.😅
I bet the students and headmaster get excited when they hear Jolly are coming to visit and offer some new meal. The school cafeteria can be hit or miss at times.
This, again, is fantastic! The statements & quips that everyone is using are hilarious & definitely funny. Thanks for sharing! =)
You've gotta have honey on cornbread, otherwise it's too dry.
You guys really, really need to take Headmaster Dave on a food tour of the US!
For the love of all that is holy, put some butter on that damn cornbread!
I'm from the South and I don't like cornbread either. But everything else... yum!
Dear British people ❤ All you need to invest in to have all this whenever you want is a Traeger grill. And the wood pellets it uses. Or a wood pellet maker if you want to make your own. The Traeger is super easy to use, basically fool proof. You can monitor your meats or whatever your smoking from your phone. Just imagine what you could charge your neighbors for food like this 😅
Clearly the cornbread was bad because good cornbread is one of the best foods. Like a good piece of cornbread with that really thick butter, especially if its maple butter, is incredible.
How is the Nigerian an ethnic Brit?
Can be life changing!
There must have been $600 worth of bbq
And now they have to go back to eating beans on toast, and porridge under a bleak English sky, poor chaps.
Time for headmaster Dave to come to Texas with Josh and Ollie!!
Who prepared it for them?
Who made the food?!?!
they're all honorary Texans now.
Just curious, did they buy this food in the US and then prep it there?
“Don’t ever make cornbread again”   Look here young buck, ILL FIGHT A KID! 😂
"I'm still comprehending the flavors." So sweet these kids!
Always good to see the British finally taste good food.
Another outstanding video! Love these Fulham boys and Mr. Smith. But where was the honey and butter for the Southern cornbread?
That cornbread looked like some serious mid, ngl - A Texan
As a southerner, I love watching people react to southern bbq! You should also have Koreans react to Texas BBQ on your other channel!! Now that I live in China, my favorite thing to do is cook BBQ and southern foods for Chinese people and watch as they realize that fast food isn’t the only good American food lol.
Despite 77 million of us Americans being utter morons (MAGA), we do know our BBQ😂 P.S. dont ever serve cornbread without butter or honey butter. It's just disrespectful 😂
These kids are being raised right in the world of food.
This was fun so happy they liked our barbecue ❤😊
I love how British the boys are. 😂 Every reaction/statement they make cracks me up. Glad, but not surprised, that they like our food though!
It's so funny watching them trying to say two or three words between taking chomps out of pork ribs!
The sweet tea is where the goodwill ended.
9:16 Says the guys who tried to use a fork and knife.
British palette is so bland that they cant comprehend the flavors of Texas BBQ 😭😭😭
Gotta put cinnamon butter on that cornbread!
I can imagine those boys taking a group trip to Texas when they're 18 as Jolly had taken some students to South Korea.
They are teaching these kids to have expensive food habits, now they will be thinking about getting BBQ as often as they can.  There are some places there in the UK so it's not like they can't find some, i am sure they would love to go to someplace like Texas too but that is a bit of a stretch save for if they save up to go on vacation or "holiday" as many call it.  If they go to Texas or not at least they have been opened up to a new whole new category of food that they will be able to find some places in the UK if they like.
Humanity can all come together with food.  PS: they NEED to Yell: CAPTAIN CAVE MAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNN !!!!!!!!
Uni students tour of the southern states ??
What an upgrade ollie , from the Idiot to the funny one 😁😁
I unsubscribe because of the cornbread comment
That boy said it right. Go big or go home. I think all Americans go by that motto
Shoulda gave them some chili with that corn bread...
8:27 Ollie you would know a thing or two about horrible analogies
Beans...and pit. You win, good sir.
those two and the pickles... "i'm not really a fan of beans" "I can tell by the single bean on your fork."
For goodness' sake, butter the cornbread.
Only a natural casing (membrane from intestines, usually pig) gives snausages that crisp snap.
I love how they keep saying America, America, America.. not knowing Texas is it's own country 😂😂😂
food coma finna go crazy😂
The ribs and the brisket and the toast and slaw and some fries and beans and
For you Brits, in America, there’s so many different flavors of mac and cheese but two main styles. Gooey where it’s just the noodles and cheese or baked mac and cheese which usually has the crispy top. Both styles are well loved here in America. Depending on your preference, the type of cheeses used can add a lot of flavors to the dish. Josh and Ollie, you guys have got to bring Dave on a bbq tour of the south.
I’m just so blown away by these kids that have never had a rib and never tasted all the things I’ve grown up on. I’m in Oklahoma.
Bring the kids on a field trip to the ranch y'all went to and film them learning how to work and cook please!
Take Dave and his wife on a Jolly American Tour
anyone who disgraces Mac n' Cheese... you're not to be trusted!! 😂
Bring headmaster to America!
Where was this food cooked? Was it reheated?
“… it’s like eating a crouton.”😂😂
Need butter on the corn bread
Sounds really good I haven't tried those too
It's like every bite is blowing Harry's mind; little man's havin' his best day ever. 😂  EDIT: Ok, maybe not the beans. lol
I’m glad it was Texas for their first try!
I’m with the dude who doesn’t like the crusty bit on top of Mac and cheese. I hate that part! I love cheese, but still hate that part.
I love that the first impulse is to put the pit beans onto bread. No lads, just spoon them up and eat them - no bread/toast required.
As a Texan that's what I call an sad attempt at Texas BBQ. Also I wish they stopped making things up. They need real Texas BBQ
You don’t eat cornbread alone, gotta add salted butter and honey!
Taking Headmaster Dave to America when, boys?
I love Dave so much, at this point he will never say no to them coming to feed the kids because he wants to eat more than anyone.
Another fucking America related post unsubscribing from this channel will just watch Korean Englishmen those videos are actually entertaining.
……I’m hungry.
First time these kids have had a proper meal!
You wanted it to be more bland?....  Yes. 😂💀
How many likes do we have to get for a British HeadMaster tours Southern US BBQ series ?
They’re going to catch the Itis 😂😂
Andnthis is why we got the best food
The subtitles timing starting at the sponsored ad is messed up 😂
I come back to these just for Mr. Smith lol
It’s kinda odd watching the boys have their first “food O”. 😂😂😂
All the Brits experiencing flavor for the first time brings a tear to my American eye 🥹
Cornbread tastes better with softened butter. I add applesauce to my cornbread batter to make it more moist
Love these vlogs with the students.  They are hilarious and so mature for their ages.  But my favourite is the headmaster with his extra genuine reactions - he loves EVERYTHING!!
This Kansas city gal is happy 😊 😁
My favorite category of shows the headmaster and school kids!  Thanks
Not better than “British baked beans” lmaooooooo you mean hienz from a can thrown into the microwave and then onto a “jacket potato” 😂
I’m from Texas and have never had Texas bbq 😨
Theres no way it was sweet cornbread they're hating on 🤣
Can you do a video with Ed Currie and try Pepper X, please 🙏🏻
They are back!!! Love this series! 😃😄👑🔥😁
I do like this series
YEEHAW & YUMMY!!!
I trust Jolly knows good TX bbq after all these years but the meat actually falling off the bone of that beef rib hurt me. I'm sure its still amazing, but its supposed to still be attached to the bone and give with a little pull. I know this is crazy levels of anal, but jolly has been to the greatest tx bbq places in the world and NONE of them fell off the bone completely like that.
The captions are way off
As an American, I appreciate the fact that you started them with Burnt Ends. Well done👍 hard to live up to from then on out tho lol
The ties the students wear   Is there a meaning to the colors.
Finally the kids are back!  They are adorable. We've been waiting for this.
They were supposed to butter the cornbread. I cut it in two and put butter in between.  Warm cornbread with butter- yum.
Those boys are gonna be so sleepy when they get back to class. 😂  Great video Jolly❤
I'm with the Brits on corn bread - not a fan. And I live in the South!
These dudes had more flavor in this video than their whole lives
This is the episode we've been waiting on lol.  Bring Mr Smith to America with you!!!
As a Texan, this is so satisfying and brings such happiness. Texans really love each other though food and seeing each one of them enjoy this so much is really great. I hope we can make the world a little bit better one brisket at a time. God bless Texas
It's funny cuz Brits think that we don't know how to use a knife and a fork but these guys don't know how to eat with their hands.
Yeah and if you ate this everday you'd be a fatzilla.
Yeah I'm 38 and still don't like cornbread
School in my day was the cane and flying erasers! this looks a tad nicer!!
Its almost like they don't know how to eat the ribs 😂 please take the headmaster for a tour, he will definitely gain a few lbs
This whole channel is just pandering to Americans, why don't you try some different food for a change rather than 'Two Brits try American food for the first time *shocked faces in thumbnail*' for every video
the headmaster, mr. smith, is probably thanking any and all gods for having met josh and olly back in university. not only have they been great friends since, they have opened up a whole new world to him and his students.
Texan here. I need to explore more BBQ places. You take it for granted when it's down the road. I'm with the kids who say the pork ribs are the best. All of this is good, but there's something about the flavor of pork ribs!
Cornbread is even better when slathered with butter. :)
So do they take TX BBQ to Britain or do they take Britons to the TX BBQ? Since they are in a school I assume they take the BBQ to Britain. Either option doesn't sound very practical but I guess with 4+ million subs anything is possible lol
You need to slather that cornbread with butter and honey
That cornbread did look dry. I probably wouldn't like it either. I make mine moister and add cheese and jalapeños.
Cornbread hating boy was a tough sell.  I'd hate to have to cook for him lol.
Haha them kids were doin WORK on that food! Goin so hard they're sweating 🤣
Just came back from a trip to texas, went to terry blacks because of your video, also had BBQ in houston (Truth BBQ), everything was AMAZING
I am going to need a behind the scenes video on how you achieved this!!!
"You're the funny one." You shouldn't be surprised he learned so quickly, Ollie. This IS a learning institution!
Jolly. Years and years of spending way too much time with high school boys.
"Too much texture" is a new one
Is it weird to say that I missed Dave?? 😂😅
...."it's like cucumber but better"...who's telling him?? 😂
These poor kids have never had great food clearly lol
Is there a reason you guys don’t ever bring food to a girls school? I think they’d also love to try these foods.
Who made that brisket??? Tell me it was Josh or Gabi! Maybe Papa Weissman when he was in the UK? That's a dang good looking brisket! Nice and juicy, tender, bark looks great too! And I'll make that kid some cornbread he'll be begging for it to never run out!
How are you able to get the food there fresh?  Always been curious about that.
Is it just me or does, Mack look like a younger Brad Pitt 😂 Also the headmaster is the  goat 🐐🗿
Ohhhh, I’m so glad you gave them some true Texas barbeque!!!
Who does the cooking to bring this delish meal to the school? Their reactions are always so fun to watch! 😁
Too much flavor for these kids
I felt I got stabbed when that kid said, "Don't ever make cornbread again." How dare you
Taste palette is SHOT when you say store bought canned beans are better than homemade beans😂😂😂😂
If you can watch this video without smiling then congratulations you're dead.
Please do one with the cab drivers. I bet they'll love it!
So random to see Olly wearing a Mammoth Mountain shirt!
How do these kids go home and eat dinner with their families after this?
Glad you liked it boys. Rock on! 🙏❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏
From Texas here, I love yall Brits but I do feel bad for your taste buds lol
They are going to sleep good.
They need to bring the students to the u.s I wanna see them eat gator 😂
Mr. Smith NEEDS to go on the next Jolly trip to America.
"im all for the ride" ... truer words could not have been spoken when it comes to food
American food is stealing the hearts of the British.  I hope you vacation in America and stay! 😂
What ever happened to Rory, Theo, Lorenzo, Max and the regular guys there was never a conclusion have they left or taking exams?  you took the previous lads to South Korea where as these haven't even got a Goodbye. I got so used to seeing them and their different personalities Rory with his wise cracks, Max complaining about the spice, Theo sneaking another bite I just cant get used to these Newbies!
Do they bring in a pitmaster from Texas? Or, like, fly it in a cooler? Or just fake it?
This is the only time I’d accept beans on toast😂
P.S. Ya'll should take the boys to the U.S., let 'em try our Real Southern BBQ and soul food! Also, do a "redemption round" and take some OUR American students to England and Korea too!
You guys need to take the principal with you next time you come to the States
I love how all the kids put the beans on the bread. Definitely a British thing! 😂
I love how the kids have 0 issue going in with their hands. No reprimand for them.
These kids are trying something they have NEVER had .......seasoning.
Imma send that one kid 500lbs of cornbread and make him regret saying to never make it again xD
New fan favorite. They are adorable..
Principal letting his rough past show there 😂 Everything is better with bread in'it? 😂
How are they getting fresh American BBQ to the yougins in the uk? Is there a BBQ joint over there run by an American?
This is the first time jolly mess up the english subtitle.  😂😂
Y’all need to eat your cornbread with butter and honey! So yummy!
Would it be a good idea to say that the cornbreads deserved another chance because I saw many people in the comments here said that they needed buttered like a lot in order for them to reach their fullest potentials?
Bbq is really life changing. Bless them lol
It’s an emotional experience. The Fred Flintstone ribs are the best. The cornbread needs butter!
If I could get my 9th generation Texan wife to move to England we could make a fortune with a little bbq shack.
Note to all the people in the UK. YOU NEVER EAT CORNBREAD WITHOUT BUTTER ON IT.   Cornbread is dry, so you have to cover it in butter, remember that. Every time I see a British person eat cornbread, they never put butter on it. I want to yell through the screen and tell them to get the butter, and a lot of it.
Add Texas smoked brisket to the Sunday Roast protein lineup! 🤤
Honestly I've had dozens of varieties of cornbread just because I'm adventurous and like staying optimistic, but never in my life have I ever had it and genuinely enjoyed it. I always try it then put it back down and won't touch it again. It's literally just compacted thick sand with some whisper of a faint flavor of something 😂
I'm so glad these kids got to experience Texas BBQ.
The cornbread getting lost in translation was funny, since Josh and Olly don't seem to know you often need some butter and maybe some honey on your cornbread.
Put BUTTER on the corn bread
No Banana pudding?? 🤔 Or dessert (pecan pie for me). Disservice to these kids lol. As an American I always love watching these videos and their reactions of our great food for the first time! 😊🇺🇸. Keep it up 👍.
I'll just say what we're all wanting in hopes that the more they see it, the higher chance it'll happen TAKE. DAVE. TO. TEXAS. Really they should take him to many of the places they've been (Memphis, Nashville, NYC, Savannah, New Orleans, etc.), but that's pricey and a lot of travel to places they already have been, so if they can only do one, Texas (I personally hope to see him a Terry Black's but Goldee's would work too)
You can see the food comas starting 😂
The headmaster's reaction is always my favorite....please bring him to America next time, he'd be a blast to watch.
You have to put butter on the cornbread!  And they need to try the brisket with the barbecue sauce  Where was the cobbler?
It almost broke my heart seeing those kids put those wonderful smoked baked beans on the bread. It's like eating a taco from the middle. It's just not done. Not with American baked beans.
Lessggooooo
Wow, Monty and Freddie sooo grown up😲🤯 Also Jahsiah and David 😃
As a Texan 🤠 this episode warms my heart! 💜 Sweet corn that’s fresh is what gives cornbread its authentic flavor and moistness; unfortunately not all cornbread is made with it.  Some only use cornmeal. Try homemade cornbread made with fresh sweet corn sometime served warm with melted butter for a final verdict! 🌽😃 Thank you for this amazing episode!
It’s always curious to me how divisive beans can be. And it almost seems like it usually comes down to a texture rather than flavor.
Testing school food from America
American BBQ has no equal. That primal inner hunter gatherer rises up through you at first bite. Meat and smoke is pure magic.
Agreed with the mac and cheese bit. Do not bake my goddamn mac and cheese.  That's the quickest way to ruin a good mac and cheese. All that does is dry it out.
Thing is with these videos is Americans watch this probably think we dont have any foods like this here in the UK 😂😂
If it isn't sweet corn bread, you need to put some unsalted butter and honey on it.  And where are the grilled beans?  You got the pit beans but no grilled beans.
This is great! Can we help fun the headmaster's trip to go to Texas and you guy just film him trying all the great spots there?
It's so cool that you give these kids these experiences! I wish I'd had an experience like this in highschool!😊
I call into question the quality and flavor profile of the cornbread. Sweet cornbread vs your grandmas cornbread some the depression 🤣
Generic cornbread is super dry. Night and day if you make it right.
Time for a road trip to the American South with the students and principal in tow!  😊
Yess. I wanted the headmaster to eat these!
These are their best videos.  Love the reactions.
I just wait for these episodes with the kids. So great.
I always enjoy watching Young English men enjoy southern cooking, especially Texas BBQ
To a person they all put the beans on bread. Americans would just eat them from the bowl.
after all that, the Brits in them still says "southern tea is not proper tea" and that will never change 😅
Cornbread needs butter at least, honey makes it all that much better
6:11 Pomp and Circumstance being played 😂
I love the Head Master ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
Give the British kids beans and they immediately put them on toast….😂
YouTube's captions in the middle of the video are way off.  Great video, though!
So entertaining!
I wonder how they pick which kids get to participate. Also this headmaster is always the best.
I hate to say it, but the fat is the best part for me. When it’s been slow cooked on a brisket or on a grilled ribeye steak where it just melts in your mouth like cotton candy, dear God. No way I can be vegetarian.
"Are you lying!..." "He's not lying"
Heinz are D-tier baked beans
It's nearly a quarter of an hour of people having religious experiences with food!  Love it!😆
"Never make cornbread, again." Ouch, that hurt.
you said you were going to give the teacher a gift but didnt give him anything...
American here ... To be fair - not all cornbreads are created equal. I don't particularly like regular (plainly made) cornbread for this very reason - it's often too dry or gritty, or too sticky & sweet (some add extra creamed corn to their plain recipe, which may or may not have added sugar in it). The dry cornbreads are better enjoyed topped with extra butter and honey - it's the only way to save it, and it's delicious - but then it's like entering sweet bread/cake territory, and if you're not in the mood for sweet, it doesn't register as delicious.  The best cornbreads walk the savory-sweet line, by adding extra whole corn, cheese, sometimes jalapenos, or even a minced meat and sauce mixture (canned Manwhich is a cheap easy add-in for midwesterners). The extra flavors contrast and highlight the cornbread flavor itself, making it more delicious that way... Or I'm just picky! I don't know😅...but I get it, though, about not liking plain cornbread right off the bat. It's usually better as a platform to dump some chili beans on, and eat it that way!
Im from TEXAS corn bread is NOT really a bread to eat seperate ONLY if it is MEXICAN corn bread....But the cornbread is to be eaten with or mixed into BEANS more so
Wait till they try cornbread with honey butter!
Wots all this then?
Jalapeño cornbread is where it’s at
*Mr Smith goes to America*
Cornbread can easily be hit or miss.. it can be dry and bland sometimes. I like it with Chili or Baked Beans. Something you can dunk it in .
Yes, cornbread tends to be dry and bland. Eat it with butter and honey. Much better!😀
BUTTER!  You need butter on the cornbread
Don't mind me eating my spinach salad lunch while enviously watching a bunch of high schooler eating a tray full of meat. (Finishes salad and moves on to my bowl of yogurt) I am not jealous at all. (Single tear runs down my face) 😢
That brisket is looking rough. All that yellow fat? Nasty.
Harry's little voice is adorable!
Tell jr. there im coming for him 🤨 ......with CORN BREAD
The headmaster found a new religion in the BBQ
I watched this twice in a row. When are you bringing the boys to the US. You did South Korea. You owe America this. ❤❤❤
It does look like a bad, dry, cornbread - From San Antonio, Texas USA. Everything else looks spot on. Fatty brisket side looked good too, lean not enough smoke ring
Headmaster is the goat 🐐You should bring him to the States some day!
"thats not tea"...correct its sugar with a bit of coloring (and I'm in Texas)
We southerners will stop making cornbread as soon you stop making beans on toast.
Texas BBQ is the best in the world.  I will take no questions.
The boys did quite well trying new foods and foods they normally don't like.  The cornbread did look dry. It really needed either butter or honey butter. The meat looked fantastic.
I also like cor🤢…. corn 🤢…… br🤢…brea🤢🤢…bread
Now's a bad time to go to the USA. 😬
Yo, them cornbread comments is fightin words. But yeah sometimes it can be a little dry. That’s why you gotta butter em up or dunk em in something.
Great reactions! 🤣👍 Just one pointer. The slaw is to cut the fattiness of the meat. Cornbread is never eaten dry. Lol. It must be warm with butter and / or honey on top. A little of both is best. 👍 Amazing!
I love watching the boys try American food 😊
I need my cornbread buttered, and  I like to put maple syrup on top. Otherwise yes it's horribly dry.
Headmaster is lookin good 👍
Speaking as a native Texan, their reaction to the BBQ fills me with pride.
Laughed my arse off at this bit 11:39
You've ruined "Sunday Roast" for those boys forever. 😉 " Mum, did you slow cook this for 16 hours...?"
Immediately putting beans on the bread is so British!!😂😂
Ok, change in my day plans... I'm going to get some brisket! Thank goodness I have a Texas BB!Q nearby.
Where's Theo? He was so funny
You need butter for the cornbread
ollie with the mammoth mtn shirt represent
Butter and gravy on cornbread
As an American with family from the south they LOVEEE cornbread I’ve never liked it too dry and bland surprisingly the Brit’s don’t lol
Great video guys!!
This is worth Britain losing the American colonies in the revolution.....you can see it in their eyes. 😂
That Harry kid was having a literal religious experience! Boys if you ever want to come to central Texas you are welcome here at my house anytime! Glad to see our Texas BBQ bringing joy across the pond. You should also have them try Memphis style BBQ dry rub. There is a famous place in Memphis called Rendezvous and they are famous for their dry rub. You can order it online and im sure you could get them to ship it
Ollie saying someone else is making a horrible analogy? Really?
My only complaint is about the beef rib, they left the silver skin on
😂Tastebuds
Now just wait till they actually get to come to Texas and try it properly lol.
But how did they get it there??
Isn’t high school the equivalent of years 10-13? End of secondary school and college
The cornbread… Brit’s thinking cornbread is bland 🤯.
I'm so impressed they're able to keep their uniforms clean after that
Need more videos like these.
Maybe when this batch of kids graduate,  take them to the US for a food tour.
I thought my eyes were deceiving me....a Mammoth Mountain long sleeve shirt!
I lived half my life in South Carolina, and Texas BBQ has Carolina BBQ beat by a mile.
Love to the youngsters enjoying great food!
Do you guys get summer break there? Bring the Headmaster to America some time. Let him experience some of the authentic stuff.
As a 72 year old Texan, I am rather surprised they didn't include mustard potato salad, a standard with me, esp with spicy mustard.   For the cornbread suggest a small bit of BBQ sauce OR melted butter on top or as a dipping sauce.
Now you guys know why we have so many obese people in texas. You almost need one of those men in black memory eraser tools to forget that the food is so good.
These kids are so well-behaved. Their parents and the school should be proud.
2:12  "Oh my diddy!"  Well said son, well said
Instead of putting those beans on white bread, in the southeastern US we mix them with the cornbread. You guys always go for the mac and cheese. I think you need some collard greens instead. They, too, are awesome with cornbread.
Texas BBQ is pretty mediocre… if they’d been eating Carolina or Kansas City or some other barbecue with more significant flavor, they might have combusted!
Who cooked this
These kids don’t know how lucky they are😩
These boys are sounding more like Ollie every time
Love to see my home state's food loved so much. From the original Sonny Bryan's and many others in Dallas to Terry Black's, Salt lick BBQ and many others in Central Texas that I have not eaten since leaving I love it all. Sadly barbeque in in Florida, Alabama and Georgia just does not cut it for me and I miss good Texas BBQ.
Gotta Luv It❣️👍😍
Now you understand why we are all over weight kids 🤣🤣🤣
I love how the headmaster is always in these just enjoying himself haha
8:57 this kid looks like a young Brad Pitt.
This is the content that gets the likes universally.
I absolutely love this! Glad you liked our BBQ. Much love from the USA 💖
I love these young men...they are so real! The headmaster too.
Were did you get the BBQ?  Was it the place you took Ollie's father?
that's the jolly content we love ! amazing guys xD
Always great when Jolly visits the school!
so is the cornbread you use it like... to scoop and absorb the juices and fat on the plate, leftover from eating the meat? Thus, you have a flavorsome spongey bread?
Good to see The boys feeding the localz
"Don't make cornbread ever again."  Boy, are you trying to recreate the American Revolution?  Because those are fighting words to any self-respecting Southerner and we WILL go to war over them.
FYI guys your captions lose sync at the ad with the headmaster
The “Texas Fold.” 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ It boggles my mind Texans think (according to Joshua Weismann anyway) they invented putting meat & other things on a piece of bread and… wait for it… folding it over. I get their arrogance about the brisket itself, but c’mon people.
Eating something this messy while still in uniform is _brave_
Never make cornbread again is crazyyyy
This is the closest we can ever get to giving a medieval peasant a flaming hot Cheeto:  Giving the British flavor
Think y’all ate the cornbread wrong, you gotta put butter on top and it had to be fresh out of a cast iron skillet, else it just tastes dry and crumbly.
Native Texans, we’re Texans first before Americans. We love our state more than most love their family’s
Why didn't you give these kids knives and forks? You eat ribs with your hands, but brisket and sausage require a knife and fork.
British meat sweats. 😂😂😂😂😂
We've converted the headmaster to an American food consumer
“I’d never tell her this” but you just did and you did to millions of people 😂
I have to say......those kids don't know what good beans are, if they prefer English baked beans over this.
Always fun to watch people exploring new cuisines.       Hint: the cure for bland cornbread is a few drops of bbq sauce. Or cole slaw.
I appreciate the kid that said 'I'm along for the ride' with the pickles. Got a chance to try something new and grabbed it by the horns
Dave looks so GOOD. Onya Mr.Smith!
We aren’t fat because our food sucks! 😂
Cornbread IS cake. I will die on this hill.
🎉
Yall literally changed the brains of these kids lmao
This precious headmaster and kids ❤❤!! I love these videos so much! Great job Jolly 👏
I was hoping when they asked Mr. Smith about his vacation that they would surprise him with a trip to the U.S. like the one they did to Korea.
You need to take the school on a field trip to the US and have them experience the whole thing (American sights, food, and culture).
As a Texas resident, the jalapeno cheddar sausages are the#1 item for me.  I'll forego brisket and ribs, but I cannot ever say no to the sausages!
you guysss LOVEEE SPOILING THE KIDSSS (dont stop keep on going i love it)
Yall must've made unsweetened cornbread. You HAVE to put some sugar in it. Not a ton though. you don't want corn cake like some ppl make it, but you want it sweet with butter on it. I know some people will argue about it, but cornbreads with no sweetness to them are gross.
The crescendo baby ❤
Those seventh graders are so precious
I can't decide if that's kindness because it's amazing food or cruelty because it's going to be years before they can have it again.
Voting for a jolly headmaster road trip to us, s.korea, australia, europe.
I absolutely love these kids! Thank you for making me smile.
Cant wait for the same old jokes from our American friends
Freddie looks like a young Boris Johnson.    Nice seeing all these new boys.
I love their expressions with the new flavors they're discovering.  It's what makes the world go round.  Thanks for this wonderful series.  I do find it hilarious though that the one kid thinks that cornbread has no flavor.  Has he ever tried British food?
BRING THE CHILDREN TO AMERICA BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY THE SOUTH. I am so sorry for yelling, but give the kids a taste of freedom 😉
OH MY DAYS UK BASSLINE
Worked with a company based out of Nottingham, U.K. And had three of their techs come out to Colorado for a huge implementation. We had to go down to Texas for part of it, and they got real BBQ. They ate the brisket and Jason.exe just stopped responding for a few seconds. “Mate… what ‘av I just put I’m my mouf… I aint never tasted summat like ‘at. ‘At’s amazing. I understand why American’s get fat. I’d eat ‘at everyday. Wow”  Nobody really spoke the rest of the meal. It was just everyone nodding and saying mmmmm.
I miss Lorenzo, I guess he's aged-out.
This is why God blessed texas I'm convinced and why that song was made
Bring these kids to a Korean winter. Jeon, magkeolli, skiing, kimchijang etc. There's still so much to explore
Howdy boys from the southern USA!!! 🤠 Glad you like the food. ❤
How do you get the brisket in the UK? Is there a vendor you use?
They're not even questioning the southern ice tea at this point. We done converted 'em. 'MURICA!
It’s good to see the British enjoying some classic Texas/American food. 🍻
That cornbread looked like a no- it needs to be soft and cakey like it has some regular flour in it, too, not dry and crumbly like it’s plain corn flour or corn meal. They need to do some work on that. And how do brits not have pickles as a regular garnish? That seems so weird! Also- remind them that a gherkin is a TYPE of pickle, if you have pickle slices they are NOT gherkins, they are either dill or bread & butter pickle slices. A gherkin is a small, pinky-sized sweet pickle.
Love the high school videos.   The kids are so funny, and don't realize it.
You need butter and honey OR honey butter on the cornbread! It’s yummy!
Love the headmaster!
Sweet Corn Bread is better
Bless their little hearts! ❤
“Oh, you’re the funny one” had me laughing! Happy Friday to everyone 👍
America!
Okay but who smoked it, and when, and where? They didn't fly the kids to Texas. Did they have the food shipped to the UK from Texas and just reheat it? Was it made in the UK?
As a Texan this video made me so happy. The only things they disliked were the same things I dislike. Cornbread and dry mac n cheese.
OK, now it's time for Govna and Barney to try the BBQ! In fact, let's see a series with them enjoying all the southern classics in the USA!
"My mouth is mesmerized."  Me too, sugar, me too. My gosh these kids are so darn cute
This was cute, but why do the white kids always have such bad haircuts? It looks like they all went to the same bad barber.  The also look more like Junior High kids too. They all look too young to be in High School.
I can't stand these broccoli haircuts jfc
Oh I presume the Texas style BBQ came from the same London England restaurant where Josh and Ollie took Ollie's Posh Dad?
Jolly ROCKS!
Great to see this channel back at the boys school, best being Dave the headmaster!
Spread some honey whipped into butter onto the cornbread and it will not be so dry. That or we use it to sop up the juice from the beans.
Guys, this is an example of what you do so well.  Skip the Hollywood celebrities, they add nothing.  These students (and that great headmaster) are WAY more interesting and funny.
After that, enjoy the Beef Coma I love slow smoke cooking😁
Greetings from Texas baby! 😊
You’ve absolutely ruined them for Sunday Roast. Those boys will be chasing the Texas Pit Smoked Dragon for the rest of their lives!😂😂😂😂
Cornbread, by itself, can be a bit dull and uneventful. Adding a little creamy butter makes it better. Personally, I like a sweet cornbread, like the "jiffy mix" cornbread. it is more like a corn cake, and is moist.
The headmaster has a great Tv / Radio / video voice, actually. At times he reminds me a bit of Ricky Gervais. If Ricky Gervais ever needs a stand-in, you know now where you can find him.
These are the videos I always love to see how the boys and headmaster react to food.
They're back! So happy.
“I don’t even think I can eat food here anymore” So funny, it’s priceless!
The parents are probably thrilled they are getting well fed since teenagers are bottomless pits! 😊❤  It’s also a double edged sword…. Food that good will have them asking for it more often! 😊❤
Very shocked to hear these kids say things like they have never eaten a pickle before or they have never had ribs before. You can tell they’ve had a very sheltered life. Lol.
Idk if anyone pointed it out, but the subtitles are out of sync as soon as the sponsor segment comes, they are of the conversation after that segment, a little early
LOL , when trying Pit Bean the first thing they do it put them on bread/toast . 😂😂😂
I always laugh so hard at how big their eyes 👀 get when they try American food.  Hope they can visit some day and enjoy a barbecue 😄😄😄
Off course you’ve never tasted anything like it, British food is depressing dog food from 100 years ago compared to American food
They need to try KC BBQ!
Maybe they should not eat the beans with the bread. It may not be the right bread to go with the beans
Beans??? and PIT lol the cackle I cackled HAHAHA
To be fair, I never really have cornbread without butter or honey
Did they fly in a Texan? 😦
"Dalooks amazing!"
How do you get this Food for them in the UK?
Wish they tried some jalapeño cornbread!
Oh that was an expensive bill. You have definitely ruined (Americanized) their taste buds forever!
British people discovering flavor.
These boys heads are bout to blow up with all the seasonings 😂
The one young guy said he doesn't know if he will be able to eat their food again 🤣
Come on over to America!💖
As a Texan, everything look on point, but the cornbread was WAY off it shouldn't crumble apart like that and it needed to be buttered. That's why they didn't like it because it wasn't made right.
It's awesome to see their reactions to something we in America take for granted.
For once I am eating the same thing y’all are
You can do 90% of that in your backyard, with a grill. But for some reason, no one grills in this country. Been living where I do for a decade, and I think all my neighbours combined have only made like 3 bbqs in total. Ridiculous.
13:11 That is NOT ‘Southern” tea. That is SWEET TEA, and we do not all drink it. We call it Sweet Tea.  Man, y’all gotta get your cultural appropriation right, guys! If you’re gonna borrow from us, get it straight!❤😊😂
I'm glad they liked it but Texas isn't the only place with BBQ.
Start a company that makes and sells smokers.  You might have to plant some hickory trees but fruit wood works well.
I always love how they say "British baked beans." Y'all realize when you're eating Heinz baked beans...you know that's American right?
Where did you guys buy this food from? Do they deliver to Putney?
Mr Smith is an absolute joy.
lolol, those kids are so cute. I am an adopted Texan and here in Dallas I get BBQ like every week or every two weeks. It is amazing.
So glad the British Highschoolers are trying Texas BBQ!
You guys should do a treat  to the whole school to Texas BBQ for lunch
The English palate is so underserved.  Crazy how underwhelming their food is.
My mouth is watering just watching these kids eat.
“Absolutely sublime”
Jolly Boys: Headmaster, this is our idea — we want to bring in food, have the kids react, and upload it to YouTube. What do you say?  Headmaster: No, you both are crazy! What will our school look like if you do this? We are educating the kids — our future!  Jolly Boys: Fine, we’ll feed you too.  Headmaster: Carry on.
I laughed when most of them immediately put the beans on the bread.
They all had an eye opening experience on that day
11:49 you should have given them the cornbread with the beans. They would have liked it better…and many, many texans eat them that way.
Ngl...that brisket did not look too good...lol
Josh and Ollie, that is absolutely criminal to give them cornbread with no butter on it!
We Texans don't 'sneak' meat into everything.  There is no 'sneaking', we put it in there and you're not gonna miss it!
Cornbread must be buttered, heavily!
Literally as an American this is heart warming that people outside the US trying out our American cuisines
We need an entire series where the headmaster tours the USA
I was lowkey hoping they would invite the headmaster to a trip to the southern states in the US when they asked what he was doing for his vacation. Kind of disappointed :P
Lovely they didn't give the kids forks for the ribs. I think the chef in Tennessee would be proud.👍🏼
Why? Why? Why don't you all ever not put any butter on the cornbread? No one ever eats cornbread without putting butter on cornbread or hushpuppies! It's an absolute sin!😮
Love that the Boys are using their fingers!!
Love watching the boys and teacher tasting new foods and sharing their thoughts. Some cornbread is very dry, so put butter on it. You could see the cornbread crumbling.  They may like lacy cornbread.
Okay, time to plan a BBQ tour of the USA with the headmaster in tow. TX, Carolina, Tennessee… and a stirring finale in Kansas City! Make it happen, lads.
" I'm still comprehending the flavors" lmao, the poor kids have been deprived of basic condiments their entire lives.
I'm a 5th generation Texan.  We have NEVER called anything a "Texas fold."  You got that off the Californian you did the Austin BBQ review with.  That is NOT a name we use although we have been eating BBQ like that since the late 1800's.
I have never heard of breadcrumbs on mac & cheese. Mac & cheese should be topped with more cheese and the cheese should be crispy.
@jolly can you do reading college
Do the brits not learn to eat? It's like it doesn't register how to get the food into their mouth properly and then the flavors don't register because they have never eaten anything  with spice or seasoning. Too much texture in Mac n cheese
this looks like pretty terrible bbq but im sure its still one of the best things these kids ever ate lol
That corn bread should have had fresh melted butter on it
Aww, when I was their age, I also wasn't a big fan of cornbread and the beans! It took so many years when I got older for me to actually like them! And it's so nice to see Dave again! ☺️👋🏼✨️
You need some maple syrup to put on that cornbread
Are these kids in the USA?  How do you source this wonderful stuff in Britain?
02:47 Ollie finally getting the recognition he deserves 😂
The Texas Fold is the icing on the cake.  One key to Texas cornbread is to put a lot of butter on it, and sometimes, fresh honey.
Headmaster can kiss that weight loss GoodBye!!!!!!
Btw Texas bbq is readily available in the UK, cooked by Texans
I wonder who they asked for help with this. Because it isn't easy to make this magnificent artwork happen.
This should be classified under child abuse, because these kids got blown away with flavor
You did them wrong by not giving them honey butter with the cornbread. Great video though!
I guess they don't know that cornbread is commonly topped with butter and/or honey.
Actually, most sausages in the US are pork. Many people buy chicken sausages for reduced fat or cholesterol. Kosher influence has rendered most of the hot dogs beef, and in places like Texas, we make sausage out of beef, and venison, and alligator…anything, really.
This is kind of cruel... They are going to be left chasing the dragon in chippies dreaming of burnt ends and ribs.
Who the hell is ruining steaks so badly over there that you don’t consider the fat to be one of the best parts??? If the cook knows what they’re doing, the fat should melt in your mouth.
Brits eat to live Americans eat to enjoy
Honest question, do yall fly a cook from the States over there to prepare these meals, or do yall just have someone follow a recipe? Love the videos, and im so glad yall went to Darrels while yall were down here in SWLA!!
I think it's safe to say the Texas BBQ was a hit!
I think the captions are messed up
British food suxx hard what can I say
These kids are never going to want to graduate. You guys should just bring the kids and the headmaster to the US and tour the country for a month.
Headmaster is the OG for a reason haha
Do they not have seasonings in England. Why is they’re food so bland?
YES!!!! Love our favorite headmaster and these kids’ reactions!  “I don’t think I can eat food here anymore “ . Epic.  So happy you’re doing this with a new generation 👏👏👏❤️
All things BBQ 🍖 are now ruined for them 😂
English ppl will swear English food is better than American but everytime i see videos of British trying any kind of American food it looks like they've never had seasoning or flavor before
8:14 Honey butter makes cornbread into manna.
Thank you for justifying why we are over weight in America!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I used to live 5 minutes from Terry Black's (the bbq place Jolly visited a few years ago) and now most other Texas bbq is mediocre to me.
You should’ve put butter on the cornbread for them babies
how are you getting all this food to the UK
Nobody's gonna say like, how fit Mr. Smith is now?
These kids never go out to eat? Like jolly comes with fast food foods, they are all amazed with it. Like whej they bring taco bell, Wendy's, five guys, and others.
This is my FAVORITE video ❤
im freaking hungry
"I'm not waiting there for 16hrs."  Oh, bless your heart, you sweet, sweet summer child...  You don't wait there whilst your brisket is cooking.  You put that baby in a smoker and go about your day or you smoke it over night when you're sleeping and then in by supper time it's ready.
I think this is my favorite one you've ever done 😂👌👌👌
I apologize if you've answered this already, but do you have the food shipped there frozen and prepare it before the show? Or does it come ready to eat? I must know, please!
I just want to know how you guys get the food from America there??? If its all home grown ingredients, how the hell cant you make the food we make???
Always happy to see folks enjoying something from the states. Sorry for all the...nonsense. They'd like the corn bread more with a little butter.
Ya gotta put sweet butter on the cornbread
Ollie's sponsor transitions are immaculate as always. 👏🏼
I bet that cornbread wasn’t cooked right. That’s why they didn’t like it.
These are my FAVORITE vids…the kids and Headmaster are hilarious!
Yesssssss
DAVE IN AMERICA!!
ALOOOOHA❤
Josh Anyone ever tell you that you look like  Like Davy Jones from The Monkees ?
Serious question: How did they get that food over to the UK?? Did they take one of the pit masters with them to cook it, or...? Genuinely curious...
이제 한국어 자막은 없는건가요..?
The included CC isn't matching, you might want to change that.
As a born & bred Texan,  I'm glad they enjoy our bbq! 😊
4:20 "Everything is better with bread in it." Spoken like a true Brit 😂
Love the headmaster! Lol They need butter and honey on the cornbread.
Love this! Cracks me up.
Always loved the British HSers series
I’ve had bread ☠️😂
Put a little bit of honey and butter on that cornbread and I guarantee he'll be singing a different tune. Cornbread by itself can become dry and gritty. Have it with Texas Chili or with butter and honey and a completely different vibe occurs.
Heard burnt and wanted to slap Finley with some right education having that brisket slab as my hand. Giving right flavor to the dome of the skull with good eating as these Joly gentlemen did.
I saw you slipping in a Saily Ad into the Closed Captions. Lol
Is this an all boys school? I dont recall seeing any girls on these episods. Do they just not want to try the foods? Would love to see thier reactions too.
I don’t know why I torture myself watching your videos 🤣  I’m a vegan on a strict medical diet that doesn’t even have access to full meals.
Question how do you get them authentic food from us ? Does someone cook it there  Or like a burger from a fast food place how do you replicate it for them
I’m going to England for the first time next month, any recommendations? I’ll be in Yorkshire
I love seeing the boys rip into the BBQ with their hands.😂 BBQ is messy, fun, and delicious.
Where did you get this delicious Texas BBQ in the UK please???!
Josh and Ollie's trip through Texas paying off right here 😂
Hogwarts tries gluttony😂
I'm often in Austin, Lockhart, and Luling Texas and get my BBQ fix on a weekly basis.  I know how lucky I am.  Great tacos for breakfast and great BBQ for lunch,
captions are broken after the ad starts
I was suddenly like woooh brad pit 😳
I will forever love this headmaster. You really need to bring him to Texas next time and let him experience the BBQ down in Austin.
The Headmaster is actually GOATED fr
Now that everyone has had Texas BBQ, do y'all see why Americans are so heavy??? Who wants to exercise after brisket???
That one kid can play Young Goob from Meet the Robinsons 😂
the lads should have put some butter on the cornbread.
I want to see your families eat Texas bbq (in Texas) now!!!
Not again with the TX fold lie 😭😭Born and raised in TX, ain't ever heard anyone call it that.
I love these highschooler videos. You guys are great with them and their reactions are so natural and pure. I also love that you include Headmaster Smith. I think this BBQ just blew everyone's minds.
These kids and the headmaster have such genuine and funny reactions in every episode. Love this channel. Greetings from your friends in the USA.
This a good one
You need some butter on that cornbread! 😎
Now you know why we are all so fat lol 😂
This was so much fun to watch. I don't know what happened, but the closed captioning was way off in the middle of the video right when they ask Dave about his holiday to Portugal.
Can't say I've ever had Texas BBQ it does look good. But I don't like smoke flavor well I might have only had fake smoke flavoring.
YES👏🏻🔥 i just love these
Headmaster is looking fit A/F. Nice work there, mate ❤
Good to see Mr. Smith and the Fulham boys again! My mouth was watering within the first minute of this video. Lucky boys!
These poor kids will never be able to eat British food ever again.
Take these boys to Texas ASAP!!!
A 12 year old kid using the word lovely, I love the British people. 🇬🇧
“This is the best sandwich I’ve ever had.” Yeah cause you eat chip buttys and sausage rolls every day 😂 BBQ is like every day mundane food down here
Woo!
I do say, the USA may have the BEST food...a melting pot of all the best worlds cuisines!
I remember when you guys tried to eat ribs with utensils 😂
Just wait until they get to meat sweats.
Have to put butter on cornbread or it is dry
2:52 nailed it 😂😂😂
Today I learned that "Cole Slaw" sounds like "cold sore" with a British accent.
Are pickles not a thing in the UK? I dont expect them to be as big as they are in the US, but they're reaction to them suggestions they're rare.
These kids are going to be begging their parents to take them to Texas now! 😂😂😂❤
The headmaster though. His face is looking like he's re-thinking some life decisions... He's booking a ticket to Texas as we speak. 😂
As a southerner in the USA, so happy that they like our food
i miss armin
Pickles: it's like cucumbers but better.  Exactly!
What a nice surprise ❤ Really needed to watch a new video
The little curly headed boy hitting the highlight of his life, looking up to the ceiling with his eyes closed 😂
I love this! BBQ is everything
Is this a reupload
Is it me or does Harry look like young goob from meet the robinsons
"You're a funny one". That is an understatement when it comes to Ollie
LOVE IT!!!
The accent always kills me oi what is this myth…seasoning😂
They absolutely crushed it lol and now I'm hungry thanks!  Love watching these episodes!
Love from Lower Kentucky ❤
Ive been waiting for another one with the kids! Awesome!  Thank you! God bless from Oklahoma!  ❤
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. been waiting for bbq to hit the english primary school palates
Yum. Making me far too hungry. I’ll have to steal it
Missouri's barbecue is better we have two different kinds Kansas City style and St Louis Style
The 'You're the funny one.' HAD me ahahaha
꼬맹이들 맛있는 거 잘 먹는 거 뭔가 부럽고 귀엽다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That one kid that went Yesssss! is epic!
Smiled from the beginning until the end. Thanks Jolly!
Now get 'em a Texas barber...
What does year 7 and year 9 mean ?
When are you bringing the headmaster and the students to Texas? Get some of the 3 star Michele star BBQ! 🥩🍖
These boys lives are about to change forever after trying this
💯👍🏼🇺🇸 thank you very much for the reaction video Albuquerque New Mexico in the house
I just checked if Jolly had uploaded anything new… well
Helpp, Im starving 😭
Earliest I've ever been to a video!!! And I've been a subscriber since Olly playing Scream-Go....😅
