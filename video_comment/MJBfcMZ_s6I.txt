Enak banget klo pny Pemerintah yg bisa kerja
Be Singaporeans n taste the world of Singapore nowadays.
America needs PM Wong!!!!❤
This guy really knows about leadership and management and here presents a compelling argument on what the worlds needs now .
Let’s move forward, the world do not need US or Israel
Nobody can predict what will be tomorrow vide these tariffs & tomorrow never dies
As a non Singaporean, who has lived here for 65 years, I am proud of Singapore's Leaders. I wish other countries had leaders like them.
garbage statement
Funny thing , fair trade agreements are not fair
aptarialtation。-asian languange，singapore very  good。-English languange。
singapore acterial speaker  very  good  job。
This is not COVID.This is a manipulated thing by Trump. Trump just want 10% GST to cover for Taxcuts given to the rich.. no differnt from Singapore. PAP and Lawrence wong was fear mongering.
Singapore got a slap on the face by being a US puppet always following orders from Washington. They were one of the first to ban Russian vessels and suppoted US advice and hegemony  Now talking about ASEAN cooperation. What a joke!
this corrupted leader till notyet settle the compensation settlement to victim employee of company Keppek FELS (SEATRium). he supporting corrupted company.
If small country fear of information war then should develop the two tiers of information storage and processing : one for network one for internal in clude all from order to production to data entree use mainframe for separation and network only external data
It is not American fault but there are other hidden political hands that drive the economy into jungle of landfill of trash and deathbed. Every on the news is not 100% true
There is concern about heavy weight appliance on buildings or apartments..there is toothed gear foundation underneath as trigger. So do not use toilet or waste water too heavy
Let's not forget the clear and informative response by the Deputy Prime Minister Gan. Looks like the Singapore government has some depth in quality.
Trade is over already stupid
👁️
This speech is reassuring. PM Lawrence Wong you are a definition of a great leader!
Jesus
Singapore buys more stuff from US than US buys from Singapore, the tariff is not fair based on what trump says are reciprocal. Sorry Trump is illiterate, so reciprocal is just a word to him, he don't know what it means, just like grocery, he never knew what groceries meant. He only knows HAMBURGER!!
This is worth to listen to.

Task forces to support New landscaping work mom, mof,MOH, tariffs on entrepreneurship, Etc, metal gold plating up  upgrading buildings higher costs Made in China 🇨🇳 125% vs 10% Workforces union trade union NTUC  Less demand more imports less exports
❤laws and legal  No clear and clean rules on how to regulate tariffs WTO MEMBERS! ❤
this kind of response and explaination that needed by the people. I envy Singaporean for having this quality of leaders, delivering unveiled truth but not lacking the details to survive this calamity. Not only rely on others mercy, blaming the world, and talking empty words about "our country is strong" hahaha
My hats off to your PM!
Rich countries exploit the poor...that is the result of  "free trade" by the WTO. What has it done for Africa?
we love you Mr Lawrence Wong   As a Thai borned fed in and by Singapore foods I am growned .  I still love Singapore ❤❤❤
His words don't match his actions , to reduce cost of living is to increase gst from 7% to 9%  , listen to him sure die .
PM office , did you all notice PM’s speech on Trump’s tariffs got many edited, tweaked with titles like “Sg PM stands with China ! Criticize USA!” , “ SG is our partner in fighting Trump !” , “USA losing S.EA. Leadership , China’s Century is real !”  circulating in China ?
PMs & Presidents all over the world are very much worried about Trump’s tariff policy and are explaining the position to their people how it will affect their economy and stock markets and , seek advice from the public and experts how to face the impact. But in our country, President, PM & FM are on-tour to foreign countries as if nothing happened. God save the nation!!
Thanks for the statement.
Trump’s cap 🧢 made in China 🇨🇳 $50 +$27 Sale price$77.  Think 🤔  Item from China  Make up by $27 plus $50-$cost 2 The problem is not China item cost$2 only.  🤔 thinking cap 🧢  Singapore 🇸🇬 souvenir shop sold $25
I’ll have a tariff for higher prices lower sales of gold . Goldsmiths sell less with highest prices.
Global demand slow down…. Higher costs up 🆙  Higher building prices up 🔝 Lower prices up 🆙 😊 Reno 🆙 tariffs. This will indicate higher costs
Well spoken, to be honest, I am confused about what Singaporean's national  language is, normally the language used in a council must be according to their own nation, however  when they use English  in the council that means there is no national language of their own.
"Do not fear"? Hello ur annual salary USD$1.6MILLION of course nothing to fear
Hi nicr tomeetyou Singkapro..

Listening from America. This is such a wonderful, fact base speech. And I can’t believe the contrast of our ridiculous regime and hurting us with no care at all. I did note vote Trump into office!

this is the end for singapore. without a US led globalized world, small nations like singapore will be smothered by regional powers like china. you can trash talk America all you like, but it is only because of US supremacy that singapore was able to succeed.

The reason why LW is so passionate about the end of the global economic system is because in his own words 'he thought the US is a friend".  There are no permanent friends or foe but permanent self interests.  He keeps referring to the WTO but the WTO judges that are supposed to arbitrage all grievenaces have been boycotted by the US, hence no resolution.  It hurs so much to the SIngaporean ministers because all of them came from the same mould, basically believing that the US would serve as a global policeman and now realised that it is a global bully and gangster.  A few recounts matters: Singapore have participated with the US in the illegal war in Iraq, LHL together with Shinzo Abe of Japan tried to roll out the TPP to screw China for the US only for Trump to tear it up but not before China label Singapore as a two face country. We sanction Russia from day one (the only country in ASEAN to do so) and obeyed the US orders not to install Huawei 5G gear in Singapore.  We are a critical supply base to the US military for their forays to the SCS against the PLAN. After supporting the US agenda for so long, we forgot about China's BRI and the BRICS membership which both Indonesia and Thailand are fledging members.  Once the artic sea lanes are open in summer, and the Kra canal is developed by Thailand and China, Singapore would be sidelined.  Now it is time to wake up. China has launch their plan for a free-trade partnership with the region and to increase trade and Singapore better switch trajectory to partner with a more stable partner.
I hope none of the Singaporean ministers are going to Washington to kiss Trump's xxx as what he has claimed about the 70 countries queing to surrender to the US.
Very very good narratives Sir....👍👍 From Philippines
Human beings are lucky to have this great guy Lawrence Wong.....
What happen if China implement export tax on par with US trarrif?
Biden collapsed the US economy but now Trump wants to improve US economy.
Singaporeans are people of prayer. God will give them wisdom to handle every situation victoriously . When God is for us no one can stand against us. In the mighty name of Jesus of Nazareth, I pray. Thank You Lord for everything. Amen. 🙏
Fail guy
Since 2014 many china chinese setting up and buying singapore firms and companies ...is better to charge singapore 30% tarif...
Got to say he got more praises than lhl. How come ah.

Jamus Lim is very poor in economics
I don’t think the US view China as the only unfair trade partner. The country, which has experienced trade deficits for so many years, also sees a host of other countries like the European countries, Canada and Mexico reaping the benefits of an asymmetrical tariff situation that has disadvantaged the US in an unsustainable way.
Sing. export to the USA is only 7% of your total export. Why u need to stir up storm in your teh-tarik☕️⁉️  Just divert your problem children from US to other economy, including the UK & HK. 😂 Sam HO ~ Prof. & Speaker, Said Business School, Oxford.
Hats off PM Lawrence Wong 👏 You are a true leader for your people and for the whole world …
Good. No retaliatory tariffs.
It's an envy that you have such a smart and logical leader over there who KNOWS how the economy really works.  Unlike a group of selfish clowns running a stupid circus recently, a total nonsense.  The clown's tariff adviser should be fired immediately, and Harry Potter got to lend a magic wand and turn rest of the clowns back to normal human beings again.
Everything is so make sense from this speech
The Prime Minister of Singapore is a truly remarkable man.
LATEST NEWS :  TRUMP ANNOUNCED 90 DAYS PAUSE ON THOSE NOT RETALIATING AGAINST THE  TARIFF. CHINA TARIFFS INCREASED TO 125%. TIME 0320.10April.
N.N.Taleb's "turkey parable" - as a turkey, you'd think your master feeds, you, protects you, loves you and has your well-being in mind... and then Thanksgiving comes... or if the master starves... whichever is earlier   The truth is u s has no friends... only vassals and colonies (read: turkeys).
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
I'm not singaporean, but when i saw his face and heard He said, "Do not Fear",, (goosebump me!),, & i want to give big applause
Bless evening Sir Pm Lawrence,..you active here sir kind of economic way of communication,thanks for speaking me God blessed po..
so singapore going on trade war.
Nothing wrong on having a trade deficit with country A. I agree. But you must be on plus with other countries to balance that deficit. The sum of trades excedent,/deficit with all the countries should be sero.
Thank you PM Lawrence Wong. You truly make Singaporeans proud.
Using tariffs to the hide Singapore Government problems....can trust his talk. Is it Singapore invested too much in China and keeps too much money in China? Now China economy is collapsing.....Singapore will lose everything. See the end of May and June... Just my findings and understanding.....
Some we can answer, some can only answer behind the door...
I wish our British MPs shared this much insight and had half as much professionalism and skill in speaking as this gentleman
WAT PM LAWLESS UNG REALLY MEANS TO SAY ::: 1. IT IS ALL MY PAP GUBMINT'S FAULT !!! FOR 10 % TARIFF IMPOSED BY US PREZ TRUMP !!! FOR REASONS 2, 3 AND 4 BELOW !!! 2. OUR 9 % GST IS EQUIVALENT TO 9 % TARIFF ON US GOODS !!! WE THE PAP GUBMINT....HAVE ONLY ONLY ONLY OURSELVES TO BLAME FOR THIS OUTCOME !!! NO ONE ELSE TO BLAME BUT OURSELVES !!! SHOT OURSELVES IN THE FOOT....BY RAISING GST 9% FRM 7 %....WE ARE GREEDY +++ STUPID STUPID STUPID !!! 3. WE BULLY OUR SENIOR CITIZENS !!! HOLDING BACK THEIR CPF SAVINGS 10 MORE MORE MORE YEARS !!! AS A RESULT 400 -- 450 CITIZENS COMMIT SUUCIDE EVERY YEAR !! EVERY YEAR !! EVERY YEAR !!! HALF OF THESE ARE SENIOR CITUZENS WITH NO NO NO MONEY TO LIVE !!!

Trump rejected and soon dismiss WTO, sir.... 😢
U dont take a stand when usa vs china meaning u r not a friend to usa. Simple as that. Somemore china has been using singapore as the second location to export to usa to avoid usa tariffs on china, why you didnt mention that
With this thoughtful and articulate speech, PM Wong has clearly defined the perilous road ahead, the problems that Singapore and other economies will face and laid out the levers that the SG govt can pull to blunt the looming threat of tariffs. He has also clearly demonstrated that Singapore has an able captain to guide the country through the stormy seas ahead with a firm hand on the till.
voting PSP, LMW and TCB is doomsday for Singapore.
Sg will stand to benefit as a restructing hub. So no doomsday here
shine PM shine for Singapore and Singaporean living in this  tiny red dot.
Singapore runs a trade deficit with USA. But despite having no tariffs placed on US, Singapore is still subjected to 10%. Unequal relationship. I guess we might see reduce in made in USA purchases in singapore... Tesla? Chicken in a Biskit? Post Cereal?😅
This is a tough time ahead for everyone. Wish everyone can tide through this wave of economy madness
The only way this ends is for Xi and Trump to meet in SG, kiss and make up. We'll gladly spend another 30 million or so to make this go away.
Mr Donald Trump Is A Businessman, He Believes In Making Fair Deal. He Has A First-mover Advantage & Pushing For Peace Through Strength. Negotiate In Business Deal With Him.
新加坡国会很有素质👍👍👍
A gripping and engaging speech with a boatload of substance and keynotes which every country in the world especially those of us in Africa who opt for free trade : should hold  in high regard and put on a pedestal…!!!
I Would Still Want To Ask Mr Lawrence Wong, Why The Need To Announce Publicly, You Are "Tested Positive For Covid-19?". Is It Necessary?
Mr Lawrence Wong, Please Go Visit Mr Trump & His Cabinets To Negotiate For A Fair Deal.
They? Who Are The They? The Cabal, The Deep State Or White Hats? Go And Negotiate, They Are Waiting For Your Next Move.
I am more concerned about what we need to give up to the us to maintain the status quo. Will they ask us to pick a side and join them  against China.
We wish we had a leader like this in our country, or maybe i'll consider to change nationality i guess.
Mr WONG, review how Singapore inflame the undesirable situation by  siding on the CCP? You forgot how your "citizens" or "residents" successfully helped CCP by obtaining the sanctioned chips ! Don't act like a righteous man!
I Am Wondering Whether My Posts Are Censored? It's Painful But At Least I've Tried To Share The Real Things, Not Fear-mongering Narratives.
Wondering Why I'm Only In TG, TELEGRAM & RUMBLE Social Media? Freedom Of Access To The Real Truths. None Of Singapore's Media Report Anything Worthy Of Following, No Different From All Western Controlled MSMs.
The lady at the background at extreme left is so sleepy.  She should  excuse herself  and  go and wash her face instead of struggling to keep awake nodding her head on and off.
Most useless incompetent Singapore PM.    Besides panic, paranoid, kancheong, emotional, creating public fear unnecessary causing stock to fall steeper than countries with higher tariffs, what has he achieved? Nothing !!!    1.  No trades n tariff details of both US n Singapore  2.   No affected details 3.   No solutions  details 4.   Failed to understand Trump n his motives.  Just like GST 9% hike speech, lots of empty talk, nothing tangible, no details ABSOLUTELY NOT PRIME MINISTER MATERIAL  .
Mr Lawrence Wong, Singapore 🇸🇬 & Singaporeans Must Know The Truths, The Cold Hard Truth. Singapore Leaders Have Been Following The Same Path Of The Deep State.... Singapore 🇸🇬 Founding Father Knew Everything, But His Son Had Fallen Into The Kelong. I Am APOLITICAL & I Am A 72-year-old True-blue Singaporean.  I Know The Real Truth About Why You, Sir & Other "Leaders" Must Publicly Announced Being "Tested "Positive" For Covid-19. It's Not Too Late, To Negotiate With The Trump’s RECIPROCAL TARIFF,  Which Literally Mean Global Free Trade. It Is That Simple, If You Have The Interest Of All Singaporean In Your ❤️ Of ❤️.  People Said The Gods Are Watching All HUMANITY’S Doing, But I Know, It Is The Benevolent Extraterrestrials Helping The Earth Military Alliance In Draining The Swamp, The Deep State On Earth. I Meant No Harm. I Want To Do For The Good & Love ❤️ Of My Beloved Country, SINGAPORE 🇸🇬
I have watched this, thanks for the statement and also Q&A. I have learnt few things more about this and realize that the situation has far greater impacts to us as Singaporeans and we would need to brace ourselves for worst scenario. Anyway, I have summarized the key points discussed, for those didn't have time to watch the whole video.   1. Shift from WTO to Bilateralism and the 10% Tariff: PM Wong describes the shift undermines the Most Favored Nation (MFN) principle of the WTO, which ensures equal treatment among members. The blanket 10% tariff on imports from nearly all countries, is potential the new norm.  2. SG's vulnerability in transition period and unchartered new norm: SG, as a smaller nation, is vulnerable in a system dominated by bilateral negotiations where major powers dictate terms. As a global trading hub that thrives on free trade, the long term outlook is bearish.  3. SG's tactics in maneuvering: SG is negotiating with US bilaterally, same as other countries. SG has decided not to impose retaliatory tariffs, & announced formation of a task force to support businesses and workers.  4. US Invocation of Emergency Criteria under the US-SG FTA: US needs to invoke emergency criteria to impose tariffs, SG is engaging with US to understand the basis of this invocation & including the possibility of consultations and dispute resolution under the FTA.  5. Slow growth and halt of business decision: The huge uncertainties are putting business planning on hold and will slow growth and lower demands. SG still remains an attractive place for FDI, but future's FDI will depends on when the transition period is over.  6. Impact on Businesses: Eroding Margins and diversification shock. Businesses experiencing eroded margins and the unexpected challenges faced by those who diversified their supply chains (e.g., to Vietnam) due to higher tariffs in other regions.  7. Impact on Specific Sectors: The outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing (especially electronics, semiconductors, and biomedical science), wholesale trade, and transport, will be significantly impacted by weaker global demand.  8. No Comfort in Lower Tariff Rate: While SG faces a lower tariff rate, higher trade barriers will be detrimental to SG's long-term prospects. This potential "advantage" is also subject to change and could lead to trade imbalances that might invite further scrutiny.  9. SG's Strategies for Resilience: SG will increase efforts to remain a key node in global trade, forging closer links with like-minded partners committed to open and free trade, including ASEAN countries, new markets in regions like the Middle East and Latin America.  10. Focus on Long-Term Structural Changes: The situation necessitates preparing for long-term structural changes, potential job losses, and increased volatility. The task force will be crucial in understanding and addressing these evolving challenges.
Prasie our Lord that PM Lord is sincere and clairyvance talented.
First, you must understand that the current proportion of the U.S. GDP to the world GDP is too large (it was very small when the WTO was established). The growth rate of world trade is faster than that of the U.S., so the U.S. has to print more dollars to keep trade running smoothly. Additionally, Asian countries earn dollars but don’t want to spend them on American products, services, or investments. They only want to buy U.S. Treasury bonds to earn interest. About 6.6% of the U.S. government’s tax revenue is used to pay interest. Trump’s import tax revenue could offset 2.5% of the interest expenditure, which might allow government departments to function normally. Before November this year, the U.S. must address the issue of $1 trillion in short-term national debt. Reforming the WTO can only happen three years from now.
Well delivered! The world would survive without US for the next 4 years.
Well spoken PM, well done❤
This is PM Wong’s best speech thus far, insightful and proactive
Great speech from PM Wong.
I understand your concerns, PM Wong.  We should all be willing to say it loud and clear that USA is the instigator.  What do you want China to do?  China at least is in a position to stand up for the bully.  I respect that.  If there is not China doing it, who is doing it?  At least I hope some countries will come out to support China's effort.  I don't understand why you said EU see China import is a dumping ground to them.  This is rude, PM Wong.  A trade is a trade, its a transaction between 2 parties, both are willing partifipants.  When someone sell to EU, nobody said they dump it.  When China sells to EU, you said China is dumping things to them.  NO, this is not right.  Chinese products have good quality.  What else do you want?
Why And How To Solve The Problem? Not why and how the problem. BRICS, DEDOLLARIZATION, STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK. But This Is Not LKY SINGAPORE ANYMORE. HE WASN'T AFRAID OF AMERICA. But Singapore Is So Americanized its like the 51st little America
Exactly. We have a trade deficit with the US and yet we are being slapped with a 10% tarriff. Based on Trump's logic, US should be slapped with a tarriff since its being reciprocal. We import services like Disney+, Netflix, Google and Microsoft from the US. Time to cancel these subscription if any.......
Sheep trust wolves
PM Lawrence is a true description of a great, educated and wise leader.
I want this PM.   Why can’t we have nice things?
ASEAN definitely needs to trade more with fellow members, less dependency of the US market.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Everyone's singing praise of PM Wong but he's actually got great support fr DPM Gan too. I like how he response to questions directly but in a measured manner. Some good questions raised by the opposition members too. Hopefully SG economy can hold up against the scenarios they anticipated n not spiral downwards.
In short, the States wants a War w China. China is ready. The showdown to determine the very survival of worldwide democracy and free trade 🙏
TRUMP JUST MADE THE WORLD  EVERYTHING GO UP
Basically America don’t want bankrupt alone so they bring all nations to be the same like them in crisis .  ASEAN countries should be United to handle this situation, the same like Europe . I saw if European is always United in all kind cases .  Anyway , great leader  , well spoken 👍.
Very good explanation by the Singapore PM about the reason Trump did this. Now we blame WTO and China.
this is why Singapore  now is Rich very well said
Excellent analysis of the situation by PM Lawrence Wong. So glad I am a Singaporean and we are in good hands with our strong and stable government.
Excellent, strong and clear response. Thanks PM.
Somebody falling asleep when PM Wong is speaking but pretending to nod as though she is listening and understands anything 😂😂😂
MP Gan Siow Huang looks like she’s constantly posing for the camera lol
striking my pineapples off grocery list from singapore now you dont want free trade dont have it canadians says no prob
All the countries will unite and work together since we’re the believers of globalisation. Let America practice self isolation. The world less America will be fairer and more peaceful. And guess what the ultimate winner will be China. What an irony to US!
It’s not that bad guys think about what these people stand to gain from telling you how bad it is. Theyre not a totally neutral/objective party (unlike Think Tanks, etc)
10% tariff  vs  COE prices that are paying here… which is more ?
0:36 nonsense.
Notice how the government does not dodge questions, but address questions with genuinity and intelligence with clear logic? Somthing that the US can learn from.
To put it plainly and bluntly, trump wants to extort money from all the countries, to pay off its interest of the national debt and demand countries to invest in US as it’s on the brink of bankruptcy.
We all are aware of the problems very acutely. During COVID, we are faced with in-your-face moments of the pandemic, where it dampens our economy and causes health problems, with the potential to kill. Then came the ukraine-russia war which again cause the economy to upend as well. Then now this tariff war which is supposedly worse and in wider scale and depth than the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs.  Lawrence Wong, you mentioned developing capabilities, skills future, whatever, and that has been the main government message for the past few elections. I seriously doubt that these measures are enough to actually tide us over and continue to push us into the future, and more importantly, sustain our country and our citizens.  I seriously doubt that banging the head on the wall consecutively will lead to a new solution. Until there is clear evidence that we are indeed faring better, I have little faith that this new government has the capability to tide us smoothly into the future, especially when there are so many ministries that made recent glaring errors which are seriously quite ridiculous
Very sleepy bank bencher
That idiot at the back is sleeping 😴
Thank you PM Wong.
*Why no one ask why the SG Gov is NOT going to talk to the US? That is the real question here? it's truly odd that they want to play a game of fear looming to citizens. Oh...GE coming so must do that to win then fix this issue. Vote wisely people*
dont wayang la Mr Wong , who heck cares about this (except for u) ?????
US dollars don't use it then the world will peaceful
When I see Trump as individuals, I saw him as a nice man. I was shocked of his changed 'brand'. I believed he was pressured to proof himself as 'hero' for his country because initially he was not for the presidency.  But imao, his mission and vision had blinded himself what's the world interest including Singapore.  Will the world including Singapore die without America, I don't believe so.  With BRICS formed to waver America's domination, the world have new navigator to explore the world with many possibilities, including better.  America used to slander China and said bad things about her. But in reality China is a generous country concerning what she did in African countries, middle Eastern and other part of the world.  China also champion in defending the downtrodden (Palestinians).   America now had deliberately created enemies rather than friends which is a formula of a downfall, isolation and destruction. It's not the citizens but the leader.  Singapore with her gold heart and crystal mind leadership, will navigate the world safely with like-minded leaders of the world.  We are more united than ever now, with one heart, mind, determination and strength, we'll defeat all odds and emerge victorious because we are guided by the Will of AlMighty.  "MAJULAH SINGAPURA" - "ONWARD SINGAPORE"
Why is there a "professor" asking should there be anti dumping procedures(i.e. more tarrifs on others...) being imposed when the world already has Donald Trump? Its like fighting insanity with more insanity. But then again I'm just a dumb unschooled old uncle here. Cheers.
Singapore has very mature , wise and intelligent leaders.  Example to rest of the world.
Oh please grow up pay up make everything equal such a drama spoiled country
The Singapore Government should be THANKFUL 🎉to the US Trump administration for just slapped with only 10% Tariff  !!  Has Singapore 🇸🇬 been n the China Communists BRICS Bloc... we will be Economically Finished  indeed ... to be slapped with at least 30% Tariff 😮!
Tariff or no tariffs still the same. Everything from food to transportation and housing will only cost more while shrinking in either or both in quantity or quality. Now if the trade wars escalate into world war 3 starring the USA and China then its GGWP. Both countries have nuclear weapons which will result in nuclear fallout and  affect everyone for centuries to come. Why couldn't Oppenheimer and friends come up with a weapon that didn't poison the world?Oh well it is what it is.
Would be useful if CNA could label on screen the speakers names n positions and political parties
"These are not things you do to a friend"
A small island, but its government has more wisdom than a library!
I liked the part where they started slapping their hands on their armrests like penguin flippers
Considering that the only real nation that can come to the rescue of Singapore is US 🇺🇸, you would think PM would have a little more respect & have more of a tone like India has or Bebe yesterday at The WH, if you form new alliances to drop or depend less on US 🇺🇸, would they step up as you know US 🇺🇸 will is something to consider, don't you think Prime Minister Wong 🤔
Formula of Donald Trump Tariffs  Indonesia export to USA = $ 28.1 Billion  Indonesia import from USA = $ 10.2 Billion   Deficit for USA = 28.1 - 10.2 = $ 17.9 Billion  Deficit USA / Indonesia export = 17.9 / 28.1 = 63.7 % rounded to 64 %  Donald Trump gives 50 % discount = 50 % x 64 % = 32 %  Reciprocal tariff for Indonesia = 32 %  That is simple math calculation from Donald Trump.
WWII and Before period: Singapore gains more in Southeast Asian, all from America and China❤
Whenever our country is in trouble, it’s always an opportunity for PM Lawrence Wong to display his problem solving ability and great leadership to steer us out of the woods ❤
Who is the blue coat female MP that sits behind? I always see her in every session 😊
Consider what the world had done to US in the past, 10% is nothing.
Singaporeans 🇸🇬 we are bless~ :’) it’s not gonna be an easy 4 years ahead~   It also seem like US have no ideal and not learning from mistakes keep using old ways to force their way~ the world is really no longer the same anymore~
I am actually happy for the us. Their people must feel so resolved.
ASEAN must take a page from Japan and Korea’s playbook from the '80s and '90s. Back then, Japan Inc. wasn’t just a slogan but a national industrial identity.  Factories, communities, and supply chains moved as one. Korea followed suit with its own conglomerate-driven model. It’s time for ASEAN Inc, a unified, bloc-wide industrial strategy. Our regional giants need to stop moving in silos. We need our own Keiretsu, the interconnected ecosystems that compete globally, not internally.  And maybe Singapore should make this pitch to Trump: “We aim to become the model others can follow, to show the world what it takes to earn 0% tariffs.”  Because this isn't just about trade. It’s about ASEAN rising together. It’s time to expand.
I rarely comment on parliament videos but for this I want to comment. I am grateful that our government is very alert on world economic affairs as I am also very worried that Singapore will bow down to the US in this case. My opinion is Singapore have to turn, we need to change, we need our government to lead all our industry for this change. There is no way ASEAN will avoid this and thus, Asians must unite. ASEAN current best choice is to work more closely with China, no better way out for us.
well... I am not a singaporean but your PM sure delivers it to regular people like they teach us in school. Explaining why and how it becomes and he sounds sincere. He sure is charismatic.
Thanks for speaking on behalf of humanity but sadly some leaders proclaimed as "VISHWAGURU" now hiding inside safe place and shut up there all holes.
Thank you very much, Mr PM.
GE coming. All mp no more absent for parliament. All seats are filled. Bravo😂😂
What would the late LKY do?
the way he describe how americans feel about their economy sounds the same as normal every day singaporean.
Singapore is a friend to all nations so our govt will know how to chio and how to siam along the way to see a better sunshine somewhere. No America is not doom. Look into Europe Australiasia Asia . I think our govt can make it happen. Crazy rich Asians right? So come on!
Out of all the current noise, this is the only country and leaders we listen to, even by chance! It gives sense of confidence and assurance - which you can trust on.
LHL needs a pillow and blanket
Singapore exported approximately $44.92 billion worth of goods to the United States.  This figure represents about 9.4% of Singapore’s total exports, which amounted to approximately $476.25 billion that year.  The primary categories of these exports included electrical and electronic equipment ($13.17 billion), machinery including nuclear reactors and boilers ($9.38 billion), and optical, photographic, technical, and medical apparatus ($5.62 billion). ￼￼
That "no body is left behind" is often said but not successfully accomplished as there are many who have indeed been left behind!!!
The U.S. goods trade surplus with Singapore was $2.8 billion in 2024. So balanced or even a surplus, so Singapore is a good trade partner
To all Singaporeans, I hope you have a fantastic Prime Minister—God bless you all. In Malaysia, we are facing challenges with excessive politicking and divisive tactics that have been in play for over 65 years, often exploiting racial and religious differences. It's time for Malaysian leaders to come together and seriously reconsider our approach to the pressing global economic issues we've been grappling with for far too long...Things must change ..!!
Arrogant  Leong is not listening ..........sigh! He 's in his own world.
US imposing tariffs on both their friends and foes is fair rather than tariffs only for their foes only. Apparently, the reasons for U S is not just protectionism but it was reportedly also to reduce or eliminate their gigantic trillions of debts. The reason for non compliance with FTA was also reported by US. There are of course resulting effects which the US is fully aware of.
#prudence and #financialdiscipline very nice words to hear especially from #government #leaders
Im so scared
Just be more positive than worrying. We can still doing well. Only is tougher to drive thru but is still work well. Less profit, but cutting the necessary cost,we will survive well as our country still keep move forward  as earth keeps spin without stop.
The big elephant in this Global economic room is China's unfair trade policy.
Stop buying US goods
Singapore charges VAT 9% so please don’t preach about free trade when you have hidden tariffs.
Your a xhinese identities.you are not true aingaporean.no malay
Spoken well with a sense of gravitas! Thank you, PM Wong! 🇸🇬
Yes a great speech proud to be Singaporean . So knowledgeable.  God bless Singapore
The surplus enjoyed by USA is not enjoyed by majority of their population, or voters.  Earnings from intellectual properties benefited only a small minority, comprising of investors and senior corporate executives.  If the other major economies like the EU, PRC, SK, JP, India etc., are united in boycotting the US products, it is possible to blunt the US offensive.  The bully in the room is only going to get his way if there are some others in the class act as accessories.
Majulah Singapura 💪🏻🇸🇬❤️
Saint Lucia is a small Caribbean island, a former colony of Britain and France. The population is approximately 180, 000. It imports millions of dollars in US goods, and sells very little to the US. The 10% retaliatory tariff on Saint Lucia is unjustified. The island poses no threat to the US economy, and it certainly has no bargaining chips. It has no war with anyone. Saint Lucia is in one way connected to Singapore by one man. Singapore's economic development is explained by the Lewis model, developed by Sir Arthur Lewis, a nobel laureate in economics who was Saint Lucian himself. Saint Lucia, though far away stands with Singapore.
Mariam Jaffar is smiling and sleeping😂😂😂
Singapore has good leadership to lead and support the citizens. Taskforce set up immediately with no delays to face the challenges that tariff war brings . Kudos to the leaderships 🎉🎉🎉
USA is forcing the rest of world to pay their fisical waste by rewriting the trade rules. Singapore and others must not let them get their way.  I hope SG and other like-minded countries united to fight.
Look at it at a bigger picture. If USA loses it's economic power it loses it's military power. Then you are now left to fend for yourself. Any country will be interested in your city state and also the rest of southeast Asia. China will overwhelm Southeast Asia. Without USA there's nothing you can do about it. So better be kind and give USA the leverage it wants because it is the keeper of many countries' freedom. It may not be ideal, but this is better than any possible alternative such as going back to 1900 where the strong shall rule and take whatever it can take. Do not expect UN to help you it won't. This is more apparent in Taiwan where they face impending invasion from China. They are willing to provide zero tariff to USA because it is still a small price to pay than lose everything to China. It is unimaginable for Taiwan to engage in a tariff war with USA where it's survival is always guaranteed by USA. It may not be apparent to all southeast Asian countries but after Taiwan the rest will be in chaos. You may not agree with my opinion but that is how i see it coming in the future if worse comes to worse.
From the many comments here, I am convinced that a basic introductory level curriculum in economics should be manadatory in schools, as well as philosophy 101, particularly in ethics, logic and epistemology.
More China plants will setup here n shipping directly to USA?
I envy you, Singaporeans, to have a leader like PM Lawrence Wong who can reassure you to stand as a nation to face this challenge in a clear and detailed way. Never get enough of listening to his speech.
It is a reassuring moment to see the leaders of the community gathering in this house to assess the current situation on the American Government conducting their wimps and fancy to the detriment of the world before. I hope we can continue to seek deep  to find a right pathway for Singapore.
Beautifully delivered!
Lawerence is an Amateur PM. The biggest destabilising issue facing Asean is a seismic split in grouping within Asean countries.  The Philippines or Indonesia may embrace America for Investments. Others may follow suit. Spratyl and South China has always been an issue within Asean against China. America has Choices for partners to split Asean.  Singapore will be in deep waters if Singapore Choose China over America.  Lawerence should stop his rhetoric on America and WTO. Do you really think the PAP is rules based redrawing boundaries for elections 2025  ?
Good update. Thank you PM Wong for doing that on short video earlier on and now officially. Yes we will huddle and go through this bad patch together. Will do my duty for my country to see what I can do in my own space to help.
US tariff implications means to tell the world to "Bite the Bullet"
We always take advantage of the disadvantages .... Trust me , we go get thru it
Bah😂
Voucher Wong  CDC VOUCHERS li liao  PATHETIC short term solutions  paid by Millions yet INCOMPETENT   PLEASE RESIGN NOW
👍👍👍✌✌✌
Donald Trump revealed the only reason we’re still paying an income tax in America is because US Politicians are paid off by foreign countries to not mandate tariffs  Anyone complaining about tariffs is selling you out  “In the early 1900, they switched over stupidly to an income tax. And you know why? Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America. We don't wanna pay tariffs. Believe me, they control our politicians. If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make then and now”  We are all literally paying an income tax because US Politicians are taking bribes from foreign counties to enrich themselves  You should be furious
Indeed right.  There is a pro from china call 沈逸 talk about PM Wong speech but I totally don't agree what he is talking. He is too aggressive.
Majulah Singapura!!!
If you don’t know me by now.  You will never ever know me.🤔💡
Spineless Vietnam is the first selfish country bowed to Trump.
Give us more Cash to tide over and we love you.
Applause
遇上逆水行舟之时， 亮出順水推舟之计。 方能克服远虑近忧！😊
We have full faith in you and your party leadership. Nor matter what, as long as we are united, vigilant and keep upgrading ourselves, we should a able to ride through the bad times!
My prayer for Singapore 🇸🇬.. God bless us all.. don’t be afraid!!
everyone knew this tariff was coming... surely it's not a sudden move.  so why no prep?
There is one certainity for Singapore.  Slower economy growth for Singapore  Recession is inevitable.  Job losses, Business shut down, defaults and a property market crisis.  Singapore government was unprepared American trust on Asean lost. China has been dumping  to corner and kill other markets with decoys and patriots of China.  China will be hit hardest.  Asean and other countries must decide for America or China for their economical survival.  China CCP faces turmoil within China when Trump Tariffs evolve.
The best PM for the job in this troubled time
Can see our dear PAP MP the malay woman falling asleep.
Let's all SEA works together to defend against the Bully by America
Thank PM and Gan Kim Leong for high light this matter. Is hard work to continue engaging Asean members on cost savings.
Free contest of ideas: we debate till death, and who will do the work of navigating the tariffs and bring us orders and jobs?
LMW REALLY DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT APPRECIATION OF SINGAPORE'S POSITION.
I wish there were more prime ministers in the world like Mr Wong.
This is exactly why we need support for SMEs bedrock of country
Do the MPs really understand what has been shared by the PM?
What a professional Politician.
Sir, SkillsFuture should be used by retrenched seniors above 45 years to pay success fees to skillsFuture-approved recruitment agents who successfully find jobs.
from HK, it would be nice if our Chief executive have 1/10 of your insights and abilities. No wonder Singapore thrives
Maids and young children are horrifically abused to death. You are not going to do anything? Business as usual?
US has always been the one & only sitting by the table while the rest of the world have always been the menu on the table. The 'rules based orders' were simply excuses for US to deviate from the actual existing laws and bully their way through economic or military coercions.  US's allies need to start developing alternative measures to decouple from US instead placing all the eggs in US's basket.
Having a capable PM Wong at the helm is truly Singaporeans’ good fortune—especially in steering us through this trade war!
I am glad we have intelligent leaders in Singapore.
Can anyone explain what is TARIFF in the first place.  Hopefully is not some form of Import Tax which to be paid by the importer. If so What this tariff got to do with the exporter.  Sorry to ask a stupid question. Hopefully some brilliant scholar can enlighten my ignorant.
Singapore should increase GST to 10%, so that we can also imposed that on US when they export to Singapore.
Singapore can survive. Without any countries involved.
United Singapore 🇸🇬
Rules based globalisation is overregulated globalisation.  Open and free markets do not thrive under where under table money can be exchanged.  The WTO framework is vulnerable to corruption.
Subsidising practices by China was learnt from the west long time ago from agriculture to many other exports. Our leaders should not reprimand China by repeating after the western narrative without stating the facts v.v… dangerous to play either side while most sgpeans will agree that we shd be neutral.
Err... Singapore needs more of US than the other way round.
if every countries was zero tariff before and now everyone is on a 10% tariff, other than the america local manufacturers, isn't it still a level playing ground?
We know in manufacturing, to maintain continuity of businesses, companies always maintain duo sourcing, so if one vendor increase price, we switch more of our order to another vendor to mitigate the risk. Since USA is making SG more costly to trade, what are or how are companies able to look for alternative to stay profitable and survive?
US buying more from the world, than the world buying from US. China have undercut US with their disregard of copyrights. Enough is enough, US has been generous to the world, but unfortunately, the rest of the world did not reciprocate.
If sg recounter bk tariff, u wont be able to afford buy apple products, being receptive is correct
XRP baby lets go! new system
Amazing speech
Dear Singapore.   Don't worry to much.   You still have Indonesia & other Asean countries in neighborhood , you can take much advantage from them.  Better not criticize USA as a bestie / deep friendship. One day they will help you when military chaos happened in ASEAN.  Singapore is a small country in term of size of area , but you are rich country. Enjoy it.  Better wait & see for Singapore.  Don't take it personaly , it is just advice.   Finally , you know what the best for you ( strong Singapore )  Hope for the best and prepare for the worst
Not reciprocal tariff. Is trump’s crazy tariff😂
Your speech brought me to tears when I realized you are the same person increasing GST to 9% 😢😢😢
Sounds good but since when Singaporeans needs and concerns are met. Do u think fighting with so many foreigners for a job is something to brush away? Especially with the volatility of global, geopolitical and economic problems. You can promise us everything but it didn't take long to feel betrayed by our own govt.  Sure, u offer vouchers but what makes it become so necessary to do so? Are we managed well? The impact of the Gst increase has worsened our problems, yet the govt minimizes that it added to the burden of the ppl. The place is so over crowded and ppl need to compete with foreigners while most of them do not have to do ns. Is this fair? Our ppl fall behind for 2 to 3 yrs bc of ns while they do not have to worry about it. During ns, pay is low too. How much has our govt put thoughts into these problems?   So, b4 u promised us again that u will take care of us, remember we have been burned b4. How are we supposed to trust u again? What guarantee can you give us? Housewives are hardly rewarded or appreciated and in turn the policies forces them to juggle household chores, take care of kids and yet need to go to work long hours to make ends meet. What's worse women nowadays are expected to contribute financially as well to the household. This is only one of the reasons for the lower birth rate. SG internally has many issues but we do not see the root of the problems being addressed especially, the high cost of living. When citizens become increasingly disgruntled, instead of listening...all IBs start to attack and twist words mostly attacking the person instead of maturely arguing with logic and reasons on the topic. This makes Singaporeans feel oppressed and invalidated.   Now, when tariffs hurt many elites investments, govt only looks at how to minimize it but what can the common ppl expect?
Thank you dear PM🙏❤👍👌❤🙏
I think it's good to clarify if the tariffs are imposed on all goods and sectors. I thought there are exclusions for pharmaceutical and semiconductor in this round of tariff. Good to provide us a clearer breakdown of impact.
What if Chinese exports to SG, then repackage and export to US, will that have 10% or 104% tariffs?
It seems to me that whenever there is an increased subsidy on example childcare, skills training, they will become more expensive. The common sales tactic is that after the subsidy or the skills future support, you don't have to fork out cash. This price hikes diminish the effects of the support
i dont understand, when citizen ask the gov not to increase GST by 1%, gov continue to do so stating we need to stay competitive. But when USA slap an unfair 10% tarrif (even thought we are in deficit against US), our gov say is ok lets observe? Should there be some additional counter measure(innovation, new tech, skill upgarding are all what we habe did before the tarrif hike) for SG to stay competitive(i am really worried by the move)?
Pls help to consider opening more university seats for our youth this coming year so that we can take this opportunity to 1. not increase the unemployment rate as new entrant to the work force will be worst hit, 2. to put more of our youth to the new economy skills, and 3. keep more job opportunities to the middle and higher aged.
4:00  US consumers buy more from the world than they buy from home. Why? ❌The costs of production methods in the US are not cheap. (The "blue collar" has become a deterrent for entrepreneurs.) ❌The costs of production "from the world" are the result of all the malice and manipulation  (for example, in China and Europe, manufacturers see their kWh subsidized.) In Quebec, the price of a kWh from an aluminum producer is well below the price paid by "Mr. Everybody." ✅"Reform was no longer possible," there were too many deviants, too many clever people, too many vicious people in the nations and particularly in China which has become a very, very rich country.
A US presidental term only last five years. My wealth is enough to sleep the effect off without losing sleep at all.   Just streamline and simplify your life needs and wants will do.   Tips when it come to reading news. News are use to create worries and fear nowadays. Learning to not be overly drawn into it is the key to a happier life.
Wexare seeing the fulfillment of a promise.😮  Hebrews 12:26 NKJV [26] ......but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also heaven.”  🤔
No more free trade la Just pay the. Tax Free free free. No more la Payy pay. Pay la
Singapore will kneel and deify the United States, buy more American weapons, treasury bonds and shut up in a cowardly and fearful attitude.
Dear Prime Minister, I think there is a strong case to be made why Singapore should be paying zero tariffs. Please make the case to the Americans. Negotiate as Singapore, not with Asean.
Opposition always trying to  talks n talks only, pls..give suggestion, proposes n solutions lah..char li points ..4 peoples to see , i wants yr opposes solutions...WP...😂😂😂
Sir, can you take over country with 281.2 million people near you country?. their president its too old.
Salute to Singapore PM.  Dear Singaporean, can we exchange leader between SG and Indonesia? 😶
It is not over. Trump's presidency is temporary - 4 years and then have to see
Lawrence i thought u choose CCP politics n CCP market 😂😂 than us shouldn't affect SG lah 😂🤣😂🤣
Warning ! Currency manipulation and over taxation will be in check now . Its is a well known behaviour. Free trade must be fair trade !  Time to reap what u sow . Make amends , admit the many failures and stop the BS !  This Mustn’t be another excuse to increase taxes on the citizens AGAIN!
Very good update by the PM.
Shifting blame to USA?
when are they cutting their millionster salaries. mayonnaise $600k ....
Should make speech more focused on how Singaporeans may be impacted and how each potential impact will be guided/aided by government
Oop...Hope our Honourable PM Wong is WISE enough to see that our Singapore is a small Resources-less Nation 😮...certainly it's High Time for small Singapore to put a Moratorium (stop) on importing all PMETS workers for at least ten years ( then see..lah ) so as to give more jobs for our local born Singaporeans 😀!
Very concerned on the CPF investment funds should act quick to switch out of US investments， the idiot in the White house wipe away pension of retired civilians globally
US trade deficit was 0.8 T last year. Global GDP was 104 T USD. W/o US market, the world lost less than 1% of GDP, so what! Calm, let US rest into irrelevant.😜
like that also want to do statement???? nobody asked for it la wth
53:44 Absolutely a big NO.  Goods manufactured there will be very very expensive due to labour cost. Also, extreme weather are too frequent and too large scale with such headlines in news like "Severe weather threats put millions on 2 dozen states on alert hhis weekend". Anyone who suggest this need to be
We are really fortunate to have a wise and inspiring leader. Having a 104% tariffs on China shows that US is not sincere to have a dialogue. Let's look at Vietnam's case and we can see that US ask for even more, more is just NOT enough... Tariffs on Singapore is totally unreasonable... trade deficit or surplus is no longer the issue here.
Automated trading platforms. Incubators.
If every country should have at least 10% tariff, wouldn't that make trading with us more attractive to them since we are one of the few countries with the lowest at 10%???
It was always kind of a fantasy of mine to have the A.I. find the equilibriums in small , medium and large caps. Accross the worlds need.   If I were a banker , I'd be really stoked..
Singapore will surely overcome these self destructive Trump policies because you have been maintaining unity n good leaders. Nothing is impossible for Godly people/nation. Watching from Nagaland
The weak countries will bend the knee  The rest are calling BRICS for a partnership enquiry  The global South must create a progressive peaceful future now without the hostile volatile west
Simple...PAP leaves Singapore with the Foreign PRs and Bought NRICs we local born  Singaporeans will fight it out again from bottom to the top...
If running a trade deficit is so good why is it most Asian and European countries try to structure their economies in such a way that they will get a trade surplus with the USA?
Just need to wait out Trump's 4 years term. He cannot be there forever like Putin or Xi. By the time company bring their production to the US 5th year already , Trump would have been history .
With Prejudice to None.... Obviously President Trump ( supported by his patriotic MAGA AMERICANS) are doing the Logical and Right thing by imposing HIGHER TARIFFS  on COMMUNIST CHINA 🇨🇳 and its BRICS nations which are fighting fiercely to DE-DOLLARIZE the International US Dollars ( luckily Singapore is spared for not in the BRICS bloc!) ! Certainly a Grim Reminder to our Singapore Government 🇸🇬, now and Future NOT seen to be the "Buddy buddy " or  "Bosom friend " of Communist CHINA... or be doomed to Financial/Economic disaster if the US government deemed this small Garden-City Nation called Singapore a sort of  "Economic/Political SLAVE and Pawn of  CommunistCHINA " !!
Follow excellent example of Israel PM to practize ZERO tariffs to either parties.
Why not save $$ by cancelling F-35 orders?
I'm not surprised if pap raise the gst to 19% after the incumbent won the ge. Because it's citizens are the source of income.
When Mr Leong talks, I feel hopeful that he may finally pleasantly surprise us, but seems to fall flat as usual.
kick out u.s. tariff we more support china asia, all nation no support old u.s.economy, hit back old u.s. economy and we all interest new economic world order with china
9:24, blunder? I think Nixon pressured Germany and Japan to appreciate their respective own currency value because Nixon felt that these countries were taking unfair advantage of USA by devaluing it's currency to export to USA. Germany revalued it's currency after the threat but also bc Germany was dependent on USA for military defence. Japan didn't quite comply, but the 1970s were turbulent for other reasons as well (e.g. oil shocks etc).
When tariffs were imposed only on China, seems like nobody made a sound. It affected China but others are cool. Implication was not global, in fact many benefited from it. Now that a global blanket tariff is imposed, we got worried, equilibrium is broken. Global reflexes becomes unpredictable. Everyone may come out worse. I have a feeling that we prefer China to capitulate, for our sake.
Mr prime minister sir, your speech make my tears roll. Jokes aside. What to do, when the biggest boy decided to rob every nation. I deeply appreciated for what u have done for singapore.  Keep rocking! Perhaps this is the only way to keep us going.
Great leadership
True fact about US tariff laws and trade.
After the global economic crisis, we became one of the fastest growing economies. During the pandemic, we had a slow start but we became the most resilient country according to Bloomberg. I’m confident under the leadership of our able government, we will rise up to a higher level.
All ministers must take a  40% pay cut first and the common people take a 5 % pay cut. Everything is money in singapore. Reduce food prices in sheng siong and giant. No coe and erp for 10 years in singapore. Now is the time to use our reserve money to help all singaporeans . Malaysia will be the next place to migrate if singaporeans cannot handle this economic change or stay at home and eat maggie mee.  It is time for singapore billionaires to help working singaporeans. Time for us to spend less.
Many countries (i heard about 50) already rushing to negotiate the tariff, but i wonder if any country can even trust "negotiated" agreements with someone who don't even abide by his ownself created trade agreement such as NAFTA, beside tearing away the nuclear agreement  with Iran.
Im sure you have already touched on it but uncertainty is fertile ground for speculation.   People paying attention can make back , say , 10 percent ?
All those Singapore so called scholars and retired officials talking loud about how great China is and how USA is falling behind and now USA only impose tariffs a little bit and all are now in panic mode. All these Singapore scholars should ask help from China and should trade with China if they think China is so great.
US is no one’s friend. It only looks after itself. They will take 90 % and leave 10% for you. Come and live here for a month and you will see it yourself.
The world must push for recognition of invisible trade in the calculation of trade deficit and trade surplus.
this is an act of bully from the tariffs implementation
Choosing the right friends is important. Only two main choice, its either Pro-US or Pro Russia-China
Everyone is condemning Trump’s tariff but no one can name one country that has zero tariff on US imports. Hypocrisy and lies.  What about non-tariff and regulations that block US products from being sold into the country.  Trump had talked about this 35 years ago.  Look up the interview he had with Opera Winfrey on YouTube
no more world policeman , protection from attack of sovereign lands/ sea is DIY now ,  unfair trade from other countries is expected ,
"To be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal"  Henry Kissinger
Salute & respect Singapore government as a neighbour.
Good. Call them out for doing this to Singapore.
WTO is universally Corrupt. A tariff is a bargaining tool, used as a first step and not eternally permanent.  It will fluctuate, as business does.  Fair trade leads to Free trade.  China has been stealing intellectual properties and stealing from the world for decades.  When you disallow products from other Countries, then complain about an equitable and fair compensatory tax….look within yourselves to fix your issues.  Singapore will be ok, give this correction time…the relationship between Singapore and the USA is welcomed and strong.  What I just witnessed here is just self serving panic propaganda for the uneducated on behalf of a failing WTO organization.
After pandemic this earth is no more healthy zone 😅
PM.thank you for delivery a speech with sincerity and enlighten us the   true fact about US tariff laws and trade.
Reassuring to know there are competent people steering the country in uncertain times. Thank you
PM, please review the support for SMEs, especially in working capital loans with lower rates. This will enable our local companies to try to expand regionally. That would always help our local SMEs to diversify the markets that we serve, directly contributing to our economy with more trade and hiring
Ah! Become china hub somemore lah..
Great Excuse To INCREAST GST to 10% right PAPPIGS GOVERNMENT?
hello all these we can read from world news. we hire u and pay u high salary to bring us or propose us solutions, not to be news anchor or broadcaster
Thanks you CNA for the news
CDC VOUCHERS
世界已經改變了。 為了人民的就業必須鼓勵國民學習練習複習他們的中文。 這是因為我們如果失去了美資，可以吸引中資來給新加坡人就業。 畢竟中資對新加坡非常有興趣。 新加坡還是一個國際都市港口和區域最有信任制度的國家。 我們不怕， 最重要就是不要只是注重英語教育，而是開始注重中文教育。 不只是懂中文語言。 而是懂中文文化現代中華人民共和國的生意態度和思想不是政治，而是他們怎麼和人與人之間做事辦事。
What is the difference between GST and tariffs
Being in the discord and starting trading is literally changing my life I'm starting witha small $18,500 account but I got it up to $96,000 in one week! Not a lot of money but that's a big growth for me🎉🎉🎉
Oh no, the 财神爷，will come, take back all the goodies he give out once GE is over.
Thank you, PM. You lead, we follow 💪🏻
Not rule based, But Power based..Just like anyone with power set the rule.As in Singapore, PAP is in power so they set the rule n regulation even if they chao kuan change the rule, none ordinary dare to overthrow them, but all just follow blindly.Ask yourself if truly fear is on pubic our livelihood, the 84 white should be on retrenchment list very soon to consolidate and cut cost on manpower.If all crisis from human creation only affect ordinary u n I, it isa laughing stock to why we still pay u leader high pay n secure job..We should hv subcontract their job to external asmuch like how local job is taken over by ft upon competitive pay, think deeply and vote wisely singaporean..🤔🤫🫣😅🤣😂
US tariff move is only to stop drugs enter their borders by using third countries border. But many countries ignored it
Singapore is clearly a cut above the rest among ASEAN countries. As a Filipino, I can only hope President Narcos Jr can be at least a quarter as brilliant as PM Wong.
With rising global uncertainty including talk of renewed tariffs if Trump returns, many Singapore SMEs will feel the pressure.  While Singapore may not be directly targeted, we’re part of a highly interconnected global supply chain. Any disruption in global trade can ripple into increased costs, reduced demand, and tighter margins, especially for local service providers, manufacturers, and exporters.  As an SME, we work hard every day to stay competitive, upskill our team, embrace green practices, and adopt new technologies. But external shocks like global trade disruptions can hit us hard and fast.  We hope the government can continue to step in with timely support for more SMEs.   Singapore thrives because of its resilient SMEs. Let’s ensure we’re protected and empowered for whatever the global economy throws our way. We hope the government bodies like Enterprise Singapore, IMDA, and MTI can continue to support more SMEs. 🙏  🙏 Just a voice from the ground, hoping for more listening, more action, and more support.  #SupportLocalSMEs #SingaporeEconomy #DigitalTransformation #AIForSMEs #SmesGrants
Thank you CNA for bringing the news.
Singapore 🇸🇬 needs to avoid being used as a cover for Chinese firms, then it's going to be fine.
Whats your plan B?
Don't suck up them. The US never has our backs. We're too far and too small. Time to build and  strengthen new alliances..
I feel safe when PAP is in charge as always.
