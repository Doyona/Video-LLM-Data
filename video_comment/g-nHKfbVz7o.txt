Cork are the best hup the rebels
10:07
Cork were in the first half and tipp won in the second half
my comment didnt come out as typed    sorry
tnot tuned into tippsime has settled    a lot of talk about huge bust ups in cork dressing room  i dont know neither do 99.99999|% of gaa people so forget about it     what i do have is an honest opinion of this game   tipp out hurled cork for 38 mins of 2nd half    cork couldnt handle will or desire of tipp   too much slack marking and forced errors under close tipp marking    patrick horgan taken off was a huge mistake   why not shift him around every 2 mins   give tipp backs something to think about    no man marking on young mccarthy  after 10 mins surely management should see he was making hay off loose play  i dont knowjust my  however i was in gaelic grounds tipp v limerick tipp impressed me limerick were not tuned into tipp liam cahill knows how to take advantage of every defect he sees in opposition   tyeams taking them lightly and then turn on the heat.   i think he aimed for playoffs and all ireland series and let cork and limerick have their munster final    just my thoughts
Talk about delivering under pressure. Darragh McCarthy being sent off against Cork earlier in the season, being sent off once more in the semi-finals. And now this remarkable performance!? Absolutely unbelievable. I still say that the semi-finals between Kilkenny and Tipperary was an even more spectacular match as such, but this is also absolutely stunning! One also has to mention Rhys Shelly, scoring a point and in the next moment brilliantly saving the penalty. Outstanding! Massive congratulations to Tipperary!
13:10 so forgive me for not being 100% clear on the rules of Hurling.  But could he have just slapped the ball into the net from the ground like in hockey?  or do GAA rules mandate he has to have the ball up before scoring?  again . . . I'm sorry to those who know enough to think this might be a dumb question.
Great match but so many illegal hand passes
Poorest second half performance from any team in the history of all Ireland finals. a complete collapse.
I just randomly got here no idea 🤷 what’s going on
Up  tipp
What a match!  Both teams effectively demonstrated their place in the final.  As a fan in the States, it was exhilarating to see my favorite come back so convincingly in the second half.  Trying to keep up with the sport here is frustrating.  Streaming is VERY difficult and usually not available.  What a treat seeing the Tipp lot prove themselves.  Cork has to be congratulated for their part.  Not many would have predicted the Tipperary squad coming back in the second half.  Thanks for getting both the entire match and highlights posted-a lifeline to American!
How many of each teams roster are professionals brought in from overseas? Perhaps none??? Which might account for the excitement of the spectators. Something so many other codes have lost/given away.
75 minutes ruined by 30 seconds of bollixed referring....! The referee was 50 meters away from what happened in the square and the sending off....the Cork full-back was fouled twice, such is the game of hurling today.....and the umpires didn't have the b...s to speak up....!
Liam Cahill rymes with Liam Mc Carthy & so dose Darragh Mc Carthy, Full Team Man of the match Preformances, TiobraidÁrann Abú, Sin é an Mc Carthy Isteach arís an teach Iomáint !! Feel for the Rebel supporters , If Tipp out I'm a Rebel xx
Those  eyes
this final scoreline is 8 points away from the 2008 scoreline (Kilkenny 3-30 | 1-13 Waterford). Shows just how badly cork were destroyed that second half
Ah ffs you morons
I wish we had Hurling in Germany. I've been to Ireland several times but never managed to get to a pro game. 😞 But even watching a youth game once was a real treat.
I love how they use 1980's ice hockey helmets, but why are they different colours on the same team? Are they from their club teams or is it a positional thing?
"Where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows"
My word what happened to Cork in the second half, a sending off and leaking three soft goals is what happened to them Marty....
song name at start?
In the UK all people speak English, even the Irish and Scots are shy to speak their mother tongue in public, just like Russian language was imposed in the Soviet Union.F.NORTHBERG
If you look at the game, and stop the video, you'll see almost 22 players between the Tipp 21 and 45 meter line....they left two Tipp forwards inside the Cork 45 m line, sometimes there was no one between the Cork keeper and the 45 m line....
Embarrassing stuff from the Cork keeper
Cork fans may have outnumbered Tipp fans two to one however Tipperary fans can roar twice as loud as Cork fans Anyway that Tipperary second half performance was simply fantastic - Cork being restricted to scoring only two points in the second half was absolutely extraordinary - You never see such a low score like that in a modern day All Ireland hurling final - The Cork team imploded and their manager seemed clueless on what to do - The confidence in Tipperary team just surged for it looked like men against boys - Tipperary are the only team to win an All Ireland in every decade since the finals started - We can relax now as we have until 2039 to keep the reccord going
COME ON TIPPERARYYYY YAHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
There needs to be rules like in football, where you have to keep 3 backs, back, or three forwards, or withing the 45 meter line at all times.....Tipp just parked the bus for the last 14 minutes....! They put soo many bodies in the small square, you couldn't spit there without hitting a Tipp player!
18:13 They needed 4 goals
Kilkenny  JOHNSTOWN should beep when they actually win an all  ireland !!! 😂😂😂
I like seeing good defence, they should have a few defensive highlights too.
RTE Sport - Why do you put the full time score in the video title??? For those catching up and have avoided it all day until bringing up the video here. Highlights are brilliant but please consider leaving the score out!
That clown with the tattoo on his arm will never hear the end of it 😂😂😂
As a Corkman I have to extend my congratulations to a superior Tipp team on the day. They brought an absolute hunger and desire that Cork could not match. Any other day I would be shouting for Tipp. A great, traditional hurling county. I was very nervous coming into this game, but I was sure it'd be Cork's year. We seem to be getting a lot of flak online about being cocky or overconfident in general. Personally, I dont see it, as we havent had the success lately to merit that. So to those slating Cork supporters, have a good look at yourselves. We're all GAA supporters at the end of the day. We're all Irish too. No need for the insults. Again, well done to Tipperary
Cork will be back
No test since the Munster final and tipp were ready for them. I feel for pat ryan hes a decent guy in what was a tough year.
I am an Italian Mayo fan. I just love these sports. Truly fantastic, electric atmosphere. Croke park is a national treasure. Wow. Fair play Tipp!
The Empire Strikes Back....Tipperary
What happened to cork anyone ever seen a county crumble like that
Surprised RTE didnt have the commentary in Arabic and make the players wear hijabs
I spent 5 years growing up in Tipp...dont follow any other team in any other sport - Tipp in Hurling - thats it...I get goosebumps whenever I see that shirt....theres nothing like it on Gods green earth....
That Stadium looks 90% Red..  where were the Tipperary fans.. ..
Well played Tipp
Great second half performance by Tipperary. But poor all ireland for quite some time.
i hope they had enough spare change left to pay for the tolls on their way home lol!
A game of two halfs
Guinness > Beamish
This is what happens when you get high sniffing your own farts
Willie Connors played unreal
Noel McGrath to score his last point for Tipp like that was pure poetry, what a legend and inspiration !
As a Dublin fan i can't believe this was the same Cork team that got 7 goals by us. In a way i would've liked Cork to win after their dispare but all their fans are way to cocky. That performance from a team was has been on fire from having potentially one of if not the best season of their history so far to just bottle it by just 2 points. Im actually thinking Dublin could've beaten this Cork team if both made the final.
Why tf are Cork favourites for next year's all ireland after this? Bookies and media stirring the pot already
Cork got more tickets aswell😂😂
Cork goalie had a mare for those 2 goals, should have been nailed on favourite to win that ball for the 3rd goal just didnt commit.
All the smack talk from the rebels before hand just to have that absolute bottle job of a second half, love to see it
Well done Tipperary from a limerick man 👌🏻 Great to see Cork bate, F off back home the motorway cork and stay home, ye haven't the balls, We will be back for ye next year, Don't worry 🫡🫡🫡🫡
I dont know what more impressive Corks capitulation or Tipperary’s second half
Hon tipp
Well done to Tipp. I predicted this result before the game.  This Cork team is totally overrated. They collapsed numerous times when the crunch came on in serious games. They were awful against Clare in the second half this year. They collapsed against Limerick in the Mhc first round. They literally stood up and watched Tipp destroy them. They have no heart when the chips are down.
We have the greatest game in the world...Hurling has everything that a true sportsperson enjoys...Passion, excitement, intensity and most of all skill...
Cork fans, Wayyy too cocky last few years. Deserved that.
John McGrath’s second goal was the best I’ve seen Jimmy Barry Murphy score a similar one way back in the seventies.
Cork.. sort out a section of your supporters, gone into very sickly cocky and disrespectful to other counties. It's been noticeable last few years. Team should be showing more class too. Can't blame other counties or  JP for this. Have some class stay humble and respect others. Massive Karma here.
Congratulations to Tipp on a great win from a Limerick man.
Tipp man here,was in Croke Park yesterday when I sat into my seat beside a Cork woman, she said to me,this is croke Park welcome, I said I no exactly where Croke Park is,I reminded her cork hasn't won All Ireland in 20 years, a bit to cocky I thought, anyway she was gone out of CROKE Park with 10 minutes left in game............i was polite, and said, SAFE HOME..
Watched live on BBC2. What a match. This Englishman is a full on Hurling convert.
If I were a Cork supporter I would be furious . The Players and Management need to apologise to supporters for this farce . 2nd year in a row they have gone into a final believing their own hype and falling flat on their asses .  Also got destroyed in 2021 final  2nd time this year they have got a serious trimming  They need to have a long hard look at themselves 😮
@15:27 That should not have been a red card.
The over confidence was unbelievable last week in Cork quite unbelievable..its an age old problem in Cork, in 1982 I was 18 we couldn't be beaten by Killkenny if half the team played ye will win was the topic Killkenny dished out the same hammering..Tipperary gave a display for all to look back on sheer skill & in there "chests" were pride and honesty all wise now but Cork were lucky to get a piont in Ennis in April that kept our season going that was a second half Collapse too..@paddy 📼 videos 1990s Cork..
If the young fella got sent off in the semi final should’ve he been not there
He might not get a whole lot of plaudits but Willie Connors had some game.. he was everywhere intercepting cork attacks and driving ball forward and picking right pass every time
Me and my son were at the match yesterday and Ronan car was sitting beside my son it was a  Great
Massive congratulations to Tip from limerick 😊
Cork had one attacking  playbook all year and tipp did their homework and worked out how to neutralise it. I said it to my missus all season that teams need to run at the cork backs coz they were useless but every team made them look good. But i think the biggest reason of all that they lost was, the team and fans included, assumed it was a foregone conclusion that the rebels were taking liam home. Just shows that you cant get cocky till after the final whistle on all ireland final day.
Pat rhyne has to go
From the first 10 mins I had a feeling Cork were fumbling the ball and not really focused. Bookies were wrong for once. I would have backed  Cork to win a few grand if they were 4/6. At 2/7 I saved my money. Well done Tipp,  a team with some young guys on the team and deserving winners.
Jaysus, living in CA since 89 and didn’t even know that the game was on. Can’t be bothered watching the highlights now since I already saw the score first.
Up Tipp
As a neutral after last years final I would have liked to see cork win the all Ireland and to be fair to the team they reacted well to the setback by getting straight back to the final this year. However, the past couple of weeks if not more the cork fans thought they’d had the Liam McCarthy trophy already won. They thought Tipperary were just happy to be in the final and they’d blow them away by 10 points or more. The fans claimed they ‘deserved’ the all Ireland. There was even a man got a tattoo to celebrate winning the all Ireland during the week. In sport it’s not about what you deserve it’s about what you earn. At half time even the team seemed to think they’d it won based on that second half performance. They certainly weren’t expecting Tipp to come back at them. What a brilliant performance by Tipperary to come back and win. They deserve the trophy this year. To the Cork fans calling themselves the best fans in the country…in my opinion the best fans in the country would have stayed and supported their team to the end of the game.
Cork were sure of this. What a kick they got
Massive congratulations to Tipp from everyone here in the USA!!!
Pat Ryan isn't the right man for the job, can never get much from his interviews and get the feeling he doesn't really want to be there. A lot of these players need to be made fight for their places
Hurling is a game played with a Sliothar and two Male teams carrying 60 balls. In this game there was a Sliothar but only 30 balls because the entire Cork team don't have any!
Excellent and exciting times for Tipperary hurling. ROLE MODELS OF THE GAME CONGRATULATIONS.
Lets take a moment to think about the cork man that got a tattoo before the game saying , Cork Champions 2025
Absolutely shocking performance from the langers in the 2nd half. Disgrace
Cork got what they wanted they said after Tipp beat Kilkenny 🤣🤣🤣 Let that be a lesson to ye all folks. Be careful for what ye wish for. There were Cork fans saying they were going to win by 10 pts. How can a county be so cocky despite not winning it for 20 years. Hon Tipp ye legends.
Up the feckin premier yeehaw 💙💛
Expect mass suicides down by the Lee tonight. Unbackable favourites given the runaround by a teenager. Tipp were dominant in every position in the second half. Cork becoming a bit like Mayo footballers now. I wonder whose curse they are under? Possibly Donal Og Cusack and Graham Norton have something to do with it.
Hurling. The world's greatest sport. Very difficult to find a live stream in Chicago. Thankful for the Cork radio broadcast.  Appreciate the highlights. Astonishing comeback. Treise leat!
The ref made sure cork didn't score in the second half typical keep the rebels down mentality....we'll be back
Next season quit putting the score in the title ffs
They still have a long way to got to catch the Cats....If it wasn't for Scoregate and the shenanigans, it would have been the Cats 37 title today!
John McGrath is Tipp's Ronaldo!
Why this sport is not popular internationally?
As a neutral fan Jesus Cork had a disappointing 2nd half they’re not a team that should be winning the all Ireland any time soon
Cmon ye boys in blue 😂😂 ye bottle merchants 😎😎
Brilliant match today!!! I believe that this team will only get better and better under Liam Cahill. TIPP TIPP TIPP TIPP TIPP!!!! 🔵🟡💪🏼
Cork giving their best Mayo impression
A Cork fan caught speeding out of Croke Park will get more points than their team in the second half
