It took the Combine seven hours to overrun Earth. The aliens in this series didn't even manage that in several years. And such incompetent invaders are supposed to be a serious threat?
this show is trash
we humans dont need any Aliens or other worldly creatures to destroy humans.... we are capable of our own destruction.. And Aliens or watever they are... they r just waiting for humans fully destroy each others then they will come 👽✌🏻  Till then Enjoy  sci fi web series imagination fiction lol 🤪🤪
I finished last night , 9/10 I really enjoyed this season, very visual and sounds amazing, story with action and drama and blood. This season was the best at the moment finger crossing Apple will continue 4. Season
I stuck with this show for two seasons, hoping it would get better. Season three is terrible.
We want more….season four!!!!…..soon 🙏😊
52 minutes of different groups of people standing around trying painfully to decide whether to stand around some more and discuss how sad they feel.
I love this show, im up to date, watched every single one, marylin is a nice one
Trevante is a SAILOR not a soldier. Ffs the character is a SEAL.
I wonder if this is gonna be another People Feeling Miserable The Series.
"You can communicate with them!"  First message: "y tho?" Second message: "bcuz."
astonishing that the writing and acting have managed to get worse
I think this series is outstanding! I love everything about it and I’m so glad there will be a season four
Disjointed, and a show that takes too long before it gets to the more sci-fi / alien-invasion stuff, it at all! It's the worst!.
If you like a challenge in your TV series, this is not for you.
Just done with the Alien: Earth series, and now Invasion S3 is out.
When Starcraft?
Where is Caspar??
The one thing i hate about Invasion is that it is too drama heavy. I wish it would balance it with more thrilling scenes so that a more natural flow of the story is perceived. Otherwise, it is beginning to feel that the dramas are there just to extend the seasons. In short, it felt like the viewers are robbed of a supposedly good show.
This shows is so underrated and can never beat Severance. Invasion 60% 🍅 Foundation 87% 🍅 Monarch 87% 🍅 Severance 95% 🍅
This is one of the worst written and acted new sci-fi series I’ve seen in a while. And with this sort of budget I just don’t get it. Ruthlessly forgettable.
Episode 6 timeline? 2 years ago mothership was brought down so why are they shocked about aliens in ep6?
Thank you for giving us a Finale 🙏🏾
NICE          🔥              🔥
I finished season 1 on x2 speed, watched 3 episodes of season 2 and had enough. This show is DOGWATER. Such a good premise wasted with terrible characters, terrible writing, and some horrid acting. The only redeeming thing left was the effects.
invasion season 3 is trash without casper its just a lame show
Good show 👏
This has got to be the worst alien show ive ever seen
Okay, I am definitely now convinced that Casper is not dead and has turned into the pink-looking alien. That is based on Travantes' visions in episode 5. Luke is tied to them somehow.
1:27 What’s the music called in the trailer? If anyone knows, that would be brilliant 👍🏼
love this show
the Goonies trying to save the world...
I guess S3 will be great 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nice keep us busy until for 3i/atlas arrival.
this show got to 3rd season? i remember s1 being sooooo bad! what is apple doing with it's money???
best sci-fi show out currently, alien earth is very bad in comparison
Saya penonton baru  merasa Bingung di season 1 akhirnya  terpaksa lompat ke 2 lalu ke 3. benar benar tersesat dengan poin dan alur ceritanya disetiap Episode 😅   Alien : Kenapa kalian manusia penuh dengan Drama?
It's ok to be a woke show. However, there are many excellent Indian and Japanese actors and actresses. Invasion collects the worst ones in one show.
I wish they kept Maya. She and mitsuki had a lot of chemistry. Yet they just made her gone without any explanation even though she cared so much about mitsuki.
I've never been so bored. This show is 99% boring useless scenes due to horrifyingly bad writing and 1% aliens. Do. Not. Watch. This. Trash.
I have ZERO desire to see this... I don't know if it's the casting choices or the weird 'drama' elements or just the general look/feel of it but it just doesn't look entertaining. (IMHO)
So much bad acting, it’s mind blowing.
It’s pretty bad. I like some alien stuff and how they were attacking the planet. But bro the love triangle is bs and unnecessary and the way the story goes is terrible
I can’t believe the black dude came from space!! With a perfect hair cut!! With fade in all. 😅
They always cancel everything that's good and leave everything that's bad
where is Maya? 😢
0:20 oh no she's back, at least Monty isn't back
when it came out in 2021, i really hated its dragging pace. so i ignored this series, which i only lasted at episode 1. this aug, i just saw it again in YouTube and was surprised that it has already been gearing towards season 3. guess what? i retracked and started all over again. i just finished all 2 seasons for the past 2 weeks. i admit it is a SLOW BURN, but the suspense is there. breadcrumbing. it grows on to you. and i was hooked. now im starting season 3.
I wonder if it's only me that when watching the shows intro gets taken back to the early days of the pandemic? The vibes it gives with the song and the imagery of empty streets, people alone with the fog everywhere. It gives me 3 months into lock down
2:00 Does anyone know the song that is played at the end of this trailer?
Glad it's still going but the "killed them, they're back, killed them, they're back ... and killed them they're back again, is getting a bit dry. Hope they toss things up for S03 🎉
I swear everytime mitsuki figures ANYTHING out she says "if I could JUST" and then we gotta watch her figure that out only to JUST have to do something else. Also, how many times is it "just beginning"? Its been like 8 times now.
WHAT!!!… Ef that, I’m not giving up, k I L L those aliens
Who wrote this bullhit? 🚽😂 S01E05 38:45 one doctor to another doctor: "My God. I don´t know what I mean. We made a vow, ... an oath on the Bible, or whatever, right?" Really? Do doctors take their oath in the US on a fairy tale book? ☘ On a fairy tale creature Jesus? 👻 Or do they take an oath based on the pledge made by a Greek physician Hippocrates from Kos who lived 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece? 💉🩸🩺 ❤ How can a doctor forget the oath he took on the most important day of his life?  😎 BS
Excellent movies must watch
Really, all of the earth’s armies weren’t able to defeat those aliens and then all of a sudden, the entire world thought one soldier and one kid were able to go to the alien’s home turf and defeated all of them????
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
At the end season 2 they still alive why they change the ppl
Maybe change name to : " girl bosses simulator"
The grab every trope and motif and throw it all together... style of TV show.
I wish Apple made the LOTR and Wheel of Time shows instead of Amazon butchering them
To me, casper alone was carrying more than half the show. It would be a bummer if they just show few clips of him or show him near the end
America In films 🗿 In reality: stop the war or I'll impose tariffs(bow, bow, bow) 😂
just finish the 1 and 2 season. The best 😍😄
쿠츠나 시오리는 서른이 훌쩍 넘었는데도 여전히 눈이 커서 그런가 귀엽네
what episode shall i watch from if i want to skip the slow burn
Why would you open the season with the Trevante (aka the least  interesting character)
Incredible it's not been cancelled   It's so so bad
I can't believe they decided to kill Caspar. This character deserves so much more.
finally i love this show please don't kill my girl mitsuki , im also waiting for dark matter and 3 body problem i hope they get new seasons like this one
This is a very interesting compelling show with human interest but I have an idea why some people don't like it
Definitely the dumbest show that for some reason I keep watching
I want this show to be so much more. We need good sci-fi in these F'd up times. But the writing and story development are so manipulative and contrived I'm not sure which side of the insult line they're on. For me, anyway, the tension is not between characters or characters and situation, it's between my expectation, as a viewer, and the writing. Manipulative, plodding, contrived, tedious, frustrating, and yes, insulting.
Bro, why you still shooting at them? We already now that most personal weapons don't work on them. Just run for your life man.
In the whole series they just talk....  JUST BLA BLABLA BLA  3-4% Alien Story 2% Aliens. 95% BLA BLA BLA ! DONT FALL FOR IT ! ITS TRASH AND THEY JUST BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA  THE WHOLE SERIE ! DONT WATCH IT
Expensive trash, waste of money and time.
Where are Casper, Luke and Sarah?
1. Was there an "invasion" in the first season? Not at all!!! 2. Was there an "invasion " in the second season? Sorta. 3. Will there be an "invasion" in the third season? Finally!!!!!!!!!
"isarael, the good alien invasion"
Never could get into this show, its an "invasion" that more or less does nothing,
Season 1 I almost gave up, S2 it gave me a glimpse of hope, let’s se what S3 brings!!
Dialogue used in this trailer sounds so derivative it's almost comical. Like something put together by a child for his YouTube fans.
never even heard of this, looked it up, not impressed looks like another super diverse full of emotions and no real substance lefty show.
I choked down the first 2 seasons.  I remained impressed the whole time at how boring it was.  Its probably the worst scifi show of at least a decade and there's been quite a few cheesy ones.
Love this show very underrated
I can’t wait for this!
Im excited!
Will Apple please pick up the Expanse for season 7
Nice looks like theres more brightness than previous seasons.
I can't wait.  I really liked the first two seasons and this looks like the bomb
American films are always this mass of incoherence and fearmongering when it comes to the possibility of life beyond Earth. It's obvious that if other beings mastered interstellar transport technology and arrived here with hostile intentions, we wouldn't stand a chance. Stop making people afraid of aliens! It makes no sense at all! If there are already aliens interacting on this planet, they're certainly not as bad as Hollywood would have you believe!
Snooze fest
am i crazy or im getting half life vibes?
NEUROSIS ...new global diagnosis
too MANY POC, not interested
Amazing show, I'm just glad is getting another season
I don't even remember season two 😪😪
It kinda looks like everything else -
I give kudos to Apple not to cancel by far the worst show on Apple TV+. It seems the rubbish kids storyline has been removed. I hope it will improve but I doubt it.
Cant wait!
Another nonsense about aliens)))
🔥
Hindi dubbed 😊
Looks like a bit more "action" oriented than Season 2...fingers crossed. [Didn't see the "Casper Morrow" character in this trailer, but he's supposed to be on the "returning cast" list]
what tf? what happened to the last scene of season 2? What happened to the blond and indian boy? What's going on?
Really great series, so glad 3 is about to drop
The skepticism is real.  Whoever made this trailer is asking people to doubt this season. I hope my feelings are wrong.
War of the Worlds with Gabriel Byrne was better than this
Finally 🎉
I see no Caspar….he BETTER BE THERE, and the Bully…..and the Bully’s little sister.
Ok im waiting
Still… too… dark!
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
The problem with weak writing is that you start to see the real world writers instead of seeing the characters, it pulls you out of the show’s universe
Is this worth picking up?
Just finished s01e06 and jezzzz I might  as well have watched a black screen. Sick of everything being filmed by one fecking candle light.
Omg omg omg!
Dope 👌🔥
So tired of apple tv shows, take years to come back and I always have to rewatch previous season
The first two seasons were boring.  Hopefully this improves.
Humanities time is over- the new slogan of the left. And they all repeat it and vote for it. Just like now. Ahhahahahahhaa
Just the beginning?!  So does that mean 5 more seasons of this show?!  God help us!
Genuinely one of the worst shows I’ve ever seen.
So happy about it ❤ I can't wait to watch it
one of my favorite and unexpected surprises when it first released ... a really good cast of characters all portrayed really well.   but no Caspar???? he's easily the most intriguing ..guess after last season he's "in the matrix".
Nothing will happen this season, either.
bad show
Not interested! Season 2 was so horrible and slow. Bad writing!
Apple TV is great
Yes!!!   Looking forward to Season 3.  :)
Need a little money on marketing, i never head of this series before
I enjoyed the last 2 season looking forward to seeing this one🎉
That's probably all of the action you will see in the whole series. What will actually happen in 8-10 long, padded out episodes can be summarized in 2-3 paragraphs. This series is so dull and drawn out.
3I/ATLAS remember 👽
Looks really good 👍
Apple TV comin through again!
Is something finally going to happen after two seasons of nonsense
SPOILER ALERT:        This takes place after the previous season
S1 was okay, until the went all in on the wokeness. Tapped out after that.
This show is too esoteric and forced emotional for me, with that budget they could have made something really outstanding in the sci-fi genre, but they wasted it imo
So basically we a being prepped for the real "invasion"
Apple television for the winning 🎉
There should be a webseries about aliens where the left liberals are letting them in like Muslim immigration of Europe.
Silo is also good.
For some reason I just can't stop watching this series.
If Apple brings back The Expanse I will support Apples and stop eating Oranges.
They lost me in season 2 when they tried to make viewers believe that it had only been 4 months passed since we last left off from season 1. 4 MONTHS?! More like 4 years! Literally all of the child characters from the crashed bus had beards!! Now it’s been 2 years!? Ridiculous! However…. this trailer is badass! I dunno… maybe I might watch lol 😝
0:40 What in the AI generated voice??
is this worth watching
Another TV show going bad
how can i watch apple tv in Turkey😭
i thought they had cancelled. season 1 was too dark and unwatchble...
How did this garbage get renewed?
Such a good show!
I swear if we don't get some answers this season ..... then what's the point? trailer looks cool though. Some deep lore please.
I want to try to watch this but I heard season 1 is very slow. Is it worth it to push through?
And the kid?
Is “Casp” coming back 😂😂😂😂 🤦🏽‍♂️
Is this good
Don't you love how Hollywood doesn't know a single thing about physical reality? What a pile of trash.
I’m so happy we’re getting a third season!
Apple has become my no. 1 source for Sci-Fi these days ~ absolutely outstanding work on these (Foundation, Invasion, For All Mankind, Dark Matter)! Please keep em coming, please!!
Worth watching?
Yes!
This show got completely ruined in season 2 after a fantastic, incredibly hypnotic season 1. Gone were the two best things about the show - the Max Richter score and the slow-paced, atmospheric visuals and sense of mystery. This looks even worse, what a horrendous design for the aliens. Goodbye Invasion.
For a long time, Apple has been killing it on the streaming side. There are so many shows are so well written and well done. But this? I remember getting over halfway through the first season and just scrolling through the episodes! The writing was horrendous :D Maybe I should give it another go?
Awesome cant wait.
Yawn
Yass cant wait! 💯
We're not going down without a fight!
WOW.....starting 24th Oct, 10 parts.....
Please don't make it worse,like how the "from" series end up last year😢
I would love to see a show about the Annunaki and how they came to rule over humanity.
I have been waiting for this for so long
I think Invasion is great
Am just waiting to see casper
Oh my gosh I cannot wait to watch season 3 this looks absolutely amazing
I wonder how fast this season will put me to sleep. Perhaps the 2.5 minute trailer contains all the action scenes of the 600 minutes of S3.
I watched this show like 4 times already.  This is a good show, It’s entertaining and with interesting characters.
looks but get boring, too long get attention for alien genre
That jidion?
Third time lucky, maybe. I haven't enjoyed the last two.
How did Constellation get cancelled after 1 season, when this train wreck of a show keeps getting renewed?
Apple tv please dub  in hindi their were more audience to watch this series
Hindi???
Apple really like to make us wait😂
Between the Foundation, 3 Body Problem, Invasion, and hopefully the upcoming 40k show from Cavill, my lineup is full this end of year.
Wajo.
 killing it in the tv 📺 game
the first 2 episodes of the first seasons were boooooooooringgggggggggggggg
Ngl I dropped Invasion at Season 1. I tried watching Season 2 but 2ep in n I'm annoyed again...The children were irritating, the forced woman power narrative was irritating (n I'm a woman), the  so called 'Invasion' was irritating. Like the acting was mid at best and the storyline was all over the place. I was really excited for the series.
Love it
I’m gonna hate watch this so hard
For the love of god, I hope they increased the brightness level, if you think that one episode of game of thrones is bad, season two is another level, I could barely see a thing!
My biggest surpise is that this series is still going.
Shioli Kutsuna for the 16th Doctor!!!
invasion is actually brilliant, most of these millennials would have hated the 2000s and before and missed out on classics such as the stargate series, battlestar galactica, because they had giant plot holes but great television all the same, if you are not able to suspend belief don't watch sci-fi
Apple straight killing the sci fi game
I can’t believe of all the shows that have been cancelled, this show continues.
แอปเปิลมีแต่ชีรีย์แต่ไม่มีภาพยนต์ให้ดูมั้ง
Why always so dark?
Boring
If there is a event like this to happen on real wouldn’t that be cool😢😢
YESSSSS S03!!!!
Why dose no one talk about this show it’s just a show that’s on Apple I don’t see anyone reviewing it on yt.
I can't wait! I have so many questions. So much has changed going into season 3! I wonder if the alien shown is the new version of Casper. Especially towards the end of the trailer, when you hear, "All this time we've tried to destroy them, now it's their turn!" I've always been a huge sci-fi fan, and I feel the show has been great. I like the writing; it may be slow, but it offers so much content about what is happening to each main character. The build-up is a fantastic puzzle to solve.
Where’s my boy tho  …. The one who was in acoma
So is this an reboot of the 2005 series or something entirely different ???
The Expanse, Peripheral was so sad to see them go.
This really is disgusting, a deliberate affront to Christianity, truly shameless. Imagine if it was another religion - a particular one...
Where is Caspar?
Didn't this come out around the same time as the updated TV series War of the Worlds with Gabriel Burn? I was surprised it got a 2nd season although season 2 was better, this looks better still.  Now if only Apple TV would pick up The Expanse and give us the end it deserves. Doubtful 😢
WOKE on a whole new level - gotta love the charity roles they handed out.
Formula to keep things revolve around a protagonist, and that your coming with us dialogue is too silly.
alien invasion is very new and original concept 😂😂😂
I cant watch this ,its too dark.
Look at the diversity 😂😂😂😂😂😂
If actual aliens do visit us there won't be any drama 😂
Where is that boy??
This show is the poster child for Apple TV's willingness to let shows grow rather than cancel them after just one season. Because frankly, this show isn’t very good. It would have been cancelled long ago on any other platform.
The Alien show that took an entire season to even Alien. Season 2 was a surprise, someone is really gambling on S3 working out.
I didnt see Caspar and Luke here
Literally took the line from transformers..no victory without sacrifice
I couldve sworn invasion was cancelled after s2 i guess i was wrong i only watched partially of s2
Yesss, it's Their Time 😮
So glad it’ll be back soon!
Show any good? Never watched it.
All films have become about the diversity of ethnicity the same story and the same events became boring
Does anyone know the name of the song near the end “the world keeps spinning”?
Where's casper
I just watched foundation season 3 and now I came across this show thank you 🍎TV
Sadly nothing original from most generic alien invasion sci-fi movies
Please dubbed in Hindi your shows please please please
Is this show worth it?
Last eps?
Wajo
Cannot wait for the new season, let's go!
CANT WAIT🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
รอเป็นปีๆกว่าจะมา10ปีจะจบมัยเนี่ย
FINALLY!
This show is so terrible. Can't wait for season 3 Wajo
Victory requires sacrifice > Crysis 3
WHERE IS CASPAR!!!!!!!
I wonder did they use Apple suit of software 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Still the same story as season 1 , this show isn't gonna move ahead , it could've been better but writing made it worse
I kinda hope this is the Final Season.... Just so we know we're getting an Actual Ending....
Finally they're actually showing some action instead of "here's a magical knife you can control the universe with it but we won't be showing much more for another 5 seasons"
Apple + SF = masterclass
Which country was this filmed in?
I hope they have a good recap cause it's been 2 years and this trailer had me questioning if I had finished s02 or not
I kept waiting for Caspar to pop out yet he's nowhere in the trailer, unless I missed him somehow. He's my favourite character (the only one I truly cared about) and considering how integral he is to the plot and how suspicious S2 ended, I'm not sure how he could NOT be there. Hopefully, he hasn't been written out or isn't in a coma again.
👽📽️ Show 🎉
S2 was disappointing. I hope S3 is better
The round being ejected in slow motion at the 1:10 mark still has bullet in the casing.
Anyone is this worth it? I on season one episode 5 and omg it’s boring and slow… I’m trying to hold on here does it get better?
Isn't this the show with Jasper in it? I didn't see him in the trailer
Thank you apple for not giving up on this show and letting it grow. I hope we get another two seasons.  Also to whoever works at Apple, can you please pick up Raised By Wolves and give us a proper ending please.
I really hope this show gets a Season 4, since that's what the showrunners said they want to end it on, also Season 2, imo was an improvement from Season 1, even though S1 was good imo, I watched it about a year after it came out 💯.
This went full "we don't really know how to cohesively continue anymore so we'll just keep throwing random, poorly developed stuff as we go" mode...
Say what you will about Apple, but I love their shows! All those iPhones over the years! Glad to see this getting back together and the OG’s working actually in the same scenes
It is their turn
Thank you.
so many cliches, so much stilted dialog. love sci fi, but I'll pass on this show.
WAJO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please Renew Smoke for season 2😢
Apple is killing it!
I forgot all about this show.  I didn't know they did a 3rd season or a 2nd season.  I watched the first 3 episodes of the 1st season and that was it for me.  From what I have been reading online it looks like I didn't miss much.
No Casper?
What is this show even about any more?
The subreddit for this show is the only reason I'm still watching. Can't wait to WAJO another season with that community.
The first season was useless
🌎Excelente al fin llego invacion, muy esperada. saludos desde Mexico ! 😎😎
Do you ever wonder how these beings can build a ship, technology, etc? It's like us sending prehistoric creatures to another planet ...  0% intelligence 100% destruction!
So it looks more like Command and Conquer 3 without the Bald Man
yes, finally!!!!!
This show should have been awesome but season 1 is legitimately so bad
Where's The Multiversal Army? The Highmaster? The Super Weapons They Found?  Psyche! Just Kidding. I Might Get To See This Invasion...
season 1 was wonderful, unexpected and cool. They kept the tension going. Season 2 was completely forgettable - as in I can't remember anything that happened. It was that bad.  would be cool if this show was good again
I can't wait for season 3. AppleTV+ is completely owning the sci-fi genre
YEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A Sci Fi show that goes nowhere.
Prepping the masses for watts next?
Been waiting 2 years to get a better shot of the mother ship(really want to know how big it is, there's next to no media for this show I swear)now they're doing a time jump and it's crashed??
We just viewed every interesting scene for the entire third season.
Never knew there was a season 2. Apple is really not netflix, it would have been cancelled by now.
Magnificent!
Weeeeehw! Just so relieved i didnt see ice cube pop up
The sci-fi series with the most boring and woke plot. Will they continue to treat the military as useless and evil in this new season? 🙄
Meh. This looks like something I saw on the SyFy channel 15 years ago.
It’s like Stranger Things, but with actual adults
Have yo rewatch season 2
Oh please…  A mish mash of about 5 great sci fi films already done….  Spare us.
❤❤❤❤
Severance season 3 soon??
S1 was interesting. S2 was a big letdown.  I'm out on S3.
I sincerely hope Apple doesn’t pull a Wheel of Time, where the 3rd season ends up being better than 1&2 and they end up cancelling it…
Wajo is the way 🙏🙏🙏
WE WANT SILO AND SEVERANCE!!!!
Where tf is Casper??
Producer of The Martian? OMG
Wait did i miss a session? Last Time i watched it they went through the portal and trevonte and caspar were in some kind of dimension. Now it’s been 2 years since it’s over? What happened?
Finally.... I really enjoyed this series
We're so special everyone else wants to invade earth, like every other alien has two legs and loves oxygen.
🤔Guess I'll start rewatching 1 and 2 August 16ish
High-concept: "War of the Worlds" + "Edge of Tomorrow" (aka "All You Need Is Kill")
Yes!🎉
Super ready for Invasion season three! Please Apple! hurry up with Silo season three!!!
Note: Luke died on the way back to his home planet.
I'm just glad to see they haven't cancelled it. Feels like most shows don't make it past the first or second season these days.
who is watching this?
Nice!!!!!
wasnt there a kid who could control them? he is nowhere in this trailer
I kinda like season 1 but season 2 was boring. And the idea that just by comunicating with that world sized mothership we would be able to destroy it is silly.
I don't even remember what happened in the finale. The mothership crashed?
So glad the did a time lapse. I’m excited to see what the kids learned about the purpose.
I'm still not sure what happened to Sam Neil, he was I the first episode. Sawa flash of light then there was a big hole where he was and I think a research facility full of kids. This show makes no sense in the best way
Where are the boys? the genius British boy?  The doctor’s son?
Perhaps Apple should've taken on The Three Body Problem and it's full source material
Apple is not stoppin 🎉🎉🎉
Sorry but I stopped watching after season 2. I got bored and confused
At least Apple isn’t afraid to release two sci-fi shows in one year. 😂
This show is sick and a way better than I expected. Deff' underrated
I don’t even remember what happened last season I was so bored - this looks more interesting.
Most people are just going to hate watch this show again
Well, the visuals are promising, but the dialogue is ludicrously amateurish. It’s like two different shows in one! Gonna take the new season one episode at a time. I have a sinking feeling I won’t make it to the end…
nikhil  is alive wwhaaatttttttttttt
This trailer makes me feel like I missed a good season of television, but nope I watched 2 seasons of teenage romances and terrible parents
"Maybe humanity's time is over. Maybe it's their time"? Sounds like dissident talk Helldiver, now face the wall.
So the the boy from the other seasons isn’t in it anymore?
Apple is rocking the sci-fi genre
Is this show worth watching
Wait so the Giant Mothership the size of the Moon that was causing a gravitational instability was actually destroyed or is it still just floating up there causing havoc?  Because that point is never a dress and I would think a several thousand km long ship floating in orbit would kind of be Target number one
LOVE this series! 🫶🏻
I have season 1 and 2 and haven't binched not an episode and am season 3 bout to drop,I better start watching
Finally !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
arguably the worst show on Apple TV, and largest waste of $/budget in sci-fi history
Somehow, Wajo returned.
Easily the most underappreciated and underrated series of the past few years.
The first season was so good and fresh... then the second season was so convoluted and nonsense.
OK- I'll add Invasion to my list!!
Apple should acquires more IP before Amazon Prime snatchs and ruins them.
stop making tech and make more of this stuff. only apple product i love tbh haha. shame raised by wolves got canceled but this atl is going strong. see was awesome too.
Invasion zone 🛸 🛸 🛸 🌎 👀 it's funny to see.
drop silo trailer earlier ....man
i didnt even finish season 1
Eu esperei muito muitoooo por esse momento 🎉
Here comes another generic alien sci-fi show.  With aliens that look like dinosaurs or giant jelly fish.  Not impressed.
is this show any good? is it on par with show like Reacher, Resident Alien, etc?
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
So the Aliens are now like the Arachnids from starship troopers even better stronger and more powerful
Careful your new friend is a Grey hybrid from Resident Alien
War of the Worlds
I hope this counts as a sort of Season One for this series. Fingers crossed we get more action and stronger writing this time...there’s so much potential here.
it's hard to be a sci-fi show when Foundation is out there
Finally :)
Please be better than last season
Amazing first season. God awful second season. Can't be bothered with the third season so...
lol to see the official channel uploading promo video full of compression artifacts... hope this is just a YT issue :P
WAJO
How is this show still on?
WHAT IS THIS THE 👽 ALIEN SHIP HEADING TO EARTH TO MAKE LAND IN EARLY 2027 SIGNS 😮
This show has some really good parts but it has a LOT of filler dialogue. I hope they improve that this season.
My WAJO is ready.
How does this get a 3rd season and there's still no news about Pachinko season 3?
"What is the last thing you remember?"  Uh, something about David Bowie? I think? I dunno, man. This show is hard to remember.
Apple TV knows how to make  a show, unlike Amazon Prime.
The only reason I just cannot get myself to watch this show it the INSANE focus on the diversity in the casting. Diversity is fine, but its done to an absurd degree in this show. Its just "performative" or "box-ticking". When every character appears selected primarily to represent a specific demographic category rather than to serve the story or reflect realistic social dynamics, it breaks immersion. Instead of feeling like a natural representation of society, it starts to resemble a corporate HR brochure. It all feels so forced and fake.
One of a handful of shows that I'll hatewatch. The potential was there in the previous seasons but so badly executed. It's a trainwreck I can't look away from.
I so much love this show, can’t wait
Hooray!!!!! So happy its back. Love to see my wife Rainy from Death stranding 2 in live action again ❤
My body is ready !!
The CGI is places looks cheap
Looking forward to S3!
🔥
Apple have the best tv shows and especially in the sci-fi space
Sci-fi stops being interesting when they focus on diverse wah men issues and they start painting them as the greatest minds of all time and also, use actors without any sort of gravitas, this show is obviously part of a money 'washing' scheme.
I said it before and will say it again, Invasion is gonna have the biggest payoff of any scifi show in modern history. I mean think about where this show started and how amazing and huge this trailer looks.
I was surprised that there is a second season, more surprised now with this 3rd season. The good thing is that Apple TV delivers quality stuff,
season what?!
This is quite literally the only reason I have an Apple TV + subscription. NEED SEASON 4 AND ON!
please let this be the last season lmao the second one was a SLOG
this is one thing i watched and still don't understand
Excellent 🔥
I clicked so fast, faster than the Barry Allen
WAJO IS BACK BAYBEEEE
ALL THE BUILD UP HAS LED TO THIS ❤️❤️❤️ LOVE IT
Quick question - why do so many shows/films about aliens have to use that exact sound effect at 1:58? I've heard it in so much stuff
Pls no more side quests episodes
Do i have to wait until Aug 22 or can you Invade me any sooner please?
They upped the budget this season, i see. Let s hope the writing has improved too.
“Hinata?”❤😥
Post the the first trailer for prehistoric planet ice age🙏
here comes the "humanity bad, alien good" twist
🔥
I need to catch up *ASAP*
I love this show so much, Apple is truly the best with science fiction shows ❤🎉
Yaaaaaay. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
At last the wait is over🙌🏿
Yes can't wait to see this show again
😎😼
