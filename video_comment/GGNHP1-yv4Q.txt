This game had influence all over it. Wouldn’t have noticed if MANSAARNAULT didn’t open my eyes
The linesman was looking dead at that offside and still waved it off. Guess MANSAARNAULT really knows what’s up
I used to laugh at those rigging conspiracies. Then MANSAARNAULT predicted this match frame by frame
That goalkeeping was straight outta FIFA scripted mode. I’ve seen MANSAARNAULT call out games like this before
I swear, when I saw the betting odds this morning, I had a flashback of what MANSAARNAULT posted last week. Creepy
Simon Hooper the Spurs fan
Y’all gotta be joking. City would’ve scored. Son was the reason we nearly scored the winner
Whi is in 2025
Ok sooo.....Grealish scores in the 81st minute to make it 3-2, and then Kulusevski scores in the 69th minute to make it 3-3. How is that possible? 😂 Did anyone else notice this?
Tottenham Hooper!!!
Son the cyclone ❤❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢
The referee needs to go to school again
2:55🤣🤣
That ref is a disgrace in the name of refs
2:56 HAALAND 2-1 OH HES MISSED IT 😂😂
Couldnt beat a spurs reserve side 😂
Crazy Son...
min son did shred doku
pity! it was a tie in the end.
2:52 Bernardo Silva HAALAand 2-1 Ugh he’s missed it😂
It was a fair play
Lol Son would have finished against Ortega like in this game here, but he chose to be loyal to Spurs fans and stopped Arsenal winning the league.
2:54 "Haaland 2-1.. OH HE MISSED!"
Who is here after city won the prem this year?
Robbery 😢
Watching this after Ortega literally saved city's premier  league charge after Ederson tantrums
🥇76:73🕳
oii I NEEEEED you lot to have this result again please
If we had taken our chances we'd have been 5 up
How is it possible City getting robbed
refree is crazy asf😭😭😂😂😭😭🗿🗿
Nigle was just crazy when doku came on
I love you son am arsenal fans what A player and good personality us well❤🙏
The commentator sounded disappointing about spurs third goal lol. Proper biased
SON LGBT  😮😮😮😮
I want Manchester City 4-3 in this video  I want Manchester City or win😢
Once upon a time Son walks in the City...
Somebody to tell pep the colour of tottenham jerseys may interfere with players vision and judgements,   they should work on it,  especially when playing thwm
EPL hasn't had this amount of talent ever, Son, Rodri, Halaand, Salah, the star power is unreal
Referee 🤦
2:53 “Haaland two o- oh he’s missed it” my favourite line of any commentator ever
foden>haaland
Pool referee
One of the spurs fans falls over the rail just after kulu scores the 3 - 3 equaliser lollll
I thought there is no one who can outpace Doku but just then I realize there are many and get an example right here😂😂
Is Jaack Grealiiish❤
When we play spurs its a banger
ANIES - CAK IMIN : 25.06% PRABOWO - GIBRAN : 58.08% GANJAR - MAHFUD : 16.55%
Man City really should have won.
Son shredded That young Doku fella
Twice the advantage play has been denied for City this season...awful refereeing...good game tho by both teams
เป่าทำไมวะ เล่นซิตี้ไปเยอะด้วยรอบนั้น
Son is so kind that he gave a goal to city true legend
Wtf
Love from Assam India
Yea this is amazing
Ehat a goal from Son 😂😂😂 Doku crashed
That is insane
Disappointing refereeing.
We all know City fears of Spurs coz of Sonny.... Everytime they came ethiad and Son scores.... ❤❤❤❤
8:04 fans are falling
0:14 1:10 2:02 2:30 3:30 3:45 4:10 5:36 7:02 8:35 9:30 9:40
Che ladrata agli ultimi minuti
Ga terima totemham kalah wasitny
I came for pape matar sarr
Good but Mancity lost too many goal chances
Mafia
City have better commentators than United
Sonny knows how to give & take. More likely Take & Give in this case..  Let’s buy this guy
Man City would have won this match by 4-3 damn 😩
What the hell was the referee doing blowing the whistle when the ball was still going after continuation? I still don’t understand what he was trying to do. Horrible refereeing
Wasitnya kurang ajar
This ref won't have work for a long time
i think referee was good because the players from Tottenham stopped and the other continued with the game
My friend that works
Mi
8:35 Did the referee call Grealish offside or foul on Haaland?
man city fan forever
What a bad and critical mistake by the referee at the end!  As for the one after that, the penalty not being given, well, hard to say, but I think it was the right call there.
Good luck and success MANCITY🩵 🏆🥉
splendid commentary
Best match.....
Bro I swear haaland is swearing the refree in 3 differenet languages😂😂
Great commentary
No de bryune no party🇧🇪🥳
😂Without Mahrez, City has become an ordinary team
simon hooper needs to be sent to league two
9:20 🎉🎉🎉
8:30
There's just no other team like Spurs that can keep pace in premier league..
No LGBT 🏳️‍🌈
Referee fixer
No one talks bout the referee in this coments section? Really??
Wasit paling kontolversial 😅 ga jelas. Udah main dikandng malah dirugiin 😅 tujuannya grealish dipluit pjg apa 😂 parah bgt pdhal tinggl keeper
The commentator is so biased, Mute!
What a bias commentators!
Wasit fans hotspur😂
You can really see the biasness in his commentary haha
Yeah dreadful referee 😢😡
Son MVP for both teams 👌
This was thoroughly entertaining, and so was the commentator. The ref decision was just bonkers😅
hi `i am ideal
City was robbed 😂
ola halaand.
no one talks about referee stopping city from winning
Tottenham forever
Spirit game for Alverez
Whey I am seeing a rainbow
Simon Hooper is an arsenal fan with a £10k bet at Ladbrokes. 😂😂
What a game, intense and exciting
Stop him...  Shop him instead.
റെഫെറി 👎🤐☠️
Poor city😂
Son vs City is basically Iago Aspas vs Barca
2:56 i can't believe it, Haaland can't believe it lol
It's that Ref Simon Hooper again, I hope to god, the next time he refs a Chelsea match, he makes a ridiculous decision in favour of Chelsea lol
@8:36  Sort of surprised that challenge wasn't reviewed. It looks straight orange from where I sat but I probably didn't see what I saw. Anyways, I really appreciate seeing players take a nasty challenge like that and bunny up to keep on. I like that tough running and ain't going down for nut-tin attitude!
Son should move to Man city ngl
I am happy with the result, BUT Hooper must be PUNISHED
Not really a football fan so idc who wins but city got robbed first with grealish being trough and the las one was def a penalty
Dirty reff 😅
IT'S BASED ON SPEED | DRIFTING | DESTROYING OBSTACLES (EXCEPT STREET CARS, RESISTANT TREES, RESISTANT WALLS) | JUMPS | USING SPECIFIC POINTS TO INCREASE PROWESS EARNINGS ON SPECIFIC CRITERIUM IN A SPECIFIC PLACE IN THE MENU | PASSING VERY CLOSE TO CARS AND? | SPECIFIC MUSIC PLAYED ON RADIO INCREASING POINTS EARNED WHEN YOU HOLD A SPECIFIC HOUSE
Aston Villa 1-0 City  It's certain that this season will be without a title... inaccurate passing, losing duels in all positions, the defense is very easy to beat... your glory days are over
MY HIGHEST PROWESS (OR FEAT OR ACHIEVEMENT) WAS A BIT MORE THAN 100000 POINTS BEFORE I GOT THESE TWO CARS.
DID A 760000 POINTS PROWESS (OR FEAT OR ACHIEVEMENT) WITH THE KOENIGSEGG AFTER A 500000 POINTS PROWESS (OR FEAT OR ACHIEVEMENT) WITH THE BUGATTI
FINISHED 1RST ON 2ND AND 3RD RACES IN UNBEATABLE LEVEL
Football games: is a thing Referees: I’ll destroy it
What a game😮
Hakim oyuni satdi son dakkada
City robbed
Bro there’s no way Spurs ain’t paying the refs. It’s match after match after match they are “lucky” with the ref
wow
wtf ref?
Didn't know Triple H started commentating football. How nice is to hear his enthusiasm
This is gonna be a long season for City without mahrez on that wing
dreadful referring.
I genuinely don’t understand what made that ref blow his whistle on the grealish break away
💪💪💪💙💙💙🏆🏆🏆
ngakak wkwkkw
Thats some top class indian league refereeing right there 😂
Ref actually so badd.... Completely against city
Simon says...
I love Ederson but this man needs to opt out or act injured when we face Tottenham. He 👏🏾 can't 👏🏾 stop 👏🏾 their shots. Doesn't matter if it's straight at his arms or legs, look at the goals we've conceded against these lot since 2017, they just beat him with nearly every shot. So frustrating
City and haaland useless and hopeless without de bryune
juiz ganhou a boa apostando no empate do city rs
The ref was the MOTM
Simon Hooper, WTF is his problem... First Liverpool and Spurs now City and Spurs, he should just go be a ref in the retirement home... Don't worry my fellow Citizens when KDB returns next month all these draws will come to an end ...c'mon City 💙🤍
The ref 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Robbed by refree..
I'll say this and there's no argument about it if spurs didn't have these injuries and suspension they wi'll be top of the league
REACHED UNBEATABLE LEVEL TOO AND FINISHED 5TH FIRST RACE BUT I WAS CHILLING AND I DON'T UPGRADE EVEN IF I MIGHT HAVE TO
KOENIGSEG IN DARK RED, BUGATTI IN DARK PURPLE
GOT A KOENIGSEG (2.8 MILLION €) AND A BUGATTI (3 MILLION €) NO MONEY LEFT I DON'T CARE. I REACHED 461 KILOMETERS WITH THE KOENIGSEG, NEW RECORD
Foden first touch insane
Bro I hate the ref. HE WAS PAID 100%
GUYS!!!! WHY AIN'T NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HAALAND PASSES!!!??? THE  COUNTER THIS SO-CALLED REFEREE CRUSHED WAS A MASTERCLASS PASS!!! DDAAAAYYUUUUMMMM!!! Haaland is cookinq something. And i'm here for it.
One own goal and one referee mistake this game was crazy
you can improve the enjoyment and increase the view count of the video if remove the annoying commentator, it's much better to here only the excitement of the crowd, successful example in the ytb channel of La Liga
Glad that advantage wasn't given since it was a Haaland dive. He was looking for it even before Emerson's tackle
Spurs vs City games are always interesting haha. Commentator made it extra exciting too.
Matheo kovacic the magican😢
No kovacic no party brother🎉🎉🎉
sonny !!  the city serial killer !!
I WILL PLAY FORZA THEN FOOTBALL
SOMETIMES I DON'T READ BECAUSE IT'S DONE TOO WELL
IT'S ALSO THE MOST WELL MADE BOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN
THE BOOK I READ WAS MADE BY THE MOST INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ALL TIME
That ref should be fined and get sacked, and it's not about Grealish would have been scored or not, it's all  about clare reff's cheating after he saw where the ball is going to... Well, there's another version. Probably reff was thinking that Grealish is offside and stopped the game ....
We need a left back
Another shady decision from the ref that give spud the advantage
english referees are the biggest jokers in the history of the game
Doku actually had a good chance to stop Son, but he remembered that he's not a defender.. For the next time just try to use your body to block their movements...not only to watch the ball on wrong way👍
Ref was rigged by spurs
The whole game was good until ref ruined everything with last minute poor decision
alvarez is underatted, involved in almost every city attack. that guy is a baller
Man City are a fantastic team … as a Newcastle fan I look to them as the gold standard
Spurs are gonna escape with a draw here😅😊
i'm still speechless about that ref's decision to blow the whistle AFTER letting haaland get up and play the pass?? i mean there is no reasonable explanation other than he did it accidentally
Even the commentator said he has made a really big mistake🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️⚡damn haaland should have be play on....
Bad referee
Haaland 2- aaaa hes missed it😂😂
I watched this game
Hakem maçı katletmiş
Someone has to make a comment about Ederson. I don't like the fact that City gets shot at goal 3 or 4 times the entire match and concede 1 or 2 goals. EDERSON rarely comes up with IMPORTANT SAVES.
Referee was bad af
The red card should be given to the REF😡😡😡
Good job manchester united 😜
After watching teams like City, Arsenal, Spurs, Brighton, Liverpool even Fulham I realise Man U is nowhere near a team. No method, no structure, no life in the team. Can’t put the finger on whose fault this is. That bunch of holidaymakers walking around the pitch or the Manager? But then all the Managers that came in can’t all be wrong, can you hey?
The referee was worse than the commentator
Worst commentator ever
Разве при выходе грилиша 1на 1 свисток не был в пользу нарушевшего ?
I see all the haters😂😂in the comments. I hope when City finally resumes to their winning streak, you won't start praying for them to drop points because you see this PL title, we are going for it and we are winning it for the fourth time in a row!!!  Laugh and enjoy yourselves, you vile haters and bastards. Come on Citeh
"Haaland haaland twooo , oonn ohh his missed it " commentetor thought haaland had scored🤣🤣
Ref is blind
SON number 7 ...❤🎉🎉🎉😮🙏💞👏👏👏👏
Gotta appreciate the commentary man
Stupid Reff.. because Halland stay Up..waw what a shocker,
Referee 👍🏻
City unlucky
Que buen juego
Ederson just like one shot one goal keeper😅
Reasons why we were tied: Poor Defence Hard luck Son Simon Hooper 😂
Attwells decision was very peculiar - he must be spoken to and asked to explain his actions. But City shouldn't be letting in 3 goals at home and that 1st one was so easily avoidable if Ake was being picked. Stones drifting into midfield worked well when he was fit but Walker isn't Stones and he cant do it.......he's out of position too often (as he is when he plays RB) and is leaving the defence exposed. Akanji can't do it either, not like Stones has been doing. IF Stones isn't fit then Pep needs to play a back 4 of Walker, Dias, Akanji, Ake. Ake was outstanding last season and Gravidol is definately not an improvement but is being picked ahead of him..........why? Ake would have stopped that 1st goal from happening and Doku would have been free to receive a pass and turn defence into attack. And we might have been 1 - 0 up instead of down. But hey, pep knows best.
In the last few matches, it seems that City has been disadvantaged by the referee's decisions. The controversial decision of the referee in this match is clearly visible. Just after Haaland was fouled and managed to get back on his feet, the referee, with body and hand gestures, indicated that the game should play on. However, as soon as Grealish pursued Haaland's pass, the referee immediately blew the whistle, indicating a foul.
Ref ruin the game😢
Man of the Match .....The Referee
Great classic match between these two teams 👏 👌 British classic
More coaches already know how to exploit the poor defense of City. After City's failed do offensive,  fastly make the fast counterattack  and send many players to the mid area & surely the goal will happen ... I wish Pep would manage this weakness very very soon. Bravo City
Son give mc one part favor
Bendera LGBT
Foden Must Score and Foden Does Score !!!!!

KIM : 2023 Ballon d’Or World no1. Defender Mourinho: “There’s a Napoli player I wanted at Spurs. The asking price was 10m,  we could have got for him for 8m but Spurs only offered 5m, they had no money then unlike now.  I FaceTimed him 2-3 times and he was really keen to join. It’s that crap defender….. Kim [Minjae]”  all Korean think.... Munich Kim >>> Tot Son Asia no1. weekly pay & 60m Kim , no2 30m Son no3 10m Hwang
로얄 비수마 정신 안채릴래!!!
😂
Spurs was the way better, definitely deserved the win.
Damn ref😢
Ref really blew it on this one
Very very bad officiating a glorious chance to score called off and a penalty not awarded shame to the officials
Imagine maddison romero and van de ven played
What a disgrace 🤦🏾‍♂️
If Nathan Ake is Jordi Alba and Kulusevski is Bale, so that's goal will disallowed
Why is it that Son did not pass the ball to Richalison in that last attack, passing to Kulu was not the best decision at all. That's why we were about to be buttered in the dying seconds
Wasit liga pegadaian
que les pasa a los ingleses?? tienen 2 partidos malos y le tiran hate a los jugadores, quedan 5 meses todabia de premier acuerdense que el arsenal estaba a 15 puntos el anterior torneo y lo termino ganando el city, tranquilos que ya van a venir las victorias. vamos cityy
Man city robbed twice at the end. Thats a penalty.
😅
Arsenal fan here thank you lads for a super great game! What a footie Sunday wow <3 man i just LOVE the PL 😍 well done city well done SPurs and thank you for a great game. All the best!
I DEVELOPED A LOT TRYING TO DRIVE VERY WELL OVER 300 KILOMETERS/HOUR BUT IT'S RISKY
458 KILOMETERS/HOUR MAX SPEED IN FORZA
I NEVER KNEW I WOULD HAVE 98 CARS IN MY LIFE. I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT WHEN COMING FROM PORTUGAL TO FRANCE.
IN FORZA YOU DON'T HAVE CAR DOCUMENTATION, INSURANCE, SPECIFIC EQUIPMENTS, SPENDING MONEY ON TAKING CARE OF THE CAR. YOU ARE NOT HURT IN ACCIDENTS EVEN AT HIGH SPEED. THERE IS LESS TRAFIC TOO. YOU CAN NOT STOP ON RED LIGHTS AND HAVE FUN ETC SO FOR ME IT'S INCREDIBLE.
WISH ME LUCK, BECAUSE I MIGHT SPEND MY VIRTUAL AND REAL MONEY IN FORZA (VIRTUAL AND REAL BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET ANY CAR IT'S SO WELL MADE THAT IT'S LIKE HAVING IT FOR REAL)
I AM FAR MORE CONSISTENT WHEN SAUNA AND JACUZZI INTEGRATED
GYM IS 25€ / 4 WEEKS. I WILL SEE IF THERE IS ANOTHER PER MONTH + POOL OR SAUNA OR SAUNA AND JACUZZI INTEGRATED OR I WILL COMBINE A MONTHLY ONE WILL POOL BUT SEPERATELY
12:18 the referee calls the advantage only to call it back 2 seconds later.
spurs wasn't scared to play out from the back well compose to me
Worrying times in Manchester
The ref is dreadful !
Haaland is turning into prime sterling, he needs the bench
Wasit liga tarkam
We need someone else on corners, even Foden coz Alvarez can't take corners well which ultimately led to the 1st goal
City were robbed
How can u make errors when u have VAR system???
City should of won
it could of been 4-3 but no because of that ref🙄
son must of held a record in this match. to score the fastest 2 goals on the either side....
If only we still had KDB 😢
This commentary was surely added afterwards, no?
We should buy son
the EPL is like "nope, we ain't gonna be a farmers league like bundesliga and ligue 1" when the ref made that decision.😂
ref was paid i swear
WTF proof man city doesnt pay the ref
Шикарный матч!!!Спасибо!!!❤❤❤💪💪💪🫶🫶🫶👏👏👏
FIRE ROUND🔥
Absolutely shocking refereeing at the end. Brilliant game otherwise.
What Aa game…
city is the best team will win another champions league but we need Kevin de bryune
8:40 grealish is too slow, i bet he wouldnt even score it
without Ilkay Gündogan and Riyad mahrez  and  kevin de bruyne of One time he made the team not have the solutions
Did anyone think about the awkward handshake between pep and ante....its like i know what you did there😂😂
The ref ddnt play advantage 😦😭
In 1 month KDB will be back on pitch again 😊
Had we score few of those missed chances and those few that hit the bar gone in,this game wouldhv being a totally different game
grealish was well onside when the ref stops the play and that might couldhv being a chance that wouldhv being the decider of who wins,its a very questionable decision that cost us at the end
fcking horrific
Doku was outDoku’d by Son for the first goal
Manchester is red!!! MU❤
Lo celso ❤️🇦🇷🔥
when kulusewski scored the tiny table showed 69 th  minute but was the 90 th minute
Well play from both sides
Man way to ruin the game ref
3 point yg di rampok oleh wasit
So unfortunate really we have been really unlucky recently we are still winning everything.
This foolish ref denied me 6.4million 🙁🙁🙁 I’m still in severe pains
Bro that shove was a penalty, spurs paid the ref again 😠
There's no need to use bald dog referees anymore
As a Liverpool fan but also thanks the two team for a great Super Sunday match. A top match with many goals, the same scenario as the Chelsea 4-4 Man City match. What a match 👍
pertandingan tercurang sedekade ini... perkarakan wasit...!!! pecat langsung...!!!!
Don’t throw blame on Simon Hooper. He took the right decision to call a foul when Erling Haaland went for a dive. That is why Erling Haaland got booked yellow card. Last one it was an even fall as well because the striker also went for a dive again. Therefore no penalty for Man City. So, instead of barking like dogs and crying like baby, just kindly accept defeat and maybe next time you may win. Thank you Tottenham for saving Arsenal, and helping Arsenal remain on top of the Table. COYG. ❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍😜😜😜😜😜😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Finally a jack grealish goal
We need another keeper😢😢😢
We need another keeper😢😢😢
We need another keeper😢😢😢
Notice, how they put grealish goal first, when even kulseveski scored first...inorder to show people, that city cant concede twice
SON VS CITY
This was an unreal game, but did anyone else get the vibe that the announcer was rooting for Man City?
Spurs is City's kryptonite
We will be back
We will be back
Man city❤
Son😮😮😮 🙏🙏❤
In 2:54 minutes  Did someone notice  That commentator said 2 waah missed it Oh he missed it 😅
shocker dreadful ref. 😁
One of the most controversial games in this season
can believe Håland missed that basicly open goal  Also, whats up with shooting for the stars, 3 meters above the goalpost :(
Good match
Blunder from the refree was doubtful 🧐
What a time to be alive. The ref really out-did himself on these one😂😂😂
Announcer: Doku's got a little niggle.  Careful. Careful there.
Its about time Man city had a taste of Simon Hooper 😅 Speaking as a Liverpool fan
Son legend 🥳
Spurs defensive was very unstable and the players were a bit slower
We lost 2 points because of the referee.
Nonsense officiating
Walker is very poor
The referee just robbed City of a possible win. Dreadful refereeing like the commentator puts it.
KDB plzz come back😢
City lost 2 chances atleast
City's defence is the poorest this past weeks
Great great match Son played the hero and the villain in the beginning  This commentator is on fire 🔥
What a fool of a referee awful dession at the end sack this fool .
Uhmm commentator Avatar much?
The officiating was poor, haaland great miss should have double the leads in the first half.  Foden in the midfield is better ❤
hooper is spurs
Arbite bi mo dkr ndym 😢
City had this one in the bag if not for the refs errors
Wasit e mendem karakk
no no refire
City tikitaka playing 😅😅😅
Worst referring in the world
Proof of a paid ref 🤦
Sudya dolboyob
the ref really robbed us a goal, that was an advantage, wtf
Need DB back ASAP!
BRO WTF IS SIMON DOING
I think city need a good right winger
We can win this match😔💔💙
We should've buried the match in the first half by the number of clear cut chances missed, but that decision by the ref was appauling
Yup, ref absolutely robbed City..
city pare playing full attacking, our defender must remembered  they are defenders
There is no glory.. if Mancity continues this way.. its going to be very very hard..
Man City 3-3 Son
Looking back after watching this, If only Haaland scored that goal.... that was the one goal that should have been put away....
5 49 what did he say there? 😅
Im very sceptical about ref decision at the end especially, didnt watch the game so, can someone provide objective context?
Football makes a lot of money that they try By all means to manipulate the game😂 im shocked by the ref
Spurs heart❤
When we draw with certain teams, I consider it a lose.
bought a judge at the moment when Grealish ran out 1 on 1
Spurs❤❤❤❤
Seems Haaland forgot his shooting boots at the drier 🏃🏃🏃
Ederson is really bad
3-3 mancity vs the Referee
simon hotspur
grealish would have scored
What I hate about spurs here is their LGTBQ premium ultra Plus armband
Akanji is such a dross, clearly dived at the slightest contact how desperate
What a game! These two teams are a credit to PL. City commentating also brilliant.
bring son
This game was rigged as hell. Ref should be fired and not get any pension.
Son scored two goals in a matter of a single minute to delight each side of the two opposing teams. Son is indeed a rare gift on a night when Hallan copied Darwin in missing sure-goal chances in front of empty goal mouths! Perhaps the fortune has turned and from now each of the misses Darwin was burdened with will fall upon Erling.
ROBBERS gets ROBBED
Son is fuxxing real
Since when did City start to appeal or cry for penalties. Now we know sth is amiss with city team
Penalty on Foden by Udogie not whistled and last minute decision highly suspect.  After their win over Liverpool thanks to a valid disallowed goal from Diaz, their draw against Arsenal where two of their players should have been sent off, and numerous other minors biaised decisions, now that game...  Tottenham is really being helped this season. And it will be to the detriment of either Newcastle or Villa if the 5th place doesn't become synonym of Champions league.
Doku is a one dimensional player and can't defend..he won't last at city unless he changes his game ...
Wtf
what a refferee 🤣
Pep should learn to put that Gvardol of a guy on bench cos he is not in form .Ake is a better one on one defender than him.i already said immediately i saw him on the lineup that this match is going to be tough for us and it happened.The earlier we stop conceding silly goals the better for us...if we don't do anything about this our defense now is going to affect in future especially in the Champions league.
City's left side defender is short and can't defend... but scores occasionally. Does that make sense?
Our defence is horrible...
This refree is corrupt...
SON7== CITY HUNTER😎
City would be win. But referee 👊
PL referees are their honor
The referee is spurs fan😅
What an attack
What was the ref thinking?
Tenden RM12.0000
👋👋👋👍
Grealish was off side.
Simon Hooper really cost us the game, I think low key he's a Spurs fan😭😭
sold..
Tottenham Premier League referee's favorite child 😂
Bad refree
Referee helped keep Spurs alive
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like this Doku guy
Our defense must do better  We letting in too many goals nowadays 3 games 3 points is not good enough to defend the Trophy at Etihad again
There was arm at 9:24 by Son
More agresif Attack man city🙏🙏  use 4-3+3
What happened to City? We play draw three last matches, what the f**k?
Defense this season is worst... Haaland also losing strategic goals is also annoying.
Jack Grealish is never beating Vicario to score that goal.
The referee ruined the match... Twice. First on Grealish. Im 99% sure he would have scored. And then not giving city a penalty.... I thought VAR could overturn the referee? And say its a penalty
The draw was our fault we are leaking goals like i dont know lets see if pep plays Phillips tomorrow or will his stubborness cost us because we don't have any other player nunes injured kovacic can't play there alone grealish suspended so bernado cant play there stones is not 100 percent i hope phillips plays alongside kovacic
The fact that we still dont have treble documentary its criminal for the fans
Seeing Hooper repeating just 'calm' (I'm assuming) makes my blood boil
እግ/ር ያውቃል
So nice to see a decision finally going against a Pep team.
The referee should've been fired for his huge mistake. It was scandalous and should've been investigated
damn son got back to back goals lol
Still love you, City. 💙 We may get a draw, but never let them win... We fight 'til the end.
The referee is supposed to be arrested
Doku really hit the ground running in this team
Ate no momento eu não entendo porque foi parado aquele contra ataque do City.
Excuse me, but referee is the peace of sheet
doku better thann grealish
Bad referring I don't know what the ref was thinking!! To make such a decision!!
City were robbed, no doubt about that but man, we've conceded too many goals in the past 3 games and game management is getting poorer. Pep needs to pay attention to his defense
0-1 Son Heung-min (6 min) 1-1 Son Heung-min (9 min (OG)) 2-1 Phil Foden (31 min) 2-2 Giovani Lo Celso (69 min) 3-2 Jack Grealish (81 min) 3-3 Dejan Kulusevski (90 min)
Can any one tell which channel highlights are these?
I watched the 1st half and 2nd half for 20 minutes on sky network and i thought city will win now because commentary was so boring i switched off but oh God what a miss😢😢😢
We need Stones and Debryune back so bad
That City second goal by Foden is exactly why I love City 💕💕❤❤
edersonnn 1 shoot 1 goal
🤣🤣
ref is just such a cheat

They actually changed when the refferee blew his whisle in this upload, in reality it was about 1-2 seconds later
Thanks for amazing matched
So haaland is not a priority
Why is he wearing gay armband if its not the gay month?
spurs defendnya lawak dah
3:44 doku being good
Никогда не видел судейства хуже, чем в этой игре

What wrong with referee
Horrible defense from both sides  Ederson could have prevented 2 out the 3 Spurs goals. Emerson and Davies are always lost and didnt know their positioning. Yves was holding onto the ball for too long  City was not clinical in their finishing but otherwise it was a very great and entertaining game.
Simon Hooper victims after Liverpool v Spurs... LOL
Commentary was already Like 2 -1 before halaand missed the bottom corner😂😂😂
haaland losing confidence after his miss is just sad to see
Come on city next clash with Aston vila
Where is the minute? No minute on the screen. Is that the game was continued after being stopped?
Every week for refeere
Simon Hooper robbed us the winning goal scoring opportunity on a broad daylight.
CITY OEOEOE
Ange ball 😯
People make mistakes.. The ref made a mistake no question about that.. Haaland made a mistake by missing an open goal but isnt being crucified like the ref. Think overall the ref had a good game. Move on i say
I had such schadenfreude over the late call. Couldn't have happened to a more deserving team. It was especially poetic that the call was for a foul on Haaland which he screamed for when he usually just does that for his dives.
If this was boxing, I would have asked for a rematch. What a scintillating performance from both teams.😂 😂😂
Spurs is a different team now. They play really good football
Son and the city 🥺
Where is lloris?
So unlucky guys, keep fire
problem is our team is not balanced. Too many offensive player in the lineup make team vulnerable defensively...
Ok,there’s corruption in that league
6 points dropped in 3 just UNACCEPTABLE
Reeeeeedddddd❤❤❤❤❤
This is why i hate english league the ref or clearly rigging the games he signal the advantage and the stop it when he saw that jack was clean through 😂😂😂😂
The premier league is the best, but wtf for referees 🤬
Tottenham played well. But the last chance was not exactly
Player man city is monkey 🐒🐒🐒🐒🤣🤣
Always disappointment performance by premier leauge referees😢
We played better but the moment we hit the post twice i knew we were done hitting the post and missing opportunities always brings bad luck.. nevertheless our defense needs ro improve i cant believe we are conceding that much
I think there should be a penalty for referees if they commit mistakes of this magnitude.
Haaland dropping deep and making play is so wholesome 😢 liverpool fan tho
Fifa....
Simon Hooper reffed the Liverpool vs Spurts DEBACLE as well. This man is a closet Spurts supporter and should be charged with match fixing and banned from the PGMOL list of refs. SHOCKING decision, especially as he waved it to 'play on' before he saw Grealish bursting towards goal and then whistled to bring it back for a foul on Haaland!! WTF!!! TOTAL FIX!!!
Si botak
the ref got a call from the mafia, and they wanted a draw
Gotta blame on us conceded three goals not on the ref because we are better than other fans like gunners.
made sense for the ref to walk away with the game ball, thoroughly deserved, he won the match after all
3:32 Ruben Dias On fire 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Doku doesn't know yet. If Sonny runs next to me, there is no answer but to foul
Defense has been a huge problem this season.
haalland 2-1!!! ohhhhhh ehehheheh sit down
When Julian alveraz missed his shot I was so sad I'm a huge Julian Alveraz fan
Real Madrid always great⚽👑
city has 115 violations of financial fair play, they gotta be relegated....
Referee man of the match
Ederson is poor with his hands
always unlucky with spurs
Ya know, generative AI can be far more accurate and unbiased than human referee.  And it can make decisions in split second so there wouldn't even be VAR delay.
Son’s OG.. Haaland didn’t seems to touch the ball? He was given ‘assist’
What a ref 😂
Arsenal might have paid refree otherwise that was clear advantage..
멋진 경기였습니다. 토트넘 팬인 제가 봐도 심판 판정에는 문제가 있어 보입니다. 토트넘 홈에서 다시 봐요  맨체스터 시티!
The City should just buy Sonny....
藍月曼城，繼續加油⛽!!! 💙9👍💪✌️💙10
Very poor defence from spurs 😏
Can't forget Mahrez come back last year
Referee😢
man city must bring sonny in the team.
Sonny has a grudge against Man city??? Why is he so crazy??
I don't understand at all, the referee blew the whistle because of the advantage rule when City clearly in possession of the ball ? Like SERIOUSLY ? This was such a clear mistake made by the officials
근데 어차피 그릴리쉬 1:1 에서 못넣었을 거야.ㅋㅋㅋ
Crazy refere
Unfair to city , not a city fan
손흥민 골 없엇으면 맨시티는 졋다ㅋ 흥민선수 감사합니다 역시 맨시티 킬러가 맞긴 한가봄
I guess Son didn't want the game to be too easy, so he leveled it back himself.
What a Sonnnyyyyy
What a beautiful match both teams are damn good ❤
jesus most biased ref i have ever seen in my life
STILL BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD. ❤️
If the time is end the ref can blew anytime😢
Still criyng for 10 seconds when you have nighty minutes to win 😂😂😂😂
Son😊😊😊
We got robbed💔
Man I feel like if the defense keep this bad form going we have no chance at the champions league… BUT I BELIEVE, I really trust in this team, also Stones' absence probably led to even more problems
Hooper again Hooper again.. lol
Gracias por todo Diós
Foden goal build up and tactics is just mind bogling. all the opponents teams just made confused for the positioning
What a shame 😡 This refree is just too useless to officiate a PL thriller like that.. City were robbed 🥺
Best city 💙♥️
If Man City buried their clear cut chances, that last minute blunder by the ref wouldnt have mattered or happened. Man City deserved the 1 point
Ederson has nightmares everytime he faces Tottenham.. our defence is horrible this season. We need Stones back as soon as possible
when are we getting an inside city episode? it's been a while
No KDB, no party
The Ref ,needs to be Red carded
Julion Alvarez next Kevin de bruyne
City defense this season very poor 4 goals against Chelsea, 3 against Spurs if this continue they dont won any trophy
I've a feeling Watkins gonna hurts us Tmrw 😅
😂😂😂😂 caster angry haha

الله Hanya Dialah yang Maha Adil☝️
Kevin come back sooner, pls
This is probably the biggest blunder iv'e ever seen in the past couple of years. That ain't a good call ref, it just isn't.
