Frilled dragon? We call them frilled neck lizards in Australia and I've never heard them called anything else 🤷🏽‍♀️ 😂
لماذا هذا غير متوفر على قناتك العربية؟ هذه عنصرية يا رجال
Terrarai reference
That's a lizard😂
Bro the one you said Lego suddenly Lego app pop out of my screen
So guys it's based on the dilophosaurus but in Jurassic park the dilophosaurus had frills and spitted venom and dog sized but irl dilophosaurus was 20 feet long and had crests to intimidate and display for mates and didn't spit venom so this lizard is closer to the Jurassic park dilophosaurus but not the irl dilophosaurus

First of all, they are called Frill Necked Lizards, they are native to Australia.  Secondly, they are a protected species and are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity, meaning that it is likely that it has been poached from the wild for sale on the exotic pet market. SHAME ON YOU.

Too moods:  -Heckin Chill  -𝑯𝒆𝒄𝒌𝒊𝒏 𝑨𝒎𝒈𝒓𝒚
I don't reslly understand the price jokes. 800$ seems kinda chill compared to a dog at maybe 2000 or 3000 Even though they are smaller, they are living creatures. 800 seems very appropriate actually.

Pls name it cookie
This is so messed up. That a person can order a life online and have it shipped to their house then proceed to psychology mess with the creatures head so that it will display what is a defence response (the fanned frill and defensive stance) for the purpose of "entertainment" and views on the internet/potential monetary gain???!! Tf is wrong with people.

i like you pets its rili kjut
It kinda looks like Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park
Got a question how can you legally import animals like that into the United States? People would have to have a specialized license in order to keep them as pets because if they get out and escape into the wild, they can propagate and spread damaging ecosystems.
I can go outside and get on for free
There in Australia.🇦🇺
Good on you not to provoke the guy for clicks. Good pet owner 🎉
So how's Ur first look at my country's animals?🥺🥺😁😁

"No Wonder You're Extinct!" - Dennis Nedry
You are mean to your mother
Is that me or is that a dilophosauras
Cute :) like my doggy :D
ngl that look like a dilophosauraus
Try a mirror if you want to see the frill. Easiest way because then it will hopefully display it out of dominance/defence rather than fear.
Maybe include cost in your review 😂 the equipment, food and heat costs come in at a pretty chunky number per month too. I have a water dragon and she costs me a fortune. Love her but you really should mention that so people don’t end up out of there depth.
7:27 that thing is so comfortable instantly. It’s very common to get dragon which do not eat for weeks etc when being transported and rehomed
The problem with Walmart plants etc is you basically just introduced dirty potentially chemical filled plant and soil into sterile soil designed to be clean for the lizard. You basically added in parasites almost guaranteed
I think is to smal the aquarium
i like him
Cute❤❤❤❤❤😊
But if you pee in 😅it
Do the face reveal
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💩
Bro doesn't like legos??
Why would you put snake fangs on him in the still..? That’s confusing & stupid. They don’t have fangs.
So cute dragon 🐉 🦎❤️
Actually disgusting. You shouldn't be own exotic pets just to get views. These are living creatures that have needs and deserve respect. Let's home someone sticks you in a cage and walks you on a leash some day!
Crazy? I was crazy once
How tf did it breath in the box and sealed container with no holes to breathe from?
No way YouTube commented on this video

that looks like god from squirrel stapler
Its kinda cute
Even YouTube like your video
12:14 chill mother👍🏻
I can so you recommend it to me
It’s not a dinosaur, but it does look like a dinosaur because of the frill which inspired the Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park, but it’s a type of lizard lizards are not dinosaurs, even though they look similar they aren’t closely related dinosaurs are more closely related to crocodiles and birds then they are to lizards and snakes although they’re both reptiles they belong to very different branches that aren’t even related to each other
I never just throw the crickets on I feed them one by one because they will hide and be in there for a long time without being eaten
so..itiot bout a zard made a ton of money on views, just to get views, and now I wonder what happened to the (disgusting) lizard....not that I care, but still....jackass channel! all these sensacional titles are just a pathetic cry of desperation by these youtubers to get views...greedy folks!
It doesn't look cute
Bro used "The Voice" lol

Mama I'm handsome

If I was a pet I'd wanna be your bet bc most people throw some bark in an enclosure and a stick and call it a day ;-;
It’s my first ever time making videos but how long are you gonna make your videos for another year or so for 20 more years or one year old? I’m just saying I just want you to ask my question bye now

frilled lizards open their frills when stressed or scared in order to make them look more intimidating, also the black coloration when it arrived meant it was cold, pretty sure. also chickens are closer related to dinosaurs, buuut he did like you

You are a terrible pet owner. And the “previews” you show that never occur in the actual video is betraying to your audience’s trust. I’ll never sub to your channel.

Reptiles did not evolve from dinosaurs. This is completely false. The theory of evolution is a dogma without any scientific evidence. It was introduced not for scientific reasons but for ideological reasons. There are no fossils that prove evolution. More than 750 million animal fossils extracted from the earth prove that living things have not undergone any evolution. Living things did not appear by evolution but by the Cambrian explosion. And traces have been found that prove that people from the times when Darwinists claimed that people were half animals were fully human. And 200 million years ago there were people wearing shoes. "Triassic Shoe Sole Fossil" is proof of this. Darwinists hide this fossil from people, they never bring it up. There was no such thing as evolution. And countless studies in laboratories have failed to turn up any examples of beneficial mutations. Almighty Allah created living things not by evolution but by the Cambrian explosion. The functions of all organs, which Darwinists call obsolete organs in living things, have been revealed. In other words, there is no such thing as an expired organ in humans or other living things.
Almighty Allah has filled the earth with beautiful living things. Every living thing is proof of the existence of Almighty Allah. These living things could not have come into existence "by themselves" without a creator.  "There are proofs (of Allah's existence and power) for those who believe with certainty in your creation and in the creatures that Allah has spread (on earth)." (Holy Quran, 45/4)
Why get a distantly related lizard when you can get a real dinosaur? Chickens make pretty good pets...

To be fair they look like a dilphosaurus
It’s a dinosaur 😂
birds are scientifically dinosaurs so if you get a bird you have a pet dinosaur, birds evolved from dinosaurs but scientists only have a handfull of dinosaurs that they could have evolved from but they still dont know wich one yet.

Bros water bill1,00000,0000000,0000000dollars
I notice that many YouTube only for clicks many exotic animals buy. What do they do with the many animals? Some have made so many videos that they would have to have the whole house full. What happens next to the animals. Can he show his collection or are the animals simply thrown away like an old toy?
Wait u go to wallmart do u se chocolate mrbeast

Beautiful Mr. Jonathan Krystle Prehistoric IV
bro has a death wish 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
HOW RICH ARE U DUDE?!?!?!
Sheeeeeeeeeee
If you got chickens, you already have real, living dinosaurs around!
The fact that they only drink flowing water isn't entirely strange. In their natural habitat, stagnant water is likely full of microbes and parasites, and I imagine many animals naturally prefer flowing water as it is usually much cleaner.
Name it t-rex
I wonder how people can hate this guy he is soooo funny 😂😂😂❤❤❤i love watching his chanel
Bro, that is not cute. Imagine bite your finger.
What the heck is that thing? I know I’m weirdly seeing other dinosaurs but bro, I do not like that one bit.

He's a chill good boy! I think he already understood that you're friendly, and he seems quite intelligent. Also I'm glad that your mother appreciated the new member of the family so enthusiastically! Yeah it was expensive, but I'd probably do the same if I had enough money! 😂 It's nice to see that you avoid stressing him just for the views. Thanks! 👏

If you comment on my comment, but I’m telling you that you’re right it looks like a Dilophosaurus way back
"Looks like a dinosaur" No, the dinosaur looks like him. That was the one dino where they just let the artist go nuts. Thanks for reminding me how we'll never get a scientifically accurate and actually terrifying 18 foot dilophosaur in the Jurassic movies.
What a cute dinosaur
Bro bought a poison lizard from clash and thought we wouldn’t notice
The fact that there is also a dinosaur similar to that frilled dragon is crazy   Btw its the Dilophosaurus

Guys you do know that birds aren’t related to dinosaurs…. They ARE the dinosaurs
I’m like your biggest fan, but you are so stupid
It looks Ike the dilphosaurus
12:32 you would. I mean you already did😂

NO  MORE. WAIMART   FOR    YOU   KUZ
Real david attenborough cameo?😂
This guy sounds lile flamingo
Bro it doesn't look deadly it looks so cute I wish that was my pet.

so 𝓬𝓾𝓽𝓮 𝓵𝓲𝓴𝓮 𝓭𝓲𝓷𝓸𝓼𝓪𝓾𝓻
Dilophasaurs
I just like dinosaur their ever on on my profile
do you still have him
This lil Dino is surprisingly chill 🙏🏿
So they are basically mini version of lizard folk.
I wasted 13 minutes watching this.  This was terrible.
That's was my favorite lizard in childhood before i realize i have one
After watching this video, English has become my 2nd language…
If this mini dinosaur is reacting like this i cant even jmagine how a real wild dinosaur will react against humans
I did the same thing but with a midget I named him Larry, he's awesome!
ordered per mail — sick
is your mum single?
$800 ????!!! I can find them in my backyard
cant tell my homies i fw this,
Is ur mom single
Shoulda named him Dino, the Flintstone's pet dinosaur
8:37 what type of off brand David Attenborough thing is this bro 😂🙏
Is your frilled dragon poster still in stock
i can't imagine having money like this...even if you aren't rich...enough to be like "i'mma spend upwards of 2200+ dollars on a frilled dragon cus teehee youtube video"
Did you know Jurassic Park invented dinosaurs and Fortnite invented Spider-Man
What a weird dog
How much money was all of it together
Wait you can send animals through packages!???? That’s messed up..
I was scared when you took it out of the enclosure especially outside. I know they are fast. My bearded dragon can be extremely quick in the snap of your fingers.
him putting legos in enclosure where lizard can swallow it so cringe and obnoxious
Prä Bird afraid of Birds🤔😸
Maybe he willl find the black widow that You lost and will keep it as his pet...or maybe the other way around 😅🦖🕷️🕸️ Or maybe even 🧎🏻‍♂️🦖🕷️🕸️😸
I loved this baby dilophosaurus❤
Isn’t that the lizard from the movie Holes
I thought u got a triceratops as a pet
Bro didn't even show half of what was promised. I'm not subscribing
Did ya bake that branch in oven for a while to sanitize of parasites?
Dilophasaur?
This is chameleon 😂
In Indonesia that named "Soa payung" or Umbrella soa

That's Dilophosaurus
Bro it still looks cute right first of all you have to take care of a pet right dance club beats a lot of work right second of all you are going to be excited to have a new dog right third of all you should know how to take care of a pet dog fourth of all so that's all I got to say.😊
Bro if I was super I would be stupid because I do not know how to take care of that whatever is called😅😅🫣 😅
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bro go to lows
8:59 okay I’ll subscribe that was all out even more than the habitat you built
fun fact when its mouth open that means its happy :D
Cool mom bro god bless her other moms would've flipped out, she was so chill and even gave him a ten, also knew he wasn't worth the 800 lol
I subscribe
"Mom can we buy terragreen?" "No we have terragreen at home" Him at home:
its so funny that you say he looks like a dinosaur (probably because of jurassic parks depiction of a dilophosaurus with the frills) when in real life dilophosaurs didnt even have frills, and as far as i am aware there isnt a single dinosaur with evidence of having a frilled neck
That's the dinosaur that killed Newman from Seinfeld.
This is scary, but to really get him to be your friend, hand feed him regularly and take things slow with handling, let him get used to your presence. I’ve heard
Practice your handwriting it’s horrendous. I have a five-year-old that writes more legibly.
Practice your handwriting it’s horrendous. I have a five-year-old that writes more legibly.
Hi
Bro hide your mom
I don’t know if it’s just me has anybody noticed that YouTube has been commenting on more and more videos? 👇
I kinda want one😭
This guy kinda sounds like spooder man
Dilophasaurus looking ah

Hope you share the earnings from this video with Sir David.
Lizards aren’t dinosaurs but birds are dinosaurs.
Man maybe he isn't as ferocious as I thought he's actually pretty chill right no-WHEEEE
Mr. Prehistoric is a great name!
The Frilled Lizard reminds me of the Dilophosaurus from Ark: Survival Evolved
Is that enclosure really enough? Seems really minimal
That thumbnail is cruel
I’m actually surprised he didn’t try to eat the chickens
They do not live in the forest. They are a desert Creatures
Was the foam safe or made of an arguing-couple-you're-visiting kinda toxic?
Can you set us the website
Absolute historical revisionism that Americans just randomly decided Frillneck Lizards are called "Frilled Dragons".
Really good video❤🎉
Irish 🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
You need to add some isopods too
Actually Walmart to get plants?
I got mine for 200
I wish yanks would stop stealing animals from other countries
Thumbs 👎 because of thumb nail basically
A Dinosaur-t of
It looks like a helotile
A frill necked lizard is a beautiful animal. We have a wealth of beautiful and deadly wildlife here in Australia.
In Indonesia not buy
Hi one question where do you store all your pets i mean you have a lot of them
Erm actually, its a frilled lizard
Your mom could definitely get it bro
Dilosaurus
the dilophilosaurus
Aren’t the chickens more related to dinosaurs than that lizard? Ha
U forgot another thing  Cost
Have you ever watched the movie, Holes
Hey YouTube, no one asked stfu
Damn TerraMom is a fox 🦊 😅
that looks like the thing that killed dennis
The rarest thing is Google counting on your video
“Sfep 1”
Sir you can’t use brown dirt
Born to woof forced to roar
Naw a rhino iguana or red eyed crocidile skink is more a dinosaur.
Mr prehistoric is just a chill guy, thought he would run off when you brought him outside cause juvenile lizards are pretty skittish and  thats what my green iguana did when I first got him. I had to chase him around the neighborhood with a net with the help of my neighbor (this was 7 years ago, now he's  just a lazy, big, fat, old iguana)
Bro, you got SO LUCKY he didnt jump off thay log when you brought him outside, those chickens surely would've mauled him too!!!! Wtf! Chickens love eating lizards!!
i don't think bro likes walmart 😭😭 2:55
LIAR, HERITIC
I knew EXACTLY what his voice would sound like when i click on video Nasally americans  😐
That animal looks like a dilophosaurus
Tawh a etuc lil ruasodin   I reversed the words  What a cute lil dinosaur
"Not even scared at all" while the guy was looking up at the sky checking for opps 10:47

Put a t rex in it
Dilindungi woi

Bros the reincarnated brother of the Dilophosaurus but doesnt spit 😂
Bro I have a name suggestion. What about rex?
If I had a dinosaur I would feel it my baby momma
also, purposefully stressing your new pet out is pretty shitty.
this video misrepresents what frilled dragons are. They are lizards not dinosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs.
Hello

You are so lucky😢

No way youtube is in the comments
The blurred part of it getting pets omg—

The frilled neck lizard isnt a dinosaur its a reptile, something thats closely related to dinosaurs are modern day birds
"im not gonna show the chickens to my dinosaur "  the chickens being the actual real dinosaurs
AWWWWWWW CUTE❤❤❤❤ DINO😊
seeing people outside the exotics community get exotic pets is so funny
The reason why nobody should get plants from front end retail and not a dedicated plant store is often times the soil is littered with gnat eggs or other pests that can cause complications over time.

My favorite YouTuber
Frilld dragons are cool
I’m not sure if this applies to this kind of animal, but I’ve noticed that smaller animals freeze when they’re scared. That means he may have been terrified when you took him out of the cage.
A mini dilo :D
Eahhheee. It's AI!! 4:49
Dennis nedry:ayo 🤬🤬🤬 Dilophosaurus: I got you 😂😂😂😂😂😂

It look like a walking dinosaurios
DONT JUDGE HIM about going to Walmart
can you do leopard gecko
Lil cutie
Other Frilled Lizards: Aggressive and hissy   Mr Prehistoric: Chill and quiet
If I were to spend $800 on a pet, I would make naming it a high priority.
I got a bearded dragon, not the same but mine is such a dummy, but i love my pookie
I’m a big fan! I love how you don’t know anything about these animals you are buying, and then you reasearch!
Bet
I love lizards oh and it is not a dragon with a dinosaur. It’s just a lizard.❤❤😅😊
The poor tree was screaming😢
why is the terrarium so tall? these things like to run
Do you still have it

Dinosaw roar!!!!!!!😂
Dinosaw😂
The chickens found theyr ancestor
I Loved  watching this video of your pet Dragon; so entertaining &  informative. You have a real talent for storytelling.
Dianusarus
Off-brand Dilophosaurus
2:25 my bearded dragon does that too
all of the pets I find are expensive but cheap ones are ones I dont  like but ones I like are sold out by the way are you in austrailia because I am.
Frilled Lizards are actually extremely chill. And you can tame them really easily and you have to establish trust with them.
Ok
Yo what happened to the quality?
Hold him
Um what the sigma 😑
If it’s an actual dinosaur, you should have planted a Lepidodendron Tree
What kind of accent is that?
Great video my guy. Always wondered if they are similar in temperament to bearded dragons and surprisingly, they are! I will say that you should never take exotic species outside without containment or restraints. That's a big no-no. Florida is a perfect example of the many reasons why non-native species shouldn't be given the opportunity to escape into the wild.
It looks like a dephosarus from Jurassic Park
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂 dinosaurs aunt real😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

How do u take care of all your animals
Its a Frill Necked Lizard! There's Bearded Dragons, no such thing as a Frilled Dragon.  Why keep one as a pet? Americans!
face reveal?
That looks like one of the dinosaurs from Jurassic park
What’s the website called?
ITS A BIRD ITS A PLANE NO CELL BRAIN FLYING???
ITS A DILOPHOSAURUS???
Hi I would love to know if the frilled dragon plush is out of stock?
Why buy? Go to jungle and get yourself one.
FRILLED NECK LIZARD. And in the desert of Australia!
12:31 me too
Fun fact: A frilled lizard, or a dinosaur, is actually still worth less than some breeds of cats and dogs even at $800. Some pets can go over $1,000 and then some. Shibas are worth between $1,500 and $3,500, while a Spynx cat is worth between $1,900 to $2,500.
Bro really used eleven labs for the documentary (I love Eleveb Labs)
Who is going to buy a dinosaur like if you’re going to buy a dinosaur subscribe if you’re going to buy a killer fish
Bro made the smallest enclosure possible.
The dinosaur is so aggressive at 0:6
Because you can’t walk a fish
Dinosaur
Good job
6 months 😊
gunu keep it real buying exotic animals and keeping the as pets for videos / clout is.... kind of scummy ngl
YouTube dad is not a dinosaur
i like      🦕/🦎
*When Youtube responds, someone from that team definitely has a pet dinosaur at home or in their office.*
dilophosaurus is still exist
The fact that the chickens you showed it to are closer to a dinosaur than the thing that looks like one

Mr prehistoric is a chill guy 👍👍

Of course it's the dinosaur because having a dinosaur as a pet is absolutely amazing to have one.
The dinosaurs so aggressive at 00:6
It’s a shame you can’t go to Home Depot and buy the plant’s
You have summoned me now I take ur Dino
I thought frilled dragons needed a longer tank ? 🤔 butt good job
I bought one for one thousand dollars, but it’s for the light the cage and also the Lizzerd was only $400
I love frilled dragons

You do keep the animals after the video.. right? Just thinking like you only get them for video purposes, but made me think 😂
Dilophosaurus
when you took him outside, that was called regulating his temperature. he got hot so he let the heat escape
His mom is hot

Mr. Dino👌
Pine is toxic to reptiles, I’m not sure what kind of pine that branch is but I’m very concerned it was in there for any period of time.
Sigma dinasaur , doesn't care of anything,  just chill ..
Dino is my pet dog. And I have 4 pet dogs and one past away like 2 month ago Dino past away and Ella, Sasha, and Givy
that thing looks like it goes “rawr” like it *is* a dinosaur
8:35 That was awesome for me! 😂
cool
Can we take a moment to appreciate the dilophosaurus from JP 1993, the idea we're getting hybrids and whatever when in reality the dilo was the first clear mutation and hybrid
Dino
Hi, my name is a Lorne Ariya II literally love, love, love love love love Walmart, Walmart I am❤
you need to be careful taking him outside, reptiles see things differently in natural an artificial lighting. he may not recognize you at first an bolt. this is how some people get bit by there snakes when they take them outside for the first time.
Its a dilophosaurus
Name him dino
So cute
You should have named him Dilophosaurus

If you are scared to handle it you probably shouldn't have gotten it for a pet just saying It's going to live for quite a while
T😂

Why did bro go to Walmart for plants 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good thing you are not Dennis Nedry! That thing is practically a Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park!

Its called a FRILLED NECK LIZARD there from Oz 🇦🇺
Dinosaur obviously

Thank you for posting! I need advice: My Crypto Wallet holds some TRX 20 USDT, and I have the  seedphrase: -clean- -party- -soccer- -advance- -audit- -clean- -evil- -finish -tonight- -involve- -whip- -action-. How to go about sending them to Kraken?
Устал он просто
Bro this thing looks like dilophosaurus☠️
I sub for you
I.  Love it too much love
We have 1 thing in common........ We love Walmart 😂😂😂😂
WE'VE GOT PET DINOSOURS BEFORE 2050 💀
The big plant you bought in Malay is called Lidah Jin or in English,Satan's tounge
Image he GOT SCAMMED FOR 800’000 dollars
Why don’t you just  adopt a bird birds are basiclly Dinosaurs
You could have done a Holes themed name (because it kinda looks like the yellow spotted lizards) like Yelnats, Zero, or Mr. Sir, but Mr. Prehistoric is pretty good too
The good dinosaur
I watch ur vids everyday
I am learning this animal in school
The hell did you buy crickets later on in the video that's kind of scary
I i think it's super cute even though it looks like a dinosaur
Youtube just commented what a cute dinosaur
Hey tera green youtube just commented  you yeah i'm just so excited because youtube did it by the way i like your videos i love it very much
Bata comment is gay and pen is gay also
I just get that dragon NI you can just get it and wild that's a waste of money 800
You should get a bearded dragon as well
If you do actually wanna get one of those, it would probably be a better idea to get a bearded dragon, cause it’s basically the exact same thing just way less aggressive
One day, you should actually buy a pet dinosaur one that looks like a dinosaur not a real one cause dinosaurs are excellent
looks like a danger Dinosaur ❌ looks like a pookie✔
Taking an animal outside that your too afraid to pick up isn’t a great idea
I was in Kings Canyon Australia and I encountered this guy. It was chill till I got close to it. Then it rested up and flared out its collar. Whoa! Boy! So sorry I just wanted to say hi!  I left it alone to soak up the sun!! Feisty  dude
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
12:27 what about Elon Musk?
chris Pratt gotta watch dis
Bro thinks hes the jurrassic park dilophosaurus😭🙏
FIND    something    constructive  you  can  do  with your  life
that  is a  wild  animal  belongs   in   it;s natural  setting in  the  dusty  bush..  Disgusting   to have  it  locked  up..  why  do you  think  money  can  buy  you  anything.   DISGUSTING.
You have chickens so you already had dinosaurs! The lizard is cool, though.

Dilophosaurus in real life:
his names should be frizzled
Bro make a dinosaur Habitat
I wouldn’t put him in your kitchen table. You wouldn’t want him to fall off and get hurt.
Maybe mr dilopho?
UwU
3:26 I have the same Lego set!

frilled neck lizard in the first vid bro, theyre native here in australia
bro is too chill
Why would you doubt you? They’re literally the best place ever Walmart
Выращенный в неволе, конечно он привык к людям и поэтому такой спокойный. Дикая ящерица бы уже давно взбесилась 😅
I haved a chameleon but He died 1 year ago😔😔😔🏫
Did you know that this was a type of dinosaur
How come you never showed your face
Csme for the dinosaur, subscribing for mom. God damn 🥵
How much y'all wanna bet he put those lego flowers back in the enclosure when the video ended
I love your merch I have 5 of the frilled dragon t shirts cause I love frilled dragons ❤
Bro casually wasted 50 dollars worth of legos
I have a bearded dragon irl
😊😊😊😊😊😊

إيغوانا هاديك تكفي
The lizard looks so cute
Bro unkle bitter as his pet☠️
Hey atleast he loves you, unlike other dinosaurs
Frillies will tame up like a bearded if you handle them regularly. If you want him to frill up show him a mirror.
VIVA Mr. Prehistóric
Yo, I’m doing the floor science project the exact same one you’re doing right now
does anyone remember the Jurassic Park  game with this dinosaur ....
Bro that looks like a fucking Pokémon
That’s a very unique pet of yours
Call him frillo
Just a heads up that foam you use off-gasses like crazy, essentially hot-boxing the poor lizard in whatever horrible elements cook off it. Would highly recommend reading up on how long it takes to safely off-gas the foam before putting something in a semi-enclosed space filled with it. Edit: Also, Walmart really doesn't have much selection. Go on google and look up a local nursery, you'll get much better selection including many plants that would have been native to the lizards area.
Is it only me who's more into his mom than his pets?😂man  she hot af😵🤘
I love lego
It's not a dinosaur
YouTube you’re weird
In Australia we call them frilled neck lizards
Your PET is SO cute ❤❤
lol bro got a dilophosaurus :D
I'm scared at chicken
You need UVA  and UVB lightrays
Got to judge the lizards friendliness, not yours. You taking off points cause you're afraid to touch the calm friendly lizard?
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww😍😍😍😍😍😍
You're a madman, I respect it.

Emphasis on kinda seeing how this is a frilled neck lizard, this is a reptile which is closely related to dinosaurs. Technically, anyone who has a pet bird. Has you beat if you have a lizard. Especially a chicken...

I've seen those when I was visiting my grandma in Florida during my childhood, and about 4 years ago when we were visiting to check out a condominium. I saw them in the distance as I was walking around. It always surprises me whenever their frills starts to pop out! 💀
“Get this trash out of here “should be a sound effect
That one part that said “for $800”made me laugh
I live in aus but never saw one befour
What the hell was What video you shode me

high quality dirt is the best thing Im gonna hear all year
He’s so chill that I won’t get mad at you for calling him a dinosaur in front of your actual dinosaurs

I love your new pet, but the funny thing is that your chickens are actually closer to being dinosaurs (they technically are). You seem like a great pet owner, I've subscribed.
I’m sorry bro but your mom could get it 🫦
w
name it goober
🥺
This is a fairly young specimen, they can get pretty big.
Mister Prehistoric, the chillest dinosaur
the fact you have chickens which are closer relatives to dinasaurs than a frilled dragon that you jokingly call a dinasaur is hilarious. Great job on that enclosure dude
Looks like a dragon
You should flip it sideways, upwards isn't enough space for them
Looks like a dragon..
you should have gotten wider terrarium
3:28 that looks like a scene in lego jurassic world

REAL YOUTUBE!?

You're the best bro. My mom. Let me subscribe to you. It's because she said that you're a good man and that you make good videos
You should get a animal for a pet and I know the perfect animal. It is called a II like it's not what the parrot I mean. It's not what the pirates say. It's actually a ayi. It's nocturnal😊
Hello, you are a great guy
Name him FRILLY
0:52 nah priem home😭
I can't tell, but the wood you used from your yard looks like pine. Pine is toxic to most reptiles. So is cedar. You should also be mindful of any pesticides used on trees and plants. It's best to bake wood in the oven at 200 F for half an hour before using it in reptile enclosures to ensure all paracites and bugs are killed. And if you want to use live plants in an enclosure, you should look into a bioactive set up. You'll be cleaning excrement regularly, if not.  Otherwise, this looks good. They should have more space, but it can be difficult, I think, to provide these guys with enough space in their enclosure. The best thing is to interact with them a lot so they can get exercise and enough enrichment.
Call it radar
poor animals... what you love you let go....
NAME HIM Junior
Just cause you are a baby does make him less friendly lol at least a 9 out of 10 friendliness

Hey do you know the message I gave you about? How is the leg to keep a Brumby as a pet? Australia wild horse? Well can you do it tomorrow please? Because I wonder how like to keep a bumpy as a pet because on the future I will actually keep a Brumby as a pet I made sure it enclosure is super big because Brumby like to run around and then big space so you big space The Brumby can run around and and be happy
Can you do a video of how is it like to keep a Brumby Australia wild horse as a pet please I’m your biggest fan
It's doesn't want humidity. You literally think it's a Boyd's Forrest dragon or something.  Fml
Your lack of knowledge is a worry. I can't believe you'd put that frill neck in such a terribly dangerous situation.
I love animals they are so cute 🥰☺️😊

The reason they always show that 99% versus one percent ratio for the statistics is because they actually valid truth if this guy has 9 million views on this video and he only has 400,000 then there is a pretty big chance that a lot of people subscribe in comparison to millions of people
bros foreshadowing is 50% of the Video
Thats a Dilophosaurus! 🦖 💀

MAKE THE DINOSAUR OPEN IT'S EARS
I love how the Frilled Dragon looks like they are constantly doing the pogging face.

Yoo my uncle lived in Brooklyn in the early 80’s and it was a terrible apartment with roaches everywhere and his room mate had a chameleon and it got loose. He said the roach problem slowly went away and but one in a while you would see a weird looking brick above the stove “his favorite hunting spot” and it was huge! So they decided to leave him be.
BRO FRICKIN GOT YOUTUBE TO COMMENT!!!!

My pet dog bandit bites he's a African cattle dog
DILOPHOSAURUS

Cute ahh dino🤩🤩
The dinosaurs never really went extinct! There was one right there!!!!!!!!!!
He's cute and cool looking and he looks like a fictional dinosaur from Jurassic Park.  But he's not a real dinosaur.  Ironic that you do have some actual pet dinosaurs there. They just look rather different.
silly
I respect your opinion on Walmart having great plants 🪴.
Ohh what a cute lil dinosaurs❤
9:43 one question . Why did you make him a jungle biome?
Aww
You can buy a dinosaur!??!?!!? Just that easy
It’s adorable ❤😂🎉
The reason why it looks scary is because it’s trying to climb on your leg because you’re thinks your leg is a tree
Bro didn’t get a Dinosaur he got a dragon
This lil guy is not a dinosur It’s technically a dragon😅
That is a literal dolophosaures - U -
It’s so cute 🥰
ɐɹ ʎon sʎıɹıs
3:19 I have that same set, and it’s unironically used as decor.
@youtube

They do not live in forests they live the outback
Is it poisonous
As a dinosaur i can confirm i look very deadly
I like dinosaurs 2. My fantasy dream is riding a wooly mammoth or a teradactyl. Maybe hanging out with a saber tooth 😊 I felt sorry for the brontosauris in jurrasic park that caught the virus 😢
Is that youtube
holy lemon lizard
I wonder how much it cost all fourniture+car+animal ?
Thats the poison lizard from clash of clans
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 Ffgcfgv
No you didn’t buy a dinosaur, you bought a demon!!you should also do a shoutout to Walmart for providing you with these things!!!!!i ❤ Walmart for my craft stuff and my cloths!!!
Yup, considering that the frill is a threat display I think you have a pretty chill and happy (if damn expensive) lizard.
Name it sam the friendly lizard
2:55 bro did them dirty with the sub count 💀💀💀

How do you have chickens?
I almost had a heart attack when you said heat  if you search up heat you'll see why I almost had a heart attack😂
That is actually a walking fish, dinosaurs are mainly giant wingless birds, i liked the fish btw, pretty dinosaury
Bro got a Dinasor 😂
I feel like lizards 🦎 have to be slightly aggressive because of how delicate they truly are
Like a what?
Nice dog
Awesome dinosaur
Is your Mom Single ?

2:47 is this ad for Walmart?

I love videos like this
that looks like it’s gonna attack you but when it goes for you, it’s actually just a type of lizard just climbs eyes finger disease yeah that’s pretty much loving. Trying to climb you.
You need a face reaval

About 600 bucks for set up cost
My mom has 2000$
Bro buyed and wasted lego plants 😂 (maybe a lego giveaway. Anyone agree?)
I thought that was very deadly turns out it could be a  good pet friend 😂❤😊
3:15  "I don't need it...i don't need it...i DEFINETLY don't need...I NEED IIIIIIIIIIIIT! * Buys a set of LEGO flowers *"

Cute dinasour😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro went to Walmart 🤑🐲
9:28 chihuahua has left the chat

If you do not know the name of the dinosaur it is a dilophosaurus
You’re a good man😊

A thrill dragon lives in Australia. And part of you is guys only cut up the frill when they're angry scared or from hunters, try the hunter, but birds aren't their hunters the day eat milk to eat mill, worms and quick.  But they also eat alert in sex, the frill dragon your pet dinosaur sword. This animal is a sleeved dark side of the hearts, but plants on your knee like a tree because they think you're a tree. That's why the videos and terrifying and they taste chase chase chase you d In by the way, okay, get one added a while. Out of the wild, please put it back out in the wild and set free. And I love watching animals get set out. So hosam.🦎🦖

Wtf since when did a frilled go for $800?
Just go to Queensland. I have seven in my yard
Me while being a dino 9:52
Is that the Lego sound
That's probably more like how dinos like T-rex did run. Bouncing on its massive hips and the long tail as a support.
You sound like TDBricks ngl
Name him Jerry. He looks like a Jerry.
It's funny how actual dinossaurs appeared on this video
Ur mom can get it 😫
😂😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊
He just legit has no enemies
If you don’t, you could risk your thrill dragon getting an infection
You should bake the stick in the oven
Take good care of it,❤ you get a new sub 👍
how can you not shake the cricket bag
OOoOOh got me lacking
If anyone’s wandering what animal he’s talking about it’s a dilophosaur
I have been begging my parents so much and I’m finally going to get one
Are u in the dinosaur age?
My dumb @ss thought it was a yellow spotted lizard from holes

Wow it looks cool
Helloooo Newman

HI
That’s a weird lookin’ frog

Umm actually dogs bite
How much money do you have 🤔

It doesn't look like a dinosaur, the frill of the dilophosaurus in jurassic park was entirely fictional. It was based off of this lizard species
…..?
Its kinda like a bearded dragon
OHH Bro thinks he is in BTS😂
Me building a home for snails when I was 8 . lol
You got YouTube to comment on your vid.
👹
I love your videos. I’m your biggest fan.

I am a lizard lover
Wow
It's the zoo shit
Its the cutest dinosaur I have ever seen
*spits venom*-
Cute lil diliphasuarus
if i was the owner of one frilled dragon i will call it drako or rex fun fact:you know that the dilophosaurus of jurassic park has the adn of a frilled dragon, by that it has a frilled neck, not like his real life mezoic contrapart
Bro costs the same as an PS5 pro
Lol my crested gecko got more attitude 😂
pls make the video longer
the Frilled Lizard think we are trees it like trees
I love your videos
I love your videos
Bro its called a frilled-neck lizard
Why you gotta lot of growing up to do? But that's the problem with America, is you're trying to do things that you have no f****** clue of you. Give up and then the animal suffers. But that doesn't surprise me much since most of you are all okay.With the government releasing pedophiles and violent sex offenders back into your own neighborhood
It looks like a dilophosaurus
the  better pet is youre dog even if he pased away youre real pet is inside of youre heart
bro thats not a dinosaur thats a frill dragon
when he makes that noise hes kinda like my cat
Wow that's so cute ❤
I love that you were nice to him love the videos and good job on the tank and he didn’t go through much stress and I love how he walks on his feet it the new lizard in town

Reptile fogger for humidity control NOT water sprayers! Use water sprayers periodically cause the dragon will enjoy it, but, too much and you can introduce mildew and mold into the enclosure.
What’s the website??
My mom said that if this comment get 10k likes i can get one
Bro commenter said Toyota!!!

Birds are dinosaurs. This is just a frilled  lizard.
Where yaaa momsssss at ? 😂
You better check those branches cuz they might have mites and stuff that could harm of not kill your animal
❤Your Mom is lovely!😊
we don't have any evidence of dinosaurs with structures like these afaik. Additionally, birds are dinosaurs, not modern lizards
It just looks so friendly all the time
Why is his mom built like a yknow 🟧⬛
Nice bait and switch with not stressing that dude out 👍 frills cool but not for his mood 😂
If you’re kinky you can let it slap you on the cheeks
Ooooooo cute ❤
Can I please have that pet
I like the Walmart.
I’d LOVE to have one of those unfortunately I value eating and I don’t want to avoid THAT for at that price for me would be around 2 to 3 months estimated.  Yeah I’ll stick with eating lol and true.
Very cool, nice work on the enclosure 👍
*new comfort Youtuber found*
bro got sealed packed like it was a food XD
Hope you’re not planning on keeping it in that enclosure for very long, given they grow to nearly 1m (3feet) long, and need to have plenty of room to explore and climb.
old man sounds like a south park voice lol
What do you do with your other pets
Dude you are hilarious 😂
Imagine being shipped for one week like this. Should not be possible to order animals like this
it,s Not like a dinosaur thrilled Dragon exe and sheh is so cute 😀
They get meaner older they get like bearded dragons n Chinese water dragon's
6:20 is when he finished the home

We need an update on Franklin 👽
Dilophosaur at home💀💀💀
bro used a knife to cut a branch💀
When is grave sounds funny😂😂 but just look cute😊

If you want something like this but you're on a budget just get a Bearded Dragon its way cheaper i have had a couple and they are damn near the same 🤷
That lizard was literally looking at you like why are you wearing gloves. 😂
A tip for you buddy when picking the Dinosaur up go under the chin they don't feel threatened it's the same with bearded dragon's
Skip to 7:00 to see the dinosaur.
What??!! You  can reatly can by PS 5!!
I think dino suit him! ❤
Yo the background looking like the bottom ground
The only time they will fill out like that is when they feel threatened or if they feel scared I thought I should tell you that
Bro turn into a BBC channel 💀 8:36
can't tell if this guy is a bostonian or not
Yo finally some one gets some thing from Australia!😂🇦🇺
Should his aquarium be a lot wider than tall

Dinosaur
WaT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉
You should get a bird like a parrot or a budgie. Like if you agree 😁😁😁
I'm a big fan and I think it would be really cool If you get a pet snail
Using a kitchen knife to cut a branch is something only serial killers and psycopaths do - it is the craziest thing I’ve seen so far in 2024😂
I want one ❤
That is so cute I have one called Izzy
It’s actually rlly cute 🥹🥹
Friggen clickbait

my man really cut wood with a knife
pet dinosaur are ceti 🦖🦕🐉❤🛏🚪jos keep the  dinosaus
Dang bro, you were brave to bring him outside.  If he or any lizard of that size wanted to get away from you, he’d be gone! Zipped off and up a tree lol.. 800 bucks done escaped up a tree never to be seen again lol.. We got those invasive red headed Agamas here in Florida and those things, for as big as they are, can climb right up a brick wall no problem.  I know this because they hang out on the side of this Applebees I go to.. Its so funny watching them scurry up and down the wall with ease.  dang lizard the size of a nerf football walking up and down the walls lol.
Why don’t you breed them
Pls😢
For a rare animal, they have quite the wild population 😂😂😂
Terragreen more like TTD bricks lol
It ain’t dangerous (except when he’s feeling threatened)
Oh my god oh my god it's YouTube they Type in
Cute and a little bit funny 😅
Get a African side neck turtle
Get a pet wolf spider
Frilled lizards descend from a raptor like dinosaur that spit acid
I've been looking for an Australian, and I had an Indonesian. They are great pets and can create a very strong bond with the owner.
I'm curious, what are you doing with all these pets after the video's? Do you keep them in your home till you eventually  have a whole zoo in your house? The care for all these fellas must be insane
The dinosaur it’s copying is a dilophosaur. In case u don’t know:)
i have come to an realization that the people that are using the youtube accounts love animals... a lot.
There's a cheaper way to get your dirt.
O *glitchs* H_H *glitchs* M *glitch* Y Y PS *crash* EE_ ! __! *blue screen*
people who knows that this is a real dino a lot of years ago
-Cool-
Dude that’s a fuckin dilophasaur
5:37 "Water to drink from" ITS LITERALLY TAKING A SHOWER

Nice cat there❤

What an asshole to your mom, “thats a stupid name”   Fuck your subscribe, block instead.
Check Engine 😅
😊 how much does David Attenborough cost for a chime in
Business is booming.
how old are your mom ;D
How do u not have basic tools like a saw. I mean its kinda australian cause its a" knoife" but get urself to the australian home depot and grab some tools so ur not cutting branches with steak knives
You should do a mantis shirmp
Those chickens will fuck that lizard up man. Lol and why did you put him on your kitchen table don't that carry salmonella?
My God
Bro, got YouTube to comment on his video
Ayyy sweet I had a client tell me about that site and couldn't remember the name of it just that it had morph in it. Was looking for geckos but might have to look into these guys🤔
Hey man! You probably won’t do this but I feel like some people including me would like it. When you do a simulation video could you not show what animals or other things that you’re gonna put in, in the intro. Because I feel like it ruins the excitement of the surprise on what you put in the tank.
A dinosaur
this things looks like a bearded dragon but the one that never shave his beard
This is such a cool little guy! Prehistoric is pretty sweet!
He's so handsome I hope we get to see more of this lil guy
My buddy had a life he didn't deserve that😂 8:26
Mrbeast has more subs then YouTube?
YOUTUBE???😮

It's not a frilled dragon it's a frilled neck lizard
Bros mom's a milf😂
I had keeping a dinosaur too he is a male hydrosaurus celebensis!😄
You should make a house
Dinosaur!
Hi YouTube I got that pet
that lizard looks like dilposaures
Is this McCartney Stan? Bro used to be my favorite Minecraft youtuber. Def subbing!
note to self never ask your mom to name your pet  lol
Face reveal????
Hi
How is it a dinosaur? It looks just like any other lizard, except for the frill, which the dinosaur in a movie you're basing that on, didn't have.
How much in total did this all cost?
Anyone who played Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, they are very interesting.
Don’t let it spit in your face we saw Jurassic Park
... Have i gone crazy or is that just a normal dog?
whats his name
YOUTUBE ?!
Bro has the honor of YouTube's official channel commenting on his video and he doesn't pin it. Damn......
Titanus Doug irl
😲 what a horrible way to ship a live animal!
Having a parrot is closer to having a pet dinosaur than a lizard
6:40 It's funny because the chickens are the real dinosaurs here.
Ji
O
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
He looks like a dilophosaurus :D
Fanto remade by me: hi@sssssssssssssssss
Why does the shower look like someone peeing🤨
Bro, you ordered dinosaur now
Make more videos about him please
You have an awesome sense of humour
You now what you are even better than I thought I thought that the lizard won’t like you but it turns out that he loves you 🦎
Name him Dino nugget
Nobody said anything about hiring David Attenborough 😂
Godzilla erm💀
Cute
Oh I know this animal

Good lord that thing is tame as hell. Like ive never seen one of those so calm. Whoever raised it musta trained it to tolerate people really well cause its just giving 0% of a crap about you moving around next to it.
He just said build it at home how do you build a dinosaur!!!!
When will you post your next video?
2:49 check engine on toyota is crazy
I seen one of these in arkansas I don't think anyone would believe me
Depending on the type you should change the ucb every 1 year to six months

Bro has the chillest mom
Hi 😊🤗
Looks. Like a yellow spotted lizard
My dad can afford it but he won’t give me it😢
Huzaaah

Pet didn’t update his game yet
This dude was the reason Jurassic Park got destroyed 😂
Mr. Pringle
Fuck Walmart
I thought these were known as basilisk and live in the desert of Australia?
the plant legos look like they beong on a mech
“And I washed it off to get off all the dirt “  *washing log on more dirt*
Is it poisonous? Looks like it could bite you in the nut sack
It only looks, or acts, like a dinosaur, if you know NOTHING about dinosaurs.  I really wish people would just STOP saying something is a dinosaur, or dinosaur-like, just because it is reptilian. The frilled dragon is nothing like a dinosaur. It's a LIZARD. Plus, those frills; Dilophosaurus didn't have them, even if Jurassic Park Dilos did. (Not to mention that Dilophosaurus was MUCH bigger.)   Dinosaurs WERE NOT lizards. NOT even close. They are Archosaurs. WAY different branch of "Reptile" lineage. If anything, birds are dinosaur-like, because they ARE dinosaurs. Crocodilians are closer to dinosaurs than lizards, and even crocs are a completely DIFFERENT Archosaurian lineage.   Lizards, like the frilled dragon, look and act like LIZARDS. Not dinosaurs.
The dinosaur is so cute! :D
You're the goat dude like literally
Looks Like DIlophosaur
you sound like flamingo
Misleading promotion. I'm out !
Your the goat daddy😊
Walmart is tha best

Very nice dinosaur (he is not fussy <3)

Frilled neck lizards are the most adorable creatures. They’re crazy as hell though and are surprisingly scary when they’re chasing you!
Is your mom a model? Cool lizard
4:06 MINECRAFT

Fun fact: If you want a pet dinosaur, get a bird as birds are actually Theropods which is a group of Dinosaurs so really how good a pet dinosaur is very variable.
Jeyden 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🦖🐕‍🦺🦌🦮🐓

everyone: "awwee thats sooo adorable" meanwhile me : is it just me who's getting the "baby in yellow" vibes from this lizard💀💀
Hello, I come from France and I notice that the prices of frilled lizards are absurd compared to our country 😱 If I can give you a piece of advice, watch the claws carefully because they are quite gruff lizards and they often break their claws. I have already had two, and both died of sepsis due to a broken claw...
youtube😨😨???!!!
10/10
Chickens are already pet dinosaurs

Coc players be like: Poison Lizard 😂
youbtube

Can’t wait for the enclosure to overflow with water
You want a dinosaur? Get a bird! 😃  True reptiles are cool too, though ✌🏼️
I was scared even from a robot of it

0:04 Excuse me sir but what do you mean it looks like a dinosaur? It doesn't look like any existing dinosaur!
These are not pets ‼️. They belong free in their natural habitat.  Humans kidnap and enslave other sentient beings and it's disgusting and reprehensible 😡
_Lol_
PIN ME
Him: It looks like a dinosaur  Crocodile: 💀
Awww... a baby dinosaur! So cool 😎
Hey i recognize that narrator's voice

Salla
Its more cheap than my dog I can buy 3 or 4 of them for my dog...
meeee it looks cute 😊😊😊❤ i ❤ pets😊😊
This environment does not reflect the habit of the Australian frilled-neck lizard. They don't live in Forests.. How is it possible to not know this? They live in dry semi-desert, savanna woodlands & hot dry grasslands of northern Australia... and they don't look like any known dinosaur. the ridiculous Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park was miniaturised and had a frill added purely for "entertainment purposes"... also they want space and width in an enclosure, as well as height...    euhhhhh
Is it deadly?
Bro I just subscribed to I appreciate your content
Hi😊
Dude, try making an enclosure for a Jellyfish
I like a pet dinosaur ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Positives: Has cool frills Negatives: Never shows them off after it gets used to you if you treat it well...
From where to u get that glass enclosure
How about the comments decide to name it?
Next step: trying to get an actual dinosaur as a pet and raising an ostrich

Don’t act dumb , it’s sounds stupid
Just admit its a dinosaur 😭
Bros rich bc bro had 800k money
Such an adorable dino!🥰
You should put a forger in there
Awe, your mom is so adorable and supportive.
It looks so cute, a mini dinosaur!
These Lizards are also in Australia. They are desert creatures in Australia. The fact I have only ever seen these lizards when I visited the outback makes me feel a little weird about the whole ecosystem you made. Mind you I have no idea what type you got. Maybe there really are frilled lizards in forests???
I remember my dad said he was in a desert like place and from a distance he’d see one of these running at him thinking that my father was a tree. (My dad was terrified ;)
you just adopted a chill one
hey can u name him eko
Iove from india your from

That is so random😅
Omg YouTube😱😱

Frilled Dragons certainly do have attitude enough to scare a few predators off. They're some of the coolest lizards out there.
Why do you keep calling it a Dinosaur
It’s relly cute ❤❤❤❤❤
I love your videos and God bless you 😊😊😊

W  mom Xd
I grew up in Darwin Australia, these are called Frilled Neck Lizards or Frillies for short.  I remember digging up witchity grubs from Nana's compost bin and feeding them.  They can move fast and are a great sight to see in nature, especially when they feel threatened and show their frills
Its delivered in a box?!
Whats the font in thumbnail?
the big plant is the onion plant
No way it looks like Aknosom from monster hunter
6:40 CHICKEEENNNNNNN

{   • △ •   }
Birds are the only extant dinosaurs.
Ark be like:
4:32 *hoses wood to take off  dirt while it’s on the dirt*
The dino losing point in friendliness because you were too scared of him is not fair. If anything, you should lose points not him.
i have a fear of moss... for some reason.
How did you do the David Attenborough impression? It's so good!
Kinda looks like a type of dinosaur that spit venom from Jurassic park lol
8:20 *insert Doom music*
“That’s a stupid name.” 😂 Yes!
…
These do NOT make good pets please do not try to get one they are high maintenance and the vet bills go up into the thousands of dollars. Most important they suffer in captivity.
who knows what the owner on the ad did to the poor lizard
A little cute dilophosaurus
All the dinosour was vanish in this world,itslizard
Dogs do bite you especially if they dont consider you their friend or family. You should know this dragon didnt know you yet
If at least around 25%. Of the people that watch this vid he'll reach st least 1mil
cool bro
6:37 the chicken  wanted to see there predecessor  because chicken  are the closet thing we have to t rex and so when you rat a fried chicken  you are eating a t rex
Yo tiny bit of editing criticism, the "coming later in the video!!" Sections can be a tiny bit too frequent, it kind of ruins the pace of the video sometimes  Otherwise, very cool video :)))
why ur dawg have fins

What you found my cat!?
I don't know why but you said it looks most like a Dinosaur with it's Frill open, but I think you meant it looked most like a Hollywood Monster because theres no Evidence that any Dinosaurs had Frills.

Yo pause what did you say? 4:07
getting a bird wouldve been more accurate for the title lol
12:08 pretty stupid name
Take him on a walk
So not only is the frilled lizard not related to dinosaurs at best. It's a super distant cousin going back like thousands of generations, but you can't say that this acts like a dinosaur because since dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago, we have no idea how they behaved. The closest we can conceive is their modern descendants which would be just go to a pet shop and watch parakeets for a bit.
Mom:i wana name him prehistoric!  TerraGreen:Thats a stupid name.
Skaarl

Birds are dinosaurs
Must have been a good pet shop that hand fed him. One of the most chilled  out juvenile frilled lizards I've seen. All of your movement around him with the camera and he was just like "Meh."
Weird ass dog

Lizards arent dinosaurs, birds are.

Dinog is his name
It is a dillophasaurus
This one is a friendly looking dragon it's just climbing people leg in not do nothing😅😊😊
Omg a cute lil dino
buying exotic animals is just wrong
It’s called a frilled lizard not Dinosaur or dragon and it is located in deserts in Australia and you come across them quite alot
this vid is gonna become his new most popular vid
Kinda look like a dog?
I get that calling it a dino in the title, thumbnail, and intro is a clickbaity joke gimmick thing, but continuing to call the lepidosaur a dinosaur and using images of theropods when talking about a squamate throughout the video really got on my nerves. xP
Get an iguana so the Dino isn't lonly
I have fish dragon
Dilophosaurus 😮😮😮😮
Average Australian pet:
I think your adblue in your car is malfunctioning

You know its a awesome video if youtube comments
Make  a video that u buy a sugar glider
pro lil bro was in darkness for days
Where did you get it
Not gonna lie $800 is that not that much especially with all the terrarium stuff the cost of the lizard is a nonfactor it’s the cost of the terrarium and all the supplies you need for it $2000 for a lizard that comes to monitor lizards monitor lizards can be up to $2800-$6000 and the terrarium can be $10,000
You’ve grown so fast, been here since 100k lol
awww... Mr Prehistoric
You got YouTube to comment that's awesome
I'm sorry, but there isn't a single dinosaur species that doesn't look like this lizard.
Nice dinosaur
frilly
Naw that’s a yellow spotted lizard
You should do an a walking fish next video  😅
THE DRAGON IS BETTER
explanation of this:it has the look and sound of a dilophiosaurus when the dilophiosaurus notices its prey it will pull outs its frills as it creates acid or poison that gives pain and paralysis but the frilled dragon witch has not the same effect so the frilled dragon has to get close as the dilophiosaurus can shoot acid in the backround but the frilled dragon cant do that
Actually there was a dino back then that was a Raptor with frilled lizard head and it could spot acid out
Mom I want this pet at any cost
YouTube him self even fu***** comment you
Do you keep these pets?
Wow
cute
Why are they doing that I go to Walmart too

It looks like a dragon
Just want to remind you your video got YouTube itself to comment on it
Even though frill dragons are actually Australian
How does one have 500k subs and over 3 million viewers holy sh-
Your Dragon is cute😊
0.35 was funny😂😂😂
If you left the Lego flowers in there the pet would probably eat one of the pieces
You should also get a draco flying lizard.They are very cool.
I dare you to keep a live nautilus as a pet.
Bearded dragons make amazing first time pets and I feel are chilled out cousins of the frilled lizard. Depending how much you socialize and familiar yourself around them affects the relationship and handling. Of course this goes for any pet but all animals and reptiles have their weird quirks of their likes and dislikes.
It didn’t do the thing, not once the whole video
Green Dino or Gray Dino
Looks like toothless
It’s a dilophosaurus
I thought I was going to watch a video about a dinosaur and not a Ryan trahan video😂
Good job and IM YOUR 500k SUB i think??? BUT YEA I SUBBED AND U HIT 500k :)
And i have a bearded dragon. They are very friendly and friend sized.  Edit:i give him pats and kisses everyday. Hes very good boi material.

Ayooooooo! 4:32
How about we just call with Frank
Bro like 0:38 😱
There’s no frill cause it’s domesticated. Not from the wild.
You’re crazy. Why would you get a pet dinosaur
this video is… fantastical😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love it
They ship dinosaurs now???😂
No way

If you want an actual dinosaur (that is in the dinosauria class) just get any bird
Acts like a raptor 0:20
Can u simulate a mesa biome with cow killers?
This is not a very good thing to put in your videos. If anybody has common sense, they will know that this thing is not a dinosaur, and it does not act any way like a dinosaur would. You clearly do not have the intention to keep this lizard with you for a long term. You only bought it for a video that is not a very good thing, not trying to be annoying or a nerd. It is probably common sense to everybody watching this video that keeping a lizard, which is an animal and a living being, in your house just for a video is not a very good idea.
BUZZILA
There is a thing in Maryland where it’s called puppy spot which yeah I have to give more money maybe like 2000
Lizards aren't dinosaurs, if you want a pet dinosaur just get a bird

They’re a wonderful thing, I’ve always wanted one and probably will get one in the future. Also the more common name is the frilled neck lizard in Australia. Quite uncommon but occasionally there will be one crossing the road 😂
The name should be frilly or mrs frizzle
why the frilled dragon is so expensive is cost 1000 USA
name him (will)
I love that he has 12vid and he has 483k subs
He is a very good YouTube. He should deserve at least 1 million subscribers.

I don’t know
I had one of these little bastards !! It was vicious as hell and just plain mean !!
Isn't this set up for an Indonesian frilled dragon, as cool as the enclosure looks I believe humidity should be similar to a bearded dragon for the australian version
Bbboy
If you wanna get a more accurate representation of what owning a dinosaur would be like, get a bird . . . preferably an ostrich . . . or an emu . . . or a cassowary if you're feeling extra spicy  you might die tho
More videos pls I love your content 😂

Hahahahahbhhurddfihdgf
Fun fact:When The lizard uses its frill to scare off predators and display to other individuals and the Frilled dragons are docile creatures that aren't normally aggressive toward humans. However, these aren't the type of lizard that enjoy being handled. Frilled dragons can be high-strung, which means they aren't likely to sit in your lap for long periods of time.😅
Hi first
This is the closest thing we will ever have to a pet dinosaur

hey dummy you hearted a bot comment
I have an idea for a name, how about "Fossil"?
U got way too much money
Revelation 20:2-5 (KJV)  And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
So cool 😊
He looks alert and curious!

Try not to use anything miracle gro brand in the future, especially mixes with fertilizer balls like the one you used in your soil blend. They’ll inevitably ingest dirt when eating so it has to be chemical free
Your mom is a doll! I like Mr. prehistoric too lol

Can’t believe you got abroad in Japan to narrate

Maybe keep chunks of mice in your freezer and feed it that? If snakes can eat it I don’t see why this reptile cant
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

mr pherictoric (start in replys
It’s basically a Dilophosaurus except it doesn’t spit acids at you….it just has frails and sits there MENACINGLY
If you have a pet rooster, its pretty much the same (i say it from experience💀)
I never seen that for my life
blud bought a whole Dilophosaurus from jp😭🙏
WHY? WHY do people get wild animals as pets...he deserves his original home to thrive.  And I'm very apposed to any kind of cage...but get something MUCH bigger dude. And if you were my kid....I take you to have your head examined...spending ...what was $ 800...plus. Please take perfect care of him...your his family now...his little ancient dinosaur life is in your hands. Do you know how long they live in captivity?

Pee  Nooooooooooooooooooooo
Omg this was so informative and entertaining! I have to say that I simply clicked on it because I was bored and curious. I have 25 other reptiles and had no interest in a frilled.  Now I’m finding myself actually doing some research on them! Great job ❤
I have a bearded dragon it’s like a dinosaur
I love Mr. Prehistoric!!!

no dinosaurs actualy had frills. also you could just get a bird which is a dinosaur
Nice video, love everything about it!!!! ❤❤🇯🇲🇯🇲
I asked my mum to get one of these before I watched this, thank you.
💀💀What about you adopt a scariest bird in the world💀💀
Bruh that is so rare a lot of people don’t know this
I think you're getting the thought that it looks like a dinosaur from the (Jurassic Park where the Dilophosaurus has the frills on its neck) witch it did not have in real life, but i do believe that the   Frilled Dragon was the inspiration.
Why does it fortnite sounds
Even if it's legal, buying exotic animals is morally wrong. ❤
🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖
They’re actually super docile and similar to iguanas when you get them as babies and handle them. I want to get one but they are climbers & need to get a tall tank. New to the channel great video!
The closest Dino to that I can think of is the diloposauraus
the actual average is 8.666666666666667 (add the total numbers 9+7+10 = 26 then divide it by total numbers which is three 26 divided by 3= 8.666666666666667) but if we round it we get 8.7
Stop saying baby
His name should be stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitchstitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch, stitch😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Great video! I am about to have my own lizard too
Straight from the jurrassic park
thats looks like dilpho saurus maybe a desendent
Instead of buying it just go out side and get some dirt😂
Totally wrong within the first 20 seconds! Number 1 they aren't rare and Number 2 they are frilled neck lizards NOT dragons. They do not live in a forest either 😂 seriously you shouldn't own one when you don't know a thing about them.
It’s so cute in the video on the website
people when they see lizards: OMG A DINOSAUR!!!!!!!!! IT'S SO ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS people when they see actual modern dinosaurs: look at that stupid chicken
Over a million views in a day that’s insane
Yoo he got David Attenborough
if you wanted a pet Dinosaur then just get a bird
It’s basically a lvl 10 bearded dragon
Slap The dino
That's a whole ass lizard sitting on a rock. It's begging you to stop filming because it doesn't want all the attention it wants online.
I only knew about these thanks to playing the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series
Americans: we have the best content. Australians: we have dinosaurs 😂
The chickens you have makes me think of my chicken
Its like Dilophosaurus but tiny
Funny you call that lizard a dinosaur while you have actual dinosaurs in the yard.
He looks like a mini dilophosaurus hybird, xd. I think you should name him theriz (like theriznosaurus) because he walks like one. But want a REAL dinosaur? Get a bird.
Mudwalker
How do you have so much space in your house to keep all those animals 😮
Beautiful dinosaur, CALL HIM DILOPHOSAURUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Bro went to fedex on 6:25
Fun fact: chickens are the closest living relative to the T-Rex
I really want one but for me 800 bucks is roughly 2,900 cus the difference in money price
3:06 Man ur also a walmart plant (im just kidding) now pls give me my Pin daddy Said i deserve it
Can u face reveal pls?
C. O. O. L.
7:12 the way he tilted his neck: wait so am i a deanosawerrr RAWWRR

Bro did a side mission to his side mission
Bro revived the dino called “dilophosaurus” but that’s amazing tbh.😊
Niiice toyata
Whats his name?
he looks like a dilophosaurus
beautiful lizard. I'm somewhat of a beginner when it comes to reptile keeping but this is definitely an animal i would love to own one day.  I've also seen some people with frilled dragons use one of their hands and place it under the frills and push them up, that way you can see the beautiful dinosaur like feature without having to show them a photo of whatever that cursed emoji was 😂
F*** off actually, how do you lie?Turn right
Justin Bieber's has to be Jeff. Please Jack, please just Jeff jeff Jeff, please have Jeff jeff Jeff jeff Jeff gift really, really, really Jeff really rubbed me guff Jeff jeff Jeff jeff Jeff. Let's have a café friend.

"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:1-10)  ''Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.   (Ehpesians 6:13)

Quick question. Do you all synchronize your uploads? I feel like recently your uploads have all been on the same day or two day period. In any case, great stuff!
I have a bearded dragon so isn't that close enough to a dinosaur I mean he can run but he can't stand up on two legs yet..... He knows how to jump for food he knows how to sit and lay down He's still working on those tricks though
I need some fossils too of compsognathus dinosaurs❤😂🎉😢😮😅😮😢🎉😂❤
There's walking fish called mudfish😊 they're so cute but I would not like a dinosaur they would eat my cat and my dog

next time you do this you should make a drainage layer but thats just my opinion
Mom:Oh yeah ok cool pet 10/10 Him:ok bye
Get him really used to you!! That would be amazing to be able to freely handle him when he’s full grown. You’d have your own guard lizard.
*d i n o s a u r*
That ain't a dragon that's a whole ass diliphosaures
When the enclosure is the same size of the pet...
its a frilled neck lizard not dragon
Thats cute
You should check every so often how many crickets are in the enclosure because if there are to many they will try to eat your lizard while it sleeps
I like reptiles❤❤❤❤🎉
You could’ve found it for cheaper on a trustworthy website and at a younger age
Dino😊
Okay I m Filipino this monster eats baby's at a pregnant woman and the monster tunge got longer and get to the pregnant woman tummy and eat the baby or a adult the monster can eat you when you're sleeping at night this monster is a urban legend  When its morning the monster go back to his body and pretend to be a human at night  and cut his body to fly this have a wings to kill this monster first you need garlic and alcohol and salt and mix and into her body and dies so people so Filipinos didn't. Know  a manggagal can be a human and pretends so many Filipinos didn't know about it so many manggagal have spotted in Philippines make sure to be safe

Frilled lizards don’t actually attack humans, they only run after them and frill up just for intimation
nonono you have to take the crickets into a different space or they can hide!!!
They live in dry/desert areas so if you have one make sure you have a big cage and use sand and stuff(edit I just found out that some live in grassy areas 😅)
Git a otter

This thrilled dragon looks like a baby, adults are a lil bit fater and lighter in colour. Also if u gonna take it outside put it on a leash cos if it escapes and runs up a tree you'll never get it back as most lizards inculcating thrilled dragons can dash out of sight faster than you can say "BUZZ LOOK, AN ALIEN! And different l8zards have different personality so whilst ur one my be freindly an other one might want nothing but to bit ur finger of (but most will probably run away)
"It reached up to 100 degrees"

Have you ever watched the YouTube show,  "Clint's Reptiles "? He's a super cool, funny and smart. He's has a PhD in biology and a bunch of other letters behind his name. One of his favorite topics is "Does this ________Make a good pet?. He has a check list like yours. He tells you the 5 things an animal  must do to be considered a good pet. You should watch one of his shows. I think he did one on this cutie. How could you think that sweet thing was dangerous?... The only time they flair and run is when they are afraid.  He looks really sweet. Congratulations on hit new best baby and go watch one of Clint's shows.
:)🦖
You are so funny... and apparently rich too!🤑 $800 for your dinosaur and all of your decor is really spendy.. oh and let's not forget your $50 Lego flowers😅😅.  So tell me Mr, Dinosaur Owner... how old are you and..... are you single? I've have  ALWAYS wanted a Croc  monitor 🫠🥰
Please keep in mind that they grow to about 35 inches/90 cm long, so you're going to need to upgrade the size of his enclosure quite substantially as he grows. I'd recommend a minimum enclosure size of 48 inches long x 48 inches wide x 60 inches tall; although larger than this is preferred if you have the space available.
Bro do you not know that dinosaurs are real some dinosaurs survive the meteor
My mother hates Walmart😅😅😅😅😅😅😅

And you can compare prices from other breeders! I'm mostly a venomous snake keeper, but I love my pythons, boas and colubrids, too!

That cage is too small for him my guy
Bro got a whole ass dilophosaur😭🙏
Bros uniting all the prehistoric animals.
Dino
You should call him Snuffles.  He’s probably very chill around humans because he’s domesticated and use to humans.
I hate you I'll try and see those frills or whatever
Sorry 4 hours late.
i love this channel <3
Birds are also Dino’s
Nahhh he has a pet dilo
Bro you could grow them😂😂
That's the annoying little brother of the dilophosaur
thank you for not forcing him to show the neck frill for clout <3
The Australian frilled Dragon looks like a dolofasuaras
lizards arent dinosaurs if you had a chicken, an emu or another bird than you could call it a dinosaur (even without a kinda)
When do you build a home for the cow killer its august😭
Real life Jurassic park dilo
Bro dinosaurs don't act like that
Ark dilophosaurus
You earned another sub because BBC (not warmart)
Maybe you should do a lizard house when you put all the lizards in your container and then you put them in like a stack of lizards in like a house or a shed and then you could feed him in like you can put them in there and you can collect all the Elizabeth’s over by
cool video

Fun fact : The creature you called a dino isn’t a dinosaur, but chickens are.
It is actually not dangerous. It only does that to scare away, predators, if it realize you are not a predator it will walk away in the very funny way
lol if you actually kept the Lego flowers in the pen your pet would eat them.😂
If dilo were reincarnated 💀💀💀💀

8:49 bro got a voice over💀
Wow, lots of youtubers seem to not actually care about pets they buy and just get them for videos, but you actually seem to care about you made a really nice set up! Im so glad to see this! One thing I do recommend(as a lizard owner myself) is a thermostat so you don't accidentally fly the little guy, not many sources mention you need one but I found out its super important as my heat lamps temperature got quite high and with only a thermometer it was dangerous for my lizard! Good luck with the new family member!

Hi terra am early
I like nature 😊😊😊😊😊
2:55 the place you're idum tho😂😂😂
He lokey kinda cute
That is a desendent of a dilo
Fun fact: dinosaurs dont look like a lizard wit ha frill on it, nor do they act like one. the real dinosaurs are birds. Birds belong to the theropod group of dinosaurs that included T. rex. Theropods are all bipedal and some of them share more bird-like features than others. Archaeopteryx, discovered in 1861, was for a long time the only truly bird-like dinosaur – it's from the Late Jurassic era (150 million years ago). To spice it up when you get a REAL dinosaur, try to get a ratite like a cassowary or Emu. sure it doesn't look like a dinosaur, but it is a dinosaur.
ONE HOUR AGO  pls pin me I aubbed
Aussie lizard, nice mate

Okay, but I want to see the mud  skipper

The chickens are the dinosaurs, not the frilled dragon. Also,no dinosaur has a frill.
Wow very cool Dilophosaurus🥹
Bro went from fish tanks to A WHOLE DINOSAURR  You should do more reptile videos btw
Hi
I'm, early
Noice👍🏽
Ive always wanted a frilled dragon!!! Glad to see they are friendly!
Where is the velvet ant video
Ummm frilled dragons live in deserts
Bfun fact: birds are the closest related species to dinosours so technically those with chickens are the closest to having dinos as pets. And kroks (or alligators i always get the 2 confused) where already living when the dinosaurs did
He's remaking jurassic park!!!!! 🦖🦕🌴

This animals called road lizard and it’s very much related to the Dilophosaurus is a large dinosaur that has a humungous frill that can spit out poison that blind its target. You’re welcome. 0:07
Wooooooooooooooooooooooo
Fun fack: Chickens came frome Dinos!
Cool animal, few things to note though, frilled dragons often get put in too high of humidity, the Australian ones live in arid areas and tropical grasslands and scrubland, never let humidity exceed 75% for Australian frilled dragons(50-70% is good, the upper ends would only be reached periodically in the rainy season) if you do respiratory illness will quickly follow. your little dragon wont stay small for long and the Australian frilled dragons can exceed 90cm in length (larger than he PNG ones) they are voracious, also in the wild I've always found they prefer vertical trees and stumps, so give him some of those, they like to shimmy around them to get out of sight

If you guys don’t know how it looks like a dinosaur it a relative of the dilophosaurus which lived mostly in deserts or in swamps and bogs and they have those flaps that come out when they’re angry
