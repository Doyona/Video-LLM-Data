I hate winter
8:28 awkward………🙄
end of video 31:51
8:28 well that aged well
nico doesn't no to give a bomb
No one saw gladiator obviously. "Whatever comes through those gates, we have a better chance of survival if we work together." Immediate chaos. 😂😂
Strength and honor
2 morons with psyche degrees trying to psyche each other out 😂😂😂. I say that with all the love in the world 😂😂😂.
I hate these kinds of games. The worst of us
🙊🙊🙊🍑⛓️
Grand Theft Auto Squid Game.
Im enjoying these vids but bruh - how many times u can say lock it in. -_-
Noooooooooooooooo I wanted to see lazerbeam got to five stars
Und wenn der Kabelturm so old scool ist, dass man Ding nicht verstellen kann ?😂  Kann man nur im stehen vorgebeugt von ganz unten ziehen als würde man ein Rasenmäher starten 😅
Cray is annoying
4:19 the Sound 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Question - why are the majority of the players wearing the suits + motorcycle helmets? Why not just give the players individuality and use their own avatars?
Bring the sidemen
just like in the newest video darkviper is being a dick and throwing.
7:10 he knocked all of them out 😂
How da fuk do people who make there living playing video games not know how to swim or punch?
This looks so fun 😂😂
Closing the video instantly when Lanon dies
15:26 Classic psych degree nonsense. xD
As a none GTA player these videos are hilarious
Another top notch video!❤👏
“Hell yeah! … Wow that guy’s kind of a Dick.” 😂
I left when lazar died
I wish they give expertThief more screen time. Bros Og asf. But im see laza's wife more, and it feels like watching a lost child 💀
When Landon dies I’m out 😂
Yes, I am entertained.
😂😅😂😅 Run for your lives😂😅😂😅😂😅
How do they make thase crazy things
31:31 crazy
17:32 let's goo
How do I get into something like this! I play on Xbox I assume I need to be on PC? Doesn’t anything like this happen on Xbox?
As soon as lazarBeam died I was going to leave
3:02 i died lmao the camera man running away
I left when Lannan died
Stopped watching once lazerbeam died 😂
Not cray with the Bluetooth air
FUN FACT : Fasffy taught lisa how to transfer bomb and lisa showed it to fasffy and lisa did it very well 🤣
More xpertthief
Winter looks like a 90's lesbian mom
lol idiots refuse to eliminate someone because they are a girl. SMH horrible survival instincts.
Bean pulling a thanos on darkviper was peak 😭
Bean bag moved during red light to kill dark viper
Who plays the reporter I wanna follow him on twitch😂😂😂
For the wanted boys 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Putting 3 people in one box was a shot in the foot. It gave them no advantage whatsoever and it was tantamount to them decreasing the amount of battleships they have on the board by stacking them on top of each other. If the enemy is unlucky, they will still have to shoot all three fields to hit them all, but if they get a lucky shot, they can take out 3 ships with one shot.
Cray sprayed the inhaler on his face 😂
You gotta level up your girlfriend 2:48
Whoever made this channel tell clay Dark Viper will always come back I really dislike cray for what he just did Dark Viper how about you go ahead next to the green light do the same thing to him
24:17 since when can xam count 😂😂
TEAM RED SENDS ITS REGARDS!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pick 3 me lord is a proper IYKYK😂 🪞
What in the squid games is this? Your evil!
I’m going to see wifey (gets hit by a car)
17:53 BeanBag casually dropping the coldest line in the video
That one guy was obviously stream sniping or meta gaming lmao, he only kept saying the two doors the people were behind 😅😂
No is cray winda one lest see
Bro gey out

Title: Escape room, the game: Squid games
Why did that man have to save his self save laserbeam’s girlfriend
Big bag sucks
Please make dark viperwin
Why lazarbeam die the video is not fun now
This is what the face of a thrilling content looks like
I exited the video at exactly 5:40 😂
Let’s go winter 🥶 ☃️⛄️❄️
Ngl I feel like it’s rigged for cray he has plot armor.
I love you BEANBAG 😢😢
😢😢
We love Kevin lasean
KARMAA FOR BEAM BAG I LOVE VIPER
Marcus wearing squid game player 456😂
This just show Lazer is a good boyfriend
I love how Marcus is wearing a squid game jacket
5:36 Most saddest death in 1-3 Star challenge.
20:12 and you know what else is massive? LOWWWWWW
Wow. 22:10. “Team red sends their regards” in that accent is top tier comedy 😂 should’ve been in peaky blinders.
This channel would do so much better if Cray wasn't in it
List Deadliest Escape room: Level 1 Escape Celling Water tank With Shark. Level 2 Bomb Game. Level 3 IDK? What is Game Choose Number Piston Pulling. Level 4 Red Light, Green Light With Car driving. Level 5 Gladiator Colosseum Battle.
" Wow that guy's kind of a dick " 😂😂
ME LORD!!!😅😅😅😅
Got those degrees but still playing video games for money lol, prob make more money doing that
Why does everyone in this video suck at videos games ?
26:44 THERE AREN’T COUGARS IN MISSIONS!!!
They need to bring this game to adversary mode ASAP 😂
FINALY A BATTLE OF THE MINDS😏
as soon as lazer died i left the episode.
Better than Squid Games? Yes.
10:57 literally the same as the series gin-hun and sangwoo during the 3rd game or mingle from the second season , crust is gin hun and dark viper is sangwoo and develique is san byeok, the director is literally the frontman and bazza is thanos along dusty who is  namgyu,  expert is ali, lisa is player min su & Lazar is semi, dark viper is deok-su, literally squid game 1 + 2 combined yo
The yellow leader dude be giving off squid games frontman vibes  All in favor  👇
2:58 2:58
We are wating this type of edition @Sidemen
I cried irl when modest pelican died.
I enjoyed this easily as much as a very expensive MrBeast video of the same style
Whatever happened to elsa's brother? didn't he use to make videos? what was him name again? Mooselk?
imagine ilsa wins one
20:11 m-massive
Lazer saved his girlfriend by killing himself with the bomb
I HATE DARKVIPER IN THIS VIDEO HE REALLY GRINDED MY GEARS🤬🤬🤬
Those who aren’t from tick tock can like this video. YouTube people ONLY
“We’ve got a battle of two people with psych degrees oh god”  😭😂😭😂😭
Anyone else rewatching all the videos? The editing is so on point I always binge these hoping for a new one.
This is not an escape room. Its squid game
Absolute cinema😂
RIP Lazarbeam
1:13 darkviperau
Pick 3 ✌🏽mi lord😂😂😂
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?!?!?
I sumhow feel winter is the main antagonist
Noooooooo lazer!!!!!!!
bro lazar died so quick and he best
Why does Cray sound like a straight up Bond villain at 11:25 😂😂😂
3:31 We just lost a player who died?
for the 3rd challenge, there’s a bit of math that goes into it, so the best strategy to minimize the chance of your opponent guessing all your coins is to spread them across 6 unique slots, as this reduces the probability of losing all your coins to about 0.0000000954, since the chance of guessing each slot correctly decreases exponentially. If spreading feels too risky, a good alternative is to group your coins into 3 clumps of 2, which keeps the probability of losing everything at around 0.0000391. Clumping fewer groups increases risk (e.g., 2 clumps of 3 coins have a 0.0039 chance of total loss), and putting all your coins in one slot is the riskiest, with a 0.0625 chance. Essentially, spreading out is the safest, while small clumps offer a decent balance.
you guys should recreate the hunger games
Future MrBeast
True
27:40 Are you not enterntained :)?!
There are tigers in missions
Blame it on the captain after stacking up against captain's orders. Lol
Cray won
LoserFruit is adorable
Why is it only the main guys win. Why cant someone else win for once
WHY COULDN'T THE BOMB CLIMB THE BLOCKS
I bet designing these levels takes a ton of skill. Im glad they do it tho. So much better than regular rp
INSANE
Left after Lannon died……..jk
i like cray in every video
Cray, now is my nemesis, The moon shall set for you soon, I shall enter the most wanted and you will never be most wanted again muhahahhaha.
Lazar doing the griddy in the background 4:38
"That's it?"😂😂😂😂😂
cray is WAY to animated for me, its very off putting, but I do enjoy these videos
When Cray jumped up at 9:48 and then abruptly shoved his hands down in front of his crotch I swear I thought he had forgotten he wasn't wearing any pants or something...
Lazars last words at 5:40 was my exact words for the video as well :)
Does modest pelican have a YouTube channel
Lazar died and so did the video
Viet nam vs viet blue 10:15
6:00  bro just said the n word
LISTEN TO DA MANNN 8 OR 16
I don’t wanna be rude and hated but viper didn’t do that much wrong they voted him as team captain against his will started revolting and when they lost when they told him what to pick they said HE was bad so I think he was justified also I think they just don’t like how good viper is because they are mad about him betraying the enemies they got out themselves so yeah
26:10 dit is het jachtseizoen
NOOOOO LB
MORE WANTED
Quit the game when lazar lost
Stopped at 5:37
fasfy and lazarbeam are both so nice for letting isla live fasfy litterally said pass it to me and lazar refused to kill her.
I hate when lazar always defeated in these videos
Clear stream sniping in that 3rd room lol
22:08 oh man it so terrifying 😢😂😂😂
Faffsy is OG for that. Lazer good for you man
Ngl i stopped watching when lanen died
6:00 did he just say what I think he said did he say the n word
Red team sends their regards 😂
Cray: I know you! RLGL Goon: NO.
Turn to Jesus Christ Amen ✝️
Rescan cougars hit different
Just how staged are you're videos? not complaining, just wanna know
1k more veis to get 1mil
Who is the Wanted Goon? Is this a journey to find out? The plot!
can we all agree on how shit they are at gta?
I feel like the red light green light game was rigged for plot and get people they wanted to the end
BeanBag got karma for killing an expert GTA player lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need XpertThief in one of these again bro please🙏
Nah bro why the stuktv music from jachtseizoen at 26:25
It was karma for BeanBag
Viper
What the fuck
Once lazarbeam got eliminated, I stopped watching fr
You KNOW Ilsa gave Lannan the sloppiest of toppies for not giving her the bomb when he had the chance.
Fortnite spelers Team
6:07 what did he sayyyy???
6:08 wait what
The second song that plays in Bomb Tag is a beautiful song! ❤
It wasn’t as good without lazarBeam
Crazy is just annoying I don't get why everyone wanted him to win
It's definitely not squid games
Bazz, you’re doing a great job bud!
Holy this video is a big W dark viper modest pelican dam didnt expact that collab ❤
we want more!!!!!
We need more wanted videos!!!!!!
Nah this is the new click
8 OR 16!!!!
yep GET lazar OUT right off the bat and lose views, GJ, SMART ON YOUR PART MATES LOLZ ENDED IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DEATH. DONT EVEN CARE FOR THE 2ND HALF IF THERE IS EVEN ONE
How do I become a member? So I can watch the members only videos
4:59 this guy is dancing got me laugh 😂
I ask DarkViperAU if he knew the next wanted Vid and said yes
Bro sounds different
Cray was indeed Locked in
Lazarbeam  Make a new episode  of   my strangest Addiction
Marietta Ridge
Can you do squid game
ik i can't be the only one who heard something at 6:06
I came here from the DarkVipers video and found ExpertThief no way love that guy.
It should have been ilsa she would make a great underdog
Morar Lock
I left after Lazar got blown up
I think the stream frame should be in the middle below, because it is harder for the human eye to look back and forth than up and down, and when watching, it is difficult to consume all the content because I keep looking at the stream frame and the scene in the middle. The human brain can only focus on one thing when watching, Mr Beast does this better. I think this is the reason why this youtube channel invests a lot but the views do not reach 10 million per video.
Lannan as always be a great man for his women
This channel is so amazing
Modest pelican nooooo 4:36
The most inconsistent channel I’ve ever seen on YouTube I can see why click broke up because half the people here are so inconsistent and unoriginal that they thought they can do it by themselves when all they are or has been creators still trying to live off Fortnite.
I was rooting for cray the whole time cause he's the only one who made me laugh 😂😂
2:24 why is that guy overacting???
Eleazar Port
IS THAT MY GOAT XT TRIPLE OG

Kinda boring once lazerbeem died
Where’s LankManDan????
L died, video now unwatchable
@XpertThief on point with the numbers, love to see my favourite YouTuber get a wanted poster in the future🤞
I hate how Darkviper betrayed his team NO SPORTSMANSHIP NO HONOR When he bumps him i love how Darkviper dies in happiness that he loses
We need Landon for the views is hilarious

Escape
What about an x men challenge we’re everyone starts not knowing wich side there on or what there abilities are, the people with access to iron man level technology or something vs the people with random powers. I don’t know anything about mods but I know there’s slow falling and laser vision mods in gta so powers might be something that can be coded
Plot twist: during a game a person assassinates the director
29:02 😂😂😂😂😂
Xpert, Peli, & DarkViper all in a Wanted video is something I would have only thought of in a dream, but it turns out to be reality🔥
DarkViper got snubbed. I love it. That’s usually how it goes for him lol 😂
GTA 5 is a crazy game but it’s fanbase is far crazier. For better and worse. Mostly better..?
Nah this is why we haven’t seen uploads on lazerbeams channel
6:09 WHAT DID HE SAY
I just saw this and wunderd if you named yourself wanted because it what you've always wanted

lmaooo
4:38 Lazarbeam just griddying in the background
4:18 “EueauAHghhhh” 💀🙏🏿
Let viper win boo youtubers
Lannan not giving Ilsa the bomb was sweet, but Fasffy TAKING the bomb from Ilsa was amazing. That woman is blessed with the best circle of people.
zesty ass video ngl
26:19
My boy Peli was not sufficiently hydrated.
the 'r u not entertained!?' line was funny.
I really though bro was pulling out a vape 2:24 😂
I love this channel
Blue sold stacking up
Winter is the biggest bitch for hitting ilsa 😭
we need @modestpelican in a hitman outfit next time
I root for Ilsa so hard in every video
22:19 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DARKVIPERAU RIGGED LOL 😂

My vote is darkviperau his got this in the bag baby

My favourite video so far 🔥
Xpert had to put a light on in this video lmao. Dark ahh dude
lufu dying in the beginning is a CRIME
Post more daddy lazer
Lazar was robbed
Fasffy and lazarbeam are a vibe so admirable 😢
Lannan refusing to give Ilsa the bomb was really sweet. He’d never do that to his queen, his love. 😂
Spoiler people live and then die
Please make more videos frequently
Nobody escapes an escape room. Because like hell you would've escaped with one missing finger and two toes decapitated by a saw machine.

The one person I cannot stand wins. Idk why he does but he just irritates me. But I love the videos guys and the whole setup n everything that goes into these videos!
Can you do other escape rooms video

Finally modestPelican and darkviperau are in these
I mean if I was darkviper I would of also picked myself to keep going seeing how my team didn’t listen to him when he asked them to split up, also that red light green light was was wayyyyyy to forgiving
What game is it made in? Gta?
You guys are freaking epic😂
"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:1-10)  ''Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.   (Ephesians 5:14)
Never knew Xpert was in these videos, glad too see him in heree!❤️

The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) hosted a hearing on March 20, 2024: “Stopping the Crime of Organ Harvesting—What More Must Be Done?” Four witnesses testified during the hearing and provided detailed action that can be taken to end forced organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).   The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) held a hearing on March 20, 2024 to stop forced organ harvesting in China.
Tbh this channel is poorly advertised and is kinda lame
3:28 how did it go from 18 to 17
Who is wanted?
"We need Lannan do for the views!"   you're right. I only watch these videos because of Lazarbeam. I immediately clicked off the video as soon as he died. see you guys in the next video. 🤣
We need an Ilsa Wanted poster. Get it queen. 👑
i am not watching this bc lazarbeam isn’t in it
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINEDDDDD
Anyone else notice the crab games map on the bomb tag challenge?
Bule is my team
Do daily videosss
Get Muselk and get rid of Loserfruit. Generally she’s so dull.
If only the tigers were cougers...
This is the worst fucking video you guys have ever made where the fuck are the main characters
22:47 YAY
22:21 F*** beanbag

Dark viper AU in this is crazy! Would love to see more of him in these!
Cray won 3 times now this is starting to feel rigged
jigsaw moments
Class move by Fasffy there!!!!
Beanbag is such a dick :/
Where is GrayStillPlays? The Florida man himself should be in these videos.
Whoever's idea was to put 3 people on a single number....
Thanks ❤❤❤❤❤
to be fair to Lannan he did hit someone and didn't transfer
Bro  He said Nigga
Finally I’ve been waiting
Papa Peli❤
Icl I love these types of video's but they scream the entire time so I just can't watch this anymore 😭
The Lazarbeams - Ilsa - Fasffy beef is very hilarious. Very subtle hints. And i must say, Ilsa sarcasm is topnotch and i believe, from what I have seen, Ilsa and Lazarbeam do have great chemistry 😂😂😂
Rip modest pelican
Me who clicked off when lazar died😂😂😂  Jk I watched all the way through quality vid
Watching Cray is pure entertainment 🙏
we need lannan for the views is wild
Squid game season 2 leak
Cray is the goat!

W outro.😂
Yes cray yes!
Cray is hilarious 😂
XpertThief W
Bro they changed the sound of the commenter
1:58 FruitCALVO😂
I'm new to this wanted channel, but have been watching these guys for years.  Is this the first video DarkViper has been in? Him and Cray are my favorite, nice to see them in the same video!
I waited this long for a wanted video and lazar loses that fast…. Also Xamaus is a b*tch for trying to make friends at the end. He gave up the win. It’s on him.
Happy to see darkviper
the good old lazar simp
So my boy muselk just not going to be a part of these?
As an Irish man.... the irish lads accent is so fake and put on. Stereotypical fool. Get a grip.
R.i.P Lazarbeam 😢😢
Fasffy is a true friend.
I was so happy when that Irish guy went out
6:08 , tf did bro say?
6:08 bro said the word
Unbelievable Video again guys! Cant Wait for future videos to come.       Wanted Forever!
Winter needs to win one

What did he say😂 6:08
fuck I love these
Was so fun participating in this! Great video again all!
Papa peli, you were taken too soon
Awesome
Lazarbeam only died bc he was so cocky to dance😂
lazar threw on purpose there.... dude was watching the bomb the whole time and let them hit him
5:41 *leaves video because he's dead now*
Such a good video!! @wanted-
make a video but the winner is loserfruit
Last bit felt scripted
wanted vids are the best 👍
16:20 the shark tank song😂😂
Why this is not on my recommendation list??
This is what YouTube was made for
this video pissed me off man , it's fun and annoying to watch
Literally one of, if not my favorite channel now lol, and i haven't played GTA in a whilee
why didnt blaza have his iconic mic
I was wondering who's the MC of the events Who's the man behind all the games?
I'm constantly blown away by the creativity of this channel. The way these custom games are built, edited, organized is amazing. I've been gaming for 40 years. Watching the evolution of gaming, from where we started to what can be done now, is just jaw-dropping.
mans really had one chance and wasted it by saying "we can split it"
isnt darkviper that guy who tried to expose moistcritikal?
You KILLED PAPA PELLI!!! YOU B*STARDS!
Pick 3 me lord
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!
:D
I love when Cray wins 😂
Are we not entertained?
Hey what? 6:10
nooo papa peli died so early.
Poor ilsa 😢
Haha awesome. Please bring modest pelican back on! he might not be good at challenges but he's so dam funny
These videos are so good, you guys deserve much more views and subs!!❤
Modest Pelican cameo?!
Lazedbeam trash
Holy shii! Such a great video!!! Well done! Gave me Mr.Beast vibes I would like to see more in this structure
8:51
I like how they let everyone participate in the end. I also loved how bazz hyped up cray.
This is one of my favs
I thought this was an irl Mr. Beast video at first
thats cool a wanted players
I’m not good enough to be in the vids, good luck to those who try to join👍. Lmk how it goes.
his  to Lazarbeam, he's true blue He's a pisspot through and through He's a bastard so they say Meant to go to heaven but he went the other way He went down, down, down, down Sip, sip, sip What do we think of Lazarbeam? He's alright! -laserbeam biggest fan
Team red sends their regards
Unlucky tgg❤ maybe next time also congrats cray
bro xpert needs to pipe it
Winter seems super annoying
THIS IS SPARTA!!!!!
5:34 I guess I’ll never know how it ends
Cray is the greatest of us all.
Papa Peli failed to hydrate
seriously these episodes get more and more amazing. One of the greatest channels on the internet. Love everything you are doing.
Crays energy is unmatched 😂👌🏻
Why does cray overreact every time
goated ahh channel
Lindo do you wanna play south bronx
We need more xam
I was here for expert thief please show him more
It’s too easy for cray
peak youtube
here are the most wanted people, SPOILERS for all of the other Wanted videos Lazarebeam, the most wanted youtuber Livbev and Juicy, Most wanted Couple Stinekb and Shadyobster56, most wanted escaped Prisoners Crayator, Raidojackie, Treline and Shadowless, most wanted by the goverment because they want to keep the zombie thing Quiet Bazza and Juanito, most wanted by the aliens because they killed their king no one was, most wanted for this one, the police found 50 of the body but the others, they where in a volcano the 2 assassings in the poster, wanted for killing the president Cray, he is now the MOST WANTED PERSON OUT OF EVERYONE WITH 2 WANTED POSTERS!
Back shots
Lowkey wanted becoming one of the top gaming groups
I was right on the guess. Way to go cray.
DarkViper choosing himself has to be one of the most unhinged part of the video
What’s with that limo? Lmao
Hello I’m a real human and this is a great funny video love it!
challange number three went on for way too long that was not fair they got to guess more than half the board kind of ruined it for me still a funny video thou
Another quality production from the @wanted crew!!!  Watch out @rackaracka
Just watched the latest Wanted video and wow, it was phenomenal! The production quality keeps getting better and better, and the content was both engaging and insightful. Kudos to the team for another amazing video – can’t wait to see what’s next!
I am a fake lasagna.
Great video as always....The bald guy is kinda cool....I think he streams too...Bazza I think it is
bazz told me to comment something a real person would say.
LOOVED this vid guys x
I'm a grandma that just learned how to use a keyboard...   Good  video
I’m a real person and I think this video was pretty cool 👍

I am a real person
"I am an actual person.  This comment was made by a real person."
bazz told me to write a comment so he know that real people watch and comment
I am an actual person.  This comment was made by a real person. This video was amazing.
Im a human
Hello I am a real viewer! I enjoyed this video and this video made me like and subscribe to Wanted!
Bazz told me to comment something that made me sound human, great vid tho
I’m a real person
I wanted the Fortnite boys to win so bad 😂
kind of a weird choice to not have the limo center with the stairs at 24:11. But good video otherwise!
The fact that its always one of the 4 that win like give other ppl a poster xam or winter deserved that poster
Let’s go new video!!!🎉
Karma lol 22:04 - 22:41

There aren't any cougars IN MOST WANTED ~viper if he arrived at the last challenge~
The Fasffy sacrifice is a thing of legend! Shout out to Dev, LUFU and Ilsa. Townie, you steal every scene. 😂
OUT OF CONTEXT HUMOR 😂😂😂  25:34 - wait wait wait ww-w-w-w-wait - Townie you stink! alright are you...  okay... buddy.

I would love to join these one day😂🙏🏾🙏🏾
Finally
My goat Cray winning again 🏆 🏆 🏆
I love watching wanted it reminds me of old gta
How has Bean Bag not gotten out when he pushed DarkViped
Wait was that supposed to be the creep host from fame or shame 😂
Papa Peli of course survived the water round but him and bombs don't mix.
I need crays energy.
Was I not on point with the numbers tho?
Having lazar and loserfruit already gone and not even half way is so sad
Evil mrbeast in gta
Freaking love this channel
Rip modest pelican
Nooo not papa peli going out in the second room :(
3hours
lazar beam can you pls add me in fortnite
DarkViperAU in a lazarbeam video, that is crazyyy
Nice vid
Lazar died I am disappointed
Pelican should have moisturized the bomb fuse...
Red pill win
Just let pasar win
I wanted lazer to win
Honestly I feel like some of these guys make stupid choices on purpose for the sake of content, like at 4:00. It's kind of sad honestly
Cray screaming " DONT ASSAULT THE JOURNALIST" , FREE PALESTINE ,FREE PALESTINE
👌👍👌
I like how darkviperau is here
𝔸𝕪𝕪 𝕝𝕖𝕥'𝕤 𝕘𝕠🔥🔥🔥🔥
7:43 yea Fasffy do be like that.
Congratulations to Craystar for being most wanted
GUYS ARE FUCKED UP ALWAYS GETTING LAZER BEAM OUT FIRST 10 min of the videos ALWAYS
Why do they act so extra lmao
INVITE THE SIDEMEN IN THE NEXT WANTED
These are so awesome.  I wish they uploaded more often
Leonard literally got put out just so he didn't have to finish the video! So stupid and I'm done watching this shit if no one is actually trying. Kinda stupid at that point. Should have kept the integrity of the dumb content if you actually want views, js
Darkviper jump scare
Glad to see dark viper in these videos
22:45 karma time!
bazzL
yaaaaah, new video
"Pick 3 m'lord ✌️ " - Marcus    Nice Shrek reference 👌
so brave of wanted to break his streak of saying "new video soon" for the past 1 months
Finally they posted
this 🔥 ass content . basically Mr> Beast but GTA RP so its deadlier 😭
hey is it was bingo on the third room. Red Team would have got a line going down
8 or 16 💀moment
YOU GUYS GOT TE GAMING LEMON IN TIS!?
Bruh the second Lazor died I was like "i have no one to root for. Idk who to root for now" but then I decided I like Cray...i guess I have a type 😂😂
Team under 1 hour
Enjoying these videos so much, and always great to see new faces too, like the gorgeous Develique i didn't knew till now. 27:16
23:32 Idk why that sent me😂😂
DarkViperAU dying to a cougar woulda been so ironic
So good
MODEST PELICAN DIDNT DESERVE TO DIE
I can't believe my backstabbing somehow led to me being stabbed in the back. I've learned my lesson—next time, I'll backstab even more people so there's no one left to betray me. A foolproof strategy.
purge
Omg finally
OMG FINALLY
so brave of darkvipers team to sacrifice themself for him 🫡🫡🫡
WANTED is just casually making masterpieces!
Wanted Matto to win :(
I LOVE IT
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!!!
W! Wanted is such a excellent channel to go to when no other videos are entertaining.
Your back guys 🎉🎉
6:08 💀💀💀
Put lazar as thumbnail and he out in 2nd round 😅
It was really funny seeing viper just choose himself immediately
SO CLOSE YET SO FAR 😥
Yeas less go we finally have darkviperau on wanted
Cray is such a drama queen, losing breath after putting in a code and swimming out of a tank, OMG that was so intense, I don’t know how much more of this I can handle. ITS A VIDEO GAME calm down
Its official darkviperau is the number 42 of wanted videos
5:29: "we need landon for the views"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
viper is not gonna be in the next video because he killed isla
Matto was in the video, nice.
I rewatched the start 2 min to make sure it was the DARKVIPER AU
Omg I fort he quit 😂😂😂😂😂 welcome back
Looks like fruity throw so she doesn’t have to record 😂
darkviperau
Will you pin this comment if i said the channels amazing without muselk
Blue would’ve had the win if they didn’t put 3 people in one box
Viperau here aswell
Finally THE DarkViperAU is in this videos
viper shouldve chosen ilsa to surivive
.
Six minutes in and Lannans dead. I'm committed so i'll watch to the end but I already know its not as good as it could have been. Fingers crossed Ilsa makes it.
should be 19.5 Youtubers with how infrequent Cray uploads 🤣
A bit suss that they kept voting down left side , like they knew they had to be there
6:05 WAS CLOSE
the fact that beanbag took out darkviperau in the green light red light.. now i hate him
I want more lazarbeam 😅
50minutes
50mins
Bro where have you guys been
Finally, mate. I’ve been waiting
6:07
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I don’t know who’s idea it was too make this channel but bless the one who came up with the idea these are the best
under 1 hour gang
It's already great enough to see other YouTubers like XpertThief, TGG and DarkViperAU in these videos (along with other friends of the Wanted boys) but I like how Cray also referenced the fact that DarkViper has actually played GTA for 10k hours and it's just little details like that where it shows that these guys do their research on who they're getting for these videos.
I WANT MORE DARKVIPERAU
24:16 LOL the editor did him dirty
Finally I've been waiting for months
I sooooo want to be in one of these videos.
"We need Lannan for the views, don't let him explode" lmao
I like matto being here please continue
3:50 am this uploaded in sydney New South Wales and i watched it
Squid Game season 2 step aside. This is the real stuff.

This channel is what I wanted Click to do 4 years ago. We love to see it
are you not entertained!
Whos the directer?
W CRAYNATION!!!!🎉🎉🎉
the fact beanbag didnt die when he drove on red light to push viper is a small issue, but he died next round so ig it doesnt matter lol
Love seeing Ilsa finally doing videos
Man this was one of the best videos you’ve done yet!!! The showmanship, the teamwork, the excitement… it was all there!!!
Laser beam can you start doing more content by yourself?
