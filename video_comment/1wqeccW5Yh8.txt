Here's my Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms Teaser video with more first looks and easter eggs from HBO. Full Trailer video posting later this week! Here's my House Of The Dragon Season 3 video too! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Z2-VumulE&t=0s
Dunk’s real name is not Duncan the Tall. Egg gave him that name to help him sound more like a knight, which he is not.
30 mins !!! Why even make it just keep it
I really have developed a soft spot for ser Duncan the tall, and egg of course, can't wait to see them on screen
i keep wonderinghow brienne comes from them. is selwyn somehow decdnded from themor her mother..neither dunk or tansellle arenobles
6:24 Aemon may be shown in the second or third seasons, since sometime after the events of the first book, Dunk and Egg travel to Oldtown and actually meet him.
We would see Brynden rivers the tree eyed raven however he is a lot older than Duncan the tall and Aegon targaryen, we would see a young version of aemon Targeryan the the brothers of the night watch the maester
Just in case people are wondering, You don't have to read the novella's The Novel "A Knight of the seven Kingdom's" released in 2015 has them in a single volume.
There was no debate at all. Dunk was never knighted. His lie was a prominent subtext throughout and the whole point is the irony that he is more a true knight than the real knights.  Not to be snarky since making all these videos is difficult but you should probably read the novellas in full rather than the summaries.
*you win a little money for getting past the first round—Sir Arlan was not winning these tournaments against legendary knights.
Looks to have a ton of potential. I like the simplistic approach to story telling. GOT was epic, at first.  We will see I suppose.
What house does ser Duncan belong to
"snackable"
Only a half hour per episode? Almost feels like they are rushing this just to get eyeballs
GRRM claims he's going to write more on this series....    lol.  Surrrrrrrrrrrrrre.
I try to read A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms at least once a year. great stories
It is at the peak of my Powerr...!!!
This is my favorite story in the entire series. This will be gooooddd
Trailer coming out tomorrow let’s gooooo ❤❤❤❤
Yo are we all just going to ignore that image in the first 20 secs 😭😭😭
George R. R. Martin can’t catch a break 😭🤣He will be writing until he croaks dealing with us 😂
there's enough story for a 2nd season even a 3rd between 1st and 2nd novelas before going to the 2nd novel story... going south to Dorne, horse dies, they visit Aemon on citadel, egg get's maester the mule, etc etc... not very specific if it's in the way back or still going to dorne they were part of the hightower navy figthing pirates and probably ironborn, then they did get to dorne where Dunk get's his new tunik with Dorne's fabrics and paint not sure if they met Tansel I mean there's pretty much a good season in all that and GRRM isn't planning to do a novel about that part since he's fwd in time at that point in Dunk and Eggs story byt the 3rd novela
I was just thinking "sounds like A Knights Tale", as you start showing clips from it 😂😂
Why tf is Dunk so small?  They really couldn’t have gotten someone even close to his size to play him?
This premise seems so much tamer than GoT and House of the Dragon. Hope its not dull
I’m really sick of GRRM. He’ll eat himself to death before we get the last two books. It’s apparent he has no idea how to end it.
If you need to hold a sword hold it like you are going to use it. Haha sorry.hold it as you wish.
Why are you holding a sword as a nerd.
To be honest, House of the dragon was not interesting. I was really waiting for this show
The hand and the feet😅😅😅😅
7:50 Ugh, so you mean this story is incomplete too?
Egg calls some people on their bs often in the book
Lord Charles FLEXIN' with his gotdamned sword...... and I'm here for.
This story takes place during the later years of the blackfire rebellions, so the political aspect of this show should be just as interesting.
Stephen Miller was the weird kid in high school that the other kids only talked to to secretly make fun of him. You can tell the other kids are just encouraging him to say weird shit.
I think of Dunk and Egg as Mark Twain in Westeros. Very much Huck Finn and Prince and the Pauper vibes. I also think GRRM already finished WOW and ADOS, but he'll have it published posthumously because he doesn't want to hear all our complaints.
8:04: "When he says he's going to write something..." Don't believe him.
So Charlie, is this about 50-100 years before GoT?
I have an idea.  Why doesn't George finish the Song of Fire and Ice..........
THE FEET!!😂😂😂
This looks like it’s going to be the best GOT content since the original first 4 seasons of GOT. So excited. Dunk and egg is rivals the original story in story telling and even more enjoyable at times. Hopefully GRRM can write a few more novelas
Filmed 40mins from my house, parts of the mountains was closed for near a week looking forward too it
I want arya Stark show when she goes west, after the end of the main show. A pirate style Game of Thrones show  With her the Head character.
Brienne does not descend from Tanselle
That's a shame, Ifeel like the opening title song has become a staple in watching these shows, I love the books and shows and that opening still gives me goosebumps and gets me excited to watch an episode.
According to the producers, there will no magic and dragons this will be just a drama set in a medieval world. I hope they stick to that rule and not introduce fantastical elements.
i saw a knights tale scene lol . .
My one hope is they don't reuse the GoT theme for the intro again. I need some unique separation.
사실상 드래곤이 등장하지 않아야 몰입도가 크다
Im pretty convinced GRR martin and HBO are doing all these prequels to built up to a game of thrones reboot, since after the prequels enough time will have passed (10-20 years) and this time it will have more book accuracy and accurate book ending (GRR will probably be dead), this is why he is building trust with a new generation of HBO creators.  Or he is full on fukital mode, and is just grabbing bags by milking what little IP he has left.
I don't know why they skip blackfyre rebellion?
I’m so behind… After Game Of Thrones, I left the entire series because I felt that the story was completed properly… Once I found out that there was gonna be ANOTHER series, I just quit…
There’s a lot to still learn about the history and show. Yet Sir Dunk will probably be one of my favorites he is eveyone who wanted to change careers and can do the job well with no degree or certificate but ends up finding leaders who take a chance on him while he strives to be successfully qualified!
I'm probably not watching this, there are so many other stories to tell in this universe and we can't get out if Westeros
Hate that HBO told us Dunk knighted himself…just leave it up to interpretation…
I'm not waiting for Winds of Winter.  I just don't think it will happen.
30 minutes episodes? such a waste
I hate GRRM and HBO. Everyone wants ROBERTS REBELLION. These buttholes give us this stupid show.
Did he even finish the last book of game of thrones
Why doesn't George hire a team of writers giving them the main plot points to finish WOW and just edit it to his approval?
Everybody is just agreeing to revealing Egg I guess. WHat a shame for those who havent ready the book.
If these episodes and the season are so short they better freaking make this with no more than a year delay.
I want to see what happens after the ending of the game of thrones show. We got house of dragons (before game of thrones) now this 100 years before game of thrones. I hope we get an after game of thrones show would be cool
Martin needs to get off his lazy arse and finish the last two books of ASOIAF. That’s his legacy.
*spoilers ahead*  The Hedge Knight, in my opinion, is the most powerful piece GRRM has ever written. Even better than hold the door / Hodor.  Especially the last few paragraphs, asking if it was worth the life of a Prince to save a hedge knight's foot, a prince who was practically the kingdom's future. The answer was that there may come a time when the gods would have more use for a knight's foot than the Prince's life. In that moment, the reader suddenly realises that it was not Dunk's foot they were fighting for, but justice, and that the entire novella was a monument to how important justice is and how much people are willing to sacrifice for it.  I cannot imagine how the TV adaptation can do it justice.
The feet 😂😂
Since it's a smaller story I don't mind them just doing the action > boom title card > cut back to action. I like that direction.
cant wait to see who they got to be BAELOR BREAKSPEAR!!!
Charlie could you do an introdution of the characters of this show and theirs place inside the dragons's family? Simply who is who?
Anyone know where I can get cryogenically frozen until all the game of thrones books and shows have been released so that I don’t have to wait years and years to watch it all
Dunk and Egg. Once again I was impressed with scope - that bald kid is actually....WOW!
Been years waiting for a spinoff only to get the spinoff no one wanted... literally every other spinoff they were gonna do was gonna be better than this kot7k crap. O well... I'm gonna watch it of course lol just bc its got universe. But id of rather had any of the other spinoffs they were gonna do. Idk why they chose this it was the worst of the options imo anyway. I mean ill jus say 3. The first long night!! Ageons and his sisters conquest of westros!!! And my fav option... The doom of Valeria n all that !!!! Jus everything that was going on at that time in got history would of been my choice. Ok im done complaining now lol have a good day guys 😊
No starks?
Excuse me m’lord @EmergencyAwesome but how does one acquire the shirt you are wearing?
A knights tale storyline.
❤
Ser Arlen promised to Knight Dunk before he died. So Dunk was not really lying.
Please more battles less court drama
Yeah... the series about the Dance of Dragons, one of the most interesting parts of the game of thrones story.... and it sucks... But we should get excited about the non dragon show...
I hope Duncan was knighted, it will feel a bit cliche if it ends up like the knights tale movie.
please bro just finish the books! then do this shit.
Selwyn Tarth is the descendant of Daella Targaryen and Dunk.
The final episode will be Summerhall.
don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻 don't fuck it up 🙏🏻
Cool story bro, should have more dragons
0:53 you mean how quickly he can snake ideas from other lore before someone catches on and puts himself in another corner like he did with ASOIAF.  we have 3 of 7 hedgeknight books so far. Last time he started a TV show with this much book material what happened? Yeah you can say bye bye to the idea of getting a finished story from the Planetos universe. GEORGE is a hack writer
Who wants to bet they Make egg a girl with a shaved head pretending to be a boy...90% chance they do it. who want to bet?
This shit is why we won;t get Winds and Spring.
HBO couldn't make the absolute coolest story in the entire series good. You know... Dance of Dragons..... Ya this is gonna be much better. I'm surprised Dunk isn't a black chick
I tried watching House of the Dragon, but it was awful without any likeable characters, but Knight of the Seven Kingdoms came from good books.
I've always been in the camp of thinking that Ser Arlan never actually knighted Dunk, and that he lied about it all of those years. My personal theory for how it comes out is that when Aegon becomes king and wants to appoint Dunk to the Kingsguard, Dunk privately confesses the truth to him, thinking that he can't possibly be a Kingsguard when he's not really a knight. Aegon will reassure him that he's been everything a true knight could be for all of those years, then secretly knight Dunk himself (which he can do as king) to clear the way for him becoming a Kingsguard.
Tansele is going to be racially diverse now? How does that actually make sense?
This better be great storytelling because spins off rarely do well
I used to watch those comicon vids back in the day. That was peak entertainment game of thrones and  walking dead back in the day
i want roberts rebellion 3 part movie
I had to look up the gentleman who played maester aemon. I guess that actor passed away in 2016. I think I kinda remember hearing Abt that. It would be cool for a cameo or a nod somehow to him
The Hedge Knight -> clear references to A Knight's Tale -> which is based on Geoffrey Chaucer's A Knight's Tale -> it always all comes back to Chaucer, doesn't it
The fact that the South Park episode where Butters goes to GRRM's house to ask him how A Song of Ice and Fire ends is STILL RELEVANT 💀💀
LIKED
They have the same plot point of a squire pretending to be a knight in his dead charge's armor in Fallout.
This is the series I was looking forward to much more than the House of the Dragon show.
When will HBO make Aegon’s Conquest story and the story before that of Valeria , more houses that had dragons
Hmm hope all the budget cuts don’t impact what we are going to see. No real intro, 30 min episodes ..I’ve read the books n hope it stays true.
I think they’ll try to get two seasons in a row at least, so then they can alternate with HOTD
I cant wait and every time hbo and you talk about game of thrones..it becomes a banger 😂😂 thanx charlie
I am so excited for this series. I loved the books. Egg is such a well written character. Thanks, Charlie! Can’t wait for the episode breakdowns next year.
Nidge is back
No intro and only 30 minute episodes, sounds like their budget is trash compared to the other GOT series.
Aegon (Egg) is the fourth son of a fourth son. He’s 11th in line when the show starts and many of the male adults are still aged for having kids. For a modern comparison, I think the British line would have to get down all the way to Prince Andrew’s 2nd granddaughter (since it’s not patrilineal)
NGL, the beginning sounds VERY MUCH like A Knight's Tale! It's one of my favorite movies, so I guess that's not bad...
I’ve only read ONE entire book in my life and it was this series of stories. Absolutely loved it. Can’t wait for this to come out. I’M IN NEED OF SOME WESTEROS!!
Well this series may be a gamble if there are no dragons in the series.   They need great script writing.
I have to admit I’ll be coming back for this show. Haven’t been watching House Of The Dragon.   Dunk is one of the GOATs.
I just finished the hedge knight so I’m guessing it’s gonna be the first season. And then they’ll do the sworn sword and lastly the mystery knight
I hope the Knight of the Seven Kingdoms still uses the GOT theme music. Nevertheless I’m excited to see it. Thanks Charlie for the backstory.
Hopefully they don't butcher it like house of the dragon season 2
finally after a long drought something I want to watch on HBO.  I couldn't get into "Task".
I really enjoyed reading The knight of the seven kingdoms. books It will be nice seeing it on screen
I need a series set in Ashai
Do you think they’ll go through years up to Summer Hall?
Night the seven kingdoms is one of my favorite. It needs three seasons.
no way 30 mins eps??? thats a joke rite ???
We want a Damn John Snow show where he ends up in the damn throne!
Remember when GoT was peak for 6 years straight and they never skipped a year?
Winter is coming!
I remember watching your vids religiously when Game of Thrones was airing - it feels almost nostalgic to be back and dissecting trailers with ya! I'm honestly so pumped for this show
You need some outside influence protection with the Magneto mask? :) :D
I wish Disney warner bros etc would get to the point give us a new season on a yearly basis like it was like before streaming took off
i hope doing something different than the main series isn't gonna be like how they subverted  expectations or I'm gonna lose it
Dunc & Egg, the Batman & Robin of Westeros.
Intro is the main magnet for non readers
30 minute episodes! lol so dumb..
Can't wait for characters like Break spear the best king when never have plus Arron brightflame and laughing storm lyonel the laughing storm
Why the hell dont they do the age of heros or Bobby bs rebellion
It was a mistake to come right and say he knights himself; should've saved that bit. The element of surprise and all. HBO canonized it way too early, detracting from the emotional impact that was to come, a mistake. Why should I even watch it now? What exactly is the character arc for that most pivotal episode, divorced from his self-ascension? If that is the denouement, I feel satisfied I can skip the episode; If that is an indication of HBO's current story-telling ability, I'll pass on the series.
If this was written by Disney: "Name?" ... "Sir Duncan" "And family name?" ... "Well I don't have any family so that's a tall order." "Sir Duncan the Tall it is."
Love the mirrors of Dunk & Brienne with their best of actions despite unofficial knighted titles!
Mark Addy in the sitcom 'Still Standing' was really great. I really think it's one of the best shows for a laugh.
This is going to be weird an awesome with no intro
Hey Charlie.
New york comic con is going to be lit
I can't wait for this trailer next week
Great breakdown Charlie
The Hedge Knight might be my favorite content from the ASOIF universe.  Its like 80 pages and almost reads like a young adult novel.  its so simple and small scoped its almost romantic in way.  Even if you arent a reader, find the pdf on google and read a few paragraphs, you might end up half way through it before you realize.
I. Can't wait for this show
No intro is not good….
yeah right he's going to write another one.. don't hold your breath
Interesting to see what our favourite YouTubers look like.❤️
Guess my grandchildren are going to watch the following seasons LOL!!
By the time they release this, the young actor who plays Egg will be 18😭😭
no intro music?   I NEED to hear the song before any GoT related episodes....😅
idk why hbo dont just make a series start at aegon conquest and ends with robert rebellion. the hotd maybe stop at aegon 3rd coronation.
And in season 3, we should meet Walder Frey
I really liked the book. Very short reads
I WOULD SAY GAME OF THRONE WAS THE GREATEST SHOW EVER! I KNOW IT DIDNT END WELL! BUT UP TO THEN! THE WHOLE WORLD WAS WATCHING AND LOVING IT! IT BRANG US TOGETHER!
People should stop pushing martin, just accept it. He shared his world, he never had to, and it's d&d who messed the show up. I'm grateful he created such a large world and so many books as is
As a book reader just because HBO says something doesn't make it so .Come on George finsh the books
Any more delays & im gonna have to give hbo a clout in the ear.
i feel like we have been waiting for the 7 kingdoms for 7 years.. let's see what they'll show at NYCC this week
In the Seven Kingdoms there seems to be questions with everyone's parentage...
Random fan engagement
Meanwhile   Arya is out there somewhere   Lord snow is in the wild    And sansa still rules the north    But those arent any series we wanted 😔
The Hedge Knight is such a good graphic Novel series. Can't wait
“Just when I thought I was out. They pull me back in!”
00:07 only after the arm passes the head moves ...🤣
Hello everyone
he still has to finish Fire & Blood part 2 ...atleast 2 more short stories for A Knight of The Seven Kingdoms and the Winds of Winter and A Dream of Springs.....i dont think its ever going to happen unfortunatly
powerful emergency Charlie knights of egg awesomeness!
😮😮😮 wowo quieto ver ❤
So excited for more Game Of Thrones 🐉
LOL!A Knight’s Tale footage. Brilliant 😂
Thanks Charlie I have been looking forward to "The Knight of The Seven Kingdoms".
Imagine me being so smug having read the books way before GoT hit tv. And here I am, waiting... I wait, and I don't know things. 😂
I am obsessed with anything GoT! Don’t press George. `1st when it’s ready it will be perfection or damned near!
Just like to comment for the thing to do the thing. Jeremy Piven has the most pretentious stubble.
"The Hand"..... "The Feet"..... you b@stard, Hahahaha
Extremely Happy we are getting 2 series from Westoros!! Dunk the Lunk thick as a Castle Wall”
I haven't even read any of the books I'm just waiting on the show and than wait for Charlie to explain it to me! Thanks Charlie you're the best I come to you after every episode and have been a huge fan for years! Keep up the great work can't wait to see all your hard work threw these episodes 🤘
This will kind of be a standalone show, right?  I get so confused about all the lineage. How many Aegons were there anyway?   I mean, am I supposed to remember all the lore to enjoy this?
We are going to get some major story developments in Jan 2026
But will there be White Walkers?
I hate the 30 min decision,  it's like Marvel/Star Wars type shows of similar duration, you're just getting into it and it's done and you're left feeling short-changed, imho of course!
we don't want knight of the 7 kingdoms We want house of the dragon 3 and game of thrones seasons 7 and 8 REMAKED and the snyder verse
All the love, from scotland
Brooo this show is gonna be fireeee if they do it right
ea posted up wit the shank😂
Excited!!
WTH 30 min long episodes 😫
Still knee deep in the Long Night, 🤦‍♂️like RR said, “it’s on the way”  well thank you Charlie, I’ll be here just waiting.
another advantage to a single title card is a few more seconds or minutes that the actual show can use.
I love A Knight's Tale.
Looking forward to this. Hopefully they keep filming and keep them coming . Any word of any of the other prequal shows?
Great, another show they won’t finish or will just fuck up 😂😂😂
Thanks Charlie
NYC one love. Thank you for the breakdown
Im not going to hold my breath waiting on George R. R. Martin finishing anything no matter what he says.  fingers crossed there will be some characters worth rooting for.
Been staring at that picture looking for any clues to this season
Love your videos...  Much love from Tanzania
Is ma man Scotch/Irish?!
I can’t wait!!!💯✊🏾😮‍💨 I’m tired of waiting 😭
Sometime I think Charlie you never Leav your Home man lol, do you ever take a break man.. Im not complaining dude , i love the videos
Respectfully I have no interest in this but I got to stop by and show my favorite YouTuber some support ❤❤
Thank you Charlie.
I feel like we have been waiting for the 7 kingdoms for 7 years...😵‍💫
Can’t waittttttt
lets goo, C! I'm pumped for more GoT content
Can’t wait! ⚔️
