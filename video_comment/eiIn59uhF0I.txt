Hata vile anaongea, ni uoga... scammer...
busy? with my money! nkt
Jamaa amemake 4.8 billion Leo bana
Mtu anafika 150m in 2 months but credit inakatika 😂😂😂
Those guys are busy faking to have money 😂 little did they know money always change someone's face and looks like a millionaire 😂but hawa wanajidai wako na pesa yet sura ni kama ngozi ya chura😂
If you know the meaning of AMLT act you can easily detect lies in this interview but wacha watu wadanganywe... Sisi tunajua mambo na pesa huezi sengenya pesa mbele yetu
I hope this guy is not worshiping the Same God I'm worshiping @Kisii man
Kenyan Prince is a genius
Stupid ally 😂😂😂kenyan price amekubebea akili
In whatever you do be the best
I’m here after watching YY comedy 🤣🤣
This guy is spitting on Ali's face and telling him it's raining 😂😂😂
Watchdog behave kama msee ako matured
Laeve God out of it. Scammer, mwizi. Bomboclat
if it seems too good to be true, it probably isn’t true. The Golden Rule.
Huyu the so called TWD, ako na information, ako na evidence ya witnesses,  ako na contacts za watu wamekua affected  na scamming mbona asiwaadvice watake action  ya kureport kwa DCI then give information and show detailed evidence and the so called scammers waekwe behind the bars in a lawful way. It actualky makes sense when you know who is a scammer and you know people who have suffered from his scamming thing and you're walking around talking like the so called scmmer KP . Bro take action stop yapping,  so TWD just yapps no action taken.  Kufunzwa adapu is when someone making kenyans suffer is in jail not calling them to platforms with no solid evidence and yap.  Why use that to clout chase, why use a platform to humiliate others and uplift yourself.  If it's true that TWD is telling the truth then it's high time to stop yapping and take action. Mi kwanza nilioshwa niko na kesi already with another forex scammer
Huyu ni gaidi  DCI wanafaa wake washamfikia🫴🫴😂
True people do make money in forex and others they have made it their career but even the best of them all can only make at most 5% of their total equity on a consistency bases either his a gambler or a scammer but definitely not a trader💯 a true trader knows about compounding and respects risk management in every trade that is taken no matter how right they maybe.
There is no quick rich with no prove
huyu jamaa anaishiwa na airtime na anasema ako na millions. millionnares use post pay
Ama ni forex ya juja
something here doesn't add up....  3:00 and 3:28  got you!!
Scammer! There's nothing like full-margin trader, you'd lose your account very fast
kijana millionaire hana airtime 😅 millionaire anatumia prepaid lol
I like the auditor at the same time kenyan prince is right the people scammed should bring the evidence we seee not hear....
Na huyu truth watchdog ni bonoko walahi
Hiyo call ya njonjo inaonyesha Kenyan Prince anadanganya
Ali amemguza soft spot na stori ya Kerubo😂...you can see the change in facial expressions
Kenyans love scammers, murderers,thieves,whores and quick money.
One thing I know, pesa haitaki kelele. People who genuinely make honest money rarely show off on social media
truth watchdog ni mzee amezeeka na hana shiet ya kudo? noa years down the line anataka kusema nini after prince amejaza parking sai
One this i loved from this show ...you cant scam 10 -20 people  in kenya and survive
Presenter Ali this man has impacted many souls as he is saying
Kwani ulikosa mtu wakutuletea kwa interview aki presenter...
Buh its possible to make any amount in forex❤
Psychologically it is a lie he has something in hidden
Pesa haipendi kelele, that's what i know
How does he pay his taxes
Mbona KP ameparara mikono ivo
What a waste of time ✍️ interviewing that idiot
This young man needs to give his life to Jesus Christ he will sweep his generation to Jesus Christ Kingdom
Kenyan prince, is a go getter. Proud of you mahn
Kasongo is everywhere
whatever yall say hata akisota asha live life wengi hamtawai!!! thats a fact
hakuna kitu kama forex trending
This boy is a scammer
Scammer
Huyu kijana anacheza
He has said he is and IB. An introducing broker works for benefit of the broker. You can't rely on an IB you will lose money.
Watching  from the UK. THERE   IS NO WAY YOU CAN WITHDTAW THAT AMOUNT IN ONE WEEK. SWALI NI HOW MUCH HAD YOU INVESTED IN FOREX.?  I  WAS IN FOREX HERE IN YOU K INVESTING IN POUNDS BUT  NO WAY  WE COULD MAKE SUCH AMOUNT.   LASTLY  BE CAREFUL  ALOT OF PEOPLE  HAVE ENDED UP LOOSING  INVESTIGATE THIS TRADER POLENI SANA
The boy is smart...uses the strategy of annoying the interviewer so they dont continue with the interview He failed on presenter Ali
Ukiwa na pesa pple will always hate
I'd never prove to nobody my money nah
Haka Kamwizi soon katashuka tu from that high stool.
I can be your boyfriend, give me money 😂😂
From my observation, huyu kijana wanamtandao kubwa sana, they have an organization, this big cars being flaunted are just for pr, so they can get innocent Kenya
Huyu ni jambazi wa mtandaoni, even from how he controls, blimks eyes he a thief
The Lord protect you prince,,,from all witches wenye wivu ni wengi,,stand strong you blessed
This guy is a comedian...🤣🤣
A real scammer..This dude is not a trader😂😂
😂 😂 😂 Huyu mjamaa nilifungisha ata account yake ya equity sometime back
in kenya interviewers are not huppy with young succesfull traders .truth watchdog is not police or dci .so when you say we have many cases in truth watchdog viedeos .wacheni wivu
His body language is a game give away... Theoretically what he says works but he is obviously ignorant of the anti money laundering laws. The boy is a pure liar. Simple
ata watchdog akona maneno\
like i like this guy he is so real
Smart boy he scored an A
I want to be a scammer kwani iko nn watu wanaongea vibaya sababu ya njaa
Money is good,,money is a reward after solving someones  problem
Why is Ali looking more healthy than the forex millionaire😢😢😢
Ali, tell that mad man you are interviewing that "A" students don't even say their grades. They are always very quiet. This dude hata labda hakufanya KCSE.
Eti 21 kwani azeekagi
Scammer ..nashangaa mkisii ataniscam aje
Fool ...unadanganya watu ...fala ungekua ushapatika na kra
As much as yáll call this guy a scammer,he sounds genuine to me.if i make money like him i wouldnt even have time to be interviewed trying to explain myself.
Online forex trading, physical forex bureau, Usdt, Binance......from where to where?😢
Multimillionaire hana airtime 😂😂😂😂😂
For you to be a scammer you have to be very smart. Sasa sijui mnaconplain nini. Kuleni tu shida zenu polepole. Na ukikaa vibaya unaoga.
Bro its possible forex, and stock market is full of money. And this money is just papers being printed by banks. Change your mindset towards money and you will be like Kenyan prince.  This thing is real. But you need skills to make money in forex and it take time.
How much is a damage😂😂😂
Yani millionaire anavalia mbota ya soo nne?
Nimekwama hapo kwa i can't ask the chokora why they are in town or street....wacha nijifunze kunyamaza
lol sihakikishi watu
Mimi ni fundi wa stima and i think im rich .

Let people work hard
Wisdom
Kenyan prince to deputize wajackoiya as president we take this nation to greater heights
For those saying tuache machungu it's because it hasn't happened to you. Yes we want shortcuts due to umaskini. Don't blame us for wanting a better life and falling for the forex dream. Lakini let me tell you 😂 once my so called forex mentor ananipigia nimkopeshe 200/= . haha that's when I threw in the towel. 😂😂 Sai I avoid then like a plague. wash wash , forex, scams. It's not worth it. Wacha nikue 25 not yet figured out my life. Pressure Niko nayo natumia kupika tu.
Con
@ 30:34 did i hear a low credit alert on a millionaire's phone! Sorry, one of the millionaire's phones!!.... There are two things that don't go together. Flaunting money and at the same time your image portraying poverty.
6M na hana airtime surely...
thruthwatchdoy n real uyu princes n scammer... how can you not be able to prove what you say... how can you withdraw money to buy a car??????????????
Huyu kijana hadi mkono imeparara kama mtu hajawai ona lotion.

Yani kskofia ka 100 ,watch ya 200 na t-shirt 450 na mikono za kuparara and the guy claim to be a millionaire😂😂😂😂😂. We know Millionaires people like Elon Musk , Billgates, Mark Zuckerbarg no one has to tell you they are rich. Kama kuna mtu anegongwa na huyu msee kwani hajui kusoma hata BODY LANGUAGE???
Kuna waongo lakini haka kajamaa kamezidi 😊😊😊😊😊 eti it is very possible to withdraw 50 million kwa bank?? In a single day?? Hata USA huwezi kufanya transaction  kama hiyo

This is a scammer
Makindi sana😢😢😢😢😢
A millionaire going shot on airtime just a munite after a call ,duuuu kenyans😂😂😂
Rich people even are silence so to the boy is pride tu, for him that is kiburi

In Obinna show he said he withdrew KSH. 24M hapa anasema he withdrew KSH 27M

This guy is smart headwise
It is so unfortunate that our young ones are looking to this unguided youth for advice, not knowing that the one who owns everything and everyone says that "pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall" Proverbs 16:18-20. Pick what you can but be wise to spit out what you must.
We should not highlight such bad characters like from this boy
This boy is a very hot scammer...but
Hduzdjsurjikeisks 😅
Huyu kijana ana kiburi mingi. Your time is coming. Endelea na kiburi lakini hujui wale umedanganya wakuombea nini, nasma tu😢

Kerubo? What a coincidence when it comes to names! Kerubo almost sounds like Karabo (Mokoena) a south African beauty queen who was murdered by her boyfriend who was also known as Sandille Mantsoe.. AN EXPERT ONLINE FOREX TRADER AND TRAINNER .. Sandille ended in prison (32 years for murder) and ended up being raped to death! What a tragic end to young lives..! another coincidence .. Sandille almost looks like this freak .. lmao! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl_h4UV1ej8  ..!
Dogo anasema alikuwa na milioni 27 kwenye gari? UUUWIII ..! Aisee ajiangalie wenye nguvu hapo Nairobi bana! Wenyewe wanaweza wakazitaka hizo hela zao!
Wow, he has openly admitted to scamming people. And you'll still give him money. Kenyans 🤦
Skuizi forex ndio polite name ya rende inafanya wash wash

Huyu kenyan wa Cindy ni mjinga yani anadharau watu sana hiki kitoto mcheeeeew 🚮🚮
so people give him money thinking they will become profitable traders.  it will end  in regret
People with money are not this Thin, Stupid and Ignorant.
Somebody with Serious Money, Don't Post on Social Media.
Body language sells him out
Kiburi joh, watu wakona pesa hawanaga kiburi
Huyu jamaaa ni muogo, ata hio saa amevaa ni zile za 150
This guy is funny.. Hata hajui yenye anasema
Call him a scammer ,,he's living his life ,,,kama uko broke vumilia mpaka ujanjaruke
He can't even proof how he makes his money.. Hana hata Airtime Alafu Njonjo anakata simu wakati ameulizwa swali ngumu. Hakujua watchdog ako live 😂😂😂😂 the biggest Scummer we have right now. He's living a fake life, huyu

A real scammer
fake tuonyeshe withdrawal
Why do you bring this thing on show
ni scammer lakini ni kasmart kimpago pia 😂😂😂
Wa wa wa wa waah this prince........ Does anyone know a school where they teach about pride?
Gaka nî kagui
But forex is real, people are making some money from it, try it
There’s no way this guy made ksh 27m in such an easy way  He doesn’t even look like a cryptocurrency guru  If he was making so much money from trading why would he train people who would be wasting his time instead of investing his time on his own business  Scammers be careful  KARMA is a BITCH
Njonjo hanging up is a clear prove that they are faking it! Amepatikanwa.
Torch 😅
He is a liar,he told Obina that he had withdrawn 24m
27 M and still he wears like a guy working at a local  pub as a waiter.Bruh hadi mafuta tu 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
does forex work in Kenya or just a cave for scammers to hide their identity?😮😮
Binance ni ya crypto currency .Unatoaaje pesa kwa forex account unaeka kwa binance acha ujinga😂
This guy is smart and arrogant at the same time😅
Everything about this guys screams scam...
Uyu msee alisema ali wai scam mtu kwa interview na obina lakini wakenya ni nani
The audacity man😂😂😂
This kid is a mess.
The louder the woofer,the poorer the owner.
This is an interview that really made me Respect Presenter ALI🙌🙌
meaning hes not 20 as he claims 😂😂😂
meaning hes not 20 as he claims 😂😂😂
I love this guy
Amekonda nini sasa?
I'm a trader I'm a learned professional trader truly speaking you can't withdraw 27m within a day actually 27m means he used lot size 100 maybe,, brokers contribute to this withdrawals and deposits,, forex has money but 95% of traders loose,, somebody who makes 27m must be crazy rich in his account,, you can take 6 months to grow an account but you cant 10:40 10
KENYAN PRINCE has ran out of airtime! I thought millionaires subscribe to postpaid plan. What an embarrassment on live video!
Guy hakuna kitu legit hapa all is scamming
You have made this guy to be trending alot.I don't know this guy and if indeed is scamming people remember the three who were found in the forest not long ago.
This guy already escaped the matrix
You undersand eee.thats what am hearing from kp
In my opinion this person is a scammer and he is under a bigmans shadow/protection
Huyu kijana atajuta maisha yake yote kiibia mtu kula jasho lisilo lake
You are in danger
Scamers my friend lost 300k to these brats
Hahahaha
He's always on the run 😂😂
Shameless man🚮🚮
Jamaa ni kama ako na pesa kutoka kwa majini.. huyu ni wazimu tu,
Presenter Ali, my  problem is with you.  your patience to deal with this idiot is on another level.
" si PIA wewe uibe , UNIFANANE " ukilemewa ujiue "wueh mimi nimeenda kukula smocha🗝️🗝️⚠️
The guy is Kenya's biggest scammer and he's a proud scammer 😂😂
Ey ey KRA...nanii...KRA muko wapi buana 😂😂😂😂
I don't know him but in forex with a big account and you know how to trade,you can make any money,I agree.  But why do people want him to confirm?So what after confirming? This is entitlement.Ati,confirm....  But also people are not patient,you give him money today and then you are on his phone everytime.He will respond to you like a scammer. Don't give out your money jifanyie so that he will not scam you if you think he is a scammer. People tempt others so much.
Ebu tuconfirmie ya denny c
Kijana mm ukinikula 200k nakupiga risasi walai 😅
Boy apige mboka bora aliacha kuibia watu
Muwache wivu kijana ako na pesa roho safi
Bottom line is Kenyans have alot of money to waste... The question is how can you trick/lure them to give you the millu....pastors have managed to do so now the likes of Kenyan prince have managed it As Kenyans in short sisi ni mafala
Unajichanganya tu
15:55 this guy really said GOD told him to scam 😄
huyu kajamaa kwanza ,,naskianga kameniboo sana ,,,,,alafu anasema ati akisota tumchangie,,,mtu anaeza fanya 100million in months anasota aje,,,,,,,stupid guy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love his facial expressions when ali was calling truth watchdog

This boy is so stupid scammer না sai ako na mafeelings baada ya kumulikwa😊
May be haujawindwa na wenye uliwascam,because God anakupa a chance ili you repent
Siku za mwizi ni arobaini,he is not the first person to be a scammer,so masiku ni chache tu ya kukaa duniani,then aende penye wengi wameenda.bt bro,just humble yourself you are still young and he should be sensible.
PA umepotea sana kaka,kawaida kazi yako ni safi
This man is not trustworthy............from oga obinas and your interview,,,,,,,that for a new car is lie,,,from obinas show he bought for his friend....here he was buying her car....[ call him her because she is acting like a stupid she goat......misleader.
Strategy innit🤣🤣🤣this boy is smart
Ali is very smart and I like his approach. He's trying to call this little boy a "scumbag" Without having to say it. Anataka ajikarange na maneno yake.
Young scammer your days are numbered
He scored A plain 😂😂😂
Huyu jamaa ni nn inafanya asishikwe na CID kenya ama CIA ya usa huyu jamaa ni international stupid scammer 😅😅Kuna kitu na miss kuelewa kukosa kushikwa kwake
Prince hatujasahu uliiita yesu a nigga kwa interview na tumbili and yet unasema u fear God
Si huyu kijana apigwe tu radi,,why is it that this people go unpunished ...sometimes dunia ni unfair
Real forex traders are quiet,hatukatai he is making money just say u do forex in the line of scanning,ur a thief in forex

Proving a forex transaction is so secure
I real scammer
When I was in class I used to score good grades but I never struggled to prove to people that i was clever, the guy is just trying to prove people that he has money yet he doesn't bure kabisa very poor English with grammatical errors yet he said scored A
Now I see why nature often gives people time and space to grow older and more mature before allowing them to access riches. Imagine thousands of 21-year-old multi-millionaires driving big machines on our roads  😱😱😱😱😱
Kenya prince toka kenya for your safety.... Go other countries do your underwater or elsewhere 😢😢😢😢
Watchdog is really ignorant. He is bitter too . I feel bad for people who follow and heed to him
The boy is honest
Huyo ni yule Billionaire wa Syokau?
You can't scam me😅

Phew amesema over 25 so i still have time to save myself. 26 years and above, mmeskia vile mkubwa amesema.

Young and foolish. This lad has no brains at all.  For me, I'd rather stay broke till I become mature enough to handle finances and wealth. He barely know to express himself respectively.

Uyu msee interview ya obina alisema alikuwa na 24m by then akionyeshana 6m, tena leo anasema alikuwa na 26m which is which?
People are funny outside here 😂😂
Prisenter Ali looks richer than him
Presenter Ali to the world, in Shaa Allah 😢🎉❤
In oga Obinna show, he said he tried to convince kerubo by buying him a new Mazda..then, here he says he says something different 😂😂
Huyu mwanaume ety mother fuckers in the comments section..???umbwa.....ATI am only 21 just to look at him looking like a 60 old man idiot....
😂😂I like this guy. Whether you like it or not. This guy is way better than most of you hating. Komo komo baka Engori
This looks, smells and sounds like a SCAM, lakini we know how Kenyans crave easy money. Ukisikia forex na Binance, etc., kimbia.
Exactly, a broker agent......anapromote broker, he is in the broker's payroll. Trust this guy at your own risk
Akuje atrade live alaaa........forex has got money but not from 6million to 50m in a short time.. ....nevaaaaaa
Kijanaa you are very smart
i like the way PA controls the temper😂😂....According to my knowledge... the work of a beuro is it typically for those people who travel internatinally or to withdraw money from a broker?...research🙄🤔... Also saying that the one who lost 200k to add him 800k..... someones money?...its very heartless. i  watched that live its in twd's youtube..... That guy spoke out of his heart he didnt mention the amount anouncing  that it was very painfull😢... sorry to that guy🙏🏻
As a psychologist i tried to make some sense from both sides... but i was not happy when the interveiwee directly called the  interviewer ignorant...again proving to the interveiwer doesnt by any chance...raise any insecurities but the expression of saying 27m didnt speak some sense.. the way he diffended it🇦🇱.... Ali  must have gone through a psychology class when he uses that  word noway😅... only a few can get what he was finding out.... i havent leaned on any side or insaulted anyone but just facts i dont know  anybody there😊 iam really waitng for that friday... 😅 kindly post the whole video💯..... one person will go down😂
What is burukenga in English 😆
He is a scammer coz even me I was scammed and the scammed has never refused  to speak and talk to people yet he is a great scammer
Maisha ya huyu ni fupi
This fucking young fucker is a fucking the bes example of a liar and  an actor. He proved to be a puppet. Kudos presenter Ali....
This boy is poorest. Hata credit hana!
Most of you fools don't actually know it but you can make 6 million in one day on forex but it's good that you don't believe it that way KRA wasitukujie.
He thinks he's that smart enough stop being paranoid Kenyan Prince I bet you barely have the forex knowledge
Wivu itawauwa😂😂

Huyu akiendelea hivi mtaskia story na "in cctv provided by the apartment..."
Kwani anakopa credo ya 5bob kila mara. Tajiri hu-subscribe monthly airtime. Aibu ndogo-ndogo. Sina mali hivyo lakini hakuna hata siku utasikia phone yangu ikitoa alart ya airtime inaisha, inshaallah🙏
The guy doesn’t look monied coz guys who make such kind of cash don’t even want guys to know. This one is looking for validation and doesn’t look like the cash he is talking about even from his dressing 😅😅😅😅😅

Wait 27 million what???? guys get me this guy i promise to bring u the mwakenya of making this mulla😂😂😂😂
Placenta Ali gossip king doing a great job boy 😂😂
99% of these FX traders are scammers, If you know what it means to be a profitable trader; the discipline, humbleness and all the positive personal traits that you have to approach the markets with then you can tell that this guy is no where near being profitable, making 6M, assuming with a 2% risk means that you got to have almost 50M balance....that guy is a scammer...99% of Kenyan FX traders are scammers
Haendi mbali na hyo kiburi yake, anajifanya Mike sonko na hana ata bodyguard!!! Achunge mwelekeo wake... whether he has money or not he should take precautions....
Mtu anaiba
Why can he just share the proves this guy is ever kidding us
11:20 -11:40 says it all😂
This guy is a scammer, period.
Let him be
Characteristics of a guy who isn't saying the truth the body language also always throwing numbers after every question i.e 20million 30g's and the likes
Sijawai penda Ali but kwa hii interview eeeiii heeee alitoanisha huyu mkisii vibaya sana
He is a master of double speak.. total BS
You withdraw 27m cash to pay for your new car?😂😂😂😂where on earth
Millionaire ana credit 😂🤣😂
What happened in Friday's meeting, am looking for that video sioni
Ali: You withdrew 27M? Ulitoa wapi 27M? Ni Forex? Na ulikuchukua muda upi? Silly Him: Actually haijanichukua long, in a Month I mada the whole amount... Bla bla bla.... Ali: How much right now are you making from Forex? Dumb him : Depends with the day, am not really pushing for money right now, am pushing for having fun out here, but I can make like 2k-5k.. Stoned me: 😵‍💫 is it ksh or USD?? Niqqa snitching on himself...
Huyu ni Scammer anajifunza.
Is he in good health 😮😮?
I like this young wise man.
Idiot
Huyu na mafuta hajipaki.....ako na mirrions kweli?
He is full of fear he looks problem
Huyu ni Fala wa kawaida Pesa kidogo imekujaza kiburi ...utapatana na wanaume wakufundishe kusmile kijana kuwa mpole
This small boy doesn't even look like 200k
Millionaire na credit inakata within 2min
Small boy his days are numbered
HONESTLY FROM THE LOOKS YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE WHO IS MAKING MILLIONS & SOMEONE WHO IS MAKING SHILLINGS!!! THIS GUY IS JUST A SCAMMER & A THIEF IN THE NAME OF FOREX! TRUTHWATCHDOG WAANIKE KABISAA TUSAFISHE HIZI MITAA 👊
Presenter Ali how comes only teachers make it than student's I think student's become more successful than teachers this guy's are scarmers
Kredo pekee hana😂
Comment section: 90% are haters

angalia ngozi yake vile imekauka na anasema ati he is rich...
Huyu fala haezikuwa na doh, mtu akicheka meno yote inatoka nje. Ako njaa shiiet

Na vile unakaa njaa😂😂
Hii nongwe na ruto same wozaap mauongo tu

Wakisii na scam 😢😢😢
Am waking up from my comfort zone..bruh 😴
Ukiwa na pesa hununui airtime!unalipia postpaid....hii story ya Kenyan Prince doesn't add up 😮
This Kenyan prince is true talent in manipulation😂. He is a pathological liar,smooth talker and will empty your pockets in a record one hr if you give time to talk!What a waste of brains!He could have curved a bright future in a different way.He has chosen the flashy,extravagant lifestyle at the expense of other Kenyans.I hope Presenter Ali ulimpa advice tafadhali.The kiburi yawaaa!
Scammers ni kawaida...... Kenyans are most stupid people to be scammed until they will wake up tutaoshwa sana
Who noticed Malema's accent in this interview😂
We uyu anafa kuwa jela😢
Hi ni kijana nimikora😂😂
Huyu kijana hata sijui, he is a very good influencer, the most talked about sells😅😅bro whatever you're doing keep doing

This hungry guy is a foolish scammer 😂😂😂very broke 😮
This guy is really faking and earning from scamming
Truthwatchdog tells us the truth
Ananunua airtime ya mbao
😂😂😂 millionaires hawavaangi ivo ata kwanza...but anyway fake it till you make it guys
Hapo 22 min, haki unatuambia na hii 30 yangu tujiuwe na umekuwa na doh juu ya kuscam watu.
This guy is a big big  scammer,
'I can approve to you after the interview but not the people' the first red flag
You're doomed....
Huyu Ali anakuanga kiherehere
I followed this interview. If you look keenly about this boy is he having the money he has. This is a conman with no such money.
ANABURRRRNN
Hadi hana credo!
It’s not bad when a young man tries to find greener pastures.
presenter Ali is very good at this
If God "puts" 27M under my name, the best I can do is to build and register a very nice private school. Anyway I'm just trying make fun of the story. Making 27M in a month is one hundred million question to ask yourself where the rain is beating you😂😂😂 ju weee!!!!!
This scammer is crazy
Mwinzi n mwinzi hata umushike akiwa na hicho k2 ameiba bado hatakataa
Hiki kijana ni kikora, even on his statement and on is eye could tell while responding to question, Beware!!!!!
When it comes to truth watchdog , inamuuma,anaanza matusi, meaning its the truth he is a scam
The problem people complain alot sasa mtu hatamake pesa kwa amani
This guy is a complete scammer. You can see the body language. Doing nothing, making millions from peoples sweat.
A is always for Amazing 🥰😍
I'm waiting  for Friday fire
👊👊👊👊kabisaa .. grind... prince
nani aoni uyo msee ako na 45kg
Judgement day coming soon 😢
Tunapea 2 years....we will be back
Huyu jamaa ameita presenter Ali fala ivo tu na Ali aniulizii 😂😂😂
This guy is not a FX trader, there is nothing like security details on a forex trading platform. Showing your platform history with successful trades, how much you funded or what you have withdrawn  is as simple as showing your mpesa statement. Its true you can make such amount in forex but this boy is not a trader.
I'm not rulling out the boy is a scammer thing. But the guy said a very critical point here.. you give him money and he teaches you, probably he suggests you a  broker(XM) coz he's IB. What makes him a scammer if you deposited and blow the account by yourself?
What a personality! I pity your attitude man.
Njonjo is turning out to be a scam
Nimekwama apo kwa A plain
Haonyeshe trading history
this guy is earning more than riggy G🤣🤣
I love this guy nigga is making alot of money we lia tu hapo
Champe omosa .you can never win a case against my boy.trust you me
Kenyan Prince ametetemeka,venye simu ya truth imeingia check his heart beat rate
East west.....Kenyan prince is a son of king .....he is a true definition of smart success
This is a stupid person
Kijana apewe makofi mazito are.boot
The kind of arrogance😂😂 huyu kijana ako nayo huyu ni mwizi
The forex business in Kenya huwa so funny😂😂
Why is everyone complaining, 😂 Forex is hard , the few that makes it will always be envied . 2 millions a day is very possible with funded accounts. And nothing is free , If I make it I will always charge for my service . Kenyan prince 🤴 keep it up man .
Kenyan prince is a smart guy...
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅No brains 🧠🧠 at all
34:54 alis reactions 😂😂😂...ameboeka na yeye
Huyu ni scammer hatari
It's possible to make even 100millions aday and you are comfortable with like 5000 a day 🤷🤷🤷. Scam allert!!!!!
7:46 😂😂😂,,,Ali is so bold😂😂
Huyu nae ni bazuuu😂
Tell this young man to calm down. Real traders don't speak and act like he does. Let him stop tarnishing our names as traders.
Sasa multi millionaire hana ata credo ya phone 😂😂😂😂
Not rich at 25 do that thig
I know what ur talking bro i deal with dollar
😂😂😂😂😂😅😅 awache kutupima ..😂😂😅utakua rada ya DCI mpaka uskie raha 😅28 what 😂😂😂😅. Chocha walai 😅
Danganya toto wewe huna kitu😂😅
I love his eloquence
The only consistent thing with this man is that he was a scammer and he is a trader.. The rest are incoherent.
Huyu ni kijana mjinga akipotea hivi karibuni  hii kiburi msilaumu kuibia watu si fity.
Mi sijui ata huyu ni nani na mbona watu wanamchukia..na hata sijali but ni mtrue..ka kijana Ako na pesa acha aenjoy..😂😂😂😂😂😂
This boy is smart up stairs..😂 Wacheni kijana atese,it is his time

Wapi makofi ya the one and only presenter Ali❤
Cap 300/-,T-shirt 1000/-,Trouser 1000/-,shoes 1500,Watch 500, and you are here telling people how u make 2.5M per day😂😂😂
Bulshit ..
Ali to the world❤🎉😂
Idiot bwoy says: I made 27 million Ali: Prove it Idiot Bwoy: You are ignorant Ali: How come? Idiot Bwoy: You are putting me on blast The rest of us: Watu si wajinga
So you sit here and think you have money? Give that guy your investor password watu waone kama ni ukweli wewe ni trader ama ni scammer.
Ata kama prince is a scammer, he brilliant for his age. If scamming brings you money without having to harm someone physically, do it. Wakenya wengine muache bitterness ju ya umaskini.
KENYAN PRINCE KEEP WINNING
😂😂😂😂
Hii yenye inakataa credit😂😂
This young Man is smart and promising....hii Biashara ya forex itamumess wallai

Friday tunangoja.Ali hakuna kitu kama internal transfer by IB.IB ni marketer na hata brokers hawawajui.... asibebe watu ujinga... But with money you have options is true..arrogant but true
How do you say it's a lie!! people make 100m per day from forex.but what am pretty sure is anamake hiyo pesa but not from his capital probably from funded accounts.with funded accounts you can make so much millions per day .so Mimi am on his side
And the way she looks malnourished. This young man is going down very fast, soooooon.
The guy talk shits and he is ascammer.
Story changes from one interview to another
Imgn having 6million but 200k za mwenzake hawezi rudisha
We all know.delila betrayed samson my advice to content creator look for kerubo she knows more about this dude
Shida ya waafrika ni hawaeziamini uko na pesa because you most likely have more than them
My brother ali eastleigh tumekukubali your the best welcome inshallah.❤

Aha,,this kèhè thinks people are stupid,,which bank allows withdrawal of 27 mill within a day without questioning?? And 2 hutu tujinga ndio watafanya watu wa forex waanze kupigwa tax coz of this fake flaunting
D.C.I should ARREST huyu wash wash, illuminate

Just wow,presenter Ali to the world 🌎
This guy is creating WhatsApp group and selling abroad, he can make more than 5 million a day.
He's realy contradicting himself bana🥲
Kijana hana mafuta😂😂😂😂
Kenyan Prince WENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA Showing 6M cash! Yet he is now talking about 'HE HAS TO CONSIDER HIS SECURITY'.   I find it very very IGNORANT/UNCOUTH/ARROGANT for him to do such a thing & also FLAUNTING HIS CARS ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA!  This kind of Arrogance is VERY VILE/DISGUSTING! No RESPECT FOR HIMSELF/FAMILY/ or even his own DIGNITY.  However, I have to say that after Googling whether it is WORTHY TO TAKE COURSES in Forex Trading, I learnt that: IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME TO LEARN IT - YOU CAN DO IT.   THERE IS FREE INFO ON HOW TO TRADE FOREX ETC ONLINE. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAY FOR COURSES.  I Say to Kenyan Prince - STOP SHOWING OFF & YOU ARE ENDANGERING YOUR SECURITY YOURSELF!
And it's evident what @TWD01 said.....they sell you signals and scum you via the classes
Nani ame notice credit ya youngest millionare imeisha live kwa camera,
Professional lier,,your talking about security just to show us your trading history,,but you can flaunt 6M without minding security.
DCI
This forex shit is a lie i was scammed by one of these f@ckers😅😅
What is 200k you deny paying someone and yet you made 27m per day?
Ali weh uliamua 😂that was a trap
utapigwa risasi kijana
The day government decide enough is enough mtajua...watch latest DW documentary about so forex facilitators
Mtu akona all those millions Hana credit 😂😂
Truthwatchdog all the way. Kenya prince Ni scammer
Notes don't make noise coins does hata banks huwezi sikia sikipiga kelele zimetulia pride is the down fall of a man remain humble no matter how far you get
If one torch is gone it costs 300k. 😂😂Wtf

Bro you will be jailed
Wololo .... billionaire anatumia prepaid 😂
Ati how many million in a day 😂😂? Kwani hii forex mimi nafanya ni gani c mnipee link ya app origii 😂😂,,,,,,,,,,,, this stupid man thinks everyone is a kid
Kazi safi Ali ❤
I would candidly caution this young man! Yes, maybe he is finding a way in to the game but he is losing it. The Internet doesn't embrace the negative but rather throws it to the mud! Your desire to gain wealth is notable and commendable. But I'll advice you to take a turn and do the right thing. It's evident whatever you're calling forex is far away from getting you the money you're flaunting!! Yes, you'll trend but what will sustain you as you trend? Go back and work your ass-off. Take time to learn and you'll earn. Or else you'll sacrifice your soul by your mouth.😢😢 Bye Kenyan Prince.
I believe this guy forex is real this guy can make that amount
What is the real name of this guy?
Watch dog yeye anajuaje kila MTU mmmh 😳
This guy karma will fuck him really good
𝘿𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙖 𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙞𝙚😅😅😅
I believe truth watchdog..😊
10:59
Best interview ever. I always watch this young man with other interviewers but presenter Ali… your interview is remarkable. I should also applaud this young man for his courageous guts. I mean his one to hate but at the same time you just can’t help but watch as he answers questions so swiftly 😅😅
hakuna mtu huulizwa kuhusu pesa legit anajam
A CLOWN enjoying the camera
mtu akona 6 million anakosa aje credit😂😂
Nyinyi wakenya mnakuanga funny sana, mkiona mtu anamake it in life mnaanza kumfight. Bure kabisaa nyinyi
Sijui shinda ya wakenya ni gani ..wivu ndio wamejaza...ni watu wangapi tunawaona wanafanya trending sio wakenya na wameomoka.watch dog atafute pesa ..he should heal he is so bitter .go go kijana omoka ata ukiwa maskini bado wataongea..wengine mumejaza bitterness huku kwa comments sections.nkt
Uyu siku moja atapeleka hii kiburi kwa mtu amepata pesa through tough tides atakula risasi ya matako, so rude to be genuine
Arimis ni 40 bob
Even if you are not a psychologist first sight and I got the answer.
Lies you can't withdraw 6million per day. Uwongoo mtupuu. This guy is ignorant.  Kenyan bank you withdraw 999000.
Funny people
TWD is bitter
At 21 now, the other day you said you're 29 years. What a fucked young life. Look for life man
Why is he struggling to justify? Give us proof that you're not a SCAMMER?
Forex trading is real, and it involves buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market. However, it also carries risks, and losses are possible. It's crucial to educate yourself, practice with a demo account, and only invest what you can afford to lose.
This guy is a scammer. He looks likes he is going through depression.
Jealous watchdog we wait for Friday
This is an ass. He's a big scammer who knows no shit in trade
Huyu na hii arrogance yote hatamaliza next Yr
Scammers never prove what they do to the public 🥺🥺
😂😂 good job ali
He is a scamner body language showing
Wanike wote wezi na kanajifanya eti kanashika pesa na kamekonda as if kaenda kufa kesho? Huyu atarogwa kwa sababu ya pesa ya wenyewe kumbafu hii

There is no such thing, from BINANCE to Forex bureau.....ALI kijana anakufunga nappy kabisa.Forex Bureau is for the worldwide currency Exchange only.
He's lying no bank will allow to withdraw that much in a day.
Even Hushpappi was worse than yuo he is paying for what he did ma niggah yuor tym is coming especially now umejianika it's coming bro
This is the best interview ever kudos my former school mate
if he can't wear fancy clothes and fancy watches then he has no money....He his just blaffing around with rentals cars and a fake lifestyle
Problem we have as black color people and our down fall ni kupata hii pesa then you want to show off the money instead off investing quietly. This jamma he better grow up, awache kiburi, think ahead na awache kufloss  hii pesa anadai anaforex. Kuna illuminati forex money pia.
Huyu msee no mwizi kichwa ngumu
Payback tym utafurahia bro, trending thief
""uyo n mwizi""...🤣🤣🤣

That look , Hiyo part ya mwisho ali ameshindwa ata sema nini 😂😂😂 ..  34:57
Presenter Ali c afunzwe forex aache kuzunguka na camera
Pia minadai kukua scammer
This guy is ignorant and should refocus
The kid is an orphan who is doing his all to survive. He loves the fast lane
Still poverty is the enemy. If you are blind kungongwa utagogwa hii Nairobi
Ali amenona tangu aoe waoo
Wacha ujinga kula kwanza😂😂
You can't even buy a car for 2million in cash
Kerubo did the right thing to leave this scammer
We watched him interviewed by Oga Obinna and he candidly spoke of how he gongad people, just listen carefully to that interview. I watched because he was so impressive then he kind of started bragging
Kijana amekua celeb....kutrend kiviusasa....mumeamua kumuutisha interviews back to back
Today I will punish myself for watching this clip to the end.
Soon tutaona huyu na playbill
uyo kijana ata vile ameparara haikai kuwa na pesa
Mwenye alitafuta doo kwa jasho lake hawezi kuwa ka huyu boy mbona huyo jamaa ameulizwa swali na wtchdog na aka hang why??
Guys hizi scripts zenu ziko poa ata kuliko za Hollywood, the guy is very funny,😂😂😂😂
this is the video we were all eager to see. kazi safi presenter Ali
😂😂😂😂 Am not judging but from the look of things, huyu kijana even from the conversation you can notice that all those are lies, watu wafanye kazi, rich people don't explain how wealthy they are, let's be true and be realistic
30:23 the moment amesema ati am live on camera ni signal 😂😂😂 uyu jamaa ni mwizi bana 😂
Go and find a fool
A smart thug
Brother presenter Ali, we need people like you nice interview !This boy will pay for the money he has scammed people.
Thanks Ali for such a great interview. I have followed up other interviews of this young man and never finished them because they butter and cover him up.
Conman conman burukenge
He looks depressed 😔😔
Mpumbavu mweu mkubwa!!!  You content creators should refrain from these scammers nkt!  Where is DCI???  Such goons should be behind the bars not on interview!
A real scamer can not block anyone neither ignores calls,,he or she will continue,,,
why is he always YAWNING? Ni njaaa ama?
Before i thought that this guy was a trader but when he said i make 27 million in a day and used to do a scammer. I realised that this guy he is a dangerous scammer. Coz in Forex market you can't make more than 2million in a day.
If you are taking this to the heart depression might suffocate you.  Talking on behalf of those bitter. The only KISSII in millions at 21💪
The eloquence is great hope this is legit
Apo kwa love ni ukweli,,,watu wakipata pesa wanameet type yao👌
Presenter Ali, ask TruthWatchDog why he is targeting the forex traders that seem vulnerable. Why not subject ALL SOCIAL MEDIA/INFLUENCER forex traders including the likes of Thee Pluto to the same scrutiny? Audit them ALL from the smallest to the biggest WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR so we can know wheat from shaft. Truth watchdog, shoud be fair, stop selective justice. Unless there are those who have paid him to not mention them. Awamezeshe ukweli wote tujue hana chuki na ahongwi.
I painfully watched the entire interview. Whats the obsession with "I bought a new car". Credit imekata
Hiki kinachukulia watu anji,,,uwezi toa that amount in one day,, bullshit
15:15 What a conicendence. He just put himself into 😮😮😮😮 What a F**l!
Ego top notch
Eeeiii😂😂😂27million?? Tena si 24 M
Huyu jamaa kitu ya kwanza he is not smart, hajui hata kudanganya😂😂
uyu kijana ako na uongo..akuna kitu kaama forex beural whaterver😂😂😂unabeba watu ufala unafikiria atujui na hiyo pesa pia aiezi toka ivyo once..tafta kazi uwache uconmanship
This useless boy is a fraud
Good job 👍 Ali
Kenyan prince is truthful,watchdog ni unaskini na upumbavu😂😂
Presenter Ali is such a meticulous and talented interviewer. He has managed to make the guy wilfully accept and that he is a SCAMMER!
This guy is a liar and he thinks he is outsmarting everyone but what he doesnt know is he is putting a target on his back and real criminals will start monitoring him for quick cash grab yet the guy is a such a brokie and doesnt have the money to begin with. He is such an easy target. He thinks flexing an expensive phone is balling , his entire outfit is below 2k man is not balling like that.😂😂
𝘾𝙡𝙤𝙪𝙙 𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙞𝙨 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙡
Uyo kijana ako na kiburi bwana  😂😂😂
Why is the guys belaboring with the explanation.
Present Sir Ali i salute you bro...This guy degree of madness is very high ..
I swear according to me this guy needs to be in prison. It's just a matter of time mtaniambia.
Did Prince just call Presenter Ali ignorant?? Naah broh!!
UONGOOOOOOOOOOO I am a forex trader for 3 years and thats impossible using Kenyan brokers agency. he is a big scam. Let him explain the algorithim he uses for risk management to make that amount he is saying. hawa ni watu wanatumia American VPN details and pose as international brokerage agencies and swindle the money through the wallets. He cant be caught coz he is not using Kenyan VPN details. to trace him is incognito. MKORA
Kenya banks, maximum amount of withdrawal is 1m
this guy keeps contradicting him self mara anasema alicon mtu 200k then akaambia comee anataka kuhire  harrier mara he makes 6m within 2weeks anyway wacha iiendelee
Sasa shida ya huyu watchdog ni nini ju sielewi.
Most of this Forex guru's are just so fake.Sadly people still fall into this scams.
Body language ya Kenyan prince says a lot 😂😂😂😂
Ali is the best alishika balls kijana😂
27m na hii mikono imekauka ivo😂💔
I fear for this guy life.
The figures are not realistic 😂😂😂😂 Let the guy prove by giving out his investors password...
Huyo Watchdog ako na hasira za ujinga, it's about proof of facts, not proof of matusi. Let's hear the truth on Friday.
Kama Kawa kama dawa,,ni truthwatchdog hapa😂😂
Kwani hii pesa haikuoshi? Uko na uongo imeparara kama iyo mikono yako
This guy is smart wadau pesa iko online look at andrew tate 😳 pple signing up in real world 🌎 i need this confidence 👏 pia me to make money uku online
This skinny thing is very arrogant and rude Omg..!!!
Huyu hata hakai pesa😂
😂😂😂😂
unable to judge him but Kenyan's should learn something from this interview.
This boy is a thug
Thus boy is a thief
Jinga wewe 😆
This guy seems stressed ,its just a matter of time kimrambe.
Competent psychologists will notice something about this guy. Sorry guys, not even psychologists, if anyone watches his body language and listens to his 3 recent interviews, one will notice something. I like the interview; the interviewer was determined to get answers  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PRIDE COMES BEFORE A FALL.
Friday we have a date😅😅😅😅
Don't prove anything, nyinyi hua mnaonyesha payslips zenu ???
The tone itself shows indicates fear. His not sire of himself
We ni mwizi mtu wangu saka wera😂
Huyu anakaa njaa
Kijana Chunga Sana.. You're my village mate Acha kukula haramu..🤔🤔🤔 ukiendelea ivi hautaenda mbali.
I dont like judging, my view is that prince is very smart  either way boca ikijipa chapa poverty is bad
Uyu ni mkora...  Also people who work hard for their money never throw it in everyones face like this guy... 😂😂😂 Just look for money the right way and no one will question your sources of wealth
Placenta Alii 😂😂😂😂
STUPID FELLA
Ali its evident uyu kijana n Mwizi ... Hes a scam because everything he talks is full of lies .. bro even the call with Njonjo this dude must have told njonjo BANA WASHO PESA  ZILIKUA ZANGU WAKIPIGA SIMU USINICHOMEE UTAKUNYWA SODA. so njonjo on hearing TWD he panicked and akashindwa ataambia nini TWD .. guys am not spreading hate but WATCH OUT 🙏🙏
young and ignorant. cant stand him at allllll
Huyu hadi akai pesa. Every broker work independently. No organization can come ati ukitaka ku withdraw more money from broker unawaendea. Broker work independently with withdrawal limit . Akuna kitu kama forex bureau of investigation
From which bank?Nonsense
"Eti you cannot be able to carry out forex transactions in the states because of taxes" $2,000 dollars is nothing in the US 😂😂😂 You are the SI unit of b/s**t 🐂 💩
Toa hii mafii hapa
This guy is either lying, stupid, or a thief.
Uongo bana. Broker wako na limit withdrawal. Every broker has withdrawal limit per day .
How is he pronouncing flaunting anaitamka kwa lugha ya mama
It's not really okay to force someone to bring receipts,hata wewe Ali hutakubali to prove to us how you live your life
Huyu msee amesema I should kill myself... Chaai
This guy just dug his own grave the moment alianza yesterday's interviews
This young men has signed himself to millions of Kenyans that everyone is a fool. I have been scammed by another one look n sound like him. His rise n fall of him online .
Before aseme eti 27 million alipe my 20k😢
i like this guy
Huyu jamaa amekonda he's suffering
So you withdrew money from a bank to pay for a car. Because you cannot transact with the bank? Kwani watu hubeba 60 million cash kununua shamba. How old is this fool???
Bro we waabie ata ruto tuna mwitanga mwizi😂😂
Millionaire na ata uwezi buy Arimis ama Nivea For Men uwache kuparara mikono😂😂😂
Mbwa hii usitusi mtu wa kwetu 😂😂😂

Why only kenyan prince...kafuri,pluto states delano,sammy boy etc  they do forex...mbona mnaingilia sanaaaa kenyan prince😢
We are many forex traders in this country, we trade to make daily bread not to prove to anyone forex pays
Huyu jamaa Ali mwambie anunue mafuta bana... Ameparara, na Ako na doo..but anyways, let people leave others live their own lives.. it's his money, what he does is none of my business.. what I know is that, poverty ain't a good thing

Presenter Ali please next time don't waste your precious time with this embicile
His arrogance depicts this guy is a scammer and a thief at the same time. And he has proven that; how can you eat somebody's 200k and rudely prove it
The rise and fall of a kisii young man…will go down on history….i feel like his life might be on danger, too risky with this whole thing
DCI is coming
Presenter Ali amejam,...you can't scam me😅😅😅 I like that😅😅
AT 6.15 - ATI ALI NI IGNORANT?

Tell this guy not to underestimate people's wrath. Also, tell him not to forget the fate of the three scammers who ended up in the forest. He can only do too much to Kenyans na watu si wajinga
