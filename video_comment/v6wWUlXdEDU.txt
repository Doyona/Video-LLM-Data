I was crying😭
I recently fell in love with stray kids and when I first found this song I cried my eyes out. A few days ago my family let our cat go and this song really connected to that. This song makes me feel like I am talking to my cat. RIP JR 2007-2025

Literally crying right now listening to this
Novembro?
This is one of the most emotional songs I've ever heard—the melody, the lyrics, the harmony, Seungmin's emotion, the meaning Bangchan imbued in the lyrics. I can't listen to it without crying, sometimes I feel like I need to sing it at the top of my lungs while I cry
i  just cant stop playing this songgg!!!!!
Wow, like wow. My tears won't stop for this song  Seungmin did an amazing job  Channie I hope you realize how many people you've brought together 🖤

I just want to say thank you stray kids I lost my aunt and grandpa 5 years ago and I was struggling so hard until I found stray kids I still struggle but not as much as before I used to never go to school on the days I miss them and now I put my headphones on and go to school thank you for filling most of the hole in my heart that they took with them
felix thank you so much it’s me Ariel and i’m 10 and you helped me so much felix i cry every day because you helped me i wanted to kill myself until you showed up in my life with your videos and music ik this song that Seungmin is singing isn’t from you but you helped me felix i still want to kms but i also want to be an idol like you you gave me the lesson of to never give up but at the same time i hurt myself by biting my hand because my anxiety like when i’m mad i just smile and hide my pain and one time i was at school and i cried silently and someone came up and i wiped my tears and smiled and pretend i was okay but my heart shattered as i hid my pain. this is why ily because i want to be like you and i want to come see your concert but i never have and never will be and i want to live in korea but my mom is broke just like how im broken and hiding all my pain and felix your the only person who i told about my feelings pls comment on this and tell hyunjin han chan changbin Seungmin bang chan lee know i love them too love you all!!!!😭

I'm crying
If I could change the rhythm of time I'd go back and forth a million times If that's what it takes to keep you right by my side My dearest, I'm sorry   Hurts so deep inside I shouldn't have let you go Why did I say goodbye  Holding your hands yeah we'd never let go Squeeze 'em five times that's our own little code Told you good night but you're spending all-nighters alone Should've never said goodbye I wish I could turn back the time   Can't help but notice you grew up so well It's all I ever wanted but I should've been there The things that you have been through I wanted to protect you I swear My dearest, I'm sorry  Hurts so deep inside I shouldn't have let you go Why did I say goodbye  Holding your hands yeah we'd never let go Squeeze 'em five times that's our own little code Told you good night but you're spending all-nighters alone Should've never said goodbye I wish I could turn back the time    Dear Mum and Dad I'm sorry, I tried To stay the same but to my demise The things around me have broken me up but still I'll always love you
HOW MUCH BEAUTY, WARMTH, KINDNESS, FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS ARE IN SEUNGMIN'S VOICE... HE SINGS LIKE A TRUE ANGEL. YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO HIM. YOU WANT TO ENJOY HIS PURE VOCAL ALWAYS. OUR EXCELLENT VOCALIST SEUNGMIN IS WORTH OUR BIG LOVE, RECOGNITION AND RESPECT.

"GOODBYE" has a beautiful, soulful, soft, warm, and tender sound. ONLY SEUNGMIN COULD SING IT SO WONDERFULLY. HE PUTS ALL HIS FEELINGS, EMOTIONS, PROFESSIONALISM, AND HUGE LOVE FOR MUSIC INTO HIS PERFORMANCE. THANK YOU, MINNIE & BANG CHAN for the BEAUTIFUL SONG.
I'm crying
Fun fact: I became a stay the exact day this came out.
SEUNGMIN'S talent at singing is always getting better, and his voice is getting BEAUTIFUL and BEAUTIFUL day by day!!!
coming back to this because i heard this song just earlier at an restaurant:)
Now I understand the pic at first the both man and woman have dimples just like bangchan And it is trying to show that bangchan's mom and dad had to let their child go in such a young age
What did I say goodbye? 😢I love you Seungmin!
Трогательно и потрясающе точно переданы все эмоции!  Спасибо, Сынмин! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Seugmin your voice is Beautiful
Dont mind me im just…crying again 🥲
Seungmin is so underrated his vocals are so beautiful like his face and personality he is perfect ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A VOICE THAT YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO ENDLESS!!! THANK YOU, SEUNGMIN, FOR YOUR HARD WORK, YOUR VOCAL, YOUR EXCELLENT USE OF YOUR MAGICAL VOICE, AND YOUR BIG LOVE FOR MUSIC! YOU ARE THE BEST VOCALIST AND SINGER!
This is a masterpiece !!
This Music is beautiful seugmin is beautiful too
not even 3 words and im crying stop-
Seungmin and Chan together wanted to convey the vulnerability of the song and its emptiness  in perspective, so they recorded this without backing vocals - just the main vocals of Seungmin, no adlibs, no layering. And the chord progression, and percussion shows the hope that arises amidst the loneliness.😊  I am just glad that Chan gave this song to Seungmin, he said it was such a deep song to him. Yet, because of their artistry, they were able to put out this masterpiece which was hidden in Chan's laptop for a while.❤   Sending warm hugs to Seungmin, Bang Chan and Bhang Family 🤗
Always find myself going back to you - "Goodbye".😭💙
3 Months and I replay it before bed wow..
It is a crime that this was not released on music platforms. I want to be able to belt this at the top of my lungs at all times. Heartbreakingly beautiful.
BANG CHAN: BEST LEADER. SEUNGMIN: BEST  VOCALIST. "GOODBYE": BEST BEAUTIFUL SONG.

THE KING OF PERFECT VOCALS - SEUNGMIN .
Esta canción dolerá toda la vida 🥺

This is my fav song 😍💖
I miss them
Honestly imma do a lyrical solo to this song 😭❤️‍🩹
I’ve put off listening to this. I have been going through some stuff and knew this would hit me hard. But my god, this is so absolutely heartbreakingly beautiful. I have a little boy and I will support him in everything. I know Chan’s parents are so proud. But they are so incredibly strong for letting him go and pursue his dream. This is my favourite song from now and forever 🩵🩵 Seungmin sang this perfectly and captured the feelings of parents so wonderfully. 🥹🥰
Even though this song is based on Bangchan's story, having Seungmin's voice makes it more deeper and emotional. Whenever I hear it, I cry 😭
SEUNGMIN'S BEAUTIFUL VOCAL IS AMAZING IN ITS BEAUTIFUL AND MELODIC SOUND. I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEUNGMIN'S OST TO COME OUT TODAY. I'M SURE IT WILL BE SUPER COOL!
His voice is so beautiful 💕
LITERALLY THE WHOLE FANDOM IS SOBBING BRO T_T

You want to come back to this song over and over again. SEUNGMIN's wonderful voice captivates you from the first note to the last.
Chan made this song and seungmin made this so much emotional 😢
This song is so beautiful and has a most beautiful inspiring meaning behind the lyrics. It made me cry and I want to thank Chan for saving me and inspiring me even becoming my bias wrecker for life. He has caught my attention and found his old live videos that made me smile. Hearing seungmin sing this song with his beautiful and amazing voices made me love it more and cry. It's so beautiful and strong meaning with it. I wish I could thank Chan and the members for everything. Even give them a big hug for saving me even Chan too. ❤️🥺
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
SEUNGMIN's amazing vocals are so soul-healing. BANG CHAN's lyrics and music are masterpiece. The guys put so much effort into making "GOODBYE" so majestic.
Um grande abraço ao Bang Chan e a todos nós que sentimos profundamente os significados dessa música.

Hey, dimpled, how are you? I love your dimples. Can I press those cute dimples with my finger? As an Azerbaijani, I miss you. I really want you to come to my country. There's no hope, but there's waiting. Let's meet before it's too late. I love you and always will. It's okay that we have 8 years between us; age is just a number, right?

Here are the lyrics to "Goodbye" by Seungmin:  *Verse 1* If I could change the rhythm of time I'd go back and forth a million times If that's what it takes to keep you right by my side My dearest, I'm sorry  *Pre-Chorus* Hurts so deep inside I shouldn't have let you go Why did I say goodbye?  *Chorus* Holding your hands, yeah, we'd never let go Squeeze 'em five times, that's our own little code Told you good night but you're spending all-nighters alone Should've never said goodbye I wish I could turn back the time  *Verse 2* Can't help but notice you grew up so well It's all I ever wanted, but I should've been there The things that you have been through, I wanted to protect you, I swear My dearest, I'm sorry  *Pre-Chorus* Hurts so deep inside I shouldn't have let you go Why did I say goodbye?  *Chorus* Holding your hands, yeah, we'd never let go Squeeze 'em five times, that's our own little code Told you good night but you're spending all-nighters alone Should've never said goodbye I wish I could turn back the time  *Outro* Dear Mom and Dad, I'm sorry, I tried To stay the same but to my demise The things around me have broken me up, but still I'll always love you ¹ ² ³

SEUNGMIN's delightful, emotionally charged VOCAL conveys the beauty of this song. A VOICE that you want to listen to constantly, endlessly, for the rest of your life...

What a beautiful, soft, gentle, and touching voice the talented MINNIE has. He sings the song CHAN with such soulfulness, evoking the most vivid emotions in the hearts of STAY. BANG CHAN definitely knew who could sing this song so beautifully.
The song was written so beautifully by Chan and sung so perfectly by Seungmin. I’m touched in my soul. It made me think of my brother that passed.🥹💗 Thank you for this.

This song made me cry so much when I first heard it but it felt so cold cuz bangchan wrote it was so sad but seungmin those are some insane vocals but this song is so sad man it most made bangchan cry so when he wrote this song cuz it's a lot of feelings that some people can't be replace with new memories 😭
I'm sobbing while hearing this song😢
THIS SONG WILL STAY IN MY HEART FOREVER
Levanter: my friend broke off our friendship Lost Me: my STAY friend broke off our friendship Leave: My dad passed away Goodbye: My beloved cat died.  well, I don't know why, but the meaning of the songs above became a reality right after a few weeks of me liking those songs.
Channie when you read this, I just want to say that you are the best and most special leader I have ever met in my life. Always be happy, don't hate yourself because many people love you more than themselves, you give us a lot of hope that as long as you are around, we will live a dark life with the light you give; live longer and let's be happy always🤍 STAY ALWAYS WITH PRECIOUS STRAYKIDS FOREVER❤️

Revisiting this masterpiece. Beautiful and heartbreaking no matter I have heard it.

listening it while im far away from my parents for study purpose! i miss them a lot
SEUNGMIN'S BEAUTIFUL VOCAL IS ALWAYS AT ITS BEST. HE DOES EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT SO. Another true vocal treasure.
The only thing that makes me cry is this, but one day we had to leave home and follow our dreams, they supported us but it's time to leave their side
SEUNGMIN 's BEST vocals capturing the emotional CHAN was trying to convey with this unforgettable song.

This song is very meaningful and touching. It's a perfect song written by Chan and sung by Seungmin.
Seungmin sang Bang Chan's heart like it was his own. This group just has so much love and silent understanding of each other they convey each other emotions so flawlessly. 😌🤚

You once said you liked your imperfections, look what you've done so far, look where you've come, You can see all the people who still love you around you, right? Isn't that what matters? My support from my fans and family, maybe it's not the imperfect but the most perfect, and an angel,That I love very much.❤

Every time I hear this song, I think abt how hard it must it been for channie to live that long without seeing his family. What he went through was really touch, especially for a child.

How much I love Minnie's UNREAL, BEAUTIFUL voice. His performance is so touching, soulful, and sincere. SEUNGMIN is the only one who can convey a wide range of emotions through his vocals, making every song his own.
Goodbye is the only song that made me cry for the first time when I found out the meaning I can't even imagine what it's like to be someone who experiences it 😊❤
Me pueden decir de q trata la letra porfa?, esq no c ingles y me encanta
Какая же красивая песня... И какая она трогательная... Мое сердце сжимается сильнее каждый раз, как слушаю
La più bella canzone in assoluto, subito dopo aggiungo Cover me <3<3

It's a song that comes from the heart. It would be great to see this song in sign language. At every concert, in every country, in their own sign language.
The more i listen to it, the more i cry... This very emotional song!!!
Thank You CHAN & SEUNGMIN for never forgetting to express yourself though MUSIC we will always be here by Your our side.

back again and cry again this song so emotional seungmin 💞
:,( ojalá poder abrazar a Chris y dejar q desahogue. Debió haber sido duro dejar toda su vida en Australia para poder conseguir sus sueños de ser cantante, sin saber que eso conllevaria a quebrarlo y tratar de sobrevivir solo. Hasta que conoció a los miembros. 😔❤️‍🩹
#seungmin çok güzel duygusal bir sesi var 😢❤
IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL SONG. At the same time, it conveys so much PAIN through SEUNGMIN's singing that it breaks your heart. THANK YOU TO CHAN AND SEUNGMIN FOR THE SONG. IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT, AND EMOTIONAL.

THE SOUL IS HAPPY, EVEN THOUGH THE HEART IS WEEPING. SEUNGMIN'S AMAZING VOCALS AND BANG CHAN'S EMPATHETIC AND PROFOUND WORDS WITH MUSIC. THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF TWO GREAT BOYS' TALENTS.
omgggg☄️🎀
He has a fantastic voice, he could go solo he has the voice to stabd alone.
This annoys me all the band gets more lines  to sing or rap than Binnie does, he raps better, he sings better, be fair.
I cannot hear this song and do not cry moved me a lot so touching ❤
I really wish this was on Apple Music
I'm really proud of Chris he has worked so hard in life he left his home at about 13 to make his dreams come true he was an amazing leader(still is) managing to take care of 7 kids and I'm really proud of him that takes hard dedication I hope he knows how many people love and and stray kids ❤  Well done Bangchan you will always be admiring to people.

It makes me cry 😭 even if I don't know Korean 🥹🫶🫶
I love you so much 😭😭
I can tell  How much this feeling hurt being so far from family and home 😢
SEUNGMIN's amazing vocals are like a balm for the soul. BANG CHAN's lyrics and music are simply masterpiece. The guys are so talented, and they went to great lengths to make "GOODBYE" so unparalleled and emotional!!
I can’t help but cry whenever I listen tot his song. The vocals are just… wow. I relate to the lyrics very much. I love you skz❤
Amooo😭😭😭
Amo esta canción
새삼 이게 아이돌 개인 자작곡이라는 게 말이 안된다… 감정의 깊이라고 해야하나, 그런게 되게 무겁게 느껴지는 곡임…
Suddenly reminded of this song… Channie, Seungmin, Stray Kids you are so loved

Esta canción me hizo llorar mucho😢❤

Listening to this just now, I'm gonna crash out.

Сладкий и нежный голос переносит в самое прекрасное место в нашем сердце!❤❤❤
AN EXCITINGLY TALENTED PERSON WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE IN THE WORLD!!! I ADMIRE MINNIE!!!
Amooooo
This song is so powerful seungmin bring this for another level 🤍🩷
😭
i'll never forget this song
A lot of these lyrics remind me of an old friend of mine. She was a ray of sunshine and absolutely one of the best people I have ever had the honor of knowing. Her sickness hit her hard and fast, and within a week she was gone. Tomorrow is the 6 month anniversary of her passing. I miss her more than life itself and I wish with my whole heart I didn't have to say goodbye to her. This is such a beautiful song, thank you to Chan and Seungmin for giving me this masterpiece to cry to.   Rest well, my friend. I'll always love you. 💞🕊
It’s been a month since this masterpiece have been release, i’m listening to it again and it’s so touching that Chan wrote this song probably for his family and himself and even cried while writing this song and Seungmin singing this song, omg. I love you guys i promise i’ll STAY forever❤
Esta canción siempre me pone triste😭😭😭
I started crying after listening to the song, it's so beautiful. ❤❤
Chan having seungmin sing this was the best choice he could have made. All of the members are incredibly talented, but there is something about seungmin's voice that just elicits deep emotions. That mixed with the lyrics and melody and chan has created the ultimate tearjerker. There has always been something super special about chan, and he continues to make us proud with his leadership and songwriting. ❤
can't listen to this song without crying my yes out
The real version of "Unsaid Emily" 😭😭😭
Ugh I was just reminded of this beauty
Vengo otra vez a llorar 🫂
Congrats Seungmin and Chan for those 7M.
I WAS NOT PLANNING ON CRYING TODAY OMFG 😭😭😭
This is the most beautiful song, Chan 🥺 and Seungmin's voice brought it to life. I cried ...like a baby 😭 as a mother of 4 (all of who are adults now...all your ages) who's made mistakes...this resonates hard with me. This will forever be my song to them ❤️
Seungmiin vocaal💞✨️
This song has feelings Seungmin your voice is beautiful and sweet thank you for being in stray kids + I love you all 😖😔💗🩷🦋
Que triste cansion de banchan y seungmin
SEUNGMIN congratulations for 7M this song is perfect ❤
Beautiful song. Cannot listen without crying. Deserves so many more views, but we can’t be crying every day! 😢
😭😭😭😭
SEUNGMIN IS THE GREATEST VOCALIST EVER
Поздравляю эту замечательную песню и стей с 7 миллионами просмотров, поздравляю Сынмина с такой популярностью этого произведения искусства!
Звук твоего голоса, Сынмини, такой неповторимый и сладкий и живой, он пробуждает самые невероятные эмоции!  ❤❤❤
I CAN'T STOP LISTENING AND WATCHING THIS!!! I'm obsessed with SEUNGMIN and his divine, angelic vocals. HE'S THE BEST AT THIS!!!
This song makes me cry every time I listen to it! It reminds me so much of my oldest brother who moved away when I was really young and we didn't talk for several years and now that we are adults we have reconnected. Thank you to Bangchan and Seungmin for making this song ❤️😢
Im in choked sobs. Chan, how my heart breaks....
About to cry😭
Simplemente una canción hermosa y el que lo canta!!🤩🥰😍
Wait. Does this mean that Chan regrets to be an idol? Or I am wrong?
This is the most beautiful song i heard in a long time.💗
Aquela música que pega no coração de todo filho(a) que saiu de casa pra estudar
I listened to the song a little late but tears are all over my face, writing the comment with blurry vision…  - 02.09.25
can't listen to this song without getting emotional
Nakakaiyak??? 😭😭😭
I'm not crying u are 😭😭
esto me recuerda a mi mamá flora que en paz desncase
Listening to Seungmin’s ‘Goodbye’ reminded me of Luke’s ‘Unsaid Emily’ from Julie and the Phantoms. Both songs feel like emotional letters—full of love, regret, and the ache of things left unsaid. 🌊🤍  🎶
Llore 😭😭😭
so wonderful song back again love this song oh your amazing voice seungmin 🌺
This song makes my cry every single time I hear it and yet I can't stop listening to it. It's so sad yet so beautiful. Seungmin brought this song to life with his amazing vocals.    Chan I'm sorry for your pain, I wish I could give you a big hug 🥺❤
This song makes me wanna cry
Its my favorite song from now…🥹💛
3:30 bangchan wrote the lyrics right, how could we let bangchan be so hurt without comforting him. omg im crying😭
The second verse hits me so hard because I had to give up my son because his mother didn't want him, and I wouldn't have been able to take care of him by myself
I cry every time i listen to this because it remind me of my family but I know that they are way more hurt on the inside the way they live is so difficult and there are no words for this song
Эта песня прекрасна!
L ascolto e piango ogni volta
this song made me cry
I’m in llooovvveee❤❤❤
I'm listening to this while my friends are saying that they are not good enough and that they were too harsh on me and dragged me to stuff like that and I will actually cry
Such a beautiful song it brought me to tears 😢😢😢❤❤❤
seungmin's vocal is amazing ❤
❤
😭
seungmin and bang chan is a unbreakable duo .... They're the duo that always stay behind each other's back at times.  WE LOVE YOU STRAY KIDS ❤️
This is a really amazing skng seungmin❤❤❤
1:00 😭
A PERFECT AND VERY COOL SONG!!! I WANT TO LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME, WITHOUT STOPPING.
Şu çocuğu nasıl sevmeyip linçliyolar çok tatlı ve cana yakın bence gülüşüde çok güzel ve ayrıca sesi çok huzur verici grubun ana vokali olmayı hak ediyor (grubun her üyesi grup için çok değerli)(minho duygusuz değil,jeongin fazlılık değil aklıma başka gelmedi ama bir sürü var bu çocuklar size ne yaptıda onlara bunu yapıyorsunuz)
On Spotify PLEASE I’m crying
Almost two months after its release, it's been two years since I lost my mom to cancer. Even though I love the song so much, it reminds me so much of my mom, and it hurts, it makes me cry. I just want her to come down from heaven, hug me again, tell me she loves me and that I'm doing well:') Thank you, Chan and Seungmin, for such a beautiful masterpiece♡
I DONT KNOW WHY BUT WHENEVER I AM SAD I PLAY THIS SONG ON IT REMEMMBERS ME OF OUR LEADER SO I CRY BUT I AM SO THANKFUL THANK YOU CHAN
Im sorry my younger self...i wasnt able to make mom and dad proud of us...sorry i let go of your innocence...i hope you can forgive me...❤️‍🩹

I HATE BANGCHAN (HUMOR, I LOVE BANGCHAN), HES MAKE ME CRY WITH THIS 😢

🥹🩵
I admire this talented person! SEUNGMIN is incredible as a person and amazing as an idol.
Taro di appmus PLZ
Do you think he regrets his decisions? He worries me so much.
Breaking my heart on purpose by listening to this LOL
Its 2 months and i still cannot listen to the full song...sobbing right from the start
Nunca me cansaré de la voz de Kim Seungmin y de su manera tan cálida de interpretar cada canción que canta.
They are the people I listen to when I’m mad or sad like Chan’s once “ don’t … don’t hurt yourself” the fact that they went through so much trouble for us STAY I never want them to disband if they i will never be the same
This song is healing a wound I never had 😅
Bellissima ❤ grazie stray Kids ❤
and here i go again, crying every time i listen to this
back again and cry again this song is wonderful ❤️
SEUNGMIN IS SO GENIUS, SO TALENTED. LISTENING TO HIS AMAZING VOICE IS A PLEASURE.
❤ not crying and why does boy sing sing like he can fluent in English
Stay asta la muerte
😢

This got me crying in my bed at 1 am😭
Ahhhhh Chan-ahhhh my shaylaaammm 😭
Me encanta esta canción desde que la escuché por tictock ❤❤ la ameee gracias por crearla ❤❤❤
Every time I come back to this song, I sob like a baby and want to give Bang Chan a hug, like the biggest squeeziest hug. I just hope upon hope that he feels happiness now, true, genuine, happiness.
Какой же у Сынмина великолепный голос! Каждый раз, когда слушаю его, мурашки по коже.  Давно, во время Kingdom он пел с Чонхо и участником из Btob (не помню его имени) песню Love poem. Она была прекрасна! Но сейчас особенно слышно, как он много работает над голосом, чувствами. Это завораживает 😍
the third song now where i cry and its always because of seungmin
SEUNGMIN'S VOCAL IS AMAZING. IT'S SO WONDERFUL THAT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S REAL...
THIS IS MAKING ME CRY I NEED MORE TISSUES DOES ANYONE HAVE MORE 😢

What a beautiful, soft, gentle, and touching voice SEUNGMIN has. He sings with such soulfulness, evoking the most vivid emotions in your heart.
Made me cry 😢 so wonderful ❤

진짜 슬프면서 희망찬 따듯한데 서글픈 노래다 땨땨 노래가 점점 더 깊어지는 것 같오.....흑 진짜 노래하는 김승민 누가 이길건데...보물이야 증말루~~~
How to LEARN TO BREATHE AGAIN after this DEEP and EMOTIONAL MASTERPIECE by CHAN and SEUNGMIN??? An incredibly emotional song, both in terms of vocals and lyrics and music. The guys put so much soul into this song and it shows.
bangchan, your song is beautiful
best song ever wrote
Porque esta canción no está aún en Spotify???
JYP, si por alguna casualidad llegases a leer esto: te lo imploramos, sube esta canción a Spotify. Haz un álbum recopilatorio con todos los SKZ récords que no se han lanzado allá todavía.
I cried listening to this. 😢😢🤧
When I was little, walking with my mom and brother to the bus stop at the school my mom teaches, we'd randomly squeeze each other's hands, either 3, 4, or 5 times, all meaning "I love you" in some way. This song made me remember that... when my brother wasn't a demon child then😒
hoy ando sensible y me hizo llorar pensar en todo lo que los chicos pasaron para llegar a donde están 😭no solo channie😢
Llore 😭😭😭😭😭
This is song is so meaningful and amazing, every time I come back and listen to it I start sobbing because I think of my family and when my uncle died because he kept the sickness he had a secret from us. 😭😭😭❤❤
Music name pls🥹
Still here not over this song...

المشاعر بهاي الاغنية والهدوء خيالي كل ما اسمعها تتحرك مشاعري لا إرادي متحمسة يجي فصل الشتاء واسمعها والدنيا تمطر🥹🩷
