Female commentator, Alexander Arnold winner. Carlsberg doesn't do games you're lucky to never have to watch again, but if they did, it would probably be the best in the world.
I swear I heard GET OUT a few secs after Macalister score ☠️
I think ive watched this match as many times as the Barca semi
Mac allister's goal🤯🤯
maaria hates me
BANGER!!!!!TRENT MAC CHEYSEY
How could you listen to this woman commentating for 90 minutes- Christ that voice just hurts mybrain - hope this political correctness reverses soon or my days watching football on tv are over
Alexander-Arnold, Mac Allister and Endo score STUNNERS in REMARKABLE Reds comeback! 🤯 | Liverpool 4-3 Fulham | Premier League Highlights
Even though it was three three he scored the winner
anyone else here after trent left as a rat…
Came for 1 goal 0:11
good
The roar after McAllisters goal is godly.
My fav game of L.F.C❤️❤️❤️
Liverpool only scored crazy goals.😱
Anybody else tirn the commentary down? I did.
All goals were good
Only bangers for lfc
Yhshd
Giving Trent's freekick as an OG is disgusting!!!!
The good ending
Let liverpool cook
the top corners took a beating that game.   ♥
pov: watching this in 2025
0:09 0:57 2:12 2:33
I couldn’t listen. Women and football…. Soz girls but just annoying!
Just turn off the female.
What a game for Liverpool but if I wasn’t a Liverpool fan I’d think Chelsea vs Man Utd was more better
4 crazy goals 💀
best match ever in my opinion in prem this season
Still one of my favourite games to watch
Why do we have women commentators for the men’s game? Totally ruins it
What a goal by Trent
honestly, im sure the two ladies commentating the game are lovely people, but this has to be one of the worst, anticlimactic commentaries for such a good game that ive ever seen. embarrassing sky, embarrassing.
this is literally like eafc u score the best goal and then they score the luckiest and then u score in the last death of it and win😂
Trent has one of the best right foot in the world but that was one of the best goals I’ve ever seen
Perfect way for Alexis to score his first Reds goal!
Goal of the season - leno😂
how were all of the goals absolute screamers for liverpool
I was there ❤❤❤❤❤
Mo Salah
Liverpool is the best team and this match 🥶
this game was 8 months ago.
I was at the game, atsmophere  was crazy

Bro Alexander Arnold with his crazy free kicks 😩
Commentry is god awful and takes away from a special match.
Still shite commentary
HELLO SKY
Oh wait I did not mean to forget the full stop
Hi guys this is Sam perkin and I just wanna say what a goal by Alexis Mac allister and also I know three people that surrport Liverpool but I surrport wolves because they are the best team in the world
Why were all the Liverpool goals absolutely class
What a way to score your first goal of the season for Mac Allister. An absolute rocket of a goal and a rollercoaster of a game!
Tomorrow I will scream  Because of that goal
remered and had to come back and watch.
1:01 even the liverpool players who were warming up were amazed at mac alister
Now he’s just scored another one Trent owns them lad and he shushed them twice 💀
Why did Trent's free kick count as an own goal from Leno?
As an Lfc fan I watched live all of our goals were worldies
Trent 88th minute winner with FOUR crazy goals!!! 🤩🤩🤩 | Liverpool 4-3 Fulham | PL Highlights
Jiminez is so lazy
tsmikas clear foul for the last goal typical
Omg that mac allister goal! I almost lost my mind!
Yeah I know but u know what I'm like babe with these people I don't think she will be coming 66666 but I think we
Who was trent shushing 😂
Damn it.
Liverpool is a good place for the Premier League  👏 🙌 👌 👍 😉 😀
i loved mac allistars goal and how was trents free rueled as an own goal. while Liverpool score 4 bangers fullham score 3 flucky goals and sue smith is such a good commentator. and i go to alot of liverpool matches nearly all of the home ones but that one WOW!!!!!!!!
What a comeback
That goal from Alexis was absolutely incredible
"leno's nowhere near it" goes down as a leno own goal 😂
Fulham very good this day...
Nah that macca finish was unbelievable 👌
I was amazed that day
Was there, limbs, absolute limbs
He’s so far ahead of every other full back that has played in the prem.
SHOULDVE BEEN 3-2 FULHAM, OUTRAGEOUS
The funny thing about come backs as a Liverpool fan is that you can't handle it when it's happening but when you watch it back it's the most heart warm watch off a game off football.
Cockroaches of football
Liverpool has no real class
What a great game
Even though i am a man utd fan...WHAT A GAME THIS WAS MUST BE ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF 2023 IN MY OPINION
That voice is like nails on a chalk board
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😝🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OH MY GOD😁
free kick goal by TAA
All our (Liverpool) goals are possibly up there for the best QUALITY of 3+goals scored in a single match by 3 different players
What a win for Liverpool at Anfield with Trent Alexander Arnold scoring the winner
Liverpools goalkeeper didn't try lol
The body slide + Preds oh man…..
😎🇮🇪We were there
Trent is underrated
The passion in this club is unbelievable
A game of screamers
Anyone keep coming back to this?
Notice for liverpool only scored banger and fulam only scored taps in thats shows liverpool are the best english club
Some incredible goals from Liverpool. but we have to acknowledge how Fulham played, scoring 3 goals at Anfield is incredible regardless of no points. Well done.
I turned the game off when FULHAM made in 3-2 with only 9 minutes to go and couldn't believe it when my brother and said we'd won and obviously i didn't believe him in the slightest because he says some ridiculous things sometimes.And i checked BBC SPORTS WEBSITE and couldn't believe my eyes but what a game and FULHAM definitely bought there A GAME with them to ANFIELD and went TOE 2 TOE with us.And it was only the brilliance of some of the goals that we won that game in the dying minutes so got give FULHAM the credit they deserve .But OH DEAR  KELLEHER was awful in GOAL and i get its his 1ST GAME in a long time but i dont care he plays for LIVERPOOLS and is our No 2 so you should be absolutely ready for it.And now we've just DRAWN FULHAM in the CARABOA CUP and lets hope its another THRILLER but with ALLISON in GOAL.But we definitely need at least 3 PLAYERS in the JANUARY TRANSFER WINDOW a CENTRE BACK DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDER  RIGHT BACK  But not expecting any with FSG scroogey b*st*rds as ownwers .But this LIVERPOOL TEAM ain't no PREMIER LEAGUE winning SQUAD not even close its between ARSENAL and CITY IMO..
Why do we have to endure this shrieking banshee?
Prime Trent🔛🔝
Liverpool goal are fire 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉how
How did Liverpool score all off those!?
Not sure why i busted laughing when the commentator said "Liverpool aren't scoring tap ins today"
trent is just to good
Best match I’ve ever seen
No one talking about trent
1ST place now
Why are people saying his first goal was an Own Goal?
LL RR and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and the morning and
Excellent game mediocre commentary
Now top of the league and theyre not even playing well with rhythm 🔥🔥🔥
What a match for liverpool, scoring bangers
Mcallisters goal put me off my feet
Horrid henry and her sister on comms 😂😂😂
Only banger goals
are the male commentators jobless now?
Gomez is shitteee!!!!
Every goal were the best mac allister was the sickest one❤
Only bangers
You Will listen to female commenters, and you Will like it
Coldest edit ever👊
Great commentary from the ladies. MACALLISTERRRRRR... Shades of Aguerooooo in that. Quality!
Great game but had to mute it, painful commentary, sky just ticking boxes as usual.
We scored only bangers and they score tap ins all game. UP THE REDS
first time a full back has scored 2 in a game since leighton baines.
whos some kids commentating the game ???
3 of the 4 goals from Liverpool were in the exact same place. They figured out the keeper's week in that corner
The best fans Liverpool have are from ireland
We've got 4 players in Trent, Maca, Endo and i would include Szobs, who are all confident in long range shooting now. Expect more spectacular goals from Liverpool this season!
had to watch on mute
great game shocking commentator
No media coverage on it going through Allison's legs?
Trent alexander arnold ❤❤❤ his definitely becoming my favourite liverpool player what a player
Two women commentating 😴🛌
Wow this was beautiful to watch, that freekick then followed by mckalstier goal was just something else some epic goals, all top bin screamer's.
Woman commentary bye
The commentary for this epic match was shockingly low energy. No offence but the lack of bass in a woman's voice eliminates a lot of the gravitas in what they're saying.
Women commentary 🙄
This is my 6th watch
I don’t want to hear this little teenage boy commentate on any more premiership games. 🤦‍♂️
3 goal of the season contenders in one game?!
Yeah 4 WHAT a GOAL MAC ASLLISTER
4 bangers
with Allison in goal this is 4-1
Since my guy started wearing the Those Predators  All of a sudden he has turned into prime       Stevie G 😂
Chelsea fan here, and I'll keep saying this time and time again - you _cannot_ beat the atmosphere at Anfield.
Happy we won the game but this just exposes how poor we are defensively we get broken down so easily simple passes simples crosses hope this shows Klopp that we need a DM and a CB if we do that then we’re challenging for the title
Commentating is awful😂
4 absolute BANGERS from LFC
Mate what a game
Kelleher is probably one of the worst Premier league goalkeepers I've ever seen... At fault for all three goals. He's worse than Karius! Move him on to a league two club in January please
Dunno why Tete's goal was looked at. It was very clearly onside.
What a game dis was and i a liverpool fan and my fav player is mac allister darwin nunez gakpo or salah
Pity the men commentators had to call in sick.
We need Allison Allison should save those
Amazing goals and performance by Liverpool. But no one going to talk about how shite Liverpool’s keeper was? Where was Alison
Wow great goals from Liverpool
All of liverpools goals were amazing 😮
Liverpool won’t win anything with this shitty défense.
Liverpool were having their own goal of the month competition in this game 😂😂
Liverpool were brilliant. They kept fighting until the end. Macca got his first ever goal for the club, Endo equalised for us and Trent got the late winner!❤
How has that fourth goal stood shocking
Shame a great game had to be watched on mute.
Woman shouldnt be commentating  😂😂😂😂
What is this commentary? Absolutely horrendous!
As a Liverpool fan, HUGE respect to Fulham for putting up a fight worthy of those 4 goals
A Seven fest at Anfield Trent Alexandra superb Free kick commence the Scoring and would bag the Winner of a 4-3 game highlights.
Those goals were ridiculously wonderful.
Watch the highlights with the sound turned down much better
Liverpool need a stronger back up GK
Lfc sports fan base is so big that this game got more views than man shity vs tootehenham
A moment of silence for this abysmal commentary
McAlister puskas award
Female commentators, shrieking in my ear. Spoils it
How many top corner goals
2 women commentators😮, 1 not good enough, just isn't the same I'm sorry
Foul on the defender for the 4th surely 🤷‍♂️
I'm a Red, but to me that looks like a foul on their right-back for the winner. I didn't celebrate in case it was ruled out
Commentary almost ruins this.
defence,crap,,goals,world class,,fulham gave us a game,,but i just knew wed come back
Women commentators should commentate on womens football, men commentators should commentate on mens
This game is the perfect example as to why you need a gametime clock on these videos.
Na man women as a commentator was weird when Mcallister scored deserved agurooooo vibe 😅😅
These goals from Liverpool are amazing 💯💯 as arsenal fan , great football great goals awesome stuff .
Those are some class goals
The best collection of 4 by Liverpool since Suarez vs Norwich
I support Liverpool and Alexander just is a BEAUTIFUL GOAL❤
Where's the Celebration Police now? 👀
Had to watch this with the volume down , the commentary was a bit screeched
Not a single attacker  scored for Liverpool and they were all bangerss
Goosebumps is the only word to describe this match
Game of the season so far
Sounds like 2 pre-pubescent boys commentating ... doesn't work
The commentator does my head in ...fake voice ...
Trent was on fire Sunday 😊😊🔥🔥 good way to score your first goal to Alexis
Please stop this commentator commentating
Woman commentating is garbage in men’s football.
He done  the Stevie g walk
I got butterfly's in my stomach from trents free kick and mac Alistair absolute screamer
sadly had to mute this to watch :(
Had to watch this muted because of those two.... it's insane.
WAS EVERY GOAL FROM LIVERPOOL A WORLDIE
Should have been a foul Liverpool 4th
Liverpool win in a thriller 👍 4 absolutely stunning strikes from Trent, Endo and Alexis 👍 Pien Meulensteen and Courtney Sweetman-Kirk (returning to Anfield) on comms 👍. A perfect Sunday afternoon.
Those new adidas preds are doing wonders!
It says trents free kick is a OG by leno
WOW!!!!😃
Why did Adrián not play? This keeper is rubbish
WHAT IS THE LIVERPOOL KEEPER DOING
Hope Alison comes back soon
The commentators were awful and made a really good game difficult to watch. They sound like competition winners not professional commentators.
This is the Liverpool we love to see, every single hit was magic YNWA
Her voice puts me off from watching the highlights and taking it seriously 🙄
Great game but why is a women commentating this game - shocking
female commentary ruins it
Four screamers wow
Macallister does absolutely nothing all season & then scores what will probably be one of the goals of the season 😅
Why a female commentator? 😷
Honestly what was Kelleher doing for those first two goals for fulham
Female commentators are ruining my enjoyment of football. Have to watch this in mute.
Play RB and push Trent into midfield.  All Fulham’s attacks came from vacated RB area.
Problem is Southgate hasn’t the brains to use him. Blazer bey.
If this game had better commentators, then this would be game of the season
We are so back
For me, Endo was the catalyst  Genius by Klopp, telling him to win the ball higher up the oitch and knowing that Waturendo is the guy for big moments because he reads the game of exceptionally  Endo is small but he can't be bkamed for that...in terms of his effort, application and (surprisingly, thus far...2 in 16 with very few starts) output, I couldn't be happier  Also, I won't lie... I'm biased in favour of Japanese players going back to Kazi Miura and Hide Nakata👊
Endoscopy goal was unreal ain't it
EPL always great for high scoring games and sloppy defending 😂
Arguably game of the season but crazily took 4 incredible goals to get the win but tbf thus is wht title challengers do win when there not at there best well done Liverpool 👏
Any Fulham supporters i fully understand your pain 4-3 NUFC (twice) 😒
Garnacho goal or mac allisters goal😮
I lasted one minute, saw Harry the Welshman score a wonderful goal, but I could not listen to the commentary anymore???
I lasted one minute, saw Harry the Welshman score a wonderful goal, but I could not listen to the commentary anymore???
Kelleher pack your bag son theirs no place for you their your just not UpTo that standard
We finally have a title race goodluck Arsenal and Liverpool
two women football is ruined
Anfield, Man I wish they had the full 61,000 seats for last goal by Trent.
All goals scored in the same corner 🤯
GET IN TAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What gets on my nerves is the disrespect of Endo from our fans and klopp, everytime I’ve seen him play we get a clean sheet or win the game, he’s so underrated.  We need to play him as our main dm and put macca higher up, this happened today and see how perfect they all jelled.
we are LIVERPOOL banger after banger
That was handball by Salah before laying off Liverpool third goal. Fulham should feel robbed yet again this season by poor ref's and var.
Commentary is shite
No way Liverpool concede three goals if Allison was in goal.
Liverpool doing a Liverpool special. Anfield is just special.
You have to feel for Fulham. Played so well but lost to 4 world-class goals
Coming from a United fan. Worldie from Macalister
Deluded Pool fans on here,TAAs free kick hit the bar if it hadnt rebounded onto Leno it wouldnt have got near the goal unless it did a u turn, and for the fourth goal  Tsimikas flattens Decordova Reid at 2.30 mins and it should have been a Fulham free kick. You got the luck of the draw there.
We do epic comebacks
Trent is no rb is attacking midfielder material boy is class near the front line
Anybody manage to watch Rocket Ronnie win the Snooker, avoid the football scores and then watch MOTD. Super Sunday!!! 👌
Trent need to play att mid
I'll probably get cancelled but the female commentary really isn't the one
Not seen the whole game so perhaps harsh to criticise Kelleher, but I do think Allison would've done a lot better in stopping those 3 fulham goals, especially the first 2
Don’t mean to be a downer but Liverpool conceded 3 to Fulham and had to rely on 4 wonder goals to get the win. 3 points are 3 points but that’s not good for the immediate future 😅
Woman commentary is💀💀💀
The commentary 💀
The woman ruined the commentary
Trent’s celebration kinda reminds me of a certain Player #8
ref's had a howler there. he blew the whistle for a free kick just as grealish was 1 on 1 with the keeper. great game but i understand citys players annoyance
❤
What a hit son, what a hit.
Imagine if we had decent commentators for that MacAllister goal...
If this was away at Fulham this would be a fantastic result, as it was at Anfield it's still a good result but slightly concerning.
Chick commentary ugh...
sky picking the West Ham game over this, superb once again from them. just keeps getting worse and worse
These goals deserve better commentary, so unenthusiastic
Worst commentators ever my god women should have nothing to do with mens football!!!!
WOMENS PLEASE GET OUT FROM MENS FOOTBALL.
Allison needs to get back asap.What was kelleher doing that was awful goal keeping its a good job trent and McAllister was on fire that saved Liverpool.
Fulham fan here ,we kept going but in the end what can you do with supreme strikes by Liverpool especially Trent and MacAlister.
Am I the only one who thinks its a fould on the back post in the lead up to liverpools fourth?
Wow. What a game. Liverpool scored only bangers 💥
How does this commentator continue to be employed?
I presume as it's the famous scouse victims, we're (Sky and BBC included) just going to ignore the blatant foul for Liverpool's 4th goal, right?
How can they take Trent free kick an OG ???
Alexsis has a wand of a right foot and showed it today. Absolute beauty.  Endo was brilliant when he came on. Can’t fault Fulham today they were on it.
Liverpool really need a better backup goalie
mac allister celebration is so zesty hes like yasssssssssss 🤭🤭
Anyone got a link for male commentators? These just ruin the vibe and I can't watch it all the way through, it's awful
Why do female co commentators scream, it's time to turn off the TV.
Kelleher is questionable. Delighted our midfield has scoring abilities, it was something we lacked
This was absolutely brilliant from Liverpool but we just can't defend that badly and expect to keep winning, it's hard to know the answer, certainly Alisson would likely have saved at least 1 of those goals and Costas made a big error that Robbo probably wouldn't have made, so not terrible if we can get them back, the defence really needs to step up tho.
The female commentary totally ruined this for me😡
Foul should’ve been given before Trent’s 2nd goal.
Thank you Sky for ruining my Sunday football with 2 women commentators.
Foul in the build up for the final goal. What is officiating?
Why are Fulham fans so quiet home and away
Bad enough having one female commentator let alone two
This commentary is a poor reflection of a decent game.
Bring back Brian Moore and Hugh Johns,commentary is awful.sounds like a little kid.
Kelleher positioning is awful
Liverpool has to be champions I love this team
Fantastic goals from Liverpool in a fantastic game, Fulham deserve credit too, they look more like C.L condenders than a team in the bottom half
Diaz and Nunez are not intelligent footballers. Both are headless chickens.... we need intelligent forwards. Cannot play 2 stupid ones in a front 3.
Only problem with this game is it was played 4 weeks to early, imagine the noise at Anfield when there is 61000 fans
All of liverpools goals were very reminiscent of stevie g.
Mac Allister goal got Gerrard vibes all over it!
The Liverpool keeper was poor today
Fair play to Fulham for making a game of it 👏 from a Liverpool fan
two women in the commentary box
Jesus Christ the Liverpool keeper was absolutely shite
Am I the only person to have seen a foul in the Fulham box before Liverpool scored the winning goal?
How is that not a foul on the defender for the last goal? It's late and in the back.
4 Stunners in a single match! 0:05 0:55
1 2 3 in the goal of the month competition
Foul on Bobby before Trent winner... still an excellent finish but that gets given if it's the other way around
Great goals but Liverpool with the run of games in December are very vulnerable at the back with Kelleher in goal.
4 of the best goals you’ll see in football
Liverpool, Spurs and Man City fans have been absolutely amazing this season. They literally just go all out attack in every game. As a United fan, i miss when we would do this, or even attempt to do this. I was in college then, im married with a kid now.
TAA is actually SO GOOD at shooting.  It's actually insane what his assists and goal stats would be if he was a centre/attack mid all along instead of pretending to be a right back.
Heartbreak for Fulham
Trent is the best RB in the world rn.
I don’t like women doing a commentary
The Liverpool keeper should try saving one of the shots
Best club in the world.  NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER COUNT US OUT.  We are challenging for the title this season, mark my words. Up the reds! YNWA
Please stop with the women commentators it makes it hard to listen to
Aii we have to face them just before Christmas 🙃
Game of the season so far ?
Couldn’t have had worse commentary for this game🤦‍♂️
Can we please stop the female commentating 🤦‍♂️
Trent is clutch
Was that not a push in the back for the last goal😮
Why are there two women commenting men's game ?
Real commentary please
Some brilliant Liverpool goals there.
amazing goals from liverpool, but , what was the liverpool keeper doing????
We needed Alison
Trent was masterful he will make a great captain after Virg! Great goals also the Endo and Mac goals were sublime!
THIS SO CALLED WOMAN COMMENTATOR ABSOLUTELY DISTROYS THE MATCH.
This game was crazy. Feel for Fulham as they were done by some stunning goals where they all will be in goal of the month
Hendo is definitely regretting his departure 😅
Every single one of Liverpool 's goals were absolutely stunning. How can all four of their goals be worldies
To me Kelleher was at fault for all 3 goals.
I have to admire Liverpool here. Utd players like Rashford and co. should humbly recognise their lack of fight and determination compared to their northwest rivals.
Nobody does it better.
Sky sports need release this again with better commentary
Why are women commentating
Kelleher has no place as our backup keeper. Just poor positioning
The class of Liverpools goals this game
Womens commentators are so bad
4 rockets from the scousers!!
Game deserved better commentators
Reid was fouled before Liverpools 4th.
Just imagine when nunez gets abit more clinical to he's literally an animal it will be curtains for most teams with this Liverpool squad.. 😮
If Thiago comes back into this team and retains fitness, it's finito for the league.
Tears to my eyes!  These Liverpool comebacks
Couldn’t have had worse commentary for this game.
Wow how lucky were Liverpool lol great Goals fair play but awful! Defending!
This video is better on mute
I typed goal of the season contenders and this game popped up!😂😂😂😂
Big pile of screamers, savage
I love this team ❤❤❤❤
Oh lord, *two* female commentators
Can we appreciate that Kelleher is not premier league quality and so not be our back up
Outrageous from Liverpool
I love the cop in the corner celebrating instead of watching the crowd 😂
Liverpool ❤❤🇨🇲
Unfortunately Kelleher didn't prove himself
That gk needs sacking ngl
Im so confused as to how the first goal was an own goal for Leno?
Our defence has more holes in than the titanic,another fantastic game with world class goals,at least we are never boring to watch!
Kelleher is shocking n he wants first team football conceding silly goals like that
really feel for Kelleher. 1st goal - a keeper starting week in week out saves that.  2nd - just unlucky 3rd - Big Virj should be cleaning that up all day.
Some really poor camera angles on those replays
Shows you how important Alison is
How was the free kick from Trent an own goal?
Fulham should not have the right to come Anfield and get this lucky liverpool need to do better
How Liverpool scored 4 screamers I’ll never know
Why was TAA's free kick classed as a Leno OG?
That was terrible commentary
Can’t watch it with a shrieking female commentator
Alison is missed
Kelleher.... We're really missing Alisson.
Klopp has to seriously start thinking about moving Trent into midfield and signing a quality RB with a bit of pace. Liverpool are right in the mix but I think  moving Trent into midfield and signing a quality DM and RB wins Liverpool the league.
What a vision from Raul Giminez to assist Mac Allister stunner
Goalkeeper is our weakest link now.
Most obvious foul you'd see on Decordova Reid for Liverpool's winner, thought Fulham deserved a point
4 quality strikes from liverpool
Commentators did a fantastic job!   Hype women for sure 🔥
Fulham Goalie had a shocker
A new Stevee G guys! Well done Alex
Good game 👏
Both female commentators commentation on a man's game. Terrible .
I don’t remember when I saw 4 hyper-giga-mega goal from one team under 90’m.
Woman commentary's😢
We need more female football commentators and co-commentator in more games 💯
Commentators are a huge part in hyping up games, women should not be allowed to commentate ruins the whole atmosphere
Kelleher is horrible at goal
0:55 better than garnachos goal by FAR
TWO female commentators omggg kill me
Trent one of our own
Liverpool scores 4 absolute BANGERS
Hei! I was there...witnessing all the goals...🎉
Sorry but RUINED by screaming lady commentator..plz stay on ur own sports
Goal keeping was appalling for Liverpool
YOU WANT A THRILLER ????? GO TO ANFIELD
2 women on commentary? I find this highly offensive please change this 😏
"Absolutely no saving that" it wasn't even going in 😂
Great game, but Liverpool do miss Allison badly, kelleher positioning today was awful
Kelleher was poor for a few of those goals
Can't lie some shocking keeping from kelleher, needs to improve if he wants to be number 2 to allison
did trent play RB or CM this game ?
Those goals deserved better commentary.
We need to buy a first 11 ready right back and push TAA up in engine room were his vision will create so many opportunitys for us , I know we have Szobo but TAA is on KDB level , and when Bajetic is match fit and firing we have one of Europe's best midfields , or it's keep him in the "hybrid" role to accommodate Szobo   and rely on our no 6 and (or) the RCB   to cover which Ibu the outhouse is more than capable !!! PS ....."IT'S ON YNWA
nah nunez criminally slapped MacAllister 1:01 will forever be funny🤣
Woman commentating killed it for me 🤦‍♂️
That felt like a stevie g moment with trent their
So Trent has been denied the first goal, instead it is given as an own goal. Would Alisson save the first two Fulham goals? I think Kelleher could have done better. Liverpool defence is a worry.
Whose idea was it to let women commentate on men’s football? She killed the game with her soft voice smh
Sheff united Wednesday  no pissin around no excuses a  must 3 points
Why is there a woman screeching over the highlights ?
YNWA
Fulham players: We really need to play in formation and build around the centre, hopefully we can break them down with good passing. Liverpool players: Best goal wins boys!
anyone else get goosebumps at the end?
Imagine watching it with real commentators
As a United fan, it pains me to say this but you can't not appreciate every single goal that Liverpool scored today.
Endo with a bullet, Trent with 2 stunners and Mac Allister tops it with that absolute worldie!
Thought they would have given Trent that goal for the free kick
Wow wow wow wow so exciting to watch Liverpool.. ans klopps changes wow...nail on the head ❤
Watch on mute!
What a free kck by Trent COME ON LIVERPOOL
Anyone else have to mute the commentators ?
Caoimhin Kelleher needs to go absolutely pathetic
Take nothing away from the goals. But Liverpool have got to be better defensively.
Reminds me of FIFA, my goals are works of art; my opponents are pure shite and lucky
*TRENT HAS HACKS ON WHEN ANY SET PIECE IS GIVEN TO HIM I SWEAR‼️🗣️😭*
Mac goal! Wow!
Nah who was that in goals for liverpool
When your having a game of Fifa and your opponent wont stop scoring sweaty goals and you have had enough!!!
This is by FAR the best prem season for a VERY long time… brilliant goals… Man City failing… Man City may well win the league again but at least arsenal and Liverpool can make it good
Games like this make you appreciate Alisson
Trent is elite.
trent with 2 idc what the stats say, leno didnt touch it
Holy every LFC goal was an absolute BANGER
As an Arsenal fan there was some good goals in this game
Proper Gerrard moment that winner, Trent needs to be unleashed in the middle more often.
Have to turn the sound off as the shrill sound of the commentators voice goes straight through me! 😖 entertaining game though 👍
Absolutely ruined by two women on commentary. Just awful.
Really missed Alli today!
Great to return to Anfield after a long 6 years! What a game to watch from the main stand!!!!
Capel Celyn
Double female commentary? Really? No-one asked for this.
Pure Barclays this, what a game. Kelleher needs to improve, at fault for all 3 goals.
Shitty LiVARpool scraping by and getting lucky yet again. The VAR payments will continue next week
No idea how anyone rates kelleher even as a second choice goalie I can't remember seeing him ever claim a clean sheet...
Trent's 2nd goal should've been chalked off. Clear foul.
Fulhams left back reaction to Maccas goal was all of us. Bro was in disbelief 😂
From the way trent celebrated that last minute winner to Nunez running over to szabozlai and klopp and klopp hugging them to gakpo going crazy at the winner, absolutely every LFC player is trying their hardest and playing for the badge on their shirt 💪❤️
Hate to say it but they deserve that win all good goals from Liverpool 💥
If this waa grealish the media and pundits will make too much noise but always ready to put down TAA
Fair play to fulham man they really are one hell of a team, far cry from the team that went straight down a few years back
4 net-rippers there
Like Klopp Is Waiting and Demanding... The Lads know... They Have TOO DELIVER... THE KOP and ANFIELD... EXPECT... ❤❤🙏🙏⚽️⚽️
what a game...
They gave that first goal as on own goal to Leno crazy didn’t even touch it and didn’t touch his back that’s mad
Nah you can't script this at all
Liverpool with some bangersss today!
Excellent commentary: “Let’s not take anything away from Fulham, but completely against the run of play”.
Cal the dragon in goal
McAllister must have been watching  the stevie G video , of wonder strikes. ( what a great shot).
omg
I came to see the same highlights but mainly to hear different commentary... and I wish I hadn't bothered.
Wow. This is one of those games I wish I was at the stadium for😞
The fact that Liverpools goals seemingly came from nothing makes it seem as if they even deserved the win from a highlights perspective
Those weren’t four Liverpool goals, they were four absolute stunners!!
Nunez is the definition of Fifa scripting
This game shows how much we rely on Alison and that our defence is shambolic!
No one see a foul on Decordova-Reid before the Trent winning goal though? Great header clear and gets clobbered, or is VAR not allowed to give anything against Liverpool ever again?
Liverpool are always jammy.
Spoiled by the crappy commentating.....
This was not a football match. This was a goal of the month contest, and Mac Allister won.
All same corner bar tta last goal but all screamers
That freekick from Arnold tho.
Kelleher needs to do better in those moments. What a goal by the lads. Need to stay winning against the lower sides because we still have Man U arsenal and Newcastle yet to play in our next 6.
Ridiculous how trents free kick has gone as an own gosl
Didn't show Nunez' miss. Funny that.
If it were arsenal, we'd get it in the neck for celebrating like we'd won the league. Anyone else, not a issue.
I can't stand this commentary how can people stand these dishwashers ?
Boring, soon as Fulham went 3-2 up, I knew Liverpool were gonna win
What a fantastic match of the beautiful game
Are they serious giving first goal as an own goal !!!!
Terrible women commentators, ruins it.
Noticed how trent is so much better playing in a midfield position him, rice and jude in midfield for england would be unstoppable
Awful female commentators.
Not being televised on British tele should be a crime, 2 teams consistently in high scoring game was always going to be a classic. Meanwhile if I live anywhere else I can get it instantly
Foul on the Fulham defender before the winner, but a goal's a goal.
Come on you Red's!! Liverpool Liverpool!! Love you guy's!! Keep up the great work!!
Alexis Mac Allister is such a special player, truly awesome. We miss him a lot at Brighton. What a screamer.
Is it true that TAA freekick goal was given as an own goal 🥅 what a disgrace
Goals in this game was crazy.
Who is this Liverpool keeper the worst goal keeper..if he plays then Liverpool are in big trouble
Overrated
Liverpool just scoring bangers 😮 trents been quality. Forest fan😅
Fulham fans in the comments making me wanna be a Fulham fan
Trent is that guy this season👀
Great commentating 😂 sounds like a 12 year old doing a motty impression 🤣🤣🤣
Four insane goals by Liverpool wow
there’s your goal of the month already😮‍💨
Well Liverpool they are not scoring tapins today 😂
I remember when Man Utd thumped Ipswich 9.0 in 99. You wanna go check out them goals. Amazing
TAA is some player just hope he has an off day when arsenal go to anfield 😂
The fact TAA free kick went down as an OG is ridiculous
I was gonna say a team that defends like that can't win the league, but I was shocked to see that only Arsenal have conceded less goals than us!  That said, I still think this team is crying out for a specialist DM. I think that would bring all the pieces together nicely.
What can you do about four shots like those???
What's with the commentators
It's a shame Leno wasn't available and Fulham had to play without a keeper... 😂
leno conceded 4 class goals
Her voice does nothing for them goals or that game
There was a goal at Ipswich better than all these on Saturday
Man Liverpool must listen to Drill music during their warm ups, the teams full of shooters lol
How was Arnold-Trents "winner" allowed when it was a clear foul by Tsimikas!! Terrible refereeing. Will this game be replayed with such a blatant decision going against Fulham, i`m waiting for the media outcry calling for a replay.
Please don't let women commentate 😅😂
I just love Liverpool. I wished it was Liverpool I supported since I was young. Am tired of these manunited bullshit.
How was the first goal an og
Shocking officiating. How much extra time?  Also need to change the rules regarding being offside from a corner. Given that Man City are clearly focused on winning in Europe l think the title is yours
at the end of the day a win is a win and great performance from both sides.
Don't care that it's gone down as an own goal, it's trent's goal!
Sparkling goals from Liverpool.... Scrappy goals from fulham.
Trent. Alexander. Arnold.
So women get their own game and they get to take over commentary of the men's game too?   That voice is shrill at best. What is going on here?
no alisson so we struggled
Leno got done 3 times same corner 😂 COYG!!
I feel so sorry for Leno man😭😭😭
🔴❤️💪
Clear foul on the 4th goal. Can’t believe it was given
Had to watch this on mute. Women commentating drives me mad.
That was a foul just before Liverpool got their 4th
glad I didn't watch the game - would've given me a heart attack! Damn, each Liverpool goal was a banger!
Kelleher is no scrub but having been spoiled with Allison for so long..the drop of from him to Kelleher is mental
What. Game
This is just amazing football ! What a goals from Liverpool!
McAllister take a bow son.
The commentary ruins the highlights
Unbelievable Trent
How was Trent’s free kick given as an own goal 🤣🤣🤣
2 women commentators?
Fulham must feel terrible you might concede 1 wonder goal in a game but 4 unsavable shots is crazy.
Obviously kloop told kelleher to let one or two in today to keep it entertaining 😜😂😂
Liverpools keeper terrible
He has to play in midfield now. What a player
🤔 Do you think Liverpool have been practicing shooting in the top right corner? 😋
Are they seriously calling that an og
The difference in having a high quality keeper in the prem! I like Kelleher but feel 2 of those goals Alison saves.
Nunez damn near tried to knock out Mac Alister for the celebrations after his screamer.
Southgate still won’t play TA-A in any meaningful games but will still pick Maguire and Philips 😌
Some classy goals there
I'm watching on mute because female commentators do my head in
Leno must have felt cursed today! Smacked on the head, could do absolutely nothing about any of the goals, opposition keeper makes 2 bad nistakes and still ends up on the winning team 😂
2 female commentators ruined this worldie of a highlight reel
The commentators do not do this game justice
Great game both teams but Liverpools goals!!!! Wow
Great match, spoilt by that screaming bird commentating
Fair play to fulham didnt come to anfield and sit back especially when it was 2-2
To score 4 worldies in one game is quite unbelievabauble.
Ole TAA
That Commentator is so bland and dire.
Wheres martin tyler and andy gray when you need them
Commentators
That reaction was terrible from the commentators  for the macalister goal  😂😂
Rock and roll football is back baby, wish I wasn't working for this game
We got the most dangerous team in the prem 5 goalscoring Attackers Salah Nunez Diaz Jota Gakpo 4 goalscoring midfielders Szobo Mac Gberch Endo that can all shoot good and on target from long range & a RB Trent with accurate passing , crossing & shooting that scores 10/10 match winning goals and world class free kicks 1 of the best CB & goalkeeper in the world  VVD & Allison 1 of the best Manager/Coach in the world Klopp so many players still in there early 20s and the teams still rebuilding & gelling if we don’t get silverware this season the Team will be complete & at full strength next season for prem & champions league Trophies
Trent is such a good player. Absolute wand
One of the best goals Anfield has ever seen and also one of the worst goalkeeping displays too.
Fulham have been our bogey team for a number of years now, didn’t get us this time though 😅
Really nice to see how Trent is being given responsibility by both Jurgen and Gareth and he is blossoming due to it.
The celebration on the first goal was so dead get more atmosphere in my backgarden
...but woman's football wants to be paid the same...😂😂😂
That was a foul before the ball fell to him further final goal
kelleher...shite, whole defence....shite! Fulham deserved the win, lfc got lucky, klopp needs to give his head a wobble, hes spent so much effort and time trying to sort out the front, that the back is absolutely shockingly shite...conceding 3 goals, against a team who has the lowest goal tally so far this season in the PL...is pathetic.
As a neutral, throughly enjoyed it from start to finish, Trent’s technique is absolutely fantastic when it comes to ball striking fair play to him. The season already turning out to one of the best, what a game.
Everytime this woman commentates.. I have to turn mute the sound. She's terrible at commentating.. her high pitch shrill is just awful... ruins every game.. why do they have her commentating
Trent is on fire lately
I watched the game in Anfield today and what a game!
So happy for endo
This match is absolutely fantastic with stunning goals, but what lets it down is the female commentary 👎theyre the main reason why im turned off by modern-day football. Every Saturday morning, i watched Football Focus, not anymore. You have femsle panellists, presenters, and commentators...theyre the death of football
Was in the kop end for the game today, had the perfect angle for that Trent free kick 😍 and seeing that macallister ball fly in was special as well! YNWA
Then Liverpool striker are an amazing set of 4 I don’t even care, coming from Everton fan
Why the 2 female commentators? They just don’t sound anywhere near as good as the male ones
Commentary team were absolutely shocking. Main commentator has the worst inflections and sounds like she’s straining rather than excited. The commentator was unbelievably bland and offered nothing but cliches we would have thought were cringe in the 90’s.   This isn’t because they are women (there are plenty of men that are atrocious commentators now) but these two really stuck out as awful, they basically ruined parts of the game 🤷🏻‍♂️
Some quality goals there!
I’m an Everton fan, Idc, that Mac Allister strike looks absolutely amazing, defo can contend with Garnacho’s goal imo
Liverpool keeper is garbage
Every Liverpool goal was 🔥. Fulhams second was great play and goal also
As a Liverpool fan I’d be more concerned about the fact we scraped a win against Fulham, but think if Allison is in goal at least 2 of those don’t go in
Arnold 🎉👏🥳
What's the Liverpool keeper doing?
2 female commentators
Stop the female commentators
ENDO OUR DEKARED DEKARANGER! 🇯🇵 ⚔️
Loved the match but it got ruined by the commentators
This game had everything, unlucky Fulham they played well but Liverpool never give up especially at home, great goals and end to end, I'm a Liverpool fan and I thought Fulham pulled it off but then just like that Liverpool out of nowhere done what they are known to and that's pull off the unexpected, unlucky Fulham well played 👌
Great game but kelleher good keeper has to save those saw it coming to be honest 😯
Gutted that Trents free kick ended up credited as an OG.
All bangers lol
Female commentary has to go.
Garnachos bicycle was great. But even as a Man Utd fan mcallister it’s going to be contending for puskas.
this lady is a star when it comes to commentary
Female commentator ugh
Harry Wilson diving cheat
Porous, scandalous and pothetic  LFC differences and the goalie  as well.
only screamers form liverpool
Kelleher is a league 1 goalkeeper at a push
Does the commentator have to state the obvious so many times, she could do with a calming break now & then!
Why have fotmob labelled trents free kick as a leno own goal
The last time I saw a ball hit the back of the net like that McAllister goal was the 95/96 season Yeboah v Liverpool or Yeboah v Wimbledon. As powerful and as satisfying as a prime Mike Tyson upcut
This seasons serving up some sick games Jesus
Can anybody think of a game where one team scored so many spectacular goals?
The quality of goals in this game, my word.
women commentators are cringe
how has the first goal been given as an own goal. Leno is nowhere near him and it hasnt hit his back and gone in
Shame such a great goal from Mac Allister will always be heard along side that shite commentary
Goat
Shame that women commentator had to ruin the experience of watching it
Its kinda funny that all of Liverpools goaks were from at least 18 yards out but all of Fulhams were in the 6 yard box isnkinds funny 😂
Questions have to be asked about Kelleher...
Liverpool’s keeper absolutely terrible
As an ALL ROUND footballer Trent is better than Reece James, Trippier, Ward prowse and   Declan Rice.
Bangers 🔥🔥🔥
Alisson seriously missed. We can’t rely on worldies like that every game. Kelleher really poor for those goals. Ali saves 2 if not all.
What a game Trent best rb in the world 🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌
Liverpool keepers a joke!
The Irish Onana 🤦‍♂️ like he’s moving in quick sand
Liverpool having a goal of the season competition between each other
Liverpools shots today were on fire
This is one of them games where we couldn't watch it in England! 🤔🙄😳😳😳
Well played Fulham but unfortunately you bottled it. Should have been 3 points.
Kelleher is crap
Two women 🤦‍♂️ Utter dribble
The only goals in this match from Liverpool were bangers
If that's Onana in goal, he's getting slated....howler from the goalkeeper
4 worldies for the win and Trent is showing that Stevie G game in his performances!
Leno was wearing a hat
Great highlights apart from the commentary
Sky why wasn’t this on the tv and instead West Ham v palace was??
the fact that nunez hitting the bar wasn't even a highlight shows how crazy this was
Ngl the female commentators brought no emotions to this
wish we got proper commentators for this game
The way Trent can strike a ball like that, effortlessly is seriously impressive.
That goal from Mac Allister is sensational
I'm sorry but Female commentators are like nails down a chalk board!!!!  😟😞🤐
Actually feel for Leno. No keeper is saving any of those, 3 in the same top corner and one riffled into the bottom
Just got bk from game. I live in Newport South wales. Worth every minute of the drive up and bk what a game 🔥🔥🔥
When the hell did Liverpool get Son?  & Fulham were unlucky🥶
Own goal for Leno after Trent did that free kick he only scored on the 88th minute
Why is two tings commentating?
Bro 4 wonder goals (the 4th wasn’t that good but almost)
Liverpool fans will do well to remember this game at the end of the season
Richard from Pointless isn't happy
Good job Wataru ❤
fulhams goals were schoolboy howlers.
The commentary smh 🤦‍♂️
Too much screeching and growling, please stop with women commentators on mens games
I wanted to see gary nevile go OHHHH but i cant:(
Foul on the Fulham defender at the end there, Fulham robbed
Didn’t like tap ins today😂😂
Shittest commentator in the prem
Women commentators just aren't as good. Sorry.....
Darwin nunez celebrating at the end like he contributed anything 😂😂😂
First time where I've ever felt like football should have basketball scoring rules. 1 point for a free throw/penalty, 2 for inside the box, 3 for outside the box goals 🤣
The first 3 Liverpool goals could be goal of the season contenders.. unreal
The commentary destroyed the whole game
them predators do them goals fact ynwa
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHmjHHHHHHHHHHHH
This performance to come back and win is surely showing signs of a title challenging season .
How they didn’t give Trent the opener is criminal 🤨🙄😤
a female commentator?!?! world is going crazy 😂
What a phenomenal game from Trent thats what we like to see and crazy goals today from Mac and the others 🔥
When Kelleher again wonders why he's the back up Goalie all he needs to do is watch these highlights
That Mac Allister goal was a signature Gerrard screamer, what a goal from him
Liverpool holding their own exclusive goal of the month contest .
No one wants to say it, but lfc keeper was shite
Shocking commentary
Name me another game youve seen more world class goals in . No worries ill wait
Japanese international Endo scores a good goal -  "silence" south korea international son scores a good goal -  "OMG WE LOVE YOU SONY THE KOREAN KING," lol the British anti-Japanese media is ridiculous
All of them are just strikes wha like Ronaldo and Messi chat even hit they are such good strikes
I finally believed that the games are scripted. Makes me hate football
Can really tell when allison isnt in goal
First 2 seconds of video playing....aaaand MUTE sound
Mac goal was the best
Liverpool only score bangers
Please someone stop putting women in men's environments, commentate on women's football please & allow men to be pundits, commentators and all the rest on just about the only thing (football) we men have left that women haven't been allowed to invade & replace us.
Need Allison back
Defensively we are so poor. Matip and Tsimikas not good enough. 4 unbelievable strikes luckily get the 3 points
We was outstanding on the attack but I'm very concerned on how many goals we let in
Reminds me of scoring four bangers a match on FIFA.
Liverpool never lose at Anfield.
Love it.  Liverpool never lie down and never settle for a draw.. not even hitting top form yet .. stunning goals midfielder s chipping in with goals..   showing beast mentality.
What a horrendous commentary pairing.
Wish Peter Drury commentated this game 😔
Leno needs to be dropped
salah sets up endo.  picks the ball out of the net and then taa goal.  I think that's 2 assists for the price of 1
Commentary is terrible,just saying
Two women commentators. OTT
Im getting Liverpool 2018/19 Vibes were liverpools attitude was okay score against us but we just gona outscore you
Unbelievable reds, just unbelievable, the goals here were just unreal
Wow I love being a Liverpool fan 💯🙏✊👍❤️
kelleher was awful cost us all those goals due to using his feet and terrible positioning tsmikas was at fault for the 4th goal
Comedy defending
Gakpo needs to start up front now   Nunez as has his chance and he don’t know where the net is  Gakpo does
4 great goals by Liverpool Alexis was the pick of the bunch Trent wasn't far behind every time as a goalscorer Trent provides
Pov the one game I miss the goals are on this top quality
Amazing all 4 goals Should of started Adrian though them Attempts at saving from Kelleher was Like League 1 Goalkeepers
PL becoming like the Dutch league with all these open games and results lately. Seems Ange and De Zerbi are stirring things up.
so did trent score 1 oh 2?.....
I bet Trent’s fuming that his outrageous free kick has been given as a Leno own goal
13y old boys commentating
To be honest I think Liverpool love scoring top right hand corner lol 😂
Liverpool second goal will be top 3 of the season
Dunno if onana in goal or kellher
No one talking how liverpool scored 4 puskas worthy goals to win
Stick trent in some preds and hes become messi fr
Listening to two woman commentators is brutal
McAllister's goal was Gerrard-esque  and not since Beckham have England had a player that can strike a ball like TAA 😎
4 lucky and scrappy goals from Liverpool but a wins a win as they say.
Liverpool goals were mind blowing 🤯
Please have a speedy recovery ali ❤️
Sound off and watch it😮😂
Kelleher is awful
liverpool 4th goal is a foul
wish we could mute the commentary
Great game, shame about the commentary .
Both Enzo and Endo Scored today.😂
At the game today brilliant atmosphere and what a win!!!
This game would've been ten times better with peter drury and gary neville
Is the first ever top flight game to have two women commentating?
This just shows the difference in the top teams and everyone else. Even when they don't deserve it individual brilliance can see them through
Probably the greatest match this season so far only spoiled by the screaming screeching “commentator”.
Wow
How bad is Liverpool’s keeper 😢😢
Those Thursday nights are catching up with Liverpool
How on earth has that first goal been given as a Leno OG. I don’t understand 🤷🏼‍♂️
That looked like a foul on De Cordova-Reid for Liverpools 4th..
Why are two women commentating? They're so irritating
MacAllisters goal got to be in the seasons top 10, defence and goalkeeping was abysmal.
What a game wow then goals ❤YNWA!!!!
Women commentators ruins mens football more than var does!
Those Fulham limbs are the worst I’ve ever seen 😂
YNWA
Yahhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhh
Fulham with some brilliant link up play, deft touches, to get their well worked goals, and then Liverpool banging them in from distance.    Brilliant game of football.
We will not win the league with this defence. We can not keep conceeding goals and just hoping to out score the opposition all the time.  Kelleher is not good enough really. Matip is too old. Van Djk is just a joke of his firmer self
Endo done himself no harm today whatsoever. Hopefully, Klopp seems him in a better light. Mcallister's goal was the definition of a banger (take not other midfielders).
Surely lpools luck will run out sooner or later? Too many games this season where they have been average/lucky but managed to bag the points
Helluva game only spoilt by the female commentators
This should have been on TV instead of West Ham and Palace. What a game and some incredible goals!
alexander-arnold is on fire
Superb game. Maccas goal is serious contender for goal of the season. But don't how VVD doesn't try head the ball and allows 5 foot 7 Reid to score a header.
Love how excited the little boy commentating gets!
Pure genius..Trent... brilliant team spirit
Woulda been great highlights with the wailing banshee of a commentator...
straight up foul after the header in the last goal. Where's the VAR now?
Trent is world class this season
Stand in keeper has had a nightmare.
I hate Liverpool, but good lord are they incredible to watch.
Not just one but two women commentators 😥🤦🤦
Watched the match today and it was ruined by box ticking dull boring commentary,volume turned off
Terrible commentating
Teams visiting Anfield should remember never underestimate the might and passion Jurgen’s teams have
And now we see why Allison is so important for Liverpool, keeper shocking
This legit looks like an ea fc game 😂😂 dda is realllllll
absolutely astounding goals!!!!!
4 outstanding goals for the reds unbelievable goals ..big up YNWA
Blimey, this is a 5th times today  when rewatching the goals and still goosebumpsing 🤟👍😉
Came here to watch a men's football match and you get two women squawking on the commentary
Bloody hell 2 women commentators glad I didn’t watch this 😂 some banging goals tho
Trent when he’s had a haircut is brilliant.
Darwin kept the ball alive and that helped create  TAA 2nd. He always works hard definitely getting into his grove. Klopp will get the best from him eventually & he will be worth the wait…
Why the female commentators 😞
Tbf liverpools goals were 🔥
Female commentators spoil it
Need to sign a RB in January and play Trent in midfield and maybe buy a decent CDM to sit in the Fabinho role
How on earth does Trent Alexander not get in the England team. Absolutely ridiculous the man is an unreal natural talent 🙌
How can people say Trent is bad he’s class and today proved that
a great game reduced to under 3 minutes of highlights...
Wow, what a game!
There are plenty of big deflected goals which are given to the strikers but a pure strike is given as an own goal😅
Wow
The squaking of the female commentator is brutal. Volume off.
You would have got long odds on 4 great goals none from the strikers today
Female shouldn’t be pundits
Two female commentators on a men's Premier League game?
The commentary ruined the highlights for me ngl 😪
im not sure but this could be one of the best liverpool games ive ever seen, like the goals :0
Liverpool poor goalkeeping
What a game of football that was 4 world class goals from Liverpool could have lost credit to Fulham played well today but this team have a never say die attitude not many teams could do that getting beat with 3 minutes to go to win Newcastle with 10 men this is a team that’s great to watch
As soon as Klopp Subbed on Gomez I knew he just unleashed Trent Alexander Arnold from the leash. Amazing 👏
Still nowhere in hell that was not a trend gone nothing to do with Len0
How was that put as an own goal
How great would it be if the title race ends up being between Liverpool and Arsenal, 2 clubs who've gotten where they are currently, without oil money and without 115ffp charges against them. We can only hope.
You can't take away from the quality of those goals but questions do need to be asked of Livepool defence. To be challenged at home and having to pull worldies to save them is disappointing for a quality defence like Liverpool.
All four Liverpool goals could be contender for goal of the month ⚽️ 🗓️ 🏆
I knew Manchester United was coming up but didn't realise it was the next home game❤
Nunez should of scored today,But i wouldnt swap him for anyone else,He such a villian and was key to getting the last 2 goals YNWA
Wish you can mute commentary
What a match what a goals !
why is trents free kick classed as an own goal?
How can the first be a Leno OG??
These refs are shambolic
Liverpools goals were screamers and the comenator was like mmm ok wow! Bring the good comentators back.!!!!
Those Liverpool goals were of the highest order. Absolutely outstanding finishes. Another classic game for the neutrals.
Alisson’s absence for Liverpool was felt today for sure. He saves at least 2 of those goals.
Women commentating on the mens game gives me ear ache!!!!!!
Fulham and silva always know how to make Liverpool struggle, kelleher will be disappointed he didn't do better for the first 2 goals I think.  But all 4 Liverpool goals were worldies fair play, nobody was gonna stop any of them. This team along with arsenal are looking like the real deal this season, especially with City faltering slightly.
Commentators ruined this game
Please drop  these crap female commentators asap
Hate to be that guy but the last goal was a foul
2:35 best Red arrows you will see fly in Britain for a long time
Almost cried while watching this second time
Any1 else thought liverpool got away with one today, as before Trent scores there a late foul on the defender that he could have blocked it if he wasn't knocked over to the floor
Great come back win from the boys YNWA
Sweet as a nut! Felt that Mcallister one all the way! Cracking goals all round.
Can't stand the commentator
Score on screen please
we need to talk about darwin i feel he has had a bit of time now and he does get  the ood few   goals but i think he just lacks killer instinct i just dont think its something that can be thought
Nice goals
Ruined by a female commentator.
Could they find commentators that sound more excited when goals go in
Bangers
You need to win games like these to win titles... Not saying we've won the title but this result didn't harm our chances 😂  # LIV - ER - POOL  LIIIIVERPOOL LIV - ER - POOL  LIIIIVERPOOL #  😊  Cmon you red men  MAKE US DREAM BIGGEST AD MOST FAMOUS CLUB IN THE COUNTRY 😊  LFC  YNWA
That goalkeeper of Liverpool is a basket, Adrian should be in gaol next game. If not before Alison comes back Liverpool is in the 4th place
2 women. Good god
The goals were wild
Two screeching female commentators. Horrible on the ears.
This commentator just isn't good man
World class manager rebuilding a new look Liverpool side built on a dozen epl title winners...  Give this man some time and let this team find out more about itself as a collective.  At 2-3 I almost... ALMOST gave up.  # But we are Liverpool ❤ Tra La La la, we are Liverpool TRAAA LA LA LA LA Poetry in motion... #  😂
What a game! 😍
Amazing game!! And before anyone says it, I’m not sexist, but the commentary ruined it.
That Mac Allister goal is one of the best I’ve ever seen
It's only Fulham 😂😂😂
All of Liverpools goals were absolutely class
Liverpool were awful today. Great game for the neutrals and a good result in the end but we didn't really deserve to win being honest. Fulham were up for it more than us for most of the game . Its tells you everything that we have to score 4 goals to win especially against Fulham.
As much as I love Kelleher, this game makes me appreciate how good of a goalkeeper Alisson is
Why they got women commentating on mens game?
Three Sublime goals from Liverpool today 👌😶‍🌫️🫢🌌 like we needed anything else to show that this is the best club in the world ❤️
Had to mute that sorry.
This whole weekend has been amazing for football championship bangers to shows of incredible skill and insanely close games in the premiership mental
The commentary was like listening to teenage children
thriller of a game that no one could watch because sky decided to televise a west ham vs palace snooze fest…
All those beauty goals from Liverpool damn
The Liverpool keeper was shocking two easy saves and his positioning on the cross was comical
Just sensational.
O my god the high pitched voice of the female commentator is hard on the ears 😬😬
I had to watch this on mute, dear lord 🤦‍♂️
Unlucky Fulham. Those goals from Liverpool were absolute class. 👏🏻
This is how you become champions to win the league!
Trent!
I thought the commentary was poorly done
Can we have some make commentary please. Just men for once.
The standard of the commentary 💩
If it wasn’t for kelleher for the first two goals it would’ve been much easier for Liverpool such poor keeping otherwise Liverpool were great defensively
02:30. Blatant foul completely missed by the referee and VAR. Embarrassing.
Bring back Andy gray on commentary
Liverpools goals were 🔥
Our keeper was just bad
I don’t get it. Why does everyone rate Keheller so much? Massive drop in standards, looks like we are going to concede all the time when he plays. He doesn’t make glaring errors, he just doesn’t cover or fill the goal
Am I the only one who can't stand female commentators?
THIS IS MY TEAMMMMMMMM
all the liverpool goals are absolute materclass.
Muted
Great game. But ruined  by the 2 ladys commentating.. I watched  it live today.
Cracking game ruined by a woman commentator
It's embarrassing and laughable that there isn't just one, but two women commenting on the men's game. Wokeism has gone awry.
MacCalister,  take a bow aswell son
Dead commentary
TA showing how to blood his new Adidas Predator boots.
Looks like Darwin has his har done by Stevei wonder hairdresser
Would’ve been even better with better commentary, but what a game
This game was full of everything what a win we got!! 🎉🥂
You dont appreciate just how good Allison is until he's not there, Kelleher wouldnt be there if he's that bad, just a bad day in the office and understandable considering so little game time especially in thrillers like that today.
Goal liverpool semua lawa bodo😭
Trent is becoming one of my all time favorite Liverpool players. what a talent.
Also all of our goals were absolute beauty’s😍
Take a bow Alexander Arnold. Take a bow son
*Let us play a game of Where ' s Wally*  Who in the comments can put a time stamp on the police officer in green that bemoans a goal going in?  1...2...3...GO!
Mute
What happens when our defence that usually has the best keeper in the world surely gets injured and his back up is leagues below the standard we have been custom too. Ali saves two of those easily
TAA is disgustingly good
Woeful performance by Kelleher but bench rust will do that to you! He’ll be back to his best in no time I’m sure! And Macca’s goal! Got to be one of the best goals I’ve seen in a long time at Anfield.
reece james  who???
Not a great start for the Liverpool gk
Good coverage from the commentary booth for once
good game but the female commentator is so bad
Unbelievable geoff!😂 TTA what a player🤩 scouser through and through❤️
Got to love Liverpool definitely the neutrals favourite
Liverpool keeper doesn't cover himself in glory does he
Never seen every goal from one team be all absolute screamers. Unbelievable.
Liverpool really said “Yeah, let’s make every goal a screamer”
better with commentary off 😂
4 fantastic goals
if you just start watching from 2:35 on mute, you wouldn't know whether it was TAA or Nunez that scored lol
I think a lot of people do
Pien on comms is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trent is world class, so glad he’s a Red! 💪🏽💪🏽
Sorry, commentary was crap
Endo should start sometimes with Mac in a position to do damage with szoboslai, rotate between endo and Ryan, not every game is for Ryan imo
Ticking of the old boxes continues
Liverpool only scoring screamers 😱
When we went behind I thought we was done my how wrong I was and glad I was but Liverpool as much as I love you do ya have to stress me out like that damn
Goosebumps
YES!
If Liverpool rest grav from time to time you can see more of these goals from Mac and endo, two great prem debut goals
Commentary kills how good Liverpools goals where
Trent’s free kick! ❤
Her voice 😖
What do people think about Silva commenting about Tsimikas "foul" on Reid for Pools 4th goal? Surely you'd say if that's a foul then it's also a foul by Reid on Tsimikas for Fulham's 3rd?
All Liverpool goals were insane
Leno man 💔💔💔💔💔
Haaland watching this be like😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Who noticed that before TAA's goal went in (the last goal) he was already turning to celebrate. Dude trusts in his accuracy BIG TIME!
Way to score the goal of the season and the commentator couldn't care less.
Electric game this big shots for Liverpool
Not sure if i’ve ever seen 4 better goals being scored by one team in one game, absolutely great strikes. Take a bow Macallister, somehow took the shine from Trent’s freekick..
It's deffo the Trim Trent 😂
Fulham,bloody non-stop. Lfc kept going + more.that was the difference.
trent is our most important player no debate about it. hes more important than salah dont care what anyone says
Liverpool are contenders
I actually hate myself so much. Turned the game off at 3-2, I was fuming. I wish I could have a more positive outlook when things seem bad.
2 gots contenders but theyre not even going to get close 😂
Volume turned down
Ruined by the commentator, listen to your audience sky
You need the clock in the top corner: literally no sense of the urgency that was felt watching the game live.
Was this a goal of the month compilation I clicked on by accident?
Why are there women commentating on games now??
I went to this match today and there was a undercover fulham fan who got kicked out😂
All 4 goals ruined by femal commentary. Does anyone have the male commentary version please.?
Sensational goal for all Liverpool goals
YOU GOTTA HAND IT to her she’s a fantastic commentator!!
Commentator is a nightmare. Don’t need that in Mens football cheers
What a rollercoaster of a game. Endo made a huge impact for the comeback and Trent was fantastic. Super happy for Mac Allister with the best goal of the lot
Premier league just keeps giving!
I dont think i have ever seen better 4 goals by one team in a game
great game, awful commentary
A great game with the sound off.
Can’t win with Klopp setting up a team to be so open. Klopp out if you want more success and not mostly runners up
LIVERPOOL SCORING 4 BANGERS!!!!!!
Liverpool doing the bangers only challenge 😂
can't stand the commentary
Thank god I watch with the Arabic commentary
Women pundits and commentators should  be barred from the Premier League, abysmal is putting it mildly , stick to the WSL or netball.
…smashing commentary…👌🏻…
Its gonna be one of those seasons i tell ya!
I know we made the comeback and what a comeback it was but from that game we can see the danger we have in the gK position ever since Alisson got injured, we can’t have Kellher in goal if we’re in a title race
Kelleher had a stinker, was so promising earlier in his career. Not done himself any favours
Best match I’ve ever seen😮
Liverpool scoring absolute bangers today🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great game highlights ruined by screaming female commentators, sky are finished trying to fill boxes rather than give us memorable and proper commentary on an incredible match like this
Goal keeper was poor
Kelleher needs to be doing better, same woth the defence, but what 4 outstanding goals hard to pick the best one, im gonnango with macalisters goal
They didn’t give Trent the free kick goal?? Bit harsh to call it an OG
Crazy kelleher guilty of all three goals , put Adrian in goal now
No disrespect to Kelleher … but Alisson stops all 3 of their goals
We're definitely not title challengers
S
I'm a Liverpool fan but you have to agree the mac allister goal was best of the season better than garnachow
I still can’t bear to hear women commentary on men’s football  It just sounds like such forced enthusiasm when a goal is scored
It’s better muted
Wow. All Liverpool goals were superb
Great goals from liverpool, but how was that not a foul on the fulham cb just before the last goal 😂
Wow
Had to watch that with the sound down
As an Irishman it was difficult to see Kelliher let in x3 soft goals, he wont get a better chance then this period to try and take the no1 shirt
fully deserved for macca, so much stupid hate even tho hes playing in the wrong position for him. i love him.
I mean Trent and endos goals were good but that macallister goal was unbelievable
strange game it felt like a loss.
Alexander Arnold what a free kick
All bangers
Hate saying this as a Liverpool fan, but with Allison in goal it's 4-1 right. I'm sure Kelleher won't be happy with 2 of those goals either
Even if you lead 3:0 against Liverpool and its minute '90 you're still not safe!
Liverpool look terrible at the back.
Kelleher just warming up 💚💯🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
meanwhile everyone else scoring boring tap in goals, and here is us smashing in worldies left right and centre! tough game, 100% missing Alisson, but got the job done
Worst commentator ever spoils the highlights
Szoboszlai has a huge impact on Trent. It's obvious that he found himself again.
Why are their 2 women commentators
the commentator is dire
What a game, the quality of the goals was something else. Well done both teams for dishing up such a spectacle.
Quadruple must be back on is it? Hahaha settle lads
Some great goals. Am I the only one who noticed the blatant foul on the Fulham player as he was going to clear the ball with a header for the 4th Liverpool goal?
And…..watch in mute
Can't stand women commenters.
Fair play to liverpool
The woman commentator is taking away the excitement from those goals tbf,wheres martin tyler in his prime when u need him
MacAllister scored a oud lad contender and Arnold is world class. Im a hater. Liverpool only win due to individual brilliance. Gg Fullham
Bye bye Kellagher, enjoy your career in league 1
The woman commentor is hurting my ears
2019/2020 we beat Palace in a similar crazy game and we didn't do too bad that season...
Four super goals. Love it
What a game. And with Horrid Henry and Perfect Peter on commentary to top it all off🔥.
Magnificent Trent and Mac and Endo!
Did they really have two women commentating this game?
fulham have the only fans that sit down away
Bloody hell. And to think the first 2 goals by Fulham would’ve probably been saved by Alisson if he were here. But let’s not take away from the fact that Liverpool had all the pressure from constantly Fulham being 1 goal behind to level and then being a goal ahead, yet they never gave up and performed probably our best game of the season! Well done you Reds!
What a wonderful comeback win✌️ Mentality Monster💪
Some great goals but I can't ignore what looked like an absolutely blatant foul by Tsimikas on the Fulham defender on the last goal.
Liverpool have used up their season allocation of worldies to beat Fulham at home.
I don’t think you’ll ever see 4 better goals in a game ever again 4 screamers
All this game was missing was a male commentator
Ashamed to say, I turned off in a mood when fulham went 3-2. I believe we won because of this, you're all welcome :)
Commentator ruined that winning goal
Trent Amazing Arnold 🔥🔥🔥
Should have been a free out to Fulham for 4th Goal.. blatant push in back.
How was Liverpool's first goal called as an OG?  The keeper is nowhere near getting a touch on it!  That's Trent's goal 100%!  Kelleher at fault for first two Fulham goals (Allison saves those) and VVD should never be outjumped at the back post for the third.  Three ridiculous goals to give away, but the quality we have now in midfield won the day for us.  COYR!  YNWA!
Some game!
Turned down volume on this. Couldn’t take the female commentators. Felt like one of them was trying too hard.
Dunno how to say this without being sexist but the women commentary ruins this
The 4 goal shouldn't have stood it was a foul all day
I know Alexander Arnold is special but to strike it like that right at the end of the match with so much power is extra special 🤜🏿
Commentators are dry
4 goals for liverpool today. 4 bangers for liverpool today.
2:30 how's that not a free out?
I'm an Arsenal fan, but why were all of Liverpool's goals genuinely INSANE?!
We need to keep the momentum and keep winning
Liverpool really lucky today. Good job the ref was on their side for the forth goal...
We are Red💪💪💪💪💪💪
That must have been a beast of game looks like Liverpool was only aiming for screamers😂
Wow 7 goals these highlights should be good  >Female commentator  Never mind.
Mute the game for a better experience 😊
This, in the end, is what you might call a bonus win.
That 4th goal for Liverpool as great as it was, was probably the lowest ranked of the 4. Unbelievable strikes in there today, well done Liverpool 👌
All of Liverpool's goals deserved far far better commentary.
I hate females commentating on the man's game.
It’s like the Liverpool players were competing to see who could score the best worldy.
Never seen four goals of that quality in one game fulham made them work for it though. PL is on 🔥 this year..
What the games today.  4:3 to Liverpool and 3:3 draw City and Spurs, but Man U will probably have more columns tomorrow in Daily Mail.
special moments ruined by the commentary
To score four goals like that in a single game is phenomenal. Fair play to Liverpool
The mentality monsters are back!
appalling commentary
jesus what a set of goals
Good game, shame about the commentators.
0:19  that was a classy goal
Can barely watch the highlights here with those commentators.  Can't imagine what 90 minutes would be like.
Bad enough 1 woman commentator but 2. Why can't they just commentate on there own crap game. Had to play the highlights with the sound off. You never get men commentating on the women's poor game.
it’s clear to see when allison don’t play
I'm not a Liverpool fan but 4 cracking goals like these deserve the 3 Points
Great game which is ruined by the commentary. Awful!
2 woman commentators 😅 I can't take it seriously 😂
INSANE ARNOLD DUBBLE
Please turn off the commentary my ears are bleeding
What incredible goals today's Liverpool players scored. I wish we had played like that from the beginning, but we got what we wanted. The Liverpool players showed enthusiasm and began pushing the other squad towards the end. This game made Alison's importance clear to us. And Trent is a true Liverpool legend—what a lovely boy, I genuinely like him. Ynwa❤
Fulham got robbed. That's a foul by Tsimikas on Fulham RB. They were so lucky should have finish 3-3. 😂
Commentary muted. Absolutely horrific
Great game great goals weird how no one has questioned a foul by tsimikas on reid for the last goal or that var didnt check it
Terrible defending, Terrible goalkeeping but four quality goals and three points. 👍
Trent he’s got to be the best player in the world and Liverpool will win the premier league as they’re the best team right now in the league
Best attacking midfield in the world, absolute masterclass from macallister trent and endo ❤️
TAA very much! Brilliant ! Mo is creating the vital assists. Keep improving eh?
Another dull game at Anfield !
Not knocking the young lad but Allison would have kept a clean sheet
I was there best game of my life ynwa
My God that commentator was awful, almost as bad as the Liverpool goalie
Was that two female commentators in one game. Jesus haha
Playing awful doesn’t matter if you get 4 screamers I guess
Commentators are rubbish
Great win, but Kelleher is not good enough to deputise for Alisson.
Dem adidas boots gave Trent power safe
Can’t stand women commentating
Liverpools 4 goals 👌
Liverpool playing like they got sliders on, only bangers
Wow
So pleased for Endo to come on and start the revival ❤️
forget the game... look at those fulham limbs going a goal up at anfield with 10 mins to go. embarrasing support
Credit to Fulham what a game, I honestly don't think the score line would be the same with Alisson in goal, the first 2 are savable for sure.
both keepers were awful
All Liverpool's goals were world class....this is the stuff of teams intent on winning the Premiership.....never say die
How Trents first goal is not attributed to him is beyond me.
Kelleher won't be starting anymore prem games when Alisson is back after that
That’s the Liverpool we feared
Not queveens  best day. A little bit on the dodgy side.
Liverpool only score bangers!
This game shows us how much Allison saves us
That trent free kick is absolutely nutty
All four of Liverpool’s goals were WORLD CLASS 👏 👏 👏
The female commentary does not do these goals justice.
The goals from Liverpool were so good today it made the guys doing the commentary sound really feminine.
Allison have stopped those first two Fulham goals no problem, Kelleher can be hit or miss.  Great 3 points.
Some game, had to listen in mute but incredible.
Seems every time Liverpool score a stunning goal, Fulham would in return poke one through Kellehers leg's.
Now that’s TAAs celebration 😂
Wonderful game. Crap commentary.
Only thing bad about this game was the commentator
Incase anyone doubted liverpool are title contenders. Resilience.
Cant believe  how insane all of them Liverpool goals were 😮
Trent masterclass
The goal of the month is gonna be tough…
Good luck picking goal of the month, shame that Garnacho's was last month now but the sheer amount of stunners we are getting in the prem this season is mental. We also have 1 or 2 amazing games per week, it's brill
4 brilliant strikes from liverpool
Fighting spirit from Liverpool is unreal wish man utd could even show an ounce of it
Great goals aside, Trent’s passing was from another world today. 🔥
2 female commentators
we robbed this today with scoring 4 screamers, come on you reds !!
All of Liverpool's goals were bangers.
Shout out to all the Liverpool fans who were singing louder when they went down 3-2 late in the game.  There’s your famous atmosphere.
Trent the goat
Yeh but Trent can’t defend 😂
Two female commentators making the match twice as unlistenable.
Am sorry.but this game was great to watch.but women doing the commentary made the game sound Sunday league.pls stop this bulls**t😡😡🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Why do we have 2 women’s commentators on a men’s premier league game. Bizarre.
Also, last goal for Liverpool, there was a clear foul I'm the box, you can't jump into the back of a player
All of Liverpools goals were absolutely stunning. P.s the commentary was shite.
If Trent could improve his all round game, he’d be Bellingham levels of talent.
Some awful goalkeeping by Kelleher, not having Ali between the sticks will cost us against better teams. Also two women commentators 😐😐😐
As a Fulham FC fan I was happy with the way we played. To actually lead you at one point is more than what i would expect, but like always the final minutes of the game was a let down for us. Well done Liverpool 👏 was a great game to watch 😊
Awful commentary
Going on about onana goal keeping
Who run the world... girls, girls!! 😂
Class performance... UPTF YNWA
We literally said banger only
As a man united fan I would give trent motm because of of his two goals and his sensational performance absolute legend!
keeper was shocking 2 easy goals against us
What a brilliant performance by both team's. Once again Trent scored the winner. I hope Liverpool doesn't let him go . This boy is a class player who scores goals and wins games.
Why are there female commentators?
Endo n trent Mac wow what a ladw🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉we Are LFC something special
Typically Fulham to lead with 10 to go and lose. The pain of supporting thos club.
Two great goals from Liverpool's 6s.
Sound off....... That's better.
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. YNWA.
That there, is the difference it makes having Alisson in the net. 2 of the Fulham goals would have been saved and Liverpool would have strolled it.
Liverpool were not playing around with their goals today.
Trent for ballondor
Looked a great match in the highlights but wasn't. Liverpool  defence dire.
Nothing but bangers
This is very reminiscent of that 5-4 crazy game vs Norwich early in Klopp’s reign
How the hell can the premiere league take that 1st off trent ?? The goalie never touched the ball.
instead, we watched palace and West Ham. need I say more
Well done Liverpool for the four quality goals, McAllister goal will boost his confidence, onto the next boys, ynwa
Not convinced with kellheller
the game needs my screeching from commentators imo.
Im sorry but we needed a different Commentator for this game
Four absolute STUNNERS from the reds. ❤
Aliison please come back quick
I don't like female commenting.....its grinding on the ears
Maybe entertaining to watch. Doesn't take away the fact that Liverpool played their get out of jail card again!
Female commentators are pants....
Wow we need Alisson back as soon as possible
3 goals in 2 games for Trent, he’s been really great atm, keep it going.
Trent start whater trent finish
Well done Fulham showed some fight for once COYW if we can beat the smaller teams like that then we will be fine this season
Missed Allison today
Mac Allister goal the pick of the bunch
can we respect how hard fulham tried huge respect to them
Great goals spoilt by the commentary.
God her commentary is shite.
4 superb Liverpool goals!
Trent is a cm 🔥
Football 🤷‍♂️
Why are women commentating?
Commentary made my ears bleed
Goal of the month sorted out all in this match
All four goals were cracking goals. Our GK though is awful, Alisson would have saved most of those
All four goals were cracking goals. Our GK though is awful, Alisson would have saved most of those
Fantastic game with great goals, but the Liverpool 4th shouldn't have stood - clear foul on Decordova-Reid. VAR always gives decisions to the richer teams.
What a goal
Such a great game ruined by the commentators 😔
Wow! Looks like the Liverpool lads are competing for goal of the month 😅🔥
2 female commentators?? The game is finished
kelleher is no where near as good as Alisson
Can’t be doing with the commentary though.
We might be getting the first 3 horse title race. This is the sign of champions not a draw a late winner and they also beat a quality Newcastle side away with 10 MEN 👀🔥
Long Shot FC vs Fulham today
You just know Trent felt like Gerrard with that winner 😂
Every goal from liverpool was a banger...enjoyable game but we gave away 2 silly goals..need to tighten up at the back..YNWA
Exceptional come back! I feel better for next week Team
Why can't we have male football commentators?  Just taking away the passion from our game. This game was amazing and the atmosphere was top level, but the commentators sound like drab AI drones.
It's games like this that win titles. All 4 Liverpool goals were STUNNING ❤
As any fan of any club..first thing you want is to win...but all fans in football want to be entertained. I would honestly rather watch that game than a 4.0 against spurs..it was end to end..worldies and tap-ins. Obviously Klopp will be annoyed we let in 3.. Had we lost I'd also be annoyed..but we always look like we can score when we want. Credit to Fulham they came to play.
Even the female commentator was entertaining haha
3 goals conceded against lower opposition at Anfield.  Good game for the spectatator..
Its unfair to record Trents first goal as an OG.
What more is there to say about trent, just absolutely unreal. very happy with the win but the mistakes will be our undoing if they carry on, so sloppy giving the ball away on the first goal, nunez NEEDS to start putting these chances away, diaz has been great for us recently so i don't wanna be harsh but he was wasteful today. conceding 3 to fulham at anfield when they're not great defensively is poor. happy to get the win though.
Liverpool probably shouldn't have conceded the goals they did but the goals they scored were awesome. And Trent is a phenomenal player.
No cobwebs on those goals 😂
Wow all 4 of liverpool goals were absolute bangers
That has to be the best mach of the season 🥶
unbelievable goals from liverpool
Nowt worse than women commentators...Ruins the game... Stick to sewing ladies...
Female commentator dosent give any of the class goals justice
Kelleher looked lost today! All 3 of those goals would have been easy saves for Allison. Chin up son go again next week!
^Playing FIFA with the distant shooting accuracy maxxed out^
I have to give credit to those Fulham fans who applauded Mac Allister's goal.
Gerrard would have been proud of that belter from Mac Allister. 4 brilliant goals from Liverpool.
sell mo salah. waste of money. can't score anymore
Would have been a travesty had Fulham got anything from that game. Liverpool fully deserved all three points today.
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL COMMENTARY TEAM 🤢
Did salah play 😂
Bosh, Amazing, Sick, Fantastic, what more do you want me to say?
Kelleher is not a shot stopper plain and simple.
2 goals of the season + 2 excellent strikes in one game ?  Unbelievable  !
As a Fulham fan, we put up a valiant fight. Yet, that McAllister and Trent goals may have been the best I’ve ever seen scored against us
Think that's what we have been missing for years not enough shots and goals from outside the box  Some world class strikes today 👏
I don’t think we should have women commentators
Trent is the best right back in the world. No debate.
Liverpool decied to score 3 Puskas nominee goals
Trent with a true Gerrard moment and match of his own. Goosebumps.
What a game! Felt bad for Kelleher though!
I honestly thought we'd have to settle for 3-3 draw , but this Liverpool team just wont lie down  what a comeback,  what a team , what a manager.
From a Utd fan i can say what a game , well done Liverpool for digging in and playing til the final whistle well deserved, some great goals. Pity my shite team can't watch this and take a little on board. !!
This is why football is so good
This game was crazy. We're woeful without Allison in goal tbh
Did you really expect tap ins when the classic predators have just dropped
4 absolute belter goals to pick us up and celebrate like crazy each time
Liverpool let in 3 weak goals today with a poor defence?? . But scored 4 stunning long shot goals. Well done.
honoured to be there today honestly what an atmosphere in the last 10 minutes absolutely mental
Every goal we scored was a banger 👌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
What a match. Great goals
Female commentators are terrible
na man nooo bloodclott golie keeper going to save dat rasclatt finish ye hear mee,bumboclatt✌🏻💯😂
Even though we lost, proud of the lads performance today COYW
Nobody gonna talk about kelleher’s positioning? That headed goal from Reid more specifically 😳 he was at least 5ft out of position. Defensively we weren’t the best but realistically we only conceded as many as we did due to kelleher’s mistakes/lack of ability in comparison to Alison. It’s a shame, kelleher knows himself that he’s better than todays performance
Imagine having an all male commentary team on a women's match, would go down like a lead balloon
Why  are there woman commentator.. Ruins the game..
Stunning comeback at home against the mighty Fulham 🤣
Commentary is awful for such a good game... This equal opportunities nonsense has ruined entertainment!
Can’t abide that commentator…….watched it again with the sound off
Sorry but kelleher is dogshit why are we playing him in the league
sky pushing feminist agenda.
How Trent’s free kick has been given as an own goal is beyond me!
Just out of the stadium. Absolute mental game. The Reds just never give in. Never beaten till were beaten 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I’m a big fan of Liverpool
How did we defend so badly
That defence is awful, if we can tighten it we can win the prem with the strikers
WOW
4 brilliant goals by Liverpool
Nunez days likely numbered. He's getting worse imo. One of the best non scoring strikers in the league.  Misses a lot of sitters. Allison in goal might have saved all 3.  Kelleher is good enough a ball stopper to be first choice for a decent team but he preferred to be at Liverpool albeit on the bench for years. He's had so few meaningful games you can see he's lost an edge. None of the 3 goals was 100% unstoppable. There's a reason why most clubs have a seasoned decent goalie on the bench.
If Alison is playing it’s 4-0
Nice diverse commentary team for this game.
Kelleher nearly cost us today them both goals should of been saved macallister was also to blame on the first one aswell I hope Allison comes back quick
Trent is the most underrated player ever. If he was Brazilian they would build the team around him.
1:24
aLL the goals were bangers
2:55 mins for 7 goals and don’t even show the disallowed goal for Fulham 🤦🏼‍♂️
Endo should be starting now more games
Alison badly missed
Every liverpool goal was spectacular ❤ get in the red men🎉
all the goal of the month nominees in the same match.
Don't forget the foul  in the lead up to the goal
Gotta say, Fulham’s goalie should have gone to specsavers😱
The only thing what ruin this game was two women commentating
Not even three full mins like what a joke should be giving these games atleast 6 7 mins of highlights instead if the usual three mins joke
Women commentator MUTE
VVD got exposed yet again, a poor man's Silva
Trent Trent oh Trent what have you done? That free kick stinks 🔥🔥🔥
4 goals 4 screamers
crazy how liverpool only scored screamers
And all they will say is Trent could have defended better! Absolute agenda against him. Hes class
They saying the taa  first goal is an own goal! That's a load of bull crappy
That Mac Allister goal...wow...
I really enjoyed every single LFC goal but what a nightmare our goalkeeper had. hope we get Alisson back quick
Watching it muted
Liverpool had 10 men. The goalkeeper disgrace
Didn’t have this on TV just so you could have two female commentators on?
I’m a Chelsea fan (as you can see from my pfp) but I have respect for Liverpool.  Today despite conceding some dodgy goals, their goals in response were class
Trent is literally reminding me of stevie G days at Anfield pushing liverpool across the line
Is Allison injured ? Feel like score would’ve been less against Liverpool if Allison was playing or just giving other keeper a chance?
Is it just me who thinks Mo Salah is so consistant with goal contributions.
Have to watch this on mute.
Garnachos bicycle kick or trents free kick
WOW! Every Liverpool goal was a screamer.
2.55 minutes highlights for a 7 goal 98min game
Why female commentators though?
What a game this was, had my adrenaline high the entire time (whilst playing fifa)
Great game but this commentary needs to stop it awful she is not good and i have not watched games because she is commentating it’s awful
She has the worst voice I've ever heard
What a goal from Alexander- Arnold!!!!!😊😊😊
Alexander just knows where to put the ball.
God, that commentary pierces your ears, doesn't it? 🙄
I think Liverpool will win Premier League Title! City will falter this year die to Champs League focus, an Arsenal distraction. Liverpool will coast Europa League n focus on Premier League.🙏
and this game was absolute chaos
Why the women commentators
My word what a match, I think the adrenaline has only just worn off!!!
Commentary ruins this video obviously
Big Mac strike was so sweet😊
Conceding 3 at home to Fulham isn't something to be happy about... Maybe consider taking lessons from Eric Dier?
that 2nd equaliser from fulham...
Gary neville said it "hes not just any right back, hes thee right back"
that trent goal to make it 4-3 was like  a strikers finish, not many could finish from there especially with so little time to go
You can't score 4 stunning goals and then lose😂
what frustrates me rn is that we should be level with city on points. that tottenham game has put us in a pickle. Kelleher needs to be given the BOD for this game hes played excellent when we've seen him on the pitch. trent has been mythical this season. endo getting the ropes, darwizzy needs to be used as a super sub, when ever he comes on as a sub he performs, overall good game score should have been 4-2 if the gk didn't make mistakes.
They put down the first goal as own goal 😢
4 absolute cracker goals from Liverpool. What a game!
Got to agree with Kevin Keegan, female commentry just does not come across that well.
Worldie FC
defensively we need to get sorted out, kellher is a good keeper but no where as good as allison, well done liverpool, keep going got sheffield and utd coming up in the prem. u s g in europa and to top it all off start new year arsenal 3rd rnd fa cup.
Liverpool game plan today was to only score bangers 🫣🤣😉👍
Calling the free kick an own goal by the keeper is ridiculous!  Even IF the ball brushed his shoulder after hitting the bar, it was going in regardless, so was no different to a deflection which isn't classed as an own goal!  You only class a goal as an own goal if the defending players' contact with the ball changed its' path enough to where the shot went in when it wouldn't have besides!  That was 100% a goal scored by Arnold, so two scored by him in the game! 😯😀🤘 .
Trent was absolutely incredible
Endo weirdly resembles to Gini. I think we have our replacement. At least of the time being.
The worst thing about this game was the. Cometary
Liverpool scored 4 absolute bangers
Womens commentary is shite sorry
Can someone explain why the first goal was Keeper own goal..
It's a good job Liverpool know how to score because there defence is shocking
The commentary lol
Why do we need female commentator in men's game?
Had to turn the sound down….enough to make the ears bleed
glad for trent takes a lot of stick for his defending
We gonna need our strikers to be on form.....Kelleher is just not Allison.
They need sack klopp now
Fulham so unlucky...
Trents free kick going down as an own goal just feels mean
Unlucky Leno. Not many keepers could have saved the Trent free-kick and Mac Allister's rocket shot.
Why have a commentator with no excitement
Sorry Sky, but women commentators just don't work when it comes to football.
Are we just not gonna talk abt Darwin's hair 💀
Great goal Trent… but every Fulham goal came down the right your right 😂😂😂
I love this club so much man! What a bunch of warriors
Fantastic fantastic fantastic
Kelleher is trash
YNWA
@Forever Fulham shhhhhh
Love Trent. Generational.
What a game but that commentary is dreadful. Completely killed the hype of watching this. Get some proper commentators on.
Sorry but I wish they’d pick match commentators with a broadcast friendly voice. NOT screechers…
Trent should move into midfield and Liverpool should buy a new RB
Phenomenal Goals from a Phenomenal Team LFC Come On!
Liverpool only scored bangers🔥🔥
Game of the season contender
Mac alister wow what a goal
All spectacular strikes for LFC.
The Fulham strategy was to restrict Liverpool to shooting from distance. That’s fine by me! 😊
Exciting match but Liverpool's defence is all over the place with that box midfield leaving a huge gap in that RB area and their defenders not really being able to win the aerial balls. They can't rely on 4 worldie goals each week to win games. They need to think of a better defensive solution.
trent needs to play in midfield to show his true greatness he can hurt any team with shots passing etc
I see they’ve been taking lessons from SEAL team 6❤️ Sniper FC
Alison would have saved at least two of their goals.
Fantastic fantastic fantastic
Kelleher belongs in League One, not as a #2 for Liverpool
Such a great game, shame it had to be ruined by that shite commentator
I knew it was Trent’s hair’s fault. If Salah cuts his...well I don’t want this think about what would happen...
It would if been better highlights to watch if we didnt have someone commentating with such a high pitched voice 🙄🙄🙄🙄
God Liverpool need a decent second, goalkeeper because he is rubbish. The last Liverpool goalkeeper to be so bad as he is Mike hooper
Liverpool goalkeeper should have done better
Our Argentine has to be one of the goals of the season already.
Trent playing in predator boots is a cheat code , Liverpool won 4-3 playing no goalkeeper 🤣🤣
Shame I had to watch this muted with the women commentary
Endo is the greatest 6 in the league i will keep saying this
3 out of 4 Liverpool goals were in the upper 90 bro its ridiculous
I think sometimes we need to be called houdineis instead of reds
WOW. SUPER GOALS
That’s a proper team
What a goal from Mac allister
Why women commentary???? Let the man do their job
Liverpool still unbeaten in premier league
7 goals and under 3 mins. Sky sports always just too lazy with the highlights.
When is Allison back?  2 out of 3 conceded goals should have been saved by the GK.
Anything on target is a goal. Go look at the 4-4 with Southampton last season. This keeper is no better than Adrian & will cost us points. Its Karius all over again.
I take it the male commentators were all busy??
what a game
Good game but this is honestly horrible from a supposed title contenting Liverpool. How are they letting in 3 goals at home to a relegation team? Bizarre!
I’ve said he will come good strong. Guy  take no nonsense Japanese player got bottle ⚡️
A joke to give such a great first goal the OG to Leno
The goals from Liverpool today were crazy
Wataru Endo should start on every game cause he is work horse keeps on going the whole game
I know it may seem weird that we are clutching against Fulham but that last 10 minute double was incredible and came back from losing 😮‍💨✨️💯
What goals from Liverpool !!!😮 You need scorers like that if a team gonna have any chance of winning big things (trophies), not even a Liverpool fan.
These two dying cats on commentary have ruined these highlights
Screamers ruined by female commentators. Stop it.
I’m an Arsenal fan, but it feels like Liverpool could win the league this season. They need their keeper back urgently though.
Salah missed one sitter, nunez two. Its not a good day for liverpool forwards, but luckily their midfield step up and scored wonder goals
Com on sky where are the male commentators
We need a spare keeper …we were lucky today .come on boys ynwa
How many 'hold my beer' goals do you want in 1 game? 😂
Worst commentary
I’m fed up with these female commentators, utter crap.
Trent motm
What's the point in showing us VAR when the goal stood? Show us more football instead!
“Where’s the bloke?” “Yeah, where’s the bloke?”
4 wonder goals isn’t sustainable and that’s a foul for the last goal, 10x’s more contact than the Allison VAR decision the other day, I think Liverpool will drop off when events go against them
That second from Trent and his celebration was Gerrard-esque
These female commentator’s are shocking 🤣🤣🤣🤣
3 amazing goals by liverpool 1 great goal in trents second mcallister is competint for goal of the season now along with mudryk and garnacho what a strike
This was the best game we have had the best goals in our history even know we have the best history up the reds YNWA
Liverpool are conceding far too many goals . If someone can explain why the winning goal was not disallowed for a foul in the buildup .
Trent’s first goal put down as an own goal online 🤯🤬
I hate to say it, because Kelleher is well liked by everyone that supports lfc, but Kelleher needs to do better with the first two goals. Having said that, we should not be losing the ball the way we had for the first and need to be more assertive when defending set pieces.  Cracking goals by lfc to win this game 👏
Honestly Liverpool should go to a 3-4-3 formation have 3 big quick center strong backs and have Trent play Right Midfield. It will sort out alot of their problems .
What worldie goals lol,
Is that two women commentating 😂😂
Kelleher is awful
Unbelievable Jeff!
ugh the commentary
MacAllister 🚀
Some of the craziest goals i have ever seen in my life from liverpool
2 women commentators on a men's game. Are they there because they're good commentators? Or is it because broadcasters are forcing to have an X number of "diverse" commentators on games?
Trent was absolutely world class for Liverpool today
Female commentators are the unwanted Xmas gifts that are returned in the new year!
I'm a huge lfc fan but I thought it was a foul just before the TAA 4th goal 🧐
I’m sorry but she should be nowhere near a microphone. Yet again political correctness ruins everything.
Some cracking goals in this game, the atmosphere at end when Liverpool won it was something else 💥
How on Earth was that a Leno own goal
Love it
How is the given that as a leno own goal
Kelleher is so bad
Worst commentating I've heard in my life...I gotta watch another version now
Refuse to sit and listen to two women commentators
Red Football.
Boss goals off us I'd rather have shots outside the box if the area is over crowded if it rebounds out it could be a tap in good game for a neutral for a red nerve wracking.up the mighty reds
Shocking defending by Liverpool
That was dramatic..could have done without that screeching woman sound which was thankfully drowned out by the passion of the crowd.
Come back Ali 🤦🤦
endo  and trent and more are world class through this season respect for liverpool 😱😱😱
Macca goal took my breath away. Deserved the win, but we have to do better at times.
How did Trent not get awarded the first goal?
Trent in midfield + Bellingham would’ve been unbeatable   Which makes your question why England still haven’t won anything?  Southgate is really that much of a brick
Who decided it was a good idea to let 2 female commentators do the game? 🤦‍♂️
A fantastic game of football was provided today by both teams here at Anfield... While they gave both sets of fans some classic heavy metal end to end football... But when you have wonder goals being blasted in as well... Rather than simple tap-in's... You've been treated to some genuine fantasy football... Well done to both teams for playing their part in such a classic game. 👍
Brilliant from Liverpool today with some outstanding goals but lets be honest, the normally reliable and occasionally excellent Kelleher was $hit today. Schoolboy fumbling which is a shame because in the past he's been quite good. The scoreline overly flatters Fulham from what really was a classy drubbing and shouldn't undervalue Liverpool's performance overall.
What a great win but but are defence worrys me
Commentary is so much shitter when women do it !
All of liverpools goals were class
All 4 liverpool goals are class🔥especially loving Trent’s play at the minute
Been looking forward too seeing these highlights. Utterly ruined by the crap as commentator.. how is she getting paid too be so bad…
LFC GOALIE CMON BRO.
Wot a game cm9n the mighty pool
Nunez at the end 😂
Needs to be said Kelleher isn't good enough.
Liverpool pretty much scored 4 goal of the month award nominees
How can they call that first goal a own    Goal
Salah is crazy, runs for the ball after endo equalised. What a player.
Someone tell me, was Kelleher as bad as the goals made him look
Scandalous that Trent's free was given as an OG!
Commentators sound like they are on testosterone tablets.
Woman cannot commentate games like this so anticlimactic 😂😂
Who are the two prepubescent teen lads on commentary? Nice to see young lads getting a chance, even though it reminds me of when me and my friends at nine years old would replay games and do commentary on them. Good on these young lads.
You know Trent is on his Gerrard vibes in the preds to finish the day off with the belly slide then aswell
some of the sexiest goals i've ever seen x
AA may score the odd goal but don't let that deflect from the fact he is a terrible defender, he simply cannot defend, too many times today Fulham players just ran by him and this happens every week. He's can't tackle and more often than not he's caught napping as he's unaware of those around him. He's behind most of Liverpool's defensive problems.
Every goal was amazing 🤫🔥
Darwin Nunez change your hairstyle! U and my sister have the same hair lol
Wow!! Best game today and NOT shown live on TV 📺 who made that decision??
Liverpool scoring bangers only 🔥
What a match and credit Fulham they gave us a match! Great win! YNWA!
Aww look at the excited Reds, so jubilant that they might get into the Champions League next season lol
Quality game... horrendous commentators
What a win by Liverpool  mentality of a team its tuned top notch fight till last minute all goals by Liverpool top class  and Trent recently is unbelievable great game congratulations to Klopp and Lads well done YNWA
Can anyone explain why Trents free kick was a Leno own goal?
Fulham made Liverpool work for all four goals, but Liverpool rose to the challenge!
Leno couldn't do anything about any of those shots
Vamos Ale que golazooo!!!, 💪💪 An absolute rocket! What a beauty! fitting for a world cup winner, c'mon!!
Lovely
Amazing come back from the lads and some world class strikes today but we really have to sort out our defending if we are going to make a title bid this season ❤YNWA❤
Top commentary on these highlights. Liverpool, they're not scoring tap-ins today 🤘🏼
Alison would of saved all 3 of Fulham’s goal kellther was awful aswel as the defending
GOOSE. BUMPS.
Those new preds are working a treat for Trent
can never count Liverpool out, they always come back
Kelleher could’ve done better, but four beautiful goals ❤❤ top class
Liverpool fan here,well done Reds. 4 fantastic goals but well done Fulham, best team at Anfield this season. Keep playing like that and who knows what can happen
And this is why Alisson is liverpools number 1...
No liverpool front 3 scored today.  All from  outside the box
Yeah I think Trent was pretty chuffed.
Will mo salah score his 200 goal at anfield it will be a shame if he didn't 4 goals today even not on the score sheet
TAA is the best player in the league right now
Liverpool were just having their own goal of the month competition
I dont know why women are commentating im sorry but I just dont think they are nowhere near good enough, they are taking away from the excitement of the game, people should be able to choose which commentary they want women or fellas, women are a damp squib...
You’ve gotta take your hat off to Fulham here,, played some lovely football!! Individual brilliance was the difference
Manu beat them one nil 😅
Jammy redshite no one likes the kopites get back on the ferry where you all belong, its never your fault
Have to watch that with sound off with her horrible screaming commentary
Did this game have two female commentators?!
Some great goals
All those strikes from Liverpool went tap ins
Feel bad for Leno, could do nothing about any of those!
Great game but not worth getting carried away because  Again we should be putting teams away more but we scoring these bangors I guess it makes up for it
Got to love Darwin Nunez passion for the club running over to celebrate with klopp and the rest of the bench quality
Mac allister>garnacho
That free kick by trent wasnt a own goal the gk didn't touch it!!!
How was that trent strike an own goal didn’t see it touch anyone else
Our keeper had a poor game today I would say, but 4 great goals. Keep women out of mens football they are crap.
The tottenham game is over now but it seems like the other teams are benefiting from them just beating nurse now everyone's beating tottenham because of their injuries and suspensions etcetera
Those goals where crazy 🤪
Will be very difficult to beat the Middle East this season but wins like this give them a chance
Liverpool refused to score from anything less than 18 yards out I see. Wow!
Trent is the best RB in the prem, prove me wrong.
McAlister omg he mysterious
Tsimikas casually assaulting Reid at the end before Trent scores, but God forbid a foul gets called against Liverpool in front of the kop.
God these female commentators are abismal
Commentary messed it all up
And Macallister has just scored goal of the season
Trent best goal of season that free kick
Excellent game ruined by female commentary! 🤬 will watch the EPSN highlights package instead
the game is plentiful of just bangers 🚀🔥
Liverpool and Fulham what a game 🎮
Great goals but sort this defence out
Women commentators suck
Unbelievable game. Anfield the theatre of dreams..
3 worldies from the reds, 4th wasnt bad either
This just goes to show that you can never write off this Liverpool team. Well done Reds. Great late winner from Trent.  YNWA
Great credit to Fulham, played really well, took 4 great goals to better them!
Awful female commentary ruined that.
Liverpool keeper is shiiite 😂
Hate female commentators  And pundits
Really shows the difference in missing alisson, saves both the first 2
Those goals against really leave a sour taste, the first 2 were horrific & shows how important Allison is to the team,  Trent doing a Stevie G & bailing us out at the end.
Can't believe they gave Trent's free kick as an OG. Absolute Ballocks that's a Trent goal
Kelleher appears to have lost all confidence, really basic errors on those goals. But luckily Trent and co bailed him out!
Sums up the Premier league terrible defending brilliant attacking
That Liverpool GK is as bad as Onana
Trent will get player of the month
4 marksman-like goals clawing back: Each goal a long-range rocket. Marvellous. Fulham and Silva the manager must be thinking what the hell do we have to do after scoring 3 goals...
Kelleher been really poor hope there's an uptake in form
That gets given as a foul at the other end of the pitch and at 99% of any other ground
No saving that... litrally scored an own goal
All 4 of these will be on the goals of the season this year, this game was outrageous
What a match, 4 Bangers From Liverpool
Women’s commentary is shockingly bad
All Liverpool goals were absolute Bangers!
Where’s the bloke love? Two sugars.
How good has Alexander arnold been class player
Bring back male commentators
How did the first one go down as own goal
Couldn't have picked 2 worse commentators for game of the season.
Alexis "Rooney" McAlister
The opposition could score in 96min and liverpool can score in the 97min that's how powerful anfield is it looks like no opposition can handle anfield
You can only improve from Keller surely
This game was a cracker! So cool watching it live
Endo needs to start and but Macc in his normal role.
How is that not a foul for the 4th goal😂😂
Westchester  high United were robbed, the man did kicks ball into the nets
As a Liverpool fan, it’s a nice experiment for Alisson to be injured every couple of seasons to give us a taste of what all other teams have to cope with - aka to have a normal human in goals 😂
There’s absolutely nobody quite like us, anywhere in the world 🥰🫶
Every time they do a combined City vs Liverpool team these pundits leave out Trent. I guarantee Guardiola would pick Trent all the time if he was a City player. He offers way too much.   A player highly praised by Cafu and Roberto Carlos as far back as 2018. Could potentially retire as the best RB ever.
Liverpool have only lost to VAR this season
Has to be bad for your heart supporting this team.  Have to defend better.   Either way the high after the low is something else.  Unlucky Fulham.
4 goals outside the 📦 !!
One of the best matches in premier league this season go liverpool.
That Trent free kick 🥶 McAli strike 🥶 Endo placement 🥶 Trent’s closer 🥶
what boring commentary for that MacAllister goal
Endo has had a few bad games a few good games but he's only just started
BEST RB IN PREM HISTORY
Game of the year prolly lmao 😂😂😂
GOOSEBUMPS!
I don’t know about you but female commentators are so difficult to listen to lol
Liverpool so often do it a hard way
Pretty sure all lfc goals are outside the box 😍. Fighting back against a spirited Fulham  is top drawer from the lad's. Great game 😀
Why was the first goal given as an OG?
Wow speechless, what a game!
No way in hell that's an own goal for Trent brilliant free kick goalkeepers are allowed touch it's not a known goal unless they just smash it in deliberately what they're talking about
Do they really have to use woman commentator? If they really use woman touch in football they can use it during match analyses after the game, which i never watch! But they use ex footballer then! I had to mute tv during the whole game Woman voice just doesnt go with football. It goes with tennis or volleyball but never heard a woman commentator for basketball game either.
On one football ball the first gaol is a og
Unbelievable game spoiled by horrendous commentary!!!
2 women on coms nice
Good commentary today!
Liverpools defence is a shambles. What exactly does VVD do anymore?? He’s always there in the wrong place when Liverpool concede looking for someone else to blame. TAA can’t defend to save his life, as for Tsimikas and Kelleher, the less said the better.
So many good games to chose from…. and sky decides to pick Moyes vs Hodgson
How on earth has the 1st goal been given as an OG to Leno, give Trent his goal
Need to get a grip at the back and up front us. Nunez getting left off the hook again with these bad sitters. Gakpo needs to start over him
HOW IS THAT AN OWN GOAL
Oh Fulham so close again
BEAUTIFUL GOALS BY LIVERPOOL
Another woman commentater......when will they ever learn.....switched off ....again
Mac allister pl goal of the season
Trent was outstanding! Great to see Endo getting another goal too, up the Reds!!
My days was this one crazy game with beautiful goals I think all these goals were outside the box
Two women on commentary for a game like this is a crime against humanity
Liverpool's keeper should have stopped at least two of those goals. Kelleher was very poor. He needs to improve.
What a game. Lovely goals from our boys. Playing ugly and winning games. That's what wins the prem LGE.
We might as well give teams a 2 goal head start, we give away some.many easy goals
All excitement from the game completely sucked out by the worst commentator in the world!!!!!!!!!!
And mute.....
Commentary is very biased to Liverpool here unfortunately. 🤨😕
Every single liverpool goal was class there. TAA is unbelievable 😍
WOW .. probably the best game of the season at the moment ... Mac Allistair  goal was absolutely SUBLIME ... End to End stuff from Liverpool & Fulham - What a thoroughly entertaining game by both sides 👏 And producing some outstanding goals.. This is what the true fans of football relish  🤩 👏 ⚽️⚽️⚽️
Arnold wasn't given the goal?
Nunez is not good enough for the Premier League.
Trent on fire right now
This is y mac allister is a no.10 and a cam
Commentary for men’s football full of women now, not a single man in women’s football tho
The goals that have been scored this season 😊
Absolute spawn from liverpool today
I love liverpool
All 4 of Liverpools goals were insane
Women commentary 😢 awful
What a goal from macca!!🔥 Puskas worthy!
Every Liverpool goal was amazing today😭
What A Game And Some Of Them Goals Wow. Well Done Liverpool From A West Ham Supporter x
Unpopular opinion but that last goal should of been chalked off for a foul on the defender. He was taken out and could of possibly blocked that shot if he wasn't.
World class goals wow
everyone here is commenting for Liverpool so I'm just going to appreciate my lads as well. we put up a nice fight. COYW!
Liverpool deciding to score worldies every game now. 😂
Shame about the commentator on this, these goals deserved more...
Outstanding comeback
How has arnold scored more goals than a cm in 1 game 😂❤❤
That Mac allister goal…
As I have been saying for the past 18 months we are not going to win the league anytime soon with this defence! Van Dijk is shot to piece, he plays like his feet are in cement and has become absolute woeful! Konate is like Bambi on Ice and Matip should not be anywhere near the club!
Starting to give up on nunez 💯
YNWA ❤
Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat ,  oh  the glory  oh the glory   it just  tastes so sweet  to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat
Stop screeching woman.
All 3 goals came from bad defending and goalkeeping
First time I've been to Anfield, what a game to go to!
Very rare game when none of our strikers scored ⚽️
Keeper let in 2 goals today
Happy but some of that defending was abysmal to say the least. Sort it Jurgen
What a resilience, determination and courage by LFC players. Weldone.
Kelleher needs sacking man, how are we supposed to win the league with that 😂
I honestly think if Alison was in goal, Fulham's first two aren't going in, not a great performance from kelleher. I dare say Alison would have had the presence to come out for Fulham's third. but I digress, he's gotta step up and do better.
Kelleher has had a bad day at the office
What a mach unbelievable goals from liverpool and mac allister FIRST GOAL OF THE SEASON FOR LFC! And a stunning goal for its first goal and are defence was bad like what lfc_szn4274 said and I also agree with him because sheffield united are doing bad in this league so I think where defently beeting sheffield united like 3-0 or 4-0
Arnold showing tripper how to hit a free
Trent is becoming a match winner in vital moments... just like another scouser who wore the arm band YNWA JFT97
4 absolute worldies so glad we got the win do they weren’t overshadowed
Ill leave it at Liverpool been very leaky at the back 😮 but some savage goals scored
These games without Alisson are going to be torture.
How come when I look at the stats of the game I says the first goal was an open goal ??? Trent should have 2 clear goals there
First goal given as an OG how keeper didn't touch it was a trent goal all day
Come on reds we are climbing up the table very fast❤ (come on REDS)❤😊😮
Why does every presenter on male football seem to be female these days
Liverpool we’re really missing Alisson at least 2 of the goals he would have saved.
Nahhhh all the goals with class
Commentary completely ruins the goals
Arigato, Endo-Sama  and Omedeto for your first premier league goal for Liverpool🙏🏿. Macca you beauty! Well done for not giving up!! Brilliant again from Trent. But what was our defence doing today?!?!? I’ll need a heart transplant before Xmas if I go through another match like that again!!!
How fickle.are LiVARpool fans. Quiet for most of the game when losing pathetic support. But then all noise when they score or winning.  Learn to support for the full match 💩
Nunez needs to be better, we're all entertained by his chaos ball but objectively speaking he's a terrible finisher
I had to mute the commentary........For obvious reasosns.
I was so worried cause i saw cause i saw it was 2-3 to Fulham on the pl table  But seeing that 4-3 brightened me up Tbh I’m worried about our next few matches Fulham is a decent team but the fact we scored 3 worries me especially since we have a big team like Arsenal to face. Hopefully Allison is there for the Arsenal match
The woman commenting just ruins the whole mood.
Every Liverpool Goal was worthy of a goal of the month entry, Phenomenal fight!
Kelleher was abysmal at times today between the sticks. Alisson is sorely missed
With alisson in goal this a 4v1 game... kellegher doing his best onana impression he was a hologram and at fault for the first 2 goals. Absolutely terrible performance defensively which is not on the keeper... im worried if we keep performing like this without alisson to save us like he always does.
Four superb goals three defensive howlers
Why is there 2 women commenting?? ☕️
Liverpool decided to only score amazing goals today
Incredible. When is Ali back?
One bad man head this commentator
Wonderful game ruined by the dinner lady in the commentary box
Kelleher is an absolutely awful goalkeeper
Wow, just wow
Kheller was at fault 4 the 1st 2 goals shud av done betta
This is literally why I’m supporting Liverpool no matter if they lose they will always go up like they are God Of Premier League (GOPL)
Mac Allister 😍
Excellent result, but letting 3 goals in at Anfield needs looking at. Keep going reds.
why do fulham fans barley celebrate when they score? shite fanbase
Mac 10! WOW!!🔥
We got away with it today didn't we? damn. Good comeback & win though👏👏
This woman commentator is awful 😖
Kellerer could have done better
All screamers
Would have loved to watch this but instead the only game of 4 live on sky was the mid table snooze fest West Ham vs palace. Thanks for the great coverage!
God the commentary is absolutely rubbish
Since when have we seen that many Liverpool goals from midfield, what a turnaround
That Liverpool 4th goal, how was that not a free kick?
Think this match just proves that Kelleher isn't good enough to be our back up keeper. He had a good cup run the other season but he makes too many mistakes. Alisson wouldn't have conceded any of those goals
We scored 4 screamers incredible
Had to mute the 2 people being paid to talk over the match as they are unqualified to commentate on men's football .  not 1 but 2 , talk about controlling the people !
This has to be game of the season so far
Female commentators ruin this
One of the poorest Anfield performances in years, but the character they showed when behind was shades of 19-20 LFC. Big win! 🔥🔴
I love this Liverpool team ❤ YNWA
Think that goalkeeper needs to go
Could not imagine the scene watching those Liverpool goals go in. One word sensational
Never. Give. Up.
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Entertaining to watch, and eventually we got the points.  Kelleher and Tsimikas are equally awful!  We got away with it today.
Liverpool goalkeeper made too many mistakes still they won
This shows Liverpool can't win the title. Extremely easy to score against.
As a Chelsea supporter I’m glad Liverpool beat Fulham
If we could defend we’d rule the world😂😂 Unbelievable goals though! Shame we have to make life so hard sometimes hahaha
Commentators are hurting my ears
Mo Salah handball before setting goal up, didn't show that angle
Liverpool having their own goal of the month contest today!
ABSOLUTELY WOW!!!! FOUR FANTASTIC GOALS!!! VERY WELL DONE BOYS!!!!!!!!!
Trent reminded me off gerrard at the end
Great game. Great goals.. all ruined by the high pitched shrill of Sly-Sports DE&I commentator.
Four gorgeous strikes. Would have been a travesty not to win that. The Endo change won it, he scored and it freed Trent. Still think we need a top defensive mid brought in to start games as the balance isn't there.
Has there ever been 4 better goals by the same team in the same game?
The fact that all 4 of Liverpool goals where bangers is insane 🔥 Don't take anything away from Fulham though
What shocking defense. Liverpool cannot give easy goals away like that.
Dead commentary
2.31 is a blatant foul in the buildup not even looked at. Reid wins the header and is then shoved over.
Sheesh some match that..
Another game I had to listen to muted, sooner they ditch these man birds the better.
What a comeback 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Trent is so class we got back up even conceding goals with that goalkeeper doesn’t matter to us YWNA
Mac Allister’s goal 😱
Nothing but bangers from Liverpool today
The zestiest shush I’ve ever seen😂class goal tho
Still can’t get used to female commentators lol
My ears after that commentary😢
Endo cost 16m while Caicedo cost 115m whilst ghosting in 10th.
All those Liverpool goals are pure beauty
Will be interesting to see how much is made of that blatant foul on Reid before the Trent winner. Clear barge in the back.  LiVARpool.
Women commentators shite.
It all came right in the endo!
Here before viral
As bad as Nunez misses were today, both last goals he kept the ball alive. He won the header for salah to set up endo. He followed up gakpos shot to tsimikas to assist Trent. Under the radar very important 🔥
Ridiculous how the PL has put Trent's freekick down as an own goal.
That would have been a 5 nil walk in the park if alisson played
Fulham aren't scoring two of those goals against Alisson, wasn't a great game for young Kelleher. Hopefully just nerves because he is a good keeper
Had to turn the sound off to watch this. Fifth rate Alan Partridge-style commentary, but at least Sky ticked some boxes.
How can they have female commentators for that game, the commentary for them goals should be a lot better than it is .
Keeper had a nightmare
Allison required.....
respect to those fulham fans that clapped for alli macs rocket 👏
Shrieking female commentators again. Even the co-commentator was at it. NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO IT SKY.  Totally ruins watching what was a great match.
This game shows me how much we miss Allison 😢
If only Peter Drury was the commentator
Along with City and Chelsea, this has to be one of the best; if not THE best premier league game of the season. Such a joy to watch and the goals were surreal.... Liverpool's goals weren't too bad either.
Every liverpool goal today was a stunner but the keeper and def today was 💩  got to get better at the back carnt wait for allison to get back fit
Bring back Alisson!!
i swear every goal was a goal of the season contender. coming from a man city fan. 🫨
what a game those goals was so special
Need Allison back ASAP
liverpool strikers 💀liverpool midfield and defence👌
Liverpool trying there best to stop Garnacho getting goal of the season 😂
Kelleher had a bad game today.
Garnacho: you cant score a goal like i did.          Mcallister: hold my beer
goal of the month selection is mental
Another struggling performance against a team we should be destroying, our defence needs a shake up some players need to be replaced, I'd have Phillips over Matip but he's on loan, keeper wasn't great either and how was Trents free kick an OG?
Trent be liking them new boots
Shame the free kick has not been given to TAA
Absolutely robbery for Trent, his first goal was counted as an Own Goal…
I feel like this is the kind of games I’ll rewatch 1000 times for years. Just like the 4-3 against dortmand and the 4-0 against Barca. Absolute scenes at the end there
Soon as I hear two women commentating on the game I instantly lose Interest, zero passion zero excitement in there voice, terrible
Kelleher had a stinker of a game, Nunez still levitating a question mark above his head, other than that , fantastic.
got a little boy in goal
Omg a game of 4 absolute worldies and 3 goalkeeping howlers 😂
Macallister > Garnacho
Wowowowow
Amazing game! Stunning goals and electric atmosphere
This shows the importance of Alison .
Another one I watched with no volume , woman commentators awfull .
That image of all the players running with aeroplane arms out to the corner flag in celebration of Trent’s goal and Darwin running the other way is just brilliant 😂👏🏻
Someone fire this commentator
Im a neutral but thought that was a clear foul on the Fulham player at the back post for Trent’s last goal
Im a fulham fan and i gotë soooooo mad
Kelleher has been poor this year so far
Mac Allister goal was EA FC power shot in real life 🤯🔥🔥🔥
Thrilling game, and 4 top draw goals.  But.  Defensively and the GK, we were utter pants.   Ali would have saved probably all those chances, the went straight thro our keeper!
Women commentary on men's games shouldn't be allowed
Grandma Shirley is just checking this headline is correct using my Grandma calculations and yes 4 plus 3 equals 7 so yes well done sky sport it was a 7 goal thriller
Shite commentary
Which goal was not good😂
Those sqeaker commentator voices though. 😕
Comic defending..can’t wait to face Liverpool in the champions leagu..wait never mind
What strikes by the whole Liverpool squad today. Mac Allister being my favourite. West fight by fulham as well.  Klopp really said only bangers today 🌟
Mac Allister goal was just 🥶❄️
All four Liverpool goals absolute screamers !! 👏👏
4 spectacular goals
All the goals were unbelievable for liverpool
Unless we sign a 6 we'll never be able to close games down when we go ahead. Too open to win a trophy.
Game of the season
0:18. The cool cold look of a freekick assassin and his name Alexander-Arnold, Trent Alexander-Arnold. He is a very superb free kick set piece taker and his executions are very very deadly. Liverpool should consider making him into a midfielder one day or advance his role as a hybrid fullback/midfielder.
I'm saying this from now. If Liverpool plays like this against another tough side at Anfield they will LOSE that match. They absolutely got away with one today. Loved the goals though.
Defense wins titles, embarrassing yet again. 3 goals!
Trent is better then Szobbo & Macca
4 amazing Liverpool Goals
I wish garnacho hadn't have scored the overhead kick because then goal of the season would be between these 4 goals
Game if the season 1000%
WHAT A GAME!!🤯🤯 Trent just be scoring for the sake of it
Why does Nunez looks like a girl???
As much as liverpools defence was poor, the keeper has been horrendous. Both the first two goals were conceded by him and the last goal, the defence wasnt good enough to stop that header or even the cross. However, liverpool were given too much space for the goals they scored. What an exciting match that was!
Trent has been amazing
come on liverpool!!!!❤
Anfield really has the best fans in the world. Last 5 minutes were electrifying. 🔥
What a goal from mac allister, Liverpool winning the league
Trent is like best Stricker for Liverpool atm lol
Mac allisters goal shits all over garnachos bicycle kick 😂
We need Alisson back
Worldies only from Liverpool 🔥🔥🔥
Liverpool always seem to make hard work of Fulham.  Unlucky to Leno for that OG.
Every liverpool goal was phenomenal
Come on liverpool
Trent is on his revenge arc and there's no sign of stopping now 👿 2 goals in one game(opener and winner) 🌟
We can never win a game the easy way 😂
The duality of Trent. He needs to play in midfield
Kelleher looking like onana today
Why is Kelleher still at Liverpool!?
Sky showed the West Ham / Palace game
YOU WILL NEVER SCORE ALONE
So glad my volume button works.
UNBELIEVABLE GOALS FROM LIVERPOOL ! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow what a game, as an arsenal fan a fulham win would’ve been the best possible outcome. but fair play to liverpool👏🏻
Kelleher is so bad
haha get in, what a game.
Alexander the great
gotta feel sorry for the Fulham goalkeeper, those shots were insane!!
A sign of true champions, never giving up. YNWA
What's with having two woman commentators on this match. Having one screeching out clichés and no football knowledge is bad enough.
Absolute banger of a game
Man this kinda of game I enjoy as a neutral, but as a Liverpool fan, I went on an emotional rollercoaster. Glad we got the win (again from a losing position), but we do have a lot of improvements to make. We don't seem to put teams under pressure like we were doing 2/3 seasons ago. Very happy with the win though.
every goal of ours was from the 12yrd line or further🔥 havent watched the full game yet but to conceed 3 is some bad defending from usual suspects like gomez and trent and matip or kelleher really isnt ready to fill in for allison but then again how do you replace the best keeper in the world. either way great 3 points and superb 4 goals
Trent played so well that he turned into Cafu
Put in on mute though 🤦‍♂️ the high pitch just tops it off 👂
I was the first person to like!
If there was a football match related to absolute mayhem it would be this match
Sky Sports are very poor at creating highlights for each PL match they cover. Less than 3 minutes is poor.
On my life Fulham fans are the worst in the league by far, celebrating going up against Liverpool away from home like they’ve just scored a goal when 5-0 down
How is the fourth goal given, when there’s a foul on Reid? Too 6 bias again
That Macalister goal 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
We always make mistakes in defence and Allison saves us. But them goals scored by fullham were stoppable. Kelleher was garbage and it proves how important Allison is to the team. Against bigger teams, you can’t get away with it. Also Trent was robbed off a goal. Absolute monster he is.
This game as a SEVEN GOAL THRILLER was Full of Goals from the Highest Order!
Trent is not any RB... HE IS THE RB!!! Clear of that fraud James...
That commentator is absolutely awful
What a game of footy, with some absolute worldy goals
Well done boys 👍
Them Scousers again.
Nothing but bangers today😍😍😍😍😍
insaneeeee finishing from liverpool
What a strike from mac allister and from wataru endo too and of course trents 2 goals too
We made an amazing comeback with 2 goals in 2 minutes
how did liverpool score four stunners
That is amazing! Some lovely goals, that is no less than a premier league classic
Gotta feel sorry for those Liverpool goals, worldy after worldy n they still won't win goal of the season 😂😂
what a game
Commentary. Muted 😬
All four LFC goals were exactly what you want to see as a fan pure class 🔥 what a comeback 🔥
Liverpool are conceding way too many goals, Def is shocking
LIVERPOOL BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD!!!!🔥🤩❤️
Never mind Trent’s class goals today. His passing is simply out of this world 🔥🔥🔥
OFFICIAL GOBBLEDY GOOKER I MISSSSSEDD YOUUUUU DADDY
How’s that Trent goal an own goal 😂 great win for the lads just shows WE NEVER GIVE UP!! YNWA
What is goiong on with Nunez?
Absolutely thrilling game, credit to Fulham who more than played their part. Trent will one day be mentioned in the same breath as Gerrard and dare I say it, Dalglish I’m sure of it.
This reminds me of the spurs game
Can someone tell me how that free kick was a leno og?
Nice to see Wilson not celebrating…
What a thrilling match! First thunderbolt goals for Macallister and for Endo! Credit to Fulham, they were very good and put up a good fight! Up the Reds! 😊
Absolute Mayhem
Amazing game - what drama - Liverpool left it late to get of jail - epic comeback to bag all 3 points
Four absolute cracking goals. Fair play Reds!!
Really harsh that they have put the free kick down as a Leno OG
Wow what an amazing game of football and what a win for my team but fair play to Fulham they were magnificent today but I am really happy with the 3 points what a game trent was superb today what superb 4 goals we scored today
Fulhams keeper cannot shot stop 😂😂 cracking goals from Liverpool, Fulham did well to exploit their defence. Great game from an Arsenal fan.
I never thought we’d find someone capable of matching Gerrard’s legacy this fast. Obviously he’s not there yet but he’s well on his way to being.
BANGERS FROM TRENT, ENDO AND MCALISTER
Is no one gonna talk about how good those Liverpool goals were... WOW!
0:11 0:58 2:14 2:35
All 4 liverpool goals of the season contenders
It's ridiculous that we can't watch these games in England. All of the midweek games are on Amazon Prime this week. Why can't they do that every weekend. It's insane that people in Germany and the United States can watch these games live and we can't.
Alison would have stopped all of them
Liverpool refused to win the game with tap ins.
this is anfield, this is what we do
Wilson's teeth were offside
Kelleher is awful
Fair play Fulham, some teams lose  7 nil
I love endo !!
Why am I listening to two 12 year old boys commentating on the mens game?
Liverpool are a bad boy team!
Trent is stupidly an amazing footballer
i can watch this all day
Decent free kick from Trent Ngl
What a way to score your first Liverpool goal. That was sensational from Mac Allister. 🤯
wow what a game all the liverpool goals were really good as well
Great game, shame i had to watch this on mute. Horrendous commentators voice.
The scouser in our team ❤
All the Liverpool goals were bangers 🤩
You gotta have lady luck with you if your gonna win the league 🏆 🎉
Up the reds
Zesty ahh shush from trent 💀
Cracking goals
Why have Sky condensed this down to under 3 minutes??? Give us more!!
mMay not support Liverpool or Fulham but what a match…. Smash and grab by Fulham….. Liverpool “Nahhhh, not suffering that” TAA is the bollox…
Liverpool trying to take up all the spaces in goal of the month on their own
Imagine not liking football? The game does my head in at times with all this VAR nonsense but days like today remind you why its the greatest sport on earth
Trent is a better finisher than nunez and he's a RB  😂 agonising seeing how many times he has good opportunities
Livepool i don’t have to say more
Liverpool just done the most Liverpool thing ever
What an absolutely brilliant game! Some goal of the season contenders as well! Brilliant advert for football
This is one of those games where tomorrow we're probably going to need to have an inquest into how Liverpool needed four moments of super individual quality to beat Fulham, but for today let's just appreciate another thriller of a game
Why do we have 2 women commentating on this game? It really is getting ridiculous
Ughh Hurry Back Alisson. Great drive to dig deep and get the win late. Up the the Reds
Whole Liverpool Squad showing City you don’t have to score tap ins to win
Why do people hate Liverpool? I don't understand? 🤔
Trent is that guy 🤫
Don't let the crazy scoreline or 2 goals in 2 minutes comeback hide the fact that Mac Allister scored one of the best goals I've ever seen at Anfield. Statistically it's travelled the most yards since Origi vs West Brom in 2015
None of us Reds expected this bloody score 🤣 What a Win🔴❤️
Bangers fc
That Mac Alister goal was sensational
What a goal from Endo and TAA❤
Two female commentators 😐😐
Let's goooo Endo!!!!
What a game. Roller coaster of emotions. Still, it was a very poor performance from us despite getting the win. The defence was poor and the drop off from Alli to Kelleher is staggering. Need to be much more defensively resolute in the coming games to try and stay on the tails of City and Arsenal.
I wish City had that kind of atmosphere like at Anfield 😭😭
This had to be posted quick
What a fantastic game🤩
Mac Allister’s goal is absolutely ridiculous 🤩
Absolutely stunning goals from Liverpool today. We weren’t the strongest in defence but the important part is that we won, hopefully we can do better against Sheffield.
How is that not a foul for the last goal 😂🤣
TAA. Take a bow son.
Trent is him.
while trent is scoring goals to win his team points Reece james is getting sent off
Never count Liverpool out
All of Liverpool's goals were belters
So rigged every match Liverpool come back, bit repetitive, defo paying refs or teams
Missed alisson today Liverpool
As a Liverpool fan with a Fulham season ticket, I don't know how to react to Liverpool vs Fulham: 3-2 to Fulham after they score an 80th minute winner, then Liverpool score an 87th minute equaliser and 88th minute winner!!!!!!
This is why Liverpool will challenge for the title. Grinding out results is the biggest sign of a top team
Macalister goal of the season hands down
Liverpool not stable enough to win the title!
Klop at full time you know you should never take the lead at anfield 😂😂😂
I’m surprised by the scorline
The women’s commentary is absolutely dribble
silienco
Mac Allister 🔥
i love liverpool
Nunez aint ready
Trent’s performances are starting to become consistent. Hope he can keep up the good performances.
Jesus christ Kelleher
ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEBACKS THIS SEASON. WELL DONE LIVERPOOL!!!
We're going to win the league
Gerrard looks a bit different. Crazy game, 31 points from losing positions for Liverpool in 2023
Trent is just him This team never gives up
MY RB 🤌🤌🔥🔥💯💯
Ware game up the reds
Trent is him
Trent is different blud. Liverpool vs Arsenal is a game I’m looking forward to.
Finally
Why did the give it to us last 😭
Every Liverpool goal was a banger
Endo you beautiful man
trent is the rb itw🥶🥶
TRENT 🤫
😂 Alexis who?
Decent game
mentality monsters
what a game what a bunch of goals. wow.
YESSSSSSSS FINALLY
Trent has more goals than that fraud Trashford! What a game!
Trent is levels
Never in doubt
Not a single goal scored by Nunez. What a surprise......
So embarrassing from Fulham some of them players should quit football 😂😂
What a game
Liverpool have a chance being top 4
Wataru Endo has been class for Liverpool. Really showing why an experienced midfielder was needed after Henderson bailed
Wow!
LETS BGOOO
It always seems to be the best games that we cant watch on TV 😭
Brilliant game
We got lucky. Wide open at the back all game. Sign a proper 6 and RB asap.
Trent is just out of this world… 🤩
It can't be a Liverpool game without late drama
Trent is the goat 🐐🐐🐐
Mad
Trent masterclass
Happy for Endo and Mac for scoring, but we shouldn't have to score 4 goals to win a match..1 goal should be enough, we need to learn to win games 1-0. ❤️
First
Reece James is still clear of Trent
YESSS
Ynwa
Finally you post it
First
Yes
