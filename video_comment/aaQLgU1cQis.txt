😂😂😂😂
Maybe she needs better food?
Such agud mum
Dogs are so peculiar 😂❤
Perfect fake out
😂😂😂❤❤
🤣
My dogs the same way. On a side note, look at dem titties.
I really don't think I could fool my dog
She's so beautiful❤
It’s the best you’ve ever made!
Try feeding her some meat 😢
İf she will be happy that way let her have this treatment everytime, only takes 30 seconds to make her feel whole and fullfilled🥰🤗
That is SO funny...dogs... what can you do?
Every two weeks when i get paid i go get a couple bags of carrots, apples, broccoli, etc. Its NEVER expensive. Cheap as hell actually. With a small portion of their regular kibble of course. And my dogs go insane for it. Just a tip for anyone out there.
It's special cause you did nice things.
dog knows that's not real food you're supposed to give. Food has to be cooked ..
Oh for the love all that is holy is is so adorable the way she watches and waits.
Dog: WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE?!
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
Who has who trained ?? 😂😂😂
THE HEAVIES,  GYAT DAMN
So funny
She wanted you to put the love on it. The special ingredient.
🧐🍼🍼
She wants a sprinkle of ❤ added.
How did you ever figure this out!?😂
Hmmmm, placebo sause and undetectable condiments, my favorite!
My dog does the same thing.
Someone call doggy pd 😂🐕
Absolutely adorable!
Geezzz, he'll  eat when he's hungry
You can't be that stupid
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary,  is that little extra.
Thats pretty funny my dog does the same thing and i dont even know why it started.
Awee shes so smart. Its actually showing how close she pays attention to u when u prepare food. Or u did it a few times and in her head it became gourmet best thing she ever tasted and wants it no other way. And she knows u love her enough to do it if she asks in her own way of turning it down at first.
She wants to eat like a people do!
You're on YouTube dummy. !!!!!!!     We wanted to watch crappy tik Tok videos we would be on crappie tick tock not here on YouTube !!!!!!!!   😂😂
LoL
Too funny. 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I’m dead af
The dog will eat whats in the bowl eventually if you stop babying it
Give the dog some better food she won't hesitate to eat it those dry biscuits alone are not great but lovely dog all the best
Too cute. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
the dog has you well trained
😂😂😂😂
Im with doggo. It's not about the meal, it's about the love
The dog saying cook me some eggs😂😂😂😂
Cute 🥰
What was in microwave ?   Anyway cute  Smart doggo  But dry  kibble no bueno
Hilarious!!😅😅😊
Made with love by Mom! What could be better?
That is hilarious 😂
Good lord 😅
My Doberman will take his paw and flip his bowl upside down if I put dry dog food in it.
😂😂😂 bless her heart
Haha😅
The secret ingredient is love!
Ah, you faked her out
I didn’t see anything come out of that bottle?
I am reminded of the Search for the Holy Ggggrrrraillll....A WITCH, A WITCH, A WITCH!!!!
The "boss" dog. Lol ❤
My female has to do the same thing for me
You're awesome for doing that for your baby
Bless her! Its because she watches you cook and she wants the same 😂❤
😂 Boujee
You have to make it with love. Duh
OMG, that pup is so pure of heart! The ecstatic appreciation-dance upon receiving the meal would make it worthwhile for me!
She wanted that extra special special from Mama it's called cooking with love, and you are so kind to go that extra step to ensure they really feel like they're getting their special meal the things we won't do for our fur babies
😂
She a good pupp
She's part of your family, she wants treated like everyone else.
It’s a dog. A dog is a pet. Not a human. Not doing it any favors by treating it like a person.
You, ma'am, are an absolute swindler. Your highness (the dog), expects exclusively prepared meal with actual food ingredients, a fine dining experience, to be precise. You were just banging pots and pans, and chopping air on the board. 😭  Please expect pee in your shoes and carpet.
After all he's German.
That dog is a genius.😂😂😂
Just leave it the dog will eventually eat
Poor baby😢😢
Creativity at its finest! ❤
😂😂😂😂
My dog is just like that I have to microwave for 10 seconds his already prepared meal or he won’t eat it
ROTFL,  poor baby.  She thinks she has the best mommy because you take the time to prepare her gourmet meals.  I love it! ❤
Let the dog wait an hour or two. Catering will not be required.
How long you think it'll be before the dog calls your bluff?
Our Dog & 5 Cats are the Exact Same Way!!!
Hahahahaha amazing
You could put some chicken on top of that dry food.
The ritual must be completed before she can take the offering foolish hooman
Dumb dog lol
Feed raw
Yeah that’s your fault.
When I babysit my mom's dog, I have to pretend to eat some first. She has trust issues.
That's not food. Would you want to eat beef flavored cheerios everyday for life
Lol❤❤
She wants Mommy to prepare her mail
She just wants Mommy to show her some attention like she cares
it's called takeout vs dining in
😂😂😂 hilarious
Instead or pretending to properly prepare and cook your dogs food, you only have ONE DOG, BUY SO.E REAL GOD DAMN FOOD FOR HIM/HER.
Yes, she will eat if you wait long enough.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ love from Sweden 🌹
Looks like you haven't missed to many meals the way you have your belly tucked down into those shorts !!!
It’s a German Shepherd thing 😂
Nice big ol snatch
Adorable
The timer beep though. Set it all off. Love the fake chopping too. Adorable dog
This is exactly how my dog acts 😂😂😂😂
Sweet fur baby
Now this is funny 🤣  Thanks for sharing 😊
That’s called love
I do that to my wife
She's telling the food is boring, how about some meat,even if it's can dog food. Its not the dog its you😂
It's not nice to full puppy
That's just cruel,  at least put some water on that dry kibble.
She's adorable❤❤❤ she considers you part of her tribe yall are her tribe 😊❤
SO DANG CUTE❤ I LOVE IT!
Made with love and that's what makes it better
Ha, ha, ha,, we always mixed 'people food' with our dog's food.  I get it.
Thats soo adorable, youvareca great mother. just adorable.❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤😂🎉🎉🎉😂😂❤❤❤😂🎉🎉😂😂❤😂😂🎉🎉
Haha! Shepherds are so extra! Love it
My cat wouldn't eat unless she had fresh food. I thought i was slick and tried to throw it bk in the bag and pour it again, yea she wasnt having it. 😂 Spoiled af man!
so cute and funny
Just like our dog
I have to fake the microwave with mine😂
My dog wants breakfast,  lunch  and dinner with snacks in between
😂 funny but that dog is one spoiled pup That is just too funny
At least make a gravy for her!!!!!
I would open both end's of the can and push it out into his dish and my dog did not want it broken apart. He would pick it up and put it on the floor to eat.
My dog just went to her bowl😊
10m views ain't for the dog.
That’s adorable 😂 the magic of mom
So precious!!!
Ain't nothing wrong with 🐕 it's you 😂😂😂😂
....and you dont even feel bad....
So so funny.. gsd are brats 😂
My dogs are the same way lol ❤😂
😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰
Heavies😂😂
AWW❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahaha! OCD doggy by Proxy! Hahaha!
Its the special food...lol
My dog is the same way..😂
I have to pretend I'm eating the dog food to get my dog to eat
I JUST WANT MY FRENCH FRIES MASHED
I can't get over that dog. 😅
Hilarious 😆
❤❤❤😊😊😊
dog paid for the experience 😂😂
The owner of dog is ridiculous, maybe😅😅😅
How 😂❤ cute 🥰 I love her
Hysterical
Real neat and gravy mom please!😊
You gotta season my food….
I made the same mistake.  We did this.
Heh, talk about spoiled. Well, at least he eats, right ✅️ 😅..
We have cats who won’t touch their food unless we “bless” it by touching it 😂
You spoiled her
She was missing the special ingredient, love.
I have this dog, 😂🐾
What a great mom
😂 you started it you started it
My dog does the same thing ! We say " Ya gotta put some love in it, and make a big show of it ! So we'll put a vitamin or a small dime size piece of chicken or a teaspoon of plain yogurt,  a few shreds of cheese,a solo green bean ! And move a spoon around and make some noise ! He's a tripod chihuahua mix. They just want love. So cute😅
She’s a gor-Mute ! They have very high standards 😅😅😅❤❤❤
🤣🤣🤣
I’m dying laughing!!  This is hilarious.  I thought my dog was the only one 😂
Gee, i wonder where it got into that habit?
Queen 👑
watch the Doc.... Pet Fooled !!!
Mine three are the exact same yes they are spoiled
😂🤣😂  Best part is how she watched u do absolutely nothing but tha movement tha whole time... b;tch plays u well tho...😂🤣😂🤣😂
All it needed was mama's love.
She just loves you mama.😂
Love this baby
🤣
This is so cute and funny😂😂😂😂😂 Do you blame her?
😂😂😂😂 mine will not eat if I am not close by, I mean really close by.
😂😂😂😂
What if the dog is thinking,  "man, this sh!t is still bland.  She can't cook."
That dog trainer he well😢
So. Routine....❤
That is exactly right. She watches everything you do in the kitchen and she wants her food the same way and she deserves it. She’s a beautiful young lady. Thank you for sharing.
That is so funny 👌🤣
How long did it take her to train you like that?
How did you discover this? Or create it, or whatever?
adorable
Too cute❤
She thinks you put in table scraps on her food This woman is an ass
My baby sometimes wants to be hand fed . Will not eat unless i feed him . Then sometimes he's a big boy and eats on his own
Now You!have her spoiled  lol
She is OCD 😂😂
O m g that is the cutest thing! Wants to be part of the family. In that matter as well o m g
😂😂😂💜
Why not add a few nummies in her food? Plenty of things that are nutritious for dogs. My dogs get a little bit of wet food in their kibble, pumpkin and blueberries, coconut oil and sometimes raw honey.
Such a sweet girl.  So she's a little spoiled.  She deserves it.  Bet you love her to pieces.
Gorgeous doggie!! I’d give her whatever she wants ❤
She is a member of the family needs to be treated equally… adorable dog♥️♥️♥️
Maybe he just wanted water?
OMG - my dog does the same thing!!! And it must be warm :)
♥️♥️
I thought I was the only one my two do the same,one won't eat til I sit with her.Look at this meal!!!!!!!!
She wants that extra love added to the bowl❤️😃. I just want to squeeze this pup!❤️
She’s one of the family and want to be involved
You feels  special when you make him his meal
I get a cappuccino and it has to have a smiley face and my autism son has a hot with a smiley face too. Everytime we go to OTR in Australia.
I have a very similar ridiculous dog
Yep! My German Shepherd also does it. I thought she is weird. Apparently not.😂
Spoiled rotten lol too cute
Dog Placebo
I think she should have actually added something healthy like cooked vegetables
I wouldn’t want to eat that either
Omg I love that baby! So cute
That’s hysterical!!
Wait!.... There was a dog in the video?
Is she worth the extra work?................of course she is❤ .
Touche'😂❤
OMG, my two dogs do the same thing I have to do the same thing every day funny
she needs rice and beans lmprao
Are you broke,why would you trick your bubba!?
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
Little doggie is boogie.
That's funny.
lolol....my cat is the same way
lol! I had a cat who and a dog on separate occasions who would come to get me to stir their food to freshen it up.
My cat does the same thing. She need to 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳 the sounds  of routine.
Don't worry my dog also does this. Pretends to be picky but as soon as you start saying the food is good & you put the "spices" in the bowl she's all over it 😂😂😂
Can absolutely identify with this. I have to do this (sometimes) to get my dog to eat her food. It's their world and we're just living in it!😂
It's a female animal.  It MUST be treated special. <eye roll>
Hilarious
She will eat it if she's hungry 🙄🙄
😆😆
This is too much but I love it 😂😂😂😂 She just wants to included too❤❤❤ I'm wondering if you have to do this each time, she wants to eat? Lol cute dog ❤
My sweet boy would only eat off a fork, and we had to hold the fork for him. I'd give anything in the world to do it just one more time.
You ought to be a shame of your self😂😂
She’s spoiled just like my dog ❤
She wanted the full experience of how you cook she's spoiled rotten 😂😂that dog has plenty sense 😂
Can't discipline even a dog. What a mess. You don't need a dog, or a cat, or a mouse.
She wants to be treated the same.
Give that baby some real food.. geesh
OMG that is too cute! 🥰
She is saying she wants some real food, not that god awful kibble. Gag!
Your dog has you well trained.  8o)
BAHAHA WHAT A KNEE SLAPPER 😂
That's actually what happens in restaurants.. we love that extra, too..
BIG BOOBIES
Whaaat 😂❤🎉
She looks like a special meal 😂
Missed opportunity on making a dog food commercial 😂 They are popular now, where they show the switch from one brand to another.
She wants it special.
Add some real meat to it - chicken, beef, sardines, cottage cheese, liver.
😂😂😂
I love her
She is so precious !!
She wants her meal prepared like the rest of her family ❤
😅😅to dang cute. I thought my Nahla was the only spoiled dog that went eat until she see me chop, stir and warm her food, like I do for her big brother, whom is also spoiled rotten❤❤😊
Psychosocymitic.
She'll protect you, no matter what.  Feed that baby.. LOL 😆
Homemade food is always better!
My dog does the same thing. Lol😂
it's because your dog does not want to eat processed food for its whole life so it's giving itself the illusion that you actually care and would feed it something worthwhile. This video is sad😢
MOM'S SPECIAL TOUCH MAKES MY MEAL TASTE  WONDERFUL. THANK YOU MOM. ❤ YOU ARE THE BEST.. ❤😊
Hahahaha!! My dog does the samething!!   If we are having dinner I need to make believe I am serving her from my plate..and then she eats.
My dog does the same thing
Just like a sugar pill.
I can’t deal!! So cute
Your dog needs Farmers dog food. My dogs are crazy about that food.😊
You tricking that dog😂😂😂😂😂
My dog won't eat his food unless we add 2 chicken strips to it ,lol omg I should've don't that trick lol 😂😂😂😂
Dogs don't understand sarcasm and you should put some love in that bowl That's what she's looking for
🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂❤ she deserves farmers dog food
dogs are such excellent people....  mine have to have their meals "cooked" twice per day.  my dane has to have her bed "made" every night before she'll lay down....
❤ adorable!!😂
My Bishop waits til I start eating
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT,MY CATS DO THE same thing,LOL!!!!!!
My cat do the same 🤣🤣🤣😻😻
😂 Beautiful animal! (Hope she gets meat in addition to kibble.)
She wants that special loving touch!
Lmao that’s beautiful
She’s a precious, smart dog
😂
You should actually do something for her food instead of pretending. You could pour some chicken or beef broth, mixed with some water or something onto the dry food. The dog wants something a little better than dry shit food from a bag. The dog KNOWS you, the massa, can do better than bland dry dog food. Now cook the dog some hamburger and mix it with the fat into his or her food.
I had a dog like. I had to pretend I was giving her something extra.🌺
I love that you make her feel special. ❤️🐾
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😊😊
Hilarious! 👍🤣💦💦
I love that, she's so cute!
Absolutely insane, funny!❤
faker
She's beautiful and wants the same way you cook everyone else's..❤😊
Hilarious
😂
😂😂😂
She wants real food. Not that dry crap all the time. It's bad for them.
Its cute but please feed your dog some real food and not just dried kibble
Dry food is yucky! Try making her food or getting her the good stuff if you’re able to.
😂😅
I have one like that too!  I cant fool her though, I have to put something sprinkled on it.
❤❤❤MADE WITH LOVE GOOD GIRL 😊
I feel the pain mineisthe same way.
It was waiting for the special ingredient. Love
She is gorgeous,, just beautiful 🥺❤️
It’s that repetition that dogs like. Like others have saidShe has you well trained! And we do it !!😅
That's just too much DOGgone sense!
Dog be like...Do I taste garlic? Oooh perhaps some rosemary too? Good job on this one Mom. Lol.
Yeah dogs train us just like kids.The owner is fine
You’ve obviously changed a routine
It’s not done until you add the love miss work with them here
I had to put my fingers in it and say "mmm mmm good food" before my lil jack russel would eat. Miss my lil bizkit...
Presentation is everything lol
I need to do that for my dog. She has been starving herself because she didn't like where her bowl was
Owner is definitely abreast of the situation 😮
He s a good human trainer 😂
This makes me miss Kira so much.  It was actually Bentley that I had to have special rituals for at the end but still... <3
Dog is too heavy anyhow
Or maybe just get something different, dogs may not like to eat the same old thing
Our last k9 had a funny routine. We would put down his dish, and he would sit there and talk to it. I mean mumbling, yelping, a couple of barks. That would go on until some would yell “Trey!, just eat it” then he’d eat.  I really wish someone would have recorded it. My wife always said he was saying grace.
Lol.
No gravy
hope you do feed her wet food too as dry dog food isn't that good for animals just cheap and easy for their humans.
My dogs would not let me get away with that. ❤ too smart. So funny. 💕 😊
HaHA 😂!!!!!!!!
My German Shepherd did the same thing to me except it was he needed his food to either be wet in some gravy or have a bit of white rice. Lol 😂
Prepare mine as you do yours please😅
she wanted the due attention and care to her meals
Look at the dog watching what she is doing😂😂😂
I thought that my dog was spoiled!
You have her spoiled rotten!! So funny. You have to put the special sauce in and chop some onions and garlic and put them in. Too cute but I know how we spoil them.
ppl pay for the sizzle, not the steak
So cute,she can't help it she wants love on a silver platter wow
Because dry crap
Smart but not that smart
who is worse the dog or you putting in all the effort to fake it
What a sweet, stupid dog!  😂
The German Shephard is watching and thinking! I'm not sure what she is doing but I want my food prepared the same way! Lol!
Thats Hilarious!
It’s too dr. Add a little meaty topper to it
Well maybe the owner needs to stop feeding her fur babe crap biscuits / dry food.
😅🤣😂🤣😅🤣😂she wants to know  her meal is  prepared like everyone elses..Smart😂🤣😅🤣😂🤣😅
😂😂😂
I have to do the same thing for my dog
lol
Mine will only drink fresh water and can smell the difference
I have one of those too 😊
Precious n innocent
Just leave it there for a couple of days, and she will eat it. Stop letting your pet train you.
She is beautiful ❤,  I would just give her what she wants anyway.
Yes, we have the same deal...😅
Pavlovs dog?
I LOVE her!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 that is funny
No. Your dog is just waiting to let him eat.
She’s just hoping for some gravy on it!!
The sad thing is, we actually do that for our two and they won't even consider eating just kibble. 😂  Two of the most spoiled pugs ever but, they are nice and slim and really active so, guess it's a good trade!
She a GIRL..  WANTS THE BEST  HIGH CLASS MEALS...
You spoiled the dog...
I have his cousin living with me. Lol Along with the special meal he won’t drink water unless he has ice in it. But he’s a good boy
Mine does same crazy thing, whether I add anything or not. Also at EXACTLY 7:00AM and 5:00PM!  She won’t let me sleep in (jumps on and off bed constantly) and she pouts if I’m late.
She’s got u trained🤣
LOLOLOLOLOLOL I LOVE IT!!!!!!
Taught her that you love her and now she thinks you forgot
😂😂😂
I add chicken or beef broth over dry dog food. My dog loves it.
You should be giving her more balanced meals and hydrate the kibble with warm water for 10 min before so its not as bad on her stomach! You wouldn't like that or choose that to be the only thing u ever ate. So many people feed bigger dogs like that stuff like kibble and cans or dog food their whole life which is shit for them u can maybe feed smaller ones shit like that but should really feed them all raw with some hydrated kibble to make it a fatter fuller meal!
The magic ingredient is love.
lmao
You screwed up from the beginning somehow
WHO TRAI ED WHO? LOL😂❤❤
Shepherds are the best😆😍
HA she’s thinking my mama sure can cook.
Alsatian is beautiful and identical to a pet we had when I was a child growing up in Dublin/Ireland....RIP Fang !!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
she is not your dog, you are her human.
The dog is intelligent, unlike its owner.
😂😂😂❤❤❤
Start worrying when your mini poodle demands to be hand feed.  Will go all day without food till she is hand feed. And yes the 13 year old corgi must have the correct bowl, on the correct “placemat”, in the correct position……..yep. My dogs aren’t spoilt..🤯
Omg...so cute!!!!
That dog is over weight. Look how wide it is. No ribs are showing, no hip structure showing. That dog will eat when it gets hungry. You are feeding the dog too much food.
Presentation and preparation make food better always
My dog is exactly the same way.  If I give each kibble kernel to her one by one, she eats it because she thinks it’s a treat😳😳😳. SMMFH🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Dog would starve fucking around with me smh
😂😂😂
I’ve got a cat who is exactly the same way.
The best dogs ever😊
❤😂My dog is the same way !!!
Poor thing!!
Kibble is horrible these days.  I agree with the dog.  Add some raw meat and vegetables
My Shepherd wouldn't eat steak without me seasoning it & grilling it just the same as for the adults. One day, my Mom mad him a steak. He was sooo excited. He ran to his dish. Smelled it. Looked at me who had just come home from work. He poked his nose around the bowl, then turned his damn DOG nose up at my Mom's cooking! I took the steak, grilled it so it had "lines", smothered it in BBQ sauce, threw on some Montreal Steak Spice, then offered him the steak. He was so grateful. I got a lot of messy kisses in between his bites. He had NO time for my mom for about a week. Btw, it was round steak -  cheapest in Ontario Canada. I made the humans the t-bones. Dogs crack me write up but while we had that dog, we also had a cat. That cat walked so casually to the kitchen table to a left over burger and just snatched it and tried to sneek off! Animals & kids. That's my jam. ❤❤❤
I thought our dog was spoiled😂😂
Why my dog is the same way! And we have to stand there and watch him eat or he won’t eat at all!
That is terrible 😂😂😂😂
And she absolutely deserves it ❤❤❤❤😂
my dog does the same. it is what happens when you give them table scraps.
German shepherds are fantastic dogs
Got her snowed.  My princess is a connoiseuse.  If there’s no egg, or dollop of yogurt, or (at least) some treat-dust from the bottom of the cookie jar, I get more of “the look.”
I’m gotta try that shit ❤
I demand to be breast fed
Lol
Girl, my dog didn’t eat for three days just because I didn’t pretend like I was eating the same food, I was serving her.
😂😂 I love German shepherds 😂😂
Too cute😅😅😅
We make real food like beef, brown rice,  veggies and mix with a little kibble then Eat! Yes they want human food too.😂
A smart leader would just stop doing the silly ceremony  that is a waste of time and wait for the dog/bitch to eat, eventually it will eat because of hunger. This is just silly, like how you would treat a child or something. Stop it.
What a ❤ beautiful doggy !!!
So you tricked her into eating the food. She probably wanted some water in that empty bowl. But you did say “her” so I guess a batch is a bunch is a bees. Way to figure it out ladies.
Its  funny that you do it too cute im guilty of it myself  I cant stop laughing
Lol
That's not nice! 😮
awe...lol...
Why is a red empty cup upside down in his feeding area???????
So is this the trick? I never thought I would need to convince a dog to eat, yet I have to instruct her to eat. What gives?
Smart doggy ❤
"you cook for the kids so I want you to "cook" for me" xD
Well how about I just give you a piece of bread and bologna that's it. Specially if you have had better than bad.
😂😂😂😂
Reborns had a German Shepherd collie mix that he would not eat his food until he had salt pepper and if you didn't put the garlic on it he wouldn't touch it I don't care what it was if he didn't put Garlic on it he would not eat it
She's got you where she wants u!😅😅
My dog wont eat off the bowl, she scrapes them with her paw to fall on the floor then she eats.
Its like giving your drug seeking patient a saline flush and calling it morphine then watching them calm down and go to sleep 😂😂
My cat does the same thing.
Pre Dinner ritual 😂
Dog is stupid 😅
Very succulent
That's service😊
LOLLLLL
She wants homemade home-cooked food
My dog absolutely can tell the difference. One sniff and she looks at me like "are you serious "
All pets deserves better food than decimated cancer animal by-products ie:kibble.
Hilarious
when this dog watches this short, ur in a lot of trouble.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think I need that special treatment tooo
That’s GOLD ❤
Beautiful girl has you whipped. Next week we'll see what teicks you can do 😂
She’s family too ❤
Add Ketchup
Please not drid shite again
Green top spices really add a lot of flavor. That dog is a genius.
They Train Us
I wish my dog would be happy with a couple fake moves! Im stuck feeding those spoiled babies meat and rice!
I wouldn’t mind watching her cook 😉
Who wants to eat that boring food anyway.
We have a tiny chihuahua who does the same exact thing!!
Loyal: Yes Smart: occasionally Loyal: Yes
Special invisible food, for catching ghost at night 😢😂😢🎉😂❤.
The dog just wants your special love and affection added into it 😂 bless her
She is not ridiculous she smart maybe you should cook her dinner one day 😢
She needs more than dry food 🍲 she is very hungry 😢
She's high class!
This is just precious...
This dog is scary smart.  how can you give her a meal without chopping and stirring?
OMG
Glad shes not spoiled
She just wants her food made with love.🥰
Dogs won’t eat if you’re in the area. Your top dog and their subordinate. Kittens puppies and unicorns
Your baby is spoiled
When your dog is making sure you make a fool of yourself on video, for the world to see how much you DONT care about her health. Who would feed this junk daily to their pet?! Would you eat dry food in pellet form for the rest of your life?
Wow! That's a smart diva dog 😂
Ugh you are. Poor baby thought you where giving her good. You eat the same thing your whole life
My dog is the same way, too much chicken and rice 🤦‍♂️
Who spoiled her
They are very smart and precious!!! ❤ ❤ ❤
My cats do the same thing 😅
You thought the dog that yourself, even if you never meant to do it 😂
well that’s a dick move
Now how did she come about insisting she's worth it!!!? Who taught her that Mom??  She knows she's special and deserves it!!!
Dog smarter than owner
P😊progra holy
The dog trained her so well!  Good job doggie! 😂😂😂
Oh no 😂❤
I think she might hate you .... She KNOWS by scent you didn't do ANYTHING .... for her it's just another day of you letting her down.. Notice the lack of actual levity or in English .... not much tail wagging going on.
You should have  made it gourmet. I would!why have some bland ass dog food every night.  He is hoping one day you will get it…would you like to eat the same thing every night of your life ?
SMART VERY SMART😂 BEAUTIFUL ❤
The baby knows human food tastes better
She wants to see her food receiving the same kind of love and careful preparation, that her people's food receives. Smart girl! 😊
She just wanted you to put a little love into her meal. 😂
😂❤
It’s like my mom’s obese cat...she won’t eat a bowl of perfectly good food if we don’t stir it or throw it out and add more.
I do the same thing!
Some humans act like that too some TIMES. Especially when they pay $1,000 for some steak 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Excellent con job!!   Congratulations.   😂
Your mean
Extra Love is always delicious
I'm on the dog's side...
Wow look at this meal. 😅
That dog is pampered 😂
She wasnt going to eat till you garnish it like you aleays too
Blame the owner for being weird, not the dog
Sad life
It’s all in the preparation and the presentation she is correct🤣
jajaa this is hilarious !!!
😂😂😂 Beautiful
This here pooch has no water in his bowl madam
😅😅😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
This pup is so cute! And your a great mom to make her/him feel special
Why not make them some simple chicken breast
We used to give water w oirs
Put a raw egg on the bowl
Mine does the exact same thing
😂😂😂
Spoiled😂😂😂😂
Cute dog. What's up with the Red Solo cup?
German shepherds are the best.
His love language is acts of service
That’s just so fun and how great of you to continue to do that for her
big puppy
Right but you trained her to wait for this routine
My dog does the same thing smh
We had a large dog who wanted cat food just a little on top was not good enough we had to stir it in still not good enough we had to put where the cats good munch on a few bits.
Not telling you what to do …Do you ever put raw or family scraps food in the bowl?  I believe straight kibble is not a great dog fud. My dog gets both raw and cooked as toppings. Such a cute dog
She wants that special touch that only her dog mom can provide!
That's my dog, Gru.
Well maybe you should make a real food and stop giving her trash kibble
Ma’am…your dog is blk 😂😭💀 just the cutest.
...if it's hungry, it'll eat. Y'all do too much 😂
My little Maltipoo will NOT eat dry dog food, unless I spoon feed him, or put some in my open hand.
Funny❤
That’s amazing.. dogs really are aware
My cat is the same way.
Lololololol
If you did that once before she’s waiting for you to do it again and again and again.
Let see you eat a bowl of cheerios with no milk! Everyday forever!
😂 ❤ tht, what we do for our doooogs 😘
Thats too funny. I have to do the same thing lol
😂❤
😂😂😂🎉
God people are stupid AF if they don’t realize you poured chicken broth on top or underneath and use Final Cut Pro to edit ur video to cut out you putting that or chicken underneath.  Give this a 👎🏻 for treating you like a fool 💯
😂😂😂 lmao shes like listen, yall get your meals prepared, I'd like mine done the same please and thanks 😅😂😂
Same here
Mom, you are absolutely a sweetheart if that’s the way to make me you go girl❤
Spoiled rotten!❤
So I'm not the only one that has this problem 😆
You sound like our camala toe Harris
Aww she’s not ridiculous
Imagination is more important than knowledge - Albert Einstein
😂😂😂😂😂
Lovely
Yikes.
boobs
Growing up most nights mom used the electric skillet for dinner.  She would clean out the skillet but before washing would mix our dogs kibble in the skillet then feed them.  Yep, had to start always mixing the kibble in the skillet even if there was nothing in there.
😂spoiled much
I want a German Shepherd
Her big ingredient is some glands 😅😮😅
How high should I jump 😧😵‍💫
My dog is the same way but I actually chop something up and put it into the bowl. If you have to do the motions why not actually give them something?
One of my 4 German Shepherds LOVED it when she saw me chopping ANYTHING on the cutting board. I realized that in the past, I would throw her a bite of a carrot many, many times when cutting them up, & occasionally, I would drop a tiny piece of chicken or beef or pork or steak, if it required cutting up, once it was cooked. So after that happened, &  not even that many times, ANY TIME we pulled the cutting board out for ANY reason, she would lay down in the kitchen & before long, if it smelled good, she would start to drool. Lol
You're convinced your bra is adequate lol.that kinda ridiculous
Leave that bowl there . The dog will get hungry and eat.
Why are white folks so obsessed with k9s
Yummy mommie, thank you for my special meal.
This is beautiful, doggo be like this simple ish mess with my system😂
most dog food is garbage and dogs know that.                                 I cook for my dog!
Llz
Y dog are the same
Nice puppies yah have there!  The dog is cute too.
I'm wondering how she learned what the dog wanted.
She loves her nonsense
That's a cute video my dog's sense of smell and taste is vastly stronger than a human. That would never fool that dog open 20 bags your dog doesn't move open a bag of chips your dog four rooms away is flying through the house to get to you
Dog is making their own video how to train a human.
my dog is exactly the same
She's probably hoping that you put some carrots or some beef or something in it other than the dried yuck that our poor dogs have to eat 🤣🤣🤣 But I give you an a for patience a good Mama
Probably your big cans have this popular
🙌 best mom in the world ❤
😂😂😂😂 my dog does the same thing thing you her a little some special one day they expect it everyday .. .. priceless
Now that's funny right there I don't care who you are 😂😂😂
Fat dog got you trained.
😂😂😂😂
@Localish  She’s a good girl and a real sweetie.  She deserves something better and more nutritious to eat than that dry garbage you’ve been giving her.  instead of making a pretense of it why don’t you actually fix her something better to eat???
That dog wants a home cooked meal.
She likes fine cuisine.
Lmao unbelievable but has u trained well
Too funny
how about the ridiculous person that started the whole fiasco In the first place.
like my cats. The bowl is filled but they prefer to wake me up so i could present it to them 😂
She doesn't want to take your fun away from you!  She knows how it means to you to fix her food everyday!
Lol! Why you do that?? 🤣 jokes on you!
My grandfather taught me to always put a little warm water in kibble. It makes the "gravy" kibble dehydrates your dog. Especially larger breeds.
I used to have to scratch my Shepards cheeks before he would eat..lol
This is beyond cute 😂😂😂❤
What you do for your baby's. I do bthe same thing
Well trained huuuman
YEP that's  a G.S. for ya lmao😂😅 she's trained you well mom lol❤😂
😂😂
OCD DOG
Trust me i can relate home girl they are interesting creatures your dog might have got jealous of seeing someone or something getting special treatment before
Cute
You have added the ingredient Love. That is sweet.
i think is the other way around, she just likes to troll you every time  lololol
She is so cute and spoil😊😊😊😊
Poor dog, give that dog a steak.  LOL
My Yorkie has to have his eating bowl in a certain position in the area where I feed him. He will whine until  I come and place it where he wants it on the bathroom rug.
always hear about how smart dogs are
So you should think about it. She's wanting something better than that nasty dry food.
Please tell me you don’t just feed her kibble…
Dog has seen too many _gourmet_ dog food ads😊
Diva dog . LOL You know what though it doesn't cost you a dime and making her feel special is well worth it.
my german shepherd acts very much like this
LOL my Chiweenie wouldn’t eat anymore . So I put his regular food into his Puzzle treat feeder and guess what? My Fur Baby ate every little crumb!!
We had an old dog years ago that got ill and we helped himmeecover by giving him milk. From then on he wiuldnt drinkneater unless it had a drop of milkminnit, or we at least pretended to put milk in his water.
😂😂
You have a great rack...
That is hilarious. My Boxer would eat anything, even sampling what was in the cat's litter box. Yuck!
That’s fucked up
She she's not ridiculous you are. She watches you cook for your family and she sees you dump a bowl of that tasteless dry food. Cook some food and give it to the dog. Smh
😂😂😂
She’s hysterical 😂😂😂
ASMR dog
LOL, My dog is the SAME way
Those nukes bags are big enough to destroy the entire western hemisphere
Because your husband put some real meat in with the dog food and the dog has become  accustomed to it.
Cheapskate! 😮
😂❤
Hysterical, cute and precious.
Hilarious
Thats messed up to only feed the dog dry dog food. You should cook him chicken and noodles and eggs with toast bites and sausage for breakfast like i do
Animals are a trip
So sweet!
My dogs demand water in theirs too lol
SubhanAllah 😂😂😂
Every dog has its day in your case the dog has days like this😂😂😂
The dogs like, my poor owner is insane and pretends to you things. But I will make their life good and pretend for them.
It probably tastes bad unless you change it. let that dog get some flavor
😂😂😂😂😂
She just wanted you to add a little love
Dog's arw already smart but this is idk 🤷‍♀️ evolution G's
Maybe he should be eating more than just dry kibble
Just like a child. So sweet
‘What do you think I am? An animal?’
That’s very cute.  My cat won’t eat unless I chop and mix the food with a little water.  “Look, delicious gravy just as you like it”
is she putting CBD in his food?
Sad … just wants real food not flavored state shit …
So spoiled❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My two dogs won't either.
😂❤😂❤😂❤
That must be a modern female dog. They like delusion.
Just give her a steak!
😂😂😂😂
Does not have very much food in bowl!!
Omg that’s hilarious 😂
❤they want love
She was just waiting for the special ingredient you know love and I believe you give her a lot of it
If the dog is smarter than you, stay away from them! My GSDs don't do this.
That's hilarious!
Our boxer is the same way.  Needs an empty pot to pour air on it.
Just give her something better than dry crap for christ sakes.
My dogs did the same thing 😂
Sorry I missed the whole video what was it about? Was I the only one distracted here🤔🙈
Sad that we live in a day and age where feeding omnivores such processed food day in and day out while we put meat on our own plates is somehow okay, that is what is really ridiculous.  Not to mention eating the same thing every single day.  Just imagine eating spaghetti everyday for the rest of your life.  :'(  Give your furbabies some real meat.
It was missing something… love
You say she is ridiculous but I see the love you put into the imaginary ingredients.   MAMA YOU LOVE THIS LITTLE PUP!!😂😅😂
She's telling you: don't give me shitty kibble, make something good for me!
I have to put my dog bowl on the stove and pretend like I'm cooking it!😂
I used to be human….
You know WHY?   Because it's EXTREMELY DEAD FOOD...try offering some RAW hamburger and watch the dog's reaction.   REAL human grade meats...not crap from a sack...DEAD FOOD.  Look UP what's REALLY in pet foods.  Garbage IN...garbage OUT.
And here I thought it was only my border collie that expected a specual meal. And yes, our pets train us well😂!!
Damn you phat!!
What a Sweetheart of a Pupster. She just wanted the same special meal treatment she sees you put into the rest of her packs family food so she knows SHE is so a special member of the pack and Loved. What a Cutie Patootie! ❤💞💕🥰
The dog trained her well lol. You to do what I like for me to eat- Dog
WELLL... YOU DID IT ..  also.. she's one hot Mama
Hahahha Yall made her like that
My dog still wouldn't have eaten it.. he can smell that there was nothing added.. vice-versa if I add medicine he won't touch it or literally picks around it lol.. but I still love him
Too FUNNY ! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I do that for my dog too
Good human, very welll trained.
Clever dog lol.Making the owner jump through hoops as she watches from afar😂
Maybe she wants actual food instead of processed dry dog kibble?
What can I say? I love German Shepherds. The rest has already been said here.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Quick tip, don't start doing this for fun or else you have gotten yourself another chore   speaking from experience...
My cat does the same shit!!!!
my dog does that same thing...but i didnt see a dog in the video at first...
Doesnt know the truth!
🐾🐾She's A Sweetheart - She DESERVES Special Gourmet Additions To Her Dry Food!!!
Dry dog food his whole life...horrible
WOW!!!
Dogs are heaven sent !
I can relate. My cat is similar. It depends on where the bowl is placed if she will eat or not.
Actually u can make regular meas than thisbagage ones some times, kibbel bad
That is too funny!!! My dog is the same exact way. When he thinks I’m doctoring up something good he thinks I’m giving him human food.😂
She has some huge knockers 😊
Aww so cute😊
Imagination ingredients is the best😂😂
lmbo
Tice nits
What did you put in it, i have a real picky eater, she used to eat dry but stopped, please give recipe.
My dog does that to and he is a German shepherd
U should really rehydrate dehydrated dog food and maybe give your 4 legged sons or daughters some real food bc idk about u but I wouldn’t want to eat processed dehydrated food for my entire life, things like chopped carrots, sweet potato, potato, and meat ground beef and meat your dog is designed to ingest meat let them have some I’m not saying take away the dehydrated stuff just mix some real stuff with theirs
She is gorgeous. We all have our quirky ways. ❤
She wants real food..
I used to have to fake microwave for mine.
I think the dog is trying to tell you something
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am convinced of this, ANIMALS are reincarnated people, theh can't commuj8cate ñike they used ro but they retain aspects of their humanity
So cool beautiful Shepherd
Ive watched this about 12 times
U made it that way though, useless waste of time
I love that..your a great mom     ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂😂😂
Give her real food. My dog loves Farmers Dog. He’s a different dog. Happier, no more limping, no more gas, quit licking his paws. He jumps up ready for the day. Age 14
Jupp das muss ich öftes machen
Stop feeding this dog crappy kibble. Give the dog actual food. Meat, fruit, vegetables, eggs
Lol. I do the same thing for my dog Grayson. Spoiled ...❤😊
My dog does the same thing!
😮😮😮im calling peta, she deserves a better home 🤣🤣🤣
My cats the same with his routine. Good job there cute lol
She is part of the family and wants what you got she is beautiful and I love her.. she is no dummy
Nah, you’re the problem. You trained the dog to expect that. You could retrain it, and you could just give the food the way it is, and the dog will eventually eat it. But you choose to do that extra nonsense because it makes you feel like you’re needed.
With all due respect she deserves more than crappy dry food. Maybe if you gave her actual food, she wouldn’t need to pretend like you actually care about what you’re feeding her.
Same 😂😂😂😂
Champ won't eat unless you say Amen!
Sooo cute hahha
Dry food for a fantastic dog like that !!! Dear oh dear … 😢
😂 very similar to what i do for my chi
I love her. I would actually make her ground turkey with some rice and veggies. I did that for my Lab boy. I miss him so much, my baby.
😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂
this explains my dog in every possible way😂😂
That just like a mother dose with there small kids when they act fussy at eating time and as the kid gets older mam let’s the young adult se how it was really done
Visualization is one of the ways to success and happiness :)
😅 don’t care about the dog down bad
my doggie does the same thing so adorable❤
She was waiting for you to show us your cameltoe.
She's ASKING for fresh-ish dinners!
This dog.....is a cat!
She's a CHEF
Why don't you put something good and real in the food? If you really loved it, you would  do  it.  ￼
Thats funny mine does the same
That's funny. It's laughed so hard I hurt my sides 😂😂😂
Bahahahaaaa!!!
*hooman:* _here's your food_  *dog:* _no. do it with love._
People need to stop letting their pets watch tv😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love this dog ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
And they say animals are stupid. Yeh right. This woman proves how stupid humans are.
It's a german shepherd thing . Mine does that too.
💯
She is a Diva!  I love her! ❤️🤗
Mine won't eat until I put a fruit loop in it.
My dog would of looked at me‼️
lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
All  my 7.huskies too. LMAO oh its great. Mmm
I wouldn’t want to eat that kibble garbage for every meal either, my dog eats the farmers dog .
Children these days , lol
Wow, I love it❤️
Awesome! Both Dog and Human are awesome!  My wife has to pretend to eat the food and say “Yum”.. lol
Mine insists on being fed with a spoon or fork. And it needs to be whatever we have on our plate. No dog food and no dog dishes!
Wow that was a waste of a video
Hope you have her something good after teasing poor dog
Dogs Rock!
her food was missing the "LOVE" and she made sure to add it 😂
I had to do this with my lab!  😂❤
I find this so cute haha.I wish I had a pet ❤
that's OCD in the dog.
😂😂😂❤
Love it
She ain't being ridiculous she's got you trained in giving her a show 😂
😂😂
Your dog wants raw meat! She knows innately that dry kibble is hugely inadequate!
Maybe some people food as oppose to dry crap … chicken , carrots , . Your dog is trying to tell you something .. 😊😊
Who's the silly one 😂😂
Someone spoiled her!😂😂😂 Have you had her since she was a puppy, or is she a rehomed/rescued dog?
She been on tiktok
Our German Shepherd will not eat until I sit down in front of her. Then she gobbles it right up.
Mrs pavlov?
Oh yeah, that’s much better! Yummy yum yum Slurpy slurp slurp
This is hilarious 🐕😂😂😂😂
She wants to taste the love
He is telling you how sick he is eating the same food everyday....
Feed her proper food , stop tricking her and feeding her junk. Cook up veggies and real meat , thats what she wants.
My dog found out this trick and still didn’t eat the kibble. He likes a pinch worth coconut oil in his kibble or he won’t eat!
yup my buddies german Shepard is the same way !!! spoiled
😅😅
I'm looking at real food 🌝🌝
I wouldn't want to eat that either but it's funny
I love when pets manipulate you😂
You understood the assignment just like you cook your food I want my stake chopped up
Poor precious, beautiful dog..... Hopefully she/he always get everything real out of his imagination 😢😢😢
The missing ingredient was love 🙏🏽
She is a  supervisor watching her well trained human lol
Not enough water in the bowl
Did you actually add anything? Didn’t look like it.
What a stupid fuckin dog 😂😂😂
my take is the dog actually wants real food not that pebble stuff. He prob gets so hungry seeing you acting like you’re making real food that he just accepts what you put in front of him
They're SO worth it.
She has watched the way you prepare your own food, she’s Family and expects the same.😊
That is such a gorgeous German Shepherd!😀
My cat refuses to eat unless i scoop the food out of the can and place it in her cat bowl!
I have to trick my boy like this
he probably likes the cutting board scent on his kibbles
She’s perfect!❤❤❤
😂
Our lab won't eat until we say grace then say amen!!!
Guess what? This might even work on fussy children, husbands or boyfriends!!! Lol!!!😂😂
And yet it's still dry and tasteless. Have you tried giving her vegetarian recipes?
Or you stop the foolishness and let her starve herself until she realizes that there are treats and then there is dinner. Learn the difference.
That is the most adorable dog “thing” that ive seen in ages!
If she ever needs a home, she can.come to my house. I love her. ❤❤❤
So you gotta ACT like you making other food so she can eat her food?!! Get off the gaaaaassss, bruh 😂
LOL. SO FUNNY
Poor dog,would u eat that ?!
try different food
Spoiled  big time.
Nah that dog got a lot of table food shes just trying to pretend she doesn't, but it shows in your dogs behavior, the dog doesn't lie or try to  shade stuff
Thats great
Lol
The dog loves the smell of chopped onions and seasoning.
My dog is so spoiled.  1/3 of his food is moist food mixed in with his hard food. You dog probably knows the really good stuff is cooked.
dog wants meat, not chemical kibble.  what a horrible lady for tricking her dog into an unhealthy diet.
She trained this dog for this stupid video
You cook for the family, 🤷🏼‍♀️😀 HE IS FAMILY 👍🏽🥰
😍😍😍😍😆😆😆
Cats are like that too and he just waits for her watching like “I’m waiting”😅
❤❤❤so cute gsd have a special place in my heart my ex had one and i sobbed when lady was pts 😢many many years ago 😢
Just a spoonful of love helps the kibble go down. 😊
So cute.
It will eat, just ignore it how you ignore the signs that your dog is overly spoiled and IS REFUSING TO EAT if you don’t prepare the food the way the dog wants it. A normal dog thats not spoiled rotten will rush to anything you drop on the ground, let alone put in its bowl. I hate the way dogs have become a replacement for children. Anyone who thinks this is cute is the same as this woman, your dog is the head of the house.
What a good girl!
The dogs laughing inside. “Got my human to do human tricks before I eat.” Dog thinks he’s at hibachi
That dog must have lived with non white people before and just wants some spices in its food.
We have a German shep too. They're kind of derpy sometimes.
My dog would look at you like you have lost your mind.....
Words are not enough......so adorable 😍
Even the dog has affluenza
😂😂😂
Vegetables, please?
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Lol 🤣👍
That is so funny!!! 😂
To be fair: are we really so much different???
Oh gawd!  🙄  I feel you... 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂
Mia😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂assasssssssssssssssssssssssss😢
Good job mom. 👏 👍 😂 no way I would have figured out to trick the dog maybe squirt some ketchup on it😅
lol
The dog has good taste. Too bad she has to eat dry kibble.
My dog does the same
My dogs the same , if I feed the cats before him he won’t eat
What’s ridiculous is the owner😊
Nah...😂
You are an asshole give that dog a treat
❤❤❤❤❤
She's watching every move you make.  I love the ding of the microwave.  Nothing like a home cooked meal!
I say it allways: Dog are like little children... 😂
Our dog is the same way!!
😂😂😂😂😂 this was funny.
Autistic dog.
My dog is the same way but instead of fake preparing a meal i have to give a certain amount of back scratches and then hand feed the first 3 or 4 pieces lol
Thats historical ❤😂
If you ever gave her something off the table like that, the association is made
WERKS FA HIM AND ME 2. 😂😂😂😂😂
That's So Funny!
The magic ingredient: love.
Must have been bidens dog
😂❤🎉
Handsome Gorgeous animal Owned one for 15 years 🌼🥲🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾
I have one of those too.
Too funny 🤣🤣🤣
How did you get her into this habit . There's obviously a reason why she's like this .She wouldn't do this for nothing
That’s not dog food
Shepard's are smart so she will figure it out someday! That's funny tho.😅😅😅
I could be way off here but, who is ridiculous? She didn’t get into that habit without human help! Am I right?
😂😂😂😂
😂
Its pack behaviour, your recognised as pack leader and it doesn't eat until your done eating and playing with the carcass. Cats can have this behaviour as well. Use to have a female cat that did this and wouldn't eat until I touched the food and walked away.
That is hysterical
In the dogs eyes, the food was made with “love”
She licked her lips like, "yeahhh, sauce it up fa maeeeee."
🤣🤣 WOW. Now that is the true definition of a 5 star B****😂
No....Dog is cute and you are ridiculous ...:)
My dog has never fell for that trick
It's important !
Processed garbage
The more time other animals spend with humans , the more neurotic they get ! 🤣🤣
Give the dog some decent food. All dry food is horrible.
You must have previously done these steps in order to get her programmed this way?
This is great. Made my day. ❤
You're SO hot 🔥! ❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The dog probably thinks your cooking is getting worse but is to polite to tell you.😂😂😂😂
Momma gotta put her foot in it first!😂
You have him spoiled sure not for you both love each other So lovely 💕💕⭐️⭐️
She wants you to season it with love
I had a cat that wouldn't eat till you pet it while it ate. It wiuld shimmy like it was having a big O. Had to do it again and again.
Stirred not shaken..
Just start feeding her the same food you eat. She deserves it. 😅😅😅
Put some real veggies in there 😂
Show them🫒🫒
sheperd you gotta love them!!!! mine 2 are super picky
😅
hahah, i like how she in the bkgrnd watching you prep.
A little vinaigrette and chopped veggies? My former dog knew when he would eat because I chopped carrots and apples into his bowl and he knew when I got the carrots for him, especially (he came around the kitchen checking out the situation). He never thought when I chopped veggies for our meals that he was eating.
😂😂😂😂😂
Raw food and bones and vegetables and fruit is way healthier than that process junk
Hahahaha!
Haha！ I have one dog like that too， she think she is special, she wants to get treat special.
If you spoil it don't expect a difrent autcom
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Nice condescending tone, what a nice person you are
I was watching her chest more 😂
Stop treating her like a step child and add them invisible ingredients already.
It’s missing  the love! Food always tastes better when prepared with LOVE 💕 🤗
I heard somewhe that a dog has roughly the same intelligence of a human child.  This works on children too.
This is definitely how our family dog is😂
😂😂😂😂
She is waiting for the special ingredient: Mommas love 😂😂😂
Wow your dog was spoiled with genuine nutritional ( probably really expensive) food. And, shocker. He likes the shit that's not cereal based
Yeah, that is a spoiled dog, but she knows what she wants
Keep it there till she eats
Why don’t you feed your dog you claim to love some real food instead of poisoning it with that garbage from a bag.
Come on now---you used to feed her steak tartare and then you stopped.  She is trying to get back to that special meal you used back when she was younger.
😂😂😂😂😂 wat a dog
Wow😂😂😂😂
My 9 year old Pittie does this exact routine with us! He will also ignore his own food all day while watching and waiting to see what WE are having for our meals! Only if we ‘doctor’ his food bowl with scraps from our meal(s)  will he even consider eating his food!  Since when did we get a food critic for a pet?! 🤔😲🤨😂
I think that's cute😂😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰
Gotta have the Extra Virgin Olive Oil  😂
OMG! I dog sat my dog niece and did this to her- I pretended to spice up her food- the reaction was perfect! Guess who’s her favorite Tia? 😂
Smart dog even if you tricked to eat lol
Its all about presentation, its always about presentation...even with our food, presentation is everything.
Love this!!!!
I need to try this with my picky eater. How come she eats nothing, yet is rounder than her skinny brother who eats everything?
Just like a kid.   I’d love to know how,how in the world did you end up doing that?
Shorty could get it though.
So adorable 😍🥰😂😊❤!
lol.. cute… puppies have preferences as well….  I remember my Mom had a beautiful lab…. That dog would not drink water unless you put ice cubes in the water … lol
Dogs are people too!!
😂😂😂😂😂
Awe sweetie! She reminds me of our former MALE German Shepherd, they are so funny but so so loving. HE was my everything until he passed away at 10 1/2 yrs with us! I still grieve for him, over 8 yrs ago. We ADDED another GS To Our family, 3 yrs after, But We did not replaced him! We love our 2nd pup, as much as we loved him! And they both are the same because neither would eat unless we stood or stand right next to them until they finish eating, goodness😂😅😂😅
So sweet
Mine wants butter and grated parmesan on it
😂❤
Dog are use to routine 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
The baby wants to feel part of the same race a good home cook meal 😂❤
Kibble sucks She wants your food
I actually had to do that for my boxer. They figured it out!
THATS ODD AND FUNNY.
😂 I am dying❣️
Spoiled, but she is not as Spoiled as 6 pups. My pups get what her dog thinks she is getting
Love makes everything better
Bruh cuz the dog wants real food not processed shit all it’s life
He likes imaginary seasoning lol
No living thing should eat processed food for every meal for life.
😂❤
Head head gastric sleeve surgery my taste buds change so I can only drink Brita water mess around and gave my cat some one day now she only drinks Brita water the cat that went bougie
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This German shepherd colour is the best . ❤
🤣🤣🤣 my husky is the same way lol
My dog would be like WTF mom? Where's my chicken and rice and still not eat that plain kibble until it was actually mixed in. Fussy lil female pitty of mine but she's so worth it ❤
Why do white people put their dogs tray on their food counter 😂😂
😂
Dogs are dumb
Hilarious.   😊
Ask yourself how it started.
Everyone in here gets it except the poor dog's owner.  Imagine if, instead of _pretending_ to dress up the dog's dinner, she had spent the same amount of time actually improving it for her "ridiculous" dog.
Maybe your dog has to fantasise about extra food on top because she gets the same shit every day
My SHEPHERD loved broth  over her food. If I didn't put any, she would stand in front of the fridge to let me know
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've never had a dog that didn't like their food. Especially on the 2nd day of not eating it.
My GSD acts the same way when making her "gravy train" she runs in circles and barks like crazy.
What is that she put on the food?
😅
Bruh this woman is hot, the dog is probably stunned
Feeding your dog kibble is like you and me eating crackers and crap all day. This dog is NOT ridiculous!!!
Most dry food is literally garbage food for dogs and very unhealthy.
Thank you!! You made my day!!
She's so cute and I just want her how much do you want for her
Too cute 😂
She treats everyone of this house as family member. So, she will protect each one of you if needed. That's why she thinks, this is the way of preparing food.
Too funny we have to do the same thing lol. Sometimes yes and sometimes no!
Dog is not ridiculous just spoil big time
Your a great mama , who ever had this dog before you put things in his food he’s not ridiculous this is what he is used to
Thats a good puppy
I have a cat like that! 🙄
You conditioned that dog
Its in the perfotmance, wants their own special showing :)
They are smart dogs
I also have to do that with my dog
What's the red upside-down cup for?
Hahahahahaha! Love it!!
LOL LOL
Our pets, especially cats and dogs,  will develop human wants and needs, characteristics and habits, after time...
Imagine this woman being in charge of every meal you are. Dry supermarket biscuits for every meal. Disgusting
Love it!
Who is training who here, exactly?
😂😂😂❤
No dog or cat should have kibble for every meal. Ut shoukd be used only as fast food is for himans. And dry kibble damages theie kidneys. You should rehydrate it first with hot water. Then add something good that you cooked like a soup youve made for her.   She is not ridiculous in the least. Feankly you are
MY DAUGHTERS DOG DOES THAT TOO
The lady doesn't know the jokes on her. That dog is making her do extra shit for nos reason.
My dog won’t eat her dry food unless I add water to it and make a big production of it. If I don’t she just stares forlornly at her bowl and gives me the sad eyes.
It didn’t have mamma’s love in it ❤
Love This!! 😂😂😂
Exactly my dog. Every day I have to mix fresh veggies and chicken breast on top of his dog food
My 10 year old German Shepard does similar she has always had issues eating she will knock bowl over to hide the food or she will go off her food for days if we leave her for a day or were gone any changes and she just wont eat. Iv since given her to my mother as a service animal. She still has bad anxiety and will reflect her eating. If i put powdered chicken broth or gravy she will eat it but shes funny acts alot like this dog. Wonder if its a bread thing. My dogs almost 100 percent German Shepard she has a small amount of pitbull. Shes in great health as of her age and very smart German Shepards are smarter than any other animal iv had she is like a child to my mom. Anyone elce have any German Shepards like this? My ex had her sister for long time i think she passed away tho. They both  have sisative stomachs. We feed ours really healthy kibble with other things mixed in at times if needed. My ex i think couldn't afford good dog food so she couldn't get her to gain weight.
Reverse Pavlov? ‘Personification’? Where do we begin?😂
I have a tiny Yorkshire terrier who does the same my beautiful pepsi
AWESOME ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
cheating cheating cheating 😂😂😂
This dog has you very well trained!!  Who's ridiculous??
LOVE is the missing ingredient 😂❤❤
😂
Now put some can food in there & make some gravy for the girl!
Smart 😂
My dog does the same thing😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have the same issue with my cat! I have to pretend that I put something else in there and then she’ll eat it. They are unbelievable.
LMAO I HAVE 2 THAT ARE THE SAME WAY.  THESE FUR BABIES OF OURS ARE SPECIAL SPOILED AS HELL .  THANKS FOR SHARING😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤫🫣😝💯✌️
LOL. I have a CAT who won't eat until I sprinkle chopped-up treats on top!!
This is why they need a stranger to come into their homes to discipline their dogs 🤦🏿‍♀️ I can imagine what the kids do
Had to turn volume  down. But
LOL. I love it. Good trick. What a beautiful doggie.
"watch what i can make my human do"
She wants what the rest of the family gets
I completely understand what you are talking about. I  have 4 spoiled rotten dogs that are the same way. Mine are ridiculous asf they won't even eat a chip unless it's got dip on it. And they won't eat a chicken nugget without bbq sauce. Lmao  it's not their fault tho...it's mine. I have made them like that. We don't have anyone to blame but ourselves. But I wouldn't have them any other way. I love them more than anything. They are my world
amazing boobs
Hilarious‼️🤣😂🤣
Hahahhaha priceless, Mom knows❤❤
Is this really about the dog?
can you give a dog some good nutrition like beef vegetables stop using Purina it’s killing our dogs
Beautiful dog
She was waiting for you to put some love in it😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe she wants wet food
That’s your baby
Lol owner trains a dog a certain way and then tries to complain on Tik Tok when it follows the training regimen. Cute but ehhh...
How stupid is this dog. She didn't do anything to the food. How does this dog not know this?
Its all about putting in the work and not short changing the client😅
Dog has u more well trained than i have my kids...
Same here except its the dog and cat
You started that!
🥰
Give that baby some real food
Beautiful girl ❤❤❤
This is adorable. I love my dogs.
My boxer is like that. She's  actually turning her nose up and bored with smoked chicken
They just want to make sure what you are going to eat isn't better.
My dog won’t eat until I sit down and watch him eat 😂😂
It's not that she won't eat, it's because you are standing there observing, if you leave her alone and don't interact with her, eventually she will get hungry & will come to the point she says ok, I don't need no tricks or any of that mess to eat, I have to eat or I'll die!! That's the only way to break a dog from that type of cycle!!! Good luck & God Bless!!!
That's because you started doing that to the food in the first place.and so now it wants it every time
My German Shepherd tries to train me, also.
Spoiled by mom! 😅
🍼
What a big dog
She’s telling you her food is bad.  Give her some fresh food with that dried pulp.
Mr. Pavlov: Bell ✔️  Drool ✔️
lol you have spoiled her. so she’s use to you adding the whistle and bells to her food.
It’s the little thing about having a dog that you remember when they’re gone
Your a good mommy ❤
Rude and dishonest
My dogs are the same😅
Shepherds are Waaaayyy too smart😂🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Why don't you just make it delicious for her.
Lol. She just wants "the human touch to the service from someone she loves this makes her feel more loved."😊
$8 bottle of wine....into $200 bottle of wine
I have a cat, that does the same.❤ Makes them feel special 💯
The comments are cute...stupid...but cute lol ..im baffled at all the people who "THINK" they know what the dog is thinking lol 😂
I THOUGHT ONLY MY GERMAN SHEPHERD DID THIS 😭
My Doberman is the same way except he wants the real extras like olive oil and chicken
Hilarious..she wants the special food Mom makes for her.
My dog does this about half the time. We have salt, pepper and wooden spoon for stirring and a touch of water. I have to stir or he won’t eat it. 😅
The dog mom is hot ❤
My cat has a full water bowl but won't drink and will meow at me to change the water and then will drink.
Doggies have US trained!!! 😂😂😂
An intelligent dog!!!
I can't stop watching this😅😅😅😅😅
Should have soft food that healthy in there 😢
But you trained her to do that, so I guess it's what you have to do.
Mine does it too😅
What would we do without them?
Gordon Ramdog: It's raw!
Your dog knows that commercial dog food is so bad for dogs health lol
You should add water to every meal
Lol. 😂😂 Yes that does work. But some will be slick and smell it
She knows what she likes !! ..
Damn that husband is a lucky bastard🤣🤣
So cute
Too funny 😂
LMMFAO your girl is bougie.
Same dramatic routine in this house EVERY NIGHT!
see  ?  that makes all the difference 😊
I have to do the same crap with my dog. It's hilarious.
😂😂😂😂😂
Ok. She probably feels sorry for you because she sees you're blind & deaf.😅😅😅😂
I have to do the same for my cat😂
Well obviously you started it.
I don't feel alone 😊I have to put my dogs food in microwave for 15 seconds 😂😂❤
I love you and her so much.  I am still laughing!!!!  You adding make believe ingredients and going through all the motions.  U r the best.
That's mean. 😢
My dog would’ve been like “ hell naw, play in somebody else’s face” 😂😂😂😂
She said mom if you don't put your foot in my meal we about to have some problems. 😂❤
She saying”I got her again.l😂😂😂😂
The comments are extremely sentimental and infinitely ignorant of animal behavior.
it's called the Pavlov dog reflex. She has associated the sound of the spoon and the gesture/routine with being fed and that makes her salivate. It's in her memory blue print.
Glad to finally meet one of Pavlov's dogs
My Rotti was like that , I would open dice cabinet and pretend to add ingredients ..  was so funny
“Gourmet “😅
Even the dogs get it… they’re not happy with the modern woman… he’s saying care for me
What a sweet girl
Why don't you cook her a nice steak
I know it’s annoying but there could be worse problems than doing that. Sweet mama and dog! ❤
Wow amazing. Such a well trained human !
GSD's be GSD'S...LOL.
Mine is the same way too. 😅
😂😂😂😂😂
A girl can dream.😂
Give that baby regular food!  Burnt brown bits for every meal.
well you trained the dog to be so daft didnt you
She has you very well trained..
My dog is very similar lol
My dog is the same and will not eat dry food unless it has something added that came from my stove top, oven or refrigerator....
She knows what she wants 😉💕✨
😄😄😂😂😂😭😂🤣🤣🤣💯👍👍👍👍💖🙏poor thing. 👍
This dog wants Mommy‘s cooking like everyman does!😂
My dog acts like that just picky
Id let it nit eat
Screw the dog l want her to cook my meals in those shorts
She LICKS her mouth the MOMENT  the " Gourmet" upgrade begins 😂😂
I truly hope that's not that cheap sawdust dog food 😕
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dog starts savoring as soon as the sauce comes out
She’s just a girl living her rich life 😭🫶🏾🫶🏾
She was being clear. It must be made with love!!! Mum's love!
You're gonna be doing that for the rest of her life.....
But u sat there and did the goofy shit... ppl are crazy
Witchcraft ingredients.
😂
All that you may as well go ahead and make her a real meal ffs
GSD owner here. Mine won’t eat until I fake cut something with a knife and fake slide it into the bowl off the counter with the knife. I went so far as to keep a dull ceramic knife in the block so as to not damage anything. Mine will actually act terrified of his food sometimes or walk away after sniffing it and hide in a corner until I do this. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Give my pit a treat and she will drop it and wait for a second one before she eats and if she stirs her dry food and there is no wet mixed in she'll walk away.
Too funny!
Yep!😂 I have a 5 pound Yorkie like that. They have us where they want us
What’s ridiculous is you feeding that beautiful animal some dry ass kibble. Lil hot warm and she’ll really thank you
Spoiled Rotten on. She thinks she’s getting Human food Additives.
The dog is already spilled😂
Maybe you need to be more REAL,with her or more attention, so get to work lady😮
Lol when you jusy want to see a fuss made over you
My dog won’t eat his food unless I put it in the microwave 😮‍💨
My dog does exactly the same thing, but wants a little piece of cheese on top. It had three right in the same place. And we do it ❤
😂😅❤
....and VR cow gives better milk.
How cute!! 😂🐕‍🦺
She is like my owner is thinking I need this, but truth is I love making her be silly. How cute. Just teasing you. Beautiful Shepard.
Your dog is broken!!!😂😂
She just wants a little love added ma 😉
Presentation is everything
😂😂😂
She wants to be like you lol
😂 This is just so cute
When she fake poured the sauce  dog: 😋 Me: 😂😂😂
❤
Kind of funny but I hope you add some more stuff to it than just that dry food if not she's probably just trying to convince herself that she's not eating small pieces of flavored cardboard
She is reassured that she is REALLY a part of the family because she's eating the same food as everyone else.
Awsome
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
My dog is the same! 😂 I have to pretend it comes from the stove!😅
laugh my butt off that's ridiculous
And that's how even the human mind is being manipulated each second .
Special Dog love German shepherd s
I have to do this mor my 7-lber.
😂😂😂😂
Let me guess when you go for a walk with dog, dog runs infront of you and you have hold on to a dear life to that leash?
Eric porcaro
😂
Love it..
Spoiled ass dog 😂
Cheater!
Yuck kibble, poor dog eating that crap 💩
My heart
That is so cute.
great b.obs
Our lil spoiled man is the same way we have to heat his food for like :07 so that it don’t get hot and than he attacks it lol. We have a lil beaver yorkie
Ahaha
Imagine how happy she really would be if you gave her real dog food…instead of kibble.
She saw those other dogs getting steak and eggs on Social Media
We should actually put some olive oil in the food. It’s good for dogs also just like humans.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shake it up mom ..
Let's not pretend you made her that way. All the times you've fed her your food or "spoilt" her comes back to bite ya in ya ass.  That's if it really actually bothers U
This dog watches too much TikTok of the dogs getting those extravagant meals like rabbit ears and liver and other raw meats. He wanted the same stuff in his bowl
So u spoil the dog but the dogs fault 😂 women logic
Lol, my cat is like that. I have to shake it all up, pretend to smell it and say it's yummy and invie her to eat 😂
I LOVE GSD's they are the best, but they are stubborn!
She is precious!!!
Feed dogs real food, they are family... Remember? You wouldn't feed your kids cereal twice a day for ten years. Wait... Never mind, some of you do. 🙄
Wow, this lady needs help
How is that her fault? You introduced that to her and now she is spoiled… whose fault is it really now??
the ultimate betrayal. 🤣
That's so funny
Sleep with one eye open when she figures it out......
I love it tht is so awsome what a good pup shes a beautiful German Shepherd...
😂😂😂
Or away from the camera u told her not to eat so u can make it seem like u had to do extras so u can create content even tho it’s false lol
My K9 is the same way
He he he love it 😂
you're ridiculous, dog's need raw organ meat and your trick work's but it is killing your best friend with ridicule
She behaves like these woke people that wants special attention. Equivalant to "them".
It's the little things that makes us happy😊
OmG my cat does this!
You spoiling ya baby❤
😊😊😊😊
OmG,  just the cutest ❤
Just boil some chicken, shred it, put it in containers, and freeze it. Keep one in the fridge to warm up with water which makes a gravy. They’ll eat it up. I feel so bad for giving pups dog food every single day, change it up a bit.
That's the funniest case of placebo food I've ever seen.
I wish this worked on my dog ❤️🤣
So cute
I feel her pain my boy is so spoiled when we go on walks with him we say you wanna go for a stop 😅
🤣👍
Kibble everyday.  I switched to Farmers Dog!!  Kibble is bad. Ingredients are awful.
Not me picking up the fresh bowl of water and making fake water sounds so my cat will drink it 😅
Omg, my sister had a dog like this, hated leftovers, so I had to fake cook.😂😂
😂😂😂 i love it!
You properly prepared it for her, just like you do for you! It’s actually kids sweet❤
Omg...lol😅😅😅😅❤
Look at the bright side of it : this dog won’t ever be poisoned by anyone who didn’t watch this video. And yes, there are cruel idiots who poison other ppls pets, be it dogs or cats, we even had cases of razor blades hidden in meat that unsuspecting pet dogs would try to eat in some cities.. Best to put it online if you find something like that, so other pet owners can stay on alert
We want the love added by mom. everyone does.
Dogs do that, yes they do (:and so do their owners) including me
How do we know you didn't tell her not to eat and that's why she's sitting there waiting for you to give her permission? 🤔
How does this even start? 😂
She realizes something is not right.
My dog gets a topper and some warm water with his food, so he actually knows when I am being lazy and just give him dry kibble.
Pretty much the same as a kid.😂😂
All animals when we give that one tome treat....
Thats what you get for spoiling your damn dog. The dog woulda starved
The missing ingredient was ❤️
💋
Sweet 😅
I see something else that’s absolutely ridiculous! 😂
She's watching
Mmmmmm yummy...and I don't mean the dog food😏
Aw. Give her something nice to go with her kibbles from time to time 🥹
And what’s good dog mom your not lol love your pet because when it’s gone your gonna wish you did throw some scraps in its bowl that you would of just thrown away anyways
I find that kind of deceitful and if she ever figures it out that would break her trust in you.
Rich life 😂😂
Like my dog but a little bit diff cos my dog will only eat meat... Even if i mix it with something else he will only pick out the meat n eat
Guh you nice and thick
Make her a real gourmet doggy meal. She deserves the real thing 💗 when she’s gone you’d wish you had ✨
It's all about presentation
Don’t you ever treat me like a dog, treat me like a human
❤😂
😂
Dont forget to add the love
LOL . My dog has my number too.
Omg how cute
😭
Baby spoiled❤ she's special 💕
❤
My dog does this but is smart enough to know I didn't do anything to it
Doggy dog.  Sweet.
Tricking the dog into eating crap pellets!
Had a chick that use to fix me dinner the same way    now that i look back it may have actuly been the same food
That's called love, that is being added to the food
Precious baby she wants what you give others ❤
You are the only one who takes the time to do that,
I agree, i think she sees you cooking and eating and she wants to feel apart of, its so cute. Buy i can see how it may be annoying once in a while lol
your doggy is wonderful, not ridiculous
She’s smart
❤ That's cute
Love it😂😍😍😍😍
Genuine question can a dog be autistic?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
HEY LEAST YOU ONKY HAVE PRETEND MY DOG ACTUALLY KNOWS N DOESNT EAT ANYTHING WE ARENT EATING FIRST!!
Lol this is to 😍
So 😍 cute
JUST MEANS YOUR DOG IS DUMB AF LOL 😂
Prison gourmet.
😂😂😂😂
She knows she's special......worth every effort.....  Mutz.... rule....
I had a German Shepherd and she had me trained too. It’s called love♥️
I warm up a little chicken broth, white rice and canned sweet potato purée and add that to my shepherds dry food.  Happy as can be.  Plus, how would you like to eat dry cereal everyday of your like?
‘Sponsored by @Grazza’ 🙃
😂😂😂
It is amazing how they look for attention! My two cats is very similar, would not touch food unless some fresh added.. even I just make a noise by swirling old one as sounds like fresh falling in the bowl :-)
She's not ridiculous she likes seeing you making he something. Plus she's so adorable
WHO IS THE BOSS?
Your poor dog wants fresh food.
She is a beautiful dog. She is waiting so patiently for the imaginary ingredients to cute.
😂😂😂
That is the cutest thing, hilarious too🥰
This is what you've was doing from the beginning. That's why she's acting that way .
You gots to make it special moms. Thanks love you to
😅😅😅
Lol my beagle likes his food on his paw patrol plate he wint eat none until u give him a, sample first
Now, it's made with LOVE!   🥰💗💗💗 the secret ingredient!
❤
She prefers homemade. Wise dog.
While our dog watched happily My father actually put in the dry then got the meat put it in stirred it up good and served our white malamute with love.
She’s just back there watching you add all the imaginary mix ins 🤣
You're sexy🔥 🔥 🔥 😍😍😍not the 🐕
I think she’s even smarter than you think she in fact knows there nothing in there she just likes seeing you walk around looking stupid. She thinks she could lose a little bit of calories
Food goes in bowl. Food stays in bowl. Dog don't eat and it's not for some health related problem? Food still stays in the bowl. Dog will eventually eat the ready and waiting food when the hunger becomes actual hunger.
Damn momma you're fing smoking
Restaurant workers at fast casual restaurants be like:
Dogs are so human! (You can get humans to believe anything, too.)
My Dads German Shepherd is the same way except his food is prepared with a scoop of dry 1 can of soft and and 1 1/2 cups of water all mixed together or he won’t eat it 🤦🏾‍♂️
Lol lol lol
😅
Why are you half naked?
They are so funny
My dog is the same lol
❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
You started it. At this point, it's just routine for him
She's been here before she only want the best
My dog wouldn't eat dog food unless I pretended to eat it and spoon ded it to her
You are cute
Drama dog
You trained the dog to do that. So the dog does that.
This mad me laugh so hard
😂😂😂
I can’t wait to try that for my dog, who usually requires an appetizer before she will eat the kibble
Rotfl
Liar. Real original.
She is cute
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Men of culture, we meet again
This is so funny because I know she sees you haven't put anything different in it. Our dog drinks water and want us to exclaim excitedly that he drunk his water. They are so funny.
That is too cute and funny all at the same time!!!!? 😂 It's all in the head! That's what I have been told! 😉
Why don’t sit near to the dinner table, so that way she feels comfortable as well
For me, it's not enough food,my German eats more than that
❤ Love this Doggie 🐶❤️
Great rack
There is no special ingrediënt. But in this case it's love.
Thems great dogs id love to have one
Sounds like my dog.  Is it a female dog thing. My    dog is so picky and wants cold water out of the refrigerator. If the water sits and gets warm she doesn't want it. Lets me know she wants fresh water out of the refrigerator. They have personalities.
And every night, the dog is disappointed in how bland the food taste
I’d leave it. She gets hungry she’ll eat it.  Not being mean.
She's actually waiting for you to not feed her garbage kibble (never see any animal eating kibble in the wild do you?). Lifespan and Healthspan improves exponentially w homemade food.  Stop shortening your dog's life w that horrible toxic kibble
Everyone gets this treatment, so will she 😂😂
Cathy, i thought of you...mommy does fake stuff to get doggie to eat...thought of you❤
Oh my. She has you trained up😅😅😅😅😅
The dog is black,she wanted seasoning on her food 😂😂
Dogs want to be treated just like everyone else in the family ❤😂
poor dog, having to put up with that nasty condescending attitude
Omg 😂 my German is the EXACT same way 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Does she have to drink her water out of that red cup too?😂
👀🙄🥰♥️♥️💕
Dog jus wants the same treatment around dinner time
He looking like. "Yeah put a lil extra on there"
Holy shit,i thought i was the only one that had to do that for my dog 😂😂
She wants some real food instead of that dethkibble.
Conditioning
So beautiful
😍🤣
I love this. Gourmet only my dear mine did same thing for garlic powder 🥰🤣🤣
Presentation is important. Any cook knows that.
Gonna this with my GSD. Recently she has stopped wanting to eat her bowl of dry food.
My dog will only drink from a cup and I have to hold it
I think that she is wonderful and so are you for loving her this much to do this for her. GOD bless you both this puts a smile on my face. 😊
That is hysterical!!
She’s a QUEEN ❤️❤️❤️
No mom I want you to prepare my food just like yours lol what a character lol
She wants to feel special. That you put time into feeding her. She is not ridiculous.
this is so cool...lol
Probably wating on you to fill up that empty water bowl. Lol
Poor dog needs better food. Thought it was going to be better and special this time and nope same depressing mini food rocks
That's hilarious.   Love it.
🥰 I love it. Animals are special 😊
That’s like my Lola she has to have her treats sprinkled on top or within
We know who is the boss
u should just make her something real instead of just messing with her
A Quantum Jumping dog! How many K9s are doing this now? Creative… genius
No es ridículo es inteligente el observar ❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂❤
It will eat when it gets hungry enough
Mean 😢
My dog doesnt like the food when its been a while already served. I must shake the bowl to turn over the food so she can eat it. I think its because the food gets an odd flavor when its exposed to the air for a long time, just like cereal or bread... Maybe thats the reason your dog does it
Legends need legendary food 😤 😂
Yes mammm!!! Sooo cute. Alsooooooo hell to the NO!!! Dogs communicate totally diff than we do. Not a cool move. But cute.
Lovely❤️
Mine does the same thing
😂
My dogs wet food has to be microwaved and then I have to pretend to put salt and pepper into it 😆
😂😂😂😂😂
What did you put in there after the edit🤔?
😂😂😂😂😂
🥰
OK I feel bad I was love the love for doggo but then watched video few times because her Boob's also is ridiculous.
If you do something more than once, they are convinced it has be done a certain way, or it's  NOT RIGHT...LOL
Excellent Dog psychology!❤😅🐕🐕🐕🐕
The dog is BEGGING for new food clearly he tired of that same old dry food
My cat is the same way
😂😂😂👍👍 reverse psychology the dog has the lady trained 😂
😂😂😂 love it! 😂😂😂
Someone taught her that to begin with 😂
Amazing!
She isn't ridiculous! You eat some dried up, cardboard tasting dog "food" for your entire existence, and let's see how you like it. Give her some REAL food you'd eat yourself. She is part of your family, too. Treat her as such.
I gotta do the same thing for my dog 😅😂
I have to cook my cats food the same way just about
The dog has u over a barrell .. lol
😂😂😂
😂😂😂 my dog do the same thing
Lol my German Shepherd does the same thing she's so picky.
That's hilarious! Just like fooling a little child.😂
Dogs gotta hot momma 🔥🤘
I think I caught a little side eye from her at the end there.
Lmaoooo
Usually when a dog won’t eat their food they know it’s not good for them.  That is why i feed fresh when i can.😊
First I seen a dog demand prana
Mine has started this
I had a dog i had to do this to her food. The things we do for our babies
I’ve always had dogs and this is why I never mix dog food and put it in their original bowl. It’s very hard to get them to eat after doing it
well, now it's special, duh!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A very discerning furball
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The dog says she needs that gourmet stuff and shes just showing you whos boss Human- "im in charge!"  Dog-( * puts paw on humans' shoulder) "Do you feel in charge?"😂
I love it!! lol……..
Omfg that's adorable! Cherish those little idiosycrasies while you can.
Cook my meal mama
That is hilarious
Bless her heart she kows wjat she wants.
My mom cats do the same thing idk why lol
😂
It's the way she's standing there watching for me.. making sure her food is prepared fresh! 😂
😂 my dog does the same thing 😂
She is so pretty!
The dog is just defending the husband
My cat won’t eat unless I touch the food before
She is so cute! Its called wishfull hoping! Hoping that maybe one day you will give her, I dont no, table scraps perhaps? Dont be such a "B" and give her a treat ovcasionally.  I bet she isnt your dog, shes probably your significant others!
KIBBLES ARE CRAPPY
I'm curious to know what you Really gave to the dog to make it remember that special meal to where it won't eat until it tastes that again?
Wtf you expect mom I'm spoiled 😒 and who was the author of that huh 😁😁
And where did she learn these behaviors???  Ey?
Dog: “Its a matter of perspective madam 🧐”
😅😅
I love dogs.  ❤
The lil  booger wants special treatment😂😂😂
The secret ingredient is love.  He wanted you to add love to it.
Painful to watch not only you are feeding your beloved dog horrible dry kibbles. But you are also tormenting her. Shameful.
What you don't realize is that you're actually being recorded by your dog to show how well he has you trained.
The dog is telling you she really trusts you.   ....but it is funny....
Personality that you will miss when gone    I have to pick up my cats and place them  in front of bowls to eat  instead of placing bowl in front of them  then one has to dance with front paws before drinking water
I wouldnt let her treat ylu like that id just leave her to starve. Its not cruel bevause you did feed her
🤣🤣
Talking bout a placebo
I have to micro either frozen broccoli tops or sweet potatoes.  Blend them into mush and add it to their kibble.  No the cats are into this.  Well, its healthy.
My spaniel is similar.
Lmao. 🤣🤣♥️
Yep  some dogs have real strong memories !😂
I love german shepards. My two dogs are 8 years old and 13 years. I am from germany.
❤😂.. SHE JUST WANTS A HOME COOKED MEAL...MADE WITH LOVE 💕 JUST LIKE U FIX 4 ER'BODY ELSE.. 😮😅😊OK.. FYI.. TBH...SMH... WYM... SHE WANTS THAT EXTRA LOVE 💕 AND ATTENTION PUT INTO HER MEAL AS WELL DEAR 😜💋.. IZZAT 2 MUCH 2 ASK 4 HONEY??
🤣🤣🤣
That is so funny.
At least give her a little bit meat with the kibble sshhheeessshhh
I do this to my dog too never fails 😅
The best part.. that dog ABSOLUTELY knows that it's the same ingredients. The dig isnt being tricked, they have too good of smelling for that. That dog just enjoys the ritual of it all and thats amazing 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯
It's cute.  Thanks for sharing!
To funny
Nice set
I do the same exact procedure for 2 felines and one huge pup. It works everytime!!  It's the actors voice , me and clanking of silverware..Hah😅
Adorable!
wonder how this all started lol
It's all that love that you put in it.
Maybe give her something else besides just dry food. I don’t think we have people just want dry food either.. in nature, animals find different foods to. But that’s just me with an opinion.
That’s funny. The dog thinks that you put special stuff in it when all you did was trick or pretend that’s hilarious. I love it.
❤ she wants her special girl food too
Oh, the art of illusion, and the trick of the hand, how marvelous! 🎉😂🎉😊🎉😂🎉
😂😊😂😊😂😊 mine is up at 6am every morning ❤
Hahaha mine are the same, so  I move the spoon in their bowl, those sounds get them all excited about what’s coming
Love it wants the real love food not that bag food awesome dog you got
I had a Standard Poodle who required me to make a soft boiled egg to add to his breakfast, and then I rubbed Bailey’s back while he ate. While he was staying with my parents my mother said “I am not making him and egg and rubbing his back whike he eats!” Three days later I called to check in and my stepfather said “hold on for your mom, she’s making Bailey’s egg so she can go rub his back!” Cheers, Michael Albuquerque NM USA
She needs water
My dog doesn’t want anything ever he might eat, but barely enough to keep him alive. However, he insist that he sees me wash and fill his water bowl at least five times a day. He hast to see me do it or he dumps the bowls or drags them across the room.
For some reason, I don’t think my dogs would fall for that. They live by their noses.
So friggin cute
" WE  " SPOIL THEM .
Ha
She likes a home-cooked meal like my dogs 🤣🤣give her liver and gizzards
You added the love...
❤❤❤❤❤
The dog is actually a Carnivore that's yearning for some MEAT! The canine teeth are for eating meat and NOT corn or wheat. You've probably got the dog on the wrong diet, so add some of your food to it. For the dogs sake and to extend its life.
Add the spices.😂😂😂
Acts like my pittie...
I didn’t see a dog. Only two puppies.
Cute
Aww she thinks she’s people! Good pup!❤
Nicht der Hund ist hier der Dumme!🙈
Such a beautiful dog!♥
Id want you to do that to mine too, as I watch.
she just want it prepared with love 😂
Why not ? We spend hours preping our meals , he s demanding very little
Too Cute! Nothing she think your giving something it's all on the head❤😂
Send this to Rockstar asap. lol i can't wait
Get her a play kitchen.
She wants some love put in that food
Wow I would be in trouble.  I have 5 pitties that are seriously food motivated😂
Lol. It's like Hollywood. Your dog loves your Chef actor skills. 😂
The food has chemicals and the dog is asking her to fix it😢
She's Beautiful.
😁
I am going to do this to my dog!!! 😂😂😂
So cute
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
My dog will purposefully drop his ball in his food bowl and bark at me. I pull it out and mix the food around with my hand, then he eats.  Same exact food he has been eating forever.
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣💜💜💜💜
Mine just wont eat till i put his vitamins (capsule of flax seed oil and omega 3)
Just because they can eat it don’t mean it’s food. How about you eat fast food and frozen food forever? 😂 should mix up with little good dog food
Your fooling your dog. But it innocently believe in you.
I have a rotten spoiled pug who I love to pieces, but he is the boss of this household😂 and I have to do the same exact magic to his food before he will eat it. It’s hilarious. Are you sure we are not their pets?😂😂😂😂
Occasionally I hope she gets a treat!
So desperate for something else
So, what you're saying is: "I can afford a GSD, I can afford stone countertops, I can afford a big house, but I can't be bothered to feed my animal anything better than $8/bag Kibbles & Bits."  This was a self-own, and you don't even realize it.
I loved this clip. Dog is playing you 😂😂
How about real food? Like chiken?
❤raw food please  Dry food gets boring  Your a good dog mom 👍🏻
Maybe you should mix some meat with the biscuits. Looks very dry..
my dog wont eat until i tell him that i would give his food to the other dog or the neighbor's cat
I think not sure but the upside down solo cup might be the key to the whole thing?  Just like when the bank asks you what your mother’s maiden name is. What’s that about?
😂😂😂😂❤
Wow, better you than me
Oh know my dog does that too, I never thought to fake it! I’m going to try that
Love it❤😅😅
Spoiled
❤🤣
The shake part. My favorite
I have a cat like this smh they are so spoiled.. yes it’s my fault
My male doberman does the same thing. 🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GSD uses to get humans well trained.
And now some water
Love that dog🤩
Lol,  the dog is like, "awh yeah, that's the stuff."
Mine does the same thing! But sometimes he still doesn’t want it!! 😱😬
The things we do for our fur babies!
Your dog is your best friend for part of your life,  but you are your dogs best friend for all of their lives!!!❤❤❤
LOL, my dogs do the same thing!!
😂😂😂❤
She's waiting for mom to add the "magic".
She wants you to put some love into her serving aswell :)
Maybe waiting for potential can food?
😂😂😂❤
I’ll bet your Mac n Cheese is amazing.  👍
😂😂😂😂😂
She learned the behavior
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love love love this!!❤
You should never lie to your dog I don't think it's healthy
Hahahaaaaa🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hahaha... she's pretty funny
How cute
Done that for my dogs.  So funny 😂
Mine has to have the first bite, served to him in my hand!!!!! Then he will eat out of his dish😅
She wants some real food 😫
Hahaha awesome
And I thought Greman Shepards were smart😂
So sweet!
😂😂😂😂😂my dog
😂
Haha that doesn't work with my shepherd
I'm sorry I got distracted....
How do I donate a steak to that baby love dog videos keep going good work love your dog❤❤❤
OMG that is so damn cute
That is how my dog wants her food 😂
Glad i'm not the only one having to trick my best pal almost the same way to eat by adding three very small pieces of white bread on top of his home cooked meals . NO dry kibble at all. Only home cooked chop beef , broccoli, carrots , cauliflower,  celery all chopped up very fine twice a day. Do you think I absolutely love my Husky best pal.
She sees you preparing your food & wants the same treatment!
My chihuahua wont eat his dog food out of the bowl, I have to put it on my stool and then he will eat it. I think he thinks they're. snacks. HEY whatever works works
Ur dog is like a lot of people
Do it with love ❤
She knows the kibbles are killing her.. I cook real food for mine whether I eat or not.
Know what's funny, if you just leave the food in the bowl without doing that, they will eat it before they starve. Just walk away, you're being neurotic and over "parenting" just let them do them
You doing the small little thing makes her happy. 3 minutes of your day is nothing.
God damn, you fine as hell lady. you can store half a library of books on that rack
She spoils her pet then calls it ridiculous when it responds to the stimili that it's used to receiving.
Hilarious 😂
that's how my dog is lol
I do have a same “stupid dog” as you do and have to talk to her at the same time saying: look how i am cooking for you !!!! 🎉😂
😂😂❤❤❤❤ he wants it prepared like for the rest of the family. Because he is part of the family ❤❤❤❤
She’s telling you she wants real food not over cooked brown rocks
Pavlov would be proud 😂
Could be that she gets some cheap Pedigree branded dog food, that the dog isn't feeling. Probably wouldn't hurt mixing some chicken or something into it anyways but. I use to know this chick that would always only feed her 2 pitbulls chicken breasts and rice, cooked and mixed in a bowl lol. At the cost of dog food, probably didn't cost much more. Just more time in cooking and preparing it, although now a days I'm not sure if the price of dog food has gone up as much as human food has.
😂😂😂
Momma is stacked !
How cruel
such a sweetheart! 🥺 baby deserves meat and little bits of veggies!
I adore German Shepherd sense of humor ❤
Poh's father once said, "the secret ingredient for special noodle is...NOTHING!"
I GOT TO TELL MY FRIEND ABOUT THAT AND TRY IT MYSELF TOO
Wow, like a little kid! These beautiful creatures are getting smarter by the day
Dogs are just wonderful
The ta ta's are pretty nice too!
give real food, meat etc. kibbles aren't real food
I’m Peeing in my pants lol
My Cat is the Same Way  lol
Thats so funny! I have to do the same thing
Our doberman would not eat unless our family was eating at the dinner table. I could fill her boul in the morning and she would wait until she saw us eating.
THAT WOULD BE ONE HUNGY DOG.
😂😂😂❤❤❤love GSDs! So adorable!
She wants some of that gourmet sh*t
Tell me about it! I have to act like Im eating it too. 🤔❤
My dog 🐶 looks just like that
Mine do the same thing 🙂
Pretty sure at one point she had leftovers
😅😅😅❤❤
She’s Adorable. Mama complaints but look what she does for her baby, I LOVE IT CUS IM THE SAME WAY WITH MY BABY CHLOE
And ever Amen!!! I love this gorgeous dog innocence! To the human: thank you for playing her/his game!!! Really thank you!!!
my dog, he'll turn the stove on for ya...u gonna cook 4real
That's funny
She got you trained just the way she likes it
lol
😂 it’s my fault
i wanted to see your buns baee😩forget the dawg you gorgeous human 😍
Not spoiled at all😂
The dog is smart she knows it's not natural food... But in the end she got no options that's why she eats.
😂
Add real food
Mine does the same thing😅 What a beauty
Lmao. She's tooooo cute 🥰❤❤❤
hahahahaha
She'll eat...you're just an idiot
Wow
😍😍😂😂 love this . Someone is very well trained 🤣
Mom he wants you to bake for him, because that food is bad for him😮
She soooo posh 😁❤️💪🏻🤟🏻
😂😂😂😂😂
She wanted food made with love
Too funny, lol
Hilarious ❗️That Dog Has Spent Too Much Time In The Kitchen. 👀😂😅😂😅❤
Raised bowls are bad for shepards and other deep-chested dogs. These types of dogs are prone to bloat, and having raised food and water dishes will increase that risk
She's trying to tell you she is sick of Kibble and when she realizes you think you tricked her she guves up...and then next meal she teies again..and again...and again in hopes you will eventuality feed her something else. Kibble kills pets. Make her food. Chicken meant organs(except liver) peas and carrots. Add ceushe raw pumpkun seeds and a touch of sea salt food gradre diatomaceous earth.
Thats hilarious ♡
❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤so cute ❤😂❤
😂
She looks just like my dog gorgeous!!! He is resting in Heaven
That's Right I need my food cooked😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
It must be a shepherd thing mine love when I pretend I'm adding things also😂😂😂
You’ve got it easy! I can’t get away with that with my dog. My dog would take one sniff of the food and then scoff at it and me before getting real vocal as she gives me the “I may be a dog, but I know what real food smells like!” look - My dog will ONLY eat fresh cooked food. I even tried to starve her out of the behavior by only offering kibble for three whole days, she responded by going on a hunger strike and just scoffing at me and growling at me! She’s the definition of high maintenance 😂
😂😂😂My dog are ridiculous too . I feel them chicken with their kibble. I'm going to try your method to see if it works. 😂😂😂
We used to have a dog who wanted garlic powder on ĥis food
And you love her so much you feed her processed food for every meal. Boy such a good mom😮
You don't pour it in you prepare it ❤ Gourmet 💯
She is so cute how she watches every step😂 of
She wants all the stuff you put in your food.
Lol
Cutest thing ever....you such a goodd Mommy
😅😊😂
😂😂😂My GSD is literally the same way. 🤯
Dogs are soo soo smart. This warms my heart!!!
So funny you are very well trained mom ❤
Spoiled absolutely rotten
honestly dogs don’t live that long , imagine having to eat that shitty food they make for dogs your whole life
😂😂😂
😂❤
If it's good enough for thee, it's good enough for me. That looked like some top shelf seasoning.
You're so cute
I mean, to be fair...you made it look so real that it would have fooled me as well 🤷‍♂️
❤😂❤❤😂😂
Aww❤
You should have put it in the microwave for 10 seconds (Never turning it on) but that will definitely make it taste even better😂
My dog is a garbage disposal entering the room anytime she hear anything she thinks is food wrapper or food related for her consumption
My dogs do the same thing 😂😂 they smarter then we think they are!!
Poor dog, he deserves a healthy and delicious food other than that unhealthy food that you serve everyday!
Dogs are smarter than you think!!
She gets fooled that she got a gourmet meal instead of plain dry food. Mine actually gets the gourmet. 😊
So hilarious and so cute 😆
Imagination is everything.. 😂
Dog with class. 😂
It's not good until mama makes it.
I always do that with my dog, except I really put in the special ingredients.    Good stuff!
i have the same dog, and mine wont except a chessy snack from me unless i eat 1 1st while she watches, we have gone though this since we got her. lol
Ever heard of the expression 'pampered pooch'? this dog is the definition of that. Bless her lol.
He needs something.....special
I'm a barbie 💕 dog, I need a special meal.., cuz I'm so special,  let's go dogie,  let's go dogie 🎶💕🐕🥘🍲😂🤣👌💯
My dog is the same way except you have to pretend to eat some Of it.  Your not eating it she isn’t either.
How cute♥️I love dogs!
My dog gets spoilt by my other half like puts ham in his food etc. When he acts picky and doesnt eat it, i know he wants ham in it but all i do is say "look here, go get it" and i bend down and pretend I've put something in his food. He eats it all up lol he doesnt do it often but when he does that's what i do. My other half actually puts ham in it lol
Faking out puppy...
She watch how you prepare meals for your family and wants the same treatment
Hmmmm wonder where the dog learned this from duh
Dog: "Food straight out of a bag ??...how uncivilized"
Love this.
That dog ain't a fool : he wants its meal with that touch of love !
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Poor baby 😢. I would add some olive oil to my German shepherd 's meal.
I have to put YouTube on and play vids of dogs eating to get mine to eat. And I have to hand-feed her.
🤣🤣🤣thanks for posting
This dog mom had me rolling at four am watching her. This dog is so high maintenance and I am here for it lol
Love your dog. She's adorable
Fussy Bloody Dog ! ! ! 😂😂😂😂
Give thar dog a medal she's got you well trained 😆 🤣 😂
😂😂😂
You try eating the same thing every single day and you want to spice it up as well
I wanna know please , why is there a random beer pong red plastic ??
Trust me if you leave that food out she will have no choice but to eat or starve
I’m crying laughing because my dog did the same thing for a long time. I used to put honey in his food when he was sick so eventually he wouldn’t eat unless he had honey in it. Which I had to pretend to do each time until he forgot about it.
😄🍝
My lilbee..well she expects special preparation...lol. every night ..lol..
If you want to make something special, you need to believe it to be special.
My dogs leave the room!! They won’t touch their food until l make it special! And they don’t get hungry until 10:00 PM!( two Staffordshire terrier sisters) weird!!
Too many onions🤣
Bad owner. Dont do that. The dog will eat eventually, its not going to starve itself. It just thinks it can boss you around.
Hilarious...my pup is like this
I think this is a sign for her asking for fresh food as she feels something coming on and science proves how horrible processed kibble is to our fur babies…. Just a thought?
Her watching in the back 😢
She wants love with her meal.
One of my cats won't eat unless I give him a big fuss first, the other had to clean her teeth and be dried beforehand (being wet is not necessary).
She just wanted u to sprinkle it with love first ❤
She's telling you. Stop feeding me so much processed shit. Cut up some eggs and ham.
You take time to cook yours so do as well for hers😅
She was a pampered princess in a previous life!!!  👑
One thing that’s actually good for your dog and would provide a solution is hydrating the dogfood. Makes it easier to eat and it’s better for them.
Cook for her? 😊❤
Lmao! Hysterical!😅
what a cutie
She's got you trained well😅
Put some grated cheese on ….
your boobs so good
raw food stupid
My cats do something similar.  They won't eat their wet food from their bowl until i "prepare" it for them which means mixing, lying out a placemat for each of them and place several treats near their food bowl as well.  They're not stupid that's for sure.
I pet sit. Cats do that too.
Lol he's gonna bite you
The dog was like u know how I like it
She just wanted the extra loving touch!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE HER!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Imagine you having to eat dry processed food all your life while watching others eat prepared delicious smelling food. Imagine that. Dogs are evolving
That is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen 😂😂😂
Yeah thats my cat
My dog would know right away u were tricking him. U can't pull the wool over my Pitts eyes. Sorry sister.
I watched my little brother smoke lettuce and then get high and then have ago at me for telling him it was lettuce because he’s clearly high.   The placebo is a powerful force!.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
That is hilarious
Try feeding your dog anything other than cardboard and they might eat without a gimmick.
Try this. Cook half cup rice with chopped carrots and garlic. Then mix youre kibble with one can friskies tuna n chicken. Mix it good and then put rice in and mix well. When done mixing, pour 1 cup water into mix and then squirter in cbd dose for joint comfort. Cbd should be in olive oil. Sometimes I put onion and xtra olive oil and flaked red pepper. My dog absolutely loves it.  Sometimes I add ranch dressing or sub Ramen flavor pack for the garlic. I use less kibble in the dish when feeding with rice
Thats the magic sauce.
U r the one who does not get it.. the dog want fresh food not like u and u pretend u r preparing fresh food for the dog.. who is crazy and weird here?!?.and u think u r smart and the dog is strange.. think again..u humans R so crazy!
Cause she just bougie like that!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👣🐾
That's wild love it, keep making your pet happy.
Your dog watches you do fancy stuff with your food. She thinks you forgot!!
Maybe actually put some olive oil on that Kibble 😊
Yeah? Who started the whole process? Hmmm
Excellent !!! 😂😍💗
😂 my german shepherd does the same thing!!! I shake it around and its perfect😋
Actually a sign of a smart dog! I have to do that with my dog too and to get them to drink more water, just change the bowl!! Or put some bullion in it but unsalted!!
This is ridiculous. Leave it there.  Dog will eat when it gets hungry.
Reminds me of my Yorkie! Only he better taste the gourmet, or it is no eatimg.
your wrong for that
lol that was adorable. What a smart baby u kave lol so cute
My dog pulls this stunt
SoooooooooSweeeeeeet and wonderful of this fur Mama for her Babyyyyyyyy 💕 ❤️ 💖 😍 💗
Ironically I'm pretty sure it tastes the same
Maybe feed her some decent food.
One of our dogs is the same way but you gave me a couple of new ideas!
My dog is the same too funny
We have to do the same thing here with our Husky!
Cutest ever🎉
That is hilarious. She is special and you’re just her chef. 😂😂😂
The dog tricks herself into eating those brown dry rocks
It's home-made now, lol
Give her water. There was no water in her bowl.
😂😂😂
What a trickster!
😂😂😂😂 Je fais la même chose à mon chat
My dog needs special sauce. It's water😓🤣
Now we have established you are the slave.
She has you trained like a dog 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
My daughters dog wouldn’t drink water unless it had ice in it 😅
that happens with ours sometimes and our cat used to be like that. I put a couple new pieces in & mixed tada!
You did that, not the dog.
She is so beautiful!!
Would been funny if the dog slapped it out yo hand if he noticed😂
Spoilt brat 😂
😂😂😂 that’s that placebo effect
😅😅😮😮8😅😅😮
You’re mean
tlc please & thank you!
Dod it once before tho
I love your dog
What’s up with the red cup?
She waited for you to add the love to the bowl.
My cat Severi, is the same. It IS absolutely ridiculous.
Looks like she has you trained perfect
Pavlovian conditioning.
The dogs also want good, normal FOOD, not that ''ready'' artificial chemicals....
Spoilt brat 😂😂😅😅. Have seen many kids like this, but first dog. Problem is German shepherds are highly intelligent and those kinds are usually over imaginative. People with active imaginations feed on stories, no matter how far fetched. Her mom is very smart. 😅😅😂😂
😂🤣😂 My dog is the same. Won’t touch it without a sprinkle of cheese on top! And the cutting board sound…EVERY time! 😂😂
That’s a shame….😂😂😂😂😂
What have you done? 😂
the dog knows that dry food is bad ...
German Shepherds are the best!
Dogs are such fun. They know how to train humans. 😂😂😂
Gotta love them
Feed better quality food not kibble
My wife does the same thing to my food! It’s the act of her doing something special for me 😂 that makes me accept her lousy food.
She's family ❤️
🤣🤣🤣👍
It test better now😂😂😂
And why don’t you actually add some cut up meat to it ? Imagine eating dry kibble every day!
Amazing
Time to get a new dog,
Why don’t you put something real in that bowl
Omg my dog is the same way 😂
Bahaha my bunny won t start eating if I don t give her the first piece by hand ! We re well trained hoomans !
My Lucky is the same way and I would rather feed  him than anybody else! He's so patient..😊❤
😂
😂😂😂
MY CAT would only drink water if he stood on the toilet and I held his water bowl as he drank.
She has standards.
Too cute!
I have a German shepherd and she is exactly like that
OMG I thought my dog was the only one!!😂😂🐶🐶💕💕💕💕💕💕
(   •   )(   •   )        _____
That Dog 🐶 is gorgeous not ridiculous a made heart ❤️ he just wants to eat with his family
German shepherds are the best
Dogs train us!
Placebo effect😂
😂😂😂
And people ask me why I don't have a dog and don't like this.  This video encapsulates it quite well.
She's wants a special ingredient, love. She's such a cutie, she's not ridiculous. We've all done something similar when we were kids.
Give the good girl her shallots.
That's proof of the placebo effect 😂😂 Don't EVER cook her a fresh meal. She'll never eat dry food again 😅
🤣🤣 too cute
Hilarious
My dog is the very same way...
So cute ❤
I have one that does the same
To funny 😂😂😂
Spoiled rotten ..wouldn't have it any other way !❤
That's the funniest thing I've ever seen! My Shepherd has me well trained, too
What a special dinner! She's no dummy! She has yo very well trained!❤🐕
Mine wont eat without parmesan cheese 😅
You're not very nice to her. 😢
😂😂😂
Yep!! ours too!! We call it "Fick it": ("fixed it" what our daughter use to call it when she was 3).  All of them are bratty and loved so thats what they expect and we oblige!!!😂❤❤❤
Too funny 😂😅😂😅
I mean you went through the trouble might as well have given her a treat
My husbands cat refused to eat if he was not standing next to her
This is adorable.
ppl are saying she deserves this treatment. No she doesn't. She deserves literally nothing, and that's why she could be dinner the next night and the police would never come knocking. You know why THAT is? Because she is not a citizen with government records. You know why THAT is? Because she doesn't have ANY human thoughts, feelings or intentions of ANY sort.    Mind you, I love my dog. He's the best. It's painful beyond imagination to think about him getting old and dying, which is happening now. He's 11. But he's a dog and I would put him down in a heart beat if he bit anyone in my life, even people that I don't like. Because he's a dog. Dog worship in western culture is creepy as ALL hell.
A mimd over matter!😂❤
My husky is about as bad!!!!
LOL I Love that dog!
They’re pack animals you are her leader , she wants the same as you give your family cos she is your family
You’re both lovely.   I have a feeling that she knows that you wouldn’t sheer her wrong, and the missing secret ingredient is the added LOVE.
Be Grateful for this Canine as She/He Loves You-  Guessing  that you probably Dont Deserve the Unconditional Love from an Animal
My cats only drink water or eat when I say you can do it, and pretend I eat or drink from their bowl lol😅
she would eat when she got hungry enough!  :)
It's not the literal ingredients, it's the emotional ingredients, specifically Mama's Love.
Gotcha pretty well-trained, Mommy!!! 🤣
The price goes to the one seeing Dog is a fool
OMG! 😂😂😂 My cat does the same thing
It’s the Love you added that made it Dinner
That reminds me of Lo lmao 😂😂
Cesar would say YOU NEED TRAINING. YOU'RE WACKO
😅😅😅😅
If you dont treat her like a dog then guess what? She'll treat you like a dog! Gotta luv her though! 😅
I have to pretend to eat my dogs food before she eats it😂Mental how they can be😂
kibble is high carb leading to diabetes. wet food is better.
My colleague has to mix dog's food loudly with the spoon  in bowl on stovetop and pretend to cook it.
Amazing but not surprised!! & 🙌🏼, I love, your love & caring for her, that comes with it; all behind the simple effort n bit of time you make, to keep her happy & her feeling loved by you❣️ By all you’re doing for her..🤩👌🏼🫠
Hahaha! This is epic! Dogs are the weirdest and the best! ❤
Hilarious!
lmao
That's hillarious
Hahahaha funny god best friend
😅 Oh my goodness 🤣
When u see the cut in filming she changed bowl to real food.  Easy to spot . Trick of an eye
Couldn't fool an Australian  Shepherd  by doing that, only a GSD
No the dog is smart he needs something besides dry dog food.
OMG my cat's the same!!
She's smart and patient.❤
Lmao, i sometimes add things to my labs food, and now I have to do this same thing to get her to eat on days, when I have nothing to add, just to make her think it’s a special meal. I thought just my dog was spoiled like this.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Love it! Lol😂
Dura lex sed lex
Like my cat which always demands of hand feeding every bite
She needs water
All dogs deserve better than just dry, processed dog food everyday. Fresh meals sometimes are a must
Omg the back pain ❤
My dog eats vegetables with her dinner!
Rename your dog  "Placebo"
You train your dog to do this nonsense. If he gets hungry enough, he'll eat.
i think the dog wants the food to be prepared by the master :)
❤ He's precious...you made my Monday a smiling day. Can't stop laughing. You're great doggy mommy to figure out that doing all that would get him to eat. 👍👍
I want my meals prepared.  Smarter then most humans.
I have one like this too!😂
Chicken tenders and boil it Text in Spanish. And some brown rice. Put it all in a pot and boil it. Add a Campbell's to it. Now you got dog food. The latest shoe fall most weeks.
Dog: I saw those other dog vids....they're servants do this to their food😅😅😅😅
❤❤❤❤❤😅
So you can’t see the dog is asking for meat not just dry biscuits? And you think tricking it is a good thing? Poor dog, give it some decent food, learn to understand it and be a better owner
Cutest thing ever!!!!!!
Love is the secret ingredient
No es justo jjjj❤
She's just needs you to put your special touch on the food.
She looks exactly like my Billy, the best girl I miss so much.
My dog
Brilliant!! Everybody likes to feel special.
CTHU My dog does that..he lers me know  I want what you got 🤣🤣🤣 All the flavors... smh
Hahaha, this is too funny!
Hilarious
She says, "I'm family just like them. Hook me up, Mom. Please."
What a goofy dog.  But still, ya gotta love her! 🥰
...and she DESERVES every bit of your effort!
Gonna try that with my pup who won't eat...
IT'S ALL IN THE PRESENTATION😊😅 MY DOG LIKES TO WATCH ME MAKE HER FOOD TOO❤
I'm done😂😂😂
Hahaha
I need to try this!
Hey I just want to give you some information dogs are Danny gravy they needed a different flavors and stuff dog food not the same old same old you just get some soft food combine it with the cards it's called the you know when you eat food you eat different like chicken hamburgers and spaghetti you have different varieties dogs want to see you eat bread they can smell the stuff when you're eating hamburgers and spaghetti and stuff I give my dog I put the hard with the spaghetti in it and tomato sauce if I make me a hamburger I make my dog a hamburger with cheese and just cut it up with no no other stuff in it and chop it up for the dog has a snack your dog need a snack variety flavors and you can give your dog human food not too much but just very little not to get to company buy it but combine it with dry or soft I got my pedicure the chicken gravy packets they're about 80 cents eachconnect with a dry dog food to buy about 24 a month and then mix it with the dog food so that we have flavor dog likes variety just like you do you have to think like your mind you know the dogs that wants what you want but anyway just thought I'd let you know if you happy lots of snacks lots of kisses and rub their ears they like lots of attention and that kisses and the next steps I've got my daughter cocker spaniel about four or five jars of snacks they're pretty cheap at Walmart😂😂😂😂😂 but love you baby😂
Instead of going through the motions why dont you actually do something to it. Dry food is a killer.
They want you to give them an order to eat. Maybe thats how they thought this is the order to eat.
Feed the dog real food not garbage kibble
Thats actually horrible food for dogs.  Dogs need meat.  They are carnivores.
😂😂😂❤❤❤
So funny 😂
My dog would only eat if I am eating at the same time and I cherished him for that.
Well, both being are stupid.
suggestion: Cook batch Ground turkey for the week add it to the bowl. My dogs love it😘
That is not food, is poison.
I’m dying 😂 look at her watching
in my house, that's called "mommy put magic sprinkles"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂
stop feeding animals this no nutrion processed crap!! this is why animals dont live to be 18-20 yrs old anymore like they use to back in the day b4 the pet food industry started mass production of their crap!! Feed your dog home cooked food or give him your leftovers.. thats what dogs ate b4 they started making this processed crap. no living being should ever eat processed food for every meal of their life..
😂ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!❤
Yeah if I had that for dinner I’d want some fucking love to go into too
Dog: good girl
i have 2 german sheperds and the male wont even eat until the female is done eating
💖🤣💖😍💖🥰💖😘💖
ordinary dog food with some magic sound effect 😁
Foodl ways tastes better when someone else makes it
Just put a little water in
My cat wants certain service. It’s a trip
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Gordon Ramsay was a dog
They deserve All the extra care and Attention because of the Love and Loyalty they give us..🥹🥹🥹😢😢😢😢
This is how I feed my fur babies I actually do cook for them chicken and Beef plus veggies 😊
So so adorable 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Thanks for this! I tried it on my dog as he is a real fussy eater and as soon as I did your trick it worked a treat! 😂😂😂
NO DOG  IS SMART - Its about the Energy you put into the meal not the food - DOg demands love ! Smarter tha n the Human
How sweet ❤❤❤
No to tik tok
😂😂😂
Dog: "I didn't come for the food. I came for the service"
HOW CUTE!
Aww spoiled baby ❤
I always find it amazing how dogs train their human more than the human can train their dog.
Oh how I miss my Rusty, thanks for posting this. It brings back warm, happy memories as well as sadness that he's no longer with me ..😢😥
Too funny!
I think she just wants to think it's homemade and you do a very good job and I'm doing it
Awe give her a special sometime. Idk if you do already. But she definitely deserves special meals and treats. She’s gorgeous.
The dog sees you do this before you eat and thinks it's required.
Smart and Beautiful
😂
Mine are the same, except they won't accept the fake out....lol😅😅😅
We had a Norwegian Elk Hound/wolf that was smart enough that she would smell it to make sure it was "done" figured out that garlic was the secret ingredient. She would not eat anything (except roadkill, another story lol) unless it had garlic on it. Smh lol Ellie was the smartest, gentlest, fearless doggo ever. Still miss her and its been 30 yrs. Some animals you just never forget.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Love
Hot T&A.  Perfect for shorts
My dog is the same lol
Give her real food
LOL. I have a dog that is similar. She will not eat until she sniffs my nose and I am watching her eat. If I am not watching, she stops eating.
Love animals BUT pup pup would starve waiting for me to figure it out 😭
No wonder you're feeding your dog poisonous dry dog food. Poor dog ! Here comes Cancer , and many other health problems. Dogs aren't supposed to have dry dog food. Veterinarians aren't trained on nutrition!
Cute :)
Man give her an egg and chicken broth in there ..
So true my small dog has me train too😂
Mine does the same thing. Spoiled.
Stop feeding them this garbage, it’s literal poison. Will get them sick with cancer, you can actually cook for them with meat and few veggies and supplement it with doggy vitamins 😊😊
Funny
my 13 1/2 year old german shephered is like this too
Honestly its the least we can do. We feed them pebbles every damn day
You added love to his meal.
What's up with the red cup
Some dogs can have sophisticated tastes. Maybe he wants shavings of white truffles in his dog food. A king needs a King's meal! Forwith, now.. peasant! 😄😄
My dog is the same way
My cat does this too!
ADORABLE!!! I love it!!!🥰
Sane as the men in your life 😂
If only my husband would buy the same skit. 😅
😮😅haha what!!!! I havee to try this with my dog!
Might as well get her, the farmer dog food😂
I. Love. This.  Dog!
You did it... wonder  what the kids are like if she has any. A karen in the woks😢😂😂😂
She has you trained well!
The dog want different kind of food some times.
You've trained her to do this the moment she wasn't interested in eating one day so you created a ritual that you'll always need to do in order for her to eat! Owners are always the problem....never the dog! Sorry but it's true!
LMAO 😂, my dog is the same way
Mom u forget special sauce and chopped topping cmon
🤣🤣🤣
that is hilarious
She wants her food the way your food is prepared. Thats a smart dog. ❤
That makes me sad. Do the extra stuff for her. I make slow cooker food and warm it up to put on top of my dogs's food. Don't lie to her.
It’s about first class service sweetheart 😂😂😂lol
Poor little baby! She’s spoiled ROTTEN!!!🤣🤣🤣
This dog is “ridiculous”? How? Surely you’re not under the delusion of believing she doesn’t know exactly what is and what is not happening here. I assure you, Madam, she knows.
😂💕that’s all i gotta say
Mine is the same way 😁😁😁😁
😆 hilarious
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dog need some flavor not that bland shit. This dog is a brother
She say until you put some love into it I won’t eat it. Lmao
❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Poor thing, dog eats rocks, because that's what kibble is...
Oh my God I am laughing so hard my dogs are spoiled little brats 😂😂😂
I've lost a German Shepherd, his name was Hans and I miss him very much. Love your puppy and don't make fun of his/her need for your love.S/he is not ridiculous, S/he is in love with you and your love for her.
got to be a  rescue
Feed raw problem solved lol
It's training you.😅
Aww Cook that baby some real food! She deserves it! ❤
Just add some bone Broth and some extra veggies, chicken livers for the poor dog. Try eating dry food all the time.
Fake. The dog wants to eat but you haven't given him permission to. You can see his eagerness at the bowl. thumbs down. You aren't fooling anyone
Dog looking at the camera with a smirk: Now they get to see how well I trained you.
The dog is saying you fix your food up now fix my food up. The lease you could do for my services of protection. Lol
Was that honey?
My freaking cat is the same way lol 😂
LOL 😂MY CAT LOL
Too funny
My dog did the same exact thing, only I couldn't fake it.. I actually had to put something on it then we ate
Aww feed him something good. Is all you feed him kibble?
My cat is the same damn way.
I love how the dog licks her chops when the soy sauce is added in 😂😂😅
""Lil Mama you know i need some sriracha on that thang! A lil oregano too while you at it!!!""
😂😂😂 if I give my dogs water it better have 🧊 in it.. if I give them food it better come from the stove and have cheese in it.. so yea I'm their chef and their Uber driver😂😂😂
Lol
This is hilarious I love that dog👍🦴😋
Sign that dog up for The Farmers Dog!
Lmbo 😂
Dogs is crazy. Like my cat. Have to put her food in the perfect spot- or no eating. If you put the bowl in front of her- no eating. We love our animals. And like this one- they love us back.
Awe, doggy deserves some real food love.
😂😂😂❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😅.. and she’s not playing
She has high standards. I support that. 👑
No dog should have to eat nasty dry kibble!  Instead of pretending to feed your best friend real Healthy food, just do it!
My dogs r the same 😂😂😂
What if they know you're not doing anything to it but want you to at least put more of an effort than opening a sack
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
food tastes better with the secret ingredient of love
😂🤣😂
❤she just wants to feel special!!!❤
She’s watching her 😂
LOL I had to do that with my Shepard too!
My GS too!
Hysterical! I love it!
You followed the assignment
Our dog will not eat canned dog food UNLESS it is warmed up in skillet.
Nah she just needed the word to eat when she said eat she went but she cut it straight after and took the bowl then and did the rest of the vid. Fake no cool don't try to make it look like that.
🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious!😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂
😂🤣😂🤣
😂😂😂😂😂 I needed this laugh!🤣 You’ve got to love a GSD.
just like any dog, any moment of the week. Don't you just love it? 💖💖💖
Dinner for the King!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Lol, My cat does this same thing.
😅😅😅
Mine does that too! The gourmet treatment is always employed 😅
She's really waiting for good food and settling for a show.
My little 4 1/2 pound dog would have sniffed and walked away probably barked at me loudly. Lola would not have accepted the food. Yes Lola is spoiled 😅
I love it
Where is her water
😂😂
She studied what she does in the kitchen and knows you eat after making noise in the kitchen.
Poor baby 😢 I spoil my Cali Girl Home cooked every day
She just wants that extra Mom love mixed in!!😊❤❤
She loves your cooking
Wow.....😂😂😂😂
he just wants fresh food😂😂
My dog is the same way
That's the only way I eat dog food too!
I have to do this also for my dog😂
Absolutely REMARKABLE!!!!!
Thanks momma!
I had a dog that wouldn't eat until I stirred his food up with my finger.
You can tell she IS spoiled… But that’s what makes a dog’s love so special…
"Wtf is this Karen? You did all the same things you do when you make people food and it still tastes like dry kibble?"
My dog won't drink his water after our walk until he sees me drinking my water! Go figure 😂
How funny
This dog is ridiculously 😂😂😂
my cat does the same thing XD
My cat does something similar! 😂
😅😂
Why beautiful dog can not have great real/warm cooked meal instead of ball of dog biscuits ?
That doesn't look like food.
I wouldn't feed my gsd rubbish like that! Fresh meat bones and veg.
LOL... that's hilarious
That dog has the woman under her thumb! 😅
I think she is trying to get a diet with more imagination than just kibble
My cat does the same thing.
Got YOU TRAINED
My one-year-old Doxy won’t eat his food unless I pretend like I’m licking the spoon and enjoying it
She needs water too!
My dog doesn't eat untill you give her a kiss on the head. We used to just say yes but somehow it turned into a kiss
Funny what is dog name? Cute
Love her! Her tail says it all! Yep, gotcha where I want Cha!
That doggie is sooo cute!!🥰 ❤
😂😂😂
So cute!😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
She said don't skip out on the seasoning mama. 😂🤣
😝🤣🤣🤣 I was like, “Wait, what???”
Placebo has become effective
I tried that with my GSD and he wasn't impressed.
Thats NOT ridiculous. MY DOG DOES THE SAME THING, BUT EXPECTS CHKN OR STEAK TO BE IN THE BOWL WHEN I PUT OT BACK DOWN😂😂😂 NOW THATS RIDICULOUS 😢that I do it😅
YOU DIDNT PUT NOTHING TO THAT FOOD
😂
He's extra smart... Hr knows the difference between dog food and loved food
😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Rack city!
Sweet Girl ❤❤❤❤
Funny my wife cooks the same
Big deal.  I"ve had girlfriends that were 10x more high maintenance.  :-)
It seemed more tantalizing l to me too.😁 Mommy makes good stuff.
Fix this damn food girl and stop playing I’m hungry 😂😂😂
That do has you trained.  Now go make me a sandwich and fetch me a beer.  And, I'm not talking to the dog!
😂😂😂😂😂
Lol got to cook
omg that's hysterical...!!! 😂
Please give her some extra with her dry food. Salmon oil, a little wet food or even an egg. She is a beauty of a dog. Treat her with extra❤
😂
Said I'm not a dog. I'm family.
The sounds makes it good,  she in the background looking like all the trimmings 😂😂😂😂
I tried this with my pittbull, he was excited, ran to his dish then gave the the evil eye & walked away.
It's bc its trained 😮‍💨
Maybe you could feed your dog more than a .20c meal 😂😂
Not to mention the dog being demanding you might want to hold the dog accountable for that make him wait if he's going to be that demanding
Ma'am did you happen to know that that dog was going to be like that when you adopted him
How funny! I do something like this before my two Shepards will eat as well. Then I do the yummy nummy voice and have to stay to watch them eat. If I walk away…they follow. No matter what’s in their food dish, they will follow me.
it deficient you forget to add love™
This vignette should be titled, “Who is the bigger idiot?, the dog or the owner?
What no gravie 😅
Love how the dog sits and waits patiently for her food. Nice looking dog
Someone spoiled her....
This dog learned to see uncooked food as bad, and it is disgusted by it. Just like we humans don't like uncooked food, eventhough we can develop a taste for it.  Sorry, but it's your fault, this didn't develop over night, and there is a high probability you trained him to do this.  (I hope you take this with love, I am not judging anything and definitely not trying to be harsh)
I wish i could fool my boy like that into eating his veggies😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
Very smart dog but loves you just as much your very special to her and would protect you with her life
My dog is like this too!   So goofy!  We have programed them!
😂😂😂😂
😺😸😹😻🐾🐾
Hilarious
My dog was the same, I had to pick up the bowl, move the food around with my hand, and put the bowl back, only then he would eat. And if he could ever see the bottom of his bowl, he wouldn't eat. Probably why I had to "stir" his food to even it out
YUM - YUM ...
😂😂😂 precious baby just needed that made with love flavor
Just beautiful! You're  a good mama!
Hysterical...I have tosit with mine so he doesn't miss anything  😂
na but fr Quit Doing that bs And Give her some real food  Not Junk Food Do your research
Placebo spices
That is hilarious. I love it.😂😂❤
😂😂😂😂
Look what you have done to your dog
You could have actually put some olive oil in the processed, gross food….
Don't think it's the dog..
I loooooove German shepherds! They are thee smartest dogs
Your dog is what some call, High As Phuck
she wants homemade food. What is wrong with that?
😂😂😂
Dog is spoiled and beautiful. Do u have pups yet.
Omg that’s my younger dog. My older dog has special dietary needs so now the younger one has expectations. 😂😂😂
Absolutely amazing
Well if your like me ,,,and I know U R.. I can't figure out how the dog so spoiled,‼️‼️🇺🇸
I love that you do that for her ❤😂 She's definitely part of the family!❤❤❤
And whos fault do you think that is???
welcome to my world, chewey does the same thing
Hilarious
We all just want some extra special attention. 😊
Maybe daisy duke shorts are just not for you.
OMG!!! How cute is that? My cat has to have his food dumped out and fresh put in every time he hits the bowl...cat bowl that is...💜
Im finding my dog is the same😂 she wants me to spoof up her meals too.😂
Betraying a trust, lady.
Wow, nicely played, people will really believe anything won't they
Surely that's just conditioning, the dogs doing it for you if anything the dog interrupted that it's supposed to wait for those noises before it can eat.
My dog does this too 😂
Aliens are watching us like never mind. REG19
Sounds like our dogs! 😡
Mines same exact way gotta also add shredded mozzarella too
You've been duped girl, get her
She thinks I'm stupid 😂😂😂😂❤ look how she's looking at her 😂😂😂😂❤
Make it  special 😂
She said put some love in mama
If she was in the matrix she would take the blue pill 😂
She's a smart one.
Don't diss your master, lol.
She is so spoiled, and i love it!!
Mine is the same way 😫😫
She Wants Some Chicken 🍗🐔 Nuggets.
Shepards are intelligent dogs...
Imagination on another level 😂😂😂
She’s got standards 😊
Lol 😂😂😂
WHY HAVE A DOG?
She just want to be part of your eating habits
She sees you cooking and wants the same treatment
This proves that the food you give your dog is trash!! Step your game up!
Why is my dog like this?
My cat does the same thing. I have to stir the food first, or he won't eat it.
Delulu is the selulu😍
❤Awe what a sweetheart!
U gotta have  foreplay ...else it don't taste good....dinner I mean
My dog is the same way!! I thought she was the only one haha
Poor thing
I truckin love it !!! I’m ova here cryin it’s soo funny !
She know we do it because it taste better she paying attention
You no that dry processed dog food is not good for them .
So sweet!! I love dogs more than people
My dog gets veggies and mince, kibble for lunch
That's showing her love.,that u cooked.
You cooked it for your fur, baby💚
@Samantha whaley
😅😅
Eating dry food every day is crummy, give her some canned food too, she'll love you for it!  And you could mix the wet and dry together . It's so much better .
She got you trained LO. L.❤❤❤❤❤❤
My favorite dog breed. 🥰
This is hilarious! Your pup is so adorable! 🥰
SO TRUE!
Hilarious 😂
I have one exactly like that🤪
My dog would totally call me out on that 😂
Are you the same way????!!!!
😂😂😂 smart baby!!!❤❤❤
My dog would look at me like "You didn't put nothing in this. Fix it."
That's my shepherd too!😅😅😅
Your a awesome mom😊
😂. Just needs extra attention after our pets are members of the family
Try putting down a dish of raw meat, say turkey, beef heart or lamb. See if she waits to eat.
An absolute spoilt sweetheart and he deserves every bit of it ❤ Kudos to the owner for loving him so much and for entertaining him everyday ❤ Absolutely Lovely
No wonder a dog is a man’s best friend .. they are really (classy) apart
She's like, "Fix it mama."  We all know there are certain foods that have to be doctored before they have that taste!
Cause the secret ingredient all along was: Love 💗
nice dog but should not work in drug enforcement
Please people do not keep your dogs on a dry food diet only.  Living diet is best for our fur babies.  Dry food is awful!
You taught her that so duh
She has her owner trained
😅😅
My JackShund terrier named Squirrel has the exact same "preferences" LMFAO 😂😆❤
You’re not alone. We also have this crazy routine for breakfast.  Mmm, phantom snackies 😅
It wants LOVE in the food 😂😂😂
And they say dog's are smart?!? 😉 😏
And because you’ve been a good human you can boop my nose
😂😂they have us wrapped!!❤❤🐶
I hope my wife never sees this video.
Aww she just wants you to whip hers up like you do the rest of the family meals lol
Try the Farmers Dog Food or something equivalent to that, she’ll love it 😊
I have to sit and watch my dog eat and tell him what a good boy he is for eating it all up 😮  then he's figured out that it he he's outside and brings me a pebble, that's payment for a treat. unbelievable! 😂😂
Ask yourself how in the world did the DOG   LEARN. this.   You.  trained her then she trained you  Lol.
The dog watches you prepare your meal now she wants the same!!❤❤😂😂 smart dog!!!
Smart  dog.  ❤❤
The way she standing in the background looking to make sure her owner do it had me to through💀😂
I have a cat that's as weird, a ragdoll that I need to pretend to put caramel sauce on her food 😂😂😂 i don't know who the idiot is between us 😂
That’s a good boy
Maybe just really hoping that this time would be the time there would really be something different in that bowl. Animals love their routines!
Conditioned from previously receiving a prepared human meal...the sound of the spoon signals chicken chopped or other tasty items he desires. Cute. Pavlov's bell.
Blossom❤
Makes sense to me, you hadn't cooked it yet 😂❤
She wants it the way you cook your stuff 😅
Intelligent beings appreciate being treated as equals... They want equality like any other living beings would like it.
🎉This is Tooo Cute!!!❤
My Shihzui is the same way. Yes, my Perritto has me trained.😅
😂😂😂
I feel your pain.  My cat won't eat unless I'm with her.
"Just like a woman." - Skeletor
❤
Its the thought that counts 😂
Not just smart, but BEAUTIFUL too! 🤗❤️
She’s actually not ridiculous… it’s called evolving….
She want good food not indistrial food 😂
Yup my German shepherd won’t eat unless her food cut up exactly to 2.5 centimetres
You are the reason why she’s look ridiculous to you !
It’s her commentary!!😂😂
If I was your dog and you feed me just bloody dry food then I will do exactly the same. Dogs need some meat and some steam vegetables. Can you imagine yourself eating the same food day in out?
Omg my German shepherd was the same! Sweet baby! I miss her 😢
Can you say spoiled fur baby
So wrong!
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She need her secret meal very special because she deserves it ❤Queen of her home 😂❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
My Yorkie was the same!
She's like I want what you had duh I'm family too!
Animals keep us grounded.
That's cute
Faked her out!😊
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Precious 💞💞💞
I do the same thing to my Maximus that little Chihuahua. Lol
You're ridiculous feeding your dog garbage unhealthy dry food...At least buy garbage wet food!
Never thought I'd see a dog train a human 😂
Give her some scraps
your dog needs to lose weight
Aaawe such inocence!!❤
My goodness, I thought my dogs were rotten! 💜
I look after my sisters dog when she's out of town and I have to do something similar. She eats dry food in the morning and mixed half dry and wet at night, and she likes the mixed one better so in the mornings I have to stir it up as if theres wet food in there.
🥰❤️🫶🏾
😂😂😂😂😂
She can smell that nothing was added, but that's not what she was going for.  You aren't fooling her.
You have just helped me so much. Thank you
Have a toy poodle that's the someway 😅
And she's watching like don't forget to throw all that pretend chopped food in my bowl...😂😂 she's too cute!!❤
😆👍
She was waiting for you to add the respect and worship. 💅
She watched every single step lol
Omg insane lol
poor dog, you are ridiculous
Jeez give her some scraps lady
Thats a sweet dog  😂 À sweet   mommy to do what makes her happy ...
Don't pull this with you husband, or it will just be you and the dog ;)
She's not ridiculous. She has you well trained. She is actually very smart.
How precious is that!
Like a dog can't SMELL the difference lol. You've been outsmarted!
Fuzzy Nazi dogs are weird.
Omg I have to do the excat same thing ... God luv ya.💙
Shouldn’t be feeding any dog that crap. You try living on Cheerios flavored with meat juice and see how you like it. At least mix some meat with it. Bet the dog has ear wax.
Looks like not much food for a big dog!
Beautiful baby ❤🎉
Well honestly that woman just found out how easy it can be to please a 👨
Nice toe.😮
Theres 2 kinds of dogs worth having; golden retrievers and german shepherds.  Of coarse there's other good dogs but these are my favorite
Im not doing all that. Putting it back…..go hungry tonight. Try again tomorrow. Wont happen again.
Cute my dog is similar
❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂
This is not food, this is chemical poison, feed your animal with natural meat with lots of data and no carbs !!!
Good lord
I loved watching this !
BAM!!😅
ATP fix him a plate and set him at the table
how cute
thats hilarious!
😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
How do you live with yourself after lying to that poor mistreated pup?!?! LOL
I have to pretend to put pills in my dogs food and take atleast 2 minutes letting the kible absorb hot water😢
I've been there.
Lol my dog is the same! Omg
Dog trains human bawaaha
How about ya feed the dog real food...
That extra air was super tasty
Love it; they love routines
I have two like that. The last step is tearing up a slice of cheese as their dinner topper. 😂🐾🐾
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Drie food no good for dogs
O sweet baby!!   She got used to it when you did it bf….. it’s part of her little routine .Very, very smart!!
I met myself in my next life...still a pretentious bitch...
Im going to try that on my husband with a tin of baked beans.
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
😆
Yep, my Pom is the same way!!! If she doesn't see me stir it in a pot, won't touch it, but the magic pot makes it taste better
She is smart ..now ... I love a gourmet dog.  Do cute
She just wanted you to add the hot sauce and the onions
My pet will not eat unless l lift her up and carry her to her bowl. She throws herself on the floor, stiffens her body as if dead and will not move. I have tried ignoring the behavior but she will go without eating. She will move around after a while but will not eat until lifted to her bowl.
Hmmm maybe I should do this. My dog does the same thing
your dog should g at last 1 meal of real human food a day if not your kinda abusing your dog , i started doing it after someone brought it to my attention my 7  dogs health got better they had healthier energy they were in better moods, think if you had to eat the same crap everyday all day its so not cool, with the time it took you to fake your dog you could have prepaired greenbeans  sweet potato and tuna or chicken, its so easy so much healthier, im poor and i can afford it
Boogi dogs, we have one too😂
🤣🤣🤣
One of my dogs won't eat until I give her a hug. We don't deserve dogs; they are too pure and wonderful for words.
Plot twist. Dog wanted some entertainment before eating.
Stop feeding your dog super processed pellets that kill their liver.
My cat does the same 😂…
😂😂😂 I need to do that for my dog
She's adorable❤ Thanks Mom😅
My friend sent this to me and explained the joke since I'm blind. I laughed until  physical tears fell from my eyes. My doodle is just as much a diva but would also eat poop if given a chance.
My dogs do the same thing...lol.
Sooooo cute 🥰
😂😂😂😂😂👍🏾💯
🤦‍♂️🤣
That doesn't look like enough food for a German Shepard 🤔..beautiful dog!!
So cute
Is he single child? Seems like it.....
The dog’s autistic !!! Yep
They dog..........is a women
She likes the special attention is what it is.
You should actuality do that instead of feeding kibble.
Aww, ❤❤❤ love it. I will do the same for my animals ❤❤
Somehow I feel like that dog used to eat better than dry kibble.
Could you make her some steak and potatoes for real? 🙏🏼♥️
My German Shepard is strange about certain things as well 😊
She needs that "BAMM!"
I do the same trick to my dog so he can eat too !!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂 so funny to see how dogs alike!!!
Mine does something similar. You gotta wonder how their minds work sometimes.
maybe its a german shepherd thing. i have 2 and they both are the eaxct same way
It's not the dog. it's the owner who trained her to be that way
Dog needs meat not biscuit
Si, Billy and Billy asks See What
Oh my gosh that reminds me of my dog she won't eat her food until my daughter comes over then she shows her what are good girl she is😂 I love my sweet dog
My kitty liked me making dinner for her... because she loved me.  She would watch, wait, talk over dinner, I'd of course put hot water in the food, turning it into a gravy.
😅😅❤❤
We do the same😂
Your showing too much for this to be a video just about your dog. Sorry to be judgmental.
The Dog response: "It's not about food; it's about the culinary experience"  😂😂😂
He's hoping that one day maybe just one day he'll get a nice meal!😮🥺
Maybe the dogs trying to tell you that home cooked meals are healthier for dogs.
She can smell you didn’t do anything to it tho😂😂 yeah I think she letting u know she’s in charge😂😂 just kidding
My dog the same way… she won’t touch her food until I put some human food in it…
Dogs are awesome!!
Destined to a life of eating dry kibbles. Give him his psychological crutch.
That's just mean hell give her some mayonnaise squirt some lemon on it
I DON'T KNOW THIS DOG BUT I LOVE IT ❤❤❤❤
That dog is so smart!  She trained you so well!!
😂😂😂😂
The extra Ingredients are love & care.
Oh. I can’t imagine how she obtained this learned behavior.  😂😂😂  That’s right mom. You know I roll.
LOL,  I have SEVEN of those!  Not only this, but they all follow me around until the last bowl is filled and set down, just to make sure nobody is getting anything the others didn't get!
My Corgi is the same way.  lol
This dog is so spoiled, just like my mini schnauzer.  They are so smart, demanding, and totally adorable.  Your dog is beautiful.
She deserves real food
Add some shredded carrots and celery.
hoped it was waiting for a green plastic cup, not a reminder of meat
That is so funny😅
Bougie dog! That's adorable.
Yeah I have a toy poodle that refuses all dog food. I’ve been trying to get him to eat kibble for a while now. I’ve tried different brands, sizes, protein and fat content, flavours, the whole shabang. Nope. He just wants roast chicken. I dont know what else to do.
Mine are the same way😅
How are your boobies
Yeah, I got one like that…
"That's delicious gourmet" 😂
Dog *Hey, watch this*
Thats learned behavior which you taught the dog. It learned from watching you. So, thats your fault.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😅
And she sat there to make sure you do it right...lol ,  HAHAHAHAHA
She remembers that 5 star meal,an will order it every time😂
Amazing how ever dog got different personalities, just like people. Wonderful 😊
She just wants love put into her food
Aww she so cute and stupid ❤❤
Farmers dog
Dogs rule!
Poor baby. She wants real food. Can you imagine eating that crap all the time?
Why don't you tell us what you are adding?
Dog tring to be a CAT
She’s trying to hint to you that she wants actual cooked food not kibble
she wants gravy...give her real gravy ffs
Then the dog won't eat 🙂 it will finally touch the food when hungry enough
Yes, they know microwave sound!
THAT'S LOVING UR SPOILED FUR BABY 😂 WITH GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS 🐕 A MOTHER'S LOVE 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 😘😘😘❤️
Oh my god my cats the same , i pretend tomstir n put new pack n then i have to pet her n ask her to eat, n i also hv to sit there n keep her company . She gets hungrys but she cnt decided between food n me so she wants both in one room
😂😂😂😂
Cats would never
Look at this meal and look at this MILF..both are absolutely gorgeus❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂❤
She wants her food made with love too …. She been watching tik tok
what dog, all I can see is her rack
"That's right hooman, hook me up"
What the heck are u foing and using?  Lol
Musta been a cat in a past life
You meanie ...... poor dudett all she want is a bit of bratwurst ...!!
She wants you to give her something special like you cook for your family she believes she's part of the family
You're not putting anything on that food.
I actually rhink this dog was pampered maybe by her previous owner, maybe give her some specialty care veggies and fruit. Pamper our fur babies, we are their entire life.
Maybe In her past life her human made her cooked real food.    Mine get a raw diet mixed with fresh veggies.  They are spoiled!
Equal rights!
Oh my
😂
My dog does the same thing.
hope she gets special food from time to time :(
Nice TaTas❤
She said put some sauce on it!
Hahaha sounds like my Terrier he's 15 going on 5.. Won't eat unless you mix wet and dry food together..lol... and he actually watches us to make sure that it's right..❤❤I love my baby...
Actually you can add some vegetables or meat
No. Dogs smell.  10000000 pct.  She put real meat under the rocks.  See the jumpcut
_One day she won't be around anymore and you will have wished you would of fed her better like she deserves!_
She just wants a healthy meal 🥹 everyone deserves that 🥹❤️
🤣
Hey he thinks he deserves to be treated like the rest.  A human being 😀😂🤣
Everything taste better when its made with love lol
My dog has to play before she starts eating. She's a Shepard too and she'll want me to throw the ball for about 15 minutes before she starts taking bites between chasing the ball and bringing it back. It's honestly kind of hilarious.
Ha ha ha ha ha special one
My god that is cute
oh my LORD
Who is more trained the dog or owner
So special
Maybe you forgot that you gave her some human food once! A dog never forgets the taste of real food!😢
Maybe you forgot that you gave her some human food once!
😂😂😂😂
It has the most important ingredient. Love!
Omg this is too funny 😂
When you picked up the green bottle, she licked her lips and gave that look,  dinner gonna be good tonight!
He just likes the routine. It makes him feel safe and special.
Boogie
Cuz you keep doing it lol
😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
That’s a well loved dog
I feed my dog chicken and rice. Don't be lazy. Cook for your dogs
how do u figure out that your dog wants this without TEACHING them this?
COOK. MY MEAT
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dogs huuuuuuuuuuuman😂
😂
😂😂😂❤
❤😂I love it the dog wants to be showed the same love all the humans get.
youve done this to this dog...ive fed my dog human foods his entire life and the day i had to stop he would not eat unless i did this exact thing.
It ain't a home cooked meal if their ain't no love in it.
Poor thing only eats one kind of processed meal ALL THE TIME.
I really love how you started this in the first place. Obviously she wouldn't eat one day, but what made you think ill try do this and see if she eats it, or did you once add veg chopping to it or left over and since then she won't eat until you do this thinking she's getting the chopped veg or something? ❤
Dog is like I have taste your cooking before it taste exactly like this.
Ohh this is so precious ❤❤❤ we lost our baby poodle whonwas our special boy for 14 yrs so please gove her or him all tje love you can because when they leave this earth tjeyre ao missed Nd leave a hole in yoir heart ❤️
😂😂😂😂
know who you are ....if your fancy , well then , your fancy ! 😅
So cute and adorable and utterly ridiculous and darling. And doggo has you well trained!
put some real food mixed with that crap kibble
Damn 😊
😅😅😅
Your are hot as fuck....Just sayin.
This is hilarious. How did this even happen?
Spoilt
I LOVEEE IT !  Shes smart enough to know that MoMA makes other noises when shes cooking for the family and she wants that also.
I would want real food too
CANNOT BLAME HER! LADY, WOULD YOU WANT TO EAT FRY CRACKERS EVERYDAY?
😂😅😂😅❤
My dogs would call 🐂💩
😂
Dogs are the BEST!
I’m trained to do the fake food prep for my grand dog too.🤣🤣🤣
Well from one woman to the 4 legged woman, you should completely understand her idiosyncratic 😵‍💫 behavior, since when do you dames make sense??...Thats why us men stopped trying to understand why women are CRAZY 🤪
What is the _Youtube comment_ version of doing this?
you probably shouldn't own a dog if you're submissive to it. that's a disaster waiting to happen
dog wanted to be spoiled....
Seems like she wants some real food
Not food that's processed crap that dehydrate your mutt
Its not about the ingredients ITS ABOUT THE RITUAL
You added the ❤️ love, most important nutrients
My dog would not fall for that. I tried. He tipped the whole thing over.
It's Peter Pans dog from Neverlands.
Yah its called love
🎉❤❤
Mind over matter
He sees how much you put into making your food ,so he wants the same effort
Whats the cup there for, lol 🥰🐶
Dig didn’t get that way on its own. Share the whole story…
Because she wants the secret ingredient: love.
😅😂
My dog is exactly the same
Just admit it , she owns you... 😂😂😂
She has standards. Please 💅🏾
😅😅😅😂
Get it right ❤
This dog want to eat real food , give him some meat 😊
She'll eat when She gets hungry enough and that is all there is!!
She wants her food cooked not taken out of a pack
It would be so much better actually topped with something or even better without the dry worthless non-food in her bowl
That dog has trained it's Mama that is hilarious.. love it
That's because you put love into it
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That chopping board has now become contaminated because it came into  contact with the dog bowl. It needs to be properly sanitised to avoid animal to human infectious diseases.
So cute!
My dog did the same thing. Its hysterical,
My cat does the same thing. 😅
😂😂😂
Funny video, even if the dog was just waiting for you to give the EAT command.
hahahah, smart dog!!
There’s a message there.  The thought of kibble alone…
😅😅😅😅just like my niece dog also she has t put water then heat it up b4 the dog eats it😅😅😅😅😅
Imagine that food in a dogs bowl and they want my chicken nuggets 😊
This dog is a trip lol to funny she knows that she wants her momma to make her dinner special !!!
My 4 cats do the same thing! 😂😂😂
Yall have hurt my soul with the passed on doggie comments. Believe me when I say I am so sorry for your loss. God bless yall
I have to do the same thing to my husband
😂
My dog dont eat dog food. She likes it with little bit of rice more chicken pieces. It should also have soup. If soup is not enough she will pretend to lick her bowl then suddenly returns sitting down.😂 if u tried feeding more rice than chicken. She will finish all the chicken and leave half of the rice then wait after an hour or two. Once u go to the kitchen, she will sit down on the spot she chose to sit whenever we asked her to sit and wait for her food. When she sits there, it means she wants her chicken rice.😅 sometime if too much rice is on the bowl, she will refuse to eat but she will be sitting next to her bowl. Put it on a small bowl with less rice and more chicken and soup then she will eat 🤣
It makes him feel special… I get it.   Put the same thing in mine you put in yours…
I have a sausage dog and he does the same thing every morning he will eat at night or in the morning he's a player
ആ പാവത്തെ പറ്റിച്ചു 💔
🙂‍↔️it's dinner And!  A Show 🐝 itch
Exactly what my dog does lol
😂😂😂😂😂
It needs just a little bit of love ❤️
My dog won’t eat a hotdog unless we put it in the microwave.
I fear for the day when the dog goes "Wait a minute...".
😅
Placebo effect😊
That’s mother instinct. 😊
She's pretty smart' She trained YU' 😊Didnt she,?!  Nysh ha Ha'
Omg! She is hilarious
Brilliant.  I had a Boxer that wouldn't eat until I said, Deeeee-licious!
My dog, is the same way
My aussie refuses to touch his food or water until I've cooked dinner and served my boys then myself. Then I act like I put some in with his food and he wolfs it down!
I totally got lost in the dog’s hot owner 😍
Reïncarnatie ❤️
That’s hilarious 😆
That is hilarious!!
I can’t tell who’s the attention seeker here.
Maybe you need to give her something other than manufactured cereal product
My dogs the same 😅have to put more made up food before eating it lol 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂❤
Haha too adorable 😍
Mine as well... Who do they think they are 😆😆😆😆
The dog is a culinary MacGyver!
😂😂😂😂
My dad's dog always had to have fresh water, even if his water was only thirty minutes old. He would bark at the bowl until somebody would get up and change his water. King charles spaniel go figure.
That dog is precious.  She's my favorite breed, I love them.  She's so cute waiting patiently.
Wish that wld work for mine..loll💕💕💕
Spoilt dog 😂
Love it❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dog knows that dry food sucks.  Trying to get a decent meal
What was in the microwave
Sweet , looks like he needs a little water ❤
Wow, is that a teenage girl inside that dog body? So boujee! 😅 But so smart and precious!
Why Shepards are the best
Love and patience was the ingredient sought in the preparation.  Your special time and attention provides these ingredients.
I love her !! I Cook for my dogs for real 😂
You all are crazy. It WILL eat, if you just leave ot there long enough.
My MIL cared for our dog when we went to Africa. 2 days into the trip my husband “had” to call her; he found out that my dog would not eat! Figured out that she only put his pill on the food, she did not take the meat mallet and bang the heck out of it before putting the crumbles onto the food. She did that while on the phone, problem solved!
Kibble: ❌  Kibblé: 😤✅
Not ridiculous.
Whats the Solo cup for?
This is so my Emma Jane! 😅
Omg I’m going to try that with my German!! I have to put something in with her food before she eats. Even if it’s just a little piece of meat and then she will eat.
Alright now add some Real shii to it😭
Priceless!
Dog sure has a cute mommy❤
Spoiled, and sweet as sugar.
my goodness this dog is quite a genius !
I tried that with my dog and didn't work 😭😭😭
lol
This is TOO funny!
My dog is the exact same! If she won’t eat it I pick it up do some chopping and mixing sounds and give it back to her and she gobbles it up 😂😂😂
My dog does the same thing! Crazy!
Spoiled dog I put food in front of my cat  no problem lol 😅
well you are feeding her kibble, feed her real food: chicken, rice, carrots.  Can you imagine if you ate the same thing every single day of your life?
😂😂♥️
Beautiful baby maybe she’s asking for something other then dry food, try putting some fruit and veggies and coconut oil in there she might love it😊😊😊
The "gourmet" killed me
Absolutely spoiled.  I LOVE IT!!
I believe she likes mom’s cooking
My dogs have me trained well like this also.  No regrets.
My dog's a lot smarter than that, she knows what's up, she can't be fooled blacklablife
My cat is the same way
My Shepard will only eat wet food and it has to be served when I feed the rest of the pack(my kids) . She also prefers water straight from the bathroom faucet, not a bowl.
She’s a 🆒 doggee..!
That’s fabulous she likes you nice vibes when you give her attention, very nice one.
Hahahahaha
This is your fault!!!! you shouldn't have done it the first time Now she expects Special attention from now on.  So give the baby the food the way she wants it.  God I love German Shepherd
❤
Aweee so cute
Can you say codependent enabler and bad pet owner?
😂😂😂 make it right. She licked her lips and everything.
Just put the food in the bowl. I guarantee anyone, she will eat when she gets hungry
My cats are the same. If they don’t see me put it in the bowl, it isn’t there.
I have a Cat who is the same way . I gotta build it up for her and get her all excited , then shell be waiting and cant wait till u set the bowl fown
Dog: Mommy, put your blessing on it You: ok my love, chop chop, swish swish 😂😂😂
Dog like…”Ooh, you put yo foot in dis one. Now Imma put my foot in it, kick it over and let YOU clean it up! The lies you tell!” 😂
Shepards are great !!!
that's hilarious and awesome at the same time.!!!!!! never seen a dog do that.....
How precious.  You Trained doggie well.
I have the same thing with my cat. He doesn't understand the concept of a slice of ham, no, it has to be cut into pieces. Even pate has to be cut into pieces... strange animals sometimes..
Please stop feeding her so called "dog food" my dog died from it. Vet will never tell you this just like our food is full of poison. Buy her less quality meat and feed her with meat. Dogs just like humans are carnivours. People are slowing killing their own pets.
Mama u put yo foot-nom nom nom no da whole nom nom nom ankle in this one. Nom nom make sure u keep da recipe
You should put a little crumble of sirloin or something in there once in a while for an extra treat, but I’m sure you do for snacks now and then or something. She is absolutely gorgeous. Oh my goodness love them every second you can because when they’re gone, It’s a very empty place is not a home without your dog🐾❤
congratulations,you just spoilt your dog
She wants her meal made with love ❤️
😅😅😅
Poor little dog having to eat Kibble 😢
I have a pit who has thabe the REAL DEAL, and the service  2! He's worth it!
She’s a Shepherd and deserves a little more attention. Look how patient she waits.❤❤
I have a cat like that! 😂
Cute.
How did you discover this is what it took ti get her to eat???
There I was thinking I had the only crazy dog that did this. My dog is no Shepherd she is a Thai street/soi dog.
That is because dog food is poison for animal. So to eat the crap they have to use some imagination
The dog wants/needs real actual food. Any thing that is called "dog food" of any type, is garbage. It's like feeding a person only bread and water. The dog actually has all the comon sense in this whole interaction. We aren't going to make it, are we... 🐶😸🐰🤔
You both need help.....lol.
You, too, I see.
❤
She needed mommy to add the love!
lol that’s hilarious 😂
yeah, we've been doing that for years.
Awesome and helirious
I agree with all the comments, but I gotta ask: what’s up with the upside down red Solo cup?
in other words the dog knows you're feeding her shit...and you trick her to make her eat it.
Aww this is such a sweet clip/ video.  This dog has s beautiful personality!
Who else is going to APPRECIATE your cooking skills with such obvious enthusiasm??!! Betcha husband doesn't even say THANK YOU after a good meal 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂. You take care of YOUR BIGGEST FAN!!!
My dog does the same thing, but I actually add homemade dog soup with vegetables and meat in it. Your dog should come to our house.
This has to be one of the funnier dog videos. I don't remember if it was my dog or cat, but one of them used to do this exact same thing.
My cat does the same thing
Home made is always better lol… this is hilarious!
She’s like you better get in there and prep me a proper meal!! 😂😂😂
She’s Amazing ❤❤❤
I thought this was going to be another dog that won't eat until prayer 😂 boy was I wrong  lol
Wow you really tricked him into thinking he was getting a decent meal . Nice
I LERVE her! 🥰
Feed her raw meals please
🤣🤣🤣
Dogs are smart but act like toddlers, give “more” treats by splitting them in half.
That’s just so damn cute
At least yours believes you, mine don’t fall for it we have to add a splash of chicken broth lol
The red cup?
Get her her own apartment and a Job she be alright LoL
THIS EXACTLY WHAT RELIGION, MEDIA AND POLITICS ARE DOING TO YOUR BRAINS AS WELL
she just wants it made with love too
Lol...I do the same with my German Shepherd.OMG im not alone!!..lol
ACTUALLY THE DOG HAS YOU WELL TRAINED 😂
Look at those knockers
Mine vis like that and will not eat unless chess is on top
Dog behavior, completely normal and approved  Dog partner, absolutely approved . I did happen upon a really good recipe. To add to it.  10 days of food. Big girl.  Far more time effective.  My girl is panicking way before the kettle is done.
My dog won’t eat till we all sit down for dinner
Spoiled dog, i wonder if you have to wipe its ass to...
If you love your dog give a meet, he's a carnivore give them good food no meat and potatoes give him eggs cheese State poultry and fish. If you love your dog that is. By the way that's what you should be eating also chunky
❤❤❤❤❤
She's not ridiculous. She wants to be treated like a member of the family.
The owner has spoiled the dog. LOL
:P
My poodle does the same thing!
Maybe feed your dog real food and not processed bs, and he’ll eat it, this is sad.
You're full of it😂 You cute The dog is okay
The dog is sitting in the background like she really thinks she is fooling me trying to manipulate me with how she's doing what she's doing
So cute! What a good human trainer!
Love
😂
But how did that start 🙄
A greedy person reincarnated as a dog will still be greedy
So cute
what are you wearing
She wants what she wants!!
She just wants meat. She will eat then.
Sound's just like mine!😂
My dog Is the same lmao
Thats a strange cat
This is my dad's dog to the T looks just like her too! Lol do all German Shepard act this way???
Hahaha,spoiled,and sweet❤
Sad thing is, it looks like just kibble.
..love at first sight. you, not the dog
Cause someone at some point actually gave it a decent meal and now she's with your broke ass and you don't want to
Haha very picky like me i see.
Yes dogs do expect to get what their family eats even if u pretend...love it  ❤❤  some people say it's just a dog  but no not even close. Beautiful dog  They have us trained quite well  😂😂😂  😂😂
😂😂😂
My dog will not eat unless I give him appetizers first.  I kid you not.  I have to give him bits of his food before putting the bowl in front of him or he won't eat.
How funny
She should've left a Tip
Well-trained dog doesn't do anything until he gets permission
You... are amazeballs.❤
Hilarious!!
Just your love in it the main ingredient ❤
typical toddler mindset
I bet you my soul the dog knows nothing went into that bowl and he just wanted to be entertained before eating 😂. They literally can see the aura of what theyre smelling, I cant explain it the way I learned it but this dog is 100% pampered and loved haha
This is hilarious 😂
😂❤Doggie phsycology!
Dogron Ramsey
Super spoiled lil girl 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣😍
My dog was the same, special diet because of chronic illness, but I would put a smidge of low sodium chicken broth in it. He would eat without it. Then, because his intake was also regulated he would get ticked because he wanted more. He would splash his water bowl and knock his empty food bowl all over. Such a character.
She deserves more than some dry ass dog food,hows  a steak or nice beef liver🤨
My shepherd would eat u if u didn’t give her food fast enough 😂she friendly dogs but loves her food
Plecebo works on dogs
Hilarious!!!
It's called adding love to the meal instead of just dumping it in a tray. Had a bad day and just dumped the food in the tray and put it infront of her. She didn't eat it even tho she always instantly empties it within 10 seconds. (golden retriever) since that day I always treat her food with love and patience.
a lil bit of extra effort makes dogs feel special, especially if they observe you preparing food for yourself/others
The dog said " oh no not kibble straight out of the bag again "😂😂
That's because she needs her dinner made with lots of love :)
Hysterical 😅
Too cute
Dog thinks he's a people and needs food microwaved. Lol!
Get her some meal toppers. Satisfies her bougieness and add nutrition!
Don’t lie to the dog. Maybe actually add something extra
This is so dang cute 💞
We don't train dogs, dogs train us!
Put meat in it ok
That is too cute
Oh my how cute...
Need some seasonings
If u really love her please give real food
FIX IT MAAAAHM
Does he or she ever get other food or just dry. Have you ever tried Farmers? I understand what you are showing us. The dog is precious and beautiful. ❤️🐕‍🦺
That's exactly how 90% of pharmaceuticals work in humans too.
Why don't you give the dog some peas and carrots or something that she likes
How did this even become a "thing"
My dog is exactly the same! 😂 If he turns his nose up at his food, I have to get his fork and stir it for him and then he eats it! I'm incredibly well-trained! 😂
LoL
😂😂😂😂 Oh my God German sheperds are so cute We had one but he died long ago.
wow I did the same to my Jack Russell..🤗🤗🤗
It’s sweet. Very kind of you to make her feel so special ❤
Somebody tought her this somehow. Possibly by introducing her to table scraps which is a big no no. If so, well then you've created a monster. Bad idea to give dogs or cats table scraps. Number one, is a very bad habit as you can see. After a while it becomes troublesome and annoying. Two, human food contains spices which is like poison to their digestive system. Don't do it if you love your animals. Discipline must be maintained no matter what and at all cost. 😺
She needs real meat mixed in with the dry  Only dry not good.
She wanted it fancy.
Mine wants a sprinkle of shredded cheese or a squirt of whipping cream.
Good shephards LEAD not follow❤
Devils IS in the details😂😂❤❤❤
She's awesome ❤❤
You Are Going To Hell
That is preciously adorable! Haha 🐕
That is so nasty having a big unsanitary dog like that in your home.
She's from Neverland give her a break. Peter used to imagine up banquets for her.
She knows, she just checking she's STILL IN CONTROL OF YOU😂😂😂❤
That's a real PEDIGREE 😅
She is beautiful, and so smart ❤️❤️
It’s the patiently waiting in the background as her food gets faked prepared for me 😂😂 too cute
my cocker spaniel is the same way - it has to be prepared the same special way or he will leave it there and refuse to eat it- I'm talking more than a day until it's fixed the way he expects it 🤣🤣🤣
👱‍♀️....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
Dumb dog. Lol.  My dogs would know.  Iv tried to trick them.
I go through this on a daily basis love it! Not really but yeah
So smart and sweet
My dog would absolutely call my bullshit. He picks up the kibble and then drops it on the floor like dirt
They say dogs have a great sense of smell and then every now and then I see something like this and im pretty sure they are just stupid
SHE KNOWS THAT YOU WILL FIX IT THE WAY SHE WANTS 😂😂😂 YOU ARE WELL TRAINED 😂😂
That's  my dog❤
As cute as that is, you let that dog get hungry and they'll eat.
My son saw this and tried it with our dog. He shook sprinkles, took spoon and tapped it. That damn dog ate the food til was empty. I said guess she needed that extra flavor of air added to it
well, if you're doing all that anyway...why not actually put a little sauce in there for it, IF you love him/her.
😂😂😂
To cute and funny
The dog thinks she's a human so demands that same treatment.
This is hilarious
It's funny, but she wants to make sure the process was done, she probably observed you cooking and knows you do "something" to the food before serving, like that dog who buys skewers and pays with a green LEAF.
You're the one who conditioned the dog to do that. That makes you the ridiculous one.
Who’s a good dog?? Is it you huh?? Yes it is a good dog!!!
Lol mine did the same
I guarantee that she'll eat it when she gets hungry enough.
Just a precious creature.
Poor dog is sick of that dry crap and wants real food that sees you cook!
😂
Only a German Shepherd ❤LOL Gotts love em
Put on clothes woman
Ridiculous translates to absolutely adored ❤
Kinda mad that a dog like that just gets plain kibble
LMFAOOOOOOOOOO 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She wants you to feed her the way you used to. really, no surprise
"Waiter! There's something wrong with my soup." Waiter takes the soup into the kitchen, reheats it after 2 minutes and brings it back out. "Thanks a lot. Now it's good"
She has you trained
Gotcha bih 😭💀
😂
He just wanted some specially restaurant treatment it’s just the sound that make it all better
😂 OMG I thought we were the only ones that had to do this for our GS. He even got to a point that he would only eat off an actual plate that came out of the micro. SMH. These furry kiddos are way too smart.
Gotta love dogs with personality.
She got a human soul and the furry angel need to see that mom treat her the same, she feels that you care, she is so adorable, that is respect she would that is your baby all animal that gave send in this life have a special soul they are smart and carrying they understand you, but they are so faithful and caring and loving, this is soooooooo cute 🥰
❤❤❤best video ever
Love it
My julia would not eat a chip until I put dip on it.
😄 C'est la gamelle Placebo 😊😂😂
Hahahahahah!!!! I love it!
Hibachi…
You made him that way. Then you complain about it!
My dog gets the same special ingredients
"The dog is absolutely ridiculous" Im guessing its the owner
But it is also very nice to really put in extra num nums from time to time.
We pretend to eat it and ours will then eat.
It's a cute video but no way the dog is actually like that lol
She wants to feel like a human too!
Proof that all women are difficult
Funny furbaby! ❤
She has some nerve, LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jeez I’d hate to be her husband then. 😂
Add an egg
Really a fantastic pair of Boooooooooooobs. 😮  What was the video about?
You'll never convince me 'Love' doesn't make things taste better. It's like when someone cuts your toast into triangles despite it being more effort. It's Love.
1.) Yes, you should give your dog oil to every meal; salmon oil preferably, but rape or olive works too 2.) You should pour some water in the dry kibbles before giving it, or it will suck up all the moisture in the stomach, since it needs to swell before being digested
Hahahahahaha
She is just making sure your doing your job correctly
THE RITUAL!
MINDSET!
That’s similar to our beagle. His food has to be doctored so he’ll eat his pills.
I have tried this so many times with my Great Dane and every single time he walks over to that bowl and is like “Don’t insult my intelligence, human!” and walks away until I actually add something! 😂😂
This dog is absolutely! Beautiful!
Omg this is so imagination
Hahaha, maybe it’s a shepherd thing because my male is the same way!
So cute ❤
Poor dog give em what he wants real food
Ahhhh....she reminds me of my Samson. He was the best boy dog ever ! R.I.P. Samson.
She just needed her meal kicked up a notch with extra love❣️ Too stinkin cute 🥰
Wow that's too funny😂❤
I see  ridiculous dog reels on FB.  This worth watching.
Because you have trained her that way. Why don’t you stop making it about you and command her to eat!
Cute but I still would not eat or feed it to my dog, dry food is a treat not a meal. It is highly cancerous as a main meal.
😂
Bro, hook him up. Don't do him like that
She watches you prepare your food every day and wants the same treatment 😂😮
Hilarious!
😂😂😂my cat LITERALLY DOES THE SAME THING
Must be a female dog, delulu
I love it!!
that's what dog called "ritual" 😂
Aaaaaaaaaaw!❤❤❤
Top tier dog-restaurant 😂
He's not ridiculous, it's you. That don't understandard what he's asking you for is a little bit of meat. Some type of protein chicken is pretty cheap. Boil some pieces really good. No ingredients except honey, if you want every time.  Or any time you're gonna feed him. You can add a little bit of love to it. Dogs are really smart. It's us that's burnt up so many brain cells that we tend to blame it on the dog or cat. Husband-wife, you know what I mean.  God bless you and your dog.Remember they only have anywhere from thirteen to twenty years of life treat them good because most of them would die for you
She wants raw meat . 🥩
MILFFFFF
Lol😅
She wanted food made with love.
I’m literally crying from laughing.
Night and day! Much better upgraded meal!
Dog demands princess treatment
Dogs not eating meat. Not good. Kidding him that he's actually getting good nutrients. Not from sinthetic vits
Dog in the kitchen 🤮🤢. Dog hair everywhere. Stop babying your animals. They're animals
OMG!  Lol.  Just lol❤
He like the cooking meal you prepare for everyone...
I get it!!!
My dog does the same thing LoL so funny. Just can't help loving them.
😂😂😂 love this dog .. too cute❣️
Hahaha animals are funny 🤣
And he is just watching her 😅
😂😂🤣
The importance and power of ritual
Made with love
😂 that’s so adorable making sure you made it the right way
Aww that’s so cute 🥰
Shes wishes it was real meat not grain
You can add some fish oil, my dogs love it, also if you microwave it slightly (10 seconds 900W) it will release more smell and they eat it faster
😅😅😅😅😅
Learnt behaviour? Owner before used to do something extra maybe?
Doggo knows her self-worth. You'd better learn it too, Mom.
😢 prepare something special for him
Priceless
How did this routine even come about? 🤔😂
This is hilarious because I do the same thing with my dog.  Then I pretend to take a test bite.
This dog has you trained stop for a day shell eat it
That dog said, " Woman if u don't put some love in this bowl."😂❤
Oh how funny. Not ridiculous but smart as whip and has you train well! 😮
My dog won’t eat until I add a teaspoon of my food into her bowl. She will wait for upwards of an hour or more to eat until I do so. I am well trained lol.
I do the same thing! 😂😂😂
Lol
Those shorts are ridiculous
My Hana needs to have her water out of her Special Cup, a ceramic coffee mug- even though I keep two dog bowls full of water in the kitchen and bathroom
I blame the pet owner.
My German Shepherd died a few months ago. Enjoy that special puppy everyday.
Love it.😂😂😂
I fake my dog out too.😮
😂❤ amazing.🤣
Isn't dining supposed to be performative?
Lol I'm definitely trying this
I have seen that happen before in other videos with other peoples doggos.
You might think about smarting the dog LOL but the dog has you trained Period LOL
Thats how 5 star hotel works
😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a smart puppy! 😅
she's telling you she wants real food and not that cardboard your feeding her
That's how MK mind control works.  They tell us one thing to build an illusion then deliver something else.
Awe, your dog went to the same human training school mine did. It was worth it to get to spoil them all the years I was blessed with them in my life. I miss them more than life, and you made me smile, thank you!
😂😂😂
She wants veggies!
Precious dog ❤ at least she has imagination. No living being wants to eat the same dry food every damn day. The lady should eat dry grape nuts cereal every day for and see how long she lasts
Wow
My cat does the same thing! 😺😸😹
The dog says at least I fet the illusion of having a gourmet  meal.  Beautiful dog and knows what it wants.
Now it's been made with love. Taste much better
Lol
It don't matter what you do she is going make you make her food no matter what you do
She just don't know
Smart dog
What were you doing the day you did it the first time?  Perhaps someone else treated her to something you didn’t know about? I MUST KNOW!! Is there a sequel request button ? Hello??
You know the dog can see you right?
😂😂😂
😂😂
I have to lay on the bed with my dog.
He just needs some love and that you give the special care to prepare his food!
La loca del barrio
Too funny!
Mommy is so tricky
❣️❣️❣️
Your dog just wants you to add LOVE ❤mama
Poor dog
She looks like a big spoiled baby 🍼 in every way❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
Yep, they train us well. I too cook gourmet food. :-P
That baby is precious please continue pampering her when you lose them there's a hole that just can't be filled what is a precious precious baby
My Cairn Terrier is ridiculous like that....ugh!
My dogs do that too. I take a spoon and stir it up, add a couple drops water and they devour it. Won’t touch it before I do that.
So cute!
😂❤.  Smart puppy 😍
Must be a German Shepherd thingy. I have a half Shepherd, half Golden Retriever and ny boy Buck does the very same thing to me too;). Bwahaha Lol. He thinks he has to have what his mommy cooked and is eating too. Now ,he will go as far as if ge gets a tadte of gourmet food, then he will eventually go eat every but of  his dogfood in his bowl. He now also wont go outside to pee or pooh  unless I go outside  with him. Haha Lol😂😅
I'd let her go hungry till she eats.
OMG I LOVE YOUR PUP ❤❤
So no is man going to mention it?
Hilarious! Love this!
LOL! Thats is one cute and spoiled dog! Moms got a nice front yard too!~
She will figure it out, then what.
AWWWWW WELL YOU SPOILED YOUR BABY NOW GIVEN THEM WHAT THEY WANT & THE WAY THEY LIKE IT 🤣😆 TO ADORABLE MOMS SPECIAL TOUCH
they are so funny
I have to do the same thing for my dog.
this is why dogs should be outside
Hysterical 😭 You’ve been well trained…
I say this with no I’ll intent but , after growing up with many animals I believe that they would like to eat real food like us and different meals often as they would in the wild no animal or human should have to eat the same thing every day and it’s been proven to be much healthier for them to eat as they would in the wild
The dog is smart enough to clue you in. You are just too stupid do understand. Add a bit of water, maybe dice up a hardboiled egg or something small and healthy.
My Great Pyrenees has me even better trained...she would NEVER buy the imaginary meal, she needs some real hamburger on her dry food or forget it, she would sit and stare at me until I break...even if it was for days, she would NOT eat until I gave in. LOL!
Damn she has some nice milk bags.
You let that bowl sit there long enough eventually that dog will eat it.
😂😂😂😂
My dog would never fall for it. I swear she is human!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 This is hilarious though.
What did you add to the bowl?
Silly girl. Love the way she's s waiting for her gourmet food.
You pretend to add…oh I’m gonna have to try that lol.
So sweet❤❤❤
😂😂😂poor baby
My dog is the same way! LOL. ❤
you aren’t alone in this 😂
I have a cat who won’t eat unless she hears me pour it from the bag.  It is the sound she needs, not the freshness.  The other cat will eat anything as long as she also sees me put some water droplets on the crunchy cat food first.  Animals can be as picky as toddlers.
This food is made with love and care=the air, Made from the finest air around🖐😌
She’s the queen ❤ someday she’ll figure it out and you’re going to be in trouble mom😂
“Stupid dog”…Stewie Griffin
She is spoiled, but not by herself 😂😂
this is my dog/my life too!!!!!!
damn mine is the same
They love to be fussed over🥰
This is exactly how my Yorkie is with his treats. He wont take it unless i play the you dont want this treat game with him
What is more ridiculous the dog wanting or you complying
If food doesn't come with sound fx, food doesn't taste good :D
My dog does this ALL the time!! He will leave his food just chilling there for hours on end until I do something to the food. Now, I don't have to do all this though. All he needs is for me to pick it up, toss it around with my hands and then put it back and he's good😂
thata a dumb dog
😂😂😂😂
And thought my dog is spoiled
The 🐶 thinks you're a witch
Spoiled rotten😮
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 vraiment à pleurer ce que vous faites c'est vraiment prendre votre chien pour un débile housse avec votre chien le plus intelligent que vous Jacqueline conasse j'ai une bonne affaire enfermé comment dire Renault casse- tu pues et Marche à l'ombre
😂😂😂
She wants real food, not that processed garbage.
She probably watches her mommy cooking for the humans and wants to same treatment❤
Lol
Lmfao
Dry old food terrible ,gosh at least mix some wet food with it or gravy.
😊❤
It's the time and love that goes in to it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!
We had a miniature poodle the same way but would only eat out of a real human dinner plate we had to go to Walmart and buy him his own dishes lol 😂😂😂
Should have made her sit and wait for the go ahead. She was almost jumping and grabbing.
Our dog is ocd and he only weighs 10 lbs because he doesn't eat like normal dogs. He will go days without eating but he is healthy ❤
😆😆😆🎉🎉🎉🎉 oh that's a good one👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Just waiting for you to add the love.
Like I tell my wife. Yes honey I could make my own food but it tastes better when u make it with love
You should  see what her husband gets for dinner lol 😆
You're both beautiful!! Well done Mom!
Mama, she just wants you to cook it with love ❤😂
What a cutie!
dog realized that she did nothing with the food and tried to prank him but hes a good doggo so he doesnt show her how disapointed he is
Neurotic but cute!
That's how my dogs act too LOL
My dog is the same way. I can try to trick him. But he still knows
The dog behind watching her every move 😂😂
You won't be able to fool that dog very many times
OMG!! She behaves like my son’s dog!
🤣
...best dogs on the planet!
Our shepard brought the bowl out to you, and refused to eat until he had the same meal as the rest of the family.😅
lol my dog is the same way....lol
THAT!!!!  is so cruel.  hahahaha   and funny!
I thought I was the only one that did this.  My dog is the exact same way.  Wow. 😂😂😂😂
My cat has me trained, too 😹
put some meet there! poor thing
So! My dog won't eat until I put dining music on and play the maracas.
My dog does almost the same thing!!!😂
May I talk to a manager, mom? I asked for filet mignon.
Dog's are earth's Angels.
lol
This cracks me up simply because I have two dogs that have both me and my husband trained. It's hilarious.
Well no need for an iQ test to see what one has brains
Lady’s 46 dressing like a 17 year old
HILARIOUS
Looks like he don't want to eat the regular instant dog food but wants food prepared with effort, like humans. I do this for mine all the time, no problem. 😘
GSD with OCD 😂
I always say it's how you prepare it. With love makes it better.
How cute
Her sitting in the back patiently watching to make sure she’s doing it right😂😂😂😂
Husbands work the same way.
Keep on sucking up to the dog's whims. You'll get lots of likes here.
This dog is just here for entertainment purposes she knows you're not doing anything LOL she's actually just laughing at you
My dog is the same way. She also won’t eat unless we are all eating at the table.
If the dog wants to starve, when there is food right in front of it, it's it's own decision. Surely the dog will eventually eat.
Mayb you should get one of them platforms with words mayb he will just tell ya what he wants
our dogs the same.  wont eat until theres cheese on it. we can put a single slither of grated cheese on his dry mix and he wolfs down the lot.
Instead of this crap dry food ,give something real!
Stop it and actually cook her something 💔
Dog ist Just saying that I am Part of the Family and should be treated the same way
❤❤❤❤
Our sheperd did the same thing!
Reminds me of my government, except they get paid for it.
But i know she will protect you
Wow that's  unbelievable
It’s must be all women who don’t fill up the water bowl when they feed them. I get on my wife about it every time
We do what we gotta do 😂
Give her a surprise in that dry boring food. I grade up fried beef liver for my dogs and mix it with the dry and they think its Christmas.
It may be just dog food but now it's people food, congratulations your dog likes being part of the family. Who knew?
I love this!!!!
Crazy funny
I freaking love dogs
Omg🎉😂😂😂🎉😂🎉
😂😂😂❤❤😂❤😂❤❤😂😂😂
LOL
My cat won't eat his food till I stir it with my finger.
I tell my dogs eat what i put doen or just starve your choice
How cute ❤
Spoiled
I think this is adorable and funny they are truly man's best friend
😂🤣😍
Poor doggie common givem some steak
That is too cute
Shephards are very smart!!!!
My dog is allergic to storage mites witch come in all animal food snacks ect so i cook for my dog each meal it won't hurt to give her decent food w no bugs in It at least once a day go check out storage mites even when u put food in freezer it won't kill all the mites thing fur parents dnt know until u get a dog who is allergic to the scary things ❤
she s got you well trained
But why you lying though? lol
Man! Poor dog, thats not food, thats dry tasteless kibbles made from grain. Give her some meat she deserves it.
😂😂😂
Every dog needs a sous chef! Prep that shite til the cows come home and VOILA! Perfection in a bowl. Who's a good doggy? 🐶 🍲
Hilarious 😂 I just love dogs.
You might as well get her some toppings for her food , how would you like to eat the same food each day
If I ever tried this with my cat, she would pack her bags and leave within the next hour.
Hilarious 😊
Bless the food for her
😅😅
You are trained and she is spoiled rotten. ❤
If you love your dog do not feed them Dog food Feed them skin Less chicken  breast & and real meat
😂😂😂😂wow
Lo que quiere ese pobre animal es un poco de guiso o estofado que quede de sobra 😢
😂😂😂
She obviously did it before if the dog is used to it, I don’t know why you seem irritated by it
I love your dog! 🥰😄
This lady is a good pet to her doggy owner! Give her a bone! Very well trained! That dog was so patiently waiting to make sure the pet human did the tricks perfectly, then showed appreciation by chowing down!
Aww don't tease. Her😂
Awesome, this dog will never be poisoned.
How about putting something like meat in there
My dog does the exact same thing...  and you know who we have to blame!??  US!!  but is all worth it!!  I love my dog SOOO much Id do it again & Again!!
JUST THE SOUND OF THE PREPARATION CHOPPING  AND MIXING MAKES IT SEEM BETTER. EVEN I COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT.SOUNDS AMAZING.
She is adorable,and she loves your attention.
So cuteeee and beautiful❤❤❤❤❤
2 beautiful girls ♥️💯
😊😅😅😅😅
The Ranch thou Did U try It with The Ranch ??? 😂😂😂
Well tells dog food isn’t good anymore To that dog news are most dogs are getting human food lately
What was the liquid that you put in her bowl at first?
This is exactly what my parents pooch does. She’s super spoiled and pampered. She does get a mix of dog food and “human food”, but even when eating the dog food she has to have the whole show before she’s interested in it. My mom has a whole little routine just like this. 😆
Amazing how " THESE ANIMALS " are taking over . " IS MY DINNER HOT AND READY??? "
You better treat that fur baby like you do the rest of the family.  Next time, I need to see her seat at the table. Lol.
Mine is the same way 😂
😂😂😂
Our Remy used to wait for me to come back home before he ate his food!!  Your baby has his own rotund ❤❤❤
Dog is like, I’m sick of all these instant meals, please cook me a plate 😂😂😂😂😂
Make sure you put extra love and care into it 😂
Kibble is just survival food for dogs please add some fresh meat and veggies in there
I do that 2x a day fpr 4 dogs but i put a little water and a spoon full of canned food or choppwd carrots or a few corn flakes, some salmon oil etc. Always something lol
She will eat when she gets hungry.  Dog has trained up.  Shoukd be the other way
Absolutely hysterical!
Gorgeous female
Classy dog, with a big character.❤
Stone soup...
That is what is called conditioned conduct.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
If she was my dog, she would get chunks of steak with her food
Not spoiled at all 😂😂😂😂
😄  😄  😄
Dogs 🐶 are smarter than humans
I have to do the same thing to my Bishon.  He has me trained well.
This is a being who enjoys the finer things in life
I can’t 😂
Lol!! So cute ❤ one of pups was sick when he was little so he got “special” food service to hide the medication, he like this pup won’t eat unless I “jazz” his meal, he will be 4 this fall 😂❤ So precious, love the pups of the world ❤
It's not dinner unless Mom fix's it
Good mom , well trained
Haha its the same way with mu gernan shepherd lol😂 im like cmon bro eat ur food cause i gotta go to work
Here's the thing, the dog has watched you prepare meals before and knows after watching you eat said meals that that's how it should eat. So for the dog, if you don't prepare its meal the same way you prepare yours, it believes the food you offer it won't be edible.
Scam!
Those dried dead body parts cause Dogs anxieties anxiety attacks...an THEY ARE PHEW EXTREMELY hard to live through so PRWP.HER.GOOD GREEN BEANS FREW FROMMCRUWLTY GRAVY AN DHEL.BE.HAPPIWR HEALTHIER ROOT VEGETABLES.ROASTED AN PEAS ETC...
She needs REAL NOT KILLED FOODS...FREE FROM cruelty MEALS REAL MEALS...GOOD FOR Her NOT DEAD.bodies dried.
It just wanted you to add the love
We all know a trained dog will not eat until the signal is given.
You forgot the parsley garnish.
VIP SERVICE UP IN HERE!!😂
i love it1
My Cavapoo buddy is exactly the same!  By performing my ‘hard work’ making his meals, it helps me get through a meal without my audience!
My animals have me well trained too😂
Wow a half cup of food for a 100 lb dog
Just wants meals  prepared properly
Doggo demanded the special ingredient.   Which was love and devotion..   Which tastes sublime.
😂❤😂
Looks like a date with the modern woman today
Fellas, never date a woman with a dog.
This is on you for training your dog badly. You should be ashamed.
We have a Beagle, sweet, but stupid! But we still love him !😆
How I wish my dog was that easy! They say don't give in, the dog won't starve itself. Well, she didn't eat for 2 days and on the 3rd day, after missing yet another meal, her stomach started grumbling... LOUD! And she STILL refused her plain kibble. Needles to say, she's won the war. I'm too worried that she'd end up with serious gastric problems.
😂😂😂😂
Put some real beef on top of that dry please.
She could have fooled me, no wonder the dog is fooled
Stupid dog
That was hilarious!
Pets are like their owners. I’m betting you’re crazy too.
Poor thing! A couple of bites of delicacy, like a slice of ham, some apples or something like that makes my dog so happy
There's nothing on that piece of wood you just imagine she's imagining things LOL😂
😂
I’ve 2 Sphynxthat do the exact same thing. I even have to say, “are you sure you want this?” They’re ready! ❤❤
All you feed yoiur dog is kibble? worstndietnever
i had said gormet in my head then she said it im on the floor lol 😂😂😂😂😂
She wants her food cooked like you cook yours.  Ha ha ha, just too cute
This is just too cute.
Man imagine if instead of being a sarcastic asshole she actually gave her dog more than plain kibble. like eggs, raw meat, veggies etc…
Yea he want you to cater to him with that love baby
My dog does something similar.Very funny.
The dog is not ridiculous, the dog is standardising itself 🤣
Baby dog ❤❤❤❤
A chef for a gourmet dog!
No, the dog is just a freak who wants to see you jiggle as you do all those pretend enhancements! Ruff! Ruff!
She always wants to eat what u make for yourselves. But u trick her always.
Nah. You still did your dog wrong 😅
Someone obviously trained her to that not her fault
this dog trained you well LOL btw i dont wanna say it but i will this dog is showing deep disrespect to the owner but she will understand that in the long run
And here you can see perfectly how the dog trains the human....
Could you just add something instead of pretending to reward your best friend
Adorable. ❤❤❤❤
most companies do this to employees...
My dog is is the same
Lol
Teasing her . Shame on u. Lol U must have done that legit at some point in time. She's a cuttie
🤣🤗
I would have to pretend also if I ate that junk
Too funny!
Tried this with my chihuahua. She is gonna hold out for the chopped wiener and salsa 😂
Why did she train the dog to take food like that goof
She'll eat eventually 😂but she has done a great job training you😅
Tried that with mine, he looked at me like I’m stupid,  didn’t fall for it.
She's just brilliant!
Where's the LOVE?
Doggie wants to see some sweat and tears to go into making a meal or else it’s not special.
People food mama!
you have pavlov's dog
😂😂😂😂😂
Its about the process ❤😂
😂😂😂
Dog said, "Don't forget the splash of love on my food!" ❤
How about making her a special meal,at least once a week 😢. I'm sorry I could never do that to my dogs. You got to top them  off with   something on them kibbles.😮
🤣🤣🤣
You're pretty, also nice Alsatian
Okay, so hear me out! Imagine if you had no thumbs and some weird lanky alien fed you dry kibble every day for every meal. That's all you get to eat. Are you imagining that?  Dry. Kibble. Dogs deserve love.
That’s hilarious ❤❤
Omg. My dog does that!
Surprised this is a dog and not a cat!
When it gets to the bottom of its bowl and doesn't find anything but boring processed dry dog food, that lady is going to look like a juicy T bone steak to that dog. God forbid.
I actually do that for my 3 dogs they get something on their food every night
My Mom had a dog like that 😂
You have a doggo Michelín rating too?
I understand the process. I have that have the same expectation. So I add water when I have no other table food juices or gravy.
🤣🤣😂😂
She needed the asmr effects first
Nothing worse than a lying trickster 😐
My dogs will wait till I sprinkle a little cheese on their food.
If you love your dog so much, don't feed them anything you wouldn't eat.  Pet food is unregulated.  All of it is complete garbage.
U done spoiled her
Sometimes I have a cool idea but then I think Nahhhh then she'll expect it every time. 😂
No way😂😂😂😂😂😂hahahaaha❤
MAKE SURE THEY HAVE WATER
I want her she very intelligent ❤
My dog always eats after breakfast and when we are having dinner.  If some situation happens and we don't eat on time, the dog does not. Even if his plate is full.
Now that’s a dog that has tried some delicious Italian food.
😂😂😂
Feed her real food. Kibble will make her sick in the long run.
She was waiting for her mama's love to go into it! ❤
Humen are the same at costco or walmart with the sale price
Absolutely ridiculous 😂
My dog does this too
how would like to eat gravel each day and you could afford better meal.
Good human ❤
Made with love
I love it. Priceless
Dry kibble, I don't blame her
Dog sees you cooking food and sees you giving him food straight out a bag😂 he straight up said pft cook it B!£€¥😂😂
the canines are evolving 😂
Just like humans do
Kisses for the owner
😂😂❤
Oh ❤❤❤
We have a dog with funny eating routines as well.
I do this to my girl Kaos. 😂😂
That lick when the special sauce went on. 😂.  My dogs lick their lips like cats..then do ' Sup" before they have food, really wish i hadnt taught them that.. they do it when im eating my food.  🤨.  Then 'sup, sup, sup till i give them some.. 🤔
HILARIOUS. Shepherds are awesome…
Believe it or not I have to do almost the same thing for my dog.
This Is super cute ❤
It's just her training, she loves your food.
Do me a favor, switch your dog to the farmers dog dog food so you don’t look like an idiot!
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
So true!
Amen 🙏🏽
Really  !  Why can't you not faking but really do it...all it takes is some frozen carrots/peas and canned wild fish (one can last two days) or some white chicken. I have been really doing it for my 18 years old dog.😮
we have the same a33 hole dog.
He trained her well
Good dog
Ahhhh she to cute
I have one dog that sometimes will do the same thing won't use food if I just pulled in the bowl if I pretend I'm adding something else he's like yeah that's what I'm talking about😮😊
Precious 💞 she watches you cook
I’m sure one other person n me could be laughing about this now but it’s more of a joke for him but I’m sure he would find it funny also
I have a cat that waits for me to throw two or three bits of fresh food for him to eat.... Mind you the food don't be old😂😂😂
Thats funny! 😂😂😂
I do this all the time. To my dog and my wife doesn't believe me.I'm glad there's somebody else in this world
Special ingredients is that love and devotion without it it’s just kibble! ❤
Classical conditioning...aka Pavlov's dog
LOL, great one.
There's no water in the bowl? 🤔
Plot twist: dog knows it’s a ruse. Just wants to see how long hooman will pretend it’s real.
😂
Poor baby just wants a home cooked meal like the rest of her family... Lol 🤣
Classy dog😂
😂😂😂 too cute😂😂😂
Spoil the animal who's a creature of habit, then complain when its waiting for you to hold up your end of the bargain.  Great work clown.
My dog never falls for that she will look and smell her food and stare at me until I add the extra ingredients she loves or will not eat!
Put an extra scoop of love in there, Mom!!
Instead of mocking her, how about variety for her?
I love it ❤
he knows there is nothing extra, but likes that extra touch ....
I got two like that! Lol
😂
She's adorable....and she needs more fresh, cool water, please!
love her🐾
😂😂😂
My cat exactly!
I wouldn’t eat the dry food either.  I cooked for my dogs.
Your dog needs water
I put fish oil on my elder dog’s morning meal. He waits for it.
Yep my dog is the same
Dog said, Put some love on my food. I want some chopped herbs and olive oil too
My dog is the same !!😂😂 thats too funny.
😂
LOL😂
😂😂😂she wants veggies and gravy/sauce
Lol, mine does the same thing
😂Is adorable 🥰
wonderful
I’ve actually had to do something like this with one of our dogs, but ended up giving them canned chicken, green beans and sometimes sweet potato or pumpkin all together with a little kibble, and now she’s happy with the combo we’re doing!  This is funny! ❤
Thats hysterical ❤❤
Dog: mom i love you but, the quality of your cooking has really gone downhill lately. 3 stars
Lmao 🤣🤣🤣 that's so funny
I know that trick well
😂😂😂
I think it is a Shepard thing and it was trained for this so....😂
Love how the dogs in the background looking to see every step is done!
😂😂😂 ... ❤ It!!!
Yes she wants real food not dead kibble😢
My dogs got used to more time and effort and quality than the kibble my kids just dumped in the bowl and walked away.  They are worth it so I add extras luke shredded carrot or mashed sweet potato and they love it
Mix a little bit more please...
😂😂😂
Pavlov's Dog
Love this. My Dog is same way.
Dog has ASMR.
I love that dog.
snog
The power of placebo.
That’s too funny!!
I can relate to your struggle 🐕
Give her real food instead of dry food
Momma Love was the missing ingredient
Lol😅
🗣Well damn😂😂😂😂😂
kibble aint it
Lol😂😂😂😂
Oh yeah. You're trained.
I can’t Belive it ! You have to do what you do to her / his food so your dog will it his/her food
Looking like you the meal with them daisy dukes on🤪
Adorable
She likes to feel like your family does  , knowing you prepare meals for them .
OMG I thought only my dog acted like that
Shouldnt have spoiled it lol
Your dog is trying to convey to you that you are feeding her CRAP. She is hoping you'll actually give her some non-starchy vegetables, an egg or two, and some healthy fats,, instead of, or at least in addition to, that non-food you're currently feeding her,.   She's on her way to diabetes and bad hips. Congratulations.  _Dr. Pitcairn's Guide to Natural Health for Dogs & Cats, by Richard Pitcairn, D, V. M._
Try to cock a good meal for one day 😢
She is indicating to you she wants real food the way humans eat instead of processed waste.
Awh!   Made with love is always better
dog just wants a meal made with love
stacked
❤
The dog has her well trained 😂
She's a lost boy duh
Lol that is so hilarious 😂
You guys look beautiful together you make a great pair. That is really funny. She’s a part of the family you know just like we have salt and pepper on our food. She wants a little something something on her own. Maybe next time she’ll go crazy for that one, Have a wonderful evening
I got one like that too
See even the dog wants that fresh olive oil from the old country 😂
this is so sweet
Maybe it thinks you'll give a proper amount of food?
Like my dog…
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She’s watching in the back saying. Not to much sauce…
Love it. I have a cat like that.
She spoiled.. LoL..cute though
Next Level LOLOL!!!! Love it.
Dog - go on you know the drill
Funny as heck
I love this
I think that dog would love to play tea parties with children 😂
Haha.. adorable ❤🥰
You're lying to your dog.  Cut up a carrot or something....  ;)
My cat did the same thing. lol
Puppy OCD. 😍 🐶
Es Stupid
Talk about a placebo...lol
You did that dog dirty, you could have added a little something to it. You eat dry cereal for every meal.
thats hilarious!!  ;)
😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂funny how he feels so proud !  He is a family member.💋❤️‍🔥
thats what ya get it you teach this behaviour
Two points. 1st, the woman in this video looks like Soleil Moon Frye (the kid that played Punky Brewster on TV) 2nd, this woman ill bet is from New York.
My cat is the same way! 😂
If that dog is hungry enough, it'll eat! ...However, the problem ain't the dog, it's you!
The same as my dog i made mashed patatos 2day so i put some in my dogs bowl with real meat but theres one things i left out was the brown source she wanted and also my dog like her food flavoured because if it not she turns her nose away 😂😂😂😂
I had to do the same thing.  Pretend it was coming off my plate while I sit and act like I'm eating off that plate!!!
She wants that bit of love we add to food while cooking.
How many ppl Dont know that of you feed raw kibble your supposed yo hydrate it . Quick everybody . Run to your dog-food bag and read the directions and report back what you read. Thank me later 👌🏽 im baffled at how Many ppl that dont know this when its on every bag of dry ass kibble . I dint feed my digs dry processed food but of i did . Id atleast gibe him it the right way !
Nice chest
Obviously brought up on Dinner Theater.
My dog and cat both do this. I usually just run my fingers through the dry food and then they'll eat.
I refuse to eat something, that has no elbow grease in it !
Yeah the dog trained a human
Our pets are so lovely. My cat eats a little dry cat food then decides what wet food she likes. Points to one she wants. I try to get her to do Sheba at night. Like a treat because it’s more expensive. BUT WAIT FOR IT! She wants it on counter on her special plate. 🤷‍♀️🤣🤦‍♀️
This is the inequivalent to what the cafeteria ladies use to do to us in middle school. LOL
Ii can't stop laughing😂
She’s so spoiled!!😂❤
This is how my dog is too.  Sometimes I just add a tablespoon of milk. It works as long as something was added.  😆
You added the Magic!
😂😂😂 so cute
I love her so much! You’re a good mama!
Nice rack!
😂😂
Lil Bro is a dumbass but i absolutely adore this 😂😂
The dog knows what you do for your husband and wants the same.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s the love…thats what was on the cutting board. You could see it in her eyes.
Hilarious
Dog wants you to make sure that her meal is fixed right..ha ha ha ha! 😱😧😮‍💨😂🔥😎
😂😂😂😂😂
lmaoooo
🥰😆
To cute!
So cutee😂❤😂❤😂❤
You should give her something else but dry food as it’s not good for them
I go through this almost every meal.  I have a husky & a husky/shepherd mix..my husky Bella is exactly the epitome of this behavior!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol...😂❤ cute...she smells the seasoning
Wow.
I have a diva dog too
She was waiting to make sure that the food was trustworthy.She Trusts you.
And they say CATS train you. This dog can tell this girl to jump and she'd ask "how high?" xD I love it
So funny. We had a dog that wouldn’t eat his food unless we gave him 2 cups of it.  We tried just putting 1 cup and he would wait for the second cup. He knew. Lol
So adorable.
Never lie to your dog.
Surprised she eats that garbage at all
He is not ridiculous he's a smart boy!!
I love it!! My does the same LOL❤
Adding a little something nutritious to kibble. What a phenomenal idea. You should try it.
I love the dog's surveillance to make sure the meal is set up just right!
💗💗💗😅😅😅😅
She FANCY. 😂💗
The Last ingredient Was Love ....
More ridiculous: my dog insists I hand feed him.
Awe, my dog does the same thing. Can't blame them. Dog food looks pretty  blah
YEAH, WE SAW EVERYTHING AND THEY WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US..
That’s crazy
❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂 what a legend
That’s a good thing that means no one can confuse your dog to come with them and your posting this all over the internet
I never did before but I do believe I would go one step further.  I would actually prepare her something when I was preparing my own food.  The dry dog food is actually pretty terrible. Even if it is taking the dog food and adding to it.
Jajajaja jajajaja si son mis perros pero aveses Tengo que comerlo yo primero🥴😵‍💫😜🤪🐕🐕🐕🤣🤣
Your dog has YOU trained to waste your time. She knows actually what she is doing. Making a fool out of you.
YEAH,WELL YOU JUST WAIT TILL SOMEONE ATTACKS YOU,SHE'LL SHINE,PUT UP WITH HER
That's doing too much. It's a dog not a human. I'm not tricking any animal to eat as if it's some child. Eat or Starve dogs choice.
Too funny
You added love and attention!!
OMG my girl 🐈 Lauren does that same thing 😂🤭🤣😅😹.
❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂
😂😂 to cute
🤭😂🤣 Your dog has style you have to admit.
Why doesnt the dog have any water?
😅😅😅
She bougie 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Bad boy
Beautiful Dog❤❤❤
Love it!
MY DOG WAS THE  SAME WAY UNTIL I PUT A STOP TO THE SHENANIGANS!😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Too Cute mine are spoiled rotten like that too pretty Shepard
Brillant!  I am going to try this tonight.
It simply wants the same love everyone else gets,,,  U probably skip the steps, simply say something about how good the food is, the way you and or everyone else does.  Dogs aren't dumb, u really believe that dog doesn't know u aren't doing anything to the food????  It is part of ur pack , and wants to do what the pack does...
OMG !!!!! That's my pooch Sassy  !!!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍♥️
Don't feed your dog dry kibble, not if you actually want them to stick around for a good amount of time, trust me on that.
Those are such big bowls
I just absolutely love it smart-ass can be blessings to their baby❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish some people who feed their dogs (pets) eat this type a food at least twice a week, so they will understand how they feel about ! Poor thing 🐕
😂😂😂
😅😅😅😅😅😅
Pavlov Conditioning at work.   Dog has woman well-trained!
She is so cute and spoiled😊
Oh that's so much better mom. Thank you ❤❤❤
So she is the boss! Put the food down. She will eat it if she is actually hungry. Don’t bend to her whims. She will eat it once she sees y-u aren’t going to bend to her demands! I don’t kiss my bosses rear, I definitely am not kissing my dogs rear!
100%Relatable!!! That's brilliant (faking the steps!) ❤❤❤
She's too much 😂😂
Okay she wants wet dog food in there
😂😂
She is intensely watching every move. She makes right now.🤣🤣🤣 That dog is so beautiful, and precious!!
Oh she is so cute!! Have you considered adding any raw food into her diet?
GIVE YOUR DOG SOME HAM OR CHICKEN!!!
Poor dog ! Stop giving your dogs poison . If you can’t afford real food that humans can also consume and no die then you have no right owning a dog  Selfish a holes
Shit food
Try filling the water bowl and maybe your dog would eat.
Gotta add the love !
Wow! What a sweetie u r!
Thats not food. Thats processed dog feed
I am the same way.. 😅
She wanted you to add some TLC to her grub. lol
Lol,amen I'm not the only one 😅😂
Big boobys
OMG! You too!
so cute
I unintentionally trained my dog when i say " oops" or " uhoh" she comes running to check my feet😂
And guess what? You're not the only one 😂😂
Many mums go through this.. but he demands ur attention.. so smart
😂😂😂😂😂
leave the dog.  i bet it will eat.  you are not helping.  time to throw those shorts out and get a shirt that fits.
So cute! She wants what you have too.
Funniest thing i ever seen😅
Lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have to do the same thing. It's my fault.
HOLY MOMMMAA!!! 😎
Sorry if i sound ignorant, but I just would like to know why the red solo cup between the water & food? Please don't come for me, i am just curious😅
That is so adorable.  I have a female cat that watches me while im doing my skincare and/or putting on makeup. I then have to pretend to "glam her up" with her own set of clean brushes, no makeup or creams, obviously 😂❤❤
I didn't take in a single damn word.
My dog is the same way . I know it’s crazy
😂 my cat does the same thing
😂
Not ridiculous.   Spoil.  ❤❤
I absolutely love her! Awesome lady
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i legit got the cat version of the daughter from Signs.. my catt does this with water that has been sitting out for more than a few hours..  it's literally been out for like an hour before and he'll complain..  i will just pick up the bowl walk to the sink add a  splash of water.. basically he needs to hear the sink run.. and i put it down and he'll drink..
My cat does the same thing!
!😂😊😅😅😅
Stop fooling that baby. She wants gourmet. 😂
This is so lame the dog will eat when is hungry
l don't get it ? Anyway where's your restaurant ?
Muy bella acción para un angelito
The dog watching your theatrics in the background is the cherry on top! She is so serious!
I have a GSD dog, too. I have to feed him about four different foods, IN PERFECT ORDER, to get his majesty to evince any interest. He's a good companion and protector, so I humor him.
Food should not be dry when eating. Add some water or self pressed leafy green/fruit juice (not too much) to the food.
😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂😂❤❤❤
That’s not food. Stop poisoning your dog.
Feed your poor dog meat, she hates the kibble for a reason. She’s trying to tell you that .
Boil her some real chicken, fish, or pork with some potatoes and carrots, no salt. It's not good for animals to eat processed food for the rest of their lives. Would you? She's trying to give you a hint, but you're not getting it. 😂 Smart dog.
Aweee she is adorable and want mama to make her real food
Just too 😁 funny.
Omg thats hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂
That made me laugh out loud 🤣
Its not nice to deceive your dog like that.  How difficult would it be to cut up some chicken, or to tear up some cheese, and add it to the bowl?  They would SO appreciate it, and they are SO worth it!!!!!
My dog does this alot
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT........
Wow 😅😅😅😅
My dog does exactly the same 😂
Hilarious!😹
Lo9ks like she trsined you well!  I had a female cat like that!
Give that baby some real food. Imagine eating ramen noodles without the flavor packet every night.. thats her.
You should stir in gravy. . . 🥰❤️🐾
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥❤️
Thats adorable.
I did this with my cat, she eats now!!!! 🤣
She wants love added to her kibble, is that too much to ask for?
My cat is the same way lol
This pretend ‘ish would not fly with a durn cat. They study the heck out of you, up very close & personal. 😂 😂
I should try that with my husky🎉🎉❤❤😂😂
She wants for you to cook her food like you cook for your family!!!❤😊
Mean
If that is the behavior of the dog, as a guy, I'm double watching the parent. No no quadruple watching the mom.
😂
Great video! Thanks
Dog thinks she’s human too 😂😂😂
Yep, btdt
❤😂😂😂😂 This is hilarious! My dog's do the same thing. 😂😅😅😅😅😅❤
I wanna know how tf you figured this out. XD
Lol that's an awesome dog right there.
That is absolutely hilarious 😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
I want see more of momma
Very funny actually
Damn that's funny as hell ❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂
no,no,no, she wants you to say The Meal Blessing😅
Get rid of all canine health problems and live well past 15 years. Real meats and salmon and not every day same thing as humans. We are not built to eat every day
My sisters dog wont eat from the bowl she has to put it on the floor🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤣
Ha she’s like your gonna give me kibbles every day ridiculous got some for that
Moms doing what moms do best, feed the babies 😂
My German Shepard does the EXACT same thing!! Thats so funny I thought he was just being a spoiled brat  etc but idk now that I see yours does the VERY SAME thing lol 😂
😂😂😂😂
Precious
🤦‍♂️
❤❤❤❤
The dog is smarter than the owner.....lol......well trained.
😒 uh huh, sure… she swapped the bowls out in between cuts. probably added some gravy train or something to the kibble. 😂😅
I suggest you feed her The Farmers Dog food
Hahaa! I have to do The Same Exact thing for my Mini Yorki!
Lol 😆 🤣 😂 😹 ❤ 🕊 MuchLove N GodBless
She wants as good as mom & dad get ! 😊She feels special too. 😂😂😂
Brat❤❤❤
😅😂love the fake chopping😂😂❤cute doggie
My dog is the same. He just wants to be part of the family
Yup I gotta do the same for my blue nose 😂
poor thing, boring meal.  try adding a few chicken necks and something else thats tasty, an egg or a couple of sardines etc
What’s ridiculous is you don’t actually give her a ridiculous meal. She can’t make her own meal if she could I bet she would stuff chicken steak fajitas, burgers tacos anything in it but dry ass dog food
I used to think Shepherds were smart.
Maybe she just wanted some water in her bowl for the dry biscuits.
So sad,make it special
Nice puppies 😊
I need to do this !! My GS does the same damn thing 😂😂
She likes the finer things haha
I have to do it for Lola, as well. Such  characters.
That is flipping funny. I died laughing. Thanks for the laugh 😂
😂😂😂
Just a thought, instead of faking it, why don’t you actually put something good in her bowl like real food instead of making her eat unhealthy processed kibble day in and day out. Even a little bit of whole food can help her health.  Also, you should add water to dry food and let it soak for a few minutes before a feeding, else it can expand in her stomach and possibly cause gastric torsion. I know that’s not the point of this video, but why not actually do something for her special instead of pretending.
Lmao smart baby
Shes special🎉
Interesting, that Dog could be someone's wife. A wife that craps outside and waits for you to pick it up with a plastic bag.
Awe beautiful ❤❤❤ only the finest meal
My Twinkie...RIP...did the same thing to me 💯...GS DOGS ARE JUST LOVABLE ❣️❣️💋💪🏿❣️❣️
I love you and your dog!
Dog lick lips soon as she turns the green bottle over 😋 yeeeah now that's the stuff lol
Wow. 😂
😂😂😂
Bawhahahahahaha!
I wish I had someone like her to feed me! Daddy likes
😅😅😅😅
Gurl
So adorable 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼 patiently waits for special procedure 😂 she  believes in your gastronomie skills 👍🏻 I cook for my dachshund but just like your baby he demands foods coming off the table 🤣😅
You must of put dog meat in her food before.
She needs Mama the fuss over her our female German Shepherd is the same way a big old mama's baby
When my little pooch was around, some food would have to be faked adding, but if he smelled and tasted, wasnt rite wouldnt eat.  Had to add something real!!😂
😂😂😂❤
It's all about the service.
That's cool.  The dog wants to identify as her child.
🤣🤣
Start making her grass-fed beef and baby peas! No more kibble!
😂😂
dog is more precious than you
My chi wants to be hand fed
Cute
Give it some REAL food! Not that deadly kibble 😂
Nothing but the turth
put some real food in that bowl
Funniest thing ever!
thats hilarious! I had a dog once that wouldn't eat until the microwave dinged, my dog now won't eat until I announce Dinner is ready over the Alexa, they really think we are pack members and all do the same🤣🤣
This made me Laugh. Out. Loud. 😆
Hysterical 😂
Your little fur baby was waiting for you to put the love in the bowl.
That is so sweet. He wants mama's cookin!
Can you give her chicken broth in it once and awhile?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
😂
Trim that dogs nails !
My dogs dont like eating unless Im in the kitchen with them while they eat. Its a pack mentality thing. She sees you do that for the family so she thinks its suppose to be done for her as well.
No she has you were she wants you that’s all that is
He just wants to know you love him and that's by the effort you take to make his food yummy! 🐕🦮❤❤🐕‍🦺
You forgot the croutons and a splash of vinegar!
We had a cat that would just look at her food unless we stirred it with our fingers. Then she was ready.
What a good mother
Alright now missy I’m watching you so don’t try anything sneaky. 😂❤
My dogs the same. They think its special, just go with it.
NOW IF YOU JUST ADDED SOME VEGETABLES AND OTHER GOOD STUFF.
You should add some fresh  ingredients dogs have souls they are sensitive too  and want to be like humans ❤
So I’m not the only one, but my dog only go for it every now and then😂
Ummmm ... It's Not the dog's fault, Maaaaa.  😂😂😂😂  Smh....hoomans...🙋🏼‍♀️😁🤘🏻😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who's zooming who?
😂
Lmao ❤😂mamas special touch 🤣 😂 💕
Gourmet!!
I think I own that dog's sister....
Awe, what a monkey! 🐒
Come on give the dog some real meat 🍖 to eat!
lol.  What we do for our Animals to be happy 😊
Lol. The placebo effect
Placebo effect.
They're so cute and innocent ❤
Dry nasty kibble
🤣🤣🤣💯👍🏾
Leave it in the bowl. The thing will eat, I promise.   Dog has got you trained pretty good.
Yup, your German Shepard has you trained!
Okay so, you mean to tell me that, I could pretend to make my Ruby's special food, instead of what I always do, but without the eggs, half chicken, cupO' blueberries ,cupO' black beans and yogurt. Just pretend like I'm doing all that but use reggy dog kibble and totes behave like I really fixed her up a gourmet meal...interesting very much worth a try, but I'm thinking that she wont like it or eat it because I pretended or lied about her yummy meal and she get all weird on me, throw a fit, maybe ground me for such fakery. Ruby will know. ☒ I'm going to give it a try and I'll come back to report my findings...Appreciate this concept bc I'm set to switch out her meal routine for the summertime.. so the kibble will tide her ovr (if she goes for it) until June 6. Again, many thanks! I'll come back...good day2you!
😂
That breed of dog is called a Chow hound.
If you would've done that in the beginning like he said, you would've same both of you time! Quit cuttin corners!
the dog is saying,  I'll have what she's having"
I spoiled a pet too. My cat demands all his water be directly from the tap. It doesn’t matter how clean the dish is of if I filled it five minutes ago, he has to see me fill it up or he won’t touch it.
😂
Oh my gosh imma try that with my Yorkie when I give him my chicken I always have to chop it up but with dog food I just open and put it on his plate!!! So it must be all the chopping!! lol 😂
The dog is trying to teach an important lesson: “A little Love makes everything taste better.
I had a Deer Hound that would burry half his food daily in a hole he dug & would cover it up with dirt & leaves on his chain because we must keep one hound out by our garden to keep the deer out of it but then the deer fig out the hound couldn't reach them or chase them because of being on a chain not that deer knows hound is on a chain but the dog knows that & wouldbark & pull atvend of chain until my hound got smart & stopped pulling at first but still barked at them nut then he stopped barking to & just would watch them ! Deer would jump around & play out near & in the garden playing in front of him because the deer saw he couldn't or wasn't hona get after them any longer !
Hilarious!!!
As soon as she misses a couple meals, she'll eat. Missing a couple meals won't hurt her by the looks of things !
My Dad had a Deer Hound that wouldn't eat a bite of his feed each day unless you pet him up & then tell him to eat every day you must do that & he would stare at his bowl of feed same as this dog ! But got to run his ears & tell him its ok to eat!
My dog won't eat until I do. He's a severe social eater.
They like to watch us prepare their meal 😁 I just added water and stirred.
These babies got us under their paws
Wow that’s crazy lol
Loves the build up.
Are they all the same? They just want more attention!
Bwahaha!
But she’s a princess!❤😂
Not the brightest puppy in the kennel.
😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah my dog is the same way. 😅😊
I am surprised that it felt for the lie.  In general, dogs are more smarter than most humans.
😂
I'm sad for her
The dog has watched you cook for everyone else and isnt understanding shes a dog. Its cute and i love this
Whatever she did when preparing that dog's food when it was a puppy, stuck with it 😂
Did you always have him or did you get him later
My dog gets up on the chairs and wants me to feed him there, he taught himself that.  He is very smart
My wife will put the dog dish on the stove and pretend she cooked it for a second then he will eat it hahahahaha
Lol my dog wouldn't eat his food unless I made homemade gravy and put it in his food
She is beautiful ❤
Well, my guess would be that you taught your dog this way.
You get that from faking it for your husband so now you’re doing it to your dog
You shouldn’t do that to that poor puppy give her something special once in a while or him I’m sorry if I miss gendered that Baby just wants to be like his mama and eat special chopped up food a spoonful of olive oil and a quarter cup of hot water is all you need to do to really make them happy
maybe  you should give her better food
The dog wants real food not that hard crap.
LOL My Cat does EXACTLY the same thing!
All your fault...your training
Yes..yessssss. now its ready..😊
Just wait until she finds out...  think she'll come sh!t on your head when your asleep!
OMG thatss funny 😂😂😂😂
So funny
If I was dog, I wouldn't eat that dried xxxx either.
I really don't know what to say but I love her ❤️❤️❤️🇬🇧
She probably is sick of yukky dry food.
😂❤
Too cute
My dog won't eat unless I'm in the kitchen with him and he won't go outside any foot unless I go with him.
"Ridiculous" I think Not...Look at how hes got You Hopin Chopin for His Meal😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The dog knows nothing was added to the food he got a tremendous smeller.
Good mama❤
put some fruit and seasonings in that.
Now you gotta do that everyday
So much improved and yummy now. 🥳🤪👏🏻❣️🤍💜💚
gourmet? lol
😂💜🐶
There is a special ingredient going into it.  LOVE.
PRICELESS ❤❤❤
😂😂 my baby do the same thing 🤔
Too funny!
That’s bad. You’re mean 😂
Hilarious!!!
SWEETHEART 😊
Dogs are the best I love mine
Mine don’t eat until I seat down lol shepherds are special. Love my big boy.
why u not give ur dog better food?
My shepherd does the same thing. 😂
You should give the dog proper food. like what humans eat.
The extra shows you care ❤❤
Love it, she is the queen ❤
I have a Frenchie and pug who BOTH do the same thing!!! Crazy
So 🥺🥰🥰
My dog wouldn't eat his food without raw eggs & a little milk on it. A couple of times we ran out & he wouldn't eat until we went to the store & got it for him. Spioiled dogs. 😏🤷
That's why a man will always prevail
I love it!!!!😂❤😂❤ I too am a pet parent!
Woah momma! This hottie is stacked! 😍 Btw your dog is cute too..
Sounds like you train the dog to be that way smart dog keep up the good work, mama-i’m not sure that the dog is the one that’s ridiculous after being trained to do that😂
Sounds like you train the dog to be that way smart dog keep up the good work, mama
Got to love it. Dogs have personalities too.❤😂
LMBO 🤣  I have a Chow like that🤣
😂😂😂 She's worth it every  time she makes you do it.
I had a cat once that did the same thing
read up on Pavlov
I have a dog like that too!! He trained me well! 😅
Pavlovian response!
It's the LOVE that was added to it. LOVE is invisible, but the dog can taste the difference ❤
Ha ha ha ha ha😂
you need to cook it mum
Pruff... Women are masters of faking it...GRINS
😅😅😅😅
Why pretend chop, why not really chop something healthy into the unhealthy kibble?  How about some water packed no salt sardines for instance?  How about a medium-cooked egg?  How about some chopped parsley and cilantro?  I have so many recipes I could write a book about healthy doggie meals, those suggestions are just the easiest to get started with.
You created a monstah
Your being cruel and  pretentious to her, you must of done something for her to want this 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
So funny
Too funny😊
Just like mama makes it
😃😃😀😀😀😀😃😀😀😀😃😀🌹🌻🌹
Priceless and precious 💖
This is so funny!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Hahaha
She wants your personal touch ❤
tbh the second bowl looks so much more apetizing!!
Watch what I trained my dog to do.
Those puppies omg 😂
Love it!!!
Ur Dog 🐕  Is Watching  👀 U 😂😂😂😂
Oh those puppies
Odd
one of these days the dog is gonna catch on and it will be all over but the crying for you lol
lolol...she has you trained.  Don't worry.  My furbabies have me trained too.
😂 she playing you.. she knows what she doing lol
Is the routine she likes and the time it takes like when you prepare food for the humans. She trained you well  😂😂.
That's a riot our dog gets chicken and broth heated in microwave
I have a cat like this, you do know my feelings at 4 a.m.
Dog knows how shit and full of bad ingredients kibble is!!! Your dog is over weight! Why don’t you feed it real food/ meat !!!
that dog is so cute not ridiculous. this is magic. :D :D
Bully dog.
My dog doesn't think it's edible without cheese 😂
So.......these are supposed to be "smart" dogs, huh? 🙄
The worst food ever to feed your dog is KIBBLE
First time that I've seen a table at a comfortable height for a pet, that's a considerate owner.
How did it all start though 😅
Smart Dog!!!😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
oh how completely precious!! ♥ ♥
My cat makes me do the same thing!!😅 lol
Nah, the joke is on you! The dog is winding you up! lol
Imagine its 2am in the morning and you have to feed your dog and you have to do this?
You must be a very good chef
So sad😂😂😂
PEOPLE THAT FEED THERE DOG DRY FOOD DONT REALLY LOVE THERE DOGS ....
Say's the creator of the food monster 🤣🤣🤣🤣.  You both are awesome
Yup!!! Maltipoos as well. 😂😂😂
Lol spoiled!!
Maybe she's telling you to feed her better
😂
LOL   you must have done that previously.  now the dog expects it
This is hilarious, i have a couple of cats that are the same way :)
did anyone else notice there's no water in the water bowl?
😂😂😂😂
Woof
When aliens watch a dog walk a human and pick up its poop 💩 They know who's in charge
I am screaming 😂😂😂😂
That why there called German shepards
Spoiled rotten
When ur dog  been watching master chef😅
The dogs waiting for the command to eat.  The ladies just slightly torturing the dog to make a video
My dog is nuts too!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
It’s the dog watching carefully from afar! And you betta get it right! 😂 don’t miss or skip a step 😅
What is the red cup for?
How did you work out what to “pretend “ to do? Does hehe you put sauce on your food and thinks “yo! Look at her chomp that food up!” Lol
lol 😂
You're absolutely ridiculous that dog didn't come like that it does that because you said it human food mixed in with his dog food before and you've done it regularly and for an extended period of time and now it's spoiled and it can't stand to have to live off of dry kibble every meal for the rest of its life... you're a horrible person just mix it a little bit of something in there don't cut it off Cold Turkey hell you can take a piece of deli turkey one slice of thin shaved deli turkey, shred it up with a fork and mix it in there it wouldn't add any harmful calories to the dogs meal and it would be much happier for it... You're Garbage!!! And not because you're not giving your dog any real food but because you started this problem by giving it real food and then taking it away and now for internet clout you're talking s*** about your own best friend
She wanted you to do all the hard work 😓 what you doing for rest of the family 😂😂
Are you SURE you have a dog and not a cat in disguise?!  ;>)
. Dry processing dog food is really bad for them. Please give her good yummy chicken!! With veggies and a good quality supplements with all vitamins and nutrients.
Funny
I have to do the same😂 I scrape a bowl and act like I put something i😂n it
It's not nice to fool your best friend.
😂
Boojie ass dog
You both are so beautiful ❤❤❤❤🌹🌹
I have to add whipping creme 2 tablespoons to Rockford's food before he'll eat it. But this is really strange. You'd think Their sense of smell would give it away.
Thats a good buddy😅
🤣🤣🤣 My Frenchie won't start to eat until he gets a kiss, hug, and a rub from his daddy (me) 😂
The day she finds out you’ve been fooling her… 😂
She is a Beautiful Dog and Deserve it We don't have our Dogs for a Long Time.
Telling you no dog food real food like rice hundred percent pumpkin pure chicken chop meat carrots apples green beans fish coconut oil eggs all good for dogs
My dog will not eat dry food unless it's in snack ball.
Chefs do the same Thing to Humans in Fancy Restaurant to shut them up
Give her something better than dry processed kibble… she trying to tell you. She’s not the “ridiculous “ one here.
Too cute! She's a special little girl there and, as all girls, loves to be spoiled!❤❤❤
She has trained you well, she thinks it's hilarious watching you pretend with yourself. 😂❤
Funny! We have one like that! Lol
Who's train who
that dog had you looking ridiculous...
My German shepherd is the same way 😂
😂😂she pays attention this must be what you do to your food 😂😂
She's a beautiful animal
I love this super smart dog! She wants “special” meals like you prepare for the humans… bravo! And bless you for accommodating her! ❤
she should be yelp reviewer
Dogs really are so stupid
Fraud. Fraud is everywhere.
😂😊😊
🤣😂
😂😂
This so made my day XO
My kitten is this way 😂😂 but she knows when I add something or not.
The dogs ridiculous??? The owners are ridiculous. Thats how theyve obviously fed that dog at 1 time probably with himan food thrn wonder why the dog wont eat properly when they want to feed plain dog food
Beautiful dog.
She’s darling!😄
Learned behavior./
Why don't you actually make him a real meal? 💭
I have a cat that will not eat unless I'm right there. I mean he will meow so so much like he's starving but he won't till I'm sitting there. I think now it's because we all sit at the table the cats food is right near the table we eat dinner and I really now think since we don't eat till I'm at the table I have to sit there I just realized that's why 🤦🏻‍♀️
The dog wants the special ingredient when cooking for someone else....love
😂😂😂 adorable
Love it.....she knows you will do whatever it takes❤
She wants the same thing you make for you and your family. I don’t blame her! You can also add some peas or carrots, pumpkin or squash or sweet potatoes once in a while also
First we do this to our self 😂then we complain when we tired and just want to feed them but nope we started lol so now they have us so trained 😂😂❤❤
just stop doing that. the dog will eat when its hungry your training the dog that way
But that's how you most likely have him that's why he's like that so that's the way ????
It just shows that dogs are dumb
Her IQ is higher than IQ of her dog. How impressive.
Something tells me her husband gets about the same treatment.
She is ridiculous, but you love her 😅😅😅😅 you are ridiculous too 😂😂😂😂 We get ridiculous loving with these guys , I got two .
The dog just wants to be like hummans.
It's all about the presentation.
Top her food with bone broth, less work and she'll feel extra special. ❤
This is hilarious and so cute 🥰
Scamster mom. Poor dog
Lol! ❤
Dog said you gonna make my food just like you make yurs😂
Roflmao!!
More like the dog was told to wait prior to rolling the camera so this vid could get some views….. pathetic
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
crappy kibble , why don't you give it proper food,  dehydrated , freeze dried rubbish , it's carcinogenic too, vets agree on this , it's rubbish.
😂😂😂
Give her a little Fresh Pet on top of that, you’ll thank me later
Stupid dog
Nice pair
My dog does this too, she’s a labradoodle, so sassy 😂
Oh, she just wants to eat like you eat. She just wants to feel special because you’re special to her.❤ it’s not ridiculous. It’s special.
Hahaha im dying😂😂😂😂
Stush
She’s watching you like a hawk!😊
Very nice rack.
The Shepard has the human trained well!
She feels you’ve checked it out and it’s good for her
why dont you feed your beautiful dog real food instead of that processed garbage????
😂😂😂
My Female German Shepperd is  the same way.....  Women  not matter 2 or 4 legs   all the same  lol
I'm with the dog.... through some seasoning sauce and something sauteed in there
Wrong, puppers just wants you to add love to their meal. Exactly what you did.
All that effort to fool the dog - maybe use that energy to feed him something a little more than just dried kibble all the time.
😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤❤❤
😂😂
It's not about the food, it's about a loving touch 😊
Omg 😳 I have to do the same if it not prepared like a real meal chase won’t eat it
Spoiled pooch......😅
My cat is the same.  He'll happily eat his wet food but the dry food has to have a liquid treat on top before He'll eat it.
Kmsl. 😂😂😂Girl, sometimes you need a little something else. ❤
😂❤German Shepherds, been blessed with 3, all had their peccadillos, and told my husband, that's it, no more dogs smarter than me, ( miss them so). ❤
She wants the food delivered with love lol. That is too funny. Respect is due to a dog
Laws have mercy!😂😂😂
Put water in that dry food.
Lol😂 I love it 😂
This dog has you wrapped 😂
You taught her this. She has you trained. 😂😂😂
Cuties deserve this n more ❤
Gorgeous 😍
Amazing bobs
thus farse is . . . . ummmm. . .  nah a lack words
SHE WANT  to give her special  attention  to her food- carrots , broccoli  please
My dog was same, until I adopted the policy of either eat dog food or go without. It works.
or you just taught her a command to eat and did it off camera
Funny but I don't have time for that crap. I'm glad my dogs eat when I say eat lol
The fact that you do this to make your pup happy makes me know you are lovely ❤
Bougie dog 🐕.  Lol 💯 😆 😂 😁 🤣 😅
Actually  YOU"RE ridiculous.   Why give your dog shite, when you can give her a better meal that you could make for her..    DO BETTER
This trick might work on Gordon Ramsay. 😂
Dog saying you don't just pour yours out if a bag , it be seeing you chop onions and putting sauce on yours ...
Omg, you spoiled doggy, you! 😂
My dog is the same i have to pretend to be fighting her for it 1st...then she will eat it!! 😂
When you gaslight your dog so hard it backfires 😂😂
She’s a member of the family and she wants her food to be done the same as yours. She’s an extremely smart girl and works hard protecting the family. She deserves to be treated like a valued member of the family. Just saying
*Whats the significance of the red plastic cup on her food tray?*
SHEPHARDS ARE THEE BEST .♡. ❤️. ♡.
SHE'S ADORABLE. ♡❤️♡.  I GREW UP IN A HOUSE WHOLE OF GERMAN SHEPHARDS, THEY WERE ALL ADORABLE !♡!   ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE PUPPIES 🦮 🐕‍🦺  GERMAN  SHEPHARDS 😍
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
I love it and I think you’re great for doing that. My dog won’t eat unless he has his slice of cheese first lol. When I got him from the shelter, he was sick and required a lot of meds. So I’d wrap them in cheese. So now unless he gets his cheese, he’ll stand there just waiting for cheese, then he’ll eat. I’ve tried waiting. 10-15 minutes, he just stands there looking at his bowl. I get the cheese out and bam, he’s on it lol. It may be a bit aggravating to you, but I guarantee when he’s gone you’re gonna miss your little routine
Spoilt girl
Your a good mum for you are treating her darling dog like the rest of the family ❤❤❤❤
My dog does this lol
Buy her some toppers for dog food and give her a real meal.
😂😂She even sat there & watched until you finished cooking❣️
She is adorable ❤ she does not want just the  food - when you give attention to the bowl, for her it’s like your stirring your love into it. Thats what makes it yummy from mummy.
Just here for the mommy milkers
If I had that sweetheart I would actually put something special in her Bowl every time I wouldn't psych her out❤❤❤😂
My guy does the same thing. Refuse to eat. Then gobbles it up
Its ❤LOVE❤ honey 💕 thats the secret ingredient n she knows it 😊💖💯🥰
They are very Loving and to Smart. I Just Love Animals. So Beautiful your Shepherd is they are the Smartest dog ever. You are so lucky. ❤😢😂😅
My Bruzo was smarter than this he never believed till the time he saw real ingredients n few times made me re cook for him coz he dint like the food 😂
Sweet dog ❤
Yup... I always ask myself; "what have I done?"  My ABBBD (AM BULLDOG) IS SOO SPOILED AS WELL
😂🤣😅😂🤣😅
If you call ridiculous to you beautiful dog and make a video just trying to show us whatever your beautiful dog is doing (in your own idea) “wrong” then I tell you: you are the ridiculous here and you don’t even deserve the sweet being of 4 legs you have.
Cool picky dog love her❤❤❤
We used to do all that stuff,  even go as far as pretending to eat it so our dog would eat the food
Good dog
I cant tell which one is  dumber
so adorable... <3
😂😂😂
Kinda sad?
she just wants a little love
I have to shake my cats pellets every few hours for her to ear, she will escort me with sharp meows and a kind of herding😊
I thought my dog was soiled
You call that food? Just a bowl of dry food.  BFD
He just wants to eat what his mom eats
A stud would go ahead and eat. A female dog? This
what is it? m standard is so fussy and he stomach issues, so .. but he eats real home cooked food. imvegetarian but he is not.
Once they know you eat food that tastes like food, why should they eat dry chunks.....they're part of the pack. The pack shares the eats.
Awesome!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If something is made with love they'll eat it
That's wrong, poor baby
My GS only eats when we start to go out for bathroom at night🤣
Hey, at least your girl seems appreciative. Mine gets raw homemade food and sometimes turns up her nose at her bowl. So I toss in a few more blueberries. 😂
You spoiled him. My dog loves peanut butter and will look 👀 at you like is that for you without it.Lmao.
That dog is way to spoiled.
He’s a human that’s why
lol ❤😂
watched for the dog - stayed for the boobs (edit: anyone who takes this seriously needs to take a long nap and chill out...)
Same thing with my German shepherd,, I have to act like I want it too
I knew a dog that wouldn't eat his breakfast taco without a tortilla.  If you just put the filling in the bowl, he would look at the bowl and then you with the "where's my tortilla?" face.
😂😂😂😂
❤
Dog: if I keep encouraging her to cook, one day this will taste better. For now, I'll pretend it's good so she keeps trying.
You should feed that poor child better food. Sad he has to eat that nasty dry junk
❤😍🥰🤣
🤣🤣🤣❤
😂I’m sorry, but that’s a dumb dog
Any chef knows that presentation counts!
because the dog is use to you adding human food to her dog food.  Thats why . human food obviously taste better because all dogs like it better than dog food.
I so, sooooooo feel ya.
Lol
That dog wants a warm made home food❤😂
Feed you dog real food and not kibble. Do you want to eat crackers everyday
you put dog bowls on the kitchen? And some allow dogs on the beds. Yikes! Yes, I am a pet owner.  You love your pet doesn't mean you throw your common sense outside.
😂😂😂  So adorable, thats quite an affordable meal. My dog is similar. I trick her as I put some of my food in her bowl, and only THEN, she finally stops watching my food and gets to eat her 😂.
It's your own fault, now he just wants loven with his meal
adorable
The dog is like every one gets their's food cook can I have my cooked tooo please 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your pup is absolutely precious just love on that one as much as possible.   He is so good
🤣🤣🤣
Had two German Shepherd’s  Never saw this  Well.. anything to make our babies happy 👍😊😊
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Our cat wants my husband to stir his food with his hand!
Dogs are so smart… and so dumb at the same time.
Some people have trained dogs so well. That they forget animals have a mind of their own, and are smarter than most human. They even have common sense ot know that what you give them. Smells nothing like the smell that's coming from the kitchen.
Who cares
Our Pitbull does the same thing.
Spoil your baby. After all she'll love you and protect you with her life. What's a little chef prepared food from mom.
this works for my dogs...sometimes I do add fresh veggies and/or fruit to their kibble regularly; they love it
He is one gorgeous animal! If only my Rusty was here again, I would do anything for him! 😊😢
Best dog ever!!❤️❤️
Yeah. Dog said "Good hooman" LMBO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Well damn. That how do my husband
Smart mom, classic great mom
I had a dog that wouldnt eats until i pretended to cook itnon the stove
Can't fool my Bear like that😂he takes the kibble and throw it out of the bowl. Then looks at me.
My 2 shepherds do the same thing if i dont spoon a glob of their turkey stew canned dog food on top of their kibble. The look they give is like WTF Is this shit...wheres my stew dad...😂 now i dont gove them that treat for evening meal but mom does every morning. Spoild babies haha i love them!
QUEEN of SHEBA 👸🏼😂❤
EPIC. LUV  now if men could do ladies that
😂😂😂
Ridiculous??  You got to be kidding.   That's a smart dog.  She definitely would not eat from any stranger.   Good for her!  ❤
Why do you act like this was about feeding your dog when you know it was really about showing off your…ooh yeah right, right?
Um Literally A Boogie Bish 😂❤❤
All I gotta say is " hahaha".  So funny
That Shit is Funny
Awesome ❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂❤
Adorable❤❤❤
Sooooo funny!🥰❤️🐾
Nice
Hilarious 😆
That doggie has style!
Why don’t you eat it…  that food is boring
My GSD does the same thing 😅
The poor thing was probably hoping he has some real food instead of that kibble
u think you fooled the dog ? The dogs are much more clever than humans and thats a fact.
Stupid dog owners
Why are you feeding him hard nuggets of crap from a bag ?  That is garbage.  Dogs need FOOD.
Spoiled ❤
The glorification of terrible parenting. lol
Our family purchases the soft food from Aldi that are similar to Cesar.  We give one of those to each dog and also half a bag of the Moist and Tenders.  This is their dinner each night.  During the day they are allowed to have access to dry crunchy food.  They  have a doggie door to the backyard so they run around and are in good shape.
That shit is ridiculously funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
If a dog won’t settle for less why should we? 😂😂😂😂
Hilarious. You must have done this a couple of times and whatever was in there in addition to kibble made it taste awesome. Dogs are so great.💗
That's hilarious 😂
U win dog Mom of the Year award 🏆
I would prefer fresh meat.
So cute, funny 😂😂
Your dog would LOVE that EVOO on her food- try giving her some!
Prob. Learned that from Daddy
Mine too 😅
She watching too,like you better not skip or cut any corners on the preparation 😂
Forget the dog. I am in love with the woman.
Gordon Ramsey of dogs 🤣
What are you going to do when she finds out?
See that dog lick its chops when she started squirting that special sauce.
I love her
Mommy bad😮
I agree my dog is like that
my cats have funny reactions and habits with feeding them also
At the same time she's looking at you like THIS HUMAN IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.
I fell out omg
Lol
❤❤❤❤❤
thumbs down for a lame video
mine won't eat, unless, I stand in the kitchen and keep her company...
I want to meet this lady....
It's not that hard to make real food for your doggie friend.  Would you want that dry, stale crap?
Mom had to add more seasoning…this is hilarious😄😄😄
My dog does the same thing 😂😂😂😂
Still kind of sad she has to eat dog food.
😂😂😂
Haha that’s absolutely precious lol
Its important    savvy?
Now you get it Or you dont
😂😂😂awesome
I’m surprised that German Shepherd ate it.  And could not tell that nothing was put in his or her bowl.
Lol😂😂 so funny
😂😂😂😂
Awe
Cook her food?
Doggo: do u luv me? You: yes and here’s the proof for all the world to see. Me: good hooman!!
😂😂😂😂
When we would go camping. My wife would grill hotdogs for our dog. He would not eat it unless my wife cut it up for him. 🤷🏽
She wants some seasoning!!
You had to treater her with something before 👌🏾
I think there is research saying raised food bowls contribute to bloat in dogs
If she is a rescue  she may want chopped carrots or apples.  Mine does and gets it!
❤
My golden retriever won't eat until I pet him first and bring him to his bowl and give him a couple more pats on the head. The same ritual twice a day.
Worthless
This is too funny
😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you, Mama. GOD BLESS YOU.
So cute , got ritual going ❤😂
I thought I was the only person with a wacky shepherd.
Thos is so funny
😮😮 that's very odd cuz my dog would still know nothing was mixed in and would be staring at me
I go through the same routine with my dog.
Dogs are amazing
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
She back there grinnin ‘ 😂🙌🏻🤣
Dog wanted a show, not dinner lol
That's hilarious
So smart❤
Woke average person: Dogs has same inteligence than humans: Dogs:
Hahaha God bless. Dogs know, and my dalmatian does exactly the same thing
😂😅lol
Your dog is telling you he or she I don't know what your dog is male female whatever The point is. You're a dog wants  better food good food He's  tired of that dry boring s*** That's what your dog is telling you so do it you love your dog do it give him some damn better food people do it all the time what's wrong with you you better hope he don't  bite your ass while you sleeping cuz you didn't want to give him better food just saying cute dog.😁👏💖👍💃🇺🇲🫡🍺🍺
Too funny
She lied to him
The onions were not sauteed long enough. The dog is not amused. The audacity of da hoomin!
She wants the love added :D
She thought she was fooling dog but dog makes her do that all the time, dog knows the she is Well trained 😂
Why not feed her some real food then? 😢
Roxy is that you😂
placebo effect 😂
I dig it!!
Gourmet sound effects! Love it!
Ahhhhhahaha!! I’m trying this with my baby today!!
I think you could have a added a few little morsels of something for Christmas sake.
It’s all about making them think they’re getting what you’re eating
OMG.. I love it!! You're a very good Mama.. 😊❤
Precious 💞
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
🙄🤦‍♀️🥰😂
The Way you get em, you have to continue in order to keep em.." Yup, down to the dog!"😂
My dogs exactly 😂😂😂 even looks like your dog!!
Just give it the sauce it likes.
My dog is the same!!!😂
That's because it was missing the main ingredient: your Loving intention
😂😂😂
stop feeding it trash then lmao animals like a steak once in a while too ya know lol
My cat was the same way!!  Crazy isn't it
Look in the mirror...woman. And judge yourself...not the dog.
The dog is truly monitoring her every move. 😂
And I thought my dog that won't eat unless there is ranch dressing on it was the only one lmao. Omg I love it
Look at what you started lol
Laughing out loud she just want you to do the same that you do for your family
You know what my dog is the same way and I noticed if I move the bowl and pretend like I’m adding fresh food in it or cooking something he would eat it. I thought it was just my imagination lol
Totally unbelievable
Do what you’ve programmed her into learning. Thats what up here.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chef Ramsey would be impressed so funny😂😂😂😂😂
So cute…but just want to let you know that I had to find out the hard way that bowl contributed to my baby’s hip and arthritis. Ask your vet. It made me so sad and I can telll how much you love her ❤❤❤
Come on give the dog some real food.
Raw food is whats shes waiting on I think
That's crazy 😧
lol
She actually will eat. Be the human not the pet
Can you say,  " SPOILED " ?                     👍😉
LOL, maybe I'll try that with my dogs!!!❤😊
Hilarious
I didn’t know Daisy Duke had a German shepherd
My dog is exactly the same way🙄
We are the "staff" for our pets! 🤷
The dog is not stupid, it’s trying to ask for different food!
Ahhhhhh❤❤❤..i love dogs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
This made me cackle 🤣🤣
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Maybe hoping each time the food might taste a little different- imagine eating the same thing every day
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
One of my furbabies WILL NOT eat until you pet her and say Eat Girl!!!! Love your Furbaby
She likes to think her food is being prepared and not poured from a bag😂
She is special, not ridiculous
Maybe I other place they prepared something good to her or he everything are in the mind
You did not put anything in it !! 😂
Spoiled ❤😢
Lol
She just wanted some extra love added
OCD doggy.
You have some nice Racks
I have two cats that will not eat their dry food till I put a little special sauce on it AKA spring  water
How funny😅
😂😂😂 I love this.
😅🥰
I had to do the same thing with my Jack Russell. She passed on and I can't stop crying my dog
Delicious 😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are a genius 👏
Beautiful dog
I'm thinking if you let it sit there for a few days... she will eat! Lol
She said she wanted it seasoned and she meant it 😂
Is that strawberries or raspberries in the water
whos looking at the hot lady
This is all about visual cues and repeat patterns, lol
“prep my meals like you do your meals.”   -dog
Haha. My dog is the same
He'd starve in my house.
I let my dogs own stomach do the convincing. I don't go through that rigmarole. If he wants to eat, he eats. If he doesn't want to eat, he starves. PERIOD!
My Czechoslovakian Shepherd tried do the same thing. That same food sat there for two days. It’s finally ate after two days and a half. Lol.
Lol they watch everything she thinks u doing that every x bc shecwatched u cook...I got a Mali and they stare and remember...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Same.  I now have to put a little water on his food for “gravy”. He’s a shepherd mix
Put some effort into your best friend, lady! Dry food is deficient in a lot of nutrients. I put an egg from a backyard chicken, left over cat wet food, salmon oil, rince water from fresh wet cat food cans, and warm water in my GSD's and husky's dry food every night. It takes 1-2 minutes.
👏👏👏😂😂😂✌️
She was waiting for you to put some love into it
❤❤❤❤❤
I always put a little left over food with the dog food for taste variety. I feel sorry for animals that always eat the same food.
Damn your dog is dumb! Hahaha
I cook for my boys and they appreciate it
Omg to funny😅😅
HILARIOUS 🤣 🤣🤣💞
Just a spoiled dog I guess!! Power of suggestion works!
How boring and tasteless is just her kibble! Mix it with some wet food! She probably remembers eating like that in a previous life.
My Diesel know the difference😂😂😂wish i could trick him like that
😂😅😅
My golden has a raised food and water dish.  She suddenly decided she wasn’t going to eat her food out of the raised dish. At first she wouldn’t eat unless I hand fed her now it just has to be on a paper plate in front of her food dish 🤷🏼‍♀️
That dog deserves better than to be punked
Sad. Pup's not ridiculous. I'd try to get my owner to give me something fresh too! Who wants to eat the same pellets day after day. 😞
I hate dogs
The things we do for our fur babies
What’s amazing are mangos 👀
OH YEAH ,I KNOW ,RIGHT?
What a rack!!!!
🤣🤣🤣
What dog bowl?
She was waiting for that special ingredient...LOVE! ❤❤❤
I Love It!  😂
My parents dog gets fooled exactly in the same way 😂😂
I luv this video. Thanks for sharing...🐾♥️☺️
Yes but who taught her that?   😅 Mom did! 😆
Ohhh she wants you to PREPARE it for her 🤣🤣🤣🥰
got to try that
How can you not love dogs.  They are awesome.
😅
She knows that whatever special ingredients you add to her food is seasoned with Love.
🤣🤣🤣
magic ！he needs the magic things adding to his food 😂
More like you've given them so much human food that they can't eat it without it.
🤔😂Spoiled baby!🥰❤️
How funny!! 😊
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love your dog!
That's hilarious!  My cat does that too, go figure.  I love them xxxooo
Lol
The main ingredient is always love!!!  She’s waiting for the extra love you put in it for her!!!  Everything tastes better with a little extra love added in, my grandma taught me that!!!  Miss her & now thanks to your girl, I see how right she was!!!!  💝
Omgosh You mean mine isn't the Only one!!😅😂 It's SUCH a process! ❤😂
Your dog is just boogie that’s what it is lol my doodle is boogie too.
My grandma 3 German shepherds she had to spoon feed the, and they use to starve f ing with me 🤷
Are we going talk about the red cup
He was supervising to make sure you did it right too! Lol
she doesn't care what the food is she just knows when you put love in to it and when you just throw something in a bowl and let it slam like it isn't special, just cause there not human doesn't mean that there not intuitive like us!
Our dog saw the whole family eat at the table, so she won't eat until we put her on another chair too. So now she joins us at our table every day. 😂
Mine does exactly the same, just sits there and watches me with a slightly reproaching look, in front of the fridge. But I am so dum to get some meat cut it in small pieces and mix it into his food, which he then eats happily.  I am going to try this trick if I am strong enough 😢
😂thanks Mom
I used to put a tin of sardines on top. Your method is so much more economical!!
My cat does the same thing !
My wife does that but actually puts extra in it 😂
The red cup on the food tray?
He just wants the same way as how u prepare your meals.
Lol
And hurry up !!!
😅, what does she think is being added?
Dog on that sprinkle sprinkle life!🤣🤣🤣 "If you ain't wining and dining me I don't want it"
I had a lab that did this!  I had  to sit her bowl on the stove & stir it, then tap the bowl with a spoon. That tapping sent her over the edge and her mouth started watering! LOL
Well sometimes i do this to my husband and he happily eats ready cooked meal 😂
What you feed her is ridiculous. Those commercial foods will ultimately make her sick. The ritual is adorable. Her silent demand for ‘better’ is well founded.
😂😂😂
Too cute!! 😂😂😅 I have to turn my microwave on to make mine think it's been cooked 😅
What a stinker 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂dogs definitely have their own personalities
The dog isn't the one who is absolutely ridiculous.
You gotta put the love in it
Mine did the same thing.
Oh Lord my german will steal stuff right in front of me if she feels Im not paying enough attention to her. Last night it was a jar of arthritis cream she even took off with it and I had to corner her to get it back. Shes a huge brat but I love the hell out of her ❤
Why not just give her some good eggs or some meatballs or something
I bet he's a male dog! Hahhaaa
Beautiful - 😂😂And yes some animals have weird corks like
Beautiful, the German Shepard too.
Good.fun.video.madam.🎉🎉🎉
Come on, mum, a bit of chicken wouldn't go a stray.
That's my DutchESS,but she wants to taste something added!!
Everyone else in the family gets there food prepared she wants the same treatment.
She knows what she likes
🤔🤦🏾🤷🏾🙍🏾☠️☠️☠️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Give it some real food. That dry junk has no nutritional value,
Your  tee shirt and Hoochie mama shorts are ridiculous. Get to the video.
😂👍 I know a little about that myself
😂😂😂😂😂
Damn u look good
Looks like you did that lol
What’s her @ ?
Hilarious
Got a big kick out of this.
German Shepherds are very smart . Someone got this dog into this bad habit by putting things into her food before she ate. So now the dog expects it every time.
You spoiled him that’s why. That’s a German Shepard Alpha Dog. He’s sitting there watching to see if you fix it right lmaoo
u feed him too much human food so hes use to it
Such a beautiful girl. Just wanted her dinner prepared with love
😁😁😁 how adorable!  (Did the same to my date 🤣🤣 )
😂 I'm dealing with a 10 wk old kitten who acts the SAME EXACT WAY 😂 The POWER of THE MIND
😂😂
❤❤❤
My mother’s cat wouldn’t eat her egg flip unless she saw mum mix it with her index finger. No other finger or spoon.
Love it
Yes, they are little tyrants! Mine won't even touch her plate until I cut it up to smaller bite size & hand feed her the first bite. I have done everything books & vets suggested, it doesn't matter how much she might be starving, she wants what she wants. I am well trained now!😂
😅😅😅😅😅😅
도끄는 이일을 영원히 기억할것이다
😂😂😂
Been there done that
OMG my Bichon is the same way . I put the bowl in the microwave, take it back out, wave the parmesan over the top and dinner is served.
I know what you mean, I have a bully pit that’s the same way,
She's beautiful.. the lady I meant
HeHeee ... my son is about to turn 27, and i still "sprinkle" extra love on his food when I make it. Even better, when he leaves the house, I kiss the palm of his hand and he puts it in his pocket, just like we did when I took him to elementary school 😅
Where was the meat?
She trained you well 😂
Funny dog!
That special ingredient. Love
somebody gives her treats...
Adorable
😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Boy she has you well trained! Good puppy!
Gorgeous
That's funny cute.😅
So sweet!
My dog do the same thing
ଏ କଣ କଲେ ଆପଣ ? କୁକୁର ଟି କୁ ବୁଦ୍ଦୁ ବନାଇଦେଲେ 😂 । ଆପଣଙ୍କର ବୁଦ୍ଧି କୁ ମାନିବାକୁ ପଡିବ 😅
Do you remember when you were a child while your mother made cookies, how you’d sit at the table waiting for her to put the plate of warm cookies on the table? And how you always thought her cookies were the best cookies in the world? Do you remember what you always said when she asked you if they were any good? Well, it seems to me that this furry dog would say the exact same thing. You said they were the best cookies ever because she put her love in them. This beautiful dog won’t eat unless her mother puts her love in the food!
I hope one of the ingredients in that dry dog food isn’t corn, or else your dog is going to have health problems when he gets older.
My daughter’s silly dog will not eat a bite until he can eat the first bite of food from off my hand…salt additive,lol.
I love this dog ❤
PaaAAAaaappy❤❤❤❤❤❤
She s faking it ... this is not cooking!
They have us well trained
😂😂
That is hysterical😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
It wants human food
She was like you not giving me know bland food, put some spices on my meal….
🤣😆😂
So cute lmao
He has standards
Oh my god, that is crazy ass, expensive olive oil you’re giving your dog! 😮
That's so cute... Lol
Really cute...lol❤❤😂😂😂
This reminds me of marriage…….. I’m the Shep…..
Why would you give her brown nuggets every day. Give her some real food like raw.  Look it up.  😊
This dog wants real food
Lmaoooooo how did you even know to do that. That’s hilarious
Basically all this video explains is that dog is overspoiled. 😂
We have German Shepherds the crazy like a fox.😂
My cat is a lot like your dog.
That’s hilarious!
dogga just wanna be treated as equal tf you mean
Who is she..
Love it...
OMG I need to do that. My dogs have gotten used to me adding something like pumpkin, green beans or yogurt and now they won’t eat without it. 😂
Who is training Who😂😂😂😂😂
She's wonderful
She's so funny
My girl is picky about her food to smh
Is it only me or is it the most laziest way to feed your dog. Just open the packet and throw it in a bowl? I add finely chopped boiled eggs and 20gms of meat. Very affordable and healthy for a family member.
Too cute
What! Big ass dog like that n she gets 1/4 of a bowl.  Cmon jow
I'll never understand why people feed dry food to their dogs. Add a sardine or a boiled eggs at least. Yuck.
We had a dog who would take his food out of his bowl one mouthful at a time, and line it up on the floor/rug. Then he’d eat each little pile one by one. He did this with every meal.
She needed moms special ingredient, love 🥰
🤣 tricking their ding don't brains IA hilarious 😂! I pretend I'm eating their food! Then they eat 😒 😊
That's so cool 😊
*barks*
That's so funny. My baby want drink his water unless he watches me get it from the tap. He wants drink nothing at all unless we give it y to op
She wants human food .
That dog has you perfectly schooled.  She wants that love you add at the end of the meal prep.  You are a spectatcular owner.  Never change & never part with her.  You love will come back to you tenfold from her.
Well I mean you spoiled her 😅
I’m not doing this Everytime I feed her😂
That’s love and attention required before every meal.
😆😅🤣😂
Same here
Stop playing with your dog and actually cook her a meal.
Pavlov would be proud of you.
Efecto placebo
Lol. I love it  Your a good mom
I put my dogs food bowl on the stove and make a fake sizzle sound. Works every time
That dog has got her trained so well.
Well trained human.  I'd do the same for my dog.
A lil bit of chicken and veggies wouldn’t hurt . Would you eat that crap ?
most women are this way
My husky mix is the exact same way 😂 I usually stick his bowl in the oven (its obviously off) and sprinkle "seasonings" on it lol. Cracks me up every time, but if it gets him to eat? Yeah I can manage that. :) the goodest fancy boyo.
She has 2 round reasons why I liked this video😂
😂😂😂😂
Where is the water ?
Cheating 😢
How many times did you get drunk or high for that to become the routine? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 it’s a joke everyone please don’t come at me.
I have a dog just like that!
I do the same 😊
How do used to do this to my daughter and then one day she just grab my food out of my hand… the end
That my friends is the placebo effect.
Same as mine,she won't eat her roll unless I cut it up
😂😂😂😂
Good momma lol 🫶🏽
What a cutie.
Such a girly hehe
Lol mine, too. I have to pasd it under her nose like a wine cork, and sometimes pretend to salt it
My dogs were like that, too.  They wanted a 'prepared' meal.... only I actually did it.
It wouldn’t hurt to actually give her some fresh blueberries or bananas in her kibbles?  Haha
Give her some real food…kibble is crap! She deserves it!
you could put in the bowl blue berries carrots and a little chicken broth that looks dry
She got Tig bittys
YOUR THE FOOL FOR EVEN DOING THIS CRAP.... HE JUST WONT EAT
❤
That food is boring add some wet food.
I do that every morning but I actually add things into it.😢
I have to pretend to eat my Morkie's food.
Here i thought you were gonna add bone broth to it. Not imagination. She must like table scraps too.
My dog does the same and my best friends calls it the Gordon😂 Ramsey
Is that olive oil being drizzled over the dog food ?
Put some real love in that food😢
Make her chicken and rice with veggies over her dry food would you eat boring dry food everyday
2 different videos stop deceiving yourself
Lol
Don't let Kristi Noem dogsit, she'd just sh**t the poor thing for its "quirkiness" 🤦🏼‍♀️💔
Weren't you the one that taught her n now you're saying it's ridiculous
I love this so freaking much!! 😂
Soooo cute, she was waiting for the love you put into it! LOL
Thats funny😂😂
Who started that? MOM. Now you reap what you sow
My cat is the same way...😅
Spoiled rotten Baby❤
The dog has trained you well.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😎🔥🔥🔥
Our sweet dog is the same way
Stop encouraging mental disorder
Lol aww so adorable
Sooo funnnny!!
That's hilarious!
No way id do this.

Just proves how well they can smell. No one knew they could smell the Imagination.
Had a cat that would not eat until you poured more  food into the bowl although there was food there
He is like hell yeah she hooking it up.
😂 I have a female yorkie who does the same thing.
😂😂😂
I don’t understand how dog owners feed their dogs, this dry ugly ass, cancerous food
🤣🤣🤣
She is awesome…. Knows you chop up aromatics on that board!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Mine won't eat until I grate parmesean over the top.
My Shepherd was the same way. I had water and ice cubes other side. She lived a long good life. Looked the same as yours. A rottie too. 209 lb+ so sweet aqand protective.
Ha ha this dog is awesome ❤😂😂😂
She said she wants some seasonings on her food😂😂
The sound tregers the German shepherd into thinking more of the meal.
That's F up 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have a male Rottie and he does the same thing. Spoiled AF. 😂 Beef broth and green beans are his go to. Egg on top for breakfast.
Dam my dog does the same thing has to have an scrambled egg every nite
Mommas hot
Too Funny
What dog?  I only saw a beautiful woman
I stopped feeding my huskies just plain dog food and started adding turkey meat and blueberries and other stuff to it and its changed them alot. No more bad back legs, more energy etc.
🤣🤣🤣😂😅😎👌
Precious
I absolutely love that dog
That was too funny!🤭
Keep entertaining that BS 😂 Dog wont starved
Spoiled
You evil …. 😂😂
Special meal fr
🤣😅😂👋
😂
I absolutely love this!
Thats hilarious 😂😂
Watching her owner like a warden. Ear twitching for the right sound of the magic ingredient mixed in. 😅
So adorable ❤
Like my dogs they’ll kick there dish around there like lil kids.
OMG!!!  i absolutely LOVE YOU for hysterically seeing to all of your babies needs!
bullshit this "owner" should never be allowed  to have dogs again.. The dogs are trained but in the wrong way.
Goddamn your one sexy mama
Nah my dog would know immediately, she doesn't play games with the chicken I put in her bowl. She'll know.
That's funny . clearly you're a dog lover like myself . Awesome stuff .keep having fun with her she's beautiful.
Perception can become reality
It’s called being spoiled. Unfortunately, EVERYTHING in modern society is freaking entitled.
😂😂😂😂
❤
Hilarious....mom this is what makes my dinner SPECIAL. I think it's so sweet.❤
I feed my dog fresh meat everyday- She Never Ever complains !! TRUE 👍
Talk about spoiled rotten 😒 😮😅
Stop feeding your dog SHIT . Give it some meat ffs
Now I'm ready
Spoiled little girl but she is gorgeous. ❤🐶❤
I LMAO. I used to have a high-maintenance dog, too. She only got that way after I had my daughter. She wanted some attention. Funny as hell 😂❤
Oh..... my....... God! I'm gonna try this
😅🥰❤️👍
Diva
That's funny..great idea
Why's there a red cup
😂😂😂I love it, laughed so much! What a cutie❤
My cat is on the plate watchers diet if i dont watch her eat she wont do it sometimes
U r wrong let someone do you that way
I have to do that to my cat.  He is absolutely stuck up!! He will have food in his bowl and he will be hungry BUT he will not eat UNLESS he SEES me literally get the food from the bag and put it in his bowl. He doesn't like to eat the unfinished dry cat food that has just been sitting there in his bowl.
Why don’t you cook some chicken or steak and vegetables with it for her. That’s sad you only feed dry. 😢
Nah. She knows 😂
Just had to add some love... Mine did this as well when he was younger
I always add to the kibble... an egg and some liver and peas and carrots... my girls love it
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cook mummy ❤
Its all about Love
My dog like that sometimes really wierd
This dog is absolutely beautiful...😂❤😊😊
🥰  Made with love  that thinks your dog.❤
Aww 🥰 she reminds me my dog 🐕
That's not food. It's toxic crap. Kibble is the worst thing you can feed a dog.
Dogs are training humans now lol
OK, thanks for making me laugh!
This is my dog lol.
waiting on MAMAs T.L.C XOXOXO
Could be my dog, semes Sheppards have that in common.🤣
Ooh! That dog's got psychological issues, lol!!!
YOU BETTER NEVER GO VISIT SOMEONE FOR MORE THAN A A COUPLE OF HOURS
Yup we have to do this for our dog
lol 😂she hates kibbles so she  makes you go through the process of making a real meal…try feeding her real nutritious food she won’t put you through this ❤❤❤
I can related...my dog will wait for me to pat him on the head and tell him to go ahead and eat. Manners are everything 😅
It's a little hard to deny what we will do for our companies.
Omg this is like my dog i have to add his wet ontop if his freshpet , then add a bit of water to make a sauce , then he needs a tasting to approve 😂
🫢🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think your cow is broken.
A stupid dog
Thank you for pampering her❤️❤️❤️
My German Shepard is the same way spoiled
“This dog is absolutely ridiculous “😂😂😂😂
I'm smiling by just watching this 💕💖
Should add carrots, Brockley, blueberries, fresh beans and hot water. They like their food warm and also soft food is better for them. Kibble is good as a treat for their teeth at end of the day.
So adorable she want to eat like Mama.  ❤
This is a little than what we're talking about? I think we should investigate the dog Food industry.. ive heard alot of dog food is  very bad for them an they have a short Life span ? Anyone knows this an suggestions ??? ♥️✌️👍💞🐕🦮🐕‍🦺🐈These animals deserve better plz help ??
i love that doggie.
😂😂
I like the microwave beeping to signal dinner is served. Lol
I'm not doing all that bullshit 1st......leave the food out. If it doesn't eat it starves....it'll eat
I want what you having 😂😂🥰
Lol😂 you have spoiled her, and she's adorable.
Imagine having to eat that 4% meat crap every single day.
Imagine having to eat that 4% meat crap every single day.
Aww God love it!🤟🐕‍🦺💯
I make mine chicken and rice.  Shell pick out all the chicken then eat the rice.
Haha~ all it took was that extra special culinary "touch".
It tastes better with pretend ingredients.😂
😅😅
I Love it!! 😂❤
My cat does the same thing lol😂
😂❤
She wanted a pinch of love added to it.
Are you the second owner? Maybe the first cooked her food and chopped, sliced stuff for him.
It’s called conditioned response. At some point you were doing that and the dog watched and listened…..when you stopped  or took shortcuts the dog believed something was missing.
That’s funny!😂 Beautiful dog.💕
My dogs eat home made "Farmers Dog" and they love it, one is growing back her fur and the other isn't throwing up anymore...stay away from commercial dry food...
My guess is the dog was fed human scraps before...
Me going back to my favorite restaurant after the pandemic.
😂😂😂😂😂it s so funny 😂😂
My Bernie is the same way.
Dog likes the asmr aspect
It seems like you’re both in advanced obedience
My GS is the same way. He loves to think there is something special for him. Cheers
She only wants home cooked prople food! 😂
Hilarious! I’m gonna try that shit!
OMG! My cat is just as bad!!! I have to do something similar with her.
I have to do same for my chihuahua
Cute
Just like my German Shepherd she pulls this crap with me too😅
She is the best dog mom ever!!!! Lol love you girl lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
So cute😊😊
That is the best !!!!
Dog is saying, "I know there's nothing added to the bowl. I just like watching you jump through hoops to please me."
😂😂😂
Omg thats MY dog too
I have a routine with my cat now and it kinda built up over past year.  I have to spray his favourite toys with cat nip, brush him and play with his sweetie ball then ge will eat his meat.  How do they train us to do these things? It's never failed to amaze ke!
That is cruel !!! STOP BEING SO CHEAP and TREAT THAT DOG TO BETTER MEALS ...
Maybe it was just the stir at the end.
I have a shih-tzu diva that acts similiar
GSDs are awesome but yet so quirky.. love 'em!
How did the woman find out that this is what the dog wants?
Like most women... right!
Maybe you spoiled him/ her. That could be one of many reasons
If only people were so easily fooled! 😂♥️
You seam to love your dog, please look into the proses of how kibble is made and how it is killing dogs!  They tell you don’t feed ur dog people food. Because if you do the mega food makers will not make a profit of killing dogs.   I stoped feeding kibble and now I just make extra food and they eat what I eat every day!   How ever “bad” it may be its better then feeding them roten carcasses ( aka road kill)  that r permitted in kibble. Also by cooking that mixture at the high temps to kill the germs it also kills ALL the nutrients it had!  Please please stop fooling her and feed her good food!
And you did it lol there’s not a lot we won’t do for these spoiled brats 👍🏾😂😂😂😂
I fake it for my dog too. So funny.
My wife has done that for our beagle, and it works!  A dogs life! 🥰
😂😂
And who taught the dog this. You. And then the dog taught you.
Mine does the same thing
Pampered and spoiled princess
I love it! Heehee
My cat is like this.
Moms love
I prefer the 2 puppies in this to the dog
The dog expects her food to be prepared the same way you prepare your food.  She watches you to make sure you do it exactly the same way.😂
😮😮😮😮😮
She was just waiting for your command...we can see it in her body language...she was getting close to the food and not backing off when you went near..
Cutest spoiled dog ever! ❤
Smh laughing out loud. Tooo cute and funny and he or she is watching
That's hilarious and so cute.
Omg on the flo fresh pet 😂 plz zz 😂
Ummmm where's my WATER?
Yup, that’s called a German Shepherd !!!
That's because of the bulls**t dogfood you're feeding her.
Stuck up
Your dog is bougie
My lil chunk won’t eat till I pray over his food. Dogs are very smart and pick up on things you do. I bow my head and pray. He don’t know what I’m really doing but won’t eat unless I bow my head over his food and pray(or say some words)
🤣🤣❤😂😂
My German Sheppard was exactly the same way,  I had to shake a capped soy sauce bottle over her food and then stir it.
So cute! ❤
It has to be a shepherd thing!
My dog is the same way. I have to prepare his meal I cant just put it in his bowl.
Brilliant 😂
Funny great  but wrong . Have you ever seen a dog use to five steps but all of sudden only four It's not so funny great
So cute ❤
Hahahaha my dog is basically the same way! I thought maybe i spoiled him too much lol.😂❤
Oh bless so sweet.
At first I thought this was Kamala Harris's dog.
You serve me
So stupid!!! Dog want's fresh food. Whow careless!!😢
Try giving her a little chicken in that boring meal. Dry ass boring food. Let her live a little.
My pooch is spoiled the same way till it is ridiculous. He won't eat unless my daughter and I is in the same room to watch him eat. Or he wants something done to it so we pretend to stir and mix then he eats. We tried to break him from it but he will sit and stare at you while very low whining and huffing. It get sickening at times 😂
When that dog finds out you been lying it's gonna be trouble
My dogs AND CATS, make me do the same thing.
My cat is same way
😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂same with my maltipoo Frosty. Sometimes we had to sit with him or tell him that he is very brave and the best dog.😂😂😂😂😂
She’s bougie. lol
😂
I really hope she doesn't have children. They'd be the kind screaming in public places.
So funny
❤️it
She got used to you putting house food in her food
you wouldnt eat raw ingredients either.... now that its cooked with luv it tastes better :)
All K9 do that
More placebo, please”
How did you figure out that the dog wanted that? Dog people make up so many scenarios, just leave it alone and watch how quick they’ll eat once they are starving!
Hypes!
It’s called love. The dog needs to feel your loving cooking. Just like a man.
That dog is like, “Don’t give me no bagged up food, get in there and bang some pots hard as I guard this house”
I do that with my kids
That seems like a problem u created!!!lol
Mske her something special
Strange but i have two much stranger
You could have actually added some real extras in her bowl, coconut oil, nutritional yeast, just something something, she's a special lady 😊
❤❤❤
Why are you lying?
Shepard funny
:O
It's not ridiculous when you condition the dog like that. Somewhere down the line you did all that so that is the expectation of the dog from it's owner.
How cute!  How smart!  My cat is also like that.  I too am well trained!
It’s your fault you turned her into a Diva’🤣🤣🤣🤣
MY G.....U GOT SOME BIG O TITTS
Please add the special ingredients
Damn right as he should 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
I am glad to see i am not the only one who tells my dog what a good girl she is tobdeserve such a yummy dinner. She will sit and wait until i tell her that she is getting a special dinner. She reallly appreciates the extra TLC ❤
😂
😅 dogs can't go on social media to see its all a lie
Same as my dog 😅
Hahaha
Owner should eat less....
Mom's hot
What dog?
Leave it there. It will eat when it can’t handle it anymore
That's special I love it ❤
It's all about the presentation!❤🎉
Your dog loves you
Awe!!!!  ❤😂😅😊
I want milk now
She wanted the best ingredient love
LOL yummm
She is just wanting to feel loved
____ Stop feeding them dry food all the time ya idiot....That's what the dog is saying
That's the cutest ❤
Well, little does this lady know this has NOTHING to do with food. Rin Tin Tin just likes watching her make it. Good boy!!!
i often wonder ,of my dogs who actually OWNS WHO?!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why don't you be nice and put some sliced carrots in there?
What have you done to that poor dog? You need to go jail 😡
It’s all about the dining experience
Maybe they added (or sometimes add) something tasty to food.
Reminded me of my ex.
Why is the water bowl empty ? Is that another ritual ?
Dogs are so smart!!
Omg... I only noticed the dog after the 5th replay.
She knows you're not doing anything to it... she just wants to feel special!!! 😊😂😂❤
both of you should visit a shrink
❤❤❤😂
😂
My cat is exact same way. Hahaha
She’s hilarious! And you are so cute to play the game that’s love!🤌❣️
Would you change her....
So sweet ❤😂
Lol
The dog just enjoys you pretending to do something to there food 😂
Love it.  Mom you start things, now i insist you do your magic. Lol, they do train us....
This dog... definitely not ridiculous¡ Just special and human like. 😊
At least, if you know how to make good food for Dogs most of them will appreciate it forever, Unlike most Ungrateful kids nowadays that don’t even appreciate what parents do for them
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣… ❤️‍🔥
A German (shepherd). We’re following rules! Get over it!
? Who started doing it?   Now she spoiled
I just love, love this!!!!!! You should try to put chicken or beef stock, in a can whoch is really good! I just add it to her dry just for a little flavor and she just thinks that her dry food is the best!!!! Just try it then she will have a little treat!!!!  Beef stock 😮or chicken!!!!!  I make my own chicken broth because it is very easy!!! 🎉Please just pour it in her dry food, about half the can, depending onhow much dry you give your pup!!!! She will be sooooooo happy, just try it please!!!!  Joannie ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is what i do to mine if I run out of wet food. The trick works 😊
I love my dogs and I feed them different things that won't hurt them
Never mind you actually acting stupid…I suggest you give your dog a full bowl of clean fresh water.
Well if you really care and love them you would want them to have the best 🤷‍♀️ wonder if that woman is eating only dry food?
😢 Dont do that to the Dog give her some soft food mix Dogs get bored of same food mine live human food but i try stick to kibble n soft canned for my dogs
❤ that is just too cute :-)❤
😮
My dog does this too lol 😂😂😂😂
Human, did you know that she goes in the fridge when you all are asleep or out of the house and drinks from the pitcher without her red cup. Lol 😆
Dont do it. Let her starve for awhile. My parents taught me that when we had a cat. Starve it long eniugh and she'll learn to eat ewhatever you feed her when you feed her. Dont put up with the BS.
My puppy would NOT fall for this..😂
Ad some veggies 🥕
She really went “Yeah, you forgot to add the good stuff. Now gimme!” 😂😂😂
Just dont do that and see how long it takes for the hungry animal to eat the food, it will get the point after a bit.
So sweet, she wants her dinner like everybody else 😊
This ain’t Burger King,  You can’t have it your way  Straight to the pound
Love  lol 😊
😂😂😂😂
Now see, my Shepherd does the same thing, and I tried tricking her...she looks closely at the bowl and looks back at me with the expression, " what the h...."
I love that dog!!! Awesome.
LoL 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Beautiful dog
My Boston Terrier is the exact same way 😂😂😂
Lol my Boston won’t touch his food unless I put his dog spice on it!! All it this is dehydrated beef lung and liver ground up into a powder!! He literally will not eat without it
I'm going to try this with my dog who turned finicky
an animal won't let itself die of starvation. leave the fuckin' bowl there and it will eat! can't believe a human is doing imaginary things on purpose so the his dog will eat! and to think we consider ourself the most advanced of the animal species.... loll
😂😂😂
The extra air adds so much more flavor 🥰❤️
Please fill water bowl
We actually had a cat like that  You had to fake her out so she thought she was special
You started it!
Wheres the water
That's my dog made over
"Placebo chef" 😂😂
Sounds like my German Shepherd he likes melted butter poured over his
The dog's like, "I see you prepare your food!"
Just think:Always hopeful; every meal a disappointment you have to swallow and act like you're grateful so they'll feed you again tomorrow 🎉
I accidentally gave our dog the cheese in the green label bottle because she refused to eat and she is on special diet food so instead of faking I actually gave her cheese but she actually ate it ..
😂😂😂 that is a German Shepherd for you 100% 😂
You are very well trained 😂
Where is her link at ...😊
I do the same😅
Wow😂 this is just fabulous!!!! The dog is like” You took forever to spice and simmer your food and now you are just gonna poor my food into a bowl without any spice or preparation.? “ “ I want the same treatment “😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She was waiting for you to add love to it!
Cmon...She just wanted to show us her chest
👍🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣
Ha my dog is the same way I generally throw a few pieces of cat food in her food then she eats lol
Feed your dog well, honestly this video kinda annoyed me. Feed it some actual meat, something other than just kibble. I realize some people don’t have a lot of extra money but most people have food they throw away.. consider making meals for your dog mixed with their kibble.
Must be a German Shepard thing because I've seen two other dogs like this lol
Do it! She deserves it❤😊
😂😂😂 OMG❤❤❤😂😂😂
I guys do the same thing🤣🤣🤣
Women are so good at faking things 😂
My German Shepherd was the exact same way! 😆
GSD are smart! Wait until she figures that out too 😂
I have one.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They really can be ridiculous, can't they? I laughed till I wheezed at this one.
She wants what you’re having😄
There should be some meat added for real. Dry biscuits for dinner everyday must become so mundane.  All the same your short is hilarious and simply loving added was all she wanted. 😂😂😂❤❤
My kitty needs her food fluffed as well!
Instead of waisting time pretending, why dont you actually add some whole food in there for your dog
Poor dog is waiting  for real food.Lady your dog is smarter than you are.
😂😂😂😂
My dog's the same way I got a German shepherd too
Haha, "gourmet." That dog's not as smart as he thinks.
Made with love❤
Crap Kibble. Unnatural. Get the dog some human grade dog food
I think it's Pavlov's theory especially this smart breed. he or she Associates you putting in fresh kitchen food from prior days. Lol. Alot of animals are very clever
Lol!!!! My dog does the same. 😂
It appears that you have gave your dog table food before and that's why your dog doesn't want anything unless it resembles table food. 😂
Lmao
She loves invisible sauce And don’t exist vegetables in her food. Hook her up!!😂
She is special ❤
This Furbaby may not get a lot of attention because she loves it when Mom makes her dinner special. ❤❤❤❤
Now that so funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is so funny
I do the same for my dogs … now they older one wants to be cheered on when she is eating …
😂😂😂
Pffft! SMH .. everyone knows kibble tastes better with invisible liver and bacon chunks!
Add raw and cooked veggies. Dogs love it. Pumpkin is a must for domestic animals as it helps their tummies and bowels. There is a lot of pumpkin food for pets if you don't have the time to prepare it.
Spoiled
🩷
No one ever said dogs were smart lol
😂😂😂👍🏻
Kibble is the w worst food for dogs she’s trying to tell you she needs better food mom❤
YOU HAVE TO TRICK HER MINDSET?!!! ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!! 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂❤❤
do it every time, youll miss it when shes gone
Intelligent dog. Knows what YOU do with your food, and expects the same treatment.  Can't say mine are much different... they both had salmon with their meal today... MY salmon. Well... the extra one I bought for them so they'd eat the same as me.  I'm worse. You at least pretend!
The first problem was you bought a purebred of one of the smartest psychotic breeds there are.
I have the same issue. 😂
My cat does the same. The Labrador though eats anything in milliseconds
🤦🏾‍♂️Damn! I thought it was just my dog😂😂😂
They don’t make dog food with love, it’s something you have to add before serving.
Lmao
DAMN I thought the camera was gonna show her cheeks in those shorts 😂🤣
My GSD is that way too. He would not be fooled by the fake actions. He smells the bowl when you walk by him. Lol
the dog is playing the longest prank in history! who's playing who
If no one ever  did something special to her food. How did she get the idea ?
I’m thinking the dog has OCD😂😂😂
I laugh so hard!
She want you to cook her some shit
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ so adorable cute and precious so spoiled
Cut the crust and slice my sandwich please! 🤣😋
Maybe give her REAL FOOD - that's what she's trying to tell you. Bet YOU don't eat pellets every day & nothing else FOH
I tried that and I was bitten after some serious side-eye,
Nice boobs😅
😂❤️
She Wants her food cooked and prepared like for the rest of the family. Our dog is the same 😂
Poor puppy
