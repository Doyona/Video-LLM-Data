Bro is OBSESSED with Hasan 😂
😂😂😂
Tiny head hasan shows every trait of a psychotic narcissist.. The lying, animal abuse and self loving manipulative behaviour further proves it yet theres still degenerate leftoids out there who like him.. But then again! Its easy to trick simple minds and birds of the same feather flocks together... And we all know the left is a psychotic delusional death cult!
The worst thing to come out of this is that I had to watch a fucking asmondgold clip, and I will never forgive Hasan for that.
2 weeks later and it isn't actually over, and hasan got away with it
This overused title lol
When we are unable to properly produce a pure copper coin, there is a problem.
Animal abuse isn’t small though
how dare you notice this when theres a genocide happening
Can we get a stream where Asmon wears a shock collar & upon horrific political takes chat gets to shock? 👀
God i fucking hate that guy
Thank Emmanuel it's finally over. Poor Kaya. 😮‍💨  What's done in the dark will come to the light. 🛐
Like a kid caught lying 😂
This is all content. He's discovered a new formula for ragebait and it's working.
He shocked a dog who tf cares    Meanwhile this dirty who also slept next to a dead rat called for the unaliving of people
Inability to admit that your wrong, is a characteristic of a personality disorder.
"another plane hits the tower" and yet they say hes not against a sepicific group i dont like hasan too but bro atleast try to hide that ur whole community is people who hate arabs,muslims,and support the genocide in gaza its a household for those people to relate and laugh about the genocide in gaza and he literally watches videos made to make fun of muslims their religion and their culture like how blatant can u be that u are running a racist community ofcourse he wants to be blatant too cause his whole audience is happy with him for supporting their motives
The city needs to confiscate that dog
Who in their right mind would believe that shocking a dog is the end of Hassan’s career? Do these people that believe in harming people(to say the least), care about a dog?
Shocking 😂😂😂
If you’ve gotta shock your dog, that means you don’t deserve one.
So Hasan was Qabih? The irony…
He must be friends with trump to avoid prison so well.
"Its actually over", funny how its been "over" for years without ever being "over"
This would make a good meat canyon skit.
This dude looks like he sits in that chair 24/7/365, and no time spent with that dog.
Hasan looks like one of those people you'd see at Starbucks drinking a soy latte
lol we get it you hate hasan who cares
Show this to all of the redditors and weirdos who first said “she nipped herself on the bed”
Jesus died on the cross for our sins and if we repent (turn from sin) and truly follow Him (grace and faith) we will be saved, He is coming soon, and God's wrath is real and all who reject Christ are under it, but He loves us so much He doesnt want us Lost, amen, love y'all 🙏❤️ REPENT
This really is the crank/dipshit corner of the internet.
Hasan can suck my dick
Someone needs to report hasan to the police for animal abuse. that shits a felony. let him chose 20 years in prison or being de.. uh harbored to gaza.
That glasses to mustache ratio tells me don’t let this dude near schools or parks
Imagine caring this much that you go back to pre-Christmas apparently.
Remember everyone, Twitch supports and condones animal abuse, and terrorism :(
FREE FREE PUPPYSTINE
Hell nahhh Hasan looking crazy lately
Side note,what’s he got a Christmas tree for?Isnt he Muslim or something ?
People will still defend this
So what’s the wrong doing? What does it matter if there’s a shock collars? Does he and his girl use it or is it just for the dog?
Ofcourse it was a shock collar.. no dog react like this..  Look how the dog reacts.. ofcourse thats a shock....
Shocker, textbook liar and chronic narcissist who demonized Orthodox Jews as “inbred” and has dehumanized a Jewish man as a “bloodthirsty pig dog” after Oct. 7th, also abuses animals. Why is anyone shocked?
I know you're trying to shock Kaya again, Hasan. I just can't prove it
How you look at your own camera guilty? Looking on your own camera is wild.
narc simulator
Take the dog away for him I hope they take him  away to a better family
He won't say he uses it because he knows he is using it to abuse the dog.
Typical liberal…. Lie to all of our faces then gaslight you when they know they’ve been caught. lol and I don’t even care about the animal rights thing. (Electricity is used a LOT in agriculture for animals safety mostly like electric fences keeping them out of places they shouldn’t go cause they could fall or whatnot)
Muslim... what did you expected
This guy is absolutely f****** psychotic! I've never met a real fan of his, but if I ever do, that's gonna tell me a lot!
You people are sad
Has anyone reported this bastard? This guy has some issues, treating his dog like his own slave probably makes feel empowered, what a disgusting human being.
Making fun of him instead of truly care about the dog. Your favorites streamers are the most disgusting human being. But keep feed their bank account brain rot people
Hitler Hasan fr...
Free Kaya
Violent douche is a violent douche, surprise?
Animal abuser
Hasan is a very charismatic sociopath
Yeah the cancel attempt is over and it failed.  Cancel culture magats are the most worthless humans
I have no idea who the little twit is, but I do know that anyone who hurts an animal is the worst sort of human. Psychologically very ill beyond hope. They don't need to be walking among us. They should be kept locked away for their entire existence.
"There is no war in Ba Sing Se... "
the fact that it looks exactly the same as on the picture and so visibly too
It’s over 😢
How does a piece of crap like him have a following? I guess so did hitler.
The dog seems to beg the visitors "please get me outta here"
I tried to fair to Hassan because I’m conservative and didn’t want to be biased but then I watched again today and saw him reach for something and his dog yelp at the exact moment and now this lol I think it’s fair for any doubters left to call it.
1:14 come-on!!! The poor dog made a tiny movement🤦🏽
Dude is textbook  psychopath.
He's running North Korea in his house.
who was the streamer that said they knew for a fact that it was the vibrating version....
Smash & Bash
Lolll
Hasan Palpatine
Is it OVER yet? Asking for a friend.
"Educator"
What’s wrong with having a shock collar on your dog? It’s for training purposes yall really thing he’s just sitting there shocking his dog?
Where is animal control on this case??
new UI looks weird
He's a narcissist. Not a flippant version of the term. An actual narcissist.
not even the least bit subtle at all either....it has to be on purpose at this point, no one is this stupid
It makes much more sense if you realize hes a psychotic, narcicisst who needs to lie to himself so he doesnt fsll into a depression. He himswlf doesnt think he is a liar because its imprinted in in his mind that he is not. Hes a pathological one.
the way his fatass doesn't only move it outta frame but proceeds to pick up a cake or cookie or whatever and eats it in the same motion man this loser needs to be taken out back istg lmfao he has lived such a sheltered life
The sad part is that it ain't over. He's not getting banned. This fucker could murder a person live and twitch mods would probably hold two meetings before they authorize banning him.
I keep seeing Hassan is over. Is it because he used a shock collar??
It literally just vibrates you dolts.  You guys believe anything hooooly fuck
The fact that Hasan is followed by so many people is mind-blowing to me. Guy is such a slime and acts like a classic narcissist - are people blind or just don’t give a damn about it?
He became too brave and careless. Bravo Vince.
Why is a muslim celebrating christmas?
Isn't that a chow chow,  im not surprised 😂
So what? I'm confused
Go after him Trump
It's wild that he is going down for a dog(deservedly so) but he has advocated for the killing of so called capitalists many times.
Is the device illegal where he is?
can't wait to see what the "You're crazy if you think he has a button" guys think now
Damn why trash psychopath like this have any audiance 😢
I’ve been out of the loop. When did Asmon switch from being a gamer streamer to a right wing shill streamer?
I don’t get it we had one for our dog.if he wants a shock collar on his don’t he can.mabey I missed something
Muslim marxist treating animals like slaves lol
I love Hassan
The retards that use shock collar's are brain-dead, i have trained dog for 20+ years, pitty, rotti, Shepard's, bullys and no matter what you are training it for, a shock collar is not needed, stop trying to say you need to use them on aggressive dog, you stupid mfers.
I’d like to punch that dude right in his face.
Ah yes, film yourself moving the remote out of sight. Real smart move
Stop tormenting the poor dog, you sadist
Can someone please explain how shocking a dog is any different to shocking a human with a taser for the purpose of restrain? I don’t get the big deal
Look up Narcissistic Personality Disorder.... NPD.....   you'll understand hasan completely.
I hope someone puts one on Hassan
I dont get the doubts… Are there really people who tried to deny evidence ?
I cannot believe Hasan isn't acting. This shit's seriously hilarious
“He never admits he’s ever wrong even with anything really small”.  Bro is turning into Trump.
It’s pr now for him btw
Imagine being a bunch of grown men, who obsess other another grown man (Asmongold) who is obsessing over another man, who they all claim to hate.   Also, you guys talking about anyone not admitting they’re wrong is comical. You all have massive egos, from mom’s basement, and haven’t admitted being wrong in years. The guy you vote for hasn’t admitted being wrong in his entire life.   Hasan admits he’s wrong constantly. But yes, keep letting Asmongold tell you what Hasan says. Don’t just listen for yourself.
If you are anyone looking to defend Hasan, YOU ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THIS SITUATION.  Stop it…get some help!
Has this MF already been banned?
What's going on here...can anyone explain
Me as a european person im allways impressed how obsessive the american internet user are when they hate somebody, all of the sudden everybod becomes some kind of FBI investigation special forces wich will find everything.
What do they say about men who like to abuse animals ? Maybe check his property ? His travel history for unsolved crimes and missing persons ?
This is good evidence but how do we know it’s not AI
is he not face of twitch ? your telling me twitch support animal abuse ?
the vibrator is for him, the zap is for the dog
teachnically... it could still just be used with it's vibrate function or noise stimulation button. But why would he ever act so suspicions or even invest so much money into a device with 100 different electric Stimuli levels
I knew he was dumb (and evil) I didn't think he was THAT dumb
I would never use an e collar on my dogs but it's literally not even that bad. The "best trainers" (not really.. the best are behavioral specialists) use E-collars. It's not the end of the world but hasans  reaction is so  revealing it's hilarious I hope he loses his whole fan base
If he would have pushed that button by mistake😂
Exactly nothing is going to happen to the guy and in 2 weeks all of you will be looking at a whole other bs social media shitstorm
He was supporting Pakistan
How can this guy have any amount of fans at all. He literally thinks you’re the dumbest people on the planet if he thinks he was slick/ unnoticed with this…
Hasan fell off, that's why he doing too much
This Pikachu got caught so hard
uhhh, it's bait. don't eat it, dudes. he could've easily switched back from the wide shot instead of bringing attention to "the thing" he doesn't wanna show.
I mean he’s already admitted it and doubled down so why hide it at this point?! 🤦🏼‍♀️ What an absolute troglodyte
Its not even funny ffs. That dog deserves a comfortable life, not a scumbag like him who clearly doesnt love it. Why would he be randomly shocking the dog just because it moved. The terrorist loving rat needs that dog taken off him.
Typical
Those devices do serve a legitimate  purpose IF, used by RESPONSIBLE trainers/owners.  That animal ABUSER  is not a responsible user.  He should be dealtvwith accordingly.
Why in the flying fish is anyone actually suprised that the guy who invited A LITERAL HEZBOLLAH TERRORIST onto his stream is a piece of human garbage?
Hasan is definitely the guy who goes all the way in the Milgram experiment.
His mom could have used one of those on him, maybe...
Calling him Bay Harbour Shocker is wild
Thank God it isn't titled "hasan is COOKED Now!" Once we get some original content and not just reading headlines, we'll have some decent content again.
I already hated Hasans guts, this just affirms my hate for him. He's an asshole of the highest order. And to all his d@ck sucking fans who are making excuses for this behavior. You are in severe denial because you cant accept being on the wrong side of choosing good and bad people to support. You chose wrong. You are the baddies.
I have a black sense of humour, but, THIS is not a laughing matter. The guy is a terrorist activist, and he's cruel to animals.
EVERY communist is a fascist! That's a fact not an if...
So it wasn’t over the last 10 times? Please lemme know when It actually ends ffs😂
Ive conversed and argued with 2 different people that are defending him and oh my god it’s exhausting
Send that Mf to Norway, and i will kill him myself, and get a golden star from the King.
even the austrian painter treated animals better then this rat..
The coachroch still jerking off to Hasan 💩🇮🇱💩
When its actually, in fact, not over.
Please get that man removed from the spotlight.
I love how the left eats meat, has no clue how animals are dispatched, and  yet they continue eating their own over a shock collar... ROFL>
I hope this commie piece of shit can rip now
He gets a week ban, tops
Hassan is a fn moron
Asmongold and mark goldbridge share the same definition of crisis except asmon nearly did get cancelled
i dont care for any of you but fuck sake get off his cock on this lmao
Hasan is a disgusting abuser to kaya? 😮
Mostly peaceful electrocutions
Islam hates dogs
Bro amber hearding himself again
"I HATE POWER ABUSE 😡😡😡, ONLY I CAN PERFORM IT, NOT OTHERS!!! 🤬😡🤬😡🤬"
Wait was he trying to say it was a can of zyns? 😂
Ok PETA, here’s the evidence! Where’s the condemnation?
Internet is undefeated dont even try Hasan..
Fuck that guy! Needs to be canceled. STOP WATCHING HASAN! STOP GIVING HIM MONEY NOW!
Get off dudes dick. Holy shit
The “Eletric Wizard Master” attacks again!⚡️🌩️
He never admits he's wrong because he is a narcissist!
Is he in jail yet?
This racist is worried about a dog but dont say anything about the gestapo ice. Fuck him.
oh wauw whoopdiewhoop someone got a shock collar on his desk.
I just waiting what’s the excuse😂😂😂
Ah another leftist loon who belongs in hell 🎉
Shocking aside, its not fair to force your dog to stay in its bed all that time.
Maybe if he understood how hard it is to own a ChowChow he wouldn’t need a shock collar and would have taken the time to train properly
Piker is a damn loser... sadly all this attention is actually in his favor...
Just a genuinely SHIT human.
From the fridge to the TV, Kyla will be free! HAHAHA xDD
Its pislam garbage! what do you expect? Americans should wake up and rise against this filth
Evil people torture animals. It is a mental illness and widely known. Like the 2 trans people who set a dog on fire and killed it. These are the types of people who need to be in jail, not in society.
What rhymes with Hasaan? I'll tell you:          You're wrong
Sad thing about lying is you always got to keep up with it. Being a streamer and a liar is wild if you think about it.
So what???? It's a fucking DOG
From the bed to the TV, Kaya will be free!
It’s funny how ya mfks don’t have this same energy for human rights. I swear YT people are weird asf. Don’t have any of this energy for your fellow man. 😂
Hassan Is ten times the person you are. Btw it's not a shock collar. 🙄
It's actually over...
and he still wasnt in jail some whatever the fucking reason is we have all the reason to put him in jail but he still there ..... what a world we live in even a for dog life is hard now...
Is that an Ecollar or a shock collar?  Ecollars are actually very safe and do not shock
how many time its over just this week, hollyshit
why is the dog even there?
A Muslim didn't account for one thing. White westerners love for dogs.
caught in 4k
I can’t stand people who present themselves as champions of freedom and enemies of fascism, yet use every fascist tactic imaginable. They’re the worst kind of hypocrites. It’s because of people like that that Trump was able to label Antifa—a concept, not an organization—as terrorists.
Hassan is an Ebegger
Incels will 100% still support him and watch his content.
More than him shocking the dog. It's about the dog sitting at the same place for so long which is more damaging for the dog than the shock itself.
I can't believe even the fake statue has to sit in the spot.
I fucking hate you cunt streamers. You all contribute negatively to society. The world would be a better place without Hasan and this neck beared loser having any relevance.
People use shock collars every day. He should just admit it and say yes that's how I've chosen to train my dog. I don't tell you how to train yours, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell me how to treat mine. The only issue I have with Hasan at the moment is the fact that he's attacking people (often personally) for calling him out for using it, and he goes on the attack instead of being shameful for lying about it.
wow not seen asmongold videos in a while, he looks closer to death than ever. Scraggly hair, missing teeth, red skin 1:17. He is not well.
You do know those collars are legal though. They're specifically designed for behavioural correction so what's the issue?
I wonder what the gaslight is going to be this time
How TF is this dude not cancelled everywhere ? WTF is wrong with twitch ?!
Hasan is such an asset to social justice precisely because he is a performative, arrogant liar.
bro hates "facism" yet is fine with shocking his dog. lets deport hasan
Animal abuser.🤬
I really just can't stop laughing at this whole situation
These animal abuse defenders in the comments are vile excuses of humans, shame.
Your a smuck.
So what do you do over there in this kind of situation?
(a second edit at the top because it's important. The PG-300 looks exactly like the collar held up if he ordered the black remote variant. Exclusively a vibration only collar). i looked up this stuff. seems to be an educator brand but all their collars have the same shape (and you can pick remote color even though they seem to color based off size and strength off the shelf). it may shock, it may only vibrate. even their marketing is unclear. i think it's narrowed to "the boss" or the "K-9" type though. both are the big dog type and both are black. i see "don't shock your dog" in the boss page video though (edit) it's not the ET-300 mini, that's for small dogs, but also the ET-300 uses the "blunt" verbiage in it's marketing if he had scrolled down on that exact page. that indicates it only vibrates.
Oh, just another 'conspiracy theory' that turns out to be accurate.  Surprise...
He could be... COULD I'm saying,  not IS, necessarily ... but he COULD BE a sociopath. Just sayin.
If someone is lying about small things like that already, thats telling a lot about his character
So now what, nothing will happen, that's right
And still live on Twitch, while others get banned for breathing. :D
So, no surprise here, knowing Islam and its consistent use of taqiyya (lies, deception, concealment) for its own gain.  Also, why is this perpetually angry muzzie d1ckhead living in a country he so hates (and has said so many times)??? And why does he decorate the room with Christmas decor when he hates Christians??? Strange. Or just taqiyya.   Just as all of "them" who come to my country (a country created with Christian values) to try and take over from within, like a cancer, through deception and false kindness in order to implement pigfvcking sharia.  Their "religion" is not peaceful. It's a lie and very much the opposite of American culture and freedom of anything whatsoever. Complete dogsh!t is what it is.   Worshipping a meteorite and a child rap!ng murderer is not what I would call a good choice to base my life upon.  Misogynistic rap3 culture that forces women to hide their God-given human forms under a mass of heavy black cloth or suffer consequences, and who believe they will get a bunch of virgins in heaven to rap3 to fill their desire as a gift from Allah, if they kill people in his name is soooooo intelligent and loving.  They should all go home. And home is not here in the US. Not for their dogsh!t rules and way of thinking. Sorry, but not sorry. These are the rules, and they don't like playing by them, so ...get TFO. I see their military-style training camps and their brainwashing techniques taking place. Just remember, they lost the last time they tried to conquer God loving, freedom loving peoples too. Just saying.  Funny how someone who hates America lives and thrives here. What a lying, hateful, seething, unimportant, yet wealthy, but weak little cvnt.
He's so fucking guilty
remember when 4chan wage war on people for animal abuse? what happened to them
who gives a shit if the dude uses a shock collar on or to train his dogs, mine gots one, neighbors gottem. fuck yall pussy ass bleeding animal heart idiots. it doesnt even actually damage them
Hasan is a textbook narcissist
I’ll say this, if ppl wanna use shock collars to keep dogs in an unfenced yard then yea, but I believe the same owners should be made to test out the product around their neck before being allowed to purchase
john wick this terrorist loving trash
A shock collar for a dog is animal abuse? Some dogs yap out of control, and need to learn to withhold if they’re living in apartments, or even yapping for no apparent reason.   I guess I’m a cruel person but I’m pro shock collar. They’re not designed to hurt the dog. They’re not even effective long term because your dog will realize it’s not hurtful and will continue to bark through the shocks.
Twitch should ban hasan youtube should ban hasan every social media platform should ban hasan all of his assets need to be seized and he needs to be deported
This makes me so pissed.
Nobody can deny the barbarism of Hasan on Dogtober 7th. This was the largest attack on dogs since the Haitian migrants.
I think hasanabi is one of the biggest if not the biggest snake in streaming world.
It's the anal plug I swear, I started playing chess recently!
Pretty unemployed if you watch hours of this content
I mean, he said openly that his dog  has a collar that vibrates but doesn’t shock which one would use a remote for as well. It’s a pretty normal training tool. Also, he didn’t even look up at the camera immediately after, he could have easily just been checking the shot. I’m not saying I know what’s going on but this seems pretty clearly an unfair analysis and a smear campaign.
Pack him up, get him outta here.  That poor dog. 😢
You know, just talking about my life experience, usually the people who advocate the most for rights etc are awfull people deep down
Ain’t this Asmongold the same guy who said people shouldn’t care about Kristi Noem unaliving her dog because “it’s just a dog”. Funny how he suddenly cares about a shock collar when it’s an adversary.
I am confused. He always was open about using a vibrating collar, no? What's the problem here?
Nuke this guy's home
And nothing will be done about it. Twitch and his supporters cheer for him promoting literal terrorist and terrorism. You think animal abuse is off the table for these freaks?
what a piece of shit man
Yall care more about that dog, than your own governments democracy. Shut up
All it took was one slip up and everything went downhill after that.
No guys, that's the most peaceful collar in the world
shut up bloody gummed booger boy
If you use shock collars for dogs in Germany, you are officially an animal abuser. What a digsuting human being this Hasan guy
He is going to take the pirate software approach i see
Typical communist behaviour.
FREE!!! FREE PAW-LESTINE!!!   HELL YEAH, FROM THE HYDRANT TO THE TREE, PAW-LESTINE MUST BE WILL BE ISHALAH! IT WILL BE FREE
I got a zyn ad 😂
I keep seeing these clips and videos. What did he do? Are people trynna cancel him simply over a shock collar? Or was he not using it right?   I've been a vet tech & worked in rescues on & off for over 12 years now and have seen soo many cases where it's being over used or not used right. If it's used more than half power more than like twice a day their will without question always be a patchy area with hairl loss, burns to the area and the prongs sometimes break the skin and even cause infection and discoloration.  But if used correctly, meaning you try the levels on yourself first to know how it feels (even though dogs have tougher skin than humans, and many have a undercoat or double under coat and medium to long hair too, and they don't have pores like us)  so however it feels when you test it on yourself, it'll be slightly less for them, also if it's not too tight, and the prongs ALWAYS come with rubber type cap to put over them so it's not just metal on the dogs neck, and most always come with a beep, vibrate and shock mode and many are sound activated, so when the barking volume reaches a certain level it will beep 3 times, vibrate then bee 3-6times and then shock once or twice then repeat. Also there's many levels to them.   No taking up for him, but in my years of experience people get pretty dramatic and upset about them. And it's understandable especially if you don't understand or just hate the things, but if he over using it/abusing the dog with it you wouldn't be able to hide it, if you see the neck where it is that will always tell you no question.   If he had a moment where he was being a d**k & hit shock when he didn't need to I totally get it, but I still don't think that warrants him to be cancelled or have his dog taken away. Just the few seconds I've been seeing you can tell that dog is very well taken care of and loved. Animal control can do an investigation and if the dogs neck is fine I feel a warning is ok.  That's like taking somebody kids away because their parents were too abrasive or had a moment the disciplined or spanked them when they know there was no need. Doesn't mean the child isn't safe or loved, not excusing it but there may be some day mom or dad are exhausted or fed up or something and most people who've lived with either or both parents I'm sure have at least 1 or 2 stories where your parents were dead wrong for whooping your ass or snatching you up or popping you. Doesn't mean you should've been put in foster care and your parents charged or jailed. Not making excuses but regardless of the BS he's put out and who's tried to defend him. The one way to for sure clear it up is to show the dogs neck as it takes at LEAST 2+ weeks to heal from it. I've seen it hundreds of times at work when weve had to talk to owners or call animal control or even refuse to return the dog or picking up rescues. Don't know who the guy is and the few clips I've seen of him he seems annoying lol but from what I've seen so far I don't think he deserves to be cancelled or bankrupt or jailed or have his dog taken. Unless somebody posts the dogs neck and it shows it clearly is not used properly/ abusing the dog with it.
It's funny to point out his obvious lies, but it's not going to move the needle at all for his audience.
People who don't mind seeing animals suffer, usually enjoy when humans do as well. Dude is a psychopath.
I'm 40. I've lived long enough to know people by the look on their face. This Hasan person is an out-of-reality egotistic maniac. Zero doubts about it. If I met him in real life I would do anything to avoid having to spend time with him.
Actual POS. Shouldn't have a dog.
there would have been dog hair on the tape
If after all the shit he's said and done, he gets cancelled for a shock collar on his dog..... It will be some poetic justic
The guy is a muslim. Why is he celebrating Christmas?
I'll never understand what makes this Hassan fool worth watching, much less fanning over. "America deserved 9/11 hur dur" should've been enough to drive sane people away.
I knew I hated this dude for a reason
Yeah IF ANYONES DEFENDING HIM AFTER THIS YOUR EITHER STUPID or found the literal drink called copium cause MANS DELIBERATELY TRIES TO HIDE IT OUT OF FRAME AFTER
Hoax. Can't take Homeless Jesus seriously 😂
I'd bet on it too. And I am no betting man. And because I rarely bet, I have a 100% succesrate because I only bet on sure things, and I am 100% willing to bet my savings account on this one
I like how the dog is showing affection to the other people in the room, not Hasan
Narcissists NEVER admit they are/were wrong. That's one of their main things. Also you cannot cure a person with NPD. What can you do? Lock them up with sociopaths and psychopaths, but society isn't ready for this "insane" technique of making the world a better place.
The fact that it took this specific incident and this much evidence to prove that Hasan Parker is a DBag is baffling to me
I keep telling ppl long before that i dont like this fella now its evident
It's never over with this guy.
You can't be someone who advocates for basic human rights, and human welfare and at the same time be a sociopathic animal abuser. It just doesn't work that way. It might work for the right, but everyone on the left should immediately cut ties with Hasan and call him out for what he is. A hypocrite and an animal abuser.
The only thing you can expect from a muslim is evil
Screw that guy, find him, and teaser him for teasering doggies
Τhis is how little he cares about the poor dog.., when he doesn't realise to hide the damn thing before placing the cameras.
That is too funny, the dude is done 🤣🤣
I don’t get why people are surprised (I almost said shocked) that a man who supports terrorists is cruel to his dog. He only cares about himself!
Hassan is a lier and he is shocking his dog.
these commie podcasters are nothing but chumps.....they talk so much shit....i remember hearing one of them say he was "strapped" in the destiny election cope video.....please......if there was to be some sort of civil war event, that shit would be over in a fucking day....hours even
It’s not shocking at all ….
I dont know why anyone is surprised a piece of human garbage like Hassan Abuses his dog.
Kinda feels like proof that he pathologically lies?
OK NOW WE CAN GO AND REPORT HIS CHANNEL🙂
You mean a vibrating collar might also have a remote…? To you know, vibrate with?
His friends all know, to talk about him! So twitch has more views then kick lol kick has more views because it's less rules. Twitch isn't going to band hahasn for that lol😂
This is on purpose , so we talk about him lol 😂 were falling for it
The mental gymnastics that are about to  erupt from his constituents will be legendary.
can someone edit the 0:20 frame and put him in an orange prison jumpsuit with that facial expression? it'd go hard on X or as a thumbnail
hahahahahaha I love how streamers are always cooking themselves because they recorded themselves doing the very thing they swear they did not do and here it is, livestreamed video footage evidence of the rat dog abuser terrorizing his dog
This is the kinda guy to beat his dog just because everyone found out he was abusing it....
Grade A narcissist. He will NEVER admit wrong doing or a simple mistake. He'll deflect and gaslight.
I thought that was the dog with the Santa hat on cause that's what he likes in his dog. Zap 'em until they freeze like statues. Jesus H Christ what a tube.
The only power he has over any female.
Well, well, well, fancy that.
I don’t ever want to be recommended this channel again. Dude should never talk about anybody with his nasty ass house
Dox that mf
what a fucking piece of crap poor dog
i can only imagine how he treats his women
The dog sees hasan as a fascist
If he treats his dog this way. Imagine what else he is hiding.
que mogólico de mierda.
I think next we'll see Hasan shows a perfectly similar button just to tell us it's a button for another thing.
the loser doesnt even put up his own decorations, he just sits there while his friends do the work 😡
He Probably holds the dog at gunpoint if shock collar is ineffective
Narcissist be narcissizing😂  How can you can tell when an N steps in shit? They'll track it back to you.
Extreme leftists always lie.
Hassan “this puppy is rated for 40 amps” Piker
He’s such a piece of shit
For something that's perfectly okay and harmless he sure doesn't want anyone to know it exists 🤔💬 🐕 ⚡
This guy is such a dumb@ss
If he admited when he was wrong thats all he would be able to do
he deserves to lose everything, including his freedom. only a disgusting excuse for a human would use this device, there is no reason to shock a dog.
Nah he's farming the attention. But I guess I clicked too so you're farming me.. wonder what the long term effect is.
Hasan doing a piratesoftware
0:20 Hashock looked so guilty
my dad always told me..'if you never lie to people you never have to try and remember what storys you told what people'..... he has made this into what it has become. ego and pride are terrible vice to have.
This video also shows that his friends are willing to lie on his behalf and cover up animal abuse. No way in hell they never saw that thing with all the times they have been over.
Hasan is the worst criminal.
Vibration collars are fine. Shock collars are not. The best way to test the difference is to press it to your wrist. I have experienced both. A shock collar to your wrist above the 3rd level feels like a mini tazer or sticking a fork in a socket. Vibration collars tell the dog "hey pay attention" like tapping someone on the shoulder. I'm a pet groomer and had one client use the shock collar. There were permanent scars on this dog's neck. It was so happy to see me and take a break on his kennel. I could've gotten him done in 2 hours but always quoted 4 hours because the dog was terrified and neurotic around his owner. So I gave him his safe space every 6-8 weeks 🥺
Ew, he's so pathetic and gross! Girls who find this animal abusing psychopathic manchild sexy are mentally disturbed. STOP watching his streams, unsubscribe and do not support anything he puts out. If we can't get Kaya away from this monster, we must do everything in our power to make him miserable!
It's over. He must be arrested and prosecuted for animal abuse.
I know Asmon and Hasan have beef, but come on,  if he wants to have shock collar and its not illegal in the US he can do it. Same thing as having a gun. And I am not a Hasan fan, but i just think Asmon is farming the situation a little bit too much,
Why isn't he allowed to use a shock collar?
This is actually so disgusting, what an absolute piece of it
"Muslim punishes dog for being evil shaitan in the name of Al-Lah"
Now the argument is going to turn into all of hasans fans saying shocking your dog isn't abusive and it's just normal.  Watch
if it just vibrates why is he worried about it so much
It's funny how he looks up at the camera like a person committing a crime realizing they were caught and it's his own camera he put there. What an imbecile.
Chutiya owner
the agenda from 2012 is all falling apart. thank you jesus christ
Shock collars are Legal lol  People are babies 😂😂😂 so soft
Bro he already said THAT WASNT a shock collar you’re all just mad he’s handsome and rich he’s prettier than all of you combined, HASMON GOLD YOURE DIRTY AND OLD, GET A REAL LIFE OUT OF THE COMPUTER, THIS DOESNT MAKE YOU ANY BETTER, LOOSEERRRR. ANYONE WHO WATCHES YOU, IS AS PATHETIC AS YOU ARE, maybe, JUST maybe, GET REAL FRIENDS? Maybe, GO ONTO A REAL EVENT, maybe have A OPINION ABOUT ANYTHING. you’re just a looser that tries to look cooler, you’ve been bullied you’re WHOLE LIFE FOR A REASON. Drink water you’re so skinny sooooo skinny no one can see you, and the only thing that makes relevant is being UGLY AND PATHETIC. What makes you seem , “RELATABLE” to the man *mostly* who are still living with their mom, YOURE OLD, UGY, NO WIFE, NO KIDS, NO ANYTHING OTHER COMPUTER MONEY. YES, YOURE RICHER THAN ME BUT I HAVE DIGNITY, FRIENDS, CLEAN BODY, AND SELF LOVE. YOURE AN INSECURE TEENAGE GIRL, WITH BODY ISSUES, WHOS HAD DEPRESSION FOR WAY TO LONG.
I just feel bad for his dog. This guy is like Hitler for dogs
It's not over for the dog.  That's what we care about right?... the dog? Glad we're all having fun
Hassan shocked his dog. I guess it's time for a Holocaust. I don't see what else conservatives have planned as a response to this
I do find it funny that for years, Hasan was a terrorist-supporting antisemitic hypocrite and liberals will only trash him now for shocking his dog.
Electric, but mostly vibrating collar
A lot of dog owners are giant pieces of shit. Like the ones that keep their dog chained and alone outside forever.
Well collar me shocked he DID have one of those...
i hate this guy
what a dumb fkn thing for you and your economically motivated ‘ethics’ to be fixated on. it’s genuinely embarrassing to those with a modicum of intelligence.
It's interesting, how his defense, and the way his followers defend him, keeps changing.  1. "Hasan didn't do anything.  His dog's dewclaw got caught on the bed, or she just reacted because she was being scolded."  2. "Okay, so he used a device on the dog, but it was just a vibrator."  3. "Look at the big party that he just threw for his dog.  He couldn't possibly be an abuser.  Never mind what you saw yesterday.  That doesn't matter anymore."  4. "You people are ridiculous for caring so much about a dog.  This means that you don't care at all about what is happening to people in other parts of the world.  Shame on you!"  What will it be next?  By the way, those who care more about animals than they care about people have always been on the left, so that last one strikes me funny.
Nothing to see here, Mr Business 😅
The saddest part of all; was all the leftist RUNNING COVER FOR HIM. Is that specific collar (one of many collars) able to just vibrate if you leave the contacts covered? Or does it only work as a shock collar?
he wasn't hiding it >.> he's training his dog, shock collars are one way to train your dog he even admitted it forever ago it's not wrong to train your dog
It’s so good to see this sick fuck being exposed
jesus
at this point , its just farming clips.....
I don't know whether it's a bright side or not but the ET-300-BK Remote Transmitter and the Shock collar Hasan is using is getting A lot of free Advertising
idgaf about hassan. but half yall probably beat your dogs
Thor got cancelled for ALOT less than this, why the fuck is this guy still here?
I wonder if his friends he does that podcast with will distance themselves from him....
Calling us stupid,dumb, gullible and believing everything online even his friends say it but lookie lookie 😪
Dude needs to be deported
That poor dog.  Jesus Christ, Hasan is a total piece of shit. Go figure a raging Communist wants to exert total control over another entity.
What a minute... no way hasons a piece of shit 😂
What’s his address?
Who cares if he has a shock collar?
HE DONE FUCKED UP!
Can't to see Ethans reaction to this
Piker is to the Left what all the Chomo pastors are to the Right. "Do as I say, not as I do." Sickening.
Well when has a rich kid ever admitted they were wrong?
Bro is cooked.
Please stop writing "over" over and over again.
This is his "I was out of mana" moment
EviI has an expiration date.
Dude used to be a fan but fuck Hasan for this
The wildest part of this story is that nobody cared when he was advocating for the murder of people on the right,  but he shocks a dog and the internet's mind collectively explodes.
Honestly his stare into the camera makes it look 1000x worse for him. He knows.
"As you can see clearly in the video, I moved the VIBRATION remote in order to get a cookie. You DUMBASS!"   I already see his manipulation of the situation lmao liar's are so predictable.
Clearly hes just a control freak to the nth degree.  Has the dog just pinned in the corner all day.  Fuckin weirdo.
This won't drag him down.  His fans will let him get away with anything just like Twitch does.
Wow what a dumbass
He takes shock jock to a whole new level.
Hassans cooked, HE IS FUCKING COOKED.😂
Hasan is like Pirate Software if he was a terrorist and shocked dogs
If this dude had power, you know millions of people would be under his abuse. Typical commie filth
I’ve been reporting his videos for animal abuse
just a terrorist lover that made his money by rage baiting American citizens while he makes money off of capatilism.   AKA   fucktard terrorist cock sucking cuck.
Why am I watching this
Arrest him honesly, track anyone who makes that product purchase and flag them, take their pet and arrest them. Or let them wear the collar for 3 years and see how they like it.
Bro we need the Candyman to Destroy Hassan.
Drone strike him 😂
Lmao, caught red handed.
Dude was a terrorism encouraging piece of shit for a while now and it took animal abuse to get the majority against him, fair enough that would convince anyone
There was one way out of it. He could have simply been honest. He could have said that _"Yes, it's a shock collar, but I have disabled the shock feature and only use vibration. That's why there's tape on it."_ Some people would have believed it, some wouldn't. Instead he chose to go with "It's not a shock collar at all", which is demonstrably false and only leads to one conclusion. He's lying, about that and probably all of it.
Hasan could rocket launcher that dog and people would still make up excuses for him.
Oops!!
lol what a piece of shit.
We can now legally crucify Poki not only for supporting this monster but also for firing her whole staff just to virtue signal. The intercontinental boomerang of dildos returns!
Literally caught in 4k
The funniest part is a Muslim celebrating Christmas.😅
just some narc traits probably haha
hasan is such a sly and deceitful dog,
This is PirateSoftware incident on steroids
Alhamdullah Bingo, we got him
Always knew there was something about this guy from when I first seen him debate Andrew Tate years ago 😂 clearly I was right
I use those collars on my dog too. Idc what ANYONE thinks about it and neither should the dude in the clip. It’s his dog and he can train it however he wants, just like I do. People need to stop being so worried about what others think.
Boomers still think Trump was a federal agent. Of course they believe shockgate
That doggo enjoys being around different people. It means he can't get shocked for a time being.
Somebody should report him to his state police for animal cruelty.
Fucking knew it
Pirate Software 2.0
His useful idiot will defend him an make 1000 excuses lol
He’s a muslim…..  he’s a commie…. He’s a narcissist….  He’s a liar….. He’s a champagne socialist millionaire…. He’s an anchor baby….      All these things are facts…. How ppl listen to this anti American piece of human garbage, is startling
He knows it. this sociopath just seeks attention and he really doesnt practice what he preach.
how is he not in jail?
POS human
shock collars are legal where he lives, right? why didn't he just own it instead of lying, he's clearly not good at cleaning up after himself to get away with a lie. (I'm glad they're illegal in most decent places, cmon catch up USA)
I couldn't even care less if he uses a shock training collar. Using it to keep his dog stationary for hours on end is a bit weird, but i don't really care. I just don't get why he's lying about it.
Still doesn't matter, his slaves will defend him anyway, but good job random chatter
Liberals with their moral relativism
He never admits he is wrong because, in his own words, he is a propagandist.   It is safer to assume he is ALWAYS wrong.
human terrorist to puppy terrorist! 🔫🐶 Whats next man? I❤Winning! 💋
*Hasan looks like he's an al-Qaida Terrorist.* *I'm not surprised if he hurts animals for fun.* 👿 *You can see it—this dog has never been happy.* *Breaks my heart.* 😭
Valkyrae defending him is truly cancel worthy
😂😂😂
1:19 asmon is going to eat those words one day lmaooo. Im no Hasan viewer but Asmon is the exact same and if bro has a scandal he will never live this down
If you search this, the first result on Google is an article from Out Magazine that defends this human piece of garbage. 🤮
He's streaming _right now_ and Kaya is mysteriously absent...
So people call out hasan for using a shock collar on his dog but hasan confesses to using a vibrator on his dog… I don’t know what’s worse… 😂
Yesterday Palmer Luckey said that he's willing to donate $100K to any Hasan's charity if he sends him the collar so the guys at iFixit tear it down to check if it is a vibrating or shocking collar
When he said it was just a vibration collar, you can clearly see in the picture of the remote that he removed the prongs and covered up where they attach with black tape.
Why the actual fuck do you get a dog if the simple act of it moving through the room annoys you so much that you buy a shock collar... That poor dog is terrified of him.
Holy crap dude he is such a cooked sick little dog abuser. hahahahahahah
Amazing how much effort they put to portray Hasan as "normal".
His name IS Hassan and he mistreat his pet, what a surprise the muslim Leftie IS fucking garbage
Hasan's Dog is Shocked
I mean tbh why do I care? Just seems like more important things to focus on
ANd these actual troglodytes still watch him.
Talk about a personality disorder
caught lying in 4k 😂
Shock collars for working dogs arent bad imo. But for a pet that you are just trying to keep in frame of your camera for a prop is definitely wrong.
LELW
he always been a piece of shit
i would be more trusting if these people did the news
This couldn't have happen to a better person
Need someone to make a video of him and the "ThunderBringer" song playing in the background.
He's (Hasan) really such a waste of oxygen... it's astonishing.
I'd take those odds to Vegas
Bruh the Internet is CURRENTLY super sluthing your ass right now.   Even if you thought you were in the right with the training, and just thought "the Internet wouldn't understand"   The amount of cooked your brain has to be to not hide the remote in literally the exact same place you reached for it when all this started is levels of acoustic that I would expect of wings of redemption. Like you are lolcow levels of dumb at this point
Is over lmao
That dog needs to be rescued. The beautiful baby needs to be taken away from him and rehomed with someone normal and nice, who will love her and who knows how to keep and treat a dog.
FREE KAYA!
He’s disgusting
He could have just said "Oh, shock collars are bad? Let me look this up", made a show about reading about them on steam, then take it off the dog on stream. He  ould have ran his own pr and it wouldn't have been an issue. Instead he took a page out of the Trump book and lied about it
hasan bullsht
I hate people who abuse animals the most
Thats his mute button bro
comment
The way he looks up at the camera like a 12 year old caught with his hand in the cookie jar lmfao
Now we know why he loves to watch and promote terrorist propaganda -- he's practicing torture with his own dog.
Proven beyond reasonable doubt. Any other doubt is unreasonable copium brain rot doubt.
It’s messed up but some people do shock their dogs. The funny part is the blatant lies. Do you think he lies about anything else?
where I can buy this for my wife xD? btw fck that poseur
The *Dharius Daniels podcast?😂
Jail him.
This entire situation would have been exponentially smaller if Hasan admitted that he shocked the dog and it was wrong for him to do so in that situation.
Fuck Hasan. Free the dog.
where are all the hasan freak fans now??? they will still follow hasan rather than admit they were wrong because you have to be a certain kind of person to support and watch hasan.
Break his fingers.
Bro I don't like this dude but I've been defending him all over the fucking internet 😂😂😂 I've been saying it's a vibration remote 😂
Caught 😂😂😂
I’m sorry but idk how this is defendable by his supporters now. Yes I do get “just because he has it doesn’t mean he uses the shock function”  I do 100%   The issue here is how he’s gone from saying he doesn’t have a shock collar on her, to “it only has a vibrate function and flashlight” To ok I got one but I don’t use the shock button and I dont have the remote near me inside” To “I’m just pressing the button to unlock the gate”  To this “hey gotta get this out of the frame”  😂😂😂.  I’ll say it again even to give him the benefit of the doubt saying Kaia yelping in the video was just a coincidence or something, Hassan has done NOTHING to make himself look innocent. Every video and clip goes against him and makes him look bad.  At this point he did this on purpose to troll us or I think he’s just forgotten how the internet works.
Isn't there a RSPCA in USA that could get on his case?
I can't believe isreal swapped out his dogs vibrating collar with a shock one and then planted the remote for it just in frame of a different camera angle
All you can do is laugh at this point, bro is so cooked.
Its crazy how this tard can support terrorist and call for violence and there's only a few calling him out. But now shocking a dogg is going to far and crosses the line and now everyone is calling him out. What a bunch of clowns.

😂😂😂😂omfg
people who dont admit the small things they do are hiding bigger things
Hasan the terrorist is cruel to animals?
AHAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣
some people care more for animals than their taxes going to finance the suffering going on Gaza
Really small? Dude is shocking his dog for just standing up! Imagine what hes doing behind close doors!
The lying sack of sh1t.
Get him!!! 👎 ⚡️ 🐕
Peter Griffin just wants to talk with him
Free Kaya!
Has anyone reported this to the authorities yet? Surely there's enough evidence to atleast make someone consider helping this poor dog?
first video is all it took, now this shit is just getting out of hand!
How is he that dumb that he cant think to hide it before lmaooooo  It was obvious from the start that the dog doesnt even clip her leg at all and that hes been guilty. This is the undeniable evidence though and we'll see what excuse he comes up with this time lmaoo
No way the terrorist abusive sak of shit lied??? OMG
if hasan murdered his dog on stream i don't think his fans would care, nor would twitch even suspend him lol
From the dog bed to the trees Hassan’s dog should be free
Not beating the allegations
Jagermeister is gonna have a field day with this, whoever that is.
The frustrating thing about dealing with (or witnessing) such cases is knowing that we will never get the confession from the concerned narcissist bitch, nor will we get them exposed live in a sting operation or something like that.  Oh, The urge to get these!!
why does he celebrate Christmas, isn`t he a leftist muslim?
Finally some good news! I'm so done of this libs getting away with everything and the ones who oppose to them are the evil ones.. Go s*ck a massive piece of wood..
1:18 just like Pirate unfortunately
hasan: all the evidence you have seen is fake it was made with AI by the people that hate me
"they're not sending their best" Donald J Trump
he needs to go
_cover up story_ *do u hear him speaking about epstein anymore?  they are ALL different sides of the same f***ing distraction coin*
True heroes out there combing through endless hours of Hasan streams to find these clues. I just imagine they'd have to watch it on mute and 8x speed or something.
Word of note: Hasan owns a female dog AND he's also an eligible bachelor.
THE DUDE IS A TERRORIST SUPPORTER!!
Noooo! You people don't get it!! Hamas Piker MUST keep his dog from wandering off camera or else the Zionist Jews win!!!
I'm not really sure what the controversy is?  These are sold and recommend by dog trainers and vets.  If it was animal abuse wouldn't it be illegal to even get e-collars?  Be mad at stores and government regulations then?     One of the first conversations I had with my vet about behavioral training was to get a collar that has tons as well as slight shocks so you can use the tone first then the shock second if they ignore it.   Shit you can still buy choke chains with teeth at PetCo.  I find that to be a bit crueler personally but society doesn't.    Is this over sensitivity why I so many modern dog owners don't even leash their dogs anymore? I worked at a state park with clear leash laws and almost daily we would have visitors at the park with a lose dog running around.  Leash and train your animals people for everyone's sake
Save the dog, please. Anyone living in there.
Nothings gonna happen
You could say, these are...  shocking news.
Anyone know where this guy lives? For science of course
The problem about lying is that the truth will always come out eventually
And.. Hasan Career is over...
It seems like Kaya is unmotivated to stay in frame for the stream, let's motivate her by giving her a controlled shock ⚡
He would never allow it to be shown, but i GUARUNTEE U he hates his dog now and probably blames this all on her.  Prly treats her like shit now if thats anymore possible.
Asmongold will still sit on the fence and say “gee golly gosh it looks bad but i dunno 🤷‍♂️ “
Idk what the problem is Asmon literally kills his pet cockroaches
The good ole Streisand effect 🤣
Of ALL the things this absolute Nimrod has done. Why is this the hill he dies on? Its like pirate software all over again.
Lying is part of the culture .
Justice for kaya
Commenter: Zyn my ahhh. Be careful what you wish for.
Kaya villain arc tactical nuke: INCOMING
Save kaya
Dont put it past me to use a shock collar. I dont feel the need to lie. And i dont feel like its abuse if its used properly. Dont have any dogs tho
What do we expect, don't Muslims believe Dogs scare away Angels? I'm not fuckin religious at all but no shit he wouldn't care about shocking a poor defenseless dog. They are beasts of burden, not companions.
wouldn't it be great if his 15 minutes of inciting violence and hurling baseless insults are up?
I never knew these things existed... how is it legal to sell torture devices for pets? This is insane!
my dog stepped on a shock collar
Free Kaya
We've been doing it wrong guys. We should have talked about the dogs in gaza instead of the children.
That dog needs a good home.  It's stuck in hell.
Classic narcissist behavour never admitting youre wrong
Deport
Hey Asmoncuck, actually condemn the guy instead of riding the fence for views and giggling like a little schoolgirl. "ooh he abuse animals, me exploit for views and laugh at memes!" You bitchboy cuckoid, actually take a stand instead of playing it for views because you think you might have to work with Hasan and his people in the future and don't want to be too harsh about it. Stop looking at it through the lens of a creator and be a human being if you're capable.
As much as I don't like Hasan, I don't believe shock collars are inherently bad, I think they can be useful. Most of the time. it's not really a shock, it feels like a touch. Every touch is technically an electric current. The collars are used interrupt behavior not wanted. Of course these can be abused but what's weird is that he doesn't hold his ground as to why he uses one. He can literally just explain how it works and why he does it, but instead he just denies it all together which just makes him a huge coward and makes him look really bad. Nothing new from Hasan though.
im not defending hasan or anything, i dont really know anything about him,, i just know theres been between asmon and him, but i wanna objectively point out that the mini educator lines of shock collars is not dog abuse. its a proper tool for training, this is for remote training cuz ultimately u want ur dog to listen to u even when not leashed. with that being said, it CAN be used to abuse dogs if ppl decide to turn it up to like 100 and just shock the dog for no reason, but by that logic, anything can be used to abuse dogs, so its not really an argument at all. i just wanna defend this tool, its the ppl that abuse dogs, not tools. shock collars, prong collars, they are all proper tools, some of u oughtta learn to use it, cuz u dont train ur dogs
Shocked his dog. Lied about shocking his dog. Fabricated evidence of his innocence. Defamed people who pointed out his lies.
at this point i think Hasan tries how far he can goes.
it's doesn't change a thing, he still not gonna be punished for being terrorists supporter
Its so clear he did it i would bet everything i have on it
bro you can NOT be a streamer and think you can sneak something passed this audience lmaoo shoutout to whoever did the digging for this
What is people that continues to support him saying? i'm curious
bro you really riding this dudes junk like you got the hots for him or something?  i dont think he swings that way but i guess you can have your dreams right
Hassan and his friend literally say on a faze stream to lacy that they train their dogs with shock collars weirdos
I don't understand, did he abuse the dog? Yes, he's a horrible human being, but how did he treat the dog? He always wants the dog to stay in its corner and shocks if otherwise? If that is not the case, why is everyone so riled up?
Shock collars do have vibrate modes, not just shock. And the shock is like a static electric zap.   They are the best training tools for dogs ever made.
The Dynamite always goes, BOOM!
Has he actually been reported for animal cruelty yet?
cook and more cook
I hope this story never ends, seeing the downfall of Hasan has me super entertained 🍿 😄
Disgusting
Finally asmon distracted from his garbage political takes
I'd just say its my vibrator controller at this point
the Islamic TURK terrorist supporter also abuses dogs in plain sight what a shock. it's would have been way more shocking if his uncle didn't have a media organization named after a bunch of sadistic islamists that murdered every dog in constantenopple
SHOCKING NEWS: The collar is electric but mostly peaceful. Kaya did not shock herself.
That's because he's a fucking moron.
It’s because he’s a massive pos ! In every aspect of life
Hasan Abudadi The Animal Abuser
Honestly this shit don’t even matter it’s a dog he’s not raping it at least
Hasan: “The Houthi are luffy, and I am Enel.”
It’s so joever.
Christmas tree?!  What does Luffy think about that?
The terrorist sympathizer likes shock dollars, who would have guessed.
how can you explain that? i bet hasan can XD
Are shock collars illegal in Hasan's state?
Has anyone reported him to authorities yet? I'm not familiar with animal rights laws in the US, but he isn't providing fresh drinking water at all times, letting her stand and stretch or go for toilet breaks for hours on end, regularly (maybe daily, I dont know his stream schedule) He'd deny shocking her and maybe be successful in lying and  manipulating himself out of that (unless he's shocked her so many times its caused an open wound) but could Kaya be legally removed from him with this evidence? They should at least check on her.
why asmon not listen when hasan says - his dog is literally a slave and he does whatever he want? this is viral on x now
"it's just a vibration remote you chuds" ok why does he hide it
I littekry don’t see the problem with shocking your dog to get them to listen I did it for ever and my dog does everything I say and still loves me
It's about, like if he can't be honest on stuff like this, how can he be trusted on even more bigger or serious topics? Hell, was he even honest on the things in the past even?
He so cooked
So this is how Hans Niemann won
PETA has left the chat
FREE THAT DOG!!!
He doesn't want to admit it because he knows that people hate shock collars. He still doesn't think he's wrong for using one though. So he doubles down. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
I dont get it, how has nobody simply called 911 on this?  In the UK he'd be getting rinsed by authorities for this, one of the very few positives i have for my home country right now lol. Very, very few.
It's like dsp getting caught jacking off
I thought shock collars were banned in most places.
Yeah he keeps this up he's going to get canceled so hard unless he starts to grow two brain cells and stops responding to The criticism which I highly doubt it
You need to do a video on WHO TF IS PROTECTING THIS POS?
I hope he gets perma banned so I don’t watch him eat on stream ever again.
I know for sure off stream he probably hits that dog and electrocutes it for no reason other than he’s angry at something and blames the dog
Again, Hasan needs to be in prison. Between the constant incitement of violence and terrorism and the multiple instances of animal abuse, there is no excuse for him to be walking free.
We didn't need this to know this guys a scumbag
Hasan does indeed hide the abuse from his friends that's why he wanted their testimonials so badly. He thought it up a long time ago.
Some people don't deserve a pet if they don't actually care about it, I just lost my old girl Grizzly a few months ago I Never in my life would put a Shock collar on any of my dogs, This guy needs to be hooked up to the Electric Chair!!!
he just needs to say he did it, the gaslighting is insane
Theres also the fact that Hassan reacted instantly to the dog getting shock lol.
Put him on the world's most dumbest criminals
13% of shock collars commit 80% of paw clips.
How soon until the tearful “I’m learning” apology video?
Free Kaya, from the collar to the shocking spree
My dogs didn't need their shock collars after 8 months old, and they didn't wear them in the house. 4 american bulldogs and a mini pinscher chihuahua, which is literally the honey badger of dogs in my opinion
As s communist, Liberals like Hasan Piker are thorns in our side, leading people away from real revolutionary dissent in favor of the dead end of the Republican/Democrat Party. Thank you for taking him down.
just kill him. that easier than trying to save the dog first
Dogtober 7th traumatized us all.
Bruh some have nothing to do in life then just look for shit on others, im not a fan of Hassan but my god move the fk on. There is more then this delusional fk on the web.
I watched this video and now am getting dog collar ads all over my phone and I don't even have a dog.
Can’t imagine the hostages in gaza were treated better than Hasan’s dog.
And then I saw the pathetic pseuds in r/SubredditDrama call these people digging this shit up "no life losers, they don't have better things to do than find this?"  Yeah. They don't. Neither do you. Otherwise you wouldn't be on Reddit. You're all unemployed.
Why is this a bad thing?
I honestly can’t stand either of you.  Both of you seem to be really far detached from reality imo.
Another plane has hit the tower LOL
Hasan is such a douche and piece of garbage of a human being it's incredible how he still has a platform
a shock collar is not abuse if you only use it when necessary my 3 dogs have ones that do beep vibrate and if necessary a shock im not 100% sure what happened but the collar wouldn't be the problem unless he was shocking for no reason then yea thats an issue
Turns out the glove does fit after all
Hasan is just a trash human and everyone who follows him.
Christmas in a commies home and in October?
Put a man like this into power over other people. What do you think he would do ?
Who’s hasan.
Hasan the E-Wizard. NOW ⚡️
I wonder what his dick suckers will say now
it just get worse and worse. he shouldnt have lied about it and it would be over by now hahahha
Yall are tripping about a shock collar?
at this point I can only thing that he is doing it on purpose to get some attention
Ugh ok seems I was wrong, he may love his dog but may also be shocking him for obedience … omg I thought I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt, but still proved so many of us wrong
This is the psychotic nature of this new generation
He has statues of dogs but yet doesn’t love his own
Never liked Hasan. Idk why people like him especially people I used to watch. Like the hypocrisy is astounding. Glad I stopped watching that side of streamers.
I would say get the RSPCA to save the dog but we all know how that would end.   WHEN WILL THE SHOCKING END!
Same face i do when i get caught doing something I shouldnt xd

"Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect towards himself and others" - Fyodor Dostoevsky
asmonds dad would have loved this and i think hes moving MOUNTAINS to help aid in hasans downfall from the other side (might not be true whatsoever, but its a fun thought to think about)
if bro owned his actions he would be so respected but his go too is gaslight everytime makeing him unbelievable even when its not a big deal.
OH! reddit is allowing you to say Hasan again?!
Let's all remember when Asmongold tried making Candace Owens seem crazy with a CUT OUT CLIP of her JOKING. JUST like the leftist did to Charlie Kirk... Literally Asmongold you should address this MISHAP, because you just did to Candace. EXACTLY what you complained others did to Charlie...
What would the Hasan defenders say this time?
Are people still defending him.
And his orbiters will still defend him.
I'd bet my left nut....
Free Kaya.

Disgusting animal abusing scumbag
Hasan piker is the zodiac killer
>brown commie tortures dog  More news at 11.
Now his fan base is gonna say yall are bots and Israel is the real problem
He has a dog
There’s no way this is the fall of Hassan, after all the shit he’s done
May Jesus get that dog away from him. And may Jesus heal everyone. Amen and amen
What a cowardly dude
Irony is if he took the time to train his dog properly, all he would need is his voice or a clicker noise. This isn't some impossible task only by professionals, most dog owners train their dog to listen to them. Resorting to torture tactics is a sign of complete failure and utter laziness, on shock collars that will no doubt be banned in future (and is already banned in many countries).
lmao i feel like the situation wouldnt be so bad if he simply didnt lie about it
I like how all these streamers act like they respect each other but the moment one of them gets in trouble or gets cancelled, they do anything to drown that person and make content on that. I heard about the streamer he is referring to... I think they are both pieces of s**t
can't wait to see what the devout Hassan followers say.
All these pussies in the chat crying theres a shock collar is crazy its legal and the dog ainr effected by it calm down and cancel yourselfs from life
What’s mind boggling is now his die-hard supporters will start saying it delivers such a small amount of electricity that it’s morally justifiable. You can’t talk to these people.
I wonder what stuff he’s done that he hasn’t been caught for. The wrong people get famous lol
Another episode of: I critizise animal abuse, while I still abuse and exploit animals with my food choices
I’ve seen enough take the dog off him, absolutely vile behaviour poor little dog man I pray he/she is okay
only thing people who follow the fake religion of "peace and love" treat worse than dogs are their women
so why is he hiding that he is using a dog trainer? cause those sell on amazon XD. just bought my mom one so her dogs stops barking. it doesn't hurt the dog it's just negative reinforcement.
The call the fuckin thing the educator 😂
hASSan somehow, by the skin of his teeth, found ANOTHER way to get even worse. Idk how he keeps doing it, but he does. What an absolutely disgusting human being.
The dude had actual murdering grapist pirates and terroristas on his show giving them a glazing, but it’s the use of a low grade TENS machine on his dog that loses his audience?  My grandma was 70/80 when she was prescribed a tens machine, a dog with thick fur with a low output version of the same thing is gonna be fine.  The people Hassan’s guests of honor ended, not so much.
anyone denying the allegations doesn't live in this dimension
someone take that dog of him!!! save the dog!
you people have absolutely nothing in your brains
Bro treats his dog like Broly
Does anybody have Asmon's stream playlist?
Its a shame we cant go after all the money he's earned from animal cruelty - anyone know what the chances are of a lawsuit being successful in this situation?
Narcissists never accept blame.
RELEASE THE KAYA FILES.
Call peta lol
That remote was for hit vibrating butt plug. Wrong conspiracy
Just like Memere always said, “Truth will out.”
Hasan has always been a virtue signaling dbag
Streamers never cease to amaze me with their pettiness, you are all the same
LOL!!! Wow, caught in 4k, literally! He even looked up at the camera! what a freaking goober! I hope everyone on the internet can now see what a monster hasan actually is. If he's doing this kind of stuff to his own dog JUST FOR THE SAKE OF OPTICS, what would he do to people if he ever actually got any real power? dude hates abuse of power... unless he's the one in power! I'm not a fan of shaming people, except for people like this, this frigger deserves to be pointed at and laughed off the internet, so everyone knows not to trust him
Someone please Liberate Kaya !
Is now finally over ? Because i see 3 videos refering , its finally over . This time is finally or its gona be anorher finally video ?
He is a textbook narcissist. That's basically it. He also happens to be ideologically possessed in a certain way that is.....questionable, or maybe even treasonous to the USA.
That's it. We got him boys.
I heard he has a butt plug that vibrates by remote as well
I see Hasan has his slaves cleaning his house.
i hope meatcanyon does a animation on the situation
Can we just sic PETA on him, already? We're getting tired of this.
imagine hating "opressors" so much you become one
Oh look he getting more attention!! Nothing else... 😂😂
One weird trick Hasan doesn't want you to know.
Confirmed: Socialists hate dogs
yeah, looking up the device in question - the E-Collar ET-300 Mini Educator - it does not make it any better. Its just a "high" quality shock collar still and at least in my country, e-collar fall under the same law and are prohibit.   It actually over for real.
Wouldn’t it poetic justice that if the dog he has been abusing … is actually the one who brings his streaming career crumbling down 😊
Bro looked at his own camera the same way thieves in grocery stores stare at cameras :D Amazing  *I worked security in a grocery store
Let be real here if he say he did use a shock collar to get the dog listen and admit to it, it will stop right there for the investigation because we know he is an abusive person but then he lie and so here come the can of worm being open 😂 what more could he hide from us 😂.
Hasan minions will say this is fake😂😂
I bet he blames the dog for all of this.
His fans don't care
I wish it turned out that that was his remote for his butt plug
The most peaceful remote
I thought Turks were known for treating animals well?
Meanwhile America also have a felon in White House and a war criminal as a guest in your congress.
FROM THE BEDROOM TO THE TV HASANS DOG WILL BE FREE
Hassan such a veasel 😂
This is the truth of islam 😂
I don't find any of it funny , shock collars should only be used on animals in extreme situations....
Who created such device in the first place?
It also looks like the dog lives with that collar on. It’s also so tight you can see the impression around the neck. Looking like a forgotten junkyard dog chained up.
Why hasn't he canceled? I only see jokes on him. Where are his cancel culture peers?
BRO IT'S OVER
Hasan can’t admit about being wrong about anything because then he’s after to admit to being wrong about literally everything.
I found it funny that his camera set up after he shocked his dog shows every part of his room except the corner where he keeps the remote. Now I see he used to have it set up differently. So damn guilty. Caught red handed.
90% of "dog training" is literally just mild dog torture. Trying to manipulate their behavior into something that is unnatural and easier for you to handle.   The entire point of Hassan training his dog is so that it acts like it has a lobotomy if he's not giving it attention.  So he doesn't have to get off his chair and interact with the dog at all when it's doing something that pisses him off.  Instead, he just nukes the Dogs personality and zest for life with "training", until it's a soulless lobotomized sack of fur who does not move from it's bed while Hassan streams.
A thing iv realized I my 25 years of life yes power corrupts and that's for everyone but liberals really go over board, all the censorship under Biden, Joseph stallion, mao, they always abuse their power to such a shock extent all under the guise of liberation, equality and so on, STOP BELIEVING THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE YOU F*CK!NG MORONS, if someone says there a good person there's a 99% chance there a asshole, these people can't help but tell on themselves just listen you sheep
caught in HD 1080x1920
The unemployed are feasting on
Collar me shocked
Hasan is disgusting
I think Hasan should put that on his own neck. -- that dog barely has wrong behaviour so far I know. -- that device is only ment to deal with heavy problematic animals. -- it's just totaly abused by Hasan. -- Has that dog on video done anything crazy yet apart from being shocked by Hasan?!?!
For as big a guy as Hasan is, it's unusual he would need a shock collar to train his dog. And if it's an issue with the breed of dog not being compatible with his lifestyle, he should just give it up for adoption to someone whose lifestyle fits that of the dog.
He looks at the camera. He knows.
Moves it off camera because he knows it's morally wrong and doesn't wanna get caught
He sees the remote and was like "Ope. That doesn't fit the narrative."
Why hasn't he thrown it away, wtf?
His name is "Hasan", what more do you expect?? LMAO
Typical peft
Expected behavior from the performative male final boss
So now all the orbiters, shills and stans will tell us how this is definitely the best way to train a doge.
Funny how people are also overlooking that Valkyrae who defended Hasan was right there by the remote... so either she's blind, or a liar.
God asmongold looks so disgusting
Somebody call the Animal Protection Service on Hasan and she'll be saved.
One day, that poor, scared dog will get tired of his crap, and attack Hasan. The sad thing? Everybody will blame the dog for the action, but never the build-up to why the dog attack, the weeks, and months of abuse.
Hasan treats his Dog like Communists treat people in general.
DFuck is this comment section?!
The two collar solution
There’s no longer a genocide in Gaza people are allowed to see these things now. 😂
i dont find the video, or the comments made funny at all ...its sad while you all joke around, that dog suffers ...so yeah, keep making jokes online, its very helpful
It looks like ET-300 phoned home.
1:18 this is a dark, terrifying characteristic that most sociopaths possess.
What do expect from a follower of the "religion of peace?" They basically think 🐕  and 🐖  are unclean animals that have no souls...
The Camera was on the Whole Time😂😂😂😂
How often its actually over
It's over... - title used multiple times, and yet, nothing's over
it's fucking over hahaha
We are not dealing with the sharpest knife in the drawer here.
Differnt topic, isnt he muslim? Why are they putting up a christmas tree in the video?
Hasan's followers all wear shock collars 🤣
Canceled
Always hated this guy. What a fucking douchebag.
but ..but ..GAZA GENOCIDE!!!
How in the fuck is this dude not in jail already??
Here we go again. People been saying that for months.😂
The inventor and the users of this device are evil.
SOMEHOW & yet again, another TOTALLY UNSURPRISING FIND that HASANABI is a PATHOOLOGICAL LIAR gaslighting everyone despite being caught red handed becauae he has the brain size if a LITERAL APPLE SEED and then comoressed , yeast infected air Resifing In his Skull where a nrqin should be.  EHAT A SURPRISE HASAN-PIKER is using the "ET-300 MINI EDUCATOR" on a Dog , to enforce a 4'x3' space , with no water, no food and THE ONLY PEOPER THING ALLOWED IS TO LAY DOWN, ALWAYS, like a goooood little gingerbread girl named POKIMANE !
How can you be a fan of this a**hole when he's lying straight to your face?! It boggles my mind to imagine someone who enjoys watching Hasan He'll cry like a baby when he is canceled I want him to cry harder
A lot of rightwingers realizing how Trump operates now 😂😂😂
Here’s an idea, how about you sheep stop talking and watching this dumbass. Instead of fueling his ego every single day.
Hasan is a terrible terrorist
He is just another Pirate Software, cant ever be wrong and so even when he is caught a little white lie he will stick to it until the bitter end.
Hassan, do us a favor and wear the dog collar yourself! You need to wake up and disappear from the internet! 😒
This has to go viral in order for there to be consequences. Otherwise nothing will happen
The Turks and animals… Never good
and so what? Literally nothing is going to happen
This is the worst human being
Get him, now!
🤦
🤷‍♀️  Typical Mooselim, 👹Tuscen Raider, 🐐Goat loving Sympathizer 😂
i think asmon is pretty dumb... but i like him because he made mistakes... and OWNS it. Even as a dumb person... with all due respect. But hassan, is just dumb, and a liar.   And even if i agree with most points politicaly... I can not, dont hate him as a person.
bro stop giving this stupid muzz coverage.  hopefully he will kill himself and the issue will be solved
why would he lie??
Why hasn’t someone stepped in to remove that poor furbaby from the pos house?
Hassan's a really smart guy.
Boom! There it is... CAUGHT! what more evidence do we need? "It's a zen, trust me bro'
Reposting a comment I saw on the last video: Kaia is living under Sharia law
Im not happy til he gets an animal cruelty charge
the meat canyon hasan video is gonna be a banger
Probably, he treats women in the same way btw
something tells me it's not " over " snd i expect to see another dozen YouTubers uploading the same damn title over and over until its actually " over " or " done "
Pirate software just with a little more charisma
Why is bro setting up for Christmas in the middle of October
☪️ancer of the universe 🐷
Asmongold and Hasan are both hot trash, but seeing all of this about Hasan is actually confirming he is the worst.
Asmongold .. If you get to see this ..  I'm 1.70cm 65 kg /  37 years .. been working since 14 old. Put me in a cage with Hasan !  I'm willing to travel anywhere on this planet just to beat the sht out him !
They should take all of his animals and he should be banned from ever owning animals again. At the very least.
He is so narcissistic he even couldnt stop himself from abusing kaya to save his careeer as it would hurt his ego. He thought that from now on for sure he would get away with it
Now imagine if this "For the people" guy gets any form of governmental power lol Bro is Netenyahu and Kaya  is a Palestinian
no amount of proof will ever be enough sadly
Even if you use those collars for training dogs' behavior you never use them on the dog while in the house when the dog should be able to relax (but obviously cant). He is a wicked person just like his uncle Cenk.
Lyin Abbibi...
It was always stupid to say he didn’t. Watch the video again and you can literally hear him set down the remote before he pulls his hand back into frame. You hear the plastic clack on the desk 1 second after she yelps.
Mr President…. A 2nd shock has hit the collar.
tomorrows video title: "It's definitely over" day after video title: "Now its definitely over" one week from now: "Hasan is done"
Lying Ted. sheesh
really shows the uneducated state the worlds in when half this comment section is making fun of an ongoing genocide. what does that have to do with anything in these clips?
That’s straight up animal abuse. Someone save that poor dog
Kaya: *Moves an inch*  Hassan: BY GODS LIGHT I SMITE YOU
average muslims country IQ is below 80, just saying
If you can’t admit your faults your virtue signaling loses credibility.
Lying sack of sh
Piece of shit is finally proven to be a piece of shit. Not surprising
It's mostly peaceful animal abuse.
Dude it doesnt matter, the fans these people have are just gonna say "nuhuh" forever until theyre right
Guilt, thy name is Piker.
He knows it's wrong
what an idiot.... thinking you can hide something when you have 50k eyeballs on you.......
“He never admits he’s wrong, even about little things”. Wonder who else is like that ? Trump maybe ?
This terrorist needs a visit from Chippy
Always assume Hasan is lying
Get rid of this guy already. Deplatform.
Now think about the denial with the tape... He taped over the collar and then says YOU are crazy for noticing it....
Everyone yapping about animal abuse whilst happily eating a tortured animal from a slaughterhouse 🤣
Why did he look up
now we wait till "John Wick" arrives
CAUGHT  (for the 16th time?)
bro hes literally doing it on purpose to view farm at this point. All publicity is good publicity
It's for the vibrator in his ass guys I swear
It's for the vibrator in his ass guys I swear
It's the shock collar of peace.
It's so over
He's so worthless
On a side note why is the "Muslim" and Christian/western hater celebrating Christmas? 😂
how wil valkyrae and pokiamne defend this? maybe they ask advice from charlietheconspiracist, how to deal with it. or maybe slugwig, the boneless how to sneak away and fencesit on this one real hard.
That's the most guilty look up a human can have 😂
Hasan really is just that stupid.  He might be lucky to break 75 IQ
The women are completely controlled, but the dog is a bridge too far? 🤔
I guess Valkyrae didn't see that one coming.
Nailed it, I called it having dogs that size myself it takes quite a bit to make them cry like that. Poor Kaya
His stans are so adamant to stand by him that he could quite literally in the middle of the day, killing a sitting politician, and he would find some way to defend it or deny it despite there being footage and proof, they'd stand with him. This guy is somehow above the law. I remain convinced at this point that he's some sort of protected plant with immunity or some shit.
Not a clue who the guy is other than drama on YouTube. Someone needs to call him out so he shows the device on his stream where he’s got no time to look for a dummy object or similar shaped item. Guarantee he will say he’s lost it or it broke, if the guy streams for a living the shock collar is obviously to shut his dog up if barking which is cruel as f.  Don’t deny it and not provide evidence. Just damage control
"Ohh no, No, my key fob for my lamboghatti is just obserdly large, you wouldn't understand because you own a dodge, not a Lamboghatti veyroghini"😂
its pointless brining up more evidence against him Smart people are already convinced  Stupid people will continue to ignore it
This Roach is cooked
Always knew in my bones that Hassan was a piece of shit
Somehow, Palpatine returned. 😂
Okay, Hasan might be shocking his dog but here is why it's a good thing.
Nothing will happen. Remember, pokimane and other streamers support this nonsense.
Yet another instance of Hasan fans being left to look stupid for blindly defending their streamer. How many of these do we actually need to get them to stop bro 😂
What a clown lmfao
What an actual piece of shit, not only did he do it but he bold faced lied about it to all of his fans. That's the kind of person he really is.
If he admits to wrongdoing, then CNN are gonna have to address it since they endorse each other. But we can't have that happen can we
What amazes me is that the persons that are present there will certainly say, that Kaya is well treated, meanwhile when they are there, he's hidding the remote of the shock collar. He knowns it's bad. He knowns that if they find out its bad.   Wonder if the invited people are genuinely idiots that protect him or just on to it and protect him...
The world would be a better place if he'd never been born, or if he just stopped consuming oxygen.
You're actually obsessed with eachother, why not get married? 🥰🥰🥰
What you expect from a muslim
Hasan is having his pirate software downfall
Petition to have him wear the collar next stream and chat has control of the remote to 'educate' him.
“Why doesn’t he just admit he’s wrong?”   Cuz he’s a narcissist. He can’t be wrong, that’d shatter his privileged reality.
disgusting to do that to a peacefull animal ...
Busted... ISREAL PLANTED IT!!! I KNEW IT XD
Over a million views.....
The vibration collar has literally the same remote...😭 Look up for example EDUCATOR PG-300 collar - it's literally the same remote ;_; cmon ;_;
Good thing Trump passed the first federal laws against animal abuse
Can’t wait to hear the new excuses that the “he’d never do that” fans will have .
Find a clean clip, 25% playback speed. There's a high frequency noise starting right before Kaya yelps, and ending shortly after. It's very subtle, but it's definitely there. Doesn't happen in any other part of the clip too. High voltage generators produce a lot of electrical noise that can be picked by every bit of audio equipment (there's shielding, but it can only do so much, that's why it's quieter).  Small DC motors don't, they have lower audible frequency and there's very small chance the mic would pick it up from ~2-3m away. You can lie and hide all you want, noise will always sell you out.
Of course he lied, did you believe him in the first place? Not me
Hassan uses Shock.   _It's super effective!_
left wing guys kinda forgot they must be for peace and all good in life. use gun, threat to kill someone, shock his dog, and always lie about all. Leftties you found a g good guy to support
Who was questioning whether it was a shock collar? Was instantly obvious , selective outrage people are funny , he’s done this for years but nobody cared until videos were made about it lol
Can this fucker and his fans sink any lower?
Abusers will never stop abusing.
Ofc hes a liar propagandist terrorist supporter 😡😡😡
Bro was indeed not slick
FREE KAYA!
"Fake it til you make it" is kind of a slippery slope when you never stop faking
I think that they would teaser It by leaving some hint hidden in the vídeo, Just tô never speak of It in the next 2 years
And yet, animal abuse on Twitch is totally ok
Ah yes the Educator. Kaya didn't shocked himself
He's literally just a Saddam/Stalin wannabe.
Get this guy cancelled. He's scum
his cult followers will still defend him somehow
who the fuck cares, we had a shock collar for our dog. They are sold broadly on amazon, you guys are making a spectacle out of literally nothing.
All the people defending him need to get off the Internet and touch grass. Maybe read a book or do your own research. He's brain broken to many people
wow, hassan is actually a narcissist.
It's a vibration collar which also has a remote he's already said he has a vibration collar you people are really sad and desperate this is also coming from a guy who says he doesn't really care about dogs but whatever...
Okay, lets wait for another MeatCanyon video
He is as cooked as how Kanzius cooked hot dogs from within.
This guy thinks we’re all dumb, even though the evidence is clear as day, what a piece of sh*t of a human being.
I wanna see him fall off now
ppl still doubting that this pos is a liar and nothing coming out of his mouth can be taken seriously or seen as truth?! How dense can ppl be actually, its astonishing. And somehow this pos narcissistic donut gets all the attention/fame/money etc. because somehow the average joe is attracted by these evil narcissistic donuts.
And the sad part is, that we can`t do anything to stop it. His dog is literally doomed. I mean, he secong one. Previous he already "shocked out".
You get a shock collar if your dog likes to bite the mailman, not for when your dog wants to live its life.
Snap necks cash checks
just have John Wick or Jack Reacher go over and take the dog away from him.
Dox that bastard and BEAT THE FUCKING BRAKES OF THAT MOTHERFUCKER.
And yet people still watching him. That's disgusting....
Wonderful, now let's see the Hasan defenders.
NARCISSIST WILL NEVER ADMIT ANY WRONG. capslock. I did NOTHING WRONG!!! here XD
You said the two women throwing paint on a terrible painting should get 20 years.  So what does this cruel prick get?!
Just report hasan already dweeb
“it’s actually endless lazy clickbait”
I cant wait for him to lose everything
He just keeps doubling down each time to somehow fk up even more
I'm more excited for the glorious cope his cult with try to come up with.
When did Israel put that there?
that look up was gold, it's like a child getting caught watching gay furry porn when mom comes in the room
The obese desperate women that are his followers will never turn on him
Big surprise the asshole abuses animals
He should have that dog taking off him
It's so over.
I just despise these type of characters. They would rather tell you that water is not wet if it would keep them out of negative public light. Image for these people is everything. It doesn't matter that behind the curtains, they are the most vile, corrupt and disgusting humans, if their public image is good, all is good and they sleep like babies at night.
mini "EDUCATOR"
Hasan is a psycho, this is not surprising.
Pffh.. nothing to said now Got busted
OK but also, its not even December yet, why is he putting up xmas stuff, or was this from last year and he's been shocking that poor dog for ages?
i'm playing the witcher 3 for the first time and i'm loving it , the music is so gorgeous i can hear it in this video also as an echo 😢
This is something straight out of Star Wars andor imperial prison, dog can’t touch ground with out being shocked, what a degenerate. Disgusting human being.
Nah bro that's just a dildo and you're crazy for thinking otherwise
Thank you almond for bringing this into the light. We will be taking action
"IT IS WHAT IT IS" (Hasans response to pretty much everything) 🙄 🔫
He has known this whole time that he’s a pos for using that shock collar and he’s been trying to hide it from his audience all along
Love it But nothing will come of this
A diddycrat girl same language as this terrorist tiktok trainers training them
Lying abusing piece of sh1t. I hope he gets everything thats coming to him
Idk what’s wrong with a shock collar
I don't get it, does hasan still stream after this? Has he not been banned or canceled yet?
at this point, just say thats a anal beads vibrator😂
Well even if this rat doesnt pay for his abusive behaviour in this life I sleep peacefully now knowing that he's certainly going to hell when he dies to suffer, if satans got a sense of humor he'll setup a shock collar for Hassan to punish him for the rest of eternity.
Why did Israel plant this on his table 🤔
smart people learn from their mistakes, wise people learn from other's mistakes. DONT lie... be accountable, internet does not forgive, if you are wrong be greatfull you might learn something from it, and if you are right then you would not have anything to hide. Im proud of the people that actually goes the extra mile to prove a point :D <3 that's why i pay for internet
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oh so NOW its ‘over’, huh? The last video where you said it was ‘over’ was a mistake then? How about the one before that?  Nah, THIS time, oh hell naw guys - THIS TIME he is truly OVER  shut up
Knowing Hasan's community, they're gonna be posting videos of shocking their own dogs to show it's normal to have a shock collar or make an emote of Kaya's shocked posture
pokimane supports this animal abuser and is sad about  her podcast with the animal abuser.
what fucking psychopath , never liked this hasan guy seemd sketchy by his face , this just proves it
I mean, i don't know anyone that would ever use one of those things fr
If you understand narcissists Hasan not admitting he's wrong, even about small things, makes total sense. Accountability is like kryptonite to NPDs
You know it's serious when he uses a pegasus title
Usual socialist pos
Why he putting up Xmas stuff already😂
I love the natural instinct of locking at the camera after doing something sus
This clip is new? Why the fuck is he decorating for Christmas? Maybe it’s an old clip.
I need a YT psychologist to breakdown Hassan's narcissism
Hasan is the literal personification of the “Who killed Hannibal” meme lol
Doesn’t matter. His supporters (including Twitch admin) are so brainwashed that no amount of proof will convince them otherwise.
Asmon audience is out for blood for no reason
Psycho POS control freak. See it for what it is
He’s obviously a horrible person. I think he could kill Kaya on stream and twitch and youtube wouldn’t ban him and his fans would still support him. To understand why this is you really have to remove any benefit of the doubt and recognize he and his community are just evil people being evil all day. Nothing intelligent, fair, or of value comes out of his mouth. Ignore him, ostracize him. Don’t support him or his orbiters or anyone who has him on their show in a friendly way
Asmon, why do you keep promoting this clown? You made him famous and keep adding to it
Tbf living with hassan has to be more abusive then the collar anyway
From her bed to the pc, Kaya will be free!
In the first video, I thought people were using "liberal tactics." Now, I apologize, I was wrong.
Feels good to be right, doesn’t it
Plz continue this barrage against Hasan, the guy is human trash and deserves imprisonment
fuq whoever that guy is
How long until he accuses the dog of being an Israeli Agent?
Hassan is a filthy subhuman towel that needs to be jailed for life.
You’ve got to be beyond retarded to make up the most obvious lie….then proceed to prove you’ve lied, all done by yourself 😂…Hasan you’re an actual moron 😂😂😂 That poor fucking dog
FREE FREE KAYA
Somebody take this K-9 abuser out already.
This has "dont fck with cats" vibes all over..
Reminder he lives in la ca report him to local pd.
It's just crazy that total useless moronic degenerate POS people just sit at home making money on camera like who the hell cares who they are or what they say especially this dude tazing dogs
so gross
Bro is a Radical Islamist Communist like he is the embodiment of everything wrong in Turkish culture but even our strays are happier than Kaya. My middel name is Kaya and it means big rock btw and that piece of shit shocks the dog whenever it moves.
The hypocrisy of this guy is always reaching new highs, unbelievable. I don't see any arguments or plausible justification anytime soon.. Just take the poor doggo away from him.
I have shock collars for both of my dogs, why is he lying about it.
I love this war these 2 have going on 😂
Never admitting you're wrong means that you ARE your ego.
Golly gee, i hope his stans dont make this a political issue and categorize everyone against him as conservative nazi
still unbanned
But guys Hasan said he was reaching for his zyns
This reminds me of this quote.  “First, a little lie; then, several little lies to prop it up. After that, distorted thinking to avoid the shame that those lies produce, then a few more lies to cover up the consequences of the distorted thinking. Then, most terribly, the transformation of those now necessary lies through practice into automatized, specialized, structural, neurologically instantiated “unconscious” belief and action. Then the sickening of experience itself as action predicated on falsehood fails to produce the results intended. If you don’t believe in brick walls, you will still be injured when you run headlong into one. Then you will curse reality itself for producing the wall.” ― Jordan B. Peterson, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos
There's nothing you can show to some people to change their mind, because they don't want their mind changed. For anyone with common sense the original clip was already enough.
At first it was weird , second clip? Suspicious the third? Come on man....
i dont think it is funny. this bastard needs to ne punished.
Nobody cares about people but dogs will start a riot
Hasan really need to delete himself
Hasan is pro Palestine but treats his dog like an israeli does an Palestininian.
i want that collar put round Hassans neck. Genuinely he will only learn his leason if he is tortured just enough to realise he is nothing and can be taken and tortured at any time when he has crossed the line
So we dont care about the Epstein files anymore but care about this Hasan guy with a shock collar..
Hassan: "If the dog bites, I shock her to new heights. If the dog is calm, I shock her still, 'cause there's no harm.  To me, myself and I."
i hope this make lord aethelstan stop hanging out with hasan. I hope this makes every streamer who hangs out with him to hate him
hes like, OH SHIT i got caught
It took a dog getting shocked to show the world that he’s a fascist.
I already knew he was a pathological liar. Now, I’m fully convinced he has antisocial personality disorder (specifically, a sociopath).
Чурка тупорылая, кто его смотрит?
Stupid nepo kid, with the worst character possible. God his parents have to be so proud...
that guy Hassan.. he deserves to be beaten and tased and beaten somemore till he is screaming for mercy then you tase his nuts. I for one would love to torture.. I mean, re-educate Hassan for a LONG period of time till he has learnt his lesson.
What a massive piece of poo he is
mad to me thats people are defending him the guy electric shocks his animals lol literal abuse
remember he said he didn't press something to sap the dog that day ^^ what a fking liar
Not admiting you are in fault or in other words, always thinking you are correct. Mhmm smells like narcissism to me. Who could have seen that one comming, that the dude that always tries to belittle every comment that does not fit his narrative, might be a narcissistic puppy electrocuter.
He saw the dog happy with that guest in his room for a second and immediately reached to shock her
All the dog trainers on tiktok eating their words
I hate Hasan, but that pan up to the camera and the realization was perfect "Oh..". That's hilarious.
The worst part is he is rich enough to just get rid of the collar and abuse his dog in other ways but chooses to keep the same evidence and keep using it knowing if he gets caught again, it just makes things worse.
why isnt he banned and cancelled on every platform yet??
Just imagine that his personal friends and employees all know he's lying but still support him over the dog? Spineless.
I got scared i thought that was Julien
Brother, are we back to the "its over" times 10 meme?  Also, i am shocked.. not quite as much as kaya, but still quite a bit.
Ever notice how liers have a particular look in the eyes?
What gets me … THE DOG DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING!   It’s disgusting to use a shock collar but to use it for no reason is another level of depraved. He’s Joffrey Baratheon
Asmon is a genius tbh. Farming pointless content live then getting another 2M views on YouTube. Amazing that people watch this stuff
this also proves that Hasan fans are SO blindly following him without a doubt in their mind, the dumbest people on earth and we should make test on them to see what makes them SO dumb
caught in 4k
Note how un-fit that dog is (and she's only, what, 2 or 3 years-old?) - no muscle tone, overweight, seems to find just changing position laborious.
LMFAO!
Twitch officially supports animal cruelty. Not to be surprised since they let this guy continuously stream his support for terrorists and hate speech as well.
My dads dog was the best dog I seen wouldn’t eat unless told (people poisoned a few dogs around town) she loved other animals birds cats other dogs if they were friendly only scared of reptiles she was trained to so she stayed away from snakes she got haunt her back was at my hip I could almost ride her like a horse haha but turned out she had brain cancer that blocked the hormones to tell her to stop growing I got photos of her with my dad she was like a daughter to him her sit in the car was the front seat with dad driving haha she was his princess she would protect him against anything poor thing got brain cancer that’s why she got so big she wasn’t stopping growing so dad ended getting her put down so she wouldn’t suffer or be in pain I still look at photos of her and smile she wasn’t stopping she was a massive monster of a dog but the heart of a gentle giant she loved my dad and would sit in front of him and he would talk and she would make noises back like she thought he could understand her and have a conversation with her  I remember moving here and saying dad she doesn’t know what your saying and he was like wanna bet and I was like wtf she could be told so many things and she would do them tell her go outside check the yard and she would then come back inside he would say you haven’t had any water lately go have a drink and she would go outside drink water and come back best dog I’ve even had/seen
Ok.
This makes total sense when you realize Hasan used to be a Pickup Artist Bro streamer. Think about how many Pickup artists tell you just get a dog and walk them to get women's attention, so they'll start petting them and being all friendly to you. Essentially using dogs as a prop. It's exactly what he does now, his dog is a prop and gets shocked if it leaves view of his camera, and he has emotes and merch of his dog. He's made it part of his image, it's a prop.
Lock him up
I hope he catches a serious beating.
Is that kind of thing illegal on the USA?
THAT POOR DOGGO
Cinema.... Absolute Cinema........
Hasan is such a shit stain. Who in their right mind would follow that prick anyways? Or even give him money just for being a prick?
Pirate Dogware
Turkish Muslim that explains all
its so over
1:19 he never admits that he's wrong even about like anything small. this isn't small. he has shock collar for his dog.
Typical arab
Trump, take his citizenship away! He's a terrorist that's literally grooming kids to become terrorist in OUR OWN COUNTRY. Do something for our country for once, instead of catering to other countries 24/7.
Imagine not being able to teach your dog good behavior without violence. How fucked up can you be when that is the way you choose.
Quick.... Someone Put the Shock Collar on Hassan and hit the switch!!
Dogs...
SOMEONE PLEASE TAKE THAT POOR PUPPY AWAY FROM THAT POS!  IT’S ANIMAL ABUSE & HE SHOULD NOT HAVE AN ANIMAL OF ANY KIND!
Seems like Kaya isn't the only one who was shocked
i actually got scared thinking you were leaving youtube bcs of the title "Its actually over"  and the backgorund  🥲
Cancel Amongold, remember, he said to feed undocumented immigrants to the alligators.
How can the far right and Israel keep doing this to him? Clearly the Nazi Fascist Zionists went back in time to plant the remote there after harnessing the powers of red crayon fueled magatards on jet powered merry-go-rounds.
He’s not going anywhere. His devout followers truly don’t care. Pokimane case is the perfect example.
Why is an un American, terrorist sympathizer putting up a Xmas tree in october?
Just send these clips to PETA and police, pretty sure streaming live pet abuse is a crime.
Presumably those lackeys milling around are aware of that shock collar?
Yall too focused on other peoples lives. Broke activities
Oh god Hassan is proven lying again!! What a shocker 😅
Hasan the god of thunder
Ask my friends he said 😂😂 Yeah, i am convinced that those two people behind Hasan would lie just to be his "friends".
Hahaha Hasan is DONE😂😂😂
you can call to violence again and again but dont you dare hitting a dog
Ok, i know it's important but... Shoc Collar aside, It's half of october, why the hell is he putting Christmas Tree?
how is he this dumb
Sick person
How is he going to talk his way out of this one? He is such a retard he will probably talk too much again.
"Stop the abuse of power! Hold the people in power accountable for the torture!" "Wait what me? no I didn't do anything and even if you have video and photographic evidence, that still doesn't mean anything! Now watch the dog yelp!"
never in my 30 years have i used a shock collar on any of my dogs. They were always raised right and never attacked no one. It´s about YOU losing YOUR TIME to EDUCATE the doggys. making a doggy sit on stream and shock him into place for various hours is just sad
this muslim scumbag is a piece of shit. they all trweat dogs the same way.
This guy is human piece of garbage.
"no justice, no treats" Kaya lives matter
„Why would Israel Shock my dog“ - Hasan probably
Are we surprised that the man who condones terrorism is also an animal abuser? No.
Disgusting POS. Poor dog.
again! no one is surprised that a psychopath that calls for the deaths of people with opposing ideas hurts animals.
Bro, trust me, its the remote for his plugged in vibrator
This is how he treats a pet that loves unconditionally.
We went from "Its not happening" to "Its not happening, but if it did why do you care" to "It happened but there are reasons why its a good thing" in record time
If America ever installs communism, this will be exactly the type of mf who will be in charge
I write this under every Hasan video: The wrong animal is wearing the shockcollar
Dude is a monster! It's always like this, the guys who claim they want world peace and everyone is a fascist are the worst monsters of all.
Charlie Kirk gets killed and Hasan gets to keep living?
It doesn’t matter, Twitch loves this Turk.
But of course, the cult will say that Hasan is innocent
If it wasn't a shock collar my guy wouldn't be so flinchy and insecure looking at the camera like "oh shit they saw it". If it was a vibration collar only he wouldn't even care moving it away. Bro knows what he is doing
you do 1000 videos about stuff like vibrator thing or whatever it is. but you do zero videos about how your tax money goes to making bombs to kill 100 000 children.. wow such priorites .. uslesss human
Well… it may not have been advocating for legitimate terrorists or calling for real political violence that brought him down… but at least something did…
next time they say ohh well you can put lots of effort into changing the skin of the "pager" to look like the shock version but still claim it is impossible to remove the screws the the contacts are mounted on from the shock version. He just happened to take the "skin" of the ET-800 "The Boss" instead of putting a cool alternative custom skin on there. Also don't mind that the "vibration collar" he showed has the charging port at the same position as any other shock collar and not where the PG-300 has it. TBH by now he can only save his ass from the alligations by providing an PG-300 reciept that is older than the christmas video. And even then there is something odd since every collar has the potential for vibration, so even if he claims he only uses it on vibrate he made the claim that it is vibration only. He could've said "it is an old model my room mate bought but I removed the prongs and put tape over it to completly prevent it from shocking Kaya. What makes it so suspicious are his claims together with the clear differences in charging position and removed screws. And even to "defang" the shock option one should rather add non shocking extensions on the screws to distribute the vibration and prevent any accidential shocks  The best defense would've been "I had this collar but only used vibration mode, I may have accidently hit the shock mode. I will now buy a vibration only one to prevent that acccident from ever happening again. I legit thought she was a baby for reacting like that to vibration but I see that I should've got a vibrating one from the start and nto use the one I got gifted".  Also don't mind that regardless of what collar he doesn't take the time to check if Kaya "just" wants to roam the room, lie on the ground or actually want to take something to drink from the bowl (that is actually positioned at a spot that she looked towards all the time).
🎉
No worries people it’s for his vibrating  dildo! he got it as a gift from Diddy
now we gotta figure out on which voltagele-level he shocked the dog
We knew he was a hateful liar but we are shocked he treats his dog like a prop and blames his mom that he has to abuse her to keep her in frame?
WIDE SHOT "BOOM" ahahahahahahahah
They would put everyone else in Mini Educators if they could
Communists will never admit that they are wrong. That's why you end up with hundreds of millions of deceased citizens.
Wow he is a despicable disgusting POS!
Another day, another shock.
What's with the Xmas tree ? He is unhinged & needs locking up Nasty bastard.
Watch how his fans still defend him 😂🙏🏻
can we stop saying its  over and jut end it
I do not get this.  What is the issue with someone having a dog shock collar?  There must be some history to this one I am not aware of? I have to admit I do not even know who it is.
A lying piece of shit
Can I buy his dog
DEPORT THE *S* *A* *N* *D* *N* *I* *G* *G* *E* *R* AND SAVE THE DOG
Hasan is going to stamp his feet and a thousand jannies with brooms will appear.
Hitler loved dogs
Bro cancel this guy already I'm sick of seeing him
Hahahahaha
A real man doesn't have to shock his dog.
I kind of want to find him in real life and put a shock collar on his as and lock his bitch ass in a corner of the dog is misbehaving but I bet he’s a control freak and does this shit 24/7 to his big dog that needs room to roam pos hope he gets his ass kicked
It's so obvious he's lying! Anyone with NOTHING to hide would immediately show everything in good detail on camera.
I hope they take his dog from him.
Now he's a dog shocker and proven liar. Damage control gonna be on high alert
Why do his family put up with him? He lives with his mom, right? Why does she put up with him? Why is he streaming his garbage while they're decorating? Why hasn't his dog snapped? Why hasn't his mom let the dog escape? Why has nothing been done about this horrible man?
Levi Nichs would never…
Narcississtic behaviour 101. They never, ever, admit any wrong doing, even after insurmountable evidence. Their ego won't let them. And then they gaslight/twist/lie it into being your fault, by any means available.
Im sitting on 5 acres of land here in Florida. Ill adopt that dog and she can run free all day every day.
The SAME reason a T-Girl won't admit they're NOT REALLY a Girl..    THEY KNOW ITS WRONG.
Imagine being so braindead he continues to stream and incriminate himself because he legitimately wants to keep shocking his dog. What an absolute scumbag.
What a fkin looser
I wish that dude would just go off himself already...  Do it Live for his lil Demon followers.
Punish this guys, why are wokies having such a hard time imposing the same rules and demands they made to their own kin
guys, can we normalize shocking Hasan?
Somebody call John Wick😭💔
☪️ancer ✅️ ☪️anceled ✅️✅️
Title "it's over" + asmon channel = i click I don't care who is that Hasan guy
thanks to the hero who found it and saved the poor dog
In all seriousness, does this cross the threshold of actual illegal animal abuse? I've seen people arrested for doing less.
cant wait to see how his fans will spin this one will it be "that isnt a remote you are insane" or will we go to and see a double down on the last stage of the "no its not that / it is that but it aint that bad / actually, its a really good thing" pattern
Shocking allegations
Bro the whataboutism going in the comment section is just crazy.
Hasan's gooner defense : He is using *ah*strokingsounds* it to educate *ah*morestroking*ah* the dog on how to behave *ahImaboutocomeonhasanpic*.
I hate dog abuse
Hassan's dog will be shocked when Hassan sees this video
Professional  narcissist and liar.
Was always obvious as everytime he would reach he would look at his screen to check behind him at the dog
Animal abuse is fkng disgusting man, how can you laugh about this?
🐕‍🦺⚡💯
When will Idubbbz get one for his wife?
for a long time i didn't realize how stupid hasan was because i don't watch his weird propaganda content. i knew he was an evil liar and assumed he was probably intelligent enough to be effective, but then i watched asmon's coverage of the debate he had with ethan and quickly learned he's actually a complete idiot. and yet somehow he still manages to surprise me with new lows
Taqiyya is a hell of a thing huh? Being allowed to lie like that an having an entire thing in your religeon for it..weird huh?
Guys, give Hasan some chance. That's the same collar that he use when he sucks Twitch CEO dick.
This is exactly why you don’t lie. Keeping a lie hidden won’t last forever. You will always get found out or caught.
yup if thats not 100% then 200%
People are too focused on what he used and not what it was for. He could have yelled or something and the idea would still stand. This guy is making his dog sit still for hours behind him on a little bed with no stimulus and the moment the dog moves an inch he makes it stop and go back to the same spot that is crazy i would never do that to my dog
I think what happened to the dog is that one of the prongs didnt attach to the skin correctly because the dog has a very thick fur, and so if the other prong attached to the skin correctly, Hassan pushed the remote the moment the dogs paw was on the metal frame of the bed, so the electricity took the path with the least resistance and it went straight trough the dogs leg to the frame, hence the dog yelled in pain because it was a different sensation compared to what it usually feels. Neverthless Hassan is a dirtbag.
doggy don`t worries about e-collar, but gun that he has
The funny part of this is that there's no reason to have a huge overhead wide shot for his stream lol he's literally sitting his ass in a chair eating donuts. Having a moronic ego is the only way that he got caught. On top of that, after everything, he still has the shot collar. You'd think coming that close to getting caught you would get a different collar and throw that stuff in the trash lmfao but not this guy!!!
I feel like shocking your dog is not something small. That’s pretty evil
He wont admit hes ever wrong because hes a massive narcissist. He thinks hes smarter than everyone one else, so admitting hes wrong undermines that world view. Instead he tries tonlie his waynout because "hes smarter than everyone else" and we wint figure it out.
Hopefully there's a group of people getting kitted out to go rescue that dog and give Hasan a few shocks while they're there
Whoever found this clip is a saint! 😂
Can there be some dog rescue effort done? People know where he live for that? Nah I won't call for violence but maybe animal welfare gets interested.
We all already knew Hassan wont be getting anything for any of this. At first they all said "she stub her toe", then "its a vibrating collar" and now its "shock collars are normal thing to use".
What a degenerate that guy is. Blatant proof for the world to see, yet he still spits lies off that serpent tongue of his. Absolute degenerate.
Yeah, as others have said in the comments, the dog going nowhere near the guy is Extremely telling. If your dog loves you it will do anything to be by your side even if there's other people around giving it affection and attention it will always come back to the person it loves the most and who treats it best. It's going as far as it can to get away from him. That says it all. He's a despicable person and the dogs know. The dogs ALWAYS know a shitty person. They can smell it on them. I guarantee you this guy REEKS to that poor dog. Just his scent would set off her fear factor.
Honestly idgaf what he says about trump or anything else cause its not that deep, but shocking your dog to keep them in stream is disgusting…
Caught himself in 1080p
people are really comparing literal genocide to dog with a shock collar 😂
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him
One furry redditor comparing you to Trump, imagine. No, I mean literally. Considering it's Hasan, imagine one of your ghouls tells you are exactly like the one you spew hate about. HILARIOUS.
I can't belive the Zionists planted that shock remote on his desktop.
What a bad person.
You next.
CAUGHT
Hes actually being a consistent marxist. In section 3 of the communist manifesto, Marx critiques the french and German communists for being against violence and murder to secure the revolution. Kaya was simply hindering the revolution by not being eye candy.   This is insanely stupid and evil, but still justified under marxist philosophy/ethics (because marx was stupid and evil)
I once got a shock collar for my dog, and said you know what... Let me try this thing first, and after I got up off of the floor I threw it in the garbage. Anyone that wants to get one of those for a dog should be required to try it out first.
Reminds me of PirateSoftware.
If twitch won't get him, PETA will.
This whole debacle was amazing marketing for the educator et-300 mini
Love it, dude is a creep. He can go away now.
Still, Twitch moderation team will continue to s*ck his c*ck sooo much, they're at 'pron' levels of copium lmao. Those biased losers should have been fired long ago.
a e collar used correctly is a great training tool but this guy has zero clue what he is doing and appears to be abuse with a much stronger signal that's needed especially when the dog wasnt doing anything wrong and no commands were given instead just a strong shock. I do a lot of dog training and this is just sad. BTW this e collar is one of the best out out their because how low you can turn it but he just has is dialed up
I can't be bothered to research this. Is this person forcing a dog to sit in one spot to increase streaming views? Is he in a country where animal abuse violations are enforced? Are they being enforced in this case? It seems like an easy case due to the evidence being publicly available.
Why do people follow that guy? Legit question
GUYS IS IT OK TO FK THE DOG?! IT'S SHOWING LOVE! MY TAIL IS WAGGING!
What diference does it make? nothing is gonna happen
This individual is a bonafide psycho and doesn't deserve a dog or any other pet.
muzlemz and animal abuse go hand in hand
Is he cooked tho??
Hasan is so ugly- inside and out.
I’m shocked! SHOCKED! …well not that shocked.      Kaya: I’m shocked! SHOCKED!
😂😂😂😂😂 this is so damn funny idk why.
Heck owes what he’s doing by hiding it . If it was. Vibrating one he would just leave it unless he has something to hide . He shows that dog multiple times a day . That’s ABUSE
yeah bro is done
My heart goes out to that dog, if you dislike a dog barking, don't get a dog at all...
Will anything even happen, its so much news but nothing of substance is happening, he isnt getting banned no group is trying to take kaya away NOTHING IS HAPPENING
Now we need to use it on Hasan and give Asmon a remote control.
He should be arrested and charged for animal cruelty
"I repeat, we did not trade arms for hostages"
Asmon treats roaches better than Hasan treats dogs.  Yet they say Asman is the heartless one.  That's what it's like being manipulated by a narcissist.
It's honestly hysterical that we are still here debating about the ''allegations'', the dog should be considered mistreated regardless of the damn collar. The whole point has always been that pets are to be educated to not shit or pee all over your house, not destroy your couch and not being loud every other minute to respect your neighbours; exactly like you do with kids, period. Those are living beings not there to entertain you in the first place, hence 99.9% of any other restriction is not for sharing a place, but rather abuse of power.  If your pet can't roam the palce you share, just don't get one, simple as that. ''She has to stay on that because otherwise it's bad for her joints'', that's bullshit and also, if it is really your priority, buy carpets or moquette, I am pretty sure you can afford it.
Here in norway shock collars are illegal, but you can get those with sound, hunting collars tell you when the dog stops for a few seconds, and you can press a button to make a sound, that tells the dog to come back to you, good for training.
Two questions Hasan will never answer.  1) If it's not supposed to be what his haters think it is, then why did he move it out of frame?  2) Why did he look shocked when it was moved out of frame?
someone should put a shock collar on hasan
He once said he never got the degree, cuz he doesn't need it. (Paraphrasing) Nah, bro. He's simply retarded.
whats crazy to me about this is that its not even illegal in his state sure in my opinion its inethical but y does he care so much about it hes by legal stand point not in trouble
He looked more shocked than Kays at the end there
So we have proved not only that Hasan abuses his dog but is also a liar….
So are users of shock collars cancelled now or was he abusing it? I don’t know the whole story lol
who cares? this is weird. creepy
He knows what he's doing is bad and yet he still does it.  Another telltale sign of the narcissistic liberal.  Zero self control, zero emotional control, zero self discipline.
I couldn't care less for Hassan but are we mad at the shock collar? or are we mad at how hes using cause millions of people use shock collars last i checked.  like if you think there's animal abuse just report it and they'll do their own investigation.
Caught in 8k 😂
Hasan looks at the camera like, yall didn’t notice me clearly move that right?
man is the lowest form of life on the planet right now lol
Cause destruction & chaos for the chance of doing reverse gängbång with 72 virgins in jannah who have regenerating hymens. - Qúrån (Terrorist Cult Manual written by Arabian warlord dictator Móhämmëd)
Muslims & negros causing chaos & destruction wherever they go....
THATS A MOTHERFUCKING BUST 😂😂😂
The worst part about all these is thousands of hasan fans still support him and defend him
"The Mossad put it there you guys!"
The only one shocked by this was the dog.
never let him live this down lmao don't let him get away with lying about this
The sooner this supporter of terrorism is gone the better Hassan  should have been arrested a very very long time ago if I had my way he'd never see the light of Day
Crazy how some other terrorist love to keep captives and torcher them for support.... wonder where he gets this notion from. I think he is just cosplaying a Hamas Terrorist from is bedroom using the dog as a hostage. This is really the only way he really get to be the terrorist he wants to be without any real risk. He is a coward and nothing but  grifter to begin with.
What a pathetic individual.
I'm more surprised that this stupid, spinless nepo has enough followers to become rich than I am by his actions.
hasan fans are literally brainwashed. They cant think for them self. What the new response going to be now from them? Ok... sure he did it, sure he lied about it, sure he gas lit everyone about it, sure he uses his dog as a prob, sure he got mad and shocked the dog out of anger, but he is a good guy that doesn't lie besides this one time.
Pretty much every single islamist ever  Kinda like mamdani
He's so dumb it makes me belive he does it on purpose
I mean the guy has said he is against Hitler and everything he stands for.( If you cannot verbally train your dog, do not become a Streamer!!!. You failed with the Animals what makes you think you can succeed with Humans? Or you wanna put Collars on us also?
At least this proves to a lot of people he is a pathological liar. So it's not all bad.
Every other day: "It's over." It's DEFINITELY over". "He's DONE". "NOW it's over". "Not now but NOW!".
Poor dog 😔
His mother is spoiling the remote too much, he just gave it a place command! Why are you guess so mean to him?
Can’t wait for terrorizer and nogla to react to this now 😂
God he's such a dumb fucking retard.
This terrorist should be in gitmo.
the looking into the camera with oh you got me face xD
i have never seen someone more cooked than hasan rn
1:10 seriously. Why would someone with so much video of him, lie about something he did on video?  There's so many people watching these clips they will find the truth. What an idiot.  You shocked that dog.  Either be honest or stop doing it.
"Hiding it in plain sight just like trump" bro used evey bit of energy in his body to not say them 2 last words 😂😂😂😂
Whenever Hasan gets arrested and being out on bail and forced to wear an ankle monitor, I hope it has a shock option too.
2 EZ
Im about as shocked as kaya
It's not over. Zero punishment
free kaya
do. not. let. this. go.
Everyone should bomb his stream with "ET-300"... or start calling him the "mini-educator".
How does this guy have a following? Oh, people are people. Right.
NOOOOO YOU ARE ALL IDIOTS HE IS INNOCENT REEEEEE
The leftrash is not human, what a surprise
They must take away the Dog :/
I have a dream, because if I don't, Hassan will electrocute me -MLK
Why would Israel do this
BUSTED BITCH 😂 GOTTEEM!
Imagine putting up Christmas decorations as a muslim atheist communist as a distraction. 🤡🤡🤡
If PETA doesn’t act now, they’re complicit  Edit: Just adding some context, PETA saw the video of Kaya getting shocked but because they weren’t sure at a 100% it was a shock collar, they said that they couldn’t act. Now, with this info, If it is a transgression/animal abuse, they should be doing their job.
You don't understand guys, it's the remote for the vibrator up his ass
lets thanks hasan for giving us more and more evidence
Somebody call PETA on this mofo mu$L1m trash!
Yeap, 100% an electric shock remote for that specific model.
All very wild, but lets see in a week or 2 if there are any repercussions. Or its all just memes
The tower hadan has built has reached the clouds. Too bad its built on nothing but lies. Destined to come crashing down in the most spectacular of fashions.
Putting out christmas decor in October to try to distract people from his animal abuse. Ffs. Hassan is just an unhinged angry liberal narcissist
Guarantee he won’t get banned for this.
What baffles me is that now that he's got caught with this clip and he might get banned from Twitch for doing Animal Abuse, *he's gonna get bamned because of that.*  Not from all the sh**ty things he said about Pro-Hamas and the down of Israel.
Shock collars aren't intrinsically bad, but it has to be used judiciously and only to support proper training. We adopted a neurotic German shepherd and only used the collar when he was doing something dangerous to himself or the other dog. Two weeks later he was much happier knowing the rules and boundaries. It's been three years and he's the happiest, most chill dude.
Well, aint that just the thing about compounding lies upon lies upon lies - you have to keep track of them all and inevitably there are too many to consistently manage and you slip up on one.  Best practice is to not be doing something you'd need to lie about in the first place, like say.... animal abuse.
Lock Him Up!!
True Muslim. Hates dogs just like his book says.
typical muslim
Pure bitch. Dude is pure bitch.
Hey all you stupid hasan followers explain this one!
Hasan can give a Ted Talk for Pavlovian Conditioning.
GUILTY!
Hasan goat lover
Anyone who follows that piece of shit is as guilty of animal cruelty as Hasan.
Now animal police should definitely intervene and safe the doggy!
I don't know what's worse, the collar or the fact that he uses it force his poor dog to stay put in that one specific square. Why? Let that poor dog roam what's it gonna do?
So he abuses his dog. What a nice guy. Or even weirder. Maybe he uses it on himself.
You can tell alot about someone by they way they treat their waiter and pets.
The dog warden needs to step in and remove the animal from the property.
He's a far leftist. He won't face any consequences
Is this also in a size for a human neck? like say for a women? asking for my friends close friend hé doesnt has internet.
You know who refused to electrocute their dogs....the nazis. Exactly
Don't panic ppl its just vibra collar 😂
I wanna pit that huge ahole in a tiny crate for 8 hours......WOTH A SHOCK COLLAR.
tbf i use shock and wibration collar and my dog and i dont think its wrong morally etc, if u do u either have very small dog or most likely no dog. OR u have big house with outside area.
what can you say about my dog when there isn't a genocide happening (anything thats done my islamic groups aren't genocides)
''-ladies and gentlemen, we got him''
karma always comes
A true terr0rist 😂
This is how out of content Asmond is lately. Nobody cares about this crappy terrorist streamer Hasan or the pro-terrorism platform that is Twitch.
Wait so people are actually upset about a shock collar on a animal  Fuck that kids need these  Every emotional outburst you have SHOCKED!!!
Hassan isn't very smart but he's a left so makes sense
Boy oh boy it’s so easy to hate Hasan terrorist supporter animal abuser and yet he still platformed crazy
Can i get some likes too?
Hahahahahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂
wow, who the f uses shock collars for dogs. Shouldn't even be legal. These people shouldn't be allowed to have dogs. They're sitting in their chairs 13 hours a day and the dog probably barely gets out and then gets shocked and mistreated if he gets anxious or nervous.
how is this MF-er not banned yet ? yeeez these people at twitch are f-ing corrupt
Those who support hasan doesn't know they are in a cult.
His dog lives in misery 😭
I dont understand this. Its not ilegal …
The fact that hes even looking at the dog when hes shocking it... its like hes enjoying it
i dont really have a list of streamer that i hated with passion but that list is growing fast now.
Man just had to be the dumbest guy ever
Unreal that Twitch allows this guy to shock his dog to keep it in one little spot on his cam while it wants to drink water.  Any rando would have been permabanned by now.
Hassan is psycho man,how can you torture dog like that
We should put that electric collar on Hasan so he can finally shut up and behave for once
Hassan fan will said that is just a tic tac box
Inmates get better treatment then this dog
"Educator" The dogs got its doctorates in electrical engineering by now I'm sure. 😵‍💫
attractive people usually cant admit they are wrong they cant even admit to lose because they have it all
Things they absolutely dont like in prison.  1. C-A'ers  2. S-A'ers 3. A-A'ers  Seems like Hasan is in for a h311 of a ride (literally and figuratively).
Sick shell of a human being
The way he looks up at the camera and realizes he's done
I still find it totally ridiculous that out of everything shitty hasan had done, the thing people finally decide is too far is animal abuse. People let him get away with openly supporting terrorism, calling for viewers to murder their landlords, calling for the wife of ethan klein to be murdered, bullying and manipulating everyone around him, calling for political assassinations to happen more often, and many other things, but yea he shocks the dog and everyone suddenly gets offended. This is not me saying he isn't wrong for doing that, but if that dog is more important than human life that he openly supports ending, people got some seriously messed up priorities
Surprise a Turk mistreated a dog 😂😂😂
Hasan “High Voltage” Piker
Fuckin coward POS
Great now autists will be spamming the same unfunny shock joke in the comments for years now.
you'd be in jail for using one of those in my country.
Wow so much proof that he’s an animal abuser, can’t wait for him to not get punished in any way
And still not banned or investigated.
I guess this explains why he hasn't disclosed the name of the brand for the vibration-only collar he's supposedly using LOL
Can we do something about the poor dog? Is there any legal action we can take to find this dog a loving family? 😥
W
please digital lords, we need this evil little man off the internet...
I will never forget when Hasan said about himself as beeing nothing else but good propagandists. Observing his retorics and manipulations when exposed, just confirm that he REALLY think that of himself. He uses pure Goebbels methods. And I know what im talking about as european.
I didn't need this extra video to know he did it, but this basically should be enough to silence any of his defenders.  Welp. GG for your career pal
hasan fans are just like trump supporters
God I hope it's the end of that prick
X had everything down right yet again
Electrifying collar of socialism +1
It's on the same side too...what is wrong with this guy? 🤦🏿‍♂️
Can we NOT give such inhumane beings any more attention please. As a dog lover myself, and as someone that needs a dog to help cope with PTSD I really can't say how or what I feel about such people(censorship and all...). Lets just say I would not want to be near him. Three things that would get me really back into a combat-mode is hurting women, children, and animals(especially dogs).   But Karma will happen.
He should wear the collar, and the remote should be jammed into Kaya's chew-toy.
When Hasan focuses on character assassinations instead of their views, his self-image must remain pristine.
Dude loves shocking that dog for no reason! Gets off on it.
rolled & smoked
Twitch staff is on vacation? They don’t ban him?
And he still won't admit it
“Why are we worried about this when glaciers are melting” - valkyrae probably
The serious and dark issue is what is happening with the dog behind the scenes now.  I'm so sorry, Kaya.
what is actually funny is the total lack of critical thinking. took me 3 sec to find the website of the seller. So its a tone/vibration collar. Cant stand hasan but come on guyz use your brain, check things by yourself and stop being brainwashed sheeps.
Free Kayastine!!! Let's end this dogocide!!!
It also may be the T-800 (it's black). It has the "best" shocking power.
...RIGHT liar and a narcissist
and now his fans will go from "he dindu nuthin" to "she deserved it actually"
It's a very musical collar
And twitch is the worst
Doesnt matter. His sociopathic followers will ignore even this proof. He will never have to answer for any of it and twitch still does nothing as Dan Clancy will continue to goon to his insane takes and calls to violence. If he didnt get banned by literal terrorist glazing and calls for murder for a senator, what makes you think abusing his dog on stream will do?
"it wasn't a shock collar" "okay, it was a shock collar, but it was on vibrate." "okay, it wasn't on vibrate, but it was on a low setting." "okay, it wasn't on a low setting, but..."
That's just cruel. This guy are sadist, someone should take the dog away from him.
😅😢
Hassan to hushh-uh
i hope someone is putting a shockcollor on him, and puts in On and leave it on untill he dies
His fuck ups are just pure comedy at this point, the way he looks at the camera and just goes.. "oh.." 💀💀💀
shocking a dog just to get it to go to bed is next level twisted. Those are made to force a dog to LEARN things like not running into the fuckin street bc it doesn't get it. Yes it might not be pleasant but it would save their life. Shocking a dog bc it didn't IMMEDIATELY obey you, introduces many many other issues with his personality and traits.
Hasan Piker should be publicly flogged and then deported with nothing but the clothes on his stinking back.
Fucking disgrace, someone should get that dog out of there asap.. animal torture is so creepy and nasty.
Poor kaya
In germany we call that "Hurensohn"
Every single day, a shiny new clip pops up to hilariously dismantle yet another layer of his towering pile of lies.
Absolute psycho and sociopath.
I don't think Hasan cares about it, I think he is just acting to get more views and become popular. He is like Johnny Somali but indoors. Today, you can only be popular if you did something wrong.
Shocks his dog on camera and then lies about it.
Am i confused or something arent shock collars legal why are people acting like he commit a crime
Don't know who he is, he's a loser though
Some people are never wrong.
Now that you've beaten the final boss. Is there a new game plus option 🤔
you should know thats how they lie and lie untill it reaches audience that lie is true. its moslim thing they lie lie because they dont have any facts just like pakistan making headlines that we destroyed 10 planes and celebrating like they won the war. just islam teachings
RIP
Yikes
Notice how his fans run to his defence. It's almost as if they don't have any principles. I would instantly unsubscribe from anyone if I saw them doing something like this.
Why are they putting up Christmas decorations in October?
John Wick do your job
How is Hassan so popular, he's such an idiot.
i thought this was alireza
free the dog. if anyone deserves love it’s that dog. poor thing
Hasan orbitors and fans are panicking and coping
He really needs to come out and give an apology. Otherwise he will never hear the end of it
Can we finally lock this guy up already?
People he invited for streams were sitting right in front of it, saw the remote, knew what was happening, therefore approved of it, ergo supporting animal abuse, then lied about it. The company Hamas Puker keeps are all like him. Abusive terrorist apologysts and violence supporters. Disgusting.
I've never wanted to punch someone in the face more in my entire life. Shame on twitch for letting him keep his platform and where TF is animal services because that dog needs to be taken from him
It's almost unbelievable. Like this is something you would see written into a sitcom.
Is anyone shocked besides Hasan's dog?
Tis your general turkish guy. Got to know them since there is milions of them here in germany. They actually dont like dogs that much.
The H in Hasan is for Hurensohn.
Imagine being seen by your cult of fans as attractive, big and manly yet not knowing how to bond or train your dog properly without using a shock collar on a calm dog at that. A female dog that's not even territorial or out of place. Just wants to cuddle and be loved. This is a big breed, used to keeping an eye out on the livestock, not being tied to a bed for 4 hours or having a streamer owner who uses her as a trophy on his stream and can't take her out as much as she requires. Not only is this a guy that talks about politics, some kind of sovereignty and justice, yet doesn't live what he preaches, as all politicians too. He's also a so called Muslim, assumingly reads Quran, yet doesn't live by what it says in it either. He's a fraud through and through. His friends even worse for living this lie with him. Some who defended him just turned out to be dumber than they previously were, and those who didn't say anything just as much. But it is clear that the remote he uses to shock his dog was in plain sight the whole time.
Hideous Hasan ,the barbaric dog torturer .
What a shocking revelation, I’ll take my Oscar now
if you get views continue it.... otherwise this guy hasan is a falling star. his time is over. he will be found wanting.
Who are those other people?
Moving it out of frame, lying about it repeatedly - it all shows he KNOWS it is wrong. I look forward to the stories his fan-base will make to defend this xD
He'll say its AI, calling it now!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
His clothes are so oversized he looks like a fucking roblox character
Dumbass tried to hide it
K9/11 will go down as the biggest tragedy of the year. Never forget
If he had to press the control with the foot all of this would have been easier for him, still silly, still bad for the dog, cant take someone like that seriously
This is Hasan's =Page5
So he lied,I am so surprised Guys.....
How the F has police or peta not involved? Must be daddys momey again
"Oh I was just reaching for a donut" *(looks at camera unsuspicioulsy)*
"No, I didn't shock her ! Oh oh, Mark."
This is why autistic people need to stay well away from owning Animals.
Okay great, now what? Will anything happen to him or the dog be saved? Probably not, so all this is just useless ... and sad.
The way Hamas Piker looks at the camera says it all.
How is that fool still on Twitch!? He should’ve been permabanned long ago. Not only does he brainwash his impressionable viewers with lib nonsense but he abuses his dog!!
hasan diddy epstein piker strikes again being an absolute animal abuser
Hassan Hussein😂
Dog abuse isn't funny
Hey, now he's got ACTUAL dog props! Two of them even!
Are we in the "It happened and it's actually a good thing"-phase of this yet?
They need to stop using the terminology of "Educator" when it comes to shock collars or anything harming, it's cruel and abuse.
I hope he gets what he deserves....just wow...
Whoever found this needs a therapist and paid vacation, seriously. What a hero.
But it's funny how people really care about the lives of animals more than the lives of people😂😂😂. And they try to turn against the one person who really cares about the lives of the people suffering in Gaza... Okay let's say he really using shock collar on his dog. Okay, that's bad and it really needs to be talked about... But why do all these people who show up and talk about the dog and try to play the detective, never talk about the children who are being torn apart every day? Like is this faire ....carring about à dog over thousands of kids . Sad😢
what a pos
I wonder if hasan and piratesoftware are friends
this is great when shit happens to clowns
Zeus would disapprove
Yeah, the tolerant left would use that on all of us who disagree with them.
The most shocking thing is why are we still talking about it. Do something about it streamers if he is really doing the animal cruelty stuff take his pet away and be done with it.
Hasan is becoming the definition of self-owned.
If he do stuff like that - he is pathological liar. You really should not trust that man and his political judgments.
you have to think about it, this guy is not smart enough to comprehend easy things, the device could have been hidden beforehand and he dosen't understand that moving it out of frame, is actually diverting the attention from other things. Humans will instantly perceive motion and focus on it, he could have screamed: look what i have here
man what an abusing lying piece of shit, even if people got over the collar, bro the fact he was just lying to his entire audience thinking they're stupid enough to lie to, sad abusing liar
Hasan pretends to be all righteous and savior and supporter of palestine, but in reality he is just an animal abuser
What a shocking turn of events...
Smh if ur gna shock ur dog don’t get one! Put a shock collar on him and zap the shit outta him please
Its meant for dog training if used properly.  Its as 0-100  power rating.  Usually u only need it on 5-10 rating to get your ADHD dogs attention.  If he is using it on a high setting incorrectly yes burn him.   I dont like the guy but there is a lot of misunderstanding of what that tool is used for.
Hassan fans will STILL defend his cheeks...
Kristi Noem would call this weak sauce bro. She says its not humiliating enough bro. Get based bro. She only likes alphas who get pegged. Like Alex Jones.....
Wonder when the meatcanyon video is coming out
I detest this man. Who does that to a dog? That dog needs to be taken from him right away.
The absolute pos.
The hasan glazers here are crazy. Actual demons.
Hassan isn't very smart is he? 😂
There's no actual reason to shock his dog for no apparent reason. It's not like dog doing something bad or wrong.
But guys Isreal put that remote on my desk its not mine i swear
You can't hide the truth cuck-abi
The Mossad agents finally got Hassan from above.  KILL THE TURK!
What’s with the Xmas tree in oct
Hasan is spiritualy handicaped.
He's the toilet bowl skidmark of society.
i hope he gets his dog taken off him, vile humans like hassan who clearly is a sociopaths shouldn't be allowed to own animals.
I’ve been watching body-cam vids lately and I’m sure of this; Hasan is the mouthy guy who talks tough then sobs wildly the moment the cuffs go on. 😂
wait 7 months ago? the fact this didn't hit mainstream until now is horrible. this is one doxx I will not hate... get his house and call animal protection services
once shame on you twice shame on you thrice... STOP SUPPORTING A HORRIBLE PERSON
Kick his face in.
People are angry at a dog shock collar instead of the numerous statements he has made about supporting terrorists??
great!! there’s now denying it now.
Just imagine how many shocks that poor dog has sustained.
There is a good chance that the poor dog one day soon will disapeare. That hasun proved to be a psychopath. It's nothing for him to kill that dog.
kinda ironic how this beautiful doggo exposed what a despicable b*tch he is..
I don't see why people make such a big deal out of it... You do know these things have vibration mode too and you can set the shock from barely felt to max pain... It can be used "humanely" and lets not forget that some of us want a disciplined dog. I rather dicipline my dog 10 times well in a timely manner than fight them all my life. This being said I don't shock my dog. He responds great to the sound and vibration feature so the shocking part is permanently off.  Also he doesn't have a fucking Pug or Bichon. Big dogs have to be better mannered, more obedient, cause you can't fight a 40kg dog.
The only way to salvage his reputation is give up the dog to a more caring family
Hasan can't admit doing anything wrong because he suffers from chronic narcissism, reinforced by a lifetime of utter privilege  Admitting fault is literally beneath him.
do his fans actually care about this though?
I can't believe Israel left that there.
i enjoy this drama
He needs to put on that pad and made to lay there for 6 hrs straight.  If he moves the people on YT or on his stream get to push the button to put him in his place.
I was on his side for a while because there was 0 proof of there being a shock collar but now I'm already throwing in the Hasan glazer towel
How does he have so much shit as a socialist?😂
He is an ugly Nick Mullen.
Free Kaya!
✋😐🤚
setting up for Christmas before Halloween is evil
ITS LITERALLY OVER!!!  Lol... Calm down kids, he's called for literal violence against humans on multiple occasions...  I legitimately don't give a fuck. If he trains his clearly very well cared for dog with a shock collar... Don't give, a fuck.
Bro's not beating the allegations
Ladies and Gentlemen...  WE GOT 'EM
What I’m getting is that he does this shit all day every day. Poor dog.
Aasmongold you are a pathetic loser who sits in his basement being a “commentator”. Your fanbase is worthless. You are worthless, and serve no purpose in politics.
That also answers that Adin knew. And alot of other people.
We knew he'd slip up! It was just a matta a timee
He cant be THAT retarded can he?
The people who defended him must be feeling pretty stupid right about now.
I don’t know who Hasan is, but I’ve followed this whole saga from start to finish.  All I know is, after watching this gentleman lie over and over and over again, and repeatedly change his story, about a damn dog collar — well, if I followed him or watched him, I would be questioning EVERYTHING he has ever told me/said on video.  Seriously, this outrageous and incessant lying would make me not trust a word he has ever said, and it would call into question his credibility on everything he has ever stated before.  I say that because if he will go this far about a damn dog collar, what lengths would he go to, what lows would he stoop to, to lie about things far more consequential?  Dude appears to be a serial liar.  Oh, and he can’t even get his ass up and stop stuffing his face with food for two seconds, to help the lady (his girlfriend???) laboring and dragging the Christmas tree into what is presumably his own damn room?!  What a scumbag — can’t even be bothered to lift a finger.  On second thought, he reserves that finger to bzzzz, bzzzzz, bzzzzap his poor damn dog.  Gotta rest that finger so he can electrocute his poor pup.  Seriously, what a sorry excuse of a “man”!
the thought of giving out pain to an animal in capture because it doesnt obey -it is sick.
Why does he have a Christmas tree?
What to expect from a whore rider. Control freak. Champagner Socialist Incell
Now tell me his (not so) Young Turk uncle isn't the same kind of piece of shit. Runs in the family most often.
quick cast torture button for your live prop. is wild.
Thank God people are figuring out Hasan is a hypocritical turd
The official name is "ET-300 MINI EDUCATOR®"  "Educator"  You have to be fucking kidding me
Torturing your dog is a way to communist utopia if you think  about it. Hamas Piker
Tie him up in a room, wet the floors and throw the 430v in there. Mtfer
Socialists never admit mistakes, they just use the "and you more" and that's it.
Got em Now we must do everything in out power to make sure he doesn't weasel his way out of this ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
Israel planted that remote. Probably 🤔
Are we now done with this topic?! How long can this be drained for content, holy shit man
To weak to handle reality and truth. Like litteraly challenged like a todler, I hope someone makes it big unmasking this cesspool
Guess what, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN!=)))))
The Internet remains undefeated.
Whats more shocking about it? him lying or the dog was being shocked? who knows.. we are shocked too for this news!
This dumbass RECORDS HIMSELF doing to crime and get mad that everybody else noticed his dumbass doing the crime!
finally cancelled
It’s pretty obvious he abuses his dogs. Kaya is a live prop being used for Hasan’s streams and if she’s not perfectly in place then he gets angry and shocks or scolds her. This dude has the well known egocentric small le cock energy. There was also another video of him abusing and pulling the tail on his old dog “Fish” and yelling if Fish doesn’t stay then he will kill him. This dude shouldn’t have pets, it’s pretty obvious my guy has some god complex issues and should see a therapist. Also where the fck is his mom in all of this?
Why am I not shocked about this why poor Kaya has to deal with it all with that infamous collar?
Why do people suddenly care about this issue? Millions of these collars have been sold, and it's only bad when a YouTuber does it? If this is the hill you want to die on then please ban all the collars, not just this one specific person.
At this point the only saving excuse would be saying he Is gay for asmon
Mentally sick ass motherfucker
Hasan singlehandedly destroyed my respect for so many other people, just for being associated with him and openly lying to cover his ass, while constantly calling anyone else out for the smallest bullshit. At some people, eventho I liked watching them, I just can't take anymore. They are blaming anyone and anything for a situation like this, except for the one person who actively lies and manipulates them to think that way, despite all evidence proving the opposite.
hes a distraction a retarded distraction
What about Israel though
The best part of this video is him sitting there stuffing his face as a woman labors and drags a big Christmas tree into what I presume is his room, and doesn’t even bother to lift a finger to help her as she sets it up.  Wow.  Quite the man there.
This arabic terrorist subhuman being is so disgusting, I can't imagine what kind of people defends him.
The terrorist weapon of choice.
I legitimately thought he would have been canceled by now. How his dog has not been taken away from him is beyond me. Shock collars are illegal in California lol
Streamers getting SWATTED. For no reason.. Meanwhile this animal "TRAINER" does not.. Hmm something doesn't feel right.
It's even overer
"what i cant press mouse 2 to torture my slave dog? what kind of facist right wing american game is this ?!?!"
Even though this word has been used a bit too often lately, Hasan is the textbook definition of a narcissist: constant virtue signaling on streams to build the image of a “good guy”, while dodging responsibility by deflecting and lying/manipulating his viewers once getting caught doing something bad. No matter how strong the evidence is.  People like him disgust me the most. Especially knowing how many content creators (mostly streamers) are out there just like him.
From the room to the backyard Kaya will be free
Thank god for the power of Internet detective's 💪
This is the real genocide
The left are such fucking losers it takes this, an animal getting hurt for them to realise how self absorbed this prick is. Hassan is the perfect example of how you can never be born in to America.
0:20 look at his face 😂
i send him video how in gaza teach children under 10 hold gun and fight and i get bann very fast in 5 seconds this dud need get bann for life in all platforms and all people like him
Should call him Hadan, he no longer has a career. Hadan opportunity, best not to waste it.
He wont admit it because shock collars are againt the law in california
So what's the difference between him and Pirate Software exactly? Politics? Both are chronic liars.
At this point, bro is pathetic. I can't believe I used to defend this man.
* Trump voice *  WHAT a Dweeb.. What a loser
It was so suspicious how that corner was a blindspot despite his whole stunt of having a 4 camera setup. All that effort to hide that one corner and he still fucks up lmao
Hasan tomorrow: Shock collars can be a good thing TEN TOES DOWN.
He's a red flag🚩🚩🚩🚩 A dog like able
I've lost count of how many times I've seen people saying "it's over" now, you know, for it not to be over.
do you think he will be finally banned from twitch now?
PirateSoftware 2.0
There no way outta this your done
Hasan is very lucky i live very far away. As i would gladly save that dog from him.
What does peta have to say?
Just don't lie about it.  It's that's simple!
Hasan Clinton: "I'm going to say this again: I did not have electrical relations with that dog"
Asmon: ICE should shoot protesters Asmon: Palestinians are inferior Asmon: Hasan has no empathy
Only a lazy, callous, & self centered person would ever use a shock collar, especially on a puppy!  I don’t care how great of an escape artist your pet is, or if they’re ruining all your possessions. Just like with a child, once you choose to take on such a responsibility, it’s on you to either fix, prevent, or simply endure, the consequences of said commitment.  For example, we adopted an adult male cat only to realize we’d never be able to stop him from spraying the walls and furniture.  We chose to keep him even though it meant we’d have to work much harder to keep the house clean. But now that he’s no longer with us, I can honestly say that we never regretted our decision to put his happiness above everything else.
This is hands down the most fun online drama i've seen in years :D The sacrifice made by the hero who found it will not be forgotten! I cannot wait for his response now   Should change his name to Hasbeen
The spineless streamers that wont stand up against Hasan are the same ones pointing fingers at those that didnt stand up to Harvey Weinstein and telling their chat to be vocal and dont be part of the problem and to not look the other way. Now they themselves are part of the problem.
If even redditors are calling him out, that means he fucked up for real.
We all knew it was a shock-collar from Day 1.
He couldn’t make it more obvious even if he tried, honestly surprised he hasn’t blamed it on ai yet
Honesty is always the best policy!
Bros just a racist leftist that abuses animals. Thank god everyone is cutting ties with him
he got himself caught red handed
Make sanity great again. I dont like conservatism but right at this moment? The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
I don't understand why he even lied about it. Shock collars are some of the best, most reliable, and most often used training tools. It's not animal abuse to use a shock collar. (Of course, if you use it just to punish your dog, then it's pretty bad. But as a training tool, you'll probably only ever use it a couple of times, and it will be super effective.)
maybe it's a different model? obvi he's guilty it was proven a 100 times now but i don't see the buttons placed in the exact same spots. and quality is too fucked to rly see
Why is this dude still like top 2 streamer? Does he literally have to murder somebody on stream to be removed from society (and media) for good?  Where's the line cos I don't know. This guy has done abhorrent stuff. Played islamic terror propaganda. Displayed terrible ideas, speaking things like this will get you arrested in my country. Interviewed a honest to god terrorist. Now this. All while wearing this mask of empathetic left-winger.  Also, what kind of fucked up people sell electric shock collars?! Is this even legal? This isn't educational, this is straight up abuse lol. Imagine things like that but for children. Your 4 year old son is naughty? ZAP! LOL xD
Hasan about to move to phase 3. "I shock my dog, but it's not that bad and you're weird for pointing it out."
If he was using it correctly then why hide it? Exactly…
"Yer da shocks dugs" can now be attribited to Hasan
Isn't it crazy how lefties get the most controversy for being held to a higher standard than you all? It's kinda funny when you look think about it. Most of y'all don't even seem like you'd have any qualms about owning a shock collar, in fact you use collars, fences, etc. I don't even like Hasan, but maybe if you guys did the same there'd be a lot more decent people.
The President has a button on his desk for Diet Cokes, this jackass has a button on his desk for torturing his dog.
If it isn't a big deal and it's necessary, let's put it on him. Every time he lies, hit the button.
Lol why even lie about something like this? Lying about it made it 100% worse than just coming out and admitting it. It makes him look like an idiot every time it's shown that he's lying. Everything Hasan says is a roleplay. He plays pretend and acts like this virtuous intellectual and he is so ashamed when he's caught out of character lol.
Hold on.  Christmas in october?  What kind of AMERICAN shit is that?  I thought he hated America?
Btw, if you criticize Hasan over this, you're obviously Islamophobic. /s  The dumbass things people will say in his defense are unbelievable.
And he grabbed a donuts just to make people think his hand reached there for that donut. But the camera angle exposed him😂😂😂
muslim terrorist sympathiser tortures a dog ... and simps still try to defend him. what a sad world we live in.
Hamas piker is just a muslim shill sent by his masters to brainwash people into hating themselves and their country. It's time y'all realize it.
Is it a malinois? Yall need to stfu and stay playing wow.
People say that he looks guilty, but the thing is that he doesn't have such thing as guilt
Can’t stop people like him from taking hostages
The original clip was enough for me to be sold on it. Now it's just sad watching him and his sheep.
I remember Asmon's first video in which he covered this story; specifically the part where he asked ChatGPT in which countries shock collars are illegal. Anyone else notice they were all countries in which people of European descent make up the majority?   It really reminded me bout how most large-scale conservation efforts, like with the African elephant for example, or primarily undertaken by people of mostly European descent outside of Africa.   I'm telling y'all...nobody cares more about the safety and well-being of animals or takes animal welfare more seriously than European-descended peoples...
What important is not to let it slide, as if it's nothing. Because that's going to be the next line of defense of him and his leeches, 'cause nooo no one of them will be admitting anything.
On the next episode of To Catch an Abuser
Hasan promotes violence, sympathizes with terrorist groups, AND denies the Armenian genocide which I’m not surprised because “the young Turks” were a nationalist group in Turkey that invited violence against Armenians they literally pushed for the eradication of Armenians. Google his father you’ll learn about his political affiliations back in Turkey. Very interesting, not to mention, alarming.
Christmas tree? huh?
0:19 willem dafoe looking up meme
thats some poetic justice ,  originaly happenned on oct 7  valkyrae says "while there is a genecide and stuff"  Trump sign a peace deal between Israel and Gaza  now hasan is out of content and is now know as a liar ,a dog abuser and use his dog as a prop for his stream.
Why isn't' he wearing that shock collar yet?
Now we can cross reference the remote 💀
After all his many videos spouting his political / moral opinions, he will now only be recognised and remembered as the guy that shocks his dog during a live stream and then denies it
i mean you can tell by the dudes whole face that he is a sociopath
All could have ended if he just admitted that it's a shock collar lol
Twitch is funding it still
I'm curious to see what his followers are gonna come up with just to avoid admitting he shocked the dog and that he lied like the whole world is stupid
I'm sure he's of the opinion that anyone who disagrees with him needs a collar too.
Lying Ted? Nah, lying bb-b-b-itch
I really hope that poor dog will find a better home. There is no way animal rights would allow him to keep her
What's wrong about using such things on dogs? I would actually at 1st place not get a dog at all because pets are a fucking waste of time and you are an idiot if you waste time on dogs and not do something usefull.
You know even he thinks its a bad thing because he's trying to hide it 😂
You think that's bad? Just think what he's doing to his goat.
Wow he was lying? I can't believe this commie
RELEASE THE KAYA FILES.
he's taking it all out on that poor dog.
deport poopdullahs
Ah, what will Pokimane say now....
Hasans career will have a pulse after this, but im sure his dog will have many more.
“Neh bro!”… If he uses that…. F HIM!!! That shit is abuse.
It's a muscle memory means he's been doing this longer than we know it.
Are you telling me Hasan lies?! Noooo but he was always a based democrat communist of such unwavering principals he would never lie...
I don't understand why you torture him like this. It's not just the shock, but the fact that you treat him like an object, preventing him from moving freely. Why would that bother anyone? And if it bothers you, you shouldn't have a dog.
Broooooo
It's horrible, Hasan is a perfect example of a far left lunatic
lol. clown
Must be AI. Now all the silent people close to Hassan will start condemning him.
All the evidence and it won't change a thing :(
Glad I don't even know who the f*ck this clown is.
Hahaha and pokimane was going to fire all her staff 😂😂😂😂😂
there was never any doubt from the second you saw the clip and heard the dog yelp.  you dont need more evidence
I've been wathcing videos about Hamaspiker tilted "its over" for 3 years now.... somehow its never over.
Because what he is doing is wrong and he knows it and telling on himself when he hides it like a little boy
The most shocking thing after kaja is,  why is he putting stuff out for christmas ?
"he never admits if he's wrong even if it's something small" too bad he wont get the same treatment  as piratesoftware id love to see hasan go out the same way
Dogs are the real domestic abuse victims? Im pretty sure the dog will love its owner despite.
Caught in 4k
No way yall are still talking about this
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha Busted in 480p bro
Well he _is_ into Islamic Jihad and supporting terrorist groups that want said Jihad to happen more than anything so... is it really surprising that he treats his own pet violently?
How are people around him okay with his using a shock collar?
I almost feel bad 😭😭😭
I am shocked
Surely eventually he faces consequences... right?
He looked at the camera the same way those guys who get caught pickpocketing do 😂
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT HIM
And another obsessed post about Hasan 😂
Nah bro you can't fuck up this bad after this bad after this bad. What's the excuse this time ,,it was a friend's remote not mine". Seriously somebody should call animal control services.
What? It is real?
Fun fact: Thomas Edison would routinely engage in what can only be described as safety duels on the least dangerous way to use electricity for different applications like housing and employment and everyday uses. It usually involved starting with two stories one on each side the opinion never proven to be real and 2nd part always involved electrocuting animals of various sizes
A dog can't be spoiled. It is NOT a child. Why is free roaming bad? Cause hassan doesn't train his dog, he just controls her with a remote.
Like it's okay to have a shock collar. It's not okay to have it up so high it makes the dog scream. All he has to say is that he accidentally had the setting too high and he will make sure it doesn't happen again.
Twitch loves animals abusing people
The Israeli hostages in Gza didn’t even have shock collars. Hasan is literally worse than Hamas 😂
And now following the Democrat playbook, now that he’s been caught, he’s going to turn around and tell us that shocking the dog is good, and we’re wrong for not doing it
Everyone get in his comments and remind him he and his uncle belong in a kebab shop
Like we were second guessing it? We all knew the d*ckhead was just lying the whole time
Ladies the next time yore flicking the bean, rember...  how could his political views be correct when his body proportions aren't correct?
why does he need a Christmas tree as a muslim?
The problem is you assume his fans would care.  He is evil.  He promotes evil things.  I doubt a whole lot of puppy lovers watch him.  The fact that he tortures animals probably makes them like him more.  And we know police in California aren’t gonna do a damn thing about it.
the detonator now the bomb is planted.
Ok. You got him.
My question is ... WTF is he getting a Christmas tree for ?????
it's so jover hamas piker is done for.
Sam Hyde was right
I like how he awkwardly tries to hide it.
Nice job
Next he's gunna say "guys it was an AI video framing me"
Sometimes the truth is exactly what it looks like
The Collar of Peace
Hasan love  and thunder
Dude hasan has to be an idiot
hasan is  psychopath dude he will never admit to it. He hit on 15  and 16 year old girls at cons and in public when he used to do vlog walk around interviews and cut them from the final clips or just stop recording. We saw him do this in person when used to walk around our city and our college campus and go to our public rallies. There was video of him before 2020 telling a 16 year old girl he doesn't care about her age he just wants to know her hearts in the right place while standing so close to her you could see her hair moving from his breath asking for her snapchat and telling her she should meet him somewhere else. The video magically disappeared from all reddit sources and twitter and google when he got signed on by his uncle and became a millionaire off youtube and social media and was able to pay lawyers to have the video removed from all places under threat of legal action.
Lmao i knew he was lying when i saw him trying to say that people were just schizo thinking he shocked his dog ''because of how he moved his hand''. Well whos crazy now?
Wow…. Person who screams that violence is good is violent person…  But leftists still do eat that shi…
Why don't they ban this mfer Assan already? He always says everyone else is the bad guy but it's him.
AsmonFencesitterGold
The craziest thing isn't that he shocked his dog. It's that he lied, doubled, tripled down on the lie, then got caught in 4K, and it won't change A THING. His orbiters won't care, his fans won't care. Something broke in how we process information, and it worries me.
Twitch supports animal abuse.
Notice how he never once used it while the other people were in the room. Hmmmm. 🤔
Why is that dog still with him?
Hitler and Putin both treated/treat their dogs FAR better than Hasan. The true test of a man's character is how he treats the defenseless. Hasan failed.
Im not a fan of shock collars but i can understand why some people use them, especially if they know what they doing!  But putting ur dog in a corner for hours just to shock him if he leaves his corner is 100% abuse. He can argue its him training the dog but its more of a power dynamic at play. Surprised twitch is allowing such content on their platform.  Edit: the fact that he lied about it instead of saying he is training his dog shows he knows its wrong.
hasan fans are brainwashed by the b roach C
I caught a rare glimpse of Asmond's desk. A load of uncrustables wrappers, popsicle sticks and a hair brush. And an autographed picture of Mike Vick.
No it's not over until this cunt is banned from every fucking platform. He should have been banned for inciting his audience to commit acts of murder and terrorism to "spill blood on the street"
Again, I feel he needs his own collar, but the voltage required to make it useful requires a certain chair.
even looks at the screen to see the remote is out of shot
Damn!! The last time we saw someone get caught like this was in the Amber v Johnny case!  I can't wait for the fallout.
Dang Zeus really used refresher orb like we wouldn't notice 😂😂😭😭
The Internet wins again
So, I don't know Hasan, I don't follow him, I don't get wrapped up in politics, and so there's no reason for me to defend him unless I feel like there's no actual evidence. Looking at all the footage and reaction videos that I've come across, we haven't been able to actual confirm that he's used the collar as a "shock collar". The ET-300 is capable of being vibration-only, and the prongs are detachable. When he showed us the collar, there were no prongs on it. At this point, i think he's trying to "hide" elements surrounding the collar to avoid any more discourse/drama surrounding the subject, because he knows we already know that he uses the collar at all. We, as an audience, haven't actually seen the collar being used as a shock collar, with the prongs on. If you think about this in a court of law, there is reasonable doubt here, so we can't just claim that he's definitely using it to shock his dog. Some things are sus, I'll admit, like him claiming it was the dog getting her claw stuck that caused her to yelp, only to then admit that there was a training collar at all, essentially changing his story. I've heard that he's apparently a huge advocate for animal rights, and even supporting animal charities which, if true, don't line up with him wanting to use a shock collar; this doesn't disprove what's happning, but if it's true, then this casts even more doubt on the matter. It is POSSIBLE that he is shocking the dog, but there's enough reasonable doubt that we can't be sure. What I see right now are people jumping on this hating-bandwagon, something like cancel culture, because their bias/opinions of this creator are likely their primary fuel for wanting this guy to get in some trouble.
Bro just can't help himself 😭
This guy supports terrorists, but what will bring about his downfall is shocking his dog.
Bro is so used to having it close to his desk for frequent usage that he actually is starting to feel annoyed hiding it I'm totally not going to be surprised if eventually he gets so fed up he straight up says he uses it as training and just starts keeping it on his desk and uses it regardless of stream
It’s Over
This guy is cooked in every way, shape or form, yet Twitch refuses to ban him. Why is that?
He should buy a goat
I don't know who the guy in video with shocker is. But when you start shocking your dog, it's time to realise your not really a pet person. A'hole. So sorry for the dog, he'll be a nervous wreck. Best wishes all.
Why does he refuse to name what model it is? 😂
How many F ups does Hassan get before getting cancelled? Seems like he has an infinite supply.
Western world is over
How do people have this much spare time? 😭 Like, good catch for sure, but touch grass man.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah hasan is a serial killer waiting to happen with this kind of mentality
Hasan looked at jews so much he became one. The abyss stared back.
Seeing the truth is always such a. pleasure😂
The guy should not even be allowed pet rock. That rock would be dust from his abuse.
Honestly, if he was just honest from the get go, nobody really cares he uses the shock collar. People are mad because he is very deceiving about it. Just say "I misused the shock collar and reflect on my actions."
Look at his dumb face 🤣
1:14 Unintentional pun? If I had to bet on it... If I had Tibetan it.
Bro's never going to see the end of this one. 😂
Outsider here: Question to me is: Why did he choose to use that collar instead of a normal one? What about a professional dog trainer? Isn't that guy rich or something??
Psychopathic narcissists. These people are not human.
>Wears a shirt that says “eat the rich” >>Is immensely wealthy and lives a rich person lifestyle/wears expensive clothes >Is supposedly anti-fascist >Uses physical punishment causing suffering over the slightest infraction  Yeah, Hasan might actually be the most blatant fascist on the internet through his actions, not even NF would shock a powerless animal
0:01 somehow the shock collar returned
I wonder how his fans will rationalize this.
Wtf why nobody reports that to the authority's?
Why is Twitch platforming animal abuse?
He can't even manage having a dog under control like normal people do. He is such a weak excuse of a man.
One thing I haven't seen anyone mention at all is the fact he pushes a button, "we can all admit he pushes something even if you hate or love him, he presses something correct"  now if you're a streamer and a button gets pressed one of these things happens.  A sound effect B transition C camera change D something pops up on screen E mute F unmute  Nothing on his stream changes at that time, no sound, no transition, no meme pop up, no on screen action , nothing changes zero, even when you go and see the other clips where he is accused of using it, again nothing on his stream changes at all after the button press.  Also the dog gets on and off that bed how many time in all his streams yet never once catches it's paw. Not one single time ever. People are looking to see what there and defend it shocking the poor dog  or accuse it, but looks at what doesn't happen on stream tells you everything you need to know what really happened.
Can this guy get cancelled already?
i dont really care about this guy and his dog we experience so much worse on this planet. and yet you seem that you dont care about it. asmond you are a creep a liar and a hypocrite
Bro got caught in 4K Wide Angle and he's still gonna LIE about it.
And people will still defend him
How does this dude even have fans at this point
Y’know, I unironically started this off thinking that Hasan didn’t shock the dog, and despite my intense dislike of him that he wouldn’t be so fucking asinine that he’d do that on stream at the very least. I unironically thought that everyone was just piling on because they don’t like Hasan and have their own personal agenda (which, in some cases has happened before, again I fucking hate this guy too don’t get me wrong).  At this point I literally can’t believe that he didn’t shock the dog, or if it REALLY isn’t a shock collar (very unbelievable at this point) that he had that vibration on such an intense setting that it actively unnerves the dog to the point that its effectively acting like a shock collar.  Even then, this really wouldn’t have spiraled into such a problem if Hasan didn’t A) use the collar in such an inappropriate fashion on livestream and B) didn’t try to lie about not using the collar at all.
POS.
How in the fuuk this stupid piece of shit muslim scum still have his dog and its not paying fine? HUH??? oh yeee its america.. no wonder...............
What a fucking turd hammer of a supposed man this twat is. Put that around your neck and let us operate the remote. That shit bucket you call a head with no brain would be fried right off of those extremely weak shoulders you fucking bitch ass poser trying to be a man.
Its crazy how easy it is to train dogs with just positive reinforcement. And he thinks he is a good trainer by shocking his dog i can teach a dog to do everything his dog does in 1 day but i would not have his dog sit in one place for hours that is animal abuse in sweden ur dog is not alowed inside leashed to an inanimate object this dog is basically that but not litterally
Poor dog. 🥺
Someone in his area has to phone get this prick done man that's fucked up what a actual prick
Dude is shocking a dog to make him stay in the background of his stream for 10 hours while he spreads hate online. God help me, I despise this guy.
That dog needs to be removed from this guy immediately!!  And charges pressed against him!!
There's no law against shock collars
Such a sicko.
Send this to Valkyrae
He's geofenced his dog into a space the size smaller than a crate would be... Using the threat of, and occasional, electrocution to do it.
Hasan might as well come clean we all know he abuses Kaya. He knows he abuses Kaya. His sycophants know he abuses Kaya. California doesn't give a 💩. And Twitch won't ban him either because Dan Clancy sucks off Hasan in between jorkinit to Morgpie or other skanks with an OF
Hasan is no bro. He is the reason heroes exist.
This entire drama from Hassan using a shock collar to other streamers calling him out for it is fabrication by Twitch and them to keep  the audiences hooked and entertained. At some point, their content becomes stagnant and in order to avoid that, they deloberately create problems to get the attention of the viewers.
His reddit has pivoted away from it being a "vibration collar" now they are claiming it was just an 'airtag'
from the bed to the tv, Kaya will be free!
I am embarrassed for him.... Like tf you mean you still have the remote in the exact same spot still.......
pathetic animal abuser, hopefully someone will find him in dark alley
Can't admit he's wrong. Sounds like a Pirate we all know.
He even have a stuff dog, why don't he just use that rather than torture a real dog.
Why are people losing their minds over a simple barking collar? It seems so weird.  I'm assuming these folks have never owned a dog, lol
Bruh this is just clip farming atp we know he shocked his dog???? Not defending him but continuing to give him publicity is not the smartest thing
Aite no more debating. Its done. PEAT go get it. Its fkin over.
The issue is that it doesnt matter. His fans and defenders wont change their minds. He could straight up shoot that dog on stream and they would find a way to blame Asmongold, Ethan or Destiny for it.
Blame those who praise him to fame in the first place regardless of what he does and what kinda person he is.
He's a spoiled rich kid, he's never had to take accountability for anything, much less have to admit to being wrong lol
13% of collars commit 80% of the shocks.
Retarded retard retards again
hassan plz do a henry rollins "liar" video. the just to learn how to look cool with glasses on
Asmon streaming again and Hasan gettin canceled? What is this Christmas???
This guy should be studied for how much retarded people can be
Pathetic
Every muslim hates fascism and abuse of power unless he is the one in power.
Boom indeed
he has it out on his desk while he has friends over... "Hasan would never do that. he loves his dog" yeah right...
Kaia…SILENCE. I SHOCK YOUUUUUU
Obviously, it's a zionist deepfake. Checkmate, haters.
guys its a remote for his dildo..
His lack of accountability is admirable, takes a special kind of ignorant and stupid to make it look this seamless
He is actually stupid...
I hope the people who defended him are dragged through barbed wire.
Anyone mind explaining why this guy even has followers to begin with? Like genuinely?
He's a disgusting leftist fascist calling other's fascist. Can't make that sh*t up
One thing I learned from playing so many Ace Attorney games is that the more someone lies, the more it exposes the truth they're trying to hide.
it's gotta be REAL awkward to stay friends with hasan and not being able to speak up or ask him directly about this lol
He will gonna blame Netanyahu or Mossad psy ops.
What a subhuman he is.
It's interesting how he puts Antena towards Kayas bed so signal isn't lost and for the reason of not having to put up remote when using it. This guy is truly despicable and this is 100% shock collar.
Idk who he is but is he muslim? If he is why he had a dog?
terrorist-sympathizer and animal abuser, yeah, the horrible person allegations keep pilling up
If trash taste still friends with this awful human being, I'd actually lose respect to them...like seriosly
It's not funny. This dog is terrorized every day.
Refusing to admit you're wrong is a sign of narcissism.
not that shocking tbh
He is a narcissistic freak of nature.
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him
Imagine what he does to that dog when the camera is off :)   Watch him say in a year or two: my dog passed away...
Fukn animal abuser, compulsive liar, terrorist propagandist ham ass la streamer
the digital footprint.,...............
Q: How to tell if communist lies? A: Its mouth is open.
ladies and Gentlemen WE GOT HIM ! man what a ride
The low-life seriously needs a smack
Nobody is shocket but the dog
i want him to get cancelled so bad
It's all in the name isn't it. Nobody called Hasan can be a decent person
God there is nothing more satisfying than a shitlord lying and then getting exposed.
We got him!
This won't change the Hasan fans. They are okay to shock a dog
Disgusting
oh comon guys, we've all accidentally hit the shock collar remote button while reaching for food when our dogs just happen to be in the same room as us and just happen to be wearing a shock collar.
His dog needs to be taken away immediately. I hope he is not going to let loose all of his anger on this poor doggo after being exposed😢
e-collars are not shock collars
Just admit and claim it, just lying makes it worse, just shows what sort of person Hasan is
He is done!
lets see what lame excuse he comes up with
I'm just saying he deserves the Kirk treatment
This is literally the cold play situation again😂, if he not going to touch that, maybe no one will notice it
Why does he have a Christmas tree?
Lmao what a pos so fkn scary im no bitvh but id bitvh smack tf out this clown to show how much of a bitvh he or she actually is😂
Holy shit this is actually crazy
I'm calling John.
Swat his house
Love you brother but seriously I'm so sick of seeing this guy pop up in my feed. Seriously somebody just do away with him. Lock him in a box, throw away the key and come back in a month after he's left us.
Poor dog needs better attention and love. This “man” needs to be canceled asap.
Who watches this shit in the first place
As if i didnt despise him enough.
Bro hates abusers, he hates power and money, unless it's regarding to him.
So what did he gain by lying and what would he gain by telling the truth? Nothing. He lost as soon as he shocked that dog from the start.
What a nazi
Classic, he is either the abuser or the abused, no inbetween. We all know what kind of people have that simple mindset
What a total scuzbag.
Poor dog😢
imagine what he'd do to his slaves if it was still legal
Hasan Small head, small brain
Would you expect anything else from the left?
Like dude just admit you use a e collar some trainers use them some don't some people will hate you for it but way more are going to hate you cause you lied and because you miss use it
0:37 hum why wouldn't he finish the phrase? :s
Charlie Kirk that Hasan Piker
God what a piece of shit. You know this dickhead would do this shit to people if he had the chance
Alot of people are low key scum
0:46  - the collars actually got probes on the back of it.. jesus.. now i understand when that women said the collar was to tight, she barely could get 1 finger between it.  and chunks son starts speaking ''yes but its..'' he stops himself from finishing the sentence on stream;  ''yes but its to ensure a good strong contact between skin & electrode''    walking the mile, walking the mile..
Hes so clueless, why do people listen to him dribble nonsense?
Yo fuck Hassan. What an ass
@xqc
What leftists mean when they say they have to educate you
Wheres the cancel culture now
the remote for the vibrating collar is exactly the same.........
The internet has a very good way of investigating people it thinks are bad guys.
Can't believe I'm saying this But hitler himself respected animals including his own dog which was why he became vegan
he caught on HD quality
He was caught in 4k ultra 1080p. Even saul goodman can’t get hasan off he’s caught with his hand on the button
Okay so twitch and other sites can ban you for some stupid reason, but electro shocking your dog live is okay?
What a strange thing to do period. Just goes to show all this guy cares about is how he’s perceived and not who he actually is. But we already knew that 🤷‍♂️
Evil fucking cunt to do that to an animal
I'm not shocked at this point
Fake, the dog is moving around
My puppy is 6 months old and he listens to what I say because i taught him with love not torture
Free kaya from the Ziplord Darth Hasan
I've seen enough. That nigga guilty! I've got the rope right here!
Muslims hate dogs, or many of them at least think they are filthy animals who are way lower than humans on the ladder.
If he's so innocent why don't he just wrap the collar around his neck and elctr- i mean vibrate himself in front of the camera.
I bet hes choking his dog off camera for getting him in trouble
Just hope some psycho shoots this torturing piece of shit one of these days.
That guy is literally the guy that in one second talks about violence in the world and in the other second shocks his beloved dog. Thats the world we are living it LOL
Will this be the 4th and final step? A.K.A " People freaking out about it are the real problem".
Did he see the other bitches on twitch doing the shock collar meta and get confused?
So this guys is STILL not banned from Twitch or anything? or suspended?  ...Nothing? Isn't animal abuse against the platform's TOS? Can I just go on Twitch and electrocute a dog on camera and be fine and famous too?
Needs to periodically torture his dog so he can keep it together, I hate him even more now lol!
Save that dog from that worthless piece of crap.
Bro just keeps fucking himself over
So how many times does it have to be over to be actually over? Because I want this piece of shit in ruins which will never happen since he's close to Cenk and all the other filth.
Osama diddy shock piker his is name
People who use shock collars are just shitty owners I cant stand those who use them just the worst kind of scum. Why even have a pet if you are only trying to traumatize it, he probably doesn't even understand what positive reinforcement means and thinks just zapping the dog is the only way for it to obey you. Animals should feel and be part of a family and not be subject to this.
Like bruh. You screwed yourself. They know the brand and that it shocks her. So one you fucking lied and two you really had to look at the camera like the guilty fuck you are. The 2nd point was the cherry on top for me 🤣☠️
Peaceful community. Few years ago they treat their women the same way. Dogs/women no rights, no protest.
It makes me cry when i imagine the life this dog has
So socialist that he celebrates most capitalist holiday
You don't mess with internet people who have time to spare.😂
Hes a muslim what do you think they all are abusers and narcissists.
Trump rapes children and all you people care about is whether or not some person shocked their dog. Asmongold fans are probably as dumb as they get. Fucking weird ass incels.
Can we tase him for 2 hours straight. that would be great
I always said, a sign someone is a pathological liar is that he never admits to lying.
He already has a toy dog right there, and it won't even try to move, why not use that as a prop that he actually wants
Ive been arguing with his dumb fans who keep excusing all his behavior claiming hes sweet to her alll the time which is completely made up.  And then they said that hes forcing her to stay on her bed for hours because of her joints.  Again, my dogs big too, you absolutely do not need to force a dog to sleep on a bed either. If it feels good to her she will do that. My big dog will sleep on the floor and sometimes on the bed. If it felt bad to him he wouldnt fucking do it. What a dumb excuses
This is on par with DSP guilty look after jacking off
Okay, we have the green light to send him home, bye bye asshole!
So hes a coward a liar and an abuser.
ANNNNDDDDD there goes the last 1% of doubt. Hope all those coping clowns clowns finally give up.
Guys, dont you see, it is known that mustachio was good with dogs(animals) so clearly because H is not he can not be fascist :)
I can clearly see his Pants on fire.
Is it true that hassan is cenk's nephew?  I just learned this... wtf is everyone a plant for political purposes?     Also hassan is a fruitypie!
Nasty turk
this whole saga is going through all the stages of the narcissistic prayer.
The real irony of this is had he done nothing it's not likely anyone would have noticed because you can't even tell  what it is off the bat
He’s always been trash. This is just the icing.
SHOCKING
"Thou shalt suffer a terrible fate should thee trigger the autists of the internet."
What a monster!!
Wait, why are they bringing in a Christmas tree?😂
animal cruelty, that a TOS of life.
Oh my God, he actually looked up at the camera like a looney toons villain. What an absolute clown🤡😅
I dont know who this dickhead is but i hope the rest of his streaming career is over/miserable
Regardless of whether he is shocking to dog or not, why tf isn’t this guys dog allowed to move when it wants to? You want to use it as a prop for your videos?
Damn this dude has that thing on quick select, right next to WSAD.
We will now enter the "okay, it happened but it's a good thing" phase.
Dudes a class 1 narcissist .. he's a weirdo
Who tf cares
So he uses a shock collar to train his dog , that ain't illegal.
as expected of a generational pseudo intellectual hamas piker hahaha
And then he pretends he just wanted a cookie :'D man...this is peak comedy
Imagine how confused the dog is now that it finally has some freedom
But why he is not taking down from social Media? Is twitch supporting animal abuser?
It's the ET-302, the 300 was the previous model, and the back, just to the top left of the electrical tape, there's a hole, which is only on the ET-302, but both use the RX-090 shock receiver, so I guess I'm just being specific.
I mean all content aside he genuinely is shocking this poor dog for no reason like how is this guy still even relevant I really don't get it or better yet not in jail.
Take his pet away from him, he's not fit to own a pet
Classic lefty.  Sellfish self obsessed narcissist hiding behind the veil of liberalism.
Guys it's just his huge car keys calm down. He isn't a bad guy😂😂😂
Muslims Hate Dogs because they would Bark at night time when men would sneak into the prophets house for sex
I dont know why anybody fucks with twitch theyre all like that. Theyre sociopaths from a talent agency playing characters but then passing judgement on others while in character. Its all fake and corporate coopting of popular hobbies for money and political control
A blessing they are stupid as fuck.
the mage hide the scroll
Wow, Hasan was lying this whole time? SHOCKING!
He’s a pathological liar
Cooked
Imagine shocking your dog so much that you have the remote in hands reach ALL the time like that? When he said he used the vibration just when shes running crazy in the park...
The good thing with evil idiots is that they're idiots. Hasan is a massive idiots 😂😂😂
Revolt, off with his head! XD
The fact that he felt compelled to hide it is admission that he knows what he is doing to that dog is evil. If he genuinely thought what he is doing is okay, he would never think to be sneaky about it. His cult will never understand that, though.
1:18 "He never admits that he's wrong even about like anything really small".  Reminds me of a certain pirate 😂
Sociopaths exist, good morning.
It’s literally in his DNA to be torturous! And that science
Save that dog 😢 this is bad
At this point I think admins and hasan just work together to get views lol
I dont understand what the issue is?
Hasan should where it on stream. Everytime someone donates he gets a shock😂😂
Bro has always been a huge piece of shit, this is just MORE video evidence.
Brooo why is he keeping this up, this is more funny than serious anymore hehehe
Now we need to cancel his abusing ass. He shall never have a public carreer again, may he rot in hell.
After this video ,and him denying everything after the earlier stream clip I can confidently say this man should find the one tree that is producing oxygen he's wasting ,and say sorry to it.I don't wanna say what else in my opinion he could do by that tree because it's against ToS xd
this is ok shock collars give free robux
How absolutely disgusting, this loser should never be allowed to own a dog or any other animal for that matter if this is how he treats them as if they were a piece of background scenery in his cluttered room full of crap. I'm 65 and I've loved and lived with over ten dogs throughout my life so far, i've gone through grief and loss but most of all and most importantly LOVE from them. They are MORE than worthy of our attention, affection and care. These beautiful animals love unconditionally and are loyal to those they consider close and then this guy just treats his as nothing more than a money maker. It makes me sick to my stomach that this man considers this torture as " training ". This sweet dog needs to have the normal freedom to roam and walk as she pleases, keeping your dog confined to a specific spot for hours on end isn't apart of any " training " I've heard of, it's just straight up abuse ontop of the fact this loser shocks his poor pup to keep it complacent. What a sick individual, I can't imagine how he treats her off of camera.
People are calling for Hasan Piker to go to jail but nothing ever happens.
Poor dog man that’s insane. I’ve always had dogs . they don’t need that much training to just be a house dog bro. they basically just need potty training .. no nipping , and then no jumping on people and that’s basically all I’ve ever taught my dogs and every single dog I’ve had since childhood has never bit anyone and died of old age . idk what narrative this dude is trying to push but zapping your dog because it moves from the corner is abusive.
Exactly!!! Just say you’re wrong and apologize. Idk hasan or think he some evil dude but the lying and covering it up just to protect his image is just weird. Just take accountability and move on.
muslims hate dogs, that why
Welp, Pegasus banger incoming.. take it away Jellywig 😂
The only time that poor dog gets rest is when people are over. And get love and affection not saying that theses animals are affectionate no anyone who knownly lets a animal get abused like this isn't affectionate just pretends and again poor dog 🐕😢😢😢
Thats turks everyone. Stay away and boycott everything turkish.
Arent dogs haram? Bad muslim. Muslim bad!  He should have worn the collar instead of his victim of pleasure
Watch his goons now pivot from “he was just reaching for his Zyn” to now “Shock collars are legal and normal, why don’t you care about Gaza ?”.
The loonies will continue to support him just because he is ANTIFA. At least we know who is the enemy, they are in plain sight. Its so sweet to see them all removed step by step.
heck thats a lot faster than i thought it would be with such mellow rollers
Notice how the dog goes nowhere near him. But is super affectionate towards everyone else… really sad man.
Im shocked!
Hahahahahaha
Take that poor dog away from this co*ksucker, if he likes vibrations he should let the dog out of it
Sick bastard. Like... Just admit it at this point. Sociopath... Literal sociopath.
his a turkish hypocrite streamer his only content is to ragebait people in youtube.
He is so stupid. LIke actually so stupid. You can see the train of thought, like from a fkin movie : 1. Oh no it's visible. 2. Panic, immediately move it. 3. Oh let me fake the movement by grabbing the donut despite there was clearly different movement. 4. Let me check the camera with the most "I am fucked" eyes possible. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP.
dude is a psychopath.  Nothing even registers as wrong to him.  Clearly didn't get told no as a child and sure as hell didn't get his ass tanned for throwing a tantrum.
Im shocked.
hasan defenders in for some serious over time after this one... sheeesh
It's not the collar so much as it is the overt attempts at deception, berating people and blatant lying and cover-up. I do feel for the dog and anyone around this tyrant, though. I hope his following drops away after this. What a pathetic excuse for a human beinf.
I don’t really want to defend him but his dog has a lifted cot and a shock collar. Two of my dogs have the same thing. You don’t have it turned up to shock them in a painful way. It’s more of a slight buzz to get them to pull their attention away from whatever the distraction is and look at you. Lots of training use this method.
i mean... that could only come from someone whos name is something like hasan?!  the region he comes from is full of hate and freaks.
k9/11 keeps getting crazier
very sick terrorist behavior
fucking insane
Why do people who dont want dogs get dogs? I'll never understand this...
What a lying psycho
So people called CPS on Ethan for a made up story about his kids eating dogshit and here's Hasan actively torturing his dog. Idgaf if he "Walks her for hours before stream" because I simply dont believe thats true. I dont think anything matters to him except the stream.
he is so done...
Nothing is ever over.
Nah guys you don’t get it, Kaya is so spoiled. That’s for the shock collars he has on Ludwig and Valkyrae… 😂
Why I always witness people on the left, trying so hard to show how virtuous they are, falling into absolute ugly behaviours...
Why would a Muslim get a dog anyway? they hate dogs
Raiden hit another combo into fatality
most sane far-leftie streamer. And for some reason believing that god is real is insanity to these psychos
I just don't get it. Why do so many losers watch this loser (Hassan I mean!)?? ...Oh. I think I just answered my own question! HAHAHAHA
So when are we going to take action?
Somebody save that dog
Hasan:no guys its for my christmas light u see.its not shock collar i promise.
I swear to god his orbiters will look at this evidence and STILL defend him
Everything he preaches is void. Shock collars are banned in some countries. Using it to force your dog stay in one place in your streaming room is ridiculous. The guy makes a living on preaching what he thinks is right from wrong, yet this is the type of person he is. WTF.
This years new series HassanSoftware is startng off great.
Hasan should wear this collar ... with a little bit more power ;)
I knew it. I knew this was a shock collar
None of this matters, hassans crowd just don't care.
I'm shocked by this. You're shocked. Even Hasan's dog is shocked.
yeah he did it
And nothing will happen to this Hamas member, Twitch allows it.
lmao
I bet he does more to that dog off screen in bed!
Yo, im actually shocked!... Nooo, Im  not Hasan's dog...
i wonder what the hassan fans are going to now
you expected that hasan guy to be a good person?
Master Rank #1 Gooner Daniel "Goonsanabi" Clancy can't save ya this time Kid Thunder.
Hasan is on Santa’s naughty list no doubt about it now
He acts like a bitch, he argues like a bitch, he can't take criticism like a bitch. What is it with modern lefties behaving like women?
I hate to sound like _that_ guy, but I doubt Hasan will face any punishment beyond a <24 hour ban on Twitch and having to make a hollow apology.
Please ban and get rid of this worthless water bag.
😂😂😂😂 got em
So im betting he will eventually say he isnt going to keep the dog on stream anymore. He'll claim its due to people lying about treatment so hes removing the focus of haters. In reality he wont be able to tolerate having to interact with the dog rather than forcing it into the corner.  This will be become a problem because now people are watching for slip ups and he really doesnt like the dog and he cant abide not being center of attention for even a second and having to per his dog for show.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Holy fuck
Got em
There are so many lines on this graph that it could make a picture of the incident.
And that's that, he.. not moving
Hasan is not an American, He and his family are Turks through and through. It's time for these people to be expelled from our country.
And that's that, he.. not moving
Hasan lives to lie.
I'd like to see the massive cope they will do with this 😂
Narcissistic personality disorder Sociopathic personality disorder Psychopathic personality disorder Psychotic tendencies  Hell is real Many people will end up In hell Accept Jesus as lord by acknowledging he's God the creator of everything, who became human to die for your sins  This world is pure evil Humanity is pure evil The end of the world will come
call it dog training utillity.. i call it animal abuse period.
i really realllyyy realllyyyy dont like hasan i wish him the worst what a looser he is
Allegations keep pilling up. I wonder how much longer until someone does something about it.
What hypocrisy what about the people who were killed in Palestine
Unless we know what setting he uses and how much it hurts, or doesnt, we can't really make any call as to its cruelty. It could be no worse than a vibrating collar, or it could be really painful.
This prick shouldn't have a dog. Doesn't deserve one. Shocking your dog? What an absolute arse wipe, I hope his dog bites him.
at this point this has to be on purpose.
It's literally on the side he always reaches. . Just admit you're trying to turn your dog into a hot dog
This is bad but let's not forget Kristi Noem shot her young dog instead of surrender to local shelter and Trump appointed her head of DHS for being tough.
The internet remains undefeated. Poor Kaya hope she gets to be a dog one day and not be a prop. Yo where's those animals rights organisation when you really need them !!!!
Hassan is a POS.
We know he is an abusive piece of garbage, a waste of space really, but do we have to keep repeating the dog's abuse? Watching this shit makes me beyond angry and it breaks my heart. His fans are just like him and don't give a fuck, so re-watching the abuse is just horrible and unnecessary. Ugh.
Im not saying animal abuse is fine at all but what will people do anyways life just keeps moving people will still go back to watching him.
Sociopath -Antisocial personality disorder is a personality disorder defined by a chronic pattern of behavior that disregards the rights and well-being of others. People with ASPD often exhibit behavior that conflicts with social norms, leading to issues with interpersonal relationships, employment, and legal matters.  Anyone want to complain to twitch about animal abuse? This guy has to go he is 1000% a sociopath and lies and crashes out every other day while threatening everyone. He has to go .
It would be if his fans werent actually mentally retarded. They are the dumbest people and will deny their own eyes and ears to believe the people they look up to arent vile sociopaths. Hes also on video talking about tying the dog to its bed to train it to stay in place for hours. On video pulling a dogs entire weight by its tell. His reaction in the first shock video made it clear he was guilty because he began stumbling to cover.
Can someone fucking snipe that human garbage. Not because of his different political view. No because of plain garbage.
Dude's a sociopath.
I hated Hasan before it was cool.
i think he’s one of the biggest narcissists of all time i’m not gonna lie
Its just a shock collar bro if you dont like him using it just dont watch him its not that big of a deal.
Only time we see the dog wag her tail is when she is with other people
find him
He could have just said sorry i used it. Im an idiot and didn’t know you weren’t supposed to lol  All this lying makes it so much worse
The diversion of going for the cookie, lol
-*tell everyone its a vibration collar* -*Never show it vibrate* 😂
Hassan is literally the facist.
lmao
"Kaya if you dont pretend to love me on stream, I'll press the button..."
Cant wait to see how Hasan and his fans are going to try to cover this one up now that he practically gave people the smoking gun. The fact that he keeps it that close and ready on his desk says a lot
I was gonna call him a R*tard but thats an insult to people with disabilities to put this guy in their category.
What a shocker, isn't it?
This is a solid confirmation.
Bruh people still on about this? Obviously it's the remote for his butt beads that he was using to cheat at chess with. /s
So, Hasan is a psychopath, a hypocrite and also a narcissist
He is so stupid
Now this makes his friends who tried to stick up for him and called it vibration collar look so much worse lol
I'm starting tl wonder if he does these things on purpose...
This is the left. They don't care about facts. They don't care about what is natural. They won't to impose their views and distorted version of reality on you at ALL COSTS!
He is literally admitting it is wrong by moving it out of frame. If he thought it was right, he wouldn't hide it.
I still remember people insisting that it wasn’t a shock collar
He kept the remote there?! 🤯
Everyone who was namecalling people for saying it was a shock collar shouldnt be allowed to speak on the internet ever again
Cute that people actually think this cretin will face consequences, evil is protected in 2025.
That poor dog...
@moresus
this fucking degenerate
A) i have no idea who this hasan guy is B) there is nothing wrong with owning a shock collar for a dog C) I have no idea why this newsworthy or why anyone has anything to say on the subject. There like ten streaming platforms, all the worlds knowlege in the palm of your hand and you losers are watching this
There is now only one way for him to save himself. Wear the shock colar, and let chat activate it with donations.
Liberal trash narcissistic dog abusing rich kid
Shoking news, he did It.
I mean I was never a fan of the guy but knowing he legit abuses his dog by forcing it to sit in one spot for four hours then punishes her for having the audacity to be a dog and move just makes me not like him even more.
Someone needs to use a cattle prod on him.  Drain the battery on that thing.
It's Over, Isn't It?
I’m glad this happened if it’s anything people can agree on, it’s do not hurt the dogos!!
the antenna on it is also pointed towards that direction 😂
Asmongold has pet rats at home, why didn't he share his pet taming tips with Hasan?
you’ve made like 5 videos about this, surely there’s more important shit going on
destroy his channel and save the dog from this imbecil. Let him work at McDonald's maybe he understands that torturing animals is forbidden
Free Kaya
Crazy how obsessed Asmon is with Hasan. I don't like the kid but every other video is about him..
gotcha bitch
Fuck Hasan. He is all covered in lies. He is fake and stupid person.
Hasan is like Hamas. He is keeping a hostage. This is why he likes terrors organizations so much.
The guy is a lying piece of sh*t and his followers are all maggots
he is aware that's why he was hiding it he knows what lies he was doing that's why he hides it  seriously I wanna see those who supported him, and gaslit hasan's dog like they were a loved dog and given really great care. like fck you ! you should look at your own dog instead of telling naive people that hasan's dog is loved.  he. is. an. animal abuser. people protecting him are hypocrites.
0:20 😂😂😂
Nothing ever happens to Hasan. He keeps getting away with it
Stop saying it's over and fucking finish it. Like damn how much proof do you need to see he abuses tf out of his pets.
PETA: *looks away
Ok so, plus animal abuse
"boom" lol
FREE KAYA😢
Welp the one guy that said its so over was right lmao
He a man child that needs a good old adjustment here's hoping karma is watching.
You know he's gonna throw that remote and the collar away at any chance before someone sends cops to search for that.
mussies are bad..who knew?1
dam son he just like piratesoftware frfr
You'd think he would remove it from his desk when this whole thing started
Bro literally put a video on that WE are the ones lying 😅😅😅😅
And watch as he never mentions it again and ignores anyone talking about it hoping it’ll blow over like so many of his past controversies.
Hasan and the egyptian cat godess got something in commen. Both are Busted.😂
No, it's his omibod vibrator for his next live stream on OF
From 98% to 99.9999% now - dude abused and shocked the shit out of his dog
Hassan Simps and leftists, "Trust me it's a rare limited edition Vibrator Hassan made from a shady Mexican repair shop. It's definitely not a shock collar. Why don't you believe me?"
The sad thing is Kaya is not getting shocked anymore only on stream. 😢
From the sofa to the tree, Kaya will be free ❤
Imagine now that a man with this attitude to power was actually put in charge of human beings. Is his real surname Stalin?
corruption is only bad if im not involved
I mean the guy wears pearl necklaces and paints his nails. It only makes sense that he would also abuse an animal.
Remember these are the things we can only see…
Can't wait to see Twitch do nothing with an animal abuser.
It’s beyond me that there’s people who continue to defend this insufferable prick.
Cenk's gonna have to come out and talk about Assman and Jagermeister wanting to enslave, silence, and kill people again. Somebody's gotta run interference for Hasan.
I shouldn't laugh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wtf 😮
Typical communist
مخادع
Ladies and gentlemen  We got em
If its just a vibrating collar and he thinks he did nothing wrong, why is he hiding ir then?
Lock him away and give the dog a better owner. Hasan rly out here with his own version of the watergate scandal
dog is haram
Who cares?
And dont forget, he justified kaya pushing bounderies without the shock same like kids.  So when this dude becomes a father, his kids wont get bounderies unless he tolds them to. His way of discipline and training is like this and he doesn't understand why it is wrong.
Again?
I would imagine if he had mentioned it early on that he has a shock collar for his dog, that most people wouldn't worry about it. I mean it is a common dog disciplinary item, not a nice one but it isn't illegal or hard to come by as far as I am aware.  I am just more surprised he has a dog, given that in his parental homeland of Turkey, dogs are treated really poorly and seen as vermin.
MINI EDUCATORS ARE NOT SHOCK COLLARS!!! Firstly, I am NOT defending Hasan as I can’t stand him, but it’s important to educate you all. My family has a dog training business and we use educators all the time. They do NOT shock, they vibrate and if you’re on the PROPER power level, it should be like an equivalent to getting tapped on the shoulder because it lightly stimulates the dogs neck muscles to get their attention. Average level can depend on the sensitivity of the dog, but we use them from power ratings anywhere between 5-25. 30-50 is for dogs who are VERY distracted and quickly need to have their attention refocused. From how his dog reacted, I suspect his level is in the 60-80 or even higher because I think (I’ll have to check cause I’ve never gone to the max) the highest is like 100-120 which IS PAINFUL for dogs and acts more akin to a shock collar  For Hasan to carelessly do that shows he has no regard for his dog’s pain tolerance while abusing the tool that supposed to be used to attention redirection, which is a huge red flag, and I find that worse then him outright using an actual shock collar. The fact that Hasan isn’t even mentioning this obvious detail shows he has no idea how to properly use the equipment for its intended purpose
Those are just his perosnal shock collar. 🙄
Guy is a huge POS already, why any braindead idiot watches his garbage stream is incomprehensible
That he uses a training shock collar doesnt mean hes wrong about Israel. Hope ur degenerated community gets that! 😂
His supporters will still deny
If this guy gets cancelled he is going to kill his dog. Drop this subject for clout before the dog gets hurt even more.
He's such a weirdo
so it was next to the other remote that was for the vibrator that was up his ass. i hope someone puts the dog collar on him while he is asleep
Ok cool so we now know. But what now? Not like people have stopped watching. If anything more people are now watching. The internet is annoying with these things. People act like they care but do nothing and don't change habits. People will still watch.
What do you mean “small”? Glorifying internationally condemned “tera” groups is a huge f.up already! This one here is nothing more but a cherry on top of the pie…
I don't shock my dog, okay?! I shock my dog, but rarely, okay?! I shock my dog, but it's good, okay?!
Hasan going down for animal cruelty and not inciting terrorism is poetic 😂
I like how he decided to lie, gaslight, lie, insult, and lie again, over and over, rather than simply address it. 😂 And I assume he's been trying to use it less because he's complaining about the poor dog "running the show" because she's stretched her legs a few times.
never admits he's wrong, where have I heard this one before 🤔pirat
I wonder what script is he gonna hand to his "Friends" this time to defend his ego 😅😂
Disguting that instead of talking about the hostages returning after 2 years you talk about that crap. Racist c*nt
Imagine thinking you're smarter than the entire internet. This is "Don't Fuck with Cats: Dog Edition"
It’s actually the button for Dan Clancy’s collar. He insisted to Hasan that he needed this to feel satisfied.
No cockroach escapes the Roach King's gaze
its leftism in a nutshell. they can never be wrong so people will only see how right their way of thinking is.
AMERICA DESERVED DOGTOBER 7TH
I agree that the dog has more worth than asmongold. But please dont shock it just for moving, like that it wont learn anything. Other than that its not cruel at all to use those collars moderately.
No guys, it's remote for his vibrator that he shove inside his azz,you know he's exhibitionist like that 😔
It's never over.  We all know Twitch will do nothing.
This clip feels like a sting operation conducted by Hasan’s multiple angle cameras
Get 4Chan involved  If there’s one thing they viciously hate above anything else    It’s Animal abusers
Caught red handed yet again. The problem is he looks so sussed as well but still in denial 😂
Funny thing is that he DID admit to using it a while back
The internet is still undefeated man. Hasan should have learned that.
Poor dog
Subject: Urgent Concern: Animal Welfare Case — Use of Shock Collar on Dog During Long Streams  To Whom It May Concern / Dear [Department / Officer / Sir or Madam],  My name is [Your Name / “a concerned viewer / member of the public”]. I am contacting you about a matter of serious concern involving a dog named Kaya, which appears to belong to streamer Hasan Piker. During his livestreams (sometimes lasting 8 hours or more), Kaya seems to be prevented from moving freely by a shock (or static) collar.  I have observed the following (please see attachments / evidence links below):  Timestamped video / screenshots showing Kaya restrained or restricted movements  Duration and dates of streams during which this occurs  Any additional context (e.g. camera framing, commands, any visible signs of distress)  This practice raises concerns about potential animal cruelty, neglect, or violation of local/state animal welfare laws. It is my firm belief that Kaya’s welfare and comfort should not be compromised.  What I respectfully request:  That your office investigate this matter to determine whether local ordinances or state laws are being violated  That you provide any possible guidance or intervention to ensure Kaya’s well-being  That you keep me (and the public) informed of any findings or steps taken  Attachments / Evidence:  [Attach screenshot(s), video clip links, timestamps]  [Any observed metadata or relevant commentary]  Thank you for your attention and for any action you take on this matter. If needed, I can provide further information or help coordinate with other local animal welfare or legal agencies.  Sincerely, [Your Name] [Contact email / phone — optional]
How is this guy still allowed to stream? He's abusing his dog, that's against Twitch TOS. How is he not banned yet? Genuinely do not understand.
What a animal abuser.
Hassan is a weirdo always has been 😂
Don't even know about that stuff , so this is a legal product ?
Poor doggo.
Hitler loved dogs so it's ok to hate dogs- hasan supporters probably
Can someone rescue the dog from that fascist?
He constantly admits that he's wrong about everything really. Any time he opens his mouth and talks about money, politics, economy etc.
If Asmon killed a bug on stream, he'd be banned and crucified.
Asmon fans when kids dying:🤪 Asmon fans when dog getting tazed:🥺😱😡😡
its crazy that they actually sell shit like this. unhuman.
He got himself 😂
Lock him up!
What I don't understand, is that if he doesn't want people to know he uses a shock collar on his dog, why is he brazenly shocking her live on stream? His behaviour makes no sense at all.
Promotes and supports terrorist gourps no problem. Shocks a dog CANCELLED
You know when you adopt a dog at a shelter, and the person says they don't like the word "Example"?  Or they don't like a certain object like, "Example"?  The reason why is because of this.  He's not training his dog, he's abusing his dog.  If he gives that dog to a new owner, the vet is going to have to explain that the dog doesn't like buttons, and is afraid of the word spot.  How fucking terrible of a human being do you have to be to understand that?  How can these devices exist and there are no laws against it?
nothing has changed, the dirt bags will defend him, he'll still reside in his mansion spewing hate to people he cannot stand including youths, further poisoning their minds as he dreams about installing the caliphate in America under the guise of socialism or some bullshit.
I will said it again for the third time..Somebody gotta call John Wick
Ladies and gentlemen i present to you, "The Anti-Fascist."
To put it into context. Asmongold is nicer to the roaches in his house, then Hasan is to that dog.
Hasan is a furshist! Revenge for Kaya!
It that woman his MOM cleaning his room??
The vast majority of people dislike animal abuse. It's so deep in us that we'll put other stuff we'd often argue about to help a dog/cat.
"It's over, we know"
Bro, his name is hassan, what do you expect from someone with this name?
What was that he said? Observable reality? 😂  God, you gotta be really stupid to believe that nut.. Honestly.. They wouldn't know reality if it hit them in the face...
Like a true commie... As soon as they have a modicum of power they abuse it.
Yep, 100% proven. And 0% chance anything will happen to him.
Caught in 4K!
Release the dog and put the collar to him instead
So we  gonna cancel a dog abuser right?? right?
wow a mooslim turk thats a soulless animal abuser? SHOCKING!
Clear display of narcissism to deny ever being wrong. Not that anyones surprised.
Owning such a thing (bar legality) not a big deal. Misuse and abuse redflags everywhere. Shock collars aren't inherently dangerous but they serve a very different use to this.
Isn’t animal abuse illegal? How come the authorities have done nothing about this? The evidence is on video.
Watching Asmon laugh at the downfall of this abusive, entitled idiot is the cherry on top. The only thing that could make this better now is the feds coming for Hasan for inciting violence. Lets watch the tough guy handle a federal prison.
Hasan hates his dog.
Just another hypocrite woke in the long list
He’s so lucky I don’t live near him
why does he need to hide it if its not a shock device?
i wouldn't mind if this motherfucker gets shot in the face the next time he leaves his house....
The thing about a shock collar that you’re not supposed to use it long-term just like place training it’s supposed to be a short term lesson plan for the dog. It’s not supposed to be constantly shocked. It’s supposed to go when commanded verbally you can’t keep using a shock caller on the dog continuously otherwise it’s either gonna get used to it or it’s going to cause a dog to get anxious either way I don’t know why I’m surprised by this guy, the same guy who let a terrorist on his live stream
what's the difference with this to ET-800? Looks the same to me?
I hope he gets deported to India
damn you jews!
Hasan's IQ is amazing
Hasan : But Arnold said you need to shock the muscle
If he'll do this to his dog, imagine what he'll do to a stranger who disagrees with him
0:20 "fuck yeah they for sure saw that"
" A Narcissist will never admit to being wrong. " - oHH the irony of these people....
call ICE on hasan, theres no way he legit
What an absolute clown.
Asmong should buy his dog from him 😅 straight cash 💸 💰
are people dumb ? all these remotes for each of these colors all look similar the 300-pg which is a vibrating one has the same exact controller .
What a GREASEBALL
The thing is, it's not the use of an e-collar training device that is the issue. It's the fact that he is using it to force the dog to stay laying down for hours on end, for no other reason than to rack up "heckin wholesome relatable reddit internet points". Using a pet as a prop set piece, and not a living creature that has needs.
animal cruelty will ruin your streaming career
Hassan might be the dumbest person on the planet
Has anyone ever wondered if the reason why all this is happening is because his dog is jewish?
What else could you expect from a turk?
I genuinely don’t understand how people can defend him anymore.
i dont even know why Hasan is famous with his evil views, western kids are so easy to manipulate it seems
House of glass moment
"omg it's over wtf we're done for f**** goodbye world it's really really over this time"  next post: "omg it's over wtf we're done for f**** goodbye world it's really really over this time"
Hasan is a fuck-up! He always has been and always will be!
Hasan muslim motherfucker
In Germany, he could be reported for animal cruelty.
"No no you don't understand, its just the remote control for my vibrating buttplug, it sometimes sends shocks so strong it zaps anyone in the room"
He is genuinely so stupid it’s actually breaking new grounds it’s genuinely baffling to me
Funny thing is that the button could be lying in plain sight for hours and literally nobody would ever notice, if he wouldn't move his hand to that spot specifically to hide the button. I even think he could draw as much attention to this object and a lot of people would still say like "you really believe he has a button on his desk to zap the dog and it would just be over here under a camera?". Even Asmongold would give it benefit of the doubt.  Sold himself, lmao
It's hilarious how it only gets worse and worse but at the same time pretty sad to see stupid people still defending him despite the situation being as clear as day
He’s rich
Now that there’s a ceasefire shouldn’t he fuck off to Gaza?
Why twitch aprove animal abuse??
Shock collars actually are a good way to train and teach dogs. As long as the setting isn't that high and you use it to train, not to keep your dog in the fucking camera frame
Why is every second video lined with: its over?!   Give us the epstein files FFS
😂 I gotta say The Unity of Clippers to expose Hasan's foolish attempts to make himself look innocent really is commendable
dw guys people still believe him, hasan is an angel god gives guide for the human
Look out Ass-Man his uncle won't know who you are anymore
It was buttplug remote
This is how these pretend communists would treat anyone under them. Wake up all you idiots in Hasan's cult!  He's been lying about literally everything he says since day 1.
As a Turks here is a fun fact for you! His dad is a Right Wing politician in Turkey :D This should say a lot about this guy being a left wing in America.
Animal abuse is part of his culture, where he is from, if one knows about halal meat.
This guy is done he is an liar and hypocrite.
When it comes to animals, people really put 1000% effort in search of evidence.
hassan got mad cuz pokimane's PD didn't post the video of their podcast
this wouldnt have been that big IF HE JUST ADMITED IT. wtf is wrong with this guy. he can never say he is ever wrong.
Is that a christmas tree? Why would hasan the weasel turd have a tree.
Man someone call the swat
I think shock collars play a big roll in early development in certain breeds
It could be the remote for his vibrating buttplug.
Yep him and he fellow douche bags should all get shock collars while we have the remotes.
this is shocking news
Hasan "I hate fascism, unless im part of it" Piker
what a disgusting pos
"It's not happening, and it's good that it is."
He just never learns
He hides it because HE knows it's wrong but ends up being a scared bitch for being shitted on by the internet about his dog abuse while trying to spin the narrative when we aren't fucking idiots. Everything he talks about being against is EXACTLY what he's doing right now.
I love when people EXPOSE, THEMSELVES!! 🙏🏽😂
One would think that, since this piping hot, he would make *EXTRA* sure that nothing is visible...
We need to sue for animal abuse
Can't say I'm shocked, unlike the dog.
100% he going to blame A.i. bro this keep getting better & better
What can a twitch user do to inform twitch that this is happening? Maybe someone is supporting terrorists....maybe they're abusing dogs. But if we see something what can we do?
What a disgusting piece of shit
Has uncle Cenk had anything to say about the torture of puppy dog?
What a POS.
Sickening.
from now on, the only acceptable way to call hasan will be "dog zapper"
he's so fucking retarded I don't get it
His dog his rules
Maybe stop promoting him? You are giving him much needed attention which was the FREAKING POINT OF HAVING THE DOG WITH SHOCK COLLAR DURING STREAMS. Embarrassing!
And yet, his viewers are just like him. Total pieces of sh*t, so, it really won't effect him at all.
And he called us mentally ill and obsessed fells so fucking good to be proved right doesn't it?
Why would a Muslim celebrate Christmas. Ala isn't going to be happy with him.
He is a rnud$lime, makes sense
I mean geez try better if you're gonna lie to the entire internet. This is the last draw lol
Cant believe dude is still alive, if i knew this was happening at someone from around my neighborhood i would make it my fulltime job to make this persons life a living hell
"Uh-oh, it looks like Kaya is misbehaving, let's give her a motivation by administrating a controlled shock." -This bozo
Unreal 😂
well do not collar me shocked. it would have been revealed in due time.
Remember, all of his friends know  There's no way they don't
VIBRATE GATE
All jokes aside here.. this guy is shocking his dog so it can stay still for Live video! Bra is filth
Psychopath behavior. One thing about those people is that they love to taunt others and have everything in plain sight. Just so they can feel like they have the upper hand and feel intellectually superior when confronted and they can claim that YOU are wrong and making things up. But there's always one constant: at the end of the day,they get too emboldened and they slip up,make a mistake,and get caught. Game Over, man! Game Over.
Ah the pirate software strategy genius
Pikerchu caught dead to rights!
"Well well well, if it isn't the consequences of our own actions"
“He never admits he’s wrong, even about little things” He’s unironically a textbook narcissist
Let's see how hassan fans will defend this now. Will they keep blaming right wingers and Isreal?
and twitch wont do shit against this bastard
Valkyrae stood up for this clown 😂
Same spot, same motion, if you still choose to deny it you’re a piece of shit
The thing is that no one who believes him will care and the rest of the world already hates him lol
Well when you're a narcissist... This is how you act. Never take accountability or responsibility for your own actions. Never.
Just don’t be a shit person, and you won’t have f ups like this. Simple. As you’d say lol.
I am shocked, shocked like his dog
When a liar lie once they always lie again. Works everytime.
That poor puppy. Lets put a dog shock collar on Hasan.
He really just slapped some tape on the shock collar just to lie and say he never shocked her for days... and then sells himself out 💀. Its so dumb you would think he's farming but thats giving him way too much credit. Rip bozo
Who cares. It's a great training tool for dogs.
Rescued a four month old Rottie pup that, a year a and a half later, has permanent scarring from large wounds caused by repeated and excessive use of an e-collar. He was the saddest pup I ever laid eyes on. But he saved my life, and I suspect, vice versa.
Its actually very sad. Big youtubers laughing about that. But I am pretty sure his dog is not…..
In all seriousness. Someone should steal that dog from him. Hasan is such a reprehensible piece of shit and it is far *FAR* past time he got some goddamn consequences for all of his evil.
"Corruption is not bad, corruption is bad when I'm not involved" Hasan logic
His anxiety must have been through the roof when he realized the remote was on camera xD
Hassan lies and water is wet.
This guy must be one of the most unlikeable guys ever
It's sooooo over 😂
He is so dumb. I honestly think he must be inbred himself since it would explain his low IQ and his habit of saying that onto others
"I did not have relations with that vibrating object."
It's SO wild to me this is the thing that is dragging his rep down. Not saying it isn't bad, just, out of everything he's said and done... it's like only being upset with an actual nazi because of a parking ticket, rather than the whole WWII thing. 😂
Oh whoops, better move the torture device
I think everyone should call animal control on him and have the dog removed
I also know that Aizen Joe star from bleach  His hair is definitely a stand
Someone ventilate that turd , why is a low iq muslim installing a Christmas tree ??
If Kash Patel spent this much energy on his job, Jeffrey Epstein would be brought to justice.
I can’t believe someone like Valkyrae actually dates a guy like this 😅 and defends someone like this… crazy
Sad part? Twitch will never ban him and his diehard fans will never admit that he shocked his dog and is an animal abuser.
Can we stop laughing about him abusing animals & actually get him to suffer the consequences.
HAHAHAHA
He doesn't deserve to have an animal, fucking ass hole, the dog didn't even do anything wrong, "my mum is letting it roam around kaia is so spoiled" wtf man is wrong with you? It looks like you have a dog just for prop. Why else would it be a problem.. These dogs lay down on the floor because they get warm.. "it's not good for it's bones" it's the first time I've heard anyone tell me the dog gets broken if it lays down on the floor...
They beat there wives in public. Why do you think he would care about a dog. And a girl dog even less.
i wonder if valkyray and pokimane will wake up now? but i think not, otherwise hasan won't fuck them anymore.
What a dumb prick.
It's over
FREE KAYA 🤬
So is animal abuse against Twitch ToS? OFCOM needs to enforce the Online safety act if Twitch doesn’t take action.  Live streaming animal abuse could see Amazon fined 10% of global revenue.
clippers change the topic from hasan on this channel
The fuckers cooked, every single fucking stream he's going to be being watched like a hawk, thank God the internet loves animals and will not let this go.
The downfall of Hasan. Not hate speech or supporting terrorism, but shocking his dog.😂😂😂
Even though asmon is a bum, that was pretty funny.
Death to the black mass
It’s either his prostate vibrator or the shock device, time will tell
You know what we hate more than a liar? A person that lies about not abusing animals
If someone has to use a shock collar to control their dog like. They clearly dont have the ability or understanding how to train a dog and should ever own a dog. If you can't train your dog properly and have to use a shock collar, dont get a dog they are vile. He should put that collar on himself and hit the button.
Cenk loves horses and hasan hates dogs
I feel like this is the thing that will hurt him the most out of all the bullshit he has done in the past. Even the dumbest person understands that hurting your dog and obviously lying about it is bad
Thundaga!
I want him deported so bad.
Are shock collars illegal in the USA?
Volts of Peace
This Hasan - is he muslim?
See? When you stop enforcing socialism the people are just gonna start trading with EACHOTHER again! All this indoctrination we've done is gonna be for nothing!  -stalin or sumn lmao
It is not a shock collar, it uses electric pulse. It feels like those foot messager.  A shock collar uses high power shock. There's also a version that uses vibration instead of using electric pulse
Anyone who thought he didn’t shock his dog is slow imo
1:18 Ah, the old PirateSoftware move, never admitting your wrong EVER!
This guy is such a scumbag, seriously. Think about the kind of person you have to be to engage in animal abuse.
Gotcha bitch !
What the fuck would a muslim socialist need a Christmas tree for?
I see Hasan’s opted to take a page out of Stalin’s playbook. But instead of “Not One Step Back,” Hasan’s adopted the policy of “Not One Lie Acknowledged”
Putting an electric dog collar on your dog is equivalent to putting an electric collar on your children. Unbelievable
Who else is never admiring anything? The master of lying?😅
That's how hassan sees the world If you don't obey him Even for a second He WILL correct it Even by mistake Don't let people like him into power
His pole-washers will jump to defend him.  He could actually be beating up his dog at this point on camera and they'll throw themselves in the way of all evidence to protect Hasan. Not a single good person left in his circle. If they don't openly admonish Hasan for this, they should be accomplices at this point.
His look at the camera is the same look perps look at Chris Hansen when they are busted.
Caught red handed! Why is he setting up a christmas tree in October? What a mad man.
His glazers rn 🧑‍🦯
we all know he full of shit, buy now he proved it
This is fucked
Fun fact: Asmon has over a hundred videos with just the title It's over/It's actually over
Worse than not admitting is the double down lies.
Cancel this dude!
From the river to the sea, Kaya will be free!
Hope the dog bites him one day and he gets rabies and dies alone in a pool of his own piss
while he pays people to set up his christmas tree?  isnt a christmas tree a weird thing for a muslim to have?
Who watches that clown Hasan still???!?! Get a life...
Asmon "who cares about dogs bro"
Find a new topic bruh you fuckin obsessed with this dog getting zapped
Holy shit, I didn't think this was gonna get any worse for Hasan...that's what I get for thinking.
This is the guy that will decide who gets to have food, after the revolution
Fuck this guy
He will never admit a mistake because he is human garbage that's convinced he is both morally and intellectually superior to every one else.
Chill bro its just a frog
Where is PETA in all of this
Lunatic psychopath somehow lost more credibility which he didn't already have to begin with, lmao
In germany we call people like Hassan 'Hurens0hn'
He cant be this dumb right?
wish the dog could put the collar on him.....d**k head this guy is though fr
Every Hasan dickrider who called us schizos for deducing a shock button was on the desk need to apologize to us.
PirateSoftware school of thought. "Socialist Elites are never wrong."
Now we have an the proofs. BAN THIS MAN,GOD DAMNIT !
We all knew he's a piece of shit human being.
Holy shit he’s a moron😂🤣
Twitch can’t keep this up. They have to perma ban him for animal abuse.
Ultimately its about animal abuse, pleae whatever your name is your dog deserves better.
Where is PETA? Don’t want to come down on their leftie mates obviously
It's over and over and over and over again
I wonder what Hasan's excuse is going to be for this.
people are surprised that a pos is a pos. interesting.
I'm not shocked. Are you shocked? I know who's shocked. The dog is
That was deer on a headlights stare XD
The best part is how he glances up at the cameral like the guilty tard that he is. He knew that he fucked himself and had to look square at the camera that he new blew his shitty lie.
It's kind of funny that hasan takes notes from the people that he is so against. He has total control over the majority of the streamers like a donor or something
⚡️🐕
We had a beagle and we got one of those for when we brought him to the huge dog park where he could swim and romp freely. He was a beagle, they tend to run off. We needed to use it once when he was really booking it in the other direction. This guy is a monster.
Shock collars are for training. I can understand that. The training should lead to not having it on. Not your fucking convince.
hes a muslim, what do u expect lol
You are retarded if you didn’t already know.
Can't wait to see how all the streamers backpedal and try to defend this now.
This gay assman has a crush on Hassan...lol 😂
The only one shocked that he does this is the dog.
Bros prolly beating Kaya for exposing him
Peaceful just like Islam....
fuck hassan hes a coward and an animal abuser id whip his sorry ass dictionary definition of a GIANT PUSSY
He probably keeps a piss jug under that desk while not allowing Kaia to move for his 4 hour diatribes
Dogs are filthy and unpure according to Islam, they only used for property protections & hunting, and they should live ONLY outside of the house and away from a faithful clean Muslim  That's what Mohamed ordered his followers to do with dogs.
Fuck that hasan
Hopefully after so many shocks Kaya will be able to tap into the speed force and escape Hasan Piker’s tyrannical grip. 😢
Literally the exact remote for the shock collar lol Bro is cooked
BAN BAN BAN HASAN BAN BAN BAN
Can trump send ICE to deport Hasan.
Yeah, any deniability is gone at this point. The lies are insane.
It's AI, Hasan swears...
And yet twitch will continue to ignore it but ban someone with 30 subs because her nipple was visible through her top
I'm not the most intelligent person, but there are lots of people so dumb and retarded...
Ladies & gentlemen …we got him!😂
So tired of these dishonest radicals trying to convince people theyre saints. Hassan is a roach, and not the good kind. These kinds of people infest every space and try to convert people of those spaces to their cause. Theyre roaches.
I dont think its illegal to use a shock collar.  That isn't to excuse this behavior.  It takes a certain kind of douchebag to use one of these things when a simple bags of treats and a little bit of effort would do the trick.
Achtualy its the button for the vibrator that's up his Fans asses🤓
Should have bought a Donkey. He and his Uncle could have Had so much fun with it.
Kaya: *Breathes and move air molecue by 0.00000000000000000001 nano metres*  Hasan: Let’s motivate Kaya to be still with the controlled shock
Bruh who even is this? First time seeing this guy but he’s everywhere right now
Wicked brought destruction upon themselves....
Free Kaya!
Hasan's issue is pride, that's his spiritual diagnosis.
Shock collars are not cruel or painful at all when used properly.  When set properly they are nothing more than a gentle tingle to get your dog's attention.  They are an invaluable training tool for anybody serious about dog training.    I use one for my dog.  He's never yelped in pain.  I can put his collar on my neck and hold the button down and "shock" myself without discomfort.  And human skin is much thinner and more sensitive than the skin on a dog's neck.   That being said, hasan is not using the collar correctly.  He has it set way too high and is not using it appropriately at all.  1. Shock collars are a tool, not a permanent collar.  They shouldn't be used more than 2 or 3 hours a day.   2. When set properly, the shock is not painful at all.  It is a gentle tingle.   3. The shock collar is not supposed to be used as a punishment.  It is used just to get the dog's attention when it is ignoring commands and focused on something else.   4. Anybody serious about dog training, especially for working or hunting dogs that engage in off leash activities where the dog must obey 100% of the time for their own safety, uses shock collars.  When the coyotes show up, or the dog is running towards traffic, you need to be able to call them back 100% of the time.  A shock collar is the best way to train that.    5. You should really do some research and learn about things before you go off half cocked.  Implying that shock collars are cruel, even though you know absolutely nothing about them is just dumb, and only serves to demonize good people who use them the right way.
Who in their right mind watches this goober
He clearly knew he was doing something wrong, that's why he was trying to hide it.
Watch his revolutionaries meatgrinders defend him once more.  The usefull idiots need to polish his saviour image from the obvious slander.
Shock collars are great for barking mutts lol nothing wrong with them 😂
He is an Animal abuser, plan and simple!
Not admitting any fault is a HUGE RED FLAG. It’s a core tenant of Narcissism.
This type of shit is common and normal, people only give af cuz he has some sort of fame online.
I am actually impressed at the level of stupidity....HOW CAN HE LEAVE THE REMOTE THERE.............LIKE WHAT??!?!?!... The lack of IQ is crazy...
can someone count how many times there was over in the title lol
Just take it off and apologise and blame it on a dog trainer ffs
Petition for a new home for Luna. That great dog ❤
holy shit dude it amazes me that he keeps topping himself on being the biggest retard ever
This is like that scene from Austin Powers where he keeps trying to deny that he owns the penis enlarger, but the guy keeps presenting more evidence.
Shouldn't peta raid his house or something
is he actually retarded? is his chat as retarded as he is?
Communists are pathological liars
I knew he was guilty.
I hope his dog eats him in his sleep
It's obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that Hasan is a psychopath. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
Hasan should sue that company for make the people complain about their educator product
Can't wait to heat the duck riders cover up this one with genocide
🎬
Hasan's 50 IQ fans: IT'S AI VIDEO! IT'S LITERALLY AI BRO.
yeah he's done fucked up now
😂😂
What an absolute guilty piece of shit.
be cool AF if the dog attacked and killed him on stream
Dudes a loser. The more he denies the further he digs.
Well done people of the internet. Well done👏🎬
Man it feels so good to be validated. I feel like Doakes but he wins. HASAN IS THE LA SHOCKER WE GOT HIM BOYS!!!
Wow, can you believe he’s so narcissistic he won’t admit fault in any form or manner? And make things up to be right? I’m so surprised, sooooo taken a back
Who cares
More Pegasus, time to react to this masterpiece!
Hasan fans will claim the clip is out of context.. also theres a jenosite going on somewhere in the world!
Oh wow, a communist/socialist lies. Never happened before
psychopathy sounds kinda similar to the behaviour he is showing again and again.
Blessed are the archivist bros who kept the old vods and found this. Let's hope that this is finally enough for CA law enforcement to act. Animal abusers like Hamas Piker are evil and should be punished so that they don't move on to torturing humans. Surest sign of a serial killer that there is...
Only fools that trust Muslims were shocked by this. Learn some history people. Being human doesn't mean that you're a good human. Muslims are awful humans. That's why Western Civilization has been fighting them for over a thousand years.
No way of denying now. Ha ha hahahahaha
Jeeze…What dumb stupid lie is this four-eyed turd going to say this time? “It’s a controller to give Kyah good vibes?”
When i troll hasan's channel with animal abuser, people literally defend him. Ultra ultron cognitive disonance.
Shocking twist 🙀
I would love to give this MF a knuckle sandwich.
BOOM indeed
If a guys willing to lie about this, something so small and stupid to save his image.. what else is he willing to lie about?
I'm so curious to see how his Twitter warriors will defend this now. Betting on a 10k liked tweet saying that shocking your dog is actually good.
IS THAT BACON?!?!?!
I LOVE it.
Did you guys know that Hasan's dog worked at Blizzard for 7 years?
Caught in 4K again.
Hasan being a psychopath that hurts animals? No one saw that coming.
Next episode he’s gonna admit he did it and start explaining his backstory while jazz music from Detective Conan plays in the background
And it's so funny all the people defending him saying it wasn't a shock collar. He just blindly defend this child of a man
Dude just keep digging that hole deeper and deeper
i hate hassan
Hes a propagandist for a reason. His whole life is lying
“Guys he was just going for a zyn. That’s the only reason he reached to that spot” says every hasan fan
0:20 I'm getting crazy DSP energy from the way he looks at the camera. If you know, you know.      "It's been on the whole time"
Fuck it I’m not gonna be depressed for the rest of the night, this is that good 😂
Asmond needs to release how much money he’s made off of all these DogZapping videos once it’s all over with.   Please bro, release the financials to show hAssan how much you’ve made off his abuse  It would absolutely melt the play dough that is where hAssan’s brain should be
A good boy sits and stays
On an unrelated note, why does a woke turkish communist set up patriarchal conservative capitalist Christmas decorations?
The gift that keeps on giving😂😂😂
At least when I use them the girl consents.
The goal of this "training" amounts to the surgical removal of the dog's playful essence, to turn the dog into a toy. When he's not using it it, it sits on a shelf, completely inert like it doesn't exist. Psychopath behavior.
Are Friends Electric?
ironic he's got sparking texts for messages
There u go, a libtard
I cant believe you all pin pointed exactly which collar it was! ROFL good job everyone
Far right acting like Hasan did a Kristi Noem to his dog while defending her paints an amazing picture on how they don't really care about animal cruelty or abuse 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
He wasn’t just using a shock collar on his dog, he was using it to keep his dog on camera as a background prop. That’s the issue.
I mean... yeah that pretty much proves it.
LMFAO
im confused whats the issue the mf has 1000s sold with high reviews on multiple pet websites LMAO why are we acting like its death row?
Its not over till dude gets charged with a crime and put behind bars.
You can’t make this sht up 😂
I'm actually getting upset when I imagine that this dog is constantly getting electrocuted for not acting like a static prop. This is insane
guys its a prop placed by israel don't believe the lies there's a genocide going on in gaza
Call me wierd but im not schocked at all.      Poor Kaya was 🤥😪
maybe pirate software aint so bad after all... nah
If the shock collar isn't so bad why don't he wears it while Kaya gets the remote with treats attached to it.
The charade is over.
I dont get it Is just a shock collar.
Guys, all of you just don’t understand. There are genocides happening out there in the world so this is 100 percent okay.
Imagine if this guy had power over his political opponents... sheesh
The funniest thing is, if he admitted he uses a shock collar to train the dog, this would have been over in like.. less than a week lol and people would have forgotten about it, The issue is he kept trying to hide it and play the "perfect" dude. which he isn't.
He has something that vibrates but it isn't a collar
Anyone with even the slightest bit of common sense has long since stopped needing further proof. Even a moron should understand this, but it's likely still unclear to Husan's audience.
Is the jews, they place it there.
Weasleyest littlest head habitual liar
This feels like a psy op at this point.
💡 Remember Anwar Nasser Abdulla al-Awlaki he was an American Citizen cleric and lecturer. He was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in 1971, while his father, a Fulbright scholar, was attending university in the US. In 2011 Al-Awlaki was ASSASSINATED in Yemen by a U.S. drone 💥strike ordered by President Barack Obama. Al-Awlaki was the 1st U.S. CITIZEN to be TARGETED & ASSASSINATED by a U.S. government drone 💥strike ORDERED BY A US PRESIDENT. Maybe President Trump can 💥Hasan Doğan Pikereven🤔 or 💥Frogan "Doğan Piker"🤣⁉💯%FAFO‼ Hasan needs to go on vacation to the middle east somewhere & take Frogan with him.😂😂😂 🚨Remember in 2011 Obama "SET THE PRECEDENT" & Establish the standard, rule, or example of how to act or how a situation should be handled in the future, which other US Presidents are now likely to follow in legal contexts, where a decision by a 2011 US President becomes binding authority for subsequent actions, or in broader social, political, and personal situations, influencing US customs and traditions.😉✌ I'm out‼
I mean the memes have been fucking amazing but this guy's a genuine psychopathic animal abuser, Id put money on it not just stopping at animals either, he'd have a collar on his girlfriend if he was allowed to
needs to lose the ability to own animals, he just keeps it cooped up with invisible cages called shock collars
So he still had the shocker there...meaning he still has every intention of shocking his dog again lol. Watch hassans fans start to say that the dog deserved it.
terrible, just terrible. dominates his dog and zapps him, how can this guy be about peace when he shocks other living beings.
What do you say? A prolific leftist influencer turns out to be a psychopathic, narcissistic abuser and pathological liar? Color me shocked!
Forceful coercion is what all Commies quickly resort to.
Hassan always looks so guilty to me, like constantly. His eyes, his facial muscles, it always hides his real thoughts. He is not a real person, everything he is is fake. He knows he's guilty of alot more things
Regardless of if the dog was shocked, MoistCritikal put it best in his video, the entire point of Place training is to have a designated place the dog feels comfortable and safe in that is theirs to own, it's not to restrict them to a small square and become aggressive when they step out of it. Regardless of if he shocked the dog or not, his anger and frustration over the dog barely moving was over the top and indicative of a larger behavioral problem on Hasan's part.
Typical Low IQ
At this point Twitch is just setting themselves up with tons of future evidence of inconsistent tos enforcement. If/when some streamers decides to sue.
1:29 it’s very telling lol if he is willing to lie about details when he’s caught red handed and even smaller things bro is lying all the time
Someone needs an SDR monitoring Hasan's house.
PIRATE SOFTWARE is the equivalent character for HAMAS PIKER
Scum fck lair, to be expected from leftist
Dogs are haram in islam. That's why he is doing that. He doesn't care about his dog. That dog is only for views.
Even delusional people would say it's a shock collar at this point.
Obviously a Mossad agent planted that there to make Hassan look baf. This guy is the intellectual voice for leftists. He is their most moral. Most intelligent, most wonderful representation they got.
Cooked
Thought he was an asshole before, but he managed to be even worse than that, scum, thrash, lowlife are tame adjectives for him...
He deserves to be taken down. No place for animal cruelty online people. Animals deserve this planet way more than us.
The funniest thing about this whole situation is that it literally has changed nothing with Hasan
Hasan's dog was shocked after watching this video 😂
WOW! 🤣🤣🤣 This is probably more than what the FBI or CIA could ever do.
Is this legal? I hope not.
Oh man the dog got so educated for sure
Typical muslim
Hasan is an absolute steaming pile of shit!
HE GONE COOKED FOLKS!!!!
Communists aren't people
Supporting geno cider is ok but shocking a dog is over the line? We're rotten to the core as a civilization..
nothing wrong with using a shock collar just don't lie about using it
XD
Guys that's not a shock collar remote. That's his personal vibrator remote 😂🤨
I'm not against shock collars in certain situations but him obviously lying about it and not clearly showing the "vibrating collar" he was supposedly using is just weird. That dog doesn't seem vicious or anything either so I don't think a shock collar is necessary. I'm in no way a professional dog trainer obviously. This hanz guy or whatever his name is just seems like a douche anyways from the little I've watched of him. I hope he gets his.
nothing will ever happen to him.
The fact that he know he need to hide it make it 100 × worse
Hasan genuinelly cannot get any fucking dumber holy fuck, like just fucking admit he zeus one taps his dog and he wouldn't be such a meme.
Rich coming from the guy that called Palestinians inhumane
Mr. Gorbachev shock that dog again!!!
Shoutout to the person that was able to get the name of the device. I've seen a handful of clips and wish this dog had a new home.
He's just digging his own grave even deeper
Hasan’s a piece of shit and his followers are low IQ sub human wasters tbh.
now the question is: *when will he be arrested for animal abuse?*  Why are leftists so far above the law like this?
He’s sooooo stupid
Guy thinks he's a smooth criminal so casually sliding the ET-300 is a "Mini Educator" out of frame LOL.
Let’s get that prick one and leave it on permanently 😡
**Looks up** "Oh 🫠"
If anyone asks what a narcsissist is, just link them Hasans channel.
If this is not Fake just realy think about it and what Type of a Human you have to be .. I would never think about buying a Torture Tool like this just for Fun who comes up with Shit like that only someone whos Mentally Ill no?
How is this going to end up being the fault of the jews?
bro cant even use palestine as a cop out no more his favourite president saved Palestine
He's Thor's besttie, lolcows unite.
Why are they putting up a Christmas tree in October ?
"Ok no one noticed, no one noticed..." *Proceeds to stare at the camera looking guilty af*
It's his dog he can do what he wants it's not like he's killing the dog
His followers literally don't give a flying fuck about any of this. And the mainstream media promoting him as well.
And people still defend him , so nothing will change 🤏🏻
How does someone so unlikable as Hasan have a fanbase???
Disgusting weirdo psychopath
Even if Kaya gets taken to a good home where she is truly loved and cared for and free....she is still going to have lifelong trauma because of this @$$hole..💔  It really breaks my heart. Dogs are supposed to roam around and play. You can train dogs to behave without using physical pain like a shock collar, or use any suffering such as breathing restrictions with the collar being so tight, not being able to eat or drink water until their owner allows them to, demanding they stay in the same spot and position for hours on end, etc.   Hasan 1000% views pets and dogs as slaves to control. That they were put here to be the slaves of human beings. You can see where he said this on stream in the clip on youtube.   In no world is it okay or morally right to use physical pain like electricity to "train and control your dog." What it really is, is an excuse to mentally and physically abuse the dog just a tiny bit, so that you can have that total control and power over another living beings life and choices they make.   Its about control.   Kaya has always been used as a prop for his stream since the day he got her. That poor dog..💔
Jesus fucking christ, he's so fucking dumb it's impressive.  He really is the Cartman of the Tankies
i don't like hassan, but there are collars like that that only vibrate and beep
Are we surprised? Poor dog :(
Why has nobody reported this POS to authorities?
how does this keep getting worse and worse lol.
I am wondering how in fucks name the police hasn't been involved already.
I thought it was just a silly joke, can’t believe the shock collar is actually real
Who would have thought the self described socialist with more money than most people in the world is a hypocrite?
Of all the things to take down this bozo I never figured it would be animal cruelty
someone strap that thing to HIS ASS and let him feel it even on the lowest setting IT FUCKING HURTS
These uploads are top tier 😂💯💯💯
I'm no doctor however, I am as sure that he has some sort of ASPD as I am that he shocked that dog.
Oversized manchild muppet
Busted. I'm not surprised.
HEHAAA HES COOKED
This dude knows he’s immune to cancellation. The audacity to still have the remote next to him😂😂😂
Wow
"Just like Trump" The left just never ever learns...
Surely this time it's the Yeti on the camera.
I hope the dog gets the collar off bites him in the balls gets out of the house and finds a better family 👍
"it's actually over"? We need Morepegasus asap!
Like Trump
he is a effing woman in a man's body good luck getting him to admit anything
He's so fcking pathetic, dude... like... just coming out and saying we do electroshock training would have been WAY less of a big deal. Nah... had to lie about it. Most insecure dude on the internet, and it's not even close.
I think he's taking the trophy from Piratesoftware.
Hasan has the mind, maturity, personality, ethics, head size, and philosophy of an 11 year old.
Hasan was so busy trying to fabricate defamatory stories about other people and advocate for the deaths of innocent people that he forgot to hide the evidence of his own animal abuse.  I hope he gets what's coming to him, because I'm tired of seeing the system profiteering off of people like Hasan and keeping them platformed in spite of more ToS violations than Epstein had clients.
Asmon is so fair to him.
He must have terrorist genes holding a remote detonator if his demands are met 100% of the time 🤷‍♂️. The dog is like, "My leg is going numb, think I'll turn around" and Hassan grabs his detonator and loud speaker, in his best Bane voice goes, " I am Kaya's reckoning. I am here to fulfill Raja Ghoul's destiny."
Not a surprised behaviour coming from a terrorists supporter.
Don't understand the myriad of videos, it was clear the first time. End him.
F-ing hilarious 😂🤣 that photo of Hasan-mas looking up needs to be a meme! 🤭 MAKE IT HAPPEN! 🫶🏽
Lying sack of shit. Hasan Diddy Stalin Piker.
Everyone acting surprised this guys a scumbag ....
Hoping this dude just ends it for himself. Fucking guy serves no purpose.
Hold valk and so on accountable to.
It's actually over for Hasan. But is it reaaaally over for him???
You judge a society by how it treats its weakest members.
no et300, it got no shock function
I fucking hate that only laughs about it dosnt condomn it, jutt laughs. What a piece of shit
This guy is a pos demon
Meet canyon video incoming
It's getting to be so much FUN watching all "you" chattle fall, one by one...
How does it get worse every day 😂
The dog is only safe when other people are around thats insane.
What a dumbass.
Idk why the tail yanking from 6 years ago on his old dog isn’t bigger than it is
not what i’d like to see him destroyed for but i’ll take it
Ok ok I was being as charitable as possible before I tried to give him every out just because I didn't want to believe someone would do that to their dog for standing up but can't anymore someone take this dog away from this man
The amount of brain cells you have to lack to have a f up this bad is astonishing.
I really cant stand Hasan. Hes a bundle of sticks.
I think yall just want to have sex with each other. It’s okay
Got ‘em
It's like when people stealing in grocery stores and they look at all the cameras and try to not act strange lmfao
I'm kinda sick of seeing this gay-ass drama all the time
Kaya will singlehandedly get Hasan perma banned, finally. Or maybe not because its America, democrats and terrorist get a freebie.
I saw a post from someone on another video somewhere, basically the vibration collars only work stand alone after in conjunction with a shock collar initially. The dog gets a vibration followed by a shock, and eventually learns that the vibration is "bad".
This guy is so retard.
Now the kiddos fans from Hasan what they gonna do??
Any streamer who defended him should be cancelled as well because if they lie for this, they would lie for anything.
"Occam's razor" The simplest explanation is usually the right answer.
Operation rescue kaya, send all the agency available. Send the Delta force or seal6 to it ✌✌.
Please don't do the same with the rats in your house. KEKW
So Hasan is lyinggggggggggg??????? what a shockerrrrrrrrrrrrr, he always the bastion of TRUUUUUUUFFFF
It's alright guys Kaya is an electric type, it's actually good for her - Hasan probably sometime in the near future
Its over lmao hahahha all his simps went to bat for him
How is this really really bad animal abuser still allowed to streaming....should be arrested and his dog rescued! I don't think his god appreciates the Christmas tree!
I guess the wide view really shocked him.
we got em
Why's he support a Christian holiday? A little to close to oppression is it not?
Caught on 4K
guys it's his personal vibrator
Like bro just admit it. My parents use shock collars on our dogs cus we keep them outside without a fence so its to prevent them from going too far, however we don't shock them for no reason.
buen video crack
That's one unusual looking mouse Hasan 🖱
Dont f_ck with dogs.
We still got a hostage being held by Hamas Piker
It's like the last days of the Ellen show.
Never trust a guy that wears Chris Christie's pants.
He is Evil
I understand this is proof but how was it ever a debate to begin with.
It’s happened, it is over and happened it’s over happened happen happens over overly over
He is such a terrible person. SOMEHOW IT TOOK SHOCKING HIS DOG FOR EVERYONE TO GO CRAZY. But supportign Terorrists and wanting to kill Jews, nah that wasn't vontroverse enough for the internet.
So if he is shocking the dog can they finally take it away?
I hope they will find a safe comfy home for the dog somewhere after they put that animal into jail.
hasan is electric element of twitch lmao... electro wizard of internet
You can trust Hassan to be fucking dumb enough to actually show the remote when tons of ppl scour his vods for 1 sec of detail to prove he is lying scumbag that never gets what he deserves... Still cant wait for him to call it actually not HIS FAULT that he shocks dogs and call it training...
I never knew who this guy was before this But the way he talks about his dog, like he needs to shock it to "train it" to stay in a corner for 10 hours is a sign of his controlling personality. He has no empathy. In the right environment he'd be in the news for keeping girls in a basement
Just get ASPCA out there already at this point. The Animal Cruelty cannot be any clearer.
Shocking a dog is terrible but deporting and disappearing citizens is worse. Think about it since youre so smart and unbiased 😂
What about the clips where he pulls his dogs tail dragging them backwards
Uhh so we all agree Hassan’s a pathetic lying asshole now?
Please somebody take this motherfucker down.
Pokimane in Shambles.... Her employees, unemployed.
At this point, anyone defending him is mentally restarted
The problem is, Hassan thinks his entire audience is stupid… and he’s 100% correct.
You frikng Ashole. Hasan is innocent. That's not a remote for a shock collar. That's just a remote for a vibrator in his as.
You understand that if Hasan got ban you go with him?
This wouldn't be this bad if he would just say what it was the first time. The lies and deflections made it 10 times worse.
Ok now let loose the dogs of war 😂
These should be on lib women only this is so wrong bro......
He's just such a pussy lol
Only pu$$ies use shock collars who are lazy dog owners especially on non hyper aggressive dogs. Give your dog away please.
i think at this point he's just testing what he can get away with, a sorta messed up challenge for himself
A true narcissist serial killer villain vibe he has.
What a shocking development to this story.
"Boom."
Guys, its the shock collar of tolerance and empathy!
I hope the internet never lets him live this down his friends with make excuses as always
Clearly reaching for Zyns
To be honest it looks like the X-IG-88 butt plug remote.
Dude literally moved it out of frame and looked up like a 5 year old hoping he didn't get caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Anyone who has no problem inflicting pain on an animal is a sociopath.
Now that it’s really definitive I’m starting to feel worried for Kaya…. I really hope he doesn’t take anger out on the dog. Genuinely going to add Kaya into my prayers tonight.
cant we just make something to save that poor dog? maybe an animal care institution or sue him for Animal abuse?
Well if it isn't Hasan The Abuser Piker
Boom!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s like watching a slow motion train wreck
Uh oh
I mean, there are better ways to train a dog than to shock them, and Kaya appears to be pretty docile.
How do people still like this retard. - obviously talking about Hasan
Turn yourself in, Piker.
Like how even the text on the vid has electric effects
The more you try to hide something more attention you bring to it
insane... how psycho he is
Whatttttt, one of the biggest "influencers" to be a hardcore "anti-fascist", is caught red handed using whats essentially the equivalent to the most fascist control policy you could have? Shocking/inflicting pain on a "lower" creature to keep it in line. Who could've ever seen that one coming.
hasan secretly supporting tesla
He probably was thinking that it could be seen through the other camera pov and moved it before anyone could notice...but we already did and his looks already realized it.
he lying about this. what else he lyin about. or better yet. is he even saying anything true
someone shot him in his neck already
100% confirmed, Hasan is a POS.
God you people are so disgusting. Hasan has done nothing wrong and yet you can't let it go. Asmongold has become even more unhinged since dad died. He needs help
The dog deserved it
So he lies about this what’s not to say he lies about not being a pdf file. He sure accuses people of that extremely often. 😂😂😂
That's the remote for his b-plug. Chill guys.
This fool reqlly got minions setting up a christmas tree in fooking october😅😅😅
Always bet on Electric Types
He’s a psychopath he has to lie everything he says is a lie it’s how he lives his life. 😂
Hasan will do the most deranged shii and his unemployed minus iq fans will still defend him. I feel sorry for the parents.
You’re just not gonna talk about the corruption in the government? Or maybe your editor is just making a narrative.
Where do we draw the line??? There has to be someone or group of people that can stop him.
A Narcissist will never admit to being wrong.
Pathological liars can't help but to lie about everything and blame other, they are physically unable to be honest
PETA should protest outside of his house for animal cruelty
The power of autism
he's such a piece of shit. It's like he's a gearbox villain.
Fascist fuck calls for people to be murdered, nothing happens, openly supports KNOWN terrorists, nothing happens, takes part in violent riots, nothing happens, celebrates assassinations, nothing hating... does this and you all get more offended then all the other bs this sack of shit does daily... wtf lmao
Next vid, Hasan gonna explain why shocking the dog is a good thing
Anyone remember when Alinity gave her cat Milo vodka or threw her cat or sat down on her cat and everyone on the internet came together against her? She was not found to be abusing animals by the SPCA. Only a matter of time before animal protection authorities do an investigation, but something about Hasan and his way of defending himself tells me he wont get off as easy as Alinity.
I actually didn't believe at first but now...
Shock collars should never be a thing. If you can't train your goddamn dog then dont get a dog. It astounds me how many people there are justfying its usage. Just train your damn dogs, if you actually have the will to do it the dog will heed your every word. Using a collar is a crutch cause your dumbass cant handle a dog.
It’s actually over holy shit….
What a piece of shit.
Poor dog 😔 I hope someone takes care of the Hasan problem and rescues that dog! 🐶
Cancel this guy
liars ALWAYS get found out. nothing will happen to him but at least hes proven to be a liar to those that care about morals
Pro Palestinian and leftist to the core
loooooock him uuuuuuup duuuuuude
fuck this guy
Hassan telling lies?? no way man he has the biggest integrity
The obvious thing here is HE KNOWS ITS BAD. But he acts as if its normal. disgusting human
Fool keeps on digging his own grave
He’s a POS animal abuser. They need to rescue that poor dog.🤬
CNN: "HASAN SHOCKS HIS DOG WITH ELECTRICITY AND HERE'S WHY ITS A GOOD THING."
Except it doesnt matter at all. If the far right will support pedophiles you think the far left gives a shit about a shock collar?
Hilarious. His little coven of witches will still defend him. They just wont upload the podcast they just did with him 😂
Nothing to see here
Ladies and Gentlemen.... we got him
Next video title : "No it really is over this time"
why do people watch this loser. stop giving this asshat views, money and attention.
Bro who cares it’s his dog
The slow 👁👁 up at the camera
The guy lies so much you'd think he'd be better at it, but I guess when morons will defend him no matter what, he doesn't see a need to.
Hasan face is the same of each of those faces that heard "why don't you take a seat right over there"
A grifters gotta grift.
I don't care what he says. I don't care about his political stances. He can say dumb s*** all he wants.  , I care that he's an animal abuser. And for that reason, I hope he can never safely go out in public again
I bet he jacks off dry. Pervert.
Don't forget the clip where an actual dog lover was with him and said the collar was too tight. Need to fit 2 fingers. Don't remember his actual 25 IQ excuse but it was something along the lines of "she's got thick skin". Pure POS human trash this guy.
If PETA won’t gett on his ass even after this, we’ll clearly know why
Such a scared little thing he is, just a pathetic garbage
Yep I want you to beat his ass
"He never admits that he's wrong" Reminds me of the guy who worked 7 years at Blizzard.
I am not shocked (no pun intended) that Hasan is a compulsive liar. I've always said that guy gives me sociopath vibes. I am more shocked that there are people out there who still buy into his bs.
It’s still Israel’s fault
That collar is so tight I don't know how that dog isn't uncomfortable all the time.
Piker is a terrorist
It evolved to Kayachu! It's now weak to ground and grass which it can never touch on hASHan's watch.
So its 100% proven he shocks a dog and forced it to stay in a single place for hours (when shock is used for extreme purposes only in dog training) then he proceeds to lie about it and made it political. I think not only he is a bad person but might have some mental issues.
We know Hasan. Just try and lie we’ll pick u apart
means that piece of shit stills doing the shocks, knowing he is on the red point. what an absolute idiot.
I don't know why people need so much evidence when it's obvious that he shocked the poor dog on the clip.
Hassa is such a gold plated nepo-baby millionaire wanna be communist PoS.
I can't wait for the next MorePegasus
I had these guys spamming me "he said it isn't a shock collar" every time i mentioned it. Like yeah bitch. It's called lying.
I'm sorry He's a piece of shit commie
Aaaaaaand still nothing will come of this. Twitch won't ban him and he'll keep using it on poor Kaya because no authority will take the dog away.
If it is real it is concerning for all his political values also. It says something about how he wants to assert power. Also it says a lot about his non existent level of empathy.
That dog needs to be taken away from that abuser
Where are the people saying it was a vibrator collar only?. WHERE ARE THEY?. SHOW YOUR FACE YOU SHAMELESS POS!!
If it is real it is concerning for all his political values also. It says something about how he wants to assert power. Also it says a lot about his non existent level of empathy.
That look up at the cam says it all.. it's like he's not wearing a seatbelt and starring at the passing police officer to see if he's being seen, only drawing more attention to himself..
This type of person doesn't believe in the possibility of being incorrect. That's why he cant admit it. His worldview doesn't allow room to be wrong or grow.
In 8K
Well, lets hear hes defence this time, maybe he'll say something new. Probably not, but lets give Hasan a benefit of the doubth
No it's not over because we know that Twitch will do fucking nothing about it as always.
continuous mode
BRING DOWN ALL MARXISTS, ARISE FREE PEOPLES
This is planned. I don't give him credit, but I can't give him negative credit either. You'd think - after the controversy and all the eyes on him trying to debunk or prove things... that he wouldn't just remove the remote from the room? You think he wouldn't just change out collars entirely being a multi millionaire? You think he didn't check each camera feed and ensure the focus is correct, coloring is correct, lighting is correct, and didn't *ONCE* check to see if the remote is in view?... Like... He is clever enough to create the most cult-like following I ever seen. Clever enough to twist any narrative, succeed in keeping an audience debating an assassinated figure, succeed in keeping the audience after terroristic threats, succeeded in doing many verbal-illegal things in the United States and stays untouched ... you're telling me he just f's up over a remote on a table?...  It's going to be a planned redemption ark. He'll go "Look, I'm sorry for lying - I'm going to be the better man", then proceed to show the dog love (that any normal owner would) and they'll (the cult) go "he's such a changed man!" and completely ignore the words they previously said, completely forget the claims they so boldly claimed, and ignore the past to only focus on the present.  I'm only stating this cause like... there's no way that's not intentional. Good play Hasan... but to what end? You're not really painting yourself a pretty picture. Also the remote is faced down - and I don't know about you, but who the hell puts a remote control (of any kind) faced down? Not stating the face pointed at the table is the "front", but the antenna which should be pointed "up" when held, is pointed *towards* him? That's like putting your gun down on a table but the barrel is facing at you. You never do that, you always have it where, when it's picked up, it's perfectly easy for you to grab with your hands. In that position, the remote isn't grabbable easily and requires turning the remote before using it (Unless he intentionally left it like that so the remote is pointed *towards* the dog as if, in an encased room, that's necessary for a collar worth $100+ ... he could think that matters).
>she hit her dew claw >its a vibration collar You are here >its a shock collar but i removed the prongs so it only vibrates  >its a shock collar >she's a bad dog  >i shock my dog for no reason >other abuse scandles
now how will his girls defend him this time
… bro … hasan is literally liberal temperature iq …
Dude this is it busted that fool
Nobody is shocked about this... except for the dog
He's such a pathetic little boy cosplaying as a Chad. Too bad his audience is so brainwashed
Another W for the internet! I'm so proud of you guys😁
He's going to say that it's because his home keys were there, and someone could copy them and break into his house. Has clearly nothing to do with the big remote that has a button called "Zap the dawg" on it ;) Trash person. Nuff said.
Why he hiding that Orb of Lightning??
​@Valkyrae 😂 aBoUt aLl tHe gEnOcIDe 😩
I couldn't be more proud of myself for not having any clue what this is all about...
I completely believe  that hasan has shocked is dog on stream, but i think he show the remote on purpose now.
What an evil person
Why do we care about the animal abuse there's a genocide going on 💀
I actually can't believe he would just leave it there after he already got so much heat lmao
This dude does not in ANY way deserve a dog. Get this poor thing out of there! 🫵🏻
Super smart guy NGL 🤣 he wants the drama and the views to keep going
Asmon is still a shitty person I hope he remembers that. Looks and is hideous
you can also see the prop dogs that he wanted his dog to act as.
Pathetic scumbag. Rants about control and all that, but when it's him doing it, he gives himself a free pass. The epitome of hypocrisy.
In 4k
It's still funny how this is what does it for people, not everything else Hasan has said and done.  But regardless of that, at least people are calling him out on it rather than just sweeping it under the rug like usual.  Can't wait for CDawgVA to work with Hasan and proceed to insult his viewers for being concerned
Dang, Pegasus is gonna take his series to the 1000th episode now.
He is middle eastern they hate dogs and treat them like shit even their religion hates them seriously f this guy and the rest of them as well
Who even are these people and how did I end up here
It's ok Hasan  *We see you.*
It took a shock collar for more people to say "hold up, this guy might not be a good person" 😭😭😭😭
Certified Moron.
GET THIS GUY
If half of the internet sleuths that investigated Hasan's dog concentrated on JFK's unaliving we would know who did it by tomorrow.
Collar me shocked that the man who justifies using violence and terrorism against his opponents also abuses his dog.
It is a training collar haha are you being that dumb on this one bro>?
GGWP
He would be a woman beater.
Charlie's immortal, Hasan's now hiding shock collars. What a time to be alive.
WHERE IS THE BAN TWITCH.
His "Oh the camera's on! the camera's been on the whole time huh? Didnt even know.." moment
Got 'im.
We had a shock collar for my dog. But it wasn’t a like electricity shock collar. It just creates a high pitched sound that only dogs can hear that alerts the dog and scares her a bit to fall back in order. We didn’t shock her if she gets out of frame or some stupid shit like that. We only gave her one shock if she like barked non stop for 3 minutes or something like that to get her to stop. We only used it when we needed to, and it made her a better dog. Hasans shit though is disgusting. his dog didn’t do anything and he shocked her, uncool.
The inability to admit wrong is a consequence of being sheltered, combined with wealth.
He is just a political Mossad/CIA politically paid plant. That hassan has to be rage baiting people...his paycheck depends on it. So many of these leftist are just undercover social infiltrators. These people stir false controversy and fake or really rage people to discredit lots of people or groups...how come he hasn't been booted or kicked out of his platform for obvious reasons or crap...you see the point or the picture...he is a social engineer.
but what about  the genocide tho
"Educator"? These sales people have no chill.
i don't know why but this got me thinking he would defend himself by saying something like= well, the product is correctly advertised."
Well... Collar me Shock!!!?!!
How is this funny?
Why isn’t he allowed to shock his dog? I’m lost
Can you please make one video with every single clip, I feel like so many have come out lol
Hassan has been a wierdo for a while, darkviperau was right all along huh?
Why the fuck is he setting up for Christmas? it's not even halloween yet dumba
And we thought the North Koreans were bad to dogs...
we got him lmao
This is bigger than Epstein.
What an actual retard
God he is a duck tard!
The funny thing about stupid people is they think that everyone else is dumber than them
I guess twitch is ok with animal abusers
EASY MATH. JD Vance run for Pres. Trump as his VP
hes got that democrat brain:  pretend it didnt happen  claim something else actually happened  claim it did happen but its not a big deal  claim it did happen and it's actually a good thing.
naw people will follow that puppet cause humans are terrible people. people gonna become pro dog shocking just to vindicate.
Brzzzt bad dog :( that poor dog .... chows are hard enough by temperament  but to torture it and inevitably abandon it in a shelter  is just sad, do better Hasan
1:20 dude HE'S A INBREED MUSLIM! thats all you need to know about him. he's always trying to get the unbelievers to advance his political agendas. WAKE UP SHEEPLE!
Send in the swat with the tasers please.  Scratch that...lightening lances.
What a piece of shit, though we all knew this anyway. Let’s just move on, that steaming pile has already attracted too many flies.
And he has it on a special pad too! wtf
Lefto retard lying ????? WHO KNEW
even after so much backlash he cannot just get rid of the remote and the collar atleast for time being till it cools down 😂😂
The dog isn’t shocked by this video evidence.  Because the dog only gets shocked by Hasan.
Caught in 240p
If this is what gets Hasan banned and not the constant death threats and calls for violence I will cackle maniacally.
00:19 it was at this moment he knew.... He f*cked up.
Using an e-collar on your is not bad. Using an e-collar to keep your dog in the same position for bours is horrible
It's just a dog lmao People care way too much
Muslims hate dogs
Someone is obsessed 😂
Omg that's fucking funny.....
The dick riders will still find a way to say you're lying about it lmao
He’s so dumb 😭😭😭😭
Picture Hasan and Pirate Software arguing passionately about nothing. The door is locked until they agree on who’s in the wrong.
What an idiot. You'd think after all this drama, he would at least put it away.
bro thought he was slick. someone needs to save that poor dog
America deserved to be Shocked. Let kaya's duclaw ride on stage. Shock n zapp em.
The truth will always come out. This is God's work.
Is it just me or are asmongold and penguinZ0 slowly switching places
Palpatine piker
He move it out of frame because he realize deep down it wont look good for pr . Its kindda like criminal that kept getting away with crime eventually they got too lax and made a mistake .
There’s no way he isn’t using a shock collar anyone who says he’s not in either in denial as a delusional Hasan fan, in denial as a delusional Hasan orbiter, or in denial as a retard that lives in fantasy land
A narcissist will never admit any wrongdoing, it's not possible for them.
busted🫠 daaaaaaaamn this guy is such a loser and everyone whos defending him. POOR DOG
Next week: "It's finally over for Hasan. For real, for real this time. Pinky promise. Im serious!"
We all knew he was a lying piece of shit..
So at this point, its not *only* that he shocks the dog, but that he bullshitted the entire world too
Look if he said he uses the shock collar only for training purposes I would have been understanding and given him the benefit of the doubt. It's the fact that he keeps trying to hide it that makes him look worse.
It's not that he did what we all know he did, it's not even that he's pathetically trying to deny and conceal it... it's that his attempts to do so have the OPPOSITE effect of actually DEMONSTRATING HIS GUILT that's so amusing to me.  Like, how many people would've noticed the shock collar remote if Hasan hadn't made an effort to move it off screen?
“Let’s try another controlled shock”
Imagine having to be this narcissist's dog.... poor doggo.
Pretty sure he doesn't give a damn that people hate him for shocking his dog and is just engagement farming from all the attention he's getting
But wait theres a war in Gaza 😂😂
Lightning evidently DOES strike twice.
😂 the shock mfer felt there musta felt like a smite personally fisted from god himself and as it should serve him just. hope he keeps throwing rocks in his weak ass lil glass temple - hes so toxic we knew that, but towards animals - better not f with cats nor dogs, or any animal or person for that matter. please be excellent to one another, and let those who dont sit on their own blisters, and big ones ass-an has - thats a fact. peace
He deserves one on himself.
Wtf this cockroach lookin @ss nga laughing about, this is a syrys situation. This nga pmo
None of the people providing all of this 'evidence' of Hassan abusing his dog are qualified dog trainers also Palestine so....
Hasan's whole communication strategy is based around misrepresenting, lying, and never taking accountability (and doing it smoothly usually). His fans still ride for him and I dont think it will be different this time
I knew he was reaching for something (police joke here)
That's not for the dog collar. It's the remote for his vibrating plug.
It's not happening, that's a conspiracy theory. It happens sometimes and it's not a big deal. It's happening and here's why that's a good thing. The real problem are the people who are upset that it's happening.
Internet undefeated
You been saying this for months now 💤 😴 💤
okay but there are LITERALLY brown people in crisis 8,000 miles away soooo
He's even trying to hide it
Maximum retardation.
Where is he ... why dont we kill him ?
Never admitting you're wrong, even for little things, is trademark characteristic of the dark triad. The only question remaining for me is whether he is a sociopath or psychopath. Nothing shocking here.
Just the weirdest lie to be caught in if he just admited this would have been a nothing burger and just the peta bros would even remember it happened lol
He looks at the camera like those scammers caught in youtube videos
Inb4 he needs the shock collar to keep kaya from mauling orphaned children
Trump can make something really funny...
The comment section to PETA: "Now will you shoot him???" (Pirates of the Caribbean reference)
1:26 NPD = demonic
VICTORYYYYYYUY 🎉🎉🎉🎉
just like a true liberal, too much of a pussy to admit any fault. actual pathetic pos LOL
I'm shocked, shocked, well not that shocked... but the the dog is
desperate content do smth better
And still Twitch don't perma-ban him
Semites shouldn't be allowed to have dogs.
I pray for Hasan and Twitch's downfall
namuhbus
This hit 350k views in 3 hours...Hasan is cooked more than a stew, and his story his about to fall apart. Hasan Piker eat a fucking dick.
The worst part about this is, that even after seeing this, his audience will still try to defend it no matter what. Before this clip they said that its not a shock collar, now we gonna see them arguing why its actually a good thing that its a shock collar... 😅
And of course he’s gonna try to cover it up by gaslighting 😂
Hasan: Because I fuck underage girls at German brothels these losers are clipping me abusing my dog!
That's cool except you are doing much worse things and are just coping and blaming others
It almost feels like he’s trolling at this point tf
Now there can’t be any doubt. This is court-room level evidence of guilt.
Oh heck yea, I can't wait for nothing to happen
His 'followers' who still believe the words that come out of his mouth make me feel he is a cult leader manipulating their minds.
Israel has to be behind all this  - Hasan
He doesn't care. He knows twitch won't ban him because twitch owners are getting that oil money.
dog abuser...from the yard to the tree Kaya will be free 😠😠
Why does he have Christmas stuff up? Dude supports Muslim terrorist groups yet doesn't practice it? Does he know Muslims hate the unfaithful more than outsiders?
Ladies and Gentlemen, we officially got him! Any leftists that still support Hasan are basically advocating animal abuse at this point.
You have to be a serious sociopath if you could shock a dog to "educate" it to sit in one spot for hours. I feel bad just holding my cat for a few seconds when it wants to be let down.
I love this! I have never liked this guy I hope he gets herpies again
Wanda: "u kill cockroach and kick raccoon, u become a hero.  I shock dog and I'm a villain, that doesn't seem fair"
dude is a dog beater the worst type of person on earth.
Why are these leftist always so f-ed up??
Time to contact animal abuse services on him.
How will his fans mental gymnastics this one?
I want to fight Hasan on Livestream. Someone please help make this happen. I want to hurt him.
Can he just help with the other folks redecorating/moving his shit instead of sitting his ass like hes some royalty or something...
This has to be intentional. He can't be this dumb.
Poor dog, he/she deserves a better hooman :(
Heh, guess what? You can't erase stupidity.
Oh look, he moved it back to its normal resting place!
I can't explain to you guys how much I hate Hasan.
How often does he use the damn thing for it to be at arms length from him all the time
Get Cesar Milan to put a collar on him and "educate" his ass in a Live.
Both him and his poor dog are cooked.
Are we surprised?
Don't worry everyone everyday he gets closer to being put in jail
"Rules for thee but not for me"
Caught RED HANDED   next he’ll say it’s electro shock therapy to help with Kayas depression
If it wasn't a shock collar button he wouldn't have tried to hide it. I think this might be the smoking gun.
Yeah Hasan far right did this also
turkroach
Asmondgold and Hasan are in bed together to feed this bullshit, its a rigged economy based on a clicks  this is scum block it
we're gonna have a great morepegasus video tomorrow. Absolute Cinema
Absolute cinema
What a complete fool
just imagine those electrical collar on people. that's what he wants... total dictatorship. i mean he acts like one.
I really wish he could wake up with the collar around his neck, hands tied behind his back and Kaya at the remote. I also wish it would be live streamed... Please, I need this.
But but but asmond, THERE'S A GENOCIDE GOING ON!!!!!
Well gonna be seeing this clip next pegasus video lol
It won't be over until Hasan is wearing the shock collar and the button is wired to Asmongold's stream donations.
No, guys, you don't understand. It's another misunderstanding. It's just his pocket watch
Shocker
If he lying about this what else is he lying about? Dude can't be trusted. But almost everyone here already knows that.
he dont care he knows he will never get canceled or banned everyone dik suckin him
I think this is a social experiment, that is the only way to explain this nonsense
lolololololo
All of you guys are dumb af, seriously look into off leash dog training and so on. It literally has 250 different volt settings. Multiple vibrations, and a speaker for cues. If you’ve ever trained an off leash dog or an agility dog then you’ve most likely used one of these collars. I have the PE-900 pro, it’s amazing for my off leash service animal. Doing agility with them is amazing as you can train both noise and vibration cues for ease of use. IF YOU’RE GOING TO USE ONE make sure YOU get trained first and slowly introduce your dog into it using positive reinforcement training. The electrical portion is for last resort.   Now the fact that he felt the need to hide it and acted like he was caught doing something bad is a different story, maybe he is abusing it and just zaps his dog on the highest setting but who knows.
What did he say the last time? Visual evidence?
Why would Hasan remove and get rid of the shock collar if it means bending to "the will of his opponents". His keeping the shock collar is arguable or quite literally an act of rebellion. He doesn't feel remorse. He hates the people who call him out. He probably hates his dog. He cares about image more than anything else
Until Hasan goes to prison it won't be over.
mods please unban me from his chat, pleassssss
Didnt anybody tell ya, dont go messing with karma.
I wonder if his mum knows.
Proof that commies do it for the power, not for the proletariat... also the way he goes "MaYaaa" as he hits the button is a subconscious tell, an admission of guilt.
plot twist Kaya actually like it and Hassan was forced to do that (LOL)
The funniest part is, it's the ET-800, which is for large dogs over 50lbs (Kaya) and shocks even harder.
The sociopath is COOKED!!!
There’s a photo of Hassan at Dairy Queen proving it couldn’t have been him hitting the remote 😜
Please I hope to see a Meatcanyon video about this
Well, after the first video i was already convinced that hasan dicker would absolutely shock his dog. But kudos to the people hounding his every move for more evidence.   Why is Dicker still getting the benefit of doubt after countless examples....
Can we stop talking and someone send me the fricking dogs please? Good home here on Skye for all dogs affected by the feckin Pikers
Yeah, this is just going to be added to the numerous videos of him "being cooked" and then nothing comes of it.
dumb roach
How many times is it over already?
Dear jd Vance, please arrest this evil man 🙏
Bro, if I was in his position, I'd ditch the collar and remote whenever I streamed. This just shows he's not only a jerk to his dog, he's also dumb af.
YOU CANT LIE TO THE INTERNET IF YOU HAVE CAMERAS IN YOUR HOUSE. Fuckin 50iq ass retard.
Bro got B.U.S.T.E.D, he got busted 🎶
He's a muslim and they hate dogs cause the kohran forbids them to touch any dogs of superstitious bad luck
He moves it out of shot exactly how a scene from a movie would do it.😂
Got em!
please someone compile all these clips and add the video where he said pets are slaves
Thunder God Hasan
There’s no such thing as bad publicity look at Trump
I want to know why peta hasn't gone after this fukn loser. It's so blatantly obvious he's shocking that poor dog just because the dog doesn't want to be on Camera wants to get up and move around
Jellywig "LET UP THOSE VOLTAGES*
This guy wants to get caught, he wants people to talk about him, fame or infamy it doesn't matter.
i dont get it why is hasan still here, mf should be locked in prison by now
How did someone so stupid get so many followers. Hasan is a fucking retard.
Gotta keep thatJew dogs greasy paws off his nice hardwood floor.  What a f**king scumbag. Good job detectives !👏
The thing that angers me the most is that...  ... nothing ever happens.
His new channel name should be “Kayabuser” 😪
No one should be surprised a terrorist sympathizer electrocutes his dog.
What's next, not shocking your dog makes you racist?
Everything Hasan has said, threatening and advocating violence and spreading misinformation or outright lying... It figures his downfall would be that he also abuses his pets. 💀
Bros own camera is betraying him.
He could literally hit the dog and still go on as if nothing happened.  That dude is uncancellable.
It's not funny... I think it was never funny... KAYA😢
Save that dog
Not beating the allegations lmfao.
Don't worry.... he doesn't use shock.... LOL no way people still eating his BS
Bro that a pirate software with the discord dms
Im so happy to see truth shine!   All of these shallow evil hustkers are being exposed.
Most pissfulls practice Al taqiya. Nothing new here.. has been happening for centuries
Yeah, I had some snarky remark, but these comments… chefs kiss. There’s no need. 🤣
Put it on his, Hasan, on his neck! Buzz buzz!😜
He's an animal abuser and criminal by where he lives.  4CHAN we got another can has cheeseburger event.  Operation save Kaya when!?
He should be forced to wear it and get shocked for as long as Kaya has!
Twitch is being funded by Muslim brotherhood otherwise he would have been cancelled a long time ago
Dogs are the worse
That's it, this has gone on long enough!!! Time to let Girl With The Dogs know!!!
Now what? Can't stand this ahole anyway!
Why is every leftist YouTuber just a secret aristocrat who wants to own slaves and sleep with minors???
I will only forgive him if he puts the collar on and lets his chat push the button for 4 hours 😂  Jk I wouldn’t forgive but I’d like to see it!
This guy is really retarded 😂 I didn’t think he  could get any more retarded honestly
Who knew that Hassan was a POS... as if shit coming out of his mouth wasn't enough 😂😂😂
I think the biggest problem with society is that; none of this incident and whole event is going to change anyone's minds. The people that used to hate Hasan will still hate him. And the people that love Hasan already support everything he says and are okay with this, so they will still love him.
He is worse than a Bond villain. The level of evil required to use a shock collar to confine his own dog to a tiny space for hours per day as a prop, and to be visibly angered if the poor dog just wants to stretch his legs..  He is an oppressive authoritarian psychopath fraud making a career pretending to have compassion for oppressed people.
They are all animal abuser
Dudes fucked kids in other countrys and stalked his ex but this is what did it lol
His room looks so staged. His life is so staged...
o god hahaahha cancel thi hasan man
You guys are so wrong that's just his other electric shock collar.
Been a Ruff week for hama err hasan.
CANCEL HIM
He hates his dogs
And they still defend him.
It will never be over, cenk's nephew is 100% teflon : nothing stick, cannot be removed once it contaminated the area, toxic and cancerous.
So what was the list of leftist rethorical steps again? Denial, reluctant acknowledgment, reframing it as positive ... and now maybe mandatory promotion? Is Hasan gonna' tell his viewers to get shock collars?
Should put it on him.
I saw a dog video ad in front of this.
Shocking!
Hasan is all round a piece of shit.
why celebrate Christmas when you hate Christain's so much ,   what a pos
He said those who don't want to be injected with a "vaccine" should be forced to...maybe we should forcibly relieve him of his dog.
guys guys it's a shock collar of peace, you see.
people need to look further back. when that dog was young he said he fed it napkins with his semen on it to the dog.
I laughed, my bros laughed, the dog laughed, the dog got shocked
It's so over 😆
Zack please run for president ❤
Classic, just got a 14 day ban from livestreamfail for saying Hasan's an animal abuser and should be banned off Twitch. I genuinely thought his paid moderators had moved on or that he'd lost control of that subreddit, but apparently not.
A month from now everyone will have forgotten this was even a thing and there will be some new huge nonsense that everyone's fixated on.
He will deny this forever
what kind of moose-limb has an inside dog and celebrates xmas?!?!
The kind of person that forced poison on their dog because the bunker is about to be overrun
Its over for the 347 time, but this time is for real.......🥱🥱🥱
Good, keep getting evidense so he can be charged with animal cruelty.
Sure would be a shame if someone shared his address in Granada hills and someone then unfortunately used that information to bring a baseball bat to talk to him
hasan literally stop lying  its clear what u are doing
I love how all of this could've prevented if he just said in the beginning "Yes, it's a schock collar. I heard it's a normal trainingstool... it is not? I'm sorry i won't do it again"
What's the deal with the Christmas tree and decorations? Isn't he all about Aloha Snackbar?
It's not "over" till the dog is REMOVED from his house at the minimum!!
He's just a chronic liar. Plain and simple.
Shocking that exactly how it appeared was exactly what it was.
He knows he's doing something horrible, and he is still doing it, then he tries to hide it and lies about it. Absolutely despicable.
How do people like this not understand how the Internet will react?
Deport him to dog island 🏊‍♂️ 🏝️ 🐕🐶
destiny with underage kids hasan with animal cruelty  both criminals
LOL ASMONGOLD 😂AND THOUSANDS BOT OVERTIME NOW $7000 PER POST😂The propaganda has gotten a little bit better but still not very convincing
It wouldn’t have even been as bad if he didn’t just try to lie. Like if he goes yes I collar train her, it’s really low but she’s a sensitive princess, I think it would have blown over. I also don’t think it helps that he always seems to do it out of frustration.
Bro was caught 4k😂
Caught in 4k
every streotype on his kind checks out.. abusing dogs, lies more than he breathes... waiting for the next edition
Hasan Piker is a hypocrite demented piece of 💩
So is no one going to question why the Christmas tree?
Put the collar on him. Tie him to his chair. Connect the remote to twitch subs. Watch him beat Vedal/Neuro's hypetrain. 😂
His fans already have no morals so sadly this will not affect him
The internet - We got em boys, time for the POS to be held accountable.. Those who control the internet - Trump war trump distraction oh look racism.....
It no surprise he is an animal abuser. He supports terrorists and wants people dead, you think he actually gives a shit about his dog, he uses her a prop and treats her like shit. I hope she shits in his shoes.
Hasan : It's AI VIDEO!
He is shockingly dumb
nice that Twitch is promoting this person, treats him nice and looks away over all he´s mistakes
At this point, you can trust that Hasan will always lie.
Why doesnt he just say he uses it? Because he is guilty of abusing his dog with it and he has been busted by people who know this kind of covert narcissistic sadism when they see it.
Now imagine you're in a position where you can't be critical of Hasan.  Like, your staff puts out a cancellation notice and two days later Pokimane panics and says "Nah it was always gonna get posted, hang on while I fire everyone I'm blaming for posting this thing they wouldn't have posted without instructions to do so"
She clipped her paw.  Okay I used a vibrator collar on her. Okay I shocked her and this is why it's a good thing.
Hamas piker been found out to the dog abusing turkroach he’s always been
How does he has fans I don't get it?
he will never admit it
If it aint a shock collar he should put it on and activate it
Is anyone besides the dog shocked?
And some hasan fans would STILL defend him
Hasan shows every time he’ll lie for his narrative. Only retards would watch him and believe anything he says.
what moron would acknowledge using a DEVICE THAT IS ILLEGAL IN MOST PLACES ACROSS THE WORLD ******* but typical usa be like  "Duhhhhhhhhh"
So nobody has taken this guy out yet?
The question is why there is camera setup up there
Pathalogical liars man. You can only get them to self recognize that they are lying and that's as close as you'll ever get them to admit it because it's all non-verbablly said.
poor pup ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The shocking will stop when morale improves
💀
it should be illegal for dirty subhuman vermin muzrats to have own or have any access to animals.
'slims hate dogs
Was the collar tested on humans, because it needs to be...
what does this actually prove? nothing. ya'll are actually brain washed. release the epstein files.
If he lies about this,  he lies about everything
He never admits he's wrong because he's a child in a man's body. In fact, even some children take more accountability than this guy.
We need a meat canyon
How many thousands of hours of streams did people comb through to find these?  Respect the 'tism.
What happened with Dan Clancy in front of the senate?
⚡🐶⚡
So why arent the ASPCA and the police involved
I had an argument with my friend about this.  He was trying to claim there was 0 evidence of a shock collar and him reaching to his left doesnt mean anything....Well I sent him this video and I havent heard back yet🤣
Can't wait for his community to explain this one
next thing, Hasan Glazer's going to say. It's just the remote for the vibrator
Does this change anything? Is he getting reported for animal cruelty or banned from Twitch? If not, this is just another commercial, for getting away with idiocy.
Hasan’s muslim, not surprised he’d do shit like this.
I really don’t think it’s that big of a deal to have a shock collar for your dog tons of people have them but it’s really weird he’s lying about it
There was a second shocker on the grassy knoll.
Narrator: it actually was over this time
Ladies and gentlemen.... We got em...
His ego could never let him just admit it. He's in too deep.
Doggo > Champaign Socialists
Here's the thing, when used properly it can be a tool for training.  I don't think most trainers would say use it to keep your dog on a bed while you stream for 4 plus hours and shock her when she gets up.
This POS is on the same level as Cyraxx.  Subhuman scum.
Proof he shocks his dog. Thats abuse. He is torturing a poor animal. On top of that. He  supports the genocide of innocent jewish people. Hasan is the nazi.
Hates fascism but he's a fascist to his dog.
God forbid the dog wants to move around a little bit and not have to lay down in a spot all day. The only reason he has him is for a sense of control and superiority. The poor pup.
Assman Gould out here begging for scraps? Lol
Evil human. With a cult delusional following. And they vote….. embarrassing
So she's a non-Free Range dog?
Of course terrorist sympathizer scum would shock his dog
The crazy thing is I think a lot of people aren’t even against shock collars. It’s the fact he’s doing it because his dog got up from that bed for 5 seconds after laying there for 4 hours. That’s like some sick addiction to power.
literally treats his dog like a prop and electrocutes it when its tired of staying in the same place. thats animal abuse. plain and simple
And twitch is not gonna do anything to thiS POS because they are corrupt...
Got em
Incredibly cruel
I guess its better than shooting it
Y'all are OBSESSED over Hasan, I swear! Let it freakin' die already, Jesus H. Christ!! 🤣🤣
Electrocuting your dog just so it stays in frame for your viewers is actually diabolical, that man displays all signs of a narcissistic psychopath.
This does not prove or disprove anything? The ET-300, ME-300 and PG-300 remotes have the same design that you can buy replacement skins for. Even if your Pro-shock and believe it is the ET-300 or Pro-vibration and believe it is the PG-300 it is a nothing argument whichever side you are on.
So when will it really be over? What does "over" constitute?
Its funny that on his recent stream with all the video angles, you still cant see that side of the desk 😂
Can twitch ban him now faking already??
Crazy that a guy who supports Israel made this vid
at this point its just way to obvious that hasan is the biggest idiot on the internet
AND THEN ALONG CAME ZEUS
Ultimately,  the dog is the martyr.. Sadly
This is weird to pay this much attention to this - who cares?
WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT
C'mon guys he's literally Raiden from MK, the defender of Earth realm. He's defending humankind with his streams, but you know, had to shock something
What an absolute clown 🤦🏾‍♂️
True lolcow, just endlessly unloading clips into his own foot.
It's called narcissism.
When asmon said "you have a fuck up like this and thats it." Im sure he ment Hassan himself.
Hamas Diddy Piker
*people calling him out for reaching for a button* hasan trying to wave that away with his usual sarcasm: "oh yeah, in my evil villains lair"   ...aged like MILK
damn y'all just love milking every last atomic level of content out of lies and misinformation lol
Dog is not even allowed to move or breath for that matter
This guy is a world class scumbag.
It’s insane how Kaya could be worried about a little shock when there’s literally a war in Gaza rn
An idiot beyond belief
Omg lol
He'll come up with an awful excuse and his orbiters will continue to glaze themselves empty for him.
Nothing will happen.
Narcisst plain and simple. One thing I've known and noticed is that narcisst's CAN NOT admit they are wrong. Even if it's very minor, they will not and can not admit they are wrong. Also, they can never apologize even if they are proven to be wrong.
*Shocking!*
Hasan is a fucking psychopath
bruh is a professional hypocrite, my lawd this is beyond embarassing what a total tool😂
Yo hopefully this is what dominos his downfall
Mosad planted it
He really just left it in the same spot? I shouldn’t be surprised, but I am
Typical leftist liar at it again!
Why is nobody reporting him to Californian authorities? Live by the soy, die by the soy.
This means not only is it a shock collar/remote… He’s been trying to hide it THE WHOLE TIME because he KNEW it was morally wrong!
bro really thought he was smooth with move that out of the way and casually getting a cookie
An animal abuser will always be an ugly bitch.
Can somebody _please_ put that f--ke- in jail already?
He won't be able to use the genocide excuse this time .
Trump -  "they're tasing the dogs!"
Send this to the guys at 4chan
Pack it up hamas...damn 😹😭
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Hahahaha deny deny deny.
i feel sorry for the dog man .....
Well well weeell
Has Anybody Reported Him To The Proper Authorities?
Nah it’s just for his vibrator in his asshole
No one needs to be taken down like Hassan. He’s a nepo baby who has never had a real job and he gained his fame making incel videos called bro tips where he’d tell guys how to trick drunk women into sleeping with them.  He’s a real pos
Somehow Hasan shocking his dog has returned
Dude needs to be punched in the face. Not advocating for violence but..
What is wrong with him having a shock collar....? i dont get it
No one is shocked but the dog.
Imagine if he.pressed it by accident and the dog squeals lol
bro that is so cringe. like catching a toddler taking a cookie out of the cookie jar
He’s waiting for that dog to croak and attention farm for it.
Hasan is one big fat cuh'n. Imagine trying to be all saint with your views on the world while being a puh'sei arse bih'ch to your dog. He must be banned from streaming for good and possibly locked up for animal abuse.
1:19 Isn't that a premise for being a leftist?
lol, "another plane has hit the towers"
So... Can Pokimane apologize now?
ah geez
internet blow this up Please!!! 🙏🙌
Hamas "Pirate Software" Piker
"Video games cause violence"  Me:"No they dont, but this does *plays clip of Hasan abusing his dog* "  Hey Hasan I want you to meet Sasha.
Smh. Someone needs to take that poor dog away from him
Where I grew up, shock collars were pretty common. Invisible fencing for dogs was common and electric fences to keep livestock in place are also common. This dude sucks, no doubt, but I don't know if this is the end game people want it to be.
hasan is such a loser at least if he does not care just come out and say it
*The left are pathetic. Deny. Subvert. Admit but claim it’s not bad etc.*
Hasan torturing his dog when there's a genocide going on
Narcissistic people can never admit when they’ve done wrong or made a mistake. It’s part of their messed up personality.
Its ACTUALLY joever, its all all ogre now
why do they always lie about everything man
I think out of the 50 people I know that have used stock collars, guaranteed 45 returned it for cruelty reasons, 3 never used it twice and the other 2 I lost contact with. He is so concerned about getting laid that he bought a living prop. He cares more about his stream than life itself, therefore the dog must be tortured into obedience.
What is bigger news, this or the Gaza war?
Now he is gonna blame it on AI, trust
1:12 bro wth is wrong with this guy
So desperate for looks...
Never admit he's wrong sounds like a certain someone I know too. Ehem Pirate Software.
This guy gives shame to the Islamic community
I have the same exact collar for my dog. Its basically a tap on his neck when its below 10. For a dog to yelp like it did it would be at 30+
Asmongold is Yoda; Hasan is Palpatine  Change my mind. Asmon even laughs like Yoda, where Hasan looks good on the outside, but that’s a mask, and he’s terrible on the inside.  Oh and the obvious “Wise Yodasmon” and the “Hasan Unlimited power Abi”
That shows he knows what he's doing. He even looks at the camera all guilty. Gross.
Hasan is too much of a narcissist to come clean about anything he lies about.
Just so everyone knows this Dan Clancy has yet to go infront of congress and had to be reschedueled to a different date, so hasan is literally digging Dan Clancy in a bigger hole
There we have it.  Internet  solved Kaya’s abuse. This is why you dont give up
Alright can we cancel hasan now
Can't wait for whatever mental gymnastics his orbitors/compromised streamer buddies will come up with this time besides "but the genocide bro"
If anyone knows were this guy lives call the animal cruelty center on his dumb as
Like a baby covered in chocolate saying he didn’t eat it. Hasan is a gaslighting moron. What a stupid baby.
Can the feds just blackbag this creature already? He belongs in a blacksite.
It's just the remote to his vibrating buttplug bro
We all know he's just a constant liar but losers that follow him will continue to make excuses. He's been shocking the dog for years but managed to keep it off stream because he KNOWS it's a bad look.
He’s still got a million excuses before he finally gets to the classic “come on guys it’s not that bad”
Imagine what else he has to hide...
I can't imagine the look on his orbiters realizing the script now requires them to justify animal abuse.   Because terrorism, death threats, advocating for violence etc wasn't hard enough for them.
Hasan has to have the "Correct" answer on every subject, to the point that he's contorting himself into a pretzel, just so everyone views him as the all knowing, perfect being, who can do no wrong ever. Its fascinating to observe.
He can eat crow now 😂
That electricity is palestininan and was generating cleanly using renewable energy, so it's ok to shock the dog with it.
F****NG DUMBASS.
Why does he wear such oversized ladies' sweaters?
I'm sure that's just the remote for the v*brator he has up his a**😂
CAUGHT!!!
Is he doing this on purpose?
Hasan/11 was an inside job
Wow, shocker.  pun not intended.
I hope this ends him. Permanently.
We are more persistent about this than we were with the Epstein files, and I'm here for it 🤣
Internet humanity is scary man. How the hell they find this? 😂
He should hide it using epstein file pages.
Homeboy is dumb af 🤣
nothing will happen to this guy. even if he said "yeah it is a shock collar, i was lying the whole time" then picked up the remote shocked the dog to death then streamed with the dog's decaying corpse over the next month.
You know he’s a sociopath because he’s putting up a Christmas tree in mid October.
Why you always lyyyyyin 🎶🎵
You don’t understand he has to do it so his dog can understand the plight of Palestinians
Thats the remote for his vibrating buttplug😂😂
Hes just shocking the dog in case theres any Jewish in her. Its fine.
At least he hates JUICE. Still ok by me.
"no wait guys, that's his new rumba that he built himself, it's a prototype so he has to hide it for the patent" Hasan audience, probably xd
Disgusting communist animal abusing swine.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we fucking got him
Is Hasan mentally challenged?
Oh no! A fourth piece of incontrovertible evidence? Hasans viewers who thought you were all national socialists after three peices of incontrovertible evidence will definitely be swayed by a fourth piece of incontrovertible evidence.
He Is A 10000% cOoKeD
it's not easy to deal with the habit ya😂
the chickens have come home to roost
You can see the precise moment he notices its there when he pauses and grabs his shirt.
imagine being a bigger bitch than your female dog.
Why is nobody kicking his ass or calling the cops!?
I actually really like Piker but he's a fucking regard for this
I hope the dog gets taken away and put in a loving home
Hands up dont shock
Why does anyone watch him.
Guards, send that man to the dungeon.
Anyone reported this yet ? Where does he live?
The way he moves as "oh I was just grabbing a snack" and looking at the camera after. Could you look more guilty?
Lyin Ted! 😂
Would anyone be noticing if he hadn't (guiltily) moved it from view?   He KNOWS its wrong. The only thing more wrong is Twitch for streaming it.
It's the only way he can quit streaming is if he is "forced" to. I can see you Hasan. Keep it up. You will be free soon.
Idk why, but can you just let the doggo go to the yard and spend the time there? Or hire some of your orbiters to take care the mascot doggo while you three in the front of the camera... Probably not because it's violates Palestinians if we do that, and it's see as a very Israel like gestures  Truly a genocidal actby Ethan and AsmonPapa😅😂
Straight collargate  lmao who ever made that up
The fake outrage is hilarious while you Nazis cheer on Kristi Noem.😂😂😂 I'm so glad this guys parents and his colleague are dead.
What's funny about it? you def don't deserve the following that you have, not you nor that worm Hasan.
so Hasan and PirateSoftware, which one has greater ego?
Hasan is SUCH a retard.
Pokimane-approved
If there was anyone who was technically legal but who should be deported to El Salvador anyway...
Can't stand pet abusers. What a fucking nob.
Shocking a dog that moved an inch is NOT a small mess up. I dont use shock collars, but Im not against them. Using them cause your dog wanted to walk around after sleeping is cruel and inhumane.
Get exposed!
Free kaya from this Turkish dog abuser!
keep the snowball ❄️⚽ roll
what a dumb fuck piece of garbage cunt ass bitch hASSan is.
But why have a dog if it's so annoying to have one? Just give it to anyone that actually would love a dog. They'll take care of it and it'll live a happier life being free of unnecessary training and shocking.
at this point.....what does it matter? nothing is ever going to happen to him and his sycophants will always glaze him.
Free kaya from this socialist pig!!!
gaslighting the internet as a whole is next level of dumb and always doesn't end well. 😂
free kaya!!!
Bro 5000 % cooked
I like that his microphone is yellow since he runs a sensationalism channel as all channels should if they use this as a tool regardless of allignment
It’s only a matter of time before he admits he does. But I’m just worried about him gaslighting his audience into thinking shock collars are good.
its called "Narcissism" (deeeep deeeep deeeep down he knows he's a POS loser, but lying makes him feel good)
remember leftists do everything they accuse others of
Now lets put the shock collar on hasan to train him to be less of a POS. ;(
he doesn't ever admit he's wrong because psychopaths are incapable of admitting they are wrong!  Why do you think politicians can't ever admit they were wrong?
Animal Abuser Hasan
Caught in 4k. How many times is he going to get caught until he admits it 😂
No matter how idiotic is to have a pet only to abuse it, it still baffles me how people are willing to scratch the bottom OF THE CORE OF THE EARTH if needed, only to screw someone over politics. If it wasn't the dog, he would been flamed for killing a fly on stream.  Can't you people just say "I hate him because of his politics"? What, admitting it is going to ruin your self-proclaimed hero image?  Edit: AND STOP SELF-VALIDATING YOURSELVES SAYING "PSYCHOPATH" AND "NARCISSIST", FOR GOD'S SAKE, ARE THOSE THE ONLY WORDS YOU KNOW?! What do we even have tertiary education for, if people only know two words?
Average leftist honestly
Justice must be done for the little animal that suffers the consequences of a madman who lacks a heart.
poor dog , I mean the real dog
Oh boy
Kawksuker!!!
The downfall baby
Yes dude, whoever combed through hours of footage to cook this cocksucker is the real unsung hero in this collargate arc
What??? Are you telling me that a guy who supports terrorist groups and celebrates the murdering of people with different political views is a sociopath that abuses his dog? WOW I’m shocked! Who could’ve guessed???
Good lord the internet is just relentless, I'm not impressed that they had time time and focus to do stuff like this 😂 it's autistic focus like this that got us to the moon
They don’t hate the police, ICE, etc. they hate the power they hold… they just want to be them so they can tell all of us what to do!
Badly bearded Hasan is busted.
A true narcissist
How about just not forcing the dog to sit in one spot during your insane podcast…Hassan’s an asshat
People are in denial if they thought he didn’t reach for the remote, if my dog yelped like Kaya did (and had a dead nail or whatever lie he used) I would have gone straight over to see what was wrong. He’s so full of crap.
that poor dog
Boom goes the dynamite! 💥
how is this funny? just take him to jail
remember how hassa laugh at ethan button guys?
Can't wait for the inevitable lolcow mental breakdown all such personalities have after which they can't go back
He is way too stupid to realize his own stupidity 🥀
We forgetting what this rat face said against an entire people and had to backtrack Becuase he knew he fucked up but cries over a dog collar? 😂😂 Fugly ass dog deadass
Gonna say is ai
Absolute. Retard.
And remember he puts the collar on so tight on her that a guest wasn't able to fit even one finger under it, when you're supposed to be able to fit 2.
He is one sick individual. It's all about control 😢
😢😢
Send this to Ethan immediately
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You gotta admit, he played this stinking city like a harp from hell!
Who cares seriously?  Dog is being mistreated, people realize the pos Hasan is a grifter just like Asmon.   If both were thrown in the normal world they would eat that dog for a knickel.  Nothing new.
So? Nothing will ever happened.
Dude, thank god the internet came together and has proven this dude guilty. What a beautiful thing people can accomplish when we all have a common goal...     And to the people who kept defending this dude and STILL defends him. Go shock yourself.
He look to the camera exactly like perpetrator in every crime footage. 😂
hasan fans will watch this and say this doesn't proof anything
I'm shocked. SHOCKED I SAY! Well not that shocked.
absolute smoking gun
Animal abusers get the kiln
There's nothing wrong with a shock collar, they can be helpful in emergencies to snap a dog out of something like a fight, or chasing wildlife, or emergency recall. But using it to keep your dog in frame for a live stream is diabolical
THE JEWS PLACED THAT WIIMOTE DILDO ON HIS DESK, GUYS HES DEFINITELY NOT GAY!!!
He did a FOOL’S BITE after he moved the remote!!😂😂😂
Need to shove that collar up his loose, transtifa-loving ass and lay a brick on that "juice" button. POS terrorist supporting nepobaby.
BZZZZZT 🐕‍🦺
And people still defending him is crazy man
When I posted on his video(s) about there literally being black tape covering where the prongs should be, brand name etc., he would block me and post a new stream of the same content without my comment being visible. He’s obviously lying at this point 😅
Why do people care this dude can stream death to people and abuse animals and nothing is going to happen all you do is give both Asmon and Hasan views and accomplish nothing.
Dumbass😂
😂
Imagine what else he lies about daily.
But but but the Hasan fans told it was not true lol
" I would never use it. But they are incredibly effective"  -Hassan on shock collars. 😂😅
PETA won't do anything to save this dog as they're complicit in identity politics
Hasan is not going to admit it.. but some of his guests probably saw him pressed the button and they can be questioned.
XAP
At first I thought Hasan was just a hypocrite running his bs with logic holes in his every sentence, but now I'm seriously doubting he may be re***ed or senile at this point.
It so over lol
Crazy how twitch loves the abuse of animals.
It is the right of every leftist and muslim to be able to shock their dogs. If you disagree with this you are a facist
Engagement fuel ⛽️
Literal Scum
😂
Why are people digging for more stuff everyone knows alr now js deal with it
Hasan is unironically living the american psycho life as a twitch streamer
"I did not shock my dog, but if I did, this is how I would do it."----Hassan
Muslims... god damn f k n muslims!
He should have let Sam Hyde beat his punk ass.
Listen, Kaya is sitting all day because she has a lack of energy due to a super rare genetic diseas that affect her nervous system!  Poor dog! If not for me (Hassan), charging her up every now and then, she woild literally be dead!  I am doing such a good job, saving this poor dog's life, but nooo, those... Those NAZIs like Asmongold just cannot comprehend that someone can genuinely do good without shoving it in our faces 24 7, God I HATE them so much, I don't even know how they still exist.
All Hasan needs to say is look guys I support terrorists who brutally murder people cutting their heads off and you think I give a fck about a dog or wouldn't shock it and everything will go back to normal for him. Hasan could literally tell his viewers the dog bit a Free Palestine protester and that it deserved to be shocked and his viewers would support the shocking
he covets the power the shocker gives him
it's a rosetoy
Hasan is 500% fucked 😂
How much do we need to say this, he’s a muslim!
Hasan will call his dad now.
Hasan's a literal fucking retard.
Bruh send him to hail
He's never going to admit to it. Unless you have undeniably video proof of a remote sitting in that spot ..... wait....really? There's fucking video of the remote sitting in the same spot?? Holy fucking shit
Shocking that a guy who would groom female streamers on twitch would also be a piece of shit who abuses his dog.
yea, my parents had that exact collar for their Labrador during dog training when my mom got cancer. too funny lmaoooo
Forcing a dog to remain in one spot for hours at a time prevents natural behaviors like stretching, walking, or relieving itself. Extended immobility can lead to muscle stiffness, discomfort, and stress, especially with him constantly angrily yelling. But whenever Kaya tries to move she exhibits classic fear based submissive behaviors: freezing, lowering her head, walking backward to her spot immediately after Hasan’s shouts her name.
How come this fool hasn’t become subject to investigation? Can one of you Americans send all of his misdeeds to an animal protection service because he seriously needs to be prosecuted. Anyone who tortures animals for entertainment is a sick f*** and needs to be dealt with. Come one America, do something about it
I hope the dogs unalives hassan and eats his face. That would be a hassan stream id actually pay for to watch
WE FOUND YELLOW CAKE! 😂😂
hypocrisy at its peak.
Communists kill all their dogs. I don't know why no one brings this up when they're discussing Hassan. A communist being cruel to a dog should be no surprise.
If a streamer goes against its audience its over for him there’s no way one never had a slip up ever
Its over when the candyman stands triumphant over the ko`ed body of this rich socialist cnt.
Died like a dog
Lady's and gentlemen, we got him
Hasan is the typical commie, allergic to accountability, cannot tell the truth, is evil incarnate, "hates" power or authority (but only when it's used against his side, however he gleefully abuses any power he has and he cheers on LITERAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS!)... Oh, and he has a large active type of dog that is a specialty breed, which is being abused with serious negative reinforcement training JUST FOR USE AS A STATIONARY PROP!!!
I was waiting for charlie to react because hassan called him out 😂
Hasan behaves like a mischievous child. This is probably my favorite Hasanabi controversy of all time😂
Someone needs to teach this Hasan guy a lesson.
That look he gave the camera is the look a kid gives when he knows he's caught. 😂
Hello, is this Agent 49? Yeah. Mhm. Sweet, so you are in the area? Can you take this job? Great! I'll wait for your pizza delivery.   Huh? What did you think I was talking about! Racist extremist hateful evil nazi alt tekno alt f4 scumbags!
Hasan needs to step his lying game up to live up to the Democrat name
I had said when i saw you initially address this, that the timing was just too perfect between him smacking the table and the dog jumping, and it wasn't him startling the dog...
I've never seen the guy genuinely laugh.  Commies only like laugher when it begins with an S.
hassan piker electro dog striker
wow who could have guessed hasan was lying this entire time and trying desprately to cover it up!? im sure philip defranco will report all about this tomorrow.....
yikes
Look at that a piece of shit streamer who abuses his dog why get a dog if you don’t want to take responsibility for a animal
Now people can straight up call on him for animal abuse
This reminds me of DSP.  Oh, the camera was on the whole time?
I love that this just keeps getting worse for him.
Yall just don’t understand good dog training. Too stupid to know that shock collars are good and should be used on dogs who change positions- yall don’t know that cause yall can’t afford the expensive training he put his dog through. It’s not like she was electrocuted- she yelped in pain because she’s super spoiled by his mom. If you were as rich as him-you would understand! Also love the typical progressive pattern of liars: It didn’t happening-ok it happened but it was only that one time-ok it happens a whole lot and it’s good that it happened.
Yup, he's over, he's cooked 😂
I don't think the guy who praises terrorists and promotes them on his stream really cares about electrocuting his dog
That whole family is sick.
Sweet. So he’s a dishonest POS who will probably end in a hole because he needs to.
It fits perfectly that people who follow Hasan religiously are also people who are midwits
Then you have these other bozo streamers exposing themselves to being clout goblin loosers. From the rivers to the sea Kaya will be free
When I first saw this clip and compared it to the first pic of the remote I was like "could be, but not a 100%" but then I saw the back. It's like everything just clicked into place.
Who need evidence if you can just lie to prove it 😂😂
Hasan is as smooth as fuckin sandpaper
Justice would be him wear it a week 4 shocks a day if hes nice
Give us back Charlie Kirk and take hasan
How many times you gonna talk about this guy.  How about both you pussies just fighting each other.
From the hydrant to the tree, Kaya will be free!
Evo Electro Wizard gameplay leaked
What does it actually take for animal abuse to cause someone to take his dog from him. I feel like something should legally happen by now
Hey, don't wrongly accuse someone! Maybe it's a remote for the stick up his-
Nahhhhhh that's the remote for the vibrator he has up his ass we all know it guys right?
Either that's a shock collar remote or a wireless dildo remote.
"WHY WOULD YOU MAKE ME DO THIS?" -Hasomni-man
😂playing with fire and he burned himselfe 😂
ET-300!!
His type of people preach their hatred to abuse of power and power itself for no other reason than that they do not hold it.  I knew a politician in a corrupt party that held power that barely spoke, only acted like a licking dog, for decades! Then, guess what? When he was kicked out like a dog, he suddenly became a warrior of justice and preacher of integrity.   Shocking! Though not as shocking as an 'educator' is
hes psychopathic guaranteed. craves control, constantly lies, manipulative behaviour, cronic narcissist...its just so obvious. literally stealing my air
👍
pls repot hasen to fbi or something
Using the collar for training is okay.  The problem is he shocks her for moving.  He's using it to keep her in that spot as a prop.
Wild.
Bro hasan is so d.mb people will find your address in this age and he thinks the tape was going to work
''NO'' lol These people are ALWAYS guilty, always.
But why is he setting up Christmas decorations in October?
fuck LSF for hiding an animal abuser and fuck everyone not willing to call Hasan out
if his community doesnt turn on him its undeniable proof that theyre spineless snakes that emotionally grift towards whatever topic they think is pertinent
The one's defending Hasan, especially his LA Friends must be Animal Abusers too. No Doubt,  This is the one time I'd say they where being Guilty by Association actually fits. If they're able to do that to an animal, imagine what they'd do to people.. oh wait.. they already did.
ain t no way he celebrates christmas
He straight up lies to his viewers faces they are cucks
Now I genuinely believe everything he is doing and saying is only to gain relevency so people keep talking about him and he knows nothing is going to happen to him.  you can't do that much fuck up in one week by mistake
WOW! The leftwing liberal that advocates the streets to be soaked in republicans blood is electrocuting his dog... what a shocker!
You guys, he's just telling Kaya to use thunder bolt.
Muslims being Muslims
Can't say I'm shocked.... Too soon?
Put the thing on him as soon as he tries to say something, continuous fire!!!
"But it's called an educator"
And their just gonna double down that dogs are evil-
I like how they have an excuse for EVERYTHING?   If he is doing nothing wrong, what was that dew claw stuff all about?
Please P.E.T.A help this poor dog.
Hassan is the epitome of a spoiled rich kid with influential connections. He's also the epitome of a c**t.
Hello? Mr. Wick? Yes, it's happening again.
I have always thought Hasan as a not so intelligent person just from listening to him speak. Glad to see that proven to be true
Now we know why Will Neff was so quite on their Podcast
The part that's stupid is his lying, idc if he uses a shock collar and nor should anyone else but the lies is pathetic.
I already disliked Hasan as a person. Now I hate him as one hates the ant that bites them on a picnic... Fuck this guy
God will make your enemies your footstool!
Free Kaya
shock collars when USED PROPERLY are great tools for training very difficult dogs. what he does is abuse animals who fail to behave absolutely flawlessly; like a stuffed animal, that just happens to be alive.
All he had to do was claim ignorance, not knowing it was commonly considered abuse, or that he used a low voltage and it got mistakenly turned up for that instance, or ANYTHING but the constant lies about it. All that did was prove he considered it just as wrong as so many others and did it anyway. Disgusting cretin and so many worship him.
Ladies and gentlemen. We got him
The retards are retarding again....
Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid.
Imagine you cannot able to control your own life so you just forcefully control other life in this case his poor dog. :(
said all that wild stuff and hurting his dog is what's gonna take him down
Poor dog.  😢😢
I send 1 ⚡ emoji on the stream and the mods banned me, a democratic place after all.
Dude even eats an entire baked good to try to disguise his movements
The truth always has its day. For liars, that's a lot of days.
so he's Thor. both wielding lightning, and unable to admit his mistakes.  Two Thor's in one
Why is a Muslim setting up Christmas decorations?
hasan is a dumbass and a piece of shit human being
All his fans are saying its a zyn container 😂
1:20 Him and Pirate Software have that in common
I hope this gets him banned. I hate people who abuse animals.
Horrid people. The lot of them. Hope that dog finds a better home.
Why are we focusing on on shock collars, there’s a genocide going on. Guys…guys.!!!! Please ignore it
He's so cooked. Thats 100% the shocker remote shown in a video. Proven now. This fool just needs to admit it, shocking is bad enough but to then lie about just shows you he knows he shocks the dog for no reason and its abuse. If he was using it just for training you'd just say "yeah I use a shock collar for training." And it wouldn't be a big deal.
What a  scumbag, that poor dog needs to be rescued from him.
Caught in 4K....4k times.
Why is he putting up Christmas decorations?
dudes a liar, narcasistic, dog shocking, douche  never watched a single video of his and my gut told me what he now confirms....
Honestly Hassan went about it the best way for himself. Now, even with all this evidence, his fan base will say it wasn’t a shock collar even when shown definitive proof to the contrary. So likely nothing will come of this controversy and everyone will forget about it in 2 weeks
This mf has his back covered, I cant tell you who it is, but trust me he wont go down, even his uncle got some officers attacked after lyinh on tyt and you know what happened, absolutely nothing, then he blamed the right wing for it
The truth will always catch up to a compulsive liar. They cannot keep their guard up forever.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him
It's kind of telling when you have one guy who admits he's wrong versus one guy who wont.
Leftists are sociopaths or Psychopaths or dumb or  just evil
why is a muzzie celebrating christmas?
Poor dog mange
It’s actually over x47
He's a bitch that's why he can't own what he's doing to the dog, man up hassan just making it worse, what a dumbass lol
I think he’s doing this crap for attention he knows no one cares or talks about him unless there’s stupid drama
This is shocking!
No food, no water, no exercise, no enrichment, no bathroom breaks, and a shock if she stretches her legs. I guess Hasan can't stop abusing his dog as long as one Jew remains, right, Hasan fans?
Just a scumbag
Animals follow animal abusers. Chodes.
The guy is finished, he's done for! What a piece of shit he is, disgusting.
" Its Ai" this guy most likely
Hasan can’t melt steel beams
People who have personality traits like this Has guy, are obvious to people who don't put up with other people's bs. This guy is a tool, a liar, manipulator, violent and hateful speech, cares about social media to the point of unhealthy and unstable.
Hasan is a grifter at best
0:20 This is dsp realise he just beat his meat on stream.
cowards never admit when they are wrong.... he should be forced to wear it for a day and let his chat activate it whenever he does not do what they want.
3000
Remember everyone if there's a smoke, there's always gonna be fire.
There are certain types of kennels for guys like him ..
LMAO Now not only is he a proven psycopath that shocks his dog for literally taking a step off the box, he's also a lying c*nt that pretends that he never shocked his dog in the first place!  But we already knew all that.  Ahahahaha.   I mean what are the chances that a mega hypocrit millionaire that lives in a mansion from his capitalism-supported gains while preaching socialism and hate against America was going to be an honest person who treats his dog with love and respect?  LMAO
Next time twitch recommends his channel to me on their website, I plan on speed running getting banned. I will comment on another video to let you know how long it takes and how it goes.
let's see what excuse they use now. Oh No!1!1 Someone broke into his house, but only placed that there and they were also a trump supporter, btw.
I don't doubt that Hasan feels some type of love for the dog Kaya. But a narcissistic spoiled brat like him won't be able to treat Kaya with the love that dogs need. They're just not compatible.
He's such a disgusting little weasel.
The definition of a Christian is ‘A believer of the Lord Jesus Christ’, that’s it. Religious people are NOT Christians, they’re Pharisees, works-salvation heretics. So-called Christians believe in a False Jesus who didn’t pay for sins, who failed as a savior and can lose his sheep. Salvation is a free gift, it’s not by works. You DON’T have to change your life, you DON’T have to stop fornicating, lusting, smoking, drinking, none of that saves you. God is willing to accept you as you are, no matter what you’ve done or doing. You receive salvation the second you believe that Jesus paid it all and is able to save you. Once that happens, God imputes His righteousness on you and seals you with the Holy Spirit until the Day of Redemption. This is what it means to be ‘born again’ and this cannot be reversed, nullified, or undone. Trust Jesus, the Son of God and his DEATH, HIS BURIAL, AND HIS RESURRECTION. That's the true Gospel.
So are we gonna get him arrestested for inciting violence against republicans in graphic detail and also abusing his dog or what?
Classic Streisand lmao
Dude Has people setting up his Christmas tree for him? This guy is nothing but fake. How people can't see that is crazy. To follow a straight loser is ridiculous. You guys need to follow some sport athletes or something.Actually they're terrible too.
Muslims and dogs...
At this point he's probably doing it on purpose, there's no way you're that sloppy with it. He knows for sure that he's not ever facing any consequences because the die hard fans will eat out whatever excuse he decides to run with that day, and Twitch itself would never do anything against him because he's Dan Clancy's golden boy, so this is just generating more engagement for him.
Muslims cant have dogs as pets only as workers. Hasan is ragebaiting us because he actually harbors no feelings towards his dog besides annoyance and contempt. That poor dog is his slave so people acutally watch him. Hes playing us all for fools because if people find out that muslims treat dogs like crap then everybody hates him as they are doing now. If hasan was such a nice guy why would he have to hide part of his religion to get people to like him?
Some how this hasan guy has spent so much time indoors,  that life has not corrected his disposition and overall behavior.
Moving it made it x1000 worse than of he'd simply not acknowledged it
It feels like he's pushing the limits to see how bad he can be before getting arrested.
I am somehow reminded of the downfall of PirateSoftware. Started off small, then it avalanched as more and more clips surfaced.
Hasan breaths- another try to cancel him, they’ll try again next month and fail

Son of a b!tch
For leftists, every accusation is an admission of guilt. They merely accuse their enemies of that which they are already doing.
Its all funny and stuff, but I feel bad for the dog
abusing dogz.  It will cost him a lot.
And they'll keep trying to defend him.
Idubbbz chose this guy as a friend.
Calls for Republican Senators to be shot, says America deserved 9-11, says Capitalists blood should run red in the streets. Gets taken down because he tortures his dog.
I literally F-ing owned that same freaking collar and remote 100000% case closed, i don't need to see anything else.
Those dumb hore streamers are gonna be banning everyone in chat calling their 60 IQ asses out.
Put the shock collar on Hasan and stream him being shocked for 8 hours.
Hasan is fucking scum
People don't snitch on liars, they always snitch on themselves.
This is what hapoens when a person thinks he is smarter than anyone else. And his hubris of trying to prove he loves his dog with 4 camers brings him down.  He looked at the camer as if his uncle found the piss drawer.
The worst part about this whole drama is that poor dog is probably being treated even worse off camera now than it was before the drama... You know it makes him mad....
Are we sure hes not actually jewish?
THIS IS REAL COMMUNISM BEING TRIED. Imagine this guy being in charge of a commune.
I’m wondering how the most protected streamer is going to evade this one now
What a nazi.
bro i just know it already
Hey can someone Charlie K this guy already
It's so incredibly funny that people were defending this dude like simps.
Him staring at the camera after slyly moving the remote should be on a  shirt.
Hasan big face-ass nega!
Hes getting rid of the evidence. Act like a criminal all right. If i live near his house i would greet him when hes walking his dog and check her collar and livestream it. Someone please take kaya away from this freak!
>“And Jesus said, "Anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate… is a thief and a robber."” (John 10:1)  Let's look at the “sheep pen” as your inner emotional world and the “gate” as  approaching your emotions directly and with care. Trying to bypass that — suppressing, numbing, invalidating — is like sneaking into the pen as a thief. That’s when emotions get fragmented, scattered, dysregulated, because they’re treated as obstacles rather than signals. This is Jesus (or the emotionally intelligent individual) saying: “Don’t manipulate or gaslight your emotions into silence. Enter through the gate — acknowledge them in a pro-human manner.”  >“The sheep listen to the shepard's voice… he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.” (John 10:3-4)  Emotionally intelligent processing means recognizing your emotions individually — calling them by name. “Loneliness, I see you.” “Fear, I hear you.” “Anger, I want to know more about what you’re protecting.” That’s calling your sheep by name. When you do this, your emotional “flock” begins to trust you more. Your emotions follow your lead because they know you’re listening instead of shoving them into the dark.  >“I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.” (John 10:9)  If “I” here is an emotionally intelligent individual, then the “gate” is pro-human emotional integration. Anyone who chooses this route gets access to “pasture,” meaning: emotional nourishment, more internal understanding, less self-sabotage, a system that works with you instead of against you. By contrast, the “thieves and robbers” are the cultural scripts, suppression patterns, and institutional gaslighting that hijack your emotions for control instead of care.  >“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” (John 10:10)  “The thief” here could be systems, narratives, or internalized scripts that strip you of emotional agency. These are the voices that tell you to “stay positive,” “stop overreacting,” “don’t make it weird.” They steal depth, kill authenticity, and destroy your trust in your own signals. “Life to the full” could mean integrating emotions instead of bypassing them, building connection instead of hiding in performance, seeking meaning rather than numbness.   >“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” (John 10:11)  If your emotions are your sheep, being a good shepherd means you choose to slow down and listen, even when it’s uncomfortable. Laying down your “life” here could mean setting aside ego-driven performance — the curated self that wants to look chill, competent, unbothered.  >“The hired hand is not the shepherd… when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away.” (John 10:12)  The “hired hand” = coping strategies that look like care but abandon you when life gets hard: toxic positivity, spiritual bypassing, numbing with consumption, self-gaslighting (“I shouldn’t feel this”). Those strategies lead towards self-abandonment when the wolf comes — when intense emotional suffering hits — leaving your emotions scattered and unprotected.  >“I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen… they too will listen to my voice.” (John 10:16)  The “other sheep” = parts of yourself you haven’t integrated yet — shadow emotions, buried wounds, forgotten memories. They’re not in the pen yet because you haven’t built safety for them. When you deepen your capacity for emotional literacy, those hidden parts finally come home. That’s the moment where the fragmented flock becomes one — you stop fighting yourself and start guiding yourself.  >“The Pharisees said, ‘He is demon-possessed and raving mad…’” (John 10:20)  This is societal pushback. When you start doing deep emotional work — naming suffering, rejecting shallow scripts, refusing to be gaslit — people might call you crazy, intense, weird because you’re destabilizing the scripts they relied on to avoid discomfort.
To be fair, our first red flag was his name.
Mostly peaceful shock collars
How does Hassan get away with this behaviour.. anybody else would be banned from twitch or even law enforcement... it's a joke!
So does PETA have the proof they need now? Sheesh. The poor dog!
"Pig, dog and KAFIR all the same"  -Sun Tzu
Im watching both asmon and hasan. Even without shock collar, he being mad at a dog just by getting up is insanely crazy
He does not deserve a dog
why does he look like that one Willem Dafoe meme where he's looking up at us LOL
I'm more angry that he's putting up Christmas decorations before Halloween 😡
His name is Hasan...what did you expect?
"That shock control can be used for vibration only, trust me bro" - Probably some Hasan fan.
I never would have expected that Hasan's downfall would be for such an unusual reason lol
Witness that HASAN PIKER IS NOT THE ANTI CHRIST! That's the only reason he even gets away w anything
1:20, and HE calls his dog spoiled...
Hasan defenders in shambles rn
Dog abuse 😢
the internet has the best Detective's lol
Ladies and gentlemen. We gottem.  Also was this a recent stream or no? I can’t tell because of the Christmas stuff being moved around.
So it's 100% confirmed that he's a sociopathic liar now. So anyone still following him is doing so with that in mind.
Do wonder if this will actually lead him to give up his dog  Unfortunately unlikely
cooked
why does mr muslim have christmas decorations
bro why ppl making fun .. it is still the dog who is continously getting abused. as long it is a show to everyone right?
hissan is a child molester
some might say Hasan is the most electrifying man in streaming entertainment.
This is the one thing Hasan didn't want to happen
Let's be honest. As much as this disgusts everyone, nothing is going to happen. The internet has the memory of a goldfish. It'll forget this in a few days and Piker will get nothing.
Hasan, the psychopathic narcissistic liar
He's a libtard, you were expecting the truth? lol...
Wrong guys, this is the remote for Hans Niemann's beeds for the chess world cup .
This guy is so over. I can’t imagine how anyone could still defend him.
Report hamas piker for supporting terrorist and dog abuse shameful piece of shit.........
Ive used a shock collar on my dog for her aggressive behavior around other dogs but I've never used it in the house or even cared where she decided to lay. Why would anyone make a dog stay in a bed for no reason?
really could've avoided it all by admitting it and saying sorry. now he's in trouble for the abuse and the lying
Get detective XQC on this asap
UNLIMITED POWAAAAA⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Hasan is the opposite of george washington lmao  "I cannot tell a truth"
Trump has one of those on Kash
Not only did he lie he changed his story 5 times each time proving he was lying before or after. Usually only toddlers lie this badly.
So let me get this straight. He supports terrorists, and that's okay. But people draw the line at the shock collar?
I’m extremely confused by what’s happening, I could have swore this was discovered and talked about months ago, maybe even last year, how is this being brought up again like no one knew about it when we did know this was happening because everyone was talking about it months  ago.
Guys, he only uses it on his dog’s education days. Relax.
Kaya was just clumsy she walked into a door
This was when Hasan stored his cinnamon flavored Zyns in a shock collar remote container.
Why is this satanic f*kk pretending to celebrate Christmas? *spits
Every dog deserves a home, not every home deserves a dog
You gotta love how the dude started acting like a victim saying crap like, "Well I guess all of my time, hard work and effort spot-training my dog is now wasted, gee thanks! Woe is me!" Meanwhile the poor dog can't even walk around the room without triggering him off apparently, because god forbid she want to leave her little bed to stretch her legs or something.  I wonder what happens when she inevitably has to go pee.
Muslim doing Muslim stuff
But they're Mostly Peaceful Shocks...
THE LOOK UP LMFAO 💀
That Twitch Streamer is guilty, hang'em! We got the rope right here!
Bro is farming hate before congress hearing
The funniest part is he looks 10 times worse for denying it
Wow
4chan to the rescue
I dont think its just the fact he used the collar, its that he LIED about it.
Arabs hate dogs.  An Arab called Hasan, calls dogs slaves, shocks them, uses one as a living prop.  It’s just who they are from the Middle East
"Oh the camera's on? The camera's on the whole time huh? Hello?"
Mostly peaceful shock collar remote
Everybody on the "He's *obviously* shocking his dog" train.  Me on the "How can anybody like this guy when he's *obviously* a habitual liar and childish narcissist? Fake af mf has to lie and fabricate everything he says and does to keep up appearances."  I imagine people who like him do the same.  Going to great lengths to constantly fake who they are in a desperate need for approval.
ladies and gentlemen, we got em.
Hasan deserved 10/7
"i didnt shock my dog" "its not a shock collar"  *Next day* "its a vibration collar" "i was reaching for my zyn"  *A few days after* "Shock collars arent that bad" "they're effective if used right" "everyone thats talking about this is a zionist"   the jig is up hasan, just be honest for once in your damn life lol. the funniest thing is this could have all been resolved if he just showed the collar on day 1 if it WASNT A SHOCK COLLAR.
He needs to admit he lied, come clean and take what others have to say to heart. Consider that how he treats his dog may be wrong and listen to criticism to change for the better. People would appreciate honesty, taking accountability for actions, and then showing new positive change through your actions.
Guys, guys, chill, it's just his remote for his massive vibrating buttplug, that also shocks his taint.
Psycho streamer for psycho audience
Its sure been a year of the snake
That's the remote for the dew claw vibrator.
I don’t get it, ecollars are totally normal and not abusive. Does he just crank it up or something?
The worst thing about all of this is that there will be no real consequences for him again... People will just forget about it again in a month.
Hasan has to be the most embarrassing halfwit to ever consider himself a thinker.
So, the vibration only collars have the same remote. Which makes it even more bad that he didn't immediately just show the collar that Kaya was wearing on Dogtober 7th to dispel any doubt. No way it's not a shock collar. He wouldn't have awkwardly hid the remote if it was just vibration collar either.
LMAO 😂😂😂
Mostly Peaceful Electrocutions
No one will care enough to actually stop giving Hasan a career tho
Hasan has gotta be lobotomized. There's no way he's this braindead naturally
nha, fuck that dude. i just delete him from my mind, he is shit and always be shit
For once PETA might be useful.
why did bossmanjack have to get arrested instead of this asshole :( at least bossmancrack is entertaining.
let's see how the Hasan pleb defend this one LMAO
Like Macron grabbing the bag in the Restaurant
ok literally how the FUCK can you still defend this guy...
This is just his remote controlled butt plug that he always wears guys relax
caught 4k!
Fukkin idiot. bro even looked at the camera above 😂
How is a muslim terrorist supporter torturing dogs even news? Isn't this just normal behavior for those people? He probably only owns the dog so he can electrocute it.
The CollarGate! The CollarGate is real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
N is for narcissist
Extensive psychological research, including studies linking animal cruelty with personality disorders, aggression, and a broader pattern of antisocial behavior, supports the idea that people who harm animals have severe psychological disturbances. The FBI considers a history of animal cruelty to be one of the warning signs for serial rapists and murderers. Research has linked animal cruelty to several significant mental and behavioral issues. Just sayin...
Who cares whether or not he zapped or buzzed the dog? I know plenty of dogs and some got it coming
Pls someone help this poor dog😢 Really feeling bad for him
Karen's reported on a squirrel. Where are they now?
Poor dog
At this point I have a crackhead theory Hasan is setting himself up on purpose to engagement farm. I mean, there’s no way somebody is ACTUALLY this stupid… right?
hasan = pirate = bad streamer with a lot of money from family if anything happens to asmon we know whose family did it.
1:18 he accidentally perfectly descripes 2 streamers 100% Jason Hall (piratesoftware) and Hasan Doğan Piker (HasanAbi) in one sentence. that was a great one.
At this point hasan should just come clean and be genuine.
and people will still watch and send this garbage money! Yall should be ashamed if you still support these people
The Hasan d riders will gaslight us all and say we're schizos for seeing that.
Trump--they are shocking the dogs! big shock nice shocks but wrong shocks.
Who cares.
He should wear the collar
The dog isn’t the only prop. His entire ideology is a prop.
Excellent investigative work by the community. This proves what we all already knew, Hasan is POS
It's so satisfying to see the moral high ground snatched from his fanbase and have them as the ones having to pleas their innocence, rather than being the ones weaponizing morality to bully others into a corner
Goteem!
THEY FUCKING FOUND IT!
More fking garbage content.
Yeah fuck hasan thanks fuck
Someone PLEASE take that dog from him. You KNOW he does that shit for fun..this shit is killing me💔
To be fair that is the exact same remote for the PG-302 which is the vibrating only version. Though I must say the collar he shows on stream is completely different than that brands ONLY pager. The charing port is the dead give away. The metal screws can be removed if you open up the main block. But that charging port for the pager is vertical on the side and not horizontal. Also the pager version is much skinnier than the shock collar
Either he's a complete idiot or playing the longest game ever in which he is doing this shit on purpose and for fun to see how much shit he can get away with
Maybe we should put a shock collar on hasan
At this point hasan should just come clean and be genuine.
So is there going to be any actual punishment or is everyone going to talk about it for 2 weeks and move on to another topic...
Lol, got him in 4k
people are mad that he has a vibrating collar on his dog?  Seriously?
Huh... so that's why I got hit with the E-E-E-E ET homed phone with a mix of urinal cake cologne, is it a stanza or Stallone stand alone.  Yeah yah yah yeet
Its literally illegal to use those in most of the world. Including many US states.
"Mostly Peaceful Shock Collar"
Ladies and gentleman, WE GOT HIM!
"Im shocked" -Kaya
Mossad is electrocuting his dog
Karma, God, and the devil itself just trying to show us how bad this dude is 😂
Fawk that guy for using and hurting that adorable dog like that, heartless piece of shit!! He won't be a man and properly train it so instead he tortures it MF!
Mostly peaceful shock collar.
He should put the collar on himself.
So what do his dick eaters want to use as an argument THIS time?
The fact that he's clearly self-conscious about it indicates he knows it's wrong.
It's okay guys, he wouldn't care if it was happening to him!
He’s the definition of why we don’t deserve dogs
Now, I know it's not long after someone genuinely important had just been perma'd simply for speaking his opinions and trying to open dialogue... ...But if someone perma'd Hasan Piker, would anyone really genuinely be upset? You probably shouldn't do it to begin with, I wouldn't do it, because I don't want to get caught and I'd almost immediately get caught, but if someone in general did that would anyone really be devastated by that? And don't say "his fans would be" because they're not real to begin with lol.
How the offlinetv simps gonna stick up for hassan now?
Why not just let dog walk around? Does there really have to be two bitches on camera all the time?
First he deny it, then admit it, then use those fckass camera angle, now this. Certified tard
Got Yah....
Hasan is like boogie2988.  Gaslighting and changes the narrative from one sentence to another.  Dude is a stinky loser
If the collar fits...
Stalinesque.
The fact Hasan has so many supporters and other content creators trying to back him up and collaborate with him just exposes how utterly void of integrity the “mainstream” twitch crowd are, mizkif, poki so many more… they’re just the fucking worst entitled, bratty and sociopathic  pieces of shit. Actually just shoot them into space where they can jerk each other off far, far away where they can’t drain away my faith in humanity
He's also fighting to justify it. Hasan is such a pig.
The guy whose animals has died in his house from neglect has the audacity to make fun of somebody else.
So the arguments over right? Because it is. He shocks his dog for not being a prop.
"Now it's so over" 🤣
Hassan having a Christmas tree is blasphemy if I've ever seen it
His moron nut gobblers are still gonna defend him.
He’s so cooked 😂
It’s weird how he calls everybody he disagrees with a Nazi/fascist/dictator, yet he never allows his dog to leave his room because he uses it as a prop in the background of his stream and literally shocks it constantly for taking one step off of its bed. Who is the real fascist dictator?
LMFAO!
I really liked this video
He won’t admit he did anything wrong , he won’t admit he lied .. welcome to the democrat , leftist , Marxist mind set .. when caught in a lie they double down and blame _______ ( fill in the blank) and just like Harry Sisson they will continue to spread lies, propaganda and more for $$$ Total scum bags
It's not over until that dog is out of his house. Has anyone tried to get authorities involved or is everyone just using this for content? JFC, this dog needs to be rescued from this psychopath.
Let's see what other "plausible explanations" the fans are gonna came up with.  Though pretty sure it's gonna be another "only psychopath would assume that's a shock collar remote" with a sprinkle of "palestinians are suffering and you guys are worried about this?"
DOG LIVES MATTER!
"ZZZap. Hehehehehe!"
I’m almost beginning to think that hasan is doing this on purpose. Deliberately testing the waters to see how much he can get away with. As well as how much he can gaslight his fans to see how much they will put up with.
That's my remote, I left it at his house. Sorry for the confusion guys.
Please be real and send Hasan to prison please.
Dude should be arrested and banned from Twitch.
As punishment it's only fair that Hassan be fitted with the collar and give the dog the button.
Hasan is such a dog abusing prick.
"Let's hit him with a controlled shock..." - Hassan
Shocking your dog and force him to stay on a tiny little pad just so you can get more clicks and views is psychopath behavior.
The only dog with a pig as owner 🐽... It all happened in plane sight. It's hard to notice if you don't know what to look for..
The mostly vibration collar.
U can’t script this any better 💀
Time to apply a collar to this Turkish trash
As someone who is middle eastern 100% he got beat as a child by his parents those who were always beat always want to exert control over others😂
This is some messed up sheit. Literally animal abuse
Bro even funny painting man hates animal abuse. This guy POS
How are people surprised that HUMAN GARBAGE behave like GARBAGE?
Nothing will happen. We all know it. This guy could beat up his dog right in front of the camera, and twitch would protect him anyway.
If a persons humility was ranked by a number hasans would be negative.
Hasan is a typical Leftist: a deranged sociopath that projects their crimes onto their innocent victims.  The only thing special about Hasan is he's a trust fund baby.
Hasan is a cluster B personality type.
Caught in 4K
its amazing how someone can be this retarded
So now we're going to get to the next stage, which is "Yes it is happening, and it's a good thing"
Psychopath enjoys torturing animals, color me *shocked*
I love the Internet sometimes. It is the most dangerous place. It can finally people THE FBI AND CIA CAN'T. And they come with receipts.😂
"Kaya just got her claw stuck." "It's just a Vibration Collar." "Shock Collars aren't really a big deal" "Shock collars are a necessity and you're stuck in the past if you don't know that." "Here's why my political opponents should be made to wear shock collars."
He look so stupid when he look at the camera 🤡🤡🤡🤣🤣🤣
Mission Accomplished   -George W.
Can't make this shit up
Quick question, why no animal rescue services came for the dog? It’s obvious that it’s being tortured.
I just finished Atozy's video covering this 🤣🤣🤣
What a retard
If right after he got caught, he had just said "Yeah guys its a dog training shock collar. Its something we use to train the dog. I know some people will disagree with it but thats how we're training her, its not torturing her." This probably never wouldve blown up. He'd've caught shit, but like 1000x less than the shit hes catching right now lmao
Anyone who defends Hasan is a domestic or foreign terrorist, prove me wrong.
A mostly peaceful shock.
He doesn't feel bad about what he did, he only feels bad about getting caught. Remember that.
Hasan Haters in the comment, he's just being a good terrorist by having his own hostage! REEE REEE
U know, some ppl r really dumb and never fully think everything through (which is especially hard to keep track of and continue the story when ur lying), and they expose themselves without realizing it or realizing too late. Perfect example of that right here. Great job Hasan. U r so smart. 🙄🤦‍♂️💀
Everyone that had any sense knew it from the very start of this whole thing. Everyone else tried to find him an out. Hasan is a trashcan.
It’s sad that out of all of the horrific shit he’s done, a dog collar is what upset the most people. We don’t deserve society.
That’s his zyn remember!
Oooohh poor kaya😢
We gottem boyz 😂
how is Hasan not banned for animal abuse
Thank you for making videos about this. He’s a monster.
Hasan the next lolcow guys?
I honestly hate those liars because then the moment you say something weird, others will doubt you after being used to liars like this one
Someone rescue that poor animal
Hamas Piker supports terrorists.. and abuses animals
His simps will still defend him.
Ladies and gentlemen, we gotem.
Well, someone on the left can finally claim they don't act like hitler. Good job, I guess.
My dog weighs 5 kilos, I walk him 3 times a day... having a big dog (I asume arround 25 kilos) in that small room forcing him to lay down is criminal.
mais quel bouffon, justice !
Dumbas forgot to think this through 😂
what a scumbag hope he gets a shock when karma comes callin
I have the perfect solution.   I'd be fine with him continuing his career, but everytime hes on stream he has to wear the same spiked shock collar and every donation asmongold gets sends Hasan a shockaroo
you know these "shock" collars have about as much juice as a tens machine, its not like they taze the dog, its like when my cat pees on the floor, i give it a spray with water, air, or give it a flick to "shock" him
This isn't a small thing this is blatant animal abuse
Hasan is no different than Pirate Software. They are an utter narcissists, who's overinflated ego physically prevents then from admitting guilt even if caught red handed.
*The guy is a pure scumbag.*
"Criminals often return to the scene of the crime."
cooked...
No denying it now😂😂
Do as I say not as I do
Kaya got so many shocks she became a Normal/Electric type. And weak to Ground. No wonder shes not allowed to touch it.
And nothing will happen to him even with concrete evidence. 😮‍💨
There's nothing wrong with using shock collars. I use a shock collar to train my dog. The fact that he's lying about it tells me that he's likely abusing it as we've seen in the now infamous clip.
He deserves the exposure.
The average white person in 2025 can watch videos of boys being circumcised (myootilation), videos of abortions and videos of kids being taught lgbt ideology and not bat an eyelid.  But they see 1 dog getting a brief electric shock and lose their minds.  This is unhealthy animal worship.  They care more about lower mammals than their own race or families.  That's mental illness.
he's probably just doing this shit on purpose at this point because it draws more viewers / attention
“Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later that debt is paid” ― Valery Legasov
This ain't the second plane, this is the third plane that hit the pentagon.
Authoritarian Commie fuck
Hasan will never recover from rhis
Dude call everyone disagreeing with him Nazi while keeping his dog like a slave. Cool
And you know his defenders will STILL come up with something to excuse or justify this
Great
To be fair, Hasan really is the perfect representation of what’s wrong with communism. He abuses his power. He’s a tyrant. He’s never wrong. And even if he is wrong, you’re more wrong for pointing it out.
Never admitting fault destroys your credibility.  If you never own your mistakes...when it really counts and when you really were not at fault for something...why would anybody believe you?
Hell do it more and you will like it. Hasans hasan but yall cant do anything to him so who cares?
Lefties have no integrity.  Especially communists.  This isn't surprising.  At all.
Now his uncle has to call Asmon a fascist again
why hasn't  anyone  called animal control or uspca. the blokes a frigin sadist animal abuser..
Hasan benefited from American Capitalism the most.
Another untouchable elite who will get away with it once again smh 🤦‍♂️
The ASPCA: Hey, Sarah McLachlan? Yeah it's us again. Listen uh, you need a quick paycheck in exchange for some TV ad time? Something just came up on the Internet...
Bro. Shock collars are for fetish, not animal control. (I know they have their uses on aggressive animals)
Oops, gotta hide Thor's big ass hammer.
crazy that I still don't know if he will admit it or double down for the 20th time. The people still defending him will still defend him as long as he tells them a lie, or probably even if he doesn't say anything so who knows.
Big surprise. The guy who advocates for death and violence is a lying pos
Comment tribute
VibrateGate
Eu caught himself
Just treating dogs exactly like anyone named Hassan would treat a dog....who was surprised by this? Really? It's like they all come out of one mold.
Evidence is there that proves he's wrong, everyone can see it, he follows a narrative that he created and chooses to believe, tries to convince everyone that he's right and everyone else is wrong. I think I see a pattern here.
He needs to call Cenk to make a video about how shock collar remotes are fascist.
Someone needs to rescue that dog!
Lmao
Why is he still allowed to stream, can’t we call animal services for cruelty or something
i hate both of these people equally
Woooopsie!!!
Don’t worry! Nothing will happen to him, he will still have his platform and still have his cult of followers. Really sad honestly.
sooooo why has no one reported him yet?
He lies about it because he only knows how to lie. His whole life is a lie.
why hassan the muslim have a christmas tree? do muslim celebrate christmas?
After supporting terrorism, twitch now actively supports animal cruelty  Ain't a big step if you think about it...
What a dumb mf 😂😂😂😂😂
Why doesn't he just get a cheap animatronic that looks like a dog, just sits in place and waggles its tail and ears every once in a while?
"Nah this is just a prop remote I use to scare Kaya I swear"
Liars always get exposed. Can’t keep ur story up for too long, and ur camera switch just exposed u. Great job genius! 💀
I love how this guy who said America deserved 9/11 among other things is getting cancelled for animal abuse.
What pisses me off is that his followers still defend him and Palestine.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him.
Gotta love how he conspicuously pushes the remote away before hesitating and trying to act like he was going for a cookie the entire time. That "Oh shit, I'm caught" look right at the camera ain't doing him any favors. xD
EHAT YOU HIDING PIKER
what a retard 🤣
His fan will be like “ yeah he shocked the dog but it ain’t that bad “
I thought as a Muslim and a "Socialist" he'd hate Christmas. lol
Rip cross dresser 😂 what a clown
Hasan deserved 2025 dude. Frick it, I'm saying it.
"guys its not a shock collar, Hasan said so himself!" - some Hasan viewer probably
Cruelty to animals is the only common link between every serial killer
I still want to know how Kristi Noem can shoot her healthy dog and get no jail time for it but instead gets awarded political power. I remember a nfl player of the falcons getting jail time for setting up dog fights. How is that legally possible?
So now, not only is he a dog abuser, but also a liar; he had a chance to come confess, but decided to lie to people's faces. probably had many sleepless nights before being exposed like this.
I hate that pos.
do people actually unironically support him? like on purpose?
That's the tool to cast chidori
That man is evil couldn’t train his dog in nice way
Start a movement to save the dog.
Hasan might have a genuine narcissistic personality disorder. Not just traits but a full blown one. This might categorize him as genuinely insane.
I swear he's going to find a way to blame Asmon for it 😂
He loathes that dog.
Shitbag looked at the camera like a kid that got caught doing shit he shouldn't be doing
Wait, why does this jihadi have a Christmas tree? Haram, bro. Haram.
"Somehow, Palpatine returned."
Hasan "Electric Striker" Piker He tried to slide the conroller out of view and pretend he was interested in the pastries in the box 😂😂😂
I feel sorry for the people that watch HAssans vods to find this.
HE HAD TO HAVE DONE THIS ON PURPOSE THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY THIS MAN IS SO RETARDED🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🕵‍♂️🕵‍♂️🧐🧐
thats a resistance collar against the dog occupying the floor.
It’s actually over… Classic
I am more shocked this idiot celebrats christmas. I would have assumed he saw that as some sort of racists holiday or something dumb.
At this point Cenk's nephew's a lolcow
0:20 The face 😂
ET phone home
How can you be this retarded?
Guys chill out that’s just the remote for his anal-massager
Hasans worst day will happen when the retards in his audience realize hes one of the rich evil people.
So OBVIOUSLY he's still using it...poor dog that's so sad😢
Who would've thunk that Hasan D. Piker would commit an unavoidable crime on the day adjacent to October 8?
Somehow it's always streamers of peace doing these things.
U know why is it the communist who do this lol
Hasan’s address is known. We can call the police on him. Especially now.
so if thor can get canceled for his stuff, this should be enough to get this dude GONE
That's literally the remote, and the fact he slid this one specific thing neatly out of frame and then looked sheepishly at the camera only seals the deal. Anyone still supporting this animal abusing retard is just as bad as he is. I hope he gets perma banned from Twitch, Twitter, Kick, Rumble, YouTube, all of it, get this guy off the fucking internet it's gone on long enough, he's a pro-terrorist, anti-American, frequently-making-calls-for-violence, dog-abusing asshole.
body language is everything when it comes to doing things you arent supposed to do  his look at :20 into the soul of the camera tells me that without a doubt in the world now, he 1000% shocked the dog, and multiple times counting all the recently resurfaced clips  someone save that dog
Because he's a coward. I hope he sees this comment. I really do. Can't stand this
Maybe he’s a sociopath because by the way he treats his dog I don’t think he can even feel empathy
Now ask yourself, if he's willing to blatantly lie to this extent, what else is he lying about?
Hasan cosplaying as Raiden?
He's a sociopath
uh-oh .. is this what they call stream sniped ?
Dude, do you have any better video titles than this?
Twitch is gonna deplatform him or not? Animal abuse is against their rules
If this is what ends him, not the terrorist support, glazing, and interviews,  not the constant death threats and doxing, not the calls for violence but using a shock collar which is legal. Wow man
What if I told you, I didnt care? Like if you agree!
Shameless lol
Imagine doing something to prove your innocence just to end up outing yourself tenfold 😅
weaponised autism
HES BEYOND COOKED
It was a red flag when Hasan named the dog Shlomo Rubenstein.
That's it!  This is the definitive, undeniable proof that Hasan is a shady, dishonest person. It's so good to finally get that conclusive puzzle piece I have been wantin.
The dog was trained with fear and not education.
Who knew a pos was a pos
0:20 Dude is dumb as rocks even rocks have more popularity then hasan THE maid leader 💀😂
"Guys, dictatorship is bad but maybe it'd be different if I were incharge?"
dog abuser.
Narcissist at play
GOT EM
Hasan doesn't really think before he acts, does he? I feel so bad for that dog.
I've thankfully never seen a Hasan stream, but he seems like one of the most insufferable kunts ever
As a said. The point its not if he uses shock collars or not, its how he do it, not only the collar but how he threatens the dog to be on the same spot for hours(4,6,8) without even allowing it to get up to pee, stretch, poop, drink water, eat etc. this guys is disgusting and is clearly using his dog to get views. Diabolical behavior
Somebody needs to just kidnap that  pup. Just imagine him running free !
He just does it to himself that’s the insane part
Vlad the impaler had the right idea about turks.
That's the kinda things narcissists do when nobody is watching
1:05 *To the tune of Jeff Goldblum from Jurassic Park* "Well, there it is."
Feeling very bad for the abused dog. She deserves a better home.
Doesnt look the same at the bottom
You can now pinpoint the exact time and place a man was cancelled.
Honestly guys, who gives a fuck if he zaps his dog? I literally hate this dude and he’s a coward for not just admitting it. I have two pitbulls and they rambunctious as shit, sometimes you gotta give em a lil zap! No biggie. If you hate him that’s fine, but he’s done way worse than zap a dog that he owns.
What a fucking scumbag. I held my conviction just to leave it some doubt, but all the new clips leave ZERO. On top of his actions he blatantly LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING. Rot in hell you commie.
Remember though calling him out for his abuse is Islamaphobia even Sasha Grey says so 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ I use to like her but being a native Californian she like the rest of the state is DEEP in TDS.
Why would Israel do this?
Good lord. It's in THE spot, he moves it so its out of frame, covers his hand being there by grabbing a cookie, and then LOOKS UP AT THE CAMERA with an expression of worry that screams "Hope nobody noticed that". You can't script this crap.
We now get to the "It is happening and why it's good actually" part.
Can we get some o7’s in the comments for the true American hero who sat through several hours of footage for this?
What a monster
You can clearly see the dog twitching, poor dog n sick mf
He never admits when hes wrong. uh oh pirate software all over again😅
smooth
It's been established.  He's a bad person, doing bad things.  Twitch is the problem at this point.
Hasan the electrocutioner abi
Yn as a leftist I’ve always hated Hassan good to know my thoughts were never unfounded ( they weren’t already )
Even now, his mob will support him and try to convince themselves and others that this is not a shock collar. What a shock!
everyone would have forgot about this in a week if he just said he uses a shock collar. youd get the usual comments about how much of a POS he is and how he should get banned, then nothing will happen and everyone will carry on with their lives
I'm not convinced that's what that thing is. That could be the key fob for his car alarm for all I know.
Crazy out of all the insane thing he’s done this is wear people draw the line. lol
Ban shock collars
Don't worry guys, it's a Zionist dog
And yet, watch as Hasan's Orbiters and Cult Members bend over backwards 5 times in rapid succession to defend this and explain how even though its exactly what it looks like, it's actually the fault of the "Far Right" and is Germany in 1942 Propaganda
Please save DOG.
Thats what he wants for anybody that disagrees with his politics.
The fact he continues to lie about it after being exposed over and over. He's a vile narcissist
Just blame the jews
Parents should definitely be proud…. 🙄🙄🙄
Dog trainer here, do be clear, using E-Collars is NOT unethical. Of course I don't know how he is using it but just putting that out there. I've used E-Collars to train my dog and many clients dogs, and if used correctly, they are a useful dog training tool. Sorry to crush your souls.
The thing is you have to remeber his fans don’t care.  Remeber there are literal cults (Islam) that believe in having intercourse with children and commiting genocide to non Muslims.   As well as leftists that support communism and death to free speech. You think they will care if this guy hurts dogs? Cmon now people
what a fucking POS
You don't hide something if you think you've done nothing wrong.
I wish your pops was still around to witness this, he would love it.
I don’t get it. If it’s illegal then why is it commercially sold?
Why does a 'Muslim' have a Christmas tree?
We need proof of life atp. Hate to be the one who says it but Hassan is unhinged.
This isn't enough for his fans still somehow. They're saying it could be anything and means nothing.
Cut billions of fskins off of baby boys screaming in agony and nobody bats an eyelid.   Give a dog a brief mild electric shock and everybody loses their minds.
What happen with his Snapchat logo that he always has on a stream what did his account get banned for sending d pics to 12yo
He'll never admit anything. Disgusting liar.
animal abuse
Fucking idiot exposes himself 😂
His fans will excuse, ignore and justify anything and everything he does. They are a cult and he is their weird goofy ass little cult leader. I mean at least manson got you drugs and pussy in his cult, all Hasan gets you is a lawsuit and put on multiple government lists you don't want to be on.
Why would he admit to anything if he can get away with it? Hell, he could beat Kaya and probably a human to death with a baseball bat and I am like 80% sure he would get away with it. And Twitch would suck his cock even if he turned out to be a pdf:file and did the deed live.
"Go right. Enhance. Give me a hard copy there."
Meanwhile people somehow believe it was disproven
This is so comically stupid that I can't help but think that he's doing it on purpose at this point and everyone is in on it to farm views and clicks.
Can you even imagine how dumb these jackasses tryna defend it lol
yep, he's done
Watch valkyrae not say anything to backstab a dog abuser but she’ll backstab someone trying to help her 😂😂
Of all the heinous things he has said or committed, the Dogtober 7th was the one  he is now famous for. How ironic lmao.
Of course Twitch won't ban him for performing live animal torture
An animal abuser and terrorist lover. What a guy...
If he put it up his ass and let his stream control the voltage and frequency he could totally redeem himself
How his delusional chat going to defend him now probably make another excuse like oh that's just something else
His name is now ShockSan! Never refer to him by his other name again.
Finally he is cooked. Im glad. If stupid people think they are smart.... Hmmm no they not. And it is sad that others felt that he is...
Israel shocked his dog and put the remote there
And why hasn't anything been done yet? Is it actually over?
can we all agree Hasan uses Palestine as a tool for his contents and wealth? Bro, i can even imagine someone points a gun at him and shoot and he use a Palestinian as a shield and somehow can still say "YOU SHOT A PALESTINIAN YOU PRO ACTIVIST!!" bruh
Bro would rather have a shock collar on his dog than actually train his dog probably. The young learn faster and more easily than the adults.  Teach your animals or even kids how to behave as young as possible. That way they will behave when they grow up and they don't have to learn something completely different than what they grew up knowing and following. It's so fucking simple.
jodido psycho, me sorprende que aun no le quiten el perro.
Its clear as day now, it's a chock collar, so lets  send this clip to the moderating team on Twitch and watch them take absolutely zero actions.  🐍 + 🐍 = ♥️
Why do people like this guy so much???  Idc about politics but torturing dogs crossed the line for me. This guy can't be getting away with this.
That just my but plug remote I swear
He did it. Sue me. Let's get to discovery.
Save Kaya 😢
It was never even debatable before all this other evidence LOL
He is pathetic.  We all know it.  but will there be consequences? probably not
Dude's a pos
What an absolute scumbag.  Hamas Software over here.
"he doesn't admit to anything he does that's wrong."  So you mean he's a narcissist? Yeah I think we all knew that already.
Omg, nobody said its the shocker for the dog, its the shocker for the lady to cook him food, omg
Oh he’s so fucked XD
1:04 that drama cymbals ICANT
What a dumb so called human
Generally, the people who are the most vocal about telling you how to think (Hasan), are the people who are abusive, to people, animals, w/e. they're trying to mold people to believe whatever they say so when their crimes come out people will disregard it as propaganda. The sad part is, it's worked to a degree with him, even tho the guy is a vile example of human trash.
Asmon already showed it was a shock choler, and the pins were taped, now it's just farming
why cant someone just put him into a coma already?
Reminder: You don't hate Hasan enough.
There is no defense. There IS NO DEFENSE.
Let any man talk long enough and eventually he will hang himself with his own words.
its a canon event that hassan's downfall would be like this
What a fkin liar
To the shock of nobody, he was guilty
Shock or not, he trains his dog to be still for hours on end. Dogs are meant to be active
Ladies and Gents.  We got em
It keeps getting worse 😭
“No, I don’t use a shock collar. Here’s the brand, model, amd serial number. And here are some clear, close up images.”  OR  “Yes, I use a shock collar as recommended by my dog trainer.”  Say either one of these on days 1 or 2 and it would have all gone away.  The cover up is funnier than the actual crime. It’s so funny. Keep digging. 😅😅
bruh its obviously electro shock therapy, the dog came forward and admitted it was depressed and this treatment was put forward by Dr. Dolittle, its clinically proven to train the dog to be happy. Hes helping the stage prop.... i mean doggo :/
86HP
Watch as he gets away with it yet again.
One again CANCEL HIMMMMMM!!!!
There's nothing wrong in and of itself with shock collars- they keep dogs from running into roads and tame aggression or bad toilet behavior -but why would he use it for the dog in his room? Is the dog being potty trained? What's the point of putting a shock collar on a dog in a closed bedroom if the dog isn't peeing everywhere or chewing stuff up?  I saw a four hour time lapse of the dog laying there for four hours, literally doing nothing wrong. Shouldn't that be proof that the dog's collar is no longer necessary?
I can't help but notice the christmas tree in the background. Hasan claims to be a muslim and culturally turkish, yet celebrates a christian holiday through a culturally western lens.
He doesn't admit it, because he needs to pretend he's NOT a radical Muslim who hates western values. He has to pretend he believes in animal rights. When in reality he's more at home in the violent barbaric Islamic middle east.
Dude, please for the love of dogs, interview Joel Beckman @BDTraining   Not only is he considered the best dog trainer in the world, he advocated against shock collars. There is a reason why they fail, but, there is also a reason why in some situations they are beficial, especially in working dogs (vibration, not shock). But for 99% of us in the world, they suck and they screw up dogs because owners don't understand what they do to a dog.
Typical terrorist democrat.
Ladies and gentlemen. We got ‘em.
He needs to be arrest
The way he uses this poor animal as a prop for his streams is gross.
Who would've thought the terrorist loving communist was a bad person?
Justice for the dog
His caught with his pants down!
Who cares there's a genocide
Quit shocking your dog. Weirdo.
I love the Streisand Effect
The Israelis invented the remote, obviously. There's a genocide, you know. Wait, what? There's a peace deal? And it's because of Trump? Libs are having a ruff week....🐕
Don’t worry it’s just the button for his vibrating anal plug.
I just need to see the hasan fans now
Not only is he a lying sack of abusive crap. He's a STUPID lying abusive piece of crap...... who'd of thought?? Throw the troglodyte UNDER the jail at this point!
Absolutely caught his psycho ass in that clip 😂
1 point on a graph is just a point, 2 points makes a line,  but still 3 points is "you're a dumb fuck, we know you be lying up and down till the cows come home"
We finally got him guys   Minor slap on the wrist incoming🔥🔥🔥
Ladies & Gentlemen,  We Got Him.
Got eeeem!
Hasan's having a real  "Uh oh!"  "UH OH!!" moment huh?
all comes down hassan being rich and privilegedhis whole life
1:04 You can see the white text that says ET-300, even though the resolution isn’t high enough to read it 😂
So that's a different model. Did this one not deliver a satisfactory amount of pain?
From the couch to the TV, Kaya will be free!
also note thats where he keeps it. and in all the videos its where he reaches over. are we at "ok i might of did it, but shock collars arnt that bad." i love how he cant lie out of this one. no amount of deflecting is changing the facts. hasan shocks dog for streching his legs (its been a fun week)
Good ol Terrorist sympathizer Hasan.
there is an even worse clip of hasan putting kaya together with his other dog and being fine with, even encouraging that it attacks kaya
People actually use those things? ON THEIR DOGS???!!! WTF. How is this even a thing? Oh wait, humans... fucking assholes.
SOMEONE GET ME IN A FIGHTING RING WITH HASANABITCH.
Are you saying he lied to his devoted followers? Even the feminists?
Nah, it's just the remote for Hasan's vibrating butt plug.
As someone who had a career operating surveillance systems and using the footage to prosecute people, I had a motto that I taught to people learning how to investigate cctv footage.  "Guilty people, look up."  I explained that if you are looking through footage quickly, whenever you see someone look up at cameras, stop there.  Look before and after, and you will find why they look guilty.
holy shit, this is amazing
Imagine he accidentally Pressed it when he moved it and the dog yelped again 😭
He cant admit it its illegal in his state
If they get into power, expect more of this. Never let them win.
I love how everything falls into place.
Cooked lol
These libtards all have absolutely no problem lying directly to your face as long as it benefits them.
His dog is literally in an open-air prison.
If you cant train a dog you shouldnt have one!
Someone CALL FOR REMOVE THE DOG FROM HIM,DAMMIT.
W editor as always for using the witcher 3 music
Twitch: the Streamer of the year is - Hasan Hit Ler
nothing unites people like animal cruelty
Bruh this guy is really gonna fall by his freaking dog and not because his stupid ass opinions or open support to terrorists and violence
Electric but mostly peaceful collar
This guy is the definition of zero accountability
bury this terrorist
Can he just solve this whole thing by hiring a caretaker? Fucking hire one of the orbiters to take care of the dog and get rid of the collar except for walks if you can't manage your dog.
"wake up babe, new Hasan angle just dropped"
Abusing a helpless dog shows Hasan is truly filth and disgusting trash.
This reminds me of the meme of a person riding a bike and than putting a stick in the wheel and falling
In Romania we have in rural areas still alot of that WC that is in the back of the yard with a hole in the ground and a small sort of wood construction over the hole .....it is called Hazna this guy deserve the name HAZNAN
I'LL FUCK HIM UP. FOR KAYA
He’s a narcissist. He can’t be wrong about anything ever. If you think he’s wrong, you’re an idiot. That’s how his brain works.
If he admitted it - this would have gone nowhere...
To quote Morgan Freeman. You "fucked up",
He's gonna say it's AI
My favorite part of all of this is how Pokimane reveals herself to be the exact same type of person as her viewers, as she herself is to Hasasn what her viewers are to her.
Free Kaya from Palpatine
Communists:  >invents gulags >starves millions of their own citizens to death but people are surprised one electrocutes a dog?
I thought there was evidence of animal abuse? Is this not the full clip?
Listen, mossad clearly put the controls for a shock collar there to discredit hassan - hassan orbiters probably
Don't worry guys, it's out of context...
id love to see what maya thinks about this
Is this more recent?!? Was the dog he held hostage, I mean “place trained”, just replaced with decorations?!?
So many it's over videos yet nothing is ever over since these videos keep coming
Strip everything they are away from them:  Hasan Vs. Asmon. Just based on "Compulsive Liar" that Hasan is and "Actually woke" Asmongold - I'll take Asmon every day >.> Hasan's Type is fucking evil and can't be trusted. This the type of Man to rape people and lie about it / swear it on his mother's life.. Asomon is what "woke" actually is >.> dude is inexplicitly introspective and honest. Sucks it takes hours and hours to understand that, but it only takes seconds to spot "a Hasan" :T they out themselves constantly - and you people pretend you can't see it. Talks like a sociopath with forced intonation often. Talks down to everyone in person, which gets worse with calculated aggression / whining.. A lot of people with this level of apathy and ego issues do weird ass crime like sell drugs, rob people, or are just generally predators.
its not over , he will keep doing this and nothing will happen to him, wtf we doing here ?? theres no way people are THIS STUPID to not understand they're all in on it, try going live on twitch and do this and see what happens, even asmongold is in on it, they making money through their "beef" and u just consume their fake ass shiet without a second thought, fuck our world is do fucking fucked if u cant see how this is not normal
Bro is just rage baiting us with animal abuse 😭😭😭
A jury would be saying guilty by now
Undercover Mossad agent Kaya just doing her duty for the love of her people
SOMEONE PUT ME IN A FIGHTING RING WITH THIS PIECE OF SHIT AND ILL DO THE REST. MONEY WILL GO TOWARDS ME BUILDING A FARM FOR ALL ANIMALS.
Hope Kaya will find a loving home when Hasan inevitably goes to jail.
Why he still not in jail yet?
I’ve heard multiple times and now that Arabians hate dogs
I've used this model before. It gives you a very wide amount of flexibility in what level you can set it at so it's within your dogs tolerance so they don't jump out of their skin when you correct them. This makes me thing that either Hassan was using it at either a considerably higher level than it needed to be, or he was using the red button which zaps at an increased voltage than what its set to, and is only intended for emergencies (like if your dog is running towards a busy street). There is ZERO reason as to why your dog should be freaking out when you have that model of e-collar. There's no way out for him on this one.
Hasan is going to be behind the next 9/11.
This is nothing compared to genocide of the 😂
This is only a problem if you audience yourself to the world otherwise its a common practice you all eat your own.
You two just need to fk and get it over with
I think it's time some people started making anonymous phone calls to his local authorities to report animal cruelty.  Yes, I know he lives in LA where laws don't exist, but still. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Never wrong? Seems like Narcissism
Such a scum bag. Scum of the earth. That poor dog looks absolutely miserable you can see his tail curling like a captive killer whale free the dog free the dog free the dog
Just pause 00:20 😂😂😂😂
Yall should stop or he'll send the dog to animal control
I honestly can't believe that this is so important to all of you. Ok, the guy is a jerk. Move on.
That's because Hasan is a legitimate narcissist, specifically 'Vulnerable Narcissism'. He openly displays so many of the symptoms:  - A need for excessive validation and admiration (no surprise that he became a streamer...) - Lack of empathy - Highly sensitive of his self-image, and how others perceive him - Projects blame, like how he threw his family under the bus trying to deflect the issue surrounding the shock collar  Narcissists also have a (sometimes excessive) preoccupation with fantasies, in his case crushing capitalism and committing violence against his political opponents. That's also why he'll never do anything to disrupt his fanbase. He's likely to have a fear of abandonment, and having his audience turn on him would be catastrophic.  But most of all, narcissists ABSOLUTELY HATE criticism. Mark my words: keep pushing him about this dog collar issue, and he's going to explode.  "A vulnerable narcissist describes someone who is hypersensitive to rejection and extremely self-conscious. They tend to be insecure, as well. They become angry or offended when not put on a pedestal. A person with vulnerable narcissism is highly sensitive to criticism. People with vulnerable narcissism often lack empathy. If they do show empathy it is used to build their own self-importance."
Why is there Christmas decorations, I thought sand people were against that stuff!
"he never admits his wrong even about anything really small" reminds me of someone lacking mana uh. Guess another head will fall soon enough
We got him, boys! 😂🎉
If it was a vibrator collar why would he want to hide it 😂😂😂
Another plane has hit the tower is hilarious
"ladies and gentlemen, we got him"
The fact that he lied about it an gaslighting not only us but also his own community.
What's the point? People are just going to move on to the next "IT'S SO OVER/ X SITUATION IS CRAZY" slop that's plagued the internet. NOTHING will come of this. Twitch won't do ANYTHING and Hassan will continue to abuse Kaya.
HISSSSAN 🐍🐍🐍
Meanwhile I'm just sitting here wondering why the hell no one has contacted the ASPCA yet?
Dudes a fucking clown
He’s gonna need a bigger shovel for that grave.
how can you mess up this bad
I'm interested how he'll spin this one
Now what does him and his uncle Jägermeister or whatever his  name is have to say?
where's PETA when we need them?
Big yikes
Honestly idk about y'all but cant only be me finding it absolutly hilarious of all things that has been said of all things that he may have said in the future, the one that finally gettin to him is his dog and a simple reaction of stretching the legs or maybe going taking some sips of water. 🤣
“Ladies and gentlemen… we got’em”
bruh just cut his balls off already
@emberparadox458 youre welcome ❤❤
Hasan is piece of SHIt!! Human garbage. Muslim scumm same as his uncle. 2 retards
version 1: Kaya just stubbed her toe.  version 2: It's just a Vibration Collar.  version 3: Shock Collars aren't that bad.
Free kaya
The way he looks up at the camera. 😂 He's so guilty.
A particularly derogatory Aussie ism is piker ..... it means coward ....
I was given one liek it by my dog trainer its a great tool but not to make the dog sit in one place hours on end crazy.
Remember, if he's not banned on Twitch, Twitch by default supports animal cruelty.
And this is the moment Hamas Piker became the Bay Harbor Booty Shocker, "It's over, he knows"
Where are all the activists now? Where are all the SJWs now? Because it's been one week and this AH has not been canceled, punished, or anything. We live in a hypocritical society (world) for sure. If I were any "conservative" or person against the agenda, this person would be canceled in hours, even K as Charlie. I'm sick of this BS what is wrong is wrong, doesn't matter who, the color, sex, or age. Wrong is wrong. Why wasn't Hassan banned? Why is the internet taking this just as a bad joke? This unilateral standard must stop.
Dude that isn't even like a regular training collar you would buy... that shit actually looks like something that would make the animal really hurt... no wonder the poor dog screamed in pain in that last video..
Put the whole dog shock collar thing aside, who the hell sets up a Christmas tree this early! Fucking psycho!
I feel sorry for what that dog goes through on a daily basis
Let’s wait for the gymnastics Nadia Comaneci style
Hasan is going to hell after he dies and it's just going to be him being kept in 'place' for eternity with a perma shock collar around his neck
How come no ones kicked his ass for this yet
How are people finding these clips???
Why is he setting up for Christmas? It's haram!
I thought shock collars are typically only used to manage agressive behavior in certain breeds of potentially violent dogs. This big, sweet, ball of dog is certainly not that.   It just really seems cruel, even for a jihad apologist.
That was clearly what he is doing. I'm not sure why anyone would give him the benefit of the doubt. The dog jumped then yelped loudly and immediately got into "position" laying down like a hood ornament..
Who else is shocked at this point beside the dog?
its not even Halloween yet. wtf is that tard doing putting up a tree already
I'm with hasan, the shock prongs were obviously already removed from that collar and have been placed carefully and lovingly on either side of his scrotum, this is what the remote is for.
Jigsaw put PirateSoftware and Hassan in a closed room with poison gas. The escape door only opened if any of them said "I'm sorry, I was wrong". They both died inside the room.
I mean, we all knew what it was. Just sad he tries to hide it.
Twitch might not perma ban him it’s clear that  Clancy s “Chosen One”s divinity is slowly but noticeably slipping away… :)
All he has to do is wait a month for the internet to lose interest and move on, but he alone is keeping this in the lime light. Just get the collar and remote you utter baffoon
The USA law must take actions against anyone that harms animals. We must hold Hassan accountable for animal abuse.
Now we know what they are meant to say when they said "You guys are lack of EDUCATION" .
Of all the reasons to hate this piece of filth, I never thought the list would include putting up a Christmas tree in fucking October.  That's just pure sociopath behavior.
Cooked!!!
Some get this to Pegasus immediately
There's a group of turkish dudes dancing rn
Its my diet coke button, i swear - Hassan
F's in the chat
If you notice, Kaya is cozying up to  someone rather than Hassan
Love how he is just outing himself more and more with every clip. The stupidity of the repulsive is our saving grace
Look, why are we worried about this when there's a genocide. Guys, can we all just drop this and focus on something else. Thank you.
See. It doesn’t take long for a liar to just screw himself 😂
He can't hide!
Toxic bipartisan streamer yaoi.
Meanwhile, all over social media leftists are still claiming that this isn't true.
I wonder how his fanbase will spin this.
no one on god's green earth can be this fucking dumb. what is wrong Hassan.
It's actually insane to me that Hasan was completely fine for supporting terrorists, hosting an actual teorrost, saying all kinds of outrageous bullcrap. But the world is falling apart because he mistreated his dog
Newsflash. Hasan is a horrible human being. Whoa!
It's funny how dumb all of these pseudo-intellectuals actually are. We see what happens when people like him get into positions of power. All we have to do is look to California, Oregon and NYC. ALL cesspools by every calculable metric.
Solves the riddle!!!
Hasan so stupid dude
I already hate the guy for what he does to his dog but why the fuck is he setting up Christmas shit up in October.
The truth is always laid bare before the internet autists.
well, well, well, the millionaire muslim nepobaby communist caught lying again
He looks like he got caught cheating 😂😂😂
Who does the dog collar belong too? 😮
What a fucking idiot
I don't even know what to say
This feels like the South Park episode where Stan refused to admit he cut his WWJD wrist band
what's crazy is the lengths he has gone to keep his dog in the frame.  at that point its really more than abuse. its malicious. he enjoys the power the remote gives him to control the dog, just like he loves the power he has to ban people from his chat. he's not alone. these type of people are among us every day, everywhere you go. people who felt weak, got power, and ruined themselves over a false sense of superiority due to a mechanical advantage.
Communists are motivated by a sadistic resentment  that makes them act like control freaks. That's why he wants to force his dog to stay on a bed for "hours and hours on end" and shocks him every time he takes a foot off his bed.
Why are people bothering to dig into this further? The first clip was plainly obvious. The dog freakin yelped!
I knew everyone would turn on hasan eventualy, but it being for animal abuse was not in my top 5 guesses ill be honest
Am I the only one who doesn’t give a shit about Hasan and all this boring ass drama?
Just watching all the clowns defending him 🤡
Jews made him do that!
what an actual massive POS. Wtf is so special about Hasan that he is like the goddamn Joe Goldberg of Twitch where plot has everything for him.
So I have looked into this collar and this collar can be used as a vibration only collar, in fact it's even noted that some people tape up the area where the prongs were after removing them to prevent skin contact with the metal areas under where the prongs are to use it as a vibration collar. Now I can't say for sure that this is how Hasan is using this collar but it is possible and that would line up he as stated about how he uses his collar. I think people want to hate Hasan soooo much that they just assume the worse without giving him the benefit of the doubt. What's odd in this case is the only evidence that exists that suggest he is using it to shock her is a single yep from one clip, which could have also been a response to vibration. All the other clips that people found where they think he used the collar she has not yipped. Also I feel like if he had been using a shock collar someone, especially Maya, would have said so. TBH I don't know if he is or isn't using it to shock Kaya.
Mini educator 😂😂😂
Isn't he successful enough of a streamer to hire someone to watch over the dog while he streams?  And after all the publicity he has been getting for this, you'd think he'd put that away.  This has to be a publicity stunt sponsored by the company that sells those shock collars.
_Gigavolt!_
I wonder how many dog abuse complaints his city has received on the behalf of angry people lol
he talks like white male capitalists shock him like he shocks his dog 😂
Hasan ain't beating the allezations
These are the kind people who want you to believe that they would be just, if you finally gave them the form of government they want
Game over Hassan Piker
Well he still has to keep up with Kaya's training. ⚡ 🫨
From the bed to the tree, Kaya will be free
So a lot of people also accused twitch of leaving the bots alone in Hasan's chat which he also denies. Now I'm not saying people should but wouldn't it be funny if someone botted his chat  with the message free Kaya.
lets see PETA defend this lol
"No no no you can't pull out of Poland, Hitler! We saw what you did!" Quote from tom christie
Why is Hamas Piker still trying to hide the fact that he uses a shock collar?  Pretty much everyone except for his community and orbiters who has been following this knows he uses it.
"educator" huh subjugator
How is he not banned on twitch?
Sheeeet, got yoo ass 📸
Why does he even own a dog when he has cat lady views
What's crazy is how many people are denying reality to defend him. Some of them just lie as easily as they breathe all the time, and the rest are willfully blind at least.
Ngl, I want Hamas Piker logged of from reality, he is human trash
FUCK EM UP
What did people expect from a terrorist sympathizer, he probably beats his boyfriend too.😂😂😂
Who woulda thought?!?!
Is that 100% the shock collar remote or does the vibration collar use the same remote? I’d like to be sure because I have a lot of gloating to do.
It's quite astonishing how far his fans are going out of their way to defend him. Well...not that astonishing.
SOMEONE PLEASE rescue that dog!!!!!!
Hasan will come out as gay so people will talk about that instead
Guys he was a dick to his dog. If any of his behavior prior to this wasn't indicative of violent behavior, you missed the plot.
"Got em"
Hes a psychopath that defends terrorists. Is anyone actually surprised that he abuses animals?
Why does he feel the need to “vibrate” his dog every time he feels annoyed with it? He is a multi-millionaire, so I would expect someone to keep his dog for him and have it be free in a controlled space. Dogs are friends, not props
It was obvious from the start, and most of us dont even need to say "told you so" lmao. The man cant stop lying. I wish him the worst.
The vibrating gate comment had me rolling.
It's not over and nothing will happen to him. Dude could murder a kid on stream and get away with it.
Why would he shock his dog on camera though? Like the only thing I can think of is he shocks his dog so much it’s like a reflex which is horrifying.
He’s going to private his VODs at this point.
"Taken out of context, as per usual" 😂
Once a piece of shit always a piece of shit.
Hasan is a sike o pat H
Why hide it if youre innocent
hasan orbiters should use this as an excuse to stay away from him
Folks, it's over, We Got Him!💥😎💥
Arabs lmao
Hassan’s foot should be considered a holy object with how many times he’s shot himself there.
Can this guy just leave the dog alone, like for real wtf
He’s so clueless hahaha
Wonder what excuse he’ll roll out for this one. No matter how absurd, I’m sure his fans will immediately and uncritically accept it as fact.
Kaya... Stay in your bed for hours on end  if you're being held against your will!    I seriously hope that  Someone take that dog Away from him and put her in Am actual living home.
"guys it's actually my remote control for my boyfriend"
Why does he need a shock color if he’s stuck in that tiny cluttered fkin room all of the time.
A cousin of mine has a collar similar to that, but he uses it correctly. He's only ever zapped the dog (big german shepard) maybe twice ever. If he gets too close to the road, he'll push a button and it will beep. That usually makes the dog stop and come back to him or stay nearby. If he still doesn't listen, there is a vibrate feature that does make him remember that he could get shocked. He only ever puts that collar on him if he goes outside and needs to make sure he stays out of the road. But over the last year or two, he doesn't even have to use it. He just calls his dog's name and he comes straight to him. Hassan uses that collar in the worst way possible.
He's an islamist and terrorist sympathizer..dog is haram and He's treating him like that..
The shocks will continue til morale improves The dictator said with alacrity. 'Don't you fucking move, Kaia.' He said...  Mommies baby Is him, you see..
Shocking news.
C-O-O-K-E-D 😂
I can't wait to see how he's gonna gaslight his way out of this
If the dog killed him, it would be put down despite being a hero
Speed ran the "FA" part and will get a hall pass for the "FO" part.
Completely unrelated, did you guys ever here about the 2 guys who put vibrating anal beads up their asses so they could vibrate answers to each other on tests?
It would've gone better if he just admitted to it to begin with, and said it wasn't illegal where he is. But no, have to do this song and dance about it, like the pussy-ass low-IQ narcissist bitch that he is.
Wow Hasan really it’s pirate software😮.
Poki sucking him off right now
Is that a Hanukkah bush ?   Dog needs a wellness check
That's what happens when you record every day of your life and then lie to the internet.
Like, we joke about it, but that poor "prop" dog gets treated like shit. What a dingaling.
This shit is way to funny, how can someone be as incompetent in everything as Hasan is 😭🙏
I'm a dog guy and I think he's a douche cuck for shocking his dog, but like this is the dude who stands "10 toes down" with terrorist and said America deserves 9/11, I know this channel has been on him from day 1, but it's fucked how this is the thing that got everyone to really go in on how fucked up Hasan is
Nothing's going to happen to that terrorist supporting pos. So stop saying "it's over"
Dude knows he's been abusing the dog if he's afraid of having the remote on screen.  He is a Turk Muslim guys, there is no surprise he treats his dog poorly when it is surprising he even allows one in his house to begin with.
Not only did he use it to keep his dog in one spot for his entire streams, he KNEW it was bad to the point he tried to hide it - scum oozes out of this mans DNA.
*Same as the free Palestine people as soon as the war ended*  *Hasan's fans are pretty quiet about this too*
He trolling
I'm not shocked by this to be honest. But his dog is
I have an idea… Why don’t we storm Hasan’s videos comment sections pasting the link from this video 😂
Hey Hasan fans, go fuck yourselves. Retards
The one comment saying it's some kind of grip case to his zyn.   Yeah no a damn snusdosa is bigger than that without the "grip" on.
Wait is this bad? Are y’all actually educated on what a e-collar is? Professional trainers use them and they don’t just shock. Try it on yourself!
Hasan should wear a shock collar and when he goes off camera people can donate to shock him and bring him on stream again faster.
Typical leftoid. He wants everyone to wear that collar for their own freedom.
Hassan would make the Houthies proud the way he keeps that dog hostage.  What a massive POS he is…
Everything is falling apart for Dan Clancy. His favorite streamer that never gets banned is a confirmed animal abuser AND he has to testify about it in front of congress.
Why does he have a dog...he's from Turkey...Islam considers dogs haram.
Don't care
The fact that a dog is what's burying him into the ground and not the nonsensical shit he pours out on a daily basis is the most hilarious turn of events.
Can't wait for the Hasan and Candace Owens collab.
I mean this is what you get with women in power. They are literally saying.."we know he abuses animals.. but he's attractive and I have no morals!"
It’s even funnier that it’s the exact remote model we were guessing and that xqc was displaying with his vids
Hasan is a psychopath
ARF ARF ARF
F*ck that terrorist bytch
That dog is being held hostage and put into that tiny area for hours upon hours.
Hasan: you guys are courting death? Do you know who i am, i am the son of...    Any spoiled young master in any manhua.
Typical muslim behavior
CAUGHT
this is what would be called "an orgy of evidence"
I have a question to ask, why hasn't anyone ever try swatting Piker?   I mean, I know it's illegal, but... it could be well deserved?
C'mon guys its a False Flag! A False Flag guys!
I’ll be fair on one single thing. If you check the pager only collar on the website of the company that makes those, the remote is the same, so the remote doesn’t guarantee it’s the shock collar. With that being said : this confirms the company making the collar, and therefore confirms the collar he showed the other day is indeed one of the shock collars, because the design of the pager is not at all what he showed.  Hasan is cooked. Get the hell out man, and stop giving us Turks such a bad reputation. You’re a disgrace
Shock collars are fine. They feel like those prank gum packs that zap your fingers. What his brain dead fans refuse to acknowledge is the effort he took to blatantly lie because he knows he shocks the dog for unfair reasons
I think the most surprising thing here is that that demon celebrates Christmas...
I can relate.  I've done this with guns on office zoom meetings.
at this point i think hasan needs to get a brain scan so he can start collecting SSI for mental retardation
the internet is so funny the fact someone went and found this 😂😂
LMFAO caught
I am extremely happy to see that this asshole is receiving Pirate Software treatment now. As a Türk, I hate him with all my heart. I always say, there are few things in the world worse than a Türk who is obsessed with money and fame.
Hey Twitter, you guys are taking your sweet time with this cancellation, aren't you?
And all this just to keep his dog in one spot in background like a prop for his stream...
Hes not a nice person
at this point he has to be doing this on purpose because he knows his zombie audience doesn't care and nobody in a position of power will fire him...  piece of shit seems to think he's untouchable and every single gremlin below him does everything in their power to make sure he is... what a bunch of losers jesus christ..
let´s keep the pressure up, the final outcome out of this for me is that he will no longer use the dog as a prop, the way he talks a behaves toward Kaya just shows how terrible a person he is, it´s surprising he is willing to scold the dog that way in front of thousands of people.
Who would've thought the dude who supports the religion that encourages lying to advance their own ends would lie to advance his own ends?
I hope Hasan gets his ass beat the second he leaves his house
'Cmon guys...thats obviously not a....its for.....dammit' -every orbiters inner monolog
Time to see if Twitch decides to toss him overboard, or go down with the ship after he set fire to it. Though, I'm willing to bet they may just add more gasoline to the fire themselves.
wait so bald was right
There are two types of people in this world.  People that get hit with consequences straight away after doing something stupid,. The other gets away with  many things for a long time, but eventually all their consequences hit them at once. Hasan is the latter. It may be today, or tomorrow. It maybe in a few months. It may even be in a few years time. But one day all his consequences are gonna falcon punch him off his Twitch stream.
We got him boys...
Glad I don’t know where he lives. I would take his dog. Sick bastard he is. Hell has a spot waiting for him
what a turd
Its irony that its not asmon, not H3, nor anyone who destroy his career, but his own dog...  This Dog should be main character sequel of thriller movie 'Good Boy'.
FROM THE BED TO THE TV KAYA WILL RUN WILD AND FREE
I love how he looked at the camera like; You didn't see that, right??
I was to take that electric collar off of that poor dog and chuck it at Hassan’s fat head!!!! 🤬
Bros beyond guilty in the court of public opinion.
Lock Hasan and Piratesoftware in a room and the first one that apologizes gets to go free, they'll live together for the rest of their lives
Hasan will fit perfectly in a South Park episode
Stop hitting him!  He's already dead!
Is anyone going to do something 😢
im not sure who is more pathetic - hasan or his audience
Its Jover
Does the millionaire socialist have a back yard?
I wonder people going to report animal abuse?
Report him in mass to the police at this point hes doing it on purpose hed kill her if this causes further backlash. Mass report him they cant ignore us all.
And of course Twitch is radio silent on the whole thing. God forbid they applied the rules evenly.
The dog looks sad.
From the Fence to the Tree
This is all very funny but I genuinely feel bad for that dog :/
As legal mindset pointed out, what hasan is doing is animals abuse and illegal in California. So of course he’s going to lie. Whether or not commiefornia will enforce the law is another matter.
He’s a pretty disgusting human being
it has to be intentional at his point
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
U ugly mole rat. Act like ur any better
Seems rather appropriate that in the wide shot he has a prop dog sitting on the bed.
Biggest douche in the universe
Not hyperbole, not rhetoric. Hasan is a legit sociopath.
Ive always find him Annoying but now i despise him
Hasan fans who were denying it for the last 3 days: 🤐
Bro this is like being caught in 8k like what excuse could he possibly have now what a moron
You have to be a special kind of POS when you virtue signal all day but basically using your dog as a slave as an ornament for your stream.
hassan also has a vibrating plug? The chess trend is expanding 😂
i feel so mad, poor dog, thanks internet, you bring truth to the world
I hope this is the end of his internet career, piece of sht of a human being.
In the end it dosent really matter. The guy could straight up kick the dog in the face and his orbit would still be like ''Ooooh my god guys it part of the dog training''. They are so used to Hasan being lying daily it just another day on the job.
See how happy she is to move... terrorist supporter and animal abuser....
I had ZERO doubts that he shocks his dog. If my dog yelped like that, I would have jumped out of my chair to make sure it was ok. Not tell it to stop being a baby. Don’t get me wrong. I have no problem with shock collars. They do have a purpose but I can’t see a reason for the dog to be wearing it inside. My dogs don’t even wear their collars indoors and only wear a harness when I take them out. Plus, not owning it and just lying speaks volumes about his character. Did not like him before. I like him even less now.
It's not just that he's sing a shock collar, but that he's using it for something so incredibly petty. Like I would think it was kind of alright if it was to example train a big dog not to jump at people or bark aggressively at other dogs or another really bad habit, but just for forcing the dog to lay in place in a specific corner of your stream for several hours? That's animal abuse, that's someone who views their dog as a servant rather than as a companion.
hes a narcissist.
This dickhead is fucking disgusting. And so are all the unemployed extremists that support him.
The "communist" with a $240 dollar shock collar lmao
Just mass reporting for animal abuse
The dog is clearly an outlet to vent his anger, and now she is the source of what is already irrevocable damage to his reputation…really sucks, wish she could get outta there.
Wait... you're telling me that a commie, misogynist, terrorist sympathizer, nepo baby and a privileged snowflake is unable to take any responsibility or admit to any mistake... no way...
Poor girl. Getting shocked for just trying to exist, being kept in one room mostly is one thing, to be confined to a space no bigger than her is horrible, then getting shocked for wanting to ease the uncomfortable aches of her confined mat... harry potter thought he had it bad living under the stairs!
Is there a name for this phenomenon when someone messes up BIG TIME and it causes people to completely comb through their past behavior? I’m calling it the piratesoftware effect for now
Wow, look everyone! The lying narcissist just got caught lying and being a narcissist. WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN
I love the internet in these moments. Shout-out to the vod clippers/archivers!
I don't understand why he seems ashamed of his presenting as an evil villainous bastard. You'd think he'd want to own that.
even with all this, he'll still just pull his typical olympic level mental gymnastics
How tf does this video have so many views so quick wtf, 137k views in an hour 😳
Was anyone actually surprised?
In the heat of the moment, he claims it was Kaya's dewclaw. Now the story magically changed, the collar ‘vibrates,’ and the whole dewclaw excuse just vanished. Hasan’s pattern never changes: twist the story, play the victim, and argue just to oppose. Truth was never his thing.
What a fuckin idiot
I hope some rescue animal corp. NO PETA! find him a good owner to the dog, is just shit to use your dog as DECORATION!  I appreciate silly moments of cats and dogs appearing in rooms, is like when we were at the pandemic and the news was filled with a lot of silly moments of they with their pets appears in their rooms just wanting affection/attention. It was very cute and silly 😂
Save the dog from this vile human
Send him straight back to the lobby or at least in the Gulag
If he doesn't think it's wrong than why hide it?
This is Nuts Dude, Where is the US Army??
He's like piratesoftware but if people believed him even when he's obviously wrong
Now get ready hasan fans debate it
Free Dogestine
Peta said they hope it's not a shock colar. Now it's undeniable that IT IS a shock colar, and since Hasan is "one of them" they will be silent.
the main problem now is that he LIED to everyone including his own viewers, he thinks your stupid and hes perfectly fine with manipulating you with lies. this is the guy you trust to give you political info/advice??
What a shocking revelation. Bleh lol.
The way he forces his dog to not move at all, I couldn’t tell that doll with the Santa hat *wasnt* his dog
I don’t believe in or support shock collars, not really even e-collars, but I can see why people, especially trainers, would want to utilize them. E-collars come to mind when a dog walks out of their designated area. And just a fun fact, all shock collars are e-collars, but not all e-collars are shock collars. E-collars usually just vibrate or buzz. Shock collars deliver a shock on higher settings.  But it’s just the gross misuse of the shock collar that disgusts me in this situation. If I’m not mistaken, Hasan is literally just shocking Kaya to keep her in one place for hours on end. To make matters worse, the fact she’s audible in being shocked makes me believe he has it on very high settings and/or is shocking her longer than what’s let on.
Supposedly that one does have access to multiple different types of stimulation. The wording on the websites don't use "shock" but they do provide electrical stimulation. They call it "Blunt Pulse Stimulation". It's apparently supposed to be a smoother waveform, and is described more like "a muscle tap or tingle" and not a harsh sudden zap. So yes, there is a pretty good likelihood he shocked his dog. Hell, even if he didn't shock Kaya, the fact he was hiding the remote, not admitting it wasn't just a vibration, still shows he lied and hid that.   Also it even seems if he did use the vibrate it's actually a stronger  version. The manufacturer on the amazon page states it "delivers a tapping sensation similar to vibration, but more intense". Like regardless he used the remote, stimulated the dog, either directly or aiding in Kaya to yelp. Then lied about it being a shock collar, either because he is stupid and didn't understand "Blunt Pulse Stimulation" is still electrical. Or he is just lying and hiding.   The crazy part was I was leaning towards being on his side because of my experience with the dogs in my life. But bro lost me the instant there is proof he tried to hide that remote and lying about the collar.
Putting a shock collar on your dog is like declawing your cat. It is messed up.
I don't know, I don't find this at all funny. This is a psychopath torturing a poor dog.
Why doesn't he admit it? Because shocking that poor dog just for moving is some psychotic shit.
My tinefoil hat remains this is either a 3head or a 5head idea of Hasan's to divert attention from his love of "music video" creators from the public eye. I still wonder how successful this strategy will be towards the US government.
Wait.......Super Muslim putting up a Christmas Tree?🤔
I remember when twitch suspended me for an entire week because I told a spicy joke in a easily offended chat. Hasan could be selling heroin live and twitch would give him a 1 day ban, that they warned him first so he could take the day off.
This mothefer is always eating like a pig on his stream and he gives his dog no food.
Dude literally moved the collar out of the camera's view to hide it. Did he seriously think it wouldn't be caught?
Yet, still not banned.
The more you lie the more you need to remember
He wouldn't be getting half the hate if he admitted he uses a shock collar and just turned it up way too high. People wouldn't be looking so deeply into his past to prove him right but they sure will to prove him wrong and a liar
I'm genuinely getting pissed off at the constant it's over thumbnails  I'm not reconeding your channel anymore because of this  Be creative ftlv God dude I've seen your dishes have more of it before you cleaned them
From the bed to the tree, Kaya will be free
PIKERchu caught
He isn't the smartest is he
In the thumbnail are those 2 things around the remote detached prongs? or am I just doing the confirmation bias 😂
Hasan is literally a quasi- politician, they never admit their mistakes
A real tree already? Can you keep one alive that long??
0:20 Ladies and Gentleman. We got him.
I really feel for that dog. Having an animal be forced to stay in a certain area for hours on end out of fear of being inflicted with pain. Animals want to move around. They seldom stay in the same area for even 30 mins if they're not sleeping.
Bro it’s a dog.. who gives a shit
Asmongold should shock himself with this thing just to show people how painful it is. It would drive the point into a home run.
Hasan ain't never gonna live this one down. Never, ever. The best he can do now is come completely clean, give an honest apology for lying and let the poor pup have a little more freedom, deal with the fallout that comes with that, and move on. Besides, his leftoid rabid fanbase doesn't care about it anyway. All they want is to be fed a constant diet of marxist hateful propaganda, and that certainly won't change.
I'm shocked
This guy literally can’t stop nuking himself. I guess that’s what happens when you’ve been a fake human being in your entire life.
Expecting honesty from Hasan and his crew is like expecting Santa Claus. Even the kids know.
What a complete scumbag.
I hate all of you for making me know who this weirdo even is in the 1st place. Just look at his retarded face! Look at it!!!
Still find it crazy is that this gets Hasan and not the whole part where he OPENLY SUPPORTS TERRORISM.
This is clearly animal abuse. Somebody needs to report him to the Humane Department.
Maybe it's its own "vibrate" remote?
At least the dog gets electricity; people under left-wing dictatorships don’t get much of that!
It's his anxiety remote.
Let's see how fast he lies and how fast his cult believes him.
"My trainers recommended I use it,I thought it was a good idea, I didn't know how unpopular they are.  My bad, I'll do better now" could've saved him 80% from this.  But the problem is: he DOES know how unpopular they are
The way he looks at the camera like "oh crap" is sending me
He makes me sick
Lazy bum cannot even put up his own lame Christmas decorations.
Ok, now what? Nothing is going to happen to him like always
This guy is such an idiot lmao
"the educator" yeah okay buddy lmfao
when you think he can't get any dumber....
Animal abuser.
Nothing wrong with using it, why does he lie about it
Now he's going to start blaming the people that helped him move for planting the remote and making him look bad.
Remember he uses a shock collar on the thing he ostensibly “loves”, so what’d you expect for him to use on those of us he hates
dude is obsessed with shocking his dog. Loool so fucked up.
Even internet gooners that use it on humans are more transparent than him.
He's such a fucking clown.
He is a Muslim he hate dog.
Hasan will pop on his stream tomorrow with 2 of them stuck together with black tape, claiming it's a controller for his Xbox.
Arrest this mf animal abuse
He's shocking the dogs...
0:20 this is the look of someone who has been caught. 😂😂😂
What a horrible human... Poor dog.
Never stop. He’s needs to be shamed into admitting the truth and giving up the dog. Hold him accountable. Keep finding more evidence.
That is shocking
The bullshit is people are yelling around thats its a disgrace and unacceptable.. Yet NOTHING HAPPENS, NOTHING IS BEING DONE.. Everybody including you Zack are just grind your views and grinding your publicity, nobody with actually money and power will ever do anything against him... Force or file a case, bring it officially towards the twitch team or their bosses, publicly on stream that they will HAVE to respond.. Yet everybody is calling it out and DOING JACK SHIT!! If only I just had a small piece of influence or only HALF the money you had Zack and I would make sure his stream would never see the light of day again, and read again.. imtalking about his stream not him in person!
Kaya: do you expect me to sit? Hasan: no, i expect you to die
Hold on. Why is he having Christmas decors when he clearly hates Christianity?
He knows we're with him every second of the day. It's beautiful.
"I did shock my dog, but I am showing an example of what Israel does to Palestine, and Kaya's whining is basically how the Palestinian children feel"
Streamers who defending Hasan are showing their true colors. OTV looking at you.
Sometimes I think judges should have the power to add specific punishments to those found guilty… like prison for a time and a shock collar that shocks randomly at least twice per hour. I’m sort of joking, it comes from not liking seeing animals hurt. Works me up a bit y’know?!?!  Anyways, Stay Frosty Everyone ❄️💙❄️
Poor dog can’t even run across the house to bark furiously at the Amazon delivery van.
What about all his friends saying he didnt do it. So they lied
He is a demonic animal abuser who should be hunted
⚡⚡⚡🐶⚡⚡⚡ Oopppsss 😂😂😂 Lemme move it away  Ah... donuts
what a piece of shit he should wear that collar at night while sleeping while his dog bears the controls.
why would he leave it on his desk? is he stupid?  edit: nvm that was a stupid question because of course he is lmao
the fact in all these vids he tries so hard to be discrete and hide it means he knows its fucking wrong to most people with a brain. its gross... and yet the cult of personality will literally defend him to the death with pure delusion.
"Must have been the wind" shit is something he'd say for his defence
hamas piker will kill someone live with a gun on capera Dan Clancy will be here scking his dck during hamas piker saying he didn't pull the tigger it was someone else or that it was a bb gun
He's a smart person and knows what would happen. That's why he hid this. He's scandalous.
How the hell he fumble it so bad lmao
Hasan played FNAF Sister Location and was like "damn, that's a good idea"
Finally. Proven beyond doubt. Bye Hasan. Go die on your hill 😂😂
When you accidentally self-report by showing the remote to the dog's shock collar on your desk.
We gottem in 4k. Hasan is 1000% cooked.
ALL HE HAD TO DO IN THE BEGINNING WAS SAY YES AND APOLOGIZE AND SAY THAT HE WAS NEVER GOING TO USE THE SHOCK COLLAR AGAIN
The rabbit I mean doggo hole keeps getting deeper and deeper
Jesus loves you
Well well well
at this point he worse than piratesoftware
i say we all beat the living shit out of hasan and see how he likes it
This is the guy that considers dogs to be slaves.
This whole thing is starting to spiral like Pirates of Software did
"He never admits he's wrong, even about anything really small." As someone who grew up around narcissistic family members, this is very typical. They're deeply insecure people who cover for it by choosing to believe that they're perfect. Anything that shatters that delusion, no matter how small, literally breaks their brain. They'll either explode with blind rage or do stupid things like try to OD on pills. Either way, they're always the victim. I describe their mindset as being the only hero in a world full of villains. They can't process empathy either. It's not like a psychopath, where they lack it completely. They can experience it in their lucid moments. Especially if doing so makes them look good. But it's like trying to feed two contradictory statements into a computer. It causes their brain to crash and revert back to its default programming, which always prioritizes themselves. Hasan might actually care about the dog, somewhat, but the dog's needs are always going to be second fiddle to his regardless of the situation.
This whole ordeal is just proving that hasan fans (like most leftists) are willfully ignorant and will justify and deflect anything that makes their side look bad. Unironically soviet levels of attempted deceit lol
But what about Palestine??!! 🫠
Hasan Zapper did not zap his dog. The dog's collar just accumulated a lot of static electricity from moving around on the carpet. Allegedly.  😂
Someone get @Morepegasus on the phone NOW
He’s the type that will abuse the dog more behind closed doors because he got caught and will blame it on the dog instead of himself. If this ruins his life I wouldn’t lose sleep 🤷‍♂️
Hasan is clearly a sadist.
Do not let Hassan roach out of this.
I'm not surprised he abuses his dog. He's already a horrible person.
How the fuck is twitch allowing this
We need to send him to those Hamas people he loves.
IF you find yourself needing to use a shock collar for any reason, which you really shouldn't anyways, a dog moving 2 inches can't be the reason.
I was waiting for a moment like that while also thinking "ain't no way dude is stupid enough to have a scene with a camera angle showing the remote" Boy was I wrong...
Crazy that the Israel government sent someone to plant a shock colar remote on Hasan’s house. These guys are really obsessed with him!
This is why, even though I'm a left-winger, I watch content from all political ideologies... I personally cancel Hasan Piker
It's great gow they leaked the casting for Enel in One Piece.
It’s because liberal media will always run cover from them so they’re comfortable. Literally the left is above the law.
Release the Hostages
bruh LOL caught in 4k thats literally the remote for the shocking version 🤣and in the exact place he always reaches too in every single clip HAHAHA
Someone send me his address! I’ll go liberate this poor dog that deserves more love than Hasan.
It's not uncommon for psychopaths to use socialism to mask their condition, Stalin, Castro ect ect. Its camouflage.
How are people surprised?
I've named my Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Hasan Piker. I've already been shocked 6 times this year. I'm sure way less than Kaya has been.
You guys should google how practicing muslims treat/think about dogs.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT HIM
I guess Twitch wants to promote animal abuse?
What a disgusting piece of human trash. I hope everything Hassan calls for to happen to other people happens to him
I don’t own dogs is a shock collar bad? I thought ppl used it to train dogs?
As he's putting up a Christmas tree. Isn't t5 pagan symbol to him?
He treats that dog like the false religion of Islam treats the Jews.
im a furry and this is plain bucked up.. how is he not banned in Twitch? welp Congress will handle that
Hasan had the look of a sandwarrior in the top view; before the warthog "BRRRRRRT";
Not a good week for Dog mains
Imagine being so dumb you still believe him.  Just admit your commie terrorist god tortures dogs.
A true member of "peaceful religion" ...
I can already hear it in my head, his final Hail-Mary attempt at convincing people he isn't a POS. "Training hurts guys, you'd know if you ever got out the house you <insert list of overly aggressive insults in an attempt to gaslight people>"
Looking in the camera and all he knows damn well it is bad, why he hides and lies about it. Including what Destiny showed him taking off the collar keeping it under his desk so his guest and chat would not see the prangs. Yeah buddy that clip that the collar was too tight was where he removes the collar under the desk. Ow and it so tight so the prangs pierce through Kala's fur as he says himself "it doesn't work on such a furry big dog" how does he know? He tried and had to tighten it to make it work!  There is a list of streamers like Valkyrae, IDubbz and his wife that has to answer for their support of animal cruelty! Scum of the earth, defenseless animals or humans need to be protected by those that can! Add Caroline to that too, more scum.
His whole world just fell apart. He will ne bankrupt in 3 year's. Be living in a shack in mexico going. I use to be a big political streamer bich.
Why would you have the remote that close if you weren't willing to use it on a moments notice for any reason.
He's obviously doing this for attention at this point
I'd bet Kaya is getting the shit beat out of her for yelping and causing all this chaos for Hasan. Cause obviously in Hasan's head this is her fault.
"...and 'Paranoid Delusional Psychopath.'" "Got me there." -Muppets From Space
He is so cancellable
WAIT: 1:21 why does this muslim have a Christmas Tree and santa hat stuff in his studio?? TAQQIYYA MUCH!?!?!!?!!
Right where he reaches every single time
So can anyone call animal services about this?
Hasan is a wildly good liar. Scary.
Still don't understand why he play with food
Nothing will happen
Oh look another far left mental case has no empathy. What a surprise.
We're now entering the 'it's actually a good thing, and you're crazy for caring about it' phase.
Lifetime sentence of watching asmangold i  a plexiglass max security cell
"look okay, so it is a shock collar, but I didn't mean to press it with such high voltage. I made an oopsie." Why'd you hit the button at all? Hmm?  What was the dog doing wrong, that you had to "correct"? Hmm?  Dog wanted to move from his confined corner. And that's a biiiiiig no no, ain't it Hassan followers?
even with that we already knew that idiot ain't slick
Why wont he get arrested already
We have nanotechnology now, we should be able to manufacture electrodes small enough to attach to hASSan's miniscule nuts.  Let people make a donation to the Humane Society and purchase a chance to shock the violence-inciting, animal abusing Champagne Communist.
I want to see what the hasan glazers will say about the controller
Hasan and his lackeys are evil liars and they will go at lengths unimaginable to hide how evil they are.
I'm wondering how they'll defend this in the comments.
can twitch perma ban him now?
Twitch: A real fan never speak ill of hasan
what a worm
For some reason we have to believe a serial liar because he said he wasn't lying
she just clipped her paw, i swear!!
“Hasan supporter: show me proof that Hasan abuse his dog” 😂 I wish someone can save that dog cuz imagine what he does to the dog off stream when he doesn’t hesitate to shock his dog while online
You know what is worst? When its time for Peta to work, they don't.
Every single lefty I know NEVER EVER apologizes or admits when they’re wrong. I swear the are such twisted people. Not compatible with decent society.
has someone asked for a wellness check lately on the dog?
this hassan guy is such a fuckup dumbass it makes me feel better about myself
Asmon there's a genocide going on, how could you?
Wonder how his brainless cult of succubi will defend this one.
He can't keep getting away with iiiiiiiiiiit
%99 Chance Hasan shocked his dog, the only benefit of the doubt I'm giving, that %1 is that the collar does have "tone" and "vibration" only modes, but with how Hasan has handled this and his past with animals I'd say the chances he didn't shock Maya to be basically non-existent.
Nobody can deny the barbarism of Hasan on Dogtober 7th. This was the largest attack on dogs since the Haitian migrants.
"I do shock my dog, but it's ok when the left does it."
STOP NOTICING Hamas D. Piker
he is an infantile narcissist so her is never wrong
How could he focus on shocking his dog when there's a genocide happening?
Shocking..
PETA is useless on this btw.
“I did shock my dog, but she’s part of the genocide in Gaza and we had to protest with Houthi. Why are you looking!?” If that wasn’t a thought that almost came out of his mouth I’ll be surprised.
Someone take all animals away from this violent psychopath!!
Literally caught in 4k on live. 😂
Caught shocking that poor dog!  Caught lying about it!
Bro got caught in 4K, cant wait for his defense now 😂  Btw is that really a Christmas tree in mid Oct ?!?
That animal has to be euthanized  However that dog needs to be saved
"Mr. President, another shock has hit the dogo."
Hasan be like: "Whoops!"
Bro will say he has BPD and his other personality Assan was the one with the trigger the whole time
Shocking reveal
He reaches for it out of muscle memory poor doggy.
I remember seeing a tweet on day one of collargate that went along the lines of “it’s so hilarious that these schizo freaks actually believe Hasan just has a button on his desk, just for zapping his dog” and turns out that is exactly what Hasan has on his desk
Was there ever any real doubt?
The truth will out. No matter bad Hasan doesn't want it to.
Classic evil muslim! Pretty normal in thier culture!
i still wonder why isnt this man behind bars yet soo many evedince
How is anyone a fan of this fucking psychopath holy shit
Don't gotta be a trained interrogator to read THAT body language lol That look into the camera says sooooooooo much.
Maybe Hasan and pirate software should start a podcast together?
That comment saying just like Trump... That person is dumb as this topic
breaking out christmas decor early to try and change the mood.
The dude either is so stupid to notice or he wants to get caught.
"Oh, the camera's on. The camera's been on the whole time, huh?"
One day when it finally comes crashing down on hasan, he will answer for his actions.
i'm not gonna say the race of the doctor who planted that remote there
You gotta be a psycho to still think you fooled everyone. Or you think your audience is regarded
Oddly right in the place he always looks too right before an electrocution
Where is PETA?
My god is it sad that people will still defend him after all this evidence.  He thinks his audience is stupid and he’s right they are.
Imagine he accidentally hits the button 😂 and the dog yelps again 😅
Cowards at Twitch won't punish him in any way
I'm still wondering why he thinks we would believe HIS DOG is the one "spoiled" by his mom. dude was complaining about his internet speed and shocks his dog when it's not being being a prop. THAT'S SPOILED.
Hamas piker is 1000%BUSTED
Hasan try not to take responsibility challenge : Easy
I wanna see what Hasan's fans are gonna cook up to cover this up.
1:04  Guuuuyyysss Hasan wasn’t lying! He said it vibrates! And it does!…..it just does a little more than that
I can’t believe his dog made him do this 🐕
Dude a communist scumbag. He's about to be cooked
Man, i really wish Asmons dad lived just a little longer to watch this controversy unfold since he also watched Hasans stream. RIP Asmondad <3
My mum trained farm dogs here in new Zealand, they had electric collars and they hurt, me and my brother would wear them and shock each other or use one that worked on vibration, so if you talk it would shock you. No house dog needs trained lol, they don't do anything but eat, if you got a bad pet, its because the owner is the problem.
Yep.  Hasan really is retarded.  🤡
The contest isnt even on yet he still is sweating being the biggest clown of all
bu-but...but Hasan its a good...hes handsome and has a dog 😍♀️ -Some women as: Sasha grey, Lilipichu, Pokimane and Valkyrae, pro animal 4busers.
yea this think will be forgotten anyway
Free Kaya
The thing is, if Hasan attempt (poorly) to pass him self off as this sort of champion of the normal folk, ally of social justice and just admitted he was a money hungry piece of shit that only cares about him self and how healthy this investment portfolio is is, people would be a lot less likely to just be attacking him enmass for this. Like when Pokemane was selling those cookies at a 400% mark up, no one was surprised. No one that matters cared. Simps gonna simp. Now if she ever pretended like she actually cares about her fans, it would have gone up like a hot wet fart at a cold quiet funeral.
I literally said earlier today we’d get more clips, but I thought at least a DAY would pass. This is what people have found in just a few days. What ELSE will people find by the end of the week before they’re grasping at straws? And even then, some straws could be false evidence but some could be really convincing on top of everything else.
all the people around him are okay with it too which makes it wilder
Total Muslim Death.
“It’s my tv remote, I swear”
2025, year of the Dog Zapper.
He hid it, so he DOES know its wrong to hit the dog huh
Some streamer did some things  with a mostly peaceful collar.
At this point he should just sponsor shock collars.
Shocking new footage
Man, I am really worried about the dog. The collar, the bed that looks too small... The fucking owner, obviously. Fuck this guy.
All little Boy Hasani has to do is cry on stream and his low iq fans will believe he is the victim
I'd rather watch Hassan out of context than in because honestly, it's entertaining at this point.
deport hasan
How is there more 😂😅
It'd have been more respectable had he just said he uses a shock colar. Like anti-shock people will still be unhappy, but then you aren't a child who tries to hide the fact that the cookie jar is empty
America is a free Country so please feel free to do anything you want to including animal abuse since obviously, no one cares
it's like he is doing it on purpose atp.
They want everyone in those collars
He is done!
Nah man it's the remote for his butt plug vibrator.  That's why he's hiding it
This just confirms that Hasan was never a bright guy, he was just a master manipulator, gaslighter, lier and all around douchebag
Which means he blatantly lied to all of his loyal followers.
Bro its so fucking over. This has made my fucking day
Hides the remote then keeps the fn flashing collar on the dog? What a genius
The dog is living under sharia law
ARAB EAT DOG
I bet he kept the collar really tight so people petting the dog couldn’t see the electric prongs.
Actual scum of the earth
Violent extremism sympathizer doing extreme stuff to a defenseless animal, who would've thought
what a fkin liar dude
As if anyone actually believed his denial anyways.
This is really the most pathetic thing ever. The evidence is mounting up to reach Everest size and some people STILL think we are not to believe our eyes.  Just think about this: if the ones doing all of this where Ethan or Tectone... you know what would happen. You absolutely know.
i HATE LIARNS AND MUSSIES
What a POS
He is proving the darkness in humanity that exist. Not speaking of him but all who will follow him no matter what
I’d like to put the collar around him and hold that button down. Poor dog he really needs to know how it feels.
Sad that this pupper has no one to get it out of this situation. Stuck with a loser manchild that hurts em so that they remain useful as a streaming prop. 😢
Classic turk!
This shit is crazy
Took a little google search. In California, where Hasan lives...he is committing a crime. He is cooked.
cancel him already man
WE GOT HIM!
There's literally no reason to move that remote unless it's highly incriminating. 😂  I wonder what the Hasan orbiters are going to say now.
Oh my goodness it's actually real. I thought for sure it was a dog collar but that he clicked something to shock the dog I thought was overblown. Lmao I can't believe it, this is hilarious.
"You aren't just some rotten leftist. You're a despicable fiend who wears the skin of a leftist!"
never admitting fault is a sign of someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder
Hasan really is psychotic and retarded beyond belief.
Can't wait to her that bullshit excuse he makes for this
I'll foster that dog for free if someone liberates it.
it's almost like when people used their own eyes and common sense after the first clip surfaced and said, "This guy shocked his dog" were right
Caught in 4K UHD Dolby IMAX and his followers will still say Nah man
>its a grip case for his zyn... lol
It's clearly AI guys, you haters are deluuululusional
This news is kinda shocking……
Guys a vile PoS, but nothing will happen. He's called for terrorism, assassinations, shrugged at his community harassing people he doesn't like, and now abusing his dog, and he hasn't faced one iota of consequences. Not one. Guys a millionaire who drives a Porche 911. I'm convinced he could backhand a woman live stream and Twitch will still whistle past the graveyard.
Being the piece of shit he is I bet he resents the dog for this... physically.
I have a question: Is that a new clip or something they found in many hours? Because if it's a new one, you really wonder, how stupid that guy is that he has still this remote on his desk! If he would only have average IQ he would have removed it from his desk already.
"We did it Joe !"
1000% cooked
It is amazing peole have been working this hard to find these clips 😂
"Why are we talking about this little remote when there's a genocide going on!?"
"Oh..." It was at that moment he knew he fucked up
Shameful.
Who would have thought the low IQ clown who runs his mouth like a 4 year old and supports violence against everyone who disagrees with him would abuse animals and blatantly and repeatedly lie about it. It's almost like... he's a loser and a d*uche.
"Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake."
Moremoremoremore. Destroy Hasan!! Vengeance. Vengeance. MORE
They don't even realize that the collar vibration method of training requires the owner to actually shock the animal a couple of times to induce fear so when it vibrates or bips the animal thinks it will be zapped and "obeys", which implies that if it is just vibrating that she have been shocked in the past enough times to instill fear.
This just shows he has zero expectation that anything will happen to him.   He's this brazen that he knows Twitch will do nothing. They never do.  I can't stand Twitch dude.
Twitch ain't gonna do shit about it
In 4k dawg, c'mon man !
He is Excommunicado.
And the moron calls attention to it by looking up at the camera with an obviously guilty look "Oh shit, that was on camera just now...heyy 😅"
"Oh what tangled webs we weave when we first practice to deceive"  He should've just been honest.
I think his family treats him the same way his dog gets treatment. "Don't you get enough? Stop complaining" some tough love.
What's funny is the collar doesn't even hurt the dog, bro glazed terrorists for a year and gets canceled for using a collar that vibrates.
wtf is that not animal abuse? Hope his dog gets taken away 😅
OMG Hassan is literally restarted and nobody can tell me otherwise. I just pitty everyone that has to put up with this moron.
So he’s ok with blatantly lying and we should trust him on politics?🤣
Dog yelping through shocking while sad looking at the guy in fear wasn’t enough for his fan base? How about the actual remote. Poor pup.
Jason "Thor" (Piratesoftware) dude is very similar in that regard, those two will never accept anything wrong on their side, narcissists to the bone.
what a pos this guy is
It's the remote to the vibrator up his bum.
Hasan: oh this thing,oh its just a tracker for my dog and the light beeps green to show his being tracked  Hasan of today: lets hide this shock remote out of the frame and pretend i did a stupid to confuse my audience, works every time.    yeah i think youve been caught in 4k hasan time for the FBI on your doorstep.
Hamas Piker for the past few days: "I did not shock her! It's not true! It's bullshit! I did not shock her! I did not!"
Israel put that remote on his desk
Hasan probably started shocking his dog more off camera since this
Dog abusers deserve the worst fate imaginable, if there's any spec of justice left in this world, let this monster suffer for his treatment of this poor creature.
why wouldpeopleeven careabout some dog owner doing too much harmful disciplinary rule on their pet when you FUND genocides? its weird. dont you think? why do you care dogs more than human lives? look at what your trump did now, its a CEASEFIRE. its not an end. and he is goingto plant TONY BLAIR on gaza. you know what will happen next. and then peoplecomplain about some dog owner harmfultreatment to their pet? you fund a human cleansing. i can list over 300 million f***ups in the US right now.
Clearly Clara put the shock collar remote on his desk. Just like she installed cheats on MissQGemini's PC.
heading straight to the D-Bunker's clips surely hes seen it too
i swear hasan and his viewers are so brain dead
Who cares!? They are made for this reason!? To train ur loud barking dog! 😡😑 Yall just stupid! It has different settings it doesnt have to be maxed out! Geez! They dont "hurt" the dog! Its a mild shock. Ive worn one before as a stupid teen. 😑 so i know! Yall act as if hes TORTURING the damn animal 😂.. pathetic!!
Hasan's fanbase is running out of copium.
Btw twitch bans anybody that talks about that, instead of banning he who thunderbolts his dog
Such an evil disgusting person, once again not surprised he would lie and deny things when caught, and now as always all the evidence and proof is surfacing, just like with his disgusting reactions to dead children in coffin by laughing at it and celebrating people's murder. This isn't about politics, this is about exposing this disgusting person and having him take accountability, Twitch let's him get away with it, but will the law. We'll see.
It’s a bold strategy Cotton let’s see if it pays off for him
Hasan going down for this is like Al Capone going down for tax evasion.  Whatever works lol
Its a violin
Hasan stands are like democrats they will never admit they are wrong or what they did. they will gas light you until you give in or they exile you.
His response will be... "Fuck it, I'ma say it dude. AmeriKAYA deserved ET-300."
If that isnt enough evidence i dont know what is your honor 😂
The Poor Dog is nothing more than a Prop. What a Chitbag.
But is it OVER over for that complete waste of oxygen????  I am so sick of that a**hole.
hahaha what a moron
Hasan will never change unless legal action is taken against him.
i would like to point out that hassan isnt the only bad guy here his family clearly doesnt care abt the dog also
It's not about training the dog, it's about a sick control complex. This man is a true monster.
I’m excited to find out how this is The Jews’ fault…
Dude, he really can't be that stupid. Oh, wait...
Hasan is such a retard lmao. Asmongold makes a great point that he's *_incapable of ever admitting that he's wrong about anything ever, no matter how small..._*  *_His blithering, seething, idiot, horse fucker uncle is the same way lmao._*
That's it 100%
STOP THE COUNT!!!!!
Wait for HASAN excuse.  "That's not me, THAT VIDEO IS A.I."
0:20 Literally pulling a face like he got caught in the cookie jar.
When can the next free mason sacrifice take place? I elect hassan be the next martyr like kirk
the fact he tries to move it out of camera view only makes it even more damning, he's so damn fake bro, everything about him is fake, curated and manufactured, i hate it, he really does belong with the mainstream media and their mutual love affair is not surprising at all, he's really just another one of them, an extension of MSNBC. Basically he has no issues with shock collars, doesn't understand why anyone would be upset, but he recognizes they are for some reason and so pretends to play along just to shut everyone up, it's so dishonest, it's so fake and i just must point out yet again that leftists talk about empathy but they literally have none.  Vaush was a psychopath who was open and upfront about just saying and doing whatever it took "to win", Hasan doesn't understand why people don't think it's good to put shock collars on animals or would be uneasy and upset about him calling for landlords to be dragged out and drowned in blood, others in the left cheer for murdering speakers for their speech and ask for more, promote harassment, violence and persecution of people who think differently, and these people go on TV and talk about empathy like they have any, i can't stand the mountains of BS
Can't wait for Hasan Orbiters like Valk to defend that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯
Nux and Rev need to see this And pegasus too
He can’t keep denying it now 😂
The Internet is Best Sleuth!😂😂
It’s simply impressive how deep of a hole he’s able to dig for himself.
this stupid is DONE, i can't stop laughing. poor dog 🐕
Hasan speedrunning ‘make yamper in real life’
this is why all those retarded ass streamers should've kept their mouths shut. they got bullied by hasan into making a statement for him, now this. all them idiots saying "I've been around Hasan and kaya, he would NEVER". looking at you Valkyrae. miss "I need to be more aware". clearly she wasn't aware of this, right? Hasan doesn't hide things from his friends after all. but he would never shock his dog, right valky?
Someone should call the police on him
Why he lies so much?
WHY is this human scumbag not in jail yet???
e-wizard remote
Yeah instead of just saying that he uses a shock collar, removing it and being sorry, he is lying. He could even do streaming content with it, put the collar on and shock himself everytime his dog isnt staying in place
Dude, why are you laughing so much at this? The guy is literally abusing his dog.  It makes me more mad than anything. I don't even dind it remotely funny.   Kudos & a big thanks to everyone who is reporting him.   I'm just a little shocked at the amount of laughter.  That dog deserves a loving home. Not this palpatine prick.
This dude is a POS and I have no idea why anyone started watching him in the first place and am even more puzzled that people continue to.
He'll say it was made up by " the juice".
i hope this ruins his career
It’s for the suicide vest
I already f*ckin knew, poor Kaya, animal rescue needs to save her, Hasan does not deserve Kaya.
The look up to the camera is golden. 😂
So its for training? But it is also banned in multiple countries i wonder why
And Valkyrae protects this sh*t dog shocker??? 😂😂😂😂
When he realised he reacted the same way the dog does when he turns to look at her.
Yet his fans will STILL go along with whatever bs story he comes up with...and randomly say we should worry about Gaza instead.
A truly shocking confirmation
Caught in 4k 😆😆😆
I like this series
If it's just a vibrator why do you hide the remote:D
Next thing will be: "I did it, so what?" He'll still have a lot of meat-riders defending him and we'll be back where we started
Has anyone called animal services on him? I hope that poor dog gets rescued asap
Can we put him in prison for a season please?
Shocking...
twitch supports animal abuse?
this is just funny honestly. just admit it. most socialist use shock collar on their own people, using it on a dog is normal in comparison.
-I didn't shock the dog. She clipped herself to her bed. You are stupid if you think I would shock my dog.   -Fine, I did use a collar, but it only vibrated; it doesn't have the capacity to shock. You are stupid if you think otherwise.   -Okay, it is a shock collar, but there is nothing bad about using it. If you think this harms her, you are a stupid person that doesn't know about dogs.
People joking but this Hasan queer is a total cunt
animal abuse
Thank goodness you can milk this stupid shit for another 2 weeks.  Easy to avoid the Epstein when you have to talk about some moron shocking his dog.
I honestly dont get why he has fans to begin with if he's that obnoxiously stupid
We are all mentally ill though, according to him.
It's clearly the remote for his special toy
bruh asmongold really happy
I salute the dude who stayed on Hasan's stream to screen record this shit 😂
SEND THAT TRASH BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM FK HASAN
He needs shock therapy.
I have a damn pitbull. Way more stubborn than that dog. If you raise and treat your dog with love, all you need is to raise your voice or a firm BAD GIRL. She HATES “bad girl”. This clown is just a fuckin coward and can’t even earn or command a dogs obedience. You think it’s easy to call a pitbull off when it’s chasing a squirrel? Lmao. Try it.
insane bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone needs to report his animal abuse
Hasan Adolf Diddler Epstein Pikerachu is an animal abuser!
Wtf is an anti western, anti christian, anti capitalist doing with a christmas tree and decos?    The only thing real about him is his denial.
Good dog. Bad owner
EVEN FATE, LUCK AND NATURE IS AGAINST HIM 💀  You cant time this up
Bet you his supporters will figure out some way to try and make excuses for this
CAN WE FINALLY FUCKING PUT THIS TERRORIST BEHIND BARS?!?! Holy shit, how much crime does someone have to commit LIVE until their dealt with?!?
send him too Gaza!! lets see if he really likes it that much
destroy him, forever.
It is funny when you try to hide something and it only makes it more obvious. I think the saying is; the wicked flee when none pursue.
I feel like him lying about it makes it worse like he's trying so hard to keep an imagine thats not even true
Why would Israel do this :(((
He can't be that dumb. Ah, it's Hasan The Terrorist, he absolutely can.
Psychopaths love hurting animals Hamas Piker is a psychopath
This is like seeing new 9-11 clips of the towers 😂
I can’t wait for the next chapter in this sage. The dog shit is depressing me
I hate this fuck'n asshole
The remote to his anal vibrator
It's literally just there....nice and close....just in case....like a lighter for a cigarette....or a cell phone. Holy fuck.
Put the collar on Hassan and let’s have a lottery of who can shock this SOB when he steps out of frame.
The Educator
im as shocked as kaya
It's SO OVER 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 it's so pathetically funny 😂
Welp, that's pretty damning
jover
So sad another public L for a so called communist why can't there be good people who associate with this ideology
Why wouldn't he hide that thing at least while he streams?
Oh, what a piece of work is Hasan.
A Muslim abusing animals?  I'm almost as shocked as the dog.
Remember these are the vile scumbag people that preach morals and think they are on the right side of history :-)
Will be interesting to see how people try to deny it now
I thought the positioning of the cameras of the last stream to not show where the remote was was suspicious. looks like I was right lmao
Dude this guy is such a fkn slimeball
Where's John Wick?
This man isn't just a pathological habitual liar but he's also very evil in how he can just keep lying with intention
wake me up when he´s in jail!
now.. what would happen to him? he broke the law (again) but no charges or investigations were made and he is still on twitch...
I'm not shocked, are you tho?  Kaya most certainly is
Yet again the internet is undefeated B)
Can we stop make evil en retardes people famous, AKA Hasan.
The fact that he doesn't allow his dog to get up and move, without any food, water or a proper dog bed FOR HOURS on end on a daily basis just so he can use her as a prop in his streams alone makes him an animal.abuser. Thats not even mentioning the shock collar.  The other fact that his dog is very obviously terrified of him when he only looks at her shows he does way worse to his dog.  He is a horrible human being.
Bro
F everyone who is putting christmas decorations up and its october. I hate how people gloss over thanksgiving and go staright to christmas its the most greedy and selfish holiday . Thanks giving is supposed to be the day to be thankfull of things
Set to "STUN" too, look at that
One of these days Hasan will just say "What do make so much big deal about it, it's just a dog".
Rip bozo
welp. So.... are we going to cancel him now - can the other side do it too
Think meatcanyon will.make a video?
Could you imagine having to hang out with Hasan all day every day, and occasionally you get shocked for your trouble? Buy me a bullet and rent me a gun.
While I share the concern for the poor dog, it bothers me that after all the awful stuff this guy says and advocated for, this is what finally turns people against him.
Cought in 4k
Lmaoooooooo omagawd this is so funny
Socialists soon to be arguing in favor of shock conversion therapy.
Hasan's dog sitting services ™
He is not beating the allegations.  Good 👍
Kristi noem shot her dog, you should do more videos about that.
im so impressed by the fact that he would keep that on his desk. any sane, or at least not a moron would put that away. I genuinely think this motherfucker clearly knows its a giant load of shit and nothing will happen to him. he will face no consequences.
It saddens me because it was obvious from the very first single clip where people got outraged, so many dumb people out there, parasocial devotees. This absurd level of validation is purely because of brain rot, it was never needed. The whole discussion about what actually happened and catching Hasan in his repeated lies was all unnecessary, it was obvious he would lie and did lie, all the work in tracking every detail down and finding more clips was just for those brain rotted, it doesn't matter though, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
hasan keeps making the mistake that its the same people trying to cancel him. its not, this news has reached outside the target audience and he's labeling them as schizos who are just concerned animal lovers learning about hasan the first time. which in turn makes the new watchers spread the word. sorry hasan, this is a new raid boss and your old strategy is only making it stronger
how can you talk about Hasan when there's a literal genocide going in gaza. oh wait can't use that anymore
Oof, he a dumbass
For sure low IQ
Collar me shocked
It's genuinely crazy that there are people in the same room as the remote but they chose to not speak up.
Hasan must be banned from twitch now
Diversity?
Why are they setting up a Christmas tree? I thought he was muslim or islam sympathizer
Guys its an israeli SPY DEVICE!!! Also it never happened and also youre insane and a right wing extremist for thinking this is what it CLEARLY is
you can't be this retarded
Can’t believe they planted the remote for a shock collar in the room. Sarcasm aside, he’s starting to be like dsp, give them enough rope, they hang themselves
This is who Pokimane defending then, huh?
Yeah I’m thinking deport
"We got em...We fucking got em."
Me think I'd be close to be a millionnaire if I'd gotten a dollar for each time a streamer said it was over for Hassan.
bro let us see the remote rookies mistakes
GOTEEM
Somebody rescue doggo
The best part of this was the ending and he said Oh...
I didn't accuse asmon of this but other people did. "Why was asmon defending Hasan so super hard?"  People said this because they perceive asmon as being unreasonably generous to a clear and convincing liar. They saw a kid with chocolate all over his hands and mouth and you got asmon defending him saying "you don't know if he ate all the cookies, the chocolate could have come from anywhere".   Hasan was guilty 100% on day fucking 1. How did I know? I'd just look at him.   Guess who's right?? Yup. Now I didn't accuse asmon of defending Hasan. I didn't mind read him as being that way. Asmon just goes extra careful on drama for people he knows. But I just want to say it was obvious from the beginning. There was multiple tells the guy lied and if he has to lie, then it must be as bad as everything thinks or WORSE.  Im saying this because I thought asmon was too hard on the people who was firm on Hasan being a liar.
What's the big deal?
He has the subtlety of a hemmaroid 😅
"Ladies and gentleman We got'em"
Theres not many unforgivable sins on the internet but hurting animals is one of them
As Adele would say: This is the end Hold your breath and count to ten
He never admits that he's wrong because the great god hamas diddy piker is never wrong, you see. Everyone else is just Israelis in disguise trying to take his flock of followers away
I want to taze Hasan
my biggest curiosity is towards hassan viewers 😂 why do you guys watch hassan?  is it the politics? is it the animal torture? or is it his looks?
Can something happen instead of just circling around to more videos, hes already red handed. Not asmongold twitch and any animal shelter organization its tiring how people get away with this and nothing happens just like insider trading but at least get some justice for a defenseless animal.
This the type of shi that makes thanos look like a saint
Can't animal welfare take the dog away???
''There is no way outta this one, you're done''
“Shocking news” said Hassan’s doggo.
I'm not shocked by any of this tbh
Hasan "Red Handed" Piker
maybe it's being called a nazi for a decade but I'm starting to understand the German perspective pre WWII. If they are evil, and they cannot be reasoned with, then they should be shipped off to camps and unalived. That's what Hasan and his orbiters deserve. Maybe we are the "fascsits" lol. Maybe they are making fascism the only option...
Such a POS
Whats over? Delusions hopefully.  Who cares if he uses it. Only you no lifers that hate somebody for existing care.  People lie all the time look at your right wing leadership.
This whole dog shock situation truly is K-9/11
Top leftist streamer torturing animals just makes sense
What fucking psycho.
Sick guy
bro if he just went ''oops my bad it was an accident'' day 1 and went over to pet his dog, That would be it. But he created a DOMINO of lies and excuses and all his friends built a FORT of bad defense and cancelled entire pocasts and everything, over this ONE remote.  He turned 1 feather into a whole grilled burnt chicken
lmao
Hassan won't own it because he knows his behavior is scummy and does't fit the manufactured image of himself .... He'll get away with this one, but he's so stupid he'll get cockier and next we'll find his strap-on
He's a pathetic narcissist bitch boy. He's never been told no, never been disciplined, so now he has this inflated ego where he truly believes he's untouchable. The only surprising thing is he always tries to defend himself. This man could commit murder and not be deplatformed or banned, that's how much Twitch loves the taste of his dick.
Wonder if all the hasan defenders will relent or double down now. My guess is double down
Just put the leash on him and make his own neck vibrate! It's harmless! It's for educational purposes! It's for training! I swear....! Those bitch of friends around him as guilty as him. How could they stand this?
Hasans community thinks OJ is innocent after reviewing the evidence.
this dude is so fuckin dumb lmao can't believe people still watch hasan the clown
PEOPLE STILLL DENY IT IS SHOCK COLLAR?????????????
The dog botherer is out of control
So, is asmon finally willing to admit Hasan did it? Or is there still no evidence?
If he's under all this scrutiny, WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THE REMOTE OUT. This is just wild to me 🙄
The dude knows his audience will buy anything and don't actually have any morals, despite how self righteous they act. They just desperately need some form of plausible deniability, and Hasan can't even provide that.
lol😂
this is Shocking
Abdul, get the rocks.
Hassan seems like the type of person who'd take out this frustration of him getting caught on his dog. I'm really scared for the dog's life right now.
What a fucking loser
1:30 house of cards
Hasan is as cooked as his dog bruh
Jail mf
dang dude all this with his dog and trump ended a war this dude is so mad to be himself rn i bet lol
The Mossad placed it there.
I feel like Hassan is that general from A Few Good Men; he *wants* to just say he did it, but he knows he can't. Asmon: "did you shock the dog?  What Hassan wishes he could say: "YOU'RE GOD DAMN RIGHT I DID!!!"
At this point, i honestly think he is doing at purpose. I mean, seriously. How is he slipping up over and over like this?
none of this matters since he wont be banned and nothing will happen to him
BUT... BUT THE GENOCIDE!
Never believe a socialist.
😂
Asmongold can’t win in a debate so he has to try and character assassinate Hasan
I'm shocked.
I use them that's a expensive one I off leash walk my dogs so to keep them from chasing shit into the road it's beep vibrate and shock that shock is low on it I love my dogs and I tested that shit on me mine not the terrorist lovers and mine I have set to less then the old shock pens or lighters
Twitch LOVES Hasan, unless a boycott of Twitch happens he won't be banned. It will just not happen but needs to. Still find it weird people ACTUALLY watch live streams though, bizarre
While trump is still in the mood to bomb muslims, can he start the next round with hasan? After kicking in his door and liberating the dog first, of course.
I hope the internet over reacts to a horrific level lol
Hasan is 100% doing bad things to Kaya right now for ‘causing him all this trouble’, isn’t he, man is literally evil Eustace Bagg.
He knows it’s a shock collar, it’s why he’s trying to hide it… it’s almost like Hasan lied about something… 😂
Shocking…..
Yet nothing will happen because somehow Hassan is above any moral standards.   Somehow literally openly supporting terrorists and abusing animals is acceptable to twitch and many people.
I cannot wait for the Meatcanyon cartoon.
0:19 the look of someone who realizes they fucked up
Let's talk about why they are setting up a Christmas tree.
I'm not shocked.
Hassan is the next P Diddy and Asmond is 50cent. I called it first
I feel like that was intentional, or is he that dumb?
Hasn the fajot
The amount of mental gymnastics going on to not believe one's own lying eyes.
he needs the Hamas Terrorist treatment. I hope someone breaks in and brutally tortures him to death on his own stream.
I bet the dog wished it was in China to be eaten instead.
Hamas Palpatine Piker who owns the senate will weasel himself out of this with his Twitch CEO plot armor.
See the problem is that if he ever admits he's wrong, he has to shock the dog, and then he has to lie about not shocking his dog, thus creating an infinite cycle of pain (mainly for Kaiya), is that what you want? Who's the real criminal here? Hasan, the dog shocker, Kaiya the spot mover, or us, the audience who hold him accountable for his actions. Obviously us lmao, what do you mean?
He did the thief look at the camera
Even if you ignore the shock collar. Why does his viewers think it's okay for a dog to sit on the same spot for hours?!?! The dog might as well be caged, at least the poor dog wouldn't be shocked for wanting to walk around its home. Holy crap!
Another sad part is how his minions and the far left believes he is a truthteller.
It's not funny at all. It only takes a stare  from this gypsy for the poor dog to start trembling again. Shockers are not even used for training K 9 dogs. Dude is just using the dog for an image
So he fucked up?
If you think shocking dogs is wrong you know absolutely nothing about dog training.  Every elite dog trainer on the world shocks their dog 99% of all dogs in the military, special forces, police and high level dog competition like IPO and guard dogs are all trained by shock. This is really a sad attack on Hassan.
Everything you post will shock me more
Hasan : shocking your dog is actually good for the dogs health
Now the POS will go all in on arguing that shock collars are a legitimate method for training your dog, still denying any fault or even the fact that he continually lied every step of the way. He probably will deny he made any attempt at a cover-up saying he was honest the whole time.
Dude can't stop torturing his dog for even a week to even fake being a good person. He has to keep it with him constantly so he can shock the dog whenever
It’s a video out of context.  *sweating intensifies* He was framed.. In the video frame.. Must.. Resist.. Accountability..
Guys, that overhead-shot was made by an israeli camera, it can't be trusted.
Well, now surely they'll realize he's been lying the whole time, right?   Oh who am i kidding, Hamas-Diddy-Osama-Bin-Houthi-Palpatine-Piker fans never realize.
Muslims will cheer this on, they hate dogs.
Narcissists can not admit they messed up.
He will never get in trouble for this sadly ☹
how will they defend him now
1:24 was psychoanalytical, he definitely is a very insecure 6'4 streamer.
Wheres john wick when u need him
Hasan should just give it up at this point. Game over man, game over.
I find it so cruel and heartless that people turn a blind eye to Hasan spouting terror propaganda, then those same people recoil in horror when its revealed he has a shock collar on his dog. Like the terror stuff wasnt evil enough? Oh now you suddenly care kind of situation.  Disingenuous and flat out fucked up if you ask me. And now look at him trying to hide it.
Fascist terrorist bastard abusing animals
caught in 4k
He know he fked up when he looked up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lets see Pokimane fire her staff after this...let the dumb do dumb things!
as much as I think Hasan did it, the 2 remotes shown don't match up at all other than overall shape.
Lets see him, his sickofan and orbiters try to excuse this now...
aaaaaaand caught in 4k, ON HIS OWN CAMERA
You guys are wrong. That's the remote for the vibrating beads that he shoves up his backside before streaming.
Wait until we find out the inhumane methods baldy uses to keep his pet roaches under control!
CAUGHT IN 4K, LIES HABITUALLY, CHAMPAGNE COMMUNIST.
While they're putting the tree up and everything 💀
Enough said when literally there's needn't to, the guy did it himself. Let him expose himself even more.
seriously how is the dog not taken away from him? why does he force such control over his dog? he wants for the dog to sit 20 hours in one spot and not allowed to go eat or drink?
Why doesn't he just stop using that and get rid of it? what the F is he thinking?
Turns out “don’t mess with Cats” isn’t limited to one species. Bless the internet
Mostly peaceful "spot training."
He is so stupid
That's all folks
Hasan the Pike eater rider insert your best here...needs to wear the collar and set up a donation line and every donation he gets shocked.
My guess is Hasan will just keep doubling down. He isn't mature enough to admit he can be wrong and won't take accountability. At least his behavior is exposed and people can see what he is like.
We Need A Peace Deal Here...
What a cretin
I constantly see comments saying there's nothing wrong with this. Either I'm crazy, or I'm the only sane person among sadists. Shocking a dog with strong electricity is completely unacceptable and should be punishable as animal cruelty. I have a nine-year-old German Shepherd, and the harshest punishment he's ever experienced was 30 minutes in a locked room.
I dont care about dogs. But imagine being inside the head of someone like that for a day. And then you will enjoy your life a lot more.
The shock collar is minor compared to forcing the dog to be confined to such a small space for so long
Ok, will he be arrested?
HAHAHA
Don’t worry guys the shock was tolerant
Michael Reeves has the most experience with shock, where is he anyway?
In my state animal abuse is a felony. I wonder if it is where asmongold lives?
CAUGHT
People actually watch this pos?
Of all the mountains of lies, gaslight and hypocrisy that characterizes Hasan's whole career, there's a chance that twitch actually bans him because of animal abuse. They got Al Capone on tax evasion so yeah, I'll take it...
Using a shock collar isn't inherently that bad for early dog training on the occasion BUT shocking your dog to keep it in a corner for hours on end using the poor pooch as a background piece to the stream is just fkn wrong
And yet he still hasn’t asked her do you want to go for a walk on stream
He's a psycho. The kind of person who would leave you in a dumpster if you made him mad and he thought he could get away with it.
What is his address?
Bunch of snow flakes in this chat. Yall act like this dude is dog fighting. Get a life
Leave it to Hasan to destroy Hasan.
Welcome to the Mouse Utopia Experiment Version Human.  Enjoy the Decline.  Can we put the same Shocker on Hasan for the next 20 years set at 200% shock value?
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him
I have 4 dogs, the most discipline I do is a prong collar for walks. Shock collars are unnecessary lol
what a piece of shit, the fact that he tries to hide it makes it worse, just admit you shock your dog cause you are a shitty person
I thought he's a Muslim, why is he partaking in Christmas?
Commies cant be seen being wrong let alone admit it.
Now his orbiters gonna say either those were his car keys and he moved it to reach the donut  Or he did it “on purpose” to troll the “haters”
I am shocked! SHOCKED! Well, only Kaya is shocked...
He keeps it right next to his fucking keyboard
How in the fuck is he this fucking retarded
Hasan's head is tiny because his brain is the size of a walnut. He's so dumb it's actually funny.
Shocking Behaviour
Made the same mistake twice 💀
What a POS. Dude is pathetic Hasan he should be banned along with his orbiters
The hardest part about lying is keeping track.
Never trust a man who puts his Christmas Decorations up In October...
Bro is shocked that he did this 😂
Hassan proving why he is a Liberal by lying and torturing his dog.  You know he does this to girlfriends/boyfriends that come over as well.  And given the access he'd probably nuke the US as well.
Moving it after its been in view just makes people talk about it.... if he just left it there than 99% of people wouldnt of noticed, honestly could of just grabbed some boxes or some wrapping from delivery and nonchalantly place over it while talking to someone
So... they call him Baba Yaga...
It is actually crazy he's using a shock collar to keep his large dog trapped in a small bed all day...
what an idiot, jeez bruh
And for this, he must face Sam Hyde in the ring
why are they putting up a Christmas tree? seems like the last people who would or should celebrate such a holiday
All the genocides in the world will not end until this dog is removed from his house and finally free
Omfg
He should've been honest from the start, would've been easier to forgive
Someone call Peta again, I hope the dog gets rescued.🙏
It’s so over
Ok, cool, so its confirmed now. Hasan is a little dog abuser. Unfortunately it isn't illegal but, that dog deserves a better home and Hasan should be boycotted. All his stupid opinions go out the window when you're a little animal abuser. What kind of manipulative asshole trains his beautiful dog to stay in one place, and for what??
Hasan is literally one of the most idiotic people I have ever seen on social media. Flabbergasted.
i'm so here for the downfall of hasanbinladinbyatch
Truely Shocking... the dog
What a fu*king virgin
THIS is Hasan's worst nightmare: personal drama where he can't control the narrative LMAOO
Optics obsessed freaks tryin' to pretend their not actual scum-of-the-earth. Fakes and pretenders.
Another F in chat for Asshans poor beautiful abused dog
Hoping praying this is the last time he'll ever be mentioned again.
he's an idiot just like his uncle
For someone that likes calling people he doesn't like dumb, he sure is a fucking moron.
The thing is he KNOWS it's wrong. It's one thing to own it and say "Yeah I use a shock collar. It works well for training and I've used it for years. I stand by that decision" It's another to, on MULTIPLE occasions, move it out of camera view because you know full well that you're doing the wrong thing.
Hes a dog abuser and his followers are protecting him!! Its so crazy. Poor Kaya. Someone needs to save that dog!
Shocked if he moves, shocked if he doesn't. Thats terrorizing the dog. Pure abuse.
what is the big deal?
Ya know if he gets flooded with this message he’ll go nuts since he knows he’s just an investment tool nothing more  *Hey animal abuser how long are you gonna try and get mahmet’s approval? kinda sad you want billionaire daddy’s love so bad you support genocide and sprinkle in random left wing phrases to justify it. Even funnier that he’s not even your real dad, mommy wasn’t so pure as your uncle leaked years ago. You’re nothing more than a puppet to him a tool to be used and discarded. Daddy ain’t buying you out of this one you’re no longer worth the investment have fun in jail.*
this is... messed up... wuuu...
This was a perfect moment to prove it wasn't a shock collar, he has the remote, sees it's in shot, knows he got caught. He could say "look chat I'll prove it once and for all. Kaya come here" he takes the collar off, let it dangle between finger tips, hold the remote up, press the button and bam all it does is vibrate. Lmao this jackass
dude, shut up. Stop talking about him. He's not getting canceled he's not going anywhere ever. He could commit the worst crime in mankind, and he'd still have a platform omg. Plz stop talking about that vermin.
Shocking discovery...
This poor doggo needs to be saved 😔
If he admits he lied, it means anything else he said can be called into question in his mind. Even though people already question him. It’s just that this is so easy to prove with his own footage. HE CANNOT FAIL IN HIS LIES.
Someone needs to put a shock collar around his sausage neck & see how he likes it.. absolutely hate people that abuse animals, worst of the worst. 🤦🏿‍♂️
Jail him
Wait, so he’s an actual psycho? He knows shocking his dog is unethical, which is why he feels the need to hide it, yet he still does it?
Mate, the internet is a scary place if this is how they get down with investigating something.
Wow he’s fucked
after he hid it and looked up at the camera he was like oh fuck
I hope that this is the end of Hasan. This monster deserve it. Divine justice at work.
“The Mossad planted that on my desk” excuse coming in 3…2…1…
REF.!! Do something!! 😩
Hasan, if he ever wants to stream again, should be required to wear this collar and allow his chat to instantly shock him at any time, no limits, for free.
He showed a vibration collar that he uses, it’s the same brand E-Collar. Wouldn’t it use the same remote?
Disgusting..
he is a garbage human. even the last normal person should realise it by now. only retards left to serve him, sadly the world is filled to the brim with them
That's a setup by Israel.
From the fence to the tree, Hasans dog must be shall be free!!!
Why are we surprised he has the remote to the collar he showed on screen again? Hasan is a POS.
The nepo-baby champagne socialist is caught in another lie.
Sociopathic narcissists never wanna lose control or wanna stop obvious abuse.
THIS IS TO DISINFORMATION TRACKER, GATO FUMADOR, AND BINK.  IT'S OVER FOLKS!
shame on all that defended this clown
Did he really think people wouldn't catch it? Pushes it out of frame than reaches for cookies as a cover? Damn, it is the sort of thing we'd do as kids.
If he just say he was wrong, and he is sorry about the thing; I dont think people would drag the issue this long. Like, his haters will still chew him for this. But people who are neutral about him would probably chill at that point. Instead, dude is clearly lying and trying to cover everything up. Its just weird. I really hope that remote have nothing to do with the collar, but he is making this hard for himself by the second.
My brother has a shock collar for my dog. Pretty sure its just. Vibrating one. But she's a belguim malinois so she does need one
Caught in 4K.
Someone just put him out of our misery 😂
And people said that I was lying.. Typical hasaners
Defenders are going to be like "Bro it's just a tamagotchi and he's moving it out of the way"
prison
We got him
Take him to Detroit!
Cujo gonna get his ass
Holy shit dude
It is ridiculous that a false narrative is being created that there's serious animal abuse going on.   The only reason people join this narrative is because of toxic American politics. Show this to any non-political European and they see no problem with this tool, the dog or the human.
I'll gift anyone who kills this guy with 100,000$
What a pathetic little man. Hasan makes me 🤢
Bro thought he got an own but got caught instead 😂
The guy pouring through 1000s of hours of this fucking buffoons stream needs professional supervision and cash hose.
I cannot wait for his response to this lmao. He just has to admit that he lied
Filthy animal but that's  a pretty dog
Bro hates fascism and abuse of power unless he’s the one in power
The second plane 😭
Hasan is the type of guy that would say "that's not me on video" while murdering someone when its zoomed in on his face while saying its me Hasan. he is a pathological liar and a psychopath. it's so obvious. who tf screams for equality when living a rich life style that has hobbies like having a dog who gets shocked and trained to sit in 1 spot during a stream. that's elitist mentality and the psychopathy behind it is scary,
Lets see how Wokiemane and Wokyrae explains this
this means he was lying to his own viewers!
I'm genuinely debating on buying this exact model and testing it with the prongs off and filming it just to prove to everyone it does in fact hurt
Hamas "puppy shocker" Diddy Piker gets caught with "vibrator" remote on stream.
Trump got the hostages back.  Someone tell him there's one more that needs rescue!
That poor dog will be treated even worse after these incidents
It's going to be the blatant lying that gets him gone for good
in 4k
cant wait for the hasan riders to say "he had just moved it to that spot youre only showing a small clip not the thousands of hours of the dog growing up where did he replace his remote all those other times?!?!?" "you need to prove every hour to me or its fake news"
So heartbroken for that poor pup. I loathe that piece of Muslim shit
I remember when the worst thing that happened on Twitch was someone forgot they were streaming and had a gamer word moment. How far we have fallen.
This is genuinely so sad😔
Turkroach
Hasan: DISCHARGE!! ⚡⚡⚡Doggo: Double Deep Fried ☠☠
"oh the camera was on...the camera was on the whole time huh?"
can someone knock on his door and ..... ??? please just do it
Hasan's favorite Metallica song: "Ride the Lightning."
This will not convince them, 100% will not. God Himself can come down and show irrefutable proof and they STILL will not believe it. Not being hyperbolic.
I was doubtful but thia could be a serious hit to his career
you underestimate the brain dead zombies that is his base 🤣
Call animal rescue NOW
Why the f*** is he not banned off twitch and his dog given to ASPCA or PETA?
what a shocking turn of events
Ladies and gentlemen we got em
If he said “Yeah, I don’t like using it, but I do use it on occasion to help train the dog that my mom let do whatever she wanted” nothing would’ve changed for him. It’s the lying and the double standard that have people upset.
That last part...my ex wife. Fuckin up more n more lately. I think shes borderline with clinical narcissism if thats a thing but yea shes the type to smack you and then try to convince YOU she didnt
The dog was sticking close to someone other than her owner and wagging her tail. Just pointing that out
People throw money at this fucking idiot...
This is amazing
"LYING TED!" LOL
Imagine what this guy does off camera
“I did shock my dog, but it’s actually because she likes it” Guarantee he’ll say something like this
Not surprised that terrorist condoning asshole also bullies his dog.  His dog should be taken away from him.
I find it poetic that the words above the remote fade in with an electricity effect☠
Hasan is retarded. That's been the problem the entire time.
The dude cant stop doubling down. I cant fucking wait to hear his excuse on this.
Mr. President, another video has hit LSF.
Hasan Piker is an animal abuser.
This isn't 4k,this is 40k.  Bro got cogth in 40k
He's probably worse when the camera is off while all you douchecanoes make fun. You're all disgusting.
Its like god allowed South Park writers to manipulate reality.
Well, collar me shocked.
Hamas Zapper. 😂😂😂
this just happened 30 min ago wtf
it's soooo over
So why does twitch allow streaming of animal abuse which is a felony in CA?
Where is PETA when we needed the most? Let's test their actual purpose of PETA.
Let's see how his brain dead fans try to defend or deny this.
Can you stop saying it’s over at least tell ur editors to stop saying. Like bro it ain’t over. Dudes gonna continue abusing his dog supporting active terrorists. Like bruh who cares anymore at this point
I hope he dies in the electric Chair. Zap his ass until his eyeballs explode.
Getting shock treatment multiple times each and every day
Can confirm. That is the remote for the ET-300 Mini Educator E-collar. I use the same model when I take my dog out hiking off-leash.
HA
2025 year of the crashouts. Especially hasan 😂🤣
Dude is such a clown
He really is as dumb as we think he is😂
that is terrible! I am shocked!!!!
From the couch to the TV - Kaya will be free ✊
So can we call the police now since this constitutes being unnecessary pain and suffering for the dog, per CA law?
What a pathetic ckunt. I hope Hasan gets AIDS
Its like beyond confirmed ✅
internet detectives are insane and I love it
Can people stop putting hasan in a pedestal now?   Also, those other streamers that defended him must be feeling great right now lmao.
Nothing will happen twitch will do nothing
Can't believe someone can shoot themselves in the foot twice!
Poor dog
His punishment should be a shock butt plug
Yeah, that was the smoking gun. Everything before looked very suspicious but this is not something he can talk himself out of. The thing is that if he admitted it at first, it would still have been bad but by constantly lying to his viewers, that will make them considering what else he is lying about too which is a whole lot worse. I have a feeling this will cost him...
I'm shocked!! Shocked... Well not AS shocked
Storm spirit mains aren't beating the allegations
I hope the dog ends up with someone that loves it, but somehow I'm doubting that will be the outcome. Prayers for the animal.
Dude is torturing his dog for clicks and people want to claim he's not the bad guy... 🙃
From the shock on the stream, the remote have been seen.
I wonder who on poly market either won big or lost big
Damn
It's literally classified as animal abuse, if you shock your dog without actual reason. place training, is not a reason.
Who watches that dude anyway. Looks like an entitled prick
Don't get me wrong, I hate animal abuse, but why after all the things he's said and done, calling for people's deaths and supporting literal terrorists, is this the thing that's actually made people mad?
best doggo ever
It's also exactly what Charlie said too. That Hasan obviously hides this from his friends and family too.
So all of his “friends” lied and now have lost all credibility. Every single one of them went down with the ship.. edit: the orbiter’s as the musicians playing the last song on the titanic while it’s sinking 👌
Also it’s illegal where he lives
Send in peta
Save the dog
And he’ll still sit there and say you are insane if you think he’s shocking his dog
He just training for his future wife
Palestine friendly electricity
what's insane is that people will see that and still defend him. absolute brain rot.
Betcha nothing happens out of this and Hamus Piker will continue his millionaire socialist lifestyle unopposed
i would say this is chocking news but there is only one shocked here and thats the dog
It feels staged for some reason.
Hasan has to be autistic, right? The way he looks up at the camera...
fucking r3tards
Hasan Sparker and the deathly hollows.
Asmondgold is a grifter
Same face as when Macron or Starmer moved the bag of coke on the train. Guilty af
did he at least get sponsored by mini educator?
Ha! Don't make it too obvious now, Hasan. It's crumpling just faster and faster. Finally!
HASAN PIKER, IM COMING TO RESCUE YOUR DOG, FROM YOUR HOUSE, IN LOS ANGELES  NO, IN REAL LIFE
bro… the internet is just a scary place lmaoooooo how did they actually found it
Wait why doesn't he get arrested for animal cruelty since there is a lot of evidence
he could ave said, its training....but we can see he knows what he is doing is abuse, so he hides it,  ass pounding prison for him please, wretched are those that harm defenceless animals
A muslim who hates dogs? who would have thought?
can we put hasan behind bars yet
Poor dog :(
This dog is being TORTURED bro
Can't wait for the "It's not a shock collar remote, it's a can of Zyns DISGUISED as a shock collar remote. Anyone who disagrees is a fascist Zionist plant attempting to deplatform me."
Doggo gate
Its not about proof at this point, its the fact we are seeing this save device over a span of time. This guy was using this thing frequently, its disgusting to be honest. Something deeply wrong about this person for doing this to a poor animal.
But nothing is gonna happen. Hell just get more viewers
Cancel bastard retarded hasan
Lying TED... 😂😂😂
Looking at the camera after bro OMG
if you dont like dog walking around, why get one?
It's so over his viewcount hasn't changed. 🤣
so your saying even he knew it was bad 😅
Wow..... just wow....... how much worse can the saga get? 😅
Starting fires. Hurting animals. Next will be humans.
Remember he tried to make you doubt yourselves. Gaslighting psychopath that he is.
Hasan makes it so easy to hate him
CHIDORI MOTE
Must have been those Israeli supporters who put it there.
From the fence to the tree puperstine will be free.
Israel hacked my eyeballs to make me believe Hasan shocked his dog tragic.
shocking
He's gonna say he is a patsy.
I feel this is actual grounds for animal abuse, keeping a dog there for hours like that as some background object for his stream is fucking sick, its not even so much as him having one for his dog but how he's using it.  If he's not banned over this Twitch is going to burn.
Lying Ted with a dog ugly wife😂
Hasan kicks puppies confirmed???
they prob fucked kids.
Beyond a shadow of a doubt…
dude you could post more important things
Hasan keeps SINKING HIMSELF   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
he promotes genocide: I sleep He shocks his dog: Kill him Animal abuse is bad Genocide is worse I feel like we should have done this shit a long time ago
Guys, you idiots. It’s clearly the remote for his vibrating plug, that’s why he moved it out of frame, he’s just embarrassed that’s all
Now a Twitch ban must come
Dumb question because i must be behind on the drama why are we mad he uses a shock collar don’t a lot of dog owners do that?
Here comes the "Yes, it happened, and here's why it's a good thing" stage.
What an idiot LMAO. He will say this clip was taken out of context and his followers will defend him anyway lol.
So I guess Invisible Fences are inhumane as well.
Anyone who harms a dog like this is a.. C aring.. U nderstanding..  N ineties.. T ype.
I see more people in real life smacking their dogs, Shoving their dogs, punching their dogs, yanking their dogs, and using Shock Collars. Hasan could've avoided all of this, by just saying "yeah I use a Shock collar on my Dog. So what? There are people who do far worse things to their dogs when they're misbehaving. A Shock Collar is nothing compared to what others do." People would've had their bitching online, then it would've been over within the weekend, but no, he continues to Insist that he does not use a Shock Collar, instead a Vibrating Collar, and keeps hiding it from everybody. He's gonna need the Golden Shovel from Minecraft to dig himself out of this.
Ok we definitely have full right to report or sew for animal abuse
Man do I wonder if Twitch will ban him for animal abuse. Hahahahah, I'm joking, he could literally hijack a plane and they wouldnt do anything to their golden boy.
Call the vet or something and stop fucking laughing
Hasan Piker the dog striker
Isn't it a little early to be putting up a Christmas tree? We all know this evil bastard doesn't believe in God.
I mean, is it really a shock to anyone?   Besides the dog I mean.
Who knew a lefty would have "just do what I say and I won't hurt you" rules in their life? I'm shocked!
The shock collar is one thing, using your dog as a prop for hours on end is the big issue here and is blatantly obvious. Shes a huge dog that should not be in "place" for 8 hours at a time. My girl is half the size and changes position and does a big stretch often. Its like keeping your dog in a tiny crate all day. Poor thing.
someday save that dog please.
I hate this mf so much. 😂😂
This guy is a real jerk!!
What a shocking revelation...
Put him in Guantanamo bay and give the dog his own country
FREEE THE PUPPY NOWWWWWW!!! GET GRETA ON THE PHONE!
Nothing is going to happen. We've been grifting on Hasan for how long now?
Caught in 4k
That dog needs help.   As someone who has 2 of them, this hurts.
Twitch is corrupt if this guy doesnt get perma banned. Abusing animals on stream and by not banning him, they are endorsing it.
Until Twitch doesn't ban him, or Twitch dies altogether, this will be just another source of memes with no real impact, and he will keep being the nasty piece of work he is.
His face should be beaten in for abusing his dog
And even with all this video evidence, Hasan's sheep followers will still believe his side of the story and will probably make up another coping excuse. That, or they'll deflect it on Asmon and his followers because they have no valid argument.
that f-ing thing has bigger prongs that a legit stun gun for humans!!
This dude deserves jail
This Hasan dude is literally a Darwin experiment at this point
Just to clarify for those who aren’t aware about shock collars, they tend to weight less than a banana
I wonder what his orbiters will say now
"Just like Trump..." These people are insufferable.
It’s so over. LMAO
‘It’s so over’ ~ Hassan chatter
GET THE DOG OUT OF THERE! REHOME THE DOG!
what a SHOCKING development a THUNDEROUS applause 👏
Someone clearly underestimated the time availability of twitch users, and how willing they are to use it to find literally anything they set themselves too. Sad for the dog.
Will someone from the US ring the ASPCA? Dogs being used as props for hours on end for live streams, whilst being shocked for moving is animal cruelty.
The saddest part about the whole thing is... Nothing...absolutely nothing what happened to Hasan!!
Here before hasan fans come explaining why shocking your dogs is good
omfg what a loser
I would say vindicated but did even one of us have second thought at this point. No. We already did the self sanity test. Looked at each other. Compared facts and evidence and deemed Hasan guilty in our opinion. The icing on the cake was all the post evidence coming out. The cherry on top is basically Hasan confessing that he did it a few days ago when said even if I did do it it would not be that bad. This new proof... while I guess it does prove it 100%. I find that ultimately we had already determined this a couple days ago. So I'm not even a tiny bit shocked. I wish I could say the same for his dog though.
Many people use shock collars, don't understand why this is an issue
Hes a devil
He is actually re*arded....
can someone put the et300 to hassan's neck?
LIARS LIE  shocking  i know
WOW WAA WEE WOW!
He bought it as a shock collar but he modified it to vibrate
BUSTED
PLEASE GET RID OF THIS GUY !!!!
Based on his ideology, this is exactly how I'd expect him to behave. He won't admit to it because lefties will never accept any accountability or responsibility.
Yep, this is the final nail in the coffin.
His followers are delusional. They worship him.
LOL!
Btw Hasan Defense Force, the HDF as I call them, is literally calling this a “Zionist smear campaign”   Bro thinks he’s my nicka Fuentes.   Come back when you’re deplatformed and debanked.
Asmon's career would've been over day 1 if he were to abuse a dog like Hasan has.
Nah, no more jokes. Animal abusers will get what’s coming.
I bet his viewer still deny the obivous truth with another bullshit excuse, typical reflection of the streamer I guess
Hasan has a Christmas 🎄 😳 WTF
Busted T-sided bitch
What in Gods name how these MFS got a dog
Okay, you can get his ass now. It IS proven now, with evidence.
Is this clip from the streams after the one where the dog yelps?
I always thought something is off with his dog, I mean it always looks so SAD. I knew some dog has droopy face but his dog doesn't have that man, it's depression face, not droopy face
No food, no water, no toilet, no walking....
They said streamers should be more shocking Hasan took it personally.
what a pathetic excuse of a man
It is not over until we see some handcuffs
This guy Hassan should end his pathetic stream forever
Reddit: "lncels can't get laid because of their bad personality" I guess lncels should start shocking dogs since Hasan has so many female simps. Such a great personality 🤣
XDDDD hes fucked
That dogs going to end up mauling hassan pecker i swear
And the best part is, every single ahole that defended him, and sit there on his side, saw the controler, saw people confirming the model, and straight up lied publicly
WHY IS HASAN USING A VIBRATOR ON HIS DOG!??! HE'S FORKING SICK!!! FREEKY AHH!!
It keeps getting worse for him the more he lies about it. He could’ve just admitted he tortures his dog and his fans wouldn’t care anyway because he’s advocated for worse and they cheered him on. But at this point he has no choice but to continue with the lie despite being exposed over and over.
Not only got exposed for being an absolute trash human being, but simultaneously showing how much of a pathetic liar he is.
Y'all pissed at this, wait till yall find out about the kid at the brothel......
What is wrong with that  clown bro
I don't have a problem with people who use a shock collar to train their dog.  But I have a problem when they misuse it to abuse their dog.
Anyone else kinda think he might of done this on purpose to get one last view spike
Even more shocking news.....
p.o.s. Hasan needs to go bye-bye
Dude is a monster so it's not surprising he would torture animals.
Where Is The FBI On This?!
Ladies and Gentlemen. We got em.
The way he looks up at the camera with guilty written across his face 😂
Can't wait to see xqc reaction 😂
The he stuffs his face 😂😂😂😂
I knew 100% he was lying, a dog doesn't whipper like that from a vibration...and if the dog caught a nail on something it would favor the paw it hurt.
When reached for comment, the dog only had one thing to say: "I'm shocked!"
Know what f him
REF! do something! ...ref!
So sad how Kaia is so happy around people. She deserves so much better. Let his Mom have her.
What happend to "Hasan is very careful with showing things" he getting old or something?  Loved the guilty look into tho cam tho
His fans will tell you that's a remote for his living room TV.
Yep, he not good human...let alone a person
If he was genuine with his conviction that it wasn't a bad thing he did, Hasan wouldn't need to hide it
We live in a time were people deny what’s in front of them
Piker you fucking idiot.
Holly shit , it's over!
"Wow i'm shocked" - Hasan's dog
I know this is cope but come on, Twitch has to do something about this. It wasn't him saying words, it was him abusing his animal.
he doesn't care about his dog at all what a psychopath
NEW KAYA SHOCK ANGLE JUST DROPPED 🔥🔥🔥
That face he made 0:20...  caught with his hand in the shock collar jar ⚡️⚡️🤣
Hasan's stupidity is actually impressive. His career is sinking over the collar and he still has the remote on his streaming desk. Is Hasan being paid to sink his career rn? How is it possible to be so reckless with your infinite money glitch?
Just rename the channel to "It's Over" at this point since you can't come up with any other material, editor.
Kaya ain't allowed to stand 20 toes down.
Wait you telling me he celebrates Christmas?
😂😂😂 he’s cooked lmfao crazy how this led to people being fired 😂😂😂😂 wtf
That look at 0:20 says everything we need to know.
Hijo de pta
I hope yall realize he’s literally playing you LOL, no way he would make it that obvious
Kaya for President! She took out the biggest threat to America! 😂🐕⚡👌
Hasan Hussein
If he wants to fix this....wear it and have his stream be able to pay for shocks
hasan fans will claim this is AI
Damn. The muzzie’s taqiyya didn’t work this time, huh?
Hasan is a liar, always has been.
There going to say we need to put this empathy for the dog to the molesters in Gaza
Terrorists aren't very bright.....
It's his vibrating butt plug remote
Asomongold is unequivocally a worse person, but I will say I've always questioned Hasan as a stand up guy
A christmas tree in october? Somebody needs to put the shock collar on hasan
So in the end, it wasn’t his radicalism, his calls to terrorism or support of such, or even own extremism and calls for deletion of other people, it was his mistreatment of his dog that brought him down… brilliant. (Also more brilliant when you remember how fundamentalist Islamic countries treat dogs, karma is a bitch and she is a good girl)
he could decapitate the dog live and nothing would happen to him.  he knows what he is doing. Flexing how untouchable he is.  its not over he is not finished nothing happens to him
His fanatics will find another reason to defend a terrorist supporter
The way he looks is as guilty as it gets, free Kaya
Why that man hasn't removed the collars and all remotes from his house is beyond me. He can't be that stupid.
The problem is WHY he used it.
We had a K.O. Like 5 clips ago. This is just that one dude beating the unconscious WWE guy now.
Looks up at camera 😮 😂😂
I'm not even shocked
b-b-b-but it’s actually a good thing guys! There’s no way to train a dog besides shocking it every time it does something you don’t like. Dogs aren’t supposed to have free will!
Yikes yet people will continue to defend him anyways
At this point if you still watch him then you're just evil lol
These are the small moments I love the internet
Guy literally supports Terrorists but this is what lefties are crying over... lmao
Honestly this is just so sad. I feel bad for the dog, and I feel bad for him. He's clearly a sociopathic liar who feels the need to use a dog as a prop. Absolutely reprehensible.
Just bad optics once again for Hasan, but lets be real here kids, there is NO LAW against shock training a dog in a lot of places.
In Brazil, if some neanderthal like him do this to a dog, the people get the dog from him and put this shit on him...!
Come on bro like you give a damn about a dog
C O O K E D 🤣🤣🤣
probably a remote for his buttplug vibrator surely
You can't beat the internet. It will find out.
Yup, the long antenna, the stubby turn adjuster for the intensity, the circular shape of the remote.  I wonder when Kaya is going to turn into Picard in the Episode "Chain of Command" and just starts gnawing up the remote.  Then, out of dim lighting steps Gul Hasanabikat and softly speaks with the voice of a torturer: "That wont help, I have many more. Now tell me, how many lights do you see?"
Lol Hasan fans will still gargle his balls, even though he provably lied to them, doubled down, and continued lying. He lies as easily as he breathes.
Plantero Applebees water dinero  Has a lot of money from working at Applebees is a plant person always gets caught in the rain
Now that the war in Palestine is coming to an end, we can all finally start to move on and address this situation, right? Or are our priorities supposed to go to some other thing across the world that we also have no control over?
Shocking, isn't it?
The guy is basically brazen and pompous enough to slap you across the face, then have the nerve to tell you it wasn't him.  And what's wild is that it works because he still has an audience who would 100% believe him even then.
Totally a vibration collar guys. No wait, she clipped her leg. No wait she’s being too spoiled.
Who cares about the shock collar... more worried about the jar of peanut butter sitting there??????
That poor dog..abiding by sharia law😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 The crusades must begin once more
Asmongold hassan's number 1 fan
This situation is horrible but the memes are fire
Editors moving quick recently.
"It is a tv remote" Hasan's fans probably
It’s not over though is it he still streams
🤣
The Internet does not sleep
The collar needs to be put around this piece of human garbage's neck - zap his sorry @$$, sitting in his chair and watch him yelp while streaming his b.s. 😡
Kaya is in an open air prison
Fact: Twitch won't ban him for Animal abuse. It's fkn crazy how much evidence on this sht yet there's nothing happening in that sht place.
no no guys, that's uh, that's his prostate tickler. For reals.
I hope this evil man will burn in hell.
this guy is retarded lmao
The world has gone John Wick on Hasan.
The internet is the true parent that this guy never had.
How are his orbiters going to defend this?
Another plane has hit the tower
What a weenie
Who do i have to pay to put a shock collar around his neck and zap him whenever he promotes terrorism?
Babe wakeup, new Hasan shocking his dog angle just dropped
To the Left, lying is as natural as breathing air.
IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE
Free Kaya
So everyone there can see it.   Any time hassan does anything bad and any one of his friends stand up for him remember this.   They are all liars.
blows my mind how this pos terrorist lover / animal abuser is still on twitch...
I thought Valkyrie said he loved that dog. 🤔
Islam runs Twitch.
poor dog man...please someone save it. he looks so scared
Supreme Leader did nothing wrong
Collargate has been upon us, it is now certain we have a microcosm of Hasan's sharia law being imposed upon his dog for all to see.
Heh, what a shock
People are wrong its actually the remote for the vibrator that chess player had in his ass.
How do you even fuck up trying to hide it THIS badly!?
Even after all the checkmare. Hamas Piker's defenders will still making excuses for him.
I cant believe the dog is whats going to take him down lol
Lmao gotcha bitch
Is the shock collar banned in America?? is yes the he's cooked
Well, he is a liar.
but guys.....how and why are you so concerned about this when there is a genocide happening?   In all seriousness though, this guy is just a dumb narcissasist and the ones defending are just as braindead
Think it took this long because no one with a soul watches hasan outside of his tantrums.
At this point you could almost believe he's doing it on purpose to get attention. I'm willing to believe he's just that dumb though.
Hasan is such a dumb lying F*ck
What's wild is he STILL HASNT STOPPED USING IT, even while he's in hot water for using it. He literally can't give up control for even a day. Absolute sociopath behavior.
We knew he was a lying bastard, but at least now there's proof. And it's not just about the dog, either - he called people that were calling him out over this 'obsessed and crazy, lunatics.' But here's proof that he lies. And if he lied about people being insane for calling him out THIS time, obviously past times he's tried to wave stuff off he was lying about too. This fuckin' weasel really thinks he's all that. He needs to get knocked down a few pegs. Someone, anyone, please, get this guy jailed... He's a danger to the public, he's a danger to animals, and he's a lying brat that slanders everyone who disagrees with him.
"They're shocking the dogs, they're kicking the cats!" -  Orange Man Badass
You gotta be fu..king kidding me
What an evil prick he is.
dude is so dumb that he still keeps it on the very same spot everyone saw him reaching to every time.
That dog needs to go on a homestead or ranch in nice cool weather where it can do whatever the fuck it wants not be chained to a bed by fear of torture for views
He's so pathetic he can't even set up his own Christmas tree.
None of his LA friends are going to acknowledge the more concrete evidence of the shock collar model and how Hasan is clearly lying about some things (for whatever reason). The funny thing to me is that people like Sydeon and Sasha give Hasan excuses for using a vibration or shock collar, but Hasan’s initial claim was that he never pressed anything. Hasan doesn’t want to come off as lying about anything, so won’t admit he used it even if he believes it was justified for training. This difference in the story between Hasan and the streamers defending him needs to be pointed out more… like a video compiling all the defenders and how their stories don’t line up at all  I believe we need to pressure someone close to him to admit that things aren’t lining up with his story (even if they still support him) to have any chance at creating a rift between Hasan and the variety streamers that defend him due to their friendship. Being annoying and spamming chats or YT comment sections won’t work
Shocking news... haha
Geeee I wonder what else he would lie about
And twitch will keep protecting this dumb ahh lying abusive sociopathic POS
hilarious. I feel so bad for that dog.
People who support terrorists are usually never good
Got em 😂😂😂😂
I wonder what the Hasan Piker Defense Force is gonna say now
The fact he keeps it so close tells you that he's been shocking the absolute hell out of that dog off stream.
HAHAHAHAHAHAH, idk whether to laugh or cry.. that poor fking doggo
Hey ik we all hate peta but the evidence is right there sue him for animal abuse
i saw him the other day do this when he wanted the dog back on his bed you saw him reach for it  a real POS i would put a collar on him
Its like watching a child with their hand in the cookie jar.
He supports terrorists. Is anyone really shocked at this point? Well except his poor dog...
Its not a shock collar. It's a vibrator...for his remote butt plug
If Twitch knew any better, they'd drop him like a hot rock. Cenk, get your nephew in line...
Can always trust Asmon to keep us up to date on "current" events. This just in: 100% confirmed what happens to the dog when she goes 10 toes down, in shock collar, for the Hasanouthi.
what would have been the icing on the cake is if he pressed the button and shocked his dog as he was pushing it out of view I mean that's about as solid as proof gets but if he hit the button the look of defeat would have been joked about for years to come
I'm shocked 😮
Hasan could've just said "I didn't know this was wrong, my trainer said to use it and I assumed they were right". He could even lie about it and get away with it. But instead, his first reaction is to lie. After all, lying is a habit he has lived for his entire life, and the habit of a lifetime isn't broken so suddenly.
Genuinely how is he not banned yet
So you're telling me. That all the friends that know him so well, have hung around with him and kaya, have sat in that room on stream with him......have never noticed the shock remote. That he clearly leaves lying around because despite all the 'drama' it still didn't cross his mind to sharpen up for a while. At this point I am so confused, is he paying them to play along or are they all just that scared of his cultbase.
I guess we are now at the " IT'S GOOD THAT HE DID IT" part
Hasan: It's just a red herring  Thine brain: No you were caught red handed. What is wrong with you?
Hasan is a terrorist and people are surprised he would abuse animals??
He's not beating the allegations
Classic scenario when the coverup is gonna do wayyyyy more damage than the crime.
😢 poor doggo
Subhuman filth.
Wait, you're telling me that the pro-murder-of-innocents guy is also a confirmed animal abuser?  Shocking.
"Another plane has hit the tower." That caught me off guard, damn nearly choked 😂😂😂
Dude dug himself into such a hole lol. Why not just say he uses a shock collar? I love my dogs more than life itself, yet I live in an apartment complex and one of them wears a shock collar to curb his barking when I'm gone. It will first beep, then beep + vibrate, then beep + vibrate + shock if he continues barking. It's not strictly "animal abuse"
I am shocked. SHOCKED. Well, not that shocked.
I can't believe Mossad put that remote on his desk...
Muslims hate dogs.
Case closed
his subscription  notification or following whatever the hell it is having  some small lightnings around it has a whole new meaning now 😂😂
Won't be surprised if he plays the "It's AI" card.
Yep. Probably a toy.
Hassan has entered lolcow status for me
WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT AHAHAHHAHAHAHA
And the Left will still defend him only to protect themselves and the ideology they attach themselves to.
So we proved he's doing the thing we all knew he was doing. Shocking ..... to the dog unfortunately.
I can't believe the jews planted that remote on his desk!
Somebody please destroy him.
Hell is just forever, i hope he knows that
Even without the damming evidence, just how Hasan acts around his dog - he 100% abuses her. No decent dog owner tells their dog to stop being a baby when it yelps in pain.
Missa so sorri mi piker but the mike pencing has to stop the dog isnt gay this is unnecessary
He’s gonna shock his dog for not telling him the remote was in frame
Just look at the psycopathy... He fakes being interested in the donut box or whatever afterwards, actually believing he's throwing us off the trail.
"BOOM"
Training for aggressiveness in dogs sure. But "training" to keep this poor dog in place for hours for the stream... What a complete piece of shit
Someone needs to get that poor dog out of his life
1:20 Find me a lefty that will EVER admit that they are wrong, or takes accountability for anything they've done. That person does NOT exist.  Prove me wrong.
Me hiding porn when my mom walks in.
Hasanazi at it again
He really is sub 90 IQ, isn't he?
At this point, he should just say it was the remote for his buttplug. People would believe it.
Well at least more & more people are seeing commies are above rules & the law.
Glad that he got caught!   +Who the hell starts putting christmas decorations in OCTOBER???
Guys, clearly it’s Hasan’s vibrator remote!   Wait, does that sound better or worse?
That's what we call a narcissist.
Meanwhile, Dan Clancy: "Nothing to see here.  Pay no attention to what your eyes and ears tell you."
Let’s put it on him. Donos get to hit the juice!
0:19 when your mommy catches you in the cookie jar after bedtime
He was LYING?!🤥 noooooo way! Not the Palestine pro-Hamas supporter. Nooooooo wayyyyyyyy
Twitch: *"i'm gonna pretend i didn't see anything"*
LLLLLIAR
Buzzards flutter abouT
Are we really shocked about this or just the dog.
"oopsie poopsie"
Hassan is being genocided.  It's the Jews!  Where are the rioters?
FREE ALL DOGS FROM HASAN
shoutout to the dude who combed through hours of hell to find the clip
A terrorist abusing animals??… never would have thought I’d see the day. And the platform this freak streams on allows this to happen… what a shame
There is no justice this side of heaven.
Let's not forget that Kaya is being abused on a daily basis and the authorities are doing nothing. Twitch is doing nothing. His friends are defending him. Yet, if Asmon were to do this to an animal, all of the same people would be spending every waking moment talking about it.  Something has to change....
Remember the case of a 77 year old man KOd by a goat because he keep abusing it everytime until it decide "enough is enough"?  That will be Hasan future someday. Mammals are smart, they hold grudges. Even if it not Kaya, if Kaya is long gone, it successor will do the deed.
Is Hasan really that goddamn stupid?
Ladies and gentleman, ... WE GOT HIM!
His sneak level is pathetic
What an absolute moron. Hamas Piker’s downfall can’t come soon enough.
What a piece of crap. I said it once and I'll say it again....i smoke like a freight train...if i get diagnosed with incurable cancer, the dog will be freed by force. Im dying, i got nothing to lose.
BUSTED AND EXPOSED WHAT A RESTARTED AND RETARDED INDIVIDUAL HASAN PIKER IS! LMAO! WHAT AN INBRED RETARD
The State needs to liberate that dog
The self own...you can't make this shit up
Oh and his fans will still find a way to defend this, smh
BECAUSE HE IS A NARCISSIST
He wants us to know
GUYS DO NOT LET THIS BLOW OVER THATS WHAT HASAN AND POKIMANE WANT NEVER FORGET 🗣️
He can't be this stupid
Put him and his fans in a Battle Royale in the Gulag
He'll just say it's a similar remote for the "vibrating" model, or that its an old remote for a collar he had ages ago etc. That and even though we all know it is the remote for the shock collar, having it on the desk still isn't absolute definitive proof that he shocked his dog in the original clip.
This is going to be a shocking Christmas event.
He's just a scumbag
So are the police going to do anything? This is animal abuse... on camera
So now the supporters will go from denying it happened, to saying there’s nothing wrong with it.
Someone post his address online so we can go knock his fucking teeth out
I feel like this is some crazy distraction ploy…he’s gonna run out of content without the Israel thing so now he’s gonna stay relevantly hinting that he shocks his dog
That dog is a national hero for taking down Hassan ayye 👏👏
I am not shocked by this revelation. Not as shocked as Hasan's dog.
What a terrible person
This is deeply shocking and disturbing, I cant believe Hamas would do something like this. Oh wait yes I can.
Ladies and Gentlemen: We got 'im
Annnnnnnnndddddddd he's fuck!
6 min ago and 8000 views
The autists on the internet work better and quicker than our FBI
Where's PETA!!!!
dont worry his community will make up new excuses they got him cover lol
I’ve never had to use a shock collar on a dog I raised. But my brother in laws 120 pound white retriever has an issue with barking at night when you let him out. Long story short, he came over with a bark collar on. And I removed it. And set it next to my tv. A few hours later. He barked at a passerby, and the shock collar activated. Into my tv. Yep that turned out great. 😂
bruh how many times has it been over so far?
Guys it’s out of context! His haters put it there! What about the farmers in Belarus!
This dude needs to get cancelled. There's enough proof.
Hilarious 😂
Hasan Palpatine Piker
He would drop nukes on people like rice at a wedding if he could do it by pressing a button
amazing
Playing Among Us and self reporting thinking its a good strat.
That wasn't the 2nd Tower That was His Damn Pentagon! What a *LOSER!*
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
this has to be the worst handled controversy of all time.
And nothing will happen to this Caviar Communist. Let it go already. Let him have his echo chamber of simps.
He’s more cooked than Vader on Mustafar.
I’m not shocked to see it. The dog is.
from the fence to the tree kaya will be free!
His dickriders will still deny it because they need their mascot against the right wing chuds
Even if Asmon did this to his dog I’d say the same thing. I’d like to think most of us would.  Yet Hasan viewers will defend animal mistreatment just because he pretends to be some mentally ill extremist
He’s such a damn liar 😂 Hamas Palpatine Piker ain’t beating the allegations
He's such a monumental piece of shit.
JAIL hassan for dog abuse
People need to remind others that the platform - name it - supports abuse of animals
Its the new AI cup coaster prototype out of Japan set for release in 2030, he isnt allowed to reveal it yet...
It's actually never over ...
Can someone just kick Hasan's ass already? He's never going to learn. Not in public obviously. All Batman style (Arkham Origins version).
you're a cool dude I never understood how you hung around all these fucking idiots dude Hassan's a complete trailer trash wreck bro that guy's he's a lost cause dude that guy is nothing but anti-American everything you shouldn't even fucking be in this country in my opinion mischief and a lot of those people Pokemon they're all bunch of immature adolescents I think that they're smart because they've been on YouTube for so long that they make a bunch of money from fucking degenerates
If Hasan cant already get any worse
Who let the dogs out
What he would say is "Does this make your life better?" to deflect.  Karma always gets back at you.
what a dingus, this guy
Pikachu just can't stop 😅
I LOVE seein him SQUIRM!
Hes just like a Palestinian. Get caught over and over causing sh1t to other people around you and then pretend it never happens and everyone should feel sorry for you. ps. Why the actual fuk does Hasan put up a Christmas tree in the first place, does he actually do anything on all spectrums just for views ? Does he at all believe in anything himself other than making money from whoever is stupid enough to support him ?
Why'd he lie about torturing the dog? It's his culture
“Can’t believe Asmon put that on my desk just to spread far right propaganda against me” - Hasan
Anotha clip has shocked us all as Kaya. Poor dog i hope she gets taken away from this psychopath who isn't used for a prop. Piker is lucky characters like Light Yagami, Frank Castle and John Wick are fiction
The amount of lies from Hasan is  absurd
Poor fucking dog man..
Ah so the thing that everyone could see in plain sight has now been further proven again? I don't know how anyone sees the original clip and thinks "yeah the dog probably hurt her paw on nothing. Yelped because of a phantom pain in her dew claw. Makes perfect sense!" The best part is that everyone who ran defense for Hasan (Pokimane, Ludwig, Philip Defranco, etc.) are now shown as the disingenuous liars that we always knew they were.
Self report.
Anyone that defends Hassan needs to be reminded about how much he will lie over these small things.  Drill it into their heads, people.  Dismiss anything they say to their face and remind them they are listening to a liar.
Can we just Ship off Hassan to the Houthies? that way he get 10 toes down, Hopefully they would use him as front line, and then the problem would just work itself out.
Poor dog. :( He needs to give her up for adoption. What a savage.
Oh, the camera’s on… the camera’s been on the whole time!
From the stream room to the fence line Kaya will be free!
As if you couldn’t hate this guy enough omg I can’t even imagine how he’ll spin this but I’m glad
Bet Hasan Piker will cry to his daddy that everyone is mean to him for hurting the dog.
If PETA weren't corrupt, they would go after him....they might want a donation😅
What’s crazy is that it could be A.I. and it wouldn’t matter. Everybody is cooked.
All jokes aside, hope that the dog is eventually out of this not-a-home.   Edit:  I like dogs. I don't like Hassan. Take a minute to reflect on that before dying to fall damage by jumping to your own conclusion. :D
( . Y . )
Anyone know if this is an old clip? Or is he just very excited for Christmas?
So if the streaming services don't ban hamas piker, does that mean they support animal abuse?
That's just the remote for his vibrator he uses for chess you know, that's why he's so stuck up all the time.
If this man is in court I don’t think his is gonna hold up at all
F that guy. Poor dog
Omg
Of course all the woke retards are sticking up for each other
He is going to get so pissed off at you he will do bodily harm. That is what theses wacked out progressive, democrat left wing nuts will do to satisfy their lust for vengeance.  Watch out!
these overreactions are ridiculous. EVERYBODY can see this is just the remote for Hassan's VIBRATOR he's using on his own AHH not some shock collar. JEEZ ppl sumtimes
Hasan - BRO WHAT ABOUT PALESTINEEEEEE
This fucking idiot. It keeps getting worse for him and yet, he’ll keep lying. He’s a lolcow.
Oh no 💀
I hope Hasan saved and invested wisely. I think his employment situation just got real sketch 😂
Its funny how people are so often their own undoing.
just keep going, eventually meatcanyon will make a video about it just like they did with PS xD
It shows he is 100% a liar, and he knows his sheep audience is stupid enough to believe him.
LOL
Now he can’t claim it’s Israeli propaganda 😂
Presumably openly abusing an animal on stream would be grounds for serious intervention?  Imagine someone liked Hamas Diddy Bin Laden Piker faced consequences.
hahahahahaha that little b*tch
He’s cooked. Game over man, game over!
We have finally solved the case!!!!         For the 10th time
Save that poor dog. Someone. Plssss.
This is shocking news.
B-b but Palestine....
It’s the remote for his vibrating dildo.
Israeli Jewish Dog maybe?
I wonder how his mindless drone followers are going to spin it.
Orbiters are gonna say they're car keys and he's just moving it away so he can reach the donut.
I still can't get over the fact that asmon treats roaches he just met better than Hasan treats his own dog.
1:02 I thought surely Hasan was at least smart enough to keep it out of frame, but BRO IT IS LITERALLY 1-TO-1.
Thats his I love the Jews pledge pin.
At this point keep talking abouth this guy (hasan) is not worth it. Twitch dosent give a shit about and wont do nothing and thats the only thing that will actually affect him
100% COOKED
Hasan Piker: *shocks dog*  Also Hasan Piker: "Somehow Asmongold is behind all this! I just can't prove it!"
No hiding now
Hasanabi is a psychopath
This is truely shocking news
Obvious truth we all knew from the start. Now they'll move on to saying, "Maybe it happens, but here's why it's a good thing."
SHOCKING REVELATION
caught in 4k. gotcha witch.
00:20 that look man. Someone has got to meme it
Bro I’m not even a subscriber of this guy but Hasan is a fucking moron oh my god 😭
The look at the camera...
Narcissists are individuals with a personality disorder characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy. They typically struggle to admit their wrongs due to their fragile ego and fear of losing their perceived superiority.  -definition of a Narcissist
I’m going to enjoy how the cultists rewrite the narrative on this one
How do people discover this tho... Some poor  soul sits 24/7 there and watches old Hassan stream vods...
I feel at this point he is just testing how far he can go
that's officially proof. what else do people need? he clearly mistreated his dog
Now he’s actually done
Hasan lies? Nooooooooooo.
Poor dog. Lol😂 Hassan is stupid he's so guilty of shocking that poor dog
He will never escape this lol
Hasan’s an overt narcissist.
The last shock has been shocked
Hasan Piker: "STOP MOCKING ME! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!"  Everyone: "Because it's easy and it does a lot of damage."
Ggs chat
My god! Just my god! He tried hiding it on stream completely visible. Hes torturing his dog because it doesnt want to be a prop!
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him.
I wonder how many people did the old zoom and enhance already.
Is anyone shocked that the pathological liar was in fact lying
Hasan is finally going to be brought down by a dog 🤣🤣🤣
Caught
Can't wait to see him try and talk his way out of this one 🍿
He's a real pos.
Hasan and PirateSoftware need to collab
⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Bros a terrorist and animal abuser go figure.
at this stage he wants to be caught
More Pegasus GET ON IT
Hasan Piker trying to save face after being exposed of shocking Kaya the Wonder Dog.
The shock collar is the friends we made along the way
If he can do that to animals, he will do it to a human if he had the opportunity. I knew it, I just cant prove it (yet)
Must be the remote for the shortcut for Asmon's videos he likes, not his dog's collar
First! Youre gay!
Mostly "Peaceful" Electricity
Boom! We got him! 😂😂😂
Anyone else getting tired of these stupid click bait titles "it's over" or "100% cooked this time" after 100 other videos saying the same thing 🤡
I feel bad for the dog. Nothing deserves to be shocked and tortured like how Hasan treats his pets.
I support postbirth abortion for Hassan
You can see the shock on his face.
ok yea he tortured that dog
Can it actually be over? My heart can only take so much...
guy just invented a new form of animal abuse
He has the dogs collar on speed dial.
His hand got caught in the cookie jar
😮
How is it news he's a POS? He openly called for people's murder... I'm glad the dog is still alive tbh
what a guy hasan so insecure i wonder why he lies about such stuff can't take this guy serious at all
This is literally a “smoking” gun.
Under five minutes crew
Will they at least kick him off the platform for animal abuse?
😂😂😂
It’ll only be over if Twitch perma bans him
Sooner or later, everyone is going to see how much a lunatic Hassan is. More importantly, insane. And if that dog dies, all hell is going to break loose.
Kekw
Shocking 😲
Cue the price is right losing sound
❤️🤍💙 red, white, blue, I love you
Damn im early
Another plane has hit the tower hahahah!!!
WOW... JUST WOW!!
Mr. President, a second shock has hit the dog.
Happy Birthday Dear Thor…
Who could have guessed...?
That is just sad...
It's OVER
I really love asmongold but no one will see this
STOP THE DAMN MATCH!
Maybe this guys editors are the same editors for Pegasus
First
Oh no
Jay from ninjago been real quiet since this one dropped
Poor dog...
Euthanasia please.
Send this dude to the gulag
Again
