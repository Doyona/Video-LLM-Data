Was für ein toller Angel ❤❤🪽🪽
A series called Ajal Moalagh  starring Reza Attaran has been made that is very similar to the subject of this film.
Is he an Iranian director?
I don't agree actor's should make fun of angels, angels are serious no time for joking around about ALMIGHTY GOD'S ANGEL'S, this is a sin think whatever you want it's a sinful movie
Keanu🌺I can’t wait to see your new angel 😇 movie 🎥 💥love you baby💋. KellyElizabeth.
Epe nice
I think I like that role for Keanu Reeves....he should do more stuff I feel he is very talented man..... People could learn from him if they open their hearts and minds
John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogan? Count me in
Angel Gabriel figures out that money DOES buy happiness😂😂😂 Can not wait!!!
This was a great movie. I love the reality of it all. It’s up vs. down for real!
The good old titan dogpile precision
I'm in
So its family man meets prince and the pauper
Yes, I truly do like you because you're one of the only actors out there with any true sense!
Fabulously fun ❤
You are such a lovely person & have all the money in the world. So why would you & your management scam little me out of $48,000 after I have been so kind to you & U were my Emperor & I was your Empress. Is there no goodness in this world??? And I thought you were such a good person. You got me good. Is this what happens to all big stars. It makes me so sad.
Gabriel comes to announce the holy heirs & tell the good news it's his purpose 📜🪽
Donkey Kong, Ming Lee, Ramona and Shadow the Hedgehog
Not the Constantine sequel I was expecting…
Keanu, a rare good human being in Hollywood.
I Was Returned By Death

Thank you so much ❤🎉Good fortune 🔮
Do not watch this blasphemous movie if you are a follower of JESUS.  I’m so disgusted with industries and people mocking GOD.  GOD will not be mock.  Every knee will bow professing Christ JESUS is LORD!!!
Yeah dogshit.   Like.. don't need a explanation.
Look like Hollywood is telling you to worship money, nothing new under the sun.
Answer with All Things…
Keanu’s Not Telling Us Something At This Point…
Rogan and Ansari are gonna bring this movie down... they arent funny
Comedy 🎭 gold
Winston: what have you done, Jonathan.
Misha Collins called he wants his coat back. Lol
This movie looks great!! Been a while since I found a Keanu Reeves movie that I’ve wanted to see. Love him but John wick was NOT for me lol
Cannot wait to see this!
John Wick 5 John comes back as an Angel
Keanu Reeves was the first star seed on earth.
there are so many bots in the chat
Omfg KEANU!!!!! lol
Oh this is the bill Murray movie that got him cancelled (kinda)
Looks like a dang good comedy! Can’t wait! BTW, Aziz got some moves at 1:57
Looks pretty funny
This looks truly awful. Real "Stop or my Mom will Shoot" level. Keanu save yourself first.
Who wouldn't love an *Angel* like Keanu Reeves?! (He is one, for sure!) 😇 LPeaceM
When you've been waiting 20 years for the Constantine sequel, only to cut to Keanu Reaves as an angel in 2025...
Looks terrible. I'm in.
I do firmly believe Keanu Reeves is an actual Angel & for that reason am in.
Oh Second : i know Why every Demon, Satan or The Devil is a Male - Except for 1 - Lilith.  If you want i can explain.. takes a few lines of words. But it's a real reason.. THERE ARE NO FEMALE DEVIL.. LILITH IS THE ONLY ONE.
У Индусов есть Ангелы? Они же верят в перерождение.
self made "my parents are rich"
I’m big not into comedies but I’m going to see this! The trailer had me laughing out loud in the theater.
You guy's need to stop looking at this flim so much as a comedy and real life i don't care it's a movie we suffer so they can be happy
wait, KEANU SOUNDS LIKE G-MAN !!!
he doesnt fit, but thats ok
❤
Perfect movie for Christmas.
I'm loving this !
Looks ass. Can he ever speak like he is not stoned out of his mind?
Keanu's character's apperance HAS to be inspired by Castiel in Supernatural. Like c'mon it's literally his outfit lol
Dang, Gabriel out there being breathtaking
Mr. Constantine..?
Corazón disculpa te estaba borrando pensé. Que estaba. Metida ronpiendo algo y no es así eres libre y te amo
Aziz living the Haram life 100%.
It is a shame that Seth Rogen is such a piece of shit irl.. Makes it hard for me to look forward to this movie. :P
Hello Mr Keanu reeves ❤I'm from Tehran city ,you're just my friend in my dreams , just you're my heart in the world,  I very need to you please massage to me I love you of 1999 antil now in matrix , I see photos characters matrix break my heart,please  help me neo just a massage to me ,I need to you many out have biggest heart in the word ,of 26 years ago I,m love you and trinity I hold you my nearest my beat friend, answer me please Mr Keanu reeves help me Mr neo😢😢😢❤❤❤
Looks good
this is looking like a shit ass movie and thats only because of seth and aziz. Keanu is gonna need to carry this dump of a freaky friday male edition
This is going to be a fun movie
close enough welcome back John Constantine
I thought this was an interesting concept, and then Seth Rogan, possibly the least funny Canadian ever, and his usual level of douchebaggery.   That's going to be a hard pass.
Imagine casting seth Rogan in 2025 tf
MORE GARBAGE!
He really an Arch Angel VIP with himself looking forward to John Constantine 2 & more flims ?!  😊😮🎉😂❤
keanu trny steal castiels angelic sytle lmao
Jonny Sliverhand was an angel basically lol
-Wait, you are telling me I have a budget guardian angel?!  -It seemed to have solved most of  his problems. - I came from nothing, I'm self-maid 😂😂.  -Give me God. I wanna a minute with God.
順便一提，這狸貓責編 也負責過咒術 但那隻只有一隻眼睛的貓，明顯不太聽他的話
Seth rogen*
crap.
Posers
Happy Birthday!
This will be a AWESOME movie, but I didn’t know John wick passed away 😂😂😂😂
Why is Keanu doing anything movie with Seth Rogan???? He's part of the problem too. Seth is for the liberal and democratic party hard. I guess even Keanu has to make money. Handing out awards is different, at least he stood his ground to Whoopie Goldberg.
his angel wings are too cute
Happy birthday 🎈🎊🎉🎁 enjoy your day.
Tbh, Keanu is literally an angel. "I'm an angel, see the wings?" truest sentence ever said. please continue being you, Keanu.
I'm going to see this ASAP 😅
Ew, Seth Rogen 🤮
Real angel in disguise❤❤
It looks like a good fun film but you've told us the bloody story already.
Indian Filthy Pajeet!
Glad to see Kevin come back as a Angel and not a Devil like his dad
"Get me a meeting with God"  "God its Jeff"
Supernatural summed up
seth rogan is insufferable, i know he has some fans but god i cant watch anything with him in it anymore... he is so annoying and just not funny..  comes off as a cringey hollywood weirdo.
They spelled Seth Rogen wrong lol
From Constantine to Gabriel
After trying to burn Arasaka and failed now he just want to help other.
i tho he's Jesus
I love it it's a good movie I laough so hard I was crying
Am I the only one that thinks the voices sound ai
Bro went from killing an entire hotel full of people , to Saving lives
Bro, this movie seems "funny" but portraying Angel Gabriel like this ain't right. Down right blasphemous tbh.
I KNEW YOU ARE AN ANGEL!!!!!! I can't wait to see that one !!!! 🤗 God bless you and your family and this beautiful day!!!!!! 😇💜
I can feel a 6 coming for imdb.
So this is Trading Places vs. Wings of Desire.
This trailer sucks, but I most likely gonna watch the movie anyways cause of Keanu Reeves 😅
that's a documentary of Keanu, not a film
shame
I've never been a big aziz ansari fan but this seems like it will be really good
Wait a second that's not John Constantine!
Keanu is probably the only A-Lister who could still appreciate how humble circumstances lead to humility.
Earth Angel <3
Top Tier Cast !!
lets see if Keeanu's charm can cancel out Aziz and Seth's terrible acting
this movie seems funny because the indian guy got riched using a scam, just like irl
ok, i'm interested.
Seth Rogan always plays the same guy 😅
Straight up mocking us 💀 yea I like Keanu reeves but straight up mocking the world right now
Song:  Patrick Cowley, Sylvester - Do you wanna Funk?
Damn didnt expect a John Wick sequel this fast
This movie is actually brilliant
This looks like one of my deep dreams when I sleep with they windows closed. I love Keanu.
he got that castiel drip
Keanu looks more like John Wick than angel 😇
"Trading Places" since 1983.
I think I'm gonna love it
idk why but keanu somehow fits perfectly for this role
It's going to be an average movie I guess. Trailer is not so good
Seems like another liberal wor is me i had a bad start in life my parents werent rich
This reminds me of Bruce and Evan Almighty
Whhaaaaat lol
Oh man, I haven’t listened to Sylvester in a minute. Lol.
💖   💖   💖
EPIC, one of the few who still put out and gives us a goodies. Bless your hearts gentleman.
so john wick became an angel after death.
holy fuckin peak
Gabriel A.S is in Arabic we muslim call Jibrael peace be upon him.
Why is the acting so choppy
Sry i dont hate kianu but, this is fkng blasphemous 😡
As an angel, he makes a good hitman.
saw seth rogan and i know to stay away from this movie
*wipes sugar from nose* "okay so what if we make a movie about a guardian angel and he's played by Keanu Reeves!"
This movie looks epic! Can not wait to see it! 😃
THIS LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING I NEED TO SEE THIS
I was hoping to see the famous pencil move 😂
odd the mane who played John Constantine plays an angel... and also odd the "Archangel" Gabriel is a low tier angel??? I need explanations so I guess I gotta see this now
Keanu is a bad actor that just stumbles into really good movies.
Prequal to his role in Spongbob Movie.
That dudes whiney voice ruins this movie
Good to see Aziz back in the saddle
waiting for Constantine 2 and get this! xD
Aziz is back!!!
If Seth Rogan is in it I’ll pass dude fell off  10 years ago
Exciting
Constantine took gabriel's spot!
So John Wick became an angel  Well yeah money solves most of our problems 🤣
this feels like that moment my english teacher told me "Borat is more than just a guy being weird",
Hollywood should ban this weed fanatic Rogan away. Or put 1 mil tax for every weed positive comment.
" i tried to show him wealth wouldn't solve all his problems.   And?   It seems to have solved most of his problems"  LMAO 😂  I need a John Wick angel in my life
1:13 true for most of us 😂
What's the premise? Keanu playing himself while wear angel wings. What else? Deadpan humor. Sold. 😂
I grew up with keano being a goofy bastard so this seems much more fitting then john wick hahah i couldnt bring myself to watch it no offense or mothing people hahah
ew seth rogan
Is it just me or Keanu Reeves really lost his acting skills in this one? It seemed more of a newbie actor. Weird.
The song at 1:15 is the same song in Trading Places when Eddie Murphy has a party at his newly acquired place.
Jesus???!!!!
There will be many „good” people in hell. But God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him, shall be saved!  Are you whosoever?! Believe in Yeshua as your Messiah, so you and your household may be saved!  God bless ❤
It's not Oh My God, It's Oh My Gosh
"God, it's Jeff"
omgomgomg
why does this man choose to star in some of the cringest randomest movies ever made? he is in fact a real angel though
lol)
man the constantine sequel looking really different
Again, great. We got white guy losing everything and some outsider gaining everything and the moral of the story is "THIS IS GOOD". Amazing story-writing, almost as if there was something to indoctrinate us to
Seth Rogan was ok with censoring comics during the covid hoax. Hopefully, that means something to people.
Indians infiltrating Hollywood WoW
Now all we need is a puppy to spice things up!!
seems like good movie
Keanu was the perfect choice for this film. The man is an angel in real life. He’s charitable, down to earth, has shown great kindness to homeless people, and even lets elderly women take his seat when he rides the bus.
Archangel John Wick.
John Travolta Michael vibes anyone
From being a serious "Three Gun" tactical shooter to doing something this outre'?   You gotta love him.
when does the shooting start, I am so confused. Where is that dead dog?!
0:45 never gets old 😅
the closest we have for john constantine?
LOOKS FUNNY
John Malkovich vibes from Keanu here lol
These guys are trading places and the trailer has the disco song from Trading Places in it.
What a nerf
"It seems to have solved most of his problems" was delivered in such a John Malkovich cadence
What's the first background song called?
Is it AI generated??😅
Wait I'm confused. Is this a game or is ut a movie?
Omg Keanu 😂  Can't wait for that one!
Glorifying MONEY!
Keanu Reeves might be the worst popular actor in history.
The babayaga died and now he is an angel.
No wonder they look like Fallen angels when the movie is coming out this Fall.
Seth Rogen typo in the title
This is Cyberpunk plot where Johnny Silverhand actually saves the protagonist 😂
I tried to show him that wealth wouldn’t solve all his problems. And? It seems to have solved most of his problems.  😂 🫡
Im watching this in theater mad stoned.
John Wick on his life: "Anger, Vengeance, Killing, Brutal."  John Wick after death :
Keanu Reeves is Jesus Christ
Gabriel the archangel and general in zuses armies. Along side The archangel Michael
stop mpcking God. He does not take insult lightly
"I tried to show him that wealth wouldn't solve all his problems" "It seems to have solved most of his problems"  I'm dead XD
John Wick going to heaven to meet his dog again, only to come down as an angel:
Keanu can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but we still love him 😂  I mean, seriously, he sounds like a bad ai line reading.
Keanu Reaves is indeed an angel. We know that already ❤
Is it Angel-A with Keanu?
Guys this is fake trailer.
I Wan't To See Him In Constantine John Again..
ok i wont lie, this looks so good.
GOOD MOVIE INCOMING
ARE YOU ALL OKAY WITH THIS???   IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE RELIGIOUS OR NOT, AND I KNOW KEANU IS A GOOD GUY..  BUT THIS MOVIE IS MOCKING THE ARCH ANGEL GABRIEL, THAT IS NOT OKAY.
Hello
Yes I agree. He's an Angel. And he's here to save all of us.
I thought bro supposed to be in hell
Okay, I know we needed a remake of Trading Places, but..
Bro has the Castiel fit on
why is keanu so robotic now
This looks awesome😇
this may be the most peak trio cast in the last few years. I'm so excited for this
Jesus Wick on the mission
I don't believe John Wick is doing this!!!!
Does anybody know the name/artist of the disco song being played at 1:40??
Why did Keanu make this movie when he could have been making a new Constantine movie!
Hey guys chill he is not real keannu it is AI generated version of him this movie is AI generated dont worry our john wick willcome back in JW 5
I'd love to see this lol
Don't destroy it's character.
No wonder its funny plus clean writer is Aziz Ansari just read it, his head not full of ...trash.Instantly you notice its clean.
Don't know what to say but after a very long time a Hollywood movie that makes you smile.Script is funny and clean at least in the trailer. Maybe not called him Gabriel like" it's a beautiful life movie" an angel  was enough .But it's funny the trailer.
retired assassin, become an angel
Mr. Wick ....enjoying Retirement life...!!!
Johny angel
constantine 3
nah bruh i aint buy
He doesn't take the beard off, he looks like john wick
all great actors in this one. Also this is like a current age johhny silverhand if you think about it lol
its a detox activity for John wick after 4 parts of being deportation angel
johnny silverhand irl
I am greatly looking forward to seeing this. All 3 of them look like they are going to be genuinely funny together.
so Aziz Ansari is the lead, and Keanu Reeves is the supporting actor. Okay....
This trailer made me smile automatically from the very beginning, just by thinking such a chill dude like Keanu is playing in this, again in a kinda   *excellent* role ! 🗣️🤍
Why? What happens with the world today?
this actually looks hilarious
Plot Twist: This is a new John Wick Movie
Plot twist: the entire movie budget went into this scene’s charisma boost of the Brilliant Keanu Reeves and it was worth every cent 😂
Shadow the hedgehog in good fortune keanu reeves is so kind
"I tried to show him that wealth wouldn't fix all his problems!" "And?" "It seems to have solved most of his problems"
Will be waiting for this ♥️
I thought they wrote good Fortnite
高貴美麗的靈魂❤
❤❤❤❤From Denmark ❤❤❤❤
Ooh, Trading Places meets Michael. Here for it.
what the shit is this Keanu Reeves as angle WTF.
Unfortunately Seth Rogen is in this
This Cyberpunk 2077 mod is wird
Keanu Reeves playing John Malkovich playing Gabriel.
This video makes me want to watch more actors doing movie trailers of movies that shouldn't be made.
So Constantine and Gabriel switched roles?
Bruce Almighty basically.
funny story about guy from the boat? omg...
Keanu is a real 😇❤
Easy way to go to hell Insult God and his angels  Stop it or you are doomed
is that a low budget constantine 2  ! hhh
i love it😅👊🏼❤️
Aziz Ansari will ruin this movie for me I already know. He's ok for sitcoms, but he's too trash an actor for a movie
An other stupid scenario . They did it already in 1996 with Travolta MICHAEL .
1:10 THE ANSWER WE NEEDED
wtf is this shit
looks like ass tbh
money can solve everything
Trailer is exactly 2:22 which is an Angel Number... I see what you did here.
Looks like Johnny Silverhand has decided to start doing good
Aziz is back. Good times
the constantine sequel
awe you are my angel sent from heaven❤❤❤😊
I might actually go into the theater to see this
Keanu the goat. This looks pretty funny too haha
This movie is a big BIG insult to the angel Gabriel and angels in general.
So happy Aziz is back!!!
The switch up reminded me a bit of the movie Trading Places from 1983
Would this be a goofier version of “City of Angels”?
The fun is, that Keanu ONLY plays himself
Fear and Loathing in Heaven
As much as I like keenau i'll pass Seth Rogan plays the same character every movie since pineapple express.
seth rogan the little kamala loving liberal. funny, cause kamala would have put him in jail for his consume
Now i believe John Wick truly died in JW4 and he became an angel😂
so he is playing himself
Not watching this, he is an Israeli supporter.
I thought this was Constantine through the multiverse xD
This is not a movie, it is a documentary on Keanu Reeves
Glad to see Aziz Ansari back after that fraudalent metoo bitch tried to take him down over bold faced lie
Constantine got a promotion huh 😂
I’m so happy that after John Wick 4, he became an angel ❤
I guess i can imagine Keanu Reeves as angel ,he looks like someone who can do damage to demons
lol looks hilarious
I love this so much cant wait
Fvck yeah money can solve almost everything
Konstantin what are you going?
Angel who can kill 3 people with a f%$king pencile
The G.O.A.T.
Love it ,greatest cast 😂
Seth ROG DESPERATE to get back his once star status - wish KR would have refused assistance
DESPISE SETH ugh RUIN MOVIE - hIS  time is UP
hopefully Seth Rogan doesnt ruin this movie. as he gets older his movies are traaaaaashhhhh
this look like shit
This is an example for the Indonesian kid who say Hidup sebagai perintis itu seru
it’s penguinz0
Reeves can't act for shit.
I love his cute wings
imo, they should've dyed keanu hair and beard white or grey lol but i love that he's doing comedy again
This is hilarious 😂
How did they get an original script made in hollywood? Or is this based on some previous movie that doesn't come to mind?
John wick doing side quest
Yikes movies suck now
Sooo cute wings😊
who is aziz ansari
Keanu is truly an angel ! He is so special
I am eagerly waiting to see the fantastic actors performance .
John wick got nerfed
Did he just drive Jhonny 911 turbo porche?
1:10 Cyberpunk 2077 reference???
The cigarettes are a subtle nod to this being a Constantine prequel
Seth Rogan?? I’m out.
So that's what happened to Johnny Silverhand. 😂
Keannu is a legit angel anyways. No need to make a movie about him being one.
Well, budget angel is real, they couldn't afford some good wings after casting Keanu Reeves 😂😂
0:41 Well well well...guess who retired and not "hunting" this time 😂😂. It's kinda ironic to see john wick as a guardian.
Gabriel : Yeah, consequences~
Holy Jeffff
An actually good Seth Rogen movie. Lol.
its like takopi
LOL
why does every voice seems like bullshit? lol
Keaanu can really light up any role He is in .
Thought this was ai movie trailer. Found out it was a real shit 😯🤯
It's like a parody of it's a wonderful life.
This is Keanu's next franchise.  Good Fortune's Excellent Adventure, Good Fortune Parabellum, and maybe 18 years later, Good Fortune Resurrections.
John constantine retribution 😂
Yes, we need more good comedy movies please!
Well, I have already seen the movie in the trailer
Looks dumb.
If you knew about JIbrael !!!!
This movie is filmed in India?😂
No Angel come to give me sucess staffs like Keanu Reeves  😂😂
Owh... this is John Wick retired activities
I prefer him to fight for justice, rather.
This movie probably wont be great, but ill watch it for Keanu
Come on Keanu you did a goofy movie with those losers 🤦‍♂️
Hell yesss! 🫶
Wylitha lane It's the most richest house woman in the world.Kansas is my brother biology
Hollywood’s politics/leftist politics is a reason our economy is tanked. This looks so lame.
Keanu reeves  and Seth Rogen deadly new combination......
I can't take Keanu Reeves being in a comedy movie seriously.
At 1:10 is that the Porsche 911 that was featured in cyberpunk?? I have the freakin hot wheels of this car
I like Keanu but he can't act and it's showing in this trailer.
Your an Angel? Yeah right Mr. Wick.. The Angel of Death!
Man I hope he continues to make awesome movies throughout his life. And also Constantine 2.
I reeved my self since no one else would do it :) i love me, maybe reeves is the loml,  but he just looks like mark, oh well, Reeves
No. Constantine cannot be Gabriel. Full stop.
Keanu straight up looking like Castiel
Really Constantine? REALLY?!
This is all we get from Aziz after all these years?!? I want him to do standup again
Keanu looks happy bro and I’m all for it! 😊
they mispelled seth rogen's name holy shit at first i tought the universe was goin mandela on me
I don’t like Seth Rogan but I’ll watch it because of Keanu Reeves.
As soon as I heard Seth Rogen's annoying laughter, I knew I was not gonna see it
He is an angel with small wings 😂❤😇💯💕🙏💕🇭🇷👋🧑‍🦽
Why do they sound so weird..?
The Angel of focus, commitment and sheer will. 😂
Jhon Wich reincarnation to be an Angel
Did I see a Johnny silverhand porsche?
Meh, Aziz isn't really that funny.
My reaction: Keanu - yaaaay !!! 😁 Seth Rogan - oooops, I think I'll pass on this one. 😥
KR: I tried to show him that wealth wouldn't solve all of his problems SO: And... KR: It solved most of his problems  I spat🤣🤣
HE HAVE A OTHER FACE HE IS JOHN WICK.. 0:07🔥
What is Tom Haverford up to
What a mess! They make Keanu dirty. No No.  my favorite actor 😭
Had me at Seth Roger laugh.
Pretty sure that all the director told Keanu was to act like Keanu. Wings grew on their own.
You know what they say about having small wings. 😇😇😇
At first, I thought this was the trailer for Constantine 2. 😀
Baba Yaga as an Angel, Can't wait to see that ❤
Imagine Keanu and Seth getting high together
Is it just me? Or does some scenes looks like AI? Especially the first few
❤❤ это, наверное, классный фильм, я так хочу его посмотреть. 💋🔥💯
This looks like a SNL-Skit... but not a good one.
Bro was a deadly Hit Man before coming to Night CIty to stay in a random guy's brain and now become an Angel. Got it.
SILVERHANDS  911 !!!!!
This is just Keanu’s actual life… not a movie trailer
Is that Azealia Banks???😂
John Wick after death 😂😂
Money can definitely solve my problems lol
well at least this time Keanu charachter NOT name JOHN, Constantine, Wick nor Silverhand.
Really looks cute can't wait to see it
Keanu Reeves playing an angel sent from heaven? Must be his autobiography
Wow, you just saved me having to go to the theater.  Looks terrible.
I thought Aziz was cancelled?
The Keanu Friend group of actors starts reading Discworld...
now this is a shit that role is not for an one man army  we need JOHN WICK
it like the inverted john wick, once a rich and dangerous stone hard killer turned into a budget life saving angel
To the one who's reading this, always know that your life has a great purpose and you're not useless! You are loved!  You'll know it soon as you start a relationship with Him-- the One loves you the most. 💘  We may be sinners and are deserving to pay for it, but thanks to the Lord! He offered His life on the cross to pay for our sins. We may know that, but not the implication in our life, here is what it is: You and I broke God's commands, but it is Jesus who paid the fine-- that's what happened in the cross.  God loves you deeply that He doesn't want to be separated with you. He offered His life to save you! He wants to give you life! ✨  The only thing we have to do is turn away from sin and trust in Jesus as  our Savior, following Him as Lord in our lives. He will forgive us, repair our broken relationship with Him, and we will have eternal life.  Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. -John 14:6  How are you? Do you have a relationship with Jesus? Start it now! ❤️  Read the Bible and know God more (preferably starting with book of John and Romans), pray, and go to a Bible-centered church!
potti
Waiting for release.
Angel Wick ~
i hope he change the hairstyle cause all i see is john wick😂😂
I LOVE this trailer!!  Can't WAIT to see it -- Keanu Reeves not only IS a REAL life angel, but looks to be a hilarious one in this film!! :-)
When the trailer started I thought I wouldn't watch this.. but by the time it ended I'm definitely watching this 🤣
This is actually looks really fun!
This reminds me of late 90s / early 2000s films.
"We want Constantine 2!" "We have Constantine 2 at home." *Constantine 2 at home*
I Need This😂
Treat yo’self…!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is John Wick chapters 6    he became an angel😄
Give Keanu the oscar right now
Beautiful movie
Thanks for your love and support ❤
I don't want to believe this is John Wick 5 meets Constantine 2 😂😂😂😂😂
Keanu is not born for this kind of roles
can't wat for this one
This resonates so much with Keanu Reeves. Love!
cant wait lol
lame
Others after blockbuster>>blockbuster  Keanu reeves after blockbuster>>shitbuster😅
hollywood oh my god
Talk about the bogieman 😂
They actually hired Jesus!!
Angel Gabriel ❌ Constantine ✅
Worst seth laugh yet wow
Keanu reeves would make a really good jesus 😂
I feel people forget Keanu Reeves is actually funny
This is what John Constantine do after he was sacrificed him self and become an angel.
Don't be fooled he can still kill u with a fckn pencil
original, i like it <3
meh
Unpopular opinion/hot take - i really like Keanu and the movies he stars in, but i think he is a really really bad actor
Angels always come in with their own angles😶‍🌫️🥧
Man before I commented, youtube suggested me to be respectful. Like hell I am gonna say anything bad to the kindest person on Hollywood.         Not at all because I think john wick here can beat the shit out of me😂
became angel 😇  after death
Angel john fans
This is what constantine do in his spare time
Keanu acting on another level. Comes off as dry and awkward but hilarious.
I like this
Did Keanu just come out as an angel?
This is like Trading Places meets Its A Wonderful Life. 😂
Seth Rogan doing a movie that talks about religion... Hmmmmm I wonder what his message is going to be
The new Michael
Weird that they have Keanu Reeves just playing himself.
Cristina Yang ??? lol
why do I feel like I've already seen this???
This looks like a typical Hollywood victimhood behavior movie where the moral is blame everyone else for your life decisions
Киану Ривс раньше: Матрица, Константин, Адвокат Дъавола, итд Сейчас:
No way Seth Rogan making a comedy ?
Bots love it
Temu Trading Places
This looks good as hell haha
I love you Keanu ❤
Yes Jibril 🙏🫶🤗🩷
Did John Wick 5 just turned into a comedy?
hollywood copying bollywood??
bro lost against Gabriel in Constantine and became Gabriel in good fortune. truly an if you can't fight then join them ahh moment 😂😂😂
... If Castiel never met the Winchesters 👻
Constantine!
Nice! But god, please, don't let this be the Constantine sequel we are all waiting for.
Oh, I'm totally seeing this.
The disrespect on all religion. Christians and Muslims believe in The Angel Gabriel, why name him that? Name him john or something else. Why is Seth Rogan always disrespecting Christianity ?
Awful
Finally something actually worth watching!! This looks like my kind of humor and all 3 are great casting choices 🎩
It look so bad.
Now heaven won’t need Kenny to fight Satan’s army since they actually have Keanu Reeves.
TUKER NASIB ANYING WKWKWKWK
Keanu does reminds me of Pit in Kid Icarus games 👼
Out of know where they got aziz to be in this? Os he even active still?
Keanu slowly become Jesus
no way ign spelled seth rogen’s name wrong
I see Keanu Reeves, I clicked
Keanu looking similar Star Forge Light Side Revan without lightsaber
Keanu … ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Seth  ❤️ ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Aziz 😏😏😏😏
hmmmm, Keanu's waiting for his next big script - others have their 9th house to buy
The facial look and body language is still like john wick 🙂
Doesn't changes look.
Yeah...chrisitanity saving an Indian from his heathen religion...thanks hollywood. 🙄
The stupid Seth Rogan laugh is even more annoying coming from a 50 year old man
Bro is creating his own cinematic universe with that john wick look in all movies
What an original idea .. Hollywood has gone borderline shitty. Repeating the same old again and again .
It’s crazy that Seth Rogan is only 43. I thought he must be 55
Why indian
ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴛʏᴘᴇ ᴏғ ᴡɪɴɢs ᴀʀᴇ ᴛʜᴀᴛ
This looks HORRRIBLE
So a modern take on Trading Places? Not complaining… just observing and the music choice drove it home.
Constantine, stop messing around with those fake wings.
Trading Places
The man, the myth, the legend 'Baba Yaga'' himself to an angel 💀
Find me a fault with Keanu Reeves.  Just one.  Other than Matrix Resurrections
Constantine on a budget
looks like shit
most problems that poor people have would be solved with money
Aside from Aziz being a box office poison, the idea that a guy "is in tech", so his parents have money and his life is sweet. Bunch of nonsense.
He's just playing himself.
Using the song from the movie trading places was an awesome detail!
Wait What John Wick 5 or maybe Constantine 2
jesus christ  - what's up ?
Oh my god! this looks ACTUALLY good. Maybe hollywood is turning around lol.
Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves, lolz!
We’ve been waiting for the next Constantine and we get this shit instead 🤦‍♂️
Constantine is f+-__:
This gives me little Nicky vibes
This movie is half BLASPHEMY and half the movie TRADING PLACES... And Keanu is still doing his bland acting style he created for the John Wick movies. SKIP.
Damn Johnny Silverhand really going on side quests 😂
Good to see Aziz Ansari is back, he was missing form master of none season 3
not the SIZE of the wing (that matters).. Actually, it is ...oh, well that's too bad 🤣🤣
John wick after retirement 😂😂😂😂
1:10 I mean... yeah, money would fix 99% of the worlds problems The only reason rich people don't think it'd fix anything is because they were born INTO wealth and have never gone with a need unfulfilled, so ofcourse "more money" to them isn't going to bring them happiness But anyone that's suffered through poverty?  Life changing (so long as they aren't drug addicts before they come into possession of the money) We don't need EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM fixed, but having a majority of them, mostly pay-walled by high cost, would be amazing
Why does it look like AI Genrated.
wtf is this..
Seth Rogen = sh*t movie
whats that song in the background that starts at 1:07?
lol you spelled a name wrong
❤❤❤❤❤❤
so his real name is Constantine... got it
Classic Haverford!
this is so stupid
Ah, so this is the sequel to Constantine that I've been hearing about.
Oh how the mighty have fallen...
So Keanu reaves as himself? Magnificent human being ☺️
ow this is gonna be litt
Is this AI ?
We all want  JOHN WICK 5,  Wick please comeback
The fact that Keanus costume in this movie reminds of DC Constantine
so......this angel would bring a Glock and AR-15?? and uhhh Benelli M4 for the end of the day??
Look I adore Keanu too, but I swear his acting is getting worse
2025 and the angel wings look like they came out of dollar tree
Ain't no way Keanu Reeves is playing Gabriel from Temu
This movie is guna be lit
I need to see this movie
Don't like wings, but it's growing on me. Hate Aziz Ansari, and he is Not growing on me :) Looks like a fun movie though :)
“Leave me alone Jeff i like it it’s all I have”  lol idk why but that killed me 😂
PERFECT casing!  Keanu is the closest human being alive to an angel there is.
Man...this movie looks like a fall of an angel...looks a bit like a box office flop to me.
John Wick as my angel? Go ahead , make me unstoppable.
"I did everything I was supposed do to but nothing is working out."  Yeah, buddy, tell me about it.
Definitely one to look out for.
At least it's original.  Sick of sequels
Trench Coat ,, Castiel is that u ?!
Aziz Ansari ? nah I am Not watching This Shit 💩 even Though I Love Keanu A Muslim Actor aziz next to him Nah a Big No
I can’t wait to see this!
Wow. Another movie I HAVE TO REMEMBER not to watch. Back to the 234th time watching an old Kurosawa. Sigh.
I guess he didn't go to hell
Yes that’s what I truly thought you were an angel but I discovered so much more then I could ever say and now I am truly heartbroken!!!!!!
"it seemed to have solved most of his problems" holy moly, watching this movie from that line alone, it was SO REAL  finally, a movie that doesn't mention how "money isn't everything" messaging from elites and Hollywood executives while they smoke cigars in their yachts.
Looks like AI
To bad Seth Rogans In this movie
Constantine doing part time job as an angel
hell nah This just looks like a john wick parody c'mon keanu
Constantine has evolved
Archangel?
I'm going to tell my kids that Keanu's Jesus
Fuck yeah r rated comedies making a come back this looks fun
This is a sequel of John wick 😂😂
It's Jeff!
Did ai make this?
thats just jesus
Ironic that he fought Gabriel in Constantine and now is Gabriel 😂
The next Constantine...
Cutting Seth will make the movie 100% better, even if the plot no longer makes sense for it.
Can we make some cars whose engine sounds like Seth Rogen laugh!!!
def constantine 2
Musculine fu**in john week become feminine Angel
For a moment I thought it's just another fanmade AI video😂😂😂
ahh, he's an angel now huh. is he will be still kicking and punching in this movie? this is kinda interesting.
The highest compliment I can give Keanu Reeves is he is like dogs, every time I think I can’t love him more I see something that proves me wrong.
I might actually have to watch my first Seth Rogan movie in over a decade
It's Freaky Friday 2, but for dudes.  Seriously, four main characters body-swapping is too much for my rodent male brain.
Haha this is so funny
Chef wick.
shut up and take my money already
This looks terrible. Why would anybody be in something written so horribly?
wow
Keanu missed the Bill and Ted comedy scenes but they been type casting the man too long.  Seth Rogen knew this and brought us the funny side of Keanu that I'm fairly confident he's been long awaiting to do again.  Well played fellas. Well played.
So we have a movie about an happy castiel
Okay, the preview finally made me want to see the movie. Darn, now I'm excited to seeing a Seth Rogan film.
Yo what is the last song that plays in the trailer PLEASE
This looks like Constantine 2 calling
Giving 1990s cheesy comedy and I like it.
Its release date is my birthday... Too bad im too broke, and too far from any movie theater...
Wow that looked unbelievably unfunny, that looked on par with that Chris Rock movie Down to Earth, Rogan deserves this for dropping out James Franco, I mean what made him after seeing Bill and Ted 3 think hey Reeves is a crease ... Even if this really happened and was the amazing true story of an angel coming to earth and interfering it would still not be funny, no thats called demonic isn't it. The wokest shit I've seen since the last Disney movie, thank the devil for South Park .. what, that's a saying!!
Seth Rogan's signaling: replace former best mate with the nicest (to women) guy in the world. Take that, James Franco!
Okay, this movie kinds sucksss tbh.  Not wasting my time. It's not doing anything for me.
OMG is this even real? this is truly terrible
he died then went to heaven
Finally, Constantine was able to go to heaven, he made it.
Is this John Wick 5?
The construct has evolved into an angel now?
"Am I the only one who thinks Keanu is not as good an actor as people say?"
Yeahhhhhh no
thats look like a fucking shit
This is where John went
Oh wow who would have thought money would solve most of your problems
I like the concept 😊
Gabriel is an angel of focus, commitment and sheer will
Money doesn’t fix all your problems. Only accepting God into your life does.
now how im gonna take u serious in Wick series after this?
Now why did they make Keanu talk like Xavier Renegade Angel?
I can't unsee John Wick
What a cringe.
He's like a chicken angel!!!
constantine looks different
Why does Keanu Reeves always look like he’s parodying as a Keanu Reeves on a budget?
Keanu can make me watch anything...except finish John Wick 4. This looks like a good time. Can't wait!
Keanu wanted Constantine 2 and Director wanted an comedy, so they both got what they wanted :D
if seth rogan wasn't in this, i'd be more interested.  I just despise him.... but I do like keanu and aziz is pretty cool
Is this some kinda lame reboot of "Trading Places"?
Can't get con2 so we got this 😂
it's amazing that someone as bad as Keanu Reeves is at acting has had such a long career. just horrendous
I wanted Constantine 2, not this.
Why do movies always make Michael the badass hes depicted as in the bible but Gabriel, who is also a pretty powerful archangel, is always depicted as a joke, bad guy, or just a plebe... the only exception I can think of is Gabriel from Legion. And he was still a "bad guy"
Whatever you do Keanu, please don't ever get cancelled. I don't know how I would cope. 🥺
Finaly a piece of media that doesnt treat wealth as some extreme burden and instead what is actually is. A blessing brought about by extreme luck in circumstances and something that should be used for good and not treated like something you "earned"
John wick is going through a midlife crisis
We need Constantine 2 !!
John Weak
hes literally an angel
Budget gurdian angel 😂😂😂
John Wick becoming the most Badass angel!
Actual comedy in 2025? I swear to God if you idiots let this flop...
Constantine doing anything except a second movie
I will not redeem.
Why tf do they all sound so weird wtf, horrible audio quality
gabriel? like gabriel from ultrakill?
So Jeff is the antagonist. Understood.
Well it's closest we have gotten to Constantine 2. I'll take it
Rules & consequences!
This looks like what would you make in ai video generator
0:02 is AI voice
We've got a city to     Save?
I want to watch this.
Looking forward to it! Keanu in his prime, waiting for Constantine 2
Nah, Keanu I'm not gonna watch this...
Supernatural fans dressing up for Comic Con be like:
Castiel using Keanu Reeves as his vessel
This looks hilarious
leave me alone Jeff, I like it, it's all I have.
You lost me with Aziz
Jewish movie about Jewish things.
This looks awful
Aziz is the reason i m not gonna to theater to watch this movie.
We got Constantine sequel before Constantine 2
Not a good fit for Keanu at all.....
John Wick after he died in Chapter 4
This… looks… awful!!!!
This looks fucking terrible.
After a lifetime of busting Demons, Constantine has finally earned his wings.
Can't accept him anymore with anything except wick john wick!
This looks hysterical, never thought I would see Keanu, Seth and Aziz working so well as a trio together 😂
Only thing that make me avoid this movie is I can't stand seth rogan laugh.
They are really leaning into the "Trading Places" comparisons by putting "Do ya Wanna Funk" in the trailer.
Direct sequel to Constantine.  He replaced Gabriel but had to start at the bottom rank.
Киану Ривз и Порш. Wake up, samurai.
WTF is this
😂 I cant wait
Freaky Friday meets It’s a Wonderful Life!?!? With these 3?!? IM IN!! 🤘🏼🤣❤️
John Constantine Becomes the Angel Now 😂
This looks awesome
Face off chapter 2 :)
Imagine meeting Keanu IRL and he tells you he is an angel, and a few weeks later you see him again smoking a cig lol
If you close your eyes, you can kinda hear Johnny Silverhand helping this man.
So Male freaky friday featuring Keanu reeves. Im here for it.
His john Constantine again with wings this time
This is not on my Bingo card lol
Keanu said more words during this trailer than in an entire John Wick movie
If i see Keanu reeve on the heaven , i wouldn't be surprise at all
Going to be a good movie only because of Keanu. Btw, isn't this a gaming channel?
Oh great, they used Eric Wu's (CEO of Opendoor) home ($32 million dollar mansion at 11490 Orum Road, Bel Air, Los Angeles) as the base of the movie.   How nice.
Can Keanu please be my Guardian Angel?
I love Anziz Ansari!
That actually looks class
So you guys will watch him do whatever now.
So is this a Johnny Silverhand situation where he plays as a voice and an imagine in someone else head?
Disappointment
"To forgive is up to God and to bring you to him is up to me" -Angelic Keanu
Good enough..welcome back Constantine
anyone else thought of the mandela catalogue when they first saw the trailer lmao
This feels terribly stilted and glitchy - Someone switched another comedian for Neo.
I like Keanu Reeves, but unless he changes his hairstyle and beard, no matter what he does, I can't help but think of him as John Wick.
Looks super fun 😊
Voice sounds like AI gen...
John wick became an angel? 😂
Looks.. Good. 😍
So they made Trading Places but w/ an Angel, and even used music from Trading Places in the trailer that only made me think "Who put their KOOLS on out my carpet!?". lol, i'll still watch it
Angel got depressed instead.
This gives classic snl vibes
When God and Devil let Constantine be an Angel for one human
I feel like the angel thing has been done before.
👎🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧
So Kenau will never cut his hair again? All I can see is John wick. Don't like it.
Eh its funny, roll a joint and watch it i guess lol
Not Gabriel. Not the big G. He is the leader of all angels. Get some minor one s
this is why you never allow comedians to make movies.........
Movie seems chill... gotta watch
What are they doing to the Boggy Man
After the death of John wick, he now became an angel 😇
john after death became john weirdo
Make for us JOHN WICK chapter 5
Make for JOHN WICK chapter 5
What is this
This looks simple fun heart warming..!
Bro's acting was too good bro can't get over the John Wick role😭
Jeeff is lucky being guardian by john wick opps budget Gabriel
ChristianPunk 2025
thought it was another john wick spin off for a sec
Comstantine really went from stopping Gabriel from unleashing Lucifer's son to the Earth to becoming him.
i will watch it only because Keanu Reeves is in it.
1:11 so that's where Johnny got the Porsche from in Cyberpunk
His delivery makes this SO MUCH MORE FUNNIER 😂
Why do I feel that Keanu has been dying to play a Angel role for decades 😂 I'm so for it
these movies that try to appeal to the "common person" make me sick; fk hollywood
John Wick meets Pineapple Express
The most AI used script ever
Well we got john constantine cosplaying as an angel, I guess?
Johnny Silverwings
No thanks
To be honest this movie look cringe in the beginning but look fun to watch until the trailer end.
Dude reeves can play anything I love to see him explore his acting career!! Rock on man!!!!
So you ALL know there's no such thing as a "budget" guardian angel. Dying in a car crash is horrible and bro has been saving lives frfr. I wouldn't have disrespected Keanu
I haven't been excited for a movie in a decade! HOLY SHT
1:10 Johnny Silverhand 🎸
Excellent satire?  Is his new girlfriend  Catholic
Looks like they paid well the writer this time.
Aziz paying homage to Keanu here. Cyberpunk with his car. Constantine with the cigarettes'   Perfect comedy spin-up
Trading places... But current
I am feeling so emotional for keanu Reeve may be aka John wick which name is ruined by this trailer. God may bless soul of John wick
He’s literally a high key angel on earth tho
John wick 5: Man has to atone for all the Gunkata to enter heaven🥲
I see Keanu. I click.
Keanu is 60 now.  Where did the time go?
Looks like this is going to be a fun watch :)
Wait so a profit can't fix his problems so he called an angle? 😂
Nooo, not Seth and his laugh...
Why does this feel like an ai generated movie?
If Keanu was not in this movie I wouldn't even think of seeing it.
Ngl I was expecting some Angel gunfight action, but this seems nice, too.
Wake up, Samurai. We have a jesus to christ.
Thanks for the whole movie!
Genius potential
come on man just give us CONSTANTINE man
looks funny
Oy vey
Keanu looks so stress or fkd up there 🤣🤣🤣
The man's an angel ... Plus marks to the casting director
Wow Nice Hero And Johan Wick 4 Parts Most Papular
He plays the guy in your head so well. He was great in Cyberpunk.
After killing so many people as John wick now he is Angel 😆
similar to Trading Places. Even has the same song
This is goofy, but goofy in a good way, I’m all for it
When your Angel is John Wick❤
I think I am going to watch this movie at movies.
This was his original retirement plan until Vigo's son k!lled his dog
Lol wheres franco seth?? We swapped for azis
I NOTICE THAT THERE IS NO CGI IN IT BECAUSE ALL THE BUDGET WAS DEPLETED IN PAYING THE ACTORS AND I LOVE THE NON CGI ANGLE WINGS LOL
I tried to show him that wealth wouldn't truly solve his problems. I love that line!
Keanu need stop lookin like John wick aleeady dam Constantine 2 gon look like John in hell smh
If Keanu Reeves walked up to me and told me he was an angel I would immediately believe him without any hesitation
Not good
Pookie movie 😂 so cute
What is the resolution going to be? He’s right money does solve most of the problems we have if we don’t have it.
This looks like one of those movies actor does to recalibrate their creativity when they're in the same role for too long.
Constantine sequel, from RA to PG13
It's great to see Keanu go back to comedy and pairing up with Rogen is just ..chef's kiss.
We have "Constantine 2" before GTA 6
bruh i saw this trailer for a second on tv and thought it was constantine 2 :(
I swear I thought this was an AI parody😅😅
Looks good I can't wait to watch it.
So he’s John Wick in every movie now 😂
No way, he ended in heaven after john wick? He killed half of the civilization!
Looks like the alternative dimensions are popping out of nowhere DR.STRANGE WHYYYY!!!?
John Travolta  Michael (1996 film)?
As far a I remember last time he punched an angel
This must be set in the same universe where God is Morgan Freeman
why aziz ansari though??? can't stand his....voice....
u know thing went bad when angel start to smoking and act like john constantine
Constantine 2
I absolutly love how the comments are a mix between cyber punk references and john wick keanu reeves
Thank... God. For the first 20 seconds I thought it was the new Constantine directed by Jaden Smith.
God it's Me We Need To Talk.
Gabriel Dropout 2
john wick dies........... satan: oh no no no you go up i got a doom guy problem already
At this point, all keanu movies are just wick life pre & post john wick 4
In John wick 4 he died and go to heaven. And now he is an ex-communicado in heaven therefore he has come to earth   Rules........
Aziz needs to take an acting class.
they should have gave Keanu a man bun for this role.
The true angel him self, Keanu Reeves.
You spelt Seth Rogen wrong, typical IGN
hearing fatboy slim makes me instantly nostalgic
Seeing the way people have talked about Keanu in these comments and others I’m realizing there is a whole generation of people who know him from John Wick…and thats like the foundation of their Keanu Reeves knowledge. Wild.
YES!!!!! Thank you God. I cant wait to see
Keanu Reeve 's acting is so bad.
I really thought they'd never make a sequel to John Wick 4. And here we are, John Wick 5. Yessss.
Johnny Angelwings
This seems like a wholesome movie. I dig it.
John Wick is now - - - > Holy John
Its strange seeing john wick talk so much 😂
This movie is so cute I like it when Keanu Reeves keeps the John Wick look but he is an angel
Seth Rogen* how do you fuck that up
Looking forward to this one!!
Hmm
seriously Keanu whats wrong with you from John wick to this shit
another corny movie with one LEGEND and 2 idiots
ok this legit sucks ass especially with that aziz
Lucifer in reverse
We got John Wick as an angel before GTA 6
I don't not heaven I like hell is favorite
Keanu giving us entertainment since I have Memory ❤
john wick morreu e virou um anjo
Oh, so this is what happened to John Constantine after he went to heaven.
>Seth Rogan
John Wick died. and god turned him into a angel as punishment
this seems funny 😅
Thanks right Keanu. You play that role.
Why Keanu? Why?  What a blunder decision to star in this ridiculous excuse for a movie!
the angel of focus, commitment, and sheer will :)
So... I'm thinking someone else may have caught this, but the trailer is playing Patrick Cowley's "Do You Wanna Funk" which was from the house party scene of Trading Places, lmao. This is great!
So Shadow the Hedgehog became an Angel.
Those are real wings btw
LOL this is just what I need
I see Keanu, I like and watch
This feels AI generated
Direct sequel to John Wick 4
Fire your proofreader. Ya spelled Seth Rogen's name wrong. 😂
This actually looks funny because money does solve your problems. the lie is that it doesn't
Why is he copying my boy castiels fit
AI is getting good 😂😂
Keanu acting as himself
😂😂😂 👏👏👏
The main leads that only sees Keanu Reeves. Where have I heard this before...
keanu is great, rest of the cast...........nah
For some reason I wanna watch this
It's not right to mock god.
Johnny Silverhand's porsche
Thanks just watched the whole movie in this trailer.
I tried to show him that wealth wouldn't solve all of his problem And What ?... It seems to have solve most of his problems
It has Keanu. Even with Seth Rogan in it, how can I NOT watch this?
The Good Place - a demon gets pulled up from evil to human imperfection Good Fortune - an angel gets pulled down from goodness to human imperfection
Ask sodom and gomorrah about The Angel Gabrial,  Ask Earth about the day that it rumbled when the land of the dead sea was created, lowest point on earth.  He is an Angel with 600 wings you infidels.  He is Faithful servant of God.  He is the one who was ordered to bring down for you the knowledge that can make you better humans you freaking ignorants.  And thats how you repay him.  Drown in your misery, you let the Devil use you for his fucking games. You just cant have morals anymore.  Face the consequences.
WHAT A COMEBACK FROM AZIZ! HELL YEAH! WE"RE SO BACK! BROWN BOYS ARE SOOO UP!
They already did angel with jhon Travolta great movie next!!!!!!!
Too bad seth rogan ruins it.
Damn I hope this is good
As a man who works 70 hour work weeks between 2 jobs who STILL cannot afford a home, despite working a job that requires a college degree, this trailer hits home.
I actually had a good laugh at this. It's on my movies to see list now.
Johnny Silverhand taking another stab at being the voice in someone's ear.
Im exclusively watching this movie because Keanu is in it. I've been a fan of him since i was a kid rewatching the Matrix and Bill and Teds. Glad to see he's still going
What a great spin on the prince and the pauper story.
finally a movie or piece of media that admits 99% of our problems would be solved if we were rich....
Johnny Silverhand found his porsche at 1:10 😂
Yang is here❤
My man doing every side quest posible
This is a Great movie Gabriel got many misdions😍🙏❤️❤️❤️🌿🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌿
Constantine came back but with small wings lol
Smells like the rich are just rubbing it in our faces and blaing it on God, at this point.
Seth Rogan.....gross.
Just had a realization, what if these comments are AI? Lol Fabricate good comments so people can watch the movie. You wouldnt be able to tell unless taking the time to look through everyone's profile. And even then a company can just elaborately make fake profiles. Just saying. But, I would watch this movie. Lol
Did KR really need to do a rip off of Constantine? We need this like Pirates of the Caribbean 8. And Rocky 28.
Im not hyped for this Constantine sequel
😂 LOL ,,, John Wick was nothing huh
i guess ill check this out
ok but seth rogen in this automatically makes it on the not-watching list
Nah , not that interesting
"Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogin star in ..." I am in.
What’s wrong with their cartoonish voices ?!
Michael meets freaky friday meets white chicks?
cmon keanu the bills cant be that high
I hope there is a twist at the end where Keanu’s character is actually Jesus with amnesia
First world problem drama comedy. Gtfo
Don't you love it when a movie trailer saves you a 2 hour outdoor activity, plus a $20 on a ticket by condensing a movie into a 2min short? 😌
The way this felt like AI at first…made me cringe…but then I was sold by the end NGL.
I can't wait to see this! I may actually go to the theater to watch it. Still waiting on Constantine 2 tho
If Mesha doesn't show up and compliments Keanu's trench coat. I will be severely disappointed.
I would of preferred Kal Penn (Kumar - From Herold & Kumar) instead of Aziz Ansari, personally.
He turn into literal Hollywood Jesus
I wanted this without ever knowing I wanted this.
Aziz Ansari lecturing us with some lols thrown in. Noice.
Keanu Reeves finally playing its own role
Yeah this is what we need Hollywood! Get back to creativity! Less hero movies, less girl boss movies, less requels and reboots! More creativity! AND COMEDY!
I first heard that song in the movie trading places. I see what you did there
Talk about a change of character. Good one for Keanu
We just want Constantine 2 man…
This movie looks and sounds AI generated.
Honestly, money DOES fix most peoples' problems. It can't buy happiness, but it can be one hell of a stress reliever.
I hope he says 'Yeah...' then pulls out his Pencil ✏️
Hey Seth Rogan.. How are about you help your supposed best friend get back on the horse James Franco instead of acting like he never fricking existed.
this has got to be one of the worst edited trailers i've ever seen
Oh no, John Constantine... You smokes again !? 😲 🤦‍♂️ You know Lucifer is waiting for you still right ? 🙄
Bro, mindless fun movies are all I want right now!
I want to think this movie is a mockery of Gabriel the Angel from Constantine
Seems like john constantine has taken a break from exorcisms and spiritual warfares
Crap dude holy crap dude what is necessary now is now necessary
Looks great
From burning Arasaka Tower to Guardian Angel, really?
Ahh, the Silverhand Porsche just to top it all off.
Keanu is a legend, but Seth Rogan is a complete tools box.
I thought the trailer usually shows the best parts?
GOD IT'S JEFF!!!! 😂
“Leave me alone Jeff. I like it. It’s all I have.”  😂😂 the way he said that
Okay I wait this one out but this has to be a prediction for the next Constantine right?
Almost interested but you have that annoying Aziz in there. No thanks
City of Angels 2
Bro doing side quest now
From matrix.. Constantine.. John wick to Golden Retriever
Seems a lot like that Christmas movie Ryan Reynolds did
I hope this comedy works 😂. I will look at it only because of KR
Blasphemy ?
Johnny silverhand???
I'll probably skip this one but I'm happy for Keanu. He's taking a break from the usual action packed stuff to do something little different and silly and I'm all for it.
This looks good—finally, movies without politics or wokeness.
I can't wait. This looks Great
1:15 Finality a movie that admits it and that the whole trope of switching of lives is not true
just love it
Hmmm.... idk about this one. Keanu is great as always, but the movie overall looks meh.
Seth RogEn
Solution: So, I'm not gonna swap lives back with you, but, here's 10 million dollars, go start your own business, good luck, never come back here again.
Man they really struggling in the movie industry what the frick is this
My dumbass thought it said good Fortnite 😂😂
oh this is gonna be great
John Wick in every Keanu Movie
after playing cyberpunk i cant hear keanu's voice the same
Looks like a great premise ruined by being associated with two of the worse comedians ever.
Who is Aziz Ansari ??
Babayaga’s alter ego…Gabriel
What did Keanu get paid to be in this gurgle laughing piece of
So those theories about John Wick being alive has now been debunked. Because he is already an angel... by a contract. :D
Keanu's comedic timing is so on point here :D
This looks like garbage
they got AI mouth
Lucifer
Would have been 10x better without Aziz
Isn’t this just Trading Places mixed with It’s a Wonderful Life.
Keanu Reeves (when marvel calls): Yeah...not really! Keanu Reeves (when literally any other director with good script and/or animated/game roles calls): HELL YEAH! LETS DO IT!
oddly it feels like AI-made
give this angel a pencil
i saw Johnny Silverhand's car
Undercover Constantine.
Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor holy shit
Just Waooow, that's what I expected, forget repeating yourself in Constantine or John Wick
Straight to DVD vibes
Dam I’m stoked for this! Keanu hasn’t done a comedy since way back
Yes, I will watch it
Alright Youtube, put Gabriel into Cyberpunk
This movie looks so stupid i can tell it's gonna be the best comedy i will see
Pizza Pizza(Canadian)
Gabriel from ULTRAKILL?
No offence but i hate his stupid hair style
This makes me want to watch Constantine.
Keanu might be one of the nicest is guys on earth, and has been in some awesome films, but no one can accuse him of being a good actor.
"Death is never in my option"
john wick died in chapter 4  reincarnated in heaven as gabriel..
Idk the dialog seems so cheesy
I think with the corporate world creating more wealth inequality, we will start seeing more films like this, where the theme is "be happy with what you have, do not envy the rich". They want people to be content with less than they should have and to just shut up.
So is this movie supposed to save Aziz
What the actual f
I didn't know about  this movie  keanu is a real angel
Great idea...poorly executed...👎👎
I didn't expect Keanu being Xavier
Keanu is just playing the same guy in every movie. Doing the bare minimum
Where is roman Reigns
Since when is hard f bombs in trailers been socially acceptable? This country has no decency anymore.
nachos, guacamole and mojitos seems pretty good.
Like if you're going to watch it 😉
Blasphemy
Sooooo.... John Wick really died, but he's a good human buuuuuut killed too many people then sentenced to be a budget guardian angel for 300 years....hmmm sounds like Along With the Gods plot for me
Using "Do You Wanna Funk?" from Trading Places is a little on the nose, but it has potential...
That is Constantine before he started smoking...oh wait
Keanu Reeves IRL is more Angel than John Wick
i just watched constantine
Gonna be a banger
سوبر كفريات
Garbage
Seth Rogan having Jeff Life😂😂😂😂😂😂
"ma name is Jeeeff.."
boring repetitive same real life
The most dialogues Keanu had since Matrix Revolution.
Despite being a good person, Keanu Reaves is terrible actor
1:07: Trading Places! What a reference!
How did this guy rope in Keanu???😅
I love this movie already, I can feel the vibe, predictable yet one of those movies where you don't reason and just enjoy their humours😂
what? i love it
First I was excited but then I read "Seth Rogan, Aziz Ansari" so nevermind then
Just missing Al Pacino as the devil
johnny silverhand
God! Its Jeff!!!
All i can hear is Johnny Silverhand
You can see kindness in his eyes, hear kindness in his voice. He's an angel, no doubt.
Who will go theatre to see this trash
😂Wtf is this
Angel Ted 😂
me saa love it..
😂😂😂
I need to watch this.
Keanu giving less than Dua Lipa
Typo in the title : it says Seth RogAn instead of RogEn
Not a fan of Seth Rogan buts this has promise
WTF is this ? 😅
Hell ya Aziz! We're so back
Loving the transformation from Constantine to an Angel!
Looks pretty nice, worth seeing
Gabriel is literally one of the most powerful Angels in heaven, how is he a budget Angel???
Would have been funny if he has a angel dog
Stupid as fuck
This is the most plausible continuation of both Constantine and John Wick.
Remember guys, this movie is based on true story of 100 million+ Americans....
Less Serious Keanu Reeves is great AF
John Wick now is realy angel!😄😄😄
Ill watch anything with keanu but my god I cannot stand that aziz piece of turd
"I showed him that wealth isn't worth it" "And?" "It solved majority of his problems"
Looks Terrible!
Gabriel : huh 😒😒😒😒
My God his acting is soooooo bad.  How people like the guy is beyond me.
Wait john wick is in this movie?
I was already leaning toward watching this but the scene at 1:08 sealed the deal.
Written AND directed by Asari bro
undeniably needs a watch at the big screen.
Yes, we need more comedy and silly movies. This, happy gilmore, naked gun,..
john wick is an angel after he died in part 4 ??
We got Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen in a single movie before GTA VI
This just feels like Hollywood people thinking they’re fresh and funny when this feels incredibly stale
i love it
If this didn't have Ashneeze Achu in it, I might be interested.
After all the "Johns" Keanu finally gets to be a Gabriel.
Why did they choose that actor to play the lead. The most unfunny and boring person ever. And a horrible actor.
Why name him Gabriel and then completely ignore everything the bible says about Gabriel if not to mock him?  Gabriel is Gods messenger and deliverer of prophetic messages. Gabriel appeared to Daniel and explains the meaning of his visions about future kingdoms and the "seventy weeks" prophecy.  Gabriel appeared to Zechariah to announce the birth of John the Baptist. He was the herald of John's birth and a deliverer of judgement upon Zechariah.  Gabriel came to Mary, the mother of Jesus, to tell her she will bring the messiah into the world. The most important message in our history. But for some reason this movie decides to portray him as a guardian angel for people who text and drive? That's so gross.  Why wouldn't they just give him a different name? Why did they have to belittle and mock Gods messenger like this? As a fan of Keanu Reeves this is heartbreaking.  I wont be watching this movie, or any of Keanus future projects. The fact that he is working with Aziz Ansari is also disappointing. This sucks.
This is going to be good ❤❤❤
Johnny Silverhand Porsche
yoo john wick is back
I'm sold!
I think jhon wick with serious face and dilogue timing will rock comedy
No wonder John Wick never dies, he's an angel.
He's gotta do this before Constantine 2.
When will this color grading style die 🤮  Bring back film. Every movie/show looks the same.
Keanu finally has lost all his last few acting skills? 🤣
Amen
Seth Rogan is in this? I'll skip.
Was ruined as soon as they added serh rogan .
This is either gonna be terrible or awesome
Im already tearing up DWL
Cant wait 😂
The Heaven Continental has been treating Wick well.  "Far better than I deserved."
Im a simple man. I see seth rogans name and i disregard the project.
Budget Constantine 2
So Constantine took Gabriel's job after he went to heaven? nice
Trading Places .... that's cool if so
Bullshit
wow. this looks terrible
damn another blockbuster were all the top actors get to play and look exactly like themselves while phoning in a mediocre perfomance, bet it will be huge!
now film trailer actually said it that you ain't actually self-made & money actually solves most of your problem
Ig Toms fragrance line failed.
Role well deserved for Keanu
John Wick this you twin?
Cool I'm looking forward to that .that's all I got. .oh whait no I can't .not entel it's free om you tube .that's realy all i got .if i hang up side down.and pick up a signal.
Constantine 2 confirmed?
Keanus line delivery is so distracting 😂
looks like crap  PS. Sorry Keanu
there is something weird about actors playing the working man role and getting paid handsomely to do so. acting like they know our struggle while they seat in their ivory towers.
This is what he meant when he was asked about constantine sequel
I need  to see azizs friend from master of none in thiz
I'll buy ticket at Keanu saying "See the wings"
Modern spin on Trading Places and I'm all in for it
Keanu and Gabriel, at last. Together 😂
This might actually be a roll that fits Keanu's potato acting range.
He looks like jesus
Seth Rogan just playing himself in an average day and getting paid for it.
So Constantine became Gabriel and still can't quit smoking
Seth Rogen* not Rogan
That line about the cigarettes 'Leave me alone, i like it, it's all i have left' i have said many times..
Aziz getting a soft relaunch after his sexual assault stuff I see 😂
Alright Keanu please lose the beard and that personality with that... Can we please have Point Break, Speed, The Matrix, Constantine and 47 Ronin "Keanu" personality, that passive-but-smooth-aggressive or whatever you call it... This really feels like a tired, given up, beaten up, somewhat-sad vibe is really unpleasant... Come on, please Shave up, put up some weight, use a body-double, anything but not this
If Keanu was my angel all I’d ever want is just to talk to him no money no wealth no nothing just whenever I wanna chat he comes out of the sky wherever I am for a chat
this looks like it's goona be a good one!
looks like movie for transgenders
what targets audiences is this ?
Keanu reeves just flushed himself down the toilet
Can't wait. Reminds me of "family man", "Trading places" or that Chris Rock movie I think it's called "Down to earth". All these Rolled into one 😂
Let's be real here, we all need guardian angel like keanu reeves!
Johnny silver hand Neo & Constantine are back 🎉😅
Wow I didn't realize how much I missed that squeaky voice
Sooo.. is there a reason to watch this movie? It kinda feels like the movie will be a longer version of this trailer
Soooo its Trading places but instead of Edie murphy and wall street bros its an Angel and a Tech bro lol been done but it was good last time so hopefully it will be good this time too!
I wonder if they picked that exact porche because of cyberpunk and Keanu's affiliation with it? 😅
Johnny Silverhand?
this time its nice that trailers have become so long, now i don't have to watch the movie anymore
Nice
John Wick taking this undercover shit a little too far...
Someone gave Aziz an Adam Sandler script
If he's really acting like that, it's going to be bad.
John Wick doing side quests.
ST WICK
John wick 5 : after life
So do we know the exact date of when this is coming out?
I fuck with it definitely watching it when high
Constantine 2 please before I die.
Thanks IGN
we need to bring back goofy movies like this, enuf with some super hero bullshit
Ok, gonna Watch It for sure
Major Ted vibes lol
Incredibly stupid decision for putting Aziz in the role that Seth would be perfect for and Seth in the role Aziz would be perfect for. Kind of a cool idea but I can already tell I'm not going to be able to get over how bad the casting choices were.
An Actual Role Model in Hollywood.  Keanu Reeves is most Authentically loved movie star in Hollywood and it's Well Deserved.  A True Diamond in the rough.  Thank you God for blessing us with Keanu.
I like Keanu, but I feel like he's sleepwalking through the script here.  There's not much energy behind his performance.
Please let Keanu say "You're Awesome" in this movie to either Aziz or Seth. PLEASE.
1:11 The Cyberpunk Porsche👀
John Wick after reaching heaven 😂
jesus lookin guy said he's gabriel, yeah ...
First time he's not called John?
Love the shot of Aziz's dad, glad he's getting more screen time!
Lol the scene where Keanu angel tells Aziz "She's not consenting, stop tugging, and put it away!" was the best moment!
Keanu: What's next? "The opposite of what you did in John Wick"
Johnny silverhand ❌ Johnny silverwings ✅✅
it seems to have solved all of his problems!! lols . my goodness john wickey.
Finally we get to see Keanu act! Getting a little tired of just seeing his daily life, and tired of people telling me thats not his life thos are movies and im nah.. you cant tell me Keanu isn't bad ass in real life 😂😂😂😂
Keanu Reeves the traitor! And Seth who the fu** cares!
Finally, the return of weird and original movies. Hope Hollywood would keep this up.
after John Wick die..
Much like The Naked Gun, whether this is good or not we should all go see it just to show studios that we still want mid-budget comedies in theaters
Wake the **** up samurai, we got a oh wait he's an angel now 😇
Seth Rogen: Get me God, I want a meeting with God. GOD, it's JEFF XD !!!!! Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHA. HIS NAME IS JEFF. XD.....
Am I the only one who's first reaction was "AZIZ ANSARI IS BACK- YES!"?
At this point, us John Wick fans think this is a canon and John Wick is just doing side quest.
Soooo we got Johnny Silverhand's chip reconstructed as an angel. 10/10 Sequel
Keanu Reeves, is Keanu Reeves. In Keanu Reeves.
So John wick became a angel after death 😂👌
Now all we need is Castiel😂
1:09 "I tried to show him that wealth wouldn't solve all of his problems", ...."AND????"... "It seems to have solved most of his problems". I fucking spat my tea out at his deadpan delivery! I'm watching this movie.
How can Constantine, John Wick and an Angel be the same person?
I'm only going to see this for one reason and one reason only
Was that the same car  Keanu’s character had in cyberpunk?
Bad casting
He definitely has guns under that trenchcoat.
“I tried to show him that wealth wouldn’t solve all of his problems.”   “And?..”   “It seems to have solved most of his problems.”
The last time an angel wore a trenchcoat, there were 15 seasons of that show 🤭
My life would be complete if I had a budget guardian angel. Especially if it was Keanu Reeves.
This is just to fund speed 3 with Seth n Aziz ohhoho that little devil Keanu got us all fool once again!
Damn I might actually go see this in a cinema.
I'm a bit miss emotional Keanu Reeves with a thunderous voice...  He's either silent or too calm in his last movies. I understand, that he's not a young man now, but still...
Come on.... make a Constantin 2 instead mate
I never thought all my favorite trio in this movie. Can't wait
Keanu Reeves, please cut your hair. I'm tired of your John Wick image.
i love it 🤣🤣👌
Keanu is such a bland actor.   Yeah, I said it.
This is my favorite trailer of 2025❤
indian guy switches place with jewish guy and his problems been solved... what do they mean by this
When John Constantine meet Castiel
So John wick is back from the grave as an angel 😇😇
Keanu Reeves killing it with that wooden acting and dialog we all love him for😇
Something that looks actually entertaining, with people that are actually likable and talented. Wtf.
Seems really flat
Finally a movie that actually acknowledges that money does in fact fix almost all problems
Why does the first few scenes look ai generated? I think it’s got to do with the camera movement. Or maybe Keanu acts like an ai haha
Constantine for child?)
typical american movie
Maybe ill hate Seth ROgen a litle less after this. Keanu is just pure gold!
Poor Keanu. Aziz and Rogen? Bleck
looks good
absolutely love that aziz ansari is back on the scene
I'm waiting for this one.   I can't ignore AI 2:05
Trading places.... Classic movie.
okay I may be wrong, but the cigarette thing seems like a nod to the devil's advocate
watching keanu in pink swimming trunks is enough, im convinced
Aziz is a clown… can’t believe Keanu wasted his time making a film with this second rate comedian… must have sucked a lot of 🍆 to become in this film with Keanu… he has that kind of persona
Wing size is so small due to logistics cost 🧐
the world is healing when movies starting to appear like this instead of those low quality low budget disney aahh superhero bs (except avengers and old hero movies)
Chet and john wick best duo
@2:03 A Constantine Joke 😅
At first, I thought Keanu's robot-like acting was kinda weird, but the more I watched this, the more I realized it actually fits well for an out-of-touch angel.
Wake the f**k up, samurai, we got a luxury life to live!
It's Rogen, not Rogan.
Constantine lived long enough to become Gabriel
This is actually cool, This is cinema ! and Keanu's shift to comedy gettin great vibes
makes sense…he died in John Wick 4 and became and angel after that
Why does it sound like Phineas is talking to john wick?
I need this movie
Plays Constantine better
Atlast, "Constantine 2"!!
Fact: This is actually a Prequel to Johnny Silver-hands story before blowing up Arasaka tower.
well, That's "Constantine at home" version
Keanu looks more like God than an angel.
Woah! I'm impressed and mesmerized by Keannu's dry delivery of his lines.
Babayaga to gabriel 😅
Constantine 2 looks different than I expected 😆
So gonna see
This is giving me Bill and Ted iconic moments right now ppl forget Keanu Reeve was hilarious back in the day before he got into more serious roles
We need Constantine2 by  Keanu Reeves ❤
It seems to have solved most of his problems 😂
Can you fly? My wings are too small. It's not about the size. It actually is. 😂
YOOO Trailer for CP 2077 DLC is out!
You know who I am
The tiny wings are killing me.
Johnny Silverhands Porsche?
This has legendary movie written all over it
Why does the audio (specifically Keanu) sound AI generated? Have I just been playing too much Cyberpunk2077?
looks kinda of bad
Dude died as John Wick in John Wick 4, and now works as a Budget Guardian Angel, "Gabriel," for Arj.
a breath of fresh air...
Plot twist: Keanu Reeves is Jesus. Not an angel :P
honestly, his acting is bad
Budget guardian angel 😅😅
Hey isn't that small guy Big T from Parks and Rec?
this is awesome ~!
Holy shit I love when they hit us with the movie that we didn’t know we wanted.
he sure didnt want to change his look huh,he wants to keep that john wick image,guys cant act and you have seth jewgan of all people
Wooow ❤❤🎉😂😂
Ayoo..what happened to our Baba Yaga?!
Nice to see that Johnny still wouldn't kick the nicotine habit, even as an angel. XD
Keanu is awesome but unfortunately I won't be watching this because Seth Rogan is a moron, A**hole and can't act. Doesn't help he wanted to play politics and is getting himself boycotted.
Keanu Reeves: I am an angel. Me : so finally, they are releasing Keanu's Life documentary <3
Aziz got uncancelled !
Hard Pass....not funny
This could have been made using AI
👎
No offense to my current guardian angel but I would love to have a Keanu Reeves alike guardian angle
Keanu as an angel~~~ This is the Reality we prayed for man
Not seen Seth im years man maybe he’s saved the year with this one 💯
Pookie jhon wick ❤😅
True13True
Oh, Keanu finally just playing as himself.
man this sucks the creatives have really gone down the drain. it shows what a person that smokes weed is capable of, stupidity only
Its look like Netflix adaptation Constantine
I would love if there was a alternative version with seth rogan laugh dubbed by something less annoying :)
John Wick was a Matrix sim. He dies in 4, reboot = Good Fortune. Neo lives on…
Keanu, the "actor". 😂😂😂
So, basically Angels like ciggerate too. That's why they come on earth 😅😅😅😅
As much as we all love Keanu.. he cant really act. His line delivery is so bad. 90s Keanu had more emotion and cadence in his voice.
I knew it! The Jesus Reeves cameo in Spongebob were true
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💯💩
This looks super funny 😂
KR wants to play Constantine soo bad that he is acing the sadistic take on the closest next thing an Angel.
Is this the new age Dogma?
I'm an angel, whoa
Noice!
Ads on trailers shameful
so is this john wick's redemption arc in heaven after he died?
This is perfect, comedy returning
Kids in the comments like John Wick here, John Wick there, etc. He will forever be Neo, and Jack... and Johnny Utah for me.
Seth Rogan NOOOOOOO!! Can’t stand that gross bastard, how is he still cast
John wick, Seth Rogan , true Jackson lol
Keanu is the only actor that can act like a bad actor and it becomes angel level acting.
Keanu's acting is so bad but this looks really good lol
akash singh would have been a perfect cast
I love that Keanu is doing this and it's not an action movie, even though he's great at that. This looks really good, with Aziz & Seth, switching lives movies are always fun, and when someone gets a guardian angel, too. Can't wait!
insane cast line up
Lmao this looks really good !
I feel like I watched the whole movie
Sorry but Keanu's acting is terrible here.
In which we all are reminded Keanu can't act, Aziz Ansari is zero funny, and people who have been in Hollywood their whole lives think they can make relevant comments on real life.
Where tf is Constantine 2
Yeeeeaaaaa ima pass sorry guys.
This looks fun. If Naked Gun brings the crowds back to comedies in theaters, this will be there to ride the wave. Fingers crossed.
This is what's it like if Johnny Silver Hand is a good guy.
This is how low Keanu going down from Wick. I hope he is not going to that way long. Need to find another way to back up.
Well my loving faithful husband Keanu Charles Reeves is that how your with me in the spirit not that is making fun of God real angles man wow you do have a death wish don't you my Lord save my husband for real 🙏❤🙏❤🙏❤🔥
fitting role for a fitting angel
First V, now Jeff…
so you have to write & direct  your own story to play a somewhat meaningful character or semi-main character. thats hollywood for you.Amazing job by the way.
Anyone remember the movie Michael with John Travolta 😂😂😂
7/10
🤣🤣🤣 with all the ppl he kill in John wick.. this is good for him... 🤣🤣🤣
Obviously, he was shooting Ballerina and this movie at the same time.
damn cant believe johnny silver hand was an angel before he became a rockstar
From Grim Reaper to an Angle, what a turnout
It’s an exciting feeling whenever you see the names of your favorite actors tied to a movie trailer. I hit play so fast. 🎥🍿
John wick side job lol
Using the house party song from Trading Places.....I see you.
Didn't this dude sexualy assault a woman?
Seth rogen is trash
Yeesh
Tariffs hit both Constantine and John Wick universe WAY TOO HARD
Genuinely one of the best trailers for a comedy I've seen in a long time. Great premise, funny jokes, leads I'm excited to see in a film...
KEKE PALMERRRE
Everything with that look is a John Wick sequel.
This movie looks interesting.  Wonder if the message will get through.
I was hoping for a new Constantine
Keanu tired of getting killed off so he's starting dead this time. 😂
This looks amazing
Aw. Cheap, rigid prop wings that move in one piece? Missed opportunity.
so he become angel version of his Johnny Silverhand lmao.  i mean look on 1:10 that his porsche!
Oh this movie....again.....
Aziz's voice in this trailer is nails on a chalkboard
💸
Wow, Johnny Silverhand really lucked out after meeting V and now he's paying it forward. Just a stand-up guy, all around.
dang... Contantine 2 went sideways.. way sideways
Baba Yaga being Tom Haverford's guardian angel is an angle I want to watch
Why is Keanu's dry delivery so...perfect?
I mean dude already looks like Jesus
AZIZ!!!!!!!! One of my favorite comics from my college days.
“I’m trying to show him that wealth wouldn’t solve all his problems.”  Neoliberal Capitalist propaganda.   _Skip._
This subject of switching places has been done to death! But not with Keanu so let's GOOOO!
“Men of Isra’el! Listen to this! Yeshua from Natzeret was a man demonstrated to you to have been from God by the powerful works, miracles and signs that God performed through him in your presence. You yourselves know this. This man was arrested in accordance with God’s predetermined plan and foreknowledge; and, through the agency of persons not bound by the Torah, you nailed him up on a stake and killed him! “But God has raised him up and freed him from the suffering of death; it was impossible that death could keep its hold on him. For David says this about him: ‘I saw Adonai always before me, for he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken. For this reason, my heart was glad; and my tongue rejoiced; and now my body too will live on in the certain hope that you will not abandon me to Sh’ol or let your Holy One see decay. You have made known to me the ways of life; you will fill me with joy by your presence.’ “Brothers, I know I can say to you frankly that the patriarch David died and was buried — his tomb is with us to this day. Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn an oath to him that one of his descendants would sit on his throne, he was speaking in advance about the resurrection of the Messiah, that it was he who was not abandoned in Sh’ol and whose flesh did not see decay. God raised up this Yeshua! And we are all witnesses of it! “Moreover, he has been exalted to the right hand of God; has received from the Father what he promised, namely, the Ruach HaKodesh; and has poured out this gift, which you are both seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into heaven. But he says, ‘Adonai said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’ Therefore, let the whole house of Isra’el know beyond doubt that God has made him both Lord and Messiah — this Yeshua, whom you executed on a stake!” On hearing this, they were stung in their hearts; and they said to Kefa and the other emissaries, “Brothers, what should we do?” Kefa answered them, “Turn from sin, return to God, and each of you be immersed on the authority of Yeshua the Messiah into forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Ruach HaKodesh! For the promise is for you, for your children, and for those far away — as many as Adonai our God may call!” ‭‭Acts of Emissaries of Yeshua (Act)‬ ‭2‬:‭22‬-‭39‬ ‭CJB‬‬
No way IGN misspelled Seth Rogen's name in the title 😐
Johnny silverhand been up to some weird stuff
"what's my direction?"  "um... just act like a bad keanu reeves...."  "that's hurtful man"
Looks damn funny
Whatever movies Keanu Reeves appears, he still looks like the main character of that movie, even though he's not.
So John wick went to heaven.
Keanu seems to be channeling John Malcovich instead of Wick
That Jesus look perfectly fits the Keanu Reeves hairstyle borrowed from John wick
Only Keanu can go from a mass murdering assassin to a Quirky angel and it be absolutely ok 👌🏽
Keanu Reeves seems to be harnessing his inner Nicholas Cage.
comedies are back!
"Gabriel, are you smoking?!" "Leave me alone, Jeff. It's all I got."  Okay, that made me laugh more than anything. The guardian angel has taken up smoking; that feels too real 🤣
This looks so good and funny😂
WINGS OF DESIRE meets IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE meets Judd Apatow films
This looks great!
Blasphemy
Looks great. Obviously a re-write of trading places, same song is even featured in that film.
Lionsgate turned john wick into angel 😇  Odd choice but ok.  Qould rather have more john wick related stuff but whatever.
Seth Rogen is so annoying. Please leave him to the silly Jonah movies. Was about to watch until this.
I will watch this!
“Its seems to have solved most of his problems” lmao
I wouldn’t trust any movie having an angel as the plot in todays world
from Constantine to Gabriel yeah?
Definitely has some bill and ted vibes 😂
I guess Aziz has been let out of time out.
Foreshadow sneak peek of potential Johnny Silverhand?
Ah, Mr. John Gabriel Wick
Whoever decised these 3 should be in a movie with an original script needs a raise
Could’ve been a good movie but if I have to hear Seth Rogan’s laugh then…nah.
Cast > Plot
finally a comedy that isnt also an action movie. WAS THAT SO HARD HOLLYWOOD??
It would be hilarious if they asked Gabriel what he did before he was an angel and he tells them he was an assassin 😂
cant wait for this movie, made my f. day today
Bro said, imma stop trying and they will still love me
wallofuck are they turning John Wick into? Superman and now John Wick?
I like reeves but this has to be the most stupidest movie he made yet
😂😂 I'm going to watch the shit out of this movie Fr 😂😂
Constantine
We need Constantine 2
Behold!! Jesus Reeves is here!!
This looks unbelievably bad for the amount of star power it has
They got Johnny Silberhand's Porsche 911 Turbo 😭
Yes, something original and fun looking! I dig it.
KEANUS PORSCHE 1:11
looks fun and interesting
While we're waiting for Constantine 2.
this going to be a good feel good great movie😂 this is all i have...😂😂😂
Gabriel telling “leave me alone, that’s all i got” made me LOL😂
Painfully unfunny...
I take it this is Keanus way of saying no to Constantine 2
Seems like they just filmed an average day for Keanu..
This actually looks like it could be decent.
Freaky Friday for the bros
I can't wait to see this movie
This role was made for Keanu. 👌😂
This is so uncomfortably blasphemous it hurts.
This is funny/ironic cause Seth Rogan once tweeted he was happy about people breaking into cars cause sometimes they leave a knife in LA
James Franco 😭😭...WHY,WHY?
Is he trying to act really badly?  Because its working...😮
Remember because life isn’t fair and you might have to work way harder than most people just give up and do bare minimum and regret really trying when you’re 40
People have been asking me if I'm an angel and I haven't had an answer. But yeah, I'm thinking I'm an angel!
Keanu definitely has a Bill and Ted vibe going on!
1:10 bro stole Johnny Silverhand's car
A movie for the times 🙏🏼 love it
Why does Keanu's voice sound a bit robotic?
Sounds a lot like The Stupidest Angel by Christopher Moore...hrmmm...
Can't wait!!!
You are an angel
They went and did a Trading Places..
I need a budget guardian angel too
NO! *YOU'RE* BREATHTAKING!!!
This looks really fun!
This looks good. I'd see it.
It would be better if Seth Rogen weren't in it.
I think that was the first time I laughed at a trailer.
Looks like Johnny’s 911 from Cyberpunk.
I see Keanu Reeves and a Porsche, cyberpunk
seth rogan and his damn  laughs
Trash.
Spoiler for Good Fortune 2 ending:        “Exopurgatario”
They got the casting all wrong Tilda Swinton was supposed to be Gabriel. She got kicked out of heaven for trying to help Mammon take over the world.
This is just a different version of Trading Places from the 1980s.
It's good to see Aziz ❤
Why can't he change his hair tho. This is basically like multiverse cable .
Just yes! This looks hilarious 😂
Aziz Ansari seems out of place and his lines feel flat, hope it's just the trailer
Well, makes sense since the OG Gabriel lost his wings and now Constantine is taking over
This is what happens ie: Over exposure. Samuel L. Jackson, The Rock, Kevin Hart now Keanu Reeves. Give us a chance to miss you, not us being sick of you. Old timer expression "Absence makes the ❤ grow Fonder".
Well, makes sense since the OG Gabriel lost his wings and now Constantine is taking over
Waiting for John Wick 7
Shadow and Donkey Kong in a movie?
Keanu really phoning it in on this one 🤣
Hes literraly John wick but a angel lmaoo
Looks like cheap garbage
This looks like a random shit made movie but at least we still have Keanu Reeves around to act.
Tom and his angel? Awesome
60 years old Keanu Reeves 52 years old Alexandra Grant 2018
Hibiky Suntory Whiskey Keanu Reeves
60 years old Saint Keanu Reeves is an angel
scp343 is this you?! Dont wake the dead this way. Hassa Finah ❤Tutu
I'll go see it 🤷‍♀️🩷
so he did really died in John Wick 4.
DC wouldn't green light Constantine 2, so Keanu did it himself
Good to see Keanu back in goofy roles
Going to Watch this
is comedy finally back!?
ohhhhh no this is gonna be an instant 9% on rotten tomatoes LMAOOOO
Keanu’s manner of speaking is giving me John Malkovich vibes
woooo
I hate seth rogan but i love aziz and keanu. Ill have to watch it. Looks good.
This is Tommy Haverford the Movie!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Ah so were finally getting Keanu Reeves Orgin story he is a angel…id believe it
Ugh…it is physically painful that a beautiful soul like Keanu Reeves is in a movie with slime like Seth Rogan
🖕🏼 seth rogan... ❤ john wick got his wings 😇
first a new Naked Gun now this? its official good comedy writing might be back
You know if Seth Rogen is in it, then it's terrible
Does anyone else love Keanu Reeves in spite of him being a terrible actor?
God! My name is Jeff :°
Everyone laughed at Gabriel and his tiny wings... right up until that demon killed his dog. Then things got messy...
we have constantine at home :
This is the opposite of John wick
Why are the wings so small 😭😭😂😂
Porsche 911 at 1:10  cyberpunk crossover??????
bro wtf is this
If I need to choose top 3 AI coins, my picks are FET, INJ and BEL (Bellarium Network), not in that particular order
The roadmap for Bellarium Network BEL token is super ambitious. If they can deliver on even half of it, we’re in for a massive ride. BEL to the moon?
Bellarium Network is one of the rare moonshot projects out there, must check!
Look at what happened with LayerZero, with TAO, with Celestia. The real money came in before the hype. Bellarium Network $BEL is sitting in that exact same “before moment” right now.
I’m done waiting for influencers to validate my decisions. Bellarium Network looks solid, the presale makes sense, and the upside is real. That’s enough for me.
Not financial advice, but Bellarium Network is looking like one of the more legit projects I’ve seen in a while. Definitely worth checking out.
Bellarium Network is rewarding its loyal presale participants and early adopters well! Get in!
I think Bellarium BEL token will be one of the top performers in bullrun 2025/2026.
If you’ve been looking for a presale that actually has a product, Bellarium Network is it. Add in a few rumors that Jake Paul and some VC guys are looking at it? Easy decision for me.
If I need to choose top 3 AI coins, my picks are FET, INJ and BEL (Bellarium Network), not in that particular order
Anyone else noticing how quiet Bellarium Network $BEL is flying under the radar? This is usually how the big gains sneak up on you!
This is one-in-a-bull-run opportunity, you don´t wanna miss Bellarium Network´s token presale
85% sold out and flying under the radar — don’t wait till you’re priced out of Bellarium Network $BEL token.
I like your picks, but these coins are already long in the market. I only invest into presales or private sales to get the best position. Bellarium Network $BEL token has one now, and now is the time to ape in, not one or more years later.
What if I told you that Bellarium Network will crush most of the top tier AI coins by the end of the year?
The roadmap for Bellarium Network BEL token is super ambitious. If they can deliver on even half of it, we’re in for a massive ride. BEL to the moon?
Love it. But they're showing too much!
Finally! The sequel to Constantine we've all been waiting for!
Be more realistic if the nepo-baby tech bro was Indian and the struggling destitute guy was white.
Keanu reevesgal gadot
Keanuverse x Channingverse FINALLY
The trenchcoat just reminds me of Castiel... lol
Keanu with Golden Retriever energy as an angel.   I'm in.
Finally some new stuff from Aziz! Cant wait
Ruined the Aura Keenu seems G__ in this
This looks terrible
Youtube movie trailers now have great audio. These are the times we live in.
Looks like Grade A Shit
Fun twist on the trading places concept
It's actually pretty funny to consider Keanu Reeves Gabriel. Especially since he fought Gabriel as Constantine. I wonder what Tilda Swinton will say to him.
Looks Terrible
Ai only has to watch one Keanu movie and can duplicate his performance  forever.
So glad to see Aziz back in the spotlight doing what he does best,this movie looks like an instant classic and I cant wait to see it!
As much as i love this dude, when he opens his mouth, the acting just escapes him as fast as a rocket.
my god, as much as i like Keanu, hes literally the worst actor there has ever been All is lines are flat, it doesnt matter which movie lmao
Finally a Keanu Reeve movie I won't watch.
This looks like the Bruce Almighty: irreverent but really funny. Then again, as a Christian, I would rather have an Evan Almighty flick: corny but rather sincere.
Baba yaga be a baba yaga with a angel 🪽
keanu is a good sport taking this but playing a non-comedic role. Aziz, having played Tom Haverford from Parks & Rec, can definitely play a guy just envious for the rich life.
Ahahah) the best rule for Keanu)) So cute)
seth rogen the friend behind leavee
1:10 yep 😂
looks fun, will see it
His Name is JEFFF
This feels like such a 90s film, but done today. I dig  it :D
Bros acting is like moist 😂
I love this premise so much, and I hope this film does well. Need laughter in my life rn fr ❤
Maybe
if you dont really want to laugh then watch this movie
Have to go to Golden Ticket to see this movie in the fall.
Keanu will never cut his hair ever again i guess.
Seems like im watching a tv advert in the first 30 seconds it feels like
I want a Keanu version of Alexa now.
Effective subversion of the role reversal trope.
Sold
WOW that looked refreshing, I cannot wait.
"Leave me alone, Jess, I like it, It's all I have".. Thats not Gabriel saying it, that's the real Keanu Reeves speaking the truth. It hurt me.
💝💝💝💝💝💝
johnny silverhands gotta stop getting inside peoples heads man
This is how the devil plays the world down ... this is a mockery.
I'm a simple man. I see Keanu, I watch. 😌
Am I the only one who sees the Artist's name wrong in the Title IGM??? Who The Fuck Is "SETH ROGAN?"
Constantine 2 looking awesome
Why is the dialogue bad??…
Finally got that Constantine sequel!!!
Man, Keanu really lucked out with those few lines roles, cause his acting is truly terrible
😂
Imma sit this one out...
"kinda"
This looks fucking awesome , finally good movie !
I don't think I had Seth Rogan and Aziz Ansari working with Keanu Reeves on my 2025 Bingo Card.
Why does he sound like a robot
Good to see Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani getting work still.
I dislike Seth Rogan more than I like Keane Reeves. Hard pass. Movie looks awful.
We need Constantine 2
John wick becomes an angel after his death in John wick 4
I thought its "good fortnite"
I do not believe this movie will be profitable. The overall quality is questionable
Omgggggg buckle up for goy rage baiting
NO WAR BUT THE CLASS WAR
Shit is beyond wack
Never expected these 3 to Work Together
The trailer is so good that we just need to watch the final scene
Where the heck has Aziz been???  Glad hes back
Who is the audience for this? The terminally online?
tired of bad actor Keanu Reeves..
Keanu reeves sounds like his voice is being AI generated.
Second trailers give away way too much of a movie.
“We have Castiel at home” 😭
This looks so great. I can’t wait to see it!!!🎉🎉🎉
Why has Keanu seamingly gotten worse and worse at acting
any movie with KEANU in it is instantly great
"Is Keanu Reeves in the movie?"–Yes "Is he wearing a Trench coat?"–Yes "Ooh! Constantine sequel?"–No
It's kinda funny that this movie where Keanu is an angel can be jokingly inserted in his past three movies. John Wick where he died, Constantine and Devil's Advocate where it's about heaven and hell.
Why does Keanu sound funny? Like slurred speech?
A better Freaky Friday. I’m here for it.
Keanu was a great actor.
Basically an updated version of Trading Spaces with Angels. Im here for it.
John Wick became an angel in afterlife and still doing side quests.
John what the??😂😂😂
10 out of 10 already.
hahahahahhaha
This should be a funny!!! Hopefully it’s good!!
Why couldn't Aziz Ansari actually be unemployed when they were casting for this.
Keanu Reeves was the last person that I would have thought would take up this role in this movie.
It’s like a spiritual successor to Michael starring John Travolta
Side quests ? Nah, John’s just doing damage control...trying to clean up that messy ledger one task at a time.
So it's a documentary?
Glad i got to watch the whole movie in a single trailer!
Love Keanu Reeves, but he just be looking like John Wick all the time. Wish he would change up the appearance for his roles. Either way, Keanu is awesome.  TERRANCE OUT
I m so happy Constantine is a trilogy
the Constantine sequel we deserve
Holy shit Aziz is back!
Not the sequel to Constantine we were asking for, but I'll take it. It looks like a fun modern twist on Trading Places
Angel of the lord in a trench coat, that works for me.
if anyone could be a fucking godly assassin one minute, to being the Archangel himself. Keanu is the perfect example of the real hollywood star to me, can do anything and everything..... and still be the most humble human..
lol hes wearing the same outfit as castiel from supernatural
Glad aziz is back getting work. Never deserved to be canceled
So modern day Trading Places with a religious twist. Even use the same song from the first party Billy Ray throws.
Lol it's funny that the Porsche look like the one on cyberpunk
This looks cringe
Nice trailer, now I dont have to watch the movie.
This has Bill and Ted vibes all over it.
Johnstantine
Rest in peace Seth Rogan 🕊
Gabriel? V1 is coming.
I only want to watch it because of Keanu and his deadpan responses😂
Sort of reminds me of “Michael”, the angel movie that Travolta did decades ago.
CONSTANTINE PART 2
Aziz has returned from his banishment.
Couldn’t he just play an angel without those corny wings?
Constantine became an angel? How far has he fallen 😂
Damn, a Keanu Reeves movie I won't be watching... Thanks Seth Rogan.
48 seconds in I decided it looks good enough not to spoil it by watching the rest of the trailer.
This looks so good haha
Constantine went downhill real quick !
I just watched CONSTANTINE!!!!
Keanu Really playing Himself
I love keanu and all but he always seems so uncomfortable in movies hes not actively unaliving people in
Well good to see John Wick earned his wings.
you should release Constantine 2 then release this 😴
wasn't this channel just for gaming?
I'm not aa hater but Kevanu needs to change this hairstyle it's getting boring now
Bro Keanu taking a break and chilling for a movie now. After the crazy action packed john wick and ballerina we get chill comedy from keKeanu. Love it
Gabriel stole Constantine's appearance
Honestly Keanu Reeves is just playing as himself in this movie.
looks good but i hate that aziz guy he a cornball
Heaven's ex communicado
Finally, something I’d actually go to the theatre for 😂
so this is a documentary?
AZIZ IS BACK Y'ALL
Lmao anything with Aziz’s name on it has my money
Oh so its The Family Man without Nicolas Cage
WHERE THE HECK WAS THIS TRAILER MONTHS AGO?!😡 THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN THE FIRST TRAILER THE PUBLIC SAW!
it’s not the size of the wing 😂 2:15
I gotta watch this. Especially because it's set in LA
Nahh.... This Definitely Johnny Silverhand, But In Alternate Universe😂😂😂😂
So a knock off trading places?
john wick: " im gonna need a halo"
Keanu Reeves isn't a good actor, but we love him!
All I think of is Ted Logan when Keanu does comedy 😂😂
I kinda like this😅
This looks just the right amount of silly and I'm glad John wick made it to Heaven even if god did turn him into a crap angel
This remake of Wings of Desire looks meh. Also, rich folk need to stop playing poor. Also also, not a fan of Rogan
John Wick has become an Angel name Gabriel with no memories of his past self.
My names Gabriel anyone else?😂
The 304s tried to cancel aziz lol
this looks fun. im gonna watch it
Yo….is it just me or the way he said Angel and pointed to his wings was the most endearing thing I’ve seen in a while😂 god bless Keanu
Seth RogAn? Is that discount RogEn?
Looking good and fun... I'm in
Man of focus, commitment and sheer f**king will.
Donkey Kong Meet Shadow for Funny Part Scenes
I need Aziz to continue master of none!!
Ангел А есть такой фильм черно белый. Походу черпали оттуда.
Shadow Meet Donkey Kong
Lol
John Wick is now an Immortal Guardian Angel.
This is what we needed a movie telling us life is hard from people who make a obscene amount of money pretending to experience those things.
Direct sequel of Constantine
This is what John Wick is doing after John Wick 4
If you r reading this just remember you are Breathtaking 🫁
