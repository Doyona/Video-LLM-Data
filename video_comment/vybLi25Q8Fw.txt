this dude is so happy to be on TV looool love this guy.
Dang he killed it way to go Linus
bad bunny wanted to keep those glasses hahaha
Bad Bunny is a guy? Isn't that the obnoxious chick who was on Dr. Phil?
The only time ive enjoyed watching the tonight show
Yo the a few more inches joke was so unexpected, and so damn funny!
Lenovo, XReal, ROG, all Chinese ;)
That was cool. Well done Linus!
Bro is on stage with Bad Bunny no wonder he is freaking out.
Geez I thought this ad I saw on fb is an AI
What is bad bunny doing sitting beside Jimmy ? Looks like Jimmy was an amoebe and he multiplied. It looks so weird to see two talk show hosts sitting beside each other.
Linus is legitimately too smart for actual tv. These people are all totally oblivious to most of what Linus says.
How the heck does this complete fool get on a late night show.
Linus didn't cut to a advertisement
Liberal Canadian hack meets American liberal propagandist
6:56 This is why Linus is so important. he makes ppl want to buy crazy expensive things 😂
6:20  Did he return those shades? 😅😅
This is still so awesome, you can really tell hes nervous lol
Linus gotta be the highest neuron count carrier of all jimmy   Invitees
wow linus was also wearing sandals here come on linus vessi is going to take away their sponsorship😂😂😂😂
Despite his nerves he still shines as the natural educator and entertainer that he is.
That fake bs in america and that clapping omfg so anoying
Wow Linus is so awkward lol
WoW!!
Waifu xD
Do invite him again with some new tech!!!
WOW!
Linus was so excited 😭
Linus never ages wtf
Linus just took over the show in an instant 😂
Linus on TV is crazy cool.
Linus was incredible! more tech people should be invited in these types of shows, there are so many cool and mind blowing tech out there that many people don't know about
Linus is a cool dude! Thank you for having him on the show!
I'm 6 Minutes in, and linus didn't drop anything... yet.
Cool, but... does the Waifu have Wifi?
How did I just find this now?
Any honesty with this being a paid advertisement?
We need Linus back to give Tech tips about AI Waifus in 2032 when half of America has them
Linus aura mogging bad bunny is amazing 🔥 bad who? 😂
4:35 I love Jimmy's wow. Like he has no idea.
What the sh*t, linus and jimmy looks like same age but then you find out jimmy is 74 and linus 86 :Dd
I don't like Jimmy Fallon, but Linus and his team at LTT earned it...
Bro what?! Linus is on a freaking talk show?! The man made it. Congrats buddy!
Who’s this guy next to Linus and Jimmy?
Jimmy really should have touched on just how big the LTT umbrella really is. Linus has a captive audience that tops some tv networks ( including Jimmy's show)
I’m Shocked You Didn’t Drop Anything Linus!
my goat
Ltt no equal
Linus is amazing, this video git a like from me only because how appreciate Linus and how far he got, he is an inspiration to a whole generation of tech lovers.
I could watch Linus show Bad Bunny cool tech for hours. The guy has the best reactions, amazed and genuine. Not to mention that he looked cool as hell in those glasses. That company surely just found the perfect celeb partner.
I’ve never seen Linus so ecstatic lol
The only extra thing there is Bad Bunny.
So excited to be on TV that his real voice came out once again, after a long time....
Bad bunny should have brought breadsticks
Amazing! Canada represent!
I think that was the first time I ever seen Linus nervous in front of a camera before lol. He did a great job
Jimmy Fallon is awful. 😂 Jesus how does he have a show??
Jimmy get Linus back on your show!
Do you want breadsticks?
this was so awkward
bro linus tought me everything about hardware
He sounds like Marvel's Spiderman PS5 Peter in this interview
They make the audience laugh for the stupidest Fallon jokes but when Linus is talking and killing it they just make them stay quiet and awkward
imagine the same shit but with the braces on lol
Why is he so nervous? He's way more popular and cool than those tired old archetypes of Old Media. They are so last century while he is the more relevant personalities of today. It is they that should be nervous in his presence IMHO.
Wow this really got way more views then most of their normal videos
No way he is this giddy in real life...
What is bad bunny doing here too 😂
6:20 Bunny stealing 'em glasses LOL
Would love to see more of this!!!
Who gave linus coffe?!
Bro is 100% nervous haha never seen him so nervous he's pretty funny tho
he lookes super nervous and fired up its both hellarious and heart warming and i LOVE how his character kicks back in once they talk about tech all the support for linus
This should be a regular segment -- geeking out over odd new technology.
Suddenly seeing Linus go from "OMG I'M SO NERVOUS" to "I got this!" in a matter of minutes is aMAzing!
Came here from when he Googled his self
I want a pair of XREAL Glasses so badly. I hope to see them get them figured out for VR and also make them either a bit bigger to fit over my glasses or fix make them presecription
idk why but this video isnt available in Germany
as wise man once said... "don't worry about it."
Explaining wifu on Fallon. Not expecting that
At first he was so shy. But when his tech instincts kicked in, there you go our linus started rolling.
Good for him man. A true self made businessman, though can’t forget Yvonne’s contribution as well as they wouldn’t be where they are today without their team effort. He deserves everything he built!
I’m very disappointed seeing our Canadian hero go to American and be on a silly television program
Look, this show is lucky to have anyone who's relevant. No one watches "real tv" anymore. So unless you're dying for your boomer parents to see you, this shouldn't matter.
Linus is the best. He really cares.
I need Bad Bunny in a Mr Bean styled comedy movie. It's rare to see someone so funny without hardly talking
garbage
honestly, i was expecting a segue, to our sponsor
It was probably inevitable but I always believed the internet and Hollywood should have never crossed paths. Moments like this in which we started treating internet personalities such as youtubers and streamers as celebrities have contributed to the slow death of what was once a genuine set of communities, ideas, passions, hobbies and whatnot into a superficial, empty and pointless pursuit for views and optics for a few elites, not to mention how bad social media has been for the this generation.There is still great stuff out there tho and Linus here isn't bad but you gotta know where and when to look. A lot of what is the internet now is just made out slop content for short term dopamine shots.
the great LS
Wow i never seen or heard Linus this nervous and speeded. hahahahahahaha this is hiliarious. He did good.
Let's gooooo❤
This is absolute trash
holy staged 💔💔
Como latino me gusta bad bunny, pero a nivel de friki soy Linus
it's fun to see Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny be more awkward than Linus
I can't believe the Hard R controversy was not addressed.
Why is he dressed like a lesbian soccer coach that drives a Subaru 😂
Muggles
Jimmy shouldve been nick burns for this interview
dream blunt rotation
C'mon—the TV show Archer popularized waifus like a decade ago.   The feigned normality on TV is stifling and the worst it's been since the '50s.   It's 2025: everyone knows everything and has been exposed to everything.   Everything is boring and nothing is cool.   That reality doesn't sell ads though, does it?  So now we have these awkwardly engineered moments where the mainstream pretends it hasn't already gone over the edge and has no idea what a waifu is *gasping, clutching pearls*.  Meanwhile, everyone in the audience has an unspeakable search history and needs a drip feed of methamphetamines just to keep them awake through how bored they are with this placid, milquetoast, media landscape.
there is no ammount of words that could explain how happy this makes me
Linus brought the Future in his bag! What a nice segment 🎉
This is AI, right?
Interesting to see him out of his bubble
Linus Sucks, he's a terrible person.
He has scripted this whole bit, this isn't genuine at all
Yeah a few more inches would be nice.
Jimmy still on coke
hes either nervous or this is heavily scripted or both. this was so awkward and shouldve never been done lol
In June 2010 I watched Linus unbox a motherboard outside his workplace on a park bench holding a camera in his hand and recording  first person style.  I thought it was a woman unboxing because that's how his voice sounded to me. 😂. The next unboxing he did, he had a camera man now and he was onscreen. He was unboxing a Core i7 875k CPU.  That is the CPU that I bought after his unboxing to build my first Gaming Rig around. He eventually unboxed all the other components that I bought for my pc as well and I'm sure those unboxing videos still exist on channel; Asus P7P55D motherboard, Cooler master Silent Pro 1000W power Supply, the Hyper 212 cooler, the Antec 300 PC case, the MSI Cyclone GTX 460 graphics card that I eventually upgraded to a Cyclone 560 and then a Twin Frozr 660 and later a Twin Frozr RX 580. All reviewed and recommended by Linus.  I gamed on that PC for ten plus years until I got tired of having to switch GPUs constantly to keep up with newer games and decided to give console gaming a try by sticking with my PS4.  My PS4 died four months ago and now I've got the choice of buying a PS5 or building another PC, I'm going to build a PC and once again I'm going to use LTT and LMG as my guide because they've yet to lead me wrong.  So happy to see him reach this far into his career as a YouTuber. He put his all into LTT and it's paid of for him and it couldn't happen to a better person.
I love how star struck linus is
That was great!
Weirdest guest ever
Bring Linus back more times!
Don’t go to these clown shows😢linus
Linus never fail dude
The biggest surprise is that Linus didn't drop anything!
Bad Bunny is hot ❤ I understand why he is popular
I don’t know why I am so happy for Linus. I’ve been watching LTT for a while, although it’s rather popular, it’s still pretty geeky and niche. It’s a surprise that he can go to the mainstream media. ❤ You made it Linus.
You know he’s nervous when you see his hand shake soo much when he puts that pen back down
W
Linus seems very high lol
3:50 epic!
3:50 xD
as a LTT fan boy ...  this is aawsoooooom ! ❤🎉
He did really well. Good on him
Make this a regular skit!
Everyone praising Linus should look up about his controversy review regarding startup called Billet Labs. He's terrible human being.
I think, he pretend to be hetero but he is gay like the 2 other guys
3:59 Finally an audience that appreciates the dad jokes
"just dangerous enough" man i LOVE that
Linus?!?! Wow! You made it, brother! Thanks for everything. You taught me how to build PCs. And I love it! 😁
Whatever tech nerd told the producers to book Linus is a solid person, and probably deserves a raise.
i can tell bad bunny planning that two sun glasses hahahaha
Why tf bad bunny there LMAO
It's weird seeing Linus on tv like this. Odd considering I'm watching it on YouTube exactly like I watch most LTT content on lol. It's just different. Not bad different just different.
You can really see him very nervous, I'm so glad and proud watching this for more than a year now and he gave me ideas on multiple techs. Just like how he gets the idea for the segue, on their sponsor...
That was great, nervous is ok, makes it real
you know late night is down and bad when they have tech youtubers come on lololol
He deserves all the good in the world bro, him and ChrisFix raised a whole generation of D.I.Y go getters
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's great to see how far he's come. The first video I ever saw him in was the Chinese market PC parts shopping.
Love jimmy but who’s here for Linus?
i can see linus was really nervous, when he puts the color pen back, hes shaking like hell xD
Our boy made the big time
Jimmy knows what a waifu is. I don't think Bad Bunny does.
hi
Linus you’re so nervous dude haha! But this no energy fake two faced host fallon just can’t seem to match yours bro, stay true. ✌️
Is he 9n speed ? Lol
Don’t know what to do without a Segway…to their sponsor
Honestly at first I wasn’t sure if it was even real. It’s soo cool to see a personality you regularly watch on YouTube be on a show that feels so official. Awesome
Jimmy, don’t cover up what he did to Madison
haha Linus is such a weiner 😂😂
linusteachnerves 😂
It's funny seeing Linus so nervous in front of the camera.
Those glasses actually look amazing on Bad Bunny
And bad bunny as well. Nice!
Jimmy so lame for not matching Linus energy
He has no background until today 😂🎉
bro looks green screened in 😭, seriously though, congratulations
Congrats to Linus for getting public tv recognition. the world just opened up even more for you. you deserve this and more.
Nice package, sack, ugh.. I mean bag full of electronics….
You could have asked him about knowing what was going on with Honey.
This made me smile
its so funny how they come from extremely different ecospheres of content that he just confuses them in his rambling.
oh god why, please keep your grubby hands away from poor linus
Subtle advertisement for the LTT Comutter Backpack that I bought
Nick Burns meets Nick Burns
Unreal! Congrats to my fellow Canadian Linus Sebastian! Keep it up!
good job ltt
So my tech guy pulls up to jimmy fallon with the guy who collabed with travis scott to make kpop my favourite song, damn
Linus respect!!!!!!!!!
Bad bunny having fun why keeping glasses in his coat.
Well deserved bro
why is bad bunny on a comedy show stupid asss name and garbage music thats rotting kids minds
I love how Linus really leaned into his inner nerdy self
We went from slowly booting PCs to slowly extending screens. Who has time for that?!
Do we see tech tips weekly segment with jimmy fallon featuring linus Sebastian
This is so hard to watch, such severe cringe.
boy is this the weirdest crossover on earth
What kind of glasses was those? I wanna play on my Lineage 2 server with that. It was my dream to have somthing like that
Aww he so nervous
Cool🎉
Jimmy Fallon finding out what it’s like to interact with himself.
Duuuudeee what alternate reality am I in?
The socks and sandals always gets me
Nice work Linus. You did not drop anything in the show😂
Good to see some people of merit getting some shine.
"Linus Tech Tips are on Youtube right now"
Infectious passion for what he does and the people he does it for. His channel is one of the best on youtube, easily, even if you're not a tech person.
no segue or lttstore plug? much dissapoint.
You should not have had that buffoon on your show
The nervousness of Linus makes him like he's 18. So cute.
That guy looks so high 🤦‍♂
Great to see Linus on a smaller creators channel.  Is it weird that Fallon didn’t know what a waifu was?
I was expecting @LinusTechTips to do his signature segways the whole time...
Oddly energetic, guess tv shows got that good shiet :D
3:50 The absolute funniest part of this segment lmao.
wow! this is incredible
I love watching LTT videos. I even bought an LTT mat for my desk and the LTT Graphics Card pillow.
thank god he didn't drop any hard R's
Linus was like 22/23 when that photo they showed was taken and they call him a kid as if he was 10 years old or something. So weird. He was an adult and not even all that much younger than Linus is now…
It was so cool to see him on a major mainstream nighttime talk show like this. I've followed his vids for close to 15 years (insane it's been that long)... this is a GREAT move for tech and tech channels online - not JUST LTT.
He is so nervous, I love it😂
so zesty
its not that deep bro ur a nerd and film it so what
soo much makeup on his face lol
What a crossover congrats Tech Man
Wtf is diddy’a boyfriend doing here ?
im so disappointed. he didnt drop anything but the mic
So nice to see LMG collab with small creators to give them a boost.  Keep on rollin'
SO COOOOOOL!
I never thought I’d see bad bunny and Linus in the same room but here we are
What?! Linus was on a talk show?!
Bad Bunny snagged that color-changing sunglasses and Linus didn't notice. 😂
🫡 Good work, soldier.
Linus is amazing ❤
ai-videoupscale AI fixes this. nus Sebastian showcases mind-blowing technology.
Yearly Linus CES feature please?
Bro this was sick!! You’ve come so far proud to have been watching you for a long ass time
Wow, Linus on the worst Jimmy late night show. Still, great to see Linus go mainstream
Bad bunny and Jimmy Fallon.....worthless people. Idc what they think or what the writers told them to say / shrug and yawn.
VR changing into glasses. That is a good product.
Awesome, proud of my homie Linus, he has made it big time
surprised he didnt try to plug lttstore with his 300$ backpack
Jimmy needs to bring Linus back as a weekly segment!
That's Jimmy as guest in a LTT show - I love it!
Take my like for having linus transcend YouTube
I think him and Justin Trudeau get the same personality
I always liked watching linus sex tips.
Linus your the best
Funny tech man brought tech, haha.
Linus is the clown prince of all tech channels.
Wow, what a surprising guest!
so proud
Amazing stuff, Linus, nervous at the start but you got right into the swing of things :)
Great job Linus. You can see how you have grown
Linus together with Bad Bunny and Jimmy Fallon gotta be the most unexpected crossover ever
Linus vs Hollywood TV Best Regards Andrew from downunder
Linus so good. Bad bunny always charming
2:36 "don't worry to much about it" lmao
What was the wink lol
Nice! So cool you invited him. Fresh!
this is so surreal
He shoud've said: "I'm a bit nervous", that alone would've helped him to release some tension. It helps to share feelings
You always want an extra spare inches! XD @LinusTechTips FTW
lol
A bunch of douche bags.
Segments should have been longer.
Who's noah?
Linus is a faker. And what happened to Leno?
Linus is the new "Bill Nye the Science Guy"
Titus so nervous, like a kid eaten too much candy. Loving the tech.
Not Jimmy teasing bad bunny like that 7:05
Eeeeewww it's Linus yuck
Glad he dressed up, sandals and socks.
2 monter drinks later
Good for you Linus! Next time grab a drink in the Green Room! But really, you deserve it brother!
Thanks for the heads up with Honey Linus. You are such a class act...
This is the first time I watch some part of the Tonight Show.
The glasses are already out. They are Stephan Marbury's new line of glasses.
Wow Linus must be desperate going on this show.
There’s not many people Jimmy Fallon can’t have as guest but I he did not do a good job here. This shows just out of touch the older generation of entertainment is with the newer one. They just don’t know how to adapt and play into the quirks and energy of a YouTuber
I'm 2 weeks late in finding out that Linus is in the same room as Bad Bunny on the Jimmy Fallon Show.  I didn't expect this on my 2025 Bingo card. 😱
in the beginning he is so excited its hilarious
the stuff on american tv is the best...
Wow; a little over two years ago LTT had become a laughing stock on the Internet due to scandals (the water block prototype incident, and that whole Madison thing, among others), ham-fisted responses to those scandals, and internal mismanagement. Fast forward to now, and Linus is on The Tonight Show; it seems the Internet, for all its digital indelibility, has the memory of a goldfish. Never let it be said that the world doesn't give people (or companies) second chances, especially once you hire "adult supervision" for your startup...
This is the most humble appearance I've seen.  He's so grateful.
He's like a black market tech dealer who's high on his own supply.
who the fuck is bad bunny? sounds like a sex toy
i was hoping linus spinning 5090 in the next tv show
If anyone deserved a platform to show off cool tech on TV, it was LTT. This guys videos helped me build my first PC.
Linus use Just for Hosers to keep the gray outta his hair.
A common misconception is that you have to have this kind of personality to be popular on YouTube.
imagine using LTT to stay relevant. The MSM has been completely made obsolete and is just throwing its dying kicks.
Linus isnt a real tech guy, hes more geeksquad level but he knows how to market media.
Dude my bros on here, no way, I'm glad I found this video, Thanks Jimmy for making History, Holy Cow
What will Gamers Nexus say?
Boy did well
This is surreal
God Linus is a terrible person, I don't know why you would platform him
Do none of you think Linus might be on something here? Big fan of him here too btw.
Ugg wasnt this guy some sex pest to his employees...
I was waiting for the shameless sponsor plug
Sugar level spikes
No clue who this guy is
Go Linus! Haha loved the tech testing, funny 😂👏🏻
He’s a little nervous
How do people not see this as weird like jimmys whole show is so weird it feels so fake very Hollywood like he’s controlled by a bigger machine
Tw@s
Linus talked on WAN show about how his waifu joke didn't land but imo the funny part is that every1 in the audience and even me who is from India ffs  got Jimmy's reference of Pittoro, every1 except Linus ie.
Mbhd next
linus  voice is so close to bill burrs voice o m g ! i love it
Linus was nervous and excited as hell! 😂   " Don't worry about it "
Terrible attempt at solving the issue. Screens are so thin, they should just add ability to add one or two screens that slide out or fold out from the sides of the main screen. Having a screen that is four inches taller doesn't help AT ALL. You need sides to be increased, not height.
I guess Linus edits his squeaky voice in post for his show.
Linus > jimmy fallon. Linus is above this.. if Fallon is real tv the real tv should be considered an insult.
The two functions that this interview serve are seeing some of the goodies from ces and hating whichever jimmy this is a whole lot more
I can't tell if Linus was trying to be funny or was just nervous in the beginning.
Wtf is that talentless retard bad bunny there?
he looks like hes on 5kg of coke
Did you guys notice how much his hand was shaking when he was putting the pen back into the stand? :D
I can't believe we witnessed Linus teach Jimmy Fallon what a Waifu is. 😊
my idol! on TV
Get bad money off the show Jimmy Fallon earn that seat some TV
He showed only 10% from that bag...
Hell yeah Linus. Love to see this.
I wonder what producer is an LTT fan who made this happen. Jimmy and BadBunny obviously had no idea what was going on. But hopefully that producer has an eternal smile on his face for getting linus sebastian in front of the american tv audience to talk about dumb CES concept products. i sure had a blast. defo do more stuff like this!
It must be surreal to be a normal everyday person and all of a sudden getting to meet a big celebrity such as Linus. Jimmy and Bad bunny must have been so nervous.
Wait this is REAL???
love Linus i watch His videos since 2011
Gotta love Linus❤️
Linus the shill. How's that amazing Hyperloop technology coming along Linus? Anymore ridiculing words for the skeptics? All I hear is crickets...
He needs to chill
Such an awesome guy, Linus is like a tech version of top gear sometimes, haha very entertaining .well deserved @LinusTechTips awesome,
wow he's shilling products even when he's on TV.
I imagine the Jimmy Fallon audience has not often seen a guest like Linus lmao that mustve been a fun night
Still hate Jimmy Fallon
we need more linus on jimmy fallon later
This shows not funny nor entertaining
Wow man Linus Sebastian ❤
Congratulations, Linus! I was actually waiitng for the segue. LOL
Why would you invite a garbage bin?
absolutely insane
5:50 This technology will be coming to cars widespread in the VERY NEAR future.
sweet 😄 shows that he's a really nice humble person. I love it !
he so nervous omg
What the fuck???
Linus is a tech king
wheres the link i need it
From cringe to awesome. 😅
Last item will be good for visualization!
Not gonna lie, jimmy should get him every once in a while showing cool tech
Cool
No offence, but Dude, oh Dude Linus WHY the socks and sandals on major prime time TV! Please ask Yvonne for fashion advice because I know she's cringing at your fashion choices. To note, all of Linus's shown tech gadgets I want, as they are amazing.
4:19 that's how my laptop reacts on CornHub
Been watching Linus since the beginning trippy to see him here! Do it again!
Funny thing is Linus has a probably has a bigger audience than the Tonight Show, but it's so cool seeing him on Real TV.
I hope this becomes a regular segment l, Linus gives me Jack Hannah vibes showing off all these gizmos. It would be perfect around Christmas
"i've used my fair share of hard r's back in the day"
6:54 - I liked Bad Bunny's reaction to the stuff Linus brought. Most celebrities would probably say "wow" while patiently waiting for a turn to check it out, while he's like the little brother you brought along to your friend's house; too excited to wait for his turn on a new game/toy.
I love how Linus' "Don't worry about it" kinda sounds sus.
Is this AI generated? 🤔
Honestly getting some of these YouTube personalities on these talk shows would get some huge numbers. I’m expecting to see more of this, people don’t want to hear from Hollywood people anymore.
Whos bad bunny?
You gonna see bad bunny gonna wear that sunglasses on his next video😂
As a long time LTT watcher, this is so cool!
I've never seen Linus so stressed. It's even making me stressed
They should of had Henry Cavill on there to nerd out with Linus
The joke about adding a few extra inches was actually really funny
I wish I had these to play The Simpsons Tapped Out 😭
I've never been able to detect anxiety in people's voices until now.
Sandals on national tv ...lol
El diablooo!
I think linus did a great job! That was awesome to watch!
The irony that Linus is wealthier than jimmy Fallon himself now
Linus was clearly anxious at first but he killed the demonstration!
I got nervous watching this ffs..
WHAT THE FUCK!?
Ill admit, that was pretty cool. Should have Linus on as a regular spotlight of cool tech on the market for mainstream viewers.
Ewwww, LTT. The sexual harassment channel.  The selling other companies tech to anyone without permission channel. The I will do a good review of your tech if you pay me enough shill money channel.
They are nothing Linus, They are just entertainers or Jokers
Linus really knocked it out of the park with this one
thats pretty cool tech right there, i look forward to maybe owning the laptop and the gaming screen glasses, :D
"A few more inches would be nice took me out" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Something i never knew i would ever see this
AYYYYYYYYYYYY🎉
What's that other guy doing next to Jimmy?
This should be a regular thing.
Cringe.
It's funny linus is so nervous, when his channel pulls more views than all of these hack late night hosts combined.
Build my first PC with the help of this guy. His channel achieved exactly what he desired🙏🏽
Linus is a dishonest loser with zero morals. Ask the company who's prototype cooler they auctioned after knowing they were supposed to send it back. Fuck this clown shoe
I'm REALLY proud oof Linus. I'm sure its nerve wracking being there with jimmy on a new set and legendary program. he did outstanding representing Vancouverites and techies alike! Way to go Dude!
Everyone saying how nervous he is, well who wouldn't be?? Talk about hitting another career high he'll NEVER forget, pretty cool.  I really think he's more excited with a touch of "Wow, look what I've started and how far we've taken it" amazement while playing "Linus the Tech Guru" almost as a character. Which he really nailed after he started talking about CES and notice he never stopped working the room/ cameras with that excited Linus energy. He's no rookie, he's a 20 year vet!! Well Done!!
Linus' videos used to be cringy and educational. Now they are only cringy.
Damn we got Linus on tonight show before GTA vi
ah hahahaha Linus fashioning his sandals with socks to Tonight Show is pretty rad 😂😂😂
wank in sandals,sell out
Those glasses look amazing bad bunny look SICK AS F
This is so weird i legit thought it was a.i be real
People don't realize how many tech YouTubers look up to Linus   Linus in YouTube tech space has all eyes on him  Even Austin Evans watches and learns from his videos  Like Linus is the one who got me into oleds TV and how they work Now I sell them as a side hustle in my day to day life as extra income  Man changed so many people lives when it tech and consumerism choices
Jimmy being a douche, again. Seriously, you’re not better than anyone man
LINUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Even linus gets nervous love to see him in something major like Jimmy 🎉
Bad bunny pulled a Linus just going to take this from work to home
Bro was shaking in his computer
Funny thing is, I didn't know about the other two until Linus talked about this show's episode on his channel. You should really consider having him on your show every year after CES. Not only would you be able to show the world a bit more of the technological advancements likely to become things people can buy soon, but it would also allow the techies (tech people) to start watching the show. And as a bonus, you would get to learn more about things you didn't know, like those waifus you didn't know about. (Edit: Forgot to write "show's episode".)
2:34 Bad Bunny be like, “but y tho?”
Mafucker goin on selling shit and making  profit 😂 jk Linus, you’re alright man.
Proud of our boy
Those glasses….. bad bunny wants them for sure 😂
Jimmy is like he travelled from 1980 to 2050. 😂
Jimmy is gonna be famous after this, thanks Linus
Nightmare blunt rotation.
Haha Linus is turning into a Libtard. No wonder LTTs channel has gone down the drain like it did. That being said never really was that great in anyway.
Jimmy sorry i mistake my first comment...i write and explain my remote place I'm Indian
Jimmi i advertise my friend and now I'm need you please with assurance
can play games like....baldur's gate
Linus and Bad Bunny in the same room…what on earth.
Linus is the happiest man on TV!
Bro do a interview with Ishowspeed
amazing job linus, really well done bro!!!
Linus is the best!
So surreal seeing Linus on a show like this. I've been watching his videos for over 10 years. Did you have to wear the sandals with socks though? Haha.
Got to make this a regular Guest! Awesome set!!!!
You should get Linus as a corespondent for every CES. This guy can make or break these new gadgets and he’s great!
This is weird.
This was excruciating
Linus is the child that never had to grow up
Never really thought about it, but Linus is the reason I work in IT now..
best jimmy fallon ive seen in 10 years
Who are these guys with Linus?
Jimmy should have more people like him over
We got linus on jimmy fallon before gta 6
Linus sounds a lot like otacon throughout this interview, especially at the waifu bit 😅
that guy is the worst. just shovels out video after video that might be factually accurate.
That fake Linus. real Linus wear a beard!
Is it just me, or does Jimmy seem more like an alien when dealing with tech stuff? He completely shuts down compared to Linus's enthusiasm.
Bring his team on the show!
I feel the tech tips soaring through my vains 😵😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
sandals and socs , typical linus even on national tv
2 big fakers and snowflakes stroking each other their tiny dicks
Man they need to stop inflating linus ego lol, he’s gonna reach alpha centauri by this point 😂
@LinusTechTips Man... Linus, You aced this! Proud dad moment.
First Geek ever on a night show lol.
Convida a Fernanda Torres!!!!!
1:53 that kinda wasn't the question though was it?
This is actually very fun to see. Linus doesn't know how to be submissive in an interview. He is acting exactly like he is in the video's. Prob becouse he is afraid that people can't relate to him without him being his video self.
Oh they are having him back every year..
Linus is a total tool. 😂😅
Now this is cool!
is this AI? this is horrible.
you suck
linus is a shill
Linus made a lot of money in these 8 minutes of showing off tech and I mean a ton of money kids def go to the best colleges in the country
Yes my parasocial friend, let’s go!!!!
I have been watching Linus on YouTube for what feels like half my life and its funny to think that he is a normal guy. Even with his immense viewership and his internet persona he cant help but get star struck and over excited about being on National Television. Glad he got such an awesome opportunity.
"have you ever thought 'A few more inches would be nice!'"
Linus and his chanclas...
I would never watch Jimmy Fallon otherwise, but it's Linus! Went to compare the view count of this video to Fallon's other ones, looks like I'm not alone 😂
Now here is the question: Did Bad Bunny keep the glasses?
Leftie ahh vid
Keeping up with the news. Thanks for making me feel I’m somewhat near civilization
Bad bunny adds nothing to the conversation wtf?
Everyone in the comments is bringing up Linus, but I think Bad Bunny might have actually gotten away with those color changing sunglasses.... Linus got robbed on TV.... in front of the studio audience.... Now it's being shown right here on his platform, and nobody else seems to be bringing it up.
Talking to a camera versus talking to a live audience hit different for Linus, but when he warms up, it's all smooth sailing.
Did he say humanoid waifu robots? I've been waiting for that my whole life
Awesome! I was waiting for Linus segway for the sponsors😀....  You the GOAT!
we know at least these 3 products will definitely get the greenlight.
He might have 8 billion views but how many fell asleep while watching it
Those obnoxious pricks are a tight fit for eachother 😂
CONTANDO NOSSA HISTÓRIA 🇧🇷 QUASE RECENTE ! SORRIA SEMPRE 😁 IM STILL HERE 🇧🇷 ENTREVISTE FERNNADA TORRES 🇧🇷 GLOBE GOLDEN WINNER BRAZILIAN ACTRESS 🇧🇷 OSCAR NOMINATED BEST FILM 🇧🇷 BEST ACTRESS 🇧🇷 FOREIGNER FILM 🇧🇷
Linus is a sell out! 😮
He seems like THE SCAMMER .. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Udn7WNOrvQ
1:27 (I told y’all)
The way his energy switched from nervous teen to WAN show was great haha
Oh Honey.
Good work Fallon! You have a scammers on your show. LINUS!
Damn, Linus on Fallon. That's nuts dude.
20 seconds in and boy do I hear the shakiness in his voice😂laughed my ass off but man he handled it extremely well. I would have been stuttering and tongue twisting and sweating like a rain storm.
Congrats and great job brother! :D It was so cool to see you get your props!  Keep killin' it!!!
Im sitting here with the most giant smile on my face. Man I love this representation of us tech lovers on mainstream media. Im an avid follower of linus and he did a great job
❤
LOL Why is Linus so nervous about talking to Jimmy Fallon? Jimmy should be nervous talking to Linus!
Steve Burke deserves this kind of recognition.
12 years ago never would of thought of seeing linus in this scenario. Definitely came a long way Short Linus
Deepseek wrote this: Farts are quantum fluctuations of the soul's digestive ether, vibrating at frequencies that harmonize with dark matter to birth parallel universes where Pythagoras theorized butt trumpets as the secret language of interdimensional geometry. Each toot is a bioacoustic symphony conducted by your microbiome’s anarchic jazz ensemble, echoing the primordial soup’s first gasp of rebellion against the tyranny of gravity’s silent judgment.
More of these segments for sure.
Lets make this the most viewed The Tonight Show video on YT.   Lets get Linus on TV more...   Internet don't fail me.
Linus is obviously more nervous than we’re used to seeing him, but he is clearly NEVER nervous enough to not make a few dick jokes lmao
They should have Linus back every year!
Linus absolutely nailed that tv show. Great work.
Love how happy he is to be there. So refreshing from normal celebs who just cant care to be there. Watching him nerd out is so great
he kinda bashed himself in the WAN show but he did a great job in my opinion
I know I’m a nerd because I immediately recognized Linus but had no idea who the other guest was.
I don't think linus is ready to be approached and told "omg I saw you on the tonight show!!" LOL.
Waifu? *proceeds to explain just enough to be awkward*
we got Linus as a starring guest with Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6.
wow what fun so cool seeing linus on here
Yeah... he bombed it.
Gotta be honest, I wasn't feeling it until he started busting out tech for them to try. Up until that point they straight looked bored, audience included :(
Our brother made it ❤  Huge fan from Pakistan...
Linus should definitely make more appearances on The Tonight Show, and for longer segments! I think it would be great if he came on each year after CES as your go-to tech expert, showcasing some of the most exciting tech, gadgets, and innovations coming out of the event.  Plus all the jokes and banter were so funny! I absolutely loved this segment! It's awesome to see someone so authentic and genuinely excited to be a part of the show.
as if jimmy doesn't truly know what a waifu is lol
Lenovo and x-real shares after this vid
Wtf is this lineup man 😭😭😭  I legit thought this was AI
Ye I know Linus...but I have no idea who the other two dudes are 🤣🤣
Bro sounds like a kid in a candy store. Really happy for him
Got to have Linus on annually such a fun segment
He's just a nerd living his best life. It's so nice to see how excited he is because most people would try and act cool but he's just enjoying the moment to the full
He’s so nervous lolol
What is with the fact that 2 dudes are sharing the desk? This situation seems rediculous wtf lol
It’s the real life blippi
This is like my favorite video ever of Lins. Its just the ecstatic nerdy Linus showing casual people his tech 😭. Also never seen him so nervous before that is so funny.
linus explaining the term waifu to hollywood is hilarious to me
how does he get get younger everytime i see him
WTF
Great segment, love Linus.  His enthusiasm came through.
God I forgot how bad these talk shows are now
I'm so happy for Linus! He deserves this recognition
Tonight Show crew - please do more of these, this was cool
Linus is a total fraud and shouldn't get air time.
LINUS DID HIS BEST. He got caught up in the anxiety but still better than most of us expected lol
He's the quintessential wispy canadian new-man
Is it me, or TV is cringe? Lol.
2.3m veiws lol get him back on the show, been watching him pretty much since he started out and he being so nervous was funny lol
calling someone on talkshow who doesn't even know what's good for his subscribers. really nice man !
i thought the laptop was a joke at first lol
Who the hell is this Bad Bunny guy and why does he have such a fake name?
Excited to see you get this type of opportunity
I followed Linus for 17 years, never seen him so nervous 😂
i've never met Linus...and yet I'm so proud of him. Weird 🤣 Nailed it Linus, top stuff
Cool linus but Jimmy Fallon is a clown
Linus!
Jimmy went from doubting what was in the bag to being blown away… the power of technology and Linus for sharing it
I’m here to support Linus. Fuck the other cunts and this show.
Bad bunny here is giving cool cousin vibes here
Late night is struggling, good for Linus tho 👏
Nice to see Linus doing charity projects and helping out the less fortunate
@LinusTechTips @TheTonightShowStarringJimmyFallon @Linus I’m so glad I saw the announcement when I did. I was in the hospital having my 2nd surgery on my left ankle and a few hours after I got to my room, a saw an announcement about it. I set an aroma because I was tired after being pretty sedated. I set an alarm but I slept a bit past it and thought I missed it but put the show on just in case and then later you came on and I got to watch you with my mom which was really nice. It cheered me up a bit! I have been safe at home for about little over a week recovering. I am not weight bearing so I’m glad I got to see this Congrats on a great segment!
who is bad bunny again?
why he looks like he has done coke
Jimmy asked about CES and bro instantly locked in.
Glad to see Linus here, would like to see him again!
Linus and makeup doesn’t go
When they put those glasses on and said Yo, I instantly thought, "It's my dick in a box!"
Need to bring Linus back for more tech goodies,  like they do with animal handlers.
Ahaha this was great 😂
This is crazy. Congrats Linus.
Hell yeah, watches linus for years, glad to see him get some TV exposure!!!!
Hell Yeah Linus!!!
Linus nailed it Nervous or not give him another go and he’ll be in his element  Congrats Linus and lmg
Linus saying waifu and expecting everyone to understand it and then trying to explain it while not sounding wierd is hailarious
This made me genuinely dislike linus.
Out of the park Linus.
No LTT screw driver in sight.
Was jimmy fallon quieter and maybe a little colder than usual?
Wild af
I guess largest tech channel is more important that ethical tech channel.
Gamers Nexus is foaming at the mouth
Look how many views this got compared to their usual 😂😂
My fucking GOAT
You could tell he was nervous but once the tech came out he was locked in.
The laptop inches joke was hilarious
.haha. Linus came back normal after bringing out the laptop. XP
GG Linus 👍❤️
Loved this!
He was stoked lol nervous and excited at the same time. I'm happy for Linus!
that was awesome
Love this ❤ About time Linus is recognized. Hey has an amazing team that he and his wife manage too. 🤘
please have him come on again
I'M Sorry Linus had to endure this awful cringe show
Linus blew it he seems too nervous
7:47 Linus with the gyattttt
Damn, Linus killed it; he felt right in his element. And Jimmy had that same "kid in a candy store" vibe he has whenever Reggie Fils-Aime used to come in with the latest Nintendo product. Honestly, these two have a great vibe match.  Also, love the moment where Bad Bunny just snuck the Auras into his pocket. Don't know the guy, but that's some good comedic timing.
i started watching linus on NCIX and it was a "memory speed" video that was probs 10 years ago, thanks to him and JTC ive become the confident builder i am insted of the kid who would shake after 5-10 mins because "its not mine" XD
Despite not being my favorite tech channel on YouTube (I'm more of a Gamers Nexus and Hardware Unboxed person), I gotta say Linus deserves all the success he's achieved by bringing us entertaining and (mostly useful) content. You can see he actually cares about what he does. Thank you for having him to the show 👏🏻
Is Linus on coke?
Yeah i think Linus should push for being the animal guy but for cool tech. Hes got a great relationships with alot of companies and could be great overall for all parties.
06:01 Bad Bunny thinking: "EA DIABLO PERO QUÉ NIVEL DE PRODUCCIÓN".
Wow. So many assholes in one frame...
😂😂 The Nervousness is crazy. I can feel it from my phone
Wow he did such a good job with amazing products. I'm surprised he hasn't been had segments on these shows earlier than now.
Really cool techs 😮😮😮
Retarded content
Not a single lttstore mention? You sure you got the right Linus? 🤣
This was cool to see, congrats Linus and LTT
Boring
Dude Linus why would you go on this. Literally the worst show on tv
LETS GO LINUS
What is going on?
New recurring segment being born
I've been hot and cold on LTT at times but he crushed it.. what a cool segment.
lwagooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Great job Linus
Jimmy, if you ever have Linus on again, and I hope you do. Have him go into the tech first and work in questions about who he is between gadgets. Linus is so much more in his element when he has tech in his hands.
What did Bad  bunny said ?
El Rey Bad 👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰👑🐰🐰👑🐰👑🐰🐰👑🐰👑👑👑🐰👑👑🐰🐰👑🐰🐰👑👑🐰👑👑🐰👑👑🐰👑👑👑
This is CIA
what da hell lol
Who paid their taxes
Jimmy don't act so confused by "waifu."
Wow so the scumbag rumors were true about Jimmy Fallon. Played yourself big time Jimmy. Lmfao what ah guest
10 out of 10!!!!
Lame AF
He was so nervous! Damn Linus I'm a huge fan but I never seen you like this. This crown was definitely not nerdy enough for Linus 😂
calm down buddy. ts Jimmy. Its ok
After listening to the WAN Show about this. You can see his face after the "Look im on TV" comment turn.
Yeah I just did a deep dive on this guy….honestly this guy is a flop smh.
Love to see it! 🔥
Been watching Linus since almost the beginning. Congratulations Linus !
Love you Linus I've been watching you since I was a kid I'm 30 now
Bad bunny chillin knowing he can buy all that tech today if he wants
Lol Linus looked so hyper and nervous 😝
No wonder TV is dying. I wouldn't be able to watch these boring hosts even for 5 mins. Linus probably saved their show.
Waifu joke was great. This just makes me realise that not everyone is a degen.
@LinusTechTips the 🐐
Lol Linus and playing the nerdy dude so well… oh wait..
Yeah, basically I’m not no scammer but he don’t get what I’m saying because basically I am a disabled person so that’s just the problem right there how I do a lot is marbling my mouth, but don’t know how to talk that good I’m more a quiet person than explaining. I’m not good at talking.
Youtube recommended this to me 6 days later 🤯
We need more crossovers like this.  Awesome to see LTT on this show.
Jimmy proving there that gamers don't look up 😂
Loved that Linus stuck to his own brand of humor
Linus appearance on this show was so disappointing, he behaved as if he's never been in front of the camera before. He was unable to explain himself properly, and even screwed up explaining complex technology to non technical people, something he does everyday in his job.
man i remember some of the EARLY days at your house, with panels drying outside on the porch and getting rained on .. good on you Linus going from a meme to a expert in his field , Kudos
His makeup looks different
Damn he's SHAKING
What in the multiverse is this
Holy crap Linus is a certified star now, this is surreal to see right now, like an underground artist making it mainstream
bad bunny burned his only left neuron here
Everyone (rightfully so) talking bout how humble he is or the actual content of the video. Meanwhile I am here sitting like,,,,, whoa, he has an actual last name?!
Wait a minute. Linus didn't drop anything.
im surprised he didnt drop anything...
This was the first time I've seen Linus nervous
I think Linus might be on herbs or something, his energy is really high!! Also Linus is responsible for most of my learning to build a computer, so cheers bro!!
Yeah this was cringe
want to calm Linus down. let him explain tech
the best guest ive seen on this show
in the same chair the rizzler sat
If you been watching Linus you know he is not the one you want answering your questions.
jfc this was hilarious. The accidental cringe was perfect
You did great Linus
I think this should be a yearly thing ces + Linus
Linus looked liked he was gonna piss his pants.
That was an amazing segment!
why is he so damn fake on this vid...
Looking through Tonight Show’s recent uploads. Linus Sebastian’s clip has brought the most views in a single video upload in a while. Which is pretty wild. Media has completely changed since the pandemic. Stardom is not the same. Hollywood is definitely not the same. Culture has been turned upside down with mass/ instantaneous information sharing and social media. For better or worse. Youtubers and other platform influencers are now the new celebrities.
To the non-tech people, you came on and did magic.
Jimmy showed his age with that waifu comment 😅
Linus you did it man
Linus is like the tech magician
Congratulations Linus
They need to have him back on every year.
man I can feel the nervousness from here, can't imagine how I would fare if a pro is still prone to that
imagine how much linus got for the promotion from the brands to bring it on the the television
our boy killed wp linus
Pls
Jimmy fallon pls pls Kpop bts JHOPE
Pls pls
Jimmy fallon pls pls Koop bts j hope
hahaha he's so nervous.
Make this a regular segment
I am so disappointed that @linustechtips didn't say lttstore after mentioning the backpack. You have to go back.
Best Fallon segment yet!
could not believe my eyes linus was on a real tv show! omfg
I would have never imagined this collab
Linus is just as retarted as when the zoo guys are on the show
I was EXPECTING a segway for the new bagpack. Wtf. I'm indoctrinated?
Cool stuff. I'm impressed.
Heck yeah LTT. Make him reoccurring!
Linus made it to the Jimmy Fallon Show. I'm shocked!
He almost having a panic attack.
Linus on The Tonight Show was not on my bingo card for 2025! Gratz @LinusTechTips. Been a fan since 2013!
That was such an awesome clip!
Good job Linus!
Where's the LTT boxer and water bottle?
2:48 Linus: "THIS. THIS IS THE FUTURE"          Jimmy : 👁👄👁 great to see Linus on!
Linus has more talent in his pinky finger than both those goons combined.
The oddest combo of guys wtf Jimmy
Idk what's up with Linus and Gamer Nexus but this shows he is not affected at all.
Linus the tech " tip only" guy.
Should have brought some Honey!
The socks and sandals.. fashion crime
Looks like linus brought 10x the average youtube views for TTS with this clip.
Damn, Linus got like 5-10 sponsorships crammed in here.
This is the most cringiest interview I've ever seen in my life.  Linus completely humiliated himself.
amazing video! :D
ive been watching this guy for yeaaaars, he is a gem man
Nice 👍
Cringe
Now get bad Bunny on Linus lol
This man has literally went from working in an IT department to the Jimmy Fallen Show. Holy shit.
Wow I never knew Linus was a communist, hmmm learn something new everyday 🤔
This might be the moment that those glasses destiny changed. They may well have been one of the "dust bin of history" objects until the moment Bad Bunny said "oooh".
Remember that Linus and LTT lied to their fans for over a decade and made no changes till he was called out! Not a company you should be watching for reviews or entertainment.
Why felllon has invited this horrible person?
Suck it! Gamers Nexxus ! 🤣🤣
Linus didn't drop anything...Neat-o stuff too
This is what Linus means when he says that compared to traditional media, youtube is kinda a small fish. One could tell that he was a bit nervous, down to his smile at the beginning. But like he said in one WAN show, once he gets going, it's at full energy
I was waiting for the segue
LINUS IS THE GOATTTTTTTTT
Where is Linus from?
Truly impressive to watch Linus clearly nervous when he got there to then see him just get comfortable and find his rythem.
papa linus on the tonight show mc yes
I've never seen him so nervous and excited! Haha.  It was almost too giddy, but also knew the segment would be too short for him to say everything he wants to.  So....don't worry about it!
true
Sick
There is always a segue when theres Linus.. anyone catch the AMD segue? 😊
You know he went through a big scandal last year?  He's too commercial.
He bought the rights for the video brand from his boss for $1.00. At the time the boss might have gotten the better end of the deal. That’s a story.
More Linus, please. Turn it into a Steve Irwin-type segment.
The level of fraudulence, pretentious humility, & fake excitement Linus exudes here is not only offensive, but insults the intelligence of the viewers. What a clown.
2:57 Linus was shaking like a leaf on a tree putting that pen back
He got a REAL haircut.
Those glasses are something I would have bought in highschool 😂
A nerd in his natural state, giddy, excited to share the new toys.... you done us proud Linus!
Yeah, you won't be scrolling tiktok anymore on that thing..
linus normie tech tips
lol jimmy couldnt even pretend do care. anyone else get the feeling linus was being talked down to/patronized?
Linus has completed his sellout arc.
Seems like he's really overacting... Maybe to match for Jimmy's overacting... But just too much.
02:16 winking to his waifu robot girlfriend 🤖
I first saw Linus Tech tips unbox a pc case on a bench in a public park... Now he's at a major talk show.... Dayum
Man... old media just sucks.
I'm happy to see Linus give a little boost to network TV, I like Jimmy he deserves it.
Linus is such a tech nerd and keeps this stuff interesting for all of us.
LINUS ACCTUALLY MADE IT
First off the fact that linus to didn't mention ltt store once is sad lol I've never seen him so nervous. His hands were shaking the entire time lol happy for him though. Awesome opportunity
This would be a cool recurring segment every year after CES. Surely there's always 2-3 interesting new pieces of tech that the audience might like to see! @fallontonight @LinusTechTips
Note that this Video isn't available in many countries. So the 2M Views after just a few days don't even resemble the potential interest in Linus at Jimmy Fallon 🤩
Missed opportunity to pull a 3 screen laptop out of the bag...
Congrats Linus!!!
Loved seeing Linus on Jimmy Kimmel, thats awesome stuff. Been his fan since the early days.
I’ve been watching LTT for a decade……..you can tell they are mostly from Canada…very nice and their accent slips every now and again.
Congrats Linus! and all the team!
Sign of the apocalypse
The views! Smashing it. Get this guy on regular for all the tech
Idk about new thinkbooks or thinkpads but I feel like old thinkpads gonna increase in value
No Segway?!?
BRO LOCKED IN WHEN HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT TECH
This Is Pure Cringe
Hope he gets invited more often as a regular section on the show!
This segment is absolute crap. Most of the mainstream audience has no idea who Linus is or the level of business he has made. They barely go into his history and have no in depth conversation at all. This is a glorified Home Shopping Network segment where Linus just happens to be presenting. No wonder these late night shows suck these days.
This what happens when Hollywood in jail?
It's so strange seeing you showcase tech sitting down like that 😅 but this was cool to see! Congrats 🎉 you did great! 🥹

LTT being on Jimmy Fallon was not on my 2025 bingo card
Bro is living his dream. He's so nervous he'll cringe later but I hope he knows how happy his fans are for him. He broke a barrier, and legit should be proud.
You can tell he is super nervous. He should just be himself not trying to make an effort for people to get to like him. People like him anyway, Linus just be yourself.
Fallon trying to look like the cool guy here… not working
How much was this lad paid by the sponsors for promoting on Jimmy show lol 😂😂😂
Linus was coming off as nervous right until he took control of the show with, "Have you ever looked down and thought 'a few more inches would be nice.'"   That was when Jimmy Fallon lost control of his own show and got schooled by an OG YouTuber. Well done, Linus. Well done.
Dear Santa, all of it...
Linus is not at all nervous. Nope. Nu-uh. Don't know what you're talking about. Also, what's with that kempt hair? :D
what the hell
never in my life did i expect to see linus explain to jimmy kimmel what a waifu is but what hell here we are
what no segway
It's cute how nervous Linus is for the first minute
thats awesome he made it on here!!
He’s a man child
Wild that this is The Tonight Show's biggest video - including Taylor Swift - since Rosé a month ago.
Who was that latino sidekick? Didn't add any value to the show if you ask me... he was a dud
Omg Linus was so nervous! But he did great!! ❤️🥳🥳
Bad Bunny was the odd one here 💀💀💀 he look Reta.... dude still can't speak English
Look at all the stuff that backpack can fit, where can I get one? 😏
Mah brother did it!!!!
That waifu joke will become a cult classic moment on live tv
There is nothing cooler in the world than seeing one of us on a major media outlet
"Did you smuggle some stuff from CES" .... again??? (sorry call back to like 2014 if your a fan lol)
A lot of stuff go through with precise wording, tight schedule and not doing the presentation in his own production.. Well done Linus!
lol...Linus.... A man who doesn't exhale. ;-)
LINUS!!!
Congratulations to Linus.  A true milestone
Congratulations to Linus.  A true milestone
ngl this needs to be a montly segment man
Damn i just realized Linus wearing socks and sandals
LTT fan base coming out! Look at that view count!
Never seen Linus so hyper before
Linus was like a puppy that don't know how to behave. He was 1000% to energetic. If he would've just chill a bit, this would've been 10x better.
Great fun you were so excited i would be too
We started from the bottom now we're here
MSM trying to make nice with the YT world... i still don't trust em
Li nus did it!!!! LETS GO!!!!
Linus looks like he's hyped up on amphetamines :P
HOLLY F he nervious  . Love it.................JIMMY ............. U NeEd Linus on Weekly for tech tips ..Make it hapen chop chop
random ah collab 💀
2.1 Mill views just cause of linus.
this should be a recurrent segment for every relevant electronic show done throughout the year (CES is big, but there are some others)
azumanga confusing x gen
Yes Linus! When Jimmy looked up with the Steam Deck, Linus had the same reaction I did lol. We know dude, we know :D (The way he was gushing at 0:39 tho)  He was so eager to demonstrate the tech, it was like watching a magician at a birthday party. Smashed it bruva!
Okay, so you guys need to have Linus on a couple of times a year or so, Jack Hanna style. Except instead of bringing animals on to pee on the host, he brings tech on. Peeing on the host being optional...
oh fuck, his ego is already too big and this is just going to make it worse....
A fan 🎉 from the start
Great segment 👏
I've never seen Linus so nervous
the gimmick of showing off CES products was very strange, like i'm watching an AD, but i guess that's what TV is?
he actually killed it lmao
This was unexpected lol. Well congrats too you Linus!😎
Linus is a whiny scumbag...
He deserves a lot of credit for doing so well. This was not easy.
I'm sorry you hooked up for a collab with this guy, Jimmy. He is NOT a stand up guy. :(
Most popular clip since ROSE last month.
Linus is such a narcissist that steps on the little guy to get ahead and only cares about himself.  It's a shame he's getting this platform.
Wait does he seriously not know what Waifu is?  I know it was a stint he was pulling.    Wonder if he went home and google'd it..
When he said "Do I know Bad Bunny".  I'd be like "No, I know Big Buck Bunny though".
Linus wholesome af
Let's goooo!
You nailed that segment Linus. Congrats.
Damn… jimmy finally made it huh. Bros out here interviewing big names now like Linus
No idea who Bad Bunny is, I know LTT though 😂
of coarse he is wearing his sandels and socks
crazy how nervous linus was
now invite Steve from gamers nexus next
Eminem Tech edition
LETZ goo Linus :D
Linus with a perfect hair parting ... worth the watch for that alone!
No way LTT is now on a corporate talkshow. Linus the celebrity?!
I think I'm in the twilight zone
Bro's hair was on point for this interview. I don't think I've ever seen Linus' hair looking so good before. 11/10
This is how it feels to be the last person alive on your team. Too much adrenaline
Steve and jay 2 cents seething now how TF Linus got on jimmy fallon
Fun fact, Linus is by far the richest of the three
Goodbye E3, back to CES, Videogame products at CES, like those wonderful My Arcade Products.
Bad Bunny’s idea side of the brain just blew up when he saw the wearable screen hahahaha.,. He’ll come up with some creative 💩 with them. 😆
Linus is more famous than jimmy,
You deserve it Linus
That laptop is insane
I know he started out nervous, but when the tech started he gave off Steve Irwin vibes, just extremely passionate about everything. An amazing job, Linus!
Linus is so nervous right now. I can't remember the last time I've seen him this fast moving and talking, high pitched voice linus. He's so jittery, its crazy to see.
Love to Linus so damn happy! He should just leave Steve from Gamers Nexus alone and enjoy this high.
This is just an ad for some CES gimmicks, very sad.
This is real?! Damn!! Good shit Linus!
Respectfully speaking, I've been M.I.A from U'r content 4 a lil bit. But the combination of talent U finessed 2nite, was too unique to just scroll on by and not stop to see the why. "Mortimer, we're back... God bless America".  ☮
Don't forget about LTTStore
I’m mad I didn’t know he was on Fallon and I casually deleted this episode from my DVR.
lol wow Fallon has fallen off no offense to Linus but this is his guests now????  Linus is so nervous its cute tho
What a FAKE character Linus acted  out in this TRASH of a show!  Can't take him seriously no more! 🤔
Nice try, A.I.!
Finally on mainstream TV! Well done Linus and team!🎉
the steam deck glasses seem amazing for on the go gaming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owEKTfe1Gno
Kinda surprised Linus didn't plug his merch store rofl.
Linus is such a shithouse, poor reviews, mediocre comedy channel.
Linus did a great job. Also I need those gaming glasses ASAP.
Really Linus? Are U on Sugar-Rush or something...?!  #JK , 😀 congrats now your on another tube 😛
I really like the le last technology they showed but imagine if they could make it work wireless like using bluetooth, that would be the end game.
Yep, I’m one of those that grew up in parallel to LTT channel!
Jimmy Fallon, is kind of yesterday.. to old media to be relevant. (fake laugh doesn't help iter - both crowd and host.)
W LINUS 🙌
2:15 how did that not land XD
so this clown now has another clown with him because he couldn't keep up ? sad
That was so fun!!
That was FANTASTIC!  Linus you were so nervous, but adorable, and those finds you showed off were EPIC!! 🎉🎉🎉
Linus is too pumped up in this, cute bugger!
Hahahahah yess 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I was watching the WAN Show when Linus mention this.
I completely missed it the first time I watched it, but after listening to the WAN show I came back and watched Linus react to his own joke about being on “Real TV”. Hilarious. 😂😂😂
At least he's consistent if nothing else, LTT is nothing more than a sponsorship peddling sales channel so it makes sense to give off the sleazy salesman vibes
I don’t typically watch Linus anymore since Gamers Nexus showed us how evil Linus is, however even though I don’t like him I am happy that he got his big moment on tv.
Linus on Jimmy Fallon, never in a million years.. so proud and happy for you !!!
Linus being Linus.😊
Y’all really think Linus was actually nervous while doing this? Think about it, this is a persona that he HAD to have to come across to the normies. It had to fit the image of a tech nerd, if he was relaxed and not emphatic no one would be engaged by the conversation. He’s a stone cold killer, everything looks so calculated about the way he talks. Respect.
Linus is just a big kid
Damn that must have been hard for Linus, Serious TV is crazy stress
The excitement is astounding!
The fact that these guys don't know what a waifu is shows how out of touch they are, geez
wait, watching this after (in the middle of) the WAN Show segment about it is so cute. Linus talking about how all the reactions and interactions are completely genuine makes this so so lovely. just three bros broing out I love it
I have no idea what a Bad Bunny is.  But on the WAN Show, Linus described him as the most "effortlessly cool" person he's ever seen, and I have to agree.  Gott dayum.
Linus did us nerds proud! <3
0:12 😂😂😂 The oh shit the joke didn't land face  Bad joke aside, you did very well here linus.
This makes me so happy l, thankyou jimmy!!
Dude!!!
Bad Bunny had NO idea what was going on 😂
Damn, that laptop just had an erection live on tv
They messed up the projection part, they displayed just the game render and not the vr render perspective. Huuuuuuuuuuge missed opportunity for that company.
Great to see Linus on national TV!
Wait...bad bunny is a dude?
First time I've watched Jimmy Fallon. Linus killed it!
This was awesome. I've watched Linus in hundreds, probably thousands of videos but seeing him on TV is somehow different. He seemed nervous at the start but as soon as the tech came out he got into his stride.
“Evacuate the Los Angeles. Engage all junkies and get this man socks and sandals!”
Oh sh*t Linus going Hollywood
where is the segue?
It's so odd, but entertaining seeing Linus outside his own bubble :D Not to say, the bubble he has built is imopressive!
This is the only time I liked the tonight show
😅 Linus was so nervous 😅 Great show!
This guy is legendary !
Obviously only China can do that "Lenovo" 😂😂😂
wow i thought this is just AI stuff the new gadgets are crazy
You don't see @gamers nexus on real television
Yo he did it live!
Poor Linus so nervous but so good
This is awesome been watching you for years! Badass to see all your hard work pay off Linus
bless him.
Bring Linus back every year right after CES. Jimmy and his guest will always have a fantastic time.
I have heard of Linus but who the hell is Bad Bunny?
For anyone that doesn't normally watch or "know" linus, he's not normally so giddy and jumpy....  okay, maybe i take that back... a little... but, you know he seems almost childish at first in this bit,  but don't let that fool you. he's a serious businessman who employs over 100 people, has like 8 youtube channels with well over 20 million subscribers, millions of followers on IG and tiktok, and has been doing serious tech work, including reviews, networking, marketing, and video creation and editing for over 15 years. He's married with kids and his wife is also his business partner. He often says, "people think i'm the boss, but i have a boss, and it's Yvonne."  They've been married since 2011, which makes him a capable husband and father, to boot.
I wish he had the beard😂
Ive never seen linus more exsited 😂
Its funny, his DMS are filtered out and never even seen by him directly LMAO, even on discord U cannot message anyone from the DEP.
This should be an annual segment
Good to see you buddy. You Rock ✌
Man, it is surreal to see Linus on Tonight Show! Bro is bursting with excitement!
2:19 Linus forgets he’s talking to normies that don’t know what a waifu or husbando is 😂
Us waifu fans understood that line right away, thank you for being so cultured linus! Always loved your content!
All grows up
LINUS THE GOAT WOOOOO 🔥🙌💯
4:15 Bad Bunny keeping the key pressed down lmao too good
If they did more videos with people like Linus I'd actually watch this show.
I’m love Linus being on the show. Love him
WTH! No Segway... to our sponsor!? I'm so sad but entertained at the same time 😂❤
Best example of Canada and PR in the same room 😂
My favorite rapper and countryman bad buddy and my favorite YouTuber in one video… what the hell???
I find it hard to trust someone that wears double earrings on both ears and isn’t female 😂
Jimmy's audience isn't really on YouTube, but Linus' is, so it's funny how looking back at the recent view count on Jimmy's videos is like a range from 10-50k with spikes of a few hundred thousand, and then Linus' video has over 2M. Jimmy should do online interviews with other YouTubers, maybe as online exclusives. I think it would be funny to watch Jimmy's signature brand of Caesar Flickman "everything is awesome!" clash with creators who genuinely want to have a conversation about something they are truly passionate about.
dude said wifu on national tv
Would love to see more Linus on the show. He has been lighting the spark for decades now and really has a lot to give to your audiences. Plus I am sure he would be less nervous if you just let him focus on the tech.
He didn't disappoint.. here's to Linus Gentlemen!
The word OG .. is for linus

3:49 Please tell me he did this in purpose! HAHAHAHA!!
Very cool linus watching you first in that little blue shirt playing with a childs fire engine all those years ago now all the way to The Tonite Show. WTG!
i cant believe this. im so happy for this dude. one of my favorite youtubers and got me into tech also! especially building my own pc.
I'm smiling like a proud parent looking at Linus in a show like this.
He's always this excited.  Good to see Linus on Jimmy's show.
Funny how honored Linis is to be here when he has a way bigger reach than Fallon nowadays
Man, that was Linus in chipmunk mode. He'd right though - once it got onto tech, he was at his best. His enthusiasm is charming.
I can't believe he didn't mention LTT store once lol
the waifu "Dont worry about it" and fallon's reaction had me rolling. buggest laugh ive had in weeks.
such a cute segment
Such a surreal feeling watching a dude I grew up with, someone I feel like I know and is a good personal friend, achieve such great levels of success, it's genuinely inspiring. Lots of success stories tend to be people with connections who would have been successful anyway, selling us a story about how hard they worked, when in reality it was a small loan of a million dollars.   Linus genuinely is a regular guy who worked at a computer store and managed to capitalize on every opportunity he was given and actually built himself to this level of success, like, I watched it happen, I was there with bro for more than a decade, such a crazy feeling. It makes me feel like I'll be able to achieve similar levels of success for myself someday if I genuinely work hard for it.
On the tonight show; your a real celebrity now...
That is so cool, I've been watching Linus for a very long time, I don't even remember when I started, and to see him on actual TV is incredible
w
CES and Linus - Thanks Jimmy.
wtf linus? and bad bunny? This is really werid for me... hes like my favorite dude... and bad bunny is my wifes favorite dude hahahah que lo que papi buenito
Make it a once a month segment!!
Ya Made it, putz
Epyc.
Linus is a friggin  know nothing moron!
Great job Linus!
This is brutal... he tells a joke and no one laughs, and then 2 seconds later you hear distant female laughs mocking him. Must make him feel back in high school again.
I have never in a million years think that Linus would be on a late night talk show.  Congrats to him.  He has come a really long way.
Bro, was that Waifu bit scripted? Absolute gold Linus. Love that I got to see Linus on The Tonight Show
success well deserved.
What even was the point of this segment?
They cut too much on air.. but im glad they posted it all
It's so crazy (and amazingly cool) to me that this nerd I've been watching for 15 years is on TV showing off tech!  Also funny that jimmy has had to bring on a side host who is way funnier and cool than he is. The way he tries to parrot what bunny says n does anytime he gets a laugh from the audience is so cringe n sad. Give it up bro
jesus linus breathe
Great job Linus, this is a leaping moment for tech everywhere.
Despicable man.
Se le salió el español a Bad Bunny de las ansias xDDDD Déjame vel, déjame vel
Jesus Christ, this is embarrassing. This show has fallen so far that they have literally the most controversial and objectively worst tech tuber. Just pathetic.
Nice one Linus! You didn't drop anything, not even a plug :D
This is huge for all Level-1 techs and nerds around the world!
Linus was a bit too excited to be there.
Deja vel deja vel!!
wow this is cringe.
That's not the real Linus, he didn't drop anything.
Wow! Linus was so geeked out! Very cool!
Linus is a sleezebag.
Should have asked Jimmy what video game he was playing when Nicole Kidman came over to try and date him.
Who are you and what have you done to Linus
Damn Linus... you KILLED it brother! You effing killed it! Well done! EVERYBODY is going to know who you are now. I hope you're ready for what comes next!
Bro what.
I love linus what a pioneer of this industry ❤
Jimmy seemed pleased. Will Linus be asked back? Hmmmmm
Ease off the coke bro, Jesus!
I have a soft spot for shaky guys in a stage. Linus did great
He's turned into such a tool. He's been showing off all his money over doing anything worth while for the past 5 years. Used to be a fan, but he's all about showing off shit no one actually needs or can afford. That or his multi-million dollar mansion.
What is wrong with Linus? He's well hyper. Did he have a line before he went in?
the first 1 min is painful, but then it's normal Linus.
linus is easily the more famous of the three,  who are these other two? never heard of them.
whaaaaatttttttttt
I somehow think Linus's waifu wont be so impressed. :D
This has to be AI
This was awesome can't believe I'm just hearing about it 3 days later
Been watching since 2011, when he was on ncix. Learned lots about pc parts and how to build my first PC in 2013 by watching his videos. I have built like 8 pcs since then, sold some have most and I’ve repaired quite a few laptops and phones. Really cool to see him on this show, loved the laptop joke. But legit that tech is sick, I have a 14 inch laptop and would love it to do that.
I'm not sure Linus realized the joke in the "few more inches would be nice" 😂😂😂
this is the most nervous I've ever seen this man.
Linus on drugs
This man went on national television in the US an said "Waifu" to 60 somethings in Omaha for the first time.
Amazing job, Linus!  Great work.  You did all of us nerds proud!!!
Wait, what the F*** is linus doing there?!?!
I kept waiting to hear "and now, a segway to YOUR sponsor" or at least an LTT store plug lol
I didn't know you were on this crap
wait this is real
I don’t watch your show, I don’t know what BadBunny is, but I like Linus lol
Where's the shameless plug to lttstore backpack?😂
Linus is the GOAT!
nice job to invite LTT
Best Get Ever
Awesome segment indeed! Great job Linus congrats!!
Woot Linus, Glad to see you on the Tonight Show, Great segment, Bring him back!
Who knew Linus would be this excited to be on a has been show
Could be the first of many such appearances.
LINUS WAS ON THE TONIGHT SHOW???????
Way to go Linus!
Who are these people Linus is interviewing?
I cant wait for the wan show to here how beyond anxious he was
LTT on the tonight show!! So happy to be here for this.
This Is Nice Show From Linus and Bad Bunny Excelent 🎉😎💪💪💪, Super exito pa conocer a el Linus 💯 Daleee
I'm here for Linus
Linus in the end trying so hard to  shake Bad Bunny’s hand 😂.
This linus character needs to cut down on his coffee consumption. Another Canadian that embarrasses me just as much as trudeau does.
"Bad" Bad Bunny! lol
Why would tech illiterate moron like Linus be on the tonight show???  This is pathetic.
Man these are some really cool tech products, especially those wearable glasses.
"How do they do that?" "Don't worry about it" --Typical answer to keep people in the dark.
I love that BB pocketed the glasses!
Linus S. Let's GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At first I thought this was Ai. LMAO! Go Linus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope Linus can become a regular on Fallon, like the animal trainers that bring exotic animals onto the set, except he brings exotic tech!
We love Linus from India ❤❤❤🥹😭
The smartest guy🤔🤔😅 and dumb a****$$ as hell no talent 😣😣😣to your right side. Period😎😎😎😁📢📢🤔
Holy Shit Linus is la-jit now.
Bro linus, did you get your other glasses from Badbunny 😅😎
A decade of hard work in the yt mines only to become a glorified CES advertisement billboard. I would of hoped for Linus to have been able to share his story to a mainstream audience, creating a business empire out of wacky tech videos. Alas, I did not expect this segment from our sponsor…
Awesome Jimmy, thanks for having Linus on.
Love it!!!!!❤❤❤
Wtf
The Tech Tips man met the Social Man! He also advertised commercial merchandise
Never in my life did I think I would see Jimmy and Linus on the same screen. Great job and congrats Linus!
como se devaluó el programa con bad bunny ahi dios mio
Linus was clearly a bit nervous but we've all been there (school presentations, work presentations, public speaking engagements etc.). Happy for him and hope he's not beating himself up too much for sounding nervous. He came across as genuine and enthusiastic about tech.
Little Linus growing up right in front of our eyes. Not physically growing but metaphorically
Little Linus growing up right in front of our eyes. Not physically growing but metaphorically
Well done Linus, you were great
Reppin the sandals, my man
How much speed did Linus take before this interview? 😂😂
Ive followed Linus from the begining.. what a cool guy, absolutely love his content!
Let's so, Linus!!! Absolutely killed it by being himself!
well, I guess you killed it and are now the resident tech nerd for the Tonight Show. Congrats man! We are all proud of you
Linus having to explain what a waifu is on national television is 100% not what i expected from this clip lol
Fallon 10000000% already knew what a waifu was lol
We should have a few minutes every few episodes to get some new hot technologies avalable for all (not only prototypes) presented by Linus just like you did there. I didn't even notice the 8mn of the video and feel I could keep watching this for more and more minutes.
He's rightly nervous, one thing is to be with an audience and camera and production crew live on tv, and another thing is to be in your daily home/office filming and editing your videos the way you would normally do. But this boy crushed it, he was so seamless, interesting to watch and go with the flow with Jimmy and Bad Bunny,he's a truly entertainer at heart also!  I saw Linus videos since he's started back in the day, and he's a reference in IT world and gadgets, I'm glad he gets the recognition he deserves!!
Bad Bunny at 6:56 is like me with my cousins while they are playing on their console. And me waiting for my turn. 🤣
The nervousness just confirms that Linus is a genuine person with emotion and not another lizard dead face beast youtuber. It was actually funny and Linus did great!
Thank god he didnt go on Jmmie kimmels clown show! He probably would have been voted out of canada !
Linus is worse than trump.
The fuck is bad bunny doing there.  Send him back to Garbage Island.
Linus! The man, the myth, the legend!
Loved this, please have him on more 😁
i was really expecting Linus to be right back after a word for his sponsor 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s awesome congrats u got to be on the show and meet jimmy Fallon and thanks for the awesome vids and work u put into them and the amazing team u have my of my fav tech channels learned so much and enjoy it as well keep up the good work
LTTSTORE! Linus and his staff are freakin awesome and it was cool to see them on the show! glhf fam and I want some of those glasses.
on tv... In socks and sandles
Linus is fangirling so hard!!!
Bad bunny straight up pocketed thoes color changing glasses lol
@ 2:48 this is the future lol
I wish Linus had brought a Fake Laugh Detector with a mode to STOP that fake laugh by force if necessary 🤐🤐
How good is Linus!!
love this they neeed to bring him back lol
The community showed up for this one…too bad they didn’t segue to their sponsor.
Damn... xreal one pro... $600.
Holy crap I could feel his chest tightening at the beginning
Very nice showing, Linus. Your journey from your early videos to now is inspiring.
My favourite on real tv. AND on a proper night show. Yey!!!
I never imagined he would be guest on the Jimmy falon show at all!?
Wake up from the matrix, Jesus Christ is the light, the way, and the truth.
GamerNexus watching this video FUMING at Linus' success 😂😂
lmao it was hilariou when Linus told Jimmy to look up.
Wow you went from the BIG TIME to   t.v….
wtf was he on??
4:53 whaaww!! ✨
Linus trying to explain waifus. Or rather, trying to not explain them. 🤣
Linus Was a little hyper in the show Or excited Overdrive
Crazy to think that Linus with sock with sandals was the sexiest person on that stage, including Bad Bunny.
Ureal Linus 🎉😊
Linus is on coke 24/7 you cannot convince me otherwise. He did a great job on here tho 😁😁
Watching this at 0.75x speed made Linus sound normal.
linus has tech fever. cool products. esipecially i loved the vr glassess so practical
LTT ASSEMBLE~
Linus didn't drop anything? wonder how many takes this took
Never seen linus this tense, this happens if an inteview has no script, Now he's a sale's agent.
Please bring Linus on after every CES! Honestly he should be The Tonight Show's Tech Rep/ Presentor.
This is surreal 😂
Love this for LTT
He didmt memtion the display glasses brand
It's almost surreal seeing Linus on national TV. I've been watching him for YEARS on YouTube. He is one reason i got into tech, mainly PCs and phones.
Great job Linus!
The views don't lie, we love Linus 🫶
That's my little boy 😅, so proud!
This guy's pretty good I watch this techie dude
Really happy to see Linus there.  Yeah lots of nervous energy.  But he was awesome as always.
Yooo Bad Bunny can be hilarious 🤣 😂
That laptop is a garbage product, but it shows the capability of the oled screen.
This is a crossover I never imagined I'd see. congrats Linus!
what's bad bunny even doing there lol
3:35 linus, don't drop it
Was great seeing Linus here! He was super nervous but he got it! Looking forward seeing him coming back to the show!
Never have I ever thought in a million years would I ever see linus sebastian explaining what a waifu is to jimmy fallon.
Jimmy, once you’re successful, you’ll have your own backpack
Either links was very nervous or he had way too much caffeine. Love you linus
Wait until he learns about the sacred numbers 😏😏😏
Why Linus hair looking like something is wrong ?
I watched this live on TV and they really cut this down. Glad to see the full version here
"I like people that don't follow the rules" What a lie ! If it was true he wouldn't hate Trump so much.
Seeing people who aren't in the tech space absolutely geek out over these products was so fun. Thanks, Linus, for bringing tech tips to the people.
Congratulations Linus.  He was so nervous but did great.  Still had some classic Linus lines.
Linus as a host > Jimmy
Bro
Linus farted at 1:52
jimmy fallon reacting to dope technology is the most authentic jimmy fallon ive seen in decades
What the fck is Bad Bunny doing there?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I watch more linus than jimmy.....
So proud of you.
Wait the important question who taller jimmy or Linus
Bad bunny investing in them sunglasses
This should 100% be a regular segment. Monthly? Once a quarter?
What a gem of a man
Linus pissed his pants🤣need more practice in the talking to non tech ppl i guessed😅
Pretty cool linus
That’s nothing. Just wait..
Well deserved. Don’t tune in often but I will for LTT!
Serioussssly!!! That was a great show
Dude was beyond nervous lol
cocandy is a hell of a drug
I have always been a huge fan of Linus and LTT, but he is now officially my hero!! Shows up to his first big network TV appearance wearing his socks and sandals like he does all day everyday, this man is truly himself no matter where he goes. Keep it up Linus! You da man buddy!
Congrats LTT and Linus. I stopped watching you after Gamers Nexus spilled the beans on how screwed up LTT actually is, but respect. Great job!
When Jimmy was talking about backpack, I was just waiting for Linux to say "LTT Store Backpack" :D
my boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We Got Linus On The Tonight Show Before GTA6
Aww our boy has hit the bigtime.
Linus on Jimmy Fallon's show?!?! 😂😂
I hope they bring them back for more tech stuff. this was a great segment. Also seeing Linus nervous  Is so funny to me knowing how great he is usually in front of the camera.
Truly heartwarming to grow up watching this man and to finally see him on REAL TV lol! Performed amzingly as expected. Legend
I was obsessed with LTT years ago to the point where it gave me the confidence to build myself a PC just to prove I could do it. I only used it to play the 2001 Harry Potter game and then gifted it to someones nephew that wanted to get into gaming
The best thing about this interview is the wink when he's talking about "interactive Wife-foo robots". LOL!
As long as linus doesn't get biten by the woke bug with those 2.. you have Diddy's favorite ride right there (bad bunny), trying to act like a man, and trying to be funny about computer nerds, yet he can't sing without autotune..😅
I love how incredibly nervous he is, but as soon as they ask him something about tech he somehow changes.
we love linus
3:54 “a few more inches would be nice” had me in the stitches 😂
Awesome, Good for you Linus Well Deserved you have earned this time to shine. So happy for you.
That was amazing!!
Not sure who Bad Bunny is, but I recognize the screwdriver guy!  ;-D
dayyumm i want all that stuff he stole from CES
Linus calm down! Jimmy Fallon is such a goofball!
Those were the NCIX days, right?
Love that Linus got to be himself on a major broadcast and bring his tech spunk
Oop, your Canada is showing Linus
What a crossover this is for me personally: I watched everything Linus did (and dropped) for many years (ever since the early NCIX era), and I became fluent in English thanks to him. Interestingly, I became *less* fluent in Spanish thanks to my namesake Bad Bunny (nah just kidding it's a common attack among people that don't like his music but I love his songs).
Wan show this week is gonna be great. 8 minutes of linus is not nearly enough.
Linus was so wound up he looked like a did a line before going on
So did he return the sunglasses to Linus 😂
Linus was funnier than Jimmy 😂😂
Once that Tech came out, Linus was right at home.
Well done Linus, you smashed it!!!!!! 👊👊👊👊👊
Linus doing segue in live tv
I think this is AI yall
What kind of weird universe are we living in
Super humble. Linus is the best
6:20 😂😂😂
Was that a LTT backpack??
Very proud of Linus making it to a different medium. This must have been huge for him.
So proud of Linus and the team. Congrats!
Cute. Linus doesn't know, he has 10 times the viewers of Fallon
I chuckled with Linus winking with the waifu thing, heheheheh, probably a means to dissipate his being nervous.  Understandable, but a huge achievement for him!
Great video! Thanks YouTube algorithm for suggesting this!
what makes linus so successful isnt his knowledge. its his enthusiasm and charisma in front of the camera. he really has that steve irwin style
It was nice to see him warm up after a few minutes. He did a really good job
That promo for the ltt store backpack 😂😂😂
he is such a cool guy
linus HAS ARRIVED!
Greetings from Finland to LTT.
This is definitely the most views Fallon has had in some time.
Legend has it Bad Bunny still has the glasses in his pocket.
please have him back!
Waifu is Japanese for wife, known also as girlfriend.
I cheered and clapped in my house. By myself XD I love you all!!! LMG for LIIIIFFFEEE
who the fuck is bad bunny? lol
Linus having more Energy than  Jimmy he could remplace him anytime
I absolutely love LTT, Linus, and the entire team. Linus has got to be one of the best human beings to be looked up to by the public, today.
no LTT store plug. How do I know where to buy my tools that i don't need XD
Engineer: Turning a Blind Eye to Evildoers Is Being Complicit Engineer Peter Johnston said, “I hope these organ traffickers can realize what they are doing. This is a terrible thing. People should have a conscience, be kind and be sober.” He said he hopes the Australian government will stand up against this organ trafficking. He remarked that those in power will be accomplices if they turn a blind eye to the evildoers.  Will Dobbs, who works in the government, said, “Organ transplantation is a scientific advance for humanity and it should be voluntary. But I understand that in some countries, organs are taken from people who do not consent and these people may be killed for this. I think this is a terrible thing. As Australians we have freedom of speech and should do everything we can to support those who do not have the right in other countries to protest.”  Dobbs added that the Australian government must take a clear position on platforms such as the United Nations and in external dialogues that we oppose organ trafficking. Australians who go overseas for organ transplants must know the source of their organs and provide transparency.
Last glasses look great
holy shit, this dude made it to the big screens, nice! Way to go Linus!
thanks for letting me know i should unsub Linus, thought you had moral integrity then you go on this radicals show hah
WOW......
LETS GOOO LINUSSSS
I don't think this was the real Linus, he didn't drop even one thing.
Well that was something I wasn't expecting! Yay Linus!
What, no segue to the sponsor?
5:38 My heart's beating, my hand's are shaking, but I'm STILL SHOOTING, and I'm STILL GETTING HEADSHOTS
I thought his name was Linus TechTips, not seabasschin
Linus killed it. So cool to see him on the tonight show, almost feels unreal
This guy is a genius
Haha wow!
weirdest collab
Congrats Linus!  You've made it!  What's next?
the guy worth 15 millions subs and you only gave him 8 minutes? 😂
Who is bad bunny? actually never heard that name before.  I'm guessing not the same circles as Linus.
Oh no.... Before the election, this would have been excusable. Why the heck did LTT think doing such an about-face on their values would be a good idea? What the heck. I really wish this hadn't been in my algorithm.
why crapbunny?....
ALL HAIL LINUS.
Linus is on tv, 😮, which timline is this,
He made it to real TV -- LOL  love it!  Linus is goign to save this clip for ever!
U can tell how nervous linus was. Great job thought.
wtf is a bad bunny.
Nice one! So cool to see Linus on the show!
Linus cranked up to 300%
oh wow how much did Lenovo paid for this advert. pretty good
I love my Linus, and even though he is all hoarse from CES techtalkin his brains out, he takes time for some of the less popular shows.   ❤  canucks on yankee tv!   Weird!!!!
We got Linus from LinusTechTips on real TV before GTA 6!!! 🤭
Holy shit, I never thought I would see Linus of the freaking TONIGHT SHOW!!
Congrats LTT
how much are they paying him to promote non english artists this is crazy
why are we having Bad Bunny do non english performances on mainstream american english TV? oh yeah, Trump's coming in office they want to diversify us
most viewed video going back for a whole month and it's been up three days, hell yea
those glasses are 100% making an appearance in a bad bunny music video lol
Looking good with combed hair Linus
7:37: Diablo kbron Bad Bunny lips
Linus should have smoked a fatty before the show. He was nervous as hell.
Is this what adderall does?
Prob not really Linus.....he didn't drop or nearly drop any of the tech LOL
absolutely cringe
Wtf
Really over exited. But I like you.
Very cool Linus was on actual TV. Just too bad it was on Fallon.
I’d never think I’d see the day I’d see Linus on Jimmy Fallon
Hopefully next , Jimmy could bring MKBHD.
next is Asmongold
Waius and dick jokes. Gotta love Linus.
Linus sandals are high tech too😂
been watching linus for about 9 years now,  so proud to see where he is now.
So Linus gets nervous too!
Linus clone is almost identical
This needs to be a regular segment
I don’t watch this show but why is bad bunny there 😂
Watched Linus early on and he just took it all over! Great for him and his teams up there and those were some finds ...Xreals Soon!
Holy cow, I have NEVER seen Linus that geniunely flustered
No one shills like Linus
is this real and not AI????
YouTubers should host tonight show host more often.
He did a few Line(us) before turning up
It's really impressive how technology keeps evolving so fast. Playing with a handheld and having the screen displayed on glasses so you don't have to look down constantly? That's genius.
Those sandals and socks haha
Linus on tv! Oh man, congrats sir.
Linus is an awful person and shouldn't be given a platform.
TBH I didn’t know what waifu meant. Now I know. Stay desperate boys 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Crazy seeing linus on TV!
Linus was one excited little boyo
Wow! I never thought all of my multiverse interests would collapse in such an unexpected way.
What? Sebastian what are you doing there with bad bunny? and where is the segue to our sponsor?
This video gonna blow up :D Leggo linus, he should get a tech show on cable
Gotta be honest never would have imagined this.  Been watching LTT since 5th grade when I wanted to build my first pc, the guy and team is an absolute legend.  They for sure deserve this type of recognition! HUGE CONGRATS!
I been watching his videos for years
I bet Luke dared him to get that many dick jokes in there. 🤣🤣
I was expecting Linus to hold up the backpack and push the LTT Store when he went to get stuff.
that bunny dude stole the glasses.
This is so weird to see Linus nervous. It actually is making me unsettled.  He is always so confident.
Ain’t no way bro said Waifu on national TV
Digging the crossover! I have been using AIOs since they came out and I have Linus to thank for coming up with the best fan mount radiator orientation.
We got Linus Tech Tips show and tell with Jimmy Fallon before GTA6 bro…
Have to give Linus credit for still being Linus even on live TV.
hell yeah my man Linus finally on a TV show
Hahah this was not in my bingo.
I love it!! GO LINUS !!!
Tbf bro stilll has no idea whats he doing 20years later
I missed the segway... 😀
Linus on jimmy Fallon was not on my bingo card for 2025 but here we are 😂
Anyone saw bad bunny stole the glasses..haha...
why is Linus so nervous? lmao xD
Linus sex tips
Linus on a Jimmy Fallon Show? That's cool, I've never thought that will ever happen.
This was like watching oil trying to mix with water....
Great job Linus! This should be a reoccurring thing
My boy... *tears up* he's all grown up now *sniff*
I’m glad regular people get to learn about him. His reach has now surpassed the middle shelf
How funny to see him so nervous, so out of character, but he did a great job.
Here i am waiting for a segue to the sponsers.
Great job Linus.
he so amped, that it looks like he on drugs here. I know he ain't, but still.
Pervert`s and pedos ....
Nervous Linus
Just enough to sell out to CHINA, Linus LOVES VACHINA
Congrats Linus, you again managed all of it in the end. Love You Bro!
I loved this. So cool to see Linus thrre
Look at you, man!!  How cool!!  You looked nervous AF.  lol
Look at you, man!!  How cool!!  You looked nervous AF.  lol
LTT hoodie and backpack LOL, awesome to see Linus on mainstream media
finally my childhood geek is in the building
the hair isn't messy enough
Nothing like bringing a lying, conman scammer onto your show to further reduce what little credibility you had left...
People gonna be looking like Stevie wonder playing driving games with those glasses
When Linus gets nervous his Canadian comes out😂
Check out the views for Linus compared to the other videos… awesome job everyone!
Linus and Jimmy, fantastic couple😂
LFGGG Linus, was hoping you'd slide in a Segue to the sponsor
I need linus there more often
watched Linus for a decade, crazy seeing him on The Tonight Show!
He must be sooo nervous :D
Linus on this show reminds me of those animal tamers that bring in animals. Only he brings in the tech. So he is the "Tech Tamer"
the tech goat
We love Linus!
I need to try that gaming sunglasses
Make it a reoccurring segment.
Ive learned so much from his channel. I hope him the best.
He was clearly nervous, but he still ended up doing a great job!
He's the Alex Jones of tech
Nice job Linus!!
What a crossover episode. 7.5/10.
The WORST tech youtuber. Garbage
was planning to get Xreal really soon. tnx for this video, this seald my deal.
What is @LinusTechTips doing on Jimmy Fallon? Must be Doctor Strange and The Multiverse of Madness Directors' Cut or something.
I'm here for Linus
Couldn’t have been Linus, he never dropped anything, lol.  Iykyk
@LinusTechTips this gives me hope that if I just hang in there, that'll be me in 20 years :)    Seeing you up there is amazing, great job!
Linus acting like an full fledge tech nerd :😀
Ohh Man he is really nervous
Today I learned that bad bunny is a dude
Linus and Bad Bunny in a video feels like a hyper targeted ad … I’m very concerned 😅
Man I don't think I've ever seen Linus so nervous (obviously I only see him on camera but still)
hahahahah he totally stole those shades
I want that last glasses.
Fallon is Legacy dying media, Linus is selling out and giving us all the finger for going on this boomer show.  What a shame, not even Mr. beast who is BIGGER then fallon would do this.
Happy for you buddy @Linus
@linustechtips amazing job and great presentation! No segue to the sponsor? No lttstore plug?  So happy you've made it this far! Great guest choice @JimmyFallon!
Linus seemed nervous at first - but looked like he recovered quickly as soon as you start talking about tech.
If you would tell me Linus would be a jimmy Fallon years ago I would of told you you’re crazy
GN to Conan lmao
Tick tock and Instagram Side by syde Man. You can brain rot yourself twice faster now 😂
Never in a million years would I anticipated a LTT - Bad Bunny crossover
16m subs and about 1m videos and still got nervous. So dont be hard on yourself when u become nervous sometimes
This is great :D
Who are these 2 guys? They're pretty cringe are they neurotypicals or something? Oof
Linus is going to upgrade NBC's whole setup... Disclaimer, something may blow up..
we got linus tech tips on jimmy fallon before gta 6
Linus found the Tonight Show's staff cocaine stash and devoured it
This is the coolest thing ever
Linus Tech Tips -to- Linus Tech Pops
Linus was great, jimmy could have done better
So Nervous hahaaaa
He forgot to tell how he sells people's equipment without their approval, tests it with faulty and rages then to get exposed for 10000 faulty tests
How humble, he didn't even mention he brought the merch in his own Linus tech tips backpack that he has for sale.  My son has that backpack and it's awesome.  I especially like the bright orange interior.  It's so easy to see stuff at the bottom, nothing gets lost in there.
Linus 🔥💘💘💘
To have seen Linus go from his NCIX YouTube channel days to The Tonight Show is completely surreal! Love our BC boy! So glad Jimmy got to meet him!😂 LTT is gonna be fun this week, looking forward to the WAN show!
I love this
Ha those sandels are just... WRONG!!!
LTT
Too bad you can't like anything twice on YouTube
We need more of these types of segments where we all learn something to keep your show alive.
So hyped <3
1.8 million views in TWO DAYS!
My Man
Bud Bunny? thought that was a beer
I was there for hist first video. This makes me so happy.
I love the slight laughter from the audience about Linus bringing a backpack, some of them know.
Im not even american and i know he mispoke the saying about vegas
Well i did not see that one coming😄😆
this is mainstream media pulling viewers from youtube.
You can tell Linus feels out of his element here, even though he's spent years in front of a camera. The giddiness was palpable as soon as he started talking, lol.
Love linus
Linus is a natural. GJ 🎉
No shameless plug⁉️
This is completely incredible!!! Linus on Real TV!!!!!!!
Came here for linus. Not sure why people still watch these tonight shows. They have not been good since jay leno. Just cringe.
Great job Linus
Linus has done it. Yohoo. Tonight show!!! What is next Linus? President of Canada? And he didn't drop anything. How impressive is that
He's so nervous, oh my god. I'm blown away and it warms my heart to see him be an actual person instead of a boss or an internet personality 🥺🫂
Nice work, Linus! Very cool to see you on a real television!
Well done Linus! Hell ya!
Wow, nervous as frig. He wasn't kidding on the WAN show when he said being in front of a live audience was different. Dude looks like he drank 15 cups of coffee and a couple hits of speed.
Linus with makeup
Is this sped up? Because this sounds nervous as heck
@LinusTechTips Bro, without attempting to be toxic and just stating facts (I pay more attention to these things than I think you do), don't hold Fallon up on a pedestal.  You're a FAR better human than he ever was or will be and you do FAR more for humanity again than he ever did or ever will do.  Also, TV is SO outdated.  Your platform is the future and HIS platform is the distant past.  He should be begging you to be on your show ...  just saying
omg linus is the best haha but wth bro sandals lol a tru tech nerd.
Where did he get that back pack at?
no segue? bummer
A bit hyper😂
Lol its so weird to see linus so nervous
God i dislike Jimmy Fallon but I love linus
Linus was really nervous but as soon as he started talking tech, he was right at home.
Sometimes you forget that YouTube creators are regular people, and get nervous/excited in front of other celebrities.
Congratulation to Linus
The tech community is gonna make this the most viewed video on the Tonight Show's channel
Someone needs to keep Linus away from the coffee.
expecting a vlog from Linus on being a guest!....Nice one Linus!
Now get Billet Labs and Madison Reeve on
Ask him about the "hard r" 😂🤣
LINUS IS NOAH TOO IM MANOA
Linus is The Tech Guru of our era. Before any setup or tech purchase, I always check his reviews and unboxing videos. Thank you, Jimmy, for having this segment. I have never been able to attend CES, so I always rely on people like Linus to share the experience.
Bruh this is a crazy cross-over episode
This is how you know Jimmy has finally made it. Linus came on his show. HUGE.
Linus just have the Peter Parker vibes, ngl 😂
Esta super mega ultra N E R V I O S O el LINUS :v
Love Linus, this is the only Jimmy Fallon segment I'd watch if it weren't for his kpop segments.
He most wholesome shit I’ve seen in a long time. Well done Linus 👏🏽
Linus did great!
What a combination Linus and Bad Bunny! Brain and Brainless!
boys always be boys
Linus on Fallon with Bad Bunny? wtf is 2025???
“What’s stores in LTT HQ, should stay in LTT HQ”. How we am glad that LTT employees does not follow this rule😅
A live filming audience likely through Linus off at the start, but he settled in. Anyhow, hopefully this will become an annual bit after CES.
I don't know who this Jimmy fellow is but I like to see Linus in new environment
Zero times he said sorry to GamersNexus's Steve. And here we are, Linus continue to pursue the expand of the brand and keeping to inflate his own ego after everything that happened. Zero sorry to Steve. Zero gratitude. The fall will be big.
Not the educating on what a waifu is to the traditional TV crowd hahahah
Linus is preparing us for aliens like Alex jones said
This is the first time I'm getting to see him this flustered and it's wholesome to watch.
Linus should have a regular spot on the show - he nailed it!
SOMEONE’S JEALOUS 👀 ahHHGN 😂😂😂
Linus is nervous. I can tell because I read the comments.
Very cool to see this.
lunis bump
I think it would be really cool if Linus became the Tonight Show's regular tech correspondent.  What the audience didn't know is Linus wasn't invited until the last day of CES, but he and his team were able to reach out to brands so that Linus could demonstrate their tech on the Tonight Show.  I think the products they picked were really cool, and I wonder what tech he could get his hands on if he was invited back before next year's CES.  Linus was clearly a little nervous, but he was still really funny.  A longer interview with Linus might also be cool, though probably not on a late-night show, but maybe a Dateline segment.  Linus basically started doing unboxing videos, and he turned that channel into a company (or really several companies) with over a hundred employees.
Linus needs to have a segment on the Tonight Show as a permanent fixture.
I didn’t know Linus had a last name. I thought is last name was tech tips.
I thought his last name was Tec Tips
Most humble and deserving individual Linus you are a legend!
Genuinely curious if Bad Bunny walked away with those shades still in his coat pocket lol.  Also Linus killed it!
now this is what the show needs more often!
Lol as a latin fan of LTT it’s so weird to see Linus in the same place as Bad bunny😅
Jimmy could've had other youtubers who are just as entertaining as Linus and they don't mislead people into buying the wrong stuff with wrong data or indirectly squash any support for small creators who were affected by the honey scam. But no the world needs to see Linus and he's the only guy who can showcase his personality with tech, wow what a great guy.
Who was that random dude next to Jimmy?
Linus forgot to take his chill pill
Love this!
Linus, socks & sandals 😂
long time fan of Linus, its funny to see him nervous for probably the first time... great job Linus!
linus finger tips!
When bad bunny heard waifu he knew what it meant
“Yo quiero yo quiero” lmao I laughed so hard 😂
Could have put on shoes once in a lifetime 😂😂😂
2:47 Jimmy Fallon is dumbfounded by 💥The Future💥 (2025 colourised)
wholesome
Shit, that's the guy I watch on YouTube all grown up!
First time I have bothered to watch the show since Carson's final show.. real shame this was edited into almost nothing
It’s official, Jimmy needs an LTT segment each show.
He settled into it for a great segment
So awesome to see Linus get the exposure he deserves for all the years of incredible hard work.  Super happy for him and everyone at LTT.
Need more Linus!!!
I've never seen Linus this nervous lol
Linus sex tips
I thought Linus was acting, but actually He's so nervous.. wow..
And thus, Linus begins his new life as the quirky guy who brings weird electronics onto all of the morning and night talk shows.  (Which used to have quirky guys who bring weird animals on.)
I don't think pairing him with bad bunny was the best idea ngl
You deserve this man! You work extremely hard and have for a while. You’re one of my favorite Youtubers to watch!
nice to see Linus supporting smaller creators x2
good job linus
missed the part where i have to skip the segue from the sponsor ngl
Don't worry about it
i thougth the thumbnail was teaking lol that's lit
Best guest ever. Humble beginnings, well deserved.
Benito bouncing up and down saying "yo quiero yo quiero" 🥹
Obviously fake, he didn't drop anything.
Linus was so nervous 😂😂
Pretty cool to see Linus on here. Im not always a fan, but he has been putting in that work to get to this moment. He looked nervous and his voice sounded shakey, but he got through. He couldn’t resist subtly showcasing his merch though.
Wow. Linus giving exposure to smaller content creators is amazing! Hope the bunny guy gave Linus the glasses back
Wow. Linus cranked the Linus-ness up to eleven.
Linus will outlive any “Tonight show”… P.S. Why bring linus, unless you need to reach the younger generation which doesn’t watch TV anymore and those SUBS are going to pass away in 20 to 30 years and no one will even know who Jimmy is, let alone the Tonight Show, but everyone will know who “skibidi” is and “Linus”.
Wtf linus and bad bunny together In a single video😅
The first one or two minutes were pretty cringe but then he got there!  Good job Linus!
Did bad bunny end up keeping those glasses 😂😂??
lol when nerd and late night collide
Xreal is one of my favorite tech products and company
The man literally went from shooting videos in his kitchen to being on a top TV show. A testament to vision and commitment. Well done! And fun segment! 🙂
He’s done made it wow
This was a crossover I didn't know I wanted. BB x LTT hahaha
Kool I was one of his first followers what a journey . Good Job man
Se tumbo las gafas!  LOL
Seeing Linus here is crazy to me. He was so damn nervous tho but he did great once he started talking about tech!
linus is a genuine legend
Linus didn't drink his chamomile tea. He looks so cute being out of his comfort zone.
Was waiting for: this is an amazing segment,;,;,; to our sponsor! 😭
The views on this versus the average views on other vids on the channel.
LTT BAG
Hopefully we can see more of Linus in the future!
Wow, congrats, Linus. This is a huge achievement!
Here from Linus’s channel! Never watched jimmy Fallon before but watching you wear those glasses was hilarious
Is it weird that even though i dont watch/consume legacy media anymore, i still feel proud seeing Linus here?
fake
Bad Bunny x LTT crossover
he shaking
gay ass show
Way to go Linus! 🎉🎉🎉
Don't care for Jimmy, but you can tell Linus is just super excited to be acknowledged by popular media. I never seen him this excited.
Linus Sebastian? I thought his last name was tech tips
Linus is so JACKED! Jezz what did they give to him for breakfast 😂😂😂 Some white powder on his eggs this morning?!
Make a yearly segment with Linus Media Group showing off CES Please!
So happy to see all the hard work linus has done pay off I've watching him since his ncix days.
Linus Dons his 18 YO voice again ;-)
I can tell a professional did Linus’ hair before the show. KEEP THE LOOK LINUS!
Awwww nervous Linus is adorable
It's cool how like I understands that he's only on there for a limited amount of time but he got to show off a lot of cool Tech at the same time
Am I missing the part when he sold out to Samsung and Asus?
It's unofficial Linus is going to build a PC for bad bunny
SCIENCE !
Daddy Linus has come
Jimmy Fallon asking about waifus.. LMAO dates him pretty bad
Here for Linus.
Linus is wearing socks and sandals on live television!!
He test products for their durability.
Let him fix something. 🙂
Jimmy must have given Linus some snow HOLY
god this is so cringe
Loved it!! Super entertaining 👏 😄
Crazy how this video has the most views of the recent videos
Linus really went there in socks and sandals
Here to show my support for Linus. He deserves this.
Curiousity got the better of me. After the whole debacle of Linus auctioning off that heatsink that belonged to a company that he summarily destroyed in a review and possibly ended their future Ive avoided anything Linus. Wish i would have stuck with my gut instincts because I already hate Fallon. Cringe on a whole different level. Reminded me of a bill Hicks skit. Suck Satan's C***
Dude I do not think you could have been any more excited for a second I thought you were gonna start having a full on seizure.
Linus deserves this so much!!!
It’s funny seeing Linus so giddy over this because his channels bring in way more views than any late night show lol but I get it, there is something about being on a TV show that must be really cool
Not sure if Jimmy realized how embarrassed Linus would be for being made to explain "waifu" live to millions of normies, but it was the best part. Genuinely LOL'd. Wish I could see the LMG team roasting Linus for that one.
Jimmy really never heard of waifu before?
Cant believe this is real, watch every one of LTT's videos and wan podcasts thought this was ai at first.. crazy
Haha soo happy for Linus
Explaining cyberbog women was so perfect for a talkshow good call 😅😂 you completely understood the remit and fed the jokes 😮 absolute natural!
first time seeing linus getting so nervous, and he has make up on.
Linus is bigger than Jimmy but more nervous.
I only see this is because bad bunny
Where is it? Where is the segue to our sponsor?
Up next.... this segue to the sponsors.... This line would have been GOLDEN!!
I can totally understand, him being a nerd like me, super excited and a little freaked out going on The Tonight Show and meeting Jimmy Kimmel! :D  I am so proud of him!
And you thought his head was big before...the man made it to Fallon!  NICE.  As a somewhat "older fella" I have had the pleasure of watching a lot of youtubers and content creators come up...and I have been watching Linus since the beginning...this is great fella!  good on you!
It's crazy that these Chinese companies make most of their products thanks to the US.
I never watch this channel/show, but had to check this one out because of Linus.
As a Latino I know everything about Linus but know nothing about Bad Bunny, and the same reason why I watched the video, Linus is a legend!
1 day, almost 2mn 😂
LINUS IS ON THE TONIGHT SHOW?! WHAT?!
The audience can't see that they are seeing through those glasses. Odd choice
who the f is bad bunny and who cares
Never seen Linus so nervous
How could you not love the guy! He shook them nerves off pretty quick lol
Socks and sandles on National TV. I love that guy!
Too adorable @linustechtips
Where is the segua, to our sponsor?
Wow... natural high or upped the Ritalin before the show LOL... Seriously... Wow, this is so awesome to see Linus on "real" TV lol.. And what a show to debut on.  Congrats dude
Linus killed it!
You made us needs Pepsi today Linus… we finally felt a bit cool lol. 🤓
He's so nervous. I've never seen Linus nervous.
I'm a flight attendant and I brought the Rokid glasses been using them for a year. I attached it to my phone to watch movies and TV shows it's got micro OLED screens and I connect my steam deck and Nintendo Switch to it. It's awesome! Not new tech. But super cool.
He was at ces I would of totally got a ticket. As lv local I always wanted to go an if he was here make it worth it no matter the show
wtf Linus AND Bad bunny ??? what is happening right now
LTT FTW!!! Real Sigma Chads are Tech Alphas!
Now thats what we would like to watch
Fallon saying "waifu" is wild.
It is absolutely awesome to see Linus on here wow
LTT on the Tonight Show!  We made it baby!!!
Now they started inviting pathetic youtubers 😂
Linus is a real boy now
Can’t believe I live in a timeline where Linus was on Jimmy Fallon 😂
So he just came on to show some tech and thats it? Boring...
Linus on steroid...:)
Not the crossover I expected. Great stuff, would make a great recurring segment!
Something to offset the bad juju of 2025. ❤
I don't know who tf the Mexican guy is but it makes me very happy Linus is on Jimmy Fallon.. He literally is going big time!
What no segway lol😊
I never thought I'd see Linus on the Tonight Show with Fallon... He made it! For sure it's nerve-wracking in front of a live audience/celebrity vs YouTube videos. Those tech stuff were cool to show off! For sure it's expensive....
Cool to see Linus so nervous/excited, good for him
It's Linus!  ...........but who are the other two
Linus killed it!
Wow Linus starstruck it's great 😂keep being awesome!
Congrats Linus! You’re a bit nervous bro, otherwise a fun segment to watch! You deserve this recognition.
We got Linus showing tech tips to Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny before GTA 6
Ok cool Fallon eventually warmed up to our boy
Linus' last name is tech tips not Sebastian silly
this was super neat
Is this AI
How did the costco guys end up on here before linus lol
Linus you are very smart and funny
Linus killed it!! good job buddy 👍
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.  I was worried about the shaky beginning but Linus had a bag of tricks to knock it out of the park.
Why is Jimmy sitting next to someone? Not weird!
This needs to be a regular segment on the show.
Awesome Job Linus! You're real famous now!
Linus should be a regular tech feature!
This pure gold! Seeing one of my favorite YouTubers and one of my favorite artists in one video is so awesome!
Hes acting so different here. Relax good sir.
He’s going to watch this back and realise how bad of a decision this really was
Linus is so genuine!
I want all 3 of those products pls. Great segment Jimmy!!!!
The Sandals... keeping it real.
Nice! Linus only looked moderately nervous. It was a great presentation! Seriously want a pair of those AR glasses. Text Neck be gone.
Can't believe he didn't throw in a LTT Store ad. Didn't talk about the backpack.. screwdriver.. nothing! What are you doing Linus?!
Bad bunny looked really good in those white glasses with the red shades
LTT brought a spike in viewership.
Such a cool video! Linus & Bad Bunny... Never in a million years did I think I would see both in the same video! Amazing!
I could almost feel the adrenaline coursing through Linus' veins
3:49 that was insane 🔥🤣🤣🤣
4:09 that was great scripted comedy. Just the right amount of on the nose
1:29  dam linus that was an awesome answer. because its real. its what you guys did to me. you planted that seed of knowledge and intrest. thank you 💖💖
I really wanted him to walk in with the LTT theme playing
Linus and his waifu made a surprise appearance, everyone put your keyboards together and get ready to press alt+F4
Anyone can get nervous and it's fine
Wow he finally shaved!!
Holy shit Linus on The Tonight Show?! Absolutely not expecting that!
FINALLY! getting some big screen time, been a Linus tech tips fan since I was a lil kid xD
never in my life i would spect this collab
That some1 who masked linus did a horrible job
This was hilarious lol. The way they were genuinely baffled as to wtf these new devices are and their reactions 🤣
wow did not expect to finally enjoy a Fallon clip, Linus you made it bro that's awesome
8:22 class act waiting patiently to make sure he shakes hands.
Never would expect Linus in here ngl lol
Just got back from CES myself, and I love his take that most of it is gonna end up in the dust bin of history, but right there, at the show, that's the one moment that you'll ever see it before someone determines it may never make it to production.  very cool.
Happy for you Linus, love the makeup 🤣but seriously it's great to see you engage with the less tech savvy and put on a show
so they paid 9mil$ to bad bunny to be on show ? hah
LTT's just hit the upper echelon, boys. And we were here to see it all.
Can't believe you mentioned Waifu 😂  Great interview!
The One Pros are going to be pricey. I want one. LOL
Greatest show ever.
As if Jimmy didn't know what a waifu is
He’s clearly faking being excited
LINUS WOOOO YEAH CANADA YAY TECH BRO YEEEEE
Love u: Linus
Get a fucking stylist if you want to be taken seriously. Your outfit on TV is an embarrassment.
Linus you’re wearing socks and sandals on TV? WTF.
For fucks sake. BUY A STYLIST. Your dad pants are a total disgrace. 🤦‍♂️
Love how he’s manages to get an ltt backpack promotion into this lol
Linus is more happy than a gay man at a sausage fest
Was going to hunt down the segment through other means, so glad it was uploaded here. So much nervous energy worked massively for this bit. So glad it went so well and hope linus see's this as a win in wanshow this saturday (in the uk so thats when wan is available). You definitely achieved what you were planning last wanshow. Congrats. On to bigger and more mainstream things!
im just here to read the comments
Lets go Linus!! Thats awesome
I'm not crying, you're crying.
He was bit nervous, but after little bit that went away, its a big deal, its different to talks in front of camera, and in front of full room of people used to different talk, not simple to switch that button, good work Linus, good tech  i was surprised by this because television became less and less about real world stuff, i hope there is more of this.
Of all the people in the world to explain what a way waifu is to Jimmy, I did not expect it to be Linus, but I’m also not surprised it was Linus.
@LinusTechTIps we love Linus and the team there!
Jimmy Fallon is such a lowkey hater
I feel like someone I know made it on real TV 😂 this is cool. Congratulations Linus. And judging by the engagement this has vs many other videos, the show knew exactly what they were doing bringing you on :) significantly more views and comments than multiple videos from the past few weeks.
Yes!!!!
His last name is not tech tips? O_O
I just watched Linus tech tips for the first time the other day and he’s on late night that’s amazing ❤
For once Linus didn't drop something. 😂
Nice work Linus!!! I didn't know we could bring stuff home from CES!? I'm bringing my own backpack next time.
Love u Linus gj
glasses lol
Im so happy for Linus. What a great demo of these products!
He kind of look like a puppet getting controlled by strings, look at that arm movement!
WAIFU ROBOT 😲
Linus, you brought something to showcase that the audience can't experience.  WTF?
We got Linus from LTT on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6.
Thought this was a fever dream...
The socks and sandals… CLASSIC Linus!  Wow this is so cool to see him on the big time stage 🔥
Notice how the audience is completely lost and silent and only reacts when encouraged to.... like 90% of them dont know what is going on, because theres not a Hollywood celebrity in the guest chair for once, but rather an internet nerd
the mirrored display just showing the screen of the game normally is killing me 😭
Linus has given me tips in my career. I am now a technologist 👨‍💻
Been watching Linus for years, been listening to Bad Bunny since before Diles. Never once did I think there would be a chance they would cross paths 😂
OMG - that was super awesome - Linus just has this aura about him - he is like someone who is always experiencing something for the first time - and wants to share that experience of wonder with the world. THIS WAS SUPER COOL
Omg.. he was sooooo so nervous! But he did a great job :)
2:18  ye “ interact” with
Nice decision to Bring more people from different fields other than actors and musicians of famous athletes.
He's what so many streamers are trying to be. Mainstream.
Live audience is different than talking to your cameras.
This is amazing, seeing Linus with Jimmy is like a dream. Congrats!
I wish they would have actually aired the full interview but I understand they have to cut stuff for time
Linus you finally made it! Actually Jimmy you finally made it!
How the heck is LTT making it to Fallon now?!
Linus> these clowns
It really is crazy that Linus was a retail employee, his boss told him to make videos (not in his job description) and now here we are. While NCIX is long gone
did bad bunny give the shades back? lol
Its like two different worlds meet.
Nice to see some LGBTQ youtuber representation on mainstream media.
Funny I didn't knew that guy was bad bunny, just as the bad bunny fans didn't knew who was this awkward "kid" talking about laptops or why his relevant
We got Linus on tonight show before GTA 6.
Killed it Linus. Well done!
Somehow he transformed in to  McFly's dad from the 50s
Congrats, Linus!
Why so nervous Linus?
I only watched this on youtube, what is real tv? lol
this is unreal... no. seriously. Linus looks like he is part of the green screen or running a different resolution than normal. I get that they have a budget to consider, but holy hell does this belong somewhere before 460p era.  xreal is interesting though.
Two most unlikable hosts in one room how did they do it 😂
Linus is well on his way to being a global personality - household name - he already has the merch
I understand that people have different interests, but how can people be so oblivious about this tech? I mean, they were more exited when Bad Bunny wore the glasses than for the whole tech display.
THIS is what late night TV is all about.  hopefully after inauguration the producers will wake up, we want more like this, and stay out of politics!
WAIFU 😶
Really happy for LTT well deserved! thank you for the years of tips Linus and team.
2025 highlight: Linus teaches Jimmy Fallon what a waifu is
This is insane. It’s like an MCU crossover or something. This how you know these shows are trying to prove they’re still in touch.
He is so nervous hahaha, does he realise he has more viewers than Jimmy globally? Jimmy should be nervous 😀
I got dizzy just by watching Linus here 🤣🫨
Is this real or fake?
Nice, Congratulations Sebastian!
That was precious 🥰
love linus tech tips!!!!
Need this segment every week
Great Job, Linus!!
That's great! It's exciting to see Linus on such a popular show!
Linux should stop drinking red bull
I love this Linus has NO COOL on his most boring day. But this? EPIC! Zero Calm. 100% Authentic.
This is so wholesome, Linus is the goat.
might be the most random collab ever
WHAT IS LINUS DOING ON THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JIMMY FREAKING FALLON WHAT THE HECK????!????!? WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN
Do I smell a Reoccurring Tech Segment for Linus on Late Night???? ......Go Linus!!!!
So happy for Linus and the team!! This is so exciting and adorable! Congratulations!! 🥳
This is great!!! I am so excited for him. How cool would it be if he was like a regular staple on this show?? Like tech reviews with Linus or something
Here for Linus. I have no idea who Bad Bunny is.
Funnily I only knew this happened because Linus shared it. Great segment guys and congrats to LTT really, huge day for nerds.
He absolutley picked the right product to bring and show from CES 2025. AR glasses are going to absolutley take over the entire tech world here in 2025 and 2026. Full-size, regular monitors and TVs will be entirely wiped out by this new generation of glasses. Companies like Sony, Samsung, TCL, Hisense, LG and Panasonic all have advanced AR glasses in the works now. They will all be showing off several prototypes of before the end of this year. You will likely see companies like Rokid and Xreal get snapped up and purchased by the larger players in the display market. The future of all displays is going to be in AR glasses. And they are going to completely change the way we do our entertainment and computing.
Never thought I´d see Linus, in the tonight show, a few feet away from bad bunny lMFAOOO
Lol Linus is nervous when he's already famous. I'm only watching Jimmy fallon because it's Linus.
wowwww well done broooo...#epic
This is the first and last Jimmy Fallon video I will watch.  I came here for Linus.
Apple, hire Linus for your keynotes/announcements because he’s the best presenter in tech since Steve Jobs.
Looks like someone acting Linus😂
i cant be the real linus he didnt drop anything ....."great job everyone seeing linus nervous was insane its been awhile since i have seen him like that."
Bad bunny stealing those glasses is kinda like how linus stole that prototype water cooler then auctioned it off.....
Bad Bunny has blown up lately due to his recent change in which is a homage to his native Puerto Rican culture.  Linus appears to be doing the same with nerd culture.
Wow, never seen Linus so nervous. That's awesome!
Hell yeah Linus!
Why Fallon looking like he don't wanna be there? 😂
Linus is truly GOATED
LTT segment casually pushing 3X+ views over all other clips from this episode, including Bad Bunny's music performance, says it all ;)  <3
So awesome for linus!
How wholesome honestly
Did you see the pocket by bad bunny
I'd never expect two of my hero's from different universes collide like this
What?
VOTE FOR HAVING A SEGMENT IN FALLON FOR LINUS TECH SHOWCASE!!
Seeing him be so passionate after about 1:45 is so inspiring cause he isn’t going off script and if he is… its very well hidden.
Linus sounds like Shaggy from Scooby Do
Holy Linus is nervous.
THEY PUT LINUS IN MAKEUP IM DYING
Finally!!!
super charismatic professional entertainers left speechless by twitchy nerd's cool gadets
Ive seen it all
Nice to see Linus supporting smaller creators out there.
Very very rehearsed but still cool to see tbh
who the fuck is the other guy?
El chico necesitaba un poco de pitorro para que se relajara. 😂
Linus brother, I've been watching you for years and I must say it's pretty damn cool to see you on this show. You made it big my man. Hard work has definitely paid off for you in spades. We need to have a way to download your brain data when the day comes for you to slide on into the afterlife. 😂😂 Congrats man, hat tip to you! 👍💯
Quite a switch up to see Linus as the nervous agitated guest vs his usual calm host persona.
Lmao Linus is so nervous, but it was great!
I love you man
This is one of them type of guest that can go either way.  Linus killed this. He had the audience with him and that can be a massive ask.
Heeey for Linus!
linus and bad bunny before gta 6 is crazy
There is something about linus these days that just turns me off, I cannot watch his content anymore. Good luck to him and his team in the future.
Brought to you by our sponsor LTT. Even if he was Nervous Linus did great.
congrats! could see the moment almost getting to you like it should with any human being with a soul!  stoked to see on jimmy man came a lonnnng way, eyh!
Finally, a Jimmy episode worth watching
This made my heart warm ❤
Lenovo getting free advertising LOL
ma boi made it
Loved this.  Nice job Linus team!!
Be funny if the laptop grows when you're watching porn.
Linus teaching Jimmy what a waifu is is an all-timer 😂🤣
I'm one of the few old enough to have been watching Linus from the beginning. I've never seen him so nervous!!!  My diaphragm is exhausted just watch this.
lets go Linus
I reaaly thought that he was going to say, "Right after this segue" or  make an add for his backpack
Cringe...
Jimmy isnt drunk here
Whoa. Didn't see this coming.
This still feels unreal
I just realised how good the microphone linus uses in his videos and how good of an audio post processing the LMG editors do compared to this channel.
sounds like saul goodman
I felt like Linus was gonna lose his socks and sandals! 😂  He was so nervous!
I love Linus
Linus excitement being there is genuine, I don’t know but I didn’t even know I would enjoy watching a segment on this show until this 😅. Thanks for making me laugh!
Where is the segue to the sponsor
Literally who wouldnt be nervous? He kept his composure and this was the first time ive watched jimmy in months. Great stuff linus
It is funny how Linus is so happy to be on a shit show that gets less viewers than him and is not even as funny as linus tech tips and it is not even suppose to be funny....Jimmy Fallon is a hack and his show blows
Benito's awkwardness is so relatable and endearing lol
Remember to breathe, Linus 😂
Wait, Linus Tech Tips is on Youtube now?  /s
Best guest they've had in a long time
blimey
Jimmy seems so low energy, fake, and uninterested . He needs to be replaced.
Bad Bunny putting on the display glasses saying "Diablo Cabron!" is the epitome of being Puerto Rican.  Translation: "Damn motherfucker!" Which is a highly positive reaction.
Bad Bunny pocketing the sunglasses made me smile
Hyperactive Youtubers look so out of place on regular tv lol
@LinusTechTips, the Steve Irwin of Tech...
Bro wtf its linus on jimmy fallon🤣
I'm sorry what
Excellent demo. Linus was one of the first to legitimize YouTube creators as alternative TV media.
Alto crossover cabron
Wohooo Linus
I can feel how nervous he was
Kept waiting for Linus to "Do the Thing"  and segway into a Sponsor !  lol  He did awesome !  Glasses look Sick too !
More Sebastian on the tonight show please!!!
Used to watch Linus on ZDNet a long time ago on Screensavers
lol I thought bad bunny was the cash me outside girl.
This is the best crossover I have ever seen
wait. what?  omg.  YYYYEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Awesome job
Having Linus be the Steve Irwin of tech was a very good idea by the Fallon team or whoever thought of it
Linus made it!
Linus makes the big screen NICE!!! cool Tech too!😛👌
Most untrustworthy person in tech if you ask me.
Seems like Linus Sebastian, a Canadian isn’t worried about being annexed by USA as he’d used to a typical USA byproduct: “cult of stuff”.
I feel like Linus is out here representing all of us regular people. Love you Linus!
Jimmy birng him back for every CES!!
So fake
Im so glad he found some texh everone could enjoy
We're so proud of you Linus!!! Way to go!!! You dominated the conversation and made it your own. Great Job!!!
I would love to know how those companies, Fallon, and LMG worked together to make this segment happen
Fallon is the most annoying of all the late night talk show hosts.
Make this a recurring segment.
who is bad bunny
2:26 lmao at Linus trying to explain waifu 😂
Yay! 🎉Congrats Linus!
It just struck me: Linus is the "Richard Simmons" of computer technology. 😂
jimmy fallon was lying about not knowing what a waifu is, he is definitely trying to cover *it* up
Unexpected crossover
Awesome episode. Happy to Linus with Bad Bun on tv.
Insanity
Linus, you met Bad Bunny...  Im sorry that you had to go through that..  Im very sorry !
When I saw the pic I thought it was fake! 🤣 so happy for Linus. You’re the man LTT!!!
We did it boys
What's about the sponsor segment 🤔?
TRASH LTT TOXIC WORK PLACE
LET'S GO 🎉 boys, we make it, lol. Youtube is the network television now 🎉🎉.
I must be old.  Had to look up "Bad Bunny".  Funny to see Linus so nervous until he found his lane.
Jimmy is so drunk. Pitorro is Puerto Rican moonshine haha
hell yes brought along some AR glasses.  my experience in showing off my Viture Pro XRs is the casual people love the tech.  It's always a *wow* when they put it on lol
He's bringing in gadgets like a mad scientist in an action movie
in 10+ years i've never seen linus nervous before
fallon is a tool!!!
2:49 The moment Fallon realized he fucked up by having linus on the show
So cool Linus on big boy TV, shades of Bill Nye the Science Guy. "I see you have a backpack" missed the opportunity for an LTTT Store plug, was waiting for a segue to our sponsor
Screw Linus, screw Jimmy and screw the YT algorithm for pushing this garbage into my feed.
I think Linus regular tech segment would be great on the TTS - he brings cool things they don't understand to the masses.
didnt expect to see him here lol
Wtf is linus tech tips doing on jimmy fallon 😂😂😂
Been watching Linus since the NCIX days, probably like a lot of his audience. Way to go, fellow Canadian 😎 It's a very well-deserved moment!
This is awesome! Makes me feel represented. Go Linus!!
a Linus and Bad Bunny collab was not on my 2025 bingo card.
Did not have Linus on a late night show on my wild card for 2025!
The wall is breaking
What the fuck is on tv right now
Best guest you have ever had!
Based Linus.
love to se jimmy fallon and bad bunny support small ytbers. I knew your chance would come eventually linus!
😂😂
What a great guy damn
Love Linus, but damn, he so nervous x
I'm starting to like Jimmy Fallon now.
I gotta snag those glasses for my steam deck
This moment in History will be marked as the rise of the Nerds!
I hate everything bad Bunny to the bone  yet I saw the entire video because I've never seen Linus this excited and nervous about something. Great video!
Linus looks nervous as shit. Lol.
Nervous Linus! It's been like, a decade!
Didn’t even talk about the ryzen 4070
And he didn't drop a single thing. A+.
And he didn't drop a single thing. A+.
I was so geeking out watching this
: )
Fallon is officially alternative media
i did not see this comming tbh. and apparently neither did linus
I love that some producer thought "this nerd isn't going to be engaging, we'd better get Bad Bunny out there." The correct decision for the wrong reason.
Absolutely crushed it Linus! Hopefully they bring you back in, definitely have the energy to match Jimmy!
Linus had long hair, quite a few ages ago!😅🎉
what alternate reality have I just stepped into
Only thing that's made me watch Jimmy Fallon in years
Pog Linus
LTT still exists?   I quit watching his stuff a long time ago
Linus has some good Canadian puns.
Man, I really do not get that show...such boomer vibes 😂
I was afraid he will literally die in the beginning....but hey, he made it 😅
I never ever expected to see Linus and Bad Bunny in the same room.
This is so surreal 💀
Surprised he managed not to plug his backpack
strongly dislike this guy. he did a demo at Intel and i was working security there. was tasked with escorting him across campus. we got in the freight elevator and hes talking like hes a king and were all intel engineers, the brightest in the industry (back then this was accurate lol) and i just started farting in the elevator. wasnt even trying to hide it just rippin ass. loved that day. he never came back and is a joke.
Holy crap, I've been watching him since he was that scrawny little kid, now he's on the Tonight show, did he buy it or something? 😂 Let's go!
🎉
Where Segue? 😐
Never thought I would these three together lol. Congrats Linus!
Linus totally killed it. AAA+++++
who tf is 'bad bunny'
Linus is like the reptile guy of tech
This is AI ? ... and why is bad bunny there ?
I didn’t know he was gay.
My boiii Linus is on the tonight show!!!!
Holy fucking cringe. Dude Fallon sucks ass and you're acting like a fangirl 🤢 sellout!
Didn't Linus get cancelled?
so it was a "segue to our sponsor" :)  I want those Chamelo sunglasses
Whohoooo Linus and Bad Bunny Great!!!
Linus did good on this one. A real entertainer. This could have bombed so hard.
I have never seen linus so scared in my life
No way.. like all good tech stories you came a long way from the house. IYKYK
Late night shows often have people showing cool things, like for example an animal wrangler showing cute and cool animals. I hope Linus becomes the tech wrangler, showing weird and cool gadgets to a mainstream audience.
Is Linus on speed?
I never expected to see LINUS on TTN.
This is amazing! I thought his insta post was fake at first 😂
i know that he was excited but linus sounds hella flustered
Amazing to see that even while your a small creator like Jimmy Fallon or Bad Bunny you can still make an apperance on Linus Sebastian's talk show
Seeing Linus, Jimmy and BB together is so surreal
Seein linus from the days of sapphire7770 graphics card to now and still being super into tech stuff is amazing
Nervous Linus is wild
Good stuff Linus!
I have watched LTT for a few years now, and to be honest, it’s mind-blowing to me to see him on TV with Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny!
Linus looks like he had tons of coffee and then got nervous about the talk show before coming to the talk show. While bunny and jimmy look like they were high a little while ago but it has started to mellow out now.
That was great!!! 🎉
He should've updated their tech setup!
Linus finally made it
Wow!!! What a surprise to see him in the big leagues!! Congrats LS!!
CALM THE F DOWN LINUS
Watching regular people use new tech never stops being funny.
crazy how nervous he was there
congrats linus
I thought this was fake at first.... What a collab....
Linus is a piece of shit! He literally has you all fooled that he's a decent human being. He stole all the ideas from other creators and companies and made it look like it was his idea!! He's been doing this for years, and not one person has the balls to stand up to him?? He. Steals. Other. People's. Work!!!!!!!!!!!
1.5M views in one day 😁🤙  Yay LTT! I’m so happy!  Very happy to see Linus wore his usual sandals with socks to this. 😁😁 Great little intentional choices for the viewers who know.
Ooh linus is a chunky boy!
NO WAAAY ! hahahah! That is just awesome!
its so crazy seeing a local man on that show
Linus forget to mention that he also advertises scams
When Linus announced this I was so sorry it is not Kimmel or Colbert, Fallon is just a very bad and sad jike...
Never seen Linus this nervous. He sounds completely different from his videos.
Linus killed the demo
Good job Linus, making Canada proud.
Linus really has his finger on the pulse of Canadian fashion.
I used to eatch this MF when he made videos inside a literal closet. Now he's a guest in a late night show.
Talk about an overload of awesomeness, 3 of arguably my favorite people from across 3 different industries all coming together in one video. This was made just for me🥲
Linus should be a recurrings guest!!!!
We need Linus as a regular to show off the latest tech!!
Good lord Linus...take a chill pill.  Really uncomfortable seeing him blow his load like this...damn that sharpie was a solid 5Ghz!!  If someone doesn't GIF that I am going to be massively disappointed.
I love how Linus was so excited. Best for you bro.
hes so nervous, the last time he was like this was decades ago
It’s hilarious seeing line as this nervous
Bad Bunny really liked those glasses lol
WTF! You have time for the tonight show, but, couldn't inform us of the Honey scam? I'm disappointed!  🤣🤣🤣
Shaggy is that you?
Never seen Linus that shaky before it was Great!!
For Linus to pop out on in front of another massive audience and show some of the craziest tech the world has seen is crazy
never thought i would see these three together wtf
they put make up on him, and made him a geek. Man, Linus has a bigger audience and view numbers than Jimmy.
Linus us a lot more energetic than on his channel. He's far from lethargic though on his channel. Big pleasant surprise to see him on network TV!
LTT lets go!!!!!
Imagine being nervous on a show that literally nobody watches after all the years of grifting and lying about trump.
WTAF!!!???  Linus is on Fallen?????? Canada represent! #gangsigns Linus must be on Cloud 9 and beyond.  Rare to see a tech guy and YouTuber on a public talk show.  Sure, he's big in the Tech Community, but this is next level exposure for him.  Now EVERYONE (ala Gary Oldman) has see him 😮  Well, those who what late night TV 😜  Congratz to Linus!!   To the Tonight Show:  How did you guys hear about Linus?? Curious
Congratulations Linus!
Who (or what) Is that "Bunny" guy?
I never seen Linus this nervous before and it's funny to see him putting back the pen and he's hand shaking 😂😂😂 2:50
Wow. Linus has made it, lol.
WORST LINUS VIDEO
"... Sitting there you're getting some work done, and looked down and thought 'a few more inches would be nice'?" Lmao i'm dead💀
linus after CES is like me when i get new tech
Wow see the view count could one of the most watched the tonight show in youtube.
He was hyper ventilating
This brings me back to the joy of Steve Irwin bringing interesting animals onto late shows. Just now it's Linus bringing interesting tech. This needs to be a recurring segment.
Watch LTT often enough the past 10 years.   Linus is definitely even more hyper than he usually is (and this guy's a hyper type of guy).   lolol  Cool to see him on main stream TV.     Now to Linus; calm down.  Your voice is even more mousier than it's usually is.  lol  Keep up the great work, Linus.   :)
Where is "One thing I didn't like about Jimmy", Linus? :D
You've made these 2 dudes famous buddy, who are they Linus? ❤️✌️
LTT going big time!
Lmao whos gonna he nterview next,the guy from the Verge that didnt knew how to build a pc????🤣😅😂
Linus is so excited! I'm surprised they were able to keep him in his chair.
What is this bad bunny thing?
This dude is a weasel.
I feel like I just saw my big brother make his TV debut omg. Congrats, Linus!!! So proud of you and the team.
Gamernexus mad asf
Jimmy: "this is an amazing segment" to our sponsor
I love how much makeup they had to slather on Linus to try make him not look like the ghost that haunts the studio 😂
And he didn't drop anything!
We got Bad Bunny and Linus together before GTA VI
Didn’t drop anything, 2-stars
This is wild. I thought this was fake at first. Super cool to see someone I’ve watched for years on REAL tv lmao
“Thank you for being here, Noah” who’s Noah?
I still can't believe this is real
😂😂😂
Did Linus sniffed anything before show as he looks thirsty and talks agitated?!
Jimmy Fallon pretending to not know what a Waifu is, show us how you can't trust people.
My two favorite universes are colliding 😮
Just don't Like Linus.  He's proven himself to be a bit of a dick and not a super great person.
The circle is complete, Linus has finally sold out!
I'm not sure i like this jimmy Fallon guy. Seems a little weird
Those glasses are pretty neat , I wonder how much they cost.
I started following LTT over ten years ago. Great to see Linus and the team still growing! So helpful in the tech world.
Did someone offer Linus a pill to calm his nerves and instead give him speed....lol, calm down bud!
Top 10 anime cross overs!
wildest crossover ever
Mind blowing to me that he has made it this far!
Funny how taken out of comfort zone Linus is so nervous and bordering on cringe😅.  It happens to other youtubers as well. Rmember guy who shreds the guitar in his videos like there is no tomorrow, once he had to play with real band..totally failed and  folded.
BRING HIM BACK EVERY YEAR!
I thought his last name was TechTips?
Remember the trump convenction after that bad bunny became mad bunny
I literally never watch this show or any show on TV. I had to come to see Linus though he's the goat
Ha ha, great, Linus beyond excitement.....
This is like a DREAM advertisement for those glasses.
The tonight show should bring Linus in for a reoccurring segment showcasing some new tech to different celebrities. The online community showed out for this video!!
Careful,  he'll try to sell you a terrible laptop that he is invested in.
Linus was the face of NCIX back in the day.  NCIX was the best place to get all your new PC hardware.  It was great to see Linus on real TV!
Its funny seeing someone like Linus with millions of views getting so nervous being on TV
Linus wiped out half his subs over poor business practices along with questionable explanation of issues and had to stand down as CEO, He is just continuing his rebranding efforts
The X real 1 Pros were crazy to see
"How do they do that?" "Don't worry about it"😂
Watching Linus be nervous initially but get more comfortable talking about tech as it's something he loves, gave me such a relatable experience cause of how immersed I get when I'm surrounded by technology. Growing up watching LTT he was and still is one of my idols I'd love to meet one day❤
Imagine you are so desperate to be on tv you choose Kimmel. Sad and unsubbed Linus.
And watching the hosts geek out over the stuff he bought and started explaining....oh damn that's precious
linus pulls WAY more viewers than this dopey sock
Well done Linus! It's wild to see you on a Late Show, as I've watched  your content since I was 14 or 16. Now, I'm 3x years old. 😅  🎉 Congratulations and hopefully more to come. They say your first time is the quickest and most nervous you'll ever be. The pleasure comes on the 2 time round. 😉 I'll take myself out, on a segue to our sponsor.
This is the werdeist mix up I could have thought about
I’ve never seen a more unlikely paring than Linus and Bad Bunny.
This is the best Tonight Show I loved for all times. Represent the tech community Linus
MAKE THIS EVERY WEEK!
Auntie isn’t a word, it’s spelled and pronounced “aunt” - speak English
Never thought a 40 yr old would explain waifus on live tv 😂😂
You can tell how nervous he is
Seeing Linus feels like I'm in an alternate reality nothing feels right now
Lenovo surely has some deep pockets creating an ad like that
Awesome video! Linus is one of the best techtubers!
I am hoping now when I tell my non-tech colleagues bout LTT, they will recognize Linus as that person from The Tonight Show.
This should be a regular segment, maybe once a month Linus shows up with some insane gadget
I watch Linus occasionally, but i absolutely loved this i actually watched it twice in a row. 😂
LINUS!?!?!?!?
Massive congratulations Linus!! We'll deserved and recognition to everything you've brought to the Tech community!! You rock... even with the socks and sandals! lol
not what i was expecting
This gotta be one of the best performing videos on this channel now. 1.5M views in 1 day.
🔥  Congratulations Linus
jimmy and his fake laughs
He’s wearing SOCKS AND SANDALS on the national TV. Never change Linus
great to see this guy on a big screen (of my mobile phone ). as he started from low quality videos on YouTube (when my phone screen was smaller)
Now, China doesn't get all the attention now does it😂😂😂
WE MADE IT BOYS!!!!!! Massive congrats on getting to be be a guest on The Tonight Show 💙
I wonderif linus lobbied to use his backpack instead of whatever table they wanted to station all the tech stuff 😄
The fact Linus got the word Wifu to a world wide television audience is hilarious.
Gosh, I never thought to see Linus here. What a wonderful surprise.
This video is like when you visit your techie friend's house and he shows you all his cool shit. And you are excited about it for a while and then bitch about him being a nerd later.  But props to Linus for showing people what tech geeks obsess about.
Linus being nervous becuase there's a crowd, but the reality is there's less people watching him on tv than view his video 10 minutes after the channel posts.
Lying Linus
wow his boss really blessed him
It's great to see him get some good coverage out here in the US. Him and his team have done an incredible job with the channels. Love you Linus keep up the good work and I hope to see you LTX some day.
Linus, Jimmy and Bad Bunny was not the combination I ever thought I was going to see, but it's pretty darn cool!
1.5 Mil views!
No LTTstore shoutout?? Nahhh
Insert Obligatorily LTT Backpack Sponsorship  Loved seeing Linus on the tonight show. Not a viewer or late night but this was a cool cross over.
I've never seen linus this energized
Look who it is 😅 feels a little bit like all of us nerds made iton the TV with him
Where is the Sponser? 😂😂😂
While I'm not a fan of LTT and their consOOmer fake IT persona (which I had liked them before they changed), I think TV like this need to more reaching out to creators the internet, who are the real audience.  We have all known that TV number are drastically inflated, they are not actually getting people watching TV becasue most of it is just shotgun broadcasted to networks that lie about their viewership. On top of the fact that most TV is not being watched, it's just on a TV at a store, office waiting room, care home, etc. Of course the internet is mostly bots these days, but the people consuming content, are on the internet, not watching TV. So it's surreal seeing internet personality on TV, despite TV being the much less popular medium. Hell, even TV has stated how internet streaming is where all the money and consuming is, but impossible to break into, because you have actual viewers and they are deciding what they want to watch.  It's a threat to a boomer industry that is on it's deathbed.
I think this is the longest I've ever seen Fallon NOT talk LMAO. Well done, Linus!
Because of Linus.. I now learned today that bad bunny was not a woman. Ive only heard the name sometimes for some reason in places.
First time I've ever seen Linus nervous.
LTT on the tonight show was not on the 2025 bingo card
Lad did good.. finished strong
Dunno if he was nervous or excited but either way, Linus nailed it.
Lets go Linus! So happy for that dude
Wat
Damm I am really happy for linus
Yoo that's crazy
Who tf is bad bunny lol
Great Job, Linus! You fell straight into your groove after you started.
This should be a regular spot - Jimmy was well impressed - Linus you dog!!!!! Excellent
I'm shocked Linus didn't plug his merch lol
This was genuinely so cool. It's so surreal seeing Linus be in the sidecar for a show and even then, when he was given his chance to lead he took it and did amazingly.
going in there without luke is def bold of him😂😅
Wow it's weird to see Linus visibly nervous. New media is far more important and reaches a much wider audience than this legacy media stuff, clearly the whole 'celebrity' thing still has an effect though.  Evening talk shows are nothing in comparison to any big YouTuber but you wouldn't know it watching this.
linus?
First knocked loose and now Linus. I didn't know Jimmy was down like that
Did you get the glasses back from Bad Bunny 😎
nunca me imaginé ver a Linus y al conejo en un solo video, se siente irreal 🚬🗿
Linus was SOOO bervous, like if someone would have asked him about the harasement acusations...
Linus killed it, awesome job
I love how Linus is so used leading the show that he instinctually shows the audience first and foremost, as well as speaking to the crowd every now and then :D
this was awesome!! need more of this!!
I'm so happy for Linus
ahh lefties and pedos in one place
Linus just got a shit ton of new followers and I love it. I have been watching him when he was NCIX since I was in college and he’s built an empire out of tech reviews and dropping things. 😂😂😂 love to see it
I thought he's gonna pull out a 5090 from bag 😭😭
cooking tupa tapa ti
I'm glad to see Linus supporting these smaller channels
Sell out
Let's fucking go!!!! He made it!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Everybody making jokes about Linus supporting smaller creators, but taking a look at the view numbers for the latest couple of weeks on this channel, this one clearly attracts more viewers than most of the other. There is something to it, it seems.
They didn't let him plug lttstore, but he made sure he got his backpack in there anyway lol
We got LTT x Bad Bunny collab before gta 6
Broooo linus da makeup dude
That was a joy.
The irony the LTT probably averages way more views these days.
Haha this felt so weird! I like Jimmy, and have followed Linus for years but this was icky... like my 2 favourite foods touching on the plate 😂 You can't have him primetime.... Linus belongs with us in the valley of the nerds 😉
yooooooo linussssssss
apple, new MacBook please
the display glasses. how bad of eye sight will they compensate for?
Woah wtf
I want that gaming Glasses!
this giving me the highschool bully interested in tech so he rang the tech nerd kid vibe
Just like that, Xreal's stock prices doubled.
How much coffee did you take, dude?
Not even live tv can get Linus out of socks and sandals.
Why can't you see it in Germany? Hello, Linus can be seen all over the world, and the interview isn't? A shame! F
I cringed harder at that waifu moment than when people in my class found out I watched My Little Pony 13 years ago
Two goofballs with ruined reputations trying to create views is somehow working? What's wrong with people?
crazy seeing a real human on a talk show
Linus Linus Linus, im so happy for you.
Where was the water bottle 😂
Linus started interviewing Jimmy 😂
I love Linus :)
Linusssss ❤
🤩🤩
where is the segue ?
Did Linus really wear the sandals socks combo to the Jimmy Fallon!?!?
I have never seen him so nervous before! Truly refreshing seeing someone who has made so much content and has interacted with so many people still feel this way at times. I feel bad as it is kind of painfully obvious for a good bit, haha. You could literally see and hear the marker shake in Linus' hand as he puts it back in the jar!
The one time Linus is not in charge, his entire personality changes 😮
We got Bad Bunny shaking hands with Linus Tech Tips before GTA VI
Damn! Linus is movin up in the world. 😎
This part of the show was brought to you by LTT
Gosh i have gotten a hate for late night shows xD their so scummy when it comes down to it, if they dont profit they will just change opinions and stance entirely, but i have never seen Linus this anxious behind a camera xD
For thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘Once more (it is a little while) I will shake heaven and earth, the sea and dry land;   Time to come out of the world believe in God's love and Jesus who died for our sins. Have faith in Jesus and he will comfort you. Repent the time is now.
I’ve never seen Linus so nervous, but he killed it!
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
F all of u f Nerdcos amigos or not i got dis
It's pretty surprising and amazing to see Linus alongside Bad Bunny. I know a lot of english-only speakers dont know bad bunny and thus can't see how impressive he is, but to put things into perspective: here in Mexico I dont know a single person who doesnt know who he is.
And the segway to a sponsor?
It's so endearing to see Linus nervous after all these years. Been following him since 2010 or 2011 and it's been a blast to see his growth.
I love the fact that even in real TV he’s wearing sandals!
Jimmy totally looks like Jeff Goldblum in those specs :D
Nice way to start the new year Linus, let the world see your passion for tech. 💪🏾
Who is this guy ? Is he some overclocker? Oh no its that guy that acts like he knows something,and acts that he can solder something.... and than lets other guys do it for him... than sell kids 700$ bags 🤦‍♂️  Reading from paper doesnt make you a tech genius!!!
Linus being on here is pretty cool, but I still can't stand Jimmy lol.
Those products from CES were wildly unexpected and very cutting edge. I was like wait there is actually cool stuff that I have never seen before?
Managed it without dropping anything. This is truly special!
😅I was not expecting this...
Thanks so much for the opportunity. You and your team were amazing today and made this experience unforgettable! -LS
About time
This is absolutely wild, good job for Linus!!
Was that the whole segment? He didn't even say much for us to clip out of context.
I've been getting into LTT recently and have recently made my first ever PC build, and I was going through my yt feed and thought, "omg I didn't know Linus had been on Jimmy Fallon before!" and little did I know this was only a couple of days ago...
We got Linus explaining what 'waifu' means on national TV before GTA 6
feeling like a proud son
Bring Linus back again! Loved his segment!
Holy fuck, i never tought that I will be here! 😅❤
where was the segwey?
Mainstream Linus! We love to see it!
Linus and bad bunny on jimmy fallon is not what I expected at all.
This collaboration is insane 😂
Man this is crazy. As a tech addict who is a former IT technician, now a game dev, I literally saw this man grow while giving solid advices. Him and his team deserve that exposure ! LFG LTT 🔥❤️
how much makeup does lunis have on  jezus!!!!
Jimmy again with the condescending tone "learning something new every day" and looking over to Bad Bunny, as in "get a load of this guy".
BRO WOW
Linus is so cute 😍😍😍😍😍
He need some hair tips
A few more inches would be nice😭😭
And when you didn’t even think it was possible, Linus just got MORE famous
Did I just watch whole house water cooling guy on Late Night?   Nice one, Linus!
Also, please get MKBHD on the show.
Looking forward to the WAN Show this week !
Not a single word from today's sponsor....
Huh he is buffed! 😘
Is Linus high? 🤔
When I opened the home feed I thought there was a bug or something. I'm used to find Jimmy and Linus in separate videos, not combined in the same one. You go Linus, you finally made it onto TV!
Kinda surprised Jimmy never heard the term “waifu” before
Good to see Linus getting recognised in the real TV world 😂😂😂 he's well nervous though and he's in front of cameras daily 😂😂
2:27 someone needs to teach him the culture 😆
Great sense of fashion!😂
He looked so nervous lol.
Jimmy looks like Elton John with those glass on :D
???? I have 1,000 hours of Linus, he is reading a script and is the most nervous I have ever seen him, ever. Idk why, jimmy was the reason I had cable but then it went woke 10 years ago and I never watched jimmy again until today.
So cool!!!!
Linus sounds nervous throughout... BUT the moment he starts talking about tech, he is in control of the room
This segment was actually pretty cool lmao
You did great!
Linus is carrying the segment.
I love techs
Linus was so nervous. You can feel that no matter what Youtube giant he is, he still gets excited like any of us would get if we were on TV. I'm so happy for him!
Congrats Linus and LTT
okokok gj linus
I understand the nervousnea from Linus but you did good as soon as you set in and started talking tech. You heard him calm down when talking about the people in his dms asking for advice on working in tech or being inspired
He completely took over the show as soon as you mentioned CES. it became The Tonight Show with Linus Sébastien
🎉2 Corinthians 3:17 - "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." No matter what you’ve done, seek God's freedom today! God loves you and has a good and perfect plan for your life! 🫶🏾🙌🏾
Does he return next year again with cool CES stuff?
So did the guy get to go home with the glasses he put in his Jacket pocket?
all the penis jokes he slipped in , nice
Him being so nervous is actually so cute.
Linus in this segment is like the Steve Irwin of tech. So enthusiastic and such a pleasure to watch!
He’s the bill nye of tech.
Linus you PROFESSIONAL, bravo sir.
Aw he's really made it
awesome to see Linus supporting the smaller creators!!!
Its crazy that ive been watching him since ncix days lol
I love to see Linus so nervous, he’s still a man of his people. A true nerd ❤️
Linus is a champ for doing this! @LinusTechTips
why does jimmy seem so disinterested? this is the best guest he has had on the show?
what about the segue?
Why does bro look like hes tweakin 😂
@LinusTechTips *whispers.... You have more views than Jimmy Fallon. He should've been more nervous :)
Omg this insane Linus Congats ❤❤
worlds collide! this made me smile huge.
seeing nervous linus is buzzy as, considering i view LTT in a WAY higher regard than dumb tv
The glass looks amazing
This is the weirdest collab I’ve ever seen LTT tech nerd and bad bunny ???
I like how the composition of the audience means color-changing sunglasses are cooler than a flappin' rollable, transforming screen, LAPTOP with the push of a button. I'm kind of amused that barely anyone in the audience or on the stage reacted to Bad Bunny's bit, thought it was a clean simple bit of fun. Surprised Linus was... "young person"-ing it up so much with the waifus and the eternal discussion of sizes that are either 14 inch growers or 160 inches wide, but as expressive as the hosts' reactions were, I don't think the full impact was made on the audience - a darn shame, since that last one would be the supremely mind-blowing party trick for normies like me...  I can't tell how much of Linus' on screen persona is him playing up the stereotype or his nerves lol this is a dude who hosts his own tech conventions and sometimes meets thousands of people in a day!!
Se le salio el dominicano diablooo😂😂
Sorry Linus, I just cant bring myself to watch 8 minutes of Jimmy Fallon, its too painful
Didn't Fallon attend Diddy-parties? Or was that the other Jimmy?
Linus explaining the concept of a wifu to Jimmy Fallon is priceless.
Specs on the tech showcased
he really put on the act.. wtf
Youtubers saving Talkshows. 😂
Did they mess up the live feed of the gameplay? It looks like it was supposed to be showing what Jimmy could see in the glasses, surely?
That was so cool to see. I have been following LTT for many years. Very educated when he is not breaking or dropping things but fun to watch and learn. That's what brought me my passion for the last 25 years in the IT industry. So cool!
We can all see Linus' excitement to be in the show. 😀 proud for you, buddy.  But where is our segment to our sponsor?
wow, linus is such a clown
It’s so cool seeing someone I’ve been watching for so long time build his craft to this level
I've been watching this guy since I was around 15 years old... I'm 31 now 😂 (all the way back in the NCIX days).  Working as a software developer today.   Linus had definitely made an impact on me, and has taught me so much about computers and technology.  Thanks Linus and Luke ❤ and the rest of the team of course!
Linus, proud of you bud!
For as long as I watched Linus, I never knew his last name is Sabastian. 💀💀
He should grow the beard back.
Awwww daddy
I did not have bad bunny playing baulders gate on my 2025 bingo card
OK, HOW IS BAD BUNNY THERE WTF???
What the heck
Not a single mention of LTT Store???? Buddys lost his edge! 😂
Nervous Linus is the most precious thing.  You rock! 🥰
Linus done us tech lot proud.
He's so excited about this
I hope they got Linus' autograph.
this is the CRAZIEST segue to a sponsor ever.
holy shit he is so nervous. what a dude
This made me SOOOO DAMN HAPPY! Linus was so nervous but once that backpack was mentioned he got into his element. He should've mentioned they have sex toy tech there also lmfao Cnet has been crazy with their posts about that lol
That bro his high ass hell!
Awww, this is so cute! As a fan of LTT I can't believe how obviously nervous and excited Linus is!  Haha
THE LESBIAN MADE IT TO TV?!
Lol, poor thing, he was trying so hard but the nerves won.
Linus is the reason why I decided to build my own pc in the first place, it's an awesome feeling building your first pc.
@LinusTechTips - been watching since the NCIX days! Keep it up my man!
Linus is awesome, amazing to see even Boomer tv shows party attn to what's going on in the real world
Do You Want To Live The Experience? https://youtu.be/5tRh1XFFhkk?si=zSIff5TG5PYZwuqh
Wan show will be interesting.
I don't know these boys.  But that kid's enthusiasm is inspiring.  Bless them
Linus shaking hands with Bad Bunny is something I never thought I'd watch in my life
Who’s the Mexican
Why is Bad Bunny giving Fallon reach arounds behind the desk? Lol seriously looks awkward AF.
wild ass timeline we’re in
electrochromatic
Damn. That Delicious YT Collaboration Algorithm... 😂 Nice one Linus...
Wow I never thought I'd see Jimmy Fallon on a LTT video, he's really coming up in the world!
I  like this
XR glasses on a handheld have improved my computing experience a ton. Glad to see them promoted on TV.
Jimmy's finally hit the big time, interviewing Linus Sebastian himself.
First
He did surprisingly well lol
I am distracted by the obvious makeup on him lmao but that's just the norm for tv
Linus tech tips and bad bunny was not on my bingo card for 2025
Literally the only time I've bothered to see this show. 😂
YouTube’s IT department is supposedly a TV’s department as well
Good job Linus!
Of all the YouTubers to sit in that chair, I'm glad you picked Linus. Ytf are you letting Bad Bunny behind the desk though?
the fact that linus is for some reason on real tv once again for some reason is a small sliver of hope for popular media
Linus dropping some tips!!
Cool!!
Who is Bad Binney?
I grew up watching Linus Tech Tips and they thought me a lot of things.
Good for him, no cap.  If anything, the very rl awkwardness at the start just speaks to the still-present GULF between mainstream & nu-media or whatever yall be calling it nowadays  Edit:  hope it ends up being a recurring segment for him - his enthusiasm saved that whole-ass segment
Ni me di cuenta que estaba bad bunny ahi JAJAJSKS
Such an unexpected collab. Can't wait to hear about this for an hour straight on WAN Show this week
LTT on Fallon! I've never seen Linus that nervous!
Linus did such a good job. That was awesome. I am super proud of him
Only here for Linus 🎉
how in the .. Who booked Linus?
it's awesome to see Linus on the tonight show
LINUS IS FROM MY CITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love this dude
O shit youtube is taking over TV.
What timeline is this?
This wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t clarify what he meant by “hard r”
He was totally nervous at first but once he started demoing the tech he totally hit his flow state and killed it. Really awesome to see this.
This is the first time I ages I’ve gone looking for a video from the tonight show.
Bad Bunny thinkin he's slick LOL
I was expecting Linus to spontaneously say "Just like this segue to our sponsor".
Just here to support @LinusTechTips and hope I can keep following you on YouTube for more 16 years in the future.  Thank you so much for helping me build my first Pc and all the following ones that came after.  Great hug Linus and all the LTT team!
Supporting linus with a comment
I can definitely see Jimmy and Bad Bunny hanging out and be friends. They have chemistry and Jimmy loves music. Imagine a real collab lol.
Those socks and sandals 😂😂 never change Linus
Just like #Diljit , #Linus is ❤️ by all. Both are GOATs & thanks to Jimmy for bringing them to your show.
More Linus. More Linus!
When you can pull up on national TV in socks and sandals and not give a fuck you know you've made it.
Who gave Linus cocaine
You wouldn’t download a tech tip would you? Congrats Linus
Love listening to Linus talk
The views ratio for this video compared to others is wild lmao
Nice job Linus, you were hella nervous but did a good job
I'm glad it's Linus and not MKBHD
Awesome!!!
I've never seen Linus's hair as slick as that.
OMG LINUS TECH TIPS!!!
Well done Linus - great to see you up there doing your thing.  You should have given Jimmy and Bunny a screwdriver! LOL - I want that Laptop btw!
Im here for Linus baby!!!
The most unlikely collab of personalities and I’m all for it
Make it a recurring segment
I would love a segment where cool products like this are displayed. kinda like some of the older segments from Jay Leno.
Last time I saw Linus this nervous I a video was their main storage/project server died and he was on the phone with a data recovery service
Go Linus!🎉 I love this!
WAN Show gonna be awesome!
Linus has more make up in his nose than a woman in all the face
He is so excited and nervous 😂
Hype
Just watch the views ratio compared to some other celebrities.. YouTube really is another world.
So crazy seeing linus on here 😂
Been watching Linus for a long time. I'm so proud of him and his team
I'm I the only one that saw Linus bringing his nerd persona on the stage and playing as such? I mean look at his hair style, its a dead give away. He was very funny
Linus got the word “Waifu” on national television, wild 😂
How do they work?  Linus: don’t worry about it, magic  Translation: I have no idea
I don’t usually care for late night shows, but this was GOOD.  The energy, the curiosity, the WOW… from Jimmy and Bad Bunny, and Linus’ presentation, all VERY, VERY GOOD.
I'm just going to say it. I'm proud of you man. Job well done..
Ok i know a lot of you hate this joke and are sick and tired of it but I genuinely cant believe  We Got Linus TT on the Jimmy Fallan Show Before GTA6 now that is crazy
Where can i get those glasses?
ngl I thought this was AI until I read the comments
I bet all his childhood bullies are rolling over right now.
Great to see an actual star on the show for once!
Wow it's Linus! 👏👏👏
Finally NCIX has made it to the top.  ;-)
I’ve seen him for a good while now since 2019 hes sure knows his stuff
What a neeeerd! Lol jk congrats on being on tv linus!
Bad bunny just robbed Linus. That was not on my 2025 bingo card.
It's funny to see regualr people blown away by new tech like it's black magic
Nice backpack where did you get it? 😏
Well deserved man😊
Linus tech tips is on youtube right now 😂😂bruh hes on youtube before you guys were ever made a video 😂
Omg línguas was shaking lmao
Linus Sex Tips
Make up crew is kinda bad tho, linus looks overly done
LINUS!
OMG he is so nervous i feel bad but happy at the same time.
Oh Lord, why would you go on this hack's show, Linus? EDIT: Never mind, I was thinking Jimmy Kimmel. Good ad for your channel though, yeah?
This is honestly so wholesome, you can’t help but be happy for Linus
I gotta get me that waifuu and wearable glasses...  ❤
Wow I've never seen him so exited & about to cry 😂😭♥️ This dude deserves all of this & more. I love atleast he can brag about this to MKBHD 😂
Killed it
Which brand and model number are the xr glasses?
i wonder if this is the full version .. id love to see all of the parts with linus in it.  maybe Jimmy should get to visit and be in a few LTT videos to see what its like. amazing how  linus started in 2008 i rememeber seeing random vids of how to vids for teck back in 04.
Good on Linus for supporting these guys
this dude have at least 500 bitcoins
Two worlds i never expected to collide😂
So much free marketing, I'm surprised more companies didnt want to give Linus stuff to show off tbh
dream blunt rotation te lo juro
I think i seen his heart beat through is shirt .
Nice to see Linus keeping it real with the socks and sandals!
2:20 how and where and when and how much
3:55 comedy relief always helps the nerves!
You giys managed to make him not look so short
Make "Tech Tips with Linus" a repeat thing @tonightshow
6:03 "woah! how do they do that?" *"...dont worry about it"*  😭
those sunglasses look like something out of cyberpunk! theyre so cool!!
Dude I have never ever seen Linus like this lmfao, good for you dude that’s awesome!
See the video Just now 😊
Nice video 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Love to see this, and how nervous and excited he was! 😂
It’s so odd to see Linus nervous for something
The part where he takes everything  back... 😅 like they couldn't just pay him ahead of time to keep those items?
Linus isn't small anymore. He's still short but not small
BTW, did you recover the "Lost" eyeglasses 😅
Lol I never watched a single OFallon show but for Linus I watch it.
Nick Burns?!
I never watch this show, just watching it for this
Dang who’s that sexy guest you have on there?
Never heard of this Jimmy Fallon guy but I wish him and his rabbit do well.
He made it.
Omg, sure enough he hit the tv powder stash before entering the stage haha
HOLY CRAP LINUS MADE IT TO THE TONIGHT SHOW!
what timeline are we living in
nice to see linus take time out of his day to help bring attention to smaller channels
Good Job Linus ...
the collab no one asked yet we all deserved.
Bro I was nervous watching this but he pulled it off
The man that saved my life. I am so proud of him.  Edit: I cannot believe this man brought a backpack. 😂
That was awesome and that tech he showed off was legit cutting edge, cool, And I hadn't seen it before.  And I see most new tech.
watched cause of linus.
LINUS!!!!!
you can tell linus starts out nervous,  but once he starts talking about his element, he is at his game.    This is guy is the reason a lot of people are in the tech industry.     I love that bad bunny  is so cool and chill,  a puerto rican just like me  representing.  love this show.
What show is this? Who is that guy next to Linus?
Linus was nominated for Biggest Douche in the Universe. He won.
This is pretty cool but I'll be honest I was really hoping for a Ltt Store plug lol
Congrats Linus!
Literally one of Jimmy's most watched vids 😂
nice ads
Commuter backpack spotted
Jimmy, this is the real deal guest!
Living the dream, that's Linus.
You can see Linus is out of his element but when he gets into it he goes off and they were impressed Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny 😁😅😂🤣
Crazy how this guy probably pulls more views than Fallon, and his first joke about being on "real tv" flies straight over the boomer audience's head
Can I have a free pc springs to mind 😂 0:51 if he had a video for each time he’s been asked he would have another great channel with more than enough videos lmao
Amazing content as always!
Thank you for the great content!
This man sit behind camera probably thousand of hours yet he still nervous when he on TV. 😂
Very well done, appreciate this video!
I'M SO HAPPY FOR LINUS THIS IS HUGE!!!!!!!
LTT Store backpack
Oh nice, cool to see a longer version, a few more minutes is always nice😘 This should've been the one that was broadcasted. I've been part of Linus' community for just under 1.5 years, and while I can tell he was super nervous at first, he settled into the segment pretty fast. Ya did good, Linus, told ya you'd be great! 🖤🧡
Linus Tonight Tips
It's amazing to see YouTubers like Linus pulling in numbers like these. He's clearly nervous for any long time viewers of his content, but he did great. I can't wait to hear about this experience on the WAN show this week!
3:58 “A few more inches would be nice” Bad Bunny’s face: 😐😏😁
jimmy fallen has never had such a big audience before
Thanks for the tech tips.
It's so surreal seeing two of my worlds (music by bad bunny and tech from LTT) come together on tv!
Vancouver, BC talent rising up!
Linus!!!!
Holy awkward guy
Completely sold on them XReal One Pros 😎
Where's the tiny cellphones 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Huge day for us nerds
Steve from GN fuming rn lmao , he just took a shot at linus again lol in his latest lawsuit video
Linus you rocked it!  Way to go para-social friend!
Tell me why I saw that guy on the train 🚆
It's endearing to see someone as successful and confident as Linus get nervous on live TV.  That's not a weakness, it takes a lot of courage as it shows room to grow and the confidence and willpower to rise to the challenge that will result in growth.
Only here for Linus. Nobody cares about Fallon, The Tonight Show, NBC, or legacy media.
It's giving Steve Irwin vibes...
Linus! so proud of you dude!! YOU ARE THE MAN!!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
My fellow Canadian Boy!
Holy shit Linus is nervous AF.
i never thought id see the day that Linus would be explaining what a waifu is to Jimmy
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Holy crap, Jimmy got to meet a huge celebrity like Linus. Congrats! 🎉
Loved the content, keep it coming!
What is happening here
The fact he still chose to wear his own merch and still own the socks with sandals. This man got nothing to hide 😆 long live the king!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Very very cool! 😎
This guy is an SNL character 😅
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Linus and Bad bunny together was not in my 2025 bingo card
How did you get into contact with Jimmy Fallon?
You explained this so well, thank you!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
love you LTT!
We need more segments like these on the tonight show! I can't wait for my commuter backpack to arrive ;)
Even when he was nervous, he managed to do it and directed everyone on the show.
This was super helpful, thanks!
Thank you for the great content!
Linus is always de man
This was super helpful, thanks!
Love these 3. Such a great matchup, great vibes and so much fun to watch!
Can anyone point me in the direction of how the sun glasses work?
This was very informative, appreciate it.
I’m so happy this happened!!!!
You explained this so well, thank you!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
1:30 in and he's normal Linus instantly. Love it dude, congrats. I'd have pissed myself lol
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Thank you for the great content!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Amazing
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Linus did a great job!
Meh
Missed opportunity not letting linus call the ad break with a Segway  to the sponsor
"Have you ever looked down and thought a few more inches would be nice" is an insane quote good job Linus
not a single link to LTT...
I wouldn't have had the confidence to build my first pc ever by myself without Linus' YouTube help. That's how I found him in the first place. 🙏GG dude you made it 👌
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Bro said "Humanoid Waifu Robot" in national tv, legend. Also in 6:53 i believe Linus intended to show Jimmys POV but they just showed the console screen, not the glasses.
I’m so glad LTT got some spot light. Keeping making tech accessible to the newbs.
Great job, this video was very useful!
holy crap that joke hit hard
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Amazing content as always!
Amazing content as always!
Why am I here
Good job linus
Loved the content, keep it coming!
One of the best channels on YouTube. Linus seems so cool, happy he gets some recognition
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Cringe
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
why linus look nervious
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
"Getting some work done... Look down and thought a few more inches would be nice" 🤣🤣🤣💀
Our boi made it!
If you told me two years ago that we would see Linus in the same room with Bad Bunny I most likely would've not believe you. Its crazy as a Hispanic who listens to Bad Bunny and a gamer (somewhat pc enthusiast) who started watching LTT during covid to see this.
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
ucking loser, fake azz peanuts linus
Holy moly. Huge for Linus!
Yes, can't believe Linus Tips is on this TV show! Well deserved, far  more and much better than some of the other Hollywood celebrities that are out there these days. Sorry to say it like that.
Can’t wait for the WAN show over this, Luke is gunna be entertaining on this for sure!  Good job though loved the nervous energy man, watching you since your NCIX days so it’s awesome to see how far you’ve come, keep it up!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
What, no segue?  You can get that backpack at LTT Store LOL
Hey Bro.  That is my Canadian dude Linus.
Holly cow
Annoying little rodent as a human. People still watch him?
The nervousness our poor Linus 😂
Very well done, appreciate this video!
When you are home for Christmas and showing your parents how to use their technology.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
You explained this so well, thank you!
I never thought I’d see Linus and Bad Bunny in the same frame
Edit: Three of the most unlikeable guys in entertainment today
Was it also sponsered by Lenovo or by these companies? or maybe they just gave him by chance to test and maybe show it on the show?
Too bad all this stuff wasn't out when Nicole Kidman went visit Jimmy,  he'd have NEVER known she was there!!!🤣😂🤣😂
Great job, this video was very useful!
HOLY BALLS ITS LINUS SEBASTIAN ON JIMMY FALLON LOOOOL
not surprised they didnt know about Waifu. Imagine they exploring Anime xD
Fallon can't get views, so he has to farm YouTubers.  Seems like "tech" is too hard for Jimmy to steal, so unlike Sean Evan's bit, Jimmy actually allows Ljnus to sit down and be interviewed.  Jay Leno killed late night; Fallon is just the stench of its rotting corpse.  I can't wait for these bit-stealing, no talent hacks to totally disappear.
What a charming interview I'm so used to seeing Linus composed
So what happened to the glasses?
Well done Linus. Keep living the dream my friend.
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Who the hell is Bad Bunny? lol
So Great to see Linus on a show like this sharing the love of tech!
LTT backpack let's go!
Congratulations Linus
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Great job, this video was very useful!
Congrats Linus you killed it bro!!!!!
It's nice how he progressively calms down lol
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT DIRTY JOKE AT 3:52???
Congrats Linus🎉 I was so waiting for... Jimmy: What else is in this backpack?  Linus: This segway...😂
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
The beard would've been amazing here :( Miss it.
Great job, this video was very useful!

the extra inch computer screen is great but those changing color glasses are super lit

This video was amazing, learned a lot.

Monthly tech segment with Linus Sebastian on The Tonight Show!
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Love to see LTT on primetime! Congrats team
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
I never comment on youtube videos but this was so good i questioned if it was an ai experiment at first 😂 happy to see a nerd hit near celebrity status and get into the mainstream
Thank you for the great content!
Watching Linus dial in his energy was cool, well done 👍
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
bless him his heart is overclocking being on that stage
Bad Bunny: 🗿
You got it Linus🎉🎉🎉
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
I have NEVER felt more parasocial in my life. CONGRATS LINUS 🎉🎉🎉
You explained this so well, thank you!
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
And he didn't plug the water bottle.
Amazing content as always!
Freakin awesome, so proud of Linus.
I still can't believe a tech tuber was invited to Late Night television...
Wan show gonna be lit this Friday
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Very well done, appreciate this video!

Loved this video, keep up the great work!
You explained this so well, thank you!
I can't stand Fallon as an interviewer - he's always interrupting people. Having Linus on was a smart move - 1.2M and growing.
Diablo cabron jajajajja
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Bad bunny and Linus together was not in my 2025 bingo card lol
Been watching Linus for many years but has never seem him this nervous, kinda gives me comfort knowing huge creators like these are also like the rest of us
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
I hope this becomes a regular thing and they bring Linus back on a regular basis.
Short Linus
So glad to see Linus get recognition outside of a tech channel. Very well deserved.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Amazing content as always!

i think they should introduce this tech segment in the future
Bad Bunny, Jimmy Fallon, and Linus. That's a trio I never thought I'd see
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Was hoping for a shameless LTT store plug 😂😂
I was waiting for a segue to your sponsor...
Amazing content as always!
Linus killed it!  Started off in typical awkward Linus fashion and nailed the products!  Love it so much!!!

This guy was great! I wonder if he has any good Tech Tips? Also i wonder if he knows where i can buy a good screwdriver?
Amazing content as always!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
We just watched a relearn curve. Different vibe, different camera, different audience ... a couple new skills to get calm with. I see this being a 3 times a year thing ... just like historic Tonight Show animal visits. What will be interesting is maybe any bump to the LTT youtube channel algorithm, or new subs. ... next time, dont over comb the hair.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
this is the one time the guest was more hyper than jimmy (linus is generally animated, just this time a little more so, and understandably as a canadian youtuber)
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
🌟✊️❤️
Linus not shilling for llt store when jimmy mentions the back pack missed opportunity
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
That was cool! Long time LTT viewer here and it's great to see him doing something outside of YouTube :)
Thank you for the great content!
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
I love how Linus feels a sense of accomplishment at making it on "real" TV, when he has undeniably been instrumental in disrupting and redefining what "real" TV is for so many of us. For me, Linus and crew are about as real as it gets! ❤🤘
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Linus will have to talk about this visit on the WAN Show this Friday
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Amazing content as always!
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
This was super helpful, thanks!
I hope we get Linus back in here after every big tech conference. Like a modern animal segment.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
This has a live animal segment vibe but with tech, I love it.
I think all the LTT and Floatplane fan boys are chiming in 9n the comments 💯
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Cool to see Linus on late night TV. Love his YouTube channels
6:20 ACTUALLY YOINKIIIIING!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
The mask did linus hair. Never seen him with this straight hair😂
Not Linus explaining what a waifu is on national television
This was super helpful, thanks!
The way he talks on the show like he's a nerd excited to share his knowledge to the people listening, just shows how linus really loves what he's doing. Respect!
Let’s goooo!
Me trying to explain my hyperfixation to my GF
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Canadian boy from Vancouver!🍁🇨🇦🍁🇨🇦
3:33 the way he show the laptop with this fake proud face and this little smile ... love it !!
Jimmy Fallon is the worst tv host of all time :D
3:28 - I was hoping he'd pull out a dbrand Segway
I love it.  Linus could be the Jack Hanna of Tech for Jimmy!
Awesome! 🎉 I hope you’re a regular
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
This whole conversation was awesome. Even 30 seconds in and I’m already smiling and laughing. Linus is carrying this whole conversation, and it’s awesome.
god i hate fallon
Hello fellow nerds!
Linus explaining what a waifu is to Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny before GTA 6
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
So no one’s going to point out how bad bunny just took the glasses???? Lol
Who the fuck is bad bunny
those sunglasses were awesome and they both looked great! take my money
Just look at the views of Jimmy's show. Linus is the true star of the show....Congrats bro!!
Linus is so nervous
Damn I am seeing Linus so nervous and shivering for the first time!
Linus was higher energy than normal. Maybe he thinks you need to emote more on TV than on YouTube. The speed was him trying to get those products demoed and not be bogged down on the "how does it work.". I am surprised he didn't talk about the backpack.
We got Linus on late night television before GTA 6.
Linus is the type of person who wears sandals
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
This was all just Tax writeoff
That was an awesome surprise 😂
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Having Linus on to talk about tech is so cool. I feel like I always cringe when talk shows do a tech segment, but they got a guy who knows his stuff and he picked some great products to get people excited.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
I never thought I would see Linus and Benito on the same screen. What a moment.
conan next
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Ant no way bro missed the opportunity to plug his travel backpack on air!!
It'll be Linus's tech tips from now on.
It's grt seeing guys like Linus being appreciated 🎉, he truly is one of the GOAT when it comes to tech knowledge 🫡
am i the only one that finds this weird af
This channel hasnt seen the views climbing so fast in many years. Proving that Linus is more famous than the Tonight Show at this point...
HEY LETS GO,,, he didnt drop a thing
I haven't seen Linus this nervous in years. I thought he was used to being in front of a camera though this time it was on someone else's terms.
Wtf just happened to Linus? He seems like a 14y old kid so excited........... Jimmy should be the one exited dude... 😅
Fallon trying to get his viewer base back by appealing to tech enthusiasts
I love how Linus acts like a regular guy, not a celebrity, not a company, just a tech geek who is bouncing off the walls to be on Jimmy Fallon
Oh no he still wore sandals with socks 🧦😂
My my, how far we've come.
i still can't believe this is real
Bad Bunny: Yeah, I'm keeping this 🤫😆
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Linus here looks like a kid showing his dad cool toys while the dad pretends to be interested
Lol, I like that this bit did the format of the animal wrangler guests where they bring in a half dozen exotic animals for the host to play with.
You explained this so well, thank you!
Is it just me or Jimmy seems super unconfortable
Linus the Virus
Thanks for inviting our god. Linus seemed really excited to be there which is really nice
Trending on Youtube! Kudos to LTT and Sebastian!
too much makeup
I was really hoping he was gonna be able to sneak in a LTT store promo in there
Linus... top notch man
How convinced Jimmy to put Linus on TV lol.
Wild crossover event
Linus needs to wash his hands after shaking hands with Bad Bunny! They don't know each other, and their personalities are completely opposite!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
7:36 “Diablo cabron”. 😂
Great job Linus!!
Linus being that nervous for being on a big stage in the normal world is the wholesomeness I needed right now.
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Benito se chingo los lentes JAJAJAJAJA
Ugh they must have messed up the glasses POV view
Missed opportunity to explain what is a waifu to the nation lol
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Mainstream media needs more of this!  Bring back Tomorrow's World on BBC1...!!!
Amazing content as always!
Bro forgot to show the screwdriver ?!
Bad bunny  hide and kept the glasses😅😅
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Bro really taught them about waifus
Ahahaha this guy been watching him myself for yeaaaars since he was doing the early goofy camcorder looking stuff lol fucking cool to see him on "real"!! TV lmao  he's such a real dude it's why he does so well 😂
I LOVE LTT WOOO
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
WHAT ?extended? it'ssame as show and you arzes didn't provide a click link too bad Jimmy ain't big enough to carry a full 90-minute late night show... Linus Spoiled that he was bringing 5 or 6 things to the show (Linus's TV premier) meaning he could've easily "double shown" more stuff
Great job, this video was very useful!
Would be cool retirement for Linus - stop doing LTT himself and just bring fun toys to the Tonight Show as a regular segment. You know how Letterman had an animal guy.
Poor Linus. Hes a natural behind his own camera but so nervous like the rest of us on national tv, lol. Good for you man!
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Great job @LinusTechTips. Hopefully this becomes a recurring segment!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
This was very informative, appreciate it.
This is absolutely lovely to watch. Seeing him nervous, but still with socks in sandals, doing the wink when he made that Waifu joke. Amazing. I love this.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
You did great, Linus!
Bro IDK if I get roasted as a parasocial glazer, I'm so glad to have come across LTT in my life - that spark they gave me for IT as a kid is what let me build a great life and hopefully pay it forward
Best performing video in a month for this channel, Linus is king
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Who would've thought that Linus would be on The Late Night show with Jimmy Falon.  Who that this on their BINGO Card?  I know it wasn't on mine.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
i thought this was AI, until i saw it for real lol
Wow Dick Suckem has come a long way.
I feel like this shouldn't have worked as well as it did. Linus actually brought some cool products and his passion for tech is contagious. I love LTT, I hope they have him on more often
Awesome!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Lot of dry mouth in the beginning. Lol  Those immersion glasses were cool as toast
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Amazing content as always!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
I was geeked watching this
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Nice to see you there, Linus :)
wow ok......
Hey our dad is on TV😂
Someone noticed how much view this interview has vs the others. In couple of days it will beat Angelina Joli’s.
Can't believe i am subscribed to both @LinusTechTips and @JimmyFallon
GREAT 👍 VIDEO 📹 AND THANKS 😊 👍 🙏❤ 🙏
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Linus keep up bro your amazing :D
Yeah Linus started off nervously and clearly felt out of place. It was kind of adorable lol. Then, he just picked up steam as he went and it turned into a fun segment. Bring him back every now and then to do this again.
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Bad bunny would be an amazing host on a TV show
So much chaotic energy from Linus. Dude is the biggest tech YT in the world but he’s still that young kid at heart. It’s lovely.
I don't think he got the "a few more inches" joke 4:03
he was so nervous and out of place but he did ok xD
Worlds have collided!
Amazing content as always!
LOL  Go back and look at all the other videos for Jimmy. Jimmy has 32.2m subs, and all of the other TTS vids sit around 200 to 400K  This video with Linus, already has 1.2m views.
Great job, this video was very useful!
I was walking around CES with my XREAL Ones and the show floor map spatially pinned above my head, so I wouldnt get lost. I was constantly stopped by people asking me about the glasses I was wearing and demod it for them. The reaction was shock and awe like what you see from Jimmy and Bad Bunny in this video 😂
Well I wasn't expecting this today 😂
first Jimmy Fallon I've watched in 5 years....
i can't believe we live in a timeline where linus is explaining waifu's to jimmy and bad bunny. this 2025 trial period has been wild
Ain’t no way my man went on national TV with that socks+sandals combo😭😭
I am suprised Linus didn't plug the LTT backpack
Dang, Linus, hold up on the Red Bulls before going on air!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
I remember him from the Tech tv days....🥹
Been watching Linus since his NCIX days! You made it man, you made it.
Amazing content as always!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
How did Linus not say he had an only fans 😂
Linus was like the Jack Hanna of tech, loved it, haha.
It’s so damn great to see Linus reach this milestone of his career after being a subscriber for almost a decade. It genuinely feels so heartwarming and he deserves this so damn much after every controversy he’s been through ❤
Great job, this video was very useful!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Thank you for the great content!
never thought Linus why the nervous type .. damn!!! love how nervous and excited he is
We got Linus in Jimmy Fallon before GTA VI?
Not really a fan of Linus but I’m happy to see how far he’s gotten
You explained this so well, thank you!
linus was in video mode for sure. Not WAN show mode.
my tech world and music world and tv world colliding at once is crazy
Loved the content, keep it coming!
the regeton crap kills the fun of linus being here
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
tf is Linus doing here? He's too good for this show bruh
Jimmy called it a "segment" by the end, is this going to be a recurring thing?
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
What happened to the xreal case from his hand?
This is awesome! Congrats Linus
Why tf bad bunny there
Gj Linus u overcame that nervousness and it was cool to watch
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!

Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Linus being so nervous is hilarious!!!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Who’s the guy on Jimmy’s left? A translator for Canadian into American?  We don’t want no Canadian or English languages, only American 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
lets go linus
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Thanks lenovo for sponsoring our video 😂

What a world we live in. Linus on the bigger screen.
Linus is a savage 😎
You explained this so well, thank you!
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
I feel like Jimmy is not interested at all by Linus and that hurts
Linus was straight geeking, I love it.
I WASN'T HERE, LTT
this is the most hyper i think ive seen linus ever
Dude those display glasses would be great if they could fit over my weird glasses frames. My eyesight is very poor and those would be amazing.  Also, Linus was adorable during this interview
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Yay! Nerds have made it to the real world😂
what is linus even doing there lmaooo
This is awesome! You nailed it Linus!!!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
"Dont worry about it" a.k.a. Itll take your whole show to explain. 😂
I find it amazing that most comments are about Linus and not Bad Bunny tbh. The vibes that Linus gives are something else.
Insane collab
So happy for LTT!
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!

Ok who left Universe Mode on autoplay again?!
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Dude over 1 million views as of this comment, completely trumping the celebrities solo videos…that’s crazy
Jimmy meme-ing the whole time not realizing the power of Linus
the only guy that can make a late night show an in your face ad
I love how Linus is so used leading the show that he instinctually shows the audience first and foremost, as well as speaking to the crowd every now and then :D
Amazing content as always!
So amazing to see such a BIG name supporting up and coming creators. Hopefully this will be Jimmy’s breakout year.
Way to go Linus ;=) Bad Bunny what kind of a name is that lol..
Liuns sounds like shaggy from Scooby Doo
This was very informative, appreciate it.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Linus Sebastien just went on a live TV talk show and said the word Waifu
You explained this so well, thank you!
WTFFFF LTT
Almost 1.2 million views now
You did great, Linux man
Brooooo WHAT?!?!?!??!?! Ive been watching linus for 10 years now this is insane
Dream blunt rotation?
Thanks for inviting him that was so cool and hilarious
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Tech tip
Amazing content as always!
Great job Linus.
Seeing Linus on a major TV show was not on my bingo card for this year!
I watched this video this morning and couple times throughout the day. This makes me smile so much, its so wholesome! Well done Linus 😁
Amazing content as always!
This fucked with my head never expected this 😂
I am dying over how excited Jimmy was and he was just looking at the Ally’s display.
I kept my old ass awake, way passed my bedtime to watch this. I'm blown away how much they actually cut from t 5:25 his for the broadcast. This is an excellent interview.
Thank you for the great content!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Wow congratulations, you have a washed up YouTube has-been that greatly over exaggerates his credentials on the show🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Bad bunny said “ Diablo cabron” when he had the glasses last lol
This is the first time I've ever seen Linus so nervous--but only those who've watched him regularly would be able to tell. So happy he's come so far! <3
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
This was super helpful, thanks!
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
That was great! I have been an avid viewer of LTT for over 10 years. So cool to see him on Fallon. Should be a  regular segment, Linus presents crazy cool tech
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
almost expected dbrand to go over and call him short
Whoa that’s cool!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Wow! Congrads Linus.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
haha funny tech tip man
our guy made it!
I'm so proud of Linus RN!!!!!!
This was great..I enjoyed it, linus did a great job explaining the products.
No fuckin way Linus is on the tonight show. Congrats. I've been watching since NCIX days. Go Canadia
Holy GPU batman....Linus has on some serious TV makeup lol
This was super helpful, thanks!
Linus, by watching this is it's clear how big, exciting and important this was for you.   We are almost the same age and I know how hard it is to find those moments where you feel just like a little child again, completely ecstatic, overwhelmed and over the moon.  So happy for you man, incredibly well deserved!!!
Just like those 90's crossovers that didn't make any sense, like TMNT and Power Rangers.
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
It's like looking at someone that's impersonating/imitating Linus. When you think he can't surprise you anymore. What's gonna be next? Action movies? I can already imagine the plots.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Awww, he was so nervous, poor Linus... He did great though, glad to see the socks and sandals representing! <3 :D
Thank you for the great content!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Fuck after the nerves die down he ends up killing it 🤣
Thank you for the great content!
This is why we love Linus. just that PALPABLE love for tech and unabashed comfort in who he is as a geek, it makes the world a better place.
Linus is so cool
I'm glad they pulled out the booster cushions for Linus! 😂
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
🗣️BOOM
The cross section of legacy media and youtube is so strange. Like, if Fallon started today on youtube with this kind of show, nobody would watch it apart from seeing Linus
Now this is something I did not expect! lol
This was super helpful, thanks!
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
For Linus to come back every year with new tech
Oh damn, this is the first time I've ever seen Linus nervous on camera. He's so excited and I love it.
I had to do a triple read when I read Bad Bunny and Linus in the same sentence. I would never have imagined it!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Never in my life did I ever think I would see Linus and Bad Bunny together on a show. WOW! I am fan of both of them and this is something out of a weird AI dream.
I wouldn't have been able to do nearly as good as him on stage. That said, he looked nervous as HECK 😂😂
No drop? No sponsor?
Amazing content as always!
Hope he returns that tech.
LTT ON JIMMY FALLON???
Jimmy wasnt sure at the beginning, but Linus won them over. What a surreal world we live in
This was great!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Look ma I made it
"This is a 14" laptop from Lenovo" "I'm starting to doubt you Linus" (Jimmy knowing what a laptop is) hahahahaha
Jimmy Is gay
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Who here was waiting for Linus to drop something??? 😂😂😂
As a techie myself and explaining things to non techs is like a brain surgeon trying to explain to a nurse how to do a brain operation 😂
Thank you for the great content!
2025 started a little rough, but this helps me believe the year can still turn out great!
Great job, this video was very useful!
They should have Gamers Nexus on,  a creator with integrity.  I have lost all respect for this channel, and I suggest the people who aren’t Linus jump ship and not let him drag you down with him.  He is a complete sell out and don’t give AF about his community.  You are a sad strange little man…..and you have my pitty.  Gamers Nexus cannot quit dunking on you and I’m here for it.  Eat a bag of wieners Linus.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
This is great! Now I want to see @LinusTechTips bring Jimmy Fallon to his show!
This was super helpful, thanks!
no backpack  or screwdriver plug?
Bro really waifu
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
WHO is this Baby BUNNY . WTF
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Linus on tv? 😁 !!!? Outside of his YouTube space
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Never did I ever think this is a collab I thought would happen 😂
The funny thing is Linus's videos regularly get more views than Fallon. But you can see how nervous he is anyway.
Crazy how this pulled LTT fans, 1M views in a interview in just a few hours is crazy. ngl, I thought I was trippin when I saw the thumbnail and the caption, Fun vid for sure!
So great!!
Yes the multi multi millionaire  MR Linus . So what.
You can tell when he becomes anxious and tries to fill every moment of silence, and when he becomes energized and needs to fill every moment.
Great interview Linus. Been inspired and entertained by your and your team's video for years. More power and kudos!
Its soo amazing seeing Linus as he says on "Real TV"
Thank you for the great content!
Geez, Linus! De-caf, my man. De-caf!
Linus is why this video did well.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
OUR BOY LINUS MADE IT 🥳🥳🥳
Jimmy not completely faking that he gets the glasses before realising he didnt see the virtual screen yet
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Im glad for you linus. Greetings from Croatia
Bad bunny playing baldurs gate 3 was not something i expected to see in 2025
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Difference between scripted and unscripted Linus   You can tell that this is new for him
You go Linus
Jimmy got flashbacks of Nicole 🎮🎮
I love Linus so much, he on late night television, still ripping socks, and sandals hell yeah brother! Stay you!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Tech YouTubers on late night shows. What a time to be alive!
Wow, traditional tv really sucks!
La situación en Venezuela no se trata solo de un conflicto interno; hay intereses externos que buscan desestabilizar la región. Estados Unidos ha jugado un papel clave en la presión económica y política contra el país, utilizando sanciones y apoyo a sectores opositores para promover sus propios intereses estratégicos. Esto no es nuevo, ya que históricamente ha intervenido en América Latina bajo el pretexto de promover la democracia, cuando en realidad busca control geopolítico. Decimos NO a la guerra y pedimos soluciones pacíficas que respeten la soberanía de los pueblos
Finally steping up with the guests
1 million views🎉🎉🎉
I can’t believe Jimmy Fallon finally made it, congrats on interviewing Linus!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Amazing content as always!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
He said Linus' tech tips. Made it sound so old timey lol
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Should've worn the rgb fur
Linus ist the best!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Finally Small Linus makes the Big Time
His voice is so excited!
Is like see your little brother making it on National TV
And Linus didn't drop anything, good job! 😅
Wow, no plug for the LTT backpack or the LTT store. Linus, dude you missed out. Also strange not to have a segue....... to his sponsors.....
I hope they make it a normal segment so the normies can enjoy Tech too.
Linus is losing his shit
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Im so happy to see this guy on national TV
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Haters: "Linus changed after he got rich."  Linus: Wears socks and sandals with an LTT hoodie for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
This was super helpful, thanks!
YAAAAAY LINUS!
Linus x Jimmy x Bad Bunny tfff??
> 1M views in less than 24 hours far surpasses any other recent guest. Linus fans showing up.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
Who the hell is bad bunny? Thats a guy, right?
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
That wink Linus did after saying "waifu." And the awkward question from Jimmy: "waifu?"
So sick to see Linus on TV 🤯🤯
LGR Time😅❤️
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
You explained this so well, thank you!
Oops sounds like someone starting losing his voice from all the CES excitement.
Linus nervous as a M**********r!!! lol
I was smiling all the time this video was playing.. Watching Linus on Jimmy's show is just amazing and made me happy
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Great job, this video was very useful!
Why not do a monthly new tech segment with Linus on the Tonight Show ?
Amazing content as always!
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Can’t believe this happened
The GOAT himself
Size matters.  That is why i am only here to see Linus.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Thank you for the great content!
Linus being on Jimmy Fallon was NOT on my 2025 bingo card
Need more linus
linus explaining what a waifu is to jimmy fallon was not on my 2025 bingo card
I never imagined seeing Linus and bad bunny in the same video 😂😂
Luke will be jealous.😂
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Jimmy trying to make his show relevant again, sublime 😂
linus is a legend we love u
You could tell Jimmy was unsure about having Linus on... But once he sees that this is getting more views than basically all of his other recent guests, something tells me he's going to have more nerd-focused internet creators on.
All that stuff should be big 8n the years to come
LTT is on Late Night TV!
Congratulations Linus I have always loved your Channel.
Loved the content, keep it coming!
in true PR fashion bunny nips the shades HAHAA dead
The Wan show Will going to be crazy this week.
So cool to see Linus on national TV!!! Love that guy!!!
Nice of Linus to support a smaller creator
Linus is giving me Henry Rollins from 2006 energy.
Linus In TV Shows Ltt is slowly becoming popular among people.😅🎉
Those glasses that change shades remind me of Total Recall when the secretary used a pen to change the color of her fingernails.
How dare he ? bad bunny better apologise, imma send him dk pics otherwise.
This was super helpful, thanks!
Linus did fantastic! Beat Fallon at his own game. Congrats my man!
Amazed he didn’t drop anything, well done Linus! ❤️
Linus on real TV!!!
Who's here to see Linus wearing makeup? Haha
I talked too much in WAN show chat room and missed some stuff. The 12 of us who had the same idea to tune into the floatplane chat  where having a good time.
Congrats for Linus, but what kind of pathetic attempt is this to connect legacy media with the younger generations? 😂  *It's a shame that legacy media is being so stubborn. But it's just like any other industry; those with all the power cannot stand to lose it to any newcomers. Politicians included.*
Bring Austin evans
Bad bunny casually stealing Glasses on live TV 😂
*Bad Bunny=bad diddy*
Wow, I did not expect to see him so nervous/excited. I have to say this was one of the better moments I’ve seen come out of television in quite a while.
Good Job Linus
My favorite tech guy and my favorite musician on my least liked late night talk show!
Once he started talking tech he turned into rabbit on cocaine that is fucking lol
Hi Linus, you looked very nervous, I've been watching you since the beginning but didn't realise it was 20 years ago. 😊
3:00 That's the moment Linus locks back in.
Hahahah Linus looks as excited as a kid in a candy store, hahah happy to see him that way
Sandals and socks ✅ nice to see the guy doesn’t change 😂
If only linus could see himself right now, still giving us amazing tech tips. And to Jimmy fallon and Bad bunny!
Love you, Linus!
this is historical! enjoy Linus, 16 years following you and see you here is really breathtaking
If luck was a person. He even have an Asian wife.
Please get this man back on at some point. Make a tech segment once or twice a year. Such cool tech. Those sunglasses were cool. Hopefully Linus got both pairs back lol
What in the alternate reality is this, crazy stuff, great to see Linus getting the recognition he deserves.
I never thought id see this in my life, linus with Jimmy Fallon and bad bunny.
Still in socks & sandals 😅😅😅
Linus been watching you since day one.  Happy you got on jimmy fallon.  I would have acted just as nervous and you’re literally the GOAT when it came down to tech talk.   Even threw your jokes in there naturally.  GOAT
poor linus is so stressed :(
linus is literally shaking.
*Laptop making screen bigger* Benito:😐  *sunglasses change colors* Benito:🤯  *Glasses with screen* Benito: Déjame veeeel!!!😠
This is kind of unreal. I hope they invite him back to show off more stuff in the future.
Wow, I did not expect to see him so nervous/excited
This was super helpful, thanks!
Jimmy so fucking boring
Did he give another fake review?
Bring him back to show what other stuff he's got in his backpack!
Linus shat all of himself and then locked in
Cant believe this guy got so famous that he gets invited in tv...mind blowing
Great job, this video was very useful!
My favorite bit is Linus just waving Jimmy off with “You don’t need to worry about that”. The audience was 100% on board at that moment
It's funny seeing Linus explain what a Waifu is to Jimmy lmao
Linus is so excited, I love this!
I love seeing how much pretty much every Canadian prefers America over Canada. Obviously not if you just take them to the city and suburbs, but if you bring them to the country and since I'm an sot I can help them shoot a mschine gun their first time and that's when they realize how badly they're missing out in one thing which makes them wonder about other things... its not far from us but they Definitely have some weird laws or whatever they call them legally there lol.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Those nerves are real bro!!!
These people don’t deserve your nerves   Linus. Why did they ask you to come on?  They need you, and other internet celebrities to bring the show validation.  It was you validating them not the other way around.
Can't wait for the next WAN Show!
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
I never thought I’d see Linus and Bad Bunny in the same room hahahahahah
Mr. Tech Tips did well! Nice to see him on the show!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
You explained this so well, thank you!
that rolling screen laptop is going to be a repair technicians nightmare
I know Linus but I have no idea who Bad Bunny is... lmao..
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
this is so deeply weird
Finally. A real celebrity!
Despite all of the stupid overblown controversies... WE STILL MADE IT BOYS LFGGGG
it legit took me a whole minute of carefully observing linus to see whether this was real or AI...or just adhd mixed with nervousness in its purest form. So cool to see him here
You explained this so well, thank you!
Just like to note how the video with Linus name in the title is CRUSHING the one with Bad Bunny. Linus is gonna be on cloud 9.
I'm still trying to process what I just witnessed
Who's here because they watch LTT?
Linus is like the tech version of when they bring out the animal guy when a guest cancels, lol. Unprofessional, not really a celeb, excited to be there, has cool shit to show you.
Great job, this video was very useful!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Jimmy Fallon acting like he doesn't know the term waifu
Never expected this, so random😂
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Honestly, Fallon could have had an entire Linus special and not run out of things to be amazed at.
Sure sounds like @LinusTechTips should have an annual CES show visit to show off the latest techs on The Tonight show.
Could Tell @LinusTechTips  was nervos haha but amazing to see him there
Linus explaining a waifu.... 2025.... we starting strong LMAO! now a Segue.... to our sponsor!
GIVE LINUS HIS OWN SEGMENT ONCE A WEEK! No, my capslock is not broken.
🫡❤️
its obvious how nervous he is which is so surprising compared to when u see him in the tech world like a king
Was not expecting to see Linus and Jimmy Fallon collab hahaha
ayyyyyyyyyyyy linus on tv woooooooooo😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Linus forgot about the Glasses he lent Bad Bunny. lolz
Congratulations Linus 🎊 👏 💐 😊
isnt this the guy that made the video with disgraced youtuber twomad
Great job, this video was very useful!
linus explaining what a waifu is was hilarious!
Linus sounds like he speaks in 1.5x speed 😂
Fake!!  Linus didn't drop anything!  Seriously though; this was great.
Amazing content as always!
L takes
I think they need to consider giving @LinusTechTips a permanent segment on the show to stay relevant. What isn't connected to the internet anymore? Millennials and younger generations want more of this (if they even watch TV anymore), or the show is going to die with the boomers and network television. Linus has the knowledge and charisma to bring some industry news and make people laugh. He's a perfect fit. Shook the nerves in 2 minutes. I bet he could do the show justice.
Haha, 14 hrs into the video dropping and almost 10x views as Bad Bunny, whom I had to look up.
Loved the content, keep it coming!
is linus wearing makeup?
I am shocked SHOCKED that Linus didn't take the opportunity to shill his LTT backpack while he was there. It's a very good backpack.
LINUS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Bad Bunny as musician is a really good talk show host.
This was super helpful, thanks!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
You done great Linus!
Honestly, Bad Bunny seemed to be having a great time with this and really dug all the tech. I don't know them or their work too well, but seemed pretty chill
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Bad bunny getting impatient was my favorite part 😂
Very well done, appreciate this video!
🔥dope
as nerd myself, this is the dopest Jimmy interview ive ever watched. this made me happy
This man is literally living the dream. Congrats, LS. Still wish you would have RAPVed to my wedding lol.
so many worlds colliding 🤯
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Letttts good! In slightly Canadian accent.
he seems so genuinely excited, I love that
Bunny's busted
Jimmy: that's a laptop. unimpressed.jpg Linus: juvenile dick jokes  Yup, this went just like I expected
It feels cool to understand some of the things he's talking about while Jimmy's wondering what in the world is coming out of Linus's mouth.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
10/10 Sandals & all. I'd love to see Guga on next
LOL
Amazing content as always!
Wait what?
Linus, Jimmy, and Bad Bunny. Wtf
Linus, you absolute pro! You rocked it. Loved your backpack 😂
Would love to see him back for more tech segments!! It was funny seeing him use terms like doom scroll and waifu forgetting that the people there actually touch grass
This is epic. I was at ces too!
Although he was shaking at 2:50 crazy to see how fast he was able to adjust, keep his cool and not shake anymore by 5:12   I would be shaking before and after this interview if I were Linus. Congratulations!
Ellen DeGeneres on Jimmy Fallon? Big deal.
You can tell he is honored, super happy and stressed : ) the haircut tho : ) BTW now it's time for Jayztwocents : ) and Steve!!!
Props to the Tonight Show makeup artist & stylist!
His hand shaking so much when putting the pen back in to the mug
Benito better use those glasses on a video. 😊
laptop is exactly what i was looking for
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Was he wearing his slippers?
That Linus guy is a real natural!
3:09 it's called the LTT commuter bag. Get your fact straight Jimmy. JK 😂
I feel like even though Linus was nervous, they did not even try to care. That's why it looks a bit cringe
linuss !!
Hell yeah, Linus! Smart move having Bad Bunny try the shades first, he pulls them off astonishingly well 😂
Wait, what ?!?!?! Is this bizarro world ?
Was not expecting Linus to chill with bad bunny and jimmy Fallon 😂
Linus did a great job
Where is unrated version where he drops something?
Bad Bunny looks like he is DEFINITELY going to buy those glasses! 🤣🤣
YEAAAAAHHHHHHH LINUS!!!!! HE'S EXCITED AGAIN!!! I KNOW THIS JUICED HIM UP!!
WTF!! Linus come on why on this SHIT SHOW!!!!
I'm glad they gave him a decent spot on the show, so many times you will get a moment like this and it winds up being just four or five minutes. He could have gone longer but it's great that they gave him as much time as they did
Idk why... but I'm so proud
Linus and Jimmy together, a whole new reason to hate Jimmy Fallon. What a joke.
OMG...Love this!!
Thats not badbunny.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
I didn't think this was real because was so nervous and he always seems calm. 🤣
Shout out LTT backpack placement
Loved the content, keep it coming!
This is the most random interview ever, as a long time Linus fan its crazy seing him with Bad Bunny and Jimmy, The Multiverse is real.
THIS IS ICONIC!!!! Love to see it!!
And here I always thought his last name was Tech Tips
I'm a little disappointed this was more of a product showcase instead of getting to know the unique story of an edutainment creator starting as an employee making youtube videos when that wasn't really a thing yet, buying his own channel, and now running a media company with ~100 employees.
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
This has to be the strangest, most bizarre crossover in history, so proud of Linus tho, been watching him since the NCIX days.
This was great!! He should have Linus on again and he and Linus should put a computer together inside 10 minutes. I bet that would be great to see.
Linus sex tips
If that host Fallon need a co-host this show is trully dying. Fair play for Linus tho making it to the mainstream altho “trashy” media 🎉
What the hell
I knew he wanted them glasses lmbo
LINUS, YOU NEEERRRDDD
do the GTA VI comment
Damn, we writing History! :D
LINUS EXPLAIING WHAT A WAIFU IS TO JIMMY FALLON IS FUCKING HYSTERICAL.
The nerves were there at first but as soon as the segment truly got going he was in his stride. Hopefully a second appearance with more tech and him feeling more comfortable would do both him and the show wonders!
Wow , Jimmy you don’t let BB talk 😂😂😂
we all were waiting for limus to break one of thoose things dont come here to tell me otherwise
Thank you for the great content!
Yay Linus!!! Love their channel!!!
You know it's a big deal when Linus combs his hair 🤣
Linus kinda looks like he did coke but cute to see him a bit nervous haha. Love him, have been watching since I was 12, almost 10 years
This was very informative, appreciate it.
can tell he is a bit nervous but i think everyone would be also we are all proud of you Linus well done mate!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
With bad bunny is also crazy 😂
Even seeing that this is on the official channel, it took a minute for me to be sure it was real.
Bro ligit wore sandals and socks here too 🤦‍♂
1 Million in 14 hours? Linus is major
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
That was so freaking awesome.
He was in such a flap, I expected him to start jumping on the couch and proclaiming his love for Katie Holmes....!!
linus is on jimmy kimmel now wtf...
Jimmy Fallon not knowing what waifu means turned this from ok into gold.
I love how like half the video was Linus Sex Tips
Wow, two of my worlds come together
This was very informative, appreciate it.
This is so surreal. He's so nervous, but gosh man its cool to see.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
LTT in the tonight show is legendary
Linus and bad bunny in the same video was not on my list for 2025 lmaoo
We gonna see Bad Bunny at his next show rockin' some cool new shades.
This is the very last thing I would have expected to happen in 2025
This guy must really be desperate if he needs to be on awful show, with fake laugh Fallon, to promote himself.
I do believe Bad Bunny just got away with taking those glasses and I don't blame him. they looked good on him and with the color changing lens they all looked good it was kinda crazy. even jimmy looked good
He's so nervous and he's shaking 😂😂😂😂😂
Damn Linus had alot of nervous energy, but well done.
Interesting how YouTube personalities just can't shut off that YouTube personality.
WHAT
I really want to know how this came about.
I'm disappointed that this didn't end with a segway to our sponsor.
we got linus on jimmy fallon before gta6
I would like to see Linus come back next year with the newest CES gadgets
Bros so excited
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
That was amazing. Been a while since I've seen Linus so nervous and excited and as soon as the tech comes out and he gets to show that off, he's in his element again 😊
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
GREAT JOB, Linus! Even nailed the "size" joke. Nervous, but you got there. Do I think your Channel is perfect? No, we know there are issues with the amount of material pumped out, fact-checking etc.. But, Linus has worked very HARD for a long time and deserves this.
What
I love how all the commenters here are LTT fans. You did a great job.
only linus could make jimmy fallon seem timmid
Oh hell yeah Linus!! Playing with big boys, blowing their minds!
Linus looks like he took speed before walking on stage, so nervous. Who wouldn'tbe? "A few more inchs wouldbe nice" Cracked me up. 👍. 😂
Whaaaa Linus has slicked back his hairrrrr and I've never seen him so nervous ❤  so glad to see a fellow Vancouverite so floored 😂😂😊
NGL I fully expected him to face the camera and say something like "and now the segue... to our sponsor!"
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Absolutely killed it Linus congrats!
Holy fuck what
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Yoo Linus lol
Being a fan of linus for years its weord seeing him genuinly nervous just by how he is answering
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Linus could have been on Air sales person. Like shopping Network.
Thank you for the great content!
Linus is all grown up now. I'm so proud. 'Cries in Tech'
This is surreal!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Where is shaggy Linus now? Proud of you Linus!
Its the nerd joins the cool kids club moment
Tonight i click the 3 white dots "Don't recommend this channel".
Is it just me is Linus like really really nervous at the start like I can here how shaky his voice is
Amazing content as always!
I was waiting for the sergeant to this sponsor
those Xreal glasses are definitely gonna sell out now lol I have the Viture Pros which are similar and it's pretty amazing tech, most people don't know it exists yet tho lol
Great job, this video was very useful!
hmm. Linus looks annoying on real tv.. say's his aunt
Coming on post-beard is a disaster smh
I'm  surprised he's on the show. It's usually actors and musicians on the show.
Its nice having a tech youtuber on jimmy fallon. Reminders me of when Josh Topolsky from the verge used to come on.
Tonight I discovered Jimmy Fallon because of Linus
I'm sorry, why did NO ONE TELL ME LINUS WENT ON THE TONIGHT SHOW
“Spiderman( Toby McGuire) crying meme” watching your boy make it to late night❤
this is a group of ppl I never would have imagined would be together 😭 fun interview tho!
Linus congratulations 😭😭
The makeup department really made him more feminine lol
Been watching homie since 2010. What a stud.
You can TELL Linus' feet were not touching the floor 😭😭😭
Since when does Linus get on the tonight show? Has he made it?
terrible
That backpack is awesome, where I can buy one?
Crazy to see Linus here. You did an amazing Job Linus! Bringing excitement to the tech world to another demographic!
Why are you sharing a desk. Not a good look
He loves socks and Teva sandals 😂
Who is Linus Sebastian? This is Linus Sex Tips
Es la primera vez que veo a Linus tan nervioso jajaja me encanta verlo fuera de su Ambiente Natural Gracias Linus por todos tu videos =)
I actually have the display glass there really cool
NGL when he mentioned the backpack I thought he was going to do an ltt backpack plug
Way to go Linus!
Why did you waste your time interviewing  techtubes biggest shill?
Linus nervous is crazy to me
Congrats Linus!!
I've never seen him so nervous lol
nice work linus
Need more LTT segments. Having someone who actually knows tech was great.
I love Linus
Please make this a reoccurring segment!
he is so nervous ! jeeezzzzz
very cool
how you can do that ! ,,dont worry about it '' :)))))
Linus impressing Bad Bunny is easily one of his biggest wins
Not even a word about backpack😢
We got nervous  linus before gta 6
My boy global!
I think as soon as Linus got to make the “few more inches” joke the nerves finally resided
Lil bro doing side quests
Linus was shaking because he wanted so badly to mention LTT store when he reached over to his backpack ;)
This is amazing!!!! Love Linus and LTT!!!
It's so funny watching Linus go from a genuine Tech dude to another corporate shill and trying to join the oligarchy. When they hired on a corporate oligarch to run the channel, it stopped being the legitimate PC channel I enjoyed watching a decade ago, but their content was already becoming shilly about five years ago. This feels like him going overboard after the LTT sexual harassment accusations that they never actually denied, followed by LTT calling one of their former allies "inaccurate" or sub-par in their methodology while they themselves were publishing blazingly dishonest or inaccurate PC part information. I un-sub'd from LTT two years ago and still have no regrets.
Seeing Linus on a late night tv show with bad bunny as co-host wasn’t on my 2025 bingo card.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE LINUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS in the mainstream WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the road to your fame has a lot of ups and downs. regardless of what people say about linus, he's constantly learning. even to improve himself. the fruits of his labor are now here on actual TV. keep learning linus!
.. Im safe here. .. sagways cant hurt me . :,U
congratulations linus
LTT on Jimmy Fallon is crazy... Never saw this coming. Great stuff
Poor linus is so excited and nervous this was too cute😭
This confirms that a certain white powder is issued before interview 😁 - love you LTT, fan since NCix days. xoxo
this is really smart from NBC. don't bring on youtubers to talk about YouTube. Middle America does not give a shit. have people with passion, like Linus, who can serve as a true guest, enlightening the host to topics they're unfamiliar with. Very akin to the old animal handler bits that used to be common on late night. Just introduce new things for the host to react to, and play off of. this was well done, and the best YouTube segment I've seen on late night in a long time.
So happy to see a cool Canadian on the Tonight Show. Go Linus!
Who thought it was a good idea to put Linus in this position 😂
Never thought we would see our favorite, wound up Canadian on national Television.  Congrats, Linus!
Honestly I think the show and the audience would benefit from more Linus. Once he gets comfortable, his ability to educate and distill information down to a digestible level is bar none. Would love to see him back!
que cosa tan mas rara, pero me encanto!
🥲🥲🥲🥲
Yo Linus!
me.. who the f is bad bunny haha.. Probably while Linus in a Room full of people who thinks, who the F is Linus Sebastian Xd
😭😭😭😭the cross over I not thought possible
Que hace bad bunny ahí
Why is linus  answering like  a chatgpt answer?
Oh no....Linus revealed the secrets of our ways! Flee! Run to the mountains! Protect our waifus!! The wrath from the Capital will be upon us!!!
Linus blowing up!!!!!!!
Legend has it Bad Bunny still has those glasses
Linus was pretty sweet and on point here. Really nervous and still keen on talking about what he loves.
Beautiful to see Linus here. Amazing.
Note: 2025 the start of the annual LTT visit at this show! Same Linus, different socks.
Linus killed it, I’m gonna start watching his shows more I might consider trying out floatplane
lol Linus is so nervious
W Jimmy
Linus brings all the nerds to yard.
god what a tool...
Hearing "Diablo" from Bad Bunny is an achievement, that man switched back to Spanish because of the shock lmao.
Jimmy: "did you smuggle some stuff from CES?" Linus: "I did smuggle this segue, to our sponsor!"
Linus 👌👌👌🎉
did Linus wear makeup? really? lol
I'm so glad Jimmy Fallon cared enough to call it "Linus's Tech Tips" instead of "Linus Tech Tips."
Jimmy Fallon learning about Waifus….  … oh yeah, this is gonna be a great 2025. 🎉
Linus is the best.
Well that was surprising.
It's Linus! So Jimmy gets a free 👍
Finally a small youtuber who gets carried by Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny. <3
What the heck???? Is this AI? Linus on boomer TV??
That was a great watch! This jimmy guy and his sidekick should collab with Linus.
This is a killer mix 🎉
I literally tought this was a LTT video making a parody or something but this is so cool.
"linus's tech tips are on YouTube right now"... Linus's what is on where???
love to see Linus on mainstream TV. And he did great! He really connected with Bad Bunny and Jimmy. Kudos to the producer of the show for bringing him in.
What a champ, good job Linus!
This is a fever dream I never thought in a million years that Linus would be on one of Americas biggest talk shows
Its weird seeing Linus on TV. And when did jimmy get a boyfriend
Linus is the Steve Irwin of tech we never knew we needed!
That's ma boy LInus
The third tech device is what we need now in handheld gaming era. Let me know the brand, model and price of this tech glasses.
This is awesome
They should have Linus on every year after CES. Maybe they can even film a second segment with some of the wackiest gadgets from CES.
Linus did great, it's rare that you see him nervous like this but it reminds you that he's just a nerd like the rest of us!
NGL pretty cool backpack 👀
Stole the show 🎉🎉❤❤
Kinda disappointed he didn't segway to a sponsor lol
Some boomer producer at 70 years old finally talked to their nephew about what people they like on the computer.  Linus is so humble, even though these people are beneath him in any way or medium, he's still excited to be there.
linus is a sellout
Amazing to see Linus out of his element! Not once did he segue to a sponsor!
Gamers nexus steve gonna drop a video about Linus being in with Lenovo now haha.
Boy howdy is Jimmy's energy as bad as ever
That is a nice backpack, I wish you told everyone where you got it from😀
Cute.
Got to see my fave artist and fave techtuber together geeking out before gta 6
Linus was wonderful, make bring him in to show off crazy tech every once and a while it was fun
Have him on once a week to show us new tech please!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Oh I know it’s big
Hey, Lae'zel on national television.
the muted "diablo cabron" at 7:40 is so fucking funny
hell yeah!
This is like a black mirror episode lol
Seeing bad bunny and Linus in one screen was definitely not in my bingo card for sure
Technology is going wild ❤
Huh I never really thought about it but Linus is the reason I became an IT engineer. All started with me building my first PC and realizing I could do this shit
That was awesome Linus!! You did great!! Love your videos and Merch. Keep up the good work!
I like how none of the cool tech he shows has AI shoved in. Legit cool tech. Nice one, Linus.
I thought he did super good. Dont listen to reddit Linus
Seing Linus get the recognition he deserves is great to see
killed it Linus! way to go man 🇨🇦
I Never Knew that Linus was on TV!
Can't believe this is the same guy who casually dropped hard R's
Ain’t no fucking way
Lenovo offices watching their product get WOW reactions on TV:  * glazed *
linus only became popular thanks to viewer and subscriber bots....
Amazing segment!
Duuuude I can't believe you made it to Fallon man!!! You should have asked for more cow bell 😂😂
Linus appearance = 900k views and counting! Lfgggg
That was cool to see Linus on Fallon!
Holy shit seeing him nervous is so cute
He should have taken a xanax
So many questionable and easily misconstrued comments. It's great!
Jimmy is only tv host other than conan i feel whos honnest to himself and everybody specialaly with linus when reggie and shiguro the  mario createor( i cant spell his name ) , he seems genuinely  interested and excited  im happy we have jimmy .
Those who are eager to know more at next WAN show 😂
LINUS DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Linus was on speed?
So... Who is Bad Bunny?
We got linus techtips on jimmy fallon before gta6
I don't think I've ever seen Linus nervous before 😅
Late Night Tips
Look at out small big boy!! hahaha i have never see him so nervous since the old NCIX videos ! He normally looks so comfortable in any kind of youtube recording setting, videos, podcasts, conferences but i guess tv with an actual public must be a very different beast, also knowing you have to talk to normies instead of your typical pcmaster race and tech enthusiast member.
So FREAKING AWESOME!
I am sorry why is Bad Bunny there? Cant stand this guy. Linus though love him! So cool to see him on "real TV" haha.
2 titanes se conocen
ain't no fucking Way!!!!!!!!
I just couldn't handle the temptation of "the segue to our sponsor" it never came :(
Nervy ahh
Hahahaha how excited Linus actually is, he can't even breath 😅
Jimmy Fallon is higher then a kite
So cool to see Linus on here.
Linus was just a ces ad
I tought I would never see these people together in my live bro
fun fact: who tf are bad bunny or jimmy fallon. linus tech tips is a real STAR
Nervous Linus but man he pulled it together pretty quick lol. Not bad.  Should have showed some kind of 1sr person view from the glasses tho with the audience in the background
Linus Killed it. Dude is a natural tv personality knowing when to allow a reaction and when to rush them along to keep it interesting.
Good for Linus, he did pretty well for his first time on Late Night Tele.
Stoked to see Linus featured on the tonight show. I have been watching his shows for eleven years.
linus, the king of sexual harassment in tech
linus and bad bunny in the same room together is a fever dream
This should be a yearly thing after CES
“don’t worry too much about it!” Lmfao!
This needs to be turned into a segment of the show
Linus' Tech Tips
This is crazy never in my wildest dreams did i think this would happen. Holy crap linus geeking out.
Gotta love LTT and Linus Sebastian
Fires all his staff, scams people with honey and look at him go
He should off put the "I run arch btw" Sweater
Amazing Job Linus! Big geek energy!!
You can tell they were ready to start teasing him, but then Linus Sebastian came out and he took over.
I love to see Linus so excited like this!
Nervous for no reason. His videos get more viewers than the Tonight Show.
lol this is Linus in true form, no goofy segues, no "infotainment", just his goofy ass being excited about tech
Lol why did they bother screen capping the steam deck lol
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6.
#4 on youtube trending today. Wild! You guys did great.
Seriously good.
where was the "SEGUE TO OUR SPONSOR"
Holy moly he's nervous. Happy to see you getting out there Linus!
6:08 lmao “don’t worry about it” 😂
I never thought I'd see this. My favourite youtube celebrity with my favourite TV host, awesome. I would've love this segment to be longer.
this weeks wan show will be good
Man, Bad bunny looks different from what i expected ngl. I only watched this because of MY BOY LINUS LETS GOOOOOOOOOO CONGRACTS MY DUDE! Cant wait for this weeks wanshow!
2 mayor points about this. 1. Kuddos to Jimmy cause Linus was hiper nervous like crazy nervous and with the first question he made him feel comfortable. 2. I know is a bit but.... socks and sandals? xD Beside that congratz LTT!!!! this was amazing now take me to the segway to our sponsor!
Bunny was genuinely speechless after seeing that huge screen with the glasses. Bro couldn't comprehend
Nunca pensé ver a jimmy, bad bunny y Linus juntos JAJSJj
Linus gets on real TV
Never would have thought seeing Linus Sebastian and Bad Bunny on a Late Night Show. Is this a bug in the matrix?
Can’t wait to see that sunglasses tech get used for ODST visors
I was waiting for the LTT store plug😂
I paused so Linus could breathe.  Bro, you're worth almost as much as the show, calm down 😂
Way to go linus
It's cute because your nervous
Its amazing, that after this many years, Linus is terrified in front of people
Dude this is so awesome I’ve been watching this guy since I was in high school
So proud of our Linus!
Nice drop. What, he didn't drop !!
We used to have "animal" segments on the late shows. Bring that concept back, but have "tech" segments with Linus instead!
NO WAY
The only show with Linux where i miss his damned Segue...
Holy shit normal people have no idea what internet culture is
The shaking at 2:50 when he puts the pen back. Quite nice to see even someone as seasoned as Linus can get nervous in front of a camera
Thanks for the clarification.  Had signed up for wifu classes thinking it was some new martial art—not marital aid.
His hair and makeup!!
who the hell is Bad Bunny? lol legit I have no idea who that is. And Jimmy is trash these days so Linus is the star up there imo.
Linus seemed very hype about being on tv
LINUS?!??
god late night is so fucking bad
The nerds time to shine !!!! We made it boys !
this does not feel real bro
Vancouver represent!
Huge Linus!
Wasn't expecting to see Linus with Bad Bunny at all hahaha amazing
We get these likes up,you know they'll bring him back for segments
who are those guys in suits next to Linus??😂
This was brutal, it's like Linus speaking to cavemen. All the witty tech jokes/jargon going over everyone's head.
Linus is the real deal. Been watching everything by him since i was a kid
Jimmy should go on LTT.
Linus turned into corpo rat. All of sudden he thinks he is a star. No wonder that none of his colleagues(tech reviewers) wants to talk with him anymore. No support for Kyle/Bitwit for loosing his home in fires.
Probably the first time Wifeu has been talked about on Jimmy’s show 🤣
bro what i thought this was an edit
who is the guy interviewing Linus?
I recall a member of the Linus team who wasn’t particularly fond of xreal (nreal) glasses in their review. Look how tables have turned.
I don't know if it's nervousness, this is just American TV, it looks like they told him to sound extra nerdy and screechy, be very excited... Or like they made him take some coke before going on.
Linus did a great job i know how discomforting it can be be on live tv
Funny thing is, YouTube and its creators are bigger than traditional TV 😂🤷‍♂️ I don’t get why Linus is nervous, Jimmy must be nervous and excited 🙃
Linus and bad Bunny 😭 wtf
Linus is now a real celebrity
I would like this to be a reoccurring segment.
Yup cringe, at least i watched 20 seconds lol
We got Linus on The tonight show before GTA 6
Lol, Linus segment has over 4x the views as Bad Bunnys, congrats for being the king Linus.
This was amazing!  ... This comment will continue after this segue to our sponsor [insert_sponsor_here_whichwillprobablybeDBrandanyway]! ...  I've been a viewer since it was only Linus and then Linus and Luke alternating between what each of them covered.  All of their videos was just them. Then when the rest of the crew came along they organized a "roast" some time after and it was also amazing. From there I was introduced to J2C and Tech Jesus.  Soooo many memories from the LTT channel alone. So many years too. Such a long journey. I'm so happy for Linus as a person, and also very happy for the whole LMG. Well deserved!  I'd say "god only knows how much time Linus spent working" but god doesn't have a clue. We have to ask Ivone for precise timing or Linus' current bf, which isn't Jake anymore and I'm still sad about it!
Omg never saw this coming 🤞🏼
Aww im sad linus didn't bring the ces waifus
I love this guy and his energy
Bro looks different with makeup
The reason why I got jimmy fallon in my feed
That nervous guy looks like he knows a lot about tech. I'm sure he'll make a good tech YouTuber one day.
I'd like to see this as a regular segment
Does anyone know what backpack that is? 😏
W Linus
the moment he realized hes bad bunny and doesnt have to give them back lmao
nice to see Linus helping small creators
I love this for Linus so much I'm as giddy as he is to see him on the big screen 😊
ive never seen my guy that nervous 😂😂😂
congrats Linus!
Linus killed it! Please we need more of this guy on mainstream media.
I do believe Linus got star struck
i was here. monumental
This is the craziest link up I have seen, possibly in my whole life.
When Worlds Collide.
Watching Linus on "real tv" but I am still watching it on YouTube... lol
This felt other worldly to watch!!! Linus and Bad Bunny - As a Puertorican computer nerd and Bad Bunny fan, I did a double take when I saw the thumbnail!
Just breathe
Dang linus didnt drop anything.... he's learning.... oh god😅😅😅
Linus Tech Tips + Bad Bunny + Jimmy Fallon in one interview was never something I could’ve predicted
He should be a regular on the show to show us crazy new tech. Like a yearly CES highlight. He’s only going to get better at being on tv 😎. Make him the Neil Tyson of explaining tech to us.
This feel fake idk why
The excitement of seeing Linus on primetime TV feels like watching a family member.
Wait, where's the segway to our sponsor?
Linus could be the equivalent of Jim Fowler bringing animals on Johnny Carson.
Stoked to find this!
Now you got to give him a show "Pimp my Tech"!
HOLY SHIT. MY BOI MADE IT
Why the hell was he on the show? Did hollywood run out of celebrities to market that they now have to turn to youtubers?
Wtf did I just watch 🤣 Jokes aside, I love these guys, not sure who Bad Bunny is though.
Linus was on grown up tv!!!!!!
Linus trying to explain what waifu is on a real tv show is the peak :)
Linus did a great job
trash
Lmao wth
This is a good idea for a reoccurring segment.
😎
Jimmy needs to get Linus on more often. He was super nervous at the start.
The least expected crossover ever
Linus handshaking bad bunny is something I would have never expected in my life
he feels soo hype and out of place like not in a horrible way but maybe its just cause i m soo used to seeing chill linus on wan plus like do people he is hosting with even understand words like oled or display resolutions well gotta wait till friday to see how linus found the whole experience.     yes i know Linus will read thru all of these comments  so take care buddy and thank you existing
Linus deserves this spotlight he's a decent guy
Nervous linus Lesssgoooooo
The amount of dick jokes Linus brings to the show lmao
What a random thing
When you take this guy out of tech he looks so cringe and dumbo :D
Linus being down to earth nervous in this is why he’s such a great creator and probably a great boss, man is the salt of the earth kinda bloke
Seeing him a little nervous in the beginning was so funny but he immediately changes when it’s all about tech. So happy for him he deserves it.
I dont watch Fallon  But i like Linus, and he mellows Fallon out well
Clearly, some Linus fans work at the tonight show. I thought this was a bit, and he just green greened himself on and was going to use a Jimmy Fallon AI and make some stupid segue to our sponsor.
Damn ... Linus on Tonight Show ?!? That's one of the things i've never thought i'd see in my life.
So happy to see my favorite tech YouTuber broaden his reach by getting on this show. What an accomplishment!
Anyone bothered by Linus's hair style on this segment? It's too clean cut and quite off putting.
que monda esta colaboracion XDDDDDDDD what the fuck is this colaboration
He’s so nercious
We need more Linus!
Never seen linus being nervous on camera 😂
Never seen Linus THIS nervous. But that’s how genuine excited being there.
You ever thought a few more inches would be nice? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Linus looks too well groomed
Felt like a proud papa seeing Linus here. 😊
Ltt
Can't believe that Linus became made it to the Tonight show. So happy to see this moment. 🤩🤩
yessss , LTT for the win
This feels as monumental as MKBHD getting recognized in an Apple event
Hell yeah LTT
He's so nervous without his segue to his sponsor
This needs to become a recurring segment!
pos doesnt deserve the attention
OKAY LINUS LETS GO
Where's the segue?
Did that laptop just get excited?
The time has finally come where Linus is actually funny for once 😂
That bunny is pretty much a monkey WTF why is he so retarded?
Omg, I couldn't watch this video in the beginning seeing him that nervous. My anxiety got triggered for some reason.
LINUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Albeit you were pretty stoked and nervous you did amazing!
I had to play at 0.75x 😂.
More Linus!!! He could be your Jeff Musial for Tech!
Linus on Jimmy's show is something I never knew I needed :)
I love how Bad Bunny "secretly" snipes the color changing glasses.
Way to go Linus! I loved seeing him nervous and out of his element for once but he still did great. Don't usually watch Fallon so this was a great way to get me to watch.
I was half-expecting Linus to come out on a Segway, then leave after saying "And now a Segway...to our SPONSOR" -->Cut to Commercial Break
Brilliant to see Linus on here! Been watching him for years.
What! Linus is on the tonight show
WAN Show baby. Also those glasses were straight up Bad Bunny's vibe. That company has to be so thankful to you Linus.
We got Linus on The Tonight Show before GTA6
No shameless plug to his store. Where have the time gone
Can't wait for this week's WAN show
Never in my life did I expect a youtube tech content creator to be on a talk show. Congrats Linus and LMG, that is an impressive feat!
MY WORLDS HAVE COLLIDED!
This is my first time seeing Mr. Fallon and Mr. Bunny.
Linus on TV. Nice.
this is the new version of bringing on an animal expert haha
WHAT THE FUCK
He sounds exactly like how I would sound in the same situation
Seeing Linus be so passionate on Fallon is so amazing, you can tell he's trying to contain himself while nerding out!
Wow!
Linus made it! This is so cool to see!
He was probably more calm on his wedding night...
Damn he was nervous af
I know more about Linus than Bad Bunny
Linus, real TV is youtube these days.
I was nervous that he was gonna bomb like 20 seconds into it, but he saved it by getting back into his area of expertise.  Great job!
I absolutely hate Jimmy Fallon. So I'd probably be less nervous 😂
Pleeeeease have him back on!! This was so interesting and refreshing
Sponsored by Dbrand
We got Linus on Fallon before GTA 6
Sup Noah
He’s making me nervous
already has more views than when Taylor Swift was last on
This is so weird, never thought I'd see Linus here
Did not have Linus explaining waifus to Jimmy Fallon on my bingo card
Linus Sebastian made Waifu mainstream.
Classic, bro still managed to shill a bunch of products. Bet those brands paid big for the advertising knowing the views thatd come from having him on Jimmy Fallon’s show.
THE GLASSES BENITOOOOOO
The biggest segway sponsor ever for those glasses 🤣
The memes are gonna be good 😂
I know that guy lol
loved this. fantastic show
Funny how the Tonight Show is trying to introduce Linus to the world.  LOL Linus has more viewers than the Tonight Show by far.  It would make more sense for Jimmy to go on LTT and get introduced to a larger audience.
My favorite episode to date!!!
God damn it. Sandals and socks on mainstream tv lol
Godamn - he is so nervous!
I think Jimmy and Bad Bunny need some LTT Screwdrivers 😂
FUCK LINUS! HE knew about HONEY and said nothing about it publicly.
This is this weird my tech tube is blending into the "main stream "
Awesome to see tech showing out in the public!
I don't even want those products but Linus made me want them with his energy lol
Missed opportunity here, Jimmy should have done his Nick Burns character
Funny seeing just how stoked Linus was to be there.
The most unfunny tech guy meets the most unfunny comedian.
👨‍💻
Wow Linus made Fallon interesting. Quite the feat.
His last name is TechTips
Why bad bunny?
It’s great that he did not drop any of the devices that he showed 😂😂😂
Linus - "Waifu"  Me - "You lost them at Waifu, Linus." Jimmy - "...Wife?..."
No way we got Linus on Late night😂
Stoked to see a techie on the tonight show! Thank you Linus! We love you!
I wanna watch a cooking video so bad rn
I would have never imagined having Linus tech tips and Bad Bunny in the same room. What a time to be alive :')
Missed opportunity to segue, to your local commercial!
Linus showcasing to a hollywood elite what I've been doing for the past 5 years was not in my bingo cards for today
Holy smokes
Oh Wow , Linus on the Tonight Show , It's true that TV changes how people look :D Thanks Jimmy and Bad Bunny for inviting Linus , it was interesting to see Linus out of is confort zone 😁
linus makes more viewers than Jimmy or any late night hosts right now anyways
Well, at least they didn't call him "Linus Tech Tips"
Who or why is this Bad Bunny character? Couldn’t Jimmy handle the interview on his own?
shoutout Linus
The one pro DOES have a chip. That's their selling point that it's the only one in the market that has one on board and doesn't need a special device to do the processing for the spacial computing for the display
Where is the sponsor?
this is the most surreal crossover ive ever seen
On one hand, Linus. On the other Jimmy Fallon and legacy media. Should I watch this?
❤😮😊
my mind is 🤯 as my worlds collide!
this feels like an interdimensional crossover lmao
Brought to you by Honey.
This is a win for everyone who works in the Tech and Computer industry.. Congrats Linus.
Hollyshit❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
DEJAME VEL JAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJA
Never been more proud of our boy, he's on the funny man show
The most unexpected crossover I could have ever imagined
damn this is where it all ends
Bro was beyond nervous but reigned it in I love ot
Linus x Jimmy x Bad Bunny + super cool tech + great jokes = incredible watch
I am in tech partly because of Linus!
Man Linus was SOOO, SOOO excited!  I loved the introduction of the tech that could grow in size like bananas with a tap. Also loved his introduction of wifu to them.
So funny
It is wired to see Linus on TV ngl
That was great.
Linus and tech tips
Seeing Linus on Jimmy wasn't on my 2025 bingo card
This absolute madman goes on live television and drops "Waifu" casually like that. I love you Linus.
Still trying to work out who thinks they have made it now they have, got Linus on... or been on Fallon...
Something I never thought I needed, but so glad I got it
They put so much stage makeup on Linus he looks like a Victorian doll 😂 great presentation through!
Damn Linus has come a LOOOOONG way! Nice work.
We got Linus representing the Weeb culture before GTA 6 Awesome performance, missed the lttstore plug
It's feeling like looking at your childhood friend who has gone popular and has his first appearance on TV.
I’m happy for Linus!
Who tf is “bad bunny”
So nervous at the start he missed the segue... Mad to think how far it's all come from the early days. Fair play guys.
That's so awesome to see Liuns there
the WAN show run by .dll  Dan-k us  Lin-k us  Luk-k us
Who  is Jimmy fallons little bro on the right?
Linus Goodman. He sounds like a great Technical Lawyer
Whaaaat the fuck
Been watching Linus since I was young and got me into pc building, glad to see him finally on the big screen.
it goes exactly as i thought how nerd act when goes into 'real tv' so to speak, and how audience would react..😂 not anything bad, but as expected..😂
How come Jimmy and BadBunny aren't aware of AR glasses. Even Linus is showing them like it's something out of this world
Bring out MKBHD next time
Wow seeing internet culture clash with TV culture is an experience
Linus may be the only person that's ever said waifu on network tv
The crossover I would never even have dreamed of
8 MINS OF ADS
what is linus doing here bro 💀
They need Linus on after every CES
Linus appearing on a late night show was not on my 2025 bingo card
I came for ltt and was not disappointed
Loved seeing this side of Linus.
I love the fact that Jimmy and Bad bunny were a little awestruck at the cool tech that Linus bought.
How to be a singer without sing a word.
linus looked so happy, thats so cool :)
We need this every year. So happy for Linus AND JIMMY to be lucky enough to have Linus grace him with his presence.
After watching Linus for over a decade, it's great to see that he's still human and gets nervous. Then falls into more of his comfort zone as they get past the small talk and into the tech.
Well done guys, this is going to be amazing exposure for you! I can't wait to see how well the Tonight Show does now that Linus has been on it!
I have the Xreal and they are cool but the cables are annoying
They're gonna need some bucks to give him a segment every month or so. Like the wildlife guy but 2025.
Linus didn’t drop anything !
We got Linus on late night before GTA 6.
It's very performant, but I enjoyed it. :D
Linus is so nervous! ❤
That's awesome!
you can see linus impostor syndrome all over him is kind of funny
He’s so genuinely giddy, it fills my heart
What the hell is Linus doing on here.
Wow this guy is good. He should start a youtube channel! 😁
MY GOAT
Wow it's such a surprise to see Linus here 🙂
I was waiting for the lttstore promo 😢
LOVE LINUS <3
Dude what's up with the million earrings
Wait what.....
Way to go Linus!! Canadian till we die!
This has been our for less than 12 hours and I can only find 1 or 2 videos on this channel with more views.
can't wait to watch the wan show where linus talks about how freaking nervous and out of his comfort zone he was...
he was nervous as HELL LMAOOO
Lol Linus with all that make-up reminds me of Edward from Twilight😂
thank you for giving this small channel a chance to gain traction, thank you Linus
He was in overdrive! Unless that was asked beforehand to be very excited, but he kinda always is with tech
This is the weirdest timeline. Can’t say I expected this lol. Cool :D
We making it outta YouTube with this one
I’m glad that a person from our STEM fields are getting the spotlight. Especially Linus who does so much good for his community!!
Bad Bunny is on low volumen mood💀
Did Benito give back the glasses? 👀
Hope you are invited again, Linus! :D
Linus seemed way more hyper then normal
Thought the title said "Little Sebastian" and got really excited for a moment.
Who the fuck is bad bunny?
This was very strange but very funny 😂😂
What was Linus nervous about he crushed it
I LOVE THIS
first 30 seconds -linus freaking out being on tv with famous peopel moment a tech question stats being asked...he kicks into gear.
Proof we live in a simulation
Linus probably gets better ratings than Fallon
Bad Bunny embarrassed PR. Kissing dudes and sold his culo
Wow!
Okay, but Veilguard??? Nah
Linus has been desperate for some good PR lately
Dam Linus nailed it
This is the first Jimmy Fallon video i’ve watched in years. Here for Linus!
I started yelling at my wife hey Linus is on a talk show! I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw you sitting next to Jimmy. Well done, man I still remember you from NCIX. RIP
We love Linus!
The fact that linus wasn't the one to break to commercials hurts my heart.
The genuine reactions at the end beat out all the scripted, that was awesome :)
Jimmy was initially bored, but soon he became completely absorbed in Linus.
6:14 - BadBunny straight up ganked those glasses. lmao
<3 shout out to linus. dont be nervous dude you did great
Those were some wild tech tips from the tech tipper king.
That was awesome 🤩 LTT squad!
Linus dropping Tech Tips to Network Media... we made it, nerds.
The Sex Tips have made it into real TV
Recognition ❤🎉
Linus gets star struck? :D
Linus, is sooooooooooo nervous! happy for you my guy!
And lenovo got a free ad!!
So dope to see LTT on the show!! Bring more techtubers to traditional TV!!
Production, make this a regular item please?
We made it boys and girls!
Linus killed it. 100$ he becomes a regular on the show
Linus still rocking the sandals and socks for the culture.
Shocked to see LTT on the freaking tonight show. A little nervous, but understandable. Good job dude!
El conejo malo 🙌🏽🐰😈
Holy shit. Good for Linus.
Woah. How did Linus end up on Jimmy Fallon's show? Quite cool.
I really thought they were gonna plug the LTT backpack
I'm chessing right now
Linus gets more views than any mainstream tv channel
most viral video on this channel.. LTT on Jimmy Follon. how about that.
Hmmm
he’s on jimmy fallonnnnnnn
Jimmy was visibly annoyed but him. That's the Hollywood elite mindset. If you aren't worth 100 mil at least and are a known actor you are not in the same club.
"You ever look down and realize you could use a few extra inches?" - Linus
Happy for Linus
You can tell how nervous Linus is, but big dub for him. And bro still pulled up in the socks and sandals 😂
We’ve made it boys.
Tf
It’s friggin Linus heck ya
Aye
Is there such a thing as a good fever dream? because that's my most accurate description for this video
He is awkward here, but he is such a great, smart and lovely guy and should be recognized more!
"How do they do that?" "Dont worry about it"  In other words there's not enough time to explain how it works and you'll probably still not understand it afterwards 😂😂
I’m surprised he didn’t drop anything
WTF YEEEEEÉS LINUS
What world are we living when we have BadBunny and Linus Tech Tips on the Tonight Show
bad bunny - the only hispanic superstar being used as a companys diversity hire 😂😂😂😂😂
look at my boy all grown up
Where's King Kong 😮‍💨
What???
So happy for you Linus! Congratulations!
You treat our people well, and we treat you well. Thanks for having our Sock-Sandal Man Jimmy!
I don't know who those two guys were, but Linus was funny as hell
That's  my boy!
Bro keep the glasses
Made it through the entire segment without dropping the hard R, proud of you Linus!
"Don't worry about it" in tech either means it's hella expensive or actually involves demons
So proud you Linus. Hope we get to see more interviews.
You explained this so well, thank you!
Ignoring Bad Bunny, this was great! Linus should be invited to more shows!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Linus is officially a loser
So proud of Linus!!! Been watching ever since the Langley house days, early 2014. :)
Wow, Linus turned into Horst Fuchs 100% (WS Teleshop presenter)
Must be that, "hey ma i'm on TV nervounes." And no seqways to sponsor even 😏
Thought i was tweakin when i saw this on my recommended
Watching Linus for almost a decade, this is extremely surreal
He didn't drop anything! lol
Linus is officially a Canadian National Treasure
Oh man you can tell the nerves in the first minute. Well now I know what Linus + waaay too much meth would look like. Thanks Jimmy!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Who the f is bad bunny?
Seeing Linus on a show like this makes me so happy. Dude has a crazy work ethic and what he has grown through LMG is incredible. I am also a huge fan of the merch he has made over the years. Some of it is too flashy for my style however the stuff I have purchased has held up extremely well. The OG Backpack is stupid expensive but it has been made to last and it has gone on numerous cross country trips and countless flights since I have purchased it, yet it still looks brand new.
It's about time. For the record I had no idea who bad bunny was until this. I honestly thought it was a female rapper.
His balls reverse dropped.
3:56 This is thought every man and boy has once in his life, and both Bad Bunny and Fallon lit up while hearing that
When people say wasn't expecting this on  2025 bingo card 😂
A new low...
WHERE CAN I GET THAT BACKPACK THAT!?
Amazing.
I meant to actually watch this when it ame on yesterday on tv but I was watching football and I forgot about it. Well, I'm glad I got YouTube so I can still see it. Ya did great Linus!
i wish i was able to see what they were seeing exactly, on the last glasses
It is like watching Jack Hanna on the old tonight show.
In just 10 hours Linus got more views than Hugh Jackman did over 10 days. Nerds rule! 🤓
This is what passion looks like and what it can do if you pursue it in the right ways take notes younglings.
Jimmy: "How do they do that?"  Company that makes them: "Don't worry about it, your data is safe"
I swear he’s not acting he’s fanning over other celeb my gosh he’s still as when I seen him first awesome
the sandals made it lol
So cool
"Mama we made it!!!" Lol
"How did they do that???" - Don't worry about it.
Gamers Nexus is SO mad right now.
Glad to see Linus finally get some attention from the rest of the world.  He has been a very big influence in the tech community for so long, he deserves this!
This was so cool. Great job Linus!
Nice video 😊
Bro looks the same even after 20 years
Too much coffee.
should i google waifu?
Linus is the "big bro" of the YT pc/tech building community along with other "bros" and "cousins".
WTF??? Did not expect THIS - LOL 😆
he is so nervous lol  linus lets go tech can take you anywhere happy
Can't wait for linus to have his own star in hollywood!!  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Love it 😀
Linus is such a beautiful soul, so happy for him!
my new fav episode :D
E
The only videos on Jimmy's channel in the past month with more views than Linus are his interviews with Lee Jung-Jae and Jamie Lee Curtis. Whoever convinced Jimmy to have Linus on needs a raise
Bad Bunny sneaking the glasses into his jacket pocket 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Some say Linus is still looking for his glasses.
Our nerd has made it momma!!!
This isn't real
You can tell jimmy and bad bunny where trynna calm him down at first lol
hes so nervous im gona cry. so happy for him and the team
Hahaha this was great! Linus reminded me of  the Jack Hannah of tech.
Linus teaching Jimmy Fallon about waifus was already worth the (free) price of admission 😂 I'm not a fan of Jimmy as a host (I liked him on SNL, though), but this was worth the watch if only because having digital content creators highlighted on traditional TV talk shows is huge.  "How do they do that?" "...don't worry about it." Linus understands the audience 😂
last time I saw a Youtuber in The Tonight Show, was Freddie Wong And Matt Arnorld talking about Video Game High School. And that was 10 years ago now. so I am very glad seeing Linus and talk about LTT.
I am no american, I don't care about night shows but... Knocked Loose and Linus Sebastian both on Jimmy? I officially watched parts of this night show more than any other
this is surreal wtf lol what timeline are we living in
All I wanna know is did Bad Bunny get away with the glasses?
in think you all should have linus on regularly to talk about new tech
THIS WAS AWESOME!! HUUGE W FOR LTT
When my friend gets all excited about his tech hobby i will send him this. Bc this explains us. Him so excited to tell everything and me listening and be amazed
Rough start, but the moment the tech came out and Linus was back in his element and relaxed a bit it turned into a banger segment!  Wasn't expecting to see LTT on late night television, but I'm here for it!
Tech nerd at its finest 👌
Late night TV has turned into daytime TV. What is this shit that they have to bring on YouTubers from the more popular medium....online.
who is the bad bunny idiot?
he’s so nervous hahaha
A wee bit sad that this entire show became all about the tech. I mean, I love tech. But it feels like it could have been more about Linus.
Never thought this would happen, wonderful
So did bad bunny actually return the glasses or he kept them 😂. Seeing Linus on TV and him being so nervously excited makes me happy. They need to bring more yt creators on more often.
Linus finally fix his hair. he never fix his hair in his video. looks wired now
The Sandals make an appearance
20 years of Youtube and Linus has developed a cadence and gravitas fit for prime time TV! #PCMASTERRACE
Man Linus is so nervous, never seen him like that in over 10 years I've been watching his channel
Linus is the best
More views than TV and movie stars!
So glad you guys had Linus on the show I was not expecting this
Wow Linus, wow
Damn Linus was so nervous at first 😂 but he did get used to being there once he was talking more and more about the tech.
This reminds of when Jimmy went on diggnation years ago.
What? - first video where he didnt drop the tech on the floor?
More linus! Lets go!
This is a great way to stimulate the market, just have fun with stuff
I presented 2 new products at CES and one of them ended up selling well, while the other was too expensive to produce. Really amazing experience.
This may be the longest Fallon has gone without faking laughing
Ltt❤
WE LOVE LINUS
I love Linus’s tech tips
I’m soo happy, one of my most favourite YouTubers is finally having his limelight moment. He deserves it truly and his nervousness shows that
He looks like he has tv makeup on lol
Lol , I was expecting the sponsor Segway somewhere in the video , lol 😂.
1st time linus doesnt say sponsor stuff
Painful to watch him so nervous 😞
I love seeing Linus on here!
Should make Linus a regular segment for the latest cool tech, like you used to have the science experiments
linus killed it with the selection of items wow
Nice backpack
I am just so happy for Linus and his team about this.   Man i wish I was an employee of LTT <3
I watch this show selectively when it has on guests i know.  I'm very glad Linus got to be on this show.  More opportunities like this need to be given to well rounded content creators.
This is actually an amazing way to introduce the uninitiated to the existence of CES
bad bunny and linus with fallon is an insane rotation of people around ewach other
Captn super shill lol
how can you not be a fan of linus? youtube tech reviews to fallon is quite the glow up
Man it's good to see Linus getting this kind of publicity, you worked hard for it! Well deserved❤
Well this was unexpected but banger 🗣💯🔥
"It's like a digital girlfriend"  Jimmy's Brain: "WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN"
I get it that Linus deffo was nervous, bit damn! He's like a rabbit on speed here. 😂 Congrats on your big TV debute!
I usually don't watch these shows (I miss Craig Ferguson) but watched this ep for LS and he did great! You can def see the nerves but anyone who's not used to it would feel the same. Kind of wish he'd been given a little more time.
Never thought I’d see the little guy in the tonight show!! That’s awesome!!
They should have let you segue to the sponsor 🤣
That can't be Linus, he didn't drop anything.
Linus tech is SOOOOO FRIGGIN NERVOUS!
what timeline are we in?? 😂😭 so proud of Linus though hahaha 💪🔥
Incredible performance Linus! A tip to your tech m’lord.
I don't get artist. BB is extremely hateful and xenophobic towards us citizens to the point that he wants Puertoricans to lose their US citizensship why is he on Jimmy Fallon.
Oooo, Linus sure has a nice backpack! I wonder where one could get it 😏
Benitoooo te amoooo❤
Wow, havn't seen my boi nervous like this in many years. I love to see it.  well done Linus, it's tough having cameras on you during something you had no real power over.  Good job!
Brought to you by Dbrand?
Love Linus! He did such a good job!
Linus Going Hard....😌😌😌😌
Linus is bae
What that goofy boy doing on tv
He looks like that milf hunter that why he is funny
Whos that guy with black suit?
This guy seems chill he should start a YouTube channel or something
Yep, sandals and socks. Guess LTT gets to keep my subscription.
Watching Linus and bad bunny together something I didn't know I needed
love LTT
I dont like his music, but id watch the tonight show with bad bunny
As nervous as he was, he didn't drop a single device! TV magic, baby.
Why is linus on here?
Guess they couldn’t get anyone else on the show this week.
I heard p diddy gave the bad part of the name to bad bunny, tore him apart
he seam so natural on his own videos..... he was definitely getting overloaded with excitement playing in someone elses playground
What is happening
Congrats
8:21 "Linus's tech tips are on YouTube " This is not incorrect.
can't stand that boy for some reason. Which is weird cause I also think he's a good guy. But he wouldn't have carried the segment without the props from CES so that was a good call by the producers.
I dont like Jimmy Fallon... im only here for Linus
Awesome segment Linus!
i said Woah! as soon as i saw the thumbnail and then clicked immediately
This was so cool. I've been watching Linus, since day one. Congrats LLT
given ltt history im concerned he legit stole that laptop out of CES
When he said the backpack I was waiting for ltt store ad lol. Great job Linus
Linus Looked nervous but so excited. Love this for him
Now you should invite Tech Jesus (Steve from Gamers Nexus) also!
It’s so wholesome how excited Linus was. Glad the masses got to see our favorite nerd, nerd out with some cool tech. Good on Jimmy for having a YouTuber on the show.
Linus, Jimmy y Bad Bunny la wea más random que he visto 😂
idk why the comments says he looked nervous I think he was super professional. even though the guest isn't expected to entertain he went into presenter mode with his voice inflections and stuff his jokes did hit, I think wan show linus would've been a bit boring he pretty much acted like a celebrity if not better.
Linus Tech Tips has a last name?
That was awesome!
Bad bunny with the "Diablo kbron" when he put on the glasses is absolutely hilarious
I will say it made me super uncomfortable to see Linus in the first few minutes. Not uncomfortable because I was embarrassed for him or by him, but I I saw myself in uncomfortable or in situations like that where I have to interact with someone that is a higher position than me in my job. Something humbling about seeing like, to my standards anyways, someone beyond more successful than I will ever be and at this point a celebrity still get nervous. Makes feel like I am not a total weirdo and it is just me.
he needed to drop something to make it "more Scripted"
Nervous at first but killed it with the choices on what to show
Bad bunny lambón marioneta
This whole video is just an advertisement. Pathetic.
I love that Youtubers are becoming legit celebrities.
He cooked!!!
Gotta wear the ltt hoodie and the ltt backpack😂
Idk what timeline I am in but I’m staying here
I didn't have Linus going on late night shows on my 2025 bingo card.  Never seen him so jittery and nervous in my life - after watching LTT for nearly a decade.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
I'm so confused. Is that Bad Bunny??
pathetic PR attempt for all the deserved negativity linus has recieved to his response of the paypal honey scandal.   yeah listen lets get the most insufferable guy in tech review on a show with the most insufferable late night host. great job guys PR crisis averted
My boy has come so far.
Love it, Linus doesn't realize how much he has influenced people around the world. His love of tech and love of sharing it with people have inspired many, including myself. I went from someone scared to build a computer, to just casually swapping hardware out. Amazing segment Linus.
I hope we see more bad bunny in the shades. lolololol
omg Linus and Jimmy together!
The Linus, Jimmy Fallon, and Bad Bunny collab. No one would've ever imagined.
Ha, Linus looks so awkward sitting in the big boy chair, like he's not meant to be there, and he knows it. Please don't shadow ban me, I mean this in a positive way
This video has 10x more views than other videos on this channel. Linus Sebastian supporting a smaller creators 😂
Loved watching Jimmy and Benito playing with their new toys. I think both glasses are gonna sell through the roof, like we say here in Puerto Rico "como pan caliente". It is the first time I've seen Linus but I'm a fan already. His energy and charisma are contagious. No wonder he's now on national tv.  I wish him the best.
The trio we never knew we needed.
I can't describe how much cringe does that mf Jimmy gives me always he try to be "cool" with the guests.
Honestly I would tune out the audience to play Baldur’s Gate 3.
I hope he got his glasses back.
Regular LTT viewer here. He did great! He was nervous at first tho haha
Linus is so super exited! Congratulations on making it on real TV bro. I've been watching you since your NCIX days and watched your channel grow to what it is today. PS: say hello to Riley....
I love the fact that Linus is rockin' the sandals... even on The Tonight Show.
Linus is GEEKING TF OUT bro Congrats
This broke my brain, but I'm here for it.
That computer is kind of a metaphor for real life because You get the right person to touch my button and I also grow.
He's like Steve Irwin, but with tech.
Linus' Yapping personality kicking in every time he had to talk tech
@LinusTechTips is such a cool guy. I have been following him since his videos at NCIX. Love his channel and videos.
Today I learned who Bad Bunny is thanks to Linus
not the sandals on tv bro
Its crazy. I literally watched you and your channel grow. You’re very intelligent and I love your videos. It’s been an honor watching you these past years
Hey, don't put down robots.I went ces and came home with my new girlfriend.Who will never leave me. Because I just paid two hundred and fifty thousand for 1 in a dream where I had two hundred and fifty thousand and wasn't broke.
I have watched Linus for about 10 years. His work has opened up the world of tech to millions of people making computers more accessible. I doubt he truly realizes how much good he's done.
Ai is really impressive now. I almost thought this was a real  video.
7:35 _EL DIABLO_
Hell yeah, Linus geeking out in the MSM
"Wanna sponsor this video we are planning? We can *probably* get your Product on Late Night Shows and National TV and get Jimmy Fallon to join in, but no guarantee."  LMG Marketing 2025 , Probably. Lenovo : *Say no more fam*
Linus showing the CES tech had Penn and Teller energy
as soon as bad bunny touched those color changing glasses I saw the wheels spinning in his head for his next music video
This is so random and I love it.
LINUSSSSSSSSS
*Who is Linus?*
Did Linus remind Jimmy that LTT gets better ratings? Jimmy should be honored
linus said 'waifu' on public TV it made me feel physical pain
probably, possibly, maybe, allegedly the best interview on the tonight show, ever
Wait what? No way....! This is amazing proud of ya LTT!
This is awesome congratulations to Linus and everyone at LMG. I never thought I'd see a bit of LTT on Fallon or any talkshow
Loved the content, keep it coming!
I see a tradition with Linus coming on talk shows to show off new tech, just like when an animal expert comes on. This was amazing
GG Linus :D
WAN show is gonna be lit on Friday!
Crazy how nerves he is. I suppose he isn't used to a general audience. I couldn't do it. Well done for going on it
Linus excitedly bragging about cool tech to normie is funny cuz their reaction is so clueless haha and Linus is so nervous!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
This is so trippy but so cool! Once he locks in, he's back to his usual self! Thank you so much, Tonight Show!
What's wild is how the view count on this video is stomping on other vids on the channel.  Linus is good for business.
W Linus
why was i expecting a backpack plug
This dude is better off entertaining people than giving false data
why is bad bunny there tho LMAO
You can take Linus out of Vancouver but you can't take the Vancouver out of Linus. Representing Canada! 100% proud.
So we’re not going to talk about how horrible they are to their staff?
Hi linus
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
Gotta say... this was incredibly uncomfortable and its crazy to see the difference between a YouTube star and a television star.
Oh WOW.
Now I know that late night TV still exists. Not for me.
Totally wasn't expecting to randomly see Linus on Fallon
Wish the broadcast didn’t edit out like.. the whole segment, but glad this is here!  Love ya Linus.
2:16 the future is here hazzah 6:51 i hope it aint sao but bofuri
this was awesome , see linus nervous is what i never seen before , thank you for the show
great segment and greater Linus
Big W for the tech homies
YEAH SOCKS AND SANDALS
Linus had that "Hi, mom! I'm on TV!" nervous and excited type of energy!   Stoked to see one of my heroes in a spot of the limelight, doing his thing and killing it.
Bad Bunny just fell in love with theses glasses
Linus wore his socks/sandals combo on the tonight show... wonder how many times they've seen that!!
The massive disconnect from the host and the guess this time is unreal cause both of the host are so uninterested till the shiny thing comes out and Linus is genuinely trying to show off CES products
wtf planet are we on where Linus throws a bone to a late night jimmy and agrees to go on their show? lol its nice of linus to help out a little guy
Whaaaat
Linus was super nervous but in a really endearing, relatable way it didn't feel awkward at all and I think he was great!
Linus blew it. Too much talking, energy overwhelming, geeking out. Keep it together man.
I've never seen two men so obviously on coke
what did they give him to be that hyper lol
YES!!!
gg linus ......gg
Linus and bad bunny in the same video. 😂 wow
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
why does jimmy sit so close to that other dude its distracting
this clip has more views than any other recent Tonight Show clip on this channel... my boy has finally made it 🥲
2:20 he said wifu on a talk show? damn
Techtubing taking mainstream...interesting, hope it doesn't take political turn.
Wasnt on my bingo card
Well, I wasn't expecting to see that Linus was on regular TV but here we are lol
Linus is so humble helping  Jimmy and Bad Bunny get started on tv ❤
love to see linus so damn excited
I LOVE LTT!!
OMG Linus was on Jimmy Fallon, how cool is that 👍👍❤
Our boi is so nervous...-kawaiXD
I can’t believe one of the most influential people of my island + one of the most influential people of my hobby in one of the most influential late night tv show simultaneously. Pero Benito tiene a la producción sudando 🤣
Linus Belongs to us. He was there for a moment to give the people on the other side a taste of what we, the tech enthusiasts experience every single day.
Greetings, greetings of interaction,,
ग्रोस लोग , ग्रोस शो
As a Puerto Rican IT Professional. This was a dream come true lol😂 my two worlds are colliding and I can barely comprehend it
Linus was great!! Jimmy wasn't though.
We Got Linus On Jimmy Fallon Show Before Gta 6😄
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
wooot Linus on TV show
The clash of two worlds.
This is so amazing, he’s so geeked on being on tv.
Linus did some lines before starting
Loved the content, keep it coming!
where's the segue to our sponsor?
We got Linus Tech Tips with Bad Bunny before GTA 6
Look at Linus nervous as hell. Still a real boy in there despite what people think.
This is cool!!
Congrats linus! You definitely deserve it my first ever PC build was watching a walk through of you back in 2013 totally changed my life and made me smarter thank you! And thanks Jimmy for this incredible recognition on linus bro is a tech savage!
a bit of face powder there, our boy is ready for first day of school
I thought his last name was TechTips
of course he finds a way to show his back pack
Thought it was April for a second but glad to see Linus getting recognition he deserves.
One of my favorite nerds in the world showing off. In my times I would be bullied for that😅, nice to see you there Linus.
Linus must've sold out (his soul) just so he could go mainstream 😂
A different Linus but still so cute
Not what I had on my bingo card for 2025, but nice to see all the same. YouTubers on National TV
OoooH!
How’s it feel to get views again Jimmy!? This video alone is already up to HALF your weekly tv viewership… nice of Linus to come help a failing network.
So we’re not going to talk about how horrible they are to their staff?
Linus absolutely killed it here.
He's never sounded this Canadian, he sounds like a totally different person
Wut
The youtube show is amazing
Linus absolutely ATE, let’s go our tech king
Nice job Linus!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Often, feels like usually, when a tech tuber is on mainstream media, it's pretty bad. A disaster, even. Linus did a great job, tho. He brought stuff that was engaging and people might actually be interested in.
Lol, I thought this video was ai for hot second 😂. Linus always love to see you!
this is a deep fake AI generated Linus, because he didn't say "segue" or "lttstore"
Most asked Q must be can a get a free PC ? ;) I love the shades !!!
The makeup department did him dirty
What is this time line we are living on??
I didn't realize LTT was still a thing.
The goat
W collab with bad bunny and LTT
If you keep having guests like this I might be tempted to start watching more
No way, fake videos has come along way, long live AI!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
These YouTubers have grown up to be millionaires!
Linus did great! Never doubted him, although the waifu joke obviously didn't land, different audience than he's used to. But still very quick witted and a lot of great jokes in there.
Linus!!!
Lost em with the Waifu, reeled em back in with the shades
I would have never expected Linus Tech Tips and Bad Bunny ever be in the same room together, interacting with each other.
Bad Bunny was so funny n cute stealing the sunglasses 😂🤩😂😎😂
Linus let’s gooo!!
Made my day seeing my favorite content creator on jimmy fallon he did great!
Pretty cool Eh.
new reoccurring segment please!
More guests like Linus!
linus dresses like sh1t and Fallon is a phony ..
This is the most i have watched the tonight show in years. Thanks for having Linus on.
He's like the Crocodile Hunter for gadgets. LoL
How to tell a YTers about to start their right winged arc. They get famous.
Haven’t seen nervous Linus in quite a while, he’s completely out of his element talking to normies but he still nailed it, you can see the jokes don’t quite land the same but he does a great job, too bad it was too short of a segment
How the hell didn't he plug LTTstore for the backpack? Still, good job Linus!
This was so fuckin awesome and well deserved for Linus.
Wow!! so tense!!
we finally made it to the big leagues!
DO MORE OF THIS!! Awesome Awesome interview and segment!
This is so wholesome. I’ve been watching since damn near the beginning. So incredible to see Linus get to this point. Incredible work ethic.
(shows picture of Linus's old video) (looks identical) We were spoiled by Daddy Linus while we had him.
There should be a new Tech Segment starring Linus.
is linus wearing makeup
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Am I reading the Tonight Show comment section, or the Wan Show comment section? I'm confused 😂  LTT gang representing!
LTT ❤
El pana de Diddi, Diddi's friend.
Bad Bunny says "Diablo Cabrón" when wearing the the nreal glasses I guess the closes thing I can translate it to is "Damn motherfucker"
Linus being on Jimmy Fallon is def not something I expected 😂
XDDDDDDDDDDDD
How nice of you to help out the little guy by going to their legacy TV show bravo my friend
What a nerd
You did well Linus. 🎉
wtf
First and last appearance.
Mkbhd?! More...?!
Linus absolutely deserved this moment
Linus was almost vibrating he was so excited. I love it! Congratulations Linus & LMG!
Hopefully bad buddy got them glasses,, I’m sure he’ll cash app the nerd
2:30 seconds in an Linus somehow how managed to bring up waifus you can “interact” with 😂
really? getting desperate for guests? what's a bad bunny? lol. Mind blowing?? damn even jimmy is stooping to click bait bs!!
Oh my gosh hi Linus
Dude what an unexpected crossover. Bad Bunny too, no less.
Nerd watching this show... wtf is a bad bunny?
Oh, look. It's a no-talent clown being featured on a show by a low-talent clown. 🤡 🙄
My man in sock in sandels
Linus is so natural in front of his own cameras. It's funny saying him squirm in front of these.
@2:46 Linus must be good at his job, Jimmy was looking at that pen like it was important... 😂
lol he's so nervous and excited but i think he killed it in the end!
You did it. You crazy son of a bitch, you did it...
Great job, this video was very useful!
Bb se quedo con las gafas 🤣
You need to bring Linus back on a quarterly basis to share new technology. Its a must.
When the fans are actually infront of him and there’s more camera acting Linus goes out the window 😂
Where's the segue?
Man, linus a small creator being on tv is crazy
I'm a bit sad they cut the bit when Linus sat down and gave into the urge to bounce on the chair a little.
Fantastic job Linus!
Congrats Linus and team! We are so proud of you for getting here! Your years of hard work, dedication to your community, and standing by your values have gotten you to where you are today, and I cant wait to see the places it will take you in the future. Again we are all so proud to see you up on that stage. Its like watching our tech dad getting all excited about his big promotion. Keep up the amazing work!
hi linus i still dont know who are Jimmy and Bad Bunny but it is nice that you brought some extra CES for them with you.
This could easily be a recurring segment.
Proud of Linus for introducing the general public to Waifu
I never saw Linus so nervous 😮
why is this video sped up, linus sounds so nervous
I was waiting for this, super cool to see Linus out of his zone. I wonder if Jimmy ever got to see Linus on the WAN show talking about how nervous he was before this. Glad to see him relax after the Intro. This was pretty flipping awesome to see for a guy who made videos out of a store.  Also, I wonder if this is going to bring on more viewers considering a youtuber brought more viewers to the show on youtube than a segment on trump, Pamela Anderson, or whoever else you've had on in the last couple months.
linus wtf are u doing here
they could have at least linked @LinusTechTips YouTube channel.
bro i love how excited linus is! I am I would be too! damn linus on jimmy fallon
I can't understand that what did Kendall Jenner see in Bad Bunny.....
600k views!!! You have to get Linus back!!!
I’m waiting for the mandatory ltt store plug.
Linus teaching Jimmy Fallon about waifus was not in my 2025 bingo card, but here we are.
no offense to the laptop I think thats the least cool one there the second one the glasses not bad but the last one I can see being a huge hit tbh probably wont be cheap by any means but that would make mobile/handheld gaming actually really fun and interesting.
Jimmy is unbearable
W Linus !
Yes! Linus is bigger than almost everyone in "real" TV.
Bring back Linus for more tech tips
Linus is the best!!!!!
" son what's a Waifu"
Audience not passing the vibe check
bro said waifu on live television 💀
He is so excited and nervous. It's kind of cute to see him overwhelmed a bit. But, man are they from different worlds. And yet, by the end Linus drew the late ones into the tech world.
This feels AI generated
One of the smartest people (Linus) + the dumbest mofo around the globe (Bad Music Bunny)... well played Jimmy! well played..
People are in for such a shock if they go on to watch the WAN show. Luke must be jealous that Jimmy got a few words in edge ways
Linus what did you do, scare Jimmy into believing things? Congratulations Linus I laughed my head off.
mf creates toxic work place exploits employees and now he buys show time on who cares and tries to achieve what??
He's soooo nervous
Linus looks so happy
You explained this so well, thank you!
LTT hoodie, cargo pants, and most importantly, socks and sandals... He will never change. lmaoo
Oh my goodness, I can't remember the last time Linus looked this nervous and excited on someone else's video lol This was so heartwarming to watch.
He better be an often guest and bring more tech stuff...
cringey
Legend says that one sunglass is still missing :D
Didn't expect that crossover.  Just goes to show how desperate these late-night shows are, the tables have turned, and now they rely on internet personalities to provide them with content. Television is dead.
It's hilarious to watch Linus lock in as soon as the tech comes out.   I could see this being either a Annual CES review segment, OR if they did it around Thanksgiving I'm sure Linus would do a decent job at doing a "top gift guide" for super tech enthusiasts.   They should've allowed him to do a segue to commercials though, missed opportunity for the LTT fans lol
Linus did great!
Linus Is A True Fan Boy, And You Can Tell He Wasn't Prepared At All For The Elation That Comes With Being In Front Of 5.2 Million Viewers All At Once.
Watching  the TV merge with YouTube ….live enough to see it
Linus it's always nice to see you support the smaller guys
I haven't seen Lunis this excited in years
our boy made it!!!! also Look at  the views!! Tonight show haven't had a video with this many views in a long time,.
Linus on Jimmy Fallon with Bad Bunny is the most random collab ever 😂
Not a fallon fan and no idea who bad bunny is but he'll yeah Linus on live TV for once!   Where was the segue to the sponsor.😂
Big boy Linus now on TV! That’s awesome!
I think the whole video is a huge segue to his sponsors
Who are these people Linus stupid question for?
Wasn't expecting Linus to show up in a live audience mainstream show haha
Linus!!!!!! Awesome...you on real TV pal
The Nerds have inherited the Earth! 🤯The YouTube stars have inherited the Earth! 🤯GAME OVER CELEBRITIES!📢📢
Kinda stupid that this is region locked...
Put some respek on Linus’s name
Linus getting the spotlight he deservers.
Wow, I've never seen Linus so nervous but when he started talking tech and CES, the nervousness vanished. Congrats Linus!
Nice, it's a shame they put so much makeup on Sebastian's face he looks a like a porcelain doll
This is the strangest crossover I have ever seen.
"Don't worry about it. Magic."   Dude straight Arthur C Clarke'd em!
https://www.youtube.com/@SOUTHERNBACKWOODZPRODUCTION
🙈🙈 i feel linus's excitement
This was not in my bingo list
He didn't even drop anything!
Jimmy should have let him do the segue, to their sponsors.
sick, I love LTT!
Congrats Linus!
This is so surreal seeing Linus on the Tonight Show.
I dont think they deserved your enthusiasm linus i just think they were tryna speed through your segment. You deserve better
2:32 jimmy has clearly missed out on 20 years worth of internet and anime culture lmfao  6:03 linus clearly put a bit of thought into what he'd bring on stage lmao. everything is something both the audience and normie hosts can understand the "cool" factor of
Linus has truly made it. Was he wearing his sandals during the interview?
This is fkn entertainment!!!! Hell yea been watching this dude for years. Steve is somewhere punching walls right now he wasn't able to cancel him and surpass him. 😂
More of that segment. Those sunglasses were nuts
Doesn't Linus look like a guy who carries around a bag pack? you didn't get that from the sandals
Hmm.. nervous Linus.. gonna need more public appearances
Linus could be a regular with that energy. Real Johnny with that lady from the San Diego zoo vibes.
That's our guy
lol What no segway?
Incredible. Great to see this. Go Canada! 🇨🇦🍁
Linus looks like he’s been working out!!
Linus was very highly caffeinated for this interview and I suspect without much sleep.
First time I see linus so nervous in front of a camera
A case of AAAAAAHDHD
Dbrand missed the jump on this one....  Awesome of Jimmy to put him on!
I'm sure Jimmy loved having Linus on. Jimmys a huge gaming fan.
Proud of you Linus!
finally our boy made it to Jimmy Fallon
He really said waifu, oh god. 😂
huge break for jimmy and bunny
Who would have thought my favorite tech youtuber and my favorite wrestler would be on the Tonight Show.
They need more shows like this with the real people
So proud of you, Linus!! This was awesome!
This should have been in the whole production, it flows better.
LINUSSSSSSSS! My man!!!
there is something about jimmy which makes me think he's actually NOT having fun at his own show. the constant disgust of his face and acting.... ehm
Thanks brother 😂
Can't wait for the WAN show to hear linus's thoughts on this.
Clean shaven Linus with a high pitch voice is straight from the early 2010s
Linus doing side quests
Manny grossman  a pimp
LTT in the house!🎉
Missed opportunity to have bad bunny segue to your sponsor, lol
Who are the other guys with Linus?
Congrats man!!!!
I've never seen Linus so nervous
Where can they purchase that spiffy back pack? Tbh, Linus pulls more views than jimmy fallon 😂
uh I was totally expecting a plug for the backpack lol
They are onto something here! Make Linus comeback more often to tell the world about new and interesting tech!
wait got this in my recommended, what do you mean Jimmy Fallon, Bad Bunny and Linus on the same TV set??? This is AMAZING LOOOL
I can confirm the fact that it was linus that got me interested about computers initially . I had a background with playing some games on my pc as a kid , and it kind of developed into a hobby . Then all of a sudden i discovered scrapyard wars on youtube , and the rest is history !! Thanks so much Linus , for all the valuable content you have created over the years!!!
Wow
Can’t believe Jimmy said segue and there was no sponsor.
Honest to god we need to see more Linus on late night shows. I guess it always made sense but once he got used to it the chemistry was there in a way that you would see with like the Erwin family bringing in zoo animals or something.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Hey, A quad yearly segment with Linus being the intermediary between you and new tech could be a genuine savior. we loved it. You will learn to. Make it happen team who reads this.
It's kinda weird seeing linus being the one all giddy lol
He was so nervous at the beginning but Linus is a cool guy
The new Joshua... Finally! great show!
So bizarre seeing Linus on Fallon. I've followed Linus longer than any talk show.
Never expected Linus to be on this show!😂
SO proud of the LTT team, and Linus himself, for going through everything he went through, to get to where they all are today. They've helped me beyond what I could have ever dreamed of, and I'm happy they finally had a chance to be in the public limelight, ON LIVE TV!!! Hope to meet Linus one day, because I truly look up to him and his team. Thanks for giving him a chance, NBC & The Tonight Show Crew/Team!!! :)
This video has about 25% more views than the 4 other videos with Bad Bunny COMBINED. Jimmy should take that as a lesson. All of old media should.
Dang I did not expect to see Linus on Jimmy Fallon but I’m so happy for him!
Oh man, gotta love Linus' energy, but I think he came in his pants haha.
Funny as hell to see Linus so nervous to be on Fallon when Linus pulls more viewers per "show" than the Tonight Show Does......
this should be a recurring segment 😂
That was awesome!!! You need to bring him back next year!
This segment needs to be a permanent atleast monthly or something.
Linus is all of the internet's tech father!
@LinusTechTips finally hitting the bigtime.  I'm sad we didn't get an LTTSTORE read in there.
The year barely started and we have "Linus explaining waifu to Jimmy Fallon" already checked. The 2025 bingo card is gonna be wild
When you watch Linus for long enough you can tell when he’s nervous 🤣
bro wtf
It's fun how nervous Linus seemed when he first started. Got more in his element as he started showing the tech. Still seemed a bit nervous, but hid it better.  EDIT: It seems just about everyone posted exactly this. Now it looks like a bot. I'm a real person, I swear!
This is the first time I've heard Linus's voice for more than 3 minutes without hearing a segway... To our sponsor!
I'm so proud of Linus!!!🎉🎉🎉
If Linus wasn't this nervous, I'd say it was a montage
You can tell when he transitions from nervous and trying to fill every second of silence, to excited and enthused, and *needing* to fill every second.
Good thing that Jimmy is married to be ignorant about Japanese people's obsession with robots as girlfriends
oh its cool jimmy fallon invited make a wish kid
"a few more inches would be nice" 🤣
Definitely bring him back next year for a little product roundup after CES
PCMR unite 6Ghz All core OC stable!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely bonkers that 9 hours in, the Linus segment has 5 times the views of Bad Bunny. The waifu wink was hilarious.
Wowwww linussss
Awesomeness glad to see you on American TV show most definitely hopefully again soon I've sent you DM's definitely big fan of the team wonderful content an tech tips
Our boy made it!
Wtf wtsysgshshwhwhwhw linussssss
honestly, very impressive way to get clicks. seeing linus on the tonight show headline and ive never clicked on a video so fast in my life. worth it
Dude. Linus! Yes! I've never been this stoked about a late night guest. He deserves it!
LinusTechTips on Fallon wtf 😭😭
So cool Linus! This is awesome.
THE MF GOAT
3:58 you know… a few more inches would be nice actually 😂
he wasn't kidding.
I really missed the lttstore plug when Jimmy mentioned his backpack
seeing Linus outside of youtube is crazy!!!
Wtf Linus. 2025 bingo is fucked
I like the color-changing glasses but 540$ us is a bit much.
This is going to make Junkyard Wars even harder now
What😂
why is there no link in the description to Ltt tho??
I love how Linus went too hard in the begining and then adjusted his speed mid sentence to match Jimmy's tempo
Linus on Jimmy's with Bad Bunny wasn't on my 2025 Bingo Card
Still fucking weird :D watched him for 15years+ 😂😂😂
Standing ovation, for anyone who could watch Jimmy say "wow" three times in a row with his mouth open.
Not sure this is Linus.. he didn't drop anything.
Bad bunny and LTT on jimmy fallon was not on my fucking Bingo card for 2025 lmaooo
hes so excited, im happy for him
Linus Killed it, We know he was nervous, but he played the excited Nerdy kid at Show n Tell very well!
Genuinely think an AI could to a better job than jimmy Fallon. would come across more interested in who they are interviewing.
i love that this show opened up to something completely new for them. Props to LTT!
Linus is super nervous here lol.  Talking at 200 wpm.
I think Linus is nervous lol
Linus has provided plenty of help over the years. Thank you!
Love that most of the comments here are LTT peeps 🤣🤣
amazing
Linus looks like Steve Irwin showing the animals when he presents the gadgets
Why does this exist?
* Jimmy asks question about what his most asked tech question is.  ** Ignores question and then proceeds to glaze himself about how big an inspiration he is to so many people.  Sigh. Please never again.
Jimmy loves people that don't follow the rules. Like Luigi?😂
sponsored by Honey
This was so good I had to watch it twice! LTT!!!
I was worried for Linus until he started ripping what he loves.
Yooooooo our boys on TV!!!
quick reminder all of it was made  by men
"enfinshincy"
seeing bad bunny and linus in the same room wasn't on my 2025 bingo list.
😮 this is so surreal
Its funny to see linus giddy and nervous for once. That intro lels.
This should be a show segment everynow and then.
Love to see Linus!
WHAT?@"??$?F@?@?? LINUS HERE???? LLESS GOO
Jimmy knows "waifu".
Linus is giving off some serious 12 year-old just shotgunned a 12-pack of Mt Dew before a gaming session vibes. Haven't seen that kind of nervous histaria since the early days.
Great show. Felt like Jimmy didn't know what to do with Linus lol.
His nervousness makes it even better. 🎉
I really thought when he said “I see you brought a backpack” bro was gonna plug lttstore
most nervous guest i’ve ever seen on a tv show
Linus has gone Hollywood. 😮
Linus is wearing makeup?
He does have thick thighs
I'm so proud of Linus right now!
Yaaaaaaaàs
Great Linus! My favorite youtuber! Quite useful appearance in this show I think
He is slightly nervous lol
Linus in stage makeup is great
This videos feels illegal
Steve Irwin of tech
half a million in 9 hours, that's Linus baby!!
LTT is gonna blow up these comments. lol ❤
linus explaining a "waifu" to bad bunny and jimmy fallon was  not on my 2025 agenda
No plugg for either backpack or lttdotstore? Must have been left on the cutting room floor
Your on TV! And im only seeing it because its on Youtube.
Linus the GOAT
The socks with sandals 😂 such a Linus thing to wear on TV
Poor guy, he seems extremely nervous
This was awesome! I've been watching Linus for a LONNNNGGGG time and to see him thrive on live TV like this is just too cool. Linus is in his element for sure!
Heart must’ve been beating like a rabbit’s
We got LTT on The Tonight Show before GTA 6
Great segment. Also fun to see Linus get star struck.
The grand daddy of tech tips
Was waiting for him to embarass himself, but he didnt
WAIFUUUUUUUUU XD
crazy how they have exactly double the amount of subs linus has
Damn, he is on a late show like a real celeb. Legitimately impressive.
Hahaha he's so nervous
Where is Fernanda Torres? Winner best performance by a female actor in a motion Picture-Drama
Love Linus, whos tf is bad bunny and kimmel is dreadful
The color changing glasses are sick! 🤩
Much love to the tonight show for letting us nerds have a voice on your show. 😂❤🥰
Who is the bad bunny guy?
Bad Bunny is like **Impressed in Spanish**
...it's not an ai video? huh.
The Jack Hanna of Tech....lol.
Kinda bizarre how Linus is ok with just being a salesman to the public on his first nationally televised appearance...
The missed opportunity for him to call in the ads with a "segue to our sponsors"
Jimmy gets himself a waifu.
Good job Linus!
chat we got linus on live tv before gta 6
Linus now if you don't go to conan podcast i'll hate you fo rest of my life.
Ok Linus...after the prototype  affair on last year...we now u "don´t now the rules". Anyway cool interview...solid. Just stay away from the sugar, coffe and energt drinks BEFORE the next interview.
Glad to see late night TV and my favorite YT channels coming together ❤
Cool gadgets, nice to see Linus in some IRL stuff however... Thou shalt never explain what a "waifu" is to normies on TV. It's just not done and it's unbecoming.
Nooooooo Benito que hiciste 4:30 el Touch ID 🪪 con la rodilla del dedo
This drop was very unexpected...  ...like that one $10,000 CPU he dropped a while back. 😃
Linus' desperate redemption tour is hilarious.
Look at Linus, helping small content creator like Jimmy and Bunny
Linus went on Tonight Show to shill a laptop....how embarrassing....
Robert Talking
Longtime LTT fan here, so proud of Linus!
3:52    Natural born salesman right there.
As an European can I ask who is this Jimmy Fallon?
Excellent job Linus! I never thought I'd see you on Fallon.
awesome job Linus!
What in the world is this crossover 😭
I knew this dude was a sell out congratulations on being on a show no one watches.
I’m amazed Linus didn’t drop anything
a tip of tecology in the tonight show. verry proud of you linnus.
Kinda weird seeing ppl act like they care about these interesting techs they probably dont appreciate.
Linus needs to be a regular showcasing new tech.
Lines + Jimmy + Bad Bunny, was not on my bingo cargo for 2025.
Linues sex tips back at it again.
I love CES, not for all the new tech, but, for the fact that a lot of companies will now put last years best tech on sale for clearence. The way Jimmy looks at the lenovo when Linus pulls it out is so funny. Like, "c'mon man, a laptop?"
Nicely rehearsed.
the make up....
Why
I never seen Linus so nervous, this is awesome.
Only 9 hours, and Linus is pulling in 2x as many views as major, world famous celebrities.   They should make Linus a yearly guest after each CES, just to show off a couple cool tech products.    I also noticed the mention of the handheld being powered by AMD.  That was some quick marketing there Linus.  Making sure AMD keeps funding your Tech upgrades!
This was awesome. Keep sending Linus to other events and have him come back with toys to share. Once Linus's nerves settled, you could tell he is a true professional. I started following his YouTube channel.
Linus did a good job, hope he does more tv performances in the future
Bro jimmy Fallon show is now hosting YouTubers? This show is dead.
Love my Mr tech tips make sick jokes haha
what a huge win for linus, LTT and all of his fans <3
Bravo, Linus. Bravo. You settled into that really well. I cannot have been easy at all.
Much Love Linusn
Linus is a great entertainer!
wow Linus is shaking...he is too excited...
who tf is this?
This time Linus IS the sponsor
I love that linus is a loose dog with no script to rely on. He’s so excited and so nervous.
I totally thought this was ai generated, like linus on a talk show and feat Bad bunny? Wtf
That laptop is so stupid.
That was fantastic! Linus did such a good job. Hope the tonight show takes more online personalities onto its show
I thought bad bunny was a girl
He’s so nervous 😂 you did great Linus
Crazy collab, never thoughts I'd see linus on the Tonight show
He Sounds so nervous
No one even knows linus outside of tech lol.  The audience was bored as hell
Nunca jamás en mi vida pensé que iba a ver un crossover entre Linus, Jimmy y Bad Bunny. Esto es increíble
did not expect this lmao
The dude behind jimmy made me way more nervous than vicariously sitting in Linus’s shoes 🤣
Where's the segue to our sponsor?
Linus? Good one!
Can you make this a regular thing now please get Linus every year after CES so he can show us some cool tech 😎 I’m definitely buy those 2 glasses
Linus is torqued. He doesn't realize that some of us think Jimmy and Bad Bunny are the lucky ones.
Linus once a week on Fallon to show us the latest tech please
Jimmy was like: finally, a screen that can fit my junk! ... wait.
Love Linus but this feels so scripted
what the fuck 😭😭😭
He's so fucking pumped. Lol
No segue :/
Linus sounds super nervous during this lmao
God, i now remember how unfunny jimmy is
Wow, LTT on fire and gosh Linus is NERVOUS! Congrats Linus and thank you for creating content for us for 10+ years.
first time they invite tech guy on talk show
5:24 BB was feeling himself in those glasses lol
This was great!!! Jimmy should have a Linus segment every week!
Good job Linus
work done...  few inches... jimmy's face 👀 iykyk
What a man! The nerves, the crowd, the spotlight and still smashed it! Great Job Linus you're a real inspiration
Wild to see Linus on Jimmy Fallon. funny as hell.
OMFG LINUUUUSSSSSSSS.
Look ma! He's on real tv!
Those glasses on BBs face went on to be President.
Brilliant! Our boy smashed it.
Linusss
linus rules
Honestly I never thought about seeing Linus here. Work hard guys, sky is the limit.
No f'in way.
Linus Sebastian Shows Jimmy and Bad Bunny a Tech Tip
**Looks down at Linus' shoes** WHAT ARE THOOOSE 🙈
Didn't drop anything. One star.
Damn linus got me with the few more inches joke
I was genuinely happy to see Linus on the show. You can tell he was excited and nervous, but once he got in his groove, he took control. I hope this opens up more doors for him.
@LinusTechTips being on Jimmy Fallon in 2025 was not on my bingo card.
Seeing linus so damn excited is pretty cool. Bad Bunny and those glasses are 100000% a match lmao. good pick on that one Linus
Love this 😂
This is insane. Never thought I'd see this day. Congrats linus
Where's the Segway to today's sponsor?
Not sure if I've ever seen a youtuber on late night TV, especially a tech youtuber. That is really cool!
This is an insane crossover.
Jimmy looking down at the screen as he’s playing lol
wtfffffffffff
These 2 dudes with linus should thank him for all the exposure he is giving them, good guy linus
super cool guest!!
LINUS THE GOAT
Linus on late night wow
Linus is going to become what BilelNynle became for science; you love to see it, man.
This would have been a perfect time to insert FloatPlane.
It’s crazy cause Linus is such an asshole in real life yet for some odd reason he keeps getting the spotlight. To be fair though it makes sense that of the talk show  he’d be on.  It’s. jimmy’s trash version
Here from the LTT squad! Come join us on the tech side!!!
Should bring him back every year after CES and have him show off tech from the convention
Jimmy needs a regular segment where Linus brings in new tech like this and just geeks on it.
Congrats Linus 👏🏼
I’m so happy for him but was getting second hand anxiety for him! But he nailed it 🎉
must be slow news day if they had to get our boy Linus on the show
I hope this becomes an annual visit, post-CES.
That's my boy 😢
What in the world is this collab lol
And you can get that extremely nice backpack at his online store, LTTStore!
Guys 0.5M views in 8h almost 10 time the average for Jimmy Fallon YouTube. They will invite him back! First time i watch Jimmy Fallon.
Linus is great. Jimmy Fallon still sucks
He is so likeable it's unreal. Good job Linus
wtf
👏
It's not AI, It's not AI, It's not AI?!?! xDDD
absolutely nailed it!
Linus you absolutely crushed. So cool to see you on a tonight show. How wild!
Ain streem tv lol look at the veiw count on this video compared to the others. 10x more on this.
XDDDDDDDDD never saw Linus this nervious in my life, i'd love it
No segway to our sponsor?
This is the crossover I didn't know I needed.
Why don't you talk about how you nearly ruined a new startup by lying about them?
Scripted for business.
Everyone need to give the guy a break on being a little nervous I know I would be on tv but he found his element once the tech started love the show.
When i jear tech, I wanna see MKBHD!
DUDE I LOVE THIS!!!
Congratulation to Linus and the the entire team at the studio. Bro, you made it years ago, you are king and these things are just confirmations. Keep it up.
lmao "no background whatsoever" that explans a lot. I wonder how much he paid for this spot lmao
So weird seeing our YouTuber up there lol mind tripping
Linus is amazing! Thanks for doing this bit!
I was waiting for him to shill his backpack the whole time lmao
Fallon seems to hate his job
Boys we got him here let's go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s gooooooooo
El combo de Conejo Malo y Señor Linus Sebastian no me lo esperaba para 2025… o ningún otro año. Pero es bienvenido 😌
lmao the perfection of such a mid show having such a mid guest is serendipitous.
Man seeing OUR 🇨🇦 boy up on stage like that 😭 what a proud moment for all of us 🤓 but more importantly 🇨🇦   Felt emotional watching this.
OMG LINUS!!!!
Congrats LTT and Linus!  Well deserved!
It's the first I see Linus nervous on camera haha
Proud to see you in the bright lights Linus
Linus in tonight show ❤❤
linus is the best
A few inches would be nice...
My favorite tech tuber and my favorite artist on the same stage, qho woulda thunk it
That's mad
Teaching the normies how cool tech has gotten.
god damn Linus finally made it to the big time
Here for that Linus hype!!! seeing him nervous was not something i ever expected haha
I have never heard anyone referred to Linus plurally 😅 Linuses
Linusss
Linus on TV? What?! Oh man you can feel the excitement from him at the beginning
Congrats to Linus. Bro finally made it.
Poor guy seemed so nervous but he did great!
Loved this segment. Bad Bunny, please come more often.
Nice to see the best techtuber becoming more widely known! Should have taken Anthony with him, just to sit next to him in complete silence.
I reckon Jimmy should have Linus on once or twice a year.
First time I have ever seen Linus uncomfortable. He was so nervous.
2:17 xDDDDDDDDDDD
Never watching another show now that you had linus respect
Let me just say this, whichever company/ies thought of this from CES is an advertising mastermind. - Getting the biggest Tech nerd on YT in front of a worldwide audience to display your products, genius. (I assume it was companies from CES that orchestrated this, as I assume LTT in itself (sadly) doesn’t have the pull to get on Jimmy Fallon on their own)
All scripted .. so cringe
bad bunny and linus in the same room is so amazing!!! ahhhhh que cabron mano!
GET IT GET IT LINUS!! THAT'S OUR BOY!! THAT'S OUR BOY!!!!!
Yoo Linus has the best enegry ngl
Bad Bunny actually seemed impressed with everything and Fallon seemed like he couldn’t careless but tried playing it off and Linus performed great
He killed it out there 👏👏
This is not what I was expecting to see in my feed this morning.
In what Multiverse am I in?
So cool to see our Tech legend joining the show 😎
Awesome interview with Linus Sebastian!!! Cool new technologies!!!
Holodeck finally
This was great. Some things from CES are like magic, even if impractical.
And the segway to our sponsor?  Best use of AI i've seen so far
Bad Bunny being there is random.
This looks like a 2017 interview due to Linus' lack of beard
Appearing on TTS just took 25 years off Linus's age.
I love LTT.  Been watching them for years!
This is such a special moment for tech Lol
I'm kind of surprised that when the backpack was mentioned Linus didn't mention where you could purchase one of those backpacks
Nervous fanyboy-Linus is my new favourite.
Ufff the myth the legend, Linus in TV :D
you can tell Loinus is a little bit nervous lol
Love Linus, man
Bad bunny? Sounds like a cheesy porn name
Linus getting SUPER nervous and spastic is HILARIOUS to watch!
We got Linus being besties with bad bunny before GTA 6
I love real nerds like this. Don’t do drugs. Don’t drink. Just so hyped about what he does.   I have no clue who bad bunny is. I thinks he does music. I’m just a nerd.
Was waiting for "And here is our Segway to our sponsor" 😂
And just like that the days of Linus shopping for groceries anonymously are over.
I wish the whole segment made it to the live show last night but glad to see the rest here online. :) Yes Linus was a bit nervous but once he got into it he mostly hit his stride. Well done!
Oh wut Linus x Talk Show Big moves
I'm a big nerd at heart. It's really cool to see Linus on Jimmy Fallon.
Way to go Linus!
i'm so so so much happy for linus.
2:38 damnnnn 😮
Bad bunny and Linus becoming besties was not on my bingo card for the year.  😂
Him and bad bunny r so cuteee
1:27 🥺🥹
not the collab I was expecting
linus jimmy tips
So freaking proud.. Almost cried.
S/O to LTT!
So who on Jimmy's team is a mad Linus fan? Jimmy?
Fucking love Linus!  bad bunny was affraid linus was p diddy. XD
Just look at number of views comparing to other videos uploaded in the same time😮
WTF is this an alternate universe?
Why is he going on all these talk shows all of a sudden?
Damn. Jimmy looking old and irrelevant.
He has make up on. Wow.
wait! where can I get that backpack, he didn't mention it!
Was waiting on the Quick Bits....er...Quark Barks....eh, next time. Great job, Linus!
Make this a regular segment. Have Linus come on and show Jimmy and his guest neat tech.
"Who the f is that guy" - Connor McGregor
Jimmy and baboni most of the time: 😟?
GOOOOOOO LINUS
Bro this is one thing u really never thought was possible, Linus and Bad bunny on the same video, wtf !
Weird ahh crossover
Wow this is amazing, go LTT🔥
I was so disappointed by how brief and rushed the segment felt live, this extended cut is way more what we the audience were expecting and I for one appreciate this version so much more.
I feel like a proud dad watching Linus on Jimmy Fallon 😆
Congratulations Linus 👏🥳👏🥳👏
Sounds like Linus's voice is finally braking. Maybe it will deepen
Linus is so fucking stoked, I love it!!
At 1:51 , Linus farts
Nice backpack plug!!!
This was great to see, thought I would miss it. Amazing to see Linus bridge the gab of YouTube and Tv🔥🔥🔥
Seems so nervous
I dont think this is linus most probably they found a body double i do not wanna believe this is the same Linus
WOW
No framework laptop?
LINUS DID GREAT! LETS GOO WWWWW
Nice to Linus on the Show ❤️
6:22 they're open to preorders, for $599. But they have cheaper models, like their Air model is $197.
i literally have second hand anxiety for him and have to watch this in small pieces LOL
“Linus’ Tech Tips are on YT” uh buddy, so are you?
Wow, Linus helping out smaller channels for a change!
No offense but who the fuck is Jimmy fallon
First had to use a tech tip to activate VPN to even be able to see this from my location. Well done Linus, though the first minute is better watched at like 75% speed 😄
I stayed up way to late to watch this and they cut it short on air night last night.  So glad that they published this! Great interview Linus and Jimmy/Bad Bunny!
lol linus on tv congrats man
no segue? no shout out to LTT store? No dBrand reminding us that there are lifts in the chairs? This must be a 'real tv' production, even though I am watching it on YouTube....
Linus was really amazed to meet Bad Bunny 🤣
Segment was way too short, but loved getting to see Linus on Fallon!
Awesome job Linus. I hope they bring you back many many more times.
I see a lot of you really like Linus, but don't you ever get the 'completely unethical ego maniac' vibe from him?
Wtf. I didn't have this on my bingo card.
This is a freaking fever dream lmao
Doesn't even look like Linus with all the makeup on lmao In all seriousness tho, I don't even think Linus can believe he was in this situation, and you can tell he's nervous. That should say something. Linus is never actually nervous about entertaining people, but he definitely was here. Awesome he got to do this!
That audience wasn't catching what Linus was tossing.
Jimmy looks very uncomfortable and linus was nervous as hell
legit!!! THIS NEEDS TO BE REGULAR!!!! I love this so much!
Linus is a right wing hack.
As someone who's watched every LTT video for 12 years now, somehow this hits different. I know it's kinda para-social but I feel genuine pride, seeing him on TV interacting with one of the all time greats of late night. Unreal.
Such a great segment! Congrats, Linus! (and LTT!) 🎉
dude! gay bunny its so dumb, he doesn t even know how to speak english,  and not even spanish. ! XD. his lyrics ar like for kindergarden dumb adults. XD
LTT!! So proud of u!!!
So where is the glasses? Lmao
Linus is SO EXCITED to be on Jimmy Fallon, it's adorable... also... dude brought a gaming PC on National TV LOL
This was more interesting than some celebrities...  That says a lot about TV and its programs and hollywood, or I just have high expectations🤔
"Wai... fu?" Oh, Jimmy, my sweet summer child.
I first saw Linus reviewing items on a plastic fold out table at his parents house. Here we are now
Linus is so nervous, it's so endearing. You've got this, Linus!
How does fallon even have a following
For real? Linus? Lib's must have lost the election...
Is this ai linus lmao why is he on tv lol
WE GOT LTT TV BEFORE GTAVI
I was waiting for Linus to drop something. 😅 Congrats on being on Fallon! Been an LTT viewer for years and this feels surreal.
Ladies and Gentlemen, he made it.
Man they chopped the hell out of this sequence in my area.  That's a better extended cut.  Let's go baby
Wow, he didn't drop anything..
Linus made me watch normal Tv.....eh....
What is this?!?!
This is absolutely crazy!! I've been watching Linus since around 2008/2009. It's just amazing to see one of the OG YouTubers still creating, but even better to see how big and successful LMG has become. I'd also echo that it is actually incredible to see Linus nervous in front of a camera, but you handled it amazing. I've done live broadcast, both in front of camera talent and as a camera operator - it's way more intense than people realise when the floor manager starts counting everyone down.   Shocked to hear no 'LTT STORE DOT COM' 😏
Socks with sandals and a penis joke. Linus in true form 🤣
Look at that! Jimmy Fallon on Linus tech tips!   I was wondering when TV programming was going to catch up
Where is the plug for lttstore?
Very funny! Love the idea of the segment! Just like having a personality that comes in showing strange/cool/cute animals, have Linus come in showing off strange and cool tech.
Yes, LTT!
Why is this Linus so nervous? Isnt he used to be on camera? What an amateur total
Thanks for having Linus on!! Been watching him for years and his channel has always brought me comfort and enjoyment!
I've never seen Linus so excited! Love it!! Kinda shocked he didn't squeeze in an L T T store DOT com though!
LTT is a celebrity, but his content is famously inaccurate. It's just infomercials. Digital Ronco.
Linus has evolved to his shiny final form
This needs to be a regular thing.
This is the most surreal thing ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Glad to see Jimmy finally made it.
omg, they made him brush his hair :O amazing
Linus with the come up. Love to see it.
He is so nervous even I'am getting nervous from watching the show
all of them like a kids playing hehe
Just stfu! You`re doing it just for the money.
“See, now look at this screwdriver and water bottle”.
Thank you for the tutorial! I received USDT in Trust Wallet and saved the recovery phrase: 『pistol daughter jewel spawn best noise exact concert recycle march drift nose』. How do I withdraw it?
Linus being nervous shows how humble he is. Well done Linus 👍
MY GOAT.
never in my life i would expect to see linus on tonight show
The glasses are amazing
Absolutely love this 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Do you think Bad Bunny kept the sunglasses? I hope so.😂😂
I woke up and thought I was half asleep when i saw a thumbnail of Jimmy and Linus with Bad Bunny
So these talk shows are finally having on the people we *actually* watch. I guess their dinosaur brains are finally catching up.
We made it boys
No new sega Genesis?
We made it boys!
they should've used a  pic of his macaroni hair
Linus nervousness shows his love for his career. I appreciate seeing it so much.
It's funny to watch Linus be so anxious you can hear it in his voice 😆
Linus - did you really wear sandals with socks on the tonight show???
I was disappointed that there was no segway to your sponsor
My 3 kinda peeps in one setting
Where do I check out today's sponsor?  Something's not right.
Makeup artist did Linus dirty.
Do they give guests ecstacy before appearances?
Linus y Bad Bunny juntos? 😮
Man Ai videos have gone crazy! lol
Liking and commenting so you can bring Linus back.
Oh great, as if that guy's ego needed to get any bigger.
Bring back Linus, i love that guy
LTT on Fallon????
It's 8:30 the next morning and this video has over 460k views already. That's over 5 times the views of the bad bunny video so far (and it released later).  As a long time LTT fan I'd love to see Linus randomly pop back on (Rhett and Link style), maybe for a back to school laptop roundup or a Christmas tech gift guide.  Love the video, congrats to the whole LTT team who ran around precuring the goodies from CES vendors.
Bro linus u on coke?
Making this a regular segment would be right up there with the Robert Irwin animal segments for me. And tech companies would love this.
Bro what universe is this? 😅
Why am I watching this like a proud uncle? 😂 I’m younger than Linus
Linus Sebastian? I genuinely thought his surname was Techtips.
This the most Canadian guest I've ever seen
Bad Bunny 👎🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
LOL. Come a long way Linus. Good job bro.
W LTT collabs this year went crazy
3:58 well played lmfao
Wait Linus has a last name?
"Humanoid Waifu robots that you can " *Wink* "Interact with"   Sucks that that joke fell flat.  Come one Crowd,  Not even one Iota of recognition?  Good Job Jimmy for circling back to it!  Awesome Job Presenting Linus, you Killed it!!
Really interesting to see a nervous Linus. It's amazing how even successful people can be just barely out of their element and remind us that they're human. In truth, LTT has higher viewership than The Tonight Show. Seriously, LTT has roughly 1.5M daily views vs TTS 1.3M viewers per episode, with those numbers growing increasingly inverse over time. But "real TV" is something that we grew up with and respect, even idolize.
I wasn't expecting to see Linus at the Jimmy Fallon show 😮
Linus seems so fake!
Not usually a Jimmy Fallon watcher, but gotta support someone in traditional media appreciating Linus. Appreciate you, Jimmy Fallon.
who is the guy on the right? Another host?
niiice
that first laptop Linus showed was like the stretching room on The Haunted Mansion ride!
Is Linus excited or nervous ?
Linus wearing TV make up is so weird
When they brought up the backpack I was shocked it wasn't a plug for the LTT store.
Be careful Linus that's the Devil's playground...
Finally Linus has a spotlight on the late show after all these years!!
Where did he got such a nice backpack?
Man, that audience was lame af. You could tell they were checked out because they didn't know who Linus was.
Linus just made being a tech reviewer cool, our careers are going to blossom now haha
HIS LAST NAME IS SEBASTIAN?
Who’s here because of Linus? 😂
Never seen Linus that nervous but this is the Victory of the Geeks.
He never ages.
Great job Linus, started nervous but relaxed as you got into it and did a fantastic job picking products that are exciting to a non techie audience.
Linus absolutely killed it. The GOAT continues to raise the bar.
Pero y badbunny alli??
Benito mouthing "Diablo Cabron" at the end had me rolling! 😂
Wr got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6
Bro is me like a child 😂 love em!
Mis dos mundos chocaron coñaso jaja el Linus y el conejo
I can’t help it but to be a bit teary eyed, watching Linus over the years getting to this well deserved point makes me fuzzy inside! Congrats man!!
Knocked Loose & now Linus!!! Gah I love you Jimmy ❤
That was so wholesome. Loving that tech is getting the attention it should be getting.
linus segment had more than views than all of the other clips from this episode combined!
I am so proud of Linus coming so far! But is anyone else who watches more YouTube than TV these days appalled at how Jimmy Fallon acts? I feel like they think the audience is really that dumb because of how he responds and the childlike canned laughter from the audience during moments that dont require it feel odd. Maybe I've been out of the TV game awhile
Linus on Jimmy Fallon is crazy but so well deserved. A legend
Who is the slightly more diverse guy next to Fallon? Are they prepping a replacement?
Linus is the IT version of Steve Irwin
Multiple millions of view, yet he is so humble and so nervous that you can hear it in his voice and see in his body language. Love how genuine Linus is.
What in the multiverse
Never thought I would see Linus and Bad Bunny in the same room ever... I loved every second of it lmao
It's great to see Linus there, and also shows you that he is so passionate about what he does - even though he was super nervous at the beginning, when tech goes in, he just flows with it like always!
WE GOT LTT ON JIMMY FALLON FOR GTA VI
He should have used the hard r
Absolute legend
Wow Linus has the most viewed vid on this channel in weeks. Not a surprise tbh
For anyone wondering at 7:35 Bad bunny lips read "El diablo... Diablo..." which is our spanish way to say "Daaaaam"
bro crushed it
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon with his socks and Sandals, before GTA 6. That's insane!!
Amazing to see Linus on the show Fan since 2014
the glasses at the end are something I've been saying for awhile. VR doesnt interest me, but having a visor that's legit just a screen, seems like an obvious use case. No need for ultrawide, or big screen.
I live like 40 minutes from their headquarters. Proud of this guy.
Damn I thought this was a deepfake when i saw this pop up
If Linus doesn’t drop anything it’s not an authentic ltt video
I was waiting on the segueway to the sponsored ad
Ohh it's Linus and I thought what could they talk about, halfway through the video I was laughing my ass off 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Linus  seems so different compared to his channel
Que sorpresivo ver llegar el youtuber canadiense con casi 15 millones de suscriptores en Jimmy fallon
The smile on Linus when Jimmy mentioned his backpack. Every LTT viewer will understand it
Cringe 🤮
Holy crap it’s Linus!! 👍🏻
Jimmy don't know who Linus is lol ..
We made the right person famous he deserves to be there😭
Linus looks really nervous...
That last item, though. Take my money!
This is the best timeline 🔥
Had to go to sleep early because of work, so I watched this morning. Super excited for Wanshow this Friday!!
the way they shook hands at the end was super sweet
Jimmy tech tips
With the sandals. He never disappoints.
Congrats Linus!
Love how Linus still sounds like a teen, complete with cracking voice.
Linus!!!
I'm glad seeing Linus getting so far! i've been following him since 2010 more or less and im so proud! but you know what else im proud about? about this segue, to our sponsor!  Dbrand! and their dark plates for PS5, use code SHORTLINUS for 15% discount
Linus made it!!!   We got Linus on TV before GTA 6 & HL3!!!
Bad Bunny mouthed "diablo cabron" when he got the glasses on 😂😂😂 basically a "holy shit!"
linus, what the shit? why were you surrounded by these bums?
Linus really do be the only funny one up there huh?
This is such a weird moment 😂😂. But SUPER proud of you Linus! This is definitely cool to see for a guy I grew up watching. Awesome to see how far you’ve come man
Jimmy definitely knew what a waifu was before this
Genuinely amazing job. Nothing more needs to be said. 👏👏👏
This man has been part of my life for SO long, and as a young nerd turned professional nerd, it fills me with joy and motivation to see him do his thing in front of (and be appreciated by) an ever growing audience
tbh linus is acting the exact same way i would if i was on tv, this is so unbelievably cool to me!!!
linus we are so pround ;,-(
Was he that nervous at the beginning or just playing the bit?
Wby woukd you even talk to Jimmy, such a clown.
This is crazy, love it
The LTT Store shoutout is meme in the Linus community... that's all
Jimmy is too hung over for Linus energy. And why is BB there?
I  feel the backpack should have gotten shown off
Linus was definitely nervous at first but he got into his groove once he got into the tech stuff in his backpack
Only here for LTT !
Seeing Linus explain what a "waifu" is to Jimmy Fallon wasnt on my 2025 list but here we are
So great to see Linus helping out other creators. Hopefully this jimmy Fallon guy hits the big time
Why do I feel like a proud parent right now. It make me so happy to see him so excited/nervous
Linus looked so excited ^-^ great job!!!
This video is called "Simping tech cranked up to 11 for 2 idiots and their trained seals"
Congrats linus❤
No segue to a sponsor?
Linus , you chose the right things to bring , they were amazed . We could see how nervous you are , but after hundreds of hours watching you on You Tube , you shouldn't be nervous anymore .
no sponsor ad before and after linus has falllen i repeat linus has fallen
What in the crossover event??
Look at Linus man, so inspirational
Who is Bad Bunny. I’m here for Linus Tech Tips
Linus Sebastian, Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny, the crossover no one saw coming.
Wtf is this crossover episode. I love it 😂
From a business standpoint this is good marketing. And a little more luck he'll be right back to where he was. Content creators have their ups and downs.Some a lot more disastrbut.The good ones find their way back.
First saw Linus in Intel Training videos while working at Best Buy. Over the years I thought I was just getting used to his voice, so it seemed less high pitched, but I guess its more a product of nerves and excitement.
Lol bad bunny pocketing the glasses😅
Great to see Linus being asked questions on and taking about tech and not just on his business.  Btw… go buy his backpack.
Sneaky backpack product placement
This is BANANAS!
This feels like that old segment where the biologists bring exotic animals, only this time it's the IT guy bringing weird prototype tech. This should be a recurring segment.
Considering that just one of Linus videos get more views than jimmy fallons is what’s funny
Linus made it!
damn Linus made it! so proud of LTT.
It's weird seeing Linus on Kimmel. Almost like it's not real.  Way to go Linus, you hit the big screen.
WHAT THE HELL
Totally unexpected collab. This widens LTT's reach to normies and allows him to finally tell other people what the heck he does for a living more easily.
How many double expresso's did he have? He is hyped to the max. Nervous off the chart, probably thinking he ruined it a bit, but he nailed it. Well done Linus. That was actually the energy that was needed.
aha never thought i would see linus on here, aha this was awesome.
Linus so nervous 😂 Glad to see he's made it to real TV
Oh god, he's even wearing his infamous socks with sandals.
Les go linus ❤😂
Linus has his nervous voice on. Lol
Linus the GOAT!
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6
Nightmare blunt rotation
And now a word from our sponsor " fake laugh" Ever feel in need for fake laugh?
Let's go Linus!!!
Goof to see LTT helping these guys get some views.
LTT ON FALLON
He was so excited and so nervous. Jimmy tried so hard like he always does but he had to be internally thinking who the hell booked this guy?
Bad Bunny looking at him like: *”Should I overclock my 14900K? Just built custom liquid cooling and I think I should boost my clock speed to 6Ghz?”*
Everyone forgot how he took someone's prototype and sold it? Linus is a terrible person.
Congratulations to Jimmy Fallon on landing Linus Sebastian as a guest. You have made it big time now!
Linus on the tonight show definitely was not on my bingo card
He was so excited and so nervous. Jimmy tried so hard like he always does but he had to be internally thinking who the hell booked this guy?
Wish I could've watched the original segment on air, but I'll do with this.
Goat
if this doesn't have a segue I'm not watching it
Linus in this show before GTA 6🤣   . . . Sorry Mandatory Comment.
Congrats Linus, you did great!
Hey Linus
Good job Linus 👍🏻🤣
Linus on the Tonight Show? Without a segue? My mind just crashed.
Somebody gave him too much coffee.
What's funny is that Jimmy Fallon majors in Computer Science
Nothing NEW just an another REVIEW video.
who is this scrub talking?
Good job Linus! that was funny
Linus bitting his tongue not to say lttstore
Look nerds, Linus is on tv!!!! :) this is awesome ltt. And not even one word from our sponsors?!
This is so random
Oh god, they put so much make-up on linus, they made him look horrible
Millenials and older: Who's that guy next to Jimmy? GenZ and younger: Who's that guy next to Linus?
what the
Bad bunny totally snarfed those glasses!😅
I was kind of a mid level Bad Bunny fan before this but man, I might have to start giving him more streams on Spotify 😂
Is this Ai?
This is clearly a childhood dream
Now this is something I didn't expect.
I’ve watched many hundreds of LTT and WAN videos.  I have legitimately never heard of Bad Bunny.  I thought it was the chick that says “catch me outside”?
this is so cool, i have been watching Linus for years
Cringe overload. Bunch of creeps.
The ahdh come out big time and it was superb, go on Linus.
Absolute RAW unscripted Linus! Brilliant. We need him to do a kids show or a kids channel on his YouTube. His energy is contagious
Linus is so genuine, such a fanboy and I love it
Man, this is unreal! We can see Linus’ excitement, and I’m here for it! Congratulations Linus :)
Good for him man. I hope this level of exposure solidifies his passion for tech even more.
Whaaaaat Linus didn't drop any of the goods! He's really leveled up :)
As a Boricua Nerd and seeing Bad Bunny and Linus in the same room is fucking wild its like a alternate timeline. I own a LTT backpack.
He just seems so nervous
Now thats my youtuber!, lets go Linus!!
Duuuuude, I’m so giddy just watching Linus be passionate about all that he’s talking about… And also having “Waifu” uttered in live television 😏
They've been making wearable displays and I've been wanting to try but every time some one comes and then dies in a way, even Apple. So in a sense not very highly likely, though i want it, not full day on but some hours at most in a day, just to get that feel. Still guts, it takes guts to keep making those
jimmy was pretty awkward for this one. Linus was full of energy!
They should have brought on the toy fire truck as a special guest.
Invite this dude again
Awesome segment, loved seeing the cool tech being showcased.
"Humanoid waifu robots that you can interact with" 😳🥵
Linus was so nervous lol
that was so good
Bad bunny yoinked those color changing glasses 😂
linus is just ours when showing some cool stuff to some 😂❤ love it
A wild! Linus appears!😂👍
Okay this is definitely not what I expected to see this morning 😂 weird but cool crossover
I dont like jimmy they are all so fake and to see one of the realest people on youtube have to play off that hurts me.
I have never seen Linus so excited. Well done man
Linus looked a lot like Elijah in here
Oh, This is  new.  Congrats Linus!
The contrast between Linus and the other two! Linus has about 1000% more humor and personality. If you ask me, they should be guests on HIS show!
The…sssegue???🥺
Hell yeah! Great to see Linus in an old media staple. Although I expected a sneaky segue to the lttstore 😂
I almost didn’t recognize Linus with his hair combed 😂
The Bad Bunny/LTT collab is two of my worlds colliding that I never thought would!
Holly Crap! Who are those two guys with Linus??!
Hell yeah Linus!!!
What a Collab 😂😂
You could tell linus was stoked to be here, definitely tell hes nervous but thriving
My Linus showing off tech AND THE CAKE GODDAM
Sheshh looking good linus
Represent us nerds, Linus! Great to see you up there.
Never in a million years did I expect to see bad bunny and linus in the same room wow
bro the joy in linus’s eyes the whole time. he loved this.
This is so weird to see Linus on jimmy fallon. It would have been better if Denis randomly joined
Linus took too much Vyvanse for this interview 😂
Linus was so nervous and made it sooooooooooo boring. Almost no reaction from the crowd.
Linus did awesome
The LTT comment section where no one expected to see it - watching this is total cognitive dissonance. And isn't that the LTT backpack? Also when Jimmy didn't know what a waifu was - Aaaaahahahahaaa I'm laughing with the same nervous energy that Linus is. This..... is.......Peak......Internet.....
You were funnier than Jimmy Fallon but I can't really call they an accomplishment 😂
<3 Linus
No Dbrand jokes sponsor? damn
Linus great stuff :)
...Riley?
Hey, the Tonight Show did something relevant again 😱 Been a couple decades
Linus and Bad Bunny YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
He’s geeking out and I absolutely love this for him
My name is Linus too and my dream is to meet Bad Bunny 😅
WHAT KIND OF MULTIVERSE TIMELINE AM I IN?? LINUS ON FALLON??? WHAT!??
Wish this segment was longer
Fallon looks so bored there
“And here in my bag Jimmy is a segue… TO OUR SPONSOR”
Jimmy not looking up with the screen glasses at first 😅
This is huge !!! 😮 Weird seeing Linus so nervous.
free promotion for companies lmao nah fr this is cool
LS explaining Waifus to Jimmy Fallon was not on my 2025 bingo card
I was waiting for the "babymoon" turn when he said "what happens in Vegas"
ayoooooooo soo proud of our boi linus,i'm so happy i'm giddy
Nice one Linus!!!
bad bunny con los lentes xD
Segue??
Good job Linus
This was very cool to see
Typical liberal canadian sucking up to the liberal anti-american jimmy fallace.
woa my 3rd favorite guy from the wan show, one day we can get dan on here
Never in my life I though I’d se Linus and bad bunny together 💀
This is amazing. Great segment.
Fucking cringe.
🎉
nice to see Linus at the show  💚
So Linus was the classic animal wrangler guest, but tech
I'm pretty sure that this collab is gonna make Jimmy grow his audience exponentially. Linus is such a nice guy....
WAIT WHAT
Linus shouldve dropped something during the show 😂😂
Cant believe they put this rapist on air, I gues we did elect drumpf the 34 time felon who has sex with porn stars and then refuses to pay.
Great segment
What an unusual experience to see Linus truly nervous and a bit starstruck at the beginning, before the nerdiness kicked in. Adorable!
I love it when he tries to talk about tech to no-tech people. AMD? What is that?
I knew it was going to be a good night with Linus and Benito
Linus is so jumpy in this interview.😅
This is really weird. It's like your side chick meeting your wife.
Lingus 😍😍
Lmao I love Bad Bunny behind the desk
Linus is so spastic and twitchy 😂
Damn.... Fallon finally made it eh?
Now we need Fallon to appear on WAN
thats my ellen
Linus is the man! God bless!
Missed opportunity for Linus to do the Segue
Waifu is the Japanese transliteration of the English word "wife".
I was getting to sweaty watching Linus explore with nerves, I had to take off my hoodie.
SOCKS AND SANDALS Linus never change
I cant wait till all 3 of these people are in fortnite.
You really scrapping the bottom of the barrel for guests.
how can you tell linus was excited? loud and fast talking, id say he was really excited to be there lol.
Linus showing tech like a guest from an animal show showing exotic animals
Getting on mainstream TV is when you made it big. Great job Linus and LTT!
Linus Linus Linus!
The crossover i didn’t expect
Good job Linus for not dropping any of the tech... or segue to the sponsor!!!
You can tell how nervous Linus is up front. His voice immediately reverts back to his original high pitch presentation mode. This was great though
Yikes bro, that may have been the most nervous I’ve ever seen someone on camera and you make videos twice a day.
Linus looks like he was so nervous that he decided to do a bag of coke before the interview, and Bad Bunny looks like he's completely uninterested in any of this nerd noise.
I didn't see this collab coming XD.
cant believe we got linus explaining what a waifu is to jimmy fallon before gta 6
This collaboration is unexpected 😂
haha Linus Tech Tips is on Youtube right  NOW .... :p i missed the number one tech tip of them all :   "have you tried to turn it off and then back on :p"
I really liked the image washing. It is so clear great video. Thanks steve.
Linus looks so nervous 😭 it’s adorable
Like the animal people who bring odd animals regularly….would be cool to see Linus regularly show up with odd tech.
What a weird crossover
Linus is so nervous lol, he is usually the confident guy or the guy that look down upon everyone. Anyway, nice segment.
I feel like they thought he was some amazing famous hacker who is super wicked with computers.
THIS!! I LOVE THIS!!!
although is an 8 inute AD is nice to see linus (one of us  nerds) being recognized
Make some noise for Linuuuuuuus !!! LTT for the win ! Amazing to see you here :-D
Imposter! He didn't drop anything.
Tech dad is on TV.
It's so fun to see regular people reacting to tech
Linus looks super nervous but what a cool opportunity. He did a great job.
Nice !
Awesome segment! More of this!
Linus looks embalmed
Crazy, I've been keeping up with LTT since the early days, and its insane to see him on the tonight show! Wow
Linus you absolutely killed it buddy for real hell yeah!!!
Linus overclocked his adrenaline to 169% for the show 😁
One of the best segments in the show's history.
Should be a reoccurring segment
I fuckin' love that Linus was nervous for this. He settled into it really quickly after the first minute so massive respect for performing under pressure -- The pressure we put on ourselves is always the worst.
awesome interview, GG Linus
Linus has more views than the bad bunny video they uploaded right after
So happy for him! I've watched him for years building computers and other hardware.
I didn't drink enough coffee... I'm hallucinating Linus with Jimmy Fallon 😂
Body language ❌ Hand language ✅
Big time USA TV didn't change Linus, guy still rocks his daily fit. Love seeing the nervousness start and then fade as he got comfortable talking about tech.
Linus doing podcasts and late night TV runs
Well I bet Joe Rogan now knows who Linus is
shocked he didnt plug the bag...., thats one fancy bag of holding
Who did the make up for Linus, it looks awful
This whole interview was nothing more than a segue to his sponsors... Lenovo, Camello and Xreal!!!
What’s happening rn?!
so wild to see Linus on Jimmy Kimmel thats insane
These glasses at the end look very interesting. Looking forward to the second or third generation of it.
Damn he killed it
I've never seen him this nervous lol
Great to see Linus helping out smaller creators 😂
Only here cause of LTT!!
It’s too bad he doesn’t have a good review channel. It makes sense as to why he’s on Jimmy Fallon. This is a show that denounced anyone that didn’t believe in the vaccine. Remember that.
Congrats Linus!!! I was seriously expecting a plug for that sweatshirt available at LTT shop!!! Hahaha😂
It'd be cool if there was a store where Linus could sell his merch. I'd call it something like the El-TeeTee store.
The 5 other videos posted at the same time as this one have less views combined...
Linus deserves every bit of this moment of glory. Been following linus since he started and have loved every moment of his journey.
He seemed really nervous for the first couple minutes but once he was asked some questions, Linus really eased up and got back into his element. A great performance! I know it will be something he won't ever forget.
Sick segment, couldn't tell what linus was more excited about, being there or showcasing the cool tech
Linus is the best, nice to see you in National Television
Please tell me that he wearing dad sandals with LTT's socks on the show!
Wow! that is so cool @LinusTechTips ! That excitement and nervosity in your voice was contagious !
I still kick myself as I could have been Linus. I love tech, but it's expensive to get started. I built my first machine in 2005, but I never thought about recording it as YT only started in the same year.
This is awesome
Regular Linus Text Tips filler on the tonight show! GIT  We want, nay; We DEMAND more!!!
Who the fuck is the guy next to jimmy?
So Proud of you Linus! Great Job!
linus and bad bunny ? i wasnt expecting that collab
linus sounds ai
Linus’ age suddenly reverted back to 20 again.
So many opportunities to call back to the waifu’s
Still cannot believe Linus was a guest AFTER the Costco guys (Facepalm)
It's funny seeing him so nervous when you consider he gets more eyes on him on his own channel than he ever will on TV
He's less nervous more excited
Benito se las quedó😂😂
wow..ltt got buut load og monet from lenovo now
it's really humanizing to see this guy who so many people call out of touch all the time being so incredibly nervous to be on here for an audience that realistically isn't even that much bigger than his own. it's just something about the grandness of a TV studio that'll do that to ya. Really fun to see this segment!!
watching this side of linus is unbelievable !!! all excited and jumpy and like in a different way
Ole ahí el Lunis !!! Un grande !!!❤
what drug is Linus on I want some 😅
He has so much adrenaline he can't contain himself. He handled it quite well
Linus on The Tonight Show was not on my 2025 bingo card.
Network TV is so desperate for views it brings in a anxiety ridden worst YT ever. WTF.
LinusTechTips and Bad Bunny in the same room.....? haha
He either had way too much coffee or was nervous af, or both
So cool!
Didnt expect to see luigi mangione on talk shows so soon
Fantastic job Linus! 🎉
This is so surreal, I love it
Why didn't you promote the backback on the LTT Store? 😂
what in the simulation is this?
OG Linus
What the heeeeelllllllll
dude looked like a little kid! great to see
This video is brought to you by our sponsor....
I got nervous just watching it :D
Weird to see Linus here lmao. But glad YouTubers are ending up in these places more and more
If talk shows had more guests like this I'd watch it more.
Great job Linus!
Linus looked so excited like he couldn't contain it!
Love Linus! Great Job!   First time I've watched network TV in like 5 years - who tf is bad bunny? why two hosts? thats super awkward, Jimmy was more than enough.
Love the backpack product integration
LTT? Is that like Toms Hardware but on Youtube?
besides his nervousness which is understandable, he did great. Congrats, we love you Linus
never would have seen this dude on a late show!
Sooo weird seeing Linus on jimmy.  Its cool to see him bring tech to a new audience.
WOW he is so nervous, its cute
Our Linus is all grown up now.
Nice, Linus on Fallon, good shit!
Insane blunt rotation
This episode is about people being in their discomfort zone. Linus = Scared of TV. Jimmy = Scared of Tech talk. 😂
Wan show has never seen this man. Legend way to go Linus! You sure did bring the show to them!
He really does revert back to NCIX tech tips Linus when he goes on legacy TV, huh?
You made it linus. I watched you from the beginning you made my computer geekiness explode now look at you At the fing tonight Show in my vity New York Fing Coty. Wow brother WOW congrats 👏👏
Waifu 1. a fictional character (esp from an anime cartoon) whom a person regards as a romantic partner. 2. facetious. a wife.
Wait what the fuck?????????@?@?@?@?@?
LINERVOUS! This was unexpectedly good, well done Linus, must have been quite a thrill.
Linus is worth more then both of them combined lol
In the words of George Costanza: _"This is not good! Worlds are colliding!"_
LTT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best segment on Jimmy's show ever. Need to do this with Linus every CES with a longer spot so he can show off more stuff.
No fucking way this is real
Linus with no sponsor?
Right off the bat with a failed handshake, classic Linus!
HE KILLED IT!!!
Fallon is such a boomer
Should have asked him about Honey. Linus is a slimeball.
LTT, such a cool guy
wtf is this timeline
Who is Noah 😂
Fallon wishes he can get 8 Billion views LTT is just helping the ones with the least once again
Good job Linus, great to see the success you deserve. Following you since ever and always had fun with your contents. Linus tech moments would fit perfectly into the Fallon show, honestly.
hes super nervous lmao, congrats to him.
this is amazing
I can’t believe how nervous he was
The whole video had some '90s Teleshop vibes. 😂
Dude, Jimmy Fallon? Why is Linus excited to be on such a trash tier show? Either way, glad hes happy and Im glad hes in the mainstream media now, he deserves it
Linus did so well, but you could see how the jokes meant for a techy audience instead of the general audience fell flat. They had no idea what Baldur’s Gate would be, probably had to go with something like 2K or COD or something.
Now I've seen it all
this guy invited Linux?
Where are the affiliate links to the products??? C'mon Jimmy, you have to know better than that!
Legend
10+ years watching LTT never heard Linus so nervous
I never would have expected...  It's crazy to see him actually nervous. Hair and makeup is odd. But great job my dude.
Never seen Linus nervous on camera before 😂
There's no possible way that's a real crowd in the background
That fake crowd in the background is really annoying.
Linus so nervous at the start is like when you have to give your first school presentation in class,  Nailed it later when he settled down though and talking about tech. Well done Linus, Not many people got the guts to go on tv,  I wouldn't even for a million, Probably have a heart attack.  ;)
He started off so nervous, understandably, but boy did he land it.
Is there anyone actually in the fucking crowd? The screaming they do is so unrealistic and cringe.
What a sellout...
Linus teaching millions about waifus was not on my bingo card
A very excited child of Linus came out of him.
Linus isn’t kidding about his influence. I started watching LTT back when I was in middle school and this past year graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. Without LTT I never would have considered electronics as a career path. Thank you, Linus!
Bad Bunny with Free 99 vibes lol
It started off kinda shaky, but it ended on a terrific high note ( not as high as Linus' voice at the beginning  😅), but overall, it was a very good 👌  job on "REAL TV".   I'm sure most people, even ones with millions of subs on YT, would be nervous too in front of millions of people and especially a live audience, Jimmy and bad bunny 🐰 🎉
Linus isn’t kidding about his influence. I started watching LTT back when I was in middle school and this past year graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. Without LTT I never would have considered electronics as a career path. Thank you, Linus!
Where's my lttstore plug?!
He didn't drop nothing.. i almost feel let down :p
I wish the Waifu section wasn’t cut
I've never seen him so nervous lol.
linus you made it to real tv
Our Linus did so great!
Feels strange to see linus here
The makeup made me laugh~!
It’s Linus and the power of about 100 cups of coffee 🫨🫨🫨
The nervous energy is peak. The entire comment section seems to just be LTT fans being supportive.
7:36 🐰: “diablo cabron” 🤣🤣🤣  Never in a million years would I have imagined these three in the same room 🤣🤣🤣. Greetings from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
We got Waifu on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6
If anyone doesn't know how the law of attraction works, this is a great example.
The fact linus is nervous is wild to me lol. So happy he is being repped to commercial TV.
I can't believe this day has come, we live in a simulation.
There is more white makeup on his face than you would see at an open casket viewing. I cannot believe you bottled the LTT store reference. Now, I'm off to ice my neck after nearly breaking it on the doubletake looking at the thumbnail. Excellent work.
Best place in Canada to work. Provide people with just enough knowledge to be dangerous!
I always thought his last name was Tips
LTT on prime time....wtf lol
Floatplane BTS?
WAN show is gonna be crazy this Friday.
Wait, where's the word from today's sponsor?
Haha bad bunny is in love 😀
linus is much bigger than jimmy fallon in reality
OK, I saw a picture of Linus being on the Jimmy Fallon show on Instagram and I thought it was a joke but no it’s legit.😂😂
Yup that's my goat right there
That was amazing ❤
I'm going to recommend that Linus tick 2 mg of Xanax before he does something like this again 😂
Amazing to see this, big hug from Spain Linus!!
is that Linus "Hard R" Tech Tips?
Best guest so far in 2025❤
Cringe
So, is the multiverse actually a real thing ?
We got Linus in The Tonight Show before GTA 6
Linus i love that you made it onto this show - truly i do - but you committed too hard to your bit with the Socks & Sandals. C'mon bud people get dressed for Jimmy and you rocked up peak tech nerd :P  Also - I've never seen Bad Bunny before, but he's one of those people that makes any type of sunglasses's work and im so envious of this ability.
Why’s he so nervous?   He’s got more clout than these people
Lmao linus sounds like hes about to explode. Never seen him so nervous
Our Linus omgggg
I think Linus has made it.
The most scared I've ever seen a tiny man.
🫡🇨🇦
Never thought I’d see the day where I could finally watch Linus on YouTube! Only joking, this was awesome!
its a waifu, Jimmy, a waifu as in wife
Linus  should use makeup on his Youtube videos 😂
You could see him become much more relaxed as he brought the tech out, what a surreal moment for him!
It's cool when someone who got big from the internet gets on _'real TV'._ I hope Linus' auntie is happy.
Jimmy's reactions are so flat. But holy shit. Linus nailed it. This was amazing!
Sick!
This needs to be a recurring segment!
after saying all you hear at CES is this is the future  when he ripped out the laptop starting with this i was actually dissapointed when linus didn't say is the future realy missed opertunity for some laughs
Linus man, great job and great tech pics to bring on. Segment couldn’t have went better, it was interesting with humour and cool tech that you could show off easily.   Would love to see you as a reoccurring segment every month or 6 weeks or something like that. ❤🤍❤️ from NL, Canada. 🇨🇦
The way I gasped when I saw this What the actual heck you’re actually on a late night show 😭😭😭😭
So weird seeing Linus on TTS and Jimmy pretending not to know what a waifu is.
Tight. Good showing, proud of ya, Linus. We can all tell you were a bit excited down there... In the States 😉
I hope the gamers too
Linus > Fallon & Bunny Boy
The socks and sandals joke has gone way too far omg
Shoutout Linus, he's been on his grind...
Lmao Linus talking about waifus
Does anyone feel like perhaps backstage they all bumped a line of coke? And this is linus' first time bumping coke 😅
This video is so awkward that it looks like a deepfake
cant belive linus was on Fallon and still made it look like one of his tech tipps episode
I'm just so happy for linus here.
He's wearing makeup! Hahaha. Welcome to live TV.
Are James and neanderthal Stylax on katamine?
the greatest crossover ever lol
You know you're doing terrible when executives start bringing Co-Talk show hosts 🤣
So happy for Linus ❤
He nailed the hand shakes
Dope af
You rocked it Linus
Where's the segue to the sponsor!??
Linus was freaking great, I’ve been watching him for years.
I've followed you for like 10+ years and now I'm seeing you here lol
Didn't expect that but good to see that.
Funny how he was so nervous, not his normal relaxed persona.
Old media is soooo dead its unreal
3:11 of course he brought a backpack 😂
He is so nervous it's adorable
Legacy media is desperate. No offense to Linus. I watch his videos all the time. His whole team is amazing! But 15-20 years ago this never happened and I remember them mocking YouTubers. Now look. Begging any viral people to come on the show.
iv already re watched this like 5 times.
Tech brings unimaginable wow factors
"What else have you got in that bag" "One of the best things in here, is the segue to our sponsor!"
linus was so nervous! LMFAO!! i love the guy
Yo Linus did his hair! Lol
Bad Bunny looks like a young Sadaam Hussein
bro is so comfortable and weird on youtube but too nervous on real tv 😅. i guess i would too
linus on the tv show is kinda fun this needs to happen more often  likle a tech segment
His voice is even more higher than usual lol
this channel has 32.2 million subscribers.... yet EVERY video barely reaches 50k. with the occasional 100-300k views. this video has more views in 6 hours than all other videos i managed to scroll to.  this channel botting subscribers?
Jimmy Fallon, the worst talk show host probably in history. He just oozes fake out of every pore. I'm obviously hear for Linus but 🤮
So gutted I couldn’t meet you, I heard you were at CES but it’s just way too big to spot anyone known!  For those who get the chance, CES is an experience and a half, dream come true for me after a decade!
Just as awkward as i expected him to be, beautificus
Man this was cool to see. What’s next Late Night with Linus?
My man on that 1.5x speed type shit
Congrats Linus
Happy for you, man! I would be nervous as well, but you did it!
Wat glasses are last ones?
Dude, Linus killed that, that was a fire and funny segment
Well deserved Linus, congrats for making it to TV.
Love that linus was so nervous, excited and geeked out all at the same time.
This is was so much fun!! He really gave some good Tech Tips this Linus guy! 😂
Fallon sucks but this is pretty cool to see LTT!
Dawg why did this end? I wanna keep watching more of it 😭😭
good thing he did not drop anything 😅🎉
Owww Linus is having sooo muchhhh fun! I think it’s the first time I see him this excited, that’s really nice! You deserve everything is happening to you man, congratulations!
no sponsor whattt
You made it you son of a bitch, glory to the nerds, all hail the nerd king
Linus , while super excited, nailed it. Awesome !
Linus explaining Waifus on national television...
Love Linus, hate Jimmy.
Got some real Steve Irwin vibes from Linus, at first I thought he was doing a bit, but then I saw how nervous he was. Still got them in the second half.
It was nice to see Linus so happy
Jesus Christ lol
I know canada is far away , but a segment weekly of linus would be Awesome.
I've never seen Linus so giddy
Hm.
WHAT
So great to see Linus work in an intimate setting like The Tonight Show.
That laptop is actually quite  cool
300k in 6 hours g up g up
WTF is a bad bunny and why is he calling this random guy that name?  So confused.
LINUS
Lots of nervous Linus energy on display here.
LINUS <3 !!!! Finally Jimmy gets some real stars to his show =)
Did not expect to see this when I woke up this morning. You did a great job Linus.
Awesome job Linus!!!
wow this dude is so organically prepared to be on camera
He smashed that for how nervous he was.
Linus should be a tech correspondant regular on the show!
Bad Bunny saying "diablo!" to the color changing glasses has me ROFLOL
LINUSSSSSS WOOOOOOOO
He genuinely looks so excited. It's so nice that Linus gave these two gentlemen the oppurtunity of their lives.
Wow. Seeing Linus on live television and he managed to drop nothing. What an evolutionary miracle. 😅
I literally thought this was AI Generated and thought, we're doomed, because I couldn't detect the ai weirdness lol. Congrats Linus
So good to see Linus on here. Out of his element but still nailed it. Loved the energy. Looking forward to this getting more views than any other recent video
I wish they had linked his channel at the end…
finally a real celeb!
We got Linus saying "waifu" to Jimmy and Bad Bunny before GTA6
Yes, started watching back in 2013ish and now I’m a technical director. I learn so much from LTT.
Where is the segue to his sponsors?
This isn’t AI? Awe I’m so happy
Linus with makeup hits different
The people that do hair and make up for everyone on the show did Linus' hair like a mom getting her little boy ready for school and put wayyyyyy too much make up on his face.   Network TV needs to learn to let people be themselves. 😕
GEEZ never though Linus would stoop this low.Thought he had standards   lol
Homelabbing represent 🤜
knew he was an alien
Linus doing this is a big fail We liked him because he was like us, not like the posers in the tv.
Who got the tech tips!!!
IM FANGIRLING SO HARD AT THIS CROSSOVER
its weird to see Linus with foundation
How Linus managed to do all that.. without dropping a single item? Amazing, just amazing!
LTT being nervous,that's new.
WHAT AN INSANE CROSSOVER 😮😮😂 - linus you fuckin crushed it
why is he fanboying over fucking retard like jimmy fallon
This is crazy ❤
This Sebastian guy looks a lot like Linus T. Echtips
Right so why does this feel like hes putting on this fake hyped persona? Like that you are on American TV doesnt mean you have to act fake hyped.
This needs to be a regular thing after CES wraps up each year!
I have never seen Linus so nervous before but once he starts talking tech,  his persona snaps in.
This is positively adorable
LTT screw driver?
Proud of you Linus, you were obviously nervous but you smashed it!!!
Linus is the 🐐
This could be a weekly segment but I'm not sure they could afford Linus
This is so unreal. It's funny the moment he started talking about the tech, the nervous Linus went away.
Fallon looks bored and confused, might be his must sincere performance to date on that show 😅
AYYY LINUSSS
I need those glasses
PLEASE MAKE THIS A REGULAR SEGMENT 😭😭😭😭
We love Linus!!!! Thank you TTS for having LTT!!!!
GOAT
Man Linus is having the time of his life this is hilarious
Linus will recuring guest or what ?NBA want to be nerdy
That’s cool
I wasn't expecting Linus tech tips to do the tonight show but it makes is significantly better
Linus ted talk when
This is surreal
This needs to be a regular segment. Linus smashed it!
Linus! You forgot the segue to your sponsor in the bag!
Not a usual fan of the show, but this one was fun
I want that Hoodie! Does it come with a matching Screwdriver?
So nervous yet fallons lucky to get half the views of any given ltt video
Amazing!! From a shop to the top. LTT
Give Linus a segment where he shows you cool tech once in a while 🙏🏽
It's weird seeing Linus on television :D
"Don't worry about it" is the best and most honest explanation of how tech works to a layman who doesn't need to know or care.  I'll see if I can get away with using that.
Never in my life would I have seen this coming
First time seeing anything from Jimmy in years.  Linus being so nervous was not somthing I thought I'd see ever again so this was a wild ride.
Wow that hairdo is sure different for sure.
Shows up Pulls out a bunch of tech Tells Jimmy he has a small penis Doesn't elaborate  Leaves  Only thing missing was a segue to our sponsor.
free promotion for lenovo
I have no idea who this is but he's freaking adorable.  Get in my pocket tech nerd!
Best segment in a while...!
holy shit linus is WIRED here,.. they gave him the red cordial! xD
linus is so nervous haha, gratz bro!
I'm expecting his new catchphrase to be "Don't worry 'bout it".
I can feel Linus so geeking out. I'll be geeking out too man.
this is awesome 👏🏻!
Now do Hot Ones.
why's he's acting like it's the first time infront of a camera or livestream?
We need a full episode with Linus with more gadgets
thats the most excited Ive seen Linus ever. amazing.
Wasn't expecting any people other than celebrities getting interview, let alone Linus himself lol
Where is Dan? What kind of productionnis this?
They overclocked Linus
I’ve never seen Linus this on edge you can see how excited he is.
Wow! Let’s bring cool  tech to the mainstream audience!  Wonderful to see Linus in a different setting..  here’s a segue to our sponsor…
Never had a Linus + Jimmy + Bad Bunny mashup in my bingo card but it works perfectly. Great job Linus!
i have no idea who is bad bunny is, but woo linus
Take a deep breath Linus. You talk to more people in your videos than you do on this show.
2 controversial figures who's controversies no one gives a toss about now, great.
I never thought I'd see the day .. He was so so nervous..  pulled it off though...
Same guy that got caught exposing what’s on an IT test ? Wow
normies are to easily baffled :D
I am Puerto Rican and a long time fan of Linus. I literally cannot believe I am seeing Bad Bunny and Linus together on live television.
I never thought id see Bad bunny and linus in the same video. Feels like a fortnite colab lol
The way this guy talks gives me anxiety. He reminds me of a tweaker I had to fight off in college.
great job Linus! you killed it!
Linus is so genuine in this interview. He's like a kid at christmas, he's so nervous yet so excited. You can tell in his voice as well. Great job LTT
Linus the sellout
This could be a nice segment each year after CES. Linus did great even though I could tell he was a bit nervous.
Ha he looks so excited
I love how I can't tell if Linus is nervous or excited.  Probably both but I can't decipher it!
dude has literally become the wordlwide ambassador for tech and we're all so proud
Linus in socks and sandals on the Tonight Show was not on my 2025 bingo card. This is insane!
This needs to be a monthly segment just saying
I really thought Bad Bunny was some girl popstar. Had no idea it was a guy. Why would he call himself that? Anyways, Linus did great! He mentioned the products just enough to let you know they existed and had names but didn't bog you down in details.
"How does it do that?" "Don't worry about it." Linus knows the audience well.
So what's today sponsor
you have to bring Linus more often
So much energy and hand movement 😂.
Linus was freakin nervous, love it! But he did it either way. Long way from the old house and the hard drives in the sink.
There are austrailians bringing in animals and there's canadians bringing techs lol😂
They couldn't get the black guy that dose tech? RACIST!
3:51 Linus Sex Tips
Linus is one of the few channels I can't unsubscribe.
i love you linus
Wow that’s some cool tech! Where did you get that backpack?
Can we appreciate. HE DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING?!
Linus sucks!
Is there a url to those glasses anywhere?
Okay, this is the 1st time, I've seen him nervous.
Linus freaking nailed it here.
I have never seen Linus so nervous.
Okay, this is the 1st time, I've seen him nervous.
We got Linus Tech Tips on TV before GTA VI and TES VI 🎉🎉🎉
Crazy seeing him on a talkshow!
Our boy made it😃
I didn’t know i wanted use a rectangular screen before i saw this!!, im kidding it looks lame
When he said "I can't wait to tell..." I lowkey thought he was about to say a sponsor read
This is a massive collab… You know what else is massive?
3:35 IS THIS THE BROOKE AND JUBAL MR GIGGLES?
That’s our boy!
I’ve never seen Linus so nervous! You did great though!
Are you hearing how much Linus voice shaking? He must be nervous as hell lol
I love how over the top Linus's persona is in this one
This made me have anxiety to watch.
My favorite YouTuber and the biggest artist in my country doing a collab is absolutely crazy
Great job Linus. It was obvious it wasn't your comfort zone but still it wasn't bad and really loved it. Hope they let you do bit more of your style in future.  And why tf you didn't drop anything? It would've been so good 😅
No LTT store backpack promo?
I will not buy any laptop below 20 inches. 21 is perfect size
I love that Linus out of his comfort zone is ADHD, been a while since we have seen that Linus! He did a great job though, maybe you should have him as your official tech correspondent
Of course Jimmy doesn't know what a Waifu is. xD
Wow ❤
This is mad.
No DBrand sponsorship?
Subtle "wink" with the waifu bot :p
"You look down and thought a few inches would be nice" 😂
Wow, wasn't expecting to see this, had to look twice as I thought I'd read it wrong
Woah, this is a collab that I didn't see coming.
Good job Linus ! 👏 That couldn't have been easy. 😊
3:28 My man on TV still rocking with them Sandals.
Great job linus
It’s hard believing this isn’t ai cause it was so unexpected for me
Linus not forgetting to give AMD a quick shoutout when showing the handheld 😂 He did so well despite clearly being nervous!
I’m so happy for Linus! He and his team deserve this mainstream exposure!
I legit thought this was AI
Linus on live TV with Bad Bunny is some 2025 shit
I never expected this collaboration😂😂
This was smsrt, he was able to get people who never heard of him to look him up. This one appearance probably got him money money
dude Linus is so nervous! like I've seen him excited and whatnot but bro is shivering his timbers!
This LTT episode is weird.
bad bunny bringing home those glasses 😂😂
sometimes it's easy to forget how much of a dork linus is
come on Linus! This was your opportunity to showcase a new LTT product, a SUIT!!
Expected him to say LLTSTORE at least once
Linus's Tech Tips 😂
This is such a cute formula, a mainstream celebrity + a youtuber talking about their niche, they should do this more
Ain't no way lol
To bad it was on th8s hums show but glad to see linus there
linus sniff something right before this? lol
Jimmy Fallon is a useless tw4t, this video is only recommended to me, because of LTT. Legacy media is dead. This isn't LTT winning, this is Jimmy struggling for relevance.
asi que tenemos a bad bunny y linus en el mismo sitio, esto es tan surrealista...
Linus acting hella weird
Who are the dudes next to the lttstore guy?
Fake Linus, he didn't drop anything! 😂
"Linus's tech tips are on youtube everybody" is how I'd imagine my grandma would tell people about LTT.
One smart person 2 people
Ain't no way
100% Linus is so nervous if you handed him anything, it would be dropped.
Never seen this star struck version of Linus before! Seemed so unscripted.
Linus knew about Honey's scams years ago, told no one and let them continue syphoning money from content creators.
What is diddys fleshlight doing there
daaamn bro he's nervous ....
Not only did he make one but two dick jokes. That our Linus!
disgusting
damnit.. waifus appeared on Jimmy fallon... waifus are now dead. RIP to all the waifus out there but this is where all good things come to die.
Goofy
Our Boi
Da fuq was with the makeup?
Linus went full Linus and I love it
this is so internet culture vs boomer culture lol
so freakin dope, man. Love the LTT Team. W Linus. W LTT
Man. Thats cool to be on USA television. Sadly im in Europe
We love Linus
Wild to see Linus on Jimmy. And by the view count rise, seems they need Linus more then Linus needs them. Big congrats to linus
im so proud bro i started  IT becouse of LTT and now im watching linus in the tonight show.
The show should have a regular segment, where Linus just comes in and showcases random new and upcoming tech!!
This needs to be the new trend. Youtube media crossover.
You've come a long way.....congrats and thank you Linus
Dang Linus seems stressed the heck out.
In the beginning it sounds like Jimmy Fallon calls Linus "Noah".
When the hell did this happen?
IS HE WEARING SOCKS WITH SANDALS!?!?!?
I love that Linus was just so super hyped by just being there and to see that human side of him that could get super nervous in an unfamiliar situation. This was the perfect video. Once he got to talk about Tech he became so unbelievably authentic and excited talking about new stuff that it was so contagious. ❤❤❤
Dude was shaking and ready to pass out
Keepin’ it real with those shoes Linus.   And you nailed it.   Everybody knows the rules.
So funny that   Linus talking about Linus - "nervous, look mom I'm on TV energy"  Linus starts talking tech -"ahhhh back to teaching dummy's about tech energy"
NOWAY WTF
Look I don’t watch much of Jimmy but from what I have been exposed to, why does it feel like he’s being such an uninterested pos relative to how he acts with “a-listers” here? Feels like he thinks he’s “above” Linus and not giving him the same energy, real disappointing
Definitely should be a regular segment.
my fav tech youtuber and my fav musical artist in a jimmy fallon show, isnt what i expected in 2025 😭🙏
Linus did well, now let's make him appear at least once a month for tech updates lol
LINUS LINUS LINUS! Legions of nerds are watching this episode. <3 Congrats man
why is he so nervous man it's almost like he never sat in front of cameras
That show is hurting so bad they’re looking for a free tech upgrade.
Linus looks like he's had coffee for the first time in his life. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wadahel
linus totally crushed it! went about as good as it could have! congrats man
bro is indeed exited
He done the community well. Great milestone. Hopefully there’s more to come out of this.👍
First time seeing linus without LTT STORE DOT COM sponsor
Jesus Christ, Linus is on The Tonight Show.  That's... this is... I mean..... wow.
Awesome
This is so cringe …
you recive a like only because i see linus:)))
Oh, it's nice to see Linus doing appearances on smaller shows in the legacy media space ❤
Just here for Linus ❤
LTT lets goooo baby
You made it Linus ❤
It’s curious and kinda cute to see someone that has so much experience struggle to maintain composure on live tv.
Bro you crushed it, idk why you were so worried on the Wan Show
Would love to see Linus on regularly for tech stuff.
as an LTT fan, you can hear how Linus is flustered.. hahaha
So glad hegot such an exposure. it'll do Jimmy so good.
You can tell the host of the show was being hosted lol. They had no idea how to interact with Linus
Bro smashed it !!! Been watching him from the beginning.
who goes on TV wearing socks in sandals, come on man.
6:33 I thought that handheld was on crack with 30 buttons on one side
Linus explaining  waifu on Jimmy Fallon was not on my 2025 bingo card
Linus is nervous af. Had to double check my playback speed. 😂
Tough crowd
who tf is the guy behind the desk with jimmy?
he didnt even drop anything. FAKE!!!
Who here wants em all to drop the woke nonsense?
He did a really good job. Proud of my boy.
Love Linus, Jimmy Fallon sucks though
Baby Linus is now Adult Linus
Linus was nervous :)
Nailed it brother well done!
Linus is Legend 🎉
Can we please appreciate the incredible journey of “waifu” starting all the way back in azumanga daioh to being uttered in the friggin tonight show
I never thought i'd see the day this would happen.
way to go linuss
Let's go Linus!
Linus killed it and those display glasses is something I want real bad
There ain’t no way
cool, shame didnt go much into his history etc
That is the most nervous I've seen Linus ever
We want more Linus!!!! ❤❤❤
Congratulations Linus , dude uou you really made it man. Unbelievable
"Don't worry about it" is the best explanation for how the world works. :)
I thought he was gonna wip out his modular laptop Framework.
Linus is on TV! Well done!
Great segment!
i was hoping for a sneaky promo for the back pack , i know it was hard to not do it linus
this is gonna happen after every CES , I Guarantee you.
Love how Linus struggled to shake off or filter out the nerves, makes him more human! You represent us Linus!!
linus should have a segment for new tech every CES or every few months on fallon
Is that an LTT backpack? Wonder where I could buy one of those. Is there some kind of LTT Store? Dot com?
….like this segue to our sponsor!!
okey ... Linus LTT tech and bad bunny hahah what !!! hahah noooo hahah
Finally, the bad bunny Linus tech tips collab we all asked for
Congratulations Linus. I'm so happy for you dude.
Today I learned: 1. LInus gets nervous. 2. Linus is super funny even when nervous. 3. Linus brought home some cool sh*t from CES
Damn nice to watch Linus without being sandwiched by ads
a los conciertos de Bad Bunny ya no va nadie...pero de repente lo tenemos en todas partes...esto es brutal
Always thought Linus was on the smaller side but somehow he looks jacked here? Is Fallon just tiny or what?
ayo who did his makeup. Made him cheeky and blushy lol
Bro still pulled up in the socks and sandals. Gotta love him
Poor Linus…most nervous I’ve ever seen him.
this was legitimately so cute.
What kinda crossover is this?
I don't think I've heard Linus's voice get that nervous high pitched for years now, don't think since he was located in the old Langley house,  could tell he wasn't sure how to be the guest instead of a host.
Remember people; this is the man who craps on other channels. You may forget,  Gamer Nexus Steve wont.
It's shortlinus!
Polar bear in Arlington Texas
2:18 I think this may have been the first time ever that the word “Waifu” was uttered on the Tonight Show 😂😂
A segwayless LTT video?
Why is he there what is this collab 😭
no sponsor segue disappointed Linus
Great job linus!
Nice to see linus in a regular tv show
TIL Linus has a surname!
WHERE IS the SEGUE? I dont believe this is linus. I believe this to be AI generated Linus. Because there is no segue.
bad bunny? the pro wrestler?
Who is this bad bunny guy?
wow it's great Linus lowered himself to appear on a tiny late night show watched by about 1% of his audience.
Linus killed it!
Good for Linus, he nailed that segment
Great to see him here… however the glitz glam and corruption is  Best left to Hollywood
Linus might want to take a chill pill or two. As regular viewer I promise he's not usually this nervous in front of camera, 😅. He told us he has adhd or something, but granted the live audience might be a very different ball game than youtubing.
Love how his inner geek came out of hiding
Our Linus was so nervous xD you survived, well done
AI is getting better and better in videos
Dayummmm linus on late night fkin wild he looks mega excited haha
linus showing up to jimmy fallon in got damn socks & sandals
*Put AR glasses *Still watch the screen  I think when AR glasses becomes norm this would enter the dad jokes hall of fame
linus is a disgusting human
Youtubers become celebrities who is that third person called bunny 🐰?
this is a fever dream
Trained, ready, and legendary. 10/10 he did his thing. So happy/proud for tech and to aww a youtuber do it. Legendary. So dope 🔥
Linus doing side quests.
I watch Linus in videos every single day for years. But I can't watch him here for more than 30 seconds. 😂
commenting for Linus :p
He was so nevous till he could reach for his bag and show his party tricks. That was awkward but glad it got better in the end
Never... ever... seen Linus so nervous.
Heck yea. The king of the nerds did it.
What?, no you didnt! Wohooooo!
They should hire Linus to boost their views
The LTT bag though
The most impressive thing to me is how Linus managed to make Jimmy Fallon not be cringy for the first time in history?
Linus stuck in intro mode is odd to see
Dude, that's not Linus haircut.. what did they do to him, 😅
got more views in 4h than any of these videos, niceee, gj Linus
Man I am so happy for him
we got joshua block with danny duncan and linus with jimmy kimmel all in the same day
damn this show is cringe and Linus is the least cringy in the shot
Linus is too good for Jimmy
The one youtube dude who I religiously watch and will defend til death.
which game is that??
Linus was one of my first youtube follows
This is how I felt like introducing new techs to my boomer relatives 😂
Even with the great quality and comfortable thickness of the LTT hoodie, you can see this man’s heart jumping 😅.
GET LINUS ON EVERY MONTH TO SHOW US THE LATEST GADGETS!!
✅
the socks in sandals he will never give up on those
Those sunglasses are pretty cool
Linus is at the pinnacle of his career. Congrats bro.
Easy marketing for the products
This is the least I've heard fallon talk, well done Linus
Whhhaaat? You Didnt talk about Ai frame gen and the 5090? JIMMY WANTS ANSWERS!
That moment I open my YouTube and see Linus on Fallon was not something I was expecting to see. Good job man! Too bad they missed out on the opportunity for you to throw it to their sponsors.
I didn’t have Bad Bunny + Linus Tech Tips on Jimmy Fallon anywhere near my bingo card
Kinda mad dbrand didnt mess with this shoot😂
3:34 not the sandals with socks...
Linus!!!!! I have been watching since forever lol still am! You met bad bunny! Well PR watches you linus hehe!!!  Bad bunny el mejor!!!!!!!!! ❤ desde PR bb! 😂❤  estamos juquiaos! Sin parar cn ese album! Me encanta! ❤
My Canadian brother - so happy to see Linus, you have the excitement of a kid but more intelligent than most adults and it rocks 😎🤘
LINUS ON THE TONIGHT SHOW?
Can tell your nervous but why couldn't we get wan show Linus
WHAT!?
Linus with bad bunny, i never thought it
???????
DUUUUUUUDE Linus!!! this is AMAZING!!!! Congrats :D
He’s actually really good at this wth, he could do a tech tv show honestly, bringing in big names and just blowing their minds with tech. Good stuff Linus !
3:35 WOW a laptop 😮🤣🤣
Where's the Linus drop the mic?
Well done Linus.... I think you safely smashed the ball put the park here
As someone who watches LTT and rhe sub channels... good to see linus here :)
Love Linus and his teams videos, poor guy is so nervous and understandable.
Linus on Kimmel accompanied by Bad Bunny was not on my bingo card
I love how excited linus is
WOW!!!! the unbelievable collab!! lets goooooooooooooo
Man... It's so weird he didn't mention where he got that backpack from probably some sort of online store.
Linus is so incredibly nervous at the start hahaha, but he immediately gets more comfortable around the 1:30 mark and the change is very noticeable
Someone's gotta check Bad Bunny's pockets lol
Wow Linus on real actual TV. 🎉
Did they invite him on or does he or ces have to pay for him to be on ?
YAYYYY LINUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Such a nervous Linus! lol. First time i've seen him that nervous. 🤣 You know you are gonna look back at this in 2 years and be cringing but everyone has to break their cherry at some point 😉
LTT is Mainstream now😊Congratulations on your TV debut
This is perfect representation of LTT: crazy tech and dick jokes
This makes me realise that internet famous people and non internet famous people are totally different
bad bunny linus and fallon my three worlds are colliding lmaooo
But where can I get that backpack!??
First time seeing Linus nervous
Good to see Linus didn't drop anything
Legend.
Linus is here!!!
Damn that wasn't even the exciting stuff from CES but I guess what Linus could steal was very limited
And missed the opportunity to lttstore the crap out of the backpack memtion! Nerves i guess ❤️
hahaha coool
His last name is Sebastian? I always thought it was TechTips
@LinusTechTips is so right about the little seeds they plant in us here and there, because of your videos, my organization has refused to hire an actual IT guy, now i have to do two jobs !!
This should be a regular segment on the show, Linus was fantastic!
This show was sponsored by ,,LENOVO" 😂
4:20 first time since the MS Surface Studio that Tech has been properly wow. Feels like the 2000's again..
Who's this guy on the right
We got Linus on the tonight show before GTA 6
Holy shit, I’ve never seen Linus so nervous. You’d think he would be comfortable in front of a camera 😂
Linus is so excited lol.
Wtffff🤣
he is the biggest cuck I've ever seen in my life.
I don’t think i’ve ever seen linus this nervous. He’s basically shaking
Guy is so annoying , so fake - mr tumbles of tech
Plotwist: this is all AI generated, sponsored by Nvidia
What’s with the sound?
oh my god he educated jimmy fallon on waifus, this is the greatest timeline
Full Of Energy 🎉 Love Him
Was that the seque? To your sponsor?😂 nice.
No plug for his LTT backpack?
the legend
LinusTechTips is bottom of the barreo guys cmon
Not gonna lie, I thought this was AI generated. If I hadn’t heard Linus talk about it in WAN show then I would have bet it was.
I have never seen Linus so nervous lol
I simply cannot sleep knowing he didn't plug the new backpack
"Humanoid waifu robots that you can 😉interact with"  very clever linus...
Been watching him close to 10y now
Linus is representign us guys, be little soft. Next time he comes he'll do better.  But he looks Nervous AF though
Linus sounds super nervous 😂
No clue who bad bunny is, but Linux Sebastian? now we are cooking with the big ones!!
I don’t watch American TV.  I watched this. Finally, a deserving guest!  I don’t like the shitty American attempt at humour though 😂
I’ve never seen Linus so nervous 😂
Linus looks like he's been added with CGI
WE WANT MKBHD
Did bab bunny keep the glasses?? Lol 😂😂😂
Linux so nervous
He didnt drop anything😂
Damn Linus is nervous as hell
Didn't know this happened at all
This was not on my Bingo card
Was not expecting this
Linus is so excited to be there it's like he won his appearance in a contest.
what's jimmy Fallon's talent other than to look innocent ?
Bad bunny on WAN show when?
Haven't seen Linus this nervous ever since his wife roasted him
whys waiting for Linus to say "and here's a segue to our sponsor " the only thing im hoping to hear
Loves to mis-treat his female staff, the lad.
Linus is clearly mega nervous. Well done for branching out to something new.
At least he didn't tell them about Linus Sex Tips.
Nerds are on TV now !!!!!!!!
I have a feeling Jimmy Fallon going to make him a returning guest!  I was waiting for, “Visit LTT store…”
He’s nervous haha. I’m so proud of him! It’s like watching someone you’ve known forever achieve something massive. It’s so cool they gave him airtime. He’s one* the main reason so many kids, teens and even adults have dived into custom PC building. Congrats guys! I bet the whole team is freaking out over this!
Linus is such an entertaining guest
Linus is very nervous. That’s not how he talks on his videos. He’s very very nervous. Anyways, he made it!!!  He deserves it.
Man, what a privilege for Jimmy Fallon to get to interview Linus Sebastian!
I would like to see Linus to be a guest in Clueless Gamer
Sandals and  socks, not disappointed :D
Papa
I have a feeling Jimmy Fallon going to make him a returning guest!
Linus so hyped
7:35 Diablo cabron   JAJAJAJAJJJ
OK this is deffo black mirror
Don't think people who watch TV understand what doom scrolling is..
First time on Jimmy's show.
Socks and sandals on national TV, baller move <3
Ive never seen linus be so hyper
boy that is something new
When the camera panned back... dunno why I was surprised but of course he's wearing his socks and sandals X'D
I'm assuming Linus isn't getting those sunglasses back. 😕
You can tell he's so nervous, and so excited. 🎉 Congrats on getting out Linus!
linus on jimmy fallon wtf
Why didn't linus have a prop PC to drop on the floor and put the audience in shock when it's parts all fell out? 😂
ive never seen linus this nervous, its kind of cool to see :P
I've followed Linus since NCIX and I am blown away that I am seeing Linus on Jimmy Fallon.
Super cute Linus ❤
The excitement and raw energy coming from Linus is giving me Steve Irwin vibes when he'd be on a show presenting some animals or whatever. I dig it.
Linus killed it! it’s so cool to see him on TV!
I love how Linus started as an anxious breathless guy on someone else's show, then once it came time to talk about tech he took over the show entirely and started presenting products like it was LTT.     A true nerd, comfortable only in his natural habitat.
well dbrand about to call this man Twitchy Linus
Linus spreading his tips all over the place....
Who's the guy sat next to Jimmy. Looks like a AliExpress mario Lopez
😂😂😂 2:41  I’ll take the broken defraculator and my grandson wants the s3x robot 😂😂😂
and he didnt even mention DBrand once....
I think I seen this guy before, yea the sad meme guy, is it Linux or something? XD
He's so nervous bless him ❤
Mom's spaghetti
Never thought I'd see the day Linus appearing on Jimmy.
What da hell
Hell yeah Linus!
Jimmy Fallon is such a weirdo.
is this AI?
Canadian talent right there
Is this AI?
Bad Bunny still has the first pair of glasses.
Linus should do hot ones next
Go ham on the like button ltt fam!
Linus a legend fr.
As a huge fan of ltt I gotta say seeing him make his way into msm is so satisfying and I'm as happy as can be for him.
Linus on Fallon wasnt on my Bucket List... this was awesome.  I missed the Segway to his Sponsor. :(
But did they mention the "hard r" moment, still one of the fucking funniest things ever
Linus please Stephen Colbert next. I think Stephen is way more into tech than Jimmy. Surreal to watch this tho after being a fan of Linus for 12 years.
Omg they didn't get the the Wifu joke! These people are so pure and unprepared for the next generation 😂
wish he talked about his debute more and his struggles. maybe in the next episode (i am aware he talks about that in wan n such)
LTT on the tonight show before gta 6 is crazy
I can't tell if Linus is nervous or just excited. I'm guessing a bit of both.
This was just awesome. Good job Linus.
5:48 Actually, I had this idea from 2016 when i saw a Tamil song called "Jithu Jilladi", where the Hero changes the specs color!
Linus Sebastian, Everybody!    Linus should've did the Jimmy Fallon, Everybody! as well.
Ltt store 😂
I love how nervous Linus is to be on 'real' TV 😂
16.1M subscribers 7,148 videos 8,398,101,950 views ...and counting
Did he kept the glasses? 😆 That joke went too far
this sucked man
Wtf
wtf is linus doing here.
My brain hurts this is too unexpected
Holy crap he is nervous as f in front of a full audience
Who are these people interviewing linus sebastian?
What is this weird format? Why does this channel have 32mil subs?
Yes Linus
Finally Linus has achieved Tech God status!!! He is officially the Elon Musk of Tech-tubers!!
Love LTT content. And great to see that Linus is so excited.
I am quite disappointed he did't show the screwdriver with any kind of excuse
We got linus on real TV before GTA 6
Linus IS so TOXIC
didnt DROP a dang thing.  :(    HIGHLY DISAPOINTED ABOUT THAT. :(    WHERE THE TRUE LINUS.??  WHERE .
bad bunny is a guy?
Holy wtf?!?!?! The crossover I never knew I needed!
This segemt started with Jimmy giving uninterested "alright, let's get this over with" and ended with Jimmy giving, "THIS IS AMAZING!"
He's so happy lololol
i really wasnt expecting this lol
Very cool 🔥
Been following Linus for as long as I can remember and loved every minute of this. Have him on again!
You can see how nervous Linus is and that they are not ready for Linus Energy. Gotta love all us LTT Nerds in the Comments!😂  - LTT Fan Gang
We got Linus on the Jimmy show before GTA 6!
Bad bunny taking those glasses is such a good PR for that brand, they must be jumping of happiness
Watching this shows or actually proves how much Linus truly loves his job and is a prime example of the saying "if you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life." He just has fun!
Linus settled in well, amazing job can't wait to here about it on wan!!!
As I saw, jimmy's heart wasn't on the techs but on the show, cause he wasn't all familiar or interested in techs like us But the show was fun to watch.
Bloody hate how whoopy American audiences are
I am sure it is ai generated
Linus ❤
So great to see him giddy again
this is the most unexpected crossover episode ever
wait,actual Linus?
Jimmy finally made it onto an LTT video!
He acts like how Elijah acts in linus's video
What happened to Linus’s hair?
Holly shizz fuchk, Linus, you've finally made it on TV, on one of the most popular shows and your avg. views and audience is probably 50% bigger, need to check stats but 150k+ views in good 2 hours seems high for Fallon. Still like them both, but great performance of both. No wonder Linus grew his channel so much, he's natural on camera, looks that live cam too, but !! We all need to PRAISE HIS WIFE YVONNE TOO !! Cause I think she was also the huge part of the story and success behind the scenes, from first supporting Linus from NCIX Tech Tips to Linus Tech Tips (LTT) and she was in my opinion also half of the business brain behind the Linus Media Group (LMG) company! Saw Linus' first video when I was actually looking for another Linus (Torvalds - the creator of Linux kernel) and was probably in first 200 subscribers for NCIX tips and in first 1000 LTT channel sub.  That first LTT house was legendary with all house water-cooling and that kitchen set and I'm sure now Jensen from Nvidia, only the biggest tech and overall  company in the world, I bet he's copying the concept when revealing products "in kitchen"...  P.s., I still love it, although the "red line" has slightly shifted a bit from reviews and technical stuff to bit less technical and more like school type explainational, at least in main channel, he's still doing the great job, he's very well explaining the tech to plant the seeds and I just love my top 3 tech channels (LTT/LMG, GN Gamers Nexus and Wendell from Level1tech/L1Linux...) are now not overlapping (except on some product releases with embargo). There are tons of other to mention like Hardware/Monitors Unboxed, Optimum & similar that are deep diving into not just specific area but even specialized field of the big umbrella we call "tech(nology)"... So Kudos and hats off and hands down on their work... They're mostly "real OG" when you had 200.000 subs and still couldn't survive, and here I should really point out and praise Yvonne for her patience, love for Linus but mostly supporting and believing in him....
This should be a regular thing, Linus Tech Update once every few months!
These are innovation not what apple comes up with.
This would have been so much better is it wasn't jimmy fallon.
Our boy moving up in the world! 😁
Time to unsubscribe
0:57 does he know about dbrand and LTT realtionship?😂😂
Awesome to get him on your show!!!
I heard Linus say Waifu on live TV. My life is now complete.
Dude's energy is so annoying on live tv. Save it for tech videos, Linus.
It feels silly to say but I’ve been going through some hard things but it makes me happy seeing Linus just being himself around other people. His nervousness reminds me how similar we all are to which is something almost everyone forgets it feels. I can’t describe how much I appreciated this, thank you Linus for being you.
So happy for Linus and Linus Media Group, because his team absolutely deserves some recognition for their role in bringing the company to where it is today. Linus has often been praised by his friends, colleagues, and peers as one of the hardest working people they've ever met. He built his company so long ago with almost nothing, and now I'm so proud of him for having this brilliant segment to show for his decades of hard work. I hope to someday have something to show for my passion in tech like Linus. Thank you for your help, instruction, and humor Linus. You were a significant inspiration for myself and millions of others who love tech. Love you Linus & Co! There are more opportunities coming for you, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for you.
As an LTT fan this is the best thing ever. You can actually hear the excitement in Linus' voice!
Oh boy, Linus is at 100 miles per hour... Super nervous
You gotta love that even on The Tonight Show, Linus is rocking socks and sandals.
2:50 lamo his hands are so shaky when he puts the pen back
Bro is on cocaine
Must have been a real honor for jimmy to interview such a legend. And he didnt even drop anything...
Linus did the unthinkable, made Jimmy look cool
You did great Linus!  Maybe you can do an annual CES wrap up for jimmy going forward
I only watched this episode of The Tonight Show, because my boy Linus was on it... I don't watch the show otherwise [ long time fan of his shows ^.^  @LinusTechTips
Holy shit it's Linus
i love how he describes it as planting seeds rather than a full blown tech tutorial   have always loved LMG and i didnt realize that until now lol
His high pitch turned dried, the man IS nervous. Here is segue to our sponsor.
who cares?
Never seen linus act so on edge or egger! Must be the never 🤷🏽‍♂️  Anyways too job!
Bad bunny probably the most wholesome guy but his music sucks lmao
Take that MKBHD
Pero que coño hace Linus y Bad Bunny en la misma sala
Never thought I'd hear high pitched Linus again lol 😅
Yeesss
the goat, steve erwin of tech.
wtf
linus y bad bunny en la misna sala hablando que está pasando JAJAJAJAJA
firs time i see linus this exsited
LETS GOOOOOO!!! LINUS!! Yassssss. Saw the video on my feed, and totally hyped me up. You made it to late night talk show!! SOOOO DAMN COOL!!! Congrats man. LTT!!!
Linus literally has more views than them no need to be nervous 😭
How cool! This has to become the tech corner for the show now! Great job Linus🎉
He’s not even the ceo of his own company anymore 😂
This is the MOST unexpected collab
THIS IS SO COOL!!!
I had to check if I was on 1.25x or 1.5x speed.
Reminds me of Steve Irwin. Let’s go!! 😂
This is why i love jimmy. He includes everyone aside from celebrities
What in the shortlinus
My boy Linus , great job man. So happy seeing you at The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
No way, good on you Linus!
The last glasses is a cool idea i would get one of its cheap
Linus on Fallon? Cool!
Am I the only one waiting for the segue to our sponsor?
Wow.
No way. Linus finally made it to the big screen 😅
this was not on my 2025 calendar wtf, so proud of linus!
Hey Linus, you're a moral guiding star for me And has shaped my career over the last 7 years as a health professional My first comment on one of your videos was "funny voice" or something, And now I'm so happy for your success
this better be a recurring segment!
7:35 "diablo cab...* 😅😂
what is that make up linus
3:00 Linus had a missed opportunity here! he could of mentioned tech that didn't work out "like the Segway to our sponsor..."
I don't think I've ever seen Linus this excited
no lttstore plug? smh 😔
He came across so nervous
the boy did good...
I don’t exactly know why I feel this… but damn I am so proud of Linus. He did great.
damn.imagine connecting ure phone to dat glasses and wtching tiktok. and playing SUN WOKONG.
"I don't know what to do with my hands"
Best guest ever 👏
Linus is a bit like Steve Irwin, he loves tech. He needs to return a few times.
i know hes a canadian millionaire ill likely never meet, Its really cool seeing this guy Ive seen nearly every day for 10 years, make it to the "big leagues" (even if it gets less views now than his own channel) Hes clearly nervous but did so well showing off actually cool tech to "legitimize" his job to normies. love it.
Never seen Linus freaking out like this . I would have freaked out if I met Lisa sue not Jimmy
This was so cool! Thanks Linus!!
Still waiting for the segway to the sponsor...
Jeez Linus calm down, it is just TV.
ONLY MILLIONS of us AMERICANS WATCHING..... no big deal. :)    Good job LINUS.    We are all nervous with you.
bad bunny did exactly what i would have done. pocket that glasses. its awesome.
Bro would play a good Lex Luther !
This is the most unespected crossover ive seen in all anime's history
Totally not staged 😂
What the hell is going on in 2025?!?!?!
Linus next to Bad Bunny wasnt on my 2025 bingo card
So happy to see the boy on TV. Been watching him for years and years jeez
Not the socks and sandals on tonights show
He was nervous but he did it ... what a man
First ever no ads video of linus lol
I would watch more of this for Linus to keeps coming out introducing new tech Steve Irwin style.
I’m stressed too
alright, who gave linus a red bull
LTT :)
Bad Bunny really made it 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Fallon looks like such an arrogant prick.
Linus, you're the best,man. Keep on being awesome. Loved it when you got in the zone talking about what you're passionate about and just owned the situation. Also, Props to Bad Bunny for helping Linus center.
I was not expecting this XD
Awesome interview.. Love LTT, but BB and JF mixed into it was just gold..
3:32 I wonder where he got that sleek looking backpack from! It looks like it has many pockets but still keeping it's sleek form... Would anyone know where on earth I can get such thoughtful products like that backpack?
I was waiting for Jimmy to ask about the backpack!
he almost feels like a salesman
this is weird guys
Linus is so strange on TV. its like another person. Tech Steve Irwin
we got linus on tonight show before gta 6
Hell yeah Linus, what a career moment!
Baldurs gate 3 ftw
It’s cute to see him so excited! Haha this is great.
Linus Made it !!! :)
They can't handle Linus' energy lol
"Which one of the glasses suits Bad Bunny?" "Yes."
Never thought I’d see a tech YouTuber on a late night show 😂
This is a fever dream.
Why is bad bunny there
Someone next to Fallon that makes him seem cool by comparison is rare air.
We need jimmy on WAN we didn't get enough of them both
Woowww Linus is on the Tonight Show! This is awesome!! Congrats on the entire team
Linus's energy made him famous. Not his tech knowledge. He is genuinely a likeable guy!
should've let him do the segue to the advertisements
Don't like Fallon, dont watch him, but had to for Linus!
I'm here for Linus. Who's that Jimmy guy?
Did us proud Linus!!
I learned how to build computers from watching his videos
THE SOCKS AND SANDALS LETS GOOO
2025 is a wild year so far
This is not Linus, come back to ltt 😅
HE MADE IT!!!
Linus chill
somehow linus made me watch fallon for 8 mins
Wtf I never thought I would see this Haahhaha
Linus is awesome hehehhee
Linus absolutely nailed the live presentation
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6, WOW
i wonder how much money he made off showing these 3 products here
I want the glasses at the END... its a wearable TV wherever you go....
All the Tonight Show printers work now.
bro, calm down lol
yoooo LINUS COOKED. THE GOAT IS ON THE BIG SCREENS NOW
Linus on TV like this is absolutely surreal. I am stoked.
_Brought to you by DBrand_
Linus is probably reading these so I just gotta say, you did great.
LINUS ‼️‼️‼️ The only channel I can keep focused on. Lol thank you Linus. 🕺🏽🕺🏽
Who is this Jimmy guy and how did he get to feature Linus
Despite Jimmy's general disintrest Linus did amazing and it kinda shows that he has a much better host personality seeing as he took charge and made it an amazing show
Wait what?
Nice seeing Linus on TV! More tech youtubers on mainstream pls!
Lets goooo!!! Linus
So cool omg❤
You could see this being a section every now and then on the show
We got linus on jimmy fallon before gta 6
I refuse to believe Jimmy Fallon doesn't know what a waifu is. If anything, the feigned ignorance is suspicious. (Then you get to the tech part and it's a lot more understandable).
Jimmy is good, but I really wish it was Conan who hosted Linus.
I literally thought this was ai in the first minute then seeing Linus’s genuine and corky reaction made me realize it was real, I’m so happy this happened!
make up linus is on another level. Also Congrats LTT 🎉
Peak Linus Nervous Energy 😅
cocaine is hell of a drug
Wow. I've never actually laughed at a Jimmy Kimmel segment before! LTT FTW!
anyone else expecting Linus to segue to a sponsor mid interview
1/10. He didn’t drop anything.
This is gold
Love how most of the comments are from the LTT supporters. It's exciting watching him grow and get more streamline interviews
This is so surreal to watch
Linus snuck the word Waifu onto national television. Amazing.  Great segment. Loved watching this.  Edit: And he got Baldur's Gate 3 on there. This segment got better and better
Why is no one talking about bad bunny being there? What a crossover
Amazing, more of this Jimmy!
Man, it’s a strange feeling of excitement and undue pride to see someone you’ve watched for years and years reach this level, you can’t help but feel ecstatic to see their success. When I heard Linus was going to be on I had to see it live and I did, and it was better than I could’ve imagined. Congratulations to Linus and everyone at LMG for this landmark achievement, I got to see Linus on TV! It was definitely worth the wait and sitting through the rest of the show lol, they saved the best for last.
Well done Linus!
When Jimmy mentioned bagpack i was waiting for LTT Backpack to be featured.😂
Is Jimmy Fallon always this bad? "OK... Next question. Oh OK... Next question"
Awsome to see him in old school tv!
Ahahahhaha Linus was screeching the whole time :D
Hey, it’s Linus!
Lmao
Oh look a real celebrity finally made their way onto the show.
mommmmm papa on the tv!!!!!!
Slime bout to freak out
This should be a regular segment … just to show new/wierd tech!! Way to go Linus!!
what happened to linux voice?
what in the love of God am I seeing right now Linus on Fallon and he has no beard lol
What a weird timeline we live in, where Linus is explaining what “waifu” means to Jimmy Fallon
I am fully surprised he didn't plug the backpack. Missed an opportunity lol
This was so wholesome, Linus was clearly nervous and excited to be there. Great to see him that hyped. Then the tech comes out and he’s in the zone! Absolutely knocked it out of the park, picking some fantastic products to show that would clearly have wide reaching appeal.
Linus honestly gave me some big laughs during this whole interview. But the "OMG" that escaped my mouth when they zoomed out and showed he was wearing his trademark Birkenstocks, talk about a power move! 😂 I hope he does more stuff like this in the future!
Wow, that's phenomenal! Great job, Linus!
wait...Linus on Fallon? Huh?
This is amazing Linus deserves this
Wtf yes sirr 😭✨
Wtf yes sirr 😭✨
What universe is this?
love seeing Linus here soo much!!!!
he is soo nervous at the start, but when he gets into the actual tech, he gets right into his groove
I'm so happy yall got Linus on the show, I love that man.
The socks and sandals are sending me!!! 😅❤  I love how he's unapologeticly himself. 🌟
Haven't seen Linus this excited in so long, amazing stuff, proud of him
So what did he drop in this video 😂
why is linus so off in this, did he get nervous lma9
I'm smiling whole time ❤
is linux nervous here? still he cool
Yeah my Boi Linuuuussssss go GET EM Tiger!
This is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SURREAL
LMAO  Bad Bunny pocketing the glasses  was hilarious
Never thought I’d see Linus and Bad Bunny in the same room
We got Linus in Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6
I have him as my background, he increased my wifi speeds by 21.6%
Linus almost came in the beginning lmao
wait wait wait, WTF! i aint mad im curious how the hell this happened! This also explains Linus being on other peoples podcasts. Damn Fine Presentation!
Linus in late nigh is so cool
Love the sock plus sandals combination man😂
Being on “real” TV was impressive 15 years ago when Rebecca Black got viral but now it feels like a downgrade 😂
That was super entertaining. Linus in the zone
Bro linus did it
Linus has his showmanship cranked to 11.
Linus is bigger than jimmy lol
What ?? 🤯🤯
Is this AI generated??
Lets gooooooooooo. Love you Linus.
ok linus actually carrying the conversation
linus pull it togetehr man
It goes to show how much of a bubble the Tech world is in when regular-ass studio audience members (and even the host himself) doesn't understand half the shit he's saying
Lets gooooo
Jimmy uhhh uhhh uhhh 💀
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!
Linus knocked it out of the park, especially considering how nervous he clearly was. Well done team!!!
I’m curious what they’ll say on wan show about this
he looks so nervous
Not going to lie this was a fun segment. To see Jimmy and Bad Bunny have fun with tech was something I didn't think I needed in my life. The icing on top was Linus was the one showing them!!!
Its like seeing your dad on TV lmao
i cannot believe linus sebastion just said waifu on prime time television
Linus full of nervous energy!
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA VI. Like, what?!!
#dontworryaboutit
what
Linus was more comfortable than Jimmy Fallon, if a, little excited at first. Bravo.
Wtf i never expected linus x jimmy especially el  conito malo W
Fuck linus. Lost all respect for him upon seeing how he handled the honey scam
Wtf
Jimmy obviously didn't care about a thing Linus said (except for the glasses), but I didn't care about that. I was just happy for Linus to make it to live TV ❤
💀 BB funny af
Linus on Coke?
Absolutely love this! You did so well Linus, amazing seeing you on this!
The tech showcase was actually super cool
ain't no way that's real Slim Sabastian  no nah absolutely not like he didn't drop a single thing
best thing today <3
Pretty cool seeing Linus on here
My waifu may be digital but my love for her is real.
The way Linus talks feels like he is still doing a review of something on his YouTube channel... hahaha! He is really the tech guy that we all love and glad to see him getting a spotlight on this show!
Linus killed it
I will watch more Jimmy if Linus is a regular 🎉
2:31 ohhh, though Waifu was Anime related. This was way worse than that.💀
Linus having to explain waifu's on Live TV wasn't in my 2025 bingo
this should be a regular segment, where he just comes in and showcases random new and upcoming tech. Linus is a natural :)
A win for nerds and geeks everywhere!
So Jimmy has to interview people who he thinks commoners that are below him. Lol You can see the disdain in his face
We got Linus on tonight show before gta 6
6:52 BALDUR'S GOAT 3 MENTIONED!!!!
Awesome Lenovo laptop!
Nervous Linus is my new favourite character
so excited for hm
We got LTT on The Tonight Show before GTA VI 😂😂
Wow... he's as start struck by Fallon as... well as star struck as I would be if I got to go on Linus tech tips
It's good to see Linus humbled and excited.
Great selection of tech from CES. Grats Linus
Linus and Bad bunny is a crazy match up
bad bunny got some free glasses
linus is so good at this sort of stuff it's not even funny
Disappointed, no segue, no ridge wallet, no dbrand.
Was hoping for more of an actual interview and less of "look at this cool tech stuff", but hey - understandable.
After his controversy Linus has gone full shill lol
Awww Linus did amazing you can see how excited he is
We need this every year lets goooo LTT❤❤❤
Is this 2025 or 2015? Can we get to a point where traditional media actually shows content creators respect? Linus snubs you in every demographic you’re clearly clamoring for, so respect that, and respect your guests how you would any other A-lister. Showing his baby picture and then going “who’d have known” when not only does his view count absolutely dwarf this whole channel off nerds alone, he’s just a real human being, and we followed HIM, and that’s what NONE of these shows will ever understand.
He's fun, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what he's telling us. He makes you want to hear every word!! I loved all the new tech and gadgets he  brought and I love how a pair of those shades went missing in BB's pocket! Funny
Woooohoooo
this is an unexpected but incredible crossover, LTT just doing everything now lol
His face is what I saw the moment I started using the internet as a kid. I just woke up and couldn't believe my eyes for a bit. Thank you Linus. For being who you are!
So awesome to see this. But I mean no segue, nothing dropped... i mean WTH
This is the best vid i’ve seen on the show 😂
Crazy blunt rotation 😂
I hope bringing Linus on to explain tech becomes a regular segment!
HOLY SHEESH LINUS ACTUALLY DID IT HUH?!?!?!!!!!
bro linus explaining what a waifu is on the tonight show is cursed lmao
Everyone is saying Linus's nerves made his voice higher, I'm saying he also looks so happy to be there ! What an accomplishment :)
He was so hyped hahahah, good for him
Linus, THE GOAT himself with 2 more GOATS. From a screen on your home on YouTube, to the BIG screens on TV. Seeing how nerdy and geeked out he was is amazing. This also shows everyone who’s into the nerdy stuff and computer stuff, that no matter how much of a stretch your dreams might, YOU CAN ALSO DO IT TOO. BIG moves to the tech channels, BIG W. 🏆
hearing Linus explain what waifu means fucking killed me💀💀😭😭
Aint no way Linus Tech Tips and Bad Bunny are in the same room 😭 We def live in a simulation 😂
3:09 So disappointed, i fully expected them to talk about the LTT backpack after he said that
Finally, Jimmay have some real life hero on the show. GGs Jim, well played. That's our GOAT ❤
Only tech creator to make it to night show. Noice!
Linus killed it! Even for someone that presents every week, he's going to be insanely nervous, but dude pulled it out the bag! Well done
Linus Nervous Tips ❤❤
Man I heard you brought your backpack, and I was like DO IT, DO IT NOOOOOOOW.
Linus seems genuinely quite nervous.
Can't imagine the excitement, must've been wild. Felt just techy enough for the new audience. Nailed it. Only flaw is the missed lttstore plug for the backpack. Oh well, next time!
Lenovo for the first time in laptops, "I'm a grow-er not a show-er"
Its so great to see Linus on the tonight show. I dont know how many people watch your channel from Pakistan, but im here, love ur videos, however i was looking forward to a segue from your sponsor. Lol
He’s so excited!
3:00 is when he becomes a little comfortable.
I'm not sure it real TV is ready for sooo much enthusiasm for tech 😂 either way, LTT rocks!
Jimmy feigning ignorance about waifus.....I dont buy it
I can’t believe I’m watching Linus along jimmy fallon and Bad Bunny. The most unexpected cross over. My brain is really scratched
Linus sucks
Great job Linus, you did geeks and nerds across the world proud
I've followed Linus for over a decade and this is the first time I've ever heard him be genuinely nervous. Tripping over his words and talking fast. Reminds me that even though he's a professional presenter with millions watching him, he still has these moments.   And somehow he's found a way to make his voice even higher pitched.
Fuckin Linus!! Love you so much legit been watching you since the begining. I do Video Game Design now and I love watching legit everything you put out every week! From super Helpful at fixing things to all my tech news. <3
Lol of course he's wearing LTT merch on TV
Ive been watching Linus for several years now, and I legit have never seen him this excited/nervous
Make up artist needs to back off a little.
@LinusTechTips I would love to hear on the WAN show, how much was scripted and how many of your "one-liners" you came up with on the spot :) Your giddyness (nervousness) was felt in the clip, but I loved it. It was very genuine and showed your passion for tech.
LMAO!! Linus needed to have one less cup of coffee. Talk about his ADHD on steroids!! 😂😂
Yo Linus killed it
Holy shit, linus is absolutely doing the interview circle
Linus is freaking out
LLT prime time! So, excited for Linus and team. lol he wore his trademark sandals with socks 3:30
Energy Drink much :D?
Funny to see Linus' nervousness disapear as the show goes on.
THIS IS CRAZY
Where Is dbrand?
I was expecting him to whip out his Screw Driver that is available on LTT Store
This is the crossover I have never ever expected! 🥰🥰
Never seen him so nervous before and yet he nailed it. Seeing Linus everyday in front of a camera kicking ass makes us almost forget there's a human there, it was nice to see him out of his confort zone and still managing a great performance. Not bad at all from a guy who just made some videos for the tech store. This is so cool, long live LTT!
Linus was brilliant 👏🏻
LINUS!!!!!!
Linus makeover by the tv show team made him look too clean lol
Youtuber gets lost and somehow ends up on real tv lmao
you can see Linus was nervous but he got more comfortable as they went on
Thanks soo much i was damn excited to see this
This is so random, it's like the beginning of a joke. "So Linus, Bad Bunny, & Jimmy Fallon are on a plane..."
Man that tech is insane, though if I ever come back to this a couple years later, it'll likely be the norm
Linus Sebastian, you’re my hero!
LTT lets goooo
😂😂😂
He's going to be invited again.
awwww he so nervous <3 LTT community is proud
Linus and Bad Bunny, wtf hahaha
way to go Linus you did so good even when you look nervous but you did great too
Linus can talk so much more than this. 😂 I hoped for a longer segment. And no plug for lttstore? No segue?  But seriously, this will have millions of views soon. And look at the like ratio. This one has 16k likes after 115k views. Jimmy has a video with over million views when you scroll down his videos list and that one has 16k likes. So its 10x likes for the same views. That will be a weird metric for them.😂 We, online viewers are accustomed to support our creators with likes.
finally Tom Cruise little brother gets his recognition
That backpack must be suffering from incurable depression, not being introduced at any point during the show.
Who are those guys next to Linus?
You can tell Linus was excited to be on US National TV show! But once the tech demo started he settled into his element. Also, I'm gonna need those gaming glasses haha looks cool as heck :-)
Speaking about waifus to regular people... we are just quite not there yet 😂
He’s so nervous, bless him aha
oh my god Linus made prime time!!
Yo who are these dudes with Linus they looked like chill guys
this is honestly crazy to just have pop up on my feed. he’s so nervous it’s kinda cute lmao
It's weird watching Linus with no segue
Linus was 🔥! Reminds me of Tech Steve Irwin 🤣
Didn't plug the LTT backpack, for shame
Every dude with a OF subscription will get those glasses for sure!
Bro with how nervous he was I can't imagine how I would be on TV like that. 😅
I can hear the excitement and nerves at the start lmao, great job Linus
Woah! Surprised by how nervous he was. Still in presenter mode and not letting himself be interviewed. Chill Linus!
So all those "cool ladies" were right in the end. It's all about sex robots...I mean waifu robots. wink* wink*
I see a returning spot coming up
I’ve never seen Linus so nervous before. Lol
Linus and Bad Bunny in the same show - that's something I would have NEVER imagined seeing.
This is so cool to see, like a kid in a Micro Center! So happy for you Linus!
I am so proud of Linus. This was an awesome bit!
This was not on my 2025 Bingo card to see Linus on mainstream tv
Thats sooo cooool! Nice one dude!
LMG gang where you at?!
This humble screwdriver salesman sure is a great performer on live TV as well.
Good to see the Sandal and sock high fashion make it to tv
Of all the stuff at CES, he picked the waifu bots
Have him back!!
nice backpack, where can i get one of those?
Wow, Linus got me checking out Jimmy again.
Let's go Linus! Uh oh, the youtube crossovers are inbound.
3 hours after the uploads and Linus's segment has at least 70k more views than every other celebrity segment that night. Great job Linus, bringing attention to everyone else :p
Hope Linus got his glasses back
It's so weird to see YouTubers in traditional media. It's funny to see Linus was the nervous one when, really, Fallon should've been sweating about being in front of somebody that big
his wife is gonna be proud af,
Haha he was so nervous at first but he definitely said some funny things and cleaned it up getting some laughs lmao
Where's Riley?
Part of me thinks linus looks horrifically nervous but then i remember when he said that people have no idea whats going on with him so im just going to assume he hiffed a big line of coke before this cause he is     i n t e n s e
Yes yes Linus! He was definitely nervous as well as super excited. This was definitely most unexpected, loved it!
linus sebastian? i thought his last name is tech tips ??!?!!??
This segment, TO OUR SPONSOR.
Snazzy Haircut linus ❤
JimmyFallonTechTips when?
Even knowing this was coming, this is still surreal The merging of media forms Well done! @LinusTechTips
he's so nervous :D
Huuuge tech upgrades
So this is basically some product advertisement in Fallom😡
More!!
The excitement is infectious. Surreal to see Linus on TV showing off glasses, it's like Nvidia 3D vision all over again :)
Have you heard the good news of our Lord and Savior, Linus Sebastian?
Please tell me he isn't wearing socks and sandals.
you should invite Jimmy to the WAN show. I mean I KNOW he can't come, but just to be nice
Linus is so nervous it's adorable
Incredible!  Bring Linus back ALL THE TIME!
they used to do these presentations with reptiles and weird animals before, now its tech!  glad to see Linus breaking out of his usual screens
The xreals did a great job of letting me marathon a tv series in a flight, without annoying anyone who is trying to sleep. Someone was even intrigued as to what I was wearing
You can tell he is so nervous ahahah.. But Linus did great! And honestly, this should be a reocurring segment, it works perfectly just like the animal handler and cooking segments of some of these shows in the past.
Im not a Jimmy fan but I am a huge LTT fan. I agree its a trip to see Linus nervous in 2025 lol. You killed it dude!
Seeing Linus and Bad Bunny shake hands is a weird thing to see
Wow, I remember watching Linus way back in 2010s when he did videos for NCIX, in order to help build my first PC. Always happy to see a fellow Canuck from humble beginnings become a star!
Dude his linus' make up is so horrid.
Am I hallucinating?
1) What
Linus!!!!!!!!!!
Linus making Canada proud
@LinusTechTips - Where is LTTStore spot ?
Linus was as nervous and excited as Intel’s GPU team on launch day
IM SO PROUD OF YOU LINUS LETS GOOO!!! HAHAHAH 💛
LINUS WHAT A GREAT JOB! The beauty of tech shown to the masses! Also absolute props to Bad Bunny for wingman'ing this entire interview, dude has so much charisma to share around
love how as soon as they started talking about tech, his nervousness went away
Jimmy should have said. We will get back with more of our conversation....after this segue....to our sponsor          RIDGE WALLET
Good to see Linus collab with these small channels, real stand up guy 👍
He talks so fast and nervous. Just like the young linus from old youtube.
LTT viewers, this is a hard reality check that we are now all boomer now.
Most common DM is: Hey Linus, can you gift me a new pc?
Linus with make up on, yikes 😂
Linus explaining what a waifu is to Jimmy Fallon was not on my 2025 bingo card
what happened to this segue to our sponsor
Neeeeerd! Lol love linus and LTT ❤
Let goooo! Funny Linus, but yes he was nervous in the start
Am so shocked to see Linus on another show lol
That's awesome, son! You started out stressed but found your flow ...   great job in a high stakes setting ❤
He got over that nervousness very quickly, and nailed the rest of it. Proud of ya Linus!
Linus Y Benito, eso si es una combinación que no se ve todos los días 😂
Holy shit I never thought I’d see the day… this is SICK!
This was not on my 2025 Bingo Card
This is so wild. Loved it 😊
not the guy who drops hard R lol
Love how nervous he is, it's a dream come true
Im surprised DBrand didn't send Jimmy some embarrassing pictures or something
Linustouchtips on jimmy kimmel???
Linus is god
First time Jimmy was outspoken by someone 😂
Crazy to see a YouTuber from Vancouver on the Fallon show
Linus helping out the little guy, love to see it
Holy cow thatd be amazing if this became a regular thing.
No se que me emociona mas. Linus conociendo a Bad Bunny o vis-versa 😂
Weirdchamp. Did they drug Linus ? He's waaaaaaaay overexcited from what we know.
YOU FORGOT THE SEGUE LINUS!! <3 <3
Linus brining that ADHD energy to cable :') He did great tho!
Why does it feel like linus is on x1.25 speed
Linus is shaking😭
This wont be the last Linus segment on TV!
Bad Bunny just yoinked those shades lmao
Its so GREAT seeing the best of tech youtube being represented well ❤
Linus?
You prepared soooo much material for this, but in the end they just wanted a few live demos. You did a wonderful job Linus, and slid in a few great jokes - loved seeing you on real TV ;)
why is she yelling?
Tech Santa, I've been good so far😩
Sponsor?
Never seen him so nervous and excited at the same time lol
i cant believe he wore the socks and sandals here
Linus with bad bunny is crazy
This was genuinely awesome
You're telling me this guy's surname is not Tech Tips?
Awesome, good work Linus, with the first time in this setting. :)
He’s so animated
since when is s guest sitting on the desk  .....or he just wanted to sit there for a joke
LTT he is a legend.
Not as awkward as I thought it would be. Linus you did great!!
I have never seen Linus this nervous !
this was fun to watch!
LTT explaining a "waifu" to a normal person is such a crazy thing to see
@LinusTechTips congrats on making it to pop tv in the states
This was really great.  Good job Linus!
When will Fallon be on the WAN show?
Its funny hearing his “YouTuber” voice in the first few seconds  Glad he relaxed a bit
This entire segment is literally a paid ad. How cringe
Don't worry about it!
idk who decided to pair linus with bad bunny of all people but it weirdly kinda works
Linus was like that dude that brings the animals on the show but instead he's bringing tech stuff
I feel like this could be a weekly segment. Linus brings some cool tech for Jimmy and celeb.  Linus and his bag of tech tips
I told myself that one day, there's a tech nerd/YouTuber to guest on any late night talk show, and now WE'RE HERE!! Killed it @LinusTechTips! You can tell your grandma that you're on TV!! 😅😅
Never heard Linus' voice so nervous 🤣🤣🤣🤣 omg
Didnt expect to ever really see this. Linus. Jimmy and bad bunny 💀 wtf lol
Wow linus on this show is crazy 😅
I really hope it becomes an yearly segment
I think its obvious by now. The new age celebrities are internet celebrities. The new age media is the 'content creator'  No I do not dislike this despite the gen z tiktok brainrot content. It also gave us citizen journalists and real coverage of hairy topics one would never get a transparent look at through mainstream media
Insane crossover
I feel like this could be a weekly segment. Linus brings some cool tech for Jimmy and celeb.
Linus, becoming the salesmen we need
Linus is like that animal specialist who comes on Late shows occasionally but it's waifu's for nerds he brought instead of exotic animals.
Two world I enjoy colliding together. Happy to see Linus getting some recognition out there.
Never would I have thought my favourite YouTuber and artist would be in the same room, my god
Bad bunny tirando "diaablo" frente a este tipo es un crossover que no tenía en mis predicciones de este año
You killed it Linus you came off awesome!!!
Hell yeah Linus!! I'd be nervous too
Represent eh! Surrey boy 😆
LTT and Bad bunny in the same video was not on my 2025 bingo
My bad bunny and Linus tech tips are two different people that I never would have thought wood crossover. It's literally different parts of my world combined into one.
Did he call him Noah in the beginning?
I wanna know if Bunny gave the sunglasses back 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy: “how do they do it”   Linus: “Dont worry about it”   *translation for linus saying dont worry about it*   “i have no clue” 😂
7:35 Diablo cbron AHAHAHH
Man, started watching LTT in the early twenty teens at the Langley house and now seeing him on network TV. Boy has this channel grown. And I love how he chose one of the meme pictures on NBC's website. 😂
Thx Jimmy to bring Linus. More pls. Jimmy Linus, Electroboom collaboration.
I would pay good money to see Linus on this shiw with more regularity.   Also, Bad Bunny pocketing the glasses was hysterical
Man its been a hot minute since i watched me some Jimmy Fallon. So gooooood 😍
Oi Jimmy be sure to shop at LTT store for cool gear. So you can look cool in front of your non-tech friends. Buy a screwdriver whilst you're at it lad.
Why do I feel proud 😂
You can tell its a body double cos he didn't drop anything
Dude this is a weird crossover lol crushed it linus
Linus's new backpack looks good !
What an unexpected crossover: Bad Bunny and LS! Now THAT wasn’t on my 2025 bingo card!!!
actual flashbang from my recommended
OMG THIS IS SO COOL 😂😂
He was obviously nervous but damn Linus pulled that off! Great job man!
Not once but twice! Impressive!
Eyyy LTT gang support our fellow techies!
It's fun to see Linus kinda out of his element. I kinda get the feeling he's like "Oh fuck, I'm back in the "I don't know anything of what's happening, where should I even look?" phase :D
This is crazy. Good on you Linus. You're usually so composed and professional, it was nice to see a clip of you so raw and in awe.
I love the "Linus'es Techtips" shoutout by Jimmy at the end
Surprised he didn’t try to promote the Linus backpack on LTTstore
our boy made it
He be wearing sandals...
Started out nervous - saved it in the end.   Linus, great work bud. Crazy to see from your model firetruck toy to this. Wild.
Wow Linus on Television!   Dudes been on camera for years so its funny to see him nervous.  Kinda like this segue to our sponsor...
😮
Love the new TechTips format, great job Linus! Anyone know the other two?
Is this going to be a regular segment ????  like those various wildlife guys on talk shows ?  That would be soo cool !  Imagine we could get to see new species from the techno jungle on the regular.
Or baby boy Linus is a grown man
this is so insane
I have never seen linus that nervous 😂
This segment video is outperforming the other segment videos 4:1. Really showing the size of the youtube community.
Bad Bunny where are you taking those sun glasses!😅
killing it, let's gooo!
Sounded a little nervous at first but once the tech came out the fun began.
Well done Linus, we're so proud of you!
This is actually hilarious, I've never seen him so happy and excited
LINUS!!!!!!!!!
So LTT wins and goes first in Jimmy Fallon. Marques always late for the party hahahaha (love both btw)
Linus seems nervous LMAO
No shot linus is on the tonight show
Never in a million years did I expect to see Linus hanging out with bad bunny lmao
Linus just got himself a regular tech gig on the show.
Like LTT said before...from crappy camera videos to this... WELL DONE LINUS LFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Of course he brought up waifus to normal people 😂
oh, so now they acknowledge youtuber's exists, when the view are down and everyone moved on. keep licking celebrity feet.
Im kinda disappointed that linus went on jimmy fallon hes som much better the jimmy
Most people in attendance don’t even know who Linus is, much less than what a Waifu is.
Linus really want to go into mainstream and legacy media huh
Linus is nerdy yet entertaining god bless you bro.
Crazy
cant wait to hear linus talk about this on the wan show
omg i love linus sebastian
WHAT!? Looking forward to the WAN show this Friday!
Look like Linus use beauty's filter lol
I just found out that YouTubers are… not made for TV.
LINUS??!!
Linus' body contains so much energy it can barely handle it lol
So good to see Linus!!. But now a Segway to our sponsor.
No way Linus is on here mind blown
They put Way to much makeup on him. He looks like a drag queen. He's a naturally handsome man. They didn't need to do that.
No plug for lttstore?? Lol
Seeing Linus next to Bad Bunny is something I wasn't expecting to see in my lifetime
I felt anxious watching this clip and stopped a couple times with a huge, stupid smile on my face.  I felt that interview. Amazing job, Linus!
oh my god it's linus sex tips!
Bad Bunny took the glasses hahahah
Bad Bunny was like "YOINK"
LIKE I'M A PROUD DAD
Linus was amazing the whole time in this. Jimmy Fallon was alright. At least he let Linus do his thing. And by the end, it looks like Fallon actually respected Linus a lot more.
We got Jimmy and Bad Bunny interviewing Linus before GTA 6. Never saw this coming at all lol
I would’ve prefer Gamers Nexus on the show and Bad bunny of course. Linus is Overrated asf.
When I heard Jimmy say “I see you brought a back back” I was just like LTT backpack, let’s go!!
Socks and sandals op
Who did that to his hair?
Ay Jimmy, DONT WORRY BOUT IT
I WAS HERE
More LINUS
Congratz Linus. I've been watching you on camera (VOD and WAN show) for years now but I've never seen you so nervous. Luke was right, once you stopped being nervous you started flowing. I wonder how many of the non-youtube-crowd who were not in the live audience realized he was wearing sandals ^^
fun fact, bad bunny was in the diddys partys, you can search on google xD
this man never changes! just like our sponsor linus's sandals, no matter the occasion they are there with him!
I wish Linus will also get interviewed by the clueless gamer Conan.
As a Latino who grew up with both of these 3 guys, I never thought they would one day Collab 😅. Like some random Skit.
Linus that’s awesome!!
LInus is a beast!, TV famous now!
WHAT IS THIS CROSS OVER
Yooo! Linus on “real” TV
Hate all late night shows but had to come check out Linus.  He was great as always.
Thats my goat 🗣
thats pretty awesome
Linus has come a long way from NCIX. Crazy 😂🎉
So great to see Linus bringing views back to The Tonight Show 😂
Am now expecting Fallon to be presenting Quick Bits
He brought tech he was excited about, but since he mentioned ces had some dumb stuff, i think the audience was expecting some of that too (dumb rolling laptop wasn't it... My mom wouldn't know if i thought it was cool or stupid as hell). Just bring anything dumb, like the bag that turns to look at people, or the stupid salty tasting spoon... The tinted glasses is what excited bad bunny and the audience the most, since its a relatable product.  Still. Nice interview with an extra screamy Linus. I hope this brings more eyes to LMG and encourages more media literacy on an audience that is clearly not yet his own ;)
Legend
is this guy a big sensation? Because all of the comments are regarding him
AHHH linus was actually nervous
kinda cringed but okay, happy for you Linus
This is just an episode of Linus Tech Tips featuring Jimmy Fallon. 😅
Fully expected Linus to do the 'LTT store' bit when Jimmy brought up his backpack lmao
Where bread
Say where could I get a backpack for holding all that awesome tech?
Still wearing the sandals with socks
dBrand didnt want to sponsor this segment?
🎉
So dope having Linus makes me wanna watch your show again let’s get some more tech people
I was hoping that the video they showed was the fire truck.
Let’s Gooooo!!! Do a tech tips segment with Linus
It's like watching Linus at 2x speed
Already has more views than clips posted 2 days ago. From just one hour
Funny seeing him so nervous
The size joke 😂 , I don't think he meant that but perfectly executed
Linus absolutely killed it.
It’s surreal seeing Linus here. He reverted from Chad LMG boss to his old NCIX nervous nerd self
Did anyone else notice the EQ on Linus's voice? 😭
Wtf this guy is killing it. Made for TV. So much useful and cut to the bone info in such a short of time 🔥🔥
Leg end
bro is on live tv daaamn!!
The fictional Internet 2025 Bingo card is off to a great start!
Awesome, more of this guy!
LETS GO LINUS!!
dad?
linus killed it 👏🏽
Linus's Tech Tips. Lol
Now THAT was a surprise.  WOW Good Job Linus!! 👏
People who went to school with linus going. Are you F£$%&*G KIDDING ME
Ages since I saw linus so nervous, I allmost cry seen him up there, very happy for him.
ONE OF US, ONE OF US,  ONE OF US!!
Nunca pensé que bad bunny le estrecharia la mano a Linus
Can't wait until the next WAN show episode! The unhinged discussions regarding this would be so interesting
I was hoping for a store shout out lmao
Been watching you for more than 10 years man. Always killer content. Love you man!  Jimmy is alright aswell.
Thanks for teaching the world that TV’s are obsolete and AR glasses are the future.
Yo Linus, drink MUCH LESS RedBull next time, but ya done us proud bud.
I love that he geeks out for real... LTT all the way🎉
I love seeing Linus support small time creators!!
I had to stop every 1 minute to take this all in 😅 That's really our guy on traditional Tv huh
Man linus was nervous af at the start, i get that, but he fucking killed it twoards the end, congrats
Wearing sandals and socks on live television  Yvette you let him wear socks and sandals
Fuck ADHD comes across as being on coke! Was hoping you would have been cool WANSHOW Linus, instead of the Linus all the cool kids have aged out of. Much love though!
❤🎉
He didn't drop it
🥱
Somewhere GN is seething that no one invited him.
He kept his regular socks and sandals like a boss !!
Make Linus a regular
Congratulations Linus! Been watching and following your tech tips more than a decade now, I'm glad you didn't drop anything on the set 😁
We got this before GTA VI
Aqui pa’l LInus Bad Bunny combo. Might listen to Dakiti while setting up HexOS later.
the most random collab
Noo freaking way haha I would have never expected Linus to be on this show haha freaking awesome
Awesome Linus!! You need your own regular tech tips slot on The Tonight Show!
Linus aside, that gaming glasses was sick
OMG this is crazy
please bring moreee nerdy people jimmy
LINUS!?!? BENITO!?!
LFG LINUSSSS
AHHHH HE FUCKING NAILED IT!! 🎉🎉 LETS GOOO!!
Oh this is kind of painful... 😅
I’m super impressed he stuck to socks with sandals, tan cargo pants, and an LTT merch hoody. Classic Linus! At lest he got a hair cut though. Congrats on making the show Linus, well done.
Never imagined but I'm fking hyped to see him on The Tonight Show!!!🔥🔥🔥
Linus is like the Doc from Back to the Future and Jimmy is like Marty Mc Fly listening to Linus teaching how things work with simple explanation.
It's crazy how nervous Linus is given how much time he has on screen talking to millions in each of his video haha
I love this
Let's go baby!! That was soo good
Linus is the GOAT!!!
LinusSexTips is moving up in the world its enough to make a grown man cry 😢
disliked. no segue
Unreal greatest guest amazing job LTT you guys smashed this!!!
I like how bad got into with the glasses. It made the whole interview or plug, feel much more wholesome and relatable. Nice Bunny, W Bunny.
He's the guest, But he's the richest 😅😅😅.
I never saw this coming what!?
LTT And bad bunny!!!!!
Can't believe Linus didnt disclose his framework investment   /s
Paused my video watching Trevor Noah interview Marques Brownlee because I got a notification to watch Jimmy Fallon interview Linus Sebastian, what is happening? lol.
I loved that he stayed true to himself with the socks and sandals!
@linustechtips you are the man, your excitement and nervousness is so genuine, rockstar, great to see you grow so much troughout the years, you really have armed us with enough knowledge to be tech rockstars
Bro was more nervous than someone who is facing death.
10000th like
I had to check if I had the video on 1.25x speed. My God he is so nervous, lol.
He's the Steve Irwin of Tech!
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaasaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where's my segue to my sponsor?
Never have I ever seen Linus nervous… until now 😂 this must have been an amazing experience though. 🎉🎉
This was genuinely the best episode of JF I have seen, and I am not just saying that as a Linus fan - This is our future yall...
Still wearing his sandals, even on live TV 😅
The crossover we never knew we need it
what the hell????
It started off shaky but he regained composure and did great! Awesome segment
You can tell he’s still just as passionate about tech and how excited he is to share it.
WOHOO LINUS!!!!!
Wait no segue to a sponsor and now ltt store call out when the backpack was mentioned?!
So many makeups
Wow, that tech was awesome. Well done Linus.
1:03 is a fair enough q hahahaha
lol :D ahahaha
Linus and Benito together was not on my bingo card for 2025. This is the crossover I never saw coming😂
I wait for our fav sponser to show there hand. Lol
We got Linus on Fallon before GTA 6.
Damn they managed to invite my boy Linus to the show and turn it into full cringe, still proud of Sebastian, they doing something right
i did not expect for Linus and Bad Bunny in one of my first videos of 2025, wtf is life lmao
hell yeah, congrats LINUS
I love the fact that jimmy looks like he has no idea what's going on
What a great interview and congratulations Linus for getting to the big leagues. Keep up the amazing work Linus and the whole team at LMG.
I was watching this while I was working out 😂😂😂
I wonder if Linus realizes just how big he is…
finally a reason to watch tv
Awww so Proud of Linus. He was nervous clearly but overall I think he did a great job with that segment of the show 😂❤
This is so much better then the cut that aired.
bro has the energy of a kid at a mall meeting santa claus
those display glasses are sick just how bad are they for u and also for me since i already have glasses,to even see :D so i can't have them
Linus Sex Tips with Bad Bunny goes crazy
Imagine being so successful that linus comes on your show.
Behold World! Canada's (short) King of Tech!
awww man he forgot to talk about the backpack... :D  loved seeing linus on such a big show.
happy to see Linus being himself. XD
Linus looks like someone wished him to become a real boy.
Good job!
THAT LINUS WAS ABIT DIFFERENT FROM HIS CHANNEL LOL btw where is the segue to his sponsor?  Was waiting for that 😂
Hahaha so fun
Linus's energy is at level 420%
Who’s here for Linus? Also who’s bad bunny? lol
Linus hit 19 lines before the show. 😂
So cool!
Bro was nervous and that was just so genius. Representing Canada. Let's goooo
linus? WHAT?
I literally said "no way" out loud when I saw the thumbnail
Linus deserved a better host ngl
Something deep inside me trembled when Linus so prominently reached for his LTT backpack and DIDNT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS LTT BACKPACK
Didn’t think I’d ever see Linus tech tips w bad bunny on Jimmy Fallon lol
the only thing missing from this is the smooth segue to our sponsors...
It's such a natural conversation It's the same so I laughed too.
I know he’s not going to watch the video but he’s definitely somewhere down in these comments reading away.
he has come so far since NCIX
Not sure who these other cats are but that Canadian Linus guy is a literal YouTube god.
No Segway to sponsor? Nahhh missed opportunity
Just like he said he would: started off nervous then fell into his element. He knew he only had so much time to show the products and he did a good job firing off the information and keeping the energy up, which is his job and he’s a pro.
You should definitely make Linus a regular guest for tech stuff.
This is awesome! Linus and the team deserve the attention — they’ve earned it.
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA6
Aww so proud of Linus and team! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
You gotta get this Linus Sebastian guy on more often at the least for post tech show highlights to see and show off! Congrats Linus!
Love Linus
HE WAS SO NERVOUS AND EXCITED I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THIS BEFORE LMAO THAT WAS SO WHOLESOME
Never thought I'd see Linus nervous lol
😮😮😮
Love it!
awesome. also cringe how the audience didn't know what waifu was xD shows how out of touch "normies" are with even basic online 101 or younger generation lingo.
There should have been much more hype
My boy linus congratulations very earned for the hard work wish more success open a ltt in Dallas TX ok
YO LINUS LETS GOOOOO
Never seen him so nervous 😂
WHAT THE F
No cap i didnt think it'd be possible for linus, i was there when he discussed it at WAN and i reckon he also didn't think this would ever happen.
cringe af tbh
LINUS!!!!!!
Both glasses are a game changer!
This should be a yearly thing.
Linus: *Looks so happy to be there*  Me: *Smiling with a tear* "That's my boy!"
Linus did a great job. Yeah he was nervous and he said he was super nervous about it talking about it on Friday but he did excellent.
Good to see Linus helping out struggling channels
Yes Linus, Love it, 💪
Not a video i expected to see
funny how i dont like the segue to sponsors on any ltt videos, but when he didnt say it here, it feels so wrong
Linus ran the show, was Jimmy even there? he was so low energy.
It's interesting to see how nervous he was at the beginning, I'm so used to seeing him calm and confident on camera in his videos. He's clearly got a little bit of the stage jitters going at first, but once he starts getting into the tech the passion comes out and he starts settling into things. By the end he was much more his usual presenter self. I'm excited for him that he got this opportunity, I hope he had fun despite the nerves!
He's not aged!!
As Luke predicted, nervous for the first minute, but once he hit the flow our boy crushed it 🔥
Awesome to see someone I look up to from youtube get some time on mainstream TV!!!
Ya linus!!!!!!❤ cant wait for wan show
ahhh yes the sellout has come full circle on "real tv"
When we thought Linus couldn't be even more hyperactive...
wtf?
I came for Linus
Was it just me or were the first 3 minutes and 15 seconds cut from the TV broadcast???
Tuniq tower video! Cant forget that
Nice job Linus!
Que ctm es esta agrupación de gente
Yes! I've watched Linus for ages. Really awesome to see him on 'normal' live TV 😮 He did awesome. Plus he picked some good products to demo for the segment/format - easy to show off the benefits of them with a click of a button.
I can't believe jimmy fallon is so old he doesn't know about anime and waifus.
Linus is the goat. Thanks for making me pick engineering with a hopeful track to the edge. Awesome that he's getting his flowers
Love to see this ❤
Omg Linus killed it... This was very entertaining.
Here for Linus
another milestone for Linus and LTT! Congratulations :)
Linus is a great ambassador for the tech world, I love how enthusiastic this man is about these gadgets.
does lenovo know that linus took that laptop?
You must put this Linus guy on more!
Linus looks good in TV lights!
Linus’s pitch is off. Does he sound more like an adult when he gets nervous
Holy shit wtf?!? Linus on Fallon?
Forgive my ignorance but I am not American and I have never seen this show. Is this show a big deal? I have never seen Linus so nervous before.
Linus doesn't look his real self in this.
Socks and Sandals all the way!
GO GO GADGET LINUS
BROO FR LINUS TECH TIPS
Hey my favorite internet celebrity is on TV (and yeah nervous haha). Loved it!
what kind of crossover is this=!
its so funny and proud like to see linus so shaky and nervous like this.. this must be the most jumpy we could watch him even compared to earliest videos
I've heard Linus' relaxed voice over thousands of hours of WAN show, and now hearing his voice revert to the higher pitch register and sped-up voice he used back in his first videos due to nerves is legitimately surreal.
This is adorable. He’s so excited lmao! Go linus!
Linus in guyliner
I can't watch this. I am feeling second hand anxiety.
He's wearing make up. Weird man.
The screen size changing laptop is only cool because the background
Linus is such a cutie
I never dreamt that i will see linus here ... Waoo
This is all was a one big sague to the sponsor, with all these products
Bro said "waifu" on Fallon
Awesome back pack!!
Our dady heree
Let's go!!! 🎉  That's freaking awesome!! I'm mkoe excited to see Linus in this video than meeting Jason Momoa in person 😂
This might be the first time Waifu was mentioned on late night TV
Aint no way Linus brought up robot waifus
DUDE HE COMBED HIS HAIR!
I’m so happy that you got paired with Jimmy Fallon. I got to admit I reckon he’s one of the best.
whats the name of the gaming sunglasses at the end??
So happy right now 😅
I am going to need a segue to the sponsor!
Best collab ever. Didn't know I needed this interview
🎉🎉
wow this is so awkward Linas is nervous as fuq- bad bunny is there alos i i kinda get that
So basically he's a Jack Hanna of tech now lol
The best
So generous of Linus to give smaller creators a larger audience ❤️❤️
Two annoying people collide.  The universe should have exploded.
Fucking great demonstration and ltt background. Refreshing to see linus representing the uber nerds.
Haven't watched Fallon in awhile but had to come see my favorite tech tuber. Really fun!
2025 LA burning down and Linus on Fallon what a year
Go Linus! So happy for him!
there is still hope for nerds!
It's so great seeing Linus support less relevant creators like this!  But for real, Jimmy, you and your team did a great job reaching out to a less mainstream community like this.  You deserve all of the respect for letting our patron saint of all things nerdy reach a much wider audience!
Linus is soooo excited omg
Handled the nerves well. I can tell it's not his usual audience or stage haha. Jimmy doesn't seem like he's too interested in tech in his daily life either, but still handled it well!
You're a natural there Linus! Should almost do more stuff on camera or something! 😅
Great job 👍
I can't believe I saw Linus on gd Tonight Show. What a time to be alive.
Linus is such a dork. It's adorable
Love it. Great job Linus. You hit it out of the park!
Linus is sooooo nervous xD the poor guy xD
Lol he didn't really talk much about the video they make haha but the tech bag was sweet! Linus was excited
Linus is a real boy now :D
LINUS <3
normies didnt get the Waifu stuff krkrkr
Um, what the fuck? Craziest crossover ever
omg Linus killed it, when they got to the tech jimmy was legit into it haha. great segement imo.
This was awesome Linus! You definitely had fun doing this and it seems bad bunny and jimmy were pretty interested in the tech you showcased to them. Tech tips have finally been televised!
Linus X Bad bunny collab was something I was not expecting
Well that was weird af to see Linus on The Tonight Show 😂
I've never seen Linus so energized and extremely nervous at the same time LOL
7:38 Diabloo cabroon 🤣🤣
Jesus Christ did he do 4 lines of coke beforehand?!
Like giving cavemen fire lol 😆
Wait, this is not AI generated!
Linus reaching out to improv sketch comedians to help give them some much needed visibility is so wholesome.
Recurring segment with Linus?? Make it happen NBC
This was dope
NO WAY !!! Its so funny seeing you so nervous up there with them. You shouldnt be tho Linus because you are the Jimmy Fallon of the tech world!  You killed it brother congrats!  Been following you since the NCIX days
So proud of you Linus! It’s true that since elementary, you’re our number one go to guy for tech videos! More power LTT LMG
Ma boy was freaking out fr this time, glad to see he got a little more comfortable later on.
That's a neat backpack! I wonder where I could buy one?!
Good to see Linus on old legacy traditional media outlets
3:57 a few more inches would be nice
"Can't wait to tell my aunt that I was on real TV for once, very real, like our sponsor! "
Reminded me how frantic I was when I met Jays2Cents at LTX19 - I squealed like a little girl
Let's go LTT represent!!!!
Pretty cool
Loved it
I wanttt
3:51 “Have you ever looked down and thought, ‘a few more inches would be nice.’”   Bruh 😂 LOL
sunglasses fits bad bunny so well
First ever steam deck on network tv probably
LINUS YOU FACKING RULE!!! HELL YEAH MY MAN!!!
First time seeing Linus nervous as hell in front of camera
where's the segue to our sponsor
Linus is so nervous! 😂
Linus on The Tonight Show 🔥
wtf is this combo of people 😂
Linus smashed it
Holy shit
Linus, Jimmy and Benito are something I never thought I would ever see when I started to see Linus 6-7 years ago
Yo Linus you’ve got more views than the bad bunny segment lol
The extended is so much better than the broadcast cut - great job Linus you killed it.
How did Linus not drop anything?
Love yuh Linus you did great! Even though no one in the crowd/jimmy/bad bunny knows what 1080p is.
Normies don't know waifus
This is the type of segment we need.  More world's Fair & Less scandalous affairs
craziest link up of all time
3:30 I brought a little bit of CES here with me today... in this segue...
Gotta love that Linus's segment already has more views than all the bad bunny clips 😆
Linus with makeup looks good
Dang Linus killed it. Our boy made it fr
in what kinda fucked up timeline are we in?
i feel linus shaking and nervous 😅
LTT letsss go.
Yoooo Linus cooked!!!
No segue, no LLTstore plug. Is this even Linus?
Oh sweet Linus 😂 came through in the end though! Can not wait to hear about this on the WAN show 😂😂
Good on you Linus, strange to see you nervous but you smashed it! Looking forward to hearing about it on Wan!
This kind of reminded me of the animal zoo expert introducing wild animals, only it's new tech devices.
Linus and his big tech tips 🫡
"When u looked down and thought a few more inches would be great"  😂😂 hilarious use of pun
Well done! I’m almost proud even though I’m just an old old follower of ltt 🤗 keep going for the start :D
0/10 Elijah didn't drill holes in the set
He seems like an ecstatic child showing their parents of the cool and I love it  Also I was sorta expecting him to build a pc on stage
Dang, our boy made it. I'm so proud 🥲
Legit LOL at the extra inches joke! Proud of you, Linus!
Linus on TV on YouTube , what is this sorcery?
I never thought Linus would go even further than he already has! So happy he's made it this far!
He was clearly very tense.
Linus was so excited and star struck he could barely breathe. A couple more appearances and he will kill.
Great job, Linus.
LINUS' TECH TIPS ARE ON YOUTUBE RIGHT NOW!?!?
Never thought I'd see Linus on a talk show. So freaking cool
Linus explaining what a waifu is to Jimmy Fallon was not on the bingo card for 2025.
Why didn't you plug the LTT store!?!?! The backpack was right there!!!!
i got an ad as the screen was growing. thot it ended there. lmao!@
It's clear Linus was a bit out of his element, but he killed it regardless! The live audience may not have appreciated the waifu joke, but it has me cracking up - especially when Jimmy needed it explained 😂
Love how LS opened up dude a legend brilliant interview.
Killed it Linus 👍 I know I'm a giant douche in the comments of your videos but I gotta give you props here 👍
You could see how passionate Linus is about tech. Linus if you see this, you are awesome! We need more people like you
Hell yeah, I’ve been watching this dude since it was just him and Luke doing unboxing videos. Amazing to see him on Fallon!!
we all love linus
Ive never seen linus so nervous before.
Yay Linus! I bet your viewers would like a recap of CES every year with Linus!
Linus bringing SOOOO many more views to a Tonight Show video that normal!!!
can't wait for the behind the scenes story on wan show
That's so freaking cool. It brings a smile to my face especially knowing I bought my very first laptop off of Linus
The sunglasses were legit cool. 😎😎
Bearded Linus was needed there
Linus combed his hair!
He needs to tone it down 😭. I’m cringing so hard
Erm... Jimmy, I think his last name is "Tech Tips" What the hell is Linus Sebastion??? Like if you agree 😂
Am I the only one who is unaware who Bad Bunny is but knows LTT?
So sick of geting things before GTA6 😮‍💨
I watch them.
linus saying waifu in national tv is fucking hilarious
Man, they missed out on showing the famous linus picture, sigh.
That was so awkward hahaha
No dbrand sponsor?
its a bit funny how LTT has a higher average viewer count than TTSSJF
Linus and Jimmy before GTA 6 is crazy
I wanna know if he wore socks and sandals
bro had his chance to slip in a sponsor segue and threw it
Linus trying to explain what a waifu is lmao
I don't think I feel more justified in unsubscribing from LTT a few days ago than I do now.
Is all of the ltt community trolling here?
I've never seen Linus nervous. It's hilarious because he's built a freaking tech empire but his lizard brain doesn't realize how big he is comparatively speaking. 😂
I NEVER would have thought that I would see Linus telling Jimmy Fallon what a Waifu is 😂
Linus became the cool kid😎
wan show is gonna be nuts this week
That "Wwwwoaaahhhhh" XD
I've been watching since the Langley house days. This is absolutely wild to see. Doing Canada 🇨🇦  proud.
WTH!!! I was just thinking about a personal screen display for my steam deck and HERE IT IS. It reminds me of the old 2008 Myvu Crystal Personal Media Viewer. Super Cool!
Bad bunny taking the glasses is really funny
I think Linus did a phenomenal job. He started a little shaky, as anyone would, but quickly took control and felt in his element explaining the tech to Jimmy and Bad Bunny. Added bonus: I never saw these tech items on the LTT channels (maybe I missed them?) and they were really cool. Great choices!
Wow....like a giddy lil girl....Linus...I expected more from you sir....
I remember when Josh Topolsky from The Verge / Engadget used to appear on the show as the tech guy. Linus did a great job
LTT represent ❤
LMAO He's so nervous
so why did this happen? cool but so not expected lol
Bad bunny asking about the emails content was a little unexpected💀
Hes looks so nervous. He needs to breathe. Also that makeup on him looks weird
Man I don't who host are But As soon i saw Linus I clicked the video Wayy to Goo Linus
FREAKING LINUS ON A TALKSHOW!!! 👏👏👏👏
Tweaker energy. When the products came out it got better
We love you, Linus!🫂🥂
why it feels like he is acting
I need those X-Reel glasses for work XD
I've never seen Linus this nervous lol. He's talking fast and you can tell he's not used to this but he did a great job! I hope he does more fun stuff like this. I enjoy seeing this side of Linus, it reminds me of his reallllllly old videos
holy shit linus is now hollywood star
Dbrand punching the air rn 😂😂
Haha it’s funny that Linus takes this opportunity on live tv in front of a massive audience to just show off some dope tech instead of talking about himself at all. Also probably the first guess who’s wearing all their own clothes and brings his own backpack on stage lol
I love that Linus stayed true to his socks an d sandals
Nice makeup 😮
Holy shit is he having an actual panic attack?
Linus is positively vibrating XD
We love you Linus! It’s a big thing to go on such a large show. Keep up the good work in 2025!
Jimmy learning the meaning of waifu was crazy 😂.
Never thought im million years i would seen linus in jimmy fallon show
Lmaooo this is insane
What the fvk is Linus doing in Arlington Texas
TBH, I saw Reddit post about this last night, I thought it was some AI scam… But this is real! Can't wait to see influx of new subs to LTT! :D
Amazing segment, great to see Linus go from giddy tan to his tech savvy self in a couple minutes. Shout-out to the the Baldurs Gate 3 team as well! 👏 More of this please!
Linus said Waifu on real TV
Wow, I've never seen Linus nervous before.  He did a good job.
It was so cool seeing Linus on the Tonight Show! We can tell you were nervous, but you did great! Jimmy, if you or your team read this: Thank you! You guys should totally get Jimmy to make an appearance in one of Linus's videos sometime!
The Bad Bunny Segment 10k views.  LTT Linus 35k views.  I think the definition of famous has changed.
Little nervous but I would be, too. Here’s to round 2!
I WAS HEREEEEE
Great day for us, Linus didn't drop anything
this was absolutely wild, great job linus 🥺💕
Badbunny looks like a bootleg sr.pelo
Linus, your energy was infectious. Love to see it!
Nervous Linus is my spirit animal.
We had Linus on this show before GTA6
The result of 1 gallon coffee before entering the scene!
wtf is this
I get he probably couldn't say it due to legal stuff, but man I was expecting an ltt store plug.
Linus and Bad Bunny geeking about tech was not on my 2025 bingo card
Very nice show was made. Good work Linus
THATS OUR BOY
I love you Linus you did so well and you was so nervous and shaking!!! your the best I'm glad your our tech dad
No bag pack plug
Linus promoting other businesses on the tonight show
Bad Bunny casually putting CES glasses in his blazer
Cant wait for WAN this week, its gonna be amazing hearing the behind the scenes on this!!! Good job, Linus!!
The PASSION is what the show needs, Linus is SO passionate he was able to force some of that excitement upon the host and other guests. Bring Linus back.
Lets go boys
I’m surprised he didn’t pitch his black backpack.
Linus!
bad bunyy robandoselo como buen latino que somos😂😂😂
Love this for Linus.  Was watching LTT religiously while I was in college back in 2010.  Have him come back to showcase cool tech in the future!
Only Linus can wear sandals on the tonight show ❤❤❤
Recurring segment when ?
Um happy for linus. But damn he had too much sugar and coffee probably
What timeline is this?!
Dawg, love this, but what in the fck is this combination of people 😭😭
Wowww
The King of Tech has made it to the original small screen! Oh Canada! 🇨🇦
How excited lunus is
linus is making it big
You can feel Linus's nervousness through the screen but he absolutely killed it 😄
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6
i can believe this actually happened
I just saw the "Fanboy mode Linus" 🥰🥰
Linus seems like the Steve Nye or Steve Irwin . Love to see it. Watching for over 15 years
hes so shaky and nervous, i've never seen him like that before
LTT on Jimmy Fallon!!! OMG!!
Someone finally combed Linus’s hair.
I never comment but this is crazy, well done Linus
Linus and Bad Bunny together? 2025 is starting out crazy lol
Linus made an awkward first appearance to a normie audience.
That was crazy cool
Dudeeeee
this is looking like a fortnite lobby
Linus may be the only creator that could get me to watch Jimmy
Of course he wore sandals.
Definitely bring linus back again as  the tech version of like an animal expert segment.
And those glasses were taken forwver
Why does this look fake lol
WE'RE DOING IT FAM!!! Way to go Linus and team for paving the way for us!
MY GOAT IS ON TV
Ok, The Tonight Show just became relevant to me again.
I dont even know who Bad Bunny is lol
wild!
Invite Steve Burke from Gamer Nexus next! And Marques Brownlee MKBHD!
So happy for him and his team. They've come a long way and it's crazy to see so many YouTubers we literally parasocially "grew up with", be on these shows etc
Linus explaining what a waifu is to Jimmy Fallon and Bad Bunny is not how I expected to start 2025 but here we are
Isn't Linus's last name Techtips?
This is honestly so cool. I love the fact they used the goofy pic
Linus’s least viewed video in years
No one is gonna comment about Benito keepin te shades for himself?
Long time Linus supporter, been there since he made videos in a Kitchen, never seen this man be this energetic/nervous before lol
Whoa my two worlds colliding in the same parallel dimension.
THE TECH TIP HIMSELF
Great job Linus!
what a cool and practical commuter backpack he's got there, does anyone know where I could buy one?
Linus being on Jimmy Fallon was not on my 2025 bingo card
Let's freeking go
People are going to see a very different Linus when they go to the channel for the first time
Great job Linus!
jimmy must have worked very hard to convince linus for this collaboration
No LTT store promo
Aww, look his feet don't touch the floor! 😂
Let's go ❤
The audio in ltt videos are so much better than this
what the fuck is LINUS doing on Jimmy kimmel
Gotta admit it was kinda cute seeing Linus so jumpy and excited, he's so in his element on LMG that I almost forgot he's just a nerd like us, love to see it, congratulations man, much love
is this a dream?
Ladies and gentlemen, Linus on crack.
This is actually crazy
Jimmy- "How do these work??!" Linus- "Don't Worry about it."
Way to get them nerves under control!   Funny to feel proud of a celebrity, but as a 15yr+ viewer, I'm proud of our boy Linus for doing great on Fallon :)
They should really get people actually intrested in the guests as co-hosts instead of jimmy saying yeah that's cool
Linus with Bad Bunny wasn’t on my 2025 bingo card and I love itttttt
i love how you can hear the tone change in jimmy's voice when he's saying "whoa" for the bit with the laptop, to his final "whoa" of him being genuinely amazed by the product, as well as the entire character break with the heads up display sunglasses
who tf is bad bunny ?
LTT!
Soo, bad bunny PC build soon?
We got Linus on Jimmy Fallon show before GTA VI
Young Linus looking like he sold ShamWow. 😂
What the absolute heck. Linus…..? Hoed you get here young man?
Cant wait to hear about this on the next WAN show
Linus, how many bumps you take before you went out?
Linus, please dont sell ur soul to Hollyturd
Who’s those xreal glasses is a definite purchase for me!
I’m sorry. Linus. Why the heck did you answer this call.
This was awesome!!!! Love LTT!!!
Great job, Linus! I really wish it was longer, and more of the interview made it to air. Bittersweet.
Great job linus!!!!
Finally, Zuckerberg's son
Linus is so nervous LOL
You can hear from Linus voice that he is actually nervous.
He was so nervous but i totally understand it. What a treat to see him on the show!
HE DID IT HE KILLED IT
Bravo Linus killed it👏
This is so fckn random, such an unexpected encounter.
you can really hear the post ces loss of voice
Love how he's putting up his dramatic youtube personality for this interview
Linus you were great was so happy to see you on the show what a moment 😍🧡
Lol never seen Linus so nervous and giddy
You can tell he’s nervous but he killed it. Still the jokes landed
Linus explaining waifus to Jimmy Fallon was not on my bucket list
LINUS!!!!
Linus rocks!
This should be a semi regular segment bringing Linus in to show off new tech once or twice a year!
I figured it out, Linus is doing a mark rober but doing the other Jimmy
next step Linus Movie Star
Its about damn time 👏👏👏 Proud of you Tech Guru!
I watched this live! They cut out a little more on air than here, but still super cool to see you on a talk show. It's kind of intimidating that they had Jimmy Fallon with bad Bunny like that. 😅 I'm sure that wasn't helping your nerves, which I remember you mentioned on the wan show. You killed it!
Jimmy does not seem too impressed🤣
Hatsune Miku was on David Letterman in 2008, we still haven't established that waifus are a thing?
whos the nerd with the ltt hoodie
*If this video gets 1,000,000 likes Linus will install a battery backup at Jimmy's house.*
This is something I really never expected!
I learned a LOT about computers from Linus!! He really knows how to ignite that passion, learn and have fun!! 😂🎉🎉
Never thought I’d ever see Linus being interviewed by Bad Bunny 😂 Weirdly proud of him, Unc made it to the big leagues
A reoccurring spot for Linus on the Jimmy Fallon show showcasing new tech! You heard it here first 🔥🔥
This wasn't on the show! Just showed the ces stuff.. cool they posted the longer version
The WAN show sent me here!!!
Woooo Linus!! 🎉
WELCOME TO LATE NIGHT LINUS! <3 Love to see you in USA space
This is so random lol Linus and Bad Bunny and Jimmy Fallon Tonight Show
Linus on Jimmy Fallon isn't on my 2025 bingo card.👏🏻
Never expected Linus and Bad Bunny in a video together but man do I need more of it!!!
Big W for LTT in 2025 🥰🥰
This is dope! Linus stayed true to himself with the socks and sandals
Love how Bad Bunny was trying to get Linus to relax. You can also see once Linus start to talk about tech he gets in the zone. And his voice calms down a bit. Love you man
Man I wanted pairs of sun glasses so cool.
wait wtf lololol I was not expecting this
Linus x Bad Bunny is a WILD crossover!
Linus on the tonight show!?!?! What timeline are we living in???
LINUS TECH TIPS AND BAD BUNNY???
I can tell how nervous he is lmaooo. Congrats Linus!
OMG! That's awesome! So nice to see Linus as a guest! Too bad that now I really want those glasses at the end.
Linus giving showing tech and giving tech tips should be a new segment. He's a natural.
LINUS IS ON THE SHOW FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
wheres the ltt store XD
Wow...never ever expected this. He's made it. 🤣🤣
Linus is a real celebrity now
i hope LTT and the tonight show would do this after every CES from now on.
This is one crazy crossover episode! Hope Bad Bunny was awesome to interact with
Looks like cgi
Holly shit LINUS HERE? WTF this is amazing!
when i saw this i thought i was dreaming.. been watching this guy for years, amazing to see he’s finally getting the recognition he deserves!! love you lots linus, congratulations!
So proud of Linus
Did Linus also go to Xreal? It was my first time noticing Xreal at CES, and the floating giant screen was really impressive~~
Nice job buddy! You made us proud.
We’re so proud Linus! You did great! Congrats!
Amazing to see linus in tv. Hope we’ll see him more often!
He was like a kid showing his parents the cool rock he found
Awesome! Congratulations Linus!
He’s so nervous it’s funny
Hope this becomes a yearly thing!
Holy fucking sooooooooooooooy
I've been watching Linus since more than a decade now and it's so amazing now seeing him on Jimmy
Linus that was fantastic. A great lesson on how to step up to the plate.
dude what lets go !!!!!
Too bad the audience is frankly too dumb for Linus. He was funny, engaging, and the tech was super cool! He did a great job!
Look he is human like us. bro is nervous like we are in presentation
Eyy, he did great! Got his jitters out, and then was wonderful! 😃
I couldn’t believe when this showed up in my recommended, love that he reped the LTT hoodie
Bad Bunny’s English got really good
This is crazy hahaha
Omg I didn't notice in the TV cut bad bunny put those glasses in his pocket
LTT and Bad Bunny on the same room? wth
3:33 SANDALS 😂😂❤ Linusssss
See now the funny thing is, im going to now show this to my mom
Only Linus can make Jimmy Fallon bearable for 9 minutes
Wow
Linus is the best!! So well deserved!!
Dad is on TV!!
Dude I’m so proud of Linus this is awesome
The most relevant Jimmy has ever been
watching linus's videos are what taught me how to build a computer
Perfect jokes that hits with both Linus' audience, and Jim's audience
Linus was nervous 😂😂😂😂 it's been a minute since we saw him acting like this in front of a camera.
Is he gonna drop Jimmy or Bad Bunny?
Love Linus
What
I can't believe he didn't drop anything!
Linus made it mom 😢
He’s so clearly excited but nervous too. Shit I would be! Going from YouTube videos about tech to being on one of the biggest shows ever. Congrats Linus. Been a pleasure following you all these years
Well done Linus, we‘re proud of you!
Been watching him since that early NCIX photo. I've never seen him so nervous 🤣 he did great!
Nice to see Linus going more mainstream! We need more people interested in Tech.
Sponsor? Shameless plugs? linus must be bubbling inside not getting those out
Linus is so sweet 🤗🤗 freaking love you, great job!!
I was fully waiting for the segue to our sponsor
Well done, Linus! Fan of you for like 15 years since the NCIX days, and now seeing you here on this stage is absolutely incredible!
Linus our goat!!! Smiling the entire time watching this
Bad Bunny is having so much fun
No body gonna talk about how bad bunny is just there
The fact that linus is obviuosly nervous, I'm just glad Linus didn't drop anything 😂😂
YEEEEEEES LINUS!!!!!!
Why do I feel like this is an elaborate prank by dBrand??!!
Don’t I have ever watched Linus be so nervous
Noticed a good point to plug the merch... tv changed you Linus
Wild to see Linus on here. Great job Linus I'm sure that was a lot of pressure!
This is wild! Killed it man! Definitely more nervous than his standard WAN show self, but he’s in his showman mode. What a great entertainer!
You know the LTT viewers come to support!
Why does Jimmy seem more uncomfortable than Linus😂
🦅🦅 LINUS ON NBC RAHHHHHH 🦅🦅
We love you Linus. Been watching your channel for YEARS! Happy for you. Hey, what were those glasses called? I've been seeing them everywhere online and I think I've just been convinced to check them out
Never ever expected to see Linus so nervous in front of a camera, lol - his voice goes up an octave! But he did great regardless!
definitely some good pics to bring for the show, cool choices that are quick to show off
This was awesome
2:20 lolol the wink before 'interact with' lol. Love Linus
With traditional media slowly dying, no doubt Fallon will start to have internet celebrities on now
Its kind of funny how Linus probably pulls more views in a day then jimmy Fallon pulls in a week lmao
Socks and sandals proving to be the utmost formal footwear once again
Congrats linus.. So happy for you.. Love from Egypt.
LINUS WE ARE SO PROUD!!!!!
Linus can't handle it 😂😂😂 gawd damnnnn
UN FUCKING REAL
LTT + BB = 🔥 my nerd side and party side in a video 😨 mind blown
4 Foot 9! Great job!  -A Robot
Just built my first SFF PC thanks to Linus after a decade of watching his videos
We got Linus with Bad Bunny & Jimmy Fallon before GTA 6 😂
what the fuck
We got LTT explaining waifu on TV before GTA 6
Wow he didn’t plug the backpack. I’m shocked.
Linus thank you so much for showing us nerds you can be the man in so many different ways. It was incredible how you navigated this through obvious anxiety and showed how passion and genuine love for tech can power through and bridge the gaps between traditional media and YouTube . I hope you walked away from this feeling as proud as you earned.
Ay, glad to finally see the whole section. I watched on NBC and they cut out 2.5 minutes of this live, so I'm happy it's all here for us to watch.
Linus looks so excited and nervous at the same time! 😅 Killing it though!
I was hoping that Bad Bunny was secretly a Linus fan lmao
LINUS MADE IT TO THE TVS
socks with sandals all the way to Jimmy Fallon show XDDDDD
He brought ALL his energy for this! So cool to see a tech show and tell segment on late night!
Was so cool meeting Linus at CES, such a fun video!
I wonder if Bad Bunny managed to go home with those glasses 😂
Way to go @lLinusTechTips!  You killed it!  And you did it while being you.  That was super impressive dude!
SEEING LINUS NERVOUS WAS NOT ON MY 2025 BUCKET LIST LMAOOO
It was great to see Linus up there tonight! The tech he brought from CES was great and it’s always cool seeing non-techies reacting to the cutting edge :)
Bad Bunny!  Return those glasses!!😊
Glad to see our boy @LinusTechTips on the show tonight
This doesn't feel like the right audience for Linus. But cool to see him on "real TV"
Proud of Linus! But also this is so painful to watch LOL
Most common question must be how he convinced yvonne to marry him
Good LTT backpack placement
Lol, I've never seen linus look nervous! Once he got into it he did great though!  What's funny is that this will probably get less views than most of his normal videos
So excited for the goat to be on
That's our guy!!!
Linus the Goat
Well this is something I didn't expect lol
Congratulations Linus, it feels great to see one of us in those shows.
Very well done, Mr Sebastian. Honestly you were one of the better guests on this show with the pure joy you brought. Plus it was great to see when you talked tech those moments were so very casual for you
Been a few years since we've seen Linus so excited.  Nicely presented.
Linus is the best. Thanks for having him
someone gave lines a red bull
Now we just need a Tonight Dough/LTT ice cream collab!
Linus made it to THE big screen in his quest for the largest display possible :)
Seeing linus on tv wasnt on my 2025 bingo card
Nahhh they should have given Linus the last chicks segment. She was the definition of boring 😂 They cut his intro so we could listen to her ramble. Linus did the best with the tight time he had. Feels so weird seeing him on TV
❤❤❤
Managed to catch this live. Linus looked a bit nervous, but he had the merch going strong!
This is so good and these comments are so wholesome.
Jimmy learned the meaning of waifu that day.
you can tell linus is soo nervous lol
Love to see Linus make it. He represents all of us tech geeks who want to be seen ❤
my goat
that linus's tip tech fella seems pretty savvy
Ohh JImmy you better bring this man back..
LINUS MADE IT!!!
amazing
What?!?! Our boy Linus!!! Lets GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
So great bro !! You deserve this Linus !!!!!
that oled screen is one of the most useless looking features I've ever seen
linus is the man
I'm glad he settled half way, he was too excited but I don't blame him obviously.
Not a single plug for LTTStore?! This cant be the real Linus!
Proud of Linus !!! for rocking that uniform
It's nice of Linus to help a small creator like the tonight show
Linus you seem so nervous but I love you
I knew that the Fallon show is staged but Linus seems wayyy more enthusiastic than is real. Jimmy Fallons reactiona don't seem real because they probably aren't. But hey, happy to see how far Linus and LMG have come.
I can't believe LINUS is on The Tonight SHow! So proud of you dude. We need to hear this story and how it came abut on WAN Show!!
That's our boy! Let's gooooo
totally expected Linus to mention where everyone could get that fancy commuter backpack he had
😍
Linuuuusss
That was actually really cool! Linus did great.
My boi is shaking, so nervous. We're proud of you tech tip man
Love it! Linus was having a blast and the interaction of everyone was just amazing!
For the record, Linus did NOT drop anything.........
The audience are full of iPhone chicks wanting to get their panties wet by bad bunny.... They don't understand tech culture
As a Puerto Rican, I was not expecting my favorite YouTuber in the same room as Bad Bunny 🤣
I have never seen Linus so nervous before 🤣 Love how genuine his excitement is!
LETS GOO LINUS
Linus during the interview reminded me of me when I went to my First robotics competition. Anxious but excited, its awesome to see this energy coming from him.
He would’ve brought Super Chexx too but it wouldn’t fit in the LTT backpack 😞
Let’s freaking go
Crazy to say, but this is gonna be LTT the Sponsor, and so, for The Tonight Show...  Shootout and Congrats to Linus, and All the Fantastic Team at LMG !
First big boy talk show in the books for Linus, I honestly see a place for this being a more regular thing, keeping people up to date on tech in a simple and fun way!
Linus talking about waifus on Jimmy Fallon with Bad Bunny what timeline are we in
Linus has taught me so much that i know about computers, i've even been able to fix multiple devices just through the knowledge  he taught me, genuinely inspiring.
We love linus sebastian
Linus tech tips at Jimmy Fallon love to see it
A few more inches? Is he a virgin?
Love this. He reminds of John Carmack.
So did bad bunny give the glasses back?
I was expecting an lttstore plug
Linus all made up and giddy is hilarious 😄
Funny that Linus is responsible for having “Waifu” on national television 💀
Lets gooo 🔥
This was so neat to see him on live tv! Half of it was cut on tv but still a great time seeing him. Though it was a bit funny making my family stay up late to see a YouTuber I follow😅
WAN Show is going to be nuts this week.
Bad Bunny & LTT is a crossover I never knew I needed.
I'm so happy that he's made it this far, to be on the tonight show, now that's amazing
Shame they made the actual broadcast all about the tech and not about Linus Sebastian.
Bro is truly excited
Congratulations to Linus on appearing on Jimmy Fallon!!! Well deserved!!! Some outstanding tech from CES shown off too!!!
YOOOOO
You were exceptional, Linus! Great job!
Linus, you killed it man! I had a road trip today and caught up on the WAN show and heard about you being on tonight. You started out nervous as heck but got in a groove and made it all very entertaining.
Holy shit did not expect this on my bingo card
His tip now has extra inches.
Linus killed it.  Felt like Steve Irwin of tech on the show.
Why is Bad Bunny looks like Wemby
I have the XReals they are amazing btw
Linus is soooo excited!!! I'm so happy for him!
We stan Linus. Huge moment. Congrats!!
Thanks so much for the opportunity. You and your team were amazing today and made this experience unforgettable! -LS
Linus telling Jimmy Fallon about waifus was not in my 2025 bingo card
Omg, never would have thought this would happen :D
Jimmy got excited about those extra inches.
Linus clip has more views than bad bunny clip. Linus has more AURA
Linus' hands are shaking. He's obiously nervous. But he hit it out of the park. Great job Linus! You're a real celebrity now!
You nailed it Linus!
On Live TV, they Introed Linus with the Peanuts theme 💀
🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼
We made it boys
Short, just like this segue, to our sponsor..
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Don't know why I'm in tears
Obviously nervous but crushed it anyways. Nice work!!
Linus stepping out repping in the sandals and socks. Been watching this guys since NCIX days with Esther.
Hey, nice backpack! Where can I get one of those ;-)
El mejorrrr ❤❤❤
I’m hoping some kids out there who like technology got a kick out of this while watching with their parents. Always happy to see things like this on prime time to get to the people who might not normally see it!
Got to admit, the tech is pretty neat
LINUS LINUS LINUS!!! (holy crap you're nervous dude... I look forward to the wan show...)
He acts like an excited youtuber, so wholesome.
Linus is way too excited here 😆
I don’t know if I’ve ever seen Linus this nervous, and I’ve seen him handle (and drop!) electronics worth tens of thousands of dollars.
LTT BABY!!!!!
Linus must feel like he’s trying to impress the cool kids at high school again with his tech.
Linus Sebastian? I thought his last name was Tech Tips
Imagine a four-hour WAN show with Linus this energetic.
So cool to see this guy on real TV, like he said.
This is awesome! His videos helped me build my first pc.
Damn i was nervous for him
way better then the cut NBC put on tv
Yay
Huge W for Linus! As nervous as he was on WAN Show for this, he did so well!!
Only reason I stayed up to comment this early.
I'm here for LTT!
LINUS
You look down and say, “a few more inches would be nice.” 😏
I love how giddy he is, he did great :D
Here is your Linuuuussssss, get off the other clips if you dont want to watch themmmmmm
Watched it live on NBC and can't believe how many ads there were. I don't remember TV having so many ads vs actual content.
OH MY GOD HE WAS SO NERVOUS CONGRATS MR TECH TIPS YOU DID GREAT <3333
nice to see Linus supporting smaller creators 🥰
No way this has happened - must be AI generated
Holy crap, it's true... saw this on reddit and thought this was a prank, lol.
I've never seen Linus like this! This is wild! I'm so proud!
I stayed up for this.
Linus took a line before this.
Linus
Oh man that “Waifu” joke didn’t land in the live audience
No screwdriver?  Nothing dropped?  This is not an LTT video at all!
I love how excited he is ☺ So wholesome!
And now this segue...to our sponsor...
Fresh off the CES to bring it back
The King is in the house
Omg how cute is his excitement.
I’m reminded of that post from Linus at his high school reunion talking about how he’s a youtuber. “Do any of them know you are a famous YouTuber?” “uh...  No... In the grand scheme of things I'm not terribly well known lol”
wtf
Linus needs to be a regular guest!
Linus ‘Hard r’ Sebastian
Linus is insane here
Our boy made it to real tv. Guess wan show wasn't enough for him
Where is the LTT intro? 🎶
My GOAT LINUS
He should have dropped the word
this is epic
Linus showing off his tech tips.
that’s OUR guy
Linuss!!!! 🎉
Welcome to the big time Linus!
HE'S SO NERVOUS LMAOOOO
I'm 36 secs in. He's shittin BRICKS, son. 😂 EDIT: I'VE FINISHED THE VID! OUR BOY DID US PROUD! HE'S A REAL BOY!!!
