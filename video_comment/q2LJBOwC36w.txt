Benn you getting tag by these slow hands. Benn you throwing wild punches. Poor boxing skills here.
I was for eubank
Chris looks way better in this fight by miles
Been won this fight as well
Why did Chris look so bad in the second fight something was clearly off
The difference in Chris in this to the second is insane something’s off
Insane how much better Eubank looks in this match compared to the rematch.
Where was this guy last night smh
Looking back at the scores no way was that unanimous or the correct scores by the judge. Not even close
Bringing 50 cent and lose like this its emberassingg
El ejemplo de qué Canelo le puede ganar a Crawford, le faltó poquito al carnal mucho jab y Eddie Reynoso es un baboso
Wow
What a fight... Both families should be proud 👏🏾
Who say if Connor and eubank can handle Pacman skill? Theres no way they cant handle pacman
Connor cant handle manny pacqiuao skill😂😂
The highlights looks like it should of been benn  win but the full fight live it look like a eubank won just about hope benn get the decision tonight ❤
Part two will be just a rewind
These guys gas tanks are insane
Had to rewatch these highlights for the upcoming part 2. On the first watch gave i it to Ebuank but watching it for the second time Benn could of gotten him out of in the earlier rounds but couldn’t capitalized. Close fight , excited for the upcoming match.
Espectacular, estos dos peleaban por algo mas que el money y los beneficiados hemos sido los espectadores. Uno de los combates del año sin duda alguna.
It was like a traveler fight propa scrap British classic
No way this was a ud
This is boxing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Benn right hand is a masterpiece
No Via UD Win BY EBJR
ROBBERY, Connor Benn won 100% !
More like a draw to be honest
I hope they are Hatton and Pacquiao's children. ❤
💪🥊
Robbed Conor 🥺
...fair to say that these 2 boys don't like each other.😁
eubank jr just too big for benn
i agree with eubank winning because he landed more and scored more points, but if you're unbiased there's no denying that when they started swinging eubank was the one getting rocked a couple times then just put his weight on benn to balance himself
Hate when refs insist the fighters touch gloves, youre not the main character bro 😭
May i know...why they repeat for second fight? 😮
Benn is the better fighter just smaller
Benny better make sure he lands them power hooks this time...it'll be a blast 🎉
Eubank has a on drugs
From this highlight I feel Benn was robbed but great competitive fight
Benn will take him out on the rematch   Way too emotional this fight   Controlled agression  He will get the stoppage
100% is the best fight I've seen of any second generation of their fathers. Great fight.   Also, great fight of my life I've seen live!   What an amazing spectacle, performance, boxing bout of the year!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
This was a FIGHT not a boxing match
Watched it live but after watching highlights conor had way better cleaner shots and was way more active
Find it made how many times Ben had eubank wobbling but Ben just ate all of eubanks shots
From the highlight it looked like Ben won the fight
What a fight
Conner gave him that work if Chris was to come down he couldn't f with Conner....Benn is a dawg💯💪🏾
They came to die
I’m 64 years old and this fight was the greatest fight of my life right up there with the greatest fights in boxing history. I had Eubanks winning but Benn deserves that rematch and this fight was closer for me. Great great fight
I have Ben winning the second fight i think
How on earth do they better this.
Respect to the ref for making them touch gloves
Benn ain’t the same without PEDs
Eubank looks so much bigger
Them boys went to work 💪🏾
This was one of the best fights I’ve ever seen
O el que editó el video le iba a BENN o el veredicto de los jueces fue un auténtico ROBO. Por lo visto en este video debió, mínimo, sido un EMPATE, si no es que un triunfo para el hombre que venía (y se notaba en su físico) de una división menor: BENN.
This is a fight !
Tbh I didn’t see the fight but by these highlights Ben looks like he won but idk
Bro if Ben had power in those eubank would’ve been injured
How wasn't this a draw??
крис уже не тот: голова не держит даже слабые удары :(
No way Conner beats Shakur.
More of heavyweight no technique
He didn’t win this decisively at all
What a fight the 2 of them should be proud of themselves can't wait for the rematch
Brain vs brain, punch vs punch, endurance vs endurance. This fight is brilliant classic performance from borh side.
Ben won to me
A full strength Eubank would handle Benn easily.
Funny how chris denys being hit or wobbled haha.
Conor win this fight
Robbery . Ben won that fight
This is what's missing from boxing
I had Benn winning lowkey
Se notaba la diferencia de peso, aun así Ben peleó los 12 rounds en una pelea cerrada. Eubank jr quedo a deber en su carrera, no llegó a ser campeón mundial, no se porque nunca enfrentó a Golovkin.
Well I hope Ben is getting the best possible pay for this fight, another fight against a naturally larger fighter at 28 years old, this fight is gonna finish his punch resistance and his career as a future contender just has his coming into his prime. Besides money this fight has zero benefit for Ben.
3 minutes did not do it justice! What a fight!
Conor benn True fighter real fighter
i hated modern day boxing but this has restored my faith once again
Trump will be at one of these FIGHTS SOON
HOW DID EUBANK WIN ???????
Bad intentions
If only Benn Won that 12th round he would of had a chance
A esta pelea si que le hace falta una revancha 💪
Coño por poco se arrancan la cabeza ,de milagro no se noquearon yo los jueces hubiera dado empate 🤪
Chris ubank will survive totank Davis open
Violent fight
Benn Won and he will Win again
This was a draw man if anything nobody won
This was a great fight possibly fight of the year.
Anyone in there 25-40 this is the fight of our generation… Epic entrances
This was intense. They both warriors. Ben was rude that’s why he lost
How did I miss this
TOUCH THEM NOW AHHH AHH AH AHHHHH
Robbery
I came here after the absolute joke of chimaev vs DDP
It's clearly benn lose this fight
You can't force them to touch gloves while they having beef.... Ref
Like fathers like sons great rivalry let’s see ifs there’s a rematch
Funny how the DAZN highlights show benn winning basically
When you mention all-time boxing rivalries you have to mention Eubank V. Benn. It started in the 90's with Chris Sr. VS Nigel with their epic fights. Now Chris Jr. VS Connor.
Who has this guy fought
Now that's a fight😮 both men are monsters and they give all into that fight wow
They came with it!!!
generational beef😂
Benn looked sloppy to me here Glad he lost
Look like one of the best 12-round fights
We don't need Benn Eubank 2 in September. I'd like to see Connor try and do something at 147 or even take that fight with Shakur Stevenson if Shakur wants it.
Ben punches hard
FIGHT OF THE YEAR RRRR
No way people thought Chris was gonna let Connor benn put a loss on his record😂😂
Benn was completely robbed???
Have they heard about a jab?
Should’ve been a draw
Benn won that
After watching this… Shakur will get destroyed by Benn!
I still think Conor Benn won this. He made Chris Eubanks have bambi legs the whole fight lol
Why did Benn get robbed
Ez fight for ub
He definitely not gonna beat Shakur
great fight
Most Robbery of the Year!  The Result should be Split Dec by Benn!
What a fight. I want a rematch just for the entertainment.
Benn did well but Eubank is class!
Benn won 8-4
Instant classic. Cant wait for the rematch
Whole fight was amazing but 1:05 was the best part
Eubank look so much bigger
Robbery 😮😮😮 that man had eubanks fighting on baby dear  legs 😂😂😂
Bud Crawford vs Eubank Jr 2026
Shades of Gatti vs Ward, classic
Que impresionante los 2 son unas máquinas 😮
esa pelea no fue legal jn tenia una libra mas
Those are winners
Incredible fight of pure brawl & braun!
eubank is more bigger than benn overweight?
Conor ben ⚡🤜🏽
A pesar de no ser un boxeador de mi agrado; pienso sin dudarlo que el ganador fue Conor Benn, tres rounds dónde estuvo a nada de noquear al Euban; Chris sólo casi gana la pelea el el último asalto.
EUBANK JUST LOOKS LIKE A WEIGHT CLASS OR 2 BIGGER THAN BENN.
That was an excellent match up  Great fight
Connir win da fyt
Tbh these highlights make it look as if benn won
This fight was indeed a sweetie.
i say draw
Eubank looking really big there, not a fair fight but benn gave it all, if they were of same weight, benn would have won for sure
A spectacle from Chris.
I got to see this whole fight. Just based on the highlights, it looks like Benn did more damage. But you can never tell from a highlight
Great fight
Mafia sport it's boxing
I dk  know..conner did so much
Besides the BS build up - this fight became an instant classic. Well done gents
0:15 "ahh ahh ahh... ahh ahh ahh"
Gatti ward vibes. Obviously not on that level but the closest I've seen in this era
Super combat
That fight could’ve went either way that was a slugfest great fight straight war
This is what you called boxing,unlike to those who always run and afraid of getting hit😂
the size difference was ridiculous
Just watch highlights on what I saw thought Benn won by split. I would need to see  the whole fight but both fighters are in top shape so respect to them both
Kamay
For me it's a draw decision
Boxing councils must give bonus for those fighters give a show like this.
Wow how tf did i miss this!? Saw no highlights on social media. They have done both their dads proud. Warriors the both of them. I’d love to see a rematch
There was no loser here in my opinion
No lo vi ganar mas q abrazar a ben
They need another run it back another rematch
Gahhh dayum!!!!!
fight of year
para petinju hebat ❤❤
Fierce 😀
Any 1 else scream the hse up
Just like his dad
Amazing fight
Benn won
Not only was this fight great, but it was also very well marketed. Entertaining interviews and press conferences with some father son drama. The blueprint of a great boxing match.
Best fight ive seen since wilder fury deffo was a draw i think
Ben was robbed
Eubank has no defense, he just grabs every time
The crowd is sitting dead while the fake crowd noise is blasting. 😂
Жанибек Қазақ-Стайл Юбен
🥊
Amazing fight. Connor will win a world title in his weight class. He's a force to be reckoned with. Well done lads. Proper old school fight! Respect to both of you.
Should’ve been a draw
Conor Benn be throwing heat and Uebank Jr should have kept Conor more at bay (distance) since he had the longer reach. BRILLIANT Fight💯🥊
Fantastic fight !
Wow Chris was a surprise tbh. He was a savage in the ring. Conor too but Chris jr is a beast
Connor won
Señora pelea, yo les hubiera dado un empate.
😂😂😂funny how Ben thinks and talk about himself leading up to this fight 😂😂😂 Eddie stop hiding your boy and give him some real fight from America
Isn't boxing so awesome?
Legendarrry behaviour!
What a slug fest
Honestly, can't recall seeing a fight like this! What a fight! Respect you both 👏👏👏👏
Connor lols so small compared to eubank jr, bros a lion fr
Age is just number for Jr.  I love his emotional intelligence tho!
One for the ages…. Fight of the Decade! This is War! Two warriors; one ring; do or die 💀
how did they not show that eubank uppercut
This fight literally had me in tears. Fighting for their legacy infront of their fathers.
3mins 😂😂😂 This was atleast 30mins of highlights did they actually see the fight!! 🔥   I’ll give benn this with out peds he still looks the same! But Ryan Garcia that 🇲🇽 cheat! Was a whole different person!   Still what a amazing fight
Great fight
Better than last canelos fight
Fight of the year both done well to entertain the crowd well done lads😊
Great fight both showed heart.
A simply stupendous fight.
Now that's a proper boxing
There is no defense in this figth?
Estuvo más buena la pelea de canelón vs el cubano correlon 😅😅
Poor. Get licensed
Incredible boxing, wow!
Best fight of the year. The runners and the snipers, like Haney and Shakur, are ruining boxing. These two Brits came to fight. Fans loved it.
naw this was one of dem fights
Benn went up 2 weight classes to make this happen 💯 both warriors
Incredible action
Fight of the year
This fight was so great from start to finish. I will put this fight in my 10 best ever in the history of boxing!!! I enjoyed this match so much I want to purchase tickets POST this very fight to show both  fighers that they gave the fight fans more than enough!!!!!
This whole situation could be a plot for a Rocky movie plot line, press conference everything
That thumbnail 👌 😂🎉
Bank doesn't have enough dawg
Unbelievable I never think Conor Benn would win Dammm
Benn won tho
thought this was a night fight in Central time but it was like 4pm and i missed it live :(
WHAT A JOKE THIS IS TRULY NOBODY IS THINKING THAT A THEN SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT GOT A DECISION ON A WELTERWEIGHT BE HONEST IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MISMATCH FROM THE GET GO
Anyone unsatisfied with this bout, you need help.
Thats a real fight
So much CTE that will feed generations 🔥🔥🔥
Wow
And now that's how you go out it too Champions Proper proper fight
Great fight
Man this fight made the canelo look boring
WOW superb modern boxing war
fight of the year candidate
now this is real boxing, none of this dance around the ring bs with scull
Mane these boys came to scrap and that’s what they did. This was the best boxing match I’ve seen in years
1:45 them boys going crazy😂
Thumbnail is crazy work
This was a robbery
A truly stupendous pugilist
Benn won
Best fight🎉
Much better thwn anything recent the americans put on
This was better than canelo and rolly fight
connor is the real winner.
This is what fighting is supposed to look like
After watching Devin Haney performance & Ryan Garcia … I had to come back and watch the highlights of a real fight
Eubank vs Benn fight had more ACTION than Ryan/Rolly,Haney/Ramirez,Teo/Barboza/,Canelo/Scull Fights..
This fight could have gone either way, but Benn was trying to unload on every punch rather than being a little more tactical. Another fight may look different, certainly would like to see a rematch. Eubank certainly won this one.
Hella quality of a fight
BENN IS LIKE MONGOOSE AND A WHIRLWIND WHILE EUBANKS LIKE A ROY JONES VIBES THIS BOUT IS PERFECT.
was he robbed?
So much better than fights of arguably bigger names like ryan garcia and canelo alvarez. Hope the Inoue fight tomorrow would be as interesting as this
Benn won ...
Now this is what boxing!
This looked like a fight from at least 20 years ago
The present father effect
Great fight but I felt benn was robbed
This was an absolute bangerr one of the besttt fights in historyyyy pureeee chaos pure talent and pure power and pure dedication to just fight and not care bout losing
EUBANK      2      -      0     BENN
Hats off to both warriors but jesus this fight was hard to watch. I was praying it wouldn't end in life debilitating injury.
This is how the average fight was like in the 80’s
History repeats 🔥🔥
Bra I can’t believe what I just seen and I can’t believe I miss this. Haven’t seen boxing like this in a min.
This is boxing not that Garcia vs rolly nonsense
1990
conor benn(illegal steroider)  vs chris eubank jr (natural)
High-class boxing!
Should of been a draw
This fight was better than the entire New York card that was billed as the boxing event of the year😂 What pro boxing is supposed to look like.
And the Americans get Garcia v Romero and Haney v Ramirez 😂😂😂
BEST FIGHT 2025🎉 idc what comes next
If they don't want to touch gloves, they shouldn't have to
this is a great fight not like davin haney always running
Best fight in last 10 years
crazy how little the ref backs them off a break before letting them go.  Definitely effects the fight, crazy town
Now compare this to the Haney fight he just had
Came back here to watch the fight again after I wasted my money on the Devin,Ryan fight!!!!°
Definitely needs a part 2
Came back to watch this after seeing Fatal fury highlights
The Eubanks family owned the Benns back in slavery days. j/k. That was a real war though. Salute to both men.
Both should be proud of themselves
The fights aways seem better when the gentlemen involved legitimately dislike one another.
I'll  wait, 3 mins ffs
people need to start respecting Cornor Ben...great fighter
Nahhhh that’s rigged the guy that won payed up for sure
Reminds me of Thunder vs Irish Mickey Ward
This boxing is  come back
Commentary so bias
Wow, Wow, Wow. This was one bloody slugfest show amongst the best of all time. Both of these fighters deserve an applause of a kind. Not so many fights are charged like that. I for one would even rank them both higher than the seniors. Job well done and justice served enough to glue people on their screens for boxing. This was a fight.
Canelo wants this eubank  dude ????   Another easy payday for the mexicalli
That was a great fight!
Rematch rematch
Eubank looks alot bigger than benn
They both look like Chris Eubank Sr
From the highlights looked like all conor
Did they end up touching gloves?
🤔...(now how am I gonna go about asking jr to pay my parking tickets)  😂
Conor won that one bro straight up
Adam smith and all those other melt commentators/pundits at DAZN should be ashamed of themselves for their biased and one-eyed commentary/commente🙈🙈call yourself professionals??? You’re a disgrace🤡🤡
Wow. Boxing is back
Was a brilliant fight one of best for a long time
Amazing fight
Happiest day of 2025 yet ❤❤
Conor Benn has a chin man sheesh. Eubanks was so much bigger and he just ate those punches.
What a fight
Just one of those heavy shots would've put me to sleep for a week. These guys walked them all off like it was nothing. What an amazing display of mental and physical fortitude. One of the best fights of modern era boxing 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Both exceptional athletes
To be fair, that was no circus, but one of the better fights recently, proper brawl
What a fight
they robbed that boy.....
One of the most amazing fights I watched this year.
Gayweather has left the comment section....
Eubank is the Greatest 🏆🏆🏆
Rematch
I don't agree with the decision at all. It wasn't that one sided. It should've been a split decision if anything.
Saya sangat menyukai ini
The highlights didn't look like a unanimous decision for Chris. I will have to watch the whole fight because the highlights says Conner for the dub
Canelo beats schull , then Crawford in September if eubank gets an international win  maybe next year in May bank vs Alvarez
Im sorry but this is sloppy boxing, yes its fierce but their barely any defensive. Its slack offense, guard down way to much that results in easy shots. Even the style ij tje ring to me is sloppybin comparison to if they are training in the gym, those gym tactics go out the window and welcome street fighting.
Benn was going for the knockout, thats why he went so hard and always going for the head. Didnt play with Eubank junior a bit to bait him then go for the killer punch. Hence why Benn tired a bit quicker too but still, what a fight. Benn is explosive and Eubank doesnt have his fathers precision and movement though.
Benn is a brawler. This reminds me of the last Creed movie
Defo a weight advantage for Eubank surely?
One of the best fights ive seen in years. Both did excellent
This is a FIGHT ..
Ladies and Gentlemen: The lost art of Boxing.
When it's a draw they don't call a draw.
wow, very dangerous
Boxing is horrible at advertising fights
From the Dads rivalry and fights all those years ago to their actual sons doing the same thing many years later, the whole drama of the first fight, the build up in the second to them having an absolutely unbelievable fight - it's a real life Rocky movie and we all witnessed such a unique amazing moment and history ❤ Eubank Benn 🥊
I Don't Think Connor Benn Lost .. maybe the last round but he definitely controlled the fight
🔥
Best fight in 2025 so far
Obvious weight mismatch. Eubanks looked way bigger(more like a MW) in that ring. Meanwhile Speed at 2:33😂
Best foght so far of2025 easy
I watched their fathers fight a long time ago. What a pleasure to see their sons put on a great show years later. 🥊
This was a great boxing bout!
This was a great fight and amazing skill and outstanding conditioning.
Quality
Haney still has his "0" 🤣
wicked fight,, this here is what will inspire young men to want t o be a boxer,,, brilliant
Benn won
Penn won
Benn Lumped Him up For a Smaller guy
What’s funny is, this is movie worthy. Two warriors clash decades later their sons also clash, while victory stays on one side.
Some of them vicious hooks and winging shots from Benn in the 10 and 11th would have turned Eubank's lights out if they connected. So much anger and power in every swing. He's tough aswell. Eubank caught him with some big head shaking shots in the 12th and i don't know how he stayed on his feet.
What’s the people opinion on this fight? Eubanks or Benn?
This is 🔥
In Mourinho accent: “Boxing Heritage.”
This was the most grizzliest fight I've ever seen just a real fight to see can't get any realer than this.
Benn in all black like m tyson.😂
What a fight… both are warriors
Eubank outstriked him but conor benn had bigger moments
Little Benn is the definition of it's not the size of the dog in the fight.
Both of their fathers have so much to be proud of what a feeling that must be and as well for the boys they waited their entire lives to have a moment like that in front of their first hero that being their fathers. What a fight that's what boxing needs more of!! That was a fight that was supposed to as advertised and it was!
Where's eubanks highlights he can't of got a win if this is all
I don’t know how they match up in weight one is clearly smaller than the other, just like their seniors how funny is that eh
Ebunk lost he was the the scared person
Great fight
Nothing better in sports than a boxing match like this imo. Like, my hometown teams can win championships, and thats really awesome and a ton of fun, but it does not touch a fight like this.
I just watch the highlights how did uback win
EUBANK VS BENN
What a fight! Props to both warriors
I wanna errol Spence jr fight Connor benn👀💪🏽
Eubanks Jr. reminds me of Muhammad Ali
Show this fight to the pillow fists lightweight division  Haney shakur This is how you sell a fight  FIGHT
Benn punches mostly landed on air..😂😂😂he need to be accurate in punch I saw many swing didn't land😂
Unanimous what the fck
Now that’s was a fight 💯
The commentary on DAZN was a disgrace. Totally Biased to Conor Benn. They don't even try to hide it.
What a wild pace, especially in the later rounds.
Conor benn won in these highlights….
Now.  This is boxing  Well deserved PPV
Respect to Benn A worrior  Even after the loss❤
What a battle!!!!And to think  the biggest most publiced fight this year was the absolute dire , insult to boxing  Tyson vs  J paul. A fight which  showed how money can ruin sport .
For me Connor Benn should’ve won with him leaving Chris Eubank Jr. with a broken jaw and yes i know factors in winning boxing is not only about that 🤙
Ben got robbed
One of the best fights ever
Not a fan of boxing but thatnlook like one of the best fight to watch ever.
this fight like hellfire 🔥🔥🔥
this could have been a draw
Epic fight.  Both fighters showed huge heart but Chris Eubank Jr….what a warrior the weight drain was disgusting!!!
Benn is ferocious even in a loss great fight body won't survive many fights like that brutal
Some fight though, absolute beaat of a match up n promotion
Eubank looks SOOO much bigger than Benn they dont even look in the same weight class
It was savagery... love the english language
I love how thr referee was like "nooo haaaa TOUCH GLOVES!!..... That was mad to see lol it's about respect... Even if you don't respect each other... Respect what your about to engage in at least???
I'm looking forward to the the next generation (the grand kids) that fight will be epic too..........The one after that will be AI Humanoid and probably fixed lol
Fight of the year.
These highlights were completely in favour of Benn. Eubank landed more clean hits which is ultimately why he just edged it in the end. Yet these highlights only show 2 average hits from eubank.
Both are goats
Got to give it to connor he went toe to toe and proved he is a great fighter but chris he deserved the win I think he won by about 2-3 rounds. Both warriors total respect to them both.
What a fight!!!!!!!
5yrs Ago Paqiuao would beat this Boxer Benny. 🥰
Like MMA these guys delivered a great fight not worrying about loses, that’s the way we want to see fights not judges giving a fighter a nod when he doesn’t deserve it. Well done boys u put on a great fight and deserve more $$$ than the promoters ga e u. There thieves.
Just a shame they didnt embrace after that war! They both done more than enough to earn eachothers respect. 2 warriors thankyou for giving us a thrilling night of boxing!!
Rematch
Size difference is crazy
Eubanks struggled
Conor Ben clearly won that boxing fight 💪🤜
That's boxing as it should be.
I'm so happy Eubanks won ❤❤
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!

Eubank is my guy. He gets hate he doesn't not deserve. His drive and ambition speak for themselves, and he fights at a smart cadence: max money, minimal brain damage. IDK if Benn cheated before but IMHO he's earned bags of respect back for this Hurculean effort. Taking pre-fight banter with a pinch of salt, he speaks well on family and life. (Side note, commentators using the word savagery never sits well with me, irrespective of what the word means in a vacuum, too much dialogue with history). All this despite a promoter who shows a casual disregard for fighters' wellbeings. TLDR: Against all odds, scintillating fight.🥊
REF - Touch gloves touch Gloves... *ref stepps on lego* ah ah ahhh
making them touch gloves before the fight is bs, its the refs job to enforce the rules not play peacemaker

Benn could’ve gotten him out of there in the 10th but his punches got a bit wild..If he had tightened them up he would’ve knocked chris out.. He just barely missed a few of those..

I don't see how Eubank won this bout! Ben was throwing haymakers!
They should show the real high. Lights and stop making this fight look like it was a draw
Chris Eubank Jr had it all the way. Connor will probably be back on the gear tomorrow. 😂
Dude missed weight by a lot.  definitely much bigger than Benn but heck of a fight from both sides.

Bro benn was winning the first few rounds but Eubank hits so hard he makes you go backwards Eubank has underrated power that kills you after
The best fight I have EVER watched in my 40 years of life.  I wish this fight happened before the 1st postponed fight as they both would've been a few years younger but that's not to take anything away from Jr. They both put it all out in there. I would pay to watch a second fight.

Don’t see this much in boxing today both men just squaring up and trying to rock each others boat. Too many fighters scared to take a loss so they either fight cautiously or duck the fight for years with excuses. Glad to have seen these two final get it on and what a fight it was to watch.

Jheeze, Connor’s an animal! Fair play to Jr of course, but I had Benn down as all mouth and no balls. Titans!

The best boxing match I've ever seen (in my lifetime). Completely lived up to it's build up. Complete drama, what a storyline. Respect to both fighters, but Eubank Jr is just that bit more classy.

2 legends
These highlights are so bias ffs
This fight was a reminder why I love boxing so much. Benn was loading up way too much and it was clear he didn't have the power to hurt Eubank with a single shot. It would have helped Benn a lot had he thrown more volume punches and taken a bit off.
Chris Jr really impressed me considering all the odds he had to overcome at 35 years old!

If Benn works on his composure and stays in his weight class he will be a world champion it is rare to be able to be as explosive as he is and still go 12 hard rounds. The decision could have been a draw but it was a great fight for both men

Was this just a posh Youtuber fight? I thought boxing was about  controlled aggression. Conor Benn seemed too wound up and at times did not look like a professional boxer. A lot of his attempts were just wild swings. Yes it was entertaining but the quality was not great. Also did Conor Benn dumb down Eubank Jr, did Eubank Jr underestimate Conor Benn or were there health complications related to Eubank Jr having to make weight?
Both wouldn’t last in the ring against top contenders in America js
Wow. This fight a masssssive build up to live up to. And it frikin did, they pulled it off. Absolutely amazing!! No losers in this fight

Can we take a moment and appreciate what Chris Jnr did. He put all the pressure on himself. He said he would retire if he lost. He agreed to a gruelling weight cut. He was prepared to fight without his dad.  He had the pressure of paying crazy fines. Hes also 35 and his best years are behind him. With that being said. He outworked the younger guy. He exposed the sloppy punches of conor and took away that invincible aura from him. He was humble in victory and did not rub his victory in Conors face.  I guarantee if Conor won, he would have rubbed it in juniors face.

Yeah it was a brilliant boxing match but bottom line is eubank jr is too big and heavy for the fight to really be fair. I know he dropped weight to make the fight but you can see him knocking Benn around like a ragdoll when his hits connect. i feel like the prestige of their heritage is what really allowed this fight to happen. Very entertaining though
Banks looked 20 lbs heavier than Benn, great fight nonetheless 👍👍👍

Excellent fight, but if Benn hadn't been so WILD, he would have done much better. At times he was flailing with his punches, and hitting nothing but empty air, while Eubank was much calmer and a lot more accurate. Benn needs to calm down, and stop wasting so much energy with his frenetic movement.

Eubank is wonderfull in his defence and slipping tactics.i saw many of Benn's punches went away of his target.these shoulder rolls were pure majesty.

He bullied him the whole fight lol
Eubank won because he was bigger, he smothered benn
Benn Connor threw his punches with evil intent😂😂😂, missing most of the time... Eubank was cool, calm and collected throwing and landing spot-on shots

Quality fight
This is an amazing showing of how exciting British boxing is. I get annoyed with the British fans but your boxers are truly something to be proud of.
Insane fight. First fight in ages that's lived up to the hype.
Little guy is pretty strong for his size
This has only showed me the little guy can have power.
I was at Tottenham last night, I want sympathy for this hangover.
I would have said Benn took it from what I’ve seen, seemed to land more big shots and Eubank looks much worse after the fight than Benn
Eubank was way bigger than Benn
WHAT.... it actually happened?
Fight of the year for sure, 2 men quite literally putting their lives on the line. I prefer safer technical boxing rather than a Chisora style slug fest, which is too dangerous and therefore don’t want to see the rematch
What an awesome fight.... credit to both Benn and Eubank Jr, you both delivered and lived up to the hype, fantastic. I wanted Eubank to win, but boy, Benn came ready to rumble, and both gave their all. This is how boxing use to be back in the day when ITV  had the big fight live. Well done fellas.
I can t stop smiling watching this
Both of these guys missed so many opportunities to end that fight. Neither of them knew how to side step under a punch to get the angle they needed, Especially conor. His corner should've been able to point that out & instruct him to do it. It was a great action fight, but their lack of defensive footwork in close was tragic to see neither of them do.

Better than those boring Tank, Teofemale, Haney, Rolly, Spence, Shakur, Canelo, Charlo, Tszyu, Fundora, Barbosa, Catterall, Taylor, Zurdo and other fights.  There are too many to mention, but they could learn from this.  They're selling smoke, while these two are selling real goods.

What a match !!!!!
It was a draw at best
This didnt justblive up the hype, it blew it away.  I gave eubank the first round, conor took multiple after that, after round 9 i had eubank up by 1, but then he absoluteley battered benn in the last 3.  This was a fight that could have ended any second of any round. Conor benn was dangerous the whole duration and how eubank got through the first 5 i still dont know.

Maybe not unanimous decision but definitely split
Amazing war. Both were determined. Eubank is too big for Benn.
Eubank looks like light heavyweight
BENAVIDEZ 🔥💯💪🏼🏆🏆

More like a slug-fest than the sweet science, but still very entertaining!
This was a mismatch. A tiny guy against someone twice his size. Conor should not have taken this fight. But pride took over i guess.   He did well against eubank, but it was never gonna be his win. Look at the size difference.  I had it closer than what the judges scored. I had it at 114 -116 for eubank. It would have been a draw, but eubank won it in the last two rounds

Best show from DAzN. DAzN is wack always sorry as fighters but this1 was a robbery
8-4 was criminal. has a  Ben Shalom fighter ever lost a decision? that was a draw or 7-5 at most
Почему они не хотят быть чемпионами??? Почему они не называют имя Жанибека ??? 🤔
LOVED this fight! Eubank stood focused and poised but Connor reminded me of a wolverine, not afraid, not backing down and relentless, always dangerous. I like that Eubank Sr. gave Connor props at the end face to face. At the end of the day, this is a sport no need for all of the hatred.
Benn missed so many haymakers.

Credit to Conor Ben. We know he's got a decent chin now
I ve had this on repeat all day
I think Conner done exactly what Ricky Hatton done years ago.He went in to eager to angry all he done was throw that right hand from outside somewhere he didn't think. It's ok doing all that speed work in the gym fast bobbing and weaving but its never taken into the ring shame really because if it was he be untouchable. He needed patience and to pick his targets better he landed some but only on eubanks mistakes. Hardly and upper cuts no doubling up on shots.He was moving around that fast and unrelaxed it through him off balance and ruined his timing he was absolutely out of gas by round  nine that's what lost him the fight. Eubank new this and attacked him. This is why eubank had energy left he wasn't doing the hundred mtr sprint he plans for a marathon and paced himself. Connors corner should of have him a plan B and said relax your body is doing 100 mph but your throwing 3 punches what's the point at least 2 have missed the target. Oh well guess it's done 😊
Great fight but unanimous decision
Awesome a fully fuelled Chris would’ve stopped Conor not taking anything away from him he was amazing against the bigger guy. Conor can definitely make big waves at 147.

No losers here, we all won big. Us fans and both of these great fighters. You don't see fights like this often. I know the king must be more than pleased his son provailed. The worry Sr. had for his son was heartbreaking. So to see Jr. win must've been...in his own words "sensational". Big respect for both of these men, and there fathers. Who just gave us another iconic fight and rivalry decades after they've both hung up their gloves. This was amazing

Robbed
This was a bar fight, absolutely terrible technique and 💯 obvious it was not a championship level fight. Otherwise it was a great low level entertainment brawl. Respect to both Conor and Chris for showing their warrior spirit. However, either man could have easily outclassed the other with just a little bit more technicality and defensive responsibility.  Conor said "I'm not sure exactly what went wrong, maybe 14 months out of the ring played a role or maybe the 160pounds, I dunno". What really went wrong is not being skillful enough, Conor needs to level up. He gets away with terrible footwork, terrible defense, terrible everything at 147 because he's just so powerful but again not even close to Championship level. He needs more skills if he wants to be a legit World Champion.

Great fight with all the drama!. From the UK, and while I respect both fighters' courage, our national boxing methodology is holding us back. We need more focus on fundamentals, like Marcos Camejo's Cuban Boxing Academy in West London approach, to reach world-class standards.
They brought back the old gold memories ❤
🔥🔥🔥 Eubank fought for his life!
I ve had this on repeat all day
Pure talent. No words
For the people who call and boo benn he’s just gone right up in my estimation as has eubank
Finally a fight the matched the expectations, i honestly thought they were just talking out there ahh and were just going to walk around and tap like everyone does
My money was on benn the man is a machine but i was wrong by points i hope they fight again what a beautiful story and history behind this fight
You just earned a new subscriber
almost like a dragon ball fight.. INSANE SPEED
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Great Fight!!!! Somebody fighting in the wrong weight class.
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
What a fight, old school boxing
What a fight
Honestly what a fight
Crazy fight
TOUCH EM NOW AHH AHAHHH
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Nowhere in the world does it like Great Britain 🇬🇧 when it comes to authentic grudge boxing matches. This was exceptional.
If eubank had a tad more power he'd be an unparalleled beast
Shocking highlights
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
No winner 🥇 for me they are the best to watch...rematch will be inavitable cool to all guys
Pure talent. No words
What a fight!
Охуенный бой
Picked up where the dads left off. Unbelievable night.
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
I ve had this on repeat all day
Fight of the year 100%
Think the weight advantage was clear to see, Benn hit him with some bombs and Eubank just walked through them over and over again, amazing fight, I think it was the correct decision in the end to give Eubank the win but incredible performance from both of them
One of the best fights i’ve seen, hats off to both 💪
Straight out of a Rocky/ Apollo creed movie 🥹🥹
Epic heart shown by both lads. Well done.
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Makes a difference when both fighters really want to beat the other, doesnt it!
Watching it live it was a draw, watching these highlights made it seem like YouTube was on x5 speed 🤣 highlights favour eubank
This is boxing
Best fight ive seen in years.
Kahit mag rematck Eubank parin mananalo.
Tha pane he felt loosing at 3:02 hunts me
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Ben got so emotional 😂😂😂
run this thing back give them 3ple the money
This gave me chills… in the best way
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
That was a punch down 💪👊🤛
Ggg was the king of middle weight
benn won
Eubank's father turning up was just part of the script.
Ben
all fights need to be this level what a fight
Hats off to both of  these warriors, they did their father's proud.
Conor won I think and he was much smaller speaks alot
Best fight of the decade !!
Domestic level fight, both are going nowhere near world title challenge.
Benn won that all day
They fought hard....  It was a fight for their own freedom against the name...   To be theirnown man their own auccess and not be just known as the sons of their fathers
Ben came into boos and left with the crowed loving him
Eubank smashed him
I really would’ve been comfortable with a draw. They both fought their hearts out. I do think Eubanks landed the cleaner punches. But this was so close and such a great fight. One of the best fights I’ve seen in years.
This is what you get when fighter fight for pride and family name. These days they fight for guaranteed $$ and hype which allows them run around all night like a sparring match. True fighting spirit showed by both
En tus dos estilos eres hermosa♥️
Not gonna lie, I feel like Connor had that.
Referee an absolute disgrace
Legendary
Warriors
This was insane fight.
Was funny listening to the pudits, everytine Benn landed a half decent punch, best thing they've ever seen. Anytime Eubank landed, Silence. No wonder people thought Benn won with commentary like that
He got robbed straight robbery. He did not win this fight.
3 mins of highlights that seemingly miss out a lot of Eubank success… we see you Dazn
ironically get 2 sub fighters with heart who cant punch and they give you a war Gatti, Ward for eg great fight no need to do it again JR is finished at super middle who can he really beat Adim Azzim would destroy him Benn has a future but only at the lighter weight great night for boxing we all love a grudge match.
Ref can't make you touch gloves
I don't think Hollywood could write a better script than what we all experienced
Ма дукх хан яр ала, боксехь ишт борж латар хилаз👍
looked like a sensational fight - happy for eubank with his father constantly throwing shade over his son
Great fight by both men 😊
Boxing needs to add more Round(s) if fight was close like Overtime in Basketball.
Both lucky Collins kids aren’t fighting 😂
You can tell Benn is a DAZN fighter
from the highlights, the decision is a little surprising.
That fight was elastic, but the 3 minute of highlights is a insult to both fighter
Turki needs to drop the full fight ASAP as he has done before
Not a massive amount of skill on show from either guy, but they made it up with pure heart, and pure aggression in a 12 round trade off.
🫡👏👏
Man that stare down was parliamentary
The right man won the fight I was glad to witness this epic war!
Was it even for a belt or just a grudge fight.
Eggie Hearn style highlights from Dazn trying to show Benn got robbed when in reality Eubank dominated this fight.
Brutal
What a war 😮
Size difference was huge, Benn looks like Eubank's little brother.
Hope they also have sons so this rivalry goes one forever 😅
Robbed
If connor benn was the same size as jnr he would probably have won with a knockout, but respect to  both, they put my faith back into boxing...the whole fight was a nostalgia inducing reminder of fathers fight in 90s, rematch clause, will it be used?
The ref the real MVP for letting them fight not getting too involved
Robbed
MORALES VS BARRERA TYPE
Ik this going sound crazy but after watching this I don’t think anyone truly in 160 can mess w Benn
The commentators were such Ben fanboys. It was sickening to witness. The Eubank dynasty lives on!
What a great war from both warriors!
The LH weight has just had sigh of relief as Connor got beat. 😊
What a fight, this is not boxing but war!👏👏👏❤️
More like Fury vs Wilder 3
Loved it! No BS tactics or holding back. This was just a proper brawl between two men who entered that ring going "I either leave this stadium as a champion or in an ambulance" 👏👏
Nowhere near as skilled as their fathers though. Had to be a slugfest to satiate the appetite of the fickle mob.
Superb fight 👏
love how they both wore the same kit as their dads back in 1990
Classic
Great,great fight. Recover properly and give us the rematch 🥊
Moment of silence for the people like me that didn't get a chance to see this fkn fight 😡 ot at work.
3 minute video is actually a disgrace after what we saw last night
This fight was like putting cheat codes on a xbox game but still can't complete the level.
This intensity was beyond. How did they not run out of stamina ?
Conor win the figth
Hehe 😂 whats up conor benn.. you record is not enough bcoz’ all opponent your fight is not stronger boxer.. except christ eubank jr, is strong boxer!! Hehe😂😂
The PRIDE of both the fighters Legendary Name gave us a great fight. What a fight, both so strong.
This was like one of the old fashioned boxing fights. Loved it. Could really see those 2 trying to carry their father's legacies
True warriors, both winers
They bought he best out of each other.
Chris killed him in the 12th go on Chris get him back for the drug test ❤❤❤
Great fight and it had it been given to Benn I could see that too but neither of them won the fight by 4 rounds, shocking scoring by the judges
Whoever put this video together, needs to be fired
2025
Didn't think that was unanimous
I gotta be honest I thought Eubanks would dominate hats off to benn what a fight I personally scored it a draw but would love a rematch 👍
Rigged highlights
I must have been watching a different fight there's wasn't much boxing on display at all it was just a brawl from start to finish. Not an instant classic just over hyped
definetly going to be a rematch!
Great fight... fair play to both lads.
I didn’t watch the full fight, but from this highlight Conor won, and I ain’t even a fan of him maybe I should find a link for the full fight
What a fight two great boxers well done to both of them
🔥
What a fight
I was impressed with this fight 👏🏿
Unbelievable fight fantastic,action packed I still say tho If this was eubank 3 4 years prior Connor would be done 🎉amazing fight still
Fight of the year !
This fight made up for the boring undercard. Fight of the year so far. Really hope we can see the rematch but not sure hiw possible that will be for both.
This fight was stupendous
Love the way Nigel got involved asking Chris snr to attend the fight and the way Conor spoke after the fight. The attitude of both families is a great advert for boxing. Both families are winners for me
I feel the hydration clause made Eubank not be at his best, conner is a savage tho. Well done to both men, what an amazing battle.  Eubank should retire, Conner need to chase the belts in his weight division.
Wish I watched it now thought it was gonna be a a flop like most modern matches now days
Wow. Two absolute warriors
Wow! These are 2 warriors fighting in the ring... anyone could have won the match.💥🔥 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Historic Event. What pemrifessionals.
As a boxing fan ,  this is what i want   ,exciting fights,  even if my fav fighters loose.great show!
Eubank won the fight on the last two rounds, in the last two rounds he had NO tactic, NO ENERGY just stand toe to toe and brawl
What a beautiful fight wow
Boxing Lesson from Eubank so Benn has no power in Middleweight and i see no chance of winning to Ennis
Even the biased commentators couldn't win Benn the fight.
Conor hen, sent home to roost
This is not the ferocious eubank of 6 years ago ...maybe the weight cutt or age ...
An absolute dogfight, respect to both warriors - both displayed insane heart.  I predicted Eubank to stop Conor late, but Conor wore the MW frame well & had far better endurance than I thought he'd have.  Hoping for a rematch, but it would be nice to see Conor push for a world title afterwards - he's proven he can hang with elite competition
Both terrible
Robbery 😢
3mins huh
Bad blood in Play, both fighters went for each others head. Ladies and Gentlemen that’s what boxing used to be
We were all in a time machine last night and travelled back to the 90's !!!   No more youtuber fights please .. hopefully this will remind everyone what boxing really is
Fight of the century, great heart from Eubank
Boxing is clearly back! Massive respect for these proper boxers!👍👏👏
Absolutely stupendous!
British boxing when it’s best. Instant classic, so much history.
Why was snr there? I thought he said it was a disgrace. That they havent spoken for years? So it was all pony....
Best fight I've been in a long time.
Quite like to see benn win the next. Then in 25 years we can have the grandkids fight 😂
Thats not a fair decision suppose to be a draw fight
Ref was annoying af
Re Match In my opinion. It was super close
Unquestionably an instant classic
I stood up and applauded at the end of the fight
Bro how is the highlight only 3 minutes? This fight was fking crazy
low level zero power fighters
12 rounds both dad's will be proud of that match and obviously they'll be at it again at some point 👍
3 minutes of highlights for a fight like that.
Easily a draw great fight
Imagine fully hydrated eubank.
Pretty boring tbh
Benn looks like a whole weight class lower than Eubank
Dazn is showing a biased highlighs
What a fight that was
I scored it a draw. Rematch is needed. Wembley stadium. Late July.
Amazing fight. Eubank showed tremendous heart. Benn, too. And all action til the end
This is real boxing! These two are proper
The inside boxing between these two was insane. Stellar performance by both men. What a story that was told in the ring. They left it all in there blood sweat and tears.
both men gave 100% and showed that warrior determination to not give up. amazing fight cant wait for the rematch
Quality fight. Both did themselves proud
He deserved that win. Well done Eubank Jr. ❤
The epitome of inherited beef but what a fight mann!!!
Fight of the year? Is this how boxing has fallen? Neither are world class, neither are the champion of anything. I'd rather watch 2 matids eating eash other.
If they fight again they both need to work the body.
Came here to check out the clown show, left absolutely blown away. Both dudes were swinging for the fences with mega power behind their shots. What a fight.
Respect to both these fighters ✊🏽
Rematch waitng soon money money  😂😂😂
Superb boxing match, both fighters fought like champions.
It was an entertaining but pointless fight. Middleweight champion of the garbage dump!
A proper scrap , well done lads . Be proud
Looks brutal 😮😮
Everything we hoped for and more theese 2 delivered 🙏
Why I don’t watched that live 🫠
Eubanks looks a weight class bigger than Benn
History repeats 🙌🏻 what a fight
Great fight  !  Ben to small  Eubanks needs to go up  weight looked boiled down.  Weight classes for a reason
Reminded me of some of the all time great fights. What a performance from both men! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
robbery!!!
So glad eubank won.  If a rematch hope eubank takes it only if they let him fight at a more fair weight
38 fights and still no major title.
Finally a decent fight. Respect to both fighters. Conor humble in his loss and Chris humble with his win.
Was there live. Never seen anything like it. What a night
Great fight of two mediocre fighters
What a seriously incredible boxing match and fight that was. That is what you call a world class boxing match 🔥
This was epic
I like this to fighter...not like Shakur...always running..
Respect 2 both fighters, true fight full of energy !
Fight on the year for sure
Eubank shud not have joined heads with Ben and slog it out. He had reach and weight. Shud have used his jab and picked his punches like early rounds. No common sense. Pathetic fight. No skill.
Great fight roll on the rematch
Chris win this easy. You judge a fight round by round. And jr won 8-4. Easy.
nah for me the winner is Benn
world class fight from two fighters who aren't world class - best way I can describe the fight!
Classic. Bring on the rematch.
One of the best boxing matches I have ever seen. It actually lived up to the hype, drama, prestige and legacy. Thanks to all involved
Rather benn won but can't argue with the fight. Lived up to everything and more. Let's have a rematch
Shoulda been draw. Benn first 4 rounds and round 8&9
One greatest dog fights ever seen
Highlight is dead man so much combos they coulda showed
What a battle
They may not be world champions but after that fight they are champions of the world and British! Absolutely British! No one fights like us in the ring no one. From start to finish all heart guts bravery courage and skill. Don't let anyone ever tell you this country is finished when we produce 2 fighters  of that creed 30 years on from their fathers. Take a bow young eubank and benn you have shown us all what being British is all about. Thank you from an old amateur fighter who is 64 now. Respect to you both eternally.
the ref was so annoying it could of easily been a bad fight but it werent
Forget  Logan Paul, this is a proper fight
They were both drained at the end
Feels like this was made to be a Conor benn highlight lol
Best amateurs I’ve seen 😂
Going off of the highlights shown, that didn’t look unanimous. 🤔🤔🤔
Unanimous??? I didn’t see the fight but from what I heard on the radio it didn’t sound unanimous
I don't understand when both fighters want to knock the other spark out and then it goes the distance the "winner" flopping to the floor like it was their life's goal seems a bit backwards.  In that situation I get emotions are a part of it but I'd just put my glove up and walk off because the goal was to knock them out and not win on points right?
Felt like a was watching old school boxing. Absolutely Incredible🔥🔥
GREAT FIGHT.. thank you
Just shows what boxing has been missing these are the real fights everyone wanted to see for years.  But promoters and TV platforms refusing to work with each other for years spoilt boxing until the Saudis got involved. Money talks
Full on brawl.  Loved it ❤️
This fight was a throwback to the 80s and 90s. Loved it
Is this the fight a of the year ?  Thank messieurs for that great show.
Cmon now Dazn, this classic fight needs longer highlights.  This was one for the ages.
Bro that first 15 seconds had me preaching “Oh no!” from the stare down alone 😂💀
You don't play boxing. 🖤
This is Benn fighting clean???? I need to look up his highlights when he got popped bc that man looked like an android on a mission
One of those unusual fights where both fighters gained even when one lost. Hopefully Benn learned his lesson and stays clean - I'd like to see him go back down weights and start mounting a world title challenge. Unsure where Eubank goes from here but hats off for his performance.
FIGHT OF THE YEAR!!! I haven't been this satisfied from both fighters in a VERY... VERY long time.
Taught useless fury a proper fight
Two great fighters❤
Two men knocking 10 bells out of each other from the start to the finish . Great night Eddie do the right thing with Benn
TOUCH THEM AAAAHHHHHHHH
And people thought YouTube boxing was better
Even in the highlights connor wins . So how did he lose. Rigged
Both just brawl out in the ring.
Haha, funny how they Smash there brains
Eubank was was like 1/4 bigger size than Benn. At least 12 pounds bigger...
Perché non va più di moda scrivere la categoria di peso?
This was NON STOP. Never I don't think have I seen a fight where the WHOLE fight it was just BOMBS AFTER BOMBS, thanks gentlemen. What a scrap.
Props to Benn for moving up to 160 for this fight 🫡
I love this fight 😅❤
That rehydration clause was dangerous, but so was the crazy size difference. Great foght for both. If it wasnt so dangerous for both id say do it again but, ots not worth the risk for both.
Absolutely a great fight, only downside is the judges didn’t see it for what it was. And made one boxer lose by far greater than he should have in my eyes . Well done to both, you should feel proud of yourselfs
after watching this for the 10th time.................i will still watch this than a ringside with the latest live fight of mayweather
Meanwhile Canyellow ducking REAL fighters and fighting unheard of tin cans in Saudi
Been watching boxing for 20+ years. I've not seen a better fight then this and won't for a very long time. They both left everything in that ring.  What a fight...
How can you confidently post such a biased highlight video 😂
Brilliant combo 0:50
All the two faced morons in the comments hahaha
British boxing has very much declined over the last ten years sad really
..ah lov' dem bof like ah lov' deir far'v'rsz. RiP Sebaztiun. London.
Amazing fight!! Non stop. Thought is was a draw, cant complain either way. If theres a rematch il be there.
Saw the whole fight. Fair play to Eubank. Natural weight told in the end, but both were absolute warriors.
even if he loss,,from now on👌👌im a fan of conor benn👌👌👌
a propa fkn fight that was. benn has the moral victory....he comes out of this looking  bright and shiny. need to make his next high profile fight soon. turhki almost jumped in the ring at one point lol so hes all in too. well done eddie you kept pushing and pushing never gave up on this fight. well done all round
Typical Eddie hearn highlights,  your boy got smashed
Yeeeessssss what a fight🔥🔥🔥..Fair play to both.. But let’s be real Eubank tries to fight Canelo he will get SMASHED plain and simple. Let’s not get on the hype train.  That’s why GGG didn’t take Eubank seriously.. If Eubanks fights Canelo, Jr doesn’t make it til end of fight
Great fight 👏 👌 👍
Dejavu!
Belter of a fight
Eubank was lucky to be the physically bigger man, as well as being a slightly better pugilist in the true sense of the word!   But if he had been smaller, or the exact same physical size as Benn, he might not have gotten the victory!   Conor Benn should return to to his original boxing weight (147/148) and dominate there!   I see no need for a rematch!!   👊🏾🇳🇬👊🏾🇳🇬!!

Fantastic display of boxing and likely won’t be seen again for a long time👌👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏼
Eubank redesigned benn's face  Eubank is a skillful and beautiful fighter. This should be in the Lineup for fight of the year contenders  Instant classic 🔥 WAR!
Eubank had no legs entire fight
to hit and not get hit is over
I watched Benn land more points in this ….both amazing warriors amazing ….no one lost this fight
In the 12th round I was screaming at Jr to use the ring, no need to engage so much, he had already won enough rounds late on to secure a victory.... But this wasn't a boxing match, this was a blood feud. Both men have my respect but Jr is a monster.
One of the best fights I’ve seen in a very long time.
Rematch mandatory Conor Ben won
Absolutely epic fight, both went for it from minute one and kept it up for 12 rounds. Totally agree with the score, I had it the same, hats off to both guys 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Great fight man nothing else to say
I feel like a fool for not watching the full fight first! Dam!!
Eubank Jr is a warrior even after the opposition tried everything in the book to weaken him.
I think benn might of won that fight. He had eubank rocked a few times 🎉
Wow! Both of them are real man and true warrior unlike floyd mayweather a very boring fighter.
80 kg vs 70 kg
It was a war
Just imagine if the first fight 2 years ago happened!!? We would be on the trilogy by now 😢
What a fight that was. Proper old fashioned grit
Proper scrap that
I actually wish I paid to watch this 😅😅😅
instant classic... for me, twice the fight of their dads, which feels insane to say lol
Conor is really heavy-handed - i expect him to learn how to break opponents by "chopping down" the smooth muscles and pushing back opponents with solid jab, all through. I am absolutely grateful there is excellent camaradrie between both families and the boys.
what a fight
Fun fight to watch even as a non boxing watcher
The sky sports commentators were shocking… the bias in favour of Conor was so obvious to hear
They both gave it all , left it all in the ring.
Fair play to Benn, he looks to be smaller weight class put in there with someone who's path he normally wouldn't cross except for people cashing in on their fathers legacy yet he brought the fight and went toe to toe holding his own.
No losers here 👏
All timer. Unreal fight. Boxing won!
very rarely do we get wars like this anymore. They both done their fathers proud.
U can see ring rust in Eubank jr.
Thumbnail is crazy
Skills levels very low in this fight. They arent elite fighters but it was a war
The car did not crash
Legendary stuff. British legends well done gents truly lived up to the hype
Thought boxing is no more but this is the boxing that i know. Thank you❤❤❤
Rare caliber
Terrible highlights of a great fight.
Ben is to small
This was one of the closest fights I’ve seen in a while. Great fight! Two amazing warriors making their legendary fathers proud
The rolls back the years to when British boxing had that allure and excitement! Haye Chisora, OG Benn Eubank, Froch groves, what great times..
One of the best fights I’ve seen I a while🔥
Sold
Rematch is the key
seems like they gave it their all
This looks like Micky Ward vs Arturo Gatti from Walmart.😂😂
Wooowzy....... 🧢🧢
Conor can go to welterweight knock people out and shown he can take shots of a super middleweight !!  He has genuine chances to be a world champion at that weight
Nice fight 👍
What a fight, that's boxing 🥊
That's two hard working sportsmen fighting in their family legacy
golden boxing
Enseñenle esto al pecas 😅
Best fight I've seen in years. That wasn't a boxing match .....that was an all out street fighting war ! The 2 of them should be proud of themselves 👊 🤜 🤛   💪
They physically look like they belong in two different weight classes.
They threw a slugger party
Единогласным решением😢?Мой счет 3:2 ,за малым выиграл по очкам
Highlights tell a different story.  Doesn’t look unanimous to me.
In Match Room highlights, Connor Ben won, here he lost.
I hope the mothers of both boys didn't watch this. Both fathers can feel pride in their sons performance  🤜🤛
Dana White/Turki watch and learn....home of boxing...stadium...not even elite boxers...listen to the atmosphere....USA and Turki can never replicate the Brits and the home of boxing.
what a robbery !!!!!
This fight was amazing no boring rounds at all this has given both fighters some seriously insane boosts especially eubank he needed to unleash the warrior in him to now continue to show his skills and this has given benn the credit back
Amazing fight 🥹🔥🔥
Real boxing
Certainly Eubank was a lot of weight for Benn, who fought bravely nevertheless
Rematch Rematch Rematch
These highlights make it look close.. but eubank boxed his head off in the first half of the fight and beat him in his own game in the second half
Fight of the decade
What is a beauty dance...
Had to be a draw atleast
No robbery here as some people suggest. But, Benn didn’t deserve 116-112 UN after that effort
Live up for the hype!
Itz enough to you Conor  bcouse .your arrogant  ..and talkative.😅
Amazing fight ✊🏻 both did they best at the end Fans won
This why boxing beats ufc sports
Eddie you need to eat your own words you punk...
Even tho they was no knock down. This was a scrap big up both fighters👊💪
Well done Chris...
Best fight I seen in a while..them UK dudes can bang
Im so glad Eubanks won!
This is boxing  Got me shadow boxing
Best entertainment the stadium has ever seen
To say they went to war seems like a poor reflection of the sheer heart and violence they poured into each other last night. I feel proud to have watched it. What a fight.
What a fight 😮😮 For me it was draw.
Unanimous decision judges were bribed deffo Benn had him in trouble 3 times Benn was never in trouble well done Chris for the biggest robbery since the 1930s
Eubank JR definitely won that as I knew he would. Well done Chris!.
What happened to not being in his corner, SNR what a Bullocks talker in the buildup!!!
thought the fight was overhypped, clearly i was wrong, big respect for both and Benn had heart, 1:34 this shot would have dropped many !
Great fight, fought in the UK, perfect night for boxing 🥊
Bogus boxing
Wow, they were going at it!!!!
Kudos for both fighters! That was 🔥 Benn is my idol but Eubank is huge. Epic battle!!!!
I dk how eubank won benn tortured him
What an absolutely amazing fight
Im teaching my kids real state 😅
Christ I cringed at that ref at 0:14 trying to make a scene and make it about him
The boxing technique was lacking at times, but both guys gave every  ounce they had at the end 🥊💥
Now that's entertaining!
sensational fight im sorry it was not a 4 round win it was 1 round or a draw in my opinion
💥💥💥 both warrior's hats off Connor relentless pesuit
Is Eubank still training with Roy ? He reminded me of him at certain moments of the fight
Would watch the rematch. What a fight... Jr deserved the W but Benn could have taken it also
I wanna see them again....REMATCH
😅ss2      ❤❤❤❤❤  ❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤ is
What a great fight. 2 warriors going toe to toe 👍🏻
Glitch in the matrix at 2:52 😂
What a fight! Both men went to war for their father’s legacies and gave their all from start to finish.
Haven’t seen a fight like that for such a long time they both have everything. Was amazing to watch!!!
Eubank.jr moved will given his.obvious size advantage.
Best reviews I ever seen of a fight! Gotta watch the full fight now after reading these reviews 😮
Clean fighter won in the end
Thank you
3 min highlights for a fight that was thrilling the whole 12 rounds cmon now
Proppa scrap tha fare play to the both of them 👌🏻
Warrior within
Brawl of the year... Even with the family story, that fight wins the same unfair-play award that Canelo vs Jermell, with lesser skills (and then more upset potential).  Are you not entertained? No you're not! and there'll be a revenge, since both of them don't have much way to go, except their national scene boosted by family rivalry. To quote a toxic chica:  'That's boxinghood, baby!'
Awesome fight. I don't think Chris was at 100% but still fought like that.
Best fight ive seen so far this year the best thats real boxing
The fight literally made my buttocks quiver like jelly, it was that thrilling and exciting! GREAT fight and they both gave it their all. People thought I was trying to twerk as my buttocks were shaking uncontrollably.
Imagine losing against a dehydrated opponent. Benn is such a fraud.
Thanks to both Fighters❤ Thats boxing and because of fights like this i still love the sport. Sometimes hard to love it with guys like Jake Paul but this is real boxing🤩
They’re missing 11 more rounds of highlights here
This Fight Didn't Get It's Full Appreciation Due To The Corruption Exposed In The Sport By The Integrity Of One Of The Fighters & His father (The Only Fighter In My Opinion)
What a fight, respect to both fighters!
Robbery of the Year
Guts and heart from both, both winners in a lot of people’s eyes now
Respect to both fighters, did their dads proud and enhanced the meaning of Eubank vs Benn  Warriors
I'm just trilled they gave the audience a show. This is the joy of a promoter.
Who ever edited this is a complete idiot
Can we please have a round of applause for the Referee, Top man not like that muppet Howard Foster
2 Absolute warriors.  Did themselves and their family name proud.
Felt like I watching their father’s fight. From a 58yr old gentleman fellas, outstanding.
What a fight and I only watched the highlights.
Well wishes to Eubank family.  Euuuuubanks
What a sloppy non tatical figjt this was. Nothing close to what their fathers fights were. That's a slap in the face and insult to the legacy thier fathers left behind. From what it looks like neither one have completely learned the basis fundamentals of boxing. Other than a few jabs here and there, a lot of wild haymakers thown that were unnecessaty. Honestly though if you had to pick which one you thought actually won, then cleary as sloppy as it was, then Connor should have won. No ands, if's or but's about. I mean come on people at least heep it honest and real.
Boxing at its finest! What a fight.
No fight can beat this one man
This was old school! I hope that they will be ok going forward. Fights like these are known to change fighters' lives.
DRAW
And the winner is………Boxing 🎉
Legendary
35 min fight, 3 mins of highlights..... What a joke
Eubank, how Sway? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Looked like I was watching a slower Roy jones
Nice one Sir Eubank Jnr. Against all the odds you delivered the result. Snr.  should now be proud. You are not a bragger but you’d have the right to do so 🙏🏾🤜🏾👏🏾
Thst didn't look like a unanimous decision to me maybe Conor benn should move and fight in America that's crazy
Legendary fight they certainly carried on the family legacy. We do boxing right over here. 🇬🇧
kudus to both fighter
Even if they happened 10 matches, Eubank looks more stable, more mature and more solid.
Wow such a brutal fight. I thought Benn won though
Fight of the year
Benn is a great guy.147 pounds to middle weight with such a spectacular show he won the fight
Magnificento😊😊😊
Looked like a draw really
Great fight. Both come out with massive credit
The fans got their money's worth. The fans deserved what they got. This was a British affair and nothing more. Eubank Jr looked flat. Hope the two fighters can just move on from this and leave it be. The promoters need to put the fighters first going forward. Benn doesn't need to prove anything else with this match-up and Eubank Jr needs to get on his bike and have one last go at securing a credible world title.
Both men stood in the center of the ring and fought it thoroughly. No one took to the ropes... legendary boxing right there.
Senior was right… too much brain damage for his son
Cant remember last time a fight had me stood up swinging 😂
This was brutal, both men gave it all…respect!
Amazing fight well done both 💪
TOUCH THEM AGAGH
My dads bigger than your dad….. Looked like two Jack russels going at it, Backwards roll was particularly nice,,,,,, Winner fights Jake Paul, Tyson, and fury’s dad, Then island boys  What a time to be alive
Just watched the highlights and they definitely make it seem like Benn won
Eubank jr showed shades of Roy Jones Jr
Great fight, great for british boxing
Clinch fight
That was an instant classic, it lived up to the hype
My full respect for both men, Fight of the year. Ben is just too small. Both won tonight 👍
Both men put all there heart and soul into the fight a absolute war, Massive respect to both of these warriors and thank you gentlemen for a truly amazing fight.
Chris might of won but connor did what he said hed do an broke his jaw... job done
Who is next? Eubank vs Janibek!!!
Wow, what a fight. the best fight I've ever watched live. Credit to both boxers for putting on a great show.
Probably worst judging performance iv ever seen  Eubank won 118-110 minimum  Hopefully benn gets stopped and hurt in next fight
Ref made himself look a bit of a mug didn't he at the rule reading "touch gloved now, touch them! Ahh ahh ahh"   Stub his toe or soemthint?   They're not obligated to touch gloves matey.
Horrendous commentary.
Chris looks way bigger  and was just throwing his body to push Conner back.
WARRIORS. They stepped up. They're out from beneath their respective fathers' considerable shadows now. Class fighters.
Why only three minutes DAZN?
Tough men. Brutel fight
The only time I’ve seen such a size and weight difference between opponents is in the heavyweight division. If Conor was the same weight as Eubank then giant titanium testicles was the reason.
Sorry that was benns fight all the way unfair choice that was plus eubank is the biggest muppet in the world
Thats the fight that we pay to watch. Great fight.👏
Ridiculous. One guy is about two weight divisions heavier
Eubank clearly won.
I had it 9-3 Eubank   You need to watch the fight back if you think it was close or a draw ? 😂🤦🏻‍♂️  I thought the fight was very entertaining & full of drama  but technically it was  poor & very scrappy.  In other news I’m Buzzing for Jnr & absolutely over the moon Eddie, matchroom & team benn lost every mental battle &  the fight they don’t deserve anything apart from the battering they got ! 🥊😬😂
Wow what a battle i say it was a draw haha
I think Benn won that fight
Robbed clearly
Definitely fight for the year Conor Benn and Eubank , both their family legacy will live on in the Boxing Hall of Fame🔥🔥🔥🙌
No brain judges that had it 8-4 need to sweep toilet floors for a living....this was a close fight I had Eubank winning by 1 round
Eubank Family-2 Connor Family-0 😂😂😂😂
Great fight there has to be a rematch
Benn is a great fighter, but Eubank is too tall and too strong
Coldest staredown
The heavy weights should come and learn from these 2..this is the fight of the century
The highlights clearly don't do the fight justice or show how Eubank Jr won the fight.
Instant classic indeed.
That ref was team benn clearly
Unanimous I felt a split decision would have been fair ..Connor won some rounds too...either way respect to both fighters
Eubank vs Jake Paul make it happen. Don’t wuss out Jake, best fight you will ever have.
The thumbnail 😂😂😂
EVENT OF THE YEAR
If tank gets a draw Ben gets a draw 😮
Tenacity oooooo
Will have to watch full fight. This looked like all-out war!
This was supposed to be Eubanks biggest and easiest win ever, but...
This makes for a terrible 3min highlight video. Needs 10mins.
Respect for both giant , what a fight been
Even tho Connor lost it's still a win for him. The size factor came in to play. He has the potential to do great things still. It was great to see them both humble post fight also.
Their dad's  were  proud
A real battle between two real worriors.
That was a oldschool war. Something you watched in the 90s and back.
Trilogy please
Warriors hearts. The jab from Chris was the difference. True classic
Finally a fight that lived up to the hype
Eubanks much bigger
Rematch
Too soon for fight of the decade? Asking for a friend...
Nice Fight...but unanimous is not
I see that Roy Jones Jr in Eubank Jr.! Anybody else?
Man they brought boxing back with that one, Stellar performance by both guys, I am now a fan.
Boots vs benn!!
Skipped from round 8 to 12 😂 terrible hightlights
Dear Saudi  Take note.  All the money in the world doesn’t buy atmosphere.
Ben fought bravely
The last few rounds were INSANITY. Felt like non stop adrenaline the way they both wouldn’t stop swinging, just straight HANDS. Pair of warriors.
What an amazing fight! It crushed every expectation.
I didn’t think either fighter had that level in them what a fight
Black bald vs brown bald
With all the thing stacked against him Eubank still pulled through. Cracking fight
Interesting
Total respect for both Atheletes, amazing stamina and skill.
Next time maybe eubanks should actually come in the proper weight and use his weight bully tactics
Didn’t dissapoint
BS both fighter is too soft af worst fight ever
Run it back
TOP level of boxing
What a magnificent fight.....The best bout I've witnessed in years ❤🎉
fist time to hear these boxers
Eubank won, but Benn didn't really take an L. What a fantastic fight.
this that marvin hagler an thomas hearns energy 🔥🔥🔥 we need more of this.
Eubank is much bigger than Benn.
DAZN must have been disappointed cos Chris Eubanks didn’t give them talking points in the fight to try to score it for Benn
I have to watch the fight. Cause the highlights look like Benn won to me
What a fight Conor was a just the maller fighter but a dog
Two strong chins or two weak punchers?
I’m only watching the highlights but how did Eubank win??
Both winners! What a fight
Well the hifhlights gave it to Connor Benn tbh
i think conor ben is a great fighter, even he's lose.
For a guy that has to cut a lot of weight and could not rehydrate properly, this is amazing…
Now this is boxing
Benn waa by far the smaller guy here. The fact that he could hang for 12 rounds is nothing to sniff at.
SICK fight! Non-stop aggressive action. big props to Benn for stepping up like this. Dude shone
that's a robbery guys
What an incredible fight. Both fought like warriors for the whole 12 rounds
Definitely one of the best fights we’ve ever seen without a knockout absolute warriors a draw would’ve been fair
3 Minutes is an Insult! The whole fight was a highlight!
I was there - the stadium 🏟️ was ELECTRIC ⚡️ WOW big love to both fighters - they made history 🙏💥
Judges ruined it, abzolute war and should have been scored closer  4 rounds is way off
English boxing is boring most of the time when they come to America they always lose
Benn deserved this
Benn looked like he wanted to cry
Eubank way match bigger than Benn. At least 8 to 10 kg difference at the moment between two fighters.
No won really remembers what belts fighters won ,you remember the fights and the fighters and where you was when you watched the fight .i watched this fight with my 2 sons and wife and we was cheering Eubank on all the way this will stay with me forever,you are a true gladiator Chris eubank jnr
bro got rocked million times and still won poor decisions poor reff decisions
Top class.
Yup this is the fight of the year. Boxing won tonight.
Nada de que avergonzarse ni para agachar la cabeza señor Benn. Que pelea, que peleon wow
Now run it back so Eubank Jr can make weight and be on a LEVEL playing field. Great fight!
Jesus loves you-!
Benn won that fight
Such I great fight , I dislike eubank and love benn but credit to them both done there fathers proud , eubank won the mental battle , certainly affected benn performance, but an amazing battle both warriors
Somebody buy the movie rights now
What no black fighter running around the ring for 12 round 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
This is British boxing at its very best!
Machines
Benn did very well
Fight of the century
A welterweight vs a middleweight
Conor ain’t the same after he was spotted with them PEDs few years ago
The true winner is Benn for coming up in two weight classes, Eubank is a clown and just like his daddy.
Conor Bent got dog walked
Canelo would sleep both lol
What a fight, now this is boxing 🎉❤
I hope they respect each other now . They should do .
Total, absolute, unmitigated Warriors!!! Massive respect.
Benn not tested for peds eubank to dehydrated
I have so much respect for Conor Benn. Eubank had every physical advantage but Connor was still in there, giving Eubank the business
Also the winner is supposed to fight canelo is gonna ko eubank.
buena pelea pero hay que ser honestos. Eubank es un 168 enorme que fallo el peso, en el recorte se miraba muy mal. Inclusive hoy en el doa de la pelea podemos ver como no se reupero, absolutamente nada ya que no podia pasar de las 170 lbs. Prácticamente subio drenado y se ve en sus musculos. Que Conor Benn no pudiera mandarlo a la lona es lamentable ya que Conor es un 147 grande, pasa las 160 lbs fácilmente cuando rebota peso. Buen show y buena pelea y aunque fue emocionante, nos dice mucho del porque no son clase A en sus respectivas categorias. No leo lloros.
It all "boiled" down to another epic Eubank Benn
Fight of the year standing toe to toe throwing bombs
Awesome fight but Eubank Jr deserved that win
Snake Hearn did everything in his power to get the win for his man but still lost.
Super Fight..💪🤜👍
two warriors. Even though EUBANK got his jaw broken!! Great fight
Eubank thought it was going to be a walk in the park Connor prove everyone wrong 😂😂😂
I didn't see the whole fight, but seeing this clip, how did Chris win? Can someone explain to me?
Benn is a lot smaller - massive kudos
Bro got robbed
Cant stand that commentator
Fair play boys.
The right man won!
That's a boxing match 👏  Jake Paul 😂😂😂
Better than any YouTuber boxing fight. Boxing should be reserved only for pedegreed professionals.
He took a sweetie
Robbery
Turki cashing out on this one 😂 what a night for boxing
Look like Benn won it to me judging by the highlights
Honestly I don’t even know who should win it
1:36 Beautiful ...
Mayweather never had a single fight like this. That’s why he’ll never be remembered as one of the best for me. Did he go undefeated? Yes. Did he make a lot of money? Yes. Did he ever put on a show of all out war for his fans? Nope.
This fight’s promotion was mental. 🔥🔥🔥
These guys were fighting like they been the worst enemies theyre whole life lol...  Amazing fight
Fight of the year?
Well that was disappointing for two men that said they would destroy a fight, no knockouts no blood, both played it safe after so much talking, pathetic.
It's a draw!!!...
I love this!
Benn went up in weight, was the smaller man by a mile and still looked impressive...
Both guys showed huge heart and left it all in the ring, can't ask for more than that. The rematch would be great to see.
Great christ
Watch the full fight, they made sure to make it look like conor had the edge with these highlights
The size difference is bigger.
Fight of the year
📌 This was proper dust-up between 2 men who carry their father's names and legacies.
One of the most over hyped fights I’ve seen in years
Nice!!
Both of them were warriors in every sense of the word . I want more. I just fuckn love it
Fight of the decade
Well done 👏
Locking st the crowd you would think this fight was in Dubai that's crazy
Like fathers like sons
Hey, much respect to both of those guys - left it all out there.
12 rounds condensed into 1 minute
If ever there was 2 winners... these 2 are!!
Eubank was by far the better boxer who landed the cleaner shots whereas benn showed heart & determination but was ultimately missing wildly with a lot of shots. From a technical viewpoint as a boxing match eubank was a clear winner but as a fight it was close but to be fair Benn was never going to outbox eubank his tactic was to basically turn it into a street fight.
Wow both men left everything in the ring what a fight !!!!!!!!!
i must say they both fight like a warrior
Fight of the year 🎉
Benn won this fight how did punching bag black mungia won? commentators glazing eubank the whole fight while doing nothing was hilarious lol reminds me of tank getting beat in his last fight. Robbery.
How are they in the same weight class?
Connor is a mad man, this man swings with no fear
That was a draw, unanimous? Great fight
That's a fight!!!!! Respect
체급 차이가 너무 나네요...
I pray they dont run it back, otherwise one of them may end up on a wheelchair.
They know that they had to be as tuff as their fathers were
What a fight
One of the guys was waaay too small.
Proppa' tear up!
Now that he has been humbled, maybe I might actually start liking Conor Benn
They lived up the the hype of their fathers' fight.
Two. Warriors.
Benn looks 2 weights down
When the fight actually lives up to its expectations.👌
Benn too emotional from the get go.
Robbery and Benn deserves a rematch
Weak British fighter. C level fighters… King Ryan or Vergil Ortiz would knock them both out on the same night  🇲🇽🇺🇸
Brilliant brilliant fight lived up to the hype and some👏👏thank you💯💯
classic fight. wow. The courage and tenacity of these two men,  There were no losers in there tonight.
Black shorts looks like he's on a mountain of peds.
Respect to both warriors!! Best of British boxing, rivalry, old school slug fest… very rare these days
Wht a fight and.u could clearly see the power in connor he looked vicious out there
I see a draw 🔥🔥
Magnificent fight between two absolute warriors. These guys are dogs! They left everything in that ring. Boxing won tonight!
Congratulations Chris
They need to rematch.
So much better than expected 😆
That was intense
No defense just blocking punches with their Faces
That was a dog fight right there. Benn looked smaller than Eubanks and still held his own respect. Great fight.
One of the best fights ever
Great fight even they never should fight, not same weight class. Respect for both.
Look like a draw
What a fight!
First round was fire and the combination are just beauty
robbery
amazing fight. weird score cards it should show more respect to Benn but overall modern classic
In all the years I boxed myself until major shoulder injury and being a boxing fan finated this was honestly the best fight I’ve watch live since I’ve been alive (only 1999)
This reminds me of the fights during the seventies and eighties.
A light heavyweight fighting a welterweight. Wow!
How can you be not romantic about British boxing
Hold your head up Benn you fought a helluva fight.
What was the weight discrepency? Ben seemed much the active one
Benn showed decent chin. In the end he was outwork. Both did their fathers legacy proud.
Let’s talk about the fight !  Talk about the event  Talk about the commentary team  Talk about the Stadium  Talk about the pure drama  Take a bow ring magazine  Eubank and Ben will live forever .
COngrats to eubank jr,keep ya head up benn
Props to both fighters man they both dug deep and faced some adversity but kept on fighting. This is what boxing is all about and will be remembered for the rivalry.
Eubank jr comunque è bello gonfio!! Secondo me ci stava un pari
Great Chris eubank ❤❤
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What a fight 👊👊👊
Really was a great fight.
Eubank looks so big than ben wth ..
That was BRUTAL.
Eubank looked bigger and had a weight advantage.   They should run it back
Eubank SR turning up for the fight gave JR the edge, deserved winner
On these 3 min highlights it was a clear draw! But I'd give to Benn for being more aggressive and constantly going forward forcing the fight. Benn made the right, Eubank was always fighting on the counter. 🧐
They even wore the same shorts in the same colors as their fathers did when they fought each other
I’ve on.y seen the highlights, but respect to them both, it was a great fight from what I’ve seen.  Closer than maybe it was scored, but Eubank deserved the win.
Sr must be proud
UD for Chris is just absurd, I gave MD for conor. Chris got the UD Vic only because turki thinks he has better chance of dealin Canelo than Conor coz he is bigger than Conor. I gave credits to conors Chin, also his power, he wobbled bigger Chris few times
Guaranteed fight of the year 🎉🎉
Dazn are quality showing the highlights so soon. Take note Sky, TNT and UFC.. bunch of thieves starving the fans for your profits!
What an amazing fight
dazn and eddies propaganda highlights
Props to both young men, easily contender for fight of the year. Did it live up to its hype? 1000% I had Eubank jr ahead by the slightest margin.   Easily contendership for fight of the year
Best Fight in the Modern Boxing.
I think was a draw.   I guess a rematch. As now days is boxing is all about money
Run that back immediately!! Connor Benn showed he aint no chump, even though I had Eubank Jr to win, Benn is a savage for reals!!
CHRIS EUBANK defense is WEAK-he always has his left hand down which is why he is hit so often by BENN.
Highlights only show half the story the fight build up didn’t disappoint if you get a chance should watch the fight in it’s entirety I know they both made their fathers proud the way they went to war congrats to both men ..
RUN IT BACK. Scored it a draw.
Right decision, but wrong score cards imo so much closer, and if Benn won wouldn’t have been overly surprised either way
Glad to see a decent fight for once.
I ain’t no boxing fan nor do I know much about it but this was a Fight, unlike AJ’s and other big fighters. Chris , well done. 😊
Bigger Eubank
This is  the fight that I love to watch.🎉🎉
Most entertaining fight I've seen in years
Looks like an amazing fight. I will watch the full thing.
Are these people in the same weight class?
This was probably one of the best fights I've went out of my way to watch in a while.
Jab won the fight
Brilliant Fight both put the work in well done Chris
These were close rounds but when you look at punching totals it helps paint the story… Benn was throwing a lot but didn’t land nearly as much as Eubank, also just comparing the quality of punches Eubank takes the cake, the biased commentators made it seem way closer than it was lol
I'm not the biggest fan of either, but as boxers by heck that was some fight! From start to finish it was relentless. Both fighters shown great heart out there and gave the fans a proper war!!  Congrats to both men
This fight was better then there fathers fight
Absolutely stupendous display
Both are warrior, not running🙏👊. Compare to other fighter, the strategy of being running🤣
Terrence Crawford should fight one of these two before chasing Canelo
I thought this was a cash out fight nah this was generational reputation on the line.
That sequence at 2:05 is like a movie. Couldn't have been a better fight.
Coocking 🫣 best thief
Waiting for the grandkids now
Eubank is an absolute stud in that ring
Talk about a perfect ending for Chris
Ok, y'all got me here..went in thinking that this was a really forced fight just cause of their pops' names, but they really were slugging tf out there and put up a barn burner..that 12th round got me active frfr 😅
Highlights don’t do this fight justice tbh
Benn robbed i’d say!
Definitely the fight  of the of the year I'm from New York City and I was having a panic attack 😂😂😂 to both fighters my hats
One of the best fight of this era . Salute both fighters
The bad blood will turn to wine between these guys in a few years when they realize they were both in a classic for the ages
Yes yes
Eubank please don’t fight Canelo you have zero defense!
Conor Benn's chin is made of iron and anger.
Wow , what a fight, Ben won't stand a chance if ubank jr was in his normal weight class 🎉
Definition of let the hands do the talking what a fight 🫡
Yoo crazy fight hats off to both but Ben is a champ small guy puttin work
Stupendous.
A pair of absolute dogs
Let Connor go down to 147 so Ryan Garcia can put him to sleep.
Funny how drained eubanks jr beat the walking 4 division champ Conor benn
Eubank was dead at the weight
I've never seen a fight like this.
What a fight! Can’t wait to see the rematch
My wife was in labour on the night of the first fight (their dad’s 30 odd years ago). Had to call for an ambulance, never forget either it was manic. Looks like these two went at it 110%. Amazing.
This is wat people should watch wen we watch boxing. Not gimmick like jake paul vs whoever
Proper tear up🤣👏
The winner by majority decision: The FANS!!!!!
War
Crazy precision skills by Eubank
It was a great fight. Benn with this fight proved he belongs right at the top n could go toe to toe n possibly even beat against the likes of haney, garcia, etc... crawford may b a little far fetched but the boy's got it.
Reminds me of 90s
Great fight! Throwback to what boxing was in the 80’s and 90’s.  We need more of this.
This is one of the best modern boxing matches I have ever seen. You could see flashes of their fathers within some of the clashes they had. Nothing but respect for both of them.
A 147 Benn fughting a 160 guy is crazy. 😂
Ben is a children for Chris
For sons of former boxing champions who were extra ordinary in their prime... I see no boxing here.  This was a slug fest.   Both men can't move for shyte. Their defensive game is abysmal. If their boxing development continues along this trajectory, they can never square up against champions in any division.
Benn u deserve a world title ..
Neither one of these foos could not beat a Mexican. Mexicans stay dominating blacks in all sports. Mexicans run boxing
This is war ,this boxing..no running
😮what a fight.... definitely fight of the year so far
Both are real WARRIORS!!!
Great fight
Now that’s a fight 💪wow got me off my feet
That was history
Meh, neither one is world title level.
Brutal
Amazing fight wow I called it a draw
WOW!!!!!!
not the mismatch I though it would be - well done to both gents
Great fight it really lived up to the hype
Looks staged
Conor benn great performance end the better man for sure
3 min? 😂
Benn for is the win 🔥
the arrogant will lose
Eubank Jr probably had 20.lbs on Benn after rehydration
I think Connor won this fight
Epic - respect to both Warriors
Ito ang pinaka magandang laban
This is what we called BOXING 🎉🎉🎉
This how you end the last round. No Gayweather running away from your opponent.
Eubank alot technically better than Benn, plus imagine if Eubank didn't have to cut that much weight...
Para mi esto fue arreglado sin lugar a dudas
DAZN is slowly but surely becoming a disgrace with their biased commentary .. we get it, Benn is with Hearn and fights on DAZN but please try to be impartial for once 👍🏾 did the same thing for Beterbiev v Bivol
Dang, i missed watching the fight live, but you can tell it was a heck of a fight already!
Sayang pukulan keras Connor ering miss
2 real fighter toe to toe blow by blow
This was war 🔥
I'd watch this fight 10x more than any shakur stevenson fights😂😂
I have to watch this fight from the beginning and not the highlights ! I would have Ben winning by ko or by a split decision at worst!!!
FOTY!!! 🔥🔥🥊
He loss just like his daddy
Ben has an iron chin !!!!
Chris eubank looks a few weight classes bigger than Conner
Robo
Benn has no power on  mdlwght
It's like two cavemen fighting, no strategy
No robbery.. just real.fight.and action
Dam the size difference in there was massive. Looked like a 30 lb difference in there.
What an incredible fight! Feel like I’m watching a movie! Shout out both fighters!
Fight of the year!
Conor Ben boxes like an regular street fighter, zero boxing IQ just pure heart. His fathers legacy is the only thing saving him.
What a fight
this was an absolute masterpiece, a classic no doubt
Benn won that fight 💯
Finally
Significant size disparity
They let a cheater win
Great fight ben showed heart in this fight, eubank was a warrior he showed grit
Cmon Eubanks 😎
Biggest fraud ever at worse was draw and if anyone won by point was Benn never watching boxing again
The refree In the beginning . Touch them now aahhh ahh LOL what was all that about
Both  threw punches like there was not tomorrow.  Both never tried to pull off a super boring Coward Fraud Mayweather/Shakur Stevenson 🤡 for 12 sad annoying rnds.      Awesome fight - boxing fans clear winners 👏
the right decision , although i dont think chris was at his absolute best, but did enough to win anyway.
Yuss CEJ   New eggs and still got it done
Say whatever you want about these 2 but their both as tough as their old men and both deserve a monumental amount of credit on multiple levels as do both their fathers for doing such a grand job in raising 2 quality athletes.  🥊
Would you like a Sweetie?
Eubank looks like a light heavy weight lol dang
interesting boxing not running
Wow! I was waiting for someone to get knocked down or KO’d but that was better than both!!!! FOTY!!
Benn. Got. ROBBED.
Say what you want these boys gave everything. Been a long time since I’ve seen a fight like this.
Man they were fighting like the females all those slaps and no technique.
Boxing needs better promoters. This should of been a way bigger fight with all the anticipation
Absolute banger.
Hats off
Eubank was lucky fighting a smaller guy
Great fight.
What a War!!!!!
Their fathers should be proud.
No one cares about this fight
What a great fight!!!!
Props to both fighters. Benn definitely did some damage to Eubank 100%
Quality fight
Could have been a draw
I haven't watched the full match but couldn't this have been a draw?
They fighting so hard the ref bleeding 😂
Rematch
I still can’t believe Connor benn lost this fight what a joke
Rematch!! Run it back
Rematch incoming
Absolutely magnificent
The fight is like a movie, Crazy!
Boring. like father like son.
Bro this look like some videogame shi....🎯
That was a draw
A classic.  Just like the classic their daddies put on decades before.
One of the best fights of all time
Wow that was a great fight
Curious...anyone else score the fight unanimous?
Eubank looks huge compared to Ben but well done to Ben for trying. Theres weight classes for a reason
Great fight. 1st half Benn. 2nd half with a bullet Eubank.
This was a fight! Not a boxing match, a fight!!!
This was a really close fight I had it a draw
This was a BRUTAL fight. You can tell by the blood on the referee's shirt. American big fights are often super clean, unless its Tank Davis knocking out a can. lol
So much respect for those two. Wow 🙌
Connor Benn is clearly the better and more determined fighter, Chris Eubank is just twice his size.😅
From what I can see that was a f*****g  RUMBLE 🔥
Respect
Connor Benn was too small for what he was doing to be sufficiently effective enough.. it was David vs. Goliath ..and i think just  like with Sugar Ray Robinson vs Joey Maxim, towards the last 2 rounds, Connor Benn was gassing out trying to do something with Eubank's weight advantage.. AN ADVANTAGE THAT EUBANK MADE SURE HE HAD.. If a middleweight was fighting a middleweight.. Eubanks would have been carried out the ring to get to that hospital..
What a don Jr is!!!!!
Extraordinary fight‼️
It’s hilarious seeing all the praise after the initial hate BOTH got for getting this made 😂 boxing fans are their own worst enemies
You Brits box like your country is being taken over and you cant find anywhere to train....oh.....wait. These guys fight like novice boxers. Wild to see this as a big UK fight
very beautiful 🥊
Wow amazing
What a fight!!!!!!!!!!
Gotta watch the whole fight. Looked like a war.
The size difference is huge
Dude wasn't even at full potential due to rehydration clause and still won
what a fight
I’ll have to watch again.  I only watched the highlights.   But by the highlights. I think C.B took it 🤷‍♂️
Hopefully this fight get upload on YouTube to watch It, i missed the fight 😢
116-112 all judges is bit too much
THIS FIGHT IS TOO PERSONAL FOR BOTH BOXERS , AND THEY DID THE BEST BOXING PERFORMANCE SO FAR THIS YEAR🎉🎉
One of the best fights of the last 10 years
They should definitely run this back!!
I really thought we was gonna watch someone die in that ring. they both are warriors
What a fight!
Whatba nice battle ddnot afraid to punch they give ther best in boxing but only 1 can win the best fight hope rematch
I cant lie with all of the press conference antics i wasnt sure the fight would live up to the hype ,but the fact that it even overachieved it is crazy
Great fight by both men. Weight cut was clearly a challenge for Eubank, but overcame, performed and got the job done. Benn fought great, lots of positives to take from the fight from both boxers, not many can complain about the result.
Benn was just too out of control at times. Judges got it right.
robbed ...
Might be the best fight i’ve seen live alongside AJ Klitschko
What a stare down by Benn. Haven't seen anyone looking quite so mean since Holyfield
Proper British scrap
great fight. slight edge
i have to see the full fight. it looked like a draw from this highlights
I really believed that Chris would get knocked out. So happy for him. I hate Conor’s attitude
The g force of that push 1:12 made Ben fly back 😂 that’s how you know Eubank is too big and there’s weight classes for a reason but great fight.
Dudes a light heavyweight getting some serious leather from small middle weight. Eubanks should retire and never fight again
This what boxing was missing this whole years!!! This type of wars we used see it during the era of manny Pacquiao, Miguel cotto, Óscar de la hoya, Chávez and the list goes on and on!!!
That is legendary...micky ward autoro goti level
Absolute warezone
Take that rehydration clause out....and whoa lol Eubanks would've steam rolled ol chap. Now at least he has better negotiations for the rematch.
Everyone doubted eubank lol I knew he was gonna dominate 🔥🔥
The disparity is crazy eubank is just a much larger human
Love to see this!!!
🔥🔥🔥😈
A dog fight
Eubank won in the last 4/5 rounds
Benn smaller but definitely more powerful imo. Great fight tho id like to see it ran back ngl
Should have been a draw.
Absolute war. Both men left it all the the ring. Eubank just too big in the end. But I think it’s now clear to see that Benn’s power in previous fights was definitely boosted whether he knew or not that there was something extra in his body. He hit Eubank with some big shots and he just kept coming forward. Benn will win titles at 147 with he pure ferocity and heart but don’t think will see to many more stand out KO performances.
Just wondering why Eubank Jr wore Winning Gloves?  I swear their 10oz gloves are SO pillowy you can use them on the bag AND spar and your fists take absolutely no damage, and neither does anyone else lol.    They are for fragile hands much like Ringsides are, but a bit stiffer in the padding in front.  Why not use Campeons or Reyes or some such?  Everlast Powerlocks if they still use them also work well.
What a legacy these names carry 🛡⚔️
history repeats itself
Turki thank you sir.
definitely FOTY contender.. but never surpassed the bivol beterbiev fight
Fair play to both dudes
Eubanks dropped all weight to test his self even where his opponent was comfortable n if u don’t see the warrior in that u don’t know boxing that was dangerous n he had his father against him n everybody else salute
Definitely lived up to the hype.
Is this one of the best fights you ever seen or what? wow
BENN WONN EACH ROUNDS AXCEP ROUND 12
Am happy eubank win. 🎉
Run it back!
The Apple did not fall far from the tree with those two.
Now that’s what I call parliamentary
Great fight!
Eubank sealed that last round.
Wow!! That was guaranteed one the best fights ever! Warriors, both men. My kinda fight. They need 15 rounds.  👏💯💪👍👌✊️❤️
I fell asleep noooo
The sons of rival legends now 2nd generation rival legends.
That was elite hands 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eubank looked so much bigger
Run it back!!!!! Jr vs Jr 2
The reason why Benn was able to absorb Eubank Jr's shots because he never had to cut weight while Eubank Jr. had to. There shouldn't be any hydration clause period. Benn is a 147lb fighter and evidently, fought like one as well.   The only way I would watch a rematch if it's in a level plating field.
Eggcellent result even tough Hearn and the Benn's tried to scupper Jr's performance with a ReHydration clause, Smaller Ring, Lighter Gloves, £350k fine and then trying to get Billie Joe Saunders into his dressing room..Cheats never beat.. Unless its EGGS of course😂😂😂
Two strong Africans going toe to toe is quite a sight to see, great for the continent
Benn came to fight..
What a fight. Best one so far this year.  👏 👏 well entertaing
Thay robbed Ben 🤦‍♂️
Both animals but the real beast won
Ehh
only one fighter got hurt, and it wasnt benn.
How much did Chris take home
They need a rematch for sure 😂😂😂
SHAKUR STEVENSON LEFT THE GROUP 😂 This is the fight that people have been waiting for a long time
This is a drained Eubank and he did still great. Great fight. A rematch, Eubank Jr wins again. Same outcome.
They said it was an “influencer fight”, that both men had the opportunity to fight for a title and both turned it down for the money. To have seen either of them winning a belt nobody cares about would’ve been a bad decision. Long after their retirements people will talk about this fight. And that wouldn’t have happened unless they fought each other.
Benn bangs like a modern day Tyson, but Eubanks Jr.'s head movement is nice.
Benn should drop down in weight. Massively outsized and still put up a very decent showing.
Class😮 fight of the year!! Will be buying a copy of the dvd version or a documentary❤😂.
The ref was bit of a joke
Naw they gotta run it back. Fight of the year nominee
Huge size difference!!!
Pugilism at its finest 🔥
This is what boxing needs to get back to. You see this in smaller events but rarely do the big fights live up to the hype now days.
Yo benn totally won
This is what boxing is about 💯not the money it’s about leaving it all on the stage  against the best.
Just like he said bull and matador, but really means on the run, from raging anger
Even though he won. He still lost. Now I see why he will never be a world champ. Pillow hands Eubank couldn’t knock out a welterweight
Dang they really kept the legacy going?
Eubank edged it I would agree but winning by 4 rounds absolutely not. Hopefully they sort a rematch out.. benn deserves a rematch without a doubt.
conor benn can't fight at middle weight, he's a welterweight class. eubank is a monster, much bigger and taller. benn is a match for ennis and ortiz
This WHOLE experience,  just let's the world know how IMPORTANT FATHERS are to their children... senior being there for his son at the last moment, changed the whole outcome of the fight.
History repeats itself
Whattt a great fight!!!!!
There were 2 other fights I had as candidates for The Fight of 2025. This is the Fight of the Year easily!
These "highlights" are still bias towards benn even after him losing, eubank won by 1 or 2 rounds it was a great fight but the commentary was benn pro
What a fight
Respect lads, and I was no fan before 👍
please run it back
That was a great fight. The whole fight was a highlight. Fight of the year so far 🥊🇺🇸
Excelente
Floyd and Shak,Haney left the boxing group or arena😅😅😅
Conor benn vs boots next
They both won and the fans got value for their money respect to the modern day gladiators 🫡🫡
This reminded me of the Classic Mexican fights . Both gave their best
Conor benn will defeat eubank in their rematch
Wow!
Different fight if Jnr wasn’t so drained.
these highlights do it absolutely not justice. howve you missed Chris rocking Benn at the end of round 11 too?...
It’s been a long time since a fight actually lived up to the hype. Both deserve respect.
Amazing fight this is what boxing is about 💯
Connor Ben fighting a 175 semi heavyweight
Así se pelea canelo de mierda😂
This was a war.
Not a fan of Conor Ben but holy he earns my respect! Don’t be a fan of boxer, be a fan of boxing!
Brilliant display from both fighters. A rematch would be great. Congratulations to Eubank jnr but Connor Benn is a true warrior.
Eubank is big for benn.
BIG RESPECT to both men. Eubank deserved the win, Conor benn will become world champion soon .
My notes: Benn was focused on the showmanship from the beginning and had him gassed out from all the movement. Eubanks Jr. was focused on the clinch/length of the fight. Not the most technical fight but the modern Ward vs Gotti we all wanted. MAKE IT A REMATCH
🗣️THE PROCEDURE WAS PARLIAMENTARY!!!!!!
Great battle
Wow awesome fight highlights gonna watch the full thing
Jr won the respect of many but he definitely didn’t win that fight if anything it was a draw …..
If it was a Draw like I thought it was going to be, the storyline would of been ever greater!  Still a Great Fight 💯
I tell you what, I am so so glad I was able to watch this when it happened, what a fight.
EEeeedddiiiEEE!!!
Tottenham Hotspur stadium hasn’t been rocking that much all season. What an absolute battle!!!
Run it back
Nobody talking about Eubanks jab
Egg-xcelent. Absolute War. Well done lads.
Got to commend Conor for going 12rds with seasoned middle weight
Whoever thought Eubank didn’t have the heart for the sport can see their way out right now
Real Boxing, Finally. Loved it, much respect for both fighters.
Them boys was rumbling 🤝🏾
Cracking fight,far exceeded expectations. These two families need each other 😂
0:16 ohh Victor F off ffs if they don’t want to touch gloves just leave it be. Idiot.
Classic 3 mins of high lights
Benn got robbed
This is boxing we want to watch ❤
I want to see a rematch. Waht a fight!!!
Robbed again
Pantomime trilogy on rhe way
GREAT FINISH BY EUBANK & SALUTE TO SR FOR COMING
When i see this fight remind me the fight between pacqiaou and margarito..its show how great Manny pacqiaou was.only he can do that to fight a big man
Eubanks !!
Me screaming at 3 am watching the highlights fair play what a fight
size difference looks about right for a career welterweight fighting a middleweight
Brilliant exciting fight....but you could clearly see the massive difference of how the brilliance,  skill, technique etc etc was on display with their fathers in the Sensational  Benn V Eubank I ... A incredible fight.
Draw would’ve been a fair result. Classic!!!
This one is for Ryan Garcia.
Rematch in December at 160lbs?
No chance Benn was all over him
Based off highlights i expected split decision
looks like a welterweight vs a middle weight fighter the size different is huge
This is how I remember boxing. Thank you gentlemen.
2 kids who were bought up rich but were born to fight
They mostly arm punching. No power , wild swings. Low technical match up, looks very busy but all harmless
Ben has No fight control
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A proper boxing fight after years of waiting 🎉🎉
Amazing 👏 fight highlights 👍
Hopefully Eddie Hearn placed the bet!! The absolute melt 🖕
Congratulations to Eubanks on the win
No eggs no power
Brain damage shows up 10 years after trauma. These fights must end. No more dog and pony. Fight your weight. Stop this insanity.
What a joy to see Chris Eubank Sr celebrate 🎉🎉
I didnt take into account how small of a target Conor will be
Cero boxing technique from both fighters not exciting fight at all.
I WATCHED THE FULL FIGHT. THE RIGHT MAN WON, BUT CONOR BENN IS ONE TOUGH HOMBRE.
dang i watched the first half and i thought benn was winning. gotta watch whole thing
🤔
Keep fighting Benn.
Best fight i ever watched live since Castillo vs Corrales
Personally thought it was a draw, but if it had to go to someone, i agree with the call
What a fight benn has all my respect
How did Ben lose this ??? 😅
WOW. THE FANS WON.
Me parece que benn busco demasiado el knockout en la pelea, debió deser más técnico y paciente así hubiera ganado en las tarjetas aunque comprédo que quería dar un gran espectáculo y demostrar que es el mejor
Benn is bouncing off Eubank, weight class matters
You got your money’s worth
Poetic that Eubank provided the drug cheat with his first, unequivocal 0.
Both men decided to not get knocked down 😂😂 animals absolute animals
I thought Jr was gonna get him out of there in the 12th !!!
this fight must and should have a rematch!!!
When you hear connections like that while watching it , the sound at ringside would be 10X louder
HUMANITY IS SICK AND TWISTED BLOODTHIRSTY SOULS 😢😢😢
Descent fight.
Looks like a huge size difference  Bigger person wins
Eubank is so big, but great fight
Okay, Chris’s face was really puffed up after that fight. Well done
Instant fookin 'ellfire classic, bruv.
👏🏼 🫡
Fight of the century! Hands down! Name a better fight. With the hype, the history, the bad blood, the build-up, the war!
I would have to say they did their fathers proud.Congrats to both sons who lived up to a Royal Boxing Legacy to the Letter!!Boxing Won Here!!!!
When Canelo will do something like this?
This fight felt reminiscent of Ali vs Frazier. Can came out smokin and eubank had the jab going most of the fight. Idk what happened but eubank turned on the gas and just poured it on. He got wobbled a couple times too. Such a great fight. Def a minders day classic
Draw
Mazalina
Was never Eubank win score Cards were bulshit
So nice to see a hyped fight live up to the hype!!  Was a vey entertaining evening!!
Big respect for them They gave us a great performance
JESUS DIED FOR EVERYONE ON A CRUEL CRUEL CROSS JESUS WON FOR EVERYONE ALLELUIA JESUS WILL SOON RETURN TO MAKE A FOREVER LASTING BEAUTIFUL WORLD JUST BE READY TO MEET HIM PLANET EARTH IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME FAST ❤
WOW That looked something out of a movie. Almost unreal 🤯
Amazing fight
I'm still blown away there will be blood and blood was there that was a worrior end for both of em.❤
Straight warriors love it.
Canelo smokes em both.
Did the right man won or was it a really close fight that could’ve gone either way?
It takes two European black dudes to give us a real Mexican style fight! All other blacks fight scarrry Jab jab hug run… win by points!
Fight a year okay yeah whatever  Because if you want to be honest Eubanks didn't do all that much to Connor Ben..... I know people don't like counting anything a draw  In this ain't on any hating tight stuff this is just honesty and realisticness  Eubanks didn't do that much damage to Connor Ben honestly they went blow for blow Toe to Toe  But I am going to realistically say that I don't think mainly that Chris Eubanks won the fight   Y'all can say what you want and get mad makes me no never mind I said what I said it's just he did not fully win that fight  He was getting rocked with punches from Connor Bean, but he also gave some punches to Conor Benn but I really think it was a tie  So I stated as a draw and not know unanimous decision to Chris Eubanks that boy did not out do Connor being literally at all  Yeah it might be nice that he won the fight but to consider it being a blowout  That's a never I really think they should run that back and don't play no games about it
"PARALYZING TIMES "BY PROF WALTER VEITH POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH UNMISSABLE UNMISSABLE WATCH ❤
Great fight 🎉🍿
Fight of the 2020s.
Warriors like their fathers..
The better fighter won was absolutely mint to c that's what boxing 🥊 is supposed to be like middleweight boxing is absolutely amazing I want more of that
brain damage
Was this an episode of Dragon Ball Z!!!? Dang ! they was throwing them Hands lol
This is boxing.
What I thought Tank Vs Roach would’ve looked like..
Fight of the decade, and for the ages!!🔥🔥🔥😍 Cingrats to both fighters for giving the fans this amazing fight!!
Goku v vegeta 🫦We might need a pt 4
THIS IS AS DRAW
This is the true  boxing.. ❤❤
Best fight Iv seen in a long time absolute dog fight
FOTY
Can any of these guys beat canelo ?
I'd love a rematch, this time with no rehydration clause. Benn gets a chance to make adjustments to eubanks style, and eubank gets to be in the ring full and healthy.
Outstanding.
We need to see it again 💥
Its been a minute since we had a real grudge match even at the end they dint touch gloves at-least top 3 fight of the year candidate
I can't believe that eubank is ducking the shorter guy😂😂😂😂😂
I gotta watch the whole fight now
What a shame from Eubank. could have done so much better but had too much pride to take the other guy seriously. his dad was right
Conor benn had my respect.
Benn was clearly the smaller guy
Eubanks jr won by 1 or 2 rounds 🤔 close fight.Benn could not connect with his right hand
Bot gonna lie this one hurts to the benn family
Great of dazn to show near 100% of henns best yet only show 60% of CE's. Sad stuff from this channel
Fight of the history of boxing
Truly delivered
No way I didn’t think he win
Can we get part 2 please? A rematch??
These highlights will make you think he lost the fight❗
Thanks to both athletes. They gave us a great show.
Where's the £ eddie
what a fight! wooooo!
Beat him and dropped weight ICON
I was going for benn but I knew Chris was. A 168 and benn a 147 punder but man this was a fight early rounds benn late rounds chriss
I hope shakur and Haney were watching
😮😮😮
Most punches thrown ever
That's what we want to see in boxing, not some guy trying to catch a chicken in the ring
Fight was trash
Eubank jr can be such a beautiful boxer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Both of em are not beating American world champions
It's possible they win in unanimous 😂😂😂it's split to me
one of the best fights ive seen in my life. respect to both. was closer than 116/112 imo.
Like Mayweather says “I tip my hat off to both those guys” Respect 🫡
That is a Draw 👉
I love the boxing sense in UK! Respect
Conor Benn a threat at welterweight. Because he stood toe to toe with someone who two weight classes up
And this is why the undisputed boxing game needs to add more stamina lol
another rigged fight
Ben win
Great fight.. well done to both men… much respect
Eubank Jr. was clearley havier than Benn. Conor Benn´s punches couldn´t shook Cris Eubank but he looks pretty beat up now!
Benn ..the first time fight real class boxer😅😊😊
EUBANK
Eubanks won not by4 rounds though a bit to much had him winning by 2
Connor lacks combinations and counters,got the stamina and footwork though..while chris has stamina issues relying too much on jabs,..I think Connor wins this if he step the gas further😅
No rematch imo, this will go down as legendary in the sport of boxing. Both men
I get the whole warrior mentality in the pocket somewhere in the ring just fairly as possible trading, but eubanks was beautifully controlling him on the distance with jabs and sticking up until the 7/8th where he started to just willingly take it to the pocket and slug it out which made no sense cuz Conor clearly is the harder puncher from what it seemed.
What a scrap😭🔥
Run it back for a second
What a dog fight wow  😮
And Eubank did this while dehydrated
Lived up to the hype. Well done boys
Don’t get to see this - in the US - but have followed the hype and wind up - happy Eubanks won and grew that his Pops showed up !
Cant recall the last fight my heart was pounding this much especially having $ on it
WHAT. A. FIGHT.
Benn was robbed
These highlights don’t do the fight justice.
I think Benn won the problem was he got pummelled in the last round
2 Warriors 💯💯💯💯
What a great fight!
Scrappy at best
What was benn record??
Chris eubank jr was significantly drained in that fight. I can only imagine if he (Chris) was able to rehydrate to his normal size at 180-185 on Fight Night, would Conor Benn even have a chance in the bout. But it was a great fight, though, and a great win for Eubank Jr.
these guys are bringing back the old era!🔥🔥🔥
Weight drained him used dodgy gloves against him made him fight in a small ring all this after you fail ped tests against him. Justice was served in so many ways tonight
The 12th round had me shadow boxing in my living room😂😂😂
Robo total!
Rematch !
Garbage job on putting together these highlights - Benn PR team on overdrive
Put a rehydration clause on Chris and still lost😂😂
connor looked undersized but still moving forward trading blows.. what a fight..
Great fight I’m glad Eubank won this fight he went threw way more adversity and still can out on top ❤
They look so much alike I get names mixed up
I would make a terrible boxing judge then because I sincerely thought Benn was better.
Conor Benn has heart, for a small dude to fight this BIG💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
This was the first time I'd seen Eubank Jr. with such concentration.
Draw! Rematch!
Bennett was too impatient
CONGRATS TO CHRIS FOR THE WIN & CONOR SHOULD EARN EVERYONE RESPECT COZ HE SHOWED HOW DAWWG HE HAS IN HIM
Conner is a beast and fosure have better skill than eubank but the size advantage make him win
It felt like an old-school boxing match, both men gave it everything, respect.
Definitely a war and dynamic fight!!!
3 minutes? should be 20 minutes
This was supposed to be Spence-Crawford 😥
Big boy vs big heart ❤️
I want a rematch
These highlights do not do this fight justice. Poor from DAZN.
Great fight let down by the scoring , Benn did not deserve to lose 116-112 , draw or close win either way.
The fact that Conor Benn was eating power shots and at times he was backing up Eubanks 😳😳😳😳😳
Benn took some vicious shots how did he stay standing
Бен ниразу не нахимичен верю 😅
Only 3 minutes of highlights?
Benn could have won if he didn't take it too personal and took his time to pick HIS SHOTS.
They robbed conor!!
Proper scarp
Not bad. Looks like Jr. is a bit past it. Bravo to both men.
Wow what a show from these 2 and I haven't seen the full fight
Definitely fight of the year 🫡💯allgasnobreaks
Eggcellent Fight!!
This fight could've went either way
Classic🎉❤
What a fight, real men real boxing no BS
This will be an instant classic, what a fight, no! what a war.
This needs to be made into a movie
Big props for uploading this so fast
This is  the real boxing
Goku vs Vegeta type ish 💥 👊🏾😲
What a helluva fight contender for fight of the year
This was absolutely brilliant fight 🔥🔥
EUBANK JR BABYYYYY 🔥🥊
Remach
Absolutely one of the greatest fights i have seen in a long long long timebravo to both Warriors for making it happen.  It was a joy to watch 💯 % A grade.
Eubank showing experience in that fight deserved the win but both men were sensational they brought the best out of each other
The size difference was quite noticable.
Thing is about Benn, like his Dad , it was about emotion. EUBank was all about business
This is how boxing should be . Tired of bs unknown champs here and there . Best gotta fight the best
Run it back....... Connor Benn tough as nails
Eddie Hearn finna cry in the car
What a madness and respect to both for putting on a fight for the decade
Benn robbed
It’s funny how not a single shot of Benns in round 3 was shown tho
Ben won that
A legendary feud that lived up to the hype.
They have to run this back
Great fight. THIS WAS WAR
Holi moli!
Benn pushed too hard early. That aggression and explosiveness wasn't sustainable throughout the fight.
Too small at 160
proper scrap this lads
🔥🔥🔥🥊👊💯
Eubank is such a G. Everything stacked against him. Rehydrationcl clause , drug cheat , age and he dogged that out. Amazing fight.
Eubank won that ffs 😮 fixed
We gotta have another one!  I bet Benn shut up alot of people.  No one expect it to go the distance.  🇦🇬✊🏾🇵🇷
Both fighters did amazing 👏 Great Fight!!!!
Conor Benn made the Fight Exciting not so much Chris who looked Sluggish and out of Energy. Conor had way more better moments than Eubanks and what these Highlights show.
Didn't  happen  as these  foods  though
Benn is a beast, what a warrior🤯
That was the most I’ve ever seen Eubank give in a fight. Fantastic effort
I can smell some godly TikTok edits off this master piece !
This fight was amazing.. the left it all out in the ring. no winner nor loser in my opinion. this is a classic
Why do DAZN fighters always lose. Do you think it's karma for using such deplorable people as Eddie Hearn to do business with?
buzzin Chris Snr turned up, no way was he letting paps down.
If jr wasn’t drained he wins by knockout eazy
Ben coming up 2 weights and not going on back foot
Come on dazn.. 3 minute highlights, what is this a pbc event?? You can't claim its fightbof the year if the whole fight wasn't action packed.
Benn is trash
Classic
All these great fights in boxing and the UFC can't even make Jones vs Aspinall...
They fought for their fathers , nice
Eubank took it. But Benn reminds me of a mini Mike Tyson
Proud he's a Brightonian. Well done
the pace of this fight was brutal, highlights? all of it was highlights! 🥊
I hate it when ref force boxers to touch. You don't do that ref
This is was a clash of warriors fighting🔥 Much respect to both fighters.
The crowd got their moneys worth with this one
There was no true loser in this fight. Nobody will EVER forget what these two men did.
Whats with the 3 judge win for Eubank? It was a draw if you ask me and just look at the face on Eubank. Yes, it was scrappy and messy but professionals avoid this when facing a shorter boxer. Eubank was sloppy and lazy and far from what he has been. I don't think I will watch a rematch as the big heads have the judges in their pockets!
I knew it would end like this but Conor brought the fight.
Absolutely insane fight was on the edge of my seat!!
Stupendous fight. They both have my respect..fight of the year thus far..they should run it back..
Wow this fight was so trash. Both fighter with no defense or offense
Finally a proper scrap.
What a fight .. wow thank you to both of you.. and senior being there made might night extra.. the place erupted when we saw snr .. that's how it should be
The size difference was definitely noticeable
Ben looks like he's less weight but held his own ate every punch chris remained clear and precise and stayed solid throughout. Deserves a draw really
Unbelievable Fight.  Barry Hearn was right when he said to Eddie this is the best fight he’s ever put on
This fight 100x better than ufc rn
Ben won, i dont know how this was given to Eubanks jr, this was and has been a rip off
This fight was a movie
These may bw highlights but howd he win
Warriors
Explosif 🧨
Proper scrap
3:01 That moment
Fair play lads. That’s how you do it.
Eubank showing his class tonight, cut from a superior cloth! Handled everything that’s been thrown at him very well, always very calm and honourable, unlike Conor. Well done eubank you deserved that win 👌
That was BRUTAL hands down to the both fighters !
Uebank all day everyday let's gooooo
It looked like Conor was more active but still a great fight
Conor benn has best moments also. Thats right hand is devastating
Both fighter came out elevated from this!
One of the best fights ever.
Connor Binn was giving him work though for the smaller man.
What a fight, no technicals just pure warriors, this is how boxing should be.
Not gonna lie that ref was annoying me but what a fight regardless, went exactly how the first fight with the seniors went
So Eubank Jr is excited about beating a man 2 weight classes beneath him, and was almost KO’d but that guy😂😂😂😂
you'd think this was a conor benn masterclass from these highlights 🤣
Now that was a fight ❤
WOW THAT WAS CRAZY!!
Absolute brilliant fight. Can i ask everyone. Considering the difference in weight divisions they had to change and age/experience. If that was a consideration in the total outcome does anyone think benn deserved the win? Just a "IF" question
Wow. What a fight. Another British classic has lived up to the expectation. Congrats to both these gladitors/warriors and hats off to both the families for all their sacrifices 🙏.
I got so hype because the first person he thanked wwas the first words out of his mouth. He has Great faith and a great dad.
A pyrrhic victory.
YES so glad the sport of boxing is exciting again
Did they touch gloves at the beginning
That was two warriors going at it,
Just saw highlights; Eubanks looks at least 20lbs heavier than Benn.  I know it's a middle weight, but big difference in size of fighters
One of the best fights !!!!! My respect for both boxers!!!
Dunno why Eubank was celebrating, he should be embarrassed that he got took the distance by a much smaller guy. Benn lost the match but he won the duel just by still being there at the final bell. Eubank is lucky he's that much bigger or he wouldn't have stood a chance 🤷‍♂️
Awesome fight...well, more like a war. They gave it their all in every round. Just insane fight.
Someone should tell conn benn it’s not just speed it’s speed and precision he need to calm down and snipe
Conor  won 3 rounds
Robery
Honor to Conor
Experience played a big part here
If Chris hadn't landed so many punches in the end, Conor Benn would have won
Great fight!
Bigger man always win.
Old man Eubanks jr v steroids Benn was entertaining
What a knock that was
I thought Conner won but was a excellent fight
this sport is brutal but yet performances with stories like this one makes it so beautiful.
Rematch
It was a great fight except for the result it was rig😂😂😂
Amazing
Enjoyed this fight Chris showed a ton of grit, he wasn’t taking any chances taking any round off when he clearly was tired. 🥊 🏆
Who tf does the ref think he is
I watch the whole fight. I thought either Benn won or a draw. But Eubanks was changing his gamplane mid fight
That fight got me thinking at 35 years old and never boxed in my entire life maybe this is my time 🤣 🤔
Top men
I honestly think boots can easily beat Conor Benn. He kept throwing that right all night
Fight of the year. I thought it was a draw, but I respect Benn for going up two weight classes to fight a much bigger fighter.
A contender for the FIGHT OF THE YEAR 2025
Are they in the same weight class? He looks twice the dudes size, what's this?
Great fight, an absolute British Classic but some of the most BIASED commentary, I have ever heard from the three stooges.
BENN JR. WON THAT FIGHT.... EUBANK JR . RABBIT PUNCHING BACK OF THE HEAD ALL THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT BAD REFEREEE.....BENN JR . LEFT EUBANK JR. LOOKING LIKE THE ELEPHANT MAN AT THE END OF THE FIGHT AND HARDLY A SCRATCH ON HIM . BIGGEST ROBBERY IN BOXING EVER
These 2 put it all on the line. Such an amazing fight and arguably can be seen as the best fight of the decade so far. Can’t wait to see the rematch
The right winner 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Extra weight is extra cardio. 10 pounds from welterweight to middle weight is a lot.   Eubank used his weight clever and gassed Benn out with pressure. Eubank took a lot of risk tho, but it worked out. Still Benn was very dangerous at times.   Looked like there was room for Eubank to stay on the outside behind jab and lead hook to follow up with the right hand more often. The times he used the right hand Benn felt them.   But that is just YT pseudo-analyst gibberish. Glad they fought like warrior gladiators, leaving it all in the ring.   These men gifted us a classic and exceeded anyone’s expectations. The whole event was magnificent btw. A memorable night of boxing.   Much respect ❤
Did Eddie put these highlights together? Totally missing out every round Conor lost. Embarrassing
middleweight fought a welterweight - huge respect to Benn. Great fight, lived up to the hype and did their dads proud
This lose hurt so bad for Benn, Just look at his face. It looks liked his power was not enough to hurt. Eubank and Eubank started looking like the bigger fighter in the end! People got there money worth tonight!
😂conor benn💩
benn is a little ball of basstid  he did well
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Now from what I saw from the replay I can't call it a *unanimous*
What a firecracker! Both men left it all in the ring! 🥊🥊🥊🥊
I don't like both their character but the fight is awesome. Their father's legacies are being elevated to the next level😊
It look like Benn won to me idk or it could of been a tie
BRO THE ENERGY THIS FIGHT HAD WAS JUST DIFFERENT 🔥 THAT WAS LEGENDARY ‼️
Connor Benn deserves big respect after this!!! Very impressed by his performance👏🏿
None are on  canelo's level for sure
He did it for all the Eggs falsely accused over the years! Truly a legendary outcome! 😂👌
I see a trilogy between these 2 guys....
Oh
I had it 117-111 for Eubank jr. The right man won
I wanted to stick my hands in a bucket of ice after watching this. At least one of them fractured their hands during this fight without realizing it from the adrenaline rush.
Well at least that's over, back to top quality boxing now.
What a war! They did the best they could. I'm really glad I was able to watch it.
Congrats Chris from America!!!!🎉🥊💯
Unanimous??????
Benn won 🏆 to me
Great fight, great determination from Eubank
Great fight
Procedure was Palementary!!!!
You can tell Eubank used to be trained by Roy
amazing fight!!
conor ben vs enis kay conor ben ako pag nag laban sila
They need to fire this garbage referee and never hire him again ever for a fight. This dmbfck thought the show was about himself, using any little thing to break the fight and talk on camera.
0:40
Shove that up ya Hearn
That thumbnail is mad
Should of been a draw!
Jnr looked a little slow, the weight drain probably.
HOW IS THAT A UNANIMOUS DECISION?? I SAW CONOR GET THE BETTER OF EUBANK!
Benn such a fool 😂
It was a great fight.  I want to see a rematch.  Thank you Turki Al-Sheikh!
Thank you to these two great champions. They rekindled the flame of real boxing. A fight between warriors. For me, it's a draw for both of them. They gave it all.😎
Ik they daddy's proud
Rematch parihasvlng timbang sana tutulog yan si uebank grv laki nya muntik pa matalo❤
Eubank Jr is some fighter. Fighting at 35 he gave away every possible advantage including the rehydration clause added yet he still had career best performance
Absolutely brilliant fight but no way it was 116-112!
1 of the best boxing fights today. they gave boxing fans what they wanted👍 this fight made all Floyd M. fight a comedy😀
Now that is a boxing match and a fair fight i belive.  Eubank jnr turned it up at the end which i feel won him the fight.  Well done boys, well done.  This is boxing and they both left it all in the ring.
Hey a slug fest those Brit’s are tough cats !
I hate listening to these biased English commentators
"NO AHH AHH NO AHHHHH"
*Offside!*
Great fight.
I understand he out landed benn, but I saw benn landing the cleaner, more powerful shots , I believe it was like 3 times where he stunned Eubanks, Eubanks had his in the later rounds but benn took his shots very well it was more of fatigue at the end where the shots seem to be doin something, Eubanks left w a broken jaw as well, so idk to me I would’ve marked this as a draw 116-112 is ridiculous in my opinion
Why is this highlight showing Benn won? Chris is a lot bigger than Benn. If they were the same size, Chris would get KOed
Draw...bank was lucky benn had the drop 6th round bank boy held into him for dear life😂😂😂
Wow wow wow, my goodness Benn was a beast in the ring, wasn’t expecting that. Congrats to Eubank also!
Conor looks slow at middle weight division he should move down weight
Was this a catchweight contest? These two should never have been in the same ring
👍🏻
I can’t ignore how much bigger Eubank Jr is. Benn showed some cojones
What a fight
Lived up to the name
Why was thisEdited to make conor look way better than he was lol the last 12 rounds Eubank took conor ben to the rope and beat him at his own game while take a few shots of course.. but you wouldnt think so with thios video
It didn't look. Like a walk in the park. On a nice summers day
Amazing fight 🥊 their dads produced  big hearts ❤️💪🏽🥊🫶🏽🙏🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TWO WARRIORS...they gave it their all and what ana amazing fight!
Amazing fight
Maybe I am bias but I just watched skysports highlights and dazn feels more like the fight I watched. Don't have a fav out of the 2 but dazn was watching same fight as me....skysports focused on the few shots eubank landed (which were shrugged off by the smaller man btw) I thought benn did great and f*ck me does he have a heart and chin...I'm shocked nobody went down. Mad respect, this fight  goes into modern classic category for sure, it's up there with Aj vs klitcho
What a fight, the hype was worth it 👏🏿
Really enjoyed the parliamentary proceedings tonight.
That was a battle
Love watching that flog Conor Ben lose
This is real boxing, not boring
😂😂😂 instant classic? These DAZN people be so thirsty nowadays.
Must be win a fight of the year
What baffles me even more is that these guys pretty much sprinted 12 rounds. None of them really took a round off which is absolutely mental and no knockdowns were shared. Warriors
What A Fight!!
Cheater never prosper.
Ben won
These highlights made it look like a rob on the win
Clearly Chris was affected quite badly after a few rounds by all the steaming weight off twice.
Eubank JR is Waaaaaay too big for Benn. This fight never should have happened.
Parliamentary!
Eubank a C Level fighter. He will get crushed by a C level middle weight. He is a joke.
Utmost respect to both men. Absolutely both of them gave it 100%. Made for a great fight. The boys  doing it again would not be out of the question, look at them both at the end they both look like they were in a f****** car accident. They beat the f*** out of each other, the fight they had inside the ring lived up 2  all the hype. Can't ask for anything more this was great for boxing 👊💯☝️
We need one more, what a fight 🔥
These Jr can now proudly carry their father's legacy. They solidified their own legacies tonight.
Cracking fight... Surprised Benn didn't get scrambled!!
BTW, skysports beat u to it with the highlights but yours are better.  I think benn would have finished it with his left hook/uppercut. It was open all night. Actually though benn took it and I was shocked with the score, judges forgot the first 6 rounds I guess
All the drama and mind games and the winner are the Eubank family.
Like fathers like sons....great  fight ....great Britain 🇬🇧
A REMINDER FROM EVERYONE, CHEATERS NEVER WIN. Very happy for Eubank. Glad the cheater Benn lost. Another L for Hearn 😂
Conor fight like his dad i love it
This fight was close not the landslide 8-4 in favor of Chris this fight should have been split decision or draw
Benn was robbed draw all day long corrupt judges no wonder fans don’t wana watch it anymore 🤷
I thing Ben was robbed
Conor lost but he won his respect back
Legendary Fight, bring on the rematch!
Fight of The year was Agit Kabayel Vs Zhang 👌Thank My later
Did that referee seriously force them to touch gloves??  That's not your territory as a ref   Only time I've seen this go on is in boxing. I don't ever see that happen in Mma   A ref once deducted a point from a fighter for refusing to touch gloves one time.   These refs need to be put in line  Your job is to control the fight. Not to be a heart surgeon and try to fix men's hearts
When anyone can, watch the full fight instead. It was an absolute modern war that I'm certain will be remembered as a classic one day
Great fight could have easily been a draw but for me Benn was just edged it. Either way what a great fight what a great display for the sport of boxing as a whole. 👏👌
Above and beyond my expectations from both men. Lived up to the hype and then some. I had it even after 10, with Eubank Jr. winng the championship rounds. He was clearly gassed, and legs were gone late but just kept throwing combinations and landing. His ability to slip punches throughout was also a key factor. Looking forward to the rematch.
Should’ve been a draw
Action packed and entertaining. Eubank Jr showed a lot of heart but looked shaky after getting caught a few times. At 35, with his punch resistance diminishing he should retire.
Chris fought with heart man.
Unbelievable fight
This dude really celebrated going life and death with a welterweight
What a fight
Was this fight clean? I don't think so. Ben kept the pressure on and then shook the eubank a few times. A close win for Ben I think.
Connor Benn got my respect
Great fight
What a fight. Both guys having their moments. No knockdowns. But a fight of the night candidate. Must have a part 2.
Now their mothers have to fight next
I got to admit it.....This fight absolutely lived up to its reputation!!!
Super chris!!!!💪🏾🥊💪🏾
the best fight salute to conor Benn he's small but he can fight toe to toe by eubank what a fighttttt
@1:58: Eubank comes in with a straight left. Benn responds with a vicious right hook. Eubank grabs the back of Benn's head and tries to land a fight-ending uppercut. Benn shifts left and hits Eubank with a left instead. That's an incredible two second sequence.  Would love to see a frame-by-frame scoring of this fight.
Them 2 went at it! This fight was right there with Davis vs Roach!
Benn never changes his style.
Fight of the decade!!
Rematch??
Like I guessed it this guys weighing over 180 at least
Lok that disgusting father figure😮..
Connor benn did really welll
Conor was first but too predictable that upper cut was easy to find for Jr just as the left hook was for Conor. Rematch perhaps?
They both made their dad proud. Britian today should be proud
Sick fight
Eubank threw over 900 punches 😮 anybody thinks he didn't win the fight is deluded, the older and weight drained man schooled the drug cheat!
EUBANK EUBANK
I feel like Eubanks dad been in corner brought out a different warrior inside him well deserved what a fighter too do that in last 2 rounds with hardly any energy humbled benn differently
CLASSIC!!!!
Bomac really help this man out
Now thats why i love boxing💯 both men are warriors 🔥🔥 great fight
No juice no power 😂
Woke up at 2 in the morning to watch the whole card because every fight caught my eye starting from CBS vs Glanton and was sleepy throughout the entire card. Not because it was boring but because I had like 4h of sleep and Eubank vs Benn woke me up, and happy. 5/5 on my bets and parley.
Takumura vs hawk style
Never a unanimous decision...A rematch is certainly on the cards...
Commentary was 100% On Conor Benns cheeks this whole fight.
Great fight from both men. Glad to see Eubank win 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Much respect to both fighters... should hv been a draw... and we don't want any rematch, both men already fought their hearts out 🎉🎉
Perhaps Eubank Sr getting out of his seat to attend the corner of Jr made a slight difference, showing up to the fight more so, against all odds he up held the family name.
How is this the same weight class?
2 lads went at it. Fair play to both men great fight
Benn did great despite being the smaller guy. Ate everything Eubank hit em with as if they were the same size. Great fight !
Would love to see Connor go back down to 147 and challenge boots
I dont wanna hear anymore that Eubank won. Such a shame talking this way after his absolute destroyed face which tells for itself. Absolute brillaint fight, but Benn deserved the V much more
I guess Connor Benn would won this fight two years ago if u know u know😂. But i really respect Connor Benn for his Performance
Well done jr 🎉
100 per cert Eddie Hearn we need a re match 💰💰💰💰👎
Small bean
What a fight 👏
Looks like Connor Benn, Jr. won that fight.
Conor Benn looking like Randy Orton.  Benn should be fighting Harlem Eubank not Chris.
So much better highlights than on the Matchroom channel, what a fight
Eubank Jr fought very smart. He played him down like Roy Jones did it in the past. I saw the Roy Jones signature during the fight.
We need to run it back!!!
Sky commentary was bias for benn. 8-4 116-112 to eubank was fair. I hope they don't rematch unless there's no weight restriction malarkey
Wow
Can’t wait for the rematch
It looks like Conor did more damage but that doesn’t win fights
What a Fight!!! Chris im so proud of you! Big Boxer big Heart, you are real Tiger like your Father!
Benn swung harder, but Eubank landed more and cleaner. I think the score is accurate
Anything for money
AMAZING FIGHT !!!!!!!!!
Woa spooky spaghetti 😮,  this was wicked sorcery 🙌🏿 🏆
They fought like lions
🔥👑🐐
When you get lost in this type of battle, you are still considered a winner 🏆.
Benn looked like an overcooked omelette.  Did he train back in Spain or in a tanning bed?
What a fight I can't believe I'm old enough to have lived through there fathers epic rivalry and seeing there sons carry that on and give us another classic.
This is actually a leaneag battle that will never end. The feud of these families has just begun in my opinion.
Benn proved me wrong as he was better and stronger than I expected. Still, well done Chris..
well done young eubank
Benn was robbed
Made their father proud.
Бен выиграл этот бой.
If that last round had another 30 seconds Cb was getting KO’d.
about time boxing got entertaining
Youncan easliy tell weogjt dofrence in power
Canrlo will.murk both of these guys
The commentary was outrageous. Shameful levels of biased. Glad your guy got battered.
Come on.... Different weights ... Goodness me! Benn put on a great show!!!
Don’t think Conor ate enough eggs
Legacy fight ❤
So happy Eubank won.
BENN IS THE superior fighter...... Eubank is the stronger man ...... was a complete mismatch unfortunately
First time ever cheering for Eubank 😁
Should be SPLIT decision .. either one of each can win ..
I have never wanted a fighter to win as much as I did eubank tonight. Eubank deserved tonight's win in every way, shape or form. Well done chris
wow what a fight
The last 2 rounds won the fight for JR.. He showed how much of a dog he is... Benn Deserves a rematch tho
What were the scores?
as an mma fan myself i must say this was one of the rare boxing fights where i was truly loving it .... what a fking fight i love when both fighters"try to win" and dont just play it as safe as possible .
Great fight, Right decision.
Felt for Connor when they announced the decision. His whole life flashed before him, but it wasn't the way he imagined it. Heartbreaking!
Rematch!!! Great fight ! But i think connor deserve rematch
I hope Benn doesn’t take a long layoff, he still can be a part of big fights after this A.S.A.P
Correct result but not by the margin was closer
Not a fan of Benn, rather the opposite and I thought I’d be happy to see him lose, but he really gave it his all and earned my respect as a boxing fan
Great fight! I think Eubank was a bit slower due to the weight but he showed heart ❤
Gorgeous fight..🎉🎉 we need another fight of this.
Theyve dubbed the crowd cheering at the announcement but most were booing
🔥
116-112 How Much Did He Get Paid
This is why you shouldn’t cheat. Karma
Benn 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Connor benn got humbled
I gained a lot of respect for Conor Benn
Red fights like Roy Jones Jr.
Now this is what boxing used to be like 😲 Two warriors wanting to rip each other's heads off 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 A rematch is not necessary, its too dangerous for both fighters 🙅🏽‍♂️
Awesome Fight 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
sorry but 116-112 all cards is utter bolloxs. Rematch plz.
Can’t hate either fighter I had Ben to win, both showed so much class and brought it back to the 80s where boxing what just about boxing, big ups to Eubanks you took some heavy heavy shots and kept coming, Conor can hold his head high he did his dad proud no matter.
This was a weight drained Eubanks Jr. and he still got the job done.
Benn was a beast! Need part 2
Conor Benn is a tank
Boxing won tonight,what a fight,what a rivalry,what a show,and what a show of heart,grit,and determination from both fighters, this fight is up there among the greats of the sport,big up to both champs and Eubank Jnr and Senior for coming back together after a long time👏👏👏Rastafarai
waiting for the third generation fight.
Savvy marketing strategy from DAZN putting this out so quickly! REMATCH!
Speed 2:35
Look how big differace from jake Paul etc.....
Warriors, Spartans, Gladitors, .❤ from Sierra Leone 🇸🇱🇸🇱🥊🥊🥊.🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱
Talk about an ageing fight, back to the hands of stone days. 💥🥊 3 families at the heart of British boxing 🙌
Only 3 minutes? Man Turki gonna have full fight on Monday 😂
Wow❤
None of them are ready for a Mexican Fighter !
FOY so far and I hope when they run it back Jr gets that rehydration clause nicked outta there
Fight of the year
These guys are both warriors props to both guys.  Savages. In the Vikings days they both would be earls for sure but looking for the throne of king.
The whole event was a great spectacle and show and the fight lived up to the hype. If there are no more big money fights for Jr, he may want to think about hanging it up
Definitely ‘Fatal Fury’ on display! Well done Chris and Conner.
Man, I have full on respect for Conor now. Amazing fight!
Ben is too wild where’s the jab to set up punches where’s the coach ?
I love when fights live up to the hype
Eubank has a weak punch
Great fight has to be a contender for fight of the year both men hurt a rematch will be awesome
I'd watch that again! Deserves a rematch just because it should definitely happen!
Waiting for next generation from this family
Eubank looks way bigger
What a fight!💪🏻👊🏻👏🏻
Pulling them back for not touching gloves ffs 🤦‍♂️
The ecstasy and the eggstacy.
Benn is like 90's techno it was better on drugs
No 2nd fight.  Benn was clearly just not big enough.
Dont worry guys , conor benn will take the L like a champ , he aint no devin haney 🔥 🎤
もっかいやってもいい
Great fight. Congrats Chris.
Great fight Not sure about the decision
Eubank vs Benn in a thrilling, dramatic fight where Eubank manages to take it? What year is it again?
This was stupendous
Wow, what a brutal fight, EUBANK deserves it!!!!
Draw
Benn drained himself opening rounds left with nothing in the tank!
We all got our money's worth... 💯
The 12th round had me shadow boxing in my living room😂😂😂
Otro robo..
Fantastic fight
Legendary
Lived up to hype. Bravo to both
You see why Hearn and Benn needed the weight clauses. Great fight though!!
This highlight is so biased😂😂
These highlights seemed to be biased because the guy that won looks like he lost with this footage
Both were great really great fight
The size difference was noticeable!!! Conor Benn is a G!!! He basically fought a Light Heavyweight tonight!!! Forget about the rematch and come back down to @47! You have Barrios and Boots in the division
I knew Chris Eubank Jr could pull it off, respect to both fighter's they're warriors but the right man won
This was benn fight, eubank face shows it all benn was robbed
Eubank misses weight and is naturally the bigger guy.. not too much to be priud about he beat a smaller guy
The highlights are a bit biased  They fight was much closer
Poor humtydumpty
Thank you Eubank for giving everything ,  true warrior.
This was childs' play.
I don't like it when refs try to make fighters touch gloves
Only 60%…….
Great fight ,  i rhought that eubank jr would win in 6 round , man benn proved me wrong , he is a warrior. I look forward into the rematch !
Eubank's legs weren't there because of the scummy 10lb rehydration clause which Matchroom and Team Benn put on Eubank.
Eubank Jr the clear winner 👊🏾💪🏾  this was a legendary scrap 🔥
Criminal record 😮😮
Best fight ive ever watched
What an Eggcellent performance 🥚 🍳
Eddie had all fight conditions in Benn favour Ring, Weight, but he forgot to give him the juice. See what happens to fighters who don't get their fix they lose.
That was an eggcellent fight
This was a Hollywood script come guys! What a fight!
Creed vs Drago ahh fight🔥🔥
Mma is dead
That was a draw, at best…if not a Benn win.
If Eubank can win while being completely dehydrated, make this fight without a rehydration clause and it’s a whole different fight.
Imagine weight draining your opponent and still losing. Benn should move back down to 147. Eubank should try to get a big fight at 168. No need for a rematch or another dangerous weight cut.
A draw from what I can see
Eubankjr grinded out an arduous points decision against a blown up welterweight.Seriously is eubank fighting Canelo next? hahah.Canelo smashes eubank up,easy work.Thats if he wants the fight which i doubt
Benn lose to eubanks again
All that i smash you his old well you lost to old man cheat
Idc fight of the year
easy fight to score yall in denial benn won at least 4 rounds don’t let the horrible commentators get to you
The thumbnail 💀
That was a robbery
What a spectacle. Absolutely amazing fight! Thank you both men for your efforts. Amazing!
Why do referees sometimes INSIST on that glove touch?  This is a boxing match; not a gift giving contest.
Great fight both did their families proud 👏
What a fight, was rooting for Eubank since the fight was postponed the first time. It lived up to the expectations, even after all the advantages Benn had he still ended up losing. Made it even more sweet knowing Eddie Hearn was probably fuming when he heard the score cards 😂.
hate when the refs force them to touch gloves at the start
Great great fight.
Where’s the 1mill Eddie?? Haha
3mins of highlights is a disservice
Chris told him 2 years ago.. "I'm gonna be 60% but thats going to be enough for me to have my way with you."  Guess what happened... he was 60% and still won.. he looked fatigued the entire match.. Benn can't beat Devin Haney, Garcia, Teo, you name em..
115-113 for Eubank. Great fight.
BREAKING NEWS Home Alone has been voted the best film ever
Clear win for Eubank. No need for a rematch. Let them move on.
The uppercut was the money punch for Jr.
Both men gave it their all for their father's legacy. Much respect to both of them .  What a story ! What a promotion !! What a fight !!!
I can't wait to turki to post the full fight i want to watch it again ❤
Both men showed who they both are. They are warriors, they are kings! They are legends 🔥
Hearn clearly has no say in the thumbnails 😂
Amazing for releasing this so quick
All boxing fans are happy that cheat got beat.  Eubank showed so much heart, he was so tired but kept throwing.
Youtube must be the best invention ever you do not have to watch live when its free to watch within minutes of  being on
Imagine if he wasn't weight drained .. cause he still weighed in this morning again
Eubank deserved this victory and the British people gotta appreciate him at this point. He is globally appreciated. They're going to make a movie and TV series about this 35 year buildup and history some day.
🔥🔥
benn just dont got the ko power at 160, in the rematch jr can definitely tko benn if he picks his shots better
The procedure was indeed parliamentary.
116-112 a bit harsh but some fight
DAZN being quick with it, everyone could appreciate this. Cheers!
An absolute war. Both men have true warrior spirits. So much praise for Eubank: having to lose all that weight; rehydration clauses; emotional trauma with his old man and so forth, yet he still gets the job done 👏👏👏
Eubank name will always reign supreme to the Benn name.
fight of the year so far🥊
Fight of the year
Fight of the year?
What a fight what a build up
What a fight
Cheers for releasing this so quick DAZN.
