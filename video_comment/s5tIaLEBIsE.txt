Just a reminder the Dogs havent won a finals game since 2016... you're welcome.
One of the best games ever, absolutely beautiful
Was one of the best games I'd seen in a while
You hear that? It’s the sound of Ethan Bullemor thunderstorm
Bulldog elminaml
Team  bulldogs 👇
Woohoo 🎉😅
What a play from scrum. This will go along way in the next decade. I was watching the play live , my mind was blown away. I was like, no waaaaaayy 😮
Garcia Sarah Harris Maria Williams Jennifer
DCE Try from the scrum wow!
refs are killing the game with BAD calls , head high across the face and NO 10 min sin bin , got to do better . . .
Glad manly won
REED WON IT FOR MANLY 😂😂😂THE DOG SHOT STARTED THAT ROLL ON THANKS BRO.💯🦅
If that was a try by Burton I give up.
Happy dogs lost. What a shame especially to that tiny little creature player that so arrogant. Dogs were very aggressive and provoking manly players to be nasty but manly players were professional and just kept playing. Well hahah karma hits hard and manly deserves to win. Blue flags and drums went missing after the game, c’mon dogs bring some noise and show manly fans your blue flags waving 😅😅😅😅😅.
I Iove when Kiks runs like big Willie
See how great games are when there’s hardly any 6 again sets
Manly gonna get pumped next week anyway
what a game
Like that one Crichton? Haha 😂 what happens when you get cocky haha 😂
John's comment "Turbos gone". even later Turbo set up a beautiful try. "Turbo gone up a notch" more like it. even injured.
2nd manly try was a huge forward pass
❤❤❤
Back to the kernel you dogs
Funny all the comments on insta bagging the ref for giving eagles the game, yet i swear the game i watch the doggies were lying on the ground acting hurt and milking soft penalties off said ref.
Manly and ref vs the bulldogs
That bullumor try was a bloody knock on and forward wtffff
ya dont win the comp in July…
Like Billy would be able to kickau anyway lol😂
That’s probably the greatest win from manly I’ve ever seen since the 2013 pre lim win against the rabbits! Had no right to win that but showed heart all the way to the end!
Not a sea eagles fan , but Dce try was the highlight 🍻
So no more celebration in Belmore😂😂😂
I really hate to criticise players.... but Mahoney 😂... he gave away penalties that led to two tries... kicked the ball that gave another thirty metres... passed the ball to the non field goal kicker when they needed a two pointer... BUT... he was playing good dummy-half football, even passing the ball quiclky and in front of the player to get the momentum moving.... but he really did cruel it for them with stupid 'metre losing' decisions.  Manly"s first try was (AGAIN NRL) off a foward pass.
3 m forward pass,,manly try,with REF on the spot  Guess Manly need to look at their salary cap,noa Refs are on the payroll
Sportsbet rigging games
Sportsbet wanted dogs to lose so much money on the dogs to win and make grand final
Manly didn't win that the Dogs lost it.  Lack of experience in the big moments, silly penalties and drop balls and they killed themselves.  Bring on 25.
womp womp
Don’t worry trust me next season is ours
How is no one talking about koula scoring the game winning try by himself
There is nothing better than seeing the bulldogs loose in front of their supporters.!!! Ring a ding ding 😂🤣
Tries from manly were pure class. Well deserved win.
Bulldogs fans deserve this one
What a try from DCE off the scrum!
Good win by manly. But it all come to an end next week. Sorry not sorry lol
Gus’s brand new shiny team couldn’t get the job done. Well done Luke brooks for playing his first finals game in 11 years.
Reed mahoneys ill discipline cost the dogs imo. 3 indiscretions lead to tries for manly. He got to fix that up next year.
Up the 🦅🦅🦅
As a Doggy supporter this hurts,but being positive this been a great year considering the team only been form this year,can't wait to see what next year bring after these guys already been playing together for a year. We really missed Kurt Mann no doubt,credit to Manly they hang in there in a tight game like how we like to play. Turbo was playing with half a body  . DCE was brilliant his experience & leadership carry Manly to the win today in my eyes,that's something I think Reed Mahoney can learn from,you don't have to be a niggling player in a big game situation like today, his got plenty of skills and can be the games  best hooker if he set his mind to it.
Not even a dogs supporter but they got robbed the refs are blind
Bulldogs just kept inviting them back in
Up the sea eagles!!! stadium went silent at full time 🤫
Dogs played extremely well considering this is their first finals in 8 years with little to no experience and only playing together for 1 season  Bulldogs forever we move on to next year
Just goes to show you can be dominant for most of the game but lose those key moments and it won’t matter in the end
Don't cry doggies
There are only two words left.  Go Manly
Manly second was forward by about 2 meters.
The fox had to get on it early couldnt wait🙄
I was there live I cried when I saw Kiraz on the floor
manly won off a forward pass lmao
Hoppers pass 2 meters forward! Ref right there. Unbelievable
Ya Right Jonsy,some plays way Out of This World, wha a treat ,bloody beauties
Skelton is the biggest dud
Penrith fan and hate bulldogs. This is awesome 😂😂..any streets closed today😂😂
If the Fox was playing he would've got the Doggies over the line😏
Seibold revenge on Bronco’s, Manly still in it to win it 😂.
Hope the muppet that you could hear on channel 9’s coverage of the game continuously yelling out foul language enjoyed the last 7 minutes.
Brilliant game,but hurts as wanted both Teams to win,so many fab players I Love,crikey ayye,they give  me so much joy
Mighty game, Thank You players and Ref's,love yous all,as great man sed
Crichton staying down after a great tackle, and we get penalized,  well that didn't work mate. See ya next year doggies...lol.
The Doggies should've taken Addo Carr's lead for a little extra pep and it mightve gotten them over the line 😂
Stephen Crichton is so overrated
I’m no manly fan, but that cherry evans try from the scrum was rugby league art
chin up doggies you play tough and fought to the death... considering what that flop druggo addo carr put the team through you guys played great.
Manly showed today that they can play tough physical football..Dogs turned up to play semi-final football,  and nothing in it. That's what fans want to see..
I GOT 4 OUT 4  IN THIS FINALS TIPPING. ✅✅✅✅
The Temu Panthers blew it Big-time !!
DCE should have been in the bin! And manly were always offside! Refs should all be sacked
referee was a pathetic joke,    no more footy until we get better referees, bullymore try was a travesty
Dogs played with heart, Manly won with skill
as a bulldogs fan , yes it does hurt . But so proud of all they achieved this year . And it is great to see Turbo on the field , I am a huge fan .
So biased commentary
Bout time the game goes our way. That's what happens when you aren't grubby and play fair. Manly deserved the win by far. That tommy talau "late shot" was an absolute joke. What has the NRL gotten to?
lehi hopoate forward pass to Ethan bullemor try dogs robbed.
All manly cars,buses go through belmore and keep beeping the car horns all the way back to the Northern beaches.
Canterbury Panthers 😂😂😂😂😂
Congrats to all teams 👏 in the finals and remaining teams 🎉🎉❤
go manly we’ve done it again 🎉🎉🎉
Well deserve win Manly come from behind 👏 congrats
How good was it to see brooks and DCE combined to split the two biggest grubs in the game the 9-4 from the dogs lol 😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😆
Storms are winning the GF anyway, long neck cheryl Evans says he gets the last laugh.. bahahahah. Yeah nah. I do.
Thank you Reed Mahony
Bye bye doggies
Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs neutered
gonna be a rough night in canterbury haha up the sea eagles...
Seriously which Daley is better 1,6 or 7 🤷‍♂️
I sure hope someone uploads the entire game 😮😅they never gave up, the most tense and nervous eighty minutes I've experienced in a looooong time, to all the training staff, the coach, the playing group, the fans, thankyou 🙏💖😁  Bulldogs, you would've gone into the sheds at half-time against any team in the competition today, you provided us with invaluable lessons in resolve and determination and dedication and commitment.  Plenty of folks hate Manly, but consider the NRL without us, we've earned our keep today.
Bulldog fans are proof that evolution can go in reverse.
The streets of Bankstown, Belmore, Greenacre, Canterbury will all be safe tonight, expect no riots or drums being played in the streets, Channel 9 News can confirm all supporters of other clubs can return home safe until March 1 2025.  Thank you for your cooperation.  Also congrats to the Dogs for playing one extra game this year, normal procedures can now commence.
Gutsy effort by the Bulldogs, but experience and good decision making got manly over the line at the end. If Turbo was 💯 fit today manly win easy. I hope the Bulldogs learn from this loss. Thanks for a great season. Up the mighty Bulldogs. !
Lucky the bunker turned a blind eye to a obvious knock on which led to a try from a forward pass. It doesn’t matter who won. Won’t go much further anyways
Hah hah hah doggies ,and reed you can stick it where the sun does not shine! Oh and by the way you can blame me for the loss because I turned the game of with 15 minutes to go hence the manly win.
Manly suck
First try by Manly was forward. Refs are blind and sea eagles aren't deserving. Game is rigged.
GO MANLY !!!! MANLY FOREVER !!!!
Wah, wah wah, Gould and his grubs.
Rip Bulldogs, and that 10 year trend
To all the bulldogs fans hahahahaha ohhh GO MANLY !
Sucked in Bulldogs!!!!!!!
Hahahahaha “dogs of war” hahahahaha
WOW
Tolutau 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Manly won’t win. It’s between Melbourne and Penrith.
How good is Andrew Johns.probably one of the best commentators in nrl history 🤗👌
Bulldogs are duds 💀💀💀💀
Can Manly beat Roosters and then Storm to make it to the GF?
🦅My Team ❤
What a gutsy win
Well done Manly, but I gotta say, Dogs should have won that. Shame Addo-Carr wasn't there might have made all the difference
tommy talau getting penalised for that late shot was a joke..
Look out Coffs Harbour 😆
Biggest forward pass manly 2nd
Panthers B's were a little unfortunate at the end
Nothing against bulldogs they dominated Manley the whole game but anyone else love seeing Crichton loose?
Bulldogs pretender 😂 sack Gus and Ciraldo hopeless
billy slater is a flog. cant stand listening to the bloke. good on ya manly!
Hate both teams but hate Bulldogs more. Well done Sea Eagles. Those Bulldogs fans not so cocky tonight. Reed Mahoney needs to focus on playing rather than niggling.
The Bullimore try pass was 1.5m forward. Didn't even raise a mention by the commentary team that was obviously riding Manly.
GO MANLY!!!!  a well deserved win, the Dogs played well, they're made us earn the win
Crichton must feel like a real loser ,absolutely beautiful
Rest in peace to all the Hectics who put their house on the Bullflogs 😂
Cant wait till the videos of all the Arab Doggies supporters causing a scene outside the stadium lmao. Biggest sore losers
Fan of neither team.. why didn’t DCE get penalised for dragging the player down after that Mahoney hit? Tough call with that haumolo contest too.
Robbed by the ref's and I ain't even a doggies fan
My team has made the 8 and won the first week's games. However I've only watched 15 minutes worth of football this weekend. Hands down the most boring start to finalise in the history of the NRL.
daylight robbery
That was one of the best games I’ve ever seen
Let’s go manly, let’s go manly, we did it boys
Stephen Crichton giving the best bloke in the game Jurbo a massive gob full for no reason and then Manly immediately scoring the winning try is proof that the footy gods do exist.
Go the Mighty Eagles!
Dog fans really got cocky after that winning streak against bottom 8 sides lmao. Bye bye Bulldogs. Biggest fluke season like Warriors last year haha.
