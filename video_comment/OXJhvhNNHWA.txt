The so called Politics king getting checkmated😅
Ranil met a real journalist for the first time 😂
Too much evil people is holding top position in the world. The world is in a major collapse. Thanks to Medhi for opening the eyes to the world.
Ranil is a goose. Mehdi never enters a room with out facts.
GET HIM MEDHI…yea you old fart, you won’t be controlling the interview at all. Your just along for the ride so shut up until given permission to speak for a strict amount of time
Stupid old man.
As a Bangladeshi and what we went through, this guy is comical 🤣
Imagine AKD here.. 😝
6:43 Bro😂
As a Sri Lankan citizen i found his interview with Mehdi Hassan as an absolute disaster, embarrassment, quite  frankly, embarrassing contrast in professionalism.  Mr. Hassan exemplified as journalist holding power to account with his clear, fact based, and clean questioning.  The former President, however, was not an engagement with the substance of the questions, but a clinic in evasion and irritation.  Any respect I had for his political acumen evaporated during this exchange. It was deeply disappointing to watch, and left me ashamed of that Sri Lankan representation on a global stage. Absolutely ridiculous 😕
Thank you Al jazeera, and the Mr Hassen
People might have positive or negative impression about this interview. But whatever their stance may be, one thing everybody should accept about Mehdi 's intelligence to quickly learn about everything about Sri Lanka to interview a person like this.  RESPECT TO MEHEDI.
Mehdi Hassan is not a professional interviewer. His strategy is always aggravating the speaker. Mundane.
Anti-corruption and anti-nepotism must be fought by every country. Invest in education and social infrastructure heavily. Economy will be reviving already in Sri Lanka, after the Pandemic and the corrosive bankruptcy.
Who’s watching today ?sep 3rd
Srilankan Joker  with reporter 🤔🤔
මිනීමරුවෙක් සමග මොන  සාකච්ඡාද?.
රටේ උගත් බුද්ධිමත් දරුවන් දස දහස් ගණනක් වදයට ලක් කලේ හිටිලර් කෙනෙක් විදියටයි. බටලන්දෙ වදකය නමින් සුප්‍රසිද්ධ රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ මහා භාණ්ඩාගාරය ශුද්ධ කරපු හොරෙක් දූෂිතයෙක් වංචනිකයක් කොමිස් කාක්කෙක් මිනීමරුවෙක් බව රහසක් නොවෙයි.

Mr Hassan ❤ & salute u sir
Shameful!
Al Jazeera pro hamas
Please  invite Namal Rajapaksa next time Mr. Hassan, Sri Lankan people are thanking you for this interview. Respect!
Accusation : You are HIV positive.  Answer : Where is the report?? 😂😂
Not your typical journalist
❣️❣️❣️❣️🫀
I'm heartbroken for Sri Lanka. As an American, I felt extremely proud of their revolution and hoped that things would get better. I had no idea that the poison of communism was going to sneak in and fill the void. Now, Sri Lanka is not only suffering under communism, but now it's in even more debt with the IMF. Screwed multiple ways. Time for another revolt and bring in a balanced government.
Did of these people who talked about war crimes. did you ask these questions from Tamil Tiger Terrorist leader: why is he taking Tamil children's as soldiers?
Ranil Wickramasinghe was a good president he wanted to do good for Sri Lanka. but he do not have enough power on the parliament to take strict actions against corrupted politicians.
War is over 15 years ago. now Tamil people are living in Harmony with piece. Specially Tamil children's are safe.  Tamil children's do not have to join the Tamil Tigers again.
who let this mutt out of the cage. he is a shame on all sri-lankans
Try interviewing a Pakistani General
Ranil is most Cunning politician of lanka..
මම හිට්ලර් වගෙ කොරන්නං වෙද අපෙ හාමුදුරුවනෙ
Ranil sounds like a very ignorant person and I  wonder how he was ever elected as President and Prime minister??? Soooooo stupid alien 👽 👹👺
Hasan isn't such a good interviewer. Stop being so noisy and allowing the interviewee to talk too.   Your character seems rude rather than being formal.
For the first time in Head to Head, i witnessed someone who stood up to Mehdi and his bullying tactics of not even allowing the person to respond well. Kudos to Ranil sir for standing his ground. I may not agree with his politics but he stood his ground. Commendable.
Ponna Ranil Wickremesinghe. mu karapu balu wada walata daduwam dennama oni mekata ponna balli😅
Mr. Ranil  is  speechless in front of him. Mr . Hassan you are great. Thank you
GUILTY
otherderilictions  like batalanda
murder of lasantha , eknaligoda  by the rabid rat GOTA
this crooked swine stole  the central bank  with ravi karunanayke

Journalist....we need in our mother land Sri Lanka ❤
Now, In 2025 Sri Lankans spend comfortable lives ❤
Thank you for bringing to light national issues, nationalism, corruption within the government, and war conflicts, Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka.

Why this guy been invited?

Bias lefty propaganda
Mehdi Hasan is our hero
Dead Ranil 😃😆😆😃😃🤣💩
For the First Time Ranil Smashed -up by Al Jazeera Thanks Mr Mehdi Hasan
JVP & the Tamil Tigers should take the full responsibility  for the crisis in Sri Lanka!

Look, all about planned to blam sri lanka. Respect mr ranil❤
He got arrested 😊
Mehdi Hassan, a big thank you from the people of Sri Lanka for revealing this so called saviour of SL
Oh my God, look at Ranil’s answers for tamil victims? Ok , this guy massacred his own people (youths) in Batalanda detention camp.
Hats off to the gentleman who is interviewing Ranil-Rajapaksa.👌👍
I don’t know why people call it a civil war? There was no civil war in Sri Lanka. It was a terrorism and they were wiped out rightfully for the sake of every Sri Lankan regardless of which god they believe in.   That one Tamil advocate lady said what’s happening in Gaza and what happens in Lanka are very similar. Yes she is right, both are due to terrorist, Hamas and LTTE are terrorist organisations and it’s a widely accepted fact!
The way ranil finishes the conversation 😂
Mehdi Hasan is Very Boring!😂😂😂😂
Al Jazeera and the panel, you fought for Sri Lanka like you were a Sri Lankan. Thank you from Sri Lanka ❤ for these questions that are also in our hearts. Please invite more Sri Lankan leaders in the future. It is a public service to our precious country Sri Lanka.
For the first time, this journalist met a real politician. He is not new to your game M  😂 next time try on some one  else .
Mehdi is no match for the veteran Sri Lankan politician, who was stopped half-way several times, when  answering key questions.   Poor show by Mehdi.
Not to talk about LTTE any tamil support terror must be killed
Ranil is a dog,worm a criminal and murderer
But no one can JUSTIFY what Tamils did for Sinhalese. --They killed a executive president,  --Bombed Secretary of Defence, --Killed Innocent monks in Anuradhapuraya and unarmed civilians In a room full with terrorist Ranil's a HERO
I watched more than ten times your vedio with ranil.respect.
My satisfaction level while watching this interview 📈
Hassan is very disrespectful to speak like that.
The day Mr Ranil met a Journalist... This is what he do.. Innocent people are a joke for him...
Great interview ❤ , respect and thanks Al Jazeera
One side of sri lankans in bankruptcy. Another side of people (tamils), are in a standard position around the world. Tamils won the war just just without doing anything with these people 😂😂
Literally the journalist was a Rhetorician
In Sri Lanka, there was no civilian war. For nearly 30 years, the conflict was between the Sri Lankan government and the terrorist group LTTE.  It was not a war among civilians, nor was it a civil war where citizens fought each other. Instead, it was a government-led fight against terrorism, because the LTTE carried out violent attacks, assassinations, and bombings that harmed thousands of innocent civilians, both Sinhalese and Tamils.  So, it is more accurate to call it a war against terrorism, not a civilian war.
Absolutely beautiful. They deconstructed his lies and corrupt policts to his face in front of a live audience.
35:37 ru, ru ,ru ru ruuru ruu ruu😂 Just centigratez vibe 😂
I am watching second time your interview as he is under arrest. You are the hero of our nation journalist
He got what he deserve
Anyone after august 22😂
When you buy 'Truth With Chamuditha' from a branded store :)
This monkey never allowed Ranil to talk,crazy monkey.
he is in prison now
Ur. Supar   mahdi.  Ranel.   Fox
Really happy to see Mehdi do this interview! I've been thinking to move to SL for some time, about to visit in January. I've been binging history videos like crazy. Perfect timing. This'll be my binge tonight after work to get some new insights on SL life & problems, and also, can't wait to go through the comments to see what people think :D.
This is the Ranil’s real personality
Aged like fine wine 😂😂
Madura please just because he against the corrupt Church and Tamil diaspora fund that demonstrators and most of these demonstrators did not even realised it. Most of these demonstrators are feeling guilty of their actions.
He showed real leadership. this journalist not allowing him to continue to finish his speak. Well done Ranil.  These journalist need to grow up and  live another 7 lives to get what you want. From Ranil🤣🤣🤣
Bro was like: Come on man, this wasn't the question I paid you to ask. :(
Who is watching after he remanded?
Ranilge agillak na kiyala danne ada thama
he does not even let Mr. President to answer ! SO anyone who is watching this can understand this is cut and edited interview. This is not democracy ! Shame about Aljaseera
Greedy politician J.R. Jayawardane is the man behind 26 year war. He has created an artificial ethnic conflict between Tamils and Sinhalese in order to keep his power in 1983.
බටලන්දේ වදකයා හිරේඑ ඉද්දි බලන අය ඉන්නවද ??
Watching again after he's been arrested 🤩.
Mr.  Ranil Wickremasinghe took charge of a devastated country which no, at the time took responsibility to. He some how managed to uplift the situation of Sri Lanka. The protestors were rioters and had caused massive damage to a lot of property and lives in Sri Lanka. Mr.  Wickremasinghe took necessary action to make peace in the country at that time. And if anyone was accused of crimes, it is the Sri Lankan judiciary system to make a person guilty or not. The protestors were majorly influenced by the JVP activists who took advantage of the unstable condition of the country to come in to power. Which they successfully did, they are now in power with 159 seats. They  spread false accusations against the Rajapaksha's regime which are currently being found were false accusations. Most people just mostly see from above with no proper idea about the political game. Politics in itself is how it is. If someone is accused then it is the court that provides the justice. And it is necessary to take certain measures in order to make certain things right it is a policy of give and take. Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe is the person who saved the country from the 2022 economic crisis of Sri Lanka and  we as a nation are truly grateful for his service.
Now he arrested from Sri Lankan new government ❤
This is the worst interview I have ever seen. Such a shame that journalists like Mehdi Hasan are given a platform while denying the person being interviewed enough time to respond. His conduct with Ranil Wickremesinghe was disgraceful, mocking, interrupting and shaming. I’ve seen Mehdi interview other world leaders and never witnessed the same treatment. This is clearly a biased diaspora agenda at play. Shame on him.
Thank you mehdi hassan and Al-Jazeera for this ❤
He was arrested ❤
Breaking News: Ranil arrested. What did you do Mehdi????
Debt is disaster for all countries and peoples welfare.
I went to funeral of budhist doesn't mean I am become budhist but my good neighbour.
It has existed for many centuries in the past they can't be taken over by anyone other than the people of Sri Lanka!? Get it or get lost.
this guy is the international version of our chamuditha. 😂😂
Ranil ❤️‍🔥
RW is a puppet and a deal maker, he is smart enough to tackle others to save his buddies and power, never thought about the ppl of Sri Lanka, he is a rejected refused politicians
When asking his responsibilities as former pm in 2019 Easter attack  he said I’m buddists 😂
Is Mehdi trying to give him a heart attack?😂
Rajapaksa's puppet
Poor journalism.. bullying interviewer. Let the interviewee respond. Disappointing. Trump would have shut you up in a second...
0:10 flying monk?😂
jesus the whiplash from this mans logic is beyond unreal
we are clippy , we are many , we are one
Mehdi is clearly too biased and needs to give more time for guest to answer questions
What a cynical jerk this guy is
As a neutral person listening, not knowing anything about Sri Lanka, this looks like an ambush. The man is making reference to systems within Sri Lanka however anytime he is making a good point, the subject is quickly changed to push the initial agenda.
He is like every desi uncle
Corrupt politicians
😂😂😂
This so called journalist interviewer has shown such disrespect to this former prime minister of Sri Lanka This is so unprofessional that he talks over and does not want to hear the counter comments and it reading from a prepared script of questions purposely to present to humiliate his interviewe He quotes comments from sources that has provided him with inflammatory and disengenious statements to create a hostile interview that the PRIME MINISTER is not permitted to reply too,to challenge what is presented,YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO YOUR PROFESSION ON EVERY OCCASION YOU SAY ANYTHING ,,AND NOT ALLOW A REPLY 😢😢😢😮😮😮😢😢😢
There must be no PMQ in Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa can't get used to the interrogation.
I appreciate him to have sat and answered when we see all the leaders avoiding any journalist interactions like this. This is how hournalism should be. Love from india
Sinhalese people are stupid. They supported them back then and now they turned their back after they found out they screwed them over. LOL.
He was holidaying, in Oslo, Brussels, and London,  as they all do!😂 The murderous regemes, have continued, in Sti Lanka to date.
What a joke of a prime minister he was for Sri Lanka. Such an arrogant man who can’t answer what is being asked. Typical subcontinent politicians answers.
Nirdev getPukka?
Killing boss @ Batalande Ranee housing scheme?
Thuggery ex prez Batalande raniya comedian?
This is exactly how journalism shouldn't be. Only allegations but no time to response....
Now that is a journalist.
Invite Narendra Modi Please
You should let people speak after asking questions.
please do something for Pakistan as well. we are being governed by crooks.
This former president’s responses were absolutely pathetic—got cornered throughout the interview, and it was unintentionally hilarious. He talks like our very own dictator, Sheikh Hasina.  Mehedi Hasan really turned this into a masterpiece!  Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Whoever supports Ranil is supporting illegal killings of those youths and corrupted system they carried out for decades.
The most satisfying Mehdi Hassan interview 💯
Ranil appointed a committee to distort the investigation
Atterny general is appointed by the president 😂
After hearing all the conversation from everybody as a sri lankan that i can say president Ranil wikramasinghe im really proud of u n proud to be a sri lankan as well n peoples of sri lanka are really impressed with the way u answer all those questions....that's the way forward as a nation i believe.
This is the day that Ranila thought would never occur
This guy is a thief hanging to power.
Oh isn't this 'my friend' guy? Did the TV company grab a random man from the street to be the tv presenter?
I am not srilankan however I came to know many things through this interview. I think srilankan people need justice for the lost of innocent lives.
mr been🤣  sri lanka version 😂😂 මේ වගේ ජෝකර් ලත් ජනපති වෙලා හිටියා ලංකාවෙ 😢😢
Mehdi spent more time haranging his guest than allowing him to speak.  What a horrible host!
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a very nice and  intelligent  leader.  Always  Aljaseera journalist  tries on behalf of LTTE.  Aljaseera doesn' t  talk about  what ltte did. Ltte killed many inncent sinhalese people. Ltte terrorists destroyed many properties  of country. There are many   LTTE members at tje audience. All those people at the audience   are members of the LTTE. Why doesn ' t  Aljazeera talk about  terrorist acts of LTTT ?  Shame on you Aljazeera.  You have planned to bring LTTE supportors for tje interveve.
The biggest JOKER Sri Lanka ever had...Prime minister for 6 times , Back door President ,,,,Tell one thing he has done  during his 45 years as Minister and MP which will not be forgotten  b people of S/Lanka ??? except his killings in his Batalanda killing chambers, burning of that Jaffna Library with his UNP goons,   Architect of "Central Bank'  robbery. Violation of fundamental rights of people  by postponing of all elections......
Now we can realize value of  this great leader Ranil wickremesinghe ❤
As a tourist, former resident and former spouse of a Sri Lankan, it is heartening to see that there are professionals the world over who lead to end the global impunity🙏  Whether it is a Rehabilitation Act leveraged against targeted communities who witnessed or were subjected to atrocities, the cunning lies, the lack of appreciation for human dignity, freedom and widespread misogny, or Truth and Reconciliation processes initiated non consensually and against innocent professionals who take no interest at all in the pursuit of a career in politics, only a rule of law can save us.   Godspeed to Sri Lanka - fare well🙏🧘‍♀️🕊️
This journalist is excited and angry . He can't control himself.
I don’t like the interview...too much talking with interception without getting answers with patience
O Mehedi Hasan, be kind and soft to this poor old man, pls। Anyway its pleasure to see the corrupt politician is cornered with your witty questions।
Mehedi Hasan is always very entertaining, nightmare for the corrupt politicians।
If i was a Corrupt Politician How could i Accept Mehdi's Request for an interview? These corrupts are really that stupid and go for it without doing an actual homework about who's interviewing them....
Mainly Rajapakshas, and Ranil too.
He is tough on mehndi
Ranil wickramasinghe ❤
For next show can you please bring Sophia Tesfamariam, Eritrean representative to the UN. There is a lot to discuss about Eritrea and the politicians there.
Mr. Hassan is quite childish, he should ask tough questions with relevant facts. Clearly hear he want to propose his narrative without giving time or audience to the guest.
India playing Dirty games in srilanka
Who cares? Not my problem!
Have seen this interview sometime back  Thanks
Man who saved the sri lanka ❤......president Ranil wickremesinghe ❤
صوم صلاة سرمن نينا لاني مختل عقليا نور
For a neutral person, Mehdi is constantly interrupting and allowing former president to reply
Who talks about terrorists while knowing how they bomb all around the world? Who discusses Rajapaksa and the civil war without realizing that it wasn’t a civil war? It was a conflict aimed at protecting Sri Lanka from the LTTE terrorists who sought to divide the country. Foreign nations consistently attempt to undermine the peace in my nation. That lady and the media presenter don’t seem to have sufficient knowledge, even as legal professionals. We know how we suffer in our childhood due to the terror and destruction caused by these bombings; there is nothing left to discuss. It is not a brutal civil war; it is a war against those who seek to divide the country. We are one nation under one flag. We are a nonviolent nation. The media and various foreign entities attempt to create a cold war atmosphere and encourage division among our people. You never can do what you want in inside our country. 💪💪🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
The interviewer was terrible. He asks a question and when Ranil gives a brilliant answer he cuts him off. That's disgusting. And he keeps misquoting Ranil. This is Aljazeera.
Sri Lankan people :  We got some inspiration from you 😂  Don’t know if your economic system is recovered or not,,  Keep going good luck for you..  Here in my country our economic system is finally stable but our situation is getting worse day by day..  Don’t know what can future hold
He was like a grumpy infant. Felt like he was going to cry.
Do people enjoy interviews like this where a guy with a British accent says "I'm sorry Mr Prime Minister, Mr Prime Minister, excuse me Mr Prime Minister I'm sorry but I simply cannot let you get away with saying that. Admit you're bad and evil."
Yo Yo Yo Yo 😂😂😂😂
I never thought in a million years I would be saying this, but he makes British politicians look half competent !!!!!
You gotta admit, Mehdi is entertaining to watch.
Salute to Mehdi Hassan and Aljazeera
Australian born to Sri Lankans   What a disgrace Ranil mate.
Mehdi is so such arrogant trying to pin down an honorable person pretending to have the highest position to push down judgementally someone who has far higher authority & credentials than him.  Mehdi should be ashame of his uncalled-for debase hypocrite  behavior. A suppose intellectual with despicable bad manners. Possesed with irresponsible values disrespectful of dknow better the inner affairs of  country he is not even a citizen. Why not return to pakistan & solve his mother country's problem rather than intruding shamelessly into other political affairs.!!!
Who international amnesty  some case governments have right used force specially when protesters force themself in people house  parliaments  president place if president resigned  parliaments  appointed new temporary president is clear  government listen to protesters  is time to protesters  just cool down    give chance new president  but sri lanka protesters  double up violence overwhelm police  try take parliament by force  president down have choice to call for military  second why Mahdi act like every protesters  are legit when know very  arabs springs  organization by cia  operative only Tunisia was organic legit even  mosad try hijack but fails  bcuse Tunisia intelligent service dispatch  to watch foreigns  activity all  hotels ambassy  specially American & isrealis whoever look suspicious  sneak  hotel room  found  arrests 2 mosad agents this facts we all Libyan springs  funds  from Qatar cia operative face book
Its really really healed me
During economic craices, The credit line, from inda, was given to the , Rajapka Family members by Ranil wicrmasingha, Al Jazeera medi Hassan & BBC reporter exact on the spot right
Ranil wicrmasingha is shaking, hands & body, for the Al Jazeera medi Hassan question ❓  Well done ❤❤
They destroy there house's, themselves. Not from Aragalaya.Ranil paid million of Rupees for the former government ministers
Brilliant Mr Hasan.
Batalanda was once an army camp—one of many such camps that existed. When discussing this topic, it's important to understand the broader context, particularly the violent actions of the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), which was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including many prominent figures in the country. Notably, current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and several of his key ministers—such as Lal Kantha, Tilvin Silva, Vijitha Herath, and Sunil Handunnetti—were central figures in the JVP during that time. Anura Kumara Dissanayake was reportedly in hiding in Kandy during the height of the violence.  Although I no longer live in Sri Lanka, I’ve closely followed the Batalanda narrative, which in my view has been used by the JVP to deflect responsibility and shift blame onto others. Accusing former President Ranil Wickremesinghe of wrongdoing in this matter is, I believe, unjust.  Setting aside the Batalanda issue, it's worth simply observing the situation in the country since the current administration took power. Organized crime appears to have gained significant control, with daily reports of multiple killings. Media outlets like Al Jazeera, which often support narratives sympathetic to terrorism, only add to the confusion. It's disheartening to see so many people placing trust in such reporting.
Mehdi you are not giving the man an opportunity.
As a Srilankan, thank you very much for this interview, it really highlights some deep issues in our country's legal and political system.
Dear brother Mehedi Hasan,  please arrange a Head to Head interview with our leader Dr. Professor Muhammad Yunus sir
Human right & amisa group international have no credibility whatsoever they always destroy other countries I’ll agree you that!
This old ugly Indian accent man,I’ll agree one thing,human rights & amisa group international are created for destroying other countries they have no credibility whatsoever!
😅
Mr Hassan, You are seemed to be wrong because you are talking to one of a childish joker President of Sri Lanka. This dam fool, nephew of former President JR brings further discredit to the people of Sri Lanka.
How could  I go  against Rajapaksa clan when they appoint me to  the President which I  never achieved through an election.
43:18 Amazing part
It's so funny watching them talk over each other
Plz have interview with pm of nepal
No accountability.  Shame on him.  What a horrible interviewee!  These type of corrupted people lead their country and put distress to their people.  Shame on you, former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe.
oh man, so satisfying to see how quickly this senile moron crumbles when seated in front of a real journalist for the first time in his life 💀
The man who responsible for top level human right violations, bank heist and Easter attack
Mahdhi hasan sir Goooddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mehdi is an irritating idiot who likes asking questions without waiting for an answer.
Great president produced by Sri Lanka ❤❤❤❤..Ranil wickremesinghe
Ranil wickremesinghe is the greatest president of Sri Lanka ❤
Great leader Ranil ..❤......he saved the country .....some foolish sri lankan people cant understand ❤
President Wickremesinghe has incredible patience with that journalist. I doubt even  a local politician from small town USA would put up with  that Journalist with a mouth
That journalist likes to hear himself. He is running off at the mouth.  He doesnt even care to hear any answers
Ranil Wickremasinghe is our leader
It is very annoying that Wickremesinghe, however wrong he may be, is not allowed to complete a sentence. As an interviewer, this Mehdi character should talk less and listen more.
Ranil is corrupt!
I find the interviewer not allowing the guest to express themselves wholly. If there is paucity of time, then reduce the number of questions so there is a fair chance for response sharing. Mehdi can learn from the likes of Pranoy Roy who conduct a respectable interaction. Had to drop watching this mid way.
Now srilanka should listen to jihadis Al Jazeera and Mehdi Hassan . What a joke you are Mehdi
Ranil Wickremesinghe is one of Sri Lanka's best leaders. Sadly, we did not fully benefit from his valuable service because many people did not understand his great vision. Deeply respect you, sir, for all that you have done for Sri Lanka
Respect Al Jazeera ❤
19:41 he probably thought in his head that this was a proper mic drop moment. Nobody gave a rat's 🍑
Singhalese are total clowns since their independence from the Brits they have taken the country back to stone ages....they started crying as soon as they realised they no longer have rice and medicine in their own homes...
Why these so called English clowns claps before get an answer and not after that??
He gave it back to this jihadi journo! Qatar is not even a democracy imagine them telling the rest of the world they dont have human rights! Srilankan brothers dont fall for the agenda.
Worst Anchore  The way this program is conducted is not correct .  He is implementing his personal thoughts
Huge respect to aljazeera and mr.mehdi hassan..

Ranil Wickremesinghe is a brute who has a deep hatred for the Sri Lankan people. If he could speak to this empty space, he would tell the truth. No matter what we say, we will not accept it.
Puluwan deyak karala pennako .....mata baya nethnam....mama ranil wekrama singhe
Mr Hassan is one of top debaters in the world, so in that sense, Mr. Wickremesinghe faces this debate exceptionally well and defends than any other man who faces Mr. Hassan.
Excellent BBC reporters
All Catholic churches rejected the Ranil wicrmasingha & Rajapka Family members. That's why NPP members 159 & Anura government
Ranil wicrmasingha can't speak English with Al Jazeera Reporter Mehdi Hasan, well well done , Mehdi Hasan ❤❤
Ranil wicrmasingha not a budist, he doesn't have any real Religion? His Religion is Homosexuality,
Well-done,medi Hasan- Al Jazeera, Do training session to Sri Lanka  jernalist😂
Ranil wicrmasingha paid dubel, payment for All Rajapka & Crew to Bribe appointment as president
Aljazerra is a disgust.
I don't like the fact that the interviewer doesn't allow the former president to finish his sentences.
Vikramasinghe did great.... Aljazeera should be banned everywhere..India already banned in India ..Amnesty International is a puppet..they say what deep state wants to say
I stand by Israel ..they have all the right to protect Citizens of Israel...
hahahah..look who is asking ...the same whose father sponsors all kind of terrorists  like Hamas and Hizbollah...Aaliazeera own by emirs of Qatar where head office of Alqueda...office of the Hamas and place of shelter for  terrorists ...
Selling out the country's resources which they have NO sole claim over , do not be complacent: they are still ruinning sri Lanka's economy and getting paid for it.  Moreover they can be re-elected once someone else some interim government in 2025 has rectified and bouyed the economy, later if these criminals regain power they will continue laundering money and selling out it's people.  When times are bad they hide.  When times are good they will reap the benefits and claim power.
We bow our heads to you for revealing to the world the deceit of the murderer Ranil by uncovering a hidden story.
What a stupid stuoid stupid stupid interviewer.. doesn't just want to listen to anything and wants to parrot his own narrative. Its as if he loves to listen to himself only.
I always said that to become a normal good politician you need to be more than 20 years old!!!
Mehdi Hassan! - I had heard  of this Crude anchor with the interviewer's arrogance and masquerade to show down interviewees but in this interview I am seeing it first hand!!   Brown British mimic with a lot of intellect directed at demolishing his own invited interviewees while leaving wisdom far away!    What an bootlicker of his paymasters who's sold his mother's teachings on behavior!  Mehdi Hassan-The Best Posterior of Al Jazeera!   There are better ways of exposing a politician deep in corruption.
Chinese Communist Party and their debt trap policy are to blame for Sri Lanka crisis
He the same league with Rajapaksa, there no question about it.
Not sure why Mehdi Hassan is given so much importance.. he brings guests, continuously interrupts them.. doesn't allow them to speak . Insulting your guest seems to be his only modus operandi..
Bad interview first time Hasan was rude and disrespectful.  Not letting him speak
He is not an real journalist
This guy does not even let him talk !
Take this. This is what you get for committing genocide against Tamils.
Is mehandi really understand what journalism actually is? Lol
I was in Sri Lanka when this interview happened. Nice country to see
If I speak like this journalist to a man his age, I'd be charged for assaulting a senior citizen.
India played a significant role in SLs implosion
Mehdi, too sharp for this guy
Indian Brahmins who claim to guardian of Hinduism never asked such questions. That's why Hinduism declined everywhere
sri lankawa  with Mr  RANIL  HARIMA LASSANAI ///GOOD
49.27    i think y r sri lanakan
Mr president good //// Mr mehdi you cant  cant    ////   SRI LANKA IS THE BEST //// PLS  CM AND VISIT SRI LANAKA /////////////U R MST  WL  COME //////
The first time in history an interview has taken place like this. HEADSOFF to MAHDI HASSAN and AL JAZEERA.
Brilliant!!! As always.
Why does south asian politicians crumble on most basic questions
My dear Brothers and Sister from Sri Lanka. Yes for a common man like you and me it's painful to see corrupt politician and we need answer for their actions.  My message to you, do not let over appreciate outsiders (this channel) for such questions..He is not interviewing he is interrogating to highest rank person of respected and sweetest country Sri Lanka. Not respectful.  This would give blowfire to outsider to deal in internal matter of Sri Lanka.  I see there are lot of people who are appreciating Hassan. This is not the way of talking to the guest.
If this journalist came to india, prime minister modi will have loose motions within a minute 😆😆
Corrupt politicians need a journalist like Mehdi Hasan to hold them accountable and expose the truth.
I hope he invites Dr. Jaishankar; it will be a lesson in proper decorum for him.
Its mind boggling that this journalist works for Al Jazeera that is sponsored by a country supporting terror groups and is not democratic and this journalist has the audacity to ask these questions. Shame on him.
Navigating the system instead of the victim...
Great job Al jazeera all questions inside my mind asked by you mister hasan now my heart satisfied 😌
I am from Bangladesh and I hate politicians. Thank u brother hassan!!!
Mr.Ranil speaks truly. He is one of great president we had. Whatever you want to convinced us is our problem. Not for world problem. However thanks for the discussion and look after Sri Lankan citizens.
the anchor is not looking for answer...just make statements and allegations...
Ranil murderer
@Mehdi, please learn Hindi language and do this with Modi
Hello Mr AL Jazeera why you not asking like that question Chinese Xi jinping about uigur muslim
Hassan please invite rajapaksa  family to your show
I am not taking anyones side but this anchorship is not neutral. That is not what they teach in journalism. As a journalist you need to be neutral and bring up both the sides before the audiance and let them decide thats it. You are not a judge you are an anchor only. And this is not media trial.
Mehdi is excellent journalist. I follow his Zeteo news. Its very good.
INDIA convince the LANKAN government to integrate with INDIA.
Mehdi is an absolute disgrace of a journalist. He has a predetermined narrative and is unwilling to listen to his guests. Terrible!
BTW  !!! open for booking. sri lanka's number one stand up comedian.( occasionally seated) Ranil Wickramasinha (watch out Russel peters)
Excellent reply by President Mr Ranil Singhe.  Journalist is behaving like a stupid person. Because journalist is not allowing to reply.
He's right about Medhi not allowing anyone to answer.. he won't ever shut up for more than 5 seconds!
Once again Ranil displayed himself not as a statesman but as a comedian.
EVERYONE'S BREAKING EACH OTHER EVERYONE THINKS THEIR COMMUNITY IS SUPERIOR NO ONES SATISFIED AND TRAPPED IN MIRAGE OF MONEY FAME POWER, HIDING REPEATED MISTAKES INSTEAD OF REFORMING TO LEAVE BETTER FOR FUTURE HUMANITY UNFORTUNATELY SAD TRUTH OF OUR PLANET 😢🇮🇳🕉️
Bjp gvt...plus mischief s
❤😢
If the comperor would interview Modi on the Human Rights issue in India as CM and PM on the same basis , many truths  would come out on the , corruption and brutalities would come out along with his HM at both positions
What exactly is this justice that Britain seeks? It is certainly not universal, nor impartial. The UK has never sanctioned its own war criminals, nor has it held accountable the architects of its colonial-era massacres. Winston Churchill, whose economic policies during World War II starved three million Bengalis to death in the Bengal famine of 1943, has never been posthumously condemned. The vast wealth stolen from India, estimated at $45 trillion over two centuries, has never been returned.  The survivors of the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya, who were tortured in British-run detention camps, were only offered meagre financial settlements decades later, long after most had died. Sri Lanka doesn’t even have proper records of the indigenous people who were virtually wiped out by the British. During British colonial rule in Burma, an estimated one million people died due to factors such as the Anglo-Burmese Wars, forced labour, military repression, and the devastating famine of 1942, which alone claimed between 300,000 to 500,000 lives.  Additionally, the forced relocation of indigenous peoples in Australia and the suppression of their cultures were part of Britain’s colonial atrocities. The exploitation of enslaved Africans and the brutal slave trade in the Caribbean also represents a dark chapter in British history, contributing to the immense wealth of the empire at the expense of human lives. None of these crimes have led to sanctions, nor have there been meaningful legal consequences.  Britain’s crimes extend beyond its colonial past into modern conflicts. During the Malayan Emergency, British forces executed civilians, burned villages, and detained thousands in camps. In Cyprus, they tortured anti-colonial detainees. The UK’s 2003 invasion of Iraq caused widespread destruction, while its 2011 intervention in Libya led to instability. In Afghanistan, British actions resulted in civilian casualties. This game is continuing. Despite ample evidence of war crimes, Britain has refused accountability, stalling efforts for reparations and justice. Meanwhile, with no substantive evidence—only fabricated claims—they continue to target Sri Lanka.  Sri Lanka’s war was not one of conquest; it was a battle against a ruthless terrorist organization that turned children into suicide bombers. The LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) did not merely kill civilians—it enslaved its own community. Young Tamil girls were forcibly recruited, stripped of their childhoods, and sent to die in combat. Adele Balasingham, an Australian-born UK citizen, was one of the chief enablers of this human tragedy.  She lived in Sri Lanka, training these girls, tying cyanide capsules around their necks, preparing them for war. Today, she resides peacefully in the UK, a country which proscribed the LTTE, untouched by legal scrutiny. Why has she not been sanctioned? Why does the British legal system, so eager to hold select few Sri Lankans accountable, offer her protection instead of prosecution? The idea that the UK sanctions Sri Lankan individuals for human rights violations while allowing known terrorists and war criminals to live freely within its borders exposes the fraudulence of this entire exercise.  Why does Britain get to keep its plunder, while punishing others for their wars? How can the descendants of looters lecture the looted on ethics? This is not justice. Walter Rodney, the Guyanese historian, meticulously detailed the economic and political strangulation imposed by European powers on Africa in How Europe Underdeveloped Africa.
How about Bring Gotabhaya rajapaksha? Will stand a chance of winning an oscar
Can any political leader in Sri Lanka participate in an interview like this?
The Anchor or interviewer is trying hard to put his words in mouth of the politician. That's not the way. Who in Amnesty, who are other world bodies to dectat what a ruler should or should not do? Hassan and his likes have an agenda. They are experts in pushing all the wrong things in a dictator's tone. They have always a lopsided facts and figures to "creat" a scene.
India’s silence on the atrocities in Sri Lanka was very political and let this all happen.
What kind of anchor he is ?? He is not allowing him to talk!
Mehdi should let his guests speak, he cuts them off unfairly too many times
Mehdi Hasan is a baised journalist who doesn't allow his guests to talk. This was not an interview, it was a session of allegations without a right to reply 😂.  Just like the rest of his interviews
just to be clear. although I agree with these crooks being booted out of parliament (rajapaksha + Ranil W.) don't ever say Mahinda Rajapakshe is a war criminal. he is the reason we have peace in Sri Lanka. don't ever forget that
He is litterally crying while putting a laugh in his face , what a clown , these are the same kind of politicians in South and South East Asia. No accountability to the nation and its people. The only accountability is to power and money .
Mehdi is such a bully. He spends all the time asking questions without letting him answer. I'm an Indian and have nothing for or against Sri Lanka. Mehdi's holier than thou approach to every problem in the world is frankly abhorrent.
sad really
Sri Lankha is so beautifull island country but in the hands of dumb corrupt people.
Totally, ranil was damaged 😂😂😂😂
I mean come on. Mehdi is plainly bullying the politician here. Props to him for asking the right questions but maybe give Ranil a right to reply lol
The interviewer is being very foolish asking questions, without knowing the facts. Let’s see what European governments would do when their properties are being destroyed.
Typical Asian Uncle- Read the report🥲
Madame Madura❤
I saw the Tigers laughing in the audience—this is not the end. This is a moment of silence
The second hand embarrassment I feel is beyond this universe.... 😅
Mehdi, let the man talk. You are an ignorant A***.
Mehdi Hasan , please let your guest finish his answers before you interject.
Islamic Radical Sympathiser asking Questions???
Ranil dont even think of comparing yourself to Buddha.
Cause they killed one politician? What about the 65,000 youth who you killed in detention centres  batalanda and welikanda? Ranil wikramasinghe you are a murder.
Thank you so much to interview he and please quickly take to interview rajapaksha family
One of the worst and corrupt politicians in Sri Lanka
Thiu   chawien
Ranil has been foolish 😂😂😂none violence 😂😂😂f....n ranil.there has been a civil war it's been grabbed only coz of u.justice will be surprised for you.we know how you have utilized the money from IMF
Al Jazeera, you have discussed the civil war between the LTTE and the government, which lasted for almost 20 years in Sri Lanka. While the LTTE's initial intentions may have been good, they also carried out numerous atrocities and genocides against the Muslim minority living in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.  I would suggest that Al Jazeera interview some current pro-LTTE individuals and ask them to justify their actions, too!
SRI LANKA MUST ACCEPT ISLAM AS THE ONLY RELIGION IN THE COUNTRY
No program on human rights violations in Oman 😂
It was evident in that country. They have huge opportunity in their country but they don't tap those opportunities. They work neighboring countries, talk a lot n promote office politics. Sorry...
The interviewer is some guy. He's got to listen.
Ranil got rid of his boyfriend Vincent Fernando who were to testify in Commission set up to investigate Batalanda Torture Camp.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is one of the worst people  on this earth!
Great medi Hassan, Salute you . Inside the full suite a murderer is there
33:08 she completely right. People in power are completely devoted to doing everything to please the majority rather than doing what is correct 🇮🇳
Asking and eating, ranil never in his life thought that he will, be shamed in front of the whole world
Ranil, you are a Royalist.  Not an Indian or Pakistani coolie or their "IT INANIMATE DESCENT".    You should have never given audience to coolie shia moslem traitor terrorists like this in the first place.  REMEMBER OUR FATHERS SONG.  AN PURE ENGLISHMAN LIVED IN THE BRITISH CEYLON
“Let me ask you this” -Mehdi about to end someone’s whole career
He hasn’t answered a single question . U wasted the air ticket 😁
Ranil grate politicians
RW is the culprit  of violence who inflicted physical and psycological torture that the youth have gone through since 87 to 90 . He was the man still alive
Mr.Hassan first thing I'll told thanks for this real interview and please translate to this interview for Sri lankan both local language because there peoples need  to must watch this  interview ❤🙏
Sri lanka is like 'A house which has antenna outside but no tv inside'   Do everything to get the international fame and people are struggles without food 😂 😂
Mehdi rocked seeya shocked 😂
👍
Why is he smiling when asked about Batalanda?
Ranil and rajapaksha ' s destroyed sri Lanka ...
Soon, it will hit one million views.
Don't forget to interview mahinada rajapaksa and his son's please 🥺
We know what happened to the monkey who polled the wedge out of the log😅😅😅😅😅😂
This is not journalism. Medhi is not letting the President answer. Disgusting journalism.
12:10
However he ruled the country he try to depend the early government although he didn't participate.  I appreciate your patience Mr. Wicramasingha.
Bullshit media for stupid fun😂😂😂😂 Shame on Al Jazeera.😅😅
12:22 I think Hassan was rost hr 😂
Throughout the interview, i tried to be impartial and gave the dude benefit of the doubt. Purely based on how the guest conducted himself made it real hard. That was embarrassing and a joke.  I can't comprehend how lives of millions of people can be in the hands of this dude. Deflection, disinformation, denial, no accountability, I can't see a grain of integrity and weak moral compass.   Depressing.
Gotabaya Rajapaksha asked from every politicians in Sri Lanka to take the presidence.Finally Ranil took the presidence because he was thinking about the people in Sri Lanka. As if we see about the president election 2024 results Sri Lankan people has been forgeted the work done Mr. Ranil Wivkramasinghe .
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a very genious person. Because he ju devolped the Sri Lanka in 2 years. He has a good experince in Politics.
Hats off Mr.Mehdi , done a good job against the double standard shylock.
please interview of Shahbza Sharif from Pakistan next
❤❤❤❤
He gave  coverage to the full Rajapakshe family regime
RANIL W. KNOWS VERY WELL TO BLUFF ALL TIMES.
Mehedhi dhe dumb muslim... just becauae u oppose some.on truthbdoesnt change
Ranil is the murder he will arrest soon as possible 😢
I was studying this interview and it's very questionable why audience doesn't have fare representation of all nationalities of Srilanka. Also I think its good if interviewer  listen to the invitees/guest speakers answer before he gives his opinion. H2H is a good program and I would like to see this interviewer interviews Donald Trump 😊. Good luck.
He is a Criminal 😔 he killed my grandpa
Thanks you
mehedi was nodging his head about thestory of buddha without not knowing whats coming bro was castled on that😂
Ranil go go
When interviewing non-English speakers, it is not an act of journalistic vigor to outspeak them
The country was in turmoil when terrorism was at its height, the lives of all in the government administration were at stake, from the topmost position of the executive president of the country to everyone in the rural village administration.   Families of officers in the security institutions from civil to defense were exposed to terror attacks like being burnt alive. Even the judiciary was victimized and in disarray.   Office going workers, the backbone of the country’s economy, were unaware whether they would return back home as a whole.    Bomb blasts in buses and crowded bus stands blasted to pieces office going workers and alerts would make office going workers run helter skelter. Office going workers in Jam packed trains would travel with utmost fear not knowing which would be the next target for the terrorists.    Even the lives of school going children weren't spared, they were blasted to pieces in school entrances.   Even devotees visited worshipping sites in fear of being caught to bomb blasts and bullet spray, it was the same for pilgrims too who were not spared of being killed.   Parents didn't know how to protect their children who were lured to arms training or forcibly recruited against their wishes by terrorists.   Citizens at home were in fear whether their home would be the next target for looting by armed terrorists who were collecting funds for their movements.   Their economic policy was such that they considered the elderly beyond 55 a burden to the country’s economy and trained their cadres to kill the elderly in their families.   What do you expect from the security forces who have lost their family members in terror attacks and who have witnessed mutilated bodies strewn all over the place and on trees and rooftops. How do you expect the security forces, to handle such terrorists,   How do you expect the government to interrogate terrorists when it's intelligence agencies know that there are tens of bombs that are going to explode in civilian targets tomorrow and they have apprehended some terrorists in this regard . When thousands of civilian lives are at stake tomorrow, how are they to interrogate and bring out information at such a short time. Do you expect to pet them while questioning?   The government's responsibility is to the people and not the terrorists who want to thrive on terrorizing civilian life and limb.
He is Nation's grand dad and we always LOVE him except his stunning Dance
Bro didn't expect these questions to be asked, he was thinking that this is going to be a play time instead, got what we were looking for! Such a child
Million thanks to Al Jazeera... i am from Tamilnadu IND
This is no way to conduct an interview. This is an interrogation  & harraguing. Utterly shocking
You’re great….
Ranil is a criminalis
What an utter disgrace! No accountability and constant denials. Typical politicians. No reconciliation no healing no constructive answers to questions 🤷‍♂️
මම දැකල තියෙනවා සමහර බටහිර නායකයින්ට මෙවැනි මාද්‍ය හමු වලදී සෙරෙප්පු ගලවා පහර දෙනව.මෙයාට ඒකත් ලැබුනනම් සියල්ල සම්පූර්ණයි..🤣🤣
I think this is the best interview 👍
Wow amazing .. good journalist
Please ask Shaikh Hasina to come for an interview please.
Thank you so much Al Jazeera ,,thank You Mr,Mehdi,,you all are.doing a wonderful job,,expect more,,
I challenge him to interview ABS…
Well done Mr mahdi thank a lot ,
Inside the sri lanka this gentleman thinks he is only the  one very smart and well educated and professional politician...he has experience only losing the elections.look at his face how he acting like a innocent but panicked 😮also this jernorlist doesn't care about his unwanted answers he is keep focusing his job....😅😅😅 Ranil should want more prepared before sitting the arguments.... finally all are criminals in a point view.
Bro bring sheikh hasina 😂
The question from the audience member at 43:17 is 💯
As a Tamil I felt triggered by the crimes commited on Gazans and hold the Palestinians in my prayers ❤
06:40 ruined his point 😂
As a Tamil whose family had to flee to Canada back in the 1990s because of the civil war - on behalf of our families who suffered, were displaced and murdered - thank you for this interview 🙏
Non-violent nation?! Biggest joke. Shame to all the innocent Tamils who were murdered!
This is so messed up…
Aljazeera rocks. What a constructive and brave interview. Thank you so much. Very much soothing for wounded hearts.
Hats off to this journalist and his method of conducting the entire discussion. I hope this is a real example for fellow journalists in Sri Lanka who are experiencing issues interviewing these politicians. Hopefully, these kinds of talks should be translated and broadcast on local television in Sri Lanka
Mr. Hassan vs a popular murderer
I have no idea of Sri Lanka politics but from what I've seen in this head to head talk, I noticed how defensive he became and you can tell by the body language of the former president. His answers were not convincing and you can also tell he had no empathy for the lost lives of innocent civilians. Politics of today's so called democracy is a farce. We live in a jungle run by corrupt people.
All Sri Lankan did the protest against this corruption. Not to disrupt the country.
Great job Bro !  This old man should be in the jail
Great work work 🎉🎉🎉 as a Sri Lanka thank you very much Al Jazeera
Hasan is no "real" journalist. He is a gun for hire. The problem is, he is only willing to be hired by Americans or their proxies.   Hasan is far more interested in making his victims look bad and then he thinks that he has earned his blood money.   This individual is as immoral as the worst killers for hire.
As below continuously.... in of correction please ,,,, Growth and the goodness even negllecting manner on providing the meals in quantity, stantardiation in Educational activity  granting the cruel and dangerous with irritating acts as of ideas to the leadership men and women please  The minority group in Ceylon is a questionable matter still
As I am from Northern  division of Ceylon having been known well of political affairs would say about Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe was in the parliament from the muderous act on the late of Jimmi Carter byy aiming act from such of long distance as such of the murderer or killer was away from Mr Ranil also was away from the gorthe on minority go please.
as a srilankan, respect to this interview  🔥🔥
Ranil was shocked when he heard about Batalanda.
Today imperialists are dwindling our economies by fostering extremism and arming terrorists in our countries. By arming the terrorists they have made our governments drain its resources on arms and ammunition.   We educate our youngsters with our tax money. The imperialists by encouraging terrorism in our regions not only sell their arms and ammunition but also steal our intellectual youngsters who want to escape civil strife by providing them safe haven in their countries.   The Arabs from the deserts and Persians, who are now Mohammedans, invaded us for our spices and our lush Vegetation. The Christian Europeans conquered us to produce non intoxicated brews like cocoa, coffee and tea. To produce rubber that was essential for mobility. Timber by clearing jungles in our countries for furniture. Conquered Africa for rain forest logging for construction .   Today Christian Europeans are conquering countries for rare earth elements that's essential for modern day technology and nuclear power.   Today Nuclear power is everything. Alternative energy sources are everything from lithium batteries as the source, while fossil fuel is depleting.   It's very minimum that you can rely on wind, solar and other sources. Hydro power is very limited to some countries.   The problem is are we going to sacrifice the jungles and mountains that brings rain for agriculture the very source of our existence for science and technology and mine for rare earth elements.    Today the African countries bonded to slavery have people malnourished and starving due to the imperialists having been using their countries to mine for uranium, plutonium and rare earth elements ever since the second world war.   If we start mining for minerals we will end up as the African continent, Burkina Faso, Niger or Nauru   Nauru inhabitants now have to move out of their country as there is no land for them to live on, they are left with just quarries after Mining for minerals. They led a very cozy life by Mining for minerals and being the wealthiest country on earth. They were relying on imported food supplies. Today they have no more minerals to mine and have no land to produce food and no money to import their food supplies.
with regards to war crimes its so biased and not the truth. everything else is correct
ලොක්ක නාගන්නව වගේ පිලිවෙලකට😁
This Tamil lecturer and the BBC reporter well whole of Jazeera was planned to discredit anyone one who fought and save the country from TAMIL LTTES we all know them all supporters Tamil realm they are not talkibg Sinhalese people that were killed in temples mothers were killed and hack their fetus from bellies they are only talking about Tamil people so Sinhalese ar3 not human beings according to tjem they dont even bother mentioning anythibg about it and we all know they funded the terrorists LTTE so lets not waste time here
To those whining about "disrespecting" Ranil and him not getting a chance to talk, he did at 4:44, 5:30, 7:50 (about his refusal to hold elections), 10:09 (why he let go of the golden opportunity to hold MR, the mastermind behind everything, accountable), 16:00 (the shameful protection of GR while being a dictator to the protestors), 19:00 and 22:00 (washing his hands of his role as PM and MR's direct role in the Easter attacks), and many other instances. He laughed, discredited evidence, praised himself, and had childish responses like "no contest" and "nonviolent history" to every serious accusation throughout this interview. You blind fanboys are a huge part of why we may never recover our country and its economy.
Thanks Mr Ranil wickramasigha Participate And handling this  Event Very responsible and positive way. We love our Tamil Friends and Sri Lanka . Why are they tring to bring this problem again to the Table.  We need peace and equality for all the people in Sri Lanka.  .
You not good man
Can you invite Venancio Mondlane or a Rep of Mozambique's Frelimo Party?  No one has held the Frelimo party accountale for the economic decline (including the Debt scandal) of Mozambique..
Hassan is a loser because he doesn't let people talk.
ඇදං නානව කියන්නෙ මේවට 🎤
One of the individuals who survived the Batalanda torture center has come forward and given his eyewitness account before his hands were nailed to a log. This individual's name is Dr K Arnold Dayasena. He was one of the 60,000 undocumented young men and women who was tortured, raped and killed while Mr. Ranil Wickramasinge and his buddies were sipping brandy and enjoying the scene.  The reason Dr K Arnold Dayasena endured such an atrocity is because he wrote the following poem.   පෙරට තැබූ පය ආපසු ගන්න එපා! කම්කරුවන්ගේ වැඩ වර්ජන කඩනු එපා! ලක්දූපුතුන් නැසුමට අවි ගන්න එපා ! මහා ජනතාව මිස පල් හොරු රකිනු එපා! උතුම් ලක්බිමට  කරන නිසි මෙහෙය  සෙබල සොයුර කුමටද ඔබ ඇති අවිය නොපා නිවට කම් පපුවට ගෙන එළිය  දැන්වත් වරෙව් ඔසවන්නට ජයකොඩිය
Brilliant interview. Look forward to many more.
I absolutely love how this journalist put this නාකි පරයා at his place😂😂❤❤
Thanks Al Jazeera.He is a Killer.
Mehedi please interview Any Awami politician like this  Hats of to true journalism  Love from Bangladesh ❤️
omg,mr Ranil Wikramasinghe's cooked😂
Sri lankans ✋
Britain left all this chaos behind  and they still trying to stir trouble
Mehdi must thinking he is clever as RW struggled to answer. So could be the audience.  Actions speaks louder, yes so called bad actions as well. Good & bad has a very different meaning in politics. According to most of good people politics itself is bad. Nothing is absolutely good or bad in life. There are circumstances and your job is making choices in each. Ranil did his, and he did what the country needed. Eliminating jvp was required back then. Later LTTE but it wasn’t him who ended it, Rajapakse did. Medi Hasan, unnecessary connected RW to Rajapakse saying “I saw you at a birthday party”.
Well, if Medhi (The Race Grifter) Hasan had a say, somehow this is all my fault, because I’m a white working class man.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a great leader and he is the most experienced politician in Asia. Al jaseera  always Supports  terrorists ..RW  ❤❤❤❤
Arrogant Jounalist.
As an Indonesian who knows nothing about sri lankan politics and crisis. That "Rajapaksa" name means "Forced King" or "The king who forced" which is pretty funny
These comments are so much positive than I thought. I thought our fellow _siri_  lankans will go like  _"ranil kiyanne patta wadagath igenaganipu minihek balannako cuddec ecca ingricigen vivada carana hati blah blah..."_ in comments lol.
Still struggle to understand why CNN sacked Mehdi Hasan
Tamil Tigers committed gross violations of human rights as well. Is anyone discussing that. This was a war.
Tamil Tigers were terrorists who were trying to overthrow a democratically elected government. Look what Trump is doing now.
This reporter is an idiot. Shouting over the ex president. The guy doesn't like to be told facts.
Respect to Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe🙏
This is the most disrespectful journalist I’ve ever seen 😅😅
Mr Bean from ebay 😪
The host is brutal totally unnecessary
The outcome of an interview completes when you get the complete answer. Wickramasinghe wasn't allowed to answer it. Mehdi Hassan should have been more responsible when bringing a "head of state" to the world's most prominent platform. In my view, this interview wasted the time of audiences and viewers.
ranil is a mastermind only time he got cornered upon batalanda
Mehdi Hasan is just incredible🔥
He couldn't be a leader. His attitude is one that gets you nowhere

Im from 🇱🇰. Thanks al jazeera for exposing this murderer
Hey Mehdi! I dont know in which propaganda you ran this segment. But thank you very much for asking those questions from Ranil. This chapter made time to table a commission report after 25 years. Can you believe that, after 25 years. Dont know the way forward, but whatever is said and done a day or a day, all of us must answer nature! ❤❤
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe handled the interview like a charm, a real professional indeed! The interviewer however makes things unnecessarily loud to overpower any truthful answers when heard, a cheap tactic that’s too obvious throughout the interview.
That’s the worst interviewer ever. When RW doesn’t give the answer he wants he interrupts and says what expects😂 I thought a journalist should be impartial. If you ask a question let the other person finish answering.💀
This guy won't get punished for his crimes by the new Sri Lankan government either. As now its justice system becoming corrupt as well.
this guy overtook mahdi
Sri Lanka Wish you “Al Jazeera “
Mr Hassan thanks a lot .,, perfect meeting& really good  questions.
what a clown
after the age come we must except that old can never change for the new and adopt to the change hence they never want to let go of the thread that hangs there wealth , power , and there friendly organization they have in Sri Lanka they argue and fight only inside of the parliament out side they are just friends with benefits. shameful way to live but it is the reality of it
Ex president is a visionary leader in sri lanka ❤
Ex president ,Ranil saved the country ftom bankruptcy ❤❤❤
Great job next interview other guys. Namal. Mahinda. Etc😂😅
I didn't see Mehdi being polite and respectful with him . Mehdi has a sewage replys sometimes
Ranil is not the sri lanka. Sri lanka is a better country with most friendly people in the world who love all nations in this world and want to make this world change better for future. The one you are interviewing is a well known criminal who hide behind dirty politics in sri lanka
Niraj is a henchmen of Ranil W, if his house was burnt with his expensive books, he was in power after that, he could have captured the people who had set fire to his house, as far as, we know, he himself had set fire to his house to become the president of Sri Lanka
Thank you Al Jazeera ❤
Mehdi, let the man answer, please
It is really a vibrant interview obviously contributing to heal sores of Srilankans heavily hurt and ravaged by the brutal civil war. Seeing is astounding  A mighty politician amounting  to an establishment being burnt with questions bringing under responsibility a rare happening indeed. Whatsoever like other african and latin american leaders let alone Philippines,   Ronil is a political leader of a third world country easily amenable to questioning for alleged genocidal incidents of mass killing, torching, abductions and other atrocities during civil war. These leaders can be questioned by Al Jazeera  caught and held responsible by the ICC. Commendable indeed to see them in this conditions.   It is very regrettable to see things when Al jazeera fails to bring before people and question leaders of the fast and developed world whose direct involvement inciting and carrying out genocide, mass killing and sheer human rights violations across the globe.  Where is Boush and tonny Blare  who loudly advocated in favor of having mass destructive weapons in Iraq following which vehement western led coalition (with NATO in place)  attacks took place in Iraq. Continuous bombardment killed innumerable civilians. Later the matter was disproved and it came out that there had been no mass destructive weapons in Iraq.  But the culprits of the war were not brought to law. They are moving freely and enjoying the fresh air on the earth. They have got the blanket impunity. If they had been the leaders of the third world, they would have been caught with hand cuffs and placed before ICC like the former president of Philippines. The imbalanced treatment of law and the culture of blanket impunity for the specific ones is impairing justice across the globe aggravating peace, security and stability. So perpetrators must be questioned irrespective of country and status. Men behind Genocide in Gaza and Rakhaine in Myanmar  remain unquestioned.   Hope days will come when possibly genocidal connections can be more precisely detected and connected individuals can be questioned and put on trial for proper punishment no doubt. The world is advancing towards, justice must follow its course whoever he is mightier or wealthier shall come under law and the world will heave a  sigh of relief. May not I may not you see their fate, but the universe will witness and send message to the heaven the earth has been free from the claws of the war lords and the  culprits and so enjoy.
Nice guy
Got Cooked!
Mine u got do Ethiopia
What about Ethiopia
Lack of pragmatism.....Poor Ranil
Please enable Sinhala and Tamil subtitles in this video. It will be very useful for the Sri Lankan people. @Al Jazeera English
I had lots of respect towards him while growing up but sad seeing his real tace
I don’t think Mehdi should visit Sri Lanka, he won’t be coming back 100%.   Dude doesn’t let anyone answer. Even before they can speak he will talk over them and steer the convo to what he wants to hear. I don’t understand why people allow him to interview, nothing valuable comes out as no one is allowed to talk. The best thing with Mehdi is to treat Mehdi like an idiot and say, you got 1 hour, 20 questions. Ask me a question for 30 seconds, let me answer for 1min and 30seconds and last min, let’s go through anything discussed. It’s the only way possible to cover topics. Otherwise nothing meaty comes out of the convo. I wouldn’t be surprised if mehdi’s wife smacks him when arguing with her, dude just won’t allow anyone to talk
Old man just go home
Countless thanks to mr mahdihassan,open the eye of sri lankans.....❤
Ranil Grandpa was intact until he met Mr. Hassan. Even Mrs. Wickramasinghe couldn't take his V card 😁. Thank you Al Jazeera!  Pro tip- If grandpa's stammering, obviously he's lying.....
😂
Is this full interview video or edited video.?
Hats off to Mahdi on behalf of all Sri Lankans!
Thank you al jazeera
Unbelievable disrespectful
Greetings from Mumbai -India I never liked Mehdi since he reminds me of that fool we have in India called Arnab G-but he did get under the skin of the Ex PM I hope Sri Lanka *heals & get stronger economically* & hopefully a few families in Sri Lanka do not dominate everything *like they have done in the past*
Thank you Al-Jazeera for such a important program.

omg!
Thank you ❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks to this interview, the report at least tabled in Sri Lanka Parliment.
As a sr Lankan , huge respect thank to the journalist ❤🎉
He’s definitely the main culprit behind the Batalanda torture camp. Thanks to this video, people are talking about it again, I pray that justice will be served for all the innocent victims.
He clearly underestimated Mehdi Hasan, assuming this would be just another local media session with Chamuditha and others where questions are sugar-coated to fit his narrative. Instead, he was exposed—speechless, defensive, and completely out of his depth. If anything, this interview confirmed that his leadership has been defined by evasion, arrogance, and an utter disregard for accountability.   The most ridiculous part was his attempt to dismiss the concerns of the Catholic Church regarding the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks as “nonsense.”🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️   What else could you expect from these so called heroes who's here to saved the nation from bankruptcy🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
As Srilankans we respect this person who stopped collapsing country to a worst stage and reorganize the country. Journalist really cornered in front of this political Giant.
Do not follow this stupid fabricated news by this TV Group 😮
put this cunning a*****le behind bars
Ranil used to speak bullshit all the time in Sri Lanka. But did nothing to the country.
He is a killer. 100%
Have watched a few of Mr.Hasan's interviews. Marked by statements often taken out of context, focus on sensationalism and interruption of the person being interviewed. If the objective of the interview is to bring out facts it can be done far more effectively if Mr.Hasan showed patience and diligence.
Enjoyed watching the Interview , Good work Mehdi, Thank you for your bold move !!
👏🏻
Dear Mehdi,  As Sri Lankans, we deeply appreciate your courage in exposing this criminal, who managed to escape justice many times with the support of past governments. Without your relentless efforts, he might have evaded accountability once again under this government. Your dedication and bravery are truly commendable. Thank you for your invaluable contributions—may you continue to serve the world, and know that Sri Lankans bless you every day for the incredible work you do.  With gratitude, Chris A
Journalist rock ranil roasted😂
Two sellouts

Thanks to aljazeera❤. and most  views in this video .can u take other politicians like namal/ mahinda

To be frank, MehdiHasan is bias now. He’s diff.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a cynical murderer who killed 68,000 young people in 1988/89 and burnt them in the pit of tires.
And now there's a report
Chamuditha English  🙂
What a shame
What a sad reality
every one thanks al jazeera but actually happend was a script of ranil that's the politics
Goog luck Al Jazeera ranil first time face with a good journalist,  always sri lanka  dont like this man
Can you also invite Mahinda Rajapaksha. That will be fun to watch.
You suck ranilll 😂😂
Thank you Al Jazeera🙌🏻
Seriously you should get Rajapaksha’
Million thanks to Al Jazeera. Mr. Hassan you will be go into the Sri Lanka's history and folklore as a hero. Today they table the report in the parliament because of you.
We havent got this kinda journalists in Srilanka so bro thought he can survive saying this and that blah blah.... Bro forgot this isnt Talk With Chamuditha and tried to threaten the media person , trued to change the topic , tried to act like a child but got failed terrible....😂
Why won't you bring in Anura Kumara Dissanayake who is the current President of Sri Lanka, who was heavily involved in the killing and robbery during the INCERGENCY during 1987-1989, and was hiding in Kandy for a long time because of all this. Why are you defending Terrorists? Keep in mind that people still have proof of all this.😂
Disingenuous terrorist lovers.
During 1987-1989 People went through agony with all the JVP KILLING. I CAN STILL REMEMBER. WE HAVE PROOF. ANURA KUMARA DISSANAYAKE WAS HIDING IN KANDY AFTER KILLING PEOPLE LIKE DOGS. Do not try to defend Terrorists. JVP IS A TERRORIST GROUP. 😢😢 Sad to see a British channel getting down to a 3rd class level of terrorist.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Most corrupted person in sri lanka.
Joker 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Why wasting time interviewing morons?

රනිලගේ කලිසම ගැලවූ අල්ජසීරාවට මාගේ පුනාමය
Thank you Mr. Hasan. 🇱🇰
Next mahinda family
Tamils were innocent. It was provoked and subsequently reaction from Tamils. In the end genocided.
Subject is about srilankan economy crisis, 99% talk abt war that srilankan army successfully destroyed TAMIL TERRORISM. And people called them International media? Haha my a$$ 😅
💜️💜️💜️💜️
Thanks to you mr. Hassan the batalanda report came to parliment today..thank you.
Update : Batalanda report tabled in sri lankan parliament today.   So , no longer Ranil rajapakshas crime is unofficial
I personally hereby announce mr.Mehdi as a national Hero.  Hats off man❤🎉
Today 14th March of 2025 The Batalanda Commission Report was laid before the parliament of Sri Lanka. On behalf of each & every law abiding citizen of Sri Lanka I would like to thank you.
Future suggestions -> Basil Rajapaksha, Namal 🤣
Thanks you for revealing about batalanda. Now that Ranil Wickramasinghe need to be punished
35:00 to 36:00 Finally batalanda commission report tabled (14 march 2025). Thank you Al Jazeera
Thank you so much al jazeera ❤❤
35:58   yes, today now it 's been tabled, (10:42  03/14/2025)
Can anyone explain why this interview has been hosted by  Al Jazeera media network? and Ranil is nobody at the moment,  Al Jazeera   couldn’t find any other political figure from the current government administration ? Is there any motive to bring back Ranil to Politics????
All the politicians are criminals
The bottom line is Ranil should be in jail already for the crimes he committed against Sri Lankan citizens. Also, all the corrupt politicians. He can't even respond as a mature man in this interview.
Poor leadership at its peak 😬
Busted 🤣🤣Next Question please
Why the interviewer didn’t ask Ra1nl for not winning the election despite uplifting the economy? May be truth is swept under the rug…😂 journalist purposely didn’t ask the question even though ra1nl reminded him several times and leading the viewers with biased ideology…
Wel done 👍 Al Jazeera also Mr.Mahdhi Hassan, may Allah bless his countless mercy Upon u this life & hereafter. Aameen
In a well-functioning justice system, the burden of proof rests with the prosecution, meaning the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Ideally, this standard of justification should also guide our public debates. However, in the realm of politics, emotions often take precedence, causing us to stray from this principle. I wish this debate had been more constructive, with both sides presenting evidence to support their claims and genuinely listening to each other. It is quite unfortunate that we couldn't see this in the interview.
Please bring rajapaksa family to this interview.
I hate Ranil, but this journalist doesn't give him proper time to answer the questions. The journalist is as horrible as Ranil.
Mashaallah  Alhamdhulillah  Thank you so very much  Al jazeera❤ Well done  Mehdi hassan I❤jazeera
Mahdi and the panel nailed it. The media hall became a court room.   Ranil got the real Journalist and Panel. Well done guys.   Please take interview one of the Rajapakse.  Thats why it says truth never dies.
Let him answer please instead of always interrupting.
From 2022 to 2024, Mr.Wickremesinghe stabilized the economy through reforms and international support, restoring confidence in Sri Lanka’s future.
Wickremasinghe the murderer….
මගේ රට නැවත අස්ථාවර කිරීමට ටැමිල් ඩයස්පෝරාවට අවස්ථාව දුන් වහලුනි, ඔබ සැමට දෙවියන් විසින් සාධාරණය ඉෂ්ඨ සිද්ධ කරනු ඇක.
Well-done.  Al.  Jazeera
He's.     Layer. Ranil. Layar
Not sure what he did before 2001, until his campaign killed my cousin in political violence. Although he did make harsh decisions during his term as president and make our small economy back again simply by declaring bankruptcy by the head of CBSL, he could have done better without being a capitalist. Everyone paid a price in whatever way after English stole our economy and here we are now after defeating the family ruling. Let’s see whats next…
No one talks about atrocities committed by LTTE, and no one appraises how the peace have developed in the island after the war, hats-off to this president taking part in this platform known for aggressive questions and facing the allegations
Not a Ranil fan, but Hasan is insufferable!   Not letting a guest to answer your question reveals a hidden agenda…
Really Really shame on you Ranil.
Ranil Wiclramasinghe has never been a good politician.  On the pther hand, that Madur lady is pumping lies.
Thank you al jazeera ❤
For the First time, Ranil must have felt he has been properly grilled and interrogated in front of an international area. Thanks to Al Jazeera !   Even though he tried to maintain his calm demeanour, he knew and we felt he is as guilty of whole corruption, allegations of civil war crimes, missing journalists and the  corrupt justice system for the victims of this country. That,  surely is   damning.
Greate job al jazeera.i will respect u..im from srilanka
Serial killer ranil vikkramasinhe
can you call us our intelligent prime minister of India
any stories they might easyly come up with religion, language and community other than that the doesnt have genuine answers
It a great wow.....mashaallah mehdi hassan.amazing interview...u stood a true leader representing the whole srilankan community....
Me is a Sri Lankan, what a shrued &canning person is Ranil Wixkeamasinghe, all present can easily understand this. So people he is the main culprit who ruined Sei Lanka from 1977 , over 48 years, Ranil is giving mere excuses and misleading the public
Thanks Mehdi for exposing this scoundrel. Gonna continue watching your show!
His house and books were burnt in a plot that he created to make himself look like a victim and also to scar the movement of the people
He’s also hitler 😢
Please invite Namal Rajapaksha next time definitely
Questions are all good. But a person should be allowed to answer as well. I felt this is just one-sided.
Ranil W. vs LTTE ☠😡😡😡
LTTE vs Mr Ranil 😂
All together broke my country 🇱🇰
When in school in 80's and 90's I studied Geography. I learned about Sri Lanka and how fertile the land is. A great land with great spiritual history. Gone down . All because of some greedy men.😢
Mr. Ranil Wikramasinghe is the one and only savior for srilanka, Many srilankans cannot understand what he has done, lots of srilankans are blinded by media,Sri lankans are brain washed by media. You will understand when he is gone. I feel so sad for srilankans.
Ranil Rajapaksha - ⛓️🪝🗑️🔫🦯🔗🪠🚽⚰️🪦🏴‍☠‍RIP
As a sri lankan,I respect for the journalist who asked the questions 👍
Topic is something else, questions 😀😀😀, can see lots of ltte supporters are in it , first u should allow him to answer,
This interviewer is so bad. Gets cornered and chnages the subject 😂
Great Al jazeera
මෙන්න මේ බූරුවයි අර මහින්ද කියන බූරුවයි උගෙ පුතයි තමයි ලංකාව කෑවෙ. ගල් ගහල මරන්නෝන බේසික් පුතාලා සේරටම
Ranil was calm and quiet through out the programme.  But as an international media Al Jazeera should be more controlled and calm. Getting angry is not the solution.
Disgusting behaviour from a former president 🤢🤢💩 whatta idiot. Shame of you ranil
What a clown 🤡 Sri Lankan Mr. Bean😅
.  Massacres have taken place in all the lands inhabited by Tamils in Sri Lanka. Massacres have been taking place since Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948 and continue to this day. Mass graves exist in any land inhabited by Tamils. When the graves were dug up, bones, skulls, and clothes were found, and it was identified as the bodies of Tamils. The Sri Lankan government, the Sri Lankan army, and their henchmen brutally murdered Tamils. The Sri Lankan government is building its religious temples on top of today's buried graves. The international community should take note of this.   How many, how many massacres. They are committing genocide by cutting, stabbing, raping, etc. Every massacre is very cruel. They used sharp weapons.  We demand justice. We ask you, the world, to investigate the massacres committed and ongoing by the Sri Lankan government. Listen to the answers given by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe above. Thank you, Aljaseera Mehidi Kasan, for your conversation.
Ranil Rajapaksa - a cunning fox
Love you Al Jazeera
Deva paid by Ranil government. I think he received huge money.
No comment 🤡
He is not elected by the people. He is puppet of Rajapakasa.
This interview has sparked much commotion on Sri Lankan social media sphere, that was not only critical about Ranil Wickremasinghe but also the brand of journalism practiced by both the interviewee and the media organisation he works for.   I am yet to watch the full interview but a number of short clips that are long only one or two minutes that have been circulating on social media, I found to be unimpressive, and if at all, I thought, had, only a value in entertaining rather than in fact finding.  That said in my personal understanding the reasons and roots of Sri Lanka's recent economic crisis runs deep, they are nuanced, and complex, for which many scapegoats have been found except perhaps the real culprits.  It may one day warrants a deep scrutiny in a more academic manner rather than from journalists employed by media organisations, and their shows, whose successes are dependent on popularity and ratings for which various tacts and strategies are used to the extent, that the real essence of journalism is hard to find these days. Well blaming journalists alone would be disingenuous as most professionals and professions seem to have succumbed to a status quo that has jeopardized their integrity and character, which is a more troubling phenomenon than a crisis in a small island inhabted by few millions of people.  Anyway now that I found this clip, looking forward to watching it soon.
Man he got slammed!!
Mehdi is arrogant and  unprofessional. He should allow the president to talk. Sri Lanka's politics and the attitude of people are very complicated. Unless someone lives in that country for many years, it is difficult to understand. It is easy to blame the govt for every think but the common man do not want chaos.
It's quite surprising to see that a 2-hour live program has been cut down to just 40 minutes! I can't help but feel a bit frustrated about it. 🤔😅 It's disappointing, especially considering how much content and discussion could have been included. What could possibly justify such a significant reduction in time? 🖕
Tamil people what happened tell me . ranil?
Go home ranil 😂😂
srilankan coverment kill more then 140000 tamil people
36:18 Ranil's reaction was priceless when Hasan asked about his former boyfriend who were lately killed by Ranil. 😃😄😁
Respect al jazeera.❤
Can this idiots journalist allow others to talk! It is like a child play.. with an anxious tone! Annoying
👌👌👌👌👌❤❤❤👍🫂
Horrible interviewer. This interviewer should not be allowed to interview as his tone is horrible . He is ugly tone cannot stand it just shut up n go
Mr Ranil wikramasingha spoke well 👏 . Medi hassan was very disrespectful 😤..
Ranil rajapaksha..
This is how a crooked culprit is exposed.👌 Sri Lankans know very well what a pathological liar Ranil Wickremesinghe  is. I hope, finally he met his Waterloo! Thank you  Mehdi Hasan and Al  Jazeera.
An interview with Ranil and Al Jazzera is appreciated. Great news and truthful content exposed by asking Al Jazzera interviewers.Thanks veracity of news reports by Al Jazzera.
Next namal rajapaksa
We can see the panic in Ranil's actions and words when Hassan mentioned the Batalanda Commission Report. Chandrika didn't table the report to the parliament to protect their class; the capitalists. What we can clearly see here is the capitalist politicians working together and cooperating to undermine the general public. Ranil was involved in all the incidents mentioned, be it direct or indirect. However his involvement was mostly indirect as he was just issuing orders and pulling the strings behind the curtains. Under the current NPP government, Batalanda Commission Report must be tabled, discussed and justice must be served for the victims of those inhumane torture, who merely wanted a better future for the generations to come.
Please get mahinda rajapsksa
Omg he f*cked uk..can you please interview Mahinda Rajapaksha before he is going to die.
One of the serious mistake ranil made was to request the organisers to provide to photocover this interview at the expense of the organisers without editing the whole interview
Bring the Rajapaksha's !
Sad to see all the srilankan libtards siding with a terrorist news network
Sri Lanka civil war was won by Sinhalese by the help of Indians and other superpowers countries,otherwise Sinhalese could not won the alone against Tamil Tigers
You do not question the USA, Russia, Ukraine,  Why only Sri Lanka that you are afraid of.
When you ordered "Talk with Chamuditha" from TEMU, but it is a real one.
Only  LTTE Tamil Diaspora and Srilankas New Majority NPP Slaves who has a real hatred towards RANIL Find Mehdi Hasan a Hero Journalist.😃. pathetic when you find out His real agenda behind this Dog like Interview and his past interviews and peoples reaction to this Clown
Plse can you invite mahinda rajapaksha
Lots of our politicians are real life demons under a sheap coat...Appreciate Al Jazeera for having real journalists❤
Sri Lanka is doomed
what a clown this Rajpakshi
Ranil Rajapaksha 😂
who protect thief?
My dear brothers and sisters I am innocent boy living in the refugees camps of Kenya, my parents died when I was a kid and my ambition is to became one of the top journalist in the world please help me to fulfill my dreams in Sha Allah.
Was this idiot running your country ?
Srilankan leaders has two different faces. When they come to international community they are the democratic leaders. When they face Tamils they are traitors
Salaam Mr Mehdi. Don't care about the bad comments. U done a good job.😅
Great journalist
useless host. not letting the guest to speak and working on his agenda because he is old and mature. shame on this takloo guy
Mehdi Hasan’s reputation for aggressive, gaslighting interviews is hard to ignore 😡📚. His track record shows that he often interrupts his guests and twists their words to fit his own agenda 🤷‍♂️🔄. This relentless pursuit of control over a conversation isn’t insightful journalism—it’s just hostile and manipulative 😤.
In this interview, Ranil Wickremesinghe tries to give thoughtful, well-explained answers, but Mehdi Hasan’s aggressive interruptions constantly disrupt him. When Ranil criticizes groups like the EU and Amnesty, Mehdi twists his words to suit his narrative. The selective nature of these interruptions—targeting only Ranil and not other panelists—is particularly frustrating. This gaslighting approach prioritizes personal bias over genuine understanding, leaving the debate far from balanced.
I feel like I watched a topnotch comedy show 😂. Ranil f***d up big. If this happened in SL, that journalist will be under 6ft by now..Hats off to this journalist. Ranil may avoid questions as its not his responsibility. But when Karma started to work, he ll never can avoid it. And how many years in the politics, but cannot even organize an answer in a proper way. Shame on you Ranil.
Mehedi Hasan is a not a very smart person, he's basically asking questions a president why he visited foreign nations ! Looks like mehedi have had something against the former president. Explains why he's from 3rd world .
Who broke ranil 😂😂😂 Al Jazeera?
06:36 😂❤
Mr Ranil wickramasinghe is the best politician in the Sri Lanka.. ..  and he was the best president of the world 🌍
රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ ඉල්ලගෙන කැවෙ..
LIE.. you’re not a Buddhist.. you’re representative of the WESTERN CHRISTIAN CULTURE and their countries.. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO Responsible FOR STI LANKA’s Bankruptcy.. Due to The loans you have taken during the Yahalalana era..  you and your westerns masters behind the GOTA GO HOME event. To get ring of Sinhala Buddhist leaders..
Most of the Sri Lankan politicians are corrupt specially this one, but Sri Lankan army didn't fight against Tamil people they fought against a terrorist group who used innocent civilians as human shields if not for them the civil war would still be an ongoing conflict.
Can we expect anything more from a media organization that relies on Tamil diaspora fund ?It is unfortunate that many people forget that this same media outlet produced films that depicted the Sri Lankan Army as a "war crime".
This is how this man who killed 60,000 Sri Lankan youths in 88/89 talks like he is doing nothing.💔
What happened to Jaffna library ? 😂
@aljazeeraenglish Please note this guy and his idiot supporters are making accusations that your interview has been edited and only a part has been released to the media. Hence, please look into this matter and I believe as a reputed media unit, you guys don't want to get the blame from one of the biggest thieves and the most brutal killer for editing interviews.
Wow ..this is amazing ..Ranil met reality
Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhala Buddhist.And we are happy to share our land with kind hearted people no matter what religion 😊
Mehdi never lets anyone finish answer
ටවුකනව දාලා මේන් සම්පුර්ණ එකම දාලා..දැන් කට්ටිය ඇත්ත නැත්ත බලාගන්න මේක translate කරල දාන්න
THIS LANDS BELONGS TO TAMIL'S THEN WHY GIVE IT TO SINHALESE??
As a Sri Lankan I never thought Ranil is a idiot this much
Mehdi Hasan is a sub par journalist, who is a hamad apologist and supports LTTE.  interviewing another sub par individual.
SO SHAME TO SAY 6 TIMES PRESIDENT. BODY FULL OF POISION.🙄🙄🙄👎👎👎
Im really satisfied to see Ranil Wickramisnghe being asked these question in international media. He is being cooked here yes, but tamilians, LTTE wasnt the good side either. Who's going to talk about that ? How the LTTE graped pregnant mothers, cut their belly and took those growing children out , how they cut innocent civilians into pieces. What about war crimes went on from their side. The LTTE isnt 100% clean or fair either.
In October 2018, a constitutional crisis unfolded when President Sirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe from his position as Prime Minister, appointing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place. Wickremesinghe deemed this move unconstitutional and refused to vacate his office, leading to a political standoff. President Sirisena accused Wickremesinghe of corruption during this period, although no formal charges were filed. The crisis persisted until December 2018, when Rajapaksa resigned, and Wickremesinghe was reinstated as Prime Minister.
Millions thanks for Al Jazeera..and plz continue 🎉
A pointless country and pointless people.
This man is behind most of Sri Lanka's Export Processing Zones, places like IET in Katunayake, NAITA, and pretty much the entire vocational training sector in Sri Lanka. He was instrumental in standardizing Sri Lanka's upper secondary education system, modeling it after the UK system (A-Levels and O-Levels). Every time he was in power, inflation rates were stable, and people had adequate food and essential supplies. He achieved all this without executive power, which he only held during his last two years in office. Remarkably, during that time, he managed to pull Sri Lanka out of bankruptcy with the same team from the Rajapaksa side. He had no other option but to work with the existing cabinet, from which shining stars like Kanchana and Ali Sabri emerged. He may have plenty of weaknesses, but compared to other options like Anura, Sajith, or Mahinda, he is undoubtedly the smartest leader of the bunch.
Ranil such a m...f....  Bring another f  Rajapaka also to jazeera 🎉
Exactly what he did was putting the same show back on the road.
Wow what a journalist..at the moment no journalist in Sri Lanka has this kinda courage
Almost 2 hours discussion you people edited to 50 min program. Shame on you Aljazeera.
Can you interview or talk about migrant worker camp in Qatar?
Mehdi is a journalist but he thinks he is expert in everything
That is exactly Mehdi does . He is bullying an experienced politician .
'several hundred people’s died. it’a not that funny' 🥹
Mehidi hassan 🔥🔥 there are more politicians next 😂
This man and the Rajapaksa family pioneered the destruction of the beautiful country called Sri Lanka.😌
Best journalist 👏🏻 👌  Srilanka need this kind of journalist!!❤
The whole world knows Ranil Wickramasinha is a killer..
Questions Asked Well Should Give More Room to Reply  Reply Time was not enough  Just a Real For Al Jazeera to Set Out Things in their papers  This journalist is fast forward  Should be soft running  It was like a 4 hour film in 2 mins No proper time to answer the questions but too many questions in the Paper  Call These people to the table in the future  Madam Chandrika  Mr Mahinda Rajapaksha Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksha  Mr Namal Rajapaksha (in his Dream Future president)
In every interview he had, he asked journalist not to ask these questions if so he leave the interview. A brave journalist
Not a useful interview, constant interruption with topic switches doesn’t actually let us get to truth.  Very much necessary to put politicians on the spot, but gotta go deep on every topic all the way.
மூக்குடைபட்டுக்கொண்டிருக்கிறார் PM
Roasted
Why is this guy so scared of Americans ? When they did so much but never interview them 😅
lol how if he interviews Anura ! 😆
Ranil wickramasingha 💚
2008 දෙසැම්බර් මාසයේදී එවකට ඇමරිකානු තානාපතිනිය වූ රොබට් ඕ බ්ලේක් සමඟ සම්මුඛ සාකච්ඡාවක් පැවැත්වූ තරුණ දක්ෂ ශ්‍රී ලාංකික කාන්තා මාධ්‍යවේදිනියක් ඔබ දැක නැත. ඇය හොඳම තැනැත්තියයි. දැන් පටිගත කිරීම කොහේදැයි සොයා බලා එය නරඹන්න. ඇය ප්‍රභාකානාට සහාය දුන් පුද්ගලයා හොඳින් හසුරුවා ගත්තාය. මම 1974 සිට එක්සත් රාජධානියේ, ශ්‍රී ලංකාවේ, ඕස්ට්‍රේලියාවේ සහ ඇමරිකාවේ රූපවාහිනී සම්මුඛ සාකච්ඡා නරඹා ඇත්තෙමි. මේ අල්ජසීරා හරිම අශෝභනයි!
You did not see the Young Talented Sri Lankan female jounalist interviewing then American Ambasseder, Robert O Blake, in December 2008. She was the best. Find out where the recording is now and watch it. She nicely handled the guy who was supporting Prabakaana. I have seen to TV interviews since 1974 in the UK, Sri Lanaka, Australaui and America. This Aljaseera is rubish!
Actually if you listen in question by question Ranil does answer them well.  It's the interjections that takes away from the clarity of his answer.  Those who know the issues know that if Ranil who was the only person willing to step in to save the economy from what it was (also acknowledged by EU and Mehdi starts with that). Such was possible only if Ranil's focus was not to go on a witch hunt of the Rajapakses but focus on the economy.  I think Ranil should have been truthful that he had to focus on the real task, and let the law look after the other... Infact he says that in a different way.  No question that Ranil was rattled... But with the polished self assurance, wit and sarcasm of Mehdi,  Ranil is no match.  Yet in this interview one thing was clear.  Mehdi was not interested in the answers.  I believe all questions were answered well except Batalanda... Which he may have blood in his hands.  Yet do you recall the time when we wanted to wake without the fear of the JVP taking the law to their hands at the time.  Tapping at doors at night and taking away your identification cards, asking you to switch off lights at night and if you fail facing death etc...  I liked when Ranil said if you want to keep interjecting with questions before I answer one, why not take 10 minutes and ask all your questions and give me 10 minutes un interrupted... He retorts .... I cannot give you 10 minutes to answer each question and ridicules him... When that's not what Ranil asked for.  He was also clearly lost for words when Ranil said prosecution is in the hands of the attorney general.  Not the president.  Mehdi should have been better prepared to calmly ask the question, are you sure the attorney general is not beyond political influence and is aware of repercussions especially when Ranil holds them in high esteem?
Srilankan not politicians right 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was one of the victims displaced from Sri Lanka due to the war. In my lifetime, none of the media personnel have reasonably questioned Sri Lankan politicians in this manner. Most politicians believe they can do anything to succeed in their political careers and maintain their positions by satisfying the majority of Sinhala Buddhist people, while disregarding the concerns of minorities. Even in this modern, globalized society, they fail to understand the importance of humanity. Over 100,000 innocent Tamils in the northeast of Sri Lanka were killed. Sri Lanka gained independence from the British primarily for the Sinhala people, not for minorities.  Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe is a living example of this, and it raises questions about how Tamil people can find solutions within this country.
Bro got distroyed by Ranil
Thanks Al Jazeera
I am Sri Lankan too
To be honest, mehdi hassan like to hear the sound of his own voice...
Tamils are most idiot violent peoples
සිලින්ඩර් බයියෝ සම්පූර්ණයෙන්ම බැලුවද කියලත් අහනවා 😂😂😂😂
Than you very much Al jazera❤❤ he destroyed our dreams .( young crowd of srilanka)
Only the Tamils in the audience are asking the questions. Where are the Sinhalese? By being silent are they not complicit in this whole charade? Sri Lanka is built on a racist foundation and unless the Sinhalese majority dismantle it, expect more of the same.
Best interview ever. Thanks aljazeera..great work!!
Million  thanks   to  Al  Jazeera❤🙏🙏
Royal salute   to   journalist  is  jazeera🙏👌👌👌👌👌
The interviewer is manic & needs a lesson in self-restraint
so you guys need to justify terrorism ?.
Ranil wichremresingha is a devil , criminal, thief
Mehdi, it’s shame on you. You are doing the same as your love piers mogan. Thought you are a good journalist and example for a host in a TV show. But you showed no difference.
Update: Thanks to this interview, the current Sri Lankan government will be tabling the Batalanda report in parliament.. Let's see what Ranil has to say after that..
There’s a huge responsibility on the current government in SL to take actions on the allegations made against Ranil and his supporters. Else Anura will be questioned the same days.
What kind of journalist is this guy !!
19:09   Mr. Ranil shouldn’t use Buddha’s words to dodge the Easter attacks question. It’s a serious issue, and people deserve a clear answer, not a clever story. He needs to face the facts, not act too wise to care.
Mr. Mehdi Hasan, We value the important stories you bring to light.
Mr. Mehdi Hasan Thank you for your insightful interview. Your dedication to uncovering the truth is inspiring. Keep up the great journalism.
The credibility of international media has declined due to biased reporting, lack of independent verification, and agenda-driven narratives. Studies show that up to 80% of news in major outlets is not original, relying on press releases instead of investigative journalism.   Instances like Sky News Australia's misinformation on climate change and the BBC’s biased coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict have further damaged trust. As a result, public confidence in media has significantly dropped, with audiences gravitating towards sources that align with their beliefs. This growing distrust highlights the need for fact-checking and unbiased reporting to restore media credibility.
Maybe ranil think he is like chamudita or hashen .... But mahdi rocking
Since Mehdi interviewed our majority leader I respect this journalist
I'm a Sri Lankan, just started to love AI Jazeera
Bro's cooked so hard 🥲
රනීල්
I am not satisfied with this. The journalist didn’t give enough time to complete the answer, seemed to have cut some parts, and also failed to mention the bombings that targeted Sinhalese civilians by Prabhakaran. Is that fair? Do you realize how many innocent people were killed in attacks on public buses, as well as members of parliament and other officials?  Mahinda is a great leader who put an end to this violence for the sake of all people, not just the Sinhalese. He also protected Tamil civilians. It was Prabhakaran who sought to divide the country, leading to violence. He manipulated and brainwashed Tamil people, using some of them forcibly to attack the South.  Now, you can see how Tamil people live in peace without such issues. That is the result of ending the conflict.
Says bah bah bah naki pakaya 😂
These politicians destroyed sri lanka 😢
some guys talking about human rights  Can’t remember the history
Invite William ruto
As a Srilankan, its so nice to see the politicians so speechless
Thanks lot find kaning gys
Wow mehedi , you done a very good job
No time to answer. WHO is this idiot media person. LTTE??
Thank you so much Al Jazeera ❤  As Sri Lankans we need justice for the bomb explosion and other things happened
As a Sri Lankan, Thanks @Mehdi!
No contest.... No contest.
It was Rajapaksha’s and their supporters who made Ranil the president. It was a long due dream coming true, People have rejected him time and time again cos people know who Ranil is. He couldn’t win a single election for the person who he is.
රනිල්ට කක්කා ගියාද මන්දා 😂
Thank you Al Jazeera ‘’ Ranil Out’’
sorry This Is Sri Lanka I'am <PVT> Vithanaarachchi RP Alert Mother Land
This is just plain and simple disrespect to a statesman.
I literally  hate politics but the comments make me watch this video!
Mr.Hassan thank you very much ❤❤
Why wouldn't Aljazera bring in Mr.Nagananda Kodituwakku for the TRUTH not Ranil Wickremasingha who is a common thief robbing The IMF loans.Bombed houses with His Gas cylinders.
Amazing interview. Finally real journalism!
We Tamil people want independence of Tamil Eelam from Srilanka as repartition not a compassionate words from Sinhalese and Telugu peoples.
Al Jazeera should have asked him why he didn't recognise Tamil Eelam as a independent sovereign country to prevent the Tamil Genocide.
Same type of questions can't be asked to their own governments but easy to question others and feel great questioner or great job doing for this episode
We want to watch a debate between Mehdi Hasan and Shaikh Hasina of Bangladesh.
So dissapointing
Talking about the war, I want to ask Mehdi and that so-called professor lady and the lady in the middle, are you justifying the killings that were done by Tamil tigers in the southern part of the country? Killing Sinhalese? Killing Buddhist monks? Bombings schools? Aren't they brutal same as the easter Sunday bombings? Explain this. Mehdi and AlJazeera, are you justifying these? Need answers.
TamilEelam 🐅🐅🐅
Sri Lankan politicians are corrupt? Yes, true. A lot of political disappearances? Yes, true. But the Sri Lankan army fought against the Tamils? Mehdi, are you crazy? The war was to unite the country. Not against Tamil, it was against a terrorist group. Like the refugee terrorist attacks the UK has experienced recently.
❤❤❤❤
Never seen he is going this much of an agony.. he might have thought the same way Srilankan journalists interview..😅
The man stuttered so much when Medhi presented facts that I thought I was listening to a cartoon.
In the local he seems solid. In the international, he acts like a joker. Mr. Bean Wickramasinghe
5:55 6:26 6:34 7:00 7:21 9:20 11:31 11:56 12:21 17:07 18:05 19:40 23:59 24:10 24:42 26:22 26:40 27:09 27:18 27:50 35:19 37:10 47:15 48:55 >>> these are the funny moments🤣
Hey Mehdi, kindly interview Malaysian leaders about how the Muslim Malays discriminate the non Muslim Malays in Malaysia. Thanks
I am an Indian. I do not have a political opinion. But Mehdi was constantly interrupting and not allowing Mr. Wickramasinghe to complete his answer. While there was definitely human rights abuses when Sri Lanka reclaimed Jaffna,  no one in their right mind can defend that vile hateful terrorist organization LTTE.
See how arrogant former president of Sri Lanka!?  Now only people can understand how covered !
War crime Sri Lanka!
Ranil is facing the situation wisely as a matured politician 👍👍👍
Al Jazeera done a good job interviewing this fool😂😂😂
I am disappointed at constant interruption by Mehdi Hassan. I always held Mehdi to be a great interviewer. But this time he was constantly interrupting.
This interview was a disgrace to journalism. The interviewer was more focused on pushing their own narrative rather than actually listening to the Sri Lankan former President. Instead of an open discussion, it felt like an attempt to force answers that aligned with a predetermined agenda. Journalism should be about fair questioning, not aggressive interrogation. Al Jazeera should seriously reconsider the ethics and professionalism of their journalists
රනිල්ට දුන්නා පුක රත්වෙන්න 😂
35:34 He's being childish🤣🤣🤣
Did any panel members receive funds from USAID ?
Please have such shows on Zeteo also and cover other countries too.
Still, there are ppl  around in the world who represented Prabhakaran ,this looks like channel 9
Ranil is very good in this ❤ we all love srilanka
Ranil wickremesinghe should not have any kind of human rights as a human and to be a human  . All the human rights should be removed from this ranil wickremesinghe , should not give a any single human rights for him live as a human or as a animal . When its come to batalanda ( human sloterying house belong to him ) ranil wickremesinghe and his boyfriend i can say his husband his name was vincent fernando are the main heads there . because all the sri lankans knows ranil wickremesinghe is gay and he is covering his gay life and husbands marrying a lady . When batalanda came out what ranil did he killed his husband giving poison he use the police power to do it .ranil killed lots of educated young peoples and buried them live and almost ded in burning tires in street or some empty lands in sri lanka .  I still remember those dark days and i show it my own eyes i was around 17 or 18 Years that time . Ranil dont  wanted educated young peoples coming leaders in sri lanka  still he is same . Lots of great educated young students  from universitys and journalists doctors lowers engineers  and artists , was killed that time such as richard de zoisa one of the great journalist and artists  .  He is the one who stoled alsomt all the money from the central bank of sri lanka . He is one of the son in lows J.R.Jayawardenas late president of sri lanka and the father who distorted sri lankan economy and the pice between shinales and timles. Ranil is uncle to shiranth rajapaksa ( wife of mahinda rajapkasa Fromer  president ) too.   If you show his eyes in this interview you can see how dangerous he is and how cloud his eyes are. He is a dwell
Al Jazeera TV no need to involve Sri Lankan matter before Sri Lankan Government dissolved all Tiger now old diaspora support to Al Jazeera
Hats off aljazeera 😊😊 this should be translated into sinhala and tamil and should be telecast in all channels in sri lanka..All sri lankans must watch this 🎉
Ranil killed thousands of school students, university students, journalist  and many more He have mental disability he like to watch cruel activities
Can you also invite Anura next time? Oh please also send along a translator for him 😂
Killar
Rajapaksas also must face this kind of a program !!
You forgot to ask about being the mastermind of robbing the central bank out of treasury bonds
Ranil: I was in politics before you were born Mehdi:  Yes. i think that is the PROBLEM :).     OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!
Sri Lankan journalists do not know how to ask tough questions from their political leaders..... I think Ranil got caught out badly..... he is not used to smart and tough journalists like this. He is an educated man but he sounded like a grade 2 kid in this.  Sri Lankan politicians need to be trained in how to answer journalists in a clever and civilised way.... this was embarassing.
Bear in mind, Al Jazeera did not do this out of the kindness of their heart. Ranil is a corrupt culprit who must be punished, but these people have their own agenda—I see separatism written all over their faces.  Dont be fooled by these people.
This is a bad interview. It's not dialogue, it's interrogation. Regardless of this man's conduct, this is an embarrassment to journalism, it's way to aggressive and he lost composure. He could have achieved the same goal, with composure.
The reason of Ranil loosing the  election was nothing to do with Ranil. It was democracy in  Sri Lanka. People wanted to chose someone. Sri Lanka is not a Qatar state. Sri Lanka is democratic state and is independent country.
Ranil is the only man in the Sri Lankan politics, who can standing up to this kind of questing. He is the only person who can successfully answer to all those questions. I have a huge respect though I'm independent person.
No contest - Kaju Seeya
the way he dragged buddhism in to this with his mouth disgusting 19:20
No wonder how angry Tamils are listening to such snakey pathetic ethnic cleansers
*_The stupidity of one of the Sri Lankan Politician who destroyed and protected the gang of the thieving family._*
😂😂 this dude wanted a fist fight with the PM lol
if you have enough brain not hatered you will find that Ranil managed well against a  born English speaker...
Ranil Kuruma
The hunning leader ever in Sri  Lankan politics,,,,
Where is  the money?????
Im not suprissed aljazeera become a ltte channel and they taking lots of money from tamil daispora exactly sorry aljazeera.
Great interview. I’d love to see you interview Mr Modi and other Asian heads of state, past and present.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great 👍
Just because someone is your political opponent doesn’t mean they’re your enemy. In a healthy democracy, people can have different views but still respect each other. Attending personal events like birthdays or weddings shouldn’t be a big deal—it just shows basic human decency.  Unfortunately, in some political cultures, people see opponents as enemies and expect strict separation. But real leadership is about rising above that. Many great politicians have maintained personal friendships across party lines. It’s about knowing when to debate and when to be civil.
Ranil boss got chocked so hard that he couldn't spit any words
ado boru hiru learn from Al jazeera how to conduct an interview
Is it okay to distrupt someone in the middle of speaking?? Idk why the interviewer  is doing that??
Look how big of a joker he is.. where is his class, where is his education, where is his culture and all the bull his henchmen were and are exaggerating all the time.
Where is modi hiding, mehdi catch him
❤️🇮🇳👍
The choice of words he has chosen clearly exposed Ranil's intention of avoiding justice, ethnic crisis, land grabbing, encroaching. And Callum Macrae's question in comparison with Gaza was great, the Ranil failed in the justice process and it sets an example for another war crimes in different part of the world.
Thank you for asking Ranil about Batalanda...Ranil is a murderer who killed thousands of people.
I dont like Ranil. He ruined the country that what the majority of Sri Lankans think. But could you please let him speak?
Even ranil cant speak good english 😂
Ranil is a murderer and a corrupted politician
He do great job for Sri Lanka really.... Some people want sri lanka to be Bangladesh but he do good job for he's people ❤
He telling lies they all are corrupted people.
I love what mr ranil w say ❤️
Bring in Namal Rajapaksa to get grilled
what a stupid jounalist ! he just wants to talk and noit let the guest talk. STFU and listen hassaan idiot
Real journalists ❤❤
45:58 ...
Invite basil next time!
Ranil is the best leader even if people don't like him.
Please invite current president, He will explain everything for the world with facts,,,,
It's true that Ranil Wickramasinghe is a corrupt politician, He should be punished and ashamed of his past. Yet during this interview ,it's clear that Al Jazeera also had an agenda to promote LTTE terrorist agenda. We should oppose this type of bad media behavior as well. This looks like a biased and one sided interview.
The historical murder of the Sri Lanka is RW !
Anyway there is not a single chance for LTTE in the island of Sri Lanka. No chance for any terrorist group, our government wiped out from the land and north and south were connected, we live freely. No more child suicide bombers, our government made sure people are free from all that. If you come to the island you all can see our Tamil brothers and sisters doing their business in west, south and east. One country one nation
Fifty minutes wasted listening to another genocidal apologist repeatedly failing to address the questions. Defended only by a scummy Tory. 🤮
I am going to watch this again with some pop corn.
For the whole time he was clearly avoiding the questions saying the same thing. Good to  see them getting humiliated in front of everyone
No contest. because ranil rajapaksha like a Gandhi
Most of our tamil brothers migrated to abroad due to this political games. We lost very valuable persons due to these issues
"Thank you for your story about the Buddha".  Brilliant.
As a Sri Lankan, I respect and thank the journalist.
Sri Lankans are responsible for their problems. Rajapaksa family's power went unchecked so long.
What a third class journalist
What a political statement. The stage, the manner, and the final message. This what they call "international job". I'm still wondering how Ranil pulled this off. Pure skill. Kudos 👏
This is the first time in Sri lankan history Ranil Wickramasinghe alias founder of Batalanda torture camps where thousands and thousands of youth were killed after brutally touturing, whose suit was stripped and showed his real body to the world. Thank you very much Medhi Hassan and Al Jaseera.
Thank you Aljazeera. Next time please interview Mahinda Rajapaksha 'Big Thief' of Sri Lanka
11:38 In Sri Lanka " mun okkoma yaluwo malli"😂
Ranil reminds me of my father. "Where is the report? Where is the report?"
Most of them try to blame sri lanka . Well done. Sri Lankan Lion Mr Ranil. One man show. Well handled. Proud of you ❤️
See the mimic of wikramasinghe when the questioner make the comparison to Palestine -- smile of proudness get bigger- what do you read from the mimic min 43.30? Is it not a villain smile?
Invite AKD to discuss the matters in detail
Thank you Al Kaseera❤
Respect Al Jazeera ❤
What is this in the first place? It's more like two patients suffering from dementia. Medi interrupts Ranil as he is going to forget what he gonna talk next, and in the other hand Ranil trying to answer before he forget what he gonna say.We can see that Ranil was unable to answer accurately for medis questions. But still, Medi Cornering Ranil like that and trying to dominate the conversation is very disrespectful as an interviewer. He put Ranil in a position to hold accountable for the past actions and the crisis. Though Medi was prolonged to prove that Ranil was guilty by not letting him speak sure, he did get offended. But with this behaviour of the interviewer, although it was a setup, the interviewer was able to checkmate Ranil in some questions, which he was unable to answer, maybe because of the guilt. But still, he could have done it in a well-mannered way by letting him answer questions. Arguing about his answer and making a point is okay, but interrupting is not okay. When Ranil said, " if I'm gonna dance to your tune, he is prepared to leave,"Medi replied, "You fly here for that" yet he didn’t fly to hear him yapping and interrupting just sitting down.
Just to make this clear, we majority of Sinhalese Buddhists and our Tamil and Muslim brothers do not represent this figure as our Srilankan representation to the world..He is no less crooked than the Rajapaksha regime..
Ranil hit that Buddha line thinking it was a guaranteed KO walkoff mic drop and it bounced off Mehdi like water of a ducks back
Mehdi he supports Muslim extremists like you 1 your side did Easter hombings mehdi so be nicer you fake
Where is the UN now? @beholdisraelchannel
The man who broke the country 💔
Thank you so much Al Jazeera❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mr. Hassan, Sri Lankan people are thanking you for this interview. Respect!

BRING THE RAJAPAKSES ! MAKE THIS A SERIES.
Very childish for a ex prime minister
We really appreciate Mr.Mahadi asking nice questions from Ranil Rajapake
Never mess with Mehdi Hasan. I knew Ranil will be Fish up big time
Endia is to blame
Why he is shouting

Great leader ranil ❤️
He is also one of the person of corruption with the central bank as well as genocide , he must go to prison.
He cannot speak English very well.i though this Colombo 7 guy can speak multiple languages..he is a clown 😂
Well very smart interview, Al Jazeera🫡
Always giving the wrong answers 😅 it was painful to watch 😂
THANK YOU SOO MUCH AL JAZEERA.
Ranil only brought disgrace to our country evading all the questions asked by the Spokesman, he acted like a Clown .😂😂😂 .
So, according to them, muslim terrorists attacked churches to bring a Sinhalese to the presidency. Do you believe this nonsense ? From where did he plucked the number 53%?
Batalanda never would've Happen if JVP didn't tried to grab power by a Armed Revolution , an Armed Revolution against the State is an act of Terrorism , Then UNP Government reacted to that  Terrorist Group to Protect their Democratic and Constitutional mandate
Words cannot express how thankful I am, AL JAZEERA MEDIA TEAM 🤍🖤🤍
Real journalist 😂😂😂😂😂😂 A person who wants to make an one man show, by keeping a person on the stage and full of audience who are against him is a Real journalist....???😅😅😅😅😅😅
Can you please invite Pakistani fake PM Shebaz Sharif and ask him about political oppression of opposition party and open fire on unarmed citizens or steal elections ? Thanks 🙏

Mr Ranil clearly avoided all the crucial questions.   He just made a fool out of himself by dismissing hard facts by the panelists & Mehdi 😂  I hope Marwan Attappattu is safe 😂
ලන්කාවේ උන්ගෙන් හූවක් ඕනෙ 😂❤🇱🇰
My hats off to Al Jazeera for unfolding the nudity of the sordid, dubious personalities that had been disguising as good Samaritans until very recently!  We need more of this kind of journalism and journalists who doesn't kowtow to the politicians and instead fearlessly uncover their subterfuge nature!  Imagine the state of a country where these kind of elitist rogues had gained the very top positions of governance and been enjoying the sheer comfort of impunity for the monumental crimes they perpetrated?
Thank u so much Al jazeera u guys did a great job 💗 thanks again for mr.imran aljazeera journalist
As a Sri Lankan.. I truly hope this interview is translated or dubbed into Sinhala so that the 'Lankan Majority' of this ethnocracy understand the sufferings of all minorities in Sri Lanka - Eventhough, I highly doubt it would sink into their thick heads!
FYI LTTE terrorist used Northern people as their shield. They used hospitals to get cover from SL army attacks. Thats the truth and no one got balls to speak about that.
People who asked questions never asked about people who suffered from this war. Majority of them were tamils but there were bombing all around the country major attacks were on Sinhalese. No one asked questions about their justice. I do agree with people here, Ranil and co should penalized but program should be balance and transparence. Tamils are not only who got suffered from this and they are not different breed either. Shame on you
Might go underground?
You are not a professional journalist , you should study journalism(manners).
Al Jazeera respect❤
He is a murderer he must go to jail
Great interview ❤ and great journalist
Nowaday silinder baiya so aggressive with al jazeera
About war crimes, why not question the western governments too?.That part is questionable.
we need rajapaksha on this interview
Ranil is a big liar, This fozzile deserves,,,,,
He has no remorse!!!
Question Namal Rajapakse,That will be fun too.
As a Srilankan, i need to say . Thank you Al jazeera
Al Jazeera always attacked Sri Lanka, nothing but a supporter of terrorism against SL
Even Ranil can't speak English . I thought he was an Englishman 😂😂
JOBLESS MAHDI DIGGING OLD GRAVES STINKY
Ranil is murder
please Interview someone from Rajapaksha famliy they destroyed srilanka
Please Blame Israel for srilankan failire, Mehdi hassan will give you a dollor for free with licking grattitude 😅
bunch of people bullying an old man just because he didn't punish Mahinda Rajapakshe, the biggest enemy of the Tamil Eelam. So sure that this interview made many tamil tiger supporters wet. Try harder but you won't make any change and let me remind you something, you people are just a bunch of AHoles without a country.
Epic ending blow... I will be watching Al Jazeera hope that you will be better mannered
Haven't any of these crooks seen mehdi interview other crooks? They still take the bait. I love it😂
Excellent question... thank you AL jasera...  Great media...
The interviewer should have let Ranil finish his answers/give his answers properly- then only we could have judged what is right and what is wrong based on facts/reports. This was a very poorly done interview.
Hahahaha al jazeera why are you deleting comments that are criticizing your journalist & this interview. And why are you deleting comments which are clearly showcasing the real truth behind this agenda? . You guys are deleting comments that are not supporting to you. This has happened to many commentators now. Clear bias journalism with hidden agendas.
Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world.non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is the eternal law.  The above Dhammapada by Buddhist teachings was interpreted by late former president JR Jayawardana of SL to Japan and many of the peace conference were amazed and had great respect. Compare former MP Ranils  Buddhist story and the body language, shows childish character and no sense to the question asked by the journalist. Ranil should have learnt from his late uncle JR Jayawardana how to face a professional interview like this
Can you not bring Nethanayahu to head2head .
As always and not surprisingly, Mehdi Hassan is again impolite, arrogant, and disrespectful, not letting his esteemed guests finish their points. His insolence makes these interviews unbearable to watch.
🤣🤣🤣
Mehdi should interview former US presidents and tony blair abt war crimes what they do in middle east, only bully asian countries
35:13, the inhumance and the sadism in his face speaks in volumes 😮
Absolutely.. bunch of muppets headed by a joker
This is the level of journalism we need in Sri Lanka! Hats off AL Jazeera
Dear presenter hasan , you are a hero now in sri lanka just because you showed what does mean what does sense of media. Excellent you and al jazeera thanks for questioning like this from this f*ng d*g... love from sri l🇱🇰
Ranil plese show your  B.C  to us then we can find  are your a buddist or catholic
I'm pro AKD but in war time there are two parties that I think both parties cannot be justified if those days didn't get strict choices there will be no srilanka if some one use war to get personal gain then it is wrong but... Other way if again war is war there are a war then casualties is unavoidable
Raniel dont tell lie you are a catholic Jesus will panish you
The argument is all about Tamil people's rights. this is hilarious. all people should live peacefully.
just because someone's English is a little bad, doesn't mean you won a debate with him
Great interview as always Medhi, but definitely take Nirj Deva's advice and bring the real perpetrators here. Would love to see you interview the war criminal Rajapaksas.
He’s a terrorist
This interview is a clear example of biased journalism. Right from the beginning, the host refers to the Tamil Tigers as an "armed separatist group" instead of what they truly were—a ruthless terrorist organization that waged war against Sri Lanka for over 30 years, killing thousands of innocent civilians. How can a so-called international media outlet downplay terrorism like this?  It is obvious that this interview was pre-planned to put Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe in an uncomfortable position rather than discussing Sri Lanka’s economic crisis—the supposed topic of the program. Just look at the title: "Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crisis?" Yet, how many questions were actually about the economic crisis? Instead, the host kept pushing questions about the war, Sri Lanka’s military, and even the Easter Sunday bombings—cases still under legal proceedings.  And let’s not ignore the panel members—many of whom have clear ties to the Tamil diaspora groups that continue to glorify the LTTE. Is this a fair discussion, or just another attempt to rewrite history and portray terrorists as victims?  Then comes the host’s disrespectful tone toward Mr. Wickremesinghe, a former president and current leader of Sri Lanka. Is this how international media treats world leaders? The host even mocked Mr. Wickremesinghe’s various roles in government—completely ignoring the fact that he successfully rescued Sri Lanka from an economic collapse within two years.  The most ridiculous part was the host questioning why Mr. Wickremesinghe used power to restore order when violent mobs burned down government buildings, including his own residence. What was he supposed to do? Let the chaos continue? Let them burn down Parliament? This question alone proves the agenda behind this so-called interview.  And the silliest argument? Criticizing Mr. Wickremesinghe for attending the funerals of Queen Elizabeth II and the Japanese Prime Minister. How does that relate to Sri Lanka’s election funding in 2023? These events happened in 2022, and attending them was a diplomatic duty. Does this journalist even understand how international relations work?  Finally, the most laughable question—why did Mr. Wickremesinghe attend Mahinda Rajapaksa’s birthday party? Seriously? Since when is it a crime for two politicians to attend social events? Does this host think political opponents must be enemies for life?  It’s clear as day: this wasn’t journalism—it was an agenda-driven attempt to attack Sri Lanka, distort history, and create controversy where there is none. Al Jazeera should be ashamed of allowing such unprofessional, misleading, and disgraceful reporting…
45:59 🔥🔥🔥
Its remake Director shanker's "muthalvan" film. Raguvaran is their 😂
37:43 🎉
27:00😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aljezeera. . Hats off  for the mind blowing interview with a Srilankan politician. If a Srilankan channel had come forward to do this interview the channel would have got disappeared in no time. Why dnt you try the Rajapakses on stage ? Well Done Aljezeera. . . . Proud of you . I'm from Sri lanka. . .
😮 im shocked but not surprised by a former president's complete negligence of accountability...  So glad we at least havd a fresh government.. Aragalayata Jaya!    May the innocent dead forgive him!  May
All the Sri Lankans are thankful to Aljazeera for exposing this clown
Shame on u Ranil ,,, you are a waste person !!!
Ranil is a Murderer ..
What a $cumbag Mehdi Hassan is! All he does is talk over people.
He is the most idiotic President who did not have the mandate. He is a born conspirator like his father...Never listen to any fair requests...Anti democrat ....bogus personality promoted by uncles and juntas of the media....Shameless person who should be penalised forthwith...
And who gave you the moral authority to ask people questions Hasan? I mean you are fcng two cent Hamas terrorist. You should be the one who should be questioned.
This interviewer is unfair. Doesn't give the chance for the interviewee to answer. He shouldn't be interviewing as he is temperamental and loses his temper which is so disgusting. Al Jazeera, kindly note.
This was a very biased interview, and all pro LTTE ex support were there...I am not  a fan of Ranil. however, he was interrupted with  so many questions before answering one...
Hats off to this Journalist 🙏
So, no one is taking responsibility for the tragedy that happened in Sri Lanka? Not the president, not the prime minister, and the people in parliament have no idea about what's going on. Are we a joke to them? If they can't take responsibility, why did they even seek leadership positions? After watching this, I have so many doubts about the current government's actions. Are we being blindfolded again?
Love you ranil wickramasinghe Because of him we survived
This is the game he has been playing all this time; never taking the responsibility of the injustice happened under their governance/ authority, answering the burning questions of the people with kindergarten level jokes or laughing them off, dragging a total unnecessary Buddhist quote or a irrelevant piece of history or simply walking off from where he's being questioned. They think they are above the law and justice of the country and done so much damage to the country for all those years he has been in politics. We are hopeful the justice is served before they kick the bucket.
everyone talking about the Tamils who were killed in North, no one talks about the ones who were killed in the South
😂😂😂 I'm really happy😂😂. Finally someone interviewed ranil in the right way
Finally🎉
In Sri Lanka some major Media channels runs by politicians , drug dealers and smugglers, and they all protected these corrupted politicians. Here he faces real journalist and dusted.
really good and tough questions that must be raised. and from my pov RW also handled it really well maintaining the composure in such a tough atmosphere where everybody there was trying to get him. true political maturity. pity he didn't use it much to build our country.
You have mehdi Hasan, We have Chamuditha.
Great question mahdi hasan
Please invite mr mahinda too
Everyone seems to worry about Tamil human rights, but no one cares about the Sinhalese people murdered by the LTTE, a terrorist organization. Oh wait, this is Al Jazeera’s audience—so that explains it. 🤣 I personally don’t like Wickremesinghe, but this coverage is clearly biased toward Tamils. The LTTE killed thousands of innocent civilians with bombings and even used their own Tamil people as human shields. Both sides lost people, but for the outside world, it’s just a topic, and for the Tamil diaspora, it’s a funding opportunity! By the way, Wickremesinghe could have handled this interview better, but he kind of let our nation down!
I have no clue about what is going to to that country, but this interview shows this guy is a scam😢
Evil eyes and sinister smile
In my opinion it is very unprofessional the way this interview was conducted.  Afterall Mr Wickramasinghe was a head of state, when interview it is important to be respectful.  The job of the journalists is to be calm and get to the bottom of the key issues.  I think this journalists need to grow up.
From left right center ranil got pinched
Strongest dispora in the world is UK. Shameful.
Thank you for conducting a real interview and exposing one of the worst dictators in Sri Lanka
GREAT MR. MEHDI HASSAN!! and THANK YOU for Exploring a Criminal.
This journalist is a diaspora supporter
2025/03/10
We Sinhalese will never allow our country to be divided.🫵🦁
Mehdi hassan❤
Dhanukaprabodha, as I think you are really lower than even a preschool child in brain and thinking. It is tue that our army won the war.Our blessing for them for that. But that army was given orders by the president (Mahinda Rajapaksha)and the secretary of defence(Gotabhaya Rajapaksha).Prabhakaran also did the same thing. He never came to the front line with a weapon and fought face to face with our army. He ordered his people to fight against our army hidden in an underground bunker located in the Mullativu jungle. We should never be ungrateful and hypocritic.
Ranil is a cold blood murderer
Head to balls 😂😂
Bunkum set up interview.
Ranil is a crook. Ask him about murder camps at Batalanda.  Ranil was laughing at certain press conferences during Easter Sunday bombs.
39:22 Is this guy asking for a separate state for the tamils again? 😂 Does he want everything to happen again?
Al jazzera I thank you to for voice you raise up for the lankans who suffer from people like this wh destroy the country and laughing
😂
Mehdi Hasan, please interview sheikh hasina 🙏
Big fat lier Ranil
Well done Ranil.  Sri Lanka is proud of you.  If the edited version is this, I can imagine the unedited one.  Ranil must have put Hassan in his place.

Well Done MrMahide  Hasan  You're  Great .
As a srilankan i want to say thank you al jazeera team. Well done 🎉🎉🎉
Head to head got his pants wet.
Real journalist,
He faced a real interview in his life. Unlike SRI LANKA the question paper is out and prepared.
Please do Modi
What bullshit question is this journalist?
Why would a dictatorship county want to talk about democratic country, stop this joke. Instead try to help dying Muslim Palestinians,
From now onwards Mehedi Hasan will be my favorite journalist who has a back bone to question this culprit Ranil.....love from Sri Lanka❤❤❤Thabk you Mr. Mehedi for pin point him which none of anyother journalist couldnt do so far.Respect
NOT ONLY TAMIL PERSON BUT ALSO SINHALEES PERSON ALSO DIED. PLEASE CONSIDER , LTTE IS A TERRORISM.
😂😂
Respect Al Jazeera for trying to prove this evil man's real face....love from Sri Lanka
I can see a bunch of terrorists in the audience who lost all 😅
Mehdi Hasan was amazing 🔥
whole srilankan government is 🤡
Shame of Ranils childish act 😡😡😡
Sri Lanka🇱🇰 ❤ Israel🇮🇱 ❤️  Al Jazeera 💩💩💩💩🤮🤮
Beside Ranil's corruption, complete failure to get control of situations and leading country to failure, not been asked difficult questions, or not having clear answers to ANY of the questions, this is an utterly ugly example of modern day journalism. Mehdi is bullish towards the interviewee, topping his own questions multiple times, continuously interrupting, without giving a chance even to complete a sentence. They come with an agenda to 'expose' 'war crimes' done by 3rd world countries, grill the powerless countries until they get the answer they wanted. I would invite you to also also talk about the damage done by LTTE, or better yet question Trump, Obama or Tony Brair using the same tone! What a disgraceful display.
Want to see Modi
Not a single journalist in Sri Lanka, was brave enough to question RW about 88/89 period.
One of our leaders was humiliated on the international stage. We should not be happy with that. Mehdi says he was not even born when Ranil was a politician. That means he was child when Ranil was a senior politician. Then called our leader’s behaviour “childish”. How insulting. It’s like Mehdi had applied Sharia law on Ranil.  Sharia law punishments are stoning, public caning etc. of course Ranil got some tongue lashing from Mehdi. Ranil might have saved Rajapaksas from the electric chair, he might have committed war crimes himself. He might have tortured his own people. Put him in prison and throw away the keys but humiliating and insulting him on the international stage is not right. Ranil said he spoke about the Mahanayake in the juicy bit of the interview that has been edited out. Talking to people who were in the audience confirmed that he was lying to Sri Lankan media. Poor guy is struggling for breadth and trying to use “Buddhism” and “LTTE” cards. Shameful of course but he is only human. During the interview Mehdi looks really puzzled and shocked. May be he was wondering whether Ranil had some mental issues.
Wow what an inarticulate babbling dismissive tone and lack of respect shown by Rajapakse for rhe thoroughly research questions
I am not a Ranil fan! But this whole interview had a hidden agenda behind it to label Sri Lanka as a country where war crimes happened only towards a one particular ethnicity ! Don't even try us Aljazeera!!! World already knows the truth!!! In the past Channel 4 tried the same! Why have you never mentioned about the damages that LTTE did to our religious places like "Temple of the tooth", Aranthalawa monk massacre, Kabithigollawa clamo bomb attack where a crowded civilian bus was destroyed with people, suicidal bomb attacks on two schools in the south aiming innocent children! Why do you always focus on one ethnic group in Sri Lanka that doesn't represent the whole Sri Lankan population! We all suffered!!!!
If you’re here reading the comments, take a moment to read this as well.  I was born in Sri Lanka in 1994 and grew up in a culturally diverse environment shaped by Sinhala, Tamil, Portuguese, Dutch, English, French, and many other influences. I was educated in a system where I learned Sinhala, Tamil, and English. This exposure to different languages and beliefs taught me never to hate others based on their backgrounds. Instead, I choose to speak my mind when necessary and share my thoughts openly.  I am writing this because I question the true motives behind media outlets like Al Jazeera. Do they genuinely care about the Sri Lankan people? Do they love us? Do they truly want to support Sri Lanka? From what I see, their focus seems to be on targeting audiences who oppose certain political figures, stirring division, and potentially pushing the country back into the instability it endured a decade ago.  Growing up in Sri Lanka, I witnessed the impact of war firsthand. It took lives on both sides—Sinhala-speaking and Tamil-speaking alike. No war is fought with one hand clapping, and it is never a one-sided tragedy. As a citizen, I never wanted war, and I don’t believe any ethnic group wished for it either. It was the result of political power struggles, not the will of ordinary people.  Yet, international media often frames the narrative to portray only one side as victims and the other as aggressors. They highlight allegations of war crimes by the Sri Lankan military while ignoring the reality that many Tamil civilians actively supported and funded the LTTE, fueling the conflict. I rarely see discussions about the Sinhala civilians who also suffered, who were displaced, attacked, and killed.  Now, in 2025, I look back and remember that what was lost were human lives—not just Sinhala lives, not just Tamil lives, but human lives. And yet, some media outlets continue to sensationalize the past, reigniting divisions instead of helping people move forward.  Living in Canada now, I see how Sinhala-speaking people are often viewed differently due to narratives pushed by LTTE-supported media and politicians. I recognize that many Tamil people went through extreme brutality in Sri Lanka, as well as Sinhalese civilians. I acknowledge their suffering. But I also believe that distorting history and using selective narratives to demonize one side while glorifying the other does not serve justice—it only fuels further division.  I have many friends who are Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, and atheist, and I was never raised to look at people based on their religious or ethnic identities. My values have always been driven by love and respect, not by the need to prove one belief superior to another.  Now, I see Al Jazeera bringing up the Easter bomb attack in Sri Lanka, clearly trying to manipulate emotions and take advantage of the pain it caused. I don’t need foreign media to remind me of that tragedy, and I certainly don’t need them using it to serve their own narratives. If they truly cared about Sri Lanka, they would approach these discussions with honesty, balance, and a genuine desire to help—rather than using selective storytelling to fuel agendas.  If they truly want to help Sri Lankan people, they need to look at the bigger picture rather than taking sides. War should not be about picking a winner and a loser; it should be about ending suffering. Whenever there is war, I believe it is important to look at the full picture rather than being blinded by emotions  and in the end, what is truly lost are the people we love.  I want to make it clear that I am not fighting for Sinhala people, Tamil people, or defending the Sri Lankan Army. What I’m speaking up about is how the media, particularly in this interview, tends to focus on only one side of the conflict. When the Sri Lankan Army is discussed in the context of brutality, it can easily be perceived as a broader attack on the majority Sinhala-speaking people. That’s the nature of this type of coverage—it often unintentionally extends the focus to the entire community, even when that was not the intent.  I understand that this interview addresses serious allegations against the Sri Lankan Army, but when the discussion is framed in this way, it risks oversimplifying a complex and painful history. This only fuels further division. The truth is that the war cost lives on both sides—Sinhala-speaking and Tamil-speaking alike. No war is fought with one hand clapping; it’s never just one side that suffers. It’s a tragedy that affected all people, regardless of their ethnic background.  I fully acknowledge and respect the extreme brutality that many Tamil people faced during the conflict, and I honor their suffering. I recognize that the pain and loss they experienced is very real and significant. However, I also believe that distorting history and using selective narratives to demonize one side while glorifying the other only fuels further division. It does not serve justice—it hinders it.  Additionally, I believe that the Sri Lankan government must take the necessary steps to help locate those who have been lost during the conflict, regardless of their ethnic background. Both Tamil and Sinhala-speaking people have experienced the pain of missing loved ones, and it is critical that the government take action to address this issue and bring closure to families who still mourn their loss.  I am a Sinhala-speaking person because that is the language I grew up with. But don’t marginalize me as just Sinhala, Sri Lankan, or anything else. There is more to me than those labels. At the core, I am a reflection of you. You are a reflection of me. If people truly want to find common ground, they must first explore themselves and recognize that, beyond all beliefs, we are humans. We are creatures of God, energy, or whatever force one chooses to believe in. We all belong to this planet, and that is our true home.
Terrorist Channel
🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Million thanks to Al Jazeera.... you voiced crying hearts of millions of Sri Lankan who have been waiting for justice for decades. THANK YOU.
Always try to cover behind Buddhism
pleast don't invite mithripala sirisena🙏🙏 if you invite him al jazeera becomes a comedy program😂😂
First step towards awareness
Ridiculous interview. The host kept interrupting the guest. And gets schooled when the guest did get a chance to speak. What a giant waste of time.
Ranil Wickramasinghe belongs in prison.
Unbelievable! That this man held high offices in Sri Lanka for multiple times .........Unimpressive
Accountability is missing, what ever reasons are.
Well done, Mehdi! Unfortunately, we Sri Lankans know that the Rajapaksas will never be punished or face trial. Regardless of whether it’s Ranil or the current government, they all protect each other and cover up wrongdoing.  The events of 2022 showed how united Sri Lankans can be, regardless of religion.  Perhaps only when the people are fed up once again and another massive protest erupts will we see these politicians finally brought to justice.
Hasan කොටි diaspora s representative 😂😂
Ranil wickramasinghe doesn’t care about innocent people at all , I know this person, he is a fox 🦊  those people should responsible for down fall of Sri Lanka
Ranil always avoids questions in SL. He thought it would be the same here
What a scripted head to head all the audiance is reading questions out of papers proberbly given by aljazeera beforehand. 2 out of 3 panel members are all about down playing the terrorist actions done by LTTE its all about war crimes done by the winning side? What about ltte using children to carry bombs or suisude bombers at schools hours in colombo. LTTE is a terririst group lets not forget that. Comparing Ltte terrorist group to a world recognized hamas is just purely wrong on many levels. War is not easy to win i think most people living in the country are doing much better than before. I think many tamils living abroad still wants LTTE back which is just purely utterly disgusting.
Good news al jazeera❤❤❤
This  journalist is so disrespectful...
Thaks former president ranil Wikramasinghe  for saving our country!අනුර kumara with කොටි diaspora that's why North people voted majority 😢😢
I am muslim , u should be shame to call urself muslim, questioning Sri Lanka which fought war. Question abt gaza and ur uk government helping the genocide on Gaza.
Kindly invite Arab and African leaders
What's wrong going to birthday party? They must be relatives. Keep personal connections and politics serpetate please
Ranil wickramasingha liar ana idiot
Ok,,get back to the question 😂😂😂
Please invite namal rajapakshe next ..its gonna get trending number 1
As Sri Lankans, the truth should be told, and there should be accountability for our actions. What was demonstrated in this head-to-head interview shows that we have not learned from our past mistakes to change our image in the eyes of the world. This is sad to acknowledge, but not all Sri Lankans are the same. We are a nation known for our smiles, yet our past brings more sorrow and tears. A change is needed, and we are willing to change.
Zero credibility = Al Jazeera
What about the all the atrocities the LTTE committed?? War is not unilateral, both sides are guilty of humanitarian crimes.  He is the only guy that tried to broker a 2 state solution.
What a clown Ranil I never seen like this clown before who is this clown bro looks like a mr bean 🤡
What a clown 🤡
Mehdi Hasan brother you gained everyone’s respect ma man❤️🫶🏻💯
Old is not gold 😂😂😂😂
No worries, Al Jazeera will never interview the JVPers and question about their terrorist past.
Ask a question, refuse to let the man talk, throw a tantrum when he's not giving you the answer you wanted. Journalism 101 🤣
Ranil rajapaksa is going off his head.. Yes Sir. What a shame!🇱🇰
Mr Hassan Aljaseera supper interview
I just now finished watching that Kenyan president's session with Hasan . He was managing the session better than our clown 😂😂
Bro this isn't " Talk with Chamuditha "..😂
රට ගැන ප්‍රශ්නයක් අහනවනම් මුගෙන් අහල වැඩක් නෑ. මූ නිකම් පබයෙක් විතරයි. කිසි ජන්දයක් නැති. මූ කියන කිසි දෙයක් රටට බලපාන්නෑ 😂
Thank you, Mehdi. If it’s a Sri Lankan journalist, they’ll likely praise him despite his war crimes and corruption
One of the worst interviewers granted the former president did avoid and deflect answers when convenient. When a question is asked allow an uninterrupted answer at-least for a minute before rebuttal. This is the mockingbird style media reporting and questions where the loudest voice appears to have won the debate And an interview is not a debate but a journey of discovery of the interviewee and the revelation of truths. This joker of a so called journalist is from the leftist propaganda machine.
Well said Mr. President 🙏 Thank you for saving Sri Lanka  Announcer doesn't want to listen to RW's answer or he doesn't have the intelligence to understand. Very nice try... But don't bother... Sri Lanka won't be another Bangladesh because we have intelligent leaders like Mr. Wickramasinghe.
He is not puthaa thelungu Nayakkar
Ranil took it personally all Mr.mehadi  Hassan questions.  Ranil is guilty of protecting raja pasha family.
We cannot forget that all university students how they protested during Ranil's time. The Slogans were Batalanda Killer (Ranil).  Central Bank Robber. University students do not protest for nothing. They are our Brain and Future. Did Ranil ever had a sympathy on them. No, Some students died due to the protests. Police and STF during that time attracted the students with tear Gas, dirty water from Bare Tank, Water guns, Rubber bullets, Batten Charges and many more even after taken them to Police stations.  Are they protesting now? NO, NPP increased their allowances and scholarship funds. Did Ranil ever increased the Mahapola or any loans for the students. No. Ranil was a mercy less Hitler and Joker to violate the Court decisions with Desha Bandu and former Defence Secretary. Dis-regarded court decisions, the Human rights along with the Rajapaksha regime.
Please congratulate the current President of Sri Lanka. 😂
6 times prime minister, I heard 😏
Please mr Hassan  come to sriracha  interview all these cheater (you are great journalist)
Head to Head debates are always entertaining and hilarious man😂
In Sri Lanka, there are some journalists with similar styles, one of whom is Chamuditha. They often interrupt interviewees before they can complete their answers. Many events, human right violations, have occurred worldwide, including in wealthy nations like the US, UK, and various Middle Eastern countries. However, Hasan's approach to questioning the leaders from those countries is different. I do not support Wickremesinghe, nor do I agree with the way Hasan questioned him. What is wrong with attending a birthday party or going to the funerals of friends? Why does Hasan cut off interviewee when they start to give answers he doesn't want to hear? Is this considered good or fair journalism?
Al Jazeera protecting Brutal LTTE who killed even infants 🤮🤮🤮
Mr.Ranil Wickramasinha😄😄😉
Funded by the Tamil LTTE supporters who seek asylum in Europe, Uk & Canada 😂. Thanks to your interview wise SriLankans now know the current JVP (JJB) government is funded by INTERNATIONAL LTTE SUPPORTERS who are trying to divide this country. Thanks for revealing current Traitorous SL Government Agenda 🙏
"noo noooo dhub what you do no nonoo" arghhhhhh fulfilling 😭
Just fake news propaganda machine. Only idiots would watch aljazeera and believe everything they say and promote
Ladies & Gentlemen welcome to the monologue of Mehdi…too bad all the shouting & maneuvering didn’t serve his agenda.   Jaya Sri
Shame on you Aljazera  better beg coins sitting on the road than providing your family with terrorists money. Sri Lanka is an independent country, you live on terrorists money have no rights to interfere with internal matters. Your channel is famous for false and fabricated news.All Tamil, Sinhalese and Muslim people live in peace in Sri Lanka you don't have to bother about them.
I proved about Ranil Wickramasinghe........ 😍
Politicians Like this (Ranil), are the main reason why the Country is in Ruins. This is the Reason why People didn't vote for him. 😏😏🤨🤨😖😖
Mehdi hassan... Hats off to you my brother. Greatly done..... Couldn't done it any better.
Ranil knows all crimes From Rajapakae family
As the gent on the panel said, they are interviewing the wrong guy.
Shameless Mehi Hassan ! Having supporters of a terror organization banned in USA/UK/EU & many others places. Shame on you any Sri Lankans cheering this nonsense where the host did not allow RW to respond to most of the questions - he was defending the country not UNP or any other party. Mehdi should leave journalism & start an NGO supporting terrorist groups as LTTE is not the only group he is supporting.
Why does Mehdi Hasan's face look like "always constipated"?
I’m not a supporter of any politician,  but the truth is that in 2009, Mahinda Rajapaksa provided the leadership for the Sri Lankan Army to defeat the LTTE, bringing an end to decades of civil war.  However, even today, there are people who criticize that event, as if they never wanted Sri Lanka to be a free and peaceful country.  While different perspectives exist, the reality is that the country was liberated from terrorism, allowing Sri Lankans to move forward.
AG is appointed by the president
I'm sure that Al Jazeera has no spine to question presidents of power full countries😅😅😅
👍✅👍👍👍
Hats off al jazzera and mehdi hassan
Protesters didnt kill anyone. What he says is not correct. Anyway u cant trust him

Worse person in Srilanka
Next time Anura kumara Please
Dont you see whose behind this discussion? Its clearly the Tamil diaspora. Everything here is scripted as to the way they wanted it.
We got ranil getting cooked before gta 6
Mehdi Hasan can score big by inviting politicians from 3rd world countries like Sri Lanka into being 'interviewed' by him. But what did the US vice president reply when Mehdi invited him to an interview?  Its very sad to see that many who call themselves Sri Lankans are so ungrateful to their mother country. All they are good for is muddying the waters after drinking from them.
Can you do like interviews with Taliban territories
බටලන්ද මිනීමරුවා, මහබැන්කු හොරා
We are so proud you Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe. We know what tamil tigers need. Mr. Ranil you defended our Army and county from rubbish, NGO's . because of you our mother land not end with a anothet Libia.  This audience i feeled you fight with tigers like a Lion. Other f... Countries no need to put their nose to our country.  Hats off, our Lion Ranil Wickramasinghe. You make us more pround.  Prabhakaran sinhala Jene still working. Tigers wake up. you're dreams will never come true.
ගොන් රනිල්
We dont like  to  Ranil rajapaksha.
the journalist is well conducted the program
Why didn’t Ranil ask help from MANAWAMMA
Can you talk like this US president or Israel president
Bududhama ඉස්සරහට දාගෙන easter attact eka wahaganna හදන seeya
💥👏
For sure Ranil should be go to jail for what he did.. but they were trying their very best to label our war heroes and our victory against ltte as war crimes...  no one talked about how ltte humiliate our heroes and civil people.. anyway ranil is no saint and i hope you could get one of rajapakses and interview.. I'm no ranil fan but at lest let him finish and enjoy his lies.. 😁
How many millions of dollars did you take to set up Ranil?
Look at all these LTTE buggers in the audience fighting again after loosing the war. That LTTE women at the panel doesn't even have a modicum of knowledge about war crimes
used people' money and talking bullshit
The Tamil and Christian communities deserve closure either in Justice or Fair compensation. Otherwise the hate will linger on and in time create a new beast.
Bond thief. Savior of the corrupt . Corrupt politicians have bankrupted sri lanka. Ranil is a cunning man .
I hate this man ranil
First of all, I should say I don't support Mahinda or Ranil.  But Ms. Madura Rasaratnam, at 32:18, you are wrong. You can't compare the situation in Gaza to the war we had with the terrorist group called LTTE. Our army saved Tamil people when the LTTE took them as hostages.
Mehdi continues to deliver 😊, after he made Kenyan government puppet almost cry on stage 😂😂. Big up
Please invite Namal Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa... congratulations journalist we respect you sir..
The interviewer is so disrespectful and needs training on how to conduct a proper interview. He asks questions and doesn’t allow responses, and put words into the interviewees mouth. Al Jazeera this is not good journalism. Yes, it might get the ‘hits’ and makes fantastic sensationalist content but there’s no integrity in this.
How are they still alive?
Next should be sajith premadasa
Hats off for the journalist
For the first time , ranil met a real journalist 😂
I think IMF broke Sri Lanka, without knowing much detail. Where the IMF is, debt traps follow
What an uncouth journalist...
මොලේ අමතක වෙලා ගිහින් ද කොහෙද මොළකාරයට   😂
As usual blabbering useless stuff, whats the point of that Buddhist story ????
Why don't you interview rajapakse
Near India Giant ....is Continue  Sun's Eclipse
As a Srilankan ! I feel ashamed.
Seeya left😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hats  off Al Jazeera. 👏
May be the journalist is well-paid for jabbering 😂😂😂😂  Better it was well behaved Mr.Ranil from Sri Lanka. Otherwise, he would have gone home without a tooth.😂😂😂😂😂
Sri lanka is Buddhist country 🤘
Victoria Dam for Electricity  añd agricultural  help to sri Lanka  by Queen.  Elction  cost bud visiting  cost 0,005%  know?
Ranil RAJAPAKSA is a very cunning / murderer and a rouge politician...
For the first time , I saw a journalist who speaks more than the main speaker. I'm being really fair. A true  journalist or an interviewer should listen well and then counterattack. It is no quality of a true interviewer to interrupt when the main speaker speaks or to ask a new question halfway. I do not see this as a good interview honestly.
Trending Now srilanka this
As Sri Lankans, we gotta share this far and wide. Finally some accountability in sight (but not really, they will keep on denying everything as always). But it's SO good to see politicians being pressed for real answers. Kudos to Al Jazeerah!
Just let Mr Wickramasinghe to talk…
Mr. Ranil you came all this way because unfortunately our country didn't have those kind of amazing journalists. Looks like this is the first time you met one. Thank you for doing this Aljazeera! You reap what you sow grandpa.
This is so disrespectful  for a country’s ex president . Interviewer should allow Mr. Ranil to answer for his questions. This is more like an interrogation than an interview.
ranil wickramasinghe❤❤
Mehdi should give his guest a window to answer the questions. His interruptions are infuriating. Is this interview just to air Mehdi’s opinion?
Batalanda psycho Killer...
Well done Al-Jazeera.... Thank you for exposing the joker.. wish one of the Sri Lankan journalists had half the backbone as he does.
Real Face of Ranil. This is why srilankans did not Vote him. He lost 90% of his elections.
Corruption is chocking the people of Sri Lanka. Laugfs gas was purchasing 50:50 lpg when bottles were exploding they all lied to the people….i had the evidence and documents to prove no media would talk to me ..I still have the evidence. Anusha Palpita. Also was working for Laugfs gas during this period and while on bail for corruption.
Bravo to the journalist ❤
Mr.Hassen .Well done!! Please continue to bring all the others..
Can you interview anura kumara ..?
I don't know why people can't see how the whole line of questions sided with a terrorist group that attacked against civil people lived in a democratic country. This doesn't seems like conering a single politician. It's a part of whole saga, where a state army who defended their country against terrorists, will be branded as war criminals.  This is a clever way of using Sri Lankan people's anger against a corrupted politician to aid and shape other narratives.

❤❤Mr .president ranil wickramasinghe double salute ❤❤
Thank yo very much real journalist
Ranil is brutal man... His action not sweet..
Kudos to the journalist grilled the main culprit of My country by every sense of the word 👌👍
Very childish behavior... Irresponsible... Leader
😂😂
Mehdi loses his composure and fires useless questions on Ranil on birthday parties etc.. This is a low grade of media handling. and by doing this Mehdi loses his reputation.. Ranil is an experienced campaigner who has faced many of such mud slinging on his image down in his country.. at the end Ranil made Mehdi very small in front of the audience and appeared a laughing stock.
Thanks a lot ❤❤
Ranil 🤮  He is a despicable, callous, murderous politician who has plundered the wealth of the working class.
83 Ethnic riots did on purpose by J R jayawardena to wipe out tamil ....every one knows about it ....
Mr. Been 😂
Even in mid seventies Ranil is far ahead of that journalist. After asking several questions by few well prepared people Ranil was given only few seconds to answer. Suddenly jump to another question without letting him to answer. If someone praise their journalism that's clearly because of personal reasons.
Ranil got naild 😄😄😄😄
Ranil purposely destroyed the country economic, Health, education infrastructure, and people facilities, behind that purpose bring the people to slave and ranil wanted to the king
Well done, Al jazeera. You gave him tight!
Great job done by Mr. Wickramasinghe. Well done 👍
Yes yes it is exactly world dangerous killer since Batalanda till now
Propaganda chanal
I think the interviewer was more like an attack dog.
Born	Niranjan Joseph De Silva Deva Aditya 11 May 1948 (age 76) Colombo, Dominion of Ceylon
Batalande prison was a fertilizer company Ranil weckramasinghe sold that company under his uncle government yes that is true Ranil killed lot's of young people and famous journalist
Batalanda I still remember 89-90-what you done?ranil
Ranil very bad man killed many peoples
The true face of the scoundrel, who had maintained a false identity for a long time, was revealed to the world. It is a curse to destroy our beautiful country with thieves and murderers.
45:58  healed at this point 🔥🔥
please ask mahinda to come next
next go interview donald trump if ya got balls
Omg Ranil is too old for this. Please leave him alone Mehdi 😂😂
Mr Hassan Thank you so much for asking such questions from him, he was a murder who had big intelligence. Glad u asked about batalanda.He was the worst out of all.Thank you very much for asking these questions. Please bring Namal Rajapaksa, we would love to see it too
Respect to Mr.Ranil Wickramasinghe. He stood by his country and the SL army. Every person sitting there and asked questions were supporters of LTTE. How come these people who have commented cannot see this? They probably cannot understand what really happened. No knowledge of the English Language.
6:38 ha ha 😂
Mehdi hassan might be the GOAT journalist
Next interview with Anura kumara
To say this was horribly slanted interview is an understanding. It was an ambush. Mehdi Hassan is an extraordinarily thin skinned, faux intellectual who arrogantly makes assumptions over and over again with little to no nuance or context. You (Mehdi) were a condescending, pedantic, aggressive (in the worst way) interviewer who literally put "slanted" words of your interviewee...routinely.    Mehdi arrogantly digs in on his fragile logic and simply does not listen. It is also boorish illogically how he continually cites third party reports and political reports with little to no context yet providing them with abject certainty.  He really needs to be off television...also pick a fair fight Mehdi...the former President's command of English is not as good as you.   You are a horribly insecure individual after getting fired from MSNBC and the failure of your "media" network. You never go against American or British leaders with the same zealous aggression. That would actually take courage, which you do not have.
He is a lier and a murderer
Ideas which expressed regarding the last stages of war in Srilanka was false .. just look at the online videos. But ending war had ended the cause of killing.
Well done aljazira.. ranil gone out 😅
Meri Hassan👎👎👎👎👎
well done  ranil ❤️ respect to you❤️❤️❤️
Ranil he’s slave of Rajapaksha Family!
What an ugly, detestable attitude by this president. Shame on you Sri Lanka for keeping/ giving this man power and opportunity to preside/ govern.
@ HASSAN Thanks for calling sir Lankan precedent @ Al Jazeera English channel..   YOU’RE JUST A KID FRONT OF RANIL WIKRAMASINGHE.....  When you interview a person who makes the country back or when we are down you never visit sir Lankan??  You think you are a TUFF guy.. Pls go and do a HEAT-HEAD talk with Mr. TRUPM, Mr PUTIN, Or talk with Mr. MODI INDIA the same way you speak to sir Lankan former president without giving time to Reply and You run the show..  You Cannot??  Can you able to ask these questions in front of any MIDDLE EAST LEADERS?   You Cannot??  @ Mr Hassan be a professional Journalist and if you invite anyone again future…   Let them talk you don’t talk..   THAT’S WHAT RANIL ASKED GIVE ME 10 MINUTES YOU TAKE 10 MINUTES…  AL JAZEERA Had Many Good reporters and they made this channel worldwide as we still watching…    YOU DON’T PUT IT DOWN ?
His  past is not good   SRILANKANS   NOT  INTEREST OF HIM  BECAUSE OF HORRIBLE   BAD  CARD  BEEN WITH  FORMER  PRASIDANT  R. PREMADASA   DURING   INSERGENCY   THAY  KILLED THOUSANDS  AND  RANIL WICKRAMASINGHA  WAS  CHARGE FOR  BATALANDA     RANIL WICKRAMASINGHA FAMOUS  TO  SRILANKA  HE IS  A GOOD MARCHANDIS   PEOPLE CALL HIM  AS RANIL RAJAPAKSHA   HE IS A  STINKING  MAN
I am so entertained by the foolish head shaking, crowd in the audience..as vindictive…but nowhere near…😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a wasted opportunity 🙄. Ranil's arrogance and oafish behaviour displayed his callous disregard for ALL Sri Lankans. But, Mehdi's arrogant questioning without letting the interviewee answer gave Ranil some Oxygen. I doubt Ranil will ever agree to further independent investigative journalism. 😔
නාකි පොන්නයා ගූ වෙනෝ යසයි තොට ඔහොම වෙලා මදි මු කලිසම ඔලුව්‍ර්න් ගලෝලා එවන්න තිබ්බෙ
Ranil left 😂
The arrogance and narcissism this man posseses from years of being in power is so painfully obvious. Not a cell in his body cares for the people, those living or fallen.
Batalanda report remains suppressed. Chandrika helped  Ranil and thats how Ranil is not behind bars.
The past parliament were full of Rogues protecting each other.  Especially Ranil, Mahinda n etc were the curse for the Island.
Sri Lankan Presidents will never take any accountability. Everyone is good in passing the blam and enjoying good 4 years of the the benefits provided
Apart from protecting the Rajapaksas, Ranil did treat all the communities relatively fairly. Many of the audience's grievances are stemming from the historic injustice done by the far right Sinhalese which is only a fraction of the population.
People are laughing at RW here in Sri Lanka after watching some short clips which were telecasted in Sri Lankan media about Batalanda. But whoever watched this episode must laugh at our selves. This program is totally under tamil diaspora & the people who are asking questions also the same. If they have questions about war crimes & all, first come here & learn what has happened in Mullewaikkal. Then talk again
finally the world gets to know how evil,corrupt the sri lankan government is, they were responsible for the tamil genocode, still waiting for justice for tamil people
I am very happy as a Sri Lankan Ranil answered most of these questions even though reporter has no patience.
I’m always salute my leader Ranil wikramasinga❤
this is propaganda .
❤
Ranil Rajapaksha 😂
I'm not a fan of Ranil and I know about all kind of failures done by the goverment, warcrimes and atrocities thay happend in Sri Lanka the last 50 years but this interview is managed extremely poor and unfair against the former president. My gosh, let him talk and why just ignoring the statements of Nirj Devi. Is that journalism?
Well done Aljazeera❤❤❤
As most of the sri lankans I wanna ask those questions from that corruptted politician. Thank you Al  Jazeera asking all necessary questions onbehalf of me and other sri lankans. ❤
Dear sri lankans why at least a one of you gave this man a vote . He’s out of the context and hes irresponsible.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is one of the most cunning, selfish Pseudo transformational leaders Sri Lanka has ever produced, Bro thought this is a interview by infamous Derana (Dilith Jayaweera's), or Hiru. He tried to give the same scumbagery answers to please the gallery, but got cooked instead.😂 Dear Mr. Ranil Rajapakse, remember the karma is watching🫣💥

45:49 what r u blabbering this guy was also part of the genocide
The old fox Ranil defeated by the dare journalist mehdi Hasan. Congratulations mehdi Hasan..
Ranil Rajapaksha cornered. 😂No answers for that. He is a culprit 😂.
Every Srilankan knows the answers to those questions even though RW didn't answer any 😏
Don't wear sleeveless bros wear pant
A Ferrari-licensed person had an accident.😂😂😂
It's been too long. The world seemed to forget. I'm grateful to Al Jazeera for giving a voice to the victims of the Sri Lankan war. This interview is essential. Finally, after 15 years, the truth is being told. Thank you. This interview is a powerful reminder of the alleged crimes committed. Thank you to everyone involved for bringing this back to the forefront. Especially thank you to Mr. Hassan for the direct and important questions. After 15 years, this interview is a crucial step in acknowledging the suffering of the Tamil people. Thank you for not letting the world forget. Thank you for the freedom of the press that allows these vital stories to be told. The world needs this information. Mr. Hassan's questions were vital. The victims deserve to be heard. Thank you Al Jazeera for bringing this crucial issue back into focus. The world needs to remember.
Here in Sri Lanka  most of the Heads of important institutions were  the PAWNS of the then  ruling party.  Thats how most of the  crimes done by the heirachy were swept under the carpet. " All are friends malli" . You scrath my back and I scrath your. Thats how Sri Lanka fell into the doldrums.
He is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Sri Lankans and a key figure in Sri Lanka’s corrupt politics and economic downfall.
Shameless sinhalese chauvinist....just like israel how he's defending the genocide against tamils.... shame on u
Contrary to most comments here found Hassan’s questioning argumentative and ill informed! Add to that the false news spread about Mr Wickremasinghe exiting the UK in a hurry puts this interview and by extension Aljazeera in the same basket with Fox News! Bunkum!!
Ranil is a murderer 🤬🤬
This was a very biased interview, and all pro LTTE ex support were there...I am not  a fan of Ranil. however, he was interrupted with  so many questions before answering one...
Hats off to Ranil, you did a good job amidst the obstructions 🎉
සීයා නානව නෑමක්
Now world knows what the people of srilanka dealing with in politics
Corrupted politician this world has ever produced
Syrian Moslems massacre thousands of Alawite Moslems...why are you silent? You scream every time a Gazan is killed, but nothing about the Alawites forced to crawl like dogs and then get shot dead??

Respect   MR  Ranil ❤❤❤
ද.... දදදද.. දදදද😂
Al Jazeera thanks 🎉
🇱🇰
But Ranil answered his questions politely
Wish this mehendy guy let ranil speak for once
Please call Gota for an interview and ask how he managed to win the war in 2009 please Mehidi Hassan
Jolly Siya called as the Pin janadipathi Murdered alive by Aljazira 🤣🤣🤣
Why don't you let the interviewee speak? The presenter springs into the middle of the answer many times. That should be avoided next time.
I feel bad for him, considering his age, but he brought this upon himself.
Al jazeera🤢💩
AL Jazeera Journalist missed Very Important Question.  RW contested as PM in 2019 General Elections and his party lost ALL THE SEATS. Understand his personal votes did not count because it was very small.  However the party got a one seat appointed MP.  If I am correct according to the constitution there is a specific time period to nominated the MP.  Long after this time is passed with the blessing of Rajapakses he entered the house from back door. I think this is a violation of the constitution.
I wonder if they would release any bts. *eats popcorn*
Tamil people need in Tamil Eelam country
If you don’t want to answer the real questions? His answer is … no contest.  Is his how he became a PM?
Please interview rajapaksha
😂😂😂😂Only rajapaksha family brought him to the president role. And he protected those criminals
Next namal rajapaksha
As a Sri Lankan living in the Central Province of Sri Lanka, we also struggled with the war for around 30 years. After the end of the war, only now have we just come back to normal life. The international community, why are you all just going to save a terrorist community? You all are speaking about the northern people who died in the war, but lots of Buddhists and Tamil people in the others also died and lost properties in that war, but no one is speaking of those things. Before going for an interview with a former president, you all want to understand that the LTTE is a terrorist gang that murdered millions of lives. And the other thing is Rajapakshe family is the one who done all the damage to the county but you are asking the questions who save the country in a crisis my kind request to bring Rajapakshe family live in your media
Please bring up a nigerian politician, efcc chairman or former senators, the corruption is crazy in nigeria
this are the type of journalists and journalism we want to see, kudos aljazeera, mehdi is a beast
I'm a Sri Lankan.. this is how our politicians respond when a journalist or someone asks a question.. they never answer to the point... we believe the country is in good hands now, and we are waiting until they settle the things.. as it will take some time.. the good part is that they know how to answer the question without being jokers.  So, Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe, the SL people, gave you more than enough time to do your job.. so you failed.. the people have rejected you.. the  majority has rejected you.. so why dont you spend your old age peace fully without being  a joker anymore. The SL people won't ask from you or from Rajapaksa's. What have you done or what will be done.. cause that doesn’t matters any more.. but the sadest part is you guys do not have a shame..  still that thousand talks, but a single word is not to the point. You guys left with us, no choice.. we are not prying for your good health.. We are cursing!  Thank you, Al-Jazeera.
Thank you Al jasira, that's the level of accountability of sriri Lankan politics.both Rajapaksaka and Wickramasinha destroyed the whole nation even today Rajapaksa and his family living in a huge government building that is mainted by locals tax .just Google the name Ranil Wickramasinha,while world can find who is he
These Jokers are running the government syndicates for 100 of years . Nothing would happen to these ghouls they are the system ,process and outcome.
This is Ridiculous. Hon Ranil Wicramasinghe is the only man who developed Sri Lanka.
Ranil, He is not a Sri Lankan Sinha channel journalist
I am not Sirilankan but the former Prisedent  did not want to ansawer some queations.  I ask my self why there is no one person supporting him.   Why all people against his claims and all Sirilankan governments.    I would like to know??
This is so gratifying! Brilliant interview Mehdi Hasan! Wish our journalists had your back bone! I think many Sri Lankans who hate this snake would have felt the same. This man did not pull Sri Lanka out through economic reforms or even by reducing corruption.  He just borrowed more IMF credit increasing our debt burden and taxed the people while appointing 76 "advisors" (friends) for his office alone giving them many luxuries while the average citizen went through so many hardships. He will always be a Ranil Rajapkse! This man who even basically robbed our central bank, deserves to be in prison! Thank you for exposing him for what he is.
I bet this guy will never get the Rajapakshas for a grilling like this, Nomatter how great his argument is, all these guys are under the payroll of Rajapakshas, they just need a scapegoat and now they have Ranil , since Namal is cool enough to work as a politician this is the base setting to get the people to get Mahindas son back in the game, I wish this journalist says why he wont be able to get the Rajapakshas on the stand,  Nevertheless I dont think its fair to grill a person who actually admitted his faults and bowed his head to democracy when Anura Kumara won, Where as the Rajapakshas dragged the winner Sarath fonseka and denied him the win for Presidency, 👍 I guess this comment will be deleted
Seems like still the LTTE terrorist diaspora fundings are going on.. Thanks   former president standing for the intergrity of Sri Lanka
What has happened to Lakshman Kadiragaman, Lalith Athulathmudali our best diplomats. Who murdered them  cold handedly 😢.
Once someone said "brother, they all are friends".SL politicians🤦🏻‍♀️
Mahdhi Hassan ❤️👍🏻
great leader ranil
This is Absolute Darama 😂😂
Six time Prime Minister. One time president. That is part of the problem.
Al Jazeera has cut 2hour video into 1 hour video.   Ranil gave a press conference about this.❤  Still ranil won every argument while not letting him speak, what a shame garbage media. 😊
I DARE Mehdi and Aljazeera to do this to TRUMP and NETANYAHU. THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL TO INVITE A FORMER PRESIDENT AND ATTACK HIM.
10.21 This murderer filed a case so that the Rajapaksa's are freed
doesn't allow ranil to speak. same as talk with chamudita. mehdi hassan = chamuduta samarawikrama
Tamils killed during GENOCIDE 500,000+ THE GENOCIDE THAT HAPPENED Babies, Kids, Woman and Men that were GRAPED during the GENOCIDE
Those werent even hard / unexpected questions, Ranil just got emotional and became a joke
Thank you Mr Hassan even Srilankan journalist couldnt ask these questions from this dictator he is spoiled our future with lot of corruption partnering with Mahinda Rajapaksha The question You Asked from him all are true Im a srilankan So proud of you
Thank you  Mr. Niraj Deva for you clarification.
Please bring Mahinda Rajapaksha, please 🙏🏼🙏🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼
This interview is banned in Sri Lanka
Mr Bean
It was bad Journalism and Impolite of Hassen .
This is a LTTE diaspora  funded  documentry  for  sure. Unortunately   they  couldn't  ask any questions  about  innocent  people  those  who  died  from  LTTE  BUS  BOMBING in all over  the island.
I'm against what RW stands and I am totally against the harm done to civilians during the war in our country. But does anyone notice how all these international platforms fail to recognize the thousands of men women and children killed by the LTTE ?? Aren't those war crimes ?
Hassan is so immature and shame of Jazeera, of having such a journalist, being aggressive  and disruptive way of presenting doesn't make them clever..
It is not professional and respectful not letting to talk and the voice tone attitude towards a president, I'm not here to agree what Ranil did is right but the ethics, you can't do the right thing the wrong way, setting examples of interview is important Hassan.. You are just like the local guy chamudhitha,, there are facts but disgusting way of presenting.

Ranil❤
Mehdi, you absolute fool—what a pathetic excuse for a brain. Some claim the terrorists’ money still prowls and haunts the shadows.
Saw a power hungry egoistic man getting humbled and saw the Sri Lankan community’s incapability in seeing the bigger picture
ரனில் நாட்டுக்காக கிழித்த தாள் எதுவுமில்லை😂 ராஜபக்க்ஷவை காப்பாற்றியது தவிர   Sri lanakan Mr bean on fire 😂
What is the meaning of civil war …every time he asking about civil war
It is because he is an international journalist and it is because of Mehdi Hasan that such grilling of Ranil W had taken place and RW had been cornered well & truly. Mehdi is a well known to be a no nonsense, hardened, eloquent journalist who has rattled many politicians with his probing questions. Ranil didn't know what was coming & was ill prepared & over confident.
Mehdhi Hassan, u r really an intelligent journalist. Its very nice to c this discussion which didnt take place in Sri Lanka. Thanks to AlJazeera
Mr Ranil 👎👎👎😂😂 😂
Talk with Chamuditha English version :(
Wow !! I never listened to this Hippocrate man’s voice  But this interview is very interesting  Thank you real journalist 🎉🎉🎉
very good jounalist 👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍
Thanks❤🙏
It is trending in sri lanka now
As Sri Lankans, we know Ranil Wickremesinghe is not a great politician, but when it comes to the civil war, one thing is clear—he played a key role in exposing the LTTE's true intentions. In that sense, he is a legend because Prabhakaran killed more Sinhala people than even Tamils. The LTTE caused destruction for all communities, and Ranil's approach during that time changed the course of the conflict
Al Jazeera, please teach your labourer, the interviewer to talk to a former president of a country with respect and proper manners. Feel shame about this labourer and his family background.
Ranil's face says everything 😂. He met a real journalist finally.  Thanks for Al Jazeera for this. ❤
Well done Mr.president.i think you are the only politician who can face this type of situation.  If it is AKD  what would be the consequences. We are proud of you.
Vickramashinga is just avoiding accusation on Buddhist people
It would be best if Al Jazeera could add subtitles to this discussion so that most of the people could understand the discussion.
Many terrorists in UK
The real sad part to this is that no one believes that us Sri  Lankan suffered through terrorism caused by the L.T.T.E.   I lived through this war and had many close calls to my own life.. and this was caused by the L.T.T.E.  if it wouldn't have been for the army led by the rajapaksa's, I wouldn't be a live to write this on here..  Aljazeera from day one has known to be fake news..they spread lies and get people hooked.. but we the people of Sri Lanka know what really happened.
Big up aljazeera
Vickramashinga. Is a sleeping Buddhist Extremists
Mehdi retire pls ..you have narcissistic personality disoreder. .what a cheap journalist...No wonder you got kicked out from MSNBC ..The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment and shear hatred on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the preplanned smearing plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...What a waste of money they were surely thinking...hahaha what sore losers😝😝 these tamil rascist terrorist diaspora has become more and more pathetic with their own fantasized theories  even after 15 years since defeat at mullivaikal...they will soon rot in their own hate along with that rascist white witch of a journalist 😂😂😂😂what a treat to watch these miserable people rotting in their own rascism and hatred🎉
as a patriotic Sri Lankan citizen I must say that shame on you al Jazeera and to the mr mehedi hasan  for your media platform's  very one sided  biased interview with our country's former president h.e ranil wickramasinghe sir  cos I can give one example  that is after this heated debate with our former president i went through the YouTube channel as well as the other social media platforms and specially the Google search  and I got to know about this  mehedi Hassan fellow s past  interviews with other guests such as Mr Matt Goodwin ( lecturer at the university of Burminghang United kingdom etc) and during that interview  with British  conservative  ideological  intellectual  Mr Hassan  behaved  very calmly and  allowed his guest  to talk freely and gave him an appropriate time to Expressed his personal opinions and views specially about  topics like immigration   as well as various Islamists  threats to the British society etc etc.  though I think that Mr Hassan is  some  what an Islamist  ideological  as well  as pro labour  political ideological  person he gave an enough time to his guest which mostly   expressed  totally opposite  type of views and opinions etc  but unfortunately mr mehedi Hassan  didn't  behaved like that way when he interviewed Sri Lanka's former president h.e mr ranil wickramasinghe sir   and as the host  journalist he behaved very arrogant and biased  person  specially to biased with the banned ltte terrorist organization and its ideology  etc so for me this journalist is definitely a very pro ltte ideological minded person  ( along with pro Hamas ideology too ) and  he clearly danced with the ltte terrorist tune  😂😂😂😂 😢😢😢and except from mr niranjan dev  the other two ladies which directly participated  with that conversation  were  totally pro LTTE  Ideological  individuals  and  its clearly visible to every balance minded person that the vast majority of members in that audience were  totally  pro ltte and anti Sri Lankan forces and anti rajapaksha  people 😂😂😂😂so that interview was  not a very balanced and unbiased interview  and every  patriotic and nationalist Sri Lankans must definitely be proud and thankful to our former president hon wickramasinghe for his courageness  and  brave approached and  participation  to that mostly one sided pro ltte ideological and supported interview 😂😂😂and the other important factor is when I searched the Google  i got ti to know that mr Hassan earlier  worked as a journalist in the British channel 4 media platform  but unfortunately this channel 4 made totally fabricated and false pro ltte propaganda and anti Sri Lankan forces   programmes like  the killing fields in Sri Lanka  as well as another  questionable programme  about  the Easter Sunday suicide bombing attacks  etc in   both programmes British channel 4 tried to tranish the image of Sri Lankan military forces and former Sri Lankan presidents  such as his excellency hon mahinda rajapaksha sir and his excellency hon Gotabaya rajapaksha sir  and  still trying to  spread false and fake news about our security forces and against these national leaders etc  so mr mehedi  was a  former  journalist belongs to that  media platform  and  this will further reflects about the total anti Sri Lankan forces and  anti rajapaksha stance and views of people like Mr mehedi Hassan and other NGO backed  anti Sri Lankan forces  people
Vikramashinga is still pretentious about all the crime done
Thank you Hasan .. ❤
How much paid by the  diaspora for this journalist? This conversation not about economic crisis it was about LTTE TERRORIST and their supporters asking questions😂😂😂.they are fired already in srilanka 😂😂
👍🙏🙏🙏
Why do both of them talking at the same time. Its hard to listen
This is the level of journalism that we should have in Sri Lanka .lots of journalists in sri lanka don't have this much of a confidence to deal with these corrupted politicians.Its kinda sad.
Boycotting  every  questions  journalist ask. This kund of leader any country  want?.he dont care about the  country  or people    except our votes.
As a Sri Lankan, it's frustrating to see how leaders continue to evade accountability. While economic recovery is crucial, justice for past crimes and genuine political reform are just as important. The voices of the people who protested for change should not be ignored. This discussion highlights many uncomfortable truths that need to be addressed for Sri Lanka to move forward.
You 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bravo to Aljazeera and Mehdi for roasting RW. This interview  gave me immense satisfaction to prove to a global audience  what a Joker this guy has been. He had the opportunity to answer the questions head on, instead he dodged it and behaved in an amateurish manner which was a disgrace to say the least.
🫡 Mehdihasan
He embarrassed himself
Well said Ranil
Please translat this video into Sinhala and Tamil.
Its very clear what propaganda this is all about.
This is a joke if you interview this person first, thoroughly you have to study the whole story what was happened since 1970s . Those politicians playing a game using innocent citizens. This person is a one of the greatest butcher in srilanka.
45:48 “I saw him singing at his birthday party” was hilariousss😭 Great responses
Medi Hasan , you acts like a fool man, and you failed in this interview,  butI am not a Fan of RW
Amazing interview.  Love it. There are no answers for Runil. Please invite Rajapaksha.
හානව😂
Some of these OG Sri Lankan politicians are more British than the old British colonialists who used to rule that beautiful Island.
He deprived  our higher education  by creating  fear and uncertainty.    during  1988 1989.  We couldn't do A/L because  He is the fabricator of batalanda touching camp. And accountable for all killings , crime against humanity 😢
Sri Lanka had ethnic & political issues since generations. Who to be blamed? This is a sensitive field that politicians, media & international bullies taking advantage of. We are all human beings. People live their lives and sometimes fight for their own well-being. What can you expect when all races fight for their own rights. The philosophy of survival is the existence by controlling the less able. The ultimate result is victory for one side and defeat for the other. Everyone has their own excuse for taking negative actions. The final result can never be positive. It is accepted that killing is not the solution in advance society. But so called advance societies are killing in massive scales. Nobody say no to war in the international economy. They like war to do business. Mass production of weapons are good business for international perpetrators. Why don't you raise your voice against this. No weapons mean no mass killing. Who produce weapons for mass killings? Who make the monies by selling weapons to the vulnerables. Why not stop from there? This is all bullschit! You all don't exist if there is no war! KARMA!!!
ANOTHER BULLSHIT OF MEHDI
This is truly disturbing to watch. I’ve never seen such an unprofessional and blatantly biased journalist. Al Jazeera has always stood against Sri Lanka, and this interview is just another example of their agenda. However, Ranil Wickremesinghe did a great job and stood firm for the country. The biggest joke is the Sri Lankans here, thanks to Al Jazeera. What a disgrace!
This is very painful to watch ….
Ranil is spy in british  and america  he is srilanken trator his forefather was a spy in british  era betery srilanken force in1800 era
We need more journalists like him. Within a few minutes, the entire drama of Sri Lankan politics was brought to light.🎉
John 14:16-20 kjv  16 And I will pray the FATHER  , and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  17 Even the SPIRIT of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth HIM not, neither knoweth HIM: but ye know HIM; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.  18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.  19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.  20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my FATHER, and ye in me, and I in you.  Ame   Repent guys   Ephesians 2:8-9 kjv  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of GOD:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  10 For we are HIS workmanship, created in CHRIST JESUS unto good works, which GOD hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  Amen  but faith without works is dead tok just as bosy without SPIRIT is dead ,   read james 2 pls  Holy BIBLE
*JESUS* is coming soon and He will judge the world , both living and the dead 2 Corinthians 5:10-21 kjv   10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.  11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.  12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.  13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to GOD: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.  14 For the love of CHRIST constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:  15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.  16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.  17 Therefore if any man be in CHRIST, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.  18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by JESUS CHRIST, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;  19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.  20 Now then we are ambassadors for CHRIST, as though GOD did beseech you by us: we pray you in CHRIST's stead, be ye reconciled to GOD.  21 For HE hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of GOD in HIM.  Amen   For our Most High Almighty Father had made Him , our Christ who knew no sin to be sin for us , to die on the cross for our sins and Ressurect, that we might be made the Righteousness of the Almighty in Him  Romans 3:23 kjv  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of GOD;  Amen   we have all sinned and come short of Him , and then   Romans 6:23 kjv  23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of GOD is eternal life through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.  Amen   That's why we need a Saviour to save us from our sins , since all sinned , and we are all ( even Prophets ) are imperfect , who can be our Saviour? Saviour has to be sinless...  that's why the Most high almighty sent His only Begotten Holiest Son to die for our sins and Resurrect, because He alone was sinless , and never did any sin  There's only one true Almighty and three Holiest Divine persons ,   The *FATHER* is Almighty , the *SON* is Almighty and the *HOLY SPIRIT* is Almighty   and there's only one Almighty Holiest  *G-D*  1 Peter 1:2 kjv  1 Peter, an apostle of JESUS CHRIST, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,  2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of GOD the FATHER, through sanctification of the SPIRIT, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of JESUS CHRIST: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.  Amen  Romans 1:7 kjv  7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of GOD, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from GOD our FATHER, and the LORD JESUS CHRIST.  Amen   Hebrews 1:1-14 kjv  1 GOD, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,  2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by HIS SON, whom HE hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also HE made the worlds;  3 Who being the brightness of HIS glory, and the express image of HIS person, and upholding all things by the word of HIS power, when HE had by HIMself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:  4 Being made so much better than the angels, as HE hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.  5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my SON, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a FATHER, and he shall be to ME a Son?  6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of GOD worship HIM.  7 And of the angels HE saith, Who maketh HIS angels spirits, and HIS ministers a flame of fire.  8 But unto the SON HE saith, They throne, O GOD, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of THY kingdom.  9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore GOD, even thy GOD, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  10 And, THOU, LORD, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:  11 They shall perish; but THOU remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;  12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.  13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on MY right hand, until I make THINE enemies they footstool?  14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?  Amen    John 3:10-22 kjv  10 JESUS answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the SON of man which is in heaven.  14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the SON of man be lifted up:  15 That whosoever believeth in HIM should not perish, but have eternal life.  16 For GOD so loved the world, that HE gave HIS only begotten SON, that whosoever believeth in HIM should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For GOD sent not HIS SON into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through HIM might be saved.  18 He that believeth on HIM is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the NAME of the ONLY begotten SON of GOD.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in GOD.  22 After these things came JESUS and HIS disciples into the land of Judaea; and there HE tarried with them, and baptized.  Amen   Acts 4:8-12 kjv  8 Then Peter, filled with the HOLY GHOST, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,  9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of *JESUS CHRIST* of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom *GOD* raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  Amen   Romans 10:9-10 kjv  Romans 10:9 King James Version 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Revelation 21:1-8 kjv  21 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.  2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from GOD out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of GOD is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be HIS people, and GOD himself shall be with them, and be their GOD.  4 And GOD shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.  5 And HE that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.  6 And HE said unto me, It is done. I AM Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.  7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his GOD, and he shall be MY son.  8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Amen   Repent guys    1 John 5:7-8 kjv  7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the FATHER, the WORD, and the HOLY GHOST: and these three are one.  8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the SPIRIT, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.   Amen     The *_Holy BIBLE_* is the true Holiest WORD because  2 Peter 2:21 kjv  21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of GOD spake as they were moved by the HOLY GHOST.  Amen  Repent guys no one can save us Except   Almighty holiest CHRIST  Ephesians 2:8-9 kjv  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of GOD:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  10 For we are HIS workmanship, created in CHRIST JESUS unto good works, which GOD hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  Amen
Romans 5:8 kjv  8 But GOD commendeth HIS love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, CHRIST died for us.  Amen  Phillipians 2:5-11 kjv  5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in CHRIST JESUS:  6 Who, being in the form of GOD, thought it not robbery to be equal with GOD:  7 But made HIMself of no reputation, and took upon HIM the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:  8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.  9 Wherefore GOD also hath highly exalted HIM, and given HIM a NAME which is above every NAME:  10 That at the NAME of JESUS every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;  11 And that every tongue should confess that JESUS CHRIST is LORD, to the glory of GOD the FATHER.  Amen   Romans 8:1-2 kjv  8 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in CHRIST JESUS, who walk not after the flesh, but after the SPIRIT.  2 For the law of the SPIRIT of life in CHRIST JESUS hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

Amen  Acts 4:8-12 kjv   8 Then Peter, filled with the HOLY GHOST, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,  9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of *JESUS CHRIST* of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom *GOD* raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  Amen  1 Corinthians 15:1-11 (kjv)  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that CHRIST died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that HE was buried, and that HE rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  5 And that HE was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:  6 After that, HE was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.  7 After that, HE was seen of James; then of all the apostles.  8 And last of all HE was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.  9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of GOD.  10 But by the grace of GOD I am what I am: and HIS grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of GOD which was with me.  11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.  Amen  Repent guys this only truth amen ❤  Amen  Ephesians 2:8-10 kjv  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of GOD:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  10 For we are HIS workmanship, created in CHRIST JESUS unto good works, which Gods hath before ordained that we should walk in them.  Amen

Please interview the KAPUTA!!
@20.24 when the interviewer was asking about the easter attack question Ranil was smirking and then suddenly realized he’s on a stage and getting broadcasted.  Also Ranil is a Catholic by birth, he became a Buddhist just to get in to politics 😒
Very unprofessional and childish to turn the body posture away from the interviewer...... disgusting Ranil
Good reporting channel. This ranil is failed politician by people's voting power. if its in  Europe civilised politicians will take responsive  & will resign..but in srilanka......
THE  "ROBBERY  AND   THIEF"   President   in  the  History   of  Sri Lanka   is  "Maina" (mahinda)  PEOPLE  REALLY  HATE   HIM !!
Can you invite Namal Rajapaksa next time.he is Ranil rajapksha sons (not real)
Another question: How many lies you said to the people to come to power during your over 40 yrs of so-called political career. Liars are always get stuck when they face the truth
Medhi should mind his place though, after all he is just a news reader, the other man was a leader of a country - many levels apart in the heirachy... Show some respect, Medhi behaved like poor man's Piers Morgan, kept interrupting answers - muppet 😅
Please invite Mahinda Rajapakshe's sons 🙏
අනුරට මෙවා බෑ.
1983 riots created by Ranil's uncle J. R. Jayawardhana - President.
I respect the journalist first, also next time interview ex president of all in Sri Lanka , also batalanda is one of the massive young people died  Salute for your 👍
Mehdi retire pls ..you have narcissistic personality disoreder. .what a cheap journalist...No wonder you got kicked out from MSNBC ..The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment and shear hatred on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the preplanned smearing plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...What a waste of money they were surely thinking...hahaha what sore losers😝😝 these tamil rascist terrorist diaspora has become more and more pathetic with their own fantasized theories  even after 15 years since defeat at mullivaikal...they will soon rot in their own hate along with that rascist white witch of a journalist 😂😂😂😂what a treat to watch these miserable people rotting in their own rascism and hatred🎉
Who will come to get interviewed by this mad man who doesnt allow the guest to talk..he can question and answer himself..no wonder this poor journalist got fired from msnbc😂😂😂
Still some idiots in the forum supporting him 😢
RW bluffed average journalists all these years but had to face a exceptional personality. Well done.
Im not a RW fan, but why are Mehdi et all bombarding  just this person with all these questions?
Mister Been 😂😂😂
Good Job, Mehdi!
Now, if Al Jazeera World gives an announcement for an interview with politicians in Sri Lanka, it will be difficult for them to come. Not for all   Thanks Al Jezeera
Tamils right to self determination to be fulfilled.
Meihdi is not listening to  explanations that points to alternate expkanations other than criticism
Mr. Hassan. Hats off 🫡🫡
I cant believe that RW went fir this alibe. Dud he not have a pre- run of the potentisl questions?
රනී.....ල් ❤ කොහොමද කඩ්ඩ කොල්ලගෙ
Whatever Mr.Ranil is saying is a lie 🫠
How come the ex- President faced 4 people who opposed him? It is a bit one sided isn't it,?  It is good to hear answers from the horse's mouth but this did become a shouting match , which R W is well known for. Hope RW gets off his high horse and keeps out of politics. No time for further trashing the country by aiding and abetting
THANKS AL JAZEERA FOR EXPOSING THE PONNAYA! HIGHLY INCAPABLE MAN, CAN'T EVEN ANSWER A QUESTION PROPERLY! .. PATTA MINI MARUWA.. BATALANDA KILLER!  HE WAS NEVER A PRESIDENT BY PEOPLE'S VOTE!
Fellow Sri Lankan  See how organized are these politicians ruined our lives amd nation  Be strong be unite as a nation
Back then, journalists were killed for calling out corruption from the hands of these villains, which is why majority were scared to raise their concerns and voices. But hats off to Mehdi and Aljazeera! The truth is always bitter and so is karma!
While I disagree with many of Ranil's views, he is correct in one thing that Palestine is internationally recognized as a state, whereas there is no such recognition for a Tamil state in Sri Lanka.  So who created the war and once terrorism got defeated crying to the international Praba babies 👶🏼
The whole Rajapakshe  family from  Mahindas first tenure started the rot This crisis cannot be solved by any economic reforms by IMF or austerity measures The only way out is bringing the corrupts to books and recovering the looted wealth
My humble request. Can jazeera interview former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?  It's really fantastic debate. Congrats Mr Mahdhi
Thank you Al-Jazeera
This all members are LTTE supporters without ranil wikramasinghe.
Excellent.  Well Tabled by RW👍❤
Can write a family history and all the things we talked Thamil tigers my mother elder brother (Rangebandara) kidnapped at Thoppigala erea in Sri Lanka  he was forest officer at that moment Mu Arukgoda as a director in the Sri Lankan film industry all so kidnapped with him.We didnt get any Justice from thamil Pepole.Were I mean We didnt find in any bones any clue to find him barred place Pray for rest in peace. We ask them we're is my Uncle?  Here are a few ways that you can be respectful to my family heritage but still seek justice ? We are flabbergasted and Suffering decades as a families .
The title is , “Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crisis”, but just 1% of the interview is focused on that, then they discuss about Easter attacks and, the rest of the 90% is about a different propaganda, and we know who is behind that. The journalist is just pleasing the crowd😅.  Btw I am not a supporter of Ranil nor Mahinda, but I am a supporter of my country, yes we made mistakes in 1983, which the state was ineffective in managing, but we Sri Lankans paid for it from the lives of both sides. After multiple failed discussions with the terror group, clearing them out using the military was the only option.  Now it is time to forget the past and build the North and Eastern provinces, provide those children with the best education and healthcare possible, built new cities and other infrastructure, make them wealthy , because after all elimination of poverty will eliminate most of the social problems.  One nation and one Sri Lanka ❤
This is on the next level
Thank you Mr. Hassan🙏🙏🙏
"I was a subject of her majesty"  why do Sri Lankans still have a colonized inferiority complex. Can they not see that colonialism is the very reason our country is where it is today. If anyone tries to say that conditions were better under the British, they need to learn history.
He's very very  crafty man in srilanka .
Mahinda rajapakshata.. gottaby rajapaksha  And he's party  Uneducated minister's  Robers
Ranil rajapaksha 😂😂. Thank you aljazeera❤❤
Im in no way a fan of Mr. Ranil, but this interview is a hit peice carefully woven to attck the past incidents of the Srilankan history to look like Srilanka the bad guys. And they used Ranil to do it. If you want answers ask the question and let the man speak, by continuous attacks on the speaker not letting the answers to be given is a massive RED flag for me. I put this interview under PROPERGANDA hit peice.
Mr ranil got out from sl . U r lying so much .. u griled . Thank u mehdi as a srilankan u have asked many questions regarding srilankan
Ranil shaking him self
Shame on Al jazz to employ such a mentally deranged person to interview a president who turned around a bankrupt country in such a short period of time !  Ranil is greater than even Trump !
This is the kind of international recognision he has😂 .. roasted
Mr ranil got out from sl . U r lying so much .. u griled . Thank u mehdi as a srilankan u have asked many questions regarding srilankan
Very nice from Canada 🇨🇦
Ranil, remember this: justice delayed is justice denied. Any country or nation cannot execute 'genocide' their way to liberation. This is true from the Palestine to Sri Lanka or anywhere else.  With a very heavy heart I bear the extreme pain and intergenerational trauma of the Tamil nation as I am listening to this drama.
Please telecast the full interview to be fair to all. The full interview is around 2 hours, you have edited this to suit a narrative that puts Mr. Wickramasinghe in a negative light as well as Sri Lanka.
I like this interview I love it Mr Hasan I like it this journalist
Respect to journalists ❤❤❤
Thank you🙏
To the tamil diaspora - Sri lanka is a mutli cultural hub with a rich heritage and history. The sinhalese are the majority and that's a fact. Our generation in no way agree on the injustices done by a few within the Sinhalese majority to our Tamil brothers and sister back then. This was indeed a war crime and most of the culprit (J.R etc) are dead and forgotten now. It was never right and it will never be.  However, there is no chance whatsoever that a separate Tamil state be established in Sri Lanka (an island). If the pro eelam guys are so keen, why don't you go to Tamil nadu where there is an already established Tamil state? If you don't have racism in your hearts then sri lanka welcomes all. We just gotta live in peace and harmony together as Sri Lankans.
Ranil while claiming that Sri Lanka had no money for elections he appointed 39 of his very corrupt close friends as his advisors. They were given luxury vehicles, salaries and all the possible benefits. This was a blatant act of corruption while millions of people were starving.
Thanks Al Jazeera
Pro terror TV channel Al Jazeera's mouthpiece Hamas terrorist sympathiser interviewer can not help supporting terrorists in Gaza and take a swipe at Israel. We live in a world where terrorists are seen as equal to be treated and cared for, for killing innocent civilians indiscriminately for their blood thirsty spirit of Dagon. When Hamas terrorists are operating from within the Gaza hospitals, Israel has to keep quiet and let Her children die? What nonsense is this?  Sri Lankan politicians can not look after and give justice to the majority. How can they do so for the minorities?
A foreigner who tries to show that he knows more about what happened in Sri Lanka than a Sri Lankan. I feel like dying laughing. 🤣🤣🤣
Hats off mehadi
,,தமிழ் ஈழம்😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤pls
Mental disorder in the highest
Mehdi we proud of you ❤❤❤❤from sri lanka 🇱🇰
Rani Blast ! Thank you Al Jazeera !!! He is a  responsible for collops  the country ., he is kill our young crowd a lot
Next bring Mr Narendra Modi 😂
He was fired from left right and center with all guns blazing 😂😂😂 and finally had no clue and ended up like a Joker
If Palki_Sharma had hosted this program, it would have turned into a completely one-sided discussion favoring Ranil Wickremesinghe. Given her apparent bias towards him, the conversation might have ended up being more of a whitewash, glossing over critical issues instead of holding him accountable.
A professional journalist should be calm and should allow the person to talk and express his views or comment fully . This man wanted to just talk his own stuff only . Doesn’t make any sense of this and stupidest part some are clapping over it 😅
Can you broadcast whole video because he saying you has telecast only one hour we also want to know the thruth
It's quite disappointing to see how Ranil Wickremesinghe avoids giving direct answers to the journalist's questions in this interview. Instead of addressing the issues head-on, he seems to dodge and deflect, sidestepping accountability. As citizens, we expect transparency and honesty from our leaders, especially when addressing critical matters. It’s important for all leaders to engage openly and take responsibility to build trust with the public. Until the day comes when justice is served and wrongdoing is duly punished, we will continue to wait and watch.
I am proud of our former president! Salute to you!
،great interview  Thanks al jazeera and Mr mehdi hasan
Jazeera 👑👑👑thanks for revieling his cunning  face
Vincent Fernando used to be one of Ranil's ex-boyfriends. He witnessed everything happened in Batalanda so he got poisoned by his own wife (Ranil's body guard Sudath Chandrasekara's side chick) prior to the case. Btw Ranil's bodyguard found this "wife" for  Mr. Vincent. Mr. Vincent was just an innocent man who got betrayed by his boyfriend and his wife.
The world is watching
What a horrendous, babbling idiotic monster!
Ranil is neither a successful politician nor a president. However, for those who were asking questions on the lines of thr civil war that lasted 30 years; there were no winners. Both the tamil and thr Sri Lankan people suffered for the sake of poitical and radical ambitions of both the LTTE and the SL government alike. There is a new government in SL now. Thr least corrupt we have had in a while. Let us not kling to the past, learn from it, and move forward.
While appreciate for the guts that journalist got it feels like one sided sometimes as he always target Ranil and push to get what he expected for the answer.   Also it is sad to note that world think that Sinhalese people are the only race who committed crimes… it’s like two sides of the coin.   Entire war is based on power hunger…. Inna way Ranil tried to establish peace…. But again that doesn’t mean he is innocent…..   Also notes so many Tamil people left out of the country claiming they were blagarded by the Sinhalese and got the PR….
channel 4 = Al jasiera
He is a shrewd and seasoned fox, adept at slipping away with effortless ease.🤣👌
He is a shrewd and seasoned fox, adept at slipping away with effortless ease.🤣👌
Terrorist's money at work. Everyone knows the truth. This rubbish is banned in many countries for a reason.
Ranil like a small child behaving. Thank you mr Hassan ALJAZEERA
Parangi jana kalawam sinhalayo innawa lankawe..un demalunta wada maubimata waira karanawa...
Ltte and jvp distroy our country...
It’s simply so sad and shameful to see one of our well read ministers stutter and being so undiplomatic in such a place.   How can a person in power who could enjoy all the benefits of his position have no answers to the simple yet so powerful questions asked 😢  Being a Muslim lankan, I feel so ashamed for being so ignorant of the intensity of the LTTE war crimes and the rest which followed…. We were so fooled ☹️
This clown is not fit to be a president, he should join the circus
Totally wrong and misleading...about  facts former presidents..including Mahinda Rajapaksha & Gotabaya Rajapaksha most of the allegations are fakes...and gossips build on gobels  theory to distracted public to avoid the country real national leaders and dishonest on them..USAID and EU NGO funding done that conspiracy very well...but they couldn't able to achieve their goal our leaders give a messive blow that they unexpected  ...as a responsible media channel dont spread lie...and dont compared with palstine..it is two different senarios...☝
EXCUSES, EXCUSES AND YET MORE EXCUSES. NO OWNERSHIP OF ACCOUNTABILITY.
Mr Fox . ❤
Proud of Mr Ranil for the way he handled a novice. Remember this is President Trump's world for the next four years.
Who are you trying to fool Ranil? Nobody buys your BS anymore
Fake news  journalist running propaganda
Please invite Basil Rajapaksha for a head to head conversation in ENGLISH
Thank you, our former President, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, for defending our nation against international terrorist groups.   You speak on behalf of all Sri Lankans living around the world. This interview shows the international pressure on the war in the past and how bravely former President Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa handled the situation. You are like a lion fighting against tigers in the middle of the tigers’ camp alone.  Al Jazeera always represents terrorism, and they promote terrorism. This is the number one international terrorist media in the world. Al Jazeera is another Channel 4 that spreads false news to the world.  Those who judge the war depend on the few pieces of evidence exposed to the international community by the Tamil Tigers. They don’t know the real situation in the battlefield and the country. The Tigers killed our innocent people. They committed genocide in the North and East. They killed thousands of Sinhalese. Where were you at the time? Did anyone talk about human rights? Did anyone support our army in stopping terrorism? Why is everyone talking right now?  Remember, we are Sri Lankans. No one can ever defeat our army in the past, present, or future. Sri Lanka is a peaceful country where anyone can live freely under one flag. If anyone is trying to divide our country, then they deserve to leave the country or face the consequences.   We are the people in the past who fought with swords against guns until victory. As a nation, we will never be defeated.  Thank you again, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. After all, you stand on the side of our motherland.  No Eelam in Sri Lanka. The Tigers were defeated many years ago by proud Lions.  🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
No matter which Sinhala leader comes to power (including the current NPP), they all are genocide supporters
Very much disappointed to see some many Sri Lanka's, in the comment section,  upholding the lights of Western Hypocritical Influence alleging WAR CRIMES against our own underlying the catastrophic Disaster Sri Lanka would have faced which would be much further than the recent economic collapse. Truely, this shows why we as a nation failed, Choosing sides an fueding over, according to different agendas of the Western World!
He is a murder
RW, hail your gallantry,singly !
❤
Mr Hassan, you are the best journalist .🎉 Ranil Wikramesingha is the leader of white collar thieves in Srilanka ... The other one is Naki Maina....

imagine ranil when he is prime
Welldone Ranil , what a childish interviewer.
Finally Justice!
I thought he can speak English at least 😂😂😂 but he cant 😂
These comments are funny…..they used praise rajapakse and this clown now they despise them 😂😂
much needed interview thank you AL Jazeera for exposing these stuff
As Sri lankans, We all know who Ranil and mahinda rajapaksha are, They are very cunning men, they did economic mismanagement, corruption, and widespread suffering for the people of Sri Lanka.
Wow fantastic great justice to all srilankans.....if any leader is straight forward they can easily face any kind of interviews but being one of the culprits and supporting the Criminals, i would say that the former president really asked for trouble 😂😂😂
Terrorist sympathisers, is this an interview or a interrogation. Let the man answer questions
How can this man demolish the dignity of his country like this?
What a corrupt and dishonest former President! Very childish!
Ranil ❤❤❤
When everyone was against him, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe answered everyone’s questions without struggling and handled the situation very well. Hats off to Ranil Wickremesinghe for this.  I would like to request that next time, someone from the Rajapaksa family be brought into this kind of debate.
They know everything about what happened to srilanka than people who are live in srilanka. But still some people take Rajapaksha's and Ranil's side 😢 .ranil was joking while the interviwer asking serious questions. If you can translate this interview  into sinhala and publish on social media will be a great work because most of the srilankan people can't understand the language 😕 (im also not perfect )
This healed me. No journalist in main stream to question like this here in sri lanka. Thank u for revealing truth side of this fu.... thief murderer..
I am thanking al Jazeera regarding this interview, Don't forgot all other international political leaders knows, this what was happening.
Somebody get the singhala subtitles on this video and make it viral. As the majority of the  singhalaese should know the politics of Sri Lanka.
RW 🔛🔝
3 rd place in the election is still a disgrace for srilankan people given his rude attitude and lack of governance ability!!!
I'm 12 minutes in and this guy can't answer a simple question. His constant rambling is annoying. Good grief...
This is srilankan dxxxxx fxxx
Ranil won !! 💯🔥💪that's it.....❤️  Many fools can't understand this...🤣
Bro's cooked
This is the first time i seen a fantastic interview done buy a great journalist no srilankan journalist will have the back bone ask these questions thank you Mr journalist.
👍👍👍👍
Ranil  says  his  country  is  non  violent  nation !  Why  they  killing  people !  Buddha  is  coming  from  HINDU  ROOT !  This  is  all  political   game ! like  Ranil  doing  with  'mahinda'  (maina)  for  money !  This  politicians   all  eating  peoples  tax  paying  money   and   talking   like  a  big  fellows !!
Ranil Wickremesinghe was nothing but a cold blooded murderer and misogynist.
LTTE diaspora is full of spectators 😂 Unfortunately why is Ranil here, when he came to power in the last 2 years, Gota, Mahi and former military leaders were not punished! (Shavendra.., Kamal) Also, out of JR, Ranjan Wijeratne and Ranil who suppressed the 88,89 anti-government rebellion, he is the only one alive. Find out how Mahinda dealt with aljazeera  Thank you ranil❤ stand with sri lanka against to this LTTE 💩 audience
You know Ranil is a great politician when he successfully dodges all the straight answers. 🤦🏻‍♂️
I asked Mr. Wickremesinghe this question during the interview: ‘When the international community attempted to establish an international criminal prosecution mechanism in 2015 for the atrocity crimes and genocide committed against Tamils, you hijacked it by pretending to co-sponsor a hybrid mechanism and ensured its failure. Subsequently, after becoming President, you rejected any steps toward an international prosecution mechanism. As a survivor of Mullivaikkal, I ask you—why were you frightened of an international criminal justice mechanism?’ However, he did not truly answer the question. Instead, he deflected, avoiding accountability. Survivors of Mullivaikkal deserve justice, not political evasion.
Amazing job mr hassan 👏🇨🇦
Please translate this interview  Because most people’s in Srilanka don’t understand English   This program must watch everyone
Ranil and the bullshit politicians distroyed my county...
ranil is a horrible animal for our land...
Mr Hassan you're on 🔥🔥🔥 Ranil couldn't reply 😂😂😂 Please invite Gotha for your next interview 🙏🙏
Tamil Tiger back 🥺
சிரித்து மழுப்ப இது ஒன்றும் ஹிரு தெரன இல்லை. Aljazeera 🔥 மஹ்தி ஹஸனை சதுர ரங்கன என்று  நினைத்து இருப்பர் முட்டால் ரணில். இன்று தான் சரியான பாடம் புகட்டப் பட்டது வாழ்க Aljazeera🫡
Well, no politicianin SL to face bravly this type of face to face inteview. Whether he gabe correct answer to the question, Ranil was vigilant to give answers keeping the country possition and his dignity. Being veteran politicians he did it well. Well done
Thank you, Al Jazeera, for the interview that exposed Ranil Wickremesinghe’s true nature to the world. The presenter did a great job in revealing how bad his leadership really is. The world needs to see the reality
This interview must be translated into Sinhala and let the Sinhala people  know how he answered.
In that case this fool shouldn't have accepted the invitation very well knowing that it will be full of the Sri Lankan diaspora Sinhalese and Tamil alike. And if he was not prepared to answer the questions atleast he could have been courteous without being arrogant and aggressive 🙄🙄🙄🙄
You totally destroyed this egoistic man Thank you Mehdi ❤
Al jaseera is biased media with propaganda agenda. Will al Jazeera interview Hamas and ask about hostages?
Thanks Mehdi for exposing Ranil and showing his real colour as worse than Rajapakses
Mr ranil your great ❤al juzeer Mr hassan  no knowledge.what is true  he dont no.
I'm a Budhist.🤣🤣🤣
Next should be Mahinda Rajapaksha. Yes he stopped the war but IT IS HIS JOB. No one pats on your head for doing your job. After the war, He dug up buried treasures from all around the island. Our former kings and queens hid them for a reason. Those were country's future saving to use them on country's debt payment. The map of the buried treasure was called "Nidan wadula" it was with the person named Sanchi Arachchige Jinadasa AKA  Maradankadawala Yakadaya. He met with Mahinda Rajapaksha (you can find the news on that meeting) and asked mahinda rajapaksha to use the treasure on debt payment and get the country back up. But what rajapaksha family did was opposite, he used them for his own gain.
😅😅😃😃😅😅😅 probably the most incompetent bafoon of all time. An abysmal failure in every respect.
RW really did a great job againt these LTTE nut  loose audience. Well done
He is not our president he is the one making big rubber in Sri Lanka bank ,
Wow thank you Al-Jazeera srilankan people all happy 😊😊😊 thank you
Badgering your interviewee in a room full of a partisan crowd in not effective journalism. Politicians will always try to be circumspect. It was very apparent that the interviewer had a particular agenda, and it was an exhibition of self aggrandisement. Maybe he should learn from Hard talk on BBC or William Buckly Jr. Interviewing techniques.
I love Aljazeerq❤❤
46:25 ✊🇱🇰✊
For the first time Ranil became involved in a very difficult situation .🤣
thank you Al Jazeera and Mehdi Hasan for exposing this Nephew of the Fox as a Fox himself. He is someone that should be in jail just for his crimes  done in Batalanda. We university students call him "Batalande Agili kota" meaning "one who lost his finger at Batalanda". it is not a secret that a prisoner in Btalanda bit  off one of his fingers. one of the worst politions in the world.
Interviewer is  misinformed and looks like a mouthpiece of somebody. Shows his immaturity. Mr. Hassan  learn about more about SL atleast from 1983 before questioning about genocide.
Culprit ranil
Excellent end statement! Well done Mr. President!
bro mahdi if you were at the sri lanka ur missing by now after interview..
Ranil is a big shark in corrupted ocean!
"These people do not live in Sri Lanka; they live in London. These days, everyone is living peacefully—no more bloodshed, no more war. That is enough. If you want to cause more bloodshed among Sri Lankan people, go somewhere else." both side suffers. this is nonsense.
That article was written by a LTTE to be used later like this. These days anyone can write articles!
The host journalist very one sided and Ask all the Questions to light up Different agenda. Tried to Discriminate Sri Lankan army and war Heroes as well ! Hats off for the President ranil who took the side of his country and i feel sad for the foolish Sinhalese people who discriminate their own country on the comment section. LTTE and Tamil Diaspora you can only do the TV shows and cry   මේකෙ රනිල්ට බැන බැන උඩ පනින සිංහල උන්ට කියන්නෙ මචං රනිල්ගෙ වැරදි ඇති ඒවා රට ඇතුලෙ විසදමු .ඔයාලා මේ රටේ දේශපාලනේ වගේම ගෝලීය දේශපලනෙටත් අවදානෙ යොමු කරන්න.මේ ඉන්ටර්විව් එකට ඇවිත් ඉන්නත් ප්‍රශ්න අහපු ඔක්කොම දෙමල ඩයස්පෝරා එකේ එවුන් . මාද්‍යවේදියා මුලු ඉන්ටර්විව් එක පුරාවට ලංකාව කියන්නෙ කිසිම මානව හිමිකමක් නැති ජරා මිනීමරන නීතියක් ඇත්තෙම නැති සත්තු කැලෑ නීතිය තියන දුප්පත් රටක් විදියට හුවා දක්වන්නත් . සිංහල මිනිස්සු සහ හමුදාව දෙමල සංහාරයක් කරා කියලා හුවා දක්වන්නත් උපරිම උත්සහ කලා .මේ ඉන්ටර්විව් එකට ආපු එවුන්ව අඩුම ගාන ගූගල් සර්ච් කරලා හරි බලපල්ලා. රනිල්ලා රාජපක්ශලා එක්ක තියන ඇරියස් එකට  උබලා ලෝකෙ ඉස්සරහා දෙමල ඩයස්පෝරාව ඉස්සරහා දනින් වට්ටන්නේ උබලගෙම රට ශ්‍රී ලංකාව !
only these bas&*tards cover mahinda as he is his brother in law...also his Financial crime investigation department covered up all mahindas curruption and collected all the evidence and they appointed their attorney and discharge all the charges and cleansed the rajapaksa s crimes..also during his reign they broke the central bank of sri lanka..his friend was governor of central bank at that time and he ran away with help of ranil the joker..
Next sri Lanka president ranil wickramasingha ❤❤❤❤❤❤🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰☸️✝️☪️🕉️🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰👍🦣🦣🦣🦣🦣🦣🦣🦣🦣
Most of the people who posted earlier comments are haters and fake.This interview is purely one direction and questions were prepared to attack SL during War. When  RW did not respond to them the presenter asked questions that he knew (i strongly believe someone had dileberatly fed him those news) would heat up SL people. Unfortunately that plan did not work out.   We know about audience and two panel members very well.   Mr RW truly stand for his country. And i salute him for that.
35:01 One of the key person who was there when Jaffna Library was burned down with their enforced guidance 1983.
Well done madh!you uncovered this cunning fox to the world brilliantly !
It seems like this is not fair ! Mehdi is not even allowing the Ranil to finish what he is saying.
RW 🇱🇰
This is the weakest facing of රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ in any program
As Sri Lankans we never wanted this stupid man to see as our president . Only Rajapaksha family wanted him.
Why did he even went there? 😂
I don't know if the people there know about the LTTE terrorists using suicide bombers to kill Sinhalese people en masse. I think all the people there are supporters of the LTTE terrorists. They have a huge grudge against the Sinhalese people. Do they know or not that 72% of Sri Lanka is made up of Sinhalese people?
Please interview trump !!!
Hey Hasan/ Al Jazeera ,could you please confirm how long this interview lasted? Mr. Wickramasinghe mentioned in the media that it was a 2-hour program but was only aired for 48 minutes. Please confirm this.
Most disgusting person in Srilanka
Ranil Rajapaksha 😅😂😂😂😂
I most like this al jazira journalist .he's super
The ending statement of Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe. ......He had the last word.
I can see more tamil sympathizers here but come and see their life in northern province and eastern province. You are just barking on behalf of tamil diaspora. Still half of the tamilians are suffering from poverty and unemployment.  And who is gonna talk on behalf of the sinhala people assassinated by the LTTE.
MEHEDI HASSAN❤❤❤❤
Next time call other cheaf politician for interview
Corrupted politician Sri Lanka has produced
Until the 21st of November 2024, there was no government and opposition  in the parliament in Sri Lanka.
👏 ❤ Mehdhi
😅it's not easy to argue with a gay, autistic person who was brainwashed by Washington and runs WEF agenda .
Very good journalist ranil is a worst politician in srilanka😅😅
JMJ, O HOLY SPIRIT PLEASE HELP US THANK YOU AMEN.  Sri Lanka was peaceful until 1977'  under the administration of  Mrs,  honorable prime minister Srimawo Bandaranayake, even though we had many problems,  as because she was mainly focusing  the country  self-sufficient,  however Mr Jayawardene who was focusing on his  own executive presidential  ruling, nothing else,  his  government had Higley educated people,  however  Mr, jayawardena  has asked all his ruling party  members to  sign in a blank paper,  it itself evident that   he was established  dictatorship,  and  then from that time onwards  the whole  could can be seen what was happening in the beautiful country, and now thanks be to God  our people have elected a president  among our poor  community,  however still the previous government  leaders and their supporters are  trying to create more more and problems,  and  making  unable  the new people government  to carry on theirs  duty peacefully.  Please pray for srilanka, MAY THE ALMIGHTY AND MERCIFUL GOD AND SERVICER JESUS CHRIST BLESSED SRILANKA, AND OUR BLESSED HOLY MOTHER GUIDE AND GUARD AND PRAY  FOR ALL SRILANKAN AND  FOR ALL OF YOU TOO FOREVER, AMEN.
Thank you Mehdi, you gave what this gentleman deserves. As a country man I salute you for humiliating this man and revealing the ugly side of his face to the world. Hats off to you.
Mr Hassan 🫡
Respect Al Jazeera💪
Ranil 💪💪💪
Hereafter, I never miss your interviews. Excellent job, Mr.... Hats off.
Mr. Hasan you dont get what had been going in this small country. You kind of journalist has put the oil in a burning house and reason to this world bleeding.
Please question the Rajapaksa thieves one by one.
Good job Ranil Wickramasinghe!!!❤️❤️❤️
Have you seen the devil ?
This is like a comedy show 😅
When Mr. Mahdi was asking about batalanda case his energy went down . Its mean there is something behind that... his reaction telling you truth
I am a Sinhalese who is now in the UK. Before I moved here, I had respect towards Tamils as I thought they were literally suppressed by the Majority in Sri Lanka. I never had any estrangement with Tamils as they were all human as were. I had Tamil friends, too. But once I moved here I understood I was wrong. The Sri Lankan Tamils who worked with me started taking all their frustrations out on me. So, my conclusion is that all traumatic Tamil families and individuals,  foreign-born Tamils (especially females), have a different agenda to go against Sinhalese. Will see what happens
Same thing going to happen in malaysia
We have twenty million in Sri Lanka. In 1971 and in 1988/89 a fraction of about 1% of that wanted a change just immediately after a new government came into power. They tried to bring that change with guns and bombs and what not. We Sri Lankans as buddhists never appreciate brutality. So, those two governments had to bring them down, what you may call an equally brutal way. After so many years that minority fraction hAs gained popularity by spreading so much hatred to the previous governments and managed to win the last presidential election and the general election and gained the power. Day by day they are proving their political immaturity and impotence and justifying the actions and the decisions taken by thoes two governments to crack them down whatever, the way they did it.  To tell the truth about the human rights commission and the UN, they always try to point their finger towards the governments especially of countries like ours. US and European countries cando whatever they want, but non of these organizations will raise any voice against them. We, our governments were in war against two terrorist groups at the same time for about 30 year before 2009 to protect the peace loving majority of the country! All the time funds were collected in the US, Europe and even in the South Africa to fuel those terrorist groups in our country. Non of these organizations raised any voice against that, too. We are a peace loving country, but the entrie world was aganist us backing up those terrorists funding them, protecting their rights! So, do you say that we the peaceful people do not have any right? Is that what this journalist or a terrorist is trying to say? When the terrorists burn down public property we have to keep quite! when they kill our innocent famers we have to keep quiet! When they bomb our main eqconomic centers, public transport, airports we have to keep quiet! No!! Our governments did the right, and as citizens we totally back them up! If you have any sympathy towards any of these terrorist groups we consider you also as terrorist and let the peace loving people of the entire world know that! You are a terrorist because you are trying to bring a terrorist group back into action, you are trying to terrorize a politician or may be politicians who acted to bring peace to our country! And most of all you are a terrorist because you trying to make apublic opinion that our governments commited war cimes. No, go to Iraq, go to Afganisthan and see how many millions of innocent people have died without even having any connection to the war! You cant raise any voice for them, can you? No! You simply can't! And youtry to show that you are a lion, but you are just a stray dog!!🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Now world knows how hard Sri Lankan peoples lives with these idiotic politicians.
"I've been in politics before you were born" ( wrong English )
Some of these questions should go to Mahinda and co. Mehdi Hasan, why don't you invite MR / GR and co and do this interview? Get the same audience and get the same panelists and try it out. Can you? I bet you CANNOT!
The interviewer is not allowing Mr. Ranil to talk... he's just blabbering, blabbering...
As usual he tried to act as a Joker but actually he have to faced to journalist. This is the   truth he is mad joker
Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country. There are many conspiracies underway to erase it. What Ranil said was not broadcast. Why was what he said about Buddhism and the great monk of Malwatte removed? Al Jazeera has proven to be a media outlet full of gossip. This announcer has brought Al Jazeera into disrepute. Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe is a hero. He stood up for the country. The entire country respects him.
Dear Sri Lankans, this person was sorrounded by Tamil diaspora and they were trying their level best to prove that Sri Lanka did war crimes.Mehedi Hasan gave a fundamentally wrong definition to Sri Lankan Military operations against LTTE terrorists by calling it as a Civil War. We shouldn't support this Tamil diapora guys who have no worth of the blood, sweat and tears of our fallen war heros.
Thanks Al-Jazeera
You guys interviewed the correct person and you guys just asked the questions that were going on in many Srilankan's head.
😂😂😂
What a embarrassment , not only you but also Srilanka. shame on you Ranil rajapaksha.
Ranil rajapakase  🤯 never expected..
Why are you only talking about the victims of North and East? How about the victims of the other part of the country? Do you think those people who were killed from the other part of the country are useless? Justice is justice whether they are from North or South.
when was the last time islamic sympathizers Mehdi and his puppet masters Qatar invite any third world muslim country's leader and questioned like this ?
I am really thanks for your asking questions about previous year's happened in Sri Lanka.
he is not a perfect president and most of the complains against him also justice but this is not the way to interview or attack someone
Such a disrespectful journalist !!!!!!!!
Hasan is a horrible journalist
Spot on, Thank you Aljazeera
ඊලග පාර ලපයා ගේමු 😂😂
When talking about visible facts! There is overwhelming evidence—hundreds of thousands of records—showing the brutal, inhumane carnages committed by the LTTE Tamil terrorist group, such as the Aranthalawa Bhikkhu Massacre. How can you deny the destruction and atrocities that the LTTE terrorist group brought upon our country?  Are you really going to call these suicide bombers and terrorists freedom fighters? That's absurd. We were terrorized as bombs went off in buses across the country during the war, killing hundreds of Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, and Christian civilians.  At any rate, we are crystal clear that the truth will prevail, and baseless allegations will be ruled out. Separatist efforts will definitely be in vain.
Only here for Mehdi Hasan! My favorite journalist from the UK
The fact that I don't understand about Mehdi Hasan is that why is he not letting RW finish his answers. This is not how you question. RW is ready to give his answers but this journalist is not letting him to do. First learn the basics and then come to the show. This is not how you treat a famous figure.
It was Rajapaksha who made him the president after the Aragalaya in order to protect the Rajapaksha family. They need only power and Ranil was also craving for power
Hitler of Sri Lanka.
Ranil is so intelligent and matured.  The journalist is a preoccupied person
Ranil GOTA GO Home
RW 💚
Back in 2013, Basil Rajapaksa didn’t know ‘no contest’ like Ranil does today ....he just limited his vocabulary to ‘kaputa’ (crow) and got a whole brand name out of it🤣Looks like dodging questions comes with its own dictionary 🤭
Just look at his body language and how he behaves when the journalist asks about the easter bomb attack. It expresses how he has tried to camouflage this criminal. This audacious person  prefers that the journalist should asks only friendly and soft questions from him unless he always tries to escape from them in a funny way as cunning as a fox.   The way he tries to control journalists is very discourteous.  As a former leader, although he should respond these questions  as a responsible person  he behaves like a comedian.   He is absolutely one of the leaders who has significantly contributed  to this economic crisis in Sri Lanka but he   always tries to show off that he is a great leader.
Journalist need to be trained. He does not know how to respect to the guest. when Journalist asking the questions he never say Mr. ranil wickramasinghe , He just called by name only. I think he did that purposely which is shame on him and to AL Jazeera .
I love ranil wickramasinghe. And I hate jvp because they they are traitors.
Next chance should go to Namal
What kind of journalism are we praising here?  Not letting the other person explain a point and not knowing how to conduct a conversation. Leave the politics aside.. Typical Chamuditha type..
take anura
We are really glad to see our current president next time on the stage with you guys 😂
Straight forward journalist .best man for these rude politicians
Mr. Hassan, our respects to you! No journalist in Sri Lanka has been able to expose the man you laid bare in half a century. There's a specific reason for this. When faced with a critical question, he evades it by shifting between being a historian, a philosopher, or a comedian. The way you've read him is commendable. You never allowed him to escape. Thank you thousands of times for exposing him, a wolf in sheep's clothing, masquerading as a great democrat and humanitarian internationally. May you have more courage and strength to expose such two-faced politicians in other countries as well.
real head to head..hats off you mr.hasan and aljazeera
This mf is clearly responsible to Batalanda. And many things. Lot of guys saying that he is a big brain, but the same time he is a stupid mf who fcked up a beautiful country & peoples lives. As a youngster im suffering today because of these mf's. May god bless my country & AKD build the country for goodness..!
What a childish jocker
Not giving reasonable time for other person to answer questions makes great interview😂😂😂
Thanks al Jazeera  to bring few issues to light  but lot about indian origines sri lankans where they are just human without rights they live in dark without the help of Sri Lanka as well as india and Britain who brought them to sri lanka
Call someone from the rsjapaksha family!!! I have my doubts if they will ever except the interview!!! NON OF THEM WOULD KNOW TO CONVERSE IN ENGLISH 😂😂 SHAMELESS INHUMAN!!!
ජනාධිපතිවරණයට කලින් අනුර ගියපු රටවල් ලිස්ට් එක බැලුවනම් හොඳට තේරුම් ගන්න පුළුවන් අනුර කවුරු එක්කද deal  දැම්මෙ කියලා. කැනඩාවෙ, UK වල තනිකර ඉන්නෙ LTTE ඩයස්පෝරාව. දැන් ඉතින් දුන් පොරොන්දු ඉටු කරගෙන යනවා
like a thunder,,thx Mr hassan,,🤝
This man is the one who destroyed Sri Lanka. He wanted to rob the Central Bank..
First of all, I would like to thank and salute Mr. Mehdi Hassan and Al Jazeera media for exposing the real face of Ranil Rajapaksha internationally. Anyone who watches this entire show will be able to realize how much of a liar Ranil Rajapaksha is. He represents and safeguards only the corrupted politicians and corrupted businessmen in Sri Lanka.
Mehdi I can't thank you enough for your work. Am 24 now, since 19 i have been following you and I enjoy your show and learn alot.  I appreciate the fact you set no borders for your interviews.  Please can you interview more or these leaders, mainly Africans because they need to be held accountable for their actions and inactions.  Love from France (although am Gabonese 🇬🇦)
Mehdi hassen should do this head to head with Benjamin Netanyahu and Putin on war and atrocities. He will get answers without interruptions like how he interviewed RW.
😅😅😂😂😂
Ask your presenter to let the guest to speak
No one talks about this journalist not allowing RW to talk and explain. Mehedi Haasen only wants to show off his questioning ability and not bothered at all to get answeres from RW. Hats off to RW for facing this in a chilled form and not perturbed at all. It is the journalist who looses his temper. And RW as cool as a cucumber.
Mir. Rani was not fece to question , he is hiding his feces.  These are all questions you have to ask for Rajapaksh family.  They did all   the problems in my country , and Runil just helped.  Please bring Rajapaksh family.
Ranil is a Criminal in Disguise! He is lying! He is a Hitler! He knows! He is a very good Actor but he is a number one killer just like Rajapaksha's
This one... on fire❤️‍🔥
Al jasira equal to Al kaeida 😂😅 your it shows your chanel logo
We are good country ❤❤❤ come to sri lanka
Hahahahah joker Sri Lankan president. Even he can’t speak English. Look at his face . Joker
It’s obvious that Easter Sunday attacks were done by rajapaksha regime and majority of the Sri Lankans knows that, and as a Sinhala catholic in Sri Lanka we are waiting for the justice to happen, and  we are facing so much of discrimination against us as Catholics because of these kind of politicians, and there followers, sometimes we wish why we even born in this country.
"Where is the report?" MY late father has continously told Mr.Ranil is heartless murders human..he has no concerns for the future of our sri lankan people..very well done to the true journalist and the modern day social media.
if you don't know about the background of last battle, how and what, you can't understand
Congratulations to the mediator.
All questions not correct answer.. same same Sri Lanka
First of all thanks from bottom of my heart❤️ to journalist. No one didn't ask till now in any interview like this questions. Ranil also wil not expect this terror moment.  just it's means a lot for the journalist who asked very very important question regarding of SL TAMIL PEOPLE. salute sir 🙏 no one can replace your brave kee it up
Intervention Rajapaksa family intervention is also in the army, economic and financial corporation. indirectly the army has great power in sri lanka
Journalist without professionalism 🙂
This guy the president is a crooked Buddhist with holy water. Now invokes Ahimsa and is better than Christ and Gandhi. Feel for the nicest Sri Lankan people who can't live together in peace due government drama.o
Thanka yau al jazeer ❤❤❤❤
Nobody really knows what they've laughed , but wait and see—truth has a way of catching up, and no one can hide from it forever. Those who've done wrong will face their punishment in time. Nature has its own way of balancing the scales with karma. For now, just sit back and enjoy the show.
Bro got flabbergasted 😂
Please call indian Modi also ..  we expecting Asian All mafia same like Modi , ranil, rajapaksa family, JVP anura oh sorry he don't know how to speak English... Anyway try this all mafia
It's not a fair interview. It's not seems to be an interview but interrogation.
I don’t really like this journalist. He lacks basic ethics. I’m not a fan of Ranil, but he should be fair and let the other side respond. Instead, he keeps interrupting and tries to control the conversation, which isn’t fair. This makes me think they might have a political agenda.
Ranil wickramasinghe is very good
He doesn’t know how to talk with president
රනිල් හැමතැනකම නොකියා කියන දෙයක් තියෙනවා. "දේශපාලනය කියන්නේ සෙල්ලමක්". ඒක තේරෙන්නේ මීටරෙන් ඉන්න එවුන්ට විතරයි. ඒක මෙතනත් කියනවා පොර.
He doesn’t know how to talk with president
News reporter doesyhave knowledge
Aljazeera is only one side but we know only problem because we are live in srilanka. Ranil wickramasinghe is very good. He only became only two yeara president in srilanka. He helped us to become economically good and peaceful country. Aljazeera not help us. Bad news reporter. Hate you
Now, each nation faces international challenges. Watch, analyze, learn, and grow. We need to think beyond our boundaries. Each country is a target of a network of international agendas. We cannot survive as a nation if we are not strategic. Sweden and Denmark fought for hundreds of years, but now they are allies and stand strong against international forces together. In any country, the media messes things up. Everywhere, the media has been politicized and has its own agendas. So, be wise.
Best interview I’ve ever watched 😊
I have no interest in politics at all. What I don’t understand why other people or journalists are getting involved in any country’s business which they have nothing to do.  In a civil war innocent people die, loads of families lost their loved ones? What do you guys mean by “crimes in war”? What about LTTE killed many innocent people,innocent kids by suicidal bombs? Is that not a crime at all?  Sri Lankans open your eyes. Politics in any country will be similar in many ways. Stop giving authority to outsiders to get involved in your own country’s problems
Ranil is a great leader
Medi Hassen you are an awesome gentleman to condut this interview and do some justice to Srilankans. This was one of the best interviews i've watched during the recent past. All credit gies to you❤
Mr Ranil Wickramasinghe has been never a president elected by the majority of peoples vote...he has been a culprit of politics where sat along side with rajapakshas at the end and being their savior !! This person has been rejected  multiple times by the sri lankan people in elections...Has many accusations on his name...glad eventually al jazeera taking them out !
I was shocked by seeing this as the person who asked questions from our former president is not behaving the manner it should be. You can ask questions but democracy is to give a chance for him to answer with explanations. Without having basic democracy in this interview how come this guy is talking about our country democracy??????? Utter joke  I respect our former president for the way he talks and handle this situation and also I request our president not to give interviews to such TV program channels if do not have even basic ethical fundamentals and if they can’t respect and listen to the people who is coming for interviews
Could u give timestamps just want to see whether he justifies the genocide against the tamils
If watching this you cant tell the atrocities that happened to the indigenous tamils of the island your judgement is flawed
Every action ( KARMA ) has a reaction or  outcome. The truth came out of the horse’s mouth. Air Force bombs in civilian areas Mullivaikkal and black July 1983 anti- Tamil pogrom was premeditated. What NPP government going to take action against this man or shave it under the carpet. Not one of their own!
Tea officially spilled 😅 , Thank u Al Jazeera again and again ❤ appreciate pulling back the curtain , really enlighning 😂👀✨
ද... ද...ව...ව.... තමා 🤣.. කජ්ජා
Great work Al Jazeera ❤. Thanks. Mr. Ranil tried to protect Rajapaksha.
Great work Al Jazeera y'all healed Sri Lankan minds ❄️
Well done mahdi . Aljazeera…. These should be in sabtatIle in singhala people’s to understand.
Great  Ranil......🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When interviewing thieves like this, you should interview someone who knows nothing.😂 crazy uncle in sri lanka 😅
Very irritating to listen when interviewer repeatedly jumps and not letting the answer to be completed.
ලංකාවෙ උන්ට ඉංග්‍රීසි තේරෙන්නෙ නෑ වෙගේ කමෙන්ට් දැක්කාම.
Mehdi hassan you are super❤
Mehdi Hasan asks questions but when the answer doesn't align with his viewpoint he gets argumentative and then jumps to another accusation. As per Hassan, Sri Lanka has no right no defend it's Parliament nor democracy, the president is responsible for prosecuting and convicting other Politicians. None of them lived through this time, have no understating of what a precarious situation we were in, how precarious the situation in the Parliament was, have no clue about what they are talking about, but without having a discussion  they are questioning and arguing with just reading the some interesting headlines. This was not an interview nor a discussion but desperate attempt to get viewers by laying all the wrongs of every other leader on the first person he gets into an interview with.
ලංකාවේ උන් කෝ
He is a serial killer.  Unfortunately  past government saved him. Formar president Mahinda and forma president  Chandrika saved him. Otherwise he should be in prison.
The most chill man in Sri Lankan politics I've ever seen. When a journalist was blabbering and not letting him speak, he still held his ground, spitting facts and even joking in the middle of it all! If you watched this, you'll know who ended up looking like the clown.
All of us Sri Lankans respect the journalist, thank you very much  🇱🇰🙏😇💐
People laugh for Ranil jokes doesn’t understand Medhi😂
During the Ranilla government of the Rajapaksa family, they enjoyed great royal comforts with public tax money. We only know about them from the current government.
மஹ்தி ஹஸன் Rock ரணில் ராஜபக்ஷ socked🤣🤣🤣
Shameless Ranil got bogged down and This stupid idiot Ranil is a shame on Sri Lanka
පල් හොරෙක්ගෙ රෙදි ගැලෙව්වාට 😂 අල් ජසීරා චැනලයට ස්තූතියි❤
The first civil war started by jvp Sinhalese but Sinhalese Vijaya invaiders mahavamsha ideology never change till now including anura Kumara jvp Tamils still fooling by him
Ranil wickramasinhe only need power ... He will do anything for it. We believe in KARMA that it 😊😊😊
His face and actions given all answers to the questions 🤧
My respect and applause for bringing the topic Easter attack and asked about the questions that most of the Sri lankan journalists couldn’t ask. 🥹
Look like shamuditha uncle Left 😂
They ruled the country normally, but their young followers stole a lot. Now we know about them from the government.
He cant win the debate when it comes to mehdhirhassan💥
Wikramasinghe is a reaper
Mahinda Rajapaksha What he did for attorney General  Sriyani Bandaranayaka Rajapaksha Kicked out Her.
My childhood traumas in Sri Lanka were healed by this.
They think that the Rajapaksa family ended the brutal terrorism that lasted for thirty years. In reality, it was the army that ended it, risking their lives for the country and the nation.
විපක්ශ නායක කමට හරියන්නෙ දයාසිරි මැතිතුමා
Thanks for questioning like this
More of the general public of Sri Lanka needs to see this. Please do a Sinhala and Tamil translation.
Useless Journalist
Next time Mr.Anura Dissanayake
Mr.Mehdihasan You Did Good Job and You Remove his Clothes
Ranil was the leader for Batalantha toucher punishment these basters are deleted lots of evidence this was the truthful they deleted whole evidence basters
Mr Ranil  you would have spoken more rationally please
45.48 is the truth
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Great speeach former president mr. Ranil wickramasinghe..
Ranil Wickremesinghe is legend 😎
A leader of thieves appointed by a gang of thieves 👍 During the Ranil Rajapaksa government, these people and their followers stole a lot. Now, when the government arrests them, these people are shouting that it is political revenge. 👍❤🇱🇰 respect MR president  AKD  🧭❤
Awesome journalism by Mehdi Hasan!
Questions must be asked and allowed to be answered, appalling interviewer. Sri Lankans must not undermine our integrity as a country before foreigners. They don't have a right to dictate or have the understanding of the long political history in Sri Lanka.  The government continued to fall and disintegrate due to the political chaos staged mainly by the JVP from the early days of 1970s and Tamil tigers thereafter. It was Mahinda Rajapaksha, the president, who ended the war and enabled all Sinhala majority and the minorities to earn their freedom. We walk and live without fear of bombs and mass massacre, thanks to Mr Rajapaksha. This man, Ranil Wikramasinghe, had the courage and the knowledge to revive the economic crisis again when the country collapsed in 2022. The same political band of JVP members in parliament, including president Anura Dissanayaka, were there then, and no one came forward, all talk and no work.  The majority of ungrateful Sri Lankans, you do not know what you are laughing at.
Sri Lanka is a peaceful and beautiful country where no ethnic group faces oppression. I invite you to visit and see it for yourself.  Regarding the violence you mention—are you suggesting that we should have remained silent while our nation was threatened by a terrorist group? As a sovereign country with a history spanning over 2,500 years, we had every right to defend our territorial integrity.  How can a war be won without using force when the opposing side—LTTE—was carrying out suicide bombings and massacring civilians? Defending one’s country is not a crime; it is a duty. Sri Lanka fought to protect its people and preserve its unity.
Ranil is just a cunning 🦊, escaping questions and accountability. Hats off to the journalist who exposed the fox’s true colors to the world.  This interview truly healed me 😇
ரனில் நரியின் வால் அறுந்த தருனம்!! 😂
Thank you thank you so much Al Jazeera media👌👌👍👍👍❤❤❤❤
He really made himself look like a clown here, if only the sri lankan people could see this in sinhala
Just publish a Sinhala dubbed version or at least one with Sinhala subtitles.  All Sri Lankans must see this.!!!
Ranil was unable to provide a response to the journalist’s inquiries.
🎉🎉🎉Al Jazeera thank you for  truthful  questions and reporting .  Ranil-silent killer and crime of key
First time meet real journalist
He is a cunning fox.      He is one of the corrupt politicians who allowed corruption, fraud, theft and human killings to destroy a beautiful country.    A corrupt ruler who brought the country to a place where even the protection of the law is not fair for a common man.    Those questions  of a few people around him are just a joke to a vile ruler who has made the lives of millions of people miserable in the country.
Put it on the jail him
Ranil's trouser getting darker 🐑
Please bring Mahinda for season 2
One sided biased journalist.  You are not a journalist.  His goal was to embarrass Mr. Ranil.
❤
Impressive interview the journalist really dug deep
No one likes Ranil because he is not a people's leader. However, in this context, what I understand is that the Tamil diaspora  expected Sri Lanka to face further economic and political collapse. It is true that Ranil safeguards the Rajapaksas, although he did save the country from major political chaos.
too smart fox.
You should have ask Trump to come he might have slap uou and go the way you handle the conversations, You dont give any respect for your opponent and you just speak what you want to speak, Thats quite humiliating
He probably didn't commit any wrongdoings himself, but it is very clear from ongoing investigations of crimes committed by the present government that he helped cover them up.
Should bring Rajapaksas and question about the Easter Sundays attack.  Look at this mans face his face says everything about Batalanda report.
President Ranil is answering very nicely.
Ranil his government was responsible burning down the Jaffna library in 1981 beginning of Thamil mistrusting the Sinhala politicians
😂
Najj is talking nonsence
"Accountability" thats a heavy word for Ranil Wickramasinghe.. 😅
What a stupid notion that these people still thinking of a Tamil elam when every citizen can live in Sri Lanka peacefully.
Disgusting politicians
Thanks AL Jazirah as a jurnelist  Hati off
These people are very upset the war in SL ended
the man with a mission , people didn't elect him as a president  if elected he would have done wonders for Sri Lanka
A Genocide perpetrator. Israel have followed Sri Lanka's same plan with No Fire Zones to herd thousands of people into small areas to obliterate them. As Mehdi said himself.
Shame this Youtuber how he act
Everyone is talking about Justice but still anyone didn't see that.  Every victim's hearts (wole world) are waiting for the judgmental day of God. He is the king of us  and he knows everything. Anyone can't lie to him. He knows everything.
This is typical stinky old politicians in Sri Lanka thanks for Al Jazeera to bring that on stage and thanks for Ranil too for humiliate my mother land Sri Lanka in the world 😢. At least you have a reason to retire from politics now Ranil.  Now Sri Lanka in good hands so please you go home now Ranil+Rajapaksha.
The journalist attempted to discredit Mr. Ranil, yet he did not succeed. It is evident that Mr. Mehdi possesses limited knowledge regarding the Sri Lankan Civil War and its historical context. The war did not begin with either Mr. Ranil or Mr. Rajapaksa. Rather, it was initiated by Velupillai Prabhakaran, who led the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). It is important to recognize that Prabhakaran did not lead a pure struggle for Tamil Eelam, as some might claim. No evidence supports the assertion that the LTTE's leader was fighting solely to protect the rights of the Tamil people. On the contrary, Prabhakaran demonstrated a highly selfish approach to leadership. Prabhakaran remained safely ensconced in an underground concrete bunker with all the necessary comforts and amenities, while his community, the Tamil population, suffered during the war. When the Sri Lankan army advanced against the LTTE, the Tamil community, which was surrounded by LTTE forces, bore the brunt of the conflict. Following these attacks, the LTTE claimed that the Sri Lankan army had targeted innocent civilians, but these assertions were often seen as exaggerated or misleading. If Prabhakaran had been a true leader, he could have faced the battlefield, but he consistently remained sheltered in his bunker, communicating via satellite phone. If he were genuinely committed to his cause, it is reasonable to question why he never personally took part in the fighting. Furthermore, the widespread use of landmines in war zones, an unlawful practice under international law, and the numerous suicide attacks orchestrated by the LTTE, are further examples of the group’s disregard for the rules of warfare. Prabhakaran was responsible for many acts of violence, including the killing of Buddhist monks and attacks on mosques while people were praying. These acts raise serious questions about the legitimacy of his leadership and the claim that he was fighting for the creation of a Tamil Eelam. Meanwhile, Prabhakaran's own family remained safe outside of Sri Lanka, while the children in the Tamil-dominated North and East of the country were subjected to the harsh realities of war. The Sri Lankan government repeatedly attempted to broker ceasefires, but Prabhakaran rejected these offers, insisting on the demand for separate governance in the North and East. This raises further concerns about whether his motives were truly centered around the well-being of the Tamil people or whether they were driven by personal and political ambitions.
Respectful to the entrepreneurship channel
Ranil is a ....... fox
The guy flew all the way to the UK to recite a buddha story😂😂😂
I literally made popcorn to watch this full interview. Something I rarely do even when I watch a film.  As a SriLankan who witnessed the wrongdoings and ruthless behaviour of this crooked inhuman vessel of a corrupted politician, I am absolutely delighted to watch this. The trauma that made both Sinhalease and Tamil communities sick to the stomach after going through the brutal massacres happened during both the rivals and the decades of civil war that followed, was solely created by these inhuman figures. The peaceful uproar of youngsters asking for a system change was attacked by this man and now it really is very healing to watch this man going speechless when his Karma report is shoved in his face.
Ranil wickramasinga he is not correct answer,      Because hé is also invold. War crimes,   That why answer is not correct   He very intelligent fox  in ranil wickramasinga
Saudi Arabian airline cannot carry passengers from Maldives to Singapore
Ranil 🔥🔥🔥
2nd hand embarrassment is crazy
Ranil, how dare you say that the catholic bishops' conference in Sri Lanka is NON SENSE. Please withdraw your statements. your words nonsense.------------------------------------------- be careful with your words.
Ranil make that man like small child who dont know History
Ranil are you holding British passport?  To be a subject of queen am not being Srilankan
broke by the ones who destroyed gaza...with RANIL...ANURA😂😂😂😂.The Zionist..imf.. Aljasaira❤❤❤FROM BUDDHIST SRILANKA🌏🌏🌏🌏 NOT RANIL..OLD LIER..😂😂😂
This absolute clown thought he could walk through with his usual braindead jokes as in Sri Lankan media. And look  at the pathetic joke he turned out to be 😂
Invite the past presidents one by one n question them their history's n their responses.
Mehdi well done
I am a sri Lankan and very.proud of.the way our former President handled such an aggressive, impolite journalist.
Referring to the economic setbacks, the former President postponed elections, increased the price of goods and increased the tax burden, and gave millions of people's tax money to the ministers.   The public welfare program has been cut.  These young people misled the council and inflated the image. A day before the election, more than 1200 million was spent in vain.  He is a criminal.
Thank you Al - Jazeera ❤
World is exposed now to the one who is gone off head.
Rail is very arrogant
Batalanda report wasn't tabled as his school friend Anura Bandaranayake was Presidents Chandrika's brother of that time. Come on Hasan  you could find out this before. Thats why he asked so confidently where is the tabled report. This guy here is the one who has all the connections to rajapaksha's, sjb's, former presidents, MPs so on, almost everyone.
Ranil is a big foxxx 😮
We kindly request Al Jazeera to publish the unedited full interview here on this channel, which was two hours long.   That hypocrisy proves why Al Jazeera is banned in many countries including the Palestinian Authority.
Ukraine war, Middle East wars, Sriyan war the world is not a nice place
One of the best Super Duper Journalist
Al Jazeera covers many Middle Eastern countries, while European nations often contribute to global challenges. Many of these issues are shaped by those in power for their own reasons.  As for the journalists and interviewees—spending all your time focused on other people’s problems? Maybe it’s time to take a step back and focus on your own life.     Real T N U C
What else can we expect from a media controlled by the terrorist organization known as the LTTE? Here in Sri Lanka, Sinhala and Tamil people live very peacefully and harmoniously. However, these groups cannot tolerate that. If you are talking about human rights, you must consider the rights of both Sinhala and Tamil people, not just the rights of Tamils. What about the Sinhala people? Aren't they human? Didn't they lose thousands of lives? So, be fair to both sides. However, there is no chance for terrorism to return to Sri Lanka. These types of media outlets are trying to spread racism, but it won't happen again in Sri Lanka.
Why you upload the edited video .. Maybe a court order push you to drop the original video it will be just like Kamala Harris unedited CBS video
For the first time criminals like him are really facing questions for the genocide they committed and the money they stole.
Hi dear sir, your advice very very good, all the best, From -Jeevan Australia
That was a painful watch. Can't believe our people appointed these people for so long. No honesty in any answer. Thanks Mehdi.
Tomorrow another interview/ story and we move on
Ranil wikkramasinghe is very bad politician he kild lot of peaple 😢
This bloke got it from Al jazeera the crook and minimRuwa of batalanda
I agreed with this journalist and what he makes it up. but, about this war things with tamil tigers i don’t agree. Because its only tamil tigers asking questions from Wickramasingha. They thought they want justice. tamil tigers are terrorist. As a srilankan im proud to say that.
Interview Namal rajapakshe and Basil rajapakshe
this is in not an interview its a one way conversation.. how can u call this is journalism... can Al Jazeera do the same and tell the work what happen to jamal khashoggi as well..
AlJazeera ,Egs  Replies,..... Very very good advice, From -Jeevan Australia
@aljazeera Please add sinhala subtitles for Sri Lankan commoners to watch this easily 🙏  thank you
My personal view about this interview, no difference having interview with Mr Been, Leaders should answer to question in proper, responsible manner, I Did'nt see it on this interview.
Ranil , rajapaksha are the theives criminal creators
Ranil rajapaksha 😂😂😂
We aren't in favor of Mr Ranil Wickramasinghe,but this interview had been edited  If we as viewers have the opportunity to view the full interview we would appreciate.
Next Level Interview i have ever seen in my life... 🤣 Wickramasinghe fuked up
We thought tamils were BAD people. now we can understand why they chose violence.
So called excellent 👌 experience 🦊 fox politician of Sri Lanka got stucked clever news reporter.
Whole interview is a mess. One old fellow Vs terrorists
This person is responsible for many of Sri Lanka's shortcomings
For the first time, Ranil met a real journalist(n)
Good Valuable questions step by step  about human right violation  & without preventing these crimes 😢😢😢😢
Can ubask trump or Mody like this what ever as a country will finish who is aljazeera to do or spk we are srilankans.... And also mahinda hes the only leader ended the war in entire world. If hes currupted people have answered as a country who are  u to ask
Thank you Mehdi Hasan 😊. As a Sri Lankan young generation , we suffered a lot political and economical corruption in sri lanka, which made this Ranil with Mahinda. What we felt regarding the easter sunday attack we know ranil is one of the main shadow planers of it.
Journalist should give some time to answer 😒 that’s not fair..
Rani need be  educated him self. Good lesson for Rani 😂
How disgusting this fellow just imagine Ranil Rajapaksha's attitude. Ranil is not second to Polpot when it comes to torturing, killing and disappearing of people. Such a currupt and disgusting parachute President. His party couldnt even secure a single seat and got to parliament from a  price offer. He let his friend Arjun Mahedra accused of the bond scam which was one of the cause for country''s bankcruptcy. Good to see he finally got stripped on a global format ....
Politicians
... mehdi ... your approach has become tiresome and irksome ... if you want to belittle others, ok, your dog and pony show ... as for me being informed ... I'm none the wiser.  Just like Trump and Vance ... all noise and no substance.  Sadly.  So boring !
This inteterviewer does not know how to conduct a productive  inteterview. He reminds me of the big bully in the school.  I can see many comments here from sri lankans praising  him out of the hatred  we have towards Ranil and Mahinda. But we should  be ashamed as a nation if we support  big bullies  like Hassen.  He is a bias and high  headed piece of junk.
Great thanks  to ALJAZEERA  And   Mr Harrison   for giving this valuable interview  thanks lot another journalists for incense people of tamils & singalese: he Said he is buddiust , God Buddha don't tell killed people ,God Buddha tell prevent all the crime against the human & other lives
If there was this kind of journalism, they would not be alive for that long. That’s the sad truth of Sri Lanka.
As Sri Lankans we respect Ranil Wickramasinghe for the two years of his tenure! You have no idea how he saved Sri Lanka! The Current government is surviving because of his futuristic and sustainabe plans. Shame on you Al Jazeera!
Al Jazeera ❤❤❤❤❤ from srilanka
Al jazeera🎉❤
Mehdi Hassan is a gem. What an amazing journalist. 👌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Shame on Sri Lankan politician failed to save civilians
Ranil treated Hassan the way he should be treated. I believe Ranil should have walked off the moment he was not allowed to answer his questions. Whats the point of appearing in a program like this if its only the presenter who gets to  talk and the guest is interrupted every time he tries to answer a question? Worse journalist going around.
Noooooooooooo...❤
'No contest' in response to alleged war crimes, he has NO leg to stand on. Put him on trial!!
"වී හෑව් ඩිෆරන්ෂල් " ඇත්ත ඕයි...🦧
Poor ranil 🤣🤣🤣
Mehdi Hasan is the perfect host for this, I've seen his interview with Piers Morgan on Palestine. Thank you Al Jazeera
Ranil Wickremesinghe is also instrumental for creating an ethnic conflict. Under his uncle JR Jayawardana he along  with 3 other minister led a campaign of violence in Jaffna in 1981 setting fire to shops houses including the great Jaffna  library & killing around 2000 innocent tamils.
Respect aljazeera.
Is this journalism? The journalist gives his opinion and when the guest attempts to answer another lengthy question is asked. This journalist is known for his unethical and aggressive journalistic style. I don't know why anyone would want to appear on his program. He is aways angry and can clearly see he has an agenda. I have seen this journalist getting roasted by guests from the right ( conservative) side of the politics.
You can't expect better from a pro-terrorist media like Al Jazeera. I bet you got paid well from diaspora.
What a stupid way to answer questions.
The only thing I see is, The purpose of this interview is to justify the actions of Tamils and LTTE done in civil war by compare it up with the human rights violated by Government to stop the war. Some people of the audience are Tamil and mostly look like Indians. And when the war started Tamils and the LTTE was the first ones to attack areas where sinhalease and Buddhist people live. The LTTE members still live in India. And when the war started those members from India came to Sri Lanka to help LTTE members in here. So they got weapons and all the stuff from Tamil-Nadu and support of Indian Tamils. The main purpose of the war is to capture the lands of sinhalease. And spread Tamil and LTTE all over the Sri Lanka by killing all other non Tamil people in Sri Lanka. Almost every Sinhalease, Christian, Buddhist people lived peaceful in south of Sri Lanka has suffered from the attacks of Tamils. Everyday the Tamil LTTE attacks places where Sinhalease lived. They killed all the Sinhalease people who lived in North of Sri Lanka and made it completely Tamil area. Because of those injustice done by Tamils. The army has start to re-attack the LTTE and asked for Surrounding. But they never stopped. They got more members and weapons from India start attacking more.  Because of the cruelty of Tamil LTTE. The some Tamil people who lived in North came to South and asked the government for protection. Because they didn't want a war. And LTTE killed every Tamil who didn't join them.  If anyone who has brain. Can understand the terrorism of LTTE can't ended with sticking into human rights and obeying them. If they do like that Sri Lanka will be only country with LTTE Tamil people.  The only thing I do see is those Tamils are now asking for justice for the war started by them. 😂 They have start a war killed Srilankan people. And when the government stop them by killing those LTTE members they asking for justice. Wtf.  And I can feel that those Tamils are now trying to own the north part of Sri Lanka by asking justice for the killed Tamils members in the war. What a joke 😂
Good lesson for senile  brain atrophied politicians who think they are legends in their own mind.  Born to loose elections nevertheless a publicity seeker wants to advise the world after being kicked out by the electorate. Past always catches up . Kaput
This is not full discussion
Let him answer the question otherwise what is the point of bringing him to the meeting.
Real journalist. Respect Mehdi Hassan🙏🏻❤️
The interviewer is quite rude.
I am not a fan of Ranil , but mehndi is barking at the wrong tree and making a fool of himself. There are more  things he could have asked about which he had his hand responsible for , but asking even the right questions in putting on the wrong person..
Mr. Mehdi Hasan,   Actually you are the best & perfect Journalist.  Great Head to Head News
Mr.Hssan ❤️💐  Aljazira ❤️💐🇱🇰
Don,t ask any question from this old man becouse He has done bad thing for our country.
They are only talking about the Tamil people who died, but there were thousands of Sinhalese people who lost their lives during the Tamil Tigers’ attacks. Hundreds and hundreds were killed in bombings and other violence, yet none of that is being mentioned
Aljazeera couldn't get the words they wanted from Ranil. Ranil spoke for Sri Lanka. Respect Ranil.
😂😂
This interview powerfully expose the utterly blood soaked nature of capitalist rule in Sri Lanka
ராஜபக்சவை கோத்தபய ராஜபக்ஷே இருவர் கையில் சிக்கினார் என்றால் தமிழினம் தமிழ்நாட்டில் சீமான் தம்பிகள் வெறிகொண்டு இருக்கிறார்கள் என் இனத்தை அளித்த சிங்கள ராணுவத்தையும் அதில் பணிபுரிந்த அதிகாரிகளையும் அன்று இருந்த அனைத்து நிலை அரசியல்வாதிகளும் வஞ்சம் வைத்து பழி தீர்க்காமல் விடமாட்டார்கள் நாம் தமிழர்
Why don’t this journalist ask the same questions from Biden? This guy is a sold out rug
And I’m thinking if the AKD attend the interview with Mehdi 😂😂😂
MH could be a bit more respectful. His rush to avoid a proper response from RW and misrepresenting answers is appalling
Please interview some politicians like Zardari, Nawaz Sharif ,Shahbaz Sharif and other corrupt politicians and army generals from Pakistan.
Stupid president No mercy in people in his country was died in violence genocide.
Give his time to him and give some respect whoever is .requst mehadi
Raninl is a  killer
Genocidal President, just like Israel!
රනිල් මහත්තයාව විදුලි පුටුවට යවන්න හදන මේ කුමන්ත්‍රණ වහා හකුලා ගනිව්
Ado ranil janki kalarutha
No one talking about the sinhala people who died in the war....😂 This is not a balanced head to head conversation...
Well done Mr Wickramasingha,, you did well ❤ You guys are not asking how many singhala people have died during the war, that’s very shameful,,,
You dindt ask him about Jaffna Library ..🤬🤬🤬 They burnt a national treasure. Then UNP government tried to destroy the evidence of existence of tamil in Sri Lanka...
Invite AKD 😂
Chamuditha said : මං ඔහොම කෑ ගැහුවනම් උබලා මට කොහොම කියයිද, එහෙනම් සීයා හොදයි මං නරකයි 😂
Salute for al jazeera.stand against corruption ❤
Respect to journalist ....🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 i am a sri lankan...
මේක බලන ලංකාවෙ උන් කෝ...❤
Ranil did a good job for his team as parliament-elected president. Who gave him that chance? It was the Rajapaksas. So, he was loyal to them; otherwise, he wouldn't be able to continue because the Rajapaksas had the majority in parliament. Since he has only one seat, how did he manage? He used to handle things well and played a significant role in improving the bankrupt situation. Most Tamils are pretty happy with this interview. We all know why.
It's better to have a discussion with our new president rather than doing with dead horse theory. The future of Sri Lanka will be a totally different.
තමන්ගේ අසල්වැසියාට ඉරිසියා කරන ඔහුගෙන් පලි ගන්න දේශපාලුවා පිටුපස යන ඡන්දදායකයා තමයි රටකෑවී
No one  vandalised or burnt his so called private collection of books! Or his house in colombo   it was heavily guarded by special task forces! It is said that the books were all removed from that particular àrea , and then a very controlled fire was set up, and magnified , lied about, to get monetary compensation  He created this story as a diversion to cover up  the fact that ppl wanted him out,  they were calling for his resignation, ultimately, they kicked them out, more recently through the ballot !
පළවෙනි වැරදි කාරයා ආත්මාර්ථකාමී චන්දදායකයාමයි දේශපාලුවාගේ පසුපස ලෙවක මේ් යන ඡන්දදායකයාමයි ඡන්දදායකයාමයි
We appreciate for al jazeera ❤ from sri lanka 🇱🇰
Sorry sir it's all your fault 😂😂😂
How could on earth he  answered for buterlanda commission report as he know very well that  he enjoyed those killings as per witnesess  given by who survived or escaped from those brutal camps.And also he is trumbling during the interview that there was not report been tabled even after knowing that commission report was not tabled by former president Chandrika as she did not wanted to be placarded as revanging her main opposition leader.( but the botter thruth is Chandrikas' brother who was Ranils Royal college batchmate Anura Bandaranayake forcefully stoped it tablling in parliament.) Ranil is a Brutal dictator but because of his pilitical friends he has been escaping all aligations against him.)If he would been in a other counrty where is justice been saved by now Ranil might have died in a prison.
The presenter's behavior was absolutely appalling.
One of the best interviews that I ever watched. Our Sri Lankan media doesn't have a backbone to ask such critical questions from our corrupt politicians.
How you get such people on your platform at the first place! I really wonder is it money or some kind of bond... Taking the least accountable people and holding them accountable!  Wow...And Mehdi Hasan is so dauntless... I would really like an episode on how AlJazeera manages such impossible interviews
go jell
Respect.....You.......
Thank you aljazeera, Tamils needs justice, we want Tamil Eelam
❤️
Real journlist Al Jazeera.Thank you.
The most cunning president we ever had in srilanka. 🤮
Ranil ❤👍
Hasan did his job 👏🏻
😂😂😂😂
20:05 it is funny for them dude ,😢😢 they (Ranul-Rajapaksha) don't even care
Hassen, as a journalist you are not supposed to  talk as mad man. You should give enough time to former president to answer the questions rather than start next question before finish first question . In fact you must know how to address former president respectable way rather than by name only. We strongly condemn your stupid behaviour which severely damaged the dignity of Al Jazeera channel
Ranil - Great leader of Sri lanka🤗 Interviewer - Best Joker ever I seen🤡 Also 99% people like to Ranil Wikramasinha because he is a legend💪
He met Mehdi Hassan 😂😂😂😂 ....
People send him home  He has to rest  forever B C S Peole refuse  him He is big chester
Ranil from  1977 he did lot of damage.  His  henchman  Gonawala Sunil with Ranils blessing removed fuel illegally  from Port. He personally supervised torchering n killing of innocent educated poor person s in 1988.
Huhuhuhuhu you sick old man
Mehandi Hassan done ✅ well ❤️‍🩹
Many people are unhappy because Ranil has not responded to the international community in the way he wanted. Whatever the game Ranil played in the most difficult times, it was great.
As a Sri Lankan national who saw through these episodes from 83 riots, 87-89 JVP insurgency,assisination of both Sinahalese and Tamil politicians by LTTE, terror we had in Colombo, dead scared to go to school and come, bus, train bombings even during peace time, mass killings done by LTTE in bordering Sinhalese and Muslim villages to get thier state carved out and leading to final aerial bombing by LTTE towards the end,....all these happened in Sri Lanka. While I dont support Ranil Wickramasinghe personally now, its VERY concerning to me none of the issues  faced by majority of the other ethnicities in  Sri Lanka were mot discussed and many dissapeared within those communities were not considered as a part of this interview and went mostly biased towards N/E tamils.... Not sure what was the agenda for this meeting since audiance almost all were from Tamil background and questions were towards one direction????  Thats not correct and fact is "everyone" in Sri Lanka had issues due to bad politicians, very bad administration led by extremists, also the damage done to the country by LTTE terrorists for 25+ years!!!   Need good governance, who would make a good system,  law and order without racism making equal rights for all citizens belongs to Sri Lanka.... !!!
No one is gonna say this so I will Srilankan army is not war criminals so mind your language before you talk they saved my country so everyone can live in peace That journalist trying and that lady trying to prove LTTE is innocent  Why dont you bring rajapaksha's and let them talk This journalist just shouting and Ranil making fun of it  Thats all Please bring rajapaksha's in and do justice if you really care about srilanka Once again do not say srilankan army as war criminals this interview isnot about srilanka and justice this is just bias
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe is a brave person and one of our best leaders.
Mehdi hassan is a much respected journalist.  I love his interviews.  He asks questions that most ppl would think twice before asking! Extremely forthright, even blunt to a point! Loved this interview in particular, coz I'm from sti lanka , and we all know who ranil is and his colourful history ! nothing satisfied me more than when mehdi put ranil in such a twist, with his line of questioning, Which put ranil  in such an embarrassing situation!  It made  this arrogant scammer/liar/manipulator squirm in his seat !  Bravo!
This man is the main culprit.  He even broke Central bank of Sri Lanka.
Such an embarrassment to the country.
Mehdi…. You forgot to wake what Ranil was doing in Jafna while the library was burning down. He was supervising the destruction of jafna library with 4 other ministers which was one of a major cause civil war.   Man this guy should be in jail. Look at his sneaky answers! Revolting. Disgusting!
Let the man speak. I didn't know the man, so I was looking forward to hearing him speak!
අපෙ අනුර සහොදරයා ගියානන් කනෙ ඇගිලිගහගන්න කියල දීල එන්නෙ😂
Tamil terrist and muslim terrist   and jvp  NGO ,USAid,,  they  have dream it s dosnt work , nobody  because  of ,,land of the lord  Gothma Buddha 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿 Sthuthi Mr ranil 🙏🏿🙏🏿
Best Joker Ranil Rajapakse😂
Al Jazeera, Hats off to you.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Mr. Mehdi Hasan, You are a great journalist to look upon  for upcoming journalist 21st century.👏👏👏
Well done ranil
Yes he is a theif who has stolen the money from central bank and a corrupted politician. That's why the majority of the Sri Lankan people elected against him in the presidential election.But, during the civil war not only the Tamil peoples who suffered from the war. I too lost my sinhalese friends, muslim friends and catholic friends and also family friends. It was the whole nation who suffered from the civil war. And we do not want another war in my country. And also we don't want any political involvement from the parties who support the terrorism Currently in my country there is no terrorism or war fear.We live here peacefully and there is no racism over any religion.What Al Jazeera trying to  do is to ruin the the image of my country and collape the government. Why isn't there anyone sinhalese in the audience who suffered during the civil war? I applause them for bringing a collaped politician into discussion. But if it is to ruin the image of my country and to support the terrorism and justify what had done by LTTE during civil war then it is not a fair discussion. Please come and visit my country to know the truth.
JVP ❤AKD❤
Ranil wicramasinghe = killer
MH asked critical questions that needed to be asked putting RW in the spot. All of this went down the drain with MH not allowing RW to speak at all. The question was longer than the time MH gave RW to respond.  MH displayed speaking not too different from how some MPs used to cause chaos in Parliament.  This ought to have been done with more patience and civility, for maximum impact.
Sri Lankan government Can’t solve Tamil people’s problems because they are only racism 😢 please support for Tamil people’s
කාළකණ්නියෙක් ඕකා! 😐😐
Sri Lankans needed Ranil Wikramasinghe’s leadership. His term in office displayed his abilities, and he produced results likely none of his successors would have the acumen to do and they were plain to see. Sri Lankans needed him. Unfortunately, the single reason he did not win was that Sri Lankans couldn’t make better wiser decisions. And we’re too stuck in the past, to move forward and make a better future, much like this interviewer. The interviewer, does not know how to interview a guest and keeps interrupting him, does not let him speak, and answer his questions. Very disrespectful conduct, and an appalling way to treat a guest on his show.  PS: A lot of his questions are also not questions. They’re more opinionated political statements, in guise of questions.   I have lost a lot of respect for the interviewer, that’s if I ever had any for him.
Star borne from AJ ❤❤❤❤ love this !!!
Ranil wikkrama singha is lai,and his marder ,am sri lanka we are hate him,i dont like him.he is a killer,
Bravo to Mehdi Hasan! The Fox fell into Lion’s cave!😂😂
Medhi is no journalist!! He is a man with an inflated ego with the agenda of the Tamil Diaspora
respect💪
Ranil Wickremesinghe was fixed as president by Rajapaksas using mainly their party representation for their own safety than that of the people.
Hats off Mehdi Hasan for unwavering marks.
අපේ හමුදාව හෑල්ලුවට ලක්‌ කරන්න ඉඩ නොදෙන්න. එතරම් මානුෂීය හමුදාවක් තව කොහෙන්ද
Good interview. Courageous man facing all the questions that was put forward towards him even though he did not have enough time to answer them. Question by question was piled over him. Funny thing is most of the audience was filled with 'tamil tigers'.  It should be a fair interview.
Hi I’m a Tamil Eelam resident but I’m now living uk but srilankan government makes it cover story and lies about srilankan ethnicity issues ok that’s different topic now I’m saying Srilanka economic crisis situation who made no doubts about Srilankan Sinhala government  how srilanka was before British arrival it’s two kingdom some other reason British bring altogether both kingdom a  administration easier run the country ok after British left the country what’s happened   It’s all military action way dealing with Tamil Eelam people so after srilankan economic crisis but it’s srilanka still never ever accept
Thank you.
Respect Al Jazeera....hats off Hasan...❤ Thank you so much for undressing this cunning ,corrupted politician Ranil.. He is a main character who is responsible for the collapse of my country.. He hurts and pollutes my beautiful country in all possible ways... Once again, thank you  for opening this political dustbin...
Srilanka bad man?
being the Prime minister six times and president once in a country that has only had 10 presidencies... I'd say he's at the root of all the political problems. To have that level of power and watch a paradise country and it's people slowly be ruined over decades of hardship and suffering, not only econimocal but safety, security and basic needs compromised, failing citizens over and over again, stealing their money, time and futures. He is just pure evil for finding hilarity and not answering when questioned about the easter bombings and missing persons. So delusional that he thinks he is not the problem. Well done Al Jazeera for putting him on the spot!
Well done Mehdi,and  Al Jazeera a fine interview i should say. This is the cunning fox of Batalanda, this interview exposed how he cunningly slide off from any serious questions by cracking a stupid joke or quote off from Lord Buddha's teaching. Such a cunning man,he never had the people's mandate, and not have a mandate at all any day.
This channel is my favourite.
Bravo mehdi ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thankyou iam sriilanka 🙏🙏🙏🙏🫵🥰🥰🥰🥰
He is a joke and thank god he’s home
Well this is pretty one-sided. It's always easier to ask questions about what happened than doing the difficult thing. Did any Sri Lankan question Mahinda when he closed off a dragged-out war with the LTTE, where do you think this country will be today if it wasn't completely won, we will have another terrorist state.  Did anyone question Ranil when he actually put the Economy back in track? Even now nobody will question AKD on how he's bringing in good governance and best practices to the fold. But like this, even he will have to answer for things he couldn't do. Well if Aljazeera is asking for a crackdown on everyone involved im pretty sure we'll lose the government an,d there will be civil unrest everywhere. Ask the same crackdown on USA, Russia and not forget the UK, lots of officials will be jail cells. So i think its always best to have a practical approach to things. It's just like everyone knows it's very difficult to do an Oprah but just because there can be some improvements, i don't see anyone from the audience getting up on stage.
Why they haven’t invited Sinhala people to make it fair.
Ranil Wickremasinghe as a Psychopath while his name is etched as a ruthless murderer of innocent youth. He is a mass murderer with no scruples and he is arrogant to a fault. ( He was not convicted/ check the report)
👍
Great leader Ranil ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mahedi hassan only mouth open for this..
Ranil's loss trouser left ...
Universal JUSTICE that came as Aljazeera. Thank you very much. We thank you as sri lankans who love our motherland
He is also raja bakche friend poision snakes
asking for a friend  . Is this channel supporting LTTE ?
An Al Jazeera journalist asked Ranil Wickremesinghe whether he was the one who established the torture chamber known as Batalanda. During the interview, Ranil Wickremesinghe denied everything related to Batalanda. However, the journalist then questioned him again about Vincent Fernando from Trincomalee, who had given testimony before the Batalanda Commission. At that moment, Ranil became flustered and angrily responded.  Vincent Fernando, who was Ranil Wickremesinghe's lover, testified before the Batalanda Commission about his romantic relationship with Ranil and how he had been deceived. He also revealed the horrific acts of torture carried out under Ranil’s orders within the Batalanda torture chamber. He made this statement in front of a panel of three judges. It was Chandrika Bandaranaike, a close friend and relative of Ranil, who ordered that his testimony be recorded in secret.  During the Al Jazeera interview, Ranil Wickremesinghe falsely claimed that Vincent Fernando never testified before the Commission. While it is true that Vincent did not testify publicly, he provided his statement privately. However, Ranil’s political allies ensured that this testimony was not included in the official commission report.  Nevertheless, the true testimony of Vincent Fernando, whom Ranil Wickremesinghe denied, still remains—either with the Chairman of the Commission or with Chandrika Bandaranaike. Chandrika only used this information against Ranil during the 1999 election to intimidate him.  Two weeks after Vincent Fernando gave his testimony, Ranil Wickremesinghe was summoned before the Batalanda Commission. However, a week before Ranil's appearance, Vincent Fernando mysteriously died. Later, it was revealed that Vincent Fernando had been poisoned.  The crime was carried out by Sudath Chandrasekara, a police inspector and Ranil Wickremesinghe's chief security officer.  Detailed records of this incident are documented in the book "Setting Fire to Batalanda" by senior journalist Nandana Weeraratne.
Sri Lankans are honestly so gullible. The UN and America have their own game at play and looks like they’ve succeeded now that the JVP is running the Sri Lankan government. Let’s see if Anura Kumara does anything about the Easter attacks lol.
In Sri Lanka, the most violent political life created by politics and political leaders is a politics of plunder mixed with laws imposed on the people, occupations, and all that. The prominent figures in this are J.R.J. Wardana, Ranasinghe Pramadasa, Chandrika, Rajapaksa, Srisena, Gotabaya Ranil Wickremesinghe, who came to politics at every moment, keeping the people as their hostages, and who captured politics by threatening and threatening the people. The political rules they created are still in effect today. The government that has not found a proper solution to the problems that have occurred so far and the country that has been robbed is still walking around today. However, it is still possible to see that the law is still not being established. However, it is not cooperating with the new government that has come to build realistic structures for the people to live. In the actions against it, it is possible to see that the existing politicians are involved in killing threats, shootings, kidnappings, and government service programs. The most important of these are those who have degrees in England and hold honorary doctorate degrees. All of this should be confiscated. That country should be considered a sinful duty to grant degrees to such people. The status of those who created such sinful duties should be taken away. Finally, my general opinion is that the educational qualifications given to Rajapaksa's son, Nama Rajapaksa, should also be removed.     Sri Lanka is a separate country and we will never allow another country to form within this country or to create another part and create a country with another name. But in this Sri Lanka, where many cultures, many ethnicities, religious ideologies and many castes live, it is an average agricultural country that is practiced as a rotational system. To build this, the politicians who have been doing these atrocities and the military commanders who have been involved in unnecessary involvement in the war should be confiscated and their status should be restricted to such an extent that they should not go to any country. Similarly, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has created such a huge debt on the people, should be demoted from his service. Similarly, considering the economic disruption caused by his actions in Sri Lanka, he should be arrested and an international case should be launched against him and action should be taken against him. My main point is why he should be made a criminal for committing such a crime against the people. In addition, Ranil is the one who created every thief, every destructive family and gang and gave them protection and recognition.  My heart goes out to say Wickremesinghe without hesitation.
Ranil wikramasinghe and Mahinda rajapaksha❤❤❤great president
Thanks a lot  Al Jazeera!
Modi. Break. Religion racial in india😢
If former President Ranil Wickremesinghe was able to behave this way in international media, then imagine how he conducts himself in Sri Lankan national media. Certain sensitive questions raised by the panel and the audience were disgracefully disregarded by him, and unfortunately, he could not play the nationalism and patriotism card with this audience. This interview serves as a case study for all Sri Lankans who have appointed such culprits, demonstrating how they remain silent like kittens when faced with questions from a global audience.
What a big joke. 😂😂😂
This feels like an attempt to bring srilankan army forces to shame.Don't get me wrong, this journalist asked some fantastic questions that srilankan journalists wouldn't dare to ask. I'm not a fan of Ranil wicramasinghe and i know that he is one of the main actors in the degradation of the sri lankan economic and political aspects.I just can not stand when people question small and beaten up countries about their civil wars and crimes that allegedly happened during those dark times when countries that have the ability and power to end world hunger and end homelessness goes on funding mass massacres and wars that happen in other countries and those countries are never questioned.
Thanks for Aljazeera ❤️🙏 Truth comes out on this conversation
ஆட்டுத் தோல் போர்த்திய நரியின் உண்மை முகத்தை காட்டியதற்கு நன்றி!
leave us peacefully westerns
Thank you very much Aljazeria for your information Mr Ranil is always with the Rajapakasa now we know who is behind  corruption this stupid idiot he wants to be  a  holy Angel now good job Al jazzria❤❤❤🎉🎉❤❤we look forward to a better place to live thank you 🤝👏🙌🤚👍👍👍
Can you interview with namal rajapaksha or rajapaksha's family member & also ask about " zhana" who decides about the country. Zhana is a women without any education qualification. But the government gave money for her.. 280 millions for her to build a house.
At last RW has met his Waterloo....the man whose favourite letter is ' I ' suddenly turns to 'We' ..thinks he is God's gift to Sri Lanka...the man who single handedly ruined his own party...what nonsense he utters..he is dictator...his statement of restoring order is all bull....the houses that were burnt including his they took state money to the tune of billions while the country was going thru the worst economic crisis and rebuilt their houses...when the houses of the poor flooded and they lost everything including their children's school books the state during his government gave only a mere 50,000/- ....For once he has to face the truth...he will never accept that they are all talk only no action...
Poor Al jazeera 😂
Well done Aljazira!💐🌹❤️👍💪 Ranil is a Criminal who killed, lied and robbed civilians ☠️☠️☠️☠️ Thank you 🙏🙏🙏
This is why they hate Al Jazeera. Cause they have people like Mehdi Hassan asking the real questions 😂❤
What kind of journalist in this? He doesn’t allow much time for an answer at all. He’s borderline boisterous and doesn’t come in with an attitude of seeking an answer but with an already made up mind to show case his own beliefs. Disgusting.
This is the second hitler of the world 🌎 interview and arrest in international court, there are no one els to take action against this guys power , inshallah Anura kumara new president will be hero to be honest ,,,
Where did I come from and how am I stuck? My throat is getting dry. I will never come to this political side again. Just leave me alone, God 😭😭
I don't buy the panels as real journalist, they either can categorise as terrorists on media stage, or NGO's who lives with dirty money unsettling greatest courier around the world.  I think Mr Ranil did well.
This is criminal man he will be arrest in international court, Help our country for kickoff this kind of people this guy is hitler in this season . Hitler killed 6 million Jews but this guy killed more than 60 thousand our nation. This guy need to bring court and ask question .
I believe that the person asking the questions should show patience while waiting for answers from the interviewer. It seems that the interview could be more effective if the person asking the questions was more considerate.
As a Sri Lankan who suffered from the economic crisis and had to leave Sri Lanka can say all Politicians are highly corrupted in Sri Lanka, they didn't serve the people but themselves. Ranil is bad as Mahinda Rajapaksha. Hope one day they are made accountable for all the crimes they committed. Thanks Al Jazeera
they destroyed our country. poor leaders 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Look Sri Lanka was fighting terrorist who r with civil clothes and they attacked hospitals . I have protected Tamils who r my friends.  Don't just blame Sri Lanka.  It was a dirty racist start from Tamil extremist and the government not people on ground
Pingalese politician robbed Our Money 💩💩💩💩🤡
Ranil was definitely cooked, no doubt. But why on earth did this guy ask why you attended Rajapaksa's birthday? I think he wants to see Ranil and Rajapaksa fighting each other in real world 🤣
Ranil can playing with only Sri Lankans Buddhist poor people only..
Is this a journalist or a Pitbull? Utterly disrespectful to the guest. This third class journalist has a set of preconceived notions and he is trying his best to validate the narrative in front of his audience. Watch some accomplished highly acclaimed experts in this field and learn from them if you care. Could only watch for 10 minutes it was such a put off.
You call this is journalism? He can question the Gulf  states..he’ll never ..other powerful nations politicians 😂😂😂 you guys having ajenda surrounded by former LTTE supporters 😂😂😂even he talk about what’s happening Nabor countries..
💩💩💩pingalees terrorist allways blame LTTE 😂😂😂🤡🤡
Lots of Tamils in audience,  just one side. If Tamils want separate nation, first ask India to give a separate nattion in Tamil Nadu. Also what Bush, Tony Blair would jailed for human rights violation??? What is this hypocrisy!!!
❤❤❤thank you al jazeera ❤for this
This is why they hate Al Jazeera. Cause they have people like Mehdi Hassan asking the real questions 😂❤
😢
Thank AlJazira for this interview this man is responsible of 60 thousand people killed in Srilanaka in Batalanda, my Dad were killed from this Man team UNP busters , He should be punished.   for al l brutally innocent civilians killing the nature will give the revenge
Arjuna mahendran දාල මහ බැංකුව කොල්ල කෑව මේ ආතා....
This is a real journalist 👍👍 Can you invite Basil Rajapaksa for a similar interview "Kaputta kaakaakaa"
𝐘𝐞𝐬, “𝐰𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐚𝐧𝐬, 𝐚 𝐧𝐨𝐧-𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧”, but we cannot accept terrorism and extrinsic violence that threatens our sovereignty and peace. Al Jazeera and Hassan Mehdi must learn about Himalayan history before conducting such interviews or making claims that disregard the truth. As we move forward, it is important to remember the power of truth, honesty, and humanity. As the poet Rumi once said:  "𝑹𝒂𝒊𝒔𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒅𝒔, 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒗𝒐𝒊𝒄𝒆. 𝑰𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒓𝒂𝒊𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒈𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒔 𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒔, 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓."
suddo.
Ranil  Wickramasinghe is not Buddhist, his uncle is a former Bishop of Anglican Church of kurunegala diocese. Ranil had a vision to become famous politician and converted to Buddhist. A srilankan can’t be a president or prime minister if he or she is a majorities religion which is Buddhism .
A third class journalist. I am very sad to see such low class journalists in an international media organization like Al Jazeera.
They were hoping for an opportunity to portray the 𝐋𝐓𝐓𝐄 𝐚𝐬 "𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬," but 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥 𝐖𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐧’𝐭 𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐬𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞 to benefit from that narrative in the interview. His leadership ensured that the 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐦, and they couldn’t rewrite it.
The program was clearly crafted with a specific agenda. The main objective wasn’t to trap 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥 𝐖𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐡𝐞 personally—it was to portray 𝐒𝐫𝐢 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐚 as an undemocratic state accused of committing war crimes and violating human rights. The program’s narrative aligned with the 𝐓𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐥 𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐚’𝐬 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠-𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 to discredit Sri Lanka on the global stage.
As srilanken we  thankful to aljaseera   rsnil is real rascal
Ranil Wikramasinghe  👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Please interview someone from the Rajapaksa family.
As a reputed international media organization, it would be better to appoint an unbiased interviewer who allows the guest to answer without constant interruptions or unnecessary personal questions. In politics, there are no permanent friends or enemies—only interests. A more balanced discussion would have been more insightful.
I think this interview is all about showing Tamil perspective towards the civil war  At leat bring some sinhala people or tamil person who lives in Southern part of the country
We know that USAID pumps money into protests against the former government. Luckily, Ranil was there to step in, take responsibility, and prevent Sri Lanka from becoming another broken country. Sadly, the current government supporters are not willing to accept this.  And, compare to Ranil, this journalist is a no one.
Mehdi is an irritant. Like a petulant child....he doesn't let anyone talk.
Ranil😂, thank you Aljazeera 🙏🙏 This is the most corrupt, cunning, murderous, and deceitful politician in Sri Lankan politics. He is no different from the Rajapaksa family. People who love Sri Lanka should be grateful to Al Jazeera.
Superb Show ❤️🔥
LTTE bombed schools, religious establishments, buses, trains, killing thousands of civilians. LTTE massacred innocent Sinhalese villages. These war crimes are overlooked by the LTTE sympathising, so called " international community". LTTE will never have a sovereign state in Sri Lanka. Also don't forget the massacres and war crimes commited by the British all around the world to build a profitable empire to steal all wealth from nations such as Sri Lanka and India. History cannot be forgotten and media circuses like these are hypocritic. Both sides suffered, war itself is a crime. Best action is to move past this wound without hurting it again and again, and let time, economic and social prosperity heal these terrible scars of Sri Lankan civil and ethnic conflicts.
I like buddha ❤
For someone who segments this entire coversation based on points of discussion, it is evident that prominence was given to bringing up the wars crimes allegations against Sri Lanka reiterating that the then political and military leadership has created a genocide and atrocities against humanity. Whatever that was discussed about the Easter Sunday attacks, the 2022 Galle Face protests, the 83 riots, Batalanda commission as well as the recent economic crisis were only used to strategically steer the entire discussion towards the main motive. The composition of the panelists, the audience, and the questions they asked makes it clear.  Clearly, this interview was never meant to target or otherwise 'roast' RW. True, when one goes along his political timeline, all these incidents have a direct affiliation with him. Yet, the faces behind this interview wanted a prominent and eloquent Sri Lankan political figurehead to be on this platform to elaborate and reiterate on the allegations against Sri Lanka. This was purely a wake-up call for the international community, institutions, and interest parties and tell them 'now is the time'.  But most importantly, the underlying message this entire drama communicates is directed towards the current government, who will find it difficult to handle the international pressure on this aspect. Batalanda Commission report was brought from a retrospective point of view to trigger a deeper sentiment of the ruling party and its patrons. Eventually, they will be forced to align with the desires of the above. A country without a direction, a state without the rule of command, a vulnerable economy, and a collapse of institutions will drive the nation towards an unforeseen abyss with a loss of sovereignty.
This is epic 😂
We are an independent country. We can solve our problems without  other Conspirators. We strong enough as a Proud Nation With our government.
Why can’t Al Jazeera interview and question world leaders from powerful countries? They always focus on what they call “third-world countries.”  As Sri Lankans, we have our own legal system to handle corruption properly. But these interviewers and their panels like to highlight issues in Sri Lanka, such as crimes and corruption.  For example, after we ended a 30-year civil war, they interviewed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now, when our financial crisis is somewhat under control, they interview former President Ranil Wickremesinghe and question his actions.  It seems like the EU and the UN always have a problem when a country like Sri Lanka tries to recover and move forward. This is not about Mahinda Rajapaksa or Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is about Sri Lanka.  Why do powerful media outlets and international organizations always try to humiliate countries like ours? They don’t just criticize leaders—they criticize the people of Sri Lanka.  As Sri Lankans, I have seen many people appreciating these media outlets. By doing that, we are making Sri Lanka and its people feel ashamed. Don’t let other countries and media judge our actions. Let our legal system do its job.
The creepiest politician here ever and most of us hate this Rajapaksha Slave Ranjil Rajapaksha
Mr Hassan, You did justice by grilling this man to get the truth out for so many innocent Srilankans. Well done Aljazeera!!!
❤
Ranil is a biggest
A Very cunning politician in sri lanka, a murderer, he protected many currupt politicians in both parties. Shame on this guy. 😠
සෝමවන්ස අමරසින්හ හැරුනුවිට මේවාගේ ඉන්ටර්විව් එකට JVP එකම එක කයිවාරුවෙක් වත් නෑ.ඒකයි යතාර්තය.රනිල්ට අපිඅකමැති වුනත් ඔහු මෙයට හොදින් සහබාගී උනා.
This is the real image of Sri Lankan politics. Very irresponsible and very much corrupted. We as a Christian feel unsafe and cornered in the country. It's clearly reflected from this dirty politician's response to those questions on Easter Sunday bomb attack. So sad 😢
hey Medhi.why you stopped that MP?
රාජපක්ෂලා රකින බල්ලා
Al-Jazeera are helping to LTTE terrorist  organisations  this people  are clearly terrorist
Al jaseera owner why are you washing other home peoples cloths why you are not washing Muslim Islam country Cloths and Tamils who participate here why your not give good education to tamilians. These Aljazeera staff and owner is washing cloths other countries but there religion and there staff who work there have bad things
Bro, let’s be real—65% of that audience are hardcore LTTE supporters, no doubt. You can see it in the way they act, how they fund all these diaspora NGOs, and still dream about Tamil Eelam like it’s some lost kingdom.  History speaks for itself. Tamils didn’t own Sri Lanka—most of them came when the Cholas invaded in 1025 and took over the north for a bit. Later, the British brought South Indian Tamils as plantation workers. Now, suddenly, they’re claiming the land? 😂 Come on, bruh. Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim—we’re all Sri Lankans. But these LTTE-loving diaspora groups keep fueling the separatist dream from Canada, the UK, and other countries, still funding that dead group.  And let’s not forget the LTTE’s crimes. These guys didn’t fight for “freedom”—they wiped out innocent Sinhala civilians. Anuradhapura Massacre, Kandy Temple attack, countless bus bombings. They even trturd and mrdrd pregnant Sinhala women, cutting them open and k!llng the unborn babies. You think we forgot? The whole nation saw it. But now, they act like victims, crying about war crimes and human rights. Bruh, war itself is a cr!me—hundreds of thousands died on both sides. No “good” or “bad” war. Just destruction.  And these Western countries talking about human rights? 😂 The hypocrisy is wild. UK and USA literally built their empires on w@r cr!mes, but now they wanna point fingers at Sri Lanka?  Let’s talk facts. The British invaded half the world, r0bbd resources, and sl@ughterd people in India, Sri Lanka, Africa—you name it. They trturd freedom fighters, mssacrd entire villages, and even caused famines that k!lled millions. And the USA? They dr0ppd nuclear b0mbs on Japan, b0mbd Vietnam with chm!cal wap0ns, and inv@ded countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, causing m!ll!ons of innocent de@ths. Now they wanna talk about “human rights” and “war cr!mes”? 😂 Bruh, sit down.  Meanwhile, they ignore how the LTTE sl@ughterd innocent Sinhala people for decades. Anuradhapura Massacre, Kandy Temple att@ck, countless bus b0mb!ngs—these guys didn’t care about human rights. They ct open pregnant Sinhala women and k!lled the unborn babies, and now their supporters wanna cry about justice? Nah, we remember.  End of the day, war is a cr!me—there’s no “good side” when humans are d*ing. But if these Western countries wanna lecture us, maybe they should open a history book first.
I can't think of a better example of extremist journalism than this
Please offer ' The cage' (written by Gordon weiss) Mr RW can Answer for war crimes inquiry
Ranil killer of our young generation destroyed our economy  He is big robber stoled and broke central bank He survived only Rajapaksha thief He destroyed our contry Still looking for like a crocodile  to eat this Sri Lankan value
You don't have any right to talk about against to sri Lankan people.  You and your LTTE  terrorist friends You and your terrorist organisation violated sri Lankan peoples human rights.  Your. Media organisation  helping to terrorist
මේ කට්ටියට අරගලය කියලා රාජපක්ෂ පවුල මරල  දැම්මනම් නින්ද යන්න තිබුණා. යුද්ධය අවසන් කරපු එකේ පාලිය ගන්න  බැරුව  හිතේ අමාරුවෙන් ඉන්නේ කියලා  පැහැදිලි. ගෝඨාභය  අත්අඩංගුවට ගන්නෙ ඒ  මනුස්සයා එක  වෙඩි  උණ්ඩයක්  නොතියා බලය අත් හැරපු නිසාද?
Very Good
Respect Mr.Ranil as a sri lankan. He represnt my country very well.after watch this interview I realized world look at us sri lanka once again I'm proud to be Sri Lankan
Ranil killer
😂😂😂
As a Sri Lankan, we really need this interview and we truly appreciate it. The previous politics in my country were very corrupt. The new government is revealing how they misused public funds for their own benefit. Sri Lanka is a very rich country in terms of resources, but unfortunately, we had corrupt politicians who led the country to bankruptcy. I hope our new government will take the necessary actions against these corrupt politicians. In Sri Lanka, even when we witnessed fraud, we never blew the whistle because we did not have protection from the previous governments. I hope the new government will change this and we will have a better future. We are fed up with seeing this corruption. We need justice for our country. They have ruined my mother land, Sri Lanka
Respect Ranil Wickramasinghe 🫡
You’ll publishing edited videos, Shame
As a sri lankan i like to thank Al jazeera for bringing in Ranil Rajapaksha who is a muppet of Mahinda rajapaksha. To be clear i should say no tamils were focused and killed during the war it was only armed terrorist who were willing to kill thousands of sri lankans
The person who conduct the  interview doesn't give enough spaces to answer.
As a Sri Lankan Tamil, I am very happy with this interview.❤
I wish at least one of the rajapaksha's will be questioned here. But they won't come. Thank you for this ❤
He's not budisum, he's a killer 🤮 ranil Wickramasinghe..
Batalanda Commission Report...Thank you for raising the issue that had been hidden for the past 3 decades.
After watching their coverage of the Gaza conflict, I had so much respect and belief in Al Jazeera. I always thought they were a genuinely independent channel. However, after seeing this interview on Sri Lanka, I've come to realize how biased they can be and how they can portray a distorted image of the Sri Lankan Sinhala people. They focused solely on the victims from the Tamil diaspora without mentioning who started the war and how many Sinhalese lost their lives or how many parents were affected by the LTTE terrorists. Did they even acknowledge us in the entire interview? I have decided to unsubscribe from their channel.
Al jazerra fake news
සීයට මහාවංශය ගැන පතල දැණුමක් තියෙන්නේ. ඒකට මොකද මෑත ඉතිහාසයේ සිදුවුණු සත්‍ය සිදුවීම් මතක නෑ...
Thanks Al Jazeera
1) Most of the audience are heavily biased. I'm a Tamil myself and most Tamils still defend the actions of ltte. Seems like they forgot the Indiscriminate civilian bombings by their "heroes".
Ranil Wickremesinghe faced an unfair and one-sided interview, with a bad-tempered interviewer and an audience that lacked genuine engagement. This interview seemed that the Tamil diaspora heavily funded and played a role in shaping the narrative. Despite this, Ranil handled it well. Senior leaders like him should be interviewed by knowledgeable and professional journalists like Stephen Sackur. If the media wants to investigate war and corruption, they should question leaders like Benjamin Netanyahu instead. Respect Ranil wickramasinghe ✊
Al Jazeera Rocked Ranil Siya Shocked😂😂👌
real journalist
Nice tray  Don't forget we are Sri Lankans ❤
The guest was not as good at English as the journalist. Some valuable answers to great questions—questions that had never been asked by local journalists—were lost due to the journalist’s continuous interruptions. He missed a golden opportunity. I think he was more focused on saving the guest rather than asking continuous questions. Now, everyone will say the guest didn’t have enough time to answer properly.  Hats off, journalist… I thought you were better.😢
fake nakia....murederer
shame on you Mr fox
Brave journalist....hats off 🎉💪
Thank you Mr.President Ranil Wicramasinghe, who well answered to the planned media trap of Al-Jazeera.
Salute for real journalist ❤❤❤
A highly competent journalist, fearless and brave.
Oh man this guy is Son of Gun "Mehdi Hasan"
It is so easy for people to point finger at a person later. He took over when all the leaders backed off. He did it the way he can. If you can't understand the realities of that time if you ignore all the facts it is so easy to rundown a person who at least tried.  I personally don't like Ranil but have to be fair and reasonable when you criticise.
A joker can not joke around all the time, with everyone. Here is a sounding proof that the joker will get caught some time by some one at some point.

Well said, Mr. Wickramasinghe. You did your best to explain, and sometimes it’s wise not to answer those questions, as they may never be satisfied. You have been a great leader to us. We know who you are, and you have our respect, and that’s what truly matters. 🙏🏾❤️
Well done Aljazeera ❤ Your media got all information correct. ❤
Even how much you tried to shownup Mr Wckramasingje is a cunning fox ,as a sri lankan im telling you, We are with our leaders ..we can sort our internal problems ,you guys no need to worry about our situations ....🇱🇰🇱🇰What a drama ..🤣🤣🤣i have seen  script like this from Indains films..😂
මෙහිදී වැදගත් වන්නේ,මෙ , දිට්ඨි ධම්ම වේධී නියාය ඔප්පු වී වැරදි කල අයට ලොවේ ධම්ම ඔප්පු වන බවයි !!!
I think finaly RW funked up 😅
The job of the majority Sinhalese is to suppress the Tamils
நரி
Does good journalism mean asking questions and interrupting the speaker when he is explaining? How ridiculous is that? It's clearly very poor journalism. It's good to satisfy certain groups of people who like to hear what they want but not the truth.
This was a lunatic president appointed by Sri Lankan Rajapakse Parliament......not people........ People rejected him in 2020 parliamentary election and sent him home....... Then, this lunatic was appointed as President  of Sri Lanka by Rajapkse led parliament....  Again, we sent him home last September 2024.......🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you so much Al Jazeera and Mehdi your great 👍
As a Sri Lankan Tamil, what I understand from this interview is how adamant our old politicians are about holding onto power. Hats off to the Sinhala people for changing the system and pushing for a decent transformation. But in the north, Tamil politicians seem to have no sense of responsibility—they just accuse each other and never review or reevaluate their own track records.
Al Jazira, BBC, Channel 4 and LTTE diaspora thought if they brought the guy who lost many elections because of Rajapaksha, press him a little and he will say Army did war crimes during Rajapaksha regime 😂 The guy just made it the stage to Accuse Cardinal of doing politics, Said Buddhism is the majority and the government will answer to Malwathu thero before any other religion, Asked a Muslim channel is it ok to Bann the Burka in Sri Lanka if the Supreme court says so 😂 Gave a speech from Budda's life on a Muslim channel 😂 Screwed the journalist who compared Gaza with Mullivaikkal 😂 Knowingly or unknowingly made a journalist show a two page report as the Batalanda report😂 finally explained why the Queen was important for a bunch of Immigrants in UK 😂 That's Ranil for you 😂
Well come to comment section ☝️
The real The disaster starts from 25:25 enjoy the show 🔥☄
Al JAZEERA AND. THOSE WHO WERE SITTING ARROUND THERE  TO ATTACK  MR. RANIL  WICKRAMASINGHE,  FORGET THE FACT HOW RUTHLESSLY TAMIL TIGERS KILLED INNOCENT  PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY,  BY EXPLODING TIME BOMBS EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY,  FOR THIRTY YEARS. TAMIL TIGERS DESTROYED SRI LANKA FOREVER . NOW  THEY  SPEAK  LIKE AS IF THEY HAVE FORG OTTEN EVERYTHING. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHTS, TAMIL TIGERS WENT INTO THE SMALL VILLAGES WITH MACHINE GUNS AND SHOT INTO THE AIR TO FRIGHTEN THE POOR SINHALA VILLAGERS. THE FRIGHTENED POOR FAMILIES RUN OUT OF THEIR POOR HUTS IN THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT. THEN  THOSE RUTHLESS TAMIL TIGERS START SHOOTING THOSE POOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THEY TOOK THOSE SMALL BABIES AND HIT THEM ON TREES AND KILLED THEM SAYING,  " ITS A WASTE TO USE BULLETS TO KILL THOSE LITTLE CHILDTEN."  EVERY MORNING THERE ARE NEWS IN THE DAILY NEWS PAPERS , REPORTING  ABOUT THE MASSACRES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. ITS HEARTBREAKING TO READ THOSE ARTICLES. NOW THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE JUSTICE.
He was jr minister when his Uncle ordered the Jaffna library to be burnt down
Thank you Al Jazeera team for bringing up real problems to the stage.. 🇱🇰❤
Hats off Alzajeera 👏👏
Mr Bean
Respect to you Sir Ranil Rajapaksha ❤️💯🤗
Interviewer went god mode😂😂
නෑව හොඳ නෑමක්  නේද  ටයි කෝට්  දාගෙන යන්න ඇත්තෙ පිලිගනී කියා හැමදා නියං එකදා  වැහි වලාවේ  I respected who interviewed  This rascal  to maid nekit  It's super I ever seem 😂😂😂
I can't thank you enough for the incredible interview you conducted! Your skilful questioning and insightful approach revealed the underlying truths behind Ranil's democratic facade. It was impressive to see how you navigated the conversation to uncover the realities that often remain hidden from public view. Your efforts in shedding light on these important issues are truly commendable.
There is no Racism in Sri Lanka, Plz dont create a New one If you realy love tamil peple visit sri lanla, and help who need it
Thanks for revealing real ranil
shame to ranil ,who was the did bad and bullshit  thing to sri lanka with mahinda
Sri Lankans are  not against Tamil  , we against to Terrorism.
Bla bla bla Ranil
He will pay for his sins nocturnal  animal
From this i learn,  how patience he is while everyone jumping emotionally 😅😅😅😅 , he alr won 😅😅😅  He going to be president soon again 😅😅😅😅
Ranil culprit
I would have appreciated it if they had let Ranil Wickremesinghe finish what he was trying to say. He may not speak as fast as the journalist, but that does not mean his responses should be cut off before they are fully articulated. While each person has their own opinions and facts, I wanted the opportunity to understand his perspective and learn something new.  Not all of us research extensively, and this could have been a moment to hear his rationale on key issues—whether one agrees with him or not. Instead, much of the discussion was dominated by accusations and interruptions, making it difficult to follow his stance. For example, when he tried to explain his role in stabilizing the economy and the difficult decisions required, he was constantly interrupted with hostile counterpoints before he could even finish a thought.  Similarly, on topics like human rights and the Rajapaksa family, there was no room for a balanced discussion. When he pointed out that legal actions are decided by the Attorney General, not the President, the focus immediately shifted to personal optics, like his attendance at a birthday party, instead of addressing the actual judicial process.  I am not on anyone’s side here—I just wanted an opportunity to learn more. But all I could gather was a barrage of allegations and an arrogant, combative approach that left little space for real dialogue. Give the man time to answer the questions—whether it’s the answer you like or not.
Sri Lankan journalist please learn from him ❤
Respect Aljazeera ❤❤❤❤
Everyone knows what happened and so that the people can't demonstrate he put out a restrictions- not ok
Good job Mehdi, you exposed this idiot for who he actually is. He is a curse on this beautiful nation.
Thank you so much Al Jazeera for conducting a fair interview with Ranil with direct questioning.  Sri Lankan media don't have the level of freedom to question the powerful corrupt politicians while they live inside the country because the following day any journalist who questioned the politician can most likely disappear into the thin air without leaving any traces, only to later find out they were murdered after torture.  This is the most likely repercussion of  questioning these corrupt politicians directly in a way it may lead to exposure of crimes and can lead to discussions about the crimes they handled. Hats off Al Jazeera for conducting this interview in a transparent manner so everyone can understand the reason Ranil and many other politicians were not openly questioned in media interviews held by Sri Lankan journalists. It's because they don't want to get killed for doing their job knowing their children or family are not supported by a corrupt system to survive after the breadwinner of the family is killed.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
If this was done a year a go in SL. The interview panel could go missing and never to be found again.
The pm should be in jail.
Mr. Ranil, you did very well. Every country has garbage. Politicians are not perfect, even so called EU countries.  Other Politicians have no courage to come forward for any interviews. They can't even go to public without security??  Now, Srilankans  ( Sinhalese & Tamil ) are living peace & harmony. Mr Ranil is even good for UN top job!!  Those who try to compare Lk war with Gaza, learn from Sri Lanka ; such as Tamils have equal rights, One country!  No discrimination. Real fair go ,  Scattered everywhere.    For NGO representatives; No war is sweet, but Lk outcome! aftermath the war is very peaceful,   positive outcome,  100% problem solved.  Could have saved 100,000+ lives if war continues upto today.
Ranil did nothing good to jaffna the present government is doing great, stupid Ranil wants to include his name for what present president is  doing
Hasan you should have asked him what happened to his left hand 4th finger. It’s also related to batalanda mass killing housing complex  He is an evil maniac basted 😡😡😡😡😡
All the allegation made by the interviewer are absolutely what the majority of the country also make. This so-called ex-president completely destroyed the youngers' future for 4 decades. We never respect him for destroying the future of our lives.
35:10 His facial expressions show that he is remembering his past crimes.
Perfect.... ❤❤❤❤
Ranil Wickramasinghe great leader in the world ❤
Joker who brke the country
Whatever said and done Mr.Wickramasinghe & Mr.Rajapaksha got the attention of international community, again! Rather putting blame on them it’s time current SL Government do something about it other than just pointing fingers and empty words. Otherwise they will have to face the same fate as them ultimately.
Ranil wickramasignhe was responsible for the deaths of many people in Srilanka.
Some times we have to agree with wickramasinghe because as  diaspora charging about sl army about carrying war crimes in the later part of the civil war , but why any one standing about the sinhalase people who killed in thousands of suicide bombing take place on every part of country . Why only tamils are consider as the ones who have suffered the most.yeah its agreeble because civil war takes placed on north and east where most of the lands taken by tamils at that time. Why they having a law called 'thesawalamai law' upto today. Can you diaspora based people explain about that. It is a very questionable law arrangement for tamils in srilanka. It is very sad when it comes to tamils who faced in the war but in last half of the war ltte led by prabakaran used tamil people as a sheild until he finds a way to escape the country .if the army let him to leave the country what will happen then?   Yeah its clear that sinhala buddhist wants this war to be ended and stop the deaths in both sides. Some in this audience are from srilanka but they do not have that 'srilankan ' idea on their minds . They just only want justice for tamils. What about sinhalese and other ethincs group who had faced in bombing and other killings done by ltte.   All must get the equality in every aspect in srilanka. We praise sl army about ending this war .because they have fight against terrorists who takes weapons against them.
Best interview
Karma has a way of balancing things, and it seems that the forces of nature are now calling Ranil to face accountability.
In 02:24, Mr Ranil ❌ Mr Bean ✅
Ranil think every question is a joke, he try to slip away from every question, finally he got the right person , he is a murderer , ask about the batakande case , Ranil was leading the  batalande cases, he was killing thousands of people
Someone should translate the whole conversation because most people dont understand this.... Im really happy about this programme and it healed me ❤️🔥
As a Sri Lankan, I really respect the way the reporter handled this interview. Ranil Wickramasinghe thought and still thinks he is invincincible and no one can argue with him. But the majority people in Sri Lanka had never trusted Ranil. They never made him the Head of the Country by voting him. The only way Ranil became the President was by making a deal with Rajapaksas. From the very beginning, Ranil, Chandrika, Mahinda and majority of those so called parliament (including oppsotion) were working together for their existence. They, from the very beginning are the Enemy of the People in Sri Lanka.
This one has been a major part of the corrupted system, and a kind of morally compromised dictator who played dirty games .
Good job done by a Al jazeera.❤❤❤ Tks Aljazeera. Questioning the trueth.
Ranil think every question is a joke, he try to slip away from every question, finally he got the right person , he is a murderer
Mehdi got a dose of his own medicine. Outsmarted by the witty RW.
This muppet has done lots of damage to Sri Lanka for any years. This clown should be even exciting in this world.
Good job Mahdi Hassan, he is a criminal, he killed thousands of innocent citizens on eighties.
Please give Sinhala a subtitle to this. Because Ranil's supporters can't understand these things 😂
Interview Anura Kumara and ask about the JVP terrorism next time and how they blocked the country from being developed for the last 76 years or so.
they definitely was responsible for the attack. the fact that these people keeps getting re-elected is proof enough that sri lankan people are not right in their heads. No point even trying to change a system where people just act like sheep. Best is to just leave the country and find peace somewhere with less corruption. As a former sri lankan i care more about people suffering in other war torn countries than the  sri lankans and their stupid plight. It's their own fault.
The interviewer is there to only present his own views and very aggressive. That's not how interviewers should be. They need to be calm n not make it personal and confrontational. Let Ranil talk.v
Ranil Wickramasinghe, a man who destroyed Sri Lanka
ලංකාවට සාමය ගෙනාවෙ මහින්ද. එච්චරයි.❤
Look at Ranil Rajapaksha’s face guilty guilty guilty
British tamil forum?     better tamil forum
දෙමළ ඊළමට රටපාවා දෙන ලංකාවේම මිනිස්සූ ත් දැකින්න උනා නෙහ් ඉතිං 🤮🤮
How many people against one man. No evidence... Ha ha ha full of joke. Like what happen in politics in all over the world
Great generalist. Respect you
The World Tamil Community. Approx. 90 + million.  Intelligent, humble, hardworking. Fiercely protective of their Language, Culture. ADMIRABLE ! Unfortunately lacks one crucial item in their life equation.  A HOMELAND !! To that end  attempts were made durung different times at  different locations (countries!) for a Tamil homeland and that dream continues to this day. Amongst scores of articles written on this subject, the following  may shed some light, with more fact, less fiction !) (Ref. TAMIL GUARDIAN. Tamil Homeland Fantasy. March 11 2008). Regardless, the LTTE and supporting Tamil diaspora need the international support and embrace to keep them liquid, for their sheer survival. And they've all the ill-gotten millions to buy the corrupt politicians who are ready to accept without question, anything and everything that strengthens their political survival. Despite all horrors, carnage that befell Sri Lanka over nearly 3 decade of brutal conflict, all communites, particularly the Tamil speaking Communities of the North and East now seem convinced there is neither a need nor a desire for division of this land that must belong to all without exception. Akin to : "United We Stand, Devided We Fall".  Good Luck Sri Lanka.
Al-Jazeera  Media  Guy   looks    like  a   Gangster  No  wonder  the  state  of   Israel    ban  them  is  he  related  to  Hamas????
Thanks aljazeera🎉🎉
This planned interview was sponsored by the LTTE and broadcast by Al Jazeera. There is nothing mentioned about the massacres done by the LTTE...
As the atrocities committed by the Rajapakshas were surfacing one by one Ranil shielded them because he has every reason to do so - they are all one big family! Former President Mahinda Rajapaksha's wife is the cousin of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Well Done Mehdi for maintaining professionalism and doing what you are supposed to do in Head to Head !  Can't believe he pretended not to know about the Batalanda Commission Report.
Ranil wickramasigha most suitable job I think stand up comedian 😂 as a Sri Lankan we miss most legendary stand up comedian and unfortunately he is doing politics now 😢
Great journalist ❤😊
This journalist doesn't seem to give Ranil the opportunity to explain properly... I'm not saying that everything Ranil says is correct... But if you watch the entire video, it becomes clear that he should have been given more time to respond on such an international stage. Because the questions asked weren't the kind that could be answered with a simple 'Yes' or 'No'... When you watch the full interview, it's evident that the journalist had a different agenda in mind while conducting this program... At one point, he even asks why Ranil attended Mahinda's birthday party... What relevance does that have to this discussion ?
They think Sri Lanka army killed just innocent people which is not true ❗️❗️❗️  Why we are not talking about that. Yes Ranil was hilarious but the thing about the army this is concerning 😢
Ammo, this is hilarious! Respect to Al Jazeera for bringing this clown on and exposing him.
Ranil dragged Srilanka to this chaotic situation with Rajapakshas .Ranil should shame about him self. As Srilankans we proud about this journalist ❤ 🇱🇰
Hat's off Mr.Hasan......we had journalist like you but unfortunately they all are killed by politicians......
He had money to celebrate independance day spending 200 million
කජු සීයා
You’ve been in politics since before he was born, but you don’t have the common sense to wait for someone to finish talking before giving an answer. You behave as if you’re bargaining in a local fish market.
ආදරණීය  අරගලය..🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍❤❤
Did someone ask about the bond scam
අපෙ ලංකාවේ ගොන්නු අවුරුදු ගානක් ඔප්පු කරන්න උන් ට්‍රයි කරපු ඒවට වග උත්තර දීලා හාලා ගිහින් මෝඩ යක්කු රට පාවා දෙන්නේ රනිල් නෙවෙයි මේ comment දාලා තියෙන ලංකාවේ හරක්
Sinhalese broke it themselves. Its the curse from the Tamils they killed in the genocide which the world stood silently as a spectators and watched. Karma has its way to deal with evil. Sri Lanka went to massive debt with China. That land is cursed, Asura's land.
Us gevetnment black listed… 😁
He is the most corrupted politician we ever produced 😂
ඌ භයවෙලා 😅😅
ඔයා මගේ style  එක copy කළා නේද ....කියන්න හසන් කියන්න අපිට ...              :   මීට චමුදිත
He’s so fuckd up bro😮‍💨
Most corrupted politician
That's the problem.😅😅😅
Could you please provide a translated version of this interview.. caz majority of sri lnkans dont understand this.. it much me very helpfull to open their eyes towards this matter
If these audience knows the actual face of Ranil, they will never laugh for his silly jokes, Democracy is always a joke for him
Ranil even no eye contact. In  Y view I thought ranil is an intellectual person but he is a joker . Mr Been
The legend Ranil Wickramasinghe 😍😍😍
You know that guy sitting there didn’t get that brown because of heat right?
I didn’t watch the whole thing, because it wasn’t a proper interview. This interviewer from Al Jazeera was terrible. In an interview the guest should be allowed to respond. Instead he constantly interrupted and voice his own opinions. Interviews are not for the interviewer to voice their opinions and not let the guests speak. If that’s what he wanted, he would have done a monologue or a speech.
Please bring any of Rajapaksha's for this program.
SRILANKA very bad budest people
Typical Al Jazeera interview about Sri Lanka... But Why "Mahinda Rajapaksa, Rajapaksas, Rajapaksas, Rajapaksas..." 😅
The last words of Ranil 🤣🤣
Why you did not ask these questions from Rajapaksha's family last 10 years...  Your question very sensible and smart.
PLEASE INTERVIEW SRI LANKEN JOKER PRASIDANT ANURA DISAANAYAKE ALSO..
Finally the culprit faced a real journalist
Sri lanka new prasident Anura disanayaka ❤
Finally someone asked those questions from a politician directly without hesitation. But I think there is some kinda misunderstanding about the war they are like defending LTTE
Great job Aljesara
நன்றி மகிழ்ச்சி 🙏🏼
If only we had journalists like this who are not biased to any parties.
Thanks for this much needed interview for exposure. Please do bring a rajapaksha for the next one .
Who is this announcer he is crazy? One side is taken by this announcer who is speaking, don't buy the announcers to make programs. ????🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
This is not fair, it’s not professional the way they done this interview. It’s a step up, this program try abuses him.
Victims are always victims. It doesn't make any difference. It will never change no matter how much we talk about it ????¿
good job bro pleases take an interview Rajapaksha Family also
Thanks Journalist for your unbiased interview
@ Mr. Nirj Deva i wonder  how much did he pay u to cover his *s  like this omg
Past 17 years they are investigating..we are agree Mr.Athapathu's said
I truly appreciate the hard work of these journalists in thoroughly investigating these issues for the sake of those who have suffered, are suffering, and for the future of humanity. I strongly urge you all to continue this important work and strive for justice.
You did a great job man @Mehdi Hasan ❤
This video raises important points, but it's crucial to acknowledge the full complexity of the Sri Lankan Civil War. As others have stated, it's equally important to recognize the LTTE's documented history of violence against civilians of all ethnicities. They employed tactics like suicide bombings and child soldiers, causing immense suffering. Balanced reporting is essential for understanding this tragic conflict. We cannot ignore the suffering of all Sri Lankan citizens. For more information, I would recommend researching reports from the UN, and also looking into reports from Human Rights Watch.  Furthermore, it's essential to address the ongoing concerns regarding asylum claims by some Sri Lankan Tamils in other countries. There have been allegations, sometimes substantiated, that some individuals exaggerate or fabricate accounts of persecution by the Sri Lankan military to strengthen their asylum applications. This practice, while not representative of all asylum seekers, can contribute to a skewed perception of the conflict. Reports from various immigration tribunals and government assessments in countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia have documented instances where asylum claims based on alleged military persecution were found to be unsubstantiated or inconsistent. It is important to remember that this does not diminish the very real suffering of many, but it is a factor that must be considered when looking at the overall narrative. True peace can only be achieved through acknowledging the pain of all the victims, and by having a full and honest understanding of the conflict.
So many  pro-JVP are commenting against Ranil here with no knowledge
Well done, mehdhi hassan. Hat's off you.
In a serious interview format like “Head to Head” the focus should be on the guest, not the interviewer. The interviewers job is to challenge, probe and clarify, but not to overshadow the person being questioned.  Constantly interrupting instead of letting the guest answer is a bad behavior in an interview like this.  I think Ranil Wikramasinghe answered all the Qs very well. The interviewers opinions made the answers look a bit odd. It was a psychological trick he was playing by commenting after each answer and going into the next question or showing a gesture like the answers don’t make sense. That is called “overshadowing” the interview, which is a defect of the interviewer. Here, the interviewer try to become the star without letting the guest to speak.  I also think RW would have taken different approaches to answer some of the Qs. But in my opinion. RW played well.
Feels they have an agenda.
😂 අන්තර්ජාතික "පොර" අන්තර්ජාතිකව චොර වීම
Low budget Donald Trump 😂🥲
Arrogance is all we hear ! Typical attitude of a SL male mainly. He is abusing Buddhism 😮 he has no Buddhistness . He is another who labels  himself as a Buddhist,  Shaming Buddhism . It's a normality in SL unfortunately . Never trust another who calls himself a Buddhist without being asked what his religion is, it's a mask they  hide behind and do all avil.  They got no idea what Buddha taught .
The corrupt parliament—in these missing cases—killed the people. That is why they are hiding and refusing to address the topic; they claim to be the victims.
Thankyou mr.mehdi hashan. Im eelam tamilan. Mean im srilankan tamil. Ranil is big fox
this man could not talk and clearly stammering and telling lies and much more. he got so much humiliated. people were laughing.  What a shame on Ranil Rajapaksha
Ranil is a criminal no any obligations regarding that, but  other than that trying to conveying that civil war was just SL forces killing innocent people labelling them as such and our forces did war crimes is something western media is trying to accuse us over the years since the war ended, Please don’t bring that trojan horse to the rebuilding nation, We have suffered more than enough from the war and  after the war politicians using the war for their wellbeing all the people of Sri Lanka south,north,east no matter where PEOPLE OF SRI LANKA has suffered enough. Now only we have a glimpse of hope regarding one Sri Lanka so please don’t bring that kind of agendas inside my country. Thank you 🇱🇰
Mehdi Hasan should be ashamed to call himself a journalist. This was not an interview—it was a hostile ambush against Sri Lanka. Instead of fostering an open dialogue, he constantly interrupted and spoke over President Wickremesinghe, showing blatant disregard for journalistic fairness. A true journalist asks tough questions but also gives their guest the opportunity to respond. Hasan’s aggressive, one-sided approach was nothing more than a performance, designed to push his own narrative rather than inform viewers. If he had any respect for honest discourse, he would have conducted a proper interview instead of a biased attack.
What a joker
Thank you, 😊Mehdi Hasan, for asking the questions that many of us, from the Tamil community, couldn’t ask during the war. Your words bring our voices to the world, and after 35 years, we can finally be heard. I’m grateful for the courage you show in giving a voice to the silenced.❤❤❤❤❤
all sri lankans here blaming and shouting by their perspective on the political side of our country.but here they are all fooling as sri lankans they are creating a talk here by address a few corruptions in ou county their major gaol is to deffend and address LTTE thoughs here. This isnt right for me at all. I dont like mr.wikramasighe but he isnt the major problem here as they call. This is a well programmed trap which has been initiated by eelam members of UA
I admit that Mr. Ranil & Rajapakse’s behaviors towards common people was not good. I don’t like those regimes. But, a very few nations were there to help us during the war period. I ask one question. Why now?  We don’t need international investigation for such crimes that happened. A new government should execute an internal investigation with an acceptable transparency.
finally we witnessed ranil getting exposed for the destruction he done to our country
Corrected parliament 😂
Thankyou aljazera 🙏 Eelam tamil anushan
No politicians in Sri Lanka are honestly doing their jobs; they come to power, fill their pockets, and leave, neglecting the needs of the people.
தமிழர்களின் இனப்படுகொலை குற்றவாளிகளை சட்டத்தின் பிடியிலிருந்து காப்பாற்றிய குள்ள நரி ரணில்
This is more than a interview addressing the corruption this is more for the LTTE standers from the  international. Thats all i feels. This isnt right
Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka’s former president, played a key role in stabilizing the country during its economic crisis. As a seasoned politician, he focused on economic reforms and international relationship❤
Hats off for mehdi to expose this corrupted cunning person to world
Invite Trump and ask him about the US funding Israel to kill women and children in Palestine.
Ranil would have thought he could handle this reporter like he could insult and manage like other reporters.
Mehdi u  don't allow mr ranil to finish  his answer      u cannot tame  ,mr,ranil he is master technian
Ranil Wickremesinghe became the President of Sri Lanka after the Aragalaya (GotaGoGama) protest led to the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Despite not being elected by the people, he was appointed by Parliament with the support of the Rajapaksa-led SLPP, which allowed him to take power.  While initially portraying himself as someone who would restore stability, Ranil played a key role in dismantling the Aragalaya movement. Under his leadership, the government used force to clear protest sites, arrested activists, and introduced stricter measures to suppress dissent. Many view him as the main strategist behind the crackdown, ensuring the survival of the political establishment that the people protested against.
Here Al Jazeera completely failed. They couldn't take out their expected answers from Mr Ranil. Specially about war crimes.
Al Jazeera, why didn't you upload the full interview? The original interview was nearly two hours long, while this was only 50 minutes. Is that because the former Sri Lankan president blasted your Mehdi Raza Hasan? Please upload the FULL INTERVIEW!
What was Ranil thinking when he agreed to this interview? Did he believe that just because he controlled the media in Sri Lanka, he could control this reporter as well.   It's remarkable how he shifts blame onto others, never taking responsibility himself. After Mahinda, he might be the most corrupt figure in the country's political history. This guy is a murderer. This interview sheds light on the stark reality, and it’s truly an example of great journalism that doesn’t shy away from the hard truths.
Pease bring in Mahinda Rajapakse or Basil Rajapakse.
Mehdi Hassan is a simp
EU destroyer other countrys for their own good. These politicians are puppets. Tamils don't get too excited.
Great interview!  All Sri Lankan media and journalists tend to protect politicians rather than question them. For the first time, Ranil faced a real journalist. On this platform, he behaved like a joker—just as he does in any interview or speech.  What a joke! He even mentioned that he was born before the interviewer, as if that were relevant. Despite being in Parliament for nearly five decades (half a century! 😆), he has been a failed politician.  Sri Lankans often say the country has been in decline for the last 77 years (since gaining independence in 1948). Shockingly, Ranil has been in Parliament for over 62% of that time (lol!).  Now, let’s bring in the Rajapaksa family members one by one—Mahinda, Namal, Gotabaya, Chamal, Basil—so we can get a clear picture of what really happened to Sri Lanka’s economy.  Respect to Al Jazeera. 👍
Ranil becomes the joker 🃏
He was also one of the main politicians who destroyed Sri Lanka. You can see from his attitude for not answering the question appropriately. Very glad that the reporter tried very well to bring him back to answer those questions. He is a fully corrupted person. Finally, people have punished him forever.
This interview was conducted with Mr : Bean .Ranil is a puppet of Rajapaksha regime.
6:00 Ranil started Speaking blaberish
Sri Lanka owes this man a great deal. He took what no one wanted and brought the economy back
Reporter pathetic surprised rw kept his cool, he should respect a head of state fit to b his father, Ranil was useless, nevertheless should b given a chance 2 answer, just become u r conducting u don't bombard, if I was Ranil I would have told u 2 F off and walked out, u r pathetic
Wonderful and very Transparent interview by the interviewer
I can not imagine how stupid Sri Lankans are applauding the LTTE diaspora-sponsored interview. This is nothing about the crisis in Sri Lanka! This is all about Mullavaikkal!
Him number one crazy man  😡😡😡😡😡 in the sri lanka political
One of the top interviews👌🏽 all Sri Lankan so called “media” should hear this, how to interview a “real” politician   Thank should go to all folks who arranged this interview. Advice to the viewers; don’t skip or fast forward, listen to entire interview pls
Trash journalism. The interviewer was very disrespectful. Ranil should have got up and walked away from the interview.
👏
The journalist did a massive job. Ranil couldn’t even answer those questions. If Sri Lankan journalists asked Ranil those questions, you wouldn’t be able to find that person within a week—that’s the reality of politics in Sri Lanka.
🫡🔥✅
Like police inquiry.
Most of the comments are from those who are to count the Monkeys on 15 March 2025. Have they seen or encountered what the LTTE did to Tamil people, Tamil Intellectuals, Sinhalese and Muslim villagers for over 03 decades.  What about killing Rajiv Gandhi
Great  Answers by ranil wickamasignhe, They could not take what want them from his mouth ♥️♥️♥️
Made the man speechless 😂masterclass work from the journalist ❤️
Next time anura
Respect and thank you AL jazeera
Ranil wickramasinghe is the arrogant,cruel person who was k:$lled more than 50k people in J.R. Jayawardana era. Still he acts like a nice rabbit, but underneath he’s a cunning wolf
In a war no country can not avoid people being killed.
I wish we had real journalists like this with a real strong backbone in Sri Lanka
Al jaserra trying tp blame Ranil.   And it is already  planed.
Journalist🔥
I m in love with this journalist ❤. You exposed truth.. ranil is a psychopath and a mass murderer, destroyed thousands of educated people so that he could rule stupid people. Waiting for karma to punish his crimes bcz every time he escapes from law . big thank you to al jazeera ❤
I want to express my deepest and most heartfelt apology to the Tamil people for the immense suffering they have endured. As someone born Sinhalese, I feel a deep sense of sorrow and shame for the injustices, discrimination, and violence that have been inflicted upon Tamils throughout history.
25.40
He was speechless. He was stuttering. What else do you need. Bravo to the journalist.
Pls interview Namal Rajapaksha or Mahinda rajapaksha. Thank you 🙏
That Man work in parliament more than my age.. but he and his team can't prevent the economical crisis, but now he said I stabled the economy, but everybody in the country suffering with huge taxes. What a shame
Thank you very much Al Jazeera. Ranil is one of our evil presidents. He killed more than 60000 innocent people in sri lakna 😡😡
Al Jazeera - Please check Ranil Wikramasinge's chair when he leaves!!😂
Chamuditha's English version Show down now 😂😊
Well said, RW.😂 Such an ill mannered, boorish interviewer who is fond of his own voice.
Ranil had the Information to survive this!!! Anyone else would have ran away 😅
Well the interviewer and panelists, just want to establish their own impression . Those who oppose RW would be happy to see this. But they just don’t let him to answer and finish his answer!! Those who praise the plot , I wonder whether they agree with accusations on war. However RW battled well.

Can invite Basil Rajapakshe 😅😂
Please get Mr.Anura Kumara Dissanayaka to explain all the facts discussed here, will be aware other sides of stories
He really compared himself to Gandhi. Lol
And the Tamil woman with the English accent - where did she get these figures while living in the UK?? What about the 240,000 Tamil civilians saved by the Army at the end of the war? Why is she silent on that and the fact thst 12,000 terrorists who were captured and rehabilitated and released into society by the GOSL? This venom is due to the killing of her beloved Prabhakaran - the man who wanted to create Eelam in Sri Lsnka. She is mistaken if that is ever possible. Tamils are from South India nut they won't try their nonsense with India.
I don’t understand why people are criticizing the journalist. It seems like some are used to South Asian journalism, where interviews with politicians are often soft and journalists rarely ask tough questions, favoring those in power. In the Western world, politicians are always subjected to tough, grilling interviews—if you have nothing to hide, just give a straightforward answer. It’s as simple as that.
What a fantastic interview. Why nobody raised a question about kirusanthi and tamil women raped then murders by Srilankan forces 😢
General Shavendra Silva was a brave and valiant soldier. He fought terrotists who sent nearly 350 suicide bombers to blow thrmselves up in trains, buses, offices, streets, temples, mosques, etc. killing civillians.  Its a joke to hear thet the US thinks he is a war criminal. Wonder what the US thinks of its generals who went invaded Iraq & Lybia and the hundreds of innocent people that died as a result. Crazy world
I say the following for my fellow Sri Lankans. මේ මාධ්ය සාකච්ඡාවේ මට පෙනෙන වැදගත් කරුණු කිහිපයක්:   1. මාධ්ය සාකච්ඡාව මෙහෙයවූ Mehdi Hasan ගේ සුපිරි වෘත්තීය මට්ටම (professionalism) අගයය යුතුය. Hasan හොඳින් සූදානම් වී ඇති අතර, රනිල් වාගේ ඔලුව ඉදිමිවාගත් වංගු කාරයෙක් ප්‍රශ්නයන්ගෙන් පිට පැන යාමට ඔහු ඉඩ දුන්නේ නැත.  2. ලංකික මාධ්‍ය වේදීන් සහ මොහු අතර වෘත්තීයභාවය වෙනස අති විශාලය. ලංකික මාධ්‍ය වේදීන්ගේ පහත්, සූදානම නොමැති, බයාදු කම් වල අඩුපාඩුව මෙවන් මාධ්‍ය සාකච්ඡා වලින් කැපී පෙනනු ඇත. අනික් අතට ලංකාවේ මාද්‍ය වේදීන් කෙලින් වැඩ කිරීමට හැකියාවක් ඇත්ද කියන කාරණයත් වැදගත්ය.  3. රනිල්ගේ ඉංග්‍රීසි දැනුම ගැන ලංකාවේ මිනිස්සු හිතාන හිටිය fluency ය නැති බවද, ඔහු ප්‍රශ්න වලට පිලුතුරු දී ගැනීමට බැරිව ඉංග්‍රීසි පැටලෙන බවද පෙනනු ඇත. 4. මිනීමැරුම් චෝදනා එල්ල වී ඇති රාජපක්ස අරාජිත සියලු දෙනා විතරක් නොව රනිල්ද චුදතයන් කර  වින්දිතයින්ට යුක්තිය ඉටු කිරීමේ අභියෝගය වත්මන් ආණ්ඩුව නායකත්වය දී අනිවාර්යෙන් සහ වගකීමෙන් භාර ගත යුතුය. එය තවදුරටත් පොලිසියට, නීතිපතිට හෝ ශ්‍රේෂ්ඨාධිකරණයට පමණක් සිමා නොකළ යුතුය.
Sri lanka was struggling as an nation due to racism and corruption .. SInhala buddhist monks and leaders are the main reason for such hatred .. Finally learnt the lesson late but already the damage is done
it is very important to have this kind of good journalism  holding those in power accountable asking them tough questions  I think this have to come to African countries like recent episode of Kenyan politician  I hope to see more episodes of African countries and third world   years back there was an episode of South Africa and Nigeria's politicians I hope we are going to see more from sub-saharan Africa and sahel States where people are suffering a bad governance maladministration corruption and bribery   and gerontocracy where old foggies hold on to power very and don't allow the young people to come in and take over the future of their countries
𝑾𝒆𝒍𝒍 𝒅𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝑨𝒍 𝒋𝒂𝒛𝒆𝒆𝒓𝒂 𝒘𝒆𝒍𝒍 𝒅𝒐𝒏𝒆...❤
Thank you Al jazzeera
Sri Lankan politicians have been lying to the world about everything, including the civil war, for a very long time. Finally,  Al Jazeera exposed their true face. Thank you, Al Jazeera
Sri Lanka was broken by leftists collaborating with Islamic extremists terrorists who also funds these journalists 😂😂😂
Good job Aljazeera 👍
Good Job, al jazeera
How about the stilankan catholic Church taking the ltte flag to pope frances and getting it blessed? What do u think of that? We all know about u all. Wickremesinghe is now a spent force for tge west now. That's the only difference 😂
Thanks aljazira
Respect asking questions like this
Mehdi, I watch your interviews but here you failed.
We as Sri Lankans, we don’t agree with Ranil, and we do not entertain terrorism and the diasporas as well.
Better Al Jazeera take over the goverment of Sri Lanka. Then only our country will develop.
Hey Meddhi, Why don't you have the common courtesy of letting the man answer the question that you asked. I have seen your style before . It may work with some politicians but not with this guy. Let the man answer without trying to be a pop star or should I say 3rd grade clown!😂
The Greatest politician in the sri lanka Respect to you Ranil wickramasinghe.
Bravo PM  for standing against a clearly bipartisan interviewer who just barrages questions but never lets the other side reply.
We never had a Civil War. A civil war is one where one community fights another. In our case we fought the LTTE which was a terrorist organisation. In fact it was the most violent terrorist outfit at the time. It is amazing that a country that defeated terrorism has to be questioned over the barrel.
Can you please invite Gota or Basil to this next time?
Thank you 🙏 ❤ Al Jazeera ❤
Ridiculous questions all biased and completely without basis or facts to substantiate them. Who gives the authority for these questions to be asked as though they are all true??
What a show!!! Good to see a narcissist for once brought to a blubbering pathetic mess!!🤣🤣🤣🤣 and in typical narcissistic fashion brings in Lord Buddha🤣🤣🤣🤣
Much much respect aljazerra actually Sri Lanka economies crices created by Ranil.wikramasinghe he is game planing man.he has maniac.he has  satisfied hism seft by trainsing others  Rali theft central bank and he made forensic report using his  friend audit for to hide that theft .even his colleague  wrote a book to hide central bank theft. All Sri Lankan know battalada crimal cite haddle by ranil wikramasinge and premadasa .they killed more than 65000 young aged people .he is another Hitler
This is one of the biggest crooks our country has ever seen. The amount of foreign aid stolen by these folks are unreal.
You have our utmost respect thank you
One sided interview to discredit, insult and bully a former President of SL. As a Sri Lankan, irrespective of political affiliations, I am completely opposed to such behaviour. And look at the panel? Frances Harrison???? Come on! Why ask her - she lied so much in her book, quoting  figures that she hallucinated about instead of the figures found by the UN. Lies sells books. Why is the interviewer after the Rajapakses? Isn't it because Mahinda Rajapakse led the country to victory against the LTTE?  A very one sided interview.
Thank you mehdi, that’s all I have to say . Thank you for your commitment.
Interview with a old joker
NOT ENOUGH BRO. ranil IS CRIMINAL HE SHOULD BE IMPRIZEN FOREVER
😂😂😂
FREETAMILEELAMNOW
Mr. M H clearly hasnt understood the basic concepts / tenets of human  communication .  Back to the basics of communications 101, my recommendation .  Pls watch Sir Walter Cronkites interviews, if you're interested and open to it.  Is there hope that journalists can be redeemed???
This interviewer doesn't stop talking!
Mehdi...A brave journalist....
This presenter bullied Sri Lankan ex president. Better you look into other countries. Sri Lankan war is over and just help them to develop their country!!
Ranil handled it fairly well. Except for his former envoy, he faced it all alone.
Ranil is not going to attend any more interviews now on 😂😂😂
He was a murderer who was protected by law, his own law
Ranil 😄
Ranil 'the fox' rajapakshe 😂
Misiya meka balanna.
My only question is does Mr. Mehi Hassan exude an exemplary standard as an interviewer, while representing this network, which has requested the same of the public when making comments?  I have watched copious interviews.  I have not seen anything of this kind .  Bit of an irony that the network is expecting a standard which it clearly doesn't require of its staff. Very interesting. And calling the person an international journalist?    The trauma and everything else that was experienced all those years , is yet to be healed on all sides.  Heaven knows if and when it will or will not happen.   Its a nation of walking wounded.  Do folks really think, including the network that they can discuss and get answers to  a protracted conflict that began to brew post independence in 49 minutes, spanning generations?  How superficial!!!  This is modern day journalism???  Amazes me.
This journalist's tactic is giving a questions without letting the person to answer. Then when the guys starts to answer at some point this guy again interrupts. That's journalism. JD Vance was right about this person. An Oxford degree cant offer someone some brain matter and quality. Letting someone to talk is courtesy. He didn't have that. If this is called journalism Al jazeera is in a serious trouble. Anyway Al Jazeera never was a prominent media.
World's best journalist
Ranil exposed- thank you aljazzera
Hats off Mr Hassan
What an idiot, RW.
They hear what they want to hear
For the first time in my life, I witnessed a Sri Lankan politician being rightly questioned. My country is a beautiful place with a strong history and cultural diversity. However, politicians like these have been destroying it for the past 75 years in the name of Sinhala Buddhism.
100% correct he is Ranil Rajapaksha. Everyone in sri lanka hate Ranil. Respect to the journalist
is Al jazeera interview people only to have the answers that they want  them to give ? what kind of  journalism is this !!!!
Ranil is a curse for UNP and Sri Lanka; he has destroyed both to the ground.
Next Sajith premadasa
Ex president faced the interview very well❤.....journalist must learn ❤
Thank you Mehdi, my country is in your debt for exposing this culprit.
Batalanda Torture Chambers, the Fertilizer Factory, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and Vincent Fernando…  🔴 Sapugaskanda Fertilizer Factory In 1975, the United Front government established the State Fertilizer Corporation and began constructing an industrial plant on approximately 100 acres of land in Sapugaskanda to produce urea. Alongside this, a housing complex with 64 fully equipped houses was built in the nearby Batalanda area for the officials involved in the project.  By 1979, when the construction of the plant was completed, the UNP government was in power. The plant had a production capacity of 980 metric tons per day. However, with the introduction of an open economy and the importation of fertilizers, the value of this factory declined. Eventually, the houses in the housing complex were leased out to external organizations.  🔴 Ranil Wickremesinghe’s Arrival at Batalanda Batalanda falls within the Biyagama electorate, where Ranil Wickremesinghe was the MP. At that time, he served as the Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment. He began using one of the luxury houses in the housing complex as a ministerial guest house.  Later, in February 1989, he was appointed Minister of Industries, under which both the fertilizer factory and the housing complex fell. He then designated House A/2/2 as his official residence and assigned House A/2/3 to his caretaker, Vincent Perera.  According to the Batalanda Commission Report, several houses in the complex were allocated to senior police officers who were unofficially working with the Peliyagoda and Kelaniya police, without the knowledge of either the Inspector General of Police or the Ministry of Defense. Among them were Kelaniya Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris and Ranil Wickremesinghe’s personal security officer, Sudath Chandrasekara. It is unnecessary to elaborate on why these houses were provided to the police.  The then-Inspector General of Police, Ernest Perera, testified before the Batalanda Commission, stating that he had no knowledge of houses B8, B10, B13, B20, B21, and B34 being allocated to the police. Additionally, two more houses were used as Ranil Wickremesinghe’s offices.  🏴‍☠ Batalanda Torture Chambers The torture chambers were operated in these houses with the knowledge of then-President Ranasinghe Premadasa and Minister of Defense Ranjan Wijeratne. The commission revealed that six houses were used as torture chambers, four of which were confirmed. Two of these houses were directly used by Ranil Wickremesinghe, while the other two (B8 and B34) were allocated to the police.  It is believed that during the peak period of repression in 1989–1990, around 4,000 young men and women were tortured and killed at this location.  👨‍❤️‍👨 Ranil’s Alleged Lover, Vincent Fernando Al Jazeera journalists inquired about Vincent Fernando, who was the caretaker of the bungalow and reportedly Ranil Wickremesinghe’s close associate. Due to fear, he testified before the Batalanda Commission in secrecy, stating that Ranil Wickremesinghe had knowledge of the events occurring in the torture chambers.  However, Chandrika Bandaranaike allegedly decided not to include his testimony in the commission report, possibly due to political ties. Vincent Fernando, who testified believing in Chandrika’s government, mysteriously died a few days later due to poisoning.  Despite the findings, Chandrika’s government did not implement the recommendations of the Batalanda Commission. During the 1999 presidential election, the report was revived to politically weaken Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, after her victory, it was once again shelved.  When a journalist later asked why the commission’s recommendations were not implemented, Chandrika replied, “If I did that, people would think I was taking revenge on Ranil just as President J.R. Jayewardene took revenge on my mother (Sirimavo). That’s why I didn’t proceed, though there was plenty of evidence.”  ✍️ Chanaka Rupasinghe
Ex president Ranil great explanation ❤❤❤❤
லீடர் ஒவ் பட்டலந்த ரோச்சரிங் காமப்
This announcer should interview our current president Anura Disanayake . He said he has all the files about corrupt Rajapakses
செத்தான் பட்டலந்த ரணில்
It's not enough but this small session proves these politicians are useless when it comes to providing security truth n justice to its people all this jugheads did was eat the people for their luxury  same on him
"Hansard states that Ranil Wickramasinghe was among those who set fire to Jaffna library – Anura kumara Dissanayake" -  So He has to question his connection with the burning Jaffna library.
just WOW
We would love to see someone from Rajapaksha Family 🙌🏾
pure agenda
Ranil did well..❤❤❤❤
Who is this journalist ...he has no brain...bad journalist 😅😅😅
Only visionary leader in sri lanka president Ranil ❤❤❤❤
Salutes to Al Jazeera's rep
He is one of the biggest slave of rajapaksha family 🤡😡
The journalist and the entire setup is totally biased. Better Al Jazeera investigate how their audience is beheaded.
Many thanks Al Jazeera and Mehdi ❤❤❤
බටලන්ද කුමරුනි අහෝ.. බොක්ක දොට්ට පැන.. කුල්ල කුජීත වූ.. බටලන්ද කුමරුනි අහෝ..
hats off to Aljazeera. This is the best interview. As a Sri Lankan, this interview healed me.
Leader with no empathy
❤❤❤❤THENKS. AL-JAZEERA ❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a shame to Ranil He would have committed suicide by now
Dear Mehdi Hasan,  I wanted to extend my gratitude for your insightful interview with Ranil Wickremesinghe. Your thoughtful questions and commitment to holding leaders accountable provided valuable clarity on important issues. I appreciate your dedication to honest and incisive journalism—your work continues to make a significant impact.  Thank you again for the interview and for always asking the tough questions.
No come back for him
THENKS.. ALJAZEERA.... WIE...DONT..LIKE..THIS.. MAN... THIS..MAN...IST..CRUEL.. MURDER....
This is the reality of political system in srilanka,  If they wants the power they will use religious cards and blame one another
I can hear Ranil’s heartbeat
great interview questions by journalist 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
First time i saw medhi throwing his toys out of his pram and needed a nappy change made to look like a kid in front of a vetran politician and a mastermind at that. This is the thx you get for saving an economy and stop starvation 😅
An elusive fox with blood in the hands whose party was responsible 1983 riots and in turn for destroying SL finally ,got caught. He was callous.He has never been interviewed by Jurnalist. He used to premeditated interviews. Well done! Hassan.
If someone says 53% of the people in Sri lanka believes that there was a political support behind the Easter Sunday attack in Sri lanka, it is not the truth. Truth is 90% people of the country knows that there was a huge political support for the Easter Sunday attack and this stupid man who responsible for the murdering of thousands of innocent young people in 88/89 in Batalanda, has protected the politician who support for the all the tragedies with Easter sunday attack. Thanks Al jazeera, for the showing of his real face to the world. He is a sick person, thinks that there is no one  other than him, to run the government of Sri Lanka. His ego is not on earth, didn't care about the people in Sri lanka, but just friends of his inner circle. Shame on you.
Former Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe served in parliament actively since 1977 till 2024. Total 47 years when looking back, evidence revealed Sri Lankan crisis and poorly. He is I believe directly responsible for ruined our country. He must legally be punished
This is called journalist , hats off to journalist. Special thanks  go to Al Jazeera.. respect from Sri Lanka ❤
Respect to the journalist ❤
Next invite that number one thief in the sri Lanka monkey mahindha rajapaksha 😅😂
Mr. Raniwickramasinhe is shrewd politician
Best president of all the time 🇱🇰
Respect Aljazeera 🙏
Thank you for revealing his true colours.
He got nothing to say even he papered or not  but should answer what he did for 33 years of political life
These greedy politicians are a curse to Sri Lankans!
"6000 dissapeared. Is that a joke to you". Yes , definitly. People lives are a joke for him and Rajapaksas.
ගොබ්බ උත්තර දේන ...නිරුත්තර කුරිරුරු දෙශපාලුවා  ..ඉන්ග්ලිස් හරි තේරුමකුත් ඇතිව මේවා ටාන්ස්ලෙට් කලොත් අහිංසකම මිනිස්සු හිස ඔසවායි ..😀😀
Economic collapsed  ethnic tensions & corruption   Why all developments are happening in Colombo . Why not Jaffa ?   We foreign Tamils wants direct flights to Jaffna instead of Colombo  Useless singhalese government why Tamils wants to separate nation .  No reason to blame Tigers
If Ranil was honest and did his job well, he wouldn’t need to dodge questions. A clean leader can answer confidently. The fact that he struggled shows there’s something to hide..respect Mehdi Hasan🫡
LTTE ruined srilanka for 30 years.
10:18 We can hear even his swallowing.
Need a balance of the discussion rather than talking on someone’s personal reading. Interviewer need more reading on Sri Lankan conflict .
I don't wanna defend Ranil, but this line of questioning is so biased. Even the criminal should be allowed to defend him/her self.
Ranil was helpless front of journalist
බරපතල වරදක් බොරු කීමත් samaja gatha කිරිමත්
Nila Sir, lot of respect for you. The interviewer is clearly inexperienced buffoon 😂
every one knows who is was.. lies after lies thats whole reason sri lankan residents want to justice Hopefully its happiness
bring namal rajapakshe also 😂
Well done Mr President Ranil wickramasingha
රාජපක්ෂත් නැතුව. රනිලුත් නැතිව ඉන්න තිබ්බේ LTTE තිබිලා...    තවත් සිවිල් යුද්ධයක් එයි ලගදීම..
Have Sri Lankans gone crazy? Just because you hate Ranil, Rajapaksa, or any other politicians, don’t betray your country. Mehdi Hasan always seems to take the side of terrorism—he has his reasons. Politicians are corrupt all over the world, no doubt, but people like those at Al Jazeera try to target countries in ways that aren’t fair. I’m saying this: hate Ranil, hate Mahinda as much as you want for their corruption, but when it comes to topics like war crimes, defending terrorism, or justifying the Easter attacks—no, no, Islamic terrorists did do it. That’s not up for debate. No one blows themselves up with a bomb without strong religious influence, and we all know what to blame here.

One of worst journalist ever 😂
no report
Though many questions were asked, he made it so clear that he is neither responsible or accountable person. He did not answer a single question to 1% accuracy, all he exposed his arrogancy.
The day Narendra Modi was interviewed marked the end of his career.
Worst leader in Srilanka . Everything is a game for him . Dirtiest man ever . Thanks for exposing him . Greatest interviewer ever. Srilankan interviewers must learn from this guy. People like cunning Ranil take everything as a joke and skip the questions . This time he screwed big time .
The real face of LTTE is not as non Sri Lankan think. All the Tamil diasporas want to have a some kind of ethnic issue in Sri Lanka for rich and luxury lives of them in European countries.
Please interview someone from the Rajapaksa family.
At least, he is brave enough to attend the interview like this. There are lot of cowards who just bark. Try to drag them inside the interview.
United human rights a musted view this journalist's great interviews unhuman rights culprit
If you listen carefully, though Ranil has his own political problems, he stands for Sri Lanka.
this is one of the biggest culprits in Sri lanka.anyone look feels it. he supported his gay friends a lot
Al Jazeera, I sincerely applaud your team for this remarkable interview. This is what true journalism looks like, asking the right questions to the right people without fear or bias.  Watching this interview left me with mixed emotions, satisfaction that these critical questions were finally being asked, but also deep shame at the way former President Ranil Wickremesinghe responded. His dismissive, unprofessional, and almost childish behavior only proved how unfit he was as a leader. He thought he could evade responsibility with empty rhetoric, but the truth remains: under his leadership and those before him, Sri Lanka was brought to its knees.  No accountability for war crimes. No justice for the victims of the Easter attacks. No remorse for the economic collapse that devastated millions. Our country was bled dry by corrupt leaders who prioritized personal gain over the well-being of our people. For years, we lived in fear: freedom of speech was a death sentence, dissent meant disappearing without a trace. And as this interview highlighted, there was clear conflict of interest among former presidents, proving how deeply the system was rigged against the people. A leader must separate personal ties from professional duty, but they never did.  I also want to express my deep regret for the disgraceful comment made by Ranil Wickremesinghe about Mahatma Gandhi. It was a pathetic attempt to dodge accountability, and it further exposed his lack of integrity. No leader should exploit the name of a revered figure to escape answering for their failures.  Justice must prevail. Collective responsibility must be enforced. We are finally seeing a glimmer of hope with the new government, and the truth will come out. Al Jazeera, I urge you to continue this work! Bring in the Rajapaksas, Sajith Premadasa, and all those responsible. If they have nothing to hide, they should have no reason to fear the truth.  Sri Lanka deserves justice. The people will not forget. The people will not forgive.  —A Sri Lankan Citizen: Perera
Amazing questioning my son, none of Sri Lankan journalists has the courage to question this corrupt politician, a narcissistic psychopath
Best interview ever😮💥
It's not head to head but head to bang on Al Jazeera of Mehdi Hassan the terror journalist.
😂
During the years 1988 to 1989, it was not only Ranil Wickremesinghe who murdered the general public, but also many members of the UNP party, including then President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Al Jazeere ❤Respect🙏
Batalanda commision report have suggested proceedings to be followed up, but it never came to the surface as the culprit s were in power and taking control of the legel sector
Ranil kept his cool through this idiot's antagonistic behavior. Hassan asked questions but wouldn't allow Ranil to answer. What a stupid guy you are, Hassan. You don't impress me with your idiotic behavior. Yes, Ranil, let's hope that he will have learned some manners before his next public interview.
this al Al Jazeera is clown
I think He might think he would be the greatest former president in Sri Lanka after this interview. But nicely it changed to the opposite. Most people know the truth and it has much confirmed by this interview. Thank you Al Jazeeraa✌️🏾
Sinhalese Terrorists who run the Govt and Run the Armed Forces.
Can you make an interview with Daisy Achi?
Al Jazeera foul mouth had a good slap from Mr Wikramasingha, . Al Jazeera was kicked and  killed by Israel, what did your international justice gods do ? ... so called educated and corrupt foul mouth are silent about tens of thousands of victims and billions of public property destroyed by terrorists in Sri Lanka.
Ranil  try to leave and escape but the person who interviewd kept all the questions what people want to ask, now he has no answer trying to leave many time, but git check mate.
Bunch of tigers trying to bag a Lion and failing miserably!! RW all the way!!   ♥♥
The 1983 pogrom against the Tamils in Sr Lanka was organized & carried out by the government of the day--- UNP led by JR. The tiger movement grew heavily since then.
Love you Jazeera ❤ respect ☝️
This does not reflect the true nature of the civil war we faced in Sri Lanka. None of them talk about the child soldiers used by the LTTE or the suicide bombers deployed by them—doesn’t that violate human rights? Many LTTE supporters living abroad, who gained refugee status due to the war, are now acting against the Sinhalese and the Sri Lankan government. They continue to threaten Sri Lanka.  Even after 14 years since the end of the war, they continue to claim that Tamils in Sri Lanka are facing problems, mainly to secure their refugee status and permanent residency. One thing I have to say to this audience: go and see the North of Sri Lanka, where the government has carried out significant development. There is no ethnic segregation in Sri Lanka—Parliament itself includes many Tamil representatives. However, those living abroad continue to push this narrative to secure their visa status.
The Sri Lankan government will never have an independent inquiry into the war crimes because they themselves were involved in committing them.
Real terror is al Jazeera
Absolutely pathetic, my dear Sri Lankans. Call me "රනිල්ට කඩේ යනවා" if you wish, but do you truly believe that was ethical journalism? I'm not even going to talk about the content—let’s set aside the sarcasm, political views, and allegations for a moment. Did any of you actually pay attention to what Mehdi Hasan was doing? He never allowed Ranil to fully respond. This wasn’t an interview; it was a staged ambush, a platform to hurl accusations without giving him a fair chance to spak-out. And yet, some of you proudly claim that he 'finally met a real interviewer.' (My a#@).  No wonder Sri Lanka has been failing ever since its existence. The same people who blindly cheered for the barer of "69 lakhs votes" in 2019, praising their ‘mastermind,’ are now the loudest voices cursing him after witnessing the consequences. Now, a new batch of puppets has emerged, quick to take credit for for the work they haven't done while blaming every failure on the previous government.  Yes, Ranil may have had a role—whether in the Easter attacks, the civil war, or even the Batalanda incident. He has undoubtedly made mistakes, some massive and costly, either knowingly or unknowingly. But at the very least, let the man speak. Every time he started to explain himself clearly, Mehdi Hasan conveniently interrupted and jumped to the next accusation.  මේක තේරුම් ගන්න අපේ උන්ට මොලයක් නෑ. That’s precisely why Sri Lanka continues to fail at the most fundamental level. Until people grasp this, real progress will remain a distant dream.  And to those who now idolize Mehdi Hasan as some journalistic messiah—දැන්වත් හැදියන්.
We never think  about wonder about ur channel, The reason is almost to ban this fake and cancer channel lot of countries  ,i am wondered y ranil why parsitpast 🤣terroist channel world wide still asking why sri lanka why was this happened  🤣🤣🤣🤣 shame of u   Sri lanka is strong country ever no one can beat 👍🤩that is special 😁
17:00 lying
27:17-27:27  Don’t  exhibit your foolishness, man .自分が馬鹿と全世界に見せびらかすなよ. මෝඩකම තිබුනට කමක්නැහැ ඒක විදහා පාන්න එපා.  න🐒ල් ගේ  ඇදගෙන නෑම .
He saying JR  was doing a lot. Yes. Agreed. He is the one staged / organized the riots in 1983. Rani, his nephew was in that team.
Old man after so long in politics,  embarrassed 👀  humiliated. .wishing he was not here
I am in no way a supporter of Pres Wikremasighe and I’m a quite big fan of Mehdi Hassan but this interview was a disaster. What’s the value of having Hassan interrupting his interviewee every other three words. It was more of a scolding than a chance to hear Wickremasighe explain or try to justify his time in office. A more settled approach from Hassan would given the viewers so much more substance.
Can you please invite Nawaz Sharif
Justice for civil war victims! Why is it always the people in the North in Sri Lanka who are regarded as war victims? People in the South lost lives due to suicide bombers, and they deserve justice, too.
When Ranil looks back at his life he will see the service and sacrifice he’s made to Sri Lanka. When Mehdi (the journalist) looks back he’ll see nothing but trying to get an upper hand and saying something witty against people who’s done something with their lives. But Kudos to Ranil for not letting an arrogant journalist control the narrative.
This is one side interview and not by head to head
It’s like watching an episode of Pusswedilla
This is poetic justice. What an incompetent man-child. Zero accountability and integrity, a complete joke and perfect example of governance in our country. Thank you Al Jazeera for exposing these crooks on international platforms. The only journalists they cannot intimidate, harass or silence to be never seen again. We have plenty of amazing journalists, but only handful are brave enough to speak against this institution at the cost of their lives. Democracy in Sri Lanka has always been a facade. Politicians are not public servants, they rule on their agendas and as they see fit and we the citizens are their servants, burdened by exorbitant taxing to maintain economic stability all the while they live in luxuries and line up their pockets. Please bring more spot light on Sri Lankan politicians, we support this effort Al Jazeera!
45.50 awesome 🤩 Ranil Rajapaksha
Can you imagine this man was president of Sri Lanka??? I have no words to say…absolute narcissist
Under real fire for the first time ever.
There is still some idiots here supporting him 😂😂
Useless interviewer..doesn't allow Ranil W to talk...
Wickramasinghe completely speechless, should have inquired on the central bank heist during his regime as prime minister…..
Boom 🔥🔥 well done host
Ranil may have thought the journalist was like a Chamuditha. First time he has met a real journalist. Shame....
They have removd my early comments 😮😮😮😮
At that time, this person was not even a member of the Sri Lankan Parliament. The United National Party (UNP) suffered a crushing defeat in the parliamentary by-election held after Gotabhaya Rajapaksa became President, and they were not able to win a single seat. However, their party got one seat based on the percentage of votes, and in the first instance, another person was in parliament representing that party. Also, in that election, the old man Ranil Wickremesinghe was defeated, and later during the struggle, he got his own party's MP removed and infiltrated parliament. Later, as the struggle intensified, Mahinda Rajapaksa had to resign.  At this point, Rajapaksa strategically elevated this old man to the position of Prime Minister, to protect Mahinda (at that time Ranil said that he was a single man and was not aligned with any party and therefore suitable for the Prime Ministership. ) and then he continued his hunt as Mahinda's hound. Later, he became President with the support of all the corrupt parties and today he is participating in various discussions and bragging. The second thing is that there is no economic reform carried out by him. Some financial frauds are still being investigated.
Ranil just exemplified the SL parliamentary system and that there is no hope for justice for tamils or anyone who is against the politicians
As a tamil it is disgusting to see this war criminal murderer responsible for many civilian death including the Sinhalese youth is walking free
Surely ranila ta suttak revila ethi😂😂
When is the interview with Hamas 😂😂. So you guys ask about Shiri bibas and others?
Joker of Sri Lanka😆
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a person from a high class family and he is educated. He is wealthy from his birth... So lots of Sri Lankan 3rd class people jealous of this classy politician...Thatz it...😊
Ranil is the real game changer....❤
Justice was not served says the political prostitute ranil.... admits tamil genocide
Stupid act to coner ranil. He is talking on behalf of Tamil terrorists. Not letting  to answer the  questions. What a idiot.
No one was arrested for Ranil Rajapaksha’s house burnt issue, he was the one who torched his own house and collected a huge compensation. And protestors did not start destroying anything it was a protest without violence and then who was against protestors began beating up people and people had to retaliate thats the truth. Ranil Rajapaksha is a liar and a supporter of Rajapakshas theft 🤮
Political prostitute ranil says no contest on issues that are life and death
කොටි පැටවු වටකරන් පහර දෙන කොට සිංහයෙක් වගෙ කතා කරපු රනිල්ට මගේ ප්‍රණාමය
😌
This man is murderer, Robber, Big white colour thief.
16:58 "No charge against him"  He go around and say he is a lawyer, but he forgot about Article 35 in the constitution of Srilanka. No one can file a csse against or investigate any existing cases against a sitting president.
Real முதல்வன் Frame 🔥  ரணில் as ரகுவரன்  Mehidi As அர்ஜுன் ராஜபக்ச and Co as ஷங்கர்
Ha Ha Ha this is Ranil walking into Lion's mouth.  Crimes done with impunity are laid bare in public. What a humiliation to the biggest loser.
He admits tamil genocide,  atrocities towards tamil ppl were committed in sl
I dont think this debating. Because mrs. Interviers not follow the debate rules. He should give him time to finished for his point and answer. Here we saw only intervier qustion only.
I'm gonna make memes from wickramasinghe 😂  can can can can can  Can i can i can i cani cani  I i i i i i i i i 😂😂😂😂😂
Interviews like this expose this politicians how they abuse the system for personal benefits
Thank you Al Jazeera
This interview is a full exposure of the situation in the country and the plight of tamil people under which ever government may be in  power. AKD or his representative will face the same questions in the international arena in the future.This interview is a total disgrace to all Srilankans and Srilankans must not carry on hiding their heads under the sand and they must wake up and find justice for tamil people who an another nation in the country.
We were waiting for this video to be released ❤😂🎉
You can see how unnatural and threatened they feel when they meet a real journalist instead of the typical, locally trained, biased puppets of these corrupt politicians
Who is this idiot that's hosting this interview. He is so biased and not even letting the guest to finish speaking. He just wants to justify whatever he says and not really interested in finding out the truth. What a badly conducted interview. Very disappointing
Why Once JD Vance says a Dummy to this journalist?? Clearly Ranil scored nice marks against LTTE Tamil diaspora who still trying to build their dream land here in Sri Lanka. Respect Ranil.❤❤
Ex president was a hypocrite I believe most of agree on that. But with regards Tamil people matter I believe they should be more impartial here because it was a war happen people got killed and civilians were armed by LTTE.  Also it should not be forgotten that Sinhalese and Muslim communities were raped murdred including unborn children’s by LTTE for their ideology of separation and killed many innocent civilians even in Colombo. Just because they don’t come behind media propaganda and request justice they cannot be forgotten. Does this people who stand by tamil Eelam acknowledge them. We were war victims as most of these tamils in north. , 1/3 of Colombo population is tamil do they have problems with Sinhalese , stop making fool this international community by referring similarities of Gaza and Sri Lanka.  I hate to say this but , if Gaza was Sri Lanka then our north province would be Israel to be honest. Rather going with hatred roots let’s now make peace among Sinhalese & Tamil’s communities and go forward as united Sri Lanka ❤.
Mehdi, you are talking to war criminal
This needs to be broadcasted all over Sri Lanka, possibly translated to our two national languages. My god, it's incredible. No punches were pulled.
R w is a real murderer in 88/89 . killed many young in Batalanda.
Ranil is a mediocre crony capitalist politician. He is neither smart nor has he shown any leadership in his political career. You can clearly see it if you ask what he has done for the country and his party in his long career.  I'm a Sri Lankan. Sri Lankans are one of the nations with the least political literacy. They have voted convicted murderers, drug dealers, and robbers into parliament.  However, I would give Ranil credit for leading the country out of bankruptcy. He sacrificed his career to implement austerity measures. But he is still quite responsible for the bankruptcy, along with all the other political leaders and religious institutions in the country.
This programme was funded by tamil diaspora😂
genius our ex President Mr.Ranil wickramasingha 🇱🇰
Yes call Basil Ragepaksa and  Namil Rajapaksa
Corrupt Government  all leaders are against the people . Hiding for money no respect for him what so ever
He also the person who destroy our mother nation , and his still greedy basted who wants to see country got failed 🤢🤢🤢
ට්‍රත් විත් චමුදිත ප්‍රෝග්‍රෑම් එක කියලා හිතාගෙන යන්න ඇති.
Horrible former PM and Horrible Media. Let’s talk about violations British did in the history. When people say British the terrorist word always behind that. Also LTTE. They are always terrorists. Such a fancy combination of Terrorists, Horrible former president and unprofessional British media and clown Audience.
That unforgettable life time of crisis we Sri Lankan faced..   Entirely the side effects of corrupted politicians
தலைவரே மாட்டிகிட்ட தலைவரே 😂😂😂
I thought Zelensky was a joker, but he became a serious president. However, Ranil was a president and has now become a joker. 😂
19:43  Ranil started the tricks to escape 😂😂😂
18:9 is hilarious 😂😂😂 Mehdi on 🔥
nail on the head Aljasira
කමිටු සියා යස වැඩේ කොහෙන් හරි කාගෙන් හරි මට්ටු වෙන්න ඕන එකෙක් Respect Al Jazeera
Bro this is the guy who did it u interested a guy who broke the country lol lol
There is no cunning person in Sri Lanka like him. He protected his close friends (people who looted public funds). He is a cunning person like him. He did not give correct answers to the questions he asked, he misled. Nature is the answer to everything. Thank you very much al jazsera journalists ❤
The big fan of Mehdi Hassan from all the way from Sri Lanka
Appreciate the Interview 📈
Al jazeera = Ltte terrorist

Thanks to my guy mehdi hassan for asking clean and clear questions like this.He is the sri lanka's most wanted criminal. He made the issues in sri lanka you can see .he went to law college he knows the law and as you speek with him he is always trying speek non sense stuff always. Respect to mehdi hassan from al jazeera. My final request as a citizen of sri lanka can you ask questions like these from rajapaksha and gotabaya and also from namal rajapksha. If you want to see the batalanda incident from the court search for batalanda ranil wickramasinghe thanks. 👍
This man act like chamuditha😅
Truth is mehdi got owned today...the guest got off even better placed
Ranil is our greatest president who protected our country in the hardest duration
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾😂
I think Grandpa went to this hoping he can boom himself😂
I really want to thank this amazing journalist on behalf of all Sri lankans . I'm sure all the victims and the natives will praise this guy for helping us to heal
A gentleman here, stand up," said Mehdi Hasan, asking Ranil Wickremesinghe to take a question from Callum Macrae. Did he not know who Macrae was? Or did he deliberately choose to avoid introducing him? Do any of you remember Callum Macrae?
Another long-standing insult directed at Ranil was made very clear by the Al Jazeera story.  Back then, the JVP helped make Chandrika the President against Ranil, while Mahinda became President by spreading the notion that Ranil was supporting the Tigers in the North.  But now, the very same Tigers are buying Al Jazeera and questioning Ranil on why he didn’t divide the North back then. thanks aljazeera
Don't bring a clown like this. He is the same like any other old grandpa. This is the man destroyed the country, economy, and system. This clown knows only how to lie.
I don't think Mehdi is a clever sort of journist and making any constructive critism. He is just yelling and trying to twist meanings. Anyone can do that because Mehdi lives in one country and Ranil is from a different country. Would he question his king or royal family who rule his country? Next day his head will be cut off. So it is not possible for Sri Lankan journalists to mess with Sri Lankan politicians.   Ranil did try to stop the war and It is LTTE who refused peace negociations. He is a president and just a simple man. He is not a god to control everyything. Can the USA president stop the killings in cities like Baltimore? What about American Civil war in the past? The terrorist attack was unexepected and how do you think a president could prevented it? Sri Lanka doesn't work under Pope to let the christian leaders tell the government what to do or who to appoint. Only in SL the idiots blame president for everything but its all the work of opposition. Is Ranil a good man or good politician? No. I don't think so but he is only responcible for making bad decision which affected the economy. During war many died and some bodies became unable to identify, some escaped in boats to different places. Should we repopen the cases of violent againt black people in USA? Some problems should be dealth silently. We already know that those people who missing are dead unless they fled.
Stitches incoming at 19:14 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Respected you done well 🙏🙏 ranil shameless savage.he wipeed  our future..
Salute to Sir Mehdi. Keep up the good work 🎉
Batalanda Commission Report is real. It’s his official resident
Dude ur name is Mehedi hasan 😂😂
I would like to say this man big liar in srilanka.also very cunning man.
19:14 he tried to be the joker like he does with Sri Lankan journalists every time and failed with this Journalist 😂 Hats off to the Journalist ❤  “Seeyaa” is exposed to international finally 😅
Hats off 🤜, most awaited moment from young generation , thank you
Respect ranil wickramasinghe ❤  ltt* sons of b@$# never beat srilanka again
Meanwhile Sri-Lankan media doing all the possibilities on not telecasting this on any social media.
No one can beat RW is lord 😇😇😇❤❤❤❤
මානවම්ම රජු ගැන ඇහුවනම් කියයි.....😂😂😂
how could be some1 sooo childish... his facial expressions and body lang tells the truth while his mouth shattering
Ranil is sequirty gurad rajapaksha's
Ranil is corrupted man in blood
Real hero Sri lankan politics President Ranil wickremesinghe ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you 🙏 Mehdi
Good job Aljazeera💓✨️ these oldest useless politicians destroyed our country😢 as young generation, we respect you aljazeera for this kind of program to show the truth for world.
This is a very biased interview. I'm not a Ranil supporter, but he was not given any time to explain his answers. In fact, the interviewer literally seemed UNINTERESTED in even hearing his answers. What kind of interview is that??
Ranil Lke Joker..
In sri lanka he used to tell a joke and go away from the questions😮‍💨
This is incredibly satisfied.
If you questioned someone, let them finised his argument, but these Journalist do not want to answer, just he need to accusation, These kind of interview not appreciatable.
this arrogant interviewer doesn't a;;ow to answer.Keeps on asking questions.We have one in Srilanka named Chamuditha.Some questions should have been asked from those who have been holding office at that particular period.
It is quite clear this is a setup to attack the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Thank you Mr Wickramasinghe, for standing your ground and not bending down on all fours in front of these hired journalists, like another international political puppet like Zelenskyy or AKD.
An armed separatist group called the Tamil Tigers? Does Al Jazeera lack the courage to call the LTTE what it truly was—a terrorist organization? (No mentioning of LTTE a terrorist organization says it all).  A panel of experts or a carefully curated group of Tamil extremist sympathizers? The so-called experts seem anything but impartial.  And the audience? A room full of grinning Tamil diaspora members from the UK, eagerly nodding along.  Amnesty International? Discredited in our part of the world—well said.  Our former president never danced to Mehdi Hasan’s pathetic, agenda-driven tunes. And speaking of Mehdi, just how low can his questions go? "Do you normally attend the birthdays of people you claim to oppose?" What an embarrassing display of journalistic incompetence.  This entire interview reeks of manipulation—clearly edited to favour Al Jazeera’s biased narrative, with jumbled questions and answers designed to mislead.
Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe did answer all questions in  more straight forward manner he was really a good speaker no one from Parliament now days in Sri Lanka will able to do that  Respect to you Sir for answering all unfair questions which tried to make you guilt we love you ever and forever ❤❤
Thank you
This joker Ranil came back to our country and accused the panel to be LTTE supporters 😂😂😂
The thief is getting ripped off..💪
Hey everyone, let’s all agree to say Ranil is a great leader suitable to do politics in srilanka just because he can respond nonsense in English! 😂😂😂😂
I think he  first time meet the professional Jurnalist, Not like Srilanka sewage  What a professionals you are ❤ Al Jazeera
Our politician have the experiance in fighting in the parliment.
Fox in the lion's cave . First time Mr.ranil met a great and real journalist.
Why is he like MR BEAN
Good work journalist ❤
From Nethanyahu to Wickramasinghe AL Jazeera rocking the party. Thanks for speaking the truth over the years and Justice will be served to all human being ❤
Respect Al Jazeera 💪
So true,"that's a part of the problem"🤣 good job al jazeera.
This is the Sri Lankan biggest political lier.
Great program. Al Jazeera ❤️
Ranil always for country respect ❤
Aljazeera needs to be bit mannered when speaking to an president from another country given circumstances, will the anchor call his king of Qatar by his name or the the king of England by his name? I bet - he will not.. what ever said and done he’s a Srilankan and will not tolerate some media maniac who calls him self a journalist to keep disrespectful on a fellow srilanka. At any cost this anchor will definitely gonna help Al Jazeera loose more viewers and move to some other sources. That’s for sure and it’s obvious that our journalists from lk shloud also learn from this anchor to question any personal with this type of sharp questions 🫡
There are strong evidence for his crimes killing, bribery, corruption. He was bailed out by former present CBK form famous trial in Sri Lankan courts
😂😂😂 ohh ranil
Sri Lankan people's best wishes to Al Jazeera, Great work
What a c l o w n 😂😂😂
Who does appoint AG of Sri Lanka?
Srilanka 💙✝️🦾
Im a Sri Lankan he’s a criminal those people stole from us. He must be in jail.
Journalist ❤
Kudos to Al Jazeera. He is the con-artist who ruled the country most the time. He slaughtered the young generation back 80`s but still manged to escape from it. Karma is inevitable.
This guy doesnt want him to express himself! He is not a good interviwer!
At moments it's seems Ranil and Mehdi are doing a comedy skit: 35:22  Ranil ''where is the report"    Mehdi: "It's called the batalanda commission report"  Ranil ''where is the report?! - read from the report..."    Mehdi: "sorry?? I just read.. from the ... report....." - translation - "wtf... are you high?"  Mehdi: Proceeds to read from the report -- Ranil: youyouy youuuu youy yoiuyoyouoyouyoyoyououyo    WTF HAHAHAHAHAHA
Worse politician in Sri Lanka . We call him ponil
Thank you Mr.Rani wikramasinhe.I am proud of you as Sri Lankan❤
He is a war criminal. He set fire to the Tamil library. He is always working with the Western world, which is why he can stay in political power for a long time.
lets go head to head with rajapaksha family next show
As always Mahdi is not letting guest to explain his full answer.
Tamils whon living in England who use this political protection because,  otherwise they cant stay at UK. So they always marketing this ethnic issues  to stay at UK.poor people who sell their own nation to cover there back.
Please Rip ranil
Ranil is f$5ed up old guy , such a joke
Never seen such arrogant unprofessional presenter like this  It’s very clear that he came with a certain agenda and wants to put Mr Wickremasinghe in a bad position  He wouldn’t let Mr Wickremasinghe answer questions  He is just shouting over him  What disgraceful media ?  Shame on Al Jazeera 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Ranil should have being more specific with his defence that he really has to . This buddy is responsible for entire political, ethical and social disasters in sri lanka . He is responsible for populating each race isolated areas in  80s instead of populating in mix races which leaded all the problems in sri Lankan.  If he would have done that by this time we don't see racist territories and no civil war or no Easter attack .
Thank for so much for the interview for talking on behalf of Sri Lanka ♥️
Hats off Al jazeera,for revealing the real culprits in srilnka
Mr. Ranil handled the situation like a pro! He kept his cool while the Tamil Eelam supporters and journalists teamed up against him, trying to back him into a corner. But he didn’t miss a beat!❤🎉
Sri-lanka there was no Civil War. It was created by terrorist group. It's war against  terrorism.  Like war against Al quadea. These foreign media try to make different impressions to our country. We Sri Lankan are very reasonable nation. Hope you all saw what happened to the Ukrainian president who licked EU shoes.
The way he answer the questions it's funny I can read Mr been comedy movie 😂😂😂what kind of attitude he is showed in the stage 😂😂😂
Ranil wickramesinge has been Abused (abused abused)🤣
The only good thing that came out of Mehdi is this interview.
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️ great leader is he Mr. Ranil Wickramasinfhe.. we love our leaders MR and GR too.. hope that world work for their own peace programs, not only our countries need advice on human rights but everyone..  may the triple gems bless my country!! Rest of the world too
Prasident ranil 😂😂😂he don't how yo respect people and how to answer the questions many things he don't know he cannot answer the questions 😂😂its very shame on sri Lankans😂
Mehdi or the other lady doesnt have a clue about what they are talking about the civil war. Thats where this becomes another typical western interview. But all the other arguments were to the point and Ranil was like a headless chicken in aswering those.
this was not an interview, it was an interrogation!
Thanks Al Jazeera.❤
As a Sri Lankan, I am astonished to see our so-called political leaders being questioned in a public forum like this. Well done, Al Jazeera, for this interview! We urge you to bring other political figures, such as the Rajapaksas, to face genuine questions from the people affected by their actions. Salute to the City University professor and the survivors of the Mullivaikal massacre & black July. I also noticed that the gentleman with the ponting beard seemed to be paid to debate but failed when confronted by real people.
Dont trust BBC and aljazeera . Both are terrorists supporting organizations.
Can you keep him in UK please
When we going through this. Be honest who won the debate, truly Ranil tackled very cunningly , further who else will face such a interview like this one except for Ranil. AKD would not understand even a word.
Maduta rasahutti or someone is a close ally of Anton Balasingham who was the political wing leader of LTTE. So we can understand the neutarlity of this interview amd who organizef this. That lady is an open LTTE activist who promotes terrorism by justifying the acts of LTTE.
Wikramasinhe is killer
Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe is not a bad person—on the contrary, he stands out as one of the better figures amidst a crowd of corrupt actors within a racist system that wields ethno-nationalism as a political weapon to systematically oppress minority communities. While his involvement in suppressing the JVP insurrection in the late 1980s remains unclear to me, I view him as progressive, accommodating, and measured in his approach. Tamil militancy emerged as a response to the gradual encroachment on Tamil lands and rights by successive Sinhalese governments. However, the LTTE was far from innocent—they were violent, deeply distrustful of political processes, and oppressive in their own right. The pervasive culture of hatred, violence, and impunity must end. Time offers the best hope for change, and I remain optimistic about a future generation of leaders who can avoid these pitfalls. I hope young people will engage in the political process and dismantle the outdated framework of race-based politics. Greater days lie ahead for this beautiful island, but only if the lessons of the past are truly heeded.
Professional journalism. Hasan, I love the way you call him Ranil Wickramasingha.😂
This interview is proof of a bravery 🙇
This tamil woman should know this is srilanka not India
Rajapaksha who destroyed my mother land Sri Lanka
Ranil was thinking he is addressing the parliament of Sri Lanka. But sadly that is no the case, where he can tell the opposition to "shut up.
Dont trust any of theses journalists specially Aljazeera , BBC, etc all are one sided and trying put srilankans in big trouble . This is what they do as per their agendas against buddist and sinhalese. Two many terrorists siportwrs against one sinhalese man. This is what we can see here.
All these Politicians are Friends and Securing each other, because everyone’s hand is dirty!
Well planned horrible interview organized by LTTE terrorists' diaspora, which had bribed Al jazeera.
What a bluff! In over half a century in politics, he has never given an honest answer. He spoke about the 1983 riots, which were not just communal clashes but a massacre of Tamils by the mass Sinhalese population—just like in 1956. This led young Tamils to take up arms, yet not a single Sinhalese has been punished for these crimes, including the final massacre of Tamils in 2009. Merciless killing of their own country's people, treating them as their enemies.  Since independence, Tamils have been killed without justice. Every government has pretended to seek out the culprits, deliberately stalling to buy time. Even today, systematic efforts continue to dilute the Tamil population—illegally constructing Buddhist temples on private Tamil lands in Tamil areas and settling Sinhalese in Tamil areas. After becoming President, he promised a lasting solution to the Tamil issue before Independence Day(the first one soon after he became President)  but conveniently ignored his pledge. Wickramasinghe, long nicknamed "The Fox," has once again proven why he deserves that name.
Those asking if journalists in Sri Lanka question politicians like this. Did you guys grow up in Sri Lanka in the 80s, 90s and 2000s? Do you remember how journalists, even the common people for that matter were taken out for speaking the truth or confronting politicians or confronting the narrative the politicians were trying  to paint? Do you remember white vans? I can still viscerally feel the unsafety of growing up in Sri Lanka.
Next time, interview Crown Prince Salman of Saudi Arabia, Benjamin Nethamyahu of  Israel, zelenski of Ukrain. Hope this man has balls to interview them!
This is the media network of terrorists and extremists. Mighty al jazeera who promote terrorism amd ask for justice for civillians.
Ranil Vikram Singh is Sri Lanka's dead forest
Anil Vikram Singh is the dead forest of Sri Lanka
This interview should be included in history textbooks
ரணில் இலங்கையின் சவக்கேடு
BBC talking about holding people accountable for Gross violation of human rights?  Then should we go back in history to British colonialism and hold them accountable for the atrocities they committed in Asian countries.
I hope the current president will participate after he failed our country and ruined
We need sinhala and tamil translate.
My hero,  he is the one who saved our country from mobsters and mafia gangsters. Kept everyone together.  Offered road map to current government. Anura  follows Ranil . Salute Mr. President. You are peoples leader. This journalist who showoff and always disturbed,  he looks like joker infront of president Ranil. This foreigner thinking Sri Lankan are idiots. Ranil taught him good lesson. Let's bring him again as president.
Ranil thought that this interview would take him to the top of fame.but hahhahahahhaja
Thanks Aljazeera ❤🙌 bravo
Mehedi Hazan very sorry for you and you fail
Al Jazeera 🫡
Most disgusting character I have ever seen
Your nick name is Ranil Rajapaksha hahahahaaaaa eeka maru Dan sapada?????😂😂😂😂
First I need to thank Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe for accepting this interview. We can realize who is behind this script as usual. As a Sri Lankan, the former president Mr.Ranil Wickramasinghe is a hero for us. Anyone can say anything as per their cunning scripts. But, we know how our country was before and after two years. This cunning presenter doesn't give a chance to speak. He needs to get the answers as per their script. What a buddy fool he is. We regret your script man. Further, india you can question about the war that started with Pakistan. You can question the Ukraine war also. Why only for us? Because we finished LTTE???
As expat and seen civil war 1st hand from Northern sri lanka we knew how corrupted political personalities/ parties divide people using race/ religion and discrimination based on your language than on merit..Since independence this is started and got worsen since JR Jarwardene ( Ranil uncle) who spilt the people and raised ethnic civil war. The interview is bit aggressive but on purpose to pressure Ranil to answer and he falter apart when asked about Mulivaikal genocides & disappearance of people.. Sure no more SL ex presidents/ Priminister will give interviews to Al-Jazeera 😂
Thank you AL jazeera, you did a great job 👏
Thank you RANIL make my country proud
මේක බලද්දි මට හිතුන එකම දේ "අනේ අල් ජසීරා කාරයෝ කොච්චරනම් ආදරේද ලංකාවට" 😂
Hey Al Jazeera what do you know about Easter attack . Just shut your  mouth and stay away from SL politics   You worry about your country!!!   Overview:  ISIS-inspired terrorists conducted a series of suicide attacks against churches and hotels across Sri Lanka on Easter Day, resulting in hundreds of casualties.  Then ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi publicly praised the attacks, illustrating that ISIS remains determined, following its defeat in Syria and Iraq, to continue the fight from its global branches and networks and by inspiring attacks.  The attacks led to isolated outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence, which the government made efforts to stop, though some observers deemed these efforts insufficient.   CIA
Glad SriLanka is at least in this state with this joker / theif / whatever u call it being prime minister 6 times. They tease people using media and come to power💔. Now with the uprising of social media it has stopped
Devil wear suits.!
Hasan was not ready to listen to his BS, which Ranil is good at. Crack a joke on serious questions and slide.  Hats off Hasan! Behalf of Sri Lankans 🫡
The most ironic thing is Ranil spent money to come to Queen's funeral, and had money to celebrate the independence from Britain😂😂😂 and didn't have money for election.😂😂 Probably he visited queen's funeral to secure the independence 😂😂😂   Btw, Ranil is a relative of Rajapaksa family. Mahinda's wife is a Wickramasinghe. That's why Ranil supported Rajapaksas and their thieves after people chased Gota away. That's why the parliament (back then) elected him as the president.😉  P.S. Ranil is a Christian and only partially Buddhist and he uses both religions to escape things. Don't use religions to escape your sins.😠😠😠
He is one the causes fid the corruption in Srilanka, this fellow was safe guarding the thugs like Rajapakshe  gang.  This guy should be chased from the Srilanka.
Each and every fact that was brought up here is showing that how pathetic politician he was
Take away those pieces of paper Mehdi is holding, and he’s completely clueless. Without them, he’d have nothing to say and would probably just let the interviewee take over!
Reminder 🚨 On July 9, 2022, Sirasa TV journalists, including women, were attacked by the police in front of Ranil Wickremesinghe's private residence near Thurstan College while they were broadcasting live on television.
76.  YEARS.   RULE.  U N P.  S L.P.P.   S.L.N.P.   S.J.P.   ALL ROPER  &.   THIFS POLITICIANS.   DESTROYED.   SRILANKA.   (BANKRUPT.)
Ranil did not get chance to speak.interviewer always disturbing when they did not getting the answer that they want.this is tragedy.disgusting journalism by al Jazeera.
Nobody broke but the muslum brotherhood supporters!!
Well known cunning fox Ranil finally caught in lies , lol  Thanks Mehdi
The interviewer and the other white lady can’t talk, what about how UK completely robbed Srilanka and other countries during the colonisation???
Ranil isnt a saint in fact closer to the devil himself but Al Jazeera is far from being a saint aswell. So at the end its the people who have died and suffered that remains lost and forever shall remain lost.
Thank you Al-Jazeera. Finally,  you brought a hidden fox to the light.
I would like to see our president in this debate, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayake
@allJazeera respect 🫡.. this is the Journalism we need in Sri Lanka! 🙌
Journalist must have modesty but this one havent little bit of it. He was trying to get the answer which he want. But really is different . Thank you mr RW for safe the name and independence of the Sri Lanka . Al Jazera, please train your journalist with modest and basics of journalism .
Grate leader in sri lanka ranil wikramasinha
He is 💯 responsible for killing innocent ppl and is part of all the conspiracies. One big lier murderer central bank robber. Rajapakse sympathetic moron
go to Tamil nadu that is your mother country why Sri lanka
How much happiness did you receive from the Tamil diaspora for this, Mr. Hassan?
This program should be reported for promoting terrorism. It blatantly avoids the war crimes done by the LTTE and also the part tbe tamil diaspora played by funding tbat banned terrorist organization.  This is a paid media campaign to paint a bad image on sri lanka as a state and to justify tbe inhuman acts done by LTTE.  The same people who sat in this program are accountable for war crimes too for funding a terrorist organization.  LTTE recruited children as soldiers and killed whoever who tried to flee from.theie clutches or cut their legs. Tbey formed suicide cadres. Now tamil people live in peace. They dont need a war again. But these diaspora people who promote LTTE must be prosecuted immediately alonh with this goon call mehedi
Thankfully Ranil met right Journalist, thank Mr. Journalist and delivered the message to rest of the world. Ranil, shame you of you. Once again thanks for organisers 👏👏👏
@5:16 he said, he got elected by the parliament...... did you remember we the people of sri lanka, took down and banned the president as well as the parliament THE WHOLE PARLIMENT!!!..... he just survived that transition cunningly hiding behind the clauses of the constitution
This is proper head on journalism. All what you see here in Sri Lanka are gullible journalists who simply swallow whatever they are told by these crooked politicians. No cross questions, no hard talk; just stay mum and listen to whatever is told. It is so refreshing to see RW being cornered.
Sri lankans dont talk high abt this interview in the second part of the program they are blaming war crimes on us trying to imply that we did war crimes. And innocent LTTE lost heavily
Mad respect to the journalist for exposing our corrupt master mind Ranil. He's been getting away with his evasion techniques for so long..
මුල්ලිවයික්කාල් වල ඇත්තටම මොකද්ද උනේ ?
Great leader mr ranil
Muslim extremists have taken a good bath in Al Jazeera. Muslim extremists have no backbone to expose the terrorism they are spreading in the world. Why can't they say that the Easter attack was carried out by Muslim extremists when the whole world is watching? They have made up a story about the mastermind to force it on the Sinhalese people, but the people of Sri Lanka don't understand that.
since  1958 anti-Tamil pogrom and riots in Ceylon since 1956,1958,1971,1977,1981,1983 and 1981 burning containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts. all Sinhalese respons the killed tamils in (1956 to 2009)in 2009 killd more than 150000
One of the cunning politicians in srilanka 😢he always thinking about his power
I respect you and salute you sir facing these bullsHIT people called TIGERS. THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE MONKEYS AND USED TO DRINK VINES SPRIT INSTEAD of ALCOHOL (aRAKKU BACK HOME)
Ranil gets angry when mehdi says Rajapaksha 😂😂

As a srilankan Nice to hear revealing the truths
fox dreem
this was the cringiest thing I have ever seen in my entire life 😂, kudos to Medhi to giving this man a taste of your jounalism! as a fellow Sri Lankan I can see why me and others in my country can't go and be a figure in this world by looking at the former president's behaviour...
For the first time, Ranil met a real journalist
Hes name Ranil Rajapaksha😂😂
Al Jazeera should have sent an intelligent guy to interview Ranil This guy looks so amateurish. Wish I get a chance to see this guy  interview the head of state of Saudi, sure he'll look like a pup!
Al jazeera's Chamutha.
Post the full 2 hrs video instead of edited 49 mins.
Matikinaaru orutharu awara kapathanum kartharu 😂
shame on you al Jazeera  until I saw this interview with our country's former executive president h.e ranil wickramasinghe sir  I honestly thought and believed  your  media platform is  some what balanced   as well as unbiased  international electronic  media platform but after this interview  now I can clearly see and say that you are certainly not an unbiased  balance  media  unit  its very clear that  you are  definitely well paid  and funded by  anti Sri Lankan and pro ltte diaspora  activists and  NGO'S etc etc.  as a very famous  ( so called) internationally  recognized  media platform  you fellows  must  always  keep and further strengthen your  trustworthiness  and unbiased  journalism  but yesterday I saw a totally opposite  view and  behavior from your  media platform  etc that's very unfortunate incident  and you must definitely learn how to  give proper  respect  international  leaders  or any invitee or  guests  whether you like them or not  please  teach those  media  or journalism  qualities  and ethics to your  presentators  and  journalists  who's  working with your media platform  and as a patriotic and nationalist non political neutral Sri Lankan citizen I must say that Sri Lankan  forces never ever  committed any war crimes against innocent Tamil civilians or against any ethnic  communities  living inside Sri Lankan territory  ok and whether  various local or  foreign individuals or groups  may have various negative or positive thoughts and feelings and views and opinions about the former Sri Lankan executive president h.e mahinda rajapaksha sir and his younger  brother and  the former defense secretary and the former executive president h.e Gotabaya rajapaksha sir   as former head of state's and the former defense secretary they gave their political and administrative  leadership  to defeat the most brutal terrorist organisation of this entire world the non other than the ltte terrorist organization and its leadership  and former army commander and the current field Marshall gen sarath fonseka sir and former  chief navy and the air force commanders  and  the  other tri forces military members and officials and members of the Sri Lankan police department and the STF forces and the civil defense forces  combined  dedicated service just paved the way for Sri Lanka to defeat the most brutal  terrorist organisation of this world  ok thousands of military forces lives were killed along with thousands of civilians  belongs to every Sri Lankan community  were murdered by those brutal ltte terrorists  Sri Lankan forces  never ever committed any kind of war crimes  we just  destroyed  group of suicidal  ideological  terrorist organization  ok Sri Lankan government forces  never ever bombed  any civilian hospitals or shelters  actually  under the guidance and directions of the former Sri Lankan president hon mahinda rajapaksha government  Sri Lankan forces  and  government  servants  provided every necessary  essential items  such as food  items  medicines   water and electricity  and  other  important  basic items to our country's  Tamil brothers and sisters and friends  without any hesitation  actually all of those  facilities were given or provided to them during  fierce fighting and  battles  between  the Sri   Lankan military forces and the ltte terrorist organization   I can't remember  any other nation acted  that type of  behavior or took that  kind of  very  humane approach  even to your enemies  in any type of battle field  that's how our country's  humanitarian  battle or war against the terrorists  conducted  or happened  so you foreigners  or international media platforms  don't have any moral right to question our country's  battle against the brutal ltte terrorist organization   which  was  conducted by  strictly following every international humanitarian laws and regulations  and  al Jazeera must thank every former Sri Lankan government  which  allowed them to  frequently visit to the battle  areas during our  struggle against the terroristm   unlike our Israeli friends past  Sri Lankan governments  specially   the former government of the hon mahinda rajapaksha sir during the war time  never ever  try to banned  al Jazeera  or any other pro ltte  and anti Sri Lankan forces  foreign media platforms  inside Sri Lanka  so you guys actually be very thankful and grateful to our former leaders and administrations 😂😂😂😂  and I must say that though I am a totally non political and neutral person  our former executive president hon ranil wickramasinghe sir faced this  hard  biased interview  in very satisfactory way and manner  and he managed to protect our braved  military forces  reputation and  their  dignity  so hatts off to hon wickramasinghe  sir  and  I must say that  personally  I am also don't like  some foreign media platforms like the al Jazeera  or the BBC or the British channel 4 media platforms  cos of their too much of  anti Sri Lankan stance specially their anti Sri Lankan forces and anti sinhala Buddhist majority   views and opinions and approaches  but hon wickramasinghe sir some what  bravely took that  challenge  and  participated  to that interview but sadly   every sound minded prudent balance  people  were very fortunate to see the real double face of the so called  unbiased al Jazeera media platform 😂😂😂😂😂so we must really thankful to the entire al Jazeera managment and ownership and its journalists  for  either internationally or unintentionally showed the entire world about their  real  crooked  double standard journalistic approach  😂😂😂😂 I can clearly see that why the Israeli government and leadership  took immediate actions against these kind of  very  dangerous  terrorist friendly foreign media platforms   so as an anti terrorist  citizen I really really thanks the current Israeli government  for their bold and courageous  actions against these type of ( such as al Jazeera etc.) terrorist friendly  media platforms  ...
I didn't expect  this from mehdhi hassan .... thanks
This is so cringe...Makes me wanna leave the interview.
All these LTTE Tigers got triggered once again. 😂 Why can't the media stop asking about the Sri Lankan war? Why not discuss the current war situations in the world, like Russia, Palestine, etc.? Our war is over, and there is no more LTTE or Prabhakaran in Sri Lanka. People in Sri Lanka are happy now. There is no racism.    We always unite when our country is in danger. That’s how we sent the entire Rajapaksa family home. I know Ranil is not a great politician and has made mistakes, but I appreciate the way he calmly answered those questions. The journalist seemed to think Ranil would walk out of the interview because he wasn’t given a chance to speak. That was likely his intention—so he could later claim that Ranil left in the middle of the debate.    Asking whether he attended Queen Elizabeth’s funeral or about Rajapaksa’s birthday are such idiotic questions! It’s his decision whether to go or not, and it’s completely irrelevant here.    Learn journalism from Palki Sharma (WION). Journalism isn’t about shouting and trying to prove the other person wrong.
රනිල් ට ආයෙත් බලය ගන්න මේ සාකච්චාව උදවුවක්.
Please invite any Rajapakshe
Shame ranil
What an AH the so called mehdi hasan who does not give  ted to speak as he cannot break him. He is frustrated with himself.
I'm no supporter of Ranil, yet Mehedi is an absolute disgrace!
Please bring Mahinda Rajapaksha next 😂
I cannot imagine if Anura was there instead of Ranil. Ranil is the great leader and great politician ever in Sri Lanka and saved my country in her biggest economic crisis in her history ❤❤❤
A real journalist should uphold professionalism, fairness, and respect in interviews. While pressing for answers and challenging statements is part of good journalism, constantly interrupting the interviewee can come across as unprofessional and biased. Ideally, a journalist should allow the speaker to respond fully before asking follow-ups, ensuring a balanced and meaningful discussion. If the journalist in question repeatedly disrupted the conversation, it raises concerns about their approach and adherence to journalistic standards. This is what I daw with this so called real journalist!  If a journalist consistently interrupts and only allows partial answers to steer the conversation toward their own narrative, it compromises journalistic integrity. A real journalist should aim to uncover the truth, not manipulate responses to fit a predetermined agenda. This approach can distort public perception and misrepresent the speaker’s actual views. Ethical journalism requires allowing the interviewee to fully express their thoughts, even when being challenged. If a journalist selectively controls the conversation to validate their own viewpoint, it leans more toward advocacy or bias rather than objective reporting.
ranil wickremesinghe new chapter wil start 2027 or 2028
Karma got ranil 😂😂😂
Has the author ever tried to research the innocent others who lost lives at the hand of terrorists over 26 years.
It started with the economic crisis, but everything else was tamil diaspora plan. Shame on you AlJazeera. The journalist must have given a lot of money.
What about the Bond Scam
I am from Sri Lanka...Now you can see how poloticians act in the country...I thank AlJazeera to ask those questions from him ..He is a batalanda killer and also they new about easter attack...Now he is trying to slip jist saying nonsense
Is the terrorist representative speaking on behalf of all victims.
Well Done Ranil. Ranil didn't face a journalist, RW faced a set of PRO terrorists, NGO representatives who support LTTE . Ranil has been playing the middle ground as a politician by being impartial and has always maintained a decent role compared to leaders from the US, Britain, or Middle Eastern countries. It is clear that NGOs from different diasporas wanted a puppet in Sri Lanka’s leadership, not a strong leader like Ranil, who is highly versatile in managing a country. Many leading presidents from these countries have done far worse things, yet no one questions them like this. This reflects a very biased audience and poor journalism.
The jounalist is displaying his uncivilised nature clearly in this program. Usually letting the interviewee   to talk enough is a good characteristic of a civilised journalist.
The interviewer is not allowed to answer.
සීයගෙ කලිසම
Guilty ++ , trying to be evasive with absolute failure!  WE SRI LANKANS IN MAJORITY , ABSOLUTELY HATE HIM AS A POLTICIAN AND AS A MAN !!  Despicable man ranil!!!
Hasan or whoever he is  he needs to check his head first. Wants a reply but don't want the reply to be heard 😅
ජංගි ගැලවෙනවා දැකලා තියෙනවා, ඒ වුනාට මේ වගේ ඉරාගෙන යනවා නම් මේ දැක්කම තමයි, සත්තයි ඔව් 😘😘😘
This interviewer is street rowdy
What a rude journalist.
Uncivilized journalist
If you want to know the ugliness of journalism, watch this program carefully and read carefully.  Point 01:  Anton Balasingham's (former terrorist  leader)   Point  02: Anton Balasingham's advisor's wife.
Hello Aljazeera, I agree that RW is a corrupt politician. But you are also corrupt media company, to stand with a terrorist organisation.
A request for Mr. Hasan from one of his many Admirers of his Journalism from India , If you could please invite Mr. Subramanian Swamy who is an Economist and Former Minister of Law and Justice to your show Head to Head , He is a very interesting Figure whom you should really look into !
Aggressive questioning , is not in  decent way ,  So Mr ranil responses correctly.
Ranil is a curse for Sri Lanka, Ranil has never been able to win by asking for an election, because people hate this murderous crook so much.  Ranil should be held directly accountable for the murders committed during 88/89. Ranil ran the battalion torture chambers.  Ranil is a thief who has really destroyed the country because of political protection and did not go out much in the Batalanda case.  Ranil is a very low-level thief who stole 10 billion rupees from the Central Bank of our country and a very low-level cunning murderer.  The wish of all of us is that one day we should live and die.

Thanks al jazeera journalist reveals this fox
Please interview someone from the Rajapaksa family. This is something we could watch for hours, if not days. What a relief to see these politicians speechless.
Ranil shat his stupid pants today. Thank you Aljazeera for exposing this criminal. He is an actul criminal
An arrogent idiot= Ranil Wickramasinghe
Is this funded my diaspora??
Only the money of tamil diaspora talks here. Nothing else
මේක බලලා රනිල් ට හිනා වෙන සක්කිලින්ට කියන්න තියෙන්නේ රනිල් එක වචනයකින් වත් රට පාවා දුන්නද?
Thank you for aljazeera... im from sri lanka... cant ask like that questions in sri lankan journalist... this team(rajapaksha and ranil) he killed of disappeared that journalist talk against to them... now my contry control very honest peoples... thank you again ask questions  like this....
Attending queens funeral is a crime according to the mad journalist 😂😂😂😂
Yo Aljazeera did a solid job here. This man is an actul criminal. He's got blood in his hand from a long time ago
This is not an international interview ... this is like a bunch of wolfs trying to hunt a rabbit 😅
Audience එකේ දැක්කම පේනෙ ඔක්කොම ප්‍රභාගෙ පැටව් වගේනෙ, මුන් පැරදිලාත් ලැජ්ජ නෑ
Kudos to the journalist... My heart is happy..
Agree alll the things except Civil war questions.
The journalist's behavior during the interview is shockingly unprofessional, consistently interrupting and not allowing the interviewer a chance to speak. This exchange feels less like a genuine dialogue and more like an orchestrated effort to sow discord regarding the unity of Sri Lanka. Today, the vast majority of Sri Lankans—regardless of whether they identify as Sinhalese or Tamils—yearn to live together as proud Sri Lankans, united in purpose and spirit. Unfortunately, there are politicians and NGO groups that thrive on discord and dissent, treating the country’s challenges as opportunities for personal gain. A prime example can be seen in the actions of two ladies who claim to care deeply for Sri Lanka, yet seem to embody an agenda that runs counter to our collective values.   It’s important to remember the commendable efforts of the Sri Lankan army, which fought valiantly against terrorism, often employing the most humane strategies in incredibly challenging circumstances, even as the terrorist group used civilians as shields. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that all Sri Lankans stand united against external forces that seek to divide you. Together, can forge a brighter, more harmonious future for your beloved nation!
journalist behavior is not accepted.. roudy type... like a murderer .😂
ගාසාවල ජනසංහාරය කරන උන්... ඉරාකයේ, ලිබියාවෙ, සිරියාවෙ  ජනසංහාරය කරන උන්... අසාධාරණව කොටු කර ප්‍රශ්න ඇසීම...... ලංකාවෙ එදාවගේම  අදත් පාවාදෙන "විභීෂණ​" පුත්තු, නැදෑයො පාවාදුන්නු "කුවේණිලා"ගේ පුත්තු  ......comments වල අරක් ගත්තු..
If former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had not snatched the government from Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2004, the country called Sri Lanka would never have fallen to this point.

Respect Al Jazeera! Pls bring one of Rajapaksha’s next time! 😃❤️
They spoke as if only Tamils were the victims of war. It's a fact that how the ltte used their own tamil civillians as a shield and how they were saved by our armies and how those pepole themself praised for what they did. So it's a wide topic to speak. Both of the sides faced the losses equally. But no more less we all are human after all. Presently all live together and their is no ingle problem or disregard to tamils here. Idk why these tamil fellows still build up stories talking about situations.  After all its the land of the Sinhalese where other nations "were welcomed " and all lived together in harmony....
Tamil diaspora along with al jazeera and that half bred mehedi or someone is trying to bring back that reign of terror by LTTE again in the north. Every person who is a part of tamil diaspora must be taken accountable for war crimes done by LTTE since they funded LTTE  to continue all their attrocities and to maintain their refugee status. If they love this country so much why dont they come back to sri lanka. Please all those states who provide refugee status for tamils please send them back here. They love this country so much. Let them feel it.
ජාත්යන්තරව පච උන රනිල්.
Ranil... you are a legend . At the Age of 75 you still running strong .. ❤ Mehedi.. go and get a life 😂
The LTTE were murderers and used civilians as human bombs and human shields, which was why the casualties were so high. When questioned about war crimes in Iraq, George Bush said it was collateral damage, are there different rules for the west and the rest?
That one journalist did his homework right. Thank you sir...
O Worried about the victims, but what have they done to the victims? The other thing is that all these things happen only for money
Next time Namal Rajapaksha
It is true that the Rajapaksas are corrupt, but taking action against them is absolutely unacceptable as they were given leadership in destroying the LTTE terrorist organization. It should also be remembered that this game played by groups supporting defeated terrorist organizations using the media is paving the way for the Rajapaksa regime to return to power.
Who is this announcer he is crazy? One side is taken by this announcer who is speaking, don't buy the announcers to make programs. ????🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
You have to have balls of steel to face Mehdi questions.
Ranil Rajapaksa should partly responsible for the bankrupt of the country
Respect for ranil ❤ This program has hidden purpose. Al jazeera 💩
Respect RW❤❤
This old man is an expert in the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the Law. He has not done anything illegal. If anyone doesn't like anything he has done - still it must be totally legal one way or another.
Victims are always victims.  It doesn't make any difference.  It will never change no matter how much we talk about it
While saying that the military has committed crimes, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe himself has confirmed his position that these are isolated incidents/crimes.  That is, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe has rejected the Tamil community's position that the crimes committed by the military and the government are systemic crimes.
Mun yakoo yudde iwara karapu ekata neda sadde daanne..ranila pattakin tiyahankoo. Kotiya kotiyamai yako. Ape kollo kochchara kattak kalada me rata eksesath kare.Tamil human right gaga appata heminenna hadanwa.
Bro is 75 And still took it to the chin...
This shows the sadness that the groups that engaged in terrorist acts and other extremist organizations lost the opportunity to run the country as they wanted in the circumstances that arose.
No other Sri Lankan leader could have answered Mr. Hassan's questions, as knowledgeably as Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe.  If he was given a chance to speak with the respect and professionalism he deserves by Mr. Hassan, Mr RW could have addressed the questions very effectively.    Of course Mr RW cannot undo the wrongs done by the then governments.  But he is probably the most knowledgeable who's served the country throughout all those issues..
Next time Sajith Premadasa. definitely, al jazeera will have to prepare the latest edition of oxford dictionary
What we ultimately realized was that none of the youth or leaders who participated in the struggle had any vision for stabilizing the country or moving it forward. ( From Sri Lanka)
மிக்க நன்றி Al Jazeera English . தமிழர்களுக்கு நடந்த அநியாயங்கள் போர்க்குற்றங்கள் தொடர்பாக சரியான கேள்விகளை சரியான நபரிடம் கேட்டுள்ளீர்கள் . காரணம் யுத்தம் முடிந்த பின்னர் தீர்மானிக்கும் சக்தியாக இரண்டு முறை ரணில் விக்ரமசிங்க இருந்துள்ளார் . ஒன்று நல்லாட்சி அரசு பிரதமர் அடுத்து ஜனாதிபதி . ஆனால் இந்த இரண்டு கட்டங்களிலும் தமிழர்களுக்கு ஏமாற்று நாடகம் ஆடியுள்ளார் .                                      இலங்கையில் போர்க்குற்றம் இடம்பெற்றதையும் வைத்தியசாலைமீது குண்டுத்தாக்குதல் பற்றியும் இறுதி வரை ரணில் ஏற்றுக்கொள்ளவில்லை . அதை கடந்துசெல்வதற்கே முயற்சிக்கிறார் . இந்த நிலையில்தான் இலங்கையில் உள்ள ஒவ்வொரு ஆட்சியாளர்களும் உள்ளார்கள் .   முதல்முறையாக சர்வதேச ஊடகம் ஒன்று பொறுப்புக்கூறவேண்டிய மனிதர் ஒருவரிடம் தமிழர்களின் நீதியின் குரலாக கேள்வியெழுப்பியுள்ளது மகிழ்ச்சி .   நன்றி - Mehdi Hasan , Frances Harriso , Madura Rasaratnam     Thank you very much Al Jazeera English. You have asked the right questions to the right person regarding the injustices and war crimes committed against the Tamils. The reason is that Ranil Wickremesinghe has been the deciding force twice after the war ended. One is a good governance government, the Prime Minister, and the other is a President. But in both these phases, he has played a trick on the Tamils.  Ranil did not accept the war crimes committed in Sri Lanka and the bombing of the hospital until the end. He is trying to ignore it. This is the situation of every ruler in Sri Lanka.   It is a pleasure that for the first time an international media outlet has questioned an accountable individual as the voice of justice for the Tamil people.   Thanks - Mehdi Hasan, Frances Harriso, Madura Rasaratnam
This is the hypocricy of Sri Lankan politics. Ranil is the main destructer of the economy and political system.
Great job Mr. Wickramasinghe Anyone can comment on anything here because most commented here are not people living in SL.  The best thing is not to let any powerful nation intervene our internal affairs. If so ,SL will be soon become another Libiya
Learn how to be cool and respond to various impolite verbal attacks from Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe.
Ranil  Was  A JOKER and he is Joker and He will be Joker. During the financial crisis, he allowed the corrupt governing party to exploit Sri Lankan taxpayers' money further, which is now being exposed in the COPE committee. He said No money for election  but Paid more than 1290 Mil to Parliment members whos properties were damage during Aragalaya.
All leaders of Sri Lanka have no true courage to resolve ethnic issues. They will continue to destroy this beautiful country!
This is seems to be useless & valueless interview.
Ranil wicramasinghe is a mudder he killed thousands of university students in 88/89 that's all us know
Hats off ranil 🙌
EXCELLENT
Al Jazeera The announcers  like a  children of nursery school 😮
If d persons dont know english well what will happen
First and foremost please note I’m not a fan of Ranil W or a fanatic nationalist and someone who deny all what happened during the ethnic conflict and insurrections. However, I thought I should give my views on this interview which is hailed by many as a masterpiece of Mehdi Hassan. Audience seems to be selected to be biased for a certain community to suite the agenda of the program and the interviewer. Panel too seemed biased simply representing the audience. Nobody in the audience asked anything about the economic crisis but only about civil war which is actually terrorism. How many civilians in the border villages were massacred? How many innocent civilians were bombed all over the country. How many were killed while praying in mosques and sacred Buddhist places like Sri Maha Bodhi and the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, commuting in buses and trains etc. Shouldn’t those who funded the terrorists be held responsible for all those horrendous atrocities? Nothing is questioned!  Although a lot of praise is being showered on Mehdi Hassan for his bravery on questioning, he simply didn’t allow RW to finish any of the answers, which is simply pathetic! Is that the great journalism we talked about! I don’t think so! On the comparison of Gaza to Mulliwaikkal and Israel following Sri Lanka is an utter joke in the context of Geo Politics and the power games of the world powers!
Aranthalava killing of buddhist monks , bombing sri dhalada maligava, bombing central bank , killing civilians in colombo & other cities by tamil insurgents. & lot of etcs .why dont u discuss all these. What d hate with rajapaksas & ranils.
This is not a neutral discussion with international media but rather a highly orchestrated ambush—an organized smear campaign.
@sirasatv @Rupawahini @Itn please translate this and telecast
He learnt his lesson finally
Worth uhh varma varthu😂 I've been waiting for my whole life
Respect you Aljazeera As a sri lankan.  You are a good journalist.
Get the Rajapaksa on stage.
Shame .. if any sri lankan in happy with this
Thanks Mehendi
Oh god😂 love this journalist 🎉
Auditoriam seems to be bullying interviewers. Its not nice.
Finally Mr.Ranil Wickramasingha Meets real journalist to point out curreption of sri lankan Politicians 🎉
Now everyone knows Ranil is real idiot.
Why the answers were not addressed for the specific questions? The Supreme level person should have answered. To the point with clear answers
Ranil r.i.p 😅😅😅😅😅
Respect Al  jazeera
Parliament members who appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as the president is not the accurate representation of the general public at that time. Dont you know about that Ranil Wickremesinghe ???? Don't lie internationally as you are in SriLanka😂😂😂😂
රනිලව බිත්තියටම හේත්තු කරා... 😂😂😂😂
Who is this announcer he is crazy ? One side is taken by this announcer who is speaking, don't buy the announcers to make programs.  ????
Pains me to watch this! Honestly! Finally he was asked real questions. And from the answers finally the world sees who he is.
Senior selfish politician 😗 shame for Sri Lanka. Corrupted politicians were created by RW in Sri Lanka  This man couldn't manage his own party, how can he manage the country??!😮Ranil was very excited and panic during this interview, but he was trying to pass his feeling on the interviewer. 😅😊
He Nailed it in the end. Be more respectful, he is ex Head of state.
Al  jezeera respect you fro❤❤❤
Thank you al jazeera , ranil was puppet of rajapaksha  😂
This is how exactly the SL government people answer questions from public, so careless and a stupid joke at the end. This should be changed!
Why nobody questioned why tails bombed the most areas in srilanka, why they attack children. Why they attack inercnt, why they train kids with guns, also why there is still class differences in jafna?
නාකි පිම්පියාට හොද වැඩේ ලයිසන් එක හොරට අරන් තියෙන්නේ ජාත්‍යන්තරය නෑමක් 😂
NUKE HAMAS
GREAT  Politicians formar  president. You  faced  really  challenging  discussions  also  GREAT  success
Dear Mehdi, you have only increased Ranil's blood pressure by asking such questions. It is sad to see Ranil stumbling.ranil one of the puppet president
🙏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾
Mr. Hassan, This is hardly real journalism. You don't even have the decency to let the speaker finish their sentence. No wonder you had to beg Republicans for an interview and JD Vance even called you a 'dummy.' Also, why haven't you published the full video? Is this similar to the CBS situation with Kamala Harris? Come on, please be independent and don't prove President Trump’s accusations that you are just an extension of Arabian propaganda.
How a such Butcher become such clam?
If Anura Kumara there instead of RW this kind of thing never happens. because Anura can't understand or speak English so there should be translator in between Mehedi and Anura .Anura speak in Sinhala and Translator convert to English and when Mehedi asked a question translator convert in to Sinhala 🤣🤣
Sri lankan journalists should take this as a lesson when questioning corruped politicians.
FU&CK YOU ALJAZEERA😂
L
Interviewee should have chance to explain his answer .. why this journalist doesnt have patience .. why he want to make the audience laugh according to their agenda...😢
Free Tamils; free Tamil Elam then talk all the nonsense
Truth will win 🇱🇰
*@chathuraalwis you must see this!* 😖
He wasn't prepared for the interview. Hats off to the journalist.
Mr Mehedi..... how much they paid you for this....😂😂😂
Mehdi Hasan as usual gets verbal diarrhea.
We in Sri Lankan salute Al Jazeera for the truthful platform.
Funny this clown (and all his clan) call themselves buddhist while having catholic name in their awkwardly long nomenclature 😂😂😂
මචන්, මම ඉන්නෙ ඔසී, ඒ හින්ද මේක රියල් ජර්නලිස් කියන්න එපා. මේක රනිල්ව කෝනර් කරන සීන් එකක්, සෑහෙන්න ට්‍රයි කලා උන්ට ඕනෙ උත්තරේ ගන්න, ඒත් බැරි උනා. මගේ මතේ හැටියට. තනිකරම එල්ටීටී ඩයස්පෝරාව මෙතන ඉන්නෙ උබල හුරේ දැම්මට. රනිල් මිනිහට පුලුවන් උපරිමේ කරනව රට වෙනුවෙන්. මෙතනදි 88/89 කැරැලි කරපු කට්ටිය නේද බලේ ඉන්නෙ ඇහුවනම් මිනිහ ඒකටත් ලස්සනට උත්තර දෙනව. රට වෙනුවෙන් කරන කතාවක් මේක. උබ්ල පාට පක්ශ අමතක කරල මේක බලපල්ල. අපේ රටට විරුද්ද සෙට් එකට ඕනෙ කරන ඉත්තෙක් වෙන්න එපා.
I see lot of cheering for the journalist.; I'll cheer the journalist when he questioned the same way from  nethanyahu or George Bush about their roles of Palestine and iraq or Afghanistan
Thank you Mehdi Hasan for bringing this demon to the stage .. out efforts as young generation of Sri lanka with the struggle has succeeded so far .. These these old clowns are the very reason our country was where it was. Again Thank you.❤
Please interview Narendra Modi too :)
Why the lady have questions written, can see already she is on preparation of condom the country of srilanka
Al Jazeera & CNN are Sisters , just like CNN  makes all Americans think  Zionists policies  make America the most powerful country, Al Jazeera is planted to by Zionists as Arab TV station where the Arabs will believe it's broadcasting  authentic Arab news & Al Jazeera made all democratic Arab governments fall.
Is this interview funded by bunch of  goons.....? The journalist is more like a rowdy 😂😂😂

Why don't you focus on the civil war...As the journalist says, the whole world has heard that the Sri Lankan army killed innocent people...Why doesn't anyone talk about the innocent people killed by the Tamil Tigers, including their community? Were only Tamils ​​killed? How many ordinary people were killed by the LTTE? Even though the war was in the north, the LTTE planted bombs all over the country and killed people...They massacred small children, pregnant women, and villagers...But what the army did was to give even the people who escaped the LTTE a chance to eat. Why doesn't anyone talk about that truth here...Sixteen years after the war ended, as a country and a nation, we have not been able to tell the world a true story about the war...They still only accept what the LTTE-friendly journalists said. They don't talk about the suffering that the country as a whole suffered,  They make documentaries about the miserable conditions in the LTTE camps and talk about the war... There are still people suffering because of the war all over the country... They only talk about the missing LTTE members. They are terrorists... They took up arms to kill unarmed civilians and small children to win over their leader. If they say they sought peace through that, it is a big joke... There is no point in talking about Ranil... Because we have always known whether the things they say about their politics are true or not... But we must stop giving the world a wrong idea about the war... If this continues like this, in about ten years, other communities in this country will be the culprits and our future generations will say that the LTTE was right. I watched the entire program... The Sri Lankan army is only accused of war crimes internationally. During the war, we saw the army as God... Those people risked their lives to protect Sri Lanka... All four nations can live freely... Even today  I always respect those great people for that.  The entire program shows the LTTE as innocent... that the army and others killed them for nothing... No one mentions the massacres that the LTTE committed by killing all the inhabitants of the villages, even small children.
Is this a comedy show ?
Buddhism was reintroduced by the British to the so called Sinhalese who descended predominantly from Portuguese. This guy quoting evangelical buddhist stories is utter nonsense 😂😂😂
Sri lankans here don’t understand the fact that Al Jazeera is making LTTE look like the victim and not guilty. This interview was a one sided interview targeted just to make LTTE gain sympathy and look the SL government completely liable. Nice try Al Jazeera
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe, you are excellent. Mehedi Hassan behaved in this discussion in a very low manner.  But Sri Lankans respect you..❤
hey journalist, why Palestine protect the Islamic terrorist group Hamas. you should bring who ever the Palestine leader and ask why they protecting a terrorist group
❤❤❤Sri Lanka❤❤❤
AS A LANKAN  IM VERY MUCH FOND OF THIS INTERVIEW
OH MY GODDD HE IS SUCH A JOURNALIST       WOWW WOWWW  RANIL U ARE FINISHED
Mr Mehedi... can u question Mr putin or Trump like this.....😂😂😂 you are going out of head...
The journalist is not ready to listen the interviewee.....😂 see his arrogance .. this is 3rd class cheap media ethics..just like සිරස tv media goons
Very rude and unprofessional interviewer.
Even most people emotionally praised this interview, I think the host keep jumping and interupted the conversation wasted 20 minutes trying to understand and get value from topic. Very poor setup by aljazeera
i feel sorry for Ranil fr lmao
அன்றே சொன்னார் அன்டன் பாலசிங்கம் அவர்கள் இவன் சரியான நரியென்று 💯💯💯
Aljasiara was paid by ................😂
රනිල් ❤ Ranil ❤ he had the backbone to face these morons.. bunch of terrorist mentalists...
Ha ha  Is this really journalist 😮 look at his kindergarten  questions, why you attained former president's birthday party... 😂 Even he is not letting to him give his answer proper.😂 No doubt this is come from dummy mouth 😂  Are you sure is this full interview or cut and edited like before done with Ms Kamala harris 😂 Oh poor  Al jazeera 😅
This interview should be telecasted in big screens for the public in Sri Lanka
I WISH THAT MEHDI INTERVIEWED MR THAN RW on the war crimes.
Nobody can't remember or talking about the Sinhalese civilians killed by LTTE. The supporters for a sepearate land in SriLanka  get together with Aljazeera are throwing stones  to  one person. It's not fare. Some of the questions are not relevant to him at least. LTTE is a brutal terrorists organisation and was banned by the Western Countries . They were scared to LTTE. But they wanted LTTE to destroy Sri Lanka. But they couldn't do that. Mahinda Rajapaksha defeated the war and Sri Lanka is a peaceful country now. This interview shows the grudge of the Western Countries against Sri Lanka. They were trying sevondly put us down economically . Ranil Wickramasingha managed to save the country from the Economic crisis. Now they are trying to humiliate our people bringing our leaders to this kind of biased forums. People who are cheering the interview should be ashamed. Specially if they are Sri Lankans.
THAT HOUSE WAS BURNED YES IT WAS A SETTING ALREADY THE VALUABLES WERE REMOVED BEFORE SETTING FIRE
Plz come and teach the way of questioning and the style of handling such personnel for SL journalist ❤️ Respect Al jazeera
Ranil you have  fuked this country again and again and again. Please let us to make it better. And be ready to go to jail
Respect al Jazeera indeed its a awesome interview this should translate and show in local tv channels
world understood how sinhalese government treating Tamils .That conservative MP shame on you.
❤❤ after all රනිල් is on behalf of 🇱🇰 Srilanka....  Aljazera is not here to rescue our issues..😢  why cant our people understand this
The cheapest journalist ever seen in international media forums...
Mr.Mehedi Hassan, u r doing the best. We are still struggling for justice
Great job Aljazira.
as a sri lankan I can tell you if it wasn't for former president Ranil Wickramasinghe Sri Lanka will be in deepshit right now. most Sri Lankans don't understand economics
අතින් අරන් පස්ස පැත්තෙන් තියාගන්නවා කියන්නේ මේකට තමා 😂😂
Ranil failed😂
I am happy to see this. No one had the backbone to ask this from this vampire. I wish this will tranalate to sinhala and  shown to comen man in our country.
Aljazeera correspondent’s abilities to take on Ranil Wicremasinghe are absolutely brilliant! The latter was trying to chicken out! Rajapakses and him are rogues who robbed and plundered Sri Lanka’s wealth! Well done !
May be this is the first time where he met someone who he cannot defeat 😅 Best interview in sri lanka  Best one  Love it Great legend  This would be a climax video for those who were in trouble/confusion 😂❤
Please translate in Tamil  my kindly request
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 from the River to the Sea!
MrM,you asked the question &the answer &used the so called interview for your agenda we all wanted to here W answers.not yours  you should stick to lecture's
The event appears to have attendees who may have affiliations or sympathies with the Tamil Tigers, a group known for its past involvement in terrorism. The country has faced significant hardships due to such activities, and we acknowledge the efforts of the armed forces in ensuring national security. If individuals deeply care about the country, contributing to its progress from within would be more meaningful than leaving during difficult times. Please do not encourage or promote terrorism.
THE 1ST THING WOULD ALWAYS, BE MAJORITY OF SRILANKAN TAMILS; BE TO LEAVE IT TO THE  UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WHERE UK, US .CANADA; PRESENTS OUR  CASE AND GET JUSTICE FROM THE UNHRC. THE COMMISIONER OF UN HRC REQUESTED TO SUBMIT THE EVIIDENCE IN THE YEAR 2021 MITCHELLE BATCHLET  REQUESTED THE TAMIL.MPS & STILL. NOT SUBITTED AND UN HRC SRILANKA ACCOUNTABLITY PROECT! UNHRC IS PUSHING TO. GET COLLECT THE EVIDENCE AND  GIVEN ONE MORE YEAR UP TO 2026!!!  AND THE EVIDENCE COLLECTION IS IN THE HANDS OF THE TAMILS AND I HAVE REQUESTED THE TAMI MPS AND THE BRITISH TAMIL FORUM AND TGTE MINISTER IN UK MANIVANAN TO SPEAK TO RUDRAKUMARAN DEFACTO PRIME MINISTER OF TGTE 2 YEARS AGO HOPE THEY WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO AL JAZEEEA INTERVIEW WITH RANIL WIKRAMASINGHA AND HOPE THEY WILL QUICKLY COMPLY WITH THE.UN HRC REQUEST TO COLLECT THE EVIDENCE SRILANKA TAMIL DIASPORA  TO SUBMIT THE EVIDENCE OF ALL THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIO 28:02E NS IN THE YEAR 2021, UPTODAT UPTODATE
ALSO THIS GUY THE PUPPET PRESIDENT OF RAJAPAKSHAS HAD 92 ADVISORS IN HIS OFFICE.CAN YOU BELIEVE. SO IT IS USELASS DISCUSSING WITH HIM HE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE
Ranil left 😂
🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰 Ranil Wickremesinghe was not elected by the Sri Lankan people as President; he was appointed through the Rajapaksas' political maneuvering.... 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰  ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයෙක් විදිහට මම අකමැතිම පුද්ගලයෙක් (බල තන්හාව හා මාන්‍ය ) ....
Was this event sponsored by the LTTE ? It appeared that way at least! No mention about the cold blooded henious crimes committed by the worst terror organization of all time.  No mention about scores of Tamil children, women, elders held for months on end as cattle, as Human Shields, eventually rescued by the SL army in the final stages of the conflict. I am no supporter of Ranil Wickremesinghe, but surely Mehdi Hasan could have done better on that count, in letting the world know also, the other side of the SL civil war.
Hats off al Jazeera for showing this mob's career
If ranil had stayed away from rajapakshe family he would have been a president of sl for long time
the best show on earth.
Absolutely a petulant child than an experienced politician.
Very talented journalist in the world thanks
He is a really bad politician? One of the main responsible person for the current situation of the country, thanks for revealing such culprit to the world 🫡
Mehdi retire pls before you become a shame to your family..what a cheap journalist...No wonder you got kicked out from MSNBC ..The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment and shear hatred on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the preplanned smearing plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...What a waste of money they were surely thinking...hahaha what sore losers😝😝 these tamil rascist terrorist diaspora has become more and more pathetic with their own fantasized theories  even after 15 years since defeat at mullivaikal...they will soon rot in their own hate along with that rascist white witch of a journalist 😂😂😂😂what a treat to watch these miserable people rotting in their own rascism and hatred🎉
this planed for gotabaya for Easter attacks
thank you al jazzera ❤❤❤❤
Thanks Aljaseera
We hate srilnkas this man..he destroyed srilnka
Pray to born a journalist this kind in SL. If under Rajapakshas Govt.....he need additional insurance cover too.
If anyone go through the comment section, the majority who are impressed are tamils who left the xountry during thr war amd funded LTTE to continue theie atrocities
Ester atack you have to take complete responsibility
Mehdi Hasan is an excellent sought after interviewer/host.
According to what I have studied, this man is one of the greatest politicians born in Sri Lanka
RW totally busted. Good interview thumbs
We know very well Ranil Wickramasingha and his political skills about how divert the questions. He's ignoring all crimes committed against Tamils including Tamil Genocide held in 2009. It's very clear that he is trying save Rajapasksa Gang.
👏👏
It's a matter of time to people know the whole truth, that JVP/NPP was funded by Tamil Diaspora
Medi never let ranil to finish his talk.
Excellent Al Jazeera you have been done tremendous job.
Hello Mehdi Hassan, lots of love from Sri Lanka. You made history brother. Keep the good work up. God bless you. 👍🏻😊❤️🙏🏻
This is not the exact video. It was a 2-hour interview. This proves that Aljazeera is not integrity, as you say. How much did you take from Tamil Diaspora?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸✅.       Tamil eelam💩❌
Thank you for sharing
Interview Gota next time pleasseeeee!!!!!!!
It’d be interesting to see all the Rajapaksa and My3 PS join the debate too. It would add more color, crime, and corruption happened in their leadership. I didn’t watch the Mahinda's birthday party karaoke show 😂😂😂
The worst and manipulative news agency. Completely biased amd promote extremism in every sense. This channel called al kazeera should be boycotted for promoting terrorism. But tbey cant do because tbey are funded by them i guess
Why don't you bring Putin to an interview ☺️... How many he has killed 🤔 how about other leaders ? Can you bring them down to the interview? Mind your own business,

கெலைகார  கும்பல்
Ranil is an absolute moron, who just wanted power at any cost
Watched this interview with complete disgust. This was not an interview—it was a blatant display of disrespect toward the former Sri Lankan President. Instead of conducting a fair and balanced discussion, the panel seemed intent on attacking and undermining him.  The presence of PEARL, an organization based in the USA known for its efforts to discredit Sri Lanka, further exposed the biased nature of this so-called interview. It was evident that the discussion was not meant to facilitate meaningful dialogue but rather to corner and pressure the President.  A major concern is the complete absence of any Sinhalese representation. How can such an interview claim to be fair and objective when there is no effort to include diverse perspectives? Instead, the President was subjected to a hostile interrogation, with multiple participants talking over him, dismissing his responses, and refusing to engage in a respectful conversation.  While it is understandable that tough questions need to be asked in any high-profile interview, this was not responsible journalism—it was an ambush. The sheer imbalance, combined with the presence of individuals aligned with anti-Sri Lankan narratives, raises serious questions about the motives behind this interview. Where was the UK High Commission while the Sri Lankan President was essentially placed in a firing line, forced to reveal national matters under intense pressure?  If Al Jazeera claims to uphold journalistic integrity, then we challenge them to conduct an interview with Donald Trump or any other Western leader in the same aggressive and disrespectful manner. Would they dare speak to them like this? Or is this biased treatment reserved for certain nations and leaders? Why was no mention of the terrorist activities of the LTTE Tigers?  This was an utterly disgraceful interview, devoid of professionalism, fairness, or genuine journalistic ethics.

Hats Off AlJazeera for this interview. As a country whole sri lankan people would be really thankful to you for exposing these culprits to the world. Respect to everyone who brought this program up.
AMMO PUKA DEEPU PARAMPARAWALA LANKAWE GOTHAYAGE COMMENTS GODA
Rani Wickramasinghe is an International Level Leader who is missed by ignorant Sri Lankans.
Good stuff! Mehdi really exposes politicians like Ranil who’ve damaged the country just as much as the Rajapaksas. Both sides get called out for wrecking Sri Lanka equally—powerful and spot-on!
❤❤❤❤❤❤ the great level of journalism.Tnx aljazira
Bravo Al Jazeera ❤
Thank you, Aljazeera, 🙏🙏🙏
Ranil is flabbergasted
What a journalist ♥️
Real Mr.Been  😂😂😂
Singhalese government is not less than an Israeli government. Institutional terrorism against ethnic Tamils. Still tamil don't considered as equal citizens. With only two ethnic groups and not living in harmony. Rajapakshe is also a separatist and were hailed as hero in majority singhalese. There were rapes and tortures done by rajapakshe and  war crimes are hidden by these type of hypocritical leaders like Ranil, who himself a supporter of Rajapakshe even today.
Thank you Al Jazeera❤
U won't get honest answers from his words, no matter what until he gives up or opening up his self.....
Well done Hon.Ranil Wickramasinghe
enaku ennamo muthalvan padam paakuraa poalaye iruku  😆
Wow very brave questioning ... Ranil is a power hungry fox, tyrant & cunning politician as his uncle former president JR Jayawardane.   He is the most responsible person who made bankrupt Srilanka who was taking plenty of sovereign  bonds in Good Governance regime .. But need to give time to answer too.. Thank you Al jezeera..
We are none violence nation ,  මෙන්න මෙතැනදී තමයි රයිනි ක්‍රමසිංහ පොඩ්ඩක් ඇන ගත්තෙ. , වී ආ නන්වාලන් නේෂන් කියන ඒ තරම් සුදුසු නෑ එතකොට තමයි මෙදි කිව්වේ ආ 100000 මරලා දාලා කොටලා දාලා
Thanks for the Aljazeera journalist interview with RW and trying to bring the truth out of his mouth. This is the true journalism and independent reporting well done
We all know what you and Jayawardena did 😂😂😂  Both are murderers to the extent Prabhakaran look like a innocent person 😂😂😂
👌
Broo crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is a one-sided interview.     The intentions are very clear behind these questions, and  the way the  journalist is handling the interview.
Journalist ❤
Ranil felt upset as he faced for a real journalist
What i believe the majority of commentoters does not know what is the politics, Ranil is more mature than you all...Aljasira is not your friend....all seaters are very much enemies than Ranil....
Thank you Mehdi Hasan. This was truly refreshing to watch. Great eloquence, professionalism and quick wit. Sri lankan journalists please take notes. Haali liyanne nathuwa.

Jihadi dog mehdi
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Al-Jazeera media for conducting such a brilliant and insightful interview with the former President/Prime Minister. The interviewer's deep knowledge of Sri Lanka's political landscape, thoughtful questions, and in-depth analysis truly made it an enlightening discussion. This kind of journalism not only informs the public but also contributes to a more informed and democratic society. Thank you Mr.Mehdi Hasan for your dedication to quality reporting!
THAT was not an interview. It was a one sided session of bullying and putting words into the minds of the adience by this interviewer Mehdi. It was clearly aparent that Mr Wickramasinghe was not given a single chance to talk and the adience was forced to listen to what the interviewer wanted to say. His (Mehdi) show and everyone had to only listen to him. Wickramasinghe was not given a chance.
I am not a supporter of Ranil or his political ideology, nor do I endorse corruption. However, after watching this interview, it is evident that it was pre-planned and scripted to target Sri Lankan Sinhalese, orchestrated by the LTTE terrorist organization and facilitated by Al Jazeera. Despite being defeated by the Sri Lankan government, the LTTE continues to pursue its separatist agenda, seeking to divide the people for its own benefit. Shame on Mehdi Hasan for being a part of this, which reflects a clear lack of professionalism.  I appreciate that Ranil did his best to defend himself and Sri Lanka as a nation against such biased accusations ,and I challenge Mehdi Hasan and Al Jazeera to demonstrate their journalistic integrity by hosting a similar discussion with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the near future.
The audience  is biased,the interviewer is biased,the board of   "experts" are biased,the venue, britain  is historically  biased. What can i  take from this interview?
Pleaae invite Mahinda Rajapajsha or Namal Rajapaksha next time
The number of Sri Lankan's seeing Ranil getting in trouble do not see how Al-Jazeera fixed the interview with selected LTTE supporters to establish allegations on war crimes. No wonder why Sri Lanka is not progressing to safe guard sovereignty and development !
Please translate this interview in Sinhalese and telecast in Sri Lankan national media to understand how corrupt Former president Ranil wikcramasinghe is. I think lots of past Sri Lankan politicians are corrupted and pathetic like him.
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a murderer who killed 60,000 young men and women in 1988/89. Thanks you al jazeera
Hats off for the journalist. From sri lanka. ❤❤❤
Im not a RW fan at all. But talking about the civil war in an AC hall full of people who fled/haven't seen the war about war crimes committed is rather funny. You never witnessed or addressed about the harassment done by the LTTE. What about that then. But yeah, Im pretty sure the military violated a hella lot of human rights. It was a war. And you weren't there. LTTE masacred people, yes it doesn't give the right to haress tamil people but LTTE also harassed the tamils. Who's supposed to answer that. This is sort of a setup unfortunately. I really came here to laugh at Ranil Wickramasinghe trying to answer questions😂😂😂I did but, watching this I realized this was setup to humiliate him and accuse him of crimes against tamils. Al jazeera You're trying to bring up an issue we are trying to forget for the sake of unity of this country.
This man has blood on his hands.buterlander?
RW is an enabler. He empowered the corrupted system just coz he wanted the top position. Somehow and anyhow. Shameless!
Ranil is a batalanda killer.
i want to see Mehdi go head to head with President Trump
seeya fumbled so hard that there is no recovery from this
😂😂😂
All the Sinhala Buddhists who come here and claim to be healed, How many of you actually carry the guilt of Tamil Genocide? Or are you just here to watch your ex-president get roasted and eat popcorn?
I don't think this is proper journalism.  RW is the only president who can give a good run to this foolish journalist.   No respect
Ranil is a fox. He is also one of the key- persons behind the Jaffna library burning🔥.  He is a silent genocidal murderer.
This cunning old guy is one of the reasons SL went downhill for many decades. Now he's acting like a baby.
He pretending to be a Buddhist but he really is a Anglican 😂😂😂
“Ranil Wickremesinghe conveniently avoided answering why he sabotaged the international criminal prosecution mechanism for Tamil genocide when he was the Prime Minister in 2015.  First, he hijacked the UNHRC process pretending to be cooperating with international community and co-sponsoring a hybrid mechanism, then ensured no progress is made. This is a carefully crafted strategy to deflect the pressure on Srilankan state to buy time to escape an international scrutiny and initiate an international criminal justice mechanism. He helped the decision makers including Rajapaksa’s who perpetrated heinous crimes against Tamils.  Let those in “denial mode” have to come out from their comfort zone. There are mounting evidence against the Srilankan state and in the command structure available and continue to be collected. Tamil victims community and INGOs have shared those evidence to the UN OSLAP mechanism.   No way those perpetrators can escape from international justice process. It’s a matter of time.
Thak u @Aljazeera try to  showing the real face in sri lanka Respect
26:53 Ranil gone 😊
He is one of the big reason  2009 he did the genocide hundred thousand people die in northern part of vanni tamil ellam.  (he is also mihinda rajapase  family) central bank robbery big mafia. And also 1980 his is political party did jaffna library destroyed..
Ranil wickramasinghe is a great leader who face the truth
🔥
If someone reads these comments it's easy to find ltte terrorists sperms 💩 and they are very pleased now 😂
Thank you so much Aljazeera ❤. Real journalist ❤
Sorry ''white west''' - your time is over!!! We are not your colony
Ltte terrorists are still living in the Srilankan community unfortunately. Some of them have sinhala names as well.   Those are very happy for this kind of shits.   Ltte diaspora has paid well and handed over their script for the journalist 😂
Imagine an interview between this journalist and Basil, Gota, MR or Namal 😅
Coming up next => Namal Rajapaksha
❤️❤️💪💪💪Al Jazeeera👍👍💪💪💪congregations ❤❤ i from srilanka 👍
Good job aljazeera 👍
what an interview Mr.Mehdi , hats off to you
Like 😮
Why are you interviewing the culprits of the economic downturn? This guy is a monster who brutally tortured and murdered thousands of young men in the 80s. Also a shameless politician who supported corruption. It was not a mob it was the people who were suffering. They were protesting to convey their suffering to the rulers. They did not murder anyone. It was the government which murdered and committed arson so that they can blame the people and crack down the protest. This man claims that he did not have money to hold elections but orders millions of rupees worth of tear gas to crack down protesters. This madman is a cunning viper.
In a realistic sense every politician has a breaking point and this was Ranil’s. The tone of the interviewer was a little too aggressive at times yet it worked out perfectly for a man who’s been using cheap strategies to avoid questions for decades. Yet someone like Trump or JP would’ve shut this down in no time. Luckily Ranil isn’t anywhere near that even though Sri Lankan media has created an image as such for him.
When questions about political favoritism and corruption especially the Easter attacks allegations, were raised he simply covered it up by telling meaningless Buddhist stories. This is how politics has been done in Sri Lanka for so long by dividing people using religion and ethnicity.
ඩයස්පෝරා නාලිකාව 😂
Nice work hasan. You opened many peoples eyes. Thankyou Hasan. I'm srilankan
කොටි පකයොන්ව ආයේ ආවත් ඉවර කරනවා මේක සිංහල අපේ රට
What a Joker 😂😂😂
Everyone in Sri Lanka should watch this interview and understand what Ranil, and the wider Sinhala establishment, has done to the ENTIRE nation.   Unfortunately, that will never happen...
Mehdi hasan❤🎉
Please invite next time our former president Anura Kumara Dissanayaka😊
100% of sri lankan are not native english 😂, most of them cant understand whats going here and take aljazeera shouter side because they couldnt understand the english , ranil win the game thats it
I'm a Sri Lankan. We are a proud nation that defeated terrorism. We know that you and Western countries are jealous of this. That’s why you interfere in Sri Lanka to create social and economic crises. You don’t question other countries, such as Israel, America, or Ukraine, about war crimes. Why? Because they are powerful nations. We will take care of our country—don’t worry.
🟥 The Al Jazeera journalist asks if you created the Batalanda torture chamber. In that discussion, Ranil Wickremesinghe denies everything about Batalanda, but the journalist again asks about the Trincomalee youth Vincent Fernando who testified at the Batalanda Commission! Then Ranil gets upset and answers angrily!  Ranil Wickremesinghe's boyfriend Vincent Fernando has revealed before three judges his love affair with Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Batalanda Commission, how he capriciously deceived him, and the horrific torture carried out at the Batalanda torture chamber on Ranil's orders. This statement was ordered to be taken secretly before the three judges by Ranil's friend and relative Chandrika Bandaranaike. Ranil Wickremesinghe tells Al Jazeera that Vincent Fernando did not appear before the commission and gave evidence. It is true. Vincent Fernando gave evidence in private. His classmates had also taken steps to prevent it from being included in the commission report. However, the actual statement of his lover, Vincent Fernando, which Ranil Wickremesinghe rejected, is still with the chairman of the commission, either with the judges or with Chandrika. Chandrika used it only to intimidate Ranil during the 1999 election against Ranil.  Two weeks after Vincent Fernando gave his statement, Ranil Wickremesinghe was summoned before the Batalanda Commission. Vincent Fernando had died secretly a week before Ranil was summoned before the Batalanda Commission. It was later revealed that Vincent Fernando had been poisoned to death. The crime had been committed using Police Inspector Sudath Chandrasekara, Ranil Wickremesinghe's main bodyguard. A detailed account of this is recorded in the book "Batalandata Ginilema" by veteran journalist Nandana Weeraratne Soyura.  - Copied.
Thank you very much
If a Sri Lankan interviewer spoke like that, he could live in heavan then😅😅
Good job bro
President trup blame al jazeera that thay publish lie
Al jazzera! U tried a lot to make ranil , rajapaksha murderers but there are no pure proven evidences on both of them to convict them as murderers…. All they did was just ruled the country well.. that’s why lots of LTTE terrorists and their supporters( tamil diaspora) are being hurt so much… no room for those terrorists again here in sri lanka … whatever u say majority of sihalese in sri lanka supports both of these leaders…. AND AGAIN! YOU TRIED TO PLAY GAMES AL JAZZERA! BUT THOSE GAMES DON’T MAKE SENSE! Except for some sri lankan idiots( assuming those who are so intelligent) and  for terrorists
“No contest” ~ by Ranil Wickramasinghe the great💪🏽😼
He destryoed our country
More times was allocated for questioning and but not for answering questions. Allegations were made without any evidence by journalists. Unfair questions without providing time to explain. No tolerance and respect given to respected president. No manners or discipline displayed by journalists
appreciate.....
We hope Srilankan TV chanels also will get this type of journalists to defeat all the corrupt politicians in the county,  wether Sinhalees, Tamil or Muslim
Mahdi hassen 🎉🎉🎉👏நெருப்பு 🥰🇩🇪
Mehdi Hasan 🤟
I am really satisfied with the interview ❤ 🇱🇰❤
I think Ranil has scored well. We have to forget past and move on. I know Tamils in Sri Lanka don’t want another conflict as the rebels were the culprits of most of their sufferings. Wounds are healing don’t dig them please
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍🇩🇪ரணில் விக்கிரமசிங்கே 💯💯👠🇩🇪

What an idiot interviewer. I’m not a fan of Ranil but let your guest finish answering the questions

Oh my god. He really has become professor at the lying faculty 😂😂🥲😡
Cunning Dictator lying in this conversation.
6000 disappearances is this a joke for you. This triggered ranil 28:04
Why Mr mehedi didnt allow to Mr wikramasinha to explain.Poor journalism
AL Jazeera news reporter He is doing a great job. Srilankan reporters don't have  Gust two questions this criminal. Thank you AL Jazeera.
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe is like Mr. Bean. Also, I feel that the journalist doesn't have limits when talking.
Dont throw the Stories Ranil ,just answer the questions ,Youre not the real president what we expect n that time ,also you have to take all the responsibility for all f i n corruptions did by rajapaksha ,You was the president not only minister .
Respect journalist ❤
He wasn’t qualified to be interviewed. He has to be punished
Mad journalist... fist time i saw..
Finally this idiot got Humbled 😂
Well done Al Jazeera !  Lots of love from Sri Lanka for revealing this man 😂❤🎉
බටලන්දේ  කොල්ලො ගානක් මරපු මිනිමරුවා😒😏
27:18 😂😂
As a journalist, you should be asking questions, yes, but also give the individual your questioning their time to answer your questions to the best of their knowledge instead of being childish by talking over him and cutting him off mid sentence and should maintain your composer by keeping professionalism and not be easy on the temper
What a great interview this is. I have never seen RW cornered this much in a interview. As a politician RW is so much corrupted but regarding the war crimes this is a bad influence for name of the sri lanka in a war people die in both parties how are they talking about war crimes done by sri lankan army while neglecting the much worse crimes done by LTTE.
Thank you 🙏 Al Jazeera ❤
Always lion come alone not with a team like fox. Remember the name  King 👑 RANIL❤🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
First of all, a horrible journalist with no manners. Try doing the same with Donald Trump… wouldn’t go well
Good, we need to expose this kind of political criminals to the world, whos is hiding behind small countrys' constitutions and plays with millions of peoples lives
Thanks a lot asking like good question. Ranil wickramasinghe met a real journalist 😍
Ranil is cooked
Great journalist 👏🏼 👍🏼 👌🏼
Dictator /  joker
👍👍👍👌👌👌
Ranil Wickremesinghe is the owner of the Batalanda torture chamber
Mehdi needs some social skills. The constant baiting and interrupting just makes him look petulant.
You have the likes of Mehdi Hasan, but we have Chamuditha 😛😛
Thank you for removing the clothes of a fraudulent politician in sri lanka.❤️
After asking questions not giving time to reply & interrupting the reply is the most rude & ugly thing to do in any news channels.
He’s the reason for most of the crimes 😢😢😢
Firstly it was good conversation and when the end it more like tamil program
Ranil😂😂😂..Aljazeera👏👏👏👏
Run the presidency or not none of you business idiot it's a metal post Sri Lankan people who are who the f*** you are
It Sri Lankan war tactics is been referred and gaza is suffering then its really sad 😢
Who broke Sri Lanka? The list is long. 1) India 2) NATO 3) China 4) Russia (previously the Soviet Union)
Lunatic Ranil Wickramasinghe 😅
Ranils and Rajapakses  are good friends and he is covering the evil Rajapakses   This guy Ranil should be jailed for life, for killing 1000s in Batalanda  camp.  People can see Ranil can't answer questions, and he is covering Rajapakses, top journalist from Al Jazeera!
what a scum!! shame on you Ranil.
This is ltt terrorist group and attacking promo president and attacking to the country this is the terrorist organization and the terror is organizations members are in the audience what you talking about the human rights we supple a lot of Sri Lankan Buddhist people die more than 60,000 any suction Mano woman or dogboe Beach talk about that things
යැයි යැයි තමා 😂
The ranil the underworld leader
Thank you al jazeera. Excellent work. Hats off.  Regards from sri lankan citizens.  🙏❤️
Countries are more dangerous illegal weapon selling corruption doing human trafficking human trafficking illegal drug selling you guys destroying world and same time talking about human rights best look after the country and you can't repeat people what they do into other people and come back to Sri Lanka
He Well studies more than sri lankan journalist..before the interview.. Today ranil totally lost in English face to face 😂
✍️Although he is correct or Not, Even any single sri lankan should not be helpless/ being disgrace in front of other nations like this. I m 100% NPP Party voted one. Never voted for Mr. Ranil. But here this is not genuine journalism.  As Sri Lankans we all should be the Sri Lankan one's side. .
White woman violation millions millions of human rights killing selling bombs selling weapons selling illegal drugs what do you talking about are you clear get lost
Hi that you are between leg white man's
Respect al jazeera❤❤ from sri lanka
I get your p****
His replies are so disturbing, the way he talks also
thanks Al Jazeera.......we never saw like this intervive before with Ranil Wickramasinghe. next namal rajapaksha.
Probably Ranil went to face his own trial without knowing this gonna happen. Bravoo Mehdi. We couldn't get him to a court and do this, but you and Al Jazeera did.
Thank you Al Jazeera . Sri Lankan call him Sri Lankan Mr Bean
There is no personality to be a president at all.  Look at his actions .ping pong. You will never expect honesty from any srilankan politicians. Any wrong doing. I think Mehdi would have met a most terrible leader . I think Ranil would have come for this to impress to show he's the best srilanka could have. But it turned out to be the useless person to have in the parliament.
Thanks for pealing off this old foxes 🦊 barbaric conduct with his good old friend Rajapaksha ! This guy is one big reason for my country to suffer! Ethnic violence for all these years is their main game to come to power ! But we ended it unitedly with people’s president AKD
what a clown...disgrace to the nation
Super exalent .ranil wicramasinghe      mental Persian.
ජෙපි මාධ්‍යවේදියෙක් නේත 😂😂
He didn’t walk out and stayed throughout and 2 hour discussion cut to 50 minutes. Post the full version. It was fun Mr Ranil played you well.
Who is the Sydney University women no responsibilities such ever blamed to that sort of things without any evidence she must go to the jail because line to world
Why the heck your don’t release the whole video the hamas puppet
Iorny is Al Jazeera asking Who killed innocent people on palm Sunday? Doesn't matter what politicians doing it is Islam terrorism. Which is Al Jazeera try to protect. Al Jazeera can't be trusted it is a terrorist media.
Respect sir❤
You b**** come to those Australia by boat as a refugee and you did all the corruption in this country and get the loopholes and good went to the university and get the position and now you talking about Sri Lanka get lost Beach
This interview made me heal in many ways. 🙏 thanks for the courage you have shown ,confronting Ranil. He is nothing but cold blooded killer and he will do anything to protect the dynasty.  I left Batalanda and the country to protect my children. Karma has its own way . Ranil belongs in a dark cell. Why is he still acting like innocent ? ?????
Local election were due in 2022 February, but it was postponed for 2023 February and this guy influenced and cancelled the elections, which he would have lost,
Hats off to Al Jazeera.❤❤❤❤
Serves Ranil well for trying to treat Mehdi like the Sri lankan media... Couldn't believe he thought he could get away talking like that to International media.
That evil woman is a white woman exactly evil blood demanding blood sucker

Great news 🗞️🗞️🗞️🗞️🗞️
Nirj calling paramilitary killing squad Karuna group as "Democratic group"? Typical boot licker.
Let the man talk al Jazeera.  What is this journalism? typical debate with a Muslim.  It's like Talking to a wall.

Ranil Wickramasinghe... The Loras Tyrell of Sri Lanka
Up to the Castle Street don't come to Sri Lanka Sri Lanka is the Buddhist country no enough the religions allowed to
Al Jazeera🫡🫡🫡🫡
Hats off to Madhura Rasaratnam.
Thank you Al JAZEERA for INTERVIEW❤❤❤ more more needed! God Have! God knows everything!
Ranil is a layer, criminal and one of the leading corrupt politician
Aljazeera is a propaganda garbage just like BBC, no self respecting human would ever participate in a sit down with them, Ranil just walked into a hit job. All these people asking questions are preplanned propaganda actors, Sri Lanka must be very careful as the founders of these propaganda machine must be eying for causing mass casualties event in Sri Lanka
Ranil is a  murderer
I saw a man struggling on a chair to escape from questions . That's how they've always ruled our country.respect al jazeera
I love you Al jazeer
This white woman aganinst to sri lanka i wish this  interview panel are criminal organisation
11:32 Nailing the  coffin. 🤣
Thanks to mehdihasan & Al Jazeera . you nailed it
Great job!
They are money grabbers.
For the rest of the world, Rajapaksha family escapes from court cases due to technical issues
Thank you Al Jazeera. We are expecting more & more head to head interviews from Sri Lanka.
I can't understand what the president did to the country and he didn't want to take any responsibilities. He said he didn't know what happened and how much damage to the people of Sri Lanka. He must have lived in La ...La....La land.
There should be all ethnicities involved in questioning. The country lost not only the innocent Tamils but sinhalese who lived in the villages as well.
Ranil is directly responsible for economical collapse of Sri Lanka
Well done Al jazeera 👍
This can't be a journalist only a Stupid clown.
Sri Lankan Journalists should also be like exactly this. But unfortunatly it will take another decade to reach that level. See the reporter's confidents and preperation. And the way of talikg. Not like Chathura Chamuditha and even Sirasa reporters
Bad that the journalist doesnt allow him to answer.
Thank you, Al Jazeera
Everyone wanted change, but when the country was in chaos, it was Ranil who put things back on track. Leadership isn’t about winning popularity contests it’s about making hard choices when it matters. Say what you will about Ranil, but he stepped up when Sri Lanka was on the brink of collapse. Inflation dropped from 70% to 1.3%, and the economy stabilized under his leadership. Unpopular decisions? Yes. But sometimes, stability comes at a cost. History might judge him better than his critics do today.
Dear sri lankan’s pleaae lean from mr mehdi
Strawman arguement falacy
Hats off for the jurnalist for doing such a great job
So glad, people are globally aware of what has been happening in this country even though some of our own citizens deny the truth.  Fantastic interview with next level journalism!
Ranil is a known corrupt politician, but no one has questioned him with real backbone. He should be exposed.
❤❤❤
There should be sinhala and tamil subtitle of this video so that most of locals could get to know the true nature of this goons and their childish behaviour infront of international media..m
All the people of Sri Lanka will testify to arrest him. He is the torturer of Batalanda. He has killed 60,000 young men and women.
Interview current president Anura kumara Dissanayaka also like this 😊
Why don't you interview responsible executive presidents instead of him?
Ranil , finally u met  a real journalist 😂
Direct questions with proper evidence. Lucky to see journalist like you and I'd like to thank you for Sri Lanka❤️🙏
Bruh Mehdi is a G!He really did his research and knew internal issues as much as a native Sri lankan.For a minute i forgot Mehdi wasnt a Sri lankan.
When he has no answers, he tells the journalist that he is off his head.      He anger crops up because he is desperate. He hoodwinked his party, and it broke, and the smart guys left him as they were not able to tolerate his dictatorship attitude..
This man was trying to show off and trying whitewash himself, instead he lost and  re-opened the dirty past and blackmarked the whole country for nothing.  The interview was very obvious a well-planned setup. This is a good lesson for Sri Lankan media people (unresearched) who don’t know what to question but always ready to put the mike in front to any idiot for commenting to give them publicity. He has no rights to talk about Sri Lankan people at large now, as he is now a common man not representing the SL government at all. What if this was done by a layperson, How, will SL media and Govt react??
This guy never won an election. He is another distraction to the country. Ranil is a Rajapalsa's colon. This guy's friend robbed the central bank and he didn't do a dam thing. The President of Sri Lanka controls everything.  That idiot Nirj Deva was talking about RW's house being destroyed. He forgot how RW was involved in the burning of the Jaffna Public Library .
Thank you for all the questions you asked this man who has destroyed many young lives. Even today, we continue to suffer because of his actions and those of his accomplices. A heartfelt thanks from the Sri Lankan people. If our native Tamil and Sinhala communities could understand this interview, they would welcome you with flowers.
Outstanding journalism. Hats off to Al Jazeera
What he does is if any question has a direct impact on him turn it into a joke otherwise you can see the Lion If you want a real grill bring any of the Rajapaksha s , but make sure get them wear a diaper first.
Give This Journalist A Raise Cause He Roasted Ranil 💀
Absolute cinema🙌 I still don't know how some people can bear with this disgusting creature laughing at 200 dead people from the Easter attack.
Mr. Bean is better than this idiot.
Genocide done to Tamil will never come to Table . Will not have remorse from Sengali’s
Next get the current SL president Anura to do an interview!!! He also has so much to answer for including all the murders by the JVP!!! 😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀
It should be corrected as 6 times failed prime minister 😂
Thank you Al Jazeera and Mehdi Hassan for interviewing this culprit and showing his true face to the world.
Best interview in al jazeera
Some says that wife of Mahinda Rajapaksha is a relative to Ranil Wickramasinghe because her maiden name is Wickramasinghe. That's why he maybe not taken action against Rajapakshas when he was the president. I think that's why lost the presidential election.
Respect that journalist ❤
RIP ranil 😂😂
I wish we could have the journalists like you🙏
This is the same guy who laughed Infront of media when Easter attack happened. What a disgrace
This guy is a war criminal. So many Tamils had been butchered by this kind of Sinhala politicians.
This should be a netflix roast special
Thank you for your story about the Buddha😂 You can't distract him.
Someone please mention “road rage”. “He should not be crossing” … I guess former president Ranil will just be jury, judge and executioner in that case.
මු රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ නෙමෙයි රනිල් රාජ්‍යපක්ෂ කියලා මුළු ලෝකෙම දන්නවා. අනේ ඉතින් ලොක්කටත් වෙච්ච වැඩේ🤭...
Great and Realist Questions and Typical SL Politicians’ Answers
ONCE AT PARLIAMENT R.W. ALONG WITH HIS PARLIAMENT MEMBERS WAS SHOUTING THAT RAJAPAKSES ARE THIEVES!  BUT LATER HE BECAME AS BEST FRIEND OF THEM FOR HIS PRESIDENCY IN 2022😢
Mehdi should go head-to-head with Donald Trump Donald J. Trump or Narendra Modi Narendra Modi—that would be a real showdown. Instead, what we got here is nothing more than propaganda-driven journalism targeting developing nations.  In politics, there’s always a balancing act for the greater good. The reality is, RW had to make tough political decisions to maintain stability.  As for the so-called war crimes—these are baseless allegations. In any war, casualties are inevitable, and yes, many Tamil civilians suffered because the LTTE used them as human shields. Defeating the LTTE was the only way to ensure a united Sri Lanka. The world’s major powers—whether it’s the U.S., Russia, or Israel—have done the same in their own conflicts, yet Sri Lanka is singled out. No one believed we could fully defeat the LTTE, but we did.  That being said, have we done enough for the Tamil people in the years since? No, we’ve failed. RW and MR fell short in delivering what Tamils rightfully deserve. I really hope AKD could grant what is rightfully theirs, this has to be solved.   And finally, RW brought zero substance to this interview. It was a disaster. He should have been better prepared to counter a blatant propaganda piece like this. Maybe he’s just not the right man for such a debate. We need leaders like Lakshman Kadirgamar, Lalith Athulathmudali, and J.R. Jayewardene—people who could hold their ground on the global stage.  It’s embarrassing to see Sri Lankans cheering for an interview that does nothing but push a biased narrative against small nations like ours.
Stay home ranil

Ranil facing real journalist in he's life
No one questioned before like the way this journalist did.. Even not Lanka Journalists💥
As a Sri Lankan ,Really appreciate your answers former president honorable Ranil Wikramasinghe, who was raise the country after the crisis ... Really respectable leader in Sri Lanka.
Ranil ❤❤❤❤
Ranil is a Batalanda scoundrel
First this journalist should learn how to conduct a interview..
Ranil Rajapaksha, The way he answering the questions like a joker  🤡
Ranil benefited from Tamil votes by portraying himself as someone who cared for them, but even they were betrayed by him, just like all other citizens of Sri Lanka. He entered politics through nepotism and built his connections through a history of corruption and violence. Mahinda Rajapaksa made him president to protect his family’s interests. Anyone in Sri Lanka, except those who benefited from the corrupt system, can see this. Anyone who has studied Ranil Wickremesinghe will recognize his dark side. He is now nothing more than political garbage in Sri Lanka.

all sri lankans need to watch this.all the corrupted politicians must be interviewed like this and bring justice to people who suffer. As a sri lankan I'm so happy and grateful for  this unforgettable interview. Sri lankans suffered for so long some people doesn't even know what it feels like to live in a good country.
This coversation has to be translated for sinhala and tamil speaking  communities
Hats off to mehdi hasan 💪
Ideot ranil.. big liar.. respect jezeera... welldone AJ.
The interview was mostly a one-way debate, well-planned in advance, and satisfied most of the attendees. A kind request to Mehdi: please give some space for the opponent to speak up.
FRAREE.  LICENSE.   GREAT.   BANK.   ROPER.   U N P.  RANIL. ACCIDENT.  AL. JAZEERA.  CAR. NOW .HE  WAS  IN. THE. I. U. C.
Mehdi retire pls before you become a shame to your family..what a cheap journalist...No wonder you got kicked out from MSNBC ..The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment and shear hatred on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the preplanned smearing plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...What a waste of money they were surely thinking...hahaha what sore losers😝😝 these tamil rascist terrorist diaspora has become more and more pathetic with their own fantasized theories  even after 15 since defeat at mullivaikal...they will soon rot in their own hate along with that rascist white witch of a journalist 😂😂😂😂what a treat to watch these miserable people rotting in their own rascism and hatred🎉
He is just bad at communicating. When someone can't defend self, no one else can.
My only  concern is how aljazeera interpreted the war crimes ,have you ever seen a video LTTE tamil tigers killing buddhist devotees just before Sri Maha Bodhi Tree in Anuradhapura.LTTE Tamil tigers recorded it . Why is this hypocrisy of this Tamil diaspora.
😂
Hats off for you great journalist.showing the world true nature of Mr.Ranil  Wickramasinghe.
This man and his predecessors destroyed Srilanka as a country and its place in the world, him and the then UNP tortured people in the 70’s and the 80’s.
Ranil Rajapaksa kept  a straight face and lied through his teeth
Panel should be mixed, not just Tamils supporters so we could get a more refined debate among the audience . Said that fantastic interview we need to question our politicians in this way.
Well done RW.. Another epic failure for Tamil Diaspora. Tamil should grow a pair of balls and fight for their real mother land Tamil Nadu..
Grandpa got fked big time 😂
I think the most accurate and unbiased opinion was, what Dr. Madura Rasaratnam said. Which is indeed the root cause of endless corruption and the absence of good governance in Sri Lanka for the past 70+ years and the reason for nation's failure for decades.   "...Those crimes occurred because you have a political system of which Mr.Wickremesinghe is a part. For the past 70 years that has prioritized ethnocratic politics pleasing the majority at the expense of good governance, at the expense of fairness at the expense of Justice, right, at the expense of efficiency. So what happens when you get that? You get escalating hatred against other groups and you get poor governance leading to economic collapse."
No contest I am not contesting 😇 26:31
Great journalist 👏
No contest I am not contesting 😇
No contest I am not contesting 😇
Ranil wickramasinghe sri lanka   ❤
ranil to NIL
බටලන්ද ඕකෙ ! Crisis ඕකේ ! කොටි සුද්ද කරන්න යන එකනම් වැරදී මෙතන ඉන්න සෙට් එක 💣
Excellent interview, Mahdi
Ranil In 1989 killed 60,000 young university students in camps. They were not criminals, just young people with dreams. If you spoke against the government, you disappeared. Everyone knew what would happen. No one was safe. But in 2021, people had nothing left to lose. We stood up. We broke the silence that had lasted for decades. Mehdi Hasan can speak freely, but we all remember under his rule he would be in a camp too the way he spoke bravely.
Hahaha, this is a real ambush. The British version of Chamuditha: not letting the opponent answer. Some of the questions are good, but it's quite evident that the biased journalist does not want to hear the answer, as he often tries to cut off Ranil.    Protests are welcomed and must take place against corrupt politicians. Gota must be held accountable. However, neither protesters nor the government has any right to murder any human being regardless of their political affiliation. Unfortunately, the peaceful protests turned violent (burning houses, killing politicians), so that had to be stopped. The use of power to stop that mayhem by RW was fine.   The real motive of this interview seems to corner RW, and I do not see a genuine intention to have him answer the questions.  This phenomenon is known as confirmation bias. I would love to hear what the biased Mudra Rasarathnam, Tamil diaspora representative, has to say about her stance on the terrorism carried out by the LTTE on innocent civilians. Would she use the same yardstick? 😉  A journalist who implicitly glorifies the killings of innocent people in Israel on the 7th of October while talking about civil and human rights in Sri Lanka does not look odd but pure hypocrisy. 😅😅
This is one of the best interviews that I have ever watched ❤
Ranil Rajapaksha must go to jail. He is a dictator
This guy is alibaba
That was a war against group of terrorists not against any tamils
I can only see a criminal trying to dilute his crimes like a joker. Ranil Sri Lankan people hate you; remember that at the end.
Former president Ranil should be bought in front of court questions like this, they always play game with Sri Lankan media as most media obey this politicians.kind request if this can translate the conversation or subtitle in local languages will a great work.
Need to interview with gotabaya also
“I have been in politics before you were born” What a strong statement from President RW❤
Anusthing is possible 🙏
He was the one who burned the Jaffna library.  And responsible for starting a war between Tamil and Sinhala people
Srilankan officials were never into the politics with real world considering the human rights / democracy..
Ranil 🤢🤮
We are a non-violation nation- Shame on you Mr Ranil
Hats off to Journalist ❤ Well Done Aljazeera🎉
Medhi is the absolute worst journalist.   No one wants to hear him speak. What's the point of having an interviewee and all we hear is medhi voice
In srilanka no political parties take responsibility
Ranil you are a Christian you converted to Buddhism to suit your political aspirations, dam turn coat
Please change the topic as Discussed with Mr. Bean. this is the one of the major person who destroy the island nation.
සීයා නානවා කැත නෑමක් 😂😂😂😂
🇱🇰❤️ Head to head🫡  Respect,  Meidi  Hassan.😍
No context 😂😂 is epic
Bro got roasted this time. Honestly, Ranil is similar to Trump in politics. Simply a fox in the game. But last decades he was playing politics towards his own prosperity and survival. Unless he could have been a nice politician. Btw, hats off for giving a kick start to the country to raise the head up from financial crisis. That was a solo effort surrounded by a bunch of below the average politicians
Everyone knows and understands what happened. But it cannot be proven. Because Sri Lanka's culture is, appoint commissions and inquiry committees, prepare vague reports, and wasting time and scatter facts and evidence.  All your efforts are in vain. Waste of time :(
🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼🌼Ranil W is the wrong person to answer on the guerilla war.  He has no knowledge of it. Hospitals were used by the terrorists as their bases at the last stages of war. It was a gurilla strategy.  Separatist Combatants wore civilian clothing as a guerilla tactic. A separatist guerilla war against the peoples elected democratic government cannot be now justified by those who promoted terrosrism for deacdes. The guerilla terrorists massacred thousands and thousands of innocent civilian vilages, hacked to death children.  Shot monks in temples, bombed monks travelling in busses for daceds in north and east.  The trrorists even blew up the southern cities like colombo where all comminities lived in harmony, thousands of innocent ppl killed by the seperatists.  Innocent children going to primary schools, poor workers travelingto work were bombed in the main city of Colombo (Maradana, Fort etc etc ) by these same people who ask for justice now. How can that be?? Is there any accountability for such atrocities by those who committed ? No. No one even speaks of such.  Ultimately,  the truth is Both sides suffred.  That's a result anticipated by certain outside elements.  Geopoliticts!  They always assisted the side getting defeated. Thats to maintain a conflict,  to thier benefit.  Our own youth of the same mother suffered.  BUT ANYHOW, now its NOT THE TIME TO THROW ACCUSATIONS at each other,  it the time for all of us to learn a lesson from past,  and move forward peacefully as one brotherhood, one nation.  The lesson must be learnt that the future of our children is far more important than different personal Agenda of different geographical powers, cunning political strategy of politicians in western countries, media that scavenge on the healing wounds of a poor nation and NGOs surviving on sponsorships.  We have forgiven everyone who were on the separatist terrorist side for all their atrocities. Lets be wise and start a fresh,  for the sake of our future generations. Tamils and sinahalese are the two sons of the same mother. If these two segments are wise enough to understand this undeniable truth, that our genetical identity is closer than any other,  and fully unite as one with intelligence, such united front fill conquer the world through wisdom and strength.  Thats a fact!  The world knows it, those who feed on this past issue for their present day survival know it, and thats why hatred is still sponsored and promoted even today! Wounds are to allowed to heal rather than poking fingers on it like Al Jazeera does!
Immensely satisfied as a Sri Lankan after watching this interview!
Attorney General appointed by President
He Mr. Wickramasinghe looks very GUILTY
In Parliament, they all agreed to make him the President because they needed to survive in Parliament, as they were enjoying all the privileges. Ranil, the mastermind, was the one who could manage it at the time. It was all corrupt. The Rajapaksas and others elected to Parliament had one primary goal—to make themselves rich. That is what everyone elected to Parliament is doing. Their main goal is not to serve the public; public service is merely a cover-up. That is the dark truth of Sri Lankan politics. People can still survive, but if these corruptions had not taken place, Sri Lanka would be a great country by now. We need to update the constitution by cutting down the privileges of Parliament members.    People can't prove these corruptions because all government institutions are in their hands. There is not much evidence to prove them because they know how to cover everything up. 35:29
DEAR. AL. JASERA.  PRESIDENT. RANIL.  BIG.  LIEYER.  HE.  KNOW.  WHO. BEHINND...THIS...PAASKU..ATTACK. NO. DOUT. RAJAPAKSHA.  BEHIND.  THIS.  ATTACK...THIS. GUY. KILLER. ONLY. HIS. INTENTION.  POWER.  BY. HOOCK. OR. CROCK.
You can hate RW, but you can't call this journalism when he is not even letting him finish his answers.
A real predicament for Ranil... Yes this is the kind of questioning that should be used when corrupt politicians are interviewed...
This Medi guy is not a real journalist, as he does always with all the geusts, when the guest answers the question completely and trusthfully he changes the subject. it is quit rude not very professional1 Medi=Trump. ALL ALEGATIONS (USA; BBC; EU; UN) BUT NO EVIDENCE!!!! ha...ha... Al Jazeera and their journos are FAKE!!!
The basic is there is no justice for Tamil genoside because it’s against singala soldiers and politicians interests
Mate, this man here did nothing for the country all these years he is proudly saying he's been in politics for. Propaganda and scamming the innocent people with false promises, "mere puffery," they call it, is all he did. If he thinks he saved the country going into bankruptcy by defaulting the repayments and that's a strategy, I've made my point. I did see someone giving him credit for saving the country from the brink of economic collapse by using the above strategy; I mean, what else could have happened in the short term?!? The long-term repercussions were diabolical. These clowns think the joke is on the citizens. Absolute fraudsters, the whole bunch of them, including his "masters," he was broking for!
Ranil wickramasinghe has to be aressted.he is just acting as a joke for all these happenings.
Ranil brought stability to an economically wrecked country. Even now, we keep to his policies to ensure that there isn't a mass blackout again. That is enough for me to respect him. Was he draconian in his efforts? Yes, but so are 99% of leaders in South Asia. However, Ranil as PM and head of state was democratic enough to uphold freedom of speech and of the press. The biggest mistake one can make is to compare Western democracy with that of Sri Lanka, given that our culture is one that condones heavy-handed measures and strongman leadership.
When asked about Batalanda commission report, the only childish answer he could muster was "there is no report"😂 Just because it was not tabled in Parliment (because the then president Chandrika Bandaranayake only used the commission report as a tool to keep Ranil silent in the upcoming election) does not mean that "there is no report". As utterly ridiculous as it sounds, these are the antics that this man uses in local politics to dismiss factual allegations and accusations  filed against him. Astonishingly, he has got away with it, so far, without any judicial punishment. 🤷‍♂️
@32:15
Respect to the journalist/host for being straight to the point and doing all the homework to collect the vital information to ditch this rotten man
What relevance if you been in politics before the journalist was conceived, you are behaviour is like a spoilt brat.
Thank you Al Jazeera for the interview, what a insight, bravery and constructive questioning , uncovering hidden truth, and as usual culprit and suspect Rajapasha clan and Ranil who abused and looted the lanka over 30 years. Nothing is forgotten nothing is ever forgotten 🤘🇱🇰 මාතෘ භූමියට ජය
HE WAS THE MERDERER OF BATALANDA...
It seems like he had two magic answers to coverup anything. 1. appointing a committee 2. get the parliament approval 😂
Ex President failed to answer perfactly
Dear Al Jafeera. FYI. The guy (RW) who was interviewed says that you have dubbed cut and chopped the interview and have made it short. Please kindly make a statement saying that was the original of the interview. He is …. No words express.
They themselves are to blame. Now there own people fled the land with the money 😂😂😂  Karma is what it is. All the civilians, young childrens 😞  Now you see  Love is God
There is tow comedians one is RANIL  other one NIRAJDEVA. 😂 I think this is a ranil last interview ever😅 F**** FOX 🦊
THIS IS HOW THE JOUNALISM SHOULD AND MUST WORK IN THE WORLD. AFTER WATCHING THIS PROGRAMME, PARTISAN SRI LANKAN JOUNALISTS CAN LEARN AND REFLECT ON HOW THEY SHOULD DO THIER JOB.
Thank you... Al Jazeera... 💖
😮
Mehdi retire pls before you become a shame to your family..what a cheap journalist...No wonder you got kicked out from MSNBC ..The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment and shear hatred on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the preplanned smearing plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...What a waste of money they were surely thinking...hahaha what sore losers😝😝 these tamil rascist terrorist diaspora has become more and more pathetic with their own fantasized theories  even after 15 since defeat at mullivaikal...they will soon rot in their own hate along with that rascist white witch of a journalist 😂😂😂😂what a treat to watch these miserable people rotting in their own rascism and hatred🎉
Shame on you Ranil ! He try’s again to come back to Politics! His political story begins in 1970‘s and we have now 2025 !
Some of the parallels of what happened in the last phase of the war and how the Israelis had adopted the same strategy in gaza is very surprising. If Sri lanka is prosecuted then so should Israel,  If isreal is not prosecuted as it is still ongoing and on a much larger scale then the west has no feet to stand up and is a systematic failure of international law.
Unprofessional journalism
Ranil is unable to respond to those inquiries due to his prior support for Rajapaksa, indicating that he is also implicated in the current crisis.
This journalist is an ARROGANT NARCISSIST! 😅 he is so ignorant of the ground scenario and the chaos funded by USAID./ GEORGE SOROS in SL.
Wow  as a srilankan im very happy this  interview  thank you  al jasira 👍👍🌷🌷❣️❣️🙏🙏🙏🙏
he answered liker a 3rd class person, and can see the guilt. need to send this guy to jail. Hat off for all journalists who have asked question with evidence.
Sri lanka also need a reporter like Mehdi
Feels good to see this nursing home aged scumbag exposed. Puppet for the Rajapakshas. It's a shame that we have to go out of our country to get a proper interviewer to let corrupt government officials face their own lies. Ranil probably wished for once he did not know English. Got exposed bad.
RW-"Dont loose your temper" , he is verbalising his behaviour.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SL IS CRAZED!! The Cardinal is a nut job!! This journalist obviously has no idea how CORRUPT the Cardinal is ... 😅
Npp good government in Sri Lanka
රනිල්ට රැවිලා😂
Most waited moment. Hats off journalist
100000+ Aura journalist
යුද්ද වෙලාවෙ රට පැන්න කොටි ගෙනල්ලා audience 1 පුරවලා රනිලා අමාරුවෙ දාද්දි අපේ උන්ට හෙන journalism. මේකා හොරා තක්කඩියා තමයි ඒත් ප්රශ්නෙට උත්තරයක් ෙදන්න ඉඩ දෙන්නෙ නැ ප්රශ්නෙ අහන ඒකා
Imagine getting owned this hard by Mehdi Hasan of all people.
Interviewer is an utter pro terrorist man who trying to push agendas 😂😂😂 and the audience is full of ltte supporters 😂😂😂
Ranil is  a  FAKE  ,  What a JOKE he  is
Can you ask to come next Anura Dissanaye..😂
Most idiotiic President of Sri Lanka🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
"For the first time, Ranil met a real journalist" 2
Liar nothing but laies.
He is the epitome of Sri Lankan politicians, telling nothing but lies.
Sri Lanka is being currupted country since  1977 .Ranil is a majour caractor of that era.Nothing else more words... I'm a Sri lankan.
He is a mentally  cheater never answer any qustion just make others fools got deal from rajapaksa 😢😢😢
22:20 speechless 😶😅
He tries to fool  every journalist through his Mr. Been behavior, this didn't workout with world class journalist Mehdi.
Thank you, Jazeera.
Well done Al Jazeera and head to head team for leaving The Dangerous fox of Sri Lanka alike an old rooster in a suit.
Well this is embarrassing does this silly former PM not realise that the audience are laughing at him? Utterly despicable man
What a masterclass in journalism interrupting, badgering, and pushing an agenda instead of actually listening. Must be tough juggling that earpiece full of pre scripted attack. Bravo, truly award winning theater…!  When did Mehdi start following footsteps of Piers Morgan….? 🤔 At least this interview will unite the LTTE sympathisers and brain dead jeppos. But Sure these clips will satisfy the dead beat jeppos premature ejac……👍
I think Ranil playing with country 70 years  1983 2002 2009 2019 2022  All problems created by Ranil Wikkeramasinga😢😢
Oh. What a child 😂
Mahdhi hasan has to interweave all rajabakshas
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? 😝😝😝😝 RW and his political future (if he had at least a slim chance) it was f….ek on international media.
This is the line of questioning we need in srilanka! 🇱🇰  Hats off to Al-Jazeera! 🫡
The real journalism ❤
Why can't you take Mahinda Rajapakshe for an interview?
Ask how many useless committees he  appointed and wasetered the country's money
When it comes to Easter attack and his support to Rajapaksha's i agree with Al Jazeers but with terrorist LTTE I am against Al Jazeera going with terrorist.   LTTE TERRORIST = Al Qauida = ISIS.  Wars are bad when fighting with terrorist and that happens with US,UK ,INDIA AND EVEN SRI LANKA
Respect journalist❤
My bro in law massacred and killed in Kalubowila hospital by dangerous mobs who were free to walk into the hospital in 1983 the black days....the Gov never used the Army or Police to stop the killing for 3 horrible days.. A motherland that didn't give our own Army to protect us is worthless😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I am not trying to defend Ranil but Mehdi is just yelling at him. The reports are all fake and all politicians in SL are thieves. As Ranil said the Sri Lankan churches are also corrupt and they have their own bad politics.
Sad   story
What a case study👍
This is what Bulgarian attributed mystic "Baba Vanga" said few decades ago,  "If Al Jazeera Head office in Colombo, and Mehdi Hasan lives in Sri lanka. Those Disappeared persons total will incrase by +1, and Mehdi's family will be fighting for justice with his photo for another 100 years"  God saved Al Jazeera, Amen !

If the sri lankan journalists had the courage and brain like this gentlemen, normal people would have known the tragedy that politicians made so far.
Ranil is a Psychopath
Trump in a parallel universe
Dear Al Jazeera, please stop inviting political hitchhikers they’re just thumbing a ride on every debate.
Fantastic work
Need to applaud the audience comment "Muppets lead by a joker". As you can see throughout the interview the maturity of a former president. 😢😢
I completely agree with Ranil and Rajapaksa about the other destructions they have done to this country. When you mention Batalanda, Ranil has nothing to talk about. At that time, JR Jayewardene in politics asked Ranil to stop the JVP. Ranil and Rajapaksa cannot be free from that. Above all, karma is coming after them...
He didn’t even have the curtesy to acknowledge to that survivor or say sorry for being the victim speaks about it all!! 😡
Thank you, Aljazeera, Hats off!!!
27:17 This is how the world looks at Sri Lanka A hand with blood stain and still think that hand is savior of innocent
Haraame Lanka ranil rajapaksha

We want mahinda version
Mehdi, politicians worst enemy
Ranil is a fox, killer
He's a Good president to our country. I'm From Srilankan ❤️
surely he know more and engaged in that crimes but 26:24 "no contest" WTF is that answer🤨
Time to retire and go home RW we no longer need you
Good lesson for our Journalists. Lot to learn from Al Jazeera 😂
Going around the world thinking he is the best.. Ranil got the message how world thinking about it….Kama
This Ranil ....is not a Buddhist, this guy pretends  Buddhist but his generation s are Christians / Catholics. Forget about his religious background, this cri.....l killed countless number of Sinhalese youths of former REAL JVP, NOT CURRENT DAY CIA JVPs of Anura guy another cheater in Ranil's torture house in Batalanda of Ranil's own constitution of Kelaniya. Is he a Buddhist who tortured & killed youths, Ranil or any governmental ras.....l can't take law into their hands, its up to the courts to punish those youths. ....
The audience is 100% Tamil? Al Jazeera has the liberty to pick on their choice. But if there going to be any change triggered through this interview ( if at all) that’s the majority Sinhalese who prefer Al Jazeera over other western news channels just giving it up despite the political view they have and how badly they hate RW.
Respect ! Al Jazeera ❤
A useless and unwanted war that brought the country into it knee. Almost 30 years dragged that war but for what ??? For languages, culture and land rights. Those nationalist destroyed the country. Tamil were marginalised by then goverment bandaranayaka. Bandaranayaka who ochestrated the tamil issue in sri lanka
Ranil,sheme🤮🤮🤮destroyer of sri lanka.
Grandpa in trouble
That’s totally wrong, The Sri Lankan army never attacked hospitals housing Tamil civilians. The Tamil Tigers eventually attacked government forces using mortars from hospitals. It was the Sri Lankan government forces, not the Tamil Tigers, who liberated Tamils ​​from the DFZ. Please correct this.
Bravo Mehdi .. you are spot on RW is big part of the problem in Sri Lanka  !
Ranil is a slippery fish among the fish being washed. But 'Al Jazeera' is a powerful media that catches even slippery fish. May your good media service continue.

Sri Lanka ranks among the top 15 countries in IQ, but I think they forgot to include politicians in the test.
Ranil exposed!!¡
Wickramasinghe often asks, "Where is the evidence?" and "Why didn't Parliament take any action on the Batalanda Commission report?" However, after his party lost the election, the new government was led by his friend, Chandrika Kumaratunga. She won the election by promising the Sri Lankan people that she would take action against these criminals. Yet, after coming to power, she did nothing.    People must realize that Sri Lanka has been ruled by the same few families for 75 years, and they protect each other when necessary. During Wickramasinghe’s government, the war escalated, beginning with the burning of the Jaffna Public Library and the Black July riots. His administration was responsible for immense suffering, leading to a 30-year war. It was not only Tamil people who were killed his government also massacred 60,000 Sinhalese people between 1989 and 1990.
The gentleman in the blue suit was brilliant . Kudos to him for standing up against the rubbish accusations of the govt against a terrorist organisation .
For those who keep praising him saying this is journalism... No this is activism! A journalist would allow the interviewee to answer the question not keep jumbling words until the crowd accepts his word! Seems like separatists are not done yet about Sri Lanka!
wow  very  biased interview
Ranil is a born bluffer
Ranil, this isn’t Palki Sharma, who arrived just days before the presidential election, violated pre-election media regulations, and attempted to influence the campaign in India’s favor.

Resign from the leadership  of UNP, now damage done by  you and Rajapakses is enough.

It would be better if you had a discussion with Mr. Bean.
He never answers the questions asked , he beats about the bush….
Killer of batalanda
Al Jazeera forgot to ask  about Jaffna library burnt by him.🥹😤
Ranil, you are an opportunist  and a bullshitter
Well done interviewer ❤❤❤
Ranil criminal man 😡😡😡
RIP
Wow next time ask why he has English name as well during British era in SL..? Time to time many people use in western world use that names for benefit 😘
QUALITY JUDGEMENT
It was clear that "Al Jazeera" was trying to smear Ranil with the Tiger diaspora. Ranil, as usual, cunningly saved his people. If Sri Lamka's present leaders like Bimal Ratnayake, Anura Kumara... had faced a situation like that, what would have happened, "those who watched Al Jazeera thought.

Mehdi, thank you
Ranil Wickramasinghe doesn't care about killing 60,000 people. He only cares about preserving his power.😢
Checkmated😅
READ THIS PLEASE EVEN IF YOU ARE TAMIL OR SINHALESE DOES NOT MATTER. You are a Sri Lankan.  Tigers killed and did suicide squads all around country. This has nothing to do with Tamil people.   Any person who is a “Sri lankan” SHOULD BE ABLE TO become president and execute the law and order without ANY single bias facts, that’s when Sri Lanka will win. Praba is the biggest mind master  in the game, he wanted to be king in his own comfort, manipulation, everything else took place. THINK. The guy is Pablo escobar part 2.   These old people I mean, even the guy who stood up and asked for a part of the country, he is a jackal and a puppet himself, working for terror organization.  Just find out why LTTE prabakran lost people standing up his side anymore. Suicide squads Bombing Very gruesome things happened. Not saying SL army is 100% clean for sure rajapakshas are not too. But we all got to GOT TO agree and oppose to this mind game separating you and me as a tamilian or a Sinhalese, let’s focus on more science, education and growth in the world and the universe instead these all expired failed products of LTTE or SL government made already. You are a Sri Lankan. Look Japan doesn’t have these sorts of very controversial issues, that’s why they are soo going ahead no one of us can reach there, because we are very immature. ❤️
What a child lmao
Thanks God that namely president Ranil (not elected by public) met the right journalist in his life. As Sri Lankan I feel so bad about Ranil (not elected by people)
Smh
Ralin destroyed our elder generation for their own political agendas. That’s only one true. Still no justice and the are still free. Ranil is a murderer.  But they will never expect Sri Lanka political will changed to like this. Now we are working hard for our country. Any ranil, rajapaksha and their crew will be punished with law.  Sri Lankan young generation
Ranil is a very  ruthless leader ever we had in Srilanka. Just see the way  Ranil's behavior so snobbish
This is so satisfying 🤣 I’m a Sri Lankan and I haven’t seen this type of interview in Sri Lanka
I never liked Hasan, but now I get it you're a much needed soul in journalism who managed to put this spoiled brat in his place. Bravo!
This is a very abusive interview
Ranil is respected through out the world. He got SL out of dire crisis at that moment. Now let's wait and  see....when power cuts, inflation, lack of basic  commodities (already rice issue) hit the roof again..... Let's see how the so young generation overcome those, with their so young and beautiful new government....
Respect Al Jaseera Respect  Journalist  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This may be the first time for Ranil Rajapakshe who met a really journalist 😂😂😂😂😂.
The lady talking about genocide, I’m not Agree because they don’t know what Tamil Tiger did. Talking about silver they killed.(LTTE) hundred thousand people include Tamil civilian. except that other part of this discussion we Will agreed because Rajapaksha bankrupt this country
I love peace... I hate crimes and wars... If crimes happen in general soceity, then in wars crimes will happen more than that.. If justice happen for the crimes in general society, then in wars justice happen less than that... Powerful countries will question from weaks about their war crimes But no country will question their own war crimes either it is a powerful or weak
Really enjoyed this. 😂
Ranil paw bang 😅
This journalist lost his temper. He tried his best pinned everything on Rajapaksha and Sri Lankan army and failed miserably. Thousands of Sinhalese were killed by Tamil terrorist. No one talked about those atrocities. JVP terrorists looted killed and destroy the whole country. Ranil flawlessly answered he questions. He lost his temper little bit and I agree on it. If this guy interview Donald Trump he will learn a lesson about good manners. Hail Ranil 🥰🥰
You get full support from us Sri Lankan. we are so glad that people are stepping him down. Ranil and Rajapaksa never took and never will take accountability. We badly need more people expanding our voices out in the world cuz everything happening in this country gets shut down and hidden away. We badly need justice for a better country and that start by having those who had many killed and put to poverity held accountable.
God job Al Jazeera ❤💯👍🇱🇰
He is a murderer and a crook. Killed people and robbed the country to stay in power with his gang of politicians for decades. He should be put in jail for life, for his crimes.
Thank you very much forever Mr;MEHDI HASAN
Dear Al Jazeera, please upload full video without any corrections...
You should be deserved! Congratulations- interviewer  Hat's off!👍
Okay we all know people had their past and things happened in back of the days.  But this looks so much of a Tamil diaspora backed agenda asking questions from Ranil who was in opposition party during war period.  Also there wasn't any media ethics followed or respect maintained for a former president of a nation. The entire crowd is full of Tamil people who's only motive is to corner Ranil and mock him. Only 1 person spoke with sense who asked to bring Rajapaksha to the show and ask these questions.  This is utter nonsense which has no motive to get answers but only motives on mocking.
Mr. Bean,taken to the cleaners by Mehdi. Imagine what would happen to the interviewer if he were Sri Lankan—possibly, the police might find his body on Galle Face Beach the next morning. 😂😂😂 BTW, this interview should definitely be translated into Sinhala and broadcast on every channel in Sri Lanka.
All jourlust are bunch of jokers.,and not fair to attack ozone person,who had good job to reestablished Sri Lankan economy...
ලොවෙත් නැති වෙන්න නෑවා නේද.🤕
This interview makes me so happy. Good job Mahdi❤
கூட்டு களவாளிகள் தான் கடந்த 70 வருடங்களாக இலங்கையை சூறையாடினார்கள்.
He is a failed politician, it is a shame that he still want to be in politics.  yes, he runs around freely, facing Interviews, hoping to show himself as a smart guy because in Sri Lanka there is no accountability for all kind of crimes😢😢
Please invite the Rajapaksas as well. No journalist in Sri Lanka can speak against them like this. If someone does, they go missing or are killed, and no evidence remains.
Ranil is guilty of all what had happen in sri lanka during his teniure. Runil should be punish because failiour to do his duty. He is trying to skip the question. Ranil is power hungry person and brutal ruler
Bro thought this was talk with chathura😂😂😂
Don't think this is a full interview. Please post the whole interview. Clear manipulation by Al Jazeera to eco the opinion of LTTE Diaspora
I dont like ranil but this not an interview,this guy just says bunch of stuff and wont let that guy answer😅
Mehedy hassan u did it really well. finally vigilante met real one
Tigers killed so much innocent civilians in Sri Lanka
Rubbish answers we can guess his political carrier. He thinks he is a supreme politician, but nothing is done to Sri Lanka.
The Holy Bible quote in Proverbs that essentially says to "respond stupidly to a stupid question" is Proverbs 26:5 which states,   "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.".
Idiot Ranil rajapaksa
Thank u Al jazera.
Ranil should have known about the limited time constraints that the show, by its nature had, and seen that bluffing is a sure no go!
I am so happy that Hasan's professionalism revealed Ranil's real face to the world.
A slam dunk of a humiliating interview. RW however is impervious to shame as indeed those of his ilk are. Well done MH.
Ranil vikramasingha real name is in Sri Lanka fox .
Why did you change the DP referring to war crimes?
Thankyou Mehdi for grilling this clown. Ranil Rajapaksha. Look at Ranil, powerless, cornered like a rat and yelling to get out of it😂😂. Amazing stuff
Omg Ferrari is heavy damage!! politics fox is revealing his real face .
Best interview for 2025
Second hand embarrassment 😅 Seeya nala
You should know under his leadership there were more than 60,000 young people were killed and he conducted the torture houses in Sri Lanka
Ranil thinks he is an omniscient person. He thinks he is smarter than anybody. This is the first time in my life, I have seen Ranil getting roasted. He finally got what he deserves. Uneducated Sri Lankan Media won't have the courage to question him like this!
මේක ලංකාවේ පෙන්නන්න ඕන සිංහලෙන් හඩකවලම​!. Ranil’s first meeting with a real journalist was an eye-opener for those who called him the Brain of Asia. 😜
In 35.39 minutes of this interview ranil wickramasinghe show how professional he is......
රෙනීල්............
Mahi - Run Away 😂
Good lord thank goodness he’s not the president anymore.
Well done president Ranil ❤
Thank you al jazeera for exposing these jokers
Not a Fan of Ranil. but I would say Ranil faced the Interview Great. It is nothing but a Diaspora script. Fans of current Govenment are so Happy , yet their government with 2/3 of power in hand doing nothing new other than show.Becouse most of the accusations were made with no facts. 😅
Cunning politician of this part of the world. The way he avoided answering  The questions. He has not been able  To win a single election In his political  Career although he became president once not through people verdict .what sad is that politians of this part of the  World speak lot of lies as you all can see the in this interview he won't accept the facts but he keeps on denying his wrong doing.  Anyway we have good government in  Position after couple of decades and hope good will happen to our motherland .inshaallah
This interview is highly valued by me, as a Sri Lankan citizen. While a persistent myth exists among a minority regarding Ranil's aptitude for governance, his exposure in Sri Lanka has been primarily limited to controlled media appearances. Therefore, this opportunity to observe Ranil's true nature is particularly welcome.
Can u invité  nantha sanaa rajapiska brother s company.
Respect journalist ❤
I think this is the first interview that a Sri Lankan politician has participated in and would be the last. No one has the guts to sit face to face with this journalist for a tough interview except Ranil Wickramasinghe.
Edited????🇱🇰
Thank you Al-Jazeera revealing true nature of this criminal man
Journalist - ''With respect, 700 people died, so it's not that funny'' sums it all up.
Ranil : U gonna do what abt it ?  😂😂 ( sri lankan politics = joke ) its a fkin game
Batalanda is hidden truth of Ranil Wickramasihgha ,
20:23 Mr bean 😂💔
Interview mahinda rajapaksa also
I'm sorry but this is not the way to conduct interviews, specially with Senior Political leaders like Ranil W. Interview is based on allegations...not on a factual basis...We can't bring down Sri Lanka in this manner.
Ranil!! India warned you about the easter attack, but you and Srisena were neglected.
Please let me know that where is the GOMA
Bank robber
🙏🙏🙏
39:22  ✅
You don't have money for a elections. But you could go flying over any country spending borrowd money.
No one is talking about the people who killed by the Tamil Tigers as well…
You are a real journalist to crackdown a stubborn egoistic idiot down
I’m a Sri Lankan, and I’m deeply saddened by this. It’s shameful that he still gets a platform to speak after destroying our future. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Ranil being so funny! Hats off to the interviewer… even a person like me not understanding politics much has got it! Weldone
චමුදිත සමග සත්‍යය කියන ප්‍රෝග්‍රෑම් එක කියලා හිතන් ඉන්නෙ.
Even though I'm not with Rajapakshas, but they did what had t be done. The LTTE had to be finished. They started this war in 1983. They killed many army personnels with no real reason and asked Sri Lankan government to respond it. But, what happened in civil society in that era was wrong.
7:50 This man is lying. If he avoided corruptions of his government & unnecessary expenditures after he appointed as the president in 2022,  elections could been held for several times. Further, Supreme Court ordered to hold election but as the Fnance Minister, he violated Supreme Court order by saying government has no money even though funds allocated in the budget 2023 and got away because the immunity he got as the president.
Just a pathetic host. Have the decency to allow your guest to speak
Make an interview with the India prime minister modi also.
WHY DON'T YOU SAY WHY PROHIBITED POSPHROUS GAS  BOMBS WAS USED  2009 WAR KILLED MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE BODIES BURNED TO DEATH??
Ranil is a narcissistic sadistic immoral person And people of the world can now see who he is actually nothing like anything he's been told before acting like a child in an interview he's not smart nor he's not answering he's not democratic as he's showing he's a dictator just like his uncle JR the world seen who he is after he's been elected as president by the parliament
His house was burned on his purpose. It was not attacked by civilians. Also his every books and stuff moved using the army soldiers which was forced by Rajapaksha. There was no harm done by civilians. It was his master plan show 😂
රාජපක්ෂලාව ආරක්ෂා කරේ නැත්නම් මෙයාට අපිත් ආයෙත් බලය දෙන්න තිබ්බා
YES YES For the first time, Ranil met a real journalist
This interview should be played in psychiatry and psychology classes as a classic case study of a psychopath.
Dear Mehedi....I backed you when you confront with western media ......and thought you are talking facts......this proves that we should trust this western media than you....this is real filth......
👍👍👍
THERR IS NO WAY SRI LANKA GOVERNMENT WILL  SETTLED TAMIL'S RIGHTS. STILL MANY WAYS GENOCIDE HAPPENING LIKE LOOTING PEOPLE LAND'S AND BUILDING VIHARAI WITH ARMIES HELP HOOK OR CROOK.  P.EOPLE CAN'T EVEN DO PRAYERS AT HISTORICAL PLACE VEDUKUNARII MOUNTAIN LORD SIVA TEMPLE.
He tried to ride it off with silly smile and mocking the interviewer. Got owned I would say.
The power-hungry dead ghost
ලංකාවම ඉවර කරා.
39:23  I stand with him at this point. He is right. Palastine is a well recognized state. Who distinguished a Tamil state here in Sri Lanka?
He is.the batalanda killer basted
Terrible journalism. He was so rude
God will save Srilanka
Ranil got busted by the AL Jazeer not by the police of Sri Lanka. As a Sri Lankan I give my full respect to this journalist. 👍
Very sad state of affairs Mr. Wickramasinghe. No doubt,it's highlighted that you have avoided questions, thinking you are smart. Finally you proved the world that you are snobbish and swallow Headed.
Beautiful!
Hot questions❤
Idiot. He first tried to convince since it failed, and then he confused.
Family tiger 🐅
Best interview I’ve seen in my life thank you Mehdi Hassan
Great to see Ranil grilled in this manner.  Deserving.  Worth noting though - one of the commenters in the audience is the daughter of a terrorist leader (LTTE). So while the grilling here is totally justified, there's a hint of terrorism sympathing behind this event.  Not that it matters, the LTTE terrorist group and their murderous purpose no longer exists. But worth noticing.
Mr Mahdi Hassan ❤️‍🔥❤️💯 amazing job. Well done. Contrarily ranils body language clearly showed today how guilty he is for batalanda and other crimes of his time and mahindas. Ranil / mahinda combination plus the past 70 years of corrupt governments and politicians are solely responsible for the srilankas downfall. Happy to elect our new president Mr Anura Kumara and his NPP government to bring back srilanka to its glory and bring justice to our nation. Looking forward to a corruption and debt free country ❤️🇱🇰🧭
Please don't call him for international interviews he is such a corrupt person.
Ranil got the chance to  prove to  the  world  what  atrocities he  can  commit  against  innocent  civilians  to remain in  power.
please someone tag derana or hiru
In Jesus Mighty Name Amen, Salam Alaikum, wa Alaikum Salaam,,,,
The cause and foundation of the world biggest problem is Italy and France Paris, Torino, Taranto, Sardegna, Napolitano, Napoli, America, Rome,,
I am not a fan of Mr Wircramasinhe. I am a Sri Lankan and this was first time I watched this programme, since one of the Sri Lankan president been interviewed. But this presenter behaves and make decision like drunken mad king. How would any one make decision about he like EU or not in one sentence. That will be days of investigation and interviews before deciding he like EU or not. How can politicians throw way committee findings?  I agree with President passing the questions.
Now all Sri Lankans know that he was only a great pretender and not all an intelligent politician. Fell so sorry for him.
Ranil was Lying always and he was not try to jump out in the Sri Lankan economy crisis he is never looked for the srilankan peoples As far was I can see Ranil is a joker Please help us to drive out bad politicians in Srilanka As a Sri Lankan,I’m very much satisfied with this interview. 😍
Well done Al Jazeera, thanks
Ranil Wickramasinghe 🇱🇰❤
If rowan atkinson want to retire now it's the time! Brits got a new bean!
Habibi Medi got cooked by RW😂
Wonderful interview, never in the history this is been done. Ranil was drilled, he couldn’t hide his face. Well done Mr Mehdi. We are so thankful that things were exposed at this interview
As a sri lankan pleased to see this cunning man with such emberrasment. Lifetime played political games and still.thank you al jaseera❤
Ranil is not a good politician ( Greedy man )
රනිල් හිනා වෙවී ඉන්නෙ මං මොනවත් කරපු දෙයක් නැති ගානට රට කඩාවැටෙන්න..😮
Ranil vickramasingha's attitudes like 1920's old village man answers for the jenz people's questions...  he doesn't have meaningful answers to even avoid the questions also.. shame on him..
Those who know about Ranil Wickramasinghe’s actions know that he and the government led by President JR Jayawardhana sold the Sapugaskanda Urea Fertilizer Factory, the second largest investment in Sri Lanka at the time, for the price of scrap metal, and forcibly took over the luxury housing complex built for the factory in Batalanda and built a tor ture camp there. More than 3,000 innocent young men and women were bru tal ly mu rd ered in that camp. When he is asked about that incident, he laughs. Because he knows that it is all true, that he did it. And he also knows that since he destroyed all the evidence related to it, he cannot be directly prosecuted. Thank you Mr. Mehdi Hasan & Al Jazeera for this interview.
Wasted
lier ...white lie....born to lie..what more evidence we need ... he himself proved what a idiot he is.
Aljazeera must be happy with the money that was paid by the same people who funded a brutal terrorist organization who killed their own people for a savage political cause.
RW is the best❤️
For the very first time Ranil met a real journalist ❤❤❤❤
Ranil rajapakshe is a bad luck of Srilanka.
It's a shame to remember that sri lanka doesn't have journalists with a backbone.
Appaya Lanka
Very good 👍
😂
Supper 💯💯💯😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So bored
අධි සංවේඩ්ගී බයියො චූන් වෙලා
We don't like ranil and rajapaksha (from sri lanka )we need AKD only
Ranil pretended that he was a genius and a know all person in Sri Lanka. He and most of the Sri Lankan stoogers only knew he was an A grade joker in front of international journalists. He was so childish and a Hero became a Zero.
The house of ranil was burnt by him self to victimize his self and put the blame on protestors.Can you imagine how we survive these politicians in srilanka.They are experts in ignorance and thefts.Gotabhaya had a special navy crew to kidnap innocent tamil boys and blackmailed their innocent parents.Those old parents still seeking for their children.Ranil and mahinda are protecting each others careers because both of them knows each others crimes.
Noooooo nooooo😂 අනේ පප්පා
Ferrari Licence Holder 😂😂 Ranil 😂😂😂
Some journalist in sri lanka like interview with ranil wickramasinghe and  questions as you.But he not face that.  You are the man hasan . Respect you 👏  You were questions are the  thousand of sri lankans questions  well known about ranil wickramasinghe.
That guy Nirj Deva was asking questions until the break and somehow became supportive to the former president!
I have been a politician before you born 😂😂😂😂 mokka Ranil 😂😂
The best interview I have ever seen and satisfied ❤ Thank you Mr. ( From Sri Lanka)
Honestly, I feel like Ranil is one of the worst politicians in Sri Lanka. But what really bothers me is why everyone keeps bringing up the war in the North as if it didn’t affect others too. Back then, terrorists took the lives of our friends, our children so many innocent people. And if we really look at it, it all started because of power-hungry politicians who played their games without thinking about the consequences. Things spiraled out of control, and that’s how the war escalated. In the end, they’re the ones responsible. But today, Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities are living together in peace. Yet, these same politicians still try to divide us just to secure their votes. It’s frustrating to see history being used for their personal gain.
Should’ve asked “so why are you gay?”
This interview is organized and funded by the terrorists of LTTE
Srilankan fox politician Ranil
Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 independent country  on need out side peoples touch Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
Thank u for doing this interview ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Ranil is such a horrible man!!
well done Mr. Mahdi still this old fox will blame Al Jazeera saying that this was a set up after all he's a dirty old fox
This journalist don’t have a discipline
Cunning Ranil😂😂😂
Excellent journalism 😂😂
Why our comment are you deleting?
Hats off to the journalist . Love from srilanka ❤
Sri Lanka  🇱🇰  independent country no need out side peoples touch the Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 journalist don’t have discipline  🪫
Thank u Al jazeera. U guys did a great job. Much needed interveiw as Sri lankan.❤️
This interviewer is same as Chamuditha. He doesn't give a chance to talk.
Okay, the first half of this interview felt like valid questions and factual debate. But toward the end, it took a complete 180, trying to portray the LTTE as saints while painting the government who were protecting the country’s people as the villains. For the record, I’m no Ranil fan, but by the end, it felt like they were pushing an agenda. The so called UK folks judging us are the same ones who colonized our country, killed countless people, and robbed us from 1815 to 1948. They’ve got no right to act all high and mighty. The audience was clearly there to prop up the LTTE as saints while attacking and questioning Ranil. ලංකාවෙ යාලුවන්ට කියන්න තියෙන්න ජොලි සීයට හිනා වෙනවා වගේම මුන්ගෙ Agenda වලටත් අහුවෙන්න එපා. මේක Full එකම බැලුවම තමයි මටත් මේක තේරුනේ. 😹
Imagine,if Anura dissanayake was here?😂
We want one more interview from the Rajapakshas!!
Rani was a selected president by rajapaksa,s regime. Last 2 years he had to  respect them for the selecting him as the president. He will never get an elected president in 🇱🇰 . This interview should go in local TV in sinhala to understand our national peoples . ❤❤❤
I am a Sri Lankan and this is the real journalism and this clown nearly cried and became a laughing stock 😅
Well done interviewer 👏👏👏
As a native srilankan this is the first time any srilakan politician got roasted by real journalist  Hats off
Sri Lanka is independent nation the Tamil come from south India to my mother land for working in tea garden colonial time  ( British ) so we hosting them so I hope in future they can hold our hand walk together as a one big family  welcoming  This is a Sri Lanka our country.   I would really like to have another conversation like this about  victimize Sri Lanken boys, Sri Lanken innocent people kill by Tamil people LTTE My brother killed by LTTE terrorist  Tharuwanasaranai
This guy Ranil Wickramasinghe is a thug in Sri Lanka. He ignored , insulted almost every single Sri lankan throughout his political career. Glad he got exposed like this.
Who funded  this program LTTE terrorist ??
Thank you Al Jazeera❤Mehdir Hassen
He couldn’t hide abt helping gota. When will gota be brought to justice
Mr Ranil (Batalantha) escaping from the question 😂
Ranil leaves with wet pants😂.
Excellent 👌🫡
2029 😈
Stupid journalist and a stupid question.  We are Sri Lankans. 🇱🇰 Come and experience who we are, what we can do here and what we do here in this blessed Island Nation
We need like this journalist in Sri Lanka ❤️
Wow hats off.. Aljazeera ❤ - Respect from Sri Lanka
Mehdi what a master of cornering this politicians. I watched this one and a very recent one with the kenyan majority leader kimani. This  politicians enjoy a free pass and are not held accountable by their respective local media. Please try President Hassan of Somalia next. Thank you - you are a master on what you do.
This is what happens when a corrupted, hypocritical politician meets a real journalist. Hats off to Mehdi Hassan ❤
ranil he is a the killer .
Ranil Wickramasingha utterly failed with this interview.
He should be accountable for Batalanda Masacar
He was the biggest reason for all the racism conflicts in the nation ☝🏻
Hats off Al jazeera,for revealing the real culprits in srilnka
Two main points corruption and war crimes. Corruption, of course question all you want. He is being there for the whole thing. War is a different thing. Both races have been damaged. If you say innocent sri lankan tamils in jaffna were killed, sri lankan sinhalese will say they killed innocent sinhala monks and they did bombings in colombo. It’s never going to stop, blaming game. Both sides were wrong. All in all innocent people were killed. All you can do is help the families of those innocent people build and make sure it never happens again. That’s the best justice you give for a person who gives their life to make a stand for a cause.
This was the answering pattern we have seen last 50 + years. Egoistic. Can break any laws under them. What a shame!!!
You have edited this. show whole interview.
he should interview Donald Trump in the same manner
Thank you Al Jazeerah for this interview. It's ❤️‍🔥
Please let this current president stay forever 🙏 God protect and guide our president Anura kumara
President RM has done a good job there. The journalist always tries to get a word from him about war crimes. No matter what kind of question he asks, he eventually steers the conversation toward it. The audience is completely biased—they are all on the side of the LTTE terrorists.
Great question
@Aljazeera Please provide the full interview, as Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe is denying the accusations and claims that Al Jazeera intentionally edited out the portions where he addressed the questions in his demand.
The journalist is a fraud! Not giving time to answer a question. Just questioning questioning all the time, is that journalism ?😂 This is a paid   program by Ltte terrorists survivors & tamil diaspora who tried to devided the country, why anyone dont ask how many innocent sinhalese civil persons died by tamil terrorists bombing outside of the war area ? Such a one sided interview. well done
This is the way how the media interviews must be performed.❤
All these are to revoke LTTE prohibition and Seek seperation in our country . Mehdi is running under someone's hand
This is time to grow up srilankan kids give priority to law and order not for race snd religious things.. Accept the false.. Move on
He has only SUPPORTED RAJABAKSA and MAHINDA. After all he is a relative.
Thanks Al Jazeera
මුත්තා හිතං හිටියේ මේ අසේං කියලා වෙන්නඕන

He said, "I got elected by Parliament." However, the entire Parliament is corrupt, with some members having criminal backgrounds and lacking proper educational qualifications. This is why most people chose not to support him, even though he took action during the economic crisis. The Parliament members knew they could rely on Ranil Wickremesinghe’s support. However, the people wanted a country governed by the rule of law. After 76 years of being ruled by corrupt politicians, they had grown tired of the system.  But I agree on what he said on 39:30
කලිසමයි ජංගියයි දෙකම ඔලුවෙන්ම ගැලවුනි
මුත්තා වැල් පාලමෙන් පැන්නා

Taje Mahinda Rajapakaha
Whatever Ranil wickramasinghe said, some of them are totally false
So called leaders in srilanka 😂
Appointing this childish  desensitized man  once as President and 6 times as Prime minister  itself proves the majority is always wrong. Shame on Rajapakse and Wickramasinge.
salute al jazeera
Bad show from Al Jazeera! Their narrative is clear especially given the panel. They should have had the courtesy to put the full interview up.
Sir lanka fox's
Wow ...great work
During his regime 88-93 we lost 65000 Sinhalese youth, and another 60000 tamils and 30000 forces.. These so called politicians are the crisis we face now, not only they murdered the people,they also murdered the economy. When he came to parliament Sri lanka's economy was only second to Japan, and 50 years down the line, they made the country to bankrupt.
Ranil wikramasinghe and mahinda rajapaksha are stupid dogs.
First of all, War crimes happen in every war!! War is war!!. LTTE is the terrorist group who had invented suicide killing. Also LTTE were hiding in Hospitals and firing artillery. Hats off to Ranil Wickremesinghe for this interview against bunch of LTTE carders!!. That girl who survived in Mullivaykal spoke English like a native UK person.  How old is she 22? Lol she must be 4 in 2009. War crimes my foot
I’m very proud of Mr Ranil Wickramasinhe & his replies
....my Respectable and Honorable Sir...This guy says.....the JUNDA????? What's the meaning of JUNDA..... Bulshit.... this is that guy number 1 JUNDA... this guy can't... never ever give the Proper answer.... this guy is the main switch of RAJAPAKSA'S FAMILY.... and this guy is a ... make...or made our country... as a bottom of destroy Our Country like a very poor countiesen... So this RANIL😅  RAJAPAKSA'S is a Underwear of RAJAPAKSA'S FAMILY...so Ranil RAJAPAKSA'S is a number 1 of JUNDA I'm so sorry for saying this.... and also very sad... this guy Protect Only RAJAPAKSA'S FAMILY....NOT 🚫 NEVER PROTECT any Our Sri Lankans People's or Community...,
He was a flipping joke from beginning to the end got humiliated 😂
As a Sri Lankan, I am proud of this journalism - real journalism at its best !
Greedy Ranil, funny Ranil, 😁 very bad man Ranil, wicked man Ranil we don't want anyone Ranil and Rajapksha family
Shame of this monster.... see how he behave infront of international media...disgusting
Shame of this monster.... see how he behave infront of international media...disgusting
this is called real journalism , I kindly requested to Al Jazeera to translate this video in Sinhala and Tamil Language and publish it , our people really want to watch this.
Ranil Wickremesinghe, as the former President of Sri Lanka, showed exceptional leadership during the country’s most challenging moments in 2022. Amid a severe economic crisis, widespread protests, and political instability, he stepped into a situation where many others hesitated. Despite facing immense criticism and difficult circumstances, Ranil demonstrated resilience and commitment to stabilizing the country.  His decision to take on the presidency during such a turbulent period was not one made lightly, but rather with a sense of responsibility to restore order. He took bold steps to negotiate with international creditors, implement financial reforms, and try to bring about economic stability. He worked tirelessly to secure assistance from global institutions, aiming to protect Sri Lanka from further economic collapse. Ranil’s pragmatic approach to diplomacy and crisis management helped steer the country through a time of uncertainty.  While no leader is perfect, it’s important to recognize the efforts of those who step up during the darkest times, especially when they attempt to address deep-rooted challenges. Sri Lankans should appreciate the hard work and dedication that Ranil Wickremesinghe put into lifting the country, even when it seemed like all hope was lost. Acknowledging the efforts of leaders, no matter how controversial, is a vital step toward healing and moving forward as a nation.
Disguesting prssenter. Not allowing to answer ..what kind of journalism like this
Hats off to Al Jazeera. Really proud to see the way handle this corrupted politicians
Mr Hazan do you can ask questions from Former USA President like this 🤣
නාකියාව හු  @#$ ලා ගත්තේ අල්ලේ තියලා.. This is called real journalism.. !! Hats off Hassan Mehdi.
Wow! Well Done to the journalist!
If Srilankan journalists question like way you did …. They will be in haven…. And Ranil talks about Rajapaksha family he will be in havens to lol 😂
That's how Ranil answer to srilankan people..😂😂 And he is the one of who responsible for this crisis in srilanka
Honestly Mehdi acted like a child here. Like he always does.
Puffy Ranil is A SHAMELESS Politician Who wants to Rule HOOK OR BY CROOK. He is Also A Part of Rajapaksas
In Sri Lanka these corrupted politicians never accept what they have done to our motherland. They make her beg from all over the world. Still these shameless dirty politicians want power not because they love our country still wanted to destroy my motherland. They are the curse 😡
இலங்கை மக்களின் சாப கேடு இந்த நரி
Hats off to the journalis. He got the real journalism unlike some of biased SriLankan journalists who will never ask such questions from Ranil.
He is like a joker,Mr ranil rajapaksha
I don't understand why Sri Lankans are happy about grilling RW. This is just a stunt by the LTTE to gain sympathy, nothing more. If you're a respectful Sri Lankan, you should realize that those Tamil diaspora members are humiliating Sri Lanka, not him.

❤❤❤❤
Some said Ranil is the saviour 😂😂😂of srilanka not in. Aljazeera
Ranil messed Sri Lanka
You dumb sri lankans, why do you like the grilling that happens to RW,this a set up by the LTTE to bring it's laws and bs back to SL.
26:30  that  Silence is defening 💀💀💀
Thank you, Mehedi Hassan and Al Jazeera, for finally revealing the allegedly covert politician, RW, who has been occupying Sri Lankan parliament for many decades. Your program is a massive consolation for those who have undergone state terrorism.  Although many Sri Lankans wouldn't grasp the gravity of what was exposed, the right crowed is now aware of the grave situation of RW.  RW usually conveniently dodges Sri Lankan journalist but not well articulated questions of Mehedi.
මුළු ලෝකෙම පච උනත් මේ රටේ ඉන්නවා හරක් ගලක් මෙකලව ඉහලින්ම තියල රට තවත් වල පල්ලට දන්නා බලන් ඉන්න කාලකන්නි සෙට් එකක්. ඉතින් අපෙත් කරුමේ ඒක. මොනවා කරන්නද ඉතින්.
I don't like the former President Rani.W. Being said that I don't think the true situation can be understood by the way the questions are asked one after one as they were not simple situations. To be honest it's kind of misleading the current situation for the listeners. the ones who live in the country faces difficulties in the system through out the country. It's the same everywhere which most of the developing countries are facing. If it's Sinhala Tamil or Muslim everyone is the same. The ones who are out of Sri Lanka has the same mind set which when they left the country. Everyone has to change, come to the present and find a better future for everyone. I don't think this helps the country to unite, this helps separatists mostly in my opinion. By developing the nation all should find reasonable solutions for the victims of the conflict but not to break the country again and again for politics and ratings.
Very shame Ranil talking about like this front of whole world 🌎we don't want anyone Ranil and Rajapksha family to stay in Srilanka. Ranil like to kill people
MURDERER Ranil
Srilankan political joker... cheap one in sl
07/03/2025
Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a very brutal man since the past and behaves as if he has no feelings with a smiling face and is a man who has laughed and cut the necks of the poor people who were very angry because the countrymen did not elect him as President. This super-brutal man had a little wisdom or an educated and intelligent mind to build a country. Every time he was the Prime Minister of the country and made temporary demographic changes, the country's economy was massively destroyed with lightning speed. This beast is a strong example to the whole world to prove that no matter how educated someone is, no matter how much he has, he is an empty person who is unable to implement it in practice. This beast has a natural tendency to run away from problems, hide, hide, and crush people. The world can take this seriously in international discussions. For future politics The true nature of these vile criminals should be exposed in all schools and universities around the world. He is the world's second Hitler.
Ranil is a animal 🤨
Great interview,  much needed to bring these politicians to account, but not enough for what they did to ruin the country and the Tamil people.
Did anyone question other countries like this? Why Sri Lanka.
hoda wede pagyta
Ranil is a thief and a mass murderer
What is this guy is doing here, he must be in jail by now. Shame on all srilankans who vote this ##
Ranil is an orthodox catholic who converted for his ill logical powergrab and to become what he thought the ought to be
As a Sri Lankan thanks for this interview this man here one of the top 3 terrorist in Sri Lanka and others are prabhakaran and Mahinda Rajapakshe
Ranil made this economic crisis by spending the loaned Foreign currency by putting the country depend on the consumption, and he played well as a politician to be in the power not to make many political or economic reforms, he was the person who assassinated the Sri Lankan economy.
Iam sri lankan.. and iam enjoying how mahidi asking these question and enjoying how struggle he answer to it
Batalandya   speaks  as  if  he  had  been  a  Saint  !
30:19 30:21
Well done, Mr. Vikram Singh you have handled the interview very well. It is once I interview but you did the battle for Sri Lanka. I don’t think any of our current political leaders can do 10% of what you did in this interview. Good luck.
தமிழன்டா
The real situation that all the Sri Lankans had been experienced more than 5 decades The real unfortunate  They are Dictators  Great program Al-Jazeera  Hats off to the announcer
Ananda   Wijepala   Sombi  gottek   !
This is so satisfying to watch!🔥 superb questioning mehdi and thank you al jazeera. I just wish you could interview Rajapakshas too.
Ltte al jezeera😂
Please invite Rajapakshe to another interview for all of us Sri Lankans.
😂😂😂
As me bring a Sri Lankan I'm very happy to see this interview for bring out the truth about Politician like Ranil as this is a eye opening for my people to know who they really are as some idiots are still they are the GODS who was there to bring our county good
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe say I seat with majority with Sri lankans Buddhist and hindus🙏🔥
Chamuditha's International version. 🤣
Thank you ❤
Denial 😂😂😂
This is a good opportunity to read about Ranil and how he played his time boasting that I am a genius of changing every situation. Wow
This shameless canny politician , cold blooded murderer of thousands , infamous Ranil Wickramasinge has become a joker at this international interview . He has made whole country  a mockery answering stupidly . His foolish answers are not relevant and he tries to slip away like an eel . What a shame ! What a sorry figure is this cocky laughingstock !
I think probably there should be an interview with Mahinda as well
To all the people around the world: This is what we Tamils live under in Sri Lanka, except for the good president Anura's Government. Fighting against these injustices are what earned the name "TERRORISTS" for most Tamil people in Sri Lanka.  The thing is, Sri Lankan government never had a bad side! They had just two, either good or ugly and dark!
Those who were mercilessly killed in mass graves in Batalanda ,can rest in peace after this interview. 😭🙏🏼
Un okkoma yaluwo malli
One and only personality to 🇱🇰  answering like this to this type of conversation .
Omg the interviewer is awesome!! Ranil you didn’t get in because you were in Rajapaskas pocket and you’re old!
It is truly shameful to see so many people supporting Al Jazeera Journalist and their co. when we all know the history of Al Jazeera and how their behavior during the war. Mr. Ranil tried his best to defend against those allegations. People have forgotten the deadly civil war where many people from both parties have suffered to the same extent. Imagine if this war was not ended, it would have been just like the Gaza. To everyone who supports the current NPP government and people who have hope on them, even Mr. Anura Kumara supported the then president Mr. Mahinda.
Real journalist he done his job well..superb. 👌congratulations from Sri Lanka
I've never seen Ranil get exposed like this in my life. He must have thought it was just another platform for one of his cynical speeches. The Rajapaksas and Ranil are criminals in every sense.
Thank you Mehdi Hassan for fighting for Sri Lankans. We respect your courage which we never saw in local journalists.
RW is lying! The President appointed him as the PM.
😂 ලංකවෙ උන් මොඩ උනට ලොකෙ මිනිස්සු මොඩ නැ රනිල් ගොතයාට රෙද්දෙ රෙවුනා
Thanks aljazeera
rANIL IS NOT gOOD PPERSON, HE MAKES HUGE PROBLEM TO SRI LANKA
Thanks Al Jazira
Ranil is not the real President of Sri Lanka. He is only the temporary savior of the corrupt rule of the Rajapaksas. He can never become the President with the majority vote of the Sri Lankan people. Now a good democratic government has been established in Sri Lanka and soon these corrupt rulers will be punished for their past corrupt actions. ✊
Hats off Al Jazeera.........❤️🔥💯🇱🇰👏😂🤭🤦‍♂️
I can't recall a time in Parliament without Ranil. For years, he held every significant title, yet achieved nothing. He failed to bring the change we so desperately needed. Our country deteriorated with each passing day, and he remained just another cog in the corrupt system. People had already lost hope in him. Though he somehow became president, it wasn’t by our choice. If you still don’t understand why you failed, it’s clear you need to work on your ability to analyze and reflect.
Im Sinhalee , Sri Lankan , Respect Al Jazzera for questioning this criminal (ranil) like this... no any sri lankan or indian media could do this... Bring Mahinda Rajapaksha & Gotabaya Rajapaksha also... They seems to 2 parties.. but they are all in same Family.... 🥵
Would like to see you jumping at a leader whos counties have killings on daily basis to ask these questions.
When it comes to Sri lankan politicians, when they are in trouble, they cjoose religion 😂 Specially Buddhism  What cunning dogs are these
Mahdi was playing the "I Got You" game.
poor ranil
Ranil Busted😂 Next Namal Rajapaksa 😁
As a young Sri Lankan , I'd love to see these type of journalism to wide spread in our country and in mainstream channels too❤
Thank you Mehdi Hasan and Al Jazeera, I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for your interview in bringing the truth to light and exposing the true faces of those involved in war crimes and genocides. Your "Head to Head" program is an invaluable resource in holding perpetrators accountable and ensuring that these atrocities are never forgotten. Thank you once again
what about the killings over 30 years, even if you can justify the cause they were fighting for? This type of solutions are generations old.
Sri Lankan Mr Bean🤣
Thank you❤️ al jazeera from all sri lankan🇱🇰
How gave him a job in al jaseera asking foolish questions without proof no background working just asking like some uneducated opposition and not even listening to the answer
Great interview ❤
Ranil 🤡 vs Man..   When you face the real man  then only you  will find yourself until that you will think you are a man.
Ranil force CJs decisiona.,shame on Ranil
Mehdi sounded like Piers M not waiting for a reply, lest it was the truth.  These interviews are a farce _ interruptions and  more and more like CNN and BBC.  Hopefully, Sri Lankans will survive what has happened and will come out a peaceful nation. Hopefully, we see refined discussions _ now it is CGTN that has a reliable and worthwhile program
He isn’t a good interviewer. He doesn’t allow Mr. RW to answer
He fixed our economy, thats better than making the counrty worse. I think we should let the man rest.
If there was a legal election and had a majority, is it a crime in Sri Lanka? when it is the accepted democratic process for the whole world.
Ranil 😂😂😂
geeeezzz… such a shame…once a clown always a clown
Well done Ranil Wickremesingha you handled it well...Love from Sri Lanka...
Waterloo of RW and I think the end of another cussed political journey!
Thank you Mehdi Hasan and Al Jazeera for bringing the truth and exposing the true faces of those involved in war crimes and Genocides.  Your Head to Head is invaluable in holding perpetrators accountable and ensuring that these atrocities are never forgotten.
I was thinking like.. he was ambushed by these questions, not like the ones he was told that he would get, but instead he got the real ones which he didnt prepared.. anyway super comedy..
Bro thinks he is the Srilankan Winston Churchil 🤣 I'm so happy!!
Aljaseera journalist know better than ranil, it's shame ranil you have  behave arrogant manner , it's shame all over world in live recognize who you are.......the truth everyone knows, when you trying to cover single matter 10000 lies you have to dispaly, shame ranil been as sri lankan.😮😮😮😮😮 look at the audience facial impressions 😮😮😮😮 it's international visualaize.
Ranil is one of them in Rajapaksha clan. This mother.fu...destroyed the country. Do not put religion on front of your bullshit...mf.
What an embarrassment
biased journalism….. deliberately designed to corner RW, with a clear agenda of criticizing Sri Lanka’s political system and the Sinhala majority.. interview was heavily edited… cut from 1.5 hours to 50 minutes as per RW press release .. removing key parts of his responses.. where the ethics.. impartiality.. may be it’s sponsored by Tamil Elam diaspora.
Raise Sri Lankan Hats to Mr. Mehdi Hasan and Al Jazeera team🥰🥰. You have done tremendous job here.  We are shammed here in Sri Lanka, none of the journalist could have questioned this political cockroach who is responsible for brutally killing future of the country at  Batalanda.   Excellent way of questioning to the point. No way to escape. Superb.💯
Al jazera media no 1 ❤❤❤❤❤
liar Ranil he is defending his alliance coward Rajapaksha  because he married his cousin
Thank you for interviewing this man directly like this.... i am from sri lanka and this man destroyed our country our youth like a monster
Al Jazeera Aura 📈📈📈
This Journalist is trying to put in his own words on this Sri Lanka's representative.
so embarrassing, I'am sorry.
This is the real journalist ❤
I don’t understand why Sri Lankans are happy about grilling RW. This is just a stunt by the LTTE to gain sympathy, nothing more. If you’re a respectful Sri Lankan, you should realize that those Tamil diaspora members are humiliating Sri Lanka, not him.
I ask those who say "RW is a GREAT leader" to watch this patiently for several times and observe his body language. Ranil Wikramasinghe's childish tactics may work in the context of Sri Lanka, but not here. Highly appreciate you, MEHDI, for revealing the hollowness of this man. (Maybe for the first time in his decades-long political career)
l would say, this is a must watch interview for all Sri Lankans. Facts and figures were presented yet he couldn't answer a single question accurately.
I don't think any of the other politicians could even hv the guts to be here. Not saying ranil was good but man had guts
11:25 funny What's wrong 🥲
interviewer is not giving chance to speak. It just seems he is trying to establish his idea by just shouting. Very childish. If he is doing it calmly he can expose Ranil for what he is. But with the shouting and all not worth to hear.
to @Aljazeera and Mr. Mehdi, Ranil has made a statement to local media on his displeasure that interview was 2 hours long and only 1 hour was issued. Can we please have all 2 hours...
If @MehdiHasan resided in Sri Lanka, he would have likely been kidnapped in a white van—another great journalist would have been silenced through enforced disappearance.😅
Yes General Shavendra should be charged in internationally and also locally for to fraud in Sri Lankan Army
රනිල් සියට ගෙදර වෙලා ඉන්න බෑනෙ. හොඩ වෑඩෙ පක........
Hats off for RW for defending Shavendra, GR and MR
He is the main reason behind every problem happened in Sri Lanka. He robbed Central Bank of Sri Lanka with his Singaporean friend Arjuna Mahendiran
😂😂 wow just wow
Rani is a Snake
😂😂😂😂😂 what happened there 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅 ranil codemn Infront of the people 😂😂😂
Ranil Wickremesinghe Owes the Nation, Especially Its Youth, a Sincere Apology.  Ranil Wickremesinghe’s Al Jazeera interview was a humiliation for Sri Lanka, exposing his arrogance, inflexibility, and disregard for accountability. His dismissive responses ignored the struggles of Sri Lankans across race, class, and religion, reducing real suffering to political rhetoric. True leadership requires humility and engagement, yet he clung to his version of events, rejecting global standards of justice. His actions insult the younger generation, who deserve honest, responsible leaders. This was more than an embarrassment—it was a stark reminder of the failure of Sri Lanka’s political elite. Ranil Wickremesinghe owes the nation, especially its youth, a sincere apology.
Mr.wicremasinghe's behaviour shows what happened to our people and the country.
"He is correct—he has been in politics long before many journalists were even born. Some might argue that this is part of the problem. At one point, we were second only to Japan in terms of progress and development. However, these thugs have plunged my country into a debt trap and destroyed it in every possible way."
corrupted journalists and other people.we can tell that by just looking at their faces.funny thing is they judge Sri Lanka 🤣 0:10
Because  of Gotabaya Rajapaksha  steped down in a very  respectable manner and Ranil came forward to get the challenge  Srilankan people were able to protect the democracy . If this happen in any western country or in America don't they ask their ARMY FORCES to use their power to protect the  country and the state institution according to the law . These journalist never question  former precidants of in England ,America or any other powerful country .
4:40 and there it all begins 😂
The report of the commission on the crimes of the brutal murderer Ranil Wickremesinghe (Batalanda Commission) was not presented to Parliament by the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga because she was also involved in those crimes! Because the report was not tabled, Ranil Wickremesinghe has been acquitted and released!  We cannot expect righteous behavior from corrupt state rulers! He must definitely be punished!  The current government will definitely work for that!  We, as the people, expect international support for that process!
Mf just act like women and didn't let that old man finish. You failed as a reporter mf😂
Ranil’s like where’s Chamuditha 😂
Thanks for showing the world the true face of the monster.
A political stooge. Let's break the future of our country.
Junior Hitler - Ranil
Hate of ambhika... u keep ur grandfather alone with consequences 😂

I live in Sri Lanka.I think this is the best interview ... 🇱🇰🇱🇰
Great job Mehdi Hassan... RW got roasted.
Respect.. Ranil left😂😂
At this point aljazeera should realise the world luaghs at them when they claim to present news instead what the actually do is sell a narrative!! I don’t know much about the SL prez to side with or against him but at least let the man speak?
The interviewer is another version of "Chamuditha of Sri Lanka".🤣
ரணிலை தூக்குல போடணும் செய்த வேலைக்கு ....😡 ...Church bombing, இனப்படுகொலை காணாமல்ப்போன....
Why did the LTTE and the opposition and some racist parties work together to defeat Ranil and the government against the ceasefire agreement? What were the objectives? Because peace came, all Sri Lankans were safe to live in, right? People who had no voice in society took great advantage of it, didn't they? Why do we always try to use words that purify people's hearts? If a person dies in custody, it is unacceptable in any way. The law should also be enforced. Will justice be served to the victims by bringing them before the public with such a heart?
19:41 Ok 😂 He obliterated the entire point with a single word.
There was no difference between the government and the opposition, they were the same at that time. That's why no one reported against you.
Please someone add sinhala subtitles to this for our majority to understand the interview. 🙏
Hope mr.ranil took his preassure pills before and after the interview..
Please don't hide under the cover of Buddihism. You are a disgrace!!
Thank you Al Jazeera 😂😂  for undressing Mr. Ranil in front of a  large crowd!
Drama of political/Politician
Seems like Ranil found a new low after facing these real journalists!
This journalist never talks about worker rights and state of the construction workers in Gulf
He is lying 🤥 saying no one to take the government. He wanted to come to power with help of crooks.
Great leader, Ranil wickremesinghe ❤
its Looks Like This meeting organized by LTTE terrorist Organization (Prohibited by lot of countries). I think some LTTE members also there.😂😂. This Journalist not giving time to answer the questions. and also I noticed' He promoting his agenda.   As I feel; he is standing for his country. Some of foolish people not understand it. all thinks looking on with their political views.
Ranil is not a true savior & he is also a reason behind Sri Lanka's current economic crisis. Worthful interview.
Nice
To talk the truth, Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 is the only country in the World that has defeated a TERRORIST organization (LTTE) that was destroying a beautiful country.
Frist in thanks to aljazeera and this jounalist.Ranil is a political swindler and a swindler. He does not like those who oppose his views. He is also a man who falsely pretends to protect democracy. I say this as a Sri Lankan.
Ranil controlled it perfectly ❤Just LOOK AT ALL THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND RELATED PROTESTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THEY ALL FALL, and no one success. but this guy 🙂and No other international politicians can bring to this type of interview. When All the Muslim countries are in a mess, Sri Lanka is going toward success. SRI LANKA RECORDED AS the FASTEST RECOVERY FROM THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, thanks to Ranil Wikramasinghe ❤
Betting  all come out  that time say  I'm  do it  sure say ranil   katukabi ranil
🔥🔥🔥
This the quality of a president of Sri Lanka? Utter nonsense. The government is such a failure.
Good questions!
He lost because he protected Crooked Rajapaksha's Clan and corrupt public & business personnel who were funding them along with militia gangs run by some former politicians. Nobody in Sri Lanka trusted & accept these former corrupt politicians as honest leader for the huge challenge in front of them. age of the journalist doesn't matter, if he ask relevant questions from a crooked cunning politician. People choose to select a party with no corruption history & due to the qualities of the current Presidents leadership. This lunatic lives in the past & trying follow British monarch. when he become the president, he wanted a red bag similar to one the former British queen  was carrying on her foreign trips. he didn't think about high costs that he spent on foreign trips and functions functions they wanted to hold within the country. AG also crooked and a cohort of Ranil and Rajapaksha clan. what Mrs Rasarathnam says is exactly correct
Don’t even try to equal what happens in Gaza to what happened in Sri Lanka, there is no comparison, it is the US and the west you are backing Israel and we didn’t have west support.. it is the hypocritical west’s double standards. Oh I want to puke about this double standard west. By the way it seems this panel is surrounded by Tamil Tiger sympathisers. What about the destruction they caused to the country and for the Sinhala community. Don’t forget this is a Sinhala land for thousand of years
Awesome work Al Jazeera!
At least Mr.Ranil couldn't understand the question and give an answer.great questioning!🙌
These well known brural houses were operated by ranil and selected army and police officers. A president commission report says eveything that how ranil was behind everything. No one talked about murdered victims and their innocent families. Their parents also died after years of suffering on disserpearance of their sons and daughters
Give Namal Rajapaksha the next chance.
Batalanda murderer
Apart from the references to the separatist war part Ranil really got cornered for  unaccountability of his illegal actions. Then he tried to slip away by saying No Comments  That was childish and immature for a person who boasts of being in politics for a long time. He couldn't get off the hook of the journalist who is famous for his arrogance and doesn't have to worry of any repercussions like for Sri Lanka journalists !.
Al jazeera = Terrorist media
Ex president Ranil did well...❤ great leader
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 RANIL & RAJAPKSA HAS RAPE THE MOTHER LANKA WITH HIS THUGS SEVERAL TIMES  . WHAT A SHAME FOR SRI LANKA . FAIL STATE SRI LANKA : 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
The cunning jackal in sri lankan politics ranil wikkamasinghe met a real journalist at the end😂😂
Facing Mehdi head to head is every politicians nightmare.
My respect to The Journalist for beating Ranil Wickramasinghe's stupidity 👏.  This time he got zero marks. Lol 😆
Brother of Chamuditha 😂
Whatever this journalist tell. I stand with Ranil ❤ he is a one man army, masterminded who took the country when no one was there to rule and did everything he could. Even during the tamil sinhalese problem he was opposite side of the parliament so the person who shpuld be questioned is Rajapakshas ❤. This man is living legend but srilankan people failed to vote him in the election as they wanted to suffer more 😂😂😂. We stand with Rani.
Ranil Wickremasinghe is one of Sri Lanka's most brutal politician...
What the organized majority Tamil audience don't state is the thousands of civilians murdered by the ltte.any govt should take whatever steps necessary to stop murder when talks failed.infactost countries won't talk with terrorists.many of so called missing are now in western countries as economic refugees and continue the music to bring in their kith and kin in future too screaming blue murder.oppoertunists..
The journalist is trying to stick to the point & this clown of a corrupt politician trying hard to avoid answering the questions. This is how they get away from being accountable for the people in Sri Lanka.
රනිල් සීයාට කක්කත් ගිහිල්ලා
❤️❤️👍
Al Jazeera should do a similar head to head with both Mahinda and Gotabaya, who have more acquisitions than Ranil
Ranil is suffering from birth kind of Autism  cloud . The symptoms are confusing the opponent or joking or religious story and slip away! Also taking revenge from his opponent with very different silly philosophical notion!!!  Some how he will achieve what he wants !!! Like taking the seat of the Sri Lanka President , and taking revenge from Rajapakse and all his opponents political parties !! He took revenge from srilankans for rejecting him!!!
Indeed, he bears responsibility for some of his actions.  However, he also accomplished a lot of amazing things.  He made things possible.  His leadership helped us overcome the crisis situation.  Seeing one of our leaders be degraded in front of a crowd hurts me.  While conducting the interview, this Hasan guy did not adhere to any ethical standards.  embarrassing media program.
Finally he's back and back better off by meeting a real journalist!
Ranilage redde revila ine,batalanda bucher ranil
True all the srilanken love this interview😂😂😂👍👍👍
Some Sri Lankans think Ranil is a expert in Politics and he is only one who can relocate the country. In fact, Ranil is a political thug. He has brought in laws that violate the constitution several times. He has postponed elections. He has used various tactics to maintain his power. But, H could never be a people-selected President in Sri Lanka.
Ranil and his goons set fire to their own houses to steal billions of rupees as compensation while some even cheated and got money from the insurance companies
Bring mahinda rajapaksha
If peoples are saying this is a real journalist, that's is nonsense. Once you throw your question then you should wait for the reaction. From that reaction you can find the next question.. But this is a chicago bull.. not a journalist 😂
🧐
RW trying his usual evading tactics on international stage. Such an incompetent leader
Ranil is a thief and murder of thousands of young people in Sri Lanka . Sham on you mother f… cker .. most hated politician in history..
Ranil rajapaksha still sey layer  this man heat sri lanken peoples.... He allweys stey with gota and maina side..he xo deall
Thank you al jazeera, සිරසටත් ගොඩක් ස්තූතියි  පොනිලගෙ හෙලුව පෙන්නන්න  උපසිරස එක්ක මේක දැම්මට❤❤😊😊
Jaffna library was set ablaze by Ranila Unp government in 1981 after 1983 massacre of innocent Tamils & destroyed properties
Ranil❤
He is even manipulating that Noble Religion. He is the Biggest Liar on earth. Easter Sunday was planned by the Rajapakses for Gotabhya Rajapakse to come to Power. Some of his Ministers knew this was happening. He was supporting the People's Struggle and once he got the power he arrested those youth and water bombed them. It was the SIS behind the Easter Attack. I wish I were in that audience. Hats off to you Sir, for a fantastic journalism and being brave and straight. He always tells them that he will not answer those questions when he is defensive. That Smirk smile he has shows that he does not care about anybody. The only thing he is good at it breaking parties and TRICKING PEOPLE. Batalanda commision report does not have that because that evidence was given in private and this man negotiated to not publish those. That man was killed by this man. That MAN was his lover. RANIL is the Batalanda KILLER.
Ranil says like I havent manner casue  I'm a politician I hope u'll be better mannered
we can clearly know Ranil rajapksha Is real, RW is the guy who is behind this all dramas in srilanka , hes uses every Political games since 2000s to survive on politics and his luxury life
Ranil got exposed like a clown
This mf still alive😂😂😂😂
Respect Ranil Wickramasinge! Aljazeera is fake news !
This proves Chamuditha is better.. asks a question and he answers him self and not letting him to answer.. what is expected from this interview is a questions.
Shameless, he and the rajapakse are absolutely shameless.
Please roast rajapakshas as well
Ranil talks nonsence not the catholic church.This man is lost before the people
මේ මාද්‍ය විනය ලංකාවේ සෑදිය යුතුමයි
Not the best interview I've seen.. yes medhi asked good questions but never allowed to answer and vica versa ranil was being a joke by acting like a child.. the issue is he was asked loaded questions that cannot be answered simply..
Ranil got checkmated 😂
Mehdi...poor conduct of interview....you have to give respect to the person you are interviewing...you jus kept on shouting at him....not your fan anymore
It is the very same Cardinal and the catholic board who infamously campaigned for Rajapakshas even after the Easter bombng.
This is the  man who destroyed our dreams...Thank u Al Jaseera ❤
Now do these foreigners think that only tamils were killed by sinhalese soldiers, How about the sinhala and tamil civilians killed by the LTTE terrorists.
Thank you Al jazeera
How come you guys not talking about what Tamil tigers did to our country?  LTTE did the War crimes not our sri lankan army.  You guys are famous for hiding the truth. Talk with people who care about sri lanka not from the people who destroyed the country.
Thank you very much for your direct suestioning
Ranil wickramasinghe is full curropted fully responsible for batalanda, central bank bond, porotecting curropt Rajapakse and many more...
Ask him about Battalanda
Ranil was favorable to Rajapaksa not to the nation
Suprem courts was no free ans fair instant
Thank you Al Jazeera for exposing this extremely corrupt and dangerous Ranil. He is a murderer and a shameless thief. He should be in prison for his crimes.
A long awaited interview (with the excellent questions) for Sri Lankan. Well done Mr. Mehdhi Hassan. Hats off!
He is not there to talk on Buddha 😅😅😅
Amazing interview,  thanks Aljazeera.
He never appologised. He talkes nonsence am ashemed of him.
60,000 to 100,000 young teenagers were killed, tortured and raped by ranils government just because they were with the jvp (the leftist party) my grandma was inserectionist so is my grandfather both of them live today grandma is U A NANDASILIE she is one of the founding members of the party all the way with rohana we rule the government after all their deaths was never in VAIN
Most disgusting politician in SL
It's indeed puzzling why Mr. Wickramasinghe didn't bring up the civilian casualties caused by the LTTE. The Sri Lankan Civil War was a tragic conflict that resulted in loss of life on both sides. It's essential to acknowledge the suffering of all Sri Lankans, regardless of their affiliations.
What a layer the poor lost their hared earned money. He was made president by Rajapaksa family thats all. To protect Rajapaksa power crecy Ranil Rajapaksa was made president
i am a sri lankan , Excellent journalism. well done to Al Jazeera, this is who is Ranil , he is a person who lead the county to bankruptcy, he only enjoy power no sense of common man. greed for power is what he only enjoy. he is still the leader of UNP party over 30 years i believe ,  not even giving a chance to another youn person.
Make inquiry and question, interview Palestine Israel war, Russian Ukraine war
As a Sri Lankan, I had a hellish feeling about our country until September 21, 2024, that everything was taken over by an extremely corrupt ruling clique that was enjoying itself by deceiving and oppressing the people by all the lawless state institutions and politics controlled by the corrupt. But patriotic people have been struggling in various ways to save this country from this corrupt politics for many years. Among them, JVP founder Rohana Wijeweera cannot be forgotten. It is not surprising that in our country, since then, they have betrayed their country, nation, money and power in front of things like that. But today, it has been confirmed before our eyes that the corrupt journey that the majority of the people have taken so far has brought the country to anarchy. As my grandfather and father said, the reason why there are LTTE terrorists in our country is because of JR. Jayewardene becoming the president of the country and the racist and religious concepts he adopted. But when I study this, I think differently. I see the LTTE as a conspiracy to ensure the long-term existence of this political elite and the corrupt political clique. The reason for this is that at times the political elite of that time even provided weapons to this LTTE. There is ample evidence for this. I see the founder of JVP, Rohana Wijeweera, as someone who saw all these conspiracies from afar. He and his patriotic colleagues were destroyed by the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa and Ranil Wickremesinghe, including the state police and the army, during the 88,89 terror period. But they could not destroy its essence. Today, what Rohana Wijeweera said has become a true reality. For these reasons, the people were able to form a government of the National People's Power led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which was led by another patriotic organization of people led by the JVP built by Rohana Wijeweera. Ranil Wickremesinghe is addressed in Sri Lanka as the "tormentor of the Batalanda". I proudly declare that the people are no longer stupid enough to bring Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Rajapaksa gang, who resorted to theft, corruption and state-sponsored murder to maintain their power, to power again in Sri Lanka. Mahinda Rajapaksa is the leader who took the initiative to end the war in the country. But since that time, he and his gang have been exploiting the people of the country, creating small leaders who deceive the people on the surface and give them a share of this state money and work only thinking about maintaining power. It is a well-known secret that Rajapaksa planned the Easter attacks during the 2015-2020 regime. But as a result of the bad work he did, the country's economy collapsed and the public uprising was so powerful that Gotabaya was forced to hide. The Rajapaksas stepped down from the scene, using the power of parliament again and handing over the task of protecting the Rajapaksas to Ranil Wickremesinghe. So you can understand that all these people are like one. Whether Ranil is from one political party or Rajapaksa is from another party, they are all one. At the moment of trouble, they are one. Who stood for the people? They are the current rulers of the country. If there is anything to be gained from this, look at the problems in the countries of all those who see this, and take only the good. No matter what, all people are equal. In death, you have to go alone. Let this be an example for all those who appoint good rulers for their country.
Thanks al jazeera
We have not found a journalist in Sri Lanka who has the knowledge and ability to question politicians who evade issues like Ranil. Our thanks to this excellent journalist.
thanks Al jazira. Sri lanka is full of curropted politicians.both Rajapakse and  Wickramasinghe
Is everything a game to you ???  Yes he was a gamer and he played with sri lanka .. rw mf
Finally a journalist who asked all the right questions from a corrupt srilankan politician
Shame on you Ranil arrogant criminal
Thank you for showing the world his bad behaviour and weird discipline! So what journalist talking about, that’s the real truth! If Srilankan government can’t punish them,the world need to know the truth!
යකෝ! සුදු වෑන් එකක් එ‍යි බලාගෙන.
The cabinet interfeared in all decisions and the justice.The justice was biased
You have not given chance RW, you have been out casted , don’t BS
None of the Sri Lankan journalists had the courage to counter attack as this journalist cause they feel unsafe. RANIL THE FOX destroyed our motherland slightly as like as he speaks here without show casing the shame
Ranil and JR Jayawardana try to stop the killings in 83 black July ????? ..... excuse me.... JR's government where Ranil is also part is the ones who ochestrated the killings in 83 black july, and also burning down of Jaffna library.
Very first time ranil met a real journalist.
As a sri lankan I respect for AI jazeera to bringing this interview
What a  display of HYPOCRACY  by this terror-friendly media,  a murderous western nations such as brits and terrorist nations in the middle east are questioning 'CIVIL WARS' and 'EASTER BOMBING' in Sri Lanka.  These so called 'liberal media' always attempts to hide their criminal history by picking eastern leaders who tries to solve the problems started by western colonist. Now these western colonist and their media friends mock those leaders. What a pathetic media.
Terrible lier.....
I do not support Ranil; however, I consider this interview to be pathetic. Mehdi Hasan's questions were groundless and biased, even worse than those of Sri Lankan journalists Chamuditha and Suranga, who does not permit the other party to speak. I am extremely proud of Ranil, he navigated the interview successfully even though Hasan and the other questioners attempted to catch him off guard. Thank you Ranil, you stood for the nation!
Another joker defending him disgrace
What a layer 😅😅😮😮
Of cause he violated the constitutions and the country.He becme the president through the Rajapaksa family.What he says he all nonsence
❤well done journalist ❤🎉
Ranil got pummeled by Mehdi , I’m not sure how people have left this man Ranil to have his head still on his shoulders, astonishing.
Ranil the 80 year old spoilt brat
Well done aljazeera and mehedi love from Srilanka ❤
When you ask about war crime they have no guts to face the question in front of the world, shame on them..
Ranil did practiced before coming to this interview...... with chamuditha. Thanks Al Jazeera for tough questions. No one asked these real questions in Sri Lanka. In SL these policians ack like they are untouchable.
Mr. Batalanda ranil
Ugly politics 😂
This is an example of arrogant and intimidating journalism. Whenever Mr. Wickramasinghe attempts to respond, Mehdi interrupts and dominates the conversation with an outburst of verbal dirrhoea, either quoting or repeating the question.
Real journalist vs fake politician Ranil made more than 14 commissions... result 0, cost more than 500billion RS,,, as an example  easter attack commission huge respect Al Jazeera..  Ranil & mahinda are best friends..
Thank you Al Jazeera!!!! ❤🎉 say it like it is. can’t believe Ranil actually faced you. This narcissism and GASLIGHTING is just a normal part of Sri Lankan culture. This man is a crook, hates the youth, covers up crime and he is lying he was so sure and was scoffing the opposition thinking he would win the election. Lost like a dog and everyone from every single generation is happy he is gone. Now him and his goons are making life so hard for the incumbent president to cover up their tracks.  Please interview our current president he’s incredible ❤
Can you interview Anura kumara disanayake and sirisena please.
චමුදිතය හොඳයි අප්පා ...මූ එක්ක බැලුවම ....Chamuditha is good, when I look at him...😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Mehedi you need to learn more about what happened in Sri Lanka for past forty years before interviewing a man like Wickramasinghe.This time you have failed.
What a layer and a arrogant fool. He is lying .Get rid of him
First thank you Aljazeera for questioning him, because no media in sri lanka would do that..😢 Second if you are watching this, sri lankan medialogist 😅😅 please learn from Aljazeera. Third 😢 this man should be punished by the law for what he did to our nation by genocide . And also he put the blame for the same people..
Sri lanka do mot have any issues regarding ethnicity or religion.  Sri lanka boasts peace that no country can match. The majority,  Buddhists temples have Hindu kovils inside . Which countries have such protection towards other religions ?  And in April the most peaceful celebration is held with the majority Singhala and Minority people.  Amy ethnicity,  any religion observing person can have all the benefits of public and private sector. Period.  The ltte was a proxy war. Ltte was funded by the western countries and facilitated by the Catholic Church. Why ?   Sri lanka is the only place suitable as a commercial hub and in terms of military in South Asia. So the west wanted to put roots in sri lanka. Second is Buddhism.  The most feared religion to the Catholic Church.   Second , the former president Mahinda Rajapakse defeated the ltte terrorists when the west did not want it to end. In fact at the near end of the war , western officials came to sri lanka to preassure the presidents to stop defeating the ltte. But they failed. That's the main reason for the continuing anger towards the Rajapaksha family.  Former president Gotabaya Rajapaksha had a vision to glorify sri lanka. And that was not accepted by the west as well. So , for example t USAID  funded the sri lankan protestors to overthrow the government and make sri lanka another Iraq or Syria.  But that when Ranil Wickramasinghe came and used his extreme administration skills to get sri lanka back on her feet.  And the accusations of human rights violations.  Sri lanka government had protocols.  The government had limits. But the ltte terrorists did not have that. Suicide bombing , torture,  child soldiers,  civilian killings, child and women killings were 99% of the ltte works. Prebakaran used the innocent tamil people as his human shield . Now the ghosts of ltte are trying to keep the business alive. Nothing more.  And finally the easter attack.  One of the fathers of a then minister has inforem him not to go to the church on that day. This father was the main financial contributor to the Church. And all vip s did not go to the easter day service.  Including Cardinal Malcom Ramjith.  Think why......... The bombing was done by am extreme Islamic group.  Anyone think that they will do such bombing to get Gotabaya Rajapaksha to power when Gotabaya Rajapaksha is a strong enemy of the extreme Islamic groups.   People  There are lots of media companies who are I'm the payroll of the ltte. And Channel 4 😂😂 that's the media channel of the terrorist ltte.  Think before deciding.
At least compensate the poor families of north who suffered immensely due to ignorance leader ship of yours and rajapakshas.
Ranil and the Rajapaksas have destroyed Sri Lanka. Ranil is nothing more than a joker.he talks excessively but achieves nothing.
Well done Jurnelist. He likes only Rajapaksa family
සීයා තමයි හොදටම කරේ😂😂😂
Ranil is cooked
Ranil is a killer. A layer. Yes he used force and to kill he Sri Lankan.
what a joker ranil is All is a game for him 😒😒
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can you interview putin and zelensky regarding Ukraine war?
He asked for it !! lol mr bean !!
Ralil is sey bullshei. Batalade.  Shathan  sri lanken peaples never chear him
Ranil 🗿❤
Really appreciate as a Sri Lankan. In Sri Lanka these corrupted politicians are not get questioned like this.
Absolute joker on stage
Ranil 🙏
Thank you jazira 👍😁 and mahdi 👍
A HUGE THANK YOU  TO DEAR MR. RANIL WICKRAMASINGHE  FOR SAVING SRI LANKA FROM A CRISIS MOMENT IN 2022.
Ranil and rajapaskes appear as two oppposite parties infront of the world and that is the biggedt lie ever.They act like they are opposite but they are really working together as a single group on behlaf of their own intentions.When Gotabaya Rajapakshe resigned the president appointed was Ranil whose the most loyal one among this group.This party did the most biggest violences and corruptions in Sri Lanka.Still they do not accept this but thier souls may know who they are.
The Journalist riminds me Chamuditha
Amazing....these interviews must be telecast in SL TV channels with Sinhala subtitle.
Thank you, Al Jazeera! This man ruined our entire future, and I truly appreciate you exposing him in front of the media.  Sri Lanka is a beautiful country, and I’m grateful to Sri Lankans for chasing him out! ❤
Ranil the criminal..🤮
A group of pepole fight with a one brave man...the man face like a real lion ..❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You had Mr bean on show
Ranil is a pathological liar .  All the reporters present definitely understood that. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
While I'm not typically a fan of the Al Jazeera news channel, I was genuinely impressed by this interview. The level of journalism on display is exceptional and offers valuable insights—a good lesson for this narcissistic old gentleman. Excellent work!
yoo what happened to grandpa's Ferrari license😭
This is enough for the srilankans, now the most of the politicians might get rid of these questions I think they preparing for this. New government is doing the job correctly as far as they can, this idiot Ranil & Rajapaksha family ruined the country that's it.
Ranil is a serial killer
It's sad to see this comment section getting hyped about Ranil struggling 😅 of course some of the accusations are legit but the aim of this interview is very clear if you look at the audience and the board members 😂 Remember the quote Prabhakaran said? "Sinhalese only remember anything for 7 days "😂
Ranil is not a solution for Sri Lanka's problems, he is a part of the people who created those problems. He was in the ruling party in the country before lot of us were born. He is responsible for mass killings of 60 thousand youths during jvp uprising in 88-89. But thanks to the corrupted highly politicized judiciary system they themselves created, he avoided facing justice. This man is not a savior of SL. This man is the one who stopped the enquiries for rajapaksa corruption, and let the Eastet sunday bombs to happen.
Ranil is Buddhist by name sake, you are shame to be called as Sri Lankan
The most corrupt and greedy politician
Ranil answered well and calmly. Mehdi was trying to trap him with this report and that. Mehdi was rude and losing his cool. All reports from western agencies taken as gospel truth without criticism.
ලංකාවේ දී මෙහෙම ඇහුව මාධ්‍ය වේදීන් ඉන්න වා යාලුවා පැනලා දිව්වා.
Ranil is struggling hard 😂😂
Highly appreciate Al Jazeera to bring power Igor Ranil Rajapakse Not Ranil full salute to Al Jazeera ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
6:45 Nailed it 😂😂😂
This idiot finally met his match!!
Expecting Modi to appear for such an interview as well. That a$$h0le didn't gave any unbiased interview since the last 11 years.  Leader of the largest democracy, they say. 😂😂😂😂
It is amazing. What was more amusing was that no mentioning about utter menanze the LTTE had done to the whole country. It was far from what its name would suggest, it was not trying to liberate tamil people. Sinhalese and Tamils were living in this country harmoniously for 2000+yrs. Our genes provide proof for that. British created division amoung us to rule over us easily, and ourpoliticians used it continuously. LTTE was not different. It used hate to gain power and occupy land. As who lived through this war, LTTEkilled not only Sinhalese but tamils too. Specially at border villages. What about hundreds of suicide bombings? Massacre of people in border villages? Child abduction? Children at war?mass rapes? No mention aout that. Clearly funded by LTTE diaspora
Highlighting the great comments
Al jazeera seems to have to lot question. Have you ever questioned any US presidents up to date for all the way crimes they have done. Or atleast about guantanamo ??
Well done job, Mehdi Hasan. We need journalists like you to question the corrupted politicians.
Sri Lanka needs journalists like you Mehdi Hasan ❤🇱🇰 God bless you
Bane of Sri Lankan politics. Admire Hassan for pointing out the fact that RW length in politics is part of problem
Hats off to journalist.and Thank you al jazeera
Ranil is a main part of Sri Lankan economic crisis like rajapksha
He's the one who saved thieves and corrupts!
What a shame!
THIS JOURNALIST IS  PARTIAL IN THE UK A SYMPATHISER...WHY ????  IS ONE SIDED..BY AL JAZEERA HEAD TO HEAD PROGRAMME ??? ALL COMMUNITIES IN SL ARE SRI LANKANS  LIVING IN ONE COUNTRY. SRI LANKA never had a civil war ..... EVERY SRI LANKAN PAST PRESIDENT & PRIME MINSTER SO FAR HAVE DONE THEIR VERY BEST & SERVED SL VERY WELL. INCLUDE RANIL W. SRI LANKA never had a civil war - BUT HAD a Terrorist Problem - this needs to be corrected. " it is clear: Tamil people & the Tamil Tigers R NOT D SAME. Crimes & Atrocities committed by the Tamil Tigers were BRUTAL & unmatched, even by today’s Terrorist Groups. Sri Lanka was ravaged by the Tigers, A violent  A SAD 30 year war.
I am Buddhist 😂😂😂 last resort 😂😂
yes  that is true I also  believe he never faced a real journalist.
J.v.p.not for the update on your own going now Norwegian.ranil. Presidend

Al Jazeera 🫡
Mehdi Hasan truely speaks for Srilankan people
Hats off to mehdi, for tearing his hypocrisy and showing to the world, he is a hypocrite. Ranil always protected Rajapakses, with his dealing with opposition since 1993, enabled the opppsition to win while undermining and trying to keep the rising members away in his own party so that they wouldn't challenge his supremacy in the party,  always Ranil protected Rajapakse clan, he is instrumental in bringing them to power many times, because of the fact that he cannot win presidential elections and brought members from opposition or retired army generals instead of  appointing some one from his own party like Sajiith Premedasa, by doing so he destroyed the aged old party, which was the peoples choice since independence. There was a incident during Rajapkses reign, when there was going to be a protest opposite his party head quarters by his own party members supporters, Rajapakse sent blocked the entire road in the protext of latong a new layer of tar on the road, such was his connection with Rajapakses, thats why when things were becoming impossible for Rajapakses instead of handing power to the opposition or calling for new election they handed over the presidency to him, so that they can spend the rest of their period in power looting more, avoiding prosecution for the crimes they committed, enjoying shamelessly the perks in a bankrupt country, and trying to find new ways and means to hoodwink the people by postponing elections and win again he, executed everything to the point, except the people refusing to elect them again.  So Ranil has dirt on his gand for the plight if Sri Lanka and hindering prosperity to the nation because of his greed of power.  He is a repacious politician.
11:40, he confessed that they are friends.
dont clash with Amoeba like tiny creatures ,if you need a real interview try Putin, Biden, Jorge Bush,  Rodrigo duterteand and for extra spicy try Netanyahu.
Shame on you Ranil!
Germany good country.
He was there when they composed the constitution. And he knows every corner of it
හිඟන්නා නානවා නෑමක් ,මිනිහා ජාත්‍යන්තර පොරක් කියල පෙන්නන්න ගිහින්.
What  a    lovely  adorable   leadership

Very brave journalist
This forum had been full of LTTE sympathisers. They talk like saints but aren't they aware that Prabhakaran killed more of his own Tamils more than Sinhalese when fighting for a pure Tamil Eelam?
Weronika.textile
That journalist only just throw the question and not giving a chance to explain, maybe he already cornered
මූ නං පිස්සු හුත්තෙක් සිරාවට.. Look how callus he is with absolutely no ownership 🤮…
Tamil only Civilians sinhala Is not Civilians LTTE How many killed Sinhala and muslim people why you not talk it
Norwegian ranil president.verygood  sweden
the lousy system of justice you Speke of is the based on Roman Dutch and is a avatar of the colonialism that you represent Mr Deva =Athidiya ... and yes it is a lousy  and outdated system
இது PPC இல்ல ரனில் அய்யா அல்ஜசீரா மாட்டிக்கிட்டு முளிக்கிரார்😍
Thanks Mr Hasan 🙏
Very interesting.
At least Ranil had the balls to sit there!!! Now it is rest of the goons' turn.... Interview Shavendra Silva, Mahindha Rajapakse, Gota, Maithree, Fonseka.....
Someone translate this into sinhalese please
A cruel ruler wearing a tie. The whole world knows how they tortured and killed people inhumanly🤬🤬🤬
Beautifully done! Now do the Rajapakshas! ❤
This guy lying about 1983 riots....My brother came home after 27 days....survived without food ...
Ranil won’t do any more interviews with international media.
This is called as journalism.he is a journalist.
I'm from Sri Lanka. Thank you Ai Jazeera & Mr Journalist. Ranil is a Murderer & a Thief
Cunning Ranil messed with a wrong Journo! Mahdi is not the foot licking Chamuditha
This what real journalism looks like. Kudos to Mehdi ❤❤❤
Present president Mr.Anura Dissanayaka is the best leader in Sri Lanka  He hasn't any corruption ❤
Ranil Wickramasinghe is the mastermind behind the Batalanda torture chamber. He murdered young people. He is a politician who destroyed and robbed Sri Lanka. I am a Sri Lankan. Goodjob Mr journalist.
Tax is high now there . Not easy
interviewing by not allocating time to answer is journalism?  This is totally the vision of the journalist . He tries to prove his aspects. At least they must telecast/ upload the unedited version of the discussion . This is partial to killers who killed thousands of sri lankans  by Tamil tigers.
40:33  seeya fully destroyed🤣
This journalist doesn't have the patience to listen. He needs training on how to conduct an interview
Ranil met his match. His face expression tells it all . hats off to Mehdi
Usually Rani messes up interviews but this time Hasan acted like a donkey without letting the guest speak..
After watching this interview  what i can say is very soon the darling journalist of Ranil, Firstpost Mrs. Palky Sharma will rush to SL for a darling interview to paint a juicy picture of RW.
Just look this man has no empathy about people in Sri Lanka. He still trying to become the president and continue destroying the country.
They together killed people and brought our Sri Lanka on to its knees ,   still blatantly lies  Thank you for this interview  .👌😍
This is absurd. This is not a facts focused interview rather an emotionally driven  talk of the journalist who doesnt let the guest to talk.
As a sri lankan citizen I know RANIL WICRAMASINHE is a deliberate  liar .He directly instigated  , police officers such as Douglas peiris , Ronnie gunasinha  for murdering innocent young generation more than 60000 . This man's  supporter was late ugly president , Ransinha premadasa .
ලෝකයක් ඉදිරියේ රටේම රෙදි ගැලවූ පරිණත රනිල්
Ranil nailed it. Hats off.
මොල  හතේ චංඩියා.
Thank you Al,- Jazeera ❤❤❤❤
Both need to take time discuss these issues leisurely...no one is giving each other time to explain. This is like a 10 mins debate competition. Some of the major questions were not answered properly... :(
Without proofing and commisssion reports this media person is talking nonsense. Without evidence  we don't want trust any body or anything. Because anyone can say anything. Should we believe all rumours?
No jokes, No aathal Ranil left.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Give him chance to make standup comedy show😂😂😂i think he is better than HASSA(🇱🇰 famous standup comedian )
පාර්ලිමේන්තුවේ එක්කෙනෙක්ගේ ඝාතනය ගැන කියන්නෙ එතකොට පරණ කල් පැනපු ටියර් ගෑස්වලින් කී දෙනෙක් මැරුණාද ඒවා මරන නෙවෙයිද..රනිල් මහතා කියන්නෙ ලංකාවට බෝම්බයක්🤔.
Mr bean - Where is the report ??😂😂
BECAUSE SRILANKAN  VOTERS ARE STUPID AND IDIOTS. THEY COULDN'T RECOGNISE  THE  VALUE OF MR. RANIL WICKRAMASINGHE

Kudos to the interviewer for asking sharp and insightful questions 🎤🔥
As a Sri Lankan I couldn't be happier. Ranil RAJAPAKSHA is shivering. Thank Al Jazeera
Ranil Wicramasinghe 🤮This man is a disrespect to our country
Jews invaded Gaza and the West Bank, Jews invaded Lebanon, Jews invaded Syria, the Jews playing the same record as the Germans did to the Jews😂 Jews are the wandering tribe no one will accept the Jews after the GENOCIDE in Gaza👿👿👿👿👿👿
Thank you Al Jazeera. ❤
Mr. Mehdhi, You are the Man! 👌🏼♥️
He thought Mehdi Hassan is like another Chamuditha, Kalindu or Chathura. an arrogant crook he is.  This should be dubbed and telecasted in sinhala
This is peace
Thank you for directly interviewing such ruthless politicians❤️
And yet no one talked about the LTTE massacres
Now the Ranilist’s Buddhists will call Mehdi as a terrorist 😂😂. Ranil might’ve thought attending this interview might b similar to that of attending sirasa derana rupavahini etc 😂😂😂.. This man has zero class and statesmanship. Ranil can learn a lot from Indians external affairs minister Mr. Jaishanker. This man got smashed in front of the world.
Wow, is this an interview or just an interrogation? The journalist came in with clear hostility, throwing tense questions without even giving a 75 year old man a chance to respond. Is that what journalism is supposed to be? Even in a courtroom, a defendant gets a fair chance to speak.   I’m not defending RW and I know he’s far from a saint, but that doesn’t justify this level of unprofessionalism. The comments here say it all. Some people are celebrating just because they don’t like him, as if he’s the only corrupt politician here. The entire system is flawed, and even their favorites aren’t saints. I’d love to see this journalist invite AKD and treat him the same way. I wonder if they would still call it good journalism then.
19:20 :  බුදු බණ පදයක් සවන වැකේවා. බුදු ගුණ පමණක් සිතට නැගේවා. අවසන් වරට මගේ.. 🙏
My point of view,he (ranil) is the only fellow face  this situatoin,believe me if there aperson like Mr anura or Mr sajith dont know how they face whlie asking such quetions. On other hand ,am quastioning this is fedup asking,and joking also bulling fromer president regarding past things that may stimulate NGOS,but not a real situatoin in now srilank. I know have to study past things upto ertain extense,nevertheles v all  srilankans need   to get together find solutions getrid of our financial crsis.
Ranil is sri lankan foolish man😁  Super Al-jazeera❤
Everything is about politics to him yet he did nothing in politics. Everything is a joke for this so called former president.
If you are a true Sri Lankan, I urge you to watch from 39:13. Some individuals are trying to portray a distorted narrative about the Tamil community within Sri Lanka. Watch the former president’s response—respect to him.  Ranil Wickremesinghe is a true Sri Lankan leader. The LTTE was a brutal terrorist organization that caused immense suffering to all communities in Sri Lanka.
One of times i have seen an interview that one of Indian lady journalists was Stumbled with answer by president ranil wikramasingha.your a real journalist 😂
Irresponsible backbone less villain Ranil Wickramasighe. 👎
Childish old puppy of Mahinda.
නරුමයා ..
Useless, stupid, typical questions that are common to everyone. Arabic version of Camuditha. As the world knows, Al Jazeera is always one-sided; therefore, some world leaders refuse to talk to them, and some countries ban their telecasts. Those who sold the war and settled in the Western countries and politically illiterate demented donkeys in Sri Lanka enjoy this type of drama. Especially pro-tiger and anti-Mr. Wickramasinge TV channel in SL is providing big publicity. I am with Mr. Wickramasinghe to defend my country.
Lankan Lions Mr Wickramasinghe
This guy is a jocker, not a politition or President, blood thirst and power thirst old man. Shame on this type of politicians in Sri Lanka.
Always hoodwinked the people of sri lankan people while, being a dictator in his own party and destrying the party and brining it to mere one single member being elected.
ගිය සතියේ කිව්වා මිනිහට ෆෙරාරි ලයිසන් තයෙනවා කියලා 😂😂😂😂අද ⁣ඒක ඔප්පු කලා😂😂😂😂විලි නෑ ඕයි😂😂😂😂
Ranil is not  accountable for what rajapakses regime has done to the country . Why did al jazeera painting him like the bad guy ? What about LTTE killed innocent sinhalese  civilians over deacdes
Where is waduge . 😂
Dear ranil.i must pay my gratitude to bringing down the inflation and economic crisis during that time. But after u became the president u never took any steps on bringing down the corruption and u urself consumed lot of publics money for you and yourself .thats why u lost in the election . This speaker really imprints the majourity of sri lankans.
Thank you Al Jazeera.🎉 ❤
Those who viewed it from a debate perspective may have been excited by Mehdi Hasan's arrogant attitude. However, the wise in the room would have recognized President Wickremesinghe’s remarkable ability to put people in their place, exposing Mehdi as nothing more than an entertainer for the shallow minded. In the eyes of the intelligent, it was Mehdi who got thoroughly grilled. Well done, Mr. President! what a spectacle, defeating the tiger on its own turf!  The reforms introduced by President Wickremesinghe remain misunderstood by 70% of Sri Lankans due to a lack of exposure and education on governance, diplomacy, and influence. Meanwhile, the Rajapaksas continue to exploit this gap, committing crimes, erasing evidence in broad daylight, and leveraging Sri Lanka’s deeply ingrained socio-political structures. The country's ideological framework still bears traces of the feudal era, where hierarchical societal norms, patron-client relationships, and unwavering loyalty to powerful figures are remnants of a bygone system.
Ranil thought he could get respect outside Sri lanka. Instead they put him in his place. A failed leader bereft of morals.
It looks like the journalist is already prejudiced against Ranil. I don't see an unbiased interviewer here.
The interviewer doesn't even let Ranil complete his answers
I'm waiting for Al Jazeera to have Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview in the same fashion with a majority of Palestinians in the audience in UK. If Al Jazeera can do that then we will accept this program has been done in good faith.
Meanwhile Ranil: අනේ චමුදිත ඔයා කොච්චර අහින්සකයිද????
Sri lankan journalists are clowns compared to this journalist
26:23
Now do Mahinda Rajapaksa please!
මිනීමරුවාගෙන් ඇහුවම ඔයා මැරුවද කියල කොහොමත් කියන්නේ මමනම් මැරුවේ නෑ කියල තමයි... රනිල් රාජපක්ෂ හවුලෙන් ඔය වාර්තා ඔක්කොම යට ගහල සාක්ෂි විනාශ කරපු නිසා තමයි ඔය බය නැතුව අහන්නේ කෝ වාර්තාව පෙන්නන්න කියල...
@Aljazeera As a citizen of Sri Lanka,  I would like to request an extended version of this interview as "I guess" this does not cover all answers RW has given, and you'all have taken the answers which prove "your point" only. All these questions are mainly focused on just one topic which is very sensitive for all Sri Lankans. But this was biased to just one ethnicity, truth is everyone suffered during the subjected period regardless of the ethnicity. I'm not a RW or MR supporter, but Whatever is said and done, we live in peace in this country now. Let us be ❤ 🇱🇰
😂 Cringe 🫣
Kari balla
As a Sri Lankan i must say this journalism is not so different from Sri Lankans, just give the guy some time to answer
We all remember where Al Jazeera was at the time of the civil war. So can not expect more from a doctored interview which does not allow the interviewee to express himself!
This man was the prime minister and governed the country for 6 times. If he is a good leader, how come SL face this crisis after 6 episodes of his governance? 😂 He was the part of the problem.... The current government is far better than each and every government in the past.
Good job al jazeera well done ♥️ He is Very bad man in the sri lanka
Shame on you ranil (mr. Batalanda 😑)
However, I feel this is a unnecessary attempt to give fame to this buggar. Probably some one or some group are trying bring up or keep this buggar standby  as a alternative person for leadership in Srilanka. This buggar should be in the jail what he has done.
Excellent questions 👍✅  Well prepared for head to head this creepy, blacklisted, and corrupted former SL interim president Ranil Rajapassa 🤢  His allegations: 1. Batalanda murders and abductions. 2. Violation of SL constitution multiple times during his kakistocratic leadership style. 3. Illegal interference to SL Judicial system. 4.Illegal state officer’s appointment for example, former SL police IGP Deshabandu Thenakoon  - currently under warrant by criminal justice and hiding from SL CID/Police. 5. Negligence in Good Friday attack. 6. Central Bank of Sri Lanka sovereign bond financial theft. and many more
Hats of off to AlJazeera, all the questions are covered nicely, very good job Mahdi Hassan - from Sri Lanka
No no no no you you you yuou 😂...
Love you legend❤
Thanks Al Jazeera ❤️❤️❤️
Ranil is a murderer
යසයි පගයට 😂
Ranil is a beggar, a thief, and a beast.🤬
Very first time. He was interviewed about his crimes.
Who to blame for the crises? The answer is, "the citizens of Sri Lanka". Sinhalese says KOTA UDA. The country is on KOTA.
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a fraudulent and corrupt politician in Sri Lanka.
Man is so happy that he could pull out a stupid joke in the end as well, for him, he won the show in the end 🤡
People who are sensitive only to their own race, whether Sinhala or Tamil, are tribalistic.
Finally Ranil(kulla Fox) interviewed by smart and intelligence person.   This what Srilankan Sinhalease politician did bad things for long time... Now whole world know, whats this....
He was part of the economic and social collapse . And pulling out of bankrupcy is  a joke since him and the politicians created in the first place.
Some were waiting for this interview, they have posted this many times. 😅. Now I would like to ask from them , " දැන් සැප ද 😅😅😅
Horrible interviewer
Look at the way he is  insulting the Catholics Cardinal and the Bishops Conference...idiot  supported the Rajapakshas...Also reg. the batalanada.....why someone didnt ask  about the Jaffna Library,,,when he was in the parliament with JR the curse .....he is the one who mislead Tamil people...we too having relatives friends  how they attacked in 1983 to my own eyes i saw  looting burning killing disgraceful JRJ    R Premadasa and Ranils  Govnt......he is a dirty politician,,,,,,,,,,,now he wont allow the new Govt to do their work  and bring the country    up to some point....pulling out from the leg,,,,,,
NPP GOVT IS VERRY CHITING   SRILANKA PEOPLE

Mr . Wicramasingha is good leadership in Srilanka.. his verry good leader in Srilanka....
ම්ලේච්ඡයෙක් එක්ක කරන සාකච්ඡාවක් 😒
New ways of war crimes are being invented by EU and US using AI and robotics and drones, still these grand mothers and grand fathers questioning the civil war ended in 2009 which was Faught with ak-47 without even a single scope.
so called  Terorist funded  💩 spreading  news chanel 😂😂

Bro thought it's Hiru or Derana interview 😂🔥
Satisfied level 💯 Thank you Al Jazeera ❤
Arrogant Buster
This is a tight slap for the blind people in Srilanka who think Ranil Wikramasinghe is a great leader. The truth is he is a criminal.
Ranil, Gota, Mahinda, and other politicians should be held responsible for this crisis and the collapse of Sri Lanka.
Thanks al jazeera🎉
No way he quoted the Buddha.
Thank you seeing some one has courage in journalism is good
Well said Ranil.  This reporter has high dirty attitude .
ලපයා ඕකට ගියා නම් සිංහලෙන් තමයි කතා කරන්න වෙන්නේ උට 😂😂
We believe only AKD ❤❤NPP ❤❤Sri  Lanka ❤️❤️
Respect to journalist from sri lanka❤❤❤
This man kill lot of people Sri Lanka. very bad man.
very nice interview...Mr Ranil couldn't answer any questions.....
I saw this. Wow. This guy is more crooked than anyone I have seen.
Thank you Al Jazeera It was clearly proven that truth cannot be suppressed. ❤❤
Shout out to this great Journalist
His face says all🤣🤣
Ranil...❤
නියමයි කොල්ලෝ, දුන්නා ඇටි හැලෙනේන, ලංඩන් වලට ගිහින් ගහුවේ ❤.
Sitting down comedy .... sadly he abused my nation ...😅😢
I like to say that, LTTE is terrorist in my country. They done many thing to Srilankans and they had suiciders (murdering our people) No one talk about that.
Where is the report where is the report where is the report?
Ranil wicramasingha committed  suicide at al jazeera
Inner peace❤️
Finally the stupid exposed😂😂😂  thank you Mehdi hasan love from sri Lanka 🇱🇰 ❤❤❤
Ranul vicramasingha is best politician in srilanaka ❤
As a Sri Lankan Im so greatful to you for uncovering the truth behind this corrupt politician who is marked as responsible for mass scale murders and corruption such as central bank sri lanka robery
This shows to sri lankan journalists what is real journalism .most awaited interview as sri lankans coudnt get from sri lankan journalists .thanks Al jazeera.
thanx aljaseera
LTT terrorists are openly active in UK, Norway, and other western countries.
If this old man says that protesters killed a parliament member and burnt their houses, why didn't they arrest those who committed those crimes and prove it at the court. 😂 I was a protester and I was there when burnings took place, me and couple of my friends nearly saved ourselves and  our car from those who were engaging in burning and smashing things. Definitely it wasn't protesters but some hired thugs of Ranil Rajapaksas.
The day grandpa met a real journalist 😂😂
Before I had a chance to watch this programme there were comments made negatively about Ranil Wickramasinghe s performance at this interview. But having watched this I personally feel that it is the interviewer Mr Hassn Mehdi who made a poor show by losing his temper and who kept repeating himself over and over again. Just my opinion. Mr Wickramasinghe came on top.
Great questions from Al Jazeera.  Asking favourable questions and praising is what most politicians used to.. especially in Srilanka
ගහට ගහක් මොරටුවෙ හමුවේම
Where is the evidence  There is no report  I deny the allegations  Sri Lankan politicians are above the law  Justice will be served to the poor with interest some times  With the new government hoping things might change a little bit  But doubt the big fishes will ever be caught, like this joker
Sri Lankans who comment below don't understand the program's purpose. They want Ranil Wickremesinghe to acknowledge war crimes against the Sri Lankan Army. They want him to accept their claims of war crimes committed by our army. However, I salute Mr. Wickremesinghe for never blaming the Sri Lankan Army. The people on this program talk about civilians who died in Jaffna during the civil war, but none of them mention the innocent Sinhalese people who died in Colombo and other districts due to LTTE bombs, suicide attacks, bus bombs, knife attacks, and gunshots. For example, there was an incident at Maradana Railway Station where ten or more schoolboys were killed by a bomb in Colombo. No one is talking about their justice. Common Sri Lankans.
Respect AL Jazeera for showing the real face of Culprit ❤❤❤
Very undisciplined politician, disgusted
Sri lanka is my country and he is great leader i never ever seen... all srilankans stand in our country side our hero stand in our country... then we should stand with him....
🇱🇰🫡
Love The God Father of Sri Lanka..SriLankan pride.May triple Gems Protect our King Hon Ranil Wickramasinghe
Poor ranil....😂😂😂
He is not a buddist simply and lied that  too😂
Ranil please go to washroom😂😂😂😂
he is not Buddhist, but a christian.
Many things are obvious, yet still go unnoticed or neglected. The interview is hypocritical and immoral. The interviewer will soon lose his career, be depressed and may not live long, just because of his own nature. The interviewee just showed how he has survived so far, not just in politics. 🎉🎉🎉
Superb interview❤❤❤
Mane Tow president and Vice President Have to Answers many Years they were in our country politic Leaders Ranil wickramasinha  Mahinda Rajapksa there team knows how all this Happened in our country  Thank God NPP in Government now 🙏🏼
Ehell said Mr. Wickramasinghe. You spoke well.
Why are you interrupting
First hats off for the journalist, he collected all relevant details in details.....
Ferrari😂
If we SriLankans had such professional journerlists Renil wouldn't have been elected for four consecative times as the prime minister. Shame on our SriLankan journerlist who have no back bone😢😢😢
Ranil is bad examples leedar is aer not ruth man is are fox
Sri Lanka needs journalists like you Mehdi Hasan ❤🇱🇰 God bless you
Jornerlist 🎉🎉🎉
26:39 i dont know this guy anymore😂
Come on interviewer your hot headed in your interview we didn’t get to know the fair response of the interview
It just 49.27mnts? Where is the un-edited full program? This is going to another direction,as a Sri Lankan, We can understand what is going here..
this guy just made a press conference saying you guys edited the program, you guys should take action on it, he says it was a 2 hour program and you edited down make him look bad
Im a Sri lanka .... Thanks Al Jasira
The best interview I ever seen ❤👏
Bring rajapaksha
චමුදිතයත් මේක බලනවා ඇති නියපොතු කකා.

Thank you AL jasera
Ranil wikramasinghe had destroyed. Ranil is dealing politician
Madi we are very proud of you good luck god bless
Very excellent interview thanks Al Jazeera and Mehdi Hasan
Ranil is a JOKE 😅😅😅
Kudos for asking about batalanda
Ranil was nothing more than a lying, manipulative monopoly player and a dumb joker to most of the Sri Lankans for years. Thank you, Al Jasira, for showing that he is nothing but a dumb big mouth to the world. And people who say this were staged—I just have to say one thing: he was dumber than we thought because he walked right in to the trap and got cought. Stupid! Just Stupid!! And some people still say he is the only one who understands global politics in SL. What a joke!
Ferrari turning to cart 😂😂😂😂😂 17:08
mehdi is rude and irritating
As a Sri Lankan I am thankful to Al Jazeera for showing our so-called leader's hypocritical attitude and beaming arrogance, to the whole world
If you ask quesrions like this is Sri Lanka, Sudu Van Thamai
Mehdi retire pls before you become a shame to your family..what a cheap journalist...No wonder you got kicked out from MSNBC ..The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy just like MSNBC and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...What a waste of money they were surely thinking...hahaha what sore losers😝😝
Thank you Al Jazeera.......  Ranil wikramasinga was one of the main culprit. Thank you for questioning him ., Here in Srilanka the laws shouldn't work against him ., We're so glad that at least someone has the guts to question against him.
Ranil W clean bowled 🤣🤣 this is not talk with Chathura .. THIS IS NOT DERANA TV OR HIRU TV .. This Proper journalist ripping him apart 🤣 .. Mehdi Hassan has shamed him 🤣🤣.. GREAT TO SEE
Hats off for the interviewer
Ranil is like a wolf who does not care about the feelings or well-being of others. He has no concern for the people of Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, he is not alone in this, many politicians in the country behave in the same way. They are all primarily focused on consolidating their power and sacrificing the civilian population. (Just as they used it to gain power after the 2019- Easter attacks, the politicians after the LTTE war are using this LTTE war to consolidate their power and still few parties is using it to get re-elected in every election period, and they think that every Sri Lankan is indebted to them and they can do anything for our country). Ultimately, they will do anything to protect their power and treat their cronies without thinking twice.
Kaju seeya ( the zombie ) left...😂
well done Al-Jazeera and thank you ❤
Woah!!!! I’ve never felt this level of satisfaction from an interview before! Bravo to the journalist who bravely tried to expose the real culprits behind the downfall of my country. 🇱🇰

19:51 He was about to cry. 🤣🤣
Respect RW❤
All Jazeera midia terrorist with  L. T. T. E. Terrorist.
Respect for India for helping Sri Lanka in the most dire times..❤ 🇱🇰🤝🇮🇳
This ranil wikramsaingha is just an absolute idiot😂😂😂 He showed his class What an absolute clown As a sri lankan thank you hasan and al jazeera
Mehdi terribly lacks media interviewing skills.. this is what apparently annoyed Ranil. He was pretty calm and polite when he addressed the questions and allegations of the panel of experts and the audience. Not sure why Ranil is grilled so much like this and not the real perpetrators!!  The SL system is ethno centric and will never allow the crimes against minorities punished. Ranil knows it well and he doesn't bother too much about it.
Utter bs
Things are going on track
Why interview a retiree why not the current president 🙂
lmao
Wow whatcha journalist❤. Wish he could interview the ex presidents too
Mehndi ❤️
Nice interview  🤌
I thought mr. Ranil would get herat attack.
சிங்களம் எந்தப்பக்கம் முகத்த வைத்திருக்க போகுது?☹️
Please call mahinda rajapaksha too 😂
Can u please put on the unedited program. It will give a better understand on the view
This is the person who destroys our country , he directly or indirectly knows everything and there is his involvement surely.
Ranil murderer killed so many innocent teenagers.shame on you ranil.💩
Love u hasan and al jazeera You put this corrupt ranil wikramasingha in his place...😂😂😂 This man is an idiot
This is the main reason why we will always be a bankrupt third world country...
ரணில் அவர்கள் தன்னை ஒரு அரச குடும்ப அங்கத்தவராக நினைத்து இருந்தார். இறுதிக் காலத்தில் இப்படியான ஒரு கைதேர்ந்த மொழி வல்லுநர் கையில் அகப்பட்டு தன் இயலாமையைக் காட்டிவிடடார். Thank you Aljazeera journalist, you are a best professional journalist
Great interview. Ranil got humbled lmao
අපේ මාධ්‍ය අයියලාගේ ඇස් ඇරුනද මන්ද. ඉගන ගනිල්ලා මේකවත් බලල.
This is edited one, if you can publish entire discussion then only can understand what actually being discussed. Editing to get the advantages are not accepted at all
Full funded by USAID to overthrow governments. Shame on this main city stupid Colombo
Strong journalism and seasoned politician.
සීයාගේ ජාත්‍යන්තර සබදතා 😂
This interview is so weird 😢
With all this exposure about USAID  funds being allocated all over the world it's a miracle that Sri Lanka is still surviving. Geo politically India wants to keep us under it's thumb China wants our friendship and USA also wants a piece of the cake to thwart that alliance. Same as Ukraine those poor residents are bearing the full brunt of it all while the big powers want to assert it's fear of Putin. So properganda is making Zelensky a hero and Trump a villain. This is the true situation in the world. The human race now want to live in peace and harmony it's the big egotistical so called elected leaders who are taking decisions. Are they truly elected because campaigns have forced their opinions on us mere humans to believe and put them on pedestals. If you want to know who ruined Sri Lanka go delve into the depths to investigate the truth if you can unravel the web of hypocrisy without sitting on judgement
this mf is the reason for that 30y of tamil war.. everyone he killed in his massacre he pinned them on the tamil people. so dumb Sinhalese with no clue started attacking tamil epople (of course the first one to attack was also a mercenary of ranil) this man right here is the sole reason whole country is ruined, brother of my father is missing and my father was also in his prison, he say everything himself and how this mf was sitting there and watching, drinking vine while jvp comrades getting killed slowly.. and he made sure its slow af
@24:00 Did he say You're going off your head at this age ? >_< lol
What was your reaction?
This interviewer is using useless facts. The country was in anarchy what was he suppose to do let anarchy run free. Also the public voted for a party with zero governing experience. Imagine this happening smack in the middle of a crisis. Ranil did the right thing to stabilize the economy before having elections.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Aoooi ex president what ur doing here,,,u demolish our dignity.   See how this politician with media JUST imagine how this man resoponse during their power.
Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese majority country and it has always been like that. Immigrants can come but you cannot give a part of a country to them! You have to live in peace amongst everyone. The Tamil diaspora is spreading fall’s information all around the world. Aljazeera how much did they pay you to do this ?? Don’t finger another country’s politics just mind your own business and wait. There are much more brutalities happening all over the world, concentrate on those issues. You people just talk as if Sri Lankans are responsible for whatever happens in the world, even if you fart, it’s a Sri Lankan to blame. 😂🤣
Rnil chose gaslight.
කජු මුත්ත මැරෙන්න කලින් හරි හමන් මාද්‍යවේදියෙකුට සෙට් උනා..😂😂
He's  very careless about poor people in SL... and he let he's people to waste SL tax money so much!! Btw he's gay lol too much ego trippin
Al   Jazeera   Got  throne out  by  the  state  of  Israel   ☸✡  We  love  Israel
Hat's off MEDI HASSON SUPPER👍👍👍
Mad fox, Naril Wickramasinghe.
Having different political views is not a reason to hate people off the political field. The problem with Sri Lanka is the politicians either being related, family friends or share holders in corruption. Rani Wickramasingha is the nephew of former president JR. Mahinda Rajapaksha married Shiranthi Wickramasingha so that he could be related to Ranil and he got his son to mary Anurudha Rathwaththes daughter so that they would be related to former president Chandrika.
I don’t like him, and I don’t like seeing my country’s citizens being humiliated this much. However, we should face the truth. Regardless of whether the journalist conducted the interview well or poorly, my feeling is that RW tried to use the same tactics he did in Sri Lanka. But it wasn’t successful here.  And he is lying  Parlimentry votes (SLLP had 2/3rd majority in the parliment)  Ranil Wickremesinghe	           United National Party	              134	61.19% Dullas Alahapperuma	               Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna	82	37.44% Anura Kumara Dissanayake	    National People's Power	              3	  1.37%
to hold election  No money.  because  ranil let his staff to steel. this is very true
Journalism at its bets!🎉
Ranil murderer killed so many innocent teenagers.shame on you ranil
Thanks Al-jazeera for this Interview. RW deserves this.
Ranil is like cancer.he should never be trusted.He was here to protect the Rajafuckses he is nothing but a curse to the nation.
RW is used to bumming type politically appointed 🇱🇰Journists who then get the candidacy and become MP s I
Well said Mr. Ranil wickramasinghe. These people want to condemn the Srilanka because we srilankans eradicated the terrorism in srilanka. It is well proven by the comments of the panel.
Ranil is a murderer. Thank you Al jazeera .
Really  Really  very good  interview 👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌🇨🇦🇨🇦
He is behind all incidents
Very few leaders can take on journalists who feel they can outsmart the interviewee.   Ranil is definitely an egoistic man. But he won't let the International media bully him. Especially when they have organized the audience to laugh at him.
WoW! AL JAZEERA I DON' T have a word for it Excellent media❣❣ Specially the host owen the interview You nailed it. Please bring all foremer presidents Gotthaapaya, Mahida and Mihiri into the stage for an interview
10:51 😂
This man is like Chamuditha Samarawikrama. He does not allow the interviewee to answer
This is the difference between standard journalist & journalist with supportive behavior for the talking person..  For the moment, I thought this is real or fake in early moment of video.  That much of great questions are there.
Woow.  Thank you .. Real Journalist.  Plz add Sinhala and Tamil subtitle. Sri Lankan needs to see this. Please give rights to telecast this in Sri Lankan TV channels.  🙏
This man ( ranil ) is a shame to our country 🤮🤮🤮
As a Sri lankan i might say this is the top notch of journalism, hats off aljazeera and mehedirhassan 🎉 , this is healed me also 🙌
The real need behind the discussion is well understood when the panel is introduced. It is also well revealed by the Trump's disclosures of what many Europeans expected to happen in Srilanka. The so called NPP politicians becoming the ruling party in Srilanka and trying to sweep out the Rajapakshe's regimes from power.   So called UN and  every other agency tried to ruin the Srilanka. People in Srilanka feels what they did. Aljazeera including other agencies involvement in srilankan political propaganda is just embarrassing. It is crystal clear what these people need.
About the Easter Sunday Terrorist Bombings the the Attorny General Hon Mr Dapula De Livera has commented It seems there was a Grand  Conspiracy behind this  Why did The Cotabaya Adiminstration Transfered >70 CID Investigating officers of the then Govt who were investigating the Suicide Bombings inside the Churches Int Hotels  2 of the top and the best officers fled 🇱🇰to seek political Assylem  Mehidi as Usual is doing a good job👍
Mr.Batalanda
Thank you Al-Jazeera .
You should have done this interview with a poor folk in our country who is not telling lies.
We are not UNP But we always support Ranil in international
Awesome bombastic debate
Please allow the man to speak
Ranil didnt expect Hassan to question him the way he did. Good job. Ranil is one of the most cunning politicians in Sri Lanka.
This is very disapointing. They didnt allow enough time for Rw to give his answer the way he wanted. They just wanted "yes" or "no" answers. And brought some acquisitions against Rw based on a report which was bias to their agenda. Report not even tabled in to the parliament. They tried to mislead the viewers this time also. Be more independent pls. Allow the people to speak in a proper way.
In Sri Lanka our financial years run from 1st April to 31st March.
❤ BRAVO MEHDI.. YOU JUST STEPPED ON THE COCKROACH  😅
watch the part when RW smiles sarcastically (as usual) about Easter Sunday and Mehdi Hassan says “so many people have died and it is not funny”. Great Mr. Hassan 👍
The fox got trap in the mud
When Ranil’s face screen got ripped apart live on Al Jazeera—courtesy of Mehdi Hasan! That was some next-level political unmasking! Well done, Mehdi Hasan for holding Ranil accountable!  The politicians in power since 1972 have led Sri Lanka into crisis through corruption and self-interest. They fueled the war for their own gain, orchestrated financial scandals like the Central Bank robbery, and protected each other to stay in power. The Rajapaksa family must answer for the Easter Sunday attacks, and Ranil has shielded them—just as they saved him when he took over. Now, with the NPP in power, there’s finally hope for justice and real development. Investigations into past corruption, the Easter attacks and economic crimes must lead to accountability, and those responsible including Ranil and the Rajapaksas must face the law!
This is called as journalism. Hats off  to the journalist and Thank you al jazeera. I'm a pure Sri lankan. And I'm proud to be a Sri Lankan. But I'm really ashamed to accept that politicians like Ranil are also sri Lankans. Luckily now we have a government that thinks about people. I think that will be the turning point of my mother nation.🇱🇰
Several hundred people died due to Terrorists, worse under LTTE. No wonder this host was kicked out by MSNBC.
Ranil Wickremesinghe faced the interview like a champ with just one supporter and everyone against him, he still kept his cool! If that's not national leader material, I don't know what is!
Mehdi retire pls before you become a shame to your family..what a cheap journalist...The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄 Hats off to Ranil's bravery for single handedly bravely taking down tamil terrorist diaspora sponsored forum with their long term pay checked people like  frances harrison and mediated by Qatar human right violator royal family run Al jazeera channel... The dissapointment on frances harrisons face and the LTTE terrorist women next to her at the end of the interview says its all of what poor outcome they got against the plot of the whole LTTE money backed interview setup...what sore losers😝😝
What a level of jurnalist 😯😯 love you & keep it up fearless quection
LOL @ RANIL RAJAPAKSA
Thank you aljazeera.all Srilankan hope this situation.
Mehdi Hassan, Thank you so much for the wonderful Head to Head programme..
What is now required is not to blame previous  rulers  waste time doing noting. But to take remedial steps to lead the country winning the appreciation of the opponents as well.
Why is the interviewer interrupting him
About the Easter Sunday Terrorist Bombings the the Attorny General Hon Mr Dapula De Livera has commented It seems there was a Grand  Conspiracy behind this
JR, Premedasa, Wickramasingha and all the Rajapakshas are terrible people. Premadasa was an absolute demon. Even Chandrika shaded thugs and wasted a lot of tax money paid by poor suffering people. We are hoping that history would not repeat itself.  Please put pressure on the Thaleiban for their prevention of women's education.
Ranil's a massive NPD
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
He WAS "SELECTED" NOT ELECTED
Mehdi is a terrible journalist
Respect the reporter ❤
Great stuff AJ! Would love to see how you’d do the same with Obama, Bush and/or Blair  in that seat, being questioned in the same manner!
Excellent point about AG by Frances Harrison. AG's are the absolute worst.
Journalist with 🏀 s 🔥
Audience has some LTTE supporters. LTTE was a terrorist org.
අම්මෝ පරිනක නායක 😂
Just imagine How he frightened on his so-called political image after the interview he called upon local press for clear the damage part two drama 😂
we sri lankans all know .he is a criminal .
Ture sri Lankan love this interview 😅
People call him Mr Bean in Sri Lanka 😂
Ugh loved every second. Beautiful. Horrifying. Hilarious.
Hasan, you are a disgrace to all journalists!!!  You don't even know the basic principles of journalism.  Who is keeping your bank balance healthy?  It is time to go back to primary school!!!
දේශපාලනය කියන්නෙ රනිල් ගේ විනෝදාංශය . ඔහුගේ සෙල්ලම් පිට්ටනිය ශ්‍රී ලංකාවයි. ඉත්තන් මහජනතාවයි.  ⁣
This Filthy, Satanic, Evil, Corrupt, Sadistic, WEF Globalist, an absolute moron ruined Sri Lanka. Fukn Filthy Lier.
roasted
Journalist left with no opportunity. Thanks mr wickremesinghe
As a Srilankan, I am very much appreciated for this wonderful interview. For the first time in his life Ranil met a professional journalist. So happy to see cunning Ranil was left speechless. Well done journalist our hats off to you.
♥
Who broke the country ? - answer is Ranil and Rajapaksha.
Any other corrupted Srilankan politicians will run if they see mehdi hassan
What is this reporter doing here? What is his role in this meeting? His part is unclear.🤔
Most of the missing Tamils are terrorists and burried after they got killed. It was a war.
GEORGE SOROS / USAID is to be BLAMED big big time for ‘funding’ chaos and consequent crisis.

This will not make anyone vote for him
This is called "AVLO THAN MUDCHI UTTINGA POGA" moment 😂😂
Well done aljazeera ❤
Ranil got messed up you can't fool the people all the time...
Ranil failed to do his homework.
2:32
මහින්දගෙ උපන්දිනේට යන එක වැරදී....  මහින්දව ,චන්ද්‍රිකාව,සිරිසේනව ජනාධිපති කරන්න ගෙයින් ගෙට ගිහින් රට කාපු එක හොඳයි😂😂   අපේ රටේ බයි-කයි බූරුවන්ගෙ මතය🤪
Ranil and mahinda rajapaksha very very bad politics central bank robbery  we don't like dogs
It is a joke that EU and UK talk about human rights. They both cracked down protestors
What embarrassment on the world stage. This phony politician showed his true colors with his arrogant attitude and constant lies. Sri Lankan journalists should learn to ask politicians  tough questions and not play with softball questions. Kudos to this host for making this buffoon miserable.
sjb, unp, slpp all these parties destroyed the country and is the reason sri lanka is in this state
PONIL LEFT😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who's next ?
Thank you so much al Jazeera. I'm Sri Lanka
Ranil Blasted AL Jazeera  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It is utterly disgraceful to witness RW’s feeble, evasive responses — especially when confronted with the tragic loss of innocent lives under his rule. His appalling mishandling of this interview is yet another brutal reminder of the vicious cycle that has plagued Sri Lanka for decades — where presidents, prime ministers, and their cronies looted the nation’s wealth through rampant corruption while crushing the hopes of its citizens. Let me be clear — President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his government must not be burdened with the crimes of their predecessors. If these disgraced former leaders and their sycophants have even a shred of conscience, they must abandon their conspiracies and, for once, put the nation’s recovery before their own deceitful ambitions.
"Finally, Ranil faces a real journalist! This is what investigative journalism looks like—something Sri Lanka desperately lacks. RW is a disgrace to the country, indifferent to accountability and playing with innocent lives. His megalomania is appalling; he belongs in the archives, not in the media spotlight.  The whole world knows about the Rajapaksa-Wickremesinghe alliance. And for those praising his 'international recognition,' like Hirunika Premachandra, they should watch the full interview 😂  Disgraceful. Yet, some fools still want him back in power!"😮

Very very thanks Aljazeera❤❤
Ranil is akiller
This man doesn't care people but only his political position. He spent people money while the country going down economically. He is a big friend of Mahinda. He has rights to be. When it comes to corruption they are all friends. He is slipping.
The Root causes in Sri Lankan economic problems long civil war. I'm one of the expected men to share with you, those who are behind thieves are Indian politics they are coveted in our country and  nation's.because Indian RAW controlling through EVIL politics, corruption, bondages, bribes, we may need the Positive changes, we need to discern who are the enemies and who's the friends.take a serious Actions for your country and don't TRUST anyone ! GOD may protects you and blesses you..!!!
Ranil met a drunken hooligans
Thank you for questioning him like this Mehdi ❤ Much respect to you 👏
This is a cheap journlism. This is not an interview, it was interrogation,. This al jazeera sucks LTTE hooligans, that is the reason they are feeded by israel in daily basis. If a responsible media, teach ur low paid workers some discpline. This is like screaming and shouting at sunday market  disgusting
As a Buddhist in Sri Lanka, we all know that he directly supported the attack on that church and a mastermind behind  illegal activities in Batalanda.  We love our Christians in Sri Lanka. That's why we defeated him.
To me this is a one sided setup. Look at all the questions by audience, all of them are only about Tamil conflict and each question was cheered!! Shame on you Al Jazeera..
Ranil is talking about democracy. But he violated and tried to violate the constitution.  He is not providing logical or appropriate answers. He is trying to run away from the questions.
superd journalist

You have a deep jealousy towards Christians. 😂
Poor Journalism. Asking stupid questions about past? Full of Nonsense. this leader is a world class leader who lives in Sri Lanka. And he has bring lot of productive things to country like Sri Lanka even in a crisis. These stupid Journalist like to keep this beautiful country like third class people. Even some pig headed people in this country cannot understand because of their ego. And also eu parliament member is right no point of asking questions that should ask from Rajapaksha.
He is one of the elites who enjoyed insurmountable benefits from the taxes of the innocent people. A crook himself.
Well done, Al jazzera🎉🎉

Respect Ranil W, ❤
Ranil and rajapaksha are both friends and they did nothing to stop a war they just to the glory when a general sarath fonseaka ended it  Ranils nick name in srilanka is bank theif he thing he is smart but he stupid and mastermind behind the corruption in srilanka   And also most of the srilankans are stupid becuase in his rule people beleived a thing called damika syrup which would cure corono do u know who promoted it srilankan media and this guy and millions of people bought into it even
முல்லி வாய்கால் வாய்க்கால் is not English 😂
Allow the president to talk please.
This guy genocide so many Tamil people
Just check USAID players here - who wanted chaos in countries like SL. These media outlets just stage shows hiding the truth
"Was the journalist who questioned Ranil Wickremesinghe on Al Jazeera a terrorist or an extremist?"
Huge salute to the real reporter on behalf of millions of people! They always controlled the media for decades and decades. This is a real solid questions 😊😊 Thank you ❤
The One and Only Best Srilankan Educated President Mr Ranil Wikramasingha 👏🏾
Srilankan tamil community now watching "Kavan" Movie again 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️  Thanks Aljazeera!!! Thanks Mehdi ❤️

Im a sri lankan.yes peoples are in our country know ranil is the God Father and he know how to skip questions verry well
For the last 76 years these politicians had ruined this beautiful country..every time they said is they are the pioneers in politics..and after 76 years this country have become a bankrupt country....
I absolutely loath these arrogant, dumb politicians. These guys committed crimes against average Sri Lankans (War and financial) with impunity for far too long.
දැන් මේකට පන යනකම් බැනල තියනවනේ. මේ විදියට අනුරගෙන් අහුවෙත් උත්තර දේවිද..?
Let the old man speak lol questions are good but let him answer Aljazeera propaganda machine
Ranil tried to runaway from Medhi. Then he tried to hide behind Buddha. This is what he do at the parliament too. He tried to deal the way he deal with Sri Lankan media.  Great work Al Jazeera exposing this looser.

We don't need your journalists nosing in on our country's matters, we will take care of them internally. Audience, panel and reporter are all terrorist supporters as it seems by the questions
Respect the journalist ❤️‍🔥
Well Done Reporter We Sri Lankan Love You This Man Is The Reason For Everything now going On in Sri Lanka
This RW is man with no sense , true this man killed lot of youths in Batalanda in front of him . This man has some metal disorder
Ranil is murderer.sri lanka have many avidence
This truly show cases how incompetent this clown is!! No wonder Lanka was continuously struggling to develop!
This man here single handedly responsible for murdering thousands of innocent young men and women in the country back in 80's and 90's and murdered his own political party members too. Unfortunately no actions were taken and had the power in 2105-2019 era with his corrupt party members and loss the countries billions of dollars for his intentions. Then again Rajapaksha's handed him the power in order to stay alive in the country and this man again started his corrupt political agendas but people throw him away last year. He is a pure example of a cunning murderess thief who is still alive to create chaos in the country. This man along with his best buddy rajapaksha still creating chaos in the politics with their third class hound dogs. Hope this man leave this planet soon along with his buddy so the country can breath some fresh air after some long decades.
This Journalist tries to possession his opinion rather than interviewing the interviewee.
Ranil faced the challenge greatly.
I’m glad that this corrupter finally met a real journalist ❤
He was behaved as a arrogant clown infront of whole audience , plus  he did the same way in two years to srilankan people . That was the real reaon he was not elected as president by the people of Sri Lanka.
These should ask from current government before they leave. After leave no accountable. Mr Wickramasigne we must praise at least he bought country back.
❤ excellent answers sir... thank you Mr. Wickramadingha.
Thank you Al - Jazeera!❤
🇱🇰   🇱🇰   🙏💪 Our ex-president Ranil Wickramasinghe ❤ bravely faced Al Jazeera's unfair questions 💪🇱🇰
"I've been in politics before you were born" that's exactly how crooks defend themselves. If someone still calls him a genius, well, it's time to study what he's actually done. As Sri Lankans, we know his past too well. He's not the democratic icon he pretends to be.. just another clown hiding behind politics.
Comparing with gaza nothing happened in our country
Hon Ranil wickramasingha 🎉 our president.💪🏻❤. we love our country.most beautiful country in the world.
Position is Fox .Ranil is King of Fox
Ranil is not a hero.. He is such a clown
Jvp මිනීමැරුම්,දේපොල විනාස කිරීම්, චන්ද වර්ජනවලට බලපෑම් කිරීම් ගැන...  අනුරගෙන් ඔය පුටුවෙ තියල ඇහුවනම් කොහොමද😂
Ask him Why he spent millions of public money on his Presidential Election.😢😢😢😢
😂
Bottom line They are still suffering of losing terrorists.
Well done Al jazeera and hats off for the reporter. I think someone had to wash the chair. 😂
RW is Mr.Bean version of Sri Lanka😁😁
Wondering why single Sri Lankan journalists unable to had an interview like this ….🤔  Respect Mehdi
Elderly senile people must know when to quit.
Hats off international media journalist of Al juseera,,Srilankan former president Ranil wickramasinghe is a not human ,fully brutal and cunning fellow ,,like a fox ,,
Seems like another cheap interviewer showing his true propaganda colours. 🤮
14:51-14:55 Ranils hand is shaking. 😅
Whatever said and done Ranil is a great Leader and our ungrateful Sri Lankans still not realised how the country has gone bankrupt? He came forward and did a great service. Also our Sri Lankans always very famous to attack the people who can do something and now they brought useless set of idiots, no experience and also not knowledge enough to rule the country and not a hum sound against them. Very sad and thoroughly disgusting.
Hats off to al jazeera.
🤣🤣
Good One 👏👏
The interview was 2hrs but they cut it down for 1hrs😂, just adding the parts were they like.  Basically what the BBC did to Andrew tate.Shame people are too stupid to understand
It seems that people who funded Aragalaya wanted to question Ranil and made some stupid questions and gave the order to the Aljazeera.😂😂😂😂
Well done mehdi you done a fabulous job  this kind of journalist need to our country  (lack of quality journalists in srilanka 🤦‍♀️😿)
Upload the full video of the interview and learn some manners
මල්ලි මල්ලි මේ අපි ඕවට නෑ 🐸
Great president Mr Ranil Wickramasingha❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are a very disrespectful journalist. Shame on you. And how dare you talk about the war crimes that have been done by Sri Lankan army they were trying to protect all the Sri Lankan people not just Sinhalese people. So just like you people are saying is it a crime to protect our country from terrorist. So literary you are telling that it is okay for terrorist to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people by slaughter and suicide bombers they were just civilians they weren't in part of any terrorist attacks, and when we try to defend and our country from those blood thirsty terrorist all of a sudden it becomes a war crime. So, shame on you all of the people who accusing against my country.  Everyone is talking about how our Sri Lankan government remove all the protestors at the Galle face, why aren't we talk about how President Trump removes all the people who try to take down capitol building of USA. Thank you for former president Wickramasinghe for answering those dumb questions of a dumb journalist.
Ranil a disgrace to Sri Lanka hope that he will never see in our parliament
Meanwhile, the IGP of Sri Lanka, whom Ranil appointed illegally, is on the run after allegations of open fire and murder.
Not uploaded full vedio, Al Jazeera edit this vedio like a eww
Accountability given by election.
This man thinks he is the center of universe. He is trying to justify the means .No use Man U are a vegetable now.
Hats off to the journalist❤️. This is what all Sri Lankans wants to ask from him
සීයට හත්පොලේ ගූ හැත්තෑවක් ගාගෙන 😂 මේ සීයට වදින එවුන් තාමත් ඉන්නව ලංකාවෙ
No one questions politicians like this in Sri Lanka. Respect
Thanks 🙏 for aljazeera
U r such a shameless fellow and it is disgraceful to the nation. The whole world has watched your behaviour. Anyway u r not an elected president or prime minister each and every time with the blessing lessing of people. Every time u played the games and became either primer or at last president.  U r such a dirty character rejected by people each and every time. At least now also please refrain from playing games and retire from all types of politics and stay home.
This interview showed both the strengths and weaknesses of RW.  During his tenure as PM to Chandrika, he rescued the economy and split the LTTE in two.  I think, had he won the Presidential election he would have split the LTTE further and we may not have descended in to that final war which killed so many and made the Rajapakses national heroes.   I think he got ambushed by the Tamil Diaspora in this interview regarding the atrocities that occurred during the war, which were not in his control.    I also think that Prabakaran had an opportunity to negotiate a settlement with RW and avoid the war, but he opted for war instead and handed power to the Rajapakes though the election boycott.   RW lost by just 180,786 votes! This would have been a very different county had he won.   Where RW fails is in his classist approach to politics, in which he is quite willing to enact violence on the people to hold the colonial structures that have kept 80% of the population in poverty.   Be it Batalanda or using the police to evict the Aragalaya protestors, RW has shown over and over again a destain for the common man and a prerogative to hold the old colonial status quo. And that has compromised the man.   1. He protected the Rajapakes during Yahapalana 2. He allowed his henchmen to plunder the Central Bank and ETF, everything.  3. He put the country in to austerity which put the burden of payment on the poor over the rich ( He did this during Yahapalana and during his tenure as President) 4. He appointed a Compromised IGP  5. He tried to split the Supreme Court by trying to appoint Nissanka Bandula Karunarathna 6. He misused the PTA and maintained authoritarian acts such as the Bureau of Rehabilitation Act  These are all the actions of a man who is trying to hold a system that no longer works for the majority of this country.  He is the oligarchs President and that’s why he failed and kept failing.
"Bunch Of Muppets Lead By Joker" Ranil Is Dying There Man 😂
We are nation promote entrepreneur. Many of our people working in big places similar to Nassa.  Currently during Mr gotabaya new generation asked for convince due to pandemic which our legal system not provided. Only thing Mr Wickramasigne can do bring economy to better level so citizens can live better.
Hats off to Mehdi that was insane!  Ranil is a Criminal!
நன்றி அல்யஷீரா. சுயரூபத்தை வெளிப்படுத்தியதற்கு🙏
Ranil is  crying 😂hooooo
This old fox has got exposed . The listeners have the brains Mr.Ranil Rajapaksha.  Sorry state of greedy Ranil.
Let me say this: 1) Listeners wants to listen to the former president, not the interviewer 2) Interviewer ask questions, but do not give Mr. Wickremesinghe the chance to answer 3) The journalists only tactic here is "interrupting,' thus avoiding a clear answer from Wickremesinghe 4) When the journalist get cornered he immediately goes into the audience to get support from 'setup' questions 5) The journalist was 'stumped' by Wickremesinghe, when raised the question of 'Batalanda'. Without first source information, you don't ask 'questions' 6) From Question 1 it was evident the reporter was up for something 7.) Reporter also does not know wickremesinghe's past. He is the 'Best Reformer' Sri Lanka had and also the one who made and still making a concerted effort to bring in 'Reconciliation'.  8) Reporter asked few questions pertaining to issues occured when Rajapaksa was in power and not him.             Let me say here, an argument cannot be won by "Interrupting.' while Wickremesinghe
The British government should give money back for the occupation they did before the independence and the stolen money is with the British government
-70% to -1.3%..
20:04 Reporter : It's not that funny🫢 FormerPresident- 😬😬  😂😂
Thank you Aljazeera for catching him off guard! 😂
Omg Bro Got Nothing To Say " No Contest, No Contest 😂"
Hi, hi, Ranil  suffer  Loose motion,   wear  pampas,
Let the Sri Lankan Political "Fox" to learn his lessons. Thank you Mehdi Hasan. Good Job...  Many Sri Sri Lankan still thinks he is the man and he knows everything. No wonder what happen to this country...
This interviewer is not a interviewer, he should’ve said the news without the other man actually being there if he was gonna cut him off at every point, saying things like “no we don’t have time for your answers”???. These are serious issues that we would’ve liked to hear Ranils answers to, wrong or not. This is a bad interview. Actually don’t call it an interview cuz it’s not.
I am very excited to see this full interview. Because both are head-to-head
උද්දමනයෙන් ලෝකෙ 2 වෙද්දි, සෘණ අගයකට ගෙනාපු. තෙල් ගේන්න සල්ලි නැති රටක ඩොලර් බිලියන 6.3 ක සංචිත ඉතුරු කරල ගිය, උපතින්ම ප්‍රභූ පරම්පරාවක සහ ජනප්‍රිය පාසලක නිසා හීනමානය පිරුණ පිරිසකගෙ ඇරියස් වලට ගොදුරු වෙලාරටට අහිමි  වටිනා මිනිසෙක්
So journalists only ask questions and don't need answers because they already know the answer then why even ask questions? If Ranil apologies or say something good maiing him look like a good person, Mehdi interrupts him. This is what they say about not trusting everything you see. This is the stupidest interview I have ever seen. And just shifting the blame from the Rajapaksas to Ranil.
I've worked with Ranil Wickremasinghe when he was the Opposition Leader and Prime Minister. He is a dictator. He must have know not all journalists are naive and ask as he wishes. He tried but he couldn't do it better. He protected Rajapaksas. It's fact.
Migrant boys of south Asian immigrants have no respect to elders ..what a rude bloke this reporter is😒😒
Whatever said and done Ranil is a great Leader and our ungrateful Sri Lankans still not realised how the country has gone bankrupt?
Ranil is a mad leader. We never vote that fool guy. But LTTE Tigers are terrorists. Listed terrorists.
He used buddhas story to hide his faults. He has no right to use  buddhas quote cover his faults .One of the cunning politicians in Sri Lanka. Instead of answering, he will raise another question out of the question raised.
After this , Srilankans will suggest to interview rajapakshas.
The primary reason for the breakdown of harmony between the Sinhalese and Tamil people in Sri Lanka is neighboring India. The Tamil people living in the state of Tamil Nadu have historically desired a separate country for themselves. Have they ever wanted to identify themselves as Indians? They have always identified themselves as being from Tamil Nadu. To prevent Tamil Nadu from becoming a separate state, India cunningly attempted to convince them that Sri Lanka was their rightful homeland. This led to the emergence of the LTTE organization, which killed thousands of innocent civilians from both nationalities. The cruelty of the LTTE can be seen in incidents like the Aranthalawa massacre, which you can search for more details. The LTTE was often more brutal than the Sinhalese extremists.
👍👍👍
Rajapaksha regime and Ranil gang are responsible for the crisis of Sri Lanka.
One of the few people responsible for the crisis in Sri Lanka.  Not only that, he protected criminals in his time.  JR Jayawardena, R Premadasa presidents brought the underworld to politics and created Tamil Sinhala ethnic conflict.  He played a leading role in it.
No Srilankan journalist has the courage to ask questions like this. This is true professional journalism.
In first place Ranil should have not participated in programme. The Conductor of the programme is headstrong mad man.
Respect the jurnerlist.. No any unavailable questions. Will need justice for innocent people those who were killed in Easter attacks and batalan...😢
Ranil behavior like Mr.Been 😂
Well done reporter Respect you
At this point i felt Ranil needed a translator..
Sinhala ideology exposed running from accountability 😂
As inhabitants of our country, we admire Mr Wickramasingha for stepping forward and taking control of the situation at a critical time for the country and regular civilians. Ordinary citizens were in confusion while the country's security was at a critical point, when so-called protests became violent. The country was faced with being in the hands of nobody. We must be grateful to security forces for taking command of the situation and risking their lives. This is what the average citizen would expect. That was not a peaceful protest; it was a violent one that threatened innocent residents' lives, property, and the country's integrity.   The interviewer doesn't seem to desire a detailed response. He appears more intent on cornering Mr. Wickramasingha instead.  And maybe work for someone in a reputable setting?

❤Good Job Aljazeera❤🇱🇰 If Ranil is still president of Srilanka, these reporters including Mehdi's will taken to Batalanda by him. Like  late 80"s era.
Yes he is corrupted and all the politicians are , but still Tamils wants part of Sri Lanka . Ask who is LTTE leader ? What he did to Sinhalese community? How he killed monks and near villages families including kids , child soldiers, suicide bomb attacks.. talk to people in northeast how they were treated due to cast of Tamil people. Tamils or Sinhalese do not ask for war it’s only political leaders including LTTE want the war because it’s an incomes of never ending.
11:29 : hey journalist at Al Jazeera. Just learn the culture of Sri Lanka first
Without back bone sri lankan reporters never questioning such a way. Thanks very much Al jazeera for questioning such a merderer.

As a sri lankan, i'm thanking ALJazeera  and especially to this journalist for revealing every corrupted action of this former president,  If this journalist was in sri lankan probably he would've been kidnapped and murdered before the dawn of the next day, that's how those corrupted politicians worked in sri lanka,  there are tons of corrupted politicians in sri lanka, and i'm humbly request Al Jazeera and international media to bring them and question, this world must know what was happing in Sri Lanka for decades. I'm posting this comment from a fake email account because even though these corrupted politicians are not ruling the country, we're still afraid to say the truth revealing ourselves, there was no democracy in the past. Journalists were murdered like animals.  So thank you so much Al Jazeera. We really appreciate you.
Mamma mia... Non ce parole per spiagare la felicita. Bravo..Bravo..Bravo
Best interview Al Jazeera.. Thank you..👍
Love you Al jazeera. ❤
Mehdi , you are a hero ❤❤
I believe he never faced a real journalist 😂.  Excellent questions.
Ohh our poor සීයා 😂
Ranil is a murderer, thanks Al Jazeera for opening the eyes of the world 😊
Exposed
😂❤ respect broo..
Srilanka fomer president Ranil wickramasinghe  is very cunning and brutal beast,,he always telling  lies to the media and doing very currpeted things, dont believe his words,,he is lier and murderer about 80,000  people killed by his order ,,he hides every evidence of his all victims all the times,,I urge every organizations( for the justice ) in the world to punish Ranil wickramasinghe for the sake of god,,today also he is misleading our poor country ,,we are hopeless and helpless ,,please help us for the sake of justice ,,,thanks
I salute the interviewer as he was fantastic! Asking the most crucial and unbelievable happenings in Sri Lanka under these misguided, in  efficient governments up to now!!! Ranil was a failed leader although he had experience in that profession but did nothing at all! AG was appointed by Ranil so as most of the higher ups in the police, Army Navy etc, etc.He was mainly looking after the Rajapakse’s and he made sure nothing would happen to any of these corrupt politicians under him!!! Batalanda was one of his doings and killed  more than 1000 young people I would say, the number will be more, Thanks to our incredible, intelligent, people for making the biggest change, a system change what ever you call, right now the country is heading the correct way! Malimawata jayen Jayawewa!!
කොටි ගුලකට අහුවෙලා  these people work for Tamil tigers
In Sri Lanka some Of them think Ranil save the country but he made crisis worse   Excellent job Al Jazeera
Ranil is an awful politician and is there for a career and not the people. The panel however is distinctly one sided when it comes to war crimes. Atrocities committed by the terrorist LTTE group are never mentioned.
Check his facial expressions when he heard the name Vincent Fernando.... Cant hide the guilt
Jolly Siya can't handle it. 🤡
Al Jazeera 👌👌👌👌👌
Al Jazeera 👌👌👌👌👌
They used their power to secure their dropping power. See the way he speaks you. It confirms his attitudes
Good jobs  Alzeera
wow just wow
I dont support Ranil, nor any other politicians. But I think Al Jazeera just wanted to get Ranil on stage, and accuse Sri Lanka for War Crimes and get international attention back on the civil war. Look here, the Sri Lankan Tamils in the country know what really happened, the Nothern Humanitarian operations, and also they don't want any war or Tamil states. But those Tamil diaspora in UK and India, Canada still wants Tamil states and still trying. Gen. Shavendra Silva was the Commander of 58th Division, which carried out so many operations including humanitarian. The SL Army liberated the civilians forcefully held by the LTTE, you can see those videos still if u search as Nothern Humanitarian operation. Civilians may have been killed as it was a civil war, but they were not targetted by the Army, in fact they werw liberated by the Army when LTTE was forcefully holding the Tamil civilians as shields.
Well Done Al-Jazeera! ❤️❤️❤️
Mehedi act like Gotabaya era not exited. Whole economy failure because of his mad decision that led to this state
Ranil Rocked😂 Al jazeera Shoked😮
Look at Ranil's arrogant style of speaking. He doesn't even look the journalist in the face when speaking. Ranil is an arrogant, incompetent leader. He cannot understand people's feelings. The people of Sri Lanka know him very well.
What a shame.. Mr ex President Ranil act Like a Child..😅 but some points I disagree. Specially war crimes.. SL army did well.
Very irresponsible interview. Host doesn't have enough experience to interview such a experienced politician. He doesn't allow to give the full explanation.
Karma is powerful
Mehdi met biggest Con artist you can find anywhere on the world. I am glad that Sri Lankan had the courage to break free from the fear loop. Watch us. We are determined to become a developped nation. We understand how bad our current circumstances are, but dont you forget how hard is our fighting spirit.
This interview is spot on. Thankyou aljazeera
Oh my god he’s stammering like crazy
Let me tell you something, let me tell you something....
Ranil Rajapaksha's is a very big liar, criminal, rogue central bank money laundering with his friend from Singapore ,murdered in batalanda, he should be in jail, but very soon he will be in jail.
This bloak is guilty as buggery. He should be tried in Hague for war crimes and killings.
This is 2 hrs interview. But Algezera edited most of good discussions and put some short clip.
Ranil continuously interrupting the  journalist by repeating no no no three times…how uncanny
Thank you so much 💓 al jazeera
lol not in respect of any of this group of interview , in literally people in north are in peace  now , under the fact the recent election we can see non of these are concerns . in 2009 before that civil war  people in north were in stress .speaking financial prior 2009 were paying 4 $ per liter of fuel  in 2009!!!, food were rations even though given by the UN . so all the people out there right or left this is bias to create unnecessary issues that country in peace.
This journalist should receive the respect of the people who have suffered for 70 years for exposing the politician who caused the destruction of Sri Lanka.
The West will seek publicity for their ally, who has been ostracized by the people. No one here will punish the murders committed by America, Israel, Britain, Rajapaksa, Gotabaya, Ranil. This is a web of global political conspiracy.
UK put this guy in check well done ✅ 👏👏 this interview was well needed im so happy
As a Sri Lankan I love this interview. But I am so sick and tired of UK/USA journalists throwing UN/Amnesty International “stats” in our face as if the global west hasn’t committed worse crimes throughout the Middle East and other smaller nations
Thank you very much Al Jazeera host ❤❤ such a shame this joker 🃏 in our country
milanhiththatiya
Thank you Al-Jazeera not a single TV channel will interview Sri Lanka politicians this way to find out the truth of a dirty violated democracy for the last 46 years since JR came to power.
❤❤
Thank you Mehdi❤ You’re just brilliant. ❤ from sri lanka

Whats the language he is using ..he is not even capable of talking to a journalist 😂😂😂 whata shame wickramasingha 😂😂
සීයාගේ ගැම්ම   මාලිමාවෙ වෙනකෙනෙක් ඉන්නවද
Karma return 🙏
Ranil, the Comedian of the era
As a Sri Lankan, I Love this interview ❤ hats off to you, Mehdi sir
Did that dude really say "almost Trumpian"?? He lost all his credibility right then and there. What a clown!!
Ranil is finally facing a real journalist for the first time. Kudos to Mehdi and his team for this much-needed interview that many of us have been waiting for. If you could get Rajapaksa on one of your episodes, we could die in peace ✌️.
First I should say I'm not a Fan of Ranil. I see a lot of Sri Lankans happy to see Ranil in hot water. But pls see the big picture. It was a 2hr interview. They only put 50mins of what they want. Second I saw a lot of LTTE sympathises and failing to call a banned terrorist organisation and calling it a civil war. Third is whatever your interview style is give a chance to answer rather than making your own statements. I feel there was an agenda rather than bring the facts out.
Well done Al Jazeera...
Ranil handle it very well. And mehedi Hassan is a terrorist loving pathetic journalist we all knows avout that 😂😂😂😂
He had   demonstrated again what a coward he is
😢too painful to watch. What was RW trying to achieve?
Ultimately RW faced real journalist
You all think Queen victoria will be questioned the same way about the massacres and genocides committed all around the world if she was here (at least the british government)?
The best program. Sri Lankan journalists should learn from this gentleman.
It’s the brutal political cartel that Sri  Lanka ruled so many years. Two main parties scratched their backs. No one became guilty. Top positions of Government institutions, commissions were also appointed by them. That’s why people voted a complete new setup this time and keep on questioning, pushing them also to bring the justice. This country needs to get out of deep state and establish law and order.
The interviewer is very bad he doesn’t allow Ranil to finish a statement.
None of you is getting what Ranil does here. He's enjoying the show. He has been a die hard fan of these bombarding talk shows and all he wanted is to feature in it with his style. The way he wrapped up tells you the story. What a Casanova !!
Biased tamil terrorism propaganda
කොටි මාධ්‍යවේදියෝ ටිකක් රනිල්ගෙන් ප්‍රශ්න අහනවා.සරලයි❤
Runil the clown is the saviour for Rajapaksha currupts. He is a mental case.
Great journalism great questions free tamil eelam
Ranil, MR,GOTA, and the gang are playing a game and living unharmed.
Meidi Hasaan does a Ban ki Moon/Darusman, Sooka on Ranil with z panel consisting of bias BBC reporter FH & another lady from the ethnic minority community in SL. It  appears MH was hijacked and fed punnack to floor RW. Question from the floor accompanying loud cheers was an indication of the type of audience.  Never a fan of RW, yet must appreciate how RW did the Muhamed Ali.  Cornered by the panel & the audience, hustled by MH, he RW floated like a butterfly and stung like a Bee. Meidhi Hassan, overlooked to invite Lord Naseby to the panel. A trap and a hidden agenda. Into the Holy Month of Ramadan, MH will have (30) days to best his chest and say Mea Culpa.
Well done Mehdi! Even though I don't agree on your views on Hamas and Palastine, you did well against this joker who hailed as the father of democracy in Sri Lanka. 😅
Necessary questions were asked. But the journalist should also have the patience and maintain a mature behaviour to let the other person to talk whether he likes the answer or not.
Good interview but interviewer should let the invited talk or it looks like an angry kid talking over the guest, We already know the facts you said, I mainly wanted to see what the answer would be for each question but you kept talking over him 😩😩😩. Edit : second half is amazing thank you interviewer
Thank you al jazeera  ❤ as a young regeneration of Sri Lanka, now we understand how past political views play with our future
Great interview ❤
You didnt allow to let down our county even for a single second  thank you mr president for holding our banners❤
Well-crafted questions for Mr. Ranil. For the first time, I saw him struggle to handle such a talented journalist. He attempted his usual tactics on camera, but Mr. Mahdi outmaneuvered him and won the hearts of young Sri Lankans. Congratulations to Al Jazeera for its service to the nation—we look forward to seeing Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa in a head-to-head interview with Mehdi Hasan. Love from srilanka 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
Well done Mehdi  great job, but you forgot to ask about why this clown was laughing at people who died from that devastating easter attack. Plus their party stated that they were knowing something will happen but never expected this much big attack.
Ranil Wickremasinghe is an old moulded politician with only his personal ambitions. He promised the Catholics of Sri Lanka that when he becomes President he will get Scotland Yard to investigate the Easter Sunday attacks. Once he became president he refused to get the Scotland Yard to investigate because he wanted to protect the Rajapaksas. This is the man he is. Loves to travel all over the world enjoy good whiskey and enjoy people’s tax money.
-- Biased extremist interview -- He is the only politician in Sri Lanka today who can even face these kinds of international criticism. It is very easy to criticise and question on behalf of ltte extremists and then get mad hearing answers that you're don't like to hear.
Next Mahinda rajapaksa
Hats off to Al Jazeera.  Ranil - Conniving & Deceitful another disgusting FAILED politician of Sri Lanka.  When people of Sri Lanka were struggling to live  Ranil spent Rs. 533 billion for his overseas trips from 2022 - 2024.  He keeps on saying present government is following the plan he has set up.  NO, THEY ARE NOT.  Present government NPP is corrupt free and following their own plans to bring the country back from economic damages done by Ranil & Rajapaksha regimes. The whole country know what happened at Batalanda.  There is a report.  You can download it and read from internet.  I suggest NPP government to table Batalanda Commission Report to the Parliament.  However, report was handed over to then President Chandrika Bandaranayake, they say.
This wasn't an interview—it was more of a platform for the angry Tamil diaspora in the UK, who left Sri Lanka many years ago and still seem to carry that baggage. Meanwhile, Tamils in Sri Lanka have moved forward. Perhaps it's time to do the same.  The interviewer came across as disrespectful and seemed more interested in grandstanding for attention than fostering a meaningful conversation.  Does Sri Lanka have problems? Absolutely. Was the ethnic issue handled fairly? No, it wasn't. But it's essential to remember that there are two sides to every story. We cannot ignore the mass killings carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), one of the most brutal terrorist organizations in the world.  War is never fair—it's ugly and cruel, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. However, there comes a point when we must move forward.  This could have been a valuable opportunity to hear both sides of the story, especially since so few Sri Lankan politicians agree to open interviews like this. It's a pity—that was a missed opportunity.
Thank you very much Al-Jazeera.   Sri Lankan media is not able to ask this question.   He is a fox, Srilankan media cannot catch this fox.
Well asked Mr Mehdi. 👍🏼 plenty of Spicy questions for Mr Ranil. But he smartly refused to answer the truths.
im a Sri lankan..Thank u very much Al jazeera for this ..
Thank you Al Jazeera. ❤❤ Well done reporter . Respect you as Sri Lankan
one more mahinda mama int
Thank you Al - Jazeera !!! ❤
A poorly conducted interview, for many a reason,,,following being a few I  noticed. 1. He (Journalist ), seemed to have not done any research into what actually took place and the geopolitical perceptions in this part of the world. He was just tabling quotes from a few foreign and local bodies and asking Ranil to respond to those.  You don't need a journalist to do that,,,any 15 year old would have  done that.  And , end of each answer he ( journalist), passes a sarcastic remark to please a section of the audience,  from whom he ( journalist ) would get continous business. 2. Seemed that he ( journalist) had come only with one intention that was to grill Ranil and seek glorification for himself. The attendees were denied of the very purpose of the interview.  3. Ranil also got caught in his ( journalist's ) trap of "not allowing adequate time for an answer and at the  end of each answer the journalist made a responsive sarcastic remark for which he never allowed time for Ranil to respond. Instead he moved to the next question without even a blink. But Ranil should have been smarter with this nut. Cheers
An old Ferrari with a Lamborghini Revuelto
A moment of silence for those who thought ranil was only a bad politician when he is speaking in Sinhala 😅
Ranil - like Anura - comment
Thank you Al-Jazeera.  ❤️🇱🇰🇱🇰
Non Violent Nation ???? What a contradiction!!!
This donkey not letting Ranil to speak
This is better to be translated in to sinhala.. all the people should see this
Can you translate or subtitles sinhala for all sri lankans. Thank you ❤
Someone tell Ranil that the audience is laughing at him, not with him
ரணில் அல்ல உண்மையாகவே பெரிய நரி தான் என்பது மீண்டும் நிரூபிக்கப்பட்டது
Reporter is confrontational. Useless.
Can someone do the sinhala subtitle to this otherwise who voted the opposition will think grandpa nailed this interview.
Think....its another USAID funded... Journalism and a journalist....question a person who opposed the well established regime change ...the only person who reversed the well oiled regime changing juggernaut. Salute you Ranil... Citizen of Sri Lanka...
Ranil shouldn't be interviewed, he should be investigated for crime and corruption under his leadership. Anyway, the primary concern should be he is not elected by people just end the story.
Whatever its is Ranil is one and only parliamentarian Who has the brave to face international journalist. None other politician in Sri lanka can do this up-to this level.
I thought Ranil would just collapse right there at the pace of questions thrown at him by Mehdi
When they are unable to face some questions, they easily thrash them by saying I was in politics before you were born or don't lose your temper or similar gimmicks.
Thank you mr presidental for defending our county in front of  so called unbiased journalism
Well done Aljezzera. He was really roasted...... As a srilankan I am glad and proud. We left Srilanka aftr struggling in all aspects. Hat's off to the brave ,frank stright questions. I wish this was translated into Singala and Tamil.
We had too many biased deal making politicians..Not genetically capable leaders.. Leadership is not backdoor deal brockering.
Ranil is the murderer
Chamuditha from Al jazeera
Great Job. Al jaseera❤
Ranil and Rajapakshas ruins our motherland sri lanka
The Main thing no one mentioned that, in the final stages, the LTTE have used its own people as human sheld and blocking them not allowing the to pass. The main reson for the casualties.
He talks of Buddhism!! It’s a joke !! Such a comedian RW !! Maturity ???

Well done Al Jazeera ❤️❤️❤️
Ranil… 🤡
This is not a normal interview. Whenever Ranil starts to articulate a answer this guy disrupt him. He follows a script. Coordinated attack, probably orchestrated by Julie and diaspora combined.
Ranil fox🐕🐕

Really good questions Mehdi. Ranil Wikramasinghe tried to be cocky like he does every time when someone asked him a challenging question.  Thank you for exposing him and his moral corruption more than anything ❤
Even I didn't support for Mr Wickremasinghe in my entire life. But in this interview they just trying to corner him to the war crimes as well as they just pretending like Sinhala people were not affected by this war and army killed innocent Tamil people not the LTTE. No one knows the situation at that time. Human rights were breached mostly by the tigers attacking the innocent people at South. I don't like his politics and also when he is trying to cover Rajapaksha's corruptions. But this interviewer trying to direct the people in Sri Lanka and the world to a bad direction and also making a bad reputation about Sri Lankan forces. 🙁
Mehdi Hasan 🫡
Thanks for al jazerra, you done the great job, every politician from the government side is aragons and devils never treat minority people as a human being, grabbing  tamil people lands, no justice, they tell lying to the world,they are growing   Extremist, did biggest war crimes, they should go to international criminal court, take justice to the innocent people who affected by them.  Lan
He didn’t do anything to country. He used religion, culture , and money to get in to politics. He protected all the corrupted politicians while he was in power. Ask him about 1988-1989 time period. How many young people killed under his leadership. People rejected him many time. But still he is trying to come to power. Look at how he behaves in public media. Do you want someone like him as a leader in your country.
He is the man who killed most young people in late 90' s .Dog of rajapaksha
Weldone aljazeera you did amazing job 😮
Aljazeera ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤OMG !!! Thank you 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
මෙලෝ දෙයක් තේරෙන්නෑ  මට😢😂😂
He is so funny. This was a funny interview
0:59 finally a westerner pronouncing one of our names right lol.
Bro failed the task successfully
Bro tried real hard not to cry. 😂
Thank you al jazeera ❤ you revealed the evilness of this fascist M*F
Mr.Journalist please come to Srilanka to educate our Local journalist
Great interview and good questions too except for the sanctimonious attitude of the well-known journalist. The two female panalists have mastered the art of being experts on 'nothing' which was evident to those who have a balanced perspective of the reality on the ground. Ending a war is not a non-violent process. Many died along the way on both sides. The terrorists and their enablers who brainwashed the generations of Tamils to hate the Sinhalese and the halfwits in the South who never had a vision for a pluralistic nation to live in peace should be held responsible for the human suffering we all endured. The government in the country has the right to decide how to deal with nonstop ethnic violence, bombings and perpetual intimidation from the so called "international community" flogged on by the Tamil Diaspora. The rights of all people to be upheld and equality of rights to all  in Sri Lanka should be the only way forward. Ranil Wickramasinghe showed once again that he is a masterful speaker who can handle pressure and face any journalist in the world including the third-class ones who have no control over their misguided emotions while on the job.
Grandpa looks very uncomfortable, the questions are too real for him.
මෙලෝ දෙයක් තේරෙන්නෑ  මට😢😂😂
This is a bulshit journalism
Guy who ran torture chambers talking about non violence - what a slug!
I have no idea why Ranil can’t explain what LTTE terrorists did to innocent civilians in Sri Lanka such as Train and bus bombs. As well as killing Buddhist child monks in Anuradhapura?
Well-done Mr Mehdi. We Sri lankans don't like this guy. 😢😢😢
A war criminal is going unpunished
This cunning, deceitful, homosexual eunuch got the leadership of the country's most powerful political party because the previous Executive President Ranasinghe Premadasa killed the senior members of his own party who challenged him. He became the leader unopposed when Premadasa died untimely in a bomb attack. He did nothing for the country. He killed the noble youth of the country blatantly using the police and the army. But unfortunately, with the technology available in our country at that time, he was acquitted in court and before the law. But on the day nature hears the case, the tears and blood of all those who died, were subjected to gang rape, and suffered countless tortures will definitely punish him.  Even though he was the president, making political deals for personal gain and gaining power, he could never win the popular vote because his character is known to everyone except the minority who are looking for benefits from him. Nature will surely punish him in due time.
Rani should be charged for war crimes against the JVP and against the tamils. what a thug.
Imagine if Mahinda Rajapaksha were interviewed by Mehdi. 😂
This man was the one who ran the torture chambers of the people during the 1987/88 terror and murdered 60,000 young people in SrI Lanka.
*It's a huge L to Ferrari's brand image and reputation*  *Had Ferrrari known Ranil was implicating himself to the brand, and performing in the manner he did with Al jazeera, they would for sure file a defamation case against this clown 🤡*  *Even a TVS XL100 (a.k.a. the mosquito 🦟 bike) would outperform the Ranil Ferrari for sure.*
Thank you al-jazeera. They miss used the power always. Seach about "බලටන්ද වදකාගාර "
Ranil you are so fu**ed haha. You can't share religious stories and expect to get away with it in the international media the way you might with Sri Lankans. 19:43 is next level haha
Wickramasinghe meet a real journalist 😊
😅😅😅😅👍👍👍 Good idea.. 😅
He is a one of the person who burned the jafna library
Ranil has deffended the country.some how the journalist is disrespectful and move according to the tamil diaspora agenda.
Thank u aljaseera for your reveal about this beast.❤
The Ferrari broke down in the middle of the interview 😂😂IYKYK
මලකඩ කාපු ඇනයක් 😂😂😂😂😂
Ranil Wikramasinghe 🍃💚🍃
Kudos to the journalist!!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
There is a old Sri Lanka saying "You can win thousand debates with wise man, but you can't never will single debate with a fool" Hassan now you know
He always protected Rajapksa
Mehdi retire pls before you become a shame to your family..what a cheap journalist...The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... The comment by Ranil " I would not contest again and i will be watching Al-Jazeera and hope they will be well mannered in the future "was a great embarrassment to Mehdi and jazeera..Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. ..😄😄😄
As a Srilankan I’m satisfied with your interview. This interview brought out of the screen about the real face of Ranil Wickramasinghe. Unfortunately as Srilankans, we don’t have a great journalist to interview him like this.
Ranul  is speechless, he's a  corrupt person
He corruption all money from the foreigne beuro 2023 September 😅
Thanks al jazeera for takeoff  ranil's mask
The interviewee's objective was very clear. The way he conduct the interview is Very unprofessional . Totally against  the media ethics.
This is the real eye opener to the reality of the political establishment in SriLanka - absolute zero accountability, childish, and, corrupt.

Bravo Mehdi, as a Sri Lankan I am ashamed that we had to live with this kind of shameful politicians. Ranil may have born before Mehdi but not matured and gone rotten trash over the years.
Firstly, I think the host didn't give any chance to complete the answer; Ranil was obstructed, diverted, skipped and even stopped. I appreciate Ranil for all his effort to bring stability after we economically collapsed but having said that I as a citizen observed during such economical difficulties we went through, no initiatives were taken to reduce the state expenditures, no initiatives were taken to control prices of essential items instead we were heavily taxed and no comfort  given to the poor and middle class. What dissapoints me is that we were taxed to see our money being used to look after corrupt culprits like the Rajapakses and over capped state establishments. Essentially there were no conclusion bought in why the Rajapakses weren't held responsible or being questioned for their actions importantly on how they orchestrated racist events and bought an economic collapse to the country, just after Ranil took over.

What as arrogant self opinionated fool

Nothing to explain about him Just he is a great dictator
I don't know why Sri Lankan leaders go to such medias who have hidden agendas to support terrorists 😅 Al Jazeera seems more concerned about terrorists than Sri Lankan people
Al jezeera❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ranil Rajapaksha is the Sri Lankan version of Mr.Bean😂😂
He is a serieal killer
Thank you Al Jazeera.🎉 ❤🇱🇰
This man is the one who bankrupted the country by taxing the people. Including Rajapaksa. Now he is acting like a good man. Look at the situation then and the situation today in the country. He allows money to be stolen and now he is acting like he is the best president in the world.
Thank you for asking those questions we always wanted to ask. He is of course part of the problem.
Thay destroyed the evidence
Best interview I have ever seen❤❤
I respectfully request that Mehendi arrange an interview with the newly appointed President of Sri Lanka at the earliest opportunity.
The way Ranil ignored all the important questions proves what an ignorant, cold-hearted politician he is. Moreover, that itself proves how much he covers up for the Rajapaksas, as this is exactly how the Rajapaksas ignored the people of Sri Lanka
Report with the chandrika kumaranathunga
The Rajapaksa regime looted Sri Lanka for years, driving the country into an unprecedented economic collapse while enjoying impunity. The people’s uprising in 2022 was a direct response to their corruption, nepotism, and reckless governance. Any attempt to whitewash their crimes is an insult to the suffering of ordinary Sri Lankans. Justice must prevail, and those responsible for robbing the nation should be held accountable. No politician linked to that corrupt system should be trusted to rebuild what they destroyed.
Bad journalist 😢😢😢😢...
This is simply what happened rajapaksa thieves bankrupted the country and Ranil always protected them because they had undearneath deals for power , poor Sri Lanka 🥲
He killed so many youngsters.he is beyond evil. Well done Al jazeera..❤️❤️
Full video not hear 👎  2houerly records bad media .. wtf
President answered all questions well❤❤❤❤..great leader Ranil ❤

This fellow has taken  our country for a piece of cake and eaten it all and yet deny that he never had a piece.
It is shame to see how they tried to equal Gaza war and Sri Lanka war against brutal terrorist
Puluwan RANIL REDDE REWILA Dan sapada lankawe chanal walata pukadena meadia wageda ahanna thiyena de  ahanna oni it's lies He burn his things by him self
The way Ranil ignored all the important questions proves what an ignorant, cold-hearted politician he is. Moreover, that itself proves how much he covers up for the Rajapaksas, as this is exactly how the Rajapaksas ignored the people of Sri Lanka during their times.
Simply the dirty politicians in sri lanka
Ex president Ranil is a great leader ❤❤❤❤
AL JAZEERA IS A TERRORIST CHANNEL.  QATAR IS A BEGETS HELPERS OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM. AS A SRI LANKAN, I STAND FOR ISRAEL 🇮🇱 IN THIS SITUATION. I SUPPORT MR WIKRAMASINHA🇮🇱❤️🇱🇰
The people of Sri Lanka know about this. This is the man who committed crimes against this country. He has been in parliament for years and has destroyed the country.
Ranil picked the wrong guy to mess with.
Excellent interview 👏.. Ranil is struggling to answer.  In Sri Lanka too we need interviewers like Mehdi Hasan 😍!
duh!!! such an embarrassment 😟
The program was funded and facilitated by the LTTE diaspora. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe proved that even though there were clear allegations against him, he possessed an internationally recognized political scope and broad knowledge.  Hassan quoting Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksha; a war criminal. Even though Mahinda Rajapaksa and his regime have terrible allegations of corruption and undemocratic actions, he has been able to end the civil war. With his leadership, it has ended, and now not only people in the South, but also people from the North (fellow Tamil people) have been benefiting from that freedom.
Thank you Al jaseera journalism ❤️
Former sri lankan president must acknowledge that his country's political arena is as same as indian hindu nationalist politics in which they try to appease the majority through incessant ,relentless hatred towards minority.
Wow.... ❤️

Al Jazeera එකත්  confused වෙන්නේ  අද තමා අපේ උන්ගේ comments  දැකලා 😂😂😂😂
Dan harine puke amaruwa
I don't like Ranil. But Ranil faced the interview very well. Mehdi is just a fluent වාචාලය who tried to dictate the discussion. He just wanted his answers to come out of Ranil's mouth. Sirasa Suranga, chamuditha are the sri lankan versions. If you are really mindful you would see Ranil has spoken to the point.
අනුර ඔහොම ගියානම් 😂 මොනවා කතාකරනද 😂 කට උල් කරලා ජෙබයියො චූන් කරයි... එච්චරයි

This is someone who has done a lot of damage to the country.
Why can’t the Tamils just move to India , find issues there and leave Sri Lanka to the Sinhalese?
No one in Sri Lanka questioned like this before because he did not attend to any real live programs....
Rs 178 Million Spent On Ranil’s Foreign Trips Despite Economic Crisis
RW is a full joke
This man in governance for so many years?shame
A very informative discussion.
Mehdi Hasan, let the interviewee speak for god's sake. All we can hear is just your constant bellowing two seconds soon after the former Prime Minister opens his mouth and starts to respond.   This definitely isn't a great example of good journalism ..  Anybody can invite a person to an interview and keep interrupting and putting words in the respondant's mouth. This is  just one of the cheap ,low class so called reputed television session I have ever seen as an unbiased spectator looking for facts and actual incidents.   At least do your homework right before questioning a prime minister of a country. He may not be a saint , news flash, i dont think any of us are , in this world. At least do your job right, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Ranil got his behind handed to him. Thank you Al-Jazeera. Great Interview as always mehdi.
Guy who ran torture chambers is trying to hide behind Buddha🤣🤣🤣
jolly seyya ranil rajapakshe shouldn't have expected this roast from mehdi hassan. This is one the best of all time for sri lankans.
Thank you AL Jazeera; this man Ranil Wickremesinghe is a Rajapaksa's servant & a Rajapaksa's dog, Ranil Wickremesinghe is a killer, We really respect & appreciate your contribution to the showing his nudity political schedule to the world, any day majority Sri Lankan people didn't welcome as a leader of our country, he is only a political begger , he is the opener of Batalanda, he is the main character of bank robber, thank you AL JAZEERA again & again ❤
what a cheap journalist...The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. 😄😄😄
සීයට වෙච්චි දෙයක් 😂
Bro thought it was “TNL” (His brother’s channel) and he forgot the name was “Al-Jazeera” 🔥🔥🔥
Mr Mehdi 🫡 Mr Ranil You are what you are born to kill people and do gay parties in Bentotage Beach hotel with Rugby boys 😂
RW: "I have been in politics before you were born" REPORTER:"Some might say that's the part of the problem" 😂😂😂
@ Mehdi ...Time to retire ..You were not even born bro ..
When you see a real journalist this is what happens 😂 seeya whent to Al Jazeera like going to hiru and nai dherana
The first time he had met a real journalist, it was not chamuditha or the other jokers.
AG in SL is a puppet working for the government. "Clean" initiative must be started with Police and Judiciary. Both institutions are infested with MR/RW/SP cabal loving lowlifes. I remember Australian government hiring retired London Police Commissioner to "clean" Victoria police department which was corrupt to the core in 1990's.
Thank you, Mr. Ranil Wickramasingha, for your leadership and dedication to Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Army has played a crucial role in maintaining stability, and their sacrifices deserve the utmost respect. A special appreciation to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his decisive leadership in bringing an end to terrorism and restoring peace to the nation. His efforts in safeguarding the country’s future will always be remembered
Al Jalzeera questioning about human rights abuse is really so touching. Please do the next interview with Qatari Royal families with the same resolve.
Wow, Mehdi! I’ve always had so much respect for you, and that respect has doubled after watching this. I lived in Sri Lanka as a child, and Ranil was the prime minister at that time too. All politicians in Sri Lanka are liars, and they are all corrupt. Hopefully, things will change in the future now that Sri Lankans have realised this. By not answering your questions and avoiding accountability during his time as leader, that’s how he has managed to stay in power all his life!
Finally, Ranil met a real journalist
I wonder how these politicians can sleep peacefully after doing all these atrocities and killings to their own country.
Massive respect for the journalist🎉
I salute Mr. Rw for bashing those ill  attitudes of western supremacy and the authoritarian Catholic church ! Well done !
The host is not listening to mr ranil Wickramasinghe properly and kind of giving his opinions rather than actually listening to him. When mr Wickramasinghe tries to explain, arrogantly interrupts and go on accusing. What you have to keep in mind is that it was Ranil who saved the country from bankruptcy. He did not help rajapakses in anyway, if he did, then Rajapakses would have supported him. In this case which had not. So you are painting a total opposite picture to what really happened.  People who were in the aragalaya were the ones who voted for rajapakses all their lives. Ranil Wickramasinghe is not responsible for anything that happened to the country since it is chandrika, mahinda , maithreepala and gotabaya who robbed and ruined the country.
For the first time සීයා was ambushed in style, සීයා full චාටර් වෙලා පීචං උනා.
Ranil the white colar rogue and the protector of Rajapaksas, guardian of Easter Bombing and Central Bank Robbers. Ranil can never be trusted. Even after voters kicking him out several times he still wants to creep into the Parliament through the back door. He is SHAMELESS.
👏👏👏
This swiveling slug is the guardian of Rajapukse cabal.  He is a master of hiding his dark soul.

He doesn’t know how to act like a journalist
This journalist is a very biased man. Asks questions that go along with LTTE/separatist talk points. It's clear that his agenda is to frame those who ended Sri Lanka's separatist war as 'human rights violators/criminals'.  Sri Lankans who admire Mehdi Hassan here are the same naive bunch that cheered the USAID-sponsored color revolution aka 'aragalaya' in Sri Lanka.   Not a surprise that Sri Lanka can't move forward with such a population that suffers from a massive inferiority complex.
👍👍👍
Ranil thinks that he was a world-puzzard leader, he was not because he had not accepted the country because he was the person who wanted to do only Ranil only protects Ranil
Shame on you Ranil Wickramasinghe! Disgusting person.  Him and his political party destroyed the whole nation. We are waiting for the justice.  Hats off to the Journalist Mr. Mehdi & Al-Jazeera❤️🫡
What a Interview! Well done for the journalist.
රනිල් හිතන්නේ එයා ලෝක පුජිත නායකයෙක් කියලා එයා වටේ ඉන්න අය තමයි ඒක හදලා තියෙන්නේ එයා රට බාර ගත්තේ කවුරුවත් නැති නිසා නොවේ මහින්ද ට අවශ්‍ය පුද්ගලයා රනිල් මොකද එයාට ආරක්ෂාව තියෙන්නේ රනිල් ලග විතරයි
Regardless of the allegations what were discussed in this media meeting, there is a lesson to learn for current president, Anura Kumara. He Is liable to be questioned in same manner in an international forum in the future if he failed to  meet his promises being a president who  had full powers and majority in the parliament today. We wish Anura will do his best to meet with his promises.
Joker more than Mr Bean..
There’s collateral damage in war due to mistakes etc. There’s no evidence to suggest that Sri Lankan forces deliberately targeted civilians during the civil war. The LTTE supporting diaspora made false claims to avenge the destruction of LTTE terrorists as well as the fantasy dream of the so called Tamil state. The war is over the diaspora LTTE supporters need to move on.
Well done,  you're 💯 correct.  Asoka Jay, from Sri Lanka. ❤
Finally I see the faces of the people in the audience reflecting the same disgust we feel everyday. We Srilankans as a nation have been tortured by these people for decades.
Appalling interview. It's a disgrace to even to listen to this man. Whi can even answer a question like a leader. No empathy no remose no accountability no liability. He has after all done nothing wrong!!! What a joke.
First of honorable ranil wickremesinghe sir appointed as President in sri Lanka within Parliament.. That majority of parliamentarians are elected by majority of our sri lankan people's thos who don't have any political literacy as current government elected..and new government came into power by promising to arrest Rajapaksha former our President who deafened most ruthless terrorists group in history 🙏( 😁 but still not arrested ) . most importantly it was very difficult time for disgraceful nation when Ranil wickremesinghe sir comes into power. It was not his political campaign arrest Rajapaksha   he was appointed by Parliament as President and  he did great job for country 🙏.. And second Easter attack another one of political topics in Sri Lanka. so far current government wasn't able to  arreste or  reveal any information to country. It was their political promised.. You just try without any evidence make falls allegation against mr wickremesinghe with Tami lady.... We don't forget what Tamil terrorist did to us
😂😂😂😂😂
This guy Ranil never accepts or apologizes for any of his wrongdoing. He just tries to get away with his words or loopholes in the corrupt systems they created. Ukrain president Zelenski has become a politician. This guy has become a real Joker. 😳
Seeya Met a Real journalist for the first time in his life
what a cheap journalist...The "NO CONTEST" answer from ranil  will survive "RENT FREE" in This joker of a journalists mind until his death ..serves him right .. he finally met someone he cannot bully with his "question and question " sessions ( rather than a civilized Question and answer " session... Al-Jazeeera should fire this guy and STOP this nonsense journalism ruin their reputation further. 😄😄😄
Why is there no Sinhalese representation on the board? They have a story too. I think more than 100 million Tamils live in India and around the globe. If they really want a territory, they can establish it in Tamil Nadu.
Hon. Ranil wikramasinghe❤❤❤great leader❤❤
. Thank you Al-Jazeera!❤
රනිල් : I have been in politics before you were born.  මාද්‍යවේදිය : some might say that's Part of the problem  ❤ Run 😅
Pro in appointing committees for anything and everything, but nothing constructive comes out from these committees 😂
Does the present President Hon Anura Dissanayake aware of this interview. Please ensure that this is aired on Sri Lsnka National TV
He thinks this interview also like palki sharma interview 😂poor Ranil Rajapaksha😂 good job Mehedi you undressed corrupt elite political cockroach in Sri Lanka
We was in srilanka 😂
Awaiting to see interviews of GR, MR, and NR
Realy very bad man muredrous ranil
It is such a shame on us Sri Lankans  having a President like Ranil for 2 years in Sri Lanka
Ranil Wickremesinghe is one of the most corrupt politicians in Sri Lanka and a key reason behind the economic crisis we face today. As he himself admitted, he is ‘Ranil Rajapaksa’ because he always protected and supported the Rajapaksa family. During his time in power, he made no real decisions, allowing them to manipulate and use him as their puppet.  Even during the Easter Sunday attacks, when he was the Prime Minister, he did absolutely nothing. To this day, there has been no real justice for the victims, no proper accountability for those behind it. This man is a criminal, just like the Rajapaksas. One day, he too should be behind bars along with them. I don’t even want to see this man’s face!
බයි pnnynt තේරෙන්නැති නිසා පෞ උන්😪
Politicians trying dividing a country- prime example. Conflicts in SL history killed many, good smart young people. Not the correct ones. This one is haunting us big time
He is one of a main culprit who has destroyed our motherland. Thanks Aljazeera for the removal of his mask💪
This thief has spent 1,804,959.44 US Dollars for going on foreign trips with his whole clan during 2023-2024 while my mother country going through a financial crisis.  This person is a disgrace to Sri Lanka 😥😥
This is gold Al Jazeera. I wanted to see him  question like this for years.
Well, the protests that took place in Sri Lanka in 2022 was similar to the one in Pakistan to remove Imran Khan because he was going close to Russia, the one in Bangaladesh in 2023 to remove Shiek Hasina because she was favoured in India,  funded and staged by foreign elements with the locals who were opposed to the leaders in order to remove the Rajapaksas because they were assumed to be close to China, who otherwiswe couldn't have been removed from power through elections in the near future as otherwise they would have strengthened their position even further.  the so-called color revelutions around the world for the interests of foreign powers, especially the West.  e.g. Ukraine in 2014.
I have a huge respect for Al Jaseera!
Well done Mr Wickramasinghe…👏👏👏
All the best Al Jazeera
Only RW can 👑
This man is a shame to the country
This is sad to see that most of the participants try to compare the Civil War in SL to Gazza and Israeli war crimes. This is interesting that some speakers are not even lived in SL and they have no idea about how Tamils and Sinhalese have been living in SL before the Civil War began which was mostly a political movement more than was came from general public.  Nehdi, what Ranil should have said that India and America were behind tgos whole process and Ranil and Gotabaya are just acting on behalf of the international interest. In General Shavendra  Silva, First America black list them then America blackmail them so that America can get them to do all the conspiracies against SL democracy for the benifit of western propaganda.  Shavendra Silva is one of the key figures who was behind the uprising in 2022.  Amerca and UN  they all first blaxklist as war criminals then they use the same accused personals to get the dirty work done against the interst of the sovereignty of the countries like the most recent example in Siriya. We can clearly see the audience also majority are SL Tamil and only they are given a voice. It is sad that some of the comments on Civil War were not true but Diaspora money talking 😂😂😂 The lady who was talking about war crimes are definitely lying about the severity of the war comes during the Civil War  by cpmaeing with GAZA. The lady is taking this opportunity to manipulate fir the benifit of the Tamil Diaspora propaganda against SL. No one talks the inhumane killing carried out by Tamils both against their own communities in Jaffna and Sinhalese living in North  This lady is lashing out completely lies in the interst of propaganda.  She talks with angry and manipulation in the name of hatred towards SL
This man is not a elected president of Sri Lanka . Just a opportunist .
Ranil is a laughing and murderous Peoples. He knows no democracy, he is a thief and a Chester.
That's why many people voted for Anura Kumara and the NPP. All the other politicians are very corrupt. They don't care about our people. They want money and political power
6:38 Uncle poked bro's ego, and next thing you know, bro turned uncle into dinner 🫠
this is not full video, only half edited.
Simply kuptu vetchi senjitanuga😂😅😂
Even he dont know about how to behave with audiance, he think he can control everything everyone , things are not friendly on him he behave like this, 😂
Thank you for putting this treator on to the hot seat. He is a liar, treator, and a bastud and a joker. He  wasted tax payers' money and enjoy his own life.. This idiot should be punished and put him into jail
Who else but Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Batalanda torturer? We appreciate your Al Jazeera channel for informing the international community about this.
Bro wasnt expecting this he though it would be easier like back in srilanka 😂😂
Al jazeera thanks for this interview. As a Sri Lankan something we long awaited interview.
Iam wndering why this guy not behind the bars.shame on him,,,,😢
Rajapakses may Criminals in common sense . However not WAR criminals . They and armed forces did the best for best for the country to kick the daylight out of a brutal terrorist group . There policy was Zero casualties. In terrorist was it was not possible. No hospital were targeted. Could have been collateral damage . It was one sided  to be fair .
you lose becouse friend of rajapasha and corruption
Netflix man 😂
Typical revenge attitude of 3rd class media ethics.... sooo arrogance . Hate
thats wrong when bombing he was with his lover in hotel and watching Netflix 😂
Al Jazeera Throw up as usual. Nothing more than propaganda.
I said no contest 😂
As a Sri lanka all nation living  very peacefully,  I dont Understand why Aljazera want to break it
Ranil is a lier ... rouge, and I am from Colombo and once i was supporting his vision and later relaized that he was scamming us with his family high class name.
Whole world know about this lier except ranil 😂
Dear Hiru and Derana Tv, (srilankan unuseful medias)  learn from aljazeera, how to take interviews from corrupt politicians?  Respect Mehdi🫡 and Aljazeera🤝
His facial expressions tells everything!!  This is good example of how true and well prepared journalist can destroy the fake politician's image.   Thanks Al Jazeera ❤ Thanks Mehdi Hasan ❤ for exposing this white-collar thief who has several allegations throughout his political carrier - Ranil Wickremesinghe's true face to entire world.  Shame for politically blind people who still think he has done something to Sri lanka.   රනිල්ට වැල් පාලමේදිම බඩයනවා දුටිමි 🤮
This is one of disgusting person who ruled our mother land!
He said he is buddhist, he is joking about it ester sunday attack , brutal man 😡
Someone please do sinhala subtitles 😂
This guy is still lying, he destroyed our country and look how he behave like nothing happend....
al jazeera😂😂 hasan ltte propagandist ranil wqs surrounded by him hasan didnt even respect him and only 1h out of the 2 hour interview 😂😂😂
This guy is full of corrupted in his whole life and don't worry  cardinal will address for this bullshit.
⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚓⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖⚖
Also Mr Wickramasingha you better be happy that Mehdi went mild on you usually he is more aggressive as he should be... but maybe feeling sorry for you or afraid that you might pass out unable to answer the questions he toned it down 😂.  so embarrassing the X president behaving like such a brat 😂
Mehdi please invite Namal Rajapakshe for an interview
Yes, true rajapakshas apointed him. 😂
No one is like to them, because of that he came here again 😂.
Hand-off Al Jazeera ❤🫡
This idiot learnt to appoint commissions at the expense of the public money and discarded the reports of those commissions only to silence the public outcries for the time.
This guy is good at pulling religion when he is loosing the argument..,..
You interview was not fair one sided .You tried to humiliate Ranil by showing the audience often laughing.. Further Ranil says you pro LTTE women was brought in to panel with out informing him. . Also say some of his answers were omitted .  Eg. about 40000 casualties . A British MP exposed secret documents of casualties as 7000 odd . I am definitely losing confidence in Aljazre as balanced TV station . Shame !
Mehdi nailed it 😂
The Butcher of Batalanda 1988/1989 - Ranil Wickremesinghe conducted the Genocide of 66000 youth Sri Lankans.
Mehdhi ,  With all due respect.  U interviewed the wrong person. He is the problem. So what is the point.
What a garbage bin .... I'm even shame to say that I'm from Sri Lanka 🤢
Chamuditha wagee😂😂😂
ටොයියෝ නැද්ද මේ ලස්සන දර්ශනය බලන්න
They controlled the court too. 😡
This shows how immature  Ranil is. He cannot answer a simple question and take no responsibility. Shame on you Ranil. You no longer represents any value of  Sri Lankan people. Ranil is an arrogant  politician who lead Sri Lanka to 30 year civil war.
Ranil is a biggest reason for sri lankan failure.
I saw this guy face to DW journalist and behaviour was so childish. But some poor SL people think he is real scholar 😂😂😂
Rajapakshas and this man very good friends, 😂
රනිලා චොර වුනා... බොරු කිය කිය තමයි ජිවත් වුනේ. ලංකාවේ මාධ්‍යයෙන් බේරුණාට ව්දේශ මාධ්‍යයෙන් බේරෙන්ඩ බෑ. රනිලා දැන්වත් උදච්චකම අත ඇරපන්. 0:48
Ranil jokes about church bombing, genocide and missing persons. Sivaranjan cries that he is not the President. 😌
Church bombing, இனப்படுகொலை காணாமல்ப்போன சனத்தைப் பற்றி ஜோக் அடிக்கிறான் ரணில். அவன் ஜனாதிபதி ஆகேல்ல எண்டு அழுகிறான் சிவரஞ்சன். 😌
Looks like tamil diaspora or JVP written the script

Queen and king first, innocent people second 😂
The journalist interviewed Ranil with Arrogance , harsh, disturbing manner.. not good media ethics....
Textbook journalism meeting textbook politics 😂 Ends up everyone shouting at each other and no point of watching
Ranil defends the country. Third-class idiots think foreign journalists are heroes.
Can you please post the entire interview without cutting and editing ?
Yes, they hold election 1000%  agree 😡😡😡
why is there a LTTE panel? they are biased
Poor journalist who does not know ethics.
Ranil and Rajapaksha family are friends...They protect each other....Ranil is a corrupted politician...🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
A Premeditated Attack Disguised as Journalism  I’ve watched Mehdi Hasan before, he’s always aggressive and combative. But even by his usual standards, his interview with Ranil Wickremesinghe was deeply premeditated. This wasn’t about getting answers. It wasn’t about journalism. It was about pushing an agenda, an outright interrogation where the objective was to attack, not engage.  There’s a way to ask tough questions while still being fair. Instead, Mehdi shouted over responses, cut off explanations, and twisted words to fit his own narrative. If the answer didn’t suit him, he simply refused to listen.  I’ve seen how he operates, but I wonder does he apply the same treatment to leaders from powerful nations? Does he aggressively grill them on their failures, their war crimes, their human rights abuses with this same level of hostility? Or is this reserved for leaders from smaller nations like ours?  No one is saying Sri Lanka is without flaws. We have work to do. We need reforms. We need accountability. But that’s our fight. Sri Lankans will decide the future of Sri Lanka, not a journalist with an agenda, not an international media outlet with selective scrutiny.  Public service is often a thankless job. But distorting facts, rewriting history, and weaponizing interviews to undermine a country’s progress is shameful.  You may love him or hate him, but you can’t deny the facts, when Sri Lanka hit rock bottom, RW stepped in and pulled the country out of an economic recession and quagmire. Not once, but twice, first in 2001 and again in 2022. No one else had the courage to take responsibility when it mattered most. At the very least, we must show some gratitude.  And let’s not get carried away celebrating this so-called “takedown.” No contemporary politician in Sri Lanka could have stood up to that level of bullying and hostility. RW, once again, proved why he stands apart.  Sri Lanka will move forward, not on the terms of an international journalist with an agenda, but on our own.
Joke of a journalist. Also the first audience speaker is the biggest LTTE terrorist sympathizer in the UK
Watching this cured my two hernias
He is a weird ruthless murderer who learnt to confront the public as if nothing wrong has happened on his part. Some people still believe him.
Journalist is arrogant. Not allowed Mr.Wickramasinhe to express his point of view clearly, disturbed constantly. First of all the journalist should learn how to conduct an interview. His behaviour is disgusting. You ask a question and allow the other party to answer completely, not the other way around. Shame on you. learn your manners first.
If a guy can send his own lime light down the hill within the first five minutes it's none other than grampa Ranil 😂😂😂 04:43
කජු සියා.. Left
The interview was on point, Except Al-Jazeera's LTTE propaganda
If Satisfaction needs an elaboration. This interview gives it.
This only shows a single side of the story, why wasn’t a member invited to represent the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka? Do you consider the atrocities and innocent murders that were inflicted on them while Indian Tamil terrorists themselves inciting violence, including death on Sri Lankan Tamils? Why don’t we talk about child soldiers of the north, where’s the human rights on them? No justice was served for the true victims of this, but the war was ended which was the collective hope of the true citizens of Sri Lanka
Mr MH needs to learn how to conduct an interview and allow time to answer.
Question is in the Title  & the Answer is on the Thumbnail 😒
Of course no one will admit that he is wrong   Anyway thanks for all the quality questions but no answers. Only lame excuses. This our political life. Keep up your good work god bless
Hats off. This is what we wanted. The true face of this so called Ranil Rajapaksha,   the smartest some slaves say, has being exposed. The evilness to his own nation, no matter what religion he didn’t play fair. End of his journey. Once again thanks to you.
Thank you interviewer ❤❤❤, he is brutal murder. Now he had interview on here after this interview. 😂. He said that you guys edit the good parts and add negative parts 😂, but here is the full one , $%& ranil 😡
He is a Fox!
What wonderful timing. Ranil was exposed like never before. Well done Al Jazeera.
I'm a Sri Lankan and this interview just healed me.  For the first time, Ranil had the opportunity to engage in a conversation with a seasoned and professional journalist.  Thank you, Al Jazeera.👏❤
Asking the Fox about who ate the Hens
He was elected by a parliament of self entitled MPs. See his defense of demolition of the protest
RW continued with the Rajapaksha policies further destroying our motherland
Human rights paid USAID….
Fantastic job aljazeera! Brilliant questions you nailed it oh poor Ranil 😭 First time in his life he met a real journalist!
Cancelled Friday movie night, watching this instead
He is a real journalist.
Paw bang apey seeya 😅
Thank you Al - Jazeera and the journalist! ❤️
If his answer is the report isn't housed so it isn't make him innocent about JVP attacks in 87/88
And to think 23% voted for him in the 2024 Presidential Elections tells you about the political literacy of our people...  What an absolute disgrace of a politician. This is whom you refer to as "scum of the earth"
I am sri lankan. This is the most ugliest politician. Thanks Al-jaseera.
Hats off Frances Harrison. She explained very nicely how this man was ruled Sri Lanka like no other. He is a political geedier never think to retire from politics. He has a severe ego and anybody can notice it the way he answer the questions. He cannot ignore the truth.That's  why he stucked with questions.That's why he try to fight with ' Buddhist' sheild. He thinks bringing his faith or what ever to Buddhism can divert the whole discussion.Thank you AlJazeera and Medhi striped off this man. Though AG meant to be independent it wasn't. So far that position was clear reflection of a prevailing government. He is lying in front of this audience. Currently AG position hold by a person who is appointed by this man. It was totally political appointment as   this man was totally ignored the the next person, a Lady was in hierarchy and made that appointment as his henchman. Even with a new government AG still doesn't  have an idea how to behave independently and for the betterment of the country.
Rani is cunning fox. Thanks Aljazeera ❤️
I am ashamed such a meniac is called as Sri Lankan😢
Missing one more point about what ranil has done to central bank of sri lanka
When Sri Lankan are doing well now, why these aliens want to talk about this poor country when the countries they live in do more atrocities world wide behind closed doors
Well done ranil . Excellent answers.  Mehdi the pandithaya met more than his match . Jayawewa !  Thank you for taking srilanka out of the mess it was in 2022 . Appreciations .
Ranil without his trouser. Ranil met his waterloo.
BIG  FOX  DOESNT  SPEAK .O4   TIMES  AGAMATHI    OI PRESIDENT  IN SRI  LANKA. NOW  SRI  LANKA  LOST .
Journalism at its peak
The Rajapakse, Wickramasinghe plunderers and rouges
He is a demon. He should be in prison. Ranil wickremesinghe devil
Great journalism👏
why  dont you question Keir Starmer like this?
Ranil Rajapaksa talking about democracy😢😢😢😢
வாழ்த்துக்கள் ஆல் யெசிறா
Legend 😂👑🦁
Mr. Ranil clearly didnt get enough time to answer questions, the interviewer is just dumb comment and jump in the middle of every answer which is very unfair. Clearly diaspora is funding them and all the SriLankans should stand up against this media behavior of this interviewer.
The interviewer has to have some kind of patience until the answer  being completed, I am not happy about the program being conducted
Y Jazeera cant talk like these on Ukraine and Palestie war  ??
The journalist must allow the president to answer the question, instead of interrupting.
Ranil promted violence and was responsible for the lossess of many lives during the darkest era of Sri Lanka. He promoted financial corruptions to favor a few businessmen and protected Rajapakshas amidst their enormous corruptions. He is responsible for the burning down of South Asia's largest library at that time to create a racist issue. He is virtually not human.
Sri Lankan media have consistently avoided asking critical questions, often prioritizing political allegiances over journalistic integrity. In contrast, Al Jazeera has demonstrated true journalistic professionalism by addressing the pressing issues that many local media outlets choose to ignore. Thank you Mehdi
I believe Al Jazeera is a biased and corrupted media outlet, with a left-leaning perspective. The journalist in the video appeared biased and unprofessional.
It is so obvious that Ranil Wickramasingha is not used to thiis type of questioning.(such a shame).. The journalist in Sri Lanka unfortunately don't have the courage to question our politicians to their faces and push for answers like the way Mehdi does ... Which is one of the reasons why Sri Lanka ended up becoming a bankrupt country.😂
Bye bye වික්‍රමසිංහ,  C U ↗️ jail.
Real journalist Mr. Mehdi ❤️ love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
Rajapaksa family broke the country and Ranil got their support to stay in power after Gotabaya was kicked out.  they are theifs and stolled all the money from the  treasury to fill yheir pockets. Still working as a team to get power.
What I mainly saw in this was an attempt to get him to certify that the human rights violations that occurred during the civil war were not the main party responsible for them.
There are 36 cases against Gotabe
How are you people to take about sri lanka. Did you really lived in sri lanka while the war was there? Please don't take what you don't know.
Interview Style Comparison Al Jazeera Direct and Confrontational: Al Jazeera often adopts a direct approach with rapid-fire questioning. This style is designed to expose inconsistencies and hold public figures accountable. The questions are usually backed by thorough research and legal or factual evidence.  Intense Pressure: The format pushes interviewees into a high-pressure situation where evasion is difficult. This can lead to visible emotional responses if the interviewee feels cornered or unfairly targeted.  BBC Hard Talk Rigorous and Inquisitive: BBC Hard Talk similarly employs a methodical approach, emphasizing well-prepared questions that are often rooted in detailed evidence and historical context. The aim is to extract clear, accountable answers on complex issues.  Balanced Yet Persistent: While also direct, Hard Talk tends to maintain a balanced tone, combining firmness with a degree of respect. The interviewer usually allows space for detailed responses but remains persistent in seeking clarity on controversial points.  Comparative Impact: Both platforms use rigorous questioning techniques. However, BBC Hard Talk often strikes a slightly more measured tone, balancing confrontation with an effort to maintain a constructive dialogue, whereas Al Jazeera's approach can be more overtly aggressive, potentially leading to more immediate emotional reactions.  Behavior of the Former President Emotional Response and Public Perception: When a former president responds to challenging questions with anger and insults, it signals discomfort and defensiveness. This reaction may suggest that the individual is either unprepared to address the rigorous evidence presented or feels personally attacked by the questioning style.  Professionalism Under Scrutiny: Both interview styles are designed to test a leader’s accountability. An inability to respond calmly under such scrutiny can harm the leader's credibility. The reaction—whether in the form of emotional outbursts or verbal insults—might be interpreted as a sign of underlying issues, such as unresolved controversies or a gap between past actions and current responsibilities.  Contextual Considerations: The broader political and historical context, such as contentious events from a leader’s past, can further fuel such intense responses. The behavior observed in interviews may reflect deeper internal conflicts or pressures that extend beyond the immediate conversation.  Conclusion Both Al Jazeera and BBC Hard Talk are known for their rigorous, evidence-based interviewing techniques, though their approaches differ slightly. Al Jazeera's method is often more confrontational, potentially provoking stronger emotional reactions, while BBC Hard Talk tends to balance firmness with a respectful tone, aiming for detailed accountability without escalating tension excessively. In cases where a former president becomes visibly upset and resorts to insults, it raises questions about their readiness to confront challenging issues and maintain professionalism in the face of intense scrutiny.
A big hero at home tried to perform his "heroics" outside his home and proved who he really is- An absolute joker! Thank you, Al Jazeera.
Al Jazeera,you missed one major question to ask him.why did he appoint the most corrupted person who is in the wanted list now as the Head of the police Department?Deshabandu Thennakoon.
Mehdi equating the action taken against mobs planning to attack Parliament—an act influenced by current government members, as openly acknowledged by Mr. Lal Kantha—to the arrest of Gotabaya over his allegations is misleading. These are two entirely different matters. The former falls under emergency powers exercised by the President in response to immediate threats to national security, whereas the arrest of Gotabaya would require a civil legal process through the judiciary, not a direct action by the President. There is no evidence that Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe interfered with the judiciary to shield Gotabaya; instead, he upheld judicial independence, which is fundamental in a democracy. A President does not have the authority to arrest individuals directly. What Mr. Ranil said here is correct.
These UK, France gov not clean either 😢 Talk big when come to advise the rest. 😮
THIS  IS  A  VERY  BEST  INTERVIEW  TO  SRI  LANKEN  PEOPLE  AND  OTHER  PEOPLE.  FOX MAN  DOESN T TELL  ANYTHIG   HE  IS VERY  CHEAT.
This political phox beautifully cornered. When the country was on fire for forty years and this man watched and watched without any meaningful help. Worst politician in srilankan political history.
*This clown 🤡 played his usual tired routine during the interview, pulling every card from his playbook:*  *1. Threatening to walk out like he always does when faced with tough questions.*  *2. Shouting over the host in a desperate attempt to drown out the truth.*  *3. Mentioning ‘I’m Buddhist’ or invoking Buddha every time he needs to play the sympathy card, classic deflection.*  *4. Dodging questions with irrelevant answers, a move he’s perfected over the years to avoid accountability.*  *5. Cracking childish jokes and laughing like it's some comedy show, all to distract from the mess he’s created.*  *It’s the same script he’s been running in Sri Lanka, but Mehdi wasn’t having any of it. So, this time, there was no slithering his way out.*
I'm from the States so my familiarity with Sir Lanka is limited.... But it's had major issues since I was a kid... I hope it can get better...
This is the level of journalism we need in Sri Lanka! 🙌
Ranil Wickramadinghe is like cancer cell in politics and I would never vote for him.  But at the same time he doesn't deserve this hatred because he actually did a difficult task of stabilising the country.  What this journalist is questioning is our sovergnitiy as Sri Lankan.
Normally in sri lanka  people call him as a political FOX .
Ranil said in Parliment quote I have no money even if I had money there is no election unquote rejecting the court judgement

Mr Ranil rajapakse …. a freak should be jail for lifetime. For the amount of people he killed from 1980’s till now.
The first time he is facing a this kind journalist in his whole  political journey 😂
தாத்தாவ கதர உட்டானுங்க
Does anyone know the root cause of this conflict?
Great work aljazeera
Thanks Al Jazeera and Mehdi , next have to expose the Rajapaksa cowards
Great one, Ranil is playing smart while answering the questions! But he Failed.
We are happy as Srilankans that there are people in the world to question these people who destroyed this nation.!
He was a dictator.why not.
Rest of the interview aside.. he is the only one who had the balls call out this guys unprofessional practice and avoid and evade tactics
Even the whole world against these corrupted politicians, A half of people in Sri lanka, who are benefiting from these politicians and parties still supporting them, and keeping silence 😢. Thats bitter and the truth.
Sadly no Lankan journalist has the guts to ask these questions. and Mehdi is well researched on the subject matter
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a low quality human being.  Low quality not just in terms of his principles (or lack there of) but also in terms of his capabilities. He is not particularly bright. He is a largely incompetent lacky of British Imperialism. You see the deference with which he spoke about Elizabeth II.  RW is JR Jayawardena's nephew. He comes from a political family connected to the plantation sector in SL and that SL was entrusted to by our British overlords so that SL may remain subordinate to Britain in line with her maritime interests.  These people should rot in a cell somewhere. But they won't. Because they are the champions of the so-called rules based order. Their rules. Their orders.   If you want to know more, please watch the doco KEENIE MEENIE. Free on Vimeo.
He said he had been opposition leader for ten years but no eveidence come against him I dont know  who is talking the truth.
I saw the very first time Ranil failed in front of a journalist.
For decades, we watched as Sri Lanka suffered under corrupt leadership, with no accountability for the countless wrongs done to our people. So many of us had burning questions. Watching this interview felt like a long-awaited moment of truth. Seeing him struggle to respond, caught off guard by direct and fearless questioning, was a form of healing.  Salute to the journalists who didn’t hold back. Justice may take time, but this moment proves that history won’t forget.
Well done Mehdi. You had studied his past interviews well. You knew he can intemidate interviwers with his stupid jokes or knowlwdge about history and buddhism. Again, well done! We are thankful as a nation for exposing this crook.
The grey haired gentleman among those two ladies in the audience is biased to ranil
This interview seems entirely designed to justify the LTTE terrorist organization as a pure and innocent community. It’s disappointing to see some Sri Lankans supporting Al Jazeera’s biased narrative. It’s even more disheartening to see Sri Lankans standing with this aggressive journalist, who was invited for an interview but refused to give others a fair chance to speak.  Moreover, why is there no Sinhalese representation in their panel of experts? Why? Does Al Jazeera believe they haven’t caused any damage to us (the Sinhalese)? Even from this so-called panel of experts, our people can clearly see how Al Jazeera treats the Sinhalese community.  The three main topics discussed in this interview were:  The Sri Lankan civil war, which lasted nearly 30 years and was initiated by the LTTE terrorist group. The Easter Sunday attack. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka, including inflation and economic collapse. Has this journalist even asked what the LTTE did to Sri Lankans? How did the conflict begin? Why did they want a separate nation? How did the majority of Sri Lankans feel about the attempt to divide the country? If the same situation happened in the UK or the USA, what actions would those countries take?  The second topic was the Easter Sunday attack. This is a matter for Sri Lanka’s intelligence services. The attack happened due to the inefficiency of the Sri Lankan intelligence system. However, Sri Lanka’s Catholic Church, particularly Malcolm Ranjith, claims that it happened because of the Rajapaksas. Let’s assume for a moment that this attack was orchestrated by the Rajapaksas—where is the evidence? Has it been proven in the Supreme Court? Is there an ongoing Supreme Court case? No. Yet, Malcolm Ranjith continues to insist that everything happened because of the Rajapaksas. How ridiculous!  The third topic was the economic crisis. Has anyone discussed how the 30-year civil war impacted Sri Lanka’s economy? How many billions of dollars were spent on that war? Has anyone mentioned how Gotabaya Rajapaksa saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic? How billions were spent on healthcare during that time? Even financial aid of Rs. 5,000 was distributed three times.  Tourism is one of Sri Lanka’s main sources of revenue, but not a single tourist visited during the pandemic. All export activities were blocked. Yet, Sri Lankans blame Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the economic collapse, despite his best efforts to save lives and manage the crisis.  Did this journalist discuss any of these points? It’s truly disappointing to see such a biased and unprofessional journalist from a fake news agency. I respect Ranil for handling the situation calmly and providing genuine answers, even while the journalist continuously interrupted and refused to allow a proper discussion.
Ranil Wickremesinghe was the worst politician after Rajapaksha’s family. Disgusting this guy 🤮
“Kudos to the journalists for exposing Ranil’s actions and holding him responsible.” 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  Mehdi Hasan
THIS  IS  A   VERY  BEST  ENTIVE . RANIL WIKKRAMASINHA  IS  A  BIG  FOX  IN  SRI  LANKA  HE  SOLD  OUR  COUNTRY TO  UROP. NOW  SRI  LANKA  VERY  POOR  COUNTRY.❤❤ THA NKS.😮
enothing was tabled in the parliament against Ranil regarding Batalanda case bcs all were in the parliament for the last 76 years were friends. 😂😂😂😂
Srilankan military and the government support to putha piku to do the dirty work against tamils population.
The way he is answering the question quite funny … you you you 😂😂😂
Wow. Medhi as usual at his best!
First and foremost, this discussion extended well beyond two hours, as confirmed by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a press conference. The way the discussion was edited appears to undermine his role and significance.  To begin with, the program presenter lacked the patience and professionalism required to conduct a balanced discussion. The audience mainly consisted of individuals with affiliations to the LTTE, a known terrorist organization, which continues to have active networks in the UK and Europe. While there may be no direct evidence of LTTE funding for this program, anyone watching can clearly see that the entire discussion was well-scripted and strategically executed. The individuals who posed questions and provided explanations appeared uninformed about the true history of the conflict, seemingly acting according to a pre-arranged script.  The Sri Lankan ethnic war was financially and strategically influenced by external entities, including India, the UK, and European nations. Various forms of international sanctions against Sri Lanka further strengthened the opposition. Historically, India played a role in training and arming the LTTE, which eventually led to the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. In the final stages of the war, thousands of lives were lost as both sides fought for survival—Sri Lanka in defense of its sovereignty and the LTTE for its own agenda.  The journalist conducting the discussion appeared to follow a pre-planned script, but the execution was poorly organized. The questions lacked logical flow, and the presenter consistently interrupted Ranil Wickremesinghe, preventing him from providing detailed responses. This suggests a deliberate effort by the organizers to limit his ability to articulate his thoughts effectively.  Furthermore, a woman named Rasarathnam, who was involved in the discussion, had connections with the LTTE and even served as an advisor to the group.  Overall, this discussion was deeply flawed due to conflicts of interest at multiple levels.  For further insights into the origins and operations of the LTTE, I recommend reading "Tigers of Lanka" by Narayan Swamy.
Good, job brother... We suffer in this world because of these politicians 🙏
In this podcast, 2 were trying to defend against everybody else planted to speak and argue against. Shame on u Al - jazeera
Translate this video for the sinhalese 😂😂
Ranil sent jail
This was a setup. Ranil did well in my opinion. Could have done better. Ranil isn't to blame of the crisis in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankans don't see the service he did to the country by reviving the economy.
Mehdi Hassan, as usual 🎉
*Ranil Wickremesinghe, the 6 time loser and full-time bootlicker 👢👅 of the Rajapaksas, walked into Mehdi Hasan’s interview thinking he could slither his way out, just like he does with Sri Lanka’s pathetic excuse for ‘journalists.’ Instead, he got intellectually dismantled on live TV 📺. And his strategy? Whining about the EU, Amnesty, and the UN while pretending they don’t matter when they expose his crimes. He delayed elections and tried to pass it off as a budgeting issue. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court even held him accountable for these actions while he continued undermining democracy. He claimed to oppose the Rajapaksas, then showed up at their birthday parties 🎉. Denied war crimes, then threw in a Gandhi quote as if that somehow erases the bodies. And what was his only response to actual accountability? ‘No contest,’ which, let’s be real, is probably the closest he’s come to winning an election in decades. The fact that this slippery, gutless fraud was ever taken seriously just shows how low Sri Lanka’s media has sunk. Mehdi Hasan did what our so-called ‘journalists’ never had the spine to do, make this clown 🤡 answer for the absolute state he left our country in. And to be fair, we can’t really blame Sri Lanka’s fake journalists like Chathura Alwis because they’re all bootlickers of the same kind. Anyways watching this scumbag 🤥 try to slither out of it was pure comedy 😂, though the joke has been on us for far too long.*
Excellent interviewing skills great job. These are the people who ruined a great nation. It’s a fun for them. Need to make sure these people are accountable
Hats off to the brave journalist exposed how this politician and others last 47 years ruin the country.
Thanks, Medi, for exposing the hypocrisy. As a Tamil who fled this genocide, I’m still searching for my two uncles—government servants captured by SL STF when I was 8. Now in my 50s, I have no confirmation of their fate!
What a despicable man is this? He is asking where is the report. The report clearly stated that Ranil Wickramasinghe must be PROSECUTED.
still he is lying....he ruined our country.....
Ranil held himself well but the journalist has drowned him by not allowing to complete his debate. He may be right or wrong previously but at least give him a chance to complete his sentence
Should take him to custody..  he is a big game player,
This is not an easy task, Ranil did well and well said. He is a well-experienced politician
How come he says that Malwatte Chief Monk is the leader of all religion s of Srilanka . Thats politics in the Buddhist sasana. He speaks of caste system in the Buddhist sasana.  Malwatte Thero always for UNP. So he made him the leader of all religion s of Srilanka . Shame on you Ranil.
Well done Ranil Wickramasinghe Sir
This fellow had no knowledge to lead the country.he had 39 advisors & according to their advises he just spend a cosy life with peoples money.
Ranil Wikramasingha  is Joker. Future Sri-Lankan people.
Chamudhitha English version😂
Why on earth is this guy not giving enough time to answer questions and shouting like a madman?
Ranil wekramsigha ist the batalanda killer hie ist the murde in srilanka yourth 88/89 in srilanka  we are  the evedens
He must go to jail
He is tesponsible for most crimes in Sri Lanka thats why he was not the president by the people but Rajapalsha thieves
What an embarrassment. Why did he even come on here? This reminds me of old Sri Lankan uncles that can’t take an ounce of criticism and just rambles and lies when questioned.
Supub Supub aljazeera
He is a murderer, manipulator and a toturer. He tried to intimidate the interviewer as he usually does but failed.
The recent history should not be twisted by deflecting the blame for what happened during the conflict on this politician, who is not to blame for it whether one likes him or not. It was not mentioned for example that the LTTE is a terrorist group that committed brutal crimes against thousands of Tamils and Sinhalese, pioneered suicide bombing, used child soldiers, slaughtered innocent civilians including children from all ethnicities, and killed most Tamil leaders during that time. It's like ignoring a major element of the conversation. Tamils and Sinhalese have suffered, and the causes are multiple.   I felt these one sentence questions with no context and expecting 2-3 word answers is silly. Mehdi Hasan kept interrupting as soon as he felt contradicted. I’m not a fan of this politician but I understand his frustration.
Grandfar.. shutdown 😂
Well done Mehdi
This man is wrong when he says "I was freed from the Easter Sunday attack". The Supreme Court was compelled to exclude him from the case because there was a clause in the Constitution to say that the President cannot be prosecuted while holding that position. It is open now for the new Government to prosecute him.
He is a criminal and a thief, along with the Rajapaksa crime mob. Fake president.
Al Jezeera not Hiru or Derana 😂
Dear everyone, Whatever Ranil says, is not correct as he always lied for their personal prosperity. He & all past political parties, never thought of prosper on the country. They enjoyed their life to full by using countries tax payers money. Having all the luxurious life. Having all enjoyable foreign trips, looked after their health very well in foreign countries by using tax payers money. That is all Ranil did  in all his parliment positions with in this 76 years using tax payers money.  Hide all these evidance with his power stealing all the records. Listen to things coming out from current COPE investigations what he has done. One of the Very corrupted political leader  in Sri Lanka worked with Premadasa & Rajapaksas families for only all their luxury life unfortunately. Very sad to hear what happened in the past to Sri Lanka.
Ranil attended well
Please teach English to Ranil who thinks I am smart guy to deal all 😅
you are a great interwiver. Thank you so much
Invite MR PRESIDENT AKD
Fabulous
Bravo MEHDI!!
Mr ranil big time liars
Edited Video 😂😅
Ranil Rajapaksa is a dog that has brought destruction to Sri Lanka. The most brutal man I have ever seen
He is lying even he is the main responsible person about Batalanda and so many  Innocent people killed by he is order it's true .
Firstly, Gaza cannot be compared to the situation in Sri Lanka. Secondly, the LTTE, a terrorist organisation, used innocent civilians as human shields and fired artillery from hospitals. The word genocide is used loosely by LTTE sympathisers and LTTE members who now live in the western countries. Tamils have been treated unfairly, which was one of the root causes of the civil war. The civil was prolonged and intensified primarily by India. This is unfortunately a complex issue, which needs to be resolved as one Sri Lanka one country.
This guy is a devil he supposed to be jail?????
the journalist's meticulous research left Ranil at a rare loss for words... well done !!
Since when al Jazeera starred bring babies to interviews
Ranil wikramasingha is dirty politician part of the genocide terrorist hypocrisy....
This one need with sinhala subtitles for understand all of Sri Lankans 🙂 සීයා ඉන්ටර්නැශනල් පච උනා හැබැයි 😂
I completely lost the respect I had for Mehdi Hassan as a journalist. He was acting Piers Morgan in this interview, not letting the Ex SL president to  explain him at all, and forcing his prejudiced opinions and false facts on him. False facts about pretty much everything- even trying to imply that a trip to a funeral by the president could be exchanged for the cost of an election. How he tried to justify a western backed power grab he is all too familiar with from Ukrain to Middle East - I could see the hypocrisy of his lefty face he often shows
The white collar Crook & Cunning fox that should be punished!!! ⚖️  Ranils tenure has been overshadowed by numerous controversies, including the tragic burning of the Jaffna Library in 1981, largest library of Asia at that time, a tragic loss of 95,000 rare books. He was the Education Minister back then. 📚  Then unresolved cases of missing persons during Sri Lanka’s civil war, and his administration’s failure to prevent the devastating Easter Sunday bombings in 2019. The attacks, which killed over 250+ people and injured hundreds (including foreign tourists), exposed severe intelligence lapses, with Wickremesinghe claiming he was “out of the loop” despite prior warnings. These events highlight a troubling lack of accountability and justice under his leadership as the PM. 💣  Yahapalana Government failed miserably just because of his ego and superiority mindset. 💩  Finally, as the President he also saved Rajpakshe clan of thieves and paved the way for them to re-enter the country and politics after moving all their assets and wealth to Namibia. 🥷🏻 🇳🇦   He always wanted to cling onto the power at any cost, even at the disposal of his very own party UNP. 🐘  His 50+ years of political career caused the mess, and is one of the key reasons why country’s economy collapsed, thousands killed, and millions migrated. 📉⚰️🛫
Glad to see he is being held accountable for the crimes this smug face has committed against the country, no respect for the victims - SHAME ON YOU!
Ranil rjapacksha all one family
It's damning.... his demeanor is the personification of our past government.... We can only hope and pray the new model of government we have steer well away from this and and new reforms take place
BS, this looks like a plan to roast Ranil on global scale. And that idiot wont even let Ranil to finish his answers. I don't know and has no proof to say Ranil is good or evil. but the Al Jazeera needs to learn manners . the whole interview looks like a one sided coin.
ha ha ha,got caught to the  real person to question this crook. Wish every single Sri Lankan watch this interview. 😂😂😂😂
Can Al-Jazeera please translate this in to Sinhala language and share
Commision reports like Hutson report and Blair's War crime like .. all criminals are going un punished
Very biased.
As a son of my nation, I felt deeply ashamed after watching this interview. Seeing our leader struggle under tough questioning was truly embarrassing. By the way, @AlJazeera, could you please post the full interview? I highly doubt? it might be longer than that! it’s only fair as a journalistic platform to provide complete transparency. A 50-minute edit might not show the full picture!
This is ranil rajapaksa  because rajapaksa family friend
All Srilanka money ranil house
Dont mess around with eradication of evil tiger terrorism ! Country was suffering from tgeir evilism n brutality for 3 decades. Innocent civillians were murdered cold blooded everyday. Innocent villagers were hacked to death including new borns n pregnant mothers. Govt has to put an end to this endless misery. This is what any country would do, if terrorism exists in their countries. So do not shed cricodile tears for the sake of terrorists. Its them , who used their own Tamil people as human sheilds and govt forces had to go through rather difficult missions to protect civillians. Dont blame unnecessarily. Many people who claimed to be missing, are living happily in many European countries and Canada. If you are worrying about, please do worry about the innocent civillians whos   lives were taken away by terrorists for long 30 years. Compansations should be paid for them, but unfirtunately they were all  murdered merciless.
Isn't this a Hamas channel  ?
Al Jazeera is once again spreading propaganda, trying to paint Sri Lanka as a country with ongoing ethnic conflict. This is the same media that helped the Taliban rise to power, supports Hamas, and continues to spread false narratives. While I strongly dislike Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Rajapaksas, I have to admit that Ranil did a great job shutting down these baseless allegations. That being said, he should never have agreed to an interview with someone like Mehdi Hasan, whose extremist ideologies make him a biased and low-quality journalist. Sri Lanka has moved forward from its past, and the current government is leading the country into a new era.
Srilankan leadership  doesn't like to solve the tamils community issues lands occupied by military forces support it by srilankan putha piku high command  and the government  ministers chanl 4 Called Srilankan military forces killing field innocent tamils millions.
Ppppp
MR. Ranl is look like MR BEAN! IS IT?
JVP broke the country to get power. Foolish people voted for them and suffering.
This ranil idiot  This ranil fire Jaffna library
Very good 👍 thank you so much for al
😂😂😂
Ranil Wickramasinghe killed the guy in at the end of the interview saying that “ Mr. Mehidi must be better mannered “ Intelligent and experience counts’
Al jazeera is partial trouble maker .they know nothing about srilankan history or politics talking based on  l.t.t.e  s false  data like they know ultimate truth.talking nonsense. Ranil could have refiused this bullying.
කැම්‍ රි වැඩ කරන්න එපා යකො සීයට.එන්න කියල ඔහොම කරනවද
It’s So DISAPPOINTING to see the HOST WHO STANDS FOR THE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE to Interview this piece of dirt and his associates
@aljazeeraenglish it is entertaining, Rani is corrupted politician in Sri Lanka who doesn’t second to Rajapaksa, yet he is masterminded, I felt this is like his another well planned , staged move and you all played us here.
This a dirty political in South Asia all this happened behind seen Indian.
Nariya interview
These two INDIVIDUALS ARE FRAUDSTERS , THIEVES AND MURDERERS
No one curuption, Ranil Wickramasinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksha,the former two presidents are to be blamed for the collapse of SRI LANKA m
That lady very well know where she allocated money and she is so disappointed and sad.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a murder. Killed hundreds of innocent people under political revenge. “Batalanda” torture chamber is the classic example. He also responsible for corruptions over billions of dollars.   People of Sri Lanka rejected him within months, but now he is planning to come to the power again safeguard himself and his political friends such as Rajapakse family.
He is a shame to this beautiful country !!

While I fully agree Ranil is a poor leader and a failed politician, Al Jazeera running a LTTE favourable narrative on this program is quite appalling. If only this interview was done unbiased with the exact same questions, it would have been a gem to watch and a true depiction of Ranils failures. By making this interview a LTTE driven, you've tainted the whole impression of the intended subject of the program. Ranil will go home and now say '' this was a LTTE driven interview'' and Al jazeera would loose thier credibility. You could have atleast tried to appear unbiased. What a waste of effort.
Why are these media inviting this crook for intervew ?. Because he can speak English ?. Apart from that nothing good about him. He is accused of maintain torture camps (google batalanda commission report )during 1988 youth uprising and so many othet curruptions over the years. He never had the mandate to become  a president. It is funny that international media use this guy to represent the country , this man never had and naver have any empathy or concern about the people of the country. ම්ලේච්ඡ පොම්න පිස්සෙක් මූ
First time in ranil rajapaksha history   Ranil got stacked 😮
This is not Chamuditha to talk about Netflix’s 😂😂😂😂😂
Dude is being COOKED 😂😂😂😂  Ranil W has always been a puppet with a malicious agenda. He's a corrupt POS.
Just a heads up—he might sell your seats! 🍰 for cake.
We don't like Cunning ranil either Respect aljazeera🫶🏻 Al-Jazeera is better than channel 23 or something. Aljeezeera is neat and not for territorest .
Joker
What was your motive in this exercise? If you want your audience to get the other person's response better, give him time and space rather than being arrogant. Your motive of making the other uncomfortable and uneasy was well observed.
Respect to the journalist❤️ this old man is a poison to sri lanka
Ranil batalandhe needs to leve 😂 within 5 minutes 😅😂no answers ranil raja paksha mr mehadi Hassan Al so calling to mr Ranil raja paksha 😂😂😂
ASK MARVAN ATAPATTU GO 4k his self
Ranil is no good too much Harami Alibaba Anil big Alibaba
Great personality
Lol LTTi programme, nice move.. first be in India with Good manners and harmony not that rich are rich poor are poor ... LTti is not Tamil . Tamil is not LtTi . LtTi is a territories agency. Don't play with people and specially with Tamil people .. And Dnt get diaspora to your living.
Well done aljaseera he is muder in 1989 biyagama
NIRJ DEVA also known as NIRANJAN DEVA ADITYA - is the MOST CORRUPTED, individual in the SRI LANKAN HISTORY.  Alongside of RANIL WICKRAMASINGHE , NIRJ always STRUCK DEALS with all the ANTI GOVERNMENT parties to MAKE HIS MONEY.  Nirj was voted into the EU parliament and used that as a leverage for MAKING HIS OWN MONEY by helping our country in avoiding SANCTIONS and getting himself on the BOARD OF DIRECTORS list in several SRI LANKAN business entities helping them to avoid sanctions and taxes.  He Also used his connections to sell his aquatiences for a fee. Eg : He got TONY BLAIR to PERSONALLY visit a PRIVATE COMPANY NAMED “ SUPREME GLOBAL HOLDINGS” in Sri Lanka to give them prominence and some breaking news for a fee of USD 150k.  He also got Sir DESMOND DESILVA to save the RAJAPAKSA’s from war crimes.  Sir Desmond was paid USD 1Mn per month out of the SRI LANKAN EPF money.  Nirj is EXTREMELY CORRUPT and some authorities should check his FINANCIAL ASSETS.
Like most leaders RW is a psychopath
39.39 he gave the exact answer. I mean what on earth these LTTE people expect. I wonder the new president will be able to give such an answer even if it is asked in Sinhala language. Looks like Sri Lanka just missed an opportunity to have him for 5 consecutive years.
Best part is stated  by  an audience “ bunch of muppets and headed by a joker ‘
All the friends of the last Parliament, Ranil's, how can they make peace with these problems
Ranil never had an idea or intention of poor Sri Lanka, and their development, he always wanted maintain his class, This class never wanted to see poor family children become doctors of lawyers,  they beloved it should be from his class, stupid .
Mehdi, please host a "Head to Head" episode with Dr. Muhammad Yunus on the Bangladesh crisis after Hasina’s departure on Aug 5, 2024. The world needs to hear his insights on the country's future!
Sri Lanka no 1 actor ranil.
He is a shame to all the Sri Lankans! Audience is laughing and   seeing him as a joker. Today he was interviewed by a proper journalist. SL journalists will never expose him like this. Good. He lost   all the cards.
The question is correct, but let him talk before you answer; you're interrupting.
Grazie Al jazera
Ranil LED batalanda
Our hard earned money deposited with the Banks for getting interest for our survival was taxed. Why?
Bunch of Muppets headed by joker 😂
🔴 පොර වෙන්න අල්ජසීරා සාකච්ඡාවට ගිහින් 💩 නාගෙන ආවා...පොනිලා වැඩ්ඩා කියල හිතන් ඌට වදින උන්ට නියම වැඩේ උනේ... රනිල් කියන්නේ එකෙන්ම හිරේ ඉන්න ඕන තක්කඩියෙක්😡
Ranil Wickramasingha is a disgrace to Sri Lanka.. He will never retire from politics. He is a power hunger man. Kudos to this young man …
I'm a Sinhala Buddhist, and these are the questions that should have been asked long ago to address the issues and bring justice to the country. I was part of the Aragalaya protest in Sri Lanka, and I know how cunningly he became the president with the support of the corrupt Rajapakshas. Now the world has seen just 1% of the corruption carried out by these so called experienced politicians. I'm really happy that all these long hidden topics, especially the Batalanda issue, are finally being brought to light. All I'm asking from the world is to pray for us to have a better country with true justice, free from corruption.
18:09 😂😂😂
What a masterpiece by Al Jazeera! It’s so satisfying to see the mastermind behind all the political and economic corruption become speechless in front of an international audience. Finally, he met a real journalist who had done his proper homework and presented unbiased arguments that could properly challenge him.
You should at least let him answer the question. Always talking over and moving on to the next question. What's the point of interviewing then?
These are all same bunch of group looting people's money. These are the people who's responsible economic crisis and drag to a economic collaps.
If you can find the bank accounts of those who are so called Tamil rights activists, you can get a pure idea how much they are concerned about Tamil people in Sri Lanka.
Thank u al Jazeera
Shame on Al Jazeera You need better journalists!
What a shameless person this guy is 😡😡😡
He (Ranil ) is political prostitute and thief...... He is biggest"  🦊 fox " .. Everyone will understand From his answer... நரி வேலை செய்யும் மிக கொடிய விரோதி இந்த நாய்...
Thank you Aljazeera to remove his wolf cover.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ranil Rajapaksha 😂 🦊
Pissu hutta
He is a murderer , we all know it. He destroyed evidence but that doesn’t mean he is clean
Ranil is a very good drama actor he needs to go holly wood industry
PM has a say in judiciary
Good job Mehdi..good job..❤❤ definition of head to head.. watch the video..you will get the answer
Hats of Mehedi Hassan for the true journalism ... Finally faced off a killer psychopath and a joker
He talks like a hero. But wgat heroism is there? This is the man behind many wrongdoings in SL. From Batanada massacares to robbing the Central bank, he is the respinsible culprit. He boasts about rescuing SL economy , but he taken more loans whilst witholding paying back to patch up  the economy temporily. SL will have to pay double price for what he did. People know him very well, thats why he  never gets elected by people. He should be actually in the prison, not govern the country at all!
What can simply say, This man ruined srilanka for decades with rajapaksahas
The Criminal Rajapakse should be questioned like this and brought to justice
Big thanks for  Al-Jazeera!❤🇱🇰
Good questions asked. Most of the politicians are not truthful when they take over the leadership. At the end they have to face a situation like what Ranil has faced today. Overall it is a failure to them at the end of their life.
Even his English sucks 😁😊
How about the corruption during his rule
This man is a puppet of Rajapaksha. 5 minutes into this interview you have to see his arrogance and anger towards his people. He had done nothing for the country but stealing and destroying sri lanka along with the Rajapaksha and his cronies!!! I would not give this man any time or space to run his propaganda and lies. No media should interview or air the lies coming out of this man's mouth! He is as much as other political dynasties responsible for the destruction of Sri Lanka. He is part of the gang of thieves who stole every dime from that beautiful country.
everyone is saying he's the one having a biggest brain in Asia. But today it's empty. Thank you so much. Al jazeera
ASK THE CATHELIC CHURCH WHO GOT THERE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE JVP. TO ASK THEM... BLOODO LOOSER ALJAZZERa
Beautiful and excellent interfere.  Before becoming the president he supported the protesters he has conveniently forgotten?
සිංහල උපසිරැසි එක්කර ජාතික රූපවාහිනියේ විකාශනය කළ යුතු සාකච්ඡාවක්
I strongly believe and also shown with this interview as another comedy its very funny to watch also if someone sits that type of interview his fate also decide before he was being interviewed 😂
I saw him singing at his (rajapaksha)  birthday party 😂😂😂😂😂 that's my boy😂😂
Ranil was definitely a corrupted politician... but this program is nonsense.. 😂😂
This interviewer is absolutely correct. Ranil such a shame on you .This interview should be translated to Sinhala. Sirasa Tv can do that .
terrorist supporters cracking down on 80 year-old former politician
Thank to the people in Sri Lanka  that not let him to  represent the country anymore.😊
Respect ranil Wikaramasigha ❤️✌️💫
Ranil cooked 😂
Obviously an evil man.
Thank you for your news Al jazzera
😂😂😂he is not any responsible person😅😅... He has started his political journey in around 1995 and lost all his election campaign until 2015. Even 2015 he becomes prime minister through presidential election 😅😅😅....  This man is an idiot ..one of most corrupted politician in sri lanka. Even after crisis 2022.  He had 36 president advices😅😅😅😅 Which mean he dont know anything
It's a mystery as to why RWS is visiting the Indian pm so oftentimes when he is not even member of parliament.
ifd the Fu*****i** Rajapakses were in power, y da 4uk did they make Ranil the President?
Mr ranil rajapaksha don't have any evidence for any questions al  jseera bring wrong guy I guess
A murderer walking free
Actually, this was a good interview. ❤ I love this show.I’m from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰. You know, Ranil Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa are like silent serial killers in Sri Lanka. Not just these two, but almost all Sri Lankan politicians are like silent serial killers and money-eating machines. I’m really worried about one thing—no political party in Sri Lanka dares to reveal the truth because they all follow the same agenda. They protect these silent political serial killers.
Can’t believe he was facing Meidi Hasan. 😂Trump wouldn’t face him.
Crooks who made this country bankrupt just cannot be forgiven.
This is  disgrace . Child  is  being  interviewed
Only you had the nerve to ask that question, and as Sri Lankans, we bow our heads in gratitude to Al Jazeera.❤
there wasnt civil war there was terrorism. IF ltte pronounce as civil war ISIS also called as that
This man kill his own people Sinhalese JVP men and boys and Tamils to be in power. He is a snake and corrupt man.
Mehdi Hasan on Fire🔥🔥🗿💪
Ranil wasted a lot of the country's money, left people helpless, and helped those who carried out the pasku attacks.
You deserve respect, Al Jazeera. The presenter is very good. If a journalist in Sri Lanka asked that question, his body would not even be found the next day. Ranil Wickremesinghe is such a cruel man. Thank you again, Al Jazeera.
He is asking too many questions at once, leaving him no chance to explain. Let him explain, please.
Braa look at his body language. LOL
He is not a Buddhist. He is a murderer
Hats off to the Journalist.   Finally this Old grandpa met a real journalist.
All he did was support the criminal family and make money illegally 🤮
43:04 we we wee weee... 45:13 can I can I can can can I😅 This is great to dubstep 😂
This man thief........ central bank ......muder.......... thanks al Jazeera........
This guy says he is a Buddhist but he does not act like a Buddhist. It's a disgrace for the Buddhist community. 😢😢😢😢
I am not a fan of Mr.Ranil Wickramasinghe nor any other former or existing leaders of Srilanka. Thanks for revealing his poor accountability in bringing  peace and justice of Srilankan system. Why would you allow audience to ask questions to give an impression on that Srilanka is an anti Tamil nation.
this meeting like he think ranil or Sri Lankan like rob dirty  Do EU clean Do England clean  Thay are d robbers  Not us Even if u go to England u will find how thay act or rob our things Thay are not stand still to teach human rights 😅
Busted!
Al Jazeera is an Qatar based media network. If anyone in Sri Lanka who doesn't know  about history and propaganda of this media network must learn their history first.
Al Jazeera tries to dictate and not ready to listen. Highly uneducated and not capable of conducting a good interview. He  tarnished the image of Al Jazeera.
Interesting Interview !! Both played their role very well
Mehdi Hasan very bias as usual.
Ranil Rajapaksha . Shame on you .
Mr ranil you not served the county with good intentions you arrogant stupid another cheap politician full of lies what a muppets
They stole the money of the poor people, what can they say now? Wherever they go, they lie, cheat, steal, and have no shame,,,,,,,,, People understood and sent them all home,, Now there is a government of the people
Well prepared journalist, Ranil makes it a joke when he talks about the Easter Attack. The journalist asks not laugh when talk about how many people died from the Easter attack. 😢he has more humanity towards the dead people than this old grandpa. He has not even his political party when he lost. He should be ashamed.
Ranil no good person, HE THINK HOW EARN MORE MONEY AND PROTECT SRILANKA NUMBER ONE THIEF Former president Rajapaksha.,, THEY ARE JUST DESTROYED  SRILANKA NOT PROTECT   SRILANKA
In Sri Lanka, all questions are pre prepared by the interviewee .
Can you guys keep him? Please don't let him get back on the return plane
Salute to this journalist for asking these questions. Luckily you don’t live in Sri Lanka otherwise he would definitely do something to kill you.  Fortunately he was not in power when the protest was happening in 2022 due to economic crisis. If not he would have killed all these innocent young people again.  Batalanda mass killings were reported and Ranil was responsible for it.
😂😂😂
Winston was Ranils gay partner and people suspect that he was killed as he was planning to give evidence of this batalanda mass killing house to the commission.   batalanda report is still there and they recommended a court case against this criminal man Ranil
journalist must learn to be gentle
These criminal leaders made truckloads of money out of this war, not one little bit were they worried about the human loss , they are still living lavishly without a day in jail, corrupt leaders corrupt courts and justice systems, blood money.
He is lying through the whole interview as usual
Winston was Ranils gay partner and people suspect that he was killed as he was planning to give evidence of this batalanda mass killing house to the commission.  batalanda report is still there and they recommend a court case against this criminal man Ranil
China helped bulldosers to Bury 1000s of Tamils alived in bunkers who Hide from plane bombings & artilleri fire every day! Ukraina Lady pilot apologized to Tamilnaadu doctor regarding the Chensolai orphanage bombing! Russia too helped! Now all countries shd help Tamils get full Autonomy based on Indo-Lanka pact 1987! We need UNPF to help our self defence in NESL UC Tamil Region!
Ranil is a corrupt and dishonest person and unsuitable to be a prime minister or President. He is a family friend of Rajapacksha family..
I believe that all Sri Lankans should watch this interview in their own language. They will definitely be outraged by Rani’s false statements. He should be ashamed.
Beautiful, great questions and interview with evil citizen of Sri lankan
He’s just a power hunger mongrel
Why this fxxker been interviewed he fuxxked the srilanka for 30 years he will pay soon
නාකියා වෙවුලනවා😆😆😆
Fox Ranil  eventually was born before Mahadi Hassan but he understands you're a snake and back biting person... remember any leader should prepare before facing M.Hassan
Ranil Wickramasinghe should be in jail!, he fooled millions of Sri lankans and helped his jolly good friend MR to do whatever he wanted.
Ranil is a maniac who torchered and killed young men for his unconventional sexual desires to be fulfilled and why only tamil asking questions hundreds and thousands sinhalese were killed chopped up by so called ltte for practice by the rebels and all of those who are asking questions here are living in UK using so called refuge visa bcoz of the so called racist sri Lankans and sihalese but as per my knowledge their own God Ram killed Ravan who is a sinhalese king who was ruling sri lanka 7000 years ago so they asking for separate government in sri lanka is quationble bcoz they are foreigners from Indian continent who came to sri lanka
Ranil Wicramasinha one of the main person involved to destroy our country.
PM is a good stand up commedian....lol Thank God he is no longer president ! War CRIMINAL !!!
He is number one president from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 thank you president❤
This look likes a comedy episode rather than a questionnaire 😂
This media guy spoke on behalf of all Sri Lankans who suffered because of the greediness of the Rajapaksha family. Bravo 👏
I think Ranil wikramasimha will vomit, after the meeting due to uncomfortable questions is being asked by mehdi,  I see Ranil Wikramasinha using Buddhism as his shield against the questions. In Sri Lankan media except Sirasa TV are supporters of atrocious politics
Well done Ranil ❤ That arabic clown anchor  has  no manners
He is protector of the Rajapakshe Family. All together responsible for the crisis in Sri Lanka.
Ranil Karma paying you back 😂😂😂😂
Ranil wicramsinghe is the serious killer & killed so many young life during 1988/89. He pretending as good leader in front of international audience but he is so corrupt & mastermind of making internal issues to make country down.
The current government claims that Ranil Wickremesinghe had over 100 advisors during his presidency. After listening to this interview, I now understand his true capabilities. He struggles to answer questions directly, likely because he was involved in all the corruption and crises.
Brilliant Medhi. You exposed this cunning crook
It seems some tamil diaspora and al-Jazeera targeted one of the presidents of SL.
Ranil is a lier.
සීයට එන්න කියලා මෙහෙම බලු කරල දාන එක කැත වැඩේ හැබැයි
Really appreciate Mr Wickramasinha
This is a staged 👊
සජියාවත් ඉන්ටර්වීව් කරොත් හොඳ නැද්ද? 😅
Struck=stuck? Secatariat=secretariat?
Dude, 😆 no one should interview this moron. And he did not do anything.
Is Ranil crying 😂😂😂😂???  Well done reporter . Respect you.
Ranil is a sleezeball he found a way to go through the interview without taking an accountability.  The 'press' lost a golden opportunity too. Ask tough questions, staying away from the dog fight.
A miserable political thug.  did nothing for the country.
SriLankan people hate him far from Rajapaksha gangsters
If MR ranil ruled sl atleast 5 years. our country had to be one best economical country in south asia.
Batalanda mass murder ---  An Al Jazeera journalist asked whether it was you who established the torture chamber called Batalanda. During that interview, when Ranil Wickremesinghe completely denied everything related to Batalanda, the journalist questioned him again about a young man named Trincomalee Vincent Fernando, who had testified before the Batalanda Commission. At that moment, Ranil became agitated and responded angrily.  Winston Fernando, who was allegedly Ranil Wickremesinghe's lover, testified before the Batalanda Commission about his romantic relationship with Ranil, how he was deceived, and the horrific acts of torture that were carried out under Ranil's orders at Batalanda. This testimony was given in front of a panel of three judges. It was Chandrika Bandaranaike, a friend and relative of Ranil, who ordered that this statement be taken confidentially.  Ranil Wickremesinghe told Al Jazeera that Vincent Fernando never testified before the commission, which is true. Winston Fernando gave his testimony privately, and his statements were omitted from the commission’s report by his old classmates. However, the true testimony of Winston Fernando, which Ranil rejected, still remains either with the chairman of the commission or with Chandrika. Chandrika only used it to intimidate Ranil during the 1999 elections.  Two weeks after giving his statement, Winston Fernando was summoned before the Batalanda Commission, which had also called Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, a week before Ranil was to appear, Winston Fernando mysteriously died. Later, it was revealed that he was poisoned. The crime was committed by Sudath Chandrasekara, a police inspector who was Ranil Wickremesinghe’s chief security officer.  Detailed information about this incident is recorded in the book "Batalanda to Ginileema" by senior journalist Nandana Weeraratne.    ---
Ranil was not people’s elected President, he was brought to the presidency role by previous corrupt President Gotabaya who had been kicked out by the people. Ranil was highly corrupt politicians who also responsible for having torture centres and killing thousands around the country. During his presidency, he had spent billions of taxpayer money on him, his family and friends to maintain their luxury lifestyle. Disgraceful politician ever 🤮
Flying over to uk to get baked
Great questioning 👋👋👋 good al jazeera
Rani is a two face evil  . He love killing young boys & girl. During 88, 89 he had a killing house but we can’t prove that.  He is no friendly man to any human. He is nothing but thug .. Ranil hate young people
Ranil is a killer
He had to take a battalion to all those unnecessary functions...he could have gone alone for the funerals. He shows he's so confident, but canmot go alone 😀
This man is responsible for ruining a beautiful country.
One of the worthy conversations every Sri Lankan should listen to
Thanks for.that wonder insight Mahdi We came to know the watchdog of Rajapakse. He proved Ranil Rajapakse
No one in Sri Lanka has stamina to face any interview like this other than RW.
If you have guts ask questions from trump in this way. on that day,  You will learn a lesson
It’s insulting to not only him but to Sri Lankans to see their former president even if they dislike him been bullied by this bully of an interviewer, asking questions then speaking over him and putting words in his mouth. Funny how UK gets arrested for posting opinions online and he’s worried about Sri Lanka.
Top notch journalism from Mehdi Hasan ...Bravoo💥
And still, the GMO is wishing for him, shame!
This dude never interview a EU politician or US one like this. This is part of the EU agenda to get MCC back. They are destroying every capable person who can give leadership the natiion. F*** Off Al Jazeera.
Saddest part of story is they never get punished by law in Asian countries, they know how to twist turn people head against each other. But one thing they really good players
Something for the sri lankan so called journalists to watch and learn.
Loved every minute of this!
රනිල්  කළේ  රාජපක්ෂ  රකින්න  , මහ ජනතාවට  කරදර  කල  එක . හොරුන්ට   ලොකු  ආඩාර  මුදල්  දුන්න  එක .  හොර  නායකයා . රට  වික්කා  . කම්බ  හොරු . Please don’t lie enough lies. People spoke en Thugs and criminals
Ranil wickremesinghe was a big killer in 1988 - 1990. He killed lot of young people at that time
My goodness, how this liar can sleep in the night
Ranil was one of most biggest cause for Sri Lanka’s problems
My favourite journalist ❤
Just give him a chance to talk interviewer :( That's very annoying to hear you talking amidst his answer.
He is disgrace
Fantastic journalism
why intrviewer not giving time to answer him..
This interview is what I call a dog fight 'balu poraya'. It is just noisy. Nobody got hurt. Nothing accomplished.
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE MORE OPEN INTERVIEWS IN SRILANKA BY OUR LOCAL MEDIA, THIS IS 2025,
Mr. Been, he didn’t take any questions seriously! This man had been leads this country for decades, doesn’t know how to directly answer the questions , instead merry go round.
Well done Mehdi. You have studied Sri Lankan history very well. Hats off to you
He is liyar
😮
Why nobody asking who about central bank rob..He will runaway then🤣
Mehdi my bro ❤❤❤❤ You have earned the absolute respect of Sri Lankans who knows about this man’s evil side starting from Batalanda camp atrocities
SHUT UP & LISTEN YOU DUMB FOOL. Let the man you invited for the interview speak Single sided terror mongers.
Ranil big thief leader
All us Sri Lankans have gathered here to see Ranil finally get his just desserts. Finally. Bon appetit!
රනිල් සීයා අද මොකද බය වෙලා.. 😂😂😂😂
COURUPTION 💯by the politicians .
Hats off to Al Jazeera for exposing this corrupt man.
Mehdi hats off
"Many puppets are headed by a joker" 😂😂😂
Corruption king Lol
Srilanka hitler 🤬
There was no civil war existed in Sri lanka.
Still thinks stupid jokes and laugh will help to dismiss any questions that bro have no answers... But this is not Sri Lankan interviewer.. Glad about that
Most of the kids are young age, even after they grow up, still mentally affected. Can't sleep peaceful
Ranil 😍
Al Jazeera next gng to seek hw current government totured civilians and government officers,brutally, and killing theros,only allowing  to take the bodies below the knee level,in 1983 even they dnt allow Dr to attend to hospitals,where they wore sarongs and attend to hospitals to help to mothers who were screaming with pain at giving birth, Doctors used to shut mothers mouth from pillows to avoid the screaming(this was a incident, which was faced by my family)  Brutality at max
Please dont trust he's words. Runil is murdered leader
Islam is blame
Mr . Ranil you are so foolish and useless
Hats to maidi Hasan & Thanks to Al jazeera To bring out the Tamils genocide,Srilankan rulers thought that the world is blinded.
Sri Lankan journalists shiver when they talk to such Murderers, Underworld politicians. Never asked such questions ever Hats off to Al Jazeera Thank you Mehdi Hasan
බටලන්දෙ රනිල්ගෙ කලිසම ඔලුවෙන් ගලවපු මාධ්‍යවේදි මහතාට මාගේ ප්‍රණාමය 🙏
Should have given time to Mr Ranil to answer. This is unfair. Dirty show
BBC reporter hatsoff you knowledge about srilankan politics
This guy is and has been corrupted as the same as Rajapakshas. He was one of the set backs for the crisis in Sri Lanka.
He IS STILL A JOKER😂
Sad to see people of sri lanka cheering to those who try to deliver agenda of the diaspora. Exactly what Trump said on how Aliens can hijack a government. Kudos to RW for his stance on united country.
I don't know about SLanka Politics  But about those terrorists & Catholic priests ,This Aljzera guy know everything about terrorists Because he lives in Qatar. As  a European citizen now days free speach is Limited. And quatar etc sponsored terrorism is common in Europe. And to those UK professionals, i ask go and take walk in Khans East /South London etc etc.  Aljzera needs professional approach to subjects. Morning Talk 🦜 about Democracy, Eveng funds Terrorism. 🤑 . Amnesty is s failed org. And a political org. Very unpopular in Europe. Total waste of tax payers moneys 🤑.
Journalism at its finest. Impressed. 🔥
The Most Interesting part 9:35 😂
There was no accountability at all,  Ranil wasn’t serious from the start he looked liked he was in a comedy show….
RW: 1987 Thoddangala torture Camps! 1981 Jaffna DDC election killings & destructions of Jaffna library 1983 Tamil pogrom in Colombo & rest of SL by voters list! 1977 attack! Helping 60 Dictators ITJP Jasmin Sooka list,!
If someone says this guy is a journalist, he or she is making a big mistake. This guy should have been sent to a fish market to sell fish. He thinks his shouting & screaming is journalism & he could become an interviewer by shouting at the interviewee. He is barking like a rabid dog!
He was in parliment for nearly 50 years 6 time prime minister and one time president. But country end up bankrupt in 2022.. He still argueing he is not responsible for people in lanka. Such a arrogont lier
Good job on defending country   Had to defend all good and bad done by Sri Lankan politicians during war period
Like chamuditha 😂😂😂😂
Great Job Mehdi Hasan and Aljazeera❤🤝.
Hats off to Mr.Wickramasinghe ♥️ The final statement was on point 😂
Try doing this type of Interview with Putin or Trump. Terrorist and asylum seekers in Audience. Leave Sri Lanka and it’s sovereign alone and mind your own business.
Pacha aathaa ( පච ආතා)
He is not a Buddhist
This man Ranil is arrogant and so corrupt. Some of his incredibly corrupt actions by appointing 39 presidential advisors for him, just to give them massive benefits while people were starving. The list of his despicable actions are very very long!
Fck Aljashitra! Respect to Mr.Ranil who saved Sri Lanka!
Sad to see the majority sinhala is dancing to these falls allegations
Asia's great crafty fox
This guy was a big part of the problem. This is like asking Diddy about child safety 😂
Ranil Met British Version of Chamuditha. Mehdi Hasan. School boy debater often roasted by other similar school boy debaters who have a opposite view.
These clowns are playing the people by showing as if they are against, but in fact they are very good friends
Ranil = Rat 🐀
Wow, the journalist 🫡 Thank you so much, man! I don’t think Mr. Ranil has ever seen a real journalist in his life lol 😂
hi
Thank you for doing a fantastic interview Al Jazeera, but, still he know how to cheat poor people, come to the power and be a corruption king. And also keep the rajapaksha's party as oppotion to keep the power in turns. They all got shameless baberic mind set.
Most Disgusting Person in Sri Lanka.
No contest, what does it mean
The man who never get shocked over baseless allegations. Thank yu for standing by the nation. RW ❤️
You need a lot of practice to have that fake smile. The gift of the gab without shame.31:00 This guy is part of the problem of 75 years of destruction in Sri Lanka.
Ranil is the worst criminal leader Sri Lanka had. A murderous leader who instigated Tamil riots, supported embezzlement, corruption and nepotism and killed innocent Sri  Lankan youth, running a torture camp in Batalanda. He, in all his life time destroyed Sri Lanka,  dreams of many Sri Lankans holding highest offices, using notorious criminals to stay in power. He belong in jail.
Is he mr bean,,, looks like he is 😂
We Respect free journalism as demokratikal equal rights for all countries., without any different around the world.
His deal with Rajapaksha family coudnt hide
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe only had three answer to every problem  Selling asserts  Accumulating debt Collecting taxes
ranil always  saying  about economics , education, something. but he dont know how to do them. the country went back word for a long time ...
HE DID NOT SAVE SRI LANKA FROM CRISIS - IT WAS HIS PLOT TO DESTROY THE STUPID GOTA'S GOVERNMENT - RANIL & HIS FAMILY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNFALL OF LANKA
Our proudly one of the best old political leader Ranil from 🇱🇰😁🍌
Respect for the jounalist....
You just put whole conversation not edit one , your strong part only you guys put
do not trust ranil.. he is a friend of Rajapaksha  for a long time. they want to take only political power.
රට කාපු කාලකන්නියා jr යි මූයි මහින්දයයි තමා අපේ රට විනාශ කලේ කාලකන්නියා
9:27 😂😂😂 17:24 27:17 38:07 45:12
Agenda of?
Hatsoff Mr. Mehdi Hassen💪
This Interview should be telecasted in local channels in Srilanka so that Ranil Rajapakshas Fans would atleast get to know about this joker.
He thought wrong 😂 RANIL LEFT 😂😂
Whats wrong with this chanel to interview this looser....
He is biggest culprit... Hes not even deserved to be a parliament member ... He saved rajapaksha family who shattered country
He bought inflation from from 70% to 1.3%....Huge achievement   many diaspora who hate SL is jealous of honorable Ranil
He like all time make problem in srilanka
The way RW behaved on stage evading questions acting in a childish manner is not something u expect of a former head of state. It's absolutely disgusting to see how our country is being brought to shame on the world stage by our former president
Bro thought it's "Talk with Chamuditha" 😂
This guy never let the guest finish his answer! It’s was dreadful to watch. And that woman should also write a book about her countries war crimes around the world.
No one can't mess with the Oxford's students ❤
All the Sri Lankans should understand this interview, so please translate
All those mocking Ranil sir they should remember who single handedly pulled Lanka from collapse 😌😌 I promise you this isn't a rage bait
Please can you have an interview with Rajapaksha like this
If anyone wanted to know what agenda journalism means this interview is an example of that, any answer that doesn't fit their agenda is shouted down upon, poor choice on part of ranil for not doing his research about the program he's participating in.
No one like ranil vikramasiha in srilanka
RANIL  RAJAPKSE  CAN LIE  AS USUAL.  LOOK AT RANILS FACE HE SHOWS GUILTY.  SO RANIL RAJAPAKSE        NO ESCAPE FROM GOD  AND  ADK AND PEOPLE.  TAKE A BRAKE GET OUT OF LANKA SO LANKAN CAN LEAVE IN PEACE. GIVE ALL THE MOENY YOU ROBBED FROM CENTRAL BANK. YOU LOOSER BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The worst and the cunning politician leader , only doing good for himself and his colleagues😡🤬😡🤬, such a selfish guy , hate him😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬
He is the main culprit who protects Rajapaksha. Mostly, they are relatives, and he has ruined the whole country for being in the parliament for 77 years. He is the head of Corruption.
Singhalese government is all corrupt 🙄
*The Damdeepa Policy: A Historical Engine for the Structural Genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka*  Sri Lanka's political and cultural landscape has been significantly influenced by the ancient text, the Mahavamsa, which has served as a cornerstone for shaping the country's identity. For centuries, this chronicle, which narrates the story of the Sinhalese people and their divine right to rule the island, has played an instrumental role in crafting the Sinhala-majority narrative. However, for Eelam Tamils, this text is not merely a history book; it is a powerful ideological tool that has been used to justify their marginalization and oppression. Central to this process is the Damdeepa policy, a political framework that advocates for a Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lanka, and in turn, has paved the way for the systematic suppression and genocidal actions against Tamils.  Mahavamsa: A Tool for Political Exclusion  The Mahavamsa, an ancient chronicle written in the 6th century, traces the history of Sri Lanka from its mythical founding by Prince Vijaya to the rule of King Dutugemunu, who is venerated as a national hero for his conquest of the Tamil Chola kingdom. The narrative, deeply rooted in Buddhist ideology, frames the Sinhalese as the rightful rulers of the island, with a divine duty to protect Buddhism. In the Mahavamsa, Tamils are often portrayed as enemies or foreign invaders, and this portrayal has played a critical role in constructing a Sinhalese-only identity that has left little room for Tamil aspirations.  For Sinhalese nationalists, the Mahavamsa has been employed as a political justification for the dominance of the Sinhalese majority over other ethnic groups, particularly the Tamils. It has cemented the belief that the Sinhalese people hold a divine right to the island, creating an ideological framework that frames Tamil struggles for autonomy, self-determination, and equality as rebellious and illegitimate. This deeply ingrained political philosophy, embedded in Sri Lankan history and politics, has caused the marginalization of Tamils, especially those in the northern and eastern provinces.  The Damdeepa Policy: Fueling Tamil Marginalization and Erasure  The Damdeepa policy, or the "Island of Light" policy, is a direct extension of the ideologies rooted in the Mahavamsa. This policy embodies the vision of a Sinhala-dominated Sri Lanka, where the Sinhalese identity is prioritized and Tamil identity is subordinated. It envisions Sri Lanka as an exclusively Sinhalese state, with Tamils viewed as a minority whose rights to autonomy, political power, and cultural recognition must be suppressed.  The Damdeepa policy has been used to politically exclude Tamils, economically marginalize them, and deny their linguistic and cultural rights. In its most brutal form, this policy justified the violence and discrimination faced by Tamils, both during the civil war and in its aftermath. From the beginning of Sri Lanka's post-colonial history, Tamils have been forced to navigate a system of governance that disregards their rights, driven by an ideology that asserts Sinhalese supremacy and seeks to erase the presence of Tamils from the island’s political and cultural narrative.  Eelam Tamils: Victims of a Historical Injustice  For Eelam Tamils, the influence of the Mahavamsa and the Damdeepa policy is not a relic of the past but a living, breathing force that continues to shape their daily existence. The historical narrative presented in the Mahavamsa has entrenched the idea of a Sinhalese-only Sri Lanka, leaving no room for the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil population. The political philosophy derived from this text has systematically excluded Tamils from the political process and undermined their quest for self-determination.  The Tamil struggle for a separate state of Tamil Eelam emerged as a direct response to this exclusion. The Tamil Eelam movement sought to create a state where Tamils could live in peace, free from the oppression and marginalization that had defined their existence under Sinhala rule. For many, the inability of the Sri Lankan government to address the grievances of the Tamil population, compounded by the ideological and political forces stemming from the Mahavamsa, amounts to a form of genocide. The displacement, violence, and denial of justice faced by Tamils are viewed as part of a larger ongoing process of erasure—a deliberate attempt to remove Tamils from the political and cultural fabric of Sri Lanka.  The Tamil Struggle: Challenging a Genocidal Narrative  Tamils view the denial of justice for the victims of the Sri Lankan civil war—particularly the atrocities committed in its final stages—as a continuation of a pattern of historical denial that stretches back to the very formation of the Sri Lankan state. The refusal of the Sri Lankan government to allow independent investigations into the war crimes committed by its forces, along with its failure to provide justice for Tamil victims, is seen as an extension of the systemic oppression of Tamils, rooted in the political philosophy of the Mahavamsa and the Damdeepa policy.  For Tamils, seeking justice is not only about addressing the atrocities of the war but also about challenging the ideological and political structures that have allowed such violence to persist. The fight for recognition, autonomy, and self-determination remains central to the Tamil cause, and the denial of justice is viewed as an ongoing act of historical erasure—a denial of the very existence and dignity of the Tamil people.  Conclusion: A Call for Justice and Recognition  The political philosophy that emerged from the Mahavamsa and was enshrined in the Damdeepa policy continues to have a devastating impact on the Tamil population of Sri Lanka. For Eelam Tamils, these ideologies have served as the foundation for systematic exclusion, discrimination, and the denial of their political, cultural, and social rights. The fight for justice, recognition, and self-determination cannot be separated from the historical context in which the Sinhalese-only state was created—one where Tamil identity was consistently undermined and erased.  Without meaningful recognition of Tamil rights, culture, and history, the cycle of marginalization and victimization will persist. The Tamil struggle for justice is a struggle against the continuation of a historical injustice—a struggle for the right to exist as a people with the dignity and recognition they are entitled to.  In the face of continued denial, it is essential for the international community to stand with the Tamils of Sri Lanka in their quest for justice, ensuring that the cycle of oppression and genocide does not continue for generations to come.

He s politics life rejected srilankan people's
Out of all politicians in Sri Lanka, this man is the most diplomatic decent politician. This man from an effluent society and lived a decent life. There are two aligation against this man. 1. Butalanda camp 2. Central Bank bond scam   There are no valid evedence.
As a SriLankan, I gratitude journalist for asking all the questions we want to asking from this inhumane leader. Even current government JVP has no guts to ask these questions from this man. Now, I heard that he has made a press release in SriLanka saying that he thought someone he liked would have done this interview, that's why he accepted this invitation. So funny, this shows how he govern the country in 40 years
This old man who destroyed a country gets angry at the truth
This clown talks about the parliament because that’s is where he hid doing all the abusive corrupt acts.
Srilanka people's gawarment
He was involved in the killing of 140,000 innocent Tamils ​​in the final war.
Mahinda Rajapaksha ranils relegation he like to make  femily gawarment but srilankan people's don't like family gawarment
He is another Sri Lankan Hitler, He is a murderer, His leader was murderer Premadasa, Who is father of current opposition leader. Both killed their own party higher position politicians to become a party leader. More than that.. He is called as Batatalanda Murderer, His is responsible for killing more than 67000 youth Sinhalese. Don't accept he as a human. Not only he is responsible for these killings, also theft. LTTE War is another separate killing history, his uncle (JR Jayewardena) started killing Tamils in 1983 and at the time this guy also involved burning Jafna Library and other crisis as well. After he took the power on 2015, He robbed own country Central Bank.
Thank you for exposing the real demon. Thankfully his attempts to distract the journalist became useless  21:06 he thought raising his voice will stop the journalist. Sadly he still smile with pride after everything :(
Thank you  Mehdi Hasan , If you are in Sri Lanka   but happening to you next day? luckily you save.🤗🤗🤗
They have to talk about how LTTE committed war crimes. Public Suicide bombers, killing innocent people, trained underage soldiers and many more warcrimes and yet LTTE is a legal party in united nations. No one talks about that. But ranil is not innocent and justice must be served.
Hats off to this brave journalist for questioning Ranil like this, being Sri Lankans we appreciate your effort
Ranil 💚 A good political player to govern Sri Lanka..., @aljazeera  upload the full video.
You're interviewing one of the f*king politicians "who is to blame for" 😂
A big shadow of currupted politicin in Sri Lanka.
Bravo Mehdi …. ❤ As a Sri Lankan , I’m truly happy that you had audacity to cornered this elite class political cockroach in front of a large audience like this….. ❤ true journalism .
Respect mr mehedi ❤
Sri Lankan Mr.Bean
Even if you are a born politician you can't hide your ugly face when you meet a real journalist face to face. Expecting to call Rajapaksa in future
😅
Aljasira was also in the conspiracy against previous government to destabilise the country .
Bro got violated
Never before has a prominent politician in Sri Lanka questioned this in such detail. I bow to you for this🫡
7.5  totally lying
All of a sudden, he is a Buddhist 😅
Al Jazeera, you need to recognize this ignorant and opportunistic politician who assumes that all reporters are there to serve him. He has been repeatedly rejected by the people in every election he contests, yet he somehow manages to become the opposition leader each time by making deals with the government. He is a symbol of Sri Lanka’s corrupt political culture and has faced multiple corruption allegations. And when he spoke about Buddhism, I nearly vomited. Watching this unfold brings me immense satisfaction
Ranil is a fox 🦊🦊 this person is a disgrace to Sri Lankan
ponnaya ponnayek bawa sihi wu mohothak 🤣🤣
I think it's first and last met with those journalist to Ranil he never ever meet again him 😂😂
Misleading Content Regarding Sri Lanka Dear Al Jazeera, I believe you have been misled by both the LTTE and the JVP in your coverage. Our country has suffered immensely due to these two terrorist groups, resulting in the loss of 200,000 lives and financial damages amounting to $2 billion. This is a major reason for our current economic crisis—not just corruption. More than 100,000 widows and half a million children have lost their fathers. Over 200,000 parents have lost their children. The JVP, in particular, played a key role in bringing the Rajapaksa family into power. Today, they are in governance. It was the JVP that encouraged the Rajapaksas to go to war. On the other hand, Ranil Wickremesinghe, during his tenure as Prime Minister, opposed war and sought political solutions to the ethnic conflict. He made significant efforts toward peace, with Norway acting as a mediator in the process. Please refrain from publishing misleading content that undermines the best politician our country has ever had. Accuracy and fairness are crucial to maintaining your journalistic integrity. Thank you.
Ranil was joker hear 😂
He thought that he is Chathura ( Journalist from Ada Derana/ Derana. TV )
Bro has thought it’s talk with Bombaymuttai kaaraya Chamuditha 😅
Good acting 😂😂
As a Sri Lankas ,we love this interview ❤❤
This  man is a tyrant and murderer. This man paved the way to his companions to steal public fund. This man is enemy for the whole NATION. This man was bitterly rejected by people multiple times. I do not know WHY prominent journalists interview this tyrant???? This man must be in the prison. Shame.
Ranil wickramasinhe one of the fox in sri lanka...😂😂😂😂
Ranil: "I have been in politics before you were born."   Mehdi Hasan: ඉතින් මට නටන්නද කියන්නෙ 😂😂😂 මේ විදිහට මිනිහෙක් නොන්ඩි වෙනවා දෑකලම නෑ🙊 @highlight
Joker Ranil Rajapaksha still trying to be a comedian. Not a funny matter.
Attorney general is rajapassa criminals cronies.., so this joker is part of the inner ring.., we should jail this clown he is a threat to the nation..,
I like this comedy club

This man politics joker
Look eyes. No fear
Thank you for this interview. Al Jazeera is one of the media platform I like. Please do more about the Tamils and Palestinians who still feel oppression.
Mehdi Hasan, should take a interview with Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksha also..
This man politics mental
We didnt invite any one .this is family election. Family members invited .
Ranil is an guardian of the rajapaksas so he save all crime and culprits ranil is a very very corupted person
Well done mehdi hassan.hats off to you .
RW is a great leader ❤❤❤
This clown spent 330m on his foreign travels
Disgraceful and disgusting corrupt idiot 🤮
I proude of Mr වික්‍රමසිංහ ❤❤❤❤❤ I salutes him❤❤
You need to bring the Rajapakshas next
This interview should be shown  in Srilankan TV with subtitles in  Sinhala, so that the Sinhalese  People will come to know about the character of Ranil and how he connived with Rajapaksha family to ruin Srilanka due to threats and fear of death.
Thank you Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe for standing for Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans over this fake news!
😂😂😂😂
We are sri ලංකා ❤❤❤❤❤
I hope that Sri Lanakan Journalists learned something from your team, thanks for exposing him
We were waiting for this moment as young generations of Sri Lankan . Thank you Al-Jazeera!❤
Ohhh man can u wash this chair
19:55 Ranil was schooled 😆
Next time bring මයින්ද මහත්තයා 😂🎉
Actually rajapaksa is who appointed him as president against will of the public so how he take action against rajapaksa noooo
Tamils in the forum sounds very innocent and Frances Harission had no idea of what happened to the majority during 30 year war. Sinhalese people had no answer to their demand of separate state and it was a political issue. Yet LTTE killed hundreds if not thousands of Sinhalese in the rest of the country by suicide bombings and blasting crowded buses. That’s why Sinhalese supported Rajapakse regime to finish LTTE off. Don’t think Sinhalese had any issues with Tamils as such. In 83 riots time I was in Medical hostel attached to Colombo medical faculty and we had the feeling it was orchestrated not by ordinary Sinhalese people. That was a utter disgrace to the ruling elites at the time!
Real Interview superb... 🎉
And people think the Sri Lankan government is serious about justice and accountability lol they can’t even run an economy let alone address the grievances of the Tamils.
He is a disgusting person from out srilankan nation he is involed from all rajapakshas take out
Great stuff Mehdi 🍻
Ranil vikramasiha 1994 from until now 29 u n p time lost
Clown
CIvil War??  it's Separatist war between a terrorist ethnic group and Army.!
As a Sri lankans we respect to that journalist for remove Ranil's clothes in public.
Can you please interrogate the somali president this would interesting
Al Jazeera is trying so hard to help the LTTE terrorists by hiding behind Ranil's corrupt stories and the Ltte friendly people in the audience were telling so much lies. So disgusting. No one talked about the thousands of sinhalese people who were killed by LTTE terrorists. LTTE is the one who committed war crimes.
A real show of "cunning meets the cunning". It would have been the first time for most Sri Lankans seeing Mehdi Hassan. Mehdi has his own agenda and tactics well known to the international arena. I believe he is not a real journalist but a cunning person employing tactics to prove what he wants to be proven. Any unbiased individual who has seen Mehdi's interviews would know his real colors and same goes to Ranil. It seems Ranil was prepared and knew what he had to do. Anyway I guess that the most of the Sri Lankans commenting here are either living off-shores or supporters of the current regime or the LTTE. They are either playing ignorant or has a blind eye to what actually took part during the 2022 protests back in Sri Lanka. Just the idea of Ranil being invited to a talk show with Mehdi in a moment of such global crisis where there are more hot topics proves the point. Taking from channel 4 video which was a decade ago,  coming to the current hipe over Sri Lanka from DW to Mehdi interview now, people should be able to grasp the reality of who's behind the curtains to de-stabilize Sri Lanka. Why are most of the countries in the region destabilized and in political turmoil? Countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan are still in a state of utter failure from a coup or uprising similar to 2022 in Sri Lanka..
Ranil's seventy year political career destroyed less than 1 hour. Need sinhala translation ASAP.
There is enough evidence for the 1983 case. Former president JR Jayawardene (Ranil Wickramasinghe was in his cabinet) purposely allowed it to happen to keep political power.
Respect to this real journalist who has a backbone to question the corrupt 🤜🏼
Didn't see that coming, eh ?
no good ranil
The journalist is told to ask any question, ask about the events of the war and then not ask questions that will hinder national unity. Talking about the war again will hurt the hearts of the Sinhalese and Tamil people. Do you want to drag our country into war again?
2023    THIS  FOX   SIAD    , SURES   SHALY   IS    GOOD  OFFICER     .
😅😅😅
Nice Drama 😅😂 As sri lankans we all know about this person and what he did for this country. If its 10% good things definitely there will be 1110% bad things he did.. This person should also receive the same respect we give to MR. But these 3 individuals (MR+GR+RW) are the culprits who brought our country to its knees. Just check the COPA committee proceedings happening these days—anyone watching will get a clear idea about this person. So, don’t be deceived by this drama Thank you
There is no use interviewing Ranil Wickramasinha. He is an accomplice  of Mahinda Rajapaksha and will tell lies to safeguard Rajapaksha family that  robbed and made Srilanka Bankrupt.
“You are all wrong if you expect Ranil to answer in a way that against Rajapaksa or anyone else. Al Jazeera and other countries have played a role in damaging Sri Lanka. If you truly love Sri Lanka, this is how you should see the situation. This is not just about domestic politics; it is a geopolitical game. If he had spoken carelessly, Sri Lanka would have been targeted by the international community. He was not protecting Rajapaksa, the JVP, or anyone else—he was protecting Sri Lanka. Please try to see the bigger picture instead of viewing things through a narrow political lens.  Whether against Rajapaksa, the LTTE, or the JVP, the country will collapse without support. India is watching all of this closely, and if something happens to Sri Lanka, it will be left with nothing. Europe will never step in to support—not during COVID, not during the economic crisis. Please, educate yourselves. If you truly love Sri Lanka, do not speak against it. He was representing Sri Lanka in that meeting, not the UNP.
I think Mr wicramasinha is correct  why this corresponded  didn't ask frome  un
He’s a murderer. He killed 60, 000 intelligent youth generation in Sri Lanka in 1887, 88 and 89.
To be honest I'm telling..."No More Political Dramas or Cornering" 🙏 We can live peacefully.
Hahaha 😂
Complete propaganda! Stand with Ranil!! RW ♥
Real journalism is here . He got direct talk with evidence . All responsible for destroying our proud nation .
I dont know why they poke their noses in our countries politics....when there are major genocides taking place in the world.....
Idk why these srilankans in comments section supporting the al jazeera propaganda. Don't you know who they are? They are the creators of problems. Use your brains. Ranil w spoke for defend our country. These political slaves of current government don't understand that lol😅
Talk with chamuditha😂
His arrogance is astounding shows how sri lanka was destroyed by him
Thank you Al Jazeera  for this interview, while most people doing nothing about this issue, you made efforts! Please continue your amazing work, Great interviewer!
Bro got humbled
Hats off to the journalist ! Ranil was exposed well and truly. You are a hypocrite Rani. You deserve this well and truly.Let the world know who you are.
A lot to learn for Sri Lankan so called journalist
Aljasira was also in the conspiracy against previous government to destabilise the country .
Most useless priminister in Sri Lanka
Ranil came in full suite and lelt with no clothes
Another nephew of the Uncle Nephew Party (UNP)🙄🤔
AlJazeera interviews one of the most corrupted politicians in sri alanka.
Proud of MR Wickremesinghe.  he face  this interview as a one man show.
I have never seen this man's immaturity and incompetence laid bare for all to see like this
No one asked about what LTT did those daye as a sinhalees we suffr lot i could  not go to school  with my brother  in same bus  my mothe an father  use different  transport  not in same vehicle   . Anyone  know why ?????  If you know you are not asking those question  from ranil wickremesinghe  you are not leaved in sri lanka you are   now all tamil people have better  life than when prabakaran there  The world  must know about ture . if sinhala people went jaffna  they killd us but any tamil people  could go around the country   no insulting  you know why .it is not a war.

Ranil has been always been protected by Rajapaksa regime and in return Rajapaksa ensured Ranil stay in power of opposition party
Granpa is fkin destroyed herewith 🙏🏻🙏🏻 now pls Bring Mahinda Rajapaksa as well plsss 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 - Requesting as a Sri Lankan, a Buddhist, and a Sinhalese if someone questioned
Sri lankan version mr.bean 😂
Conspiracy by extanal power . Proved by Mr, trump leadership
No matter what.I stand with sri lanka 🇱🇰 ❤
සීයා played All the cards but didn't work them at all.. 😂
As a Srilankan , I felt this conversation you guys had with Mr. Been 😁
Paw aneee may ahinsakaya
"Ranna ponil" 👍
Brilliant stuff from Ranil. He basically roasted the host, who was clearly on a confrontational agenda sponsored by Tamil diaspora
A greedy politician who never won the trust of the majority of Sri Lankans except the selfish wise or politically blind Sri Lankans. Thank you Al Jazeera
Not past 70 or 76 years...   ever since this brutal man's uncle came to power in 1977
I feel sad for Sri Lankans. Most of them know some English, but they don’t fully understand it—just like the current president, Anura Kumara. I think former President Ranil did a remarkable job handling the journalist and his questions. However, most Sri Lankans think he got hammered just because the journalist asked a few controversial questions. I feel pity for Sri Lankans, as most of them are fools (sorry, I had to say this). They were fooled by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and now by Anura Kumara, and as always, they suffer
good night grandfather
It should subtitle in Sinhala Majority people
6:02 Ane ranil 😂 blu blu bluuuu......
Habeebi Al Jazeera, Count me as ur subscriber ❤
Thanks AL Jazeera 🎉🎉
i can see him crying from inside for coming to this interview. He literally has tear in eyes after the break 😂
Ranil is an one of brutal digtator in sri lanka
No body accept mental ranil vikramasinha in srilanka
Mehdi is a Shia Takiya Liar
දැන් මොකක්ද ප්‍රශ්නෙ ඇත්ත ප්‍රශ්න ඇහූව ..මෙයා පච උනා ...සාපය එලව එලවා එනව
Thanks for exposing the fraud who deceived the innocent poor with a manipulative tongue and a so-called role as an ''English-speaking'' Prime Minister and also an interim president.
this is the Psycho Killer
Like the way Mr Rajapaksha end the interview. Better mannered and unbiased next time .
This idiot lied to his own people and now lying to International Media..
Thank you aljazeera for exposing the mastermind behind the country's collapse.  The country is better now than during the war. And we will not let the war happen again ever. No matter what the LTTE diaspora is hoping for. The party now in the power of srilanka is the same party who dragged the war to and end. They were the party who iniated the war against LTTE when the tamills closed water supply to sinhala areas in the drought season.
This was much needed!
මහාබැංකුව කඩපු එක ගැනත් ඇහැවනම් තවත් මරු
After all this man done to the country, making fun of Sri Lanka in front of international, this man is history need put him on the past.
Ranil did not commit any crime in 1989. That was Chandrika Bandaranaike’s political propaganda. Because of Ranil’s government, my family and relatives are still alive. How many people did the JVP kill? And how many did the LTTE brutally kill in my entire village? Al Jazeera has no clue—I am a witness to both incidents.
"i love when mahdi switch off him saying"...700 people died, its not funny...."
He has no answer for your questions  Good job sir ❤
Please please broadcast this in sri lanka local channel
THIS GUY MUST BE IN JAIL HE IS A SOCIOPATH PSYCOLOGICAL DISSORDER YOU CAN SEE HIS MOODS CHANGE BY EVERY QUESTION GETTING MORE DEFENSIVE and Interrupting   the journalist....
Mr.ranil wickramasinghe was in opposition  at that war time. How should he be responsible for that? When he appointed as prime minister In 2002 he signed a peace agreement with tamil tigers.
Finally the vails got apart, showed true colours of a Sociopath. Public Shame Shame Shame, Thank you
What an interview,  Mahdi you shaken the iron man, first time I seen Ranil body language gone collapsed
Real culprit ranil
Thank U al Jazeera ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just saw Prof. Maithree, the wife of Ranil in the audience. I really feel bad for her.  RW has been in power multiple times and all what he did was destruction. But he is as cunning as a fox.  He has put down people for not speaking good English but I doubt whether he speaks good English. He made everyone laugh at him.  Respect this journalist.
Ranil ❤
This was brutal, the man willingly walked into the lion’s den.
Unfortunately, this is also all the justice we're going to get
bro shivering and could see huge nervousness in voice. 😅
තරුණ තරුණියන් හැටදහක් මරපු බටලන්දේ වදකයා ලෙස්සිලා යන්න බැහැ මහ බැංකුව හොරා කෑවා රාජපක්ෂලාත් තමුසේත් අපේ රට බංකොලොත් කරා. රටට තමුන් සාපයක්
To make it clear this is the person that Mehdi asked to "rate" president Ranil claimed that Sri Lanka committed genocide in her first sentence & Note that this woman representing a far right organisation that  supports seperatism in Sri Lanka just like the LTTE terrorists. TBH president Ranil should have been more clear. But I cant help but to observe the cheap click bait nature of the show. He not just prevented the full answers by the President but also allow a pro ethno facist spokeswoman & her gang to make unsubstantiated claims uninterupted.
This so-called 'elite class,' who believe they can cheat people, has been rejected by Sri Lankan youth and no longer holds any value or credibility. Revolution isn’t just about changing the system; it’s about changing the people.
Real Mr.Bean Character. We are happy, we have brilliant joker...
These politicians had th power to develop th country. All they played was th game of power hunger, protecting th corrupt elite rajapakshas nd big time feeding thr own pockets.
Simply what you did was protect all the corrupt politicians who caused the economy to collapse and handed the wreckage over to the IMF to fix. Meanwhile, those same politicians continued their actions as before, enjoying their lives as they wished. The real burden, however, fell on the general public, facing rising prices, hunger, malnutrition, and deaths due to starvation. You may think that you’ve done something for the country, but in reality, you’ve done nothing except oppress and bring injustice with your hypocritical mindset. You only care about power and have no kindness or sympathy for the people. You’ve been mocking the parliament, thinking you’ll always remain in power. If you had acted sincerely, you wouldn’t be humiliated in front of the international community. Instead, they would have praised your actions. Always remember, oppression and injustice never leave you, no matter where you go. You can’t fool everyone forever. Now, you’re starting to see the fruits of the seeds you’ve sown. You might have thought you would never be caught, but the cries of the oppressed will never leave you.
Brilliant journalist... Finally Ranil met a real journalist❤❤❤
respect al jazeera
POV: Ranil being pathetic for 49 minutes straight
This fool thinks he can win an audience by throwing some childish arguments.
Thank you Mr. Hasan.
This interview is with Those who LTTE Tamils who fled to UK and the Ranil Wickramasinghe 😅😅 Where is Rajapaksha for this Interview.. Those who have no idea abt SL politics commenting like big socia bodies 😅
Get caught today😅
😂😂 Fool ranil
Ranil is an idiot! This Fakka should be in jail.  What a clown 🤡
what about the people killed by LTTE  .. NOBODY GIVE VALUE FOR THOSE LIVES. IS NOT IT DOUBLE  STANDARD?
He is wandering around unable to answer.
Looks like still playing American agendas behind aljasira
Such a swollen headed stupid man … always double game his nature … being Gay married to a lesbian woman and appointed his gay partner one of his advisor … wasting public money for his well being and even he doesn’t know how to behave on panel of discussion or TV interview… disgusting ..
Dear Mr. Hassan, you are talking to one of the most evils who ordered the killings of around 60,000 innocent young men and women assumed to be of rival political parties in the name of terrorists during 1988 and 1991. He knew he was not killing the terrorists. In his last years as president, he spent millions of dollars on his visits overseas that he hardly had any national interests in one year period when some poor people had only the skeleton covered by skin with the only life-sign of heart beat while lying on road-side. He is being spat into the worm infested garbage bin by most Sri Lankans in their memories when he comes to their mind. He is not worth being spoken about.
Thank you all,  for your support 🙏🙏🙏
ranis is the only president really love his people and country .. ranil never surrendered to external pressure. ranil never bow down to international corrupted politicians
Ranil destroyed my country and killed so many people.  He joined with corrupted Rajapakse.  He is is so corrupted
Wow .. respect Mehdi… ❤ thank you
His -intelligent- educated  dumbass got handed back to him lmaooooo
Getting fu.....d internationally 😅😅
Thank you Al Jazeera for exposing these corrupt politicians.
Well done journalists.  He knows what he's talking about.
he didnot know english, only singhale
Thanks Aljazeera
It was a English class to me 🎉
Ranil is a murder ..🖕🖕 ....from 🇱🇰
Many peoples had been kill.he making fun of it.such a cruel man.
Real life முதல்வன் சீன் 😂
Thank you for this interview. This is a murderer who has killed the biggest number of brave youngsters in Sri Lanka, who wanted to change the system. We call this man the tormentor of Batalanda!
Sri Lankan please put your comment here, share this as much as possible
Pre meditated questions. LTTE panel of experts. Rigged audience. The central topic of the interview was the alleged war crimes and the hate against Rajapaksas for putting an end to the 30 year war in Sri Lanka. Everything else was icing on the cake. Hats of RW! It takes expertise, experience, composure to go against all odds.

Wooow big Thank for AlJasira from Sri Lanka.❤❤ poor Ranil😂
Mr mehadi can you bring up nethanyahu on this seat who killed almost 100000 innocent women and  children within one year.  and question him like this then I will say mehadi is real journalist
(21 To 22.5 )This OLD GUY HAND’S shaking and His body language tells the whole story.
@slhistory he has a lot of knowledge on our history, he schools many Sri Lankans, plus 49 minutes of the footage is cut. There is no way Ranil didn’t talk about LTTE and ask Pearl action what about LTTE etc. The whole documentary seems like propaganda to portray Sri Lanka as anti Tamil and even Ranil as a racist, when there is plenty of evidence he is not. He literally fired the archeological department to because of the land grab issue reminding them Tamil Buddhist did exist. Howcome he said none of this, something is fishy here..
The top murderer in SL politics 🧨
Ranil is a nasty Rat. He know how to manipulate.
You know I do have certain concerns about Al Jazeera wanting to do this interview. One being why is a double sided media form doing this interview and Two is that why was Ranil Wickremasinghe not even given the proper chance to an answer. Sure we would know when he would fib as we know his tactics especially concerning to the facts about his own human rights violation.
Mehdi should be given the Sri Lankan citizenship..❤
STANDING WITH RANIL 🇱🇰💪🏻
ජෙප්පෙක් නේද ප්‍රශ්ණ අහන්නේ
Wal balla batanada gathakya tho
Al Jazeera, Thanks for bringing this murderous former President of SL Infront of a world community forum for the first time. I would appreciate if this interview is produced in Sinhala and telecast in SL TV as there is still some part of the SL population who still thinks that he should be a president. However majority of Sri Lankans don't give any respect to him.
Lmao. The first time this "seasoned statesman" has met an actual journalist, who doesn't serve up soft balls like back home. When you're only surrounded by lapdogs and leeches, with no real friends to call your BS out to your face, this is a result. Thank you Mehdi for doing what few, if any journos, will do back home.
I give Credit to the Ranil, no need any one to involve our country problems, we have good experience in past time for that , who ever out side people can't figure out our problems. any way Mahinda done to the country major clearance his time, I never  forget him, I jump from the running train few times when i was going to my working place in the war period of time, because LTTE set up the remote control bombs on the train. still I have that feeling, not only me pregnant women even ,, still no one can't  defeat him because of that, but other people use Mahinda for their  favorite, that how ministers depend always.
Ranil wickramasinghe one of the dangerous person in srilanka he knows how to playing his cards very carefully
I am Muslim but I will say ranil is not a brand for only srilanka he is a international brand and walking library
And now we have the Greatest President With all the Files with evidence of corruption around country so far, yet no any actions to be seen.
The prince of Batalanda....😢
Separatist group? You mean the terrorists.
Literally Rani has no brain 🤡
"Let it be clear: Tamil people and the Tamil Tigers are not the same. The crimes and atrocities committed by the Tamil Tigers were brutal and unmatched, even by today’s terrorist groups. Sri Lanka was ravaged by the Tigers, with innocent lives lost to bombings and violence with a 30 year war. I still remember how, in the final stages of the war, they mercilessly killed their own people. Prabhakaran was nothing more than a terrorist.  Both innocent Sinhalese and Tamil lives were lost, but to defend the Tigers — terrorists hiding behind innocent civilians — is nothing short of hypocrisy."
He's a Claun when he was a president. But accusations regards to war criminals,  why not talking about child soldiers and invented suicide bombing By LTTE. This should end now. Both sides ended up losing valuable human life's.  A nother Talk show end of the day. Just talk show itself. Those who attended to show,I hope they got good paycheck at the end of the show 😂😂😂
This is absolute cinema!
karma is true....
Ranil, you will never go for an Al Jazeera Head to Head program. You tried to put out your Gon Jokes, but you failed because the audience was educated. Not like our parliament members. You were proven to be a liar in the Head to Head program. 1) You said that almost the entire parliament including SJB members voted for you to be the appointed president. But you know jolly well that only 134 parliamentarians from the Rajapaksa SLPP party voted for you to be the president. 2) Regarding the Batalanda killings and disappearances. You asked the interviewer to show the report. We thank the member of the panel (former BBC correspondent for Sri Lanka) who showed the Batalanda report to the audience. 3) You will never sue the Rajapaksas or members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, because they are the ones who made you the president. 4) The whole country knows that the 1983 riots were created by J.R. and Premadasa. Ranil, you went to burn the library in Jaffna, along with Gamini Dissanayake and two others. We have read and studied all these facts. Wait until you have to pay for all these sins.
Sri Lanka central bank robbery man ranil Wickremesinhe hi is our country 40 years experience Parliament members he is best our Sri Lankan property saler and thieves are protecter not have he has only very bad to our country no development hi is only talk
Most corrupted politician in the sri lanka
Calmer questioning would have resulted in complete answers
In a battle of egos, the loser wins. What’s super sad is that Sri Lanka, like many nations around the world, is still stuck on the idea of a leadership that must be male, geriatric, patriarchal, colonial (can’t imagine a woman president with zero political influence). This model reflects the predominant culture (conservative and casteist) and mentality (revering and enabling bad elders, prioritizing male ambition, pedestalizing deep-pocketed sons) that is further influenced by the archaic Buddhist religious institution (can’t possibly imagine what Siddhartha would do) and Sinhala majority complex, which are the primary obstacles (that make up Sinhala Buddhist supremacy/privilege) to the progress of the land and all of its people. Where there is a lack of embrace of diversity in all its forms, the poverty and scarcity mindset governs practice. Where there is a lack of ethics, irreverence to pathways for justice is normalized. Where there is a lack of imagination, ideas of inclusivity die. Where there is a lack of healing, the wounded-child-in-an-adult-body rules. So as long as these blindspots are ignored or unacknowledged by a people, they will attract/appoint/receive the leader that they deserve.
Ranil has a degree related to Corruption and Criminology. 😂😂😂
Ranil the joker 🤣
He's one of the  main guy behind this crisis
21:35 RW lost his underpants 😂😂
This is very biased!
Ranil is a embarrassment to Sri lanka
This bastard's uncle, J.R. Jayewardene, and the thugs of the United National Party that ruled the country at that time, burned and destroyed the Jaffna Library in 1982. Ranil Wickremesinghe was a minister at the time and it was he who gave the instructions to burn the library.
Omg can someone who have seen Mehdi before explain poor Sri Lankans what's going on here ?
Rajapaksha and Ranil both of them same person 😂 Both of them destroyed srilanka.
The best word that I heard was "It's not funny that several people have died" Hat off from Sri Lanka. No one in Sri Lankan political presenter said that even 🔥❤️
Thank you Al Jasira!!!
Whole Sri Lanka know that he is the culprit behind the batalanda torching camp . Where innocent campus student have been detained torched and killed .
There was NO ANY CIVIL WAR. It was a war against LTTE which was a group of terrorists.
Trust me he is not a buddhist, he is the most corrupted politician in Sri Lanka!
As Youth Minister, involved in the killing of thousands of youth. As Industrial Minister, shut down many industries. As Finance Minister, robbed the central bank. The ultimate failed character.
As a Sri Lankan citizen, I am embarrassed that my country was led by this clown (on more than one occasion). Until there is intra-party democracy within the main political parties in Sri Lanka, unfortunately the calibre of clowns 🤡 we get will be no better.
Is this a comedy show😂😂😂😂entha moana Ranil center fresh sapadanga😂😂😂😂
Whole Sri Lanka know that he is the culprit behind the batalanda torching camp . Where innocent campus student have been detained torched and killed .
Thank you Al Jazeera.He is the killer. He is responsible for the deaths of 60,000 young people. He burnt down the Jaffna library. That was the one of the reason for the thirty-year Sinhala-Tamil war. He bankrupted the country by misusing the Central Bank's money. He allowed his gang to do all the corruption to maintain his power.
Cooked by m hasan❤
At the beginning he is the fighter. After couple of questions, he is the flighter.
Thank you, Mr. Wickramasingha, for your leadership and dedication to Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Army has played a crucial role in maintaining stability, and their sacrifices deserve the utmost respect. A special appreciation to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his decisive leadership in bringing an end to terrorism and restoring peace to the nation. His efforts in safeguarding the country’s future will always be remembered
Journalist trying to harass and corner him without giving proper time to answer him. Further, journalist is beating around the bush.
බටලන්ද වදකාගාරයේ පරම්පරාක්ම මරලා පුච්චලා දැම්මා😡😡
Next guest should be Netanyahu
Ranil wikramasingha is fox😡
If you ask a question and don’t give him a chance to answer thinking you’re far ahead of him it shows your indecency as a reporter
Old fox
This man who created civil war in SL by burning the jaffna library and also 83 riots. This man with rajapakse share the power in sri lanka for decades and let the poor to be poor and they enjoyed.  Well NPP in power in sri lanka now and the law and order is in placed. Justise will be Served
Daim. I like mahdiii
A conversation with a low-level journalist who does not know any media ethics. RW is the leader who saved sri lanka from the economic crisis. And he is the leader who split the ltte terrorists. As a sri lankan, I'll always give him that respect.. Thank you sir! And shame on al jazeera, which is dependent on the money of the tamil ltte diaspora
Instead of firing questions like this why don't you go and interview the Israeli prime minister on the war crimes millions of people who have lost their lives ..homes...children who have been maimed...lost their child hood...the orphans...those who are starving because of the wars and everyone thinks they are justified....!
Nice job congratulations
Well done RW , excellent interview
Ranil's performance is a shame and disgrace to Sri Lankans
Excellent interrogation by a real journalist.
First...its relaxing to see that a very smart journalist mehdi interviewing sir.ranil wikramasinghe....literally making much sense. ..second..i have to be respectful here so that am laughing alonee...without expressing with any emojis.
Ranil was Roasted 🍗
al jazeera disgusting
Hats off to Al jazeera media team. ❤️ From Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 he is the biggest thief and robber in our country. Shame on Ranil . We have good trust about our npp government.😊
19:20
🫡🫡🫡 Salute for This Journalist. And Al Jaziii❤
Fox tried to play the same game he palyed with srilankans. But now those tricks are old. So those were not enough LOL
Thank you Aljazeera taking off the clothes of Mr. Ranil Rajapaksha who is mainly repsponsible of bankruptcy in Sri Lanka ! Respect the way the presenter asked the questionans. This former president should be prosecuted and serve rest of his time in Jail
London & UK, please carryout an investigation on genocides you did in many number of countries, trillions of treasures  stolen from. Mostly still remains in your museums. Its not hard to return them, even now. Then only come and accuse others
like Mudalwan movie interview 😆
😡😡😡 He is shouting proudly " i was in the opposition , so the government had to caught me if i wrong "  But the reality was , when the rajapaksas were on power, they save ranil from the law and currupt as they wish, As well as when ranil was on power, he save rajapaksas from the law, they had a big deal on backstage, and that was the strategy they followed up.  the point which came out that deal continues for years , were 2022 ranil appointed as the president by rajapaksas votes,   They had to act that drama infront of people , and people recognized that clearly and given them the best answer in the election.
Great journalist.
6:38 i have been in polirics even before you were born.  some might say that's part of the problem!   Golden!!!!! 😂😂😂
War itself is a crime...
Wow nice interview with reals journalist
Ask Bond scam... His friend looted bank of Ceylon.looooooser
Ranil Rajapalshe 😂
නිශ්ශබ්ද වෙන්න..........😂
Ranil is a monster than has so much blood on his hands and he lives in a mansion in Sri Lanka and he has the guts to talk about "not having money". He deserves to be in jail with all of the Rajapakshe's.
Thank you for doing this I like ❤ Al Jazeera
Looiooser
Respect this journalist ❤
I dont agree with AJ. but this is top-notch 👌 🎉
35:30 Where is the report?  Here it is!!!!!.... you.. you... you.. you.... err err..., karama is always comming after you murderer !!!
Interviewer is a simpleton. No respect for the job he is doing.
කජු ආතා, just got served! 🤣
Terrible journalism. No discipline at all.
Al-Jazeera mind ur own  business shall we talk about the current war in gaza 😂 talking about justice and democracy while theres a war zone going on
Aljazeera ❤❤
F*cking former president Ranil Rajapaksha. This idiot gambling with SL people
I think this journalist leaned a good lesson from this gentleman, that great leaders never betrayed their countries no matter how much enemies trying to disrespect you.. Great example of leadership ❤ Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

Everyone is questioning about war crimes done by the forces but nobody is talking about war crimes done by the LTTE terrorists. Nobody has a backbone to call the LTTE terrorists but calling them separatists or some sweet names. LMAO
I sincerely apologize to the Tamil community as a Sri Lankan. Please don’t misunderstand the Sinhala people by judging them based on Ranil’s reckless behavior. This is not about him acting like a madman it’s about certain biased Sinhala individuals influencing this situation. I urge you not to form a wrong impression about the entire Sinhala community because of this.
He is nothing..for Sri Lanka.looser
Mr Ranil should have asked that young lady how old was she when the Mulliwakkal case happened? She must have been a little girl at that time. If so how could she remember something difficult to keep in mind even to elders.
Tahank you Aljazeera ❤❤
murderer of Batalanda🤮
These tamils think that this is their country. What a joke of a nation.
This guy robbed the central bank, you found a great person to ask about Sri Lanka 😂
This man played a big role in srilanka behind the war crimes& economincal issues.. in our coutry. A big thief..  wel done aljazeera🔥🔥🔥
If he has power.he is not talking like this.remember in Germany .how he respond to him why don't you ask Bond scam.he robbed Bank of  Ceylon
Ranil, Mahinda, and Chandrika, all three presidents was responsible for mis handling the executive position and the dire situation where we are now
You should have asked about ranil's head of the central bank and head of the police instead of very old stuff.
Ain’t no human put this much of pressure on any Sri Lankan politician like mehdi did ❤️🙏🏽
හයියෝ රෙදිහෝදල හෝදල සබන් බාල්දිය ඔලුවෙ ඉදන් හලාගත්ත 🤦‍♂
I am Tamil Australian ; Ex President / PM Ranil is a credible politician than many other Racist Sinhala politicians ; he handled this interview very well ;
Why no answer the question raised regarding why LTTE didn't agree for the peace when RW invited them to come for the peace agreement when he was the PM in 2002 to 2004?
Well done Al -Jazeera!! 💪✨️🎊️
At last a genuine interview… At least RW is a person who could understand the questions, unlike those SLPP Baiyos
Culprit
But at least let the man speak. Don't interrupt him while he is trying to clarify something!
Sri lanka is heading to a one party politics.. no democracy anymore.. just like China.. people will realise sooner and the consequences for defeating this gentleman.. He is the last recognised democratic symbol of Sri Lanka..🇱🇰
It is now quite apparent that international politics and media are pushing for another war in Sri Lanka. If their intentions were honest, why was the interview so polarized towards one extreme? Why wasn't a balanced view presented to the viewers? Isn't that part of the problem? You expect justice when your interview itself sets an bad example of not serving justice to a balanced view.
Ranil could have given a history lesson to the world on our conflict, British divide and rule really truly explain it from both sides and expose the Tamil Eelam lobby like Pearl. Ranil failed immensely. Al Jazeera could have shown to the world how Sri Lanka government is authoritharian mentioning 60,000 majority Sinhalese died and truly contrast with the war against LTTE. Instead it did not it focused more on LTTE and Mullivaikal, to portray Sri Lanka as anti Tamil! It like Ranil was not prepared for this interview at all! Disappointing! This is the same Ranil who divided the LTTE peacefully, explain to the Sri Lanka archeological department of the history of the Tamil Buddhists! It seem there is a lot more to this video, Ranil is very clever, he knows our history well. 49 minutes of the video was cut out. What did Aljazeera cut out and why??
His only card of playing with a journalist is 'JOKER'. In Sri Lanka he would crack a joke as an answer for a question from a journalist. Then all laugh together along with journalists. But this time Ranil has met a real journalist. "IS EVERYTHING A GAME TO YOU?" That's spot on. The answer is YES.  EDIT - Tamils those who support terrorists may claim the war is 'genocide' But for SRI LANKANS it is freedom from tamil terrorists.
Very true that Mullivai people's tragedy . But why this journalist is not talking about How small school children were bombed by LTTE in Kurunagala and killed due to taking revenge.  How come one side will be innocent and other one will be accused?
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a murderer. And during his time in government, he did everything he could to kill the evidence.
Very true that Mullivai people's tragedy . But why this journalist is not talking about How small school children were bombed by LTTE in Kurunagala and killed due to taking revenge.  How come one side will be innocent and other one will be accused?
Ranil Wickremasinghe is among the founding politicians of Sri Lanka’s state terrorism and social destruction since 1977. He spoke on mobs but when in earlier times they connected politics with underworld criminals. Famous that they fed them in their backyards but some are never seems to realize it
Thank  you very much former president  &  Al Jazeera  English  -Qatar  and other participants members
We dont want this kind of bady p p
Batalanda demon killed so many young lives in 1988,89. Corrupted man.should be in jail long times ago.all those years he done political games only.destroyed whole country with rajapaksha regiment.
Funny how some sri lankan people still thinks this clown is some kind of political genius
Bro why don't you give him time to answer questions. And why don't you'll talk about the good things done by the army like not attacking LTTE with large weapons beacause innocent tamils get affected. And war is war. They started it
The truth is, Sri Lanka is a country with a racist majority, on all ethnicities. If you think there will be accountability force under democracy in Sri Lanka, you are mistaken. To be fair to Ranil, even under immense pressure and while being branded as a traitor, he did push to charge some for war crimes. You are barking up the wrong tree there.  As for him being a part of the corrupt political elite, yes obviously. This guy should be accountable for many things, corruption under his watch, negligence during easter attacks etc.. but on racial harmony and recncilliation, he was on the right direction
War is a racket to loot public's present/future (because of loan) money. At the end of war  few became super rich, intellectual left the nation, working class left the nation, deep scar in people's mind. Post independence Peace was there with happiness, Peace was destroyed, war destroyed physically now peace is there without happiness ... Greed, hate, anger destroyed happiness... All those  who died in the wars could not take the land with them for which they fought for and neither the people who are living coul do the same.. Then what for the war occurred ... to destroy happiness
Bady guy in sri lanka
පිස්සු පකයෙක් මූ. 😂 bring him behind the bars.
I am Sri Lankan. Great service  - Al Jazeera . RW has  met real journalist. ❤🎉
Economic murderers in sri lanka. Thanks journalist....
This guy is a national embarrassment
පිස්සු පකයෙක් මූ. 😂
please call basil rajapaksha Aljazeera
Thank you Al Jazeera ❤ this is a person who maintained personal torture chambers.
Stay home 👌 RW
This program was funded by LTTE terrorists remaining overseas.. Shame on you, Al Jazeera, for your cheap thrills..
This was the truth behind Ranil Wicramasinghe presidency.  Ranil was by passed 'care taker government' which should implement after uprising Aragalaya 2022 blessings of Mahinda, Gotta and Basil who were running away from the country.  රනිල් බයිලා ගහන්නේ පොරක් වෙන්න. 2022 අරගලය නිසා පාර්ලිමේන්තු නියෝජනය කරන පක්ෂ වලින් සමන්විත භාරකාර ආණ්ඩුවක් හැදීමට සියල්ල සූදානම් කර තිබියදී මහින්ද ගොඨා හා බැසිල්ගේ ඉල්ලීම මත රනිල් ජනාධිපති භාර ගත්තා. දන්නො දනිති !
This dam interview is fricking manipulative man.people who are not from this country no nothing.9/11 happend Bush invadaes a freaking country and we can't defend are own country without being violated for human rights. Thank god Trump's here or other wise we would've vanished off the face of the planet
What a childish way to act upon the civil war question!!
6:15 They were not peaceful protesters 6:41 No one says that. 8:59 The election cost a few billion, but air tickest doenst. 10:05 If Rajapasa committed any crimes, this new government could have brought them to court. (Nothing happened for 6 months.) 11:30 What's wrong with that?
He's a fu%&ing torturer, murderer and a symbol of Sri Lankan corrupted politics. Hats off  Mehdi.❤
I am in Sri Lanka. Mr. Ranil Wikramasinha is dangerous killer. He hide all evidence. And protects Rjapaksha family.  I am respect media anchor. And respect Al 🤝🤝🤝
you are interviewing one of person who  did the crisis. all are same
Im glad dis old crook was exposed by Al Jazeera
Now all people know why he was not elected as a president in Sri Lanka by wise Sri Lankan people. Respect the channel
going   so low is not even Al jazeera should do. its not professional journalism but plan thuggery by the interviewer. why not tell usaid funded for what?
Which type of foolish questions ?
AL jazeera thank you for letting this happen.....they need to fear to people.... As sri lankans thanks again please help our country.... In here there are good people..... AL jazeera ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really like Mahdi Hasan, the host of this show. I love watching all of his interviews.  I am from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 🫰✨
Mr bean. ❤❤ Love u
The ideal set of questions to invent old-new problems and distort any reconciliation 🙂
For almost fifty years in parliament, the country was   is a person who has been destroyed
Oh poor Ranil 😂
People laugh at Rw not the journalist.!!
Pearl action. Disappointing, Ranil could have expose their bias on national television. Ranil failed. He could have explain why 2 countries in a tiny island will not work and economically would ruin us, he failed. He could have explain Sri Lanka history to the world, how we was 1 kingdom and we have shared history with Tamils, he failed that to. He couldn’t explain to the audience about LTTE wrongs that led to mass civilians casualties in 2009. He failed again. It also seems Aljazeera has been very bias towards pro LTTE supporters etc except sir Deva. The language used about JVP seems to whitewash what happens to the Sinhalese. 60,000 were killed in 2 years, Al Jazeera could have shown the world how authoritarian Sri Lanka government is no matter the ethnicity. Instead it strongly portrayed Sri Lanka as anti Tamil. Sri Lankans should unite and protest and ask Al Jazeera to release the remaining 49 minutes. This is very bias reporting. How can Sri Lanka allow a new channel to cause ethnic division like this without and repercussion. This documentary is proof Al Jazeera is somehow getting funds from pro Tamil Eelam lobby. Will Sri Lanka investigate this.   The first part went well, exposing Sri Lanka”s politicians as working together, Ranil seem to be Ranil Rajapaksa, plus the government denial to really investigate the Easter attack. However the end tried to portray Sri Lanka as anti Tamil. ALJAZEERA where is THE REST OF THE VIDEO! WHY ARE YOU CAUSING ETHNIC DIVIDE?
Mehdi, you be better mannered," says the guy who lost it within the first five minutes.
Bro never travel to UK again 🤣🤣😂
Weldone Mr. President, thank you very much for defending our country against tamil elam terrorists.  The present government fooled the people with the help of the LTTE diaspora.  People will realise sooner or later.. Until then, thank you, former president Mr. RANIL WICKRAMASINGHE for everything you have done to save our mother land.. ❤🇱🇰 ❤
👌
This is too good! Thank you!
Koheda yanney malley pol 😂

Fully agreeing with how the first part of the interview went, where he defended the Rajapaksas, the latter part felt more like an attempt to pressure Sri Lanka on war crimes which was something the Tamil diaspora has long wanted a Sri Lankan president to acknowledge. He handled it fairly well, never conceding to their narrative. RW was essentially bullied by Western media, which was intent on finding a scapegoat for so-called war crimes.
If this interview is going on a Sri Lankan channel it’ll be a total plot, Real corruptions and human rights violations will always be a joke to Ranil Rajapaksha.hat’s off to the journalists
Respect you Ranil for accepting palastin as separate state ❤
Im a srilankan.. A BIG SALUTE TO MR. MEHDI... HE IS A TRAITOR. PLEASE CONDUCT A RESEARCH ABOUT ""BATALANDA PRISON"".. YOU WILL GET TO KNOW RANIL'S TRUE FACE.
Watching from Canada. Love for the home country never dies 🇱🇰❤️
There was not civil war in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan military fight against the terrorist.
Shame on RW behavior of lie and arrogance
මහින්ද යුද්දේ ඉවර කිරිම අපි හැමෝම සතටු වෙන්න ඕන
This interview clearly depicts how my poor country was destroyed by cunning politicians.
Better get Tony Blair and ask about  Iraq and what they did to them ????
The biggest mistake in his life sitting in front of mahdi 😂
Repeat Al-Jazira ❤
යුද්දේ ගැන කියලා මේ මනුසයව අමාරුවේ දැමීම වැරදියි. එකට අපි උඩ ගෙඩි දෙන එකත් වැරදියි

group of tamil Terrorist
He took on responsibility when nobody else chose the same . The true problem to the country of Sri Lankan is the history of the country. We need to understand what the British (Divide and Rule) and the West did to the country over the last 75 years. It’s deep rooted.   The most happy and warm people in this side of the world!!   The people of this country are the most talented !!
Mehdi Hasan thanks for exposing this head of corruption guy My Brother ❤️
Why he is not letting answer, because not letting Ranil to deviate track.
Ranil this is not the President's meadia.  No filters in here 😂😂.  So now you are nacked .
Feels like RW attending this interview is kinda RW's some agenda
Tamil Eleam❤❤❤💥💥💥💥
Our local media cannot roast him like this .🎉
The Envoy gave the answer in a brief and most relevant manner that "the question is not what Mr.Wickramasinghe can or can not do... it is the lousy system of Justice". So true. Now people believe that there are no conflicts of interest for the legal system of Sri Lanka. They believe the Court is independent so, it's time for this new government to proceed with all these allegations and bring and ensure justice for all victims. Personally, I believe that they're also experiencing that inability to do it in this awful system.
The guy said “I get high on power” My people got him on “rehabilitation” 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
Most arrogant leader, one who failed Sri Lanka!!
Let’s not forget , the civil war was also engineered mainly by his uncle and other relatives and he was even a minister during black July who gave dismissive comments for the plight of the Tamil people from the VERY beginning . Who fanned  racism and who at every point used the divisiveness of Sri Lankans to his own political gain. For the comments check news articles from that time , specially the day after black July . 46:09  But here he is trying spin things around , even trying to paint the ONE person who created black July in to a saint . REFUGE CAMPS 😂 . Who made them refuges in the first place ? In their own country ?
සීයාට කෙදිරි ගෑවෙන්නම ඩුන්නා 😂. හොද වැඩේ besikayata තරුණ පරම්පරාවක් මරපු ඝාතකයට 😅
Thank you for inviting a person who is responsible for corruption of sri Lanka for a long time. 😂
This idiot stated Mahinda is a war criminal. What do we have to say about that guys 😂😂😂
Mahdi is similar to chamuditha not letting RW to continue his thoughts
Joker from srilanka.
Response is more like childish as mentioned by Mehdi.   But the information that has been questioned by Mehdi to Ranil sounds horrific and monstrous.   How can one deny when evidence is thrown at tour face and still you cant accept it. The body language tells it out.
The attendants laugh at RW. Sad to see RW thinks theyre laughing at the interviewer
All Sri Lankans call him as "බටලන්ද මූර්ගයා" Devil of Batalanda...
This is very needed interview , which open eyes of idiotic sri lankans. Watch COPE inspection going on in sri lanka its in you tube   and what he has done.
Ranil doing just joke noting to get from him, he just like a joker..😅
He is mr. Been😂😂😂😂
Thanks to aljazeera ask good question to ranil Rajapaksa
Thanks to aljazeera ask good question to ranil Rajapaksa
Joker of srilanka, well done Al Jazzera
Thanks to aljazeera ask good question to ranil Rajapaksa
It's very clear that this Journalist is not allowing him to answer for the questions when this journalist understands that he will be cornered by the RW's answer.  NO DEMOCRACY EVEN IN THIS INTERVIEW 😂
Pakkaya Ranil Rajapaksa
Ranil  high time you take rest from politics. 🙏🙏🙏
Mehdi Hasan... You're a unique personality. Well talented journalist. Hats off 🎉
Wonder what they told him the interview was going to be about..
Thanks to aljazeera ask good question to ranil Rajapaksa
It's disgusting to see some sri lankans replying here ...i am very much against ranil wikramasinghes politics and ideologies. I absolutely hate him but I don't wash my dirty linnen in public . And this so called journalist is like there version of chamuditha
Thanks to aljazeera ask good question to ranil Rajapaksa
It does not mean that deploying so called experts and making them to accuse and comment on RW to prove that RW is wrong.  For each and every questions RW is answering clearly.  That's called his experience
Nothing could be more straightforward and BLUNT in the questions asked by Mehdi. I mean straight answers couldn't be given it was more like dodging the questions. This is more like an embarrassment.
This stupid Ranil doesn’t know the courtesy.
Thank you Al Jazeera for doing an excellent job of holding this incompetent official accountable as he bears a significant share of responsibility for much of what has transpired in Sri Lanka. He can't just brush off the allegations against him by asking whether the reports were tabled. The truth is, he's the very reason they weren’t. Good job Al Jazeera!!!
What started as a fair discussion about Sri Lanka's economic crisis and the accountability of its former president slowly turned into a platform for the Tamil diaspora's favored narrative. It's interesting how Mehdi didn't once address the suffering endured by the majority Sinhalese during the war and the economic collapse. The suicide bombings, which primarily targeted school children, monks, and innocent civilians in the South, were horrific. Who were the true victims of the conflict? His questions seemed heavily biased and presumptuous. And the claim about bombing hospitals? That’s utterly absurd. I doubt Mehdi would approach former global leaders like Obama or Bush with the same tone. It almost feels as though the Tamil diaspora influenced the entire event, using it to vent their frustrations on Ranil. (To be clear, I’m not defending Ranil or the Rajapaksas.)
What happened in srilanka is tamil gurilla tigers 🐅 started war asking a part of the island  and we all know Tamils belongs to india not to Srilanka these Tigers used thier own kids to go to war o worked for war victims the suicide bombers killed many srilankan kids so  just lets not talk about Tamil Tigers and war crime prbakaran is responsible for Tamil people no Ranil
Ranil LGBT member.
This man is the master mind behind most crimes over last 40 years alone with his Uncle Jayawardene
Journalist roasted ranil 🤣
Madura Rasaratnam you beauty. To the point on fire 🙌
Ranil Wickramasinghe says that, from his two-hour discussion, Aljazeera has edited only what he needs.  ?  As I saw in the video, they want to use the facts of the war in the north of Sri Lanka to demand justice for Palestine.  According to Ranil Q, Palestine is a separate independent administrative region, but the north of Sri Lanka is not such an independent administrative region.
Very good journalism.❤❤❤❤
It's turning to Younus 🩷🇧🇩
Thank you Al Jazeera!!!!
Al jazeera your media is 🤡 as 💩 i bet you can't bring Mr.putin or Netanyahu to your interview. Day by day in Gaza so many people dies you guy's do nothing 😃 shame on you!

Ranil Rajapaksha telling the lies.He is steelar of Central bank.
This is just propaganda for the LTTE 😂😂😂 Stupid Sri Lankans don’t get this 💩💩💩
As A Sri Lankan, I must say that RW is pure evil. You wouldn’t be able to imagine what he has done. I must respect this journalist to not get away this man with his sarcastic comments. That journalist must be given a promotion!
All these ethics issues were started by the manipulators branch of great England! Unfortunately , all ethnicities suffered due to that!
If this were an interviewer in Sri Lanka, he would disappear or die."
What happened to this journalist ?
SO CALLED veteran politician in Sri lanka,  one of the major person who is responsible  to the societal collapse of the country. He has never been interviewed in such a way before.Kudos to the interviewer👏
crazy one
World should know that ousted President Gotabhaya Rajapkse was denied to fly to Maldives by DGCA by signing the approval document,  soon after this idiot took over , the DGCA Cpt Themiya (then DGCA) was fired from the position.  That's how he took the revenge from responsible officials of SriLanka.
Great leader Ranil ❤❤❤❤❤❤
No one asked about the child soldiers
I'm not Sri Lankan but after watching this interview but I can say that he wasn't prepared to face these questions from Mehdi.
Srilankan Serial killer..
It’s just noise from Al Jazeera—no real facts. He’s talking nonsense. Hats off to Ranil; his stance is clear, despite being up against LTTE-aligned groups.
Just look at the comment bar. You all will understand how much true Sri Lankans reject this murder. He and his team stole our lives, our happiness and everything. If you wanna understand the truth, just look how he struggled..
This man is one of the main culprits for the downfall of Sri Lankan economy along with the Rajapaksha regime 🥴 yes he has done something for the country when he was a young minister in 80’s.. nothing after that!
Great leader Ranil Wickramasinghe  and immature journalist..
He had a lot of innocent youth killed from 1987 to 1989 in Batalanda Torture Chambers!!!!!!!
Best interview 👏🏽
The thing is Brian of the people,
Thanks to aljazeera for your head to head with Ranil wickramasinghe.. next time, we will hope to see you soon with mahinda rajapaksa.
Mahdi don't waste your time  Talking to a Most disgraceful politician in sri lanka this guy is the Fail leader of sri lanka  What did he did for the Sri Labkans for the past 50 years in the politics  Despite corruptions . He is a shameless individual.  Who is crooked know how to use the situation and gain advantage.   THIS GUY IS GOOD FOR NOTHING
Seems this journalist doesn't know what is the law of the country in Sri Lanka.  How can we arrest or sentence someone due to somebody's accusation.  If MR is a thief let this people elected president to take him to jail.  How can we expect RW to arrest and sentence MR for sake of an accusation from people like this journalist 😂?
He lives in his own fantasy and no sense of anything, not at all...
In politics nobody is good or bad, every single politician has dirt on them, but selective journalism can make anyone look bad, let say you have two leaders, both have 40% of dirt on them? if people know only 1% of that? media can dig up and reveal 30% of one person to make that person look bad. AJ does the same thing here. They don't talk about Islamic extremism, Tamil terrorism, and all other foreign interventions.  Extremism measure was required to tackle them all to maintain the peace of the country. If government fought with them with human rights in mind, sri lanka is in chaos nowadays. sometimes the country doesn't need a hero, sometimes the country needs something evil to keep the evil out. I remember the history how JVP, LTTE terrorized the country for many years. most of the people who commented here have no idea about the history as they have never learned it before. or they are on the pay role of LTTE terrorists. Whether ranil is good or bad doesn't matter, he made sure he tackled JVP extremism, LTTE terrorism in mahinda rajapaka government, and finally made the country save from bankruptcy. let AJ to take care of the democracy of middle east instead of taking money of tamil terrorism to make sri lankan leaders bad.
This old man is at the wrong platform 😂😂😂 you cannot get rid of mehdi with his questions ...
Just wanted to know has mehdi hassan only seeing Ranil at rajapaksa birthday party singing, not the time ranil lost to rajapaksa ? But Ranil could have been sarcastic instead of getting angry
Ranil is covering up the most corrupt Rajapaksa family, who looted my motherland and led it to bankruptcy... I think they are relatives. The current president is the best leader our country has ever produced. God bless my beautiful nation..❤
Cooked 😂
Shame on Al Jazeera The Terrorist supporting channel.
Ranil is a coward. He destroyed generations of Sri Lanka. He should be jailed for the crimes he committed.
Excellent .Thanks Al Jazeera. But I want to say something.There was no genocide in Sri Lanka. It was a war between a Tamil group and the army. People in the Sinhalese border villages were also killed. Also, Sinhalese and Tamil people protected each other. Look at Sri Lanka today. Today's president was elected by the vote of all Sri Lankans. I cannot agree with that issue on Al Jazeera. It cannot be compared to the Palestinian war.
This man child is what we had to put up with last few years. You have to pray of us
Terrorizing people in the audience 😅
Mr. Batalande
Sorry for letting him represent Sri Lanka. 🙏🙏🙏
Bugger’s just dodging every question with straight up nonsense instead of answering. You can tell he’s stressed😂🔥
Ranil is a nut crack! Most low level behavior i have ever seen in life!!!
Imagine Sajith Premedasa is attending this interview 😂. Mehdi Hasan will turn dictionaries 😂
Wow Mehdi just wow a big salute from Srilanka 🇱🇰
Despite the lack of focus and ineffectiveness of the entire interview, one has to admire the sheer skill and style with which the former president Ranil smoothly escaped without actually answering the serious questions about his own and the government responsibilities in all the atrocities that took place in Sri Lanka during his 40+ years of political career. One cannot get angry with him because he is clever enough to detract from himself the blame for everything. Mehdi Hassan must have been frustrated that he couldn’t trap the old, wily fox
As a Sri Lankan, I appreciate Mr. Wickramasinghe for the way he answered. Although he is not in power at the moment and most of the questions were about times when he was in the opposition, he responded within the given time while protecting the sovereignty of the nation. He never allowed Sri Lanka to be put behind for the sake of his political career. A great leader!
You roasted him Mahdi ♥️
Ranil Wickremesinghe is, Batalanda murderer  Bankrupter Dictator Economic destroyer Gay Killer of SL intelligence units Fired Jaffna Library  Puppet of Rajapaksha regime
MR.Bean Wickremesinghe😂
Shame he is comparing himself to Gandhi, they preyed on poor Tamil people to stay in power
The man who was the big bull of the reason which Sept 20th many govt officials did OT.. by signing checks..😅😅😅
We call this guy Srilankan mr bean for a reason btw. 😆
Mr.. Bean of sri Lanka
Your political tricks only work to sinhalese mr rani😂
Is this LTTE propaganda being used against Ranil Wickremesinghe? The majority of the questions are not even related to him, as he has always been with the minority UNP. This was part of the U.S. liberal political agenda against Rajapaksa and Shavendra, but now things will change with conservatives in power for Rajapaksa.
28:00 I.. i.. i.. we we we... i i i..  What a joker
This SriLankan Idiot never being humble enough to accept that it was a extremely peaceful protest against Rajapkse regime.  As he has close relationship with Rajapkse's wife , he is always protect and cover up Rajapkse.  Furthermore,  tried his best to delay the presidential election by one year through dubious manner.  SriLankan hates this cunning idiot.
This interviever should be the president of sri Lanka..brave vice man❤❤❤
The best interview ever, no journalist has the backbone to question this thug like this. The best part 'I am a buddist' one day a person came to budda and abused abused abused abused abused abused abused 😂
this was just a look at the real gangster-esque political background of sri lanka. never thought would i ever see this but i really appreciate al jazeera's rawness  in the heated debate
This is an English spoken,  well-educated, high-class ශ්‍රී  lankan bastered.....who is part responsible for putting the country down to that bad level. ( money corruption / influencing 1000's of  youth killing / keeping under world gangs /  using executive powers to cover up corruption and murderers are some of the main accusations that could have been easily proved before the  law an order , if it was free )  If this guy had done this in a civilized western country, man must have been in jail for a lifetime... without any mercy and doubt.
RW is the Master mind and hero of Sri Lanka. We all respect him, If you don't know the truth please silent 🔕
I’m ashamed of my fellow Sri Lankans who make fun of our former Prime Minister. I understand he made mistakes, such as protecting corrupt individuals, but when the country was in crisis, he was the only one who stepped up, took on the challenge, and restored stability. Those who are cheering on Al Jazeera fail to realize that the channel has hidden agendas; they’ve historically supported the LTTE and continuously portray Ranil negatively.

You guys playing with Sri Lankan one and only Hittler 😂
This is called , rolaliy screwed 😅😂
Mehadi Hassan was brilliant. Ranil was rubbish as always
Very good discussion. Also, question Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu about war crimes and the killing of small children.  මෙය ඉතාම හොඳ සංවාදයක්! මේ වගේම ඊශ්‍රාල ජනාධිපතිගෙන් යුද්ධය ගැන ප්‍රශ්න කරන්න.පොඩි ලමයින් මරපු හැටි,කන්න නැතුව මිනිස්සු අසරණ කරපු හැටි වගේම  ධූර කාලය අවසන් වීගෙන යද්දි බලය තියා ගන්නද යුද්ධය පවත්වා ගත්තෙ කියන දේවල්.
He is a mad liar. Not a Buddhist  but he is famous as a cunning fox
As a sri lankan citizen , we  recognized the former president Ranil wickmasinghe is  one of the biggest criminals in our history . He lead the lots of illegal forces to kill the people like Batalanda . But  the question is justice .  We must say that this person should punished .

Has anyone lost a grandfather? 🤔🤔🤔 He's here. Please go and take care of him.🙏🙏🙏
And this journalist doesn't know that Cardinal Malcom Ranjith is a famous puppet of all presidential candidates of Sri Lanka. Once, he was a puppet of Gotabaya Rajapaksha too.  then ended up with him saying that Rajapaksha didn't give justice to Christian people and then became the puppy of candidate Anura Kumara, compelling the Christian people to vote for Anura. He is a beautiful Doll of all politicians in this country.I think he's gambling with those innocent Christian people pretending to be good leader in their community. Actually, he doesn't want justice for those innocent people the only thing he wants to play is politics within the board of Catholics during his term.
The worst Person who dont know why he born and doing worst thing to country.Thats why All of srilankan hate this 💩. Thnks Al jazeera❤
RIP RW...🤣
Someone could give him a glass of water 😀😀 I guess his throat was dried by the questions
what about the ltte terrorist atrocities Al Jazeera? how many innocent people were killed by their suicide bombers? they even used little children..  All your stage is filled with LTTE terrorists. they are really good at being the innocent victim with fake war crimes allegations against SLA
This guy torcher all of people in my country.😑
Oh Mr. Clean 😂😂

The questions are supposed to be directed at Rajapaksa, but this fellow is asking them to Ranil Wickremesinghe, quoting that he attended Rajapaksa's birthday party and sang a song. What a joke!
Its one thing to humiliate Ranil which he rightly deserves so, but all these people here praising Al Jazeera and this tamil diaspora, you seem to be having no problems of these people saying we had war crimes and only tamils in north suffered but not the sinhalese in south. shame on you
Mr bean of sri Lanka
RAJAPAKSA.   MAKE.  A.  PRESIDENT.   NOT SRILANKAN.   PEOPLE
This Al jazeera guy is making it looks like zelenski and trumph talk. This guy is the spurm from trumph. Week eggs.  Cheep arranged pointing at our Ranil wikramasingha. Fu  king mehedi We are with him, what ever said and done he is our Lankan.

The lack of accountability in Sri Lanka's political system has allowed corruption and mismanagement to persist, leading to severe economic and social consequences. Successive governments have failed to take action against those responsible for the bond scam and the Easter Sunday attacks, reinforcing the perception that political elites protect one another. The appointment of the Attorney General by the President, as outlined in the 54th Constitution, raises concerns about the independence of the legal system and its ability to prosecute those in power.  Despite initially supporting the Aragalaya movement, Ranil Wickremesinghe swiftly suppressed protests upon assuming office, highlighting a pattern where political leaders exploit public sentiment for their own gain. This cycle of governance has placed an immense burden on taxpayers while allowing politicians to evade responsibility. Without structural reforms, greater transparency, and independent institutions, Sri Lanka risks remaining trapped in a system where justice is denied, and public trust continues to erode.
Ranil is impressive. Totally put this ignorant, angry interviewer in place.😂
Those who says it will be a problem due to Ranil Wickramasinghe (RW) is the politics, may be because they don't like to see Srilanka to get prospered and develop.  Ranil Wickramasinghe is the man who took the challenge and geared the country towards the betterment from the catastrophic.  May be that is the reason this journalist is triggered😂
Tnx for interview this person..... He didn't do nothing to Sri lanka. He can't change never. Still thinking we are living in 1960, now world has changed. People in my country answered better, but still this old man thinking he is the only one. No word to tnx to him. Mgf1hfnbrvwshhqehehshbswhgqwvsejenvfnnda£%-&£:!

Ranil ❤respect for your strong personality. Shame on Al Jazeera and shame on some of the ...... (who believed Sri Lankans) comment against Ranil who did unparallel efforts to develop the country without a cent's benefit. He took Sirisena's and Rajapaksha's blames on his shoulders and responded as a true leader or father for all. Imagine if anyone else from Sri Lanka was siting in Ranil's chair?? What such parrots can do for economic development and developing other aspects of a country excepts talking?

This murderous, greedy man brutally murdered 60,000 young lives for power. He came to power by playing political games. He never got power through public elections. He misused the country's wealth. He is a corrupt Central Bank robber.
Well said RW 👍👏👏👏
ranil or Al Jazeera i don't trust  either of them, they all have their own agendas. None of those are good for us 😂
Answer is  No contest  🤦‍♂️
only mental man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a wonderful interview where a Sri Lankan leader hiding behind curtains is exposed for the first time for lack of responsibility for the citizens!
Yea laugh.. keep laughing… significant number of people died because of you !!!
I have used my votes against him at the election. But concerning answars about the war matters respect him around the bunch of *****.
Srilankan military and police also sinhala politician's also putha piku all were not honest people whatsoever if you want sir  please go to  investigate srilankan military and the former politician's also sinhala putha piku please do that for us please
Al Jazeera never supported to Sri Lankan they trying to destroy our beautiful country,
Very satisfying to watch real journalist like Mehdi grilling most corrupt politician of SL.
Where is my magic ring?
Hypocrite, must sendup in jail. He destroyed Srilanka.
Bro caught into an English speaking Chamuditha 😁😁😁
This guy.. ranil😂 and some sri lankans believe he was the best candidate
Madura Rasarathnam is Wife Of the Ltte political  wing Terrorist leader ...  😅😅 😂😂
RANIL TREMBLED AND IN BETWEEN HE ALSO FARTED 🤣
At least next time, this will be a well mannered interview and a respectful news broadcast. What he has done in his power are greatest of all. Such as pulling the country from near bankruptcy! Running on Disinflation. And to the people who thinks rajapaksha's appointed him, I feel sorry for the lack of knowledge! To be appointed through parliament vote is what happened there. After all the parties ran away from not taking responsibility is a joke. And for people who are dumb feels that it's a great interview, and yes. And on the other hand comparing Sri Lankan journalists doesn't mean this argument was won at all and no proof to boycott anyone whatsoever!
Why did he really thought what would happen when he agreed to go "head to head" with Mehdi lol
Well they allowed the other 3 ppl to speak more than getting the person to speak or answer.
අපේ නරියා ගූ නෑවා😂😂😂
Jaffna library burning led to burning of human flesh .
Ranil real fox the man who harboured corrupt politicians, drug cartels & murderers only his real face came to public when he robbed Central Bank of ceylon

Thank you Al jazeera❤
Shame
Srilanka jokar nambr 1 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 no like
Well done al jazeera
I sincerely appreciate your remarkable presence at the recent al Jazeera head to head TV conference held recently. We know the two hour program was edited to one hour and taken off the good points and explanations that you have articulated. Despite facing tough opposition from the host, panelists, and audience, your ability to respond tactfully and defend our nation's interests was truly commendable. Your unwavering commitment and articulate responses not only upheld the dignity of our country but also demonstrated strong leadership in the face of adversity. Thank you for representing us with such confidence and wisdom. Your efforts in safeguarding our nation's reputation on the global stage are deeply valued.
The guy came ready to fight Mehdi and nothing to do with all the allegations made against him plus his allies. very defensive old man.
He is the cunning politician but he cover the Rajapakse regime that’s bigger mistake he did
😂😂😂
250 people died because of these jokers. He is justifying his stands what kind of a leader he was...??
ස්තුතියි අල් ජසීරා සොම්බි බට ලන්දේ ගාථකයා මිනීමරුවා  කුඩේ කුඩු පට්ටම් කරාට 😂
Cringe.
The manner in which the interview was conducted and arranged makes it quite apparent that it is propaganda-driven.
I know what ranil wikramasinhe is doing now. He is a one of man who should responsible to sri lanakan economic crisis.  Economic killer of sri lanka. He will never get power from  election he know that very well.
Tnx Al Jazeera ❤
Sudda..😎😅❤
Sri lankan Joker 😂😂😂
Thanks Aljazira showing the world this animal is a certified donkey.
Great al jazira
Ferrari car got damaged 😂
This Ranil W was the curse for Sri Lanka, he was a killer and a great robber, he orchestrated Central Bank robbery, he brought one of his buddies a Non citizen of SL to mastermind this operation, he killed thousands of our young men and women in his Batalanda killing fields, for SL luck he is out now, he tried to stay in power  by postponing elections local govt and presidential elections…he was the Darling of very corrupt Rajapaksa family…
He is joker in sri lanka😂
This is pure propaganda! The former president handled it brilliantly and shut down all the noise. He carried himself with strength and dignity, proving once again why he’s a true leader. Glad to see the event wrapped up smoothly despite all the attempts to twist the narrative!
I wondered this was an interview with Mr  Bean.! SL politicians try to make jokes and disturb the flow by shouting and he is a master of it. Shame on him with the way how he granted the questions and poor answers. With people like this do you ever think we could build a future and psorpirity in the country?
Ranil Wikramesinha is biggest curse for our country.
😂
අපූරුයි රනිල්
The interviewer is purely disrespectful, dispite the political differences we should be against the the one who disrespect countries former president, instead it's sad to see people enjoying it. United we stand, devided we fall. One Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
Sri Lankan conflict was not just Mulliwaikkal. There were hundreds of suicide bombs in Colombo by LTTE, airport was blasted, oil stores were set fire. Major religious places blasted. Is it Al Jazeera’s stand that terrorism should have been allowed in Sri Lanka? Anybody who’s going to reply here just clarify Gaza first. Terrorism was not even mentioned here.  Considering the set up RW did a very good job in keeping his head up.
sri lanka no like nmba 1 jokar 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These old swollen headed politicians are a real curse for the country…. Yhis video gave me a satisfaction…. He is still running all over the world just to bring down the NPP government… This old swollen headed fox is really a cancer…. He keeps saying that he is in politics even before he was born… What did he do? Developed the country? He looted and destroyed it ….
This man himself represents much of the crisis!!
"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth." - Buddha -
Typical Third Class Royal College colombo behaviour. What a shame! All studied from Tax Payers money and acting like Posh Ponnayo.
Absolutely immature interviewer
Presenter was bombarding questions without giving President enough time to answer.  Presenter bit biased towards Tamil aspirations. 4:13 Riots needed to stop when a new president was chosen. 5:02 AI was a proxy of LTTE terrorists and in 2022 involved in regime change in SL together with  EU and US. 7:25 Ranil was elected by parliamentary majority when SL had a economic and political crisis. There was no money to hold elections. 12:15 Genocide was done by LTTE not by SLArmy. In a war people get killed and LTTE terrorists just like Hamas in Gaza used innocent people as humanshield and fired rockets against soldiers and jets. GTF , BTF should move on with reconciliation and rehabilitation. No need of war crime investigations. Look at Gaza and Ukraine and be happy it didnt happened in SL. Move on and give up hatrism and seperatism in SL.
පිනා 😂😂
What is this interview against Rajapaksha family?
Hasitha Wijewardena please learn from this journalist how to ask the valuable questions not like a Netflix & Nonses
Respect to the journalist ,from srilanka  Ranil is a fox he had lot of deals with corruption, not yet found the Arjun mahendran who robbed the central bank of srilanka
When your fake Ferrari breaks down😂😅
Mr. Ranil, you can't escape or hide. Mehdi is different level but mehdi raised question regarding LTTE war on ranil. He was a wrong person to ask. Ranil was never in the position when last time war took place. During ranil reign, ceasefire took place.
Wow even though I don’t like him and other political things but, Such a gentleman 👌🏾💪🏾😮
Forgive and forget is the ultimate form of justice and reconciliation. Not everyone will understand it.
Game over
Srilanka jokar  nambr 1
End of cunning fox, Ranil was the mastermind of Batalanda and lot of chos
Indian puppet real joker supported funded by outside interest group/country
Thank you Al jazeera .we are srilankan Tamil people 🙏🏿🙏🏿
This individual has done more harm to Sri Lanka than even the Rajapaksa clan. He single-handedly ruined the largest liberal democratic party in the country and has held the position of party leader for over 20 years, despite completely destroying the party. He is also linked to numerous murders, including the Batalanda torture camp. In the last two years, He tried his best efforts to reestablish the corrupt political order in Sri Lanka, but ultimately he failed.
Only jokar srilnakan men
This is true journalism, which never happens in Sri Lanka. Total impunity for politicians and people suffer.
This is hilarious. Ranil does not know what hit him
This guy is a joker and reeks of impunity. How he got elected so many times dumbfounds me unless he rigged or used other agents of manipulation. A few minutes in and I could read him.
We Sri Lankens suffer from suicide bombers... What these foreigners know about the war.... .  What a stupid program...🙄🙄🙄
Al Jazeera♥️♥️♥️
Sirilankan nambar 1 jokar ranil vikrama sinha no like
I like watching mehdi hassan interviews but this one is what i wanted most, ranil got exposed
I sincerely respect these journalists. Ranil, like a cunning fox, always tries to escape difficult questions by saying things like ‘I don’t know’ or ‘Prove it if you can.’ But this time, he couldn’t run away. These journalists have exposed him completely, leaving him with no place to hide. They have shown his true face to the international community, and for that, I truly appreciate their efforts. My salute to them and to everyone who stands for honest journalism
Ho Ranil, how many people died in the fuel queue ?  How many advisories you use for your last period
AL JACIRA😅😅😅😅 YOU LOST😅😅
Going around the bush  Utterly failed politician who is greedy forever for power.....  Curse to this beautiful country
Sad day for SL, embaraasing😢

Hey, all knowing reporter, you seem to be interrupting and not giving him enough room to answer. You’re coming off as impatient and not letting him speak. Why not give him time to clarify his points? You seem to be bulldozing through the interview. I’ve watched many of your interviews, and it feels like you’re trying to overpower the person being interviewed. Show some decency when conducting interviews. Your constant interruptions don't add value, and it’s frankly disappointing.

This is comedic gold
well ask the question for separate tamil state why not choose Tamil Nadu. name says it. you can have it !!!
Absolute cinema 😂🔥
Come on, Al Jazeera, let's not do such a cheap interview, I'm a Sri Lankan as well, but I never voted for any political party or politicians.  However what Mr.Ranil did during the uprising was a necessity to restore the peace and democracy which i believe most of the Sri Lankans appreciate without any doubts (silently) Otherwise, Sri Lanka would have ended up in same fate as what Bangladesh is going through now. So please, let's be more pragmatic. Thank you!
Ranil came to protect Rajapaksha..😂😂 thats why sri lankan reject this person 😏😏
It is inappropriate for a former president to behave so childishly. Ranil has corrupted Sri Lankan politics for decades, but no one ever questioned him like this. Thank you, Mehdi ✌️
Mr. Ranil Wickramasinghe says " I have been in politics even before you were born". What he doesn't say is under his leadership he has never ever won an election and become the executive executive leader of the country.  What a looser as a politician !!!😂
Bring mahinda and gotabaya next all these are same😂
This Culprit must be punished by law  i am a srilanken well done Al jazeera salute mehdi🙏👍
There is a proverb in Tamil that the king will kill on the same day but the God will kill little by little.  This is happening for Ranil fox.  Rest of the life, he will be dying of guilty of wrong doing against Tamils and the country. This interview totally shows his inefficiency and represents how Sri Lanka treated Tamils by its administrators.
Well fone Al jazeera
මේ ප්‍රශ්න ලංකාවෙ මාධ්‍යවේදියෙක් ඇහැව්ව නම් පහුදා ඌ වලේ
This is comdy
Ranil also corruption ledger only defended he became without voting
the person who is speaking in this video also responsible for economic crisis. he stayed in politics more than 40 years. He became prime minister 4 times in Sri lanka. every Sri lankan politicians always connected in a large corrupted system currently.
cheaters . upload 2 hour video
Dont trust ranil, He is the one who gave information about iran president after leaving srilanka he is no more  Innalillaahi wa inna ilaihi rajuhoon
He is a thief
Aljazeera ❤
Legend
Great interview but still, you should interview Rajapaksha!
Respect Al Jazeera..
“Don’t lose your temper!! Don’t lose your temper!!” while he was losing his 😂😂😂
Seeyata redhi ille! He may utter all kinds of lies but his squirming & closed up body language that get worse with each questions shows what the reality is.
Thats the best interview i ever seen with real journalist.
good experience with a real journalist!🤭
25:57 Sri Lankan Ex president farts during an interview 😂😂😂
Very good  question
Giving a mike to dumb media Person is like giving a gun to a monkey..!! so stupid and dumb..Through out the time he was asking questions not letting answers to raise…
It's VERY annoying that talks over and interrupts the person being interviewed. STOP IT it's bad journalism
Next time plz Invite ANURA KUMARA Dissanayaka.. 🤣
Kudos to the interviewer for their bold and insightful questions. If they were Sri Lankan, they might have faced severe repercussions from corrupt politicians simply for making them uncomfortable during the interview. This should be translated and broadcast across all Sri Lankan media channels.
This is srilankan devil
Thank you for showing the real situation of Ranil, Rajapaksha regions if sri lanka
RAJAPAKSA.   MAKE.  A.  PRESIDENT.   NOT SRILANKAN.   PEOPLE
Ranil left 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ranil...💪❤❤❤
😂😂😂
"සීයා " in a nightmare😂😂
It’s clear RW wasn’t ready for a real interview. When you don’t have power, the truth hits you like a speeding train.
ඇයි මුන්ගෙ වීඩියෝ වලට ඇඩ් දාන්නෙ නැත්තෙ? ඩීල් එකක් වත්ද?
Mahdi, you are just fantastic
In this discussion, Ranil Wickramasinghe remained loyal to his country and to the war heroes who fought against terrorism. I truly respect that. However, it's ironic that the conversation frames Tamils as the sole victims of Sri Lanka's war against terrorism. This perspective feels one-sided, especially since there is no voice representing the Sinhalese and Muslim communities who also suffered at the hands of Tamil terrorism.
Why is there are some cut scenes
I can’t watch this Ranil he is making me stressed
Thankyou Al jazeera atlease finally you brought this mad man to questioning in front of the world
Ranil wikkamasinha is The most defeated politician in the world 😂😂😂
Srilankan chamudidha = Al Jasi ❤❤❤❤

All Drama this Ranil. He is a Big  lier
Ranil is the only leader who can come an interview like this and answer.
Amu pissek Ranil
Although USAID is dismissed by trump on allegation of funding for power change for political agendas in bangladesh, Sri Lanka, .... IMF also playing still there dirty role of imposing unfair taxes to increase there unethical  profit making. As Gotabayas previous government decided not to go to IMf. Band public advertisement for wines & sprits, cigarettes. Decreased the unethical profit making out of vital drugs from suffering innocent cancer, and other  patients  All big pharma, money lending, ngo mafias.
Thank you so much Al jazeera ❤
Ranil always think he is a comedian , best interview and he faced real journalist 😂
Bro got smoked like 'Hit em up'
It is deeply frustrating to acknowledge that this individual played a significant role in the corruption that has plagued Sri Lanka. His actions have shown an unquestioning loyalty to the Rajapaksa family, whose record includes numerous allegations of corruption and misconduct. This kind of sycophantic behavior only perpetuates the political and economic challenges the country faces, hindering progress and accountability. The detrimental influence he had on Sri Lanka’s governance cannot be ignored, as it contributed to the systemic issues still affecting the nation today.
He does not want to contest for the presidency. But now, through his travels, he is trying to overthrow the current government. For this, he is seeking help from India and many international countries.  He is trying to save corrupt politicians and former politicians and also warns the countries that helped in the genocide. Most importantly, he is seeking help to dissolve the current regime. This is his dwarfism. He is a politician, but not an honest one. On the one hand, he has divided the Tamils ​​regionally and diluted the talks through Norway. He is the one who tore up the Chandrika-Tiger agreement in parliament. His hands are not clean. Only God can pray for the survival of this government.
Ranil pissek it’s true that he makes jokes nobody laugh
How many people were killed in Palestine and Ukraine...
It is pure comedy gold – a masterclass in dodging every question with his signature ‘no contest’ routine! If only his policies were as evasive as his answers…
President Ranil Wickremesinghe ❤❤❤❤❤
Never a fan of Ranil but his firm stance against the butthurt peelamist's whining is to be commended ❤ . ඉතුරු ටික ගැන නිම් ඉතින් මන් දන්න නෑ 😂😂
Al jazeera salute🙏 great well done👍 i am a srilanken i would like to see this Traitor in jail he is a badest politician ever in srilankas history yes.
Ranil is a big lier. He said SJB members voted to be the president. It’s wrong. And this guy don’t have any knowledge about politics. If he’s good to manage our country wel, why srilankans didn’t vote to him on 2024 election.? Because we all know about his character. He knows how to destroy peoples dreams. The interviewer was 100% right. And also The Supreme Court of Srilanka mention rajapaksha family was involved to the crises which our people was suffering still. And world knows how this Ranil & rajapaksha family destroyed our country. Hats off for the interviewer.👌
Well done Ranil Sir !
Bro didn't laughed with cunning but always showed cunning with laughter 😅
Respect Ranil.. Whatever  your political view.. You stood for Majority Sinhalese and Buddishts.. I have a huge respect for this.. ♥️
Hope that you'll be better mannered - that’s all, MEHDI
Nobody could defeat him. But you are one of the best journalist who really challeged him 😂. Respect man🎉
Obnoxious interviewer.  Could please let the man speak.
would like to know the view of this Madura Rasaratnam  of suicidebombing of LTTE and killing innocent people , where is the justice ???
No no no no... You you youuu.... No no no 😂
He is cheater
Well done, Al-Jazeera .
Ranil Rajapaksha cunning fox ruined  the country  protect Rajapaksha family
Ranil ❤❤❤
Western media have been trying to establish a false view for many years about SLn war .....That s why they repeat   "war crimes. war crimes.."  To the all the sense of words war is a crime. War is brutal. human lives have to be sacrificed. Blunt Western media distort the truth about the war. they don't know how citizens have been living fearfully for 30 yrs. They think the war is  against Tamils. Nobody sympathizes when Sinhala people die. Westerners didn't know what really happened during the war.  Proud about President RW and his calm nature during the interview. He did not get excited for questions and the audience. Great leader.
This whole Interview was lasted 2 hours, but you published only 49 minutes , you published what you want us to hear, because of Sri Lanka is poor country or what ?
Ranil tried to evade tough questions by joking around it or threatening to leave. This is exactly what he's been doing to the local press but failed miserably at the international stage.
Why don't you talking about the human right violation your European countries during colonization and what about the people killed by European armies by imposing martial law😠😠😠😠
AL Jazeera biased against Sri Lanka
මේ නාකියා ආගමත් පාවල දෙනවා ඌට බේරෙන්න තුක් නොදකින්
This interviewer is GOLD. He has done very good homework. Ranil is exactly the other part of country's collapse. Ranil Mahinda together ruled the country for 20 years and made it bankrupt.  He did not get country out of trouble. He only got Rajapakshas and fellow ministers out of trouble.
Mehdi hasan should do interview  indian pm or indian ruling leaders
EXCELLENT.   PROGRAM.   AL. JAZEERA.   THANKS
Literally, he is a journalist. Not good at having propositions and making the problem solved. Nowadays, it is going to be denoted that a journalist/word-breaker is a tool for defending their proposition, not for the asset to the truth. I think this tendency will never be changed. So I decided for myself to be the better by considering the objective truth without being dynamic to the newest trend at all. The world is totally getting weirdo! Not day by day, second by second.
RANIL
මේ ඉන්නෙ අපේ ලොක්කා 😂😂😂😂😂
Ranil destroyed this country during his political carrier more than 4 decades.
Great Leader Ranil
This is how he run this country thats why  its fail😂😂😂😂
According to Mehdi, Mahinda Rajapaksa is a war criminal. According to the two female panellists, the Sri Lankan army bombed hospitals in the North. This is what you call “මූණත් එක්ක තරහා වෙලා නහය කපා ගන්නවා වගේ” (cutting off your nose to spite your face).  What is it, Sri Lankans? Did our forces kill innocent Tamil civilians?  All these people are asking for a separate Tamil state. Madura Rasaratnam, in her book, mentions that the LTTE was part of a broader Tamil nationalist movement. She never condemned the LTTE for suicide bombings or child soldiers—did she?  And now, you are applauding them.  If RW has committed illegal activities, prosecute him. But don’t let your hatred for him make it seem like the general public accepts what these people say about the war. It wasn’t a civil war—it was a war against terrorists.  Think…
Only guy I saw who was able to gracefully escaped from Medhi is VivekR, RW just went into a bloodbath 😅
Ranil was tha main caracta to sri lanka cryciss.he was robe tha central bank in 100days
Aljazeera has missed a very important question which is how you have robbed the Central bank and why you have tried to influence the investigation officers to hide it after it's leaked.  And also, I would like to ask the audience to compare the Gaza war with Sri lanka. Sri lanka fighted with world's most powerful terrorist group who had the same level of military power. So that, expecting 100% justice and try to bring the officials who had taken the leadership to eliminate the terrorists to the custody, has to be considered fairly. Because, we know the pain of our own wounds better than others...
Ranil is the most disgusting political leader ever to have been elected as a pm and selected as a president.
What kind of nonsense coming out from aliens. You all don’t understand the cultural and social fabric in Sri Lanka mainly guided by Lord Bhudda’s teachings. In furtherance, you are unaware of realities in SL.
Now you know why he couldn't be the president from an election.
RANIIL.  NOT.  RUN   THE.  CUNTREY.   I.M.F.. RUN.  THE.  CUNTREY.
Invite shehbaz from Pakistan
Well done. Ranil you are looser, people are laughing you M F.
I'm Sri Lankan; I lived during that time, and Runil Wickramasighe is lying through his teeth. moment he took power. he used millitery, PTA. he postponed elections.
At least ranil never steel money
Attorney General is one face of the government he is not independent at all
Just beautiful Mehdi! Absolutely beautiful! There's a reason why he's still one of the best!
He is a dictator, a man whose actions have caused great harm throughout his life in parliament. His time in power has been marked by decisions that have negatively impacted our lives. He will likely be remembered in history books as a political fossil of Sri Lanka's parliament.
“Never in his 50 year political career has Ranil Wickremesinghe faced an interview quite like this. His playbook when facing a foreign journalist is to lie and divert, confident that they won't know enough about Sri Lanka to call him out.  However, credit to Mehdi Hasan. He had done some research. There were parts where even he didn't know enough about domestic affairs to counter RW. That's understandable, as SL has little significance in global affairs. But it's the best performance ever by a foreign journalist against RW.  Unfortunately, no Sri Lankan journalist has carried out a hard hitting interview like this with RW. I doubt that will ever change.”  ✍️Charindra Chandrasena  (Copied)
Thanks to Mehdi and Aljazeera
Al Jazeera ❌ Tiger Jazeera ✅
Proud that I didnt vote him
This man is don’t know how to interview ,He did not give the time to answer the question .
Ranil & Rajapakse evils  killed sri lankan peoples.
He must explain the crime that Hague committed during his mandate with his Rajaphakcha family
This person is a Parasite for Sri Lanka
Salute 🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌 you  The people's journalist... He asked everything with nice examples... please translate all to Sinhalese than Sri Lankan can understand everything..
The one and only leader had a vision to developed Sri Lanka but always been rejected by the Sri Lankans. Unfortunate of them not him 🙏💚
6:41 රනිල්ට කනේ පහරක් 😂😂😂
We can call Al Jazeera as Tiger Jazeera , they will talk about all the problems faced by srilankans but they didnt do anything for any country. Also they need to underrated our leaders not only ranil , you have to be shame on you    also our people cmnt here about the ranil about there past Shame on u as well.
Pls bring next interview kaputa paksa and co 😂😂
😮
When he meets a real journalist he tries to leave
The unwavering stance of the Sri Lankan people, who have sacrificed their lives in a humanitarian operation to prevent thirty years of inhumane LTTE terrorism and protect the right to live for all, regardless of race, religion, party or opposition, is the following.
Aljazeera’s asking me to be respectful and constructive! 😏🥱
So now the world knows why Sri Lankans don't vote for him to be the President of SL.
This is what Sri Lankan Media needs. Not the politicized media personnel or the scattered fashion of daily news.
People often fail to recognize Ranil's true worth until the day he is no longer in power! Even jeppo knows it!!
RANIL  .SAVE   THE.   ROPER  &.  THIFS.   POLITICIANS.  RAJAPAKSA.   FAMILY
Ranil was professor which university you were studied😂😂
ජාත්‍යන්තර සබදතා 😆ආසියාවේ සුපිරිම මොලය😆 කියලත් කිව්වා🤣.....ජාත්‍ය්නතරේට විහිලුවක් වෙලා ඉවරයි🤣.ලංකාවේ නමත් ගාවලා😭😭...මහ ලොකු පලපුරුදු නායකයා......😭😂
It's very clear he is a slimy cunning fox. Always be ready for an alternative answer for all the faults (relevant or not ) made use of Buddas coatings. That WAS Lord Budda 🙏🙏🙏 Ranil is not👹🙈🦝🐷🐺 . I am a Sri Lankan 72 years old. Seen, gone through lots of politics. If one says NPP is wrong and a lie, it's the best (no other alternative) wrong or lie to us ( our country ) If one want to get in to politics/power, has to do one step better than NPP. 🫶🫶🫶🤲🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏 No more dirty politics.
Ranil is such a fool
what is the difference between a civil war and terrorism 0:45?  Scale and Participants:  Civil War: Involves organized groups or factions within the same nation fighting against each other. Typically, the conflict is large-scale, prolonged, and involves conventional military forces. Terrorism: Usually involves smaller, non-state groups or individuals using targeted violence against civilians or symbolic targets to create fear or influence political decisions. Objectives:  Civil War: Generally aims to seize political control, achieve independence, or drastically change the political structure of a nation. Terrorism: Primarily aims to instill fear, influence public opinion, destabilize governments, or achieve political or ideological objectives indirectly through psychological pressure. Tactics:  Civil War: Employs conventional warfare tactics, including organized battles, territorial control, and sustained military engagements. Terrorism: Relies on unconventional tactics such as bombings, kidnappings, assassinations, and sabotage, deliberately targeting civilians or symbolic locations to maximize psychological impact. In short, a civil war is characterized by organized internal conflict with clearly defined factions and military confrontations, whereas terrorism is marked by strategic violence designed to generate fear, usually involving smaller groups and civilian targets.
අඩේ, මෙන්න ඉඟ්‍රීසියෙන් සලකුණ යනව. සුදු චමුදිත කෙනෙකුත් ඉන්නව 😂
These guys are questioning from our former president like they are very grateful people this is the channel what supported to LTTE these guys don't talking about the rights of sinhalese and there is no one to talk about sinhala people. Also this guy is thinking that we are a colony of them since recently. They are supporting terrorists and they don't talking about the civil rights of palasthene people 😠😠😠😠
Ranil Rajapaksha!
Chad Ranil 💚💚💚🗿🗿
Mehdi had Ranil for breakfast.
Pride about you Mr Ranil wickramasinghe ❤❤❤
He is too long in politics he can’t handle a proper interview, in Sri Lanka he was given questions in advance
Well done al Jazeera 😂
mun batalanda krapu dewal nisa ape hamudawa ltte ewuntat ehema kala kiyala hithanne
This is the good example how Rajapaksa ferking Sri Lanka Ranil Mongal political pimmpiya
As a host, mehendi should behave in better manners. He never let the guest to finish his answer..
RW waz speechless and i felt like he having hemarrhoids
Tiger jazeera 😂
Ranil wickramasinghe is a work of art.
RANIL. MISS.  USED  TAX.  PAYER.   MONEY  SRILANKAN.   PEOPLE  REJECT.   2.  TIME. THE. ROPER.   NO.  CHANCE.   IN.  SRILANKA.  .R.I. P. .
Please play the full video without cutting for 49 minutes.  In Sri Lanka there wasn't any kind of civil war. Who helped them to grow killed by ltte leader. Those helped are given by the Tamil politicians. But all of them were killed in an earlier stage by ltte. This is known history and the media presenter should read those before holding this kind of interview. ltte's brutal killing, anyone can  Search those in the internet or paper reports . You would see How rude it is. Ltte never respect their ppls. They only Respect to the money and the power. I really sad to see the youth of Tamils without finding the truth they stand with the funded reports. Someday they will understand what they are all involved in. We always give out love and friendship for any ethnic group in Sri Lanka. This is what our strength is. But be careful with those  scammers in society. Especially those funded media reports or funded groups reports.
Thank you Al Jazeera. No one do this in sri lanka.
He is a theaf and he protected all theaf
Ok
Al-jazeera 🫡

Well done RW. This Journalist is based on lies agreed upon by themselves and put questions believing them as true
Ranil hats off to you sir...good defense. This is ambush journalism
Classic political question d
Ranil played all the cards that worked in Sri Lanka: 1. Threatening to walk out 2. Shouting 3. Bringing up Buddha or saying "I'm Buddhist" 4. Deflecting questions 5. Stupid jokes, act like child & Laughing
What a brave man, every one including the presenter were attacking him. He still faced the interview
He didn’t care about the people, he had a lavish lifestyle at the expense of others
Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe is one of the best leader in Sri Lanka.  Because when the country was collapsed in the moment, even the present president refused to accept the country. But the people of the country were under their conspiracies.
no one talked about majority how they survived in the civil war, all against one man
This man is very stupid. He did not give the time to answer the question .
Mehdi Hasan ❤❤❤❤❤
Diaspora?
Hat's off to you Mehdi. This man Ranil is no better than Mr.Bean.
Ranil's hand with blood of 60000 people killed during 88/89 era in Sri Lanka.
26:24 reminds me of aladin😂
HE.  IS.  A.  NOT.  SRILANKA.   PRESIDENT.   HE.  IS.  BUTEYFULL.   SRILANKA.  DESTROYAR.  GREAT  BANK. .ROPER
Aljazeera interviewer just says his opinion with sarcasm when RW answers and move to the next Q. That gives the impression that the answer was not valid. This is just word play and psychology. This journalist does not have the basic ethics of a journalist. He just wanted to corner RW. It is good that RW told about the bad behaviour of the journalist . The journalist must learn how to make a proper interview with some respect. He just wanted him answer as he wanted. It is a shame to see the way he interview.
18:20 let him completely state the nuances.
Major curse of the Sri Lanka. Please translate this to sinhala and broadcast in Sri Lanka 🙏
finally someone taught the narcissist uncle to behave.
Ranil Rejected people in Sri lanka.

Without ranil wickremesinghe hardest  effort  to safe the country, surely we dont have a country  called sri lanka to talk anymore . Respect  and thank you president  to saved us.
Pitty Sri Lankan 😂 To have this kind a leaders
So, all the Sri Lankans commenting against Ranil here want him to accept that Sri Lanka has committed war crimes? Mehdi should have asked these questions to the Rajapaksas, not Ranil. Just because he sang at a Rajapaksa party doesn't mean he's responsible for everything they have done.  Regarding the Easter attack, if 53% of Sri Lankans believed it was a political game and that the Rajapaksas were behind it, then how did they secure such a huge victory in the next election? Even the same Cardinal who now speaks of political games,  promoted Gotabaya Rajapaksa in that election.  Are Sri Lankans' memories too short to remember this?
No time given to answer ugly media only can do this👎
Rw telling lies about  his appointment as president.
Monawa unath ranil bosa polim tika sin gala nti krl rata normal kala ekai aththa.
ඔය වගේ සාකච්චවකට අනුර ගියොත් රෙවිලා marenne😊
😂😂Funny eh? Now imagine Anura Kumara in this situation  😂😂
Ranil paid $ and make this conversation with Al jesera ranil is laying 😂 not respect to the people that's y he lost the election.
Ranil is a murderer, corrupted politician who was kicked off from sri lankan politics.
ඔය වගේ සාකච්චවකට අනුර ගියොත් රෙවිලා marenne
well done Al Jazeera 👏👏👏
Al jazeera state run Hipocrasy channel  was well trained by Maharaja it seems.  well done Mharajooooooooo
Bring MR a day here
බුදු හාමුදුරුවෝ ත් විකුණනවා මු..
I believe he never faced a real journalist 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Please publish the full interview, you cut the interview to one hour and present a wrong idea about ranil wickramasinghe. As respected media channel, I expect truth from your channel. Thank You! 💔
Well done Al Jazeera. Why don't ask about BATALANDA MANY ARE KILLED BY HIM
Just to see the thumb nail says Legacy of war crime , are you referring to Great Britain for the war crime done for last 300 years.
Useless stupid typical questions.  Arabic version of Suranga / Camuditha. As the world knows, Al Jazeera is always one-sided. However, people who sold the war and settled in the western countries enjoy this type of drama. As a Sri Lankan, I am with Mr. Wickramasinghe to defend the country.
Superb! AL Jazeera. Thank you so much for your effort.
Made a joke of himself!
A good journalist. Studied very well about all things. Well prepared. Good job Mr.
Sri Lanka tamil's curse never sleep you.
Mr.Bean next level .
Ranil  is the Father of Central Bank of Sri Lanka bond scandal
Political fox 🦊 changed as wolf
Mehdi, when is the first interview like this with Qatari or Arab leaders? Asking about public funds, accountability, human rights of their own people and expats, conflict of interest, women rights, labor rights etc 🤣🤦
He is just a liar. 😅
Ranil wickramasinghe failed in his usual tricks , I think the interviewer is well educated regarding wickramasinghe's behaviour. On the other hand we should also feel sorry as wickramasinghe took measures to solve country's problems eventhough the solutions were not perfect.
A group of LTTE supporters made strong efforts to target Ranil and Sri Lanka, throwing false war crime allegations. Meanwhile, JepiBaiyo who can't understand a word they say, got overwhelmed in the comment section just by hearing the word "Batalanda"
Father of Central Bank of Sri Lanka bond scandal
please keep him with you , don't let him to come to sri lanka
RIP Ranil 💀
We don't care this little tigers 😂 .
if ranil is gae, mahinda is his bae
The interview was not well conducted by the journalist, but indeed, this man is responsible for the situation in Sri Lanka. However, he did some good as well. The LTTE is a terrorist group, and most of the audience here are pro-LTTE. I'm glad that the LTTE was destroyed. The interview should have been more balanced, and we want to hear the whole story. This was a proper setup, and these people are still talking about war crimes. If you ask that audience, not a single one of them will accept that the LTTE was a terrorist organization. The whole point of this interview was to prove that there were war crimes. Of course, crimes were committed by both sides—Tamils also killed pregnant women and skinned people for sandals. Yet, they only talk about war crimes on one side. Now, live with reality—there will never be a separate country for tamils. The country is recovering, so do not destroy it again.
Respect to Al Jazeera for showing real side of corrupted politicians in Sri Lanka
It is well known Ranil’s failing economics. 1. He alone took more than 13 billion dollar  loans for the  country with highest  interest rate.  These are facts . None of the projects made profitable to the country while he planned to sell state owned assets to India and others during his leaderships.  2 . He has many allegations which he skilfully and politically escaped. Former president Chandrika, Rajapaksa helped him to escape from those in different era. 3. He had alligation  for maintaining alleged detention centres which killed and raped young activists in Sri Lanka . Famous one was Batalanda detention centre. He was a main suspect during the hearing at the courts. Unfortunately all the evidence were brutally buried. 4. Investigations to central bank bond scam under way !!!! Guess who is behind?
👍👍👍
Rest in peace Ranil Rajapaksha
Ranil Wickremesinghe has a bad history..  indeed, a serial killer  brutally killed young people in Batalanda  Camp .. some young boys were sexually abused by him ..   He is a well-known criminal in Sri Lanka..
Sri lanka❤
රනිල්ගේ මූන...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂ඌට ඇඩුනා යකෝ...😂😂ඌ අපේ රටේදි ප්‍රශ්න අහද්දි දාන ගොන් ට්‍රික්,ගොන් ආගමික ජොක්,, බලු උනා යකෝ..
Nice drama 😂😂😂
He didn't save the country it is the people who saved the country with their own tax money
That interviewer really likes to listen to himself talking. Guy talks like 80% of the time.
this man is the root of corruption in sri lanka
he is the definition of racism and bro isn't even trying to hide it
We fall... but we rise from the ashes like phoenix.  Politicians together with LTTE terrorists tried to ruin our country's unity. Now Tamil diaspora is still trying to scatter the country's unity based from Western countries. Kudos to Rajapaksa regime to bring peace to country from 30 years of Civil war and protect our country where its now. But they couldn't last it due to western , India. So many Western countries,  Neighbourhood countries doesn't like SL to be developed. Let's see NPP government formed purely by majority citizens of the country.
Why no one asked about new born babies killed by LTTE? Why no one asked about bomb blats did by LTTE targeting civilians in south? Why no one asked about killing Kadirgamar former minister foreign affairs ( who was Tamil)?
He is a genuine  liar... he and his rajapaksha ghosts bend all the laws for their benefits... Rajapakshas appointed him as a shield to cover up their faults...
How can gotabaya be arrested without a single charge ? Moron
What’s the point if he doesn’t give any chance to explain?  If it’s Yes or No.
What do you know Aljazeera, Ranil the dog is the father of corruption in Sri Lanka. he killed people, he sold Sri Lanka to get power and Money. what a dog
Rajapakse family and Ranil both are curse for Sri Lankans.
Western is western, No changes could be seen for ages. sometimes good at theories, yet not at propositions, if we judge them through their Media, regardless of considering whether it is UK or not.
This Qatari propoganda channel should be banned from YouTube 😂😂😂
Thank you Al Jazeera for the revealed who is head of the Batalanda to the international community,We called RW in another name as "Batalanda tormentor"(Batalanda Wadakaya)

This is not a real journalist. He is known to be one-sided
RANIL makes a fool of himself 😂in front of an imminent panel and audience ❤❤ what a shame 😢😢
Please convert this interview to sinhala srilanka people  definitely need to watch this.
I am just in 7 minutes of the interview and i feel sorry for ranil already.  I would like to see Basil and other rajapakshes on an interview as such.  And i feel like Ranil should have got more time to explain his points too.
If mehdi hasan let Ranil to fully answer he will clearly clarify all allegations but he shuts his mouth with jumping over him. That means mehdi has some answers on his head.
Ask the Indians what they did too
👍
தமிழ்
As a Sri Lankan, I want to say.The first time Ranil faced a real journalist. Ranil is a thief and criminal, who destried of sri lankan peoples life and future.
Murderer Ranil !!!!!!!!
He didn't put the economic on track lol, he is track XD
Thank you very much for exposing him for what he is..
Al Jazeera consistently portrays Sri Lanka in a negative light. It is important to remember that Al Jazeera has a history of disseminating misinformation, even during the civil war, and has consistently supported the Tamil terrorist organization, ELAM. Sri Lanka is an independent nation with the right to make its own decisions.

RW is the biggest political crook in the country. His few close political friends as well some others like the MR regime hand over him the power for all their survival and had amassed great amount of money  through  corruption  practices and political influence.  This man is a total disgrace in SL politics and  will never win an election through people’s vote 😢
Ranil is a nasty, corrupted and a lier ( murderer in the 80”s)
Well done Al Jazeera
He helped the Crises. But he helped the people who put the nation in Begging situation.Insted of investigat what happened to Bilions of dollers he help to escape
It is clear , he had done many corrupted things.
As a regular viewer of Head to Head show, this was hilarious.
No one is talking about brutal killing done by LTTE, LTTE killed their own ppl.yet no one  said a word against them.
They were not peaceful protesters. They were funded by NGOs in US and EU. Houses were burnt. one MP was killed. Most leaders involved (Ratta, Dilan Senanayake, Darnis Alli) were allegedly funded by those NGOs. Same time the US ambassador to Sri Lanka was going out of her way and influenced Sri Lankan government unduly.
Government must work in order impose law against this corrupted murderer

Thank you Aljazira. Though this man suppose  to be the cause of many conflicts in Lankn history kept denying!  That's  why he is known as "sutra puncha"!!
He is a blatant  lier...no one agreed to go for a presidential election...  We all wanted the provisional election. He says he didn't have money for elections but donated millions to the ministers who have "so called the peaceful  protesters" damaged houses...
My satisfaction level while watching this interview 📈📈📈📈
What a clown! Ranil wickramasinge is 🤷

Victims of the civil war? That explains the agenda of this talk. There's alot of money coming in your way when you talk against the war against terrorism. 😊
Wow! When will Al Jazeera establish democracy like this in Qatar and the Arab world? 🤦
රටට ලැජ්ජා කර කර ඉදින් නාකියා
True Sri lankans love this interview ❤
No contest 😅
Al Jazeera 🔥♥️♥️♥️
Al jazeera Next interview sajith premadasa , and namal Rajapaksha pls ,
Kuwait srilanka 🇰🇼🇱🇰 🙏
I don't like him as a politician. But what he told about civil war, hats off for him. You better wear our shoes, if you want to talk about it. What you talked about his protection for rajapaksha and his political agenda, ya that's completely truth. But when it comes to war, we can't solve it by meditation. If they shoot, we have to shoot. That's how it's going on like it's happening in gaza. So mind your own business or you had to live here to talk about war crimes. Grow up mehdi 😅
Mr.been interview🤣😂
BATALANDA LEADER💩💩💩
Respect to the journalist. Love from Sri Lanka

Great journalist 👏
Thanks for the title " Mr Establishment " no other title fits this man. !
First 8 minutes and the so called journalist wouldn’t let him respond. If you’re going to make allegations, the accused party - Mr Ranil, he should be able to respond. This journalist is an absolute joke!!
It is a well-planned game by the host and attendees. Thank you, Mr. Wikramasinghe, for representing the country.
Al Chamuditha
Rajapaksa is a great thinker than Mozard ! Joke of the century!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Praise for Mehdi Hasan and Al Jazeera for firm questioning him.

පොනිල් 💩💩🔞🔞🚭🚭
Batalanda 😂😂😂😂😂😂 RW you afraid 😱
Sri Lankan here, some more facts from the ground and from someone who was at Temple Trees when Gotabaya resigned:  - Sri Lanka's protests were amongst the most peaceful in the world, the image Ranil is painting that parliament and the capital were in complete chaos after Gota's removal is COMPLETELY FALSE. Ranil himself said he would "step down" if Gotabaya attacked protestors. The army were sent to dismantle the main protest site that was miles away from parliament  - Ranil DID NOT appoint Nandalal (his party actually attacked Nandalal) nor did he start talks with the IMF. Both are things he's tried taking credit for  - India gave us $2 billion before Ranil came in to power and as a resulted solved the fuel crisis. This is something Ranil repeatedly pretends never happened to prop up his "saviour" image  - Multiple crisises happened during Ranil's tenure including an unchecked hunger and medical one. This was repeatedly kept on the down low to help with Ranil's image despite the problems reaching insane levels to the point where a corrupt MP from the previous govt imported fake medicine  - The economy "stabilizing" is quite literally due to the govt turning off most of the economy and waiting it out, the immense pain the public felt during this process is not to be trivialized as if it was a gentle process, it was a culling that depended on foreign aid and a huge amount of support from NGOs and charities like Save The Children  - The suicide rate stopped being recorded during his tenure  - Cabraal (the governor of the central bank who suggested printing more money) was removed by Gotabaya and not Ranil. By Ranil's logic should we praise Gota for that or is this just common sense?   - Ranil's election history does not mirror Thatcher's at all, Thatcher won 3 elections in a row and made huge changes to the country before rightfully being kicked out after her 3rd term   - 15:22 is very much true and a crucial point, the common excuse from Ranil apologists is that he's "powerless" but the fact is there were cases that indeed could have easily been re-opened   - Ranil prevented any reforms and aided members from the previous govt, he held no credible inquiries in to the Rajapaksas and did nothing about corruption, none of the Rajapaksas faced any punishment or were prosecuted in any common sense faculty (evidence of crimes is overwhelming). Yes, our attorney general is corrupt, this is a fact that Ranil pretends isn't true and again, its obvious when blatant crimes have been committed by both him and his Rajapaksa friends (Ranil sending the army to GGG for e.g. is a blatant violation of the constitutions and was publicly televised, the proof is overwhelming). If justice takes this long despite overwhelming evidence then he has failed regardless of his intentions  - Ranil's entry in to politics is directly a result of nepotism and not merit and his uncle was the president who started a 30 year long race war  Ranil is a psychopathic liar who preys on pseudo-intellectuals and is the face of pretentious politics. His legacy of 50 years of politics will be that of a loser, one can only imagine he even accepted this interview in the first place as a desperate attempt to win back validation from actual smart people otherwise there would be no reason for him to do this
Ranil to Mehdi: "you're off your head".  Former President of Sri Lanka, ladies and gentlemen. Former president. 🤡
ranil is joker
What kind of deference had with Ranil Wickremesinghe's politics he nailed it when it comes to one of Al Jazeera's favourite so called innocent cute pets truly brutal terrorists . Poor souls day dreaming about never getting their so called dream land Tamil Elam 😂😂😂😂
Mr RW, he is not Chamuditha / Chathura or any other Sri Lankan joker. He is a aljazeera journalist.  Siya you were not on point you showed afraid in front of him.   RW pls go out from our country.
Up until now, he thought that with his English, he could easily fool the less fluent people around him in Sri Lanka. However, on the international stage, before a global audience, it is a shame. His knees are shaking, and his hands are sweating. These same questions were asked in Sri Lanka, but they were answered either at a Montessori level or denied with witty responses. He believed that,  the less fluent people in Sri Lanka could be deceived, but that’s not the case.
Ranil wickramasinghe said at before once time, I'm Donkey & Dog.
Politics snakes interview with reel journalist.
The interviewer had a separate agenda in order to embarrass the R.W. and also, the interviewer is really unprofessional for being in this discussion because his motivated agenda. Disgusting to see
His insensitivity and ignorance is the very reason why he got kicked out from the presidency by Sri Lankans. Clearly seen those poor qualities in this interview as well. Now the world would think all sri lankans are like him - with that arrogant attitude. Shame!
In contrast, some individuals may find it amusing that he had performed positive actions for the country. It is important to recognize that not everything is negative, and he served as the former president of Sri Lanka. As a Sri Lankan citizen, we must respect him. Furthermore, many individuals who attended the interview fled Sri Lanka during the civil war and now reside in the United Kingdom. They often express aspirations for an independent state called Eelam, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the events that transpired in Sri Lanka over the past several years. Selfish individuals seek justice for missing terrorists during the civil war. It is crucial to acknowledge that many of the Tami people residing in Sri Lanka are genuinely good individuals who love their country and coexist peacefully with the Sinhalese population. Those who find it amusing should understand that he was the former president of Sri Lanka and deserves our respect. It is essential to refrain from judging individuals based on their personal preferences.
Ltte killed innocent sinhalese civilians in North and East.ltte deployed child soldiers in the front line .what a shame.criminals
No one remember how LTTE killed innocent peoples on the road, bombard on public transportations, religious places. Only concern is about their defeat even after 16 years. They are unhappy because LTTE lost.
same things happenig herein Balochistan and KP in Pakistan
Do you think this guy was a president? None of the issues fell under his responsibility.
RANIL 😂 Joker 🃏no wonder he is termed Mr Bean 😂😂
Do not panic Ranil 😂 Just answer to the questions  Everyone knew the truth 😂
Mehdi Hasan is a fraudulent "journalist" who interrupts his guests and employs logical fallacies to fool his lukewarm IQ leftist audiences
Rajapaksha ranil gotabaya serisena candrika bandaranayaka  specially ranil Wickramasinge very bad political person 🧍
සිංහල සබ්ටයිටල් දැම්ම නම් වටිනවා.🎉
Tbh Idc about what he's done at this point. Sri Lankans praise Al Jazeera while the interviewer trys to put our country down. Watch the part that he accusing about he doesn't like EU, UN. Ranil didn't said that and interviewer put those words upon him and didn't let him finish. He's not Just Ranil Wickramasinhe there. He's representing Sri Lanka. He indeed brought our country to better through a tough time after Gotabaya. We should give credit where it's due. And also he should be punnished for the crimes he done aswell. This is western propaganda ppl. Wake up
Ranil Wickremesinghe has played a big role in Sri Lanka's politics, especially during the JVP insurrection and the civil war. The Batalanda Commission accused him of being involved in human rights abuses, like torture and illegal detention, but no legal action was taken, and he has denied being responsible. he defended his actions during the 2019 Easter bombings and said the Attorney General, not the government, makes decisions about prosecutions. He also denied being involved in war crimes or torture during the civil war. While he hasn’t been legally proven guilty, his actions during these times still bring a lot of criticism. He can’t be accused legally without proof, but his legacy remains controversial, with many questioning his role in Sri Lanka’s violent history.
Thanks aljazeera ❤
Why dont you talk about the brutal killing done by LTTE for 30 years?
👏
Ranil is a fox He should have been in jail some times back
අනුර එන්නේ කවදද මේකට ? එදාට සිර්සෙ සුරන්ඟව දාන්න කියල බල කරමු අල් ජසීරා එකට
Ranil joker
Why the fk did he agree to this LTTE backed BS.
You questioned him for last 10-15 years crimes. His roots goes way beyond those. He and his uncle were behind 1983 black July, burning down Jaffna library. Two key incidents led for 30 years long war. 1987-1990 Batalanda torture camp (which was Ranil's amusement park), look at his reaction when questioned about it. "what report, its not tabled, I can not accept it". This guy is ruthless murderer, you all can see it with his answers.
This thug is politician for 55 years.did all dirt
In Sri Lanka, Tamils could buy land from anywhere but Sinhalese aren't allowed to buy a land in Tamil areas that what is going on in Sri Lanka. Now that women say Sinhalese encroaching Tamils lands a Total Lie. This Whole Interview is Based on Lies.
2 hour program cut off to 49.27😂😂 We want to see all program not this one.
Next anura kumara with an interpreter.
This man known for his arrogance that why people never accepted as  leader of Sri Lanka.
❤ third class journalists have to understand the basic ethics of journalism rather than interrupt during other host speaking and giving the answer. The people who doesn’t know the ethics who asking questions about 30 year history of Sri Lanka. 😂
Thanks Al Jazeera for asking the real questions
So as for him the cardinal of the Catholic church is talking nonsense 😅
Ranil is an elite class crook.
Head of Thieves
He is one of busted politician
plz invite 1 of our generals from Pakistan, they should face such interviewer
Mr Bean on stage.. 😆😆😆  36:28 One of his  boyfriend.. 😂😂
Game exposed
Please bring Mr.Anura Kumara to the stage 🔥
This mtfkr is always a disgrace, but look at the audience and the panel; all are well wishes of Ltte terrorists.
Without Ranil, Sri Lankans wouldn't even have electricity or internet to watch this.
A person who knows little about Sri Lanka has gathered unreliable rumours from the Tamil Diaspora and tried to confront Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, which ended in a humiliating defeat. Mr. Wickremesinghe, in the future,  make sure that you avoid spending your time on such interviews.  @RW_SriLanka2024
For Viewers who watching this outside sri lanka - There was no civil war between sinhala and tamil people. There was a war between sri lankan forces vs tamil tigers (LTTE). LTTE was a terrorist group which banned in many countries. They a lot of a lot of people including new borns in a brutal way.
and just like that al jazeera became BBC 😂 time to unsubscribe... worst interviewer ever... ask a question, interrupt midway and proceed to lecture with a dash of virtue signalling reminds me of sunday school Medhi maybe you should find a new job you'd be a really good sunday school teacher .... just an idea
Omg Ranil 😂 27:20  He was a joke
Most of the crimes did by Tamil Elam Tigers....by cornering the civilians....at mulliwayikal
I can't believe that some people in the country still want this lunatic in the parliament
Chamuditha English version 🤣. Journalist not letting the interviewee finish what he says
As a Sri Lankan I applaud this awesome interview hahaa. Mehdi didn't pull any punches. Corrupt Ranil Wickramasinghe was really uncomfortable 😂
අනෙ අපේ කජූ සීයා
this man v angre with  srilankan becose one time he dind came prasidand  thats why? 😅
As sovereignty of sri lankan we should be proud.Where someone from our nation to talk about what happens during war. You can't put all the blame to government of sri lanka. Even LTTE did many war crimes bombing many mosques and Buddhist temple. But people of this country and future  generations are still paying the debt which happened for pass mistake. People who  settled in Western countries by selling war scenery enjoys there life style...  But we still love our one nation one country.
He is the person of curruption and murder.
Mehdi Hasan on fire 🔥
Al Jazeera is a media outlet that has distorted the dialogue and is obsessed with money. It was a channel that showed fake news to the world during the war in Sri Lanka. Where is the rest of the interview? May Al Jazeera, that media outlet, rest in peace.
This journalist is a real jerk.He is not having a discipline at least to give a fair time to give an answer to the question he asked. If the current SL president  is in this seat , (who is the hero of the most of the people who commented in this video) can't imagine what will happen to him.
Ranil is a great leader who survive Sri lanka from bankruptcy.Its disgusting sling mud to such a leader without having proved accuracy
Sorry to say, he became a laughing stock in the modern era of politics. His mistake was defending 'Rajapakshas' who were kicked out by the people.
Great interview by aljaseera
RANIL never answered your questions .. looking straight in the eye 😂 shows he is bluffing...big time bluffer😂😂
Bro got cooked.
බටලන්ද වධකයා left😂
You cannot bring to justice, corrupt individuals of a kleptocratic system that worked hand in hand to benefit themselves when their job was to work for the benefit of the nation.
HE is almost 45 years in parliament he dint do anything in to country only tried to sale the country with Rajapakse 😂😂😂😂😂😂to China & India 😂😂😂😂 f
welldone. Thank you aljzeeta 🎉
Bring mahinda rajapakasha and: he's brother gotabaya next
The hatred these people have with the Rajapaksas is well visible. Today we are alive because we have ended that terrible war that lasted thirty years. This is a Buddhist state. We will never allow the foreign Tiger sympathisers living abroad to rule Sri Lanka the way they want. We love the Rajapaksas who protected our country then and love them till tomorrow. Please do not be the third class people who are looking for garbage in Sri Lanka.
Why you interview corrupted and young peoples murder in srilanka  And this man was a trying to sell srilanka land and property of government  This person isnt good person
Can u please do investigation about what JVP party did things in 88 to 89
So called Sri Lankan master mind got roasted 😅
This is a very good interview , at least the people who think Ranil is the best they can see what Ranil has done in the past ..  Ranil is a very cruel person
Thanks Al jazeera,,,, I'm a sri lankan.. ❤... This is "THE FOX" master of crime
Proud of you Mr Ranil Wickremasingha to have patients how rude this journalist is but he got this is done delebrately to put Mr Wickremasingha into shame by the Jvpers in UK as well as Sirasa
Tamil 🎉
Catholic church is doing politics. .this fool should be prosecuted
Respect Ranil for showing up to this interview. Sad his friends are corrupted and bloodthirsty bunch.
Ranil is a liar. He is trying to take advantage of religion by quoting on some fairy tails.  Big liar.....
Shame on you ranil Rajapaksha
Ranil 's  real character is open to earth. Who is the Killer of 60 000 people with children. Hatts of aljasira ❤
His new name  is Ranil + Rajapaksha  This is the answer...
No journalist questioned him as you did.  Finally RW met the correct person. Mr. Mehdi Hasan you gave him a tough time. Well done

Bring Jamal on board 😂
I watched this nonsense media game. They are trying to convince others to think rajapaksha family are criminal. Poor Sri Lanka. Surrounded by NGOs and terrorist group’s money. What I understand in next 30 years they are will be no power for Sinhalese in they own country. Young generation they have to understand and need to be united to protect the country. We have to drive them to understand what is happening and make them  prepare for it.
The majority of comments on this forum do not realize the gravity, their intention is to criticize RW. Nevertheless as a real leader ( world-class) very well said
If someone asks modi like this, he would be missing the next day.
Give this man an Oscar. I think RW probably peed his pants
Highly corrupted politician.
❤❤❤Thankz mehediiiiii.......
Our Politicians are not honest. They are cunning and  play games.  End they become failures.
1:27 Didn't you find a representative for a Sinhala human right group ?
don't loose ur temper
tamil tigers are the once who laughing . they are very much like that their plan successful.. aragalaya made their dream cometrue, weldone mr.ranil.respect
Ranil is guilty.should be jailed.
Mr RW, he is not Chamuditha / Chathura or any other Sri Lankan joker. He is a aljazeera journalist.  Siya you were not on point you showed afraid in front of him.   RW pls go out from our country.
How ever Ranil   that maneged well. Journalist 've got  well knowledge about Srilanka political History...
Asks from the culprit 😂😂
Ranil officially crazy 😊
Well done Al-Jazeera..❤
Go check Gaza. Afganistan etc
Bro this is not fair  Ranil Wickremesinghe will not get a chance to respond.  If you can get the new president anura kumara dissanayake to this interview you can probably can tell he was a liare . People are in Sri Lanka knows the truth the diaspora needs anura  But ranil is a real hero   And now the new government is a mess the people's are know it I'm challenge in this person here who interview ranil please get the president or some one in the parliament to this interview they were liars
Ranil local tactics didn’t work with Mehdhi, out played & humiliated
they try to prove sri lanka don war crime
Great interview and must see all sri lankans
Poor Ranil shouldn't have gone for this interview; he cut himself a sordid figure in it.
Ranils ego got inflated by his stupid followers last couple of years. Maybe that’s why he chose to face this interview thinking he can use his usual tactics to deflect and manipulat.I strongly believe he basically destroyed our country because he enabled Rajapakshas by always heading the opposition but not really doing anything to save our country from them because all he cared was for the UNP party leadership.
Finally,  Ranil has found his  " Waterloo " in London..😂
Protector of Criminal Rajapaksas
Think this is the  first time who interviewed Ranil after doing homework . Lot to learn from that .  People who likes Ranil will think he batted well like in sri lanken pitch. Actuality he got out this time on overseas pitch without scoring .
Seeya forgot his pamper!
Newetheles nice interview you have done, I feel in personal Al Jazira only chanel only do their interview with Asian countries, I like to see if you chanel come out and do like same interview with US president or ageinst any other country
Mehdi sounds like Sri Lanka's Sirasa Satana crew. He's arrogant and has no respect for the person invited to this discussion.  Just like the Sirasa crew, Mehdi doesn't allow RW to finish but keeps interrupting. He's kept faith in media reports and has apparently not researched the credibility of them.  Mehdi evidently brought in a panel that's totally prejudiced and all-out to discredit RW.
it all peaked at 17:22 and 35:15 😂😂😂😂
This interview was biased against Sri Lanka! Shame on you AL Jazeera
Thank you Al Jazeera 👏🏻
Ranil protected Mahinda - Rajapaksas looted SL = Ranil supported the corruption done by Rajapaksa Regime
👏👏👏👏
Ranil wikkamasinha isn't our president 😂😂
Tamil diaspora vs Ranil. That’s what it really is.
Idiotic interviewer with a knowledgeable  Leader. This idiot interviewer is just barking not allowing Mr WICKRAMASINGHA to reply. Also  Most guys who came up with questions are fake and well organized 🤣😂  Ultimately people couldn't hear anything worthy because those idiotic interviewers Barking . Al-Jazeera should educate their reporters to be truthful and come with real evidence to interview someone of Mr WICKRAMASINGHA S caliber.  Hats off to Mr WICKRAMASINGHA for making Al-Jazeera a joke factory. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ranil, You can't buy Al jazeera  Good job Al jazeera ❤
Watching this interview, I am afraid that there is no strong, informed leader in Sri Lanka at this time. This is an attempt to plant the terrorist ideology that was defeated in Vellimulla once again through the puppet leader called Anura
These people who are raising these questions doesn't know anything about the War was in Sri Lanka, we lived here we suffered here had rajapakshas not led the War and generals not Fighting it the War was still Going on and still the LTTE TERRORISTS killing Civilians. Rajapakshas and Generals are Hero's for Sri Lankans. Why nobody is mentioning How LTTE TERRORISTS killed Many Civilians by setting up Bombs in public Buses and Trains  Why these international Human Rights called organization Silent About them. It's a War just like every other war had been. There weren't Human Rights in Any War which occurred in the history of the World. Get real, don't Ask Stupid Questions.
I'm very sad to hear this.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is the biggest thief & cheating politician who ruins the country. Never won Parliament election by his team & always a loser.
GMOA... please watch the interview? Do you all still want Ranil to enter parliament again? Ranil... Real joker exposed in front of mass audience who were laughing and shaking heads
Ranil is a joker. whenever he get's a difficult question he jokes out of it. For the first time he met a real journalist
මීනීමරු රනිල්.දේශ ද්‍රෝහී පාහරයා..
Ranil is look like a Clown here.
Dude come on. Bro thinks it's a game show to reply with funny quotes and fairy tales.
Actually world is failed to done the prosecution again the mad man. At least al Jazeera is doing some job.
Puka dennepa. Al jazeera kindi danne lankawata. koti tikk dagena puka denw
THIS IS MY ROMAN EMPIRE NEVER IN MY LIFE I THOUGHT MEHDI HASSAN WOULD TALK ABOUT OUR STRUGGLES AS SRI LANKAN TAMILS.
Just leave the politics perspective behind and See the big picture.  Something really fishy
Biased questioning, misdirected accusations, curated audience, an extremely prejudiced panelists. I think the former president did a decent job.  You need to give a man some breathing space to answer a question. As a viewer, even I am confused with what is going on.
I
Ranil is a joker accidentally he became a president of country
Nice program good questions ❤❤

He is also scarmmed fr srilanakan government and in that diffcult times he had 64 servant fr his house and cooking.. he gd frnd of rajapksha... he is main reason fr this infulanction .. fkng theef he is
First  We thank to AL Jazeera Journalist. Bravo. Mr. Ranil you can't escape.
Pure lier ..he do not answer question .😅Ranil acussed this inrerview is edited...he had two hour interview
As a srilankan citizen. I highly recommend this full interview should be subtitled using sinhala and tamil language. For those who cannot understand english can realize mr. ranil wickramasinha finally become mr.bean at end of the interview ..
Massive thanks to Al jazeera 🙏🙏
Mehdi Hassan should compete with Gordon Ramsay for his cooking skills
Good job president ranil for dealing with these Diaspora interviewers. 💚
Lol 😂😂😂😂
This journalist behaves like, "Look at me, I am the champion before the audience. I will ridicule this guy from Sri Lanka." But Mr. Ranil Wickrmasinghe displayed an admirable sang-froid.
in the batalanda case, Ranil rajapaksha is shaking
Corrupted Biased Woodpecker got entangled in Banana tree when it tried to .peck
Good job president ranil for dealing with these Diaspora interviewers. 💚
Shame on your channel. How much pay for this interview 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
This man looks like a comedian but number one crime and done concentration camps in 88.
Ranil rajapaksha, this name explains it all.
There had never been a Civil War, it was just pure terrorism which was initiated by the so called tamil leaders with the blessings of India, and unleashed on SInhala majority with the blessings of EU, UK and US. no one is here talking about the sinhala people who got killed in their thousands for 30 years by the tamil tiger terrorists movement. and most of the people and the terrorists who claimed to have been gone missing are in Europe, UK and US and India under fake passports. and i can see some of them are there in the Audience with their new names.
Ranil you well managed all the questions. Ranil, you are truly a person who is committed to peace, but you answered many questions that are not relevant to you as a true Sri Lankan. The damage to our country's economy due to the LTTE and JVP is more than 250 billion dollars. That is one of the main reasons why our country fell into economic crisis, at that time you came forward and saved the country from it, the way the journalist acted without even giving you a chance to speak is very unpleasant. But you answered all those allegations with great restraint and responsibly before the international community. This JVP government is running like this because of Ranil's actions at the IMF, it doesn't matter..someday the truth will come to people's attention, time will explain a lot.
Ranis is not in neutral
This chap is never a genuine politician he's  responsible for ruining this blessed paradise; together with the corrupted distorted ex corrupted presidents and distorted ex corrupted parliamentarians: ( apparently we Srilankans citizens want him in JAIL, in PRISON: 🤔
He is an most irresponsible president in the world.💩💩
Hats off for President Ranil for dealing with these joker interviewers 😂bros not even giving him a chance to answer. How disrespectful. Shame on you al jazeera
This person is really not seems to be a impartial journalist. He acted with some  Ultramotive interest.....like a u tuber....in srilanka.  Aljasheera should be ashamed to send a person in this nature for public interviews.
Ranil rajapaksa finish😂
OMG Ranil why did go there 🤣🤣🤣
Thankyou Mehdi Thankyou Al Jazeera ❤
අපරාදි මූට මේකට ආවෙ කියල හිතෙන්න ඇති🤦🤦
Do you know how this man totured people in the batalanda "His generals would put a pen in the ear and hit it hard"😢 😢😢
This interview made my day
Spend more and more money on these things D'pora. You guys will never win. You don't know squat about the Srilanka war. You cannot do anything. UK maggots.
බැන්ක් එක උස්සලා අර්ජුන් මහෙන්ද්‍ර්න් කියන හොරාට  දිලා සල්ලි නැහැ කියන කැත 😂
This man has a conscience, this man lies to act like a clown. When you listen to that conscience, you will understand it.
Mehdi hasan your a great journalist in the world 👍😍
It was evident throughout this discussion that the anger in the West to end the war has not yet subsided.  interview  mostly deals with the thirty-year war and the events that took place in its final stages to obtain the question paper.  Mehdi Hassan tried hard to get Ranil to admit that war crimes were committed in Sri Lanka, and that war heroes like Shavendra Silva who were on the front lines and the commanders Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya were the ones who committed them.  Ranil saved them all in front of the international community, and it is his personal opinion that the international community has no right to come out and say that the thirty-year war has ended.  If Ranil had been a traitor to the English Tamil diaspora and international organizations, this questionnaire could have been milder.  Hassan quotes someone who is not as knowledgeable about international politics as Ambamal Renuwaka as attending Mahinda Rajapaksa’s birthday as a big deal.  Throughout the discussion, there was a need for revenge against war heroes for ending the war by the pro-LTTE Tamil diaspora.  Despite the hostility he has faced in his personal political life since 2005 and despite his usurpation of the prime ministership in 2018, Ranil Wickremesinghe has shown the role of a true patriot by not betraying war heroes including Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya, Shavendra and others in front of the international community.  The international community, which is talking about the deaths in the last week of Mullivaikkal, has not said a word about the hundreds of thousands of people killed by the Tigers in the South over the past 30 years.  Domestic problems should be at home, and outsiders should not be allowed to have domestic problems.  This government will also have to face a similar situation in the future. At that time, this government must choose whether to betray the war heroes and get Western favors, or stand up for the war heroes and the political leaders who led during the war.  Despite the many mistakes of the Rajapaksas, because of the leadership he gave to end the thirty-year war, everyone as a country should stand with him to support all the patients coming from the international community and the diaspora.  (Not about the frauds and corruption that occurred after the war)  Finally, my sorrow for the runaway jeppa who is running away with Ranil Wickremesinghe. Ruvin Fernando
Kulla nari ranil
THIS GUY IS CORRUPT TOO
Al jazeera pls translate this to sinhala pls there are some people who think k this evil man is a saint but he is part of the problem
Ranil was  now mad man  ( sayko) person
Ranil faced real journalist
I always saw how srilankan political leaders get away free hand after committing so many actrocious crimes.  I'm so glad to see and thankful for this interview and not letting this criminal leave scot-free. Well done🎉 Aljezira.
A truly strong interview would balance tough questioning with deep analysis, allowing viewers to gain a clearer picture of both past failures and future possibilities. Some interviews focus on assigning blame rather than deeply analyzing the root causes of Sri Lanka's crises A good journalist should allow to answer the question without interrupting. Many Head to Head interviews rely on aggressive questioning. While this can be effective, excessive interruptions or confrontational tones might not allow the guest to fully explain their stance.
Srilankan shame temporarily leader. Also suspect at lot of civil murders. Anura kumara disanayaka please say something 🎉🎉🎉🎉
It seems all these questions are taken from a dumb Sri lankan
it's his real face, he protected dirty politicians not his people.
Interviewers accent and speech accuracy nothin wrong   people's know who is out of head
Ean manasula iruntha baarame koraanchiruchiii
He's one of the main corrupted politicians so far. He has the most dirty politics Sri Lanka has ever encountered
Ape Siya kude kudu
Good job president ranil for dealing with these Diaspora interviewers. 💚
Ranil flew all the way to the UK to get roasted. What a mastermind 🤣🤣🤣
This guy ochestrated the ki**ings and tor*uring of thousands of innocent civilians under his watch from 1970s to 1990s as minister of industries,youth and education (with the support of his uncle who was then president)..he can deny these allegations but those were proven facts with evidence under a presidential committee.but none of our former presidents had the backbone to prosecute him for what he did..its a tragedy this clown became president of srilanka later on and still in active politics..in 88/89 era sri lanka was referred  as a land of can**balism because of this mon*ter.. Both of the regimes who were ruling sri lanka upto  now were covering for each others heinous crim*s..thats how they survived this long..
Good job president ranil for dealing with these Diaspora interviewers. 💚
Good job president ranil for dealing with these Diaspora interviewers. 💚

Should send AKD to Aljazeera too for an interview like this.
This guy is a best journalist from Al jazeera.👍👍👍👍
Bro came to get BBQ’d 😂
It happens when you drive a ferrari in sri lankan roads
Mehdi has done highly critical and organized home work! anyone can learn a lot about Sri Lanka from Mehdi, than Ranil Wickramasinghe. Mehdi one of my respected journalists, thank you Mehdi for hosting  this discussion.

Ranil is rajapaksa family friend We don't like him Because he also with thieves
This thief is stolen our nation. Ranil is the biggest thief in our country. Don't vest the time with this thief
Mr. Ranil Rajapaksha 😂
Superb interview thanks Aljazeera
This is how you take down a foxy politician 😂
The former srilankan Hannibal
This man is a good example for Sri Lanka’s 70% of the population in deceitful.  their full time job is how to oppress minority community and take country to bankruptcy with stealing public funds foreign aids and label minorities as a worst people. But opposite
Since 1983, the Srilankan leadership claimed that the greatest threat to Sri Lanka is from the LTTE and hence justified the ethnic cleansing of the Tamil minorities.However, we have seen in 2022 the real threat is crony capitalism coupled with a disregard for people's resentment.
He is also responsible for the crisis.he had been on parliament  for 3decades.
im not proud of this Ranil Rajapaksha speech he is a like child.... i couldn't watch continuously bcz Ranil Rajapaksha couldnt do speech about postively Sri Lanka.... Gama kanwa maru international wadda
British people audience who enjoy this you better go and meet tamil people who vitnessed the  war in sri lanka ,about fabricated war crimes  to be honest to yourself if you want to know the truth only. Terrorism asked for a war and they were Officially defeated by war just because they killed1000 of civil people demanding another part of sri lanka. Tamils would hurt it because the LTTE Terrorism  based on Tamils. We admit one thing that is this is not a honest politician to both sinhalese as wel as tamils though.
Al Jazeera should be ashamed.
This?  F****** man is a bank robbery, man.
Thanks Al-Jazeera which you show the real face of this JOKER Ranil.
This is pure comedy
Ranil , who is a criminal , should be in prison  not giving interviews .
Ranil broke the country
I dont  see this video
Oh my god who is this interviewer, and the other two women. Apparently they are pro LTTE. Don't intervene in our country's issues. We will solve them. Try to get UK back on it's feet. Get lost and respect Sri Lankan citizen's wishes.

Ranil Wickremesinghe robbed the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and protected all thieves involved in bribery and murder. He helped the Rajapaksas rise again and continue their corrupt politics. He is nothing more than a joker.
ඉස්සර ඉදන් කොටින්ට කඩේ යන Al Jazeera එකට දැන් ඩෝබියෝ හුරේ දානවා. උන් ranilta විතරක් නෙමේ මුලු රටම තමා චාටර් කරන්න හදන්නෙ😂 තාම මුකුත් කරගන්න බැරුව ඉන්න මාලිමා කාරයොන්ට ඉතින් මේවට තමා දැන් චූන් වෙන්නෙ😂 නිකමට Al jazeera + Srilanka+ War වගේ keywords youtube එකේ search කරල බලපල්ල. ලංකාව ගැන එක හොදක් හරි කියල තියනවද කියල😂
Shame on you Ranil . you said “ politics of catholic church”
What about all the Sinhalese were killed including women and children???

How dare u talk like this.
He is representing dewadatta boddas main foe atotal lier
I have great respect for Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who led the country during an extremely difficult period. Unfortunately, I have noticed some negative comments directed at him by a few individuals, which I find unfair. Many of the issues raised against him were not his sole responsibility. As a proud Sri Lankan, I admire his courage to stand before a diverse international audience—many of whom hold critical views about Sri Lanka—and represent our nation with dignity.  Finally, I warmly invite you all to visit Sri Lanka and experience the genuine hospitality of our people. Then, you will truly understand the kindness and character of the Sinhalese community.  Hats off to Mr. Wickremesinghe!
good bye ranil the mass murderer for ever, you are ruined after  this interview🤣
He is trying to parliament.Musalaya.
President Jayawardena is His uncle.(Who is responsible for 1983 Riots) He is responsible for killing thousands of University students. (Batalanda) He is a demon. He is also a close  friend of RAJAPAKSE mafia. This guy should be in prison for life. He is not a Buddhist but Satan who is trying to hide under Buddhist Robe.😢
He put us all in to shame. Now Whole world knows.👍✌.
Next bring Gota on stage
අකුදි ට පරිවර්තනය කරලා යවන්න ....... මෙතන කරන්නෙ රනිල් ආයෙ උඩට එන එක නතර කරන්න ...... මේ කරන්නෙ ලංකාවට ගහන එක
Mr. Bean real version 😅
Easter Sunday attack = Islamic terrorist attack
No messing with Mehdi
Why dont you talk about the brutal killing done by LTTE
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mehdi Hasan should have the Balls to question 🇮🇱 Israel leader against  crimes against humanity at Gaza! Which he and his biased channel would never have
Excellent & bold interview… well done presenter…👍
Ranil is a shameless person. has done lots killings and frauds. His appointment of Head of police & central bank are hiding from police in the face of law
Caught the jackal. Well done, Al Jazeera.
Finally he met a real journalist and got hammered 🥲💥
Sad to see people call this a good interview.  Despite the fact that he was 3 against one, they should've let the man answer.  Kudos to Ranil for standing his ground!
" they are all friends"
oh man , thank you so much for this, as a sri lankan I feel content after seeing this, it is not a secret that he is responsible for most of the extra judicial killings happened in sri lanka between 1980-1990 as well,
This is a father of ruined srilanka 🤬🤬🤬
mr bean of srilanka🤣🤣
Getting Cooked by International Media😂😂
He never won an election. He got everything for free.
Sri lankan peoples enjoy this show watching children drama
The one thing he said that is correct is that there was no civil war; it was a terrorist attack for 30 years.(Tamil terriost attack)
Bro thought he can handle international media like the media in SL 🤣
Hats off for President Ranil for dealing with these joker interviewers 😂bros not even giving him a chance to answer. How disrespectful. Shame on you al jazeera.
ඉල්ලන් කනවා කියන්නෙ මෙන්න මේවාට.😂😂😂
The Ferrari has met with an accident. 😂
The incumbent is the most corrupt politician in Sri Lanka after the Rajapaksha gang. He didn't even attempt to accuse the Rajapaksha of their crimes. Instead, he robbed the central bank of Sri Lanka in the early stage. He brought one of his friends to the central bank and appointed him as the head of it. Then they robbed the bank, and this man sent him to Singapore for a wedding. That man is still at the wedding, and this man is laughing. Also, Sri Lanka's economy was collapsing when he lost the election in 2019. Ranil is not a mastermind. Big F for this corrupt politician.
For the last 70 years the politicians has been avoiding questions the way Ranil did today. Sri Lankan Press was always protecting the politicians. Good questioning, thank you.
Most disrespectful person in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankans most awaited interview with the man who killed thousands and who is responsible for its bankruptcy.  Good job Al Jazeera
Thank Aljazeera
He cannot face a real interviewer. He lost his control in first 2 minutes. He even forgot his English when Medi asked real questions that matters to people
අනෙ බුරු පුතේ
He's the one who destroyed Sri Lanka.
Five minutes into the interview, Ranil be like, give me Chathura Alwis or Dilka Samanmalie.
ranil and rajapaksha family must responsible to happened srilanka crisis. basil is the first blame one
Hyyoo ranil
Ranil was responsible for SL central bank scam and   these politicians wasted country and the result was bankruptcy.
Kohomada kema.. අතිවිශිෂ්ඨයි.
Thanks for the interview.
Thank you Aljazeera. Ranil is a corrupt politician, also he has killed lot of young opposition members. He should rot in jail
Former president Ranil  had never faced  teribel interview in his life befor.I congratulate  the person one who interviewed. Ranil scared too much. Rani is the one who  curupted whole sri Lanka.
He violated people's right of voting try to fold  political map his uncle faild he too faild so people's oust him from power political dust bin  he is a lame duck
as we can see former president ranils international supports got overloded😅🤣🤣🤣
RW did good against චමුදිත හසන්. Defended Sri Lanka. Good job ma boy. ✌️
Thank you Al-Jazeera. This is the first time he's been questioned like this; something he likely never expected.
ඔබ විශිෂ්ටයි රනිල් මේ ජනමාද්‍ධ්‍යවේදියෙක් නොවේ LTTE එකෙන් සල්ලි අරගෙන මඩ ගහාන්න කොන්ත්‍රාත් එකක් ගත්ත ගෝත්‍රිකයෙක්
Medhi is annoying we have a similar journalist personality in sri lanka asking questions not allowing a response 😅
Dude let him breathe… 🤦🏻😮‍💨
Mr Bean
Thanks mahdhi....🙌🙌
Ranil absolutely correct about the civil war. We never started it. What about the tamil 🐅 brutal killing
Lot of sri lankans who watch this who dont have adequate English knowledge will claim that Ranils fluency is so cold ability to have international relations😂
America has committed the worst human rights violations in history, what have you'll done about it.  SL went through the worst terrorism and the only the country to come through it, which again some are not willing to accept.
Thank you very much to the announcer. Thank you for speaking the truth without any bias. As a Sri Lankan, I respect you, Ranil Wickremesinghe is a thief.
Why the interviewer not giving enough time for guest to answer?
I think Mr.Wickramasinghe did well. This journalist is a sico.
RW❤
No questions, Runil is devil👺
Ranil W took tough decisions that stabilized the country.  He could not do anything to the Rajapaksas because he could only rule successfully with parliament support.   He ensured a free and fair presidential election was held.  All of this made it easier for the current government to do what they are doing today.  Having said that, he came to power under a Rajapaksa majority parliament. He lied that he got elected because of the SJB and Tamil parties. These parties only had about 68 seats in a parliament of 225. Ranil got 134 votes.  About the EPF, he lied. Even though no money was taken from the provident fund, the changes made ensured that the member of this fund would lose around 47% of what the fund would have generated for them in the next 16 years. People are losing money on this even today.  He dissolved all committees/commissions when he came to power and shelved all investigations carried out a few months before he became president. This would have led to investigations into Rajapaksa regime financial corruption. Instead, Ranil appointed new committees that were filled with Rajapaksa stooges. The COPE committee became a joke.  Ranil's house fire was a shady incident. There was a suspiciously sudden power cut at the time. His former chief of security was caught on camera at the location without proper explanation.The police attacked reporters unprovoked at the time to draw attention to this incident. It seemed as if he wanted a reason to get tough on protesters and used this incident for his violent actions.   Ranil does not care about human rights violations.  He always appoints dummy investigations/ commissions internally just so that he can say he did something.  He never supported international inquiries against the Rajapaksas.
👍your every answers are excellent Sir!
RW - I have been in politics before you were born Mehedi - some might say Its the part of the problem💀😂
Ranil is known as a cunning fox. Who wasted money travelling abroad. Terrible at answering questions from international media. Avoiding the questions. Shame on him. Still holding on to UNP without letting someone else lead. Just before the elections wasted money from in the youth council. Supporter of the Rajapaksas.
The interviewer has a set plan question but RW faces perfectly.
Let him speak
Najua Kenyas mko hapa kuangalia ama kimani ame recover from the last weeks’s knock down.😂😂😂
You would have asked about batalandha 😀😀😀
Ferrari met with an accident 🤣🤣🤣
අම්නේ අපිව වැල් පාලමේ ගෙනිච්ච මුත්තාට වෙච්ච දේ 😅🤣
No one in SL question politicians like this. This cunning man came to this interview just to get some fame from locals, but instead of that he got roasted.
Someone please do fact check with this pinokios' answers
Ranil😂😂😂😂
One of the most stupidest President in the world.
Most Crooked politician in SL........
😂this  guy  is crazy  he can't  give  answer  to you
September 21 අනුර දින්නට පස්සෙ thank ranil කියපු ගෝතයන්ට පෙන්නන්න ඕන මේවා 😂😂😂
This man is not a real journalist.  He is a immature baby journalist. Journalist should try to get the information to the public but this man so called himself as a journalist blocking information from Wikranasinghe. I was watching to see the answers from Wickramasinghe. I am lost without answers to the questions forced on Wickrsmasinghe. Wickramasinghe was not allowed to explain any thing. Journalist was made himself a jocker.  Journalist was hurried to question wickramasinghe with questions pre-prepared. Journalist was anxious and over exited to question wickramasinghe but not ready to receive answers from Wickramadinghe. This is a failed interview where people watching lost in the conversations without answers to the questions forcussed on wickramasinghe. Journalist anxiety and immaturity to the job was clearly shown in the program.
A completely biased interview in which Mr. Wickremesinghe was not given adequate opportunity to answer satisfactorily, with constant interruptions from the curt interviewer. Having said that, there were instances in which Mr. Wickremesinghe’s responses belittled the gravitas of the issues being discussed—a pure issue of attitude.
සිරිකොතේ ගල් කප කප හිටපු රනිල් ලොල්ලසිංහ අල් ජසීරා එකෙන් ඇරගෙන කටෙන් බඩු පනින්නම😆 රටේ තරුණ තරුණියොන්ගෙ අනාගතේ විනාස කරපු ලමයි නැති ලොල්ලාසිංහ අපාගත වේවා.
Superb. Get Rajapaksha asap!!!!
AL Jazeera doesn't talk against Crimes of The Israel 🇮🇱 army in Gaza against innocent Muslim civilians which is thousand times more evil than the crimes commited by the Sri Lankan Army
Civil war was due to some Tamils who started violation and terrorism in Sri Lanka
7:53 Mr.Bean says they didnt have money for elections. But he doesnt say he had millions of money to give rajapaksa parliamentarians who had broken houses by protests.    17:21 Checkout 2022/07/13 Sri Lankan news channels. Rajapaksa regimes' most of the leading politicians reveal that how they appoint new president RW.  26:55 Yeah, he is doing that childish acting when he got cooked everytime.
RANIL one of the most corrupted politicians in the country. The savior of the Rajapaksa rogues. The politician was rejected by the majority of the Sri Lankans in all the elections not worth Al Jazeera wasting the previous time on a wasted traitor in the history of Sri Lanka
He is the batalanda murder
Al Jazeera interviewer ought to resort to more deciplined mannar so that the interviewee will get a fair time to explain the key points  raised and answers. It showed more interruptions in the dialogue. Anyway HE the former president provided reasonable answers to clear doubts and concerns of the people living outside of Sri Lanka who haven’t known or updated the ground situation in the country. Anyway It was a good forum and a quite appropriate one!
It's not an interview... It's a massacre being committed.
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a hero of our country.  Aren't you ashamed to talk about our countries without talking about the human rights violations in your countries?
Although I hate but like to wish that the war in Sri Lanka against a terrorist group didn't end in 2009 and still exist up to this date so then all of us can count deaths and casualties regardless of their ethnicity nor religion while giving more businesses to Arm Industry from both sides. And I request to anyone thinking that ending a long lasting war should have being super transparent with no violation and all in the battlefield for any reason should survive without any excuse, please come to your sense. For me the most important is that killing human in both sides and massive blood shed is stopped in 2009. I'm happy for the lives which are survived by that. Reality on ground is and was very different than in discussions in rooms..
Can you add sinhala subtitles
most of the answers from ranil Wickremesinghe are lies... truly respect from sri lankan people to the event presenter who is asking the question... we request need more interviews head to head with rajapakshe family members and previous government people.
I don’t think this guy is any fit for a debate. He only had a good answer that’s given when a Tamil ( majority of the questions came from folks from Tamil backgrounds) asked him on separate state for Tamils and he answered that well. There was war crime done by Tamil Tigers as well, it’s that some Tamils who flew the country to get political asylum painted a different picture on things about Sri Lanka. They like to play the victim card to gain asylum.
It seems like many of the commentators haven't actually watched Mehedi's interviews with people. In these interviews, he rarely lets the person he's speaking with finish their answer. Instead, he often interrupts, cutting them off before they can fully explain themselves. This results in him positioning himself as the one who is always right, leaving the interviewee seemingly unable to defend their point of view. He then takes credit for the conversation, making it look as though he has all the answers.  Before commenting negatively about Ranil, I would suggest that these commentators take the time to watch Mehedi's interviews. This way, they can better understand his interviewing style and the way he controls the conversation. It might provide them with a more balanced perspective and allow for a more informed discussion.
As a minority from Sri Lanka, this interview does justice for all the hate and crime done by the politicians and their mafia. Not a single Sri Lankan journalist has the spine to interview a politician in this way because everybody fears that they will end up like Richard De Soyza. Thank you Mehdi
Ranil,who is a human killer. He killed many young people in Sri Lanka
No limit for the stupidity, Ranil is a wolf in sheep's clothing...😮
රනිල් රජපක්ෂල ⁣ඔකුන් ලොක හොරැ
Did you see the theaf who rob the central bank of Sri Lanka, in this interview
Well done, Al Jazeera, Mehdi Hassan, Madura, Frances Harrison + team!!!  Even before the first question, Ranil Rajapakshe's nervousness was visible on his face!!!  Glad to see non-Sri Lankans questioning this corrupt politician who has been instrumental in creating havoc to our country and citizens!!!
What a joker RW! thank you AlJazeera thank you we needed this interview.
What about the thousands of Sinhalese people that were killed by the LTTE during the war? It was mass murder. Why doesn’t Tamil Diaspora talk about it?
This Interview Should translate to Sinhala and telecast in every single channel in sri lanka. 😅😅Sri lankan no 1 culprit. he killed so many youngsters. He is beyond evil. Well done Al jazeera. What an intense interview; cunning Ranil was left speechless. Respect to the journalist. These brutal political leaders must be exposed.
It is utterly revolting and profoundly disgraceful to witness Ranil Wickremesinghe’s feeble, evasive responses — particularly when confronted with the harrowing reality of innocent lives lost under his leadership.
This interview is very funny. The presenter not giving time to answer the questions he raised. He will be the best comedian presenter in the world.😂😂😂😂
i love mehdi hasan😂
True never be hidden 🫥 Ranil past work activity come behind him 😀😀😀
It’s a shame on Aljazeera channel to see how they handle their interviews.
This puppet robbed the central bank of Sri Lanka
Well done  al Jazeera ❤
This interviewer  isn't appropriate to interview such a person like RW
He shouldn't have attended the interview...😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂 we came with adult diaper,  So chair is save, cleaning team didn't have to do anything 😂😂😂,
Host is horrible, let the speaker answer first, dont try to push your narrative
This is the only way to respond  to these kind of arrogant media personalities... as a Sri Lankan I stand with ranil's approach 💯❤
This interview must telecast in all Sri Lankan local channels.
He is selected President not Elected  Selected by 134 members of parliament
Not for a single second did he put the country second. Every word he spoke was in defense of the nation, safeguarding its integrity and dignity. He answered as a true patriotic Sri Lankan, standing firm without allowing the country to be shamed on the global stage. A leader with unwavering commitment! Ranil Wickremesinghe 💚😊
Well done Al Jazeera! ❤
This msg  From 🇱🇰,In real life, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa are relatives. That's why they never investigate thefts. That happened during their rule.
Mehdi  he entered parliment illegally against the constitution he is a cunning fox power hungry mentally ill  killed more than 60000 youths.  Ranil is man know for creating riots people's peaceful protest was destroyed by his organized goons.
Mehedi hasan out ranil bowled him
Well done Al Jazeera❤, This person is a murderer
What a joker!?!
Not for a single second did he put the country second. Every word he spoke was in defense of the nation, safeguarding its integrity and dignity. He answered as a true patriotic Sri Lankan, standing firm without allowing the country to be shamed on the global stage. A leader with unwavering commitment! Ranil Wickremesinghe 💚
Hats off to Mehdi Hasan for showing the brutal nature of Ranil Wickramasinghe to the whole world.
Ranil says all lies  he is big thief. And killer. he is also prosiquter.
Ranil simply tried his Parliment Trick on International Media..
Not for a single second did he put the country second. Every word he spoke was in defense of the nation, safeguarding its integrity and dignity. He answered as a true patriotic Sri Lankan, standing firm without allowing the country to be shamed on the global stage. A leader with unwavering commitment! Ranil Wickremesinghe 💚

A perfect example of journalistic propaganda—where the drama unfolds according to a scripted narrative. Everyone involved knows the script, except for one person: the guest.
ටිකක් චමුදිත වගේ
Mr. Mahdi should have interviewed someone else other than this "CUNNING" president who destroyed whole of our country's economy along with Rajapaksa group. It is a shame Mr. Mahdi. He is a Master minder for all dirty politics in our country.
This man, Wickremasinghe, lied through his teeth about his gifted presidency, about protecting the Rajapakshas crooks, about enslaving the country to IMF and other foreign governments without getting the Rajapakshas to  return the billions stolen by them that impoverished our nation. He lies about Batalanda - read renowned investigative journalist book on Batalanda. This man is known as "The Butcher if Batalanda" and he was a minister in JR's government along with Ranasinghe Premadasa with whom he was hand in glove. A opportunist, self centered, revengeful horrid man.
Redde Rewila inna Kayyanayaka lontha pachayage napunsaka Jepponta redhi andhanne AL jazeera eken 😅😅😅
He is notorious as one of Sri Lanka's most skilled thieves, known for aiding corrupt individuals while exploiting and stealing from innocent people. His criminal legacy includes orchestrating the largest theft in the country's history. Beyond his thefts, he is also a ruthless murderer, responsible for the torture and deaths of thousands of young lives.🤮
We need more journalists like this in SL we got only few like this in Sirasa that’s it.
Bro literally got cooked!😂
AL Jazeera is always biased against Sri Lanka
Believe me, he is a true politician—he can lie without blinking an eye. He may appear clean and trustworthy, but he is one of the most corrupt politicians Sri Lanka has ever produced. Even today, he craves power; he is always hungry for it. He is the reason we are in this mess right now
Such an idiot. Was there in the politics for nearly 50 years but has no proper answer for any issues.
Medhi should do an interview with Israel 🇮🇱 leader Benjamin Nethanyahu 😂😂😂
I know that as a Sri Lankan, no politician can face such a program. Accordingly Proud of you Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe..
Ranil wickramasinghe is responsible for killing thousands of people in Batalanda in 1987-1989.
Yes he did had money to travel with many many politician.and west lost of poor people's tax money.
Srilankan joker
What an interview 😂
Hats off to Al Jazeera for bringing injustice to light. Hon. Ranil might have expected an interview similar to Hiru, but he was mistaken. He faced a real journalist.
Ranil Wickramasingha's biggest mistake in his life is to accept the invitation from Mehdi. 😂
Ganja zeera
තනිකර පට්ට හොරෙක් ,ලගදී ඇතුලට යන්න ඉන්නේ😂
This former Fake President couldn't answer any question by  journalist as shameless to Sri Lankan history and blady brutel Batalanda hechman!
The interviewer basically kneeled 😂😂 Ranil knows what he's doing. European propaganda won't work here. As a country we stand with RW 🇱🇰
Plz ask him 88 89. Batalandha.....😂😂😂
He used Batalandha to kill thousands of young people. In 1983 his uncle J.R. Jayawardhana did it not sinhala people.
අහන ඒවයි කියන ඒවයි තේරුම් නොගෙන ගොන් කතා කියන බයියෝ තාම ඉන්නවා. මේ ඉන්ටවීව් එකෙන් රනිල් නෙවෙයි ලංකාවම හැල්ලු උනා
Funny Grandpa 😂
He is the one who gained the most from that so-called protest, struggle, or "Aragalaya" in Sri Lankan terms; without it, he would never have been elected as the President of our country. In fact, instead of blaming those who protested, he should be grateful and praise them 🤣🤣
හොඳ වැඩේ ඔන්න සජබෙ රෙදි ඉල්ලේ 🤣🤣🤣
Every time a corrupt politician faces real questions, they turn into a comedian. Sri Lanka deserves serious leadership, not a circus. Gladly, the people made the right choice and defeated him in the election!
RANIL the Brutal killer, and a white color financial criminal trying to hide his real face from the world 🤮
Winsent was his gay parner according to rumors
First time Ranil has been cornered like this specially in the internationally level ... 38-39 his hand shows ..hope the nation will see this
Anchor better than chamuditha😂😅
Ranil is shaking. Shame on him. Ranil is fully upset.
Today the international community was able to find out who the cynic Ranil Wikramasinhe is.
ජාත්ත්‍යන්තර සබදතා තියන එකා  ගා ගත්ත නේද හත් පොලේ 😂
Who is this woman she never  paid no taxes or sat in her car over 2 nites  for petrol . this man completely changed future which was set on that afganistan and lebenon and got us on track so please u never had hardship this lady or you mahadi
Al-Jazeera is just ugly as cnn,just against basics and funded by people who have views like dem extremists.
Muta hena gahanne nehene
This is why we most Sri Lankans kicked him out. But still there are people who follow this old puppet as their leader.
Thanks for the ex.President Hon.Ranil wickramasingh very brave. Took the country turmoil time 2022.with boldness and guds.Single lion won the battle. We salute sir.
Superb answering 🤖 Lots of head agendas go wrong  🤌
Most dummest president I have ever seen
Thank you al jezeera ❤
😂😂😂😂😂 he is the man....
What set up by Al Jazeera.
My dream came true , this was the moment I was waiting for all  Life , well done Mahdi , you are right he is childish,  you made him a coward, he will go back to Colombo like a coward
ranil is the big thief he looted sri lanka with rajapaksha
Only the GMOA want him back - the rest of the country have had enough of him
Kayyanayaka Lapayage NPP wahallu tika form wela 😂😂😂🐂🐂🐂🐃🐃🐃
Respect Mr Ranil
What a loser RW
Is avoiding all questions about rajapakshas clearly and no doubt they all avoiding the Easter attack who a responsible are cut free
Mr president ranil 💯💯
He was chairing as the opposition leader for more than the years I'm OLD and always cringing for power, once he got the president seat not by people's majority votes, just by putting a deal under the table and he don't want to loose it. That's why he was smashing peaceful protestors with all his got. Just remember these protestors doesn't belong to one party or a organizations , they were common people who found the courage to take the national flag and comes to the street after so many years of hardship and broken promises. This is a CRIMINAL politically and financially. I'm glad that at-least someone has the courage to spoke about these things to his face.
Ranil didn't have mandate to rule the country.  He was elected by 134 members of parliaments from Rajapksha regime.
😂
IF I WAS RANIL' I'D KMS OUTTA EMBARRASSMENT
Boycott dem elite fake news channel and egomaniac mehedi Hassan.
The international version of Chamuditha—he throws out an allegation, and just when Ranil starts to respond, right at the perfect moment, he cuts him off with another one. Ranil was just passing the ball around. 18:15
You can see why he never got elected president, unsympathetic clown 🤡
MEHDI THANK YOU. YOU ASKED WHAT WE WANTED
He is a well experience and well-seasoned crook
A complete idiot. Cannot believe I was voting and supporting this guy in the past.
Utter embarrassment to Sri Lanka. Mr Bean showing his true colors
He is trying to glide from the questions by making funny stories. 😂 definitely he thought this also like talk with chamuditha 😂😂😂😂😂
manners! it is what that is lacking!
😂😂😂 Seeya... well done Al jazeera
We belive as a Sri Lankan, people like Ranil are just pass the time in the parliment for 7 decades... He destroyed his party... He is a failure. He thinks that still Sri Lankans are fools. Noway he can come to any position in the Sri Lankan Parliament. There plenty of good governors who are valage back ground but still they can do the job better than him. His qualification is English speaker. He is murder, he accepted in the parliament that they destroyed one of historically valued Library in Asia. 😊 So, we blame him to kill many innocent under his ruling parties
Mahinda Rajapaksa is a war hero and It's Ranil Wickremesinghe who engineered the internal downfall of the LTTE through the 2002 peace agreement
He did not change the chief of miliary during election but he changed IGP and Attorney General on his favour
Ranil Is A Smooth Criminal ...... 😅
Ranil rajapaksha redi left! 😂 huge shoutout to the journalist!
Ranil the FOX
You guys should see how this  dumb idiot spent money. Billions stolen by this man. This piece of shi😂t directly resposible for Batalanda torture center
👍👍👍👍👍
@SL_VLOG දැන් මොනවද කියන්නේ 😂😂😂
The most corrupt politician in the country has given direct orders and actively ordered the  of many young people in Sri Lankan history, particularly in what is known as the Batalanda case. He also robbed the Central Bank of Sri Lanka with Arjuna Mahendran, who is now living in Singapore. He is responsible for the current crisis in Sri Lanka and was never elected by the people's vote. Instead, other corrupt politicians in Parliament elected him as President to cover up their corruption.  For over 45 years, he has been in Parliament, serving multiple times as Prime Minister, and is the one who ruined our country. Even now, those corrupt politicians are creating chaos because Anura Kumara Dissanayake is trying to expose their corruption. However, Sri Lanka is now in safe hands, and the new President is doing his best to save our mother nation.  He may speak well and appear convincing, but don’t be fooled by his accent or smooth talk—behind his face, he is nothing but a jackal or a fox. He is corrupt and dangerous, hiding behind deception while ruining our country. He continues to hide behind the privileges of Parliament and the Executive Presidency, using them as a shield to escape accountability for his crimes.  He was behind the economic crisis that recently happened in Sri Lanka as a final attempt to become President before his end. His plan was to create the crisis and then present himself as the one who solved it, hoping to gain public support. He even used the gas cylinder symbol in his election campaign to remind people of the shortages they suffered. He threatened that if he was not elected as President, there would be another gas and fuel shortage.  However, wise Sri Lankans saw through his deception and voted for Anura Kumara Dissanayake for the better future of Sri Lanka.

This criminal ranil rajapaksha is a bed time story maker. Hes a murderer and killed so many innocent young youths in 80s and 90s. He must be in prison.
🤣 Are they all representing Tamil tiger terrorists?? Other than Ranil. These guys are representing the separatists. And crying about human rights. What about the human rights of the majority?
Alleged corruption and a genocide and ethic cleansing against Eelam tamil
Don't waste time talking to this pompous man, he is born with 'I', the only word in the English alphabet he understands
I think Rani was a best joker in the world
This just shows what a silly man Ranil is.
If Sri Lankan journalist had the nutts and came with recipts like Mehdi does here (not  being a Sri Lankan and to my knowledge having no affiliation to Sri Lanka) Sri Lanka would have been a much better place.. sadly a majority of Sri Lankans wont understand this interview.   This has always been Ranil.. full of ego and trying to mess with words and when everything fails teys to shift the blame on the person asking the questions... Finally someone can expose hom for the world to see..
ரணில் தாக்கப்பட்டார்
He is killer.Too much blood on his hand
Excellent  made Ranil look  like a fool
That's how you do it Well done al-jazeera 😂 ranil was hammered
@24.01 "is everything a game to you" Yes, exactly he(Ranil Wickramasinghe) was believing in game politics only. Not for the real solutions. He was failed in 95% aspect, as the president of Sri Lanka.
Interviewer just putting his agenda on screen without letting RW answer completely. Very unfair bias interview
Narcissist to another level!... thank you Al-Jazeera for showing this idiots birthday suit ❤
This is the way how ranil played with peoples  minds  And laughed and with silly jokes and never sorted issues in srilanka  Even in parliment
We call this crook "The Demon of Batalanda" 👹. Some may see him as a hero, but in reality, he's just another corrupt politician—one of the most cunning, if I may say so.  I’d like to point out that this interview seems rather one-sided. In my view, the LTTE was a terrorist organization, one of the most brutal in modern history, and was responsible for serious war crimes. Regardless of political affiliation, anyone who commits a crime should face punishment. While some argue that the trauma of war and events like Black July in 1983 (an incident that the LTTE initiated, before that there were tensions building) might explain certain actions, I believe that those who profess genuine care for the Tamil community yet idealize the LTTE are promoting a deeply biased, racially charged perspective. Finally,  I want to emphasize that the conflict is over and communities are coming together. It's important not to be swayed by those who exploit divisive rhetoric for political or personal gain.
He never won an election
Cant wait to see this being discuss on @SL_VLOG
Thanks for Al JAZEERA to bring him to this great interview, to be honest he's a real theaf
He is use his religion as a shield, what a shame Ranil 😡 I also respect this journalist, becase you have faced to biggest fox in Sri Lanka
Al  jazeera suprot  LTTE    Ranil 🎉🎉🎉
It looks like the man who is representing the TV channel is needs to improve himself. No chances were given to Mr Wickramasinghe answer questions. This is one side programm.
We love  ranil
Please ask the residents of the country at that time who underwent  all the hardships. We are more than happy with the decisions taken to bring back normalcy to the country. It's a shame on a pack of individuals who dont know anything  besides hearsay to discredit him. You have preconceived ideas of everything  and everyone before the interview, so why even have this monologue as it was not a dialogue.
This must be telecast in Sri Lanka in Sinhala translation.
I’m not a fan of Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe or any of the Rajapaksas—in fact, I participated in the protests. But I think it would be better if Al Jazeera stopped provoking people. Don’t try to create news!  You can criticize all our leaders and the mistakes that have been made in the country, but despite our different religions and ethnicities, we are living in a safe country because of them.  Yes, we may not have all the luxuries, but we are safe!  Stop provoking people!
Respect….Journalist but sad for SL
Mahinda Rajapaksha ❤️‍🔥🔥 & Ranil wickramasingha my heros 🤍
Adoo Ranilta medaa redde reuna😅😅😂😂
Good expose of Ranil. He was in power from that started civil war by burning Jaffna Library in 1982.His uncle was then president, then he was in power when killing spree happened in South. Then he was in opposition showing false face against Rajapakses but Rajapakses gifted him Presidency. One point missed his appointed Central Bank Governor fled after did scam with him.He was figure head of protectors of corrupt politicians. He is now symbol of failed corrupt politicians and who responsible for bankruptcy. He didn't do anything about recovery of the country it was present governor and officials. Welldone Al Jazeera👏👏👏
Look like Mr bean, sorry it's an insulting to the Mr Bean
Thanks to Aljazeera ❤ good questions😂
Sri Lankans don't need AL Jazeera and it's journalists to solve our national problems
Thank you Al Jazeera and Mehdi to show his actual face in to public stage.
We apologize as Sri Lankans for this old croney who needs to retail his relevance because he cannot understand why he is rejected not once  seven times! When you are a narcissist, it is impossible to see yourself for who you are. Ageing gracefully requires learning when to retire and stay quiet. This is an embarrassment!
Here the journalist asked  what you are watching on Netflix. Thanks for questioning
He is the one most dangerous and cunning fox dealing with Rajapaksha family, he's a number one currpted and cheap polititan same like his uncle late president J. R. Jaywardane, also late president R. Premadasa and all the former presidents who were in powered stated dealing with underworld for their loang term plans
😂😂 funny journalist .. he asking question and answering .😂😂😂.
Bro cooked so bad🤣🤣
It is a shame for Sri Lanka…. Everyone is smiling…. He becomes a joker
This interview completely changes my view of Mr Wickremesinghe. I thought he was a professional politician but seems to be so childish and unprofessional.

Aljazeera must stop 🛑 interview this criminal! He must be behind bars!
As Sri Lankans we need to thanks❤ Aljazeera because of straight forward Questions.  RWickramasinghe killed nearly 60,000 people in 1989 not only killed  tortured them like animals."Batalanda" That apartments' neighbour was Young and Sport Minister in that Government This man Ranil Wickramasinghe.He is a more than a murderer He is a Lunatic.All Sri Lankans people need to watch this episode because Some of people still thinks RW is good more than Rajapakshe,they can't understand these are both sides of a same corrupted coin.His party UNP is planning to give a parliament seat which they won with national list.Sri Lankans need to watch this.
How shameful. Criminal, liar, traitor
he can’t win never ever  people vote because he is human killer and central bank robber🤮🤮 His life is made of lies
Thanks for exposing this monster who ruined our country.
He killed many university students in 1988/1989.
Interview  went with  highest level nevertheless    mehdi  hassen   should  have  given  little  more  breathing space  to answer.  That's  was  lacking  in this  Interview.
Thank you al jaseera❤
35:28 Batalanda commission report is clearly mention about Ranil wickremesinghe is a killer... every sri lankan pepoles are know that.
Ranil was a killer  our country economi he divaid my country money with his friend
මූ හිතාගෙන එන්න ඇති talk with chamuditha  වගේ කියලා , 😅😂

As a Sri Lankan, this is kind of happiest day😂😂😂. Ranil is very currupted politicians in Sri Lankan history, second only to Rajapaksha 😂😂😂.
Very dangerous men in srilanka mr ranil & rajaoaksha family members.very good questions.  He can't do without scam
Good replies Ex president Mr Ranil. Tamil Diaspora given the script to Mehdi hasan.
If he had been in power a little longer, Sri Lanka would have been sold to India.
Thank you All Jazeera ❤❤❤
Remember,Rw is not the helazky
33:57 Totally wrong! Nirj Deva has said no one arrested for burning Wikramasinghe's hous. WRONG!!! They have been arbitrarily detained.
It’s easy to understand
His english is not even englishing 😂😂
හරියට mr bean 😂😂  වෙන කවුරුත් නෙවෙයි සොම්බියා 76 වසරක කාලකන්නියා
This f Ranil was a butcher and killed innocent youth in Batalanda torture camp in 88 and 89. This interview must be telecast in local TV channels with the sinhala subtitles. It is a responsibility of the NPP government.
He is old but has done nothing to Srilanka
Mr Ranil  ❤❤❤❤👍
රනිල් මහ බැංකුවට ශොට් එක දීපු එකස්😂😂
He doesn't have money for election.worest Politician in Sri Lanka.This man destroyed our valuable country.Didnt do  anything that he told. He get our country debt .Hate him seriously.He have done "Batalanda".murder cases. He controled and knew young people arising.his government killed them.  Mr.fomer president Ranil Wickramasinghe you can  tell lies in Sinhala to our innecent people but you cannot tell lies in English .finally We love our soilders   specially Feild Marshel Fonseka  General Shavendra Silva they protect us . We did war agaist terrists not for tamil people. Thank you Aljazeera.
Both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa are great Leaders of South Asian modern politics! We as Sri Lankans are proud of our great leaders although they have their own shortcomings
First time a foreigner pronounced ranils last name perfectly
As a Sri Lankan i give shout-out to mehdi hasan. Rani Wickramasingha is a puppet of rajapaksha
Ape සීයා😂😂😂😂😂 පව් අප්පා.....😂😂😂😂
This guy didnt take srilanka out of crisis.

ලප කුමාරගේ නූගත් බයියෝ ටික ෆෝම්වෙලා ගොං ආතල් දිලා නේද මෙතනත් 🤣
This man killed many youth and began his politics
😂😂
First time he faced a real journalist, got screwed
This is a bafoon. Wasting precious time of other people
Giant single elephant ❤️❤️
Al jazeera, you had better   name this interview as"Sri Lanka war crimes" and invite to former president Mahinda Rajapaksha. During the war Ranil was against the war crime clearly.
පුලුවන්නම් ඕකට අනුරව ගෙන්නන්ඩකෝ. හැබැයි සිංහලෙන් ප්‍රශ්න අහන්ඩ. ඉංග්‍රීසියෙන් ඇහැව්වොත් ඌට බඩයයි
This is the man who killed innocent youngsters in 1980s
This srilankan former president is very talkative and well educated in London law college
What an interview. Thank you Al Jazeera
This guy doesn't know to present to real medias because they handle media and owners were friends of them. If any media goes against they used their power.
My salutation to Hon Ranil' Wicramasingha to restore democracy in Sri Lanka 🌈 in 2022
This journalist should really have patience and let RW complete his speech. He never lets Ranil to complete any of his answers. Very unprofessional 👎
This is the main culprit
Mehdi is interrupting with questions before RANIL completes his answers. Mehdi is level headed and spoiling the flow of the interview. He must let invitees answer questions instead.
නාකී හම්පඩ ලොන්තයාගේ රෙදි නැ😅😅😅
Who sent this guy to such a big stage. He is a shame to all of us, Sri Lankans.
super hosting this is how sri lanka journalist should ask questions.
He came third 😂😂😂😂😂
Hats off to Al Jazeera and Mehdi for holding this culprit accountable and asking the real questions. He probably came to the interview thinking it'll be the same as Sri Lankan media 😅
I am thanking Medhi for exposing Ranil
Well planned drama. 😂😂😂😂
Now al fakira will tell us india is guilty inthus case 😂😂
Why is Al Jazeera only broadcasting a portion of the 2-hour discussion? As Sri Lankans, we are saddened by it. Be more moderate. Qatari Princess, look at this injustice. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Al jazeera always liberal bias Tv network.
සීයා තමා හොදටම කලේ🤩
Living Legend of South Asian Modern politics Ranil Wickremesinghe 🌎🌎🌎🌾🌾🌾🐘🐘🐘🌳🌳🌳💚💚💚💙💙💙🧠🧠🧠
Ranil is biggest jocker for ever🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
ඔකා....පර රාජපක්ෂලා ට කඩේ යන එකා
බටලන්දෙ වධකයා 😠
When you watch the interview the hand of the LTTE diaspora in pumping the hyperactive interviewer is obvious. The audience is full of them as well.
Thank you for this Mehdi  Get Namal Rajapaksa on next
Rajapaksha took all of our wealth and the countries wealth also, now people have nothing 😩
He protects Rajapaksa family. This person is a curse for Sri Lanka. Thank you, Aljazeera.
මහත්මා දෙශපාලනයේ ලැට් කට...

🐘💚
President Ranil! Can't thank you enough for saving our country!
Batalande😅
Let him talk
Global Asiatic Leader of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe 🐘🐘🐘🌾🌾🌾🌏🌏🌏🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🌈🌈🌈🌄🌄🌄🌌🌌🌌
Most corrupted politician ever produced
President Ranil Wickramasinghe ,Best ever president we had❤❤❤❤
This is the first time I've  seen him mess up like this. Excellent questioning by the journalist.
Ranil 😂
This is another thief who destroyed Sri Lanka 🥴
unfortunatewhite is not shown in srilanka media
Huge respect for this journalist. Love from 🇱🇰
He needs to let other people talk in the show. Only he is saying things is not an interview.
He's not sri lankan,,what a disgrace 🥲
Interviewer got exactly what he wanted out of this interview!  Ranil’s conniving, deceitful and corrupt to the core character was laid bare for all to see!  Bravo
He is a fox dirty politician
He has lot of corruption deal with rajapaksha..
Allow ranil to complete his answer.Dont try to be too smart.fool
Ranil is a murderous joker.
Silm❤❤❤❤
Robber😂😂
b b b b omg he became rajitha’s son , well done Al Jaseera , kudos to you
Mehdi hasan when did he join Al Jazeera?
Ranil's political Mandate was  to put the economy  back in to track  by looting the central bank E.P.F contributions of poor citizens, and stealing  billions of the taxpayers money on the 20- 09- 2024 just one day before the presidental election for promoting his election champaign. Shame on you Ranil . Face the world and defend yourself. 😂😂😂
Highly corrupted person. Master of bank corrupt. Rajapaksa and Ranil were not two. They were one. They are friend. He protected murder of a journalist called Lasantha. He says right, he is grandfather's age. That's why people reject. Indians like him.
For the first time, Ranil met a real journalist
Busted 😂
Great Leader of South Asia Ranil Wickremesinghe! The Living Legend💙💙💙💚💚💚🩵🩵🩵🌈🌈🌈🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰🌌🌌🌌🧠🧠🧠🐘🐘🐘🦣🦣🦣
Ranil is a murderer and criminal. He mislead all the civilians and robbed the country with his parliament gangstas.. he must be in the prison for life time.
Can’t believe that there are people in Sri lanka that still support this war criminal
Ferrari grand paa....you are the destroyer of sri lanka🤬🤬🤬
@Mehedi 🤝
Entire thing in a nutshell   Mehdi : There is evidence that supports you are corrupt.  Ranil : yo mama corrupt lmao gottem gg ez  Mehdi : Sir this is serious.  Ranil : YO MAMA SERIOUS!
love u Al Jazeera 😚😚😚😚
On behalf of all Sri Lankans I Thank Al Jazeera 🙏 for exposing this super duper corrupted politician to the world ❤
Ranil ,go to heal
❤❤❤gazeera
Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crises? COVID, JVP, LTTE
A cunning fox.
He did NOT answer a single question he was asked and that's RanilRajapaksa for you! What a Liar   Liar...
Ranil is best car driver in the world He have ferrari car licence 😂
Al jazeera can learn from this president about manners
The interviewer in Al Jazeera seems in a hurry to go to the toilet. Not allowing Ranil to complete his sentence even
Medhi is more capable person than Ranil in handling arguments
He doesn't  remember  what happened  2 years  ago.His analogies   are so ignorant. this is how sri lankan  politicians  deal  with truth He also think he can  deal  with international  media
mu budda daramayath paawala denawa.  Ranil Wikkramasinghe one of the biggest killers in history of sri lanka
Hats off to the news channel for the interview. Expose'! The cunning old fox was right royally  outwitted by the brilliant journalist. WoW...In this country, no journalist has the guts to question these  politicians who destroyed our beloved Motherland.  Bravo.
නාකී හම්පඩ ලොන්ත ලොල්ලා😂😂😂
Ex Scum of sri lanka, he was the reason for curption and destruction .he was not entitled to call presidents. He is just a puppet controllered by rajapassa, and other corrupted political partys. If there is votes of people,  he will never be ex president of our country. He destroy 23 milian of people  and next generation of the nation hope.
Nobody trusts this man. Look at his criminal record since 1977. He is implicated in almost every murder done by the government during 88-89 era. He used underworld figures to kill politicians and cling onto power. He robbed the central bank. He allowed his ministers to rob government money. He is a man responsible for the Easter bombings. The worst politician in Sri Lanka. That’s why people won’t vote him to power. A curse to a country like Sri Lanka.
Volkswagen,free wi-Fi,free beslat,free deth,free gay jok sri lanka prasident😂😂😂
This should telecasted in National Television of Sri Lanka with Subtitles included.I hope the new govt.of Anura Kumara Dissanayake has guts to do it.
What a pathetic performance by an ex President/ Prime minister in front of an international audience.
For the sake of my knowledge i would like to know this head to head with talk with former president Of srilanka mr ranil wickramasinghe where took place means (which country)?
savior of Currupted rajapakshas  ..
Seems he was shaken when the Ranil Rajapaksa saga got exposed.
Super interview Aljazeera. Ranil is one of the most corrupt politicians in SL. Well done Aljazeera
Good bye Ranil!! Out of sight, out of mind!!!
started getting roast hardly with this we can see from his face 😅
He’s also thieves group
Waste of the time with this Bean (sri Lankan Mr Bean)
Please punished full interview..there is only harf..
Well done Al Jazeera. True journalism. Respect  Journalism.
Actual  truth is this fellow always safeguarded That culprit rajapakses.😊
Butcher of Gujrat are sheltering Butcher of Bangladesh,  why international communities aren't taking actions against the India  ?
Ranil is one of worst president in srilanka 🤧🤧
Thank you for asking questions like that we Sri Lankans are very happy about it
Ranil is legende
Tamil Diaspora at its best to discredit a Sinhalese because there was no one suitable to come closer in their community even to polish his shoes. Stay in London boys and girls. Srilanka is not for you guys. That’s for better people. It was RW who did most to the Tamils and was the one who got rejected by the majority Sinhalese as a pro Tamil.
Do not drag Buddhism into this please.Such visions are beyond the understanding of these kinda politicians.
Well done mehdi hasan👍👍👍🇱🇰🇫🇷
He wants to runaway. 😅😅
A mere puppet of the Rajapaksha regime.😂😂
Well done Al Jazeera.
Why roasting one person ? Now all lives peacefully as one nation .one country ❤️   Any hidden intentions ! Just curious.
He is so child, comparing himself to Ghandi
Lol 😂
What a joker 🃏
Mehdi Hassan ❤❤❤
Short period of our Life why we are fighting? This earth belongs all of uS 🙏 know ?  i   am deeply saddened by the damage to the life and property of civil people. I m happy to peace agreement and sorry to break peace agreement that benefit to All us our friends relations.   different people make this world  nice know? Al Jazeera team panel audience.   this question again getting repaining of our heart ❤️  from  wars Retouching in our heart. what are the benefits you have received.  personly  I offered my loving my lovin Al Jazeera team, panel my love in audience. if All ask this question other side. 1 missing our people how to stop this kind of bad experience and how to share love, Care, protect know?  2. politics job is to sale  policys , sad , protect, ECT.  People are blind they are hoping new beta future why other politics not thoughts above people.
what a biased show, one man against dozens of big foul mouths..
Pa ka ya
Sri Lankan Attorny general is the most corrupted officer of the whole world if not entire universe
Well done hasan ❤
Redi ne Muge. Ada redi gelawuna. Hora
You lost, despite your long experience, because, like you did hear, you skipped to learn the pulse of people. If you are adamant and stubborn, people kept rejecting for that. You joined and supported, the rejected party. If you had one simple quality that is listening and understanding peoples interest you could have maximum terms of a president. Attorney general was given undue orders.  Journalists have looked in to everything in detail.
Ranil Great Leader❤❤❤❤❤❤
I HOPE THIS INTERVIEWER WOULD INTERVIEW PRESIDENT ANURA KUMARA DISSANAYAKE ABOUT THE REIGN OF TERROR IN 1988/89 WHEN THEY KILLED MANY INNOCENT INTELLECTUALS LIKE PROF STANLEY WIJESUNDERE, DR GLADYS JAYEWARDENE (BECAUSE AS CHAIRMAN OF PHARMACEUTICALS CORP SHE APPROVED IMPORT OF INDIAN MEDICINES) , AND THE MANY TEA  PLANTERS, JUST BECAUSE THEY WORKED FOR MULTINATIONALS, And MANY OTHER INNOCENT CIVILIANS.   BOTH BATALANDA AND THESE JVP MASS MURDERS TOOK PLACE IN THAT REIGN OF TERROR.  THE JVP PLAYED HAVOC DURING THIS TIME, THE GOVT HAD TO USE FORCE TO CRUSH THEM.  The present President was an active member of the JVP during this time  JVP, since 1970, jeopardised all Government's programmes.  JVP were also part of the Rajapaksa regime since 2004 to 2019.  This interviewer spoke about the Rajapaksas wrongs and accused Ranil of being their friend.   SO AL JAZEERA, PLS INTERVIEW PRESIDENT ANURA KUMARA DISSANAYAKE ALSO
Ranil is a mad man 😂
He is frist time meeting real Journalist, Respect @AlJazeera 💥
Mehdi on fire. He just minced Ranil. Too bad Ranil could not answer his questions, tactfully under the pretext of being childish he didn't answer the crucial ones. By being unable to answer he answered everything we needed to know.
Really. In the pure sense of the word  is idot
When he was elected there was no time to finnd criminals and punish them.Yet he saved the country from economic crisis.he spent most of his political career as the main opposition to Rajapaksha .He never support the war and never used racial issues in his politics.he always had a fooish laugh on his face,even at a funeral. He is not popular because he always choose the narrowe gate to enter. Im a catholic too.
Ranil is the Mr.Bean of Sri Lanka 😂
Batalanda was before my time. But elders say Ranil was the mind behind Batalanda, which took 1000s of young lives in late 80s. Thats just one crime of ranil. Thank you for confronting him  !! As a Sri Lankan who loves the mother land, I truly appreciate this  effort
Well Done Al-Jazeera..
FULL SHOW EKA BALAHALLA..MOO NAANAWA
Ayiyo!!!! Mr. Bean. You are the only one president selected by rough Rajapakshe to protect them. Not by people of the country. You got no mandate at all.  You people burnt the the most valuable library in Jaffna the north of the country. You create the communal riots in Srilanka 1983. You start killing university students in 1989. Still students missing, what happened nobody knows.  Now we have a new government. They would bring light to our country for sure.
Ranil! Legendary Tusk ❤️👑
Why doesn't anyone talk about grave atrocities done by LTTE? It's unbelievable!!!
This man saved corrupted Rajapaksha's
Please translate this interview in sinhalese and let everybody in srilanka to express their thoughts and ideas about this criminal Ranil Rajapaksha.
Go jail ranil   Hora nakiya
Number dictator in Srilankan history 😊
Rajapaksha family and Ranil were responsible for the crisis in Sri Lanka.  Now everything exposes.  They were very currupted,  very brutal,  spent people's tax money irresponsible manner
Mr ranil thinks problems related to his Colombo clan are the problems of every Srilankan.
Ranil fox is roasted
Siri-lanka majority of the peoples are Actully Surprised why this man still not taken him to Custody?Heis the Founderof very famous Batalande Concentration Camp HisUncle jawardene and him areAncestress and treacherous theCountry duringColonia period,and also Mainly Publish by the Siri-lakken News papers, The is no differnt himself and Chlie Pinochet nNatheniyhu
Once you present a question. Please allow that person to present his answer. Don't speak over him. It shows absolute disregard. Why have the interview at all?
😂😂😂I have never seen Ranil getting humiliated as this 😂😂😂
Such a ball-pass guy escaping valid questions. To the last question, what Mehdi asked, Sri Lanka will never again vote for him. He is just another power power-hungry oldie. Nothing else matters to him other than power.
Waste of time Al Jazeera. Unwanted attention
Unp,Slfa,Slpa (Ranil,sajith,Mahinda)these are the destroyers Country sri lanka . They didnt think regarding theirs people.They did everything for theirs familiar people.These corruption politicians should not stand in this country
😂😂
This guy is a mass murderer. He wiped out brightest young generation in the past.
❤ A great man of an era.. The Tamil diaspora seems to be handled well in this discussion. It is well understood that the international diaspora has made a huge contribution to bringing the new NPP party formed based on the JVP to power. It is now clear that this current government will give 13+ to the North... We would like to see the current President Anura Kumara being brought to such a debate and how he answers such questions... Al Jazeera, you will never see Ranil Wickremesinghe and argue with him about reality, no one can surpass him in your argument. Many things that you do not know have happened fairly in my country. In this discussion, you are like blind people touching the surface... 😇
Ranil Wickramasingha ❤
His  Nick name has been Mr.Clean though, end being Mr. Corrupt.
Best Journalist
Well done Al jassera
Get the Rajapaksas + Opp leader Sajith & current President Anura . they are the true culprits .
This man is a Sri Lankan political criminal... He joined forces with the Rajapaksa gang and committed many murders in Sri Lanka using government paramilitary forces... He maintained underworld gangs in Sri Lanka and provided political asylum.
19:15 Ranil rajapaksha not a buddhist, he is absolutely  Jainism.
Fox got cornered .😂
The Sinhala ppl should watch and understand this, this is the stupid corrupt politicians
In shortly  neither  this interview  nor this reporter  impartial . Purposely  they do Diaspora agenda .
🤡 Cooked..!!
As usual Wickremesinghe very clever to slip with answer and his main idea is protect corrupt and culprits to stay in power. now its very clear currently coming in up cope and other investigates how the funds are abused
RW would have gone under the chair. It is an utter embarrassment that he cannot handle such an interview.. RW has been cornered. It is sad and shocking  that a former president of our country behaves in this manner. disgraceful. Not a good reflection on Sri Lankans...and from his constant evading answers it shows that he is guilty on exact what he is been accused of and that is corruption and supporting the Rajas and their cronies. I do agree with Mr Deva that it should be Rajapaksas been questioned here and NOT RW as is their names who are linked to all these atrocities
This guy always likes this. He wants journalists to ask questions about what he wants. Not journalist's questions. Same disgusting attitude he shows. Overestimated by himself and his little number of people.
Looking at the Lankans’ comments here, I didn’t knew Ranil was so unpopular in Sri Lanka.
Finally someone did an interview about this country im proud 👏
As a citizen that lived through  much of the issues brought up here, I agree with much of the questioning and bringing RW and his buddies to account. But one thing we cannot agree is the exagerated unfair focus on the actions of the Srilankan military side in the final hours of ending a war, when it was  LTTE militants that were using much civilians as sheilds throughout the war. It was the SL forces that were held responsible to fight fairly and they did for 20 years, while the LTTE carried out suicide bombings in civilian locations, mass murderers of villages, monasteries, guerilla warfare and using child soldiers. It was Tamils living in the West that was taxed and funded a terrorist course.  The same terrorist group that murdered much of the Tamil leaders of SL who opposed LTTE or supported SL gov. That bias still exists in UK media. We should be greatful that SL army ended the war.
Can you invite Namal Rajapaksa next time. It'll be a blockbuster!
The most defeated politician in Sri Lankan history and the one who brought the country to the abyss. He should be sentenced to prison.🤮
Well done Mehdi  Hassan from Sri Lanka
Nice his true character brought out , not the sl fake media made 😂😂😂
Mehdi Hasan got fired from US tv channel MSNBC for being a partisan hack
Ranil will never face international media again 😂
He is so used to get interviews from paid actors 😂 he is just a clown when you ask right questions. Some pople in sri lanka really believe he got sri lanka out of the crisis. Peak ignorance😅
Well sadly the journalist here is biased. Just like a Sri Lankan journalist we all know who shoots out the questions and gives all the answers even before the visitor is allowed to answer.  How ever no matter what the EU, UN or any other organization have to say, we believe that our country was take over by Mr. Wickramasinghe at the right time. He did not want to hold his position for years but he definitely did what he had to do.  Unfortunately we are at stake again with the new government! Such a sad situation in Sri Lanka.
Mr ranil didn't get up country from economic crisis.  He only extended previous agenda and rescued rajapakshas from civilians.
This man is not allowing Ranil Wickramasinghe to speak...what kind of an interview is this? The interviewer is totally one sided! He seemed to have decided that Ranil should be ridiculed solely because he was appointed by Rajapakshas. He fails to say that the Opposition Leader refused to accept the Premiership during the crisis in 2022. The other significant issue is the Good Friday Bomb Attacks in 2018 which was caused to get rid of Ranil's government by the Rajapakshas. That was the 3rd attempt after they failed in toppling his government. The LTTErs caused many sucide attacks and many killings which this interviewer refused to touch on. The killings of over 14000 Tamils was done during Rajapakshas period. All these damning questions should be posed to the Rajapakshas under whose watch the LTTE was defeated. Attacking a man, whose government was toppled by the Rajapakshas and later whose help was sought by the same Rajapakshas, is ludicrous!
If these questions were asked inside Sri Lanka then this journalist will be a dead man walking.
At last Ranil got a true journalist 🤭😂😂
අදනං නෝන්ඩි වුනා නන්නත්තාරවෙන්න....මොන තරම් පව් කරපු මිනිහෙක්ද...
This guy is only given credit by his supporters, but according to them, he's not responsible for the stagnant economy, which declined after 2017, and then the eventual bankruptcy.
Our great president 💖
සීයා නානවා හොඳ එකේන් 😂😂
Al jazeera well done
Very bad man ranil wikramasinga
Ramadan BBQ from srilanka 😂😂
Always telling lies
අඩො චමුදිත මෙක බලලා ඉගෙනගනින් පරයා
Disgraceful to say the least. Misinterpreting facts and hiding behind arrogance will speak of his caliber. The citizens have dumped him to the dustbin for not being accountable but protecting the goons.
This is a 2 hours interview. Why you guys put only 49 minutes 😂
Thank you Al Jazeera. ❤ This is the biggest killer in Sri Lankan history. Rajapaksha and Wickramasinghe are same regime.  They killed people and evidence too. And they destroyed our dreams, future. Luckily now we have hope.
Firstly Sri Lanka never had a civil war - we had a terrorist problem - this needs to be corrected.
Come on man ! This is one of the main culprits for our country s bankruptcy  😂  Idiots !
This is a horrible 'hit job' style interview. From the start, interviewer adopted an aggressive/hostile/accusatory tone and denied/prevented  RW from answering meaningfully by shouting him down and peppering with series personal attacks.  I personally do not like RW.  But RW was ambushed here by a tamil activists attempt at reviving/resuscitating/inciting the issue of tamil eelam - resolved in 2009. As a country we should look to the future for reconciliation/remedying our problems and developing together. But this type of clear attempt at reopening old wounds to revisit a painful past to rekindle anger, instigate seperatist/nationalistic sentiments is not the solution or helpful. This was a horrible piece of journalism. mehdihasan provided a platform to mobilize discord. So FU mehdihasan.
I think this is the guy who burned Jaffna Library and who started the war aganist Tamils in Sri lanka, You made Ranil a joker. clear and authentic questions Well done
he is a great leader who saved our country sevral times. Unfortunate srilankan always chooses the lier or joker
Excellent questioning and excellent explanation of the srilanka corruptions and criminal crisis. Ranil Rajapaksha regime is guilty of every single criminal activity and the bankruptcy claimed at the end of his presidential period.  Now Ranil is desperately trying to disturb The NPP GOVERNMENT AND COME BACK TO POWER TO RUIN OUR BEAUTIFUL MOTHERLAND.
මේ වගේ සිංහලෙන් අහන්න එකෙක් නෑනෙ ලංකාවේ
Unliked this video because asked questions from bank robber
Al Jazeera is Not Come to Save Us in That Time. But Ranil Wikramasinha Save Us 💪
Were are all the singles in the audience 😮
Ranil Fox caught to a great journalist. He is not giving proper answer. Same thing Ranil Fox did to DW News.
He is one of the person who has contributed to the bankruptcy of one of the best  resourceful country in the world.
Joker in the Sri Lanka  Ranil
This is an Ambush made by Aljazeera ....
Shocking
He is Mr.crises marker in srilanka.still he is making derty plane to becomer power still now also last election he did not get even single seet but still trying for derty politics
His attitude throughout this interview is the same attitude he has for governance. He does not care about people. He only cares about lining his and his friends' pockets. He is one of the most corrupt politicians in the country (as much as the Rajapaksha family). He should not be allowed to talk in public as he brings shame to our country. It is a shame that he got as much as 17% of the vote in the election
Thank God we chased away this double faced fox Ranil the old educated donkey 😂 sri lanka is doing well with out him and Mahinda regime. No no we dont need ur media biased biews. We are super active on a new path.
Politicians can be put in to two categories. Not Left and Right Politics, but Politicians that work for the interests of the oligarchy and those that work for the interests of the People.  Biden, Trump, Sunak, Stammer and RW/MR can be placed in the former, while Bernie Sanders, AOC, Jeremy Corbyn and AKD can be placed in the latter group.  If you view political systems in this manner you can easily identify the Aholes from the Heroes.  RW did split the LTTE in to two,  which lead to their collapse. He stepped in twice to resurrect a collapsed Sri Lankan economy (Once under Chandrika Bandaranayake), but he was and has always has been the oligarchs politician.
දූශිත දේශපාලනය අවසන්.....😂😂🤟🤟🤟රනිල්
There is a main reason for poor country sri lanka 😢, Yes, he is. And his mango friend mahinda rajapaksha's family
Why did he choose to accept this interview.....😂
2 retards fighting
Murder ranil shameless animal
If you're interested in understanding what happened during the war in Sri Lanka, here's a brief overview: The LTTE, widely regarded as a terrorist organization, attacked Sri Lankan civilians. In response, the government’s army conducted rescue operations. Essentially, the conflict was not driven by cultural or nationalistic differences. Today, the same communities affected by the war continue to live on the same lands, and there is currently no ongoing crisis.
He forgot to mention what led to people burning houses of Mahinda Rajapakshas supporters. He forgot many things.
Ranil is the biggest protector of the Rajapaksa.  Batalanda torturer who gave pleasure to the Rajapaksas by embezzling the country's money for the past 2 years.  He must be arrested and put in jail.
What is the purpose of interview with this guy?
He did not have no money to only to hold election  But he has money for all other unnecessary events ?
Ranil is a puppet of Rajapakses!!
Sri lanka Mr Bean.😂
Batalanda killer
එක තත්පරයක්වත් ඔහු රට දෙවනුව තැබුවේ නැත. ඔහු කතා කළ සෑම වචනයක්ම ජාතිය ආරක්ෂා කිරීම සඳහා වූ අතර, එහි අඛණ්ඩතාව සහ ගෞරවය ආරක්ෂා කළේය. ඔහු සැබෑ දේශප්‍රේමී ශ්‍රී ලාංකිකයෙකු ලෙස පිළිතුරු දුන් අතර, ගෝලීය වේදිකාවේ රට ලැජ්ජාවට පත් වීමට ඉඩ නොදී ස්ථිරව සිටියේය. නොසැලෙන කැපවීමක් ඇති නායකයෙක්! රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ 💚
රනිල් රාජපක්ශ ආය ගේන්න රනිල් ගේ ඩොක්ටලා සෙට් එකක් මාර ගේමක් දෙනවා.😆😆..මේ වගේ මිනීමරුවෙක් ආය ගේන්න මිනිස්සුන්ට පිස්සු නැ😆
Well done al Jazeera journalist
weaponised well practiced rhetoric and tired hypocrisy, together with lack of respect and integrity...bad interviewing Mehdi
Thank you very much for excellent questioning the real culprit in srilanka political crimes and disappearances of innocent youth, Journalists and other citizens for their political agendas. This guy should be banned from his politics  for good.
there are two part of interview, one : corruption of RR , two : flavors to LTTE (terrorist group )
Yes there were a civil war for more than 26 years. And nearly killed 100,000. But why you only care about the tamil people whom died. Why not sinhalese who lost their lives??? Why you only highlight the tamils ?? If you are truly concerned about human rights, you should go with both races. Don’t create a drama by putting this man into a situation where you expect him to give an answer you like. We clearly know who this Ranil Wickramasinghe is. Anyway thanks to this journalist. But please consider both Sinhalese and tamils when you are talking about human rights.
5:21 I think this villain has *selective amnesia* because  he only says about what happened after  11:00am on 09th of May in 2022 but,,the protest started 15th of March at galleface(gota go gama) so not only the whole Sri lankans but also international media knows ,,the protesters which were in galleface were introduced as "peace full protesters ",,,,,So no one didn't took even a singel stone for attack anyone,,and that was also a manjor reason for the whole srilankans to standing with them against the corrupted politicians,,,but 9am on that day the thugs of rajapaksa s' attacked to those peaceful protesters,,,,,the whole world was saw how those thugs attacked to innocent peaceful peoples ,,after that incident  all of sri lankans were triggered thats what happened before 11:00am at that day...
Ranil was murderer in 80s. He killed innocent young people in SL for them powers in politics. 😢
Interviewing person is very bias
Ranil is a pure evil. He also responsible person for killing young generation of early 90. He is a political power hunger and he will do whatever to grab power. He doesn't have heart or conscience. මිනීමරු රනිල් වික්‍රමසිංහ. ධාතු සුනඛයා. මිනිසුන් බිලිගන්නා ලේ මාපිලා
He has newer won a single election on his own  So much he is popular
Ranil wickramasingha ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Well said Dr Deva Adithiya.
As a Sri Lankan, this interview healed me!
The interviewer is only good at arguing and asking questions. He does not know what actually happened in Sri Lanka. At least he had the guts to face the interview, unlike other politicians in Sri Lanka. Respect to Ranil Wickremesinghe.❤🧡💛💚
This idiot dictator is lying, he was a total dictator, purposely he cancelled the 2023 election.
දන් බැ බබා රනිල්.🤣🤣....87 89 කැම්පස් ලමයින්ව ,,උසස් පෙල බැජ් එකට මොකද කලේ නරුමයෝ😭😭😭.........සාපවේවා.....🤮
The only cunning fox in sri lanka….extremist…he did nothing to sri lankan economy except destroying the economy on the sly with all his thieves, the government which got chased away by the public of sri lanka, and who selected him to save them from corruption and being brought to justice…he is the one who thieved the central bank with his mango friend arjun mahendran who is a singaporean and been selected him as the governor of the central bank…he is got lot accusations…
All individuals posing questions are affiliated with the LTTE diaspora, and their inquiries appear meticulously planned.
Queen of ceylon ??  mfkurrrr 😂
Thanks a lot, AL-JaZeera ❤  Mr. Mehdi Hassan Thanks a lot for this interview.
NGO scums
Kare thombu mudiyanselage ranil death uge apa India Jana rata vinasajala thawath thombu mudiyansela ennawa srilanka we Kare huththige putha
We do not accept war and what happened in the past. I know it is painful to lose loved ones. However, these kind of arguments tend to ask this question. Why no one is bothered about the civilians who were killed by the LTTE for decades? Specially sinhalese?
Ranil ia a culprit who is involved in the killings and disappearances of the innocent citizens in srilanka. He  should be punished for his crimes from 1977 up todate.
Al Jazeera ban in so many countries including USA. 😂😂😂
Chamuditha 2
World biggest lie -Sri Lankan war crime
RW is well known for displaying his aristocratic attitude, often dismissing journalists who interview him. In this instance, he resorted to bluffing, spewing a string of lies and sarcastic remarks toward both the journalists and audience members who challenged him. Truly disgraceful behavior for a political leader.
Wow, Rowan Atkinson nailed this parody interview. Spot on!
Recently Institute of Chartered Accountants brought Ranil, CBK,and Sirisena for a joke show  at their annual conference. never asked difficult questions and let these three roughs to entertain themselves. shame on CA Sri Lanka
Savage! this interview will go down in history as the day  old fox ranil got nailed..... Good job Jazeera....🎉
Hey aljazeera,  If you have balls ,  upload unedited full interview.  Bet YOU CAN'T.
He has newer won a single election on his own  So much he is popular
Ferrari on F1 racing track 😂🎉
One of key character's  of sri lankan  political landslide ...!!! This person is shame and disgrace to the sri lanka....!!!
Finaly Ranil faced real media😂😂😂
Ranil, the greatest visionary leader of Sri Lanka ever🫡
Lol, Tamil tigers are still trying to get funds. This journalist should have met Benjamin Netanyahu, poor AL Jazeera
අනුරට ඉංග්‍රීසි උගන්නල යවමුද මේකට😅😅 මෙහෙඩි හසන්ගෙ කලිසම ඔළුවෙන් ගලවයි අපෙ සහෝදරයා හුම්...

These are the ones who should be held responsible for this destruction. They deceived the innocent people and turned them into political slaves, destroying the country's wealth and resources. They should be ashamed even in front of the international community. They are not people who are fit to speak in a suit. Shame on you.
The Legend ❤
He's the saviour of the corrupt rajapaksha family
ranil He is liar...and murder..he only can selling our country ..he was one of fail president in sri lanka
Ranil wikramasinghe ❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂
හෙද වැඩේ හුත්තිගෙ පුතාට😅😅😅
Well Done Aljazeera
ස්තූතියි ❤අල් ජසීරා ,  Mehdi Hasan ❤රනිල් කියන මිනීමරුවගේ  ඇත්ත හෙලි කලාට..😢😢මේ වගේ මීනීමරු, ජනතාව ගැන වගකීමක් නැති පාලකයන් සැප්තැම්බර් 21 එලවූ ජනතාවටත් ස්තූතියි ❤✊✊✊✊
This corrupt murderous politician is directly responsible for  killing 60,000 young lives in 1988/89. The famous Batalanda torture chamber was run on his knowledge.
Well done, Mehedi. Ranil thought the audience would react the same way his supporters do when he gives an answer here in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, this audience is not as naive as some Sri Lankans.
How come BBC onetime local correspondent never mentioned atrocities LTTE did to the civilians.. When the US, British and G8 commit war crimes no one is questioning… Sri Lanka was defending its sovereignty that’s it. OH and when bunch of hooligans try to attack your Parliament what do you expect state to do say ‘oh please don’t’ we did exactly what the US did when the Capital hill was attacked.
Colombo Royal giyapu moda whottek 😂
Ranil got checkmated 😂😂😂
Two words: Poetic Justice
Really Bad journalism by Al Jazeera, When do you guys going to release another half of the interview?
Regarding Batalanda,  Ranil: Where is the report?👀 Reporter: Here it is! 😏 Ranil: Where?🥲😭
Al Jazeera and Mehdi showing what world class journalism is.
Ranil was like a child 😂
Sl gey theaf president. 😂😂😂😂😂 eat our pea 💩💩💩
What is the point in asking someone who  was always for the Rajapakses.
When Ranil became President in 2022, he knew it was an interim period, and his time was 2 years the most.  HE came in at a time when the country was Bankrupt.  When he took office he said, he can't perform miracles, BUT HE SAID HIS PRIORITY IS ONLY STABILISING THE ECONOMY.  This he did when he left office in 2024.
If he can't manage a situation like this, how could he  manage a country 😂😂😂
Himself , his uncle , uncles friends , his best friends from Rajapakse family ruined the country. Later he came to shadow his friends while fulfilling his lifetime dream of presidency. Because he knows that he can't achieve it with people's power. 😐
Thank you aljeazzra...
Welldone aljazeera
😂😂😂 cheater ghost got busted
This is the Ferrari of Sri Lanka loosing grounds to a small car lol
"Your generation has contributed to the downfall of this country. You have left the country in significant debt, amounting to over 13 billion dollars. The Central Bank has been mismanaged. Many young people from our country suffered and lost their lives in the Batalanda prisons. There seems to be no peace for you. When you pass away, the country will feel a sense of relief. You are seen as one of the biggest burdens this country faces. It would be better if individuals like you did not come into this world again. The only hope for the people of this country is to see change."
මේ හු*න්නලා තමා රට කැවෙ😆
This man is the root of all evil in sri lanka. He killed 60,000 Southerners (Sinhalese) in concentration camps in 80s. He and his uncle started civil war with northerners (Tamils) with killing them and burning down Jaffna library which was one of the most important places for our northern brothers & sisters. He should rot in a jail. but he is eyeing a job at the UN now.
මූ රටටම කෙලිය. දැන් ලෝකෙටම කෙලියි වගේ.
i wonder what  anura kumara will talk if he were here probably woudn't even able to talk and the lies he been telling
This guy is the hidden face behind lots of corrupted and murderous  acts
Well done Al Jazeera 👏🏻👏🏻
75 years of corrupt Nayaka regime still rules the country with weaponizing Buddhist extremism.
Im sri lankan .This is the man who hate sri lanka & sri lankan people. He  & Rajapaksha's only  need our tax  money . Young people's understand  him better than old people in sri lanka....we will not vote again for  him or Rajapaksha. I wish our country will  be on track  soon.
This is the guy who is protecting Rajapaksa one of the worst politicians in SL
Rajapaksha family, His goverment ministers amd their relatives and also Ranil wikramasinghe
Mehdi remember everything. Everything about so called civil war. But forgot LTTE WAS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. NOT EVEN A WORD
This election  all Srilanken given vote to Present  Sri lanken president  AKD   almost all  north and  south  have hope no ethnicity  All unite together  to build their motherland  This Ranil Wickramasinghe is a headache  to the county  Respect Al Jazera 🙏
I hate ranil too but he didn't get enough time to get anything out. Al-Jazeera took advantage of English being his 2nd language and railroaded him.  I'm glad ranil was put in his place but it looks a bit unfair.
Captain of thief හොරුන්ගෙ කැප්ටන්
Respect al Jazeera our politicians behaviour to the world
Great leader ever... Ranil wickramasingha 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro thought it's "Talk with Chamuditha" 😂
I swear I’ve never seen someone who outclasses Ranil in arguments😂 An absolute joy to watch
Vikkama singhe..😅😅😅
උඹලට චමුදිත හොද වැඩි. සීයා ඉන්ටර්නැෂනල් ජෝක්ස් සපයනවා 😄
என்ன ஒரு நிம்மதி😅
Now Do a interview with AKD current president ? He will never come
Thank you, Al Jezeera ❤
Good interview Mehdi but You Must give time to Answers,  Don't interrupt while your Guest Answer
Corrupted Ranil
Ranil is from the old camp. So he would  always protect the old  currupt system while governing. Coz, otherwise he can't survive if the old syatem is not intact.
H e is one of the best journalists and unlike Sri Lanka c hamuditha or anyone else
His main trump card is to threaten to leave when a difficult question comes up. The next trump card is to make a joke and run away from the issue. Sri Lankans will never be stupid enough to elect someone like Ranil.
LMAFO. Mehdi Hassan should actually do something instead of parroting everything he receives from liberal politics and stop playing the double games. On one hand he wants west to be more liberalized and accept middle easterners while on the other he wants no one to touch or critique the politics of his channel neither of the country that channel originates. And dude preaches like an expert on things he has no idea about in somewhere else in the world. Can see why this guy is rejected by westerners.
"LTTE terrorists are still haunting us, and we should eliminate terrorism."
Ranil was never elected by the people, and he did whatever was to stay in power. He's famous for robbing the Central Bank of Srilanka and was famous for maintaining a torture chamber that killed over tens of thousands of young people. He was famous for appointing his friends to the judiciary. Naturally, do you think a person appointed by him would go against him? See how he loses his temper, and there is evidence of this in a DW interview.
කවදාහරි අනුර ගෙ මේ වගේ interview එකක් බලාගන්න තිබ්බොත් හොඳටම ඇති. සිරසෙ සුරංග වගේ උත්තරේ කටට දීලා අහන්නේ නැතුව. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
He questions abt Batalanda.  Remember the JVP slaughtered many innocent intellectuals in 1988/89.  THE PRESENT PRESIDENT WAS A MEMBER OF THE JVP AT THAT TIME.   IF RANIL WICKREMESINGHE DID NOT CRUSH THE PROTESTERS IN 2022 THEY WD STILL BE IN THEIR TENTS IN THE GALLE FACE GREEN JUST IN FRONT OF PRESIDENTS OFFICE.  These same protesters tried to attack the parliament too.  Ranil had no alternative but to crush these protesters.   These same protesters burnt even Ranils private residence.
Whatever Al Jazeera's intention behind this interview, I salute the journalist for shedding light on the crimes committed by Murder of Batalanda.  By the way, I enjoyed Ranil's mortified expressions throughout the interview. 😂
He always portrays  himself as a well learned,smart and a capable individual and a leader...there were many people in the past did so as well ( unfortunately ,some still do)...however this interview shows the world that he's just a joker who doesn't have answers to any questions asked ,and that he was in fact a majorly failed politician and a hypocrite ,who simply tries to lie his a$$ off and tries to either joke away or act childish whenever there's valid questioning done backed by facts.....!!! Al Jazeera did an absolutely brilliant job in getting this whole thing done and showing the world the real face of  yet another wolf in sheep's clothing......!!!  What a disgrace this guy is to Sri Lankans and to all humans.......!!!
Absolutely shocking to see the comments here. RW should be applauded for appearing on this show and sharing frank perspectives on Sri Lankan matters whether you agree or disagree with him. No other Sri Lankan current politician be it Rajapakses or a Dissanayake can do this. People mocking RW here in the comments section prove how ignorant people can be of the ground realities of Sri Lankan Politics. RW should be commended for reversing a crumbling economy where all these jokers commenting spent their time on the streets in lines rather than writing nonsense online like they are doing now!
Ranil blasted Aljaseera , Weldone Mr Ranil
Great president for ever. God bless Mr president ranil ❤.
Thanks Al Jazeera for exposing this clown.🤡 Love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 ❤
Only political figure , political personality who can face this kind of  interview at the moment. He is the Ferrari. Others are Indian Marutis.
Sri lankan people who don't see anything beyond RW being hammered here, take a quick look at the "experts" at the start of the video. Evidently the moderator is biased and out of line. Maybe RW is corrupt but this staged attack tells me the moderator is in same boat, corrupt.
NICE INTERVIEW IN SRI LANKA WE DON'T HAVE GOOD MEDIA PERSONALITIES TO QUESTION THIS TYPE OF CROOKED POLITICIAN THANK YOU AL JAZEERA FOR NICE INTERVIEWE.
Ranil 😂👎🏼👎🏼
This guy is a joker. Luckily, I never considered this mugger to be my president.
Ranil is a part of the crime as well as the crisis history from his uncle's period who called JR Jayawardhana. All the previous government parties represented by thefts. They ruined this country and never tried to do any projects without corruptions. 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Sri Lanka doctors should watch this. It's shame to invite this crack to Parliament. Or the doctors are cracks.
Ranils stupid jokes and answers won't work here . Hats off brother.  Good job you nailed it .
No accountability at all
When i see mehdi vs ranil i know it'll be fun to watch 😂
Ranil❤❤❤☝️
This Interviewer is so unprofessional he is making a lot of effort to ask questions but no single patience to hear  the answers looking like dog is barking at selected anty ethnic group according to their script.
Why are you covering Sri Lanka, its a old story. Go and cover Hamas and US statement of Mr. Trump.
134 members of Rajapaksha party voted this man.
Leader and politician who to answer the question?
RANIL IS LIAR HE IS TELLING LIE. THANK YOU AL JAZEERA FOR EXPOSING THIS CROOCKED POLITICIAN IN SRI LANKA
Great Ranil Wickramasinghe🎉🎉❤❤

He is the culprit for all the allegations!!! We sri lankans know it well.
what a comedy man 😂 look at RW's hands nervous and frustrated af
THIS GUY NOT JUST CORRUPT POLITICIAN THIS GUY IS MURDERER.
Great, I always watch mehdi Hassan from the time he had his slot on MSNBC.
mehdi you beauty
What a pathetic interviewer where eu bring one person and corner them and ask just popularist questions, he took the country out of shambles and todate the youth is benefitting from his reforms he made many years back, he is the best president we never got to have full term
THIS GUY VERY CROOCKED POLITICIAN, LIAR, VERY CORRUPT GUY
Sit down comedy 😂
Why don't they question Tony Blair, George Bush Jr. about Iraq, Netaniyahu , Obama about Libya.  America should be questioned on  Afghanistan, Syria, .
Rw is the true SL leader who brought  sri lankan economy  from 70% inflection to 5%  and built 7  billion  usd doller form zero..hatts off MR Rw❤   from Camilas  🇱🇰
Yet another deeply corrupt politician who serves the interests of his elite circle of associates. He is a disgrace to Sri Lanka.
How conveniently did Chandrika hid the report of batalanda
Thank you. Thank you .Thank you so much Al Jezeera
This old man drove the country to collapse during 2015-2019. It only blast in 2022. He didn't reduce inflation the IMF did and the people of Sri Lanka
Mehdi is really unprofessional. He should let him speak finish 1st
Ranil wickramasinghe is the one and only leader who saved the sinking economy of the country! I respect him ♥
😂😂😂 I must say this is the only time I ever feeled sorry for that lunatic ranil wickramasinghe😂😂 Well done mehedi hasan ❤❤❤ for this and for the interwive of vivek ramasamy as well ❤❤ keep up the good work
Stupid Sri Lankans who are watching this interview  do not know the facts that Al Jazeera is sponsored by the Liberal Qatari regime who is also responsible for sponsoring many terrorists in the middle east region. Mehdi Hasan is a joke who openly advocates and justifies for terrorism! If any foreign journalist interview any sri lankan politician, regardless of the journalist being a devil, they will cheer up for him since they cannot tolerate politicians being reasonable!
අම්මො රෙද්දේ රෙවෙනවා සීයට😅😅😅😅
Where's ur ferari license ??
Tamil genocide in 2015 ? that lady is trapped in her own loop 😂😂😂
Please give a part of United Kingdom for Tamil Eelam.  So all can live in UK. We can donate for air tickets. 😂 Keep in mind, they would like Norther part of UK.
This is what wrong with the mass media. The don’t let the guest talk.
Why the journalist didn't ask about bheeshana yougaya, why akd didn't let election to be happend in 1989, akd shooted 1st 3 people who went to vote, 73 transformers were broken, 65000 UNPers were killed, AKD who stood with MAHINDA in 1999, 2005 and 2018.  Is this journalist a fool ? Now its being 6+ months that akd get into the president. So, now the Rajapaksas are in jail ? Akd said he has 400 files. Why akd isn't arresting Rajapaksas though he has all the files
Well done Al Jazeera👏👏
Shame to Sri Lanka
This guy Hasaan never had any nerve to have time for  his counterpart to forward his opinion..shame  Hasaan 🤔
EU . You are killing kids and children in Gaza .. what is the countability ?
රනිල් බොක වෙනවා 😂
Best Mr. Bean show ever
Ranil wikrasinhe is the least corrupt politician as far as I know . He has not amassed wealth His only house was burnt down in 2022 , He got it renovated and went back there he nevwer asked for privilages allocated for former presidents . While all the other countries which went bankrupt  took more than dozens of years to recover this man Ranil was able to salvage the country in just two years  .  . he is a man of peace not wars .thats why he signed a truce with the LTTE in 2002 just after he becme the Prime Minister
He is real central bank thief
He was never accepted a challenge. He was rejected by the Sri Lankan people. He even came to parliament through a backdoor and then his clan placed him to avoid the people's rejection.
interviewer is trying to be Donold Trump here assuming Ranil as Zelenski.
This interview seems scripted I ln such a way to disgrace srilanka and Ranjl. He had done many things to srilanka compared to others and he had to face this interviews in front anti-SriLankans
This guy is crazy....  he make srilanka joke
he is corrupted politician
"if mob happened here what will you do "" Ranil nailed it ..well done boss ❤️
Please add sinhala subtitles ...
One of the Most corrupted politicians.
Ranil he’s uncle JR  Jayawardana and  Rajapaksha’s regime all are destroyed SriLanka they only enjoyed themselves didn’t care for people of Srilanka😢   People never liked him, he’s a cunning man like a fox
Thanks! Al jesera
Absolutely satisfying interview! During his whole political career he played both sides and made citizens as his sacrifice for his gains. Today, RW made himself a joker in the international platform. Kudos to the journalist on the thorough research. We just go rid of this menace. Hopefully this will open the eyes of those political sl4v3s who still glorify him.
Ranil wickramasinghe protecting all corruptions of rajapaksha family.he is killed innocent university student in batalanda.
ලැජ්ජ නැතුව යන ලස්සන බැනුන් අහන්න 🤭 ranil wickramasinghe is the most trusted person to mahindha rajapaksha more than his wife 😅
Diaspora
Mr.Bean
Ranil robbed the central bank. This man is a thief.
Who is the Sri Lanka Central Bank Thief ? why didn't you ask ?
Looks like Mr. Bean
There is no question about who RW is. He is a very corrupt politician. However, I feel the interview is very bias with a clear narrative. Specially when it comes to latter part of the questions, first i was from south and I am a witness of war when temple of the tooth was bomed, many bus bombs so and so. it was a war against terrorists. So many people died from both sides of this unnecessary war. Time has come to get over this hate and build a harmonious future. Rajapaksha tired to sell the war for 3 elections but they couldn’t. now majority of Sinhalese don’t even care if he won the war or not! Let people live in harmony in one county- Sri lanka 🇱🇰 just like it used to be.  You cannot possibility connect whats happening in gaza to what happened in Sri Lanka. US and UK support Israel on this. You dont have to connect gaza with sri lanka just because someone said so. It far more chaotic and should take that sperately.  most importantly it’s happening right now
What a joker, thank you Al Jazeera! (Mehdi) No Sri Lankan journalist has questioned him like this.
A failed politician. What did he done to Sri Lanka ?
Very good interview.   Ranil was cornered left and right
Terrorist tv channel 😂
රනිල් කියන්නේ හොරෙක්
Those who prevented Ranil from winning the 2005 presidential election and brought Mahinda Rajapaksa to power are now questioning Ranil about Mahinda Rajapaksa. Have mercy on them
Looks like Mr.Bean's  live show 😂
😂😂
This cunning old crook was 6 times Prime Minister of SL. Was in parliament for many decades. Only thought of self survival in politics and no any genuine intension of building the country.
THIS LUNATIC SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN BORN. SIMPLE AS THAT.
How could he have gone for a system change by not putting the show back of the road and prosecute the criminals when he himself is criminal
Al Jazeera should teach their staff how to conduct a decent interview.
"Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crises?" You are sitting in front of one of those crooks. Rest is Ranil Rajapaksa clan and henchmen
Poor Ranil’s tupidity at it’s extreme 😂
Not just the tamil the entire nation wants the Rajapakshes behind bars
Corrupt jerk who has stuffed his pockets full just like the others before him, the Rajapaksa family
Attorney General was a stooge of Ranil and Rajapakses
44:26 Even though I don’t like Ranil personally, he denied the false allegations against the Sri Lankan army made by the LTTE diaspora, who participated in the meeting, very well. I appreciate that as a Sri Lankan
Mehdi Hasan is Hamas sympathizer..He is a terrorist
Respect Mehdi Hasan From Srilanka🫡🇱🇰.
Typical joker
Balant lyes
Welldone aljazeera ❤❤ for exposing this big time clown and selfish dictator💩
Chamuditha of al jazeera 😂
“With the respect, several hundred people died. It’s not that funny!”   Not single interviewer or a journalist from Sri Lanka could ever tell this man these lines although though the cases like Easter Sunday and many more seemed funny things to him.
2/3 of the panel = NGOs ✅ Constant jump cuts ✅ Crowd filled LTTE diaspora ✅ Ask question then cut off ✅  This is disgusting gotcha gutter journalism 101.
Mehdi rocked ✌️ From srilanka 🇱🇰
People comment here who  critisize ranil wickramasinghe   are forgot al- jasira history. How did they support tamil elams propaganda 🤔
Childish so true
Former president Ranil Wikramasinghe is my political hero before mahinda rajapaksha❤️🇱🇰🇱🇰
Ranil wickramasinghe is the true Srilankan leader who braught the Srilankan economy from 70% inflation to 5% and built 7-BillionUSD reserves from zero .people who live in srilanka know how he recovered the country that had no electricity for 14 hours . ARM CHAIR CRITICS and the ruling party NPP mobs who burned 400 houses in the country are trying to tarnish his image . Remarkable economic recovery within 2 years sir  … hats off sir ❤
Sri Lankan Mr bean 😂😂
ranil best 😍
Ranil fails to understand that he is not the sole occupant of this universe. He was a backdoor caretaker President, and a failed caretaker at that.
ඉංග්‍රීසි වචන දෙකක් ගලප ගන්න බැරි ලපයගෙ වියලි කලාපෙ පඟරනැට්ටො ගොන් සෙට් එක රනිල්ට ටියුෂන් දෙනවා😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂උන් දන් නැ උන්ගේ එකාට ඔවාට ගියාම චු යනවා කියලා
Shame on this journalist who does not allow to answer the person whom he is interviewing and to be frank there is no war crimes and thank you Mr President for slapping the west ❤
Liarr !
What about the Central Bank Scandal. To date nothing has been done. He is intimidating you Mr Mehdi Hasan. He is a political write-off.
26.56 😂
this clown was a  president?!
Mst currupted president in sri lanka.
🛑 Sri Lanka fell into this disastrous state because the thugs of Wicakramasinghe Rajapaksa ruled the country. Wickremesinghe's behavior in this discussion is a good example of his blatant rule.
We, the civilians know what he did for the country. Al Jazeera should be ashamed for working on someone else’s agenda! We are no more without him so better mind your own business.
I believe as srilankan we are very very unluky this person came to politics in srilanka.he ruined our future & unborn.this guy run country typicaly as his answer questions.still curse not finished.all credit to aljazeera for fearless answering questions.
26:31 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ranil is nothing but a smooth criminal! Way to go Mehdi 👏🏼
President Wickramasinghe ❤ We Love you Not LTTE media show

Cunning fox
Ranil is an arrogant idiot
man this is hard to watch 😅
Better than Mr. Bean😂
In Sri Lanka we call him "Mr. Bean"!🤣
If lapaya was thier. .. journalist would be silent 🤌🤣
He is known as "Butcher of Batalanda". You should also ask about the 60000 youths killed in south.
The tamils are harping about 1983. How about them burning FIVE of CAPITALS? Killing millions of people never allowing our economy to recover.
Glad this interview showed Ranil for who he really is - and Mehdir Hasan didn’t do that. Ranil did so by his own conduct 🫠 Mehdi also came with receipts. Ranil failed to respond clearly and got worked up / flustered.  One thing I wish Mehdi also could have brought up would have been the Central Bank bond scam.   There is much to learn here for Sri Lankan journalists.
ලපය ගියානම් රෙද්දේ චූ ගිහින්.....
Thanks for this interview, Al Jazeera and Mehdi. People in our country have suffered too long because of these crony politicians, especially Ranil W.
Mehdi Hassan is bull...
Typical Interviewer always do not allow to complete the explanation.  The PM is not the asministrator of laws but runs the country based on the constitution.
This guy is cures to the country
will Al Jazeera question Benjamin Netanyahu like this?? they only blame Rajpaksas war crimes and corruption, how about questioning bush, biden and netanyahu, Ranil wikramasinha was appointed for the economic crisis and not to investigate about the rajpaksas, he wasn't voted for president, he was appointed as a sudden backup plan to tackle the crisis
RW should npot be wasting his precious time with these totally baised dfiaspora initiated inteviews that have their own hidden agenda, in my view
Mr. Former president became a joke here. What a shame
😂 this old fqr 💩 shame ponil shame
Uncle Ranil! Talking in his uncle style love it
Not a fan of Ranil or his politics, but this audience is clearly one sided.
Glad to see a courageous journalist questioning him He couldn't play his usual arguments with Mehdi
Nothing this person joked about was funny for Sri Lankans who suffered under his incompetence.
LOL the comments. its funny to see paid comments defending this guy
This man is not a Buddhist . He is a karapothu lansiya. Who has no idea about any religion!!
The cunning fox ranil😂....is raping...😂
19:37🙏🙏🙏💪💪💪
Sri Lankan Mr. Bean. Ranil 😂
ඕකා අමු හොරෙක්. ශ්‍රීලංකාව විනාසකරපු එකෙක්.
Whatever said and done, he had balls to sit down with that audience!
He's a bad egg 😂. No one cares him in the country. Get lost Ranil.
What is with the constant jumpcuts when the ex SL president was speaking?
We have to protect the democracy from mob which was backed  by EU or other international elements, may be LTTE diaspora..  Mr reporter you want sri lanka to allow mobs to burn the parliament?
The fox got fixed
Srilankan crazy man.  Why do you invite this kind of people? This is the most corrupted political idiot of srilanka. Please
NOT LIKE LAPAYA
RW is one of the bset Politicians in Sri Lanka. You guys should read what he did in the Past. Yes he did wrong things too.. But comparing him with Rajapaksas he is a good and smart politician.   President Wickramasinghe I ve never voted you ! But you were the one who took responsibilities of this country when no one is there.   Love from 🇱🇰
Thank u Al-Jazeera.❤❤❤❤
Every  time mr  wickramasinher devoted  his time ,energy  and  everything  for the country !  A great  leader   ❤🙏
The Arrogance of Mr Wickremasinghe is really disappointing. That’s why he lost the election
This is the Donald Trump of Sri Lanka. Very egocentric and stubborn
Joker 🤡
Reporters must ask the the question cleaely and give the time to answer ... why the reporter is jumping like  frog or a dog and disturbing without complete his answer ??
What a joke. This man is utter BS... He never won an election... He is responsible for t he torturing and killing of hundreds of innocents in Batalanda... It's in his nature to make deals with oppositions to hide from his sins...
Deshadrohi avajathaka cari ponnayos understand karapan me politician Ranilwa nemei constant jump cut edit joke karanne thamuselage entire ratai. Mekata kiyanne hitpiece journalism kiyala.

කොට්ටෝරුවට අද තමයි කෙහෙල් ගහක් අහුවුනෙ😂😂
Ranil has two faces 👺🤡
Be cautious of him; his hands are still stained with blood.😢
Not a word about inquiring about the attrocities of the LTTE. Wow!
His goons also violently beat the Sirasa TV journalists who were covering the situation near his home.
End of an era.  Thank you Mehdi Hassan and Aljazeera for ending this disgusting man
Ranil's biggest weakness is his love for the corrupted Rajapaksa family!
A killer, A thief, A cheater.... this man should be in jail for life time.
at world stage ranil became a joker
Great interview. Ranil’s true colours came out together with his arrogance. Batalanda report though not presented to parliament it is there. A well known secret his part in Batalanda torture camp. I hope he retires peacefully without causing further damage.
With Mehdi there's no escape u might be the most cunning politician but not with him
Al Jazira is in the ltte and their puppet masters'  pockets. I dont like mr wickramasingha but he has the backbone to stand upto the bullying

This cleaver guy was instrumental for dividing the people of Sri Lanka for their benfits.  He was in power when rare  books were burnt alone with Jaffna library.   That's sum up him how he treated his own people.
Mr bean = Ranil Wikramasingha
What a baboon.
Crazy old man
We Sri Lankans know that Ranil is a ruthless, arrogant fox. My regards to Al Jazeera.
Seeya left 😂😂😂
Good to see you in Aljezira , Mahdi hassan
රනිල්❤❤❤
Well done Medhi Hassan ❤
the  funny thing  though is the first audience member "picked" to ask a question is the unrepentant ltte terrorist sympathiser nandakumar, linked to the banned ltte fromt organisations TRO & TYO  who camer out on BBC after the eater attackes and blamed the sinhaleese for the attacks , ranil and them belong together , peas of the same pod
Chamuditha = Mehdi Hasan
රනිල්❤
lol singing at the rajapaksha birthday

Ltte killed those tamil people at vellamuliiwaikkal, they kept tamil people as hostages. It is a shame to see  the  world trying to cover up ltte terrorists' war crimes
As a Srilankan I am telling just a one thing "Ranil wickremesinghe is lying"
Hon.ranil wickremesinghe❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
All escape tigers live in london 😂😂
This is brutal to watch, seriously. Anyway, I love how Mehdi Hasan breaks down Ranil from top to bottom with just very simple questions.

This Interview Should translate to Sinhala and telecast in every single channel in sri lanka. 😅😅
The demon who killed lot of peoples
Well done Al Jazeera🎉🎉
Its a shame that our former president couldn’t answer the questions and having a childish behavior..omg
The most evil 😈 cunning politician in Sri Lanka. People still can’t understand how evil he is 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡😡😡
@aljazeera - CRISIS, not CRISES.
United state & Eu is terrorists
Legend Ranil.... Rescued SL from crisis which if not would've ended up like Libya or Zimbabwe
No one questions politicians like this in Sri Lanka. Respect
Nah, Mr.Ranil made that guy look like a 🤡 in his own show, lol. You can't outsmart a genius like him.
Sri lankan no 1 culprit. he killed so many youngsters. He is beyond evil. Well done Al jazeera
Ranil wickramasinghe❤❤❤❤
Ranil Wickremesinghe’s tenure has been marked by economic mismanagement, failed policies, and a deepening crisis that has left Sri Lanka in financial ruin. His neoliberal approach prioritized debt-fueled growth, allowing corruption and misgovernance to thrive, ultimately leading to the nation’s bankruptcy. Instead of addressing the root causes of economic collapse, his administration burdened the people with austerity measures, increased taxes, and a lack of accountability.  All the best to Al Jazeera for directly questioning him—something many Sri Lankans wish they could do. Shame on Ranil for steering a once-thriving nation into economic despair while evading responsibility for the suffering of millions.
RANIL HORA 🤡💩
Good to see this master class - Mahdi is a TALENT that ME/AJ should NEVER let go !
Regarding Al Jazeera and other well-known media outlets, during the LTTE war in Sri Lanka, they spread fake news worldwide, portraying the Sri Lankan Army as the wrongdoers. This interview is a good opportunity to show who Sri Lankans truly are. One media channel should not have the power to push South Asian countries back or tarnish their image.  Thank you, Ranil Wickremesinghe, for making our country great again from 2022 to 2024. Otherwise, even the media wouldn’t have paid attention to what happened to the Sri Lankan people.
Aiyoo Ranil!

Ranil he is a Thief
mr bean😅
The failure system kills and brutally tortures  their people by disappearing them  who raise their voice for justice.
It's sad that the majority of Sri Lankans won’t watch or understand this. I wish they could. Someone should add subtitles and broadcast it on national television.
Rajapaksa’s saviour 😂
Guy is unmasked in front of the World at last - as an arrogant, self serving ,  unempathetic , petty , selfish old white collar criminal
The corrupt man who led the opposition for 30 years to protect the corrupt.
very childish nasty president ranil wickremesinghe what a comedy piece on international level
The Ferrari broke down right at the start of the interview!!!  Thanks Al jazeera
“I couldn’t accept blaming him, as he was surrounded by the Tamil diaspora and LTTE terrorists who ruined this country for over 30 years and killed innocent people
He is the reason for ruining the Sri Lanka
Very Sorry Former President RW
Mehdi hassan is back in jazeera😂😂
Velupillei prabhakaran is terrorists,basterd
The person who is interviewing clearly has an agenda. I say this because he has not done his homework what really goes on in Sri Lanka
Did anyone talk about how LTTE did war crimes on those days ? How 6 hunderd police officer were killed
Well done Al- Jazeera ...
As a Srilankan Tamil we knew for long time before these guys are corrupt and political pimps. But our fellow sinhala brothers and sisters just realised how these guys are bad. They ruled for a long time, dividing the country and the people for their selfish interests. They are shedding crocodile tears today after bringing the country to the brink of collapse.
Sri lanka now free country
Tamil tigers is terrorists
Respect! The president stopped a country from economic collapse. Great interview. Also whats the point if you wont let your guest speak and edit the and cut the responses. Shame Al Jazeera.
Ranil Rajapakase
A man who abused the law as he pleased, without valuing the rule of law in Sri Lanka.

A corrupt thief
Ranil flew all the way to the UK to get cooked? 😂
Dr Madura Rasaratnam was absolutely spot on about the figures. It was indeed a Rajapakse majority who backed him in the previous parliament. It was not even the SJB. Ranil is a great big liar.
A killer, A thief, A cheater.... this man should be in jail foe life time.
No country where NGOs are taking foreign aid will ever prosper. It’s a cleverly camouflaged bribe to destabilise governments.

45:58 😂😂
A group of Tamils clapping and cheering like absolute clowns 🤡
This old, murderous thug—twice defeated in past presidential elections and completely rejected by the people of Sri Lanka before 2024 presidential election. somehow clawed his way back to power, thanks to the Rajapaksa mafia. He was their puppet, squeezed the common people with economic hardship while his elite cronies treated government funds like their personal jackpot. But karma is finally knocking. The new NPP government is ripping the mask off his corruption, exposing the mountain of bribes he shamelessly pocketed. At 77, this washed-up dictator is one of the biggest reasons Sri Lanka is still stuck in the Third World. For decades, he’s let his inner circle plunder the nation, and now, like a desperate villain in his final act, he’s scrambling for one last chance to destabilize the country—just so he can loot whatever's left before he keels over.
What an embarrassment this man is for Sri Lanka. Please keep him in England
Good job Mr president ❤
Mehdi Hasan had decided to be  well mannered in the future.  He couldn't play his cards with Ranil.
Omg 😂😂😂
Ranil❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Mr Ranil, a gem of a politician that will be remembered for your service in the history of Sri Lanka

Al Jazeera well done 👌👌
25:30 .....Finnaly there is a TV show to adress and question the killing of the Tamil civilian and ethnic cleansing in Sri Lanka....Tq Al Jazeera and special guest !
No matter you agree with this guy. You can't deny that he is very brave. He came to the show knowing all the guests and audience were against him. And he kept himself nonchalant and composed the whole time.
Jeez.... how can he avoid the main question about not bringing Rajapakshas for what they had done?????
Ranil may be a clown, but whos the clown that invites someone to an interview and does not allow that person to talk or express his views. The interviewer was more interested in looking like a giant killer instead...... i bet he will not do that to someone like biden, putin or the polish president...
This man was responsible for thousands of deaths in Sri Lanka, specially 88/89
RW is a liar
The government has the right to protect its people, which is why security forces exist. When protesters attack Parliament and other public institutions, it is the president’s duty to deploy security forces to restore order. There is nothing wrong with that.  Did the president violate the Constitution? No. Are we in a better place compared to when he took office? Yes.
Ranil❤
The West constantly accuses Sri Lanka of various issues, but we are grateful to have a leader like Ranil Wickremesinghe who can stand his ground on the global stage. Unfortunately, the current administration has struggled to defend the country in such forums with the same strength.  We stand united as Sinhala and Tamil people, no matter how much Western media tries to divide us to serve their own agenda.  We will always be grateful for a strong and decisive leader who took charge when Sri Lanka had no electricity, no food, and no fertilizer.  Foreign media, driven by the interests of the Western world, continue to push their narrative and attempt to create divisions among our people. But we remain united, and we stand with Ranil Wickremesinghe!
No one justice for war criminal 😢😢😢😢😢😢 this world political war criminal until now no justice criminal UN cover case for war criminal justice 😢😢😢😢😢

Ranil wickramasinghe- I was into politics before you were even born !  Ranil ,sri lanka’s biggest asset !❤️❤️
Ranil❤❤❤❤❤
He is Mr.bean 😂😂😂😂
Good questions, but no need to forget this is made up to corner him. All know there are some ethinic group wanted a another country inside Sri Lanka, But Tamils in Sri Lanka have changed now, majority Tamil people voted for current government, When there is a war, it's a common practice to sue government after a war, look at Russia. Only the Tamils outside Sri Lanka are in this mindset. They don't like peace with majority Sinhalese. They just want a another country to rule by there high caste of Tamils. Even Tamils in India want a another country , even though they have separate state. People who view this should understand this is a mindset of them. It is the real issue and should tackle down. Reason why these Tamil hate him because he was a master mind behind breaking that terrorist group to two parts. He is not good in some aspects, People shouldnt forgot these things as war crimes , also terrorist groups know that. They use that when the war is going. Why these people didn't talk about the children who have dragged by there leader as child soldiers.
You should bring PRESIDENT AKD and ask about rajapaksha's Because they are the ones who supported him in the firstly NOT A LEADER WHO DID A GREAT JOB AS THE PRESIDENT FROM 2022-2024 WITH NOTHING RW❤❤❤❤❤

Joker becomes the joke for 40 minutes 😂
Ranil❤❤❤❤
Well done Hassan. You are simply brilliant. Your background check on Ranil and his governance is just impeccable. Ranil is just the worst and the most cunning politicians ever and he is a culprit in making Sri Lanka bankrupt.
Ranilt wickramasinhe and mahinda rajapakshe are bad politicians
What a clown this guy is 😂
This man belong to during the Colonial period his grand fathers worked as  Spying
Ranil Wickremesinghe took charge of Sri Lanka at one of the darkest moments in the nation’s history. With the country facing an unprecedented economic collapse, severe shortages of essential goods, and civil unrest, his leadership was pivotal in stabilizing the situation and preventing a humanitarian catastrophe.  Upon assuming office, President Wickremesinghe swiftly implemented economic reforms, secured international financial assistance, and took decisive action to restore essential supplies of food, medicine, and fuel. His diplomatic efforts were instrumental in negotiating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), restoring investor confidence, and rebuilding Sri Lanka’s credibility on the global stage.  Despite immense political and social challenges, he remained steadfast in ensuring that Sri Lanka did not descend into deeper chaos. His leadership helped the nation regain stability, ease the suffering of millions, and set the foundation for long-term economic recovery.  We, as a nation, owe a deep sense of gratitude to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his unwavering commitment to protecting Sri Lanka during its most perilous times. His resilience, wisdom, and strategic vision have safeguarded the country from collapse, paving the way for a hopeful future. Thank you, President Wickremesinghe, for standing firm in the face of adversity and defending Sri Lanka when it needed you the most.

Ranil got hammered 😅😅😅😅
I dislike this guy leading the interview as he long time ago interviewed some dignetory and was in favor of the LTTE. Never gave the dignetory an opportunity to clarify the stand of the government. He's done the same time after time with other countries. I guess it's his job to be famous though there's no Merritt to his shallow study of the issues he's interviewing. The interviewer should not be biased. But I'm glade he put this nut bag in his place and not allowing RW to dominate or allowing him to leave as he has done so many times before when things didn't go his way. This is amusing 😂. Humiliated!! 😂
26:40 Did the Sri Lankan PM just say crash out? 💀
Al Jazeera's interview with Mehdi Hasan seems to reflect a propagandist approach. It’s puzzling how Hasan overlooks the 30-year span of LTTE terrorism(not forgetting how they used Tamil civilians as a human-sheild at the last stage of civil war) and its devastating impact. Furthermore, he appears unable to recognize that Sri Lanka has never truly faced an 'ethnic issue' as often portrayed. Mehdi still has much to learn, as even Ranil Wickremesinghe has pointed out.
Now everyone knows why he cant be a president...not even a capacity to talk to a international media 😂
The grilling is unprecedented!!! Bravo
පඹයගේ රෙද්ද ගැලවුනා නේද 😂
Great thanks 🙏👍 sir
We call him Mr Bean.
Ranil rajapakshe
End of corruption era.  Thank you al jazeera ❤️😂
He is the WORST interviewer.  Making statements like, asking questions and not giving the guest time to answer.  Rude, unprofessional, brat vibes.
This is a Biased interview ~ as a citizen of Srilanka we appreciate him taking hard steps to crack down and bring normalcy and recovering the economy - it’s easy to question but hard to rule- having said that we voted for current president to test a different person who is much younger and seen Uncorrepted ~ let’s hope they deliver - Weldone Ranil
This is the kind of interview we should do more often with politicians here in sri lanka. Kudos to the team and mehdi hassan.
6:37  9:27 11:31 13:36
Godfather of ranilwikrama  million   peoples tortured to build  Consentration camp  in siri lanka
Why this journalist always tried to separate us. He always says catholic catholics. Those are humans. 269 died people all are sri lankans. (We never ever seprate them as you told like catholics ).  You must learn what journalism dude. 😊😊
මේයකා රටේ දේශපාලනේට වගේම රටට පට්ට සාපයක්. 😑
One and only Ranil Wickramasinghe 💪💪
Haha.. what an idiot..this is what happens when you have majority affirmative action policies.. such a shame on the intellect of this clown…compared to the folks from Jaffna.
In the part that they talk about civil war the journalist and othor tamil woumen in the board sound like they are biased to tamil diaspora's side also 39:01 also this man is asking why dont tamil people dont get seperate nation in srilanka its like black people getting a seperate state in america 😂

Didn't he say there was nobody to step in at that moment? This guy is a liar. Dalus and Anura wanted to lead the country. However, the majority of the corrupt politicians in parliament were on his side and appointed him as president. That's what happened.  Regarding the IMF, President Gotabaya had already started discussions in April 2022, even before this person stepped in. Additionally, Gotabaya appointed a new governor to lead the IMF team. This guy is nothing but a deceiver.
Rw❤
Naakiya ded! Thank you Mehdi!
RW❤ best president in Sri Lanka
The former president is funny 😂🤣😅
රාජපක්ෂලා එක්ක රට බංකොලොත් කරලා දැන් බයිලා ගහනවා. මූ ලංකාවටත් ලජ්ජාවක්

Journalist (Mehdi Hasan) -: I done my mission. Tamil Diaspora Terrorists -: Okay. We are credited to 10000$ to your Bank Account.                       Deal Done.😊
Finally someone confronting this imbecile about his evil past. It only took 36 years.
Sri Lankan Mr.bean
RW ❤❤
Ranil is a Joker. (Pissu pusa)
This person is a disgrace to Sri Lanka
He is acting like a joker 😂😂
LOL Ranil😂
Ranil cant handle this situation...
Thanks for exposing this corrupt, abusive status quo politican in front of the international community
RW 👍
He's a disgrace for Sri Lanka
What cunning joker this Ranil Wickramasingha?
What an absolute disgrace, Al Jazeera & Mehdi Hasan! Is this how you speak to a highly respected and dignified leader? Ranil Wickremesinghe is one of Sri Lanka’s greatest leaders—one who has never resorted to racism or cheap tactics to gain power. When the country was in its worst crisis, others ran and hid, but he had the courage to step up and take responsibility. While others lacked the spine to lead, he faced the challenge head-on. Show some respect!
Ranil
Mr.  Hussein, who is a priest of extreme woke religion, does not understand how politics and democracy work in the subcontinent. I am not a supporter of Mr. Wickramsinghe, but Mr. Hussein is the worst journalist who opposes dissent. This man bans me from his Twitter page for criticizing his woke religion.  Shame on Mehidi.
He is a thief .. he robbed the central bank in daylight
It's the same. Stupid answers. Nothing changed.
Mehedi's arguments are not comprehensive. These questions have already been answered in many interviews.. Ranil is the one who brought the country back on track, which is why elections were held.democracy kept.... Most of the questions should be directed at Rajapaksa, as they are the ones who should have been held accountable
*Head to Head is my favorite ❤❤❤❤❤!* 🇺🇬
What do you expect from this jihaa💥I  ranter ‘spit Hassan’  &  ter channel al jaz   Twer* will he question global Islamic ter * group heads like this ??? 🤣
RANIL is not only a thief and a beggar, he held a perfect dictatorship throughout these years. He used his dictatorial powers to misuse public funds and use them for the election ..please note he was not appointed as president from public  vote..but trough conspiracy 😊
A failed politician on top of everything. What a joke lol
This guy is one of the biggest disasters that happened to Srilanka. He is not responsible for bringing the economy back. There were very good professionals that did it, and this fool was inn the right place at tge right time. Total a** hole.
to be honest you just make al jazeera  a great media
Non violent country? Are you kidding me.
This guy corrupted Sri Lankan politics for over four decades. It’s great that Mehdi took things up to him. These culprits should be exposed!
This Muslim Brotherhood Kawarij isn't letting him talk.
Most corrupted crook politician in Sri Lanka😂❤
Ranil Wickramasinghe is a power hungry, selfish, greedy man. This is why the best in his party left him and formed their own party. This guy is a complete fraud.
Simple answer - corruption of chinese money which is well planned
Oh Ferrari. 😂
Wow Ranil just shot himself on the foot! He should’ve never taken this interview!
Want to again for SL mr. President ❤
The Crook has been unmasked in front of an international audience finally! A treat to watch! 😂😂
Never ever debate with a goat...mehdi good at barking
Corrupted old man, he never saved sri lanka, he is the one made it worse. Sri lankan losers think he is a saviour.
sorry mate. reddi left big time !!
Well Done Al-Jazeera! ❤
Mehdi dissected this man like a 5th grader would a frog in science class. 🐸
Keri pakaya ranil - he is the one who saved all robbers n looted bank pakaya
I saw the title and I had thought that al jazeera would blame israel
Ranil he keriya nariya 🦊 he saved all Robbers in sl mainly rajapaksas gr8 aljazeera
Shame on you ranil hora
The Visionary leader who never chosen themselves by unfortunate sri lankans
Ha Haa 😂😂
Ranil is a top thief..but he doesn't steel for himself..he lets all of his officers..ministers steal in broad daylight just for his political survival.
Mr ranil rajapaksha. He is like a fox 🦊 in politics. And biggest threats to SriLanka so far is rajapaksha family....
I respect mr ranil he recovered our country from inflation .
Ranil is a cold blooded murderer ! A thief of public funds and a massive crook.  Thanks Al jazeera for revealing this crook. you got the personality which our local journalists lack. We all admire that. Weldone Hasan !
Ferrari broke down I Repeat Ferrari broke down!!!
" parliament elected veteran politician" should be changed to "Gota appointed ..."  what a joke!
Why is the Aljazeera host so disrespectful. Ever heard of waiting your turn to talk?
he has been a president once!! but never elected by the people , he was only elected by the rajapaksha crooks who were the mp's in the parliament , he should not have been even in parliament he came to the parliament through the national list after saying if the people didntvote foe him , people dint vote for him he didnt even get 30k votes  he will never come in through the national list, we waited for for 6 months then snuck in through the national list anyway , disgusting power hungry fellow this
Arguebaly he is the most currupted politician in sri lanaka
Ranil Rajapakse, the Butcher of Batalanda, Uber fan of Rajapkses getting his masked pulled out in front of a global audience! This narcissist is not only a mass murderer but crook of the highest degree
Rw ❤️❤️
He was the part of the problem we were trying to get rid of but he found a loophole to hijack our movement and did everything to protect the thieves and suppress us while delaying the elections! But even after two years people didn’t forget, we got rid of him!
Rajapaksha & Ranil Wikramasinghe Failed country.Ranil 06 time prime minister 😂  Rajapaksa 02 time president 😂
Mr Ranil is the Thief & the beggar 😢
Great Job Mr. President! ❤❤
