UP THE VILLA 💪
Nunez with a miss of the season
Visit Tanzania 🇹🇿 is a good place compere to saudia aribia
Thanks you billa from okashatu Auwalu
Rashford, didn't track back so it's make space free for Trent to shot
How do you give out such a ball even a school boy wouldn't Aston villa should have have won this game..
Cracking match. UTV
So happy to see this ball design back. Absolutely loved it from back in the day #T90
After the Man U players see how rashford and Antony are performing all of the players are gonna leave the club
I don’t suppose you noticed, or anyone for that matter, certainly not tv or radio, noticed Watkins’ goal v Liverpool was created via 22 patiently crafted passes with every outfield player involved except Rashford, culminating in a one-two with Digne. A truly well worked brilliant team constructed move and goal.  Certainly one of the very best in the 50+ years I been watching Villa.
Just wanted to thank marcus rashford for trying and puttin effort in for ever how short a time he is here utv marcus!
perfect
This is as bad as LFCTV - i mean, Sky sports. We absolutely battered them last 10 minutes but not a peep about it
Liverpool didnt show the Villa goals so im here
Prod for Rashford🎉
I don't think there's a better crosser of the ball in the premier league than digne.
UTFV
Disasi looks a powerhouse, solid performance. Rashford rather wasteful but nothing approaching Bailey.
Nunez zero point😂😂
Watkins is a pure class striker
The commentators were very unbiased 😂
Poor highlights. TNT showed the 3 chances Villa had to win it late in the game.
Arsenal fan here, thank you villa for the draw
Good aston vila for decrease point liver wait daby again city
https://youtube.com/@ntantex?si=mtIE3Tf-3QQrWU9z
it’s on rasjford he shd at least close down trent
Liverpool need a @Asencio type of player.
This Aston Villa team is looking really good to me
Same old rashford😂
Mings turning his back on the shot
Why are these highlights videos so short? Is it a rights issue or something?
Liverpool no be team
Telamans is a very talented midfielder .....
I don’t suppose you noticed, or anyone for that matter, certainly not tv or radio, noticed Watkins’ goal was created via 22 passes with every outfield player involved except Rashford, culminating in a one-two with Digne. A truly well worked brilliant move and goal👌
What a crossing from digne...
No pinalty not won
Liverpool is the luckiest team ever. How can Disasi make that pass??? Does he need glasses?
its not the govt, its the people (who are "morally correct") filing a case against samay raina so police report is filed and it'll be fought in court now.
Life long united fan, watching villa as always believed in Rashford, must say Villa are exciting and I believe will develop into major force , Good passion and team play, puts united to shame and highlights what’s wrong at OT
They should come and win Manchester united my club 😂
Against the big teams villa in transition are great to watch
From Liverpool fan, Nunez replacement shouldn't be isak, Watkins is better in my opinion, deadly and creative with his finishing
Salah is great but that winner shows the flaw in the assist stat.  Passes the ball to a player outside the box who hits a deflected shot home.....
Proper football😊Diamonds021
Old version of rashford
Deserves all 3 points but unfortunately VAR thought otherwise
Can't wait to see how Villa will perform in the UCL.. they have an exciting squad
Nunez and Slot played against Liverpool.
Premier league?
Vous êtes forts les gars
Guus job aston
as a arsenal fan I cant thank u enough
Negative comments on ollie..but what about his goal hey..mugs..
Liverpool needs to work hard ❤
I can't believe these highlights missed the late chances for both teams. Malen was so close to goal in the last minute, and you didn't even include it.  Great match that deserves a bit more highlights than this
Win is not but draw was not good
🔥🔥
Rashford and Asencio heading for 007.... I'll be here🧐
ha ha ha😂 szoposzlói🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Chelsea we really need to be very aggressive, Aston Villa will destroy us if care is not taken tomorrow.
mosalah worlds best player
Poor attitude from Andrés García, when he gives the ball away for the first goal. Show some effort, man.
Darloss Nunez😢
watkins is a great player
Salah is obviously the best footballer in the world for this current 2024/2025 season. He always scores and assists as well.
You should show the two goals we scored that were offside.
The video doesn't show Watkins losing possession like a mug in the top right corner of the pitch which sets off the counter.
ASTON VILLA shouldn't be discarded in the Champs league
We got robbed absolutely. Our cancelled goals was not offside! Shame on that corrupt league and corrupt referees! But anyway we got 1 point, it is not a bad result. Hope we will get more good results soon. UTV
I thought I would see different rashford😢
Premier League nya siapaa.. Premier League nya siapaaaaaaaa....... Eeeeeee...ee.... ?????
Great tracking back by Rashford for the 2nd goal. Once a lazy git, always a lazy git. Villa fans will turn on him soon when they realize
good performances Rashford 💥
Youri's score is fantastic
Arsenal ❤❤❤🎉
Good point for Aston Villa
2:16 trent alexander  Arnold  playing  like right winger 😅😅😅 i don't  know  where is salah  that moment 😅
Same old Rashford, never charges forward, never tracks back, same mentality level. Should have left England for good.
If Rashford keep follow TAA, then the game should be Win of Villa.
1:30 ollie watkins  header is unbelievable 🔥 😳 🤎🩵
Must admit. Beginning to enjoy watching Villa play, and I am not a Villa supporter
Ok its done, from this week on Liverpool will start losing points and Man City will never lose again and win the league.
Am not a fan but Villa should have won this game easily
Why you can block Liverpool like this but can't even beat 10 men Ipswich??
Nunez 😢
Problem with rashford is he never track back to defend
#GGMU❤❤❤❤
0:17 what a assist by diago jota to mo salah  for the  one touch  finish 😊😊😊😊🤍🖤
Can we please get proper length highlights. Championship teams do 9/10 minutes. UTV 💜💙
Thank You Villa for Slowing Down Liverpool #Arsenal Fan
rubbish rashford
Handball
Why mingz....lol he is a league two defender
Rashford 3rd match and what??? Hahaha 😂😂😂 wend him to siberia with whole family
Trent need to start playing number 8
Nobody can stop salah from winning ballondr ❤
Mic Gin pissed me off he is slow to release the Ball
If no.9 (Rashford) tracks back fast,that TAA goal never happens. Small margins.
Am An Arsenal Man..But this CB Ming's Football IQ is Crazy.How is He even a Defender ffs
Liverpool is cracking now
Nunez 😂😂😂 we shuld have won this game
wp villa
Probably the right result but elements of good fortune for Liverpools goals, a gift and deflection.
The team is trash.
Rashford looks happier now …Rooney was right
Villa takes but also gives! You took 2 points from us (Arsenal) and now you gave them back. 😂 Thanks
😊thank for Núñez
Ole fooken Watkins mate
Darwin Nunez wouldn't have converted the first goal
thank Garcia for the draw
*ESKI RESHFORD😂*
The wheels are coming off for liverpool. They are starting to crumble and are losing the title.
Thanks villa from united fans
Champion league respect
If only Rashford and Malen scored those chances we would be sending off Livarpool to next season😂😂😂. What a beautiful ball and throwback to 2005-2007
That's what happened when played for Man U  Fans expecting him to tracks back  It wasn't easy to do so  And then he was always been the scapegoat  Fans hated Rashford ❌ Rashford hated fans ✅
why would slot bring of Trent
2nd goal of Liverpool could have been saved if Rashford had covered Trent. Amorim is right about Rashford.
Thanks!
Zlast ball of Liverpool is offside. Sala clear offside.
Typical trashford not tracking back
This guy where celebrating like the won the champions league
Please keep disasi villa..I will pay his transfer fee please I am begging you
Dawin Nunez must go
How Rashford smiles❤❤❤❤❤😘
Watkins is so effective. This draw shows how good Villa are. They deserve more ❤
Why is Rashford watching his man score lol
Aston Villa can thank Nunez for that draw game, Liverpool were the best side but Villa defended very well.
Arsenal fans lets gather here❤
Thanks vila for the draw 🎉🎉 fan of arsenal
Digne cross😮‍💨
Fine performance. It shows that why Aston Villa is in the seeded 8 of last 16 of UEFA Championship.
Salah great
⚽️⚽️⚽️🔥🔥
What a miss from darwin nunezz 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Just sell him 😅
I just don’t understand, how can you make such a mistake at this level , you clearly turn and see the liverpool shirt player and you kindly pass him the ball… YOU TAKE A GOOD LOOK AND GIVE HIM THE BALL!! This has to be match fixing.
Villa are always a pain in the neck for big teams
Giant killer Aston Villa.Last year they killed Arsenal.This time Liver6
Damn. that T90 ball is a pure beauty.
Thanks Liverpool footballers ALLAH protect you all
rashford 🤩🤩
Aston Villa you had only one job ( from an Arsenal supporter 😂😂😂 )
Why does the thumbnail looks like from PS5 ?!!?
Top 4 😂😂😂
Leave Rashford alone to play his football. Y'all united fans turning on him are becoming toxic. Just leave him alone.
Excellent cross from Digne. Makes the difference.
Nobody doubles up on Salah
Villa has great defender '' Darwin Nunez '' 💀
Villa park is a fortress.
the second goal was Rashford fault, he doesn't marking Trent
Thank you watkins😅😅
Salah stell MVP😁
Wish we coulda held on for the win, UTV
Liverpool is nothing without Salah
Nunez 😢

Villa, good job!
Thanks villains for the 2 pts👍❤️🤍
Excellent Goal From Tielemans And Ollie Watkins.   Aston Villa Shared Points Against Liverpool FC  In The Villa Park Stadium Score By 2-2. #AVLLIV.
Arsenal Fans Here : Thanks Villa ❤❤❤
12 vs 10. Darwin not play for us
Why the hell didn't Rashford track back and mark Trent? He easily could have got to him
Liverpool are not losers at all😊
bensin Liverpool sudah habis.
