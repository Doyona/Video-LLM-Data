GG! We loved making the music for this map reveal! Massive shoutout to the VAL fam and everyone involved 🖤🤙🏽
BROOOOO, just realized two of my mains (Iso and Clove) are in the same vid! Awesome!
Guard: The monster is here. (Starts shooting at Omen, right before he teleported behind him and willed a knife) Omen: Boo. Guard: (screaming to his death) Omen: Hmph. “Monster”. 2:18
2:50 guy really means : Overtime is ODINTIME
Loved the "All right lucky socks, don't fail me now!"
Omen hit a TF2 Spy reference on some npc
delete this map, how dare you riot
remove this map from the game
I literally ship all four of them as a family
This makes me wish there was a coop campaign
kuy
This is vyse
All purple theme
Cant wait for mobile 😮‍💨
BOO😂😂😂
2:21 normal for this map
Pushing mid with a spectre average iron lobby
atualizou um novo boneco
Grathear I Know Above Light Creatch Breathear Is The Greather Branch Greach We Secure Lighting Have To My Gather Dreach Gather Where I Now Because Help The Grathear
yo im p sure the knife omen has is the same one the guy from Episode 8 RECKONING tried to stab him with
Worst map
why are the character models so ugly in this trailer
3:14 VYSE
0:18 0:34 오멘 아까 장전했는데?
PVE?!
"im dodging"
3:14 THAT IS VYSE RIGHT?
My life was ruined 5 months ago
We want pve?
0:12 we need wansuers
The beginning is the end : Dark fans can relate 🤌
Boo😎
Worst Map after Fracture.
They uses different engine in this cinematic. It feels cheap yet entertaining
always get geeked with how this shorts show off the agents utils fr
Katelin Station
dogshitt map plain af
Jerald Gardens
imagine if this would be the real graphics in the game!
good
new agents vayse
aradığın türkçe yorum
why not just jump off the map in abyss
cool
Need more Cinematics like this. Could honestly watch a show about these three.
it s so cool
Noooooo! Iso got shooted😢😢😢
3:15 Vyse😮👀
Agent 8????? I hope so anyway
Make the teleport time shorter for omen
Danm I like it alot BEAUTIFUL JUST BEAUTIFUL IN JESUS NAME AMEN
I think it's interesting that Clove is using a gun in a way where it's clear they aren't trained to shoot... just a fun detail
Guys the Person in the Hourglass at the end is Vyse!!
me coming back realising they released vyse like idiots with the stray dhots
how is vandal tht much accurate
he finally did something on screen good for you omen
Now I'm looking at it the music at the end of Abyss trailer and Vyse trailer sound quite similar
Is this before or after omen left
Wish they had a pve game mode
bad map
Omen is HIM
wow müq
this MIGHT be the worst map since lotus
Tacticool-ly reloading after every 2 shots when one clip for each would be enough...
3:14 ZOMBIE MODE TEASE???? Would Be Awesome Tbh
nah bro its omens sis, the hands are the same lol
That "Boo" from Omen gave me chills
bro why do the new cinematic characters look kinda weird than the old videos.
omg i love this map
Vay amk iyi gaza geldim.
Judging by the last scene, a new character is coming
3:08
I believe the new agent will be revealed in this episode
dogshitest map ever
Remove or better delete the abyss mappppppp I just got -25rr because of you guys it was my rank up match to diamond idiottttttssss
Que demais esses efeitos 2D em meio ao 3D
hesab ba ban kiyye surun
so who's the bad side? Parallel Universe or The Hour glass?
Sorry but u hate abyss ajajajajajaa
"aLrIgHt LuCkY sOcKs, dOn't fAiL mE nOw!! 😃😃😃"
Yoooo omen waa smooth in this, iso not even flinching at the grenade was cold. Clove being the light of the emo group was hilarious
omen gives me "SCREAM" vibes
OMEN YAYYYYYYYYYYYYY
People keep speculating that the end is just the new character but idk, it looks a lot like Omen's hand to me, what if that's Omega Earth's Omen? I don't think we've seen him on the other side yet, right?
REMOVE THIS DOGSHIT MAP
If valorant devs are reading this pls fix the ingame esports update system cuz it doesn't provide update any time acc to that vct pasific stage 2 hasnt even started  and dont get me started on vct masters i love vct and sometimes i just love to watch brackets but cant cuz there is no update.  Pls fix it  Ps love valorant
Man Clove looks ugly
Bem que podia lançar um agente de portugal
Bro clove smoke was so weird
Its only me our everyone think coming soon have 1 more monster agent ?
Petition to remove Abyss in comp
esse mapa é um lixo, enfia esse mapa no cu riot
give viper back her snake bite
What is this music? 03:20
I HAVE A QUESTION: Why are these camera shaking movements at 2:51 ?
What was that at the last of video, new agent?
tiktogu olanlar "missipia" takip edebilir mi?❤
Update: worst map ever
GUZEL OYUN
Horrible map
Today almost my career is filled with abyss I hate abyss
kinda wish it was like protect the something while npc try to steal/break it while your team protects that something but it just turned into a underated to a swiftplay :/
Change the voice actor for clove, yuck
Worst map I’ve played
reyna's sister is here?
What was that at last , can somebody explain to me?
They werent talking about Omen when they said "the monster is here" NEW AGENT ALERT
new character !!!!!
New agent? 3:09
Wait whos tge kast oersin in this video? Omen? Or new char??
atp make a movie ffs
anybody notice iso only hiting headshots clove did risky things and omen being a pro stratagist by using ingame tricks
who r the yellow ones ?
Abyss is an abysmal map of epic proportions for 5v5. Riot is truly lost. Instead of fixing the smurfing/boosting and 1995 netcode they give us this disservice. Bottom shelf devs.
Don't let the people forget about the replay system, especially that riot always do..
W 🗣💯🔥 keep em updates coming!!!
Turkish halide is good <33 ♥
Bro 3:14 is like the new agent leaked
BRO There's a 26th character coming the one in the hibernation chamber
no
please make a update that u could convirt radinite points to valorant points
팀원들은 서로 뚤리게 가능한가요? 네온 칼픽한다고 렝에서 캐리하다가 4명이서 자꾸 저막은뒤에 화염으로 죽여서 이렇게문의해봅니다
something smells here
Wow! someone wants attention.
How do you buff Neon so hard and viper can't even lift the smoke on round now. Me quiero arrancar las greñas de los huevos
why window11 cant play?
zeltrax bro shoutout plzz
Anyone looking to buy valo id? I am selling my id worth 20k for 10k around as i dont play anymore anyone from india interested to buy?
Good map İ'm turkish
I like that the enemies here weren't actually incompetent. The tactics they used could believably work on regular people with guns  Only reason they failed is caused they weren't prepared for people with guns and superpowers
I love vandal
when will you guys fix the crashes bruh.
I hope they make a Valorant movie/series on Netflix
BOO
FIX YOUR CAPE TOWN SERVERS PLS, i love this game but it's unplayable because it keeps kicking me out and then giving me warnings for being afk😡🙄
valorant pls upgrade omen 🥲🥲
This was the best cinematic yet...its so good, the graphics the story the powers. Valorants back baby!!
why am i suspended  is it my lack of boundaries? others didn't seem to care when i made mine very clear
How to balance duelists: (since youre only making them un-fun)  Revert all nerfs to jett dash  Revert all nerfs to raze satchel  Add a dash to reynas dismiss(you almost did this!!)  Yoru is fine and strong. Duelists should win their gunfights.  Somehow make phoenix viable (honestly just add a dash to the flash)  Iso is incredibly strong with the recent changes and does not need a dash because shield.  Neon is nice, but give her 2nd stun back to compensate for other duelist buffs.
Valorant mobile: ? Where will it be available? When will it come out?
Riot games equals bunch of stupid a.holes - change my mind
Ihr habt jetzt alle meine 9 Accounts verloren aus eurem game. Ich hab immer ordentlich rein gezahlt aber diese scheiße gebe ich mir nicht mehr.  Die neue map ist absoluter Dreck und der ISO Buff ist so ein absoluter Missklick. Welchen dummen Azubi habt ihr denn da ran gesetzt? Wie kann man den bitte so stark machen? Dieses Spiel regt einen nur noch auf. Dieses Spiel ist der absolute Mist geworden. Löscht euch bitte selber, ich hab den Anfang gemacht mit meinen ganzen Accounts.
I just noticed they teased Iso's Double-Tap change with this. 2:02 he gets the kill and the orb appears, but in the next scene he take a nade and you hear the broken shield noise. Rito with the subtlety.
This update not good
Vote for ios release
hesabımı çaldılar nolur yardım edin riot  yemin ederim çalındı
Welp new agent fr
0:32 he reloaded full mag? xd
what is this end ????
for a movie company, riot makes pretty good games!!!
That's kinda funny, riot nerfed/buffed based on how popular agent was not by balancing. If some agent very popular in tournament be ready NERF GOES BRRR
Will I be compensated for this cyber incident? And I want the 10 R point
Will I be compensated for this cyber incident? And I want the 10 R point
SIR PLS ADD REPLAY
i need rioy gun buddy😢pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee
WHERE IS THE WARSAW SERVER?????
Riot, please fix your game for god sakes. It’s so annoying getting disconnected randomly and fighting remakes on top of that
I am form india and today is 18th of june and i am trying to open valorant and the server of the valorant is just unbearable it show of val 84 val 68 network error fix this issue or else i am leaving this game forever and also it shows this error when we are playing this is just unbearable also i am getting ban for this several time this is just not right
The game crashed. Fix it pls.
Valorant should make a movie featuring all their agents
error van 84 fix please...
pls omen buff +1 smoke or taller c
@Valorant, why the game is so buggy in the new map????
hey, valorant i love the game
why valorant crash??
Valorant fix ur game
clove no you are not
still doesn't help with the running rampant predators in my games, oh well. And I get muted because i call out these pedos... oh well.
Make console crossplay with pc pls
This is so unrealistic... Clove (they/them) could not shoot through their(They/them) own smoke. They/them defgfinetnintninly has some sort of wallhack/aimbot
nerf iso
who do we think was in the ice at the end?
would be fun to watch with a "Replay System" how some would die falling off lol
new agent coming up?
force buy ahh trailer
😡I DONT UNDERSTAND, IF I HAVE A GOOD INTERNET THAT ALLOWS ME TO PLAY ANY GAMES WITHOUT PROBLEMS, THEN IN VALORANT, WHEN I FOUND THE GAME, THE GAME GOES 1000 YEARS, AFTER WHICH I GO TO PLAY THE MATCH, AND LOOK AT MY PENALTY FOR 1 HOUR!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!? I JUST DOWNLOADED THIS GAME AGAIN, WHY DO I HAVE IT?! 1 HOUR WAITING TIME!?!?!?!!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I CAME HERE TO PLAY!!!

Is the last thing at the map trailer possibly agent 8?
cringe af

VALorant delet chamber att this point iso is just tanking my whole ult >:(

100% SHATTER IT LOOKS SO LIKE HIM AND ITS AN CANCELED AGENT
yo can you fired man who thinks to give iso unlimited shield its a good idea dowgs

Hey valorant can you buff astra and sage please because they feel like they dead
hü iz redi för ovartime

New Agent
XBOX then movie
Pit breach in one of the cinimatic
call this glaze but that omen tp peak and them overall referencing actual in-game strategies and utility was so smart and well thought out to me. they could have made iso just activate his shield normally but instead the animators decided to make him shoot an orb to evade the grenade
01:35 report Clove for trolling as she threw her Spectre over a pistol
2:30 can anyone give him some gavanized square steels??
clove looks like she was designed by an 8 year old
someone tell me whose hand it is at 3:14? reyna?
Pls fix bug in abyss
i wanna win--please
This is just OMEN showing off trailer .
patch iso is broken
Always copying from cs try to create something new and original
"Boo." "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" best part ngl
I see they're plannin on adding  a NEW MONSTER AGENT SOON 🤔🤔
they gotta stop depicting omen abilties like that or else update him to be invulnerable as soon you pop off a move. i actually think it would make a lot of out play potential.
Iso getting a shield without any kill plus unlimited shields is absolutely busted. Riot you're trash bro
They really made this mario
Can u buff sage healing little bit  plZzz Iso and reyna buff is too much to handle
Maybe A female Monster Character incoming AWESOME🤩🤩
vertigo V2
bro new agent in end?
1:20 tp de info é canônico/info tp is Canonical
Monster is coming... dayum that was epic... On top when the bullets ripped his hand, but omen was teleported.. omen is love ❤
worst game of all time <3
The quality of the animation is definitely a step down the usual for these cinematic trailers. I hope that trend doesn't continue, as I enjoy watching them a lot :(
missing the game cause i am unable to play it now cuz of my father
Can you stop making map dear riot...
this is literally vertigo
Irony I was One tap with specter today clove has hacks on lol
This is pretty good since fade one
Nerf neon
We want a game mode about pve killing those bots!
I love this map please include this map in competitive match
No more jumping off B site tower ok Split to suicide, C side on Haven.
Can't wait for another new agent. With 3 blinds, 2 smokes, and an ult that instakills anyone anywhere on the map, but it's a sentinel.😂
PLEASE make a netflix series
OHHH IS THE GUY IN THE BLUE CRYSTAL SOMEONE RELATED/SIMILAR TO OMEN???
Nah Omen the GOAT watching over the rookies is cool
my spectre could never.
This gave me an idea for a PvE hourglass mode.
I can't wait to alt f4 every time this map comes up cause it's trash also if u could fix the rank system that would be nice I'm tired of playing against golds and plats while I'm only silver
Medic! heavy is dead
wish my spectre did that
So where ignoring the new agent
Give Raze pre-nerf satchel speed back!
RIP Replay system comments 😢
the cinematic is prettyier without CGI but always good
you guys should add qa zombies mode that just sends waves of "zombies" at the players each round and they ramp up in difficulty like first round is pistols and like ten "zombies"
No one is going to talk about the end with the hand that looks like Omen's?
imagine this as a gamemode, player versus AIs
What was the creature in the end??
We need a tv show
hey anyone know what are acronym AJ and VX in the coordinates in the beginning of the video ?
Yo RIOT ... you need to change the map pool and actually rotate abyss IN !the old map pool is the one we r getting🙂
3:11 can we talk about this? Release the new champ riot, now! Ty.
its a literal map designed for omen enjoyers
When pve mode?
3:10 New Agent???
When I TP like that as omen i wake up dead
Wow, that's pretty cool.It's just cool, it's cool.wooooooooow I adore you The game is super good cool And cool magic🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍
1:46 Clove use wallhack
There so many places to fall off of it triggers my trypophobia
발로란트 관계자님 이맵좀 수정좀해주세요 떨어져도. 아래서죽여서. 어떻게해야하는 지 이것을 좀 고쳐주세요
Where is the ping limiter of CS GO ???? Valorant hu ?? just asking. Bc the guy who come on other server for ping advantage need to K '/ $
wow
Where is the ping limiter of CS GO ???? Valorant hu ?? just asking. Bc the guy who come on other server for ping advantage need to K '/ $
Make a story mode pls
Unpopular thought Hope one day we get valorant campaign
Put Pearl Back.
When valorant mobile release😅
Looks like the Vault of Glass raid from Destiny 1 back in 2014
Add practice mode like csgo2
NEW AGENT AT END????
Just being out the anime show already
Just bring out the Netflix show already
im a simple person, i see clove i be happy
So we not gonna talk about the new guy behind the blue glass
That teaser at the end.... <3
Is that a glimpse of new agent at the end of this trailer?
I can finally play with my homeboys on Xbox
Agent 7, or am I wrong?
valorant the ui for the buy hud is trash, way too big just ego back top how it was. And also how the game looks it is blinding my eyes i have everything on the lowest settings but all colors are soo much brighter, pls make a setting that u can turn that off pls :(
They should add a pve mode where you capture abyss from hourglass
Can you guys add a new agent named Rey and the abilities are driving a taxi?
New agent 😮
New agent sneak peak in the end ???
this map is freaking big and confusing tbh
first thing me and the homies did when we got queued into this map was jump off first round. was fun, many laughs. 10/10
yo whats that at the end
So the new agent is teased as well woohoo
Omen alwasy get shot 🤣🤣
After playing it  .. quite a cool map 😮
Oooooo a hint for a new character 🎉
omen was going insane
You make openworld game pls
Hermoso!!!!
Wondering why they didn’t name sunset “sunshit” because not only is ranked match making bad but so is that map on ranked
one style of game play that is it.
in the last scene this hand either for reyna or a new agent coming soon
i dont understand this map
3:10 is that new agent or what??
Overwatch Ahh Map FR
Who is in the last scene guys
are fracture and pearl still gonna be out of comp???
Most w Update a Video Game firm has ever droped
im going ti reintal it tonight after like one year
Ilove cloves little horns
It would be cool if the maps had AI bots each team has to "kill" to reach an objective. MAKE IT HAPPEN RIOT
The graphics in the cenematics are a little off but the concept itself is amazing
new agent locked up in cryosleep
Guys anyone help me unban my account my riot client crashed suddenly several times in a match
Made in Abyss ahh map
Y'all forgot the replay system 😢
NERFA ESSA NEON PELO AMOR DE DEUS! BUFARAM ELA SEM NECESSIDADE NENHUMA! JÁ ERA ROUBADA, E VCS FAZEM UMA CAGADA DESSA
Wait what was that at 3:14 Is that a new upcoming agent? Or is he just for the lore?
I'm waiting for Valorant mobile 😢
Valorant mobile crying at corner 🥲
Yayyy now neon is OP it's unplayable thanks
I would really like to know where my money is going. What's with the quality of the animation.
Very tricky map
LETS GO!
new carrecter coming soon i think
are we getting a fricking rocket launcher ?
Yo a new agent got teased at the end. Really wonder if they’ll finally add a melee agent
The animation got worse :(
Hey riot, did Tencent give you a Map idea from their game? Yes an actual fps shooter playable game release very long time ago (before the League even come out). It's might hard to know what i saying, but I bet someone made this must be CF players, Cross Fire. The map very similar with "Deport Station" on Cross Fire (eng version). The first time i look on it, I already know you guy just bring back may favourite map.
i love clove as a female character
제가발로란트가계속멈춰서영구정지를당했습니다이건저희컴퓨터문제가아니라유튜버분들도발로란트가멈춘다고고쳐달라했지만고쳐주시지못해서영구정지를당했습니다이걸풀어주시고고쳐주세요
My goodness! Cinematics always give me goosebumps! TT//////TT I can't believe there's another map so soon! So nice.
I m right now updating this version

Wish they have a 3v3 mode
where replay system?

0:26 why does she looks like a rat ? whats wrong with her nose
3:12 is that Omen, Agent 8 or someone completly different?
IS THAT A NEW HERO?? 3:33
In the end was a new agent i think
i prefer aries over spectre, this video was amazing i wanna see more of clove
챔피언스 노래 느낌이 나는데 호오호오 너무 기대됨
3:09 new agent teaser
i hope this map is a night map😎😎
One side there is Toxic players all over the lobby which makes me leave Valorant, and the other side is the cinematic lore which makes me like Valorant again
Great map to be bullied to jump and get banned for a year
valo was peak until clove
please make a film
As someone who mained Clove and Iso for the weeks after they released, and recently started learning Omen, I feel like that was a great matchup.  The map looks very interesting.
OMG LOVIN THIS!!!
i see... OMEN inverse... IMEN.
looks like the next agent is a monster, from omens comment about a monster to the claws at the end. im excited
new agent?
the thing in the end... Agent number 08? maybe xD
imagine a  valo movie..i hv been requesting it since 3 years now
thats awsome, well done guys
Ok, but give us Haven back
new agent ? 3:08 ?
Awesome trailer!! So...? i make this 'Delicious Version' :D
Anyone knows about the end score???
They fr had 2 afks on their team, i feel them

Podrían meter algún mapa con lluvia🎉
3:13 new agent?
The no boundaries concept is crazy and also really liked the possible hint of a new agent shown at the end
Am I the only one who is getting a fishy smell of an upcoming new agent in this video 🥴
Amazing gameplay🎉 thanks❤

We Want Valorant Mobile  Love from India 🇮🇳
👍🏻
Cant wait to dodge this map 🤣
This map is epic just played it not to long ago and i cant believe it, definitely something to get used to but further it's fantastic and i enjoyed myself jumping off every time we won and hearing teammates laugh, funniest part is scarring the enemy team and they fall off😂😂
umarım iyidir
the sites look like CS2 but the map gives the feel of COD
bros adsing with a spectre
2:22 GUYS HE SAID THE THING!!!
was that a teaser for a new agent at the end ?????????????????
OH MY GOD YES
At last new agent

Thats Good About That.
zhdite suchki skoro vernus' i vseh raz'ibu
Clove is a horribly designed character, she looks like a actual child
Every 1: omen whif Noone : talking bout clove smoking was 🔥✨
like a night mode map
i have a theory that the new agent is going to be a yeti hybrid considering the fact you can see fur
new agent already?
anyone else notice the end where theres a image of  a hand??? but it looks like omens
cmon how did omen missed the knife kill ( 2:25 )

Well this is lit 🎇
can't believe Valorant, they put clove in cinematics so she might die a lot in them and they wont even care because she is immortal.  😑
Girly sounds like Merida from brave i love it!
Hey Valorant staff! I love the game, I'm new player. But please fo something about the lobbies. Yesterday i literally had to play with an immortal. Lobbies have been ridiculous, I only get way higher players and I'm not able to enjoy. Starting to give up. Love from Hungary.

People lagging are going to rubber band and fall into the abyss
Cross play para consola PC no nos merecemos que nos de menos
teasing new character as well gg riot <3
imagine your teammate falling of with the spike xD
my theory is that potential agent at the end could be agent 8 if you look at the hourglass it looks like number 8 maybe riot trying to give us hint all this time also clove has a voiceline for agent 8 maybe its about time for riot to do something about that mysterious agent
Can we get our Valorant Anime already?
retuns heaven pls 🙏🙏
Seems like a fun map. Hopefully it lives up to its potential and cool unique plays you could do!

did anyone notice the end part there with the silhouette of a person? new agent…?
That boo was hilarious
Agent 8?? 👀
This is the first not 10/10 trailer in a while. I wonder if the team had a change in staff..
3:14 agent teaser?
woah DoctorFreeze Omens fake clone , they used it in cinematic
new character?
omen did the omen clone 💀
Who’s that guy at the end 👀
Idk wtf that was at the end but im excited. Wonder what they'll be all about, assuming thats the next agent
All i see: New map Clove got a ace Iso got 3k maybe 4k Omen MISS a knife kill
Clove sounds like a girl to me
🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
Best trio ever 🎉
if only the spectre actually killed someone that fast or easily with a headshot.....
I'm currently edging to this map rn
Bring back Haven
Is the "beast" at the end the guy who's locker used to be 8?.. I wonder🤔
A anime for val would go crazy like cmon
New character pointed!
it looks like a fan made animation. clove looks awful
New agent ?!
Why do the models look weirder than from the cinematics
Is no one gonna talk about 3:10? It looks like an agent teaser
Cant wait for riot to remove the map after 2 weeks, never bring it back,  and then continue to make valorant boring
Omen sounds kinda goofy
Resembles Vertigo from Counter Strike
Enough! We want Valorant mobile
Clove looks ugly af even in this cinematic
When It Is Coming Out?
1:23 one of the coolest thing in valorant
''The beginning of the end'' was too cold
That last part does it foreshadows another new agent or is it omen is that crystal.
I wish RIOT sponser me a PC
I wish i had teammates like them
we gonna love the breach ult
Okay, so Vertigo is on Valorant!
Breach mains are gonna love this
Wish Jett got back her two updrafts again.. could make good use of it here
Until now I still haven't touched or used clove
How did they dare assume the gender of the enemies ?
Vertigo.
The map is a knockoff of Vertigo from CS. Instead of Boost will able cross with NEON, OMEN JETT, YORU.
amazing cinematic as always riot. kudos. i loved seeing all of their abilities
animators incorporating actual in game tricks into canon mechanics that the agents themselves use is really cool
new character ? in box ?
Wouldve been better if they give Iso a guardian since mfs in competitive do be auto hs when they crouch with iso.
tf happened to animation quality?
New agent on the last scene?
wow
A seminar about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s forced organ harvesting crimes was held at the Tianmen Gallery in Paris, France on October 21, 2023.  David Matas, a renowned human rights lawyer from Canada, shared his decades of investigation into this ongoing horrific crime that has Falun Gong practitioners as the major victims. He said that fighting for human rights is the responsibility that everyone should try their best to take on.   David Matas giving the talk during the seminar  The Investigation Back in March 2006, a Chinese woman, Annie (alias), published a statement in Washington D.C. She said that her ex-husband, a surgeon at the Sujiatun Hospital in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, had disclosed to her that he had removed cornea from 2,000 living Falun Gong practitioners between 2002 and 2005. Other doctors in the hospital also removed other organs from more practitioners. These victims were killed in the process and their bodies were cremated to destroy the evidence. The organs were sold to wealthy Chinese or foreigners who were in China for transplant tourism.  A non-government organization in Canada contacted David Matas and the late David Kilgour, former Secretary of State for Asia Pacific, inviting them to conduct an independent investigation into this matter.   After months of investigation, they published a 140-page report in July 2006, which drew “the regrettable conclusion that the allegations are true.” They also found that the atrocity didn’t only take place in the hospital Annie’s ex-husband worked for, but in many other hospitals across China.  The Evidence Matas said, when they did the investigation, they looked for evidence that either supported the existence of the crime, or evidence that indicated the crime wasn’t happening. Every piece of evidence they found all pointed to the same conclusion – organ harvesting is happening.   In their investigation, they interviewed Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners who were held in various detention centers or prisons in China. They found that these Falun Gong practitioners went through extensive physical examinations, especially blood tests and tissue typing. This wasn’t for their health, as most of them were also subjected to savage beating and other torture. From their description, the examination was mostly likely used to build a database for organ matching. At the same time, the authorities only performed such examinations on Falun Gong practitioners, not any of the non-practitioners held in the same detention facilities.  One Falun Gong practitioner who was tortured in a Chinese prison and underwent involuntary blood test recounted the experience during the seminar.  While the real number of organ transplants is a state secret in China, just based on the limited numbers published by the CCP, it can be seen that organ transplant numbers significantly increased soon after the persecution of Falun Gong began. The CCP claimed that the organs came from donation, but China didn’t have an organ donation system and it’s also against the Chinese tradition to donate one’s organs after death.   As another piece of evidence, some investigators pretended to be patients and they called various hospitals, asking whether they had fresh Falun Gong organs available, as Falun Gong practitioners had very a healthy lifestyle, unlike other inmates who may be addicted to smoking or drugs. The answer they got from the doctors was, “Yes, we have these organs, just make an appointment and come.”  Some Chinese hospitals listed prices for various organs and one can make an appointment for the transplants of vital organs, including heart and liver.   In China, there was a law that gives hospitals permission to extract organs from death row prisoners without their or their family’s consent. This furthers greenlights the organ harvesting crimes, which has evolved into a massive, lucrative industry.  The CCP never admitted that they harvested organs from living Falun Gong practitioners. They claimed that the organs came from donation of death row prisoners, who wanted to make up for their wrongdoings. But the number of death row prisoners was far less than the transplants.  In 2014, the investigation team conducted another round of research. They went to the websites and publications by 169 individual Chinese hospitals approved by the government to conduct transplants and collected data regarding transplant types performed, qualifications, revenue, potential patient demographics, bed counts, surgical and support personnel, transplant capacity and volume, research projects, relationships with other hospitals and related entities, funding, patents, and awards.  They estimated that the total transplants performed by these hospitals were between 60,000 and 100,000 every year, far more than the 10,000 transplants per year claimed by the CCP. And the numbers seemed to keep increasing over the years. If this is true, the numbers of Falun Gong practitioners being “executed” on operation tables could add up to millions.  Matas said, “What I can tell you is that everyone who has read these books (of our investigation) and done their own research has, without exception, come to the same conclusion that we have. As the China Tribunal has said, this is undoubtedly sensible and this is real.”  He added: “Because I am Jewish and I am very familiar with the Holocaust, I am not shocked by the extraordinary symptoms of violence. I see it. I know it is possible. I am disappointed and I see it happening.”  Stop the Crime Matas said that in order for such a massive killing network to exist, there must be a large number of criminals that make it happen, including the doctors, nurses, transplant agents or any other individual assisting in the crime. All of them should be brought to justice.  “It’s hard for us to change what’s happening in China. But we are human beings. So this is still about us. It’s important that everyone wakes up and spreads the word in their own capacity.”   “Each of you has your profession, your skills, your connections and your neighbors. Each of you can do something that I cannot. Human rights is something we all need to try our best to fight for,” Matas said.  A law professor who attended the seminar said to Matas, “I must express my admiration for your work. It’s just great! I hope more people can know about this.”
ermmmm this looks abit like vertigo 🤔
Is the end a agent teaser????
i cant wait for bug lol
ooooooooooo THis map looks like lotus and ascent mixed together. 3:13 Is that a nex agent or something?

No way that Omen has inhuman friend now
3:10 no way its agent 8
please jus bring back haven for the love of god
1:52 bro is x-ray💀

Not gonna lie yall doing too much now, like nobody just hitting head shots with the specter like that. Also everyone using no abilities but omen is crazy work . Man’s can’t even see straight
Let's see how this is gonna be...
Why this video is in 21:9 resolution but the game does not support this resolution? I wanna play valorant but black bars on the sides are disgusting.
Maybe theres upcoming new agent i hope so😢
Omen is probably the most badass character in the entire game
So if u can fall that mean yoru tp will fall too
Worst map after accent let's go
We need heaven back 😇
what's up with the end do we get another new agent?
Valorant can you fix if someone is afk in the first round you should give them 1 month band in valorant

We got de_vertigo in Valorant before GTA6
What would be the new agent. Duelist i guess
Is this for comp
W
Last scene its new agent ???
The knife kill, u serious? 💀
Clove's first cinematic <3
so the screen when i open the game is the peek of new map ?
3:15 what's that?
2:28  Little Omen works hard to buy a 1 square meter house and can not sleep in any way so he had an idea to redesign it like this. Use galvanized square steel and borrowed screws from Killjoy and cover it with eco friendly wood veneers so he could missed his knife kill.
‏‪3:16‬‏  i hope this is good
‏‪3:16‬‏  i hope this is good
Dude the animation is sick
Iso in trailers: super hype Iso in game: potato
RIP replay system comments.
cool trailer but map looks horrible
Is the New agent in the last?
We need more story line
A new character is coming.... 😍
It's high time for Valorant to make a series
3:14 New hero reveal😍
1:23 did bro just jump peak with tp 😭
A map with no boundaries is a nightmare for yoru lmao
Our new agent is Norwegian?! Judging from the coordinates from the beginning 70°50'N 9°00'W is a volcanic island called Jan Mayen located in Norway. I wonder what abilities they could have 👀
Yo lore be expanding
Radiant entertainment 2.0 ?????

Pisti pud ning mapaha
1:23 🔥
this literally gives throwers a better opportunity to throw by jumping off the map
new agent too?🫣👀
I cant wait to see all my opponents just jump and die
i cant wait for all of that parkour training with neon and the parkour area in the range to come to use! im so exited for this map lol
Ain’t no way they got Warwick in this game
Woooah<3
is no one talking about the new agent teaser at the end of the film
Cant wait to dash off the map
i wonder how the map will look like in the replay system
It’s funny that omen’s ultimate only needs 1 kill to use
Bring haven and fracture back to comp queue
Please bring back old maps
Agent 8 is that you ?!!!!
omen
yo riot add button or yo u can remove barrier bro pls
BOO.
Map looks great, I like the detail at the 30 second mark when they all reload at a different time so at least one of them can shoot if they get attacked. Omen missing the knife then the guard falling is amazing
MID
Wait is that agent 08 at the end
Is there any new agent to come with the new map?? Becuz at last they showed something which is unreal 😳
Should've made it a PvE map, just sayin
So those last shots are the one to blame for the new agent release in the future ? Humm...
Why not show the map instead of having a pointless animation
I wish they had blood on.
For everyone wondering, I did some research and I'm pretty sure it's based on an Island in the Norwegian Sea located in the north of Iceland and East of Greenland. The name of the Island is Jan Mayen.
When is the release date?
URE TRASH
F**** off 1:25 this thing can't happen in valorant scammers. GLITCHES GAME
A map with parkour now you're speaking my language
mais um lixo
RIOT GAMES!!!!! GIVE ME THE VALORANT CONSOLE CLOSED BETA, AND MY LIFE IS YOURS.
The vertigo of valorant
worse than icebox,  as an competitive player, there so so many places to camp and makes the game so bad.
Was that a new agent at the end or am i tripping?
THIS IS WHY I MAIN OMEN WTF
im not gonna lie this is a dumb concept
meh
will there be a new agent bcs of the end
w map
What happened to the animation team"??
I already hate it , so many angel's to clear .
I wish they would make a campaign you can do with 5 friends or a solo. that way you can get more of these cute clips
Keep it up, Valorant. proving better with each update.
Oo new agent teaser? At the end
New agent?
bro i need that rocket launcher one of the guards had asap!

0:27 - sooooooooooo cringe face...
Omen what was THAT knife bro 😔
Bro the omen tech was crazy at 1:20 🔥
imagine we get a launcher as the next new weapon
New agent?? New map??
what is that thing at the end of the vid?
Valorant needs a Netflix series these cinematics are good
midas waiting room
Breach back to s tier lesgoo
can't wait for a valorant series
Kinda feels like fracture
I love the new agent hint in the trailer
Clove VA… I love you eternally
when can we play this map on PBE?
Y'know, i personally think that next again should have south indian origin.
is that clove just pressing "space" and "G" at the same time? why throw the gun ?
Everybody talking about how good some agents gonna be on this map but, is the last part hinting towards another agent?(I dunno I might be completely wrong)
What is that character design, looks terrible
When map is coming?
2:23 good knife omen but it was hilarious bes boo i ever seen

omen clone canon?
Meanwhile iso still has a stupid ult
A new aganet in the end of the video ? or what ?

Jason Marnocha KILLED IT AGAIN 🔥
new agent spoiler from japan...nice...
ha! nice try but you can't replace haven for me.
1:23 why is no one talking abt the fact that they added the omen fake tp into this cinematic
Iso is such a cool man lol
Classic ranked comp: Clove, Omen, Iso and the instalock jett and reyna rage quit
Nah omen can’t be silver+, reloads after not even firing any bullets
3:11  new agent???
This map looks great !

Looks like this is the new fracture. Could be better, might be worse
guaranteed half my teammates falling off every round
insta dodge

Omen cinematic go hard
oh my god really want new agent Oo
1:47 is reference to Freekill (right) and Psycho (left) from flashdeckanimations.

bruh i am gonna be lost
So are we getting a new agent next act?
lets be real that one jump around the wall is straight out of vertigo bruh
Is that a hint for a new agent too??? 3:15 🧐🤔
1:24 what omens mains think they look like when they fake tp into a jiggle
who asked
WE DON'T NEED NEW MAPS. JUST GIVE US THE OLD MAPS RIOT. 🥺🥺
who asked
okay another new agent is coming??the very last scene means that to me
So I'm guess the map is Platform heavy base and good for dash/teleporting agents.
Omg a map that is totally different from the other I'm so excited
Didnt pay attention first time i saw this. Wish we had a replay system
valorant should add a storyline
Clove reloads with the same mag. 1:51
I love watching everything about this game, except playing it 😂
A wise omen once said : "Boo"
Low elos gonna love this
Dogshit MAP , 0:27 bad cgi , corny af , taser for an over powered hero. 1.5B revenue to get the most dogshit responses and no updates
smokedancer teaser at the end there i bet
THE LAST BIT?? OH???
replay system
im expecting on a new agent :00
The map is going to get more kills than enemy(Its a whole obby)
HE ACTUALLY DID THE FAKE OMEN TRICK WTF YOOOOO
Important--" Add a( kick )mechanism in game... So that we can kick players off map.... It will be soo fun" . And it's other use would be... If u are very close to enemy in gun fight.... U can kick him... - for a push back.. And... Restset his aim❤... This... Is not in CS2 and will make our game different and more fun
3:10 new agent ?
New Agent??
some sort of armored girl will be the next valorant agent mark my words!

Indoor map lets goooooo
huh.... they changed the style of animation? sic
Muy real dando hed  a traves del humo
As a breach main, the enemy team is gonna hate me so much more after i ult the whole site and knock all of them off cliff
Am I the only one who thinks the quality of the art and cinematic rendering has gotten worse?
the quality drop is noticibale btw. we need to pretty val cinematics >:(
Small map for a 5v5. Feel like 2 maps are possible to make out of that one. Sure, Breeze left but this already arrived.
we need more omen in cinematics
Oh I think its replay system
riot can we get a survival mode with 25 waves! and wave 5,10,15,20 is mini boss  than  wave 25 is big boss clone agent with big health!
Agent 8 reveal????
bro is bazooka is coming to valorant
Bro, No one's talking about the omen jiggle peek? that's smooth asf.
exicted
What was that in the ending? Is there a new agent awakening? Or perhaps a monster that helps out in hunting anything down
sxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
3:15 new agent?
Sick! I can't wait to dodge it.  Real talk though, the falling off the map gimmick is interesting sure but, most players don't even know the minimap exists, therefore lacking any map awareness, so I'll probably be doing 3v5 because 2 of my teammates fell off the map
2:26 proof omen has happiness still in him
Can't wait for Valorant BR mode
1:01 hey that picture is the signal that the new 26th agent coming?
so, no one is going to say anything about the character in the case like there isn't a new character coming out
You guys cooked with this teaser HOLY
id love for "generic cinematic soldier guy" to be an agent in valorant
3:10 new agent?
0:50 If anyone has played BGMI, then this map reminds me of "the library map" which opens only on friday in TDM only
1:23 OMEN DID THE FAKE TP. AHAHHAAHHAHHAHAHA
Omen is the real gamer like us reloads after shooting one bullet
For first time we got same agent from parallel universe @VALORANT  i know what you cooking
Bro really went for the knife 💀💀
Does anyone feel that the music at the end of the video is very fiery?
Clove is so spunky I love it 😎
Who was in the ice , in the end 🙂
new Agent Leak
drfreeze tp
character teaser as well lets goooooo
What is this goofy ahh animation
I think in the end part the guy shown is agent 8
The map is no different from the others even in terms of palette. Riot Games stopped trying. Nothing new except that you can die on your own. How can you create such rubbish with such a budget
Anyone else see omen reload twice without shooting a bullet? 0:16
Omg that fake tp from omen to spot enemy...
CANT WAIT MY ENTIRE TEAM DIED IN THE DEATH PIT
Finally a map where there would be no cypher pick rate 😊
Naah man that fake omen tp was brutal, the enemy didn't stand a chance...
like why can yall only make bad maps this should not be in the comp game mode at all
New update : Specter 1 shot headshot 160 damage
Bro I want more
i think it would be cool to add a deadpool into game, a character who breaks the fourth wall in games
And another master animation
So what if Jett holds the spacebar to fall down slowly?
1:22 Fake TP MENTIONED
wait is the last clip teeser for new agent?
Their looking for the replay system
new gun?? rocket launcher
Finally a map like Vertigo. Let's go, RIOT!!!
Deadlocks country is beautiful ❤
In almost every cinematic they all have been looking for aswers, since like 4 years and we still got nothing
I haven't been hyped like this for so long😢😢
Omen fake tp is crazy
New agent at the end?
apa nanti divalo bisa mati karna jatuh, kyk scene musuh omen jatuh waktu mau dipisoin
2:41 can it be a new rocket launcher
2:24 omen think he the spy
new map and new agent
Thts agent 8!!!!
so we can finally die off the map now let's gooo
New agents?
I miss the replay system comment
Sheeeesh
why does this animation look like it was made by someone from fiver for 5$ ?
is it me or is Omen bad ?
it looks terrible... another hallway simulator
OMG IM SO EXCITED 🫶🫶❤️❤️❤️
agents voice lines r so cringy eww
no one talk about omen fake tp ?
1 kill reload   Yes
A new agent huh. Interesting
SO FRICKIN AWESOME !!

Fix your ranked matchmaking
Animation quality 10/10 smoke quality 5/10
who's hand was it in the last scene ....new agent?
THIS IS GONNA BE SO FREAKING FUN I HOPE THIS WONT GET CANCLED
Can we get an animated tv show from Valorant already
c pas propice au jeu bas oui tu disparait avec omen tu te prend la balle dans le jeu et pas dans ds la cinematique et bas oui tu jette l'arme  pour sauter
but omen is not a monster 🥺
The hourglass is so distinct, I think the new agent is bending time.
hand at the end the missing agent?!?!?!?11//?!!]!
New champion?
My team is gonna die on all the jumps
soooo was that a hint at a new weapon and new character?!
MY MAN OMEN GETTING THE HYPE HE DESERVES IN THIS TRAILER
What's the music?
3:14 omen's dad has been awaken ☠️
I can't wait to play this map and see the new agent riot cooking rn
3:12 New Agents
Is the music at the end of the trailer published ?
Now people can finally E-Date on Vertigo ✨💅
I think there will be a new agent
Stares at a couple of books that look like they were bought at BN the week before. "These texts are ancient ..."
3:15 Is that the teaser of the new Agent?
cant wait for my team stacking one site on defense and getting enemy team in our spawn!
toooooo many angles to clear again :(
i think i am the one who loved with music 3: 19
Omen fake TPing in a cinematic is wild
woaw🎉
Map is kinda cool, but overall cinematic kinda lame. But the map concept is nice - finally something funny to mess with :)
is new agent coming?
Can’t wait for the next video.
2:25 Bro missed
New map revealed and possible new hero coming soon to
1:27 OMG OMEN FAKING THE TP IS SO BADASS
1:25 - omen pulled a doctor freeze
when does this release
anyone noticed about the last part in hourglass could be a new agent or something related to hourglass universe?  What our opinion guys
CAnt wait to get rawdogged on the rope
Daaang , this movies are just getting better and better every time
oooohh so that's how you use clove i seee lmaoo
Very poor video quality. Usually the videos are much better shot and look better. This video looks like machinima.
YORU TELEPORT
1:50 i was expected clove to said "Here, Catch!"
i love everyone is speaking one liner and not normal conversation 😂
just bring the older maps
I think new Agent will come soon
3:08 Is this the missing aganet no. 8??😮😮
Is that mirror world omen in the hour glass at the end?
3:08 hourglass?
Go watch made in abyss
Is that last part hind for new agent?
at the ending of the video who is it? A new character?
is it only me or the animation changed? Like look at the sunset reveal trailer and this one, the sunset one just looks so much better and like they used to in comparison to this one. what happened?
blur studios trailers and videos are so much better
I'm not seeing any Yoru in these cinematics lately..
3:15 new agent teaser🧐😮‍💨
Is that bazoka?
3:13 quite creepy , is it new agent?
Okie
I feel so bad for omen :< the way he went "heh, monster" i could tell he felt hurt
I'm Ready for that Big Red DEFEAT logo
Novo agente 😃e novo mapa
Omen cinematic again? Love it. My man deserves the spotlight
Imen scenes carry every animation
So finally you can do parkour with real risk of falling off the map
Spectre buff?
Tdm map?
VORFREUDE 🎉
3:11 Jeez, new agent!
The fake shrouded step 😍😍😍
THIS IS SICK.
How much do you guys pay Artists/Animators
Spectre trailer
Clove is real one for using a spectre when everyone else bought a vandal.
new agent at the end?
valorant movie would be crazy
I’ve never got so horny with a valorant trailer
Riot "plz keep taking my money" with good content and keep teaching overwatch how to make good content!!!!!
Shi map
cant wait for another map that ill have to wait 2 years for it to come back when it leaves
1:50 is that wall hack?
raze getting ready to get more kills with her satchels then her ult
cant wait for my jett to accidentally dash into the abyss and use all her util trying to get back up 😭
was that mt fuji?
yo is that what i think at the end???? NEW AGENT???
Epic
cant wait to dodge this map
genshin copy noobs
De_vertigo
3:10 another new agent???
Bro omen used fake tp 💀
CAN'T WAIT FOR MAP VETO
Ay yooooo The New Agent is Coming
bring back haven please
I am glad they finally made a map that represent my new ELO when it comes out.
this map looks insane
3:11 new agent teaser?!?!!
I hope this means we get a PvE mode
When will you remove sunset from the map pool?
new map anddd new agent?? who was that at the end?? was it omen?
3:11 is this sneak for the new agent?
3:11 new agent
3:14 new agent ?!
They use the Iso orb in the trailer but rework him next patch so he doesnt have orbs anymore 😂😂
Wow actually found the video without having to scroll through hundreds of crappy reuploads.
Avant de faire des animations, régler l'histoire de votre anti cheat IA qui ne marche pas, de vos robots qui répondent à la place d'un humain surtout quand on ne sait pas se défendre. Votre jeu est pitoyable. En 20 ans de jeux multijoueurs, je n'ai jamais vue ça!!! une vrai catastrophe Un 0 pointé
1:23 no one gonna talk about that flexinja move?
As an Omen main for almost 5 years, it pleases me to see his lore coming to light and how deep the game is focusing on him now.   P.S. NEW CHARACTER?? Looks feminine... and monstrous.
the death drop!@?!@!?
😍😍😍
UFF new agent too?
Why is clove taking cover and not running it all down if they are immortal?
Once this is added I can't wait for you to bring this map out of rotation for a whole year just to add a couple boxes and move the spawn barrier
why is clove's spectre can one shot?
3:09 AGENT 08!!??
2:30 the most sickest line "humph, monster comi'n to you"
i have downs
I think valorant needs a pve mode like a story mode no??
Can i get a valorant gun buddy
This trailer is so boring to be fair.
lair copy ????
Ready to throw the spike down
When is it comming?
3:08 no one is talking about this part, looks like a new agent to me
yooo norwegian map
1:28 omen tech eeh...
3:14 new char???
Why is valorant obsessed with omen
70° 50' AJ" N, 9° 0 0 " VX"
1:23 omen clone in action
cant wait to see my sliver neon team mate to double slide and fall off the map
finally a small map
Riot can't expect us not wanting PvE mode after giving us so other enemies, besides Omega agents. The way other entities are included in few recent trailers, makes us want PvE mode to be a thing fr
Omen lookin like me when I go for a knife kill
Throwers gonna love this map
Meanwhile normal lobby everytime there is smoke whole team rotate
1:24 omen casually doing a fake tp like it was Dr freeze 💀💀
Worst than fracture
Pls we need more gekki animation plssss
Man these trailers really make me want a PvE mode of sorts for Valorant. Get a one-up on the failed potential of Overwatch 2 and do something way more interesting.
why dis trailer look crappy compared to the previous ones?
If only my spectre could one tap in the head...
WHAT HOW WOULD SAGE RES THE PERSON WHO FELL IN THE PIT????😰😰
0:17 the reload after one bullet, classic Can't wait to play on this map, it looks sick!!
Neon mains like myself will love this map. Can always tell!!  That fact she’s getting buffed with this map release is EVEN better!!!
NAH BRO I CANT, Clove accent is just horrible
imagine valorant having a storymode. I would buy it for sure, if its not like what overwatch delivered after misleading us
2:25 Omen whiffing his knife then dabs enemy is the most hillarious thing
I like how they added little details like checking your magazine but still kept the movie/game chuck your empty one on the ground because you can't refill them right?
The enemy team pulling out odin in the last round. Accurate 😂
I love omen
Yo can we talk abt the end part?
Is that a knife only bundle valorant is selling?
Artorias is punching the air right now
Omg wait in the hourglass.... Was that...ANOTHER OR EVIL OMEN?
DARE TELLING ME OMEN ISNt THE MC
3:17  who is he
cant wait for the new agents
2:41 new weapon?!
Iso is such a copy of gojo satoru lmao
where replay comment :(
I think this map inspired by vertigo and nuke from cs go
wait wait , we gotta do parkour now???
Omen is always cool with his power. I like it
3:14 is that a new agent?
OMEN WHIFFED A DAGGER
yarak gibi harita btw
2:24 If that's real. It will be wild angle!
Valorant removing replication so they can replicate dust 2 🔥, if u look at the map layout they’re identical
Reminds me of the map Evac from BO3
Could do a moderately decent campaign one day
Could that be agent 3?
amazing ty valorant team
is it gona be a BATTLE ROYALE
Just make an anime already
If only the game was as good as the cinematics
RITO really add vertigo in valorant
Nah clove is has wallhack that round was way to unfair ( i was the bucky guy )
Valorant pls ad 3v3 competitive i5 will be a pleasure
why is clove on a half buy
So the desert eagle is coming right?
Bro i have trauma after genshin Abyss dont do it to me
I like how iso just won his ult in .2 seconds in 2:44
we got fake tp omen cinematic befor GTA VI
Petition: Riot should make a web series on Valorant..!!!!
i feel like its gonna be a team deathmatch map only but at the same time i hope its not
Could the monster at the end be agent 8????
These soldiers are a bunch of silvers. When the vandal fails , bring out the odin ......
A map where you can intentionally fall off? Esports players are gonna love this one, they don't have to die to spike anymore.
As an Omen main, goddd this is epic! Monster huh?
This was one of the worst cinematics, what happend to the cinematic department? It went downhill. Used to be legendary! Anyways.. if Sage takes the lead does that mean Brimstone is dead?
Plz don't remove split
LETS FREAKING GOOOO
Finally a Map where you can fall off
Music is super irri and good
New agent?
ithink iwill get big DROP FPS  in this map
Great animation guys but can we like start moving the plot forward more, just doesn't feel like anything has changed in the story.
Hoped for Clove to die because I wanted to see the ult haha
I just really love the 2d art mixing with the 3d art showing their radiant powers its enjoyable
I bet I am gonna throw bc of that rope jump
That last shot is so interesting lorewise. I wonder who’s in there, and why. There’s a good chance that the purpose of this base is to keep them in…and maybe a chance that this is Agent 8. Edit: that last bit aged poorly now that Vyse is out
the fake tp tho on 1:28
The rope will be a team killer...
Is that a new agent reference at the end of the trailer?
1:26 did the clone trick!!
yo, that's dr freezes technique 1:23🔥🔥
Rare footage of cypher not getting cypherbullied
hype
riot when it come to making the worst maps imaginable
new agent foreshadow
did omen just fail a knife lmao
New agent?
I thought clove was pretty ugly looking on release  She still as ugly as i remember
8 Legged horse in the weaponry showcase... perhaps teasing of an Odin named Sleipnir to come?
So good and I thing there was a reset for a new agent
taskmaster fr incoming
that new agent teaser looks insane ngl
literal goosebumps
Time for episode 9 noww
Guys is spectre getting buff
This cinematic feels lazy
this map might have an a, b, c, and d
animation is trash ngl
So a new map and a new agent tease 😮
Clove already died in the first seconds of the battle? Skill issue
When you stare into the abyss..  The abyss stares back at you.
omg valorant parkour map its official
So New Agent is Japanese :D
WAS THAT A NEW MONSTER AGENT LIKE OMEN IN THE END???
1:51 Okay, so agents get hacks in cinematics smh!!
why no one talking about the beast in the end
could the person in ice be agent 8
donat abdullahu
i liked the part when omen was stranded and said "it's omening time" and omened all over the map
Funny thing being, everyone talking about how breach is gonna rip on this map, by throwing people off map, or using aftershock to flush them out, but my homie hasn't even been seen for years...😅😂
3:15 new agent teaser?
OMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN <3
OMEN DID THE ROBIN TP. PLEASE GIVE ROBIN HIS CREDIT
THE UNHOLY AMOUT OF RANKED TEAMMATES THAT WILL DIE BY FALLING ON THEIR OWN IS GONNA BE INSANE.
Build Team washed. Im glad i quit this game.
PvP mode??? seems the enemy uses guns from the game too
Need more lore videos, this is just too good. Maybe the 3 month (or so) wait gives the hype for them.
this map is big it needs c site
3:22 посхалка
I wish heaven was back
2:58 heh, overtime
He did the fake tp 😂😂😂
Bro did a fake relocate tp
New agent?
New agent leak maybe ?! lessss goooo.....🤌
loved it
wait, Omen is left handed?
yo at the last of the trailer there was something in there in the chamber , new character ?
Was that a new agent at the ending? Or omen?
new agent is also coming? what is that clip a foggy hand at least is it the new agent??
THIS IS SO GOOD AAAAAAHHHH
You can fall off the map??? LMAO
LETS SHOW THEM THE MEANING OF FEAR
I can’t believe Omen fake tp in a cinematic 😍 But failed to knife bro 💀  That was so goofy and I absolutely love it
so no one is talking about new agent??
So, no more Replay System comments? 😂😂😂
Can't wait to be one tapped run n gun desynced movements, full of cheaters.
Counter strike clears
OMEN ON THE TRAILER LETS GOOOOOOOOOO!
Imagine trying to do the rope jump in a high ping 😅
Best Valorant cinematic yet, I think the frozen claw at the end might be the next agent
VALORANT story mode  when?
Is that the new agent at the end of the video ?
They done added Vertigo in Valorant
new agentttttttttttttttttttttt teaser
this is fire
Man... New replay system looks amazing.
Plzz omen bufff, omen buff??? Omen buff????????
3:06 looks like a new agent coming
NAH the fake omen tp got me all giddy like a child BROOOOO
is it me or the quality overall of the animation is worse than the previous map presentations or videos?
new omen enemy? in the end
BETTER THAN SUNSET
2:02 huh? they said that he can get the shield by on
bruh! What happened to the animation It's bit like fortnight
I think a mew agent will come
ah shi new agent again
ananin ami
Another claustrophobic map
story mode when?
Seems like another fail
if you not neon,jett, omen or raze dont you dare attempt that jump
what even is that chamber at the end there? new agent confirmed already ⁉⁉⁉
... Reloads after every 3 rounds burst
03:13 New Agent Teaser??
ISO THE MAN YOU ARE.
the budget for this is something you'd see in a 5th grade science fair project
I think i am creaming
OMG OMEN DID THE FAKE TP THING
New character
Wait, that last panel, Agent 8?😮
when 8.11 update online?
As an omen main I'm really happy with getting more omen lore
bro can't make replay system.
We need a Wingman Mode in Valorant please
Holy sh Cypher didnt die this time?
No shot omen did the fake tp
i am so hyped
When will it be available?
1:31 is the best line
1:23 OMEN BUFF
i bet its gonna be a trash ah map
why is the artstyle like that? its not like other animation trailers, the quality seems really bad.
1:23 DoctorFreeze reference???
Who's hand it was in the end  New agent reveal??
This is giving me a old CS 1.6 vibe
1:29 omen fake clone
What was that hand in the portal? Hmmm,maybe a new agent i suppose or story mode 😂
Let us all prepare for getting abused...
won't lie, it was a good short for a map trailer but nothing beats their act animated videos
better than sunset
Are you sure this trailer is for the new map? 😅
OMEN KI MAUSIIIIIIII DIKHI LAST MEIN
Down the abyss we go
Cloooooveeee, they're the best character by far, the accent it's just top notch. Enby people  ftw.
boss and pvm incoming ?????
I don't understand, is there like two floor sites? Maybe three?
3 sites?
2:25 omen -10000 aura
bro clove accent is so annoying, can't listen to her, literally, she's the only reason I have characters muted in game
i cant wait to hate this map
The dialogues are cheesy but at least the visuals are pretty. And the map? Well, it's their version of Vertigo. It looks nice tho.
2:41 does that guy have a rocket launcher😢😢 ?
Some parts of the map kinda reminds me of Control
cant believe omen gottem with the tp-bait
I lost interest in this game tbh, but I'll Still be in touch for the sick lore.
0:38 😂❤🎉Omenn
praying for the bundle to be good cuz i lost a bet to my friend and i gotta buy it now
1:23 omen making a fake teleport ! It's insane how the cinematics ajusts as we, the players find new ways to use the abilitys
1:24 Fake Omen TP
3:15 new agend?
BoBoBoBorinnnnnggggggg 🗣️
We got valorant Enkanomiya map before GTAVI 💀
A bit hard to take this seriously when all bullets just do no visible damage and everyone just falls down for seemingly no reason. But I assume this is this way because itbhad to be shown in china.
worst Scottish accent
Maybe not likely in the near future, but I wish we'd get a full length movie or a Valorant animated series..
this map looks sick asf but its probably gonna be dogshit
great, can't wait to dodge this map 😍
1:23 omen use the clone technique just like the players use in the game
oh bruh so that's why there's a rope jump obstacle in the range 💀
they should give us a pve mode it would be so cool with the characters
wait wait wait. is that a new agent in the hour glass ??
Can this map alr go out of rotation pls
Clove hardscoping so bad
Vertigo?
iso is badasssssss
This exact same map was already in roblox valorant (Rushpoint) INSANE!
A little bit of CS2-Vertigo vibes. Im down for it!
This map seems like the mixture of split and fracture
how tf does a 9mm bullet from a spectre penetrate the guard's helmet
The person in portal, NEW teaser?? Hmmm
They are hiding our replay system
OMEN FAKE TP 1:23 that's unexpected
Хуйня трейлер, переделывайте.
release date ??
fresh map , fresh plays, exciting times :D
Can’t wait
Who in the end?
Just give us a Valorant movie already
New Agent??
Is that agent 8 ? 😶
3:14 new agent?
Yo this map fire asf
Im guessing this is a vertical map rather than the normal map thats one whole layout since of the fact that theres 3 floors, as well as multiple stairs could be wrong but my idea would also be hella fun
A NEW AGENT?!?!?
"Let's throw guys"
Wow what a nice map
Map is great!!!!
did they changed the Omen VA? he's sounding so weird
Cant wait to play on this map and upload it
Clove is a girl bruhh
The best map in valorant
Post credits 🔥🔥🔥
report omen he is trolling
can't wait to watch my teammates die on the replay system when it comes out :D
we finally can run it down mid with this map
as usual the OST slaps, riot music department never disappoints
This map’s gonna have places where you can drop to death
There is so many heights and peaks you have to watch out of. Initiators are essential, but like fracture it isnt a hood map for sova😢
3:12 Agent 08?
New agent ?? COMIN?
Vertigo with catwalk..cool
is that a new agent in that freezer thingy
so sigma
Just make a show already :(
Please put boundaries on this map, I already get trolled enough
we should have a pve event
3:13 don't tell me there a new agent teaser
Abyss map is a game changer and a whole new kind of map and not boring as sunset
Can't wait to only be playing only7 maps at a time again :D
yoooo who is that at the end
looks like we got vertigo from cs in valo
man clove looks so fine in this trailer, shes so cute!!
Omg omen is so cool, finally some recognition for our boy ❤, I'm so happy i main omen🎉❤
new champ?
THIS IS SO AMAZING ONG
Is that the new agent at the end 😮🤔
1:51 okay what was this? WHY DOES IT LOOK SO CHEAP?
A cinematic where cypher dosent die
Clove wrecking with that half buy
Wait is that a new agent at 3:11
Atleast they didn't kill cypher
Valorant content - 🙋  Cs2 content - developers died for years
3:15      8'th  agent  had frosted?????
this omen is def iron 1
Is the monster inside the portal or ice the  Agent 8?!?! Maybe yes mabye no I WANT TO SEE VALORANT I will be waiting
No bad map😢😅🤮
Nobody is talking about the new agent 😭
The last scene is that new agent clue 🤩 amezing
production budget looks to have gone down. This looks unfinished.
Omens fake tp was awesome haha
When it is released
time to put my minecraft parkour skills to the test.
New agent I progress guys
I'm literally that Omen: the fake tp peek, and the knife tp.
its logical and illogical at the exact time lmfao
Was that an agent leak in the last
This looks like Icebox A site except it’s not just a site it’s the whole map
New ice agent??
New Agent is.. Monster??
New agent hints?
This looking a lot like a halo map tbh
Omen missing the knife is the realest thing ever
new agent?!? 🥶 3:13
This map with a gun game mode will be massive fun ❤❤❤
Nighthaven labs
Clove playing specter... Why?? 😂😂
We Need Valorant Mobile beta test date 😭😭 it's enough we can't wait anymore   Like if you agree
I’m trickshotting, 1440 suicide ones swap, who wants to 5 man?
W reveal val should have a story mode
Valorant should start making movies, or like a series.
The new agent in the end maybe can manipulate the time.
been wondering is the whole agent 8 thing has to do with an hourglass looking like an 8
Valorant feeding us 2 years worth of content next week
its so cool to see footage of the agents, almost like something a replay system could do
Efectivamente es cine, el mejor mapa.
0:03 new map?! 1:01 new melee?! 2:40 new weapon?! 3:14 new hero?! 2:51 is that zellsis!!??
they had clove's ult animated too but then decided to delete it cus the video was too long
we need Breach in next cinematic.
3:15  New agent?
new mode finally coming??? 3:14 is it a boss fight? im excited
It’s funny how iso is shown more in these cinematics than in ranked
I wish the animation was better, I think they got a little lazy this time. Still nice though I guess.
Finally something with omen , and besides omen said monster 😂
It seems like Deadlock has taught Clove really well with how they aim
Thats kinda low budget
So when does Yoru ever come back in the animations?
Omen mains missing their knife
OMG LETS GO
3:13 Enemy for PvE ?
Bro who tf is that in the end. Inside the hourglass looking thing 3:15
Güncelleme gelmeden hemen rank atlayın troller sizi bu haritada oynatmaz
what a beautiful map
Clove in a cinematic is like a breath of fresh air! New characters getting recognition is such a good feeling!
Gonna become a typical boring map in 2 months. Val needs to add a random spice to these maps to keep it as exciting as it looks in Trailers
did clover just said "I'm immortal" and not "we/are immortal" so this cinematic confirm that clover indeed She / He, and not They/Them
Did ur ui team or editor team change??
That rope jump is kind crazy, i hope they make the distance shorter so we dont fall and die easily
This map seems so funn
I wonder if we'll ever get PvE for Valorant
new agent ??
yall............. no boundaries
2:50 guy really means : Overtime is ODINTIME
2:41 Iso just takes bro to the shadow realm
2:40 Iso’s best badass moment ever
bring back pearl
CMON RIOT! MAKE A VALORANT MOVIE RIGHT NOW!
Why is nobody talking about the end? Like who is that..
Kind of hyped not for the map or agent reveal but for pve tbh, this would actually be fun and with a higher difficulty it could be like aim training for either low elo or just training in general for high elo
Bro ❤❤❤
Wow🎉🎉🎉🎉 so nice released map!!! Tnx Riot
How new agent sneak peak
0:28 Iso pulling out the "ls" LMAO mood Edit: OMG is the end referring to new agent?!?!
Replay system.
W
plssss I want Haven back T_T
Poor guy being called monster poor omen...
omen ,...our babygirl
Clove is obviously walling xD
New agent sneak peek at last?
Bro they are struggling against bots
There will be a new agent as well along with the map
Also is that a hint at a possible new weapon? Looked like a rocket launcher or something but almost everyone else had normal guns. They could just as it for dramatic effect but almost everything in this cinematic was from the game except that and the grenade.
The comment section looks wrong without the replay system comments
what about end its OEMN or something CREATURE  3:09
loved that they showed the omen fake tp
So cool except clove
GG! We loved making the music for this map reveal! Massive shoutout to the VAL fam and everyone involved 🖤🤙🏽
New agent stuck in freezer? Got hands like omen
2:41 new gun?
releasing when?
she’s hacking
I’m body blocking my friends on that jump
OMEN DID THE DOCTOR FREEZE PEEK 1:21
i love this map and 2 fun . lets team up
2:11 the lowkey CS2 walking through smoke bloom diss “they’re good, we’re better”. We see you riot devs
whos ready for over time. shes so cute XD
ain't no way omen missed the knife kill💀
Who else would want a pve system?
This is so Valorant (never played it before)
Breach should get some screen time man🥹
maybe a new agent will also release
wait a min.... is is thaaat agent 8 ???????
this map is craazy bro
1:10 iso cracked
Imagine if Valorant had a PVE mode
Is that omen at the end or a new agent?
Trailer kinda bad it my opinion
Did Omen just did Omen Clone???
nice map valo❤
goofy aaahhh game company
Wtf is this comp??? Riot are literally trolling no cap. Who plays 2 smokes and iso on abyss🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 reported anyways
🤣🤣
ARE WE GETTING CO-OP MODE? IS THIS A SIGN ?
Fire can't wait
Ngl that part with Iso where he shoots his orb to tank a grenade and the the text “BETTER” appears after he kills the guy js so cringe
clove we dont want overtime.
3:13 New agent is coming!
What was the last character that appeared??😮😮
i can't wait for half my team to fail the rope jump and just die 15 seconds into the round
did omen just fake tp in a cinematic
woah!
I HOPE THATS AGENT 8 (IM DELULU)
is this 2014 or what
THE END?? NEW AGENT?? Even tho it looks like omens claws tho at 3:14
Who's shown at the end of the trailer? Is it omen?
As an omen main I can conform that was me yesterday going out for a side hustle.
Wow vertigo!
why is the animation so ugly💀
Hot takes:but i like the older animation better
New agent 🤯
Did I just see a new agent??
2:23 Omen doing Minato scene
AZYSS
Wow GREAT I CANT PLAY EVEN AFTER TURNING ON TPM 2.0 I CANT PLAY YEYER I LOVE THIS GAME 🎉
OMEN SAID THE LINE😮
Nice reveal anotheral agent:)
imagine if valorant had a story mode￼
Clove using that specter to 1 tap enemies🙂
Clove and Iso are my mains. This trailer is ticking all the right boxes for me.
new agent?
parkour
Can we get some actual lore instead of more players?!
new map new agent sheeeeeeeeesh
did omen get fake tp skill ?
clove just climbed after missing the jump thats ridiculous
this map looks so sick
I love Clove, SHE is an amazing agent
One bot has a rocket launcher 2:39, and why nobody is talking about the final escene? Could be a new agent 😮
This animation studio also makes a great video game about this show, the game is also called Valorant! Too bad they spend a lot of their time on the game though, I love these episodes
bro the animation got worse they washed ngl
Very good animation  and storyline
Old iso 😢
Anubis?
All i see is how many are gonna fall to their death 😂
who put die rise in valorant?
This is about to be the BEST map ever
Why does Omen sound like Megatron for no legitament reason
As a cypher main, what if i put my trapwire in the middle of rope jump. The enemy is dead no?
This animation has less budget put into it but still great!
A new agent is also coming ❤❤
The best act so far
Fuji 🥶🥶🎖️👊
Valorant cinematic is falling off tbh
0:35 bro omen reloaded twice in this 5 secs
Thats wow TP Omen peaked😮😮😮
3:10 new agent 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Map and agent teaser. Riot, u spoil us
forgot iso exists
Valornt why do u hate breach  so much
a new melee weapon could be a royal sword based on the horse picture on 1:00
Easter egg for the next weapon:  🔥rocket launcher🔥
2:40 A new weapon 😱😱??
Clove looks so goofy lol omen goat
1:26 that tp is so cool to use in game
lets goooooooo
2:25 No wayy Omen whiffed that knife kill. Nahh💀
New agent leak?
Somehow the quality of this trailer isn't as good as the previous one. Still excited to see a new map though.
I heard that the new map will be Bastion but now it is Abyss. Is it another map which will be added along with Bastion ??
was that new agent leak in the end
3:14 teasing a new character or what
I hope this map is balanced
Iso is the omen from past  Present omen we have  Fature omen is the agent 08 💀💀💀
the animation seems to have been animated with the game render and not a full cinematic render
Banyakna patahanna
throwing gonna be easy on this map lmfao
I wish my team play two smokers too :(
False video. Accurate Spectre? Double HA spectre kill? A couple single HS too. Who are they trying to fool?
I cant wait for movie of valorant
They now have 16 years old kid shooting in game too, Incredible Riot😂
vertigo but undeground
Is this abyss possibly a spiral?
I like clove's voice
Is it just me or does this map seem absolutely gigantic?
Its getting the series!!
It’s compti map ?
New map? Alright let's nerf chamber
Woahh !! The fake tp 🫡
3:12 3:12
where is the cypher dying part
3:14 new agent???
What was the last ending omen doppleganger
We want mobile version ❤
riot came up with a different way for my toxic teammates to throw
Imagine there is Valorant story-mode. I need it ASAP
This time Cypher didn't even manage to survive to reach his destination
This map is giving some serious Vertigo energy. There are so many spots where you would need to jump its actually insane. R.I.P to the people who cant do parkour.
Man imagine replay system came with this update 👀👀
omen fake tp was so nice in this]
Omen always cold.
when u r gonna put  heaven map again  ?
Imagine Pearl in a Halo universe lol
agent8 lore confirmed
looks awesome
L aim hourglass
New agent or omen rework 🙂
We got house map
and still no replay system.
replay system for god's sakes
Iso is definitely cool
Ayo what was that rocket launcher looking gun
omen fake tp 😮
Please add story mode it would be way more fun 😊😊
Clover does not look like shes irish, its always so weird seeing her talking... who the heck decided to give her an irish accent
Iso in Cinematic 👿 Iso in Game 🤡
OMEN ON TOP
omg omg omen is so cute
Was hoping we'd see clove die and come back
Lmao they used the omen clone technique
poor skye never been filmed
so we gonna ignore the fact tht they gave us the hint for the  new agent?
3:14 agent 8?
At least Iso is getting picked in the trailers
Update lagi asu
So Is The Glass Hour Thing Holding The Upcoming Agent? Kinda Looks Like Omen
3:12 new agent?
Are we getting a new agent also ??
When will this map release in valorant
So when is the movie released?
This map looks like a rainbow six map
Whyt dont you make 3-5 part movie?
new agent + map, huh..
2:52 Odin ?
Not so clean map
Delete
Verticality has hints of R6 siege to it (a very good thing)
Map looking mess will be pain in s for months
Guys is Reyna Omen Viper Breach Killjoy a good comp to clear this abyss? I got Reyna c2r1 btw
New agent??
nice one
raze &  omen map
Riot should actually introduce PvE event mission maps like this trailer. would've been fun rather than regular game modes
3:18 IS THAT HIM? THE MISSING AGENT 8?
agent 08 ?
Audio glitches won't get fixed, clove needs to be nerfed but won't get nerfed, raze ult needs to be fixed won't get fixed, Reyna Nerf not required but will be nerfed and to cover it up here kids new map
what was teased in the last part?:OOO NEW AGENT??! OMEN REWORK!!!??
2:50 something funny just staring at the npc's just going down the stairs..and it resulting to just nothing lol..
valorant story mode would be fun
2:17 this is going to be a camping spot 😂
love the game but my god is it cringe
No way we got new map before gta 6
you guys need a new writer
2:25       LITTLE JOHN FELL FROM HIS 0.69 SQUARE APARTMENT WHEN DODGING OMEN SO HE DECIDED TO SELL HIS GUN FOR 1 TRILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND HIS APARTMENT  FIRST HE MADE A FRAME USING GALVANIZED SQUARE STEEL SECURED WITH SCREWS FROM HIS AUNT AND ADDED ECO FRIENDLY WOOD VENEER 🗣️🔥
Either the scaling is off or this map is huge
2:24 bro omen is getting the cypher treatment with that missed knife kill 😭
was that end hinting new agent?
the cinematic looks half baked ngl
I love seeing omen more in this trailers and cinematics :D
pls dont be the worst map ever created!!1
New omen like agent maybe brother of omen in the last seen
the last scene really gave me goosebumps
1:21 only omen mains know who that shadow step move belong to
2:41 definitely a new gun i hope
Omen my boy🔥📈
3:11 is that agent 08
This trailer is so boring
Only if my spectre could 1 tap with spectre like clove's
Why do I have a feeling that I am going to love this map
I feel like we just got sunset 💀
2:23 me everytime i teleport behind enemy
The only exciting thing about this trailer was the next agent sneak peak
Did omen...do  a fake teleport in this
That new agen?
Man, Omen is so freaking cool...  The map seems to have many elevated areas and interesting spots. Looks a lot better than Sunset but have to see the gameplay to really know how well it plays but I actually love the aesthetics of this map
3:14, Welcome back Miguel O'hara
very cs_office vibes
Oh boy i can tell a lot of movement duelists are gonna fall off of this map
GIVE BACK HAVEN
Agent 08 ULT: "ZA WARUDO!! JIKAN WO TOMAREEEEI"
NEW AGENT LEAK?!
do we can fall in this map?
was that agent 8 or some new agent in the end?
Ok this map might be my favorite
bruh another big ahh map
My expectations are low lmao looks like a lotta rat corners
what was tht teaser at the end
new agent ??????
1:27 that omen fake tp 🔥🔥🔥
oh boy cant wait to see which parts of the map are cheeks for the rework
new agent is coming wow 👀😁
2:00 what a forshadowing. ISO no longer need to shoot the orb to activate his shield in the new update
Report Clove for trigger bot and wallhack!
So where do the reflections come in or the valorant legion come in. They're fighting the hourglass right but  in game, we'l be fighting the legion, why would they come to this map?
Bro uses 5-6 tp in a single game
Already know I'm about to hate this map. That just doesn't look good, and what was that pit Clove jumped over, this is gonna be bad
OMG omen tp peeking is canon lets goooooo
Awesome might be more complex than fracture
now imagine if valorant had a campaign
My team don't have this aim
this is pretty cool, replay system?
Omen TP peek attı aw
3  sites ?
3 sites or really big and complex mid
the goon cave is now the sanctum of secrets
New agent?!
It's giving some vibes of Peral😗
Cinematic widescreen wth
Valorant PvE when?
Can’t wait for them to reveal the replay system!
vertigo at home ....
New agent teaser as well 🔥
I guess this map has an environmental hazard
so we can fall of the map now? cool I guess?
WAIT new weapon?!
I literally had a nightmare of this map 😂
The reload habit (reloading after a kill even with 1 tap kill) I 😂😂😂
I guess this map is gonna be hated more than breeze because there are alot of camping spots, boxes, etc
Rudolftoppen, Svalbard
2:25 even if omen missed that knife, he was kinda slick with that dodge tho
Fix your game riot, you can't keep us waiting with long loading times, so long that before my agent selection screen comes up the time is out and I get banned for a few mins, sometimes even hours and it's not just me, other players have also reported the same problem.
Is it just me or does this map feel like Vertigo from CSGO? I'm having the same vibes as I did when I saw the name for the map.
if only the these were a  pve
Plz tell abyss map location
Is that a new agent sneak peek in the end?
can't imagine life with omen having more than 2 tps
wait, so we can died falling😭😊
Goosebumps at the End 😲
L
whos hand is that in the last scene?
OMEN with his fake tp dammmmm
Is it only me or no one is talking about the new agent we saw at the end
The Black Ops 3 wallrun fails are incoming
We got a new map before we got a replay system actually in the game
thank you
man looks amazing , new agent or mode? {they teased}
❤❤❤
Cool trailer now we need generic grunt as a agent so we can play this out
Alright lucky socks don't fail me now!
riot be literally saying we dont need 2 duelist, 2 controller ftw
Me wating for valo mobile 😑
Did they also teased new agent at end????
its so cringe tbh 😭😭😭 the way they speak, like "theyre strong, but we are BETTER" or "Boo"
Is this a TDM or standard map?
spill the map with next future ally agent or villain movie >.<
I absolutely love how their abilities were showcased in this video. Masterful work.
New champ?
Clove must be new cuz bro is holding down sights everytime an enemy is around😭🙏
at 1:00 u can see all the famous knifes that is a good easter egg
new Map and agent
3:12 new agent?
Valorant's Vertigo, I was hoping for a closed off underground though :">
Wait, where's the replay system?
3:12 new agent or who ?
Valorant please do something about the AP servers.. we cant even use buff redeem cards
Is there a new agent in last second?????
Bro we need a movie of 2hrs from valorant.
New agent !!!!! 0:45  to 1:00
I can already see a major skill issue happening when I fall into the abyss for the 14th time in one game
AGENT 8 FINALLLLYYYYYYYYYYY
deathmatch map ???
2:25 Iso: FF
no boundaries? more ways to stole enemy ace, e.g. jump into the abyss ^^
VALORANT 🐖💩 CS GO 🤫🗿
Agent leak I think
2:25 He tripped and fell in the back of McDonald’s
2:25 is it vertigo?
new character !!!1!! 3:13
Fire trailer yo 🔥👌
3:14 has to be agent 8 no?
Omen lore goes burrrrr
3:15 nah bro imagine this is the agent 08, it would be amazing
2:28 lets transform this 1cm into a house
Ice based agent at the end?
Why does it look like the texture quality has decreased with the previous trailers
Huh he thought he could get away calling my man omen "monster" !!!!! . . . . BTW what was that in the end, a new agent??? it got hands just like omen!!!!😐
But when is it coming out?
Is it me or the animation off?
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE REPLAY SYSTEM WITH THIS ONE
OMG is VERTIGO BUT VALORANT VERSION !!!
why is no one talking about the end??? 💀 is it like a new agent ? or omen rework? idk
I feel like the animations are more 3D than before; the animations in the past felt 2D and much more detailed for some reason
in the last that hand was of the new agent
2:22 aint no way omen said “boo”
Day 1 of asking Hindi text at the last scene. "Where every other popular language is displayed", for "Defiance"
Clove Got Tenz AIM
Was that a new agent leak at the end or the other omen?
told u underground facility.....the lore is getting juicy now....finding the first light lore and about omen finally
something something replay system never forget
3:11 could it be.....agent 8? Maybe we're getting Agent 8 now in E9A2
Who was that at the end ? Looked like Reyna's hand.
3:09-3:15  can anyone can tell me who was inside?
the new agent? in the hour class structure
2:25 booooo XD
3:14 new agent or enemy omen?
As a person interested in architecture and urban planning I HATE how they use the actual maps for cinematics because the gameplay map just do not translate to reality at all and really breaks immersion. On the other hand I understand for a video like this it is a MAP TRAILER. I'm just saying tho, it's the first thing that comes to my mind every cinematic they do with in-game maps as the setting.  Also the writing needs work mang
Finally! A 4×4 km Map
looks like R6 map lmao
Already looks azz
POV: when your teammate tells the team to be quiet and play for picks
This makes me wanna play omen main again 🗿
Map is more tactical. Looking forward to it. Idk about the open spaces on mid but it’s gonna be challenging looking to 3 sides while crossing
They make the map so good that everyone forgot about the reply system 😂......lol
Sage: "Omen you need to get out of there." Omen: "No." Sage: "K"
oni claw recolor 😁 0:58
new agent teaser too hmmm...
Lore wise, i'm kinda lost how they got there
They teased the new agent at the end of this trailer, i think that their powers would be "electric" , this is because the riot games logo has been blue and with electric effects for quite some time also the effects on the walls at 3:03 it would be interesting to have another agent with electric abilities, or if that is not an agent teaser.... but for some antagonist in the lore~
At 3.14 is that a new agent teaser?
The animations are just getting more open and relaxed! I feel like a Valorant movie comin' up?
3:14 Agent 08?? or a new Agent? or a new enemy.. 3:00 The Enemy said "No I ready for Odintime" 2:14 They good, We are Better 2:24 Omen: Boo, *Dodging* and then falling.. 2:29 "Hmm.. Monster" It sounded like Omen was starting to like it. I just realized that Iso didn't get a gun damage from the enemy. Maybe because he is a former member of Hourglass. I can't wait for The new map, The lore, and all the Updates
dude idk what anyone says about valorant falling off or being cringe i find it very engaging
Imagine being a brimstone main that loves post plant mollies and getting this map:
omen?
We want the the Mystbloom bundle in the shop
who had pointed fingers
i didnt understand the last part
Clove buy specter in full buy round hmm run and gun are better
3:14 New agent teaser????
WHEN?!
The end... Is it showing any signs of new map + " New agent? "
can i get uhh gameplay?
What are the chances thats agent 8 being held captive
what an awesome cinematic😎
Bring back Haven TvT
omen fake tp is so good
NEW AGENT GLIMPSE LESS GO
New agent?
I guess ppl will now have an easy way to throw the game 😅
The coordinates being 70° 50' 1 10" N, 9° 00' 22 24" W, leading to the Norwegian Sea near the Arctic Ocean don't make too much sense.
What about valorant mobile ?
I hope the new character they hinted to is part creature/animal (referring to the claws). We got a robot, so what about a werewolf, demon (omen is a ghost /phantom), or an alien.
What is this aomination of a map? Its like you combined haven , pearl and fracture 💀
I donno, riot kinda fell off somewhere in-between a map reveal and half assed animated video, just give me one proper map reveal, and release a separate animated video
they really cooked this time LES GO 🔥
new OMAR LORE LETSSS GOOOOOOOO
Valo story mode loading
new legend???? les gooo
new map new bugs 😅
i swear bro sage be talking like a npc
Yea sir let’s go valorant
2:20 VALORANT LEFT HAND PEEK UPDATE
I can see why Iso have buff and Clove have nerf.
New agent? The end video..
2 agent tease
ok, so omen can also miss the knife kill 😂😂
Did they leak the next agent at the end?
wow lots of player experience in this trailer like omen tp peek knifing ememies
2:22 mom i wanna be like him
did i just saw a glimpse of a new agent at the end?
No one gonna talk about the agent leak at the end?
looks like we are getting a new agent gouts since the bullets shot the hour glass door
so uhh clove just died in the beginning? lmao avg clove users dies at the start
if you're immortal why aint you just running in like stupid
3:08 new agent???
3:15 is this going to be a new agent
DUDE I LOVE THESE TRAILERS AND THE COOL INCLUSION OF ABILITYS BRO THIS IS PERFECT
Add a custom reload for aemondeir that will make it so much more worth it 🙏🙏🙏
nah this is gonna be my worst win rate map ever
First map with no boundaries? So when can die fall?
is it just me or this felt lower quality then usual
did nobody saw the that there was the new agent trapped in the abyss   I guess the missing agent
Im sorry but this animation does not look good. It use to look like arcane but now it just looks undone and cheap. I get that this isnt one of the cinematics and theyre trying to save budget but this is probably a new low for valorant animation
3:14 thats agent 8 for sure!!!
Full camp hoga
Rocket launcher coming soon??
This is better than freaking sunset
IS THERE IS ANY NEW AGENT COMING WHAT WAS THAT IN THE LAST
this freaking omen giving me goosebump everytime.. i love this omen!
Aight listen, I know this is a map trailer but is 2:41 a tease that will be getting an rpg-type in the game? That'll be fun and f**ked up at the same time.
So there's a location called library with a breakable door. I hope that rope jump is actually in the game. Would be fun to miss it while trying to clutch.
nah omen would have got that knife 😔
Can we just talk about the level of animation that riot graphic designers are at? The animation is smooth, yet realistic + comic style. Animating the gun mags, bullet tracers, aiming down sights and even facial expressions makes it feel like a movie of its own. I hope the animators get paid their worth and riot doesent just goble down on the profits themselves...
What song or music?
Last one is new agent 🤔🤔🤔🤔
i wonder who the new champion they're teasing is gonna be!
JUST BRING BACK HAVEN!!!!!!
3:15 new agent?? Or not
the knife collection at 🤤 0:59
Can we get yoru in the next trailer
3:13 is that new agent?
So u can fell out of the map now
Now bring back replication, put this map in the queue, everyone select raze and we're about to have some real fun.
I don't recall the last time I saw chamber in any cutscene.
Being bad at parkour and falling off in the new map during comp will be real pain
Wahhh open tp and clove shots are was awesome ❤
This game is slowly dying bcs of the pro player
New character have claws confirmed
Wait what, where is the cool cool song
I can't wait to lock raze and instantly satchel my own team into the holes in the map w map rito
Ironically, the most human-like plays in this video were done by Omen
QUE UM PERSONAGEM HEALER
You should add a timed kill course
I saw a rocket launcher-looking weapon at 2:40, let's keep it in this video aight
Make a movie already.
Remove sunrise from the map pool pls
0:04 Location : Jan Mayen, Norway
man this is gonna be my new favorite map
Please give us updates with console as soon as possible when you can
3:10 is that new agent?
3:10 is that new agent ?
3:10 what's that ? 🤔🤔
Iso casually joining Omen in this map's trailer as if he isn't on a mission to assassinate him
the korean word is supposed to be 디파이언스, not 레블레이션
He did the omen TP peak!
i wish valorant had some pve walk through missions like this trailer
3:14 zombie mode is coming
2:22  he said my name primeBOOM thankyou Valo I'll continue my livestream
i just have a vison of seeing alot of people dying to the falls
I swear to god theyre gonna come out with a pve mode some day
Environmental kills? Lets goo.
Ahhhhhh🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤… the voices and their meanings omg. Loved it
This map gimmick is literally parkour
Dang clove with the smoke double kill headshot 🔥
3:13  new agent؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟
NEW CHARACTER USING ICE POWERS? MAYBE A SMOKE ?
Their gun got no recoil
inside map no way
New suspence in end of vedio who was there inside. Is Omen? Or a another agent? 🤩🤩
Wait did i just see a RPG!!!!2:41
This map would look a lot nicer in the reply system
billion dollar company is absolutley terrible at animation this is actually so vile
In the last wee got the new agent like omen (edit)
Can't wait for my team to just die by falling
Which map will they replace with this map Abyss?
Next valorant mobile announcement😢 pls
billion dollar company cant even make talking look good in animations actually disgusting.
Is this map available in Swiftplay?
my man omen is getting the interest he deserves. hope we will see him and cypher more!
bruh the buget got cut wtf this down grade animation
This is what I switched games for, honestly worth it
Boaster was right about the elevators!!!
Lets see if valo cooks with this one or we get cooked with this
It's very nice, thank you Riot Games
animations lacking compared to other ones
Why is Clove 1 tapping with a spectre though lmao?
Wait wait wait wait wait. Does Scion have another omen???
Dark map
Now we're getting maps where we can fall off and spectate our team for the rest of the round, cool!
OMG THATSSS FIREEE
why they give iso a tiny head and a giant fridge body
Wait only me see this animation used skill of agent like ingame, they are not good at all, i think they will use skill insance more than 💀 ( Sorry about my grammar)
Soo 3 sites?
we are gonna see many people falling off the map LOL
New agent already? Glad we dont need to wait whole 1 year for another one.
We really need a valorant series
Riot does know how to make some good trailers ehh?
3:10 sooooo, new agent teaser ?
Iso in video 💀 Iso in game 🤡
Valorant mobile News
iso is looking good❤
3:15 Lissandra it's that you?
I look at the roof there is no line up
that half rope is insane 🔥
its the smallest things in life  clove first voiced appearance
Why are they talking in one liners lmao it is so cheesy
Rocket launcher?
The ending makes me think, there will be a new objective on the map to fight for that will give a potential advantage to the winning team
It’s cool they showed the knives
Agent 8?
3:15 who's that
Little Omen worked 10 years for the valorant agency and managed to save up 20 million Valorant Points, this afforded him THIS 0.6mx2.4m coffin apartment.
I'm just speculating but at 3:07 maybe they're finally about to drop some agent 8 lore in the giant hourglass that looks like an 8
im planning on waiting on the rope to flank hehe😊
Is the new map representing a new Agent.? Who has the hands like omen.?
Woh wohh omen. My lovely agent ❤️🤌🏻
last seen... new agent????!!
I think there would be some underground routes to connect A and B. (So exciting!!)
AYOOO , my Spectre don't do that 🥲
3:16  new agent?
So basically 0 innovation ? Great riot
looks like we have another map to throw this op down and perhaps the body too
NEW AGENT?
exciting however i would say this is one of the few times animation has disappointed me a bit as many walls in the background are hard to tell if they are walls or paths or diagonal. It looks like a hard map to animate. It has many different heights if that makes sense
Bro at the end of the trailer was that a sign of new agent?
still no skye cinematic? :((
Cypher didnt die lesss go
i am SICK and TIRED of this ISO GLAZE. WHERE IS NEON OR FADE OR DEADLOCK OR SKYE OR ANYONE ELSE IN THESE CINEMATICS ????????????????????????????????????????????? APART FROM THEIR OWN TRAILERS THEY LEFT OUT OF EVERYTHING BUT NAH LETS MAKE ISO THE FRONT COVER OF EVERY ACT PUT HIM IN THE VCT TRAILER (even tho he isnt even played in vct) LETS PUT HIM IN THE 3 MOST RECENT CINEMATICS LIKE HELLO HE IS A TERRIBLE AGENT PLS DELETE HIM
omen missing that knife kill is so accurate
omen is the coolest among all the valorant agents
Everyone: enjoyinmg the cinamatic. Me: trying to figure out if lineups are viable
🗿👌
OMEENNNN 😭😭😭😭 YOURE SO COOL 😭😭😭😭
Valorant, I want a system where you can fight ai agents
Who inside the (frost gonem?)
New map came before gta6
The beginning after the end 👀
You can play on this map in a custom game:). I did it.
This is inaccurate how are they so accurate one tapping everyone with Spectre
Alright lucky socks, don't fail me now was so adorable
"Hey! Dittozkul here , and today we have 3 radiants vs a bunch of irons"
The animation Quality got to the floor in this video
we got Omen Fake TP in a cinematic before we got a Replay System
Tiktok Omen ftw haha
3:14 new agent ?
The amount of abilities in this trailer is crazy
Why does this look like it was made in source
I will go crazy if they don’t add an Italian agent, oh wait. My username is crazy.
70° 50' AJ" N. 9° 00' VX" W
I didn't realize that the logo of Valorant is in the gun when you ADS.
What was that last part  i jope its a new agent
The 2D visual effects look a tad bit undercooked
Why does that Vandal at the start sound like a stinger
0:35 omen waited for their reload and then he reloaded his rifle
I do enjoy the games, but sometimes is hard to log in and i got error saying my net is bad 😭 even tho littery same day i download genshin new patch..idk men this games has alot problem.
OK RIOT, I SEE NOW, NOICE
Noice
Why can’t my spectre do that 😢
breach mains when they send the whole team flying off the map:
Valorant's Vertigo map
clove got a ace hahha
Bro omen is so sick his tech looks so much better in these animations
they cooked with every omen scene
new agent? Or new game mode?  not mentioning the map of course I'm mentioning the omen like clone at the end.
That fckn moment when u're ready to duel but got ulted by iso🤣
I can't wait to see what kind of video I'm going to make here 😋😋
can't wait to hate this map after i play it
Without smoker 😂
OMGGGGG THIS is SOO INSANE!!!!
this is sick
Is it just me or does the animation seem a little off
This trailer's so cool I wish I could somehow replay it.
ez odin spammer imagine spam imagine team 3 team spammer ez get clapped 3v500 ez ez ez
abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss abyss
I also foresee  a new agent teaser coming along the way
cant wait to see vct pros "accidentally" fail the jump at 2:21
2:12 he really said the Gojo line lmao
What country is this?
potential agent leak?
The animation feels a little off for some reason
I just hope we can have PVE
Theory: The "'person" shown at the end of the trailer is agent 8.
yoo its the prowler
that's literally me everytime im trying to hold on to a rope, removing deadlock net and removing cypher's dart.  I always accidentally drop my gun.
Am i just the one kinda feeling that the cinematic right now feels like an MOBILE CINEMATIC ANIMATION?
Also new agent??
I mainly play with omen, but this guy 💀🔥🗿
Bro imagine how hard it is to enter into the site
is that a new agent in the cage at the end of the trailer
LEZZGAAAAWWW
what was the thing at the end? New agent? Or is it just an enemy..
They didn't update Iso's new E ability
AAAA
Lesssssssss gooooo ✨🥳🥳❤️
they should add cypher and sova as enemies
RAT map OwO
AGENT 8??????????????????
Why omen always baddass like this? OMG, the real main character 🥶
so falling out of map is a concern now.
3:15 new agent.....
1:49 VAC! VAC!! CHECK HIM PC !! I MEAN HER!! I MEAN...
Why did omen wanted to show fear to clove ?
isnt this that roblox valorant map?
Wow
This team is the Best team in the universe
not the valorant live event 3:08
Replay system when?
This was low-key their most boring game play cinematic.  Why only 3? Why those 3? What answers? What secrets?  They just keep edging us lol
was that on purpose or he really missed? 😭😭 2:25
Is this a just a new map or a gamemode?? Pve gamemode?
omen with knife is cannon
I CANT WAIT TO PLAY BREACH AND ULT PEOPLE OFF THE MAP 🫰❤️❤️
Haha Omen missing that knife
Made this animation gameplay accurate kinda pog
riot should make like a 5 v ai gamemode. kinda like a wave survival
I was hoping to see Yoru for some reason....
Animation is definitely not giving in this video 😬
I can’t wait to fall off the map
don’t tell me you can fall off the map……..
3:07 There’s a new agent?
why is clove on half buy?
2:17 NAWW WHAT IS THAT
are they gonna switch the map rotation finally, they seriously kept in some of the most boring maps wtf, why does the game even need a "rotation" there's barely any maps unlike csgo, feels like they just copied it for the sake of copying it, or keep the rotation in competitive only if that's the reason
what a good map for our!
what was that cliffhanger....??? Is ther is new agent or some kind of monster packed in there..
So...ARE THOSE BAD GUYS DEVELOPING THE REPLAY SYSTEM? THE SAND HOUR GLASS SYMBOL😢😢😢
Nice trailer... and a hint for a new agent... Nice one riot
its like intersteller based map
Agent 8 comeback?
please please please how can i mute clove voicelines. howd yall pick a accent worse than brits
COD vibes
That fake tp ✊
kollaaam allarum adiichh kerii vaaaahh
agent reveal at the end is so cool! maybe its finally agent 8 and they hold the secret to omen, since that hand looks like reynas, but we know reyna isnt frozen, so maybe its her sisters, since omen was involved in similar experiments to that of reynas sister?
We need Valorant Mobile!!!!!!!
What the cringe?
finnaly haven again inthe map pool and the new map abbys too
Wow you are releasing a new map and here I am unable to install valorant for the last one year because of "We couldn't install required dependencies" error 😐
Is it me or the dialogues in this cinematic feels kinda... Off?
thats agent 8 at the end
Bring fracture back too pls 😭
Time to 36 the abyss 😮‍💨
finally no cypher
HE DID THE ROBIN TP
woow the shading and animation work has fallen off
Omen trolling pls report him
LMAO valorant version of vertigo
wait, the mystery ending isnt a mystery lol. Take a look at the youtube tags.  The boring ones: Abyss,VALORANT Map,New Map,VALORANT CG,VALORANT Cinematic,VALORANT,VALORANT trailer,Episode 8,DEFIANCE,VALORANT Episode 8,VALORANT game,fps,shooters,tactical FPS,launch  Then they list the agents we see/hear in the cinematic: Clove,Omen,Sage (forgot iso?)  And the last tag is: Yoru  Now, its weird that iso isnt listed but i doubt they accidentally added yoru instead of iso. so the mystery agent in the hourglass at the end is likely Yoru  Edit: i just watche the end again, it looks nothing like yoru but yet the tag is there... hmm
I'm sorry am I the only one who doesn't like the iso change like it's supposed to be a buff bur it just makes him seem unfun. Like the entire fun of isonis his snowball and the fact it's all skill. I feel like giving him a better entry option like some sort of scan or slow smt to make it harder for people to compete with him instead of giving him entry thats good but takes aways wut makes iso iso
3:08 agent leak?
The revealing and leak of the newest agent
imagine, you are a trained, seasoned soldier, and as a result you are carried out by a random teenager
2:40 bro got kidnapped 😭
There's like a sunset and Haven
3:10 new agent? Agent 8 perhaps?
New agent at the end?
finally an inside map
ok pero que vuelva heaven
Now this gonna be favourite map for campers
wow they actually made a map half decent this time jeez about time
animation design of everything else: no budget limit abilities: goofy ahh 2d cartoon animation
This map actually looks sick. Feels like riot have finally made a good new map.
3:15 wait a min, new agent?  💀
quem foi que trocou o estagiário destas cinemáticas? volta pro antigo que era melhor, tenho um amigo que faz por 100zão.
Single player campaign
3:11 that looks scary
wait wait does the description say NO BOUNDARIES?
2:48 what is clove saying??
What was the last hint about ?
i better not see this type of animation again pfff
actual radiant
new agent?? 3:15
New agent frozen in ice????? Right at the end
I see that the lethal company jumps ive been practicing is being put to good use
Is it really no boundaries?
I love me some omen. that fake teleport was *chefs kiss*
2:29 hm... mustard
3:15 *Agent 8?*
Does anyone know what gamemode this will be for?
So cooooool
Imagine if we had a replay system to check out this new map
Japan 🇯🇵
Keren cik
Somebody check that Clove's PC.  That spectre play is sus
Map looks good but when will it even arrive ?
I LOVE SEEING THE OMEN TP PEEK AHHHHHHHHH
new agent?
new agent teaser at the end?
Having a descent of stairs and a crossfire is gonna be atrocious to contest.
there are way to many rat spot, but its good
Introduce 'Plastic' rank for my noob teammate
Parkour map
bring back pearl
fr and 1 st time a map like apex houses i love it
i can tell this map is gonna be annoying
NEW AGENT ? AT 3:11 ?
We're hitting Silver with this one
God Omen is cool
Yoooo you can die to the abysss! Not like fracture!
ISO standing on business against the enemy nade was so cool, also omen missing the knife lmfao
1:00 did you notice the different knifes on the wall
Is that new agent???
I can’t wait to crossplay with you PC players once again, if we can.. lmao. I had my first pc 6gb ram but it crapped the bed sadly it was a gift to me
3:11 “GIVE IT TO ME RACHEL!!!”
2:01 Did they really release a trailer with an ability that got completely reworked out? lol
Omen more like Omenoob
is no one gonna mention that possibly new agent tease at the end??
finally.
new agent coming soon
New Maps , New Gun and New Charactwr
Remove map rotation for comp
Omen did the pro gamer move   Shoot once, reload.
Bring back pearl
Among us map
3:03 kinda looks like a better split map
In the last part, before the cinematic ends, someone's hand is moving. Is it the alternate omen or an indication of a new agent coming to valorant soon or are they gonna reveal agent 8 which was missing from the very beginning of the game which was started in 2020 (sage is numbered as agent 7 and phoenix as agent 9). Many questions are there from this cinematic that needs answers, fr.
PARKOUR IN VALORANT IS CRAZY
My spectre don't do that
SUPBERB!
im like 80% sure thats gonna be agent 8 at the end, and im so excited!! the map looks sick!
Vertigo
I can't wait for my rank to fall into the abyss because of this!1!1!
That was boring
Another annoying map in map pool
Is that a new agent at the end🤔?
Pls remove icebox guys
WHATS THAT CLAW IN THE END 🥶🥶
Iso really hate shooting the orb
Indonesian angent? Riot?
dont u say this feel like vertigo and people when saving gonna suicide to jump of building
03:11 new agent? 🥸
Omen saying “boo” was the best part about this
This map is going to look so good in the replay system
yo why tf is this giving me chills rn
New Agent Lets Go!
Omen with the knife 😂
2:40 Railgun, or maybe rocket launcher confirmed. Domination, and capture the point maps coming next. Then vehicles, then missions where you parachute into a map as a circle of death encroaches and you have to be the last team/person standing. Lmao.
i sense a new agent coming 😎😎
3:13 new agent???
New agent?
Next character is a cat girl confirmed
Clove out slay Omen and Iso 😻❗
Finally a good map?
what a way to end the map trailer with a cliffhanger showing the claw at 3:14 lol
Love the game but for some reason the animation looks a lot more cheaper and not as good as before. Still like it, but feels like something’s off yk?
2:25 omen dabbing while the guy falls into the abyss
desde la primera imagen me imagine que era un mapa bajo tierra, que bueno. se ve espectacular
LMAO omen reloads at the opening scene, then reloads again after not shooting a single shot a few seconds later
3:16 who's there
I need them to bring back animation from Warm up....
1:23 HE DID THE OMEN TECH
1:59
OTRO AGENTE NUEVO¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
That ending though… new agent?
The only Monster is Sova on Ascent with an Odin
this map gonna be big and im exicted to sit in a corner and have bomb planted jiggle peaking credit to riot🤑🤑
wait' who was in the end? A new agent?
looks like it will have many angles like icebox but it is actually a good map unlike icebox :D
New Agent teaser at the end? whoa 😮
i WANNA SEE A VALORANT MOVIE
my silver teammates dying from the rope jump 5 sec into the round
New agent?
You have to jump or die?
New agent yup
Happy to get a new map! but plz give back heaven fracture and pearl...
when this map comes?
Where is it located in irl?
W OMEN TP PEEK
You have to jump or die?
A new character? Lets go
bro why the 2d fx is worse now??????
In the end there it's either the new agent, or its Omen's 'body'?
Imagine if the spectra were actually that accurate 😂
Cypher main map
new weapon and new agent tease
Low budget trailer
3:15 it's a new agent or Reyna is hand
is there a new agent?
OMG is that agent 8 at the end???
OOOOHOHHHHHHHHHH
2:24  Players can now actually fall in the map?
valorant movie when??
we got no one complaining about replay system before gta6
Omen missed the knife😂
"Who's ready for OT?" "Who not is g*y" *Press F5*
What's happened to the quality of this cinematic? Lightfarm and Blur produced such stunning visuals but this was really poorly rendered and animated. Looked like unpolished motion capture in some parts with lots of inconsistencies in the 2D drawn effects...
Strictly for tradition.. replay system
now,i need to wait for this map and create some lineup😄
we gonna talk abt the claw in the barrier at the end????
is it me or I feel this animation have lower budget than the other trailers?
New agent leak?
Last me kya new character tha?
Clove the specter goat
anyway, replay when ?
2:25 wait so that means you can fall off the map? And die? Nice.
Riot really out does itself with every new trailer!
im dodging this
The way Iso reloaded his Sheriff. Ugh! 😩🤌🏼
let me guess, 2 bombsites that have 2 entrances and a long mid that you need to take first
Can’t wait to fall off of every ledge and walk off every cliff
2:51 that one guy who brings out the odin beause theyre losing, like an odin can stop these smurfs.
I saw pros commenting about an elevator on tiktok? I see none on this trailer though.
Give us more YORU in cinematics PLEASE!!!!
plz remove ice box for this
map reveal and possible agent teaser aswell for future ????
begging for campaign mode
Starting to wonder if riot will ever actually give answers about valorant lore
Another map for people to dodge because they didn't get bind for the 5th time in a row. :D
So the omen TP peek is now officially in the lore.
Is it a 3-site map ?.....
3:15 am i trippin or is that a new agent
I can't wait to put a cypher cable to catch people mid jump so they fall off.
This map looks like lotus split sunset and pearl combined fr
new  agent or is it omen at the end?
fracture 2.0
Riot should be producing some animation movies too.
This map has no edge, you will fall off the sides and in the middle if not paying attention. Like the pro player said in the reaction video "A map that awards good player movement". This map is going to be somewhat like an overwatch map where you can jump off the side.
New weapon?!
Why there is no yoru in animations 😢
Yeah
Are we SERIOUSLY CAN fell in the void now?? Ain't no way bruh imagine there's gonna be a troll that just jump off at every round
Is it just me or this animation looks like it was made in the paint?
omen with knife u will always be loved
3:13 who is this new agent?
This map looks gas. Like they are actually gonna make innovative cool maps like CS
Hmm, too many details of this fight, could have seen it with a replay system
i cannot wait to throw people off the map
the music tho! feels like i’m watching a real action sci-fi movie 🤯
I want to see yoru again in action
it looks. Kinda generic? Dosent seem to have a theme going on really. It just looks like a "place" Dosent even have a gimmick going on for it, like Bind, or Fracture. L map maybe...
cine los amo
I am excited to win on this map!
So many corners
3:14 new agent ?
Valorant should have a story mode or campaign mode, like this.
does this mean there are spots in the map that if you fall you could die?
We can fall off map?
New agent leak? Wonder if they can be seen inside the game while on the map
w
another one allready? lol but adds alot to omens lore.
Wow its almost looks like it was animated in replay system
If all enemies and agents have the same guns, who are manufacturing and distributing them?
1:50 report clove for using wallhack
did you see that rocket launcher the enemy was holding very suspicious
omen did the tiktok tp
Valorant Day by Day Updates coming Huge.....
is there gonna be a place in map player can fall off of the  map and die? hmmmm........
Wait is Riot finally cooking?
Agent teaser at the end?
amazing ❤‍🔥
2:24 can't wait to fall off this part of the map 100x
omg doctor freeze loves it
fire asf
Can't wait to watch my team fail the easy parkour
new map located at basically 70°50'N 9°00'W which is a small volcanic island near the north pole, in the artic sea, part of Svalbard, owned by Norway the island is called Jan Mayen i could be wrong tho but im pretty sure, it matches up with the whole icy mountain
The mage map🙄
So no one gonna talk about the end?
omg!!!
My teammate on their way to drop the spike off the map :D
Animation looks weird for some reason in my opinion
Did you see those sharp nails at the end! Shall we expect a new hot agent sir
Sage wall that rope thing on sound que ez kill
holy, the Omen TP peek
Ew bruh clove looks even uglier than ingame 0:26
Map would be better if we had a replay system.
so it's a map like haven but in the fracture void :0
FADE,breach,chamber map
Can't wait this game on console
I'm going to dedicate all my time to finding glitches and bugs.
cant wait to fall off tha map at 2:27
Embarissing so great,i cant wait for the new map of this❤
This one looks dope
Can't wait to fail the ledge jump and fall off to my death
omen missed with the knife is so me
Dammmm this is LITTT!!! I love the new map style! the jump rope, the tp peek, omen with the knife, and the Freakin agent Teaser at the end!!!! I can't Wait!!! This Amazing!!!!
OMG OMEGA OMEN
03:13 new Agent? Zombie mode?
3:15 we going horror mode @Riot?
Finally, they got iso! ISO is the best agent I like!
Sage: please care for CLove Clove: people play me all have good aim, that's why my winrate so high, and those who don't play Omen and Brim instead
А здесь тоже 12 этажей и в третьем зале ждать Крестителя? Какую пачку собираем ребятки? )
2:26 oh dont tell me this new map has a death pit?
2:26 Fall damage lmao
When will you put chamber in episode 😢
Ok this map is gonna be dope, I feel a little bit of haven's vibe
omg i loobe valorant so muchhha
Valorant mobile when ?
please lord, please... don't be awful
3 sites or 2 sites 1 mid I guess
2:01 I wish the gameplay looked like this.
why is the view 720x720
yo new agent maybe?
this finna be crazy dawg
IT'S THE LIBRARY!! THE VOICELINE
sooo... is it possible to fall out of the map now O.o
can i push my teammates off this map?
Looks like Agency + Vertigo ngl
LessssSHowThemthEMEANnnning Of fEaRR ⚠🥷
Now this map allows us player to die falling to the ground :v.
okkkk might be my new fav map, maybe? ... btw was that a new agent tease??
when will yoru have screen time
FInally Cold based character
Is Omen's voice actor different?😢
I gotta  say I'm excited  but also my laptop  is not repaired yet :(
can you die in the void?
The video is interesting, but the quality is indie-company level cinematics.. Look at their work on the presentation of maps: Lotus, Pearl 😢
Clove trolling throwing their spectre away for a ghost
1:01 is that a new knife or the araxys
little omen needed some galvanized square steel
New? Agent drop?
Immortal players egos: 0:26
Iso rework double tap leaked in this trailer made it like a strong move AND THE MOST INSANE THING IS BRO OMEN RLLY MISSED THE KNIFEEEEEEE !!!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!! BRO IN RANK IRON
new agent????
Game optimisation when🙏⁉️
Fighting thousand bots to get a suitcase or an objective would be insane.
This animation like an actual gameplay in the map but animated. I mean it looks really diff than the other animation.
wait but actually how would sage NOT know that clove is immortal at this point
Guys I don't think you are actually able to fall off the map. I think it was just for the cinematic.   After some time I realize how wrong I was.
i dont want a new map can we just have fracture, pearl, and haven back? stop adding maps until you fix the crappy ones we have right now. sunset needs a complete rework on b site so that cypher isnt dominate, and a site needs to be fixed so that retake is easier. the changes to breeze were horrid, and didnt really change much. can we just have better maps instead of more, and a feature to choose which maps we queue onto? im sick and tired of playing sunset six times in a row, followed by six more games of sunset.
44k views dead game
A new map and a new agent tease at the end too?
Finally we'll be able to die from fall
I want to believe that the hand at the end is Agent 8's hand, make him return with more lore 😎👍
vamooo mais um mapa confuso pra caralho
Oh.
FAKE OMEN TP?
this looks like that one bo3 map
I can already tell this is going to be a shi map plss valorant give us a good map
Reminds me of the infinity castle from demon slayer😂
None of these movies are as good as the first one
My favorite part was when omen looked directly at the camera and said "we will now be talking about the implementation of the replay system"
that was honestly pretty trash
No reply system
so this includes also releasing console and new map release
2:42 the rest of the video is the gaurds using regular guns like vandals buckies and spectres,i wonder if this is a teaser for a new weapon that deals splash dmg
sheshhh omen didn't have to did him so dirty
There's so many obstacles courses
ISO is by far my favorite
We want Spectre aim like Clove.
Omen is so wasteful, threw away two mags for no reason 😭
parkour map? really?
MAPA NOVO!!!❤
PACAR AKU WADJAHJWADDSA
what the sigma is going on
spectre 1 tap?...insane...
ARE U GUYS PLANING TO PUTT HAVEN BACK IN MAP ROTATION IN THE FUTURE
I’ll support ur new maps once you add the replay system
This map looks like a shrine from Breath of the Wild
WE GOT VERTIGO IN VALORANT
THIS NEEDS TO BE A GAME MODE!
New gun or just for short😮
So you can fall off the map now it seems
i would like to rate this map  a 7/10  -3 for too many corners
My man omen failed easiest knife😭😭😭
I already have tactic for this map Rusb B
My main is cokking fr fr
2:42 new gun?
Dead game Womp womp
new agent glimpse at the end :O ?
I really like the Destiny-vibes this map gives, legitimately excited for it
I can say this is a breach map. People gonna fall off lol
more like team deathmatch map
the knives on the wall
Uhhhh my gosh. The map is on a small island near Greenland. I don't think the location is real until search for it. "Jan Mayen" is the name.
3:10 Teased the NEW AGENT
did you guys see that monster in the end
spike map or warmup map ?
new animal based agent in the end?
No wonder they buff alots of duelist next patch. Look at all those angles. Its a nighmare xD
3:15 is this a new agent???
just show us the map bro 😭😭
Optimize the video settings pls, low fps
ew terrible trailer
wish we had a replay system trailer
More Omen!!
it's useless with fall damage point
Comments: We want replay system!!! Riot: 2:25
2:21 he failed the knife kill 😂😂😂
Is it agent 8 at 3:14 ?curious
1:31 they did the voice line thing
Omg
i HATED sunset but i gotta say this looks like its gonna be SOOO FUN
DID OMEN JUST TP CLONE PEEK THE DUDE..... WTF
why is the specter so strong
We can jump off the map now?
Im just saying, that thing at the end frozen inside. Has got to be Agent 8
Omen trying to knife💀💀
Is it just me or does this animation look a bit half arsed?
is this a TDM map?
another new upcoming Agent is in 3:09
Don't ever design a map this horrible ever again, Riot Games. This is SO TRASH I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!! You have been disappointing us for the past THREE MAPS NOW. ᠢ ᠸᠢᠯᠯ ᠡᠯᠢᠮᠢᠨᠠᠲᠡ ᠲᠬᠡ ᠡᠨᠲᠢᠷᠡᠲᠶ ᠥᠹ ᠶᠥᠦᠷ ᠹᠠᠮᠢᠯᠶ ᠢᠹ ᠶᠥᠦ ᠺᠡᠡᠫ ᠲᠬᠢᠰ ᠦᠫ. On top of this, you are the CREATOR OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. I CANNOT STAND THIS.  We are also STILL waiting for the replay system.
I'm sscared that all of my team is going to die to themselves on this map
why already another map bro, WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER MAP we need sunset and breeze GONE
Bring back replication!!
Ironically the comments talking about comments about no replay system are the comments talking about no replay system
finally found new way to deal w toxic teammates: *BODY BLOCK THEM WHEN JUMPING ON THE PIT*
YOOOO
Finally an ice-themed agent teased & probably be in the next Episode!!! I'm sure of it, lets gaur new map before Act 3 ends!!! 🥰
Rather have the old maps back but ok
bro they gotta make like a movie or smth and btw did yall see a new gun at 2:40
already can see grims sage walls here
Anyone else think they changed Omen's EN voice actor?
Clove vac ban please she was too good in this game.
nah man i thought kayo was gonna be on this trailer
This map is made in Abyss
What an ugly map
10k views. fell off
1:25 sick omen tp peak
pls pls let that be a new agent that is related to Omen
who's in the last in ice cube ?
Abyss is like Ascent but instead of being way above ground, you're below it, which is kinda cool tbh
clove using a spectre is a real valorant experience (they really do work best with a spectre)
This new Valorant map seems inspired by Vertigo!
new character? at the end?
wait whaat how many characters do they want in this game and is it Omen's sister or something 3:13
icy agent?
animation of this video just make 15 minute before release ?? just ugly :(((
The editing that went in to this video is enough to make anyone 💦
My Spectre doesnt do that
Oh good, I wish I could replay that but unfortunately we don't have a replay system yet
wait can you fall off?
riot cooked. lets hope its actually as good as it seems!
They will accidentally destroy the cell where agent 8 is being held. Be careful.
not a big fan of the added spells, clove smoke and grenade looked clunky
sweet, now throwers can jump off the map to make things quicker
Nah they dont need to go hard with the Background music bro 😭😭😭
in the end there is frozen omen or the monster?
These cinematics just keep getting better
It is me or this looks like sourcemaker animation?
3:08 New Agent
Where my boy fade and cypher at we got logs that they might be here
Super interest art styles. super interesting lighting. And, i dont know why, but I get the feeling this is gonna be the second 3 site map.
Maybe the powerful ‘thing’ Omen was referring to was the mysterious silhouette we saw at the end? Perhaps Agent 8 or a new agent we can play later? *Edit 70°50'N 9°00'W is a Norwegian volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean. New Agent is from Norway?
whos the guy at the end
I LOVE THE CLOVE SCREENTIME
At THE END BRO
Upgraded fracture.
im so excited to be able to look at the map in depth with the new replay system
I love how dangerous they make omen, as an omen main it makes me so happy
3:14 OMG AGENT 08
nah they are adding parkour things now 1:36
xd lol :v omg
Will be the 1st map with replay system
Who else is pumped?!
Clove????????😂
What happens whe you miss the jump
NEW AGENT TOO?!
looks like a TDM map
i dont really care about the map that much buttt THEY ARE STOPING WHILE FIRING which IS how you shoot in the game but its just that they never animate it correctly or they just animate them run and gun alot
Why does clove look so creepy ??
spectre buff?
Slayed with this map riot fr gj
dang
Woahh this map is so cool ❤
seems like small map with 2 bomb site.
CAN YOU ACTUALLY FALL OFF THE MAP?!?!?! :o
00:13 01:15 when omen will get the real answer, he just keep talking about it,  i hate it af
THE ANIMATION IS FREAKING COOL!!!!! LETS GO OMEN!!!!!
Other agents when killing: menacing, trashtalking, and others. Omen when killing: *"Boo"*
3:15 new agent or what?
hope its a pve mode (haha no way)
finally a map that actually looks like it plays different. hope that different is good tho
its ugly
3:14 wuts that😮
Now i wait for the Kanga video
Pov me and my team playing against some smurfs.... Iso Clove and omen.. NAH
new agent? crazy
New agent teased at the last?
It ain't a Valorant map unless it has chutes and ladders!
riot cooked on this map
The falling mechanic is so good
New agent leakkkk
no way its vertigo
Valla miierdon
animation is so bad compared to others
New agent whattt...Looks like omen though And the new map looks small and good
Japan???? Mount Fuji?
Underground map what country is this? Nepal?
Yup, I'm dodging this map
3:15 I wonder if agent 8 is coming out soon
this looks like an indoor type map
its basiclly split + lotus comnbined
2:23 bro was hitting backshots
Ahhh those replay system beggars finally fuvkoff
Zhonyas hourglass?
pretty good
Could that be a new leaked agent from that one!? Who's that thing stuck on that Ice?
So who’s the new agent in the end?
They added vertigo to val lol
Love that they showcase longer sequences of gunplay in this vid. It's always nice to see how the agents use their guns and abilities animated.
if there was galvanized steel and wood venner then the hourglass people wouldnt've fallen off
this map looks like it was made for krunker io like cmon bruh
In the end a new agent hint may be
Another agent teaser nice
Wait someone could hide on the rope bellow the map with a bucky for ez rat kills
I hope I don't have to play sunset for five times in a row
We need a show
Can Riot add this cinematic as a game mode?
Where is this map
1:23 omen actually uses the fake teleport strat for info
The 1st one with clove iso and omen
New agent leak ?
Cool
Shitbox 2.0
1:24 FAKE TP WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Since you've been waiting for it  REPLAY SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!
a gamemode with bots like this would be very cool
3:13 New agent leak?
@doctorfreeze
Little john finally saved up enough money to buy a house, but it was too small. Using galvanized square steel, eco-friendly wood veneers, and some screws that he borrowed from his aunt, he made it into a lively home for him and his wife.
Fan which country is this new map based on???
Por favor hagan una serie, tienen lore más que suficiente y sería épico.
love how this map is parkour based
As an Omen player I feel happy to see the best Omen moves in this trailer.
iso didnt get the newest patch yet
wait this actually looks kinda epic
when the upd is gonna drop?
Can't wait to accidentally fall to my death! :D
Nice, now give my man Iso a rework.
omgg this is why replay sistem is not release
3:15 new agent? or maybe he's agent 8
70°50'N,9°00'W      Norwegian volcanic island      Also an Antarctic island, likely having something to do with the monster at the end.
looks like a 2 floor map from the shots at the end. could be sick
Possible new agent leak in the end ?!
joda mani qué vaina e bacana
zombie mode i hope lol
Is it just me or this is the most low budget looks I've seen yet from Valorant cinematics 💀 I hope they didn't pay the same amount as the previous ones.
bro haven't changed iso yet (he still uses orbs instead of the new mechanic to be given in the next patch)
If they don’t have a section where you can jump off, to your death, I’ll be sad.
Is that new agent in the giant fridge? Or is another Omen?
glazing omen
How's no one here talking about 3:14?? The hand literally looks like omens'. Maybe an agent similar to him??
Whoa!!! I love Valo so much 0:36
HE OMEN CLONED IN TRAILER LESGO
Man, they cooked
If only we had a replay system to look back over the map
PARKOUR !
a real sanctum of secret would be a replay system
You gotta start hiring the other studio again, it’s better
2:25 Omen missed that knife:  Sage : Wtf was that!!? Iso : Well, he's trolling, i'm going to surrender
Omen being jollz knifing
justice for neet 2024 students
New meme pls, replay system ain't relevant no more😢
justice for neet 2024 students
If you can fall off the map. I'd be dead every round
NEW AGENT TEASED ?
when the dune music hit i was like *pikachu shocked face*
new character??
if this isn't teasing PVE I don't know what will
Was this both a new map reveal and a new qgent teaser?
Why does this animation feel unfinished? There a some scenes where the lighting and props feel dry/untextured?
There are going to be so many people dying to these pits 😂 The one where omen does the TP on, looks like you might only be able to jump onto it. Im not sure you can get off of the cliff without a movement ability, the ledges look too far/high up from the overhead shot. Maybe you'll be able to jump one way, with the slope, but not be able to go up. We'll see though  EDIT: You can 100% jump both ways no problem
i feel that hand figure is a new agent 3:07
clove is cheating
Wow that's a cool map! Would be nice to look at it with a replay system
this animation looked so bad i wouldve believed oyu if you said it was a fake leak, idk what you did but it doesnt look good
what about a replay system? no but honestly thx for all of ur work at riot
51:00 that corner
NO BOUNDRIES?? WE BE FALLING DOWN MAPS WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣🗣🗣
So new Omen agent coming soon and it looks like its a girl? Maybe his assistant, girlfriend, wife??
0:28 "lucky shot", 90% of valorant gameplay
New lore movie jaldi jaldi
NOWAY THE NEW AGENT IS AN ALFHA WOLF 🐺 🌔🌗🌒🌑AOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO     I'm so cringe
lmao
I want to know if there is actually some sort of platforming you have to do
gonna be fun watching all the Neons fall into the "Abyss" badum ts
Was that last part a tease to the next agent?
cool
much more reminiscent of a CS map, lots of verticality, loads of gunfights.
Yea this new animation style is not it. This cinematic doesn't have the charm that the other ones do
1:23 bro got CLAPPED
new gun ?? rocket launcher
Please Remove Sunset! We Need more MAPS like ABYSS.
Looking like a rogue company map
ok but like an actual unique map for once???? riot? is it opposite day???
FIRST 🧑‍🚒🧑‍🚒🧑‍🚒🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒
im ready for when valorant adds coop missions. that sounds so fun to me man
it'd be cool if we had a PvE mode against these guys
If clove is immortal, why is she playing like her life is on the line?
just add a replay system
Didn’t even knew there was gonna be a new map
gonna have so many teammates jumping out of the map to their deaths and i love it
i swear if there is death by falling off the edge im gonna hate this map for the rest of my life
Throwers having a field day today
new agent tease at the end? or is it lore related
fatty convention
Why is no one talking about the person at the end!? :o
Bro why they have grenade
SHEESH OMEN SO HANDSOME AAAA. Please Riot, do Skye & Breach cinematic 🥺🙏🏻
I hope there is this vertigo gimmick where u can just fall of the map lolz (very unlikely to happen since ascent exists but still hope)
THIS LOOKS SO SICK
My omen is really becoming the main character these days. They show him a lot more often. That tp peek in cinematic and the "Boo", I am really waiting for the end scene claw.. eagerly waiting for what they are cooking
2:24 Accurate Valorant Knife Range.
Bruh wheres kayo
The aesthetics look insane. Love the map already. Only thing I'm worried about, is that it looks like you can actually fall of in this one...
2:41 prowler theme 💀
yoo this map look crazy cant wait for it to be removed in 2 days
1:00 gaya and oni meelees, are they canon now?
Alr let's dissect this   So this seems like a two site map because when clove walks under the hourglass area it's really narrow so I doubt it will be a site, (hourglass is in the middle of the map), Omen goes on A site while Iso goes on B. There seems to be a heaven on A site leading from the defense spawn; think Ascent. Kinda like Fracture, there are two ways to get onto site it seems, this is a little farfetched but you see an upper area of A site with a bridge, a building, and another bridge connected from mid or defense spawn. There seems to be two layers of a part of the map because we see the people falling somewhere that's where my farfetched theory is from. Now B site is very close range which means this might be a bind type map.  I don't see much other than this, reply If u have theorys
W map
Another stunning trailer from the team. All the more reason for a Valorant series
finally a new undogde-able map, i can finally freak out once i get this map
2:28 me deciding what I’m gonna eat for breakfast lunch and dinner
Super hype
1:00 THE WEAPONS ARE CANON!?!??! 😭😭😭
New agent  ?????  3:15 ???
achei do balalaco
i can't wait for half my team to fail the rope jump and just die 15 seconds into the round
Now I can finally fall into the abyss
WOWOWWOWWWWW
Vertigo?
The claw at the end is agent 8 lolz
Something something replay system
Hey tarik which team are you going to jix this time😂
still waiting for replay system
Fake tp no wayy i am impressed🔥🔥
YESSSSS 🎉🎉. less line up map
If shes immortal why she using cover
How many people do you think will fall off the map on release? Since this map has "no boundaries".
Can't wait for my teammate to intentionally throw by jumping off the cliff
Omen really said I don't need sleep I need answers lmao
the cinematic feels like something from AliExpress
is it just me or does this starting to look worse
Why are they showing clove the meaning of fear
Meow.
Wow massive cooks 🔥
NEW AGENT AT THE LAST!?!?!?
Riot's cinematic are out of this world!!!
this map is gonna have hella gimmicks isnt it..?
A little bit Vertigo vibe
breach ult bouta be cancerous on this map.
Recently ive been having wierd ping spikes since the new update is that normal?
AINTNOWAY we can fall to our deaths in a map now!!??
This map looks sick
DUDE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE GET BETTER EVERYTIME, THEY USED THE FAKE TP PEEK!
Cypher WHERE?
new agent in the end ? my be
We playing parkour here now
W map
Hope this map doesnt get stale fast
D Site Reveal?
Wtf just happend jumpmap?
Wait so… It’s a map you can just straight up walk into the void with?!   Welp. Good luck, ranked players. Now you gotta keep your tilted teammates from leaping off. LMAO
New mam and agent
COOKED AND SERVED
Replay system
AGENT 8 IS HERE (HIS LOCKER HAS A SCRATCH)
What happened to the animation??? This looks good, but fan-made compared to normal tbh
Aint no way omen missed a knife point blank
Why clove half buy tho
wish they could let us play all the maps in ranked games so annoying to play the same map every games
Oooo this gives me fracture vibes
2:20 OMEN KNIFING IS CANON!!!
I think im gonna hate this map cuz of the platform and the pit
!
Im assuming the map mechanic is that you can fall off the edge of the map like what omen did. This might be another reason why raze satchel knockback was removed.
Love to see that they used the omen tp peek inside a cinematic.
Name one cinematic where omen doesnt look cool
fix your shop only 4 slots is trash
Now, make the game fun again and fix the stupid map rotation issues.
PVE valorant?
New character?
1:45  100% that wall that the hourglass agents break though is going to be a part of the map.
eye poppin
that ledge reminded me of vertigo ngl
Shh everyone. Let riot cook.
3:19 is it just me or is that omen?. OR A NEW AGENT
LET'S GOOOOO!!!
gonnna be bang for sure
Cypher didn't die once again!!!
I beg for more Yoru content, he is so cool looking
Any chance we get to use that RPG weapon ?
Mobile
Let’s goooo
looks like a cod map lol
omens swag🔥"monster is coming to you"
we really need a Netflix series of Valorant.
Omen missing the knife kill lmao
nice
Is this gonna be a map where waves of enemies come at you?
So you really can fall off the map
ماش
breh bring back old maps also
Somebody cooked here
Valorant mobile whennnn???? Dev dev
Cant wait to fall off
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2:12 Why can't my team ever have this confidence :(
I do hope they go back to their trademark animation style for the cinematics again, like SHATTERED and less like UNMADE (like they've got here)...because their style is what really hooked me and brought me into the Valorant community! I do understand this is just a little reveal though and the map looks amazing 🤩
Agent 8 coming
can u actually fall off the map?
Could the person inside the vault be agent 8?
im going to raze satchel all my teamates off the map this is going to be so fun
Please don't tell me the gimmick is that we can fall off the map 😭
They cooked here.
0:52 is literally agency from csgo
1:24 Omen did the thing!
1:25 the omen fake tppp OMG
the ice tank creature at the end is def our next agent. cant wait. maybe smth to do with locker 8?
I hope its not another sunset
Imagine doing that rope jump just to get catched by a cypher trap midair lol
New map and new agent??
Breach and raze about to be knocking everyone into the pit
W
This is clearly valorants best map yet, looking forward to the glitches
Riot low-key cookin rn 🔥
uhhh
gg vertigo 2
VALORANT VERSION OF VERTIGO??!
why does the clove smoke look so goofy tho😭
333
is it me or is the trailer really low quality
When did Omen come back?
yo they cooked hard on this
Bruh its early in the mornin fo this
This looks mad rushed
right when I quit playing
So, the new map is fallable? I mean we can dead if reach some edge of the map?
you can literally fall on this mpa? okay
cooked!
I wonder if you can get onto that ledge where omen missed his knife
yoo no cypher?
This map finna be 🐭🐁🐀🐀
Man that claw at the end was real dope glad I can replay it
Looks like the animation team was rushed for this one. Map looks sick though can't wait to fall off the map like vertigo.
nah that fake tp tho flex/doctor We made it
1st 300!
The leak says that this is the illegal manufacturing factory for radianites, as well as experiments to cause rebellion against the kingdom. Thats why theres a claw at the end. Basically, theres a third party for antagonists with extremist ideals
When is it coming out
omen when he tp behind the guy that "monster is here" omen: "poo" 2:23
My guy just did the fake tp 😂😂😂
2:02 it sad that Riot gonna remove the aimlab feature for a more friendly user skill in patch 8.11
Seems like a great map already
lets goooooooooo lets dominate the map
omen missing that knife killed me
DAWG U CAN FALL OFF NOW, WHAT! + A ROPE JUMP??? THEY COOKED
Bro my spectre doesn’t do that
This trailer kinda 🔥
clove hacking fr
Im so excited to see a cryogenically frozen, some kind of monster human to use gun instead of using their power.
pressed G while jumping :(
Can I just say that the animation in these trailers has gotten a lot better. We need a Valorant show or something like that
A nu map who byss? Lmao
Wow all of the replay system comments really went into the "abyss"
What's the hand
i wish my specter was that accurate
who was that at the end??? agent 8 ?👀
From a lore POV, I feel like this wasn't well planned out. The trailer doesn't really explain what secrets we're looking for or to who it is connected with, or am I wrong? Like it's obviously the same secrets Omen has been after the entire time, right, but did we learn anything new about these secrets?
2:28 imagine omen had some galvanized steel and wood veneer here
2:25 I hope we can make people fall in this map!!
Love how Riot is giving us this shorts made by Fortiche to quench the wait for Arcane
REPLAY SYSTEM?!?!!!???
"They're good. We're better." Bro ATE 😭 +10000 aura
cool map
New agent? 😮
VERTIGO ON VAL BEFORE GTA 6?
Kaiju maybe? Imagine if they made a PVE of some kind with that Lore drop.
cant wait to see this map in its full glory when the replay system comes out
This map is interesting. I hope they cooked
Rework viper
New agent at the end?
looks pretty nice, can’t wait to walk off by accident
Anyone know what country is this map?
so cute and petite
Did anyone else see the odd weapon one of the guards was holding? Looked like some sort of rail gun or rocket launcher to me. Could we have a new gun on the way? Who knows.
W map riot
W
IM SO GLAD I STAYED UP
I wonder when will they use fade again in these cinematic thing???
Who’s big spooky in the hour glass thing at the end?
the lave hate relationship i have for this game has no bounds
At the end... Thats Omen right?... Thats just Omen being a hostage... Right?
I'm so excited omg
That has to be agent number 8 is which means valorants show could be just as soon
2:30 is that tiny wall to step  available ingame??
Anti lineups map w
Falling through the map💀
Agent 8 release? 👀
amén
Bro i swear if tou csn fall off this map i am gonna die so much bro
오 6분전 ㄷㄷ
Valorant a.k.a. Riot games never fails in making exciting and thrilling trailers 💖😊 so excited for the new map!
Replay system here and mastery emote there. C'mon
Its only me or textures and shadows are very bad?
This Map would have looked better in the replay system
+3000 aura
haven't played in a year but ik at hyped
I need iso's type of confidence in my ranked games
The new agent is coming to valoran?
Omen with the fake tp… *chiefs kiss 🤌
Early yeahhhh
Why does the animation style keep changing, this looks ugly af. "Reckoning", "Warm-Up" and "Revalation" had the best animation style
Netflix series when?
2:29 Omen really said "Eh, good enough"
Please make a series🙏🙏
Glad to see Jett and Pheonix take a vacation and Cypher not getting f*cked anymore😌
1:53 clove wallhacking  Edit : DEAR VALORANT Can u ban racist players ? SPECIALY FRENCH PPL 💀
Can't wait for Reyna to 1 tapped from an op while lurking
NEW AGENT!?
Can't wait to fight against KJ and Cypher mains hiding with judges in all the corners!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
ayoo what was that at the end??? 👀
that one guy at the end seemed to be holding some sort of rocket launcher, maybe a new weapon?
Hopefully a map i can enjoy playing
W Map valorant  Well done
Maybe the replay system has been at the bottom of the abyss?!
i now understand why they nerfed raze bumping enemies
Finally new map!
A PIT JUMP TO A ROPE??? I’M INTERESTED YESSIR!!!
I feel like that map would look better with a replay system
Ability to fall off is wild
Nice
Was the last bit a teaser for a new agent?!😮
i was here!!!
Watching this makes me want PvE in Val
pls tell me there is actually a pit in the map that anyone can fall in cuz it's gonna be funny asf
Maybe new agent? Or new boss? New game mode?
Valorant PVE campaign pls
New agent in the hour glass ???
Yh they cooked when is the update ?
The claw at the end 😲
Idfc about the map but the reveal trailer was kinda sick
Fake omen tp went hard
The map for now looks meh
New agent teaser?
first
ngl, looks like a maze
no more replay comments we're finally past them 🙏🏽
Let them cook
IM SO HUNGRY FOR NEW MAPS
really wish they'd do map trailers and cinematics separately. Trying to do both just seems pointless.
when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back
Lame ahh trailer
We can fall off the map?
Woah! He did the omen TP peek
3:15 who??
IT'S HEREE
fire mapp look like a tdm map tho lmao Why clove throwing away her gun
<3
Boo
when Buff Phoenix ?
W 🔥
W 🔥
No npc replay comments  No more me saying console release  But no canadian agent, please be next 😢
I can't even memorize Sunset's layout yet T-T
Omen fake tp W
When will we get a replay system?
The fake omen tp is sick.
That rope jump T_T 1:33
When will there be teasers for the new agent?
2 minutes ago
There's a horse in the weapon showcase. New melee weapon is a horse confirmed
was hoping for a gameplay reveal trailer but whatever
46 second and 4 views only. This game used to be better😞
leakers -1  riot - 0
I WAS THE FIRST LIKEEEEE 🎉🎉🎉
Looks like all replay system comments went into the abyss
I wish my Spectre did that 😭
CS GO WOKER KKKKK
FINALLY!!!
We want Ascent back again!!😭😭
holy
seems like this map has so many angles
So... Technically a fusion of all existing maps into 1. Intresting
hype
The map would look real with a replay system
As long as it is not breeze, today is a good day.
REPLAY SYSTEM
clove and omen should be great pals
finally another valorant cinematic
So long Breeze!
When pearl is coming back?
Netflix series when?
