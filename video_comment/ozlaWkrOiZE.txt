😂😂😂😂😂stop cap ❤
The question is now
"Tiny Desk" ok
I truly believe Kevin got real bars when the camera is off.
It took me too seconds to Google this because the coments were no help. So this is to save someone else's time. This IS Kevin Hart. Appearently he raps now and this is his rap name.
this should just be called a Desk Concert
Tiny desk y'all lost mad respect from me putting this clown on here!!
More like "Chocolate droppa Big desk Concert"
Seriously though his flow growin even if he never did. Impressed with the spitz
For really real…some of yalls favorite rappers cant fade Chocolate Droppa. No cap, thats true freestyle off the top of the hat rack jack. I bet freestyle sessions with Kev are for real dope.
Can we give the band some plz!!!!
REAL NGA WITH A REAL HEART DAWG
Imagine walking into a casino and you see Kevin Hart sitting in front of a slot machine. He's emaciated and chained to the handle. The only words he can wisp out are, "do... you love slots? ... I do.." He feverishly keeps playing. Every time he wins, he lets out a feverish and bloodcurdling wail that would invoke the envy of the wildest of banshees. You don't know how to handle this. So, you walk away. He grabs your arm and stares into your soul with dead eyes, gaining energy from your shared gaze. His eyes bulge and his lips curl. He gasps, then whispers, "win... big..". Then suddenly, his mouth expands to the size of a dinner plate, protruding outward and inhaling voraciously. Bodies all around the slot machines start falling like dominoes. You look at their screens and notice that they had all just lost. Kevin Hart looks at you dead in the eyes and says, "I am now full. I can now leave." And then, he vanishes in a cloud of sulfur, gold dust and terrible jokes. The ritual is complete and now you are chained to the wretched machine in place of the last washed up comedian.
since when did tiny desk transition to a big stadium?
I actually watched this whole thing lol
Came here thinking it's Kevin Hart playing. Much to my disappointment, it's Chocolate Droppa.
Wait he actually just accidentally dropped some bars!  “Some time you gotta get graphic to be seen”

You don't get artists like Chocolate Dropper anymore. You can tell by the way he makes up his songs on the fly that he's truly a generational talent, a visionary genius, and an artist at heart.
Kev is Trippin, he won't quit.😂
2:08 he broke character on the far right😂😂😂
Man I can’t take Kevin serious for nothin !! 😭😭😭😂😂
This is Comedy 🏅
Kevin Hart ?😂
Diddy loves Chocolate Droppa
Drummer has some instances almost breaking character 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I'm so tired of seeing Kevin Hart everywhere. The fatigue is real.
tweakin
😎🔥
real talk, kevin actually smoothyly freestyled thru this whole thing while being funny, that ain't easy! he must regularly practice freestyling or his comedy chops are just that sharp or both. legit impressive
He should’ve performed the song he did with Trey Songz
I would Deadazz buy a Chocolate Droppa record lol
Don't threaten us with an album, sir! 🤣
Man's not hot lol

The 3rd track by Chocolate Droppa reminds me of Beanie Sigel's Look At Me Know
But, why he talks with the angry😢
Styles got switched 😂👌
They aint ready for droppa😂

Kevin hart tapping into different fan bases after katt williams
If you grew up with hoarder parents, this right here, is a normal room in the house.
That "let em out" has me CRYING😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5 4 3 2 1 😭😭😭😭
The hottest in the game right now
😂😂😂😂😂
Going to need you to drop that CD Kevin😘. The title " Not Ready for the Big Dog".
We got a Kevin Hart Tiny desk before GTA 6 😅😂😂
3:45 look dude on the rights face 😂😂😂
He’s shocking his own self with the bars 😂. I am entertained
Man's with the zap and Rodger adlibs 😂

Let me go jam that song with him and Trey Songz 😂😂😂
DROPPA WROTE WILL SMITH AND JAZZY JEFF GRAMMY WINNING RECORD! PHILLY LEGEND!!
He ran out of lines said stop😂😂😂😂🔥
Low key better than some of these mumbled rappers. Nick Cannon and him need to have a versus or rap battle.
Not even funny for April 1st.. kinda eww and ick honestly. Surprised Kevin keeps selling himself out like this
This is so good 🎉
This dude looks like Kevin Heart!! 🤣💀
Diss track or satire
Kudos to the band for showing out and keeping composure 😂❣️
Title is wrong, it should say "Chocolate Droppa: Desk Concert"
😅 chocolate drop dropping no  Gems 😂😅
Is it me or this is actually DOPE!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
welcome back kanye 🎉
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Styles got switched 🔥🔥🔥 We need that Droppa LP 😂
Oh god he’s so freaking funny 😂😂😂
C. Droppa is back😂😂😂
“I’m like a baby that’s everywhere/ I’m mean got my fingers in socket cuz I can’t rocket now I gotta lock it” - idek if I got it correctly cuz that flow was hard 😅
I know this all jokes but he was lowkey spittin tho
"Styles Got Switched"🔥💀
i was never ready for this
1:28 😂😂😂

the first song seems fire, seems like a prank tho, kevin hart can rap? idk
Ain’t gone lie love them for having some humor and bringing him in
Mark Normand went off. I can't believe it but I do believe it. Woah wow wait what?

😂😂😂😂
Yo why was the West Coast track lowkey hard?😭😭
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂🤣
Don't play with the culture. With luv
That first beat freestyle was alright actually
I get the joke, but I just wish this was a parody rather than a real tiny desk. Not only regard to the hard work the actual participants do, but also for inspiring musicians like myself who play multiple instruments and write actual songs. Had he gone through the trouble of intricately spoofing himself in some thought out material I might have felt different but this for me is a no.
We need Jay pharoah and iris spears next
Who's idea was this?! 😅😅😅
😂
CD is a legend! Casually Droppa a Hartful performance once again! He can't miss!
Why are we here? 🤣😂
No integrity for allowing this BS NPR! Tiny desk for real artists. Now it's a clown show 🤡
Droppa is more than just eating exlax and sitting on the toilet.
Thank you 🙏 tiny desk for this … it’s my birthday also
Real rap raw homie

Who let him out the house 😭
Ok , lets keep pushing the black man steriotypes , we already seen whats yall pushing we are not buying . Black people are done if this ignorance
The funny thing is, if Kev ever takes it serious and sit and tighten  up with the pen he wouldn't sound bad. But hey who am I to suggest anything to a legend like Chocolate Droppa 😂😂😂😂
I'm like....German 🤣🤣
Did they changed to a bigger desk??
Am I the only one that wanted to hear trapping all dayyy
This was golden Kevin is amazing always love how talented he is ❤
For Kevin that's just a regular desk
It's me reading the comments before pressing play, because "is this real, how real?"
😂 I thought I was tripping seeing Kevin
🤔So let me get this straight….  Y’all allowed Kevin Hart to do this yet y’all didn’t allow Lyfe Jennings to be on here???? Insane!!!! Yeah, somebody at tiny desk really don’t like Lyfe at all  because it had nothing to do with him not being a bigger artist, there are people that come on here all the time Who are very talented, but are not as popular. As a matter of fact, there’s a lot of people who are out of the spotlight and do little to minimum interviews..😒
Maybe do a tiny stage for comedians
I like when Kevin Keeps it Hood. ❤
Droppa here before Drake the game is cooked.
Yo man, at some points, the drummer looks so much like Kevin Durant and the guy on keys, Evan Turner 😂 3:30
OMG….. I can’t take him serious….😂😂😂😂

What a waste of time... & space! You all could have put Rare Essence or Northeast Groovers on here.. but y'all got this non-funny clown on here taking up space. 🤦🏾
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And my final comment on this video is the only reason why I gave this video a like is because I appreciate the producers of NPR for allowing us to have these music and entertainment experiences so that’s why I gave them a like on their channel as a fan I love and appreciate you guys I thank you for allowing me and millions of other people Who have subscribed to this channel to also enjoy these experiences, but this performance in particular was just straight trash and I’m definitely coming with a whole lot of music for you guys as well. I’m a music artist myself. I am so sorry y’all had to experience that that was just bad And I will definitely be dropping comedy, albums, and mixtapes just for not only my fans but for y’all as well, I will make comedy rap as well as my usual non-comedy, rap, and other genres of music. I promise y’all that I guarantee it because this was just absolutely horrible a little silly but the performance dynamic was just horrible. How do you begin an end a show not introducing your bandmates??? that was absolutely trash
GOAT hahahaha
And when I see the audience at NPR tiny desk, I’m not gonna leave them hanging that was super bad. I am so sorry y’all had to experience that and even the people here in the comments that was super trash.

BEATS WAS RAW BUT LIL KEV IS WACK!!! 💯
First tiny desk freestyle 😂
I love Kevin !
Unreal
He’s definitely from Philadelphia 😂😂
Kevin Hart in his stand-up special 'Let Me Explain(2013)' did say that Jay-Z and Kanye West had a bunch of pointless fire during their live concert shows while also hittin' the crowd with a bunch of pointless fire throughout that special, but Kevin Hart would be so proud of Chocolate Droppa for spittin' real fire with no need for concert special effects.😂 Bruh every time Chocolate Droppa started a different song, i was saying to myself in my head, "Get fire on these bi***es one time!" 😂. And all jokes aside the brotha's in the band were awesome, everything from the freestylin', the song variations to Chocolate Droppa's multiple rhythmic flows was crazy!!!👏👏👏👍
🐐
BIG DAWGS,😂😂😂😂, THAT BEAT FUNKY,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Long live chocolate droppa 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🥲
Don't mention ya top 3 without droppa !
Tiny desk looking larger than usual
Bathong Kevin

Kevin is a funny guy but I thought this platform is used to show musicians, songstress, singers that their contributions to the music world is very influential and greatly appreciated , Is this disrespectful????

This is great.
Yall shout out to the band they did they thing ❤

How does Kevin make time for all day nonesense and I love that Tiny Desk supported this. We needed this 😂
Did they really mess around and give Chocolate Droppa a Tiny Desk performance??
I was waiting for Frost Without You.

Wait this was on APRIL FOOLS DAY!!!! Someone needs to get promoted at that office frfr 😂😂😂😂
The fact they really gave this fool a tiny desk, 💀 😂

For a second I really thought Kevin Hart was like Eddie Murphy who had a singing career.
On the coool !! This was tough !!! 😂
Imagine Droppa and Aunty Hammy lol
5:55 talking about what? Who did this? 😅🔥🔥
How in the world did this band stay so focused and not laugh at this dude lol
this was actually so good
this should’ve been called this regular sized desk for Kevin😂
Not the “”make the song cry””😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think this the first time ever Kevin hart wasted my time and you know what?! I’mma stick beside him 😂
Nope.
I thought I was going crazy when I saw this
This was a good funny tiny desk concert
🤣🤣🤣 He Trippn😂😂
Droppa doing big thangs if he made it to Tiny Desk!!! The band with those beats… 🔥
I don’t think I’ve ever made this much eye contact during a tiny desk 😂
Tiny desk has become some bs. Lol
Kevin still raps like he's in 6th grade😂
Yasssssssss 🤏🏾🤏🏾🤏🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾😝
I'm not saying Kevin Hart is Chocolate Droppa but have you ever seen them in a room together?
What’s funny this is how Will Smith sounds 😂

He is getting his TONY. Kevin Hart is more of a larger than life entertainer. His stand ups are great but this is where he is the GOAT. Comedic improvising.. watch all his interviews, and live shows. He is GOATed for entertaining.
Respect to Kev man that was great entertainment 😂
Eat big Dogg…🤣🤣
Now I love Kevin but really tiny desk? But Lyfe Jennings can’t?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
AJAJAJ buen día de los inocentes
Does Kevin sound like Kendrick, or does Kendrick sound like Kevin?.... I'm so confused...lol

I started watching this because of Kevin 😂😂 Like when did this start?
*inserts the one clip of jay-z bopping his head, frantically*

1:59 he sounded like Druski right here😂😂
Glad the band didn't break when droppa dropped his drops, they were cool enough no one laughed even when they are allowed to, especially the talkbox guy, he compliments droppa's "barks" just like that
😂😂😂😂

Droppa is top 5 Rappers of this current Generation. This man don't even write he just goes off the DOME and he keeps the Chrome outside in the whip.
You lucky i fwy Kev 😂😂😂
Should be called Tiny mic instead
It was actually really really good!! No joke
I'm howling😂😂😂. Chocolate Droppa just pulled me out of my depression 😢😂
I call mixed kids chocolate drops. When kev had a youtube account over 10yrs ago, i made referrence to chocolate drops. Then he came out as chocolate droppa.
This actually wasnt too bad. I can dig it.
is this an april fools prank or somethin lolo
Really?????😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wonder if I can ever meet Kevin and chocolate drop at the same time .
Coco beware😂😂😂
Much respect for this. h going off the top. Droppa don't flop...

W Droppa
Is that a King Size Desk?

To go is to see 🤣  A nice distraction from the destruction of this world
😂😂
These musicians are 🔥 but I'm not sure what I just watched 😂
one way to distract from diddy affiliation
Why this hard though 🔥
This is offensive even as an April fool's joke
🔥
Naw now😂😂
😂😂😂
U can't fool us Kevin! We know it's u
I am watching this in the middle of the night trying not to SCREAM THIS IS SO FUNNYYYYY
Stop wasting  great beats.
That piano/helium voice dude is a whole character 😂
This is actually impressive considering he’s making it all up on the spot 😂 and somehow he’s not cracking and making himself laugh 🤣
How is the band not laughing? I'd be dead lol
The best performance in tiny desk 😅❤
The only time tiny desk was actually not so tiny 😂😂

Whoever suggested to get the 🐐 on here needs a raise 🔥
He actually ate tho
It should be called desk concert
Love the talkbox 🔥
kevin made the mic look big
What is this, a freestyle session 😅
We ain't ready for Chocolate Droppa
They should rename their channel  "Desk for Tiny"
This has to be a skit 🤣
April Fool's!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kevin Heart killed it for real hahah
Droppa, you should collab with Scarface. Face had the best tiny desk performance I ever seen until I seen yours. Droppa the world needs you, even if they are not ready….. 😂

I know this is supposed to be a joke but @tinydesk it’s a slap in the face to Lyfe Jennings to say his catalog isn’t good enough and then y’all come with this…. Be serious and stop disrespecting our legends
When the world needed him the most...he returned
Haha, I was about to comment “these artist names are getting silly now”

Chocolate dropped about to break the internet
😂😂😂
Real talk he needs to work on his freestyle comedy
Droppa
This guy kinda looks like Kevin Hart
Screaming 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He said he met the band outside lol they just hanging out in front of offices 😂😂😂
Remember when you reminded diddy he was on camera
bro is definitely not J cole😭😭😭
Droppa for the win 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kinda slap tho!  The band 🔥.  He bout to be talking mad noise now to nick cannon and other rappers that have not received the invitation for a tiny desk
first thought seeing this thumbnail:  why bro look like Kevin Hart???
30 yrs from now you will always remember where you where when tiny droppa did his tiny desk
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ I needed this. I love Kevin hart so much
Hahaha I was so confused by it all!!😂
CD is the coldest out their on god!..
🫣😶‍🌫️
I met Droppa back in the day before he started rapping. Little little bro was working at a Hershey's factory.
Dis ninja wild 😂
🤣🤣😭😭😭What did I just watch?
4:34 ❤
April fools!!!
Supahot fire got 2 hours to respond
Somebody said it’s Large Desk
If you don’t think this man is funny, see a therapist to uncover the trauma that makes you unable to laugh 😂😂😂  Cuz he is unhinged on another level
😂😂😂😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHA got me good...
Are these songs all freestyled?
I thought this was kevin hart also lol
Kevin calls this a "desk concert" 😂
The fact that Kevin actually did great is...I have no words lol. The Band of Brothas is amazing, as always! Great job, guys, bc this was funny, amazing, AND confusing! Thank you for this lol
i need the album
🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Who asked for this? So I know who to blame...😑
Kevin Hart raps like Eddie Murphy sings😂
This band is straight 🔥! Droppa keep dropping. One day you're gonna crush something. 😂

I thought I was racist when I saw the thumbnail and was thinking this looked like Kevin Hart.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was cool, but I kinda wish he had written some stuff ahead of time.  The freestyling got a liiiiittttle rough…
I can’t believe they have someone so underground booked I love it
No way🔥😂😂
Given Kevin’s size, this just a desk concert 😂
this is like a sketch. I want to do this character. But I look normal and hot

Yall picked him over Lyfe Jennings
"Droppa, where u BEEN?!?"   STREETS BEEN FIENDIN' SON! 💪 On gawd frfr no 🧢 its been a crazy drought out here! 😅
STILL WAITING FOR THE ALBUM
I thought it was a Tiny Desk Stand Comedy up only to see Kevin take it away
lol wth 😂😂
Choosing to freestyle when you only have one shot, at such an iconic venue, takes some serious confidence. Not shocking Kevin killed it though, given his wit.
What is the  name of the first beat ?
Adam sandler x chocolate droppa collab needed
Made my day 😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
WHAT THE HEEEEK 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉😂🎉😂
Why didn’t he do his actual songs
The producers and the team at NPR are very smart for putting this together! This...this is a masterpiece! 😂🔥  And the band is for real killing it! 😄🔥🔥🔥
Bruh this was toooo short, i loved this
Best April Fools ever
i was waiting for kai or druski to pop out and turn tf up

2:24😂😂😂😂kev is a fool
Chocolate droppa sounds like hes gonna poop his pants 😂
I’m mad at him for not performing Frost Without You smh
I was hoping for frost without you😔
😂
Day one fan 😂
😂 saw this yesterday and thought: uh uh am I dreaming? Finally watched today and haha 😂  got me real good
“Small feet, big heart is what I got” is a wild intro lol
Nice one 😂
Ppl can't recognize real hip hop anymore. It's sad. He's so underrated
Nothing but respect for Kevin hart, but the fact we got this and not lyfe Jennings is insane
April 1st is officially Big Droppa day !!!!
I couldnt resist to add a like 😂...Game change
Bro 8:19😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 twista flow

Droppa is back!!! I like the part where he said "Im not them". Real.
Is this Kevin Hart? He's a dead ringer
What does the first best sound like? It's from a song like "ahhhhh, now we do it" or something like that. Help me out!😤
We not ready and when I say we I mean the people I'm with when I'm over there. But I'm not there. I'm here. I'm not them. They not ready, but we're ready. We showed up. And when I say we I mean the people I'm with when I'm HERE. WE'RE HERE. WE'RE READY. Chocolate Droppa, we're HIM. ❤❤❤

So @kevinheart @Chocolatedroppa as a fan, I love you, as a music lover, I love you, but as a lyricist, we need to drink some lactose free milk. Because As you were rapping, my musical brain came up with better word choice. I'm a nobody. But im somebody.

Hello, Humans Beyond the stars holds more truth, than what humans speak on a regular basis.  TERRANCE OUT
Still better than 80% rappers😂
Chocolate Droppa look a lot like Kevin Hart though. Does anyone feels the same way?
How was this actually that good? I really liked the bars i don't know how to feel
Don't F*** with Dem was my grandma's favorite song. On a summer evening she would play the record and sit out on the porch and sing along.
How did npr manage to get a hold of droppa??..
chocolate droppa like the one that stick on yo trousa
Nah this is insane. 😂
First Concert in tiny desk that doesn't seem crowded

Chocolate droppa came thru 🍫❤
This was corny. He does  anything 4 attention, a bunch of non funny force jokes  where a real comedian at Katt Williams
nah but that first beat by the band was insane 😭🔥
Shout out to the band because the improvisation is A1 😂
"Dre waddup, not talking about Dr. Dre, I'm talking about my nephew." 😭
I saw the miniature I knew instantly
Chocolate
You’re remarkable at what you do!
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🤣😎😎
Chocolate Droppa: He stole this whole skit from supa hot fire for years and never gave him credit for it. I can't respect that.
All jokes aside he definitely was riding the beat in perfect timing
Big respect to the band for not laughing off and forgetting their cue
I love Kevin Hart, Thank you
The Real Rap Raw project gone be 🔥
That was painful to fast forward through
This isn’t tiny desk. This is regular sized desk
For second, i thought this was Kevin Hart.
Tiny drop before GTA 6
Tattoo on my back that says Not Them 😂😂😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is the best tiny desk yet 🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Insane 🤣📈

We love you K❤😂😂
That first bit was crazy 😂🔥🔥
Gives mid-life crisis in the best way possible
No we not ready Kevin😂
I thought that was fred durst😅

He though the was on Wild n out cut the beat
droppa is the realest. he was killed two months ago and still didn't miss this performance
This guy 🤣😂🫶🏽. Genius!
Real Rap Raw!
For sure there was some conversation like "But don't make a big joke out of tiny desk,... It's only been for the best musicians in the world for about 20 years straight ..." And he was like "No, it'll be good... I swear"
The emotional breakdown @6:43 onwards is sooooo hilarious coz musos stay having therapy on these stages mid performance
He's funny, this guy should try being a comedian
Kevin is too much 🤣😂🫶🏾
april fools ? loooooooooooooooool
He's so BIG!
This is exactly how I freestyle lol. Without the profanities tho ;)
I saw the thumbnail at least half a dozen times, and then finally clicked to make sure my eyes weren't tricking me.
This fool, straight bars
I'VE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST😭
We got Chocolate Droppa on Tiny Desk Concert before GTA 6
Legit only half a foot taller than a dude sitting at a low drum set. Crazy work
I'm dead 😂😂😂
I can’t believe he left “Frost Without You” off the set list but three originals ain’t nothin to complain about   My boa Chocolate Droppa finally getting his due
Used to work at Universal Studios Hollywood and one early 7am morning.. I came in heading to my world when all of a sudden.. chocolate droppa came over the park’s speakers😂
Raising money to free diddy?

A straight masterpiece
Who got fooled though? We just got a new tiny desk performance from a top selling artist.

Chocolate droppa tiny desk before gtaVI
tiny desk is just a regular desk for kevin hart
Chocolate dropped vs super hot fire still waiting
He can make a mockery of hip hop, however others are crucified. So many other natural talents could have gave us a better moment in space. S/O to the musicians, get your $ and publicity others
He really looks like Kevin Hart
8:20 had to pause to laugh
Tiny Desk said April Fools fr
NO WAY!!!! April FOOLS EVERYONE!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♀️🔥🔥🔥

Y'all really do play a LOT 😂

Boooooooooo 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 I’m very disappointed in you guys.  For having this piece of garbage on your platform. Do you know that he crashed the car with his friends on the side of MalHolland Drive in Hollywood. He left him to die while his body bodyguard carried him up the in embankment like Whitney Houston. Kevin Hart is an unfunny mfr. booooooooooo npr 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅

I remember back in the 90s, life was hard, I was lost, confused, just down on life, and then it happened, I heard Droppa for the first time, and he made me realize that the radio was still on.
That beat at 8:00 is 🔥
Min 5 goes crazy tho haha

The name of the Love song is called Love song. 😂😂😂😂
Now more than ever Kevin needs Patrice O'Neal around to clown on him so he doesnt do garbage like this.
Is that shaq’s little boy?
It should be chocolate droppa on The Desk 😂
I'm not them, they're over there thereeeee 🎵
Big 3 who?
Droppa being left of Carti is a crime.
This pist me off until I realized it was April Fools Day. Ok, Kev.
Listen! We don't even deserve this 😂.
Gotta be honest I wish it was hannibal
Chocolate Droppa could be Kevin Hart's twin!  😅
Yep ...I missed ya ! an I wah'nt ready for dis
April fools will never be the same again !😂. He killed it
3:41 The guy's reaction in the back killing me😂😂😭
Droppaaaaaaaa 🎉
Tiny Desk managed to get THEE CHOCOLATE DROPPA and he didn’t perform his smash hits “Push It On Me” feat. Trey Songz or “Baller Alert”?! 🗣️ WE WANT PART 2! 📣

I know it’s supposed to be funny for YouTube but kinda messed up you give him 10 mins to mess around but you didn’t want to give us lyfe Jennings because you think he is a nobody is crazy
Haters gonna say this Kevin Hart.
Kevin was going in
How can you not love NPR Tiny Desk?😊❤
Why does it look like the DESK is actually pretty big on this episode 😂
Or even Racoma. Trust me.
I'm ready to eat
Please let WILLIS perform next. You won’t regret it!
Cmon Kev... Band of Bros the real MVPs tho. Ain't no way I would have kept a straight face.😂🤦🏾‍♂️

5 feet high and rising
This is GENIUS😂😂😂😂😂
What did I just watch?!?!

Gonna need a smaller desk to keep the name when Choco Dropper rolls thru.
Grew up listening to Chocolate Droppa. I'm glad he's still dropping bars 🔥🔥🔥 Real Rap Raw!!!
April Fools 😂😂😂
Chocolate Droppa is the Greatest Person to ever put 2 Words Together🔥 Shakespeare could never💯
Dangit!! I was hoping he was going to do “Bum Bump Got Me”……. Smh, only real ones understand…
This man can’t miss …
Now that's the Tiny Desk concert I didn't know I needed Real Rap Raw Droppa!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m DEAD
That last beat crazy band 😮‍💨🔥
I swear chocolate Drop has a track with Waka Flocka on a DJ Drama tape. I’m a hater? Something like that.
That was awful. 😂😂😂😂😂
“let em out” 😂
This is the silliness I needed today! Thank you npr!!!!😂😂😂😂
This has to best April Fools joke ever!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Out of all the talent and underrated artist out there they get this dude smh
“Sometimes you gotta be graphic to be seen…” Chocolate Droppa made my day
I remember when his first album dropped in the 90's, few artists have had the impact CD has had.
Missed opportunity. This vid and performance would’ve had longevity if he had actually prepared comical bars. He could’ve gotten Luda, Lil Dicky, and Eminem to help him with some 16s … would’ve shocked us all AND had us laughing while also covering the different regional styles…. What a shame.
This dude's fake music career made it to tiny deak before my real one. 😂😂😂😂 This Legendary lol
Band killed that last beat😂
People were saying this is Gen z's Tupac I can see why. Crazy Lyrical Ability 🔥
Where is the Em & Hart collar?😂
Missed opportunity to have the very first and only big desk concert
The band was making some slaps them beats fire.
This is Great for the 1st of APRIL😂😂😂
Drops of bliss, your not ready.
“I’m like a baby that’s everywhere” really hit me deep down
Puts the Tiny in the Desk

Lol noooo.......
Bro this new guy is kinda good! Can’t wait to see him live✨

Zuck wish he got these kinda bars

Bars on top of Bars!!!
Droppa so underrated
This sucks!
That last flow was top tier 🔥🔥🔥
On a real note “love song” has so much potential.
Diddy party goer
Still better than Lil Mosey
Kevin Hart's commitment to the bit is unreal
“Bout to take everything like a frog”
The keyboard players face 😂 They all trying not to laugh!   I was waiting for him to perform "Frost without you" this was good 😂😂😂😂
Why he drop the same day I drop though 😂😂😂
They're not ready men 😂😂😂
Man Tiny Desk has such a special place in my heart. It’s for real music then Kevin  just comes through being corny as he’s been for the past few years 😒
Basically the best April Fools Day EVER! 🔥
Big desk concert
If T-Pain would have pulled up....
Why❓😂
Everything is vain! MSFT
i hope this inspire kendrick to come
Droppa is most definitely a FOOL.

They ran out of artist 😂😂😂😂
NPR Please bring us HARRY MACK.

Where is Frost without you?
Ngl the love song was actually fire 🔥
WHO DID THIS!? I WANT NAMES!!!
No BS I used to watch Chocolate Droppa videos when I was depressed and it helped me get through those times. I would be crying laughing and that release helped me face another day. So thank you Kevin Hart.
😂😂😂😂😂
I can't believe I almost didn't click on this
Sheesh, if i was Lyfe Jennings i’d actually be upset
Oh my god💀
Real Rap Raw Tiny Desk before GTA 6
I remember the first time I heard Chocolate Droppa... It was today. But the point is, he changed my life.
WHO thought this was a good idea??? Give them a raise. Droppa is the truth 😂😂😂
i thought this was AI April fool. lol
😂😂😂😂
Drake?
NPR Tiny Desk continue to prove that they are the most talented BTS crew in history
MY MEN!
This is a bummer for day one tiny desk fans. I get it's a joke but you used to put on for real up-and-coming artists and introduced the world to so many amazing acts. This platform shouldn't be for an A-List comedian
Bruh 😂😂😂😂😂
Listen…the band didn’t come to play though!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂dude crazy😂
I saw this thumbnail last night and just realized this is fkn Kevin Hart😂 I 4got he was Choc Drop! LoL
Still better than 99% of music for these new rappers!
AJAJAJAJAJAJ q es estooo

THE FACE OF HIPHOP, W CHOCOLATE DROPPA FOR ACCEPTING HIS OWN TINY DESK
Second backtrack was fire

Lol, work, work, work
Ok but why does this go hard?
😂😂😂😂
The video description goes hard too
Why did he actually eat… when’s the next album?!😭😭😭like fr
Tiny desk? Looks normal sized to me, but maybe it's because of chocolate droppa's being the same height as the red m&m
Perfect April Fools Content 😂✊🏾
😂
Now we need a track with Chocolate Droppa and Fisticuff. That would be 🔥!
Idiot😂😂
now this is Drag💅🏿 cause who is this gangsta
Before Lyfe Jennings is crazy lol
Droppa album was the first one I ever copped.  He helped me elevate my mindset.
This man is a fool 🤣🤣🤣
i am so happy to see Chocolate Droppa's music evolve and end up on tiny desk. Been here since day one
Bro is that RZA on the drums
Ok but why was this kinda ok…
saved to watch later
i don't think they're ready, man
April fools big desk concert lol 😂
I saw this guy spit a few bars for Kendrick one time. It was dope.  He kinda looks like Kevin Hart lowkey
That reminds me today is my grandma’s birthday. She turned 89 and she drives more than me. 😅
This man is a mess... Lets Go Chocolate Droppa!!!! 🥷🏾🥷🏾💃🏾💃🏾💙💙🍫💉
The pianist is taller and he sitting down.
The Band of Brothas!
Who wrote the description? Hilarious! Well done ✨😂
I thought Bron was joking 😂😂😂😂
Why mess up a good tiny desk segment
hot take: he's actually freestyling better than rappers
This brought tears to me eyes! I grew up on C.D.! It's good to see him finally get recognized on this platform! I think a collab with Carlos Miller would be dope! 🔥
😂😂😂😂
loooooooooooool He NEEDS to Drop an ALBUM FrFr! lol
Today, it's just a 'desk concert'
I swear they made the desk bigger for him there’s no way 😂
Thought it was a April Fools.
Why do i see cholcate droppa and will smith making a hit song

Entertaining as usual, yet confusing as Heck 😂
Bro he definitely freestyled this whole thing
THE GOAT RETURNS YOU WANTED TO WRITE HIM OUT OF HISTORY. DROPPA SUMMER
its dope that he did this on Tiny Desk, but alot of the rap jokes and references went over their heads. He shoulda did this at a 95 South show or at an awards ceremony. The jokes were better than the audience's response
The 3rd song had me dying 😂😭 Lowkey slaps 💪👌
This guy! lol
💀💀💀
Off the dome is crazyy
Idk how the band kept it together. I would have been 😂
April Fools 😂

Shoutout to the producer who came up with this idea for April 1. Brilliant!
Happy that Tiny Desk is giving smaller artists like Chocolate Droppa a chance. You guys are awesome.

"I'm bout to take everything like a frog."

Whoever is responsible booking this !! I love you 😂😂😂😂. I needed this

When they name a desk after you, you already won in Life.
A 10year callback is INSANE 😂

As a singer... He's a great comedian 😅
Kevin Hart is to humor as Kevin Hart is to music.

Man, my pops and I saw Chocolate Droppa at the Aragon Ballroom in the early 2000s. One of the best shows I ever saw. He’s been underground for that long. Truly special artist
Authentic Tiny Desk performance😂
Lol
Bruh gotta another movie on the way huh?
I was playing this while studying not even knowing this was kevin hart
I love ya NPR but honestly Kevin Hart isn't funny.
Whyyyyy Tiny Desk but I soooo needed this 😂😂😂. Get for April Fools day 😂😂
Now that’s an April Fool😂❤
lol this was so good
😂😂😂 Why was I boppin' with the first flow, though!!
"BAP BAP MINK MINK THATS A GUN HOMIE! WHAT YOU WANNA DO? GO AND RUN HOMIE!" they don't know chocolate droppa fr 🙄😂
The worst best Tiny Desk ever!!!! thank ya'll for bringing this fool to April lol.

He's a whole April fool 😂😂😂
Ughhhhhh must I be subjected to the "N" word on NPR?  👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
He didn’t have to do this.  He just loves to work😂
Even chose a tiny mic hahahaha
Low-key the worst entry in a long time. No hate, but it was mostly ranting, barely 4 minutes of 'music'. His back-up band sounded nice, but the vocalist only seemed to have an axe to grind and an ego to account for. And with an ego that tall...Hart's freestyle falls so short it's cringy. I always appreciate the artists who are humbled by Tiny Desk.
He improved.
Yo 💀
Genius
😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Nah this went hard frfr🤣🤣💯

To Kevin it's just a normal desk :)
omg why he ain’t do his collab w/ Trey Songz ?
I thought that guy was a comedian.....and when he started to perform,  I knew it 100%.
At the thumbnail I thought,......Wow he looks a lot like Mr. Hart. 😂 Then I saw the group name and we all knew.  Broke the record for cursing at Tiny Desk
April 1st
🗣️ Big dawg gonna take that bowl 🗣️
Why was this lowkey good??!!
I was staring at the thumbnail for a long time like 🔎 that looks like Kevin Hart
He Pulled up with the play ground rap book
Big Poopa

Great April Fools Joke
Droppa Where Ya Been
Perfect April Fool’s 😂😂😂😂
I was about to say this is an insult to the platform and then I remembered what day it is. Do you think Hart understands the comedic irony of him being a massive corporate sellout on NPR Tiny Desk or do you think he thinks he just doing a funny bit about freestyling?
His XXL Freshman Freestyle still top 5 😂😂😂
Nah this guy is trolling 😂😂😂
Oh my goodness 😂😂😂
Aint no way ......
“I mean I got my fingers in a socket, cuz I can’t rock it But I gotta lock it And now whatchu gonna do, crock.. oh!”😂🔥🔒
Watched the whole video.  No chocolate was dropped during the entire performance.
DROPPA!! 🤣🤣🤣
