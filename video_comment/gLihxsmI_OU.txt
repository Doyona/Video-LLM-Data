ok that looks sick tbh
Ok anyone give me prime video subscription?
Probably an anthology to double check which series are the most popular, and could've been great, until they doubled down on DEIB again by including concord.
Honestly I am so sad cuz some episodes were so good but some were so bad
Amazing show for sure.❤️👍
😊😊 really nice stuff.
This is so cool. Amazing stuff.
Honor of Kings is not a great game but have a really goated animation company, truly derserved in this list
i dont get it, i cant find this on Steam. What is the name of the actual game
Gives "love, death and robots" vibes
Hope the next season we can get a Titanfall one !! Great show.. Good nod to the old gamers out there. An new.
waiting season - 2 impressive outstanding series
Outstanding secret level marvellous fabulous series time i am watching waiting- season-2  impressive series
Watched the series. Good, even if I wasn't familiar with some of the games. Would love to see a second series with Starcraft, Half-Life, Bioshock, Total Anhillation, Wizardy, HOMM to name a few.
will Who? hes such a putz. who the hell would ever tale any advise from him?
PAC Man?
2024.
George Washington  Typhoon
HECK nah. We want a HALO MOVIE!!!!!! ✊
Is there gone be a season 2 😢
Does anybody wanna get on my "secret level" (wink, wink)?
What is concord
What their doing with computers these days, it's no wonder why you see so many popular actors doing commercials.
Your new world game doesn’t deserve a spot and neither does concord
How do you even describe a pitch for something like this? After watching a few episodes, it’s insanely cinematic, psychedelic and mind-bending… What a masterpiece.
Intro with 40k, you win.  We all win.
And they shall know no fear! Idgaf after playing space marine 2 then watching that. I tucked around and thought I was the main character
CGI looks like its from 1990, FAIL. and why do they have goldeneye n64 faces!!!
DECEMBER?? Why so far?
Is this like Ready Player One?
Sooooo....  Every video game is now an Isekai?
FOR THE EMPEROR
0:14 China? No thanks. I will not be supporting anything pro-China
Это сериалы вышли или нет
Armored core, warhammer, unreal tournament, mega man and dungeons and dragons were the only good ones. The rest are garbage.
I hope the series will be great
Quién más lo vio por lo de waharmer
where is jin sakai?????? 0:51
This was fantastic, really amazing
Osm
Wth where is our boi Kratos just for one second
I love the stories love death and robot be making its so thought-provoking so wild wish they keep making more episode for both I especially like how they are short
i wanna see more of kratos and jin sakai
This is the worst series i ever seen in my life
THIS IS LIKE READY PLAYER ONE BUT BETTER
Man see warhammer Man happy Man watch
👍👌
God of war, halo and doom all seemed to have been teased but cut :(
BY GAMERS...FOR GAMERS!!! 💪🏼😎👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Oooooo adventure unbelievable
This is going to be superb same as the previous series.
0:49 Kratos
Why aren't more people talking about this!!!! It's amazing
I hope we can get more season this is brilliant and awesome. They can tell stories for much games. Amazing work. But to be honest when I see Kratos I thought there is will be a eposide for God of War but it was just a cameo and this eposide was final eposide of season 1 and this felt a little bit sneaky but still okay..
Kratos 🤩
After watching the show, whoever made this trailer deserves a raise. They managed to make this trash show look good
the cut the god of war one. And i KNOW halo was featured in one of these trailers too. its been cut as well.
Nah id love to see 1 episode of a helldivers mission like full dramatic and a lot of deaths in just 40 minutes maximum bc thats what a mission last in game
Why is the white man always the chosen one in these
I hope they add Little Nightmares in S2
I would like to state that the kratos and jin sakai were FUKING BAIT. And that's really fuked up of you guys
Bro why was jin in this trailer but not in the show???
EPICARDO 😮
As a Netflix subscriber I'm kinda pissed, but you can't blame Amazon for wanting this kind of content too
we want League of Legend
Since season 2 has been confirmed I wanna see Dead by daylight  Plants vs zombies (original or garden warfare) Smash bros (Mega man got in)
Wow this is the great venture by Amazon, I love how they focussed on story oriented games development instead of console/hardware gimmick like Google did
Boring
6/10 the show is full of bullshi there's a few episodes that i like but the show is bad
Amazing content as always!
what if they make temple run?
Which episode does ghost of tsushima show?
U lied to us ! apart from the graphics , and some cool designs (5% of all designs) , nothing was good , the pacman/megaman/PS episodes were total bullshit n I was waiting so bad for them. they scammed us ! most episodes were a total joke. some of them didn't even last 6 mins ! like the megaman ep. !! no story ! and where's Jin from GOT ???!!! fkin liars !!
What a series 1 to 15 outstanding series superb thx waiting next ❤   All episodes outstanding what a series space adventure & ep - 5, ep - 10, ep-9, ep-11 to ep - 15 outstanding one marvelous action, cgi, vfx,  ultimate extreme series created. - thx to tom Miller ❤❤ waiting nxt
What happened to Ghost of Tsushima!?
Darth Plageus in the thumbnail?
I watched all episodes. Where is GHOST OF TSHUSHIMA???!
0:50 why is kratos in America?
Where’s God of War? The second half released and there is no God of War as teased in this trailer.
Waiting - 2  Secret level - ep - 6 Keanu Reeves entry fabulous outstanding action superb ❤
I see no Battletech, what gives?
I like how it is a list of almost entirely trash games... and then Mega Man.
This is one of the best trailer i have ever seen 🤯
Extraordinary series
Secret level - goosebumps action  child story ep - 5    ep - 4 min blowing outstanding robots fight action  😘😘 outstanding extremely 🔥🔥
action outstanding   Clean & clear What a series cgi vfx look real  outstanding ultimate extreme ❤❤ outstanding series ❤❤
So I just looked at the list for the remaining episodes and there is no god of war or ghost of Tsushima? Maybe a second season in the coming months?
Is halo too?
Im so disappointed that concord's series was cancelled       Not sooner
So this is how they feel out the market, which ever episodes get most views will go further in production? I clicked on the first ep thinking I'm starting a new show and then realizing there is no ep2.. this is a whole different level of rage bait..but its my fault I guess, never read what it is about..bc I don't like watching trailers or "about" before a show, I always go into the dark..
I just watched the pacman episode. This series is going places.
What a weird selection of games. There may be 5 out of 15 actually interesting. Guess it is patroned content to promote stuff, as there are some really weird games while skipping a lot of legendary games. Concord making it more obvious than anything else. Also Crossfire... But no Half Life, Doom, Diablo, Street Fighter... or a lot of other great games known to everyone that could have been chosen instead.
Que pedazo de obra de arte ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Le dieron un capitulo al juego de mierda concord pero no le dieron un capitulo a juegos como god of war,mk,the last of us y un gran etc
If they made a whole season of Warhammer 40K like this I'd be willing to pay cinema prices for each episode.
Some more ideas;  Titanfall Cyberpunk 2077 Detroit: Become Human Red Dead Redemption Super Mario Mafia Call of Duty Resident Evil Mortal Kombat The Witcher Metro Borderlands Hitman Life is Strange Portal Wolfenstein Doom Destiny Dying Light World of Warcraft
God they need a helldivers one🙏🙏😭
0:50 Kratos..GOD OF WAR❤
I praise you Commander Titus of Ultramarine ! For The Emperor !!!
oof... concord better be the best episode ever
Honor of kings!!!
this version of pacman should get its own game
This show was 100% trash.
This concord episode gonna flop just as hard as the game🤣 that warhammer 40k thoooo😍
spelunky 🙏
wtf is up with the plagueis thumbnail? bro a peeping tom
Okay, I'll tell you a few negative elements of the series First of all, the episodes are very short, they could have been longer, about 30-40 minutes or so, I think it would have been much better. Secondly, there should be many more game characters, let me suggest you a few game characters, you can make their stories:  1. Splinter Cell: Sam Fisher and Victor Coste 2. The Witcher 3: Rival Geralt and Yennefer Von Vengerberg 3. Call of Duty: Cpt John Price and Soap MacTavish and Simon ''Ghost'' Riley 4. Zelda: Link 5. The Last of Us: Joel Miller and Ellie Williams and Marlene and Tess 6. Uncharted: Nathan Drake and Sam Drake and Elena Fisher and Chloe Frazer 7. Left 4 Dead 1: Bill and Zoey and Francis and Louis 8. Left 4 Dead 2: Nick and Rochelle and Coach and Ellis 9. Batman Arkham City: Bruce Wayne (as Batman) and Joker and Harley Quinn and Ridler and Penguin and Catwoman and Two Face and Killbane 10. Assassins Creed: Ezio de Auditore and Connor and Evie, Jacob Frye Brothers and Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and Edward Kenway  If these game characters are added to the series, I'm sure it will be great.
This is amazing. A nice selection of games that we grew up with and to see them on the screen is awesome. Really enjoyed it.
It's pretty shit
lol Concord is dead before this release
The first 8 episodes of Secret Level are available on Prime Video in the US, Canada, UK, AU and globally (240 countries/territories). New episodes will air on Tuesday.
hm ill give this one a pass, visuals seem nice but it feels kind of empty.
agan uno de reimbou six
so once this is out do we finally get the next season of love death and robots? or do we now have to wait for 2026-2027
Please hope we will see Astro bot
what is the song used
Tomorrow...
KRATOS AND CALL OD DUTY
I see my goat sifu
FOR THE EMPEROOOOOOOORRRRR!!!!!!!!
as a amateur player for 15 years, this trailer really gives me chill.
The thumbnail looks stellarisy.
armored core !Rockman ! warhammer 40k !
Too bad it doesn't include Halo, DONE RIGHT!
Hoping for 2K to be a mature adult and shares his Mafia for a future episode
ARMORED CORRREEEE!!
Wouldve rather seen Overwatch than Concord ngl😂
YESSSS PAC MAN LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO  FINALLY NAMCO IS GIVING THAT TESTICLE WITH JAUNDICE THE LOVE HE DESERVES
It’s like “ready player one”.
I can’t wait for the megaman and pac man episodes
A series of pilot episodes
NO WAYYYYYYYY !!! 😍
Garbage
Track pls🙏
Instead of wasting money on this should have made a warhammer series or armoured core or bloodborne limited series
Jin sakai
Megaman and Pac-man :0
Me recordó mucho a ready player one . Aunque se trate de otra cosa la trama
Pls no concord shi
No Ubisoft , rockstar and valve 🥲🥲 and wtf concord doin there
They had such high hopes for “Concord” didn’t they?
So now we have Another multi-style anthology. Joining all of:  The Animatrix Love, Death and Robots StarWars Visions The Boys Presents Diabolical  And that other anthology Disney made I can’t remember the name of.
Concord 😂
How THE HECK did I not know about this series??
A sony nem deu um dinheiro, hein.
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA
I only want to watch the Concord episode. If it does come out as part of the series, it will be their most popular one 😅😅
Concord is most likely to get pulled out and replaced by something else from PlayStation and they probably ain’t gonna say anything about it until it drops
Stay lorefriendly and keep your quotas and DEI-Goals out of it and we will be happy with the quality of movies and cinematic magic we all know you can deliver. If you want DEI in movies, make new ones where the characters actually fit in and it has a great stroytelling, both narrative and by design. Not endless talks about psychological Problems or political topics that never even existed in these worlds, only because our real world has problems. We want to be entertained by things we love, not educated like little kids in the disguse of entertainment.
a series who mix episodes with animation and live action actors episodes something never see before
The irony here is that video game fans routinely skip cutscenes in games and sometimes miss out on some absolutely brilliant gems (of cutscenes) now Prime are asking those same usually impatient cutscene-skipping fans to sit down and watch a whole series of Cutscenes. Those videogame viewers will  literally be twitching for the 'skip' button.
MEGA MAN! ARMORED CORE too sick
Unreal Tournament! **fanboy noises**
elden ring
Concord? Wait...CONCORD?! WHY?!
Everybody! Let's skip the Concord episode! 🌚
Absolutley here for warhammer 40k!
Imagine making an entire episode about a game, Concord, that has been removed from the stores after 2 weeks from its launch, because no one bought it and no one was playing it, and the studio that made the game has been completely shut down by Sony cause it flopped so hard that it was the biggest fail in the entire history of videogames, LMAO.
Concord 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I woud like to watch this movie.
You have a truly interesting lineup. Not gonna lie, I like the fact you did armored core and outer worlds both less known than their more popular counterparts (dark souls and skyrim respectively). But its interesting how will you spin Concord
I hope 40k episode will get a lot of views and Amazon will realize a potential to this IP and give us a full fledge 40k series.
40k and Unreal Tournament are more than I could have asked for... I'm so hyped for these episodes!
0:56 earworm problem
WHY IS THERE NOBODY MENTIONING SPELUNKY SJSJIDNRIFJFJFF
I wonder if they will do better than Astartes for Warhammer, one man VS a complete VFX Studio
This would be the perfect series to show disney how to do KOTOR .
hope they continue to use games, i need a time crisis piece
NOW WE'RE TALKIN'-
No Bloodborne? :(
When that astartes tackled that car, i became sold.
I’ll take any armored core content i can get
FOR THE EMPEROR!
I'm curious what the Playstation one will be. Kratos standing in the middle of Dumbo, Brooklyn is giving me Ready Player One vibes.
This is awesome, though I really was hoping for titanfall 2 to possibly appear, especially with 3 months of people hating on the appearance of concord.
starcraft, half life, titanfal????????????
Plis gears and starcraft
acabé.
ARMORED CORE LETS GOOOOO TS ABOUTTA BE SO LIT
Armored Core! Let's go boys!
VAMOOOO KARALHO!
SIFU <3
Concord's episode will last longer than Concord itself did.
👏😭
Lord valdemord
Add Cyberpunk2077 to the 2. season and my life is yours
I’m just here for the Space Marines
WTF 🤯
So.....I'm sure all that concord investment will pay off.....lmao
I’m only here for warhammer
🤩<3
Pause it at 1:27. Then you'll remember that Pac-Man is a bad guy. Cause that evil looking mouth with jaws is scary as hell.
Wreck it Ralph copycat
Wie heißt das Lied?
0:49 why is kratos in a modern environment? kinda looks like buildings in the background
Just don’t forget that your duty as a human in this universe is that reality needs to be the better for it, not just your perception of it.
I hope the concord episode is the first episode. Get it out of the way.
Epic fail. No World of Warcraft, No Fortnite, No Minecraft, No Skyrim? But it has New World and...😂 Concord?! Fail!!!
Why is kratos in new York? 🤔 0:49
Hope we get horizon... Aloy deserves a spot
How about WoW????
1:02 i cant tell if this is helldivers or not yellow hud, skull icons (3 skulls representing your 3 other teamates), and the visor is the same shape as a helldiver's helmet this could be a whole other game idk
There's a Concord episode but not a Halo, Gears, Battlefield, Devil May, or Resident Evil episodes
Concord. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's actually awesome. Although I don't have time to play this great game, but maybe I would see the series.
I'm most excited to see the Exodus one. But I'm in for the whole series. Heard such good things about Love Death + Robots, but still haven't watched it myself. The quality of this trailer is enough to make me excited, though!
ARMORED CORE!
Holy shit. this gave me goosbumps.
Gonna watch this for the Mega Man episode. Hyped.
Can't wait for UNREAL TOURNAMENT!!
Moooooooooneyyyy graaaaaab!
LOOKING INTO THE VOID IM SCARY
If it gets a new season, please include an episode in the Dishonored universe.
Who do you think will voice Megaman
Too broad man. Just make a less super action sales based megaman niche movie with good story telling and you're set
Where is it
wait...wtf is this ?! i'm confused ...  :S
As exciting as it sounds, I'm also curious how they get around copyright issues. so much to look forward to for Christmas.
"Featuring Concord" ... too soon, man, too soon...
Sooooo do they have time to create a replacement for the concord episode? 😂
Those first 10 seconds tho.
Too bad I skip all the cutscenes.
Foda demais 😊❤
A space marine shoulder checking a car? Im in
Concord, hahahahaha
like here after it gets released, i dont want to miss this
A new adventure, just for you, with exxxxtraa DEI!
Gamers Rise
Prime is the new netflix because they failed to change their ways and always cancelled after 1 season. Prime is the future
What I would give to see a Halo Reach or Flood themed episode.
FOR THE EMPEROR !!!
Holy.....😍🤯😳😳😳
can i 👉👈 give you... a kiss? 🥺
BRUHTHERS WE ARE SPESS MAHREENSS
Concord 😅
Kratos looks strange... he's in a relatively modern city with buildings and cars
so is no one going to ask why PAC MAN is in this series.
VERY YES. 😯
Even despite its failure...why on Earth would you put a brand new IP like Concord in when there's tons of great IPs with built in fanbases you could have used?
Concord
I’m most likely only gonna watch for megaman and sifu
pocas cosas que saca prime que me urge ver poco pero vale la pena
Warhammer 40000 nice
Good thing they put in Concord, it's so popular right now! 😂😂
Cool, but i wanted mario and sonic to have own episode in this series
Kratos 0:49 😲
Ohhhh MYYYYYYY GODDDDDDDDDDD..... Literally GooseBUMPSS..
Falta Destiny, residen evil, the last of us.
So does this mean no Love Death and Robots Volume 4?
For a season 2, imagine if you will:  -a Death Stranding episode directed by Hideo Kojima  OR  -an Alan Wake or Control episode directed by Sam Lake
SIFU 🤩
when te concordeas
Guys Helldivers are in it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
kinda think they should REMOVE Concord because the game DOES NOT EXIST anymore   like come on you can't think "hey we made some cringe game" no one bought it
PLEASE DONT BE WEEKLY UPLOADS! we gamers like to binge, lets us watch it all!
WHERE CONCORD
Knew they had Concord but didn’t know about The Outer Worlds definitely will watch that episode
too much smoothed and mid sampled mocap and forced camera shake.
Waiting for it eagerly
Concord over Destiny is crazy
Wow , Can’t Wait 😃😃😃
Not Concord💀
I can't believe that they chose to put Concord instead of Helldivers is just crazy
Me myself a Halo Fan crying in the corner
Really excited for all of these but especially Warhammer. Fingers crossed that it's good.
Helldivers! Let’s go!  My baby up there.  One of the youngest games out of the bunch and man did it shoot to the top in such short time.   It deserves to be up there.   Concord however…
I'm hard
Music please🙏🙏🙏
Concord 🫡
wow it will be very cool series
Did i see Crossfire In it 😀?
I'm hoping each episode is hour long
LMAO now that the studio is officially dead and with it any hope of Concord coming back, I wonder what are they gonna do with that episode.
Titanfall 2 would be hype
Titus charging and plowing through a techie full of baseliners goes fucking hard.
Imagine the episode is so good fans demand concord get rebooted 😂
Bout to remove concord off the show
I disagree with people saying to remove the concord episode. This series is to celebrate iconic games, what is more iconic than the largest fail in history of video games?
replace concord with astro bot
Can't wait to see my favorite game Concord 😍
I'm here for Megaman
Tbh they should just not release or cutout the concord parts
Lots of great games, I'd love to see a season two with games like Titanfall 2 and Team Fortress 2
Who else is looking forward to the Concord episode?
Wow...now that Sony has closed Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios and Concord is totally dead, wonder if they'll leave that game in the series....
Megaman 💖 cyberpunk ☺️☺️☺️
I know keanu is in armored core but i swear it showed night city too!
ARMORED CORE LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
"15 stories inspired by your favorite games" 1min15 "concord", i laugh so hard.
VERY AWESOME!!! 😝❤️‍🔥
0:55 garden of banban?
Year 40k
PLEASE have a RDR2 episode 😭😭
MA BOY TITUS IS HERE LETS GOOOO. edit: I've been rewining the beginning and seems like this story is after SM2, if y'all notice in the beginning, he has his Imperial Laurel he received at the end of the game, so maybe we're gonna watch the mission Kalgar gave him at the end of the game!!!! I CANT WAIT.
this is heresy if we have female custodies
Where we dropping boys 🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If they ever do another one of these I need to see half-life or titanfall (or one just for indie games)
Dragon ball z budokai or sparking zero, realist please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Give concords episode to halo
The Emperor protects!
"Rise... son of Guilliman..."
Hell yeah! Bring on the show. UT99!
Kinda sad assassins creed and halo isnt there
"from your favorite games" and "concord" can't really mix.. all jokes aside, oh yeah, this looks good.
The Concord episode should be removed. No one cares about that game. No one played it. That's why they took it down after just 12 days.
yes, pac man as a langolier is all i need
Ac AND ut. Wow. And from the love death robots holy moly
That Space Marine/Amazon Prime intro just reaks of the guy who created the Astartes shorts. Even in Death he still serves
There's Concord, but there is no: -Halo -World of Warcraft -Mass Effect -Assassin's Creed  Let that shit sink in.
I know like three of the things here. Space marines, Kratos, I know there’s a helldivers episode coming, Pac-Man, and there’s a dnd one? Huh?
me waiting for the concord episode
Im hyped, dude warhammer 40k omfg, ultra marines on prime thats insane Bro ;)
40k from the love death+robots guys^^^^^^.   Only problem is GW is a grimdark company.
OMG WARHAMMER 40K
WHERE MINECRAFT
“Amazon or you normally this incompetent or do you have to try!!! Don’t answer that you’re fired!!!”  Said by a mean ol Michigan, I hope to see him in it
Just coming back here to say that I'm waiting it more than christmas
Concord ahahahahahahahahahaha
U better stick to the Warhammer lore
!For the emperor!
Halo?
esta serie aun no se estrena y ya siento que merece otra temporada, estoy especialmente emocionado por ver el capítulo de God Of War, y sería hermoso ver que en una hipotética segunda temporada, hagan capítulos de Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, Tomb Rider, Recident Evil, Red Dead Redemption, Prince of Persia, Street Fighter, Yakuza, etc...
Cyberpunk should of been apart of this. ❤
0:56 Concord
Where is dark souls bloodborne or elden ring?
Just realized thats Titus
Like if you thought the thumbnail was Darth Plagues 😜
delete the concord episode and i’ll watch
Look how they massacred my Concord 😭
D&D, Pac Man, Mega Man, Warhammer and God of War are, fine but there are some ridiculous choices here since they are absolutely not among the most beloved games, but the second season should be much better.
Probably late but they confirmed that the warhammer one will be a direct sequel to SM2
Mega Man. The boss villains have so much potential
Who let Concord in here 😭
Anybody else skipping the concord episode?
For anyone who likes warhammer, this will probably have Titus from space marine 2. The armour is exactly the same as the one from the game, it probably takes place after the game is set
If there not releasing all episodes at once, I guess I’m not watching it till all are out.
Remember folks, Concord cost 400$ Million Dollars.
Ready player One vibes
This must be the continuation of the space marine 2 campaign after the end when titus leaves
Most excited for warhammer god of war  then sifu
how much drums do you want?  all
why tf every trailer need to have like way over too much drums
can there be more drums!?
Concord is gonna be awkward
Hahah bull shiit. No world of Warcraft????
Why is Co cord here and not Helldivers 2?
Mega Man!!!!! 🤖🔥
I thought i saw BT for a second there🤔
Concord 😂
Ready or Not mentioned 🗣🔥
half life 3 as an episode...
Only Warhammer among these games is hot and deserves respect. All other games on this list are trash.
Its gonna be good, but there are a few game suggestions there that puzzle me, what is honor of kings? I have never heard of that, and Concord being here is just sad. Surely they should have dropped that episode since the game was canned. Even if the episode is great, it just goes to show what a competent team can do with any license.  New world is also a puzzle, because as far as I know its not a very popular mmo. However its an amazon game so makes sense. Warhammer, Armoured Core, Sifu, and Exodus are the highlights for me. UnrealTournament? Since when do people still play this? lol.
Who is her to laugh at Concord?
We Need Mortal Kombat Soon In This One, If They Can Recreate The Art Style Of Sifu, Then Man, I Can't Imagine What They Could Do With Mortal Kombat
Yo. YES. MORE OF THIS in the industry. PLEASE.   Video games are an untapped gold mine for content. LET'S GO. Let's make this the norm.   Also, I came here because I heard they're doing a Helldivers episode and I'm going to cream if that's true.   Words cannot describe how excited I am to see more Helldivers content like that intro cutscene. It's SO well done.  I am bummed we haven't heard anything from Halo in this series, though... gotta do SOMETHING with the Chief, no?
I know it didn’t show it here, but in the show poster, you can see a helldiver. So I’m really hoping we get one of those episodes.
I went to their panel at NYCC and looks great! Especially Warhammer clip and the PAC-MAN clip was surprising!
Warhammer 40000? Space marines? I'm in.
Hahaha who invited Concord?
This looks amazing
Secret level  ✖ Love death& robots sn3 ✔
Im mainly just excited for the 40k one, it looked nice, Sifu too
Concord ?😂😂😂😂
Thank god it's not games like FNAF or Roblox. This looks awesome, I saw helldivers on a poster in the back, thought it was monster hunter too but d&d is sick too.
The F concord do here?
This is your new mission go now and play the game
WE NEED A THE WITCHER EPISODE
IS THAT A HELLDIVER AT 1:02
I would really like to see stuff like Mass Effect, Halo or BattleTech / Mechwarrior. But I guess there wasn't enough money left after Warhammer hahaha Maybe in S2
I heard that DEMOCRACY is in this series?
The fact that concord is in this series but not doom is sad.
We're getting an F ing concord episode but not a Halo one.   WTF
concord's section is a casket going down to its final destination
I NEED to see this just because of Spelunky
Why no overwatch oh man
PAC MAN PAC MAN PAC MAN PAC MAN-
will we ever get to see starcraft?
Kratos🤝🏻
the Concord episode will be a Lost Media
bro, not concord
Remove concord, put helldivers
Im one of the 4 people excited for spelunky
No bloodborne no good
At 0:41 was that supposed to be lee from the walking dead ?
Can't wait to see John helldiver :D
15 stories inspired by your favorite games... and Concord (because Sony paid us to include it)
Tired of Prime.. We cannot see all good horror films in Denmark. have searched paranormal activity, Silent Hill and many others. But get the same message every time...."""This video is currently unavailable in your location """ Why the hell can't we see the good "old" horror movies here in Denmark?
Uuuhh. Unreal Tournament... Ou yeahhhh
concord? more like conconoidon'thinkso haha
The secret level is unlocked by my farts
i just want a god of war and warhammer show
Mani essa seria vai ser foda dimais
Kevin Hart ruined it
How many minutes will each episode be will they be hours long or like love death robot short 15 min story
Fucking yes
サムネがアコライトのダースプレイガスかと思った
The only thing that's missing is 2D animation in this teaser. 😎
Sifu In The Games 2D CG Stylized Animation Is Gonna Be Amazing But Whos Gonna Voice Unless Its Voice Actor Nicholas Goh?
The Voice Cast Is Insane
Warhammer 30k alone is enough for me and you have half-life too? wow
Первому игроку приготовиться
Lmao concord is still on there
The best part it comes out on my birthday
This will be amazing, what an opportunity!! Hope to see NieR Automata / Replicant one day. That world has a lot to explore and explote!
I really can’t wait for Concords episode
WOW WOW WOW
what game is the first shot?
Was not expecting spelunky AT ALL
Ready Player One Vibes
why is concord mixed up with so many good games?
I have a question… what does that mean for concord now? Lmao
"Your favorite games". *concord* Uh huh. So beloved it got shut down in less than a month.
come on, you have concord to play
Secret Level: “Hey, remember Concord?”
Who ever came here for the millionth time please like 😂
Prime is going to realize that giving us media that the fans want is going to pay tenfold. Thank you.
I see concord. I won't watch xd
Take the concord episode out and many more will watch.
spelunky fans rise up
I Can't wait🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope someone makes a series out of the Noobtown books by Ryan Rimmel.
it's from a team I appreciate and it looks as stunning as I expect from them, I trust the writing will not fall behind
I want to see episodes of SCP, METRO, L4D2, They Are Billions, Dead by daylight, Darkest Dungeon.... and Among Us
"Your favorite games" Concord ............................................................
We better not see a female space marine
wait... DECEMBER? I THOUGHT IT WAS RELEASING IN OCTOBER
I'm calling it. When the Concord episodes drop and people fall in love with the characters and world in the show, they are going to want the game back.
Prime, no shipping promises kept! Added boat load of commercials! Raised rate of prime. Moving on from Prime Smart!
I'm interested in the 40K stuff.
can't wait to long
From the visionaries of love death + robots… as long as they’re referring to the first season of love death + robots and not the disappointments that were the last two seasons, this might be alright.
They dropping all the episodes same day or weekly.
1:15  >concord  AHAHAHAHAHAH
Jangan cari yg gk ada, disini yg masuk game yg bener bener populer di dunia, bukan populer se ASEAN doang (MLGBT)😹
How is this incredible trailer not uploaded in 4K HDR?
"Your favorite games."  Concord: Slowly raises it's hand.
Am I the only one who noticed that marine is Titus?
It's funny how like three of these games were complete, utter, ridiculous flops that wrote history as being the worst flops of all humankind and killed one or the other company in the process. Guess we now finally know where the marketing money went.  Still hyped as F*CK for this show!!!
Chance concord for helldivers 2
pls do warhammer 40k
Seeing a dude drop into an AC makes me weep. We gamers, deserved this. There's going to be tears through the entire series. How does it feel to get a fucking win folks?!
Just here for Warhammer 40k. When's the live action??
Animation is getting insane. Actually got chills when the game titles flashed. Such a rad concept, I love it.
Why no Overwatch?
Concord thinks they're on the team.
Really sad to not see any assassin's Creed
Unreal Tournament?  Warhammer??  D&D!?  MEGA MAN!?!?  concord.  FRIGGIN' PAC MAN!!!!!!!????????
Not the reboot of captain N I was expecting but...color me interested.
Spelunky HYYYYPE
Yes 🫡
Tremendo Trailer°!!!! epico...Crossfire!!! La musica que suena alguien sabe cual es?
I would say i really hope they make a Mass Effect movie.. But they will make it femshep so I hope they don't touch it. Im cool with people playing femshep. I didn't so to me it would be like making Reven from KOTOR a woman even though you could in the game. I don't hate games with women protagonists the New Tomb Raider Shadow and Rise were amazing. The last of US amazing. LIfe is Strange still in my top 10.
concord 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
nintendo hire this man the show
Looking forward for sifu episode🔥!(~better not end with shitty spare choice/narrative🙄), but let's see on the big day
Sifu 🔥🔥
If there's a season 2 (I really hope so) it should have some more heavy weights like Halo, Gears of War, Dead Space, Ratchet & Clank, Crysis, Army of Two, Battlefield, Cyberpunk 2077 and more     Hell, I just want to see EVERY FREAKING GAME we love
first of all : looks good  second : the Concord Part cannot have aged well
Is that Demetrian Titus himself? I noticed the right pauldron design and the laurels on his helmet (which would mean this happens after the game). Could this episode be a tie-in to new content for the game coming this December?
I Concordate
0:08 Warhammer pulling Concord's coffin
YESSIR God Of War!!!  please please please be at least an hour long, please!!
Yooooo LD+R is making this!!!!🗣🗣🗣
That space marine they kept showing is definitely Titus
For the emperor!!!
Please upload it in 4k
lol concord was on here wow are they going to keep it or retcon it lol omg lit asf amazon
Ima keep it real this should be how video game movies are made non of that live action crap that leads to a lot of compromises just make it in the style it was made in
Wait Warhammer 40k in Prime. Now you have me intressted.
Concord!!! 🎉
Love death and robot ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I dare you to make a Totalwar Warhammer ep, i double dare you, pls 🥹
We need a season two before the show even comes out. And make it have helldivers.
whats this? 0:45
Capcom dont stop cooking for us mega man fans
Omg this is gonna be special I'm invested love death and robots say less
Honestly let them cook  man im looking forward
Your favorites GAMES, Concord...
This show will most definitely be great but the fact Concord is in it is funny.
game is prime video
i like prime video x warhammer 40k speak usa💀💀💀💀
"December 10" we will be there no matter what
these will be insanely sucessfull
Concord
Did i see concord in there? Hahah
Another Isekai'd chosen one plain joe? Alright then. At least Megaman is in it. I like the redesign so far.
all thanks to the Emperor of Man
I will waiting for concord episode 😂
warhammer prime video to prime video not uk speak call speak usa🥶
"Your favorite games". Shows concord. I really have no clue how concord is a favorite game. How much did sony pay amazon to do this??????
Ha ha I'll be there for the Concord cringe
As a great villain once said-  “Wow! This is garbage. You actually like this?”
The concord one will be hella awkward
holy shitttttt 😍
Qué locura :)
Imagine the meme with the sweaty dude an two red buttons "delete Concord episode" and "release Concord episode" 😂
CONCORD 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Really wanting to know what happen to Concord episode, even the drama of Concord outlive the game itself, many youtuber will have a lot of new content if the Concord episode still there
So what's going to happen to the Concord episode, is it still going to release or is it going to be pulled?
This gives me ready player one vibes
blur studios should next partner up with disney plus for more grittier disney short films
The fact that there’s Concord and not Halo just hurts
Ready Player One vibes
15 stories from your favourite games.        Concord 😂
¿Concord? jajajajajajajajajajajajaj, skip this crap episode.
Music please 🙏?
Does anyone know who did the music from the trailer and what it is called?
I just realized what could be the plot in the Warhammer episode, it connects to the ending of Space Marine II so if you haven't played that yet you better go and do it, It's amazing!  SPOILER ALERT:  So in the end Titus gets a new mission from Lord Calgar recommended by the Chaplain who turns out to be Leandros from Space Marine 1 so i guess this is like a sequel to what we see in Space Marine II. The main character is Titus there's no doubt about it, first we see the "ULTRA" with a skull on his shoulder pad and then if you pay attention we can see the crest in his helmet that he gets at the end by Lord Calgar.  I'M SO HYPED
What is that? Looks amazing. I've never heard about this.
holy shit
1:15 the joke tells itself
It's like including a celebrity in your work weeks before they get into a controversy.
Dewey (Concord), get out of there! That's not your family!.jpg
I saw Tiamat and that's all i needed to sell me on this.
No warframe, no halo, no doom, no mario, no zelda, no world of warcraft, no persona, no pokemon, no gran turismo, no need for speed, no tlou, no banjo kazoie, no crash, no gears of war, no diablo, no titanfall, no apex, no COD, no silent hill... But fk yea we have concord
The biggest sony's gohgohgoh ive seen by so far
Kratooooos kratooooooos
so no love death and robots season 4 ... well thats bad/ , but hey i will pay prime  to see this , smart move jeff smart move , i know jeff bezos and just like me i bet he loves   "love death and robots" ... my boy jeff keep it in real ...
concord?
Concord? Really? Looks like it's not a series for gamers, but platform to invest money in advertising.
We are eating good.
I swear I saw BT in there
I wonder if they're gonna release the Concord short...
Here's an idea and I mean this in a nice way. Push this back for another year, remove Concord and replace it with something we actually love like Doom or Subnautica. Hell you've got PlayStation on board, why not adapt Stellar Blade or Bloodborne?
That Concord episode is gonna be the most skipped episode or the most laughable one Amazon has ever done in a series.
1:27 blud what they do to my boy pac-man💀😭
Amorerd core god of war wharhammer 40k =happy life
Of all the game franchises they could have made an episode about they chose to do Concord. A game no one has played before and then when it came out still no one played it. Stick to established franchises Amazon you idiot.
My eyes are playing tricks, I thought I saw Concord for a sec, lol.
Replace Concord with Warframe
15 stories inspired by your favorite games lol and concord is one , no one had even played it or heard of it yet cmon now
MDS ESTOU MT HYPADO
I would’ve loved to have seen doom in there but still this should be amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Yessss!
Major Astartes vibes for the warhammer shots
This looks to be glorious.
Armored Core and Crossfire are the GOAT!! THE GOAT!!!
Concord being in this is the biggest sneak of the century. like who let their lil brother in type vibe
Did i just saw the armored core?!
Wow😀😀😀😀
Idk what everyone else is saying. Concord was the greatest game of all time. Those characters were legendary. Can't wait to get an episode that doesn't identify as an episode.
i hope we either get a battlefield 1 watchdogs or jedi game episode
0:59 HELLLLOOOOOO TITUS!!
1:15
Siii
0:50  Що? Кратос опиниться у майбутньому?
Was that a Bloodborne hunter at 1:17 ?
AMAZING!!!!!!!!
Does anyone else know what this is from? 0:47 maybe warhammer fantasy?
I wonder if they're actually gonna release that Concord episode lmao
I swear to God if there's a Warhammer movie or series and they try to make it "culturally appropriate" I'm not even gonna bother watching it. Given how badass the games were, it deserves to have an amazingly lore accurate show/movie
CONCORD WAS A WASTE OF SLOT!!!!
It would be really funny if the Concord episode turns out to be this incredible piece of storytelling with immense emotional depth that makes people reappreciate the game.  The developers worked throughout over 6 years in the game, it had to be crushing to feel the reception it got; they deserve the possible reappraisal this show could give to it.
MEGA MAN LESS GO
Let us all just appreciate the fact that video game-related shows start to appear - it's a good sign that the new era has finally come. Maybe we will get a Bloodborne or a Dark Souls/Demon Souls show someday - games with a deep lore and stories deserve to have a continuation in real life <3
I hope its better than the over dramatic trailer music.
Concord, omegalol
Replace concord with Killzone!!!!!!!!
I hope you dropped the Concord episode!
This is a win for gamers!!! Gamers unite!!!
The Astartes guy - i can smell his soul in this one!!
Where is terraria
we dont want this.................................................we need this.
Concord?  Never even heard of it 🤣 Edit : How Much Firewalk Studios Paid for this
Warhammer 40k???????????????
Young Mary Walker Jennifer Johnson Helen
If the Warhammer short does not reach the bar set by "Astartes", ima rage out.
if it has the text "love death and robots", i am in
Concord 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Concord episode has its own pronouns (gone/cancelled)
HACED UN EPISODIO CON LEGACY OF KAIN, POR FAVOR, POR FAVOR, POR FAVOR
Let's hope it doesn't turn into a thing that is only made for profit
concord bruh...
wow this looks sick
We need a helldivers and the finals episode man
1:16 es hora de concordear
ARE THEY GONNA CUT THE CONCORD EPISODE??? LMAOOO
concord LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Blur Studios ! does anyone remember Rockfish? that animated short blew my mind back in the day. and Unreal Tournament is on the list !!!
TÁ MALUCOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Dam excited 😍😍
Concord? This peace of sick shit???
30% of the people know that the thumbail of the video is from the pacman episode
lol concord
This looks incredible
Vai ter concord kkk
are you going to bring the Concorde to 600 people?
Please more of this❤❤❤
Bro is that Titus after the campaign
When the animation quality looks better in this , than that 3 billion piece of crap that’s airing at the moment
doideira em hypado
The concord cameo episode for this series didn’t age well, and the game didn’t even make it to a month old before being scrapped. Lol
My only question is why tf is kratos in a modern city
my ghost is so tsushima rn
I’m wondering if concord will still have a spot?
It would be funny if the concord episode ends being better than what happened on the game  (well, it's not like we had a lot, only two or three cutscenes and nothing else)
Feel like a Cyberpunk ep would have had way more of an impact than Concord, even before it was messed up.
I’m so excited. I hope they hire Alberto mielgo for a GTA or Cyberpunk themed level. His animations on love death and robots were amazing.
Movie name
That Concord game looks pretty cool, I wonder where can I buy it
Ready player 2
PRIMMMMME REPLACE CONCORD EPISODE WITH DOOM, AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
This has got me so hyped. LDR is my favorite series, and to have a game-related anthology coming from its creators makes me stoked af!
Can we put a megamix of the overwatch cinematics in place of the Concord one?
was that a concord character? gtfo hahaha remove that shit.
Concord gets an episode, and not a single one for Bloodborne or Dark Souls. I'm excited for Armored Core, but nothing for Elden Ring, the 2022 Game of the Year?
Our favorite? Where's killzone(Helghast side), resistance, army of two. Ya know, the classics that we would love to see an animated series of... I can go on and on. Shinobi, Kane and Lynch, ManHunt.. the list goes on and on.
Song
Omg
goosebumps this is gonna be great
Geez these people had concord comic books aperal movies and tons of merchandise that some south Eastern Asian person will be wearing at some expensive clothes store oblivious of the irony of it!
Goyslop/Concord.
Geek culture is consumerist trash.
Афигеть! Качество арта просто нечто! Скорей бы дождаться «экранку с теми самыми голосами»
For a wooping Bitrate of 20 mbps, even youtube offers 4K at 44–56 Mbps, I'll wait for the 4k blu-ray disc if they ever release it...
So is this where Project Astartes went?
UNREAL TOURNAMENT ????????   I AM ABOUTTA CRY , YES YES YES YES YES YES PLS YES YES YES YES
This feels like "Tales from Ready Player One" or "Matrix What If.....?" I'm in.
Sad some games got choosen due to paycheck. Why Outer worlds ? Why concord ? Awkward
"Based on your favourite games... Concord". I can't even bring myself to mock that. Just makes me feel bad for the folks who worked on it.
ДААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА!
HAHAHAHHA CONCORD IS IN HERE?!?!?!?
Oh hell yeah
The fact that it isn't a normal space but fucking demetrian titus itself (Protagonist of space marine 1 and space marine 2) makes it more interesting
Kratos in - what it seems like New York - is crazy
Hopefully this time, Concorde is actually decent
petition to remove concord from this also and add a franchise worthy of this
Peak
Honestly, the only thing that I recognized was War Hammer 40K.
Oh hell yeah. I’m in
MEGA FUCKING MAN IS BACK
Oh and put metroid ,killer instinct 2013 and 3d battletoads and street fighter 6, final fantasy vi and samurai shodown warriors rage for the old generation please.
Look it's just a friendly advice but why don't you put games like gungrave, strider in 3d, anarchy reigns, bayonetta, madworld and god hand in this series just for us who loved these games.
Unreal Tournament getting some love after so many years... Hopefully
this teaser made my tip creamy
Then Minecraft Steve shows up.
I just realized after playing Space Marine 2. The 40K animation will follow Titus as that's the blue boy we see center stage.
im in
Hahahahahahaha whoever considered concerned a favorite game of consumers is very checked out from reality.
Not in a million years would I have predicted Spelunky. Holy fucking shit.
This should be an absolute prove that games can be adapted to movie and it can be good
Glad someone at Prime recognized what we want. Love Death Robots? You have my undivided attention!
I'm shook.
Fellas this is our opportunity to get a official tf2 episode
some questionable choices are in there for sure, but i'm still very hyped and doubt any of the episodes will be far from amazing
Finally, giving your audience what we want. Was that so hard prime? was it??
Gano el cine señores
replace concord with astrobot
"Hmm, guys , do u remember the episode we made with Concord ? Yeah ? Well u can forget about it !"
1:13 UNREAL TOURNAMENT! Woooooooooooooo im hype
Warhammer 40k!!
ARE THOSE FUCKING ULTRA MARINES
hopefully we'll get an animated 40k series in the future if this does well.
They should delete the Concord episode and make a Wukong Black Myth episode
Hear me out but how cool it would be to see one these but for like an episode with  Spider-Man ps4 Mortal kombat  Minecraft  Halo Fnaf Street fighter
SONG AT THE END???
i know this was before concord died but like what made you think that was anyone's favorite game?
i know this was before concord died but like what made you think that was anyone's favorite game?
wait is there a D&d video game or am I just trippin'?
Some of the most beloved video games... so, who do you think has played all this games? More of them are not even known for 90% of gamers.  It would be better to say something like "the games we were able to get the license", it's more accurate.
Are they trying to sus out which game needs it own TV series based on viewership of this shit?...
I want to be excited, but I can't help but cringe. Too many terrible video game adaptations.
Ld+r guys im innnnnn
This give me love, death, robot video game version vibes
I raced here to watch anything 40k related in this kind of quality. But seeing Unreal Tournament mentioned is what brought a tear to my eye.
I'm not gonna do the 10 millionth post about Concord because I don't know what it is and don't really care. This looks like  BIG step down from Love and Robots. We'll see.
Only gonna watch the 40k and Armored Core episodes
😍👏🏻😍👏🏻
Space marines count me in
Wait is that titus from space marine??
Concord?   We'll see.
I dont know guys, i think this show might suck
Im more than happy with the following animation that we‘re blessed to see. But a Red Dead Episode would have made me cry out like a 17 year old girl on a Justin Biber Concert in 2010.
"Concord" That one aged like fine milk
WE ARE FINALLY GETTING SCREEN TIME BROTHERS!!! THE EMEROR PROTECTS!
THIS IS SO PEAK
SOOO LOVE DEATH ND ROBOTS DONE?? 💔💔💔💔
i have a feeling this will be about people uploading consciousness into virtual realities
Concord sharing the same screen as Warhammer is plain disrespectful.
Watta fucking trash is this I waiting this now
Hoping they remove Concord episode. There's way more better games that deserve to be on this.
Despite the hilarious Concord gaff I'll say I'm excited for this. It's risky territory but doing an anthology series is smart. Maybe we'll go with "cautiously optimistic"
🔥🔥🔥
И из-за этого мы теряем прохождение ради анимации.
Kratos!!!!!!!
Jin sakai flashed there just for half a second... I'm already excited for this 🎉🎉
MEGAMAN!!!!!!
Unreal Tournament? In 2024? Pigs must be flying!
PLEASSSEEE DON'T MESS THIS UPPPPPPP PLEEEEAAAASSEEEEEEEEE
Having Concord is wild
“15 stories inspired by your favorite games”  Concord is one of our favorite games? It being a part of this is definitive proof against this statement.  It should read “15 stories of our upcoming IPs we wanna push, as well as any other publisher who was willing to pay us $$$ to place their long-form ad as an episode onto our playlist”  The forced hype is getting pretty old.
FINALLY BROTHERS!!!!! A space marine show well an episode... FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!
this looked really good i cant wait to see it
Now that is a proper trailer cut
Didn't see Balatro :(
The Warhammer one will be great I hope.   Also give Henry Cavil complete creative Control Cover the Warhammer Cinematic Universe or it will propably die before it even started
Replace Concord with Elden Ring, much better or Black Myth Wukong
The visuals are stunning. I hope the story will be presented well.
It's looks like ready player on part 2
Warhammer animation and movement had to have come from the Astartes Project. Hope they hired the creator and didn’t take his style.
Armored core !?
0:12 0:52 1:24
why is no one talking about spelunky being mentioned in the description 😭😭😭
0:49 WTF Kratos...
concord xd
Having concord in this is a joke, also having Amazon fail of game.
Hope they scrap the Concord episode.
oh hell yeahhh
Everyone: Bloodborne Remaster, Remake, Rerelease, or even just a 60fps patch? Sony: Concord it is.
*MY CORE IS MORE ARMORED THAN EVER BEFORE*
I'm in tears right now, my dear mega man...
"15 epic stories, celebrated video games" why is there concord in there? hahaha
Finally ill get to see what this concord is all about
Concord? Holy LLLLLL
0:47 Holy crap! That’s Mega Man I think! If they’re going to cover all kinds of games, they also need to also do Metroid, Kid Icarus, Punch Out, Arms, The Legend of Zelda, and Star Fox.
I hope concord episode will remove with another game, it literally closed rn and has no right to have an episode which can be made about another really good game
Cool, but sad that none of them will be fully 2D animated.
I need more anthology format sci-fi in my life.
I really hope the Warhammer one is worked on by the Astarte guy
So, no fromsoftware ?
Adding Concord to this was solely a marketing stunt. That's kinda sad.
Bro a sifu episode is actually ridiculous, I cannot wait to see what they do with this series.
Unreal F#$kin Tournament! I wanna see it!!! ☺🤗🤩😍
So excited for this, specifically Mega-Man, Pac-Man, and God of War
Song name? I NEED IT
1:16 Who/what is the pink character?
Prime lusting after LD&R so hard they had to pay its creator double just so he could do it for them...
I see some  Astartes inspiration
0:59, is that a Grey Knight ? the same type we saw in that Astartes project of the same guy who got hired to work on something official? Hmmm :3
If a one episode does not end here with  the main character getting caught and waking up in a cart on the way to execution, ill give this series 1/10
Did I just see Unreal Tournament?!?!?! What the..
Most of these games mentioned are trash---so we going to be watching leftover trash including Concord.
lol concord is in this garbage
WHERE IS WARFRAME ???
0:49 the daughter of spelunky guy in the lava level of spelunky 2, my god, its beautiful
why is there concord ? this game is the most embarrassing ever made. delete this
What's the song????
It looks cool but is Jack Black in it ?
LETS GOOOO SIFU MENTIONED🗣️🔥🔥
This is going be something amazing just by work put in this trailer
This reminds me that I still wish for a series in the portal universe. What happened in and with Aperture?
Alot of awsome games, and just as many games that nobody cares about and/or REALLY dont need a slot in this over other IPs. Like seriously, who the hell thought concord and crossfire needed a slot over half-life or doom
Man the fact concord take the place of any other game is a crime in itself So much game deserve it, not that  thing
It's like Arcane, but in space?
Mmmmm god of war necesita más que solo eso
I'm so excited the vibrations of my being are going to ignite the atmosphere ❤
What if they then make a game out of this? A game that spans multiple worlds and stories?
Where is zombies eat my neighbors
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED RRRAAAAAHHHHH
Speeece Mariinees
Aaaaaa Warhammer❤
They should replace concord with a black myth Wukong episode
concord🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao this show will forever be tarnished because of concord
The Pac is drone regular man chomping at his cord Pac's our machine Pac just can't be hacked, yeah!
Mega Man
"most beloved video games" or worst enough to make it on the list.😆
Well I’m putting my bet on the 40k episode being the mission Titus was just sent on. Also get fucked concord.
Captain N?
1：16
SPELUNKY!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
concord and new world aeternum being in this is troll asf
unfortunately no gears of war. Still looks epci though.
Hope the Astartes guy is in on it
The fact this show is stories based on "15 of your favorite videogames", yet somehow one of those "favorite videogames" of mine wasnt even released when this trailer was made, and shut down 2 weeks after launch....  I dont think this ahow is based on good videogames.
They could have added more iconic videogames. Instead they went with concord... The only one I care is megaman and he looks meh.
I wont watch this if by boy KNACK isnt here...
Concord is dead before this series release 😂
My guess is that they TRULY belived that concord would have won the gamers attention Even tho it didnt you can tell that this series has taken years in the kitchen so...they tried
0:50 Spelunky 2!!!
Quero ver muito the last of us
Did anyone else just see spelunky?
But yet there's actually no fucking Warhammer series show with Henry cavill? What the hell is wrong with you people
Sifu broooo! Let’s freaking go
Imagine if they animated anything from the Dishonored universe. Crazy.
Wow I'm glad Crossfire was one of the game chosen for this series.
Everyone’s talking about concord, but I’m surprised THIS is going to be our first look at the Outer Worlds 2.
I’m fanning tf out
If we get an Armored Core episode but no Dark Souls/Elden Ring episode, I'm taking my pitchfork and laying siege to the studio...
Why tf is Concord doing here lmao
I'm so excited to see Exodus.
BOOOOOOO
Does anyone know the name of the song in the background?
Please one of doom!
Concord???
Why in the f*** would they even have Concord here to begin with? What about doing some cooler shit for better amd more well known games?   The only ones that has a right to be on this list is:  Armored Core, Mega Man, PAC-MAN, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer  The rest are niche, generic and unknown by most.
Bro, I'm so watching this just to see the Concord episode
we need outlast 1 and 2 and 3 after the event of the troligy and trevor in grand theft auto V for sure
Thought this was ready player 2 for a sec
> most beloved video games > Concord  Amazon lying through their teeth.
dope. just gonna skip the concord episode lol
I cant wait to see who's Bi! Especially after Canceling Concord, its just straight up Using the LGBT as woman-face minstral shows lol its great!
Why the F is Concord there ???Overwatch made more sense
Concord didn't age well... but this series must have a season 2. IT LOOKS LIT!!!🔥
God of War, Ghost of Tushima, Space Marines. Lets go!!!!!
I feel bad for the developers of concord
Isso ai vai ser épico
Wow nice! Great initiative to make several pilot episodes of games, if any episode is really successful it could even be used as a whole series!
0:59 "MY FACE IS MY SHIELD!!!"
IT LOOKS AWESOME IM SO EXCITED!!! (≧∇≦)ﾉ
"Concord".  A game that only lasted a few days before shutting down? They should remove that episode, or it will go down as the cringiest episode ever
'From the visionaries behind Love, Death and Robots'  Shut up and take my money!
So THIS is where the Astartes guy went
Concord really got pulled form the shelves, I by they are in a panic trying to find something to replace concord
"With characters from your favourite games“ and you put Concord? Must be a Joke
Tf is Concord doing there
Lopez Richard Lopez James Harris Eric
VAMOOOOOS SALE MEGAMAN

Rip concord 😂
Concord~Concord~Concord~~~🤣🌼🪦
Laughing my a$$ of, watching Concord being here 😂
15 Stories Inspired By Your Favourite Games!   Concord is also here
can't wait to see the episode about my favorite game: Concord
They said "all your favorite series" then flashed Concord.. *Inhales Aaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 😂 😂 😂 😂
The Concord Episode will be wild :DDD
Gonna buy prime for this fr
Its gonna be hilarrius seeing the concord episode cus by the time its out the game will have been dead and offline for 3 months XD
rip concord
Saquen al muerto de concord de esa serie.
Concorde got canceled before this episode even came out
Seeing Unreal Tournament and Armored Core in the list has me hyped, ngl
Concord could very well be more of a success as a tv series than a video game which will then get a game adaptation of the series based on the game
Ready or not??
MEGAMAN!!!!!!
They need to go ahead and just not air that concord episode, literally no one wants to see it
Now THIS! This is something I will LOVE watching. I just hope for more series later on hopefully with things like Elden Ring, Mass Effect, Frostpunk and others in the future.
I don't know how we got to a point where we have Keanu in an Armored Core but I am so here for it.
Concord episode is going to hit different
1470 Eduardo Centers
I'm só happy ... I spend a long time for this 🥹♥️
"Beloved series" concord.
BT FROM TITANFALL 2?!! IM IN
Im Excited bout the Concord Episode, ngl!
Quero ver mais Megaman
Is that Abe from Oddworld?
I can't wait to see the episode about that Concord shit ahahahah
Concord 🤣
Wonder if they're still gonna keep the Concord short in this show after the recent news.
I can't wait for Concord, my favorite game.  That reminds me, I'm gonna go play it.  I didn't see any art for it in this trailer.  Come on Amazon, where are my favorite characters Daw and IT-Z?
Concord 🪦⚰️
''Concord'' 😆
FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!
WHERE THE HELL IS GERALT OF RIVIA??? (???????)
No uncharted? Lame
Concord is in this 😂
Concord being on here and then getting dropped after a week of release is so funny to me
Please make some WC, SC and Diablo. Thank you.
hope they just gonna erase the concord episode and act like it  never existed
0:51 Keanu!
Looks like a beta development reel of potential series. Amazon will turn the segment that receives the most online chatter into a full-blown show.
Man...we could've had Overwatch instead of Concord...
Yo, they need to get concord out of this show. That game is an embarrassment. Not even two weeks then gets shut down 🤦🏿‍♂️🙅🏿‍♂️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 can't wait to play it
15 stories inspired by your favorite games except Concord...
That Concord episode is going to feel awkward now...
looks like pure key jangling
Did Sony really thought Concord would be a massive hit!? Lmfao!!! 😂  Now I wonder if they are going to keep the Concord episode or delete it
concord sure is one of our most beloved games
Concord LUL
isn't concord getting one of these a game that is going to be dead
lmao concord is getting an episode.
Is this what happened to the guy working on Astartes?
megamannnnn finally have some animation
0:00 I recognize the power armored footstep sound effects from the Astartes animation… dare I hope
Replace Concord for Black Myth Wukong, or Stellar Blade.
I do wonder if they will remove concords episode. Nobody wants to see that dog shit.
Tf is concord doing there
lmfao the Concord episode 😂
No thanks
Demetrian Titus
So...is the Concord episode still going to be released?
"some of the most beloved video games" (Shows Concord) LMAO my sides
EPIC LEVEL 9000
Amazon, Replace Concord with Bejewelled 2 and my life is yours
Lol Concord failure in there as well.
"Come in You have a game to play"
Welp, that one episode is going to be awkward as hell 😂
Concord lol
Who’s here after Concord got shut down?
Holy shit the Concord episode is gonna be hilarious!
Guys guys guys! Wanna hear a joke? Concord died earlier that its episode has been released.
please please replace the concord ep with something good, imagine an infamous episode?? that would be fucking sick.
"come you have a game to play" except concord
We watched Pac-Man go through high school, get married, have kids, get divorced, get a new girlfriend, and save the world from a primarily magic and ghost themed rogue's gallery.  Now he's a roomba. This is a show by people who hate video games.
Liquid fart from concord
Concord, be a good sport, give the episode to wukong or sth
The fact that Concord has an episode after just being officially cancelled must be incredibly embarassing on so many levels
Will you cancel the Concord épisode ?
Where is Arthur Morgan damnit?!?!
One us up and cancel this shitty series
SOoooohhh UUUUHHHHHHHHH ABOUT THAT CONCORD EPISODE  Game literally couldn't last long enough to benefit from the free* advertising from the show.  ... the definition of counting the chicks before they've hatched 'and' putting all their eggs in one basket.
Imagine being uninformed about some of these games, so you do research after watching each episode, and find out that one of them was shut down after less than 2 weeks after its release.
Crossfire
so excited for Heather Anne Campbell's Outer Worlds episode!
Don’t let this flop please!   If this turns out into something awesome, I better see episodes dedicated to Cyberpunk 2077, Rainbow Six Siege, GhostRunner, Horizon Zero Dawn and maybe even Call Of Duty in the future
Pumped and thrilled enough to subscribe
Concord KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
I wonder how that Concord episode is going to be knowing it's already cancelled and refunded. Haha
The Concord Episode is gunna be weird...
Replace the Concord episode with something like Halo or Overwatch
WARHAMMER 40K..     Take the world...  it´s yours.
I love how they will show a video game that didn’t even last a full month before it was scrubbed from existence.
all the big hits are going to be towards the concord episode with the assumption it'd become lost media. guess you might have bites for the mega man episode. Honor of Kings looks like either an ad of pandering, game hasn't had a western release until the end of June. didn't it get reskinned on switch as Arena of Valor then EOS?
I was really hyped for this one but then I saw the trailer and now I'm worried for 2  reasons. 1. Out of all the games they could have picked for the series they had to go with an unknown mobile game, an upcoming game which I highly doubt if it is even going to see the light of day, Crossfire which aside of a couple asian territories no one else cares about it, not to mention that it had an abysmal game at Xbox Series X and then Concord like cmon man. Now don't get me wrong the lineup has some really awesome entries but there are many games out there that could have been adapted to an episode like : Assassin's Creed, Alan Wake, Returnal, Sly Cooper, Timesplitters, Dead Cells, Deadbolt, Dishonored, Overwatch, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, hell even if they needed to adapt a mobile game they could had gone with Temple Run, Angry Birds, Vector or Shadow Fight. But nooo they had to go with these ones even calling some of them like Concord or Exodus (which isn't even out yet) the most beloved games. 2. Love Death+Robots had a variety of animation styles that differ from one another. Like Fish Night looked different from Shapeshifters, or Three Robots looked different from Sonnie's Edge. But here some of them look almost the same, like we are watching those games cutscenes rather than their adaptation, only 3D CGI. Those are my reasons but I could be wrong and I hope I'm wrong cause I really loved Love Death + Robots and I hope Tim Miller does a great job with this show.
Bro this show is going to show the Concord episode 3 months after it's dead.  LULZ.
Bro yall better nor do SIFU dirty, thats one of my favorite characters..
Concord should be replaced with Halo
It’d be awesome if  the old cod zombies crew of Richthofen dempsy Nikolai and takeo had an episode.. right?
Including Concord really aged like milk
You think the guy who made the ASTARTES videos have been brought in from the Warhammer episode?
I can't wait for the Concord episode...
Who are all these people?
guys do you know this game at 1:15, I never heard of it. also who is the blue guy with red face at 1:16?
"... various PlayStation Studios games ..." Are they going to mishmash a bunch of games into one episode or a two-parter?  Something like the craziness of Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness?
So much for 'Concord'. Lmao.
Sony really thought Concord would take off instead of crashing and burning in 2 weeks
621, it's time for work
"15 stories inspired by your favorite games"....meanwhile Concord👀. Man Sony really thought they were cooking with Concord, to the point that they assumed it'd end up as a fan favorite even before its release. They also made a limited edition controller for it (and possibly more, but I sure hope not for their sakes). And now it's dead and buried within 2 weeks.💀🤣 Btw no hate on Secret Level and the ones who worked on this, it looks amazing.
That Concord episode is going to be mighty awkward
I'm surprised theres no Halo, CoD, CS, Valo, Siege, or any other big FPS besides crossfire which is rarely played in the west. Give the concord spot to one of those games pls.
Lmao they have concord in this?!! For all 600 fans of a game that doesn’t exist now and cost 250 million for PlayStation.
concord
Concord? What's a Concord? 😂
The only thing from gamecon that looked good
se these will be just ads for upcoming games?
update on Concord, it's servers are shutting down for good. RIP you won't be missed  250 million down the drain
so...is the "concord" ep pulled, as the game is🤣
An episode about ET murdering video game characters would have aged better than the Concord episode and this series isn't even out yet.   Concord lasted 10 days and this series comes out in 3 months.
This already aged so poorly before even being born! Concord is such a shitstain, Fortnite is more deserving of a spot here. Now that game actually brings something to the table, for better or worse.
i teared
Imagine releasing an episode of an unsuccesful game like Concord
Here before they take down this video to remake it without the Concord(ia) section.
1:15 💀
And Concord just shut down today, offering its buyers refunds.  So Secret Level will already be something of a museum piece even before it comes out!
some aweful choices of games though.......
LMFAOOO CONCORD THINKS ITS ON THE TEAM 💀💀
Concord 💀
I can soooo see them scrapping the concord episode
They should just take out the Concord episode and just give us a second Warhammer Episode
*Concord*
I can not wait for this! I also cant wait for the Henry Cavil wh40k series!
They gonna shelf the concord episode now, right?
Remember to take Concord out of it =)
concord, what are you gonna do about it
So, are you going to remove Concord from this?
What are they gonna do with the Concord episode now 💀💀💀
They should replace concord with Destiny or Mass Effect
Man, they were really banking on Concord being a success, weren't they-
This looks absolutely insane  I’m probably in the minority but I absolutely cannot wait for an outer worlds episode and I’m am always down for more warhammer animated stuff
so many dead games in this show wtf
Man they be advertising a dead game. Its concord
Aint no way they got Concord here!!!😂
Concord is dead, btw
Concord... 😂
Place your bets if the concord episode gets scrapped
the fact that concord is in this series and after 2 weeks from the announcement it officially dies is crazy 😭😭😭
So... what's gonna happen with the Concord episode now
cant wait for the concord episode!
So…. Concord is in the list of games… that game just got removed from the ps store for how bad it is… what’s next?
Concord XD that didnt age well
Hehehehehehe, Concord
SIFU >>>>> CONCORD
So, we still gonna get the concord episode or.....
CONCORD LMAO
1:15 Oops. Congrats on getting rights to dead IP
1:15 Aged so so bad
Here commemorating Concord you won't be missed, gonna be awkward when this airs o7
not me looking up the games that inspired this show.... im probably gonna pl;ay them before this comes out hopefully
IS THAT SPELUNKY
We need a metro exodus episode
LD&R? Yeah I'm in. Whatever you said, yes.
FU Sony what a bout Bloodborne???
I havent seen such a fantastic trailer for a long time
What kind of gun? I'm really looking forward to it, I'm looking forward to more than the birthday of all my relatives and the new year. According to the trailer, you can say that there will be something interesting, will it really be?... P.S. it's a bit of a pity that I didn't see Geralt, but that's okay, I allow the series to be released
Does anyone know if the 40k part was made by/with Syama Pedersen? It sure looks like the same art style as astartes ?
Hope this show goes viral
Kratos was standing in a modern city!?
AC looks bad
edit: from what I've read it's a stand alone thing from the Warhammer 40k series that was announced so never mind my bad.  wait so is there going to be a series on Warhammer 40k or not, because if it is this I don't want it.  I don't want other stuff and Warhammer I just want Warhammer. this is why I never got into love death robot because they ether half try or hole try on there narratives and it makes them look like a "crapy" coke head writer   so you get bounced around so much that you don't care anymore.
Primevideo NEEDS to bring LEGACY OF KAIN -SOUL REAVER as a series, theme, atmosphere, dialogue, soundtrack and MAGNIFICENT costumes!
Amazing
No elden ring? 😭😭😭
Sm1 noticed Keanu reeves
UT5 confirmed. *spreads rumours and hopes*
Is this a series or movie?
Opens up with 40k! Helllls yeahhhhh!!!! Better not be any female custodes though lol. Also... Concord? Wtf? So its your favorite video games.... and also the worst?
All AAA slop, of course.
Looks like AI made this for 15 years old. Well, to each to their own. Not my tea .
Wtf, concord is in there😂
I saw Megaman  and I got hyped this will be peak cinema
Unreal Tournament Warhammer New world aeternum playstation dungeons and dragons the outer worlds 2 pac man honor of kings  armored core  megaman exodus spelunky crossfire concord sifu this all franchises who will be in this series.
The Armored Core one is going to suck, isn't it? Same with the Mega Man one. Its best to go into these kinds of shows with your expectations set at the lowest possible level, especially when the show involves Amazon's influence.
1:15 Star Child Race from Concord, Sony really thought that the game would be BIG.
"In the age of ancients the world was unformed, shrouded by fog."
Need Knight of the Old Republic here.
Unreal tournament!
Looks like my Steam account Playlist 😂
AAAAA MUIYO TOPP
1:16  Concord 😂😂
No way Spelunky is getting a short?  LET THEM COOK
0:51 JIN SAKAI!!
I want one of Slime Rancher
Nah, mega mans return is a tv show that aint even about him?
Very excited: Megaman, Pac-Man, Armored Core. Mildly curious: God of War, Dungeons & Dragons. Good God, why?: Concord. Meh, whatever: The rest.
fucking pac man drone???
eww concord.
When the cover of the trailer is my shot 🤓❤️
Concord 😂 The only one who had to buy it's way in this glorified marketing AD.
1:15 SPELUNKY?!?!!??!!!??!!??!!???!!?!!!!???!?
0:49 SPELUNKY?!!?!!!?!!??
Top 5 Games I wanna see in this series:  5. Spec Ops: The Line 4. Celeste 3. Red Dead Redemption  2. Far Cry 3 1. PONG!!!
FOR THE EMPEROR
Vai ter de Concord kkkkkkkk
Ready Player One didn't need a sequel. This is going to be so shallow I'll have to lie face down to drown.
4738 Rolfson Harbor
This will be great just like LDR
The concord episode's gonna be the most skipped one
I'm certain everyone is going to skip the concord episode😂
Love Death + Robots = I am in
My fingers and toes are ALREADY crossed for a second season of this series, because good god the things I would do for a Bloodborne episode. please. please. ple
AahzAaAaaARmored coreee 😩😩😩😩😩
Is this a movie? Anyone ?
I'm gonna need an Elden Ring episode in season 2
Wtf is Concord there for?
Cool idea, I'm not interested in most of the games here but even if the show is bad it'll probably be entertaining at the very least
0:48 I hope Kratos In that scene where he fights Venom and maybe meet the Spidermen
Wheres  bloodborne 2: skillsong
Rooting for Guzzu to do some banger animations!
How does Amazon always get it right??!?
Finally something to watch on Prime 😅
for the emperor
Wait, *Concord?* Well I guess they had much higher expectations for *Concord.*
I am the chosen,.....give me access now! Lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 🥰
Wooot
I’m watching this for sure!
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA 2 RELEASE MIGHT COME AFTER THIS SO HYPEDDDD
0:51 was that Keanu?
That first scene is absolutely bonkers.
All you had to say was Love Death and Robots....I'm sold
Epic Games should rename the Unreal Engine to just the Engine. Unreal Tournament forever in our hurts. F Fortnite!
the hype for concord sees no bounds
Looks SICK. I thought I spotted Warhammer 40K Ultramarines, Ghost of Tsushima, God of War and Cyberpunk
Megaman ❤
Sifu has a unique art style this is gonna be interesting
This has Armored Core AND Unreal Tournament in it? My two favorite game series of all time?  Yeah, I'm in.
Thought it was Darth Plagueis from the acolyte in the thumbnail 💀
We're finally getting an Armored Core animation guys!
is this a game?
this is the best video game trailer i’ve ever seen
New World mentioned, cant wait to see that one
I don’t get it.  Guess I’m getting old.  Who knew???
We need more. Lord Cavill needs to make more! He knows he needs to make more!  One or two Episodes for Warhammer is not sufficient.
Super excited for D&D episode!!!!!
Looks like the world of Ready Player One if it were actually interesting. And from Love, Death + Robots? Sweeeet.
2024 is saved
Okay okay so.. is Kratos possibly time traveling or sum? If so, that would be insane 🔥🙌.
This show better have multiple seasons
Warhammer, for the emperor!!
Megaman Say no more  im sold
December???? I am willing to pay a Million dollars if this can be released next month.
Is this a video game or a movie?
When a metro series? That thing has potencial
I saw megaman and i screamed! I cant wait!
The warhammer short is literally the only one worth watching
bro crossfire tf
amazon finally stepping up coming out with a lot of bangers
Put jack black as pacman and im in
Armored core YEAHHH
Did I see concord 😂😅
0:48  MEGAMAAAAAAAAAAN!!! HES RELEVANT AGAIN-
HYPE!!!!!!!!!!
I hope all of them Team up
They added Unreal Tournament but not DOOM or QUAKE, I can't 😭😭😭 Anyway this will abosolutly turn out great.
2nd on Amazon prime but if Amazon doesn't like your reviews they ban you from rating. Never said anything inappropriate or harmful all I did was post a case of drinks with mold all over cardboard box it was sent in. The fall of Amazon prime starts with restrictions
I'm a simple guy. I pay my taxes. I just want to see a space marine cook. So please for the love of the flying spaghetti monster keep "the message" away from this so we can enjoy the series!
Finally Warhammer 40K!
@01:12 Looks like D&D's Tiamat  👍
I can't wait!!!
Yeaaahhhhhh❤❤❤❤ Gaming its Alive mpre than ever
This is heaven for Gamers…..
so much IP
Arcane, Sonic, now THIS.  2024 holiday season will be peak
no 4k? 1440? Come on, Netflix
Crossfire involved here?! Imma let em cook on this one. 🔥
Kratos in the modern times? He's in a city... either way I'm here for it.
I saw Space Marines. For the Emperor.
V?
"Shut up and take my money!!!"
A random anthology series episode is going to do more with Unreal Tournament than Epic Games has in 17 F*ing years :\
After they hit the Fallout show out of the park, I’m cautiously optimistic
Please make every episode at least an hour
on my birthday. Nice
no thank you. this looks like another ysen filled CGI fest meant to dazzle us with effects so we don't notice the shallow writing and acting.
concord💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Ach, yes... Exodus, my fave... oh, wait. It's not even released yet. Ups.
CONCORD LOL
What are you doıng Amazon? Whatever it is, please keep doing it....
💫💝👑🎁👏💕🔥 WOW !!!! 💫💝👑🎁👏💕🔥 quiero que sea Diciembre !!!  💫💝👑🎁👏💕🔥
Why do big studios even bother creating video game adaptations when actual fans do it so much better. I’ll watch this in a heartbeat. Hell, I’ll even watch the Concord one if it’s good regardless of the games performance
PLEASE! DOOM and Dead Space episodes for Season 2
This looks bonkers and I hope this will be good. I have no idea what this series will entail.
This is going to be the most attention Concord is ever going to get
I am hype incarnate 😳
Concord episode will be so funny
I really really pray they do a Titanfall episode for season 2
Massiv W
very nice
Holy shit Amazon. You put in first place a Marine chapter ❤❤❤❤ love you. Nobody says something about the  soundtrack?? OMFG EPICCCCC
Armored core? The aesthetic of that episode is gunna hit😫😫😫
Holy shit Amazon. You put in first place a Marine chapter ❤❤❤❤ love you. This is gonna be epic. All of them.
Space Marines - yes
Keanu is in it so I’m sold
Wasn’t Exodus a Bible game that was a rip-off of Crystal Mines or is this a different Exodus
Did I see destiny!!!!!!
Holy sh*tballs!
Ghost of Tsushima is in this! LETS GO!!!
They forget to add PUBG story line
Magnanimo🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hope this becomes the Black Mirror of gaming!
Concord? 🤣
Just got goosebumps!!!
Imagine them adding steve in the series 😂
My God, December 10th say less
I saw mega man, let’s go
From the creators of Love, Death + Robots!!! I m in 👍
DECEMBER??? i'll be dead till there, cant wait that much
This looks like a cool series. Especially since they got my boys Mega Man and Pac-Man involved!!! 😊
Pure hype can't wait.❤
Available in Hindi???
Huh. That actually seems neat!
Ready player one vibes
concord is nobody's favourite game
is 40wh
Halo…. 343…. Why did you choose to partner with paramount 😢
outer worlds mentioned. this is gonna be great.
"15 Stories inspired by your FAVOURITE games." *Shows Concord* Uh-huh. Sure.
I’ve been an Armored Core fan since AC2 and it is still so surreal to see the game get the level of respect that it has recently
Hindi Dubbed bhi karo iski
ARMORED COREEE
finalllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Can't wait to see concord one
By the time this comes out, Concord will be long gone XD
Hyped 🧙
MEGAMAN DETECTED
I saw Malcolm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY
Tras el cierre de Blue Protocol, Liberty le pasara lo mismo, con suerte estara en el mercado un año,  si no cambian de distribuidora, Amazon Games no tiene experiencia, a ese paso preocupa el mmo del señor de los anillos.
I cant believe they are doing Unreal Fuckin Tournament
DOSHOOOOOOOO!!!
Interesting
Concord…lol
BLOOD FOR GOD-EMPEROR, SKULLS FOR THE GOLDEN THRONE.
Tower of God?
That looks really good not gonna lie. Hope they stick to the ACTUAL games and lore none of that dei crap.
I cannot wait to see this shit!!
How you just gone speed past Kratos like that
I can’t wait!!
I heard the flopped DEI game ‘Concord’ is going to get its own episode, I wonder how many people will watch it.
Go Prime! So hyped that something like this was greenlit. The fans will reward this effort.
Concord? LOL.
When Blur studio decides to update its portfolio XD
MEGA MANNNN
I get goosebumps every time I see this
LET. THEM. COOK.  🔥
Spelunky 2 let’s goooooo!!!!
bruh, I thought that was mother fkin Darth Plagueis on that thumb nail
"You will open the door" Well, I've already played Kingdom Hearts, so...
That's Kratos, hellllllllllll yeaaaaaaaaaaah
i see Concord as an inspiration.....
I just came
CONCORD!!?????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amazing
all of this just a big ad cinematic trailer for their game...
Rip love death robots 💀
1:27 And that's Pac Man
Warhammer Episode better be made by Syama Pedersen (Astartes Creator)
So, episodes with different animation styles like LOVE, DEATH + ROBOTS ... i mean...
Hope they can get corridor to do an episode if they get a season 2. Of course they would be smart to bring back freddiew too
Wish they'd have done Halo as well, but this looks amazing
Who invited Concord?
SIFU
THIS LOOKS AWESOME
Is that kratos!?
Here for Warhammer 40K.
SO. MUCH. HYPE
That's PLAYER NUMBER 2, a sequel of PLAYER NUMBER 1.
Whoever's idea this was, give him a raise
SIFU? GOD OF WAR? GHOST OF TSUSHIMA? Count me in!
Anthology series featuring original stories set within "the worlds of some of the world's most beloved video games"  "world's most beloved video games...!?"  I don't think Concord is one of them, pal... What a big missed opportunity to include Dishonored, Bioshock, Blasphemous, Sekiro, Elden Ring or Black Myth Wukong... Concord!? seriously!?   *Just stop pleasing a non-existent audience!
Love it
Gajab bc 😮
Missed opportunity to not have Dishonored in the line up
Where's my kotor? :/
Ha ha ha ha. Concord.
WAS THAT FUCKING KEANU REEVES
Warframe definitely deserves a spot in this series.
I always thought of chorus being in something like this.
I dont play video games and even IM excited for this. To me, this is new and fresh and different. Hella excited🔥
Does this mean that there is no more "Love, Death + Robots"?
Just know if the team who created the love death and robots are apart of any film. It’s going to look like a masterpiece and astonishing. I love that team for their visionaries and style of animations. Can’t wait for another season of love death robots
oh yes  oh yes dont disapoint us please  (Warhammer 40000)
“It’s Levels To Dis!”
prime video the goat
I clicked wondering why there's a Tau in the tumbnail. Boy was I wrong.
Ok this is something different
The Emperor protects!!!
IS THAT ARMORED CORE 6 ?????????????
The PAC-MAN at the end is crazy
I hope the Pack Man episode takes itself too seriously for the LOLs. A dark and complicated drama about a pizza that eats ghosts.
I saw condord?
Dang, the website where I first heard of this series was mentioning Outer Wilds instead of Outer Worlds and I was already dreaming of an episode based on the Nomai expeditions 😭
Call of duty in this series?
Please add jonny silver hand with kianu reaves
@blizzard what are u waiting for Diablo series?
I saw Unreal Tournament in the description.. I'm a happy man. M-M-M-M-M-M-M-MONSTER KILL!!
Oya na 🔥
will the concord episode have more pronouns thn frames?
Looks like CHAT.I'm going to pass
How much did Concord devs drop to get included in this?
If it's as good as Love, Death and Robots it'll be a smash hit.
Finally some warhammer in mainstream
Lol @Concord being a part of this.
Why video game anrhology ...? Need original creation...
Astartes!
why is kratos in a modern city though, i guess the facty that they say playstation and not god of war might imply its not just an episode about kratos but might be some sort of playstation all star type cross over
Can't wait to watch all the ads with this!
I looked for this on prime video, thinking I could maybe add it to my list, but it’s not showing up in any searches. I guess it’s not really a show on prime. I mean it’s got a trailer, but nothing comes up when I search for it. Oh Well!
I really hope it's good cause of the production from Love, Death + Robots, but this trailer, as everything Amazon does game related feels like a generic asset flip meant for US consumers.
ALL IN
ik im like the only person who screamed armored core audibly at 0:45
We need season 2 and 3 already and it's not even out yet. That's how good I know it will be.
Kratos
Okay so this year just turned a corner and no I'm not fapping in the corner.
European looking box art megaman with astroboy graphic? Yessir.
WHOA!!! This is AWESOME! Super excited for this, especially that it's got Dungeons and Dragons, and super surprised of the whole new look of Mega Man and Pac-Man!!
Will Alberto Mielgo be there?!❤‍🔥
They put concord in it lol. Excited for them to goyslop all of these games at once so we can get back to quality sooner.
wait crossfire? hahaha filipino players of old crossfire will get nolstagia feels❤️❤️
so no more on Netflix?
I can’t wait for this on prime I liked love death and robots on Netflix
Concord!? Are you fucking kidding me? Out of all of the properties they could have chosen from and they have fucking Concord in this? What a fucking joke. A dead on arrival video game pushing bullshit
Tamil dub available ❤️
WOOOW - love it
Concord... lol
this is full of DEI. careful guyz don't be deceived
Les voy a ser sincero solo me interesa Warhammer
This is great but I’d love to see some more representation in a season 2 lol maybe some Xbox games
Sorry but concord the most dead game ever replace it please I’m sure the MK people would love to
Concord? 😂
1:15 Concord? Really? oh noes ...
Why isn't there Warframe in here?
Im in!
CONCORD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAA
Love and robots was awesome.. hope this is as good.
Prime,...Just DONT F**K UP! I swear to God, DONT F**K UP! Think at least three times before making risky decisions We're all tired of all this rainbow wildness, at least do something really cool and DONT F**K UP this project. Please!
When does this come out
Lol. I'll skip the Concord episode
Jaaaadu
I only wanted to watch the space marine episode and the sifu and also god of war
It´s about time...to Amazon made this kind of productions !
Amazon please deduct Concord trash from this series please 🙏🏽
Bom demais 😊❤️❤️🤜💯
For a brief moment I thought that was Titanfall.. oh how one can hope.
God of war series will come on amazon but not this year
Maybe we are watching the trailer of the future (one of the best series in history)👀
All right, as much as i fear live-action Game adaptations to be vanilla and anti-lore stuff, I truly love the creative freedom given to many animations. Can’t wait for this series!🔥   (also, shame on GW that it needs Amzn to bring out some quality WH40K content. But at least it starts getting interesting. Hope the great creators like Syama have their hands in this to works out)
Giving me vibes of ready player one
Sieht sehr interessant aus
This actually looks Amazing BUT, do they have free reign over the titles? Or do they have to follow video game guidelines? If so, I hope it can truly be different
auauauauaa
“FOR THE EMPERORRRR”
This is going to be amazing!
OMG... There's Crossfire too😭
Is it me, or does Pac-Man look like a robotic weapon device or something?
Ready player 2 looking crazy
Это просто охуенно!
you had me at love death robots finally my prime video is getting used
Wait. Did I see kratos?
beautiful
Seems like a deep a good stor
Most intrested for warhammer 40k
Why are this worthelless game ruining best character ever kratos?!
"Hell yeahhh" moment
Concord... Are you guys for real?
Concrod? Why?
Ohhhhhh , what's this feeling inside me. I am super hyped for this.
FOR THE EMPEROR!
Kratos?!
Not to be mean but... Concord? Really? One of the worst IPs of this year. At least we already know which will be the most hated episode of the season.
0:52 is that Keanu Reeves? 😍😍😍😍
From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots". Why is this a movie and not episodes of that show?
The number of games I recognize is very small. But at least one episode will be Warhammer and that is the important thing.
how funny it is that among these iconic franchises, which will make one series each, Sony apparently bought a place for a shameful failure called Concord
From beloved games and putting concord the biggest flop of the year inside.
Really put concord in there wtf
1:16 Hey wait, CONCORD??? Get the hell out of here concord >:(
Always white people at the center.
Reminds me of Halo Legends almost. Good to see a decent looking project again.
Oh God don't make me cry up for Jake from suit episode love death and robot. Please don't kill my favorite character.
A new anthology series?? Why couldn't they just finish love death and robots???
This shirt looks sexy
😱🥰😎
😮
Make full feature films for each one, Studios place your bets
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
At first I thought it was Arcane with the stunning graphics. Then star wars which I am derely not a fan of. Then I saw LDR, and im suddenly in
xmas come sooner this year
I’m so hard rn
Is this a movie or a game I cant tell
Goosebumps
So far "Warhammer Space Marines" action, is all I want to see
Abes odyssey?
This just looks like feature length ads.
I can't believe they're putting Sifu in this. That's one of my favorite games of all time, and I never would've expected it to be in such a big project. Super hyped for that.
I only pray Astartes worked on the warhammer episode.
I honestly can't believe this! An anthology series about video games is PHENOMENAL 🔥
Super fighting robot, MEGA MAN
Leave the gays out and I’ll watch it
Holy shit!!!!!!!
Do Stellaris
Is rnat darth plagueis
Holy shit, i'm locked in, thought it was warhammer, its more
TODOS LOS FANS DE SPELUNKY SALTANDOOOO (6 personas nada mas)
1:18  is that bloodborne
i saw Secret Level - Teaser Trailer, and was reminded of this ad
concord being in the same room as our "Favorite Games" makes no sense at all, game barely even launched days ago and everyone hates it, that episode is going to be the filler that no one cares about, even redfall got more players than concord....
Kratos
So what is this about
Can someone explain to me
As a gamer, I am so in!
New World
Concord? Guess Sony didn't expect it to tank so hard
Let them cook
Ready Player One?
Me ganhou!!!
did I see concord? lol DOA
Воу воу  Междумирец на превью
Did I see Kratos? Wtf?
Wow, what a great way to say goodbye to 2024! Cannot wait for this one
My reaction was 🤯
Unreal Tournament? WHAT YEAR IS THIS?
Coming this December.... ruined by badly timed inappropriate adverts...  "dont worry about adverts, they will be only at the start and never interfere with your show" yeah I call BS on that. I'm still a member until it runs out in November... so I watched a 1 hour show and there were 2 ad breaks in the first 30 mins.. so i turned it off and downloaded it... screw you amazon.  Nahh sorry .. You are getting dumped for being greedy.
you haven't add 'ghost's" story? then I'm not interested yet
LOL concord.... game is dead before launch. DEI ftw lmfao
Remembering how Amazon fucks up everything it touches...hard pass
This looks epic... can not wait to see it.
God of War serie pls 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Did Netflix sell the series to Prime? I am definitely going to watch this series.
I'm really only interested in the sifu stuff but this looks good
LMAO 'Concord ' :D
"set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games." ..... "Concord" ..... LMAO someone in the early project meeting was a bit optimistic about this one
Less Rings of Cringe, more quality video game cinematics
Baldurs gate 3?
💪🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yooo that concord episode boutta be the lowest viewed thing on amazon😮
Its been ages since i ever got exited for a tv show this much!
Oooooohhhhh! This could be amazing!
I hope my lady Jane do a cameo in it
More like [❤️‍🔥☠️🤖 ] = Take all my money 💳
Animation at its peak level 🔥🔥🔥... Hard to believe it's animation in some potions👌🏻... Also THALAIVAN KRATOS is there... 🔥🔥🔥
Okay, that teaser was sick..but seriously, what is this series all about??
kratos in modern life drive a car, it's gonna be interisting😍
Я хочу это увидеть.
THIS IS CINEMA!
Lol at concord 😂
Was that Kratos in a modern city?! Weapon upgrades anyone?!?
If THIS gets a Season 2, then I am hoping for Secret Level to add Call of Duty, Battlefield or Need for Speed.  I am STOKED and HYPED to see this!
what an amazing trailer
Excited for mega man.  I hope contra is in this
Finally more armoured core 6
I'll be watching if they don't pick male heroes and change them to female to "modernize" it.
Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype Hype
WOW !!!!
Wtf
Hope it's not trash
This why I love CGI for this stuff because there is no limits to what you can create. The only limit is your imagination. Can’t wait to see this.
Smash Bros Ultimate of CG animation films
Can’t wait for all of them except Concord
This is definitely be one of the series ever made.
No DOTA? That sucks
My somewhat realistic picks for season 2 and maybe 3  Street fighter 2 (Capcom)  Monster Hunter (Capcom)  Dragon’s Dogma (Capcom)  Devil May Cry (Capcom)  Resident Evil (Capcom)  Dead Rising (Capcom)  Castlevania: Sympathy of the Night (Konami)  Metal Gear Solid (Konami)  Silent Hill 2 (Konami)  Fallout: New Vegas (Bethesda)  Doom (Bethesda)  Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega)  Like a Dragon (Sega)  Halo (Microsoft)  Gears of War: E Day (Microsoft)  Uncharted (Playstation)  Twisted Metal Black (PlayStation)  PaRappa the Rapper (PlayStation)  Little Big Planet (PlayStation)  Final Fantasy (Square Enix)  Dragon Quest (Square Enix)  Elden Ring (Bandai Namco)  Tekken (Bandai Namco)  World of Warcraft (Blizzard)  StarCraft (Blizzard)  Assassins Creed (Ubisoft)  Far Cry (Ubisoft)  Rayman (Ubisoft)  Prince of Persia (Ubisoft)  Fortnite (Epic Games)  Five Nights at Freddy’s (Don’t Judge Me)  And lastly and most unlikely, the Nintendo franchises. Maybe if the series becomes big enough they might consider it but who knows  The Legend of Zelda (Nintendo)  Kirby (Nintendo)  Fire Emblem (Nintendo)  Xenoblade Chronicles (Nintendo)  Animal Crossing (Nintendo)  Punch-Out!! (Nintendo)
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED RAHHHH
Say less, looks really good! I'm ready for it!
"Your favorite video games".  How the hell did Concord get in there?  That game just came out and is dead on arrival?
Oh no not the Concord that flop game
DESTINY please
MASS EFFECT WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!
They should have done this YEARS ago.. everyone kept begging for small one shot episode of games they loved.. and NOW they do it... hmph i mean.. I am still gonna watch it, but I wont let them see me smile!
Any Kratos fans here???
Dear prime video please so please the series Hindi dubbed please
I don’t have faith in Amazon doing these stories justice and not making them “political” or push “the message”
Hey Amazon; more of this!
I'm excited for the warhammer one
"From the visionaries behind Lov...." I AM IN.
Concord?😂😂😂😂😂 A u srsly? 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kratos💀
I dont trust this at all... It looks too good
they could've chosen way better games, wtf is this list
Really no Bloodbourne 😔
Yeah, I'll definitely remember it by 10 December..... I don't know why they do long advertisement honestly
Megaman looks amazing!!!
OK Google Set hibernation alarm for December 2024
Ive always wanted to see a film made with that cinematic game trailer vfx and cgi... this might be it 🔥
15 stories inspired by your favorite games...  *[Tries to sneak in Concord]*
Hope Amazon will do better with this one then “Rings of Powerless” and “Wheel of shame” Otherwise we’ll have a cemetery of characters.
I always said a ghost of tsushima movie would be GOATED.
Amazon.. putting the “trans” in trans human since 402024.. probably
This can be incredible
Was there Keanu in there ?
Bro Netflix must of fumbled the bag, they really let the Love Death+Robots people Cook at Amazon. They should've saved the money there BS shows and paid them more.
Wow, this looks incredible.
He’ll yeah 🔥
YES
Licensing nightmare
20-30min long video game adaptations where we can actually see what works and what doesn’t, this will be great
20-30min long video game adaptations where we can actually see what works and what doesn’t, this will be great
If only we had halo: Master chief in this 😞
Wreck it ralph in a nutshell😂
Wreck it ralph in a nutshell😂
Did I just see Keanu Reeves 0:52-0:55
Jgn cari yg gk ada 😅
This Look Dope and Promising🤩
Wait this looks genuinely epic
I meeeeaaannn…. If it’s love death and robots people making this too, I’m already sold to watch it.
Meanwhile netflix is busy with lgtv inclusivity bs 😂😂
More syfy for kids...
Pov:And then you see a woman with a black blindfold and white hair
Tell me i wasn’t the only one that saw kratos
IN THE NAME OF THE GOD-EMPEROR OF MANKIND
Is this a game or series?
just, wow!
Really makes me hope that "Ready Player Two" will see the light of a movie release or even a series/miniseries.  Freaking loved Ready Player One.
w's in the chat
ohaaaa
DUDE I LOVE THIS AND IT'S GONNA RELEASE ON MY BDAY.
God I hope there's an episode based on Tom Clancy's The Division
This looks amazing 😀🤩
my god it said concord
I wonder if the guy who animated the Astartes warhammer mini series worked on the space marine part of this show. I saw that he was working with games workshop directly. that'd be a mad glow up.
For the longest time, I have wanted to watch a movie animated in the style of those CG game trailers like AC. That's going to be fulfilled with this. Can't wait!
"most beloved video games" "Concord" Lol, lmao even.
same concept as ready player one movie but more improve
is this like a TV series on amazon prime?
I am in
🤯
I'm actually hyped for that. Love Death and Robots had some amazing storys.
Wow ❤awesome ❤
Smokin hottttt !!!!!
Love death + Robots Video game edition is gonna be out before GTA6
Why am I getting Troll Hunter vibes ??
Count me in.
Animation Level Very High....Super..Looks Epic😍🤩
where’s RDR2 the film
Jin saakaaaiiiii!!!
Ok, now this is epic.
SECRET LEVEL ❤❤
scene switching at such fast pace kills the fun of watching a trailer...
Lol I love that each ep will also be free advertising for each pub/game but also fan service *vibrates with glee*
ఎప్పుడు ఒకటే స్క్రిప్ట్!
It's not the best choice, It's Spacer's Choice!
This trailer sounds like an intro from @tomorrowland :)
At first I thought it was fake but now....now I'm interested...and hyped...I'm interhypeted
I'm excited for the Space Marine episode! Warhammer 40,000 has come a long way in 37 Years since its inception
teaser gives the feel that, this is made for "theatrical experience" not for OTT
Can anyone mention which are all the 15 games ?
Santa’s come early. 🎅
I thought it was some kind of new normal game, but no, cartoons again...
Any god of war fans🙇🏻‍♂️
MEGAMAN OH MY!!!!!!! 😂
1:00 is that space marine running through one of those mad max car or a cultists car?
Waos
crossfire? like the board game with guns and steel bearings?
ARMORED CORE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Duuuuuuuuuumb😂
I LOVE LOVE DEATH AND ROBOTS 🌺🌺
MUCH AWAITED ❤
Finally a type of show that doesn’t follow the game, rather a whole new story (hopefully).
🔥❤✖️
Haven't been this hyped for anything in awhile. Looks like a solid experience!
Is that mfkn Mega Man? 😮
most love series bro ❤❤
If this is done right I expect the writers to be awarded!
Megaman fans: mmm migajas
I’m pretty sure I saw Kratos!!!
This looks amazing, although, i would've loved to see something about Halo. Unfortunately Halo fans are cooked 😞
Cool
With the games they picked for this trailer alone it really does seem like this anthology series will be a love letter to gaming. I mean it covers almost everything: FPS/Military games, Fantasy games, Sci-fi games, niche games, indie games, triple A big budget games, TTRPG's, flop games (Concord lol),  MOBAs, Narrative games, multiplayer games, 16-bit games (Megaman), and clasic arcade games (Pacman.)  I can't wait to watch this, and I hope that if it's good we get a Season 2.  It feels great to live through the time when video games finally get the respect they deserve as a medium, art form, and hobby.
This is what i waited so many years, when someone who have a brave and talent will create this series! LOVE IT!
0:50 kartos
Let me guess another dogsh!t movie produced by amazon
Whoa...
The animation🤤
Alright Amazon, you got me. Just don't f this up.
Thumbnail looks like Dr.doom 💚🟢🟩
Gamers.... We Won.
hype?
We like
I'm sold❤
0:49 god of war
Fuuuuuckkkkkyessssss
*Everybody liked that*
Nailed it.
is this a game or a movie?
For the Unreal Tournament fans: 0:48 Arena with corporate sponsors 0:50 The Necris and Team Thundercrash
Day one must watch
WAW
Ah vai ser um crime se n tiver segunda temporada, e uma afronta a sociedade se n tiver um souls nela ein
Almost 2025 and we're still doing "chosen one" shows?
Yesss more Mega Man animated stuff!
The Warhammer one looked like a continuation of astartes
Warhammer, Megaman, and GOW. I need this injected into my veins
This is super neat! I would love to see Halo in the mix!
Let’s fucking goooo!!!!!🚀
Megaman episode will feed families ❤
The opening being space marines actually gave me chills lfg. WH40K plus Amazon is finally happening. I have high hopes for this!! With it being made by the creators of LD&R I'm super excited! The snippets of animation for the 40K episode looks so clean sheeesh.
Is this a quick glimpse of Fatalis or which Dragon is that
Oki Love Death + Robots wibes i looking forward to this.
CONCORD!! They are really REALLY trying this hard to sell you this game😂😂
As soon as I saw love death and robots I was like I don't care anymore when it is coming out
You guys can already do the season 2
Love death robots don't you mean murder drones?
Wait... Darth Plagueis? Since when is Amazon doing star wars?!
Ok, I got goosebumps when I saw Megaman. All this by the LDR team?? O M G.
concord 🤣
Concord lmao
what's the song used in this trailer ?
well played Amazon. Now give me back Prime without ads and i will return to my subscription.
SIFU???
I CAN'T WAIT!!!
Kratos in modern city. Wtf are they going to make?
If this gets multiple seasons here’s what I want to see from Sony.  Sly Cooper Destiny 2 (we’ve been waiting for years and now is perfect) Ace Combat Infamous  Twisted metal Horizon Spyro or Crash  If anyone of the heavy hitters get a standalone film I’m would be very happy.
"CONCORD"HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
FROM DEATH LOVE ROBOT DAM I'M SO HYPE
I wonder if theyre gonna get the same actor to play kratos like in the god of war ragnarok game
Marvelous🎉🎉🎉
Oh December...
Wow wow wow I love being Blown away....
Love Deth + Robots has a unique vibe, the graphics and stories don't exist anywhere, I hope this show dilevers in that aspect.
Love death robo- enough said. 👏🏽
Ahh you miss the Shadow Fight 🗿
Might buy prime video just for this
0:27 Another girl boss who's the key to everything. Hard pass.
Im going to watch the ever loving shit out of this......
Concord? Why?
wHERE IS dARKSOULS OR BLOOD bORN?
Holy f*** sh888
Im on my knees, beggin yall to remove concord and put elden ring
This made me realise how much of a pessimist I've become when it comes to media. If I saw this as a kid, I would be freaking out. Now, as just barely a legal adult, I grimace at the flashy computer effects and the fact that money, time, and resources are going towards video game adaptations instead of real television and film.  But then again, I won't write it off until I actually get to watch it.
Hindi dubbed please
Whoo, can't wait for it!
If there isn't an episode dedicated to the secret cow level I'm gonna be really disappointed 🙂
Is it for gamers.....i am curious
Love Death + Robots was amazing work.  This will not disappoint either.
Finally an easier way to get into Warhammer
So Many Stories Yet Not A Single One That Combines Sci-Fi And Fantasy? Both Genres Have Been Around For Nearly A Century, But Not A Single Author Who Could Bring Both Genres Together, With Both The Genres Balanced Rather Than One Being Prevalent And Other Being Subtle Enough To Be Quistonable.  Well Some Examples Being Shadowrun, Final Fantasy VII
I hope it's over an hour long per episode
So it’s Ready Player One but less interesting. No thanks.
I love you ❤
I think I saw titanfall
It would be hilarious this Concord died before its episode premieres lmao
Oh prime your have earned yourself an renewal of subscription.
Uhm yes please
I'm just blown away by how good animations have gotten. Crazy stuff.
Can't wait! 😊
it seems beautiful, but why concord?
This looks so beautiful 😍
Epic
Essa série vai bater de frente com arcane hein 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is absolute genius
Why tf is no one talking about how it said pac-man. Wtf is the pac man episode going to look like?
I would definitely watch this...
hate this shit when they drop a teaser so early and the launch is so late
where is Bloodborne
"Concord" 😂
When are you gonna start working on God of war project ?
concord? hahahahaha
On one we have invincible series which has worst animation quality and on the other side we got this amazing animation , anyway excited for this.
someone finally made a series out of all those cinematic trailers we loved
LOL Concord. What a joke 😂
SHAADOW FIGHT 2 please
LDR fan club assemble...
ARTHUR MORGAN.?
who asked for CONCORD story? nobody plays that shit
I am eagerly waiting for this series.
İnşallah bölümler uzun olur
Amazing trailer, with iconic images. Will be a great sucess
Please tell me Syama Pedersen got hired to make this Astartes short. We need more of his talent in the 40k universe.
это будет офигенно
Space Marines ++
I am Soooooooooo HYPED !!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:53  yeayyyyyy....... Keanu Reeves 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ml kemana bos , kok hok masuk ?
Извините, а где СМУТА?
Kratossss
Would be awesome to see a warframe in this show
I am pretty sure I saw kratos in there
fookin hell, sign me folkin in
lol so THIS is why concord jumped the gun so hard
So thats where the astartes guy is
Oh my god this is going to be a epic movie trust me ❤
Souls Like?
I'm sold
Honestly, just looks like an another rainbow cast forced in a script NOONE cared to have them in. Won’t be watching they can waste their billions.
Where GTA?
Ohh
Fire !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
looks dope.
I also thought that was CyberPunk. I could have sworn I saw Kerrigan in there as well but her look isn't wildly unique in space sci-fi, so it was probably something else. No way StarCraft wouldn't be visibly billed.
I simply loved this trailer
.. finally something.... In the ❤ 💀🤖 🌌    We need something from Oats studios as well...miss those guys
Concord? i mean... for all those 500 players that play it? mmhkay
Looks heavy and good !
can someone write all 15 games that are gonna be referred to in this show
Did I saw halo ? OMG dyumm
Well done Amazon ..
Imagine kratos trying to cross the road, seeing cars for the first time, planes and all
I hope this becomes wildly successful and they do a Battletech/MechWarrior story in season 2.  I'm dying for that series to get the love it deserves
this is insane my god
Amazon’s Love death robots fr,….sure why not!
Wow❤
I see kratos !
Is that titus?????
Armored Core!!!! Finalmente sendo representado nas telas ❤
Where is DOTA?!
the second I saw the space marines from War Hammer, they had me
Concord episodes gonna be so good! I love that game!!
Prince of Persia???????
Hummm right 👽👽👽
we got "secret level" before LDR s4
i have no words other than thank you
I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS...
you want me to buy your premium? ok i will
sold
Armored core❤
Those drum sounds make me wanna beat my head into a wall in rhythm
Guys remember to skip the Concord Episode!
EGS score and normie games.
I was expecting marcus fenix...
Now i want Bloodborne
I cannot believe how unbelievably good LDR creators are. I am so happy they're growing. Many more amazing shows from them!
Esto es Cine 🍷
00:00 let’s goo, we waiting new astartes, but…
God of war
ohhhhh myyyyy lorrrrdddd. i am going to LOVE this
imagine a new trailer   with cj saying "ah shit here we go again".
"set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games" and at 1:15 Concord logo shows up. WTF
Yo This looks dope
if they make astartes a woman I'm gonna be pissed
I swear I saw doom guy
This is so hype, I had no idea this was coming! The naming is so special too, love it.
Spelunky being included is nuts
AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !!!!!
QUAKE plz
We eating good with ts one...
I loved LDR but Amazon's progressive decree are a cancer to the entertainment industry that defiled Tolkien's legacy. I do not trust them with 40k unless they give a real fan a bunch of money and just leave them alone.
Waiting for Gears of War, Halo, Cyberpunk, and Life is Strange
Megaman ????
Also we need another season of love death and robots too!!!
This is a pleasant surprise. Looks fucking amazing. Prime finally getting it, this is what people want to watch. And I much prefer cgi animated stories.
You had me until Concord.
i was dead waiting for Love death and robots next project.. but this one is also lookin incredible, im in there is story with SIFU ...wao ...waoo wao...its a new beginning
Sigan trayendo mas producciones animadas por favor <3
VALVE GET IN THIS TOO!!!!
If the guy who made the Astartes animations isn't involved with the 40K bits, you done goofed.
this gonna be insane!
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
WARHAMMER !!!
“Let these wretches taste the wrath of Ancient Vengeance!”           —Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines
Only amazon could have pulled that off
Omo!
Unreal Tournament?? Don't give me hope for a comeback from Epic Games after they delisted the whole series.  Still excited to see all of this ♥ great suprise that announcement :)
씨발 눈물이 나네 ㅠㅠ )
Exodus has not even released yet...but this show is based on BELOVED GAMES??
Concord?
Animation 💀💀
What kratos is doing there 😮
I'm extremely excited but sad that there's no Warframe on the game list
Is that game?
One of the best Christmas presents ever thank you!
We Want Resident evil
Take my money!!!
Keanu reeves😊
With so many licenses in the video game industry, they use Concord's but not Starcarft's, do you know what a chapter of that universe would be?
no way they used "concord" and "the most beloved video games" in the same sentence. Not even mentioning the fact that considering production time, the concord episode has been in production since before the existence of the game was even revealed to the public. Congratulations, we have reached a point in human history where we have beloved videogames we don't even know exist yet.
This looks amazing
Animation are amazing
NEVER THOUGHT ID SEE THE DAY SPELUNKY WOULD BE ANIMATED BUT HERE WE ARE!!
Did someone say Unreal Tournament?
Imaginen un capitulo de days gone seria epico.
Yes yes yes yes, this is the way, do only this the f warhammer, yes
this looks like itll be amazing. im very excited for this
I am excited but more scared, I am hoping this is as good as it looks and stupid is not involved with this, you know what i mean....
I'm in ❤😮
“Hey, Buddy, you ready to go Amazon Prime exclusive?” 😬🙌

Parece bom...
I hope destiny 2 will be featured
Love this format! Make anthologies a normal thing!
is it keanu reeves??????? in one frame i saw him
yesssss
I am SO watching this!!! Love, Death + Robots is one of my all-time favorite shows!!! You absolutely have NO IDEA how excited I am right now!!!! Plus, it comes out the day after my birthday!!!!
❤❤❤❤👍👍👍
No starcraft?
Warhammer 40k, Unreal Tournament and Armored Core. Very nice, especially looking forward to the Armored Core one.
Ummm, excuse me. Am I tripping or that's Keanu?
Am I the only who thought this was a video game from the thumbnail 😭
What a cool idea! Amazing
Concord in the line-up... lmao How does that saying go again?  don’t count your chickens before they hatch?
Where TF2
Darth Plagueis...
Such an intriguing concept
The ending sounded stupid.
LOL Fukin Concord! History in the makin!
Good job with this one, Amazon. Keep the seasons coming. There are so many more games to include!
Prime video is kindof the shit now
They should consider Deep Rock Galactic
Ah yes, *_Playstation_* , my favourite game of all time.
Wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why does the trailer lowkey go hard though
That is an impressive Teaser. I hope that they keep "ThE MEssaGe" out of it. Looks like it could be good.
Fvck.that's some top notch shit.i'm in.
1:13
realistic pac man is gonna go insane
Jin sakai 0:51
Arent they doing a full God of War series too? They really love Kratos at Amazon lol
Mega Man was my childhood.  I'm crying Q_Q
I'd love it if this becomes a regular thing, similar to Star Wars Visions, with studios doing their own animations for their games under the Secret Level umbrella.
WHY IS KRATOS IN A CITY
Bro I'm gonna say it this looks hype gonna watch it day 1
I really want a Witcher episode and Cyberpunk 2077 one.
DID THEY SAYS CROSSFIRE !!!!!
Concord?
0:00  literally evidence that we need a full space marine tv show
Looks amazing … Journalists of 2024 rate 4/10 for lack of diversity
This is beyond anything ever.
Concord..favorite game? You mean the lgbt game?
15 game titles but not the goat. No Black Mesa, no Gordon Freeman, no City17 😢
Yeah, imma be watching this
Concord? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love, Death + Robots is one of my fav series and this being made by the same people is so epic. The animation looks so cool and beautiful. Super excited for this!
AAAAAAAAAH
Spelunky is crazy lmao
MEGAMAN X please.....
holy shit
Please remind me when this is out!! Thanks! 💯💥
Crossfire is the best game I've ever played in my life!)
where is GTA V ?????  like if yall want a episode👇👇
Forgive me… I’m aroused!🤤
"Inspired by your favorite games" My favorite games: Tomb Raider Jedi: Survivor RDR2
Imagine a bloodborne inspired mini episode wow
Its like when sony puts all the playstation characters in a commercial. Always dope to see
Go watch love death robots everyone
What an unexpectedly awsome idea, I honestly can't wait!
Armored Core yesssssssss
FOR THE EMPEROR
GODDAMN
Excellent song choice
- What are we doing? - You are doing movies. *thinks for a moment* - Witch way? - In the direciton of movies.
Whole thing is obviously just a test water for what Amazon can get off the ground for in the nerd circuit. 40k is there because they want to see if the fan base will actually watch or if Cavill is a big talker.
Enough to make a grown person cry 🥹 its beautiful
This looks like utter crap
Please tell me cyberpunk is in there.
Its high time Netflix went packing😢😂
Absolute animation
need dark soul or elden ring before the fall
De verdad aparece Concord como un de los juegos mas amados? Juego que no llego ni a los 700 jugadores en su dia de estreno, halo de verdad no esta?
Ich kann es kaum erwarten
I'm here for Kratos ❤ what is this Secret level thing
i hope bethesda, xbox and CD Projekt Red do episodes too in Season 2
Was this created with Unreal Engine???
Did i just saw kratos there 😲😲
concord? Like the 700 players all time peak concord? That's one of 'our favorite' games? Fucken LOL  40k, Armored Core, Megaman, UT and God of War are gonna carry this shit.  WTF is a goddamn SEPULUNKY
So epic and fabulous!
1:03 Vic Viper from Gradius
I hope seasons will air faster than than Arcane do...
About time Amazon brings the fire! Megaman has waited in the shadows long enough!
I love this.
Give us new Stargate pls
Alternate title: 15 pilot episodes
0:50 jin sakai Got tooo !!
WH40K looks awfully familiar
Is that Concord I see in the description? Man, Sony really fucking thought lol. Rip the poor guys who got handed that script.
Woooooooooooo yes i I NEED THIS NOW WERE IS KRATOS
You guys are going to make a ton of money
This is going to be so awesome.
YES YES YES!! VIDYA GAMES!
Well it says love death and robots so 😅
so is it a game or movie?
holy shit!!!
"Unreal Tournament" Here we go again.  First Netflix treats Castlevania better than Konami, then Amazon treats UT better than Epic.
For the Emperor
I forgive them for not making season 4 of LD&R
I'm fucking exciting...... 🎉🎉
Looks so epic, I just really wish these were full length films. Same with love death robots, some of those animation styles were so awesome you just want more, and longer stories.
Guys we're getting the outer worlds 2 cinematic short
I really wish someone would take this level of story telling and animation to tell one great long story.  An actual 90 minute movie or a 3-10 part series.  These shorts always leave me wanting more of certain stories or animation types.
All the kids talking about games I don't know about ... I'm just here for MEGA MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
What the hell did you guys do to the animators...!
It's cool they included Warhammer!
We out here starving for new Mega Man content  And that funko pop game and amazon out here thinking we wanna see them specifically fix that 😭  Hell nah bro
Necesitamos esta serie en bluray 4k🤤🤤❤
If you told me a few years ago that we would get an adaptation of Armored Core (albeit as part of an anthology series) I would have called you a lunatic
0:51 Titanfall????!!!
What is cratos doing here?
754 non gamers
Love+death+robots never fails to get us excited even if they are making game episodes some of which we never played.
0:20 frame
Movies are so last century. Video games are the future of entertainment
Amazon should make  a death space series
♥
MEGAMAAAN
Bring it on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
My disappointment is immeasurable that there is no Titanfall
I have very little understanding of what I just watched but this looks very exciting
Watched it in my cellphone. Watched it my smartv. Watched....
What a time to be alive😢
Space Marine Warhammer 40K
!!I can't wait for the two characters from the mobile game 💪(Honor of Kings> Yi Xing and Ming🤩)!!❥♡♡♡ Let's Go HoKas people!
Favourite game ❤
woowwoow cant wait
Looks promising...😮😮
"Inspired by your favorite games" Concord??? really??
There's so many "chosen ones" these dayz, it's become a very common phenomenon.
We need to do this well so one of two things happen. 1. Second anthology season with more games 2. The episodes from season 1 act as pilots for standalone series
Em dias dias esse teaser tem mais like que Snow White...
I like how there's 3 games that are out and the rest are just upcoming games and they call it "your favorite games"
Thank you for giving me something i didn’t knew i needed ❤
Rise from the ashes of Rubicon.  Skulls for the golden throne blood for the God Emperor.
Ok i am hyped
For the boomers who can't absorb content at 60 hz: - Warhammer - Unreal Tournament - New World Aeternum - Playstation (GoW! in modern times) - Dungeons & Dragons - The Outer Worlds 2 - Pac Man - Honor of Kings - Armored Core - Megaman - Exodus - Spelunky - Crossfire - Concord - Sifu
Ready Player One 2?
YES
Where is Isaac Clark, where is he?
In the games titles that this show will feature there is 'PlayStation'. Could it be... Bloodborne?!
🔥
……. Woah…. 😧 this is incredible!
WOOHOOOO
"It's Just Like A Videogame!"
Who dafuq put concord in the same list as dungeons and dragons and other.. LMFAO.   That is hilarious
By the time this comes out people will be asking, what the hell’s a concord?
Diabotical Rogue
Prime tape fort, franchement plus le temps passe plus c'est une dinguerie ce qu'ils produisent.
FAAAAAAAHK, PUMPED!
Looks like Amazon prime gonna be the next Disney
Can't wait to see Musashi
So îs it a movie, or a game?
All of this is magical and beautifull ,but no one cared about New World aternum really just a shit game, the could have had like another big like elden ring or an horror game
Я так понимаю эра супергероев канула в лету. Настало время компьютерных игр!!! Не думаю что будет пушка, но гляну однозначно, что на этот раз запихали. Диабло бы уже полный метр выкатили.
Concord being here is literally that “Who invited my man blud? Bro thinks he on the team” meme.
armored core!! cant wait
WTF is concord doing here!      They could have use cyberpunk instead of that. 😂😂😂
I saw exodus on the games they will feature and immediately though it was metro exodus. I still hope it is metro exodus even though I haven't seen anything about it in the trailer...
What dat prime doin
These are each stand alone episodes?  I want my YouTube videos as short as possible. But my TV series as long as needed an concise.
Those SPace Marines sure look like Syamas work.
concord in the same team as all these big hitter: Bro thinks he';s on the team
Which game Intro Scene belongs too..does game also look like that?
I hope li bai appear in this one
isnt starwar and game of throne mixture?
Bruh Armored fucking Core?
Hype!
They need to do other from software games beside Armor core like dark soul, Elden Ring, sekiro  Elden ring Melina vs radhan would be epic
Pac man lol
This could be the last series of its kind. Soon everything will be done with AI.
Looks.... interesting. But what is this?
the most beloved video games - concord lol
Fanservice: The TV show
Noice
Fans of Mega Man. -It has been 20XX years...
Holy smokes! Can't wait!
Did I just see Kratos?
the tau are chicken
We are waiting for Love death & Robot - Season 4. When will it release?
Gaming anthology done by Love Death + Robots say no more I am in.
I am like WTF I just saw.
Great idea, however - Concord? Shows you that these people are clueless as to what they are doing.
Ok...I had no idea this was a thing, but I am in.
no prototype.................😢😢😢
Now this looks EPIC. Also did I just see Kratos? This is gonna be a blast.
Well, slap me twice and drink my juice...I'm In!😂
Chosen people are evil
epic
0:05 Warhammer 🔥🔥
I wonder if this is the project that Games Workshop hired the creator of the Astartes video series for
Hoping this series stays around for a while and continues to showcase a variety of fan favorites
Love death robots ... Take my money
Faltou a From Software ( Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring )
MEGA MAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN WOOOOOOO SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT MEGA MAN YESSSSSSSSSSS
How did concord get one and not the finals 😭?
Rompe el internet❤
Holy s**t unreal tournament?! No way! Playing through unreal at the moment thinking man I wish this was recognised again. I love unreal and unreal tournament and to have an anthology with it in it is just absolutely mind blowing to me!
❤😮
Let's make this shit star wars level
I don't think Kratos and Jin will have standalone episodes...looks like they're in same episode..
❤❤❤❤
Boooring
Kratos😮😮
Holy MOTHER of god. Seeing 40k and Armored Core is something.
Please make a subnautica episode for season two. It would be the most visually stunning thing ever. And I would love to have a horror/isolation type episode in this series. I need to feel what I felt playing that game for the first time again. 🙏
FOR THE EMPEROR RAAAAAAAHHH
Love it please make at least 10 season
IYKYK. The first scene with the ultramarines fighting the tzaangors is pretty much when Emperor TTS ordered the ultramarines to kidnap magnus and bring him back home. Lmao.
wow
bro, they chose outer world over outer wilds 💀💀
"Your favorite games" and they included Concord in this lol. Could that game be any more of a D-E-I game. Didnt Earn It spot in this show.
Amazing
Kratos and Jin Sakai... yeah I have a reason to live till December
Come on we’re waiting 🔥
Mass Effect and Half-life. Pls ❤❤
The only clip of spelunky they showed was Ana Spelunky dieing, and that alone tells me its gonna be accurate.
Kratos followed by Ana Spelunky is CRAZY
I’m not crying your crying.
Pandering with no substance: the show. Just like all the other representations, borderlands being the most recent example. Hell, even the trailer's music was cliche as balls. It will be the most surface level stuff imaginable.
Cool
Someone making Warhammer animated content outside of Games Workshop without a lawsuit? What parallel universe am I in?
omg star wars
This better be good. And I wonder how much f-ing money they had to spend to aquire licensing for this? xD Of course - I'm hyped for Space Marine one.  Btw at 0:52 - is this Keanu Reeves?
Sony REEEEEALLY thought concord was gonna be a hit huh? Lmao.
Honestly I'm not surprised if this cost more than rings of power but this looks awesome so prime will at least get their moneys worth unlike for that crap.
Super excited to see the Mega Man episode
No SQUARE ENIX with its Final Fantasy franchise? 😢 ah, bummer.....
The DEFINITION of fan tribute
If they don’t cast the original VAs for Kratos (Old Kratos) and Jin, I’m not watching it.
So this looks... kinda awesome?
Concord. Lol.
Freaking awesome!
The Outer Worlds 2😍😍😍
Am I the only one excited for the outer worlds 2?
An SBI production
well ill need more of that and some more tdr while am at it ha
If anyone is wondering about Pac-Man like me I think I have a theory in the cover of the video there’s some kind of alien creature and a floating ball, the ball Is Pac-Man at some point you also see them in some kind of waste land with structures, I think the mazes could be inside and last but not least my theory is kind of confirmed by the post confirming Pac-Man as a story in Instagram
I can’t wait for a Season 2 already. If it’s following the Trend of shows like LDR and Star Wars Visions, we can expect games like Destiny, Doom and other such titles that have yet to breach into other platforms of Media.  (I don’t think we will ever get a Halo though, cause we have the Halo show, and Microsoft is a bit of a turd when it comes to things like this. Cyberpunk and most any Riot game are also probably going to be excluded.)
no soul reaver? really?
I played crossfire x, can’t wait for that episode
¡MEGAMAN!😮😮😮😮😮 OMG!! YESSSSS!!!❤❤❤🎉
Is it just me or is it that both graphics and CGI look similar to "Ready player one" movie?
Omg Spelunky hyyyype!
The internet is dead theory is correct.
most beloved video games -> concord? seriously?
wow.  Give whoever came up with this and got the deals for the licenses done a promotion...
hell yeaaahh
I swear to God if this doesn't get more than 1 season I'm going to riot and I honestly hope to God we get a titanfall episode
The real og is fucking MegaMan
They better put me in the movie
BLOOD FOR THE EMPEROR, SKULLS FOR THE GOLDEN THRONE!
Awesome!
Hey.... Red dead Redemption possibility?
Spelunky easy w
N33d asap ❤ 😮
Kratos in the modern era. Excited to see his reactions to guns, cars and starbucks
This looks so insane!🤩
0:51 Jin Sakai ❤❤❤❤
You better make them like at least 20 minutes long each
h o l y s h i t. warhammer and ARMORED CORE? A ARMORED CORE SHOW!?!?
More Warhammer!
Can we please one from dead space? And one from max payne?
I'm so excited for the Warhammer one. The space marine shoulder checking the car GOES HARD
"Winter is coming", & people just got more excited for the holidays. This absolutely tops xmas decor that's already in stores during the Summer, LoL
Ok
40K hype!
What is this?
I don't care what's on the other end, this is how a trailer should be.
This looks absolutely fantastic, and I see Armored Core, but if there was SoulsBourne in this my soul would've leapt from my body
this is fantastic I'm so happy
This is what tv is meant to be, true entertainment
I've watched the trailer like 5 times already. Absolute cinema. 😢🎉🎉🎉🔥
Prime literally took the guys behind netflix love death robots and made this crazy animation ❤❤
erm wtf...
Unfortunately i haven't been able to play any of the games shown here, but i'll definitely watch this. You can see how much care and love people behind this show have for videogames
Kratos in a city? Okaaaaay
Did I just see a titan from titanfall??????
Did I just see pac man? 😂I'm in
Sp-SPELUNKY?! Why is Spelunky here? No dissing the game, but compared to other games, that gane looks like it has the least amount of story
Am I the only one who hopes that if they release a second season, they will release an episode of shadow of the colossus?
Armoured core lore baby!!!!!
Por favor, red dead 2
Release date
Wow😮
CROSSFIREKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK,
Exodus lets goooo
No Half-Life? No Halo? Disappoint  Still looks awesome tho
"This world has waited for your arrival." *The arrival :* "We have arrived and it is now that we perform our charge ...
It would be great, but it's a fuckin' primaris crap. The rest could be good though
I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS PLS JUST FCKING STOP😭
so instead of love death robots season 4 they went to amazon prime and called it "secret level" because amazon gives them more money than netflix ? are you kidding me ?
My all times favorite games Unreal Tournament and Armored Core. Grew up playing them. Can't believe I am getting this. Insane !
armored core lfg
Oh m’y god , oh m’y god its happening Space marine
This will be really hard to mess up
Armore Core T_T
you suck
This is gonna be fun
"Holy sh*t" watching kratos gave me goosebumps, can't wait to see it. please don't mess this up🙏🙏
Boy!
1:16 the best dwarf ive seen in animation
Whyyyyyyyyyyyy there's a few games and bring in unknowns, but important and interesting, popular and very good characters like leon Kennedy and Joel are thrown away like garbage. I am really sorry for you.
Something big been cooked here
Isso me lembr antigos CDs de clips músicas que minha mãe comprava pra mim😢😂
Unreal Tournament, huh? Too bad Epic pulled the entire series off of all stores.
Between this and Fallout, could we be getting a video game renaissance through television? I'm so hopeful 🙌🏼
Take my money ffs
0:01 crap comment
Bhain jaho kri Chalo copy ek Duje nu koi original na cheez banaiyo
Legendary series unlocked
I think iss gonna be Jhonny silverhand
you already know this is going to have some bangers in there.
You guys feel that ?
Its weird seeing an actual person getting into an AC
Crossfire and Honor of Kings nice hyped for this 🎉
First series that I'm excited for After Arcane
UNREAL TOURNAMENT?
From the visionaries of Love Death Robots   Just take my money 💰
Just get concord out of this😭
Themes: warhammer ,unreal tournament new world aeternum, Plaaystation , DnD , the outer worlds 2, pacman , Honor of kingss , armored core , megaman , exodus, spelunky , crossfire , concord and sifu
I don't get how this and the Yakuza Series are both on Amazon and for this one they use the games story to base their story and for the Yakuza show they said no one is allowed to know the game?????? How does that happen just use the already established IP for your advantage.
The ultimate bug man show.
I would love to see this concept applied to tabletop and ccg ips. Malifaux, Warmachine, Moonstone, Magic the Gathering etc.
Please for the love of god do warhammer proud. Heck just hire this group to do a warhammer anthology. I think you would find plenty of willing watchers.
I need starcraft in another season❤️‍🩹
Is this it for the warhammer 40k stuff? I hoped for more.
Amazon Prime had amazing releases the past 5-10 years and its getting better and better. They got all the money and the money is being well-spent. Thank you Amazon.
Jamie Oliver + paella??? Discuss
This is one of the best ideas for an anthology ever.
If they're gonna start a video game cinematic universe with this show, I'm gonna lose it.
0:49 BOYYYYY
Who is the honor of king character seen in the trailer?
Kann mir das jemand erklären? Ist das ein Trailer für eine Mega-Crossover-Animation oder ein Mega-Crossover-Spiel?Und sagen Sie mir bitte, wer die Ehre des Königsspiels vertritt? Lam?
Wow, didn't expect Crossfire here
Tell me this is not a work of speilberg
Prime knows how yo hit the right button don't they.
This may just be the coolest thing ive seen in a awhile. Cant wait
LETS. FREAKING. GOOO!!!
I wonder if protoman or X and zero will make an appearance, Ik X is from years after megaman but hopefully they all do
Anyone else thought that was Darth plageus in the thumbnail or am I tweaking?
บลิงท์ ทไวซ์
Give us an Elden Ring (or any soulbourne) episode or we riot
Menyala Amazon prime🔥
Lets goooooooooooo 😤🔥🔥🔥
How the hell did a dogpile dead game like New World get featured on this 💀
Finally after 2 years we will experience love, death, and robot again
Fucking Yes from Pakistan ❤
Надеюсь, будет история по "Смуте"
If this is a big hit we could be in for some incredible adaptations in the future
Omg I can't wait 🔥
ah yes, spelunky... MY ENEMY
Speess mehrines??
Looks awesome but lets be real no one asked for Concord.
всё в кучу.... и говно и цветочки и салатик и бубочки
Ready Player One if it was good?
So... am I supposed to watch this or play this?
wait..titus?
how the fk did Concord get to be in there?????? It's literally an unknown and dog water game. isn't it too obvious already.
I think that this may be the single greatest idea to ever come from nerd culture.
Did you say Love, death + robots? Count me in 🥳
When Netflix shuts you down, prime steps in 😎
15 favourite games and put in Concord which was just released around yesterday and it sucks compare to the other games in the same genre like overwatch, valorant, ...
Yes
Cool
Where's the 3 minute Borderlands cartoon that would have totally shamed the Borderlands movie?
"They catch you to?" "Yeah...yea." "Pretty good bait this time." "Yeah...got hooked by Sifu and dragged by Kratos." "Mmm well , just wait Gears is next."
But will they be shorts again? Because I don't get that
Wow. Looks like Blur studio's work. Pretty dang amazing. Psyched to see this.
Hmm. weird.
t thought they have skyrim
Man, i hope this gets people to watch Love, death, robots. I'm hyped for this. Their shorts on netflix are amazing.
CF?!
ARMORED CORE
Izanagi Corporation? Riordan Dynamics!? Double Kill, Multi-kill, Mega-kill, Ultra-kill, KILLING SPREE, M-M-Monster-Kill, Ludicrous Kill Kill Kill! HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT! RAMPAGE!  *UNREAL TOURNAMENT*
Holly shit!
can't wait dogs
This could easily be the best announce of the year
Falun Gong practitioners hosted the “Stop the CCP’s Live Organ Harvesting Poster Exhibition” at the Asaka City Industrial Culture Center in Saitama Prefecture from September 29 to October 1, 2023.  On the last day of the exhibition, the organizers screened “Human Harvest,” a documentary about the state-sanctioned human organ harvesting from living practitioners, including the active transplant chain in China. After seeing the poster exhibition and the documentary, people in the audience said they had a deeper understanding of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) willingness to commit atrocities and wanted more information about Falun Gong.   The “Stop the CCP’s Live Organ Harvesting Poster Exhibition” was held at the Asaka City Industrial Culture Center from September 29 to October 1.   Screening “Human Harvest,” a documentary about the state-sanctioned human organ harvesting from living practitioners in China  Viewers Shocked at the CCP’s Atrocities In addition to the posters, in a separate room, visitors could watch videos detailing human organ harvesting crimes from living practitioners in China. People’s expressions turned solemn after learning the facts, and some were even moved to tears, stunned that such cruelty can still occur in this day and age.  A woman in her 50s said, “I had never heard about this. It’s so cruel. I was so shocked that I couldn’t speak.” Through tears, she asked what she could do to help.  A commentator told her that people could talk to their legislative representatives to pass a law to stop the crime and that some local councils had passed resolutions that they submitted to Congress. The woman said she would share the information with her friends and would bring them when the event returns.  A teenage girl said that this was the first time she’d heard about organ harvesting from the living. “It’s very sad that so many people have had their organs harvested while they were still alive.” She wanted to do something to help, so she said that she would tell her friends. She also took photos to share online.  A man came to see the poster exhibition with his high school daughter. “I saw the flier that said, ‘Silence means siding with the persecutors’ and felt that I had to come and learn the truth.” He also said that he would bring his friends when the event returns.  A man in his 50s said, “Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to learn the facts. I didn’t know that the CCP was responsible for such evil. I don’t think Taiwan should become part of China. I will tell others I know what I saw today.”
I saw DND on this and immediatly lost my shit. Prime be cookin with this one
Muchas gracias por esto.
te amo amazon
Hope we get these games free on prime gaming ❤❤❤
Can’t believe we’re going from a series of imaginative free-form stories with little to no restrictions to a string of veiled commercials for IP-farms.
They got concord on there? Holy shit, lmfao.
0:46 MEGAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!
better without concord, it's a trash.
Warhammer and Unreal Tournament? Yes please.
The fact we have armored core is actually crazy to me, im so excited.
Yes i got it it will be like love death and robot .
Space Marines 💀
What exactly is this ? Just a conglomeration of a bunch of short films of great games? Honestly curious. I saw 40k and instantly clicked thinking it was a 40k show
"15 Of your favorite videogames" *shows Concord*
THANK YOU - I AM READY  P1 PS: I LOVE YOU!
How the hell did Honor of Kings get this one?
the creators of love death + robots better not actually FORGET about love death robots + robots 🥺 we need both!
Kratos took a wrong turn on that boat.  Looks like he will be fighting the strongest gods of all: The tech bros.
Please don't suck.
So hype
No witcher?
Quality Mega Man media is extremely rare, even more so than new entries in the franchise. I really hope Secret Level handles the lore with care. Poor Mega Man has been through enough already.
Armored Core already has me sold, lmao. AC6 is a phenomenal game in its own right.
Is this that Border Land movie?
Can't wait until December
At 52 seconds, was it Keanu?
okay keanu
Amazon the New Playstation coming next year.
The catch is the main character is non-binary system....... 😂😂😂😂😂
This is like a waking dream
finally something new
05:50
0:50 God of war
“What a wonderful day” we all say in unison
Ready player two
4k trailer please?
ARMORED CORE LET’S GO
Man i wanted Halo to be on that list so so bad.
UNREAL TOURNAMENT! I used to be number one in the world in this game back in 2000.
Just imagine if in the second season other games like Metroid, Crash, Donkey Kong, Sonic, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, GTA, Mario, Pokémon, or even Resident and Castlevania had their perfect adaptation
Perhaps the best gaming art I have ever seen....
1:12 Tiamat is that you?
This is what everyone has always wanted.
Crossfire
Sifu!
If we don't get Arkham Batman here I'm gonna be pissed, SQKJL was Garbage
concord doesn't deserve to be on there. ill just skip that episode.
G
Very reminiscent of some playstation ads. Hype.
keanu reeves in an armored core short is something i didn’t have in my 2024 bingo card  jesus christ im so hyped for this show
👌👌👌👌👌
MEGA - MAN!
In a way, this is a return to form for Blur Studios! I know they've been making awesome films and shows lately, but lest we forget they built that empire producing the best video game cinematic trailers.
Megaman getting some love??? GIMME
Ok guys, this is cinema
ARMORED CORE!!!!
oha
I've never been so hyped
I guess that someone has watched Star Wars: Visions and thought "I have an idea for a series"
Okay LD+R is legitimately a credential you can use to draw me in. The beauty of LD+R is that it completely kicks over the generic shovelware never-ending series style that's so prevalent nowadays, and leads to ever-deteriorating storylines. Each LD+R story however is a carefully crafted self-contained setting, where the writer actually needs to think about every second, as to convey the entire setting and story in shortfilm format.  So yeah... I might just have to actually grab a Prime account for once, this might be worth running through the 27 layers of torture that is Amazon's abo (and cancellation) system.
Just by putting "Love, death, robots" is enough motivation for me to watch this ❤
Love Death and Robots. And Megaman. Let's fkn go.
I wanna see the 40k one. If its good this show will be the new 🔥 show to watch.
FUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The fact they’re including Unreal Tournament makes me unbelievably happy. That was my og shooter experience
found where they put the astartes team
Darth Plegius
Omg Unreal tournament, thanks guys
Where's Resident Evil and Silent Hill? That aside, this looks badass. Finally an anthology show about video games!
Unreal MOTHER FUCKING Tournament
0:51 Jin Sakai hype
4K Quality?
The Space Marine shoulder checking a oncoming vehicle was amazing.
What the f@%k did we just watch.
I hope the episodes are not as short as the LD+R ones.
Darth Plagueis be sneak peeking again in the thumbnail
Everything but concord looks fire
You see how good stuff can be when you do your own thing and don’t destroy existing IPs like Lord of the forking Rings? Oh wait…
came for the videogames, stayed for the videogames
Why does Concord get an episode? Why not elder scrolls or something.
I was waiting for a titanfall the entire trailer
IS THAT MEGAMAN
NO WAY GHOST OF TSUSHIMA AND GOD OF WAR
Psyched to see CTF-Face in this trailer :D UT!
Unreal Tournament ❤️   Bring this franchise back from the dead and give it a forge mode like Halo and custom games.  I would play no other FPS.
Woooow it’s so cool but why not on the Netflix?
In!
I smell a hit, amazon is killing it
Metal Gear Solid for season 2 plz!
CONCORD YOOOO
HELP I THOUGHT MY FRIEND WAS JOKING ABOUT THE SPELUNKY TV SHOW
😮 nice
Hoping to see S.O.M.A there
For the Emperor!
ID LOVE TO WATCH THIS IF I DIDNT HAVE TO PAY FOR ADS.
Praise the gods! more warhammer animation!
0:49 what?
Ready Player One but good.
Please continue love death robots
Bro the beat is insane
I'm so in. Almost got a boned while watching this.
I love this and its 15 OMG!
HERE FOR 40K! Should've shown an Astartes doing something really extraordinary though, they shoulder check a speeding vehicle head on every morning as a warm up so it's pretty ho-hum.
i dream about this around Skyrim Lore . One Day Maybe .
Holy shit, this idea is so cool, I'm so excited.
Thumbnail is Darth Plagues the wise
Greatest games ever? I never even heard of half of these titles. I recognized Kratos, Tiamat and Mega-Man and the space marines, but that's about it. What the hell is even Spellfunky???
Despiertenme en el Diciembre 10
Doom would be nice too
omg, my baby Unreal Tournament 😭😭😭
This is gonna be epic😮
Mega Man HYPE!!!!!
Come on sifu has five villains and a big story so why can't they just make it about sifu instead of the other games in to one show it's just not right 😡
This reminds me of pixels with Adam sandler
PACMAN SHOW
a sifu episode? i'm in heaven. this could be awesome
Why is Amazon the God of 2024?
I dunno about the others, but Astartes set the bar so nonsensically high for anything related to 40k space marines that anything that comes out will always be compared to it.
Thanks Tim Miller!
Let's hope they put all at once and don't screw Xmas by splitting it until 2025
Do more of such series based on video game guys.
God of war
Big Daddy Kratos Is Here!!!
So hyped
Okay I'm calling it it says different stories I would like that it would be different stories but I would like all of the stories to be interconnected somehow like maybe the boy or the man is traveling through these worlds trying to find something and he can interact with all these different characters because if that is so oh my God this is going to be ready player one level of universe connectivity. And when you think about it that is dope
Bloodborne fans crying rn 😭
ARMORED CORE LETS FUCKIN GO!!!!
That space marine smashing into that vehicle already looks epic
Amazon making moves.
Wow this looks like shit
I hope they got the guy who did Astartes for the Warhammer 40k episode.
Whoever thought this concept up is a genius!!!!!  Can't wait to see this!
Sad, now I have to get Prime.
And Jin Sakai here
How much Concord pay to be in this bruh?
kinda cringe
The king of fighter please
Ghost of Tsushima 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Megaman is 100% the most important part about this...
Warhammer 40k 😍 Amazon don't do the heresy of taking the warhammer mission lightly, do the work seriously or don't do it
The ultimate "It's just a game" compilation
This is what I've been asking for- lets have these mega studios start dumping money into animation to where it can attract everyone and anyone! Animation is the bridge to imagination and reality, tech is getting sooo good at making these looks so real <3
I feel like titanfall 2 should get some sort of continuation through this. Or Sekiro... sekiro would epiccccc
Unreal Tournament episode.. ayoo sign me up
A anthology of quick-fire animated adaptation of games, handled by Blur Studios (LD+R) and likely involving many effect studios going at it as if they were doing cinematic contract work? You have my attention...
At 1:28 Pac man
man you gotta do big titles in the next iteration, mass effect, gears of war, GTA, DMC, Elden Ring, Doom, hitman, Dishonoured (pls)
So this is why they didn’t announced fourth season of love dead and robot. Sign me on!
That you, Plagueis?
holy ship
Mass effect
This looks insane! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I saw kratos
It's going to be broing af
Vous allez détruire 40k en en faisant un dessin animé pour enfant, vous n'avez que l'argent en tête, c'est tout ce qui compte pour vous, l'oeuvre vous vous en carrer profondément.
JIN FUCKING SAKAI LETS FUCKING GOO THATS MY BOY
Goddamn it take my money bezos.
ARMORED CORE!!!
Sifu is such a banger bro
They should release another trailer in a few months
Megaman got me hyped it looks crazy
But these a-holes behind sony cant comprehend the idea of more bloodborne content, They wish to deprive and starve their own fanbase. Still the trailer looks sick and i'm excited for GOW and Ghost Of Tsushima
0:51 Jin Sakai
Next time on Licensing: Chronicles: Legends: Origins
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA LETS GOOOO
Diciembre aquí vamos
Keep the Armored Core love going!!!
Give us Xan Kriegor fro UT and i will be extremely happy
My only issue with LD+R is that the best episodes are not turned into full-length movies or at least a multi-episode series in each universe.
Am I the only one who’s crying cuz Warhammer has to share its tv show
Concord?  Is this really something to add? Especially to a list of favorite games? Who has that as their favorite?
BRO WTF THIS IS INSANE.
I'm intrigued
😱😱😱😱👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
0:48 Kratos?!
Live Action 😢
Sifuuuu yessss
Chills, I have chills this is sick hope it's as good as it seems
Unreal Tournament!? That makes my mid-30’s self so hyped. I do wish we’d get a proper UT game though :/
UNREAL TOURNAMENT???
Prime always cooking
"Concord" lol
So Kratos got isekied ?🤣
0:47 ...Is that... Megaman?  EDIT: Holy shit, it was!
Essa parece ser uma série incrível, love Death and robots e muito boa, grandes chances dessa ser boa também
Looks neat.
ARMORED CORE IDENTIFIED, COMMENCING HYPE!!!
De una
If we ever get a secret level 2, I hope they add minecraft
Concord bought its way into this. Guess I'll skip that episode of this DOA-game.
This is f...g Unreal (Tournament)!
Cant wait to hear the iconic line of John Rubicon: Every Armor has its Core
Please add Cyberpunk 2077! it's would be cool
WARHAMMER MENTIONED
amazon, faz uma serie de world of warcraft, nunca te pedi nada
"15 stories inspired by your FAVORITE GAMES" *shows Concord*
Looking forward to the 40k show.
If this gets a second season, they should make episodes about Nintendo games, or Sega.
Insane!
SO MANY GAMES: 😮😃 *CONCORD: bruh 😑🫥
Unreal Tournament? UNREAL FUCKING TOURNAMENT?!
Megaman included is such a coicidence.
an anthology series from your favorite games... and also Concord.
PAC MAN?!?!??
Please please PLEASE let this be good. I haven't seen Love, Death + Robots, but I've heard good things. We need this to be successful so video game shows and movies are taken more seriously and given more love and care. For every Sonic, there are 20 Borderlands.
I got chills
They really cook this time, Love Death & Robot was a awesome seried btw
Where is STARCRAFT?
Borderlands should've tried this first.
YESSSSSSSSSSS
Ghost of Tsushima is going to be INSANE! Jin Sakai, the mongols, lord shimura... The hype is on!!
JIN SAKAI
Cried thanks for one for us
Lets fucking go man
não entendi bulhufas kkkk
Pac man looks like a langolier, I am scared
Still waiting for the Jet Set Willy movie then...
Ok, i love you now
JUST GIVE ME SPACE MARINES !!!!!!
If there's anything the reaction to this has shown me it's that people will see the mass consolidation of all entertainment around washed out pop culture franchises and nothing else and think it's a good thing
Ghost of Tsushima???
I dont trust Amazon for this to not be terrible
WHAAAAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!???? This is going to be....EPIC!!!
This series will be a banger hopefully some executives are paying attention and will use this show as a testing bed for individual shows based on popularity I know I’ll be watching that warhammer ep a ton when it’s out Netflix should have done the same with love death and robots so many awesome shows could have spawned from that.
Yes!
Looks great.  How is this animation done???
Ok this is the sauce.
Dungeons & Dragons .... AND Warhammer .... and even things like God of War etc. .... TAKE MY MONEY <3 <3 <3 <3
Soooooooooo flippin awesome!!!
Pacman 1:26
Seeing a spacemarine shoulder check a speeding vehicle is all i need. Im in
They tried to sneak in Concord among the favorites
Imagine Sakai Jin helping the main characters after they killed mongols together! 🔥🔥🔥
I really enjoyed Outer Worlds.  Excited to see that episode.
***Soils Underwear***
From the people behind Love Death + Robot is all I needed to know, I’m sold.
👍👍
If only we got a Halo episode
Space Marines fighting dragons? Sure.
Oh, It's Darth Plagueis!
take my money
Whoever came up with this idea, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH BUDDY !!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
( ｡ •̀ ᴖ •́ ｡) - Not much to say, just disappoitment.
Я очень надеюсь, что это не будут такие же короткие видео, по 5-10 минут, как в Любовь, смерть и роботы
I do hope there is a Days Gone episode where they address the cliffhanger ending..
That thumbnail alone is better than what the Acolyte did with Plagueis...
I hope in the future, there's a Portal or Half Life episode.
My jaw dropped
Mega Man super fighting robot 🤖😍🥳🎉
I hope they can get into the world of Stellar Blade too
Since they got Armored Core and Megaman i wish they do Soulsborne and Monster Hunter as well in the Future
Already hoping for another after this with even more included
Omg megaman and God of war 😦😦🤯🤯
You say "Love, death and Robots" you got my attention but does this mean that series is over?
Mega Man, Pac-Man, D&D and a bunch of stuff most people have probably never heard of.  In other news, SEGA is developing an Eternal Champions movie. It's nice that filmmakers are finally giving video games a fair chance, but some of these project choices could set VG films back at least another decade.
Ave imperator!
Man they really went rogue in this new season of Arcane
I was wondering why there is no new season for Love Death And Robots. Now i know it and I'm now hooked for this new movie
0:59 - that is what we want.
It’s like they r giving us what we wanted and we didn’t even fucking ask for it
this will be epic, Prime if ya wanna do this well. stick to the lore and dialog already out. dont make up crap like they did with halo and dont flop like borderlands!
this is a really big stretch, but with characters like kratos, pac-man, and megaman, who all either havent had their own game in a while, or have a new game in the works, (GOW), maybe at the end of each episode, there could be an announcement for the game series the episode is adapting. like for example, a Ghost Of Tsushima 2 announced at the end of the episode. or maybe even a sifu dlc, or sequel announced. (i now really want this too happen.)
0:00 smells Syama Pedersen's job a lot guys !!!
All jokes aside, the fact we're seeing 40K in this is an *incredibly* good omen. We all know how stingy GW is with their IPs.
That's awesome. ❤💀🤖 Has been taking a long time for that season 4
HEEEEEEEELLLLL YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!! FINALLY LEESTS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Sakai Jin at 0:51
I really hope in season 2 they make a episode on Warframe
Love death and robot ❤️ ☠️ 🤖
Having songs in this movie would be a dream come true😭
the AI sure loves this thing....   because the AI is probably the one who made it :(
Well this looks awfully sick!
Dude, I'm so IN!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m surprised there isn’t a Splinter Cell short, Ubi Soft likes to do everything with the IP except make a new game.
Purple Darth Plageius
Warhammer ❤
If there is ever a season 2 plz add Helldivers 2!!!
0:58 Super Fighting robot.. wait Mega Man!? ⚙️🔩
2:26 Lost Soul Aside?
Love Death & Robots was the best anthology series i've ever watched and I have high hopes for this, too.
Wow🔥🔥 Brother!!
Cade Super Mario Bros, Sonic, Crash Bandicoot, Terraria, Super Metroid and Minecraft

darth plagueis in the thumbnail
space marine perfect~!!!
warhammer  hope it's good,  the others, who cares
Is that mags man!!!!! Yes
AMORED COREEEEE
Now…part of me kinda want Quake 2 and 4. Like it was a shame that Quake Champions comic got canned and won’t see modern take on Quake 2 lore (at least perspective of marines from Operation Alien Overlord).
Ok Prime. I will keep my subscription going.
ARMORED CCOOOOOREEEEEE
They could of just added one more to the mix destiny 2 😭
Please , Don't show human's face in Armored Core ....
That biblically accurate Pac Man on the end tho.
Amazed no one thought of doing that - or at leas on such a scale - before. I've played some of those but for sure it will get me to play what I've never tried and only discover through this series.
Now this I can dig :) looks amazing, anything like this being released will surely do well as the gaming community keeps growing and growing.
Haha 0:59 was so badass and accurate
Why is no one talking about crossfire? Like it's so good 🇵🇭
Warhammer, honor or king and cross fire to join what make me happy
Can’t wait for this
Mega Man fans are eating good TONIGHT
It’s not just a random Space Marine Lieutenant! IT’S LIEUTENANT TITUS ALONG WITH A SQUAD OF BLADEGUARD VETERANS!.
it says stories inspired by my favorite games buuut i don’t see pizza tower 😾
I have... zero expectations here, but it's probably better to do stuff like this than to do full length movie adaptations.
Hell yeah.
First time in a long time a series on prime got me excited.
OMG!!! 00:33 that iii chord is sublime!!! 🤯
I’m jumping on my porcelain throne in excitement like a child after eating the spiciest taco imaginable rn minus the excitement
They deadass could make a fighting game of this
Why the thumbnail using Darth Plageuis scene from The acolyte 🤣🤣
This better be good man.
Bro why is Kratos in a City 🤯
Theyre really hoping this show could revive a dead game. L concord lol
keanu reeeves in armored core is everythingggggggggg ffs!
NEED a Jak and Daxter episode in season 2 😭😭😭
Yes. Yes. And YES!
shut up and take my in-game money !
Imagine the finale being a secret that they're keeping.   And that secret would be Halo
I haven’t been this excited for a show in long while
Brain trying to process.
Astartes tv show. Im in.
Mega man!!!
Mega-Man!
I want to see sifu
This looks SO COOL! Though I’d find it hard to believe that the PAC-MAN story could be better than what TerminalMontage has made.
Boi
SPELUNKY??
Hell yeah
The outer Worlds 2!!!!
Finally something to be hyped for
Goosebumpsssss 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Ok😮 i didnt expect that
Ah yes, my favorite video game, Warhammer 40,000. Created as a video game in 1987 by noted video game studio GamesWorkshop as a video game. Not as anything else.
Thumbnail from The Acolyte?
Is this darty plaguid
Did i see kratos and MegaMan?!
Unreal Tournament ftw!  Long live our wonderful game!
"From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots". Please tell me Halo is involved. if not please get involved.
Concord as one of the episodes haha, well, they can't all be winners, huh?
Like Love Death Robots , but video games!
Mega man se ve GOD y tengo las espectativas en el cielo oara kartos
Hmm did I just see Jill Valentine in there????
is Megaman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 super fighting robots!!!!!!!
MEGA MANNNNN!!!! MEGA MAN IS IN THIS!!!!!
BT!!!!!!!!!!!!
I look forward to the Armored Core one
By the Emperor’s light… did I see an Astartes?
Megaman!
WHO CAME FROM GUZZU??
This actually looks exciting. NGL!
Love Death Robot Vibes
WHERE IS DOOM SLAYER
Holy shit
I am going to love this when it comes out
chills, fucking chills... whoever made this trailer, give them a goddamn raise
I'm reeeeeeeally interested to know WHAT they chose from Unreal Tournament to pull for this series. Imo should've taken from the original Unreal.
wow, what a crazy idea... <3 <3
MEGA MANNN
Can’t wait to see the Mega Man one! He’s finally gonna be back in a spotlight
Sifu is such an underrated masterpiece, glad to see it’s getting some recognition ❤️
what a wonderful time we are living in i am really happy
On my birthday??!?? Everyone’s gonna be PISSED when they find out what we’re doing
Concord 😂😂😂😂
Me hubiese gustado ver un corto de animación de Warframe en esa serie. Esperemos que tengan éxito con este proyecto.
GUYS TF
Hey it's nickmercs the dude with the shirt 😂
WTF CONCORD?
Any company or studio that complains about the success that this is GOING to achieve, has no one to blame but themselves. The fans have asked for years, now someone delivered, and will be known as legends from here out.
Whoever came up with this idea needs a massive raise...
Im not excited for much anymore considering the landscape of the industry and how leftists ruined everything nowadays... but this looks special
I wonder how much Concord payed to join this crowd??
Sifu, GOW, Ghost of Tsushima, armored core. Fav games here
Armoured Core, DnD, Mega Man, God of War, Sifu, Ghost of Tsushima, Pac Man. Lord have mercy because I WILL be watching.
Jesus megaman it's gonna be her🤤
Seeing Space Marines on TV is gunna be so surreal
Gears of war never gets any love
BRB gon a cry
Love death & robots was inexcusable. Just terrible.
Armored core?!?!
Had me sold the moment I saw the Blue Bomber! Love me some Megaman
Peak animation has returned
Honor of Kings and GoW S2
I don’t know if this has any basis in fact, but some of these shots (0:23 in particular) just *scream* AI-generated, or at least AI-assisted/enhanced. I know I shouldn’t expect a megacorp to not cut corners, especially if it means shaving a couple zeroes off their expenditures.
1:17 BLOODBORNE???
Did Amazon just have an actual good idea?.. I swear they must have read one of my comments from ages ago on some other video where I said something that basically amounted to "A studio should make a bunch of short films as a test bed for future shows"..Like, instead of just going all in on something, just make a bunch of little things. A one or two episode series with 8-10 short films each done by multiple stuidios in different ways and actually pay attention to what the public has to say. And if the hype grows enough, THEN you can sink all your cash into a series..This feels like Amazon throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks. And if anything does stick, I wouldn't be shocked to see a full series come of it.
Finally
Lowkey wanted Titanfall 🤣 or Sleeping Dogs they better have Season 2
why is concord there at all really shows the backdoor deals that was made for this "you can have kratos but concord has to come along"
Holy crap, this looks GORGEOUS. I wonder if the episodes will be canonical to their respective franchises 🤔 Not that it matters; I’ll be watching either way
We about to Witness Greatness this December🗿
I was just recently asking where all the 40K (or fantasy for that matter) Warhammer shows and movies were at.  It seems like such a criminally untapped market.  Gaunt's Ghosts, Inquisitor, Horus Heresy... man, there's *so much* material out there that could be used, or they could just make an original story instead.
That wasn’t just Armored Core.   That was Keanu Reeves climbing into his Armored Core!
BLOODBORNE???
One thing I am very curious about is the length of each episode, I really wish there are long
Goddamnit Capcom, we could've had a story rich movie about the unique and creative world of Monster Hunter.
Getting a Captain N vibe from this only 100x better.
Shut up and take my money!!!
This won’t be live action, right?
Unreal tournament ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hope each episode is at least 18 minutes.  Not 5 - and 7-minute episodes
siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Just please do it right this could be a masterpiece in a long line of future episodes!!!! So looking forward to it.
was hoping for outer worlds 2 news out of gamescom this year, didn't expect it to be in a trailer for a show lol. LD&R was great and this looks excellent though, so I'll take it!
40k Mentioned RAAAAHHHHHHH
All i want is anything spelunky
Visionaries indeed...
What is this?
I am happy for armored core, but when they flashed a mech in 0:50-0:51 my Titanfall hope was reignited, for it to just vanish again :(  I wish someone would buy this franchise and put it back together on its feet…
Amazing 🤩
Who have say yes in Amazon ? Eternal love ❤
Don't screw me in the end, I hope it's to see the terrain and then watch individual animated series all animated w40k I'm coming
what is this show even about??
He kratos in 0:50
why didn't you get Kenshi, after the last one? "snow in the desert" haha.
that's hype.
Was there any Assassins Creed reference?
Honor of kings!
This has big potential. As long as they keep trash writers and activists away from it. Some interesting ones there id like to see.
Mi... Mi pantalón...
0:41 Lee??
Am just here for the visuals it looks surreal n cool
Looks like there won't be any Elden ring ;c
Looks insane.
I don't wanna see a edgy pac-man short. I got a bad feeling about this.
Why Concord? Why not the Managed Democracy chads Helldivers?
Please Nintendo, let Metroid and Fzero out to play in season 2.
the only one no one genuinely cares about is concord, but everything else very easily makes up for it
I knew it i saw malcom of unreal tournement
Can't wait to be disappointed
My only question is why Kratos is in a city. This will be interesting
we dont want Rings of Power, we want whatever this is. Yes please
No gameplay No purchase
Holy. Shit.
Unreal Tournament?!!!! Omgggg
I’m confused what this is supposed to be about…all I can gather is that it SEEMS to just be re-telling various games’ stories? I’m probably way off, but the teaser doesn’t really tell me much. Anyone able to elaborate?
Kratos... Jin Sakai.. Sifu... Space marines.. I am so hyped
I'm just here for the WH40K content.
No idea what i just watched but I'm hyped
That Astartes smashing into the truck and absolutely obliterating it is SO awesome
Im here for Kratos and Jin Sakai 🐐 🐐
Syama Pedersen’s Astartes?
Holyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
0:45 Fires of Rubicon?
Looks Cool but prob will be mid
This is absolutely great!
This will be the greatest commercial of all time
I thought I got Rick Rolled at the end
It’s not just a random Space Marine Lieutenant! IT’S LIEUTENANT TITUS ALONG WITH A SQUAD OF BLADEGUARD VETERANS!
Seeing kratos for 2 frames is so much HYPE ALREADY
Is that my heavy breathing I hear or is it someone else's?
HONOR OF KING
This is 🔥
Nobody complaining that its all CG and not practical? Strange...
first time Prime video made something I will watch.
Nothing interesting to see.
WTF ?
godoooooooo
WOW...! So multiple epic proportions...
im so watching...wow
Soy el único que espera ver cómo adaptan spelunky 😅
Gotta be honest I love like almost all of these but I’m mainly here for GOW
Murder PacMan
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
About time...🎯
Sifu deserves at least a 20 min episode, the fight scenes are gonna go crazy!!
Офигенно
I'll watch Armored Core
Finally… For years, we’ve been getting all these awesome CG trailers for video games and everyone’s like... “They should make this into a show.” Well… Looks like we’re getting them. All of them.
Bro, Microsoft/Bethesda and CDPR gotta let these guys do their IP’s as well. Would love to see an Elder Scrolls Episode, Starfield episode, Witcher episode with a new Witcher, or cyberpunk
Pls I just want one episode with Solid snake, PLEASEEE AMAZON PRIME THATS ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS😔🙏🏾
YOOOO IT'S ROCKMAN!!!!!
Mega Man... nuff' said I'm in.
Amazing
If we dont get a episode with doomguy/doomslayer  in it i will actually be so sad. (if there is a second season or more episodes then shown)
Keanu Reeves in an Armored Core 🙏
This is like Ready Player One.   Only good. (Fight me)
ARMORED CORE. I'M IN.
This is gonna be sick yo🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
JIN SAKAI OOOOOOOHHHHHH
WHICH IS SPELUNKY
where's half life reference.
Idk why spelunky is with Pacman, GOW, Megaman and PlayStation but I'm not complaining
That music 🤩 name?
Megaman fans out here starving, FINALLY, SOME FOOD.
OMG...but... why was Concord on this? LOL
WAS THAT TIAMAT? HELL YEAH WE NERDIES ARE EATING GOOOOD
Nobody wanted concord here
cant wait for this, never been more excited for a show until now the creators of LD+R  did such a great job its unbelievable
God of War and Mega Man are the only reasons to watch this
Half these views and likes are just from Kratos lol
Mega Man in 00:58 🎉❤
I was hyoe by the Space Marines... But... TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY AND GIVE ME THAT ARMORED CORE EPISODE!!!
More hot garbage
Absolute Cinema!
This is why Tim Miller should direct the next live-action TMNT reboot  He understands CGI like none other
Excited for this concept of this style of CGI going popular. I believe it has a ton of potential, not necessarily for it being used only to adapt existing IP's but to make new IP's using this format. It really can provide unlimited creative freedom in the same way anime does for example. The scope, scale, possibilities are endless compared to a normal production imo (tho I might be wrong since I'm no filmmaker) even the characters are not limited to what the pool of actors you have, since you can create them from scratch exactly how you envision them. Despite there being multiple attempts (like the Final Fantasy movies, GantzO) I think something with better direction, script and overall quality can provide the push the medium needs for it to be taken seriously other than the incredible cinematics for videogames like The Old Republic or Warcraft. Even it might become a better alternative to adapt anime instead of going full live action 👀
This is sooooooo sick. Way to go Blur!
Holy shit!!!!!! Someone remembers unreal tournament exists
Say no more, I’m in!
Corridor is going to go crazy over this one 😂
FUCKING ARMORED CORREEEEEEE LETS GO BABY
God Damm just when I un subscribe  amazon for charging us extra for the no ads bullshit. I guess
So I can see why the other games are on the list for episodes, but why is Concord on the list? When I'm typing this, it hasn't even come out yet, and I haven't even heard much about it or a lot of people having interest. Is it an advertisement stunt? Or is it just popular and I'm lost with the times?
cant wait for the tau vs armored core episode
would be cool to see a helldivers story in season 2 if this is successful
what
If you think about it, this is a great way for people whose not so familiarise with other game titles get into it using this form of media, really good idea
shoulda been a tf2 episode.
FOR THE EMPEROR!
Is this gonna be like Ready Player One but better?
But why concord?
this looks freakin' awesome
ARMORED COREEEEEE
I’m just frozen at Unreal Tournament.  Oh my god…
Wish they had Plants vs Zombies and the story of Crazy Dave
I was hooked when i read Love, Death and Robots. I am obsessed now that I saw the number of games this will be based on.
Where's Xbox 😭😭
The concord episode is the only chance for the game to have a spike in player. Better be good ! 😂
CONCORD... LOL ROFL LOL .... noob F4G LOL
can we get an alternative of the Last of us 2 please XD
Was that inFAMOUS in there for a few frames???? I freaking hope so!
We have been asking for something made in animation styles for a long time
vanguard overed boost sighted
Seems like a great lineup but I'm stunned that Warcraft isn't one of them.
Mega man..???!!!!!!🤯🤯
vi a ellie de the last of us?
This looks awesome!!
JIN FKING SAKAI ? WAIT WHAT
ARMORED CORE?! WITH KEANU!!! im losing my freaking mind this is gonna be so sick
This will suck
You the show / movie is going to be good when the trailer is well made
Outer worlds!?
You know what. He hasn’t gotten a new game but if it’s mega man I’ll be there
That's crazy to be honest one of the most insane shit ever.
Those are fucking Primaris Astartes fighting Beastmen, and I honestly don't care for the rest of the trailer.
Aka, Amazon had to find some way to make money off the 40k cg they already made.
SIFU!
This looks amazing. The games themselves are not especially my favourites, but the potential is insane.
Looks really cool!
IM BRICKED UP RIGHT NOW! 😂😂😂
That looks absolutely epic. How I love video game culture, even at age 41
Anyone else laugh out loud when pac man opened up his mouth and went vroooom!!!!
WANT
This looks so cool!
Kratos in a CITY is going to hit hard!
You had me at Love + Death & Robots.
Why concord tho 😂 no one plays that game Better do Halo or Crisis
God I hope they are doing a Venger Vs Tiamat story
Uuaaaauu💪🏻
………      *MAN*
Holymoly sifu
Did not know we are getting crismistmas early this year. This is so hype.
Was that Kratos?!
Excited.
The new Wreck it Ralph looks pretty cool
yesssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hope, one day they bring Destiny into this
can't wait their interpretation of Spelunky!
Im creaming hard
Fanservice
Goosebumps! Very Exciting.
Excited
"lets do a test show to check what ppl want more of" -amazon team 2024
The sequel of Ready player one we need and deserve
concord is in there lol
Better have rdr2
Everybody praising every other game but sleeping on the ine that deserves the most love: THE OUTER WORLDS, I’m so happy to see this game be adapted and get its flowers😁🤩❤️
So.... This is basically Amazon's version of the "What If" ?
Looks awesome. Very curious to see what they do with it. I honestly though 0:50 was Cyberpunk 2077 though.
Seems like another ready player one
Its the Super Fighting Robot!
It's game or Animation Film?
I have no clue what is it going to be about from this trailer
UNREAL TOURNAMENT!  IM SOAKING
I wish they could’ve had a gears of war episode
I was sold the moment I saw that first shot of the space marines, but that Tiamat (I think) snippet has me even more excited
All this game... To create ---  The reboot of Kingdom Hearts. Yes, you will open the door.
Yes and Thank You.
Ain't no way they added Crossfire 😭😭😭😭
UJUUUUUUU can’t wait
Have they finally let the Astartes creator outside without the chains ?
From the creative minds behind LOVE, DEATH + ROBOTS, yeah babyyyyy missed them on netflix, no new season
Bro, even if it wasn't about games, anything made by the guys who made Love, Death and Robots would have been on my eatchilist on day 1. Literally watched those antologies like 50 times, last times was like 5 times back to back a few weeks ago.
Amazon's Kingdom Hearts...
Well… okay. I was super excited at a new anthology series. Then I learned it was based on games. A tad less excited but we’ll see
*well well well, Jin Sakai is back 🗿* *_0:51_**_ watch that part 0.25x speed_*
This makes my everything so happy! No code here.
Christmas comes early this year
Wait!!! am I dreaming? HOLY SH*T.  Cant wait to watch these 💖💖💖
Yeah, I think I can take a break from playing & watch this.
Guys. We are going on a new adventure!
Wow
Let's hope they don't mess up the source material, eh?
Secret Level! Through the mountain! Secret Level!
Professional ultramarine hater but he ran through a truck without question so 🤷‍♂️
You new you knew you
Actually can't wait for this!
HELL YEAH
Spelunky!
OKAY,I GOT CHILLS 😍😍😍😍
As an armored core fan for over a decade, seeinf what appears to be Keanu Reeves climb into an AC is just so incredibly validating for me
LIEUTENANT TITUS HELL YEAH
MEGA MAN!!!!!!
In the words of Deadpool "I'm soaking wet right now". This is going to be peak!
Man, how much do I wish they included Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver in that list, or even Metal Gear Solid (with Snake voiced by David Hayter would knock it out of the park).  But for a list of supposedly "favorite games", they included Concord in it? And since they were at it why not include the acclaimed Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League, since it's a "favorite" too???😮‍💨
Oh hell yeah
Get your special sock out nerds! It’s bout to get good!
Let's goooooo!!!
F*kkkk yeaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!
Just make every episode WH40k.
That soundtrack thooooo.
Yessss
C'mon MEGAMAN X9 game !!! I'm 30 please capcom XD
Less rings of power, more of this!
Wow
What kind of Darth Plagueis is that on the thumb?
This looks absolutely AMAZING!
ARMORED CORE AND WARHAMMER?!?!? IM GONNA DIE
nobody cares about concord
This looks amazing! I can't wait!
Concord, really? Out of all the video game universes you could've chosen? Either way, I'm excited for this one.
What the hell Concord doing here? That game will be already shutdown when this series release.
Ehm, so that short song/melody near the end... anyone know what that is?
1:00 - It's just an orgasm
Vai ser épico 🫡
So are we gonna pretend like the thumbnail isnt Darth Plagues fron the acolyte. Same pose. Same weird face. Wtf is going on here?
MAKE UNREAL GREAT AGAIN
Man. Everyone on Facebook is toxic compared to loyal YouTubers. They had all the wrong things to say bout this
Dudes, bring in Mass Effect, please. It is beyond epic already, but Mass Effect would make it LEGENDARY!
Aint no way they got spelunky in this that's amazing
Hope it's at least 30+ minutes per episode
WARHAMMER LESSGOOO
YES!
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED ♨️🥵🤖
I mean I don't know if it's the games they chose or the trailer but I didn't recognize any game at all in the trailer lol
cannot wait for the  magic to be interrupted by a fucking add! Thx Amazon
Ive never been so confused and hayped at the same time
SIFUUUUUUUUUU😭
How can i submit my captain falcon movie?
0:47 W- WEGA MAN?
Now make it a game
621: Raven ?
Before watching this video I had no idea about what it was.  After watching the video I still have no idea about it, but it seems to be interesting 😂
Kratos in a modern day city feels so wrong
Whoever thought of this needs a raise fr
why is kratos in manhattan?
No one is talking about how this is the first time we got an official live action mega man, and they actually remembered that he's a robot designed to look like a little boy
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA UWAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE ME ON, IM SO EXCITED TO SEE MEGA MAN ON THIS SERIES AND SOME OTHER CHARACTERS TOO, EVEN PAC MAN!!!! THIS WILL BE AMAZING, I KNOW IT!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Wow😲
AAAAARRRMORED COOOOREE🗣️🔥🔥🔥  If i dont see anything to do with rusty ibis or 621 imma start a riot tho
Mega Man fans got their yearly drop of water.
It's amazon so probably gay marines and dei everything
oh shit i saw jin from ghost of tsushima. cant wait for that one
Finally 🤟
"Ready Player One" should have been a series like this.
Dude, we're getting an official Astartes level WH40K episode (or basically short movie) and I'm here for it.
Kratos and Jin Sakai 🤩 🔥
THAT WAS A VOB AND MOTHERWILL! IT’S ARMORED CORE FOR ANSWER!
I'm just here for the big robots
No way concord is getting it's own episode
The ones I’m most excited for are god of war, ghost of Tsushima and sifu
I'm here for Darth Plagueis
Ok, finally an interesting production from Prime Video!!!!
All i needed to see was "visionaries from love death robots" and they got me
0:31 0:43 0:51 (OMG THAT'S KEANU!) ARMORED CORE MOMENT🥲
Did I just see the Astartes?  I'm in.
Cool was hoping for a 40k show tho
OMG, please tell me that Syama Pedersen is working on it
I'm so hyped it's unreal
thought it was an ABE'S ODYSSEY movie from the thumbnail 🧐
Hok my favorit❤❤
No Darksouls?
This looks AWESOME
It's animated by adults!
Can't fucking wait
Words cannot describe how excited I am for this
Man, they really didn't expect concord to flop huh?
Man LD+R is a brilliant series of shows and knowing they will be behind this is amazing. When i saw mega man I was like "woooooooooooooooooo" and I know it will be done good.
So, this is a copy paste of Love, Death + Robots.
I secretly hoped for Metroid to appear but we are talking about Nintendo here. This looks amazing anyway and I am hopely for its delivery!
ARMORED CORE AND WARHAMMER  YES YES
Este momento...  Este momento yo lo llamo Felicidad ❤️
MEGAMAN!!!!!
Space Marine takes off helmet, it's Samus DEI.
Ultrasmurfs going hard this year.
MegaMan!? 🤩
i thought the thumbnail was "darth plagueis", the acolyte nightmare is still stuck in my head
Did I just see Megaman 😮
90% of these games are never played by anyone bruh wtf is this
Uh......OMG!!!! (Im 53 btw :))
Praise the Omnisiah!
Prime: "Shows Kratos for 2 frames"  Me and the boys: *"YEAAAHHHHHĤĤĤĤĤ!!!!"*
When you let creative people cook, amazing things can happen. Keep your agendas out of this, and it might just be epic.
WHAT!? Amazing!!+
lol crossfire
Wait Kratos is in a modern city?
AMAZON! Make a good Warhammer 40K serie/movie and My Life is Yours!
I was hyped to see the doom slayer, but slowing the video, it's not him at 0:51
So many bots in the comments lmfao
Hopefully you purify the DEI rules by then. 30% forced DEI right?
>Concord casually mentioned in the same breath as Mega Man, Pac-Man, Kratos, Warhammer 40k LOL
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
This was super helpful, thanks!
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA ❤❤❤❤❤
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
GHOST OF TSUSHIMAAA IS REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
SEASON 2 Halo Doom R6 Valorant apex Red Dead Hollow knight hades Hell divers Half-life Destiny overwatch  show some games that have a cool story sick of these mobile Asian games
"Got a job for you, 621. This one comes from Amazon HQ."
Honor of Kings? Really?
SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT!!!!!~
KRATOS????! 0:49
Hey I thought that was darth Plagueis
Warhammer 40K hell yeah man i cant wait for this.
Omfg! I cannot wait! ❤
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Warhammer :) unreal torn X why? new world X why? God of War :) Outer Worlds :) Honor of kings X why? exodus X spelunky :) yes Crossfire X wtf? concord X WTF??????
THANK YOU AMAZON, THIS IS ALL GAMERS DREAM COME TRUE! LETS GO AHEAD TO THE NEXT ERA!
Considering the graphics, they could easily create the most haunting animated horror anthology with the creepiest/ scariest cinema monsters of our tv history.
CARALHOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Only western IP's as far as i can see. I hope they knock on Hudson, Nihon Falcom, Team Ninja, Tecmo, SNK and the other genius in Japan, before putting together the list.  Ok ok, Meagan maybe, but, yeah, i was already bored.
Oh good Lord that space marine running through a car gives me a stroke nearly every time I watch it.  I need a full series of just that
Why does prime keep constantly cooking up peak shows bro like what is prime plotting
The Emperor protects!
“We want more Megaman and Unreal Tournament games” Capcom and Epic: “I heard the first 7 words. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some IP to go ignore”
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Finally a show to fill the "Love, Death+Robots" shaped hole in my heart 🥺
<yawn>
A pity they chose those games… I play a lot, but I recognized only a few here. I was missing Halo, Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo… more popular games. Still it looks great!
I’m down
I was screaming while watching this. The first shot alone and then I saw "From the Visionaries behind 'Love, Death and Robot'". I am not sure I blinked after that title card.😅
We getting Multi-verse of gaming before we get GTA VI.🗣🗣💯💯
Concord!? Seriously!? At least I know which episode I'm gonna skip.
So many great games not rep’d here cause they’re afraid to spend money
What’s Kratos doing in the city?
This has potential to be the best looking animated show to date at least in the West.
That's wild
new world XD
Warhammer, armored core, sifu, Ghost of tsushima....omfg im hype. My one question is, is that cyberpunk 2077 when they panned over the city? If it is, my hype just grew even more.
I hope the warhammer episode will be made by astartes.🙏
You had me at Space Marine's Hello.
Imagine if halo were in this, untapped potential frl
i spent 8 years waiting for this  -Sifu
Goosebumps everywhere
Pac-Man cameo in the end is a chef kiss
i love everything that has tim millers name on it
this looks absolutely incredible! This used to be the kind of content that Netflix produced, but Prime is now carrying that flag. Cannot wait for December!!
I'll watch them all but I have the feeling it will be like Animatrix, Star Wars Visions, Modest Heroes, and other collections of animated stories where one or two will be great, and the rest will be kind of disappointing.
Невероятно красиво выглядит
We want this in 3D in theatres
That was insane dude 🔥🔥🔥 waiting
There’s so much to unpack here. I’m so excited for actual animated pieces of my favourite games - especially Outer Worlds. I’m really excited how they expand on that corporate dystopian world.
I never thought Pac-Man would be in an R rated series.
It feels like AI generated
Last scene and "you have game to Play" :D they win :)
Everyone is hyping on Kratos and Jin and the like being in this. Im just happy to see my boy Mega Man in it! 😊
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD♥
Awesome
LMAO Concord. What a joke.
❤❤❤
Where is the Borderlands franchise 😢😢
my body is ready!!!
Nobody ask :  Prime video : YES
Oh snap!!
I think amazon will make live action series on all this games... Coz they are making one on warhammer😌.. So what do you think?
UNREAL TOURNAMENT LETS GOOOOOOO
Wow more Concord shorts? Move aside Space Marines, we all know what short we’ll be talking about when the show drops
We need a new game like Kingdom Hearts but with these characters.
People from love death and robot, but it's not on Netflix?
Can't wait for more Spelunked!
what the f$_cing f$+&k
Yes x20 + LDR. Sign me up and take my money
Why is the prime logo stretched up 1:29 ?
I guess I won’t end it all if I know they’ll release something like this every few years.
This is sick 🔥
Concord💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Aaaaaaaaa!!!❤❤❤❤
Plz don't F this up!
Megaman?! LET'S F*CKING GOOOOO
Holy... whoever pitched this idea deserves a crown. December just got really exciting.
PlayStation games… please daddy Bezos give us an uncharted episode I beg of you
Im gonna play all these games again. Except sifu.       Dont think ill be able to complete that even at old age.
OM FKNG GODDDDD😮😮😮😮😮 *Buys a cryo capsule*
"The most beloved video games". Ah yes, "Playstation", that well known game series. And really? New World Aeterum (a game that isn't even out yet), Exodus, Crossfire and Concord? I think we're reaching a bit to claim any of these titles are "Beloved".
Please, please, please! Give me Dark Souls Inspired episode in there.
Goosebump
So is this a game of crossover or ps game
where is unreal tournament? i dont see
Me emociona que al fin incluyan a Kratos en una serie pero qué carajos hace en una ciudad con edificios? Pensé que iban a mostrar como vivía con atreus
Imagine helldivers👀
Ghost of Tshushima vs the Ghost of Sparta😂( only real fans)
Did I see Concord listed on there? How did that turd make it into the lineup?
Already started playing the video, and the first thing I saw was Space Marines slaughtering Tzeench daemons.  10/10 PERFECT INTRODUCTION.
Imagine if there was an alternate reality with a Half Life or Portal episode
from the people who did love death and robots? im all in
Holy fck .....the hype is real
I loved (love death + robots) and I'm gonna fall in love with this even more, can't wait
prime is cooking
Wow omg 💀
GOT A JOB FOR YOU 651
Fuckin SIFU. I’m in
Please please please be good warhammer we need a series of that alone.
Outer Worlds 2 mentioned
what franchise gets burned next?
Peak!!!!
Season 2 - WoW,  Frostpunk, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk, The Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, Red Dead Redemption 2, Tomb Raider, Outer Wilds, Mass Effect, Inside, Crash Bandicoot,  Half Life...
I feel like I'm most excited for space marines and Tiamat from DnD
Obrigado, mãe de todos os streamer
Looking forward to this!!
DECEMBER 10TH, THAT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
0:54 Is this Keanu Reeves!? Please tell me is cyberounk 2077!!
why no League? they literally have the best lore
After this, I might have to watch Love, Death, and Robots.
For the Emperor! Honor of Kings is there!
ITS A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!
Hahaha no thanks
YEEEEEEAH, FUCKING YEAHHHHH
Oh this gave me such goosebumps I still feel it minutes later! Super excited! Finally animated movies doing justice to games! AND UNREAL TOURNAMENT! LET'S GOOOOO!!!! You have been forgotten for far too long!
Dude...
BRO MEGAMAN 🗣️‼️‼️
I actually got goosebumps 😮
Makes feel like I'm 12 again. Thank you 😊
Unreal tournament??? Yes please!!
Did I see armored core and 40k!?Yessssss finally!
I've never heard of armoured core but the amount of love its getting here has me interested...
I already need a season 2🔥🔥
Its not even out yet and I want more of this! This is such a sick idea!!!!
game selection is weird, still excited
Hype is unimaginable just wow
This might be the most personally exciting trailer I've seen in a long time.
Looks inedible 👏🏻
Beloved games yet multiple haven't released yet? Still cool, but clearly an ad.
Badass!
Help, I Cant Stop Watch it
0:52 KEANU FUCKING REEVES!!! WTF!!! MY HYPE LEVELS💹💹💹
Horizon zero dawn would be perfect for this
0:23 Is this Exo from Destiny?
Cool, vut this better not be the Henry cavil warhammer project
YOOO GUYS ITS TIME TO ARMOUR THID CORE
Mighty warhammer.🎉
why exactly the games that people care about the least  and really? concord?
If it's of our favourite games why is Concord there?
OMG
If this doesn't convince Capcom to make Megaman, I dunno what will.   DO IT!
Where's Capcom and Konami?
Amazon's got a job for you, 621.
Warhammer will be awesome
Ini tuh apaan ? Film kah? Bakal seperti apa yah film nya menggabungkan banyak game seperti itu😮
Am I nuts, or am I seeing a Korriban native Sith in this?
I thought this was amazing, but I wanted to give some game suggestions for a second season:  Starfox Bomberman Castlevania Metal Gear Crash Bandicoot Prey Hollow Knight Undertale Cave Story Darksiders Prototype Infamous Bayonetta Okami Just Cause Shadow of The Colossus Dark Souls Bloodborne Doom System Shock Metro (series)  and more
How are they using Darth Plagueis?
The Zelda movie adaptation should have been made by those guys...
Ah yes, my favorite video game series, Warhammer 40k. This is like when people tried to argue that Goku should be added to Smash Bros.
I can’t wait to see what the rest of megaman looks like!!
40K!?!?!?!? HYDRA DOMINATUS!!!
Can anybody type the full list of pop culture IPs they show in the end?
Can't wait for Pac-Man's appearance
I’m SO EXCITED
wow it's cool
Man this show looks amazing! Such a great idea to make it, Tim Miller and the team put so much passion into it, Armored Core, God of War, Unreal Tournamet, Sifu, Ghost of Tsushima, the list goes on, there is nearly limitless storytelling potential, so excited to explore all these worlds, it’s going to be good! 😊
Amazon please Warhammer 40K ....new worlds new stories new heroes warhammer 40k has everything and in abundance
I did NOT expect Spelunky to be here!!
I hope. This series does well. I would love to see their style for a Gears of War story or even a Mass Effect story.
Why Concord though? Lmao everything about this looks amazing but Concord is a weird choice
Some nice reveals here but they all pale in significance to Abby from The Last of Us 2, a revolutionary character that does not get the respect she deserves
Ahh so this is what Syama Pedersen has been working on.
Wow 🥰
Why is nobody talking about spelunky? That shit has me SO hyped
I'm gonna fucking nerdgasm.
I member!
This is an absolutely incredible idea. I never thought I'd want to watch a tv show so bad until this existed. Death, Love, and Robots was really incredible so I can't wait to see how this turns out!
This looks very interesting!! I mean they are doing warhammer and armored core!! Sifu looks like it's going to be great, and they are doing mega-man.
We need one for Crysis as well
After the way Epic mistreated Unreal Tournament im ecstatic to see some new appreciation for it. I will be watching this.
Praise the Emperor!!!!!!
I saw SIFU in the trailer. Not going to lie I'm surprised that game is getting attention. I mean I love it so much but I'm still surprised.
All I want is a Destiny anthology series, a mix of the clone wars and Love Death and Robots would be awesome!!!
this pains me, but compared to love, death + robots this looks... generic.
Time to fly Ravens, we have ours!
TELL ME THAT'S ASTARTES 2 WITHOUT TELLING ME THAT'S ASTARTES 2!!!
I don't know what the f*** is going on in this, all i care is that i will get an Armored Core episode. Hell yeah.
But where is Skyrim? (with mods preferably)
Holy shit! Epic Games remembered tht Unreal Tournament exists?!?
1:16 did i just saw the Bloodborne Hunter? am i trippin? also, almost screamed here in the office when i saw Megaman
I would have preferred a "Mega Man X" episode but I'll take the "Mega Man."
Crap
why is darth plaugis here
When competent people make art.
No Ratchet? (
This is gonna be peak chat
Concord having a movie made about it ? Lol
God of warrrrrrrrrrr🎉🎉🎉🎉
The choice of games seem so random lol but it's an interesting idea. If the creators of Love Death Robost are in, it's already a good sign.
Sifu 😮😮😮😮
I have always dreamt of a movie or a tv show made using the visuals of a game's cinematic trailer and now, here we are 😭
I excited for this!
which is the game at 0:26 ?
The opening sound to this is definitely that pornhub clip...
MEGA FREAKING MAN....the blue bomber is WAAAAYYYYY overdue. Capcom has dropped the ball with one of their flagship IPs.
Finally, a propa scrap Boyz.
Sold!
Awesome trailer. Gamers will love it!
I'm sold - just please don't sprinkle in political messaging
Amazon prime.... hats off❤
New Sifu content Let's GO!!!
SIFU!!!  Such a GREAT game!!!!  This series looks incredible!
Where is Kirby?😂😂😂
Keanu Reeves piloting an Armored Core is not on my 2024 checklist and i'm here for it. I am so hyped!
all hyped until i saw the word "Anthology." F**k that. I'm out.
Amazon you crazy mad bastards! I'm completely on board for this.
Why is Darth Plagues on the thumbnail?
I'M VERY SURPRISED THAT GAMES WORKSHOP ALLOW AMAZON TO MAKE WH40K SINCE THEY LIKE TO BLOCK AND SUING MANY ARTISTS FOR DOING FAN MADE WH40K STUFF.......
Clever to have actual loved IPs that people care about and then throw slop like Concord.
Amazon showing how much money they have without telling.
Holy shit Tiamat
look like a banger
Surprised they didn’t show more Kratos  Probably in a second trailer.
Can’t tell if I’m more exited for the armored core episode. Or the warhammer episode
Just rewatched Astartes in YouTube and oh boy proud that it’s becoming the norm for making space marine related content
Nice
Bruh what is sifu doing there
this is one of the most beautiful trailers ever created
Did they somehow pick into my mind choose the exact big franchises that I haven't touched?
Oh yeah, i love these type pf shows, cause every story is usually unique and out of the box, and most are pretty good
Sifu AND Armored Core? with a little bit of Warhammer?  I think I'm sold
Made by prime? 😂 that's a no From me.
I My God Is Megaman Bro
Terminator is back from the dead. Prime Video never disappoints. Sure, Netflix is better, but you've got to strap yourself in and watching yourself salivate as one of the robots start feeding you with their gasoline supply from the gas station located somewhere deep into the Amazon Rainforest and where there's little to no chances of surviving climate change and noise pollution.
Thiss is.... what PEAKKKKKKKKKKKKKK IS!!!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I can’t wait but these anthology series always just make me want a full show of every episode!
11 December is my birthday
SIFU?!?!?!  Time to learn Wu De
Unreal Tournament is back !
Im a simple man, im just here for Warhammer...
its weird that i have no idea what half of the titles are
Hope hype doesn't stop the train
gotta stay alive till december by all means necessary
Cool
Me: This is gonna be epic.  Jeff Bezos: Okay which game franchises in these short episodes are gonna have more watch views so I can buy the IP and do live action shows about it like Rings of Power and since I'm having trouble doing that Warhammer show, I'd still have future ip milking options here.
Warhammer fans, assemble.
If they could touch AC maybe... In some blessed time we could get a Bloodborne animation?
Keanu Reeves 🙀
Transformers fall of cybertron pretty pls !!!!!!!!
I like that one!
👍👍
WT* is this? Im sohoooo IN!
Amazon take my money right now
Oh Prime is finally stepping upp
YES!!!
Alright,  gonna hold on to $AMZN till December.
All you had to say was love death and robots and I was sold
SIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!
0:48 Kratos for a split second
I swear I saw kratos
Keanu Reeves with Mohawk and tattoos
621, bust it down. PEAK just dropped"
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED Actually kinda hyped now. First time I've seen and heard of this.
This is fucking insane
0:58 MEGA MAN LOOKS SO BADASS!!!
Is this like MCU's What If? Like you have different episode per each game and then everyone comes together?
BRING IT ON
UNREAL TOURNAMENT LETSSSFUCKINNNNGOOOOOOOO 🙏🙏🙏🔥
I hate you why kratos only show in only 1 milliseconds frame
UNREAL TOURNAMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PLEASE BE F@CKING GOOD PLEASE BE F@CKING GOOD PLEASE BE F@CKING GOOD PLEASE BE F@CKING GOOD
Keanue Reeves? In an armored core?  "Wake the f*ck up Raven. We got coral to burn"
I hope this game is good
This is similar like cyberpunk
Animação de DnD?
Kratos, Sifu, Space Marines, Jin Sakai, Pacman, and Raven (Armored Core)
SPELUNKY LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!11!!!!1
GTA and RDR please
Another money waste on shit game called Concord eh ?
peak cinema
ARMORED CORE
Please do Arthas next season.
Wow 10 december is also my birthday
I hope it's ALL serious and gritty, then the last episode is like, Parappa the Rapper inspired.
Armored Core !!!!!!!
I THINK I CAME A LITTLE
they really put concord in here xD
❤💀🤖 x 🎮👾❤
Who is 0:53? Is that from cyberpunk 2077
Wow, these guys will break the cinema industries
Needed a ghost episode too 😅😅😅
Is that an Astartes?! YES PLEASE
To everyone who has ever watched a cinematic trailer for a video game, and said to themselves, “this would make an awesome movie/TV show…”   … well, as Samuel L. Jackson said in that dinosaur movie, “… hold on to your butts!” 👾😎👍
Does this mean we aren't getting another serason of love death & robots?
1:15 so we see kratos but you dont mention god of war?
How long will each anthology be?
My King would be Honored
crazy, hyped!!!!
Spelunky?? FIRE BUT WTF IS SPELUNKY DOING THERE
Not gonna play Concord. Stop trying SONY!!! 🤣
Can someone tell me the name of the ending music
Ghost of tushima on 0:51 wow
Netflix subs in December 📉
Netflix subs in December 📉
Is that fing mega man!!!
love death robots was mid tho
Ok Amazon, now, bring the animated Mass Effect series we've been waiting for
"From the visionaries behind Love, Death, + Robots."    Me: I'm in.
Titus made my niples hard. Fitting name that. Also, the psyker looked too much like Keanu Reeves.
Unreal Tournament gets a shout? Glad someone remembers the Unreal games cos Epic sure as hell don't
i guess netflix basically lost their right to making more of these, and now its prime time. 😂 tell me im lying.
Unreal Tournament 🖤
would love to see the part of Ghost of Tsushima, we will learn about poetry
Halo Legends did it first.
聖誕禮物!
Spelunky??
Warhammer movie finally coming!!??!???!??!!???!? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am begging you, do not mess this up!!
I need this anthology to have more seasons with even more games
Imagine this overtakws Star wars
The visuals 💯💯💯
SİKİM KALKTI
Space marineeesssasss
Whats this love death and robot
Coooooool! Now we have to wrap our Unreal Tournament trailer before this comes out 😅😂 Looks awesome! 🎉
What's Kratos doing in New York, he tryna visit Spiderman
0:49 GOD OF WAR LETS GO
Is there a reason all 15 episodes aren’t about 40k?
so its gonna be like that star wars anime where different stories with different visual or animation. okok, i like this, very interesting.
This looks incredible. Can’t wait
Closest we're ever going to get to a Mega Man and Pac Man movie adaptations. Hope that we get a second season that features more iconic games like Street Fighter, Tekken and anything Nintendo
Do cyberpunk in season 2
Reject eastern anime bs, embrace western animation culture
No Halo/Master Chief is kinda crazy
Was hat das jetzt mit Warhammer zu tun?
Augmented human, 621, entering hype mode.
For the emperor
The thumbnail reminds me of Darth Plagueis from Star Wars The Acolyte.

I was hoping for an Ace Combat episode as a sort of lead-in to the next installment in the franchise. But I'll take both Armored Core and Mega Man any day.  Maybe Ace Combat will be included in a Season Two, perhaps?
I just saw Kratos !!
This looks interesting
Armored Core?!!!!! Why not Dark Souls? Why AC? I'm not against it, I just don't understand the choice. FS have big plans for the series?
I hope its not wreck it ralph
Everyone is like “How did this happen legally?” I’m like “This show will boost the sales of all these games.”
To top Astartes is not gonna be easy
Interesting. Could be really good. Definitely tuning in
When it mentioned favourite games I was expecting Red dead, the witcher, bloodborne.   Whoever tells you The Outer Worlds 2 is their favourite game is a liar because its not even out yet. It'll probably be good but nobodys even played it yet.  As for Concord, that was an epic failure in a worn out genre, nobodys playing that.
So it's mostly Western pseudo photorealistic dude-bro sausagefest extravaganza anthology type of thing? Meh, couldn't care less about it then.
Hmmm, it has 'Ready Player One' vibes and that is not really a good thing. We'll see how this turns out.
we found plagueis behind his rock
Kratos!
"Inspired by your favourite games"  *turns around looks to see who the hell actually likes Concord" 😂
Definitely gonna watch this since I love LD+R.
Concord ?🤔
for some reason i love cgi movies and series more than live action
Unreal tournament holy shit
0:50 Kratos in a modern world, I’m so excited
Waait .. what happend right now? AND why Prime logo at the end of the trailer? And wtf is Secret Level 😫im having a blond moment here HELP
THE LICENSING NIGHTMARE TO ACQUIRE ALL THESE IPS' PERMISSIONS! That alone is worth it!
NIce pacman cameo ))
For others, this is big (assuming Amazon doesn't do its usual bullshit, cough cough Warhammer and Lord of the Rings/Rings of Power).  But if this is actually a good thing… then this will be the first trip into animation Armored Core has gone.  This will be massive.  Ravens… I don't wanna hold my breath. Buckle up and be ready. Either we go guns blazing… or we fly high.
Kratos ? Rounded by buldings ? Wtf is that ?
ARMORED CORE GANG STAY WINNING
Wait, is that bloody Armored Core 4/For Answer?  I'd recognise that VOB, Vanguard Overed Boost unit anywhere.
We are proud to be part of this amazing series! ❤‍🔥
Finally some megaman
😯 I am soooo excited for this omg!!!!!
1:02 where is that fighter jet from?
😂😂😂 Concord isn’t anyone’s favorite video game. 😂😂😂 That game was dead on arrival
Welp, I am now fully erect.
Gente, algum querido pra fazer uma lista de todos os jogos que apareceram?  Guys, anyone kind enough to make a list of all the games that appeared
Hype hype hype🔥🔥
It's not even out, yet - why are you claiming it's "revolutionary"?! And why couldn't this just be WH40K: The Series?! Nice lead-in with what everyone's been waiting for - please, just let Henry Cavill make WH40K content, no dei, none of The Message.
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT IS SECRET LEVEL?? I want to see kratos
love it! cant wait! hoping a tad longer episodes tho - a bloodborne story will be cool
"From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots"   WAIT WHAT
An opportunity to give praise to great characters, and redemption arcs to those who deserve them.
CINEMA ABSOLUTE CINEMA.
The idea is siiick I'm in
Used to pray for times like this 😭
This looks awesome but I have a question. Why does Warhammer plus exist if your going to put shows on Amazon? When this comes out I'll be watching from my trusty sites that ain't Amazon because f*ck paying for a subscription service that forces ads.
Kratos vs. Space Marines😂
I'm looking forward to it all, particularly the 40K... but holy shit, the fact that there's a NEXT overboosting towards the wreck of the motherfucking Spirit of Motherwill has got me next level hyped. Not only for a potentially amazing series, but also because maybe, just *maybe* older AC games will make it out of publisher hell and get remakes/remasters. It'd be nice not to have to dust off my 360 every time I feel like jumping back into 4A or 5.
ARMORED CORE AND 40K LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Armored Core!!!
got goosebumps from this
ARMORED CORE FKIIIIIIIIIIN YEAH
no league of legends and valorant 😔
here comes the god of fking war... Amazon cooks when it comes to telivision..🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Armored Core ..... 🥰😱🔥
I thought it was the Outer Wilds for a moment and I got so happy and then so disappointed
Let the creator of this cook more
Hoor of Kings gets recognition yes!
Kratos and Jin are there now I just need arthur morgan and John marston. Then this will be complete
0:26 YIXINGG OMGG😍
Glad to know someone cares about UT, because Epic sure as shit doesn't.
"From the visionaries behind Love, Death, Robots". Me: I can't wait. "15 stories inspired by your favourite games" Me: I can't wait until December. PRIME RELEASE IT RIGHT NOW.
Who saw kritus
Oh my )))
It feels like the space marines are animated by the guy that made Astardes, I really hope so, that shit is crazy good
Please in hindi dubbed
I wonder if the Space Marine episode will be the first of Henry Cavill's Warhammer projects
Omg
Start the game
Space marines doing Space marines things. I need  nothing else to be hyped
Holy….. 🤯
SPELUNKY!? ADULT ANIMATED SPELUNKY BY LOVE DEATH ROBOTS PPL?
SPELUNKY!!!
I love how there is 0 xbox games in here 😢
i know it could not be But it looks like Guts 1:01
They got Sweeney to agree to let em use Unreal Tournament?!  Holyshit I'm stoked, I thought my favorite game franchise woulda been dead for good after Epic shut it down and removed it from all stores (still a bonehead move), there's hope after all.
too bad didn't have battletech in it !
Finally, a series about Fortnite
*favorite games....  Includes concord. which failed before it was even released.  Also: should have included roller-coaster-tycoon
It lists all 15 games in the description but instead of God of War it says "various PlayStation Studios games" are we getting a PlayStation Allstars episode?
They really snuck in concord ain’t nobody playing this trash
Titus !
only about 3 games are really known, the rest are pure niche
We upppp 🔥
UNREAL TOURNAMENT they remember
Armored Core!? 😍
Yes Honor of kings
Okay, im excited but kinda dissatisfied that warhammer and armored core probably wont be expanded upon outside of this, love death robots all of the episodes could be an entire movie or series and im sure all of this would be amazing series’s as well, i would kill for a dedicated armored core show that would be insane and could develop lore and bridge the gaps between the older games and the newest one,
This is actually a really cool concept. No shitty, low budget Live Action or even poorly Animated adaptation. It's like you're watching a in-game cutscene.
CROSSFIRE???
The Sifu one looks sick Icl
Concord?😂😂
OMG !!!!!!!!!!!
Kratos in a modern day city????
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Holy shit i don't even care about any of the games mentioned but I'm hyped
What an absolutely FANTASTIC idea. I'm really looking forward to this. Thank you Amazon ❤
I’m excitement
uhh this looks awesome
Oh my fuckin-, i'm pretty interested
Ahhh yes, can't wait for season 2 warzone episode where players fight against 1 hacker.
gniot, powtórki, nuda nic oryginalnego i tyle. le można oglądać te efekciki generowane, bez polotu
0:52 is that Keanu? 🎉
"From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots". say no more, I'm out
尼玛王者还有cf是干嘛的
Can't wait !
It's Beautiful
UNREAL TOURNAMENT!
The is alot of illuminati logos in these trailers 0:52.
0:59 I.... I've missed you so much my Blue bomber friend 🥲
"The chosen...", "..just for you.." and then the game breaks and he suddenly returns to be an slot dork in his stinky room of 3mx3m while outside people starve crushed by capitalism. I like the idea but I hope the series is self aware.
i am tired wait new season love death and robot i hoped this could cure it
Peak core
RAAAAAHHHHHHH
Thumbnail looks like Darth Plagueis, spying from the cave😂😂😂
Drat, no  Doom
🪽🪽🪽🪽
I swear that's Keanu Reeves' at 0:52. Cyberpunk, maybe?
For the Emperor!
even crossfire made it here omg the hype
Chill! Literal Chill
0:47 Mega man?
Anyone else getting ready player one vibes
If the episodes go well, maybe a full dedicated IP season in the future? “the Emperor protects!”
i kinda wanna see one of the metro games in this.
Let's go more armored core
"Awful Film Adaptations of Video Games: The Series"
Yes.
❤❤❤
THE DREAM PROJECT!!!
LFG 🔥💯
Some episodes, unless they are actually good unlike the games in question, like Concord one does not excite me but oh boy so much possibly good stuff is coming!
I cannot wait this looks incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the try to sneak concord in these series
Nuclear Armageddon can wait a few years. Armored Core comes first 🥇😈.
Interesting! Not expecting much but seems cool.
Why does the thumbnail look like Darth Plagueis?
Looks Dope...I was so pissed when LDR was cancelled...nice to have this to make up for it.
Goosebumps, literal goosebumps
SPÀAACEEEE MARRRIEEENEEHH
I swear if it gets canceled after 1 season I will flip my shit
What can I say😂
Holy shit it's Tiamat!
I’ve been saying for years that if they made video game cinematic trailers into an actual series or movie it would be so good
Death love + robots is a masterpiece, can't wait to see what they gonna do with so many IPs
can you tell me if this is just an animated film or a preview of future games? For example, crossfire, will there be an announcement of a new part of the game? or is it just an animated film?
Wth is this...
Uwe Boll should have been on the team💀
alright this has to be the most hyped I've ever been from a trailer, SO much goodies in there
It’s not that fire
spelunky 😸
If only Dishonored became a series
Space Marines! I’m in!
We have Ready Player One at home:
Wowowo
There doing same thing then Ready player one
BLUR studio behind the graphics I guess? The quality is insane!
Lets go exodus !!🎉
0:53 I am not trippin right? That keanu?
MY GOD CONCORD HELL YEAH
Is that warhammer animation by the same guy who made Astartes?
Wtf is kratos in a city though?
gorgeous
Kratos being in a modern city is crazy to see
We are literally getting Spelunky and Crossfire in the same show as Warhammer, Sifu and Armored Core, with also Mega Man, Kratos, Pac-Man, Jin Sakai and Tiamat in it too. This is going to be the greatest fever dream in history and I'm all for it
warhammer +1
this is gonna be AMAZING
MORE!!!
Awesome, this looks very promising in terms of quality and quantity since it'll be like 15 episodes.  That being said, it's ironic that the Mega Man and Unreal Tournament fans are getting anything but new games of those IP's, I really do not understand why Capcom is not doing a new game considering they're having a good streak with their current releases, Epic on the other hand has a clear problem (F$ck you Tim Sweeney).
This is a great idea and it looks amazing so far. I didn't know that I wanted something like this, but now I really want to see it.
I wonder why there's no Master Chief and Doom Guy.
すっげーーー！！！ 最高(((o(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)o)))🎉🎉🎉
trying to sneak in concord xD
This is gonna be epic and i love the animation style
Bruh, I really thought there's a Tau in the thumbnail
Was expecting Starcraft to be there but hyped for this. So the commandos/SF troops in the video was a nod to CS or perhaps COD? 😂
Is that Mega-Man a man or a woman? Looks confusing right? I hope they don´t do anything weird
Warhammer, MegaMan, Sifu... and theres fcking Concord. DOA game with 20 players -.-' how much money sony will spent on that shovelware before rising prices again to get some back?
I like the idea, I like the video... but could you please get some natural music instead of «Action_Trailer_Epic_Music»?
LD+R is my all-time favourite anthology series along with black mirror.. It's look so promising.. I'm in!! Now I just want a new season of LD+R.. C'mon Netflix!!
This looks stunning!
GHOST OF TSUSHIMAAAA
Amazon is winning with this one...too back netflix threw it out
SIFU!
Tf is that thing 0:55
New World = Disapointed
I'm so hype but WHY Concord ? Who care about this ?
holy shit kratos from god of war and doom, holy shit i am in
why concord? having thousands of excellent games to choose from, you give a short film to a game that is not even out yet and that people still hate. At least we'll have something about warhammer to look at, right?
ITS NOT A NEW GAME BUT ILL TAKE IT (hopefully its done right)
Would love to see a Half Life short by blur
top!
FOR THE EMPEROR
This is them saying we will totally look after your franchises, before they mutilate it all and turn everything into the prozak buttered toast of animal crossing and expect you to pay premium for diabetic dog diarrhoea that has been filtered through a macdonalds sauce machine with sweetener and not sugar but told you it has a sugar tax on it and Jamie Oliver says its now OK for kids....
The opening looks like Astartes
Love the charge at 0:59
LOVE DEATH ROBOT MY GOAT
Plagueis?
Izanagi and Riordan Dynamics? Unreal Tournament?? CTF - Facing Worlds style arena??? Sign me the hell up!
Ale to będzie dobre 😀
0:49 Kratos
Incredibly random that Spelunky is included in this but HELL FUCKIN YEAH. DESERVED!
I value any platform that values true craftsmanship. I will subscribe to Prime when this comes out.
見せてもらいましょう アマプラの翼で どこまで飛べるか
i see why that guy got so emotional, they clearly put some insane work and passion into this!
A new idea for a show...is this 2012  again?
You have to give support to Megaman, that is a saga with all of the law!
No Deus Ex? Laaaaaaaame
Either this is gonna be another “halo” fail or a masterpiece
Wtf is this lol
i see "MegaMan", "Pac-Man", "D&D", "Concord", and various Playstation titles!
Let's f***** goo! 🤩❤️‍🔥💥
Can we appreciate the “unreal tournament” logo ?? They might finally revive the franchise if the episode hs good numbers ?
The fact we get to see Space Marines in live action by the creators of LDR, BEFORE Games Workshop's adaptation is kinda infuriating but also gives hope this series will do justice to Astartes.
Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude I'm sold! "SECRET LEVEL is a new adult-animated anthology series featuring original stories set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games. From the creative minds behind LOVE, DEATH + ROBOTS, each of the 15 episodes is a celebration of games and gamers. Games that inspired the 15 epic stories include Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons & Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, various PlayStation Studios games, Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer 40,000. SECRET LEVEL, arrives on Prime Video December 10."
IS THAT FUCKING PAC-MAN
CROSSFIRE?????? WTF?
0:49 bro what the f.. 🔥🔥🔥
Adapt video games and stay true to the source material? What kind of witchcraft is this?!
Thats awesome 😮
Not going to lie, watching this made my junk jump a little from excitement
Swat teams, dragons and samurais. Couldn't look more generic.
Whoever came up with this idea needs a massive raise...
I am so surprised, can't believe CrossFire will appear, i used to play rival factions and it's been a while since the last time i played it, but one of my desires was CrossFire to have a release for consoles. I just hope this will help.
KEANU REEVES ENTERING A MECHA 0:33 😎😎😎
You had me at Love Death aand Robots
Hol-Leee-Sheeet - Warhammer 40K is going to be BIG 🚀
If Prime Gaming came out with a service comparable to XBox Game Pass, with Sony games at the same time this airs, that'd be genius.
1:19 Смута :DDDDDD
It seems like I'm getting Amazon Prime this December
kind of tired of being "the chosen one" everywhere.....   why can't my character be just a worker somewhere that 'gets caught up in' something, and has to 'push themselves' and maybe 'learn new things' to overcome some kind of 'overwhelming odds'...?   fantastic series it seems though, getting excited for it! +++
ARMORED CORE?!?!
SPELUNKY????
Swear I thought I saw Cyberpunk 2077 / Keanu Reeves in that...
I only came here to see if they show off pacman, I almost gave up. Intrigued.
and yet, no one have an idea to brought up the Mass Effect to the big screen ? Come on Prime, uppen ur game by doing so... U know Mass Effect universe is massive, if u make it to series or movie, there will be billions of audience
Amazon? So it’s gonna be full of judeomarxist cancer
This will be my favorite show. I hope they don't flop this idea is amazing
Looking forward to the Warhammer 40k episode.
So nice, Love Death & Robots was already the best thing on Netflix
Dope
Outer Worlds 2????
Armoured Core mentioned les fucking gooooooooo
I have No idea what this about but you had me and everyone else at "Love Death + Robots"
ARMORED CORE YEAH!!!
So do I need to know about all those games to watch this show?
puttanata
About time something like this came out. So hyped
Warhammer and Armored Core!?
Amazon has been on a winning streak lately
Well, this is an automatic must watch
wtf kratos is standing in a modern day city?
Unreal Tournament getting some of the love it deserves.
My hopes are unbelievably high, please don't let us down!
oooh ok...!!! u have my attention
OHHHH ARMORED CORE!!!!
SPELUNKY of all things? Now that's something I never imagined, but I'm all for it
Is that Johnny Silverhand?!?!? 0:50
0:49 is that kratos in modern day?
I am here for Unreal Tournament and nothing else. How the hell did they even get Epic to acknowledge that the game exists anymore?
Unreal Tournament !?!? I waited for something like this for over 20 years
ASTARTES
Megaman is here I’m so hyped
Crossfire ❤
Aw Jesus it gets worst for GW now bought by Amazon whoever is the top there really fucked up
After I watched this trailer I cried
I have a feeling that after watching this series, I'll end up with 15 more games in my library.
I can't wait for this!!! Its looks Epic!! I will definitely watch this series !!!
Cool, but anthology? Eeeh. I cant take these disjointed and fragmented "focus group demo's" seriously. By the time i care about the characters the episode is over and i never see them again. So, why bother. Either make these into actual movies or each a mini-series so we have time to enjoy the characters and the stories. It's like a whole plate of appetizers, which is great but that is not a meal.
Заради цього я не буду підписуватись на амазон прайм, але якщо буде серіал з Генрі Кавілом, без зміни канону, я в ділі
Ong this looks freaking amazing  Kratos, sifu,, ghost if Tsunami , armoured core the list goes on..... I cant....
ACが出るのはすごく楽しみだ… 期待が高まるよ
"It's not just a Game anymore..."
This could be one of the greatest shows ever made if done well. Please don't ruin it. Don't reinvent the wheel just give us more of what we already love.
Pac man 🤩😂
Just goad Honor of kings in it, i love HOK lore story 🥰
BRO THEY COOKED A WHOLE BUFFET
Wow, most beloved video games and Concord in the same paragraph.
0:50 Kratos!!!!
where is Titanfall? still, the project looks good.
Oh my fucking god I got goosebumps let's gooo
ARMORED CORE YEEEAAAHHH
voice actors are gonna make or break this
Why TF is concord in this , sneak game is insane
So excited for this series!!!!
Let’s fucking go
I'll be there for 40k, Armored Core, Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, and Mega Man at least. Ain't no one there for Concord lmfao.
By the Emperor
Could not possibly be more hyped. Finally a proper 40k animation. Wonder if Syama Pederson of Astartes fame is on the animation team? Can't wait for all these. Do a season 2 with more and different IPs! I vote for Cyberpunk 2077 and ofc more 40k!
something like I have been waiting for my whole life
got a feeling of animated female space marine
Is this what they got the Astartes guy to work on? Kinda looks it
hey i work for you, gimme prime for free pls
That wasn’t just Armored Core.   That was Keanu Reeves climbing into his Armored Core!
SPELUNKY?
Просто ради Мара сносящего целый орочий грот на ходу. В то время как у реликов их сдувает ветер
Gdw, SIFU, Space marines, and ma baby boy armored core!!? Its enough to let me cry. Its an unexpected dream
Now THIS I can get behind!
This might be one of the coolest fuckin ideas I've ever seen
beggining of trailer Space Marines are fighting Tzanagors and at 1:04 daemon of Tzeentch (maybe slaanesh) and Space Marine with Plasma pistol, space marine is somehow frozen in time as the demon moves
Remember how some Love, Death and Robots episodes had unique vision and emotion? We can remove all that and replace it with recognizable IP. Why take risks when you can play it as safe as Illumination did with Mario movie?  Result: Everyone watches this. Almost no one likes it. -> Green light for more seasons. "Sigh"
This is a fantasy coming true. Hype is real
finally something to look forward to watch in this year 🤩🤩
0:52 is this Keanu Reeves ..?!
OH MY GOD
For the Emperor !
Waiting for elden ring 😁😁
No FIFA? Good.
Undertale show when
Seeing UNREAL TOURNAMENT in there gives me hope Epic didn't completely abandon the franchise that shaped their company in every way. Some might say UT was just a glorified engine demo, but game engine without a game is just a code, and UNREAL series (and UNREAL TOURNAMENT in particular) was The game to show the power of Unreal Engine. Epic is not Fortnite. Epic is UNREAL, period.
More 40K more of the time
Okay... This is actually really cool. Whoever thought of this, genius.
You lost me at concord
HELL YEAH ARMORED CORE MENTIONED
Waiting for left4dead 😁😁
Oh BOI
HOLY SH*T
wait why is chinese mobile legends part of this?
"Inspired by your favorite video games" - Shows Concord
Hells yeah… this is the kind of shit I want to see more often!!
Love Death + Robots with videogames... Let's fucking go.
megaman??!
I’m hype when I saw kratos but why there is modern building behind him
We locked in
Ye sahi hai..!! But.. Kratos ko ruin nahi kar dena..!! 😅😅
Who try to sneak CONCORD in this master piece  T T
😮😮😮😮😮
🔥🔥🔥
That boy at 0:57 looks awfully A.I Generated. Still hype though
I'm here for it. I anything connected to Love, Death, and Robots
Is that Keanu? 0:53
So hyped for this
im here for the space marines that's is all
Cinematic trailers finally turned to cinema
Warhammer 40k let's gooooooooooooo
Concord?? Really??
So Love Death + Robots been silent for this. I'm sold
Concord over: elden ring, bloodborne, dark souls, elder scrolls, metal gear, diablo, starcraft, bioshock, zelda, devil may cry and many many more... but we get concord? What missed opportunity  hopefully they bring more seasons and more games in the future.. I cannot wait for this!! 🙌
Amazon is getting ahead of Netflix and Disney productions.
You know how I watched the whole She hulk and Echo for 12 minutes of Daredevil? Well... The same now but with Kratos.
Omfg
So Love death and robots but more epic
Wait, so there's going to be an Anthology series from the creators of Love, Death + Robots, FEATURING GAME IPS like Megaman, Warhammer, Dungeons & Dragons, etc.!?  Okay, now I HAVE to watch that!
Times when having an Amazon prime subscription makes all the difference
Warhammer es lo que esperamos ver, gracias
"Concord" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman Megaman
Crossfire?! It's my childhood! I'm in!
Can't wait for the 12 hour episode of Civilization VI
Seeing Keanu Reeves potentially piloting a NEXT was something I didn't know I needed
I got a feeling this is gonna look amazing in HDR
Congrats to Blur Studios 🎉
บลิงท์ ทไวซ์
Looks good!
1:15 WTF REALLY!? Honor Of Kings!!? Im so excited!!
ARMORED COREEEEEEEEEE
Dark Pictures, this is a proper anthology
CONCORD?!? Why in the hell do they have fucking Concord of all things in here?!   -The game hasn't even been out for a year (in fact it still hasn't been released as of this trailer) unlike the others which hold a legacy or have been out for more than that.  -It has not reached players numbers similar to the other games, so you can't even claim its a game "young but burning a trail through the industry". -It is not an innovative or uniquely designed enough of a game that it would leave a lasting impact on how future games might be designed.  -Finally its also not well liked or hyped by the gaming community at large. That is not a personal opinion that is a fact. (I'm not going to waste my time explaining into why it isn't liked. Others can make their claims as to why.)
Omg omg honor of kings 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭YiXing❤❤❤❤❤
0:53 Keanu Reeves??
All I can say is hell yeah
og kratos pls..
MEGA MAN?!? This may be the tipping point for me regarding which streaming platform I consider the best. Please, do it well. Mega, Roll, Light, Willy, X, Zero, Sigma, they all deserve the best. Good luck 🤟🏻💖✨
Brother I don't want to wait till December. I'm so fucking hyped
Okay... Prime... *Sheds tear* I'm in. 🎉
It's sad that they didn't even consider beloved games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto
Annnnnndddddd, I'm in
Concord? naw im good
OK. those creative minds were working here. That's why we didn't see LOVE, DEATH + ROBOTS in Netflix.
For all Unreal tournament fans we got Malcolm  at 0:41 and at 0:50 and we got the map Facing worlds at 0:48 HOLY SHIT!!! =D for someone that played UT99-2004 like crazy this episode will be fun to se what they do =D
Ngl I need me a darksiders episode if it gets a second season
OMG! HOLLY EGGS!
I am beyond happy that something like this was approved and made. Normally you expect stuff like this to be in corporate oblivion but here it is.
The homie was just telling me about this a few weeks ago and hear the trailer is 😎
[ READY PLAYER ONE ] ( 2018 )🕰️⬅️ vibes 🤔💭
:)
I think this is going to perfectly capture what Ready Player One was trying to be.
THIS IS GOING TO FLIPPIN  EPIC!!!!
And... Why we have a concord in this series??
Aaaasaaaaashhhhhh!
What is this? Movie, game, series??
No titanfall😔😔
0:53 Was that Keanu playing as Silverhand?
Armored core?!
concord lmfao get outta here
It looks totally amazing
Epic Lineup: Warhammer 40k Unreal Tournament New World Aeturnum PlayStation Dungeons and Dragons Outer Worlds 2 Pac Man Honor of Kings Armored Core Mega Man Exodus Spelunky Crossfire Concord Sifu
Bro this might be the mother of all video game adaptations, I was going frame by frame trying to process all this, suddenly FACING WORLDS WTF
MEGAMAN IS IN THIS!?🤯
0:43 is that Grigori from Dragon's Dogma??
This is just Ready Player One for late millennials and early zoomers, right?
Ohh 😮 wtf I'm in babeé
Here's hoping y'all don't mess it up with weird political nonsense. Keep to the games and the stories THEY are telling. Keep your own opinions out of it. And this has the potential for greatness. A show revolving around "extra content" in games we love? That's absolutely brilliant and I can't wait. Plus WARHAMMER!!!!!!!
We're seeing the dawn of the MCU, but for Warhammer 40k and I'm here for it.
For Emperor ....
So hype for Sifu!!!!
Blur pushing the boundaries of visual possibilities again. Absolute legends.
KRATOS
We need dovahkiin dude bring Skyrim developers
"15 stories inspired by your favourite video games."  MY favourite video games? Holy crap, I can't wait to watch episodes inspired by Final Fantasy IV, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father, Noctropolis, and Genital Jousting!
What is Kratos doing in modern day?
Is it me or is the thumb nail picture look just like darth plaguis 5 second scene in the acolyte?
Cyberpunk raaahhh
For the Emperor.
0:42 Finally, a dragon.
MALCOLM from Unreal Tournament!  Now that is a face and name I've haven't seen/heard from in literally decades.
At 00:24 the character in the  Pac-Man bit, the guy in the thumbnail, has the UGSF logo on his robe-- the United Galaxy Space Force is used to tie a bunch of Namco franchises like Ace Combat, Galaga, and Dig Dug into a connected timeline, a website exists that shows the whole thing but it hasnt been updated since 2014. Wonder how much it'll tie into the episode, seeing the kind of direction they're taking with Pac-Man
chat am i seeing this right?? unreal tournament?? For real?
Its enough to make a grown man cry
0:26 honor of king😮❤❤
"15 STORIES INSPIRED BY YOUR FAVORITE GAMES"     *Shows Concord*    LIER!!!!!
Esto va a ser épico papus
Gimme it!! Gimme it!!!
I think I saw a flash of Kratos. But the Sifu stuff has me hooked
Another gaming fanservice content that I'll only watch by torrenting, specially being something biased towards Playstation.  I wouldn't be surprised if it ever comes out that this list had the slimy hands of Sony, and otherwise it would have Link, Fox McCloud, Master Chief or Marcus Fenix appearances.
Darth Plagueis the Wise what are you doing here?
WARHAMMER! 40K!!!! me vuelvo locoooooo
That intro scene is AMAZING
SKQLLS,SKALSKSKS
Thought that was Darth Plaguis in the cave 😂
Hells yeah love me some space marine in the mix soo hyped
So like what is this a game a series like love death and robots , i am still confused
Megaman is back
As hard as a diamond in an ice storm
Is it gonna be like Ready Player One? Or just a compilation of each video game cutscenes?
How tf are they gonna do Pac-Man
This is a gamer dream
Imagine a new megaman legends game with these graphics. 🤯
Pac-Man's being cool as ever, even Mega Man. Holy cow, this is going to be an amazing series to watch. 👍 :]
And one thing, is Stellaris is also there? The alien on the thumbnail looks like from Stellaris.
So amazon made 40K space marines in a cool animation????  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
0:59 tank?😮
Maybe this will get games workshop to get rid of their awful streaming service
Anthologies suck
Finally some warhammer content.
Spelunky? Awesome!
0:08 looks SUSPICIOUSLY like a shot from the astartes animation series👀
0:49 Yo, the god KRATOS is in here!!!
The emperor protects!
They should added Half-Life
The mention of Unreal Tournament brought a tear to my eye
😭Its going to be real good😭
Seeing underrated games like sifu and mega man  be brought into a new life is the BEST THING
I really hope with this they realize how good game adaptations well done are, and how much their community actually cares about their lore and story behind
I literally gasped out loud when I saw Megaman.
Ni modo, toca buscar el lore de cada juego
Ain’t no way they snuck Concord onto this list LMAOOO
Gamer-Chads! Rise-up!
Esto…… esto es algo que hemos esperado por años…… nunca pense que llegaria un dia en el que los vídeojuegos sean mas que solo un gusto raro que muy pocas personas tenian, pero con los últimos años vimos que las series y películas basadas en videojuegos son posibles, y esto, escuchen, ESTO sera un antes y un despues para los videojuegos y como lo ven las personas
Don't screw this up, Amazon...
Armored core and Megaman in a high fidelity cinematic medium makes me so excited to be alive right now. This is incredible
If there's ever a season 2... they gotta do Half-Life and/or Death Stranding!!
my SECRET LEVEL season 2 wishlist: - Apex Legends - Titanfall 2 - Fallout - Dying Light - FTL - Deus Ex - Deep Rock Galactic - Disco Elysum - Hades - HALO - Left 4 Dead - Mass Effect - Monster Hunter - No Man's Sky - The Elder Scrolls  what's yours?
ロックマン！！
Sorry what? Outer Worlds 2!? What a fucking way to stealth announce that 😂
This art style would be perfect for MegaMan X.
Better have bloodborne in here if Playstation is involved. Another year till its 10 year anniversary.
This is insanity, I freakin' cried of joy. But, I am the only one who wanted during the whole trailer to see Shepard appear at some point ? T-T Anyway, can't wait to watch it !
anybody know what the closing music is? 1:32
Holy shit is that Kratos god of war in real life New York
They really added Concord like it was gonna save the game
Space marine let’s gooooooo!!
concord? really? the game not even release yet.
ARMORED CORE LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOO
HOLY SHIT
WHERE IS DOTO?
Armored Core being here means that getting an episode of one of their soulsborne universes isn't out of the picture..
LET´S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Space marines
This will make history in how "videogame adaptations" are done from now on
Mega Man?! I'm in....
Please.. MULTIPLE seasons
SECRET LEVEL SECRET LEVEL  SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET LEVEL
We need an episode of TitanFall 2
Prepare yourself guardsmen, for it is the Emperors will!
It reminds me of the old PlayStation commercials <long live play>. I'd love to see a return to the days of games that gave players a sense of accomplishment.
ayo tf happened to kingdom hearts this shit kinda gritty now ?
Chills
SIFU GOTY
ARMORED CORE🔥🔥🔥💯💯🔥💯💯💯‼️‼️
Yes yes more LDR please and thank you. Most I've been hyped for an Amazon Prime release in a long time
Warframe, metin2 and the evil within for the second season 🗿👍🏻
God, I only want one thing... a Dark Souls episode on a second season
Why did you forget that Mega Man is just a child? 😢
0:27 i see li bai from HOK there, am i right?
RIP Astardes
MODERN DAAAAAAAAY
Space marines?
MegaMan X, 8 Letters
TIAMAT
Choo choo! All aboard the hype train!!! I’m here for this!
Imagine a cyberpunk one😱
This trailer, I haven’t felt like a young kid in a long time… I can feel the passion and love these creators and teams have put into this project and I am so incredibly touched. Warhammer 40K, Keanu Reeves, Idris Elba, Clive Standen and the God of War himself, Christopher Judge. Revel stoked.
Should have "The Binding of Isaac"
For the emperor
The list says “various PlayStation Studios beloved entities” and we see kratos in a modern city could that mean he’s in spider-man’s new york?
We got a show for you 621
RIP to all the Ravens who couldn't be here to see this.
ARMORED CORE
Cross firé 🗿🗡️
This is gonna be a treat for my OLED monitor 👌🔥🔥🔥
I mean, why crossfire? Just why? Out of all shooter games and they chose crossfire? We got Halo, Doom, fucking Wolfenstein would be cool to get an animation but why crossfire? How much did korea paid their studios? Seriously i just wanted to know  And don't even mention concord, that shit never exist for normal people.
I thought that was Darth Plagueis first glance @ the thumbnail!😭 I got excited asf!🤣
Alv el Cross!! pinche juegazo
Cool
That space marine running into a person so fast that the person's body explodes into chunks... 😱😮🥹 It's beautiful.
Epic Goosebumps can't  wait
Spelunky?!?! Is this a fever dream????
Really excited
Wherw metal gear.
Concord lol
even if it winds up not hitting I'm down. eager to see the AC part especially, but good to see some familiar faces too i.e. megaman <3
Can someone clue me in? Is this kinda like a Ready Player One adaptation kind of thing?
Im so happy armored core get attention
stop being panzies and just accept henry cavill warhammer proposal
Space marine? Warhammer 40 000
SIFUUUUUUUUU
Cant wait for the "f3male empowerment" and all the upcoming DEI flops
OH MY FUCKING GOD
Great, more bastardization of 40k lore by Amazon. GW’s greed is destroying the franchise.
Unreal Tournament!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH LET'S GO A GROUP THAT CAN BRING VIDEO GAME MOMENTS AND STORIES TO A THEATRICAL AUDIENCE!? LET'S GOOOOOOOO
Sifu,space marine,diabolical 4,dragons dogma,star wars but forespoken shouldn't be on this list it was trash. Should gotten Ghost of Tsushima.
Там просто обязана быть Смута
THIS WILL BE AMAZING
Pac-man…I’m sobbing rn.
@prime video since youve snagged this beautiful set of games with sony involved could you maybe see if they will let you do something with jak and daxter and naughty dog?❤
Still no titanfall 😞
Holly Emperor, Valrak was right!
SIFU was an unexpected pleasure, but what in truly hyped for is Armored Core making an appearance!
Count is at 40K thumbs up.... maybe we should keep it there :)
The guy at 1:20 looks like Logan Paul
WE GETTIN ARMORED CORE
FOR THE EMPEROR!
HOLY THIS IS AMAZING
So basically 4 of these episodes are paid promotions for new games people don’t care about. We have Concord, Crossfire, Exodus, and Honor of Kings, which are all new games that have their own episode that definitely just paid promotions. There is also New World but that probably isn’t even paid because it’s a game owned by Amazon, so it probably isn’t just promotion too.
*GAME ON!* 🎮
What’s the song at the end of the video after the trailer? Shazam can’t find it.
Ooomg is that KEANU REEVES ON 0:54 ????????? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I thought this is a spin off of Ready Player One cause of the name and graphics.
This will actually be peak, way better than any halo show or borderlands movie
SEEEEEEELOOOOOKOOOOOOOOOOO  man sou artista 3D e desenvolvedor de game, isso explodiu a minha mente mds, quero agora, SÓ QUALIDADE VINDO RAPAZIADA
Im cu**ing, im so wet rigth now my guys
Armored Core, Warhammer, and The Outer Worlds got me most hype. They confirmed that the Warhammer episode will be about Titus.
W A R H A M M E R
😍😍😍
God is good.
you son of a b*** I"m in!
MEGA MAN!! PEW PEW PEW
so what is this a show to watch or game to play ?
ARMORED COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
And you know halo HAD to go to fucking paramount
I'm amazed they haven't already made Sifu into an animated series. This should be good!
Hype.
How'd Concord get in there?
Hype is unreal
Armored core?
Daddy can't wait
This shit could make HISTORY, I'm absolutely in!!!
10 Years ago, something like this would have included the Master Chief. It still saddens me how far Halo as a franchise has fallen 😢
Wait…the outer worlds…2???
This is how you use cgi 😊 very tasteful
Omg omt omg omg omg omg omt omt omg omg
holy fucking shit this is actually a dream come true I loved the early seasons of love, death, robots this is gonna be amazing
Did I see Concord?
LOOKS SO GOOD ALSO SAME CREATORS OF LOVE DEATH AND ROBOTS!!? I know it’s going to be amazing 🤩
my brain just got fucked
Is this cavills 40k?
Missed opportunity for one incredible halo animation/short story.
Bruh the market research team for Concord needs to be fired… somehow they seriously thought it could be in this alongside Kratos Sifu and Space Marines… c’mon
ให้ผมเดานะทำ Shot Animation สำหรับพวก video game ใช่ไหม
im sat!!!
Of all game franchises and they chose Concord ☠️
Now this is amazing
I'm in
wow
Meh we'll see. I wouldn't be surprised if this turns into cringe.
0:47 Mega Man
Terrible, it’s the awful new Kratos. Greek mythology Kratos is way better.
I saw "MegaMan" pop up in the list of games, but saw precisely zero MegaMan content in the trailer.
FOR THE EMPEROR OF MANKINF BROTHERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me: Sees space marine 😮  *leonardo pointing meme  👆😮
My birthday is going to be lit no matter what now. ❤❤❤❤
0:51 That's my fuckin boy right there, FOR TSUSHIMA
WE NEED A NEW UNREAL TOURNAMENT GAME
WARHAMMER 40K BABY LETS GOOOOO!!!!
I have never been so fucking hyped in my life....
KRATOS
space marines yeah
So this is what the Love, Death, and Robots creators have been working on!!!! It looks absolutely sick I can’t wait to see an anthology of all my favorite video games
0:45 AN AC?!
HOLY FUCKING SHIT! LDR meets our favorite games?!? YES FUCKING PLEASE!
Why is honor of kings here? 💀
I straight up cried with this, from Megaman to just seeing Kratos there for half a second, that's most of my life right there.
Please add Crysis and Metro in Season 2 😍
best .. please dub in hindi also
I don't know why, but I was hoping to see Dante, Vergil or even Nero, but at least we got Kratos, the ghost of Sparta, the god killer
Is the Warhammer from the same guy that did the "Astartes Project" fan film?
OH FRICK, NOW THIS IS A TRAILER.
Did I see a space marine literally tank a car
THIS IS CINEMA!!!
I am cringing so hard it physially hurts
Wait is this a game or a tv series??
This series can have so much potential... Imagine if there was an Overwatch episode, or maybe a Metal Slug episode
Solo por esto comprare la membresía.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now entering a new era where video games are becoming a major source of inspiration for movie adaptations.
Next, we need Outer Wilds...
Why not make another LDR instead of that?
Best trailer of the gamescom and it's not even a game
Honestly really excited about this. Cheeky mofos even opened the trailer up with Space Marines.
WOW
Darth Plagueis in the thumbnail
0:55 GARTEN OF BANBAN?!?!?!?!?!?
OMG, ITS MEGA MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The thumbnail gave me Stellaris vibes
from your favourite games, doesn't have Destiny or Halo
Man, bloodborne would've gone so hard with this.
Hypeddd
Why no Elden Ring or Dark Souls?
🔥🔥
I'm so fkn ready!
FOR THE EMPEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRR
Future games to be considered if there will be a season 2. Add more in comments.  Need for Speed, Ghost Recon, Doom, Wolfenstein, Metro, Far Cry,...
HOLY HELL 40K I AM FOAMING AT THE MOUTH RN
looks like zoomer garbage
I’m trying to process this! The fact that Mega Man is gonna be there just blows my mind!
pac man's a bad guy..?
I’m guessing this was that “secret project” that guy who made the Astartes animation got hired to work on 😱
boy, im watching the boys on amazon prime
Isso vai ser absolutamente incrível
Please let there be a Bladurs Gate story
Oh my god.
Yo dude, this far one of the best ideas they could have.
Inspired by...not at least based on...no thanks.
0:47 oh me Megaman is back!!!
OMG warhammer!
...I've only play one of the games mentioned, so I'm going to be so lost. At least it will look pretty.
KEANU REEVES IS A FUCKING RAVEN LESSGOOO
wait warhammer in here too?
I'm down for Unreal! The franchise was a big part of childhood for most of the viewers probably, I'm totally hype!
Doing gods work
This seem like an expensive and elaborate last ditch effort from Sony marketing just to sell Concord.
This looks nothing less than amazing. Please dont drop the ball with dumb decisions or put your hands in it to make forced inclusion or some other stuff that is killing great ideas now a days. Just. Just let creativity flow. Please, let it flow.
Can't wait for the VFX artist reacts episode for this!
OMG! This looks so amazing!… Want to see it so bad!
LOVE DEATH ROBOTS CREATORS LETS GO BOYS
0:51 is that Keanu Reeves?
series or anthologies? I hate anthologies
For Ultrama For The Emperor!!!!!!!
This part , this little part is the better of my life ❤
This looks cool as hell
Concord ? Someone likes to lose money
What a great idea. This has the possibility of being amazing. Please don’t use it to preach at us, just fucking entertain us and we will watch the shit. Fair trade
God of war, Sifu and Warhammer all in the same place?! SIGN ME UP🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Did i spy Kratos and something from Warhammer 40k?
Armored Core Concord Crossfire Dungeons & Dragons, Exodus Honor of Kings Mega Man New World: Aeternum PAC-MAN various PlayStation Studios games Sifu Spelunky The Outer Worlds Unreal Tournament Warhammer 40,000
GREAT IDEA !!!!! LOVE IT !!!!
ah yes my favorite game concord
I wish it was Megaman X but having Megaman Rep is good enough ❤
Mostly hyped for the space marine and armored core ones.  But what game universe are the modern day looking soldiers in black from??
If its from the same guys that did  Love Death + Robots this can only mean its all bangers
Spelunky is by far the best announcement on here thank you from the 00000000000001% percent of people on the planet who play it
BRUH WHAT
por el emperador de la humanidad
AAAA ME VENGOOOO 💦💦💦💦
Sifu ghost of tushima ware hammer what more cold you want……….. dead cells DOOM or pacific drive wold be nice for season 2
SPACE MARINE 2 episode!?!? GOD OF WAR?!?! MEGA MAN!?!?! OHHHHH MYYYYY GOODD!!!!!
Its so peak.
Most of these sound amazing but a few of them sound kind of meh. Like Concord? Really? Sony must have REALLY been banking on it not tanking like it did (unless it’s a different Concord than the dumpster fire that came out this year?) I get New World is there because it’s an Amazon property so self-promotion. Still meh. Idk anything about Exodus so that could be good. Honor of Kings representing MOBAs is an odd choice but I guess it’s more popular than I realized. All the rest sound incredible though. Definitely plan to watch this.
I'm... I'm actually kinda intrigued here 🤔.
Tom holand Megaman!????
The only game missing with what I would call a truly unique setting is Kenshi. A scuffed RPG with a compelling and brutally bizarre world. Worth looking up
I want 10 seasons of this shit  AND ONE OF THOSE BETTER HAVE HALO
Jesus, is that Jin Sakai?
Warhammer lfg
I wonder how they're gonna make Pac-Man look cinematic
Yoooooooooo
Megaman!!!!!!!
Kratos in Modern Day???
The emperor protects-
Amazon our saviour ❤
Falto from software
1:15 ARMORED CORE BABY, LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!!
Pong please
I was going to say is almost kind look like the series of Ready Player One but it's so sick secret level I go 10/10 but I don't want it like short episodes no I want long episodes that's what I want
I'm onboard for space marines don't give a toss for anything else
Man, say what you will about Amazon as a company, but you gotta admit whoever is deciding on what shows get green lit for production is killing it.
i like how it said your favorite games and it put concord in there like it threw money at the studio to please save there game
Cool.  I wish I could have picked the video games.  But I’m definitely in on this one
Ah yes, we passing on the Concord one ty
THIS IS HERESY AND I LOVE IT
Uollllllll
Ok, I think Amazon is on to something here. People have been asking Game Studios like Blizzard who make kickass animations to just make more cinematics for their games. Amazon went a step further and did it for multiple unrelated games.
honor of kings 😍
Elden ring/dark souls and doom would go so crazy in this
Warhammer!
Holy Fucking Shit!!! Honestly been waiting on a movie or series like this for forever!! Thank you Blur Studio!!! This is about to be MAGIC!!!!!!!!!
Mega Man!
This actually looks tight as hell
1 frame each of GoT and GoW and I am so fucking hyped.
I just KNOW they got the motherfucker from astartes on that warhammer project
will this be a movie or game i don't get it?
Yooo Honor of Kings mentioned
I kinda like the whole idea about this show, and it can also continue the story or create new stories about it. But it can also be a great way for companies to promote their game let’s just say rockstar want to promote one of their games we can use Grandtheft auto of six the episode can show us the atmosphere of the game or they can continue stories like red, dead redemption one. But to be honest, if they can continue this if they show does so well they can honestly keep doing stories like this like I want to see red dead redemption, two or call of duty. The endless of possibilities.
Yes!!!!!!!!
WHY TF IS CONCORD IN THERE 💀💀💀
what Darth Plageius doing in the thumbnail
we have been blessed to day we got the borderlands 4 cinematic trailer, some bo6 gameplay for campaign and a dying light trailer with Crane and now this how much more are we gonna get. lets just hope theres no more stuff to do with minors becouse this year has defiantly had its moments lol
Concord? At least the animation will be good
I'm mixed on it. I love games and movies that actually follow storyline. But I disliked how LDR did their stuff. I enjoy a full story not a tease of something that could be more
Anyone know the music that was used in the trailer? Darude Sandstorm? Na! XD
UNREAL TOURNAMENT MENTIONED  But why tf Concord is there lmao, we all know it's going to flop hard
H*lly shit, honor of kings
War Hamer, Sifu, other worlds, Mega man, Kratos, ori, halo, Bioshock, Keanu maybe Cyberpunk, Titanfall, dungeon & dragons, maybe elder scrolls, destiny, metro maybe, ghost of Tsushima, arcane, star wars, fallout maybe mad max and a plague tale and pac man
Cinematic Game Trailer : The Extended
Por el emperador!!!!!
Holy crap I can’t wait to watch that.
0:51, Elisabeth from bioshock infinite?
the only thing I'm questioning is Concord everything else looks really cool
omg
who dafuq invited concord
Mega Man! Rock!
Lieutenant Titus body checking an chaos vehicle is not what I expected to see, but I can now say I'm as hard as adamantium.
"...set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games."  Not sure what CONCORD is doing in there, but I'll be sure to add this to their marketing budget on my spreadsheet.
Maybe this will prove that Warhammer 40k shows or movies works better as a top tier animations than live shows
the fact that Outer worlds is in the middle of all these titans is funny to me, i bet they were the only ones who paid to be here instead of get paid lol
This looks so freaking EPIC!!!!
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa 😲
I am beyond hyped for this..
I'm skipping Concord 🤣🤣🤣
I’m almost in tears because this is sheer hype and vast animation from great games 🔥🔥🔥
Is this where the Astartes guy has been?!
I'm a simple man. I see space marine I become super hyped
Season two we need metro, AC, Diablo, Callisto, and heck throw in chivalry
Twisted Metal, please!
Love death + robots = cool
Never played most of these games but ok, want to watch
One of the coolest things I've ever seen a trailer for. Couldn't be more excited
Actually looks good
Im so excited for this
Looks good 😮
This show is trying to unify the gamersphere. Respect.🤯
Pls not dei involved
So this is basically Love Death +Robots season 3 huh? Awesome
SPELUNKY!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Warhammer!!!!
Warhammer 40 k!!! And Megaman??!!! i'm already SOLD!!!!
621 Raven
Love Death + Robots of Prime Video
🤯 mega man at 58s
Are you ready to level up?
Really hype for SIFU!!
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA?!
Armored Core, 40k, Cyberpunk, D&D... Geez Amazon what got into you.
by guys that made love death and robots.... les go
Jak and Daxter II would be awsome
ARMORED CORE!!!!!
Yo why is PAC Man here
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes... 😂
On a scale of 1 to HOLY SH*T  I'm definitely at HOLY SH*T
For the emperor of humanity
SIFU!!!!
So F*cking PEAK! Can't wait
MEGA MANS FINALLY GETTING SOMETHING YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Looking forwards to the works of all creative people in this project!
There better be an Elden Ring episode. Ohhh boy ...
The one thing I’m excited for is Metro and God of War
I feel like It'll only include projects from Playstation or PC and no ogs like Nintendo or Sega (apart from Mega Man whom I think is from Nintendo). Other than that it seems pretty cool
Dude this is gonna go crazy
... Spelunky!?
i cry a ocean , look that litle blue bomber omg
0:49 KRATOS!!!!
Unreal Tournament?!?!?! Am I dreaming?!
ARMORED CORE????? YOOOOOOO
no elden ring fumbled
Now i gotta finnish got before december 10
I had a conversation with a fellow fromsoft enjoyer just a couple of weeks ago; he told me NEVER, EVER would they bring armored core to a film or series format before Elden Ring or DS… guess he was wrong. Im so hyped. 40k looks great too.
A gente nunca pede nada, mas a Amazon Prime sempre entrega aquilo que queremos!!!
Looks like Arcane got some competition 👀
Total goosebumbps man
Brothas, *WE RIDE TO PRIME!*
IDK.. this series feels like Amazon doesn't know what video game to adapt as a series and just trying 1 episode of 15 different game to see which one stick and which one fails..... I'm sure after this series end Amazon will announce some of these video game to real series.....
DAMMIT. I'm in
This is so beautiful, let us hope they can back this trailer up with amazing stories
Mega man!!!! Mega man!!!! Please dont suck this up with social nonsense. Just make honest true to game stories
ARMORED CORE
*Looks at thumbnail*  I thought "The Acolyte" got cancelled??
This is just gonna be fast food entertainment.
*_Fino_*
MEGAMAN!
KNEW IT, WARHAMMER
You had me at Visionaries..........
Im just soooo happy to see Sifu here...
Warhammer baby lets goooooooooo
good looking
Brought to you by people who hate you.
Warhammer 40kQQQQ
If this gets a season 2, we need a Dark Souls episode
Concord and Crossfire seem like such random picks in otherwise a lot of classic characters and franchises.
cried at megaman
Wasn't expecting 40K. This looks hype, I hope they don't fumble it.
Is there a way to set up an alert so I'm made aware when this hits? I'm gonna forget if its 4 months out, and I don't log into my prime video often enough to check.
MEGA MAN AND ARMORED CORE! And that WH40K looks like the Astartis guy! OH HELL YEAH, BABY
This is such a fat dub never thought something like this would be possible
Concord?!!!?! :"D
Please, good Lord, give us a second season with Halo, Elden Ring and Red Dead Redemption.
First Netflix, now Amazon. Then what? Art in both worlds
*READY PLAYER TWO*
The Emperor Protects !!!!!!
MY GOAT SIFU IS HERE!
Megaman! 😮😮😮😮
Just let this guys make an actual series of a game and i can confirm. it will be absolute cinema
I was told outer wilds was here and felt robbed when it wasnt.
Oh. My. God. 🤯 literal goosebumps!!
holy SHIT this looks good.
Concord 👎👎
meh
The Best Birthday Gift I've ever asked for 😭😭
This looks cool, but god, i do not envy the copywrite lawyers who worked on this show.
i'm just here for 40K
any made by Sweet Baby Inc?
Bro, the thumbnail reminded me of Darth Plagueis' scene in The Acolyte 😭🤣
Isso caralho, finalmente um lançamento foda
No Bloodborne or Demon Souls.  Sad.
Show of hands, who's here for Mega Man and Pac-Man? 💙💛
song??
HOLY SHIT MEGA MAN!!!!
Sifuuu!!! Lets goo
I saw Kratos and an Astartes, I’m in
DID I JUST SEE V FROM CYBERPUNK 2077???
As much as I love Megaman, I just can't trust the people behind Rings of Power to do him justice.  I should be excited but honestly I'm scared.
QUE IDEIA FODA!!
Annnnnd its going to suck
The Armored Core one tho omg
I know Mario is the most important video game character of all time, but for me, no video game character is greater than Mega Man, and no video game is greater than Mega Man 2.
I’m so hyped to see what they do for spelunky
Space marine: Kills Aliens for the emperor Draging a crate for the emperor walking down a dark hallway for the emperor pray to the emperor you don't die.
For the Emperor!!!
I hope this is successful I need next season to have     dmc,Warframe,Zelda, infamous,kingdom hearts there’s endless possibilities I can’t wait
Armored Core !!
Ok but remember. Concord.
We getting a Spelunky animation before GTAVI
The last thing i expected to see today
John Armored Core lives!
MEGAMAAAANN
The 40k one seems very familiar though… animation wise
unreal tournament I miss you so much
Is it just me or did I just see Mega Man?
MIRA LO QUE ES ESTO
They look kinda goofy
Am I wrong or is the song in the end is from Namco Museum? 1:30
Hey Prime can you work with Brandon Sanderson to bring his Cosmere universe to tv?
*sees the horrific robotic Pac-Man* What the Hell?! Why?! I mean, I'm definitely curious about the show now, but still, why?!
I was surprised enough to see Megaman on this list with the others but Unreal Tournament?!?! GODLIKE!!!
yeah you has me at "From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots" IM LOCKED IN
I think I saw either Master Chief or the Doom Slayer
Why is concord even here😂😂😂😂😂😂 that game has no business taking a slot to a much more deserving games
I'm curious are they getting the guy that did the fan animation astartes for the 40k one
0:47 WAS THAT MEGAMAN!!???
Bro i got chills.
I'm in 🤩😁
Had me at love death and robots.
Uncanny valley…
Wait a second... what Megaman, Classic? X? ZX?
Now that is just peak
Please tell me they all come out at once 🙏
So they move to Prime? They will thrive!
Disney could never…This is amazing.
Some of the most beloved and influential games in history and of our time... and also Concord is here 😐
Megaman, AC, 40k. Who sold their soul and what kind of sign at the bottom line deal do we have to agree to as well to participate(we will)? 🤩
MEGA MAN!!!!!
Feels fanmade, but not in the bad way. It feels fanmade because it’s so crazy to me that this is actually a real thing thats happening Insanely hyped for this
At first watch i saw green and orange armor and thought i saw Doom... it was not 😭 With blur doing it I'd hope to have a Halo episode too. ah no love for my green armored dudes
Looks interesting will watch
15????!!! OMG PRIME
Sifu MENCIONED BABY
MEGAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEM
SIFU!?
No hay palabras para describir lo emocionante que es esto
Aside from Mega Man and God Of War, I genuinely wonder how the Pac-Man episode will be like  Because the last scene is oddly interesting
If this is done correctly, man... this has the chance to be something really special. Amazon's dirty little fingers makes me worried, but I'm really hoping this ends up being some much needed fan service <3
If Prime keeps it up, they are the best streaming service. Their original ideas are amazing.
No GTA? my disappointment is immeasurable.
This Trailer gave me goosebumps but as soon as I saw Megaman I jumped out of my chair
Dude Sifu is one of my favorite games as well as Armored Core I’m so excited!
SIFU 🎉🎉🎉
I can't wait to see the Space Marines. Dunno what any of this other stuff is
Hopefully they do every character justice and give them dope scenes
why is concord there 😂😂😂😂 bro thinks he's on the team
if this is executed well, amazon is gonna be sitting pretty with this
WHY IS AMAZON BEING PEAK WTF
just when was about to cancel my subscription, still might because of the adds
Concord XD Still looks good.
There’s a pac-man episode?  I’m in.
How did they get the rights to all these franchises?!?!?!  Holy sht, man!!!
MEGAMAAAAAAAAAN MEGAMAAAAAAN SUPER FIGHTIN ROBOTS
SIFUUUUUUUU!
Somebody make a list of everything featured here
Consider my jimmies rustled
this is fire hell yeah
>Concord Yeah, no thanks. 👎  I hope all the 40k fans realize how much trouble Amazon has been causing Henry Cavill with his project, trying to change the established lore. Even with the Love Death + Robots crew, I am NOT optimistic.
SPAYCE MUHRINES!!!
RAAAAAAAAH ARMORED CORE
Spelunky 🥹
Oh man I'm crying! I WANT IT TO BE DECEMBER NOW
I'm so hyped for this series not because it's from the same creators of Love Death and Robots but because it will start streaming on my birthday. So I guess I can see this as a good birthday present.
I only came cause of 40k
Ima just be here for warhammer, everything else is just a side dish
It would be "Love, death and robots" but on Prime Video? I hope there is some little news, because at this point they could have done a season 4
Between the 1:01 and 1:02 marks during the quick flashes of faces there are 1 or 2 frames of the Idris Elba SM character in his MKX helmet with glowing green HUD symbols. One is the Ultramarines symbol on the left side and squad status markers on the right.
So is this like ready player one?
I didn't know I needed this but now it goes in my must watch list.
at 0:49 set playback to 0.25 and wait for a bit. you can see kratos in some sort of city. its a bit weird to see him in such a modern era.this was not the god of war series i had in mind.
She Armor my Core til a coral release
Remember when we always asked why they don’t make a movie out of videos game cinematics? I guess now they are giving that to us in a way.
Armored Core, Warhammer and God of war?! Shut Up and take my money!
Megaman is one of my favorite game series ever can’t believe he’s in this I’m kind of excited but idk if I like the design they went with for him
Happy to see SIFU still getting some love. Looking forward to seeing this.
An Armored core animation…dreams do come true 🥹  I really believe the lore of AC6 is deep as hell. I’ve only been wanting a deeper narrative told for the series my whole life lol
Can't wait for sifu!
thank god for the description cause the video game me nothing lol (well besides killer visuals)
BRO IMAGINE One of these being Cyberpunk 2077 story
ngl this is kinda hype
Everything is good until I saw Concord, well at least I'll know what episode to avoid, but overall pretty exited for everything else
wow Armored Core, Cyberpunk, Warhammer 40k heck even Megaman is finally having a day in the sun 🤯🤯🤯  hopefully this is just the tip of the iceberg, looking forward it😎👍
Wow, OK, holy shit
JIN SAKAI I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED  this better be good
They'll have space Marines in a side quest episode, but Amazon Prime is incapable of giving Warhammer 40k a proper adaptation? Makes sense.
this video cant have a single dislike
Was that Keanu???? No Cyberpunk? Are my eyes deceiving me?
Did Amazon just COOK?! I’ve been wanting another love death robots but this might be it boys
As someone who hasn't played any of these, meh.
Why is kratos in a modern day city? I dont really understand what this is, can someone please explain?
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG Armored Core gave me the absolute chills. THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH for this.  (Diablo would be absolutely awesome too btw haha.. and.. wow.. I'd literally cry if one day I see something like that with Lineage 2, but that is asking waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much haha)
Oh yeah... this is what excitement felt like...
Lets, f'ing, gooo!
SpaceMarines + Sifu + ArmoredCore + Megaman. The hype is real.
FOR THE EMPEROR!
How many years until next season..?
The spirit of Heavy Metal still lives on
I bet this is happening so Amazon can gage the stats for the potential God of War and Warhammer shows
“Fan service“ the series
SO FKN HYPED
Like a breath of fresh air
Who's still waiting on megaman to get off the moon in 2024?
YEEES!
Sounds like a movie for geeks, cringe tho
"15 epic stories"...... CONCORD XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
NEED MORE WARHAMMER 40K CONTENT!! This looks sooo good. The Emperor protects.
What am I looking at right now!? 😳
For the Emperor
Ghost of Tsushima ❤
Definitely didn't expect Spelunky.
As soon as I saw Kratos, it became my goal to watch this the moment it premieres!
in all honesty, the first 10 seconds are what sold it for me
Did i just see idris fucking elba as a primaris marine? I did not know i needed this but i did
Why does it have to be on prime??
Get fucked... hahaha  I'm so down for this.
Yo, Plagueis
I want season 2 already
that looked not just like Megaman but megaman LEGENDS
ARMORED CORE MENTIOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNEEEEDDDDDDDD
This is one of the best ideas for adult animated anthology series ever. Even games and franchises that aren't as big as warhammer or dnd and that normally wouldn't get full shows have a chance to show their worlds.
No Xbox games
Dead Space would be insane for this too, horror genre games
They got Sifu!!!!!
Mega Man!
God of war, a plague tale, sifu, armored core, and so many more!?!? Ok fine they got me hyped.
0:50 Does Kratos fight the F.B.I? I CAN’T WAIITTTT!!!!!!
PLEASE Mass Effect & Star Wars oh my god. Republic Commando, KOTOR, Battlefront anything 😭
Correct me if I'm wrong g but is kratos in the modern day?
0:49 Kratos in what looks like a modern day city? Will he fight the Statue of liberty or something?
Verga, sacaran algo de Dungeons and Dragons, rarisimo.
Jhon Wick in a MECHA? OK I'm in
CGI. No gameplay.
All these “chosen” movies are so ever done.
Q assim seja
My brain right now:  Ohh, It's cartoon?! Ohh,Its PBR? Ohh,Its cartoon? Ohh,Its PBR?!  . . . .
That E is one of the oldest designs ever
Pac man gonna be crazy
This is the way.
Starcraft?
Games have so many stories worth retelling through animation.  Exciting stuff.
WAIT, HOLD MY BEER
Lmao they have New World and Concord. Literally Ready Player One.
Wow, this is sad as a Halo fan. A Halo episode would have been great, but the franchise has gone down and we had a terrible tv series... Looks really great otherwise!
Let's go
Yoooooo
Never in a million years would I expect to see Spelunky on the list. Man does this make me excited!
Bro... rare amazon W
Yes!
Gamer senses are tingling…..in a GOOD way.
Astartes!!!!!!
SIFU ??? WHAT ??? HOW????? Like, actually, what story is there to tell other than the game's ?
My hype is immeasurable and my day is restored.
AMORED CORE?! WARHAMMER 40K?! HOLY SH-
It feels illegal for something like this to not have a Nintendo IP of some kind given their impact in gaming history, but I'm still floored.  December cant come fast enough.
This is so hype. BUT PLEASE, if there ever is a season 2. PLEASE TITANFALL 2
I wonder if we're going to get anything bloodborne related for the PlayStation studio stuff
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
I hope to the lawd above we get multiple seasons and/or an episode of Titanfall!
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
seems legit. dont let us down.
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL
0:50 is that keanu reeves?!
Finally!!! Hopefully they will not murder the series or the lore!!! ❤ Warhammer 40k highly expected among others
SO WE ARE PLAYING AS ALL MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS STORY SO COOL👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
If some indi games like hollow knight or rain world get dedicated episodes I'll demand more seasons!
coolness
se mamaron
w
MEGAMAAAAN!!! LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
Yo was that keanu?
wow, just wow
Darth Pleigueis? XD
캬
This better bring us an awesome Mega Man series
Defina fã service:...
I don't have a single clue how this was even made from a licensing and legal standpoint, I imagine it was extremely difficult to get all of these IP owners together, but what an incredible thing to achieve.
Oh I'm watching this!
Looked it
USE THE VOB TO CLOSE IN ON GIGABASE
MEgaman!!!
SPACE MARINES!!!
Sifu gonna be peak
Fuckin SICK!! I am so incredibly hyped for this,AAAHHHH! Warhammer, Mega-Man, Cyberpunk, and KRATOS!! What, the What!
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
I love animation so much ❤
Forgot everything else! Did I see a space marine 😮
I am beyond excited for 40k and unreal tournament. UT finally getting some love.! UT 2004 is my favorite game so this means a lot to me, and I just love Sci-fi so Exodus and 40k are hyyyyype
Just a polite reminder that Uwe Boll can gfh.
Keanu Reeve and Armor core wow
Armored Core is my main thing ever since I saw the trailer for VI, so happy it’s getting more attention
Sifu 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👴🏼
Oh shit! From Fincher's playground? I'm in!😊
HOLY FUCKING SHIT!
KRATOS?
yeooooo
Sifu, 40k, God of War, Let's goooo!!!
Holy shit, brilliant idea! If they do this great, it will be big
The titles went too fast, I didn't catch all of em.
MEGAMAN REP!!!!!
The rocket bursts in the Boltguns were magnificent. Should put on my white pants.
No Doom?
this is actually 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:12 Tiamat, after not appearing in the DnD film, shows up in a trailer alongside Kratos, AC, and 40K... well.
It said "Playstation", not "God of War"... there is a low, but not zero, chance that we may see Bloodborne hit the big screen
Returnal please
What an awesome idea for a show.
Yuk
All I see is CORRECTNESS.   And the possibilities are ENDLESS. They could make this show for DECADES and never run out of amazing stories to tell and introduce new fans to.   It's absolutely brilliant, and I'm proud to witness this.
Are my eyes deceiving me or did i catch a glimpse of Kratos, and Jin Sakai?
Megaman?? My Blue Bomber??? Im so freaking happy i will get to see any sort of cinematic story about my blue boy. I love that universe so much
this is a great idea! I can't wait!
Warhammer 40k 😊😊😊😊😊
Imagine a armored core show or a movie dude I’d be so godam hyped
I can’t be the only one who saw the thumbnail and thought that guy looked like he was from Stellaris.
How much insider is in Concord's team
Mega Man!
IM IN!!!!
Give me 40K!!! You can keep the rest
Now this is proper video game fanfiction material
HOLY FUCKING SHIT MY MIND IS EXPLODING EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOD
LET'S GOOOOOOO
THE SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT
Holy shit. It's a show im actually looking forward to, and that's not a remake of a remake or just plain uninteresting. Im in.
Why dafok is concord in it?
I AM SO HYYYYYYYYYPED!!! 🗣🔥🔥🔥
queria um ep voltado para elden ring
I don't get! What is this? New console? Or new service?
Amazon is prepping us for the 40k series.
actually some cool shit for once. I'm down
Wait y’all just gonna roll over for 40k. Haven’t you heard about the shit between Henry cavil and Amazon??
SPELUNKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY????????? wWHAT
This better be 20+ episodes
My little doggy mind is blown I'm super excited!!!!
Ain't nobody tryna watch a show that "celebrates the most beloved video games" but has an episode about CONCORD
Crossfire fans stabd up
I see Jin Sakai, I follow
I just coom
There better be a TITANFALL2 episode
Armored Core Animation by Death, Love and Robots creator? hell yes
OH MY GAWD This looks legit amazing. I've heard nothing about this, just came up in the list and I am HOOKED.
Well i guess this is why there hasn't been a new season of LDR
Omg it’s the unknown from Willy wonka.
ARMORED CORE NEEDS A STANDALONE SERIES
LYNX, RAVEN, GET IN THE AC!!!!
This looks AWESOME
W8 crossfre
Is it just me Or does the music sound like Contact with You
0:51 Is that Keanu? What game?
Color me surprised that the warhammer trailer actually looks sick. But to be expected from the makers of Love Death and Robots. Adult stories told for the passion of world and character building rather than political view injections. Can't wait.
>concord  LMAO
THAT'S how you do good shows
ew this is going to suck
ARMORED CORE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hmm, this could be interesting.
finally some new Mega Man content
This looks GOOD
Megaman ;-;
OH MY GOD THE SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT!!! MEGAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
The selection of games is so wild and not expected but amazing selection, apart from concord which seems to be dead before release
This is absolutely a gift.
Wow I love megaman he looks amazing..!!
I see Mega Man. I have to watch this now.
Love Death + Robots was great, but Amazon Prime could F up a wet dream.. and has.
MANO QUE INCRÍVEL
MEGA MAN
At least SOMEONE didn't forget about Unreal Tournament.
Holy shit it's megaman
I hope each one is 2 hours
there were so many opportunitys and they make concord XD
The music and video sync for this has SUCH Tommee Profitt vibes.
An absolute travesty that Halo doesn't get an episode here. Looks great though! Wish Microsoft would have put some more effort into this like Playstation apparently has.
I've recently gotten into the 40k lore and holy crap that universe is amazing. They've been working on it for 37 years and there's well over 400 books I think?
How long are these episodes going to be?
Do one for Guild Wars.
W da fck another univeres i hope see him. Like Shonen Jump,Marvel,Dc,Square enix,Naugthy Dogs,Sta monica and etc ..
CHILLS. THIS GIVES ME CHILLS!!
don't f up kratos...don't f up kratos....
MEGA MAN!!!!
God of War set on Modern Day?
Actually dope asf.
MEGAMAN? I’m so fucking in
So it's the video game version of "What if...?"?
Dark Souls? Devil May Cry? Nothin'?
I wanted to ask if somebody else thought that the warriors at the begging looked like space marines but no these are actual FUCKING space marines
Armored Core??? LET'S FUCKING GO
Deadass thought this was Ai ngl
Warhammer bros. Our time is now
No Halo, Microsoft fucked up yet again
Have our dreams just come true?
Look cool but Concord is totally out of place lol.
I swear to God, judging by the VOB in trailer, if the Armored Core episode will start with 'Someone is always moving on the surface', because it will be centered around 'For Answer' am gonna nyut
This is epic.
Goosebumps are killing me, cz i just saw kratos
Someone say Unreal Tournament?
40k say no more
Diablo ıv please
sick
0:58 HOLY CRAP! He looks so good!                                     (And cute😳)
Did I fucking see astartes ?????
I want to just imagine what it would be like if it had a Dragon Quest episode in it.
Some of this looks incredible, some of it looks much less incredible.
This is smart. Just stick to the game and not inject the bs
The outer worlds good.
Too bad it's on prime, ads, no thanks.
why is concord on there it’s so bad  it’s not even funny.
That's hype asf
SPELUNKYYYYYYY
“You’re favourite games…” shows Concord…
This is a fkn dream come true. Can't wait to see 40k, Megaman, Armored Core, and Sifu
Bruh why is concord here?
Sifu!!!!! 🔥
So hyped
Já tô empolgado!! A @primevideo tá arrasando nas produções!!🔥👏👏👏
Hope they add sora and mario and sonic in season 2
THE SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT 🗣🗣🗣  MEGAMAN 🔥🔥🔥
I would love to see a Call of Duty zombies episode
yes yes yes yes
CROSS FIYAHHHHHHH!!!!!
If capcom is here, Devil May Cry might follow.
You had me at Armored Core and Unreal Tournament, my god
Love. Death. Robots. And video game characters (plus 40k)....peakkkkkkkk
YEAH UNREAL EDIT: oh my god its facing worlds
FOR THE EMPEROR!!
someone cooked here🔥
SPACE MARINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Warhammer 40k simplismente me deixou ansiosa pra krl
This is the smartest way to secretly pilot shows I've ever seen.
Is there destiny or am I just dumb
Somebody tell me that's not a T'au at 0:23, I don't want to get my hopes up
Okay, I know what I'll be resubbing in December. Super excited, for 40k!
kinda random but i feel like this is what What If should've been, different styles each episode and completely unconnected stories
1:26 Pac-Man being what looks to be a killer robot is something I didn’t expect but definitely something I want now 💯
Okay but why is CONCORD in the list of games exactly? A game that is neither "beloved" or "inspired". Talk about not fitting in.
“Love, death & robots” That’s all I needed to see. I can’t wait!
this video needs a <3 button, thumbs up is not enough
THATS RIGHT BOYYYYY MY GUY MEGA MAN IS IN THIS!!!
dammm yeah !!!
Stop trying to force concord
OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10/10 10/10 100/100 BEST SERIES! BEST SERIES!
Darth Plageus
Nerdgasm
Much can be said about prime... But F me sideways if it ain't worth it atm and becoming more worth it.... This is peak... Show us what you can do with the 40k universe - show Cavill what you can do... And let's rock this mother.
Banger, after banger. Meanwhile, concord snuck in and doesn't know it's in the wrong club.
Holly mother sssssssshhhhh……! 😳😱😱😱
Unreal Tournament ❤ ❤️ ❤️
That doesn't look anything like Armored Core. What is this Art Station bs?
Concord oof
Let’s fucking gooooo!!
This looks awesome I’m in
this looks very promising i think im going to like this one
Holy moly
Armored core episode more armored core more armored core armored core episode more armored core more armored corral
Wow I’m pumped. 40K and armored core. What a blessed time to be alive
I recognise that style of space msrines. So this is where the astarties new animation went. Cant wait to watch this alone.
Uh did anyone have this on their yearly bingo chart?
Absolute Cinema! I hope this truly kickstarts the Warhammer40k series!
40k!!!
Please don't screw it up with DEI. PLEASE don't screw it up with DEI.
0:59 goddamn. He smashed a car with his body
You had me at visionaries behind love death and robots
0:54 KEANU?!
Unreal Tournament!? Are you serious!? 🤯❤
LD+R and Ultramarines? FUCKEN GIMME!
Does this mean that the creators of love death and robots have left Netflix- and there won't be a new season - I thought season 4 was already announced?
Epic as hell, now this looks awesome!!!
My pants are so wet right now
WARHAMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAR 😛😛😛❤️
WAIT WAIT... I get both Armored Core AND Unreal Tournament in this anthology?! What did I do to deserve this glorious series?! I'm so stoked right now!
....MEGA MAN?!?!?!?!?!?!? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Is that Keanu Reeves at about 54 seconds in?
Where’s Samus
This call goes out to every Lynx and Raven out there. Get ready to activate combat mode.
Does it happen that the unchosen ones just accidentally open a door type shi
UNREAL TOURNAMENT ACKNOWLEDGED
Right now I can say amazon is getting  better than Netflix
"From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots..." Me: Okay... Another anthology series... "...15 Stories inspired by your favorite games..." Me: WAIT WHAT!!! *Repeats this video again* NO WAY! *Reveals every title* Me: 😲😲😲 NO WAY!!! NEW ANTHOLOGY SERIES FEATURING OUR FAVORITE GAMES!!! LET'S GO!!!
This looks so fucking cool. It’s like having a wow, warhammer level cinematic episode for a bunch of beloved games…… and then there is also concord
1:12 someone got to let Vaati know
Basically the cutscenes during a video game...I'll take it some games have better animation during their cutscene than their gameplay 😂
Thought Pac was a phantasm orb for a sec
why tf is no one mentioning the fact that keanu reeves is doing the armored core episode 😭
You had me at the mother f***in' GOD OF WAR!
I am PRAYING the 40k Episode is made by the same guy that made Astartes, I desperately want more of his work!
you had me at 40k, lets go!
I SAW GOD OF WAR!!!!!!!! *dancing*
A PlayStation anthology series sign me up 🎮
Armored Core? I'd have hyped for an actual soulsborne but Armored Core ... ? Probably gonna be good anyway tho ...
They put fucking concord and crossfire as refrences but not life is strange, detroit, or even the last of us. Lol, lmao even. Regardless theres kratos and 40k in it so it'll be a banger.
God of War and 40k? Keeping my Prime sub
0:59 FOR THE EMPEROR!!
Kratos looks like he's in a modern day city.
Concord... oh no
Please put Disney out of business
e não tem dark souls
The fact that this is by the LDR people already gives me so much hope. That show is a masterpiece of anthology storytelling
my first 2 seconds im pression was - its going to be love death and robots
Keanu Reeves at 00:51? Also what game is that based on?
WARHAMMER CONTENT! WARHAMMER CONTENT!
I recently saw the trailer for the new Wizard of Oz spinoff prequel movie and I noticed just how dull the CGI looked because it looks like every CGI blockbuster. Then I watched this and thought, that if they made more animated films, like this, which looks absolutely gorgeous, they could be massive hits.
“Concord” 💀💀💀
0:49 KRATOS Dayum
Need dat
Words cannot EXPRESS how thankful and excited I am for this,love death and robots was a beautiful series when it was on Netflix and id been waiting for a new installment for yrs,and now they're doing another...but with GAMES??? I'm in.
..... Darth Plagueis?
Can’t wait till December!!! God Of War, Space Marine 2, Sifu, Megaman…someone give me a Time Machine!!!
Did anyone else think the thumbnail was darth plagueis? 🤔
wtf is concord doing there? u chose that over other amazing games .. interesting to say the least hh
I could've sworn I saw a character who looked like Kratos for a brief second. I'm really looking forward to this series.
"Inspired by your favorite games"  CONCORD 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait.. Spelunky will have one episode dedicated to it??? Please tell me there's going to be a S2 and The Binding of Isaac will have its own episode 🙏 😂
Mega Man....
did i see megaman and 40k? gonna be good
Wish this was in Netflix
Warhammer  ❤
Sifu seems like an unsuccessful title that is out of place with all these heavy and fun hitters.
S-Spelunky?!? HUH?!
Oh my soy!
Pray to the.Emperor🙏🙏🙏
How should gaming series be adapted to movies. Like give me witcher in this quality with the story of books and im buying 80 copies myself
I cant fucking believe we are getting and Armored Core episode, i am sooooo happy.
SPELUNKY????
Let The Game Begin ⏳
THis looks fucking terrible
Sony un último intento por promocionar concord jajajaja, en fin, warhammer y armored core es lo que más me llamo la atención, ojalá que Sony no se haya pasado de tonto y haya dado permiso de usar bloodborne y demons souls, porque si se que queda en concord, lo único que era será que odiemos más ese juego
I am so here for this!!
what about beast games though? oh wait...
Seeing a space marine runing through a truck is s fcking tier
Please tell me 40k is done by Syama.
This is peak
FOR ULTRAMARINES! FOR THE IMPERIUM OF MAN!
SO Cool!!!
That is a space marine?!
Unreal Tournament ❤
Megaman!!!
PLEASE AMAZON, PEOPLE WILL PAY YOU LOTS OF MONEY IF YOU MAKE A DEDICATED W40K ANIMATED SERIES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STAY TRUE TO THE LORE AND YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO MAKE MILLIONS.
No, don't make me get hype again... not for Amazon, the harbingers of fail...
I wonder how they'll handle megaman...? That, and I hope they do an Ace Combat episode in a later season...
Concord? Wtf that failure of a dei pos
That's why it's taking so f*king long with LDR Volume 4!!  But I'll watch this new series even tho I'm not a gamer.  Knowing it's made by serious fans of these games I trust the visuals and storytelling will be immaculate!
I wish Titanfall was in this antology
The Space Marine body-checking a car is what has convinced me to watch this.
What if we turn Fortnite into a series? this is the most corporate slop I've seen in ages sine Ready player one.
GHOST OF TSUSHIMA???? YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RELEASE THE HYPE ENGINE 😎
1:13 Tiamat!? Oh this is gonna be good.
ok.
They just got themselves a new customer
Armored core fans unite. This trailer just cooked me so hard.
Est ce que c'était bien un chasseur jackal dans un des plan? Enfin un hommage a Infinite warfare ?! 8D
MEGA MAN!!!!!!!!!!!
Armored Core and Sifu. Jesus Christ, this is insane
KEANU REEVES PILOTS A ARMORED CORE??!!!
Unreal Tournament? GODLIKE!!
Love, Death and Robots
MEGAMAN!!!!! SUPA FIGHTING ROBOT!!!!!
The animation looks Solid and if they can tell the stories right it will be awesome,  but some of the games they chose do not add up with the "Most Beloved Games" category,  such as Concord.  The game is not even out yet and reviews from the beta's are very subpar.
Mega Man, PAC-MAN, God of War, Ghosts of Tsushima, SIFU, Warhammer, Armored Core, Dungeons & Dragons, and many more! My fellow Gamers around the world! WE WON!
megaman ftw
I need greedy corporations to stop touching my childhood.
Finally someone expanded on the Pong universe. I've been waiting over forty years
Lol Concord is gonna be dead and the studio shut down before their episode even releases.
0:34 look keanu reeves?
It looks  cool, hopefully there is substance beneath that veneer.
Have no words to describe how good it looks. Thank you @PrimeVideo ❤
SPELUNKY MENTIONED RAHHH 🗣🗣‼️🔥 WTF IS A ROPE
"From the visionaries of Love Death Robots"  I'm in. That's all I needed to know
So you’re telling me a show that’s based around different video game legends from PlayStation to Xbox ?  Yeah needless to say this show is gonna blow the socks off of everyone and a 2nd season is gonna be a must.   Gonna keep my ears to the ground about this new tv series shame it’s tied to Prime tho
More Warhammer 🎉
Yes papi! 😍
I know only Cyberpunk and it's enough to make me hyped, but I hoped portal or half-life was there
HWOAKRHEOMWLQP
"Favorite games" but I don't see DRIVER!
I didn't see Destiny but I think I saw Concord mentioned. That game isn't out, how is it anyone's favourite?
I have never felt so mis-lead in my life. I saw tau in the thumbnail astartes in the opening scenes.... and its all just gaming stuff? I thought this was something 40k related.
Wow, Amazon is really killing it…self. I am still sure this will be not as soulless and bad as what they did to Tolkien. Just as generic.
simplesmente foda!
Omg… short films on all those games!?
It's so beautiful...
Looks good. I wonder how long it will take them to announce its been cancelled after the first season airs?
I'd love to see freespace
I mean, this is awesome!
this is the reason i’ll finally get prime
If they make more seasons of this, PLEASE, make a Dead Space episode please please please!!
Why is kratos in a modern city?!
Looks like absolute trash
LD+R was soooooo good. This is about to be amazing
I started armoring my core when I saw Armored Core
What we gamers have been waiting for decades, maybe since the first wow cinematic or Warcraft 3. That they actually do full stories with that quality
Really hoping this is slightly less gory than Love+Death+Robots.. incredible animation I wanted to get into LDR so bad but the insane amount of gore on a lot of the episodes put me off.
Was that fucking Jin Sakai I sneakily saw there 😮
Well hell yeah, from Amazon WTF.  Okay.
This is a big gift for gamers!! But i wait that this not means that Love Death And Robot will stay from side...
This looks like its from a starset music video
Spelunky?!?! Never in a million years would I have guessed.
Rare Amazon W with the 40K tease
And then theres Concord😂
man a halo reach one like those old cinematic trailers would of been peak, but armored core and 40k is awesome
Wow. An anthology series about our favorite games!? Why wasn't this a idea before!?
Actual respect for the games and their audiences? What is this crap?
I have never been this goose bumped in such a short amount of time
I have watched this trailer 5 times already. Had to watch a 0.25x speed because there so much detail going on and it's absolutely insane.
Nice
Amazing idea! Also a great way to test out what could be extended into a longer format. Deadpool's "leaked" test footage was practically a short film
Brilliant
Wish they added rdr2 aswell
Who is the character at 0:23?
YES YES YES BRING ME MORE
WOWWWWW se ve espectacular W40K
40K Space marines- YES! Love, Death and Robots- YES! This trailer looks bloody amazing! I am very, VERY excited for this show 🤟💀
Ghost of Tsushima 🔥🔥🔥
Megaman cutscenes makes my nostalgia tingle.
Ultramarines of course.
We are the Emperor’s angels of death, not his angels of mercy.
Hyped for 40k, Sifu, and ArmCore!
Drop the concord and we will be more happy to subscribe
Yes fkn please and thank you
December?! Ughhh
Legit if they do a season two and have halo in it ill be super happy
LOVE, DEATH, & VIDEO GAMES
Thank you <3
Alv
I see Megaman, I lock ALL the way in!
i thought this was a movie trailer
Marvel: we have the most ambitious crossover in history.  Prime: Hold my Astartes!
Cool
Ok i'm in
HOLY SHIT HIGH FIDELITY SPACE MARINES
I can't wait I feel called
Omg 😱 it’s Kratos ❤
Eeem I don’t understand what is this. New games, nev series- what?
I fought the trailer was for a Warhammer 40K animated series 😂
And here I thought there was going to be a video game... In any case, Gamescom came out with all of these "Coming soon in 2025" games with no definitive release date and I think back to 2022 and how Build A Rocket Boy's "Everywhere" is still yet to be released. Where can I buy "Everywhere"? Oh, that's right, it isn't available yet...
I was not prepared
Ok, Im so ready for this. ❤❤❤
UNREAL TOURNAMENT
40k, are you kidding! Omg i can't wait!!!!!!
Can’t wait❤
MegaMan and God of War!!!! Im love it already!!!!!
Mega Man, 40K, D&D!!! what the hell!!!
I didn't expect to see Honor of kings
warhameeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
I’m looking forward to this rise up gamers 😃
Looks dope af
The Emperor protects.
Armored Core fans we're eating good tonight!
Could’ve sworn I saw Master Chiefs helmet….?!
I havent been this excited since the day i won my first match of 40k
Agora vocês tem a minha atenção!
Warhammer ❤
It must have been an actual nightmare to convince all these IP holders to do this. But bless whoever pulled this together. We all live in the same world and love the same stuff and the little fiefdoms of corporations be damned.
armored core, wahammer 40k and megaman, looks like I'll have to buy a subscription to amazon prime video, XD
Spelunky episode let’s go !!!
Wth this looks epic
S P E L U N K Y
December 10th? What a nice birthday gift!
Mid
ARMORED CORE!!!!!!!!!
Bro how much did Sony paid to put Concord in this bro actually though they in the team lmao 😂😂😂
Holy shit this looks fuckin epic
dangit,seems either one cannot watch it outside US
Everyone: "These game cinematics looks so good, they should make make them into a show."  Blur Studio: "Hold my beer!"
How the hell is the protagonist going to survive Spelunky?
So instead of botching one IP at a time, they've moved on to screwing up 15 at a time? Thanks Amazon, love the work you do!
Just stick to the lore Amazon don't try to fix what's already perfect
For the emperor
MEGAMAN
Hombre... entiendo que muchos pueden ser de nicho y no se tocan por nada (ya sabes, DnD, Warhammer 40K, Megaman/Rockman, Armored Core, incluso God of War...) y eso te los respeto y se los agradeceré siempre.  Pero... ¿me estás diciendo que, teniendo esta oportunidad a saber si única en la vida, dejaron de lado "Bioshock"?  (inhala y exhala buscando la calma, con cierto éxito)  ¿Por qué dejaron de lado ésa oportunidad?  ...  En fin, saludos a todos en el vasto Internet.
0:49 Kratos in the modern times?
Just here to see warhammer 40k
for those curious about the rapid fire logos Warhammer Unreal Tournament New World Aeternum Playstation Dungeons & Dragons The Outer Worlds 2 Pac-Man Honor of Kings Armored Core Megaman Exodus Spelunkey CrossFire Concord Sifu
Amazon, you have my attention.
Let them cook with armored core
Oh boy! I wish Battletech got a look in though
Words cannot describe how *mind-blowing* this is. The inner child in me is beyond exploding with excitement.
This is too good! Love, Death + Robots was outstanding. Can't wait!!
Wow....was that Pacman?
SPELUNKYSPELUNKYSPELUNKYSPELUNKYSPELUNKY
cant wait this is peak
A space marine kratos and Sifu walk into a Amazon series
I'm happy you guys are ewxcited for this, but it's not for me. How about take any of these properties and use them to create a show about that property. Why are we taking all these beloved things and mashing them into one? It's not cool. It just makes me pine for actual content.
V is that you ?
How much you wanna bet the PAC-MAN segment is yet another "what if pacman was EVIL... AND ATE YOU!!!!!!!!" deal
Some of these are gonna be awful I can tell. Also why the fk is Concord there? Literally nobody likes it, and nobody played it during its FREE TO PLAY open Beta.
I am begging, keep cooking
What is the Love, Death and Robots is going on here, I Love it.
0:47 Mega Man my beloved ...
Holy shit, December?? Omg PLEASE let this start a Wave of announcing things that aren't THREE OR FOUR YEARS AWAY. This is awesome, definitely checking it out.
The fact that Concord is included as a "favorite" game is such a joke lmao
I’m about to bust
Hell yes. Nice to see them including 40k in there.
I have no idea what this is but I’m intrigued! Definitely will be watching.
Gamers assembled 🎮🕹
Capcom will make every weird crossover before making a new Mega Man game
This looks very cool! I love this so much as a lifelong Weeb and gaming nerd! I can't wait until December!
For the Emporer!
No dire nada, parece prometedor, veremos que "aporta" esta nueva serie.
This is so fucking good
why does it have to be on prime...ugh
Yo this looks awesome, I can’t wait to watch this
Why waste an episode on Concord though?
I think this is just a bunch of pilots to see what people like most to turn into full series xD
the blue bomber is fucking back lets go!
Bro, yes!!!!
Spelunky and Sifu mentioned, peak confirmed
ASTAAAAAARTEEEEES
hoping one day, DREDGE  will be a part of this
I'm just hyped for Spelunky! Let's go!
whoever made this trailer must have the reading speed of a GOD!
Ok I might check this out for the space marines, kratos, and armored core.
FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!!!!
No Team Fortress 2? I’m good.
MEGAMAN LET'S GOOOOOOOO
OHHHHH SIIIIII MEGAMAN !!!!!!!
OH MY FUCKING GOD YES!!!!!!  Seems like some executiv ACTUALLY though about what the public might enjoy. This is an incredible idea!  And if THAT isn't proof enough that 40k deserves a 3D ANIMATED series, even after all the work guys like Astartes did, then it just isn't meant to be.
Okay I will renew my prime subscription just for this.  Still don't forgive you for the ROP and WOT. You still suck duck.
😲😲😲
This is going to be amazing
GOD BLESS BLUR, please hire me 😂
Can't wait to see Kratos!!!
I’m going to have play all these games again dangit
FOR THE EMPEROR
Wait so its not even gonna be a full 40k show?
Some one is cooking. 40k . G.o.d . Armored core.  This much Hips is not good for my heart
MEGAMAN 😭😭😭 WE STILL LOVE YOU! YOU STILL MATTER!
Excited for the Armored Core short alone.  Do Ace Combat for Season 2 and I might implode with inner fanboyism.
I wish they did the diablo 2 secret cow level.
Why does William Afton have no nose?
Hopefully they hired the guy who made Astartes
fuckin' MEGA MAN?!
Hyppeeee
0:49 KRATOS!?
Sometimes the most popular things aren't that good which is very sus but this looks good
FINALLY WE WILL HAVE MORE STORIES TO ENRICH THE DEEP AND BELOVED LORE OF FUCKING PAC-MAN WOW
They all look badass. Emperor protects
Looking forward to seeing MegaMan
my dopamine got destroyed by just watching this 💀💀💀
So it begins.
Keanu Reeves?
This might fucking change the gaming industry
Bro, I've been screaming that games like Borderlands need short L+D+R-style anthologies instead of big adaptations for weeks now!
Yo my shlong just got so hard lol
I think I peed myself a little.
omg what
Between all the big names they also add Concord, I hope than the 3 Concord fans out there are excited too.
00:50 GHOST OF TSUSHIMA ⚔️. They better not mess this up.
MEGAMAN!!!!!!!
no destiny :(
was Kratos in the middle of a city block!
All those moments. Will be lost. Like tears, in rain.
Concord LOL
DEAD. ON. THE. MOON!!!
Sooooo, Love, Death & Robots? How exciting Il pay 5 different streaming services, to watch 5 exactly same ideas on them...
WHAT THE, ARMORED CORE??? THE HELL??? YESS
Why is Darth plagueis in here?
Sifu is gonna go crazy
This image is pac man 🤯 0:24
UNREAL TOURNAMENT, LADS...  IT'S FUCKING UNREAL TOURNAMENT  GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Ummmm.... YES!!!! Need i say more!?!?!?!
Armored core and spacemarine actuall peak entertainment
For the Emperor I will subscribe to Prime Video again!
this is so good
Someone plz tell me the Astartes dude had something to do with the warhammer one
This looks amazing
40k, D&D, Outer Worlds, God of War, and maybe Sifu should all be interesting. The rest.. we'll see I guess
UNREAL TOURNAMENT ????!!
Im actually pretty stoked for this!!
MEGAMAN?!!! Esto no me lo pierdo
They tried sneaking in Concord! 😂
That is definitely Mega man at 0:47. can't mistake those boots and buster canon anywhere.
Turns out WE are live in alternate Universe
MEGAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
This is looking great
Does this reminda anyone of Saturday Supercade? And does anyone actually know what that is?
amazon is on a role of cranking out great tv shows, from invincible, the boys, fallout, and now this! I can't wait to see what else they're cooking.
No dota?
omg guys we GAMING
Why does actually look peak? Visuals are insane
40K!!!!!!!!!!! 😆
Unreal Tournament!?
Armored Core... I will watch that no matter the price.
We spelunkin 🔥
Okay but SPELUNKY???
I’m very Excited🔥
None of those games are my favorite, but it looks AMAZING! Cant wait to see!
Outer worlds 2? Thats not even out yet lol
HOLY SHIT IS THAT MEGAMAN??? RAHHHHHHHH 🦅🦅🦅⚡️SUPER FUCKING FIGHTING ROBOT MEGAFUCKIN MAN
It’s all fun and games until you have 7 foot 400 pound genetic super soldiers dragging a coffin across the universe.  Hopefully Cavil can get his live action product done!
BOI
40k? Sign me up because that looks good
At first I thought… woah! Whats Darth Plagueis is doing in Prime Vídeo?!?!
What is this
HOW could they leave out Horizon and Aloy???
Never in a thousand years would I have guessed there'd be an Amazon Prime Spelunky show
Don't...Don't give me hope
Having Armored Core going from such a niche franchise in the west to this is actually crazy, looking so forward this.
Another one of them chosen one movies
I hope season 2 brings Elden Ring
Kratos in a modern city? You better not butcher our boy.
Hope we get Mass Effect if they decide to do a second run of this. This is so cool!
I don't know what this is but I'm strangely drawn to it 😯
No destiny? The lore is literally the games strongest point. Couldve made something incredible. Parsons probably fired the team who was working with amazon though
See a scene of someone getting their soul sucked out is that a metaphor for what amazon intends to do to gaming just like LOTR.😂
I’m actively crying
We need the Warhammer40k Serie.
looks incredible
wut ?!
SPELUNKY EPISODE ??!
MEGAMAN?!?!
MEGA MAN
hyped for this xD
Vamoooossss
Holy crap!! I can't wait!
hell yeah
hypeee
"All those moments" they are some of my most cherished memories. This is an incredible idea
I am horrified and hopeful that 40k will see a screen done by amazon
What I am watching, kratos in a dead actual city with hanz zimmer music???
Honor of Kings! 🔥🔥🔥
No Cyberpunk 2077?!? WTAF? Easily wouldve been one of the best. Guessing Netflix locked that down though, so... maybe it makes sense why its not here. Shame though...
And they've got Idris Elba as one of the space marines
Warhammer 40k!!!!!!  Dont butcher the lore plzzzz
Let's see if we know that Megaman will be there, I'll believe them. But Pac man? Reminds me of that live action Pac Man fan made
It was about time to do something useful with Megaman
woof this gonna be FIRE!!!!!
I see Kratos. I'm going to watch.
I really hope that at 0:53 is V from cyberpunk
This doesn't immediately scream "cash grab". I'm cautiously optimistic.
Holy sh*t I'm about to have a nerdgasm
looks pretty dope
SIFUUUUUUUUUU
man this looks sick!  im hyped lol
I wish Halo was included. We really need a win rn
MEGA MAN‼️
0:47 is that megaman?! Please let it be X not megaman
Por el emperador llego el dia hermanos ❤
HI, AS THE REPRESENTIVE FOR MEGAMAN FANS IN ARGENTINA (it's just me) HOLY SHIT A MEGAMAN ANIMATION IS COMING?=
40K and AC. This can’t be real life
The Codex Astartes does support this action.
Oh hell yeah this is great
You know, if we can’t get a Mega Man movie then this series might be fine enough for me… for now
Prime. You got me.
40k I actually just busted
The 4 whole frames of Spelunky in this trailer were hype
What is this movie even about?
Hyped for Unreal Tournament.
Megaman? wow
0:47 Megaman... Its Megaman... ITS MEGAMAN
These guys are so talented and visionary, that based on what I'm seeing here, especially the Pac-Man one, these guys could probably do Bomberman in a style similar to Act Zero, and have it actually work.
HOLY EMPEROR
THIS IS IT ! WARHAMMER 40K  IS COMING !!!
Looks too diverse for my taste. Enjoy
Holy shit it's actually happening Praise Henry Canvil
"From the creative minds behind LOVE, DEATH + ROBOTS", WOW! More of this type of style, i like
Those space Marines actually looked.... Good???
Inject this directly into my veins
This is awesome but put Elden Ring on the list for sequel pleaaaaase ahhhhhhh
HYPE HYPE HYPE
Cool!
AI MEU DEUS MEGA MAN
YEEEEESSSSSS YEEEEESSSSSS MEGAMAAAAAAAAAAN‼️💥💥💥💥💥
I'm hype asf
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE SPELUNKY SHORT!!
give me the nali war cow please
Lol. That death machine Pacman
Megaman, Armored Core, D&D, FRICKING 40k, EVEN SIFU, all organized and created by the same people or similar elements as Love, Death, and Robots.....  THIS IS GONNA BE FIRE!
Masterpiece?
Well, let's hope Amazon doesn't eff this up like they did with their WH40K show. I hope Cavill can rescue this project.
40k ALONE would be amazing. I am very much looking forward to this
0:23 bro looks like Darth Plagueis the wise
Am i the only one,who is disappointed,because i was expecting a whole live-action serie for every game?
Fucking Armored Core, God of War and Warhammer 40k Now we are talking.
KRATOS ????
DUDE UNREAL TOURNAMENT, they hit me right in the heart of my childhood
Ready player two??!?!?!?
Kratos and Jin Sakai hype me so much! I hope this trend of video games adaptations will go on!
LOVE THIS!!!!!
"From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots". Say no more, I'm in.
I'm so surprised crossfire reached here, but my young inner self is happier than ever, that game is my childhood 😬
Thanks to Blur, Amazon get something right for once.
THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP THUMBS UP
phantasm murder ball at the end there, i wonder how many old farts like me got it
Why the hell is this anthology serie with 15 Stories?? Why don't you make a whole Serie from every stroy? It is redicilious ,that the most iconic charachter like Kratos has only one Episode or something like that!!!!!!!
UNREAL TOURNAMENT
Duuuuuuuuuuude this looooks so fucking goood
Amazon doing space marines Henry cavil space marine franchise might be coming closer and closer!!
Hold up    ...Mega Man?
DEAD SPAAACEE
This. Looks. Amazing.
HALF LIIIIIIFEE
0:53 Keane Reeves?
Why... WHY DID I SEE CONCORD in the lineup?!
the light of the Astronomican shines once more, Astartes has returned. Tremble before the majesty of The Emperor, for we all walk in His immortal shadow!
where is Arthur Morgan?????* he is the best character in the game world i love him so much please guys add arthur morgan and duthc van der lemon
You had me at Love Death and Robots
Десантники :  Братья, нам понадобится ООЧЕНЬ большой зал для тврафееф
so Ready Player One but video games only? 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Just don't take off the master chief helmet.
I saw Kratos!!!!
Yo, I'm gonna need that last frame from the AC clip at 0:46 as a background for my PC or something asap
AMAZING IDEIA
40k in a Series with big budget lets goooo
This looks sick
MEGA MAN!
I for one do not want to go on an isekai adventure in Warhammer 40k
now they got my heart
MEGA MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Armored Core, Megaman, 40K, Unreal Tournament, and D&D....  WHAT MORE COULD WE ASK FOR?!?!?
Kratos is in this!?!? Oh heavens… I’m tuning in
Ready player two
Very interesting choices here. Finally seeing 40K stuff is worth it on its own but Unreal Tournanent and Armored Core? Spelunky? Fucking MEGAMAN?? Yeah, this is hype.
Yes, love it!
I almost cried. It will be something like Player One maybe becouse of many games and memories in one but better.
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED!!! WTF IS A BAD MECH GAME?!?!?!🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
I CANT BELIEVE IT
0:59. !mega man!, the súper fightin   robot !mega man! To the save of the world
Long ago ,the Emperor of Mankind foresaw Humanity’s need for warriors unlike any other. Warriors who could face the unbearable horrors lurking among the stars. Warriors who on the day of certain defeat, would rise victorious.
Warhammer 40.000 animation on Prime? This awesome?! Can't wait for December!
This is what gaming needs to transcend it's own medium.
YESSSS! ALL OF THE CINEMATIC SCENES IN THE GAMES ARE FINALLY GONNA HAVE ITS OWN STORIES! DOTA PLEASEEEE!
Crazy Netflix didnt lock down this team
WHAT ARE YOU COOKING AMAZON!!??!!!
Was really hoping Destiny would have got a look in there. The Devil's Lair strike would make a great episode.
I am going in for the 40k and armored core episode, that is my shit
Character lineup looks like a Fortnite lobby
@0:51 Was tha Keanu Reeves!?
I’m so grateful right now
Love Death and Robots, sign me up immediately
So its ready player one?
a bold move cotton but an interesting one for sure
SPELUNKY
Bro super hyped! I wonder how much gpu card and time it took to make this series, the graphics look insane —future is here
YES! This is what we want!!!
For the Emperor!
wa chabal en plan omaigad
uh this looks so dope wtf
Honor Of Kings ❤
Hope this gains traction and somehow get Nintendo to include their IPs
Let's hope Tim Miller doesn't ruin it like with Terminator
Prime actually doing something cool for once, Can't wait for the 40k episode!
Who cares about Warhammer and armored core, I wanted Shadow of the Colossus, Sly Cooper Jak and Daxter
Guys, the Pac is actually back
Well that looks fucking good.
*1:15** CONCORD!! NO!!! They pulled us in with space marines then snuck that DEI game Concord in!!!   Hi asmongold 👋*
Like 30 mins ago i finished the story of Ghost of Tsushima, and now I‘m seeing Jin Sakai in this trailer! Im beyond hyped
Concord😂😂😂😂😂😂
Amazons version of Love Death + Robots kind of? im for it
CGI trash
Warhammer Unreal Tournament New World Aeternum God of War Ghost of Tsushima Destiny ? Dungeons & Dragons The Outer Worlds 2 Pac-Man Honor of Kings Armored Core Megaman Exodus Spelunky Crossfire Concord Sifu
Not only yes but HELL YES 1000%
From the creators of Zima blue!!
Fckin gimme
“Spectacular give me 15 of them”
Megaman, MEFAMAN IS LIVE.
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
The goosebumps of watching this... I can see why Tim Miller was so emotional. So cute.  Congrats! Im excited to watch this!
If they decide to animate Castlevania like Metal Gear, they surely have my subscription, so when it comes out I will see Megaman. 🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰
That is how you make a trailer!
Yo the hype…wow
omg UT omg omg
So, it's official game fanfics?
Idris Elba with service studs perhaps? 0:22
Please, please, please be as awesome as the trailer makes it look.
Really hoping every episode is longer 5-20 mins each Love Death Robots eps are.
Praise be the Emperor of man kind!
nah, this is peak
Unironically the coolest announcement I've seen in years. I so hope this gets a greenlight for a second season for more just like this. Genius idea.
MEGA MAN!? KRATOS!?!
OMGGGGG YEEESSSS
PLEASE USE ORIGINAL ACTORS!!! GOD THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING EVER
toma mi malddddttttoooo dinero prime
God of War, Sifu, Ghost of Tsuhima, Warhammer 40k, Armored Core! What else is in this series!? 😮
Pish.
YES MEGAMAN!!!
Finally something original
This feels like a sequel to Ready Player One with this many IP in the series!
I'm only here for the 40k.
Fucking Tiamat?! Oh hell yeah!
yissss
If this gets a second season (dear god please let it) they NEED to do a Doom story that shows how the slayer got his floating ship in eternal which was planned and scrapped as a dlc. Shit would be PEAKKK
SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT! MEGA MAN!
omfg amazing
¿Darth Plagueis?.
Yooo I was not expecting this 😮
All i can say is respect the source material, respect your customer and everything will be great!
TIME TO GET HYPED, BOYS!
I never would have thought there would be a tv show with Mega Man, Kratos, Space Marines, and Pac Man all in one, but I’m glad it’s happening.
Armored Core Lets fucking gooooooooooooooooooooooooo 621
Ready Player Two starring Darth Plagueis the Wise.
Concord & epic story? pffft
Don- don’t fug this up. But it looks good.
1:00 1:16 beautiful simply beautiful, beautiful thing, well done thing
Let's go KRATOS !!!!!
"BOY!" intensifies.
Finally LDAR format going back
Oh my god
How has everyone missed ghost of Tsushima…. Jin Sakai clear as day throughout the trailer
Mega Man
Its like Wreck It Ralph for Grown Ups
CONCORD LOL
Cant wait to see Cortana's Viddies on Prime
0:50 Kratos standing in the middle of the street, surrounded by cars and buildings. Can't wait to see what's going on here.
2 years ago, Armored Core was a dead franchise. Now we get a new game AND an adaptation, I think we Ravens have won.
Giving Games Workshop the Prime title card reveal is a big statement. Very excite.
Warhammer and armored core got me at full mast
Is that KRATOS??
Jogo ou série?
Bring it on😬
Amazon, i hope your happy, you just made millions of gamers sqert themselves with joy, you guys won the internet!
Give me some Portal and Crypt of the Necrodancer next!
Armored core is going to get an animated episode made by one of the most innovative teams in animation today.  I’m dreaming GTFO.
90s gamers are today 40s+ serious people also creators and artists and when they do this instead of stuff for normies non gamers - I love it! I always though Unreal Tournament needed some more attention and love in other media
More self-insert pandering? If this bombs, the backlash for AAA is going to be massive to a point of no-recovery.
I Dreamt Of A Strange & Unjust World
Ayo, KRATOS?
ХУ Е ТА
Can't wait to see the enter the gunge on based epidose
I’ve been begging for something like this for years
So this is kinda like the same format as "Love, death and robots" but for video games? That's fucking genius, looking forward to this!
"adult-animated" - glad you didn't get kids to do it.
bruh who TF invited concord LOL
Got a job for you, 621...
SIFU BABY
Warhammer!!❤❤
My, the new Captain N reboot looks WILD
You should probably cancel that concord episode while you still have the chance
Better version of Death, Love, Robot + Ready P.1
I feel like this is either going to be the lamest or coolest thing I see this year, no in between. Here's hoping...
0:53 i swear that is keanu reeves
This is the best thing to ever happen this year! I AM SO PUMPED UP!!!
It’s beautiful. 🥹
0:18 say less ,I'm ready  Wait 0:49 was that Kratos
This looks dope
"concord" one of these is not like the other
I want this at 1000%
Yoooo cant wait for this!! We need something like this for warhammer fantasy
Concord? 😂😂😂
I love this
Please doing ruin this Amazon.
Next time turn up the generic Trailer drum sample, I could almost hear the sound of the dialogue.
Concord being featured will be the biggest marketing piece for the game, because rn the devs aren't doing so hot 😂
Ready Player One spin off?
This makes me so happy
Dude seeing the Armoured Core stuff instantly kicked in the hype. Hopefully it's good. So much potential in all of them. AC and 40K definitely the 2 I'm most curious about though.
Ok...you got all my attention....
Meh none of these episodes are from games I enjoy. But I really hope this takes off and goes somewhere. I'll be skipping this however.
0:56 man I was hoping for some Cyberpunk.. 0:41 or is it?
WARHAMMER
Please let Kota Hoshino do the ost for the Armored core episode.
Is ghost in this collection ????? Cuz I wanna see
looks interesting. I'll definitely take a look.
UNREAL TOURNAMENT ????? NO FUCKING WAY LETSGOOOO
Did I just see fucking Keanu Reeves in an Armored Core???
Would’ve loved to see more 40k in the trailer, stoked for this thi
Armored Core ??????
The Emperor Protects! This looks amazing!
Darth Plagueus on Prime? Glad they saved you from The Acolyte.
Would've loved more varied visual styles for each game, but if good movies or tv shows come out of this for each franchise its worth it.
A Darksiders episode would be a dream come true for me
We are getting Amazon 40k animations before Astartes 2
01:16 Nice i saw Concord in there. Im curious about the lore in that game.
Mega Man, Kratos and Jin Sakai! WOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAH! ALL ABOOOOOOOOOOOOARD!
NO WAY ARMORED CORE
Eww
SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT
What the f.. is concord doing there 😅😅
Dear Lord... no idea this exists and WHAM. Tim Miller is my spirit animal.
Warhammer, lets fucking go.
They should make destiny series as well.
Um Love Death + Robots de videogames quase tive um treco. hype, hype, hype
Warhammer, finally!!!! <3
Wow, this should be great!
I hope Bioshock makes it in here
By 2026 Amazon Prime is gonna take over the streaming business
Blur STUDIOS IS THE BOMB BABY!!!
Imma call it now. This is gonna be the best show of the year.
Idk
SPELUNKY FANS RALLY UP!
Love death and robots was peak
Armoured Core, Warhammer 40k, Sifu, Ghost of Tsushima, Cyberpunk (I think?), God of War.... this might be the best thing to come out of Prime Video
No Starcraft?
Was that titanfall!?
this is going to be great!
holy shit, that looks fantastic
I don’t understand why did they not use Aquafina to voice this? She’s the greatest actress we have in the world right now. Lol
Waited we have indeed.
Subscribed in december
I cant wait to see d&d in this!
Insane
ARMORED CORE LETS FUCKING GO RUSTY
I dunno how anyone could be inspired by something as bland and generic as Concord, particularly considering it's mot even out yet. That's gotta be paid for by Sony.
Blud Looks like Darth Plagueis 😂
This looks fucking PEAK.
FOR THE EMPEROR!
Looks awesome but what the heck no Halo?
Games/Studios: Warhammer 40K Unreal Tournament New World: Aeternum PlayStation Dungeons & Dragons The Outer Worlds 2 PAC-MAN Honor of Kings Armored Core Mega Man Exodus Spelunky Crossfire Concord SIFU  You’re welcome 🤙🏻❤️
Hype
On one hand, unreal tournament, mega man, 40k, and armored core... but on the other hand, *concord.* ALMOST peak. If they cut shitcord out of there and replace it with something like Monster Hunter or Deep Rock it'll be beyond perfect. Hell, even overwatch would be better than concord.
For the Emperor
Surprised games workshop signed off on something good to be made.
"15 stories inspired by your favourite games"  > Shows Concord
Those space marine scenes low keys look like a sequel to Astartes. Crossing fingers it's the same guy in his official GW capacity.
Lo mejor del evento y de esta teoría van a salir más ideas
Megaman fans out here starving, FINALLY, SOME FOOD.
Blur Studio popped off
This is like the sequel to ready player one but as a series
Wtf Spelunky is a Nice surprise lol
Hell yes!!!
Oh my goodness yes to all of this.  I want all of it now
Will watch it just for warhammer hope they do it justice.
Uhhh... Concord?
@classicmand I'm hype how about  you
Ultramarines 🔥🔥🔥
Omfg
Ya se cuando pagarme prime video
Death robot chicken as creators ik it won't disappoint
FUCKING UNREAL TOURNAMENT
This will be so sick. Wish overwatch was there too
I am watching this . I love creative mind behind love, death, robots but this time with your favorite games yessir ... hope its good
Sony/Bungie, take heed.... you should be teaming up with these people to bring a Destiny series to life.
Wait… crossfire? The old free 2 play shooter? CS:GO would be more interesting than the pay 2 win crossfire shooter 😂
BROOOOO como ansio verla, como desearia encontrar una Historia de ELDEN RING
Better than live action. Can't wait to see it come out.
By the Emperor of mankind am I dreaming? A full on animated series with Amazon level of budget and done with the people of love, death and robot? Now this is how you gain some attention
Wait holy frick this is legendary. Something like this from the creators of Love Death Robots?!? This wasn’t on any sort of bingo card but this is actually such a dream come true.
All of my yesses
So Hyped!!!!! We need more of those!! :D
We're gonna get to see the pilots from armored core??? daaaang son. Also, warhammer 40k. This is so peak.
ARMORED CORE!? LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!!
Everyone sleeping on the GOAT: Spelunky
Oh boy Amazon gets to speedrun ruining stuff
SPELUNKY?!
Count me iiiiiiiin!!🎉🎉❤
UNREAL TOURNAMENT??????
interesante perris, interesante...
I'm so fucking hard rn
Sheesh 🔥
UNREAL TOURNAMENT?! Just out of the blue when you can't even buy the games to play any more? ​Kind of adds to my theory that they'll add a UT to Fortnite at some point. Why else remove listings that make you money after all these years from people interested in arena shooters and game preservation?
ew, concord
Did I just see Kratos?
If only 40K gameplay was like the way it is portrayed here (a glimpse but we know what to expect) and in Astartes. Yes the new 40K space marine 2 is coming out but it does not give you that rush of unstoppable force and power like what you just saw.
no one talking about the concord inclusion. They really gambled on that one 💀
This is a great idea wtf
It was cabal from destiny 2 or im trippin?
Do not be crap!!
Kratos in a modern city? HELL FUCKING YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I hope there's a story set in a certain cursed city named Yharnam...
No way we are actually getting an Armored Core adaptation. 😢
FINALLY another anthology series but based on video games is sooooo sick. AND its by the love death robots team? Amazons got the best series available to date!
How did Netflix fumble this one lol
This is going to be amazing 🎉
Waiting to adapt Dead space
can't wait for the 40k
why not fortnite
👁️ 👄 👁️   A 40k episode made by the LD&R team? Hell yeah.
This looks epic
Oh man I really hope this gets massive success to spawn multiple seasons with other video games. I would love to see Halo and Doom get this animation treatment.
Ahh yes, long cinematics
can't wait for this new season of Love, Death + Robots
I love everything about this
This looks incredible
Videogame isekai
Amazon be amazing.
hypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhypedhyped
MY MAN KRATOS IS THERE!!!!
Outer worlds 2❤❤❤❤
OH MY GOSH! LETS GOOOOOOO
CONCORD???? SERIOUSLY??? lol I guess this was in the pipeline before it cratered.
SPELUNKY!!! LETS FUCKING RAGE!!!!! 🤪
Armored. Core.
Just want the 40k one, nothing else matters
Amazon... Don' you DARE (!) mess Warhammer up !
1:17  IS THAT BLOODBOURNE???
Spelunky FTW
Sploosh!
Concord... lmao yeah I know which episode everyone is skipping.
Kratos...in NY???
I wanna give in the the hype, but I’ve been burned before… I’ll hold my excitement, but stay hopeful
Concord. Lmaooooooo. Ain't nobody gonna watch that episode.
Quality of those scenes are like peak blizzard cinematics. I'm really excited for many of those titles!
NAH WE GOT GHOST OF TUSIMAAA
OMG OMG  MEGA-MAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!❤️🥺
Ok im hyped. Haven't had this feeling watching a trailer in a long while.
Pac Man?! Wish I saw that in the trailer. Wonder what kind of story you'll tell about Pac Man....
This is so insanely cracked. Kratos in a city as well? This is so hype. This is what everyone has been saying blizzard should be doing for years and prime finally did it themselves with better IP’s
this will be the best received piece of concord content to ever exist
This is crazy
Nioceeeeeeeee
The emperor protect!
Armored Core 😭😭😭
Is this a dream?
Why tf is concord here?!1:16
This is actually a hype idea.
Prime is literally just putting out bangers atm
If this will be  as good as "Love Deathe & Robots" i will be happy
0:19 Avatar?
It’s beautiful
UNREAL TOURNAMENT MENTIONED!!!!!!!!
Saw kratos
How many psykers do we have to sacrifice for a whole season of 40K animation like this?
YOOOO THE OUTER WORLDS 2 LET'S GOOOO
Mega MAN!!!
Meh.
"some of your favorite games" Concord literally released today.
Fast forwards immediately to the Warhammer 40k story...
F*ck yeah, this is a dream come true
Fincher never dissapoints
Concord? Seriously?
This is going to be amazing
This is such a smart corpo move. Not only did you put together something for everyone. You also basically have a bunch of test footage on your hands that you can gauge how the audience will react to so you know what projects to invest in the future.
Prime is teasing us with W40K , Cool i'm in
AMAZING!
You forgot City of Heroes, the greatest MMORPG ever created. Until then, I wait to be impressed.
this looks good. hope it runs it course and doesnt get cancelled
So, paid ads?
Ok amazon
YOOO MEGAMAN FINALLY
The quality of the cinematics is actually INSANE, I am so hyped!!!!
Mega man when the martial artist he’s shot to death gets back up:
0:51 Was that a ghost????
Feels almost too optimistic for the 40k setting🥸.
ARMORED CORE?!  HELL YES
Really my man this could be for a dark souls thing
MEGAMAAAAN
This pleases me and I hope this means we have more 40k to come.
1:02 IS THAT A FUCKING HELLDIVER? HIS STRATAGEMS ARE TOP RIGHT
This is going to be like CAPTAIN N The Game Master... But not locked to just NINTENDO GAMES & like 10,000% BETTER!!!
ARMORED CORE AND 40K!!!!! IS HEREEEEE
Astartes!
Oh man, this shit looks fire asf, it's actually mind-blowing this teaser, hope in a future they add a story about StarCraft that would be so focking diabolical if it actually happened.    StarCraft deserves justice.
wait, things thats are actually being made for fans?!? count me in!
made me wanna cry tears of joy :)
1:02 IS THAT A FUCKING HELLDIVER? U CAN SEE HIS STRATAGEMS TOP RIGHT
PLEASE DEAR GOD LET THIS GET A SEASON TWO ID LOVE TO SEE SO MANY OTHER GAMES PLEASE GOD
*Everyone Liked This*
Why  there is  gorr  the gods butcher😂
this looks like every gamers dream!
I'm only here for 40k
The creator of Astartes had a hand in this, am I right?
They snuck in concord 😭😭✌️
Fast forward to December and Pacman ends up as the best episode 😂😂
LEAVE MY 40K ALONE AMAZON
Wow so many great IPs. Warhammer, Armoured Core, God of War, and if u cant tell by my avatar, I love D&D too.   God this is going be awesome.
Mega man!!!
Sooooooooo yes
0:53 Keannu Reeves?
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
I thought it was pc game with those graphics 😅😂
Wooooooooooow can’t wait to watch it 🎉
What kind of alternate reality I stepped into?! Epic has actively deleted Unreal Tournament from their history and now just licenced a series that promotes it??? WHATS GOING ON???!!!
Epic story of dead born Concord
THE IMPERIUM REJOICE AT THE SITE OF THE EMPEROR'S ANGLES OF DEATH!!!!!
ARMORED CORE 4 ANSWER?! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What even is this? A movie? Show? Game? I have no idea what's going on anymore 😂
Alright im keeping Amazon Prime
We'll ignore Concord is part of this shall we?
The space marine just dragging the coffin lol
Thats definitly Sifu Club Level. The soundtrack for that is going to be sick.
just give henry cavil full creative control over the live action warhammer 40k series
FOR THE EMPEROR
Everything is cool except concord  It’s just facts
ROFL Concord
An Armored Core short film... Wtf is happening???
The fact that it just said PlayStation when it was showing titles has me pumped
So thought this was a Destiny 2 thing lol
Gave me goosebumps lol, finally something new and creative.
I thought Unreal Tournament was forgotten ;..;
Huh it feels a bit corporate like you know it was born out of a souless cash grab, but ill watch it. I know it will be no love death and robots, which was real art.
Wow this is gonna be great. Been waiting for something like this.
looking forward to it
This player One 2.0 😂😂😂
Oh my God
Let’s goooooooooooooo!!!!!!!
The animation reminds me of arcane. It’s probably made by the same people.
The sound of the bolt pistol at the start is perfection!
Одной Вахи было бы достаточно
Hold up armored core and 40k?! I’m all up for it, glad I still got prime
Syama Pedersen maybe????
Finally, took them this long to do this
WHAAAAAAAAT
paused at the kratos part, bro's in the modern world what
من نفس مخرجين love, death and robots ! ، منتظر
this is a READY PLAEYER ONE level of excitement
This is PEAK!
TIAMAT!!!!!!! I’ve been waiting for some DnD animated content for SO LONG you don’t even know!
Sifu getting its own episode is a very nice suprise.
Okey, that was f*ckin amazing!
My god this better be good
HELL YEAH!!!
MAIN SYSTEM: ACTIVATING COMBAT MODE.
All peak. All hype.       Though that Concord plug in looks like a paid insert…
The astartes and armoured core? Glorious
Crossfire? My favorite FPS shooting game full of hacks and cheats had a Prime episode? wow
Concord 💀
AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope to see - the most Dead Space, Deus Ex, Days Gone and little less Legacy of Kain, Planescape Torment, Mass Effect, Dragon Age Origin, Alan Wake, Max Payne, Darksiders, STALKER, Bioshock, Resistance 3
fucking concord? WHO CARES ABOUT CONCORD???
Insane !!! Dream come reality !!
PAC man?
UNREAL TOURNAMENT, BABY!!!!  LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOO
TITUS RETURNS!
This is going to be insane! I wish it was December already.
For Rubicon, For the Emperor!
revolutionary
0:31  *Eye roll*
Release now please
AMRORED COOORRE ELETS FUCKING GOOOO
Feed the fire  Let the last cinders burn
I would easilly trade this for a new mega man and armored core games.
Activating combat mode.
we need 4k 60fps
BY THE GOLDEN THRONE!
Did anyone else think that was Darth Plagueis in the thumbnail?
Total nerdgasm!!! 😱😱😱
I just had tears in my eyes and reacted like a little child in front of my wife.... THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER AS A GAMER!
UNREAL TOURNAMENT!!!!!!!!
YES finally showing some love for Unreal Tournament!!!
Armoured core? ARMOURED CORE YYEEAAAAAHHHHHH
YES
MEGAMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am going to cry.
ABSURDOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Unreal Tournament and Warhammer....Please, make UT come back from the grave!!!
For the emperor
When the right people get their hands on the right resources anything is possible!
YES YES YES
This looks great
They managed to slip that concord shit in here too.
Yep LFG 😜
I'm so lost by this mystical trailer that I watch over 5 times
Oh, an Amazon Prime series about a buncha different video game series? Eh, just seems to be mostly about current/popular/mainstream games; imagine them giving any sort of a shit about more hood franchises like Mega Ma--  0:47 Hey wait a fucking min--  0:58 OH MY FUCKING GOD!!!!! *monkey noises*  I need to watch this now. Prime Video coming through with that good shit once again.
Is that fuckin Mega Man????
amazon is one fire baby
Prime ..... make a full on space marines series or film please henry cavel aswell and youll make bank
This movie looks awes...Never mind....
Darth Plagueis? Acolyte S2?
PEAK
SUCH A GOOD IDEA !!!!
Warhammer, Sifu, *Armored Core.* Give it to me!
Is that thumbnail a troll on Acolyte? Zihehehe
Bloodborne at 1:17 ?
TIAMAT!?!?!?!?
ASTARTES!!!!
Nerds.         Oh, no, that was a compliment 🤓
"Concord" Enough said.
I think I’m fucking losing it. Please be good. Love, Death, Robots was amazing.
Warhammer 40k bros  ↓
fun fact, its actually NOT a game to play
...Pac-Man?
Magaman looks bad.
Looks insane….
Bro is that Sifu??? 😭
About bloody time!
That 40k looks awesome.... looks kind of like astartes dudes stuff.
Why Not 15 Episodes of Warhammer? I would love to see also Age of Sigmar and Old World😊
Omg
Warhammer, Kratos, Megaman, UT... COUNT ME IN! I did not expect something like this, excited to see that
ARMORED CORE WILL BE REAL IN 4 MONTHS LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
Is that Keanu Revees at 0:53?
This is beyond amazing on so many levels!
MY BOY MEGAMAN IS HERE!!!
Can somebody explain please
Yo warhammer
Amazing.
SIFU LET'S FUCKING GO ! AND ALL THE REST
Concord being the only shitstain on this otherwise glorious masterpiece...i can sortof deal with i guess
WTF was that Unreal Tournament?  Was that Malcolm?
SPACE MARINE!!!!
I hate that “adult animation” has to equal “uber realistic HD high definition graphics” - at least according to the guys behind LD+R…
concord? outer worlds? wuttt
I thought that was darth Plagueis on the thumbnail for a second
Cow Level?!
Darth Plagueis
NEW WORLD MENTIONED WOOOO
I always miss feeling goosebumps like this when seeing a trailer, i don't know what triggers it but... good this one gave it to me.
For The Emperor Brothers And Sisters!!!!
The fact that armored core is getting more love and attention. I can't wait to see what they show in this because omg
Game of Go mentioned! Now I have to watch it…
tf is darth plagueis doing in the thumbnail?
Can it be that hard to make a World of Warcraft series finally???
... _How hasn't something like this been done before??_
Yeah this looks epic!!! 🔥
Love death and robots is fucking sweet I cannot wait for this
40K fans creaming rn…new game  and now this !
Concord was announced and is coming out this year why is it here?
0:51 Keanu Reeves?
I thought this was a Stellaris movie judging from the thumbnail
Y’all canceled Cavil’s W40k show but you’ll release this. Y’all are BUGGING🖕
concord thought people would care
Holy shit…What a pleasant surprise.
"boys we are running out of sequels and I am completely incapable of original thoughts, any ideas?",   "yes, make video games into TV...some more".  lol sigh
Ahh yes an Unreal Tournament short story, a game series you cant buy the fucking games for. Brilliant!
All Titles mentioned: warhammer Unreal tournament a new world D&D outer worlds 2 pac man Honor of kings armored core megaman exodus Playstation spelunky crossfire concord sifu
I thought there was a Cyberpunk 2077 segment...
Assassin's Creed Please
Stop trying to change 40K lore with your own modern day thinking and just give the people what we want cavill 40k
WOOOOOOO
Fck yesssss.. no Love death and Robots but we got this
FINALLY! I have never fully understood why studios haven't used this type of animation for entertainment beyond gaming. Its such a cool style
PAC-MAN!!!!! VAMOSSSSS
PLEASE do the METAL GEAR series justice!
Why did it list concord? that game barely got 2k players in its open beta. It is definitely not "some of the most beloved games"
Is that Darth Plageius in the thumbnail?
WE'RE 40K"ing LET'S GO
Unreal Tournament 😱😱
Wow this is incredible! Absolutely cannot wait!🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
We also need love death robots season 4
bet they DEI the crap out of this.
Warhammer and God of War.  Please don't screw it up, Amazon...
0:22 Idris Elba as Primaris Space Marine (there are 2 golden service studs in his head). The hype was real. The Emperor protects.
First time hearing of this. Fantastic idea, will definitely be popular and I’ll certainly be checking it out
MegaMan is there? Peak
please don't suck please don't suck please don't suck
Holy. Shit. That is all
Kratos?
UNREAL TOURNAMENT?!
Am I actually getting goosebumps?!
So many great games!   and concord.....
40 KAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
CONCORD IS NOT A BELOVED GAME AND WILL FLOP. WTF IS CROSSFIRE ON HERE FOR? WASTING EPISODES ON GAMES THAT FLOPPED IS CRAZY
Please, if there's a second season of this, include Destiny 2
Unreal Tournament is still alive. Thank you!
I hope they'll not destroy wh40k like everything they touched until now.
ARMORED CORE IS THE NIRVANA OF HYPE
Peak
Keanu !!!! <3
Not necessarily a fan of most of these games but it looks promising hopefully we get multiple seasons with more and more games
I saw “From the visionaries behind Love Death + Robots” and I added this to my GOATs playlist.
The fact that we get 15 original stories from "the most beloved video games" and there's Concord in them 💀
🔥
👾👽👾
What an awesome idea!
I'm gonna freeze myself until December. I can't wait that long!
I'm so farkin excited! I'm crossing my fingers this doesn't interfere with the Cavill led 40k show but I'm loving how this looks
My brother sent me this love that man excited
ARMORED CORE?!?!?
Fuckin hell… unreal tournament 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Finally something About Warhammer with Amazon
FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!
Amazon prime games store
Dungeons & dragons sharing space with new world LOL. New World was just added because it's from amazon because the story sucks
PEAK
imma cry
This is also a great way to pitch a new series, looks amazing, can't WAIT
No dark souls? No bloodborne? No elden ring?
0:47  HE'S BACKKKK!!! 0:59 YASSSS I LOVE THIS NEW DESIGN!! ❤❤❤❤
I came here for 40k. That is all.
Warhammer and megaman im in    still not gonna play concord
Love this idea.  It seems like a great format for short video game adaptations, and they've already shown they can do well with this kind of anthology, thanks to LD&R.  Really excited to see what they do with this, even in cases where I'm less familiar with the game they're adapting.
Oh HECK yeah!
Thx prime ! I cant wait to download this..YOINK !
Prime Video Be cooking Fr
Armored Core Hype is so freaking real!
You guys are in talks with Capcom with Megaman, clearly. Dragon's Dogma in Season 2!!
Oh snap there’s heresy going on around here
December? All I want for Christmas is youuuuuuuuuu
Lol no one asked for concord prime
This looks dope.
Im not the only one who saw 40k as astarties right
okay wow
WOW!
Space Marines definitely adding the “Death” and not love or robots to this series IYKYK
FOR THE EMPEROR, LET NONE SURVIVE!   ++BLESSED IS THE MIND TOO SMALL FOR DOUBT++
Not sure what's gonna be more brutal; Warhammer 40k ep or Spelunky 💀
I am beyond hyped for this
Oh my god I wish more studios gave them rights to their IPs. If only Halo, DOOM, and Overwatch could be in here.
The Emperor Protects!
For the emperor!!!
Armored Core? Hell Yeah!
Sees Armored core news   Keanu may be a C4 pilot  Artificial Sky intensifies.  LOOKS LIKE MECHA IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS!
WOW! Armored Core, lets GOOO!!
Warhammer! Yes Please.. 🎉
I am ready for this. I'm excited!  Wonder what were going to see Kratos doing?
Is this why there has been no info of a new love, death and robots season?
really? Concord? I doubt that is going to age well very soon
Armored Core, 40k, &....... Spelunky! wtf
WE GOT ARMORED CORE IN IT FINALLY WHAT WE ALL WANTED HAS BEEN MADE!!!!
this is epic!
People who have never watched  Love Death + Robots, you have no idea what kind of quality you are in for. Its gonna be insane if they live up to the quality and creativity of their previous works
Capcom is whoring out mega man bro 💀
Don't be excited for new product. Probably 90% "message" with bare minimum fan service to get the reddit soys screaming.
Okay anyone else swear that then alien in the thumbnail is a Stellaris design?
OMG OMG OMG!!!! UNREAAAL TOURNAMENT 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Whe need more 40K
So glad they’re finally making a Fortnite show
feel like not adding Doom was a missed opportunity but looks great overall
FOR US❤
SPACE MARINESSSSSSSS
Faith in the God-Emperor is ALWAYS rewarded, brothers.
Ready Player Three 😍
Can’t believe we can actually see the closest to real life Space Marines!  For The Emperor!
What an awesome idea! Cannot wait for this!
No LoL reference?
The angels of his mercy on amazon sign me up.
I hope the Megaman one might lead to something good coming out of capcom from the IP <3
next season better have Uncharted, Metal Gear Solid, Super Mario, Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, Death Stranding, Kirby, a FromSoft game, Resident Evil, Team Fortress 2, BioShock, Metroid, Portal, HALO, Legend of Zelda or else I will eat Jeff Bezos. You have been warned Amazon...
Prime is firing on all cylenders!  Megaman? Oh boy.....  would be interesting if some of these things bled into one another....
i knew it remined me of love, death + robots
I loved Love Death and Robot, if its something similar from then i an gonna be so excited
“Boy, we’re going to Amazon prime Boy”-Kratos
So this is where the "Astartes" guy has been!
Big yes. BIG yes. Sign me up!
Kratos! And were those modern things behind him?! Ooh, that story should be interesting!
I'm so happy Armoured Core is FINALLY getting an animated adaptation after Fort Tower Song never happened! 😊❤ SOOO HYPED FOR THIS!!
The Blue Bomber has returned!
I only have to say this. I am slightly disappointed as having only seen the 40k socials post, i thought this was *solely* 40k related.   I think it will still be good. I just was excited to see a bunch of high fidelity animated warhammer stories again.  But atleast we get .... one . . . ? I guess it will have to do
Sweet.
Prime figured it out, prime knows who we are and what we want!!!!
WARHAMMER!!!
Emperor help you if you screw up Adeptus Astartes.
1:15 Concord, boys. just what everyone wanted, right? XDDDDDDDD
40 kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk YEEEEES
hopefully its not shorts like love death robots
I love this idea so much, can´t wait!!!
i need in 4k!!
I'm the only one that thinks that this looks bad? Maybe I'm just being pessimistic. But why do I get the sensation that this isn't an anthology of stories based on those universes, and more of a "Ready Player One" referential mash-up? I get is an anthology, but at the same time I get the sensation that the connective tissue isn't going to be just stories of these characters from different universes. But something more like "player character hops into virtual reality, and has to personify the protagonists of different franchises to advance through each level". I feel like this bit at 0:49 of Kratos in a modern city adds towards my suspicions. It's not going to be a small chapter of Kratos during his journey to become a better person. It's going to be "oh, shit, we have all these weird videogame characters going through places like New York, or a weird sci-fi space town. How wacky is that?".
wtf is darth plagues doing in the thumbnail
Bro I’m fucking hype
LETS GOOOOOOO IT ACTUALLY LOOKS SO COOL!!
0:47 AAAAAA NÃO ACREDITO MEGAMAN
I'm very hyped, please do more than 15 episodes ❤ 😭
WAIT, DID THEY TURN PAC-MAN INTO A "PHANTASM SPHERE"?!?
WOW! I have been making content and impatiently waiting for Love, Death & Robots next season.   I guess now I only have to be impatient for another few months.
0:50 Kratos in the city from Sony all stars battle royale!??!?! Were gonna see all the characters fight no fucking way
Excuse me, ARMORED CORE!?
CROSSFIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Ok Amazon.. . listening
I want dead space e callisto protocol
I saw some 40k, I'm hyped. It's that simple.
Finally, the film adaptations that video games deserve
thank u amazonnnnn
I only know 40K here, but thats good enough for me-
Not gonna lie, this is an idea that I absolutely love to see. 15 franchises getting some of their most iconic moment animated gives me goosebumps just at the thought of it 😖😖😄  Quick question tho, what the hell is Concord doing on the list ?🤨
UNREAL TOURNAMENT? FINALLY SOME LOVEEE
…….. why, why do we have to wait until December. I want to watch it now 😢
Ermmmm, ❤💀🤖 season 3???...Please?
Emperor be Praised !!   Please don't let the foul Xenos desecrate this !!
Sweet idea
I only saw seconds of it and now I know... WE NEED AN ARMORED CORE MOVIE
THATS SO AWESOME I LOVE LDR, AND its set in actually good game worlds?!!?! THATS SO INSANE
Megaman Is alive ❤❤❤❤❤
holyshit what a roster!!
Can't believe Amazon stole the LDAR creators from Netflix... This will be epic!
Cinema
FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!
That thumbnail be looking like Darth Plagueis.
Who invited Concord?
Spelunky show???
Hell yeah brother
Unreal Tournament? Holy shit
Выглядит круто. Но не стоит надеяться что всё будет так хорошо и гладко Человеческий фактор может испортить даже самую хорошую идею
The best announcement at this Gamescom!
What an amazing soundtrack?
They're really pushing Slopcord hard huh
I swear I thought that was Sidious' master in the thumbnail
ARMORED CORE MENTIONED
ARMORED CORE SWEEP HOLY
Seing Tim Miller crying wen saying "this is our love letter to video games"....I fully trust him and more after the banger thar was Love Death and Robot
That spelunky logo hit me like a bag of bricks. WHAT?! HOW?! I'm so excited!!
Is the Kratos dude from Fornite
Already goated. +10000 Aura for Amazon
Concord is the only L
Какая то сойжаковая версия "Первому игроку приготовиться"
Wait... did Amazon just announce new Kino?
All these little kids didn't even notice Malcom "Thunder Crash" Adams
Darth Plagueis? The thumbnail looks like Darth Plagueis in the awful Acolyte show.😮😵
My wood just sky rocketed outta my room
Y si si sisisisisissiiiii yeees Megaman!!!! 💙🩵💙🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
Whaaaaaaaaaat!?!? I’m shocked I heard nothing about this until this teaser
Concord?  Cant wait for the pronouns🤣🤣
Kratos seemed to be in present day... Is this gonna be a Fortnite situation? Because if so, I get to see Kratos and Mega Man team up against Tiamat...  I'm gonna cry, it's BEAUTIFUL!!!
Fuckin split second of Tiamat using all the breath weapons. Holy shit.   Man, I wish it wasn't coming out in December, but it looks awesome as hell. Keep making this kind of show/movies/content. Prime.
Cant wait to watch all of them except concord.
For people who get mad that chicken tenders aren't on the menu of every single restaurant.
This is a great way for non gamers to get exposed to the great storytelling in video games.
MEGAMAN IS BACK BABY!
Finally, they are noticing what we want.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT BROS ARMORED CORE GETTING MORE SPOTLIGHT LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Yooo this looks sick ngl. Big LDR fan so this'll be interesting
SIFU🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️
unreal tournament  DND looks to be forgotten realms too
Yessssss 🔥
This is such an amazing concept. Lets gooooo
Armored Core!?!?!? And WARHAMMER!? Done by BLUR STUDIOS!? Life is good boys.
Jesus christ what is this
0:50 is this the only spelunky part?
This is wither going to be amazing or absolute trash XD
Nah, Amazon is cooking with this one.
PEAK
Holy shit that’s wild
Oh my god!!!! What amazing 40k serie!!!!!!!!!!!! Too much hype
Ghost and Sifu 😀
They even got black bear cloak Kratos in there with the space marines, man what a time in entertainment
new PIXELS
SIFU LOOKS INSANE
Ok I am really excited for this.
Spelunky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dudeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
PleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisupPleasedontfuckthisup
I can't believe to see Unreal Tournament!
This is one of the best ideas I've seen recently, holy cow. Can't wait to watch it.
So f*cking hyped! Also, guy on stage at gamescom was real. Love the bloke.
Concord? WTF
This stinks of hello fellow kids 😂
🥲🥲🥲🥲
Armored Core, Warhammer, and God of War? Ain't no way I'm missing this.
You can tell this is aimed at a specific type of male gamer....
Concord does not belong here
Armored Core animation?  Best. Day. Ever.
0:48 High tech Facing Worlds, for the Unreal Tournament episode. Holy shit
OH GOD.
I haven't been SO hyped for anything in a long time... I can't wait to watch it and if there ever is going to be a season 2, please consider doing a Legacy of Kain episode pretty pleeeease
Bollocks… I can’t cancel Prime in November!
Yes please!  I hope this doesn't mean Love, Death + Robots is finished. I'd love to see them not only make more, but also create some series or movies off of those shorts.
KRATOS!!?
FOR THE EMPEROR
Bro, what the hell is Kratos doing in a city???
Why is concord included
concord?
FOR THE EMPEROR
Ardmore core let’s go!
I wish they created a series from Tad Williams Otherland that looked like this.
One off animated stories in established video game settings sounds like a blast; really looking forward to this one. Especially the Mega Man one!
god how i wished mass effect was in that list.
Prime is giving Unreal Tournament more love than Epic Games has in a fucking decade
Space Marines!!!!
Megaman pacman and spelunky... then about 7 more games nobody has ever heard of. Lmao wtf is this
Bruh this is amazing
I fly high
SIFU
WARHAMMER AND ARMOURED CORE WHAAAATTTTTTT MIND BLOWWWNNNNNNNN
Sifu alone has me extremely hyped for this! LET’S GOOOO
This looks absolutely incredible.
Actually looks seriously amazing, eagerly looking forward to this.
Another Prime video W
1:07 is that the Root Mother from Remnant??!?!
SPACE MARINES!!!
Dawg this looks so good
Megaman kratos space marines john sifu and pac man im gonna faint
Love Death and Robots with IPs is such an amazing idea
Bet  We’ll take 8 seasons
alright im in you got me
1:00 takes a goddamn truck to the face, walks it off
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET'S GO
Holy shit. This is actually interesting.
So hyped for everything Space Marine 2
Who’s here after getting the email for GW and is like me, very confused about what’s going on?
Kratos and Sifu!!
Now this is cinema
The thumbnail looks exactly like the way the Acolyte did Plagueis so…
why in f*ck is "Concord" mentioned in the description. What a f*cking joke.
NO COOKING MAMA 😡😡
Spelunky will be interesting if it's not just live/die/repeat. That game's about observation and quick thinking, causality and determination.
They're announcing a Funko Fusion show when the game isn't even out yet?   Wait a minute...
Someone tell me I'm not dreaming 😭🥹
No more ldr ????????????? :(
FOR THE EMPEROR!
0:49 kratos.
I think I know what the Astartes Guy has been up to now.
Warhammer Unreal Tournament New World: Aeternum PlayStation  Dungeons & Dragons The Outer Worlds 2 Pac Man Honor of Kings Armored Core Megaman Exodus Spelunky Crossfire Concord Sifu
Armored core,40k, mega man, kratos, counter strike, jin sakai and more lol wow looks so good
It’s not just a random Space Marine Lieutenant! IT’S LIEUTENANT TITUS ALONG WITH A SQUAD OF BLADEGUARD VETERANS!
Secret level! Secret level! On Amazon! Secret secret level!
Very nice, but Concord? Seriously? How much Sony paid to have that piece of garbage on the show?
C R O S S F I R E????? WTF LOL I wanna see this
This could be a good idea and possibly future movies.  As long as they do not ruin any of my favorite games.  Please I'm begging you, do a good job and stay true to any game lore or story.  Animated/CG was a good choice.
Yessss
Praise the Emperor.
So is this like a pilot preview for various potential shows?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Megaman!!!! ❤❤❤
Fortnite, the series
I just jizzed my pants
Bro stinking MEGA MAN ANIMATION??? 40K??? Armored Core???? This is going to be glorious!!
this is so cool!!!! I pray there's a season 2 with more games like the last of us, red dead, BioShock, or cyberpunk but this is still so cool! What a cool idea that i know me and a lot of people are into. This is exactly what we need more of, less remakes and more separate fresh stories from the same awesome worlds and lore. Particularly excited for the DnD ep!
Armored core W
Bring on Unreal Tournament!!!! LETS GO!!!!
i have no idea what this is suposed to be-.-
Time stamp for Jin please? 🥺👉🏾👈🏾
Looks like a video game bruh
Unreal Tournament ❤❤❤❤
👌
Armored Core and SIFU are the reasons why im watching this
ooh naaah prime bouta make peak....
Nerdgasm
SPELUNKY?!?!?????
They actually picked some great franchises this time, like someone here actually, you know PLAYS these things, and sees that these worlds are big enough to allow more stories than their main plot. Even Mega Man, thanks to how expansive it is on a franchise level, can do a lot of good things with it, especially in a one shot format like an anthology series. Yes, I will be watching.
It's awesome, but it's also has Concord on the list, which is worrying
It was a Great Honour for Space Marine at the First Scene.
ARMORED CORE! NOW WE JUST NEED ACE COMBAT!
Oh wow😮
Who is here in 2024?
Kratos in the modern world?? Uhhhh 😅😅😅
SPACE MARINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
awesome, nintendo could stop being stupid and let them use the Metroid series
Hell yeah, warhammer
All our favourite games... and Concorde.
AC an 400k are only good games in the series but its step forward for  gaming
WHERE IS HALO?
C’mon Capcom make a Street Fighter cinematic already. In this modern CG animation, it would be incredible.
Having a DnD in this series is a rare win
Am I missing something or is that a Half Life/Black Mesa nod at the very end when the premier date is shown…???!
I actually LOVE this concept, I really hope they can nail each episode/game. Unreal Tourney episode? That is gonna be so fkn cool.
AN ARMORED CORE ANIME WTFFFF SO COOL
Ok I get it. Rather than giving each of these their own show they start as an anthology series and what clicks with the audience could be expanded into a full series.  Cool
I’m so hyped for this, most of the games I haven’t played but just seeing more from the studio is soo exciting
ow god its like a dream never in a million years did i excpact the love death and robots guys and gals to do something like this
40k ... Lets go.
DnD, Warhammer, GoW. Am I in Heaven?
Zima Blue 2.0
MEGA MAAAAAN!!!! SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT, MEGA MAN!!!
What are all these games doing next to the peak of games spelunky???
praise the omnissiah!
It looks incredible I had chills during the full thing holy hell
WARHAMMER!
Do you know long I have WISHED for an anthology series based on video games!!! Hopefully we get anthology shorts films based on indie shows and movies!
MEGAMAN !
Come on Amazon this isn’t hard just listen to the gamers and it will be a hit !! Can’t wait please
Games listed here:  warhammer unreal tournament new world playstation d&d armored core pacman Honor of Kings armored core megaman exodus spelunky crossfire concord sifu
One more reason why I want to subscribe to Prime Video
Armored core AND 40K????? Dream come true
Omg they’re using the og Tiamat design instead of the new horrendous redesign LFG!!!!
Sifu 🤩🤩
It needs Diablo. They have some pretty amazing cinematics.
0:54 Keanu?
I can imagine this is also a test for every single episode to see which ones garner the most appeal to get their own series
This is going to be the best video game film ever
Thought that was plagues
What a moment to be alive!   PS: Please Amazon, take Halo and The Witcher and make the series that theses games deserve!  Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please.
*Warhammer shown by Blur* I am interested.. *Armored Core by Blur* I AM DEFINITELY INTERESTED
Cant wait for an armored core animation. Check out the cgi trailer released just before the gameplay trailer, to see what it could be like. Probably the only cgi game trailer that got me interested in a game. Sifu is gonna be interesting aswell. And how is kratos in there? I didnt see god of war in the list at the end.
I don’t even understand what was that
*does happy dance* 💃
Unreal Tournament!!!
dude this looks so fucking amazing holy shit. major W
NOICE
SPELUNKY MENTIONED 🗣️🗣️🗣️
OMG this looks sick!!!
ARMORED CORE???? PEAK!!!
WHAT IS THIS MELODY ???
I always said a perfect videogame movie/tv show adaptation can be done just by following the style of their cinematic trailers. That day has finally come!
I HAVE A LAST MISSION FOR YOU, 621... FIND YOUR FREEDOM
Praise the emperor!
unreal fukksn tordament, timmy didn't memoryhold this stuff.
love death robots it's a great resume
"Concord, Crossfire..."  But why
Spelunky is going to be peak
Mega mannnn 🤯🤯🤯
I do hope there's an actual good story here and not just 2 hours worth of empty fan service. No offense.
why was the music No Mans Sky for the first half? Or am i just crazy
So hyped for this, being a lover for most of these would be fun to watch
Megaman <3
Finally 40k gets CG in the quality it deserves. Its been far too long since Astartes and nothing on Warhammer + seems to have come close to this, maybe the Darktide intro but that's about it, in years. I hope this is the beginning of a new era for 40k animations where its epic scale is finally visualized in a way that does the hundreds of books, 3 decades of lore, artwork and sculpts justice.
ARMORED CORE FANS CAPTURING AN IMMACULATE DUB
ARMORED CORE FANS CAPTURING AN IMMACULATE DUB
So let me get this straight. Of all the possible Fromsoft adaptation Its not Dark Souls Not Sekiro or Bloodborne. Not even Elden Ring. Armored Core. MF ARMORED CORE get the honor of the first Fromsoftware tv/movie adaptation?  This is beyond all hype.
Kratos and jim sakai🔥🔥
Where is Dark Souls ?
Expunge everything, except for Warhammer!
Just the fact that they show a Megaman story is enough to justify seeing it.
Pac-Man and Mega Man! Aw snap!
Megaman! ❤
I was kinda hopeful that we would get an announcement of love death and robots season 4, but nonetheless this looks dope
Secret level! Secret level! Through the mountains! Secret! Secret! Secret! Secret level!
They said our favorite games...why the f... is concord in there ? The studio probably got a good deal on the trailer. Well, im still hyped for all the others.
MEGA MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
Only things so far out of gamcon that looks fire
OMG
Can't wait
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ARMORED CORE CINEMATIC IM SCREAMINGGGGGGGGG
This is fucking hype af!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok Megaman's movie adaptation looks sick tho, wth?  Especially the helmet.
THE PAC IS BACK?
Why does this go so hard.
Kratos in the modern world?!?!
Hope they will portray the Imperium of Man as the genocidal dystopian authoritarian nightmare it actually is and not another lame "glorious honorable human that only defend against the evil Xenos" attempt.
0:49 I spy Kratos. 👀
We are living in the golden age of anmation
ALL HAIL OBSIDIAN
40k and Armored Core from the LDR People? Holy shit count me tf in
MEGA MAN, THE SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT!
I'm so excited for this! I hope this take off and each could get their own show
insanely hyped for Armored Core & 40k *reads description* AYYO UNREAL TOURNAMENT TOO? LET'S GOOOOOO
This might be the best Idea ever!!!
Alien, predator, terminator, starcraft, warcraft, overwatch, diablo, resident evil, next ....thank you
I clapped when I saw it!
Nah this is peak
ARMORED CORE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But what if Jak and Daxter
Armored core guys, you know what it means? Fromsoft IPs can make into series/movies  Oh god i hope they do it right
i hope for pronouns
can someone clarify? is this a docu about the games listed(like behind the scenes and stuff?) or a series that tells stories from the games?
PEEEEEEAK
Oh. HECK. YEEESSSS !!!
Can we just make this entire thing about warhammer?
Gonna watch all of them obviously, but can't wait for SIFU and Armored Core!
Hell yeah!
40k!
FOR THE EMPEROR
Make an Uncharted episode for season 2 please
0:19 avatar???
This is so cool! What a great idea!
The Funny part is that the 40k part already looks ten times better than whatever the hell they had on Warhammer +.
VALRAK WHERE ARE YA!?!?
THIS LOOKS AWESOMEEEE!!!!
Where is Netflix's Love Death and Robots volume 4 not out that year possibly in 2025
Concord got their's too? This game is dead on arrival.
JEFF BEZOS YEAH BOI!!!!
Where tf was kratos
the peak of amazon  born here
Warhammer 40k is the best! Lots of these on WarhammerTV worth checking out too!!
Unreal Tournament FTW!!!
what a move to start this with wh40k
Courage and Honour!! For Macragge!! For the Emperor!!
Lets fucking goooo
Imagine kratos will the final boss on this series and kill them all
Armored core... My beloved
Mega Man the only franchise when you can see it in eveywhere except a new game on their own franchise.
SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT
Anyone know the music used for this trailer?
No fighting games? LAME
Lol, New World being in there (no one gives a shit about it) double lol for Concord being there
Yooooo this looks awesome!
Ever since that PlayStation commercial of that narrator guy and all of those battles in those commercials, we finally get a show where Warhammer and God of war and others comics, video games movies and tv series can be in one show greatness awaits and I can’t wait to see more seasons hopefully this will renew them for a couple more in advance
Hot daym
Thank you for listening.
Mega Man My boy
Welcome back, Video Mods.
Beautifull ❤
Unreal Tournament!!! Malcolm at 0:50 !
Mega Man? It is real? I am so hyped!
Oh my F’kin god that looks amazing! I am so sold. Soon as I saw the Astartes I was all in!
Wait... No Halo in a Blur video game anthology series? What is it with that franchise and massively missed opportunities?
PAC MAN AND MEGA MAN???  LETS GOOOOOOOOOO. I LOVE THEIR DEIGSN
Thank you Gamescom ❤
Why can't we get a warhammer 40k animated series like that 😢 45 minutes why can't we
Hell yeah Titus from 40k space marine, im ready for anything 40k . oh the other stuff is pretty cool as well i guess..
Infamous second son?
Unreal Tournament?!? Malcolm? Im gonna cry. This is like the first "official" UT thing in 7 years.
Armored Core and Warhammer 40K. my soul is ready.
This stories are canon ???
I hope we see Odin in this
SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT!!!  MEGAMAN!!!

1)It is fucking awesome! 2)How didn't someone think of this before?!
So this might be why we haven’t seen anything from Syama Pedersen in a while.
Unreal Tournament???? That was completely out of nowhere!
Ghost of Tsushima Episode!
This looks neat but I dont really play any of th--OH MY GOD IT'S MEGAMAN!!! LETS GOOO
Sorry, CONCORD is part of this?? WHO LET BRO ON THE TEAM????!!!
Space Marines and Armor Core fans are eating good this year!!!!!
This got me a little teary eyed. Wow
I already want more and I haven't watched anything besides this trailer, obviously.
Kratos I’ll be there
Concord ep gonna be the best thing about this game
Fans: Fallout was great! Need more game adaptations!  Amazon: How about we give you one of ALL GAMES.
MOAR WARHAMMER!!!!  FOR THE EMPEROR!!!
On the one hand I'm glad to see 1 episode dedicated to the WH40k universe and on the other hand it's a great pity that it's only 1 episode .
Concord lmao
If ALEX MERCER IS IN ONE OF THESE IM GONNA FREAK.
now this is peak
ARMORED CORE AND MEGA MAN YESSSSSSS
Space Marines "Bros why am I the only one dragging this large coffin behind us?"
Spelunky 😭😭😭😭

1:10 - Cross Fire?
I'm in love already ahahaha  😂
Absolutely incredible!🔥
all the amazing games , and there is concord... wtf you guys.
The Emperor Protects
Poor Tzaangors
40k lesssgoooo
Easily the coolest thing to come out of gamescom so far. Whoever thought of something like this at Blur needs a serious raise and bonus.
Sold at Warhammer 40k
MEGAMAN A N D 40K????  pinch me I'm dreaming
MEGAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
Me watching Love Death & Robot Season 1 in 2019 : No fucking way, They are the ones who need to import wH40k into television shows.  Me watching Gamescon in 2024 : NO FUCKING WAY
So dreams can come true... who would have know?
Megaman.... im in!
My Core is so Armored rn
SPACE MARINES 😵😵😵😵😵😵
SIFU AND GHOST OF TSUSHIMA HAS THEIR OWN EPISODES?, WOAHHH OMG THIS IS SO COOL
FOR THE EMPEROR!
Looks pretty nice and also, what a speech by the creator at the Gamescom 🔥
0:49 Kratos in Future? Modern City
How dare you! We demand this now!
Is that an AC with a VOB? A For Answer animation would be hype!
Seem interesting enough. Glad I keep my amazon prime. 😅
All I need is me fockin spelunky
where is bloodborne
This is too good to be true.
MEGAAAMANNNNNM MEGAMANNNN
Premiere date, get here already!!!
Give me more Warhammer 40k!
I'm actually about to cry tears of joy right now
I can remember that amazon made a deal with bioware about mass effect, is that were we gonna see it?
Fire.
UNREAL TOURNAMENT ACKNOWLEDGED???
For the Emperor!!!!!
I LOVE MEGA MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The picture got me-.. Darth plagueis the young.
Of course it's Space Marines. And Primaris Marines at that. Can't actually showcase any of the _interesting_ parts of 40K for whatever reason, I guess.
what is Kratos doing in a modern city? 🤨
Warhammer 40K and seems like Cyberpunk 2077? SIGN ME IN. ♥
Warhammer and Armored Core? Let’s go!!!
Mega Man always shows up at every single possible thing, except new games.  C'MON CAPCOM, WTF
So psyched. Looks freaking sick.
MEGAMAN
I’m speechless.
the hype is real
Armored core hell yea
They finally remade Captain N!
if this gets a season two, PLEASE do Dragon's Dogma. it is such a good concept that I know you guys can do great work with.
Oh yes
So you telling that you have FIFTEEN long high quality cinematics based on game?! NOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY SO HYPED!!!
0:48
Fk yeah hype🎉😢❤
Drop a like if you're hyped 🔥
Looks awesome why concord tho
Louquinha para assisti🇧🇷🇧🇷 robot death love.....❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ARMORED CORE AND UNREAL TOURNAMENT????????
Is Jason Bloodborne gonna be in this?
Mega Man and Pac-Man are just like, "We're not sure why we're here, but we are happy to be included...".
I cried watching this! This is what we have been asking for years!
Yooooo, Mega Man!!! 0:47
Amazing idea, but all I can hope for is a season 2 because this probably costed hundreds of millions of dollars to license and develop and there are like 3 that look worth watching. CONCORD? NEW WORLD? OUTER WORLDS 2? Imagine if we got something like Titanfall, Red Dead, Warcraft, Monster Hunter, dozens of better games to make stories out of.
Concord... Come on 😅
>Concord guys, cmoon. XD
GoW
BRO, KRATOS!!! 0:49
MEGA MAN SWEEP
This is an absurd announcement. Holy shit.
❤❤❤
MEGAMAN MENTIONED
Concord LUL It was even dead before it's announcement
Hermoso si mis ojos no me engañan creo que vi a kratos en este trailer
YES, YES, YES, FINALLY!!! Thanks Blur and Tim.
i cant believe armored core made it in to this!
Me after only seeing the thumbnail: somehow Darth Plageuis returned.
Kratos and Jin sakaï. Sooooooo hype 👌
I Bet there is a secret episode in there. And Armored Core? never would have thought that. this type of show is very good to experiment with lots of video game IP.
MEGAMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WOW
Mmmmm nice
hell fucking yeah, armored core!!!
TIM MILLER IS THE GOAT
Looks amazing❤
Tim Miller really showed how much passion went into this project. It's gonna be an awesome show, can't wait.
The Outer Worlds 2! Let's freaking go!
OUTER WORLDS 2?! MASSIVE W
Looking forward to it!
Surprised that concord is even here as well. Devs were really into develop the lore of that game.  Now it get me curious
THAT WAS KRATOS IN THE MODERN WORLD!?!?
No way there's gonna be a Spelunky episode, i love that game, i originally created my channel just because of it.
Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball please
PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
Awesome idea,day one for sure ❤
TIM MILLER IS A LEGEND
Why is Concord here, the game is already dead 🤣🤣  Looking forward to the series outside of that though!
Finally, something coming to streaming I actually want to watch!  Let's go!
Mega Man in Season 1. Mega Man X in Season 2 please.
No fucking way
This is the most epic and emotional Trailer I've ever seen for a series. Wasn't expecting this
MEGAMANNNNNNNNNN
Spelunky? Really :) and Outer Worlds 2 is teased that way? If this is for December, OW2 needs to be earlier?
Hype forever
SPELUNKY???
all the titles at the end : warhammer unreal tournament New world Aeternum D&D Outer Worlds 2 Pac Man Honor of Kings Armored Core (omg ❤ ❤) Megaman Exodus Spelunky Crossfire Concord Sifu
The Warhammer segments looked awsome.
I am SOOOOOOO EXCITED for the Megaman and DND Episodes!!
AMORED CORE AND GOW??
I SEE KRATOS 0:48 HOLY CRAAAAAP
